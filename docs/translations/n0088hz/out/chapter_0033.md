# Merchant Guild of the Port Town of Velarde

## 港町ヴェーラルドの商人ギルド

(Oh, by the way, my itco had a baby. Congratulations!

*（そういえばイトコが子供産んでました。おめでとう！*

(...... I guess he's younger than me. Oh, I wish I was married too. ......)

*……私より年下なんだわ。あー、私も結婚してぇわぁ……）*


----------------

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I, Karina, was a naked girl, and most of the old ladies were my friends. There were a few young girls here and there, but they were all distant.

*私カリーナ、裸の付き合いでオバちゃんたちは大体トモダチ。若い子もちらほらいたんだけどなぁ、みんな遠巻きにしてたなぁ。*

Why?　Did you think I had ulterior motives?　Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, I'm not a bad girl.

*なんでぇ？　下心バレてた？　ぷるぷる、私悪い女の子じゃないよぅ。*

You can't get along with a girl without the help of alcohol? ......

*お酒の力を借りねば女の子と仲良くはなれぬというのか……*

No, I'm not saying the ladies aren't girls. Yeah, I'm not saying they're not girls.

*いや、おばちゃん達が女の子じゃないとは言わないけどさ。うん。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And so. I came to the merchants' guild, completely cleaned up after my bath!

*と、いうわけで。お風呂ですっかり綺麗になった私がやってきました商人ギルド！*

&nbsp;

I've had old ladies tell me, "Hey, you have to wash this area thoroughly! You tend to forget behind the ears," "What, you don't have a tail? I thought you were an animal in a certain period of its life." I washed my body thoroughly, so there was no need to worry about body odor anymore.

*オバちゃん達にも「ほらココしっかり洗わないと！」「耳の後ろ忘れがちだからねぇ」「なんだ尻尾は無いのかい。てっきりアレな時期の獣人かと」とか言われつつばっちり体中を洗ったので、もう体臭を気にする必要はないってなもんよ。*

At least for today and tomorrow.

*少なくとも今日明日くらいは。*

&nbsp;

Now, I need to find a place to buy alcohol and stock up on lotions.

*「さーて、お酒買ってくれるとこあるかなー、そしてローション仕入れねば」*

&nbsp;

Satitan says that if you ask the merchant guild, they will tell you about stores that sell alcohol.

*サティたん曰く、商人ギルドに聞けばお酒を売れるお店とかを教えてくれるらしい。*

He said Velarde would make a small profit (including expenses) and would be able to buy enough lotion. I wonder how much I can buy.

*ヴェーラルドなら少し利益が出る（経費込み）し、ローションも十分買えるだろうとの事だ。どのくらい買えるかなー。*

&nbsp;

With such excitement, I stepped into the merchant guild and found a pirate inside.

*そんなワクワクした気持ちで商人ギルドに足を踏み入れたところ、中に海賊が居ました。*

Hmm?

*んんー？*

&nbsp;

Hey, is this the merchants guild ......?"

*「あれ、ここって商人ギルド……ですか？」*

Yes, but..."

*「そうだが」*

&nbsp;

No way!　The sailors with bandanas around their necks, and the man with a heavy eye patch wearing a captain's hat with a skull mark on it, they are all pirates!　It's a pirate hideout, no matter how you look at it!

*嘘ぉ！？　バンダナを巻いた船員やら、ドクロマーク付きの船長帽を被った厳つい眼帯のオッサンやら、どうみても海賊なんだが！？　どう見ても海賊のアジトなんだが！？*

Or it's a bar after it's been overrun by pirates!

*あるいは海賊に制圧された後の酒場なんだが！？*

&nbsp;

'Ah ...... miss, is this your first time in Velarde?'

*「あー……お嬢さん、ヴェーラルドは初めてか？」*

&nbsp;

As I was stunned, a man who seemed to be a staff member spoke to me.

*私が呆気に取られていると、職員らしい男の人が話しかけてきた。*

&nbsp;

Oh, yes. It's my first time."

*「あ、はい。初めてです」*

"Then you must be thinking right now, 'This looks like a pirate hideout.

*「なら今お嬢ちゃんは『まるで海賊のアジトだ』と思ったことだろう」*

Yeah, well.

*「ええ、まぁ」*

That's about right. Pirates are a kind of merchant of the sea."

*「大体合ってる。海賊は海の商人の一種だしな」*

&nbsp;

Pirates - privateers. Those who make their living by taking cargo from ships that do not have a trading license. They are apparently "public servants" who have permission from the government.

*海賊――私掠船乗務員。交易許可のない船から積み荷を奪うことを生業とする者たち。なんと国の許可を得ている『公務員』であるらしい。*

&nbsp;

I see. ...... So I shouldn't be able to attack pirates and take their treasure without their permission?

*そうなのか……じゃあ勝手に海賊を襲ってお宝奪うとかしちゃだめなのかぁ。*

&nbsp;

They've just finished their work. They're in a state of excitement, so you'd better stay away from them. So what can I do for you?"

*「丁度彼らも一仕事終えたところでね。興奮状態だから近づかない方が良いよ。それで何の用かな」*

'Uh, yes. Tell me where I can sell liquor and where I can stock up on lotions."

*「あ、はい。酒を売れる場所とローションを仕入れられる場所を教えてください」*

I understand that you don't have a liquor license. Lotion is a powder?　The liquor wholesaler--"

*「酒免許は無いってことだね、了解。ローションは粉末のかい？　酒問屋は――」*

&nbsp;

Oh!　Sake!　I'll buy it for you!　I just needed some booze."

*「おう！　酒か！　俺が買ってやろうか！　丁度酒が欲しかったんだ」*

&nbsp;

A pirate interrupts me and the staff member's conversation. He is wearing a captain-like hat and an eye patch.

*私と職員さんの話に割り込んでくる海賊の人。船長っぽい偉そうな帽子に眼帯だ。*

People in this world often get involved with me, what's with that?　Is it because I'm beautiful?

*この世界の人よく絡んでくるんだけどなんなん？　あ、私が美人だからか？*

&nbsp;

"Officials, does this person have a liquor license?"

*「職員さん、この人酒免許持ってます？」*

You don't have ......, although up to three bottles would be a good place to start as a private transaction."

*「……持ってないね。３本までなら個人取引としていいところだけど」*

Then I guess I'll just have three bottles. The price is--"

*「じゃあ３本だけかなぁ。代金は――」*

Here we go!

*「ほらよっ！」*

&nbsp;

He says so and throws three copper coins with a churning sound.

*そう言って、ちゃりんちゃりん、と銅貨３枚を投げてくる。*

Three copper coins scattered on the floor.

*床に散らばる３枚の銅貨。*

&nbsp;

An?

*あん？*

&nbsp;

'Pick it up quick. Yeah, I could buy you a night."

*「さっさと拾えよ。ああ、お前を一晩買ってやってもいいぞ」*

I said, "Mr. Official, that man dropped his money. Or was he trying to pick a fight?"

*「職員さん、あの人お金落としましたよ。それとも喧嘩を売りに来たんですかね」*

Mr. Gomez!　It's against the law for guild members to tangle with each other!

*「ちょ、ゴメスさん！！　ギルド員同士の揉め事は御法度ですよ！」*

I heard the lotion and everything. I could hear the lotion and stuff, you know?　You use it, I'll deal with it."

*「いいじゃねぇか。ローションとかも聞こえたぞ？　お前が使うんだろ、相手してやるよ」*

&nbsp;

He then tried to hug my shoulder with a breath that reeked of alcohol, and I shrugged it off.

*そう言って酒臭い息で肩を抱こうとしてきたので、私はするりと身をかわした。*

Don't touch me with your dirty hands after I've cleaned you up at the bathhouse, okay?

*せっかく風呂屋で綺麗にしてきたのに汚い手で触るんじゃねぇよ？*

&nbsp;

Totally different from Blade-senpai - or, come to think of it, was Blade-senpai like this, too?　Hmmm, I wonder if this Gomez is a nice guy too: ......

*まったくブレイド先輩とは大違い――いや、よく考えるとブレイド先輩もこんな感じだったっけ？　うーん、このゴメスってのもいい人だったりするんだろうか……*

&nbsp;

'Hmph, if you want to buy me, you'll have to bring me a hundred gold coins, drunk.

*「フッ、私を買いたければ金貨１００枚持ってくるんだな、酔っぱらい」*

A hundred?　Well, if you're going to be my girl, I might consider it."

*「１００枚か？　そうだなぁ、俺の女になるなら考えてやらんでもないぜ」*

&nbsp;

The pirate Gomez replies to my decisive line after fighting off Blade-senpai.

*ブレイド先輩を撃退した私の決め台詞に海賊ゴメスがそう返す。*

Seriously? Pirates make that much money?

*マジかよ。海賊そんな稼げんの？*

&nbsp;

No, well, no. He seems very stingy."

*「いやまぁダメだけどな。めっちゃケチみたいだし」*

What?　What's so petty about me?"

*「は？　俺様のどこがケチだって？」*

Are you even smart?"　Three coppers there proves that you are a cheapskate. No woman would fall for a little guy like that.

*「頭も悪いの？　そこの銅貨３枚とかドケチの証明じゃん。そんなちっちぇえ男に靡く女なんていねーわ」*

&nbsp;

And it's not "I'll do it," it's "I'll think about it. After all, you're the one who won't give it to me.

*しかも「やる」じゃなくて「考えてやる」だし。結局くれないやつじゃん。*

&nbsp;

Who's little?

*「だ、だ、だ、誰がちっちぇぇだと！？」*

Oh?"　I wonder if there is a man with a small vessel who gets angry at this level?　Where is he?　Who's too small to see?　Who's smaller than your pinky finger?

*「お？　この程度で怒っちゃう器の小さい男がいるのかなぁー？　どこどこー？　小さすぎて見えないヤツぅー？　小指よりちいさいヤツなんておりゅぅー？」*

"ーーー！！！！"

*「ーーーーッ！！！！」*

&nbsp;

Oh my goodness, Mr. Gomez, your face is so red.

*あらあら、ゴメスさんお顔が真っ赤ですことよ？*

Did you get so turned on by my pinky finger bending gesture?

*そんなに私が小指クイクイ曲げる仕草に興奮しちゃった？*

&nbsp;

"Hey, what are you trying to stir things up!"

*「ちょ、あなた何煽ってるんですか！」*

Eh?"　I don't like it, staff. If you get angry at this, it means you admit you have a small capacity, right?　If you are a person of large capacity, this has nothing to do with you at all. Hmm?　Don't tell me, Mr. Staff, that there are people with such small capacity here?

*「えー？　やだなぁ職員さん。これで怒るのは自分の器が小さいと認めるってことでしょ？　器の大きい人なら全く関係ない話だって。ん？　まさか職員さん、ここにそんな器の小さい人がいるとおっしゃってる？」*

"............ No, I mean!

*「…………いえ、その！？」*

Whoosh, whoosh ......!"

*「フーッ、フーッ……！」*

&nbsp;

I'm sorry, staff. I didn't mean to drag you into this.

*ごめんねー、職員さん。巻き込んじゃって。*

Gomez breathing as best he can.

*精一杯呼吸を整えてるゴメス。*

If I get angry here, I will admit that I am a small person. Hmmm...

*ここで怒ったら小物って自分を認めちゃうことになるもんねぇ。フフフ。*
