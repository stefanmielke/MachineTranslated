# Let's show off to Mashiro-san.

## マシロさんに自慢しておこう。

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I ran into Mashiro-san after her bath at the base.

*拠点にて、風呂上がりのマシロさんと出くわした。*

Since I have the chance, I should show off the equipment I got from Aisia's hometown to Mashiro-san.

*折角なのでアイシアの故郷で手に入れた装備をマシロさんに自慢しておこう。*

&nbsp;

“Mashiro-saan! Look, look, I got a bunch of things from Aisia's hometown!”

*「マシロさーん！　見て見て、アイシアの故郷で色々手に入れたよー」*

“Oh, it seems like you got a lot of stuff.”

*「おお、なんか色々増えてんな」*

“Look at this, it's a revolver. I can shoot it like crazy with dual-wielding!”

*「ほら見て、これリボルバー拳銃。二丁拳銃でバンバン撃ちまくるよー」*

&nbsp;

I took the gun out of the holster and aimed it sideways. I don't point it at people.

*銃をホルスターから出してちゃきっと横に構える。人には向けない。*

&nbsp;

“A gun, huh? It's quite different from what the Beebays had.”

*「銃か。ビーベイ達の持ってたのと随分ちげーな」*

“That one was more of a concealed weapon among guns.”

*「あれはむしろ銃の中でも隠し武器にするために偏ってたやつだよ」*

&nbsp;

At least compare it to a musket. Pirates used those too.

*せめてマスケット銃と比べておくれ。海賊も使ってたやつ。*

&nbsp;

“This one is a special model that can shoot six times.”

*「こいつは６連射できる特別製なんだ」*

“That's amazing. Does it work on monsters?”

*「そりゃすげぇ。魔物にも効くのか？」*

“It depends on where you hit. The wounds are small and harder to take down than with a rapier, but it has power.”

*「当たり所次第だね。傷口は小さくてレイピアより倒しにくい、けど威力はあるから」*

“Well, Karina has magic too, so... more importantly.”

*「ま、カリーナには魔法もあるしな。……それよりもだ」*

&nbsp;

Mashiro-san's gaze was focused on the pouch, ring, and hair accessory.

*ぢー、とマシロさんの目線はポーチと指輪、髪飾りのあたりに注目していた。*

By the way, the cup and knife are in the pouch.

*ちなみにコップとナイフはポーチの中だ。*

&nbsp;

“Fufufu, you have a good eye. This is a gift I received from a local wife in the Dwarf village.”

*「ふっふっふ、お目が高い。こちら、ドワーフの里で現地妻から貰ったプレゼントです」*

“A local wife from the Dwarves... What are you doing???”

*「ドワーフの……現地妻っておまえ。なにしてんの？？？」*

“Something like, it just happened?”

*「なんかこう、なりゆきで？」*

&nbsp;

Tehepero.

*てへぺろ。*

&nbsp;

“Is it like, if you receive a confident work from a Dwarf, you get married? I heard it's like that. But it's not such a heavy thing. It's not like I'm being bound or anything.”

*「ドワーフ的に自信作をプレゼントして受け取ったら結婚、みたいな？　らしくて。でもそんな重いもんじゃないんだって。別に拘束される訳でもないし」*

“Oh, I see... So, since you didn't return it, that means you accepted it.”

*「ああ、そういう事。……で、突っ返してねぇってことは受け入れたってわけか」*

“Well, she was cute, and I had no reason to refuse. ...Also, I have this cup and knife!”

*「まー、可愛かったし、断る理由もないし。……あとこんなコップとナイフもあるよ！」*

“Wow, five of them... Wait, hold on. Hey, what is this? Huh? Wait a minute?”

*「へぇ５つも……ってかおい。おいこれ、え？　オイ。ちょっとまて？」*

&nbsp;

Mashiro-san, who was staring intently at the gifts from the Five Elders, started to look confused.

*五大老から貰ったプレゼントをじぃーっと見ていたマシロさんが困惑しだす。*

&nbsp;

“...Did the person who made this, happen to be an incredible craftsman? I can sense the magic enhancement.”

*「……これ作ったの、とんでもねぇ職人じゃねぇか？魔法付与を感じる」*

“That's right. By the way, the materials are Arthur-kun's fangs and scales.”

*「そうなんだよ。ちなみに素材はアーサー君の牙とか鱗とかで」*

“So that means it's dragon material!? No wonder it has magic enhancement! And a Dwarf craftsman, no, this isn't just that. This is an incredible... super incredible craftsman. Even I, an A-rank adventurer, couldn't get my hands on this.”

*「つまりドラゴン素材じゃねーか！？　そりゃ魔法付与も載るわ！！　しかもドワーフの職人、いや、そんだけじゃねぇな。凄腕……超凄腕の職人だろこれ。Ａランク冒険者のアタシでも手に入れられねぇぞ」*

“Oh yeah, I heard they're called the Five Elders.”

*「ああうん。なんか五大老とかいうらしいよ」*

“Th-the Five Elders!?”

*「ごっ、五大老ォ！？」*

&nbsp;

Mashiro-san coughed. Gah, cough, she choked.

*マシロさんがむせた。げほ、ごほっとえづく。*

Are you okay? Do you want some water? You can use the cup.

*大丈夫？　お水飲む？　コップ使っていいよ。*

&nbsp;

“Y-you mean... the Five Elders... such big shots were at Aisia's place...”

*「おま……ご、五大老って……そんな大物がアイシアんとこにいたのか……」*

“Would you like to get something made next time, Mashiro-san? I can introduce you.”

*「今度マシロさんもなんか作ってもらう？　紹介しようか？」*

“Idiot, I can't pay the commission fee!! No, wait, I'll save up. I will definitely save up, so please introduce me then!!”

*「バカ、依頼料払えねぇよ！！　いや、まて、貯める。ぜってぇ貯めるからそしたら紹介してくれ！！」*

&nbsp;

Huh? Wait a minute. Mashiro-san is an A-rank adventurer, right?

*ん？　ちょっとまって。マシロさんＡランク冒険者だよね？*

And she can't just pay the commission fee? How high is it?

*それで依頼料がポンッと払えないってどんだけ高いのさ。*

&nbsp;

“So, which of the Teshin Five Elders did you charm?”

*「で、お前はテッシン五大老の誰を口説いちまいやがったんだ？」*

“Huh? They're the Five Elders, though.”

*「え？　五大老だけど」*

“So, out of the Five Elders, who was it?”

*「だから、五大老のうちの、誰をだよ」*

“Huh? I told you, they're the Five Elders.”

*「え？　だから、五大老だけど」*

&nbsp;

Mashiro-san froze.

*マシロさんが固まった。*

&nbsp;

“Wait. Hey, wait. Could it be that those five incredible pieces of equipment...”

*「まて。おい、まて。もしかしてその、５つのとんでもねぇ装備……ッ」*

“They each made one for me! All five of them were super cute little girls, you know? Well, actually, they're not really little girls, but I don't really understand Dwarf ages, so to me, they're little girls.”

*「１人１個作ってくれたんだよね！　５人とも凄く可愛いロリっ子でね？　まぁ実はロリじゃないんだけど、ドワーフの年齢とか良く分かんないから私にはロリだし」*

“Show me the engravings! If they're confident works, they should have their names on them!”

*「ちょっと銘見せろ！　自信作ってんなら入ってんだろ！？」*

&nbsp;

Engravings. If it's a proposal item, it seems normal to have your name on it.

*銘。確かにプロポーズの品っていうなら、自分の名前入れておく方が普通な気がする。*

So, I showed Mashiro-san the five pieces of equipment... Oh, so that's where the engraving was.

*と、マシロさんに５つの装備を見せる……へー、そんなとこに銘入ってたんだ。*

&nbsp;

“The Five Elders... all of them... Seriously?”

*「五大老……全員……マジか」*

“Oh. They said if I didn't want them, I could sell them to cover my travel expenses, but I'm definitely not selling them!!”

*「あ。要らなかったら売って旅費の足しにしていいって言ってくれたんだけど、絶対売らないからね！！」*

&nbsp;

Since they're marked, even if they're stolen, I can get them back.

*マーキングしてあるから、たとえ盗られても手元に戻せるし。*

&nbsp;

But I could lend them to Mashiro-san if she wants.

*でもマシロさんになら貸してあげてもいいよ。*

I have space magic, so I don't really need the equipment, but for Mashiro-san, the pouch, knife, hair accessory, cup, and ring would be useful.

*私自身は空間魔法があるから使わなくても良い装備ばかりだけど、マシロさんにはポーチとかナイフとか髪飾りとかコップとか指輪とか便利だろうし。*

&nbsp;

But there wasn't anything that wasn't useful.

*って便利じゃねぇやつがなかったわ。*

&nbsp;

“...I'm kind of scared that if I borrow them, I'll incur their wrath.”

*「……なんか借りたら怒りを買いそうで怖いんだが」*

“They're all cute and nice, so that won't happen. Mashiro-san is one of my important people! I especially like this ring, do you want to try it on?”

*「みんな可愛くていい子だしそんなことないよ。マシロさんは私の大事な人の一人だし！　この指輪とか特にお気に入りだけどちょっとつけてみる？」*

“W-well, just for a moment...”

*「じゃ、じゃあちょっとだけ……」*

&nbsp;

Just as Mashiro-san was about to slip the ring onto her finger.

*と、試しに指輪をマシロさんが輪に指を通しかけたその時。*

&nbsp;

The ring disappeared.

*指輪が消えた。*

&nbsp;

“Huh? Wait!? The ring disappeared!?”

*「ん？　あれ！？　指輪消えた！？」*

“Hey, Karina, your finger.”

*「おいカリーナ、指」*

&nbsp;

Where Mashiro-san pointed, the ring had returned to my left hand's ring finger.

*マシロさんが指さした先。私の左手薬指に、指輪が戻っていた。*

&nbsp;

“...Phew. I see, it must have a theft prevention feature, huh? So that's why they said it was okay to sell it.”

*「……ホッ。なるほど、盗難防止機能かな？　だから売ってもいいって言ったのかぁ」*

“If it comes back after being sold, that's a free-for-all. Don't sell it... no, wait. Hey.”

*「売った後戻ってくるとか、売り放題だな。売るんじゃねぇぞ……じゃなくて。オイ」*

&nbsp;

By the way, I could lend everything except the ring, but if I didn't declare that I was lending them, they would automatically return to me if taken a certain distance away.

*ちなみに指輪以外は貸すと宣言して渡したら貸せたけれども、そうでなければある程度私から離れた位置に持っていくと自動で手元に戻ってくるようだった。*

This is definitely because I used my potion as a secret ingredient. No doubt about it.

*これ絶対隠し味に私ポーション使ってるのが功を奏してる。間違いない。*

&nbsp;

“Probably, the ring comes back quickly because it's life-threatening. A feature that loves you! Ah, how cute. I love them all!”

*「多分、指輪は命に関わるからすぐ戻ってくるんだね。愛が嬉しい仕様！　はー、可愛いかよ。みんな好きっ」*

“Is that really okay with you!? ...Cursed equipment... well, if you say it's fine, then okay. So, it's covered in spit, huh? You're liked too much... Seriously, what did you do...”

*「お前それでいいのか！？……呪いの装備……いや、良いってんならいいけどよ。つまり唾つけられまくってる、と。気に入られ過ぎだろ……マジで何をどうしたんだ……」*

&nbsp;

Cursed equipment? No, no, it's at most a curse. They're little girls, after all.

*呪いの装備？　いやいや、せいぜいお呪いだよ。ロリっ子だもん。*

Selling that would be outrageous! Or something like that.

*それを売るなんてとんでもない！　とかそういう系のだよ。*
