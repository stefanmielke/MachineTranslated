# It's a simple job to lightly remind someone.

## 軽く釘をさす簡単なお仕事です。

&nbsp;

I was to receive the sacred artifact from the king again.

*改めて王様から神器を受け取ることになった。*

Maria would take the post to the castle, so I would disguise myself as a healer and wait for the signal.

*マリア婆がポストを城に持って行ってくれるので、私はヒーラーに変装して合図待ち。*

Once I received the signal, I would take the sacred artifact from the king and casually remind him, "I'll let it slide this time, but don't steal from people."

*合図をもらったら王様から神器を受け取り、ついでに「今回は許すけど、人から盗むなよ」と軽く釘をさす簡単なお仕事です。*

&nbsp;

...Oh, the signal card has been dropped into the post. Well then, I'm off!

*……お、合図の札がポストに投函されてきた。じゃあ行ってきまーす。*

&nbsp;

＊　＊　＊

&nbsp;

Although there are no windows, it is a fairly luxurious room. It seems to be a hidden room in the royal castle.

*窓はないものの、それなりに豪華な部屋。王城の隠し部屋らしい。*

The healer suddenly appeared at an altar that seemed to have been hastily constructed there.

*ヒーラーはそこに簡易的に作られたと思われる祭壇にニョキッと出現した。*

&nbsp;

There were three people besides me.

*そこにいたのは、私以外には３人。*

One was Maria. She was in a chic dress suitable for nobility. It looked more formal than when we had tea the other day, and she stood next to the post placed on the altar.

*一人はマリア婆。お貴族様モードのシックなドレスだ。先日お茶会したときよりフォーマルな感じで、祭壇に置かれたポストの隣に立っている。*

One was the king. Dressed in a typical royal outfit with a crown and a red cloak, he knelt at the altar, or rather, towards me.

*一人は王様。王冠を被り、赤いマントを身にまとったいかにも王様という格好のまま、祭壇に、というか私に向かって跪いている。*

The last one was the large bodyguard I had seen the other day. He was also in blue armor, kneeling slightly behind the king.

*最後の一人は先日も見た護衛の大男。こちらも青い鎧を着て、王様の斜め後ろに控えつつ跪いている。*

&nbsp;

"......Raise your face."

*「……面を上げよ」*

&nbsp;

As I recited the line we had discussed with Maria, the king raised his face and looked at the healer.

*マリア婆との打ち合わせ通りにセリフを言うと、王様が顔を上げヒーラーを見た。*

...Um, what am I supposed to do next? I looked at Maria.

*……えっと、これからどうすんだっけ？　とマリア婆を見る。*

&nbsp;

"Your Excellency. This is our country's king, King Pavelkant III."

*「使者様。こちらは我が国の王、キング・パヴェルカント三世にございます」*

"Y-yes. We met the other day. I apologize for not being able to talk much."

*「う、うむ。先日会ったな。あまり話が出来ずすまなかった」*

"No! Your Excellency, I was the one who was rude the other day."

*「いえ！　使者様、こちらこそ先日はとんだご無礼を」*

&nbsp;

The king bowed his head again as he said this.

*そう言って再び頭を下げる王様。*

Rude? Did something happen...? I only remember being extremely rude myself.

*ご無礼？　なんかあったっけ……むしろこっちがご無礼しまくった記憶しかない。*

&nbsp;

"Your Excellency, it seems that the captain of the royal guard, Goei, pointed his sword at you."

*「使者様、こちらの近衛騎士団長、ゴウェイが剣を向けたそうで」*

&nbsp;

Wait, he didn't draw his sword, did he? He just had his hand on the hilt, right?

*あれ、剣抜いてなかったよね？　柄に手をかけてた程度じゃん？*

&nbsp;

"Did that happen? I only remember him being a loyal and good subordinate. Treat him well."

*「そんな事あったか？　職務に忠実な良い臣下だとしか記憶にないな、大事にせよ」*

"Y-yes! Thank you, Your Excellency!"

*「は、ははぁ！　ありがとうございます使者様」*

&nbsp;

Even though they were on the red carpet extending from the altar, the king and the bodyguard were bowing their heads so low that their foreheads nearly touched the floor.

*祭壇から延びる赤い絨毯の上とはいえ、床に頭が付く勢いで頭を下げていく王様と護衛の人。*

I feel so important. This is awkward.

*ってか、私超偉そう。気まずいよぅー。*

Maria, this is okay, right? I was told to act really important!

*マリア婆、これでいいんだよね？　私超偉そうにしておけって言われたけども！*

&nbsp;

"Your Majesty, the apostle seems to be troubled, so that should be enough."

*「陛下、使徒様が困惑しておりますので、そのくらいで」*

"Yes!"

*「はっ」*

&nbsp;

The king raised his face again.

*改めて顔を上げる王様。*

&nbsp;

"I feel bad for taking your time, so let's proceed with the sacred artifact."

*「使者様のお時間を頂戴するのも心苦しいので、早速神器の方を」*

"Yes. Goei."

*「はい。ゴウェイ」*

"Yes!"

*「はっ」*

&nbsp;

Saying that, the large bodyguard—the captain of the royal guard—took out the fake sacred artifact, the "Wall-Breaking Hammer," from a small bag. It was a lightweight, hollow object that couldn't break walls and made a silly sound like a toy hammer.

*そう言うと護衛の大男――近衛騎士団長は小さな袋から神器『破城壁槌』――の偽物を取り出した。中身が空洞で軽くて、城壁も破壊できずピコッと鳴るマジモンのピコピコハンマーである。*

&nbsp;

It was first handed to Maria, and then the healer received it.

*それはまずマリア婆に渡され。そしてそれをヒーラーが受け取る。*

&nbsp;

"I have certainly received it. --Ah, right. As a reward for returning the sacred artifact, I will allow you to steal this time. I had a lack of communication as well. I will speak to Tesshin about it."

*「確かに預かった。――ああそうだ。神器返納の褒美として、今回だけは泥棒をしたことを許す。我の伝達不足もあったのでな。テッシンには我から話を通しておく」*

"......Yes! Thank you very much!"

*「……はっ！　ありがとう存じます！」*

&nbsp;

The king's face relaxed a bit.

*どこかホッとした顔になる王様。*

&nbsp;

"To reiterate... due to numerous sacred artifacts, the world's energy balance is in the negative. Therefore, I have been commanded by the gods to recover the sacred artifacts. However, this does not mean the world will perish in ten years. As long as the gods watch over this world, for now, we are still safe."

*「改めて伝えると……数多の神器により、世界のエネルギー収支がマイナスなのだ。故に、我は神様より神器回収を命じられている。しかしこれは、１０年ですぐに世界が滅ぶという話ではない。神がこの世界を見守っていれば、今のところはまだ大丈夫なのだ」*

"I-I see. I jumped to conclusions..."

*「そ、そうでしたか。早合点を……」*

"Maria, ahem. Maria Belle. It seems I have caused a misunderstanding on that point."

*「マリアば、げふん。マリアベルよ。その点、誤解させてしまったようだな」*

"I sincerely apologize. It is my fault."

*「大変申し訳ありません。私の落ち度でございます」*

"It is fine. We have managed to obtain one sacred artifact like this."

*「よい。こうしてひとつ神器を手にできたのだからな」*

&nbsp;

At this point, I used spatial magic to open a hole in the ceiling.

*と、私はここで空間魔法で天井に穴を開く。*

On the other side was a "blindingly bright space." Then, I gently stored the fake sacred artifact there using spatial magic.

*その先は『やたら発光して眩しい空間』。そして、偽神器を空間魔法でふわりとそこに仕舞った。*

&nbsp;

"Oh... this is the work of the gods...!"

*「おぉ……これが、神の御業……！」*

&nbsp;

Actually, this is a performance that I am considering with Mi-chan and the others for the sacred artifact return ceremony.

*実はこれ、神器返納式のためにミーちゃん達と検討中の演出である。*

The king seems so moved; it looks like it could be officially adopted.

*王様がこれほど感動してるし正式採用してよさそうだなぁ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"By the way, since we're at it, let me heal some of your physical ailments."

*「そうだ、折角だしついでに貴殿の身体の不調も少し治してやろう」*

"Eh?"

*「え？」*

&nbsp;

With that, I hopped down from the altar and lightly touched the king's head.

*と、私は祭壇をよっこいせと降りて、王様の頭にちょんと手を触れる。*

With Massage Level 5, even this level of contact is enough to have a significant effect, so let's relieve that shoulder stiffness!

*マッサージＬｖ５ならこのくらいの接触でも十分に効果があるのだ、さぁ肩こりを解消してやるぜ！*

&nbsp;

By the way, his body is in bad shape. It must be tough for someone of the king's stature. Stress has caused his stomach to...

*ってか体内がボロボロ。王様ともなるとそこらへん大変なんだね。ストレスで胃が……*

...This is stomach cancer. Let's scan. ...Hmm, it hasn't metastasized. Well, since I'm at it, I'll extract it with spatial magic. I'll tidy up the empty space and copy-paste to fill it.

*……胃ガンだこれ。えいスキャン。……んんー、転移はしてないな。じゃ、ついでだし空間魔法で摘出。空いたトコは適当に整えコピペして詰め。*

&nbsp;

It's easier than growing limbs!

*手足生やすより楽でいいね！*

&nbsp;

"W-what is this... my body feels light... the pain in my organs has disappeared...?!"

*「こ、これは……身体が軽く……臓腑の痛みが、消えた……！？」*

"Yes. It seems you were suffering from some illness. I removed the affected area."

*「うむ。なにやら病気だったようだな。病巣があったので取り除いておいた」*

"Thank you... Your Excellency...!"

*「あり、がとうございます……使者様……！」*

&nbsp;

Tears started to fall from the king's eyes.

*ポロポロと涙を零す王様。*

You're welcome. I know your job is tough, but hang in there.

*どういたしまして。お仕事大変だろうけど頑張ってねー。*

&nbsp;

"Now, I shall take my leave. Moderation in work is important."

*「では我は帰る。仕事もほどほどにな」*

"Your Excellency's departure."

*「使者様の御帰りです」*

&nbsp;

Maria gave me a look that seemed to say, "What on earth did you do!?" Taking advantage of the fact that the king was crying, she made a fierce expression.

*マリア婆が『一体何したんだい！？』と目で言ってきた。王様が泣いて見えないのをいいことに凄い顔。*

Um, was it bad to heal him? I guess there will be a reflection meeting later... Is it okay to skip out?

*ええと、治しちゃまずかった？　こりゃあとで反省会かなぁー……バックレちゃだめ？*
