# How about it, Dad? You're knowledgeable, right?

## どうだ、父ちゃん物知りだろ？

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As we progressed through the cave, there was a very large open area.

*洞窟を進むと、とても大きく開けた場所があった。*

It was like a dome with an open ceiling, and the sky was visible above.

*天井の開いたドームのようになっていて、上には空が見えている。*

Gray stone square buildings were lined up. There were also fields.

*石造りの灰色で四角い建物が並んでいた。畑もある。*

&nbsp;

It seems this village was made by hollowing out the peak of a rocky mountain, creating a bottom that resembles a cup.

*この里は岩山の山頂をくりぬいて、コップのようになった底に作られているようだ。*

&nbsp;

"How do you get drinking water in a place like this? Rainwater?"

*「こんな場所で飲み水とかってどうしてんの？　雨水？」*

"Huh? It's magic."

*「え？　魔法ですけど」*

&nbsp;

Magic is convenient.

*魔法って便利。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Now, we were guided to the village chief's house, which was a bit larger than the other lined buildings—rather, it seemed to be the chief's room.

*さて、そうして案内されたのは並んだ建物の中でも一回り大きい里長の家――もとい、里長の部屋らしい。*

The whole village gives the impression of being one house, with each building being a 'room.'

*里全体でひとつの家というイメージで、建物ひとつひとつは『部屋』だそうな。*

&nbsp;

As I greeted him while handing over the sake as a gift, the village chief, Mr. Rahman, who is the father of Aishia and Sati (though he is the chief, he treats others of similar age as siblings), welcomed us with open arms.

*手土産の酒を渡しながら挨拶したところ、アイシアやサティたんの父親（血縁的にはともかく里長が父親で他は大体近い年代なら兄弟姉妹という雑な扱い）の里長、ラフマンさんは諸手を挙げて私達を歓迎してくれた。*

&nbsp;

"Welcome, esteemed guests! Let me welcome you!"

*「よう来なすったお客人。歓迎しよう！」*

&nbsp;

He was a splendid dwarf with a red beard and a muscular build.

*立派な赤鬚の筋肉モリモリドワーフさんだ。*

In his hand was already an opened sake bottle. He was drinking it even though I had just handed it over.

*その手には既に蓋の開いた酒瓶があった。今渡したのにもう飲んでる。*

In fact, it seemed he took a quick sip saying, "I got thirsty after the greeting."

*というか「挨拶して喉が渇いたな」と、くいっと引っ掛けてる。*

&nbsp;

"Dad, you're too excited."

*「父ちゃん、はしゃぎすぎ」*

"Well, you say that, Pastel. To begin with, didn't you think Aishia was already dead? I never expected her to return home with such beautiful young ladies."

*「とはいうがなパステル。そもそもアイシアはもう死んだかと諦めてただろ？　それが酒、もといこんな美しいお嬢さん方と一緒に里帰りしてくるとは思わなかったしな」*

&nbsp;

Pastel, Sati's younger sister—who, like Sati, was a pure dwarf with brown skin and red hair. There was almost no difference in physique, just a slight difference in facial features—rebuked the chief.

*サティたんの妹のパステルちゃん――こっちはサティたん同様純粋なドワーフで、褐色赤髪だった。顔つきが違う程度で体格差もほぼなし――が里長を諫める。*

&nbsp;

Also, he just mentioned sake. His true feelings are leaking out.

*あと今酒って言ったな。本音漏れてるぞ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"Wait, does that mean I no longer have a room here?"

*「あれ、それじゃあ私の部屋はもう無いんですか？」*

"I cleaned it up the day after you left the village. Now it's being used by Ghana and his daughter."

*「そもそもお前が里を出た翌日には片付けたぞ。今はガーナが娘と使ってる」*

"What? Ghana had a child!? ...My younger sister got ahead of me...!"

*「え、ガーナ子供出来たの！？……妹に先を越された……っ」*

&nbsp;

Oh, it seems there have been various changes in family relations at the home I hadn't contacted.

*おう、連絡してなかった実家では色々と家族関係に変化があったようだ。*

Indeed, if a younger sister or brother has a child before you, it can lead to quite complex feelings. I can only imagine.

*確かに妹や弟が自分より先に子供産んだら色々複雑な心境にもなるわな。想像しかできないけど。*

&nbsp;

"It seems you fell into slavery, but I'm relieved to see you're doing well, Aishia."

*「奴隷落ちしたみたいだが、元気そうで安心したぞアイシア」*

"Yeah. Oh, just so you know, I have no intention of leaving my master's protection. If I were to worry about unnecessary things, I think I would actually die."

*「うん。あ、先に言っておくけど私はあるじ様の庇護から抜ける気一切ないからね。余計な気を回したらむしろ死ぬと思って」*

"…There's no way I'd do something like that to someone who commands a dragon. Your way of thinking is still frightening; who did you take after?"

*「……ドラゴン従えてるお人にそんなことするわけないじゃないか。相変わらず発想が怖いな、誰に似たんだ？」*

&nbsp;

This is the first time I've seen Aishia like this. It's refreshing.

*私もこんなアイシア初めて見たよ。新鮮だぁ。*

Huh? What is it, Dia-kun? ...Ah, when you said unnecessary worries, did you mean assassinating me? Thanks for the clarification. Wow, Aishia has really come alive since coming to this village.

*え？　何ディア君？……あー、余計な気を、って、私を暗殺ってこと？　補足ありがとう。いやー、アイシアこの里に来てからホント生き生きしてるなぁ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"However, that means that bringing you to the dwarf village means the three of us will participate in a drinking party, right?"

*「しかしあれだ。ドワーフの里に連れてきたということは、３人で酒宴に参加するってことか？」*

"Uh, um... What should we do, Master? Should we participate?"

*「え、あー、うーん。どうしましょうあるじ様？　参加します？」*

"A drinking party? A celebration for Aishia's survival? Then I guess we should participate since it's a rare occasion."

*「酒宴？　アイシア生還のお祝い？　なら折角だし参加しようかなぁ」*

"Oh, no. To put it simply for those outside the village—uh, it's like an annual matchmaking party? It involves physical relationships, though."

*「あ、いえ。里外の人に分かりやすく言うなら――あー、年に一度のお見合いパーティー、みたいな？　肉体関係を伴うやつですが」*

"Oh, never mind then."

*「あ、やっぱいいです」*

&nbsp;

I was about to be baptized in the free-spirited culture of the dwarves.

*早速ドワーフの奔放文化の洗礼を浴びるところだったよ。*

When I glanced at Dia-kun, he was blushing.

*ちらっとディア君を見ると、顔を赤くしていた。*

&nbsp;

It's okay, Dia-kun, I'll protect you! I promised Mashiro-san too!

*大丈夫、ディア君は私が守るよ！　マシロさんとも約束したもん！*

&nbsp;

"Well, if it's just about planting seeds, that's fine for men, but for women, it's different. Besides, that elf over there is still questionable if she can conceive. With her height, she might be a fine woman for a dwarf, but for an elf, she should still be a child. ...How about it, Dad? You're knowledgeable, right?"

*「そうだな。種をまくだけでいい男ならともかく、女じゃな。それにそっちのエルフさんはまだ孕めるかどうかも怪しいはずだ。この背丈でドワーフだったら立派な女だが、エルフ的にはまだ子供のはず。……どうだ、父ちゃん物知りだろ？」*

"Ah, Dad. Dia-sama is technically a boy."

*「あー、父ちゃん。ディア様は一応男です」*

"What!? ...Huh? She looks like a girl to me. Why is she dressed like a girl? Is it an elf culture thing?"

*「何！？　……え？　どう見ても女なのだが。なぜ女の格好を？　エルフの文化か？」*

"…There are deep reasons behind it."

*「……深い事情があるんです」*

&nbsp;

By the way, it was mentioned that "even if it's a boy, we won't let a child without a beard participate."

*ちなみに「流石に男でも髭の生えてない子供は参加させないぞ」とのこと。*

Good for you, Dia-kun, your chastity is protected!

*よかったねディア君、貞操は守られたよ！*
