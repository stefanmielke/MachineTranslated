# What do you think, Dad, you know things?

## どうだ、父ちゃん物知りだろ？

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As we proceeded through the cave, we found a very large open area.

*洞窟を進むと、とても大きく開けた場所があった。*

It is like a dome with an open ceiling and the sky above.

*天井の開いたドームのようになっていて、上には空が見えている。*

The buildings were stone, gray, and square. There are also fields.

*石造りの灰色で四角い建物が並んでいた。畑もある。*

&nbsp;

This village seems to have been carved out of the top of a rocky mountain and built on the bottom of a cup-like structure.

*この里は岩山の山頂をくりぬいて、コップのようになった底に作られているようだ。*

&nbsp;

How do you get drinking water in a place like this?　Rainwater?"

*「こんな場所で飲み水とかってどうしてんの？　雨水？」*

What?　It's magic, but..."

*「え？　魔法ですけど」*

&nbsp;

Magic is useful.

*魔法って便利。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We were then led to the house of the village head, which was one of the larger buildings in the row of buildings - or rather, the room of the head of the village.

*さて、そうして案内されたのは並んだ建物の中でも一回り大きい里長の家――もとい、里長の部屋らしい。*

The entire village is a house, and each building is a "room.

*里全体でひとつの家というイメージで、建物ひとつひとつは『部屋』だそうな。*

&nbsp;

When we greeted him while handing him a bottle of sake as a souvenir, Mr. Rahman, the village head who is the father of Aisia and Satitan (the village head is the father, not by blood, and the others are roughly treated as brothers and sisters if they are close in age), welcomed us with open arms.

*手土産の酒を渡しながら挨拶したところ、アイシアやサティたんの父親（血縁的にはともかく里長が父親で他は大体近い年代なら兄弟姉妹という雑な扱い）の里長、ラフマンさんは諸手を挙げて私達を歓迎してくれた。*

&nbsp;

"Welcome, my guest. Let us welcome you!"

*「よう来なすったお客人。歓迎しよう！」*

&nbsp;

He is a muscular dwarf with a magnificent red beard.

*立派な赤鬚の筋肉モリモリドワーフさんだ。*

In his hand was a bottle of sake with the lid already open. I just gave it to him, but he is already drinking it.

*その手には既に蓋の開いた酒瓶があった。今渡したのにもう飲んでる。*

Or rather, "You're thirsty after saying hello," and I'm hooking them up with a bite.

*というか「挨拶して喉が渇いたな」と、くいっと引っ掛けてる。*

&nbsp;

Dad, you're too excited."

*「父ちゃん、はしゃぎすぎ」*

You say, "I know what you mean, Pastel. I mean, Pastel, you gave up on Isiah when you thought she was already dead, didn't you?　I didn't expect her to come back home with a bottle of sake and all those beautiful ladies.

*「とはいうがなパステル。そもそもアイシアはもう死んだかと諦めてただろ？　それが酒、もといこんな美しいお嬢さん方と一緒に里帰りしてくるとは思わなかったしな」*

&nbsp;

Pastel, Satitan's younger sister - like Satitan, this one was a pure Dwarf with brownish-red hair. The only difference between them was in their facial features, and there was almost no difference in their physiques.

*サティたんの妹のパステルちゃん――こっちはサティたん同様純粋なドワーフで、褐色赤髪だった。顔つきが違う程度で体格差もほぼなし――が里長を諫める。*

&nbsp;

And you just said alcohol. You're letting your true feelings out.

*あと今酒って言ったな。本音漏れてるぞ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Oh, so my room is gone then?"

*「あれ、それじゃあ私の部屋はもう無いんですか？」*

'I put it away the day after you left the village in the first place. Now Ghana is using it with her daughter."

*「そもそもお前が里を出た翌日には片付けたぞ。今はガーナが娘と使ってる」*

I was like, "Oh, Ghana, you're having a baby! My ...... sister beat me to it!"

*「え、ガーナ子供出来たの！？……妹に先を越された……っ」*

&nbsp;

Oh, there have been a lot of changes in family relations at my parents' house that I hadn't heard from.

*おう、連絡してなかった実家では色々と家族関係に変化があったようだ。*

Surely if your sister or brother had a baby before you, you would have a lot of mixed feelings about it. I can only imagine.

*確かに妹や弟が自分より先に子供産んだら色々複雑な心境にもなるわな。想像しかできないけど。*

&nbsp;

I'm glad to see you're doing well, Isiah, even though you seem to have fallen into slavery."

*「奴隷落ちしたみたいだが、元気そうで安心したぞアイシア」*

I'm not going to leave the protection of Aruji-sama at all. I'm not going to leave Aruji-sama's protection at all. I'd rather die if I give you any unnecessary attention.

*「うん。あ、先に言っておくけど私はあるじ様の庇護から抜ける気一切ないからね。余計な気を回したらむしろ死ぬと思って」*

"How could I do that to the gentleman who follows the ...... dragon? Your ideas are as scary as ever, who do you think you are like?"

*「……ドラゴン従えてるお人にそんなことするわけないじゃないか。相変わらず発想が怖いな、誰に似たんだ？」*

&nbsp;

I've never seen Isiah like this before. It's fresh.

*私もこんなアイシア初めて見たよ。新鮮だぁ。*

What?　What is it, Deere? ...... Oh, you mean assassinate me, as in, "extra care"?　Thank you for the addition. Wow, Isiah, you've been so lively since you came to this village.

*え？　何ディア君？……あー、余計な気を、って、私を暗殺ってこと？　補足ありがとう。いやー、アイシアこの里に来てからホント生き生きしてるなぁ。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

But that's it. If you brought them to the dwarves' village, does that mean the three of us are going to join in the feast?"

*「しかしあれだ。ドワーフの里に連れてきたということは、３人で酒宴に参加するってことか？」*

What shall we do, Aruji-sama? What shall we do, Aruji-sama?　Do you want to join us?"

*「え、あー、うーん。どうしましょうあるじ様？　参加します？」*

A "spree?　A celebration of Isiah's return?　If so, I might as well join in.

*「酒宴？　アイシア生還のお祝い？　なら折角だし参加しようかなぁ」*

Oh, no. To put it plainly for people outside the village - uh, like an annual blind date party, right?　The kind that involves physical relations."

*「あ、いえ。里外の人に分かりやすく言うなら――あー、年に一度のお見合いパーティー、みたいな？　肉体関係を伴うやつですが」*

Oh, I'm good.

*「あ、やっぱいいです」*

&nbsp;

I was almost baptized into the Dwarves' unrestrained culture earlier in the day.

*早速ドワーフの奔放文化の洗礼を浴びるところだったよ。*

I glanced at Mr. Dear and saw his face blushing.

*ちらっとディア君を見ると、顔を赤くしていた。*

&nbsp;

Don't worry, Dear, I'll protect you!　I made a promise to Mr. Masirow too!

*大丈夫、ディア君は私が守るよ！　マシロさんとも約束したもん！*

&nbsp;

I guess so. I don't care if it's a man who just needs to sow his seed, but it's a woman. Besides, it is doubtful that the elf over there can conceive yet. If she were a dwarf of this stature, she'd be a fine woman, but from an elf's point of view, she'd still be a child. How about ......, Dad, you know things, don't you?"

*「そうだな。種をまくだけでいい男ならともかく、女じゃな。それにそっちのエルフさんはまだ孕めるかどうかも怪しいはずだ。この背丈でドワーフだったら立派な女だが、エルフ的にはまだ子供のはず。……どうだ、父ちゃん物知りだろ？」*

'Ah, Father. Master Dear is a man, in case you were wondering."

*「あー、父ちゃん。ディア様は一応男です」*

What!　...... What?　I'm a woman no matter how I look. Why are you dressed as a woman?　Is it elven culture?"

*「何！？　……え？　どう見ても女なのだが。なぜ女の格好を？　エルフの文化か？」*

I'm ...... deep in it."

*「……深い事情があるんです」*

&nbsp;

Incidentally, he said, "I won't let a kid with no beard participate, even if he's a guy in quicksand.

*ちなみに「流石に男でも髭の生えてない子供は参加させないぞ」とのこと。*

Good for you, Dear, your chastity is protected!

*よかったねディア君、貞操は守られたよ！*
