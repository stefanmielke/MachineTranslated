# If I were to be honest about everything, the king would cry.

## 全部正直に言ったら王様泣いちゃうよね

&nbsp;

Well, well, well.

*さてさて。*

Aside from Tessin, the Land of the Dwarves, where the return ceremony is being prepared, we will discuss the fake "Breaking Wall Hammer" that was stolen by the thief Hermes.

*返納式の準備が進むドワーフの国テッシンはさておき、怪盗ヘルメスに盗まれた偽『破城壁槌』について。*

&nbsp;

This is Grandma Maria, the former wife of the former Lord of Velarde, who contacted me to say that she had recovered a sacred artifact and wanted me to receive it. There may have been some dispute at that time.

*こちらはヴェーラルド前領主夫人ことマリア婆から『神器を回収したので受け取ってほしい』と連絡があった。その際いくつか悶着があったとかも。*

&nbsp;

...... Yeah. Well, what the heck. One of the agonizing things, the mysterious man chasing the sacred object, is me.

*……うん。その、なんだ。悶着のひとつ、神器を追う謎の男ってのは私だね。*

At any rate, I sent the letter as a preemptive step and then came to Velarde.

*とりあえず、先ぶれとして手紙を送ってから、ヴェーラルドへとやってきた。*

I've left a post box so I can go right to it...............

*ポスト置いてあるからすぐ行けるんだよねー、これが。*

&nbsp;

Grandma Maria, are you there?"

*「マリア婆ー、いるー？」*

I've been waiting for you, Kari. Huh, you're giving me a headache."

*「待ってたよカリちゃん。はぁ、頭が痛い事態になってるねぇ」*

&nbsp;

When I entered the room, a tea party was being prepared.

*部屋に入ると、お茶会の用意がされていた。*

The host is Grandma Maria, wearing a dress that is less revealing and more roomy. The dress is richly embroidered with threads of the same color as the cloth, which is very prestigious, and one can tell at a glance that she is a noblewoman.

*ホストはマリア婆で、露出が少なく部屋着なドレスを着ている。布と同じ色の糸で刺繍がたっぷり入っているのが格調高く、お貴族様だ、と一目で分かる。*

&nbsp;

Well, it's not so easy when you have one elbow on the table and beckon to them every once in a while.

*まぁテーブルに片肘ついてちょいちょい手招きしてるあたり、気安いけど。*

&nbsp;

My bath friend, a lady attendant, pulled out a chair for me, and I greeted her lightly with a "Hi, how are you?" and sat down.

*風呂友達のおばちゃん侍女が椅子を引いてくれたので、「どもっす」と軽く挨拶して座る。*

&nbsp;

I'm sorry. I was just doing some stuff in Tessin."

*「いやー、ごめんね。丁度私もテッシンで色々しててさぁ」*

Was it the return ceremony mentioned in the letter?　Well, let's see if we can find a way to get rid of it."

*「手紙にあった返納式だっけ？　まぁ、私らでいろいろ落し処を探ろうじゃないか」*

&nbsp;

Yeah, I lightly told him about the situation in a letter, and he decided to find out where he dropped it off.

*うん、軽く事情を手紙で話したところ、落し処を探ることになった。*

&nbsp;

The king and others have their own faces and circumstances. I'm sure he was prepared to go all the way to such an unsafe place.

*王様とかにも面子とか事情があるわけだし。わざわざあんな治安の悪そうなところに本人が行くとか覚悟もあっただろう。*

And that's all due to my lack of communication, like a poke or something. ...... And the one I got is a fake, man.

*それが全部私の連絡不足によるポカとかさぁ……しかも手に入れたのが偽物だぜ？*

&nbsp;

If I were to be honest about everything, the king would cry. He seems like such a nice guy.

*全部正直に言ったら王様泣いちゃうよね。すげー良い人っぽいのに。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Should Mee be there too?　Do you want me to call her?"

*「あ、ミーちゃんも同席したほうが良い？　呼ぶ？」*

I'm at ......, wait a minute. Who is this Mee-chan?"

*「……まってくれ。そのミーちゃんってのは誰だい？」*

'Let's see, ...... she's a Dwarf girl. What did you say your real name was? ...... Uh, well, Queen?"

*「えっと……ドワーフの子だよ。本名なんつったっけかな……あー、まぁ、女王？」*

"Lord Vermillion?　You've got to be kidding me, that's a little too much disrespect!"

*「バーミリオン様かい！？　ふざけんじゃないよ、流石に不敬が過ぎるだろ！？」*

&nbsp;

Old Maria is upset and clinks her tea utensils with a small clink.

*動揺してカチャッと小さく茶器を鳴らすマリア婆。*

Your surprise is so elegant, I'd probably spew tea if I were you.

*驚き方が上品だわ、多分私だったら紅茶噴いてるね。*

&nbsp;

I met Old Maria in the bathtub, right?　I didn't know it, but I made her my local wife. So if you call her, she'll come right away. Don't worry, she's a good girl.

*「いやー、マリア婆とお風呂で知り合ったじゃん？　同じように知らなかったけど現地妻にしちゃってぇ。だから呼べばすぐ来るよ。大丈夫いい子だから」*

'Don't do it, it'll cut my stomach. Local wife?　What did you do ...... No, no, no, don't tell me. Oh, I'm dizzy."

*「やめとくれ、胃が削れる。現地妻？　何したんだい……いやいい、言わなくていい。あー、眩暈がするわ」*

&nbsp;

Old Maria pressed her eyes with that.

*そう言って目元を押さえるマリア婆。*

I'm kind of sorry. No really, I feel bad, just a little bit.

*なんかゴメンね。いやホント悪いと思ってるよ、少しだけ。*

&nbsp;

'Well, he said he'd leave it all up to me, so I don't really care.'

*「まぁ、私に全部任せるって言ってたし、別にいいか」*

I'm not sure I'd be able to do that. That's a lot of responsibility. ......"

*「おいそりゃ全権大使ってことじゃないか。責任重大だね……」*

&nbsp;

Anyway, I share the situation again.

*ともあれ、改めて状況を共有する。*

That the "Divine Artifact Returning Ceremony" be held the following weekend. That the one in Tessin is the real one and that Hermes had the fake one stolen. That Mee is cute. Dia is an angel. And that they have started keeping a new dragon and a slime. Well, the second half was mostly chat.

*次の週末に『神器返納式』を行う事。テッシンにあるのが本物で、ヘルメスには偽物を盗ませた事。ミーちゃんが可愛い事。ディア君が天使なこと。あと新しくドラゴンとスライムを飼い始めた事。まぁ後半はほぼ雑談だったが。*

&nbsp;

......, you'd think I wouldn't be surprised anymore, but they just keep popping up."

*「……もう驚かないって思っても次々出てくるねぇ」*

I'm having a great time every day. Thank God."

*「あはは、楽しい毎日だよ。神様に感謝ってね」*

&nbsp;

I heard from Grandma Maria that Dia's sister, Ms. Kumin, was having a lot of trouble while chatting. Well, I guess she still has her luggage with her.

*マリア婆からは雑談ついでにディア君のお姉さん、クミンさんが色々ゴタついていることを聞けた。そういやまだ荷物預かりっ放しだものなぁ。*

&nbsp;

I drink a cup of tea and eat a cookie as a snack.

*ずず、とお茶を飲み、お茶請けのビスケットを食べる。*

A slight sweetness spread in my mouth. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. I might want to eat this with some ...... cheese.

*ほんのりした甘さが口に広がった。うまー。……チーズとか挟んで食べたいかもコレ。*

&nbsp;

I'd appreciate it if you would accept the fake vessels as authentic. "I would also like to keep it a secret and not make it public," he said. It would also be a problem if the king had them stolen.

*「偽神器については、本物って体裁で受け取ってもらえると助かるんだが。ついでにそのあたりは秘密裏に、公な形にはしたくないんだ。王が盗ませたってのも問題だしね」*

I'll go out dressed as a healer. Oh, you mean the mysterious man chasing after the sacred artifact, because that's my disguise."

*「じゃあヒーラーの格好して出向くよ。あ、神器を追う謎の男ね、私の変装だから」*

I knew it!

*「やっぱりかい」*

&nbsp;

Oh. I thought it was a perfect disguise, but I guess old Maria knew just by listening to you.

*おう。完璧な変装だと思ってたのに、マリア婆には話を聞いただけでバレてたか。*

&nbsp;

I knew when I got the letter. Well, I didn't know anyone else who could slip in and out of a room perfectly well protected by the Kingsguard and still be somewhat ditzy.

*「手紙貰った時点で分かったんだよ。まぁ他に近衛兵の守護を完璧にすり抜けて部屋を出入りするような存在なくせにどこかおっちょこちょいな奴を知らないってのもあるが」*

'Huh, I guess the deciding factor is that I'm too awesome?'

*「フッ、私が凄すぎたのが決め手かな？」*

Mr. King said he didn't know what he was doing here after all.

*「結局何しに来たんだか分からなかった、とキング様は仰ってたね」*

&nbsp;

Yeah, I was actually going to collect it right there, but I accidentally forgot. Sorry.

*うん、本当はあの場で回収しようと思ってたけどうっかり忘れてたんだ。ゴメンて。*

&nbsp;

I heard you said something about 'thieves are not good.　King was very concerned about it. He was wondering if it was a messenger of God, and if there would be a divine punishment.

*「あと、『泥棒はよくない』とか言ったんだって？　キング様がいたく気にしていてね。あれはもしや神の使いだったのではないか、天罰が下るのでは、と」*

You said it. I told you."

*「うん言ったね。言った」*

&nbsp;

I remember it well because I put myself on the shelf and said it.

*自分の事を棚に上げて言ったからよく覚えている。*

&nbsp;

I would like you to say something like, "When you hand over the sacred artifact to Kari, I would like you to say, 'As a reward, I forgive you for this one time.　I'll give you something in return.

*「こう、神器の受け渡しの時に『褒美として今回だけは許す』とか言ってやってくれないか？　私からカリちゃんに何かお礼するからさ」*

I'm fine with that. Oh, can you wrap up these tea cakes?　I'm sure everyone will enjoy the cookies. I hope you have some cheese, too, because it goes well with alcohol, and I think Mee and the others will like it.

*「オッケー、別にいいよ。あ、じゃあこのお茶菓子包んでもらえる？　ビスケットとか絶対みんな喜ぶよ。チーズもあるといいな、挟んで食べたらお酒にも合うからミーちゃん達も喜ぶと思うし」*

I'll give you a new can, and you can have as many as you want. I'll give you a can of the new stuff, take as much as you want."

*「……ったく、お人よしだねぇ。新品を缶でやるよ、好きなだけもってきな」*

&nbsp;

Oh, fatty!　That's the former wife of a former lord!　Thank you!

*おー、太っ腹！　さすが前領主夫人だね！　あんがとー！*

Well, I'm glad it seems to have come full circle. That's what I expected from Grandma Maria.

*いやー、丸く収まりそうでよかったよかった。さすがマリア婆。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;



&nbsp;

----------------

(Old Maria sells her favors to the king and Karina in exchange for a few cans of cookies. Great job, ......!)

*（ビスケット数缶と引き換えに王様とカリーナちゃんに恩を売りまくるマリア婆。すごい手腕だ……！）*
