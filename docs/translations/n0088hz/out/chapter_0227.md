# Deer-kun vs. sister (full-body type bear beastman) (second half)

## ディア君VSお姉さん（全身タイプ熊獣人）（後半戦）

&nbsp;

A lot of people like a well-trained woman."

*「鍛えられた女の人がイイって人も多いのよね」*

Is that so ......?"

*「そうなんですか……？」*

I wonder if it's too early for you. Mmm-hmm."

*「お嬢ちゃんにはまだ早かったかしら。うふふ」*

&nbsp;

And from there, Dear-kun won four in a row, and the bear sister's right arm was completely unleashed. Or rather, it seems as if he deliberately lost in order to get serious.

*と、そこからディア君は４連勝し、熊お姉さんの右腕が完全に開放された。というか、本気を出すためにわざと負けていったように思える。*

&nbsp;

"Slap it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-paper!"

*「「叩いてかぶってジャンケンポン！！」」*

&nbsp;

The sister won, and at the same time, a stick was gently placed on Dear's head.

*お姉さんの勝利、と同時に、ディア君の頭にそっと棒が乗せられた。*

&nbsp;

"......?

*「……ッ！？」*

"Phew, finally a win!"

*「ふふっ、やっと一勝できたわぁ」*

&nbsp;

A frighteningly fast blow. If it weren't for me, I would have missed it.

*おそろしく速い一撃。私じゃなきゃ見逃しちゃうね。*

He rocketed with his left hand, and right after that, his right hand was moving. And I had enough time to care for Mr. Dear.

*左手でジャンケンし、その直後には右手が動いていた。そして、ディア君を気遣うだけの余裕もあった。*

Who are you to overpower Mr. Dear, who is dressed in a dress made by the Five Great Old Factories, or who are you, this sister? ......

*五大老工房製ドレスで身を固めたディア君を圧倒するとか、何者だよこのお姉さん……！*

&nbsp;

Dia removes one of the garter rings she borrowed from Misha, which was attached to her wrist. As Misha looks at it, he suddenly realizes what it is.

*ミーシャから借りたガーターリングのうち、手首に付けていたやつを外すディア君。それを見つつ、ミーシャがハッとその正体に気が付く。*

&nbsp;

I remembered Dia's opponent ......!　Mwah, I didn't know that bloody bear was competing ......!

*「ディアちゃんの相手……思い出したニャ！　むぅっ、よもやあの血まみれ熊が出場しているとは……！」*

Do you know, Misha?

*「知っているのかミーシャ！？」*

Oh ...... she is a fighting whore who is a hunter as a hobby!　Her daring yet delicate technique, which she performs from her well-developed muscles, is very popular among military men. ......"

*「ああ……あの人は趣味でハンターをやってる、戦う娼婦にゃ！　鍛え抜かれた筋肉から繰り出される大胆かつ繊細なテクが軍人に大人気だとか……」*

&nbsp;

Hmm?　Is being a hooker more your day job?

*んん？　娼婦の方が本業なの？*

&nbsp;

"He fell in love with her muscles and asked her to marry him, but she refused, saying, 'I want a stronger male than I am,' and she overwhelmed him in an arm-wrestling match. ...... It seems that her first love was General Garou!"

*「その筋肉に惚れて身請けを求められても、『私より強い雄がいいわ』と腕相撲で圧勝して断るとか……初恋はガロウ将軍らしいにゃ！」*

You really know your stuff, Misha. How good are you at the combat side of things?"

*「マジで詳しいなミーシャ。ちなみに戦闘方面の腕前は？」*

He is a fighter," he says. "He beats up a wild bear with his bare hands and is ridiculed for it. His fighting style is that of a fighter.

*「野生の熊を素手でボコボコにして『どっちがモンスターか分からないぜ』と揶揄われるレベルかにゃ。戦闘スタイルは格闘家にゃ」*

&nbsp;

What's that? It's strong. Can you win, Deere?

*なにそれ強い。ディア君勝てるのかな？*

&nbsp;

"You seem like a power type, but you're faster than Misha, aren't you?"

*「パワータイプっぽいのに、ミーシャより早くね？」*

I'm fast," he said! ...... maybe ...... probably ...... probably ...... well, yeah ......"

*「私のんが早いにゃ！……たぶん……おそらく……まぁ、うん……」*

&nbsp;

Misha answers without confidence.

*自信なく答えるミーシャ。*

&nbsp;

Dey, Dia-chan!　Do your best!　Don't let him get up there for me and beat him!

*「でぃ、ディアちゃん！　がんばるにゃーーーー！　私の為にもそいつを上に上げないで倒しちゃってーーーー！！！」*

I'm just trying to cheer myself up.

*「身も蓋もねぇ自分のための応援ウケるんだけど」*

You should be cheering for Deere, too!　You too, Dia-chan, cheer up!"

*「うっせー！　おめーもディアちゃん応援しろにゃ！」*

Go for it, Dia!"

*「がんばれディアくーん！」*

&nbsp;

Dear was so focused on the rock-paper-scissors that I wasn't sure if he could hear my cheering.

*ディア君は私の応援が聞こえてるかどうか分からない程、ジャンケンに集中していた。*

&nbsp;

However, the other sister doesn't seem to have much interest in winning.

*しかし、相手のお姉さんはあんまり勝つ気がない模様。*

When he puts on his helmet in rock-paper-scissors, he is slow and accepts Deer-kun's attack on his head with a snap.

*ジャンケンで兜をかぶる時はゆっくりで、ディア君の攻撃をぱこんと頭に受け入れている。*

&nbsp;

"Oh no, I lost again!"

*「あーん、また負けちゃったぁ」*

&nbsp;

Whenever he said this and removed his bracelet with a slap, some of the audience members gulped and swallowed their saliva. What kind of a person are you? Are you a fiery fighter when a powerful enemy is powered up?

*そう言ってずしーんと腕輪を外すたびに一部の観客がごくりと生唾を飲んでいる。どういう性癖なの。強敵がパワーアップすると燃える戦闘民族さんか？*

&nbsp;

And here, the bear sister speaks to Dia-kun in a whisper.

*と、ここで熊お姉さんがディア君に小声で話しかける。*

The volume of the voice is inaudible to the audience, but it's eavesdropping with spatial magic.

*観客に聞こえない声量だが、空間魔法で盗聴だ。*

&nbsp;

Well," he said. Now that all the bracelets are off, ...... I have five more clothes to go. In the meantime, I'm going to take some of this off too, okay?　Girl."

*「さて、と。これで腕輪は全部外れたわけだけれど……私の服はあと５枚。その間に、こちらも多少は脱がさせてもらうわよ？　お嬢ちゃん」*

"......!　You mean to tell me you didn't intend to win right from the start?"

*「……！　最初から勝つ気はない、と？」*

I'll give it to you if you want me to be serious about it all the way through, but it doesn't really benefit me that much. I have enough money and I want to ...... show everyone this physical beauty as soon as possible."

*「最後まで本気出してほしいなら出すけれど、私にそれほどメリットないのよね。お金は十分持ってるし……早くこの肉体美を皆に見せつけたいのよ」*

&nbsp;

Ah. I see, the type that likes exposure and participates in conventions.

*あ。なるほど、露出好きで大会参加してるタイプ。*

Is the bracelet an impatient play on the audience?

*腕輪は観客への焦らしプレイですかそうですか。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

So, then Deer-kun got all the garter rings on his arms, and when they were all taken off, the bear sister took them all off. Deer-kun won.

*で、その後ディア君は腕に付けていたガーターリングを全て取られたところで、熊お姉さんが全部脱いだ。ディア君の勝利だ。*

&nbsp;

And the audience was super excited. Mainly the beasties.

*そして会場は超沸いた。主に獣人たちが。*

Part of the quiet seems to be foreigners who are not traveler beasts like me.

*一部静かなのは私同様旅行者の獣人じゃない外国人の模様。*

&nbsp;

"Hmph, I didn't think you'd surrender until you took it all off. ......!"

*「フッ、まさか全部脱ぐまで降参しねーとはにゃ……！」*

I don't see any difference between a full-body type bear-beastman or a normal wild bear, do you see something different in a beastman?"

*「全身タイプの熊獣人とか普通に野生の熊と変わらないように見えるんだけど、獣人には何か違うモノが見えるの？」*

What?　Can't you see her boobs?　You're too perverted to show your bottom too. ......

*「は？　おめー、あのオッパイがみえねーの？　下も丸出しとかド変態すぎる女にゃよ……」*

&nbsp;

All I see is fur?

*毛皮しか見えんが？？*

After all, it seems that the beastman can see things that I cannot. No, it would be nice and fluffy if I buried my body in it. So does Mr. Masirow.

*やはり獣人には私には見えないものが見えているようである。いや、身体埋めたらモフモフで気持ちよさそうだけどね。マシロさんもそうだし。*
