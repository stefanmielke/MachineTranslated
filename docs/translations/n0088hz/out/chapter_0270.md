# To be honest, that idea is scary.

## ぶっちゃけその発想はこえーにゃ

&nbsp;

I suddenly thought of a way to pass the time.

*ふと暇つぶしを思いついた。*

&nbsp;

Well, you know those bandits, right?"

*「そういや盗賊っているじゃん？」*

You're here.

*「いるにゃね」*

That's the kind of thing you can kill, right?"

*「あれって殺していいやつじゃん？」*

Yes, she is.

*「そうにゃね」*

'So if we catch him, doesn't that mean he's an experimental subject that we can use for whatever we want?

*「じゃあ捕まえたとしたら、何に使ってもいい実験体ってことにならないかな？」*

...... I think it's fine because what you're saying isn't wrong and no one is going to get in trouble, but frankly, the idea is scary."

*「……言ってることは間違ってないし誰も困らないからいいんじゃねとは思うけど、ぶっちゃけその発想はこえーにゃ」*

&nbsp;

Good, if Misha says so, then there is no doubt about it.

*よっしゃ、ミーシャがそう言うなら間違いないだろう。*

So I decided to look for a bandit to get a 'person who can do anything' more than a slave.

*というわけで奴隷以上に『何してもいい人間』を手に入れるべく盗賊を探すことにした。*

&nbsp;

I'm going to do something that even Isiah can't do.

*「アイシアにもできない事をしちゃうぞぐへへ」*

"Oh my God, he's acting like he doesn't know which one of us is the bandit."

*「やべぇよコイツ、どっちが盗賊か分かんねぇ言動してんにゃ」*

&nbsp;

Well, what we do is experiment with magic and so on.

*まぁやるのは魔法の実験台とかなんだけど。*

But if possible, I wonder if there are any beautiful girl bandits or something. And I will search the streets from the sky.

*でもできれば美少女盗賊とか居ねぇかなー。と私は街道を空から探索していく。*

And, while in the room of the base, you just make a window and look through it. I thought it would be easy to find bandits.

*尚、拠点の部屋に居ながら窓を作って覗くだけ。盗賊なんて簡単に見つかるだろーって。*

&nbsp;

I'm not surprised ....... Someone who looks like that.

*……意外と居ねぇな。それっぽい奴。*

&nbsp;

Hey, Misha, I don't see anyone who looks like a bandit.

*「ねぇミーシャ、盗賊っぽい奴いないんだけど」*

The most important thing to remember is that you can't be a thief in the village without being attacked by demons, and thieves usually work as villagers. There are a lot of stories about thieves taking over entire villages, and they do it as a side job when they don't have to work in the field, you know?"

*「まー、そこらへんにいても魔物に襲われるだけだろうし、盗賊も普段は村人したりしてるからにゃ。村ごと盗賊って話も多くて、そういうのは野良仕事のない時に副業でやるってカンジにゃよ？」*

I'm not sure if he's a bandit or not if he's just a regular villager. I don't know if he's a bandit or not if he's just a regular villager."

*「まじかよ。普通に村人されてたら盗賊かどうか分からんのだけども」*

To tell the truth, you can't say you're a bandit until you've been attacked, and that's the trouble with bandits.

*「ぶっちゃけ襲われるまで盗賊とは言い切れないのが盗賊の厄介なトコにゃー」*

&nbsp;

It seems that there are a few guys who are running rampant in the so-called bandit-like fashion at .......

*……いわゆる盗賊団的に暴れまわってるような奴は少数らしい。*

And when those guys aren't banditry, they're also working for mercenaries or something like that. ......

*しかも、そういう奴らも盗賊をしていない時は傭兵とかで働いたりしているとか……*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Oh. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a new one.　We were drugged."

*「あ。そいやある意味鬼族の里の連中も盗賊にゃん？　私ら薬盛られたしにゃ」*

Hmmm. I guess you could say that. ......"

*「うーん。言われてみればそうだな……」*

&nbsp;

But I am not inclined to use the people of the demon village as experimental subjects of any kind.

*かといって今更鬼族の里の連中をなんかしらの実験体にしようとかいう気にはなれない。*

That thing is already in my storage. ......

*アレはもう私の収納に入ってるしなぁ……*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It would be a quicker story if we could somehow get the bandit ...... current, if he was around somewhere.

*どうにかして盗賊を……現行犯のヤツ、どっかにいれば話が早いんだけどなぁ。*

&nbsp;

I guess I'll just have to keep trying to find a street. ......?"

*「がんばって街道を探してみるしかないか……？」*

"Oh, oh, oh. I hope you'll help us maintain public order."

*「おーおー。治安維持に貢献するがいいにゃー」*

&nbsp;

It is also desirable to witness the moment of the attack by chance.

*それも、攻撃を仕掛けた瞬間を偶々目撃するのが望ましい。*

It is a wonderful world where no one (except the bandits) loses anything if the attack is prevented and only the experimental subjects are obtained before the victim is aware of anything.

*その攻撃を未然に防ぎ、被害者が何も気づかないウチに実験体だけゲットすれば（盗賊以外は）誰も損しない素敵な世界さ。*

&nbsp;

I mean, Karina. I thought you didn't like men.　I thought you said no men?

*「ってかカリーナ。おめー、男ダメなんじゃなかったっけ？　盗賊って大体男にゃよ？」*

You see, there's magic and stuff there, and you can have a female bandit, right ......?"

*「そこはほら、魔法とかあるし女盗賊もいけるでしょ……いるよね？」*

Even if there is, there will never be a beautiful girl like you. If you like a girl with a nice face, she's either a whore or a swindler in town.

*「いてもオメー好みの美少女とかは絶対いねーにゃ。そんな顔が良い奴は町で娼婦か詐欺師してるにゃよ」*

&nbsp;

Indeed!

*確かに！？*

&nbsp;

...... rapidly demotivated me."

*「……急激にやる気がそがれたわ」*

Ah, but there it is. "Ah, but you know what? There might be beautiful girls who are the daughters of bandits or slaves of bandits.

*「あー、でもホラ。あれにゃ。盗賊の娘とか、盗賊の奴隷とかに美少女いるかもにゃ」*

"Well, in detail."

*「ほう、詳しく」*

For example, a bandit attacks a nobleman's carriage.　If a beautiful young lady is caught, she will definitely be traced and cannot be sold. If they were to sell her, they would surely be traced back to her, so they would take her back to their hideout and turn her into an illegal slave ...... and eventually have a child ...... who is a beautiful girl like her mother....... What do you mean?"

*「例えば盗賊が貴族の馬車襲うにゃ？　美少女なお嬢様を捕まえたとするにゃ。売るにしても間違いなく足がついて売れないから、アジトに連れ帰って非合法な奴隷に……そしてそのうち子供も生まれ……母親似の美少女で……ってにゃ？」*

I'm motivated now, Misha!　Let's do our part to improve public safety!"

*「オッケーやる気出てきたよミーシャ！　ちょっと治安向上に一役買うとしますかぁ！」*

&nbsp;

Thus began my hunt for bandits.

*かくして、私の盗賊狩りが始まった。*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

...... Oh, don't tell Deere and the others!

*……あっ、ディア君達には内緒だかんね！*

&nbsp;
