# Pound it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-pong!

## 叩いてかぶってジャンケンポン！！

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

"Slap it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-paper!"

*「「叩いてかぶってジャンケンポン！！」」*

&nbsp;

The rock-paper-scissors game, played to a lively rhythm, was exactly the rule I knew, with the winner determined by guchokipa, the Japanese word for "rock-paper-scissors.

*その小気味よいリズムの掛け声で行われるジャンケンは、まさしく私の知っているルールそのもので、グーチョキパーで勝敗が決まるアレだった。*

Then a hemispherical helmet and a soft stick of rounded fur. If the winner hits the opponent in the head with the stick, he wins one game; if the loser can prevent it with the helmet, he is safe.

*その後、半球状の兜と丸めた毛皮の柔らかい棒。勝った方が棒で相手の頭を叩けば一勝、負けた方は兜で防げればセーフ。*

&nbsp;

It was a rule I knew perfectly well. Well, there are public bathhouses and such, so I'm not surprised now.

*完全に知ってるルールだった。まぁ銭湯とかあるし今更驚くこともないね。*

&nbsp;

"Then add undressing to that and you get ...... I see. ...... I see!"

*「そこに脱衣が加わると……なるほどね……なるほど！」*

&nbsp;

The two beautiful ladies are engaged in a fierce attack from the first round.

*二人の麗しい女性が、一回戦から激しい攻防を行っている。*

Both were human-like types of beastmen with little hair, with black panther and raccoon ears and tails.

*どちらも毛の少ない人に近いタイプの獣人で、黒豹とタヌキの耳と尻尾が生えていた。*

The two sisters were initially dressed in clothes with a good deal of ornamentation. Taking them off one by one was like the petals of a rose falling off one by one. The difference is that each time they take off their clothes, they become more sexy and attractive.

*二人のお姉さんは、最初はそれなりに装飾品の多い服を着ていた。それを脱がしあっていくのはあたかも薔薇の花びらが１枚１枚落ちていく様に似ている。違うのは、脱ぐたびに色気と魅力を増していく点か。*

&nbsp;

As for the offense and defense after the rock-paper-scissors, it is quite poor. They don't seem very motivated and even seem rather eager to take off.

*ジャンケンの後の攻防についてはかなりお粗末。あまりやる気がなさそうで、むしろ脱ぎたがっているようにすら感じる。*

With a bewitching smile, she takes off her jacket - but then peels off one of the lace decorations on her arms and drops it to the floor.

*妖艶な笑みを浮かべつつ、上着を脱ぐ――とみせかけて腕についたレースの布飾りを一枚剥ぎ、ポトリと床に落とす。*

&nbsp;

As one by one the clothes came off, the men in the audience's eyes bled and cheered.

*一枚、また一枚と服が脱げるたび、観客の男達の目は血走り、歓声が沸いた。*

&nbsp;

"Wow, isn't that soooo ...... erotic?"

*「うぉ、すっげ……エロくね？」*

Hey, hey, hey, Karina. Have you become afraid of me?　Is it too much for a country girl like you?"

*「おいおいカリーナ。怖気づいちまったかにゃぁ？　てめーみてーな田舎者の生娘にゃちぃっと荷が重いかにゃ？」*

"No, I'm not a daughter.　I have five wives."

*「いや私生娘じゃねぇよ？　妻も５人いるし」*

I'm thinking, "What about ......?　My wife?　And five ...... seriously?　You're good, aren't you? ......?"

*「……は？　妻？　しかも５人……マジ？　や、やるじゃん……？」*

&nbsp;

Oops, you're mysteriously upset, Misha. You're the one who's actually a live girl, aren't you?

*おっと、謎に動揺してるぞミーシャ。お前こそ実は生娘だな？*

Dia, on the other hand, was the one who reacted like a raw girl, eyes downcast in embarrassment.

*一方ディア君こそ生娘のような反応で、恥ずかしそうに目を伏せていた。*

&nbsp;

Dear, dear, dear, let's watch together!　Look, that black panther lady is about to put her hand on her underwear!　I'm gonna bare my pants!"

*「ディア君ディア君、一緒に見ようよ！　ほら、あの黒豹のお姉さんそろそろ下着に手をかけるよ！　もろ出ししちゃうよ！」*

What?　I, uh, well, you know!　I'm fine.

*「ひゃっ！？　や、あ、そのっ！　ぼ、ボクはいいですっ」*

"Oh, Karina!　Don't tease Dia!　She's a pure girl, unlike you!

*「カリーナぁ！　ディアちゃんをイジメんじゃねぇにゃ！　この子オマエと違って純真な女の子にゃよ！？」*

&nbsp;

And Misha hugs Dear to protect her from me.

*と、ミーシャが私から庇うようにディア君を抱きしめる。*

Well, Dia, you are so cute, I just couldn't resist. I mean, it was Misha who invited me to this convention.

*いやぁ、ディア君可愛くてつい。ってかこの大会誘ったのミーシャじゃん。*

&nbsp;

By the way, those two are professionals who are here to help make the tournament more exciting. They are the kind of people who would willingly participate in this tournament even if there is no prize money. It's good publicity for the store.

*「ちなみにあの二人は大会盛り上げのためのプロ枠にゃん。むしろ露出癖があるというか、賞金が無くても進んでこの大会に参加しちゃう系にゃね。お店の宣伝にもなるし」*

What's your name? Which store is she from?　Can you nominate her?"

*「へぇ。どこのお店の子？　指名できるの？」*

"Oh, hey. Are you actually a man?"

*「おめ、おい。実は男だったりする？」*

&nbsp;

I will. You've got that right.

*するよ。良く分かったな。*

&nbsp;

At that moment, there was a very loud cheer. The raccoon dog lady had taken off her bra. She lifted up her breasts with one arm, covering the tip with the other.

*その時、ひときわ大きい歓声が沸いた。タヌキのお姉さんがブラを脱いだのである。片腕で先端を隠しつつ、そのお胸をぷにゅっと持ち上げていた。*

&nbsp;

And this is where it was settled. Huh?　The raccoon sister surrendered, though she still had some bottom left and wasn't completely naked. The black panther sister accepted it and it was settled.

*と、ここで決着がついた。あれれ？　まだ下が残ってて完全に全裸にはなってないんだけど、タヌキのお姉さんが降参。黒豹のお姉さんがそれを認めての決着だった。*

The staff covers the raccoon dog sister with a blanket to hide her body.

*スタッフがタヌキお姉さんに毛布を被せて身体を隠す。*

&nbsp;

What is it? Can you surrender?"

*「あれ。降参ってできるの？」*

I'm not sure if it's okay if they approve of it. Well, you can go on, but I heard that this is rather more intriguing?"

*「相手が認めたらいいのにゃ。まぁ続けてもいいけど、このくらいの方がむしろそそるらしいにゃ？」*

&nbsp;

I see. That's a professional frame. If anyone wants to take off any more clothes, they should come to the store.

*なるほど。さすがプロ枠。これ以上脱がしたい人はお店に来てね、ということだ。*

&nbsp;

In the finals, I usually keep going until I'm completely naked!　Kukuk, can't wait to strip you down, can we?"

*「決勝では大抵全裸になるまで続けるけどにゃ！　ククク、てめぇをひん剥くのが楽しみだにゃぁ？」*

"Isn't Misha the one who's going to get ripped off?　That dress doesn't look like it has a lot of HP."

*「ひん剥かれるのミーシャじゃね？　その服、それほどHP多くなさそうだし」*

I have a secret plan!　I have a secret plan!"

*「ふふん！　私には秘策があるのにゃ！！」*

&nbsp;

And Misha is good at it. What kind of secret plan, what the hell kind of plan is that? ......

*と、得意げなミーシャ。秘策、一体どんな策なんだ……！*

&nbsp;

Nyan?　I mean, Dia-chan, if you take a closer look at your clothes, they don't have many parts, do they?　Here, I'll give you my secret recipe. You can put a lot of them on your thighs.

*「んにゃ？　つーかディアちゃん、その服よくよく見たら結構パーツ少なくないかにゃ？　ほれ、私の秘策のコレやるにゃ。太ももに一杯付けるといいにゃ」*

Uh, oh, thank you."

*「え、あ、ありがとうございます」*

&nbsp;

Misha hands over a mountain of garter rings to Dear-kun.

*と、どっさり山のようなガーターリングをディア君に渡すミーシャ。*

Sad news. Secret plan, not hidden.

*悲報。秘策、秘められてない。*

I mean, even if I give it to you, you're still going to face Misha in the second round, right?

*っていうか、それ渡しても二回戦でミーシャと当たるんだけどな？*

&nbsp;

"That's not fair.　Give me some of that."

*「ずるくね？　私にも頂戴よ」*

You're not going to do this to me, are you?

*「テメーにやるわけねーだろ！？」*

Oh?"　You sure?　Even if I lose before we get to the finals."

*「お？　いいのか？　決勝行くまでに私が負けても」*

"I'll lend you ...... and you'll win for sure!　You better pay me back before the final!"

*「……貸してやるから絶対勝てにゃ！？　決勝前には返せよ！？」*

&nbsp;

What, you're lending it to me? You're a real sweetheart, you know that?

*なんだよ貸してくれんのかよ、マジ優しいなお前。*
