# This guy is a convict.

## 確信犯かコイツ

&nbsp;

We slipped through the wards and were transported to a building that looked like the main hall of a shrine.

*結界をすり抜けた私達は、神社の本殿のような建物に運ばれた。*

&nbsp;

"Is it safe to say that we've made it this far at ......, is that correct?"

*「ここまでくれば一安心……で、いいんでしょうか？」*

Maybe. But if you're dealing with that Tenshiki, he must be persistent."

*「かもね。でもあのテンシキが相手なら、しつこいはずだよ」*

&nbsp;

While Yohki and the maid of honor talked like that, we were laid out on futons on the tatami mats.

*ヨウキと侍女がそう話しつつ、私達は畳の上のお布団に寝かされた。*

...... Should I get up soon?

*……そろそろ起きた方が良いかな？*

Chillax ...... Oh, I made eye contact with the lady's maid.

*チラッ……あ、女中さんと目が合っちゃった。*

&nbsp;

...... Um, you're awake, right?"

*「……あの、起きてますよね？」*

"Hmm?　Did they know?"

*「むっ？　バレてた？」*

Yeah, well, it was easy to transport. ......

*「ええまぁその、運びやすかったので……」*

&nbsp;

They say it's more difficult to carry if you're a serious sleeper. ...... It's no use if you're exposed. I sit up.

*本気で寝てる人間なら、もっと運びにくいらしい……バレてちゃぁ仕方ない。私は体を起こす。*

&nbsp;

I felt like I was drugged when I looked at them all, so I figured I should just go back to sleep."

*「なんかこう、みんな見ると薬盛られてた感じがしたから寝てた方が良いのかと」*

'I am sorry, it was our fault. We would be happy to explain the situation to you at ......, Mr. Yohki."

*「申し訳ありません、我々の不手際です。……ヨウキ様、事情を説明した方が良いと思われますが」*

U, ha, yes. ......

*「う、は、はい……」*

&nbsp;

Yoki sits upright on the tatami mats.

*ヨウキちゃんが畳の上に正座する。*

&nbsp;

In fact, there is a faction that claims that sacrificing people from the village is outrageous and that we should just kidnap people or something. ......The head of this faction is my uncle.

*「実は、村の人間を生贄に捧げるなんてとんでもない、人を攫ってくるなりすればいいだろ、とかいう主張をしている一派がおりまして……その頭目が叔父です」*

...... are you crazy enough to let someone like that handle your breakfast?"

*「……そんなのに朝食任せたとか頭大丈夫？」*

I was so blatant that I thought he would do something about it. Well, it was so blatant that I thought he would do something. ...... Then, even though he is my uncle, he would be able to punish my father without mercy, wouldn't he?　If I could drain the pus out of the village with just a little scolding, that would be fine."

*「あ、そこも聞いてらしたんですね。いやぁ、あまりに露骨だったので何かしでかすと思いまして……そうすれば叔父といえど父も容赦なく罰せるでしょう？　私が多少叱られる程度で里の膿をだせるならそれでいいかと」*

&nbsp;

Hey, this guy is a convict.

*おい、確信犯かコイツ。*

&nbsp;

You mean to say that the uncle drugged our princess to sacrifice her?"

*「つまり、その叔父はうちのお姫様を生贄にするために眠り薬を盛ったってこと？」*

"...... it will be."

*「……そうなります」*

OK, I get it. That's unforgivable. Let's feed it to the dragons."

*「ＯＫ、把握した。めちゃ許せんな。ドラゴンに食わすか」*

&nbsp;

I'll certify that uncle as my enemy.

*その叔父、私の敵認定しとくわ。*

&nbsp;

I didn't think sleeping pills would work on Master Dragon either, though."

*「それにしてもドラゴン様にも眠り薬が効くとは思いませんでしたが」*

Well, I was trying to keep my body small, maybe that's why.

*「まぁ身体小さくしてたし、それでかもね」*

'...... I pretended to be asleep too, right? I was surprised when I was picked up by the ...... scales, though I yawned a little. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep this up.

*『……いや自分も寝たふりっすよ？……あくびはちょっと出たっすけど……鱗毟られたのはびっくりしたっす。でもまぁいつものことなんで』*

&nbsp;

Oh, that's right. And Arthur, who is still pretending to be asleep, says in his sleep. It is a sleep talk that only I can understand because it is in dragon language.

*あ、そうだったんだ。と、まだ寝たフリしてるアーサーが寝言風に言う。ドラゴン語なので私にしか通じない寝言だ。*

You're doing a great job, Arthur. I was totally fooled too, you should have told me.

*やるじゃんアーサー。私もすっかり騙されてたよ、言ってくれればいいのに。*

&nbsp;

In the meantime, is it safe here?"

*「とりあえず、ここは安全なの？」*

There is a ward against men entering here. Originally, only pure maidens and the women in their service were allowed here.

*「ここには男が入ってこられない結界があります。本来ここは清らかな乙女と、その世話をする側仕えの女性だけが入れるのです」*

Yeah, so is it safe here?"

*「うん、それでここは安全なの？」*

I can't say it's completely safe because some of my uncle's clique are women."

*「……叔父の一派には女性もいるので、完全に安全とは言い切れません」*

&nbsp;

Right?

*ですよねー。*

&nbsp;

I'm sure we'll protect our princess. That being said, I'd like to talk to the dragon as soon as possible, but where are the dragons?"

*「まぁうちのお姫様は私達が守るから。それはそうと、さっさとドラゴンと話付けたいんだけどドラゴンはどこにいるの？」*

"...... Uh, we're in the mountains up ahead. Over there."

*「……ええと、この先の山にいます。あちらです」*

&nbsp;

Yuki points to a forest and a mountain. To begin with, this is a hidden village in the mountains. ...... Hmmm... That way.

*ヨウキちゃんが指さす先には森と山がある。そもそもここは山中にある隠れ里なわけだが……ふむふむ。あっちね。*

&nbsp;

I see. I'll be right back.　I'll be right back."

*「そっかそっか。じゃあ私ちょっと下見に行ってきていいかな？　すぐ帰ってくるからさ」*

What?　Uh, yes."

*「え？　あ、はい」*

&nbsp;

Let's get this over with before Mr. Dear wakes up. That way, I can relax and let my uncle and the others ruin the place!

*ディア君が起きる前に、さっさと済ませておこうかな。その方がのんびり叔父とやらを破滅させられるっしょ！*

I'm going to make you regret messing around with Deere!

*ディア君に手ぇ出した事、後悔させてやんよぉ！！*
