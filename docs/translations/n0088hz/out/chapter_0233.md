# Declaration of Victory

## 勝利宣言

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was the fiercest battle ever fought.

*かつてない激しい戦いだった。*

Finals. The winner - it was me!

*決勝戦。勝利を手にしたのは――私だった！！*

&nbsp;

Ha, ha ...... that was a bad ......!"

*「はぁ、はぁ……あぶなかった……ッ！」*

If only it had been banned for one more battle earlier, you'd be wearing a helmet with magic. ......

*「ぐぬぅぅぅ、テメーが魔法で兜被るの、もう１戦分早く禁止されていれば……ッ」*

Well, I still had the ring on my arm, so I was the winner.

*「まぁそれでも腕にリング残ってたから、勝敗的には私の方が勝ってたよ」*

&nbsp;

The rules were changed to a regular game of "tapping, covering, and rock-paper-scissors" after various prohibitions were added.

*尚、ルールは色々禁止が追加されて最終的には普通の叩いてかぶってジャンケンポンの勝負になっていた。*

&nbsp;

I've seen judges who can see through the audience to block ...... Misha's post-movement. I can't use magic in secret either, can I?　I used to use it until they added a rule banning it.

*……ミーシャの後だしを封じるために観客からそれを見切れる審判が出てきたりすんだもんよ。私だってこっそり魔法使うわけにはいかねぇじゃんよ？　ルール追加で禁止されるまでは使ってたけど。*

(And the additional referee was a passing, masked General Garou. Are you busy?)

*（尚、追加の審判は通りすがりの覆面を被ったガロウ将軍だった。暇なの？）*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Misha hides his crotch with his tail, his chest with his left arm, and takes off his pantyhose, the last one, and offers it to me.

*股間を尻尾で隠し、胸を左腕で隠し、最後の一枚、パンストを脱いで私に献上するミーシャ。*

In contrast, I, too, cover my breasts with my hair, leave one pannier with no panties, and receive a pair of hovering pantyhose with my right hand while hiding my buttocks with my left hand.

*対する私も、髪で胸を隠し、ノーパンでパニエ１枚を残し、左手では尻のラインを隠しつつ右手でホカホカのパンストを受け取る。*

&nbsp;

"I got it!!! ！！！！！"

*「とったどーーーーーーーーーーーーー！！！！！」*

&nbsp;

He held up his pantyhose and declared victory.

*パンストを掲げ、勝利宣言。*

&nbsp;

The winner is Carina!　A big round of applause to both players for an unprecedentedly hot competition!　Now where else can I nominate you?"

*「優勝は、カリーナ選手だぁあああーーーーーーーー！！！　かつてない熱い戦いを繰り広げた両選手に、盛大な拍手を！！　あとどこのお店にいけば指名できますか？」*

'It's not for sale!　Too bad!!!!"

*「非売品です！！！　残念だったな！！！」*

I'm so sorry!　Such an outrage!"

*「ええー！　そんなご無体な！！」*

&nbsp;

I picked up my own clothes, which I had taken off, held them in my arms, and hurriedly returned to the players' seats.

*私は脱ぎ捨てた自分の服を拾って抱え、そそくさと選手席へ戻っていった。*

&nbsp;

Deere, you won!"

*「ディア君、勝ったよ！！」*

I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get dressed soon!　Clothes!

*「お、おめで、とう、ございます……あ、そ、そのっ、早く着てくださいっ！　服っ！」*

Oops, sorry, sorry.

*「おっと、ゴメンゴメン」*

&nbsp;

Dia-kun's face turns bright red and gasps. He is not looking ...... through the gap between his fingers while hiding his face with his hand!　What the hell!　I'd definitely be looking at that stew!

*顔を真っ赤にしてあわあわするディア君。手で顔を隠しつつ指の隙間から……見てない！　なんだと！？　私なら絶対見てるシチュだぞ！？*

&nbsp;

And then, I put my clothes back on.

*と、服を着なおす。*

&nbsp;

...... Um, now that the convention is over, can I put my clothes on too?　I can't wear it alone."

*「……あの、大会も終わったしボクの服も着せてもらっていいですか？　一人だと着れなくて」*

I mean, you're really faithful to take off your clothes until the end of the tournament. I mean, you're really sincere about taking off the law until the tournament is over."

*「あ、そうだね。ていうか大会終わるまで律儀に脱いでるとかほんと誠実だなぁ」*

Because that was the rule. ......

*「だって、そういうルールでしたし……」*

&nbsp;

With a snap of his fingers, Dear-kun returned to his gothic lolita dress.

*パチンと指を鳴らせば、ディア君もゴスロリドレス姿に戻った。*

You're relieved that you're ...... phew, but do you realize that you're dressed up in a cute little girl's outfit?　You are already a girl. ......

*……ふぅ、とホッとしてるけど、可愛く着飾った女装姿だってちゃんとわかってんのかな？　もうすっかり女の子だね……！*

&nbsp;

Now that I got the fight money, I think I'll buy some accessories for Mr. Dear. ...... No, I think I'll buy some gems that could be used as materials and have them processed by all the Five Elders.

*ファイトマネーももらえたし、ディア君のアクセサリーでも買おうかな……いや、素材になりそうな宝石を買って五大老のみんなに加工してもらうのがいいかな？*

I'll pay the actual cost of the labor, and I'll pay for the technical fee on the bed!

*工賃は実費で、技術料分はベッドで払うぜ！*

&nbsp;

"Unyaaaaa...... can't be a bride anymore!　It's your fault, Carina!

*「うにゃぁあああ……もうお嫁にいけないにゃぁ！！　てめーのせいにゃよカリーナ！」*

What? You invited Misha to the convention. You deserved it, didn't you?"

*「えっ、大会誘ってきたのミーシャじゃん。自業自得じゃね？」*

I wish you had just lost!　I didn't want to fight, I just wanted revenge on you!

*「おめーが大人しく負けてればよかったのにゃ！　私は戦いがしたかったんじゃねぇ、おめーに復讐したかっただけなのにゃあああ！！」*

&nbsp;

Well, this time I was embarrassed enough, and I think I got my proper revenge for that.

*まぁ今回は私も十分恥ずかしい思いしたし、それはちゃんと復讐できたんじゃないかな。*

&nbsp;

'Oh, Karina. Delivery, delivery!　And bring Misha with you!　I need to check something.

*『あ、カリーナちゃん。納品、納品！　それとミーシャちゃんも連れてきてね！　ちょっと調べたいことがあるので』*

&nbsp;

What? What is it that you want to check out ...... Eh?　What is it that you want to find out? ......

*えっ？……え？　調べたいことって何だろう……*

&nbsp;

"...... Uh, you know. Misha, can you come over for a minute so we can talk?"

*「……あー、その。ミーシャ、話があるからちょっと来てくれる？」*

"Well, I don't like it."

*「えー、なんか嫌にゃんだけど」*

"Well, I got a reminder from a source I can't refuse: ...... or is it an oracle ......?"

*「その、断れない筋から念話が届いた……いや、神託……っての？」*

What about "......?　Don't make jokes. If you cheat God, you will be punished by God.　I heard that recently a country was destroyed because of it.

*「……は？？？　え、冗談やめろにゃ。神様騙ったら神罰おきるにゃよ？　なんか最近それで国が滅んだらしいにゃよ？」*

&nbsp;

Don't worry, don't worry, we are the real deal.

*大丈夫大丈夫、ウチは本物だから。*
