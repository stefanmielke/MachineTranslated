# Gee!　They know!

<blank>

<blank>

Okay. Let's discuss this in secret, hiding our true identities!

<blank>

So I will hide my face with a mask, greet them politely as a passing suspicious person, ask them what I want to ask them while they look at me warily and distantly, and then go home quickly in style.

<blank>

I, Karina-chan!　I put on a mask, so now I am Carina the Phantom Thief!　Here I come!

...... optical camouflage removal!

<blank>

Excuse me, madam. May I have a moment of your time?"

"Hmm? ...... What is it, Anta, how did you get in here?"

A little bit of magic. Oh, I have no intention of harming you at the moment, so please rest assured."

<blank>

She bows a theatrical bow. The Obachans quickly stand in front of Grandma Maria, and she takes a stance. Oh, she's going to do it, isn't she? It's the right position for an escort.

<blank>

'Actually, the other day, an elf boy asked me to help his sister who was captured by pirates. I questioned the pirate, and he said she was a pet of his lord, and I was wondering if you knew anything about that."

Elf......Ah, that's the girl. Then don't worry, she's on her way to the country right now."

Oh, really?"

The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have enough money to pay your visit to the pirates. I don't want to go to war with the elves. ...... I mean, were you the wizard who destroyed the pirates, Kali?

<blank>

Geez!　They know!

<blank>

What are you talking about, Maria? I am not such a beautiful girl, am I?"

We've seen you naked, we can tell even if you hide your face with a mask like that. Don't you dare to mock the former wife of the lord, Kali. At least put on a better mask.

Kuku, that's, uh, that's, uh. Yes."

<blank>

Old Maria shrugged her shoulders and said, "Oh dear. I recognized her immediately as Grandma Maria. I mean, she's the former wife of a former lord. That would be a blessing for raising children.

<blank>

I'm being asked to find and return an elf boy over here. Then the pirates tried to attack a merchant ship with a permit and the wizards got them, or they sank the ship, or they don't know because the wizards took all their cargo. ......

'Uh, yeah, well, I'm taking your luggage. With the elf boy."

I'm glad you're here. You're not being treated badly with Kali, are you?"

<blank>

Yeah, well, I'm about dressed like a girl.

<blank>

Gomez had been doing too much for too long, and it was time to get rid of him. I didn't think he'd mess with the elves at the last minute. Kari saved me the trouble. I'll leave the punishment to my son, but at the very least, he'll be sent to the mine."

"Oh, yeah?　I thought since you're connected to the lord, you'd be released immediately or something."

I didn't raise him that way. If you do, I'll kick your ass and send your son to the mines!"

<blank>

Even without my help, Gomez was already too late, apparently.

Old Maria laughs boldly. If Old Maria says so, I guess so!

<blank>

But, Grandma Maria, why did you leave Dia - the elf boy - behind? Why did you, Dia--why did you leave the elf boy behind and go ahead with your sister?"

...... Well, Kari, that's a big deal, isn't it? It's a big deal to have all your stuff just vanish into thin air, isn't it?　There was no way to find them quickly, and our first priority was to return the elf girl safely.

<blank>

The fault, it seems, lies with Verardo, since Gomez and his team had gone outside their original defensive area to pirate in the first place.

<blank>

'I'll fly the bird right out and have them call you back. If you had come yesterday, I would still be here. When my ...... sister gets here, will you give me back the Dear?"

Okay, I'll take care of it until then."

I'm grateful for your help. I couldn't take care of it because of what happened.

<blank>

Old Maria shrugs her shoulders and says, "Oh dear.

<blank>

...... Oh, and about that sacred weapon, Poseidon, that Kari destroyed."

I'm sorry!　I can't return that, okay?"

I'll get by without it. I'll just give up and pretend I've incurred the wrath of God."

<blank>

He backs down easily. I wonder if it's okay.

<blank>

We don't want a repeat of the Alchemy Kingdom."

I said, "Oh, you have that information? Is that information in there?"

Of course I do. Who do you think I am?"

"I wonder if it was an old lady I met in a public bathhouse who seemed to have good luck with children and child-rearing."

No doubt.

<blank>

Kukuku," laughs Old Maria.

<blank>

I'm glad that Grandma Maria is rounding things out."

That's what a family of lords does. The first thing to do is to get a good look at the newest version of the game. It's not like our soldiers are going to catch him no matter what we do.

She said, "Wow, thanks, Grandma Maria. Do you want to rub my tits?"

I'll see you in the bathroom. They're working right now."

<blank>

The situation was thus settled peacefully.
