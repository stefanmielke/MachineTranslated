# Geh!? You're onto me!?

<b>

<b>

Alright. Let's consult while secretly hiding my identity!

<b>

So, I’ll hide my face with a mask, greet politely as a suspicious passerby, ask what I want while being watched cautiously from a distance, and then quickly leave.

<b>

I am Karina-chan! Now that I’m wearing a mask, I am the Phantom Thief Karina! Here I come!

…Optical camouflage disengaged!

<b>

“Excuse me, madam. May I have a moment of your time?”

“Hm?…What’s up with you? How did you get in here?”

“Just a bit of magic. Ah, I have no intention of causing harm at the moment, so please rest assured.”

<b>

I bow slightly, like in a play. The aunties stand in front of Maria-baa, ready for action. Oh, they’re serious. That’s the right position for a guard.

<b>

“Actually, the other day, an elf boy asked me to help rescue his sister who was captured by pirates. When I questioned the pirates, they said she’s become the lord’s pet, so I was wondering if you knew anything.”

“An elf… Oh, that kid? Then don’t worry, she’s probably being transported back to her homeland right now.”

“Really? Is that so?”

“It’s an international issue, you know. They’ve given her a generous compensation as well. There’s no way we’re going to start a war with the elves… By the way, you were the one who wiped out the pirates, weren’t you, Karichan?”

<b>

Geh!? You’re onto me!?

<b>

“W-What do you mean, Maria-sama? I’m not that kind of beautiful girl!”

“I’ve seen you naked, so even if you hide your face with that mask, I can tell. Don’t underestimate the former lord’s wife, Karichan. At least wear a better mask.”

“Ugh, well, um, okay.”

<b>

Maria-baa shrugs her shoulders. Indeed, I recognized her immediately, and it seems Maria-baa is the former lord’s wife. No wonder she seems to have the benefits of raising children.

<b>

“I’ve been asked to find the elf boy and return him as well. Then the pirates tried to attack a merchant ship with permission and got taken down by a wizard, or the ship was sunk, or they lost all their cargo to the wizard, so I don’t know…”

“Ah, yeah, um, I’m holding onto the cargo. Along with the elf boy.”

“Then that’s good. If he’s with you, he shouldn’t be in any danger, right?”

<b>

Well, he’s just dressed as a girl, that’s all.

<b>

“Gomez has already done too much, so it was about time for him to be dealt with. I never expected him to go after an elf in the end. Thanks to you, Karichan, I’ve been spared the trouble. …Well, the punishment will be left to my son, but at the very least, he’ll be sent to the mines.”

“Oh, is that so? I thought he’d be released immediately since he’s connected to the lord.”

“Haha, I didn’t raise him to be that soft. If I did something like that, I’d kick him in the butt and send him to the mines instead!”

<b>

It seems that even without my intervention, Gomez was already beyond saving.

Maria-baa laughs heartily. If she says so, then it must be true!

<b>

“But Maria-baa, why did you leave Dia-kun—the elf boy—behind and bring just the sister first?”

“...Well, Karichan. It’s a big deal if all the cargo suddenly disappears, right? There was no guarantee it would be found quickly, so the first priority was to safely return that elf girl.”

<b>

After all, it seems Gomez and his crew were operating outside their original jurisdiction, so the fault lies with Verald.

<b>

“I’ll send a bird to call them back immediately. If they had come yesterday, they would still be here. …When the sister arrives, will you return Dia-kun?”

“Okay, then I’ll keep him safe until then.”

“Thank you. Given the circumstances, I couldn’t treat it as a big deal.”

<b>

Maria-baa shrugs her shoulders.

<b>

“...Ah, and about the divine artifact ‘Poseidon’ that you destroyed, Karichan.”

“Oh, um, I’m sorry! I can’t return that, but is that okay?”

“Well, we can manage without it. I’ll just have to give up and think of it as having incurred the wrath of the gods.”

<b>

She backs down easily. Is that really okay?

<b>

“I don’t want a repeat of the Alchemy Kingdom’s situation.”

“Oh. You’ve heard about that?”

“Of course. Who do you think I am?”

“Just a grandma who seems to have blessings for childbirth and child-rearing that I met at the public bath.”

“No doubt about it.”

<b>

Hehehe, Maria-baa laughs.

<b>

“Thanks to you, it seems everything will work out smoothly.”

“That’s the job of the lord’s family. Well, I’ll overlook your robbery and illegal entry, Karichan. …Our soldiers wouldn’t be able to catch you no matter what.”

“Yay, thank you, Maria-baa. Want to grope my breasts?”

“Let’s save that for the bath. Right now, these kids are working.”

<b>

Thus, the situation was peacefully resolved.
