# True Chaos God

<b>

The True Chaos God. The one I finally found said he wanted to switch sides.

<b>

"So, are you a boy who identifies as a girl, or a cross-dressing boy? Confess which one you are."

"…I thought you would ask about something else… Well, I guess that's an important point too. I am—right now, my body is female, but inside, I am male."

"Oh…?"

"It is said that having a different gender and body makes it easier to use the alchemy that belongs to chaos, but I don't know if that's true. In any case, I was male in my previous life."

<b>

What!? This guy is the same TS as me…!

<b>

"Then it's fine to say you're a girl."

"Yeah. Regardless of my soul, it's undeniable that my body is female. And I want to enter the women's bath, so please consider me as a girl."

"…That's naive. There's not much dream in the women's bath… it's mostly old ladies."

"What!?… Then please go in with me to confirm that."

"I guess I have no choice; if the opportunity arises, I'll go in with you."

<b>

Saying that, this guy and I looked at each other's bodies as if we were licking them.

What is it? We really get along…! If we had met in Japan, we might have become best friends…

<b>

"Oh. But there's that. I have to report the one who calls himself the True Chaos God to the gods. Otherwise, this country will perish again."

"…About that, I have actually never called myself the True Chaos God. The homunculus maid—she's the one who has been saying that on her own."

<b>

The True Chaos God… no, the so-called True Chaos God let out a big sigh as he said that.

<b>

"Huh? So, does that mean the one behind you is the mastermind of the 'True Chaos God'? If that's the case, then indeed, the story changes."

"Right. Is there any way you can help me?"

"Well, I can't say anything until I ask the gods…"

<b>

Considering the level of blasphemy against the name of the Chaos God, the one who is 'being forced to take that name' is less malicious than the 'mastermind who is making them take that name.'

If the cause is not removed, many 'Chaos God wannabes' will be born in the future. Thinking about that, the real target is… the mastermind!

<b>

The gods will surely, probably, definitely say so!

The only concern is if they won't forgive even someone who was just made to take the name. Given that particular god, it's possible, which is troubling.

<b>

"…I need to improve my standing with the gods."

"Alright, I will actively cooperate with whatever I can do."

"Then here's my advice. Keep your socks on and warm them up."

"? Why?"

<b>

The blonde beauty tilted her head. If I didn't know either, I would have reacted the same way.

<b>

"Nyaa nyaa. So, where is that maid who's keeping watch?"

"Let me answer you, Miss Cat. I can't bring her to a place where we're discussing switching sides, so she's waiting in the dungeon's bedroom."

"Oh, you have quite the taste. She's a good match for Karina."

"Don't say that, Misha. …By the way, why the bedroom?"

"…A healthy-minded man wouldn't be able to resist the advances of a sexy maid. No, it's definitely some kind of honey trap. There's no way to escape."

<b>

That's true. I nodded in agreement.

<b>

"Wait, no, that's not it. Does the dungeon really have a bedroom?"

"There's no way it wouldn't have one. An artificial dungeon is a place where you can barricade yourself and fight in case of emergencies. In other words, it's a shelter, right? There should at least be a resting place."

"Now that you mention it, that's true."

<b>

And I ordered the maid to warm the bed, and it seems I could come to this room alone for a coffee break.

<b>

"First, we need to restrain that homunculus maid. Let's make her spill the beans about the mastermind."

"Can you do it? She's pretty strong. Stronger than a modified lizardman."

"I can do it. I'm super strong, so leave it to me."

<b>

I replied with a bright smile. …Ah, but if this room has measures to obstruct spatial magic like this one, it might be a bit tough…?
