# True God of Chaos

<blank>

A true god of chaos. Finally, we found him and he said he wanted to turn over to us.

<blank>

'So, are you a bastard or a transvestite? Which is it, come clean."

"I thought you were going to ask me more about ...... something else. ...... Well, that's the important part, too. I'm--I'm a woman in body now, but I'm a man inside."

"How about ......?"

He said, "According to him, it is easier to use alchemy that belongs to chaos if the gender and body are different, but I don't know if it is true or not. Anyway, I was a man in my previous life."

<blank>

What. This guy is from the same TS as me. ......

<blank>

Then I guess that means it's a girl."

Oh. I'm sure that my body is a woman, if not my soul. And I want to take a bath in a woman's bath, so I'll take a woman's bath, please."

"You're ...... naive. There's not so much dreaming in the women's baths, ...... they're all old ladies."

What? ...... then come in with me to check it out, please."

'No choice, I'll go in with you when I get a chance.'

<blank>

Then this guy and I looked at each other's bodies as if we were licking each other.

I don't know, I really like this guy. ......　If we had met in Japan, we might have become best friends. ......

<blank>

Oh, but it's that thing. But that's the thing. We have to turn in to God the one who calls himself the true god of chaos. Otherwise, this country will perish again."

"...... That's the thing, I've never actually called myself a true God of Chaos, not once. The homunculus maid--surveillance on me says so on its own."

<blank>

The true god of chaos ...... no other name, the true god of chaos, sighed loudly as he said this.

<blank>

Huh?　Does that mean that the guy behind you is the mastermind behind the 'true god of chaos'?　That would certainly change the story.

I know. Can you help me somehow?"

Hmmm, hard to say without asking God. ......

<blank>

In terms of the degree of blasphemy against the name "God of Chaos," the "mastermind who allows him to call himself so" is more vicious and vicious than "the one who is allowed to call himself so without permission.

If the cause is not removed, any number of "chaos god mods" will be born in the future. With that in mind, the real target is the ...... mastermind!

<blank>

God must, perhaps, perhaps, perhaps, say so!

The only concern would be if God did not allow it, even if he was just given the name. With that God, it's possible, and that's troubling.

<blank>

......I'll have to do better on God's good intentions."

'Okay, I'm willing to help in any way I can.

Then here's my advice. Keep your socks on and keep them warm."

?"　Why?"

<blank>

A beautiful blonde girl who turns her head. I would have too if I didn't know.

<blank>

Nyah nyah. Where is this maid called "watchdog"?"

'To answer your question, cat lady. You're right, I can't bring you to the place where we're going to discuss turning in, so I'm keeping you in the bedroom in the dungeon."

"Well, you're my favorite. You're a good match for Karina."

Don't say it, Misha. ...... I mean, why the bedroom?"

...... How can a man with a healthy male psyche not have a physical relationship with a naughty maid who pesters him around? No, it's definitely some kind of honeymoon. And there's no escaping it."

<blank>

It is. I nodded in agreement.

<blank>

I mean, no. You have a bedroom in your dungeon?"

Artificial dungeons are places where people can stay and fight in case of emergencies. A man-made dungeon is a shelter, you know?　There's at least a place to rest.

If you ask me, it's true."

<blank>

He then ordered the maid to keep the bed warm, and he was able to get out to this room alone about time to take a coffee break.

<blank>

First, let's take that homunculus maid into custody. Let's get her to tell us about the mastermind."

Can you do it?"　It's pretty strong. Not even close to a modified Lizardman."

I can do it. I'm very strong. Leave it to me."

<blank>

I replied with a smile. ......Ah, but it might be a little harder if the room is countermeasure to inhibit space magic like this room ......?
