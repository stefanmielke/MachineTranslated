# Safe, Safe

(If we consider one episode as the amount that can be updated daily, there's a theory that it can be updated daily)

I’m Karina-chan. I replicated the clothes I received from the god (initial equipment).

Replicating clothes... it's not a joke!

<b>

<b>

Huh? Replicating items for sale is a last resort?

<b>

This is for personal use, so it's safe! Besides, I'm the type of person who wants to collect all the items available in the game.

Since there's a storage space like a "bag" that can hold infinite items in the game, selling the initial equipment made by the god is just unthinkable!

<b>

Well, I wasn't trying to sell it; I was stripped of it, so it's safe.

What I said while drunk, I don't know. I have no memory of it. Seriously.

<b>

...Oops, I'm feeling a bit dizzy.

As the god said, replicating seems to use quite a bit of MP.

<b>

"Thank you very much. I've said my goodbyes."

"Mm."

<b>

I return the replicated clothes to Harumikazuchi.

Harumikazuchi takes the pipe from her mouth and exhales smoke sideways.

<b>

"…If it's that important to you, I could hold onto it instead of selling it, you know?"

<b>

How kind. Is this my first partner or a god?

No, I’m grateful to the god.

<b>

"Oh, no need to worry. Actually, I have several of the same thing."

"Oh, is that so? Then I won't hold back and will sell it. Well, it seems good for me to use too."

<b>

I answered that way as an excuse in case I met her again wearing the same clothes.

<b>

"Um, Harumikazuchi-san. Can I come again?"

"We're in the customer business, so I don't mind, but isn't it a bit too much for a newcomer?"

<b>

Ugh! It's true that it's a shop where a C-rank adventurer like Blade would become a regular.

Moreover, it's a shop for various questionable entertainment, so the prices are understandably high.

I need to become a merchant and start earning money soon...

<b>

"And if you're after my body... well, you flirted with me amusingly yesterday, and I ended up enjoying it, but next time, I’ll charge you? Even if you're a woman."

"Uh, um... by the way, how much?"

"Well, it depends on my mood... it might be 100 gold coins. I'm originally not for sale."

<b>

Harumikazuchi chuckles and tickles my chin with her left hand, causing my body to react.

My heart feels tight and fluttery... Ugh, how did I manage to flirt with this older sister yesterday!?

<b>

<b>

"Ouch, ouch... Hah!"

"Oh, did you wake up, senpai?"

"Y-yeah..."

<b>

Blade wakes up and sits up. He's only in his underwear.

Wait, looking closely, he has quite a bit of muscle; as expected of an adventurer and a front-line job.

<b>

"Huh, why am I naked? Oh, big sis."

"Honestly, you showed a pitiful sight to a newcomer, Blade."

"Oh, uh..."

<b>

Blade looks at me with a somewhat embarrassed expression.

<b>

"Uh... Can I ask for it on credit? At least for the equipment."

"Hmph, since you paid me once yesterday, I'll let it slide. Just earn some more, okay?"

"I owe you one!"

<b>

As if used to it, Harumikazuchi tosses the equipment and an empty wallet beside Blade.

<b>

"Listen, Karina. You have to secure your equipment even if you have to bow your head. This is an important piece of advice from your senpai."

"(It’s quite pitiful, but) understood."

"…By the way, huh? Big sis, I don't have my sword?"

<b>

While putting on clothes and checking the returned equipment, Blade says.

To that, Harumikazuchi replies while puffing on her pipe, "That's only natural."

<b>

"There were a few extra for this girl. If you pay me 5 large copper coins as a deposit, I'll return it. Go hunt some slimes or something; you're good at that, right?"

<b>

And take care of the girl too. Harumikazuchi laughs while puffing on her pipe.

I want to fluff her fluffy tail, oh older sister.

<b>

"…After this, we're going to the materials storage. I'll show you my woodworking skill."

"Got it, I'll learn from you."

<b>

Um, I guess I'll be in your care?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Oh. By the way, diseases and contraception can be managed with magic or potions, and it seems that there are specialized magical tools in such shops that ensure everything is absolutely safe. (Excerpt from basic knowledge)

Amazing, another world!

<b>

With Blade's woodworking skill, we prepared simple equipment and headed to the forest outside the town for slime hunting.

<b>

"For slime hunting, it's better to have scrap equipment. Considering that, it's a pretty good job for newcomers, though there's some danger."

<b>

After hunting slimes, it seems you have to take good care of the equipment, or it will become unusable. If it's disposable simple equipment, you can just toss it away.

<b>

"Don't space out, Karina. This area doesn't have much other than slimes, but it's an area where a lot of slimes appear. If you get surrounded by three or more, you have to dash away or you'll die."

"Got it! I'll be careful!"

"Good response. You'll become a good adventurer."

<b>

Is it his habit to compliment me like that, Blade-senpai?

<b>

"And don't try to imitate what I'm about to do too much. It's better if you can, but for newcomers, just break the core and take it down."

"What are you planning to do?"

"Well, just as I thought, here they come."

<b>

A wild slime appears right in front of us. It's a round water dumpling about the size of a tree stump. Inside it, a round core floats.

<b>

Blade aims for that core with a piece of scrap wood from the simple equipment and thrusts it.

The piece of wood plunges into the slime's body—just before hitting the core, it briefly slows down and then accelerates again, piercing through—an unscathed core is pushed out from the slime's body and rolls away.

<b>

"Whoa!"

"That's about it. Just remember, if you leave it like this, it will turn back into a slime, so you have to deliver it by the end of the day after hunting."

<b>

An unscathed core seems to fetch a higher price. Even a broken core can be used as material or nutrients for scavenger slimes, so they buy it for a decent price.

<b>

...If it's space magic, I could pull it out easily.

No, if I disguise it as wind magic, it might be better to blow away the surrounding squishy parts instead.

<b>

"Can I try using magic on it?"

"Go ahead. Well, since I'm here today, feel free to try."

"Thanks!"

<b>

So, I immediately tried using magic on the next slime that appeared.

I captured everything except the slime's core with space magic.

Transforming, sliding, and then blowing it apart as if it had been blown away by wind magic!

<b>

"Blast!"

<b>

With a pop! The slime's body exploded, leaving only the core. Success.

<b>

"Wow, you can do it!"

"…Not bad. With this, you should be able to earn your guild certificate quickly."

"Thanks to senpai keeping watch around, I can use magic with peace of mind."

"Oh, you have good sense to realize that. You really will become a good adventurer."

<b>

Thus, we safely obtained five unscathed slime cores each.
