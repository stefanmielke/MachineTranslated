# Safe, Safe

I'm Karina. I duplicated the (initial equipment) God gave me.

It's not fashionable to duplicate clothes ......!

<blank>

<blank>

What?　Duplicating items for sale is a last resort?

<blank>

This is for my own use, so it's safe!　Besides, I'm the kind of person who wants to complete the items available in the game.

Since there is a storage space like a "bag" in a game that can hold an infinite number of items, the initial equipment in God's work is "It's outrageous to sell it!" That's right.

<blank>

Well, this is safe because he was not trying to sell it, he was just grooming himself.

I was drunk, I don't know what I said. I do not remember. I'm stumped.

<blank>

......Oh, I'm a little flustered.

As God said, duplication seems to use quite a bit of MP.

<blank>

Thank you very much. We have said our goodbyes."

"Hm."

<blank>

Return the duplicate clothes to Harumikazuchi.

Harumikazuchi removes his mouth from the kiseru and exhales a puff of smoke to the side.

<blank>

......If the clothes are that important to you, why don't I just keep them instead of selling them?"

<blank>

What a kind man. This is my Hajimete's partner, or is he God?

No, thank God.

<blank>

Oh, don't worry about it. I actually have a couple of the same ones."

I'll be happy to sell it to you. Then I'll sell it off without hesitation. Well, it would be nice if I could use it myself.

<blank>

I answered that as well as an excuse in case he was wearing the same clothes the next time I saw him.

<blank>

Um, Mr. Harumikazuchi. Well, may I come back?"

I don't mind that we're a customer service company, but isn't it a bit much for a newcomer?"

<blank>

Ugh!　It's certainly the kind of place that a C-rank adventurer blade would be familiar with.

And it's also a restaurant that offers various kinds of entertainment, so it's no surprise that it's expensive.

I need to become a merchant soon so I can make money. ......

<blank>

And if it's my body you're after,...... I had a good time with you yesterday, but next time I'm going to charge you money.　Or a woman.

No, I mean. ...... how much, by the way."

"Well, maybe 100 gold coins, depending on how I'm feeling. ...... They're not for sale to begin with, Atashi."

<blank>

The giggling Harumikazuchi tickles my chin with her left hand, and my body reacts with a jerk.

My heart is sad and pounding as my chest squeezes tight...... duh, how in the world did I seduce this sister yesterday!

<blank>

<blank>

Ugh, it was ...... ha!"

Oh, senior woke up?"

Oh, oh ......"

<blank>

Braid woke up and sat up. He is wearing only a pair of pants.

I mean, if you look closely, you can see that he is rather muscular, as expected of an adventurer in the vanguard position.

<blank>

Oh, why am I naked?　Oh, sister."

You've made a pitiful sight of the newcomer, Blade.

Oooh. ......."

<blank>

Braid looks at us and makes a batty face.

<blank>

'Ahh. Can you ask for ...... on the tab?　At least for the equipment."

'Hun, you paid me once yesterday, so that's good. You'll have to earn it again."

I owe you!"

<blank>

Harumikazuchi, perhaps accustomed to doing this, gathers up his equipment and his empty wallet and tosses them next to Blade.

<blank>

You know what I'm saying, Karina? You have to keep your head down to get equipment like this. That's important advice from a senior colleague."

I understand.

"......, that's it. Sis, my sword is missing?"

<blank>

While putting on his clothes, Braid says, checking the equipment he received back.

Harumikazuchi replies, "Of course, of course," while puffing on his kiseru.

<blank>

I'll pay you back for the five large coins you gave me. I'll give you your money back after I pay you five large copper coins as a gratuity. Go hunt some slime, you're good at that, aren't you?"

<blank>

And while you're at it, take care of your daughter, too. Harumikazuchi laughs while puffing on his diesel.

Her tail is so fluffy, I want to mooch all over it, sis.

<blank>

...... I'm going to the materials yard after this. I'll show you my woodworking skills."

"Oooooh, I'm going to learn."

<blank>

What's, you know, how can I help you?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ah. By the way, diseases and birth control can be managed with magic and potions, and in fact, it seems that these stores have special magical equipment and are absolutely fine in many ways. (Excerpt from Basic Knowledge)

It's a great different world!

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

After preparing simple equipment with Blade's woodworking skills, he went slime hunting in the woods outside of town.

<blank>

He said, "Slime hunting is better with scrap equipment. When you think about it, it's a pretty good bang for the buck for a rookie, although it's risky."

<blank>

After hunting slime, it is said that the equipment must be well cared for or it will be ruined. If it is a simple piece of equipment that can be used and discarded, it can be thrown away.

<blank>

Don't just stand there, Carina," he said, "there aren't many slimes around here. There aren't many slimes around here, but there are a lot of them, and if you get surrounded by more than three, you'll die if you don't dash away.

I'll be careful!　I'll be careful!"

That's a good answer. You're going to be a good adventurer, kid."

<blank>

Braid senior, is it your habit to praise him like that?

<blank>

And don't do too much of what I'm about to do. It's good to be able to do it, but you newbies should be mature enough to crack the nucleus and take it down."

What are you going to do?"

It--well, it just came out.

<blank>

A stray slime that appeared in front of me. A poyon round water bun the size of a stump. Inside it floats a round nucleus.

<blank>

Braid aimed at the nucleus with a simple equipment square and launched a thrust.

The hornbeam invades the body of the slime with a sloppy motion - just before it hits the nucleus, it slows down for a moment and knocks, then accelerates again to push through - the intact nucleus is pushed out of the slime's body and rolls away.

<blank>

Oh!"

That's about it," he said. But if I leave it like this, it will turn back into slime, so I have to deliver it the same day after I hunt it.

<blank>

They will buy an intact nucleus at a higher price for it. Even a broken nucleus can be used as a material or nutrient for scavenger slime, so they will buy it at a reasonable price.

<blank>

I can spot ...... space magic and pull it out.

No, if you're going to disguise it as wind magic, I'd rather fly the puyopuyo around me.

<blank>

Can I try a little magic?"

I'll be here today. Well, I'm here today, so do what you want."

Aaaaah!"

<blank>

And I immediately used magic on the next slime that came out.

Spatial magic captures all but the core of the slime.

Transform, slide and break apart as if blown away by wind magic!

<blank>

Burst!"

<blank>

Snap!　and the viscous part exploded, leaving only the nucleus. Success.

<blank>

"Oh, that's good!"

I'm thinking, "......, you're doing a great job. I'm sure you'll make enough for a guild certificate in no time."

I can use magic with peace of mind knowing that my senpai is on the lookout for me."

You have good taste to know that, don't you? You're going to make a good adventurer.

<blank>

Thus we successfully obtained five slime nuclei (intact) each.
