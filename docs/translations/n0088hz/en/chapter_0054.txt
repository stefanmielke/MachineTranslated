# I defeated the pirates, so I'm taking a little break.

<b>

Before going to the lord's place, I’ll give a brief report to Dia-kun. I’m feeling a bit dizzy from using too much magical power, so I need to rest.

<b>

“So, there was no older sister at the pirates’ place.”

“...Um, what happened to the pirates?”

“I punished them, and the pirate ship and land base that were robbed from the pirates are over there!!”

<b>

Yes, in the storage space, the pirate ship has been restored to its original form, along with a portion of the sea that has been cut out, and the land base is preserved. The sea and the basement are placed in a way that makes it look like the floor or ground has been dented.

<b>

“What kind of person is Karina-onee-san...?”

“Oh, are you asking that? Hmm, well, since I’ve shown you this much, I’ll tell you the truth, Dia-kun. But it’s a secret just between us, okay?”

“Y-yes!”

<b>

Dia-kun swallows hard.

<b>

“Sometimes I’m a great magician! At other times, I’m a glamorous thief! And the reality is――”

“The reality is...!?”

“――I’m a rookie adventurer merchant, Karina Shonin-chan! Wahaha!”

<b>

Oh dear, Dia-kun is making a subtle face?

<b>

“Isn’t it usually the case that the true identity is something more amazing?”

“Well, that’s because all of them are the real me, and that’s the only true identity I haven’t told you about. Right?”

“...Um, well, I did hear about you being a merchant for the first time.”

<b>

Because it’s really true.

If you take away the great magician and the thief aspects, all that’s left is the cute Karina Shonin-chan.

<b>

I can’t say that I’m destined to deliver socks to the gods because it sounds kind of lame.

Oh, and there’s also the fact that I’m a former male from another world... making you call me “onee-san” while saying “I used to be a man” is definitely a no-go. Let’s keep that quiet!

<b>

But you know, a boy at this age would expect something cool for a true identity.

...I must meet those expectations! I’m sweet to cute kids!

<b>

“By the way, Great Magician Karina-chan actually has a noble mission to save the world.”

“Huh!? Save the world?”

“If things continue like this, the world’s energy will deplete, and this world will perish! To resolve that, I’ve been asked by the gods to recover the divine artifacts! That ship is also a divine artifact, so I recovered it!”

“Is that so! Amazing, Karina-onee-san!”

<b>

Well, more than that, I’m being told to deliver socks. The divine artifacts are just a bonus.

<b>

<b>

“My adventure has just begun, so I don’t have many tales to tell yet. That’s why my true identity is a secret. It would be troublesome if I couldn’t move freely.”

“So, in other words... you want to keep it so that the merchant Karina-onee-san and the great magician Karina-onee-san are seen as ‘different people’ in the public eye?”

“Oh! You’re smart, Dia-kun! That’s exactly right! Genius! So cute!”

<b>

I gently stroke Dia-kun, who has beautifully articulated what I wanted to say.

Ah, so cute and smart. It’s the best.

<b>

“Maybe I should wear a mask or something?”

“Oh, that sounds interesting... how about a mask like this!”

“I think it looks cool, Karina-onee-san!”

<b>

I used spatial magic to carve a simple mask out of wood!

When it comes to hiding one’s identity, a mask is a classic! Well, in manga and anime, there are often comments like “Can you really hide your identity with that mask?”... but in this world without social media, I feel like it might actually work!

<b>

<b>

“I’ll take a little break, and then I’ll head to the lord’s place... I’m not slacking off or anything, okay!? I just used too much magical power, so I need to rest and be in top shape, alright?”

“No one thinks Karina-onee-san is slacking off... In fact, I feel like I’m the useless one who can’t do anything...”

<b>

Dia-kun, holding onto the hem of his skirt, looks regretful.

It’s true that since I made him dress as a girl, he’s just been waiting in this storage space. It must be a bit tough for him to just trust a stranger (me) and wait.

<b>

“...It’s okay! Dia-kun is contributing a lot to me!”

“Is that so? I’m just dressed like this, right? What good am I?”

“Appearance is important. When the person you’re helping is cute, people tend to get more motivated.”

<b>

Even when helping someone in the same situation, it’s more motivating if they’re cute.

If the person were the opposite—ugly, cheeky, and ungrateful—this Karina-chan would lose the will to help. I’m not a saint, after all.

<b>

“So, Dia-kun’s current job is――to work harder on your appearance! Make me feel moe!”

“Moe...?”

“Making me feel motivated is your job, Dia-kun. The rest is up to you to figure out.”

<b>

When I said that, Dia-kun pondered, “Hmm.”

So cute, it’s a feast for the eyes.

Since I’m not actually going to do anything, it doesn’t matter if he’s a boy or a girl.

<b>

<b>

“Alright! Today, I’m going to drink some alcohol! But Dia-kun can’t, it’s too early for you.”

“...I can drink alcohol too, you know? I drank it in the elf country.”

“Is that so?”

<b>

Even if he looks like a child, he’s an elf, so he should be fine age-wise.

<b>

“Then how about just a sip? If that seems okay, I’ll let you drink more.”

“Yes, please.”

<b>

With that, I pour a little wine I obtained from comparing drinks with Gomez into a cup.

<b>

“Gulp... Phew, how is it? As you can see, it’s okay... right...?”

“Yeah, it’s definitely not okay. Hmm, maybe wine is too strong for a child.”

<b>

Or maybe I was just really tired from stress.

I take a sip of wine myself. I have to be careful not to drink too much or I’ll lose my memory.

<b>

...Ah, suddenly feeling sleepy. Hmm, I must have been tired from doing various things.

After a little rest, I need to go to the lord’s place... yawn.

<b>

...A blanket. I need to rest with a blanket. I can’t just leave Dia-kun sleeping on the floor like this, so I’ll join him. Hic. Zzz.
