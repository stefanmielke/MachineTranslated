# We've killed the pirates, so we're taking a break.

<blank>

Before going to the lord's place, I once made an interim report to Mr. Dear. I also need to rest because I am wobbly from using too much magic power.

<blank>

So there was no sister at the pirate's place.

...... Uh, what happened to the pirates?"

Punished and robbed from pirates, the pirate ship and land base will be over there!"

<blank>

Yes, in the storage space, a pirate ship restored to its original form, a partially cut out sea, and a land base were stored. As for the sea and the basement, they were placed as if the floor, or rather the ground, had been dented.

<blank>

Who is your sister Karina, ......?"

Oh, you're going to ask me that?　Well, now that I've shown you this much, I'll tell you the truth, Dear. But it's a secret between us, okay?"

Yes, sir.

<blank>

Dia gasps for air.

<blank>

One day he's a great wizard, the next he's a brilliant robber!　And other times, a brilliant robber!　And then there's what they really are..."

Well, the reality is ......!

"--I'm Carina Shonin, a new adventurer merchant!　Wahahaha!"

<blank>

Oops, Deere, you're looking a little delicate, aren't you?

<blank>

Isn't it usually the case that the real person is more awesome?"

No, I mean, they're all really me, and that's the only identity I haven't told you, Dear. Right?"

...... Um, well, I've certainly never heard of a merchant before."

<blank>

Because it really is true.

He said that if you take out the robbery part with the big wizard, all that's left is the lovely Karina Shonin.

<blank>

I can't even tell you that I'm destined to deliver socks to God because it's kind of uncool.

Oh, and there was the ex-male otherworlder. ...... I guess it's 'no' when you go out of your way to make people call you sister and then say "I'm an ex-male". I'll shut up!

<blank>

But, you know, a boy of this age would expect something cool like that.

...... We have to live up to those expectations!　She is a sweet girl, Carina, who is a sweet girl for a cute girl!

<blank>

Yes, yes. Karina, the great wizard, is actually on a noble mission to save the world."

What?　The world?"

If things continue as they are, the world's energy will be depleted and this world will be destroyed!　To solve that, I've been asked by God to recover a divine artifact!　That ship is also a divine artifact, so I recovered it!"

I'm so glad to hear that!　That's great, sister Karina!"

<blank>

Well, I've been told to deliver more socks than that. The sacred objects are a bonus.

<blank>

<blank>

My adventures have just begun, and I don't have many adventures to tell you about. That's why my identity is a secret. I don't want to get stuck."

"Well, you mean you want to keep your sister Karina as a ...... merchant and your sister Karina as a grand wizard 'separate in the eyes of the world'?"

Whoa!　You're a smart guy, Dear!　You're absolutely right!　Genius!　Cute!

<blank>

I gently caress Mr. Dear, who has beautifully verbalized what I want to say.

Aww, cute and smart. The best, huh?

<blank>

"Put on a mask, maybe?"

'Oh, that sounds interesting too: ...... how about a mask that looks like this!

I think it's cool, sister Karina!"

<blank>

I made a simple mask by cutting wood with spatial magic!

Masks are the standard when it comes to hiding one's true identity!　Well, in manga and anime, there are a lot of people who say, "How can you hide your true identity with such a mask? ......I think it's possible in this world without SNS!

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to go to my lord's next after I get some rest. I'm not skipping work.　I've used a little too much magic, so I'm going to take a break and make sure I'm in tip-top shape, okay?"

No one would think that Sis. Karina is slacking off. I'm more of a useless ...... who can't do anything ...... than you."

<blank>

Dia-kun looks frustrated, clutching the skirt of her dress.

It's true, I've been waiting in this storage space since I got her dressed as a woman. It must be a little hard to have to do nothing but wait and trust a stranger's sister (me).

<blank>

I'm fine with ......!　Dear you are very much contributing to me!"

"Oh, yeah?　I'm just dressed like this, you know?　What good is it doing me?"

Looks are important. When the person you're helping is pretty, people get excited.

<blank>

Even if you're helping someone in the same situation, the prettier you are, the more enthusiastic you'll be.

If this is the opposite of a cute, sassy, unappreciative partner, this Carina girl will be less inclined to help you. I am not a saint, you know.

<blank>

"In other words, Dear, your job now--to work harder on your looks!　Make me moan!"

"Moe ......?"

It's your job to motivate me. The rest is up to you."

<blank>

When I said that, Dia-kun thought, "Hmmm.

That's cute, what a feast for the eyes.

It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman, because it's not like they're actually going to put their hands on you.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to have a drink today!　We're going to have a drink today!　No, Dear, you can't, it's too early."

...... I can at least drink, too.　I used to drink in the land of the elves."

Really?"

<blank>

They may look like children, but they are elves, and I think they can afford to be in their actual age range.

<blank>

Then, "Do you want to try just one sip?　If it seems okay, I'll give it to you."

Yes, thank you.

<blank>

And I pour just a little bit of the wine Gomez and I got from the drinking contest into a glass.

<blank>

How about "Nkku ......p? As you can see, it's fine ...... and ...... kuka ......."

I knew it was no good at all. Well, maybe the wine is too strong for the child.

<blank>

Or was he very tired emotionally?

I also take a sip of my wine. I drink in moderation because I lose my memory if I drink too much.

<blank>

...... Oh, I'm suddenly feeling sleepy. Hmmm, I must have been tired from all the things I've done.

I need to get some rest and then I have to go to my lord's. ...... whew.

<blank>

...... Blankets. I need to rest in a blanket. I can't let you sleep on the floor like this, Deere. Aah! Hi.
