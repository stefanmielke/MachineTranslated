# What do dragons eat?

<b>

<b>

"Ah, soldier. My dragon apparently smelled like it had been exposed to some kind of aphrodisiac."

"Aphrodisiac?"

"Maybe it was forced into heat or something. I don't know."

"…Wait, can you understand the language of dragons!?"

<b>

Well, yeah. Dragons understand human language, and if they teach it, anyone can learn it, right? I figured out 'yes' and 'no' on my own, you know?

<b>

『…Normally, it's rare for a dragon to teach a human its language. I mean, it's a bit presumptuous to say this, but dragons are basically arrogant and treat weaklings with a big attitude. Plus, a dragon that's been a pet since birth is clueless about dragon language.』

<b>

So, it means they won't teach a weak human their language. Got it.

<b>

"Ah, well, I have the skill to understand dragon language. The details are a secret."

"Such a specific skill exists… The world is vast."

"Thanks to that, I can have a conversation with this one."

<b>

There's no need to hide it, so I’ll be honest.

<b>

"Indeed. You are utilizing a unique skill. Wonderful."

"With that in mind, it's possible that someone made an innocent dragon go into heat and cause a ruckus… Recently, there was a case where an imperial agent tried to destroy a dungeon in Karkassa and failed, so it seems a bit suspicious."

"…! Is that true!?"

"Yes, it's true. I came from Karkassa. You should ask others too."

"The Empire is making strange moves… I should write that in a letter."

<b>

Just then, the dwarf soldier finished writing the report and received the letter.

<b>

"I'll pay you one silver coin in advance. I've written that the rest should be paid at the gate, so please collect it there."

"Understood. I've got it."

"Then we shall patrol this area for a while. Thank you for your cooperation."

<b>

I received the silver coin and letter and saw off the dwarves riding on their flat turtles.

Phew, what a relief. I managed somehow.

<b>

『…Thank you so much, sister! I owe you one!』

"Not at all."

<b>

I hinted that this one had crushed some adventurers like an imperial agent, but it might not be entirely wrong. I don't know if it's lying.

<b>

『By the way, you had dragon fangs, huh? I feel a bit sorry about that.』

"Ah, can I take a few scales then? I've recently gotten into potion making, and I've been wondering what kind of material Thunder Dragon scales are."

『Hehe! If it's you, sister, I don't mind!』

<b>

Then, it straightforwardly plucked two or three scales and handed them to me.

<b>

『If you want, I can regularly give you scales from now on, so can I follow you, sister? I mean, if I'm not around, it might raise suspicion at the gate. I feel bad about that.』

"Ah, now that you mention it, that's true. Then, please do."

『Understood! Nice to meet you!』

<b>

Now that I think about it. If the letter said I was keeping a dragon, it would be a problem if I wasn't there. This one is surprisingly clever.

The dragon wags its tail happily from side to side.

<b>

"What do dragons eat?"

『Anything that isn't poison. I do need a decent amount, but I can hunt in the nearby forest if needed.』

"Hmm. Oh, then I need to introduce you to my companions. I decided to get a new pet."

『Understood! I'm a pet! …Wait, companions? You mean there are multiple people like you, sister!?』

<b>

The dragon immediately accepted its role as a pet, trembling and tilting its head.

<b>

"…Well, in terms of strength, I'm the strongest. But if you hurt or look down on my companions, you'll be put down, got it?"

『Eek!? I-I'll be fine! I'm a well-behaved dragon who had its fangs broken by you, sister!!』

<b>

After lightly threatening it, it curled up, hugging its tail.

Yeah, this should be fine to introduce to everyone!
