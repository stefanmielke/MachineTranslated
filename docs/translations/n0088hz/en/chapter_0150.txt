# What do dragons eat?

"Ah, soldier. My dragon says he smells like he's been drugged with an aphrodisiac.

An aphrodisiac?"

Maybe she was forced into heat or something. I don't know.

I mean, ......, do you even understand the language of dragons!"

<blank>

No, no, no. I think anyone can learn it if they learn from a dragon, since dragons can understand human language. I know Hi and Yiye on my own, you know?

<blank>

I have seen dragons teaching language to ningen (......), and it is a rare case. I don't mean to be so self-centered, but dragons are basically arrogant and have a big attitude toward small fry. Moreover, a loser dragon, who has been a pet since birth, doesn't understand dragon language.

<blank>

I guess they don't teach language to a small fry ningen. That makes sense.

<blank>

I have the skill to understand the language of dragons. The details are a secret.

'Such a limited skill set. ...... It's a big world out there.'

That's why I can talk to him.

<blank>

There is no need to hide it strangely, so I will be honest with you.

<blank>

Mm-hmm. So you're utilizing your peppy skills. Excellent."

I'm just putting this in perspective. It could be that someone put an innocent dragon in heat and made it go on a rampage ....... The other day, an Imperial agent tried to destroy a dungeon in Carcassa and failed.

"......!　Is that story true!"

Yes, it's true. I'm from Carcassa. You should ask other people."

"Reich, you're making strange moves ...... and you're going to write that in your letter too."

<blank>

And I received a letter from a dwarven soldier who had just finished writing a letter of report.

<blank>

I'll pay you one silver coin in advance. The rest I wrote to pay at the gate, so please pick it up there."

I'll take care of it. I understand."

Then we will look around for a while. Thank you for your cooperation.

<blank>

I took the silver coins and the letter and saw the dwarves off on their flat turtles.

Whew, oh dear. We made it.

<blank>

I'm so grateful to you, Miss ......!　Thank you for your help!

What the hell?

<blank>

I made it sound like this guy was an agent of the empire, but I'm sure I'm not mistaken. I don't know if he was lying, though.

<blank>

I'm sorry you had dragon fangs," he said. I feel sorry for you.

I've been into making potions lately, and I was wondering how much material is used to make the Thunder Dragon scales?　I've been into making potions lately, and I was wondering how much material is used to make the Thunder Dragon's scales?　I was wondering how much material the scales of the Thunder Dragon are made of.

I don't care if it's Miss!　I don't mind if you do, Miss.

<blank>

And then he plucked a couple of pieces out of my mouth and handed them to me.

<blank>

If you want, I'll continue to give you scales on a regular basis.　I mean, if I'm not there, I'll look suspicious at the gate or something. I am sorry.

"Oh, yeah, right. Well, hello."

I'm a very nice person!　Please come in!

<blank>

If you ask me. If the letter says I have a dragon following me or something, I have to stay. This guy is smarter than you think.

The dragon happily flaps its tail and wags it from side to side.

<blank>

What do dragons eat?"

I'll eat anything as long as it's not poisonous. I'd like to have a little bit of it, but if you want, I can hunt it down in the woods or something.

Hmmm. I'll have to introduce you to my friends. I've decided to get a new pet."

I am a pet!　I am a pet! ...... is your friend?　Don't tell me there's more than one like you!

<blank>

The dragon, who instantly accepted his pet's position, tilted his head, trembling.

<blank>

"...... Well, in terms of strength, I'm the strongest. But if you hurt or disrespect my people, I will kill you, okay?"

I'm okay!　It's okay!　I'm just a quiet dragon who got his fangs broken by Miss.

<blank>

I gave him a light scare and he curled up with his tail in a hug.

Yeah, yeah, this looks like a great way to introduce it to everyone!
