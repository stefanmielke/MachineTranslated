# Demon Tribe

<b>

Having decided on our destination, we promptly set out from the capital, Terralia One.

Since it feels a bit odd to keep calling her "Robe-chan," let's have her introduce herself soon. I had been avoiding touching on it until now because it seemed like there was something behind it.

<b>

"I apologize for the delay, my name is Youki."

"……Oh! A beautiful girl with black hair!"

<b>

When she removed her robe to show her face, there was a girl with a bob cut, black hair, and black eyes. She looked to be around high school age, perhaps? Two small horns were growing from her forehead.

<b>

"I see, so you are from the demon tribe."

"This is my first time seeing one as well. I've heard about the demon tribe in songs."

"Is that so? Interesting."

<b>

Apparently, she tends to be persecuted because she has monster blood. However, in the beastman country, it seems that being a deer beastman can just barely pass as a disguise.

<b>

"So, the hidden village is in this direction, right?"

"Yes. It is located about half a month's journey by carriage."

"Hmm? So that means we'll be going outside of Terralia Ruby."

<b>

The beastman country, Terralia Ruby, is a small nation with a small area. Traveling for half a month by carriage would likely take us from one end to the other.

<b>

"Yes. As for the location, it will be within the territory of the Gidlaraga Empire. We won't pass through the border fortress, but... by the way, where's the carriage?"

"Wow, so it's a case of illegal entry. Then there's no need to hold back."

<b>

With that, I rummaged through my backpack and took out a box. It was a palm-sized box.

<b>

"…And who is this attendant of yours?"

"Call me Karina-chan! This is a vehicle that serves as a substitute for a carriage."

<b>

When I tossed it, a container appeared. Of course, it was just a spatial magic swap—but inside this container, once you open the door and step in, it becomes a container house.

Naturally, it's a room created with spatial magic, and the furniture is made by the Five Great Elder Workshops. I promise a comfortable living experience.

<b>

"This is the vehicle? How does it move?"

"Arthur."

"Yo!"

<b>

With that, Arthur jumped onto the container and grew larger. On top of the container, there was a pole for holding it with feet. …It looked just like a giant carrying tray.

<b>

"So, Arthur will carry it like this, it's dragon air transport."

"Dragon air transport…!?"

"It's a comfortable journey through the skies. Even if this box falls, I've made preparations so that nothing will be a problem, so you can rest easy. And there's optical camouflage, so we won't be detected."

<b>

I then pushed Youki-chan into the container. I also had Dia-kun and Aisia get on. Don't worry, it's safe even if we fall!

<b>

"So, sis. In reality, it's your magic that does the heavy lifting, right? Ah, this is so easy!"

"Oh. Arthur will carry the box while flying, okay? I'll keep the box light, so please take care of it."

"What!? No way!?"

"I've attached a window to the bottom of the box, so we can look at the ground while actually flying. I want to know how long it takes for air transport in reality."

<b>

Well, good luck? I gave a thumbs up and stepped into the container myself.
