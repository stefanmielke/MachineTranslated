# Demons

<blank>

Having decided on our destination, we decided to leave the capital city of Teraliawan as soon as possible.

Since I can't stop saying "Loeb-chan, Loeb-chan," it's time for me to introduce myself. I have not mentioned it so far because it seems to have a reason.

<blank>

I'm sorry, my name is Yoki.

"...... Oh!　Beautiful dark-haired girl!"

<blank>

I took off my robe and asked to see her face, and there she was, a dark-haired, dark-eyed girl with big hair. She was about the age of a high school girl.　She has two small horns on her forehead.

<blank>

"I see... They are demons."

I've never seen them before. I've heard of them before in songs."

I didn't know there was such a thing. Heh."

<blank>

According to him, he is often persecuted because of his monster blood. However, in beastman country, it is just barely deceptive to say that you are a deer beastman.

<blank>

So, the hiding place is in this direction, right?"

Yes. It's about half a month's ride away by horse-drawn carriage."

Hm?"　So that would put us outside the terra realby?"

<blank>

Terra Realby is a small country with a small area. You could probably go from one end to the other in half a month by horse-drawn carriage.

<blank>

Yes. As for the location, it will be in the territory of the Gidlaga Empire. It does not pass through any border forts. ...... By the way, what about horse-drawn carriages?"

"Wow, so you're a smuggler. So you don't have to be afraid."

<blank>

I rummaged through my backpack and pulled out a box. It was a palm-sized box.

<blank>

"...... Squire, what's that?"

Call me Karina!　This is a vehicle instead of a carriage."

<blank>

I tossed it, and a container appeared. Of course, the container was only replaced by spatial magic, but when you open the door and go inside, you will see that it is a container house.

Of course, the room was created by spatial magic, but the furniture was made by Godai Old Studio. We promise you a comfortable life.

<blank>

Is this the ride?　How does it work?"

Arthur.

I'm soooooooo excited!"

<blank>

And then Arthur slammed into the top of the container and it became bigger. The top of the container has a stick to hold it by the feet. ...... It's like a giant okamochi.

<blank>

And this is how Arthur carries them, Dragon Air Transport.

Dragon Airlift......!"

It's a comfortable flight. If this box were to fall, we've prepared everything so that it won't cause any problems. And I have optical camouflage, so they won't recognize me.

<blank>

and push Yohki into the container. I'll have Dia-kun and Aysia get on board too. Don't worry, you'll be safe even if you fall!

<blank>

So, Miss. In fact, you're going to use your magic to make it happen, aren't you?　Oh no, it's so easy!

Oh. I'll have Arthur fly with the box, okay?　I'll keep the box light, but thanks."

I'm not sure I can do that!　Oh, no!"

I put a window in the bottom of the box so you can see what's going on on the ground and have it actually fly. I'd like to know how long it actually takes to fly.

<blank>

Well, good luck?　And with a thumbs up, I went inside the container too.
