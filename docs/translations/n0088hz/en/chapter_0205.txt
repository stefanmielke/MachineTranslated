# Get the hell out of here. You have a family too.

"--Now, our first sacrifice is a D-rank adventurer!　Karina Shonin!!!!"

<blank>

Oops, I got called. Here I go.

<blank>

So when I came out onto the arena stage, the mortar-shaped audience was full and very excited.

I left after the other party, so I didn't hear their name or anything else.

But I was told beforehand that it was the first match.

<blank>

Well, we'll just have to fight it out on the spot.

I'm sure I'll forget tomorrow when I hear their name anyway, so I don't really care.

<blank>

I walked leisurely to the center of the arena, where there were several rings around me and a tournament was going on at the same time, and I was directed to the most prominent ring in the center.

<blank>

Yes, Dear, Isiah, are you watching?

<blank>

'Sacrifice is terrible, even if it's just a sacrifice. Hey, don't you think so?"

......Since when did this become a dance venue?"

<blank>

When I approached my opponent, he said something like that in a carefree manner.

He is a strong white wolf beastman with scars all over his body, as if he has fought many battles in his life.

He is a complete mofumo type of beastman, and he feels the same way as Masilo in that regard.

<blank>

But I heard that there are a lot of Blutbaden in Terra Realby. I heard from Mr. Masilo that even the king is a Blutbad.

So, Mr. Masilo must be royalty, right?　I thought so, but I heard that 50% of the population is White Blutbaden, and 10% of them are full-blooded Mohammedans. So at best, they are distant relatives of the same ancestors.

They say that because they are the largest force, they are also the most numerous. They say they have almost nothing to do with almost anything.

<blank>

You are the little daughter of the human race. If you abstain, I will allow you to do so. I don't think you're ready to be a fighter with that ...... outfit."

Haha, nice joke. I'm carrying 82 gold coins betting on me winning, remember?　There's no way I'm going to abstain or anything. Or are you going to give me 820 gold coins for the payout?　Oh, and you'd better put the fight money and the winnings on it, too."

"...... How!　Oh, I see. My apologies."

<blank>

and his opponent, who is hunched over and poised without hands.

<blank>

Let's go.

What does ...... say about the referee's signal?"

The battle has already begun!

<blank>

Next thing I know, a white fluffy thing appears in front of me.

Wow, I thought I had moved instantly. The fist came aiming at my dove tail as it was, so I just took it as it was for now.

<blank>

"......!　What's this feeling ......?"

It's magic!"

<blank>

Then I grabbed the other white wolf's fist and lifted it up by the waist while turning my back in a circle and threw it away. It's a backstroke throw!　Ippon!

<blank>

I'm not moving, I'm not moving. ......　I can't move my body. ......"

Hehe, I'm sorry. Well, it's the first round, so let's just get it over with.

<blank>

I have deprived my opponent of his freedom with spatial magic. As it is, the opponent cannot do anything and cannot move, so I win.

Oh, I'll be sure to restore your physical freedom once victory is confirmed. Just hang tight for a while longer.

<blank>

<blank>

......

<blank>

What?　I've already won this, right?　Mr. Referee?"

What?　Oh, Sho, the winner ...... Carina player ......!"

<blank>

Yeah. I won.

Nevertheless, it was definitely a battle that lacked excitement. The venue seemed to have fallen silent.

<blank>

...... is it too boring to be easily settled with a single backstroke? I wonder if I should follow Dia's example and do a microphone performance?

No, they are fighting around us too, so I don't mind. I wonder if the guy in the ring nearby is okay, because he's staring at me, and there's a lot of openings. Have you noticed the emergence of a strong rival?

<blank>

Oops, let's unbind our opponents, shall we?

<blank>

What the hell was that?　What the hell was that?　It wasn't poison, was it?　I can't move at all!

It's a special throwing technique that stimulates pressure points by striking the back hard enough to temporarily block the opponent's action. It's a special throwing technique that stimulates pressure points by striking the back hard enough to temporarily block the opponent's action."

What a ......!

<blank>

Since there was no need to tell him an honest story, I told him appropriately, and the white wolf nodded with a mysterious look on his face, as if he believed me.

<blank>

By the way, let's see. Are you sure you want to go back to the waiting room after we win this?"

"...... No. We will have our next battle right here on the center stage, right?"

I'll just wait here, then. I guess I'll just wait here then. Thanks. Then, the losers should go home quickly. You have a family, too."

"...... oh."

<blank>

Well, now that the first match is over, I'm going to do some bending over to get ready for the next one.

<blank>

----------------

(The staff is puzzled as to whether to proceed as is!

His opponent in the second game is also confused by the returning Beast King!

The audience is also bewildered by the sudden and easy defeat of the Beast King!

Isiah is smug!

(And Mr. Dear seems to have guessed something.)
