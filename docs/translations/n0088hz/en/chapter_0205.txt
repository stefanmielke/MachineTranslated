# Hurry up and go home. You have a family too, right?

“—Well then, the first sacrifice is D-rank adventurer! Karina Shonin!!!”

<b>

Oh, I’ve been called. Here I go.

<b>

So when I stepped onto the arena stage, the bowl-shaped spectator seats were packed and buzzing with excitement.

I came out after my opponent, so I didn’t hear their introduction at all.

But I had heard beforehand that this was the very first match.

<b>

Well, I guess I’ll just have to fight on the spot.

After all, even if I heard my opponent's name, I’d probably forget it by tomorrow, so it doesn’t matter.

<b>

I walked leisurely to the center of the arena—amidst multiple rings where tournaments were being held simultaneously, I was directed to the most prominent ring in the center.

<b>

Yay, Dia-kun, Aisia, are you watching?

<b>

“Still, calling it a sacrifice is harsh. Don’t you think so?”

“...Since when did this place become a dance hall?”

<b>

When I called out to my opponent, they casually said that.

They were a strong-looking white wolf beastman, covered in scars, giving off a seasoned vibe.

A completely fluffy type of beastman, similar to Mashiro-san in that regard.

<b>

But apparently, there are a lot of white wolf beastmen in this Terrarialby. I heard from Mashiro-san that even the king is a white wolf beastman.

So doesn’t that mean Mashiro-san is also royalty? I thought, but it turns out that 50% of the population is white wolf beastmen, and 10% of those are completely fluffy. So it’s probably just a distant relative from the same ancestor.

It seems that they are the largest faction, which is why there are so many of them. They are said to have almost no relation at all.

<b>

<b>

“You little human girl. If you want to forfeit, I’ll acknowledge it. ...I can’t possibly believe that you’re prepared to fight in that outfit.”

“Haha, nice joke. I’m carrying 82 gold coins that I bet on my victory, you know? There’s no way I’m forfeiting. Or are you going to gift me 820 gold coins as a prize? Oh, and don’t forget the fight money and the championship prize too.”

“...Oh! Is that so? My apologies.”

<b>

With that, my opponent lowered their stance and prepared to fight unarmed.

<b>

“Then, let’s go.”

“...Wait, what about the referee’s signal?”

“The battle has already begun!!”

<b>

In the next moment, a white fluff appeared right in front of me.

Whoa, I thought they had teleported. As their fist aimed for my solar plexus, I decided to just take it for now.

<b>

“...What is this sensation...?”

“It’s magic!”

<b>

Then I grabbed the white wolf’s fist, turned my back, and lifted them up to throw them. A back throw! One point!!

<b>

“Gah...! My body won’t... move...”

“Hehe, sorry about that. Well, it’s the first round, so let’s wrap it up quickly.”

<b>

I was using spatial magic to restrict my opponent’s freedom. As it stands, they couldn’t do anything, and I was assured of my victory.

Oh, once my victory is confirmed, I’ll return their freedom of movement. Just stay frozen for a little while longer.

<b>

<b>

……

<b>

“Hey? Is it okay for me to just win now? Referee?”

“Huh? Ah, the winner... Karina contestant...!?”

<b>

Yep. I won.

That said, it was undeniably a lackluster fight. I felt like the venue was eerily quiet.

<b>

...Winning so easily with just one back throw is a bit boring. Should I take a page out of Dia-kun’s book and do some mic performance?

No, since there are others fighting around, it’s probably fine. Someone on a nearby ring is staring at me intently and seems wide open. Did they notice the emergence of a strong rival?

<b>

Oh, I should release my opponent from their restraint.

<b>

“Cough! Wh-what was that, exactly!? It wasn’t poison, was it? My body has completely stopped moving!”

“Ha! It’s a special throwing technique that stimulates pressure points by hitting the back hard, temporarily sealing your actions.”

“What...!!”

<b>

Since there’s no need to honestly reveal the trick, I said it casually, and the white wolf nodded with a solemn expression as if they believed me.

<b>

“By the way, um... If I win, can I just go back to the waiting room?”

“...No. We plan to have the next fight immediately on this central stage.”

“Hmm. So I just need to wait here. Thanks. Well then, the loser should hurry up and go home. You have a family too, right?”

“...Ah.”

<b>

Well then, the first match is over, so I’ll do some stretching to prepare for the next match.

<b>

----------------

(The staff are confused about whether to proceed as is!

The opponent for the second match is also confused as the Beast King has returned!

The audience is bewildered as the Beast King was suddenly defeated!

Aisia has a smug face!

And Dia-kun seems to have sensed something.)
