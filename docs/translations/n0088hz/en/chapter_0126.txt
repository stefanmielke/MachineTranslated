# Empire!　Is that what it's all about?

<blank>

Yes, let's give them some items to contact us as well."

and produces five pieces similar to the ones he gave to Mr. Masiro and places them on the table.

If something goes wrong, just tap on it and talk to me, and I'll hear you. It will work for two weeks, give or take.

"This is ...... such a valuable magical tool. Thanks for your help."

<blank>

It's not a magical tool, but let's not get into it. Mr. Healer can also make magical tools, so it's just as well.

<blank>

<blank>

And, Mister Healer, I have one more favor to ask you. I have one more favor to ask of you.

"Mm?　What is it?　Depends on what it is."

It's about the bomb that was planted in the core of the dungeon."

<blank>

Oh, well, there was something like that.

<blank>

"Oh, Guillermas, have you figured it out yet? What is it, Guilmouth? Have you figured out what it is already?　You're a fast investigator."

I'm sure it's obvious, Silver. I had some idea of what was going on when you brought it to me yesterday.

"Well, why didn't you say so earlier?"

<blank>

Oh dear," shrugs Mashiro.

Garoon laughs it off with a huff.

<blank>

'If I were to bypass my personal intuition, it would be an international problem, wouldn't it?　Well, I had him check it out, and he was right.

Hmm?　That means there were other countries involved. An empire?"

I'm not sure what to make of it. It was apparently the work of the Gidlaga Empire. It means that a bomb was planted in the core by sneaking through the magic tools of the warding. The fact that ...... the warding was subverted is not that surprising. The empire is the second most advanced country in magic tools after the alchemy kingdom."

<blank>

Gidlaga Empire!　Is that what it's all about?

<blank>

What is the Gidlaga Empire? What is the Gidlaga Empire?　Sorry, I'm not familiar with the mundane world."

I see. Then let me explain."

<blank>

His name is cool, too, with all those muddy letters. Is he an evil emperor or something? I'm a little excited.

<blank>

The Ghidoraga Empire is a great power that controls half of this continent. They claim that dungeons are evil beings that suck the energy out of the world and that the world will be destroyed if this situation continues. They claim that the number of dungeons should be reduced. ...... We can say that they are incompatible with us, the Kingdom of Pavelkant."

<blank>

Oh, that's the truth. Mr. Empire said it right. ......

I'm not just talking about dungeons, I'm talking about sacred objects in general, but there's nothing wrong with that.

<blank>

"Then I'd say destroy your own dungeons first, but you're actually reducing them. ...... You don't seem to be destroying all the stones, but you're certainly reducing them."

And you're forcing it on the rest of the world?

<blank>

Hmm?　Then why didn't they put a bomb on the core and blow it up right away? Let's ask him.

<blank>

Is there any reason why they didn't just blow it up?"

Our alchemist told me that the timer was set to explode a few days later, on the new moon. Perhaps they were aiming for the core to be weakened.

<blank>

Mr. Empire, who destroys dungeons, is said to be making progress in dungeon research.

They were aiming for a weakened day in order to ensure its destruction.

In fact, if I hadn't found it, it would have been blown up!

<blank>

'Hmmm, Mister Masilo. On the day of the new moon, will the core be weakened?"

'No thanks, if anything it will revitalize the dungeon. There will be more monsters."

You're right," he said. But wouldn't it make sense if the activation of the dungeon was the opposite: 'The core is weakening, so they're fortifying the perimeter'?"

Oh, sure!　That's what I'm talking about, Guilmouth, you're a smart guy."

<blank>

Oh, I see. Well, that's one way to look at it.

<blank>

<blank>

So. It is expected that the operative who planted the bomb will move toward the new moon. That side must not yet be aware that the bomb has been removed, ...... but there's also the question of how the operative got to the back of the dungeon in the first place."

Yes, the doorkeeper!　Ask the doorkeeper, and you'll find out who's suspicious!

...... By the way, if you just look at the situation, the most suspicious person is Mr. Healer."

<blank>

Hmm?　Me?

<blank>

He ignored the door guard and went to the lower level. It is also possible that he lied about the bomb being attached to the core in the first place, and that he only tricked Shiragane by showing him the bomb he had brought. The most important thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're getting into. In addition, the style ......"

<blank>

...... Surely, there are only suspicious elements?
