# Empire! So that's a thing.

"Right, let me give you some items for contact as well."

<b>

I created five items similar to the magatama I gave to Mashiro-san and placed them on the table.

<b>

"If anything happens, just give it a light tap and it will reach me. The effect lasts comfortably for two weeks."

"This is... such a precious magical tool. Thank you for your cooperation."

<b>

It's not a magical tool, but I won't point that out. The healer can create magical tools, so it's just right.

<b>

<b>

"And, Healer-dono, I have one more request, if that's alright."

"Hm? What is it? It depends on the content."

"It's about the bomb that was set in the dungeon's core."

<b>

Ah, now that you mention it, there was that.

<b>

"Oh. What is it, Guild Master? Have you figured something out already? You're quick to investigate."

"Of course, Shirogane. This is a major issue for the dungeon. I had a rough idea since the moment you brought it in yesterday."

"Oh, if that's the case, you should have told me sooner."

<b>

Good grief, Mashiro-san shrugs.

Garoon lightly laughs it off.

<b>

"If I were to say something careless based on personal intuition, it could become an international issue, right? Well, the results of my investigation turned out to be just that."

"Hm? So that means other countries were involved. The Empire?"

"Yes. It seems that was the work of the Gidlaraga Empire. The bomb was placed in the core, bypassing the magical tools of the barrier. ...It's not too surprising that the barrier was bypassed. The Empire is a leading country in magical tools, second only to the Alchemy Kingdom."

<b>

Gidlaraga Empire! So that's a thing.

<b>

"Garoon-dono, what is the Gidlaraga Empire? I'm sorry, but I'm not well-versed in the secular world."

"Is that so? Then let me explain."

<b>

The name is cool with lots of voiced consonants. I wonder if they have an evil emperor or something. I'm a bit excited.

<b>

"The Gidlaraga Empire is a major power that controls half of this continent. They claim that 'dungeons are a malevolent existence that sucks the energy from the world, and if this continues, the world will perish. The number of dungeons should be reduced'... and they can be said to be an existence that is incompatible with our Pavelkant Kingdom."

<b>

Ah, that's the truth. The Empire was saying something correct...

To be precise, it's not just dungeons but all divine artifacts, but they aren't wrong about anything.

<b>

"Then they should first destroy their own country's dungeons, but they are actually reducing them... It seems they won't destroy all of them, but they are definitely reducing them."

"And they are forcing that onto other countries as well."

<b>

Huh? Then why didn't they attach the bomb to the core and blow it up immediately? Should I ask?

<b>

"Is there some reason they didn't just blow it up right away?"

"Our alchemist said that a timer was set to explode on the new moon a few days later. Probably, they were aiming for the timing when the core would weaken."

<b>

The Empire, which destroys dungeons, seems to be advancing research on them as well.

As a result of aiming for certain destruction, they targeted the day of weakening.

In fact, if I hadn't found it, it would have been blown up.

<b>

"Hmm, Mashiro-dono. Does the core weaken on the new moon?"

"No, rather, the dungeon becomes activated. Monsters increase."

"That's right, just as Shirogane said. However, if the activation of the dungeon is because 'the core weakens, so they are fortifying the surroundings,' don't you think that makes sense?"

"Oh, that's true! As expected of the Guild Master, you're smart."

<b>

Oh. I see, that's one way to look at it.

<b>

<b>

"So, it is predicted that the operatives who set the bomb will move towards the new moon. They probably haven't realized that the bomb has been removed yet... but there's also the question of how the operatives got deep into the dungeon."

"That's right, the door guard! If we ask the door guard, we might find out about any suspicious individuals!"

"...By the way, if we just look at the situation, the most suspicious one is the healer."

<b>

Huh? Me?

<b>

"You ignored the door guard and went down to the lower levels. Moreover, the claim that there was a bomb attached to the core could be a lie, and you might have just shown the bomb you brought to Shirogane to deceive himâ€”there's that possibility as well. In that case, there's no need to bypass the barrier in front of the core. Plus, that appearance..."

<b>

...Indeed, there are only suspicious elements, huh?
