# Conversations with Dragons

<blank>

To talk with a dragon, you must first subdue it. This is common sense.

A prideful dragon cannot speak properly without first knocking down the pillar of pride that is its strength. Arthur said.

'I give you the ...... territory. Please forgive me."

I'm just here for fun. I'm just here for fun."

"U, Usu."

<blank>

The black dragon bowed its head with a bow. Its cheek was swollen from my blow.

<blank>

I was so impressed by her strength. She broke my heart with one blow.

"Well, it's God's power," he said. It's God's power that we can talk like this."

I envy you, God bless you!　'Yes, the most powerful ningen in the world!　The most powerful ningen in the world!

Haha, just a fact."

That's true, ha ha ha.

<blank>

I patted him on the shoulder with enthusiasm. The dragon's eyelids twitched in pain.

......Pressuring in this way is also an important form of interdragon communication.

<blank>

"So, did you demand a sacrifice or something from the demon tribe?"

'Well, I did say a long time ago to offer up the egg thief, but no specific sacrifice.

"What about selfishness, like you have to be a pure maiden or something like that?"

What?　It doesn't matter if the egg thief is a pure maiden, does it?"

I know, right?"

<blank>

As Arthur said, it seems that it was a pattern of passing the buck from the egg thief to the culprit.

<blank>

So, have you had your eggs stolen again recently?　We were talking about offering a sacrifice."

What?　I haven't had any eggs taken from me in the last 10 years, so I haven't made them take any responsibility for it.

Oh, really?"

'Us. Oh, do you want to bring some eggs?　They are unfertilized eggs. I've been practicing heating them up.

Is that your mother's?"

You seem to know a lot about it. No, they are hers.

<blank>

What's wrong with you, you have a girlfriend or you're a real person? Pfft.

...... Oh, but now I have 5 wives too!　Forgive me!

<blank>

I'll bring you some eggs, by all means!"

Oh, yes, but what does it mean that the dragon doesn't demand sacrifice, but the ogre village does? But what does it mean that the dragon doesn't demand sacrifice, but the demon tribe's village demands sacrifice?

I don't eat people to begin with. I don't eat people to begin with. ...... Oh, is she my girlfriend?　I don't think so, but let me ask you something.

Oh, I see. If you have a girlfriend, it could be that way. Shall we go to the den?"

I'll show you around. I'll show you around.

<blank>

And then the dragon turns around and flies off with a whiz.

He casually tried to leave me behind, so I gently transitioned and stood on the dragon's head.

<blank>

'Hiii!　Faster than the Thunder Dragon!　How did you move now?

"Oh, don't think that you and your girlfriend might be able to beat me.

I'll make sure to tell Tsure about it!　I'll make sure to tell Tsure as well!

<blank>

Thus I rode the dragon's head to the den.
