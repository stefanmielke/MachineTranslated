# Conversation with a Dragon

<b>

To converse with a dragon, you must first assert dominance over it. This is common knowledge.

A proud dragon cannot have a proper conversation unless you first break the pillar of its pride, which is its strength. This is what Arthur said.

<b>

『...I will give you my territory. Please forgive me.』

“Oh, that's fine, you don't need to do that. I just came to play.”

『U, understood.』

<b>

The black dragon bowed its head slightly. Its cheek was swollen from my strike.

<b>

『But still, you're really strong, sister. You broke my spirit with just one hit.』

“Well, that's the power of a god. It's thanks to the god's strength that we can talk like this.”

『Having the protection of a god is enviable! Wow! The strongest human in the world!』

“Ha ha ha, that's just a fact.”

『That's true, ha ha ha.』

<b>

We hit it off and I patted its shoulder. The dragon grimaced in pain.

…Applying pressure like this is also an important part of communication with dragons.

<b>

“So, did the demon tribe ask for a sacrifice or something?”

『Well, I did say a long time ago that they should offer up the egg thief, but not specifically for a sacrifice or anything.』

“Isn't there some selfish demand like it has to be a pure maiden or something?”

『? Does it matter if the egg thief is a pure maiden or not?』

“Right?”

<b>

As Arthur said, it seemed to be a misunderstanding regarding the accountability for the egg thief.

<b>

“So, have there been any egg thefts recently? I heard they were asking for a sacrifice.”

『Huh? I haven't had any eggs stolen in the last ten years, so I haven't made anyone accountable for anything.』

“Really?”

『Yeah. Oh, do you want me to bring an egg? It's a fertilized egg, though. I was practicing warming it.』

“Is that your girlfriend's?”

『You know a lot. Well, it's hers.』

<b>

What do you mean you have a girlfriend? How annoying. Ugh.

…Oh, but I also have five wives now! I forgive you!

<b>

『Then I'll bring the egg, so please wait!』

“Oh, okay. But if the dragon isn't asking for a sacrifice, then why is the demon tribe asking for one?”

『That's not me, sister. I don't eat humans anyway... Oh, maybe it's my girlfriend? I don't think so, but should I ask her?』

“Oh, right. If you have a girlfriend, that could be a possibility. Shall we go to the nest?』

『Yeah. I'll guide you.』

<b>

With that, the dragon turned and took off into the sky.

It tried to leave me behind casually, so I quietly teleported to stand on top of the dragon's head.

<b>

『Hii! Faster than a Thunder Dragon!? How did you move just now!?』

“Oh, you shouldn't think that you can beat me if it's two against one with your girlfriend.”

『U, understood! I'll make sure to tell my friend too!!』

<b>

Thus, I rode on the dragon's head as we headed toward the nest.
