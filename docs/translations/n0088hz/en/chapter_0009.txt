# Lost memories (just a drunk) ●Illustrations

<blank>

<blank>

My name is Karina!　I was drinking with senior adventurers and gathering information!

A generous senior adventurer offered to buy me a drink, even though I was poor, and I enjoyed it.

<blank>

As a result, I'm hungover now and my head is fucking burning.

<blank>

"......, my balls hurt ......!"

<blank>

Then I squint at the morning sun coming in.

Uh, ...... what happened yesterday after all since then?

As I recall, after the Adventurer's Guild was knocked out at the end of business hours or something like that, let's see, ......

<blank>

<blank>

~~~~~~

<blank>

I've had enough to drink!　Hey Karina, I'll show you a place I know!　Come on!

Hei, Braid senior!　I'll go with you!

What? Wait a minute, Blade!　You're not at the Shun Lai Pavilion, are you!　Hey Shildon, let's stop Blade!　He's sleeping!

"Gugah ...... I'll stop ...... it!"

Hey!　At least let me go!　That's no place for a girl to go!"

<blank>

~~~~~~

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm, so I left Sekko and Shildon and went to a place called Shun Lai Tei and indulged in a drink with a ...... beautiful lady and ...... uh.... ...

<blank>

I don't know why I'm naked!　I'm wearing underwear and one sheet to be exact!

And next to him is Braid-senpai, who is also wearing only a pair of pants!

<blank>

What, that!　Nande!

Don't tell me you've had it on the first day of a girl's life!　Eeeeeeeeee!　And my head is also itching!　woop......

<blank>

Oh, I see you're awake.

"Ogu ...... hmm?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I looked in the direction of the voice, I saw an older woman with blonde hair tied up and puffing on a kiseru. She was wearing a chic black dress that showed off her curves perfectly. She had the air of a woman who knows what she's doing, and she looked so cool. She was too good to be true!

And noteworthy are its ears and tail. It's a fox!　A beastie!　Wow, I've never seen it before!　It's so otherworldly!

<blank>

Oh, man, I'm getting excited. I ask, once I've mended the surface to appear calm.

<blank>

"...... um, you are ......"

Owner of Shunrai Pavilion. Harumikazuchi. From the looks of it, he doesn't even remember yesterday's spree. ......"

<blank>

Harumikazuchi exhales smoke in disgust.

Oh my gosh, you are so beautiful and pretty with such movement. I'm going to fall in love with her. She would definitely look good in a china dress or something.

<blank>

I mean, um, did I do something ...... by any chance?"

I'll tell you what, I'll just rip his stuffed shirt off and charge him for it. I'd like to see you and Braid get your stuffed animals and charge them for it."

<blank>

Oh, you were naked because you were stripped down.

If it's ......, is it still lethal?　Safe?　Harumikazuchi says, "Oh my goodness," as I look at Blade with a scornful look on my face.

<blank>

Don't worry. Blade didn't touch you. I don't know if he did while you were sleeping."

Oh, really?　Good!"

<blank>

I had my underwear on, so I guess that area is safe. Yoshi!

<blank>

'Yes, that's right. Yesterday's should have been Blade-senpai's treat, so please just return my clothes!"

Your clothes cost another. Here, I'm holding your socks.

Eh. Uh, ......."

<blank>

I just realized that I was clutching a black sock in my right hand.

Apparently, I had drunkenly asked this fox lady for a sock.

I'll make it into an offering to the gods, in exchange for clothes because I don't have any money, or something.

(By the way, the universal ID is in the storage space, so it's safe.)

<blank>

I got some old clothes in change because the tailoring was so good. I'll give you back your temporary guild card, which is worthless. I'll also return your temporary guild certificate, which is worth nothing.

......

<blank>

I wore old clothes ...... and they are a bit stiff. I mean, it kind of rubs a lot.

Ugh, and I feel some kind of foreign body in my waist, or rather, in my bellybutton. ...... Oh, wasn't chastity supposed to be safe?

<blank>

"Oh, are you all right?　I'm sorry, I didn't know it was your first one and I ate it."

Eh."

<blank>

Mr. Harumikazuchi smiles with a giggle.

Uh, hmm. You mean?

<blank>

Does that mean my first time is with Mr. Harumikazuchi!"

I said, "Yes, I'm sorry about that. I'm a little sorry about that part--"

Yay!!! ！！！！"

<blank>

Goodbye unicorn!　Leave the virgin kitchen!

Hello Bicorn!　I look forward to working with you for many years to come!

<blank>

Such a beautiful woman and a hajimete graduate....how great!

The best of another worldoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！！　Thank you Godoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！！

<blank>

'Oh, but I was so drunk I don't remember any of it!　Oh noooooo!!!!"

......, what was that thing you did yesterday?"

<blank>

Apparently, this tension had done it again last night.

<blank>

Oh, um, by the way, how do you feel about ......?"

Hmm?"　Oh, yeah. My store is a bar on the first floor, and we have a stage there. ...... (giggles) ...... more ......"

"Nah ...... that's such an embarrassing thing to do!"

I'm ashamed to admit that I've done some terrible things when I think back on them. ......

<blank>

I'm a terrible person, I was yesterday!　Drinking is scary!

But thanks to such a beautiful sister and ...... so, memory, revive my memory!

<blank>

Nuh, nuh, nuh, I can't remember at all. ...... What a waste.

...... I guess I'll have to moderate my drinking.

<blank>

<blank>

The first thing that comes to mind is that I'm not saying I want to return them. Oh, by the way, my clothes were given to me by a very important person. ...... I'm not asking you to give them back, but may I say goodbye for the last time?"

Hmm?　I wouldn't mind that much."

<blank>

When I say this, Harumikazuchi brings me clothes. Clothes that I could say were a part of me, so to speak, that God made together with this body.

I hold on tight. I embrace.

<blank>

Thank you for all you've done for me. ...... I will never forget you!"

<blank>

When you hide it with your body, yes, it is a duplicate. A copy is born in the storage space.

Then, the original and the duplicate were replaced, just in case.

<blank>

Well, it's a good tailored dress. It can't be helped. I don't feel good to wear stiff clothes.

I'll change my clothes later.
