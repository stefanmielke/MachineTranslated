# Lost Memories (Just a Drunk) ●Illustrations Included

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina! I was pouring drinks for senior adventurers and gathering information!

The generous senior adventurer treated me to some drinks, so I enjoyed them deliciously.

<b>

As a result, I’m now hungover and my head hurts like hell.

<b>

“...My head hurts...!”

<b>

And I squint at the morning sun streaming in.

Ah... what happened after that yesterday?

If I remember correctly, after being kicked out of the adventurers' guild because it was closing time, um...

<b>

<b>

～・～・～

<b>

“Damn it, I’m not done drinking! Hey Karina, I’ll introduce you to a familiar place! Come on!”

“Yes, Blade-senpai! I’ll accompany you!”

“Wait, hold on, Blade! It’s not the Shunrai Inn, is it!? Hey, Shildon, stop Blade! Oh, he’s sleeping!”

“Gugah... I’ll stop him... ugh.”

“Hey! At least let me go! That’s not a place for girls!”

<b>

～・～・～

<b>

<b>

Hmm, so I left Sekko and Shildon behind and went to the Shunrai Inn... got drunk with a beautiful lady... and, um...

<b>

Wait, why am I naked!? Well, technically I’m wearing just my underwear and a sheet!

And next to me is Blade-senpai, also just in his underwear!

<b>

Huh, what!? Why!?

Could it be that on my first day as a girl, I actually did it!? Waaaaah!? And my head hurts so much! Ugh...

<b>

“Oh, looks like you’re awake.”

“Ugh... huh?”

<b>

<b>

When I looked towards the voice, there was a lady with her blonde hair tied up, puffing on a kiseru. She wore a chic black dress that perfectly outlined her body. She exuded an aura of a capable woman, and she was cool. This was an incredibly lovely lady!

And what’s noteworthy are her ears and tail. A fox! A beast person! Wow, I’ve never seen one before! This feels so much like another world!

<b>

Oh no, I’m getting excited. I tried to calm myself down on the surface and asked.

<b>

“Um, who are you...?”

“I’m the owner of the Shunrai Inn. Harumikazuchi. From the looks of it, you don’t remember last night’s ruckus at all...”

<b>

Hoo, Harumikazuchi exhaled smoke with an exasperated look.

Oh dear, even that action is beautiful. I might fall in love. She would definitely look good in a cheongsam.

<b>

“Um, did I, by any chance, do something...?”

“Oh, you certainly did. I had to strip you and Blade over there and charge you for it.”

<b>

Ah, so the reason I was naked was that I was stripped.

...Then I haven’t done anything yet? Safe? As I looked at Blade with a puzzled expression, Harumikazuchi said, “Oh dear.”

<b>

“Don’t worry. Blade didn’t touch you. I don’t know what happened while you were asleep, though.”

“Oh, is that so? That’s a relief.”

<b>

Since I was still wearing my underwear, that part should be fine. Good!

<b>

“By the way, yesterday’s drinks were on Blade-senpai, so please return at least my clothes!”

“Your clothes are charged separately. Look, you’re holding my sock.”

“Huh? Oh...”

<b>

I just realized that I was clutching a black sock in my right hand.

It seems I drunkenly asked this fox lady for a sock.

I must have said something about offering it as a sacrifice to the gods, or exchanging it for clothes since I had no money.

(By the way, my universal ID is safely stored in my inventory.)

<b>

“It was surprisingly well-made, so I prepared some second-hand clothes as change. It’s a service. Also, I’ll return your temporary guild certificate; it’s worthless anyway.”

“...Thanks.”

<b>

I put on the second-hand clothes... hmm, they feel a bit stiff. And they’re rubbing against me a lot.

Ugh, and there’s something strange around my waist, no, between my legs... Huh, I thought my chastity was safe?

<b>

“Oh, are you okay? Sorry, I didn’t know it was your first time.”

“Huh?”

<b>

Harumikazuchi chuckled softly.

Ah, umm. So?

<b>

“Are you saying my first time was with you, Harumikazuchi-san?!”

“Yeah, I feel a bit bad about that—”

“I did it—!!!”

<b>

Goodbye unicorn! Virgin hunters, be gone!

Hello, bicorn! I look forward to a long relationship from now on!!

<b>

To graduate with such a beautiful lady as my first is the best!!

Another world is the best—!!! Thank you, gods—!!!

<b>

“Oh, but I don’t remember anything because I was drunk! Noooo—!!!”

“...Was that really your true self yesterday?”

<b>

It seems I also caused a ruckus with this energy last night.

<b>

“Um, by the way, what exactly happened...?”

“Hm? Oh, well, our place has a bar on the first floor, and there’s a stage there... (mumbles)... and then...”

“Wha... you did something so embarrassing!?”

“Thinking back, I also did something outrageous... ah, how embarrassing.”

<b>

What a disaster I was yesterday! Alcohol is scary!!

But thanks to that, I got to be with such a beautiful lady... damn it, memories, come back to me!

<b>

Ugh, ugh, I can’t remember anything... what a waste.

...I need to drink in moderation.

<b>

<b>

“Oh, by the way, my clothes were a gift from someone important to me... I won’t ask you to return them, but can I say goodbye to them one last time?”

“Hm? That’s fine.”

<b>

Saying that, Harumikazuchi brought my clothes to me. It could be said that this was a part of me, created by the gods along with this body.

I hugged them tightly. I embraced them.

<b>

“Thank you for everything... I won’t forget you!”

<b>

Even if I hid it with my body, yes, a copy was born in my storage space.

Then I swapped the original with the copy.

<b>

Wow, it’s such well-made clothing. I can’t help it. Wearing stiff clothes feels uncomfortable.

I’ll change back later.
