# Is she an angel? She was an angel.

I’m Karina-chan. I received a quest from God: “Obtain the socks of a beautiful woman (with a sense of shame)!”

That God must be a pervert, right? I can’t say it out loud, though.

<b>

Also, it seems like there’s a bomb of sorts planted in my body, so I want to deliver the socks quickly and secure my private space.

Why do I have to worry about such perverted things…? Is this the price of power…? It seems there really was no power without a price…

<b>

<b>

“Um, are you okay?”

“Ah, yes, I’m fine, Sister.”

<b>

Before I knew it, I had returned to the church’s chapel, sitting on the front pew.

The socks of Harumi Kazuchi-onee-sama had disappeared from my hands, and I felt a gentle flow of time in the storage space. That was undoubtedly proof that I had encountered God.

<b>

“If you’d like, why not lie down and rest in the break room—oh, you’re a fellow practitioner. What a shame. May peace be upon the world.”

“Pardon? Ah, yes.”

<b>

The succubus sister peered into my eyes, then suddenly changed her attitude and stepped away. It seems she approached me because she was after my socks. I see, she is beautiful after all.

<b>

…The moment I properly looked into the pink eyes of the sister, I felt, “Ah, she’s one of my kind.” Hmm, it’s a bit of a strange sensation.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, my business with God this time is done. I left the church—ah, the sunset is beautiful—and then I turned back to the church. I called out to the sister from earlier.

<b>

“Excuse me, fellow practitioner. Actually, I don’t have any money… Can I borrow a blanket or something?”

“Well, normally I’d want to receive donations for that… but I can lend you the break room for a night. However, I can’t provide dinner, okay?”

“Oh! Thank you very much!”

<b>

Having comrades with a base is incredibly reassuring!

Helping each other out is important. Once I become a merchant and earn some money, I’ll make a lot of donations to the church.

<b>

After a night, I woke up alone to the morning chirping of birds.

Since I was kindly lent the break room (and I still haven’t set up my storage space), I woke up wrapped in a warm blanket.

<b>

“...Time to get up.”

<b>

I got out from the blanket. Hmm, should I copy this blanket? Since it’s a copy for personal use and not for sale, is it safe? But since I’m just borrowing it and it’s not my property, is it out? Hmm…

Let’s say it’s safe! I couldn’t resist the warm blanket…!

<b>

So, one more blanket has been added to the storage space. Oh no, I just came in without thinking.

The blanket is quite large. It’s the biggest one I’ve copied so far.

<b>

As I sat down for a moment while hugging the blanket, my stomach growled.

Last night, I tried nibbling on some jerky, but it was too salty and hard, and I couldn’t eat it well.

I really felt how much research had gone into jerky in my previous life…

<b>

Basic knowledge indicated that it should be shaved with a knife and added to soup. I should have checked that sooner… sniff.

<b>

<b>

There was a knock on the door of the room.

<b>

“Are you awake?”

“Yes!”

<b>

It’s the sister. I lightly folded the blanket and opened the door.

When I opened the door, the sister was holding a tray. On it were a small piece of bread and vegetable soup. My throat swallowed hard.

<b>

“Here you go, breakfast.”

“Eh, but you said there wouldn’t be any food?”

“Well, we had dinner prepared last night, you see. I can at least provide breakfast. We’re comrades, right?”

<b>

Damn, is she an angel? She was an angel. Even though she’s a succubus.

<b>

…Thinking about it, religion is all about mutual aid, isn’t it?

In Japan, I was non-religious (though I practiced Buddhism), but it’s really nice to have an organization that helps you just because you believe in the same God. No wonder I end up believing.

<b>

“...Once I earn some money, I’ll make a big donation!”

“I’ll be waiting without expectations.”

“You can expect it, you know? I’ve received various gifts from God.”

“In that case, I can expect it. Please donate a large gold coin as a deferred payment.”

“Oh? You said it, didn’t you? I’ll do it, you know? In the future, though.”

“Well, you don’t have any money right now, do you? Please accept the church’s charity.”

<b>

The sister winked with a snap. Oh no, I might fall in love.

…Wait, is this lovey-dovey feeling also a trap planted in my body? Ah, but this happiness in front of such a cute girl is unbearable! I love it! I want to be hugged by that chubby body and feel the pressure! Does she have a devilish tail or something!?

<b>

“...Please don’t get aroused by me, okay? I can tell when that happens.”

“Ugh!”

<b>

Succubi are terrifying…!
