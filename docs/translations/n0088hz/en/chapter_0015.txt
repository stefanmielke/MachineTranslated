# Angels. I was an angel.

My name is Karina. I received the quest "Get the socks of a beautiful woman (with a sense of shame)" from God!

I mean, God is a weirdo, right?　I can't say it out loud.

<blank>

Also, I would like to deliver the socks as soon as possible to secure my private space, as it seems that my body has been planted with some kind of bomb.

Why should I bother my head about this perverse ...... thing?　After all, there was no such thing as power without a cost. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Um, are you okay?"

Ha, oh, it's all right, Sister."

<blank>

I found myself back in the church chapel, on the front couch.

The socks of Sister Harumikazuchi had disappeared from her hands, and there was a sense that the flow of time in the storage space could be slowed down. This was definitely evidence of a chance encounter with God.

<blank>

I'm sorry to hear that you are in the same business. Too bad. May the world be at peace.

Yes?　Oh, yes."

<blank>

The succubus sister looked into my eyes, changed her attitude and moved away. Apparently, the reason she approached me was to get my socks. I see, she is a beautiful woman, isn't she?

<blank>

...... I could also feel 'Oh, we are the same kind' the moment I looked firmly into Sister's pink eyes. Hmmm, a bit strange feeling.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, this time my business with God was done. I left the church - ah, the sunset is so beautiful - and turned back to the church after all. I called out to the sister from earlier.

<blank>

I'm sorry, sir. Actually, I don't have any money. ...... Can I borrow a blanket or something?"

I'd like to get a donation for that kind of thing. ...... Well, I'll at least rent you a break room for the night. But we can't provide dinner, can we?"

Oh," she said!　Thank you!"

<blank>

Comrades with a base are very reliable, aren't they?

Helping each other is so important. I will donate a lot of money to the church when I become a merchant and earn money.

<blank>

After a night of sleep, I slept alone in the morning.

I was allowed to rest in the break room since I had been given the opportunity to rent it (and I haven't even made room for storage space yet), and I wake up with a warm blanket wrapped around me.

<blank>

I wonder if ...... will happen."

<blank>

I'm getting out of the blanket. Woo, I think I'll make a copy of this blanket. Is it safe because it's a copy for myself and not for sale?　Is it out because I'm borrowing it and it's not my property?　Nn......

Safe!　I couldn't beat a warm blanket. ......

<blank>

So one blanket was added to the storage space. Oh, shit, I'm flustered.

The blanket, it's pretty big. It's the biggest one I've ever copied.

<blank>

And as I sit down to rest for a bit with a blanket in my arms, my stomach rumbles with a coo.

I tried biting into some dried meat last night, but it was too salty and tough to eat properly.

I could feel in my bones how much research was done on jerky in my previous life. ......

<blank>

Basic Knowledge had a way to eat it, but apparently it was something that should be scraped off with a knife or something and eaten in the soup. I should have checked sooner. ......

<blank>

<blank>

There was a knock at the door of the room.

<blank>

Are you awake?"

Yes."

<blank>

It's Sister. I folded the blanket lightly and opened the door.

When I opened the door, Sister was holding a tray. On it was a small loaf of bread and vegetable soup. I gulped.

<blank>

Here you go. Breakfast is served.

What, I thought you weren't serving rice?"

I was already ready to serve dinner last night. I'll at least serve you breakfast. You're one of us, right?"

<blank>

Damn, an angel. It was an angel. A succubus, though.

<blank>

...... If you think about it, religion is this kind of mutual aid.

In Japan, I had no religion (although I was a Buddhist), but I was very grateful to have an organization that would help me by recognizing me as a fellow believer just because we share the same God. I would have believed in them.

<blank>

"......I'll donate a whole bunch of money when I make some of it!"

I'll be waiting with baited breath.

I'm not going to get my hopes up there, okay?　God has given me a lot of things."

"Then you can count on me. Please donate at least a large gold coin to pay for my career."

Oh?　You said that?　I'm going to do it.　In the future."

'Well, you don't have any money right now, do you?　Take some alms from the church."

<blank>

Sister winking at me with a "snap". I'm going to fall in love with her.

...... is it possible that this kind of infatuation is also a trap set by my body?　Ah, but the euphoria in front of this pretty girl is unbearable!　I love it!　I want to be hugged and squeezed by that whipped body!　I wonder if she has a devilish tail or something!

<blank>

"...... a little bit. Don't go into heat on me, okay?　I know that kind of thing."

Ugh!"

<blank>

Succubus Fear: ......!
