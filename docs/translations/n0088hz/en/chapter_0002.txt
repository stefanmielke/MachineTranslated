# God said, "This is a tutorial, right?" (●Illustration included)

(I started this as a break. Nice to meet you.)

----------------

<b>

<b>

"Ah ha ha ha!! What do you mean 'I am the God of Chaos'? Pathetic!!! The real deal is much more impressive!!!"

"Hiieeeee!?"

<b>

Saying that, I—no, I wasn't me, I was… no, it wasn't like that either.

The 'real god' using my body was slowly, really slowly, dismantling the old man who called himself the 'God of Chaos' as if breaking down a LEGO block structure and returning it to its original blocks.

<b>

It's not a metaphor. From the tips of his limbs, he was being crumbled into small blocks without a drop of blood flowing. His right arm was already completely shattered near the shoulder.

This must be the spatial magic bestowed upon me.

<b>

<b>

The location was an extravagant temple. The self-proclaimed God of Chaos, now without arms, was an old man adorned with shiny decorations. And tormenting that old man was a seemingly ordinary villager, a girl with straight black hair—me.

The old man's eyes, which had initially been lewdly fixated on my chest, now reflected nothing but confusion and fear.

<b>

The old man tried to gather the scattered flesh-colored and red blocks on the floor with his remaining left arm.

But my leg mercilessly kicked him away. He flew as lightly as a soccer ball, crashing into a pillar of the temple with a "Gueh!" scream.

<b>

"Hiya, hiiie, who are you, no, help!"

"Come on, come on, if you're calling yourself the 'God of Chaos', you should be able to fix this easily, right? Huh, you can't? Ah ha ha! Pathetic! Pathetic! Don't pretend to be my 'God of Chaos' with such a level of skill!? Divine punishment will befall you!! Here it comes!!"

<b>

A voice filled with genuine delight came from my mouth. I also dropped the rubble that had been continuously falling and accelerating in the vertical space right next to the old man to surprise him.

<b>

"Gyahhh! Hiiieeeaaah!!!"

"Ah ha ha! Come on, aren't you going to resist? You can if you want!"

"F-fireball!!"

<b>

As the old man shouted, a fireball came flying. However, it was blocked by an invisible wall that fixed the space, preventing it from reaching me.

<b>

"W-waste of effort."

"Telekinesis! ...Why, why isn't it working!?"

"Are you trying something? Ah ha ha!"

<b>

And it seems he had fixed his own body as himself, so he didn't receive any external attacks at all.

This includes weight, so if he tried to lift the rubble in this state, he wouldn't feel its weight, and if he couldn't lift it, it would be the rubble that broke.

Physically invulnerable. A terrifying body enhancement that combines offense and defense.

<b>

When my right hand swung smoothly, the old man's body, which was far away, was cleanly severed at the torso. But again, no blood came out.

<b>

"Hiieee! My body is...!?"

"Ah ha, it's okay, you're not cut because I'm still connecting the space. Well, I could cut you off anytime, though? Ufufu."

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, the severed body returned to its original state.

<b>

"Someone, anyone!!"

"No help is coming! I'm currently dividing the space! Oh, let me restore your arm as well. Duplicate, reverse! Combine!"

<b>

With a clap of my hands, the old man's left arm was duplicated in the empty air, reversed into a right arm. Then, it connected properly down to the blood vessels and nerves, attaching where the right arm had been disassembled.

<b>

Ugh, my head is spinning. This seems to be quite taxing.

<b>

"Oh, are you okay? Since this is a tutorial, I thought I should use as many abilities as possible."

"Did you just say 'just a tutorial', God?"

"Come on, it's perfectly a tutorial, okay?"

<b>

I chuckled at my own internal monologue, and my self replied with a giggle.

No denying that.

<b>

"By duplicating and regenerating the body like this, I can torment you as much as I want. Well, duplicating does use a fair amount of MP, but since this is a tutorial, it's unlimited service! Because it's a tutorial!!"

<b>

Yes, this is merely a tutorial from the god to me.

It is certainly not a punishment for an impudent fool who dared to impersonate the name of the god's lover... well, I guess the self-proclaimed God of Chaos is the final boss I need to defeat...

<b>

"What was that about gods not being allowed to directly influence the world...?"

"If it's to explain how to use power in a tutorial, it's unavoidable!! ...Or was the explanation unnecessary?"

"No! It's unavoidable, sir!"

"I like honest kids. Oh, and I can do this too!"

<b>

Twisting my hand like turning a faucet, the self-proclaimed God of Chaos's arm was twisted and broken. Damn, what a cheat ability...!

And when I realized I couldn't hear the old man's filthy screams anymore, it was because I had completely shut out his voice with spatial magic.

<b>

<b>

"Shall we finally allow some bloodshed? Things are going to get a bit gruesome from here on."

"Ugh."

<b>

Thus, the god took plenty of time to thoroughly destroy the self-proclaimed God of Chaos.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

—Now, let's recall how this situation came to be.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Originally, I... was supposed to be an adult man living in Japan.

I wasn't hit by a truck from another world or anything; I just found myself in what seemed to be the divine realm.

<b>

A white world. In front of me stood a girl with black hair and golden eyes, smiling brightly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Welcome! Suddenly, I will transfer you to the world I manage... or rather, I guess it's reincarnation since I will be reconstructing your body! You will be going to another world!"

"…Huh?"

"Yes, you just got lucky. If you had suddenly said, 'What are you doing! This is kidnapping! Apologize!' and resisted, I would have erased you. Congratulations! You chose your words better than the last person!"

<b>

The girl clapped her hands.

...It seems the last person was erased.

<b>

"I will grant you power. And I have something I want you to do."

"Y-yes."

"Good, you're obedient. Oh, I am the God of Time and Space. A real god, you know."

<b>

Saying that, the god continued explaining.

<b>

"There is a fool in the world I'm sending you to who calls himself a 'god', so please defeat him."

"…A god, huh?"

"A self-proclaimed god. He sprouted while I was neglecting things for a bit, so I thought I would show him the power of a real god. However, due to certain restrictions, I need to prepare a reincarnator like you."

<b>

It seems it's permissible for the god to lend power to someone rather than act directly.

I see, a typical god-like restriction. That means the god in that world is indeed a self-proclaimed one.

<b>

"The reward is a free life in this world. Feel free to engage in trade, become a hero, or indulge in pleasures with the power granted to you."

"Um... is that really okay? Can I do anything?"

"You can even call yourself a god if you want; being my apostle would make you equivalent to a lower god."

<b>

Isn't it forbidden to name the target? I tilted my head.

<b>

"No, it's fine to call yourself a god. However, there is one name I can't overlook."

"Huh, um, so what is this name I can't overlook?"

"Yes. 'God of Chaos'!"

<b>

That name seems to be a no-go word for the god in front of me.

<b>

"So I just need to find and defeat this God of Chaos, right?"

"You're quick to understand. That's exactly it. ...Oh, the body is ready."

<b>

As the god snapped her fingers, a woman who looked about 18 years old, resembling the god in front of me, stood there. She had straight black hair, dark eyes, and a slightly plain but cute appearance. She also had quite a chest.

<b>

"Wait, I'm a man, though?"

"My preference—cough. For the sake of granting you power, it's easier to make you resemble me."

"I swear you just said 'preference'!?"

"If you have complaints, I'll erase you. It's true that it's easier this way. Oh, since it's going to be your body, you can grope my breasts and do even more amazing things, okay? Right?"

<b>

I fell silent. In that case, it would be me, not my body, that would be erased.

I wasn't particularly drawn to the idea of groping breasts.

<b>

"Now, I will grant you spatial magic, basic knowledge, and a talent that makes it easier to acquire skills as a bonus."

"Ah, thank you."

"And as an additional service, I will demonstrate how to use my power in this body as a tutorial. This is a limited-time offer for your unused partner, you know?"

"Wh-what, I'm not a virgin!—cough. Yes, nice to meet you."

<b>

Thus, I became 'me' and descended into another world.

<b>

<b>

"Now, the tutorial opponent is the 'God of Chaos'. Here we go♪"

"Huh?"

<b>

<b>

Thus, we return to the beginning.
