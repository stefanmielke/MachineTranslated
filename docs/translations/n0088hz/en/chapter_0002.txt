# God said. 'This is a tutorial, okay?' (●Illustration Ali)

（I started this site just to take a break. I'm glad to have you here.)

What is "I am the God of Chaos"?　What is this, "I am the God of Chaos"?　I'm the God of Chaos!　The real one is even better!

Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

I said that, and I - I wasn't, I was ...... no, it wasn't like this.

The "real God" who is using my body is taking apart the old man who called himself the "God of Chaos" little by little, really little by little, like dismantling an object made of LEG○ blocks and putting it back together into blocks.

<blank>

It's not a metaphor. From the ends of the limbs, they are being crumbled into small blocks with no blood flowing at all. The right arm has already been completely disintegrated into pieces up to near the shoulder.

This must be the work of spatial magic given to me.

<blank>

<blank>

The place is an opulent temple. The self-proclaimed god of chaos, who has no arms, is an old man wearing glittering ornaments. And I, a girl with straight black hair, a seemingly ordinary villager, am the one who torments the old man.

The old man's eyes, which at first had gazed at my breasts with skeptical eyes, now reflected nothing but confusion and fright.

<blank>

The old man tries to scramble up the skin-colored and red blocks scattered on the floor with his remaining left arm.

My leg kicked it so hard that I thought it was a soccer ball. It flew so lightly that I thought it was a soccer ball and hit a pillar of the temple. I screamed.

<blank>

"Hi, hi, hi, hi, who are you, no, save me!"

"Look, look, if you call yourself the 'God of Chaos,' you can fix this easily, can't you?　Oh, you can't?　Ha-ha-ha!　Zaako!　Zaako!　Don't you dare to deceive my "God of Chaos" with that level of skill!　You will be punished by the gods!　Yes-doooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

A hearty sound of enjoyment comes out of my mouth. In addition, I surprised the old man by dropping the debris, which had been free-falling and accelerating by connecting the space above and below from a while ago, right next to him.

<blank>

Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!　Hiiiiiiiiiaaaaah!!!!"

Hahahaha!　See, you don't resist?　You may do so!"

"Huh, fireball!"

<blank>

When the old man shouts this, a fireball comes flying. But it is blocked by an invisible wall that holds the space in place and does not reach him.

<blank>

Well, it's no use."

Telekinesis! ...... Why, why doesn't it work aaaaah!"

Are you doing something?　Ha-ha-ha."

<blank>

And his own body is also fixed as his own, and he does not accept any external attack.

This includes weight and other factors, so if you lift the debris in this state, you can lift it without feeling the weight, and if you cannot lift it, it is the debris that breaks.

Physical self-discipline. It's a vicious physical enhancement that is both offensive and defensive.

<blank>

My right hand swung quickly, and the old man's body, which was far away from me, parted at the torso with a snap. But this also did not draw blood.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to do!　My body is ahhh......!"

Haha, it's okay, I haven't cut it yet because I'm still connecting the space. Well, I can always disconnect it, right?　Uh-huh."

<blank>

With a snap of the fingers, the divided body returns to its original state.

<blank>

Somebody, somebody!

'No help is coming - we're in a spatial divide right now!　Oops, let's put the arms back on too. Duplicate, invert!　Combined!"

<blank>

With a clap of the hand, the old man's left arm was duplicated in the air where there was none, flipped and became the right arm. It was then attached in place of the right arm, which had been disassembled, in the form of a firm connection all the way down to the blood vessels and nerves.

<blank>

Gosh, I'm really messing up my head. This seems to be quite a load.

<blank>

I'm sorry, are you all right?　It's just a tutorial, so I thought I'd try to use as many of my abilities as possible."

Did you just say just in case, God?"

'Oh no, it's a perfect tutorial, right?'

<blank>

He responds with a chuckle as I chuckled to him as he rushed into my brain.

There is no doubt about it.

<blank>

It's possible to duplicate and reproduce the body in this way to inflict as much pain as you want. Well, duplication uses a certain amount of MP, but now it's a tutorial, so it's an unlimited use service!　It's a tutorial!

<blank>

Yes, this is just a tutorial to me by God.

It is never a sanction against an infidel who cheated the name of God's Koibito. ...... No, well, the self-proclaimed god of chaos is the rascally one I have to defeat. ......

<blank>

'What was that about God not directly influencing the world: ......'

'If you're going to explain how to use force in a tutorial, I don't blame you! ...... or did you not need an explanation?"

'No, sir!　I have no choice, sir!

I like honest girls. Oh, you can do this too, you know?"

<blank>

With a snap, he turned his hand as if twisting a faucet, and the arm of the self-proclaimed god of chaos was twisted and broken, ignoring perspective. Damn, what a cheat ability ......!

And when I thought I couldn't hear the old man's dirty screams from halfway through, this too was completely shut out by spatial magic to shut out the voices.

<blank>

<blank>

Then I'm going to start bleeding. It's a little grotesque from here."

Yuck."

<blank>

And so, God took plenty of time to thoroughly destroy the old man, the self-proclaimed god of chaos.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

-- Now, let's recollect why this is happening.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Originally I ...... was supposed to be an adult male living in Japan.

It wasn't that I was hit by a truck, but I found myself in a world of gods.

<blank>

A white world. In front of me was a dark-haired, blonde-eyed girl smiling at me.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Welcome!　Suddenly, you are transferred to a world under my control. ...... I'm going to create a new body for you, so you will be reincarnated?　Well, you're going to another world!

'...... eh?"

'Yes, now you have saved your life. Here's where I said, 'What are you doing all of a sudden?　It's an abduction!　Apologize!" and if you had disobeyed me, I would have erased you. Congratulations!　You chose your words better than the last guy!"

<blank>

A girl claps her hands, crackling.

...... I heard the guy before me was erased.

<blank>

Let me give you the power. And there's something I need you to do."

Yes.

You may be honest. Oh, I am the space-time god. I am a god. A real one, you know."

<blank>

Then God continues his explanation.

<blank>

There is a fool who calls himself 'God' in the world we are sending you to, and you must defeat him."

'...... God, is it?"

I call myself a god. I've been neglecting it for a while and it grew back, so I thought I'd show you the power of a real god. But I can't do it directly, so I have to prepare a reincarnated person.

<blank>

I heard that it is possible for God to make someone else do it, not directly, but with the help of someone else.

I see, it is a God-like constraint. So, God in that world must really be self-proclaimed.

<blank>

The reward is a life of freedom in this world. Use the power we have given you to become a merchant, a hero, or enjoy the pleasures of the world as you please."

'Um, ...... is that okay?　What can I do?"

You can call yourself God if you want, but being my apostle makes you the equivalent of a lower god."

<blank>

Even though the target is not supposed to be named?　He nods his head.

<blank>

No, it's fine to call yourself a god. It's just that there is one whose name I can't overlook for a moment."

'Huh, uh, let's see. So, that can't-be-overlooked thing is...'

Yes. The God of Chaos!"

<blank>

That name seems to be the NG word for the god in front of me.

<blank>

"So you're saying, 'We have to find this god of chaos and defeat him.

'I like that you understand so quickly. That's what I mean. ...... more, I've got a body."

<blank>

And when God snapped his fingers, there stood a woman who looked like she was about 18 years old, the God in front of him. She has straight black hair, dark eyes, and round eyes that give her a slightly plain look, but upon closer inspection she is a cute type of girl. She also has quite a few breasts.

<blank>

I'm a guy, you know?"

My taste--gasp. For the convenience of giving you power, it's easier to do it if you look like me."

You just said it was a hobby!"

If you have a problem with it, I'll turn it off. It's true that it's easy to do. Oh, and since it's going to be your body, you can rub my boobs and do even more amazing things with it, right?　Right?

<blank>

I shut up. In that case, it would be me, not my body, that would be erased.

I wasn't attracted by the unlimited titty rubbing.

<blank>

I'll give you spatial magic, basic knowledge, and a talent that will make it easier for you to learn skills in the service."

Oh, thank you."

And as a further service, I'll show you how I actually use my powers on that body as a tutorial. In honor of your unused partner, this is a first-time-only offer, okay?"

I'm not a virgin! --I'm not a virgin! Yes, please.

<blank>

Thus, I became me and descended into another world.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, our tutorial partner is the "God of Chaos". I'm off!

"Eh."

<blank>

<blank>

Thus, we return to the beginning.

<blank>
