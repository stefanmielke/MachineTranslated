# Reunion with God ●Illustration

<blank>

I'm Karina. I'm in church!

I recognized the white building just as the merchant's brother had said. What a nice place.

<blank>

Miss. Are you here for the church?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Because there are such pink-haired and fleshy sisters!

What is this, a succubus?

Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is going to make young people's sexuality go crazy.

<blank>

I gulped and gulped with fresh saliva at the sight of her soft, well-muscled body.

<blank>

'Uh, well, I thought I'd say a prayer.

Well," he said, "that's very good!　That's very good of you. This way, please."

<blank>

The sisters lead me into the chapel. In front of the chapel is a stained glass window and a wooden altar. The symbol of the chapel is a round circle that looks like a five-yen coin, which was given to me as an identification card.

There was a row of couches facing the front, with a few people here and there.

They say you can pray wherever you want ...... Some people sleep on couches.

<blank>

Are you sure you want to do this, sir?

That is also a form of prayer, a kyouchi. If you snore too loudly, I will stop you."

I see.

<blank>

If that's a prayer, I guess I can be a devout believer too.

With that thought in mind, I somehow sat down in the chair at the front of the room.

<blank>

Well, how do I give the tribute to God?　For now, I'm going to take out Sister Harumikazuchi's socks from the storage space.

<blank>

<blank>

Then, in an instant, the space feels repainted.

I found myself in a space as starry as the night sky. In an invisible chair I sat.

It looks different from the white space where I met God before, but in front of me is a girl with black hair and blond eyes, God.

<blank>

Hello, hello, welcome Karina!　We've been waiting for you, now give us a sock!"

Ah-hai."

<blank>

When I handed him a sock I had with me at his prompt request, he happily held up the sock and sniffed it. and then gently sniffed the sock.

<blank>

Hmmm, this slight smell of incense. It's very good, just like a lady of the night. Let's enjoy the taste later.

<blank>

God carefully put away the socks in the storage space.

I think I heard a perverse review and future plans that don't match the looks, but maybe I'm imagining it. I'd like to think it's just my imagination.

<blank>

"...... By the way, why the socks?"

Socks are the closest thing to a person's feet that hold everything about them. So a sock is filled with information about the person, a part of his/her life. God is an information-eating ecology, so it's a very suitable tribute!"

<blank>

It was a surprisingly decent reason.

...... No, if it were sane, I wouldn't have reviewed it earlier. It seems to be a bit of an afterthought.

<blank>

The better tribute is freshly removed socks that have been worn so long or so muddy that it's embarrassing to wear them!　I hope to see more of those in the future!"

<blank>

Oh, this is a hobby after all. God is a pervert: ......

<blank>

Yes?"

Yenang Demo."

<blank>

God smiling at us. If it weren't for her perversity, she would look like a very pretty girl, but perhaps this perversity is what makes God God God.

<blank>

Oh, yes. Currently, we didn't add time manipulation to Karina's storage space, did we? This means that even if you store freshly removed socks, they will get cold, so I will allow you to set a time delay from 1x to 0x within the storage space only. It's special, okay?"

"Wow, that's nice."

<blank>

For some stupid reason, spatial magic has been powered up, oi.

Zero times, that means you can stop time.

<blank>

Hmm?　But I thought you said time magic was forbidden? I'll have to go to ...... and make sure they don't find out.

<blank>

I want to eat fresh food, after all. Seafood and such won't spoil if you put it in there, right?　You can always eat all the fresh fish you want if you stop time and copy what you've saved!"

Oh, that might be a sobering thought."

I'm sure you'll agree.　Also, you can use it to store and save magic and stuff, and use it elsewhere. Magic tube, modified!"

<blank>

...... God, could it be that you've gotten a tremendous power boost?

<blank>

"...... is this power really a good thing to use ......?"

It's okay if it's only this bad.

<blank>

It's so powerful that it can one-sidedly full-bore the self-proclaimed chaos god who created the nation, but for God, it's "this much".

<blank>

Just to add a point of clarification. I really like the idea of setting some limits on the duplication of spatial magic. I commend you for that spirit of empowerment. ......, so please accept my best wishes."

I would have nodded my head honestly if it weren't for that last bit." ...... procedurally, is it?"

I'm being honest and genuine, too."

<blank>

Mm, I see. Then--

<blank>

How did you know I was going to limit the use of spatial magic?"

There are altars dedicated to me in guilds, stores, and even at gates. There are altars in guilds, shops, and at the gates. But I can only hear the strong feelings of determination and so on.

<blank>

Also, since I myself am an apostle, it seems I am easy to pay attention to. I heard that he was watching me perfectly from the simple altar at the Shunrai Pavilion at the time of the Hajimete. How wonderful.

<blank>

"I'm sorry about that ...... something. I'm ...... with the body you gave me."

I'm fine. My body was made with such a strong desire, so it's only natural if I got drunk and lost my control. I'd rather be drunk and do more of it.

Um, God?

Because that increases the possibility of getting various socks that are more interesting ...... and ...... hobby. Please keep up the good work. It seems that my sock lust is functioning properly, as I would expect from someone who modeled their body after mine."

Um?　God?"

My Apostle, God is always watching over you. ......!"

<blank>

It seems he has gotten tired of trying to mend things. This god is too free.

And you want socks. You don't have that built into your instincts, do you?　That's terrible: ......

<blank>

<blank>

But there are times when you want to sneak away from my eyes, aren't there?　Prepare for rebellion."

I don't have any plans to ...... do that, but I strongly feel now that I want my privacy."

Here's one for you!　Mr. Koshori!"

<blank>

Bang!　and God shows us an egg-like statue with a palm-sized pedestal.

<blank>

If you place this in a room, any god will miss the inside of that room!　In an open area, the effective range is about 10 meters radius!"

Oh!"

Well, if I really wanted to, I could, but except in an emergency, I promise in the name of the god of time and space that I would never look in on Kalina, even if she died inside.

You said, "...... even if I die. On the other hand, what emergency would you peek at?"

I don't think so," he said. I don't think so.

<blank>

This god, I guess I shouldn't touch the lover relationship with a stiffy.

<blank>

So here is my reward for the next time you bring in a pair of socks. We are waiting for your new socks.

'Oh, you won't give it to me now?

If you want it, you have to pay for it. You're going to be a merchant, right?"

<blank>

I can't even hear a peep out of him.

<blank>

"...... can't you just wear my socks?　She's beautiful, in case you were wondering."

No," he said. You know how there are people who draw pictures and say that their own drawings are no good?　It's like that, it's just not good enough."

<blank>

So I can't even deliver a duplicate. The magic power contained in it will be mine, and it will be godly and atrocious.

<blank>

I was lucky to get them this time, but you don't get socks from beautiful women that often. Why not a man's socks or something?"

"Some say it's hard to get, so it's a price to pay. ...... I don't care if it's a sock for a man or an elderly child, there's an overwhelming lack of shame."

Shame.

'Yes, shame is the best spice. A sock without shame is by far the least valuable. And the more beautiful a girl is, the more embarrassed she is to surrender her used socks!　Harumikazuchi-chan seemed quite embarrassed too!　Good!"

<blank>

And God, who is a force to be reckoned with.

He also adds, "It's almost worthless if it's already washed, so be careful there.

I heard that God gets grumpy if you deliver socks of low ...... value. Scary.

<blank>

...... so for the time being, I'm going to go for that succubus-like Sister's socks ......"

'That little succubus is one of my "works". She is not a reincarnated person, but she is a so-called messenger of God, an angel. Her race is succubus, though."

<blank>

Angels are the equivalent of God's hands and feet, and like me, they are judged 'somehow no good.

I mean, if an angel is a succubus, isn't this God the bad one?

<blank>

There is at least one angel in every church in a large town to watch over the churches. They are also Carina's colleagues who provide socks for believers and others. I hope you get along with them."

"A peer."

<blank>

Although I aspire to be a merchant, I don't remember becoming a used sock dealer.

I am not afraid to be friendly with them.

<blank>

Don't be offended if I deliver your socks without realizing they're from ...... angels, okay?"

I'd like to ask you to please check with me in advance so that I can recognize each other's eyes if we are among my dependents."

Uh, yes.

<blank>

Such a system. Wow, convenient?

<blank>

Well, it's time for me to go. We look forward to seeing you again, Adeju Noshi."

Eh, ah, yes. Adeju?"

<blank>

That's why I said "noshi". God, this world doesn't seem to be Japanese.　God, you have a lot of knowledge about other worlds, don't you?

<blank>

<blank>

(I heard that Kakuyom has become sexually explicit, but we are perfectly safe because we are socks.)
