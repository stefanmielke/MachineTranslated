# Reuniting with God ●Illustrations Included

<b>

I am Karina. Right now, I'm at the church!

Just as the merchant brother said, I recognized it immediately because of the white building. What a lovely place this is.

<b>

"Miss, do you have business at the church?"

<b>

Because there’s such a well-endowed sister with pink hair here!

What is this, a succubus?

Hey now. This is going to warp the young people's preferences.

<b>

I couldn't help but swallow hard as I gazed at her curvy, soft-looking body.

<b>

"Ah, um, I was thinking of praying."

"Oh my! That's a very good intention. Please come this way."

<b>

Guided by the sister, I entered the chapel. In front of me was a wooden altar with stained glass. It seemed like a round symbol resembling a five-yen coin I received as identification.

There were pews lined up facing forward, and I could see a few people scattered about.

It seems I can pray wherever I like... some people are even sleeping on the pews.

<b>

"Is that allowed?"

"That's another form of prayer, a type of 'Mu no Kyouchi.' If their snoring gets too loud, I'll stop them, though."

"I see?"

<b>

If that counts as prayer, I might be able to become a devout believer too.

Thinking that, I somehow found myself sitting in the front pew.

<b>

Um, how should I offer my tribute to God? For now, I take out the socks of my older sister Harumikazuchi from my storage space.

<b>

<b>

Then, I felt a sensation as if the space was being repainted in an instant.

Before I knew it, I was in a starry space resembling the night sky. I was sitting on an invisible chair.

It seemed different from the white space where I met God before, but in front of me was a girl with black hair and golden eyes—God.

<b>

"Hey, hey, welcome, Karina-chan! I've been waiting for you, so please give me the socks!"

"Ah, okay!"

<b>

As I handed over the socks at her prompt, God joyfully raised them and then gently sniffed them.

<b>

"Mm, this faint scent of incense. It feels like a night sister, very good. I'll savor the taste later."

<b>

God carefully stored the socks in her storage space.

I felt like I heard a bizarre review that didn't match her appearance and some future plans, but it was probably just my imagination. I want to believe it's just my imagination.

<b>

"By the way, why socks?"

"Socks are the closest thing to the feet that support a person entirely. Therefore, socks contain information about that person, a part of their life. Since God feeds on information, they are very suitable as a tribute!"

<b>

That was surprisingly reasonable.

...No, if it were reasonable, there wouldn't be that earlier review. It feels like a post hoc justification.

<b>

"Socks that have been worn for a long time to the point of being embarrassing or sweaty make the best offerings! I hope to see more of those in the future!"

<b>

Ah, this is definitely a hobby. God is such a pervert...

<b>

"What is it?"

"Nothing at all."

<b>

God smiled sweetly. If it weren't for her perverted nature, she would just look like a very cute girl, but perhaps this perverted nature is what makes her a God.

<b>

"Ah, right. I haven't granted time manipulation to your storage space yet. If you store worn socks, they would go stale. So, I'll set it up so you can have a time delay setting from 1x to 0x within the storage space. It's special, you know?"

"Wow, that's great!"

<b>

Somehow, this space magic has been powered up for a trivial reason.

Zero times means I can stop time, right?

<b>

Huh? But didn’t they say time magic was forbidden? ...I need to make sure it doesn't get found out.

<b>

"After all, I want to eat fresh things. If I put seafood in there, it won't spoil, right? If I stop time to preserve it and copy it, I can have fresh fish anytime!"

"Oh, that might be nice."

"Right? You can also store and preserve magic to use elsewhere. It's a magic tube, improved!"

<b>

...God, did you just get an incredible power-up?

<b>

"...Is this power really okay to use?"

"At this level, it's fine. Even if civilization were to fall, it can be rebuilt."

<b>

It's power enough to completely beat up a self-proclaimed chaotic god who created a nation, but for God, it's just "this level."

<b>

"I should mention that I was thinking of imposing some restrictions on the duplication of space magic, which is very commendable. This power-up is a reward for that spirit... so please take care of it."

"If you hadn't added that last line, I could have nodded honestly... Is it for procedural reasons?"

"It's also my honest opinion."

<b>

Hmm, is that so? Then—

<b>

"Wait, how did you know I was trying to impose restrictions on the use of space magic?"

"There are altars where I am worshiped in guilds, shops, and gates, so my voice can reach there easily. What I can hear are strong feelings like determination."

<b>

Also, it seems I am easily noticed because I am a disciple. Apparently, she was watching me perfectly from a simple altar at Shunrai-tei during my first time. Kyaa.

<b>

"I'm sorry about that... with this body I received..."

"It's okay. This body was made with strong desires, so if you got drunk and lost control, that's only natural. Rather, I feel full of the desire for more."

"Um, God?"

"Because that way it's more interesting... the possibility of obtaining various socks increases... it's a hobby. I look forward to it. It seems the sock desire is functioning well, as expected of a model based on my body."

"Um? God?"

"My disciple, God is always watching over you...!"

<b>

It seems she got tired of pretending. This God is too free.

And sock desire, really? Did you incorporate that into her instincts? That's terrible...

<b>

<b>

"However, there are times when I want to sneak away from my watchful eyes, right? Like preparing for rebellion."

"...I don't have any such plans, but I strongly feel that I want privacy right now."

"For you, here it is! The Sneaky-kun!"

<b>

Ta-da! God shows me a palm-sized egg-like statue with a pedestal.

<b>

"If you place this in your room, no God will overlook what happens in that room! In an open space, its effective range is about a 10m radius!"

"Oh wow!"

"Well, if I really wanted to peek, I could, but unless it's an emergency, I promise in the name of the time-space God that I will never peek even if Karina-chan dies inside."

"...Even if I die? What kind of emergency would make you peek?"

"Like if I hadn't heard from you for about ten years or if my lover came to visit. But I don't think that's going to happen."

<b>

It seems best to avoid touching on the topic of God’s romantic relationships.

<b>

"So, the reward for the next time you bring socks is this. I'm looking forward to new socks."

"Wait, you're not giving it to me now!?"

"If you want it, pay the price. You're becoming a merchant, right?"

<b>

I can't even make a sound.

<b>

"...Are my socks not good enough? I'm a beauty, you know?"

"They're no good. There are people who feel it's not right to use their own drawings, right? It's that kind of feeling, so it's just not right."

<b>

So, delivering duplicates is also not allowed. The magical power contained would become mine, and that would be a letdown for God.

<b>

"I was lucky to obtain them this time, but it's not easy to get a beauty's socks. How about a man's socks?"

"While it's true that the difficulty of obtaining them makes them valuable... men's, old men's, or children's socks are fine, but they lack overwhelming embarrassment."

"Embarrassment?"

"Yes, embarrassment is the best spice. Socks without embarrassment are overwhelmingly low in value. And it's more embarrassing for beauties to part with their used socks! Harumikazuchi-chan seemed quite embarrassed too! Good!"

<b>

God passionately explains.

Also, she adds, "Washed socks are practically worthless, so please be careful about that."

...It seems that delivering low-value socks would make God unhappy. How terrifying.

<b>

"...Then, for now, I'll aim for the socks of that succubus-like sister..."

"That succubus is one of my 'works.' She's not a reincarnator, but a so-called divine messenger, an angel. Her race is succubus, though."

<b>

Angels are also equivalent to God's arms and legs, so it seems they also get a "not quite right" judgment like me.

Wait, is this God really a bad kind of God since an angel is a succubus?

<b>

"To monitor the church, there is usually at least one angel in larger towns' churches. They also provide socks from believers and are your colleagues, Karina-chan. Please get along with them."

"Colleagues?"

<b>

While I aim to be a merchant, I don't remember becoming a second-hand sock dealer.

I'm not opposed to getting along, though.

<b>

"...Please don't get angry if I deliver socks without realizing they're from an angel, okay?"

"My followers can tell by looking into each other's eyes, so please check beforehand."

"Ah, okay."

<b>

Such a system exists. Wow, how convenient?

<b>

"Well then, it's about time. I look forward to your next visit. Adieu-no-shi."

"Eh, ah, okay. Adieu?"

<b>

So it's 'no-shi.' God, this world doesn't seem to be in Japanese, does it? You're quite knowledgeable about other worlds, God.

(It seems Kakuyomu has become strict about sexual expressions, but we're safe since it's about socks.)
