# No matter what

<b>

I received an all-purpose fake ID from God and was able to enter the town safely.

However, I can't keep using hypnosis every time, so I need to quickly obtain a proper ID.

I need to launder my ID.

<b>

Thus, I came to the Merchant Guild. It is a large square stone building.

Upon entering, I felt a bustling atmosphere. Hmm, the noise of business negotiations really feels like a merchant's place.

I approached the receptionist at the general counter.

<b>

"Um, I would like to get a guild certificate, what should I do...?"

"Are you a new member? Then you'll need your ID and a guild membership fee of 25 silver coins."

"Oh, I'm sorry, I'll come back later."

<b>

I have the ID from God, but I realized I have no money.

Money...

<b>

In terms of the story, if I want to earn from nothing, the Adventurer Guild is the way to go.

Using space magic, hunting monsters would be a breeze. After all, I could easily beat up a self-proclaimed chaos god.

<b>

Basic knowledge also says that if you have strength, you can earn in the Adventurer Guild.

Being both an adventurer and a merchant doesn't seem to be particularly rare for peddlers.

<b>

Moreover, it seems that at the Adventurer Guild, you can pay the registration fee later.

<b>

"…First, I'll register at the Adventurer Guild, earn a bit, and then go to the Merchant Guild."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, I came to the Adventurer Guild this time.

It is a wooden building that looks like a tavern. Apparently, it also serves as a tavern.

<b>

Upon entering, I felt the gazes of others on me. Mainly on my chest. Hey, you guys, it's obvious. Staring like that makes it even more noticeable.

<b>

Fortunately, I wasn't bothered and went straight to the counter.

I spoke to the receptionist.

<b>

"Excuse me, I would like to become an adventurer."

"Understood. Then you'll need your ID and a registration fee of 5 large copper coins. You can pay in cash or later, but in this case, it will be 5 large copper coins and 1 medium copper coin."

"I'll pay later, here's my ID. My name is Karina."

<b>

It would be bad to pull a log out of my pocket when they say cash. There are magical bags, but they are expensive, and a bag that can hold a log would be quite large. I don't even have a bag.

I chose to pay later as planned and showed the all-purpose fake ID. …Normally, it would require a note from the village chief or a senior adventurer.

<b>

By the way, one copper coin can buy one black bread.

A medium copper coin is worth five copper coins. A large copper coin is worth ten copper coins.

A silver coin is worth one hundred copper coins, and a gold coin is worth one hundred silver coins. Medium and large coins are the same as copper coins.

(As a merchant, I can do the calculations, so they don't often refer to medium and large copper coins.)

<b>

<b>

So, the registration fee for the Adventurer Guild is originally 5000 yen, but if paid later, it becomes 5500 yen.

<b>

"Yes, there is no problem with the ID. Now, Karina-san, here is a temporary guild certificate that can only be used here. Once the payment is completed, I will issue a proper guild certificate. Your current rank is G."

"Ah, okay."

<b>

I received a wooden plate with a number on it. I see, so this is how the system works.

<b>

By the way, the ranks are G for provisional registration, F for newcomers. D for a full-fledged adventurer, C for mid-level. B for elite and A for super elite. There is also a special rank called S.

Well, it feels pretty standard. Yeah.

<b>

"By the way, can I earn money by hunting monsters? I don't even have money to stay at an inn..."

"Hunting monsters without weapons is not something I can recommend..."

<b>

While I was talking to the receptionist, a red-faced man who had been drinking in the guild's tavern space approached me, swaying with a wooden mug in hand.

<b>

"Hey there, girl, are you in need of money? I can buy you for a night. I'll give you 6 large copper coins!"

"Wait! Blade-san!?"

<b>

…I see, I am currently a girl. No matter what, I have a body.

Looking down, I had breasts, no matter what.

<b>

Well, since I am a guy inside, selling my body to a man is a no-go.

<b>

"…Hmph, if you want to buy me, bring 100 gold coins, drunkard."

<b>

If he touches me, I'll knock him away, I braced myself.

However, the man burst out laughing right there.

<b>

"Haha! I'd love to buy you, but if I had that kind of money, I wouldn't be an adventurer! Ah, sorry, sorry. Here, take this as a nuisance fee. Accept it."

<b>

Saying that, the red-faced adventurer flicked a copper coin with a hole in it— a medium copper coin—toward me.

Confused, I caught it.

<b>

"Nice catch. You'll make a good adventurer."

"Uh… thank you?"

"Haha, just take this and let it go. Hahaha!"

<b>

With that, the man returned to the tavern space. "Hey, you got rejected!" "You were thinking you might have a chance, but look at you trying to act cool!" "Shut up, it's just a service for newcomers!" he joked with two others who seemed to be his companions.

<b>

"…Hmm, I thought I was being hit on, but he was just a kind older brother."

"Um… well, yes. Blade-san is a caring person."

"Blade-san, huh. I'll remember that."

<b>

Thus, I obtained money for the first time in this world.

The first money I received was a tip from a senior adventurer's meddling.
