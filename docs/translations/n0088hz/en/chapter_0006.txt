# If nothing else...

God gave me a universal fake ID card and I was able to safely enter the town.

But we can't hypnotize them every time, so we must quickly obtain proper identification.

Identity laundering is needed.

<blank>

That is how I came to the Merchant's Guild. It is a large square building made of stone.

Once inside, there was a rush in the air. Hmmm, the hustle and bustle of business negotiations was like a quintessential merchant.

I call out to the receptionist at a place called the general counter.

<blank>

Um, I need a guild certificate, how can I get one ......"

Are you new?　Then I'll need your ID and 25 silver coins to join the guild."

Oh, sorry, I'll be back."

<blank>

I don't care if God gave me an ID card, but come to think of it, I don't have any money.

Money......

<blank>

In the story, if you want to earn money from nothing, it is still the Adventurers' Guild.

With spatial magic, there is plenty of time to hunt demons. After all, even the self-proclaimed God of Chaos can be beaten to a pulp unilaterally.

<blank>

Mr. Basic Knowledge also says that the Adventurers Guild can make money if they are skilled.

Being an adventurer and merchant does not seem to be particularly unusual when you are a peddler.

<blank>

And best of all, the Adventurers' Guild allows you to pay the registration fee afterwards, too.

<blank>

"...... once you sign up with the Adventurer's Guild, make a little money, then it's the Merchant's Guild, right?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So now we came to the Adventurers' Guild.

It is a wooden building that looks like a bar. In fact, it also serves as a bar.

<blank>

As I entered, I felt eyes on me. Mainly on my chest. Hey, you guys, they know. It's even more obvious when you're glancing at me.

<blank>

Fortunately, I did not get tangled up and went to the counter normally.

Talk to the receptionist.

<blank>

Excuse me, I'd like to become an adventurer."

Yes, sir. I will need your ID and five large bronze coins for the registration fee. You can pay in kind or later, but in this case it will be for five large coins and one medium coin.

Please pay later, here's my ID. My name is Karina."

<blank>

It would be a bad idea to take a log out of your pocket, even if it is an actual log. I heard that there is a magic bag, but it is expensive, and if it has the capacity to hold a log, it is quite large. I don't even have a bag to begin with.

I chose to pay later as planned and showed my all-purpose fake ID. I heard that ...... originally it would be a letter from the village chief or a senior adventurer or something.

<blank>

By the way, one copper coin is enough to buy one black bread.

The medium copper coin is worth 5 copper coins. The large copper coin is worth 10 copper coins.

The silver coins are worth 100 copper coins, and the gold coins are worth 100 silver coins. Medium and large coins are similar to copper coins.

(They say that if you're a merchant, you can do the math, so they don't say "medium copper coin" or "large copper coin" as often.)

<blank>

<blank>

So, well, the registration fee for the Adventurer's Guild is originally 5000 yen, but if you pay later, it's like 5500 yen.

<blank>

Yes, your ID is fine. Then, Karina, here is a temporary guild card that can only be used here. After payment is made, we will issue a new guild card. Currently, your guild card is G rank.

Uh, yes.

<blank>

Receive a wooden tag with a number on it. I see, so this is the system.

<blank>

By the way, the ranks are G for provisional registration, F for newcomer, D for full-fledged, C for mid-level, B for elite, and A for super-elite. Then there is S as a special rank.

Well, it seems to happen a lot, doesn't it? Yeah.

<blank>

I'm wondering if I can get paid for defeating demons?　I don't even have money to stay at an inn. ......"

"I wouldn't recommend taking down demons without a weapon for a minute. ......

<blank>

As I was talking with the receptionist, a red-faced man who had been drinking in the guild's bar space staggered over to talk to me, wooden mug in hand.

<blank>

'Oh, girl, you're strapped for cash, huh?　I'll buy you a night. I'll give you six large copper coins!"

Hey!　Mr. Blade!

<blank>

......I see, come to think of it, I am a girl now. I had a body, if nothing else.

Looking down, I saw boobs, if not nannies.

<blank>

Well, I'm a man inside, so selling my body to a man is a no-no.

<blank>

'...... Huff, if you want to buy me, bring me 100 gold coins, drunk.'

<blank>

I braced myself to blow him away if he touched me.

But the man sputtered on the spot.

<blank>

I'd love to buy one, but if I had that kind of money, I wouldn't be an adventurer!　I'd love to buy one, but if I had that kind of money, I wouldn't be an adventurer!　Ah, sorry, sorry. Here, it's for the inconvenience. Please take it."

<blank>

With that, the red-faced adventurer flipped a copper coin with a hole in it - a medium copper coin.

Bewildered, I quickly accept it.

<blank>

Nice catch. You'd make a good adventurer."

Um, ...... thanks?"

'Ha ha, give me a break with this. Ha ha!"

<blank>

With that, the man returns to the bar space. He was so cool that he thought he was going to get dumped," "Shut up, it's a service for newcomers! He is fussing with two of his friends.

<blank>

'...... Hmmm, I thought I got tangled up, but it turns out it was just a friendly brother.'

He said, "Uh, ...... well, yes. Mr. Braid is a very caring person."

Mr. Braid, right? I'll remember that."

<blank>

Thus, I got my first money in this world.

The first money he received was a throwaway from a senior adventurer's meddling.
