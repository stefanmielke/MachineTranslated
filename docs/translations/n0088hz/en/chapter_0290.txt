# God?

<blank>

Carrying a maid homunculus, I came to a church in the Kingdom of Alchemy.

It is a small church only for acquiring holy water and does not belong to any siesta. In such a small church with only a chapel, I immediately offered a prayer to God.

<blank>

"Dear God?　I've brought the culprit who newly claimed to be the God of Chaos."

"Oh, here you are!"

<blank>

And we were immediately invited into God's space. Misha was not brought this time.

Then God looked at the maid homunculus and Kaoru and tilted his head.

<blank>

"...... hmm?"

Oh, is something wrong?　Oh. The other Kaoru was just being carried as a palanquin, so I was hoping for a little extenuating circumstances. I'm warming your socks at ......."

"Oh, I see. That's an auspicious mindset."

<blank>

God nodding yes and yes. Can this survive?

<blank>

But you called yourself the God of Chaos, didn't you?"

Hi-yah!"　No, never from myself!　I was just called by this maid without permission!"

"...... hmmm. This girl smells kind of nice. ...... I think I'll forgive her."

'Oh, bruh!　I survived ...... I survived!"

Good for you, Kaoru.

Yeah, thanks to Karina!　Thank you!"

<blank>

Kaoru is pleased. You did it. From now on, let's enjoy this world together as my friends.

By the way, you can make a beautiful girl with a homunculus, right?　I'm looking forward to it, fwiw.

<blank>

But still, God seems to be in some kind of a state of limbo.

<blank>

Ah. So, this maid homunculus over here is the culprit and mastermind. She was working for the self-proclaimed god of chaos, and she was ordered to do something?　So I heard."

Hmm. I see."

<blank>

Huh?　And here I finally felt uncomfortable.

The god who had been so angry with me is now very quiet. The last time, or rather the first time I dealt with the god of chaos, he even destroyed a country.

<blank>

By the way, this homunculus seems to be wearing a large number of sacred artifacts.　He said he had 108 sacred artifacts.

Hmm?　Hmmm, no, this guy doesn't seem to have any other divine artifacts of any kind."

<blank>

If that's what God, who stared at the maid homunculus, said, it must have been self-proclaimed after all. He's a disturbing guy at all. ......

<blank>

Hmm?

What's wrong, Karina?　I'll give you 10,000 SP as a reward for catching the culprit. Let's play hard for a while, shall we?"

Yes, if you have 10,000 SP, it's like eating all the sweets you can eat, like 50 SP."

Oh. The life of the girl there is in exchange for a fraction of Kalina's SP. You have 10,000 SP left."

God!　I don't think it's a good idea to come out afterwards like that!"

I rule."

<blank>

Yes, this is the kind of God I'm talking about. Huh, I guess I'll have to switch camps on this one.

...... hmm?　camp?　I tilted my head. But I quickly thought of a good thing and forgot about it.

<blank>

The 10,000 SP is a reward for catching the culprit, and this maid, or more precisely the maid's property itself, still belongs to me, doesn't it?"

Hmm?　Hmm. Well, yes?"

Then we can get another SP for the socks this guy is wearing!"

Mhm. Hmmm, well, okay. I approve."

I'm like, "Hey, what the heck? These socks have been worn out for a week and now they are smelly and embarrassing! You pervert!"

<blank>

A maid homunculus desperately hates and jitters. This is a good thing. The more she hates it, the more shame she feels, and the more SP she has!

<blank>

I've got a good idea!　I have a good idea!　How about having God take off your clothes directly with his hands?　If you want, you can do it with your mouth, like this, with a gulp.

You say, "Oh, does that mean ...... dancing and eating?　Wow, dancing and eating socks!　What a very, very, very nice and good idea, Karina!　I'm giving you a round of flowers!"

<blank>

I got your compliments, yay!

I mean, I've never heard of socks dancing and eating. God, you're an unbelievable pervert.

<blank>

Ora, you mastermind, you've gotten yourself into a lot of trouble by doing unnecessary things. Go dance and get eaten by the gods while apologizing."

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

<blank>

While tied up, he makes her offer her foot out of her skirt and remove her shoe. The socks that appeared from the enamel pumps were white socks. They were stained black enough to show the shape of the soles, and the scent of the socks made me realize that they had been worn for a week, which was no lie.

<blank>

Oh," he said, "this is already a guaranteed high point at this point!　That's already a guaranteed high point at this point!"

Ora, maid!　God demands it, serve my socks like a maid!"

Kuku, please enjoy your meal."

<blank>

The auspicious maid homunculus, who says so, does not change her color at all and offers her legs honestly, though she resists.

<blank>

Well, Bon appétit!

<blank>

God covered the toe of that smelly sock with a big smile on his face.
