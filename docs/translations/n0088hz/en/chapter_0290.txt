# God—?

<b>

Carrying the maid homunculus, I arrived at the church in the Alchemy Kingdom.

It was a small church solely for obtaining holy water, and Siesta was not affiliated with it. In such a tiny chapel-like church, I immediately offered a prayer to God.

<b>

“God—? I’ve brought the culprit who was claiming to be the Chaos God!”

“Oh, you’ve come!”

<b>

And just like that, we were invited into the divine space. It seemed Misha wasn’t brought along this time.

Upon seeing the maid homunculus and Kaoru, God tilted their head.

<b>

“...Hmm?”

“Is something the matter? Ah, this Kaoru over here was just being carried as a palanquin, so I was hoping for a bit of leniency. ...Right now, I’m warming up their socks.”

“Oh, is that so? That’s a commendable mindset.”

<b>

Nodding, God seemed pleased. Could we survive this?

<b>

“But they were claiming to be the Chaos God, right?”

“Y-yes!? No, I never claimed that myself! I was just called that by this maid without my consent!”

“...Hmm. This child has a nice scent, so maybe I’ll let it slide.”

“Thank you! I’ve survived... I’ve survived!!”

“Good for you, Kaoru.”

“Ah, it’s thanks to Karina! Thank you!”

<b>

Kaoru rejoiced. Yay, from now on, let’s enjoy this world together as my companion.

By the way, you can create beautiful girls with homunculi, right? I’m looking forward to it, hehe.

<b>

That said, God seemed somewhat indecisive.

<b>

“Ah. So, this maid homunculus is the culprit and the mastermind. They were serving the self-proclaimed Chaos God and were ordered to do so, or something like that?”

“Hmm. Is that so?”

<b>

Huh? It was at this point that I finally felt something was off.

God, who had been so furious, seemed oddly calm. The last time, or rather, when I first dealt with the Chaos God, they had destroyed nations.

<b>

“By the way, this homunculus seems to be wearing a large number of divine artifacts, but will I receive a bonus for that? They claimed to have 108 divine artifacts or something.”

“Hmm? Hmm, no, it seems they don’t have any divine artifacts at all.”

<b>

If God said that while staring intently at the maid homunculus, it must have been a self-proclamation after all. Really, what a troublesome person...

<b>

“Hmm?”

“Is something the matter, Karina-chan? Ah, it’s a reward for capturing the culprit. I’ll grant you 10,000 SP. Let’s indulge for a while, shall we?”

“That’s right, with 10,000 SP, I can eat all the sweets that cost 50 SP or so!”

“Ah. The life of that child is exchanged for the leftover SP from Karina-chan. So, you have 10,000 SP remaining.”

“God!? I don’t think it’s right to change the rules like that!!”

“I am the rule.”

<b>

That’s right, this is the kind of God they were. Sigh, it can’t be helped if I have to switch sides.

...Hmm? Switch sides? I tilted my head. But I quickly thought of something good and forgot.

<b>

“Um, God. The 10,000 SP is a reward for capturing the culprit, and I still have ownership of this maid, or rather, the maid’s property, right?”

“Hmm? Hmm. Well, yes?”

“Then, I can receive SP for the socks they’re wearing, right?!”

“Hmm. Well, okay. I’ll allow it.”

“W-what!? S-stop! These socks have been worn for a week and are currently extremely smelly and embarrassing! You pervert!”

<b>

The maid homunculus desperately wriggled and protested. Hehe, this is convenient. The more they resist, the more their sense of shame rises, and the SP increases!

<b>

“Ah! I’ve thought of a great idea! How about having God directly take them off? If you want, you could even use your mouth, like, tugging them off.”

“Eh, does that mean... eating them while dancing? Wow, dancing while eating socks! What a wonderfully splendid idea, Karina-chan! I’ll give you a flower mark!”

<b>

I’ve been praised, yay!

Speaking of which, I’ve never heard of eating socks while dancing. As expected of God, an irredeemable pervert.

<b>

“Hey, you mastermind, it’s your fault for doing unnecessary things that made everything troublesome. Apologize while being eaten by God.”

“N-no, s-stop, l-let go!”

<b>

While still bound, I made them extend their leg out from the skirt and took off their shoes. The socks that appeared from the patent leather pumps were white. They were so dirty that the shape of the soles was visible, and the smell that spread made it clear that wearing them for a week was no lie.

<b>

“Oh! This already guarantees high points at this stage!”

“Hey maid! God desires it, serve the socks like a maid!”

“Ugh, please enjoy them.”

<b>

Saying that, the maid homunculus, without changing their expression at all, obediently extended their foot while resisting.

<b>

“Well then, I’ll dig in—!!”

<b>

With a beaming smile, God bit into the stinky sock’s toe.
