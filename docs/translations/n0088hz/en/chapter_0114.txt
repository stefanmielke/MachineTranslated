# NTR destroys the brain...!

<b>

The forest inside the dungeon wasn't very wide in the upper area, but it seemed quite spacious in the horizontal direction.

<b>

This is probably a space that has been expanded with space magic. I do think there is a theory that dungeons = users of space magic.

People learn from nature as their teacher. Just like discovering gravity by watching an apple fall, or learning Mantis Fist from a mantis as a master, it might be a good idea for me to learn further space magic with the dungeon as my teacher.

<b>

By the way, I just realized that being in this place—inside someone else's space magic—makes me... well, quite dizzy. I wonder if it's because my body understands the original space, but there's a difference from the space my mind recognizes... ugh.

<b>

"It's just like seasickness... no, maybe it's VR sickness..."

<b>

I'm barely holding back from vomiting, but at this rate, it's only a matter of time before my stomach reverses. Curse you, dungeon, what a trap.

I probably entered Aisia's room by mistake because of this...

<b>

<b>

Since there's no helping it, I decided to return to the storage space for a while.

<b>

"Ah, this is tough. I'm back... Wait, neither Dia-kun nor Aisia is here."

<b>

It's still a bright afternoon. I wonder if they went sightseeing or shopping in Calcutta... I'm a bit worried. I should check on them. Here we go, here we go!

<b>

‘—Aisia-san, how about this?’

‘Oh, it's cute! As expected, Dia-sama has good taste—’

<b>

I confirmed the safety of the two and quietly closed the window.

...It seems they are buying accessories. Are they on a date?

When did they become that close...!? Aisia, you said you admired me! Dia-kun, you said you were over your first love!?

<b>

Ugh, the feeling of being left out! ...Wait, maybe this could be a surprise present for me!?

I peeked in again.

<b>

‘—Yeah, it suits Dia-sama!’

‘Is that so? Hmm, then, um, shall I buy it—’

<b>

I quickly closed it.

Daaaah! It was Dia-kun's personal shopping! He was buying a cute ribbon!

No way! This is a date! They're dating while leaving me out!

<b>

Sure, I'm a guy on the inside, and I still can't respond to Dia-kun's feelings! But Aisia is my slave, so I have to maintain a dignified attitude as her master!

If those two get together, even though this is my own storage space, I’ll be left out!! I’ll be purified by their lovey-dovey vibes! Help me, Satiiiiiii!!

<b>

...Peek.

<b>

‘—Well done.’

‘Hehe.’

<b>

Ah! Ah! Dia-kun is petting Aisia's head!

Oh no. I feel like throwing up. NTR destroys the brain...!

<b>

"Uroooooo..."

<b>

I teleported to the bathroom and reversed the contents of my stomach.

...Ah, I'm sorry, Scavenger Slime-kun. I made you process what came out from above... Oh, this is okay. Hmm, it really is a deep karma for a living being.

<b>

<b>

Ugh. But what they were buying was a ribbon. This means I'm progressing smoothly on the path of being a cute boy, which is correct as a beautiful girl for appreciation. Should I be happy about this...?

Ah. That's right, growing as a cute boy means that they are just two girls going out shopping together. It's a date, but not a typical boy-girl date! It's a yuri friendship date!

<b>

I peeked at the two again. Space magic, here we go, here we go!

<b>

‘—Dia-sama, I'll carry the bags!’

‘It's okay, I can carry this much. I can't let Aisia-san carry it—’

<b>

Hehbaaaaaah!

Dia-kun was doing a cool move by not letting a girl carry the bags.

Ugh, so cute.

Calm down. Calm down, me. Deep breath... in, out, in, out.

<b>

Ugh, is this the flow where those two get together?

If that's the case, I'll be super lonely, but I have to bless them... ugh...
