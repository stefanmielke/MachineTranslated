# NTR destroys the brain. ......

The forest in the dungeon was not very wide on the upward side, but it seemed to be quite wide in the flat direction.

<blank>

Perhaps this is a space that has been expanded by spatial magic. I still think there is a theory that dungeons = spatial magic users.

One learns from nature as one's master. Like discovering the force of attraction by watching an apple fall or mastering the mantis with a praying mantis as a teacher, it may be possible for me to learn more spatial magic with the dungeon as my teacher.

<blank>

I mean, I just noticed that when I'm in this place - in a spatial magic that is not my own ...... that, I get pretty drunk. I wonder if there is a difference between the space that my body is aware of and the space that my head is aware of, even though my body is aware of the space as it should be,...... woebegone.

"I feel like I'm seasick...... or maybe VR sickness......"

<blank>

I barely haven't thrown up, but at this rate, it will only be a matter of time before my stomach reverses itself. Oh, dungeon, what a trap.

Maybe this is why I went into Isiah's room by mistake: ......

<blank>

<blank>

Since we had no choice, we decided to return to the storage space at once.

<blank>

Oh, that's too tight. I'm sorry, ......, but neither Deere nor Isiah are here."

<blank>

It is late afternoon and the sun is still high in the sky. I wonder if they are going sightseeing or shopping in Carcassa. I'm a little worried about ....... I'll keep an eye on them. Eiyei, mmmm!

<blank>

'--"How about this, Ms. Isiah?"

'Oh, it's lovely!　As I thought, Dear-sama has good taste--'

<blank>

I gently closed the window as I made sure they were safe.

Looks like he is buying ...... accessories. Is she on a date?

When did you become such a good friend ......?　Aisia, you said you adore me, right?　Dia, you said you don't need me anymore as your first love!

<blank>

Ugh, I feel so alienated! ...... No, wait, maybe it could be a surprise present for me!

I glance at it again.

<blank>

'--Yes, it suits you, Mr. Dear!

'Really?　Well, then, I guess I'll buy one...'

<blank>

Close quickly.

Daaaaah!　It was Dear's personal shopping!　He bought a cute ribbon!

Oh no!　This is a date!　You made me an outcast, and now you're on a date with me!

<blank>

Well, I'm a man on the inside, so I can't answer to your feelings yet!　Aisia is my slave too, so I have to treat her with a firm attitude as a master!

If they get together, I'll be holed up in my own storage space!　I'll be purified by the vibrations of lovemaking!　Help me, Satyoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

...... flicker.

<blank>

"Well done.

Ehehehe."

<blank>

Aah!　Ahh!　Dia is stroking Isiah's head!

Oh no, I'm going to throw up. I'm going to throw up. ntr destroys the brain. ......

<blank>

I transitioned to the bathroom and reversed the contents of my stomach.

...... Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Scavenger Slime. I let you deal with what I took out of the top. ...... Oh, this is okay. Hmmm, I knew it was a deep karmic life form.

<blank>

<blank>

Ugh. But it was ribbons I was buying. In other words, she seems to be on her way to becoming a man's daughter, and as an ornamental pretty boy girl, it's the right thing to do, you know. Should I be happy about this ......?

Ha. Yes, growing up as a man's daughter just means two girls going out and shopping together. It's a date, or rather, a date, but not a man-woman date!　It's a yuri friendship date!

<blank>

I glance at them again. Spatial magic, ei, ei, mmm!

<blank>

Dear, I will carry your baggage.

I can carry this much. I can't let you carry it.

<blank>

Hebuaaaaah!

Dia-kun was doing a handsome move that didn't let the girls carry the baggage.

Ugh, so cool and cute.

Oh, calm down. Calm down, me. Deep breath ...... sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

<blank>

Ugh, I wonder if that's it. I wonder if this is a trend of them getting together.

If so, I'm super sad, but I have to congratulate you. ......, kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu... ......
