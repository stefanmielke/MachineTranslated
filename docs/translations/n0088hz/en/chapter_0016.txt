# The Woodsman Again.

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. It feels like this is the first time I’ve had breakfast in this world, doesn’t it?

So, the third day of my otherworldly life starts now. (Excluding the tutorial)

...It’s still only the third day, huh. (Excluding the tutorial)

<b>

Although I can’t say breakfast was delicious enough to declare it so, I was really happy with Sister’s kindness, so it was practically a feast.

<b>

"By the way, what’s Sister’s name?"

"Hm? It’s Siesta. It’s a pretty common name."

<b>

I see, Siesta, Sister. They sound quite similar and are easy to remember.

To respond to Siesta-san’s kindness, I’ll do my best as a woodsman today too!

<b>

<b>

<b>

With that determination, I headed to the Adventurers' Guild today as well.

<b>

"Hey, Karina. I heard you tried to do the woodsman work all by yourself?"

"Oh, Blade-senpai. Yeah, what about it?"

"Well, we were just thinking of doing some woodsman work too. Let us help you out. It must be tough alone, right?"

<b>

Blade-senpai grinned widely, showing his teeth. Shieldon and Sekko were also there.

...If I misstep, this could sound like they’re trying to leech off me, but I guess Blade-senpai doesn’t know that I cleared it easily. He probably doesn’t know.

<b>

Today, he’s not drunk, so he must just be in a caring mode.

<b>

<b>

But sorry, this request is for one person only. (For me, at least)

<b>

<b>

"Ah, no, senpai. I’m going to do it alone—"

<b>

As I was about to refuse, I suddenly realized that if these three helped me, I could carry a lot more logs at once.

So, I decided to change my plans and invite them.

<b>

"If I take seven, and you guys take three, that works for me!"

"Hey, hey, at least let it be the other way around. As your senpai, I’ll teach you various tips. If you do it right, being a woodsman can be a lucrative job."

"That’s true, I earned two silver coins after that yesterday."

"........Huh? Wait a minute. What? You succeeded? Solo? And two coins... that means two logs!?"

"Yeah. I carried the logs hugging them on both sides and brought them back. Right, receptionist-san?"

<b>

When I turned to her, the receptionist nodded vigorously from behind the counter.

The three were astonished.

<b>

"Why didn’t you tell us? That’s so embarrassing for us!!"

"The success or failure of requests is personal information, so the guild can’t spread that around, you know?"

"Ah, I see, it is personal information... I guess that can’t be helped, Blade."

"You were really smug about it, huh? That’s hilarious."

"Shieldon... Sekko... no, but still..."

<b>

It seems that the seniors only received the information that "a newbie accepted a woodsman request" after I delivered the slime core. Since I went directly to the lumberyard instead of the Adventurers' Guild, there were no witnesses.

<b>

"But still, that changes things. It means we don’t need to help you... So, how did you do it? Can I ask?"

"Simply put, I used magic to do it quickly."

"Ah, that thing. Magic is amazing, huh?"

<b>

So they’re convinced just like that. Isn’t Blade-senpai too pure?

<b>

"So, since I can easily handle it alone, if you guys are going to help, I thought it’d be around 70:30."

"No, do we really need to?"

"I can say, 'Everyone! Did you carry the logs!?' so I’ll say we do."

"What’s that? Well, fine, I had cleared my schedule to help you today anyway."

<b>

Seriously? Senpai is such a nice person.

<b>

"Don’t lie. You’re just being pressured for payment by the innkeeper at Shunrai-tei."

"She gets scary when she’s angry. Her tail goes all poofy."

"Don’t say that! It’s embarrassing!"

<b>

Ah, it’s Harumikazuchi-san. Well, that can’t be helped.

<b>

<b>

In the end, the seniors decided to help me with my woodsman work.

The share was as I proposed, 70:30.

<b>

We promptly headed towards the forest.

<b>

"Hey, aren’t we using a cart?"

"I don’t have a cart, you know?"

"Are you stupid? Just borrow one—oh, right. Since we’re F rank, we can’t borrow one without an introduction. We can borrow one, though."

<b>

Oh, that’s helpful. If we each carry one log in both arms, that’s two, so four people can carry eight logs.

<b>

"If we have a cart, we can carry six logs!"

"Don’t you think we don’t need it?"

"Eh, is that so?"

"Wait a minute. If each of us can carry six logs, then it would be better to have one..."

"Huh!? Wait a minute, how many are you planning to cut!?"

<b>

Well, as many as I can cut?

<b>

"It costs one large copper coin to borrow one cart for a day... It’s not impossible to borrow, but can we make a profit?"

"We can easily do it!"

"Seriously? Magic is amazing."

"No, no, Blade. You can’t just swallow that whole and believe it."

"Speaking of which, isn’t Blade’s trust in Karina-chan too high? Did something happen?"

"Ah! I had a little chat with Karina at Shunrai-tei! I can’t forget that night’s stage..."

<b>

Hey, you were watching? I only know what Harumikazuchi-san told me, and it’s super embarrassing!

<b>

"This girl is trustworthy! I guarantee it!"

"......Hey, really, what did you do? Did you become Blade’s lover or something?"

"Sekko-san. That’s definitely not the case, but it’s a secret."

<b>

It’s an embarrassing past that I want to remember but also don’t want to remember...!

<b>

<b>

With Blade-senpai’s introduction, we borrowed four carts, and we arrived at the forest.

<b>

"Okay, I’ll cut the trees."

"Alright! I’ll keep watch around us!"

"I’m going to fall!"

"That’s too fast!?"

<b>

Because it’s instant with spatial magic.

And just before the tree hits the ground, I fixed the space. I stopped it completely and gently lowered it.

<b>

"I couldn’t even see the moment you activated it...!"

"It’s just a slight application of wind magic, Sekko-san."

"Is wind magic like this...?"

"See? Karina is amazing, right?"

"Why is Blade so proud? Well, at least it seems like the cart won’t go to waste."

<b>

Well, since each person can carry six logs, I’ll chop down 23 more quickly.

<b>

"Then at least let me handle the branch cutting—"

"Oh. I forgot. Here I go!"

"That was instant!? Karina-chan, that’s incredible! So, for loading—"

"Oh. I’ll lighten it with magic."

"No way..."

<b>

Not only cutting, but also branch cutting is done in an instant with spatial magic!

<b>

By hollowing out the insides and placing them in the storage space, it becomes significantly lighter!

(I’ll put it back later so it doesn’t get found out!)

<b>

<b>

Hahaha, this is the essence of spatial magic!

<b>

<b>

"Wow, it’s true that Karina-chan can handle it alone... Do we even need to be here?"

"Procedurally, yes, we do."

"What’s that supposed to mean?"

"Help with carrying! Did you carry the logs!?"

"Hey, another person!? That’s too fast!?"

<b>

Moreover, since we could make two trips, we successfully delivered 48 logs in one day.
