# Lumberjacks again.

<blank>

<blank>

I, Karina-chan. I feel like I'm having my first breakfast in this world?

So here we are at the start of the 3rd day of living in another world. (Excluding tutorials)

...... It's only day 3. (except for the tutorials)

<blank>

Although the breakfast was not as good as I can say, it was practically a treat because I was very happy with the kindness of the sisters.

<blank>

Oh, by the way, what's your name, Sister?"

Hmm?"　I'm Siesta, sir. It's a common name."

<blank>

I see, siesta, sister. Very similar, easy to remember.

To repay Mr. Siesta's kindness, let's do our best to be lumberjacks today!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

With such enthusiasm, I came to the Adventurers' Guild today.

<blank>

"Hey, Karina. I heard you tried to be a lumberjack all by yourself.

Oh, Braid senior. Yes, so what?"

No, we were just thinking of doing some lumberjack work. "No, we were just thinking about becoming lumberjacks too. It's too hard to do it alone, right?"

<blank>

Braid-senpai smiles with a toothy grin. Shildon and Sekko are also there.

...... one wrong step and it's a parasitic statement to hang on to me, but I wonder if Braid senior doesn't know that I cleared it up with ease. I guess he doesn't know.

<blank>

And since I'm not drunk today, I must simply be in a caring mode.

<blank>

<blank>

Sorry though, this request is for one person. (Only for me)

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, no, senpai. I am alone--"

<blank>

As I was about to refuse, it occurred to me that if these three people helped me, I could carry that many logs at a time.

So I decided to change my plans and solicit them.

<blank>

If I'm 7 and the seniors are 3, that's fine!"

He said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. As a senior, I'm going to teach you a lot of tricks. If you do it right, being a lumberjack can be a very lucrative job.

Yes, I earned two silver coins yesterday after that."

"............ hmm?　Wait a minute. Huh?　Did you succeed?　Solo?　And two ......2 books!"

I was like, "Yeah, I've got a log. I brought it back with logs on either side of me. Hey, receptionist."

<blank>

When I spoke to her, the receptionist nodded cockily behind the counter.

The three are surprised.

<blank>

You should have said, "Tell me!　That would be a huge embarrassment to us!"

"The success or failure of a request is private information, and as a guild we can't blow the whistle on it, can we?"

"Uh, mmm, it's private information, ....... I don't blame you for this one, Blade."

I'm amazed at the smug look on your face.

"Shildon ...... seccoh ...... no, but hey ......"

<blank>

Apparently, the seniors, after I delivered the slime nucleus, only got the information that 'there is a newcomer who accepted the woodcutter's request. At the time of delivery, I took it directly to the lumber yard, not to the Adventurers' Guild, so there were no witnesses.

<blank>

I'm sure that would be a different story then. It means you don't need our help, and ...... Hey, seriously, how did you do that?　Can I ask?"

Simply put, a little bit of magic."

"Oh, that. Magic is awesome!"

<blank>

That makes sense to me. Blade senior is too pure, isn't he?

<blank>

So, I can easily handle it on my own, but if the seniors help me, it's more like 7:3.

"No. Do you want us?"

"Now you can say, 'Hey guys!　You got the log? I'm going to need it."

What's that? Well, that's okay, I've cleared my schedule to help you today."

<blank>

Seriously. Your senpai is so nice.

<blank>

"You're lying. The lady at Shunrai-tei is just demanding payment.

When she gets angry, she's scary. Her tail goes wagging."

Don't say it. It's not tight, is it?

<blank>

Ah, Mr. Harumikazuchi. Well then, it can't be helped.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

The seniors ended up helping me with my woodcutting.

The split is 7:3 as I suggested.

<blank>

He tries to head for the forest as soon as possible.

<blank>

Hey, don't you use a cart?"

I don't have a cart, remember?"

"You're an idiot, you can just rent it..." I said, "Well, it's an F. You can't rent it without a referral. We can rent it.

<blank>

Oh, thank goodness for that. Two bottles, one held in each arm, that's eight bottles for four people, right?

<blank>

If we had a cart, we could carry six of them!"

Don't you want to do it?"

Yeah, right?"

No, wait. If each of us can carry six bottles, we'd better have some. ......"

"Nn!　Wait a minute, how many trees are you going to cut down!"

<blank>

Well, well, just to be logged?

<blank>

It costs one large copper coin a day to rent one cart. It's not impossible to rent a cart from ......, but will you get your money back?"

I can afford it!"

I thought to myself, "Really? Magic is amazing."

No, no, no, Blade. You're right, we can't just swallow that whole and believe it."

Or rather, isn't Braid's trust in little Carina too thick?"　What's wrong?"

Oh, yeah, I met Karina at the Shunlai Pavilion for a bit!　I met Karina at the Shunlai Pavilion for a bit!　I'll never forget that night on stage. ......"

<blank>

Hey, you've been watching. I myself only know what I heard from Mr. Harumikazuchi about the totally embarrassing act ......!

<blank>

This is a woman you can trust!　I guarantee it!"

I'm sure you're thinking, "...... Hey, really, what did you do?　Did you become Blade's mistress?"

Mr. Sekou. That will never happen, but it's a secret."

<blank>

It's an embarrassing past that I'd like to remember, too, but I don't. ......

<blank>

<blank>

With the introduction of Braid senior, we rented four carts and we came to the forest.

<blank>

Okay, I'll cut it off.

I'll take care of the perimeter!　I'll take care of the perimeter!"

I'm coming for you!

How fast?

<blank>

Because it's just a moment with spatial magic.

Then, just before it falls to the ground, the space is fixed. Stop it completely with a snug fit, and then lower it gently.

<blank>

"didn't even see the moment of activation: ......!"

A little application of wind magic, Mr. Sekko."

"Is this what wind magic is like ......?"

You know what?　Karina is awesome, right?"

What's Braid bragging about...... No, I'm just glad the cargo bed doesn't look like it's going to waste."

<blank>

Well, it's 6 trees per person, and we'll cut down 23 more quickly!

<blank>

Then at least leave the branching to me..."

Oh. I forgot. Yes!

For a moment?　That's outrageous, Karina-chan!　Well, I'll be the one to load it..."

I'll lighten it with magic. I'll use magic to lighten the load."

Lie-o-n ......"

<blank>

Not only logging, but branching is also an instantaneous process with spatial magic!

<blank>

The contents are hollowed out and left in the storage space to save a burly amount of weight!

(I'll put it back in so you won't find out later!)

<blank>

<blank>

Hahahahaha, this is the essence of spatial magic!

<blank>

<blank>

'Holy crap, surely one Karina-chan is enough ...... do you need us?'

It's more than procedural.

What the hell is that?

"Carry the load!　You got the logs?

Hey, one more for the road!　What the hell?"

<blank>

And since we were able to make two round trips, we managed to deliver 48 logs in one day.
