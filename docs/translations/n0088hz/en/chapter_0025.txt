# The Failure of Karina, a Perfectly Beautiful Girl

(This year's fortune was good. Yoshi!)

Ah, it took me longer than I thought to get to the vault.

I only had about 5 silver coins total in my wallet and it took a lot of work.

<blank>

Well, I've marked those guys, and if any of them try to run away without turning themselves in, I'll do a "one more time" as I declared and send them to jail again.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh yeah, and when I was scaring those guys, I made it as bright as daylight, but that was actually sunlight.

<blank>

The method is simple.

Leave the spatial magic open to the sun during the daytime.

In this way, "sunlight" can be stored in spatial magic.

<blank>

Well, the spatial magic storage space can manipulate light, sound, and temperature at will, so I didn't need to use that. I only realized this a few days ago.

I thought it would be good for storage space room lighting: ......

<blank>

<blank>

Well, now I'm sleepy because I've been up all night, so let's go to the vault after a good night's sleep.

...... hmm? I think I'm forgetting something.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, I haven't reported to my seniors.

<blank>

I should at least report that I'm okay because I got help and I punished all the people who got involved. I've been up all night ...... and I'm sleepy, so I'll try to get a good night's sleep!

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

So I've been exterminating wallets."

I mean, you're looking at nothing but a wallet. ...... No, that's enough. So?"

I caught all the guys in my territory, and my wallet had about five silver coins in it. Too many fish!

<blank>

Lumberjacks make far more money than this!

<blank>

"If you're a bad guy, why don't you save up some more money?"

They're going to get the money locally, and when they get it, they're going to go have a good time. They don't have a lot of money.

'If you ask me. Senior sage, huh?"

<blank>

Well, I heard that everywhere was waiting for a rumor of a sucker holding 40 silver coins yesterday, right?

<blank>

I'll see you later. So after this, I was thinking of going to the safe - no, not the safe. I'm thinking of going to the slavers after this. How about you join us, senpai?

<blank>

When I said this in my best manner, Blade-senpai furrowed his brow as if he were looking at a disappointed child.

<blank>

What's with that face? I'm going to magically do things to you, too, senpai?"

"Oh, I don't know, ...... I kind of knew it was you. ......

If you have something to say, please say it clearly!"

...... that slaver, the military police are probably finished destroying him by now."

<blank>

What, what's ...... and ......?

<blank>

Stop!　My money!　I can't allow you to hit me sideways!

That's the first thing that comes out of your mouth. ...... You turned those goons in."

I made you do it, didn't I? What's the matter, senpai, this time you are early with the information.

There's a filling station near my house. "There's a place near my house, and they were talking loudly, 'I'm a ________! I was talking so loudly, I could hear it.

<blank>

I see, don't you?

<blank>

The military police immediately went to the slaver based on that testimony. "Based on that testimony, the military police immediately went to the slavers, and they did so quickly so that their prey would not escape.

"...... ah."

<blank>

In other words, it seems that while I was sleeping, they took all the tasty bits away from me.

Hey, military police!　You work fast, damn it!

It's my fault I fell asleep!

<blank>

Gusun, my safe oh ......"

Some of them probably needed to be rescued as soon as possible, so why not?"

Damn right, Paisen is too good for them."

<blank>

Furthermore, it seems that the slaver's money was to be used to compensate the victims, so it is not possible to intercept it now.

......It's going to be harder to take money from bad people in the future when I hear stories like that!　Mooo!

<blank>

<blank>

I mean, seriously, how did they do that? They are supposed to be strong in their own way, but to scare them that much is unusual.

That's right, I'm just going to use my magic to do it.

I see. I wasn't worried about getting hit at all, but ...... magic is awesome."

<blank>

Maybe I should study too?　I'll stop with the stones," spilled Blade-senpai.

My level would have to be loved by God to be able to do that!

<blank>

I'm going to go give a report to God. Oh, I'll just take the bait on this one, please."

Well, there's no point in showing off your power for nothing. ...... Well, if you want money, you can always invite me to join the lumberjacks."

"inn

"...... is that an acknowledgment?"

<blank>

And so, after talking with Braid-senpai like this, I decided to go and report to God since it seemed that I no longer had a kakuchi plan.
