# The Perfect Beautiful Girl Karina's Mistake

(This year's omikuji was good luck. Yoshi!)

<b>

Ah, it took more time than I expected, and I couldn't make it to the vault.

I only had about five silver coins in my wallet, and it took a lot of effort.

<b>

Well, I've marked those guys, so if anyone tries to escape without turning themselves in, I'll declare a one more set and shove them back to the station again.

<b>

<b>

Oh right, when I was threatening those guys, I was brightening the place like it was daytime, but that was actually illuminated by sunlight.

<b>

The method is simple.

Keep a spatial magic open towards the sun during the day.

By doing this, you can store "sunlight" in the spatial magic.

<b>

Well, the storage space of spatial magic can freely manipulate light, sound, and temperature, so it wasn't necessary to do it that way. I just realized that a moment ago.

I thought it would be good lighting for the storage space room...

<b>

<b>

Now, I'm sleepy since I stayed up all night, so I'll take a nap before heading to the vault.

...Huh? It feels like I'm forgetting something.

<b>

<b>

"Ah, I haven't reported to the seniors yet."

<b>

Since they helped me out, I should at least report that I dealt with all the troublemakers. ...But I'm sleepy from staying up all night, so I'll take a nap first!

<b>

"So, I went and dealt with the wallet."

"Wait, do you only see it as a wallet...? Well, whatever. So what happened?"

"I caught all the territory guys, and the contents of the wallet were about five silver coins in total. Too shabby!"

<b>

With this, the lumberjack would definitely earn way more!

<b>

"Is it like, if you're a bad guy, you should be hoarding more money?"

"They probably get their play money locally, and once they get it, they rush off to have fun. They can't possibly have a lot of money."

"Now that you mention it. Are you a wise senior or what?"

<b>

Well, I heard there were rumors about a target with forty silver coins yesterday, and it seems like everyone was waiting for it.

<b>

"Yeah, so after this, I was thinking of storming the vault—no, the slave trader. How about it, senior? Want to join me?"

<b>

When I said this proudly, Blade-senpai frowned as if looking at a disappointing child.

<b>

"What’s with that face? You’re going to use magic for this, right?"

"Ah, how should I put it... I kind of figured it was your doing, but..."

"If you have something to say, just say it clearly!"

"…That slave trader is probably being taken down by the military police right now."

<b>

Wha, what...?

<b>

"Wait!? What about my money!? A side hit like that is unacceptable!"

"The fact that you brought that up first says a lot... You made those punks turn themselves in, didn’t you?"

"I did. What’s up, senior? You’re quick on the uptake this time."

"There’s a station near our place. And I heard them loudly saying, 'I did ○○!' so I caught wind of it."

<b>

I see?

<b>

"So, based on that testimony, the military police quickly headed to the slave trader. They made sure the prey wouldn’t escape."

"…Ah."

<b>

In other words, it seems I lost out on the good stuff while I was sleeping.

Damn military police! They work fast, don’t they!?

It’s my fault for falling asleep!

<b>

"Sniff, my vault..."

"Well, there were probably people who needed rescuing quickly, so it’s a good thing, right?"

"Damn it, senior, you’re too nice."

<b>

Moreover, it seems the money the slave trader had will be used for compensation to the victims, so it looks like I can’t just take it now.

...Hearing that makes it harder to steal money from bad guys in the future! Ugh!

<b>

<b>

"By the way, how did you do it? They should be relatively strong, but to scare them that much is unusual."

"Well, it’s just a bit of magic."

"I see. I wasn’t worried about being attacked at all... Magic is amazing."

<b>

I wonder if I should try studying it too? Blade-senpai murmured, so I decided to stop him.

At my level, I’d need to be loved by the gods to manage that!

<b>

"Well, I’ll go report to the gods. Oh, for this matter, please just consider me as bait."

"Yeah, there’s no point in showing off my strength unnecessarily... Well, if you want money, just invite me to be a lumberjack anytime."

"Got it."

"…Is that an understanding?"

<b>

So, after talking with Blade-senpai like that, it seems the plan to storm was off, so I decided to go report to the gods.
