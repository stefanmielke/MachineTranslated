# For God's sake, people!

Later, the hired adventurers returned to eat their senior's food.

Oops. I see Shildon-senpai and Sekko-senpai are in the mix.

<blank>

"Hey, I've got some bad news. Listen while you eat."

What's up, Blade?"

"Hmm?　I mean, who is that guy?"

<blank>

I am disguised as a healer beforehand. There is no need to tell anyone other than my seniors that I am an apostle of God.

<blank>

"Something ...... tells me that God is furious ...... with the new king of this country."

What about?"

...... seriously?"

<blank>

And Blade-senpai's words attract my gaze, as I am not acquainted with most of the members gathered here. The healer's appearance is full of suspicion. In the first place, there is a darkness in which I cannot see his face even if I look into his robe.

<blank>

Blade. Is that guy involved?"

Oh. This is the ...... apostle. He has come to deliver God's word."

I can't believe it!　I can't believe it!　Show me the proof!

<blank>

Hey, Misha, don't sneak over there. I didn't ask for a cherry!

<blank>

That's right. I don't believe it for a second, even if they say there's a God or something.

"How much more believable is it that he's lying?"

"......, but I don't think Braid would believe any lies or bullshit without any evidence to back it up. What is it, then?"

<blank>

I thought there would be more backlash than there usually is, but Braid senior's humanity is benevolent!　If anything, it's Misha who complains the most.

And I decided to show spatial magic as evidence here.

<blank>

"You see that displaced and broken wall over there at ......? Those are the remains of God's destruction.

<blank>

Just there, there was a collapsed wall that had been cut at an angle and shifted, so I pointed to it. Then, I invoked spatial magic. When I lifted my finger, the wall moved to its original position with a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. In addition, I fix it by attaching it to the wall.

<blank>

"Well, I've fixed it. If you want, I can shift it to the other side."

"What about ......!"

Wait a minute. Isn't this some kind of trick?　I'll go check."

<blank>

Sekko senior goes running with a few people to check it out and comes back. I decided to float softly because I didn't have enough time on my hands.

What do you think?　Does it look like a messenger of God?　And shine a little?

<blank>

I said, "Hey, it's really fixed--and wow, it's glowing and floating!　It's really fixed--and wow, it's glowing and floating!"

"Would you believe it?"

"Oh, oh ...... well, I believe you. At least, I'm sure you can cut through the castle walls as well as you originally did,...... and you're glowing something,......."

<blank>

Maybe I should have shined it from the start.

<blank>

"Let me tell you again ....... God does not allow anyone to call himself the God of Chaos. Only the real God of Chaos is allowed to call himself that. Even if it has "true" or "true" on it, it is not allowed, and God will punish it."

<blank>

It's more like true or fighting. Really, why did you call yourself the king of the new alchemical kingdom, the true god of chaos?

<blank>

You have three days. Give me the false God of Chaos, or I will destroy your country!　So let's sacrifice only the true God of Chaos to minimize the damage at least!　You hear me? !"

<blank>

Hey, don't throw your dignity away so suddenly!　and Blade-senpai glares at me, but I don't have time to mend things!

Find them and I'll catch them with my spatial magic!　Please, guys!
