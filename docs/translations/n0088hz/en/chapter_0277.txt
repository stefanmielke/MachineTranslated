# Please, everyone!!

After that, the hired adventurers returned to eat senior's meal.

Oh. Senior Shildon and Senior Sekko are also mixed in.

<b>

"Hey, I've got some pretty crazy news. It's fine to listen while eating, so hear me out."

"What's up, Blade?"

"Hm? By the way, who is that?"

<b>

I am disguised as a healer in advance. There's no need to reveal that I am a divine apostle to anyone other than the seniors.

<b>

"Apparently... the god is furious... at the new king of this country."

"Huh?"

"...Seriously?"

<b>

At Blade's words, the gaze of most of the members gathered here turns to me, who has no acquaintance with them. The appearance of a healer is highly suspicious. After all, looking into the robe reveals a darkness where the face cannot be seen.

<b>

"Blade. Is that person involved?"

"Yeah. This person is... an apostle. They came to deliver the words of the god."

"No way! I can't believe it!! Show me proof!!"

<b>

Hey, Misha, don't sneak over to that side. I didn't ask you to rely on Sakura!

<b>

"Right. Even if you say it's a god, I can't believe it just like that."

"It's much more believable that they're lying, right?"

"…But I can't believe that Blade would trust a lie or nonsense without any basis. There must be something, right?"

<b>

I thought there would be more backlash, but Blade's charisma is impressive!! In fact, the one complaining the most is Misha.

So, I decided to show evidence here by using space magic.

<b>

"…Over there, there's a castle wall that is misaligned and broken. That is the mark left by the god's destruction—"

<b>

At that moment, there was a wall that had been cut diagonally and collapsed, so I pointed to it. Then, I activated the space magic. As I lifted my finger, the wall moved back to its original position with a shudder. I also fixed it while I was at it.

<b>

"—There, I've fixed it. If you wish, should I shift it to the other side?"

"…Huh!?"

"Wait, wait a minute. Is this some kind of trick? I’ll go check."

<b>

Senior Sekko ran off with a few people to confirm and returned. With nothing to do, I decided to float lightly.

How's that? Does it look like a divine messenger? Should I shine a bit too?

<b>

"Hey! It really was fixed—whoa, you're glowing and floating!?"

"Do you think you can believe me now?"

"Y-yeah... well, I believe you. At least, you can probably cut the wall like it was before... and you're glowing..."

<b>

Maybe I should have been glowing from the start.

<b>

"…Let me convey this again. The god does not permit anyone to claim the title of the Chaos God. Only the real Chaos God may bear that name. Even if it has 'true' attached, it's not allowed, and punishment will be given."

<b>

Rather, it feels like 'true' is provoking a fight. Seriously, why did the new king of the Alchemy Kingdom claim to be the True Chaos God?

<b>

"The deadline is three days. Hand over the false Chaos God, or I will destroy the country completely! So at least, to minimize the damage, let's offer only the True Chaos God as a sacrifice! Right?"

<b>

Hey, don't suddenly throw away your dignity! Senior Blade glares at me, but I don't have the luxury to cover it up!

If you find me, I'll catch you with space magic!! Please, everyone!!
