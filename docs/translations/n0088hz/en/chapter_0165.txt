# The Five Great Old Shocks

At God's urging, I delivered the socks.

The highlight of this year's event was the dwarf girls' socks obtained at Aisia's village.

One of the best is my local wife, Godairo's Rejuvenation Socks.

<blank>

First, the socks of the dwarves.

<blank>

Wow!　That's a lot of volume! ...... Oh, but I don't feel any shame at all. I just pick them up when I'm feeling a little hungry."

<blank>

The dwarfs did not seem to like their socks very much.

...... It seems that the dwarves in the village, who are usually sexually promiscuous, did not feel shame to the extent of taking off their socks.

<blank>

Oh, but sometimes there are small bites. Why?"

Why, that's my question, though. Weren't there some kids like that?"

Well, you'll know when you eat it. Munch."

<blank>

Yeah, I'm getting a little used to little girls sucking on my socks without hesitation.

And God analyzing the information left in the sock while chewing.

<blank>

'Ah, a child after being shown the disarray of the Five Elders. I see."

"Disorderly ......!　I've been making those girls so disruptive!"

I said, "Well, that's great. Look, I exchanged catalogs with the massage guy before."

<blank>

Ah, that one.

<blank>

"Yeah, let's make it 100 SPs for all of them."

If you've got a small jackpot, give me a little more for my money."

I try to keep the numbers close together, because I tend to forget the smallest numbers.

<blank>

Oh, by the way, what SP did I just set?　and the God who speaks anxiously.

<blank>

It's 1050 sp. including now. Don't forget."

'Yes, you are correct. Now that was a test of your honesty, Karina, wasn't it?　Really, really."

<blank>

It sounds fake, but if it's really true, it feels like you've avoided a pinch.

<blank>

<blank>

Now then, it's finally time for the Five Great Old Showering Female Terrier Socks!

<blank>

God lays out 5 pairs of socks. And ......

His wry smile turned to a look of anguish, as if he was biting down on a bitter bug.

<blank>

"...... ugh. This is a big failure. This is a huge fail, Carina-chan. ......!"

What? Did you do something wrong?"

I'm sure you've had your own potion, Karina-chan!　Three of them have been completely overwritten and are now Carina-chan flavored ......!　One of them is just a little confused because I undressed her first. ......

<blank>

Then he pipped three feet of my flavor toward me. Oops. Catch.

<blank>

I'll return those three. I'm refusing to assess them. ...... gsn"

I'm sorry.

No. It was my fault for not telling you beforehand. It is my fault for not telling you beforehand. I don't want to make a negative assessment this time. ......Wow, I'm a little shocked because I was expecting Godairo-chan. It's as shocking as stepping on a land mine CP."

<blank>

Wait a minute. Did you just casually say that if I do it again, it will be a negative assessment?

Hmmm, I'll have to be really careful with potions in the future: ......

<blank>

Hah, I'll savor and eat just the right pair like this slime. Hmmm, let's put them together and make it 90 sp. Hmmm, I wonder if this will take about 5 years to get rid of the Carina-chan flavor. It's going to be even thicker if I give it an extra shot. ......"

<blank>

Yeah, I guess I'll drink extra if it rejuvenates me. I might as well give up the socks of the dwarves who gave out the potions.

And we need to nail them down so they don't spread the word to others.

<blank>

Why did you make her drink it?　If all I wanted was rejuvenation, a massage would have sufficed.

"You can make me feel younger just by massaging me!"

It's Lv5," he said. If you pet them all over their body, their skin and magic power will be at its peak. It won't extend your lifespan, but it will make you last longer because you won't have any physical ailments.

<blank>

The fact that the Lv5 massage was more awesome than I thought it would be. That's a lot of money for 500 SP.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, this brings the total to 1140 SP.

<blank>

"Oh, ....... I'm sick of fractions, so please use 140 sp. Here."

What? Is it forced use time again?"

Because, Karina, if you don't do this, she will save it up and not spend it."

<blank>

God looks a little grumpy. The shock of the Great Five Elders must be lingering in the air.

I don't think they're going to let me leave if I don't use this: ......

<blank>

"Would you like to take a tamer's skill?　You can share your vision with Arthur.

If all you want to do is share your vision, spatial magic will suffice.

You can even play dragons by possessing them. I'll give you a little extra, and put you at lvl. 2."

Oh, that sounds fun."

And then he'd share his senses with the slime, and he'd do this and that with the girls.

I'll buy it!

<blank>

Chariot, 1000 SP remaining.

I can't deny that I feel like I'm being rolled around in the palm of God's hand, but I don't mind being rolled around by the Loligods, so I decided to take their recommendation.
