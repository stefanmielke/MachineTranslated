# Five Great Elders Shock

At the urging of the deity, I delivered the socks.

The highlight this time is the socks of the dwarves I obtained in the land of Aisia.

Among them, my local wife, the rejuvenating socks of the Five Great Elders, are my top recommendation.

<b>

First, the socks of the dwarves.

<b>

"Yay! There are so many! ...Ah, but they don't have any sense of shame at all. Maybe I'll nibble on them when I'm feeling peckish."

<b>

It seems the dwarves didn't find the socks very appealing.

...It appears that the dwarves from the village, who are generally promiscuous, didn't feel any shame from just taking off their socks.

<b>

"Ah, but sometimes there are small hits. Why is that?"

"Why, that's what I want to ask! Didn't some of them feel that way?"

"Well, you'll understand if you try them. Munch."

<b>

Yeah, I've gotten a bit used to seeing a young girl nibble on socks without hesitation.

And while chewing, the deity analyzes the information left on the socks.

<b>

"Ah, this is from the child who was shown the debauchery of the Five Great Elders. I see."

"Debauchery...!? Did I really make those kids that wild!?"

"Of course. Remember that massage catalog we exchanged before?"

<b>

Ah, that thing.

<b>

"Okay, let's set the total at 100 SP."

"If there are small hits, can you give me a little more as a bonus?"

"I tend to forget the finer details, so I round it to a nice number."

<b>

Wait, what SP was I at again? The deity mutters, feeling anxious.

<b>

"With the current total, it's 1050 SP. Don't forget that."

"Yeah, that's correct. That was a test of Karina-chan's honesty, you know? Really, really."

<b>

It sounds suspicious, but if it's really true, it feels like I've avoided a pinch.

<b>

<b>

"Now, let's get to the rejuvenating female socks of the Five Great Elders!"

<b>

The deity lays out five pairs of socks. And then...

From a cheerful smile, it suddenly shifts to a pained expression, as if biting into a bitter bug.

<b>

"...Ugh. This is a huge failure. This is a massive failure, Karina-chan...!!"

"What? Did I do something wrong?"

"Karina-chan, you made them drink a potion made from your own materials, didn't you!? Three of them have been completely overwritten and now taste like Karina-chan...! One was already taken off, so it's just a bit of confusion...!"

<b>

Saying that, she flicked the three socks that had my flavor towards me. Whoa. Caught it.

<b>

"I'll return those three. Refusal of assessment... sniff."

"S-sorry about that."

"No, it's my fault for not saying it beforehand. I won't give you a negative assessment this time... Ugh, I was really looking forward to the Five Great Elders, so I'm a bit shocked. It's as shocking as stepping on a landmine CP."

<b>

Wait a minute. Did you just casually say there would be a negative assessment next time?

Hmm, I really need to be careful with potion handling from now on...

<b>

"Haah, I'll savor this perfectly good sock like dried squid. Hmm, let's set it at 90 SP. Hmm, I wonder if it will take about five years for the Karina-chan flavor to wear off. If I make them drink more, it might get even stronger..."

<b>

Yeah, if it's about rejuvenation, they might want to drink more. It might be better to give up on the socks of the dwarves who got the potion.

And I need to firmly warn others not to spread it around.

<b>

"Why did you make them drink it? If it was just for rejuvenation, the massage would have been enough."

"You can rejuvenate just with a massage!?"

"Well, it's level 5. If you caress the whole body, the skin and magic power will be all fresh. It won't extend their lifespan, but it will eliminate physical discomfort, so they last longer."

<b>

The level 5 massage was more amazing than I expected. No wonder it costs 500 SP.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, this brings the total to 1140 SP.

<b>

"...Ah. The odd number feels off, so please use 140 SP here."

"What? Another forced usage time?"

"Because Karina-chan wouldn't spend it otherwise."

<b>

The deity looks slightly displeased. The shock from the Five Great Elders is probably lingering.

It seems like she won't let me go unless I use it...

<b>

"How about taking the Tamer skill? You can share vision with Arthur-kun and all."

"Just sharing vision is enough with spatial magic."

"You can possess and play dragon games too. I'll give you a little bonus and set it to level 2."

"Oh, that sounds fun."

"And you can share senses with a slime and do all sorts of things with girls."

"I'll buy it!!!"

<b>

Ching, remaining 1000 SP.

I can't deny the feeling of being rolled around in the deity's palm, but I don't mind being rolled around by the loli deity, so I decided to take her recommendation.
