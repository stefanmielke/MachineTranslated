# Of Chaos

However, the maid homunculus retracted the insect just 5 cm in front of me.

<b>

"...... Just kidding. It's a joke. If we're talking about an intelligence humanoid artifact, its rank is the highest. An insect like this wouldn't affect me; it would just poke around in my brain."

<b>

Ah, that was close... I thought my adventure was going to end here...!

<b>

"...... Meow, if a person has their brain poked around, wouldn't they die?"

"That is not something my master desires, so no."

<b>

Saying that, the maid homunculus tucked the caterpillar into the pocket of her maid outfit.

<b>

"Hey, Lena. Just to check, am I not the master here?"

"Yes, you are indeed the master."

"What's that response? Does it mean that 'master' is different from 'my master'?"

"I'll leave that to your imagination, my master... However, my master would like to meet you."

<b>

It seems that Kaoru is not the master.

<b>

"Then excuse me, my master."

"Ugh."

<b>

The maid homunculus strikes Kaoru's neck with a knife-hand. Is that how you do it from the front? Normally, it’s from the side, right? I don't know.

<b>

"...... Hmph!"

<b>

With a crack, Kaoru breaks free from the restraints and rises from the bed. ...Her hair color had turned red.

<b>

"...... My throat hurts, Lena?"

"Yes, my master. I knocked you out by hitting your throat."

"Oh, I see... Ah, ah. Yeah, it seems I can talk without any problem."

<b>

With a snap, Kaoru frees me from my restraints.

<b>

"Oh? ...What’s up, Kaoru... no, it's not Kaoru, is it?"

"Yes, that's correct."

<b>

I sit on the bed and look at the one smiling at me.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, Apostle of Chaos. I am the Demon Lord of Chaos."

"Ah. ...The real Chaos is here!?"

"Wait. You mustn't call that name. Even if I'm in stealth mode, I can still be detected."

<b>

A hand covers my mouth. It's soft... whoa...! Even though my mouth is just covered, it feels strangely tingly and nice...!? It smells good!

<b>

"Got it? I am the Demon Lord of Chaos. Understand?"

<b>

Nodding, my mouth is slowly uncovered.

<b>

"...... Um, so. Demon Lord of Chaos?"

"OK, that's fine."

<b>

The Demon Lord of Chaos lets out a sigh.

Then, she takes out something that looks like a sock.

<b>

"I'll be brief since time is short. --The demon behind you. I want you to seal her. I've prepared an artifact in the form of a sock that will prevent her from interfering with this world for about 100 years."

"...... Um? A sock-type artifact... is that what you mean?"

"With this, it will definitely work, right?"

<b>

Yeah, this will definitely catch her. You could say it's a divine artifact against that god.

She seems to know the circumstances around this... this is the real deal.

<b>

"Don't worry, I'll provide energy while she's being eliminated, so the world won't perish. But I want you to continue retrieving artifacts."

<b>

She seems to know the circumstances around this... this is the real deal. (Second time)

<b>

<b>

"...... But, um, why? I heard she was a lover."

"............"

<b>

The Demon Lord of Chaos presses her forehead.

<b>

"Um?"

"...... That girl, is she what they call a yandere...? Don't you think I want at least a little freedom?"

"Ah, yes."

<b>

What is this, a love entanglement? How ridiculous! ...Ah, no, it's not ridiculous. Please save my life!!

<b>

"Ah. It's not necessary for you to cooperate with me or anything like that. I'll just use you as I please. ...I'll have to tamper with your memory to keep our meeting a secret, though."

"Brain cu-!? Brain cu is a bit much! I don't want that!"

"Don't worry. I'm a professional. Also, I won't actually open your head; it'll just be a little magic."

<b>

Oh, if that's the case, then I'm fine with it. Teacher, please take care of me!

<b>

"Then, Lena. Accompany this girl as the 'mastermind.'"

"Understood, my master."

"Alright then, vessel of the time god. I'll tidy up your memory for you."

<b>

Saying that, the Demon Lord of Chaos closed her eyes, and her hair color returned to Kaoru's blonde.
