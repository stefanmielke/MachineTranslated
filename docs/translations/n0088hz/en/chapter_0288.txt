# of chaos.

However, 5cm in front of me, the maid homunculus retracted the insect.

<blank>

I'm not sure what you mean by "...... Naan chattte. It is a joke. When it comes to intelligence humanoid divine weapons, its rank is the highest. This bug won't work, it will just pick your brain."

<blank>

Oh, oh no...... I thought my adventure would end here......!

<blank>

......, I wonder if people die when their brains are picked?"

'Because that is not what my Lord would have me do.

<blank>

With that, the maid homunculus tucked the caterpillar inside the breast pocket of her maid's uniform.

<blank>

Hey, Lena. Just out of curiosity, am I not your master?"

Yes, the master is the master."

Which is that reply? Do you mean to say that the master is 'master' and therefore different from 'lord'?"

I would say, "As you might imagine, Master ......, but my Lord would like to see you."

<blank>

Apparently, Kaoru is not the Lord.

<blank>

Now, if you'll excuse me, Master."

Goooooood."

<blank>

A maid homunculus puts a hand sword into Kaoru's neck. Is that supposed to be done from the front?　Isn't it usually done from the neck?　I don't know.

<blank>

"...... hmph!"

<blank>

With a snap, Kaoru breaks the restraints and gets up from the bed!　and breaking through the restraints, Kaoru gets up from the bed. The color of her ...... hair had turned red.

<blank>

I have a sore throat from ......, Lena?"

Yes, my Lord. I have knocked him out by the throat."

"Oh yeah, ...... uh, uh. Yeah, it looks like you have no problem speaking."

<blank>

With a snap, Kaoru snaps his fingers and my restraints are removed.

<blank>

'Oh? What is ......, Kaoru ......, no, not Kaoru, no?"

Yes, that's right. That's right."

<blank>

I sit on my bed and look at him smiling.

<blank>

Nice to meet you, demon apostle. I am the Demon Lord of Chaos ......."

Oh. ...... real chaos, too!"

Stop. Don't call me that name. Even if you are deploying Mr. Koshori, it will be detected.

<blank>

A hand covers his mouth. It's soft ...... and soft ......!　Even though his mouth is covered with his hand, it feels strangely zingy and nice. ......!　It smells good!

<blank>

May I?"　I am the Demon Lord of Chaos. Okay?"

<blank>

I nodded my head and my hand slowly moved away.

<blank>

"...... Um, you know. Mr. Demon Lord of Chaos?"

Okay, that's fine.

<blank>

The Demon Lord of Chaos huffed and puffed.

Then he takes out some socks.

<blank>

'I'll be brief, since we're short on time. -The demon behind you. I want you to seal her up. I've prepared a sacred object in the sock that Lena wears that will prevent her from interfering in this world for about a hundred years."

"You mean ...... uh?　You mean the sock-shaped divine ......?"

This would definitely take, right?"

<blank>

Yeah, this is definitely catching on. I'd say it's that God special effect.

You know what's going on in that area. ...... This is the real deal.

<blank>

Don't worry, I'll take care of the energy supply while you're eliminating them so the world won't perish either. I want you to keep collecting the sacred artifacts, though."

<blank>

You know what's going on around here. ...... This is the real deal. (For the second time)

<blank>

<blank>

"...... but, I mean, why?　I heard you were a sweetheart."

"............"

<blank>

The Demon Lord of Chaos pressing his brow.

<blank>

Uh?"

"...... she's what you'd call a yandere,......?　Don't you think I could use a little freedom too?"

"Ah, hi."

<blank>

What is this, a love affair? It's crap! ...... Oh, no, it's not crap. All you have to do is save my life!

<blank>

You don't have to cooperate or not cooperate with me. You don't have to cooperate with me or not. I'm just going to use you. You don't have to tell anyone you met me at ...... so I can play with your memories."

Brain cuchu!　Brain cuchu is indeed a little bit!　I don't want to be hit!"

Don't worry. I'm a professional. I'm not going to open your head, I'm just going to use my magic.

<blank>

Oh, that's all right then. I look forward to working with you, doctor.

<blank>

Then, Rena, you will accompany her as 'mastermind'. You will accompany her as the 'mastermind'."

"Yes, my Lord."

"So long, Time God's dependents. I'll keep your memory in order."

<blank>

With that, the Demon Lord of Chaos closed his eyes and his hair color returned to Kaoru's blonde locks.

<blank>

<blank>
