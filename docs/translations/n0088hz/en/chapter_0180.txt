# If I told everything honestly, the king would cry, right?

<b>

Well then.

Setting aside the preparations for the return ceremony in the dwarf kingdom of Tesshin, let's talk about the fake "Wall-Breaking Hammer" stolen by the phantom thief Hermes.

<b>

I received a message from Maria, the former lord's wife of Verald, saying, "I've recovered the sacred artifact, so please accept it." There were some complications during that time, apparently.

<b>

...Yeah, well, one of those complications, the mysterious man pursuing the sacred artifact, is me.

For now, I sent a letter as a prelude and came to Verald.

There's a post office nearby, so it's easy to get here.

<b>

"Maria, are you there?"

"I've been waiting, Kari-chan. Ah, it's turned into quite a headache, hasn't it?"

<b>

When I entered the room, preparations for a tea party were underway.

The host was Maria, dressed in a modest, low-exposure house dress. The embroidery done in thread of the same color as the fabric was elegant, making it clear at a glance that she was of noble status.

<b>

Well, the way she was leaning on the table and beckoning me casually made it feel relaxed.

<b>

Since the old lady maid, a friend from the bath, pulled out a chair for me, I casually greeted her with "Thanks" and sat down.

<b>

"Sorry about that. I was just busy with various things in Tesshin."

"Was it about the return ceremony mentioned in the letter? Well then, let's see if we can figure out where it was dropped."

<b>

Yeah, after briefly discussing the situation in the letter, we decided to investigate the drop-off point.

<b>

The king and others have their own face and circumstances. He must have been prepared to go to such a dangerous place himself.

If it all turns out to be a blunder due to my lack of communication... and to top it off, the one we got was a fake?

<b>

If I told everything honestly, the king would cry, right? He seems like such a nice person.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, should Mi-chan join us too? Should I call her?"

"…Wait a moment. Who is this Mi-chan?"

"Um… she's a dwarf girl. What was her real name again… oh, right, the queen?"

"Vermilion-sama!? Don't joke around, that's just too disrespectful!"

<b>

Maria, flustered, made a small clink with the teapot.

Her surprise was so refined; if it were me, I would have spat out my tea.

<b>

"Well, I met Maria in the bath, you know? I didn't know at first, but I ended up making her my local wife. So if I call her, she'll come right away. She's a good kid, so it's fine."

"Please, my stomach can't take it. Local wife? What did you do... no, it's fine, you don't have to say. Ah, I'm feeling dizzy."

<b>

Saying that, Maria pressed her eyes.

Sorry about that. No, I really feel bad, just a little.

<b>

"Well, you said you'd leave everything to me, so I guess it's fine."

"Hey, that means you're a full-fledged ambassador, doesn't it? That's a huge responsibility..."

<b>

Anyway, I shared the situation again.

We will hold the "Sacred Artifact Return Ceremony" next weekend. The real one is in Tesshin, and Hermes stole the fake. Mi-chan is cute. Dia-kun is an angel. Also, I recently started raising a dragon and a slime. Well, the latter part was mostly chit-chat.

<b>

"…I thought I wouldn't be surprised anymore, but more and more keeps coming up."

"Ahaha, it's a fun daily life. I thank the gods for it."

<b>

From Maria, I also heard that Dia-kun's older sister, Ms. Cumin, is having various troubles. Speaking of which, I still have her luggage stored.

<b>

I sipped my tea and ate a biscuit.

A gentle sweetness spread in my mouth. Yum... I might want to eat this with some cheese.

<b>

"About the fake sacred artifact, it would help if it could be received as if it were the real thing. Also, I want to keep that part secret; I don't want it to be public. It's a problem if the king is said to have stolen it."

"Then I'll go dressed as a healer. Oh, the mysterious man pursuing the sacred artifact, that's my disguise."

"Is that so?"

<b>

Oh. I thought my disguise was perfect, but Maria figured it out just by hearing the story.

<b>

"I knew it from the moment I received the letter. Well, there's also the fact that I don't know anyone who can perfectly slip past the royal guards and come in and out of the room while being somewhat clumsy."

"Heh, maybe it was because I was too amazing that it was the deciding factor?"

"In the end, King-sama said he didn't know what you came for."

<b>

Yeah, I actually intended to collect it at that time, but I accidentally forgot. Sorry.

<b>

"Also, I heard you said something like 'Stealing is not good'? King-sama was quite concerned about that. He wondered if you were perhaps a divine messenger and if divine punishment would come down."

"Yeah, I said that. I did."

<b>

I remember it well because I said it while putting myself on a pedestal.

<b>

"Could you say something like 'As a reward, I'll let it go this time' during the handover of the sacred artifact? I'll give Kari-chan something as a thank you."

"Okay, that's fine. Oh, can you wrap up these tea snacks for me? Everyone will definitely be happy with the biscuits. It would be great if there was cheese too; if we eat it together, I think Mi-chan and the others will be happy as it goes well with alcohol."

"…Geez, you're such a softie. I'll give you new ones in cans, take as many as you want."

<b>

Wow, so generous! As expected of the former lord's wife! Thank you!

I'm really glad it seems to be wrapping up nicely. As expected of Maria.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

----------------

(In exchange for several cans of biscuits, Maria sells favors to the king and Karina-chan. What a great skill...!)
