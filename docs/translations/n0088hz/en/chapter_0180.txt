# If I were to be honest about everything, the king would cry.

<blank>

Well, well, well.

Aside from Tessin, the Land of the Dwarves, where the return ceremony is being prepared, we will discuss the fake "Breaking Wall Hammer" that was stolen by the thief Hermes.

<blank>

This is Grandma Maria, the former wife of the former Lord of Velarde, who contacted me to say that she had recovered a sacred artifact and wanted me to receive it. There may have been some dispute at that time.

<blank>

...... Yeah. Well, what the heck. One of the agonizing things, the mysterious man chasing the sacred object, is me.

At any rate, I sent the letter as a preemptive step and then came to Velarde.

I've left a post box so I can go right to it...............

<blank>

Grandma Maria, are you there?"

I've been waiting for you, Kari. Huh, you're giving me a headache."

<blank>

When I entered the room, a tea party was being prepared.

The host is Grandma Maria, wearing a dress that is less revealing and more roomy. The dress is richly embroidered with threads of the same color as the cloth, which is very prestigious, and one can tell at a glance that she is a noblewoman.

<blank>

Well, it's not so easy when you have one elbow on the table and beckon to them every once in a while.

<blank>

My bath friend, a lady attendant, pulled out a chair for me, and I greeted her lightly with a "Hi, how are you?" and sat down.

<blank>

I'm sorry. I was just doing some stuff in Tessin."

Was it the return ceremony mentioned in the letter?　Well, let's see if we can find a way to get rid of it."

<blank>

Yeah, I lightly told him about the situation in a letter, and he decided to find out where he dropped it off.

<blank>

The king and others have their own faces and circumstances. I'm sure he was prepared to go all the way to such an unsafe place.

And that's all due to my lack of communication, like a poke or something. ...... And the one I got is a fake, man.

<blank>

If I were to be honest about everything, the king would cry. He seems like such a nice guy.

<blank>

<blank>

Should Mee be there too?　Do you want me to call her?"

I'm at ......, wait a minute. Who is this Mee-chan?"

'Let's see, ...... she's a Dwarf girl. What did you say your real name was? ...... Uh, well, Queen?"

"Lord Vermillion?　You've got to be kidding me, that's a little too much disrespect!"

<blank>

Old Maria is upset and clinks her tea utensils with a small clink.

Your surprise is so elegant, I'd probably spew tea if I were you.

<blank>

I met Old Maria in the bathtub, right?　I didn't know it, but I made her my local wife. So if you call her, she'll come right away. Don't worry, she's a good girl.

'Don't do it, it'll cut my stomach. Local wife?　What did you do ...... No, no, no, don't tell me. Oh, I'm dizzy."

<blank>

Old Maria pressed her eyes with that.

I'm kind of sorry. No really, I feel bad, just a little bit.

<blank>

'Well, he said he'd leave it all up to me, so I don't really care.'

I'm not sure I'd be able to do that. That's a lot of responsibility. ......"

<blank>

Anyway, I share the situation again.

That the "Divine Artifact Returning Ceremony" be held the following weekend. That the one in Tessin is the real one and that Hermes had the fake one stolen. That Mee is cute. Dia is an angel. And that they have started keeping a new dragon and a slime. Well, the second half was mostly chat.

<blank>

......, you'd think I wouldn't be surprised anymore, but they just keep popping up."

I'm having a great time every day. Thank God."

<blank>

I heard from Grandma Maria that Dia's sister, Ms. Kumin, was having a lot of trouble while chatting. Well, I guess she still has her luggage with her.

<blank>

I drink a cup of tea and eat a cookie as a snack.

A slight sweetness spread in my mouth. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. I might want to eat this with some ...... cheese.

<blank>

I'd appreciate it if you would accept the fake vessels as authentic. "I would also like to keep it a secret and not make it public," he said. It would also be a problem if the king had them stolen.

I'll go out dressed as a healer. Oh, you mean the mysterious man chasing after the sacred artifact, because that's my disguise."

I knew it!

<blank>

Oh. I thought it was a perfect disguise, but I guess old Maria knew just by listening to you.

<blank>

I knew when I got the letter. Well, I didn't know anyone else who could slip in and out of a room perfectly well protected by the Kingsguard and still be somewhat ditzy.

'Huh, I guess the deciding factor is that I'm too awesome?'

Mr. King said he didn't know what he was doing here after all.

<blank>

Yeah, I was actually going to collect it right there, but I accidentally forgot. Sorry.

<blank>

I heard you said something about 'thieves are not good.　King was very concerned about it. He was wondering if it was a messenger of God, and if there would be a divine punishment.

You said it. I told you."

<blank>

I remember it well because I put myself on the shelf and said it.

<blank>

I would like you to say something like, "When you hand over the sacred artifact to Kari, I would like you to say, 'As a reward, I forgive you for this one time.　I'll give you something in return.

I'm fine with that. Oh, can you wrap up these tea cakes?　I'm sure everyone will enjoy the cookies. I hope you have some cheese, too, because it goes well with alcohol, and I think Mee and the others will like it.

I'll give you a new can, and you can have as many as you want. I'll give you a can of the new stuff, take as much as you want."

<blank>

Oh, fatty!　That's the former wife of a former lord!　Thank you!

Well, I'm glad it seems to have come full circle. That's what I expected from Grandma Maria.

<blank>

(Old Maria sells her favors to the king and Karina in exchange for a few cans of cookies. Great job, ......!)

The following is a notice...

The official X account is currently conducting a survey to determine who will be the character for the electronic bonus SS!

I would be happy if you could spread and introduce this novel to the rest of the world so that there will be two more volumes.

What, what do I have to do?
