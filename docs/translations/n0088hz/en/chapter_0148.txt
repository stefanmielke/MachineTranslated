# Was the species recommended?

I quickly learned the dragon language from the catalog: ...... Oh, this is the type of skill that allows you to talk to dragons while they consume magic power.

Activate the skill and talk to the dragon again.

'In. Why were you chasing that carriage?　I've learned to speak dragon, so you can speak it as it is.'

'Ah, Miss!　The language of dragons!　You mean you've mastered it in this short time, how smart you are, great!'

<blank>

I was called Miss.

<blank>

I'm actually in heat, you know. ...... I got hit once by her and came to my senses.　Normally I'm mild-mannered and harmless, except when I'm attacked.

I see. I see.　Does that mean you were chasing that big iguana-like lizard to ask him to marry you?'

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　That's a male!　She is a nice, white girl on the back side!　She had such a soft body that I couldn't wait to hug her!

<blank>

That's a carriage. It's a covered horse.

<blank>

You don't have to look at me like that, I know I'm not a dragon.　There is a reason for this. You see, dragons are basically the strongest creatures, aren't they?

I think it's hilarious that he's the strongest creature in the world after being one-upped by me.

Miss is too strong!　And the Dragon King told me not to increase the number unnecessarily. So a horse-drawn carriage was recommended as an alternative to sex drive. ......

I see."

<blank>

Was it a species recommendation or a dragon car something?

<blank>

I was not expecting her to be defeated by a single blow!　I didn't think she would be beaten with a single blow. ...... Oh, her fangs are broken. I'm so depressed.

'Ahh. Let's just stick it on, shall we?　You can do that kind of thing, can't you, me?'

I was surprised that you can use recovery magic even though you have such a strong body. I appreciate the sentiment, but ordinary recovery magic doesn't work on dragons. They have high magic resistance.

'Which one? ...... Yeah, it's stuck!'

'............ Wow, seriously!　Who are you, Miss?

<blank>

I tried it and it stuck normally. Well, it's not ordinary recovery magic, it's God's magic.

<blank>

'Well, if you've come to your senses, you're all right now. Go home.

Are you sure?"

'I can't bring myself to kill someone I've talked to so openly. I'm not that much of an ogre, okay?"

I was surprised to hear that she was a half-organ. That's why you are so powerful!

Correction. I'm not a demon. My race is human. ...... maybe."

<blank>

She is supposed to be a normal beautiful girl except for her magical power level, which only allows her to use invincible space magic. In terms of specs.

<blank>

<blank>

There it is!　There's the dragon!

Hmm?"

<blank>

I looked in the direction of the voice and saw a group of dwarves in full armor charging toward us. They were riding a giant, quadrupedal tortoise that looked like a giant, flattened Zenigame - a cavalry beast that runs so fast that it blasts off at a habitual pace that it produces a cloud of dust - and they were standing on their niohs.

<blank>

Oh no!　Oh no, I'm a dwarf, I've been found!　Help me, Miss!

'Hey, don't hide behind me!　I had nothing to do with this!"

I don't like ningen because if you kill them, they will attack you in packs until you run out of power!　Ah, maybe that corpse was found. The one who stomped the adventurer who sniffed her aphrodisiac. ......

<blank>

What's with the adventurers? He got what he deserved.

Because we were carefree in our argument, the Thunder Dragon and I were surrounded by dwarves. However, the sky is still open, so we could escape if we wanted to. ...... No, run away. Why are you curled up behind me.

<blank>

Oh, a guy with a great beard who seemed to be a representative of the dwarves spoke to me while standing on a turtle.

<blank>

We are the Knights of the Tessin Mobile Tortoise. We are the Knights of the Tessin Mobile Tortoise. Why is the dragon behind you?"

Help me, Miss!　These guys are a real nuisance, hide me!

<blank>

And the Thunder Dragon that clings to you. What a pity. What the hell, I can't help it.

<blank>

<blank>

I see that ...... is the Knights of the Mobile Turtle. Oh, it's called Dodai Turtle?　It's a moving foundation. Wow, there's such a thing?

<blank>
