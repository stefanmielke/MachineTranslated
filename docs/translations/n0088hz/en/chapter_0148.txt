# Was it a Racial Recommendation?

I quickly learned the Dragon language from the catalog... Oh, this is a skill that lets me talk to dragons while consuming magical power.

I activated the skill and spoke to the dragon again.

<b>

"So, why were you chasing that carriage? You can just talk since you learned the Dragon language."

"Oh, sister! You learned the Dragon language!? Did you really master it in such a short time? What a smart person you are, amazing!"

<b>

So, I was being called sister.

<b>

"Well, actually, I've entered my mating season... and after being punched by you, I regained my sanity? Normally, I'm gentle and harmless, but, well, if attacked, that's different."

"I see. Huh? So you were chasing that big iguana-like lizard to propose to it?"

"No, no, that's outrageous! That's a male! More than that, it's the lovely white one behind! I couldn't help but want to hug that soft body!"

<b>

That's a carriage. It's a draft horse.

<b>

"I know I'm not a dragon just by looking at me, right? There's a reason for this. You see, dragons are basically the strongest creatures, right?"

"It's laughable that you call yourself the strongest creature after being knocked out by me."

"You're just too strong, sister!! And, to prevent reckless breeding, the Dragon King issued an order. So, as a substitute for releasing sexual desire, carriages are recommended..."

"I see?"

<b>

So it was a racial recommendation for dragon carriages or something.

<b>

"Still, sister, you were really strong! I never thought I'd be taken down in one hit... Oh, my fangs are broken. I'm bummed."

"Ah. Should I fix them? I can do that, you know."

"Wow, sister, you have such a strong body and can use healing magic too. I appreciate the sentiment, but regular healing magic doesn't work on dragons. Our magical resistance is high."

"Let me see? ... Yeah, it's fixed!"

"......Wow, it's true! Who are you, sister!?"

<b>

When I tried it, it fixed normally. Well, it's not regular healing magic; it's divine magic after all.

<b>

"Well, if you've returned to your senses, then you should be fine now. Go home."

"Eh, is that okay?"

"I can't bring myself to kill someone I've talked to so casually. I'm not that much of a demon, you know?"

"So you're a half-ogre, sister. No wonder you're so strong!"

"Correction. I'm not a demon. My race is human. ...Probably."

<b>

I should just be an ordinary beautiful girl aside from being able to use invincible space magic. In terms of specs.

<b>

<b>

"There it is! A dragon!!"

"Huh?"

<b>

When I looked in the direction of the voice, fully armored dwarves were charging towards us. They were riding on a giant turtle that looked like a flat-shelled turtle, running at such speed that it kicked up dust—like a beast of burden.

<b>

"Yikes!? Oh no, it's dwarves, I've been spotted! Help me, sister!!"

"Hey, don't hide behind me! I'm not involved!"

"Humans are troublesome because they attack in packs until we exhaust our strength! Ah, they probably found that corpse. The adventurer who made me sniff aphrodisiac...”

<b>

What, was it the adventurer's doing? Serves him right.

Since I was casually arguing like that, the Thunder Dragon and I were surrounded by dwarves. However, since there's still space in the sky, we could escape if we wanted to... No, we should escape. Why are you curled up behind me?

<b>

Oh, a representative dwarf with a magnificent beard stood on the turtle and spoke to us.

<b>

"Hey, woman. We are the Tesshin Mobile Turtle Knight Corps. Why is a dragon behind you?"

"Help me, sister! These guys are really troublesome, hide me!"

<b>

The Thunder Dragon clung to me. How pathetic. Seriously, what a pain.

<b>

<b>

...By the way, it's the Mobile Turtle Knight Corps, huh? Wait, is it called Dodaiturtle? It's literally a moving platform. Amazing that something like this exists.
