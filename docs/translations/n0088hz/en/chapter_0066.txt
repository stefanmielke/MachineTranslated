I'm Karina. I've just returned to the storage space after making a delivery to God and stocking up on socks while I'm at it.

The pirate ship that had been delivered as a sacred artifact had been dismantled, and the wood, cargo, food, etc., which were probably left over after the sacred artifact was removed, were arranged and placed. Well, as one would expect from God, he is very careful in his work. God's care.

Oh, this bed looks nice, let's use it.

<blank>

Welcome back, sister Karina.

I'm home," she said, "I wasn't asleep yet. And that white one-piece is cute, it looks good on you.

Thank you for ......." I was kind of, you know, not sleeping."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Dear was firmly dressed in a one-piece dress. White this time.

I guess I'll just use it as a nightgown. Nice!

<blank>

Actually, there's something I didn't tell your sister: ......

Hmm?　Yes?"

<blank>

If it is a confession? The one that God said I was his first love. ......

<blank>

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　I can't go out with a guy!

Oh, no, but a guy's girl is possible!　I'm a TS bishoujo, and if you add me and divide by 2, it's just right!　What should I do?　I'm even more worried because Dia-kun is cute!

Ants, Pears, or Pears over Ants?　More ants than pears?

Ohhhh, what to do, what to do!

<blank>

...... My real name is Dia Salt Hylia Bertox. I'm sorry for not telling you until now, sister Karina.

I'm sorry, let me think about it for a minute. What's your name? I mean, what did you have to apologize for ......?　You said from the beginning you wanted a fake name."

What?　Oh, no, if it's okay with your sister Karina, that's fine."

<blank>

There is nothing wrong with the matter of hiding the name. That Dea ...... something?　At any rate, the long name suggests that he is the son of a noble family. ......

Of course, it is nothing but an ugly story that the son and daughter of a noble family were captured by pirates. It is normal to hide it.

<blank>

I'll continue to call you Dia-kun because it's prettier.　My original name is a bit long, and I want to be friends with you from now on.

"!　Ha, yes!　Of course it's good!"

<blank>

Dia, you look so happy. I'm too sleepy to remember such a long name.

It's a radiant smile.

<blank>

I said, "Oh, yes, we should make a room for us to live together. I think we should make room for us when we start living together."

"Make room, sir?"

Yes, it is. Privacy and privacy are important.

<blank>

So, first, I carved out my living space - which had always been bare - into a separate space. Then, I attached a door that had been dismantled from the pirate ship as a doorway.

If I open the door, it will lead to my room space. It will also be locked.

<blank>

--The room space is ready!

<blank>

I'll make a room like this for you, Dear."

I see. So the place will be like a living room?

'Oh, that's great. Let's build a living room too."

<blank>

Then I'd like to put a couch or something. Was it in the Pirate's Booty?

If not, let's make one.

<blank>

Dear, where would you like your room?"

I'd like to be next door to Sis Karina's room!"

Let's put them side by side. Let's see, I guess this is the door."

<blank>

The doors were lined up, with the other side being Dear's room. When I opened the door with a clunk, I found an empty white room.

If you keep the doors to the ......2 rooms open at the same time, there's obviously an area of space covered, and it's going to bug your brain. It's not possible in a real apartment or anything.

Since the spaces are different, the soundproofing is fine even if the walls are donned.

<blank>

I've made the space inside to look like that for now, but if it's not big enough, I can easily expand it, just let me know. Do you want a window?

'Yeah, where does the window lead to?'

"Hmm, a frame-up that can't be opened, but a suitable outside space?"

<blank>

When I actually turned it on, the sun's rays came through the window. This way I don't have to light up the room space itself. The curtains can be adjusted. It would be nice to have a door panel that opens inward.

<blank>

"When I look outside ......, I see that we're in the sky."

If there were windows all over town, it would be a big deal."

"Wouldn't you run into some flying demons or something?"

We'll be fine if we bump into each other."

<blank>

Well, you'll avoid the demons, too.

<blank>

Now, let's move the furniture. I'll bring the pirate's bed and chairs here. Oh, I like the closet, too. Of course, I'd like to put some pretty girls' clothes in there!　We'll put the mirror in here, too!"

Uuh, ha, yes. I'll do my best."

<blank>

If you specify that you want me to put this here, I'll use spatial magic to do it all in one shot.

You don't have to work hard, do you?

<blank>

In the meantime, I'll put the pirate's loot bed in Dear's room as well. I'll put a lamp grimoire, a table and a chair in his room. The closet, of course, should be replaced with girls' clothes.

Now it looks more than minimally roomy. Good.

<blank>

All right," he said, "Deere's room is finished. Dear, your room is done!"

"Thank you ......fu...... I'm starting to feel sleepy with relief."

'Let's go to bed for now, shall we? I'm sleepy too and ...... ah, when I wake up, let's think about the detailed layout again and play with alchemy. Good night."

Yes, good night. Good night, sister Karina."

<blank>

Dia-kun rubbed his eyes and went to his room. ...... Huh. Ah, I'm going to sleep too. Good night.
