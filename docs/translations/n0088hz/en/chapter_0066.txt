# Privacy and the Private are Important ●Illustration Included

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. I just finished delivering to the gods and, while I was at it, restocked some socks before returning to my storage space.

The pirate ship I delivered as a divine artifact was dismantled, and what remained were the wood, cargo, and food that had been stripped of their divine parts. Hmm, as expected, the gods do their work meticulously. Truly divine service.

Oh, this bed looks nice; I think I’ll use it.

<b>

“Welcome back, Karina Onee-san.”

“I’m home—wait, you’re still awake? Also, that white dress is cute; it suits you.”

“...Thank you. It’s just that, I couldn’t sleep.”

<b>

Dia-kun had changed into a dress. This time it’s white.

Is he going to use it as sleepwear? Nice!

<b>

“Actually, there’s something I haven’t told you, Onee-san…”

“Hmm? What is it?”

<b>

Could it be a confession? The one where the gods said I was his first love…

<b>

Wait? There’s no way I can date a guy!?

Oh, but maybe if he’s a cross-dressing boy, it’s okay!? If you average out my TS beautiful girl self with him, it might just be perfect!? Oh no, what should I do? I’m troubled! Dia-kun is so cute, it makes it even harder to decide!

Yes, no, more yes than no? More no than yes??

Ahhh, what should I do, what should I do!!

<b>

“...My real name is Dia Salt Hyrule Beltux. I’m sorry for keeping it a secret until now, Karina Onee-san.”

“Sorry, let me think for a moment—wait, what? It’s just a name. ...Wait, was there something to apologize for? You said from the start that a pseudonym was fine, right?”

“Eh? Ah, well, if you prefer Karina Onee-san, that’s fine with me.”

<b>

There’s no problem with hiding his name. That Dia… whatever? Judging by the long name, he’s probably a noble’s son…

It would be quite a scandal if a noble’s son or daughter got captured by pirates. It’s only natural to hide it.

<b>

“Well, since Dia-kun sounds cuter, can I keep calling you Dia-kun? The original name is a bit long, and it also means I want us to get along from now on.”

“! Y-yes! Of course, that’s fine!”

<b>

Dia-kun looked so happy. I’m sleepy, and I can’t remember such a long name anyway.

What a bright smile.

<b>

“Oh, right. Since we’ll be living together, we should make a room.”

“A room, you say?”

“Yeah. Privacy and the private are important, you know.”

<b>

So, first, I’ll divide my living space— which had been completely exposed— into a separate area. Then, I attached a door that had been dismantled from the pirate ship as the entrance.

When you open the door, it connects to my room. Of course, it can be locked.

<b>

—The room space is complete!

<b>

“I’ll make your room like this too, Dia-kun.”

“I see. So, the place we’ve been in until now will become like a living room?”

“Yeah, that sounds good. Let’s make a living room too.”

<b>

In that case, I’d like to have a sofa and such. Was there one among the pirate spoils?

If not, I’ll make one.

<b>

“Where do you want your room, Dia-kun?”

“I’d like it to be next to Karina Onee-san’s room!”

“Then let’s place them side by side. Um, is this door okay?”

<b>

I arranged the doors, making the other one Dia-kun’s room. When I opened it, a completely empty white room spread out.

…If I keep both room doors open at the same time, it’s clear that the spaces overlap, and it feels like my mind is going to glitch. That’s impossible in a real apartment.

Since the spaces are different, soundproofing will be fine even if we bang on the walls.

<b>

“I’ve made the inside spacious enough for now, but if it’s not enough, just let me know, and I can easily expand it. Do you want a window too?”

“Eh, where would the window connect to?”

“Hmm, it’s a fixed window that can’t be opened, but it connects to some random outside space?”

<b>

When I actually put it in, sunlight streamed in through the window. With this, I won’t have to light up the room space itself. I can adjust it with curtains. I could also put in an inward-opening panel.

<b>

“...Looking outside, it feels like we’re in an amazing sky.”

“If there were windows in the middle of town, it would cause a huge commotion.”

“Wouldn’t we run into flying monsters or something?”

“Even if we did, we’d be fine here, so it’s okay.”

<b>

Well, monsters would probably avoid us anyway.

<b>

“Now, let’s move the furniture. I’ll bring the beds, chairs, and such from the pirates here. Oh, a closet would be nice too. Of course, the inside will be filled with cute girls’ clothes! I’ll also put a full-length mirror here!”

“Ugh, y-yes. I’ll do my best!”

<b>

If you specify where you want me to place this, I can do it in one go with spatial magic.

There’s no need to overexert yourself, right?

<b>

For now, I’ll place a pirate spoils bed in Dia-kun’s room. A lamp magic tool, and then a table and chairs. A closet, and of course, I’ll switch out the contents for girls’ clothes.

With this, the room looks more than adequate. Alright.

<b>

“Alright. Dia-kun’s room is complete!”

“Thank you so much... yawn... I feel sleepy now that I’m feeling relieved.”

“Let’s sleep for now. I’m sleepy too... Ah, when we wake up, we can think about the detailed layout again and play with alchemy. Good night!”

“Yes, good night, Karina Onee-san.”

<b>

Dia-kun rubbed his eyes as he headed to his room. ...Yawn. Ah, I’ll sleep too. Good night.
