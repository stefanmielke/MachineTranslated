# Sorry for your concern.

(Yikes. I made a reservation submission mistake and posted two episodes)

Let's drink again. Next time I won't make you take your socks off, okay?"

Haha, see you later."

Buy some more booze!

I've had enough of that!

<blank>

My name is Karina. I said goodbye to Sati, the dwarf who became my friend.

She's a tiny, deft little thing, and she's taught me a lot.

<blank>

I mean, what the heck, commercial guild certificates allow guilds to exchange a certain amount of money in their accounts with each other.

It's amazing to see another world with electronic payment functions. Thanks to this, I'm running low on my balance.

For now, the backpack is heavy, so the sake bottles and their contents are temporarily moved to a storage space. Don't forget to tie the bottles to their contents so that they can be returned correctly.

<blank>

I heard that the price was reasonable and that they were willing to go easy on me to the extent that I could make a decent profit if I sold a little bit of everything at the private transaction level!

I heard that if you want to sell in bulk, you have to deal with a liquor store that has a license to deal in alcohol. Yes, I heard that.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, I'll just accept it as tuition.

In fact, Sati-tan taught me a lot of peddler's tricks.

<blank>

<blank>

Okay, before we deliver the socks to God, let's see if there are any requests at the Adventurers' Guild."

<blank>

One of them is, "If you can take a delivery request or something by the way, you should take it.

<blank>

The Adventurers' Guild can demote you in rank or expel you if you don't complete a certain number of requests, so it is better to check such places from time to time. You can get some pocket money.

<blank>

In addition, I was told of a town where I could purchase the lotion requested by Sister Harumikazuchi, so I would look for requests in that direction.

<blank>

<blank>

With such enthusiasm, I walked through the door of the Adventurers' Guild.

<blank>

Karina!　I'm so glad you're safe!　I looked for you. I'm glad you're safe.

Hm?"　Braid senior. Eh, were you looking for me?　Why?"

<blank>

Braid-senpai looks relieved to see me.

What do you mean by safe?　As you can see, I'm not injured or sick, okay?

<blank>

I think some not-so-nice people saw us lumberjacks the day before yesterday."

Yeah, we used carts and made a big show of it, you know."

He said, "There was a guy who wanted to attack you because you were a solo rookie with a lot of money and a pretty girl. You're not that bad on the inside, but you're really not that bad on the outside.

<blank>

What's that thing inside? I'm going to tell your sister Harumikazuchi ...... No, I'm not.

Blade-senpai said that because he saw me at the Shunrai Pavilion, and I don't remember, I just heard it from my sister, but it's definitely a 'that's what's inside' kind of thing. ......

<blank>

Aside from that.

<blank>

If you ask me, she's a beautiful girl with money and no relatives. If she doesn't even stay at an inn, she's just like a duck walking around with leeks on her back. It's too delicious."

Hmm?"　Well, that's what I mean. And I also heard that a dark-haired woman was taken by a merchant yesterday at a commercial guild, so I was worried.

I see. Did I cause you concern?"

<blank>

The information is subtle and inaccurate, but that's okay.

<blank>

I was taken home, but it was a girl, so I'm okay with it."

Hey, that woman was okay!"

I know exactly how you feel about me when you worry about my partner instead of me. I don't care. Well, I don't remember this time again, because I was drunk.

<blank>

Satitan was chummy selling me alcohol, so there must have been an agreement to do something that wasn't okay. Probably. I'm sure. Meibi.

She looks like a loli, she's a dwarf and an adult, so she's legal!

<blank>

I'm not sure how much I can afford to spend. As for the money, as you can see, I was forced to buy alcohol.

"It's just ...... money turned into booze, so it ain't much different."

I'll take that as well. Oh, would you like to buy a bottle of Braid Senpai?"

No, no, no, no. Maybe it's just some booze you can buy around here?"

Think of it as helping a junior in need!"

Don't be silly, you could make a fortune as a lumberjack in no time."

<blank>

It is.

But hey, I'm not in an imminent money crunch right now, and I'm tired of being a lumberjack. Besides, I'm scared of the attackers and running away, and why should I give them any consideration.

<blank>

Yeah, let's crush the raiders thoroughly before we go to another town to stock up on lotions.

No, rather, let's raid them backwards.

And I've been a little bit of a help to this town, Solacidore. I'm willing to help improve public safety!　Spatial magic is bloodthirsty tonight.

<blank>

They're going to kill me, so it's okay if I kill them, right?"

That ain't fancy when you say it like that."

I'm sure I've done it by accident.　"Maybe?　If you don't go easy on them?

You said, "...... isn't that a pun? Uh, that's it. If you don't get to him first and he takes a hit, it's self-defense."

<blank>

I heard that the church has a magical tool that can detect such things. I can use it for self-defense without any worries. Hahaha.

<blank>

'If it's overdefense, you'll pay a fine. Then I'll go out with the lumberjacks."

The "Yay!　If you overdo it, the money will fix it assiduously!"

<blank>

Is that one of those things, the lives of people in other worlds, lighter.

Well, I'm a resident of that world now, too!

<blank>

If you're going to help me as a lumberjack, I don't have to worry!　Then, I'll be on my way."

I ain't worried about you losing because you're you, but just be careful not to catch anyone unawares and involve unrelated people."

Yes," he said. Hopefully tomorrow morning will be a little more secure than today."

<blank>

I will not tell anyone that my presence is most likely to disrupt public safety.
