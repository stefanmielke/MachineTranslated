# I apologize for the worry.

(I messed up the scheduled post and posted two chapters)

"Let's drink again. Next time, I won't let you take off my socks, okay?"

"Ahaha, see you again!"

"Make sure to buy some alcohol too~"

"That's a bit much for me!"

<b>

I'm Karina. I said goodbye to my dwarf friend Sati.

She’s small and cunning, and I learned a lot from her.

<b>

By the way, the commercial guild certificate allows for a certain amount of money to be exchanged between guild certificates.

The electronic payment function is amazing in this other world. Thanks to that, my balance is pretty tight.

For now, since my backpack is heavy, I'll temporarily move the contents of the bottles into a storage space. I must also remember to link the bottles and their contents accurately so I can return them properly.

<b>

The prices are reasonably fair, and it seems that if I sell everything individually at a personal transaction level, I can still make a decent profit!

However, if I want to sell everything at once, it seems I need to deal with a licensed liquor store, or else I could be punished. Got it.

<b>

<b>

Well, I’ll accept it as a lesson learned.

In fact, Sati taught me various things about being a traveling merchant.

<b>

<b>

"Alright, before I deliver the socks to the god, let's check if there are any requests at the Adventurers' Guild."

<b>

One of those is, "If you can take delivery requests on the side, you should."

<b>

At the Adventurers' Guild, if you don’t complete a certain number of requests, you can be demoted or expelled, so it seems wise to check those places regularly. It also brings in some pocket money.

<b>

Additionally, I learned about a town where I can procure the lotion that Harumikazuchi asked for, so I’ll look for requests in that direction.

<b>

<b>

With that determination, I stepped through the door of the Adventurers' Guild――

<b>

"Karina! You’re safe! I’ve been looking for you, I’m glad you’re okay."

"Huh? Blade-senpai. Wait, you were looking for me? Why?"

<b>

Blade-senpai looked relieved to see me.

What does he mean by "safe"? As you can see, I’m not injured or sick, right?

<b>

"It seems that a not-so-nice guy was watching you the other day when you were with the lumberjack."

"Ah, well, we were making quite a scene with the cart."

"There was a guy who was trying to attack you because you’re a solo newbie with a lot of money and a beautiful girl. The inside may be questionable, but you really don’t look bad on the outside."

<b>

What does he mean by "the inside is questionable"? I’ll tell Harumikazuchi… no, wait.

Blade-senpai has seen me at Shunrai-tei, so that’s why he’s saying that, and I only heard about it from my sister, so I don’t remember, but it’s definitely something that could be described as "the inside is questionable"...

<b>

Putting that aside.

<b>

"Now that you mention it, I have money, no relatives, and I’m a beautiful girl. If I’m not staying at an inn, it’s like a duck walking around with green onions on its back. Too delicious."

"Yeah? Well, that’s how it is. And I heard that yesterday a black-haired girl was taken away by a merchant at the commercial guild, so I was worried about you."

"I see. I apologize for the worry?"

<b>

The accuracy of the information is a bit off, but that’s fine.

<b>

"I was taken away, but since the other party was also a girl, I’m fine."

"Hey, was that girl okay!?"

"The fact that you’re worrying about the other person instead of me shows what you really think of me, doesn’t it? It’s fine, though. Well, I don’t remember anything from this time either, but I had been drinking."

<b>

Sati had slyly sold me alcohol, so even if something not okay happened, there should have been consent. Probably. Surely. Maybe.

I look like a loli, but I’m a dwarf and an adult, so it’s legal!

<b>

"Ah. As for the money, as you can see, I was forced to buy alcohol, so I’m completely broke."

"…It’s just that the money turned into alcohol, so it’s not much different."

"That’s true. Oh, Blade-senpai, do you want to buy a bottle?"

"No, it’s fine. You can probably buy normal alcohol around here, right?"

"Please think of it as helping a struggling junior!"

"Don’t be ridiculous, you can earn money as a lumberjack easily."

<b>

That’s true.

But right now, I’m not in urgent need of money, and I’m tired of being a lumberjack. Plus, why should I have to consider the attackers and run away?

<b>

Yeah, before I go to procure the lotion in another town, I’ll thoroughly crush the attackers.

No, rather, I’ll attack them instead.

This town, Sorashidore, has helped me a bit. I’ll cooperate with some improvement in the security! Tonight, my spatial magic is hungry for blood.

<b>

"It’s okay to kill them if I’m in danger, right?"

"If you say that, it’s not a joke."

"Sometimes it just happens, right? Maybe? If I miscalculate my restraint?"

"…It’s not a joke. Ah, well, if you don’t strike first and take a hit first, then it’s self-defense."

<b>

I’ve heard there’s a magical tool in the church that can determine such things. I can safely unleash violence in self-defense. Hahaha.

<b>

"If it’s excessive self-defense, you’ll have to pay a fine. Then I’ll accompany you as a lumberjack."

"Yay! Even if I go overboard, I can easily solve it with money!"

<b>

So that’s how it is, the lives of people in another world are light.

Well, I’m a resident of that world now too!

<b>

"If you’re going to help me as a lumberjack, I’ll feel safe! Well then, I’ll get started right away."

"I’m not worried about you losing, but just be careful not to get ambushed or involve unrelated people."

"Okay! I hope the security will be a little better by tomorrow morning than today."

<b>

I won’t tell anyone that my existence is likely to disturb the security the most.
