# What an amazing information!

(I got lots of compliments, so I'm going to try to update a little more every day...!　Thank you!)

I, Karina, am a little girl. A lost lamb!

I wandered over to the church in Solacidore on my supposed holiday, which is supposed to be on the way to Carcassa.

I bet this place will solve all my problems!

<blank>

So, here is a crash question session with Siesta, the pink succubus sister, who is hard at work as usual on her sissy duties.

<blank>

'Nein nein Siesta. The boys are getting used to seeing me as a girl, and they're not very shy. What should I do?"

Why not magically erase the memory of familiarity?"

<blank>

Can a succubus use that kind of magic?

<blank>

Well, if you're careless, you'll lose all your memories and become a cripple."

"Um, danger magic."

I'm kidding. I'm kidding."

<blank>

Siesta smiles at me. I'm so glad that we can joke around with each other.

<blank>

I want to keep embarrassing them," he said. For a pair of socks for God's sake?"

I see. In that case, I will offer some of the results of my research as a predecessor who has continued to offer socks to God in this world."

<blank>

Oh, that sounds like some great information!

<blank>

Ningen are creatures that get used to it. So, rather than having them dress like that on a regular basis, it is better to have them do it occasionally so that they feel more shame.

"...... I see. What if I'm already used to that?"

There are more embarrassing outfits in the world than nudity. My dear friends."

<blank>

What ......?

<blank>

I know it's only a cross-dressing.　Then, let them dress up in a more shameful way.

Another outfit that stirs up shame!"

<blank>

Hey, hey, hey, Dr. Siesta, you're a pussy.

<blank>

"The interval could be once a week, or even once a month ......, or even just the day before delivery to God. That way it feels more special and less familiar."

I see... ...... is instructive."

Well, if you combine that with a physically humiliating hand, it's perfect. Can I help you with that?"

Oh my God, Dear, they're going to eat you. In a sexual way, of course."

<blank>

You can't take it!　You can't take it!

<blank>

'Oh, and the other way around. You could have them dress normally."

"If you dress a man's daughter in a normal ...... outfit, i.e., a boy's outfit..."

<blank>

The words are indistinguishable by sound, but Siesta grasped the difference in nuance and affirmed it with a smile.

<blank>

The greater the gap, the greater the shame, my friends.

As for me, I usually like you to dress like a girl ...... because you're so cute."

...... You could have them dress up as boys half the week and only love them skin-to-skin when they dress up as girls."

<blank>

Hou.

Maybe ...... ants?

<blank>

But, my dear colleague," he said, "I am not a man's girl. If the goal was to turn them into male daughters in the first place, wouldn't it be just what they wanted, for them to feel no shame in wearing girl's clothes?"

What?　That's what they say, isn't it?"

'I see you were distracted by your immediate shame. For boys there is the shame of boys, and for daughters of men, the shame of daughters of men."

I knew it. ...... It's a siesta!"

<blank>

However, as it stands, he would just be a boy who is used to dressing up as a girl, so a week and a half measure should be taken.

<blank>

Whatever it is, the abrasion of shame by habituation is our worst enemy."

I'm not sure I can beat him even with the spatial magic God gave me. ......　I'll do my best!

Yes, good luck.

<blank>

But I think the siesta is kinder than at any other time.

<blank>

I have heard from God about the activities of my peers," he said. I have adopted his research.

Hm?　I mean?"

But when I dared to try a dream in which a grown man is made to walk down the street dressed as a pretty girl, it was very well received by the gods. If I had to use an analogy, I would say it was a gingerbread tempura."

<blank>

She even tried to take it off in her dreams, so they set her up with a curse that prevented her from taking it off.

Well, if a burly man or a mature woman were suddenly forced to walk the streets in gothic lolita fashion against their will, they would certainly feel a sense of shame.

<blank>

I am very grateful to your colleague for the progress you have made in the research I just mentioned. Shaming them by daring them to wear it. It is a wonderful idea. Thanks to you, I was able to eat a lot of otherworldly sweets as a reward the other day.

'Ah, so that's why you were so nice to me and in such a good mood.

Yes, I am. Let us continue to work together for the sake of God, Gozoku."

<blank>

He was an enthusiastic apostle of God, a siesta.

Well, I need to get some boys' clothes... ...... I don't remember if there were boys' clothes in the package that Kumin-san is keeping for me. I'll pay for them and write a letter asking if I can use them.
