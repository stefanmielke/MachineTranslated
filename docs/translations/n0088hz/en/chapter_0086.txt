# Some Amazing Information

(I received so many compliments, so I’ll try to update a bit more every day...! Thank you!)

I’m Karina-chan. A lost little lamb!

I’ve come to the Sorashidore Church on my day off, which is supposed to be during my move to Calcutta.

Surely, this place will help solve my worries!

<b>

So, here I am, interrupting Sister Siesta, the pink succubus, who is diligently doing her sisterly duties for a Q&A session.

<b>

“Hey, hey Siesta. The boy who dresses as a girl is getting used to it and is losing his shyness. What should I do?”

“Why not use magic to erase the memory of getting used to it?”

<b>

Can succubi really use such magic???

<b>

“Well, if you’re not careful, you might erase all memories and turn them into a shell of a person.”

“Hmmm, dangerous magic.”

“Just kidding, just kidding.”

<b>

Siesta smiles cheerfully. I’m happy that we’ve reached a point where we can joke with each other.

<b>

“I want to keep it mild, you know, to keep making him embarrassed. For the sake of the socks offered to God?”

“I see. In that case, I’ll share some of my research findings as a forerunner who has continuously offered socks to God in this world.”

<b>

Oh, this sounds like amazing information!

<b>

“Humans are creatures that get used to things. So, rather than making him wear such outfits regularly, it’s better to do it occasionally to increase the embarrassment.”

“...I see. What if he’s already gotten used to it?”

“There are outfits in this world that are more embarrassing than being naked, you know. My fellow.”

<b>

What...?

<b>

“It’s still just cross-dressing, right? Then, you should make him wear something that raises the level of embarrassment.”

“Something that raises the level of embarrassment!?”

<b>

Whoa, Siesta-sensei is amazing.

<b>

“As for the frequency, once a week, or maybe once a month... or just the day before offering to God would be fine. That way, it feels special and he won’t get used to it.”

“I see... That’s enlightening.”

“Well, if you combine it with physical humiliation, it would be perfect. Shall I help you with that?”

“Oh no, dear-kun is going to be eaten. Of course, in a sexual sense.”

<b>

Dear-kun is mine! You can’t take him!

<b>

“Oh, and also the opposite direction. It’s good to let him wear normal clothes regularly too.”

“Normal clothes... So, making the boy who dresses as a girl wear boy clothes?”

<b>

When put into words, it’s hard to distinguish by sound, but Siesta clearly understands the nuance of the difference and smiles in agreement.

<b>

“The greater the contrast, the more embarrassment increases, my fellow.”

“I personally want him to wear girl clothes most of the time... because it’s cute.”

“...It’s also an option to have him wear boy clothes half the week and only have skinship when he’s dressed as a girl.”

<b>

Hmm.

...That might be an option?

<b>

“But my fellow, if the goal was to make him a boy who dresses as a girl, then losing the sense of shame in wearing girl clothes is exactly what you aimed for, isn’t it?”

“Huh? Now that you mention it, that’s true?”

“It seems you were distracted by the immediate sense of shame. Boys have their own humiliations, and boys who dress as girls have theirs.”

“That’s true... I see it clearly now, Siesta!”

<b>

That said, as it stands, he’s just a boy who has gotten used to wearing girl clothes, so I should take measures to balance it out over the week.

<b>

“Anyway, the erosion of shame due to getting used to it is our great enemy.”

“Ugh, a formidable foe that even the space magic given by God can’t defeat...! I’ll do my best!”

“Yes, good luck to you.”

<b>

However, Siesta seems unusually kind today.

<b>

“What’s up? I’ve heard about your activities from God, and I’ve incorporated that into my research.”

“Oh? What do you mean?”

“Until now, the basic method during sock production was to humiliate through lewd dreams, but I tried a dream where ‘a grown adult is made to wear cute girl clothes and walk down the street,’ and it received great praise from God. It’s like ginger tempura, for example.”

<b>

It seems that even in dreams, they tried to take off their clothes, so they set it up with a curse that prevents them from doing so.

Hmm, indeed, if a burly man or an older woman were suddenly made to walk around in gothic lolita fashion against their will, that would definitely provoke a sense of shame.

<b>

“Hehe, the research results from earlier have progressed thanks to you, my fellow. Deliberately making them wear clothes to humiliate them. What a wonderful idea. Thanks to that, I was able to eat a lot of otherworldly sweets as a reward the other day.”

“Oh, so that’s why you were so kind and in a good mood with me.”

“Yes. Let’s continue to work hard together for God, my fellow.”

<b>

Siesta, the enthusiastic apostle of God.

Now, I need to get some boy clothes... I wonder if there were any boy clothes in the package I received from Kumin-san. I’ll write a letter asking if I can use them since I’ll pay for them.
