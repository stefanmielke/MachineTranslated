"......Haa...! I managed to win! But being the dragon priestess... ugh, I'm a guy!"

"Good job, Dear."

"I'm back! Ah, geez... already!"

<b>

Gently welcoming Dear back to the base after the award ceremony.

It seems he has been holding back a lot of embarrassment, fidgeting and twisting his body.

<b>

"Wow, that was fun!"

"That might be fine for Arthur, but I'm in this outfit, you know?"

"Hey, Dear. I heard from everyone that your skirt is actually women's clothing underneath, right?"

"......Y-yes! Ugh, it was fine during the fitting, but in actual combat, if I don't wear it properly, the safety mechanism for the opponent might not activate..."

<b>

Dear confesses with a bright red face.

That's right. Right now, Dear is dressed in full black goth-loli. And of course, that extends to his underwear too!

<b>

<b>

Actually, he doesn't have to wear women's underwear.

This was arranged by the five elders, telling me to "say that." I'm the mastermind behind this.

Regarding the costume, the socks are also regular knee-highs from the church.

<b>

Wearing women's underwear and acting tough, Dear the idol tamer has been called a priestess and a princess... surely a lot of embarrassment has built up...!

<b>

<b>

Should I tease him a little more!!!

<b>

"Hey, what kind of panties are you wearing? Show me."

"Huh!? N-no, I-I don't show my underwear to others!"

"Come on? We're close, right?"

<b>

Seeing Dear's face turn bright red, I can't help but smile widely.

I gently approach him, hugging him from the side and whispering in his ear.

<b>

"Hey, can I see? I'm curious about what kind of underwear Dear is wearing."

"......W-well, Arthur is watching too..."

"That's fine, he's a dragon, so he won't mind. ...Here? Is this where you're wearing them?"

<b>

I softly stroke Dear's belly, gently caressing his lower abdomen. I don't reach down to his groin.

The frills of the goth-loli outfit are fun to touch.

<b>

"Nhii!? W-wait, um..."

"Hm? What's wrong?"

<b>

Dear's ears are bright red, even the tips... Should I not suck on them? I'm starting to want to.

At that moment, Arthur speaks to me in a low voice, in dragon language.

<b>

『(Should I go back to my room?)』

『(Teasing. Pretend to not understand, help me)』

『(Got it!)』

<b>

I give short instructions in a low voice, using dragon language and tamer skills.

<b>

"Wow, it's great that you and Dear are so close!"

"Ah, no, um! W-well, we are close, but, um, big sister!"

"Speaking of which, I'm going to wear a goth-loli dress after this too. I want to match my underwear with Dear's."

"M-matching underwear!?"

"How about I wear what Dear is wearing right now?"

"......Ugh..."

<b>

The underwear designated by the five elders is a thong, so I can actually wear it too.

...And at this moment, while stroking Dear's waist, I untie the string of his underwear! Space magic, here we go!

<b>

---With a light sound, the fabric falls almost silently to the floor.

<b>

"Huh? ...Hyaah!?"

『Oh, something fell! Here you go.』

"Thanks for picking it up, Arthur."

<b>

Under the skirt, Arthur picks up Dear's underwear, and I receive it.

The black thong that Dear was wearing still retains his body heat and feels warm.

The fabric area is quite small. There are a few frills on the outside, and a small ribbon that looks cute.

<b>

"Wow, so this is what your underwear looks like. You were wearing this on that stage?"

"~~! D-don't look at it!!"

<b>

Dear snatches the underwear from my hand and grips it tightly.

<b>

The look in his eyes as he looks at me is tearful, his face bright red, and his nose slightly twitching.

Yet, while he seems troubled, there's a hint of happiness in his expression... Ah, yes! That's the face I wanted to see!!

<b>

"Dear, take off your socks! Right now!"

"Huh, b-but, I'm not wearing any underwear right now, so here..."

"Now! It has to be now, right now! Just take them off! Here, change into these!"

"W-wait, y-yes... Ugh. D-don't look, okay?"

<b>

Dear, somewhat confused, reluctantly accepts.

...But that adorably cute reaction is already that of a girl.

<b>

And while Arthur peeks under the skirt and I gasp, "Wha!? C-come on, Arthur!" he changes into the socks I handed him.

<b>

Of course, I collected the socks he changed into without question.

...This definitely scored a 70 points! He wore them throughout the tournament, so it might even exceed 80 points!

(Delayed, but here's Dear's part!

Recently, I've been holding back a bit due to the AI illustration situation, but this is Dear in goth-loli, right? It's a lie to say there are no illustrations...)
