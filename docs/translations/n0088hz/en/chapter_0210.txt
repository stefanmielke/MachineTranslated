# Hey, I'm going to work hard for another day!

<blank>

My name is Karina!　A beautiful girl fighter who is competing in a terra realby tournament!

Yesterday, I lightly qualified and won the first round without incident. However, there were a lot of beastmen on the other side, so I felt like getting a little fuzzy!　So I called Mr. Masilo and had him give me a lot of fluffing!　Heh heh!

I'll do my best to win again today, the second day!

<blank>

So, on the second day, I asked Mashiro-san to satisfy my growing desire for mofu-mofu (fluffy hair) by defeating beastmen.

Well, Masilo-san, who is so fluffy all over, is really ...... comfortable to hold, or rather, to be held.

To put it bluntly, it's like being wrapped up in a big dog. It smells good, like a dog that likes to bathe and is washed and polished to the point of being fluffy.

I wonder if Masilo has noticed that the brushes in the ...... changing rooms are secretly made by Godairo.

I'm sure Carina will do well for me.　I believe Carina can do it.

I'll take care of it." ...... Oh man, I'm starting to feel like I'm playing DV boyfriend-girlfriend again."

I don't know. I don't care about that."

<blank>

Hey," he said, burying his face in Masilo's fur. Not a dog sucker, but a Masilo sucker.

Soooo ...... is - the best. Love it!

<blank>

And then, a knock on the door.

<blank>

Carina, breakfast is ready, may I bring it in?"

Oh, wait a minute. Mr. Masiello."

Oops, I stayed a little too long. I'm going home before you see me. See you later.

<blank>

And after a quick kiss on my cheek, Masilo-san returned to his base. Damn you, you handsome guy. I like him!

I was well dressed and invited the staff and breakfast into my room.

<blank>

Breakfast, it was steak in the morning!　What kind of meat is this? Oh, a minotaur?　Wow, they treat the contestants well, don't they?

Well, it was a treat. It was very satisfying and tasty.

<blank>

Well, my stomach is full. Now I can challenge the second day with my body and mind in perfect condition.

<blank>

<blank>

"Dear Sir, I gathered some information last night at ......."

Oh. How'd it go, Isiah?"

Something tells me that King Barbaros had already been defeated.

<blank>

Isiah said as he turned to the side. Did I sleep wrong?

<blank>

Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to blow them away! Then all you have to do is just blow them away without any more hesitation! ...... By the way, Isiah, what's going on over there?"

'No, it's more like I can't face reality. I hope you don't mind."

I see."

<blank>

Yeah, I guess I did something wrong, didn't I?　Hey, what did I do?　Oh, you don't have to worry about it?　Are you really okay with "following your heart"?

<blank>

"...... Yes. Because there's nothing I can do about it now!!!!"

Oh, oh.

<blank>

......Kyo, I'm going to work hard for another day!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Yes. So, the first match of the second day, which the MC declared to be a third round, something I thought was a second round. Today, they are going to play one match at a time in the center ring.

<blank>

　Kalliiiiiiiiiiiiinaa shoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooinnnggg!　A supernova who easily defeated the most promising candidate for the championship, the King of Barbaros, and easily completed the 11 consecutive matches that the king was originally supposed to play!　Adventurer rank D?　The guild members are a bunch of knuckle-draggers!　She will go on to win the championship!　Can our country's fighters stop her march?

<blank>

Woohoo ！！！！！　and a grand cheer echoed through the Coliseum as I appeared.

<blank>

Yes, the MC just said it all. Yes, he did.

That's no wonder Aysia looked away and felt awkward!

<blank>

Oh, and my opponent, a nunchaku user, took the nunchaku and threw it at me. Victory!
