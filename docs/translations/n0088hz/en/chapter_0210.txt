# I-I'll do my best today too!

<b>

I'm Karina-chan! A beautiful warrior participating in the Terrarial Ruby tournament!

Yesterday, I easily passed the preliminaries and won the first round without any issues. However, since there were many beastmen as my opponents, I just wanted to cuddle! So, I called Mashiro-san and got to cuddle a lot! Hehe!

Today, on the second day, I'll do my best aiming for victory!

<b>

So, on the second day, I'm challenging the tournament again, fulfilling my heightened desire to cuddle after defeating beastmen with Mashiro-san.

Wow, Mashiro-san, who is all fluffy, really feels so… comforting to hug, or rather, to be hugged by.

To put it bluntly, it feels like being wrapped in a big dog. It has the nice scent of a dog that loves baths and has been washed, and the fluffiness is just perfect.

… I wonder if Mashiro-san has noticed that the brush in the changing room has secretly become a product of the Five Elder Lords.

<b>

"Well then, make sure to win for me, okay? I believe you can do it, Karina."

"Yeah, leave it to me. … Oh no, I'm starting to feel like we're playing house with a DV boyfriend and girlfriend again."

"I told you, I don't get it. Just stop with that."

<b>

Heh, I buried my face in Mashiro-san's fur. Not dog-sucking, but Mashiro-sucking.

Suuuu… Haa, the best. I love it!

<b>

Then, I heard a knock on the door.

<b>

"Karina-san, breakfast is ready. May I bring it in?"

"Oh, wait a moment. Mashiro-san."

"Oops, I stayed a bit too long. I'll head back before I'm seen. See you later."

<b>

After giving me a quick kiss on the cheek, Mashiro-san returned to the base. Damn, that handsome guy. I like him!

I also put on my clothes properly and invited the staff in for breakfast.

<b>

Breakfast was steak this morning! I wonder what kind of meat this is. Huh, Minotaur? Wow, the main tournament participants are treated well.

Well, thank you for the meal. It was filling and delicious.

<b>

Alright, my stomach is full. With this, I'm ready both physically and mentally to take on the second day.

<b>

<b>

"Master, I gathered some information last night…"

"Oh. How was it, Aisia?"

"Apparently, King Barbaros has already been eliminated."

<b>

Aisia said this while looking away. Did she sleep wrong?

<b>

"Oh, in that case, I can just go all out and defeat my opponents without hesitation! … By the way, Aisia, is there something over there?"

"No, it's just that I can't face reality. Please don't mind me."

"I see."

<b>

Yeah, I kind of figured out that I messed up, didn't I? Hey, what did I do? Huh, you say it's fine not to worry? "As you wish, Master," is that really okay?

<b>

"… Yes. There's nothing I can do about it now!!"

"O-Okay."

<b>

… I-I'll do my best today too!

<b>

Alright. So, I thought it was the second round, but the announcer declared it was the third round for the first match of the second day. It seems we're doing one match at a time in the central ring today.

<b>

"The dark horse of this tournament!! Karina Shoooooooneeeen!! The most promising candidate for victory, easily defeating King Barbaros, and effortlessly handling the 11 consecutive matches that were supposed to be conducted by the king!! An adventurer rank of D? The guild members must be blind!! Charging straight towards victory!! Can our warriors stop her advance!?"

<b>

Waaaaaaah!!!! With my entrance, a grand cheer echoed through the coliseum.

<b>

Yeah. The MC just said everything. Yeah, I messed up.

No wonder Aisia was looking away and feeling awkward!!

<b>

Oh, I already snatched the nunchaku from my opponent and threw it away. Victory!!
