# I have to go play

<blank>

Deere-kun brought some kind of cute girl.

Is she cheating on me?　I was prepared for a moment, but it was not the case.

<blank>

So, I heard that my hometown is under attack by dragons.

I see. Dear, you are so kind."

<blank>

All right, all right, I pat her on the head. Sacrificing ...... to a dragon is a bit exciting in a way.

<blank>

Then, let's go there!　Is this the village?

I'm not sure I've ever heard of her.

I was waiting for Dia's tournament to be over. Besides, if left alone, an unsullied girl would be sacrificed, right?"

She is indeed a big sister. I knew you would say that."

<blank>

And, although Mr. Deere praised me, it is not such an auspicious idea.

Because it's a waste. Why not give it to me instead of feeding it to the dragons?　God would be more pleased if I made him socks than feeding him to dragons.

<blank>

Well, I'm not going to bother to tell you. Something that would lower my likability.

<blank>

But, of course, it can't be for free."

"Eh, ah--"

Yes, it is. It can't be free. You should be paid well for your ability to negotiate with dragons.

"--Yes, of course. ......"

<blank>

The robed boy looked like he wanted to say something, but he shut his mouth when Dear followed me. We get a lot in return, don't we?

<blank>

I have enough money at the moment, so I'll just take what I don't need. I have enough money for now, so I'll just take a sacred object or a sock that I don't need."

What, a sock or a sock?　What, a sacred object or a sock? ...... Oh, I misheard you. Sorry."

No, you're right. Well, there are a lot of conditions."

"......?　Yes?　Yes. ......?

<blank>

Loeb is a big question mark. She's got a pretty face, too, and her tits look plainly huge, so I have high hopes for the value of her socks.

God would be pleased if we delivered the set together with the socks of the sacrificial children who have yet to be seen.

<blank>

'Yes,' he said. Maybe I should invite Misha to join us?"

...... come to think of it, when is that guy going to be living in there?"

I gave him the keys. I gave him the key."

<blank>

Misha, the owner of God's favorite butt. With her cat-and-beast-like whimsy, she won a pet slot at our base before we knew it.

While she is at the bottom of the pecking order, easily showing her belly to Arthur, her senior pet, she recognizes that Dia and Aisia are her protectors and challenges me and Masilo to a game at every opportunity. That's the kind of pet he is.

He also offers his "butt" as rent, and all the Five Elders are studying his butt. (Also, he still thinks of himself as the "Five Elders of Pachi," and he is still being played with.)

<blank>

"...... Um, well, um, well, if you can, just the miko princess and the dragon-sama, ...... it's a hidden village, so you don't want to invite too many people. ......"

What?　A hidden village?　That's more and more a place I have to go and play."

I know you like this kind of thing, don't you, sister? Me too."

I'm sure there are a lot of them.　Oh, if you want, let's go to the village of dragons next time.　I'm sure you'll be able to defeat them all and reach the top.

<blank>

Dragon's Village. That would be nice too. ...... Well, there don't seem to be any pretty girls. Arthur said that dragons in this world don't turn into people.

<blank>

"Oh, ...... but if it's only miko princesses, then I'm not allowed, am I?"

"...... ugh ...... wow, okay!　You can accompany me ......"

"That's right!　Good for you, Dear!"

Yes!"

In this case, is the attendant "Dia-kun-chan" or "Miss?　Miss?"

<blank>

Hahaha, don't say stupid things, Arthur. Words are hard!
