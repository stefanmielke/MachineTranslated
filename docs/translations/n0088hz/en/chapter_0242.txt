# We Must Go Play

<b>

Dear-kun brought a cute girl with him.

Is it cheating!? I braced myself for a moment, but it seems that's not the case.

<b>

"Anyway, it seems my hometown is being attacked by dragons."

"I see. Dear-kun is so kind."

<b>

I pat his head. The idea of a dragon demanding a sacrifice... there's something thrilling about it.

<b>

"Well then, shall we go? To that village?"

"Eh, seriously, sis?"

"I was waiting for Dear-kun's tournament to finish. Besides, if we leave it alone, an innocent girl will end up as a sacrifice, right?"

"You're such a big sister. I expected you to say that."

<b>

Dear-kun praised me, but it's not really such a noble thought.

I mean, it's a waste, isn't it? If it's between feeding a dragon or giving her to me, I'd rather have her, right? Even the gods would be happier making socks than feeding a dragon.

<b>

Well, I won't say that out loud. Something that would lower my favorability.

<b>

"But of course, it can't be for free."

"Eh, um—"

"That's right. It wouldn't be fair to do it for free. We should properly reward you for your special skill in negotiating with dragons."

"—Yes, of course..."

<b>

The robed girl looked like she wanted to say something, but she closed her mouth when Dear-kun followed my lead. We always make sure to get a good return!

<b>

"Ah, about the reward. Right now, I have enough money, so I’d be fine with a useless artifact or some socks."

"Eh, socks? Uh, artifact or socks... I must have misheard. I'm sorry."

"No, you're right. Well, there are various conditions, though."

"......?? Yes? Yes...???"

<b>

The robed girl was filled with questions. She has a cute face, and her breasts seem modestly large, so I can expect good value from the socks.

If I deliver them together with the socks of the yet-to-be-seen sacrificial girl, the gods will surely be pleased.

<b>

"By the way, should I invite Misha too?"

"......Speaking of which, that person has somehow settled down here, is that okay?"

"Well, she's a pet. I even gave her a key."

<b>

Misha, the owner of the god's favorite rear. She's a cat beastman with a carefree attitude and has somehow won the pet spot in our base.

Though she shows her belly to the senior pet Arthur, she recognizes Dear-kun and Aisia as protectors while challenging me and Mashiro-san to duels at every opportunity. That's the kind of pet she is.

Also, as rent, she offers her "rear," and all the Five Elders are currently researching it. (And they still think of her as the Five Elders of Pachinko and are being toyed with.)

<b>

"Um, well, if possible, I'd prefer it to just be the priestess and the dragon... since it's a hidden village, I’d rather not call too many people..."

"What? A hidden village? Then we definitely must go play."

"Sis likes this kind of thing, right? So do I."

"I often do, you know? Oh, how about we go to the dragon's village next time? If it's you, sis, you could overpower everyone and stand at the top."

<b>

The dragon's village. That sounds nice... although it seems there won't be any cute girls. Arthur said that dragons in this world don't transform into humans.

<b>

"Ah... but if it's just the priestess, then I can't go, right?"

"......Ugh... I-I understand! It's fine if your attendants come along too..."

"See! That's great, Dear-kun!"

"Yes!"

"In this case, are the attendants Dear-kun and me?"

<b>

Hahaha, let's not say unnecessary things, Arthur. Words are tricky, aren't they?
