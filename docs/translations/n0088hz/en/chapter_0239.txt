# It might be bad for children's education, but!!

"Wow, the dwarven connections are amazing! I can't believe there's this much fire liquor!"

"Come on, drink up!"

"Oops, thank you, Mii-chan! My name is similar to Misha's! I feel a sense of closeness!"

<b>

As promised beforehand, I treated Misha to dwarven liquor.

<b>

"…Hey, that guy is making the queen serve drinks…"

"Well, spoilers will come later, so it's fine."

"I can only say that my sisters have good taste in that regard."

<b>

At least it seems to be a rule of mine to drink together once before any spoilers. It's not absolute, though. Dia-kun can't drink alcohol, after all.

You can tell someone's true nature by drinking, huh? But isn't it easy to gauge the Five Elders without that? I’ll keep that to myself since it's a hobby of the ladies!

<b>

"Well, Mashiro-san was also being served drinks by Mii-chan, right?"

"Now that you mention it…"

<b>

Mashiro-san looks awkward as he recalls that moment.

<b>

"Here you go, snacks!"

"Nyaa, is this heaven? To have both liquor and snacks… Aishia-chan, will you be my wife?"

"I have already devoted my body, heart, and soul to my master."

<b>

By the way, today’s welcome party for Misha is being fully covered by Mii-chan and the others, so feel free to drink as much as you like. I’ll also copy without hesitation, so enjoy your food and drink.

However, the smell of fire liquor is quite strong. Just the scent might get me tipsy.

<b>

"Hey, hey, can you show me your butt to please the gods?"

"Mu, I guess I have no choice. Just a little, okay? …Here it is!"

<b>

Mii-chan asked for it, and Misha playfully exposed her bare bottom.

<b>

"Oh, this is the butt that pleases the gods…!"

"Indeed, it has a nice shape. The meat is well-proportioned…"

"It feels nice to touch."

"I want to replicate this butt. I want to use it as a pillow."

"The inside of the hole… well, let's get to know each other better first! Hehehe."

<b>

The five of us began to pat Misha's butt. Can we really replicate that butt…!?

This seems like it could turn into a major project.

<b>

……

<b>

What would happen if I copied the entire butt?

Well, if it’s for delivering to the gods, that would be a no-go, but if I copied Misha's butt, I might have the chance to touch it anytime…?

<b>

But if I could copy not just the butt but the whole person…

<b>

…Could it work!? A copied human!? What would happen to the soul…?

……

<b>

While I was pondering whether to create a copy of Misha, Dia-kun came in after his bath. His cheeks were slightly flushed. His silver hair, usually in a ponytail, was down and he was drying it with a towel. He wore a simple dress.

He looks even cuter after a bath… I can smell a nice scent, sniff sniff.

<b>

"Oh, you called for Misha-san."

"Yeah. Oh, Mashiro-san, the bath is free now!"

"Oh, then I'll go in. Misha, do you want to join?"

"I'll pass, I don't want to sober up, hic."

<b>

Misha, waving her cup, noticed Dia-kun.

<b>

"Dia-chan! Come over here!"

"Huh? Yes… whoa!?"

"Alright, good girl! You did well, Dia-chan. You're amazing for putting in all your effort for that Karina!"

<b>

Suddenly, she hugged him and started to pet him. Hey, switch places! Dia-kun is mine!! Only I can bury Dia-kun in my chest!!

<b>

"You did great, good girl!"

"Mugh, phew, M-Misha-san, it's… hard to breathe…"

"Misha, Dia-kun is going to suffocate!"

"Oh, sorry about that."

<b>

She pulled him away from her chest and hugged him to her. Alright, come over here.

<b>

"Seriously, are you trying to dirty Dia-kun with Misha after his bath?"

"~~"

"Hey Karina, Dia-chan looks like he’s about to suffocate, let him go!"

"Just five more seconds! I’ll make sure he can breathe properly!"

<b>

I released Dia-kun from my chest. Wow, he’s bright red and cute. There’s a different kind of embarrassment now compared to just after the bath or almost suffocating.

<b>

"…My breasts are better than Misha's, right!?"

"Th-that kind of thing, um, no comment."

"What’s that? A challenge? I’ll accept! Behold these beautiful breasts that don’t need a bra!!"

"Wait, don’t take them off!?"

"Hey! It might be bad for children's education, but!!"

"Ow!?"

"Ouch! Mashiro-san, why are you hitting me too!?"

<b>

I and Misha were being hit repeatedly.

<b>

"Karina, are you getting drunk just from the smell of firewater? Come on, let's get in the bath to sober up. Misha, you too. If you want to strip, do it in the bath."

"Ehh? But I want to mark Dia-kun a bit more…"

"Fine, nya… Seriously, Mashiro’s always been the serious type."

"Oh, I want to hear more about that! Tell me stories about Mashiro-san in the old days, Misha."

"Ehh? Well, I guess I can… just a little, nya."

<b>

And so, we were dragged off to the bath by Mashiro-san.

The bath scene is cut!

<b>

"Whoa!!! This bath is huuuge, nyaaa!!!"

"…Hey, Misha! Wash yourself before you get in!! I'll smack your butt!! …By the way, I pay rent for using this bath and room, but what about Misha?"

"I’m thinking of letting her stay for free while she's in Terral Ruby. But if she wants a room built, she’ll have to pay something."

"Yeah, that sounds fair… Hey, Misha! No diving! I'll smack your butt!!"

<b>

…Cut to black!!
