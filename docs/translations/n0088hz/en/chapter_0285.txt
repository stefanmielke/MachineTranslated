# Maid Homunculus (2)

<blank>

Tch. Misha!　Show the maid what you got!"

Oh, you're in charge!　Leave it to me!"

<blank>

Misha, without any hesitation, punches the maid. However, the maid gently put her hand on Misha's fist, and Misha spun around and fell down.

<blank>

Bunyooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

Misha falls down on the bed with a thud!　Misha falls down on the bed with a mighty thud.

<blank>

Is this guy an aiki user?

No, sir. No, just that you also use the Chao-ryu school of aiki, Sir."

<blank>

That said, a maid homunculus doing curtesy in a maid's uniform.

...... has been opening a pit at my feet for a while now, but I can't fall in!

This guy's floating!　What's going on?

<blank>

As a maid, you must be able to work on unstable footholds. Therefore, these shoes are special. It is a divine weapon, the "sky joke. It's a scaffold weapon that runs like a joke in the sky.

I'd like to share with you the divine ......!　That's a very nice explanation, thank you. ...... Tei!

<blank>

This time, the magic is dropped from the ceiling in the opposite direction, as if it were a net. But, like a metastasis, it moved in an instant and was avoided. Only the bed and Misha entered the storage.

<blank>

That's another effect of the shoes!"

'No, this is the effect of this maid's uniform--the Divine Apparatus "Poet Mother etc.". It's a sacred weapon designed to go join a well meeting immediately at any time. It allows for super speed."

<blank>

The maid homunculus says so and moves behind me. I released Misha from storage and bumped him. Misha collapsed on the floor.

<blank>

Unyah, you're being handled badly, Karina!"

They have more than one sacred object, so be on your guard, Misha!"

"Divine artifacts!　Seriously, ......, is there anything we can do to counter it with a sacred weapon?

<blank>

I don't know if it is really a sacred object or not. However, there is no doubt that there is something that has the same performance as a sacred object.

<blank>

Activate--stop.

Ugh!"

<blank>

As if the air around me was solidified by spatial magic, my movement was stopped. I used spatial magic to transfer a short distance and escaped from the restraints.

<blank>

The "Oh, well, I didn't know that this maid catsuit's divine weapon, the "Head Demon Inclusion," which stops and drops any mosquito or vampire, doesn't work. It seems our guest is the real deal. Then, next, it is the turn of this cufflink, the divine weapon 'Reaction Maru'. Ei-ei-ei."

<blank>

A pebble pangs from the cufflinks on my wrist!　Pebbles explode from the cufflinks on my wrist!　They fly from the cufflinks on my wrists with a resounding "Pang! Like bullets, if you are not careful for even a moment, you will be shot out of your hand.

<blank>

What the hell is going on here?　That's one hell of an armed maid, what the hell is going on!"

108 sacred weapons adorn my body. Which of the 108 sacred weapons will you use to defeat me?"

108?　Don't tell me a bunch of lies!

"If that's what you think, then you should just shut your eyes to the facts and think that's what you want to think."

<blank>

But when I try to remove the maid's uniform or catsuit with spatial magic, it is played. This is the same reaction as if they were truly divine.

Don't tell me that the maid is really right and that all the equipment in her body is divine?

<blank>

"...... Ray, look at me!"

'Yes master. ...... oh dear."

<blank>

Kaoru attracts the attention of the maid homunculus. In her hand was a brown potion with the lid open.
