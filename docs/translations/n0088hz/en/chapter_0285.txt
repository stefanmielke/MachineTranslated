# Maid Homunculus (2)

<b>

“Chh. Misha! Show the maid what you can do!”

“Okay! Leave it to me!”

<b>

Without any hesitation, Misha lunges at the maid. However, the maid gently places her hand on Misha's fist, causing Misha to spin and fall over in a vertical roll.

<b>

“Bunyaaaaa!?”

<b>

Misha crashes onto the bed with a thud!

<b>

“This one, is she a master of Aikido!?”

“No, it’s just that her style is the Chaos Style—she simply uses Aikido, that’s all, dear customer.”

<b>

The maid homunculus says this while performing a curtsy in her maid outfit.

…By the way, she has been opening a pitfall at my feet since earlier, but I’m not falling!

She’s floating, isn’t she!? What’s going on!?

<b>

“As a maid, one must be able to work even on unstable ground. Therefore, these shoes are special. They are the divine tool ‘Kū Jōdan.’ A divine tool for traversing the sky like a joke.”

“Divine tool…! Thanks for the detailed explanation… hey!”

<b>

This time, she drops a net-like spatial magic from the ceiling. However, she dodges it in an instant, as if teleporting. Only the bed and Misha ended up in the storage.

<b>

“Is that also the effect of the shoes!?”

“No, this is the effect of this maid outfit—the divine tool ‘Shimotō.’ It was created to allow immediate participation in gossip sessions. It enables super speed.”

<b>

The maid homunculus says this and moves behind me. I release Misha from the storage and throw her. …She dodges, and Misha falls flat on the floor.

<b>

“Ugh, your handling is terrible, Karina!”

“That one has multiple divine tools, don’t let your guard down, Misha!”

“Divine tool!? Seriously… do we have anything to counter that with a divine tool!?”

<b>

The maid’s words invoke the Chaos God, but it’s unclear whether it’s really a divine tool. However, there’s no doubt that there’s something with divine tool-level performance.

<b>

“Activate—stop!”

“Ugh!?”

<b>

It feels as if the surrounding air has solidified with spatial magic, halting my movements. I used spatial magic to teleport a short distance and escaped the restraint.

<b>

“Oh my, to think that even the ‘Demon Lord’s Package’ divine tool of this maid headband cannot stop you. You seem to be the real deal, dear customer. Now, it’s time for this cufflink, the divine tool ‘Rebound Maru.’ Here we go!”

<b>

From the cufflink on her wrist, small stones go pop! pop! and explode towards me. They come flying like bullets, and if I let my guard down for even a moment, I would be shot through.

<b>

“Guh, this is one outrageous armed maid, what’s going on here!”

“I adorn myself with 108 divine tools. Now, which divine tool do you think you can defeat me with?”

“108!? Don’t just spout nonsense!”

“If you think so, then it’s fine to close your eyes to the truth and believe that.”

<b>

However, when I try to use spatial magic to strip her maid outfit or headband, I get repelled. This is the same reaction as if it were truly a divine tool.

Could it be that, as the maid says, all of her equipment is indeed a divine tool?

<b>

“...Ray, look over here!”

“Yes, Master. …Oh my, oh my.”

<b>

Kaoru draws the maid homunculus's attention. In her hand, she holds a brown potion with the lid open.
