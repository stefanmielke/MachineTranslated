# Dear-kun VS Misha

By the way, there is a rule that once you take off your clothes, you can't put them back on.

However, this is an unofficial rule that is more of a formality, and it's perfectly fine to wear them again.

In fact, the act of undressing is enticing, so it was more about saying to put them back on if you take off too much.

<b>

"Wow, this tournament is really lax. Isn't it just a free-for-all?"

"Karina, did you think this was a serious tournament?"

"That's true, I was just messing around from the start."

<b>

What exists is the erotic desire to see women undress. That was the kind of tournament it was.

And so, the next battle is finally between Dear-kun and Misha.

<b>

<b>

"……I'll protect you, Miss!"

"Haha! That's the spirit, Yoshi! I'll make you undress completely!"

<b>

Misha taunted with her microphone performance. The first round of rock-paper-scissors began immediately. This battle—it's delicious no matter who undresses. Is this for my benefit?

<b>

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!!"

<b>

Dear-kun chose rock, Misha chose paper. And Misha, with her open hand, grabbed the stick and—smack!—hit the helmet. Dear-kun's defense was just in time.

<b>

"……Not bad, Dear-chan!"

"That was close…!"

<b>

This was the first serious rock-paper-scissors match since the tournament began. Well, considering that all the other participants were pretty laid-back, and even the strong ones wanted to undress, there hadn't been any intense battles.

<b>

"Rock, paper, scissors, shoot! Take that!"

"Ugh!"

<b>

Once again, Misha won at rock-paper-scissors. Dear-kun was on the defensive. Then, with a thud! the stick slipped into the helmet and landed on Dear-kun's head.

<b>

"Ha, now undress!"

"……Yes…"

<b>

Dear-kun was faithfully following the rules, and the ring that had been removed in the previous match was no longer on his arm. Now, where would he undress? Maybe the headdress—

<b>

Just as I was thinking that, Dear-kun lifted his skirt slightly and put his hand inside.

<b>

"「「「What!？」」」"

<b>

The audience's attention was drawn to Dear-kun's hand moving awkwardly inside the skirt. And then Dear-kun—slipped off the garter ring and tossed it onto the floor.

<b>

"……That was close! I thought you suddenly took off your pants!?"

"No, um, the ring you gave me, I couldn't fit it on my arm… so I put it on my leg too."

"I was getting really excited… I don't remember how many I gave you… If you're going to surrender, do it quickly!"

"……I'll win!"

<b>

Dear-kun glared at Misha with determination, not yet giving up. So cute. I like him.

<b>

"「Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!!」"

<b>

At that moment, Dear-kun won the rock-paper-scissors. And with a smack! Misha's head was hit immediately.

<b>

"Alright!"

"W-wow, to land a hit on me… not bad, Dear-chan!"

<b>

Misha removed the cloth ring from her arm. She still had plenty of HP left.

Then she whispered something.

<b>

"……I have to let you undress a little, or else I won't have any face left. Yeah."

<b>

—It seemed Dear-kun didn't hear her, but I caught it perfectly with magic.

Misha, you're actually a good person, aren't you!!

<b>

Moreover, she was hitting him with quite a bit of restraint so that Dear-kun wouldn't feel pain. I'm really sorry about that tournament; it was all that god's fault.

<b>

<b>

And while Dear-kun was chipping away at Misha's HP, he lost three times as much, getting hit and removing garter rings.

<b>

"Take that!"

"Ouch! …Hmm, did I get hit again…"

<b>

Dear-kun thrust his hand back into his skirt again. The audience was a bit nervous but seemed to be getting used to it.

<b>

"……"

<b>

At this point, Dear-kun's hand stopped. His cheeks turned slightly red.

<b>

"……N-no, but…"

"What’s wrong?"

"N-nothing at all!"

<b>

Then Dear-kun suddenly undressed. But it wasn't the garter ring. That white cloth with decorations had two holes for legs. He lifted his legs twice to take off the cloth and tossed it onto the floor.

<b>

"……!! Oh!!"

"That's the elf's… panties!"

"This is going to extend my lifespan… thank you, thank you!"

<b>

Yes, he finally took them off. His panties! Dear-kun did! Which means right now Dear-kun is—NOT WEARING ANYTHING!!

<b>

His elf ears turned red.

The audience was greatly excited by this. What kind of tournament gets this hyped over just one piece of cloth? It's just the difference in the number of garter rings and holes, right? But I totally get it…!

<b>

"Dear, Dear-chan… did you really take off your panties!? No panties!? You should have taken off the frills on your head first, why didn't you!?"

"This equipment is a set, so…"

"Is it for fashion!? Y-you're really something…!"

<b>

No. It's because the set equipment has effects on the headdress. If you remove something, you won't know where the impact will be. Especially if the speed increase effect disappears, Dear-kun wouldn't be able to win against Misha with just his base power.

<b>

That's why he bravely took off his panties…!

<b>

Dear-kun… I'll pick up your bones, no, your socks…!

<b>

"I'll continue!"

"Y-yeah."

<b>

Dear-kun, who was fidgeting a bit with his legs together, lost to Misha twice in a row, but then he was undressed normally. However, once he removed the headdress, his speed dropped significantly, and Dear-kun could no longer win.

<b>

One by one, Dear-kun was undressed. The dress was treated as a single piece, and as he became much less dressed, the sound of gulping saliva echoed throughout the venue.

<b>

"Y-you should surrender! If you take off more than that… your butt will be completely visible!"

"……Ugh. I surrender…"

<b>

Carefully, one by one, the dress was removed, and finally, after being left in a sheer petticoat and a revealing top, Dear-kun finally surrendered.

<b>

Dear-kun, you did well… I'll take revenge for you.

Damn you, thank you, Misha!! It was a good fight!!!
