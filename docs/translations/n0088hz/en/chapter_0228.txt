# Deere vs. Misha

By the way, the rule is that once you take off your clothes, you are not allowed to put them back on.

but it is a well-known and unspoken rule, and you can wear it separately.

I was rather intrigued by the fact that he was taking off his clothes, so I told him to put them on if he took off too much.

<blank>

I thought, "This tournament is so loose. You can cheat all you want, right?"

Karina, did you really think this was such a serious competition?"

'That's true, too, and I've been fooling around with it from the start.'

<blank>

What there was was the erotic desire to see women undress. That's the kind of convention I was at.

And so, the next battle is finally between Mr. Dear and Misha.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... I'll protect your sister!"

Hahaha!　That's the spirit, Yoshi!　I'm gonna get you off like a bitch!"

<blank>

Misha stirring up the crowd with his microphone performance. The first rock-paper-scissors fight began immediately. This battle - it's delicious no matter who takes off. Is it for my benefit?

<blank>

"Slap it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-paper!"

<blank>

Deer goes "goo" and Misha goes "par". And Misha grabbed the stick with his open hand and -- snap!　And then Misha grabbed the stick with his open hand and smacked his helmet. Dia-kun's defense came just in time.

<blank>

I'm going to go to ...... and see if I can do it!　Dia-chan!"

I was just in time. ......!"

<blank>

This was the first time since the beginning of this tournament that the two rock-paper-scissors gachis were fighting each other. Well, well, there was almost no fight that fierce because all the other participants were loose, strong but wanted to take off their clothes, and were ordinary ordinary women at best.

<blank>

Jankenpon!　Kuraketeya!"

Crap!"

<blank>

Misha wins again in rock-paper-scissors. Dia is on the defensive. Then, with a pop, a stick broke through the helmet and landed on Dia's head!　and a stick interrupted his helmet and landed on Deer-kun's head.

<blank>

"Hmph, come on, take it off."

Yes, ...... yes, ......."

<blank>

Mr. Deere is a disciplined rule follower, and there are no more rings left on the arms that were taken off in the previous match. Now, where will he take it off? I wonder if it's the headdress--

<blank>

I was thinking, "I'm sorry," when Dear-kun lifted her skirt a little and put her hand inside.

<blank>

""!""

<blank>

The audience's attention is drawn to the hand fidgeting in her skirt in embarrassment. Then Dear - you slipped off the garter ring and took it off on the floor.

<blank>

I thought you were going to take your pants off!　I thought you suddenly took your pants off, nya!"

I couldn't wear the ring you gave me on my arm, so I'm wearing it on my ...... leg."

"I'm getting so nervous ...... I can't remember how many I gave you ...... if you're going to surrender, do it early!"

...... and I'm going to win!"

<blank>

Dear glares at Misha crisply with eyes that haven't given up yet. He's cute. I like it.

<blank>

"Rock, paper, scissors!"

<blank>

And here, Dear won the rock-paper-scissors game. And then, spam!　and immediately Misha's head was smacked.

<blank>

Yes!"

"Oh, wow, you've got a shot at me, ......, don't you, Dia!"

<blank>

Misha removes the cloth ring from his arm. She still has a lot of HP left.

Then he says something in a whisper.

<blank>

......I've got to let him take off some of his clothes, otherwise he won't look good. Yeah."

<blank>

--I don't think Mr. Deere could hear me, but I heard him perfectly through the magic.

Misha you ...... are a good guy after all!

<blank>

And I was hitting him pretty hard so that he wouldn't get hurt. I'm really sorry about that tournament, it was all God's fault.

<blank>

<blank>

And while Mr. Dear was cutting Misha's HP, he lost three times as much, got beat up, and took off his garter ring.

<blank>

Oh yeah!

I was like, "Oh, no, I got hit again! ......Mmmm, you got me again. ......"

<blank>

And then Dia puts her hand up her skirt again. The audience was a little nervous, but they were getting used to it.

<blank>

"......"

<blank>

And here Dia's hand stops. His cheeks turn a little red.

<blank>

"......, no, but ......"

"Hmm?　What's up, Meow?"

It's nothing!

<blank>

And, Dia-kun, you take off your clothes!　and take it off. But it was not a garter ring. It was a pure white cloth with decorations and two holes to put your legs through. He lifted his legs twice, took off the cloth, and then quickly took it off on the floor.

<blank>

"......!　Oh!!!"

That's the elf's ...... panties!"

'This is going to extend my life ...... thank you thank you thank you.'

<blank>

Yes, I finally took them off. Pants!　Deere-kun!　I mean, now Dear-kun is--not wearing them: ！！！！

<blank>

Elf ears are reddening.

The audience was very excited by this. What kind of a competition can be so exciting with just a piece of cloth? It's just a garter ring and a different number of holes, right?　But I understand it well. ......

<blank>

Di, Deere-chan ...... Don't tell me you took off your pants, Meow!　No pants!　Why didn't you take off your head first?

"This equipment, because it's a set, ......"

I'm not sure if it's for the sake of fashion!　You're doing it! ......!"

<blank>

Nope. It's because it's a set of equipment and it affects headdresses and stuff like that. I'm not sure where it would be affected if it was removed. Especially if the effect of the increase in speed is removed, Dia's bare strength will no longer be enough to beat Misha.

<blank>

For that, you can find the preparedness undressing pants at ......!

<blank>

Deere, you ...... bones, no, I'll pick up your socks. ......

<blank>

Ugh, I'll keep going!

Oh, oh.

<blank>

Misha was defeated twice in a row by Dia-kun, who was slightly squirming on her inner thighs, but Dia-kun was usually taken off after that. However, when she took off her headdress, her speed dropped dramatically, and Dia-kun was no longer able to win.

<blank>

One by one, Dear-kun was undressed. The dress was handled in one piece, and when it became thin at once, there was a sound of gulping and swallowing of raw saliva in the hall.

<blank>

I'm not going to take off any more of my clothes!　If you take off any more of your clothes, I'm going to ...... see your whole ass!

"...... ugh. I give up. ......"

<blank>

After being carefully stripped of her dress one by one, and then reduced to the barest form of two scantily clad panniers and upper-body underwear, Dear finally surrendered.

<blank>

Deere, you did your best. ...... I will avenge this.

Thanks Misha!　Good fight!
