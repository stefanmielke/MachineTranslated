# After-action report to God Part 2

<blank>

I'm sure Karina will come to you from her socks even if you leave her alone!　She must have been born under such a star!"

"It's the body God made, isn't it?"

<blank>

Maybe that sock-smelling planet must be under the jurisdiction of this god too.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh. I'll order that while I'm at it. I'll order that, too.

What's the thing?"

Yes, I have a new item called the Divine Artifact. There's an item in this world called a sacred artifact."

<blank>

Divine item. An item that serves as a stepping stone to the divine. Or, an item that exhibits god-like power.

They come in a variety of forms: some are worshipped in the form of chalices, holy swords, or holy armor, while others take the form of everyday items such as bedding or pillows. In some cases, they are found among natural objects such as rocks and trees.

<blank>

The effect is so powerful that it changes the environment.

They can enrich the earth, create oases in the desert with large amounts of water, become a god by collecting seven items from the series, grant absolute defensive strength to castle walls, and obliterate tens of thousands of enemies with a single blow.

<blank>

I see. So, what do you want me to do with that sacred object?"

We were too generous a little while ago, so please collect it when you find it. The world's energy deficit is at a pace where it will run out in 10 years if we don't do something about it.

"...... What?　Does that mean this world is going to die?"

I agree. If we do nothing and leave them alone, they will perish."

<blank>

Oh, man, this is a big deal. He's the kind of guy who can't afford to be so lighthearted about things like deficits.

<blank>

I'm adding energy to it before it perishes, so it won't perish unless I abandon it."

Oh, I see. Good."

But we can't afford to operate at a loss. If there are too many losses, I might be tempted to abandon them.

<blank>

Hmmm, this God is so self-centered to no end.

It's very God-like.

<blank>

<blank>

So I'll give you 1,000 SP per sacred object!　How about it?"

<blank>

One sacred object is equivalent to 10 pairs of Satitan's socks.

Aren't you setting the price wrong?　It's a God-class item that determines the fate of the world.

<blank>

Satitan's socks are worth it!"

I guess it's the socks that have the pricing bug."

<blank>

Socks seem to be a more efficient way to earn SP.

However, we cannot afford not to retrieve the Divine Artifact. If God were to abandon the world on a whim, the world would be destroyed in just ten years.

<blank>

I'll try to collect as much as I can. I'll try to collect as much as I can, except for the ones who seem to be using it for peaceful purposes."

I look forward to working with you!"

<blank>

Let's exclude cases like building an oasis in the desert.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh. Oh, yes, God. Do you want to talk about how I chastised those thugs?"

I said, "Yes, please do. Well, I watched."

<blank>

You saw it.

<blank>

Because you quoted me."

"...... sure?"

If they called you, you'd be curious to see them, wouldn't you?"

"...... sure."

<blank>

I feel like I threatened those punks by asking them if they believe in God, or if God is angry with them, or something like that.

<blank>

Besides, once you detect a certain level of excitement, you're curious to take a peek, aren't you?"

Excited."

I thought, "Yes, I'm doing something fun. I want to see the fun scenes, don't you?　Karina's body is great for viewing, and she's a beautiful girl just like me. It's important to have an appearance that is easy to get emotionally involved with!

<blank>

I wonder if the state of excitement was also key.

In simple terms, it's a live feed notification of the distributor.

<blank>

...... I knew I was right to get Mr. Cossioli.

<blank>

I really enjoyed this thug extermination!"

That was the best thing that could have happened."

Forced skydiving looked like a lot of fun."

I was guarding the vital point. I was guarding my vital organs, so I was sure of my life.

I think I could have killed her, but Karina has a good heart. I love her."

<blank>

God smiles and pats my head.

When you say that you could have killed the ant as if you were talking about its life or death, you are casually reminding us that you are a higher being even if you look like a girl.

<blank>

'From God's point of view, do you feel like you don't care about human life or anything else?'

I don't really care about anything except the ningen I'm looking at. It's not that I need the faith of this world. I own several other worlds.

<blank>

Can the world be owned like that 'I have several computers'!

<blank>

As for this world, he treats it completely as a hobby.

When a fool springs up in such a hobby world to cheat on his girlfriend's name, you want to twist and turn him.

<blank>

It's funny that you mention me in the "Culmination of the Evil One" because that's kind of what it looks like. You can use my name freely in the future!　Like, "Hikaeworoo," or something like that!"

I'm sorry, but are you sure you want to go to ......?　Or rather, does the Raikou-sama of Mito know about it?"

Because He is God!"

<blank>

It's God, isn't it?

<blank>

When I'm in a situation that looks rather interesting, you can quote me as if to say, "Look at me!" and quote me like that. I'll watch. In fact, if you don't call me, I'll sulk."

<blank>

They say that I, as God's apostle, can make it look good by quoting God, making it a simplified ritual.

Specifically, the upper resolution limit of the video would be increased.

<blank>

I'm happy to do plays or festivals if you want. I won't be offended if it's boring. God, I even like to deliver chats, don't you?

...... God is hilarious?"

I have a lot of time on my hands. There is plenty of time for space-time deities. Oh, you can't see him when he's deployed, so please be careful about that. No dark delivery, please.

I understand. Well, I'll call you when I get a chance."

I'll issue you a ticket for a bonus on your SP assessment if it's interesting!　If it's fun, I'll issue you a ticket for a bonus on your SP assessment!"

<blank>

Oh, thanks for the bonus ticket.

If there are fewer socks to deliver, there is less hassle.

<blank>

'Well, I hope you continue to please me. Salad bar, noshi."

Oh, yes."

<blank>

A salad bar, you say. That's not a greeting anymore, is it God?

<blank>

<blank>

~~ Special Corner: World Management Strategies of Space-Time God, a major commentary!　~~~

<blank>

Let's copy the world that worked!

You could theoretically make an infinite amount of money if you made an infinite number of copies of the world that could recover more energy than you initially invested!

There is a slight discrepancy in the random numbers due to the placement of the world, but it is a minor difference like the color of the socks, so leave it alone!　Butterfly effect?　I've never heard of it.

<blank>

Also, if you're developing new ones, it's easier if you divert organisms from another world!

The trick is to have the right environment, such as elements and air composition, on the planet where the main development will take place!

Otherwise, the moment you divert, you could die because you can't breathe. Seriously. That was a rush.

<blank>

God says, "And this is how parallel worlds and other worlds with people are created. See, it's easy, isn't it?"

Karina: "Wow, I'm learning a lot!　Except for the fact that it's impossible to copy!
