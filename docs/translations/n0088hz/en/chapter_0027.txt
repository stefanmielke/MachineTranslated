# Report to God After the Fact Part 2

<b>

"Well, if it's Karina-chan, she'll come to you from the socks without you even having to worry about it! She must have been born under such a star!"

"Isn't it the body that God made???"

<b>

That stinky sock star is probably under this God's jurisdiction as well.

<b>

<b>

"Oh. By the way, should I ask for that too?"

"What do you mean by that?"

"Yes, there are items called divine artifacts in this world."

<b>

Divine artifacts. Items that serve as stepping stones to becoming a god. Or items that exhibit god-like powers.

They come in various forms; for example, there are things that are enshrined in the form of a holy grail, holy sword, or holy armor, as well as everyday items like futons and pillows. It seems that some are even hidden among natural objects like rocks and trees.

<b>

Their effects are so powerful that they can change the environment.

They can enrich the land, create oases in deserts with large amounts of water, allow one to become a god by collecting seven series items, grant absolute defensive power to walls, or wipe out tens of thousands of enemies in a single blow.

<b>

"I see. So what do you want me to do with these divine artifacts?"

"I was a bit too generous in scattering them around not long ago, so please collect them if you find any. Currently, the world's energy is in the red, and if left unattended, it will run out in ten years."

"...Huh? Does that mean this world will perish?"

"That's right. If you leave it alone, it will perish."

<b>

Oh no, this is a big deal. This isn't something that can be described lightly as being in the red.

<b>

"Before it perishes, I'm adding energy, so as long as I don't abandon it, it won't perish."

"Oh, is that so? That's good to hear."

"But being in the red is not acceptable. If there are too many deficits, I might feel like abandoning it myself."

<b>

Hmm, this god is incredibly self-centered.

It's quite god-like, but still.

<b>

<b>

"So, I'll give you 1000 SP for each divine artifact! How does that sound?"

<b>

One divine artifact is worth ten pairs of Sati-chan's socks.

Isn't the pricing a bit off? It's a god-level item that determines the fate of the world.

<b>

"Sati-chan's socks are worth that much!!"

"I guess it was the socks that had the pricing bug."

<b>

It seems more efficient to earn SP from socks.

However, I can't just ignore the divine artifacts. If the god whimsically abandons the world, it could perish in just ten years.

<b>

"I understand. I'll try to collect as many as possible, excluding those who are using them for peaceful purposes."

"Thank you very much!"

<b>

Let's exclude cases like creating oases in deserts.

<b>

<b>

"Oh. By the way, God, should I tell you about the story of punishing the thugs?"

"Yes, please do. Well, I was watching, though."

<b>

You were watching, huh.

<b>

"Because you mentioned me, right?"

"......That's true?"

"If called, wouldn't you be curious and go see?"

"......That's true."

<b>

I feel like I threatened the thugs by saying things like whether to believe in the god or that the god is angry.

<b>

"And if I detect a certain level of excitement, I can't help but peek, right?"

"Excitement?"

"Yes, wondering if something fun is happening. I want to see the enjoyable scenes too, right? For viewing purposes, Karina-chan's body is the best; she's a beautiful girl who looks just like me. After all, an appearance that makes it easy to empathize is important!"

<b>

So excitement was a key factor too.

To put it simply, it's like a notification for a live stream from a streamer.

<b>

...I really did make the right choice in getting the Sneaky Boy.

<b>

"I really enjoyed this thug extermination!"

"That's great to hear."

"The forced skydiving looked like a lot of fun."

"Yes. Oh, I made sure to guard only the vital spots, so I guaranteed their lives, at least."

"I think it would have been fine to kill them, but Karina-chan is kind-hearted. Good girl, good girl."

<b>

The god smiled and patted my head.

The way she casually says it would have been fine to kill them, as if discussing the life and death of ants, subtly reminds me that even with a girl’s appearance, she is a higher being.

<b>

"Does that mean you don't care about human lives, God?"

"Well, I don't really care about humans that I don't have my eye on. I don't particularly need the faith of this world either. I own several other worlds as well."

<b>

Can you really own worlds like having multiple computers!?

<b>

It seems this world is treated as a mere hobby.

If a fool were to use the name of my lover in such a hobby world, I would want to crush them.

<b>

"It's perfectly fine to use my name when punishing evildoers; it makes it sound more convincing and is interesting. You can freely use my name in the future! Like, 'Behold!' or something!"

"......Is that really okay? By the way, do you know the old lord of Mito?"

"Because I'm a god!"

<b>

She is a god after all.

<b>

"Rather, in interesting situations, please bring me up with something like 'Behold!' I will watch. If you don't call me, I might sulk."

<b>

By bringing up the god, who is my apostle, it seems to establish a simple ritual and make things look better.

Specifically, it raises the resolution limit of the visuals.

<b>

"If you want, feel free to call me for plays or festivals. I won't get angry even if it's boring. I like chatting streams too, you know?"

"......Are you bored, God?"

"I'm bored. As a time-space god, I have all the time in the world. Oh, just be careful when I'm using Sneaky Boy; I can't see then. No dark streams, please."

"I understand. Well, if I get the chance, I'll call you."

"Yay! If it's interesting, I'll issue a bonus ticket that adds to the SP assessment!"

<b>

Oh, a bonus ticket is appreciated.

If I can deliver fewer socks, it will reduce the hassle.

<b>

"Then, I hope you continue to make me happy. Salad bar, bye!"

"Oh, okay."

<b>

Salad bar? That's not even a greeting, is it, God?

～～ Special Corner: Time-Space God's World Management Strategy, Great Explanation! ～～

<b>

Let's copy the successful worlds!

If you can infinitely copy a world that can recover more energy than the initial investment, you can theoretically earn infinitely!

There might be slight random variations in the arrangement of the worlds, but it's just minor differences like the color of the socks, so it's fine to ignore! Butterfly effect? I don't know that term.

<b>

Also, when developing new ones, it's easier to repurpose creatures from other worlds!

The trick is to prepare the environment, like the composition of elements and air, in the main development star!

Otherwise, you might suddenly die from not being able to breathe the moment you repurpose them. Seriously. That was a panic.

<b>

God: "And this is how parallel worlds and other worlds with people are born. See? It's easy, right?"

Karina: "Wow, this is educational! Except for the one point that it's impossible to imitate!"
