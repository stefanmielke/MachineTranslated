# Lies

<blank>

I'm Karina. I was ordained by God's lying words.

...... Oops, time has stopped. Is it God's time? Well, God stops time rather casually. He is really a god of time and space.

<blank>

No, I'm not lying. I'm serious.

Really?

I mean, Sati, you never looked for your sister in the first place. If he was looking for her, he would have found her at Sola Shidore.

<blank>

Hmm?

If you ask me, that may be true. Because Isiah was sold to Solacidore last month. Alicia was at Sola Sidore on the day I had a drink with Sati.

If Satitan was looking for Isiah, it is such a near miss that I have to say it is an irony of fate.

<blank>

"Maybe they thought it would be easier to get permission to enter the elven country if they said they were looking for my sister rather than just for alcohol.

Ahh. Satitan could be."

But that part?　That's the calculating part?"

I love it, it's adorable!"

<blank>

Yay, and air high-five.

<blank>

I think it would be a good idea to let her meet him in person.

Oh, because Isiah is really your sister?"

'I really am your sister. Oh, and I have something important to tell you. Listen to me with all your heart.'

<blank>

I wondered what it was. I brace myself.

<blank>

The socks Satyan is wearing now are reproductions made by Karina-chan, so don't dedicate them to me!　But I don't mind if Karina-chan keeps them for herself! ...... End of communication. Over

<blank>

Is that important?

...... I guess it's important from God's point of view. I guess it's important from God's point of view. I can't shake it.

<blank>

<blank>

Time to get moving.

Hmmm...God's last word has completely slipped my mind.

<blank>

Or rather, for myself. I have a hobby of loving smelly socks for me ...... What is that? Just thinking of Sati-tan's smelly socks makes my heart pound.

Well, I've had my proclivities planted on an instinctive level, I ...... oops. So, Saty's socks, which score 100 points without any hesitation, are the best for me.

<blank>

I feel like ...... that's not so bad either, I kinda hate that!

<blank>

<blank>

As I was slightly depressed like that, Aisia came into the inn.

<blank>

Oh. Master!　Welcome back!"

Oh, Isiah. "Oh, Isiah, you're back. Welcome back.

<blank>

Aisia has been checking out the surrounding eating places. Goodness gracious, I pat her on the head.

...... Sati-tan's sister, huh? I wonder if this innocence is an act if it is Sati-tan. ...... Yeah. Well, that's a good point. She's cute as a button.

<blank>

Well, Isiah's sister is here.

What?" Which one is ......?　Pastel?　Ghana?　Sati?"

"I'm Satitan and I'm ...... do you have any other sisters?"

By the way, I have two brothers, four sisters, and three brothers.

<blank>

You have so many children, Dwarf!

<blank>

Oh no, we are all brothers and sisters in a tribe, dwarves.

Uh, like that."

I'm sure my mothers told me that my father was a traveling minstrel as well. My mothers told me that my father was probably a traveling minstrel.

<blank>

You are so uninhibited, Dwarf!

That would also make them feel like brothers and sisters in the category of everyone's children, regardless of who gave birth to them.

<blank>

Well, can I ask him to come over anyway?"

Yes, Master. I will not forgive you for avenging me, even if you are my sister.

I'm sure she's a friend of yours. I heard they're looking for Isiah, in case you're wondering."

"Oh, that's probably a lie. Basically, I'm a girl who only thinks about drinking."

<blank>

You know my nature, Sati-tan.

So I took Isiah back to my room.

<blank>

Then, an emotional meeting!

<blank>

I'm home, Sati-tan. I brought your sister.

Oh, welcome back crunchy...... eh?"

<blank>

Sati-tan looks at me and her eyes widen in astonishment.

<blank>

...... saty."　Long time no see!"

Oh, ay sister!　What are you doing here ......? I missed you, Ai!"

<blank>

Sati-tan embraces Aisia while crying, "Wahhh!

But I saw it. I saw that there were no tears in his eyes!

<blank>

What's this all about?　What does this mean? It's really you. ...... I didn't know you were still alive. What's more, why is he here?

I don't know. Mattakuno, guuzen da yo."

It's bullshit."

<blank>

I tried to imitate God, but it was still a lie. I knew it.
