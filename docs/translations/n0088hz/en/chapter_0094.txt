# So Fishy

<b>

I'm Karina-chan. I've received a divine message from the god with some fishy words.

...Oops, time has stopped. Is it god time? Speaking of which, gods tend to casually stop time. Seriously, a time-space deity.

<b>

『No, I'm not lying. Seriously』

"Really?"

『Because, to begin with, Sati-chan hasn't searched for her sister at all. If she had been looking, she should have found her at Sorashidore, right?』

<b>

Hmm?

Now that you mention it, that might be true. After all, Aisia was sold to Sorashidore last month. On that day when I drank all night with Sati-chan, Aisia was also at Sorashidore.

If Sati-chan had been searching for Aisia, it would be a cruel twist of fate.

<b>

『Maybe when entering the Elf country, she thought it would be easier to get permission by saying she was looking for her sister rather than for alcohol.』

"Ah, that sounds like something Sati-chan would do."

『But that's the thing? That calculating side of her?』

"That's cute, I love it!"

<b>

Yay, with an air high-five.

<b>

『I think it would be good to let Aisia-chan meet her in a way that feels like a personal appearance.』

"Ah, is Aisia really her sister?"

『She really is her sister. Oh, and there's something important I need to tell you. Listen carefully.』

<b>

Hmm, what could it be? I brace myself.

<b>

『The socks Sati-chan is currently wearing are replicas made by Karina-chan, so don't offer them to me! But it's totally fine if Karina-chan keeps some for herself! ...That's all, communication ended. Over.』

<b>

Is that really important???

...It must be important from the god's perspective. Yeah. Unwavering.

<b>

<b>

Time starts moving again.

Hmm, the last words from the god completely took the wind out of my sails.

<b>

Speaking of which, for personal use. I don't have a hobby of admiring smelly socks... wait, what is this? Just imagining Sati-chan's smelly socks makes my heart race.

Now that I think about it, I had my fetishes ingrained at a primal level... oh dear. So that means Sati-chan's socks, which naturally score a perfect 100, are a top-notch item for me.

<b>

...I feel like that's not so bad, which is kind of annoying!!!

<b>

<b>

As I was feeling a bit down like that, Aisia entered the inn.

<b>

"Ah. Master! Welcome back!"

"Oh, Aisia. You came back, huh? Welcome back to you too."

<b>

Aisia checked the surrounding dining places. I gently pat her head.

...Sati-chan's sister, huh? This innocent vibe, I wonder if Sati-chan would act like this... yeah. Well, that would be fine too. Cutesy in a calculated way.

<b>

"By the way, Aisia, your sister is here."

"Eh? ...Which one? Pastel? Ghana? Sati?"

"It's Sati-chan... but do you have other sisters?"

"By the way, I have two younger brothers, four older sisters, and three older brothers."

<b>

That's a lot of kids for a dwarf!?

<b>

"Oh no, everyone is siblings in the tribe, you see, with dwarves."

"Ah, I see."

"After all, when everyone gets drunk, it's hard to tell who did what with whom. I think my dad is probably a traveling bard, or so my mom says."

<b>

Dwarves are really free-spirited!!

No wonder it becomes a sibling relationship regardless of who gave birth to whom.

<b>

"Well, can I have them come over for now?"

"Yes, Master. If they harm you, I won't hold back, even if they're my sisters."

"Don't worry, they're friends. Apparently, they're looking for Aisia, just in case?"

"Ah, that's probably a lie. She's basically only thinking about alcohol."

<b>

Sati-chan's true nature is exposed.

So, I took Aisia and headed back to the room.

<b>

And then, the emotional reunion!

<b>

"I'm back, Sati-chan! I brought my sister!"

"Ah, welcome back, Karikari... huh?"

<b>

Sati-chan looks at me, her eyes wide with shock.

<b>

"...Sati! It's been a while!"

"Ah, Ai-nee!? W-what are you doing here... ah, no, I missed you so much, Ai-nee!"

<b>

Waaah, Sati-chan clings to Aisia, crying.

But I saw it. There were no tears in her eyes at all!

<b>

"Hey, Karikari, what's going on? This is the real deal... I didn't hear she was alive. And why is she here?"

"I don't know! Totally, absolutely, no idea!"

"That's so fishy."

<b>

I tried to mimic the god, but it still felt fishy. I knew it.
