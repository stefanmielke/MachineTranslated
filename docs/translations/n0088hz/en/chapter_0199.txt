# Tamer Special Tournament "Demon Familiar Cup"

<b>

<b>

Tamer Special Tournament "Demon Familiar Cup".

It is the gateway for those who wish to make a name for themselves as tamers.

<b>

If one places highly in this tournament, they can qualify to participate in the biggest showcase held once a year, the "Great Demon Familiar Cup".

Therefore, the eyes of the competitors entering the "Demon Familiar Cup" were filled with ambition.

<b>

Amidst this, a delicate girl, like a single beautiful flower, came to register for the tournament.

An elf girl with silver hair flowing, dressed in a black gothic dress.

The man at the reception thought she might have mistakenly registered for the beginner tournaments like the "Demon Familiar Race" or "Demon Familiar Tournament".

<b>

"Miss, this is the registration for the 'Demon Familiar Cup'. It's not a beginner tournament, you know?"

"Ah, yes. I'm fine."

<b>

At the reception, the girl presented her D-rank adventurer guild card and filled out the necessary information on the registration form.

<b>

Tamer name: Dia. Demon Familiar: Arthur. That's all.

<b>

"Oh, you only have one demon familiar?"

"Yes. Um, is it a problem if I don't have several?"

"Not necessarily, but..."

<b>

However, it is naturally advantageous to have multiple demon familiars to win.

For that reason, most participants in the "Demon Familiar Cup" prepare the maximum allowable number of six familiars to compete.

<b>

"Don't cry if you lose, okay?"

"I'm fine."

<b>

The girl smiled sweetly, causing the man's heart to race.

He thought that if this girl were to cry, he would want to lend her his chest to comfort her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

And thus, the Demon Familiar Cup began.

It was a tournament with 16 participants. This time, there were exactly 16 entries, so there would be no need for observers, and no participant would have to play more matches than others.

<b>

Additionally, there would be betting on the predicted winners in this Demon Familiar Cup. While it wasn't as large as in higher-level tournaments, it was still a significant gambling event.

<b>

The odds for the unknown participant "Dia" were 20 to 1. It was quite a long shot.

Normally, the odds would be much larger, but Dia had placed a bet of four gold coins on herself, which settled the odds at this level.

<b>

<b>

As other participants entered the venue with their demon familiars, Dia did not have any with her.

Instead, she wore a frilly black dress that one would not even see at a noble's dance.

Clearly out of place—such gazes were directed at Dia.

<b>

"Dia, where is your demon familiar? If you don't have even one, you'll be disqualified!"

"Ah. I'm sorry. I'll summon it now."

<b>

With that, Dia held a small orb in her hand. It was the size of a palm.

What kind of tiny demon familiar could fit into that orb? Other participants wondered.

<b>

"Come out, Arthur."

<b>

She tossed the orb, and it cracked open, revealing her demon familiar—

<b>

"GYUA AAAAAAAAHHHH!!"

<b>

<b>

—A Thunder Dragon.

<b>

It was an extraordinary presence that easily brushed aside the disadvantage of having only one demon familiar.

How could such a massive creature, the size of a carriage, have fit into that small orb? How was that possible?

<b>

No, it must be a mystical tool that allows one to command a dragon.

<b>

<b>

"Now, shall we begin the first match?"

<b>

That smile was both angelic and reminiscent of a grim reaper.
