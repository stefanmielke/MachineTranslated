# "The Followers' Cup," a competition specializing in tamers

<blank>

The "Followers' Cup," a tournament dedicated to tamers.

It is a gateway to success for those who want to make a name for themselves as tamers.

<blank>

The top finishers in this competition will qualify for the "Grand Obedience Cup," the biggest showcase of the competition, which is held once a year.

Therefore, the eyes of the competitors in the "Followers' Cup" were full of ambition.

<blank>

Then a pretty, single flower-like girl came to enter the competition.

An elf girl with silver hair and a black gothic dress.

The man at the reception desk wondered if this was an entry mistaken for the "Squire's Race" or "Squire's Tournament," which are competitions for beginners - and he thought it was a mistake.

<blank>

'Miss, this is the registration desk for the 'Squire's Cup'. This isn't a beginner's tournament, okay?"

Oh, yes. I'm fine."

<blank>

At the reception desk, a girl presents her D-rank adventurer's guild card and fills out a reception form.

<blank>

Tamer name, Dia. Squire: Arthur. Above.

<blank>

"Oh, you only have one follower?"

Yeah. Oh, did you have to have several of them or something?"

Not really, though."

<blank>

But, of course, it is better to have more than one follower to win.

For this reason, most of the contestants in this "Followers' Cup" are fully prepared to challenge up to six, the maximum number that can be entered in the competition.

<blank>

Don't cry for me when I lose, okay?"

I'm fine.

<blank>

The man's heart pounded in his chest when he saw the girl smiling at him.

If this child cries, I want to lend him my chest, I thought.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And so began the Followers' Cup.

It is a 16-player tournament. With exactly 16 entrants this time, there were no observers, and no players who would have to play more matches than the others due to excess.

<blank>

And in this followers' cup, there will be betting on who will win. It is not as big as the top competitions, but it is a gamble that involves a fair amount of money.

<blank>

The payout rate for the unknown player "Dia" was 20 times. It was a pretty big hole.

Normally, the multiplier would have been much higher, but he had four gold coins to wager on himself (players can only bet on themselves), so he settled on this multiplier.

<blank>

<blank>

While the other contestants entered the hall with their followers, Dia did not.

And she wears a frilly, fluttery black dress that you don't see even in aristocratic dance halls.

Clearly out of place - such a gaze is directed at Dia.

<blank>

Dear player. What about the followers?　If you don't have one, you're disqualified, okay?"

Oh. I'm sorry. I'll let you out now."

<blank>

And Dia held a ball in his hand. It is a ball the size of the palm of your hand.

How small a follower is it to be in that ball?　the other contestants thought.

<blank>

"Come on out, Arthur."

<blank>

I threw the ball, and it broke and a follower came out.

<blank>

GUAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

<blank>

<blank>

--Thunder Dragon.

<blank>

It was an extraordinary existence that lightly brushed aside the disadvantage of having only one follower.

Was a huge body the size of a carriage in that little ball that went back into his hand? How.

<blank>

No, perhaps it must be a mystical tool capable of ministering to dragons.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, let's get game one underway."

<blank>

His smile was both angelic and grim.
