# Dungeon attack once again

<blank>

I, Karina-chan.

I'm currently copying my homemade Carina-chan potion (with the names of the ingredients listed as they are).

To copy something that contains magic power consumes more magic power than the copy source, so it is in the red in terms of magic power. However, we are putting the surplus into a form that can be preserved. This loss is more like a deposit!

<blank>

The original amount was about 5 small bottles, but after repeated photocopying, I think I have about 30 bottles worth. I'm putting it all together with direct space magic, but I really need to go buy some bottles.

<blank>

Oh, I'm already dizzy. Let's go to bed today: ......

I leave the room at the inn to Mr. Dear and go to the base for a good night's sleep. Isiah continues to stay in Sati's room today.

<blank>

Ahhh, my own bed is so relaxing. Yeah.

<blank>

When I was wrapped in a blanket at ......, I suddenly remembered the socks that Satitan gave me.

Oh well, I guess I don't have to deliver this to God. Kumkum......Kumkum, the smell is so thick it's as if cheese has been stuffed up my nose......, why am I unconsciously sniffing Sati-tan's socks!

And you unknowingly saved the original and a copy of it!

God's own sexual propensity!

<blank>

And I'm so excited that my body ain't listening ......!　This is the power of socks......!　Oh no, I don't want to be defeated by socks!



<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

I couldn't beat the socks. ...... Oh my God. Ah, the sun is shining brightly.

I took a bath and then left the base to join Mr. Deere.

<blank>

Hmmm, I'm not sleeping well, but my magic is full of energy. I wonder why. ......

<blank>

Good morning, sister."

Good morning."

<blank>

So today's Dear-kun is a boy version. Yeah, yeah, he's cute.

<blank>

Hey, you took a bath in the morning."

Yes, a morning bath is nice. Why don't you come in too?

I said, "...... No, you and Sati are planning to go to the dungeon today, aren't you?　Won't they know?"

<blank>

Well, this inn doesn't have a bath.

Well, there is a bathhouse in town, so let's fool ourselves into thinking we went there.

<blank>

But she's my Satyan, and if she's Isiah's sister, I guess that makes her a relative. If she finds out, then so be it.

If it's okay with your sister, that's fine."

<blank>

Especially if they find out, there is no punishment. Satitan would keep quiet if I asked him to.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, once again, it is a dungeon attack.

Today we are a party of four, including Sati-tan. We paid the entrance fee and entered the dungeon.

<blank>

So, Crunchy. How far do you want to go?"

I guess so. Where shall we go to attack it, Mr. Dear?"

Then let's attack all the way to the boss, shall we? Please keep an eye out for us, Ms. Isiah."

I understand!"

<blank>

We are diving into the dungeon. Crawlers, Grasshoppers, and Yellow Hornets attack us, but they are nothing to worry about if we are careful.

<blank>

"Wow, Ai's sister is really useful for spotting."

Sati is the one. I've never seen you fight wielding a liquor bottle before, but it was like that."

<blank>

Sati-tan is an iron liquor bottle tied with a string like a nunchuck. She swings it around and smashes her enemies like a nunchuck, and even fries the alcohol in it.

Are you okay?　No decrease in mass, no decrease in attack power?　Oh, the buff is more than the buff, so no problem. I brought some alcohol to replenish, so I'm fine. Heh.

<blank>

I'll stow the Hornet, then.

<blank>

Satitan snaps off the crushed head from the carcass and shoves it into her bag.

<blank>

The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the porters are there to help you bring back a lot of your stuff. ...... but I think Ai's bag holds a lot more than it looks. ......?"

'Sati, I'm drunk. It's just my imagination. This is just an ordinary bag I borrowed from you.

I see, I must be imagining things."

<blank>

Sati-tan laughing. Well, drunks are cute. I like her. I want to take her home.

<blank>

"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee air cutters!"

I'm surprised you use that kind of magic, Crunchy. Isn't Crowler strong too, like cutting your head in half?"

"Hmmm. I'm the strongest, you know?　Oh, but I'll probably lose to Sati-tan in terms of cuteness!

Haha, I'm not going to lose in a drinking contest. You can't beat me in a drinking contest, right?　If you don't cheat. Let's do it when I get home today."

I'll do it!"

<blank>

Wow, I made a promise I didn't think I'd make, but it's a drinking contest! And no cheating. I don't think I can win this one. I'm excited that I'm going to lose.

<blank>

And so, as I strolled comfortably through the dungeon, I arrived in front of a room with a large door with relief - an artifact with an obviously floating atmosphere at the end of several descending stairs.
