# Dungeon Strategy Again

<b>

I am Karina-chan.

Right now, I'm copying my homemade Karina-chan potion (with the ingredient names written as they are).

To copy something that contains magical power, it consumes more magical power than the original, so it's a loss in terms of magic. But since I'm turning the surplus into a storable form, this loss is more like a deposit fee!

<b>

Originally, it was about the amount of five small bottles, but after repeating the copying, it has become about thirty bottles worth. I'm gathering it directly with spatial magic, but I really need to go buy some bottles.

<b>

Ah, I'm already feeling dizzy. I think I'll just go to sleep now...

Leaving the room at the inn to Dia-kun, I decide to sleep soundly at the base. Aisia is still in Satitan's room today.

<b>

Ahh, my own bed is so comforting. Yes.

<b>

...As I wrap myself in the blanket, I suddenly remember the socks I received from Satitan.

Come to think of it, I don't need to deliver these to the god. Sniff sniff... Ugh, it smells so strong, like cheese stuffed in my nose... Wait, why am I unconsciously sniffing Satitan's socks!?

Moreover, I'm unconsciously preserving the original and copying it!!

Scary, the god's influence on my fetishes is terrifying!

<b>

And my body is so excited that it won't listen to me...! This is the power of the socks...! No, no, I don't want to lose to the socks!

Ugh, I won't succumb to such socks... Sigh, haah, haah, it stinks...

<b>

＊　＊　＊

<b>

I couldn't win against the socks... Curse you, god. Ah, the sun is so bright.

Well, since I smelled so bad all over, I took a bath before leaving the base to meet up with Dia-kun.

<b>

Hmm, I'm a bit sleep-deprived, but my magical power is full. I wonder why...

<b>

"Good morning, big sister."

"Good morning!"

<b>

Today, Dia-kun is in boy mode. Yes, yes, so cute.

<b>

"Oh, you took a bath in the morning, huh?"

"Yeah, morning baths are nice. Why don't you take one too, Dia-kun?"

"...No, you're planning to go to the dungeon with Satitan today, right? Won't it be a problem?"

<b>

Come to think of it, this inn doesn't have a bath.

Well, there are bathhouses in town, so I can just say I went there.

<b>

"But since it's my Satitan, and if Aisia is her sister, it should be fine as family. If it gets found out, we'll deal with it then."

"If that's what you want, then it's fine."

<b>

There's no punishment even if it's found out. If it's Satitan, she would probably keep quiet if I asked her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, here we are again for dungeon exploration.

Today, it's a four-person party including Satitan. We pay the entrance fee and head into the dungeon.

<b>

"So, Karikari. How far are we going to explore?"

"Well, how far should we go, Dia-kun?"

"Then, let's go all the way to the boss. Aisia-san, please do the scouting."

"Understood!"

<b>

We dive into the dungeon. Crawlers, grasshoppers, and yellow hornets attack us, but as long as we're careful, they're not a problem at all.

<b>

"Wow, Aii-nee is really convenient for scouting."

"Satitan, you too. It's the first time I've seen you fight while swinging a sake bottle, but that's how it is, huh?"

<b>

Satitan has a metal sake bottle tied with a string like nunchucks. She's swinging it around and really smashing the enemies like nunchucks, and she's even taking a swig of the sake inside.

Is she okay? Won't the decrease in mass lower her attack power? Oh, but the buffs outweigh that, so it's fine. She brought extra sake too, so it's all good. Wow.

<b>

"Alright, I'll store the hornet."

<b>

Satitan rips off the crushed head from the corpse and stuffs it into her bag.

<b>

"It's great to have a porter because we can bring back a lot. ...But Aii-nee's bag seems to hold a lot more than it looks...?"

"Satitan is just drunk. It's just your imagination. This is an ordinary bag borrowed from my master, okay?"

"I see, just my imagination then."

<b>

Satitan laughs cheerfully. Hmm, drunk Satitan is cute. I like her. I want to take her home.

<b>

"Hey, Air Cutter!"

"Karikari, you use magic like that? Isn't it strong to split a crawler's head in half?"

"Hehe. You see, I'm the strongest, okay? But in terms of cuteness, I might lose to Satitan!"

"Ahaha. I won't lose in a drinking contest, you know? As long as there's no cheating. Let's do it when we get back today."

"Okay, let's do it!"

<b>

Wow, I just made a promise to have a drinking contest. And no cheating. I don't feel like I can win. I think I'll lose—I'm excited.

<b>

As we casually explore the dungeon, we arrive at a room with a clearly out-of-place artificial object—a large door with reliefs—after going down several flights of stairs.
