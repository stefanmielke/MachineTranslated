# Solacidore, I have returned!

<blank>

I, Karina-chan!　Solacidore, I am back!

First, we had to check at the gate. I was thinking of using my universal ID card for Dia, but I heard that he has his own ID card, so I asked him to use it.

<blank>

Hello, gatekeeper. I'm Karina Shonin, a peddler.

'Hmmm, a peddler for the Merchant's Guild. ...... hmm?　Is the girl over there with you?　Let me see your ID."

Um, here you go.

"......!　This is an apology!　Please come through!"

<blank>

When I saw the pendant that Dear-kun pulled out of his chest, the gatekeeper, obviously with a different attitude than mine, was willing to let me through.

Maybe it's an aristocratic one. My luggage is also unchecked. I made sure they could see what was inside. Well, I only stocked up on lotions and massage equipment.

<blank>

Let's get to the Adventurers' Guild right away."

Yes, sister!"

<blank>

I took Dear's small, soft hand and headed for the Adventurer's Guild.

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

When I opened the door of the Adventurers' Guild, the inside was full of adventurers in their own right.

And my boobs that are the center of attention. That's why they know. ...... No, you're looking at this, Dear. Well, she's a cute little elf girl, isn't she? I mean, she's a guy's girl, but still.

<blank>

I've never been to the Adventurers' Guild before, but this is what it's like.

'Velarde's had the same feeling. Oh, it's Braid senior. Oh, hi!"

<blank>

Just then, I found Braid and his seniors having a drink. I call out to them.

<blank>

Oh Karina, I see you're back from Velarde. I wasn't worried about you coming back from Velarde, but I'm glad to see you're doing well. ...... Who is that guy?　Is he your illegitimate son?"

'Yes, my sweet child--I mean, how could it be? Do I look like such a big kid to this me?"

I don't see it. It looks like an elf and it doesn't look like a ...... slave, but there is a reason. Is he a monster or what?"

"Hmmm, Dear, as you can see at ......, you're super cute!　She's super-smart and healty and great, isn't she?　That's why I made you my companion."

Oh, oh. You sure are cute. ...... I'm Blade. Nice to meet you.

Oh, yes. My name is Dia. Pleased to meet you."

<blank>

Dia-kun bows his head to the senior braiders with a bow.

<blank>

Then let's register as adventurers and party, Dear!

Hey Karina. I was just wondering why you call a girl by your name."

Oh, I'm a guy.

"...... Oh. Well, what the heck. I know it was Carina anyway, but if you don't like it, let me know. I'll at least shelter you."

<blank>

With a single word from Mr. Dear, Braid senior instantly made a judgment on the situation.

What the heck, like I'm the root of all evil.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, Dia's registration as an adventurer was completed in no time.

He had proper identification and could pay the registration fee, so he got an F from the start.

I spoke to the receptionist to get the party together as it were.

<blank>

What would you like to name your party?"

'Oooh. ...... Dear, do you have anything good?"

Yes?"　Yes, that's right. How about "fakers," which means mainly peddlers? It means peddler."

"Oh, that looks good. I'll go with Fakers."

I'll go and take care of it. Then I will go through the formalities.

<blank>

And when the receptionist leaves, Mr. Dear quietly overhears me.

<blank>

Faker also means 'deceiver. I thought it would be perfect for my sister Karina, who has a dark side.

I was like, "Seriously, you thought that far in just one second?　Wow, you're a genius. ......"

I'm sorry ....... I've actually been thinking about the party name for a while."

What's that, you were looking forward to partying with me?　Cute, huh? ......"

<blank>

Thus, Dia and I formed the party "Fakers.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, I would like to make a quick profit and promote you, Deere, to the E rank.

Lumberjacks are ...... Oh, the purchase price is gutted, it's half the price. It's bad for ...... people who are lumberjack adventurers in their day jobs, and I'm not going to go any further.

<blank>

I wonder if there are any requests that would be profitable and easy for us. It would be best if it's hard for others and easy for us. Hmm?　Taking down a wild boar?

I think it's a wild boar I hunted the day before yesterday or so. Let's deliver it. The part that proves the kill is the tusk, and if possible, the fur. Hmmm...hmmm.

<blank>

I said, "Excuse me, I probably hunted this, can I have a look at it?"

<blank>

I decided to deliver boar pelts and tusks.

<blank>

'Yes yes yes ...... ah, yes. Definitely wild boar tusks and fur. ......The stripping is messy and there's a lot of meat on it, but there's no noticeable damage to the fur and it's fresh and recent. ...... Well, if you include the delivery of the fur, the reward is two large silver coins. ...... Let's see. That's one large silver coin per party, right?"

Oh, so maybe?"

<blank>

As I recall, if you earn one silver coin in a month, you will be promoted to rank E.

<blank>

Yes. Well, in the meantime, I can rank up Deere's rank, but would you like to ......?　I wouldn't recommend it, though, because it feels so overtly raised."

<blank>

This is what is called power leveling of the adventurer's rank. This is not a recommended practice, however, because it only raises one's rank and makes one an adventurer with no real ability.

And the fact is, Dear, you seem to be an aristocrat, and I was the only one who took down the beast. Yeah, it's nothing but a raise.

<blank>

I'll give them the same rank as me. Well, I'm only an apprentice E rank, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem. Dia, can I?"

"...... Well, I think I'll only be an adventurer with my sister Karina. Please turn it up."

Congratulations on your promotion to the rank of E."

<blank>

Thus, Dia became an E-rank adventurer just one day after registering.

As for whether it is the fastest record, well, I heard that it is the fastest, but it is not a noteworthy record because it is an occasional story when it is raised. Maru.
