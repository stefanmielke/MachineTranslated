# Sorashidore, I have returned!

<b>

I am Karina-chan! Sorashidore, I have returned!

First, let's check at the gate. I was thinking of using my universal ID if necessary, but it seems that Dia-kun has a proper ID, so we'll use that.

<b>

"Hey there, gatekeeper. I'm the traveling merchant Karina Shonin."

"Hmm, you're a traveling merchant from the Merchant Guild... Hmm? Is that girl with you? Show me her ID."

"Um, here you go."

"…! I-I apologize for the oversight! Please, go right ahead!"

<b>

When the gatekeeper saw the pendant that Dia-kun took out from his chest, he let us through with a clearly different attitude.

He must be a noble or something. My luggage went through without any checks. I had prepared it so that it wouldn't matter if they looked inside. Well, all I had were lotion and massage tools anyway.

<b>

"Alright, let's head to the Adventurers' Guild right away."

"Yes, big sister!"

<b>

I took Dia-kun's small and soft hand and headed towards the Adventurers' Guild.

<b>

<b>

When I opened the door to the Adventurers' Guild, it was filled with adventurers to a considerable extent.

And my breasts were attracting attention. So they noticed... no, Dia-kun is looking at them. Well, she is a cute elf girl. Even if she is a boy.

<b>

"Wow, this is my first time at the Adventurers' Guild, and it's like this."

"It was the same in Veraldo. Oh, there's Blade-senpai. Long time no see!"

<b>

I spotted Blade-senpai and the others who were drinking. I called out to them.

<b>

"Hey, Karina. You’re back from Veraldo. I wasn’t worried, but it’s good to see you’re well… So, who’s that? Your secret child?"

"Yeah, my cute child—wait, there's no way I have such a big child, does it look like I do?"

"It doesn't look like it, she seems like an elf... and she doesn't seem to be a slave, but does she have some kind of backstory? Is she something extraordinary?"

"Hehe, Dia-kun is... as you can see, super cute! Super smart and healing, isn't it the best? So I made him my companion."

"O-Oh. She is indeed cute. …I’m Blade. Nice to meet you."

"Ah, yes. My name is Dia. Nice to meet you."

<b>

Dia-kun bowed slightly to Blade-senpai and the others.

<b>

"Alright, let’s get you registered as an adventurer and form a party, Dia-kun!"

"Hey, Karina. I was a bit curious, but calling a girl by 'kun'..."

"Ah, I’m a boy."

"…Oh. Well, you know, it’s probably Karina’s doing, but if you ever feel uncomfortable, just let me know. I can hide you, at least."

<b>

Blade-senpai made a quick judgment of the situation with Dia-kun's words.

What the heck, it’s like I’m the root of all evil.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, Dia-kun's adventurer registration was completed in no time.

He had a proper ID and was able to pay the registration fee, so he started off as an F-rank.

I decided to talk to the receptionist about forming a party right away.

<b>

"What will the party name be?"

"Oh, right... Dia-kun, do you have any good ideas?"

"Um? Well, since we’ll mainly be doing merchant work, how about 'Fakers'? It means traveling merchants."

"Oh, that sounds good. Then let's go with 'Fakers.'"

"Understood. I will take care of the paperwork."

<b>

As the receptionist walked away, Dia-kun quietly whispered in my ear.

<b>

"'Faker' also means 'deceiver.' I thought it would fit perfectly with Karina-onee-san, who has a hidden side."

"Seriously? You thought that much in just a moment? Amazing, are you a genius...?"

"…I’m sorry. I’ve actually been thinking about the party name for a while."

"What? So you were looking forward to forming a party with me? How cute..."

<b>

Thus, Dia-kun and I formed the party 'Fakers.'

<b>

<b>

Now, I want to quickly make some profit and get Dia-kun to E-rank.

As for lumberjacks... oh, the buyback price has dropped significantly, it's half. I feel bad for those who are actually lumberjack adventurers, so I’ll stop here.

<b>

I wonder if there are any easy requests that seem profitable. It would be best if they were difficult for others but easy for us. Hm? Wild Boar extermination?

Is that the boar I hunted a couple of days ago? I should turn it in. The proof of extermination is the tusks, and if possible, they want the fur too. Hmm.

<b>

"Excuse me, I think I hunted this, can you take a look?"

<b>

I decided to turn in the wild boar's fur and tusks.

<b>

"Yes, yes... Ah, yes. This is definitely a wild boar's tusk and fur. …The skinning is rough, and there’s a lot of meat left on it, but there are no noticeable wounds on the fur, and it seems fresh... um, including the fur, the reward will be two large silver coins... so, for the party, that’s one large silver coin each?"

"Oh, could it be?"

<b>

If I earn one silver coin in a month, I can rank up to E-rank.

<b>

"Yes. Well, technically, Dia-chan can rank up... would you like to? I wouldn’t recommend it since it’s quite obvious."

<b>

Ranking up, or what is known as power leveling in adventurer ranks. It seems that nobles sometimes do this to enhance their status, but it’s not recommended as it leads to adventurers whose rank is high but lack the corresponding skills.

And in fact, Dia-kun seems noble, and I did the extermination alone. Yeah, this is nothing but a rank up.

<b>

"Hmm, I guess I’ll raise it to match my rank. Well, it’s just an E-rank novice, so it shouldn’t be too much of a problem. Dia-kun, is that okay?"

"…Well, I think I’ll only be adventuring with Karina-onee-san, so please raise it."

"Understood. Congratulations on your E-rank promotion."

<b>

Thus, Dia-kun became an E-rank adventurer just one day after registration.

As for whether it’s the fastest record, well, it is the fastest, but it’s a common occurrence for rank ups, so it’s not a noteworthy record. That’s that.
