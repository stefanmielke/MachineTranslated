# On a Personal Matter (Apologies if you’re eating!)

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina! A girl who became an adventurer on her way to becoming a merchant!

I thought I was being harassed by a drunken lecher, but it turned out to be just a kind senior adventurer!

So I ended up with a temporary adventurer ID and a tip to cover my post-payment fee!

<b>

That was the story last time.

<b>

Now I’m looking at the medium copper coin that Blade-san, my senior adventurer, tipped me.

It’s enough to buy five black bread rolls, so around 500 yen in Japanese currency—a generous donation.

<b>

<b>

And I have the power to multiply this coin into thousands with my spatial magic skill, Duplication.

Which means, with just one coin, I could become rich.

<b>

<b>

"…"

<b>

But duplicating money feels… off, somehow. Yeah, it just doesn’t feel right.

<b>

If I duplicate money, it becomes counterfeit. Though it would be nearly identical down to the last molecule...

<b>

Money is, after all, just money. While it might be fine for pocket change, I aim to be a merchant.

If I started duplicating money on a commercial scale, it would lead to inflation and collapse the market.

<b>

And it all begins with duplicating a single copper coin.

Once I start duplicating money, it’s easy to lose any resistance to it.

<b>

<b>

If I’m going to duplicate something, maybe it should be goods… though that also feels wrong.

<b>

Goods, after all, are things that someone either makes or gathers for merchants to handle.

As a merchant, if I acquire something, there should naturally be a monetary exchange. Skipping that and just taking the goods doesn’t feel like healthy economic activity.

<b>

"…Duplicating money or goods should be a last resort."

<b>

Besides, with spatial magic, I can earn money in countless ways. A self-imposed rule to avoid using it unless absolutely necessary isn’t a bad idea. Yeah, yeah.

<b>

I decided on this and stowed the medium copper coin in my storage space.

<b>

<b>

<b>

According to this logic, I could duplicate items I gather or make from raw materials.

If I made it myself, it’s just skipping the crafting process! Time saved!

<b>

Since I was granted talent by the gods to easily acquire skills, learning production skills like smithing or magical item crafting could be useful.

<b>

And for items used personally, duplicating is okay.

For instance, if I want to make a sword for myself out of rare metals, I’ll allow duplicating the raw materials. Practicing with materials is also fine, as long as they’re for personal use. Personal use only!

<b>

<b>

"Well, I don’t want to make it too restrictive and ruin the fun… alright."

<b>

Suddenly, I felt the urge to pee. My first time in this world.

Luckily, this is the Adventurers’ Guild. Glad my first pee won’t be outdoors.

<b>

"Excuse me, can I use the restroom?"

"Oh, yes. It’s over there."

"Thanks!"

<b>

Oof, I really have to go now… wait, uh-oh, thinking about it made it worse.

Wait, without… that part, how do you even hold it in?

<b>

…I’m really about to leak.

Restroom, restroom!! Hurry!!

<b>

<b>

When I burst through the door, there were a few people using the men’s urinals. Ew, it reeks of pee. Stronger ammonia smell than the toilets at Shinjuku Station. The development of flush toilets is urgent.

<b>

"Whoa! Hey, miss, this is the men’s restroom!"

"Oops! My bad!"

<b>

Oh right, I’m a girl now. Silly me, Karina.

<b>

"But I can’t hold it! Gotta use the stall!"

"Well… better than wetting yourself, I guess. Watch out for the slime."

<b>

I dashed into the stall, making my first trip to the restroom in another world.

Phew… wait, no toilet paper?

<b>

* * *

<b>

Ah, much better.

Took care of the big business while I was at it.

<b>

According to Basic Knowledge-san, toilets in this world don’t have toilet paper.

They’re managed with the Cleansing spell from life magic. No risk of running out of toilet paper as long as my magic holds up—nice.

<b>

Oh, and there was actually a slime squirming down there!

<b>

And thanks to my restroom trip, the slime got really mad.

It was apparently a Scavenger Slime, specifically trained for men’s and women’s toilets.

Basic Knowledge-san didn’t explain why… maybe it’s a preference thing? Hmm, there’s a lot to it. Or maybe… the slime’s preferences are deep?
