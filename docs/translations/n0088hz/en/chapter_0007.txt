My name is Karina!　A girl who became an adventurer anyway, aiming to become a merchant!

I thought I was tangled up with a drunk who was after my body, but it was just a friendly senior adventurer!

That's how I got my provisional adventurer's ID and the throwaway money for the postpaid fee!

<blank>

That is what I said last time.

<blank>

That's why I look at the medium copper coin that Mr. Braid, a senior adventurer, gave me as a throwaway.

It is like buying 5 pieces of black bread, which is about 500 Japanese yen. It is a little bit like a generous donation.

<blank>

<blank>

And I have the power to increase this to thousands with spatial magic [duplication].

In other words, once I have one coin of currency, I will be a very rich man.

<blank>

<blank>

"......"

<blank>

But increasing money is something different, yes, something different.

<blank>

If you duplicate money, it is counterfeit money. No, it is as real as possible, because it is perfectly replicated down to a single molecule. ......

<blank>

Money is just money. If it is just an allowance for a child, but I am an aspiring merchant.

If money were to increase at the level of merchants' transactions, there would be inflation and the market would collapse.

<blank>

And it would still start with the duplication of a single copper coin.

Once money is duplicated, there is less resistance to duplicate money.

<blank>

<blank>

If you want to duplicate it, the product is ...... No, this is not good either.

<blank>

Merchants deal in products that were made or collected by someone else.

If a merchant is to acquire something, there must be an exchange of money, and if that exchange is omitted and the merchant only acquires goods, it cannot be said to be a sound economic activity.

<blank>

I guess duplicating ...... money and goods is a last resort."

<blank>

You don't have to do that, as long as you have spatial magic, you can make as much money as you want. It's okay to play it by the rules and not use it unless it is absolutely necessary. Yes, yes.

<blank>

I decided to do so and put the medium copper coin away into the storage space.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Incidentally, this theory would allow you to duplicate a product as long as it is made from raw materials that you have collected from your own sources.

If it's something you made yourself, just skip the creation process!　Short time, short time!

<blank>

God has given me talents that make it easier to learn skills, and I can learn production skills like blacksmithing or grimoire making.

<blank>

I'm also OK with things that are not products, but personal items.

For example, if you want to make a sword out of a rare metal for yourself, it is OK to prepare a duplicate of the raw material. Duplicating materials for practice is also acceptable. It is OK as long as you don't sell them.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, I don't want to tie up too many loose ends, so I'm going to go to ......."

<blank>

Suddenly, I had the urge to urinate. It was the first time in this world that I had the urge to urinate.

Fortunately, we are in the Adventurers' Guild. Thank goodness my first pee didn't turn out to be a field pee or something.

<blank>

Excuse me, I need to use your restroom.

Oh, yes. That way."

Domo."

<blank>

Oh, leaky leaky ......, wait a minute, oh no, oh no, it came suddenly when I became aware of it.

Oh, well, how can you stand it if you don't have a stick?

<blank>

...... is seriously going to leak.

Whoa, toilet toilet!　Hurry up!

<blank>

<blank>

When I opened the door with a slam, I found several people peeing standing at the men's urinals. Ugh, they smelled like urine. The ammonia smell was worse than that of the toilets in Shinjuku Station. The development of flush toilets may be an urgent necessity.

<blank>

"Whoa!　Hey, girl, this is the men's room!"

Oops!　Sorry, I made a mistake!"

<blank>

Oh my gosh, now that you mention it, I am a woman. Karina, you inadvertently!

<blank>

But I can't do it anymore!　I'm leaking!　I'm gonna borrow the big one!"

"Ew, well, it's better than shitting my pants. ...... Watch out for the slime..."

<blank>

I rushed straight into the larger toilet and had my first toilet in a different world.

Fuy...... that's just no toilet paper?

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Whew, that was refreshing.

In addition, I did the large one as well.

<blank>

And according to Mr. Basic Knowledge, there is no toilet paper in the bathrooms of other worlds.

They want me to use my life magic [washing] to get by. Thank goodness we never run out of toilet paper if we don't run out of magic.

<blank>

Also, seriously, Mr. Slime was urchining at the bottom!

<blank>

And as a result of my bathroom, Mr. Slime was very angry.

The slime seems to be a scavenger slime or some such variety, and moreover, it seems to be a toilet slime that has been trained separately for men and women.

The reason is unknown because Mr. Basic Knowledge didn't have it. ...... I guess it's a difference in taste. Hmmm, deep. No, slime karma is deep?
