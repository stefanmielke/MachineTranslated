# Underground Tournament

<b>

"Ku ku ku. This tournament is the perfect underground event to take you down!"

"Oh? Shall I ask what the rules are?"

<b>

I decided to participate without asking about the rules. If magic is prohibited, I plan to escape.

However, if magical tools are allowed, I wouldn't mind having the Five Great Elders give it their all.

<b>

"This tournament is—it's a 'Hit, Cover, and Rock-Paper-Scissors Tournament'!!"

"H-Hit, Cover, and Rock-Paper-Scissors!?"

<b>

Why is that game in another world!? ...Well, it seems like it could exist regardless of reincarnation. But that's neither here nor there; if it exists, then it exists!

Why is there a tournament for such a game—especially an underground tournament?

<b>

"And it's not just a regular Hit, Cover, and Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament!!"

"Could it be a bloody one using real swords and helmets...?"

"Huh? No way. Who would participate in such a deadly tournament! That's scary!"

<b>

Oh, so it's not that. Well, I didn't want to kill Misha anyway, so that's fine.

Misha clears her throat.

<b>

"Let me reiterate! It's not just a regular Hit, Cover, and Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament!!"

"Oh, so that means..."

"Strip! It's a Strip Hit, Cover, and Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament!!!"

<b>

Seriously, Misha. You're a genius. Let's be best friends.

<b>

"Ku ku ku, I probably can't win in skill, but if it's Rock-Paper-Scissors! And if it's a speed contest! I should have a chance!!"

<b>

Hehe, if I can bring in socks and have the opponent wear them, I can collect the socks easily...

That tournament is worth way more than any divine artifact!! (In terms of SP)

<b>

Gently, Dia-kun raises his hand.

<b>

"...Um, is it okay if I don't participate?"

"What!? I was really happy when you said you'd protect me..."

"...I'll participate..."

<b>

Dia-kun, confirmed to join! Misha, let's do our best!!

<b>

"Hey, hey. I just casually asked if you wanted to participate, but you don't have to push yourself, okay? I'm fine as long as I can fight this guy..."

"I-I'll do my best..."

"Hey!! You, don't make such a cute girl push herself!!"

<b>

In front of the slightly teary-eyed Dia-kun, Misha shouted.

<b>

"Wait, am I the bad one? It was supposed to be a flow where I teamed up with Misha!"

"Why!? H-Hey, miss. Seriously, you don't have to push yourself, okay? If you lose, you'll be exposed to the gaze of greasy pig beastmen and old men, you know? Even if it's a soft stick wrapped in fur, it still hurts a bit when hit, right?"

"...I'll be fine..."

<b>

Ugh, Dia-kun is so brave...! I want him to do his best! Definitely!!

<b>

"By the way, is that level of content really an underground tournament?"

"Well, in an erotic sense?"

"Ah, I see."

<b>

By the way, it seems the fight money is quite good. I'm not in need of money right now, though!
