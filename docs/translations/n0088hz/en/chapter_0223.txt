# Backdoor Competitions

<blank>

I'm going to go to the back of the room and make a deal with you. This tournament is the perfect backstage tournament to make you look bad!"

Let me ask you what the rules are. Let's hear what the rules are."

<blank>

I decided to join without asking about rules and regulations. If magic is prohibited, I will run away.

But on top of that, if the magic tools are allowed, I am not afraid to ask the Five Elders to give their all.

This tournament is a game of slap, bite, and rock-paper-scissors!

"Oh, you mean like rock-paper-scissors-scissors?

<blank>

Why that game in a different world! ...... seems like this is going to be there, regardless of whether you're a convert or not. Well, that's not the point, if there is one, that's it!

Why is there a convention for such a game - and what is a behind-the-scenes convention for it?

<blank>

"That, too!　It's not just a knock-knock rock-paper-scissors contest!

"Well, don't tell me it's going to be some bloody thing with a serious sword and a real helmet: ......?"

What about?　That's not true. Who would participate in such a death-defying tournament?　That's scary!

<blank>

What's the difference? Well, I didn't want to kill Misha either.

Misha coughs.

<blank>

I'll tell you again!　This isn't just a knock-knock rock-paper-scissors contest!

"Oh, that means ......."

"Undressing!　It's undressing, slapping, covering, and rock-paper-scissors pong!"

<blank>

Seriously, Misha. You're a genius. Let's be best friends.

<blank>

Kukuku, you probably can't beat me in strength, but in rock-paper-scissors-scissors!　And if it's a speed game!　I have a chance to win!

<blank>

If you bring in your socks and have your partner wear them, you can make progress in collecting the socks. ......

That tournament is worth much more than any of the sacred artifacts! (SP)

Gently, Deere raises his hand.

<blank>

......, do you still want me to answer?"

What?　I was so happy you said you would protect me. ......"

"...... out ......"

<blank>

Dear, you are going to participate!　Good luck, Misha!

<blank>

Hey, hey, hey. 　I just need to be able to fight this guy. ......

But I'll do my best. ......

"Hey, hey, hey!　You, don't force yourself on such a pretty girl!

<blank>

Misha barked at Dia, who was slightly tearful.

<blank>

What?　You were just in the process of teaming up with me and Misha!"

Why not?　Oh, hey, girl. You really don't have to do this, do you?　If you lose, you'll be staring at a bunch of greasy old boar-bastards, right?　Even if it's a soft stick made of fur, it's going to hurt a little when you get hit, right?

"...... it's okay ......."

<blank>

Damn, how healthy you are, Deere. ......　I wish you the best!　I hope you do!

<blank>

I mean, is that the extent of the content of a backroom convention?"

Well, erotically speaking?"

Uh, like that."

<blank>

By the way, I hear fight money is pretty good. I'm not in need of money right now, though!
