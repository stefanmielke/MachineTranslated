# Area cutter, or air cutter for short. ● Illustrations are available.

Golem. Apparently, there are sailors on board. The golem, which looks heavy, does not make a hole in the deck even when it walks with a thud, so it must be under the blessing of the sea god.

<blank>

Now we're dealing with a golem. I'm looking forward to it."

<blank>

Two golems lined up in front of me. They looked more like knight's armor than the golem we saw at the port. It looks like a 3-meter tall giant in full body armor. It is ......, but whether it can be my enemy is another story.

<blank>

<blank>

We have two golems, can we destroy one of them? But well, let's disable one of them first.

<blank>

At last, an air cutter!

<blank>

The body fell to the deck with a thud.

The limbs fall cleanly in a spackle. Cables, pipes, and armor show a smooth cross-sectional view.

Gomez sees this and exclaims with wide eyes.

<blank>

What?　That's absurd!　The golem has the blessing of the sea god too!　It shouldn't even get a scratch!

Hmm?　Really?"

<blank>

Maybe it's because it looks like it's spliced off, but it's actually still connected.

With that in mind, I attempt a spatial disconnect this time on the other golem.

<blank>

I'm not sure I can cut it! ...... sure doesn't cut it. Heh, nice work Kago."

<blank>

I tried to handle it with spatial cutting, and this time it bounced off my arm.

I see. If you don't cut it, it's okay, but if you try to hurt it, it will be repelled by the blessing. Spatial magic is magic that God gave me, but it's not a blessing or anything.

<blank>

Hey!　Get him before he gets you!　Get him!

Yes, let's go, Golem!"

Oops."

<blank>

I caught the golem's fist with my arm as it swung down.

It doesn't hurt or itch, after all, it's in a state of invincibility! The deck, protected by the blessing, will not be broken.

<blank>

Tori-ya!"

<blank>

Grab the golem's arm and lift it up.

<blank>

You're kidding!　Don't you know how heavy a golem's body is!"

You don't weigh the golem any differently whether you know it or not." Well, I don't know, but ...... yeah."

<blank>

Then he tossed them off to the lower end of the pirates.

<blank>

I've been stepped on!　I've been stepped on, get out of the way!"

Help me!　It's heavy!

Don't move or we'll crush you!

<blank>

Oh, I guess this means the sailors are protected after all?　Maybe we can ramp it up a bit more.

<blank>

"Damn it, why?　Oh, hey, you guys!　Pour some magic on him!　And guns!　Do it, do it!"

Uh, oh, waterballs!"

Burstwater!"

Blind Mist!

<blank>

Water-based magic is flying towards me. It's chilly and cold, and my vision turns white from the fog.

On top of that, the slingshot was bounced off the body and ricocheted.

Hmmm, that would have been dangerous if I wasn't invincible. I'm invincible, so I'm okay.

<blank>

Did you do it?

<blank>

The fog lifts and Gomez pulls a face when he sees me unharmed.

<blank>

Hi-hi!"

I'm sorry, you didn't do it. That's why you say lines like that, okay?"

I'm not going to let this happen! ...... I'll be damned if I'm going to let this happen. O Poseidon, the great god of the sea!　There is an uninvited guest on board!　Forced to leave the ship!

<blank>

Boom!　And I was burst out of the boat. There is no ...... foothold. I looked down and saw the ocean. I must have been bounced out of the boat.

<blank>

Whoa. Well, well, well. ......"

"Ha-ha-ha, now he's just a speck in the ocean...and he's floating!"

He said, "Oh, what are you shutting me out for? I didn't authorize you to shut me out!"

"Fall into the sea, you bum!　You monster!

<blank>

I can't believe they kicked us off the ship at sea. That's a good idea. Normally, you would certainly sink into the sea and be eaten by sea monsters.

But I can use spatial magic to fix the coordinates so I don't fall. I mean, I can float and fly.

<blank>

What?　I can't go back."

<blank>

...... Yeah, but when I try to get into the boat again, I can't get in there right somehow, you know?　It's like there's a barrier up there.

<blank>

'Fools, I will not enter a ship protected by the blessings of the sea god!　You guys!　Knock him down from the inside!"

<blank>

Cue Gomez's voice, and magic and bullets fly again.

...... ei, the magic tube.

<blank>

'Whoa!　They're fighting back!"

I said, "Oh, no, this is ridiculous!　There's an attack in this boat!"

<blank>

Oh, the attacks we shoot ourselves go back.

But it's a hassle to attack them on their own. It's not like they are friendly enemy characters in the game, and they won't keep attacking us to be returned to us.

In other words, I have to attack them myself. Oh, what a pain in the ass.

<blank>

Super air cutter!"

<blank>

I swung my sword from the side of the boat, and it split in half.

The ship is a mackerel fold with spatial magic (non-cutting). Like a hinge in the center of the cut deck, the bow and stern of the ship began to face the heavens.

<blank>

Woah!"

The ship!　The ship!

"Oh, my arm fell into the ocean!　I got cut and there's no pain and no blood!

<blank>

The abandoned golem falls into the sea. It's a waste of time, so we retrieve it at that moment.

<blank>

Come on, let's all get along and swim in the ocean!　I'll fly, though!"

Baa, stupid, stupid, stupid aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa！！！！"

<blank>

Gomez and every other pirate who was out on deck slid down to the sea.

Oops, let's retrieve the golem. The inside had escaped before I knew it, and I didn't wound it after all, so two unscathed, delicious!

<blank>

And I'll take this one, too."

<blank>

When one passage fell into the sea, the boat was recovered in half into a storage space.

If we keep the whole ship, it means that we could have recovered the sacred artifact "Poseidon", right? Maybe?
