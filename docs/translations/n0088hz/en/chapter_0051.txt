# Area Cutter, abbreviated as Air Cutter. ●Illustration included

<b>

Golem. It seems that there are crew members inside. Even though the heavy-looking golem is stomping around, it doesn't make holes in the deck, so the protection of the sea god must be at work.

<b>

"Well then, a golem as my opponent, huh? I'm looking forward to this."

<b>

Two golems lined up in front of me. They seem to be for combat, even closer to knight armor than the golems I saw at the port. They look like three-meter-tall giants clad in full armor, quite a sight. ...But whether they can be my enemies is another story.

<b>

There are two golems, so I guess it's okay to destroy one of them. But for now, let's neutralize one.

<b>

"Ha! Air Cutter!!"

<b>

As I said that, I used spatial magic to sever its limbs—thud, and the torso fell onto the deck.

The severed limbs fell cleanly. Cables, pipes, and armor show smooth cross-sections.

Seeing this, Gomez's eyes widened, and he shouted.

<b>

"---Huh? No way! The golem is also under the protection of the sea god! It shouldn't even get a scratch!!"

"Hm? Is that so?"

<b>

It looks like it was cut cleanly, but maybe it's still connected somehow.

Thinking that, I attempted spatial severance on the other golem this time.

<b>

"One more Air Cutter! ...Indeed, it can't be cut. Huh, impressive protection."

<b>

As I tried to process it with spatial severance, this time I was deflected by its arm.

I see. If I don't cut it, it's fine, but if I try to injure it, I get repelled by the protection. Spatial magic is a gift from the gods, but it's not protection, after all.

<b>

"Hey! Attack before you get attacked! Capture it!"

"I'm going, golem!"

"Oh no."

<b>

I caught the golem's fist with my arm.

It didn't hurt at all; after all, I'm in an invincible state! The protected deck won't break either.

<b>

"Take that!"

<b>

I grabbed the golem's arm and lifted it.

<b>

"Are you kidding me!? Don't you know how heavy a golem's body is!?"

"Whether I know or not, the weight of the golem doesn't change. Well, I don't know... here goes!"

<b>

And then I threw it towards the pirate's underlings.

<b>

"Gyah!? I got stepped on, get it off me!"

"Help me! It's heavy!"

"Don't move, or I'll get crushed!"

<b>

Oh, I wonder if the crew is also protected? I might be able to cause a bit more chaos.

<b>

"Damn it, why!? Hey, you guys! Cast magic on it! And guns too! Do it, do it!"

"Uh, uh, Water Ball!"

"Burst Water!"

"Blind Mist!"

<b>

Water-based magic flew towards me. It's chillingly cold, and the mist obscures my vision.

On top of that, bullets ricocheted off my body with a pop pop.

Hmm, if I weren't in an invincible state, this would have been dangerous. But since I'm invincible, it's fine.

<b>

"Did we get it!?"

<b>

As the mist cleared, Gomez's face twisted upon seeing me unscathed.

<b>

"---Eek!"

"Too bad, it didn't work. That's what you get for saying such lines, right?"

"You monster! ...If it’s come to this, there's no helping it. Great sea god, Poseidon! There are unwelcome guests on my ship! Force them to disembark!!"

<b>

With a bang!! I was flung out of the ship. ...There's no footing. Looking down, it's the sea. I must have been bounced off the ship.

<b>

"Oh. Well, well..."

"Haha, how about that? Now that guy will be nothing but seaweed—wait, he's floating!?"

"Hey, why are you locking me out? I don't permit my own exclusion!"

"Fall into the sea! You monster!!"

<b>

Being thrown out of a ship onto the sea, huh? Impressive. Normally, I would indeed sink and be eaten by sea monsters.

However, I can stay afloat by fixing my coordinates with spatial magic. In fact, I can float and fly.

<b>

"Hm? I can't get back in."

<b>

...Yeah, but even when I try to re-enter the ship, I can't seem to do it properly? It feels like there's a barrier up.

<b>

"You fool, do you think you can enter a ship protected by the sea god's blessing? You guys! Shoot that thing down from inside!"

<b>

At Gomez's command, magic and bullets flew towards me again.

...Here goes, magic tube.

<b>

"Whoa!? It's counterattacking!?"

"W-what!? An attack inside this ship!?"

<b>

Oh, so the attacks they fired return to them.

But just doing that to attack is a hassle. They aren't the kind of friendly enemy characters you find in games who would keep attacking themselves.

In other words, I have to attack them myself. Ugh, what a bother.

<b>

"---Super Air Cutter!"

<b>

As I swung my hand blade from the side of the ship, the ship split cleanly in two.

Using spatial magic (non-severing) to fold the ship in half. The center of the cut deck began to tilt upward like a hinge, with the bow and stern pointing towards the sky.

<b>

"Waaah!?"

"The ship! The ship!?"

"My arm fell into the sea!? I was cut, but there's no pain and no blood!?"

<b>

The abandoned golem fell into the sea. Since it's a waste, I'll recover it at that moment.

<b>

"Now, let's all swim happily in the sea! I'll be flying though!"

"Y-you're kidding, kidding, kidding!!!"

<b>

Starting with Gomez, all the pirates on the deck slipped into the sea one by one.

Oh, let me recover the golem. The inside had escaped before I knew it, and since I didn't end up injuring it, I have two unscathed ones—delicious!

<b>

"Oh, and I'll take this too."

<b>

Once everyone fell into the sea, I collected the split ship into my storage space.

If I take the whole ship, that means I can also recover the artifact 'Poseidon,' right? Probably?
