# Dangerous, but looks useful (Carcassa gatekeeper's perspective)

<blank>

(Carcassa gatekeeper's point of view)

<blank>

The town of Carcassa exists in the wilderness. I am the gatekeeper there.

Carcassa has a dungeon. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say that there is nothing but dungeons, and that the town was established where the dungeons were located in the first place. At first, peddlers opened stalls, then inns and stores were established, and then the town developed.

<blank>

Because of this, Carcassa has many merchants coming and going, and there are also many people trying to make a profit illegally. The screening process for entry and exit is quite strict.

<blank>

Especially today, there are regular flights - a system where individuals who want to travel from town to town can get together and hire a joint escort to make it cheaper, which is held on a regular basis - and there are many introductory screenings.

<blank>

<blank>

Next, please.

Yes."

<blank>

And then came the trio. A peddler woman with large breasts, an E-ranked elf child, who was not a hearty adventurer for an escort, and a polite slave were accompanying them. ...... Oh, so this elf is a man. Well, it would have been difficult to tell without seeing his ID.

<blank>

Check the merchant guild certificate - mm?　The date is wrong. This certainly seems to come from Solacidore, but not via any place along the way, and furthermore, the number of days.

<blank>

<blank>

You came from Solacidore to Carcassa in just five days?

<blank>

<blank>

If we were to take a regular flight, it would take a month to get there from Solacidore. And there is no way it would not go into a town along the way.

...... This means that these three people came to this Carcassa without using regular flights and directly to this Carcassa.

<blank>

Could this group of people, consisting only of women and children, travel that fast with such a large load on their backs and without resupplying at the town? Impossible, indeed. Even if they had bargained with the merchants at the encampment to resupply, it would have been impossible.

<blank>

If we strengthened our bodies without any consideration of fatigue and kept moving without rest, and if there were no battles along the way, could we still come to ......5 day?

But even though the girls claim to have come on a forced march, they are blatantly clean ......

<blank>

Anyway, it is suspicious.

<blank>

Uh, this is ......."

We got there very quickly because we used a special vehicle!　We even passed through towns on the way because of the special ride!"

<blank>

When we tried to question them, they would answer ahead of time. I guess they understood beforehand that they would be suspicious too.

<blank>

'What's the special ride?　I don't see you in a carriage either. ......"

I think it would be quicker to see the real thing.

Let's take a look at ......."

<blank>

It is not as if he rode on the back of a dragon. With this in mind, I left the reception desk to the other gate guards and accompanied them outside.

<blank>

So where are those rides?"

This way." ...... wakeup!"

<blank>

The merchant woman cast a spell, and the toy on her hand became a gigantic cart.

Or is it a cart?　The shape is a little odd. It looks like a barrel with a door on the side. There is a window in the front. There was only one wheel sticking out.

<blank>

<blank>

It's a magical tool under development that was lent to me by a great magician named Healer, and it can change size like this, making it convenient to carry around.

"No horses?　You don't mean to say that they were all towed by different people?"

This is a magical tool, so it runs on its own. It's a little dangerous, though."

<blank>

Running by yourself?　Is there such a magical tool?

<blank>

It's kind of like a golem."

'Oh, a golem. Right."

<blank>

If you ask me, golems also walk with people inside them. It was similar.

<blank>

...... This would be useful. It's like a hut, after all, and if you can rest inside, it simplifies a lot the hassle of pitching a tent and keeping watch at night when camping out.

And if this can be run as it is, is their cleanliness understandable?

<blank>

Then, the only other question is the number of days of the move.

<blank>

So, is this thing really that fast?"

I'm not going to lie," he said. However, since we use a lot of magic stones for the golem, it is honestly not worth the cost.

'You're a ...... merchant, aren't you?　Why are you using that?"

I've asked the healer who lent it to me to show me how to use it, and I've kept the magic stone as well. I don't think I would buy it myself.

<blank>

I see. If it's not out of your own pocket, it won't hurt your pocketbook if you spend it.

<blank>

Can you show us the actual run?"

I'm not afraid of you. However, it's dangerous if you're not used to it, so I'll ride alone. ...... away for a bit. I'll go to the big rock over there and come back."

Ah."

<blank>

And the female merchant points to a rock that is a long way away while entering the grimoire.

It is several hundred meters long.

<blank>

Here we go!

Ah--"

<blank>

The next moment when I was about to reply, the magic tool flew out faster than a skilled mage's fire lance!　and the magical tool flew out faster than a skilled mage's firelance. Reaching the target rock at great speed, it made a big turn and came back at that speed--...... is it going to stop?　Oh, hey!

<blank>

When he prepared himself, he stopped, leaving a mark on the ground, like a horse that has been stopped forcefully.

And it stops? Good.

<blank>

It's like this. When the speed is perfect, it goes even faster.

'Okay, okay. You used that, that's why it was five days."

Yeah, yeah. That's right, Mr. Gatekeeper."

<blank>

It was a distance that they had managed to cover in a matter of seconds. It would be easy to force their way through the demons, or even take a shortcut slightly off the road.

However, the 5th or ......

<blank>

"...... this fast could be sold to the country as an emergency messenger, huh?"

Oh, no. This one can kill you just by bumping into it. In fact, I've almost died a few times, and it's probably not for sale yet."

I'm surprised you made it to ......."

Once you get used to it, though, you'll be able to move even faster."

<blank>

Think about it, if they hit a rock at that speed, they would be in big trouble. If it was just a message, it would be safer for the tamer to send a bird.

The female merchant chants, "Shut it down!" and the vehicle's magical tool becomes smaller. I picked it up and put it in my backpack pocket.

Okay, the risk is great, but it seems convenient.

The risks are great, though.

<blank>

So, is everything all right?"

Oh. Well, that won't be a problem. Let's check the rest of your stuff."

Yes. And then there's honey.

...... was that jar safe?"

Huh?"　Oh, oh, I was magically protected. By Mr. Healer!　Oh no, we were safe because we had protection too, otherwise we would have died three times."

<blank>

It seems that this healer, a mage, is also a hell of a magician.

No, if I couldn't do that, I would probably lose my life in the process of making such a magical tool. Yeah.

<blank>

Thus, we were shown an unusual vehicle. Since the rest of the luggage was fine, we gave them permission to pass as normal.

<blank>

<blank>

Operations were successfully completed today.
