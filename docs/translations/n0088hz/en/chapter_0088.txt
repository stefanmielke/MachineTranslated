(Perspective of the Kalcassa Gatekeeper)

<b>

The town of Kalcassa exists in the wilderness. I am the gatekeeper there.

Kalcassa has a dungeon. No, it is more accurate to say that there is nothing but the dungeon, and the town was built in a place where a dungeon exists. At first, merchants set up stalls, and gradually inns and shops were established, leading to the development of the town.

<b>

Due to this history, Kalcassa has a lot of merchant traffic, and many people try to make a profit through illegal means. The scrutiny at the entrance and exit is fairly strict.

<b>

Especially today, there is a regular transport service— a system where individuals wanting to move from town to town gather and collectively hire guards to save costs, which is held regularly— resulting in many entrance inspections.

<b>

<b>

“Next, please.”

“Yay!”

<b>

What arrived was a group of three. A busty female merchant, a rather unreliable E-rank elf child who is a guard adventurer, and a slave servant accompanying them. … Ah, this elf is a boy. I see, it would have been difficult to distinguish without looking at the identification.

<b>

I check the merchant guild certificate— huh? The date is strange. It certainly seems to have come from Solashidore, but it hasn’t passed through any towns along the way, and the number of days is also odd.

<b>

<b>

They arrived from Solashidore to Kalcassa in just five days, did they?

<b>

<b>

If they are using the regular transport service, it should take at least a month from Solashidore. Moreover, they shouldn’t have skipped any towns along the way.

… In other words, these three have come directly to Kalcassa without using the regular transport service.

<b>

Could this group, consisting only of women and children, carry such a large load and move so quickly without resupplying in town? It seems impossible. Even if they negotiated with merchants at a campsite for supplies, it would still be unreasonable.

<b>

If they continued to move without considering fatigue and enhanced their bodies without resting, and if there were no battles along the way… could they really make it in five days?

However, even if they insist they made a forced march, they look too clean…

<b>

In any case, it is suspicious.

<b>

“Ah, this is…”

“We used a special vehicle, so we arrived super fast! Since it’s a special vehicle, we just passed through the towns along the way!”

<b>

Just as I was about to question them, they preemptively answered. They must have understood that they would be seen as suspicious.

<b>

“What kind of special vehicle is it? It doesn’t seem like you’re riding in a carriage…”

“I think it’s faster to see it in person, would you like to see?”

“... Let’s see it then.”

<b>

There’s no way they rode on the back of a dragon. I thought that as I left the reception to accompany them outside.

<b>

“So, where is that vehicle?”

“This way. … Wake up!”

<b>

As the merchant woman cast the spell, the toy that was in her hand transformed into a giant cart.

No, is it really a cart? The shape is a bit strange. It looks like a barrel with a door on the side. There’s a window at the front. Only one wheel protruded.

<b>

<b>

“It’s a development tool lent to us by a great healer, and it can change size like this, making it convenient to carry.”

“Don’t you have any horses? You didn’t all take turns pulling it, did you?”

“This is a magical tool, so it runs by itself. It’s a bit dangerous, though.”

<b>

It runs by itself? Is there such a magical tool?

<b>

“It’s like a golem.”

“Oh, a golem, I see.”

<b>

When you think about it, golems also carry people inside and walk. It was similar.

<b>

… This is convenient. After all, it’s like a small hut; if you can rest inside, it greatly simplifies the hassle of setting up a tent and the night watch during camping.

Moreover, if it can run as it is, I can understand their cleanliness.

<b>

That leaves only the question of the travel time.

<b>

“So, is it really that fast?”

“Absolutely. However, it consumes a lot of magical stones for golems, so honestly, it doesn’t pay off.”

“... You’re a merchant, right? Why are you using something like that?”

“I borrowed it from the healer who lent it to us, along with the magical stones, to learn how to use it. I wouldn’t buy it myself.”

<b>

I see. If it’s not out of their own pocket, they wouldn’t mind using it.

<b>

“Can you show me it running in action?”

“Sure. But it’s dangerous if you’re not used to it, so I’ll ride it alone… please stand back. I’ll go to that big rock over there and come back.”

“Oh.”

<b>

The female merchant points to a rock that is quite far away.

It’s several hundred meters away.

<b>

“Alright, here I go!”

“Ah—”

<b>

Just as I was about to respond, the magical tool shot out faster than a seasoned mage’s fire lance. It reached the target rock at incredible speed, made a large turn, and returned at that speed— … wait, is it going to stop?! H-Hey!

<b>

As I braced myself, it skidded to a stop, leaving marks on the ground like a horse that had stopped abruptly.

So it does stop. Thank goodness.

<b>

“And that’s how it works. Once it fully gains speed, it gets even faster.”

“I see, I see. So that’s why it took five days.”

“Yes, yes. That’s correct, gatekeeper.”

<b>

In the blink of an eye, they covered that distance. If that’s the case, it would be easy to shake off monsters and take shortcuts slightly off the main road.

But five days…

<b>

“... If it’s that fast, it might sell well as an emergency messenger for the country, right?”

“Oh, no. This thing can kill you just by bumping into something. I’ve almost died several times, and it’s not ready for sale yet.”

“... You’ve managed to stay safe somehow.”

“If I get used to it, I think I can move even faster.”

<b>

Thinking about it, if they collided with a rock at that speed, it would be a disaster. For delivering messages, it would be safer for a tamer to send a bird.

When the female merchant shouted, “Shutdown!”, the magical tool shrank down. She picked it up and stored it in her backpack.

I see, the danger is great, but it seems convenient.

The danger is great, but.

<b>

“So, is there no problem?”

“Ah, well, there shouldn’t be any problems. I’ll check the other cargo as well.”

“Yes. There’s just honey left.”

“... Was that jar okay?”

“Eh?! Ah, yes, it was protected by magic. By the healer! Well, we were also protected, so it was fine. Otherwise, we would have died three times.”

<b>

That healer, who is also a magical tool craftsman, seems to be an incredible mage.

No, if they couldn’t do that much, they would probably lose their life while creating such magical tools. Yeah.

<b>

Thus, I was shown a rare vehicle. Since there were no issues with the other cargo, I issued the passage permit normally.

<b>

<b>

Today’s duties were completed safely.
