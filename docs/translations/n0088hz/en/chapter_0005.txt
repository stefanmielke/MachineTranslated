# Kamikete - God, please walk quickly without running and help me soon - (●Illustration included)

<b>

I am Karina! I came to the Kingdom of Solashidore from the Alchemy Kingdom aiming to become a merchant!

But since my hometown, the Alchemy Kingdom, has been destroyed, I have to make a living here, it's really tough!

I had my belongings stolen by a friend-like person from the Alchemy Kingdom along the way, so I have nothing!

<b>

<b>

"Wow... that sounds tough, if that's the truth, though."

<b>

After saying something like that, I am being suspiciously eyed.

Well, yeah. I just realized it now, but I am way too clean.

<b>

<b>

In this world, let's say I walked here from the Alchemy Kingdom, right?

And even though I said I was attacked, I'm not dirty at all.

<b>

Wow, that's suspicious.

<b>

"Um, actually, I flew here using magic."

<b>

It's not like it's spatial magic, but flying with magic is not impossible.

However, when I tell the truth to a certain extent without lying...

<b>

"Oh? You were a magician? Then why were your belongings stolen?"

"I was just waking up, and, um, I just took what I could?"

"A person aiming to be a merchant, huh?"

<b>

Waaah, they're really pressing me hard!

Well, the soldier is just doing their job! Damn, if I had known this, I should have teleported directly into the town instead of entering through the gate!

<b>

<b>

After that, when I showed that I could read, write, and do arithmetic as proof of being a merchant, I was suspected of being a spy. But is there really such a foolish spy? They defended me.

Furthermore, they said I might be a decoy and increased the security... Ahhhhh! God, help me! Your apostle is in trouble!

<b>

"Hmm? Did you just call for me? I felt a desperate prayer."

"God!?"

<b>

The voice of God. When I looked at the soldier, they had stopped.

It seems that time has stopped.

<b>

"Is this... time stop!?"

"Yes, I'm a god of time and space. I'm currently stopping the time in this room. It's a relief that there are no dogs around, as this magic can't stop dogs."

<b>

Why only dogs???

<b>

"Also, time-related skills are forbidden arts, so I haven't given them to you. If you want to learn, you'll have to do it on your own."

<b>

God said that so casually.

So I can learn it, huh? Even though it's forbidden.

<b>

"Well, I can help you, but you owe me one. Please make an offering to the church next time."

"Y-yes! Ah, but if possible, I'd like the resolution or offering to be done peacefully..."

"What do you think I am... I won't recklessly kill people."

<b>

I thought you might be a god of destruction or something.

<b>

"I've put your identification in a storage space. Showing that will solve your problem."

"Ah, thank you! I will definitely deliver the offering!"

"Then, 3, 2, 1..."

<b>

With God's countdown, the stopped time begins to move again.

<b>

"Oh! I'm sorry, I had my identification!"

"Hmm? I thought you said you lost it?"

"Um, I had hidden it in the back of the fabric of my clothes—here it is."

<b>

Saying that, I opened the storage space in my pocket and took out the identification I received from God.

It was a medal slightly larger than a 500 yen coin. There was a hole in the center.

When I handed the identification to the soldier, they stared at it intently.

<b>

"...This is... I see."

<b>

The soldier's attitude clearly changed. Their tough face softened.

<b>

"Well, no problem. You can pass. Honestly, you should have shown this from the start."

"Ah, yes. Thank you very much."

<b>

Wow, God's identification. I managed to pass without really understanding what happened.

Then, I looked again at the medal of the identification returned by the soldier.

<b>

...It was a large 5 yen coin.

<b>

Huh? Is a 5 yen coin a form of identification in another world? Just as I thought that, I heard God's voice in my head.

<b>

"This is an item that hypnotizes people into thinking 'this is a proper identification.' If you use it too much, its effect will diminish, so it's better not to overuse it."

<b>

Um. Is God actually a bad god?

I thought that but decided not to voice it since I was saved.

<b>

"Also, for the offering, please provide a beautiful woman's socks, but not yours."

"...Why beautiful woman's socks? Um, wasn't God a goddess?"

"It's a hobby. Well then, bye."

<b>

God really has some strange hobbies...
