# Kamikete - God, never run, hurry up and walk and save me quickly (● Illustrations)

<blank>

My name is Karina!　I came from the Kingdom of Alchemy to the Kingdom of Pavelkant and Solacidore to become a merchant!

But my hometown, the Alchemy Kingdom, has been destroyed, so I have to make a living here!

I don't have any luggage because my friend Modoki of the Alchemy Kingdom stole it from me on the way!

<blank>

<blank>

'Oh wow ...... tough luck, if only that were true.'

<blank>

I told him something like that, and he was suspicious to the hilt.

Oh, no. I just realized that I'm too clean.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Let's say you came from the Alchemy Kingdom to this town on foot, right?

And even though he says he was attacked, he's not dirty at all.

<blank>

Wow, suspicious.

<blank>

...... uh, actually flew in by magic."

<blank>

It's not as good as spatial magic, but it's not impossible to fly with magic.

But when you tell the truth to the extent that it's not a lie like this: ......

<blank>

Ho?　You were a wizard. So how did they get your stuff?"

I'm up in bed, and, well, what do you take for the time being?

"A would-be merchant, huh?"

<blank>

Wow, I'm going to get poked and prodded!

That's the job of soldiers, isn't it?　Damn it, we should have moved directly into the town instead of entering through the gate!

<blank>

<blank>

Later, when he showed that he could read, write, and do arithmetic to prove that he was a merchant, he was now suspected of spying. But who could be such a dumb spy?　He is defended by the "Who would be such a stupid spy?

And it's even more important that I might be a diversion and replenish security or something. ...... ahhhhh!　God help me!　Your apostle is in trouble!

<blank>

Hmm?　Did you just call me?　I felt an earnest prayer.

God!

<blank>

God's voice. I looked at the soldier with a huff and he stopped.

Apparently, time stands still.

<blank>

This is a ...... time stop!"

I'm a space-time god. I only stop time in this room now. Thank goodness there are no dogs in the room, because this magic has a restriction that dogs can't be stopped.

<blank>

Why only dogs?

<blank>

I don't give you time-based skills because they are forbidden. If you want to learn it, you are on your own.

<blank>

God says so simply.

So it can be remembered. It's a forbidden art.

<blank>

'So, I can help you, but you owe me one. Next time, please offer a tribute to the church.'

Ha, yes!　Oh, but if possible, we'll try to keep the resolution or tribute in a moderate way: ......"

'What do you think I am? ...... I don't kill people without a second thought.'

<blank>

I thought he was the God of Destruction or something.

<blank>

I put my ID card in the storage space. If you show it to me, it will solve the problem.

Oh, thank you."　We will definitely deliver the tribute!"

Then three, two, one. ......

<blank>

With God's countdown, time that had stood still begins to move.

<blank>

Oh!　Sorry, I found your ID!"

"Hmm?　I thought you said you lost it?"

Well, there's one that I hid behind the fabric of my clothes--here it is.

<blank>

Saying this, he opens the storage space in his pocket and takes out the ID card God gave him.

It was a medal slightly larger than a 500-yen coin. It had a hole in the center.

I hand my ID card to the soldier and look at it seriously.

<blank>

"...... this is ...... I see."

<blank>

The soldier's demeanor clearly changed. His stern face softened.

<blank>

Mm, no problem. You can go ahead. You can start at the beginning with this."

Oh, yes. Thank you."

<blank>

Wow, God's ID card. I got through before I knew better.

And I look again at the ID medal returned to me by the soldier.

<blank>

It was a large five-yen coin the size of .......

<blank>

What, in another world, a five-yen coin is an ID card?　When I thought that, I heard God's voice in my brain.

<blank>

It is an item that uses hypnosis to make people think, "This is a proper identification. It is best not to use it too often, as it will lose its effectiveness."

<blank>

Um. Could God actually be an evil god?

But I decided not to mention it because it helped.

<blank>

And I'd like my tribute to be a pair of socks from a beautiful woman, but not from you."

"......Why the socks of a beautiful woman?　Um, God was a goddess, right?"

It's a hobby. Well then, noshi."

<blank>

God must have some weird taste. ......
