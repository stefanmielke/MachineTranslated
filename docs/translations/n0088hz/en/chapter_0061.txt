# After an All-Nighter

<b>

The heights of magical tools are endless.

<b>

But if I really put in the effort, it seems like I could somehow read it. Does this mean I've somehow learned the skill to create magical tools? Wow, I'm a genius! Thanks to the gods, of course.

<b>

"Hey, Dia, do you want to try making something too? Although, since we don't have any tools, if you could draw a magic circle on the parchment, I could paint it onto the wood."

"I'd like to try!"

"Alright! We have unlimited access to parchment, ink, and pens at the pirate's house."

<b>

Since we're just using it for fun, it's fine to make copies, right?

<b>

With that, we lost track of time and immersed ourselves in creating magical tools.

"Karina Onee-san, next this one, please!"

"Oh, what's this? Was this in the magic circle textbook?"

"I combined and arranged multiple magic circles. I think the light will swirl around on top of the magic circle!"

"Awesome! Dia, you're a genius! Let's output it right away! … Huh, it's not moving."

"Ah! I'm sorry, the lines were connected here… what a failure."

"Then I'll just fix that part. A little bit… it moved! The light is swirling around!"

"We did it!"

<b>

We hugged tightly in celebration of our successful experiment. Right after, Dia-kun blushed and pulled away, saying, "Ah, s-sorry, Onee-san, I just…" It's fine! Dia-kun is cute!

<b>

"But just swirling light isn't really useful, you know."

"No, no. If we use it well, we could make a clock or something, right? By adjusting the rotation speed."

"I see. But if we're making a clock, the cost of the magic stone is a problem… ah."

"Huh?"

"… O-Onee-san! By the way, is it okay to meet with my sister at this time!?"

<b>

Huh!? When I looked outside the storage space, it was already past noon.

… We've been up all night and it's already daytime!!

It's not just morning; it's lunchtime!!

<b>

Well, we didn't specifically say what time to go, so it should be fine, right? Oh no.

<b>

"I-I'll hurry, Dia-kun! I think your sister has probably already arrived!"

"Yes, but, Onee-san, you have ink on your face!"

"You have ink on your hands and face too, Dia-kun! Alright, ink removal magic, activate!!"

<b>

After spending all night producing and removing ink, I can now specifically target just the ink! Hahaha!

<b>

"Alright! Let's go!"

"Yes!"

<b>

Dia-kun took my outstretched hand.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Using optical camouflage, we suddenly appeared in front of the lord's castle. I remembered what Maria-baa said about coming from the front!

<b>

"Excuse me! I am the one who had an appointment with Maria-baa—no, the former lord's wife!"

"Huh? Who are you—ah! I-I apologize, I've heard about you. Someone will come to guide you right away!"

"Okay!"

<b>

… Phew, it seems we made it in time, and Maria-baa had properly informed the gatekeeper.

<b>

"I almost left my sister behind…"

"Yeah, it was so much fun that I got a bit carried away."

<b>

We laughed together, me and Dia-kun. It must have been quite frustrating for Dia-kun's sister to be left hanging, but well, forgive us.

<b>

"By the way, I still have some ideas I want to try—"

"Oh. Then I also found a magic circle through analyzing a golem—"

<b>

As we were deep in conversation, an older lady from Offuro Friends came to guide us.

<b>

"Karichan! I was worried you weren't coming!"

"Ahaha, sorry, Oba-chan. I got caught up in playing and stayed up all night, and just realized and rushed over. Now, let's hurry to see your sister!"

"… Seriously, take it easy. Huh? Is that child also an elf? … Well, if they're with Karichan, I have no reason to refuse. This way, please."

<b>

Huh? Isn't Dia-kun the main focus this time? When I looked at Dia-kun again, I realized he was still in a dress.

They haven't noticed Dia-kun yet, and Dia-kun seems to have forgotten he was wearing a dress.

<b>

My plan was to have Dia-kun warm my socks until just before we got here, and then to embarrass him by forcibly taking them off to collect them…

<b>

… But this is too interesting, so I'll keep quiet about it!! (After an all-nighter)
