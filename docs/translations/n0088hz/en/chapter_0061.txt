# All night long

<blank>

The heights of magical tools are endless.

<blank>

But if I work very hard, I can kind of read it. Is this like I've learned the skill to create magical tools?　I'm a genius. Thanks to God.

<blank>

I don't have any tools, so you can draw a magic circle on a piece of parchment and I'll draw it on the tree.　But I don't have any tools, so if you draw a magic circle on a piece of parchment, I'll draw it on the tree.

I'd love to do it!"

I've got parchment, ink, and pens at the pirate's house. Parchment, ink, and pens are at the pirate's house, so I can use them all I want."

<blank>

I just consume it to play, so I can duplicate it!

<blank>

And so we lost track of time and immersed ourselves in making magical tools.

Sister Karina, next this, next that, please!"

I said, "Oh, what's this? Was this in the magic book?"

I arranged it by combining multiple magic circles. With this, I think the light will spin around on the magic circle!"

I'm so proud of you," he said!　Dear genius!　I'll get the output as soon as I can! ......, it's not working."

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　I'm sorry, the lines here are connected. ...... failure."

I'll fix that part then. I moved ...... a little bit!　The light is spinning!

Yay!"

<blank>

We hugged each other tightly after the success of the experiment. Immediately after that, Dia-kun turns red with embarrassment and leaves, saying, "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's okay!　You're so cute, Dia-kun!

<blank>

But it doesn't help if it just glows and spins."

No, no, no. If you use it well, you can make a clock or something, can't you?　You could adjust the speed at which it spins."

I see. But if you want to make it into a clock, the cost of the magic stone is a bottleneck. ......

Hmm?"

"...... Oh, sister!　Speaking of which, is it safe to say that I have time to meet with my sister!"

<blank>

Ha!　I looked outside the storage space and saw that it was past noon outside.

...... You've been up all night and now you're up all night!

It's not morning, it's noon!

<blank>

And I didn't say specifically what time I was going to be there, okay, it's okay, right?　Aww.

<blank>

I'm in a hurry, Deere!　I think your sister's probably here by now!"

Yes," she said, "you have ink on your face!"

Deer, you have ink on your hands and face, too!　Eeeeee, activate the ink-removal magic all together!

<blank>

I've been inking and outking all night, and now I can target and erase ink only!　Wahaha!

<blank>

Okay!　Then I'm going!"

Yes!"

<blank>

Dia you took my proffered hand.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

While using optical camouflage, I walk out in front of the lord's castle with a splash. Grandma Maria told me to come to the front next time, I remembered correctly!

<blank>

I'm sorry!　I'm not Old Maria, I'm the one who was promised to the former Lord's wife!"

Hmm?　What's the matter with you?　I'm sorry, we've heard what you said. Someone will be with you shortly!"

Yes."

<blank>

......Whew, it looks like I made it in time and Old Maria made sure to talk to the gatekeeper.

<blank>

"You almost left my sister in the dust. ......

I was having so much fun that I got carried away.

<blank>

Me and Dia-kun laughing at each other. I know it must have been unbearable for Deer-kun's sister, who almost left me alone, but I forgive her.

<blank>

By the way, I still have some ideas I'd like to try--"

"Oh. Then I also found a magic circle in the golem analysis..."

<blank>

As I was talking with her, an old lady from Offro Friends came to guide me.

<blank>

Kari!　I was afraid you wouldn't come!"

I was playing around a bit and stayed up all night. I was playing around a bit and stayed up all night, and I just realized it a few minutes ago and hurried here. Now, let's hurry up and go see your sister!

"...... Don't go too far at all. Hmm?　I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. ...... Well, if she's with Kari, there's no reason to refuse her. Come on, this way.

<blank>

Hmm?　I thought that the main thing this time was this Dear-kun ......, and when I looked at Dear-kun again, I found that, come to think of it, she was still in one piece.

This is Deer-kun, and he doesn't even realize it, and Deer-kun forgets he's in one piece, too, doesn't he?

<blank>

The plan I had in mind was to have Dear warm my socks just before I got here and then collect them while embarrassing me by forcing me to take them off. ......

<blank>

...... funny, I'll shut up! (all-nighter)
