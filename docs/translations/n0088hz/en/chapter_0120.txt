# I've never worn them!

<blank>

I'm Karina!　Masilo, the beastie adventurer I saved, cool and cool, it was my fault she got into a pinch, I'm sorry!

So I compensated the damage. I did my best. Hehehe, if it's up to the great wizard Karina-chan, this is no big deal, right?

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, I did. I got on too bad, I'm sorry, okay?

<blank>

Masirosan made a fuss, "I don't know what's going on! I watched him for a while, but he got tired of the noise and lay down on the ground, gasping for air.

Monsters were attracted by the commotion, but they ran away when they saw the carcass of Black Mantis. This looks like a good insect repellent.

<blank>

"...... and. Tell me what you're after."

<blank>

Hmm?　Did you just say anything? You didn't say ....... Oh well.

<blank>

Then do me a favor.

I said, "Damn it, damn it!　I knew it! What the hell do you want?

I need a pair of Mr. Masillo's socks. ......

Socks? I've never worn ...... socks."

I know. I'm not wearing them, am I?"

<blank>

The fluffy silver wolf girl is a chemist's delight, but she has a strong field spirit, and her shoes were also sandals. Her thick body hair serves as socks, so she probably doesn't even need to wear them.

<blank>

...... hmm?　No, wait. Let's reverse the idea.

<blank>

I wonder if the fact that it's the beastie's first sock doesn't make it more valuable in reverse?"

What's it worth?　I don't know what you're talking about."

Yeah, I don't really know either."

<blank>

Whatever it is, it's the sock-loving God's fault.

<blank>

So, what else?"

Huh?"

Since there's no socks, there must be something else, you demand!

<blank>

They say it half-heartedly. But what is it? Like they're scared of me defeating Black Mantis?　I feel that kind of air. I hate to say it, but he's kind of cute, like a puppy.

<blank>

'Ummm ...... maybe shave your legs and have them made into socks?'

'What's that, gross!　Why are you so obsessed with socks!"

I know, I don't get it either. My boss likes socks.

I'm not sure if you're a courtesan or not. ...... ah, yes, I know, I don't understand how nobles think."

<blank>

Hmmm, is it also a palace service to serve God? ...... palace originally means temple, so it's not a mistake.

Anyway, Masilo's attitude suddenly softened. I wonder if this is also thanks to God.

<blank>

So was the hunt for Trent at the behest of the brass or something else?"

What?　No, I just didn't know. I'm sorry for bothering you. Do you want me to make you a spare sword?"

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　That's enough!"

<blank>

What a humble wolf. Cute, huh?

<blank>

I don't have a choice. I'll call on someone I know who wears socks and collect them. How about that?

I'll give you a new pair of socks. Can you give me the hairs on the soles of Mr. Masiello's feet, too, as long as I can pull them out without difficulty, and I want the parts that don't smell too bad.

I don't get it. ...... is fine and dandy, but what's the use?"

I'll deliver it anyway. Maybe they'll make tea."

"Wow, you creeped me out. ...... I'll give it to you, but only this time!"

<blank>

With that said, Masilo took off his sandals and brushed his feet and plucked out some of the hairs that had fallen out, as well as some hairs in the spaces between his paw pads.

<blank>

"Meatballs: ......!　Echidachi......"

What about?　What, the meatballs?"

<blank>

Oops, my voice leaked out unintentionally. No, because it's a big, very well-shaped paw paw paw!　It's a rare paw paw paw, so rare that in a previous life it could have been a bear, a tiger, or a lion!

<blank>

"Not only is your boss different, but you're different too. ......

<blank>

Oh, I feel like I've been pulled a little bit.

That's absurd. Isn't it one of the basic human desires to fluff up an animal or to squeeze its paw pads?　You see, out of the three basic desires, all but the desire for sleep are, so to speak, carnal desires. This is the meat of the meatballs. In other words--

<blank>

No, I'm sorry. I'm kidding. You know?

<blank>

And here are some new socks. We have a few different sizes, but if we run out, we'll make up for it later. You should wear them, too, Mashiro. And the next time we meet, let me collect them, okay?"

"...... Oh, wow. You even have a replacement? You're too serious."

I'm not joking, I'm serious. I can't help it."

<blank>

And by the way, I got the foot hairs, but I'll have Mr. Masilo keep his socks on until the next time I see him.

What, the hairs stand up against each other and it's disgusting?　...... Sorry, I don't know how to wear socks for beast people or something.
