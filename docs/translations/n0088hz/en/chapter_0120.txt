# I've never worn something like that

<b>

I'm Karina! The beastman adventurer Mashiro, whom I saved, got into a pinch because of me, sorry!

So I compensated for the damages. With all my might. Hehe, for a great magician like me, this is a piece of cake, right?

<b>

<b>

Yes. I got carried away, sorry?

<b>

Mashiro was making a fuss saying, "I don't get it at all!" and was so cute that I watched for a while, but maybe she got tired of the commotion and lay down on the ground, panting.

By the way, monsters were drawn to the commotion, but they ran away upon seeing the corpse of the Black Mantis. This seems like a good insect repellent.

<b>

"…So. What's your aim? Tell me."

<b>

Huh? What did you just say? …You didn't say anything. Well, whatever.

<b>

"Then I have one request."

"What the hell! I knew it, what's your aim!?"

"I want Mashiro's socks…"

"Socks? …I've never worn something like that."

"Right? You haven't worn them."

<b>

She's a fluffy silver wolf girl that makes kemono fans rejoice, but that also means she's quite wild, and her footwear was sandals. Her thick body fur probably serves the purpose of socks, so there’s no need to wear any.

<b>

…Huh? No, wait. Let's reverse the idea.

<b>

"How about the value increases if it's the beastman's first socks?"

"What value!? I have no idea what you're talking about!"

"Yeah, I don't really get it either."

<b>

It's all the fault of the sock-loving god.

<b>

"So, what else?"

"Huh?"

"Since you don't have socks, there must be something else you want!"

<b>

She said that half-annoyed. But what is it? It feels like she's scared of me after defeating the Black Mantis? I sense that kind of atmosphere. I don't mean to say it, but it's kind of cute like a puppy.

<b>

"Hmm… how about shaving my foot fur and making socks out of it?"

"What the hell is that, gross!? Why are you so fixated on socks?!"

"Yeah, right? I don't get it either. My boss loves socks."

"Are you in service? …Ah, yeah, I guess the thoughts of nobles are incomprehensible."

<b>

Hmm, is serving the god also considered service? …The term "palace" originally means a temple, so it's not wrong.

Anyway, Mashiro's attitude suddenly softened. I wonder if this is thanks to the god.

<b>

"So, was hunting the treant also an order from some important person?"

"Huh? No, I just didn't know. Sorry for causing trouble. Oh, should I make a spare sword?"

"That's fine, that's fine! Just stop already!"

<b>

What a humble wolf. So cute.

<b>

"Geez, what a pain. Then I'll ask someone I know who wears socks and collect them for you. How about that?"

"Oh, I'll give you new socks. Can I also get some of the fur from the soles of Mashiro's feet, in a way that can be pulled out without too much effort, and preferably from the smelly parts?"

"I don't get it at all… but whatever, what are you going to use it for?"

"For now, I'll just try to deliver it. Probably for some tea or something."

"Ugh, that gave me the creeps… I'll give it to you, but only this time!"

<b>

Saying that, Mashiro took off her sandals and plucked a few hairs from her feet and between her paw pads.

<b>

"Paw pads…! So lewd…"

"Huh? What, the paw pads?"

<b>

Oops, I accidentally let that slip. I mean, they’re such nicely shaped, big paw pads!? In my previous life, they’d be considered rare, like those of a bear, tiger, or lion!

<b>

"Not just your boss, but you're weird too…"

<b>

Ah, I feel like I might have been a bit put off.

That’s ridiculous. Wanting to pet animals or squish their paw pads is one of human's basic desires, right? You know, aside from the desire for sleep, the other two of the three basic desires are basically desires for flesh. This is the flesh of the paw pads. So—

<b>

No, sorry, I’m just kidding. Really.

<b>

"Also, here are the new socks. I have several sizes prepared, but if they’re not enough, I’ll supplement later. And Mashiro, make sure to wear them. Then let me collect them next time we meet, okay?"

"…O-okay. You even prepared replacements. You're too serious about this."

"I'm not joking, it's for real. It can't be helped."

<b>

I got the foot fur, but I also want Mashiro to wear socks until we meet again.

Huh, the fur standing up makes it feel weird? …Sorry, I don’t know how to wear socks for beastmen.
