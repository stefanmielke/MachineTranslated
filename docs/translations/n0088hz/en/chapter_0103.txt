# Hi glad to hear it!

<blank>

I'm Karina!

I woke up the next day with my dwarf sisters (one half) on my right and left.

All three of them were dressed in their undies. Oh, Dear, you were not there. Safe?

<blank>

No, well, the story of how this happened is simple.

As soon as I got back from the dungeon, he said to me, "Let's sleep with crunchy today, and we'll have a drink together at the launch. I did. I had an original appointment.

<blank>

As for Dia, I said, "Well, it's a girls' night out for everyone! I said, "Oh, I'm a guy, so I'll refrain from doing that! I'm a guy, so I'll pass! I don't understand. Saty-tan seemed to have no idea which one was the guy.

<blank>

Ugh, and then it happened, another waste of ...... memory due to alcohol!　Damn!

But I tried too!　And yet, the moment I tried to fool her with spatial magic, Sati said, "What is it?　What are you up to?　Are you trying to cheat me out of my drink? I was forced to drink it, or rather, I wondered how she knew!

<blank>

What, "I can tell by your crunchy face"?

Oh, no!　Sati-tan likes me too much!　I love you!

<blank>

Well, I had a drink with Sati and Isiah and started to eat ...... Crowler's dried meat was surprisingly addictive and I might have eaten too much of it. I'm amazed that after being dried in the sun and then soaked in water for 10 minutes, the meat returns to its original plump texture. I wonder if this creature was actually created for preserving food.

...... Well, what happened from there...... Well, anyway, it is a small character, not a river character. I gently stroke the two adorable angels on either side of me. They have red hair just like me, and they are very close to each other. Ahhh, I'm so happy.

I said, "Huh. ...... Hey, crunchy good morning. You were awake?"

I just woke up. I love you, Sati-tan. ......!"

Me too, mmm.

<blank>

Sati-tan rubs her head against my chest. Haha that tickles and feels so good.

<blank>

"Dear Master, I adore you... ......"

The first thing to do is to take a look at the "Aixia Oha, no, she's still sleeping, right? I'm still sleeping....

"Oh, that sounds like fun."

<blank>

Saying so, Sati-tan also started tickling my armpits. I'm weak in the armpits and armpits, ahiyee. Wake up, ayesir.

<blank>

"Huh, I was dreaming of eating some kind of pickle, Aruji-sama's pickle. ...... My mouth tasted slightly sour. ......!"

Oh, oh, good morning. ......

Good morning, Mister.

<blank>

What's with my pickles? You mean my homemade pickles?　Or is it a cryptic term?　If you're saying you used to eat me as a pickle, that's a little scary, don't you think?

<blank>

"It was a pleasure to have that ...... favor last night. ......!

Oh, my sister Ai has a female face."

I'm just jealous that you got to try it before me!　I'm only jealous because you ate it before me!　Oh, but you sucked on my feet like that. Did you really enjoy my feet and Sati's so much?"

<blank>

Ah. Yup. I guess I guessed it when I got into this state, but I guess I ate Isiah too. ...... In a sexual way, of course. I don't know why I don't remember. I'm not sure why I don't remember!

<blank>

'The booze isn't bad, okay?　Crunchy. Right?"

"Yes!　It's not my fault!

<blank>

Sati-tan's killing spirit. You read my mind!　How well you understand me, I love you!

<blank>

Sati, if you get too carried away, you may find that even if the Uncle forgives you, I may not?"

Hmmm?"　What do you mean if you don't forgive me? You think that Ai's sister, a crunchy slave, would harm me, a crunchy lover?　Come on, come on, what are you doing?

I'm going to reveal a childhood secret. Dear Uncle, have you ever wondered how old Sati was when she used to wet the bed?"

I'm sorry.

<blank>

Haha, close sisters. And me being sandwiched between them. I'm so happy.
