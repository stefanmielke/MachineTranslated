# Hi, I'm happy to be here!

<b>

I'm Karina-chan!

The next day, when I woke up, I found myself flanked by dwarf sisters (one of them is a half-dwarf).

All three of us were in revealing underwear. Oh, and Dia-kun wasn't there. Safe?

<b>

<b>

Well, the reason for this situation is quite simple.

Right after returning from the dungeon, I was told, "So today, let's sleep together, Karikari, and have a drinking party!" and I ended up saying, "Hi, I'm happy to be here!" after all. There was also the original promise.

<b>

As for Dia-kun, when I said, "Well then, today it's a girls' gathering!" he replied, "Oh, I'm a boy, so I'll pass!" and left. I don't understand. And Sati-tan seemed to not realize which one he was and said, "Oh, so you were a boy."

<b>

<b>

Ugh, still, I messed up, my memories are fading again because of the alcohol... what a waste! Damn it!

But I tried my best too, you know!? Yet the moment I tried to use spatial magic to cover it up, Sati-tan glared at me and said, "Hey? Are you plotting something? Trying to sneak my alcohol?" and I had no choice but to drink it, wondering how she figured it out!

<b>

What, "You can tell just by looking at Karikari's face"?

Geez! Sati-tan, don't you like me too much!? I like you!

<b>

Well, with that, I started drinking with Sati-tan and Aishia... The dried meat from the crawler had an unexpectedly addictive taste, and I might have eaten too much. It's amazing how it returns to a plump texture after soaking in water for 10 minutes. Did the crawler actually evolve as a preserved food?

...Hmm, what happened after that... Anyway, we were lying in a small line. I gently stroked the two adorable angel girls beside me. They had similar red hair and felt nice to touch. Ahh, so happy.

<b>

"Yawn... Oh, Karikari, good morning. You were awake?"

"Mm, just woke up. I love you, Sati-tan...!"

"I love you too, mm..."

<b>

Sati-tan rubbed her head against my chest. Ahahaha, it tickles and feels good.

<b>

"Master, I adore you..."

"Oh, Aishia, good—no, you're still asleep. Hey, don't kiss my armpit, ahh!"

"Oh, you all look like you're having fun."

<b>

Sati-tan then started tickling my sides. My sides and armpits are weak, ahh! Wake up, Aishia!

<b>

"Ah, I was dreaming about eating your pickles, Master... My mouth has a slight sour taste...!"

"O-oh, good morning..."

"Good morning, Master!"

<b>

What do you mean by my pickles? Are you saying I made them? Or is it a euphemism? If you were pickling me and eating me, that sounds a bit scary?

<b>

"Last night, I was... so happy to receive your affection...!"

"Oh, Aishia has a feminine look."

"Shut up, Sati! You're just jealous because I was eaten by Master first! Ah, but Master, you were nibbling on my and Sati's legs so much. Were they that delicious?"

<b>

Ah, yeah. I had a feeling this would happen, but Aishia also got eaten... of course, in a sexual sense. Damn it, why can't I remember? It's all the alcohol's fault!

<b>

"Alcohol isn't to blame, right? Karikari. Right?"

"Y-yes! It’s not bad at all!"

<b>

Sati-tan's killing intent. She read my mind! How much does she understand me? I love it!

<b>

"Sati, if you get too carried away, even if Master forgives you, I might not."

"Hmm? If you won't forgive me, what will you do? Aishia, Karikari's slave, would harm me, Karikari's lover? Come on, what will you do?"

"I'll expose a childhood secret. Master, aren't you curious how long Sati wet the bed?"

"I'm sorry!"

<b>

Ahaha, the friendly sisters. And I'm sandwiched between them. So happy.
