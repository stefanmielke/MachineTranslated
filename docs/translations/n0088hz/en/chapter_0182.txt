# Reflection Meeting with Grandma Maria

<b>

By the way, since I can make potions with my meat, I wonder if I can make potions from the king's stomach cancer.

Well, I won't make them though.

<b>

So, it's the reflection meeting with Grandma Maria. I've been invited to another tea party, so I'm going.

<b>

"......"

"I'm sorry. Was it bad to heal him without permission?"

"No, that's fine. But, um... is it really fine? Hmm..."

<b>

Haaah, Grandma Maria lets out a big sigh.

If you keep sighing like that, happiness will escape, you know?

<b>

"Well, King was very grateful."

"I see. Health is precious, isn't it? Though you don't realize it when you're healthy."

"That's right. But you see, the king's illness was a terminal disease that recovery magic couldn't cure."

<b>

Huh? Is that so...? Ah, it was cancer.

If you try to promote recovery against cancer cells, it might actually worsen the condition. That's probably why the symptoms were progressing locally despite no metastasis.

<b>

"The prince of our country might resent it, though."

"Someone's misfortune is someone else's happiness, huh?"

"Yeah. Especially in a position like the king's. But well, thanks to that, it seems the king has regained his composure."

<b>

According to him, the king was afflicted with a terminal illness—one that recovery magic and regeneration magic couldn't heal—and he planned this theft to use his remaining life to save the world.

Well, I healed him though.

<b>

By the way, does the Pavalkant Kingdom not have any other divine artifacts to offer? At least, it seems there were none within the king's awareness.

Even if there were, perhaps they are too closely tied to daily life, like the dungeon core, making them inaccessible.

<b>

In any case, the king probably won't commit theft of divine artifacts in the future.

……

<b>

"By the way, Grandma Maria. Let's keep this matter a secret from Dia-kun and Kumin-san."

"Ah... We have no benefit in spreading the news of the king's rampage to other countries. That's fine."

<b>

I'm glad. This way, Dia-kun won't find out that I inadvertently caused a match pump.

If he were to find out, I'd probably end up burying my face in the futon and writhing for a day.

<b>

"But if that kid figures it out on his own, that's beyond our jurisdiction."

"...... Dia-kun is smart, so he might have noticed."

<b>

And there's a possibility that he is silently understanding.

...No, it must be so, because he hasn't asked who the mastermind behind the Phantom Thief Hermes was.

<b>

He must have inferred it from the fact that I forgot to retrieve the fake divine artifact and locked myself in my room. Dia-kun is so smart!!

<b>

"Ahhh, what kind of face should I make when I meet Dia-kun?"

"Honestly confessing might actually make you feel better. You brought this upon yourself."

"Grandma Maria's profound and valuable words have struck me directly. Guhuh."

<b>

Please stop, the logic punch hits me hard.

<b>

"Still, I never thought Kalli-chan could cure a terminal illness. You should have told me beforehand."

"I'm sorry. I touched him thinking I could relieve the king's shoulder pain, and it turned out to be an illness, and it seemed quite easy to cure, so I just did it a bit?"

"Easy!? What would happen if the church found out about that...?"

"Eh, the church is a friend, though?"

<b>

Sister Siesta, who is in every town, is my colleague.

In fact, we even had sweets together the other day.

<b>

"Then is it not a problem...? But if it became known that you could cure that terminal illness, it would definitely lead to trouble. You should keep that well hidden, okay? You want to live peacefully, right?"

"Y-yeah. Well, that's true."

"Speaking of living peacefully, how do you explain being the local wife of the queen of Tesshin...?"

"Ah, hey, hey, let me give Grandma Maria a massage too. I'm going to touch your body."

"Ahhhhh... Wait, are you trying to distract me with this...? Zzz..."

<b>

Alright, she's asleep. Well, you worked hard, dear guest.

I've cleared up your shoulder and back pain, so when you wake up, you'll be full of energy.

<b>

Well then, since the tea party host has fallen asleep, I guess I'll head home.

<b>

"Well then, Auntie of the Bath Friends, I'll leave the rest to you!"

"Wait, Kalli-chan, please help me a little without falling asleep. It seems like a big deal."

"Eh?"

"Who do you think will carry the deeply sleeping Mariabelle-sama?"

"Well, I can't help it. Just a little bit then."

<b>

Thank you for your hard work, Auntie, as I gently pat her shoulder.

<b>

"Ahhhhh... Oh! My shoulders feel light! I've rejuvenated ten years! Thank you, Kalli-chan! As a reward, I'll give you some candy. Bring it here."

"Yay! Then see you later!"

<b>

I received candy from Auntie and quickly left the tea party.
