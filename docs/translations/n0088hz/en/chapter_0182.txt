# Reflections with Grandma Maria

<blank>

Well, since they can make potions with my meat, I wonder if they can make potions with the king's stomach cancer.

No, I won't make it.

<blank>

So, it's a reflection with Grandma Maria. I was invited to a tea party again, so I go.

<blank>

"......"

I'm sorry. Did I do something wrong?

'No, that's fine. That's fine. ...... No, it's not good?　Hmm."

<blank>

Hah," sighs Grandma Maria with a grand sigh.

Sighing like that will make you run away from happiness.

<blank>

Well, the King was very grateful.

I see. Thank goodness for good health, you never know when you're healthy."

Yes," he said, "but you know what? But you see, the king's illness was a deadly disease with no restorative magic."

<blank>

Hm?　I didn't know that. ...... Yeah, it was a cancer, wasn't it?

If you promote recovery toward the cancer cells, they are more likely to get worse. That's rather what it would mean if there were no metastasis but the symptoms were progressing locally.

<blank>

"Our princes and such might resent it, though."

Someone's misery is someone's happiness.

Oh. I'm not sure if it's a good idea. But, well, thanks to you, the King seems to have regained his composure.

<blank>

According to the story, the king is suffering from a deadly disease - a disease that makes recovery magic and defect recovery magic ineffective - and he planned this robbery in order to use his few remaining lives to save the world.

Well, I'm cured.

<blank>

I mean, doesn't the kingdom of Pavelkant have any other divine artifacts that it can offer up? At least not to the extent that the king was aware of.

Or if there is, it's too close to life, like dungeon core, that we can't get to it.

<blank>

Anyway, from now on, the king won't be stealing sacred objects or anything like that.

......

<blank>

By the way, Old Maria, please don't tell Dia and Mr. Cumin about this. By the way, Old Maria, please don't tell Mr. Dear or Ms. Cumin about this matter.

"Ah ...... over here, we have no interest in telling other countries about the king's outburst. Fine."

<blank>

Thank goodness, now you won't have to find out about my unintentional match-pumping from Mr. Deere.

If they were to find out, they would have to spend another day or so writhing around with their faces under the covers.

<blank>

But if she finds out on her own or something, she's out of our jurisdiction."

...... Dear, you're smart, you might have noticed."

<blank>

And it is possible that they have guessed and kept quiet.

...... No, absolutely not, because they never asked who was the mastermind behind Hermes the Phantom Thief.

<blank>

You must have guessed from where I came home and holed myself up in my room, forgetting that I had accidentally forgotten to get back the fake sacred objects. Dia, you are a clever one!

<blank>

'Ohhhh, what do I look like when I see you, Dear?'

I think it would be easier if I just told the truth. I deserved it."

I was so grateful for Old Maria's words that I decided to attack her directly. Gghh!"

<blank>

Don't do it, the righteous punch works on me.

<blank>

I didn't think you could cure a deadly disease, Kari," he said. You should have told me that beforehand."

I'm sorry. I was going to heal the king's stiff shoulder, but when I touched it, it turned out to be a disease, and it looked like it could be cured rather easily, so I just had to do a little something.

It's so easy!　What's going to happen if the church finds out about it? ......"

Yes, the church is your friend, but what?"

<blank>

Siesta, the sister in every town, and I are colleagues, you know.

We even ate sweets together the other day.

<blank>

Wouldn't that be a problem for you, ......?　No, but I bet it would be a big problem if people knew I could cure that deadly disease. You've got to keep that kind of thing well hidden, don't you?　You want peace and quiet, don't you?"

I'm not sure. Well, yeah."

I mean, he's all about "peace and quiet," and yet he's got the Queen of Tessin as his local wife?

I'm going to give Old Maria a massage. I'm going to touch your body.

"Ohhhhhh ......, you're trying to fool me with this ...... suyaa ......."

<blank>

Okay, I went to bed. Well, you were tired - a customer.

I have cured my stiff shoulders and back pain, so I am full of energy when I wake up.

<blank>

Well then, I've slept with the tea party host, so I'm going home.

<blank>

'Well then, bath frenzied old lady, I'll take care of the rest!

I'm like, "Wait, Kari, please do me a little favor so I don't fall asleep. It sounds like a great idea.

Eh?"

Who do you think is going to carry Lady Maryabelle off to sleep?"

I've got no choice. Just a little bit."

<blank>

I pat her on the shoulder and say, "Thanks for your hard work, Obaachan.

<blank>

'Ohhhhhh ...... oh!　My shoulders are light!　I feel 10 years younger. Thanks, Kari!　I'll give you a candy bar in return. Bring it to me."

I'll see you later!　See you later."

<blank>

I took the candy from Obaachan and quickly left the tea party.
