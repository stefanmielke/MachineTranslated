# The disguise was strong.

<b>

<b>

While Karina and the others were discussing the demon tribe and the next village chief in the square, the merchants had the mercenaries surround the village.

A scout sent to check on the village returned with a surprising report. The merchant called the scout into the tent and listened while sipping tea.

<b>

"There were some people gathered in the village square. There were three individuals wearing different designs of clothing, and it seemed they were talking. One was an elf, one was a human, and the last one was a cat beastman. This one seemed to be reluctant as it was being petted on its rear and tail, so it must be a slave."

<b>

And the dragon――was not seen by the scout.

To say that the scout had poor eyesight would be an understatement; Karina's disguise was strong. It was hidden with god-level optical camouflage so that the dragon could not be seen unless one entered the village square.

<b>

To see through this from outside the square would require divine-level reconnaissance.

<b>

"Hmm. There are three unexpected individuals, but it seems there is no problem. If we can silence them――if we can capture them alive, let's sell them to the slave trader. Now, as planned, once the village is surrounded, let's proceed with the hunt."

"Indeed. Now, I wonder how many horns we can harvest."

<b>

The mercenaries were told that as long as they did not break the horns or kill them, they could do whatever they wanted.

If they were to kill a demon, the penalty would be ten silver coins for a man (about 100,000 yen) and one gold coin for a woman (about 1,000,000 yen), so they would likely not kill them casually.

<b>

"I just thought of something, but if we make them slaves and breed them, wouldn't we be able to harvest horns endlessly?"

"If we put in too much effort, the costs will pile up. Besides, if we breed too many, the value will collapse, and we won't recoup our investment, so this amount is just right. …That said, I won't stop you from trying, so you could use two males and two females to experiment."

"Oh, so the males have to be demons too. If we end up with humans, it would be a waste. Really, those demi-humans are quite skilled at pretending to be human, which is troublesome."

<b>

While they were having such casual conversations, it seemed the village's encirclement was complete.

<b>

"Well then, it's time for the hunt. However, we will be mere spectators."

"It would be dangerous if they resist. Now, let's see how the mercenaries perform."

<b>

As the merchants took out their binoculars, they exited the tent. They stood on a high ground overlooking the village and prepared their binoculars. A literal high vantage point.

<b>

"…Hmm? The demon tribe seems to be armed."

"This might give the mercenaries a bit of trouble… Hmm?"

<b>

One of the mercenaries was capturing a demon. However, immediately afterward, the mercenary froze, and instead, he was captured. He was then taken into the square.

The mercenary brought into the square looked pale as he stared at an empty spot.

<b>

"…I have a bad feeling about this. Shall we head back today?"

"Indeed… Hm?"

<b>

With the merchant's intuition, the two decided to retreat. However, their legs wouldn't move.

Physically.

<b>

"W-What is this!? Huh!? M-My legs won't move!?"

"I-I can't move either! Oh no, something's happening…!?"

『Gyaoon♪』

<b>

From behind, a large animal's roar echoed.

They couldn't turn around, but somehow it felt female… And only its shadow was cast at the merchants' feet.

<b>

"「…D-Dragon…!？」"

<b>

Immediately afterward, a dragon's hand grabbed the merchant's body. The merchant fainted there.

Moreover, the claws of that hand were adorned with jewels, but it seemed he lost consciousness before he could see them.

This is a rare opportunity that won't come again unless it gets an anime adaptation, so I think those who haven't bought it should get it…!
