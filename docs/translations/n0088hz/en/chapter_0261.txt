# The simulacrum was strong.

While Karina and her friends were discussing the next village chief with the demon tribe in the plaza, the merchants had the mercenaries besieging the village.

The scout who had been sent to check on the village returns with a surprising report. The merchant calls the scout into his tent and listens to his story over a cup of tea.

<blank>

There was some sort of gathering in the village square. There were three people dressed in different designs, and they seemed to be talking. One was an elf, one was a man-tribe, and the last one was a cat-beastman, and this one was stroking his buttocks and tail and didn't seem to like it, but didn't disobey, so I guess he was a slave."

<blank>

And as for the dragon - it was not in the scouts' eyes.

The knothole, as it were, was a strong mimicry of Kalina's. It was hidden by a god-level optical camouflage so that the dragon could not be seen without going into the village square.

<blank>

It would be impossible to spot this from outside the square without divine-level reconnaissance.

<blank>

Hm. There are three unscheduled people, but they don't seem to be a problem. We will keep them quiet, and if we can capture them alive, we will send them to the slavers. Then, as soon as the siege of the village is completed as planned, let's go hunting.

I'm looking forward to seeing how many antlers we'll be able to harvest. Now, let's see how many antlers we can catch.

<blank>

I have told the mercenaries that they can do whatever they want as long as they don't break their horns and don't kill them.

If they were to kill a demon tribe, they would not kill them casually, since the penalty is 10 silver coins (about 100,000 Japanese yen) for a man and 1 gold coin (about 1 million yen) for a woman.

<blank>

'One thought occurred to me, if we enslave them and breed them, can't we catch all the horns we can?

If you put too much effort into it, the cost will be too high. If you increase the number too much, the price will collapse and you won't get your money back, so this is about right. Even though it is ......, we won't stop you from trying it, so you can try it with two males and two females each.

Oh, must the man also be a demon? If I give birth to a human, it will be a loss of impregnation. The subhumans are so good at pretending to be human that it's quite troublesome.

<blank>

While they were chatting like that, the siege of the village seemed to have ended.

<blank>

Then it's time to hunt. Though, we'll be on the high side."

It would be dangerous if they resist. Now, let's see what the mercenaries can do."

<blank>

And the merchants leave the tent, taking out their binoculars. Standing on a hill overlooking the village, they set up their binoculars. They are literally looking down from a height.

<blank>

"......?　It looks like a bunch of demons are arming themselves, though."

This might give the mercenaries a bit of a headache. ......mm?"

<blank>

One of the mercenaries was catching the demon tribe. But immediately afterwards, the mercenaries' movements harden and they are caught in the opposite direction. Then they are taken into the square.

The mercenary who was brought into the plaza looks at the empty space and has a blue face.

<blank>

I have a bad feeling about ....... Shall we go home today?"

"Right. ...... hmm?"

<blank>

And they decided to retreat based on a merchant's intuition. However, their legs would not move.

Physical.

<blank>

What is this?　Eh!　Oh, my legs aren't moving!"

I'm going to go to the "Wow, wow, me too!　Oh shit, they're doing something to me ......!"

"Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

Behind me, I heard the roar of a large animal.

I can't turn around, but I have a feeling it's a female somehow. ...... and only its shadow is reflected at the merchant's feet.

<blank>

"...... Dora, gon ......!"

<blank>

Immediately after, the dragon's hand grabbed his body. The merchant fainted there.

He had a jewel stuck under his fingernail, but he seemed to have fainted before he saw it.
