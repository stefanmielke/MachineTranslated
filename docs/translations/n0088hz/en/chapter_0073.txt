# I came to the slavers.

In addition, it seems that due to the arrival of refugees, information about the destruction of the alchemical kingdom is finally spreading to the general public.

<blank>

'Ugh. The Alchemy Kingdom, I've always wanted to go there. ...... I never thought it was destroyed."

<blank>

Dia-kun, who recently started and got into alchemy, was a little depressed when he heard the information that the alchemy kingdom, the sacred place of alchemy, was destroyed.

...... I guess there's no point in going there now and seeing a ruined town.

<blank>

And I'm sorry, it was our God who destroyed it.

The king of the Alchemical Kingdom would not have been destroyed if he had not claimed to be the God of Chaos!

Well, I wouldn't even be here if God hadn't tried to destroy the Alchemy Kingdom, so we'll just call it an offset, right?

So I left the seniors and the next day. I came to the slaver.

I knew I couldn't leave out slaves when it comes to otherworldly reincarnation. ......

<blank>

There are so many people. ...... says that these are almost all slaves of the products. There are too many of them to fit in the room, and their clothes are still the same as when they were sold, so they look like normal people. They were refugees, so they are a little dirty.

<blank>

And here's an explanation by Mr. Basic Knowledge after all these years.

Slavers are the last safety net to buy even criminals. They contribute to the maintenance of public safety by purchasing even those who would otherwise be thrown away to save their mouths, and they basically never refuse to buy them. It is said that the slavers are also connected to the government.

...... Well, the slavers of Velarde were also the children of the lords, weren't they? Yes, I know.

<blank>

This is probably why the refugees of the alchemy kingdom bought them as they were offered for sale, and the result is this overflowing crowd. They must be shipped to other towns in the future.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, then, it's time for your long-awaited shopping at the slavers' market.

<blank>

Excuse me.

Yes, yes, purchase?　Trade-in?　Or is it a purchase?"

I feel like I'm considering buying."

<blank>

When I said this, the slaver's face lit up.

<blank>

Welcome to our website!　Welcome to our store. As you can see, we have an overflowing inventory, so you are really welcome to buy. ...... Uh, we don't actually have many slaves for sale because we haven't fully educated them. But...!　If you educate them yourself, we will give you a discount!

By the way, how much did you charge?

Normally, an educated slave costs from one to a dozen gold coins, but we will deduct five large silver coins from that for a freshly arrived uneducated slave!　I recommend it. No, really.

<blank>

Oh, and the minimum is 50 silver coins. That's more than I can afford as Carina Shonin. Well, I will still have to borrow money from Dia, because the principal of the business will disappear.

<blank>

Sounds cheaper than I was prepared for."

It costs money just to take care of the slaves, and that cost is added to the price of the slaves. It is only natural that freshly arrived, untrained slaves are cheaper. ...... So, it's a bargain price just for now."

<blank>

If anything, the slavers would like to take back the uneducated slaves before they become a liability. If they can make even a small profit, all the better.

<blank>

<blank>

'But if an uneducated slave does something wrong, it is the master's fault, isn't it?　I've heard that some slaves have been known to trick their masters with it and then wait to be bought again."

Hahaha, that's a legendarily rare example. Normally, they would have been disposed of as bad inventory. Or, they were in cahoots with the slavers."

<blank>

The previous slaver, however, is not so now, so don't worry. The slaver chuckled.

Senior, now you've threatened me, haven't you?　Well, it would have been better if you had said it that strongly so that I would be more careful.

<blank>

Worst case scenario, if I don't let the slaves out of the storage space? No problem, maybe. Yeah.

<blank>

<blank>

So, what kind of slaves are you looking for?"

I was thinking, "Hmmm, I'd like to find a girl who is cute and not too expensive. First of all, it's not that expensive, and she's a pretty girl, and by the way, I'm hoping for a bargain with some skills. Maybe a gold coin?"

...... is a hard order to fill.

<blank>

I know - but doesn't that mean there aren't any?　There are so many quirks.
