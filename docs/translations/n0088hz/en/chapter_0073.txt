# I Came to the Slave Trader

Due to the arrival of refugees, it seems that the information about the fall of the Alchemy Kingdom has finally spread to the general public.

<b>

“Ugh. I wanted to visit the Alchemy Kingdom... I never thought it would be destroyed.”

<b>

Recently, dear Diya, who has just started getting into alchemy, was a bit down after hearing the news that the Alchemy Kingdom, the holy land of alchemy, had fallen.

...Even if I go now to see the destroyed town, it wouldn’t mean anything.

<b>

And sorry, but it was our god who destroyed it.

If the king of the Alchemy Kingdom hadn’t claimed to be the god of chaos, it wouldn’t have perished!

Well, if the god hadn’t tried to destroy the Alchemy Kingdom, I wouldn’t be here either, so it’s all balanced, right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, after parting ways with my seniors, the next day, I came to the slave trader.

After all, you can’t talk about reincarnation in another world without mentioning slaves...!

<b>

There are a lot of people here. ...It seems that most of them are slaves for sale. There are so many that they can’t all fit in, and they look like ordinary people, still in the clothes they were sold in. They might be a bit dirty since they were refugees.

<b>

And here comes a long-awaited explanation from the basic knowledge.

Slave traders are the last safety net that even criminals can buy from. By purchasing those who would be discarded as a burden, they contribute to maintaining public order, and generally, they don’t refuse to buy. They seem to be connected with the authorities as well.

...Come to think of it, the slave trader in Verald was also a vassal of the lord. Yeah.

<b>

So, the result of buying the refugees from the Alchemy Kingdom as they were put up for sale is this overflowing crowd. They will surely be shipped to other towns in the future.

<b>

<b>

Now then, it’s time for my long-awaited shopping at the slave trader.

<b>

“Excuse me!”

“Yes, yes, are you looking to sell? Trade-in? Or are you considering a purchase?”

“I’m thinking about making a purchase.”

<b>

When I said that, the slave trader’s face lit up.

<b>

“Welcome! We are very pleased to have you, dear customer. As you can see, we have an overflowing stock, so if you decide to make a purchase, we would be truly grateful. ...Ah, however, since we haven’t been able to provide proper training, there are only a few slaves that are actually ready for sale. But! If you’re willing to provide the training yourself, we can offer you a discount!”

“By the way, how much would that be?”

“Normally, for trained slaves, the price ranges from one gold coin to several dozen, but for newly arrived untrained slaves, we can deduct five large silver coins from that! It’s a great deal. Seriously.”

<b>

Oh, that means the minimum price is fifty silver coins. It seems like I could manage that with the money I have as Karina Shonin. Well, I still have to borrow money from Diya since I would lose my business capital.

<b>

“It seems cheaper than I expected.”

“Well, taking care of slaves costs money, and that cost is added to the price of the slaves. It’s only natural that untrained slaves are cheaper when they just arrive. ...In other words, it’s a limited-time bargain price.”

<b>

It seems that the slave trader’s true intention is to hope that someone will take the untrained slaves before they become a liability. As long as there’s some profit, that’s a win for them.

<b>

<b>

“That said, if an untrained slave does something wrong, the master is responsible, right? I’ve heard that some slaves wait for their masters to be trapped by that and get bought again.”

“Hahaha, that’s a legendary rare case. Normally, they would be disposed of as unsellable stock. Or perhaps they were in cahoots with the slave trader.”

<b>

Putting aside the previous slave trader, it’s not like that now, so you can rest assured, the slave trader smiled.

My seniors, did you scare me? Well, it’s actually helpful to be warned strongly like that, so I appreciate it.

I guess I just need to not take the slaves out of the storage space. That should be fine, probably. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

“So, what kind of slave are you looking for?”

“Hmm. First, something not too expensive, a cute girl, and maybe a hidden gem with some skills. Around one gold coin?”

“...That’s quite a difficult request.”

<b>

I thought so, but isn’t there something like that? There are so many here after all.
