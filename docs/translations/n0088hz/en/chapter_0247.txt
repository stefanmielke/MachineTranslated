# I don't deny that.

Container in a Japanese-style backyard. A western style comfortable space in it. I am relaxing there.

By the way, I went back to my base and slept normally at night. There is no need to spend the night in the container. If you lock the door securely from the inside and return to the base, it is a comfortable home.

"Your tea, sir."

Yeah, thanks, Isiah."

<blank>

I sipped the tea that Isiah had brewed for me and breathed a sigh of relief. Well, today is going to be another good day.

And then came the pet. He was wearing his underpants. Hasn't this cat got any shame? I'm going to pet her bottom.

<blank>

"Whaaa...... good morning nyah!"

Good morning Misha. I think you should wear a skirt or something underneath."

Your wife was stroking my ass all over again yesterday. ...... You can complain to her, it's not my fault."

<blank>

No, I'm not complaining about anything. Misha, she's a beautiful girl to look at, and she's eye candy enough.

<blank>

I'll wear them when I go out. I mean, there are only women here, so don't worry about it, right?　Ah. I wonder if Arthur is a male. Well, he's a dragon, so it doesn't matter.

"............ I guess so!　Well, as long as I'm the one looking at you sexually, it's all good, right?"

I knew you'd wear them. Well, you're a guy who can get it on with a woman."

"Excuse me. That makes it sound like I could be a man.

<blank>

However, since Dia-kun is Dia-kun, I will make an exception.

Casually, Aisia serves Misha toast, fried eggs, and salad for breakfast. Misha sits down at the table and eats.

<blank>

So, are we going to find this dragon and negotiate with him today?

Yes."

......Seriously, Karina is that dragon maiden princess thingy?"

What are you talking about? Princess is a title that is only appropriate for you, Dia.

No, that's true, but in the sense of being able to talk to a dragon as an equal."

<blank>

Hmmm. I would certainly have to say that by that definition I am.

<blank>

I'm stronger than the dragon. My fists will break the dragon's fangs."

"Hahahaha, I'm joking. What kind of fist is harder than a dragon's fangs?

These are Arthur's fangs, the ones I knocked out before.

<blank>

He takes out Arthur's fangs, which he had previously beaten and broken with spatial magic, and shows them to him.

<blank>

"Oh, really?"

If you think I'm lying, ask Arthur. Why do you think Arthur is here in the first place?"

Because ...... Deere is so cute?"

I don't deny that."

<blank>

And then Mr. Dear and Arthur woke up there, too.

However, she is well dressed and today she is still in her miko princess costume - a gothic lolita dress.

I'll at least put a headdress on Arthur, I'll lend you mine?

<blank>

Good morning, you two.

Good morning. I forgot it's this way today."

Hello, everyone!　Today is the day of the battle with the dragon, isn't it?　Please show them your power!

<blank>

Arthur is in the groove. And he's ready to make me work for him.

I was wondering about the second dragon too, and I don't mind.

<blank>

...... By the way, didn't you say that breakfast would be served at Yohki's house?"

Ah."

<blank>

Come to think of it, that's what we talked about. Oh shoot, I accidentally ate it.

And I look at Misha, who is eating breakfast in progress.

<blank>

...... I'll eat two meals!"

Misha," she said, "you're a glutton. Good, good, good."

'At least pet my chin or my head instead of my butt, meow!

<blank>

Wow, this ass is really comfortable to stroke. That's a god butt!
