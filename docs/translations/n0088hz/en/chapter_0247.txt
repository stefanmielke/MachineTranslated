# I won't deny that

<b>

A container in a Japanese-style backyard. A comfortable Western-style space inside. I relax leisurely there.

By the way, I returned to my base and slept normally at night. There's no need to spend the night in the container. As long as I lock it securely from the inside and return to my base, it's my comfortable usual home.

<b>

"Master, here's your tea."

"Yeah, thanks, Aisia."

<b>

I sip the black tea Aisia made for me and let out a sigh. Ah, it looks like today will be a good day too.

Just then, my pet came over. With its pants completely exposed. Does this cat have no shame? I'm going to pet its butt.

<b>

"Yawn... good morning, nya."

"Good morning, Misha. I think you should wear a skirt or something down there."

"Yesterday, your wife petted my butt a lot, nya... You should complain to her, I'm not at fault, nya."

<b>

Well, I don't have any complaints. Misha looks like a beautiful girl, so it's quite a treat for the eyes.

<b>

"I'll wear something when I go outside, nya. Besides, there's only girls around, so there's nothing to worry about, nya? Oh, Arthur is a male, right? Well, he's a dragon, so it doesn't matter, nya."

"........... That's true! Well, it's not a problem if I look at you with lewd eyes, right?"

"You should definitely wear something. Speaking of which, you were able to handle it even if it was a girl, huh?"

"How rude. That would mean I could handle it even if I were a boy."

<b>

By the way, let's consider Dear-kun an exception since he's Dear-kun.

Aisia casually serves Misha breakfast: toast, fried eggs, and salad. Misha sits at the table and starts munching away.

<b>

"So, are we going to look for that dragon and negotiate today, nya?"

"That's right."

"......Is it true that Karina is the dragon priestess, nya?"

"What are you talking about? The title of 'princess' is more fitting for Dear-kun."

"Well, that's true, but I mean in the sense of being able to talk on equal terms with a dragon, nya."

<b>

Hmm. Indeed, if that's the definition, I can't help but say that I am.

<b>

"Well, I'm stronger than a dragon anyway. My fist can break a dragon's fang."

"Hahaha, stop joking, nya. What kind of fist is harder than a dragon's fang?"

"This one, the fang of Arthur that I broke before."

<b>

I take out Arthur's fang that I broke before using spatial magic and show it.

<b>

"Wait, seriously?"

"If you think it's a lie, ask Arthur. Why do you think Arthur is staying with me in the first place?"

"......Because Dear-chan is cute?"

"I won't deny that."

<b>

At that moment, Dear-kun and Arthur also woke up.

That said, they both tidied themselves up properly and are wearing their priestess outfits todayâ€”gothic lolita dresses.

Should I lend Arthur a headpiece too? 

<b>

"Good morning, you two."

"Good morning. I forgot that we were here today."

"Yo! Today is finally the day to battle the dragon! Please show us your power, sis!"

<b>

Arthur is really pumped up. And he's fully intent on making me work.

I've been curious about the second dragon too, so it's fine by me.

<b>

"......By the way, didn't you say that breakfast would be served at Youki's house?"

"Ah."

<b>

Now that you mention it, we did talk about that. Oops, I accidentally ate already.

I look at Misha, who is currently in the process of eating breakfast.

<b>

"......I'm going to eat two servings, nya!!"

"You're really greedy, Misha. Alright, alright."

"At least pet me on my chin or head instead of my butt, nya!?"

<b>

Ah, it's really nice to pet this butt. Truly a divine butt!
