# Carina is back!

<blank>

My name is Karina. I was playing with slime and I got itchy all over my body!

But my sweet Dia bought some medicine for me!　I put it on and, lo and behold, I felt better instantly!

<blank>

Karina-chan is back!　Karina-chan is back!　Karina-chan is back!

<blank>

Yes.

So, with the painkillers that Dia-kun bought for me, Karina is now safely back on her feet.

An itch is an irritation to the body. In other words, numbing painkillers are effective, ma'am!

Well, I've become active in modern knowledge!

<blank>

What, did it depend on the situation and could the painkillers make you itch more and more?

<blank>

Yeah, you must have had a good day!

<blank>

<blank>

Aside from what Aruji-sama does on a daily basis, here is some information about the sacred artifact."

Yes."

<blank>

While I was writhing in itch, Aisia was investigating based on the information that Dear-kun had brought along with the pain relief potion.

<blank>

The sacred artifact "Breaking Wall Hammer," also known as the "Breaking Wall Hammer," was displayed at the Akahagane Museum of Art as per the information obtained by Mr. Dia. It was displayed at the Akahagane Museum of Art, just as Dia-sama had informed me."

If it's on display, I guess it's okay if it's gone."

I think so. Since the mallet can only destroy castle walls to begin with, its only use would be to invade in war."

<blank>

Yeah, yeah, this shouldn't be like collecting and someone dies.

<blank>

'Well, let's make a quick collection and go to the beastman's country next. I hear there's a siesta of sea lions there."

It looks like it's going to go off without a hitch."

Maybe it's a little too peaceful, a little too boring.

<blank>

So I decided to head to the museum to check out the real thing.

I wanted to do some sightseeing while I was there, so I went for a casual stroll, and Deere and his friends were with me.

<blank>

"Sister, I bought some roasted meat on skewers. Here you go!"

Thanks, Dia!　I guess we can't miss the local skewered meat, can we? What kind of meat is this? It's so cheap!

Rock lizard meat!　They are very sexy, but they are edible meat. ...... is so salty. It's so heavily seasoned. It's so richly seasoned, my tongue is going to get sick.

"The seasoning is strong partly because we can get rock salt nearby, but also because it goes well with alcohol. ...... Aruji-sama, can I get some juice too?"

<blank>

That juice is an alcoholic beverage, isn't it?

Well, a little bit is okay. It's just easy sightseeing today, and Isiah is a half-dwarf, so he's good for a drink.

<blank>

"Oh, and while you're at it, get one for us, too. And get us some non-alcoholic drinks, please."

I don't think you'll find any alcohol-free drinks in these stalls, is that all right?　It will take a while."

Seriously?"

<blank>

I guess it's not that they don't serve plain water at the inns and other places, but I heard that liquor is the only thing they serve at the stalls because it sells better and can be preserved better.

<blank>

Then there's no point in drinking in the daytime, is there?

Oh, but go buy the weakest one possible. I'm about to preview my work.

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, Dia, I'll lend you this. It's a magical tool that turns any poisoned water into clean water, even alcohol becomes water.

I'm the one who made it, aren't I?　Dear, please use it!

"Thank you ....... Hey Isiah, what do people who can't drink usually do?"

I don't know of any dwarves, even babies, but if you're a traveler, you probably keep a canteen of water at the inn or something. If you are a traveler, you might keep a canteen of water at an inn or something.

<blank>

Well, you usually use bath water or something like that, right? Yeah.

<blank>

I'm very, very drunk. Ah, I'm getting tipsy.

<blank>

"Mister, should we go to the museum now?"

I know!　Hahaha."

I'm feeling excited!

'Ummm, hmmm. I was a little sad that they wouldn't let me have a drink, but I need an attendant who can think calmly, yeah. ...... I guess that means they trust me, right?"

<blank>

While Mr. Dear was talking like a driver who doesn't drink alcohol at a bar, we headed to the museum.
