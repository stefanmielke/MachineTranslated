# Karina-chan's Revival!

<b>

I am Karina-chan. While I was playing with slimes, my whole body started to itch!

But my cute Dia-kun bought me some medicine! Once I applied it, lo and behold, I instantly felt better!

<b>

Karina-chan is back! Karina-chan is back! Karina-chan is back!!

<b>

Yes.

So, thanks to the pain reliever that Dia-kun bought, Karina-chan has safely revived.

Itching is a stimulus to the body. In other words, pain relievers that numb are effective, you see!

Wow, modern knowledge really came in handy!

<b>

Huh, it depends on the situation, and there was a possibility that the pain reliever could make it itch even more?

<b>

Yeah, it seems my usual behavior was good!!

<b>

<b>

"Setting aside the usual behavior of my master, here is information about the divine artifact."

"Yes."

<b>

While I was writhing in itching, Dia-kun brought back some information along with the pain reliever potion, and Aisia investigated based on that.

<b>

"The divine artifact 'Castle Breaking Hammer', commonly known as 'Wall Breaking Hammer'. As Dia-sama obtained the information, it was displayed at the Akahagane Museum."

"If it's just displayed, it seems like it wouldn't be a problem if it went missing."

"That's right. After all, it's a hammer that can only destroy walls, so it would only be useful during invasions in wars."

<b>

Yeah, yeah, with this, there shouldn't be any issues like someone dying during the retrieval.

<b>

"Then let's quickly retrieve it and head to the beastman country next. I hear there's a bunny-eared Siesta there."

"It seems like everything will end without any incidents."

"It might be a bit too peaceful and boring."

<b>

With that, I decided to head to the museum to confirm the actual item.

I also wanted to do some sightseeing, so it was a casual stroll, and Dia-kun and the others were with me.

<b>

"Hey, I bought some grilled meat skewers. Here you go!"

"Thanks, Dia-kun! Local grilled meat skewers are a must. I wonder what kind of meat this is. It's salty."

"It's rock lizard meat! They stick stones to their bodies to increase their defense, but it's edible meat. ...Wow, it's salty. The seasoning is strong. This is going to make my tongue tingle."

"The strong seasoning is partly because rock salt can be obtained nearby, but it also pairs well with alcohol... Master, can I buy some juice too?"

<b>

That juice is an alcoholic beverage, right?

Well, a little is fine. Today is a relaxed sightseeing day, and Aisia is a half-dwarf, so she's strong with alcohol.

<b>

"Oh, and please buy some for us too. Make it non-alcoholic."

"There probably aren't many non-alcoholic drinks at the stalls around here, but is that okay? It might take a little time."

"Seriously?"

<b>

I mean, they do serve regular water at inns, so it's not like it's impossible, but it seems that stalls mostly sell alcohol since it sells better and has a longer shelf life.

<b>

Well, there's no point in drinking during the day.

Oh, but please buy the weakest one you can find. I'm going to scout for work after this.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, Dia-kun, I'll lend you this. It's a magical tool that turns any toxic water into clean water, and it can even turn alcohol into water."

"Oh, it's one made from the materials! Dia-kun, please use it!"

"Thank you. Hey Aisia, what do people who can't drink alcohol usually do?"

"There aren't any dwarves like that, even babies, but travelers might fill their water bottles with water at inns. For you, Master, you probably have enough water stored, so it's unnecessary."

<b>

Speaking of which, I do use regular bathwater and such. Yeah.

<b>

Gulp, ahh. Ah, I'm feeling a bit tipsy.

<b>

"Master, shall we head to the museum soon?"

"Yeah! Haha!"

"Oh, I'm really getting in the mood now!"

"U-umm. It was a bit lonely not being able to drink, but it's necessary to have someone who can think calmly, right? I guess that means I'm trusted?"

<b>

While Dia-kun was saying something like a designated driver at a drinking party, we headed to the museum.
