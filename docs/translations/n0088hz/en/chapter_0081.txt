# I'm craving pancakes ......

What should be purchased as a peddler? That is the question.

The basic idea is that the items are in short supply and in demand at the destination where they are carried, and can be purchased in large quantities at low prices.

<blank>

Socks, for example, are the worst. Since stable quality is available at all churches, there is no point in going to the trouble of transporting socks. The only thing that can be done is to store raw materials such as cotton in churches.

<blank>

On the other hand, if there is a special product that is only available in that city, it is a safe bet. If it is something that is in demand, it is the best of the best. It is the perfect, perfect trade item.

<blank>

...... but what are Solacidore's specialties?　I don't know. Nothing for me.

<blank>

<blank>

So we have come to the Solacidore Merchant Guild.

If you don't know, ask someone who does. I mean, as a merchant, I think I basically only deal with merchant guild relations.

Well, I have to go through the process of purchasing slaves, and I should ask at the counter.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I've purchased a slave and I need to go through the formalities. Also, I'm going to Carcassa, so please let me know what you recommend for stocking up."

<blank>

I asked the receptionist at the merchant guild directly.

<blank>

'Let me see your guild certificate. ...... Oh, it was among those contacted by the slavers. I'll add it to the list. And as for purchasing, if you have the diploma, it's alcohol and salt. ......"

<blank>

Unfortunately, I don't have any of them. Hmmm, too bad.

The loophole is that the trading partner must have a license. It is possible to buy in guilds and wholesale in guilds, but in this case the numbers are strictly checked and the interest rate is not good.

In Velarde, they were able to take advantage of the guild's weakness and buy them at market price, but those are the exceptions to the rule.

<blank>

'Hmmm, then it would be medicinal herbs. They are the raw material for potions, so there should be a chronic demand for them no matter where you bring them in. Please exchange information in the lounge to get more information.

Thank you very much. Oh, and what are Solacidore's specialties?"

You can buy a couple of bottles here.

<blank>

Was alcohol a specialty?

I'd need special permission to get a license for both alcohol and salt. ...... I might be able to get a license if I ask Grandma Maria, but not as a shonin. I want to earn money in the right way.

<blank>

What?　Is it the right way to borrow money from Mr. Dear to buy a slave and then introduce a healer to get a refund?　It's safe to say that the bargain for the slave might not have been found otherwise now!　Or what?　You're saying I should have left Isiah alone!

<blank>

I wonder who I am pissed at? Oh well.

<blank>

Are there any other specialties I can buy with my guild certificate?"

If I had to guess, I would say honey. The excess would go to the brewery, but you could trade enough to fill that backpack. It's ...... just heavy, so you'll need a carriage to transport the quantity. Do you have one?"

<blank>

I see, if there is mead, there is honey.

Okay, let's go with that line this time!

<blank>

Beekeeping was the fantasy beekeeping of taming bees.

It's great to be able to communicate with people in this way, isn't it? The farm is bigger than I expected.

<blank>

The guild introduced me to a beekeeper and I stocked up on honey.

The quantity is 1 silver coin for small, 5 silver coins for medium, and 10 silver coins for large. In addition, an unglazed jar is extra.

Four large ones, and with the bottles, that's 44 silver coins. I plunked down almost all of the lotion sales.

And I also bought beeswax for one silver coin, so all the lotion sales were gone.

<blank>

...... This is definitely a weight that would bottom out if I hadn't repaired the bag. Either way, it's okay because I'm going to use space magic.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, taste the honey taste ...... sweet!

I've only had fruit-based sweetness since I came here, but honey has a "sweetness" power that is incomparable. Sugar is wonderful!

<blank>

'Oh, it's so sweet I could cry. I'm starting to crave ...... pancakes. ......"

<blank>

I want hot pancakes, happily garnished with butter and honey. I'd like some whipped cream too, if possible. I wonder where I can get some at ....... If not, I'll have to make my own pancake mix.

Baking powder is baking soda, right?　Um, is baking soda a stone?　Oh, is pancake a mineral? ...... Oh no, I have no idea.

<blank>

A catalog that peeks out of the gap in my backpack catches my eye.

Why is it there?　I thought, "You should have put it in the storage space. ......" and opened it, and found a box of pancake mix, 5SP.

<blank>

Hmmm God good business.

...... No, I'll put up with it, but?　Karina, you're a woman who can put up with it.

However, considering that I currently have 1000 SP, and I have plans to deliver socks to Dea and Aysia, and to treat two more people to pancakes, I think that about 5 SP for a smile is an expense.

<blank>

Also, I'd like to check the functionality of the catalog. You know, you have to try ordering when you don't order directly from God, right?　So this is a necessary expense. A reward for yourself?　That's important. Right?
