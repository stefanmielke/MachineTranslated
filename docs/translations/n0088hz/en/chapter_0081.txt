# I'm starting to crave pancakes...

What should I stock as a traveling merchant? That is the question.

The basics are items that are in short supply and have demand at the destination, which can be purchased cheaply in bulk.

<b>

For example, socks are the worst. After all, stable quality ones can be obtained at any church, so there's no point in transporting them. The only thing I can do is supply raw materials like cotton to the churches.

<b>

On the other hand, if there are local specialties that can only be obtained in that town, it's a safe bet. If it's something in demand, even better. It's a perfectly perfect trading item.

<b>

...But what are the specialties of Solasidor? I don't know. Nothing comes to mind.

<b>

<b>

So, I've come to the Solasidor Merchant Guild.

If I don't know, I can just ask someone who does. I feel like I basically only deal with the merchant guild as a merchant.

Speaking of which, I need to complete the procedure for purchasing a slave, so I might as well ask at the counter.

<b>

"Excuse me, I need to proceed with the purchase of a slave. Also, I'm going to Karkassa, so please tell me recommended items to stock."

<b>

I directly asked the receptionist at the merchant guild.

<b>

"I'll need to see your guild certificate. ...Ah, there was a message from the slave trader regarding that. I'll add it. As for stocking, if you have a license, it's alcohol and salt..."

<b>

Unfortunately, I have none of those. Hmm, what a shame.

A loophole would be if my trading partner has a license. It is possible to stock from the guild and wholesale through the guild, but in that case, the quantity is strictly checked, and the profit margin isn't good.

In Verald, I was able to take advantage of the guild's weaknesses and have them buy at market price, but that kind of thing is more of an exception.

<b>

"Hmm, then maybe herbs? They are used as potion ingredients, so there should be chronic demand no matter where you bring them from. Please gather more information in the lounge and stock up."

"Okay, thank you. By the way, what are the specialties of Solasidor?"

"Honey wine. You can purchase a few bottles here as well."

<b>

So alcohol is a specialty.

Both alcohol and salt require special permits... I might get a permit if I ask Grandma Maria, but as a Shonin, that wouldn't be good. I want to earn properly.

<b>

What? Is borrowing money from Dia-kun to buy a slave and then getting a healer to introduce me for a refund considered proper? The hidden gems of slaves might not be found if I wait, so it's safe! Or what? Should I have just left Aisia alone!?

<b>

Wait, who am I even getting angry at? Well, whatever.

<b>

"Are there any other specialties I can buy with my guild certificate?"

"Then perhaps honey. The surplus is sent to the brewery, but you should be able to trade for enough to fit in that backpack. ...However, it's heavy, so if you're transporting a large quantity, you might need a cart. Do you have one?"

<b>

I see, if there's honey wine, then there should be honey too.

Alright, let's go with that this time!

Beekeeping was a fantasy-style endeavor involving taming bees.

Of course, being able to communicate like this makes things much easier. A larger farm than I expected.

<b>

I was introduced to a beekeeper at the guild and procured honey.

The quantities were small for one silver coin, medium for five silver coins, and large for ten silver coins. Additionally, unglazed jars were an extra charge.

I got four large jars, and with the jars, it totaled forty-four silver coins. I almost spent all the lotion sales on it.

And since I bought beeswax for one silver coin, all the lotion sales disappeared.

<b>

...If I hadn't repaired my bag, it would definitely have broken from the weight. Either way, I'm using spatial magic, so it's fine.

<b>

<b>

Now, time to taste the honey... so sweet!

Since coming here, I've only had sweet things in the form of fruits, but honey has an incomparable level of "sweetness" power. Sugar is wonderful!

<b>

"Ah, it's a tear-inducing sweetness... I'm starting to crave pancakes..."

<b>

I'll happily adorn hot pancakes with butter and honey. If possible, I also want whipped cream. ...I wonder if I can find somewhere to eat them; if not, I'll have to make them from pancake mix.

Baking powder is baking soda, right? Uh, is baking soda a stone? Wait, are pancakes a mineral? ...No good, I don't understand at all.

<b>

A catalog peeking out from the gap in my backpack catches my eye.

Why is it there? It should be stored in the storage space... As I open it, I see pancake mix priced at 5 SP per box.

<b>

Hmm, the god is good at business.

...But I can hold back, right? Karina-chan is a girl who can hold back.

However, I currently have 1000 SP, and with the planned delivery of socks for Dia-kun and Aisia, plus considering treating the two to pancakes, I think spending 5 SP for their smiles is a valid expense.

<b>

Also, I need to check the catalog's functionality. I have to try ordering without directly asking the god, right? So this is a necessary expense. It's like a reward for myself, right? That kind of thing is important, you know? Right?
