# I'll pay you a return!

<blank>

By the way, after the semi-finals, I had to skip the third-place match. But for various reasons, 80 pieces of silver coins were transferred as fight money.

<blank>

At the base at.

<blank>

I'm splitting it up because I got most of it in large gold coins.

<blank>

I took out the bag of gold coins God had given me.

<blank>

'Hey Karina!　I heard you didn't win, but what the hell is this money!　Where did you steal it from!"

I'm sorry," he said. This is the money I got from God. Oh, and I'll pay a proper return to you, Deere!　Let's see, how many gold coins?"

"......When you say you get money from God, don't you mean holy coins ......?　Oh, my portion is 20 gold coins. I'll take two large gold coins.

<blank>

For now, 20 large gold coins for Mr. Masilo and 2 large gold coins for Mr. Dia.

Also, give one large gold coin each to Isiah and all the Five Elders as a congratulatory gift.

<blank>

I have 72 large gold coins left - 720 gold coins!

<blank>

"Oh, oh, oh, oh ...... seriously, seriously!　Like 20 large gold coins!"

"......Oh ...... I feel soooo rich too!"

In fact, 700 gold coins, that's quite a lot of capital for a trading company, and that's a lot of money, right?"

<blank>

While Mr. Masiro and I were in high spirits, Dia put away the large gold coins without a care in the world.

...... Damn, isn't it cool and cool ......!

<blank>

God's Greatest Gold Coin...... something good material to work with?"

I think I'll make a weapon out of him. It might be able to dispel evil spirits."

I think I'll just keep it. It's Kari's present."

I'll make a pendant top to put a gold coin in and make it into a pendant. Shall I make one for you?"

I would use it embedded in a cup. It would be a good purification catalyst.

<blank>

It's pocket money and all the Five Elders don't seem to want to spend it as money.

<blank>

"...... Dear Sir, didn't I say before that 'it's complicated to receive an allowance greater than your price'?"

Save it for an emergency!　Hey!"

You said, "...... Huh, I understand. I'll have my grandmother make it into a pendant and I'll keep it on my skin. Well, thank you very much. But I will never stop being a slave!"

<blank>

I was a little angry with Isiah, but oh well.

<blank>

Oh, and what do you make, Mr. Masiello?

If you have 20 large gold coins, I think you can make something pretty good.

"Weapons, armor, maybe one more item?　What do we do?"

Masilo, can I have another one for an extra fee at a family member's price?"

"Can I make you an aphrodisiac?　I'll make it for you first?"

<blank>

The Five Elders are trying to squeeze money out of Mr. Masilo. Oh, my God, he has a strong business spirit!

...... so you didn't use your own gold coins as money!

<blank>

Oh!　Can I ask you for it as soon as possible!　The weapon is a dagger and the armor is light armor. I'll leave the items up to you, as you see fit.

"Yes, yes, I'll take your measurements - take it off, take it off, take it off."

I think I'll go with the wind claw dagger then. It's probably better suited for this, and I'll save some flying."

I'll use it as a speed-up, or rather a thought-accelerator armor. That way I can avoid it."

I've got Kari for the bag system. ...... should I go with the endless water bottles?"

"Hey, since Deere is here, why don't you take your measurements in the workshop?"

And maybe a bracelet that heals injuries?　I've got lots of stamina, so I can do it.

<blank>

All the Five Elders are very motivated!

<blank>

Hee-hee."　Are you serious?　If you can do it, I'll do it!"

I don't know much about it, but what's so great about it?"

It's not that amazing!　No, it doesn't mean anything to Karina, but ...... it's really great!　If it were true, it would cost twice as much!

<blank>

The wind claw dagger is a weapon that uses wind claws for range deception and long-range attacks with flying claws.

What?　What if I use it?　Yes, a good one with an area cutter.

<blank>

Thought acceleration is the one that makes it seem as if time is being stretched out by flowing magic power.

Huh?　In my case?　You're invincible and unharmed to begin with.

<blank>

The Infinity Canteen is an item that allows you to use and drink as much water as you want, and is also useful for washing weapons. ......

Huh?　In my case?　Maybe I'll go back to the base and take a bath?

<blank>

Injury recovery bracelets are bracelets that consume stamina but can close cuts and other injuries.

Huh?　In my case?　I'll use spatial magic to heal you, stick it to you, and you're back to normal.

<blank>

Each of them would certainly look strong if Masilo used them, but with me they would be useless. ...... sad ......

<blank>

I'm sorry, everyone. I'm just too powerful.

<blank>

...... Kari's equipment is really worth making, right?"

I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, "Is this unreasonable performance useful equipment, or are you pushing the envelope?"

I think the best thing we can do at the moment is to increase the efficiency of automatic magic recovery."

Actually, Kari, I put it in the ruffle of her dress."

"Well, I don't know if it made sense in the end, but ...... self-satisfaction?"

<blank>

Yeah, I'll hold you. I'm going to hug you all to sleep today!

<blank>

Oh, they are not going to implement the one that offsets the curse effect with a combination of equipment.

In the case of adventurer's equipment, I hear that it is dangerous because you never know when any of it will become unusable.

<blank>

In my case and Deere's case, they say it's good because we can go back to our bases that day and do maintenance.

...... What?　Considering the cost of the Five Elders' maintenance, the price of the equipment is practically sky-high?　Wow.
