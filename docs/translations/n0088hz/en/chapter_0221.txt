# I'll pay you back!

<b>

By the way, after the semifinals, I completely skipped the third-place match. However, due to various circumstances, it seems that the fight money of 80 silver coins has been deposited.

<b>

So, at the base.

<b>

"I was holding onto the money, but since I received most of it in gold coins, I'll divide it up!"

<b>

I took out the pouch of gold coins given to me by the god.

<b>

"Hey, Karina!? I heard you didn't win, but what is this money!? Where did you steal it from!?"

"How rude. This is money I received from the god. Oh, and I'll make sure to pay you back properly, Dia! Um, how many gold coins was it again?"

"…Receiving money from the god means it's holy money, right...? Oh, my share is 20 gold coins. I'll take 2 large gold coins."

<b>

For now, I gave 20 large gold coins to Mashiro-san and 2 large gold coins to Dia-kun.

Also, as a congratulatory gift, I gave 1 large gold coin each to Aishia and the Five Elders.

<b>

I still have 72 large gold coins left—720 gold coins!!

<b>

"W-w-whoa... Seriously, seriously!? 20 large gold coins!?"

"…Whoa... I feel like I've become super rich too."

"In reality, having 700 gold coins is quite a significant amount even as capital for a trading company, right?"

<b>

While Mashiro-san and I were getting excited, Dia-kun calmly put away the large gold coins.

…Ugh, so cool and stylish...!

<b>

"The god's large gold coins... I wonder if they can be used for something good?"

"I think I'll process them into weapons. They seem like they can repel evil spirits."

"I think I'll just keep them as they are. It's a present from Kari-chan, after all."

"I'll make a pendant top that can hold gold coins and turn it into a pendant. Should I make one for A-chan too?"

"I'll embed them in a cup and use it. It seems like a good purification catalyst."

<b>

Even though it's pocket money, it seems like the Five Elders have no intention of using the money as money.

<b>

"…Master, didn't I say before that 'it's complicated to receive pocket money that's more than my worth'?"

"Save it for emergencies! Okay?"

"…Sigh, understood. I'll also have my grandmother turn it into a pendant and keep it close to me. Um, thank you. But I absolutely won't stop being a slave!"

<b>

I got a bit scolded by Aishia, but that's fine.

<b>

"Oh, so what will you make, Mashiro-san?"

"If I have 20 large gold coins, I think I can make something pretty good."

"How about a weapon and armor, plus one item? What do you want to do?"

"If it's Mashiro-san, I can give you an extra one at a family price, okay?"

"A love potion would be fine too, you know? I'll prioritize making it for you!"

<b>

And just like that, the Five Elders were eager to squeeze money out of Mashiro-san. Oh dear, they're quite the business-minded people!

…So that's why they didn't use their own gold coins as money!

<b>

"Oh! Can I ask right away!? For the weapon, I'll go with a dagger, and for the armor, light armor. I'll leave the item up to you all!"

"Okay, okay, I'll take your measurements—take it off, take it off!"

"Then I'll go with the Wind Claw Dagger. It should suit me, and it'll save on ranged attacks."

"I'll go with armor that enhances speed, or rather, thought acceleration. That way, I can dodge better."

"Since we have Kari-chan, how about we go with a bag type…? Should we make it an infinite water bottle?"

"Hey, Dia-chan is here, so let's take the measurements at the workshop, okay?"

"How about a bracelet for healing injuries? I have plenty of stamina, so I can manage."

<b>

The Five Elders are really motivated!

<b>

"Whoa! Seriously, is it really okay!? If I can ask for that, then I'll do it!"

"Eh, I don't know much, but what's so amazing about it?"

"It's not just amazing!? I mean, it doesn't mean anything to Karina... but it's super amazing, you know!? If it were real, it would easily cost double!"

<b>

The Wind Claw Dagger is a weapon that can shoot claws for range deception or launch claws for ranged attacks.

Huh? What if I used it? Well, it would be a good area cutter.

<b>

Thought acceleration is something that, when magic power is flowed into it, makes it feel like time has been extended.

Huh? In my case? Well, I'm invincible and unharmed.

<b>

The infinite water bottle is an item that allows unlimited drinking of water, and it's also convenient for washing weapons...

Huh? In my case? I guess I'll just go back to the base and take a bath?

<b>

The healing injury bracelet consumes stamina but can seal cuts and such.

Huh? In my case? I can heal and reattach with spatial magic, so I'm back to normal.

<b>

Each of these does seem strong if Mashiro-san uses them, but for me, they'd become useless... how sad...

<b>

"Ugh, I'm sorry everyone. It's just that I'm too strong."

<b>

"…Kari-chan's equipment is really worth making, you know?"

"Exactly. It feels like a challenge to create equipment that can match this unreasonable performance—pushing the limits?"

"I think the best so far is the automatic magic recovery efficiency increase."

"Actually, I had it embedded in the frills of Kari-chan's dress."

"Well, in the end, I don't know if it had any meaning... just self-satisfaction?"

<b>

Yeah, I'll embrace it. Today, I'm going to hug everyone and sleep!!

<b>

Oh, it seems they won't implement a curse effect cancellation with equipment combinations.

For adventurer equipment, it's dangerous because you never know when something will become unusable.

<b>

It seems that for Dia-kun and me, it's fine because we can return to the base for maintenance every day.

…Huh? Considering the maintenance costs for the Five Elders, does that mean the equipment price is practically a breakthrough? Whoa.
