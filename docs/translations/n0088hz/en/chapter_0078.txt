# I must proceed immediately!! (From the perspective of a slave trader)

(I messed up the scheduled post and ended up posting two chapters)

----------------

<b>

<b>

The previous slave trader was arrested for selling illegal slaves.

And as his successor, I became the new slave trader in the town of Sorashidore.

<b>

For the time being, I will likely be cleaning up after my predecessor.

Since my predecessor was involved in crime, the scrutiny from those around me will be strict for a while. At the very least, I must engage in honest transactions for several years――just as I was thinking that, news arrived that the neighboring country had fallen.

<b>

The fall of a country is a major event, and of course, it is no exception for slave traders. Rather, it is precisely the slave traders who become the busiest.

Thus, I was in the midst of sourcing from the refugees of the Alchemy Kingdom――legally and ethically, unlike my predecessor――and my stock was overflowing.

<b>

A dying slave that the previous slave trader had was sold.

The buyer was a new merchant. The source of the funds was likely the noble lady who accompanied him.

Since I decided to conduct honest transactions, I had mentioned that I would accept returns...

<b>

It seems that the new merchant has come right away.

He probably couldn't heal the slave. With such an old injury, I wonder if even the rumored holy magic could heal it. Moreover, there was a cursed tattoo on the body that hindered recovery magic.

<b>

However, since I had presented the worst slave first, with the intention of introducing better ones afterward, there is no particular problem. The previous trader had planned to use it that way, as it was a slave intended for disposal.

<b>

Now, I need to handle the refund and give him the gold coins. Next, I will introduce a slightly better slave.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, slave trader. I'm the one who bought the slave the other day."

"Oh, if I remember correctly, you are Karina Shonin, right? So, you are returning it? ...Oh, and that lady over there is..."

"Th-thank you for your help. Thanks to you, as you can see..."

"What! Ah, um. Could it be that this person is..."

"Yeah, she's all healed up. So I'm here to take care of the procedures. Oh, you’ve already completed your side of the paperwork, right?"

"What!?"

<b>

N-no way! She was in the worst condition among the stock!

I wondered if he was pretending that a different person was a slave――but after checking the magical signature, it was undoubtedly the dying slave we sold. ...To think she could recover from that state!

<b>

"And so, I thought I would introduce the healer who treated her."

"Y-you can introduce someone who can perform such healing?"

"Yeah, if it’s convenient, I can bring her this afternoon. How about that?"

<b>

The cursed tattoo was gone, the old burn wounds healed, the throat that had been crushed by drugs was restored, and even the missing arms were healed in such a short time.

<b>

A connection with such a healer is something I would want desperately.

<b>

"No, I’ll pay the introduction fee upfront. Full refund, one gold coin."

"Eh, is that okay?"

"Yes. And once I can request work from that healer, I will pay an additional gold coin."

"Oh! How generous! Alright, I’ll bring her this afternoon!"

"Yes, let’s do that."

<b>

If this connection is genuine, even paying a hundred gold coins would be worth it.

If all goes well, this amount is not a big expense.

It is a gamble whether she will actually bring her, but since she said she would, it shouldn’t be a bad bet.

<b>

The new merchant received one gold coin and put it in his wallet, humming a tune.

<b>

<b>

...Wait, I hadn’t processed the paperwork since I thought it was a return!

I must hurry and take care of the procedures immediately!!

<b>

<b>

And in the afternoon, the new merchant returned with the healer.

Dressed in a robe and wearing a mask, they had a suspicious appearance. Clearly, they were hiding their original body shape.

It seems they are very keen on not revealing their identity.

Whether that is to hide their power or because they are a fraudster... that will be revealed soon.

<b>

"Hey, I brought her."

"Well, well, welcome. Is that the healer in question?"

"Yeah. He’s a bit shy, so, well, just take the hint."

<b>

The suspicious figure gave a small bow. Since he referred to them as "he," it seems to be a man.

<b>

"There are some illnesses I can’t heal, but I should be able to heal quite a lot."

"Yes. As long as the healing power is genuine, I have no particular concerns. By the way, how should I address you?"

"......You may call me Healer."

<b>

A low, hoarse voice. Healer, the healer. It seems he has no intention of revealing his name.

However, that doesn’t pose any particular problem. Rather, I should avoid prying too much to not offend him. If he is a fraudster, such concern would be unnecessary...

<b>

"Then, Healer. Excuse me, but could you demonstrate your power?"

"Very well... Where is the patient?"

"Right here."

<b>

Saying that, I removed my prosthetic leg.

The patient is myself. It was about ten years ago that I lost my left leg in a carriage accident.

Even now, it hurts on rainy days; it is a genuine old injury.

<b>

If he can heal this, he is undoubtedly genuine. Now, let’s see how he responds.

<b>

"......Very well. Lie down over there."

<b>

The Healer pointed to a long chair in the room without examining the wound.

<b>

"Here?"

"It should be sufficient. Shonin, prepare the ritual."

"Yes, yes. I’ll prepare it. Alright. I’m just a mere assistant, so don’t mind me."

<b>

Following the Healer’s instructions, the new merchant placed small items around me.

A cloth was placed over my left leg. I was tickled with a brush, making me feel itchy.

<b>

"Now, I will perform the ritual. Look at the ceiling, straight ahead... Ahem. Jugemu, Jugemu, Gokō no, Surikire..."

<b>

As the Healer began to chant an incantation I had never heard before, I felt a tickling sensation at the base of my lost left leg.

...By the way, how long will I be tickled with this brush? Wap! Not the face!

<b>

"Kūnerutokoro ni Sumutokorō, Yaburakōji no Burakōji..."

"Alright, excuse me for covering your face."

<b>

At that moment, the new merchant covered my face with a cloth. ...I can’t see anything. The Healer’s incantation continues.

<b>

"Ponpokopī no, Ponpokonā no... Chōkyūme no Chōsukē!"

<b>

With a clap! the sound of hands clapping echoed. Then it became quiet. ...Was the ritual completed?

<b>

"That’s enough."

"Huh... um, what?"

<b>

Then I sat up and looked at my left leg. For the first time in ten years.

It was there, as if it were "only natural" to be there.

<b>

"Ah, my leg... is... there...!!"

"Indeed."

<b>

The Healer nodded proudly. The toes could move. There was sensation! ...It’s real!

I bowed my head to the Healer, no, to the Healer-sama.

<b>

"I apologize for my doubts! Oh, how can I express my gratitude!"

"......Just pay the treatment fee, and that will suffice. Five gold coins."

"Five gold coins!?"

<b>

Just that much!? For such a divine act, only five gold coins is enough!?

Normally, even for reattaching a severed arm, ten gold coins are charged! Let alone for an old injury, where the lost leg was nowhere to be found!!

<b>

"That’s just too little, five gold coins..."

"No, it is precisely five gold coins. Now, please pay."

"Ugh, ugh..."

<b>

The new merchant had also warned me, "It’s precisely five gold coins. You cannot pay more than that."

N-no. It’s unthinkable that someone capable of such a feat would not know the market rate for healing. Especially since a merchant, albeit a new one, is accompanying him.

Surely, the Healer-sama must have a profound reason behind this!

<b>

"I understand. I will pay five gold coins...!"

"Indeed. Is it acceptable for five gold coins for each person treated in the future?"

"Y-you will continue to see me! I understand, I will pay."

"Once a month, I will visit. At that time, I will treat up to five people at once."

"I understand. I look forward to your visit, Healer-sama."

<b>

With joy at being able to assist this person in their noble mission, I bowed my head.

In the shock of it all, I realized I had forgotten to give the new merchant the additional intermediary fee after the Healer-sama left.
