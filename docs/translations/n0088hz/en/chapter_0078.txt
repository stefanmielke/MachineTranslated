# If I don't get the procedure done soon! (slaver's point of view)

(Oh shit, I made a mistake posting my reservation and posted two episodes.)


----------------

<blank>

<blank>

A previous slave trader was arrested for selling illegal slaves.

And as a replacement, I became the new slaver of the town of Solacidore.

<blank>

For the time being, he will be covering his predecessor's ass.

The fact that my predecessor had been involved in crime meant that I would be under intense scrutiny for a while. Just as I was thinking that I had to be honest in my dealings for at least a few years, word came to me that a neighboring country had been destroyed.

<blank>

A country dying is a big deal, and of course, the slavers were no exception. In fact, the slavers were the busiest part of the business.

So, I was in the midst of purchasing from the refugees of the Alchemy Kingdom - only legally and conscientiously, unlike my predecessor - and my inventory was nearly overflowing.

<blank>

A dying slave that the previous slaver had been holding was sold.

It was bought by a new merchant. The source of the funds would be the noble lady who was accompanying him.

I did say that I would accept returns because I am determined to do business in good faith. ......

<blank>

It seems that this new merchant came in early.

I guess he couldn't be healed after all. Even the rumored sacred magic would not be able to heal such an old wound. Besides, he even had a cursed tattoo on his body that inhibited his recovery magic.

<blank>

However, there was no particular problem, since the slaves were originally put out with the idea of first showing the worst slaves and then introducing the better ones. The previous owner had also purchased the slaves with the intention of using them in that way, with the assumption that they would eventually be disposed of.

<blank>

Now, I have to give you gold coins in response to your refund. Next time, I'll show you some better slaves.

<blank>

<blank>

"Hello, slaver. I bought a slave the other day."

Oh, it's Carina Shonin, isn't it? Are you returning the stone? ...... Oh, and your daughter is ......"

Oh, thank you very much for your help. Thanks to you, this street ......"

What?　Oh, um. If you are this way..."

I'm all healed up. So I'm going to go and do the procedures now. Oh, the slaver's side has already gone through the procedures, right?"

Huh?

<blank>

Oh, no way!　I was a slave in the worst condition in the inventory!

I thought he might be pretending to be another person as a slave - I had to have a magic match, but it was definitely that dying slave we sold at our place. I was surprised that he was able to recover from that ...... condition!

<blank>

So I thought I'd introduce you to the healer who fixed this."

Can you refer me to someone who can treat me as well as this?"

If it's convenient, I'll bring him in this afternoon. How's that?"

<blank>

The cursed tattoos are gone, healed an old burn, healed a drugged throat, and even healed a missing arm in such a short time. And all this in such a short period of time.

<blank>

A connection with such a healer, of course you want it by the throat.

<blank>

'No, we'll pay your referral fee, even if you pay in advance. Full refund, one gold coin."

"Oh, you don't mind?"

Yes. And then, when I am able to commission the work to that healer, I will pay you one more gold coin for the additional work."

Oh!　You're so generous. Okay, I'll bring him back this afternoon!"

Yes, I will do so.

<blank>

If this connection is true, it would pay for itself with 100 gold coins.

Hopefully, this is just a small expense.

It is a gamble whether they will really bring him, but it should not be a bad gamble because they will bring him.

<blank>

The new merchant received one gold coin and hummed it into his wallet.

<blank>

<blank>

I didn't process ...... because I thought it was a return anyway!

I'll have to get ahead of this and get the procedure done right away!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Then in the afternoon. The new merchant came again with his healer.

Dressed in a robe and wearing a mask, he has a suspicious appearance. He is clearly dressed to hide his original shape.

I guess that's how much they don't want to reveal themselves.

Whether it is to hide its power or whether it is a fraud ...... will remain to be seen.

<blank>

Hey there, I brought you.

Well, well, well. Welcome, welcome. Is that the healer in question?"

He's shy. He's shy. Well, you know, guess what?"

<blank>

A suspicious figure bows with a small bow. I wondered if he was a man.

<blank>

Some diseases can't be cured, but a lot of them can.

Yes, as long as the healing power is real. As long as the healing power is real, we don't mind. So, what should I call you?

You can call me the ...... healer."

<blank>

Low, wrinkled voice. Healer, healer. I guess that means he doesn't particularly want to tell me his name.

However, that doesn't mean that there is anything in particular to be troubled about. In fact, we should not be in a bad mood by shoving it down their throats. It would be an unnecessary concern if you were a con artist. ......

<blank>

I'm sorry, but can you show us your power in person? Excuse me, but may I see your power in action?"

"Yo, ......, where's the patient?"

Here."

<blank>

With that said, I removed my prosthetic leg.

The patient is myself. I lost my left leg in a carriage accident about 10 years ago.

It still hurts on rainy days, a real old wound.

<blank>

If you can fix this, you are definitely the real deal. Now, let's see how it comes out.

<blank>

"...... Alright, I'll be right with you. Lie down there."

<blank>

Mr. Healer did not examine the wound, but quickly pointed to a couch in the room.

<blank>

Here, sir?"

Enough is enough. Shaunin, prepare the ritual."

I'll get ready. I'll get ready. I'm just an assistant. I'm just a free assistant, so please don't mind me.

<blank>

At Mr. Healer's direction, the new merchant places small items around me as I lie down.

The left leg was covered with a cloth. The brush tickled my body, making me itchy.

<blank>

Now we will perform the ritual. Keep your eyes on the ceiling, straight ...... Gohon. Jugemu, jugemu, goko no no, slikilee ......."

<blank>

As Mr. Healer begins to chant a spell I have never heard before, I feel an itch at the base of my left leg, which I have lost due to my imagination.

...... By the way, how long will I be tickled with a brush?　Wapu, don't do the face!

<blank>

"Smutcorro in Coonertocorro, Yablacozi's Blacozi ......"

Yes, please excuse my face!"

<blank>

And here the new merchant put a cloth over my face. I can't see ...... anything. Mr. Healer's spell continues.

<blank>

Pompocopy's, Pompoconer's, ...... chocumee chocumee chocumee!"

<blank>

The sound of clapping hands!　and the sound of clapping hands. And then it gets quiet. Is the ...... ritual over?

<blank>

That's enough."

"Huh. ......, eh?"

<blank>

Then I got up and looked at my left leg. For the first time in ten years.

It was there as if it was a matter of course.

<blank>

"Oh, there's ...... a foot ......!

Mm.

<blank>

Mr. Healer nods in approval. My toes are moving. I can feel it! It's ...... real!

I hung my head to Mr. Healer, or rather Master Healer.

<blank>

'I am sorry I doubted you!　Oh, how I thank you!"

"...... pay for the treatment and that's it. Five gold coins."

Five gold coins!

<blank>

That's all it takes!　You want only 5 gold coins for this work of God!

Normally, they would take 10 gold coins even to join a severed arm!　And even though it was an old wound and the lost leg was nowhere to be found!

<blank>

Oh, no. Five gold coins.

No," he said. No, it's exactly five gold coins. Now, please pay me."

G, gnu ......."

<blank>

The new merchant also nailed me with the words, 'Five gold coins exactly. You must not pay more than that,' he was nailed to the wall.

No, no. It is inconceivable that a person who can do such a great job does not know the market price of healing. And even though he is a newcomer, he is accompanied by a merchant.

I am sure Master Healer must have some deep thoughts!

<blank>

I understand. I will pay you five gold coins. ......!"

"Yes. Can I continue to pay you five gold coins per person cured?"

I will see you again in the future?　All right, I'll pay you."

'I'll visit once a month. We'll see them all together then--oh, no more than five at a time."

We are waiting for you, Master Healer. We are waiting for you, Master Healer."

<blank>

I bowed my head with the joy of helping this man in his noble mission.

It was only after the healer left that I realized, to my utter shock, that I had forgotten to give the new merchant an additional brokerage fee.
