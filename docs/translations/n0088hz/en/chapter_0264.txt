# A Terrifying Presence

<b>

The merchants were heading towards the imperial town, surrounded by mercenaries.

<b>

"It's over..."

"Ugh... This shouldn't be happening...!"

<b>

If they don't offer up their treasures, the dragon will come after the merchants.

In other words, the merchants will become the traitors who have incited the dragon against the empire.

<b>

Even if they try to make excuses, the merchants are being watched by the mercenaries, and the mercenaries will testify that the merchants incited the dragon.

They had intended to abandon the mercenaries first, so the mercenaries would show no mercy.

<b>

"What should we do now... Ha! That's right, the imperial army can hold their own against dragons!"

"Y-Yes! Hey you guys! Help us out!"

<b>

The imperial army. Indeed, if they mobilize their full strength, defeating two dragons is not impossible.

It is a meritocratic army. Among the generals, there are fierce warriors who could likely stand against a dragon alone.

<b>

A chance for a comeback. If they eliminate the dragon, they can wipe this debt clean!

<b>

<b>

However, the mercenary shook his head.

<b>

"I refuse."

"What!? Why!?"

"Why? That's exactly why. Why would we need to help you? You betrayed the mercenaries."

"It's the mercenary's job to die when told to by their employer!?"

"No. Our job is to fight. It's not to become sacrifices."

<b>

Dying in battle and being made a sacrifice after being captured are two different matters.

<b>

"We are guaranteed safety if we hand you over. There's no need for a pointless fight, right? Avoiding losses is a good condition for a mercenary."

<b>

The mercenary scoffed, telling the merchants to think about profit and loss.

<b>

"B-But there's a possibility that the dragon will break the promise..."

"The dragon is a proud species. I've heard they don't break promises. They're much more trustworthy than you."

"Ugh..."

<b>

The mercenary laughed at the groaning merchant.

<b>

"Well, as you know, mercenaries are a kind of merchant too. Merchants who sell their military strength. So, we understand merchants just as well. Spill everything. That's the dragon's demand, right?"

"B-But! If we do that, our trading company will go under..."

"I don't care. You chose the wrong path. You literally stumbled into the dragon's tail."

<b>

That's a proverb synonymous with self-destruction.

Usually, it refers to making an irreparable mistake in a transaction that leads to ruin, but this time the opponent is a real dragon. In a sense, it can be considered the original usage.

<b>

"At least your life will be spared; you can work somewhere as a laborer."

"That's..."

<b>

After that, the mercenaries skillfully extorted various things from the merchants.

In just three days, they liquidated the trading company and real estate, turning it into cash, and exchanged it for jewels and gold coins that would please the dragon, returning to the village with the demon tribe's slaves.

<b>

They understood that if they didn't do this, they would be the next targets of the dragon.

It was said to be a terrifyingly efficient operation.
