# The devil is in the details

The merchants, surrounded by mercenaries, were on their way to the imperial city.

<blank>

"It's over: ......"

"Ugh ...... this, this is not supposed to happen ......!"

<blank>

If the treasure is not offered, the dragon will come after the merchants.

In other words, the merchants would be the traitors who invited the dragons to join the empire.

<blank>

Even if he tried to talk his way out of it, the merchant would be watched by the mercenaries, and the mercenaries would testify that the merchant had coerced the dragon.

They tried to abandon us first, and the mercenaries would not relent.

<blank>

"What do we do now ...... ha!　Yes, the Imperial Army would be no match for the Dragon!"

That's it!　Hey you guys!　You must cooperate with me!

<blank>

Imperial Army. Indeed, with their combined strength, it is not impossible to defeat two dragons.

The Imperial Army is a meritocracy. Some of the generals in the general ranks are so fierce that they could stand alone against the dragons.

<blank>

A reversal. Once the dragon is taken care of, we can overthrow this tori!

<blank>

<blank>

But the mercenary shook his head.

<blank>

I refuse."

What?　Why!"

Why?"　That's exactly why. Where is the need to cooperate with you people?　You betrayed the mercenaries.

'It's a mercenary's job to die when his employer tells him to die!

No, it's not. Our job is to fight. It is not to be a sacrifice.

<blank>

There is a difference between dying in battle and being sacrificed without permission, even after being captured.

<blank>

We're certain we'll be saved if we give you up. We are sure that you will be saved if we give you up.　It's part of being a good mercenary to avoid wear and tear.

<blank>

The mercenary snickers and says, "If you are a merchant, think about your profit and loss.

<blank>

But there is a chance that the dragon will break his promise."

Dragons are a proud race. "Dragons are a proud race, and I hear they don't break their promises. They are much more trustworthy than you.

"Ugugu......"

<blank>

The mercenary snickered at the grumbling merchant.

<blank>

What, you know, mercenaries are a kind of merchants. A merchant who sells arms. So, I know about merchants as well. So, let it all out. That's what the dragon wants, right?

But," he said, "if we do that, our business association will not be able to survive!　If we do that, our business association will not be able to stand ......"

I don't know. You guys have lost your way. You literally tripped over the dragon's tail."

<blank>

It is a proverb synonymous with personal destruction.

Normally, it means to make an irreversible and catastrophic mistake in a transaction and be ruined, but in this case, the other party is a real dragon. In a sense, this is the original use of the word.

<blank>

"Well, you'll live, so why don't you go do some menial labor somewhere?"

Such as ......"

<blank>

The mercenaries then successfully robbed the merchants of their goods.

In just three days, he cashes in his business and real estate, turns it into jewelry, gold and silver coins that would please the dragons, and returns to his village with his ogre slaves and others.

<blank>

They must have understood that if they did not, they would be the next ones targeted by the dragon.

He said it was an uncanny feat of dexterity.
