# Is it in your backpack? (Mashiro's perspective)

<b>

<b>

<b>

The A-rank adventurer Mashiro, known by the title of Silver, ventured into the dungeon with the great magician healer.

With the new moon approaching, it feels like there are more monsters than usual.

<b>

"But the dungeon boss hasn't respawned yet, huh?"

"Indeed. Let's pass through without a hitch."

"…By the way, how long are you going to keep wearing that outfit, Karina?"

<b>

Mashiro called out to the healer, or rather, to her true identity.

<b>

"Well, for a little while longer. I just got my adventurer's certificate from the guild master after all. I thought I was F rank, but it turned out to be E rank."

"An F rank that can kill a Black Mantis is impossible. Well, even E rank is, but D and C ranks have time limits and all. …That voice and tone of yours feel quite out of place. Not that it matters."

<b>

The healer took out a water bottle from her backpack, drank, and put it back inside.

The backpack was stuffed with the corpses of monsters they encountered along the way. Clearly, it contained more than its apparent volume.

Mashiro wondered what kind of capacity it had. Since she was casually tossing things in front of him, she probably had no intention of hiding it. He decided to ask.

<b>

"…Hey, how much stuff can that backpack hold?"

"Oh, this is actually magical. Well, take a look."

<b>

Saying that, as they passed by the dungeon boss's room and reached the barrier before the core, the healer pulled out a bed from seemingly nowhere and placed it on the ground.

<b>

"…Huh? Hey, what’s that?"

"Well, I'm keeping an eye out to see if anyone comes to mess with the core, right? So I want a proper bed to rest on."

"Yeah, sure, but if you're bringing something that big, couldn't you have brought more rations or something?"

"I have food too, you know? I even have alcohol if you want."

<b>

Mashiro couldn't help but cover his eyes with his hand.

<b>

"Seriously?"

"With the great magician healer, this is a piece of cake."

"If someone like you existed, monster cuisine might not have been researched at all."

<b>

Monster cuisine was developed to be self-sufficient within the dungeon to reduce the burden of carrying supplies. It also greatly contributed to the food situation due to the location of Karkassa.

<b>

"Monsters are delicious, you know. I don't dislike them."

"Now it's not bad, but apparently it used to be terrible? Especially before the method for detoxifying crawler meat was established, it was really dangerous, or so the old man said."

"Wow, having a living witness means it's quite recent, huh?"

"No, the old man is a dryad, so he's pretty ancient. It's a story from over a hundred years ago. Apparently, the lord of Verald back then worked hard on it or something."

<b>

Ah, it was older than I thought, the healer muttered.

<b>

"I've never heard of a dryad before. They’re a long-lived race, huh?"

"I guess it's rare in this country. They live as long as trees. As long as they have water and light, they won't die, so they can manage even with little food, which is pretty strong."

<b>

Whether it was because of that or not, there were many laid-back types, and the slow conversations were a bit of a flaw. They didn't mesh well with the impatient Mashiro.

<b>

<b>

"Still, just keeping watch is boring. This kind of job is more suited for a dryad..."

"Ah, I'm going to head home for a bit. I'll leave a decoy here."

"Huh? Hey, wait a minute."

<b>

Saying that, the healer entered her own backpack.

Seeing the strange sight of her clearly going below ground level, Mashiro couldn't help but speak up.

<b>

"…Is your house in your backpack?"

"Are you coming too, Mashiro-san? I put up a barrier around the core, so even if we get ambushed suddenly, we should be fine for a while. If anything happens, I'll know."

"…Seriously? Anything goes with you, huh?"

<b>

Since it was a rare opportunity, Mashiro decided to visit her home.

After all, it would be boring just keeping watch.

<b>

<b>

Inside the backpack. It was very spacious.

It wasn't just a few times larger than the backpack; it was a great hall... no, a great plaza. There was even a house built on the other side, and a sea.

<b>

"What the heck is this… No wonder the Armor Ants can fit in so easily?"

"That's right! Here we go. Phew, I'm tired."

<b>

She slipped off her robe and changed from the healer to Karina. Her voice instantly transformed into Karina's.

At that moment, a half-dwarf slave rushed over.

<b>

"Welcome back, my lord. Oh, is this a guest?"

"I'm back, Aisia. This is Mashiro-san, an adventurer from Karkassa."

"O-oh. Nice to meet you?"

<b>

Mashiro, bewildered by the fact that someone was living inside the backpack, thought that with this much space, it might be possible, and shook hands.

<b>

"Aisia, please take on the healer role. Just keep an eye out."

"Understood, my lord."

<b>

Aisia bowed politely, and Karina draped the robe she had just been wearing over her. She thought that the body shape might not fit, but it seemed to be no problem at all.

<b>

"Well then, take care."

"I'm off, my lord."

<b>

As Karina patted Aisia on the shoulder, Aisia's voice perfectly transformed into that of the healer. The robe must have been a magical disguise. Mashiro had never seen or heard of such a magical tool, but he recognized that there might be things like that which he simply didn't know about.
