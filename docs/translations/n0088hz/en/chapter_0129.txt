# Is it in your backpack? (Masilo's point of view)

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Mashiro, an A-rank adventurer with the two names of White Silver, went to the dungeon with a great magician healer.

With the new moon approaching, there seem to be more monsters than usual.

<blank>

But the dungeon boss hasn't come back yet, huh?"

"Mm-hmm. Let's just pass through."

...... By the way, how long is Karina going to keep dressing like that?"

<blank>

That's how Masilo addresses the healer, or more precisely, his true identity.

<blank>

Well, for a while longer. I got an adventurer's certificate from the guildmaster. I thought I'd get an F, but it turned out to be an E."

'There ain't no such thing as an F rank that can kill Black Mantis. No, even an E, but there are D's and C's, period. ...... I mean, that tone in your voice is pretty uncomfortable. I don't mind."

<blank>

The healer takes a water bottle out of the backpack, drinks the water, and puts it back in the backpack.

It's a backpack that was stuffed with every single dead monster I encountered in passing. Obviously more than its volume.

Mashiro wondered what kind of capacity they had. He was popping them in right in front of me, so I guessed he had no intention of hiding them. He decided to ask.

<blank>

I'm sure you've heard of ....... How much stuff can that backpack hold?"

Oh, it's actually magic. Well, take a look."

<blank>

As he said this, as he passed the dungeon boss's room and came to the front of the ward before the core, the healer pulled out a bed out of nowhere and placed it on the ground.

<blank>

What about ......?"　Hey, what's that?"

You're going to use this as a temporary base of operations to keep an eye on the core to see if anyone misbehaves, right?　If so, don't you want a bed where you can get a good night's rest?"

No, no, no, no, that's all right, but if you're going to bring something that big,...... you might as well bring more preserves."

I've got some rice.　And alcohol if you want."

<blank>

Mashiro involuntarily held his eyes with his hands.

<blank>

Seriously?"

It's no big deal when you're a great wizard healer."

Maybe if there were guys like you, monster food would never have been studied at all.

<blank>

Monster food was researched in order to be self-sufficient in the dungeon in order to reduce the amount of luggage required for dungeon attack. It also contributes greatly to the food situation due to Carcassa's location.

<blank>

It's delicious, Monster. I don't hate it."

It's not so bad now, but it was bad in the old days," he said.　Especially before they figured out how to remove the poison from the crawler meat.

Heh, I guess it's pretty recent that there are living witnesses."

'No, the retinue is Driade, so it's quite old, more than a hundred years ago. The Lord of Velarde at the time did his best or something."

<blank>

Oh, it was longer ago than I thought. The healer murmured.

<blank>

I've never heard of Driade before. They must be a long-lived species."

I see. That's a rarity in this country. They live as long as trees. As long as they have water and light, the worst that can happen is that they die, so even if they don't have much food, they can get by.

<blank>

I don't know if it's because of this or not, but many of them are slow and slow conversationalists. It is not a good match for the impatient Mashiro.

<blank>

<blank>

"But then, all I have to do is keep an eye on things, or I'm bored. This is the kind of work that Driade is suited for. ......"

I'm going home. I'll leave my shadow warrior here instead."

What?　Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."

<blank>

With that said, the healer enters the backpack himself.

Masilo can't help but call out to the strange sight that is clearly below ground level.

<blank>

"...... is it in your backpack?"

Are you coming, Mr. Masiello?　I've put up a barrier around the core, so even if there's a sudden attack, you should be fine for a while. If anything happens, I'll be the one to know.

"...... Really? You can do anything you want?"

<blank>

Since it was a good opportunity, Masilo decided to visit the house.

I don't have time to be on watch anyway.

<blank>

<blank>

Inside the backpack. It was very spacious there.

It was not just a few times the level of a backpack, it was a large hall ...... no, it was a large plaza. What a surprise, there are even houses built on the other side, and even the sea.

<blank>

What the heck is this?"

That's right. I'm tired. I'm so tired.

<blank>

With a snap, she removes her robe and changes from healer to Karina. Her voice instantly became Carina's as well.

Then a half-dwarf slave rushes up to him.

<blank>

"Welcome back, Mister. Are you a visitor?"

I'm home, Isiah. Yeah, this is Masilo. Adventurer of Carcassa."

Oh, oh. Nice to meet you?"

<blank>

Mashiro shakes his hand, puzzled, wondering if they are letting people live in their backpacks, but thinking that if it's this spacious, that's possible.

<blank>

Aisia, I need you to be the healer. Keep an eye on things."

"Awe, my lord."

<blank>

She bowed to Aïssia and put on the robe she had been wearing earlier. I thought it might not fit her body shape, but she seemed to have no problem with it.

<blank>

Well, nice to meet you.

"I'm off, my liege."

<blank>

When Karina tapped her on the shoulder, Isiah's voice was exactly that of a healer. So the robe was a magical device for disguise. Masilo had never seen or heard of such a magical tool, but he recognized that there was such a thing that he just didn't know about.
