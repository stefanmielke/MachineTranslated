# Secrets of the World (Relatively Unimportant) ●Illustrations Included

"By the way, how are socks made in this world?"

<b>

I am Karina-chan. Lately, I've been pondering the existence of socks.

Looking back, the socks of my older sister Harumikazuchi were made of smooth, high-quality fabric, while Satitan's socks were the kind of cotton socks sold in Japan for 1000 yen for three pairs.

<b>

The more I think about it, the more I wonder how they are made.

<b>

<b>

Surely, the secret is held by the gods――thinking this, I had nothing particular to do, so I came to the church in Verald.

I don't have any business delivering socks, but I wonder if I can get some attention?

<b>

"…Wait, is that Siesta?"

"Yes, what is it, young lady――oh, it's you, my fellow? What brings you here?"

<b>

And there was Siesta, the pink-haired succubus sister, at the church.

<b>

"When did you come from Sorashidore to this town?"

"Oh, that's my cousin. It's a common name, so it's confusing."

"Oh, a cousin with the same name. I see that happens…"

<b>

Is it like the older sisters that appear in Pocket Monsters?

<b>

"…We're actually separate entities with that kind of setting, you know, fellow. We are assigned to various churches at random, and we are considered different people. Please don't delve too deeply into it."

"What do you mean by separate entities…?"

"It means a different body that shares knowledge and memories. Apparently, in Sorashidore…"

"…So, Siesta is in every church, and they are all actually one person?"

"It's the work of God. It's a secret."

<b>

Siesta puts her index finger to her lips, shushing me. So cute. I wonder if I could take one home?

Ah, but it wouldn't be useful for making socks for delivery.

<b>

<b>

"So, what do you need?"

"Well, I was curious about something and wanted to ask God…"

"What is it? If it's something that doesn't require troubling God, I can answer it."

"Then I'll ask. Where and how are socks made? Can they be procured?"

"Many are made as side jobs in the church and sold to clothing stores. It's not publicly disclosed, but there are magical tools for making socks."

"Oh, so there are such magical tools?"

<b>

Wow. Well, given it's under God's domain, it's to be expected, but it's a bit too convenient to have such magical tools.

<b>

"The materials for socks are raw fabrics like cotton and silk. They are generally in short supply throughout the year, so it would be appreciated if you could procure them. I can't offer much money, but I can sell you socks at a lower price."

<b>

Siesta said this while looking at the large backpack on my back.

It might be a good idea to supply sock materials to the church. For now, it would be wise to keep a few pairs, as I might encounter a beautiful woman not wearing socks again.

<b>

"The cheapest cotton socks are one large copper coin each."

"I see, that's relatively expensive, but not out of reach."

<b>

If one usually wears sandals, they might not need them, but traveling merchants would likely buy them to protect their feet.

<b>

<b>

"…Well, just between us, it's not a magical tool, but a divine artifact that can convert all kinds of materials, not just fabric, into socks."

"Wait. Um, I've been told by God to collect divine artifacts."

"Yes. I just received a message from God.――'No need to collect this, in fact, if you do, I'll be angry! Also, it's not allowed to deliver duplicates made from sock materials!' …That's what it says."

<b>

I thought so.

Considering the future offering to God, duplicates made with spatial magic are obviously not allowed. Yup.

<b>

"God's impression just now was super cute."

"Thank you, I'm honored."

<b>

Siesta bowed her head slightly.

By the way, is God distributing divine artifacts to each church for the sake of socks? No wonder there's an energy shortage. It's completely for their own benefit. Truly a god.

<b>

"And God entrusted me with this. Here you go."

"Oh, thank you?"

<b>

Siesta handed me a piece of paper she had somehow obtained.

…On the rectangular paper, it said "Assessment Value 20% UP Ticket."

It seems that the drinking contest with the pirates pleased God.

<b>

"And here's this as well. Please take it."

"…A pill?"

"Menstrual skip drug, one-time limited use."

<b>

M-menstrual skip drug (limited time) you say!?

<b>

"'It's about time for the first one, so here's a first-time service,' it seems. This is a limited-time medicine valid until this menstrual period ends, and if not used, it will automatically disappear."

"Uh, thank you?"

<b>

It's the menstrual skip drug I wanted. However, it can be limited time like this.

……

<b>

Wait a minute. Is this God's message saying, "Menstruation is tough, so you should use the skip drug every month, so you understand, right? Huh?"!?

Even pain that can be endured if one knows it won't be there from the start, if there's a divine hand that completely resolves it, it's only natural to reach for it!!

Moreover, this blatant limited time! It makes you feel like it's a waste not to use it, and it's clearly trying to make you use it!

<b>

Even if I try to stop time and store it, I'm powerless before God! Duplicates are meaningless!

<b>

"Hehe, it seems you are loved by God, fellow. I'm envious."

"Ahaha… ugh, I can't be happy about this…!!"

<b>

This is not unconditional love! It's a lure to make me deliver 50 SP worth of socks every month! A small investment! Sowing seeds!

What a terrifying God, what a strategy!!!
