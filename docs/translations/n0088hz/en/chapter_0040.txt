# Secrets of the world (rather unimportant) ● Illustrations

I mean, how are socks made in this world?"

<blank>

I, Karina-chan. After all this time, the question about the existence of socks comes to mind today.

Looking back, I remember that Harumikazuchi's socks were made of smooth, high-quality cloth, and Sati's socks were cotton socks, the kind sold in Japan for 1,000 yen for three pairs.

<blank>

The more I think back on it, the more I wonder how it was made.

<blank>

<blank>

The secret must surely be in God's hands - I thought so and came to the church in Velarde because I had nothing in particular to do and I was bored.

I don't have any sock delivery business, but I wonder if you could take me on?

<blank>

"What's that, ......?　Siesta?"

"Yes, what can I do for you, miss?　What do you want?"

<blank>

And in the church was Siesta, a pink-haired succubus sister.

<blank>

<blank>

When did you go from Solacidore to this town?"

'Oh my, that's my cousin. It's confusing, though, because we often have the same name."

'Oh, a cousin with the same name. That's one of those things. ......"

<blank>

Are they like the sisters in the pocket monsters?

<blank>

......We are separate individuals with that kind of set-up, gentlemen. We are assigned to different churches at different times, and we are different people. Please don't pursue it too deeply.

"Do you want to go to ......?"

'I mean another body with shared knowledge and memories. Thanks for the solacidore."

Does ...... mean that siestas are in every church and they are all actually alone?"

It's an act of God. It's a secret."

<blank>

Siesta puts her index finger to her mouth, "Shhhh. Cute. Can't I have one of those?

Ah, but it can't be used to create delivery socks.

<blank>

<blank>

So, what can I do for you?

'Yeah, I was just wondering about something and wanted to ask God about it ......'

What is it?　If it's something that doesn't require God's help, I'll answer it."

Then I will ask you. I wonder where and how socks are made. I wonder if we can stock them.

'Many of them are made in churches as an inside job and sold to clothing stores. It's not open to the public, but we do have a magical tool that makes socks."

Oh, you have that kind of grimoire?"

<blank>

What a surprise. No, it's natural to say that with God's permission, there are magic tools that are too useful and convenient.

<blank>

'The material for socks is raw material for fabrics like cotton and silk. They are in short supply all year round, so I would appreciate it if you could stock them for me. I can't give you much money, but I'll give you a discount on socks to compensate."

<blank>

Siesta said this when she saw the large backpack on my back.

Is it possible to buy sock materials from somewhere and wholesale them to the church, or something like that? In the meantime, it's good to have a few pairs for future use, in case I meet another beautiful woman who doesn't wear socks.

<blank>

The cheapest cotton socks cost one large copper coin a pair.

I see, it's reasonably expensive, but not unaffordable."

<blank>

If you're a regular sandal wearer, you probably don't need them, but peddlers and the like would buy them to protect their feet.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Well, between you and me, it's not a magical tool, but a divine device that converts any material, not just cloth material, into socks."

What? Um, I've been told by God to retrieve the sacred artifact."

Yes," he said. Right now, God is telling me. -'You don't need to collect this, and if you do rather, I will be angry!　Also, you can't use the material from the socks to deliver reproductions!' He says it's ......."

<blank>

Right?

Considering that I'm going to dedicate it to God in the future, of course a duplicate with spatial magic is a no-no, too. Yes.

<blank>

Your impersonation of God was super cute."

"Thank you very much. I'm honored."

<blank>

Siesta bows her head with a bow.

I mean, God, are you distributing sacred objects to each church for socks?　That would explain the energy shortage. It's totally for your own sake. That's God for you.

<blank>

And God gave me this. Here you go."

Uh, kids?

<blank>

Siesta offered me a piece of paper that he had been holding in his hand for some time.

That piece of paper in ...... rectangle was labeled 'Ticket for 20% increase in valuation'.

Apparently, the pirate and I had a drinking contest, and God seemed to like it.

<blank>

And this one, too. Go ahead."

"...... tablets?"

Period-skipping pills, one time only, period."

<blank>

A period-skipping drug (for a limited time only)!

<blank>

"'It's about time for the first one, and it's the first service,' he said. It's a time-limited medication that is valid until the end of this period, and if you don't use it, it will automatically disappear."

Uh, thank you?"

<blank>

It's the period skipping pills I've been wanting. But I guess I can do period skipping or something.

......

<blank>

No, wait. This is like saying, 'Your period is hard and you should use skip pills every month, so you know what I'm talking about, right?　Right? Isn't this a message from God?

<blank>

Even if the pain is bearable if you know it is not there at the beginning, you will inevitably reach for it if there is a divine move that will eliminate the pain once and for all!

And this blatant time limit!　They are trying to make you think it's a waste if you don't use it and make you use it!

<blank>

Even if you try to stop and store time, you are powerless before God!　Reproduction is also pointless!

<blank>

I am so jealous of you. I envy you."

"Hahaha ...... damn, I can't be honestly happy ......!

<blank>

This is not free love!　Priming to have 50SP worth of socks delivered each month!　A small investment!　Sowing seeds!

Fearful God, what a ploy!
