# What the!? (A-Rank Adventurer Mashiro's Perspective)

<b>

<b>

<b>

You need help, huh!? If you can help, then go ahead and try, damn it!

Looking over, that guy was, unbelievably, coming towards me with his eyes closed, making noise carelessly. What the hell are you doing in a situation like this!?

<b>

"Hey, run away!! Why are you coming this way!? It's a Black Mantis!"

<b>

With a creak, the Black Mantis turned its attention towards him. Was it planning to take out the weaker one first? Before I could stop it, it lunged.

In the next moment, just as I thought, "Oh no," something unimaginable happened.

<b>

The death scythe that could even cut through a dwarf's sword hit that guy's head and shattered.

<b>

"What the!? The Black Mantis's scythe shattered!? What kind of hard head does he have!?"

"Ah, damn it. Well, whatever... Air Cutter!"

<b>

And in the next moment. As if bored, the head of the Black Mantis was severed from its body along with a mutter.

...Huh? What just happened?

<b>

Not yet understanding that its head was gone, the Black Mantis wildly swung its scythe. Such tremendous vitality. However, it couldn't hit. Some branches around were slightly cut, but that was it.

The Black Mantis's movements slowed down slightly—and from within, a long, slender tentacle of mithril color appeared and lunged at the woman.

Mithril Devil. It has been confirmed to have emerged from the Black Mantis just before its death after rampaging for a week, and it is said to be the true body of the Black Mantis.

<b>

"Air Cutter! Air Cutter!"

"W-w-whoa... The Mithril Devil is being chopped up!"

<b>

Quickly, even a dwarf's sword could barely scratch it, and that thing, which had no record of being defeated, was being sliced to pieces by the woman's magic.

<b>

...Strong.

I could feel my throat gulping. I, who reached A-Rank solo, found that this guy in front of me was even stronger.

<b>

"Are you okay?"

"Yeah... Who are you? I've never seen your face before."

<b>

It was then that I finally opened my eyes.

<b>

"Beastman!! And a fluffy one! So cute!!"

"Huh? Just because I'm a beastman... Wait, what? Cute, you say?"

<b>

For a moment, I thought this person might be one of those who would say beastmen are savage, but the tone of voice and the emotions in her gaze were very positive. What is this? I haven't been called cute since I was a kid.

...Most people look at me and say I'm scary or that I look like I'll eat them...

<b>

No, if she's this strong, then surely even a dragon would be called "cute."

<b>

After that, we exchanged introductions.

It seems her name is Karina. I don't know if that's her real name. I've never heard that name before. It's hard to believe that such a strong person is nameless, but I won't pry.

<b>

...No, I thought I wouldn't pry, but she started saying something I couldn't ignore.

She doesn't know the rules of the lower levels or the door guards? What does that mean!?

<b>

"N-no, wait. What is a door guard?! There wasn't anything like that on the path I came from!"

"What!? There's no way that's true. Did you come from a new route!?"

"Ah, there was a beehive blocking the way... There wasn't a door either..."

"What the hell? Explain that in detail!!"

"Y-yes..."

<b>

Did I really discover a new route!? This is a big deal!!

<b>

"To be precise, there was a path, but there was a room filled with beehives."

"Wait a minute, I have a map. ...Where about is it?"

"Maybe around here. Huh? There was a path here, but it's not marked."

<b>

And unbelievably, she pointed to the blank part. Isn't that an unexplored area!?

Did she find a hidden passage!?

<b>

"Wait a minute, Karina, this should definitely have been a wall."

"Uh, well, now that you mention it, maybe it opened like an automatic door when the bees passed through."

"Such conditions... Well, that's helpful, but is it okay to talk so freely? This is quite valuable information."

"I caused you trouble, so let's say it's a report from Mashiro-san."

"Okay, got it. Damn, I don't get it, but if you have the strength to easily defeat a Black Mantis, I have no choice but to accept it..."

<b>

Karina must be able to hunt any monster at will and is probably not in any financial trouble.

<b>

"I'm really sorry. Are you hurt? I'll heal you for free."

"I'm fine, but my equipment got a bit messed up. I need to restock my darts too."

"Okay, I'll fix and restock them. How many darts do you need?"

"Huh? Are you going to buy them for me? Well then, as an apology, how about 50 of them?"

<b>

I thought it was a light joke since she didn't seem to be in financial trouble, but—

<b>

"Here you go."

<b>

Karina, unbelievably, pulled out 50 of my darts right in front of me.

...Huh? Those darts cost one silver coin each for a custom-made one.

Why does she have 50 of the same thing!? I only had 5 of these to begin with!?

<b>

"...Huh? Hey, wait, where did you pull those from?"

"Um, the armor... Ah, this part is torn. I'll fix it. Sorry!"

"Eh, no, that was a wound from another time—wait, what, the wound on the armor disappeared!?"

<b>

When Karina casually touched it, the wound on the armor vanished.

What the hell is going on!? I was just thinking it was time to replace it!?

<b>

"Ah! Now that I look closely, there's a wound on your chest too!? I'll heal it!"

"W-wait, that's an old scar—whoa!? W-what the hell are you!? The wound disappeared!"

<b>

The old scar on my chest vanished as well.

High-level healing magic!? Is she a priest!? Wait, but now—

<b>

"I'm glad to see you happy."

"I-I don't have any money!? You healed me without my permission!"

"Yeah, I don't need it. Oh, you have a cavity too, I'll fix that."

"W-what the hell!? Is it my fault!?"

<b>

I don't get it, I don't get it!!

She's done so much for me, what the hell does she want from me!?
