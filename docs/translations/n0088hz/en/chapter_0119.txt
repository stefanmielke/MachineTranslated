# Huh? (From A rank adventurer Masilo's point of view)

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Do you need help?　If you can help me, help me, damn it!

When I looked, I saw that the guy was probably coming toward me with his eyes closed, making rustling noises unprotected. What are you doing in a situation like this?

<blank>

Hey, run away!　What the hell are you doing over here?　It's the Black Mantis!

<blank>

With a click, the Black Mantis turned toward him. He pounced on it without a chance for me to stop him, as if he was going to finish off the weaker one.

Oh shit - and the next thing I knew, the unthinkable happened.

<blank>

The scythe of death, which cuts off even a dwarf's sword, shattered when it hit the man's head.

<blank>

What?　Black Mantis's scythe shattered!　What kind of stone head is that!"

'Oh, shoot. Oh well, no more ...... air cutter!"

<blank>

And the next moment. With a murmur, as if bored, the head of Black Mantis was detached from the body.

What about ......?　What happened?

<blank>

The Black Mantis, perhaps not yet realizing that its head has been removed, wields its scythe blindly. It has tremendous vitality. But it doesn't hit the stone. A few branches of the surrounding trees are cut off, but that is all.

Slightly, the Black Mantis slows down - a long, thin, mithril-colored tentacle appears from within it and attacks the woman.

Mithril Devil. It is confirmed to have emerged from the Black Mantis just before its death, which once rampaged for a week, and is said to be the main body of the Black Mantis.

<blank>

Air cutter!　Air cutter!"

Nah, wow. ...... mithril-devil-shredded."

<blank>

Quickly, even a dwarven sword could only wound it, and the thing, which had no record of being defeated, was shredded by the woman's magic.

<blank>

...... strong.

I felt my throat hitched. I had reached A rank solo, but this guy in front of me was even better than that.

<blank>

Hey, are you all right?"

Oh. ...... What are you?　I've never seen you before.

<blank>

And here I opened my eyes for the first time.

<blank>

I'm a beast!　And it's a mofu-mofu type!　He's so cute!

What?　You're a beast, you're a ......, huh?　Cute, huh?

<blank>

For a moment, I thought he was one of those people who would say that beastmen are barbaric, but the emotion in his tone of voice and in his gaze was very favorable. What a guy. I haven't been called cute since I was a kid.

...... Most guys look at me and say I'm scary or that I'm going to eat them. ......

<blank>

No, if they are this strong, surely even dragons must be "cute".

<blank>

Then they exchange self-introductions.

This guy seems to be named Karina. I don't know if that's her real name. I have never heard of her. It is hard to believe that such a strong person is unknown, but I will not pry into it.

<blank>

...... No, I was trying not to pry, but he said something I didn't want to hear.

Don't know the rules of the lower level or the door number?　What do you mean!

<blank>

It's not right. What is a doorkeeper anyway?　There was no such thing on the road I came from."

What?　How is that possible, you came from a new route?

"Oh, it was blocked with beehives. ...... There was no door. ......

Tell me more about it!

Hahii ......"

<blank>

We've really found a new route!　That's a big deal!

<blank>

There was a path to be precise, but there was a room that was a beehive.

Wait a minute, there's a map. ...... where is it?"

I think it's somewhere around here. What's that?　There was a road here, but it's not written down.

<blank>

And, as if out of the blue, he poked and prodded at the margin. It's an unexplored area, isn't it?

You mean you found a hidden passageway!

<blank>

Wait a minute, Karina, this was definitely a wall.

I think it might have opened like an automatic door when the bees went by."

I'm glad you're here, but I don't know if I'm allowed to blurt it out like that.　That's a lot of money."

I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you, so let's just call it a report from Mr. Masiello."

I'm not sure what's going on here. I don't know what's going on, but if he's good enough to defeat Black Mantis without difficulty, I have to agree with him. ......

<blank>

I am sure Kalina can hunt any demon she wants and has no money problems at all.

<blank>

I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?　I'll fix it for free."

I'm all right, but my equipment is a bit out of whack. I need to replenish my darts.

I'll fix it and restock. How many darts do I need?"

An?"　You're not going to buy it?　Well, then I'll take about 50 bottles as an apology."

<blank>

It was a lighthearted remark, but I thought that if the guy wasn't hurting for money anyway, he'd at least say that--

<blank>

Yes.

<blank>

Karina, out of the blue, put 50 darts in front of my eyes.

What about ......?　They're custom-made darts that cost one medium silver coin per dart.

Why do you have 50 of the same thing?　I only had 5 of these to begin with!

<blank>

I'm thinking, "Where's ......?　Where did you just get that from?"

"Well, the armor is at ....... Oh, it's cut off here. I'll fix it. Sorry?"

"Oh, no, that's a scar from another time--oh, that's a scar from my armor that's gone!"

<blank>

I felt Carina touch me in a familiar way, and the scratches on my armor disappeared.

What the hell is going on!　I thought it was time for a new one!

<blank>

Ahh!　If you look closely, you can see a scar on my chest!　I'll fix it!"

"Hey, that's an old wound.　Whoa! What the hell is wrong with you?　The scar's gone!

<blank>

Even Atashi's old wound on his chest disappeared.

High-level recovery magic!　This guy was a priest!　Oh, but now...

<blank>

I'm glad you're pleased."

Or it ain't money!　You fixed it on your own!

I don't need it. Oh, you have a cavity, I'll fix it."

What is it?　Is it my fault?

<blank>

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know!

You've given me all this, what do you want me to do?

<blank>
