# Something seems off...?

"Welcome to Tesshin. ...I don't know how skilled you are, but try not to die."

"I'm fine, I won't die. I'm strong, you know!"

<b>

We were seen off by the dwarf immigration officer and entered the country.

Apparently, there's a Thunder Dragon somewhere in the country... I'm looking forward to it! Plus, there's the "anything" reward from Dia-kun... slurp.

<b>

Ah. No, Dia-kun is a decorative beautiful girl. A decorative beautiful girl!

I've been forgetting that lately, but he's technically a boy!

Should I just take a bath together with him during this "anything" and visually confirm that Dia-kun is indeed a boy?

Since he's going out of his way to dress like a boy, I have to make sure not to forget... yeah.

<b>

Huh? Dia-kun dressing as a boy is to remind me that he is a boy, so isn't it a bit strange for me to be conscious of that...? Um... huh?

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Alright, let's get to it and go kill a dragon right away!"

<b>

Shaking off my thoughts, I moved from the border into the country.

<b>

"Since it's big, I should be able to find it quickly, right?"

<b>

I stood on top of the speeding car, looking around.

The car itself isn't necessary, but something like a magical carpet?

If I make a loud noise or kick up dust, it might come from over there, that's the plan.

<b>

"Hmm, sensing for a presence... maybe over there!"

<b>

My baseless intuition says so. Alright. Let's go, let's go!

As I was driving along a road near the forest, a monster that seemed completely unrelated to dragons appeared. A lion with a snake's tail. ...Chimera? Something like that? I'm not really sure.

For now, I'll swiftly cut off its head and collect it.

<b>

"Since we're at it, I hope a more delicious-looking monster shows up. Oh, by the way, are dragons tasty? Dragon steak sounds romantic, doesn't it...?"

<b>

Dia-kun and Aisia are in the car—rather, modifying the car at the base, so I'm just talking to myself.

<b>

Huh? If they're modifying the car, then what is this car?

It's a backup replica. It's common sense to have a backup when making modifications.

I mean, it's not like it's a legendary holy sword; it's only natural to have a spare for important tools. It's easy to duplicate with magic, after all.

<b>

While speeding along, I spotted a large snake and decided to hunt it as well. These kinds of things can be delicious when opened and grilled, like eel. Kabayaki... shirayaki could work too.

Huh? Oh no, there's a cut on my face. Was it someone else's prey? I accidentally hit it sideways. I should get out of here quickly.

<b>

"Still, where's the dragon? Hey, dragon... oh?"

<b>

I spotted a large creature running towards me from the direction I was heading.

A lizard... a big lizard? No! An iguana! Could it be the dragon I'm looking for!?

<b>

...But upon closer inspection, it was pulling a covered wagon. It seems to be some kind of riding beast. What a shame. Just as we passed each other, the desperate-looking driver called out to me.

<b>

"Hey, run! There's a dragon behind you!!"

"What, seriously?"

<b>

At the succinctly delivered situation, I couldn't help but smile.

Yes! I found it.

Indeed, further back, I spotted a yellowish enemy shadow. It was clearly a "dragon!"—a cool dragon with wings on its back was approaching in low flight.

<b>

I'm grateful for the luck of finding it more easily than I expected!

...Huh? Normally, you would lament the misfortune of encountering a dragon, right?

I don't know about that! I'm Karina-chan, the strongest, invincible beautiful girl!

<b>

"I'm going straight in and knocking it out with a right straight! Here I go!"

<b>

I charged at the dragon while still in the car, delivering a right straight to its face.

My right arm, protected by spatial magic, mercilessly smashed into the dragon's face, breaking its fangs.
