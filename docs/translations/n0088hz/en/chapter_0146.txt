# Something seems wrong with ......?

Welcome to Tessin. I don't know how much ...... skill you have, but don't die."

Don't worry, I won't die. I'm strong!"

<blank>

We were escorted into the country by a dwarf immigration officer.

I hear there's a Thunder Dragon in the country down the road: ...... I'm looking forward to it!　There's even a "whatever" reward for you, Deere: ...... julius.

<blank>

Ha. No, Dear, you are an ornamental beauty. She's an ornamental beauty!

I tend to inadvertently forget these days, but I am a man, for a change!

Should we just take a bath together in this "whatever" and visually check Deere's Deere and make sure he is a man?

They even dress up as men, so I'll have to remember that. ...... Yeah.

<blank>

I don't know, I just don't know what to do.　Dear, you dress up as a man so that I don't forget that you are a man, and it seems strange that I would be conscious of that. ......?　...... Hmm. What?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, well, well, so let's go slay some dragons right away!"

<blank>

We regained our composure and proceeded from the border into the country.

<blank>

It's so big, do you think they'll find it easily?"

<blank>

and scurrying around, standing gnarled on top of the car that is blasting away.

The car itself is fine without it, but a magic carpet?

There is also the calculation that if you make a loud noise or a cloud of dust, they might come from that direction.

<blank>

"Hmmm, look for signs ...... over there!"

<blank>

My unfounded hunch says so. All right. Let's go, let's go, let's go!

And as I was driving along a road near the forest, a monster appeared that seemed to have nothing to do with dragons. It's a lion with a snake tail. ...... chimera?　What is it?　I'm not sure.

For now, we'll just drop the head in a sputter and collect it.

<blank>

I wonder if there will be more tasty monsters out there. Oh, yeah, do dragons taste good?　Dragon steaks are so romantic. ......"

<blank>

Dear, you and Isiah are in the car - or rather, you are talking to yourself as you are modifying the car at the base.

<blank>

Hmm?　If you're modifying a car, what's this car?

It's a backup duplicate. It's common sense to keep backups if you're going to renovate.

I mean, it's not like it's a legendary holy sword, and it's only natural to have a spare set of important tools. It's easy to increase the number of them with magic.

<blank>

I saw a big snake and hunted it while I was running. I opened it up and grilled it, and it tasted like an eel. Kabayaki...... is also possible.

Hmm?　Oh, yikes. There's a cut on my face. I must have been someone's prey... I hit the side of my head. Let's get the hell out of here.

<blank>

'Even so, where's the dragon? Oi dragon or yi......o?"

<blank>

We found a large creature running toward us from the direction of travel.

Lizards...... big lizards?　Nope!　Iguana!　If it's the dragon you're after!

<blank>

I thought it was ......, but upon closer inspection, I saw that it was pulling a covered wagon. It looks like some kind of cavalry or something like that. Too bad. As I passed him, I was accosted by a desperate-looking man.

<blank>

Hey, run!　Dragon behind you!

Yeah, seriously?"

<blank>

The situation, as briefly announced to me, made me chuckle.

I did it. I found it.

Indeed, further back, we see an ochre-colored enemy shadow. This one was clearly a "dragon! was a cool-looking dragon with wings on its back, flying low and closing in on us.

<blank>

Thank my lucky stars I found it easier than I thought!

...... What?　You mean, they usually lament their misfortune of meeting a dragon?

I don't know!　I'm Kalina, the strongest, invincible, beautiful girl!

<blank>

I'm going to go straight to the front and smash it, straight right to the front and smash it!　Teiii!"

<blank>

I charge at the dragon with my car and slam a straight right into its face.

The right arm, protected by spatial magic, hit the dragon mercilessly in the face, breaking a fang.
