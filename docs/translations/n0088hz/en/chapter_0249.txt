# Are you taking a break here?

<b>

I was pretending to sleep, while Dia-kun and Misha were actually sleeping, along with Arthur.

When it came down to it, I would help… but the village chief and Youki arrived.

<b>

“...Excuse me. Oh? Everyone, are you taking a break here?”

“Oh my, if you sleep here, you might catch a cold. Let’s carry you to the bedroom.”

“Wait, Youki, it would be rude to take them to the bedroom of this mansion. But we can’t just open that box ourselves either. Let’s carry them to the ritual hall. Fortunately, it’s all women here.”

<b>

The two said that without hesitation.

Then, the village chief carried Arthur, while the other three, including me, were carried by Youki and a girl who looked like a maid.

The demon tribe woman seemed strong enough, easily carrying her load. I was also effortlessly carried by the maid. It seemed like Dia-kun was in Youki-chan's care.

<b>

...Since I was pretending to sleep, I thought I should mumble something in my sleep, but when Misha said, “Munya munya, uhm, I can’t eat anymore... no, I will eat!… Munya,” I was poked in the rear, so I decided against it.

<b>

By the way, I wonder what this consideration for the genders is about. What? What kind of scheme is this?

Ah. Speaking of which, they did say that the sacrifice must be a pure maiden or something like that, so is this that kind of thing?

<b>

“Still, it’s surprising that the shrine maiden and her party are all taking a nap together.”

“Yes, indeed. It’s almost as if they were drugged or something.”

<b>

When Youki-chan said that, the village chief’s expression changed.

<b>

“...Hey, wait, Youki. You were in charge of breakfast this morning, right?”

“No. Uncle Tenshiki insisted on hosting the shrine maiden, so we switched. It seems he finally decided to work seriously.”

“Idiot! Don’t let that bastard Tenshiki make anything that goes into the shrine maiden’s mouth! This could really be drugged; hurry to the ritual hall!”

<b>

Huh? Wait, things are starting to take a turn here. Could it be that those waiting ahead are connected to that Uncle Tenshiki? (I’ve already detected the ambush with spatial magic.)

<b>

Then I’ll just bind them and keep them down. Here we go.

<b>

“Hmm? It feels like the pressure has disappeared.”

“Could it be the shrine maiden’s divine power?”

<b>

Well, it’s probably that, most likely that! 

<b>

“Let’s hurry while we can, Youki.”

“Yes. But, will it be safe in the ritual hall?”

“It should be safe in the ritual hall. Only women are allowed in there.”

“That’s right! Ah, what about the dragon?”

“Only humans can’t enter; the dragon is fine. So, since I can’t enter, I’ll leave the dragon to you from here on.”

“Yes, Father.”

<b>

...Oh dear. Doesn’t this mean Dia-kun can’t enter either?

Well, if it gets found out, it gets found out. I’ll just say it was necessary to dress like a girl to be a shrine maiden or something like that!

<b>

<b>

So, with that, we headed towards the ritual hall. It was actually quite close, and there was a vermilion torii gate standing there. This must be the way to the ritual hall.

<b>

“I’ll stop here. The rest is up to you!”

“Yes, Father. Everyone, let’s keep going a little longer!”

<b>

As the maid carried me on her back, she stepped through the torii gate first.

I felt a sensation like passing through a membrane of water.

<b>

This is spatial magic, a barrier. With spatial magic, I’m a pro, so I can tell almost immediately upon touching it. …It was a type of barrier that classifies targets and repels anyone who isn’t female.

However, if I coat Dia-kun with spatial magic, he should be able to pass through. It seems easy to deceive.
