# Are you resting in a place like this?

<blank>

Me pretending to be asleep, Mr. Dear and Misha who are sleeping stiffly, and Arthur.

If it comes down to it, ...... Richo and Yohki came to me as I would help them.

<blank>

Excuse me, "....... Oh?　Are you all resting here?"

Oh, you'll catch a cold sleeping here, won't you? Let's take him to the bedroom.

We can't open that box without permission. But we can't open that box without permission. Let's take it to the hall of rituals. Fortunately, they are all women.

<blank>

The two of them say so with a lot of enthusiasm.

Then Arthur was carried by the village head, and the other three, including myself, were carried on my back by Yohki and a girl who looked like a maid.

The women of the demon tribe seem to be strong enough and carry them lightly on their backs. The maid carried me on her back. Dia-kun seemed to be in charge of Yohki-chan.

<blank>

I thought I should say something in my sleep since ...... I was pretending to be asleep, but I said, "Mnya mnya, mmm, I can't eat anymore...... no I'm going to eat! ...... mnya," Misha said, and I had to stop because she was poking me in the butt to see if I was awake.

<blank>

I mean, what is it that gender is taken into account in one way or another? What?　What's the plan?

Ah. Well, you said that the sacrifice had to be a pure maiden, or something like that.

<blank>

But still, I can't believe the miko-sama's group all took a nap together."

I see. It's as if you were drugged.

<blank>

When Yohki said this, the satochi's complexion changed.

<blank>

...... "Hey, wait a minute, Yoki. You were on meal duty this morning, right?"

No," he said. Uncle Tenshiki took over because he really wanted to entertain the miko princess. So Uncle Tenshiki has finally decided to take his job seriously."

Bollocks!　Don't let that bastard Tenshiki make something that will go into the mouth of the priestess!　This thing might really be drugged, hurry to the ritual hall!"

<blank>

Hmm?　Hey, this is a bit of a cloudburst. Could it be that the person waiting ahead of us is one of Uncle Tenshiki's men? (We've already figured out who's lying in wait with spatial magic.)

<blank>

Then, I'll make them get down and stay down. I'll get them down.

<blank>

"Hmm?　There's something about the pressure.

Is it the divine power of the miko-sama?"

<blank>

Well, surely yes, probably yes. Probably yes!

<blank>

Let's hurry while we still can, Yoki."

Yes. But would it be okay in the Hall of Rituals?"

The ritual hall should be safe. Only girls are allowed there.

Yes, I do."　Oh, what about Master Dragon ......?"

"Only human beings can't enter. So I won't go in, and you're on your way."

Yes, Father.

<blank>

...... Oops. I guess this doesn't let you in either, Deere?

Well, when they found out, they found out. It was obligatory to dress up as a girl in order to be a priestess, or something like that!

<blank>

<blank>

So, we headed for the shrine of ritual implements. We were rather close to the shrine, and there was a vermilion-colored torii gate. It seems that the hall of ritual implements is just ahead.

<blank>

I'm done here. I'll take care of the rest!

Yes, Father. You all just hang in there a little longer!"

<blank>

And the lady-in-waiting, carrying me on her back, passed through the torii gate one step ahead of me.

I had the sensation of passing through a film of water.

<blank>

Is this spatial magic, warding? If it's spatial magic, I'm a pro at it, so I can already tell most of it by touch. The wards were of a type that categorized the ...... target and repelled all but the woman.

But this should be passable if we coat Dear with spatial magic. It would be easy to fool it.
