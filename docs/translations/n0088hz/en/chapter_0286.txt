# Maid Homunculus (3)

Kaoru attracts the attention of the maid homunculus. In her hand was a brown potion with the lid open.

Color-wise it looks like cocoa, but ...... what potion?

<blank>

'Well, well, well. Master, what are you going to do with that?"

Of course--this is how it's done!

<blank>

Kaoru gulps down a brown potion. As long as she drank it herself, it can't be poison, can it? ......

<blank>

G, haaaaaaah!"

<blank>

The magic power blows out from Kaoru's body.

<blank>

Oh, hey. What did you drink, Kaoru!"

The "Piece of the God of Chaos" - this maid's hidden trump card. It's a powerful buff potion. It distorts reason and makes the amount of magic virtually infinite for a little while. ......!"

The master is reckless, isn't he? It's a lethal substance that would kill a normal person if drunk. ...... Well, if you are the master of alchemy, you can handle a bottle or so.

I don't want to die yet, so a little recklessness is nothing!

<blank>

Then Kaoru kneaded the magic. His eyes glowed red.

<blank>

'Haaaaahhhh ...... Super Alchemy!　Dummy Core & Golem Generation!"

<blank>

A "whimper!　and the magic power of Kaoru and his surroundings gathered to a single point, becoming a glowing red crystal. The walls of the room gathered around it as if it were turning around, and a white golem - or rather, a golem girl - was generated. She was about the size of an elementary school student, with a head part in the style of a big hairpiece, black eyes, and two "00" eyes side by side on an electric light display. She is a cute mecha girl.

<blank>

Why the girlish appearance - maybe it's a hobby. Also, a golem that you can ride in is not maneuverable in a small place like a room, or something like that.

I'm sure the school backpack on your back ...... has a proper function, right?　It's not just a hobby, is it?　It's cute, so I'll forgive it as a hobby.

<blank>

Hey, Kaoru, is that enough to beat that maid?"

He is indestructible as long as I pour my magic power into him!　If I don't lose, I win!"

But that magic is only temporary, right?

"......"

<blank>

Hey. Don't tell me you didn't think anything about endurance warfare?　Are you stupid?

<blank>

Yes, temporary or not, this Golem's strength is real!　I can't even rewrite this thing without showing more magical power than I have!　Golem!　Golem!

<blank>

The golem girl's eyes glow red with a gleam and she charges at the maid homunculus.

<blank>

It's definitely tricky. ......, but it's a godsend--"

"Beep--'Divine Seal' in effect."

<blank>

The school bag on the golem girl's back opens, and with a ba-humph, metal powder is scattered. It was like a chaff - and just as I thought that, my vision shook.

<blank>

Haha!　Now you're as good as just a maid!　You win! ...... Hey, Karina?　What's up?"

"Nggu, choma, me too, my body is heavy. ......?"

I'm sorry. Did you use a sacred tool over there, too!"

Oh, yikes. ......."

<blank>

Kaoru apologizes apologetically. But my consciousness is turning blacker and blacker.

<blank>

--Oh, yeah, well, my body is a 'God-made body'. ......

<blank>

Karina, are you okay?

<blank>

Misha does not seem to be affected and seems fine.

<blank>

"Misha, protect me, please. ......"

What?　This is where I come in!　Seriously?

<blank>

And with that last instruction, I lost consciousness as it was.

<blank>

(I was eating corona!

Well, that said, I've made it possible to drop a new toy tool in the supporters-only article in Kakuyom's recent status notebook...!

It's a tool that counts your keystrokes as you work on the keyboard and measures whether you're hitting your quota or not. It might be useful to use ...... as a companion for writing and so on.

(Well, it's a toy!)
