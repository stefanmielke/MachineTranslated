# Maid Homunculus (3)

Kaoru catches the attention of the maid homunculus. In her hand, she clutches a brown potion with the lid open.

It looks like cocoa in color, but... what kind of potion is it?

<b>

"Oh my, oh my. Master, what do you plan to do with that?"

"Of course—like this!"

<b>

Kaoru takes a gulp of the brown potion. Since she drank it herself, it can't possibly be poison, right...?

<b>

"Ugh, haaaah!!"

<b>

Magic power bursts forth from Kaoru's body.

<b>

"Hey, what did you drink, Kaoru!?"

"'Fragment of the Chaos God'—this maid's hidden trump card. It's a powerful buff potion. It distorts reason and for a short time, the amount of magic power becomes virtually infinite...!"

"Really, you're being reckless, Master. That's a deadly substance for ordinary people to drink... Well, if it's you, the child of alchemy, one bottle should be fine."

"I don't want to die yet, so a little recklessness is nothing to me!"

<b>

Saying that, Kaoru begins to mold her magic power. Her eyes glow red.

<b>

"Haaaaah... Super Alchemy! Dummy Core & Golem Creation!!"

<b>

With a whoosh! The magic power around Kaoru gathers into a point, becoming a red, shining crystal. Then, the walls of the room bend and gather with a crack, and a white golem—no, a golem girl is generated. About the size of an elementary school student, with a bobbed hairstyle, her eyes are black, and her gaze displays "00" in a digital format. She's a cute mechanical girl.

<b>

Why does she have a girl-like appearance—probably just for fun. Also, in a confined space like this, a golem that you can ride would be difficult to handle, something like that.

The backpack on her back, shaped like a school bag... it must have some real function, right? It's not just a decorative hobby, is it? It's cute, so I might forgive it if it is.

<b>

"Hey Kaoru, can that thing beat that maid?"

"This one is immortal as long as I pour magic power into it! If it doesn't lose, it can win!"

"But that infinite magic power is only temporary, right?"

"…"

<b>

Hey. You’re not saying you didn't think about a prolonged battle, are you? Are you an idiot?

<b>

"I-It may be temporary, but the strength of this golem is real! If it doesn't show more magic power than me, I can't rewrite it! Go! Golem!!"

<b>

The golem girl’s eyes shine red, and she charges at the maid homunculus.

<b>

"Ugh, that's certainly troublesome... but the divine artifact—"

'Beep—"Divine Artifact Sealing" activated'

<b>

The golem girl's backpack opens, and with a puff, metallic powder scatters everywhere. It was like chaff—just as I thought that, my vision shook.

<b>

"Hah hah! Now you're just like an ordinary maid! We've won! ...Huh, Karina? What's wrong?"

"Ugh, wait, my body feels heavy...?"

"S-Sorry. Were you using a divine artifact too!?"

"Ugh, oh no..."

<b>

Kaoru apologizes with a look of regret. However, my consciousness is gradually darkening.

<b>

—Oh right, my body was made by 'God'...!

<b>

"Karina, are you okay!?"

<b>

Misha seems unaffected and looks energetic.

<b>

"Misha, please protect me..."

"What!? Is it my turn now!? Seriously!?"

<b>

With that last instruction, I lost consciousness just like that.

<b>

(I was hit by Corona!

Well, aside from that, I've made it possible to drop a new toy tool in the supporter-only article on Kakuyomu's recent notes...!

It's a tool that counts keystrokes when working on a keyboard to measure if you're achieving your quota. It could be useful for writing companions... maybe?

Well, it's just a toy!)
