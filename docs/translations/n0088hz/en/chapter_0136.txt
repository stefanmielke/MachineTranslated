# Who is the greatest and most important?

In the meantime, I'll let the guildmaster and Garoon know what's going on via the contact magic tool modo.

He said he succeeded in capturing five people who looked like the perpetrators alive.

<blank>

"It's a situation of -" he said. "And since I've fortified them with my magic, I won't let them die. I will hand them over to you at a later date."

I understand. The dungeon will be active for a while longer, so Mr. Healer and Mr. White should return once in three days as planned. I will receive them then.

<blank>

So, we decided to keep it and hand it over at a later date.

Until then, there is no problem at all if you throw them into a time-stopped storage space. Or rather, it has already been inserted.

<blank>

In addition, I will check one thing with Garoon.

<blank>

Yeah, we're going to talk to some of the culprits. We're going to have a little talk with them. We are thinking of ...... torture, etc., but that's not a problem, is it?　We're not sure if you'll have any problem with that, since without us it would have been impossible to capture them alive in the first place, so I don't think you have much say in the matter.

'Mmm. Well, he is certainly a man who wants to commit suicide. If we can interrogate them later, we can say that it doesn't matter if they are missing an eye or a limb.

<blank>

All right. I got your word.

Now the guild can't complain no matter how much they humiliate the culprits. Hee hee.

<blank>

<blank>

I end the communication. I also deactivated the healer.

<blank>

'Well, I'm surprised you even have a prison cell in your backpack.

I just made it. But, well, as long as I'm in it, I won't let it die."

I see. I'm not sure if I'll be able to make a room in a jiffy. ...... my friend is a hell of a guy."

<blank>

And it's a secret, but that room, you can stop time.

It's a mysterious wind, but in reality time is suspended unless I allow it.

<blank>

<blank>

And the survivors of the crime are going to be greatly 'shamed alive,' so please cooperate."

...... what are you talking about?"

<blank>

Mr. Masiello tilted his head at me with a straight face.

Well, I don't know what I'm talking about either.

<blank>

But we can't help it, God demands socks with a sense of shame!

<blank>

<blank>

I've got a little situation. If I explain it to you, I'll be taking on the darkness of the world (the secret of God's proclivities), are you ready for that?"

I'll cooperate with you as much as I can. I'll cooperate with you as much as you want.

<blank>

Thank God. Mr. Masiello is a good man.

<blank>

I'm going to ask Masiello to give me a lot of personal information about the criminals," he said. You know, he seemed to know them.

"Uh, I know your name and stuff, but I don't know much about you, okay?"

Enough is enough. As long as we can humiliate the culprit!"

<blank>

I got a verbal commitment from the guild to do whatever I want to the culprits. That's enough.

I am prepared to listen to anything they complain about later.

<blank>

And look. God and the Adventurers Guild Master ...... or even the country.

Who is the greatest and most important?

<blank>

Of course, you know the answer.

<blank>

After that, nothing special happened after the new moon, and when the color of the dungeon core returned to black, the guildmaster contacted us with a communication magic modem and we had to pull out.

<blank>

After all, it was just that one raid, and that was the end of the job. That didn't take long.

I had a blast, it was like a training camp with Mr. Masiello!"

<blank>

In fact, in my opinion, that is the main thing.

Dungeon core escort?　If you put spatial magic on the core, it will be the strongest and invincible.

Even enemies can be dealt with in one shot by spatial magic. It's easy.

<blank>

It means that they knew from the beginning that it was an easy job.

<blank>

<blank>

Then let's give the culprit a great living shame!　Hee-hee-hee!"

You've done all that and you still haven't done enough."

<blank>

As Mr. Masiello said, I had been chastising and humiliating the culprits during my stay.

Because there were no additional attacks from the enemy and I was free. I mean, even Masilo-san cooperated with us.

<blank>

Well, it's still not enough, you know!

In fact, the leader of the group committed more crimes while in custody, so there is not enough to go around!

Solidarity of leaders!

<blank>

What are you talking about, we're just getting started!"

"Oh, ...... yeah. I feel a little sorry for those guys."

<blank>

Mr. Masiello shrugged his shoulders in disappointment.
