# Who is the most important and powerful?

<b>

For now, I will inform the guild master, Garoon, about the situation through a makeshift communication magic tool.

We have successfully captured five individuals who seem to be the culprits.

<b>

"---That's the situation. Since they are bound by my magic, they won't die. These guys will be handed over later."

"I understand. The dungeon will remain active for a while longer, so please have the healer and Shirogane return once in three days as planned. We'll receive them then."

<b>

So, it has been decided to keep them and hand them over later.

Until then, there will be no problem if I just toss them into a time-stopped storage space. In fact, they are already thrown in.

<b>

By the way, I confirm something with Garoon.

<b>

"Ah, we also intend to have a bit of a chat with the culprits. ...I am considering torture as well, but that won't be a problem, right? After all, it would have been impossible to capture them without my presence, so I believe you have almost no decision-making power in this matter."

"Hmm. Well, indeed, they are the type to want to take their own lives. If we can interrogate them later, then losing their eyes or limbs won't be an issue, let's say."

<b>

Alright. I've got that on record.

Now, no matter how much I humiliate the culprits, the guild can't complain. Hehehe.

<b>

<b>

I finish the communication. I also release the healer's form.

<b>

"Wow, I was surprised to find a prison inside your backpack."

"I just made it, though. But as long as they're inside, they won't die."

"Oh, right. You can just whip up a room like that. ...My friend is something else."

<b>

And it's a secret, but that room can stop time too.

While appearing solemn, in reality, time is stopped unless I give permission.

<b>

<b>

"So, I'll have the surviving culprits thoroughly experience 'living shame,' so please cooperate."

"…What are you talking about?"

<b>

Mashiro-san tilted her head with a serious expression.

Well, I also wonder what I'm saying.

<b>

But it can't be helped; the god is asking for socks filled with shame!!!

<b>

<b>

"Well, there's a bit of a situation. If I explain, you'll have to bear the world's darkness (the secret of the god's preferences), but are you ready for that?"

"Yeah, I got it, no need to say more. I'll cooperate as much as you need."

<b>

I'm glad. Mashiro-san is a good person.

<b>

"I'll have Mashiro-san provide plenty of personal information about the culprits. You seemed to know them, after all."

"Ah, I know their names, but I don't have much useful information."

"That's more than enough. I just need to humiliate the culprits!"

<b>

I've already secured the guild's permission to do whatever I want to the culprits. That's sufficient.

Even if they complain later, I'm ready to ignore everything.

<b>

And look. The god and the adventurer guild master... or even the country is fine.

Who is the most important and powerful?

<b>

Of course, the answer is clear.

<b>

After that, nothing particularly happened even after the new moon passed, and when the dungeon core returned to a pitch-black color, we received a communication from the guild master through the makeshift communication magic tool, and we decided to withdraw.

<b>

"In the end, it seems the only attack was that one time, so the job is finished. That was anticlimactic."

"I had fun; it felt like a training camp with Mashiro-san!"

<b>

For me, that was the main event.

Guarding the dungeon core? As long as I cast spatial magic on the core, it's invincible.

I can handle enemies with spatial magic in one hit. It's easy.

<b>

I knew from the start that it would be an easy job.

<b>

<b>

"Well then, shall I have the culprits experience a grand living shame? Hehehe."

"Are you still not satisfied after all that?"

<b>

As Mashiro-san said, I had been poking and humiliating the culprits during my stay.

After all, there were no additional attacks from enemies, and I was bored. Plus, Mashiro-san cooperated too.

<b>

Well, it's still not enough!

In fact, the leader committed even more sins while being restrained, so it's even less enough!!

The leader bears joint responsibility!!!

<b>

"What are you talking about? The real show is just beginning!"

"Ah... yeah. I feel a bit sorry for them."

<b>

Mashiro-san shrugged her shoulders with a sigh.
