# It's just a safety device

<b>

The dragon's name has been decided as Arthur.

It seems to be a name of a past hero. It sounds like Pendragon to me, but I wonder if it's been translated that way? Well, whatever.

<b>

"Good to have a nice name, Arthur-kun."

"Wow, thanks! By the way, Dia-kun is so cute! When I let him ride on my back, he was overjoyed!"

"After all, boys like dragons and stuff. They're strong and cool."

"Hahaha, I can't compete with you, sis... Wait, boy? Huh? Dia-kun is a male! I can't tell!"

<b>

Arthur-kun did a double take at Dia-kun.

<b>

"By the way, if I had named him, the next candidate would have been Tama. So be sure to thank Dia-kun."

"Got it! Dia-kun, thanks a lot!!"

<b>

Arthur-kun opened the vocabulary book to the page for "thank you" and waved it around toward Dia-kun.

He seems genuinely happy. Yes, yes, that's good.

<b>

"Ah, I'm starting to feel like I could handle Dia-kun being male. It's way better than a carriage, and I want to ride on his tail."

"If you lay a hand on Dia-kun, dinner will be a dragon heart sashimi, you know?"

"Yikes! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! There's no way I'd take sis's partner! Just a cute pet's nonsense!"

<b>

N-no, it's not a partner. Not in that sense.

As I was feeling a bit embarrassed, Mashiro-san, who had just finished her bath, called out to me.

<b>

"Hey Karina, what is Arthur saying?"

"Just some casual chat... Is everything okay, Mashiro-san? You seemed really on guard just a moment ago."

"Of course! It's a dragon, a dragon! Think about common senseâ€”oh, but saying that to you is pointless now. Haa..."

<b>

What the heck, as if I lack common sense. Well, that's true.

<b>

"Oh, right. Aren't we about to arrive at Rosetta Town? Don't let him out in the middle of town."

"Ah, umm. We probably need to show our faces at the gate, so maybe we should tie him up at the beast parking area?"

"Eh, I want to follow sis!"

<b>

Arthur-kun opened the vocabulary book to the page for "dissatisfaction" and held it up.

Don't say such unreasonable things; you're a dragon, you know.

<b>

"It's unfair that a more dangerous sis can enter normally!"

"Can't you transform into a human or something? Like, some kind of magic?"

"Not really. Well, there are dragons that have had children with humans, so maybe that's where the rumor comes from? ...Ah, but maybe the Fafnir faction could do it."

<b>

It seems to be a faction of dragons that loves to explore magic and curses.

However, it seems certain that Arthur-kun cannot transform into a human.

<b>

"Well, you would definitely stand out, so you can't walk around town. Or do you want to be a spectacle and parade around?"

"Ah, but I do have a skill for shrinking! I can get down to the size of a wolf, so that should work!"

"Oh, really? Give it a try."

"Got it! Shrinking!"

<b>

Arthur-kun shrank down with a pop. Originally the size of a carriage, he is now about the size of a medium dog.

And the vocabulary book fell to the floor with a thud. It seems that shrinking only applies to the main body.

<b>

"With this, I guess I can barely walk around with you? We should probably put a collar on you to make you look more like a pet."

"Oh, that's nice, it gives off a familiar vibe. And at least register as a tamer, okay? Even as a healer would be fine."

"I won't run away even without a collar, you know?"

"Huh? What are you saying, Arthur-kun? This is just a safety device that will choke you to death if you revert to your original size on your own."

"Geez!? Sis, you're ruthless! But that's what makes it wonderful!"

<b>

If you're confident wearing this, I might allow you to accompany me. Of course, only if I get permission to take you through the gate.

When I conveyed that, Arthur-kun accepted the collar quite readily.
