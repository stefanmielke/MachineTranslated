# It's just a safety device.

The dragon's name was decided to be Arthur.

It seems to be the name of some past hero. It sounds like Pendragon to me, but I wonder if this is a translation?　Oh well.

<blank>

I'm glad you got a good name, Arthur.

I'm so glad to see you here!　By the way, Dia-kun is so cute!　He was so happy when I put him on my back!

Boys like dragons, don't they? They're strong and cool."

'Ha ha ha, I'm no match for Miss. ...... is a boy?　What?　Dia-kun, are you a male?　I can't see!

<blank>

Mr. Arthur looked twice at Mr. Dear.

<blank>

'By the way, if I had put it on, the next candidate would have been Tama. Be thankful for that, Deere."

I'm so glad you're here!　Dia-kun-chan, ahazoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

Arthur opens the "Thank you" page of his vocabulary book and waves it at Dear.

You're happy with your heart. Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

<blank>

I'm starting to think that Dia-kun could be a male. I'd rather have you straddling my tail than a horse-drawn carriage.

If you mess with Mr. Dear, I'm going to have to make you a live dragonheart for dinner.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　There's no way I'm going to take your tugai!　It's just a cute pet!

<blank>

No, no, it's not a tsugai. That's not what I meant.

When I was somewhat embarrassed, Masilo-san approached me after his bath.

<blank>

Hey Karina, what did Arthur say?"

'It's just a nothing chat. ...... Are you okay, Masilo?　You seemed very guarded earlier."

Of course not, they're dragons!　Think of common sense - and I'm telling you, it's a little late for that. Huh."

<blank>

What the heck, like I have no common sense. You're right.

<blank>

Oh, yeah. Aren't we about to get to Rosetta town?　Don't let him out in town."

I'm not sure. I guess I need to show my face at the gate, so I guess I'll just hook up with the cavalry yard?"

I want to follow her.

<blank>

Arthur holds up the "Complaints" page of his vocabulary book.

Don't be absurd, you're a dragon.

<blank>

It's not fair that Miss Dragon, who is more boisterous than a dragon, is allowed to enter!

Can't you just turn into a person or something?　That kind of magic?"

I don't think so. I'm sure there are dragons that have had children with ningen, so maybe it's just a hoax. ...... ah, maybe if it's the Fafnir faction.

<blank>

It seems that the dragon faction loves to explore magic and curses.

But at least it seems certain that Mr. Arthur can't transform into a person.

<blank>

I'm sure they'll stand out, and I won't be able to take them around town. Or should we make a spectacle of him and parade him around?"

I have the skill to downsize!　I can be as big as a wolf, so I can do something with that!

'Oh, really?　Just give it a try."

Upsizing!"

<blank>

Arthur, who is smaller than Shupon. Whereas the original was the size of a carriage, he is now about the size of a medium-sized dog.

And the wordbook fell to the floor with a plop. It seems that miniaturization is only effective for the main unit.

<blank>

I thought to myself, "Well, I guess I can just barely walk around with it.　I'll put a collar on him like a pet.

'Oh, that's great, it makes you look like a follower. Or at least register as a tamer, right?　Or even as a healer."

I wouldn't run away without a collar, would I?

Hmm?"　What are you talking about, Arthur? This is just a safety device that will choke you to death if you return to your original size.

Geez!　Miss, you are so merciless!　But that's the beauty of it!

<blank>

If you are confident enough to wear this, well, I'll be happy to allow you to accompany me. Of course, only if you get permission to take me to the gate.

When I told him this, Arthur accepted the collar rather openly.
