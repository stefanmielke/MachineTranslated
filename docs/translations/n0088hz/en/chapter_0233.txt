# Victory Declaration

<b>

<b>

It was an unprecedentedly fierce battle.

In the final match, the one who claimed victory was――me!!

<b>

“Haah, haah... that was close...!”

“Grrr, if only you had been banned from wearing a helmet with magic one match earlier...”

“Well, even so, I had the ring on my arm, so in terms of victory, I was ahead.”

<b>

Moreover, various prohibitions were added to the rules, and in the end, it turned into a normal game of hitting and wearing a helmet while playing rock-paper-scissors.

<b>

...A referee who could read the audience's reactions appeared to prevent Misha from cheating. I couldn't just secretly use magic, could I? I used it until it was banned by the added rules.

(Note: The additional referee was General Garou, who was passing by in a mask. Is he bored?)

<b>

<b>

Misha hid her groin with her tail, covered her chest with her left arm, and offered me her last piece, her pantyhose.

In response, I hid my chest with my hair, remained panty-less with just a petticoat, and while hiding the line of my butt with my left hand, I received the warm pantyhose with my right hand.

<b>

“I got itーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー！！！！！"

<b>

I raised the pantyhose and declared victory.

<b>

“The champion is Karinaaaaaaーーーーーーーー！！！ Let’s give a big round of applause to both competitors who fought an unprecedentedly heated battle!! Also, where can I go to request you?”

“It’s not for sale!!! What a shame!!!”

“Eh?! That’s so unreasonable!!”

<b>

I picked up my discarded clothes and hurried back to the player’s seat.

<b>

“Dia-kun, I won!!”

“C-Congratulations... ah, um, please put your clothes on quickly! Your clothes!”

“Oh, sorry, sorry.”

<b>

Dia-kun’s face turned bright red as he flustered. He hid his face with his hands but peeked through his fingers... not looking! What?! If it were me, I would definitely be looking!

<b>

I put my clothes back on.

<b>

“Um, now that the tournament is over, can I wear my clothes too? I can’t put them on by myself.”

“Oh, right. I mean, it’s really honest of you to be so diligent about undressing until the tournament was over.”

“Well, that was the rule...”

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, Dia-kun returned to his gothic lolita dress appearance.

...Phew, I’m relieved, but does he really understand that he looks cute in his dressed-up appearance? He’s already completely a girl...!

<b>

Since I got my fight money, maybe I’ll buy Dia-kun some accessories... or maybe it’s better to buy some gems that could be used as materials and have everyone from the Five Elder Lords process them?

The labor cost will be at actual expense, and the technical fee will be paid in bed!

<b>

“Ughhh... I can’t get married anymore!! It’s all your fault, Karina!”

“Eh? It was Misha who invited me to the tournament. Isn’t that just desserts?”

“If you had just lost quietly, it would have been fine! I didn’t want to fight, I just wanted revenge on you!!”

<b>

Well, I felt embarrassed enough this time, so I think I managed to get my revenge properly.

<b>

“Ah, Karina-chan. Delivery, delivery! And bring Misha-chan with you! I have something I want to investigate.”

<b>

Huh?... Huh? What does she want to investigate...

<b>

“...Ah, um. Misha, can you come over? I have something to discuss.”

“Eh, I don’t really want to...”

“Well, I received a telepathic message that I can’t refuse... no, a divine revelation... or something?”

“...Huh??? Hey, stop joking. If you deceive a god, divine punishment will occur, you know? I heard that a country recently perished because of that.”

<b>

It’s okay, it’s okay, I’m the real deal.
