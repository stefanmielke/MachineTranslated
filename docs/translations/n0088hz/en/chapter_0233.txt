# Declaration of Victory

<blank>

<blank>

It was the fiercest battle ever fought.

Finals. The winner - it was me!

<blank>

Ha, ha ...... that was a bad ......!"

If only it had been banned for one more battle earlier, you'd be wearing a helmet with magic. ......

Well, I still had the ring on my arm, so I was the winner.

<blank>

The rules were changed to a regular game of "tapping, covering, and rock-paper-scissors" after various prohibitions were added.

<blank>

I've seen judges who can see through the audience to block ...... Misha's post-movement. I can't use magic in secret either, can I?　I used to use it until they added a rule banning it.

(And the additional referee was a passing, masked General Garou. Are you busy?)

<blank>

<blank>

Misha hides his crotch with his tail, his chest with his left arm, and takes off his pantyhose, the last one, and offers it to me.

In contrast, I, too, cover my breasts with my hair, leave one pannier with no panties, and receive a pair of hovering pantyhose with my right hand while hiding my buttocks with my left hand.

<blank>

"I got it!!! ！！！！！"

<blank>

He held up his pantyhose and declared victory.

<blank>

The winner is Carina!　A big round of applause to both players for an unprecedentedly hot competition!　Now where else can I nominate you?"

'It's not for sale!　Too bad!!!!"

I'm so sorry!　Such an outrage!"

<blank>

I picked up my own clothes, which I had taken off, held them in my arms, and hurriedly returned to the players' seats.

<blank>

Deere, you won!"

I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get dressed soon!　Clothes!

Oops, sorry, sorry.

<blank>

Dia-kun's face turns bright red and gasps. He is not looking ...... through the gap between his fingers while hiding his face with his hand!　What the hell!　I'd definitely be looking at that stew!

<blank>

And then, I put my clothes back on.

<blank>

...... Um, now that the convention is over, can I put my clothes on too?　I can't wear it alone."

I mean, you're really faithful to take off your clothes until the end of the tournament. I mean, you're really sincere about taking off the law until the tournament is over."

Because that was the rule. ......

<blank>

With a snap of his fingers, Dear-kun returned to his gothic lolita dress.

You're relieved that you're ...... phew, but do you realize that you're dressed up in a cute little girl's outfit?　You are already a girl. ......

<blank>

Now that I got the fight money, I think I'll buy some accessories for Mr. Dear. ...... No, I think I'll buy some gems that could be used as materials and have them processed by all the Five Elders.

I'll pay the actual cost of the labor, and I'll pay for the technical fee on the bed!

<blank>

"Unyaaaaa...... can't be a bride anymore!　It's your fault, Carina!

What? You invited Misha to the convention. You deserved it, didn't you?"

I wish you had just lost!　I didn't want to fight, I just wanted revenge on you!

<blank>

Well, this time I was embarrassed enough, and I think I got my proper revenge for that.

<blank>

'Oh, Karina. Delivery, delivery!　And bring Misha with you!　I need to check something.

<blank>

What? What is it that you want to check out ...... Eh?　What is it that you want to find out? ......

<blank>

"...... Uh, you know. Misha, can you come over for a minute so we can talk?"

"Well, I don't like it."

"Well, I got a reminder from a source I can't refuse: ...... or is it an oracle ......?"

What about "......?　Don't make jokes. If you cheat God, you will be punished by God.　I heard that recently a country was destroyed because of it.

<blank>

Don't worry, don't worry, we are the real deal.
