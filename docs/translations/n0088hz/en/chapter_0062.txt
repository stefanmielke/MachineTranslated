I am Karina-chan!

I came to the lord's castle with my friend Dia-chan! Holding hands and happily strolling around the grounds!

I wonder where our destination is? Led by my aunt, we keep walking deeper inside.

<b>

"Well, I must say, I can't believe Maria was the former lord's wife. We should thank God for this coincidence!"

"Absolutely. We had no idea that Karii-chan was such an amazing magician. Where did she train?"

"Hmm, over that way?"

<b>

As we chat, we head towards the detached house where the former lord's wife, Maria, lives. It's the place we infiltrated the day before yesterday.

It's quite spacious when walking. I didn't notice it before since we teleported.

After about ten minutes of walking, we arrive at the reception room.

<b>

"Alright, we've arrived. From here on, it's work mode for Auntie."

"Okay! Oh, should I also be formal?"

"Karii-chan can stay as she is. You're a friend of Maria, the master here, and an important guest. --Excuse me, Maria Belle-sama. I've brought a guest."

<b>

Auntie in work mode has such a beautiful voice. It reminds me of my mom when she answers the phone.

As I think that, the door opens.

<b>

Inside, there was a silver-haired elf. She looks like a perfect example of what Dia-kun would become if he grew up as a girl, a lovely elf.

<b>

Seeing that, Dia-kun tightly grasped my hand and then gently let go.

<b>

He stepped forward, facing the older sister with a serious expression.

Then he placed his hand on his chest and gave a slight bow.

<b>

"…Sister. I'm so glad to see you safe."

"Eh!? Di!? Is that you!? Why are you dressed so adorably!?"

"Eh? Ah…"

<b>

It seems Dia-kun just remembered how he was dressed. His elf ears turned completely red. He's completely frozen right now. I poke his cheek. It's so squishy.

<b>

Maria, dressed in a dress as the former lord's wife, looks at me with a puzzled expression and speaks.

<b>

"Hey, Karii-chan. What's going on here?"

"Eh? Isn't it super cute?"

"…Well, I certainly didn't realize he was a boy either."

"He looks like a girl from any angle. No kidding, isn't Dia cuter than me? Oh my, I didn't know there was such a world outside the country…!"

<b>

The older sister's eyes sparkle as she looks at Dia-kun. I can sense potential.

Meanwhile, Dia-kun has tears in his eyes, trembling, saying, "N-no, that's not it…!" This is the best. Just keep charging that embarrassment into your socks.

<b>

"Ah, I apologize for the delay. My name is Kumin. Thank you for helping my brother…? Thank you?"

"Thank you very much, I'm Karina. Your sister is super cute. Oh, Kumin-san, you're really beautiful too."

"I'm a boy, you know!"

<b>

We exchange introductions with Dia-kun, who is as cute as a puppy barking.

<b>

"So, Dia. Why are you dressed so adorably? Can you tell your sister?"

"Th-this is, um… Karina onee-san, please explain… ugh…"

<b>

Dia-kun crouches down, holding his face. It seems showing his boyish self to someone who knows him is very embarrassing.

<b>

"Um, well, that outfit was the result of Dia-chan choosing the clothes that suited him best, right? The underwear is for girls too. The socks are super cute and match perfectly, right? Dia-chan really knows how cute he is!"

"C-cute, ah, um, onee-san!? There’s a major omission in your explanation! No, sister! Karina onee-san said that if I wore cute clothes, she would help you!!"

<b>

Dia-kun stammers with tears in his eyes. Ah, so cute.

<b>

"By the way, I heard there was a perverted elf at the public bath the other day… could it be…"

"See, Dia-chan, you really should have gone to the girls' bath!!"

"That is absolutely not true, onee-san!! Um, sister! Please believe me! I'm not a pervert!"

<b>

Ah, so cute. The sensation of my brain tingling with pleasure. There's a nutrient that can only be obtained from seeing a boy in a dress blushing red when his family sees him for the first time.

<b>

Just as tears were about to spill from Dia-kun's eyes, Maria clapped her hands.

<b>

"Well, I think it's a very high-quality disguise. Right?"

<b>

Maria tries to wrap it up by saying to the older sister, "It was a disguise."

I see, that's a clever interpretation. The former lord's wife is no joke, Maria.

<b>

"Ah, yes, a disguise. Oh, so that's why you were dressed as a girl, Dia."

"Y-yes, that's right. This outfit was just to hide my identity, right? Right, Karina onee-san!?"

<b>

I guess I should ease up a bit. It would be too cruel to tease him too much, so let's leave it at this.

<b>

"I actually prefer that outfit… So, Dia-kun. You can change back now, okay? Here, this is the outfit you were wearing. I'm returning it."

"Ah, th-thank you."

<b>

I hand Dia-kun the clothes he was initially wearing. The socks have been secretly replaced with new ones as a little joke. I would like to offer the socks he wore as a boy to God.

<b>

"Well then, I'll go change."

"Eh? You can change here. If you're a boy, there's nothing to be embarrassed about, right?"

"…No, it's embarrassing."

"Then just return the socks first. That’s fine."

"Well, if it's just that…"

<b>

Dia-kun tries to take off his socks. However, the socks he is currently wearing are black over-the-knee socks. In other words, they are long socks that go up to his thighs. If he lifts his skirt to hook his hand, of course—he can see it, he can see it! Here it is!

<b>

"Dia-chan. Your panties are showing to the older sisters, you know?"

"Hyah!?"

<b>

At my words, Dia-kun reflexively held down his skirt. His face turned red again, trembling. So cute.

<b>

"Oh dear? What's wrong, Dia-chan? Feeling embarrassed that the inside of your skirt is being seen? How cute. Now, shall we continue?"

"U-uh… Onee-san, that's so mean…"

<b>

Dia-kun, just as I intended, carefully took off his knee socks while being engulfed in embarrassment, making sure the inside of his skirt couldn't be seen. He then headed to the next room with a change of clothes in hand.

… I immediately stored the freshly removed knee socks into my storage space.

<b>

The carefully nurtured fruit has finally been harvested.

God, did you see that!

<b>

"Great job! I promise you 100 SP for the boy's set! Plus, I'll give you a red ticket worth three times the assessment value. That makes it effectively 300 SP! Hooray!"

<b>

Oh, a direct message to my brain! … I wasn't wrong! Thanks to Dia-kun, I did it!

<b>

"Hey, what did we just witness?"

"I don't know, but there's no doubt that Dia was incredibly cute."

<b>

Kumin-san is grinning at the sight of her brother being humiliated.

I really think he has potential!
