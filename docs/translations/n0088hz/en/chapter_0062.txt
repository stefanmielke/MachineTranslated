I, Karina-chan!

I came to the lord's castle with my friend Dia!　We walked around the castle grounds, holding hands and getting along well with each other!

Where is our destination?　Obaachan will take me further and further back.

<blank>

'Oh no, and yet Old Lady Maria was the former wife of a former lord. I thank God for this coincidence.

We didn't know that Kari was such a great magician. We didn't know that you were such a great wizard. Where did you train?

Hmmm, over there?"

<blank>

While chatting, we were headed for the former wife of the former lord, Grandma Maria, who lives in a remote house. We infiltrated the place the day before yesterday.

I mean, it's a big place to walk around. I wasn't aware of it before because I was transitioning.

After walking for about 10 minutes, I came to the reception room.

<blank>

Well, here we are. Well, let's get to work from here, Obachan.

I'll be right with you. Oh, should I get all coy too?"

Kari, you can stay as you are. She is a friend of the owner of this place, Grandma Maria, and she is a very important guest. --Excuse me, Maria Belle. I have a guest for you.

<blank>

Obaachan in work mode, you have a beautiful voice. That's it, she sounds like a mother when she answers the phone.

With this in mind, the door opens.

<blank>

Inside was a silver-haired elf. She was a beautiful elf, a model of what Dia will become when she grows up as a girl.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Dia-kun, seeing this, squeezed my hand and then gently moved away.

<blank>

Step forward and give your sister a crisp look.

Then he put his hand on his chest and lightly bailed.

<blank>

"Dear ...... sister. I'm so glad you're safe.

What?　Dee!　It's Dee!　Why are you dressed so adorably!"

What?　Oh, ......."

<blank>

Dia-kun seems to remember what he was just dressed like. He is red to the tips of his elf ears. He is completely frozen. I pecked him on the cheek. It's so soft and soft.

<blank>

Old Maria, dressed as the former wife of a former lord, speaks to me with a puzzled look on her face.

<blank>

"Hey, Kari, what's going on? What's this all about?

What?　Isn't she super cute?"

......No, well, I certainly didn't realize it was a man either, this one."

I can't help but notice that you look like a girl. Oh, my God, isn't Dee prettier than me?　Oh my God. Such a world out there in the country. ......!"

<blank>

Your sister's eyes are kind of shining when she sees Dear-kun. I can feel her qualities.

On the other hand, Dia-kun has tears in the corner of his eyes and pulls "Chi, chi, no, it's different ......". Oh no, this is the best. Please keep charging your socks with shame.

<blank>

Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. My name is Kumin. I would like to thank you for helping my brother ......?　Thank you?"

This is Hi, I'm Karina. Your sister is super cute. Oh, and Ms. Kumin is also very beautiful."

I'm a man!

<blank>

We introduced ourselves to each other with Dia, who was as cute as a barking puppy.

<blank>

So, Dee. Why are you dressed so cute?　Tell me sister?"

"This is the ...... uh, sister Karina, please explain ...... uh ......."

<blank>

Dia-kun crouches down, holding her face. It seems that he is very embarrassed to show himself as a man's daughter to those who know him as a man.

<blank>

...... Well, as I recall, those clothes were the result of Deere's own choice of what clothes looked best on her, right?　And the underwear is girls', too. And the socks look great on you, too, and you're super cute, right?　You know how cute you are, don't you?

I'm sorry, but there's a serious omission in your explanation!　There is a serious omission in the explanation!　No, sister!　Sister Karina said she would help you if you put on a pretty dress!

<blank>

Dia-kun makes excuses with a gasp and teary eyes. Oh, he's so cute!

<blank>

I heard there was a lascivious elf in a public bathroom the other day. ...... No way."

'Look, Deere, I knew you should have gone in the women's bath!

'That is absolutely not true, sister!　Um, sister!　Believe me, I'm not a slut!　I'm not a slut!"

<blank>

Ah, lovely. The feeling of the brain marrow being moistened with zingy, numbing water. There are nutrients that can only be ingested by a man's daughter whose face is turning red when her relatives see her in women's clothing for the first time.

<blank>

Just as tears were about to fall from Dia's eyes, Old Maria clapped her hands.

<blank>

I think it's very perfect as a disguise. I think I'm very accomplished as a disguise. Right?"

<blank>

Old Maria turns the water on her sister to put it together by saying that it was a disguise.

Well, that's a good interpretation. The former wife of a former lord is no mean feat, Grandma Maria.

<blank>

'Ha, yes, a disguise. Oh, so that's why you were dressed as a girl, Dee."

Yes, that's right. This outfit is to hide yourself?　And, right, sister Karina?

<blank>

I can't help it. It's too sad to tease him too much, so I'll leave it at that.

<blank>

I like you better dressed that way. ...... Well then, Dear. You can change now, okay?　Here are the clothes you were wearing. I'll give it back to you."

Ah, thank you. Oh, thank you."

<blank>

I hand Dia the first outfit I wore. It is charming that only the socks are secretly replaced with new ones. I would like to offer them to God together with the socks I wore when I was a boy.

<blank>

Well, I'm going to go get changed."

What?　Why don't you just change your clothes here? As a boy, there's nothing to be embarrassed about, right?"

...... No. It's embarrassing, right?"

Then just give me back my socks first. That's fine."

If that's about it, well, ......

<blank>

And Deere-kun tries to take off his socks. However, the socks he is wearing now are black over-knee socks. In other words, they are long socks that go all the way up to her thighs. If you pull up your skirt and try to hook your hand in them, you will naturally see them...!　Here it is!

<blank>

Dia-chan, you're showing your pants to your sisters. Your sisters can see your pants, can't they?"

Hyaaaa!"

<blank>

Dia-kun reflexively held back his skirt at my words. His face turned bright red again and he was shaking with a pull. Cute.

<blank>

What's going on?　What's wrong, Dia-chan?　You're so cute that you're embarrassed to be seen in your skirt. Now, continue?"

"Ugh, ugh ...... your sister's so mean ......"

<blank>

Dia-kun, covered in shame as I had intended, took off his knee-socks, taking great care not to show the contents of his skirt. Then he grabbed a change of clothes and headed into the next room.

...... I immediately put away my freshly removed knee socks into storage space.

<blank>

The fruits of careful cultivation were finally harvested.

God, did you see it?

<blank>

The price is very reasonable!　Let's promise 100 SP for a set of before and after male daughters!　In addition, we will also give you a Red Ticket for 3 times the valuation. It's actually 300SP!　Huw!

<blank>

Oops, direct feedback to the brain! ...... I was not wrong!　Yay, Deere, you did it, Deere, you did it!

<blank>

Hey, what were we being shown?"

I don't know, but I'm sure Dee was very pretty."

<blank>

Mr. Kumin's mouth is smiling when he sees his brother being humiliated.

I still think you have the right qualities!
