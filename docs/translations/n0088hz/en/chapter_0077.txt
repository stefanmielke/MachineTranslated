# "Lending My Chest" (Physics) ● Illustrated

<b>

"Ah, ah... Can you make your voice a little higher?"

"Hmm, if I tweak my vocal cords here... How's this?"

"Ah, ah... Perfect, thank you, my lord!"

<b>

Tuning Aisia's throat. As a former bard, she seems to have her own preferences.

<b>

"... I can't predict what will happen if I don't check on you regularly, you know?"

"Yes. I will follow you for life, my lord."

"Yes, yes, serve me for life, Aisia. Good girl, good girl."

"Hehe, my lord."

<b>

Good, good. If she betrays me now, I can't predict what will happen to her throat. I can bind her to me by taking her precious throat as a hostage. Hehehe.

<b>

It seems her face needed almost no adjustments. She might have become a bit more beautiful than before.

Well, I used Sati-chan as a reference! Sati-chan is super cute, and my nostalgic bias is at play, so there's no way she wouldn't be cute!

<b>

"... Ah, but even dear Dia-kun isn't lacking in cuteness! Even when sulking, he's cute!"

"No, I'm not sulking...!"

<b>

You're sulking. Cute. Cute and good, abbreviated as "kawayo."

<b>

<b>

Moreover, she had been educated not to commit crimes.

It seems education included that sort of thing. If you don't educate them on this, even if you order them not to commit crimes, they often won't understand what constitutes a crime, so it won't be effective.

<b>

Well, it's impossible to make her memorize the entire legal code, so it’s limited to common sense, but at least she has some education, which is a relief.

<b>

"Please tell me when you dislike something. I'll still make you work, but if there's something that can be improved, we'll improve it."

"Yes. Thank you for your consideration, my lord."

<b>

Aisia bows her head politely. Yes, yes, she's obedient. Just as expected of a slave.

<b>

Ah, I need to create a room too.

I wonder where I should make it...

<b>

"Eh, are you giving me a room?"

"As you can see, there’s plenty of space, and I can create more as needed."

"I can serve you in your room at all times."

"Then it will be across from my room!"

<b>

I might bring her in for naughty things, but privacy and personal space are important too!!

It would be troublesome if she came over when I'm not in the mood...?

<b>

"Ah, I'll make it a spacious room so you can practice singing without hesitation."

"Thank you very much, my lord."

<b>

Well, since soundproofing is perfect, it doesn't need to be that spacious, but it doesn't need to be small either.

<b>

<b>

"... So, what will you have Aisia do? There’s no need for the usual slave work here, right?"

"Ah, yeah."

<b>

Typically, a slave would handle the chores around you. For example, boiling water for a bath and carrying it to the tub is a job for a slave. However, since space magic can handle all that, there’s no work for her.

I convey the idea I thought of when buying Aisia in response to Dia-kun's question.

<b>

"You'll be my substitute. I don’t want to be too famous, so I thought I'd make it seem like Aisia is responsible for this and that. Especially for healing-related things. I'll have her wear a mask, though."

"I see, so you’re going to make Aisia-san the 'mask' of Sister Karina."

"That's right. I have to pretend that Aisia was the one healed the first time, so I’ll wear the mask myself."

<b>

The name will be Damina Niseisha... No, I should have Dia-kun and the others come up with a more fitting name. My naming sense is lacking.

<b>

"That means Aisia-san's chest won't be enough. Are you going to use padding?"

"No, I’ll hide my chest here. Like this, and like this."

<b>

I slip my chest into space magic. From the outside, that is, looking from above the clothes, it appears completely flat. It's smaller than Aisia's, so it might be better to use padding instead.

<b>

"W-what!? The sister's chest disappeared...!?"

"Hehe, it's just stored in space magic. This way, it won't be noticed."

<b>

After all, it's easy to increase size with padding, but it's difficult to make something on the body disappear.

If I cut it off, it would be a hassle to heal. It hurts. ... This feels breezy.

<b>

"I was surprised... So you can do that too."

"Would you like me to lend you my chest, Dia-kun? Here."

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, I grow my breasts on Dia-kun's flat chest.

This is the secret technique of space magic, "Lending My Chest" (Physics)!!

<b>

Kyaa, a loli big-breasted elf! Even with my size, it looks big because the base is small!

And my breasts aren't cold! It's a good idea to leave them with Dia-kun when I need to hide them!

<b>

"Eh!? W-what, I have breasts!? W-wait, I can't see below!"

"Hyah!? Ah, w-wait, Dia-kun!"

<b>

Pafun, Dia-kun lifted my breasts from below to support them. Puny.

But those are my breasts, and they are firmly connected...!

Ah, no, touching them in a way that savors their softness is a no-go!

<b>

"Wow, they're so soft and warm... Wow..."

"Um, Dia-kun. Can I ask you something?"

"Yes, what is it?"

"Hyahn! Ah, um... That—"

<b>

<b>

"—... It's connected to me... Nnkuh."

"Eh? ... Ah! S-sorry!?"

<b>

Crap, phew, that was close. I almost awakened something.

It was my fault for forgetting that men have a tendency to "squeeze their breasts if they have them"!

Anyone would do that; I would do that too. I did. I do it every morning.

<b>

... Right, if I use the same method to separate Dia-kun's "Dia-kun," wouldn't it make him look more like a girl? I'll have to try that next time.

<b>

<b>

Later, upon further consultation, it turned out that there was no need to combine the introduction of the healer and Aisia's full recovery report, so there was no need to lend my chest to Dia-kun at all.
