'Uh-oh. ...... voice, can you raise it a little higher?"

"Hmm, how about you play with your vocal cords here ......?"

Oh, uh. ...... is perfect, thank you very much, Aruji-sama!"

<blank>

Tuning Isiah's throat. As a former minstrel, she seems to be very particular.

<blank>

......I need to see you regularly, otherwise I don't know what's going to happen, okay?"

Yes, I will follow you for the rest of my life. I will follow you for the rest of my life, Oji-sama."

I'm sure you'll serve me for the rest of your life, Isiah. Good luck."

"Heh heh, I am, sir."

<blank>

All right, all right. Now if you betray me, I don't know what will happen to your throat. You could hold your precious throat hostage and bind it to me. Hmph.

<blank>

And it seems that the face hardly needed any correction. I heard that she may have become a little more beautiful than the original.

Well, I used Sati as a reference!　Sati is super cute, and with my memory correction, how could she not be cute?

<blank>

...... Oh, Deere, you're not as cute as you look!　Even when you sulk, you're still cute."

No, I'm not sulking at .......

<blank>

You're sulking. Kayo. Cute and nice, Kayo for short.

<blank>

In addition, they were educated in the area of avoiding committing crimes.

They said that education included that kind of thing. If you don't educate people here, even if you order them not to commit a crime, they often don't know what a crime is and it is often ineffective.

<blank>

Well, it's impossible to make them memorize the entire Six Laws, so it's only common sense level, though there are some holes. Thank God I am educated.

<blank>

Tell me what you don't like. I'll still let you do your job, but I'll improve what I can.

Yes, sir. Thank you for your concern, my Lord."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Aisia bows her head with a bow. Yes, yes, she is obedient. As expected of a slave child.

<blank>

Oh, and we need to make room.

In the meantime, where shall we build it?

<blank>

"Oh, can I have the room?"

As you can see, there's plenty of room, and we can add as many as we want."

"You may serve me in your room at all times."

Then you're across the hall from me!

<blank>

I might bring them in and do erotic things with them, but apart from that, privacy and private life are important!

I don't want you to come when I'm not in the mood. ......?

<blank>

'Oh, I'll give you a bigger room so you can practice your singing without any worries.'

"Thank you, Mister."

<blank>

Well, it doesn't need to be that wide because it's perfectly soundproofed anyway, but it doesn't need to be small either.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... So, what do you have Isiah do?　The kind of work you normally make slaves do isn't really needed here."

Uh, yeah."

<blank>

Usually, slaves are given chores to do around them. For example, boiling water for a bath and carrying it to the bathtub is a job that slaves are required to do. However, since the space magic can do all of these things, there is no work to be done.

Dear, to your question, I'll tell you the idea I had in mind when I bought Isiah.

<blank>

She's my stand-in. I don't want to be too famous, so I'm going to make it all about Isiah. I don't want to be too famous, so I'm going to make it all about Isiah. I'll have her wear a mask or something.

I see, so you are going to make Ms. Isiah a 'mask' for your sister Karina."

'That's the thing. I have to pretend I fixed Isiah the first time, so I'm going to put a mask on him, though."

<blank>

The name is Damina Nisseisha...... or I'll let you and Dia come up with a more appropriate name. I'm not sure if I have a good sense of naming.

<blank>

'Well, then, Miss Isiah's breasts won't be enough. Are you going to make her stuff them?"

No, I'm going to cover my breasts here. Like this."

<blank>

The chest is pinched into the space magic. On the outside, i.e. on top of the clothes, it's completely flat. It's smaller than Isiah's. On the other hand, it might be better to stuff it.

<blank>

"Oh, your sister's breasts are gone ......!"

I just put it in my room with spatial magic. This way they won't know it's there."

<blank>

At any rate, it is easy to increase with fillings, but difficult to erase what is in the body.

And if you cut it off, it's a pain to fix. And it hurts. 

<blank>

I was surprised ...... that you could do that."

If you want, I can lend my chest to you, Dear.　Tei."

<blank>

I snap my fingers and let my boobs grow on Dear's flat chest.

This is the secret art of spatial magic, "lending chest" (physics)!

<blank>

Wow, loli big breasted elf!　Even in my size, she looks big-breasted when her foundation is petite!

And my boobs don't get cold!　I guess I'll leave them with you, Dear, when I have to hide my breasts!

<blank>

"Huh?　This, eh, I have boobs!　Wow, I can't see what's underneath."

"Hiyah!　Oh, wait, Dia-kun!

<blank>

With a "poof", Dia-kun lifted up her boobs as if supporting them from below. Puffing.

But that's my boobs, and they are firmly connected. ......

Oh, no, you can't touch it in a way that makes it squirm and enjoy its softness!

<blank>

"Eh, wow, soft and warm ...... wow ...... wow."

Oh, um, Deere. Do you have a minute?"

Yes, what is it?"

Hyan!　Oh, you know what? That--

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It's--...... connected to me. ...... nkk."

What?" ...... Oh!　I'm sorry!

<blank>

Damn, whew, that was close. I almost woke up something.

Now that's my fault for inadvertently forgetting that men have a 'habit of squeezing their own breasts if they have boobs. ......

Everybody does it, even I do it. I did. I do it every day when I wake up.

<blank>

...... Yes, wouldn't it be more girly if we detached Deer-kun's Deer-kun in this same way?　I'll try it next time.

<blank>

<blank>

Afterwards, when we discussed the matter again, we decided that it would be better if we didn't introduce a healer and report Aisia's complete recovery together, so there was no need for us to lend our chest to Mr. Deere.
