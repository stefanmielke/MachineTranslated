# The type of person who scatters the money in her purse at a cabaret and goes broke.

<blank>

Hey, should I call you stepmother?"

"Stop it.　That means I'm Isiah's grandmother.

Don't worry about the details. If we drink, make noise, and sleep together, we're a family!"

<blank>

The village head laughs gaily.

<blank>

I wonder if this ...... is a good idea just because I gave him some dragon material."

Only that. What are you talking about after making my grandmothers so young?

<blank>

Rejuvenate!　What's that I don't know!

<blank>

Aaah. I guess the Master wasn't sure of the age of the Dwarves."

I don't know!　What is rejuvenation?　What did I do?

"You put your hands around your eyes and say, 'Here's the magic of cosmetic surgery.

<blank>

They said they erased fine lines and wrinkles and stuff. I've done it!

<blank>

And drink more red potions."

I made this potion the other day!　I gave it to someone!

I used to drink it with alcohol, one drop in a glass. Thanks to that, my mana, which had been stagnant due to aging, improved at once."

<blank>

He said he has rejuvenated them both externally and internally.

The old women of the Five Elders, even by Dwarven standards, are loli hag - if not quite a loli hag, then at least a beautiful witch.

From a human point of view, she is a perfect loli hag, thank you very much.

<blank>

The grandmothers were overjoyed when they got a pair of socks in exchange for each of those.

<blank>

It was a reproduction for myself. ...... Ugh, well, it's a gift. It's my own material, so I can make as many as I want if I want to.

<blank>

...... hmm?

Maybe I'm using the gifts I received as a potion stash?

Is that the reason why the effect is more like spatial magic without the dragon element ......?

<blank>

No wonder you're so popular.

I'm sure you'll be popular. I mean, that's very popular. It's funny that I'm not popular.

<blank>

I'm the type of person who spreads out the money in my wallet at cabaret clubs and ruins it.

<blank>

It's the alcohol. Everything is the fault of alcohol!

I've had enough of drinking. ......!　Thoho.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Before any more fuck-ups occur, we leave the dwarven village of Isiah's hometown.

Of course, the Five Elders and other Dwarven aunts held us back, but we left the village with our loli harem behind us.

<blank>

No, it was kind of an awesome place."

Yes. It's been a fair amount of work here, too."

<blank>

Dia, I heard that you were very popular in the children's room.

He invited me to a booze party when I grow up, or something like that. I think I'll go back to ...... now and drop that guy's thing.

<blank>

"Dear Sir, I'm sorry about my family."

Haha, it's just something a kid says, so we'll take it with a grain of salt."

...... Well, if you say so, Dear."

<blank>

In fact, it's even possible that I've distorted his sexuality, and I'll forgive him this time.

<blank>

And it was harder on Arthur than it was on me."

I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm sure it's a good idea. I got one scale back. ......

<blank>

Oh, so that's why you were kind of limping. Oh, is that because you got ridden around by kids?　I see, good job babysitting.

<blank>

I heard there is usually a babysitter who stops the pranks, but she wasn't there this time."

Uh, ......."

<blank>

That's probably because I made him a samurai. I'm sure.

<blank>

The parents looked at me with a pale face and gave me this. The parents handed it to me with a pale face, so I accepted it.

You didn't get your scales back, did you? Oh, Arthur, you can keep your allowance."

'Oh, yay!　It's worth being plucked!

<blank>

Holding a leather bag filled with money, Mr. Arthur was delighted.

Is that okay? Dragon pride and all that. ...... If I had pride, I wouldn't be a pet.

<blank>

I'm sure that's your own material, right, Miss? Hehe, please take good care of it!

What do you think of items made from dragon materials?

It's hard to explain. If it's bones or magic stones, it's like a bird making a nest out of loose hair, right?　It's not something to get worked up about.

<blank>

Hmmm, surprisingly tolerant.

<blank>

If someone had one, I'd want to kill him.

Oh, there it is."

<blank>

I'm rather proud to be equipped by Miss!　I'm sure it's all right!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, so we headed to Akhagane, the capital of Tessin, the land of the dwarves.
