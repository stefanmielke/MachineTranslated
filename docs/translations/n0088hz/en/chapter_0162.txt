# The Type to Scatter Money from My Wallet at a Cabaret and Meet Ruin

<b>

<b>

"Hey, should I call you stepmother?"

"Stop it? That just makes me your grandma, Aisia."

"Come on, don't sweat the small stuff. If we drink and party together and then sleep, that makes us family!"

<b>

The village chief laughed heartily.

<b>

"Just giving you dragon materials and this happens... Is that okay?"

"Just? What are you saying after making the old ladies so young?"

<b>

You made them young!? What does that even mean? I didn't know anything about that!?

<b>

"Oh, you don't really understand dwarven ages, do you, master?"

"I don't know! What do you mean by making them young!? What did I do!?"

"Like, you put your hand on your eyes and said, 'It's beauty surgery magic!'"

<b>

Apparently, it erased fine lines. Oh no, what have I done!

<b>

"Then I made them drink a red potion."

"Wait, that potion I made the other day!? You made them drink that!?"

"Well, I did mix it with alcohol. Just a drop in a full glass. Thanks to that, their mana, which had stagnated due to aging, improved dramatically."

<b>

So, both their appearance and inner selves were rejuvenated.

The grandmas of the five great elders became, if not loli grandmas by dwarven standards, at least beautiful women.

From a human perspective, they were perfectly loli grandmas. Thank you very much.

<b>

"The grandmas who exchanged socks for those got super happy, you know?"

<b>

They were duplicates for myself... Ugh, well, it's a gift, so it's fine. I can make as many as I want since I'm the material.

<b>

...Huh?

Could it be that the gifts I received weren't used as a secret ingredient in my potions?

Is that why they have a somewhat spatial magic-like effect without much dragon element...?

<b>

"It's only natural that the hero is popular."

"Yeah, right. I mean, of course, he's popular. It's strange if he's not."

<b>

I'm the type to scatter money from my wallet at a cabaret and meet ruin.

<b>

It's the alcohol. Everything is the alcohol's fault!!

I'm so done with alcohol...!! Oh dear.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Before any more blunders could happen, we left Aisia's hometown, the dwarven village.

Of course, the grandmas, including the five great elders, tried to stop us with great enthusiasm, but we left the village, even as I was torn between the loli harem.

<b>

"Wow, that was quite a place."

"Yes. It was quite challenging for us too."

<b>

It seems that Dia was also quite popular in the children's room.

He was invited to a drinking party when he grows up. ...Should I go back now and drop that thing of his?

<b>

"I'm sorry about my family, master."

"Ahaha, let's overlook it since it's what children say."

"...Well, if Dia says so."

<b>

There's even a possibility that I might have distorted his preferences, so maybe I'll let it slide this time.

<b>

"Besides, Arthur had it tougher than I did."

"Yeah... The kids don't hold back. I lost a scale..."

<b>

Ah, so that's why he looked so exhausted. Wait, was it because he was ridden by the children? I see, good job babysitting.

<b>

"Apparently, there usually is a grandma who stops their mischief, but she wasn't around this time."

"Ah..."

<b>

That's probably because I was having her serve me. Yeah.

<b>

"Oh, this is the payment for the scale I lost. The parents looked pale when they handed it over, so I accepted it."

"So you didn't get the scale back. Ah, you can use it for Arthur's allowance."

"Yay! It was worth losing a scale!"

<b>

Arthur was delighted with the leather pouch filled with money.

Is that really okay? What about the pride of a dragon? ...If there was pride, I wouldn't be a pet.

<b>

"By the way, sis, that's your own material, right? Hehe, take good care of it!"

"What do dragons think about items made with dragon materials?"

"Well, it's hard to explain. Unlike bones or magic stones, it's like a bird making a nest with its own feathers? It's not something to get worked up about."

<b>

Huh, surprisingly tolerant.

<b>

"Well, if someone unworthy has it, I might want to kill them."

"Oh, so that's how it is."

<b>

It's actually a source of pride for me to have it equipped by sis, so I'm good with that!!

<b>

<b>

Well, with all that, we headed towards the capital of the dwarven nation, Tesshin, Akahagane.
