# It's not fair to post information after the fact.

I cut up wild boar meat into steak sized pieces and grilled it. Aged?　I don't want to do it badly and let it rot. I'll ask the butcher next time.

<blank>

I wonder if he grew up eating the delicacies of the mountains. Wild boars are so delicious.

This is a treat just to salt and bake it, sister Karina."

<blank>

Thanks to the perfect draining of blood, there was no smell at all, and the umami taste was strong.

It's like an evolution of pork. Oh, I'd love to eat rice.

<blank>

But as expected of Dia-kun, even though he is supposed to be eating the same food as I am, the knife and fork carve the meat and bring it to his mouth without making a sound. It is hard to believe that this is the same tableware that was in the pirate's hideout.

<blank>

It is a wild boar steak, but to be precise, it is more of a roast boar than a steak, since it was thrown into a space that was made as hot as an oven.

<blank>

When we tried to make a sauna after the bath, Dia asked us, "How hot can you make it?" I tried it out and found that the upper limit seemed to be well over 200 degrees Celsius - as expected, it would take a lot of magic power to maintain it - so it turned out to be possible to turn it into an oven.

<blank>

I can make fried food with the fat. Maybe spatial magic is good for cooking. I can even cut it."

<blank>

If you want, you can also gather firewood and ignite it with the pneumatic ignition phenomenon caused by space compression.

Water can be extracted from seawater to make fresh water, or even salt. Or a vacuum can be created by space expansion, since water boils at room temperature in a vacuum.

<blank>

"I think it's an effective use, but I think it's pretty wasteful. ......

Magic is best when it's useful, Dear. Magic is more useful for daily life than powerful offensive magic that can destroy a country.

<blank>

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and cleaned it with purification magic.

<blank>

That's ...... for sure."

<blank>

Dia agrees. I wiped my mouth with a handkerchief, where did I get it from? Hmmm, this guy's daughter is a lady after all. ......

<blank>

<blank>

I'd like to build a proper kitchen. Don't you want to have a new table and sofa in the living room, not the ones we got from the pirates' hideout?

Yes, the tables and chairs, but the cloths and cushions kind of smell."

I think it's true," he said. The closet also smells strangely of smoke or something.

<blank>

And then there was a thump, and I turned around to see an SP catalog had fallen out.

How arbitrary, the furniture page is open. Double bed 100SP......

<blank>

God, you're watching, aren't you?"

<blank>

Since Mr. Cossioli has now moved to my room, the living room and bathroom are God's peeking space. At least, I would like him not to peep into the bathroom or toilet.

<blank>

'Dear, may I ask you to speak to me when you take a bath?

What?　Na, na, why?"

No, I thought I'd lend you a peep-proof item: ......"

No, I don't need it!　I'm a man and I'm not ashamed to be peeked at!"

<blank>

Hmmm, okay then. Let God look at you to his heart's content.

<blank>

<blank>

The catalog reminded me that I currently have 1000 SP accumulated.

Furniture can be bought in town without asking the gods, so what should be exchanged are rare items that cannot be found in town. Scrolls for skill acquisition, for example.

<blank>

I wish I could have used it for you, Dear, but there was an additional note saying that the skill acquisition scroll was for my exclusive use only. Don't add that after the fact, God, it's not fair to give out information after the fact. No, it's better than being told after the exchange.

<blank>

So, how should these things be exchanged ...... I decided to throw it all to Mr. Dear, whom I have been totally relying on for a while now.

<blank>

What do you think? What do you think I should exchange?"

"SP catalog ......?　Eh, sister, what are you going to do to become even stronger than you are now?"

<blank>

Yes, you are right. I am already strong enough. At close range, I am invincible and can kick around without any body art, and at long range, spatial magic is versatile.

<blank>

'Though, there are some skills that are hard to get normally. Especially the resistance ones."

'What, is it normal to get a scroll to learn a skill?'

I heard that you can get them in dungeons and other places. People who get them often use them as they are, but some are sold at auctions."

<blank>

Dungeon!　Auction!　That's what it's all about!

<blank>

I said, "Okay, let's go to the dungeon sometime!　Where is it?"

'Sorry, I'm not familiar with the geography of this area ...... so. Would you like me to write to them and ask?"

Surely, if you ask him, he'll tell you at once."

<blank>

After all, Grandma Maria is the former wife of a former lord. She must have some information about that kind of thing.

But, you know, there is an air of being made to work for good if you make too much debt, old Maria.

<blank>

"...... No!　Let's gather our own information here!　It's more adventurous!"

So you are going to work as Karina Shonin first. Understood."

<blank>

Let's aim to actually go to the dungeon to get the scroll.

Well, I don't want to be covered, so I'll leave the SP exchange until then.
