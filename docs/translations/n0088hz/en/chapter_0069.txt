# It's cowardly to hold back information.

I tried cutting wild boar meat into steak-sized pieces and grilling it. Aging? I don't want to mess it up and let it rot, so I'll skip that for now. Maybe I'll ask the butcher next time.

<b>

"I wonder if it grew up eating the blessings of the mountains. Wild boar is really delicious."

"This is a feast just by sprinkling salt and grilling it, isn't it, Sister Karina?"

<b>

Thanks to the perfect bloodletting, there's no smell at all, and the umami is strong.

It feels like an evolved version of pork. Ah, I want to eat rice.

<b>

But as expected of Dia-kun, even though he must be eating the same thing as me, he cuts the meat with a knife and fork without making a sound and brings it to his mouth. The performance of the same tableware we had at the pirate hideout is unbelievable.

<b>

It's wild boar steak, but to be precise, I threw it into a space heated like an oven, so it's more like roasted wild boar.

<b>

When I tried to create a sauna after the bath, Dia-kun asked me, "How hot can you make it?" and when I tried, it seemed like the upper limit easily exceeded 200 degrees—though it looked like maintaining it would consume a lot of magical power—so it was discovered that I could do what an oven does.

<b>

"I can also make fried food with the fat. Space magic might be suited for cooking. I can also cut things."

<b>

If anything, there's also the option of gathering firewood and igniting it using the pressure ignition phenomenon from space compression.

I can extract fresh water from seawater, and conversely, I can also make salt. Vacuuming through space expansion would work too, as water boils at room temperature in a vacuum.

<b>

"I think it’s a useful application, but it does seem like quite a waste..."

"Magic is best when it can be used conveniently, Dia-kun. Magic that helps in daily life has more opportunities for use than powerful attack magic that can destroy a nation."

<b>

I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and used purification magic to clean it.

<b>

"That’s... certainly true."

<b>

Dia-kun agrees. He wiped his mouth with a handkerchief he pulled out from who knows where. Hmm, this boy is definitely a lady...

<b>

<b>

"I want to make a proper kitchen too. Don’t you want to prepare new tables and sofas instead of the ones we got from the pirate hideout?"

"That's true, the table and chairs aside, the fabric and cushions smell a bit."

"Yeah, right? The closet has a strange smoky smell too."

<b>

Just then, there was a sound of something dropping, and when I turned around, the SP catalog had fallen.

How convenient that the furniture page was open. Double bed 100 SP...

<b>

"God, are you watching?"

<b>

Coshori-kun has currently moved to my room, so the living room and bath have become spaces where the god can peek. I would prefer if they didn’t peek at the bath or toilet at least.

<b>

"Dia-kun, can you let me know when you're going to take a bath?"

"Eh!? W-why?"

"Well, I was thinking of lending you an item to prevent peeping..."

"I-I don't need it! I'm a boy, so I wouldn't be embarrassed even if someone peeked!"

<b>

Hmm, then that's fine. Go ahead and be seen by the god to your heart's content.

<b>

<b>

I remembered while looking at the catalog that I currently have 1000 SP saved up.

I can buy furniture in town without asking the god, so what I should exchange for are rare items that can't be obtained in town. Skill acquisition scrolls, etc.

<b>

It would have been nice if Dia-kun could use them too, but the note saying that skill acquisition scrolls are for my exclusive use had increased. God, don’t add information later, it’s cowardly. Well, it’s better than being told after the exchange.

<b>

So, how should I go about exchanging these... I decided to leave it entirely to Dia-kun, who I've been relying on lately.

<b>

"Hey, Dia-kun. Actually, I have something like this, and I can power up, but what do you think I should exchange for?"

"SP catalog...? Wait, Sister, what are you going to do getting stronger than you already are?"

<b>

Yeah, that's a valid point. I'm already strong enough. I can scatter enemies in close combat even without martial arts, and in long-range, space magic is versatile.

<b>

"That said, there are indeed skills that are difficult to obtain normally. Especially resistance skills would be good, don't you think?"

"Eh, are skill acquisition scrolls something you can normally get?"

"I've heard you can obtain them in dungeons. Usually, the person who gets them uses them right away, but some are put up for auction."

<b>

Dungeons! Auctions! So those exist too!!

<b>

"Alright, let's go to a dungeon next time! I wonder where they are?"

"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with the geography around here... Oh, how about we ask in a letter?"

"That would definitely give us a clear answer."

<b>

After all, Maria-baa is the former lord's wife. She probably has that kind of information.

But, well, if I borrow too much, it feels like I might end up being used for her convenience.

<b>

"...No! Let's gather information ourselves! That feels more like an adventurer!"

"So, we will act as Karina Shownin first. Understood."

<b>

Let's aim to actually go to a dungeon and obtain a scroll.

Well, I don't want to overlap, so I'll hold off on the SP exchange until then.
