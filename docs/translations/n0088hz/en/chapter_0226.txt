# Dear-kun VS Big Sis (Full-body Bear Beastkin) (First Half)

<b>

So, I won the first round with ease.

<b>

I mean, come on, how could I lose? Magic wasn’t banned, after all.

I didn’t even need to read my opponent’s mind—by linking our hands with spatial magic, I could guarantee victory.

<b>

If her ring finger opened, I’d play scissors. Otherwise, rock. That alone would lead to a win or a tie.

If I wanted to play paper, I’d use pattern two: when her index finger opened, I’d play scissors; otherwise, paper. Another win or tie.

<b>

With this automatic hand-following-janken strategy, my opponent wouldn’t notice a thing. Haha, easy win.

Then it was just a matter of bopping them.

<b>

My first opponent was a laid-back pro, and since only she had to reveal some skin while I didn’t, the audience’s attention focused on her—a win-win.

<b>

Oh, and before the match, I lent her a pair of socks.

I’ll call it “sending socks to the enemy,” like “sending salt to the enemy.”

She put them on briefly, but then took them off immediately, so I don’t expect much SP from that.

<b>

Maybe 10 SP at most? I’m getting a feel for this kind of thing.

<b>

“Karina-chan’s sock sense is evolving...!”

<b>

God? Wait, was this a match in the presence of the gods? What kind of crazy idea is it to make a strip janken a holy match? She’s a goddess! And a loli!

<b>

“I couldn’t be more thrilled! Could we make it so removed socks are dedicated to the gods? But let’s keep my tastes a secret, please. Otherwise, there’ll be a weird bias.”

<b>

Too much to ask, no thanks.

<b>

Meanwhile, Misha also won her match handily.

If you watched closely, you’d see her winning janken with a bit of delay, and even if she lost, she’d quickly put on her helmet to avoid disrobing.

<b>

Her opponent, a bunny-eared participant, couldn’t get Misha to take off even a single item. Once she was down to just her undergarments, she surrendered, and Misha accepted, ending the match.

<b>

<b>

Now we’ve got Dear-kun vs. Big Sis (Full-body Bear Beastkin).

<b>

“Rock-paper-scissors, whack!”

<b>

Dear-kun loses the janken, so he puts on a helmet. Then, Big Sis Bear gives a gentle pop on the helmet.

It doesn’t seem like much of a strip match, but apparently, some people enjoy this.

<b>

“…Eep!”

“Oh, I-I’m sorry! Did I hit too hard?”

“Oh, no. I’m fine.”

<b>

Big Sis Bear, jangling her bracelets, apologizes.

<b>

“Elven girls even have cute screams… this could awaken something in me.”

“…Moving on to the next round?”

<b>

In the next janken, Dear-kun wins and immediately delivers a swift thwack.

<b>

“Oh my, Big Sis got whacked!”

“Phew… this is my true strength!”

<b>

Now that I think about it, he’s wearing a gothic lolita dress from the Five Elders Workshop, so his speed should be boosted, too.

<b>

“Well then, let’s start with this bracelet.”

<b>

Big Sis Bear removes one of her bracelets with a clink… and the moment it touches the floor, it sinks in with a heavy thud.

Wait, what? That weight is ridiculous for something so delicate-looking.

<b>

“Oh, this is a diet ring magic tool. Each one weighs 10 kg.”

“…T-this is a tough opponent…”

“If I take them all off, I might start getting serious.”

<b>

That’s way beyond a diet. Her arm could snap off.

And she has five on each arm? So, 100 kg total?

<b>

She’s a real powerhouse—what’s Dear-kun going to do…?
