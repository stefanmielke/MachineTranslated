# Deer-kun vs. sister (full-body type bear beastman) (first half)

<blank>

So I won the first round in an assortment.

<blank>

What? Because I don't have anything to lose.　After all, magic is not prohibited.

I don't read their minds, but I can win a must by using spatial magic to link their hands with mine.

<blank>

If the opponent's ring finger opens, I play choki. Otherwise, I play goo. This is the only way to win or aiko.

Since this alone does not produce a par, we also prepared pattern 2, in which the opponent's index finger is open for choki, and the other fingers are open for par. This is also a winner or a loser.

<blank>

It's a rock-paper-scissors winning magic that the opponent will never notice because my hand just moves automatically in conjunction with his/her fingers. Gahaha, you win.

All that's left to do is to smack the popcorn.

<blank>

The sister in my first match was a professional who was not a stiff, and it was more of a win-win, as it was good publicity for her to be able to attract attention by exposing only her own skin without me exposing mine.

<blank>

Oh, I lent the other sister a sock before the game.

Don't send salt to the enemy, send socks to the enemy: ......!

Although they were able to put them on, they were the first to take them off, so I don't expect them to be SP.

<blank>

At best, I'd say 10 sp.　I'm starting to understand something about that kind of thing lately.

<blank>

'Carina, you've developed a good sense of socks, too. ......!

<blank>

God?　Is this place also a game before God? What are they thinking, making undressing rock-paper-scissors into a match before God? It's a goddess, right?　And she's a loli.

<blank>

I don't mind at all!　Would you rather have a system of offering undressed socks to God?　In that case, please keep my sexuality hidden. It would be a little too much for my taste.

<blank>

It's too reckless. It's impossible.

<blank>

And by the way, Misha was also a regular winner.

Something like this, if you look closely, you can see that he won a lot of rock-paper-scissors afterwards, and even when he accidentally lost, he quickly put on his helmet and evaded the situation.

<blank>

The opponent, Mr. Rabbit Ears, looked like a regular participant, but he seemed unable to take off a single piece of clothing against Misha, who was really serious. When he got down to his underwear, he gave up and surrendered, and Misha accepted his surrender and the game was won.

<blank>

<blank>

In. It's Deer-kun vs. his sister (full-body type bear beastman).

<blank>

"Knock, Cover, Rock, Paper, Scissors!"

<blank>

Dia loses at rock-paper-scissors and puts on a helmet. The bear sister hits him there with a pop.

I don't think it's worth undressing, but I hear there is a demand for this kind of thing.

<blank>

"...... hiya!"

"Oh, I'm sorry.　Did I come on too strong?"

Oh, no. I'm fine."

<blank>

The bear sister, who is shuffling her bracelets, apologizes unintentionally.

<blank>

I think I'm going to wake up ...... to the fact that elf girls are so cute when they scream."

"...... will you go next?"

<blank>

And in the next round of rock-paper-scissors, Deere wins. And at the same time, there was a slamming sound!　and there was a slapping sound.

<blank>

Oh my gosh, she beat me up."

Phew ...... this is how serious I am!"

<blank>

Come to think of it, it's a gothic loli dress from the Five Elder Workshop, so it should be a lot faster.

<blank>

Oh, well, I guess I'll start with this bracelet."

<blank>

The bear lady takes off one of her bracelets. The bracelet was so thin that it made a sound when it hit the floor!　The bracelets made a sound as they plunged to the floor.

What? What is that? It's not as heavy as it looks.

<blank>

Oh, these are magic tools for diet rings. Each one weighs 10 kg.

"...... this is a formidable opponent ......"

When I get all this off my chest, maybe I'll get a little more serious."

<blank>

It's not a diet. If I'm not careful, I'll cut my arms off.

And what about the 5 on each arm?　Does that mean 100 kg for both arms?

<blank>

This is a really strong opponent, what do you think, Deere. ......
