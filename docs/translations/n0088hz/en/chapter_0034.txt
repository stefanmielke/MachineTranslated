# Tasting Comparison

<b>

<b>

I, Karina-chan, was challenged by a pirate, huh?

Is this something I can buy? What do you think, staff-san!

<b>

"Staff-san! I was told to ask the guild about products I'm not sure whether I can buy or sell, so I'm asking—can I buy this fight?"

"Please stop..."

"Then, I'd like you to buy up all the alcohol that caused this situation at the merchant guild's tavern. Is that alright? Oh, the market price is fine."

"…Understood, I'll buy it."

<b>

Alright, profit secured! I've sold off all the alcohol I bought from Sati-tan!

If it's with the merchant guild, I shouldn't have to worry about being overcharged.

<b>

"So, please buy the alcohol from the guild again, okay? Um, what was your name again… Gomen Desu-san?"

"Ahhh!? What did you say, you punk!"

<b>

Whoa, the pirate is getting furious. Well, at least he's not attacking yet; he seems calmer than a thug.

<b>

"Shut up, you lowlife."

<b>

I glare at him sharply. Additionally, I use spatial magic to temporarily fix his body in place.

I keep his feet from moving so he can't attack.

<b>

"…! My feet, they won't move…!? Am I being intimidated by this?!"

<b>

Yes, that's the reaction I wanted to see!

Now that I've seen the reaction I wanted, I'll release the fix.

<b>

<b>

"Now then, Gomen Desu-san? How about we have a little competition here? How about a tasting comparison? I hear some good alcohol just came in?"

"A competition!? Sure, I'll take that fight! A pirate can't be underestimated!"

"The loser pays for the drinks! If I lose, I'll pay with my body!! I swear to God!"

"Bring it on, you punk!"

<b>

And I swear to God, I intentionally challenge him to a tasting comparison.

<b>

Behold, God. It's alright, I have a winning strategy. In fact, I only have winning strategies.

After being taken down by Sati-tan with alcohol, I had been thinking of this method as a countermeasure against alcohol.

With this, no matter how much alcohol I consume, I won't get drunk――

<b>

――That's right, with spatial magic!

<b>

"Ah, I'm starting to feel a bit hot. Master, refill please!"

"…A, a monster…!?"

<b>

Wow, I've downed a whole barrel of wine.

<b>

Oh, I was competing with Gomez using the alcohol I procured. As merchants, we decided to compete using each other's stock.

Wow, the sneaky tactic of trying to gain an advantage through the difference in alcohol content is so obvious! But since I initiated the competition, I had no objections, so I accepted.

<b>

Of course, as you can see, I'm not drunk at all!

I'm just a bit flushed from the smell of the alcohol!!

<b>

<b>

What? You're curious about how I, who should be weak to alcohol, can drink like a sieve?

<b>

The method is simple.

I use spatial magic to switch the alcohol with water just before it enters my mouth, and then return that water to a storage space the moment it enters my stomach.

By doing this, I've successfully stocked up on alcohol in my storage space at Gomez's expense!

<b>

I'll enjoy this stock later when I'm alone!

I might even pack it into empty bottles and sell it. Since I changed it to water before drinking, it's not like I had a sip.

I'll enjoy both red and white wine. Yay!

<b>

<b>

"Oh? Oh? What's wrong, are you giving up already?"

"…oborororororeba"

"Ugh, that's disgusting. Don't puke out the precious alcohol."

<b>

And then Gomez spat out alcohol from his mouth and nose and collapsed. Is he okay with acute alcohol poisoning? I don't know.

Good kids shouldn't imitate such reckless drinking!!

<b>

"Yay, I win! Master, please charge this guy as promised!"

"…Okay."

"Hey you guys, if you learned your lesson from this, don't mess with me again. Anyone with complaints can challenge me to a tasting comparison!! Hahaha!!"

"Ugh, ughhh."

"I-I'll remember this!"

<b>

As I said that, the pirates carried Gomez and left the tavern. The lounge space was empty. It's a waste to leave behind snacks like cheese. Can I take the ones that haven't been touched?

Oh, I wonder if ordering snacks now would count as his tab.

<b>

"By the way, doesn't that count as dining and dashing?"

"It's deducted from the merchant guild's account."

<b>

How convenient, merchant guild. Hehe, thanks for the treat!
