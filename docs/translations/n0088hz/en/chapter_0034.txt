# Drinking Comparison

<blank>

<blank>

I, Karina, have been in a fight with a pirate?

I wonder if this is a good product to buy?　What do you think, staff?

<blank>

I'm sorry, but I've been told that I should ask the guild if I'm not sure about buying or selling. I was told to ask the guild about products I don't know if I can buy or sell, so I'm just asking, can I buy fights?"

"Please don't do this: ......"

I would like to buy all the liquor that caused this situation from the merchant guild's liquor store. Is that okay?　Oh, the market price will be fine."

"...... Okay, I'll buy it."

<blank>

Okay, profit!　I sold out all the liquor I bought from Saty Tan!

If you are dealing with a merchant guild, you don't have to worry about being ripped off.

<blank>

So, please buy your alcohol from the guild again. Um, what's your name, Mr. ...... Gomendez?"

Aaaaaaah!　What the hell, you!"

<blank>

Oh, the pirate has lost his temper. No, I guess he's cooler than the pirate, since he hasn't hit me yet.

<blank>

"Shut up, you son of a bitch."

<blank>

I'm going to glare at him. In addition, I fix my body for a moment with spatial magic.

Just keep stopping your feet to avoid getting hit.

<blank>

I'm going to go to ......!　Oh, my legs, I can't move. ......!　Am I being intimidated?

<blank>

Yes, I wanted to see that reaction!

Now that we've seen the reaction we want to see, let's unfix it.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, Mr. Gomendez?　How about a game of one here?　How about a drinking contest? I hear they just got some good sake in stock.

"A fight?　Fine, I'll buy you that fight!　A pirate is done for if he's taken advantage of!"

The loser buys!　If I lose, I'll pay you with my body!　I swear to God, okay?"

I'll take my chances, bitch!

<blank>

And I swear to God, I dare to compete in a drinking contest.

<blank>

See for yourself, God. Don't worry, the odds are in our favor. I mean, there is only a chance.

It was a method I had been considering as a countermeasure against alcohol since Satitan crushed me with alcohol.

With this I will never get drunk, no matter how much alcohol I sip--I will never get drunk.

<blank>

-- yes, if it's spatial magic!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

I'm getting a little hot. Master, another drink!

"......, you monster ......? ......!"

<blank>

Well, I must have emptied a barrel of wine.

<blank>

Oh, I was competing with wine and Gomez was competing with the liquor I stocked. As merchants, we told each other we'd compete with each other on the liquor we both stocked.

Well, I can see your iniquitous attempt to gain an advantage by the difference in the alcohol content!　But I initiated the game, and I had no objection, so I accepted.

<blank>

Motrón, as you can see, I'm not drunk at all!

I think the reason I'm on fire is because I'm a little drunk from the smell of alcohol!

<blank>

<blank>

What?　You're wondering how I can drink like a monkey when I'm not supposed to be good at drinking?

<blank>

It's easy to do.

Spatial magic replaces the liquor with water just before it enters the mouth, and that water is also returned to the storage space the moment it enters the stomach.

This allowed me to stockpile alcohol in the storage space, courtesy of Gomez!

<blank>

I'll enjoy this stockpile later when I'm alone!

Maybe I could pack it in an empty bottle and sell it. I changed it to water before I put my mouth on it, so I'm not even close to drinking it.

Both red wine and white wine are delicious. Yay!

<blank>

<blank>

Oh?　Oh?　What's the matter, are you giving up already?"

...... dumb-rool-roge-baa."

"You're so dirty! Don't spit out my drink.

<blank>

And Gomez collapsed, spewing alcohol from his mouth and nose. Are you okay with acute alcohol poisoning or something?　I don't know.

Good children should not imitate this reckless way of drinking!

<blank>

I win!　Master, please give him the bill as promised!

"...... hi"

If you get tired of this, don't get involved with me. If you have a problem with me, I'll make you compete with me in a drinking contest!　Ha ha ha!

"G-G-G-Nuh-uh."

Oh, oh, remember me!"

<blank>

As I said this, the pirates left the bar carrying Gomez. A garrulous lounge space. It's a waste of snacks like cheese. Can I have the ones I haven't touched?

Oh, I'd rather ask for some snacks now and then to pay for that guy.

<blank>

I mean, isn't that a form of binge eating?"

The money is deducted from the account of the Merchant's Guild.

<blank>

How convenient, the merchant guild. Ehehe, I'll be your guest.
