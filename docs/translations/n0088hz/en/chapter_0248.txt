# Oh dear?

<b>

"Lady Miko, and your companions. Breakfast is ready."

<b>

In the tatami room, grilled fish, rice, and miso soup are laid out on the table. There's also a spinach side dish, making it a typical one soup, two sides, Japanese breakfast.

<b>

"...Wait, this is Japanese food! It's actually here, Japanese food!!"

"What is 'Washoku,' big sister?"

"Ah... it's the traditional food from my hometown? It's usually something like this."

<b>

Well, it's a world where reincarnators or transferors probably exist, so it's not surprising to have Japanese food. ...Hmm, in that case, it's a shame I can't eat it all after having a proper breakfast...

Oh, I could just store it in a time-stopped space. I'll eat it later. Just like that.

<b>

By the way, chopsticks and a wooden spoon are provided. It's a nice consideration for those who can't use chopsticks. Such hospitality!

<b>

"...Meow, it smells strange."

"It's miso soup. Are you not good with miso? Mixing it with rice makes it a cat's meal."

"I can mix it! Let's see... Oh! This is actually pretty good!"

<b>

Misha poured miso soup over her rice without hesitation and ate it with the wooden spoon. She also picked up the tail of the grilled fish and started munching on it from the head. You're going to get bones stuck, you know?

<b>

"I'll eat them separately. This is the staple food, and this is the side dish, right? And the soup."

<b>

Dear-kun smoothly used chopsticks to eat.

<b>

"I'll have some too. Grilled fish, grilled fish."

<b>

He gulped down the grilled fish whole. Are you going to eat the rice and miso soup? Oh, you are. Just like that.

<b>

"Ah, I'm full."

"Thank you for the meal."

"Ah, it was okay! ...Yawn..."

<b>

Arthur yawned.

<b>

"I'm starting to feel sleepy..."

"Hey, did you stay up late last night?"

<b>

Arthur rubbed his eyes. He looked like a cat washing its face.

<b>

"Ah, eating two meals makes me sleepy... Zzz..."

"I'm feeling sleepy too with a full stomach... Mmm..."

<b>

Oh dear? Misha and Dear-kun have also laid down.

...

<b>

"Hey?"

<b>

I poked Dear-kun's cheek. I lightly slapped Misha's bottom. I plucked a scale from Arthur. Hmm, they're not waking up. They're really deep in sleep.

It's quite unnatural.

<b>

Ah! Could this be that thing!? They must have slipped sleeping pills into the food, and they're planning to use us as sacrifices!

<b>

"...Alright!"

<b>

I have to ride this big wave.

I also quietly laid down. If I pretend to sleep, it would be nice if they carry me to the dragon.

Oh, of course, I'll take revenge later. I need to send the dragon after them to make them give me their socks. And I need them to make Japanese food without sleeping pills too.

<b>

Don't touch the weird parts, okay? If it's a girl, you can touch, though.
