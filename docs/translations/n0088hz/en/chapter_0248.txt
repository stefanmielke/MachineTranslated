# Oh, well?

Miko, your attendants. Breakfast is served."

<blank>

and in a Japanese-style tatami room, grilled fish, rice, and miso soup were served on the table. There was also a spinach salad, a very ordinary one-soup, two-course, Japanese breakfast.

<blank>

I'm thinking, "...... is Japanese food, this!　Is it normal, Japanese food!

'Sis, what is washok?"

"Uh, ...... traditional food in our hometown?　It's usually something like this on the menu."

<blank>

Well, it's a world where reincarnated people or people who have moved to another world are common, so it's not surprising that there is Japanese food. ......Mmmm, it would be a shame not to be able to eat a good breakfast. ......

Oh, I should just save it for a normal time-stopped storage space. I'll eat it later. Just a pop.

<blank>

Incidentally, chopsticks and a wooden spoon are provided. It's a nice gesture for those who can't use chopsticks. That's hospitality!

<blank>

"......, ya'll smell funny."

Miso soup. Not a fan of miso?　You mix it with rice and it becomes a rice dish called nekomanma."

Can we mix it up?"　Let's see... ...... Oh, that's pretty good!　This is pretty good!

<blank>

Without hesitation, Misha poured miso soup over rice and ate it with a wooden spoon. She also picked up grilled fish by the tail and ate it head first. The bones stick, don't they?

<blank>

Do you eat separately? Usually, this is the main dish and this is the side dish, and soup.

<blank>

Dia easily eats with chopsticks.

<blank>

I'll have some myself. Grilled fish, grilled fish.

<blank>

Gulp and eat the grilled fish as if you were going to eat the whole thing. Do you eat rice and miso soup?　Oh, you eat them. Just like that.

<blank>

"Whew, I snagged it!"

Thank you for the food."

'Oh, it was so-so! ......fuh ......'

<blank>

And Arthur yawns.

<blank>

'I'm getting sleepy ......'

'Hey, hey, did you stay up late last night?'

<blank>

Arthur rubs his eyes with a comb. He looks like a cat washing his face.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to eat two meals a day, but I'm sure it will make you sleepy. ......Suyaa......"

"I'm also getting sleepy ...... with a bloated tummy."

<blank>

Oh well?　Misha and Mr. Dear have gone to lie down too.

......

<blank>

"Hey?"

<blank>

A peck, a peck on Dear's cheek. A light slap on Misha's buttocks. I pluck one of Arthur's scales. I don't think he's going to wake up. He's too sleepy.

It is indeed unnatural.

<blank>

Ah!　Is that what this is?　They put sleeping pills in the rice, and they're going to sacrifice us with them!

<blank>

"...... Okay!"

<blank>

We have to ride this big wave.

I gently lay down too. It would be nice and easy if I could pretend to be asleep and they would carry me to the dragon.

Of course, I'll retaliate later. I'm going to have to make him give up his socks to the dragons. And I also need you to make me a Japanese meal without sleeping pills.

<blank>

Don't touch anything weird, okay?　If it's a girl, you can touch her, though.
