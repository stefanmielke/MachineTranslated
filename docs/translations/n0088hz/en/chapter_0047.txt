# ……I changed clothes ●Illustration included

<b>

"Um, Karina onee-san. Where should I change?"

"Hmm? You can change around there... Ah, but don't go near that bed! There are (in a way) dangerous things lying around!"

"Y-yes."

<b>

I won't let anyone near my private space. ...I need to hide various things. There are things that shouldn't be shown to children.

Also, even though it's called a bed, there are only a box and a blanket for now.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Karina onee-san... I changed."

"Oh, that was quick... Hmm!"

In a black dress with over-the-knee socks. Such remarkable cuteness that one wouldn't believe it's a boy...!

While seeking cuteness, it seems they chose a simple dress out of embarrassment. But it suits them well. The freshness of their first cross-dressing!

Their cheeks are flushed, and they have a troubled expression. Even though they're a boy, it’s still embarrassing to dress like a girl! I understand, since I was a man too!

In other words, that’s a sense of shame — the spice that the gods seek!

<b>

"...I properly changed into women's underwear just like Karina onee-san said. Should I confirm it?"

"W-well, let's do that later! ...Hoo, so this is what it means when you think there's no way such a cute child could be a girl."

<b>

Oh, so cute! I want to hug them! I desperately hold back the urge to swoon.

Once everything is over, I'll pet them to my heart's content!

<b>

"Did I meet your standards, onee-san...?"

"Of course, you passed! You're so cute, Dia-kun is really adorable! So cute!! The silver hair and the black dress create a wonderful contrast that suits you perfectly! So cute!!"

"Ugh, if I endure this, you'll really help my sister, right...?"

"I'll help, I'll help!"

"I understand... So, what should I do?"

"Well then, first tell me the characteristics of your sister."

"Huh? Ah, okay."

<b>

If I don't even know the face of the person I'm helping, I won't know who to assist.

Also, by casually calling them "kun" after they cross-dress, I keep reminding them that they are still a boy.

<b>

"Um, does she look similar to Dia-kun?"

"Yes. My sister is also an elf with silver hair, and her body shape is similar to Karina onee-san's, I think?"

"Hmm, hmm. The clothing isn't helpful, so that's fine, but there's not much information... Well, if I find an elf that seems like her, I'll help you. Since Dia-kun is cute, I'll do my best."

"Please, my sister is an important family member!"

<b>

It was a major operation to borrow a ship and crew from Dia-kun's family's trading company, but unfortunately, it seems they encountered pirates and had their cargo and other things stolen.

Originally, they were aiming for a port in another country and weren't supposed to come to Verald.

<b>

...I hope my sister isn't dead.

Since I said I'd help, I have to do it. After all, I'm Karina-chan, who puts words into action.

<b>

<b>

"If there's anything I can do, I'll do it...!"

"Hmm? What do you mean by anything—"

<b>

Just as I was about to respond with a standard phrase, Dia-kun's stomach growled.

<b>

"I'm sorry..."

"Ahaha. Just scallops alone won't be enough, right? There's more food, so eat up. As for drinks... there's only water and alcohol! I'll lend you a cup, so do you want to get the water yourself?"

<b>

I arranged preserved food and street food on a wooden box at just the right height. I should have stocked up on juice too.

...Oops, I got a bit carried away and overdid it with the duplication.

<b>

Deep breath, deep breath. Hoo.

I wonder if there are things like mana potions.

I want to secure some. Can they be made with alchemy? I wonder if they're in the alchemy textbook.

<b>

"Now, where exactly did this come from...?"

"Heh, if you want to help my sister, there's no need to pry, right?"

"I-I'll take it."

<b>

Saying that, Dia-kun starts eating the street food.

The way they eat is quite elegant, and considering the nice clothes they're wearing, they must have been on a ship... are they a little rich kid?

<b>

Making such a rich kid cross-dress might get me scolded later... but well, we'll deal with that when the time comes. If it comes to it, I can just run away!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Oh, it seems Gomez and the others have boarded the ship."

"Huh, can you tell from here?"

"Well, with magic. Now, let's see if Dia-kun's sister is on board. It would be nice if she is inside the ship..."

<b>

She's a beautiful elf, so regardless of her chastity, I doubt her life has been taken. If it were me, I would at least toy with her for a week. No doubt about it. Probably. It should be.

<b>

Gomez and the others set sail on quite a large ship — a ship that screams pirate ship. The black sails with a skull mark look very fitting.

And they must have been in a hurry, as Gomez is still panting on the deck.

I wonder if the artifact "Poseidon" is already on this ship. That’s something to look forward to.

<b>

"Well then, I'll go check inside the pirate ship. You stay here and keep watch."

"Karina onee-san... please take care of my sister."

"Leave it to me!"

<b>

For Dia-kun's sister's sake, I'll go explore the inside of the pirate ship!
