# ...... changed my clothes ●Illustration Ali

<blank>

Hey, Karina, where do I change my clothes? Where do I change my clothes?

Hmm?"　I'm going to change my clothes, well, there. ...... Oh, stay away from that bed over there!　（There's some (sort of) dangerous stuff lying around!"

Yes.

<blank>

I will keep my private space away from you. I'll keep ...... various things hidden. There are some things I don't want my kids to see.

And even though it's called a bed, it's still just a box and a blanket.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Sister Karina ...... has changed her clothes."

"Oh, that was a quick change of clothes, right ...... nnggg!"

<blank>

<blank>

Black dress and over the knee socks. He's stunningly cute, not like a man. ......

I guess she wanted to look cute, but chose a simple dress as much as possible out of embarrassment. But it suits her. It was her first time wearing a woman's dress, and it was a very first-time experience for her!

His cheeks are flushed and he looks troubled. You are a boy, but you are still embarrassed to dress up as a girl!　I understand, I used to be a guy too!

In other words, it's shame - the spice that God wants!

<blank>

"...... and I also made my underwear women's like your sister Karina said. Do you want me to check?"

'Well, I'll get to that later!　...... whoosh, this is what I mean when I say that such a pretty girl can't possibly be a girl."

<blank>

Oh, he's so cute, I want to hold him in my arms!　I try my best to hold back my agony.

When this is over, I will pet them to my heart's content!

<blank>

"Oh, did your sister's glasses suit you, ......?"

Of course I passed!　He's cute, Dear, you're very cute!　You are so cute!　Your silver-white hair and black dress look great with the perfect contrast!　You're adorable!

"Ugh, if I just bear with you, you'll really help my sister, won't you ......?"

Help, help, help!

Okay, okay, ......, so what do I do?"

Then, for now, tell me what your sister is like, Dear."

What?　Uh, yes."

<blank>

If you don't know the faces of the people you are helping, you don't know who to help.

After casually dressing up as a woman, he calls her by "kunichimi" (literally, "you are a boy") to make her aware that he is a boy.

<blank>

'Um, does my face look like Mr. Deere's?'

I'm not sure. She is also an elf with silver hair and, uh, a body like your sister Karina's, I guess?"

Hmmm..." I don't have much information about the clothes because they are not helpful. ...... Well, if I find an elf that looks like that, I will help you out. I'll do my best.

Please, my sister is my precious family!"

<blank>

It was a big business venture, renting a ship and crew from Dia's family's trading company, but unfortunately, they ran into pirates and lost the cargo and other things they were carrying.

I understand that they were originally going to a port in another country and had no plans to come to Velarde.

<blank>

I hope they didn't kill your ...... sister.

I guess I have to help her because I said I would help her. You're a girl of your word, Carina.

<blank>

<blank>

I'll do whatever I can to help. ......!"

What?　What did you just say--"

<blank>

When I tried to reply with a standard sentence, "Gooooooooo. And then Dia-kun's stomach rumbled.

<blank>

Sorry. ......."

Haha. Scallops aren't enough for you, are they?　There's other food, so eat up! The only drinks are ...... water and alcohol!　I'll lend you a glass, do you want to serve yourself some water?"

<blank>

I'll duplicate and arrange the preserved food and street food on top of a wooden box at just the right height. I should have stocked up on juice, too.

...... Oops, I got carried away and duplicated too much.

<blank>

Deep breath, deep breath. Phew.

I wonder if there is some sort of mana potion or something like that.

I would like to secure it. Can it be made by alchemy?　I wonder if it is in the alchemy book.

<blank>

"Now where the heck are you ......"

'Hmph, if you want me to help your sister, don't pry, okay?'

Yes, thank you.

<blank>

With that said, Dia-kun begins to eat the food from the street stalls.

The way he eats looks pretty classy, I mean, the clothes he wears are moderately good, and considering he was on a boat, I wonder if he's a ...... monk.

<blank>

I'm sure I'll be pissed off later for letting such a little boy dress up as a woman. ...... But, you know, when the time comes, you'll have to deal with it. If the need arises, you can just run away!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oops, looks like Gomez and the others have boarded the boat.

What, you can figure it out from here?"

Well, by magic. Well, Deere, is your sister there?　It would be easier if she were in the boat. ......"

<blank>

She's a beautiful elf, and I don't think they would have taken her life, let alone her chastity. I'd toy with her for at least a week. I'm sure of it. Probably. I'm sure of it.

<blank>

Gomez and his crew set sail on a rather large ship - a pirate ship, if you will. The black sails with skull marks looked very much like a pirate ship.

And Gomez, who must have been in a hurry, is still breathing on his shoulder on the deck.

I wonder if the sacred vessel "Poseidon" or something like that is already on this ship. I'm looking forward to that too.

<blank>

I'm going to go explore the pirate ship. You stay here."

"Carina sister ...... sister, please."

I'll take care of it.

<blank>

Dia-kun, for your sister's socks, let's explore the inside of the pirate ship!
