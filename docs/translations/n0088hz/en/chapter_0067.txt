# I don't feel bad about it.

<b>

A room has been created within the storage space.

Well, I've been with Dia-kun for a while now, so I've accumulated a lot of things. There are definitely things you can’t do unless you’re alone! Phew. I'm glad the soundproofing is perfect.

<b>

“Yawn... Good morning!”

“Oh, g-good morning, Karina-onee-san... um, please wear your clothes properly!”

<b>

Dia-kun's face is red. Oh, he was in his underwear. How embarrassing... or is it a reward to see the underwear of my first love? I see. I don't feel bad about it. I'll go change.

<b>

“Well, for now, we're on our way to Sorashidore—at least that's the plan, and we have a couple of days to spare. Since we have the chance, I thought I’d enhance this base a bit.”

“? What do you mean?”

“Oh, right. Actually...”

<b>

I explain how Karina Shounin-chan was suspected when she moved from Sorashidore to Verarudo in an instant.

<b>

“...You can move between towns in an instant, huh?”

“Yeah. So, to be honest, if I were to deliver Kumin-san, it would only take a moment for me. But I won't do it.”

“That's right, it's better not to. Once you do something like that, it becomes a question of how far is acceptable, and it leads to endless possibilities.”

<b>

Well, if they pay for transportation, I wouldn't mind, but I wouldn't know how much to charge.

<b>

“So, I think I’ll spend the next couple of days enhancing the base! Oh, and what about Dia-kun's ID? I completely forgot about that.”

“I do have an ID, but if it’s to match with you as a merchant, I should probably get an ID from the Adventurer's Guild or the Merchant's Guild... or I could become a slave.”

<b>

A slave. ...Dia-kun!?

Making such a cute girl a slave feels incredibly immoral.

<b>

“W-well, let's skip the slave part. The Adventurer's Guild should be fine; it's cheap.”

“In that case, let's register at Sorashidore.”

<b>

It seems fine to form a party as adventurers and have him assist.

<b>

“Also, for now, there are no doors to the outside, so Dia-kun can't enter or exit the storage space when I'm not around. What should we do about that? I could just keep an eye on him.”

“If we can make it like the door to my room that was made yesterday, we could just rent a private room and put a door there. Of course, we would remove the door when we leave.”

<b>

So, I can just rent an inn as a base.

I see. When I think about it, that makes sense and is natural.

<b>

Even if we’re isolated from the outside world during the journey, if I think of it as being on a ship, I have no complaints, and if it's safe, that's even better.

<b>

<b>

“Then, shall we add more rooms? Like a bath! A field could be nice too!”

“Oh, then, um, could you add a toilet near the room? Running to the pirate hideout is far.”

“A toilet, got it. I’ll make that right away. Let’s use the one we have at the hideout.”

<b>

My scavenger slime is for women, so Dia-kun can't use it. I see, he was using the toilet at the hideout.

<b>

“I plan to use the boat we took from the pirates to make the bath. But since the bottom isn’t flat, it might shake a lot. What should I do?”

“...Um, how did you manage with the sea where the pirate ship was floating? The sea is still there now.”

“Huh? Well, I just made the ground sink—oh. If I do it the same way, I won’t need to use the boat. I see, you're really smart, Dia-kun. Good boy, good boy.”

“D-don't treat me like a child... mmm.”

<b>

When I pat his head, Dia-kun squints his eyes happily despite complaining. So cute.

Additionally, I can easily adjust the temperature of the bath with spatial magic. I can also separate and remove water impurities.

Well, it seems like I’ll be in charge of the bath.

<b>

Making a sauna would be nice too. A cold bath as well. Hehe, this is going to be fun!

<b>

<b>

“Um, Karina-onee-san. You mentioned a field earlier, but can we really make one?”

“Yeah. We can let sunlight in through the windows, and we can bring in soil and water from outside. We can buy seeds and even transplant fruit trees from the forest if we want.”

<b>

We could even create a field outside and have a direct door to it.

Buying land in some town could also be an option.

<b>

“Anything is possible with your magic, onee-san.”

“That's right, anything is possible. It's magic given to me by the gods.”

“To save the world, this much power is necessary, huh?”

<b>

Well, it was excessive even for torturing the self-proclaimed chaos god. Yeah.
