# I don't feel bad, man.

Room was created within the storage space.

Well, I've been with Dear for a long time now, so I've accumulated a lot of things. There are things you can't do unless you are alone!　Phew. I'm glad the soundproofing is perfect.

<blank>

Woohoo ...... good morning."

"Oh, good morning, sister Karina. ......, please put on your clothes, clothes!"

<blank>

Deer with a red face. Oops, I was in my underwear. I'll show you something unflattering ...... No. Is it a reward to see your first love's sister in her underwear?　I see. I don't feel bad. I'm going to go change.

<blank>

Well, I'm on my way to Solacidore, and I have a few days left. I'm on my way to Solacidore, so I have a few days left.

?"　What do you mean?"

Yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually."

<blank>

That Karina Shonin was suspicious because she had previously moved from Solasidore to Velarde in an instant. He explains that Karina Shonin had already left Velarde.

<blank>

I see that you can move between towns in an instant at ......."

I'm not sure I'd be able to do it myself. So, well, as a matter of fact, sending Mr. Kumin back home could be done in an instant if I did it. I wouldn't."

I think it's better not to do it. Once you do that, there is no limit to how far you can go.

<blank>

Well, I'm not stingy if you pay for the transportation, but I don't know how much I should get or anything.

<blank>

I'm thinking of doing some things to enhance the base for a couple of days," he said!　Oh, and what about your ID?　I completely forgot about it.

The first thing you need to do is to get an ID card. But if I want to match my sister as a merchant, I should either go to the Adventurer's Guild or the Merchant's Guild to make my ID card, or ...... I could even become a slave.

<blank>

Slaves. ...... Dear you!

It's so immoral to enslave such a pretty girl, that's what it is.

<blank>

'Well, well, let's not have slaves. Maybe the Adventurer's Guild is fine, it's cheaper."

Then let's register at Solacidore's."

<blank>

It would be good to form a party as a normal adventurer and leave it as a help.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to do about that. What should I do about that? I can watch him all the time.

If it can be done in the same way as the door to my room that was made yesterday, why don't I just get a private room at an appropriate inn and put the door there? Of course, the door would have to be removed when we move out."

<blank>

So I can just rent a regular inn and use it as a base?

I see. If you think about it, that's natural and natural.

<blank>

Even though they are isolated from the outside world on the road, they have no complaints considering it's like being on a boat, and if it's safe, so much the better.

<blank>

<blank>

'Well then, let's add another room. Like a bath!　Or maybe a field!"

Oh, well, then I'd like to see more restrooms near my room, ...... it's too far to run to the pirate hideout."

Toilet. Got it. I'll make that in a minute. We'll use the slime from the safe house.

<blank>

My scavenger slime is for women, so I can't use it on you, Dear. Oh, I see, you used the bathroom at the hideaway.

<blank>

The bath is going to be built using a boat we took from the pirates. But the bottom isn't flat, so it's going to rattle and shake.

...... How did you get to the sea where the pirate ships floated?　There's still just the sea."

What?"　That's by denting the ground. If we do it like that, we don't even need to use a boat. I see. You're a smart boy, Deere. Good boy, good boy.

Don't treat me like a child. ...... nn

When I patted his head, Dia-kun complained but squinted his eyes happily. He is so cute.

In addition, I can easily adjust the hot water level by adjusting the temperature of the space magic. Separation and removal of dirt from the water is also possible.

Well, if that happens, I guess I'll be the bath attendant.

<blank>

I like the idea of building a sauna. And a water bath. Hmmm, I'm making progress!

<blank>

<blank>

Excuse me, Karina-san. You mentioned a field earlier, can you grow a field too?"

Yes," he said. We can let sunlight in through the windows and bring in soil and water from outside. We can buy seeds and other things to make them, or we can transplant fruit trees from the forest if we want.

<blank>

It would be good to have a direct access door to the farm or something outside.

I guess I could buy land in some town.

<blank>

Anything is possible, sister magic."

I'm sure anything is possible. God gave me this magic.

So this is how much power you need to save the world."

<blank>

Well, it was overkill to mess with an old man who called himself a chaos god. Yeah.
