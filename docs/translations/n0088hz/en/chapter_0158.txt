# Hey, you there, dwarf. Don't look at Dia-kun's thighs under his skirt.

"Though it's a bit late to say this after selling it, it's less convenient than a rapier. Please consider it only for self-defense or emergencies."

"Okay!"

<b>

First, you can only fire up to 6 rounds loaded in the revolver at once, and reloading has a big opening.

(Still, being able to fire 6 shots in a row seems to be revolutionary.)

<b>

Now, with fixed power, it's difficult to hold back, but since the wounds are small, you can't cause instant death unless you hit well.

Not being able to cause instant death against monsters is a bit of a concern. It's also weak against being surrounded. Indeed, this feels unreliable as a main weapon.

<b>

Well, I have spatial magic, so it's not a problem for me.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Then, we started testing the handgun and adjusting the grip.

<b>

"I thought it was a spare, but you're giving a gun to Aisia too. ...Are you out of your mind for giving a gun to a slave?"

"Because I trust her."

"Well, that's fine. But still, there's one left over. Is a dragon going to use it?"

"Of course not. I'm going to use two guns. One in each hand."

"Is that really sane? Even though it's quite reduced, the recoil will mess up your hands."

<b>

Well, I plan to manage that with magic.

<b>

"Oh, right. Don't throw away the used empty cartridges if you can help it. They can be reused."

"Huh? Is that so?"

"If you had to come all the way here to buy them every time you ran out of bullets, that would be a hassle, right? If you show the dwarves an unused bullet as a sample, they can make and set the bullet heads. Of course, doing it in this village is the best."

<b>

Wow... I might not have needed to buy bullets for a gold coin.

They say that firing an empty cartridge will only produce a sound like an explosion. ...The mechanism for the explosion is in the cartridge, I see.

<b>

"Be careful, as leaving it to someone clumsy can lead to accidental discharge."

"Oh, but is making money okay? You mentioned something about continuous income."

"Huh? Only dwarves can properly make bullet heads. You should be making money."

<b>

Ah. I see. The unit of earning is based on race.

...Fundamentally, the sense of scale is different from humans.

<b>

<b>

While I was adjusting the gun on the second floor, Dia-kun and Aisia, who had finished their adjustments first, returned after their test firing. They were with the dwarf instructor (Aisia's brother).

<b>

"Ugh, the impact is quite strong, isn't it? ...Even holding it with both hands, my hands hurt."

"I feel the same. I need to be careful, or it will interfere with my housework."

<b>

If it gets bad, I'll heal it. Don't hesitate to tell me if anything happens.

<b>

"With the power it has, the recoil can't be helped. With such delicate hands, it's bound to be tough."

"...Um, excuse me, big brother? Could you let go of my hand?"

"Oh, sorry. I've never seen such white and tiny cute hands before."

<b>

Hey, you there, dwarf. Don't touch Dia-kun's hands.

<b>

"For now, let's put the guns away. Hmm, thigh holster... looks cool."

"W-Wait! What is a girl of that age doing? At least have some modesty!!"

<b>

Hey, you there, dwarf. Don't look at Dia-kun's thighs under his skirt. (Second time in 10 seconds)

<b>

"Hey, Aisia. Hasn't Dia-kun conveyed that he's a boy to your brother?"

"I told him, but he said, 'There's no way such a cute kid is a boy,' and wouldn't listen."

<b>

Well... I guess that's understandable. Dia-kun is cute after all.

<b>

"Uh, um. If you don't mind, there's a drinking party after this. Would you like to joinâ€”"

"Hey, I'll shoot you, you lustful dwarf."

<b>

Oops, I accidentally interrupted.

<b>

"W-What? I'm trying to flirt with this kid right now. When you see a good woman, you invite her for drinks, right?"

"Dia-kun is uncomfortable, and this kid is mine in the first place. Shoo, shoo."

"Then please, give her to me!! In exchange, I'll give you anything I have!!"

"Should I seriously shoot this guy?"

<b>

If I were short-tempered, I'd be meeting the same fate as a certain false chaotic god at this point.

<b>

"Hey! Don't disturb the guests! Get lost, you idiot!"

"B-But, Dad! I've never felt such a sense of destiny with someone... for the first time! I'm serious!"

"Um, I'm a boy..."

"Hahaha, you're good at jokes, Dia-san... Ouch! Ugh!"

<b>

Oops, before I could pull the trigger, the village chief hit him on the head and kicked him out of the room.

<b>

"...Um. As a service, I'll let you shoot the test bullets for free, so please forgive me."

"Alright. I'll shoot about 1000 rounds to relieve stress."

"Ah, you can shoot as many as you want since I'll have that guy remake the used bullets."

<b>

The village chief scratched his head, saying he had properly taught that if you touch the mates of outsiders, you can't complain if you get killed. 

Come on, teach your son more properly!!
