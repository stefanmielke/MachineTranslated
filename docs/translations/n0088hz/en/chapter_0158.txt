# Hey there dwarf. Don't look at your thighs in your skirt, Dear.

I don't want to say this after I sold it, but it's not as useful as a rapier. Consider it for self-defense and emergency use only."

Yes."

<blank>

First of all, the revolver can only fire six shots at a time, and reloading is a huge gap.

(Still, it's a breakthrough, apparently, to be able to do six in a row.)

<blank>

The fixed power makes it difficult to go easy on them, but the wounds are small enough that they can't kill you instantly if you don't hit them hard enough.

The fact that it cannot be killed instantly against demons is a bit of a concern. It is also weak against being surrounded. This is certainly not a good weapon to use as a main weapon.

<blank>

Well, I have spatial magic, so that's not a problem.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, I had to test fire the pistol and adjust the grips.

<blank>

I thought it was just a backup, but they let Isiah have a gun too? Are you insane to give a ...... slave a gun?"

I trust you."

I'm not sure. So, I still have one gun left over. Is the dragon going to use it?"

No way. I'm going to do two guns. Double-handed."

"That's insane.　Even though it's pretty well mitigated, the recoil will still break your hand."

<blank>

Well, we plan to do a little bit of magic there.

<blank>

Oh, yes," he said. Don't throw away used empty shell casings if at all possible. They can be reused."

What?" Really?"

"Wouldn't it be a problem if we had to come here every time we ran out of bullets?　Dwarves can make and set warheads by showing unused bullets to the sample. Of course, it's best to do it right here in the village."

<blank>

Heh, ...... bullets, maybe I'm glad I didn't buy a single gold coin's worth.

They said that if you shoot an empty shell casing, it will be an empty gun with only a bursting sound. I see that the mechanism of ...... explosion is in the shell casing.

<blank>

"If you leave it to someone who's not very good at it, you run the risk of an outburst, so be careful."

That." But is the money-making good?　You said something about continuous income."

Hmm?"　Only dwarves can make warheads properly. You've earned it."

<blank>

Ah. I see. The unit of earning is just the species.

......Fundamentally, you have a different sense of scale than humans.

<blank>

<blank>

While I was adjusting the second gun, Dia and Isiah, who had finished the adjustment earlier, came back after finishing the test shooting. They were accompanied by their instructor, Mr. Dwarf (Isiah's brother).

<blank>

'Ugh, it's quite a shock. ...... my hands hurt even when I hold it with both hands."

I, too, have to be careful with this or it will interfere with my housework."

<blank>

I'll fix the worst there. If you need anything, don't hesitate to tell me.

<blank>

The recoil is inevitable because of the power of the weapon. It's not going to happen with such a slender hand."

"...... Um, brother?　May I take my hand away?"

I'm sorry. It's because I've never seen such a white, dicky, pretty hand before."

<blank>

Hey, you dwarf. Don't touch Deer's hand.

<blank>

'Let's put the gun away for now. Hmmm, thigh holster ...... cool."

Bubba, you idiot!　What's a girl your age doing? You should be ashamed of yourself!

<blank>

Hey there, dwarf. Don't look at Deer's thighs in her skirt. (for the second time in 10 seconds)

<blank>

Hey, Isiah," she said, "doesn't your brother know you're a man? Doesn't your brother know you're a man, Deere?"

"I told him, but he wouldn't listen, saying, 'There's no way this cute girl is a guy.

<blank>

That's ...... no way to go about it. Deer, you're so cute.

<blank>

Hey, hey. I'm having a party after this, if you want to join me--"

"Hey, I'll shoot you, you rutting dwarf."

<blank>

Oops, I interrupted unintentionally.

<blank>

What the hell? I'm hitting on this girl right now. When you see a nice girl, you ask her out for a drink, right?"

She doesn't like it, and she's mine to begin with. Shush."

I'll give you whatever I have in exchange!　I'll give you anything I have in exchange!

I'll shoot you dead, you son of a bitch."

<blank>

If I had a temper, I'd end up like a certain fake god of chaos at this point.

<blank>

Hey!　Don't bother our guests!　Stay out of this, you idiot!"

But, Dad, I've never been with someone I feel so destined to be with!　This is the first time I've ever ...... been with someone I feel such a sense of destiny with!　I'm serious!"

Um, I'm a guy. ......

"Haha, you're good at jokes, Dia-san. ...... Ada!　Bubbe!"

<blank>

Oops, before I could pull the trigger, the satocho smacked me on the head and kicked me out of the room.

<blank>

...... that. Forgive me if I give you free unlimited trial rounds for your service."

I'm going to shoot a thousand rounds at you to relieve the stress. I'm going to shoot a thousand rounds at you to relieve some stress."

He said, "Yeah, I'll have him remake the bullets we used. I'll have him remake the bullets I used, so you can shoot all the bullets you have in stock."

<blank>

The village head scratches his head and says, "I taught him well that if you touch someone's tsugai, you can't complain even if you get killed.

Oh my God, you should have disciplined my son better!
