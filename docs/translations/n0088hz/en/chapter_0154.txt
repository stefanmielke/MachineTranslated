# Is there really such a fool?

<b>

After spending a night in the town of Rosetta, several barrels were scattered around the living room of the storage space base.

<b>

"Hey, Aishia, what's with those barrels? You can't mean they're all alcohol?"

"Huh? Don't be silly, Master. This is juice, juice!"

"So, that means it's alcohol."

<b>

It seems Aishia, who had been shopping in town, brought back a large quantity of alcohol.

With this amount of alcohol, it would undoubtedly be an illegal transaction without a license. The gray area is too outrageous; the dwarven country is fearsome.

<b>

But where on earth did she get that much money――

<b>

"I used the gold coins I received as payment for treating a slave trader as a healer the other day."

<b>

――That's right. The other day, I fulfilled my promise with the slave trader Sorashidore and provided the monthly treatment.

Five gold coins for each of the five people. A profit of 25 gold coins with no initial investment.

<b>

So, since I earned that much, I thought it would be wrong to make Aishia work for free, even if she is a slave, so I gave her five gold coins.

<b>

"Wait, I thought that was supposed to be pocket money for Aishia?"

"Please consider it as funds I can use freely for Master. Besides, it's complicated to think of it as pocket money when it's enough to buy me five times over."

<b>

Yeah, and Aishia effectively got it for free with the cashback.

<b>

"Hey, Karina. Gold coins aren't something you give to slaves as pocket money."

<b>

I was lightly tapped on the head by Mashiro-san.

Oh, welcome. You were here. Just finished your bath?

<b>

"Well, because if Aishia isn't here, I can't be a healer, right? It's important to give rewards to ensure loyalty, you know?"

"Are you stupid? If a slave has gold, they'll just buy themselves back. Thank goodness Aishia is loyal."

"That's right. I love Aishia."

"I love you too, Master!"

<b>

Aishia and I hugged tightly. She smelled faintly of alcohol. Did she just have a drink?

<b>

"By the way, Mashiro-sama. Do you think there's a fool who would betray knowing Master's power? Even if they escape to the ends of the world, they'll be caught in an instant and face retribution?"

"......There are some unbelievable fools in this world, so I'll keep that comment to myself."

"Even Arthur the dragon understands and swears loyalty..."

"Dragons are actually smart. It's an insult to compare them to unbelievable fools."

<b>

Mashiro-san gazes off into the distance. Is there really such a fool? Maybe in the beastman country.

<b>

"Master, could you create a storage room for these barrels? Oh, and please make it one that progresses over time. The longer it ages, the tastier it gets."

"Okay, I'll make it. By the way, where should I move all the barrels? Is the kitchen fine?"

"Hey, you're spoiling the slaves right after saying that, Karina... Well, I guess it's too late to expect common sense. You did make a stray dragon your pet after all."

<b>

Mashiro-san scratches her head. Arthur-kun raises his head and looks over, as if to say, "Did you call for me?" I didn't call you, so just sit down.

<b>

"Well, since we're going to Aishia's hometown, it would be better to have some gifts, right?"

"......The dwarven village, huh? Be careful, especially with Dear-kun. Never take your eyes off him. He'll get eaten, in a sexual way. By a man, no less."

<b>

Wha, seriously? Dear-kun is mine, so I absolutely have to guard him...

...No, that's not it! He's a precious child entrusted to me by Sister Cumin, so I have to protect him properly! Yes!

<b>

<b>

With that, we left the town of Rosetta with some gifts in hand and decided to stop by Aishia's hometown.

On the way? There were no dragon attacks or anything like that, so there's nothing special to talk about.
