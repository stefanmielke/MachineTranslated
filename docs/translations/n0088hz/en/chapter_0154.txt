# There you are, you damned fool.

<blank>

After a night in the town of Rosetta, I found several barrels strewn about in the living room of the storage space base.

<blank>

What's with the barrel, Isiah? Don't tell me it's all alcohol?"

What?　I don't like it, Mister Aruji. This is juice, juice!

That means alcohol.

<blank>

It seems that Isiah, who had her shopping in town, has bought a large quantity of liquor.

This amount of alcohol, unlicensed, is definitely illegal to trade. The gray area is too outrageous, fear not, Dwarf Nation.

<blank>

But where in the world would that money--

<blank>

'I used the gold coins I received the other day as a reward for treating a slaver as Mr. Healer.

<blank>

- - it was. I had recently fulfilled a promise to a slaver in Solacidore and gave him his monthly treatment.

5 gold coins per person for 5 people. A rags to riches profit of 25 free gold coins in the original.

<blank>

I thought that if she earned that much money, it would be a good idea to let her work for free, even though she was a slave, so I gave her five gold coins.

<blank>

What, that was supposed to be spending money for Isiah?"

I would like you to let it be the money that I can spend freely for you. Or rather, it is complicated if you give me an allowance that can buy me five times."

<blank>

Yeah, and with the cash back, it's practically free, isn't it, Aisia?

<blank>

"Hey, Karina," he said, "you don't give gold coins to slaves for spending money, do you? Gold coins aren't supposed to be given to slaves for spending money in the first place."

<blank>

Mr. Masiello poked me in the head with a knack.

Welcome. You're here. After your bath?

<blank>

I'm not going to do it without Isiah. Without Isiah, Mr. Healer wouldn't be able to do what he does, would he?　It's important to reward her so she won't betray you, okay?"

You are an idiot. If a slave had money, he would buy himself back. You're lucky Isiah is loyal to you.

I love you," she said. Isiah, I love you."

Me too, Sir!

<blank>

Me and Isiah hugging each other tightly. I can smell the slight odor of alcohol. You've had a little bit to drink, haven't you?

<blank>

I mean, Mashiro-sama. Do you think there is a fool who knows the power of the Anji-sama and betrays him?　Even if he escapes to the end of the world, he will be caught and retaliated against in an instant, don't you think?"

There are some very stupid people out there, ......, so I'll leave it at that."

Even Arthur the Dragon understands and pledges his allegiance to ......."

I think dragons are smart. It's rude to compare them to these idiots."

<blank>

Mr. Masilo with a faraway look in his eyes. Are you there, you pompous idiot? In the land of the beastmen or something.

<blank>

I am asking you, "Sir, may I ask you to build me a storage room for these barrels? May I ask you to make a cellar for these barrels?　Oh, please use the type that time passes. It's the kind that tastes good as it ages."

I'll move all the barrels while I'm at it. Where do you want to put the doors?　In the kitchen, I guess.

"Hey, you've spoiled your slaves too much by saying so, Carina,......, well, it's too late for common sense now, isn't it? You even turn stray dragons into pets."

<blank>

Mr. Masilo scratches his head. Arthur, you called yourself? He tilted his head and looked at me. I didn't call you, so sit down.

<blank>

Well, we're going to Isiah's hometown, so we might as well bring a souvenir.

'...... Dwarf village, huh? Be careful, okay?　Especially Deer Boy. Never let him out of your sight. They will eat you, sexually. And by a man."

<blank>

Gee, seriously. Deere, you are mine, so I definitely have to guard you: ......

...... No, that's not what I mean!　She's a precious child entrusted to us by her sister Kumin, so we have to protect her well!　I'm sure you're right!

<blank>

<blank>

And so, after leaving the town of Rosetta with our souvenirs, we decided to stop by Isiah's hometown.

On the road?　There were no dragons attacking me, and I don't have much to say about that.
