# Five Great Elders' Workshop (Perspective of the Five Great Elders)

The workshop of the Five Great Elders has been completed at Karina's base.

It is a dream workshop that surpasses ideals, created by each of the five Great Elders after hearing about Karina's abilities.

<b>

A furnace and potion bottles with perfect insulation created by spatial magic walls.

<b>

A space with stable temperature and humidity.

Although flowers have not yet bloomed, there are flower beds that recreate the climate of each season.

<b>

A clock that tells the time with millisecond precision.

Sunlight and moonlight constantly pouring in from the skylight to a fixed position.

<b>

An infinite warehouse that can store as many materials and manufactured goods as desired.

Moreover, one can easily reach their favorite shelf from the workspace.

<b>

A leave function that can stop time in the space when work is interrupted.

Meals can always be grabbed as "freshly made leftovers," and fresh, clean water can be used endlessly――

<b>

"Wow... this is amazing... incredible!"

"Is it really okay for us to use something like this?"

"Wow, the sunlight from the skylight is dazzling, and the full moon is beautiful!"

"This is amazing, it's an unbelievable sight. I'm so moved!"

"I can mix potions as much as I want... I can just reach out and take what I need without going to the warehouse...!"

<b>

Things that would be nice to have but are impossible have become a reality.

<b>

"By the way, Vermilion. It's a bit late to ask, but isn't interfering with time a taboo?"

"Karichan has permission from the gods, so it's okay."

"If it's approved by the gods, then it's safe! ...It's a shame we can't accelerate time, though!"

<b>

Although it's a taboo set by the gods, that same god has told Karina it's okay to use it.

There's nothing to be afraid of.

<b>

"That said, it would probably be bad if we made magical tools that interfere with time."

"I don't even understand the theory."

"I don't want to get kicked out of this workshop, so I won't touch it."

<b>

No, there was one thing. Being kicked out of this workshop.

There's nothing else to be afraid of!!

<b>

<b>

"Oh, everyone. Congratulations on the completion of the workshop. Are there any issues?"

<b>

At that moment, the elf boy, Dia, appeared.

Today, he's wearing a dress that Karina likes. His silver-haired ponytail is dazzling.

<b>

"Oh! Dia-kun! So far, there are no issues!"

"You look cute today too, Dia-kun. Want some candy?"

"Thanks to being allowed to design the workshop first, we can start operating right away!"

"We'll start making various things right away, but let me know if there are any problems!"

"We'll create wonderful things together!"

<b>

The Five Great Elders gathered around Dia, excitedly chatting.

The sight of the loli dwarves surrounding the boyish elf would have made Karina grin foolishly.

<b>

"Just don't make anything too dangerous, okay?"

"「「「「「...We, we understand!」」」」」

<b>

The Five Great Elders were cautioned.

Unlike Karina, who would be easily swayed if they acted spoiled, Dia was firm on such matters.

<b>

Although the Five Great Elders are favored by Karina, they can feel that Dia's love and trust surpass theirs. It's a woman's intuition.

If Dia and the Five Great Elders ever had conflicting opinions, Karina would likely side with Dia.

Even when searching for a compromise, Dia's opinion would likely carry more weight.

<b>

In essence, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that Dia holds the highest authority in this base of Karina. The Five Great Elders recognized this.

<b>

That said, it wouldn't be beneficial to oppose that.

Rather, they wanted to shower Dia with affection alongside Karina.

In reality, Dia is cute, doesn't do bad things, and is willing to make sufficient concessions.

Even if they created something that shouldn't be revealed, as long as it stays hidden, they would likely be forgiven.

<b>

So, for now, there are no complaints, and above all, Dia is just too cute.

<b>

Honestly, it's only natural for a grandmotherly feeling to arise, wanting to do something for Dia, who is cuter than a real grandchild. The Five Great Elders, after all, are practically grandmothers in dwarf terms.

<b>

"Alright, then let's get the Five Great Elders' workshop started! The first project will be Dia-kun's dress! Everyone, let's go!"

"「「「「Oh!」」」」"

<b>

<b>

Thus, the finest craftsmen poured their best techniques into creating the best item, but its performance was so exceptional that it could not be revealed, as it was suitable for having a picnic elegantly on a battlefield filled with flying arrows, so it was promptly shelved.
