# Five Great Old Workshops (Five Great Old Perspectives)

The workshop of the Five Elders was completed at the base in Kalina.

A dream workshop beyond the ideal, created by five of the Five Elders who each heard of Kalina's abilities.

Furnaces and potion bottles with full insulation built up with space magic walls.

<blank>

Space with stable temperature and humidity.

Although the flowers have not yet bloomed, some flowerbeds reproduce the seasonal climate.

<blank>

A clock that tells time accurately to the millisecond.

Sunlight and moonlight always pouring into place through the skylight.

<blank>

An infinite warehouse that can store any number of materials and manufactured goods.

Moreover, you can access any shelf you want with a light reach from your work area.

<blank>

A leave function that allows the user to stop work for an entire space of time when interrupting work.

Freshly prepared meals can be picked up at any time, and fresh, clean water is available for unlimited use.

<blank>

"Wow ...... this is numbing ...... amazing!"

This thing ...... is really, really okay for us to use?"

"Wow, the sun is dazzling through the skylight, and the full moon is beautiful.

It's amazing. It's an unbelievable sight. I'm so moved.

"You can mix as much as you want ...... without having to go to the warehouse every time you want to reach in and get it out ......!"

<blank>

I wish there were, but there isn't, and I've made a number of them a reality.

<blank>

'By the way, Vermillion. I thought it was forbidden to interfere with time after all this time?"

Kari said it's okay because God gave her permission.

I'm glad to hear it's God-approved! It's too bad we can't accelerate for ...... hours, though!"

<blank>

It's a taboo that God has decreed, but that God says Kalina is allowed to use it.

There is nothing to be afraid of.

<blank>

However, it's probably not a good idea for us to make magic tools that interfere with time, right?

I don't even know what the theory is to begin with."

I don't want to mess with you and get kicked out of this workshop, so I won't touch you."

<blank>

No, there was only one thing. It was to be kicked out of this workshop.

There is nothing else to fear!

<blank>

<blank>

Ah, folks. Congratulations on the completion of your workshop. Are there any glitches?"

<blank>

And then Dia, the elven man's daughter, appeared.

Today she is in a one-piece dress, which Karina prefers. The nape of her neck dazzles in her silver-haired ponytail.

<blank>

Oh!　Dia-kun-chan!　Not at the moment!"

You're so cute today, Deere. Do you want some candy?"

Thanks to the fact that they let me design the workshop first, we'll be up and running in no time!"

I'll make some things right away, but I'll let you know if there are any problems.

We will make something wonderful with everyone's help.

<blank>

The Five Elders are excited to be surrounded by Dia.

The way the loli dwarves surrounded the man-daughter elves would have made Karina slack-jawed if she had seen them.

<blank>

"Don't make anything too dangerous, okay?"

「「「「「......Wah, I know, I know. 」」」」」

<blank>

The Five Elders are nailed to the floor.

Unlike the easygoing Kalina, who is always willing to be swept along if you ask her to do something sweet, Dia is very firm in this area.

<blank>

Also, he is a Five Elder who is favored by Kalina, but he knows firsthand that his love and trust cannot be matched by Dia. It's called a woman's intuition.

Perhaps, when Dia and the Five Elders disagree, Kalina will take Dia's side.

Even if we are trying to find a way to drop the matter, Deere's opinion will largely prevail.

<blank>

In effect, it is no exaggeration to say that Dia has the highest power in this Carina base. The Five Elders were aware of this.

<blank>

Nevertheless, there is no good in rebelling against it.

I would rather adore Dia with Karina with gusto in the direction of loving her.

She's actually cute, she doesn't do anything wrong, and Deere herself makes enough concessions.

If you make something that cannot be shown, they will forgive you if you don't show it.

<blank>

So, so far, I have no complaints, and after all, it's all about the cuteness.

<blank>

To tell the truth, I can't help but feel a bit like an old woman who wants to do something for Dia, who is cuter than her own grandchildren. The Five Elders, in fact, are grandmothers in the Dwarves' eyes.

<blank>

Okay, let's start the workshop of the Five Elderly!　The first work is Dia's dress!　Let's get to it, everyone!

「「「「 Oh! 」」」」

<blank>

<blank>

The best craftsmen put their best techniques into the product, and the performance of the product was such that it could not be shown off to the extent that one could have an elegant picnic on the battlefield with arrows flying around, so it was immediately put in storage.
