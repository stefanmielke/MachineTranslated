# Star engines

I'm home.

<blank>

Look at you, sister!"

I'm very proud of it, Sir!

<blank>

The engine blueprint he showed me was a star-shaped engine with five pistons arranged in a star shape around a shaft. It was a star-shaped engine with five pistons arranged in a star shape around a shaft.

Wow, I taught them the basics, but they developed a star engine. On Earth, this engine was used for reciprocating airplanes and so on.

<blank>

With a single piston, it seemed impossible to tell which way the rotation would start when starting from the maximum or minimum, so I thought that placing multiple pistons to intentionally disrupt the equilibrium would solve the problem."

Then I suggested a meteor design, and this is what we came up with!"

<blank>

The drawings indicate that, if built properly, it would be possible to make something that works stiffly.

These things may not work if they are not accurate, but if I am processing them with spatial magic, that is not a problem either.

In other words, this is a perfect engine drawing.

<blank>

By pulling each other, the pistons don't have to move in both directions, and each only has to move in one direction. ...... Theoretically, a single goblin magic stone can also move. I'm not sure how fast this would work."

<blank>

And since it is a magic tool that only does basic piston work, the fuel consumption will be quite good. Rotational magic tools use a lot of energy to increase their output, don't they?

<blank>

......You look like you're itching to try something real, don't you?"

Yes!　Please, sister Karina!"

<blank>

Sure, I'm a sucker for a pretty girl's request, Carina.

Let's make a model as soon as possible. Eeeeee space magic craft. Wow!

<blank>

It's a wooden model, but that's about it. I printed the circuit of the magic circle.

Oh, sister, you work fast!"

As one would expect from you!"

Then I'll set the goblin's magic stone."

<blank>

A single magical tool consisting of five pistons connected together. I placed a small magic stone the size of my pinky toenail on it. Although it was a small stone, the shaft rod began to spin around and around without any problem.

<blank>

"...... really worked!　It turned!"

We did it, Mr. Dear!　We have won!"

<blank>

I don't know what they were fighting with. Dia-kun and Aisia showed their joy by high-fiving each other. Do you want to join us, onee-san?　No, thank you.

<blank>

Or rather, it was an unexpectedly powerful rotation. I tried gripping the stick to test it, but it finally stopped after gripping it and stepping on it with a lot of force. I wondered if it was possible to generate such a high rotational speed and torque with a single piece of scrap magic stone. ...... Isn't that revolutionary?

<blank>

"Oh, ......, you just heard a cracking sound, didn't you? Did the piston break?"

Mhm. Is a tree so thin that it can't withstand the output? That's amazing."

<blank>

It was a torrent at one point. Hmmm, this makes me want to make it with stronger materials.

I would rebuild it in stone. Natural stone would be sturdier than wood. I would like to make it with metal for stickiness and such, but this is fine for now.

I moved it in the same way and tried to stop it by gripping it - again, with a lot of force, it finally stopped. This time it did not break.

<blank>

If it's not good, you can peel the skin off your hands. That's a lot of power."

It's true," he said. I would say it was a great success.

<blank>

Moreover, if you stack two or three more of the five star-shaped ones on top of each other, the power will simply increase by itself. If you put gears on it, it must be able to rotate at a considerable speed.

<blank>

<blank>

Why are we ...... so stumped that we're developing an engine when all we had to do was make a dummy magical tool!

<blank>

I also came up with a magic circle to be placed inside the wagon. It is a magic circle that is meant to amplify the rotation. I thought it could be fooled even if it was very fast because the amplification is eight connected. I don't know if it will work for the real job, but ......"

Here, around here, it's my suggestion, a wind and fire design!"

<blank>

Ah, not only the engine itself, but also the fake magic circle inside the cart!

I must have been out for less than half a day and your job is perfect!

<blank>

Damn, that's because you and Deere are even better than I thought!　And cute!

This should be a reward for both of you. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Okay, so I'll make a special treat for you both: ...... It's a pancake party today!"

I'm looking forward to it!　I'm looking forward to it!"

Thank you, Aruji-sama!"

<blank>

The model of the star engine was slightly modified to become a mixer, which was very useful for stirring pancake mix.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I found the ingredients list for the pancake mix on the ...... box, so I might be able to make it myself if I use that as a reference. I'll need to get some baking powder, though.
