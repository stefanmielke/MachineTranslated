# Star-Shaped Engine

<b>

<b>

I'm back!

<b>

"Look, big sister!"

"It's my masterpiece, Master!"

<b>

The engine design that was shown to me. It was a star-shaped engine with five pistons arranged in a star shape surrounding the axis.

Wow, I taught them the basics, but these two have developed a star-shaped engine. This type of engine was used in reciprocating aircraft on Earth.

<b>

"I thought that with a single piston, it wouldn't be clear whether it would start rotating from the maximum or minimum, so I arranged multiple pistons to intentionally disrupt the balance."

"And I proposed the design of a meteor, which led to this shape!"

<b>

Looking at the drawings, it seems like if made properly, it could actually work.

Such things often don't work if the precision is poor, but since I can process it with spatial magic, that's not a problem.

In other words, this is a perfect engine blueprint.

<b>

"By pulling against each other, the pistons don't need to move bidirectionally; each only needs to move in one direction... theoretically, it can be powered by just one goblin magic stone. I don't know how fast it would go, though."

<b>

Moreover, since it's a magical tool that only does basic piston work, the fuel efficiency should be quite good. Rotational magical tools consume a lot of energy to increase output.

<b>

"...You look eager to try the real thing, don't you?"

"Yes! Please, Karina big sister!"

<b>

Sure, I'm weak against the requests of cute kids.

Let's make a model right away. Here we go, spatial magic crafting. Chowa!

<b>

"It's a wooden model, but this should be it. I've printed the circuit for the magic circle too."

"Oh, big sister, you're so quick with your work!"

"As expected of Master!"

"Now, let's set the goblin magic stone."

<b>

A magical tool with five connected pistons. I placed a small magic stone the size of a toenail on it. It was a small stone commonly referred to as a junk magic stone, but even so, the axis began to spin without any issues.

<b>

"...It really moved! It spun!"

"We did it, Dia-sama! It's our victory!"

<b>

I don't know what we were fighting against, but Dia-kun and Aishia expressed their joy with a high five. Can I join too? Yay!

<b>

By the way, the rotation is surprisingly strong. I tried holding the rod, but it took quite a bit of effort to grip and stop it. Can such a high rotation speed and torque really be achieved with just one junk magic stone? ...Wait, isn't that revolutionary?

<b>

"Ah... I just heard a crack. Did the piston break?"

"Hmm. It seems the thin parts can't withstand the output when made of wood. Amazing."

<b>

I was using Trent wood, after all. Hmm, in that case, I want to make it out of a stronger material.

I remade it using stone. Natural stone should be sturdier than wood. I want to use metal for its durability, but for now, this will do.

I moved it similarly, gripped it, and tried to stop itâ€”again, it took quite a bit of effort to finally stop. This time, it didn't break.

<b>

"If I'm not careful, my skin might peel off from this. Such power."

"That's true. We can definitely call this a great success."

<b>

Moreover, if we stack five star-shaped ones two or three high, the power will simply increase. If we add gears, we can surely achieve a considerable rotation speed.

<b>

<b>

...Wait, we only needed to make a dummy magical tool, so why are we seriously developing an engine!?

<b>

"By the way, I've also thought of a magic circle that seems to be installed inside the cart. It's a magic circle designed to amplify rotation. Since it's connected in eight, it should be able to disguise even a considerable speed. I don't know if it would fool the professionals, though..."

"This part here is my suggestion for the design of wind and fire!"

<b>

Ah, not just the engine itself, but even the disguise magic circle inside the cart!

I haven't even been gone for half a day, and yet the work is perfect!!

<b>

Damn it, it's all because Dia-kun and the others are more talented than I thought! And they're cute!

I must reward these two...!

<b>

<b>

"Alright, then I'll make a special treat for you two... today is a pancake party!"

"Wow, big sister, you can make sweets too? I'm looking forward to it!"

"Thank you, Master!"

<b>

By the way, the model of the star-shaped engine was slightly modified and became a mixer, which was very helpful for mixing the pancake batter.

<b>

<b>

<b>

...Since there was an ingredient list for the pancake mix on the box, I might be able to make it myself if I refer to this. I need to get baking powder, though.
