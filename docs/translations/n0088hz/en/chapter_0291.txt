# What happened!?

<b>

The moment the god bit into the maid homunculus's socked foot.

<b>

――A shock ran through as if the world had cracked.

<b>

"ッ！？ Wh-what is this!?"

<b>

Immediately after. The sock was pulled away from the maid homunculus's foot, and the god stepped back with a pale face.

<b>

"…Ugh! My body…"

"Eh, wh-what? God? What happened!?"

"I feel like I'm being stirred around… Th-this power…! No way!"

<b>

The god crouched down. And seeing this, Kaoru smirked.

Then, Kaoru's hair color gradually turned red.

<b>

"Well done, Lena. Thank you for your hard work, Karina-chan."

"Yes, my master."

"…!!"

<b>

In that moment, the interaction with the 'Chaos Demon King' resurfaced in my mind.

<b>

"Chaos…!!"

"Ah, it's fine now, just call me the Chaos God."

<b>

With a snap, hearing the sound of fingers snapping made my memories even clearer.

<b>

Yes. I was manipulated by the Chaos God, carried the maid homunculus, who had been counterattacked, to the god as the 'mastermind', and was made to offer harmful socks to the god.

I was being controlled by the Chaos God to make it happen, to do it. So much so that I didn't even realize I was being manipulated. I was being toyed with.

<b>

And so, the god, deceived by such me, ended up being made to eat the poisoned socks.

<b>

"Don't worry, as promised, from now on I'll also act as your SP, and I'll create appropriate items for you. After all, I'm the god of alchemy, so I can easily create divine artifacts, and of course, I can create items to conceal divine artifacts."

<b>

I see, that's why the god judged that the maid had "no divine artifacts."

<b>

In reality, she must have had 108 genuine divine artifacts made by the Chaos God. Among them, there must have been a 'divine artifact to conceal divine artifacts.' That makes sense.

<b>

<b>

The Chaos God approached the crouching god.

<b>

"Hehehe, now then. How does it feel, Time-Space God-chan? How does it feel to have your divine power sealed from within your body?"

"Ugh… My stomach…"

<b>

The next moment.

The god suddenly lunged at the Chaos God with incredible speed and held on tightly with both hands and feet. …Like a cicada?

<b>

"It’s so funny that it feels like my stomach is twisting! Ahaha♪ It's the Chaos God!"

"！？ W-wait, how can you move, Time-Space God-chan!?"

<b>

The god began to rummage through the Chaos God (Kaoru, whose hair had turned red), stroking and sniffing her body odor, leaving bite marks. I quietly distanced myself from the two.

Ah, hello, maid homunculus. Are you also taking shelter? We're both having a tough time.

<b>

"Why! I should have eaten the poisoned socks!?"

"Eh? No way. I was just pretending to eat them, P-PRETENDING! I know very well that the Chaos God likes me so much that she wants to seal me and make me her pet!"

"N-no! I just want my freedom!"

"Yes, yes. I understand. I understand. That's why I'm not giving you up! I don't want anyone but my own Chaos God, ufufufufu."

<b>

Wow. That’s a yandere vibe. Isn’t that why the Chaos God avoids the god?

<b>

"Ugh, I was properly deploying the 'Koshori-kun'…!"

<b>

Ah, speaking of which, wasn't there a story that if I used 'Koshori-kun', the god wouldn't see me?

So you were watching, huh? Breaking promises is not allowed, God!

<b>

"Karina-chan. Do you remember the exception for 'Koshori-kun'?"

"Ah, um… It was something like 'except in emergencies,' right?"

"You remembered well! So, what kind of emergency did I say would allow peeking?"

"Um, if there’s been no contact for about ten years, or if the god's lover comes to visit—!!"

<b>

That's right. If the god's lover comes to visit, I would peek even with 'Koshori-kun.'

The god had said that from the beginning.

<b>

"Yes! So this time was an emergency!!"

<b>

Ugh, an exception for prior application processing! Then it can't be helped.
