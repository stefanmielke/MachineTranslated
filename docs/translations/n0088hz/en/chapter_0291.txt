# What's wrong with you!

<blank>

The moment when God bit into the footed sock of the maid homunculus with a snap.

<blank>

-a shock that felt like a crack in the world.

<blank>

What?　This, this, what?

<blank>

Immediately after. Socks, the mouth is removed from the foot of the maid homunculus and God backs away with a blue face.

<blank>

"...... ugh!　My body is ......"

"What, uh, what?　God?　What's going on!"

"I feel like I'm being stirred up in a round and round ...... This is the power of ......!　No way!

<blank>

God cowering. And when Kaoru saw this, he raised the edge of his mouth with a nyi.

And Kaoru's hair color gradually turns red.

<blank>

Well done, Lena. Good job to you too, Karina."

"Yes, my Lord."

"......!!!!"

<blank>

At that moment, the exchange with the "Demon Lord of Chaos" came back to my mind.

<blank>

"Chaos ......!!!"

Oh. That's enough with the God of Chaos."

<blank>

My memory becomes even clearer when I hear the sound of a clap and a tap of the fingers.

<blank>

Yes. I was forced to carry a maid homunculus, whose memories had been tampered with by the god of chaos and returned to him as the "mastermind," and to offer him a pair of socks that would harm him.

It was manipulated by the Chaos Gods to be so, to do so. As if they didn't even know they were being manipulated. They were being manipulated.

<blank>

And so, God was deceived by me, and I was made to eat poison socks with a whimper.

<blank>

I'll take the place of SP from now on, as I promised, and I'll also make appropriate items for you. As the god of alchemy, I can easily create divine artifacts and items to conceal them.

<blank>

Okay, so God looked at the maid and decided that she didn't have any divine gifts.

<blank>

In fact, it would have been a mass of divine artifacts, with 108 real divine artifacts handmade by the God of Chaos. Among them, there must have been a "sacred artifact that conceals a sacred artifact". It makes sense.

<blank>

<blank>

The god of chaos approached the cowering god.

<blank>

I'm not so sure. How do you feel about it, God of Time and Space?　How does it feel to have your divine power sealed from inside your body?"

"Crap ......, my tummy is ......"

<blank>

The next moment.

God jumped on the god of chaos with a very fast movement and held him with both hands and feet. Is it a ...... cicada?

<blank>

I'm laughing so hard I feel like my stomach is going to curl up in knots!　Haha♪ It's the God of Chaos!

What?　Why can't you move, God of Time and Space?

<blank>

God, I put my hands into the clothes of the God of Chaos (Kaoru with reddish hair) and stroked them, enjoying their body odor, kumquatting and tooth marks. I quietly moved away from them both.

Ah, hello maid homunculus! Are you evacuating too?　It's tough on both of us, isn't it?

<blank>

Why?　I thought I ate the stocking stuffer!"

What?　Oh no. I'm just pretending to eat it, Hu, li!　I know exactly how much you love me, God of Chaos, so much that you want to seal me up and make me your pet!

No, no!　I just want my freedom!"

Yeah, yeah. I know. I know. That's why I won't give it to you!　I don't like it if you're not my own personal God of Chaos.

<blank>

Wow. Sounds like a Yandere. Isn't this why the God of Chaos avoids God?

<blank>

Damn, I was properly deploying Mr. Cotchery ......!"

<blank>

Oh, I thought you said that if I used Mr. Koshori, I wouldn't see God?

You've been watching me, haven't you?　You can't break a promise, God!

<blank>

'Karina-chan. Do you remember your exception, Mr. Cossioli?"

Oh, let's see. ...... except in emergency situations, was it?"

I remember well!　Now, what emergency would you have said you would peek at?"

Let's see...you haven't been heard from in about 10 years, or God's lover is playing--!!!"

<blank>

That's right. When God's lover goes to play, he will peek even if Mr. Koshori is there.

God said so from the beginning.

<blank>

Yes!　I mean, this time it was an emergency!"

<blank>

Damn, an exception to the prior application process!　Then it can't be helped.

<blank>
