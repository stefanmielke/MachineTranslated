# No, no, that's not good!

"My dual magic guns are incredibly versatile!! The synergistic effect of the two bullets is boundless, tracing infinite trajectories! And they can fire in rapid succession!"

"Ugh! How troublesome! ...Moreover, the power to pierce through my fur armor is exceedingly bothersome! And they can fire in rapid succession!!"

<b>

For now, I’ll say something that sounds appropriate while creating smoke and continue shooting. I pierced through his arm from the side.

Moreover, the loud popping sounds will surely be tough on the ears of a wolf beastman with good hearing.

<b>

"I never expected the dwarven weapons to have evolved this much...!"

"Ku ku ku, I bought it in the dwarven village! For purchasing inquiries, please head there!"

"Did you come here to promote weapons!?"

<b>

For now, I fired six shots each, a total of twelve shots from both hands. I could reload with spatial magic, but here, I’m focusing on looking cool with the reload action!

With a clank, I unfolded both guns, dropping the spent cartridges from the revolver—oh wait, this gun's body was also the cartridges. I properly collected them.

Then I inserted them into the holster on my back and, without looking at my hands, loaded six shots × 2, for a total of twelve shots using the bullets I retrieved with spatial magic!

And once again, I held them in my hands, reload complete! Time taken—10 seconds!!

<b>

"...How about that?"

"Aren't you full of openings?"

"If that's the case, you should have taken advantage of those openings. Thanks for just watching?"

"To be honest, I was a bit mesmerized."

<b>

Oh. So you really like the gun that much. It is cool! A person who understands.

<b>

"...Hmm, I've decided! I will win against you and show that I can obtain it!"

"Why not just buy it normally?"

<b>

Don't try to steal someone else's weapon, General.

The elf's bow that I broke earlier was just weapon destruction, so that doesn't count. I returned it properly after the match. Though it was in a broken state.

<b>

"Huh? Can I buy it?"

"It was three gold coins. If you want two guns, that's six coins. Plus, there's the cost for the bullets."

"No, I meant your story, not the weapon."

"!? You want to buy me!? ...Ha! Bring me 100 gold coins!!"

"If that's all it takes, I can pay that."

<b>

Crap, the 100 gold coin joke doesn't resonate! This general has some guts...

<b>

"No, never mind. If I win, I plan to get 820 gold coins. 100 coins is too cheap."

"Then I'll offer 1000 gold coins. Become my wife."

<b>

The general boldly declares.

...1000 coins. But I really don't want to be this general's wife. If I were to become a bride, I'd prefer Mashiro-san. Rather, I'd rather marry all the Five Elder Lords and Dia-kun.

<b>

"...Nope, I'll pass!"

"I see. Then it seems I have no choice but to propose with my strength!! ...I've bought enough time and have recovered."

<b>

General Garou cracks his neck. Has the wound from earlier already healed? What remarkable recovery! Or is it just stubbornness?

<b>

"By the way, why did we suddenly start talking about marriage?"

"Huh? That's because I genuinely found you appealing. Besides, with that much of a pheromone scent, what do you expect? Even though you're human, you smell just like a female wolf in heat?"

<b>

Isn't this what they call marriage hunting? The general tilted his head slightly.

...That's it! It's Mashiro-san's scent!!

<b>

"That's a misunderstanding, you jerk!! That's the scent of my friend!!"

"What!? So it's between females!? No, no, that's not good! A child can't be born from that! Someone as strong as you has a duty to increase the bloodline!"

"Shut upーーーー!! That's none of your businessーーーー!!"

<b>

I fired twelve bullets in two seconds, creating numerous wind holes in General Garou's body.

I'm glad I had a gun; if it were barehanded, I might have accidentally missed my aim.
