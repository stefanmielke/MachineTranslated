# No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

My two magic guns are ever-changing!　The synergy of the two bullets is unlimited, and they have infinite trajectories!　And they can fire in rapid succession."

Nuh!　How nasty! ...... Moreover, the power to pierce my hair armor, it is the nastiest of all!　And you can fire it repeatedly!

<blank>

At any rate, he said something like that and shot more, while smoking it out. He pierced his arm from the side.

Moreover, the banging noise is so loud that it would be enduring to a Blutbad with good ears.

<blank>

I never thought dwarven weapons could be so advanced. ......!"

I bought it at the dwarf village!　Please come there to discuss your purchase!"

You're here to advertise weapons, aren't you?

<blank>

At any rate, I hit off 6 rounds each, 12 rounds in each hand. I could have reloaded with spatial magic, but this is a reloading action for the sake of coolness!

With a click, he deployed both guns and dropped the casings in the revolver - but the casings were also the main body of the gun. I retrieved it properly.

He then inserted it into the holster on his back side and loaded 6 x 2 or 12 rounds of ammunition that he took out of his hand with space magic, without looking at his hand!

Then, again in hand, reload complete!　The time - 10 seconds!

<blank>

"...... doh!"

There's a lot of openings, isn't there?"

'Then you should have taken advantage of the gap. Thanks for watching me like a normal person?"

I have to admit, I was kind of smitten."

<blank>

Wow. You like guns that much? It's cool!　You're a guy who knows what he's talking about.

<blank>

"...... Hmmm, I've made up my mind!　I will beat you and get it!"

Why don't you just buy a regular one?"

<blank>

Don't try to rob people of their weapons, General.

The elf's bow I broke earlier was just a weapon destroyed, so no problem. I returned it after the match. It was broken.

<blank>

I said, "Mm?　Can I buy one?"

I paid three gold coins. And I have to pay for the bullets.

No, I'm not talking about the weapon, I'm talking about you.

!"?　You want to buy me!　...... Ha!　Bring me 100 gold coins!!!!"

If that's all you want, I'll pay you."

<blank>

Oh no, the 100 gold coins story isn't getting through!　Generals are so worthwhile. ......

<blank>

I'm going to get 820 gold coins if I win. If I win, I'm going to get 820 gold coins, and 100 was too cheap."

'Then I'll give you 1,000 gold coins. Be my wife."

<blank>

The general says it out loud and proud.

......1000 piece. But I don't want to be this general's wife. I would rather have Mr. Masilo as my wife. I would rather have all the Five Elders or Mr. Dia as my wife.

<blank>

......Yeah, I guess I'll have to decline!"

I see. Then, after all, you'll have to woo them with your arms! ...... I've bought myself some time, and I'm back on my feet."

<blank>

General Garou rattles his neck. Has the wound from earlier already healed? Or is he just skinny?

<blank>

I mean, why the sudden talk of courtship?"

Mm?"　That's because I really thought you were desirable. What is the matter with you now after you have made me smell so much of heat? You are a human race, but you are a she-wolf in heat.

<blank>

Isn't this what you call a marriage activity?　the general tilted his head lightly.

...... it!　That's the smell of Mr. Masiello!

<blank>

'You misunderstand me, you son of a bitch!　That's the smell of my tootsies!"

What?　You mean, "female-to-female"?　No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　You can't have children!　A strong man like you has a duty to increase the blood supply!

"Shut up!　Mind your own business!

<blank>

I fired off 12 bullets in two seconds, blowing all the wind out of General Garowe's body.

Good thing I had a gun, if I had been bare handed I might have inadvertently gone crazy with my hands.
