# Well, that was careless of me

<b>

At the innermost part of the dungeon, beyond a barrier, lies a black sphere. That is the dungeon core.

<b>

Since I have the dungeon core, I wonder if I should try to copy it and take a duplicate home.

...Huh? Not copyable? Ah, I see, it's a divine artifact. What a shame.

<b>

"This is tied to life, so I can't collect it, huh...?"

<b>

However, the object that was stuck to the back of the core could be copied.

What is this, a magical tool? Is it a device to control the core?

<b>

"Hey, what's that thing behind the core?"

"Behind the core? What are you talking about?"

<b>

Oh, I guess it can't be seen from the corridor side. I showed the copied object to Mashiro-san.

<b>

"There was something just like this stuck to the back of the core."

"This is... a bomb!?"

"A bomb, is that a thing? Is it set up to destroy the dungeon in case of emergency?"

"Idiot! There's no way that's true! If the dungeon is destroyed, this town is finished!"

<b>

Oh. That makes sense, doesn't it?

Just then, Mashiro-san pushed me against the wall with a thud.

A serious gaze. A close face. I can even hear the sound of her breath.

...Whoa, that made my heart skip a beat. She's so cool... Wall slams are actually nice...

<b>

"Hey, Karina! Is that really attached to the back of the core!?"

"Uh, yeah. Should I remove it?"

"If you can, then do it!"

<b>

With a quick motion of my fingers, I activated spatial magic. The bomb transferred to my hand.

<b>

"Here you go, is this good?"

"...I have to ask, can you really remove it!?"

<b>

Of course I said it because I could take it off. Obviously, I can.

<b>

"Alright, then let's take that back and have the guild check it out. They might know something."

"Is it safe? Won't it explode on the way?"

"Ah, that's possible. What should we do...?"

<b>

Mashiro-san is thinking. ...Alright, I'll lend a hand.

Let’s see, when I scan it, it connects like this, and this part... Ah, this must be the explosive part? It feels like a magical bomb? It seems to be filled with magical power.

Then I just need to remove this part. Partial transfer.

<b>

"Okay, I've separated the explosive part from the rest."

"Thanks... wait, seriously? You're amazing, magician."

"You can praise me more, you know?"

"No, seriously, it's amazing, but all I can say is that it's amazing."

<b>

I see, it's so wonderful that there are no words to describe it. Mmm.

<b>

"But is it really okay to remove it without permission? What if some monster comes out again?"

"It should be fine. Probably."

<b>

Yeah, Mashiro-san doesn't really get it.

<b>

"They were hiding it secretly because they felt guilty. Plus, if we ask the guild and it turns out to be a problem, we can just put it back, right?"

"That's true."

<b>

As an A-rank adventurer, she can take responsibility for her actions. What a cool lady. I like her.

If Mashiro-san calls out to me, I’ll help her out.

<b>

"Well then, I'm heading back, so I’ll leave the rest to you, Mashiro-san."

"Wait, wait, wait. I'm going back too, of course I'm going with you. By the way, tell me about the new route Karina found. If I'm going to explain, I need to know how to guide you."

<b>

Oh, I was planning to return via teleportation, but now that she mentioned it.

Since I'm leaving the explanation to the guild to her, I need to properly pass on the information to Mashiro-san.

<b>

So, we will return through the path we came from, but I decided to ask Mashiro-san about something that was on my mind.

<b>

"By the way, is there a return portal or something?"

"Not in this dungeon, but there are dungeons that have those. It's the kind that lets you teleport back to the entrance instantly after breaking through the boss room."

"Really, those exist?"

<b>

I can't believe they actually exist. Not in this dungeon, though.

...The theory that dungeons are wielders of spatial magic seems quite plausible. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

Later, when I returned with Mashiro-san to the entrance of the dungeon, there was a situation where they said, "There's no entry record, where did you come in from!?" So, my trusty five-yen coin ID made a comeback, but that's a story for another time. Well, that was careless of me.
