# Oh no, inadvertently inadvertently inadvertently inadvertently inadvertently inadvertently inadvertently

At the far end of the dungeon, at the end of the warded passage, is a black ball. That is the dungeon core.

<blank>

The dungeon core, I might make a copy of it and bring back a duplicate since it's a good opportunity.

...... hmm?　No copies allowed?　Oh, yeah, you're talking about a divine device, right? Too bad.

<blank>

"This is tied to my life, so I can't collect it, can I ...... hmm?"

<blank>

However, the object attached to the back of the core could be copied.

What is this, a magical device?　Is it a device to control the core?

<blank>

Hey, what's that behind the core?"

'Behind the core?　What are you talking about?"

<blank>

Oops, can't you see it from the aisle side? I showed the copied object to Mr. Masiello.

<blank>

I found one just like this one flopping on the back of the core."

This guy is a ...... bomb!"

I wonder if they are there to destroy the dungeon in case of an emergency. I wonder if they are planted to destroy the dungeon in case of emergency."

You idiot!　How can that be?　If the dungeon is destroyed, this town is finished!"

<blank>

Oh. That too, huh?

And then Mr. Masilo donned me up against the wall and wall-banged me.

A serious gaze. A close face. You can even hear the sound of their breath.

...... Oh man, I'm so excited. Cool ...... wall-donning was a good thing ......

<blank>

Hey Karina!　Is this guy really behind the core!"

"Uh, yeah, sure. Do you want me to take it off?"

If you can take it off, take it off!"

<blank>

With a flick of my finger, I activated spatial magic. The bomb was transferred to my hand.

<blank>

Yes. Is that all right?"

"I'm sorry to tell you ......, but you really can't take it off!"

<blank>

I said that because I can take it off, of course I can.

<blank>

All right, let's take it back to the guild and have them take a look at it. Maybe we can find out something.

"Are you okay?　Won't it blow up on the way out?"

Oh, it's possible. What shall we do? ......"

<blank>

Mr. Masilo thinking. ......Okay, let's get some skin in the game.

Let's see, if I scan it, it's connected here like this, and it's like this, so ...... Oh, is this the explosive part?　It's like a magic bomb?　It looks like it's filled with magic power.

Then, we can just take out this part. Partial transfer.

<blank>

Yes, I've separated the explosive and non-explosive parts."

"Oh, thankyou, ......, you're for real. That's awesome, wizard."

More compliments are in order, okay?"

No, seriously, it's amazing, but all I can say is, "Wow!"

<blank>

I see. So it is wonderful beyond words. Hmmm.

<blank>

But are you sure this is the one you should have removed on your own?　What if some more monsters pop up?"

I'm sure it'll be fine. Maybe."

<blank>

Yeah, Masilo, you don't understand this one.

<blank>

He was so guilty that he secretly hid it in the back of the house. Besides, why don't we just go to the guild and ask them, and if it doesn't work, why don't we just go back to the guild and reattach it?

That too."

<blank>

You say that because you are an A-rank adventurer and can take responsibility for your own actions. You are a handsome lady. I like her.

If Mr. Masiello calls on me, I'll help him out too.

<blank>

I'll leave you to it, Mr. Masiello.

Wait, wait, wait. I'm going home too, of course I'm going with you. Tell me about the new route Carina found. If I'm going to explain, I have to be able to guide you.

<blank>

Oops, I was planning to leave in transition, but as they say.

To the extent that we are going to throw the explanation to the guild, we need to make sure that we hand over the information to Mr. Masilo.

<blank>

So, we are returning from the dungeon by going back the way we came, and I ask Masilo about something that has been bothering me.

<blank>

Come to think of it, is there such a thing as a return portal?"

There are some dungeons that have that kind of thing. You know, the ones where you can instantly jump to the entrance after breaking through the boss's room?

"Yes, there is."

<blank>

I didn't think it was really there. Not in this dungeon though.

...... I still think the theory that Dungeon is a spatial magic user is a strong one. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea.

<blank>

<blank>

Later, back with Mr. Masilo, at the entrance to the dungeon, "There's no entry record, where did you come in from!" and so it is between us that the universal ID card of a five-yen coin has been in use for a long time. Oh well, careless carelessness.
