# Magic tool store

(I'm rewriting 7 episodes that I've been quietly saving up, so I may lose my daily updates soon.)

I'm Karina!

I beat the pirates in a drinking contest!　Foul play?　No, space magic is totally legal because it's my external stomach too!

<blank>

So I left the merchant guild in a pleasant mood and returned to the storage space under the pretense of leaving the door of the merchant guild, as I did not take lodging today.

<blank>

After one night, the next day, I had to leave the merchant guild again.

<blank>

I think I'll stock up on lotions today."

<blank>

The cost of the alcohol bought by the merchant guild was about 15 silver coins. This is after deducting the amount given to Harumikazuchi-sister and used by Braid-senpai in negotiations, so it is safe to say that there was quite a profit.

Saty-tan, did you perhaps give me a great deal of service?　I'll have to thank you next time I see you.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, that's how I'm going to stock up on lotions: ......

The handling is a magical tool store.

<blank>

It is a magical store!

<blank>

Speaking of grimoire stores in other worlds, that's romantic."

<blank>

I wish I could make and play with magical tools too. It's useful - magical tools.

What, you think you can do anything you want with spatial magic?　That's not--

<blank>

Fire magic tools?　You could put the fire in the space magic!

A magical tool that produces water?　You could put the water in a spatial magic!

A glowing magical tool?　We could put light in spatial magic, right?

<blank>

<blank>

--That's for sure!　God's spatial magic is too cheat!

<blank>

<blank>

No, well, as expected, there are even magical tools that can do what spatial magic cannot.

Spatial magic is just like an extension of your own limbs. That means I can't use it on anyone else. When you have someone other than me as your friend, you will have many uses for it.

<blank>

And that's why you can't make lotions.

Yes, there must surely be a lot of unknown possibilities in magical tools!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Open the door of the grimoire store and go inside.

From the outside, the store looked suspiciously like just a house with a sign, but the interior was very much like a general store.

I have some small items lying around that I don't know what they are used for, and they don't have price tags on them. What in the world are these unfamiliar bumpy things and such used for ......?

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I heard from the merchants' guild that you can buy lotions here.

<blank>

I call out toward the back of the store. Several times I asked, "Excuse me?　Moshi moshi," a man who seemed to be the owner of the store came to me.

<blank>

"Oh, come here. We make lotion at home. How much do you buy?"

'Uh, as much as you can afford?　Ah, but only after I see the quality."

Yeah, this guy is the sample."

<blank>

The owner puts a sachet on the counter. Inside is a white powder. He lightly licks his little finger to wet it, puts the powder on it, and licks it off.

...... hmmm, I don't particularly taste or smell it, probably a superior product.

<blank>

I'm starting to feel like we're exchanging naughty drugs in this transaction, aren't we?

Maybe it's a little outlaw-like, maybe it's cool.

<blank>

I like it. Here, what's your price?"

One bag is one silver coin. How much are you buying?"

<blank>

Hmmm, one silver coin. That's the same amount as the purchase price offered by Sister Harumikazuchi, isn't it? That's not enough to make a profit. ...... Rather, it would normally make a loss due to expenses.

I thought about duplicating it for a moment, but that was against my bindings, so I didn't do that.

Let's bargain honestly here.

<blank>

"Ummm, I'll buy 30 silver coins at once, can't I get a little cheaper?"

<blank>

We have about 50 silver coins in our fund. Considering that we also handle other items besides lotions, I would say that this is about the amount we can buy.

<blank>

No, it's not. It is a powder of such high quality that no one else carries it. If you think I'm lying, ask the merchants' guild.

I've got a life to lead!　We have lives here too!"

...... hmmm, I don't know what to do."

<blank>

As I said this, I could see his eyes glancing at my breasts.

Is that it?　If I let you rub my boobs, do I get a 10% discount or something?

<blank>

If you don't mind, I'm willing to let you rub my tits all over Obachan in exchange for some fruit milk, okay?　As a former man, I know the gravitational pull of boobs!

<blank>

Hmmm, I don't know what to do."

Can ...... somehow make it cheaper?"

Hmmm, I don't know what to do."

<blank>

Hey, I'm starting to look at the gun instead of glancing at it. I crossed my arms to somehow hide my chest.

Are you waiting for me to say it by any chance?

I would have let you rub it in if you were honest, but ...... this isn't happening! Cowards.

<blank>

I'm going to buy some magic tools. This is a grimoire store, right?"

"...... Oh, yes, I do. I can give you a ten percent discount if you combine it with the grimoire."

<blank>

Good. Then - and depending on the price of the grimoire.

<blank>

By the way, what kind of magical tool is this and how much does it cost?"

<blank>

He points to the bumpy magical tool that was there earlier.

The owner ponders a bit, "What's that ......? Hey, you better get a grip on it, it's your product.

<blank>

Oh, I remember now. That's a magical tool to cut parchment into specific shapes. It's a silver coin."

A particular form?

Put it on a piece of parchment and cut it in the shape of the outline of the grimoire. You see, it's a square and it's oriented just right.　Then you press the top button, and it cuts it out at that size.

Shouldn't ...... scissors do the trick?"

'That's why they're unsold. I'd appreciate it if you'd buy it."

I see.

<blank>

Maybe this grimoire store isn't in style?

(Also, I enjoyed "Scissister Hunter.")
