# Magic Tool Shop

(I've been quietly rewriting the seven episodes I've saved up, so the daily updates might soon come to a halt.)

<b>

I'm Karina-chan!

I won a drinking contest against a pirate! Cheating? No way, spatial magic is just my external stomach, so it's completely legal!

<b>

So, feeling good, I left the merchant guild, and since I didn't book a room for the night, I pretended to exit through the guild's door and returned to my storage space.

<b>

The next day, after a night had passed, I decided to leave the merchant guild again.

<b>

"Today, I think I'll stock up on lotion."

<b>

The amount I received for the alcohol bought from the merchant guild was about 15 silver coins. Excluding what I gave to Sister Harumikazuchi and what Blade-senpai used for negotiations, I can say I made quite a profit.

Sati-chan, did you perhaps give me a significant discount? I should thank you next time we meet.

<b>

<b>

Now, with all that said, I'm off to stock up on lotion...

The shop I’m dealing with is a magic tool store.

<b>

It's a magic tool store!!

<b>

"When it comes to magic tool shops in another world, it's just so romantic."

<b>

I want to create and play with magic tools too. They're so convenient, right? 

What? You think spatial magic can do everything? Well, that's—

<b>

A magic tool to start a fire? Just put the fire in spatial magic!

A magic tool to produce water? Just put the water in spatial magic!

A magic tool that emits light? Just put the light in spatial magic!

<b>

<b>

—That's true! The god's spatial magic is way too overpowered!!

<b>

<b>

Well, there are certainly magic tools that can do things that spatial magic can't.

Spatial magic is more like an extension of my own limbs. That means it can't be used by others. When I have companions besides myself, there will be many uses for it.

<b>

After all, I can't make lotion with it.

Yeah, there must be countless unknown possibilities with magic tools!

<b>

<b>

<b>

I opened the door to the magic tool shop and stepped inside.

From the outside, it looked like just a suspicious house with a sign, but the interior was very much like a general store.

There were small items whose purposes I couldn't discern scattered around, and there were no price tags. What on earth are these oddly shaped things used for...?

<b>

"Ex-excuse me! I heard I could stock up on lotion here from the merchant guild!"

<b>

I called out towards the back of the shop. After a few attempts of "Excuse me? Is anyone there?" a man who seemed to be the shopkeeper came over.

<b>

"Ah, welcome. Lotion, huh? We make it here. How much do you want to buy?"

"Um, as much as I can? Ah, but I want to see the quality first."

"Ah, here's a sample."

<b>

The shopkeeper placed a small bag on the counter. The contents were a white powder. I lightly licked my pinky to moisten it, then dipped it in the powder and licked it.

...Hmm, I don't particularly taste or smell anything; it's probably high quality.

<b>

This transaction is starting to feel like I'm exchanging illicit drugs, isn't it?

It might be a bit of an outlaw vibe, which is kind of cool.

<b>

"Sounds good. What's the price?"

"One bag for one silver coin. How much are you planning to buy?"

<b>

Hmm, one silver coin. That's the same price that Sister Harumikazuchi offered for buying it. That wouldn't yield any profit... In fact, under normal circumstances, it would result in a loss.

For a moment, I considered duplicating it, but that would go against the rules, so that's a no-go.

Let's just go for straightforward price negotiation.

<b>

"Hmm, since I'm buying a total of 30 silver coins' worth, can you lower the price a bit?"

<b>

My funds are about 50 silver coins. Considering that I plan to handle other items besides lotion, I propose this amount as a reasonable purchase.

<b>

"That's not happening. This is high-quality powder; you can't find it elsewhere. If you don't believe me, ask the merchant guild."

"Please, just this once! I have a living to make too!"

"…Hmm, what should I do?"

<b>

While saying that, I could see his gaze flickering towards my chest.

Is he thinking that if I let him touch my breasts, I could get a 10% discount or something?

<b>

If he wants to touch the breasts I exchanged for fruit milk with the auntie, I wouldn't mind letting him, you know? As a former man, I understand the allure of breasts!

<b>

"Hmm, what should I do?"

"…Can’t you make it cheaper?"

"Hmm, what should I do?"

<b>

Hey, he's not just glancing anymore; he's staring now. I instinctively crossed my arms to cover my chest.

Could it be that he's waiting for me to say something?

To be honest, I would have let him touch them... but no way! What a coward.

<b>

"Then, how about I buy some magic tools too? This is a magic tool shop, right?"

"…Ah, that's right. If you buy magic tools along with it, I can give you a 10% discount."

<b>

Alright. In that case—well, it depends on the price of the magic tools.

<b>

"By the way, what kind of magic tool is this, and how much does it cost?"

<b>

I pointed at the oddly shaped magic tool from earlier.

The shopkeeper pondered for a moment, saying, "What was that again...?" Hey, you should know your own products better.

<b>

"Ah, I remember! That's a magic tool that cuts parchment into a specific shape. It costs one silver coin."

"A specific shape?"

"You place it on the parchment and cut it into the outline of the magic tool. See, you can place it just right for a square, right? Then, if you press the button on top, it will cut it out in that size."

"…Isn't that just scissors?"

"That's why it's still unsold. It would help if you bought it."

"I see?"

<b>

Could it be that this magic tool shop isn't doing well?

(Just between us, the web manga "Limit Break Sensual Activity Osamu" is really interesting.

Also, "Sushi Sister Hunter" was fun too.)
