# Maid Homunculus

<b>

When I opened the door to the bedroom where the maid homunculus was waiting, there stood a black-haired, red-eyed maid who was in the process of taking off her maid outfit.

<b>

"Master, I've been waiting for you—oh, a new one, I see. And tied up too. Are you hoping for a 3P, or rather, a 4P SM play today?"

"Hey! Don't mess around, you cat! If you value this guy's life, surrender now—!!"

<b>

Misha stepped forward, using Kaoru as a shield, while the maid tilted her head and looked at us, still in the process of undressing.

<b>

"R-Reina. I've been captured. Please surrender quietly."

"Oh no! Master! What a situation, you've been taken hostage! Understood, I won't surrender..."

<b>

The maid homunculus stood up obediently and smoothly adjusted her disheveled maid outfit.

She raised both palms and waved them gently.

<b>

"Alright, just stay calm... huh? Did you just say you won't surrender?"

"I did say that. I'm more of an S type, you see. I prefer to tie people up."

"…D-Do you not care what happens to this guy!?"

"No, no, please surrender, Reina! Do you not care what happens to me!?"

"It's fine, I won't die from something as trivial as that. Even if I become dice-sized, I'll be just fine—yes, with alchemy, of course!!"

<b>

Bam! The maid homunculus posed with a thumbs up while winking. She seems surprisingly playful.

<b>

"Are you really not going to surrender no matter what?"

"？ Is Master really captured? With that cut rope?"

"Karina, you figured it out! I'm going for it!"

"Alright, it's time for some real action. It's my turn now!"

<b>

Ultimately, it was a shallow thought. Kaoru's act of being captured was quickly exposed.

<b>

"Don't move, stop!"

<b>

I fixed the maid homunculus's body in space. Not a single joint should be able to bend—at least, that was the plan.

<b>

"Oh my, how naive you are."

<b>

And the maid was behind me. I instinctively jumped forward to create distance. Is spatial magic ineffective?! This one is really strong!?

<b>

"That was spatial magic, wasn't it? Don't worry, I've prepared for it—yes, with alchemy, of course!!"

<b>

Once again, bam! The maid homunculus winked. Damn, you're so relaxed! ...Wait, Kaoru? How long are you going to stay tied up?

<b>

"…Hey, this won't come off!"

"Oh, the rope was all frayed, but I tied it up securely with the intact parts."

"Did you not listen to the plan, you stupid cat!?"

"Huh? Isn't it normal for something like this to tear apart?"

"Is this cat also a musclehead!? Are you two a musclehead duo!!"

<b>

How rude, don't lump me in with Misha. I used spatial magic to cut Kaoru's ropes.

<b>

"Reina! I'm telling you to quietly submit! For once, listen to your master's orders! You're a maid, right!?"

"Master. I'm sorry, but I can't comply with that request. Because I'm an S type. You should know that well from our time in bed, right?"

"Ugh."

"That aside, spatial magic. So, it seems you are indeed the customer in question."

<b>

The maid's mouth curved into a crescent-shaped smile.
