# Maid Homunculus.

<blank>

When I opened the door to the bedroom where the maid homunculus was waiting, there was a black-haired, red-eyed maid who was in the process of removing her maid's uniform.

<blank>

"We are waiting for the master--oh, he is a new boy. And you are tied up with it. Would you like threesomes, or even foursomes, SM play today?"

"Hey!　Don't play dumb with me!　If I want to spare his life, I'll give up!

<blank>

Misha takes a step forward with Kaoru as a shield against the maid, who looks at her and nods her head while she is about to take off her maid's uniform.

<blank>

"Hey, Lena," he said, "they got me. I've been captured. I want you to surrender."

Ahh!　Master!　Oh my God, Master has been taken hostage!　All right, I will not surrender. ......

<blank>

The maid homunculus quietly stands up and quickly puts back on her bare maid's uniform.

Raise both palms and wave them flutteringly.

<blank>

"Okay, just stay calm and ......?　Did you just say you won't surrender, Nya?"

I said?"　I'm more of an S person. I prefer to be tied up."

"......, I don't care what happens to this guy, Meow!"

'No, no, surrender, Lena!　You don't give a shit what happens to me!"

Don't worry, you won't die from a normal death. It's okay if you turn into the size of a dice--yes, with alchemy!

<blank>

Bachiko!　The maid homunculus winks while posing with a thumbs up. He seems to be a more mischievous guy than I thought.

<blank>

'You're not going to surrender no matter what?'

?"　Is the master caught in the first place?　With that slit rope?"

'Carina, they knew!　Let's do it!"

I'm going the use-of-force route. I guess it's my turn!"

<blank>

It's all just an idea. Kaoru's pretense of being caught was easily exposed.

<blank>

Don't move, stop!"

<blank>

I fixed the body of the maid homunculus in space. Not a single joint could be bent - or should have been.

<blank>

Well, well, well, you are sweet."

<blank>

And the maid was behind him. I quickly jumped forward to get distance. Spatial magic doesn't work?　This guy is really strong!

<blank>

'That was spatial magic, wasn't it?　Don't worry, it's taken care of--yes, if it's alchemy!"

<blank>

A lid bakko-kon!　and winking maid homunculus. Damn, you can afford it, you! ...... is that Kaoru?　How long are you tied to the rope?

<blank>

"...... hey, this thing won't come off!"

Oh, the rope was a bit shabby, but I tied it up tight.

"Didn't you hear the plan, you stupid cat!"

What?　Isn't it normal to be torn to pieces like this?"

'This cat's got brains, too!　Brain duo, you guys!"

<blank>

Don't be rude, don't lump me in with Misha. And I will cut Kaoru's rope with my spatial magic.

<blank>

"Lena!　I told you to get yourself into a noose!　You should listen to the Lord's orders once in a while!　You're a maid!

Master. I'm sorry, but I can't ask you that favor. Because I am an S. Don't you know that in bed, Master?"

Ugh."

"Aside from that, spatial magic. So, it seems that you are our customer.

<blank>

The maid's mouth smiled like a crescent moon.
