# Capital city Akahagane ●Illustration Ari

<blank>

The capital city, Akahagane. The town was built by hollowing out half of a huge mountain.

It is said that the town began as a crater created by a meteorite that fell on the mountainside and was developed as a mine. Perhaps that is why the air is a bit dusty and rough.

<blank>

The gouged-out mountain like a sundial looks like it might collapse at any moment, but I heard that the first king managed it with magic. ...... Magic is amazing.

<blank>

<blank>

The town is still dwarf-sized overall.

On the other hand, stores for other species have large entrances, but most of the stores on the main street were like that, so this place looks like a normal town to me.

<blank>

The gatekeeper seemed upset.

It's probably because of the gifts that my grandmothers gave me," he said. If anyone sees it, they will immediately recognize it as a gem."

I don't want to take it off if I want to avoid a fuss. ...... but it's a nice present and I don't want to take it off!"

<blank>

These items were handmade for me by the five grand elders, who are cute little girls (by my standards).

Even though spatial magic would be nearly useless, it would be polite to at least keep it on while we are in this country!　Perhaps!

<blank>

What?　You think it will come back even if you take it off?

That's it. As a higher level spatial magic user, if I wanted to remove it, I could remove it while it is still equipped. I can put it away with a little touch on my body, for example.

<blank>

Miss. Miss Isiah. Don't forget that we have dragons following us?"

Oh, shit, I got that one, too."

...... I completely forgot you were a dragon, Mr. Arthur."

<blank>

Well, it was noticeable that he had a dragon with him.

Rather, the Thunder Dragon deserved all the attention as a vermin that was hindering the distribution of goods in the country. And this guy was the man himself.

<blank>

I'm just a zakolizard, aren't I?　Are you just a lizard?

No, it's a dragon. It's not like that. Yes."

'Di, dia-kun-chan!　Kuun!　Kuhn!

<blank>

Arthur is comforted by Dia-kun.

I thought to myself, "That's already a dog or a cat. I thought, but I didn't tell him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I entrusted Dia, Aisia, and Arthur to report to the Adventurers' Guild and report the accomplishment of the delivery request they were casually doing, as well as to secure a place to stay.

<blank>

So, I came to the church as soon as I could.

<blank>

It was a human-sized church because outsiders would come, but the siesta that greeted me was a loli child the size of a dwarf.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Welcome, my colleagues."

Oh, Siesta is so tiny. So cute."

'Hmmm, because from a Dwarf point of view, this is the best size.'

<blank>

It's called regional color. It's a local siesta.

<blank>

Do siestas in the land of the beasts have chemo ears?"

I'll do it. I have rabbit ears."

<blank>

I'd like to see that for sure. I'd love to go there next time.

<blank>

God is waiting for you.

I was just thinking, "Oops, that's right. There was no church in Isiah's village, though there was a Shinto altar.

<blank>

So I could not deliver the product, and God had to leave it in my hands. The urging was so annoying that I was not happy about it.

<blank>

I sit at the front of the chapel and pray.

God.

<blank>

<blank>

God* descended!　Now, we've been waiting for you, Karina-chan!　Godairoshun jyoshiteru hagushoku haya yakuyaku!"

The five great old spring female shy socks!　I've never heard that word before in my life. ......"

'Just get it out of here, or I, the loli god, will ring the bell and requisition you?　Are you sure?"

<blank>

I don't know what you mean, but it's kind of scary, so I'll just deliver it quickly. I'll deliver it as soon as I can.
