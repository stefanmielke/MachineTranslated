# Capital Akahagane ● With Illustrations

<b>

Capital Akahagane. A town built as if half of a giant mountain had been hollowed out.

It seems that the town began when a meteorite fell on the mountainside, creating a crater that was developed as a mine. Perhaps that's why the air is somewhat dusty and gritty.

<b>

The mountain, resembling a sundial, stands tall and looks like it could collapse at any moment… but apparently, the first king managed to do something about it with magic. Magic is amazing.

<b>

<b>

The town is overall dwarven-sized.

Conversely, shops aimed at other races have larger entrances, but since most shops facing the main street are like that, it looks like an ordinary town to me.

<b>

"That gatekeeper seemed a bit flustered."

"That would probably be because of the gift our lord received from the grandmothers. Anyone who knows would immediately recognize it as a fine item."

"Hmm, if we want to avoid a commotion, maybe we should take it off… but it’s such a precious gift, I don’t want to take it off!"

<b>

The items that the cute little elders (by my standards) made for me by hand.

Even though they are almost useless with spatial magic, it is only proper to wear them at least while I’m in this country! Probably!

<b>

Huh? You think it’ll come back even if I take it off?

That’s a different story. As a user of higher-level spatial magic, I can remove it while keeping it equipped. Like, I could just store it while lightly touching my body.

<b>

"Um, sis. Aisia-san. Don’t forget that you’re accompanied by a dragon, okay?"

"Oh right, that was a thing."

"…I completely forgot, but it was a dragon, wasn’t it, Arthur-kun?"

<b>

Speaking of which, having a dragon with me is quite conspicuous.

In fact, the Thunder Dragon would naturally attract attention as a pest disrupting the country’s distribution. And this one is the very same.

<b>

"Dear-kun, am I kind of inconspicuous?! Am I just a weak lizard?!"

"No, no, it’s a dragon, so that’s not the case. Yes."

"Di, Dear-kun! Woof! Woof!"

<b>

Arthur-kun is being comforted by Dear-kun.

It’s already like a dog or cat. I thought, but I didn’t say it out loud.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I leave the report to the Adventurers' Guild, the subtle delivery request I was doing, and securing a lodging to Dear-kun, Aisia, and Arthur-kun.

<b>

As for me, I headed straight to the church.

<b>

Since outsiders come too, it was a human-sized church, but the one who welcomed me, Siesta, was surprisingly a dwarven-sized loli.

<b>

"Welcome, fellow comrades."

"Oh, Siesta is so small. So cute!"

"Hehehe, for dwarves, this size is the best."

<b>

It’s a matter of regional characteristics. A local Siesta.

<b>

"Does Siesta from the beastman country have animal ears?"

"She does. She has rabbit ears."

<b>

What’s that? I absolutely want to see that. It would be nice to go there next time.

<b>

"More importantly, the deity is waiting, so please offer it quickly."

"Oh right, I forgot. There wasn’t a church in Aisia’s village, but there was a god shelf."

<b>

So I couldn’t make the offering, and the deity was left waiting. The reminders were subtly annoying.

<b>

I sat in the front row of the chapel and offered my prayers.

God…

<b>

<b>

"God☆Descend! Ah, I’ve been waiting for you, Karina-chan! Hurry up with the Five Great Elders’ Spring Revival Female Blushing Socks!"

"Five Great Elders’ Spring Revival Female Blushing Socks?! That’s a word I’ve never heard in my life…"

"Just hurry up and bring them out, or else I, the loli deity, will ring the bell and perform a requiem, okay? Is that alright?"

<b>

I don’t understand what that means, but it sounds terrifying, so I’ll hurry up and make the offering. Yes.
