# "Anger"

For that reason, I have been issued a forced quest by the god.

Well, worst case? I could just escape with spatial magic before the next hero (who is actually the god) starts rampaging here, right?

<b>

Ah, I was just looking for a toy (human) that I could play with freely, so how did it come to this?

<b>

But you know, if I have spatial magic, kidnapping is easy. If I can get 10,000 SP for such an easy quest, it might actually be a good deal.

This SP is probably an abbreviation for execution points, though.

<b>

And then, the god's interference ends and time starts moving again.

<b>

"Uh, um. Blade-senpai, where is that true chaos—what's-it-called...?"

<b>

Even though it has "true" in it, just saying chaos god makes me feel like the god would come barging in with an "Aahn!?" so I ask my senpai somewhat vaguely.

<b>

"Oh, the king should be... in a place called the Prayer Room? Or something like that."

"The Prayer Room?"

"Apparently, it's a place where you offer prayers, though I don't really know the exact location since it's top secret."

<b>

Hmm, what a situation. To evade pursuit from the god, it seems the enemy is hiding.

<b>

"…Senpai, I have to say something quite serious, and you might not believe me, but—this country is on the brink of destruction right now!!"

"Yeah, that's right. That's why we're here to help with the reconstruction."

"No! The new kingdom is currently in danger of being destroyed again by the god!"

<b>

I try to explain the seriousness of the situation to Blade-senpai.

…Wait, thinking about it, I wasn't told to hide my identity or circumstances from the god.

<b>

"Actually, I have connections with the god, and it seems that the chaos god is the name of the god's lover. That old man was using that name without permission, which led to the chaos god being killed and the alchemical kingdom being destroyed."

"Huh? What? Seriously?"

"Yeah. And now the king of the new alchemical kingdom is using the name true chaos god through me, and the god found out. I was told that if we don't capture him alive within three days, this country will be destroyed."

<b>

So, I laid everything out for my senpai. Straightforwardly. Completely honestly.

<b>

"…Seriously?"

"Wow. You believe me? Senpai?"

"Of course! I trust Karina! You're not the type to tell lies like this. So that means it's true, right!? Just to be sure, if you said it was a lie now, I'd still forgive you, right!? I can trust you, right!?"

<b>

Wow, what absolute trust. I was a little taken aback and felt a flutter.

No, as a man. Not in a romantic sense, but as a human, you know? What’s up with you, senpai? You look like a thug but have the heart of a protagonist!

<b>

"…It's true! Please believe me!"

"Got it! I'll get the others to cooperate right away and go talk to the true chaos god. …Uh, I wonder if the god would forgive him if he changes his name?"

『怒』

"No way. The name of the chaos god is the god's taboo. Once you touch it, you can expect destruction."

"Haha, I still don't feel it, but facing a dragon feels easier."

<b>

Well, I know about three dragons, and I've beaten up two of them to make them my underlings.
