That is why God issued me a mandatory quest.

Well, what's the worst that can happen?　If only I could escape with spatial magic before the next brave man (or god, if you prefer) gets out of control here?

<blank>

Oh, how did this happen when all I wanted was a toy (human) that I could free.

<blank>

But you know what? As long as you have spatial magic, abduction is easy. If you can get 10,000 SP for such a simple quest, it must be rather tasty.

I'm sure the SP this time stands for execution point.

and time begins to move after God's interference is over.

<blank>

Oh, um. Braid senpai, where is that true chaos--whatever that is ......?"

<blank>

I felt that even if I put on true, just mentioning the word "chaos god" would cause God to say, "Aaan! I felt that God would get on board, so I blurted it out a little and asked my senpai.

<blank>

"Oh, if he's the king, he's in ...... prayer room right now.　"Yeah, if he's the king, he's probably in a place called  prayer room right now.

Prayer Room?"

I don't know what it was, but they said it was a place to pray. I don't know where. It's top secret or something.

<blank>

Hmmm, what a surprise. It seems that the enemy is hiding to escape pursuit from God.

<blank>

"...... seniors, I'm going to tell you a very bad thing, but believe it or not--this country is dying right now!

"Oh, yeah, that's why we're here. That's why we're here for the recovery."

No," he said, "the newborn is in the pinch of being destroyed by God again!　The newborn is in the pinch right now of being destroyed by God again!"

<blank>

I try to somehow explain the seriousness of this to Braid senior.

I've been thinking about ......, and I realized that God didn't ask me to hide who I am or what's going on.

<blank>

The name "Chaos God" is the name of the god's lover. The god of chaos was killed and the alchemy kingdom was destroyed because an old man took his name without permission.

What about?"　What? What's that? Seriously?"

Yes. So now God has found out through me that the king of the newborn Alchemy Kingdom calls himself the True God of Chaos. And I was told that if I don't capture him alive within three days, this kingdom will be destroyed.

<blank>

And I told all of this to my seniors. Straight up. Straight up.

<blank>

...... for real?"

That one. You believe me?　Senpai."

I trust Carina!　I trust Karina!　You're not the kind of guy who tells lies like this. So you're sure!　I'm going to ask you just to be sure, but I'll forgive you even if you lied to me now!　Can I trust you?

<blank>

Wow, what total trust. I'm a bit unintentionally squeamish.

No, as a man. Not as a romantic element, but as a human being.　What's with you, senpai? You look like a thug, but you're a hero inside!

<blank>

"...... Gutsy!　Trust me!"

I understand!　I'll get the others to help me now and go talk to the true God of Chaos. ...... Uh, well, I wonder if God will forgive me if I change my name?"

The Rage.

No," he said. The name of the god of chaos is the reverse scale of God. Once you touch it, expect to be destroyed."

"Haha, I still don't feel it yet, but it's still easier to deal with dragons.

<blank>

Well, I know about three dragons, two of which I've bumped off and made into prefects.
