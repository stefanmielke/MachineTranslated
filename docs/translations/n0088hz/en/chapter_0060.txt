We have become completely clean after the public bath.

After that, we took one of the beds from the pirate's house for our living space, and the pirate's house became Dear-kun's room. It was just as smelly and dirty as my blanket, so it goes without saying that I spent plenty of time cleaning it.

After washing it with seawater, it became sticky for a moment, but I was able to separate the seawater perfectly with space magic and made it nice and clean.

<b>

With this, I could also produce salt if I apply it. It might sell well... Do you need a license to trade salt? If so, I guess I'll just secure it for personal use.

<b>

<b>

The next day, after a good rest on the bedding that was as good as new.

Since there was a day free until the promised day, I decided to kill time by trying my hand at alchemy and creating magical tools.

<b>

"Hey, what book is that, big sister?"

"This? It's an alchemy textbook."

<b>

I bought it at the magical tool shop where I got the lotion. By the way, it was published by the Alchemy Kingdom. Hmm, it might become a collector's item in the future.

The textbook contained magic circles. Things that move or cause phenomena. It seems that if you engrave them on the target and pour in ink made from melted magic stones, you can create them.

<b>

"I was thinking of making something with alchemy!"

"Something?"

<b>

It's a massager. You just attach a vibrating ball to the end of a stick and create a switch on the stick to complete it.

However, I don't have the ink made from magic stones or the magic stones for power...

<b>

"Ah, it says here how to make magic stone ink. Ink and magic stones. I believe we have ink at the pirate's house, and there should be some magic stones for golems on the ship."

"Oh! Good job, Dear-kun! You're cute and capable!"

<b>

I gently pat his head.

If I know that the items are there, I can use space magic to have them delivered to me. Ah, it was definitely the right choice to rob from the pirates. I got all sorts of things by completely plundering their base.

<b>

...However, the items and money obtained in this way will not be handled by merchant Karina! To keep my identity as a merchant separate from my identity as a great magician, it's a natural restriction.

However, if I process them into magical tools myself, I can treat them as personal transactions!

<b>

"Um? I need to crush the magic stones into powder and mix them into the ink little by little... The ratio should be about a pinky nail's worth of magic stone for one ink pot. Like this."

<b>

After crushing it with space magic, I moved the powder into the ink to make it uniform... Done! The color has turned bluish. It's a success.

<b>

"It seems making magic stone ink takes a whole day... but it's done."

"Hohoho, with me, it's nothing."

<b>

I've already completed this level of space magic operation in the tutorial.

<b>

<b>

Now, let's try the vibration magic circle.

It's quite detailed and a bit tedious. If I make this line longer, the vibration will increase, and if I make this circle bigger, it will speed up. Hmm, hmm. Oh, a note from the shopkeeper. It says that intricate magic circles are difficult to engrave and often fail when pouring in the ink. I see.

<b>

...Then I'll just print it directly onto the wood using the magic stone ink!

Secret technique, space magic inkjet printer! (The magic circle has been fine-tuned in my mind)

And drying! Alright, the magic circle is complete!

<b>

"Just now, when I stroked it with my hand, the magic circle appeared instantly!?"

"Hohoho, with me, it's nothing."

<b>

It's much easier than duplicating an arm and connecting capillaries and nerves.

<b>

Then, all I have to do is embed a magic stone of appropriate size into the power source... It vibrated!

<b>

"Ohhh, it moved! It moved, Dear-kun!"

"I didn't know magical tools could be made so easily."

"Hohoho, well, that's thanks to my magic. Ah, since I haven't made a switch, it will keep moving until I remove the magic stone. Hmm, hmm."

<b>

Um, it seems that using something like magic iron wire, which is similar to copper wire, allows you to create and connect magic circles as parts or turn them into switches. It seems that magic iron wire isn't available at the pirate's house.

Still, this is surprisingly fun, like electronic work.

<b>

"Is this what you wanted to make, big sister Karina?"

"This is the base, and then I just need to shape it and add a switch... Oh, by the way, the one I bought at the magical tool shop has a switch, so I can repurpose that."

<b>

Since I don't plan to sell this prototype, copying it is totally fine! So, while shaping it with space magic, I copied the switch part and magic iron wire from the existing magical tool and embedded them.

The wooden massager is complete!

Not just an electric massager, but a magical massager. If I shorten it, it would be called "Magma"... but that's hard to say, so let's just call it Denma.

<b>

"Completed! I name it Denma!"

"Just now, the wood was rounding and shaving in an amazing way... was that magic too?"

"That's right, isn't it amazing?"

<b>

<b>

"By the way, this is a massager, and it's not an erotic tool at all."

"?"

<b>

Dear-kun tilts his head. It's a very wholesome item, so any unexpected uses are at your own risk.

<b>

"Let's try it out right away... Ahhh, it feels so good on my shoulders!"

"Wow, so that's how you use it?"

"Ahhh, it feels so nice!"

<b>

I definitely feel some shoulder stiffness from the weight of my breasts. I've lifted them with space magic to alleviate it. This is really good!

<b>

"Ahh... I think Denma will sell well. What do you think?"

"From what I've seen, the structure is very simple, so I think it will be easily replicated. Or maybe there are already people making it."

"Ah, well, there are golems and all..."

<b>

Oh, right. I wonder what the golems are like. They are magical tools, right?

Thinking that, I decided to scan the combat golem I obtained from Gomez using space magic...

...Yeah.

<b>

<b>

Well, it's only natural, but if the golem is the latest electric car, then Denma is like connecting a light bulb to a battery!!
