# Another new page in the universal theory of spatial magic.

We are now completely clean in the public bathhouse.

After that, I received one of the beds from the pirate's house for my living space, and incidentally, the pirate's house became Dear's room. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time cleaning it because it was as smelly and dirty as my blanket.

When I washed it with seawater that was just around the corner, it became sticky, but I was able to separate the seawater well with spatial magic and was able to clean it up perfectly.

<blank>

If we apply this, we can make salt. It's going to sell well. ...... I wonder if you need a license to trade salt?　If so, I guess I'll just keep it for myself.

<blank>

<blank>

And the next day after a good night's rest on bedding that was as good as new.

Since my appointment was tomorrow and I had a day free, I decided to try my hand at alchemy and magical tool creation to pass the time.

<blank>

Hey, sister, what kind of book is that?"

'This?　The alchemy manual."

<blank>

I bought it at the same magical tool store where I bought the lotion. By the way, it was issued by Alchemy Kingdom. Hmmm, I guess it will be at a premium in the future.

The instructional book had a magic circle. They said it could be something that moved or caused a phenomenon. They said it could be done by engraving it on the object and pouring ink with melted magic stone.

<blank>

I'm going to use alchemy to make something!"

What do you have?"

<blank>

It is a massage device. A ball that shakes normally is attached to the end of a stick, and a switch is placed on the end of the stick to complete the device.

But there's no ink to melt the magic stone, no magic stone to power it--

<blank>

Oh, it shows how to make magic stone ink. Ink and magic stone. I believe the ink was in the pirate's house, and the magic stone for the golem was on the ship.

Oh!　Nice work, Dear!　You're cute and talented!"

<blank>

I will gently pat him on the head.

If you know the thing is there, you can use spatial magic to get it to you. Wow, it was a good decision to rob the pirates. We got a lot of stuff because we robbed someone's whole base.

<blank>

...... However, the direction is that goods and money obtained in a certain unjustified way in this way will not be handled by the merchant Karina-chan!　It's called a natural binding play to keep me, the merchant, and myself, the great wizard, as separate entities.

However, it should be handled at the private transaction level as long as a cushion is provided for processing it into magical tools by oneself or other means!

<blank>

You say, "Uh huh?　Can we crush and grind the magic stone until it is a powder and mix it with the ink a little at a time? The ...... distribution is about a pinky fingernail of magic stone to one jar of ink. Like this."

<blank>

After crushing with spatial magic, the powder is overwritten and moved so that it is evenly distributed in the ink. ...... is completed!　The color is bluish. Success.

<blank>

I heard it takes a day to make magic stone ink, but you've done it at ......."

"Ho-ho-ho, that's what I get."

<blank>

This level of spatial magic manipulation is already covered in the tutorial.

<blank>

<blank>

So, let's try the magic circle of vibration next.

It is moderately detailed and cumbersome. If I lengthen the line here, the vibration will increase, and if I enlarge the circle over here, it will be faster? Hmmm. Oh, a note from the owner. He said, "If the magic circle is too fine, it is difficult to engrave and often fails to pour ink. I see.

<blank>

With ......, you'd start from the beginning, printing magic stone ink on wood with an overwritten copy!

Secret, spatial magic inkjet printer! (Magic circle has already been fine-tuned in my brain)

In addition, dry!　Okay, the magic circle is complete!

<blank>

'I just stroked it with my hand and a magic circle appeared in an instant, didn't it!'

"Ho-ho-ho, that's what I get."

<blank>

That's a lot easier than duplicating arms and connecting capillaries and nerves.

<blank>

Then, the appropriate sized magic stone can be embedded at the power source and ...... trembled!

<blank>

"Oh, oh, oh, it's moving!　It moved, Mr. Deere!"

I didn't know it was so easy to make magical tools."

I'm not sure if it's my magic or not, but I'm sure it's my magic. Oh, I didn't make this switch, so it will stay in motion until I remove the magic stone. Hmmm..."

<blank>

Let's see, I was also told that using a kind of copper wire called "magic wire", magic circles can be made in parts and connected together, or used as switches. It seems that the magic wire is not available in the pirate's house.

But it's still fun to do something that looks like an electronic construction.

<blank>

Is this what you want to make?

This is the base, and then we'll shape it and put the switches on. ...... Oh, by the way, I have a switch from a guy I bought at a grimoire store, so I'll just use that."

<blank>

This prototype is not going to be sold, so copying it is totally OK! So, while shaping it with spatial magic, the switch part and the magic wire were copied from the existing magic tool with spatial magic and embedded.

The wooden massager is complete!

Not an electric massage device, but a magical massage device. If I abbreviate it, it's hard to say Demma......, so I'll just call it Denma.

<blank>

It's done!　I call it Denma!"

"The wood just curled and shaved in an amazing way. ...... Is that magic, too?"

Yeah, isn't that great?"

<blank>

Another page has been added to the universal theory of spatial magic.

<blank>

By the way, this is a massage device, not a sex toy in the slightest.

?"

<blank>

Deere, you nod your head. It's a very healthy item, and any unexpected use is at your own risk.

<blank>



Heh, that's how you use it."



<blank>

I feel like I have stiff shoulders from the weight of my boobs. I've been using space magic to lift them up and reduce the stiffness. It's good.

<blank>

Fwiw. I think we can sell ......, Denma. What do you think?"

As far as I have seen, the structure is so simple that I think it will be imitated soon. Or maybe someone has already made one."

Ah, well, there's even such a thing as a golem. ......

<blank>

Ah, yes. I wonder what the golem looks like. That's a magical tool too, right?

With that in mind, I'm going to use spatial magic to scan the battle golem I got from Gomez and his team: ......

...... yeah.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, of course, if the Golem was the latest electric car, the Denma was like a miniature light bulb connected to a battery!
