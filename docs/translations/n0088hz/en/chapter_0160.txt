# I got caught. I got caught easily.

"Well, how about three cups to start?"

"It's a disgrace for a dwarf not to serve alcohol to customers, so please, go ahead."

<b>

The dwarf sisters casually brought out alcohol from the kitchen cupboard.

It was an amber-colored drink in a glass bottle.

Poured into a smaller glass, it emitted a sweet apple-like aroma from the evaporated alcohol.

<b>

"Ah, wait! Since you're human, you shouldn't drink that much..."

"Ah, I'll have some. Don't worry, I can drink despite how I look!"

<b>

Aisia tried to stop me, but I'm not an idiot.

I could clearly feel the strong alcohol in the drink. If I took even a sip, I'd be completely drunk!

Before it became common knowledge that Dia-kun is a boy in girl’s clothing and mine, I would probably get wasted and lose my memory.

<b>

So, I’ll go with the drinking act strategy I used in the drinking contest with Gomez!

<b>

I brought the drink to my mouth—and in that instant, I stored it in my dimensional space!

Instead, I swallowed the water I had switched it with!

<b>

Phew!

<b>

"Wow, this is delicious! Thank you for the treat!"

<b>

I returned the empty glass—only to find Aisia’s grandmother and others staring at me with narrowed eyes.

<b>

"…There’s no alcohol mixed in your breath. You didn’t drink properly, did you? You can’t fool our eyes."

"Eh, you got rid of the alcohol!? What kind of trick did you use? I’m curious about the gimmick."

"I can’t believe it, it’s a desecration of alcohol! …You didn’t throw it away, right?"

<b>

I got caught. I got caught easily.

<b>

"Don’t hold back. It’s a special delicious drink."

"Come on, drink up. I’ll figure out your trick!"

"This is my dad's secret fire liquor. If you make it disappear again, I’ll get angry, you know?"

<b>

I’m really gathering attention. Eyes that observe, eyes that won’t tolerate wasting alcohol.

Being family, if I’m stared at with those eyes that look just like Aisia and Sati-chan, I have no choice but to drink without trying to deceive them…!

<b>

Besides, fire liquor is that stuff, the kind that even dwarves can’t help but recognize as alcohol.

<b>

…When I looked at Aisia, she had a look that seemed to say, "I told you to stop."

I understand. I’ll brace myself.

<b>

"I-I’ll have some!"

<b>

I tilted the glass and took a sip. A moment of chill followed by a rich aroma spreading in my mouth.

Oh, it’s delicious. But the next moment, a stabbing heat assaulted my oral mucosa.

<b>

Ugh!? This is intense! The alcohol is so strong!?

My throat… my throat is burning!! Ah, my stomach, it feels hot inside!

<b>

"Phew…"

"Oh! This time you actually drank it. Not bad, guest!"

"That’s more like it for Aisia’s master. Let’s welcome you."

"I want to drink the fire liquor too. Grandma, can I have a bottle…? No? How stingy."

<b>

N-Now, the dwarf women welcomed me with smiles for actually drinking.

…Ah, no. My head is feeling all fuzzy…

<b>

"Ah, Master!"

<b>

Hearing Aisia's voice, I felt my strength leave my body and I slumped down.

And then—

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Haah…! Ah, my head hurts…"

<b>

I woke up. My memory was completely gone. Hmm, it’s been a while since I felt this sensation.

<b>

So, what happened this time… wow. There are a lot of dwarves sleeping in this room. Both men and women are sprawled out together. But around me, there are only lolis.

…Yeah, there are a few without clothes too, both genders.

<b>

"Ah, good morning, Master."

"…Good morning, Aisia. So, what happened after that? I don’t remember anything after putting the alcohol in my mouth."

"Yes! Dia-sama is safe!! He was isolated in the children’s room to rest!!"

<b>

Well, that’s good. But what about me??? 

I’m a bit scared to ask.
