# I was found out. Easily exposed.

"Well, three drinks in a row?"

It's bad form for a Dwarf not to serve alcohol to his guests.

<blank>

And, as if it were a matter of course for the Dwarf sisters, alcohol was served from the kitchen cupboard.

It is an amber-colored liquor in a glass bottle.

Poured into a small glass, it has a sweet, apple-like aroma from the volatile alcohol.

<blank>

Oh, hey," he said, "I'm a human being!　Anji-sama is a human being, so alcohol is not such a ......"

I'll have some. Don't worry, it's not like I can't drink like this!"

<blank>

Isiah stopped me, but I'm not stupid either.

A drink that is overtly strong alcohol. If I took even one sip, I would be waiting to get drunk!

Dear you will be drunk and lose your memory before you make it known that you are a man's daughter and my property.

<blank>

So here I'm going to use the strategy of pretending to drink that I used in the drinking contest with Gomez!

<blank>

I bring the alcohol I received to my mouth - and at that moment it is stored in the storage space!

Instead, he swallows the water that has been replaced!

<blank>

Phew!

<blank>

'Oh no, it's delicious!　Thanks for the treat!"

<blank>

I return the empty glass to her, and Isiah's grandmother and others stare at me.

<blank>

...... There's no alcohol in your exhale. You haven't been drinking properly, have you?　You can't fool our eyes.

What kind of magic trick did you use?　What kind of magic trick did you use? I'm curious about the gimmick.

'I don't believe it, it's a desecration of alcohol! You didn't dump ......, did you?"

<blank>

They found out. They found out easily.

<blank>

He said, "Don't be shy. It's a very good sake."

'Come on, have a drink, have a drink. I'll find out how it works!"

It's my father's secret fire wine. If you turn it off again, I'll be very angry.

<blank>

It's a very, very attention-grabbing experience. Observant eyes, eyes that don't tolerate the poor taste of alcohol.

They are family, and when they look at me with eyes like that, just like Aisia and Satitan, I have no choice but to drink without any more deception. ......

<blank>

I mean, fire wine is something that even dwarves have to judge alcohol.

<blank>

I looked at ...... Isiah and he looked at me as if to say, "That's why I stopped you.

Okay, I'm ready. I'm ready.

<blank>

Yes, I'll take it!"

<blank>

The glass is tilted up and the wine is placed in the mouth. A cool sensation and a mellow aroma spread to the palate.

Oh, it tastes good. The next moment I thought, a stabbing heat attacked the mucous membranes of my mouth.

<blank>

Wooooooo!　Kits!　Alcohol tight!

My throat is ...... burning!　Oh, my stomach and stomach are burning!

<blank>

"Puphahah ......"

You drank it this time," he said!　You drank right this time. You did it, my guest!"

That's why you are the right master for Isiah," he said. Let's welcome her."

I'd like to drink it too. Grandma. Give me a bottle of ...... no?　Stinky."

<blank>

This time, I drank properly, and the Dwarf women welcomed me with smiles.

...... Oh, no. Fluffy head fluffy suryuu......

<blank>

Oh, my God!

<blank>

As I hear Aysia's voice, I slump down and sit up, my strength draining from my body.

And--

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Ha ......!　Oh, my head hurts! ......"

<blank>

I woke up. My memory is gone. Hmmm, it's been a long time since I had this feeling.

<blank>

So what the heck happened this time... ...... Wow. Wow, there are a lot of dwarves sleeping in this room. Both men and women are sleeping together. I was the only loli in the room.

...... Yeah, there's a few unclothed ones here and there, too, both men and women.

<blank>

Ah, good morning, Mister.

You can find me at "...... Good morning, Isiah. Hey, what happened since then?　I don't remember anything since I had a sip of alcohol."

Yes, Master Dia is safe!　Master Dia is safe and sound!　He has been quarantined in the children's room to rest!"

<blank>

Yeah, that's good. So, what's wrong with me?

I'm a little afraid to ask.
