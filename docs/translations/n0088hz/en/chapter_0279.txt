# No way, this is ......

The modified lizardman was not the only one. They suddenly appeared from the wall and attacked us by surprise (we guarded them with spatial magic), appeared from the ceiling and attacked us by surprise (we crushed them against the ceiling with spatial magic), and pinched them from the front and back (we pitched them out of the way with spatial magic).

<blank>

Frankly, without spatial magic, it would be a hard level of power for me and Misha, but not for Braid senior and other adventurers.

When it comes out, the wall suddenly slides out, just like the art of hiding, so it's hard not to be distracted in all directions.

That's a mecha ninja lizardman. If it weren't for spatial magic, he would have been killed.

<blank>

What do you say, Healer? Shall we continue our search?"

"Yes," he said, "and fortunately my magic seems to be able to handle it. Fortunately, my magic seems to be able to handle it."

<blank>

I said that, but I am actually a bit impatient.

In this dungeon, spatial magic can only be used to the extent that it can be seen. No, it is possible to escape from the base and dungeon, but even if you send out a wave of spatial magic to search ahead, you will only get a "wall" response.

What the hell is going on?　This is God's magic!　I could even see through the walls of Carcassa's dungeon.

<blank>

And then it occurs to me. I don't know what's behind the wall.

I don't know what kind of material or mechanism is used, but the walls repel spatial magic.

Even in a healer's outfit, visibility is as poor as when wearing a mask, but not being able to see over the wall is rather painful.

At this rate, they will not be able to cope with the surprise attack, and all but Misha may be slowed down.

<blank>

...... No, I still want everyone but Misha to turn back for a moment."

"Are you sure?　I mean, are we not good enough?"

Ah. It's a tougher dungeon than I thought. I want you to look for other entrances and exits from the outside."

<blank>

When he said this, Blade-senpai nodded his head and said, "Okay," and took the other adventurers with him.

After confirming this, I took off my healer's costume.

<blank>

"Ah, I've lost a servant. Oh, Karina, can you take care of my luggage?

'You should have one yourself, just in case, right?　You never know what's in this dungeon.

<blank>

The next moment I said that, the floor cracked with a snap. Underneath the floor was a laser net with red squares.

<blank>

Nya?　Nyahhh!"

Oops. Are you okay Misha?"

<blank>

He quickly supported Misha with spatial magic, but part of his luggage fell off, turning into dice steaks with a sizzling sound.

<blank>

Aaah!　Atashi no Poshone!"

"You're killing me all of a sudden......... that. Misha, is that tail okay?"

<blank>

When I looked, the tip of his tail was touching the laser.

<blank>

Huh?　Hee!　I'm going to be a catfish! ...... what is that?"

"Not out of order, huh?"

<blank>

Huh, what the heck is this ......

As a test, I took out the mecha ninja lizardman I had caught in the pit earlier and slammed it in.

<blank>

Wow, the raw part is fine, but the mechanical part has been cut off. It was cut into pieces and fell off.

<blank>

"What the hell is this ...... ha!　No way, this is ...... no, is this for real?"

What is it?　Carina, did you notice something?"

A laser that only dismembers clothes!　I think you mean a laser that tears apart only your clothes!"

What the hell is that?

<blank>

Because I can only assume that even portioned bottles are cut, but not raw tails, or something like that. I have no idea what kind of technology is required to achieve this!
