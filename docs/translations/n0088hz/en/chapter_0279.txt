# No way, this is……

<b>

The modified Lizardman is not just one. It suddenly appeared from the wall to launch a surprise attack (I defended with spatial magic), appeared from the ceiling to launch a surprise attack (I pressed it against the ceiling and crushed it with spatial magic), and surrounded us from both front and back (I dealt with it by creating a pitfall with spatial magic).

<b>

Honestly, without spatial magic, I think the strength level would be tough for me, Misha, and even Blade-senpai and the other adventurers.

When it appears, the wall suddenly slides open like a technique of concealment, making it hard to let my guard down in all directions.

It's a mechanical ninja Lizardman. Without spatial magic, we would have been done for.

<b>

"What will you do, healer? Should we continue exploring like this?"

"Yeah. Fortunately, it seems I can handle it with my magic."

<b>

Though I said that, I actually feel a bit anxious.

This dungeon, surprisingly, only allows spatial magic to work within visual range. Well, we can escape to the base or outside the dungeon, but when I try to send out waves of spatial magic to scout ahead, all I get back is a response of 'wall.'

What the heck is going on? This is the god's magic, you know? In the dungeon of Karkassa, I could see through walls properly.

<b>

Then it dawned on me. I can't see beyond the wall.

I don't know what material or mechanism it is, but the wall is repelling spatial magic.

It's already hard enough to see clearly while still in healer attire, like when wearing a mask, and not being able to confirm what's beyond the wall is quite tough.

If this continues, we won't be able to respond to surprise attacks, and anyone other than Misha could become a hindrance.

<b>

"……No, I think it's best if everyone except Misha retreats for now."

"Is that alright? I mean, are we really that underpowered?"

"Yeah. This dungeon is tougher than I expected. Please check outside for any other exits."

<b>

Saying that, Blade-senpai nodded and took the other adventurers with him.

Once I confirmed that, I took off my healer outfit.

<b>

"Haah, I've lost some minions. Oh, Karina, can you hold my stuff?"

"Just in case, you should carry some yourself, right? We don't know what might happen in this dungeon――"

<b>

Then, the next moment, the floor suddenly cracked open. Below the floor was a red grid laser net.

<b>

"Nyah? Nyaaaーーーー!?"

"Whoa. Are you okay, Misha?"

<b>

I quickly supported Misha with spatial magic, but part of the luggage fell with a sizzling sound, turning into a steak.

<b>

"Ah! My pooootion!"

"Suddenly raised the killing intent there… Wait. Misha, is that tail of yours okay?"

<b>

Looking, the tip of her tail was touching the laser.

<b>

"Huh? Eek!? I'm going to become a Nekomata!!… Huh?"

"It's not cut, is it?"

<b>

Now, what on earth is this……

I tried taking out the mechanical ninja Lizardman I caught in the pitfall earlier and hit it against the laser.

<b>

Wow, the organic parts are fine, but the mechanical parts got cut off. They fell apart and dropped down.

<b>

"What is this… Huh!? No way, could this be… No, is this really what it is?"

"What is it? Did Karina notice something?"

"A laser that only disassembles clothes!! It means it's a laser that only disassembles clothes, right!?"

"What the heck is that!?"

<b>

I mean, it even cuts potion bottles but doesn't disassemble organic tails; that's the only conclusion I can come to. I have no idea what kind of technology would make that possible!
