(A-Rank Adventurer Mashiro's Perspective)

<b>

<b>

"Huh? There's an idiot who had treant wood!?"

"Yeah, that's right, Mashiro. Apparently, they said they took advantage of a large-scale logging site."

"That wasn't part of the plan, what the hell is going on?"

<b>

I heard this information from the gatekeeper at the door to the boss room leading down to the lower levels.

<b>

The lower levels of the Karkassa Dungeon are a forest area.

In this forest, while there are many treants mixed in with ordinary trees, the treants only try to hide and confuse those who pass through; they don't attack.

However, if one tries to hunt those treants, the black demon—the Black Mantis—will appear.

<b>

The Black Mantis is a berserker-type monster. It attacks indiscriminately anyone it sees, whether adventurer or monster, killing them all. The only exception is the treants that camouflage themselves as trees.

Once the Black Mantis appears, it rampages for a week. The lower levels will be sealed off until a week later, when a corpse is confirmed to have fallen as if its lifespan had run out.

<b>

Conversely, once a year, they intentionally lure the Black Mantis by conducting large-scale logging to wipe out the monsters in the forest area...

<b>

"It's not that time of year yet, right? Isn't this just a bluff?"

"That's true, but there's no doubt they had freshly cut treant wood."

"So it means it's not strange for the Black Mantis to appear at any time."

<b>

In this case, we’ll wait for three days, and if the Black Mantis is confirmed, the area will be sealed off for a week.

Seriously, what a stupid thing to do.

Do they not know why the gatekeeper is stationed in front of this boss room leading to the lower levels, and why they are always warned not to hunt treants?

Those idiots will probably face demotion. They might even be charged for the damages.

<b>

"I'm sorry, but could you hurry and call out? There are four parties inside. One of them is checking the logging site. I can't offer much in terms of reward, but it's an emergency request for Silver."

"This is troublesome; I was planning on doing some light spider hunting today."

"Silver's nose is reliable. Please."

"Fine, when I get back, you owe me a drink."

<b>

It feels bad to abandon adventurers from the same town. I decided to take this request.

<b>

<b>

I found the second party and called out to them, and for the third party. Unfortunately, the Black Mantis was about to attack those unlucky guys in the third party.

<b>

"That was close!"

<b>

I intervened in a swing of that black scythe. If it weren't for my dwarven-made sword, I would have been cut down!

<b>

While deflecting, I aimed for its eyes with my darts. However, the red compound eyes accurately tracked the trajectory and dodged with minimal movement. Damn, that mantis bastard.

<b>

"Yikes!? Ah, Silver..."

"Hurry and run! Tell the gatekeeper that a demon has appeared and seal the area!"

"S-Sorry!"

<b>

From what I could see, they were C-rank adventurers. They wouldn't even be able to resist the Black Mantis.

If I left them alone, they would be easily killed, and then I would be next. It would be the same if I intervened to buy time. Rather, the number of survivors would increase, and the gatekeeper would be informed of the demon's appearance.

<b>

All that's left is to somehow survive... but that's the most troublesome part.

If I could lure it into a spider's nest, I could leave it to the spiders and be done with it, I hope!

<b>

<b>

—In the midst of this desperate battle, I thought that was a bad idea, and I heard a nasty crack.

My sword is in trouble. If this continues, it will break! I quickly rolled to avoid having my sword snapped. However, as a result, I found myself cornered.

<b>

"Damn it, not here...!"

<b>

And then, at that moment.

<b>

"Hey, do you need help?"

"Huh!?"

<b>

A relaxed female voice that was out of place in the situation rang out.
