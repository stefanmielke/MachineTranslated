# What's up? (From the viewpoint of A-rank adventurer Masilo)

(From the viewpoint of A-rank adventurer Masilo)

'What?　Some idiot had Trent's wood!"

I'm not sure if that's true or not, Masilo. He said something about taking advantage of a large logging site that was there.

You weren't planning on it. What the hell?

<blank>

The door to the boss's room that leads down to the lower level. The doorkeeper there approached me and gave me this information.

<blank>

The lower level of the Carcassa dungeon, which is a forested area.

Although this forest has many torrents mixed in with the normal trees, the torrents only try to hide the path they have taken and lead you astray, but they do not attack you.

However, if you try to hunt the torrent, the black devil - Black Mantis - will appear.

<blank>

Black Mantis is a berserker-type monster. It attacks and kills all adventurers and demons it sees, without distinction. The only exception is Trent, who mimics a tree.

And once the Black Mantis appears, it will rampage for a week. After exactly one week, the lower level would be sealed off until a body was found collapsed as if its life had run out.

<blank>

On the other hand, once a year, we do a large-scale logging operation and intentionally lure Black Mantis to wipe out the demons in the forest area. ......

<blank>

It's not that time of year yet, is it?　I thought you were a fluker."

I'm sure they did, but I'm pretty sure they had some freshly cut torrent timber."

So you're saying that Black Mantis could come out at any moment."

<blank>

If this happens, we'll wait and see for three days, and if Black Mantis is confirmed, then we'll go into lockdown for a week.

Utterly ridiculous.

Don't you know why a door guard is placed in front of the door of this boss room that leads to the lower level, and why he is called out "Don't hunt torrents" every time.

Perhaps the idiots will be demoted. They may be charged for damages.

<blank>

I'm sorry, but could you please hurry up and call out to them. There are four parties in the back now. One of them is the guy who is having the logging site checked. I can't offer much in the way of reward, but I'm going to make an urgent request to White Silver for an appointment.

I was supposed to be doing some light spider hunting today.

I'm counting on my silvery white nose. Please."

"Oh well, buy me a drink when I get back."

<blank>

Abandoning an adventurer from the same town was not a good aftertaste. I decided to accept this request.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

I sought out two groups and called out to them, and then a third group. Unfortunately, Black Mantis was about to attack the third group of guys.

<blank>

Watch out!

<blank>

With one swing of his black scythe, Atashi interrupted. If it wasn't for the Dwarven sword, I would have been cut down!

<blank>

While passing it off, he aims at the eye with a dart. But the red compound eye catches its trajectory accurately and avoids it with minimal movement. Damn you, you praying mantis.

<blank>

Hiii!　Oh, white silver ......!"

"Get the hell out of here, tell the doorkeeper the devil is out and seal the door!"

I'm sorry!

<blank>

From the looks of it, they are C-rank adventurers. These guys can't even resist Black Mantis.

If left unattended, they would be killed by the assailant and the next one would be the ataman, and the same thing would happen if the ataman intervened to buy time. Rather, the number of survivors will increase, and the appearance of the devil will also be communicated to the doorkeeper.

<blank>

The rest of us just have to survive somehow ......, and that's the most trouble.

If we can lure them into a spider colony, we can get rid of them by putting them on the spiders!

<blank>

<blank>

--I heard a crackling sound, as if I shouldn't have thought of that in the midst of a last-minute battle.

The sword is in trouble. If I don't do something, it will break!　He quickly rolls over to avoid having his sword broken. But he is forced to pay the price.

<blank>

Damn, here's ......!"

<blank>

And that was when it happened.

<blank>

Hey, you need help?"

What?

<blank>

A laid-back female voice, not unlike that of the place, was heard.
