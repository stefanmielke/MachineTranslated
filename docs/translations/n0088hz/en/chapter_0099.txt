# From today on, I too am an alchemist (potions)

<blank>

I'm Karina!

I bought a book on alchemy, potions edition, from Sati-tan, so from today I am an alchemist (potions edition)!

<blank>

So I immediately read the instruction book and found it moderately interesting. No, I bought it because I was interested in it in the first place.

It seems that mana potion restores magic power by ingesting mana contained in medicinal herbs and materials.

<blank>

That means I can make mana potions from demons, right?"

<blank>

Rather, it seems that demons are excellent materials as materials containing magical power. Hohoho.

Since they do not recover much if eaten as is as food, it is necessary to process them well. Alchemy (potion) techniques are used to accomplish this.

<blank>

<blank>

I immediately went to the mountains near Solacidore to collect medicinal herbs. It was easy to understand because it was illustrated in the instruction book. Now, how should I cook this guy? ...... It is on the next page of the instruction book.

<blank>

<blank>

Hey, sister. What are you doing?"

Oh, Dear. Alchemy. Alchemy. Potions edition."

I'm not going to let you do that!　Oh, please call out to me, too!　Is that a new book? Let me see it!

<blank>

You're so curious about new things, aren't you, Dear?　Sure, sure!

<blank>

I was actually thinking of learning it first and giving Deere a seniority complex.

Then why didn't you do it in your room instead of the living room?"

In my room, I'm, you know, distracted.

<blank>

I see the toys, and I end up doing something else. Hehe.

<blank>

Then maybe it would be a good idea to build a workroom."

I'm like, "Oh, that's good. Let's make it next time. I'll try to do some woodworking in the workroom, too, and we'll make progress."

It's tempting to buy all sorts of work tools."

I'm thinking of building a blacksmithing room again with blacksmithing tools and so on.　I like it, my dreams are expanding.

<blank>

You can create as many rooms as you want, and you can create a room for each purpose in detail.

Oh, well, you know, a room packed with toys for that thing. ...... No, I'll have to keep that in my room. I mean, if Dear or Isiah sees it, I'll die. Dignity.

<blank>

Sister, I think I need a medicine chest or mortar to grind the herbs.

I can use spatial magic, but I'm going to make a tool out of stone. Wouldn't you like to do that, Deer?"

Yes, I'd like to try."

<blank>

Therefore, he created tools from natural stone, such as a mortar and pestle, and a pestle and pestle with spatial magic.

You can eventually buy a proper tool, but this should be enough for a trial.

<blank>

"...... this tool might be of better quality than a poorly made one?"

'Oh, really?　It's kind of a make-it-in-time kind of thing, in my opinion."

Your sister's spatial magic is very precise," he said. And since it is carved out of natural stone, I think it is an expensive tool.

<blank>

Oh, I'm confident that our machining accuracy is second only to God's in the world. Yes, I'm sure.

<blank>

For now, follow the instruction manual and grind the herb and squeeze out the juice. Now I need to boil this guy in a pot with magic ...... potion pot, which seems to be a magical tool that incorporates a special magic circle. You should have written it down first. It's not a good setup.

The magic circle was written on it, though, and it was easy to make. I copied the one-handed pot from the pirate's hideout and printed the magic circle. Ei-ei-ei-ei. Finished.

<blank>

This magic circle has all sorts of complex features built in!"

Really?"

Yes, it seems to have the effect of separating, extracting, and preserving components." Which is which: ......"

<blank>

Dia, who did not seem to have much fun in the process of grinding medicinal herbs, was very excited to see the magic circle. The herbs are put in a pot with water and boiled.

Carefully remove the scum, and keep the scum as it is said to become another material with the scum. I won't use it this time.

<blank>

...... Hmm, all that grating and stewing, it's pretty tedious."

Deere, you don't like this kind of work very much, do you?"

It's very different from figuring out the circuits and combinations of magical tools. No, essentially, making magical tools requires this kind of down-to-earth work. ...... Thanks to your sister, I realize I was only doing the fun part."

<blank>

Oh, I had done all that with my space magic, didn't I? Like making ink.

The fact that I never fail because I carve magic circles or pour ink into a wooden board or something is certainly a factor in Dia's growing magical tool fever and talent, I'm sure.

<blank>

In terms of the number of times he has been able to move the magic circle he designed as a magical tool, Dia probably has more experience than a novice magic tool craftsman. On the other hand, he has not developed the necessary skills of ink making and engraving at all. He is becoming a very rare person in this world who specializes in designing magic tools.

Specialized, I don't hate it.

<blank>

Anyway, strain the stewed herbs and the potion base is ready. It is a beautiful bluish green color.

It is said that if ingredients containing magic power are added to the potion base and simmered in a potion pot and strained, they can be made into a variety of potions.

<blank>

If you boil the magic stone, it will surely become a mana potion. It seems like there are a lot of possibilities for research, such as blending.

'Wouldn't it be possible to make certain potions more efficiently if we worked on the magic circle?'

I'll leave the research to you, Dia. I'll make a mana potion and drink it for now.

<blank>

I put some roughly crushed goblin and orc magic stones to test it out and let it simmer.

......

The color has turned much bluer. Is this how it should be?　Let's take a sip to try it out.

Take a scoop with a wooden spoon and bring it to your mouth.

<blank>

"Nn...... bitter. Also, it doesn't recover magic at all. ......"

I'd like to have a sip of it. ...... Oh, one sip restores a lot of magic."

<blank>

Hmmm?　Do you have a different reaction to me and Deere?　What do you mean?

<blank>

But even if you drink a bottle of this, you won't recover enough for one transfer of spatial magic.　If you make a copy of it, you'll lose money.

...... isn't that just a lot of magic consumed by spatial magic?"

Huh?

<blank>

[Sad news] Wow, my amount of magic power, too much! [Naturally.

I'm a God-fearing man who knows how to use cheat magic. It was natural that the vessel was too big!

<blank>

I wanted a percentage recovery. ......!"

You mean you're not going to replenish your magic from the potion. That would probably be a potion that would be hard on the body."

<blank>

Oooh, that's true too. It would be the kind of medicine that you feel like borrowing in advance from your future self in times of need. It would be, at best, like a nutritional drink, which would normally be toxic to the body if taken on a regular basis.

<blank>

<blank>

The finished potion is divided into smaller portions and put away with spatial magic. I hadn't bought any bottles for potions. I'll buy some next time.

<blank>

But, sister, doesn't that mean that you can use any amount of ordinary magic?　Like the magic skills in the catalog.

Oh. A magic scroll for that. I see. ......"

<blank>

<blank>

...... Yes, that's right. On the other hand, if I used my body as a material, I wonder how much magic power restoring potion I could make. The idea came to me, and I copied a piece of my own breast meat, cut it into small pieces, and put it into the potion base.

Oh, the color changes at a great rate.

<blank>

I'm like, "...... sister, what is the material you just put in?　It's blue all at once, then purple through blue, and then red."

"Yes, my flesh."

Don't hesitate to use yourself as material!"

<blank>

It's a copy, so why not? Right?

<blank>

'And then it's a red potion. ...... Dear, this is a mana potion, isn't it?　And it turned blue at first."

"Yeah, come on, ......?　At least, that's what the textbooks say, that mana potions are blue."

It's just an introductory book for beginners. I'm sure there are red mana potions in the advanced books. Yes, I'm sure.

<blank>

When it has turned bright red, it is divided into small portions by spatial magic as a completion.

I'll get a glass jar for the potion next time, it looks good.

<blank>

Just smelling it seems to restore me to the point of overflowing with magic power."

I think even I can recover a little if I drink all of this. It's not enough for one copy, but it's enough for several copies of other spatial magic.

<blank>

It's not efficient, but it will be somewhat better if you drink it when you've used too much magic and you're feeling a bit cranky.

It might be just the thing to save for when you have a little extra magic power, Carina-chan potion.
