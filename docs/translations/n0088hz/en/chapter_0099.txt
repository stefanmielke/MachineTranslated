# From Today, I Am an Alchemist (Potion Edition)

<b>

I am Karina-chan!

I bought the alchemy book, Potion Edition, from Sati-tan, so from today, I am also an alchemist (Potion Edition)!

<b>

So, I immediately started reading the textbook, and it was quite interesting. Well, I bought it because I was already interested.

Apparently, the mana potion recovers magical power by ingesting the mana contained in herbs and materials.

<b>

"So that means, we can make mana potions from monsters too, right?"

<b>

It seems that monsters are excellent materials containing magical power. Oh ho.

Since they don't recover much even when eaten as food, it is necessary to process them well. Achieving that is the technique of alchemy (Potion Edition).

<b>

<b>

I quickly went to the mountains near Sorashidore to gather herbs. It was easy to understand because it was illustrated in the textbook. Hehe, now, how should I process this... that's on the next page of the textbook.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, big sister. What are you doing?"

"Oh, Dia-kun. I'm doing alchemy. Alchemy. Potion Edition."

"！ Come on, you should have called me too! Is that a new textbook? Let me see it!"

<b>

Geez, Dia-kun is so curious about new things! Sure thing!

<b>

"Actually, I was thinking of mastering it ahead of you and showing off as a senior."

"Then you should have done it in your own room instead of the living room."

"In my own room, um, I get distracted."

<b>

Toys catch my eye, and I end up doing other things. Hehe.

<b>

"Then maybe it would be a good idea to create a workspace."

"Ah, that sounds good. Let's make one next time. If I do woodworking in a workspace, it should go smoothly."

"I'll want to gather various tools."

"Should we create a blacksmith room for blacksmithing tools? That sounds nice, my dreams are expanding."

<b>

After all, I can create as many rooms as I want, and I can make rooms for specific purposes.

Oh, then, for that, a room filled with toys... no, I have to keep that in my room. If Dia-kun or Aisia see it, I would die. My dignity.

<b>

"Big sister, it seems we need a mortar and pestle to grind the herbs."

"I can substitute with spatial magic, but how about we carve tools out of stone here? You want to try, right, Dia-kun?"

"Yes, I want to try."

<b>

So, using spatial magic, I created a mortar, pestle, and grinding stone from natural stone.

I could buy proper tools later, but this should be enough for a trial.

<b>

"…These tools might be of better quality than buying them carelessly, right?"

"Oh, really? I thought they felt like makeshift tools."

"Your spatial magic has incredible precision. Plus, since they are carved from natural stone, they might actually correspond to expensive tools."

<b>

Ah, indeed, I am confident in the processing precision, second only to the gods in this world. Yes.

<b>

For now, I will grind the herbs and squeeze out the juice according to the textbook. Then, I need to boil this in a pot while applying magic... It seems I need a special magic tool called a potion pot with a magic circle incorporated. They should have written that first. The arrangements are poor.

The magic circle was written down, and I can make it right away, so that's fine. I copied a one-handed pot from a pirate hideout and printed the magic circle. Alright, done.

<b>

"This magic circle has various complex functions incorporated into it!"

"Is that so?"

"Yes, it seems to have effects like separation, extraction, and preservation of components. I wonder which is which..."

<b>

Dia-kun, who didn't seem to enjoy the grinding task, was now excited about the magic circle. He added the herbs to the pot with water and boiled them.

He carefully removed the scum, which apparently becomes another material, and set it aside. I won't use it this time.

<b>

"…Phew, grinding and boiling is quite a hassle."

"Don't you like this kind of work, Dia-kun?"

"It's completely different from thinking about the circuits and combinations of magic tools. Well, originally, creating magic tools also requires this kind of tedious work... I'm realizing that thanks to you, big sister, I've only been doing the fun parts."

<b>

Ah, I had been breezing through that with my spatial magic. Like making ink.

Not failing when carving magic circles into wooden boards or pouring ink is definitely a factor in Dia-kun's growing passion and talent for magic tools.

<b>

If we count the number of times Dia-kun has operated the magic circles he designed, he might have done it more than a budding magic tool craftsman. Conversely, he has not developed the necessary skills for making ink or carving at all. He is becoming an extremely rare existence in this world, specializing in magic circle design.

I don't dislike specialization.

<b>

Anyway, once I strain the boiled herbs, the potion base is complete. It has a bluish-green color and is very beautiful.

By adding materials containing magical power to the potion base and boiling it in the potion pot, it seems various potions can be created.

<b>

"If we boil magic stones, it seems we can definitely make mana potions. Blending and researching seems promising."

"If we get creative with the magic circle, we might be able to efficiently create specific potions, right?"

"Yeah, I'll leave that research to you, Dia-kun. For now, I think I'll make a mana potion and try drinking it."

<b>

I decided to try adding crushed goblin and orc magic stones and boiling them.

……

The color has turned quite blue. Is this good enough? I'll try taking a sip.

I scoop a spoonful with a wooden spoon and bring it to my mouth.

<b>

"Mmm... it's bitter. And it doesn't recover magical power at all..."

"Can I have a sip too? …Wow, it recovers quite a bit of magical power with just one sip."

<b>

Hmm? Is there a difference in reaction between me and Dia-kun? What does that mean?

<b>

"But even if I drink a whole bottle, it won't recover even one use of spatial magic, right? If I copied something, it would definitely be a loss."

"…Isn't that just because the consumption of spatial magic is high?"

"What!?"

<b>

【Sad News】Wow, my magical power is too much!?【Of Course】

I am Karina, created by the gods, mastering cheat magic. It was only natural for my capacity to be enormous!

<b>

"I wanted it to recover in proportion...!"

"That means you don't recover magical power from the potion, right? If that's the case, it would probably become a medicine that burdens the body."

<b>

Oh, that's true. It would be like borrowing from my future self in case of emergency. That might be fine, but if consumed regularly, it could become toxic to the body, just like a nutritional drink.

<b>

<b>

I used spatial magic to divide the completed potion into smaller portions. I hadn't bought any bottles for potions. I'll have to buy some next time.

<b>

"But big sister, if that's the case, then conversely, doesn't it mean you can use normal magic as much as you want? Like the magic skills in the catalog?"

"Oh. That's what the magic scrolls are for. I see..."

<b>

<b>

…Right. Conversely, if I used my body as a material, how much mana recovery potion could I create? Upon this thought, I decided to copy a part of my breast meat, cut it into small pieces, and throw it into the potion base.

Oh, the color is changing rapidly.

<b>

"…Big sister, what was that material you just added? It's turning blue, then purple, and now red!"

"Uh, my meat."

"Don't use yourself as a material without hesitation!"

<b>

It's fine because it's a copy, right? Right?

<b>

"That said, a red potion... Dia-kun, this is a mana potion, right? It started off blue."

"Uh, I don't know... At least, the textbook says mana potions are blue."

"That's just a beginner's introductory book. I'm sure there are red mana potions in advanced books. Yes, definitely."

<b>

Once it turned bright red, I considered it complete and used spatial magic to divide it.

I should buy glass bottles for potions next time; they would look nice.

<b>

"It seems like just smelling it would recover a lot of magical power."

"Well, if I drink all of this, I might recover a bit. It won't be enough for one copy, but for other spatial magic, it might be enough for a few uses."

<b>

The efficiency is poor, but if I drink it when I feel dizzy from using too much magical power, it should help a bit.

It might be just right to save for when I have excess magical power, the Karina-chan potion.
