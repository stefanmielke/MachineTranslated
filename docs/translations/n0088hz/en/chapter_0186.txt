# Kami-samaーーー！！

<b>

「Kami-samaーーー！！」

「Oh, Karina-chan has arrived.」

<b>

Crowding through the masses, I ran to the church, offered a prayer, and charged into the divine realm, where I found the deity munching on the 'Castle Breaking Hammer.'

<b>

Are you really going to collect divine artifacts like you're eating a giant cotton candy?

<b>

"What are you doing all of a sudden?! I was surprised!"

"Ahaha, if it was all set up like that, I couldn't just not show up. After all, I'm a god, right?"

"Well, you are a god! But if it turns out that since I didn't deliver it directly, the points are invalid, I might complain a bit!?"

"Don't worry, I'll give you a proper 1000 SP."

<b>

The deity finished eating the 'Castle Breaking Hammer' and licked her fingers.

<b>

"Then that's fine."

"Yes, I'll pay you about 1000 SP. ...Hehehe, if this rumor spreads to various countries, they might return unnecessary divine artifacts on their own, thinking they are receiving divine miracles and blessings!"

<b>

The deity grinned. What, really...?

<b>

"Wait a minute. Does that mean..."

"Yes. Thanks to you, Karina-chan, divine artifacts will be offered to me without you having to work for them. Well, that means you won't earn points for that, though."

<b>

And what remains are divine artifacts that are in use and cannot be relinquished.

...Then I won't be able to collect divine artifacts anymore!!

<b>

"Why not just collect the divine artifacts that are being used for bad things?"

"Well, that's true, but..."

"Divine artifacts that aren't being used aren't consuming energy, so they don't really affect the world's balance. It's just like standby power."

<b>

...Are you telling me to collect divine artifacts that are actively being used? I see.

From now on, it will be even more challenging to discern that.

<b>

"You can decide the good or bad uses of the artifacts, Karina-chan."

"Is that really okay?"

"From a god's perspective, it doesn't matter what you do with the tools I gave you. Well, it's a bit concerning that if people die, the candidates for delicious socks decrease, but that's about it."

<b>

What a godly perspective. Who do you think you are? Oh right, you're a god.

<b>

"The socks that couldn't be obtained were just destined to be that way. Not a fate god, though. ...Oh, but please don't touch the divine artifact for sock production."

"Understood."

<b>

If I touch that, it would be war with the deity. Of course, I would lose in an instant.

<b>

"Isn't there a divine artifact that produces energy, like a bicycle generator?"

"Oh, that's an interesting idea. A self-generating machine... with a bicycle... using your legs! Yes, let's create a confession bicycle and set it up in the church so that it also delivers socks!"

<b>

So, if you pedal this bicycle generator, your sins will be forgiven, huh?

That sounds like it would make the church quite lively.

<b>

"Let's make one right away and place it in the Tesshin church for a trial. Karina-chan, please explain it nicely to Siesta."

"I'm troubled if you just throw that at me like this???"

"It's the law of the initiator. I'm counting on you."

<b>

The deity smiled brightly. Tch, I have no choice.

<b>

"Now, setting that aside. Since the SP has increased again, let's use it. Yes, let's do that."

"I'll think carefully about how to use it after the festival."

"Hmm. Well, from a god's perspective, sweets are recommended. They disappear, after all. How about a tapestry that has no meaning? Let's waste some! Luxury is wonderful!"

<b>

Please at least make it a useful item, deity.

In reality, the massage Lv. 5 that I was pushed into is quite useful. Probably the tamer too.

<b>

"Then here, we have a full-body tapestry of Harumikazuchi-chan that you can actually touch. You can touch Harumikazuchi-chan anytime. Of course, she won't find out, touch away. It comes with a special pole for the great price of 250 SP!"

<b>

The deity presented a tapestry of Harumikazuchi in a pose like a body pillow cover illustration. How beneficial for me. It even smells faintly of her incense.

<b>

"…Honestly, I'm captivated."

"If you miss this opportunity, the next ones will be offered at 1000 SP each, you know?"

<b>

Ugh, what a situation. It's 75% off for a limited time!?

That deity is precisely targeting my wallet...!

<b>

"Oh, there's also a tapestry of Dia-kun. It perfectly recreates the feel in the groin area! The sinful scent of a boy! Hoo!"

"Wait, Dia-kun's tapestry is a bit much, isn't it!? Also, Dia-kun wouldn't pose like this in such light clothing!?"

"If you get this now, it's only an additional 500 SP!!"

<b>

To conclude, even with the addition of the tapestry of Sati-tan and Kumin-san, I succumbed.

B-but they said they would give me a set of four for 750 SP...!!

It's a Gamers limited edition, and if you miss it, you won't be able to get it anymore...)
