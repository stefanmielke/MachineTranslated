# God ahhhh!

<blank>

Godhhhh!"

"Oh, here you are, Karina."

<blank>

I ran through the crowd to the church, offered a prayer, and made a suicide attack on the divine world, where I found God munching on a "Breaking Wall Hammer.

<blank>

Are you going to collect the sacred objects like you would eat such a giant cotton candy?

<blank>

What are you doing to me all of a sudden?　You scared me!"

I was so excited to see the way they were setting up the event. I'm God, you know."

I'm not a god!　If you're going to say that my points are invalid because I didn't deliver directly to you, I'm going to complain a little bit!

Don't worry, I'll give you 1,000 SP.

<blank>

and God licking his fingers after eating all the "Breaking Wall Hammer".

<blank>

I don't mind.

'Yes, I'll pay you about 1000 sp. ...... Huffing and puffing, if this rumor spreads to the nations, we will also return the unwanted sacred artifacts on our own, with God's miracles and blessings!"

<blank>

God grinned. What, you say ......?

<blank>

Wait a minute. That means."

Yes. Thanks to Kalina-chan, it means that the sacred artifact can be dedicated to me without Kalina-chan having to work for it. Well, Karina-chan doesn't get any points for that.

<blank>

And all that remains is that they are all divine instruments that are in use and cannot be let go.

...... Then I won't be able to collect my sacred artifacts!

<blank>

Why don't you just collect the sacred artifacts you're using for bad things?"

That's, well, that's just the way it is.

The goddesses we don't use in the first place don't use energy either, so they don't affect the world's balance of payments that much. It's just standby power."

<blank>

Are you asking me to retrieve the ...... acclaimed Divine Instrument that you are using? I see.

It's going to be more difficult to discern that in the future.

<blank>

You can decide what is good or bad for you.

Eh, are you sure?"

God doesn't care what you do with the tools I gave you," he said. Well, it's a little bit bad if someone dies and the number of good sock candidates decreases, but that's about it.

<blank>

What a divine perspective. Who the hell are you?　It was God.

<blank>

I'm the god who separates the socks I didn't get from the fate of the socks I didn't get. I'm not a god of fate. ...... Oh, but just don't touch the god of sock production."

Ah-hai."

<blank>

If I mess with that, I'm at war with God. Of course, I'm the one who loses in an instant.

<blank>

I mean, is there some kind of divine device that produces energy?　Like a bicycle generator.

Hou. That's an interesting idea. I'll use my ...... feet on a self-generating ...... bicycle!　And while we're at it, let's make a penance bike or something to make sock deliveries and set it up at the church!"

<blank>

The more you pedal this bicycle generator, the more your sins will be forgiven.

That would also make the church hilarious.

<blank>

I will make one and put it in the church in Tessin as a trial. Carina, please explain it to Siesta in a nice way."

I don't want you to throw that in my face.

It's the law of the initiator. I asked for it."

<blank>

God smiling. Tsk, I can't help it.

<blank>

Well, that's it, I've got more SP now, so let's use it.

I will think long and hard about using it after the festival."

'Hmmm. Well, God-willing, I recommend sweets. They are vanishing things. And how about a meaningless tapestry?　Let's waste it. Luxury is wonderful!

<blank>

At least make it a useful item, God willing.

In fact, the massage lvl 5 sold to me is very useful. Maybe even tamers.

<blank>

Then here it is, a life-size full-body tapestry of Harumikazuchi-chan that gives you the feeling of actually touching the real thing. You can touch Harumikazuchi-chan anytime. Of course, she won't know that you are touching her, and you can touch her all you want. It also comes with a special pole for a special price of 250 SP!

<blank>

And God brought out a tapestry showing Sister Harumikazuchi posed as if she were an illustration for a hug pillow cover. What a good thing for me. I can even smell her incense.

<blank>

I'm honestly fascinated by ......."

If you miss out now, we'll be offering 1,000 SP a piece from now on, won't we?

<blank>

Ugggh, what a deal. Now only 75% off!

God, he's been shooting at my wallet with precision. ......

<blank>

Oops, we also have a tapestry of Dear-kun. The touch between the legs is also perfectly reproduced!　The immoral scent of a man's daughter!　Hyuh!"

The first thing to do is to take a look at the picture.　And Dia-kun doesn't pose like this in such light clothing!

Now add this and the price is only 500 SP!"

<blank>

In conclusion, I succumbed when the tapestry of Sati-tan and Ms. Kumin was added.

Because they're willing to give me 750 SP for a set of 4. ......!
