# It was just a business meeting, okay?

<blank>

I'm Karina.

I had a long business meeting with Sister Harumikazuchi, and I realized it was nighttime.

<blank>

I was a little overzealous ......, but I got to enjoy my sister's beautiful and lovely figure, so that's good!"

<blank>

Well, well, it was just a business meeting, you know?　Really, really. I was just doing a physical sales demonstration in a private room upstairs. Your sister's lips were soft. I don't remember the last time I was there, so it was my first time. I don't remember the last time, so it was actually my first time.

<blank>

Oh, the one I sold was made with materials I had consumed. The materials were stolen from pirates, but they were prototypes and still in the category of private transactions, so they were safe.

<blank>

<blank>

By the way, my sister also told me, "This will be copied soon, it's so simple. She also gave me advice from a merchant's point of view, saying, "It would be good to make a lot of products first and sell them off. She is so kind. I like her!

...... Well, if they copy me, that's fine. If that starts a free competition for massage devices, maybe they will come up with a better massage device than I can make.

<blank>

Let's just divide the making of massage equipment, or rather magical tools, as a hobby.

In the first place, the merchant's job is to buy and sell, and it is the craftsman's job to make. Karina Shonin is a merchant.

<blank>

Oh, well, that aside, I have to go pick up Deere-kun.

Mun, space magic! You're at the ...... Adventurers' Guild, all right. Let's dash for it!

<blank>

Dia-kun!　Sorry I kept you waiting!

"Ah, sister Karina. Welcome back, have you finished your business meeting?"

<blank>

Dia-kun greets me with a smile. I'm sorry, I was going to go home in the morning at worst!　Oh, it's so bright!

<blank>

I sold the set of massagers I made with Deere for five silver coins. I sold one set of the massager I made with Mr. Dia for five silver coins.

'Did you get such a good price for it?　I'm so happy!"

I'll use it to buy materials, make more, and sell them!　Well, I won't be able to sell it until the imitations come out, but I'll make sure I get my share!"

<blank>

Deere, you develop people, I increase people.

I don't duplicate materials for sale, but it's safe to omit the processing of materials with spatial magic!

<blank>

<blank>

"Hey, hey, Karina. You've been taking your time, haven't you said hello to us?"

Oh, thank you, seniors. Master, water and dinner for the seniors. Oh, and five servings for me and Dea-kun."

I thought you said it was booze."

You've been drinking since noon.　I think it's time for a glass of water."

That's true, too. That's smart."

<blank>

They laugh in a friendly way. Thanks to Harumikazuchi-sister, my pockets are so warm that it doesn't hurt to buy my seniors a meal.

<blank>

Wow, these sandwiches are delicious, the vegetables are so crispy. The butter smells great, too."

I heard that elves don't eat meat. I heard that elves don't eat meat. There's ham in that.

'Oh no, Mr. Braid. I eat meat normally, that's a hoax."

<blank>

Dia-kun, you have completely opened up with your seniors and ...... feel a touch of loneliness!　I feel like my sister, who adores me, gets along with her own friends and leaves me alone!

<blank>

Senior Shirdon, senior Sekko. How was it, Mr. Dia?"

'Good, polite boy. Braid's 'be a good adventurer' ten times."

Hey Karina, is she really a man?　Is it my imagination that she seems to be feminine in her gestures?　The way she tilts her head, or the way she sits with her legs closed so that you can't see inside her skirt..."

<blank>

Hohoho, it's the result of education.

<blank>

'Yes. Slave traders, they've got a replacement and they're back in operation now. And there may be a lot of bargains to be had, as there was a large shipment of goods.

Oh, seriously, Sekko-senpai. Is there a good slave ...... beautiful girl with a reason. I wish I could just see the price."

"Beautiful girl ...... slave ...... ugh, my head."

'Shildon senior, Otsu!　I will overcome those corpses!"

<blank>

By the way, the reason for the large number of arrivals is the alchemical kingdom. Refugees sell themselves, their families, or the slaves they own in order to survive, or something.

<blank>

It seems that the slavers in this town closest to the Alchemy Kingdom are full of such people.

<blank>

Slavers themselves have not fully organized their incoming slaves, and now is the time to take advantage of this great opportunity to find bargains!　We have no choice but to ride this big wave!　We are not afraid to touch your living expenses!

I will secretly tell Mr. Dear a secret story.

<blank>

Hey, Dia, lend me some money!　I'll earn it and pay you back!　I'll pay you back with my body if you want!"

I'm sure you can use the money as you normally would at ....... It's just that your sister says it's my living expenses, so it's kind of like her money from the start."

<blank>

Kyaaa Dear, you're so kind!

<blank>

But I see. If you put it in the form that I lent you the money, it would explain where you got the money to buy the slaves even though you are a new merchant. You are indeed a big sister.

"Yeah, yeah, something like that?"

<blank>

Sorry, I didn't think about that at all. Well, don't worry, I'll pay you back!
