# Was just a business meeting, you know?

<b>

I’m Karina-chan.

The business meeting with my older sister Harumi Kazuchi dragged on, and before I knew it, it was already night.

<b>

"Oh no, I got a bit too enthusiastic... but I was able to enjoy my sister's beautiful and cute appearance, so it's all good!"

<b>

Well, it was just a business meeting, you know? Really, really. I just did a practical demonstration in a private room upstairs. My sister's lips were soft. Hehe. I didn’t remember the last time, so this is practically my first experience.

<b>

Oh, the ones I sold were made from materials I properly consumed. They were materials I took from pirates, but since they’re prototypes and still within the realm of personal transactions, it's safe.

<b>

<b>

By the way, my sister said, "This will be copied soon, it's simple," and also gave me advice from a merchant's perspective, saying, "It would be good to make a lot at first and sell them off." My sister is so kind. I like her!

...Well, if it gets copied, that's fine. If that starts a free competition for massage devices, there might be better massage devices than the ones I make.

<b>

Let's just consider making massage devices, or rather magical tools, as a hobby.

After all, a merchant's job is buying and selling, while making things is the craftsman's job. Karina Shonine-chan is a merchant.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, I need to go pick up Dia-kun.

Hmm, space magic! ...He's at the Adventurers' Guild, good. I'm dashing over!

<b>

"Dia-kun! Sorry for making you wait!"

"Oh, welcome back, Karina-onee-san. Did the business meeting end?"

<b>

Dia-kun greets me with a smile. Ugh, I'm sorry, I was supposed to come back in the morning! Ah, it's so bright!

<b>

"Yeah, it went perfectly. Oh, the massage device I made with Dia-kun sold for five silver coins as a set."

"Did you really get that much for it? I'm so happy!"

"Next, I'll use this money to buy materials, make more, and sell them! Well, it'll probably only sell until the imitation products come out, but I'll make sure to share the profits!"

<b>

Dia-kun is the developer, and I'm the one who increases the quantity.

I won't duplicate the materials for selling, but it's safe to streamline the processing of materials with space magic!

<b>

<b>

"Hey, Karina. You were taking your sweet time, huh? No greeting for us?"

"Oh, thank you, senpai. Master, please bring water and dinner for my senpai. Oh, and five servings including mine and Dia-kun's."

"Isn't it supposed to be alcohol?"

"Well, you've been drinking since noon, right? Water would be better by now."

"That's true. You're quite considerate."

<b>

Wahaha, we laugh together happily. Thanks to my older sister Harumi Kazuchi, my wallet is warm, so treating my senpai to a meal doesn't hurt at all.

<b>

"Wow, this sandwich is crunchy with vegetables and delicious. The butter smells great."

"Hey, Dia. I heard elves don't eat meat. But there's ham in this."

"Oh come on, Blade-san. We eat meat normally, that's just a rumor."

<b>

Dia-kun has really warmed up to the senpai... I feel a twinge of loneliness! It's like my little sister, who admires me, is getting along with my friends and leaving me behind!

<b>

"Shildon-senpai, Sekko-senpai. How was Dia-kun?"

"He's a polite and good kid. Blade's 'become a good adventurer' came up at least ten times."

"Hey, Karina-chan, is that kid really a boy? Is it just my imagination that he has a feminine way of moving? Like tilting his head or sitting with his legs closed to avoid showing under his skirt?"

<b>

Hohoho, that's the result of education.

<b>

"By the way, the slave trader has a successor now and is resuming operations. Apparently, there was a large influx, so there might be some hidden gems."

"Oh, really, Sekko-senpai? I wonder if there are any good slaves... I'd like to at least see the prices of beautiful girls with a backstory."

"Beautiful girl... slave... ugh, my head."

"Shildon-senpai, you’re awesome! I will overcome that corpse!"

<b>

By the way, the reason for the large influx is the Alchemy Kingdom. Refugees are selling themselves to survive, or being sold by their families, or selling off the slaves they own.

<b>

It seems that the slave trader in this town, which is closest to the Alchemy Kingdom, is overflowing with those people.

<b>

Now that the slave trader can't keep up with the influx of slaves, it's a great opportunity to find hidden gems! I have to ride this big wave! I'm not opposed to dipping into Dia-kun's living expenses!

I secretly whisper to Dia-kun.

<b>

"Hey, Dia-kun, lend me some money! I'll make sure to earn and pay you back! I can even pay you back with my body!"

"…You can use it however you want. Just because you say it's for my living expenses, it’s basically your money from the start."

<b>

Kyaa, Dia-kun is so kind!

<b>

"Oh, but I see. If I take the form of lending you money, it explains where a new merchant got the money to buy slaves. As expected of you, onee-san."

"Yeah, yeah, something like that?"

<b>

Sorry, I hadn't thought of that at all. But I'll make sure to pay you back, so don't worry!
