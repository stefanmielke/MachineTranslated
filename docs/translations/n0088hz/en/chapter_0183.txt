# I want to be ...... baked ......

(As expected, Grandma Maria won't join the harem. Karina, I won't mess with your grandma.

Oh, the Five Elders?　You're a loli, right? (Governor's judgment based on the difference in race.)

Kari-chan...... please, I can't take it anymore."

Hmm?　You're such a little girl, aren't you, Mee? Do you want to do it that bad?"

Yes, I want to. I want to ...... me. ......"

I didn't hear you very well. What do you want?"

Uh, せっ......」

What?

Design!　I want to design!　Let me design your workshop!"

<blank>

Yes, so all the Five Elders, led by Mee, have been begging for it.

After inviting everyone to the base and showing them their rooms and planned workshop sites, they couldn't resist.

<blank>

I don't know where he got it from, but he sticks out a letter with "Tangansho" or "Jikiso" written on it on the end of a bamboo stick. Cute.

<blank>

So, can I let you design it, Deere?"

......The plans for the dedication ceremony are well underway, and I'm fine with the design."

<blank>

When Dia said this, everyone burst into smiles.

<blank>

Thank you, Dia!　I'll give you some of my cutest clothes as a thank you!"

I'm a friend of Kali's, so let's go for it. We're Kari's friends, so let's go all out."

Then I'll make underwear. I'll make you some sexy underwear that you like.

'Oh wait, Dia-chan, you're still a child from an elf's point of view, so keep the eroticism down a bit and keep it cute.

A beautiful, pure and innocent girl. No, I like the idea of a gothic lolita, with all the accessories to make it more glamorous."

<blank>

Good for you, Dear. I'm sure you'll get some respectful clothes from the Five Elders.

...... What's that?　Does this mean that Deere will be married to all the Five Elders?

<blank>

We'll give it to Kari once, and then you can give it to Deere.

"Since there is a reward in the form of a design permit, I wonder if it's just a job for you?"

He said, "I don't give a damn about Wachi!　I thought of you as my grandson."

She's your daughter-in-law, isn't she?　She's taken care of Isiah, too, and we're family now."

I just want to decorate it. Elf beautiful girls are cute, and I don't care about the details.

<blank>

Hmmm, yes. Can we just put a cushion for now?

<blank>

<blank>

In addition, I would like to introduce all the Five Elders in the order of their skills after all this time.

<blank>

1st, Mee. Her real name is Vermillion. The girl who gave me a hair ornament. Her first name is Uchi. She is a queen.

Second place, Shih. His real name is Maheshvara. The girl who gave me the knife. Her first name is Achiki.

Third place, Aa. Her real name is Amber. The girl who gave me the storage pouch. Her first name is Wachi.

Fourth place, Coo. Her real name is Carbuncle. She is the grandmother of Sati-tan & Isiah who gave me the ring. Her first name is "I".

5th, Lou. His real name is Barr Zebre. The girl who gave me the cup. First name is me.

<blank>

I heard that the current Five Elders all have "ba" in their names, so they are sometimes referred to as "the Bars" or "the Bars" or "the Bars. I see...the Bars.

<blank>

"By the way, one thing I just realized: if I make room for all the ...... Five Great Elders at my base, will they be commuter wives instead of local wives?"

I think we're already living together from a Dwarf point of view."　It's even closer to my village than the distance we've traveled."

<blank>

Aisia quickly answered my question.

I open the door to my room and I get to the base, so it's practically the same building, right? I see.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

They can build warehouses of any size, with any number of categories, and with no degradation of materials.

"What?　Then we can use fresh ingredients from different seasons!

I was so proud of the pouch I made. I'll make another one and give it back to Kari. ......

Amber, make the bedding and put it in the workshop. And put some in the workshop while you're at it."

"Experiment with dangerous concoctions all you want. ...... Isolate and erase entire worst-case sections?　Amazing."

<blank>

My ability to make things seems to be too attractive to the local wives who are good at making things.

I have a feeling this is going to be a great workshop. ......

<blank>

"...... in case you're wondering, I'll make sure you can't get out except from where you came in, okay?"

What is the principle?　What kind of principle is that?

Hey, can you separate the mixed liquids with that?"

At least you can filter out the impurities, right?　If I ask you, will you do it for me?"

'What happens when you make an alloy that only allows certain substances to pass through, but contains them?'

I think we can do a lot of things like invisible walls. Can we do it with containers?　Or make a furnace out of it?"

<blank>

Wait, wait, the wives are too curious.

Kids are like that, aren't they? Why is it called "why period" or something?　How cute!

<blank>

Whoa. You're building a big bedroom in the workshop. We can all sleep in there."

Yes. Like a love nest for Kali and us?　There's no reason not to make it.

Amber, or rather Ar, makes one of the finest beds in Tessin.

I'm going to put my skills to the test. You can do whatever you want with my body.

Come visit us anytime. We, Kari and I, would love to have you."

We can do it every day!　We can't have young bodies!"

<blank>

If you say a word, it will be returned five times. Love is strong. They are cute.

<blank>

I'm not sure I can control it all that well. I can't control things, so I'll leave it to you.

......A rank adventurer, Masilo-sama. is the awe-inspiring Arthur the Dragon. The Five Elders, who unite Tessin, the land of the dwarves, who treats the "Arthur the Dragon" as a material. The Five Elders, who control the Dwarven nation of Tessin with their material, are the ones who control Dia-sama ...... perfectly, Aruji-sama."

"Wow, Deere, is that amazing?"

In this case, I'm sure your sister Karina is terrific."

<blank>

I'm being played for good by Mr. Masilo, so I'm probably rather at the bottom of the list.
