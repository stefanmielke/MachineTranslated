# I want to... 

(As expected, Maria won't be entering the harem. Karina-chan, you won't make a move on Grandma, right?

Huh, the Five Elders? That's a loli, right? (Judgment based on species difference))

----------------

"Ka-chan... please, I can't hold back anymore."

"Hmm? Really, Mi-chan? You want to do it that much?"

"Yeah, I want to. I want to... do it..."

"I couldn't hear you well with such a small voice. What do you want to do?"

"Um, I want to... do..."

"Do?"

"Design! I want to design! Let me design in my workshop!"

<b>

So, as it turns out, Mi-chan and all the Five Elders have been begging.

After inviting everyone to the base and showing them their respective rooms and planned workshop sites, they seemed unable to hold back.

<b>

They are sticking out letters with words like 'tangan-sho' and 'jikisou' written on them, attached to bamboo sticks. So cute.

<b>

"So, with that said, I suppose I can let you design, right, Dia-kun?"

"â€¦The plan for the return ceremony is going smoothly, so it's fine as long as it's just the design."

<b>

When Dia-kun said that, everyone lit up with smiles.

<b>

"Thank you, Dia-chan! As a thank you, I'll give you the cutest outfit next time!"

"Since we're at it, let's put lots of enchantments on it. You're Ka-chan's friend, so it's okay to go all out."

"Then I'll make some underwear. Something sexy that Ka-chan likes."

"Wait, Dia-chan is still a child in elf terms, so let's tone down the sexy and go for cute."

"Pure and innocent beautiful girl. No, maybe something like gothic lolita would be nice; we can pile on accessories too."

<b>

Good for you, Dia-kun. It looks like you'll be getting clothes made by the Five Elders.

...Huh? Does that mean Dia-kun is also marrying the Five Elders?

<b>

"We'll give it to Ka-chan first, and then you can give it to Dia-chan."

"Since the reward is the design permission, for me, it's just a normal job, I guess?"

"I don't mind at all! I've thought of you like a grandchild."

"Huh? Dia-chan is Ka-chan's bride, right? Aisia has been taking care of you too, so we're already family."

"Anyway, I want to decorate it. The elf beautiful girl is cute, and I don't mind the details."

<b>

Hmm, yeah. For now, should I just put a buffer in place?

<b>

<b>

By the way, just to introduce all the Five Elders in order of skill.

<b>

1st place, Mi-chan. Real name is Vermilion. The one who gave me a hair accessory. Refers to herself as "Uchi." Queen.

2nd place, Shi-chan. Real name is Maheeshivara. The one who gave me a knife. Refers to herself as "Achiki."

3rd place, A-chan. Real name is Amber. The one who gave me a storage pouch. Refers to herself as "Wacchi."

4th place, Ku-chan. Real name is Carbuncle. The one who gave me a ring, Sati-tan & Aisia's grandmother. Refers to herself as "Atashi."

5th place, Ru-chan. Real name is Baalzevul. The one who gave me a cup. Refers to herself as "Watashi."

<b>

Currently, all the Five Elders have "Ba" in their names, so they can be collectively referred to as "Ba-sama-tachi." I see, the Ba-chan's.

<b>

"By the way, I just realized... if I build rooms for all the Five Elders at the base, will I become a commuting wife instead of a local wife?"

"From a dwarf's perspective, isn't it already cohabitation? The travel distance is even shorter than from my village."

<b>

Aisia smoothly answered my question.

If I open the door in my room, I'll arrive at the base, so it's practically the same building, huh? I see.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It's amazing, the size of the land is completely flexible, and you can line up as many warehouses as you want by genre, and you can create things without material degradation."

"Really! Then we can use fresh materials from different seasons together!"

"My pouch was my pride and joy. I should make another one and give it to Ka-chan..."

"Hey Amber, then let's make bedding. Also make some for the workshop."

"Dangerous concoctions can be experimented with freely... worst case, can we isolate and eliminate a whole section? That's amazing."

<b>

With the local wives who are skilled at crafting, my abilities seem incredibly appealing.

I have a feeling the workshop is going to become something incredible...!

<b>

"...For now, I'll make sure you can't leave from where you entered, okay?"

"Can you really separate things based on conditions!? How does that work?"

"Hey, can you separate mixed liquids with that?"

"At the very least, you can filter out impurities, right? Can you do that if I ask?"

"What happens if you prevent only specific substances from passing through and create an alloy containing them?"

"It seems like you could create invisible walls and various other things. Can we make containers too? Like making a furnace with that?"

<b>

Wait, wait, the curiosity of the wives is too strong.

Kids can be like that, right? What do they call it, the why-why phase? So cute~.

<b>

"Oh! You're going to make a big bedroom inside the workshop. We can all sleep together."

"Yeah. It's like our love nest with Ka-chan, right? There's no reason not to make it."

"The bed made by Amber, or rather A-chan, is one of the finest in Tesshin."

"I'll put my heart into making it. Oh, and you can do whatever you want with our bodies, Ka-chan."

"Come visit anytime. We welcome you, Ka-chan!"

"Really, even every day would be fine! We have youthful bodies that we don't know what to do with!"

<b>

Just saying a word brings back five times the response. The love is strong. So cute.

<b>

"Wow, the number of residents at the base just increased dramatically. I really can't control everything, so I'll leave it to Dia-kun."

"...A-rank adventurer, Mashiro-sama. The dragon Arthur, who inspires fear. The Five Elders who lead the Dwarf Kingdom Tesshin, handling materials perfectly, controlled by Dia-sama... is that what you mean, Master?"

"Wow, Dia-kun is amazing?"

"In this case, I think it's Ka-rina onee-san who's amazing."

<b>

I'm being toyed with by Mashiro-san, so I might actually be the lowest one here.
