# The classic TS girls' bath

<blank>

My name is Karina. I'm a beautiful girl and my body smells good, but I decided to go for a bath.

I heard there is a bathhouse called "Kyodo-buro" (communal bath)!

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, there are public bathhouses in this world!

Actually, there was one in Solacidore, though I didn't go there.

<blank>

Can we afford to use so much water and fuel at such a low level of civilization?　You might think, "But this is a world with magic, so there seems to be no problem at all in that area.

<blank>

I mean, bathhouses existed even in the Edo period, right?

They had it around the 2nd millennium BC, and there's no need to be so coy about it. It's there. I'm only going in because it's there.

This is an inspection of a different world bathhouse.

...... It doesn't smell bad. It smells good.

<blank>

<blank>

I've got to get myself together and take a bath.

First of all, the bathhouse has a stone foundation and plaster white walls. At the entrance, there is a noren (curtain) hanging. ...... noren? Is it a public bathhouse? It was a public bathhouse.

<blank>

Once you pass through the blue curtain, you will find a shoebox.

I had my doubts, but I took off my shoes and put them in a shoe box anyway. The key was a wooden board with a slit in it.

There are slatted flooring, so it is easy to walk around without shoes. There is also a guard stand, and it really looks like a public bathhouse.

<blank>

Hmmm, it is surprising that bathhouses in other worlds are so similar to Japanese sento (public bathhouses). I'm sure that when you get down to the function of a bathhouse, it will have the same form--

<blank>

<blank>

How is that possible?

He said, "I'm sure he's a reincarnated person or something. There's no doubt about it. I've never been to a bathhouse with this kind of elaborate design in Japan. It's too elaborate.

<blank>

I wonder if there are others who were thrown into this world by God besides me? Or did God make me create this world as a hobby?　God seemed to know a lot about Japan for nothing, didn't he?

I wonder if they have a board or something with the origin of the public bathhouse there ...... or not. I don't care. I don't really care if there are other converts or not.

<blank>

But I don't understand the exoticism of it. ...... Or maybe it's because it's exotic that they made it thinking of Japan, which can never return?　Hmmm.

<blank>

Well, let's leave the unknown reincarnation alone and take a bath.

<blank>

I pay the fee to the attendant, who may or may not be an old man or an old woman, and may or may not be blind. It is reasonably priced at one medium copper coin. It may be a bit extravagant for daily use, but it seems to have its fair share of customers.

Oh, you sell soap and hand towels too?　I'll buy it, I'll buy it, the little soap for one time is so cute. The hand towel is not for rent, but for purchase. Hi, hi, hi.

<blank>

The changing room. This place is very much like a public bathhouse. There is a basket on the shelf where you put your undressed clothes.

I quickly undressed, as I had become accustomed to doing over the past few days, and in an instant I was completely naked.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, let's take a hot bath!

<blank>

When I entered the bathroom with enthusiasm, I was met with a flurry of gazes. What's up, old man?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

...... Yikes, I'm a woman now!

<blank>

I'm sorry!　I made a mistake!　I'm sorry!"

<blank>

With a jerk, I turned back, grabbed the clothes I had shoved into the basket, and headed toward the red curtain.

Oh shit! ...... Did you get a look at her boobs?　Is it safe to go down there?　She was hiding them with a hand towel!

<blank>

'Wow, I'm in a hurry. Whew. ......"

<blank>

We take a break when we enter the women's changing room.

From next door, "Lascivious! Where did you run off to?　I'll wash your back!" "Hey, your women's underwear is on the floor!" I heard a voice saying, "I don't know. ...... No, wait, did I drop my underwear?　Hmm?　No, it's right there.　That's not mine. Scary.

<blank>

Well, let's take a bath again.

But I feel like it smells muffled and sweet from the air. Is the composition of the hot water different from that of the men's bath?　I guess it must be different, the broth!

<blank>

'Heh heh ...... No well, now I'm a woman too. Yeah, yeah, force majeure force majeure."

<blank>

Now it was time to go to a woman's garden!　I stepped into the bathroom.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Well, the ladies loved me so much!

<blank>

I was so stupid to go to the men's bath by mistake.　You were so stupid to go to the men's bath by mistake.

In your village, did you go in with the men?　"In the village, did you go in with the men? But in the town, it was only children who had not yet been weaned.

Some brothels do that, but this is a lord's bathhouse, so remember that."

<blank>

That's how it felt. It was a chat IN the bathtub. Reality is so harsh.

<blank>

Hah, I'm afraid. Domo. Usu, azasu.

I was embarrassed that my own breasts looked more disgusting than those of my aunts. ...... I'm not sure if it's the resilience or the youthfulness or the ...... sense of being ready for battle?

<blank>

You've got a nice body, even for a man. Let me rub you a little, it will bring you good luck.

...... if you'll buy me a fruit milk later?"

You're so thoughtful!　You can rub mine, too. I'm proud to say that I've raised five children with them, so maybe it will bring you good luck in child rearing.

"Ha-ha-ha. I can expect a safe delivery with Grandma Maria's breasts.

Wow, thanks."

Kari, can I have a rubdown with you too?　My husband and I haven't been together for a while.

<blank>

What can I say?

I wondered if simply having meat on your chest is not the same as having boobs.

I think I understand what God means when he says, "Shame is the best spice.

<blank>

Oh, and the fruit milk I was offered as a treat was usually delicious.

It was a cup, not a bottle, but I heard that it is mannerly to drink with your hands on your hips. Phew.
