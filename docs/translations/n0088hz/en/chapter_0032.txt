# The Classic of Bathing with TS Girls

<b>

I am Karina-chan. Being a beautiful girl, my body smells nice, but I decided to go to the bath.

Apparently, there’s a public bathhouse called a "kyoudou-buro"!

<b>

<b>

Yes, in this world, there are public bathhouses!

Actually, there was one in Sorashidore too, but I hadn’t gone.

<b>

You might think, "How can they afford to waste so much water and fuel with such a low level of civilization?" but this is a world with magic, so that doesn’t seem to be a problem at all.

<b>

I mean, there were bathhouses even in the Edo period, right?

They seem to have existed around 2000 BC, so there’s no need to nitpick. They exist, so I’m just going to use them.

This is an inspection of an otherworldly bathhouse.

…It doesn’t smell bad at all. It smells nice.

<b>

<b>

Let’s get back on track and go to the bath.

First, the exterior of the bathhouse is a stone foundation with white plaster walls. There’s a noren hanging at the entrance… a noren? Is this a sentou? It was a sentou.

<b>

If I pass through the blue noren, what awaits is a shoe locker.

I have my thoughts, but for now, I take off my shoes and toss them into the locker. The key is one of those with a notch in a wooden board.

There’s a wooden slat on the floor, making it easy to walk even without shoes. And there’s a reception desk, making it very much like a sentou.

<b>

Hmm, I’m surprised that a bathhouse in another world resembles a Japanese sentou this much. Surely, if you refine the function of a bathhouse, it would take the same form――

<b>

<b>

No way that’s possible!

There’s no doubt that someone like a reincarnator made this. No question about it. I’ve never been to such a traditional sentou in Japan. It’s too elaborate.

<b>

I wonder if there are others like me who were thrown into this world by a god. Or did the god make it as a hobby? The god seemed to have an unnecessary amount of knowledge about Japan.

I wonder if there’s a plaque explaining the origin of sentou around here… Nope, probably not. Well, whatever. I don’t really care if there are other reincarnators or not.

<b>

But those who don’t understand the exotic atmosphere… No, maybe because it’s foreign, they made it thinking of Japan, which they can’t return to? Hmm.

<b>

Well, I’ll leave the unknown reincarnators alone and focus on the bath.

<b>

I pay the bathing fee to the old man at the reception, who I can’t tell if he’s blind or not. One medium copper coin, which is a reasonable price. It might be a bit luxurious to go every day, but it seems there are quite a few customers.

Oh, they sell soap and hand towels too? I’ll buy some. The tiny soap for one use is cute. The hand towel isn’t a rental but a purchase, one large copper coin. Okay, okay.

<b>

In the changing room. This is very much like a sentou too. There’s a shelf with baskets where you put your clothes.

I’ve gotten used to it over the past few days, so I quickly take off my clothes and become completely naked in an instant.

<b>

<b>

"Alright, time for a good soak!"

<b>

As I enter the bathing area with enthusiasm, all eyes turned towards me. What’s with the old man looking this way… huh…

<b>

<b>

<b>

…Oh no, I’m a girl right now!!

<b>

"I-I’m sorry! That was a mistake!! My bad!!"

<b>

I quickly turn around, grab my clothes from the basket, and head towards the red noren.

That was close… Did they see my breasts? Was my lower half safe? I was hiding it with the hand towel!

<b>

"Wow, that was a scare. Phew…"

<b>

I take a breath as I enter the women’s changing room.

From next door, I hear voices like "Pervert!" "Where did she go!? I’ll wash your back!" "Hey, there’s women’s underwear lying around!" but I don’t care. …Wait, did I drop my underwear? Huh? No, it’s still there?? That’s not mine. Scary.

<b>

Now, let’s properly get into the bath.

However, it feels like there’s a sweet smell in the air, different from the men’s bath? It must be different, right? The broth!!

<b>

"Hehe… Well, I’m a girl now too. Yeah, yeah, it’s unavoidable, unavoidable."

<b>

Here I go, into the women’s paradise! I stepped into the bathing area.

<b>

＊　＊　＊

<b>

Wow, the old ladies were really nice to me.

<b>

"Ahaha, was this your first bath since coming from the village? How silly to accidentally go into the men’s bath."

"Were you bathing with the men in the village? That kind of village where women bathe together does exist sometimes. But in town, it’s only for kids who can’t wean off their mothers."

"There are places like that in the entertainment district, but this is the lord’s bathhouse, so remember that it’s not allowed here."

<b>

That’s how it was. Casual chatting in the bath. Reality is harsh.

<b>

Ahh, I’m flattered. Thank you. Yes, thanks.

…But, honestly, I felt a bit embarrassed that my chest felt more suggestive than the old ladies’. The firmness or youth… the feeling of being in a state of readiness?

<b>

"By the way, you have a nice body. Let me touch it a bit; it seems lucky."

"…If you buy me some fruit milk later?"

"You’re quite the opportunist! Then I’ll let you touch mine too. These are my pride after raising five kids, so they might bring you good fortune in parenting."

"Ahaha. With Maria’s chest, you can expect an easy delivery."

"Wow, how wonderful."

"Karichan, can I have a feel too? I haven’t been with my husband lately."

<b>

What can I say.

Having meat on your chest is different from having breasts.

I think I finally understand what the god meant by "Shame is the best spice."

<b>

Oh, the complimentary fruit milk was delicious.

It was in a cup instead of a bottle, but apparently, it’s proper etiquette to place your hand on your hip and drink it all at once. Phew.
