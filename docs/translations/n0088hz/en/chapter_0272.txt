# Alchemy Kingdom, what kind of evil deeds did they commit?

<b>

Well then. For that reason, we decided to take a look at the territory of the former Alchemy Kingdom.

<b>

"Wow. This is convenient. To be able to see the whole world from my room... Isn't this military secret completely exposed? Don't use it elsewhere, okay?"

"…Oh, that's dangerous!?"

"I know that without being told. Just for my own use."

<b>

First, the former royal capital. …Hmm, a crater. It seems that reconstruction is not progressing!

<b>

"Whoa. What is this…? This can't be the work of humanity."

"Yeah, the gods went on a rampage."

"Huh? That seemingly kind god went on a rampage? What kind of evil deeds did the Alchemy Kingdom commit?"

<b>

By the way, the god that Misha is meeting is, of course, a false god modeled after a goddess statue.

The essence is real, so it's basically the same thing.

<b>

"Seemingly kind, huh? As expected of a god."

"Nyahaha! I regularly get my butt curse exorcised!"

"Oh, good for you, Misha."

<b>

Misha puffs out her chest proudly towards Mashiro-san.

However, Misha's butt isn't actually cursed; she's just being called because the god wants to mess with her butt. She's just getting spanked. "As long as this treatment continues, there's no chance of it worsening," but in the first place, there's no curse to worsen.

<b>

...One could say she is receiving favor. Yeah.

<b>

"By the way, if Mashiro-san wants to meet the god, I could ask if it's okay?"

"Huh? W-wait... uh..."

'...I want to strip the strong-willed beast girl and put a collar on her, making her walk on all fours in the town! She can only wear socks!'

"Oh, sorry, I can't let Mashiro-san meet the god after all."

"W-wait?? I-I see..."

<b>

Mashiro-san looks a bit disappointed, but I'm sorry. It's for the sake of Mashiro-san's dignity.

<b>

"Nyahaha! You're being rejected!"

"Shut up! There are fewer humans who can meet the god!!"

"Well, anyway, the Alchemy Kingdom has incurred the wrath of the gods. It can't be helped."

<b>

As a warning, the Alchemy Kingdom will likely remain like this for the time being.

<b>

<b>

"Still, there aren't any people left at all."

"That's true. From above, you can't see the shadows of rubble, but… oh, is that a roper?"

"Those are tentacles. They’re a bit tasty when roasted."

<b>

There was an area with tentacles resembling sea anemones, but there were no signs of human presence at all.

<b>

"Did all the humans die cleanly? If it’s the wrath of the gods, that’s possible."

"No, aside from the self-proclaimed chaos god old man, they weren't particularly focused on killing, so I think there are survivors..."

"Ha! Could it be that the roper from earlier is a human transformed into tentacles!? Divine punishment!?"

"That sounds scary. I don't think it's the work of the god, though."

<b>

Transforming people into tentacles, that's not something in the tutorial...

…………

Speaking of which, they did replicate the old man's arm into a grotesque form. Oh no, that's possible.

<b>

"Well, that’s probably not the case. They’re generally tolerant of unrelated civilians."

<b>

One could also say indifference. However, socks are a different matter.

<b>

<b>

"Huh? There's a settlement a little distance away."

"Huh? Is it a village from the Alchemy Kingdom? I didn't know such places survived."

"Or it could be a hideout for thieves! There's a pattern where a village gets attacked and taken over!"

<b>

With that in mind, we decided to investigate that settlement a bit more closely.
