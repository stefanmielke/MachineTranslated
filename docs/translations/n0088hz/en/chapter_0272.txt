# Alchemy Kingdom, what evil have you done?

<blank>

Well, well, well. So we decided to take a look at the territory of the former Alchemy Kingdom.

<blank>

Wow, that's convenient. You can see the whole world from the comfort of your own room. ...... This kind of thing is a complete military secret, isn't it? Don't use it anywhere else.

"......Oh, that's bad!"

'I know you don't have to tell me. For myself, for myself."

<blank>

First up is the former royal capital. ...... Hmmm, crater. I don't see any reconstruction going on!

<blank>

"Wow, what the hell is this? This is not the work of ...... humans."

Yeah, God went on a rampage, didn't he?"

What?　That kind and gentle God is going on a rampage?　What kind of misdeed did he do, Alchemy Kingdom?

<blank>

The god Misha is meeting is, of course, a false goddess motif.

It's not really the same thing, though, because what's inside is real.

<blank>

He said, "You're so kind, God. You're a quintessential God."

Nyahahahaha, I regularly have my butt curses exorcised!"

"Oh, well, good for you, Misha."

<blank>

Hmmm," says Misha, puffing out her chest proudly at Masilo.

But Misha's ass isn't separately cursed, and God is only calling her because he wants to mess with Misha's ass. It's just being spanked. I'm being sent for a curse that doesn't exist, that never gets worse, that never gets better, that never gets worse, that never gets better.

<blank>

I guess you could say I'm playing favorites with ....... Yup.

<blank>

'Well, Mr. Masiello, if you want to see God, I'll ask if I can see him?'

What?　Wait, what?　Wait ...... eh ......"

I'd love to see her on all fours with her clothes stripped down and a collar on!　I'll just wear socks!

I'm sorry, but I can't do it. I can't let Mr. Masirow meet God."

Oh, oh?　Well, yeah. ......"

<blank>

Mr. Masilo looks a little disappointed, but I'm sorry. I'm just trying to protect Mr. Masiello's dignity.

<blank>

Nyahahaha!"　They rejected me!"

"Shut up!　Not many people get to see God!

Well, anyway, the alchemy kingdom has offended God. It can't be helped.

<blank>

By way of example, the alchemy kingdom will remain as it is for the time being.

<blank>

<blank>

But there's no one left, no one at all.

I think so. From up there, I can't see the shadows of debris and stuff, but ...... oh, is that Roper?"

Tentacles. They're kind of tasty when they're roasted.

<blank>

There was one area with tentacles that looked like sea anemones, but no sign of people at all.

<blank>

"Did all the humans die clean?　If it's the wrath of God, it's possible.

No, except for the old man who called himself the god of chaos, I didn't particularly consciously kill him, so there are survivors and such, I think. ......

"Ha!　That Roper just now, he's a human being turned into a tentacle!　It's a divine punishment!

I'm scared. I don't think God did it."

<blank>

Turning people into tentacles, that's not the kind of thing you can do in a tutorial: ......

............

Well, they could have done something like that, like absurdly duplicating the old man's arm and turning him into a deformity. Yikes, it's possible.

<blank>

I don't think it's a quirk. I'm very tolerant of ordinary people who have nothing to do with it."

<blank>

It is also called indifference. Except for socks.

<blank>

<blank>

What's that?　There's a village-like thing a little ways away.

Hmm?"　A village in the Alchemy Kingdom?　Is that what's left of it?"

Or it could be a place where bandits live!　Or the village could be attacked and taken over!"

<blank>

That is why I decided to investigate the village a little more closely.
