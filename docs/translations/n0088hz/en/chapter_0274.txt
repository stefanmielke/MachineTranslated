# New Alchemy Kingdom

<b>

"Senpai, Blade-senpai!"

"Mm? Oh, Karina, it's been a while! Did you come to take a request too?"

<b>

A request. I see, so that's how it is. Thank you for the quick information!

<b>

"No, I'm just passing by."

"Passing by? This isn't exactly a place to just pass by. Well, whatever."

"So, senpai, you have a request, huh?"

"Yeah. It's a request from the 'New Alchemy Kingdom' for the reconstruction of the new royal capital!"

<b>

I hear they pay five silver coins per person per day, which is quite generous—though to me now, it's just pocket change.

Still, what is this 'New Alchemy Kingdom'? Is it safe to say that the second and subsequent ranks of the Alchemy Kingdom are trying to rebuild the country?

<b>

"Where are Shildon-senpai and Sekko-senpai?"

"Oh, Shildon is over there clearing debris, and Sekko is running around as a messenger. I'm here helping with the food distribution."

<b>

Now that I think about it, senpai was wearing an apron and peeling potatoes with a knife in hand.

Hmm, it feels fitting. It suits him.

<b>

"Isn't this the time for your woodworking skills...?"

"I helped out when they were building temporary housing. But it seems like the cooking duty got pushed onto me. Everyone else doesn't want to do it and doesn't want to let me do it either."

<b>

Apparently, it's not just about cooking skills; they can't trust unreliable people to prepare food.

In other words, Blade-senpai was entrusted with the food because of his good character. Impressive.

<b>

"Meow meow, Karina. This guy doesn't seem very strong, but is he really your senpai?"

"Watch your mouth, Misha. Senpai is a great benefactor who taught me the basics of being an adventurer."

"Meow!? Hey, you! Why didn't you teach this guy more common sense!?"

"...Ah, yeah, sorry? I was also being led around by Karina."

"Oh, I see. I'm sorry for asking too much."

<b>

Blade-senpai and Misha shake hands firmly. What is this friendship? A connection centered around me?

<b>

"Oh, by the way, I'm Misha! If you mention the Gale of Terrarial Ruby, you're talking about me!"

"Gale!? That A-rank adventurer!?"

"Eh, what? Besides 'The Butt that Pleases the Gods,' did I have another title?"

"Don't say that!"

<b>

And he was the same A-rank as Mashiro-san. I didn't know that.

<b>

"...Ah, um. I'm Blade, a C-rank adventurer. Nice to meet you."

"What? C? Did you just say C? Meow, I was on guard because you said you were Karina's senpai, but it's not a big deal—uh, wait, meow! Karina also had a time when she was a beginner, and you're the benefactor who helped her back then!"

<b>

Alright, it seems like she remembered her place after I pinched her butt. Don't speak ill of senpai, Misha.

<b>

"Senpai, this is my pet, so you don't have to be formal! Right, Misha?"

"Yes, I'm a pet, meow, I'm sorry!"

"O-Oh... Hey, Karina, what the heck is going on with you having a Gale as your subordinate...?"

"Well, well, let's not get into the details. Oh, do you want help peeling the potatoes?"

"Oh, then I'll leave that basket to you."

<b>

With spatial magic, poof. There, the skins are off.

<b>

"I'm done. Here you go. Oh, I'll do that one too."

"Oh, magic is really amazing. Here, it's not much, but here's a tip, take it."

<b>

With that, Blade-senpai tossed me a silver coin. Wow, just for peeling potatoes, that's about ten thousand yen. So generous. That's one-fifth of Blade-senpai's daily wage, is that okay?

<b>

"If I were to do it normally, it would take that much time, so it's a reasonable amount."

"Then how about I cut it up and put it in the pot as a bonus?"

"Hey, hey, I won't give you any more tips, okay? Well, if it's done, you should eat too."

<b>

Thus, I helped Blade-senpai with his work. And with the extra time, I decided to listen to more stories.
