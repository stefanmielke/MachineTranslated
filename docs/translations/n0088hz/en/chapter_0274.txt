# The New Alchemy Kingdom

<blank>

"Hey, Blade, hey!"

Hmm?"　I thought, "Oh, isn't that Karina? It's been a while!　You're here at my request too?"

<blank>

Request. I see, that's what I heard. Thanks for the prompt information!

<blank>

No, I'm just passing through."

I'm just passing through. ...... is not the place to pass through, is it? Oh well."

So, what's your senior's request?

"Oh. The "New Alchemy Kingdom" has asked me to do some reconstruction work in the new royal capital!"

<blank>

I heard that they were quite generous, giving each of us five silver coins a day - a small amount of money from my current perspective.

But what is the "New Alchemy Kingdom"? Does this mean that the second and later generations of the Alchemy Kingdom are trying to revive the country?

<blank>

Where are Shildon senior and Sekko senior?"

Oh," he said. Shirdon is over there clearing rubble and Sekko is running around as a messenger. I'm helping out with the soup kitchen.

<blank>

If you ask me, the senior was wearing an apron and peeling potatoes with a knife in one hand.

Hmmm, it kind of fits. It suits me.

<blank>

"When your woodworking skills are in play, you can ......?"

I helped build the temporary housing. I was in charge of cooking, but I'm being forced to do it. People don't want to do it, and they don't want me to do it."

<blank>

Anything, he said, is a good cook, but he can't entrust the preparation of a meal to someone he doesn't trust.

In other words, I was entrusted with food by the virtue of Braid's senpai. That's a wonderful thing.

<blank>

Nyah-nyah, Karina. He doesn't look very strong, but is he really Karina's senior?"

Misha," he said, "watch your mouth. You owe me a great debt of gratitude for teaching me how to be an adventurer."

Hey!　Hey, why didn't you teach him more common sense?

I'm sorry?　I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry I was so unreasonable. I'm sorry for asking so much of you.

<blank>

Braid-senpai and Misha shaking hands firmly. What is this friendship? Is it a relationship centered on me?

<blank>

Oh, by the way, I'm Misha!　When I say gusts of terra realby, I mean me!"

"Gustwind!　That A-rank adventurer!"

What? Besides 'God-pleasing ass,' did you have two other names like that?"

You can't say that!

<blank>

And you were ranked A, just like Mr. Masilo. I didn't know that.

<blank>

"...... Uh, let's see, I'm Blade, a C-rank adventurer. Nice to meet you."

Did you just say "C"?　I was a little defensive because you said you were Kalina's senior, but it's not that big of a deal!　Kalina was a beginner too, and she was a benefactor who helped me back then!

<blank>

Okay, okay, I pinched his butt and he remembered his position. Don't speak ill of your seniors, Misha.

<blank>

He said, "Senpai, this is our pet, so don't be afraid of it!　Misha!

Yes, pet, sorry."

"Oh, oh ...... hey Karina, what the hell is wrong with you and why are you following the gale ......?"

I'll help you peel the potatoes. Shall I help you peel the potatoes?

"Oh, well, I'll take care of that basket over there."

<blank>

Whiff with spatial magic. Yes, skinned.

<blank>

I'm done. I'll do that one, too. Oh, I'll do that one too.

Oh. Magic is really amazing. Here, it's not much, but it's your reward.

<blank>

And Blade-senpai gave me a silver coin. Wow, about 10,000 yen just for peeling a potato. That's a lot of money. That's one-fifth of Blade-senpai's daily wage.

<blank>

It's a fair price for the amount it would cost if I peeled it the normal way.

Then, as a bonus, I'll cut it up and put it in the pot."

"Hey, hey, hey, I ain't paying you no more money.　Well, you can have it when you're done."

<blank>

Thus, I helped senior Blade with his work. Then, I decided to listen to him further in the time I had left.
