# Entry

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina! I’ve decided to participate in a certain rock-paper-scissors tournament at the invitation of my best friend Misha!

But that tournament has a stripping rule! To protect my soft skin, Dia-kun will also participate... Kyaa. I like Dia-kun! I will do my best to win to protect Dia-kun too!!

<b>

It’s also convenient that I’m wearing a gothic lolita outfit. With the stripping rule, having more clothing is an advantage.

<b>

Yes. So, together with Misha, we smoothly head to the entry.

Huh? It’s quite noisy. A man at the reception is arguing with someone wearing a bandana and wristbands.

<b>

“Hey! Don’t you dare try to register as a man for this tournament!”

“My heart is a woman!”

“Shut up! You were hitting on women at the tavern!”

“No, my heart is a woman and I’m a homosexual!”

“Nobody’s paying to see your naked body! You better pay the viewing fee quietly!”

“...Tch, I thought I could see some women’s naked bodies.”

<b>

A man was trying to register at the reception in the back alley but got rejected.

Well, that’s to be expected.

<b>

“...Um, miss. I should probably stop too, right?”

“Oh! You girls over there, want to participate in the rock-paper-scissors tournament!? ...Whoa, such a beautiful girl...! Eh, so cute... I can’t think of any words other than cute...”

<b>

The receptionist looked at me, Misha, and then Dia-kun in order, becoming fixated on Dia-kun.

Hehe, he seems like a promising guy.

<b>

“Ah, I’m here to participate, nya!”

“Hehe, let’s have a good match, Misha.”

“...Ugh. I’ll participate...”

“Seriously!? Thank you! Thank you!! ...Ah, but age-wise it’s cutting it close... No, what’s the point of a backdoor tournament! If you’re an elf, you’re definitely safe based on your real age...!!”

<b>

Hiding our gender, we successfully completed the entry including Dia-kun. It’s their fault for not asking.

Well, with Dia-kun, it should be fine even if he gets stripped. There was a time when I was treated as a pervert elf when I entered the men’s bathhouse...

<b>

“There are 16 participants... You need to win 4 times to become the champion, nya. Don’t lose until you face me, okay?”

“...I can’t believe 16 people gathered for such a tournament.”

“Because the perverted old men pay well, nya! Even if they lose, if they just show their naked bodies, they can get 15 silver coins, so they’ll participate. If it’s a stingy tournament, participants won’t gather, so everyone pays.”

<b>

150,000 yen (according to Karina-chan's research)...! This world doesn’t have erotic videos, huh. Other than directly spending at shops, it leads to things like this.

<b>

“Also, it’s not a fistfight, so even if there aren’t enough participants, the older sisters from that kind of shop will participate as reserves.”

“Professionals, huh. They must be strong. Mentally.”

<b>

In Japan, there were also instances in the past where actresses appearing in erotic videos participated in swimming tournaments with accidental exposure. It’s that kind of thing.

<b>

Now, shall we begin the dark tournament...!

I’ll make sure to have my opponents wear socks!!

<b>

<b>

“...Am I really out of place here?”

“No, seriously, wouldn’t it be better to quit now? Ah, if you win the first match, your opponent in the second round will be me. It’ll be a final match with Karina.”

“...I-I will protect you, miss!!”

“Are you really going to push yourself? Huh?”

<b>

Misha is so kind... The fact that she’s wearing striped socks today is a high point too.

<b>

<b>

Oh. Speaking of which, I completely forgot about Misha’s socks, but I also forgot to deliver Dia-kun’s socks...

<b>

“Ah! Really!? I can’t believe I forgot Dia-kun’s socks!!”

<b>

God? Please don’t interrupt my thoughts with such a clear voice. Is there a god shelf nearby?

<b>

“Damn you, Misha-chan, this girl makes me very happy! Fearsome, the butt that pleases the gods...! I want to put on pantyhose and create a 16-beat rhythm.”

<b>

Oh. Misha has officially become the “butt that pleases the gods.” Good for her.
