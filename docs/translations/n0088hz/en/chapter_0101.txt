# Just a little "movement," huh?

(Congratulations on the 100th chapter! (excluding the cover))

A large door with a relief suddenly appeared in the cave. It seems to be the door to the boss room.

That said, it’s not the final boss of the dungeon. That’s a story for after passing through this boss room to the lower levels. In other words, it’s a mid-boss room.

<b>

“Who prepares doors like this? Do you know, Aishia?”

“Well, it’s a magical tool to prevent the boss from going outside. I’ve heard stories from people who went to undeveloped dungeons to install doors at the adventurer's guild tavern. They say they request a skilled adventurer for protection.”

“Oh, so this was actually installed by someone.”

<b>

The presence of the door indicates that the dungeon has been developed.

And it seems that the boss of this boss room will eventually revive after being defeated. Apparently, it respawns inside due to the effect of this door. How convenient.

<b>

“Wait, Karikari, are you really going to challenge the boss room?”

“Of course! Look, it’s been a breeze up to this point, right? The boss shouldn’t be that tough either.”

“The boss room is a different story, you know? …If we die, it’s game over, so there’s no need to go to a dangerous place, right? We’re merchants after all. We’re the ones who buy materials from adventurers. Right?”

<b>

Oh no, I’ve been stopped by Sati-chan.

<b>

“It’s okay, Sati-san. We can defeat it safely. We have a strategy.”

“Is that so? Tell me about it.”

<b>

Then, Dia-kun persuades Sati-chan. Since it’s my first time hearing it, I’ll listen in as well.

<b>

“First, the boss here is the Red Hornet. Its minions are the Yellow Hornets. Overall, they are weak to fire. And I can use fire magic.”

“Oh, Dia-san can use fire magic? You haven’t used it until now.”

“Because I wouldn’t be able to gather materials. I had voluntarily sealed it.”

<b>

But in a boss battle, it’s a different story.

<b>

“I’ll give up on the minion materials and take them all out with a Fire Wall. If it’s just the Red Hornet, Karina-onee-san won’t lose.”

“Yeah, I can handle it easily.”

<b>

Even though it would be easy with the minions around, I don’t need to say that in front of Sati-chan.

<b>

“It’s a Red Hornet, you know? It’s three times faster and bigger than a Yellow Hornet, are you sure you’re okay?”

“Ha, you shouldn’t underestimate me, Sati-chan. Depending on the place, I might want to be underestimated, but let’s save that for tonight, shall we? Just kidding!”

“Hmm, if it seems like it’s going to be bad, we can escape right away, okay?”

<b>

By the way, the Red Hornet is said to appear as a weak monster in the deeper layers.

(At the very back, there’s a queen bee called the Mother Hornet waiting with her nest. Dia-kun and Aishia have been gathering information, which is impressive.)

<b>

“If it comes down to it, I’ll go all out too.”

“Sati-chan’s serious side… I’m curious.”

“It costs money, you know… I’ll be using expensive alcohol…”

“Ah, yes.”

<b>

It seems better not to expect too much from Sati-chan’s trump card. There’s no need for it anyway.

<b>

<b>

“Master, Dia-sama. Excuse me, but I, Aishia, will open the door!”

<b>

Aishia placed her hands on the double door and pushed it open—inside the room were five Yellow Hornets and one Red Hornet. Yep, it’s red. And this bee is about the size of a puppy. Scary. I get a physiological shiver, so don’t come near me.

<b>

“Wall of flames, block my enemies, Fire Wall!”

<b>

As Dia-kun cast the spell, a wall of flames appeared and engulfed the Yellow Hornets. In no time, the materials were gone. Namu.

<b>

“Onee-san, I leave the rest to you!”

“Okay, let’s see. What should I do with this?”

<b>

Then, I circled behind the Red Hornet, grabbed its thin wings, and tore them off. Alright, now it can’t fly anymore.

<b>

“Whoa, that was fast. Karikari, what did you just do?”

“What do you mean… I just ‘moved’ a little, you know?”

<b>

I said it with a cool pose. I wanted to say this line.

Well, in reality, I used space magic for instant teleportation and fixed the Red Hornet, so it wasn’t just a little movement. Moreover, I was watching Sati-chan to time the teleportation with her blink. I loved her serious cute face. Love.

<b>

“...Karikari, you were really strong, huh?”

“Well, yeah!”

<b>

While showing a smile to Sati-chan, I ripped off the head of the Red Hornet, and the first boss battle ended.

I plan to rewrite it extensively.)
