# It just "worked" a little bit, didn't it?

A large door with relief suddenly appeared in the cave. It seems to be the door to the boss's room.

However, it is not the last boss of the dungeon. That is the story after you go to the lower level, past this boss room. It is the middle boss room, so to speak.

<blank>

Who prepares these doors? Do you know Isiah?"

'Uh, it's a magical tool that keeps the bosses out. I have heard of people who have dived into undeveloped dungeons to put doors on them at the Adventurer's Guild bar. I heard that they ask for a great adventurer to escort them out."

Oh, this was properly put on by a person."

<blank>

The fact that it has a door on it means it's a sign of a developed dungeon.

And it is said that the boss in this boss room will eventually come back to life when he is defeated. I heard that the effect of this door is to cause a fixed boil inside it. How convenient.

<blank>

'What, Crunchy, are you really going to attack the　The boss room?"

I'll do it, okay?　See, you've had it easy so far. I bet the boss isn't too big of a deal either, huh?"

The boss room is a bit of a different story. ...... If you die, it's over, so why go to all the trouble of going to a dangerous place?　We are merchants, you know. You can also use the same type of equipment as the boss's room. Right?

<blank>

Oops, Sati-tan stopped me.

<blank>

Don't worry, Sati. We can take them down safely. We have a plan."

"Really?　You want to hear it?"

<blank>

And Dear, you convince Saty-tan. I'm new to this too, so I'll ask.

<blank>

First of all, the boss here is the Red Hornet. His cronies are the Yellow Hornet. And they are generally weak against fire. And I can use fire magic.

"Ah, Dia-san, you can use fire magic?　I didn't use it."

We couldn't get the material," he said. I voluntarily sealed it off."

<blank>

But if it's a boss fight, it's a different story.

<blank>

She gives up on the crony material, and just goes all in with the firewall. If you only deal with the Red Hornet, sister Karina is the first to lose."

I'm sure you're right. I'd have an easy time."

<blank>

It would be easier with cronies, but I don't have to tell you that in front of Sati-tan.

<blank>

It's the Red Hornet, okay?　It's three times faster and bigger than the Yellow Hornet, okay?"

I don't want you to lick me, Sati-tan. I'd like you to lick me in some places, but I'll have you do that tonight.　Oh, my God!"

"Well, if it doesn't work, I'll be able to get out of here, won't I?"

<blank>

Red Hornet, by the way, seems to be a monster that only appears as a small fish in the deeper levels.

(I heard that a queen bee called Mother Hornet is waiting with her hive at the far end. (I heard that a queen bee called Mother Hornet is waiting with a hive at the innermost part of the building.)

<blank>

I'll get serious when the time comes, okay?

I'm curious about Saty-tan's real ......"

"It costs money, ...... because we use expensive alcohol. ......

"Ah, hi."

<blank>

As for Satyan's backdoor, I don't think we should get our hopes up. There is no need for it.

<blank>

<blank>

'Aruji-sama, Dia-sama. With your permission, I, Isiah, will open the door for you!"

<blank>

Aisia put her hand on the double doors and gingerly opened them - and there were five Yellow Hornets and one Red Hornet in the room. Yeah, red. And as big as a puppy, you bee. They're scary. They give me the physiological creeps, so don't go near them.

<blank>

"Wall of flame, block my foe, Firewall!"

<blank>

As Mr. Dear cast a spell, a wall of flame appeared and swallowed the Yellow Hornet. In no time, the material was dead. Nah-moo.

<blank>

Sister, I'll take care of the rest!"

Yes, yes, yes, yes. What should I do with this?"

<blank>

I walked up behind the Red Hornet, grabbed a handful of its flimsy wings, and tore them off. Yes, now I can't fly anymore.

<blank>

What? Crunchy, what did you just do?"

What do you mean, ......, it just "moved" a little bit?

<blank>

I'm going to say it in a crisp and stylish way. I've always wanted to say this line.

Well, actually, it wasn't just moving at all, because I was using spatial magic to move instantaneously & fix the Red Hornet or something. Moreover, I was looking at Sati-tan to match the timing of the instantaneous movement with her blink. I loved how serious her cute face was. LOVE.

<blank>

...... Crunchy, you were really strong."

Well!"

<blank>

With a smile on Satitan's face, he ripped off the Red Hornet's head and his first boss fight was over.
