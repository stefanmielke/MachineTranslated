# I should have left one more behind

<b>

After finishing the first day, I decided to stay overnight in the waiting room.

I could have gone back to the inn, but it's not every day you get to sleep in the tournament's waiting room!

<b>

Well, Aishia and Dia-kun had dinner here with me, but they went back to the base. It would have been nice to sleep in the same room together.

<b>

"So, I've called Mashiro-san."

"......Seriously, the atmosphere is like the Central Colosseum of Terralia, Terralia One."

"That's true, right?"

<b>

Mashiro-san says that crossing the border without permission is illegal immigration... but as long as we don't leave this room, it's fine. Yeah. I believe Mashiro-san will handle that properly.

<b>

"By the way, I thought I'd ask about this country. I know it's a bit late."

"I've told you various things before, right? That's pretty much all there is to it."

"By the way, I'm currently participating in the tournament with the money I borrowed from Mashiro-san."

"Alright, ask me anything."

<b>

Now that Mashiro-san is being cooperative, let's ask some questions.

<b>

"Then, I want to confirm again... the king is also from the White Wolf tribe, right? Just like you, Mashiro-san?"

"Yeah. Lord Barbaros is also from the White Wolf tribe. Oh, and if you end up facing him in the tournament, don't hold back—just beat him up. That old man is really popular, but he loses in tournaments from time to time, so there's no need to worry about it."

<b>

Mashiro-san calls the king "that old man."

<b>

"Well, technically, he's a relative, even if it's really distant. We've fought in tournaments before. I couldn't win, but I put up a good fight."

"Oh, it's amazing that you couldn't win, Mashiro-san!"

"Who are you to say that??"

<b>

Well, you can't win on the bed, can you? Right?

<b>

"Well, General Garou might be tougher."

"Is that so?"

"The Black Wolf tribe is hard to find when they blend into the darkness. The White Wolf tribe during the day, the Black Wolf tribe at night."

"I see! ...But the tournament is held during the bright daytime, right?"

"They use hidden weapons and such. I dabble in it a bit, but the Black Wolf tribe is serious about it, you know?"

<b>

If we face the Black Wolf tribe, it seems wise to strengthen our defenses.

<b>

"Well, either way, they're not your enemy. Just win and let me earn as much as possible."

"Yeah, leave it to me. If I keep winning, it'll be ten times—if you include the extra from Dia-kun, it'll be two hundred times!"

"......You left one gold coin with Karina, right?"

"If things go this way, it'll become two hundred gold coins."

"Kuhi..."

<b>

Mashiro-san's face twitched.

<b>

"......Sorry, I let out a weird laugh."

"Oh, that was a laugh? I've never seen that before."

"Ha, seriously? One gold coin turning into two hundred? That's an insane profit... It makes working seriously seem ridiculous. ...I should have left one more behind."

<b>

Though Mashiro-san says that, with the comment "Now I can order equipment from the Five Elders' sisters," it seems they have no intention of quitting being an adventurer.

<b>

"By the way, Karina. I heard you had eleven consecutive battles in the tournament?"

"Yeah, after that, we took a break and fought once more, and it feels like it's continuing tomorrow. It seems like they did all the preliminaries today?"

"You fought a lot... If you fought that much, you must be really excited, right?"

<b>

As they said that, Mashiro-san sat on the bed provided in the room and patted it.

...Oh? This feels like an invitation?

Alright, I'm in! I'm ready!

So, I sat down next to Mashiro-san.

<b>

C-Come at me (defensive)

<b>

"You called me here after sending Dia and the others back, right? Alright, it's rent time. I always wanted to try it in a room like this."

"......Kuun!"

<b>

Since Mashiro-san paid me plenty of rent, I felt like I could approach tomorrow's tournament with a refreshed mindset.
