# I should have deposited another one.

<blank>

After the first day, I decided to stay directly in the waiting room.

I could have gone back to the inn, but it's not every day you get to stay overnight in the waiting room of a convention!

<blank>

Well, Isiah and Dia ate dinner together here, but went back to the base. It would have been nice to sleep together in the room.

<blank>

That's why I invited Mr. Masiello.

...... seriously the air is terra real b's, terra rear one's, central coliseum."

Yeah, but what?"

<blank>

Masilo says if you cross the border without permission, you're smuggling yourself in. ...... but all you have to do is stay out of this room. I'm sure Masilo-san will take care of that. I'm sure Masilo-san will take care of that.

<blank>

I thought I'd ask you about this country while I'm at it." It's a little late for that."

I've said a lot of things before.　That's pretty much all I said."

By the way, I'm currently competing in a tournament with the money that Mr. Masilo gave me.

All right, ask me anything you want."

<blank>

Now that Mr. Masiello is more open to cooperation, let me ask you a question.

<blank>

'So, I just want to confirm again that the ...... king is a white wolf tribe too, right?　Just like Mr. Masiello."

Oh. Mr. Barbaros is a white wolf tribe, too. Oh, and if you run into him at a tournament, don't be afraid to beat him up. That old man is the most popular, but he loses a lot of tournaments, so there's nothing to worry about.

<blank>

You call the king an old man, Mr. Masilo.

<blank>

I'm a relative, albeit a very distant one," he said. We fought in a tournament once. We didn't win, but we put up a good fight.

'Oh, how amazing that Mr. Masiello can't win!'

You say that?"

<blank>

Well, you can't win in bed, right? Right?

<blank>

Well, maybe General Garowe is tougher."

Really?"

The Black Werewolves are hard to find in the dark. White wolves by day, black wolves by night.

'I see! Even at ...... we do our conventions in daylight, right?"

I'm a bit of a tamper, but the Black Werewolves are serious. I'm a bit of a tamper, but the Black Wolves are serious, you know?"

<blank>

If you are going to hit the Black Wolf Tribe, it would be better to have a good defense.

<blank>

Well, either way, I ain't your enemy. Let me win and earn my keep."

If we win, we'll multiply it by ten - two hundred if you include Deere's increase! If we win this, it will be ten times as much - two hundred times if you include the increase from Deere!

...... you deposited one gold coin with Carina, didn't you?"

If we keep this up, we'll be at 200 gold pieces."

Kuhitu ......."

<blank>

Masiello's face was drawn.

<blank>

I'm sorry ......, I just had a funny laugh."

I said, "Oh, that was a laugh. I've never seen that before."

'Hah, seriously? 200 gold coins for 1 gold coin?　It's a huge profit. ...... It makes me feel like an idiot for taking my job seriously. I should have ...... deposited another one.

<blank>

He says, "Now I can order equipment from the Five Elder Misses," and I guess he has no intention of quitting as an adventurer.

<blank>

By the way, Karina. I heard you played 11 straight rounds in the tournament?"

Oh yeah." After that, we had a break, and then we had one fight, and then we'll continue tomorrow. So it's like we did all the qualifying rounds today?"

"You fought so hard ......, you must be pretty pumped up, huh?"

<blank>

Masilo sat down on the bed that was provided in the room and patted it while saying.

...... Oh?　This is an invitation, right?

Alright, I'll give you a ride!　I'm ready, man!

I sat down a little next to Masilo-san.

<blank>

Come on, take it.

<blank>

You sent Deerboy and his friends home and called me for this, didn't you?　I'm going to do this in a room like this once. I've always wanted to do it in a room like this.

"...... kun!"

<blank>

With Mashiro paying me plenty of rent, I was going to be able to tackle tomorrow's competition with a refreshed mind.
