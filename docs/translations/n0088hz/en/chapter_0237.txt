# You're quite something, aren't you?

<b>

And then, Loo-chan accidentally told Misha that she is the Baal Zebul of the Five Elders.

<b>

"......You're quite something, aren't you? Marrying one of the Five Elders... Well, if you're a messenger of the gods, I guess that could happen."

<b>

Wow, this cat just accepted it without a second thought. As expected of a best friend.

<b>

"Hey! You can't just say that without permission, Kari-chan!"

"That's right! It's our little enjoyment!"

"We'll need you to spend some quality time with us tonight."

"Oh, right! Let's sleep together tonight, okay?"

"If that's decided, we need to make some stamina boosters. Let's have a dinner that boosts our vitality too."

<b>

Aww, I'm sorry! But let's sleep together at night, okay? Hehe.

<b>

"Oh, Misha, do you want to join us? I can look at you with lewd eyes!!"

"I'll pass, thank you. I mean, having five madams for a 6P is quite something..."

"Being held down by four lolis is the best! And the last one gets to play with me as they please. Hehe, everyone is such a mischievous child."

"Loli... Ah, Karina is the type who doesn't know the age of dwarves."

"Intellectually, I understand the actual age and all, but somehow! My instincts prioritize appearance! They're such cute wives, after all."

<b>

When I brag, the five of them blush cutely.

<b>

"「「「「「...I love you, Kari-chan!」」」」」

"I love you too—!!"

<b>

I won't hold back from flirting in front of Misha! We're newlyweds after all!

<b>

"Hey, hey, who's that half-girl's grandma?"

"Hm? You mean Aishia? That's me!"

<b>

Then, Kuu-chan raises her hand.

<b>

"......She really looks about the same age as my dad."

"That's Carbuncle Shounin. Nice to meet you!"

<b>

Oh, Kuu-chan is also claiming to be a Shounin. Hehe. That's nice!

<b>

"Carbuncle... Oh! You have the same name as the Carbuncle of the Five Elders!"

"Hm? Ah, sorry, hold on a sec."

<b>

Then, the Five Elders start whispering among themselves.

<b>

"......Could it be that only Loo-chan thinks she's the only one of the Five Elders?"

"That's possible. She seems a bit silly."

"Alright! Let's all introduce ourselves properly!"

"Hehe, I also claimed to be a Shounin."

"I'm the only one who got spoiled by Kari-chan, huh? Today, I'm the number one!"

<b>

They finish their conversation and come back.

<b>

"......I'm Vermilion Shounin!"

"I'm Maheeshbara Shounin! Let's get along!"

"I'm Amber Shounin! Nice to meet you!"

"I'm Carbuncle Shounin! I said it before, but I'll say it again!"

"And I'm Baal Zebul Shounin...!!"

<b>

"「「「「「All five together... Neo-Five Elders!!!!」」」」」

<b>

Boom! An unnecessarily explosive introduction.

What’s with that five-colored explosion? Did you create a new magical tool? That's so cool!!

<b>

"Hehe, I referenced the sentai stuff that Kari-chan mentioned."

"I see. That's nice, Mii-chan. Let me use it next time; it sounds fun."

"Instead, I'll create a special color just for you, Kari-chan. What color should it be? Black? That glossy black like obsidian is your image color, right?"

"Black is more like the position of an additional warrior. Sounds good!"

<b>

As Mii-chan and I playfully fist-bump, Misha seems to be thinking about something.

<b>

"......! I got it!!"

"Hm? What's wrong, Misha?"

"Kariina, did you gather dwarves with the same name as the Five Elders!? That's not good; if the real ones find out, they'll definitely get mad!! You should at least stop letting them claim to be the Five Elders!!"

<b>

Misha points her finger at me and says this.

It's true that if everyone were really fake Five Elders, they might get scolded by the real ones. Misha is surprisingly sensible.

<b>

"......No, they're all the real deal, you know?"

"No way a real one could be this young!!!!"

<b>

Did the information about having a grandchild like Aishia just vanish from her mind?

Huh? You think it's a step-grandchild? So that's how it is.

<b>

<b>

"Alright, just as I expected, a silly person."

"Now the information that Loo-chan is one of the Five Elders has been reset."

"So, no monopolizing, okay, Loo-chan?"

"We're taking turns properly."

"Aww, that's too bad."

<b>

By the way, it was decided that the real Five Elders wouldn't get mad over something like this.

In fact, it seems there are quite a few who admire the Five Elders among the fake five-member group. While they crack down on malicious scams, names like "Neo-Five Elders," "Under Five Elders," or "Five Elders Next" aren't a problem as long as they don't cause any issues.
