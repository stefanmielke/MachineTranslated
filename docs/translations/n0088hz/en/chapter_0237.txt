# You're a terrible person!

<blank>

And I told Misha that Roo is the Barr Zebre of the Five Elders.

<blank>

I've been told, "...... you're a hell of a guy. I hear you're taking the Five Elders as your wife. ...... Well, if God sent you, that's possible."

<blank>

Wow this cat, I've accepted you as normal. That's my best friend.

<blank>

"Oh, no!　You can't just say whatever you want, Kari!"

Yes," he said!　The trivial pleasures of the Atchirs!"

I'll have to let you guys take your time with this one tonight.

"Oh, yes, that's right!　You're sleeping with us today, right?"

I'm going to have to make a spermicide. I'll have to make him an energizer for dinner, too.

<blank>

Sorry about that. But let's sleep together at night!　Heh heh heh.

<blank>

Oh, and Misha, will you join us?　I can look at Misha with naughty eyes!"

I don't want to do it. I'm not going to have a six-pack with five madams. ......

"I love it when four loli hold me down by my extremities!　And then the last one plays with me as he pleases. Ahehe, they're all naughty!"

Lori ...... ah, Karina is the type of dwarf who doesn't know how old she is."

I know from a knowledgeable point of view that my real age is such and such, but I just can't help it!　My instinct is to put appearance first!　They are lovely wives."

<blank>

When I fall in love with them, the five of them are adorably embarrassed.

<blank>

「「「「「......Love Kari! 」」」」」

I love it too!"

<blank>

We'll make out mercilessly in front of Misha, too!　We're newlyweds!

<blank>

Who's that half-assed auntie of yours?"

Hmm?"　You mean Isiah?　Then it's me.

<blank>

And Coo raises his hand.

<blank>

...... I guess he looks about the same as our guy."

I'm Carbuncle Shaunin. Nice to meet you."

<blank>

Oh, Coo-chan has also come up with the name Shonin. Hehe. I'm so happy!

<blank>

Carbuncle ...... Oh!　It's the same name as the Great Old Carbuncle, isn't it?

Hmm?　Oh, sorry, a little time."

<blank>

And all the Five Elders talk secretly.

<blank>

...... do you think maybe Lou is the only one of the Five Elders?"

It's possible. You look silly."

I dare all of you to say your names properly!"　I dare all of you to say your name properly!"

"Heh heh, I called myself Shaunin, too."

'I'm the only one who got spoiled by Kari - I'm the best today...'

<blank>

Finish the story and come back.

<blank>

...... ours is Vermillion Shaunin!"

Maheshvara Shonin!　Be good to me, too!"

Wachi, Amber Shonin!　Yororo!"

Carbuncle Shaunine!　I said it earlier, but I'll say it again!"

And I'm Baarzebul Seanin ......!

<blank>

「「「「「The Five Together......The Neo Five Elders！！！！！」」」」」

<blank>

Dooooooooo!　and it's an introduction with a useless explosion effect.

What's with that 5-color explosion, did you make a new magical tool?　That's so cool!

<blank>

I was referring to what Kari-chan said about the "squadron" thing.

I see. That's good, Mee-chan. Let me use it next time, it sounds fun.

I'd rather make a special color for Kari. What color?　Black?　That obsidian-like glossy black is Kari's image color, isn't it?

Black or additional warrior positives. Great!"

<blank>

Misha was thinking about something as he and Meechan were playing with each other, fist to fist.

<blank>

"......!　Okay, nya!"

"Hmm?　What's up, Misha?"

Karina, you've collected dwarves with the same names as the Five Elders!　You should at least not let them call themselves the Five Elders!　At least don't let them call themselves the Five Elders!

<blank>

Bishii!　says Misha, pointing his finger at me.

Surely if everyone really was a fake Fifth Elder, they might be offended by the real one. You are a surprisingly sensible person, Misha.

<blank>

...... No, they're all real, okay?"

The real one can't be this young. ！！！！

<blank>

Has the information that I have a grandchild like Isiah with this look gone over my head?

What?　You think he's your step-grandson?　Oh, I see.

<blank>

<blank>

Okay, I was as dumb as I was supposed to be."

Now the information that Lou is a Grand Elder is reset, too."

That's why you can't have it all to yourself, Lou."

We're all taking turns.

I'll just have to do it."

<blank>

Incidentally, it was decided that the real Five Elders would not be offended by this so it was okay.

In fact, it is said that there are many fake "Five Elders" in Tessin who are admirers of the "Five Elders. They are said to be fine as long as they do not cause any problems with their names such as "Neo Five Elders," "Five Elders Behind the Scenes," or "Five Elders Next," although malicious frauds will be dealt with.
