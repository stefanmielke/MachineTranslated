# Enchanting Elf Competitor (Audience Perspective)

<b>

In this tournament, unless you apply, your name will not be disclosed.

Generally, the ones who disclose their names are professional courtesans, and those names are work-related pseudonyms—so-called stage names.

<b>

Given that it is such a tournament, the audience was greatly excited about the mysterious beautiful girl, the enchanting elf competitor.

<b>

"Haah, is that elf girl going to be okay? Legally speaking, I mean."

"If she's an elf, her real age is probably high, so it seems like she's on the borderline, right?"

<b>

In the first match, she faced off against the strongest yet weakest bear beastman courtesan.

<b>

That bear beastman was of a type with a strong fur-covered beastly appearance.

The strongest is likely a fierce warrior far removed from the average person who would participate in this tournament, and honestly, you could probably earn more by just participating in regular tournaments or hunts.

The weakest is a professional who has an exhibitionist tendency and works at a shop, meaning it's fine for her to lose. Above all, she often loses on purpose.

...Well, she is a regular participant in this tournament to the extent that she is called that.

<b>

Then in the second match, she clashed with a cat beastman and ended up losing.

She fought valiantly but left the stage in a very enticing appearance, wearing only two panniers and an upper undergarment.

In fact, it was also a matter of having a bad opponent. After all, her opponent was a fierce warrior who had recently placed second in another major tournament. It was truly out of place.

<b>

"If the elf competitor had faced a normal girl, she would have wiped the floor with her. Seems like she has bad luck."

"Still, why did such a beautiful girl come to this tournament?"

"Well... I know that girl. ...She's a tamer, apparently."

"A tamer? That's the one who has monsters fight while they're weak themselves, right? ...Oh, but there are some who are relatively strong to make the monsters obey them."

<b>

That girl doesn't seem like such a skilled tamer, he said, and was met with a "Tsk, tsk, tsk, that's where you're wrong~."

<b>

"What do you mean, 'that's where you're wrong'? Don't keep me in suspense."

"That elf girl won the 'Tamer Cup.' And she brought a dragon with her."

"Huh? A dragon??? Wait, the dragon from that story!?"

"What other dragon could there be? Yeah, the one that's called a disaster."

<b>

That's why he remembered it so well, the man said.

<b>

"...So why on earth is someone like that participating in such a ridiculous tournament? I mean, I'm happy about it, but still."

"She might actually be into this sort of thing. Maybe she's the type who wants to be seen!"

<b>

The man said excitedly and happily.

<b>

"Then she's quite the perverted kid."

"The silhouette of her butt visible through that sheer pannier was irresistible!"

"Yeah. She's going to be an incredible beauty in the future. I can't tell about her chest, though..."

<b>

Imagining the future of the elf girl, they nodded in satisfaction.

After that, they continued to discuss various things about the elf competitor—mainly about what kind of outfits would suit her and how she must wash her body starting from her ears, engaging in such trivial chatter.

<b>

As expected of a rare species and an extraordinary beauty, the discussions blossomed and turned into a flower garden.

<b>

—However, they never realized that the elf girl was actually a boy.

...If they had realized, it wouldn't have been surprising if the door to their shotacon tendencies had opened, so perhaps it was fortunate in that regard.
