# Fascinating Elf Players (Audience Perspective)

<blank>

At this convention, no names will be released to the public unless you apply.

It is usually professional prostitutes who publish their names, and their names are also pseudonyms for work - so-called source names.

<blank>

Since this was such a tournament, the audience was very excited about the unidentified beautiful girl, the enchanting elf player.

<blank>

'Hahaha, that little elf, is he alright? In terms of ordinances and stuff like that."

If you're an elf, you're older than you really are, so you're kind of on the edge, aren't you?"

<blank>

In the first round, he was up against the strongest and weakest bear-beast whore.

<blank>

That bear-beastman is a type with a strong beastliness of fur all over its body.

The strongest, because you are probably the fiercest, far from the average person in this tournament, and you would probably make more money if you were in a normal tournament or hunt.

The weakest, because they have a propensity for dewiness, wanting to take off their clothes, and are in a professional slot where they can lose, working in a store. Above all, they lose on purpose.

...... Well, I am a regular participant in this tournament, so called.

<blank>

Then, in the second round, I bumped into a cat-beastman and lost.

Although she put up a good fight, she left the stage looking very intriguing, wearing only two panniers and top underwear.

In fact, it was the wrong opponent. After all, the opponent was a fierce competitor who had recently won second place in another major tournament. I had to say that he was way out of place.

<blank>

The elf player, if his opponent had been a normal girl, would have been able to finish him off. It looks like bad luck."

But then again, how did such a beautiful woman end up in this tournament?"

"Say, ......?　Oh, but I know that girl. She's a ...... tamer."

A tamer?　The tamer? That's the guy who makes the demons fight and he's weak, right? ...... "Yes, there are some who are strong enough to make the demons listen to them, but..."

<blank>

When I say, "She doesn't look that great," she denies it, saying, "Tch tch, that's the thing.

<blank>

"So what?　Don't be a prude."

That elf girl won the "Followers' Cup" with a dragon. And she did it with a dragon."

"What about?　Dragon?　What? Dragon, that dragon!

Which other dragons are there? Yes, the one they call a disaster or something."

<blank>

That's why I remembered him so well. A man who said.

<blank>

"...... more and more, I'm wondering why such a thing is in this joke of a tournament.　No, I'm happy for me."

Maybe I'm more of a likeable person than you think. Maybe you're the type that likes to be seen!"

<blank>

The man says excitedly and happily.

<blank>

If so, he's a very horny kid."

I just couldn't resist the silhouette of her ass through that sheer pannier!"

Oh, she's going to be so beautiful in the future. She's going to be very beautiful in the future. I don't know about the breasts, but ......"

<blank>

She imagines a future for the elf girl and nods in satisfaction.

After that, we continue to discuss various things about the elves - mainly, how they look good dressed like this, how they probably wash their bodies from the ears when they wash, and other such trivial chit-chat.

<blank>

The discussion blossomed and turned into a flower garden, as she was, after all, a rare species and a stunningly beautiful woman.

<blank>

--I was not aware that the elf girl was actually a man.

If I had noticed ......, I could have opened the door to shorty sexuality, so I should say that I was lucky.

I'm going to concentrate on updating that one for a bit, since it's not quite up to the default number of words!

I thought the deadline was the end of February, but the deadline is February 1!)
