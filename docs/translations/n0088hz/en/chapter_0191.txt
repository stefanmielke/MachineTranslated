# Everyone with the Five Elders and Mashiro-san

<b>

"Hey? Looks like there's a drinking party going on."

<b>

When I returned to the base after working as a healer with Aishia, everyone from the Five Elders and Mashiro-san were having a drinking party.

Oh, dried crawler meat. This stuff can be quite addictive. The rehydrated version is good too, but the dry one has its own charm.

<b>

"Hey, Karina! We were just drinking with the new ladies. Seriously, if you're going to have more residents, you should introduce them properly!"

"Ah, yeah. Sorry about that."

<b>

Looks like they're already quite tipsy.

Huh, what's with this big barrel? It's filled with fire liquor. Wait, did Lou-chan make this? Oh wow. …Isn't this more than what I bought the other day? Wait, are we going to finish all of this today? O-oh. As expected of dwarves.

<b>

"Alright, let me introduce you briefly. This is Mashiro-san. And over here are the Five Elders."

"「「「「「Nice to meet you!」」」」」"

"Uh, nice to… Gotaireo?… G-G-Great Elders!?"

<b>

Mashiro-san choked. Want some water? Here you go.

<b>

"See, if you don't know their true identity, you'll just end up becoming friends by the flow of things, right?"

"Wha- are you stupid?! Think about common sense! My buzz just wore off!! I didn't know the Five Elders weren't old people, I didn't hear they were this young!!"

<b>

Mashiro-san shouted as if about to snap at me. Her tail fluffed up. Fluffed up. What is that, what kind of emotion is that? Wow, I want to pet her.

<b>

"Hey, dwarves look young, right? I can't tell the difference at all."

"Well, I can tell a bit by the smell… but this level of drunkenness is off the charts…"

"Ah, maybe I made you a bit younger. Yeah."

<b>

Saying that, Mashiro-san held her eyes and opened her mouth wide, looking up at the sky.

<b>

Wait, Mashiro-san can tell a dwarf's age by smell.

As expected of Mashiro-san.

<b>

"Aw, what a cute reaction! You can call me Mi-san like you did earlier, okay?"

"That's right. Call me Shi-san, okay? Come on, come on."

"Fluffy fluffy, your tail is wonderful, I want to use it as a pillow."

"If your buzz has worn off, you can drink a lot more now, Mashiro-chan."

"Don't hold back, okay? Here, let me refill your drink."

"O-oh. Th-thank you very much…"

<b>

Ah, everyone knew and was hiding the fact that they were the Five Elders, right? Mashiro-san is serious, so her reaction to this reveal is really fun, right? I get it.

<b>

"Geez, everyone loves to tease. Don't mess with Mashiro-san too much, okay? But be friendly with her!"

"「「「「「Okay!」」」」」"

<b>

Everyone answered cutely while raising their hands. Yeah, they really get along well. All five of them are good friends.

<b>

"Hey… ah, you can't treat her like a child…!?"

"Come on, Mashiro-chan, let’s continue drinking with us!"

<b>

Mashiro-san was firmly grabbed by her tail by Mi-chan.

<b>

"Alright, I think I'll join in too! I did some work today, so it's fine, right Aishia?"

"In that case, please go to the workshop and drink. It might be bad for Dear-sama's education. I'll bring the snacks."

"…That’s right! Everyone, let’s move to the workshop!"

<b>

After that, my memory, as usual, went blank…

But for some reason, when we all took a morning bath together the next day, everyone from the Five Elders had started to call Mashiro-san with an honorific.

<b>

I wonder what we did in our drunken state, I have no idea.

(It seems that empty bottles of aphrodisiac bought by the Five Elders were rolling around in the workshop's bedroom.)
