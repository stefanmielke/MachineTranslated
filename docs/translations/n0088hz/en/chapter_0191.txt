# All the Five Elders and Mr. Masilo

<blank>

What's going on?　They're having a drink."

<blank>

When I returned to the base after working as a healer with Isiah, all the Five Elders and Mr. Masilo were having a drink.

Oh, crawler dried meat. It's quite addictive, isn't it? I like it when it's rehydrated, but it's also great when it's dried.

<blank>

Oh, Karina!　I was just having a drink with my new sisters. If you're going to have new residents, you might as well introduce them properly!

I'm sorry. Yeah, sorry, sorry."

<blank>

You're all done.

What is this big barrel? It's all fire wine inside. Is it Rou-chan's handmade?　Heh. ...... is more than I bought the other day, isn't it?　Oh, you're going to empty it all today?　Oh, oh. That's Dowa.

<blank>

Let me briefly introduce you. This is Mr. Masiro. This is the Five Elders.

「「「「「 regards 」」」」」

"Oh, good ...... Gotairou? ......Gotairou?"

<blank>

Mr. Masiello swallowed. Do you want some water?　Here you go.

<blank>

You see, if I don't know who you are, I'll just go along with the flow and we'll be friends, right?"

Bubba, you idiot!　Think of common sense, common sense!　I'm sobering up!　I thought the Five Elders were old men, I didn't know they were this young!

<blank>

Masilo screams at me as if he is about to bite me. His tail is wagging. Bubu-wubu. What kind of emotion is that?　Wow, I want to fluff it up.

<blank>

He said, "You know, Dwarves look so young. I can't tell them apart at all."

No, I can tell a little with my nose, but ...... it's not like my nose was damaged by alcohol, ......"

'Oh, maybe it's because I made them a little younger. Yeah."

<blank>

When I said this, Masirosan held his eyes and looked up to the heavens with his mouth gaping open.

<blank>

I mean, Masilo-san can tell how old a dwarf is, by smell.

That's what Mashiro-san is all about, isn't it?

<blank>

I was like, "Oh, that's such a cute response!　You can call me Mr. Mee like you did before, okay?"

Oh, yes, yes, yes. Call me Mr. Shih?　Come on, come on.

"Fluff, fluff, fluff, I love your tail, I wish I could use it as a pillow..."

Now that you're sober, you can drink a lot again, Masilo."

"Don't be shy, I'll pour you another drink.

Oh, oh. Oh, arigatoo gozaimasu ......"

<blank>

Oh, you all knew that and hid it from us, didn't you?　Masirosan is very serious, so it's fun to see his reaction when he reveals something like this, isn't it? I understand.

<blank>

You know, everyone likes to play pranks. Don't tease him too much, okay?　But be nice to him!

「「「「「 yes 」」」」」

<blank>

They all raised their hands and answered cutely, "Yes, yes, yes! The five of us are all good friends, aren't we?

<blank>

"Hey ...... oh my god, you can't treat me like such a child ......!"

"Hey, Masilo, you're going to continue drinking with us.

<blank>

Mashiro's tail is grabbed by Mee-chan.

<blank>

'Yoshi, I think I'll join you!　I've done one job today, right, Isiah?"

If so, go to the workshop and have a drink. It would be bad for Master Dia's education. I will deliver the snacks.

"...... right!　Guys - we're moving to the workshop!"

<blank>

After that, my memory has flown, as usual. ......

For some reason, when we all took a morning bath together the next day, all of the Five Elders began to call Mr. Masiro by his "san" name.

<blank>

I don't know what he did when he was drunk.

(It appears that there were empty bottles of aphrodisiacs purchased by the Five Elders lying around in the bedroom of the workshop.)
