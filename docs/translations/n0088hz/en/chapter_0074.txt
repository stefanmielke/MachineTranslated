# ダミーナ・ニセイシャ（仮）

（I participated in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel festival with a sushi deck, and I bought half-price sushi at the supermarket, but I dropped it and spilled the contents all over the supermarket floor. (Ｔ-Ｔ) So sad.）

I am Karina-chan! I came to the slave trader with some great deals!

Is there a suitable bargain slave among us?

If it's a girl who looks good in socks, that would be perfect!!

<b>

<b>

"Good-looking women and those with skills tend to be quite expensive... so for one gold coin..."

<b>

Well, that's only natural.

Even if there are several in stock, the pick of the lot would likely go straight to the brothel. By the time the senior adventurers hear about it, the professionals have probably already fished through them.

Still, with this stock, there should be some hidden gems that even the pros couldn't pick up.

<b>

"Would it be impossible for the uneducated?"

"If the purchase price is too low, it would be a loss. I ask for your understanding. Even an uneducated village girl would be worth three gold coins, and if she's a cute girl... ah, would a baby be acceptable?"

"A baby is completely off the table."

<b>

Wait, they even buy babies? The last safety net isn't just for show.

Hmm, well, I'm not trying to haggle too hard. Three gold coins could be within budget.

But if I casually reveal my budget limit, I'll just get squeezed dry. I should probe a little more.

<b>

"I'm fine with minor injuries. Is there anything good and cheap?"

"Ah, if you're okay with treatment, I do have some stock available. However, including the treatment costs, it often ends up being more economical to buy a decent slave from the start."

"Depending on the extent of the injuries, I have connections that can treat them cheaply, so we can discuss that."

"That sounds enviable. If you could introduce me to that connection, I might be able to offer further discounts."

<b>

Oh, so there are such things.

Should I introduce Karina Daimahotsukai... wait a minute?

I was only thinking about getting a slave to do something lewd with socks... but what if it was something like this?

<b>

～・～・～・～・～・～・～・～

<b>

"My name is Damina Niseisha (temporary). Now, let’s heal your daughter's injuries. The treatment fee is five gold coins and your daughter's socks."

"W-What an outrageous fee! And socks, too!? But for my daughter... I understand, I will pay!"

"That's the word I wanted to hear! Oh, passing merchant. Please sell me the tools needed for the treatment ritual. The receipt should be addressed to Damina Niseisha (temporary)."

"Sure thing! (Secretly treating Karina-chan)"

"Now, I will perform the ritual... hey hey, muhn! (Pretending to heal since she's already fine)... phew. Now, I will take the gold coins and the socks. That was Damina Niseisha (temporary)."

"Ugh, my daughter was indeed saved. But still, five gold coins is outrageous. Curse you, Damina! And to take my daughter's socks, what a pervert you are. Curse you, curse you, Damina!"

<b>

～・～・～・～・～・～・～・～

<b>

And so, I have a role that takes on the bad reputation in my place.

Yeah, not bad. Not bad at all.

<b>

If I become famous, I might not be able to wander around food stalls freely anymore. And if I become a pervert who collects socks as a life work, even more so.

So! I will set up the slave I’m about to buy as my substitute!

<b>

<b>

It's a sudden thought, but this is a brilliant idea.

Even if I wear a mask, Maria-baba would see right through it, but if I were a completely different person, I wouldn't be caught!

If I introduce the slave trader as a connection for treatment, it seems like I wouldn't have to worry about running out of work!!

<b>

Also, when Dia-kun asks me, "Why are you buying a slave?" I can have a plausible excuse!!!

<b>

Ahem.

<b>

"It's difficult to introduce someone right now, so could you give me a discount later if I introduce them and you refund part of the payment?"

"That's fine. The refund amount will depend on how useful the connection is."

"Alright, negotiation settled. Now, let me see the actual slave. Oh, if she’s just missing an arm, that’s fine. Ideally, I’d prefer one arm, but I wouldn’t mind if she’s missing both arms."

"Huh? ...I-I see."

<b>

If she's missing legs, I won't be able to collect socks even if I heal her.

<b>

"…In that case, I have just the right person. A former bard who has lost both arms, beauty, and voice. The price is one gold coin, which is quite reasonable. Can you really heal her?"

<b>

Whoa, this is a perfect match.

What is this, is God wanting her socks?

Got it, I just need to heal her. Leave it to me.
