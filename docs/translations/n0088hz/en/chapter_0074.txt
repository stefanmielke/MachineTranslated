# Damina Nisseisha (tentative)

(I ran the Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel festival with a sushi deck, so I bought some half-priced sushi at the supermarket, but I dropped it and smashed the contents all over the supermarket floor. (T-T) I cry...)

My name is Karina!　I've come to the slaver with a great deal in my hand!

Do you have any bargain slaves worthy of our company?

If a girl looks good in socks, nothing to say!

<blank>

<blank>

A good-looking woman or a skilled man will still cost you a lot of money. ......

<blank>

Well, of course.

As one would expect, even with such a large inventory, the best of the best would be immediately sent to the whorehouse. If the senior adventurers are hearing about it, it must have already been scavenged by professionals in that field.

Still, with this number of arrivals, there must be some bargains that even the professionals could not pick up.

<blank>

"Can't even get an uneducated one?"

If you undercut the purchase price, you will lose money. Please forgive me. An uneducated village girl will be worth three gold coins, and a pretty girl, say, ...... ah, even a baby?"

'Babies are completely out of scope, I guess.

<blank>

Or rather, buying even babies? The last safety net is not so great.

Hmmm, well, I'm not forcing myself to bargain. Three gold coins is well within my budget.

But if you simply give up the budget cap, you will be squeezed. Let's explore a little more.

<blank>

I don't care if it's a little scratched up. I just need something nice and cheap."

If you want to treat them, we have some in stock. However, if you include the cost of treatment, it is often more economical to buy a decent slave from the beginning.

Depending on the condition of the wound, I may be able to help you at a discount.

I envy you. If you introduce me to your contact, we may be able to offer you a further discount.

<blank>

Hoho, is that one of them?

Let me introduce you to Karina Dymahotsky: ...... No, wait?

Slave, I was only thinking of picking socks or doing something nasty, but how about something like this ......?

<blank>



<blank>

My name is Damina Nisseisha (tentative). Come, let me heal your daughter's wounds. The cost of the treatment is five gold coins and your daughter's socks."

That's outrageous!　And with socks!　But for my daughter's sake, I'll pay ...... Okay, I'll pay!"

I wanted to hear you say that!　Ah, a passing merchant. Please sell me the tools needed for the healing ritual. The receipt should be addressed to Damina Niseisha (pseudonym)."

Yes, maido! (Carina-chan secretly treating him)"

"Then we will perform the ritual. ...... Ee-ei, mmmm! (He's already healed, so I'll pretend to heal him.)...... I'll take the gold coins and socks, then. This is Damina Nisseisha.

The girl was saved, but five gold coins were still outrageous. But five gold coins are still outrageous. Damina, you son of a bitch!　And what a pervert to take my daughter's socks. Damina, Damina, Damina!

And, like that, he is an attendant who takes on notoriety on my behalf.

Yeah, not bad. Not bad.

<blank>

If he becomes a celebrity, he may not be able to freely visit food stalls. If you are a pervert who makes collecting socks your life's work, even more so.

So there!　You will take the place of the slave you are about to buy!

<blank>

<blank>

This is a sudden idea, but it's a good one.

Even if I had put on a mask, Old Maria would have recognized me, but if I had been a different person in the first place, she wouldn't have!

If we introduce them to the slavers here as a source of treatment, we are sure to get a lot of work done!

<blank>

Also, when Mr. Dear asks me, "Why are you buying slaves?" and it's a good excuse like that when he asks for an explanation!

<blank>

ahem.

<blank>

I'm not sure I can refer you right now, so I was wondering if you could give me a discount, like a partial refund, if I refer you at a later date?"

I'm good. The amount of the refund depends on how useful the message is."

Okay, we have a deal. Now let's see the actual slave. I'm fine with a missing arm. Preferably one arm, but if you want, both arms can be missing.

What about?" ......I see."

<blank>

If you have a missing foot, you won't be able to pick up a sock even if I heal you.

<blank>

"If you're at ......, there's one who's just right. He is a former minstrel who lost both arms, his beauty and his voice. The price is only one gold coin. Do you really think you can fix him?"

<blank>

Oops, here comes a very suitable one.

What is this, God wants that kid's socks?

I get it. You just have to fix it. I'll take care of it.
