# It's a perfect pico-pico hammer.

The "Breaking Wall Hammer.

It was displayed on a chain in the central exhibition room of the museum, in the most prominent place in the sunlight.

<blank>

A huge, golden, two-handed hammer. The base is made of wood, and metal that appears to be orichalcone decorates the hammer like armor.

The tip of the head is carved in relief with a jagged, bellows-like shape.

<blank>

<blank>

-to put it bluntly, it was a pico-pico hammer made cool and luxurious.

Meechan lightly greeted the guards standing on either side of him, then lifted the "Breaking Wall Hammer" from its pedestal.

It is said that the chains are just to prevent people from running away with it, and that the exhibit is designed so that anyone can hold the "Breaking Wall Hammer".

...... big pico-pico hammer for little kids...... romance!

<blank>

Isn't it a curious decoration?　Oh, it's hollow inside and not as heavy as it looks. Also, the jagged edges shrink and pop, except when you hit the wall.

"...... makes sense, doesn't it?"

<blank>

It is a perfect pico-pico hammer. Thank you very much.

...... This is definitely God's taste. No doubt about it.

<blank>

By the way, how do you determine if something is fortified or not?"

According to our research, it's the user's perception. There is a legend that the first King Tessin shattered a mountain with it. He said, "The mountain is a wall to protect the ore inside! he said, and he cleared the mountains around Akahagane.

It seems that Isiah's hometown is one of them.

I mean, is that even possible? If you start saying that, anything is possible.

<blank>

Oh, it's a legend, but it's definitely true, since there are records of the full use of hypnotic and brainwashing drugs and magical tools.

'Wow, that took a lot of effort. I see."

<blank>

And so the development has been repeated, and now we are here.

<blank>

<blank>

So, this "Breaking Wall Hammer" is being targeted by the thief Hermes.

Yeah. Here's the notice."

<blank>

Mee-chan took out a card with a warning message on it.

Along with a black mask that hid his eyes and a rather cute picture, the message read, 'Three nights from now, I will receive God's treasure. The message "Hermes, the Phantom Thief" was written on it.

<blank>

It's plain and simple."

I heard it arrived yesterday, so it's actually tomorrow night."

Wow, that's not much time at all."

<blank>

Well, what am I going to do about this? I have to decide quickly.

<blank>

I think I'll just take advantage of the Hermes and sidestep the "Breaking Wall Hammer" ...... No, this is not happening. Mee would be physically fired.

Hmmm ...... I'm in trouble!

<blank>

<blank>

Dear, do you have any good ideas?"

...... In the meantime, I can think of one way to protect the "Breaking Wall Hammer."

<blank>

What? What kind of idea?

<blank>

'No, but is this ...... okay?'

'Ew, I'm curious, curious, curious. Tell me!"

Well, if we can deal with the thief Hermes, I'll have time to think things over and maybe we can solve some other things as well. I understand."

<blank>

<blank>

Next time!　Dia's brilliant idea vs. Hermes the Phantom Thief!　Duel standby!
