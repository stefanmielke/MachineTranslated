# Perfectly a Piko Piko Hammer.

<b>

"The Wall Breaking Hammer."

In the central exhibition room of the museum, it was displayed in the most prominent spot, illuminated by sunlight, and chained up.

<b>

A gigantic hammer with a golden shine, held with both hands. The base is made of wood, and a metal that seems to be orichalcum decorates the hammer like armor.

And the tip is engraved with a jagged, bellows-like relief――

<b>

<b>

――To avoid misunderstanding, it was a stylish and luxurious Piko Piko Hammer.

<b>

<b>

Mii-chan lightly greeted the guards standing on either side before lifting the "Wall Breaking Hammer" from its pedestal.

The chain was merely a theft prevention measure, and it seems that anyone could hold the "Wall Breaking Hammer" as part of the exhibition.

…A big Piko Piko Hammer for small children… I feel the romance!

<b>

"Isn't it a mysterious decoration? Oh, the inside is hollow, so it's not as heavy as it looks. Also, when not hitting a wall, the jagged part shrinks and makes a Piko sound."

"…I see?"

<b>

Perfectly a Piko Piko Hammer. Thank you very much.

…This is definitely a god's hobby. No doubt about it.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, how is it determined whether it's a wall or not?"

"According to our research, it's based on the user's perception. There's a legend that the first King Tesshin broke a mountain with this. He said, 'The mountain is a wall protecting the minerals inside!' and developed the mountains around Akahagane."

<b>

It seems that Aisia's hometown is one of those places.

Is that even allowed? If you start saying that, anything goes.

<b>

"Oh, even though it's a legend, there are records of using hypnosis, brainwashing drugs, and magical tools, so it's definitely a fact."

"Wow, that must have taken quite an effort. I see."

<b>

And so, after repeated developments, we have arrived at the present.

<b>

<b>

"So, this 'Wall Breaking Hammer' is being targeted by the thief Hermes."

"Yeah. This is the notice."

<b>

Then, Mii-chan casually took out the notice card.

Along with a black mask that hides the eyes and a somewhat cute illustration, the message read, "Three nights from now, I will take the divine treasure. Thief Hermes."

<b>

"It's straightforward and simple."

"It seems it arrived yesterday, so it's actually tomorrow night."

"Wow, there's hardly any time left."

<b>

Now, what should I do about this? I need to decide quickly.

<b>

Should I ride on Hermes's coattails and snatch the "Wall Breaking Hammer"… No, that's not an option. Mii-chan would physically get fired.

Hmm… I'm in trouble!!

<b>

<b>

"Dear-kun, do you have any good ideas?"

"…For now, I thought of one way to protect the 'Wall Breaking Hammer.'"

<b>

Huh? What kind of idea?

<b>

"Well, but is this… okay?"

"Eh, I'm curious. Tell me!"

"Well, if we can somehow deal with the thief Hermes, we might have time to think it over and possibly resolve other issues as well. Understood."

<b>

<b>

Next time! Dear-kun's brilliant idea VS Thief Hermes! Duel standby!
