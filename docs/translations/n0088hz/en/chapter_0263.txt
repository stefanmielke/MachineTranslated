# Is it like I'm clinging to straws?

<b>

<b>

"If you lay a hand on us, the Empire won't stay silent!"

"That's right! If you release us right now, we'll forgive you, so please let us go!"

<b>

Oh? The merchants are saying something.

They're being held by the gal-dragon, yet they're so confident... No, from a merchant's perspective, it seems like they're thinking, "If it's a 'human,' negotiations can work," and they're clinging to straws, huh?

Then let's correct that first.

<b>

"Well, it seems you've misunderstood something, so let me clarify. These dragons aren't listening to us at all."

"Huh?"

"What?"

"Eh? Didn't Karina say to do it?"

"Shh! My honey, just go along with the sister here. That's the flow!"

"Ah... I see. Got it! That's right, a proud dragon wouldn't listen to a human's orders!"

<b>

Now that the dragon couple is reading the room, I continue explaining to the merchants.

<b>

"Of all things, you guys deceived dragons to abduct the ogres, right? So, we cooperated with the dragons and captured you like this. It was really helpful that you came at just the right time."

"...What?"

"So that means... um..."

"Yes. The dragons are the main ones. We're just helping out. In fact, who caught the two of you?"

<b>

When the merchants glance at the gal-dragon, she grins, showing her vicious fangs.

<b>

"You guys deceived us, huh? That's hilarious. Can I really crush you?"

<b>

The gal-dragon growls with a hint of anger.

That's the spirit! Oh, but wait on the crushing. That would be boring.

<b>

"Y-yes!! I-I’m so sorry, I'm so sorry!!"

"It was just a moment of folly!! I heard there was a story about someone obtaining a dragon's egg around here..."

"Wait. Isn't this because my darling had his egg stolen?"

"Eh, me!?"

"Oh! The dragon is very angry about that matter! Right, princess!"

"Eh? Ah, yes. She's very angry."

<b>

Priestess Dia nods vigorously.

No one but me and the dragons understands dragon language, so they can say whatever they want!

<b>

"Now, the dragons are asking for a reckoning. Do you understand, merchant?"

"Reckoning, you say?"

"In other words... you must offer your life... You can eat those mercenaries over there as much as you want! Please spare my life!"

"Those guys are my hired help! Please save my life!"

<b>

The two merchants readily offer the mercenaries as sacrifices. Wow, how disgraceful! The looks from the mercenaries are truly painful!

<b>

"Ah, ah, we don't need that. Nowadays, dragons don't seek sacrifices... Instead, they want treasures. Right, princess!"

"Yes, they are asking for treasures."

"Yay! Offer up your treasures! Ahahaha!"

"Yikes!!"

"Even if you turn me upside down, ahh, my savings!"

<b>

The gal-dragon flips the merchants upside down and shakes them. Necklaces and coins fall to the ground.

<b>

"Oh, I can use this to decorate the gal-dragon's claws."

"What!? Hey! Give me more! Come on, come on!!"

"Ahhh!!"

"I-I can't give anymore!!!"

<b>

Well, that's about all they have on hand. What I'm aiming for is, yes, all the various things they've been hoarding.

For that, I need to let the merchants go for a bit...

<b>

"What is it that you're hoarding in your nest? The dragon is asking? Is that right, princess! Then, you'll have to bring all of it here!"

"Hm? Telepathy... Ah, yes, yes. Kirigon, the sister says to sniff the merchants' scent."

"Eh... Seriously, Arthur? Ah, no, I'll do it. I'm on it, sister."

<b>

Kirishon sniffs the merchants.

<b>

"Ugh. Is this good enough?"

"Well, I've memorized the scent. You must offer all your possessions. If you hesitate, hide, or try to escape, I will chase you to the ends of the earth and crush you this time. How terrifying, right, princess!"

"Uh...!"

"Yikes..."

<b>

The merchants tremble, unable to speak.

<b>

"Hey, where's the response? Do you want to be gobbled up by the dragon right now?"

"I-I understand..."

"I will comply..."

<b>

I intimidate them into nodding, and the contract is established!

<b>

"Wow, that's ruthless, sister. But are you really going to bring it? I can't track the scent that far."

"Hey, mercenaries. I'll hire you. Keep an eye on these guys to see if they don't run away and bring the treasures, and I'll spare your lives—so says the dragon! Right, princess!"

"Yes, she says so."

<b>

Dia seems to be getting quite dismissive. Well, the mercenaries and merchants are too scared to care about the details, so it seems fine.

<b>

"I-I understand. I will listen to you. ...They've already abandoned me, so cooperating to collect the debts is just what I wanted."

"Alright. Then I'll untie you, but remember, the dragon is always watching you."

<b>

Thus, we temporarily released the merchants and mercenaries.

The merchants were re-tied by the mercenaries to prevent them from escaping, though.
