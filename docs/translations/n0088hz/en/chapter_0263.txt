# Clutching at straws, are we?

<blank>

<blank>

"Wow, if you mess with us, the empire won't stand still!"

'Yes, release me now and I will forgive you, so release me!

<blank>

Whoa?　The merchants started to say something.

You're so bullish even though Galdra has you in his grasp. ...... I wonder if this is the merchant's way of grasping at straws, thinking that he can negotiate with a "human"?

Well, let's correct that first.

<blank>

No, I think you're mistaken about one thing, so I'll tell you something. These dragons are not listening to us.

Huh?

What about?"

What?　Carina told you to do it?"

'Shhhh!　My Honey, you're going to have to go along with Miss. That's the way it goes!

'Ah ...... ah-neh. Ryo!　That's right - no proud dragon will listen to a human!"

<blank>

When the dragon couple also read the air, they continue their explanation to the merchants.

<blank>

You, of all people, tricked the dragons to kidnap the ogres," he said.　So we helped the dragons to catch you like this. It's a good thing you came at the right time.

"...... what,"

That means ...... that..."

The "So. Dragon is the main player. We're here to help. And who caught you two?"

<blank>

When the merchants glanced at Galdra, she grinned, showing her vicious fangs.

<blank>

You guys tricked us, didn't you?　Can I crush you for real?"

<blank>

Gyal Dora snarls with a little anger mixed in with her grrrrl.

Good job!　Keep it up!　Oh, wait for me to crush it. That would be boring.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

I was just making an impulse!　I heard there was a story about a dragon egg that was obtained around here a long time ago. ......

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure. This is because my darling had her eggs stolen, isn't it?"

What, me?

Oh!　Dragon-sama seems to be very angry about that too!　Hey, Princess!

Huh?"　Oh, yes. Very angry."

<blank>

Hime-miko Dia-kun nodded her head yes.

I don't understand dragon language except me and the dragons, so I can say whatever I want!

<blank>

Now, that's why the dragons need to be put to rights. Do you understand, merchant?"

"Kake, kejime, is it?"

"In other words, yes, yes, I'm asking you to give me your life ...... so I can eat as much as you mercenaries out there!　But please spare my life!"

Those are the guys I hired!　Save my life!"

<blank>

Two merchants who easily offer mercenaries as sacrifices. Wow, it's not a pretty sight!　The looks from the mercenaries are really painful!

<blank>

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Imadokoro, the dragon doesn't want any sacrifices ...... instead, he wants me to give him the treasure. Isn't that right, Princess!"

Yes, he wants you to turn over the treasure.

Give me the treasure!　Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Hiiiiiaaaa!!!!"

"Say, if you swing upside down, ah, navel-gazing!"

<blank>

Galdra turned the merchants over and shook them. Necklaces and coins fell to the ground in a flurry.

<blank>

"Oh, I think this could be used to decorate Galdra's nails."

Ma!　I'm not a fan of this!　Give me more!　Come on, come on!

Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

No more!

<blank>

Well, that's what I have on hand. I'm going for, yes, all the things I'm saving up for.

To do that, we have to send the merchants home once. ......

<blank>

'What, you're hoarding in your nest, says the dragon?　I see, Princess!　Then you'll have to bring me all of it!

'Hmm?　Reminder ...... Ah, yes, yes. Mr. Kirigon, Miss Kirigon wants you to smell the merchants."

'Ehh ...... seriously, Arthur. Oh, no, I'll do it. I'll do it, Miss.

<blank>

Kirigon smells the merchants.

<blank>

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this. Is this okay?"

He said, "I smelled something. He said, "I have learned the smell, and I want you to give me all your wealth, and if you withhold your treasure, hide, or run away, I will chase you to the ends of the earth, and this time I will crush you to pieces. Oh, that's just terrifying, Princess!

"Naturally ......"

Hii ......."

<blank>

The merchants were so shaken up that they couldn't even speak.

<blank>

"Hey, what do you say?　You want to get your ass kicked by the dragon right now?"

I know, I know. ......"

I will do as you say. ......

<blank>

Threaten them, get them to nod, and the deal is done!

<blank>

I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get it. But are you really going to bring it?　I can't follow the smell that well.

Oh, mercenaries. I'll hire you. Watch that they don't run away and bring back the treasure, and I'll spare your lives," said the dragon!　Yes, Princess!

Yes, I'm saying it, I'm saying it.

<blank>

I'm starting to feel a little thrown together, Dia-kun. Well, the mercenaries and merchants are so frightened that they don't care about the details, so it seems to be all right.

<blank>

I'll say, "Okay, okay. I'll do what you say. They've already abandoned me at ......, and I'm more than happy to help with collections."

"All right, I'll untie you now, but don't forget. I'll untie you then, but don't forget, Master Dragon is always watching you."

<blank>

Thus, we released the merchants and mercenaries for once.

The mercenaries tied the merchants up again so they wouldn't run away.
