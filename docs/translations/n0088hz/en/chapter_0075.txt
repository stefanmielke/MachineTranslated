# I see, that's terrible

<b>

"Still, what could have caused a bard to lose both arms, beauty, and voice?"

<b>

Arms for playing instruments, beauty to attract attention, and singing voice――it's the full set for a bard.

It wouldn't be strange for any bard to prioritize protecting these.

<b>

"It was a slave owned by a merchant from the Alchemy Kingdom... presumably, they spread unfavorable rumors about the trading company. She was kept alive almost as a warning."

"I see, a warning, huh. That's brutal."

<b>

Then, conversely, it seems she was broken in a crucial way.

<b>

"But if I heal such a slave, won't I become a target?"

"Rest assured. She was sold just last month, and the trading company that used her as a warning seems to have collapsed along with the Alchemy Kingdom."

<b>

It seems like she was a leftover from the previous slave trader. I see. If the trading company of the Alchemy Kingdom has collapsed, it should be fine.

<b>

<b>

Well, it was decided to see the actual person.

<b>

The merchant brings the slave. ...She seems to be able to walk. So her legs are fine, which raises my expectations at this point.

The brought slave was smaller than I expected, a girl about a head shorter than me.

<b>

Both arms were missing from the shoulders, and her face was wrapped in bandages.

She wore shabby clothes, but various old scars were visible. Oh, she even has tattoos.

<b>

"She's cuter than I thought. How old is she?"

"She's over 20. She's a half-dwarf."

<b>

A half-dwarf, so that's a thing. Interesting.

<b>

"Can I take off the bandages? ...Hmm, I see. That's terrible."

"Ugh..."

<b>

The face of Dia-kun next to me turns pale. Ah, Dia-kun doesn't have a tolerance for such scars and burns?

I got used to seeing much worse in the tutorial. Haha.

<b>

"How's her voice? If she can't speak due to psychological shock, that would be troublesome... Okay, open your mouth—. ...Ah, it feels like her throat is burned from taking a poison? Oh, I see."

<b>

Yeah. I think I can heal this. That old man revived from worse conditions and kept getting crushed, so this should be a piece of cake.

I don't know what she originally looked like, so her appearance might change.

<b>

Then it comes down to the slave's personality... no, that's irrelevant and something I shouldn't look into!

<b>

A person on the brink of death can easily put on a facade!

Even Senior Shildon healed a badly injured slave with an expensive potion, and still got his wealth stolen like a marriage scam!!

<b>

I must not forget the lessons from my predecessors!!

I must not be swayed by the slave!! Personality is completely irrelevant!!!

<b>

<b>

"Then I'll buy her. Dia-kun, lend me a gold coin."

"Uh, can you really heal her in this state?"

"Yeah, I'm sure that person can heal her!"

<b>

Yes, that legendary dark doctor, Damina Niseisha (pseudonym) can surely do it――wait a minute.

...If this girl is going to be treated by Damina (pseudonym), who is going to heal her?

<b>

Ugh, do I have to do it myself the first time? Is that how it is?

<b>

<b>

"R-Really, are you going to buy her?"

"Yeah, payment will be in cash."

<b>

I receive the gold coin from Dia-kun and pay the slave trader.

<b>

"…If I can't heal her, I'll accept a full refund."

"Oh, that's considerate. Then, please take care of the various procedures."

"Understood. Now, let's proceed with the slave contract."

<b>

With the contract magic, this girl vowed absolute obedience to me. Even without arms or the ability to speak, it's valid just by nodding her head of her own will. Contract magic is quite impressive, isn't it?

Also, it seems there's no particular need to put on a collar. Good, because it wouldn't look cool if the legendary dark doctor had a collar on.

...No, on the contrary, it might be cool in a chuunibyou way?
