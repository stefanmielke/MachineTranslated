# I see... that's terrible... holy shit.

But what would it take for a bard to lose his arms, his good looks, and his voice?"

<blank>

The skill to play an instrument, the eye-catching good looks, and the singing voice - a full set of minstrels.

None of this would be surprising if you were a bard, trying to protect them first and foremost.

<blank>

"They were slaves owned by a merchant from the Alchemy Kingdom ...... who, by the way, must have spread rumors against the Chamber of Commerce. They were kept alive almost for show."

I see...an example. I see... I see... I'm being made an example of.

<blank>

Then, on the contrary, it would have been destroyed from the most important part.

<blank>

But such a slave, if I heal him, won't he come after me?"

Don't worry. She was sold just last month, and the trading company that was making an example of her seems to have collapsed along with the Alchemy Kingdom."

<blank>

It seems to have taken over the unsold goods of the previous slaver. I see. If the trading company of the Alchemy Kingdom has also gone under, it must be okay.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, let's see the real thing, we decided.

<blank>

The merchant brings the slave. He says he is in good condition to walk ....... Then that means his legs are safe, and at this point, expectations are high.

The slave brought to me was a small girl, smaller than I had expected, about a head smaller than me.

<blank>

Both arms are missing from the shoulders, and bandages are wrapped around the face.

He wears shabby clothes, but various old scars are visible. Oh, he even has a tattoo.

<blank>

"You're prettier than I thought you'd be. How old are you?"

He's over 20. Half-dwarf."

<blank>

Half-dwarves, is that a thing? Wow.

<blank>

Can I try to take the bandage off?" ...... Hmmm. I see, it's terrible.

Ugh. ......"

<blank>

Dia, who was standing next to me, turns pale. Oh, Deere, you don't have a tolerance for this kind of scars and burns, do you?

I've gotten used to being shown much worse in tutorials. Haha.

<blank>

I wonder what your voice is like. It's a pain in the ass if it's a psychogenic shock and you can't speak. ...... Yes, open your mouth-. ......Ah, you feel like you've been drugged and your throat is burning?　Ho-ho."

<blank>

Yeah, I think I can fix this. I think I can fix this. The old man was in a worse state and had to be resurrected and grinded to a pulp repeatedly, so there's plenty of time to spare.

I don't know their original appearance or anything, so their appearance might change.

<blank>

Then the rest was the character of the slave himself ...... No, that was not the point and should not be looked at!

<blank>

Personality can be mended as much as one is willing to die for!

Even senior Shirdon healed a badly wounded slave with expensive potions, and still he was robbed of his property like a marriage scam!

<blank>

We must not forget the lessons of our predecessors, me!

Do not be bonded to slaves!　Character is once again a non-issue!

<blank>

<blank>

I'll buy it. Dia, lend me a gold coin.

"Yeah, can you fix it, from this state?"

Oh, I bet she can fix it!"

<blank>

Yes, that legendary black doctor, Damina Nisseisha, would - wait a minute.

...... If we let this girl play Damina (temporarily), who should be the one who healed her?

<blank>

Ugh, I have to do the first one myself? I see.

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, are you sure you want to buy it?"

Yeah, cash on delivery.

<blank>

Receive gold from Mr. Deere and pay the slaver.

<blank>

If we can't fix it at ......, we'll accept a full refund as is."

Oh, you're so conscientious. Well, let's take care of all the formalities.

I will sign the slave contract. Then I will execute the slave contract.

<blank>

By contractual magic, this child was to swear absolute obedience to me. Even if he doesn't have both arms and can't speak, he can still be effective just by nodding his head of his own volition. Contract magic, isn't that pretty amazing?

And, it is not necessary to put a collar on him. Good, because it would not be cool if the legendary black market doctor wore a collar.

...... Or, on the other hand, was it a bit too chuunibi-like?
