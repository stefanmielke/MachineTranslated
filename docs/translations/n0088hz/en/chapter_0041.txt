# Golems are indeed romantic

<b>

<b>

I am Karina-chan. A girl destined to be loved by the gods and to collect girls' socks...

<b>

By the way, the catalog said that the reward items from the gods are 'non-reproducible.' In other words, if I want to use the menstrual skip medicine every month, I have to buy it every month...

<b>

But I won't be defeated by my period!

<b>

Saving money is earning money!

I just have to endure menstrual pain for 50 SP each month!

Just by doing that, it's like I'm earning 50 SP every month, so I can endure it, Karina-chan!

<b>

"By the way, when does menstruation usually come? Just between us, I haven't even been alive for a month yet."

"Huh? Well, um, it starts with an increase in discharge..."

"??? There are a lot of technical terms I didn't learn in health class..."

"Do I have to start from the terminology? Well, um..."

<b>

Hmm, I see.

<b>

<b>

<b>

...Hmm, I felt like my body was heavy, but I never thought that was a sign of my period.

I thought it was just my chest feeling heavy, so I used spatial magic to lighten it a bit—just between us. Take care of your Cooper's ligaments.

<b>

"Thank you, that was informative."

"Well, it's been quite a while since I actually had my period, so I only vaguely remember. It's good to avoid getting your stomach cold."

"Should I buy or make a belly band?"

<b>

Also, it might be a good idea to warm stones and make a heat pack.

<b>

...Anyway, I guess I have to experience menstruation at least once. It's scary, but all the women in the world go through it, and it's not like you die from it. It's scary, though!

<b>

If it really seems impossible, I'll go for the skip medicine! Sniff!

<b>

Since I was there, I offered some food I bought from a stall to the gods, but this time I returned to town without meeting the gods since there was no delivery of socks.

<b>

That said, I didn't have a particular destination. Since I was disguising my exit, I couldn't show my face at the Merchant Guild or the Adventurer Guild, and staying at an inn was also difficult. Well, I would just sleep in my storage space anyway.

<b>

I thought I might just wander around until evening, and while walking near the port, I discovered something very interesting.

<b>

"…What is that?"

<b>

A bipedal mass of rock, twice the size of a human. It was skillfully lifting and carrying wooden boxes.

Its gray stone limbs gave it an appearance reminiscent of an armored knight, exuding a stylishness that could even be described as robotic. It looked really cool.

<b>

I couldn't help but grab a passing man and ask.

<b>

"Hey, hey! What is that!?"

"Huh? Oh, that's a golem. What, miss, is this your first time seeing a golem?"

"A golem! That's it! Wow!"

<b>

Now that I think about it, it definitely deserves to be called a golem.

If that chest armor were to open up, it might even have a cockpit inside.

<b>

"Ah! Is it like taming a monster?"

"No, no, no. Young lady, that's not a monster. That's a large magical tool golem created through alchemy."

"Seriously!?"

<b>

Now that I think about it, they said there were golems at the magical tool shop where I bought the massager.

I only remembered the massager. Hehe!

<b>

"If that's a magical tool... does that mean you can get inside and control it!?"

"Of course. And that type of golem has semi-automatic control, so it can operate without a pilot. It's definitely safer than taming. It follows commands and won't run away. It's definitely suited for heavy labor. However, the cost of the magic stones is exorbitant, so it's difficult to operate unless you're a large trading company."

<b>

Hmm, I see. The cost of magic stones, huh.

So, in other words, golems are like heavy machinery. In fact, when I looked at it for a bit, it seemed to be doing work similar to cranes or forklifts unloading cargo from large ships.

If a person is inside, they can perform fine control, and with just commands, it can drive itself... that sounds nice.

<b>

"I want one of those. It's so cool."

"Oh, you have a good eye. That's a golem from the Gomestie Trading Company, developed by the alchemist Swantia. How about it, miss? Would you like to have tea and discuss golems in detail with me?"

"Hmm... Are you knowledgeable about golems?"

"I'm a bit of a fanatic."

<b>

What should I do? It's a somewhat tempting invitation. I don't really have a reason to decline.

...Maybe tea would be nice?

<b>

"Sure, I'd like to hear about golems."

"Great! I have a recommended place—"

"Wait a minute, buddy. That girl has a prior engagement."

<b>

Huh? Turning to that voice, I saw a group of men who looked like pirate lackeys, wearing bandanas and striped shirts.

<b>

"Yikes! G-Gomestie Trading Company... s-sorry. I just remembered I have something to do, so I'll be going."

"Wait!?"

<b>

The passing golem enthusiast ran away!

...He escaped.

<b>

"Who are you guys? Do you need something from me?"

"Ah, we've been looking for you, miss. Our captain wants to see you, come with us."

"The captain? ...Ah, Gomestie. Now that I think about it, the name of the pirate who lost to me in that drinking contest was something like Gomestie."

"Drop the 'something,' it's Captain Gomestie!"

<b>

Was it? Well, whatever. It's close enough.
