# Golem is still romantic

<blank>

<blank>

I, Karina, am a girl. A woman loved by God and destined to collect girls' socks. ......

<blank>

By the way, I read in the catalog that God's prize items are "non-replicable". That means you have to buy the period-skipping pills every month if you want to use them every month. ......

<blank>

But I am not defeated by my period!

<blank>

To save money is to make money!

All you have to do is endure menstrual pain for 50 sp. every month!

That alone is practically as good as earning 50 SP every month, so bear with it, Karina!

<blank>

By the way, when and how does your period come?　Between you and me, it's been only a month since I was born.

Huh?"　Hmmm... yes. ...... uhm... ...... more oily stuff... ......"

?　That's a lot of jargon I didn't learn in health class. ......"

Do I have to start teaching you the terms? Let's see... ......"

<blank>

Hmmm. I see.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

...... Hmmm, I was feeling kind of heavy, but I didn't realize that this was also a sign of menstruation.

Between you and me, I thought my chest was just heavy, so I used spatial magic to lighten it up a bit. Work on your Cooper's ligament.

<blank>

Thank you, I learned a lot."

I don't know how long it's been since I actually had my period. It's a good idea to keep your stomach cool.

Should I buy or make a belly band?"

<blank>

Also, it might be a good idea to heat up a stone and make a warmer.

<blank>

...... Anyway, you'll just have to experience it once about menstruation. It's scary though. Every woman in the world goes through it, and it's something that doesn't usually kill you. It's scary!

<blank>

If it looks like I can't do it, I'll use skip medicine!　Gush!

<blank>

<blank>

Since I had gone to the trouble, I offered the god some rice I had bought from a food stall, but this time I did not deliver any socks, so I returned to the town without seeing the god.

<blank>

But I don't have a particular destination in mind. Since I'm faking my exit, I can't show up at the merchants' guild or the adventurers' guild, and it's difficult to stay at an inn if I want to. Well, I'm going to sleep in my own house and storage space anyway.

<blank>

I was walking along the streets near the harbor, thinking that I would just wander around until the evening, when I found something very interesting.

<blank>

......What's that?"

<blank>

It was a collection of bipedal rocks, at least two times larger than a human being. The humanoid figure was dexterously lifting and carrying a crate.

The figure with gray stone limbs looks somewhat like an armored knight, and it exudes a stylishness that might be described as robotic. It is very cool.

<blank>

I unexpectedly grabbed a man who was passing by there and asked him.

<blank>

"Hey, wait a minute!　What is that thing?

Huh?"　Oh, uh, that's a golem. What sister, you've never seen a golem before?"

The Golem!　That one!　Heh!"

<blank>

If you ask me, it definitely deserves to be called a golem.

If you open up that chest armor quickly, it could be a cockpit.

<blank>

Oh, like, "Oh, you mean like, 'Tame the monsters'?　Like, "Oh, you mean, like, "Tame the monster"?"

'Tsk tsk tsk. It's not a monster, young lady. That's a golem, a large magical tool made with alchemy."

Seriously?

<blank>

Oh, I remember the magic store where I bought the massager said they had a golem.

All I remembered was the massager. Hehe!

<blank>

If it's a magical tool, then ...... maybe you can get in and move it!"

It's a golem," he said. And that type of golem can be run unmanned because it is semi-automatically controlled. Oh, it's definitely safer than a Taim. It listens and does what it's told, and it doesn't run away. They are definitely suited for heavy-duty work. However, the cost of the magic stone is very high, so it would be difficult to operate it unless you are a big businessman.

<blank>

Mmmm, I see. The cost of the magic stone, huh?

I see what you mean. Golem is like a heavy machine. In fact, looking at it for a moment, its job seems to be loading and unloading from a large ship, like a crane or forklift.

If there is a person inside, it can have fine control, and if it is just a command, it can drive automatically or ...... would be nice.

<blank>

I love it. It's so cool."

You have a good eye," he said. That's the Golem of the Gomesti Trading Company, the latest model developed by the alchemist Swantia. How about a cup of tea and a chat with me to learn more about the golem?

Hmmm." ...... brother, are you familiar with Golem?"

I'm a bit of a geek."

<blank>

What should I do? It's a bit of a tempting invitation. I don't have much reason to refuse.

Is ...... at least good for tea?

<blank>

'Okay, I'd like to hear about the Golem.'

I'm here!　I recommend--"

"Wait a minute, brother. That young lady has a prior engagement."

<blank>

Hmm?　I turned around at the sound of their voices to find a group of men wearing bandanas and horizontally striped shirts, who looked like pirates in the third rank.

<blank>

"Hi, I'm at the Gomesti Chamber of Commerce ......, excuse me. I just remembered something I had to do."

A-hwa!

<blank>

A passing golem enthusiast ran away!

...... got away.

<blank>

Who are you? You wanted to see me?"

"Oh, I've been looking for you, girl. Our captain wants to see you. Come on."

Captain?" ...... ah, Gomesti. Well, the pirate who lost to me in that drinking contest was named Gomesti something."

"I don't want any of that, it's Captain Gomez!"

<blank>

Did I say that?　Well, that's okay. It's almost right.
