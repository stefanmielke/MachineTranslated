# Are you ready to deliver the socks?

<b>

<b>

Have you finished peeing? Have you prayed to the gods? Are you ready to deliver the socks?

So, here we go with the delivery. When called into the divine space, the god was excitedly waiting.

<b>

“Excited! Excited!”

“I’ve never seen someone say that out loud before?”

<b>

Since it seems like they can’t wait, I’ll just go ahead and deliver them. I take out Misha’s freshly removed striped knee socks and toss them to the god.

<b>

“Here you go, please accept them!”

“Woof!”

<b>

The god caught them mid-air. With their mouth.

<b>

“I’m just asking, but are you a dog?”

“Geez! If I weren’t a dog person, I’d be sentenced to three days of exchanging brains with a dog for blasphemy!”

“What’s that, scary!”

<b>

Exchanging brains with a random stray dog and living like that for three days? That’s pretty messed up, god.

<b>

“It’s a wonderful punishment where you can enjoy both Karina-chan who’s like a stray dog and Karina-chan who’s been turned into a stray dog at the same time, right?”

“I’m sorry, I was wrong!”

“It’s fine, we’re on good terms, aren’t we? …But I love you, so I want to tease you; that kind of feeling exists, right? I feel the same way!”

<b>

Yikes. I’m sorry.

<b>

“Well then, let’s have a quick taste test… ahh.”

<b>

As usual, the god doesn’t hesitate to take a bite of Misha’s socks.

<b>

“...Mmm! This is just like gratin! The positive humiliation of wanting to kill this one is like a rich white sauce! The flavor, thoroughly entwined with the light-headed, muscle-brained thoughts of Misha-chan, is irresistible!”

“Huh? Does that mean I’m going to get killed?”

“Well, if you provoke someone like that in front of the public, it’s only natural, right? But it’s so delicious that the god will praise it!!”

<b>

Yay, I got praised by the god. …So, does that mean I might get killed by Misha after this?

Being targeted with positive killing intent by a muscle-brain means that, right?

<b>

“Even so, if it’s Karina-chan, you won’t lose to Misha-chan, right? If that happens, you can spank her and get more socks!”

“Uh, yeah.”

“Or you could just capture her and keep her at your base. Misha-chan is cute, and if she attacked, it would practically be a crime slave! The god would allow it!”

<b>

If the god permits it, does that mean anything goes…? I wonder if everything is allowed if the god allows it; isn’t that practically a holy war?

<b>

“So, what’s the appraisal value?”

“Well, let’s see. I wore them all morning while participating in the tournament, and with great enthusiasm, I made it to the semifinals. The spirit of a lion going all out to hunt a seemingly weak woman in front of me ended up backfiring. No way! This must be some mistake!? And those stupid socks…! The humiliation was very good, and the sense of shame was incredibly delicious. No doubt about it! …So, 80 SP!”

“Oh wow!”

<b>

That’s quite a high score. Thank you, Misha; if I had worn them longer, I might have hit 100 points.

The remaining balance is 1330 SP.

<b>

“Ah, here’s an extra 1000 gold coins.”

“Thanks a lot!”

<b>

I received a heavy bag of gold coins from the god. In fact, it was too heavy to carry, so I just stored it away.

Hehe, I got SP and earned gold coins. A perfectly successful outcome!

<b>

Moreover, we shouldn’t question where these gold coins came from! Since the god has permitted it, it’s fine, right!!
