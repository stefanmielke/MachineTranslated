# You've got to put your foot in your mouth. Hey!

<blank>

Here we are, the Adventurers' Guild.

It is the figure of Mr. Healer, a wizard who wears thick clothes and is suspicious in many ways. It is easy to prepare him without asking Isiah to do so, as all he has to do is to put on heavy clothes and hide his face.

<blank>

I'm sure the doorkeepers and gatekeepers saw you yesterday, right?　What's the point of hiding yourself now?"

Ah."

<blank>

You are a genius, Mashiro-san, to notice that.

<blank>

"Oi, what was that 'ah' you just said?"

No, yesterday's appearance was just a magical disguise, and this is the true form of the Great Wizard."

You're too weird.

You've got to be on speaking terms with me. "You'll have to talk me out of it," he said!　If she's just a pretty girl, I'll get my ass handed to me."

'Well, okay, but ...... is there such a thing as magic in disguise?'

<blank>

Hmmm. It would certainly be a bit tricky if they were asked to transform into other forms and show us.

I think I could at least change my ...... hair color or something.

<blank>

Excuse me, Mr. Masiello.

Hm?"　What the--whoops!"

<blank>

When I deployed spatial magic, Masiro's hair changed color from silver-white to jet-black.

Okay, that's a success.

<blank>

What the hell?

It's magic in disguise. How's that?"

Don't suddenly cast a strange spell on me!　I wonder if he's coming back.

<blank>

Well, it just blocks the reflection of light. I didn't put it on myself because it's easier to blacken the color ...... but it was pretty hard to keep deploying magic against all the hair on my body, so I quickly deactivated the magic.

<blank>

"Oh, I'm back."

All right, we're all set!　Let's go, to the guild!"

<blank>

I said, changing my voice to Mr. Healer's croaky voice.

<blank>

"Wow, you can change your voice like that?

<blank>

You should have been a little more surprised by ......, okay?　You changed it all of a sudden.

What, you'd be more surprised if I could change the color of my body hair?　I see that too.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, so I followed Mr. Masilo into the guild. I think this is the fourth time I've visited there, since I've already visited several times when I delivered a package and when I bought the results of a dungeon.

<blank>

Naturally, Mr. Masiello went to the counter without hesitation and whispered to the receptionist, "It's about the case, let's go to the back. The receptionist's face turned bright red and she nodded. Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean. Mashiro-san's voice is so cool and comfortable. ......

<blank>

While our eyes were drawn to the obviously suspicious appearance of the healer, Mr. Masiro and the receptionist slowly followed him like a big shot into the back of the guild. We were led into the reception room.

After a short wait in the reception room, a man appeared, a heavy-set, scarred man with red hair and a beard like a lion's mane. He had red hair and a beard like a lion's mane, but he seemed to be human. He is the adventurers' guild master of Carcassa.

<blank>

"Silver," he said, "is that the great magician Karina? Is that the Karina you know, the great wizard?"

"Oh, I heard that the name Karina, which I told you yesterday, was a disguised alias. The name Karina, which I mentioned yesterday, is a pseudonym for a disguise."

I was using the name and appearance of my friend Karina yesterday. Yesterday I was using the name and appearance of my friend Carina. Sorry for the complication."

<blank>

But he is not bowing his head in an irreverent manner. How's that for a great wizard?

<blank>

'And I also apologize for not knowing the rules of the dungeon and hunting torrents. If you'll excuse me, I have something for you."

<blank>

I apologize for taking the lead. Then I put the Black Mantis scythe on the table.

We have two and we can raise one of them. This one is shattered.

<blank>

'This is ...... well, definitely a Black Mantis scythe!　Oh, no, I accept your apology. And I'm late in saying hello, but I'm Garoon, the Adventurers' Guild Master of Carcassa."

Mm-hmm. Healer."

<blank>

They shake hands firmly. Under his gloves, he is using space magic to make it look like a big manly hand. He is a healer of unspecified gender.

<blank>

Oh, you know. "Oh, well, Mister Healer, I know it's even more impolite to give you something like this. I know this is a bit rude to give you something like this, but I was wondering if you could help me out until things settle down."

Mhm. Yesterday, Mr. Masiello--" "Yes, sir. As I told Mr. Masiello, that was my intention as well.

<blank>

I hunted Trent without knowing it, and if Black Mantis or stronger demons spring up again soon, it will be my fault.

So, I'll take care of the aftercare until the situation settles down. If someone dies, I won't be able to sleep well.

<blank>

I don't even need a reward, since I am the cause of all this.

<blank>

When I said this, Garoon let out a sigh of relief.

I knew money was a cause for concern. I'm sorry, but I don't want to take money from you.
