# Let's keep our stories straight, okay?

<b>

I have arrived at the Adventurers' Guild.

Dressed warmly and looking like a suspicious magician or healer. I can easily prepare this look without asking Aisia, just by dressing warmly and hiding my face.

<b>

“...Hey, didn’t the door guard and gate guard see you yesterday? Is there any point in hiding your appearance now?”

“Ah.”

<b>

Noticing that, Masiro-san must be a genius.

<b>

“Hey, what was that ‘ah’ just now?”

“Well, yesterday’s appearance was just a disguise with magic, and this is the true form of the great magician.”

“You’re way too suspicious.”

“Let’s keep our stories straight, okay? Just being a beautiful girl would be too underestimated.”

“Well, that’s fine, but... is there even a magic for disguising?”

<b>

Hmm. It might be a bit troublesome if they asked me to transform into another appearance.

...I could probably change my hair color, though.

<b>

“Masiro-san, excuse me for a moment.”

“Hmm? What is it—Whoa!?”

<b>

As I cast spatial magic, Masiro-san's hair changed from silver to pitch black.

Alright, success.

<b>

“W-What the heck is this!”

“It’s a magic for disguising. How is it?”

“Don’t suddenly cast weird magic on me! This better revert back!”

<b>

Well, I’m just blocking the reflection of light. The reason I didn’t cast it on myself is that it’s easier to make the color black... but maintaining the magic on all of his hair was quite tough, so I quickly released the spell.

<b>

“Oh, it’s back.”

“Alright, now we’re all set! Let’s go to the guild!”

<b>

With that, I changed my voice to the raspy tone of the healer.

<b>

“Wow, you can even change your voice like that; you’re quite the performer, Karina.”

<b>

...I wish you were a bit more surprised, you know? I changed it suddenly.

What, changing the color of body hair is more surprising? That’s true, I guess.

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, following Masiro-san, I entered the guild. Having already visited a few times when delivering goods and selling dungeon loot, this should be my fourth time.

<b>

Masiro-san naturally headed straight to the counter and whispered to the receptionist, “About that matter, we’re going in.” The receptionist blushed and nodded. Yeah, I get it. Masiro-san’s voice is cool and pleasant...

<b>

While gathering attention with the obviously suspicious appearance of the healer, I followed Masiro-san and the receptionist slowly into the deeper part of the guild, being led to the reception room.

After waiting a bit in the reception room, a rugged, scarred man appeared. He had red hair and a beard like a lion’s mane, but he looked human. He is the guild master of the Calcas Adventurers’ Guild.

<b>

“Silver. Is that person the great magician Karina?”

“Yeah. The name Karina I mentioned yesterday was just a pseudonym for the disguise.”

“Hmm. Yesterday, I used my friend’s name and appearance, Karina. I apologize for the confusion.”

<b>

Even while saying that, he doesn’t bow his head, maintaining a haughty attitude. Doesn’t he look like a great magician?

<b>

“Also, I apologize for hunting the treant without knowing the dungeon’s rules. It may not be much of an apology, but please accept this.”

<b>

I took the initiative to apologize. Then, I placed a Black Mantis scythe on the table.

There are two of them, so it’s fine to give one away, right? This one is broken anyway.

<b>

“This is... without a doubt, a Black Mantis scythe! Ah, well, I’ll accept the apology. By the way, I’m Galoon, the guild master of Calcas.”

“Hmm. I’m a healer.”

<b>

We firmly shook hands. By the way, under the gloves, I used spatial magic to make my hands appear larger and more masculine. Ha ha, it’s a gender-ambiguous healer here.

<b>

“Um, healer. I feel it’s rude to accept such a thing, but could I ask for your cooperation until the situation settles down?”

“Hmm. I told Masiro-san yesterday—cough. I mean, Masiro, that I originally intended to do so.”

<b>

I unknowingly hunted the treant, and if stronger monsters like the Black Mantis appear again soon, it would be my fault.

So, I’ll make sure to provide some aftercare until the situation calms down. If someone dies because of this, I wouldn’t be able to sleep well.

<b>

“I don’t particularly need a reward; this incident is my fault after all.”

<b>

When I said that, Galoon let out a sigh of relief.

Money was indeed a source of anxiety. Sorry about that—of course, I have no intention of taking money in a match pump scenario, so please forgive me.
