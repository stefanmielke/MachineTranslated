# I can't convince you!

<blank>

Huh. Ah, I slept well. ...... what time is it?"

<blank>

I glanced outside the storage space and saw that it was morning.

It's a beautiful day. A perfect day for a raid on the lords. ...... No, if we're going to raid, would it be better if it rained?

<blank>

"Oh, sister. Good morning."

Hmm?"　Angel ......, no, Deere, is that you?"

<blank>

Oh no, it seems I accidentally made an angel into a hug pillow. ...... ha!　I didn't put away the wood crafts I made!　I'm going to shoot it into another secret storage space so that Dear won't see it, and while I'm at it, I'm going to put my shaking grimoire in there too. See you later. ......

<blank>

I'll buy you some juice next time. I'll buy you a juice next time.

"Ugh, I can't believe you said it like that and fell right to sleep after just one sip. ...... And by the way, will you let me go, please, to the, uh, bathroom. ...... Where's the bathroom...? ..."

Ah. That jar there. It's got slime in it. It's beautiful."

<blank>

Pointing to the urn, which is also a bed of scavenger slime, Deer-kun walks sputteringly to the urn and turns away, tugging at the skirt of her dress and flipping it up to put her hands on her underwear ......, not wanting to look too closely at her defecation. I'm not too good at watching you defecate, so I look away.

I've been the only one there so far, but I think I should make a private room as well. I might have people over in the future.

<blank>

Hmm?　Well, my scavenger slime wasn't unisex, was it? The dual-use ones were three times as expensive. No, but if you're cute, Dear, ...... or!

<blank>

"Nyahyah, oh, sis help me ......"

Ah. Sorry, sorry. As expected, no matter how cute Dear-kun is, he couldn't get through to the scavenger slime."

<blank>

The scavenger slime inside the jar was angrily smacking Deer's buttocks. The scavenger slime in the jar was very gentle because it put the excrement-stained part inside the jar.

...... ah, I wonder if there are dual-purpose guys in a pirate hideout or on a ship. With that thought in mind, I rescued Dia-kun with spatial magic. Fortunately, the pee didn't get caught on his clothes.

<blank>

I'll ask Mr. Deere to do that for me. I might ask Mr. Dear to do that."

Yes, I am!　Anything I can do!　What can I do?"

It's an internal investigation of the ship and the hideout!　We're going to commandeer anything we can use!"

<blank>

In other words, a burglar!　I'm going to ask you to join me, Dia!

It's called being an accomplice!　We'll have a ramp to get you inside the boat as well.

<blank>

I'll do my best to help!　I'll do my best to help!"

I'm looking forward to working with you. I'm looking forward to working with you. ...... If you think about it, there's probably better bedding and stuff than my blankets. I'm sorry Dear, didn't you smell something?"

"......, uh, well, it smelled good, didn't it?"

<blank>

I'm being careful ......!　You're not convincing even if you say it awkwardly while looking away like that!

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

<blank>

Siester. Tell me where the lord's house is.

I'm sorry to disturb you. ...... the castle you see over there..."

"The castle?　Which one?"

Do you see those ramparts?

"Ah, that fort-like thing. It's a castle. It's more square than I thought. Thanks."

<blank>

Well... So I got the information and headed to the lord's house!

<blank>

It would be nice to use God's universal passport to go in from the front, but this time I think I will sneak in from the sky. I have to find out where the elven sister is, and it would be a big problem if I use the pass every time I need to find her.

<blank>

I rested well, so I have enough magic power. No, well, I'm thinking about getting more solid bedding. Right now, I'm just wrapped up in blankets.

Dear, I would like to give you a proper sleeping environment!

<blank>

...... Hmmm?　I've been thinking about it and I'm wondering if there was more solid bedding than blankets in the pirates' hideout or on the pirate ship.　I should have scavenged before I went to bed. ...... Dear, could you please search around there?

<blank>

<blank>

Now let's see. Let's see where Mr. Elf is."

<blank>

I quickly transitioned into the lord's mansion and went indoors with optical camouflage. Oh, there are maids and such. I might as well borrow a maid's outfit and disguise myself.

<blank>

Gently listen to the servant's conversation.

...... I wonder if grilled fish will be on the menu for dinner tonight. Looks delicious!

Training menu for new recruits?　That's tough.

Stocking up on booze, huh? We have wine now, don't we?　How about it?

<blank>

Hey, have you found that elf yet?"

Sorry, we're still searching, but we have no new information as of yet. ......

<blank>

Oops!　Elf story!　It looks like a soldier and a captain. Tell me more!

<blank>

No progress. ...... Keep searching. Keep searching, but be careful not to stir things up, because you're dealing with the wrong people. And when you find them, don't attack them.

Ha!"

<blank>

And then the conversation ended and we broke up. Hmmm, I wonder. Is the lord looking for the elf?　I wonder if Dia's sister has escaped.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And so, as I explored the lord's house, I spotted a familiar face.

<blank>

That's Grandma Maria!　Ofrofrends!

I mean, she's dressed so beautifully, she looks like a noble ......, not just like a noble, but a real noble.　The woman in the side service is also an off-loaf lens.

Was Grandma Maria a great person by any chance?　And Obachan and the others, were they maidens or something like that?　I guess they came to the bathhouse as a guest. No wonder she was used to washing people.

<blank>

I guess I'll just have to go to ...... hmmm. I feel like I took a bath with him, he doesn't seem like a bad guy. It's hard to think of an elf as a pet. If this were to be followed by, "An elf?　That would make a great pet! I'd be very surprised if he said that, wouldn't I?　I don't think I would say it.

<blank>

<blank>

Okay. Let's discuss this while secretly hiding our true identities!
