# Isn't he a man with potential?

<blank>

My name is Karina. My companion is Dia. He is a very cute little boy!

We went out to eat to celebrate the possibility of seeing your sister again!

<blank>

So, he entered a suitable restaurant, tucked into the paella he ordered, enjoyed dessert, and at the checkout stage, Dia realized that he was dressed in a dress. He realized that he was wearing a one-piece dress.

<blank>

"I can't go to ...... any more pussy ......!"

You're a good woman!"

I am a man!　I'm a man ......!

<blank>

But no one noticed they were boys, rather they said, "Hey, you ladies are so cute, we're serving you!" and they even gave me a fruit platter and coconut juice for dessert. And Dia's was more than mine. Everyone around me was in a meltdown when she thanked me with a smile!　Including me!

<blank>

So I walk down the street, pulling Dia's red-faced hand. It's a walk to refresh my stomach.

<blank>

I was so careless. ...... I thought it would be something soooooo good."

You're really cute, Deere. No, Deere-chan?　Aah, I don't know which one to call you, so I'm not sure.

Gusun ......"

He said, "You're so cute, Dia, sulking!　Oh, I can see your pants."

Pssst!"

<blank>

Dia quickly pushes down her skirt and hides it.

<blank>

What's wrong?　You're like a little girl who is embarrassed that someone is about to see her underpants.

Oh, no!

Let me see them. Let me see your pants, Dia-chan?"

Don't pull on it!　Carina's sister's sex!

'Ha ha ha, because Dear, you're so cute.'

<blank>

His face is bright red and he appears to be feeling exactly shame. This is God's favorite shame accumulating in his socks!

Ok, one more push. This is also for the delivery of good quality socks ...... Sorry, Deere!

<blank>

"See, everybody's looking at you, Deere?　Because you're so cute."

"Ugh, that's because I'm dressed funny ......"

I don't think so. Now Dia-kun is a girl - an 'extraordinarily pretty' girl, no matter how one looks at her, you know?　People over there are fawning over you. They might pick up on you. See, as soon as our eyes met, she blushed and looked away, right?

Hah. ......."

<blank>

It works, it works. I mean, she really looks like a girl. I mean, she's totally a girl when she opens up, isn't she, Dear? I can't get enough of his shyness!

Ah, that's what I call a man's girl!　My female parts are getting all squeamish!

<blank>

I'm so happy to have a date with such a pretty girl. But I'm so happy to have a date with such a pretty girl.

So, you have a date? I'll escort you to your sister Karina.

What?　But Dear, you're broke right now. I have your wallet. ...... but don't worry, you're just a pretty girl now. Let your sister take care of you."

<blank>

I tapped my chest in a huff and it fluttered and shook.

<blank>

<blank>

And then one guy comes up to me.

<blank>

"Hey, do you want to have tea with me?　I'd like to talk a little."

Hmm?"　Dia-chan, look at me, I'm picking on you!　I'm trying to get you, Deere-chan!"

No, no, I think I prefer your sister.

<blank>

The eyes of those pick-up men were focused on my boobs.

Oh, well, I was a beautiful girl in my own way. I was a beautiful girl in my own way, though it's a bit hazy in front of Dia.

<blank>

No, no, no, no!　Your sister is on a date with me right now!"

<blank>

With that said, Dia-kun interrupts between me and the pick-up guy.

<blank>

Goof ...... hey pickup guy. Don't you think she's super cute?"

Huh?"　Oh, yeah. Yes, she's an awfully pretty young lady."

<blank>

Mm-hmm. You're a man with potential.

<blank>

I'm on a date with this girl today, so no, but if you call on me when you see her again, I'll at least offer you a cup of tea. If you are free, that is."

Oh, I promise. See you later!"

<blank>

With that said, the pick-up man smiled and waved his hand to go talk to his next target.

Hmmm, an aggressive guy. A style I never had in my previous life. I wish I had that kind of aggressiveness in my previous life. ...... No, I don't. Now is now.

<blank>

He just said you're a very pretty young lady!

You said, "...... No, you can't, okay?　You shouldn't go with a man like that. That sister Karina is, you know, pretty!"

What?　There?　Dear, you're prettier than me!"

<blank>

And I'm not a pretty face kind of girl either. I'm a grown woman.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'll clean myself up before I meet your sister," he said. Let's get our bodies cleaned up before we meet your sister, Dear."

"Yes, and then we need to make sure the cleaning magic is ......

Oh. Sorry, washing is forbidden. God said so. Especially socks.

...... is that right?"

<blank>

Yeah, yeah, I'll have Dear warm up those socks until the very last minute and then I'll collect them!

<blank>

So here we are at the public bathhouse!　Come on, let's go in and take a bath!"

"......, um, I'm dressed like this."

Come to the women's bath then. I don't mind, do you?"

I'll take care of it, and I know you're a man!

<blank>

I doubt it. I guess I could go with the idea if I just hide my crotch. ......

<blank>

Then, I don't have any choice but to leave you in the men's bath. I'll go to the women's bath and we'll meet up when I get out.　I'll go into the women's bath and we'll meet up when I get out.

Woo. I understand. Yeah, it's all the same once you take it off."

<blank>

I don't need to tell you that you can change your clothes in an instant by using spatial magic.

<blank>

<blank>

The public bathhouse still looks like a public bathhouse. I pay the fee for bathing and soap for two people to the attendant, who may or may not be an old man or an old woman, and may or may not be blind. I had my own tenugui (hand towel), so I only bought one for Dia.

<blank>

I'll see you later.

Yes. See you later."

<blank>

I went to the women's bath and Dia-kun went to the men's bath. Hey, old lady, how have you been the other day? Hey, did you know who Grandma Maria was?　Did you know?　Oh, tell me. I was so surprised to see you by chance.

What?　Something about skin glow better than the other day?　Well, maybe it's because I've supplied myself with plenty of nutrients that I can only get from male daughters. Ohohoho.

<blank>

Lasciviousness! No, it's a beautiful elf!

I'm a man!

<blank>

In addition, such cries could be heard or not from the men's baths.
