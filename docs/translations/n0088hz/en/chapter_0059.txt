# Isn't he a promising guy?

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. My companion is Dia-kun. He’s such a cute boy!

To celebrate the chance of reuniting with my sister, we went out to eat!

<b>

So, we entered a random restaurant, enjoyed the paella we ordered, savored the dessert, and at the time of the bill, Dia-kun noticed something. That he was wearing a dress.

<b>

“...I can’t go to the groom anymore...!”

“You can still be a bride!”

“I’m a boy! I’m... a boy...!”

<b>

But no one noticed he was a boy, and rather, they said, “You girls are so cute, here’s a complimentary dessert!” and we got a fruit platter and coconut juice. Moreover, Dia-kun got more than I did, and everyone around was smitten by his grateful smile saying, “Thank you, big brother!” Including me!

<b>

So, I’m walking down the street holding the hand of blushing Dia-kun. It’s a stroll to digest our meal.

<b>

“I was careless... I thought it felt breezy.”

“You're really cute, Dia-kun. Or should I call you Dia-chan? Ah, I’m confused about which to use!”

“Sniff...”

“The sulking Dia-kun is cute too! Oh, I can see your panties.”

“Ah!”

<b>

Dia-kun quickly holds down his skirt to hide it.

<b>

“Hehe, what’s wrong? Getting embarrassed because someone might see your panties? You’re acting like a girl.”

“N-no, that’s not true!”

“Then show me. Can you show me your panties, Dia-chan?”

“N-no, don’t pull! That’s naughty, Karina-onee-san!”

“Hahaha, but Dia-kun is just too cute!”

<b>

His face is bright red, clearly feeling embarrassed. It seems that his socks have accumulated a divine level of embarrassment!

Alright, let’s push a little further. This is all for delivering quality socks... Sorry, Dia-kun!

<b>

“Look, everyone is looking at you, Dia-kun. It’s because you’re cute.”

“Ugh, it’s because I’m dressed weirdly...”

“That’s not true. Right now, Dia-kun is, no matter how you look at it, a girl—no, a ‘super cute’ girl, okay? That person over there is captivated by you. You might get hit on. See, the moment your eyes met, he turned red and looked away, right?”

“Ugh...”

<b>

It’s working, it’s working. I mean, he really looks like a girl. If he embraces it, he’s completely a girl now, Dia-kun. His embarrassed demeanor that can’t embrace it is just irresistible!

Ah, this is what a boy in a dress is! My feminine side is fluttering!

<b>

“Hehe. Still, I’m so happy to be on a date with such a cute kid.”

“So, for the date, I’ll escort you, Karina-onee-san!”

“Eh? But Dia-kun, you’re broke right now. I have the wallet... But it’s okay, right now, Dia-kun is just a cute girl. Leave it to your onee-san!”

<b>

With a triumphant thump on my chest, it jiggled.

<b>

<b>

Then, a guy approached us.

<b>

“Hey, would you like to have some tea? I’d like to chat for a bit.”

“Hmm? Dia-chan, look, you’re being hit on! He’s aiming for you!”

“Eh, no, I actually prefer your sister...”

<b>

The pick-up guy’s gaze was directed at my breasts.

Ah, I guess I’m also somewhat of a beautiful girl. I may fade in comparison to Dia-kun, though.

<b>

“N-no! Onee-san is on a date with me right now!”

<b>

Saying that, Dia-kun interjected between me and the pick-up guy.

<b>

“Guh... Hey, pick-up guy. Don’t you think this kid is super cute?”

“Eh? Ah, yeah. She’s really a cute young lady.”

<b>

Hmm. He seems like a promising guy.

<b>

“Today, I can’t because I’m on a date with her, but if we meet again, just call out to me and I’ll at least have tea with you. Only if I’m free, though.”

“Okay, it’s a promise. See you later!”

<b>

Saying that, the pick-up guy waved goodbye with a smile and went to hit on his next target.

Hmm, he’s quite the proactive guy. A style I didn’t have in my past life. If only I had that kind of assertiveness in my past life... No, let’s not go there. This is now.

<b>

“That guy just called you a super cute young lady!”

“...That’s not good, okay? You shouldn’t follow guys like that. Because, Karina-onee-san is, um, cute!”

“Eh? Really? Dia-kun is cuter!”

<b>

And I’d say I’m more of a beauty type. A grown woman, you know?

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Right. Before meeting Dia-kun’s sister, let’s clean ourselves up.”

“Yes, then I’ll use a cleansing magic...”

“Oh. Sorry, cleansing is prohibited. The god said so. Especially for socks, they should be reused.”

“...Is that so?”

<b>

Yes, yes, those socks will be warmed up by Dia-kun until the last moment, and then I’ll collect them!

<b>

“So, it’s off to the public bath! Come on, let’s go to the bath!”

“...Um, I’m in this outfit, though.”

“Then come to the women’s bath. I don’t mind!”

“I mind, and you can clearly tell I’m a boy!!”

<b>

Is that so? If I just cover my groin, it might actually work...

<b>

“Well, since there’s no helping it, Dia-kun, you go to the men’s bath. It’s the same if you take off all your clothes to bathe, and it’s a hassle to change back, right? I’ll go to the women’s bath, and we’ll meet up after.”

“Ugh. I understand. Well, if I take it off, it’s the same anyway.”

<b>

I won’t mention that using spatial magic allows for instant changing.

<b>

<b>

As usual, it’s a public bath like a sento. I pay for two bathing fees and soap to the old man or old woman, who I can’t tell if they can see or not. I already have a towel for myself, so I only buy one for Dia-kun.

<b>

“Well then, see you later!”

“Yes, see you later.”

<b>

I head to the women’s bath, and Dia-kun goes to the men’s bath. Oh, hey there, auntie, it’s been a while. Hey, did you know Maria-baa’s true identity? You knew? Come on, tell me! I was surprised when I ran into her by chance.

What? You say my skin looks better than the last time? Hmm, maybe because I’ve been replenishing nutrients that can only be obtained from a boy in a dress. Hohoho.

<b>

“Pervert!!!” “No, it’s a beautiful elf!!!”

“I-I’m a boy!!!”

<b>

Meanwhile, from the men’s bath, such cries could be heard or not heard.
