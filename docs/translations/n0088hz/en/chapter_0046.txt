# The plan to raise male daughters is underway.

<blank>

Once that is decided, it is a quick story.

I glanced out of the spatial magic and peeked at Gomez, who was currently on his way to the land base with his minions. Let's leave it for a while longer. I'm also concerned about the "Poseidon," the sacred weapon, and we can secure it after we get to the ship.

<blank>

Now, I'm going to give you a devil's whisper - or an angel's guidance?

<blank>

Hey, Elf, I have a condition to help your sister. I have a condition to help your sister - oh, I'm not asking you to be a slave or anything crazy like that. You can do it now."

What is it?

I need you to dress up as a woman for a minute!"

<blank>

When I said this, Mr. Elf tilted his head in a kyoton.

<blank>

"...... Um, why?"

Oh, are you hungry?　Here's a scallop bake. You can eat it."

I'll take it."

<blank>

The smell of butter is enough to make you eat the scallops. He even seems to be eating the shells.

<blank>

"You ate, didn't you?　Then you'll dress up as a girl, won't you?"

<blank>

I smiled at him and he nodded awkwardly.

<blank>

'...... yes. Ugh, if you can help my sister with that, ......"

And of course, you'll be wearing all girl's underwear and socks, right?"

Why?

I want to see you looking so cute. If you were that cute, I'd put a lot of effort into helping you.

Ugh. ......"

<blank>

Okay, he's blushing. If I continue to compliment Mr. Elf on how cute he is, I'll be able to stir up the shame. Ggghh.

<blank>

I want you to pick out the prettiest outfit that suits you best from the box right there. I hope it's a proper skirt. I want to see how you coordinate!"

"Uh ......, okay, ......, what is that?　Where is this ......, no, what is it?"

<blank>

And here, Mr. Elf realized that the place where he is now is a mysterious storage space.

<blank>

Oh, I'm sorry. This is my safe house. It's a lie that the enemy is coming, I'm safe here."

"The hideout ...... eh, I mean, it's very spacious or ...... nothing?"

<blank>

In this endless storage space, there is nothing but my furniture, my luggage, the crate I just took away, and logs. There is a floor, but no ceiling or walls.

It is not within visual range at least, and it is such an endless mysterious space that I have no desire to even check it.

<blank>

In addition to this space, there is also a food storage space where he keeps the alcohol he took from Gomez and the food he bought from the street vendor, and a closet space where he keeps the original clothes he is currently wearing. You can add as many as you like.

Too cheat, maybe I'll put away some ocean water next time.

<blank>

I'm going to build a house one of these days, so don't worry about that. It's not cool to pry into a maiden's secrets, is it?"

Yes, yes, ...... I understand."

<blank>

All right, all right. I'd love to get Gomez's hideout for the whole building.

<blank>

Oh, by the way, Elf, can you tell me your name?"

Uh, ......."

Hm?"　I don't mind if you don't want to say it, you can use a fake name, just call it what you want to call it."

<blank>

I say this to Mr. Elf, who for some reason is reluctant to say anything. Perhaps you are a wakareri?　Well, it's okay, Karina doesn't care about details. Even if she's great, she's not greater than God.

<blank>

Then call me Dear."

Ok!　Dear!　You can call me your sister Karina!"

Chan ......"

I'll be back in a minute. No, just find me a change of clothes."

<blank>

Gomez outside has apparently arrived at the base. I see you've gone to the trouble of packing my stuff to be robbed. I'm sure that's some kind of evidence. That could be some kind of evidence.

<blank>

Oh!　It's gold coins!　A whole sack full, you hoarders!　I got it!

...... Well, you know, you can have 10% of it, right?

<blank>

<blank>

Well, now, it seems that Dia's sister is not at this base. Is she on the ship?　Or has she already been sold to a slaver?

<blank>

Well, you'll have to ask Gomez. We will continue to monitor!
