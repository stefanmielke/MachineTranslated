# The Boy's Daughter Training Plan, Activated

<b>

Once it's decided, the conversation moves quickly.

Glancing outside the spatial magic, I see Gomez heading towards the land base with his underlings. It looks like I can leave him alone for a while; I'm curious about the divine artifact 'Poseidon' as well, so I can secure it after I go to the ship.

<b>

Now then, I’m going to give the elf boy a devil's whisper—no, I mean, an angel's guidance!

<b>

"Hey, elf boy. I have a condition to help your sister—ah, don't worry, I'm not asking you to become a slave or anything unreasonable. It's something you can do even now."

"W-what is it?"

"I want you to cross-dress a little!!"

<b>

When I said that, the elf boy tilted his head in confusion.

<b>

"…Um, why?"

"Oh, are you hungry? Here, it's grilled scallops. You can eat it!"

"Th-thank you, I will."

<b>

Lured by the delicious smell of butter, the elf boy takes the scallop and eats it. It's only natural since he hasn't eaten for over a day. He looks like he might even eat the shell.

<b>

"You've eaten, right? Then you'll dress up as a girl for me, right?"

<b>

I smiled brightly, and the elf boy nodded awkwardly.

<b>

"…Yes. If it helps my sister…"

"Of course, I want you to wear cute underwear and socks, and everything should be properly girly, okay?"

"W-why!?"

"I just want to see the cutest you. If you look adorable, I'll be even more motivated to help your sister."

"Ugh…"

<b>

Alright, his face is turning red. If I keep praising him for being cute, I can stir up his embarrassment. Hehe.

<b>

"From that box over there, pick out the cutest outfit that suits you best, okay? It has to be a skirt! I want to see your coordination!"

"Uh… I-I understand… Wait, huh? Where is this… no, what is this place?"

<b>

At this point, the elf boy realized that the place we are in is a mysterious storage space.

<b>

"Oh, sorry. This is my hideout. The part about enemies coming was a lie; it's safe here."

"A hideout… um, it's really spacious, but… there's nothing here?"

<b>

In this endlessly expansive storage space, there are only the furniture and belongings I placed, along with the wooden box I just took, and a log. There is a floor, but there are no walls or ceiling.

At least, there’s nothing visible within the range of sight, and it’s such an endless mystery space that I don’t even feel like checking.

<b>

Moreover, there are storage spaces for the alcohol I took from Gomez and the food I bought from the stalls, as well as a closet storage space for the original clothes I'm currently wearing. I can increase them as much as I want.

It's too much of a cheat; maybe I should store some seawater next time.

<b>

"Well, I'll build a house eventually, so don't worry about that. It's rude to pry into a maiden's secrets, you know?"

"Y-yes… I understand."

<b>

Alright, it might be nice to take over Gomez's hideout as a building.

<b>

"Oh, by the way, can you tell me your name, elf boy?"

"Um…"

"Hm? If you don't want to say it, a fake name is fine; it's just for calling you."

<b>

I said this to the elf boy, who hesitated for some reason. Could it be that he has a reason? Well, whatever, I'm Karina-chan, and I don't sweat the small stuff. Even if I'm great, I’m not greater than a god.

<b>

"Then, please call me Dia."

"Okay! Dia-chan! You can call me Karina-onee-san!"

"Chan…"

"Oops, just a moment, Dia-chan. I’ll look for some clothes."

<b>

It seems Gomez has arrived at the base outside. He’s gathering the items that I’m going to steal from him. He’s even stuffing documents into bags, quite a lot. That might serve as some kind of evidence.

<b>

Oh! Gold coins! A bag full of them; has he been hoarding them? Yay!

…Is it okay if I take about ten percent?

<b>

<b>

Now then, it seems Dia-chan's sister isn't at this base. Maybe she's at the ship? Or has she already been sold to a slave trader?

<b>

Well, if I ask Gomez, I'll find out. I’ll continue to keep an eye on him!
