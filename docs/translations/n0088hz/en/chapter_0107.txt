# Hmm, Diversity Party

Even though they are called blacksmiths, they don't only make weapons and armor. Of course, knives, scissors, pots, ladles, nails, and other metal products are generally made by blacksmiths.

<b>

Since they are handmade, the prices are relatively high due to the craftsmanship, but in this Calcassad Dungeon, armor ants clad in iron skin appear, making iron products quite affordable.

In fact, the safety shoes made with iron plates that I bought to gather information about the blacksmith were reasonably priced. (They cost 25 silver coins for one pair)

<b>

As we headed toward the blacksmith workshop, Aisia called out.

<b>

"Excuse me! Is it a good time?"

"Hmm, what is it? Custom order?"

<b>

A short, red-bearded man appeared. He must be the master dwarf.

Aisia had the drink she handed over in her hand, and his gaze was directed toward it.

<b>

"Excuse me, could you call the person in charge? I'd like to tour the blacksmith's area."

"Hmm, oh, is that so? Hey, old man! We have a customer who wants to take a look."

<b>

It seems that dwarf was just a regular staff member.

<b>

"Dear-kun, I thought that person was the master."

"I thought so too."

"Eh? That kid is probably younger than Dear-sama, and he's a dwarf."

<b>

What!?

<b>

"Wait a minute, how old is that dwarf supposed to be!?"

"Um, around 15 years old, I think. Probably an apprentice."

"That definitely makes me older. I'm around 30."

<b>

What!? What a surprise. Dear-kun was legal...!?

<b>

"Elves live long, you know. In human terms, that's about 11 years old, Master."

"Oh, is that so? How about dwarves' lifespans?"

"They're not much different from humans. Women tend to look younger, though."

<b>

Aisia puffed out her chest as she said that. Hmm, she's a legal loli. The party members are all legal lolis... No, maybe Dear-kun is in a gray area? A legal gray loli.

<b>

"That said, I see. It's hard to tell age when you actually see it."

"Aisia and Sati-tan are older than that one we just saw. And it seems that dwarves can tell age properly from their perspective."

<b>

From an elf's point of view, it seemed particularly impressive to see the beard. ...It does look like an old man is hitting on a child. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

Then, a white-bearded dwarf appeared. Now that's a different level of presence.

<b>

"Oh, you want to take a look? That's quite the whim."

"Nice to meet you, Master. Please accept this as a token of our acquaintance."

"Alright, as long as you don't get in the way, feel free to look around. Make sure to take care of those girls with you too."

<b>

Thanks to the dwarf's negotiation technique (alcohol bribe), Aisia happily secured the right to tour. That was quick!

<b>

"We did it, Master! They said we can also watch the forging process!"

"I’m surprised it was so easy."

"It must have been Sati's drink. The moment they saw it, they got interested."

<b>

Hehe, Aisia was proud of Sati-tan's achievement.

Meanwhile, Dear-kun was frowning.

<b>

"...Both of them had impressive beards. I wouldn't have known who the master was if it hadn't been mentioned. But Karina-onee-san figured it out."

"I see. From an elf's perspective, it's hard to grasp the dignity of dwarves. Like, the texture of the beard, the wrinkles, the gaze?"

"If you mention it, I can kind of understand... If I touched it, I could probably tell by the refinement of their mana."

"I don't understand that part. Dwarves look like a child just after adulthood and a skilled old man at a glance."

<b>

It seems that the three of us see the same things differently. Hmm, a diversity party indeed.

<b>

……

I wonder how those two perceive me? Just a little curious, but I'll keep that to myself.
