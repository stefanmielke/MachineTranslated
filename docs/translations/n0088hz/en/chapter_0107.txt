# Hmmm, diversity party

A blacksmith does not only make weapons and armor. Knives, scissors, pots, ladles, nails, and other metal products are generally made in a blacksmith shop.

<blank>

The prices are reasonably high because they are handmade with a technical fee, but iron products are reasonably inexpensive, especially in this Carcassa dungeon, where armorers wear an iron outer skin.

In fact, the armor I bought to get the blacksmith's information was a reasonable price for the safety shoes with steel plate workmanship. (Though they cost 25 silver coins a pair.)

Aisia called out to the blacksmithing workshop.

<blank>

Excuse me. May I have a word?"

Hmm, what is it?"　Custom made?"

<blank>

A small old man with a red beard and a bearded face came out. I wondered if he was the master dwarf.

Aisia has a bottle of alcohol in her hand that I gave her, and her eyes are on it.

<blank>

'Clerk, I'd like to take a tour of the forge, may I have the supervisor come in?'

I'm like, "Oh, yeah. Hey, old man. A customer wants a tour."

<blank>

and the dwarf was apparently a regular shopkeeper.

<blank>

Dear, I thought you were the master.

Me, too.

What?　She's probably younger than Master Dia, she's a dwarf."

<blank>

Ma!

<blank>

'Wait a minute, how old are you roughly now with the dwarves!

He said, "Well, I'm about 15 years old. I thought you were a blacksmith apprentice."

I'm older than you. I'm about 30."

<blank>

Ma!　Oh my god. Dear you were legit ......!

<blank>

Elves live a long time. In human terms, they are about eleven years old, Master."

'Oh, really?　How's the lifespan of a dwarf?"

They are not so different from human beings. Women tend to look younger."

<blank>

Aisia beats her chest saying so. Hmmm, she is a legal Lolita. The party members are only lawful loli. ...... No, Dear, are you a lawful loli?　Legit Lolita.

<blank>

I see. Actually, when I look at it, I can't tell how old this one is."

I'm not sure how much older Isiah and Sati are than the ones I just saw. And from a Dwarvish point of view, they seem to know their age.

<blank>

From an elf's point of view, he looked like a particularly stout beard. ...... That looks like an old man messing with a kid. Yeah.

<blank>

<blank>

And now a white-bearded dwarf appeared. He had a different dignity.

<blank>

"Oh, you want a tour?　You're a drunk."

"Nice to meet you, Oyakata-san. Please take this as a token of our acquaintance."

"All right, you can look around all you want as long as you don't get in the way. Take good care of those girls over there."

<blank>

Through Dwarf-style negotiation (booze bribery), Isiah gladly got the right to visit. She was quick to talk!

<blank>

'We did it, Master. He says you can look at the forging too!"

I was surprised at how assuring it was."

I think Satie's drinks were good. I got on board the moment I saw it."

<blank>

Aisia is proud of Sati's achievement.

Dear, on the other hand, raised his eyebrows.

<blank>

You said, "...... Both had great beards. I still wouldn't know which one was the master if you hadn't told me. So you figured it out, sister Karina."

I see. I see. From the elf's point of view, you can't really see the dignity of the dwarf. The texture of the beard, the wrinkles, the look in the eyes?

"If you ask me, I can probably tell by the refinement of the mana if you touch ...... which I can kind of understand.

I don't understand it that way. "I usually recognize a dwarf as a child just after coming of age and an old man who looks like he has a good arm.

<blank>

Apparently, each of us three see the same thing differently. Hmmm, it's a diversity party.

<blank>

......

I wonder what they think of me?　I was a little concerned, but I'll keep that between you and me.
