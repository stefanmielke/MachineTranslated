# Oh, who did you bet on? (General Beastman Perspective)

<b>

"The Terrarial Ruby Battle Tournament."

<b>

A grand tournament counted among the three major tournaments with a long-standing tradition.

Since this tournament is "open to anyone," there are many entries from abroad, making it a massive tournament with over 100 participants.

<b>

Although anyone can participate, due to the tournament's name recognition, the participants are all skilled fighters boasting impressive abilities.

Moreover, it is not uncommon for unknown competitors to overturn expectations and place highly, making it very exciting for betting as well.

<b>

--- That said. That said, indeed.

Many powerful fighters from this country are participating in this tournament, and among them are a few called the favorites to win. Almost all of them are the ones who snatch the victory.

<b>

<b>

In the coliseum where the "Terrarial Ruby Battle Tournament" is held, two beastmen are conversing in the standing area of the audience.

<b>

"Hey, who did you bet on?"

"Of course, it's our Lord Barbaros."

<b>

The white wolf beastman, Barbaros.

He is the king of the Terrarial Ruby and the strongest man in this country.

The name of the capital, Terrarial One, is derived from the howls of the white wolf tribe.

<b>

The tournament's popularity is, of course, at the top.

He is a regular champion, and the odds for Barbaros are typically around 1.2 times.

<b>

"But you know, this time, they say Lord Barbaros is just too strong, so it's turned into a tournament with handicaps, right?"

"Isn't that great! We get to see Lord Barbaros's performance while feeling the thrill, and it makes cheering for him even more exciting!"

"Still, having Lord Barbaros face 20 consecutive battles with a reverse seed is quite something."

<b>

Indeed. This time, at Barbaros's own request, the tournament has been arranged in a highly skewed manner.

Only Barbaros has a grueling schedule of 17 consecutive battles. Until his 11th match, his opponents will face him in a fatigue-free state after their first match.

For Barbaros, about ten opponents are just warm-ups; only from the 11th match does the real battle begin.

<b>

However, all of them are powerful fighters who have come to challenge this tournament.

Even the Beast King Barbaros might be worn out and could potentially be eliminated along the way, it was said.

<b>

"You think so, right? So look at the odds!"

"...... Oh! Amazing, Lord Barbaros is at 3.2 times! And he's the second favorite!"

"The first favorite is General Garou."

"General Garou, huh. Still, 2.3 times. Does that mean it's a close match?"

"Seems so."

<b>

General Garou of the black wolf tribe. He is the right-hand man of Beast King Barbaros and also his rival.

If both of them progress smoothly, they are scheduled to face each other in Barbaros's 15th match, the quarter-finals.

<b>

And it is expected that this will likely be the de facto final match.

<b>

<b>

"Well, even for Lord Barbaros, having this many consecutive battles must be tough. I'm betting on General Garou."

"Not a chance! Lord Barbaros will definitely pull through!"

"Oh? So, shall we bet? Who will win, General Garou or Lord Barbaros?"

"Sure, if I lose, I'll treat you to a drink tonight."

"Deal!"

<b>

With that, they decided on their personal bet and chuckled.

<b>

"Still, these ten guys are a bit pitiful, aren't they?"

"Yeah. They're completely just supporting characters for Lord Barbaros."

"...... Is that why?"

"What do you mean?"

<b>

Huh? He tilts his head.

<b>

"Well, you see. The odds for Lord Barbaros's opponents up to the 10th match are all low, right?"

"Ah, yeah. They're mostly around 500 to 900 times."

<b>

Betting one silver coin could yield five to nine gold coins, an outrageous multiplier. However, they are essentially sacrifices for Barbaros, which makes it somewhat understandable.

<b>

"Yet, the odds for the first match's opponent are 10 times."

"Haha. That's probably because sympathy votes piled up, right?"

"Ah, especially since it's the first match. Some of the fight money gets redistributed, right?"

<b>

They nod in agreement.

<b>

"...... To be the 8th favorite with those odds is quite impressive!"

"Absolutely. Why don't you buy a ticket too? Let's donate."

"Hmm, then I'll buy one worth a medium copper coin."

"I'll get one worth a medium copper coin too."

<b>

With that, they head off to purchase their betting tickets.

<b>

"Um, what's the name of that competitor? Karina from the Fakers? A D-rank adventurer, right? Sounds weak."

"I haven't heard of her. Well, they probably want her to win easily in the first match as a courtesy from the tournament organizers."
