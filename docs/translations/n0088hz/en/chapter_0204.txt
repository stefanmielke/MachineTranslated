# Oh, who did you bet on? (General beastman's point of view)

<blank>

The Terra Realvy Battle Tournament.

<blank>

It is a venerable, large tournament, one of the three major ones.

Because this tournament is "open to all," many entries are from outside of Japan, making it a huge tournament with over 100 participants.

<blank>

Although anyone can participate, due to the name value of the tournament, the participants are all skilled and proud of their skills.

Often, unknown players overturn the odds and win the top prizes, making it a very exciting time in the gambling world.

<blank>

- - although. Nevertheless.

This tournament, of course, is attended by many of the country's best and brightest, and there are a handful of them, some of whom are called the favorites to win. And they almost always take the championship.

The Coliseum where the "Terra Real Beastie Battle Tournament" takes place. In the standing room of the auditorium, two beastmen are talking.

<blank>

Oh, who did you bet on?"

"That would be our Barbaros."

<blank>

White wolf-beastman, Barbaros.

He is the king who rules Terra Realby and the most powerful man in the country.

The name of the capital, Teraliawan, comes from the cry of their white wolf tribe.

<blank>

The most popular of the competition is, of course, the most popular.

A regular winner, Barbaros' payout is at most 1.2x.

<blank>

"But this time, Master Barbaros is too strong, so it's like a handicap tournament, right?"

I think it's a good idea!　We can see the success of Mr. Barbaros with excitement, and we can cheer for him.

But, you know, Barbaros' place is seeded in the opposite direction, and they have to fight 20 rounds in a row.

<blank>

That's right. This year's tournament is quaintly and unduly biased, thanks to Barbaros' own offer.

Only Barbaros has a hard schedule of 17 consecutive matches. Until its 11th round, the opponent will face Barbaros with zero fatigue in the first round.

For Barbaros, about 10 players is a preparatory exercise, and it is only after the 11th round that the real work begins.

<blank>

However, all of them are talented people who have hit the ground running in this tournament.

It was said that even Barbaros, the Beast King, would be fatigued and lose the race in the process.

<blank>

You think so, don't you?　So, see, look at the odds!"

"...... Oh!　Wow, Master Barbaros is 3.2 times the favorite!　And he's the second favorite!

The favorite would be General Garrow."

General Garou? But 2.3 times as much, huh? I guess that means it's a close race."

I know you will."

<blank>

General Garou of the Black Wolf Tribe. He is the right-hand man and rival of the Beast King Barbaros.

If they both win well, they will meet in the quarterfinals, the 15th round of the Barbaros.

<blank>

And perhaps it was expected that it would be a substantial final.

<blank>

<blank>

I bet General Garou will be able to handle it. I bet on General Garou.

I'm sure Master Barbaros will do it!　Master Barbaros must be able to do it!"

"Okay, so you want to bet? Well, shall we make a bet?　Who will win, General Garou or Master Barbaros?"

"Sure. If I lose, how about I buy you a drink tonight?"

I'm in!

<blank>

And they decide to make a personal bet, too, and grin and laugh.

<blank>

But I still feel a little sorry for these 10 guys.

I'm a complete complement to Mr. Barbaros. It's a perfect complement to Barbaros."

Maybe because it's ......?"

What?"

<blank>

Hmm?　I nod my head.

<blank>

Look, the payouts for Barbaros' opponents up to the 10th round were usually low, right?"

Yeah," he said, "I'd say about 500 to 900 times. Roughly 500 to 900 times."

<blank>

It's a ridiculous multiplier: if you bet one silver coin and win, you get five to nine gold coins. But they are Barbaros' sacrifice, so to speak, and that is rather satisfying.

<blank>

And yet, only the first round pays 10 times the payout.

"Hahaha. You got a lot of sympathy votes, didn't you?"

Ah," he said. Especially since it's your first fight. I wonder if some of that goes back into the fight money."

<blank>

I'm satisfied with what I'm told.

<blank>

...... and that's why you're the 8th favorite, which is awesome in reverse!"

I'm sure you're right. Why don't you buy one too?　Let's donate some money."

'Hmmm, I'll only buy you one medium copper coin then.'

I only need one medium copper coin.

<blank>

and they go to buy betting bills.

<blank>

'Um, what player?　Karina from Fakers?　You know, D-rank adventurers, zakos."

I've never heard of this. Well, I guess the tournament organizers wanted to make it easy for us to win the first game.
