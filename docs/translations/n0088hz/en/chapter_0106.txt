# I like tea cookies and such

Under the guidance of the sister (with a fee of one pancake + honey), we arrived at the blacksmith's.

I was thinking it would be nice if I could learn some blacksmithing skills while I was at it.

<b>

When it comes to blacksmiths, I have the image of them hammering metal to create weapons and armor, but I wonder what it's really like.

<b>

"What about it, Aisia? Don't dwarves know a lot about that?"

"There are generally two main aspects. The forging part is mostly as you said, master. You put the materials in the furnace, heat them up, then hammer and knead them to shape them. It's kind of like making bread."

<b>

Oh, so you compared blacksmithing to bread-making.

<b>

"Well, both involve kneading the dough to make it uniform, and they both use a furnace, right?"

"That's true! You make a good point, Aisia."

"Hehe, because it's bread!"

<b>

There is a difference between baking and melting, though.

At this point, Dia-kun tilted his head and said, "Hmm..."

<b>

"Is it possible to actually see blacksmithing in action?"

"It might be difficult to observe the forging of weapons, but for the casting part, I think you could ask to see it. You buy alcohol from Sati, right? If the blacksmith is a dwarf, you might be able to get a little something in exchange for some alcohol."

"I see. So dwarves can be lured with alcohol."

"And in towns like this, there are usually one or two blacksmiths run by dwarves."

"I see, that's very dwarf-like!"

<b>

What a perfect theory. My Aisia is impressive.

<b>

"By the way, what would you compare casting to?"

"Hmm. Maybe cookies? There are differences between pouring into a mold and cutting out with a mold, but you can make a lot of similar things."

"I see. I really like tea cookies!"

<b>

So, we decided to quickly look for a suitable weapon shop. The plan was to check out the weapon shop, buy something there, and gather information about the dwarf blacksmith.

And while we're at it, let's get Aisia a weapon. I had her use a mithril knife in the recent dungeon, but she didn't really use it.

<b>

"I should have asked before going to the dungeon, but what kind of weapon does Aisia use?"

"Me? Um, I use a musical instrument."

<b>

Whatâ€™s that? Does she hit things with a guitar? That's rock!

<b>

"I mostly use it to create barriers with sounds that monsters dislike. Since I'm a bard, I don't really fight much."

"Oh, that's true."

"They don't sell instruments at weapon shops, and I can only use knives at best. If you could buy me a small shield and a dismantling knife, that would be great."

<b>

In that case, it might be better to make an instrument with woodworking skills rather than buying it at a weapon shop. Hmm.

<b>

"Um, Aisia. As a bard, isn't it not very good to defend with a shield? It's an important tool for your trade, and Karina-oneechan just fixed it for you."

"Oh, come on, Dia-sama. That's exactly why the master can fix it as much as he wants, so there's no problem at all. Right?"

"Ah, yeah. Well, I can fix it."

<b>

Aisia's nuance of "fixing" seems a bit off. No, let's not think about it.

<b>

"I also want a sub-weapon. I bought the mithril knife as a product, right? If I could have a weapon to use when my magic runs out..."

"I see, I see. Well, if there's something good, let's buy it. I'll use my living expenses for that, so the budget is about four gold coins."

<b>

For a basic setup, I think four gold coins is quite a budget.

However, it seems that this might not be enough for full-body armor.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, by the way, both of you! ...Make sure to protect your feet! Your feet!"

"Then let's buy sturdy boots. That sounds good."

<b>

Yeah, that sounds reasonable. Sturdy boots that are not breathable would be even more to the liking of the gods since they would get sweaty. Having just the feet in star mode all the time is also an option. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

With all that said, we went shopping at the weapon shop and gathered information about the dwarf blacksmith. Next time, we will charge into the dwarf blacksmith for an interview. Hoo hoo!
