# I like tea cookies and stuff.

Guided by the sisters (1 pancake for guidance + honey), we came to the blacksmith shop.

I wish I could learn some blacksmithing skills while I'm at it.

<blank>

When I think of a blacksmith, I have an image of a blacksmith hammering tons and tons of metal to make armaments.

<blank>

What about you, Isiah?　Don't you know much about Dwarves?"

There are two main types of forging. The forging process is similar to baking bread. Well, it is just like baking bread.

<blank>

Oh, I guess I equated blacksmithing with bread.

<blank>

Look, they both knead the dough to make it uniform, and they both use furnaces, right?"

I'm sure!　That's a good one, Isiah."

'Ehehe, only because it's bread!

<blank>

There is a difference between baking and melting and baking and hardening, though.

And here, Deere tilted his head and said, "Hmm.

<blank>

Can they actually show us what they do, like where they do the blacksmithing?"

I think it might be difficult to see the weapons you forge and stuff, but I think the other casting guy can show you if you ask." You buy alcohol from Sati, don't you?　If the blacksmith is a dwarf, I can get a little for the price of the liquor."

I see. So if you're a dwarf, you can catch it with booze."

And in a town like this, there are always one or two blacksmiths whose masters are dwarves.

I see, very Dwarf-like!"

<blank>

What a perfect theory. Our Isiah is excellent.

<blank>

By the way, what's your analogy for casting?"

Hmmm. Is it cookies?　There is a difference between pouring them into a mold and hollowing them out with a mold, but you can make a lot of the same things."

I see. I like tea cookies."

<blank>

So, we immediately decided to inquire at a suitable weapons shop. The idea was to see a weapons shop, buy something there, and get some information about dwarven blacksmiths.

And while we're at it, let's get Isiah a weapon. I had her with a mithril knife the other day in the dungeon, but I didn't really use it.

<blank>

I should have asked before we went to the dungeon, but what kind of weapon did Isiah use?"

Is it me?　Um, an instrument."

<blank>

What's that? I wonder if they hit him with a guitar. That's rock 'n' roll.

<blank>

I can only make a sound that demons don't like and put up wards. I'm a bard, so I don't have much fighting to do.

Oh, that's true."

I can only use a knife as a weapon. I hope you can buy me a small shield and a knife for dismantling."

<blank>

So would it be better to make instruments with woodworking skills or something rather than buying them from an arms dealer? Hmmm.

<blank>

'Um, Miss Isiah. 　It's an important tool of the trade, and your sister Carina healed it for you."

I don't like it, Dear Sir. There is no problem there because Aruji-sama can fix it as much as he wants. Isn't that right?"

Oh, yeah. Well, I'll fix it."

<blank>

I think there's something a little strange about the nuance of "cure" in Isiah's words. I don't think so.

<blank>

'I, too, would like a sub-weapon. You bought the mithril knife as a peddler's item, right?　If only I had some kind of weapon I could use when I run out of magic."

I see. Well, if I find a good one, I'll buy it. I'll use the money for living expenses, so my budget is about four gold coins.

<blank>

I think 4 gold coins is a pretty good budget to have for now.

However, I heard that even this may not be enough for full-body armor or the like.

<blank>

<blank>

'Oh, yes, both of you! ...... You must protect your feet!　The feet!"

Then let's buy some sturdy boots, too. Let's do that."

<blank>

Yeah, that would be a good idea. If the boots are sturdy and unbreathable, they'll be even more God-fearing because they'll be stuffy. It's also possible to have only the feet in star mode at all times. Yeah, that's a good idea.

<blank>

And so, we went shopping at the weapon shop and got some information about dwarven blacksmiths. Next time, we'll hit the dwarven blacksmiths. Whew!
