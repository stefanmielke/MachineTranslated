# Deer-kun vs. sister (full-body type bear beastman) (second half)

<blank>

A lot of people like a well-trained woman."

Is that so ......?"

I wonder if it's too early for you. Mmm-hmm."

<blank>

And from there, Dear-kun won four in a row, and the bear sister's right arm was completely unleashed. Or rather, it seems as if he deliberately lost in order to get serious.

<blank>

"Slap it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-paper!"

<blank>

The sister won, and at the same time, a stick was gently placed on Dear's head.

<blank>

"......?

"Phew, finally a win!"

<blank>

A frighteningly fast blow. If it weren't for me, I would have missed it.

He rocketed with his left hand, and right after that, his right hand was moving. And I had enough time to care for Mr. Dear.

Who are you to overpower Mr. Dear, who is dressed in a dress made by the Five Great Old Factories, or who are you, this sister? ......

<blank>

Dia removes one of the garter rings she borrowed from Misha, which was attached to her wrist. As Misha looks at it, he suddenly realizes what it is.

<blank>

I remembered Dia's opponent ......!　Mwah, I didn't know that bloody bear was competing ......!

Do you know, Misha?

Oh ...... she is a fighting whore who is a hunter as a hobby!　Her daring yet delicate technique, which she performs from her well-developed muscles, is very popular among military men. ......"

<blank>

Hmm?　Is being a hooker more your day job?

<blank>

"He fell in love with her muscles and asked her to marry him, but she refused, saying, 'I want a stronger male than I am,' and she overwhelmed him in an arm-wrestling match. ...... It seems that her first love was General Garou!"

You really know your stuff, Misha. How good are you at the combat side of things?"

He is a fighter," he says. "He beats up a wild bear with his bare hands and is ridiculed for it. His fighting style is that of a fighter.

<blank>

What's that? It's strong. Can you win, Deere?

<blank>

"You seem like a power type, but you're faster than Misha, aren't you?"

I'm fast," he said! ...... maybe ...... probably ...... probably ...... well, yeah ......"

<blank>

Misha answers without confidence.

<blank>

Dey, Dia-chan!　Do your best!　Don't let him get up there for me and beat him!

I'm just trying to cheer myself up.

You should be cheering for Deere, too!　You too, Dia-chan, cheer up!"

Go for it, Dia!"

<blank>

Dear was so focused on the rock-paper-scissors that I wasn't sure if he could hear my cheering.

<blank>

However, the other sister doesn't seem to have much interest in winning.

When he puts on his helmet in rock-paper-scissors, he is slow and accepts Deer-kun's attack on his head with a snap.

<blank>

"Oh no, I lost again!"

<blank>

Whenever he said this and removed his bracelet with a slap, some of the audience members gulped and swallowed their saliva. What kind of a person are you? Are you a fiery fighter when a powerful enemy is powered up?

<blank>

And here, the bear sister speaks to Dia-kun in a whisper.

The volume of the voice is inaudible to the audience, but it's eavesdropping with spatial magic.

<blank>

Well," he said. Now that all the bracelets are off, ...... I have five more clothes to go. In the meantime, I'm going to take some of this off too, okay?　Girl."

"......!　You mean to tell me you didn't intend to win right from the start?"

I'll give it to you if you want me to be serious about it all the way through, but it doesn't really benefit me that much. I have enough money and I want to ...... show everyone this physical beauty as soon as possible."

<blank>

Ah. I see, the type that likes exposure and participates in conventions.

Is the bracelet an impatient play on the audience?

<blank>

<blank>

So, then Deer-kun got all the garter rings on his arms, and when they were all taken off, the bear sister took them all off. Deer-kun won.

<blank>

And the audience was super excited. Mainly the beasties.

Part of the quiet seems to be foreigners who are not traveler beasts like me.

<blank>

"Hmph, I didn't think you'd surrender until you took it all off. ......!"

I don't see any difference between a full-body type bear-beastman or a normal wild bear, do you see something different in a beastman?"

What?　Can't you see her boobs?　You're too perverted to show your bottom too. ......

<blank>

All I see is fur?

After all, it seems that the beastman can see things that I cannot. No, it would be nice and fluffy if I buried my body in it. So does Mr. Masirow.
