# Dear-kun vs. Onee-san (Full Body Type Bear Beastman) (Second Half)

<b>

"Many people prefer women who are well-trained, you know."

"Is that so...?"

"Maybe it was too early for you, dear. Hehe."

<b>

From there, Dear-kun achieved four consecutive victories, and the right arm of the bear onee-san was completely freed. It seems she intentionally lost to bring out her true strength.

<b>

"Rock-paper-scissors, let's go!!"

<b>

With the onee-san's victory, a stick was gently placed on Dear-kun's head.

<b>

"...!?"

"Hehe, I finally got a win!"

<b>

An incredibly fast strike. I would have missed it if it weren't for me.

She played rock-paper-scissors with her left hand, and immediately after, her right hand moved. She even had the composure to be considerate of Dear-kun.

What kind of person is this onee-san to overwhelm Dear-kun, who is clad in a dress made by the Five Elder Workshop...!

<b>

Dear-kun, who borrowed a garter ring from Misha, removed the one he had on his wrist. Watching that, Misha suddenly realized her true identity.

<b>

"I remember who Dear-chan's opponent is! Hmm, I can't believe that blood-soaked bear is competing...!"

"You know her, Misha!?"

"Ah... that person is a hunter as a hobby, a fighting prostitute! The bold yet delicate techniques unleashed from her finely honed muscles are said to be extremely popular among soldiers..."

<b>

Hmm? Is her main profession as a prostitute?

<b>

"Even if someone falls in love with her muscles and asks for her hand, she would crush them in arm wrestling, saying, 'I want a stronger man than me'... Apparently, her first love was General Garou!"

"You're really knowledgeable, Misha. By the way, how skilled is she in combat?"

"She’s at a level where she can beat wild bears with her bare hands and is teased with, 'I can't tell which one is the monster.' Her fighting style is that of a martial artist."

<b>

What is that, so strong. Can Dear-kun win?

<b>

"She seems like a power type, but is faster than Misha, right?"

"I'm the fast one! ...Probably... most likely... well, yeah..."

<b>

Misha answered with a lack of confidence.

<b>

"D-Dear-chan! Do your best! Don't let that one get on top of you and defeat her for my sake!!!"

"Your support for yourself is hilarious."

"Shut up! You support Dear-chan too!"

"Go for it, Dear-kun!"

<b>

Dear-kun was so focused on rock-paper-scissors that I couldn't tell if he heard my cheering.

<b>

However, the onee-san didn't seem very eager to win.

When wearing the helmet in rock-paper-scissors, she took her time, accepting Dear-kun's attacks on her head.

<b>

"Ah, I lost again."

<b>

Every time she said that and removed her arm ring, some of the audience gulped. What kind of fetish is that? Is she a battle-loving warrior who gets fired up when a strong opponent powers up?

<b>

At this point, the bear onee-san whispered to Dear-kun.

Her voice was at a volume that the audience couldn't hear, but it was eavesdropped on using spatial magic.

<b>

"Well then. Now that all the arm rings are off... I still have five pieces of clothing left. In the meantime, I'll be taking some of yours off too, okay? Dear-chan."

"...! You never intended to win from the start, did you?"

"If you want me to go all out until the end, I will, but it doesn't really benefit me that much. I have enough money... I just want to show off this beautiful body to everyone quickly."

<b>

Ah. I see, she's the type who loves exposure and participates in competitions.

The arm rings are a tease for the audience, I see.

<b>

<b>

Then, after Dear-kun had all the garter rings on his arms taken off, the bear onee-san removed all her clothing. Dear-kun's victory.

<b>

And the venue erupted with excitement. Mainly from the beastmen.

Some were quiet, likely foreign travelers who were not beastmen like me.

<b>

"Heh, I never thought you wouldn't surrender until you took everything off...!"

"The full-body type bear beastman looks no different from a wild bear, but do beastmen see something different?"

"Huh? Can’t you see those breasts? And being completely exposed below is way too perverted...!"

<b>

All I see is fur??

It seems that beastmen can see things that I can't. Well, it does seem like it would feel nice to be buried in that fluffiness. Just like Mashiro-san.
