# True Chaos God Reform, Kaoru

<blank>

What am I supposed to call you, by the way?　You're not a true god of chaos, are you?"

Yeah, well, ...... you can call me Chaos, or even Kaoru."

Ok, you can call me Karina."

I understand. Nice to meet you, Karina."

<blank>

True Chaos Gods Revised, Kaoru became (temporarily) a member of the group!

In the meantime, I'm getting out of jail.

<blank>

I'll show you to the bedroom then. ...... The protection that hides you from this higher being is effective for a radius of about 10 meters, but don't go too far away."

<blank>

Kaoru then pulls out a pendant of a talisman from his chest--that little statue looks a little familiar. That little statue looks a little familiar. It's the same design as the one we have at home, Mr. Koshori.

It seems to be properly effective.

<blank>

I'm assuming a frontal assault. I'm assuming a frontal assault, do you have a plan?"

'Really, Carina's a brainiac. Oh, well, then you'll have to tie me up. I'll go with the body that caught you guys in jail, and when I agitated you, you fought back and caught me."

<blank>

The guy who says "surrender if you want to spare the life of the true god of chaos"? I hope they understand that.

<blank>

If they listen to me and surrender, fine, if they don't, then we'll just go straight to the front. If you don't, you can go straight through the front door. ...... I'll be there to back you up."

<blank>

He tied Kaoru up with the rope he was given. The rope had a neat slit in it, and it looked as if it could be torn off if I put all my strength into it.

<blank>

You can tie me up!　You do this, you do that, you ...... do this, you do that!"

Ugh." ......That's pretty tight. ......Okay, let's go."

<blank>

We headed for the bedroom, with Kaoru, who was tied behind her back by Misha, leading the way.

<blank>

The bedroom door was a sideways sliding door. It was said to open by popping the card key into the panel next to it.

However, the walls are protected against space-time magic, so I don't know what's going on inside.

<blank>

We have one enemy, don't we?"

Oh. There's only one maid homunculus watching over me. There are a few other homunculi, but they are of my own making.

Is she pretty?"

Of course, Karina. If it's all over and I'm safe, I'll make you one."

<blank>

Kaoru laughs and says, "I know what you mean, brother. I'm getting motivated.

<blank>

There's a key card in my breast pocket. Take it out and use it."

You should have let me out before you tied me up. ...... I'll rub it in while I'm at it."

'Hmmm ...... hmmm, that's not too bad either.'

<blank>

Nice tits with quite a bit of weight. And he took out his card key.

<blank>

'Okay, here we go. ...... Misha, take care of Kaoru."

I'll leave it to you!　If you betray me, I'll really cut your head off, won't I?"

"Oh, oh. This young lady's really motivated, huh?"

He said, "They're my pets. I won't do it, but if it's all over and you're safe, you can rub my ass."

<blank>

It's an ass that pleases God, after all. It's kind of rare, you know?

<blank>

Hey, Karina, you can't just decide on your own, can you?

No, I have that right, don't I?"

"......Yeah, that's what I thought. ......K!"

<blank>

Don't forget, I said. I hit the panel with my keycard key.
