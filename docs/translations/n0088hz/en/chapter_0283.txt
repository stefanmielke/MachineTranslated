# True Chaos God, now Kaoru

<b>

"By the way, what should I call you? You're not the True Chaos God, right?"

"Ah, that's right... You can call me Chaos, no, Kaoru."

"Okay, please call me Karina."

"Understood. Nice to meet you, Karina."

<b>

True Chaos God, now Kaoru has (temporarily) joined the party!

For now, let's get out of the cell.

<b>

"Alright, I'll guide you to the bedroom. ...Just so you know, this protective charm to hide from this higher being is effective within a radius of about 10 meters, but don't stray too far."

<b>

Saying that, Kaoru took out a pendant charm from his chest――that small statue looks somewhat familiar. It's the same design as the Koshori-kun we have at home.

It seems to have a proper effect.

<b>

"Right. I'm assuming a frontal assault, but do you have any strategies?"

"Seriously, Karina, are you a musclehead? Ah, then tie me up. Let's pretend I got captured after provoking you guys while you were trapped in the cell."

<b>

So, if you want to save the True Chaos God, surrender, huh? It would be fine if that works on the opponent.

<b>

"If you listen to me and surrender, that's good; if not, we can just go for a frontal assault. ...I'll provide proper support then."

<b>

With that, I tied Kaoru up with the rope handed to me. It had a sneaky cut in it, and it looked like it could tear if I pulled hard enough.

<b>

"Leave the tying to me! Like this, and like this... there!"

"Ugh! ...That's pretty tight... Alright, let's go."

<b>

With Kaoru tied behind his back by Misha in the lead, we headed towards the bedroom.

<b>

The door to the bedroom was a sliding door that opened sideways. It seemed that if you tapped the card key on the adjacent panel, it would open.

However, it seemed that there were countermeasures against space-time magic on the walls, so I couldn't tell what was inside.

<b>

"There's only one enemy, right?"

"Yeah. There's only one maid homunculus watching me. There are a few other homunculi, but those are ones I made myself."

"Are they beautiful girls?"

"Of course, Karina. Once everything is over and I'm safe, I'll make one for you."

<b>

I understand, brother, Kaoru laughed. Alright, I'm getting motivated.

<b>

"The card key is in my chest pocket. Take it out and use it."

"You should have taken it out before tying me up... I'll give it a squeeze while I'm at it."

"Mm... Hehe, this isn't so bad either."

<b>

It's quite a nice, heavy pair of breasts. With that, I took out the card key.

<b>

"Alright, let's go. ...Misha, I leave Kaoru to you."

"Leave it to me, nya! If he betrays us, I'll really cut his head off, nya?"

"O-Okay. This lady is really serious, huh?"

"She's my pet. I won't do it, but if everything ends well, you can squeeze her butt."

<b>

After all, it's a butt that pleases a god. It's a bit rare, you know?

<b>

"Hey, Karina, don't just decide that on your own, nya!?"

"Well, I have the right to do so, don't I?"

"…Now that you mention it, I guess I do... Ugh!"

<b>

Don't forget it, seriously. Alright, I'm opening it now, and I tapped the card key on the panel.
