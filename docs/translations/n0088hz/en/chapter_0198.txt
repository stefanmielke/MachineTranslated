# Let's try to get into the convention tomorrow.

<blank>

Thus, a lovely outfit was made for me.

<blank>

Honestly, I don't feel bad about dressing the pretty me.

In fact, it is even fun in the form of dressing up the avatar of a beautiful girl in a game in real life.

I suppose you could say that's because changing clothes is done in an instant with spatial magic.

<blank>

Ooh, I like the red dress too. It's open-chested and sexy!

This white dress over here is neat and clean.

Gym clothes...... what?　There is such a thing in this world......It's definitely the work of a reincarnated person.

<blank>

'But then again, why so many outfits when I told you on such short notice?'

What?　You want to look nice for the person you love, isn't that normal?"

I just want to see Kari's pretty face. I just want to see Kari's pretty face.

But this outfit is only lightly enchanted, so ...... it's almost just an outfit.

With Kari's magic, I don't need any extra enchantments!"

"Technology is defeated ......!　We can only make Kari cool and cute ......"

<blank>

Still, it comes with something simple (but by the Five Elders' standards) like MP recovery assistance.

It's a tiny amount, though, given the amount of magic I have: ......

<blank>

I've got tails, too.

Oh, thanks, Lou."

<blank>

And Lou brought another new mannequin.

I really don't know when I made this.

<blank>

"That said, there's only one dress I can wear in the show ...... that bothers me!"

I still want someone who can fight, right?"

I was wondering if you would like me to wear this underwear tonight. Underwear only, right?"

Shivaara: "Hey, Shivaara, you're wearing that kind of defenseless holey underwear!　Such defenseless hole underwear!"

She's got a lot of offensive power. It's fine if it's in your bedroom, but if you go to a convention, you're just a lascivious bitch."

I like the masculine clothes, too. ......

<blank>

You can change as much as you want. ...... Wow, is this underwear?　It's a frilly ribbon now. Are you asking me to eat me?

<blank>

I'll put that on tonight. I think I'll wear the same gothic lolita dress as ...... Deere for the competition."

<blank>

With a snap of her fingers, she puts on a white gothic lolita dress. Since Dear has silver hair and black gothic hair, black hair and white gothic hair would be a good contrast.

She gapes at her skirt and holds a pistol in each hand from a thigh holster.

No bullets were inserted.

<blank>

I'll make a holster for your backside hip. That way it's easier to take it out."

"Put your hands behind your back and give it a jerk?　Wow, that's cool too!"

'Hmph, as expected of you, Kari. You understand romance, don't you!

I'll put it on for you. I'll put it on for you.

<blank>

Ar-chan adjusted the holster in seconds and put it on my waist. Hmmm, God's work.

If you can sew at this speed, I'm convinced you'll come up with so many outfits.

<blank>

Moreover, the easy-to-remove position is perfect in one shot.

<blank>

Kari's data is stored in my body, you know. No need to take measurements?

Oh, I'm so proud of you, Ah-chan!　I love it!"

"Heh heh, me too.

<blank>

Aa-chan with a derelict smile.

<blank>

"Oh, Kari, I'm going to stab you with my knife. I'm going to stab you with my knife, so why don't you defend yourself with magic?"

Hmm?"　Strength test, huh? Yes, here you go."

Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

When he was greeted with open arms, Shih-chan charged at him with a knife at the ready.

No, it's more like a dagger. It's got a waist.

I catch Cee on my tummy, thinking, "I'm used to assaulting you, aren't I?

<blank>

The knife, of course, does not pierce a millimeter and does not damage the dress.

<blank>

I knew Kari's magic was foul!　My slitting knife can't even hit the target before the blade stands up!

I'm sorry, aren't I?　But if I let you guess, you'll get a hole in your dress.

<blank>

Hugs and strokes. Mmmm, cute.

<blank>

I'm sure it's safe to say that Shivaara's knife won't get through. But you'll have to wear my ring, right?"

'I know, Coo-chan. A substitute ring would give me peace of mind just in case!"

<blank>

Cu-chan for worrying about me. That's so kind of you!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, that's how the costumes were decided.

I think I'll join the tournament tomorrow ...... I think I'll bet myself the money deposited by Mr. Masilo and my own possessions as well to make some rough money!
