# Let's try participating in the tournament tomorrow.

<b>

Thus, a cute costume was made for me as well.

<b>

Honestly, I don't feel bad about dressing up as a cute version of myself.

In fact, it's quite fun to dress up my beautiful game avatar in real life.

This is also because changing clothes is completed in an instant with spatial magic.

<b>

Oh, the red dress is nice too. It's revealing and sexy!

This white dress over here has a sense of purity.

Gym clothes... Huh? There are even these in this world... This must be the work of a reincarnator.

<b>

"By the way, why are there so many costumes when I just suddenly mentioned it?"

"Huh? It's normal to want to dress up someone you like beautifully, right?"

"Exactly. I just want to see Kairi-chan's cute appearance."

"But this costume only has a light enchantment... it's basically just regular clothes."

"With Kairi-chan's magic, we don't need any unnecessary enchantments."

"Defeat of technology...! All we can do is make Kairi-chan look cool or cute..."

<b>

Even so, there are simple (though based on the Five Great Elders' standards) things like MP recovery assistance.

It's a tiny amount compared to my magical power...

<b>

"We also have a tailcoat."

"Oh, thank you, Ru-chan."

<b>

Then, Ru-chan brought another mannequin.

I wonder when she made all of these.

<b>

"That said, I can only wear one outfit for the main event... it's so troubling!"

"Maybe something that looks like it can fight would be good?"

"I'd like you to wear this underwear tonight. Ah, just the underwear, okay?"

"Wait, Shibara! Such a zero-defense hole underwear!?"

"The attack power is high, though. It would be fine in the bedroom, but if you wear it to the tournament, you'd just look like a pervert."

"Masculine clothes would be nice too... a handsome type that isn't found among dwarves."

<b>

I can change as much as I want. ...Wow, is this underwear? It's practically a frilly ribbon. Are you trying to eat me?

<b>

"Well, I'll wear that tonight. For the tournament outfit... I think I'll go with a matching Gothic Lolita dress with Dia-kun."

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, I donned a white Gothic Lolita dress. Since Dia-kun has silver hair and a black gothic style, a black-haired white gothic look would be a nice contrast.

I thrust my hands into the skirt and drew pistols from the thigh holsters.

The chambers are empty.

<b>

"Let's attach a holster to the lower back. That way, it's easier to draw."

"Like reaching back and going 'click'? Wow, that sounds cool too!"

"Hehe, as expected of Kairi-chan. You understand romance!"

"Stitch, stitch... and done! I'll put it on you now."

<b>

A-chan adjusted the holster in seconds and attached it to my waist. Hmm, what a divine skill.

If she can sew at this speed, it's no wonder so many costumes are being produced.

<b>

Moreover, the position for easy access is perfect right away.

<b>

"I remember Kairi-chan's body data with my body. No need for measurements?"

"Oh wow, as expected of A-chan! I love it!"

"Hehe, I love you too."

<b>

A-chan smiled sweetly.

<b>

"Oh, Kairi-chan. I'm going to stab you with my knife, so please defend with magic?"

"Huh? A strength test? Alright, go ahead."

"Take this!"

<b>

As I opened my arms to welcome her, Shi-chan charged at me with a knife.

No, it's more like a dagger. She's really putting her back into it.

I thought she was used to charging, and I caught Shi-chan in my stomach.

<b>

The knife obviously didn't pierce at all, and the dress remained unscathed.

<b>

"After all, Kairi-chan's magic is unfair! My slashing knife doesn't even hit before it can cut!"

"Ahaha, I'm sorry? But if I let you hit, it would put a hole in the dress."

<b>

I hugged her and patted her. Hmm, so cute.

<b>

"If Shibara's knife doesn't work, then I can relax. But make sure to wear my ring, okay?"

"I know, Kuu-chan. With the substitute ring, I can feel secure just in case!"

<b>

Kuu-chan worries about me. How kind!

<b>

<b>

Well then, the outfit has been decided.

Let's try participating in the tournament tomorrow... I think I'll gamble the money I received from Mashiro-san and my own funds to make a big profit!!
