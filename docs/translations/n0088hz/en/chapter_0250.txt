# This guy is a convict.

We slipped through the wards and were transported to a building that looked like the main hall of a shrine.

<blank>

"Is it safe to say that we've made it this far at ......, is that correct?"

Maybe. But if you're dealing with that Tenshiki, he must be persistent."

<blank>

While Yohki and the maid of honor talked like that, we were laid out on futons on the tatami mats.

...... Should I get up soon?

Chillax ...... Oh, I made eye contact with the lady's maid.

<blank>

...... Um, you're awake, right?"

"Hmm?　Did they know?"

Yeah, well, it was easy to transport. ......

<blank>

They say it's more difficult to carry if you're a serious sleeper. ...... It's no use if you're exposed. I sit up.

<blank>

I felt like I was drugged when I looked at them all, so I figured I should just go back to sleep."

'I am sorry, it was our fault. We would be happy to explain the situation to you at ......, Mr. Yohki."

U, ha, yes. ......

<blank>

Yoki sits upright on the tatami mats.

<blank>

In fact, there is a faction that claims that sacrificing people from the village is outrageous and that we should just kidnap people or something. ......The head of this faction is my uncle.

...... are you crazy enough to let someone like that handle your breakfast?"

I was so blatant that I thought he would do something about it. Well, it was so blatant that I thought he would do something. ...... Then, even though he is my uncle, he would be able to punish my father without mercy, wouldn't he?　If I could drain the pus out of the village with just a little scolding, that would be fine."

<blank>

Hey, this guy is a convict.

<blank>

You mean to say that the uncle drugged our princess to sacrifice her?"

"...... it will be."

OK, I get it. That's unforgivable. Let's feed it to the dragons."

<blank>

I'll certify that uncle as my enemy.

<blank>

I didn't think sleeping pills would work on Master Dragon either, though."

Well, I was trying to keep my body small, maybe that's why.

'...... I pretended to be asleep too, right? I was surprised when I was picked up by the ...... scales, though I yawned a little. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to keep this up.

<blank>

Oh, that's right. And Arthur, who is still pretending to be asleep, says in his sleep. It is a sleep talk that only I can understand because it is in dragon language.

You're doing a great job, Arthur. I was totally fooled too, you should have told me.

<blank>

In the meantime, is it safe here?"

There is a ward against men entering here. Originally, only pure maidens and the women in their service were allowed here.

Yeah, so is it safe here?"

I can't say it's completely safe because some of my uncle's clique are women."

<blank>

Right?

<blank>

I'm sure we'll protect our princess. That being said, I'd like to talk to the dragon as soon as possible, but where are the dragons?"

"...... Uh, we're in the mountains up ahead. Over there."

<blank>

Yuki points to a forest and a mountain. To begin with, this is a hidden village in the mountains. ...... Hmmm... That way.

<blank>

I see. I'll be right back.　I'll be right back."

What?　Uh, yes."

<blank>

Let's get this over with before Mr. Dear wakes up. That way, I can relax and let my uncle and the others ruin the place!

I'm going to make you regret messing around with Deere!
