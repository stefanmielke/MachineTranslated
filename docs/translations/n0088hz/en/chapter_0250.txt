# Is this guy a criminal mastermind?

<b>

Having slipped through the barrier, we were transported to a building resembling the main shrine.

<b>

"Now that we're here, can we relax... or is that too soon?"

"Maybe. But if that Tenshiki is involved, they’re likely to be persistent."

<b>

As Youki and the maid talked, we were laid down on futons on the tatami.

...Should I get up soon?

Glancing... oh, I made eye contact with the maid.

<b>

"Um, you’re awake, right?"

"Huh? Was I found out?"

"Well, you were easy to carry, so..."

<b>

If someone is genuinely asleep, they’re apparently much harder to carry... If I’ve been found out, there’s no helping it. I sit up.

<b>

"I felt like everyone was looking at me as if I had been drugged, so I thought it would be better to stay asleep."

"I apologize, it was our oversight. ...Youki-sama, I think it would be best to explain the situation."

"Uh, y-yes..."

<b>

Youki sits upright on the tatami.

<b>

"Actually, there’s a faction claiming that it’s outrageous to offer villagers as sacrifices and that they should just kidnap people instead... and their leader is my uncle."

"…Are you serious? You let someone like that handle breakfast?"

"Oh, you were listening to that too, huh? Well, it was so blatant that I thought they might do something... If that’s the case, even my father wouldn’t spare my uncle from punishment, right? If I get scolded a bit but can expel the village’s corruption, then that’s fine by me."

<b>

Hey, is this guy a criminal mastermind?

<b>

"So, that uncle of yours drugged our princess to make her a sacrifice?"

"…That seems to be the case."

"Okay, got it. That’s absolutely unforgivable. I’ll feed him to a dragon."

<b>

I’ll mark that uncle as my enemy.

<b>

"Still, I didn’t think the dragon would be affected by sleeping drugs."

"Well, it was shrunk down, so that might be why."

『…No, I was just pretending to sleep, you know? …I did yawn a bit, though… I was surprised when my scales were pulled off. But, well, that’s just a usual thing for me.』

<b>

Oh, so that’s what happened. Arthur, who is still pretending to sleep, says this in a dreamy tone. It’s in dragon language, so it only makes sense to me.

Nice one, Arthur. I was completely fooled; you should have just told me.

<b>

"Anyway, is this place safe?"

"There’s a barrier here that prevents men from entering. Originally, only pure maidens and the women who serve them can enter."

"Yeah, but does that mean it’s safe here?"

"…There are women in my uncle’s faction, so I can’t say it’s completely safe."

<b>

I figured as much.

<b>

"Well, our princess will be protected by us. That said, I want to talk to the dragon quickly, but where is the dragon?"

"…Um, it’s in the mountains ahead. Over there."

<b>

In the direction Youki points, there are forests and mountains. This place is hidden deep in the mountains, after all... Hmm, got it.

<b>

"I see, I see. Can I go take a look? I’ll be back right away."

"Eh? Ah, yes."

<b>

I should wrap this up before Dia wakes up. That way, I can leisurely bring ruin to this uncle of mine!

I’ll make him regret ever laying a hand on Dia!!
