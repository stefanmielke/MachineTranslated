Ya, everything all right?"

Oh. ...... What are you?　I've never seen you before.

<blank>

I'll open my eyes and say hello.

Pachitna: ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm a beast!　And it's a mofu-mofu type!　He's so cute!

What?　You're a beast, you're a ......, huh?　Cute, huh?

<blank>

There she was, with silvery white wolf ears, a tail, and even a muzzle (the shape of a dog's mouth and nose sticking out), a full-bodied, fluffy wolf sister. She had the dignity and charm of a silver wolf. She was probably a head taller than me.

<blank>

No, you know. I thought you were wearing mofo furry armor.

I've seen the beastman itself in Harumikazuchi-sama, but it was just ears and a tail. This one is a full-body, fluffy, chemoner's delight. Wow, amazing.

<blank>

Oops, excuse me. You introduced yourself. I'm Karina. I'm from ...... and I'm a humble wizard."

I'm Masilo. I'm Masilo the Silver White, and I'm a bit of a well-known figure in this town. ...... Oh, what?　Well, you don't mean any harm, do you ......?　Thanks for your help.

You're welcome. Oh, I hope you won't talk about me."

I said, "All right, I won't listen. You saved my life."

<blank>

With that, Masirosan glanced at the black praying mantis. Yes, it is black. And a shredded, motionless harpy ...... seems to be mithril. If all of these were mithril, there would be enough to make a sword. I wonder how much it contains.

<blank>

I can't believe ...... Black Mantis and Mithril Devil like this."

What's wrong?"

I'm not sure what's wrong with that. As far as I know, no one has ever beaten these guys.

Is this thing really that strong?

They are the punitive monsters of the dungeon. They are demons that appear when you cause major damage to the dungeon environment. You heard about them at the gate on the way here ...... that you have to seal off the lower levels and leave them there until they rampage for a week and die."

I'm sorry, I don't know.　I'm sorry, I don't know."

Did you miss it?　The doorkeeper said repeatedly that we mustn't cut down any trees beyond this point.

<blank>

Ah.

<blank>

Mr. Masiello: "Well, Mr. Masiello, what happens when you cut down a tree? What happens when you cut down a tree?"

So this guy shows up. Some idiot cut down the trees for the torrent. Trent here is harmless if you don't mess with it.

<blank>

Oddly enough, my storage space is full of torrent lumber that I hunted here the other day.

<blank>

I'm sorry. It's me."

"...... Anh?"

It's not right. What is a doorkeeper anyway?　There was no such thing on the road I came from."

What?　How is that possible, you came from a new route?

"Oh, it was blocked with beehives. ...... There was no door. ......

Tell me more about it!

Hahii ......"

<blank>

Apparently it was my fault that this sister was in a pinch.

Oh my God, I'm so sorry, Masilo. I had destroyed the beehive and came in through the path that was behind it, washed out and fessed up.

<blank>

I don't get it, but if he's good enough to defeat Black Mantis without difficulty, I have to agree with him. ......

I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?　I'll fix it for free."

I'm all right, but my equipment is a bit out of whack. I need to replenish my darts.

"Okay, I'll fix it and restock."

<blank>

Scanning the sister's equipment. Ah, the sword has spilled a lot of blades. There is also only one stick shuriken-like object that appears to be a dart. Her leather armor and boots are also covered in scratches. Well, I feel like I've caused her trouble this time, so I can't help but compensate her with spatial magic.

<blank>

How many darts do I need?"

An?"　You're not going to buy it?　Well, then I'll take about 50 bottles as an apology."

Yes.

<blank>

Pile 50 rough and duplicate darts on the ground. And while we're at it, let's correct the sword blade spills and distortions. I'll also fix metal fatigue. ...... mmm. Yes, okay.

<blank>

I'm thinking, "Where's ......?　Where did you just get that from?"

"Well, the armor is at ....... Oh, it's cut off here. I'll fix it. Sorry?"

"Oh, no, that's a scar from another time--oh, that's a scar from my armor that's gone!"

<blank>

I stroked the armor and filled the wound, and once again the sister stroked and surprised me.

It's getting a little fun. ...... No, I don't have a choice. It's a compensation for an apology!　Because I have to do my best to apologize!

<blank>

Ahh!　If you look closely, you can see a scar on my chest!　I'll fix it!"

"Hey, that's an old wound.　Whoa! What the hell is wrong with you?　The scar's gone!

I'm glad you're pleased."

"Or it ain't money!　You fixed it on your own!

I don't need it. Oh, you have a cavity, I'll fix it."

What is it?　Is it my fault?

<blank>

Oh no, I'm the one apologizing for doing something wrong. I'm sorry!

<blank>
