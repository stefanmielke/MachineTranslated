# Sorry! ●Illustration Included

"Hey, are you okay?"

"Yeah... Who are you? I've never seen your face before."

<b>

It's a bit strange to keep my eyes closed, so I'll open them and greet her.

Pachitto...

"Wow, a beastman!! And a fluffy one! So cute!!"

"Huh? Just because I'm a beastman... Wait, what? Cute?"

<b>

There stood a wolf lady with silver wolf ears, a tail, and a muzzle (the protruding shape of a dog's mouth and nose), all covered in fluff. She exuded a dignified yet adorable presence worthy of being called a silver wolf. She was probably a head taller than me.

<b>

No, I thought she was wearing a fluffy fur armor.

I've seen beastmen before, like Harumikazuchi, but she only had ears and a tail. This one is a full-on fluffy delight for furry fans. Wow, incredible.

<b>

"Oh, sorry. That was a self-introduction. I'm Karina... um, just a humble magician."

"I'm Mashiro. In this town, I'm somewhat of a known figure as the silver Mashiro... Ah, what? You don't have any ill intentions, do you...? Thanks for saving me."

"You're welcome. Oh, but I'd like you to keep my identity a secret."

"Got it, I won't ask. You're my lifesaver after all."

<b>

Saying that, Mashiro glanced at the black mantis. Yeah, it's black. And the segmented, motionless horsehair worm... apparently it's mithril. If all of this is mithril, it seems like it could be enough to forge a sword. I wonder how much it contains.

<b>

"I can't believe it... a Black Mantis and a Mithril Devil, here like this."

"Was there something wrong?"

"Not really, but as far as I know, no one has defeated these things."

"Are they that strong?"

"They're punishment monsters of the dungeon. They appear when the dungeon's environment is severely disrupted. If they rampage for a week, you have no choice but to seal off the lower levels until they die... You heard about this at the gate on your way here, right?"

"Huh? Sorry, I didn't know."

"You missed it? The gatekeeper was saying it over and over, that you can't chop down the trees past here."

<b>

Ah.

<b>

"M-Mashiro, what happens if you chop down the trees?"

"That's when this thing shows up. Some idiot chopped them down for treant wood. The treants here are harmless if you don't mess with them."

<b>

What a coincidence, I have a lot of treant wood stored in my space from hunting here the other day.

<b>

"Sorry, that was me."

"...Huh?"

"N-No, that's not it. What even is a gatekeeper?! There wasn't one on the path I took!"

"What!? There's no way! Did you come from a new route?!"

"Ah, it was blocked by a beehive... There wasn't a gate either..."

"What? Explain that in detail!!"

"Y-Yes..."

<b>

It seems that this lady was in trouble because of me.

What a mess, I'm sorry, Mashiro. I confessed that I had destroyed the beehive and came through the path behind it.

<b>

"Geez, I don't get it, but if you have the strength to easily defeat a Black Mantis, I can't help but accept that..."

"I'm really sorry. Are you hurt? I can heal you for free."

"I'm fine, but my equipment got a bit damaged. I need to restock my darts too."

"Okay, I'll fix and restock them."

<b>

I scanned the lady's equipment. Oh, her sword is quite chipped. She only has one stick shuriken, which I assume is a dart. Her leather armor and boots are also covered in scars. Well, since I caused her trouble this time, it's only fair to compensate with space magic.

<b>

"How many darts do you need?"

"Huh? Are you going to buy them for me? Well then, how about 50 as an apology?"

"Sure."

<b>

I piled up 50 replicated darts on the ground. I might as well fix the chips and bends in her sword too. I'll also fix the metal fatigue... there! All done.

<b>

"...Huh? Hey, wait, where did you pull that from?"

"Um, the armor... oh, it's torn here. I'll fix it. Sorry?"

"Eh, no, that's a different injury—wait, what? The armor's damage disappeared!?"

<b>

The lady was surprised as she stroked the spot where I had healed the armor.

I'm starting to have a bit of fun... No, it's not my fault. It's compensation for my apology! I have to do my best to apologize!

<b>

"Oh! I just noticed there's a scar on your chest too!? I'll heal that!"

"W-Wait, that's an old scar—Whoa!? W-What are you doing!? The scar disappeared!"

"I'm glad you're happy."

"I-I don't have any money! You healed it on your own!"

"Yeah, I don't need it. Oh, you have a cavity too, I'll fix that."

"W-What the heck!? Is it my fault!?"

<b>

Well, I'm the one who did something wrong and is apologizing. Sorry!
