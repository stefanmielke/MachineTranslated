# Semifinals, VS Cat Beastman Misha

<b>

"Nyah-hah-hah!! I'm so lucky! Instead of Lord Barbaros or General Garou, I get to face such a weak-looking female human!"

<b>

In front of me, who had easily defeated those two, Misha said that.

Misha is a type of beastman that is relatively close to humans, with a slightly cat-like face and just cat ears and a tail. She is dressed lightly, wearing a tube top on top and a skirt with spats on the bottom.

<b>

And she had boots and striped knee-high socks.

<b>

Striped knee-high socks!!!

<b>

"What a thing... she's wearing knee-highs!! This is... a formidable opponent!"

"Nyah-hah-hah-hah! I don't really understand, but you should be trembling in fear!"

<b>

Having made it this far, she must be reasonably strong.

But even so, it would be easy for me to win. Just to win.

<b>

...How to provoke her shame while snatching her socks...! That is the difficult question.

This is definitely the toughest opponent in this tournament, just as Aisia said!

<b>

Well, Aisia didn't mention the socks part, reasoning that "my master is kind to women..."

Also, it seems that the name Misha is quite common among cat beastmen.

<b>

"Match start!!"

"First strike wins, nyahーーーーーーーーーー！！！"

<b>

With that, Misha dashed towards me in a zigzag at an incredible speed.

Right or left, no, up, only to feign down!! I stopped Misha, who was trying to slip under my legs, by pinching her with my feet.

<b>

"Ginya!?"

"Take this, irregular Frankensteiner!!"

<b>

And while still pinching her, I jumped with Misha. Like doing aerial acrobatics, I performed a backflip in mid-air while still holding Misha with my legs. With that momentum, I slammed Misha's head into the ground.

<b>

"Pugyeh! It, it hurtsーーーーーnyahーーーーー!!!"

"Oh, as expected of someone who made it to the semifinals, you're tough."

"Ow, you can keep up with my speed, huh...!"

<b>

She managed to escape and stand up, but she looked unsteady on her feet.

An obvious chance. But I deliberately chose to watch.

<b>

"Come on, get back on your feet quickly. I'll wait for you."

"Hah, that confidence will be your downfall... Wait, why are you lifting my skirt!? Let go! Stop!"

"You're wearing spats underneath, it's fine, it won't decrease anything."

"Everyone is watching me!! My motivation is dropping!!"

<b>

She tried to punch me, so I dodged and created some distance.

And just to confirm, yes, she was indeed wearing knee-highs. It wasn't body hair disguised as knee-highs! Good job, Misha, you're my prey!

<b>

"First, I think I'll pull down those spats."

"What are you... what are you planning, nyah!?"

<b>

While holding down her skirt, she also created some distance. --What am I planning?

<b>

It's obvious, to heighten the taste of your socks with shame, of course!!

<b>

<b>

"Karina, focus on fighting seriously."

<b>

I was scolded by the referee.

<b>

"...Oh come on, if I fought seriously, it would be an instant kill, referee. So I have to do this to keep things exciting, right?"

"That's disrespectful to your opponent. If you fight unseriously again, I will call a foul."

<b>

Grr, you Misha, to have the referee on your side, what a formidable opponent...!!

Fighting seriously while humiliating her... No, that's not good!? I would definitely be judged as fighting unseriously at the stage of snatching her socks!?

<b>

"...Tch, you just got lucky, Misha. From here on, I'll fight seriously."

"Huh? You weren't serious before, nyah?"

<b>

I don't want to lose 820 gold coins just for the sake of socks!!

<b>

"God, I want you!"

<b>

God!! Please don't interrupt suddenly! This money includes Diar-kun and Mashiro-san's share, so it's not just my money, it's not okay!!

<b>

"Oh, then I'll add 820 gold coins, no, 1000 gold coins as a bonus for Misha's socks!!"

"Things have changed. I can afford to lose here...!"

"What the heck is wrong with this person? She's too emotionally unstable... Is it that time of the month?"

<b>

Misha, who can't hear God's voice, wouldn't understand.
