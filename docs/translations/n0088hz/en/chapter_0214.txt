# Semifinals, VS Misha the Cat Beastmaster

<blank>

I'm so lucky!　I'm so lucky!　I can't believe that it's not Master Barbaros or General Garou, but such a weak-looking female ningen!

<blank>

I was the one who won easily against those two," said Misha, in front of me.

Misha is a rather human-like type of beastman, with a slightly cat-like face but only cat ears and a tail. She is dressed lightly, with a tube top on top and a skirt and spats on the bottom.

<blank>

And they were boots and horizontal striped knee socks.

<blank>

It was striped kneecaps!

<blank>

"Oh my god ...... you're wearing knee socks!　This is ...... a formidable opponent!"

I don't know what's going on, but you should be afraid!　I don't know what's going on, but you should be terrified!"

<blank>

They must be strong in their own right because they have survived this far.

But it is still easy for me to win. If I only win.

<blank>

How do we take the socks away from ...... while inciting shame?　That's the conundrum.

This is certainly the most difficult foe of the tournament, as Isiah said, no doubt!

<blank>

Well, from Aisia's point of view, she didn't say anything about socks because "Aruji-sama, you are kind to women ......".

The name Misha is a common name for Cat-Beastmen.

<blank>

Let the games begin!

'First move, first move, first move, first move, first move!

<blank>

And then, Misha comes running zigzagging at a very high speed to close the distance.

Right or left, no, up, but down!　I stopped Misha, who was trying to dive under my crotch, by pinching him between my legs.

<blank>

Ginyah!"

"Curse you, anomalous Frankensteiner!"

<blank>

Then I jumped with Misha in between my legs. As if we were doing a trapeze, I did a backflip in mid-air with Misha between my legs. I used the momentum to slam Misha's head into the ground.

<blank>

Pggiiiight!　I'm going to go-eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

"Oh, you're as sturdy as you'll get in the semifinals."

"Ohhh, you're going to keep up with my speed, you're going to do it too. ......!"

<blank>

He escaped from me and stood up, but he seemed dizzy and unsteady on his feet.

An obvious opportunity. But I dare to look at it.

<blank>

"There you go, get yourself back on your feet.　I'll wait for you."

The skirt is a little too loose, but it's not too loose.　I'm not going to let go of you!　Stop!

"You're wearing spats inside, that's fine, it doesn't diminish anything."

I'm being looked around so much!　I'm losing my energy!"

<blank>

He hit me and I avoided him and kept my distance.

And just to be sure, I checked, they were knee-socks. It wasn't some body hair masquerading as knee-socks!　You did it, Misha, you're mine!

<blank>

I think I'll start by ...... sliding those spats down."

What are you up to, oma......?

<blank>

Holding her skirt down, that one also distances herself. --What am I up to?

<blank>

Of course, it's obvious, to enhance the taste of your socks with shame!

<blank>

<blank>

Carina. Fight seriously."

<blank>

I was warned by the referee.

<blank>

I said, "...... Oh man, if I fought seriously, I'd be killed in an instant, Mr. Referee. So I had no choice but to make it more exciting?　Right?"

That would be disrespectful to your opponent. Next time, if you fight seriously, I will call a foul on you.

<blank>

Geez, Misha, what a strong opponent to have the judges on your side: ......!

Fighting and humiliating while being serious ...... No, no, no, no!　You must be judged unserious at the sock-grabbing stage!

<blank>

I said, "...... Damn, you saved my life, Misha. I'll give you a real fight from here."

"What?　You didn't mean it, did you?

<blank>

As I said, I don't want a sock until I weigh it against losing 820 gold coins, me!

<blank>

God Wants It?"

<blank>

Oh, God!　Please don't suddenly interrupt me!　This money includes Mr. Dia and Mr. Masilo's portion, so it's not just my money!

<blank>

'Oh, well, I'll put 820 gold coins, no, 1000 gold coins on Misha's socks as a bonus!

I knew things had changed. I can lose here ......!"

'Hey, what's with this guy? Too emotionally unstable. ...... Is it the day of the month?"

<blank>

Misha players who don't hear God's voice won't understand.
