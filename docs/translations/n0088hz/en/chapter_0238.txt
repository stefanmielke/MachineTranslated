# Mashiro-san and Misha

<b>

Just as I returned to the living room, Mashiro-san had just arrived.

It seemed that Diah-kun was using the bath, so they were waiting for their turn.

<b>

"Hey, isn't that Misha? What are you doing... no way, did Karina hit on you?"

"Eh? Ah! Isn't that Mashiro! When did you come back to Terrarialby? If you came back, you should have shown your face! And you know Karina?!"

"Huh? You two know each other?"

<b>

Well, since it's Mashiro-san's home country, and both Mashiro-san and Misha are pretty strong, it's not surprising if they had crossed paths at tournaments or something.

<b>

"Well, we are acquaintances."

"We're tied by a rotten bond."

<b>

Mashiro-san and Misha said this in a somewhat curt manner.

<b>

"I see, so you were dating? That must be awkward if she's your ex."

"Karina!? Did you even listen to the conversation!?"

"We did have some scuffles, but we weren't dating. Want me to show you in bed?"

"Ah, today I'm reserved by the Five Elders, so let's do it tomorrow with the three of us."

"Eh. Misha is joining too? ...That's a bit much."

"Don't drag me into this! I don't want to either! And you guys are that kind of relationship!?"

<b>

Mufuhun, I'm so popular it's a problem! Just kidding!

<b>

"Also, Misha, I haven't actually returned to Terrarialby, okay? It's just that Karina's house is a bit strange."

"Oh, I see. ...Well, it seems like you have some connections with the gods... I never thought I'd actually meet a god..."

<b>

At that moment, Mashiro-san's eyes widened.

<b>

"Eh, g-god? ...You met a god!? Wow, that's amazing."

"Yeah, I did. ...No way, Mashiro, you haven't met one? Nyahaha! Then I win!"

"Wow! The butt that pleases the gods!"

"Stop calling me that, Karina!? I need the god to lift my curse, you know!?"

"What the heck, tell me in detail. If Misha is uncomfortable, it must be a fun situation, right?"

<b>

Nishishi, Mashiro-san smiled cheerfully, showing her fangs. That's exactly right.

So, I explained to Mashiro-san about "the butt that pleases the gods."

<b>

"...I'm starting to feel a bit sorry for Misha."

"Oh, how kind."

"But you're also at fault, Karina. You should have shown some restraint... Well, revenge was initiated by Misha, so it's her own doing... So, did the statue of the god really glow because the god was happy?"

"It was super enthusiastic. ...They said to keep coming to the church for a while, saying they wanted to see my butt."

"I'm really starting to feel sorry for Misha... There's no way curses are real, right? Or is it a self-inflicted thing? ...Well, I don't want to be cursed by a god, so I'll keep quiet about it to Misha."

<b>

Yeah, as expected of Mashiro-san. Calm and accurate judgment...!!

Can she see through my boss's personality too? Is she really watching me that closely? I like it!

<b>

"...So you don't deny that a god might curse someone?"

"Well, it's that god, after all."

"I guess I should be a bit kinder to Misha..."

<b>

After that, Mashiro-san tried to be nice to Misha, but when Misha said, "Eh, what? That's gross, Mashiro," she stopped being nice.

By the way, I'm going back to the book publication work now.

Actually, it's still not finished...)
