# Mr. Mashiro and Misha

<blank>

When I returned to the living room, Mr. Masilo had just arrived.

The bath was in use by Dea, so it appeared that she was waiting her turn.

<blank>

I mean, it's Misha, isn't it? What are you doing ......, did Karina hit on you?"

What?　Ah!　It's Mashiro, isn't it?　When did you come back to Terra Realvy?　If you're back, show your face!　I thought you and Karina knew each other!

What's that?　You two know each other?"

<blank>

Well, it is Masilo's home country, and both Masilo and Misha are strong there, so it would be no surprise if they had met each other at a tournament or something.

<blank>

Well, I'm familiar with your face.

"I'm a rotten friend."

<blank>

Mashiro and Misha each say in their own modest manner.

<blank>

"I see. So you were dating?　It's awkward being an ex-girlfriend, isn't it?"

"Karina!　Did you hear what I said?

We've had a little poking and prodding, but we haven't had a relationship. Shall I show you in bed?"

Oh, I've been booked by all the Five Elders for today, so the three of us will meet tomorrow."

What? Misha is in the mix? ...... is a bad idea."

Don't drag me into this!　I don't like it either!　I mean, are you guys like that?

<blank>

Muh-huh, I'm so irresistible, I'm in trouble!　What a surprise!

<blank>

And Misha, I didn't go back to Terra Realvy.　There's just something wrong with Kalina's house.

Oh, oh. Oh, I didn't know that. ......Well, it looks like you've been seeing God. ......I didn't think I'd be meeting God himself. ......"

<blank>

And that's when Mr. Masiello opened his eyes.

<blank>

'Eh, ka, God? ...... You met God!　Eh, wow."

You met him?　I met him. ............ Don't tell me you've never met Masilo?　I'm not sure!　Then I win!

I'm not going to let you do this!　God-pleasing ass!"

Don't use that name, Carina!　I'm going to have to ask God to break the curse!

I'm just saying," he said, "you can be more specific. If Misha doesn't like it, it must be fun, right?

<blank>

Masilo-san smiles wryly, showing his fangs. That's right.

So I explained to Mr. Masilo about the "God-pleasing buttocks".

<blank>

...... I'm starting to feel a little sorry for Misha."

"Oh, how sweet."

I mean, you're you too, Karina. You should have some consideration for your own wellbeing. ...... But since Misha was the one who initiated the revenge, did he deserve it? ...... So, was God really happy when the statue of God lit up?

"He was so flippant. He told me to go to church for a while ...... because he was going to examine my butt."

'I knew it, I'm starting to feel sorry for Misha. ...... Is it a normal curse or a lie?　Or is she acting? ...... Well, I don't want to be cursed by God, so I won't tell Misha."

<blank>

Yes, that's what I'm talking about, Mr. Masilo. Calm and precise. ......!

Are you the kind of person who sees through my boss's personality too?　Do you really look at me that much? I like you!

<blank>

"...... you don't deny that God might curse you?"

"Well, he's that God."

"Let's be a little nicer to Misha: ......"

<blank>

After that, Mr. Masilo was nice to Misha, but when he said, "Eh, what?　That's gross, Masilo." So he stopped being nice to her.

I mean, I'm going to go back to working on the book.

(Actually, I haven't finished yet. ......)
