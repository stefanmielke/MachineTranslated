# I'll follow your lead, Dia-kun-chan!

<blank>

So, Mr. Kirigon, this is Misha. Please be good friends with her."

'Ususu!　If it's what Dia-kun-chan says, I'll obey her! ......Dia-kun-chan said, so I have no choice but to be friendly with you, thank you, Cat-Beast!

Well, I guess that means you'll be my friend, right?　I'm very happy to meet you!　As expected of Dia, she is very different from Kalina!

<blank>

Misha shook his hand in the form of a claw held out by Kirigon.

Also, what do you mean you're so different from me? I told you to get along with Kirigon, too. I'm going to stroke your ass.

<blank>

So, what's the situation?

Ah, yes. It seems like the merchant is the mastermind behind the threat to the village head?　So I was wondering what I should do. What do you think we should do, Misha?

'First of all, I think you should stop patting my ass, Nya. ...... indeed, not in public."

<blank>

That's true, but I refuse. And I continue to stroke Misha's butt.

<blank>

Why don't you go to ...... and kill all those merchants, nya?"

Misha, do you think I'm a murderer or something?"

If we want to protect our village, we have to stop these merchants from talking, right?　"If you want to protect your village, you need to silence those merchants.　Or do we sell out the entire demon tribe to the merchants?"

I see, that's certainly what you mean when you talk about keeping your mouth shut, ...... though there's a God-knows-what course for all of us."

<blank>

...... hmm?　But wait?

<blank>

"Ah," he said, "we don't have any obligation to protect the demon village. Thinking about it, we had no obligation to protect the village of the demon tribe.

What?　Huh?　That's right?"

I know. Because our purpose is dragons, right?"

<blank>

At first it was about the dragons taking sacrifices and they wanted to do something about it. So, the dragon did something about it.

<blank>

If we were dealing with dragons, we wouldn't have anything to do with humans, would we?"

"Oh, I see what you mean!"

I'm sure you've been here and you're not going to do that. You came all the way here and that's not ......!"

<blank>

Yohki interrupts fearfully and calls out to me.

<blank>

"Miko princess, please help us ......!"

You said, "...... Eh, no.  The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you're doing and how to do it.　

<blank>

And Deere tilted his head cockily.

The ogre tribe seemed to have realized that compared to the irrationality of dragons, human merchants were still a partner they could deal with.

<blank>

'Yes, no, but we are dealing with imperial merchants, remember?　If they find out about our village, they will send imperial soldiers to hunt us all down and make us slaves. ......"

If we are all going to be enslaved, it would be more constructive if we all abandon our villages and run away. Then let us all run away together."

"We can't just abandon our ...... village."

Huh?"　But if we all become slaves, the village will be destroyed just the same, right?　It would be much better for all of us to run away so that people are safe, wouldn't it?　Shouldn't we escape as soon as possible before we lose any more people from our village?"

<blank>

Deere-kun, who bashes away with a good argument.

The village head is speechless.

<blank>

You're right, Dia-chan!　The first thing to do is to let go of the incompetent village head who gave in so easily to the merchants!　Apologize to everyone!

What are you, a cat-bastard?　I admit I was wrong. I admit I was wrong, but you don't get to do whatever you want!

You're a pain in the ass!　Ora!　Get up! ......Your head is so high!　Bow your head!

<blank>

Misha kicks the village head. Misha is doing whatever he wants to do.

By the way, this village. By the way, this village has been secretly surrounded by soldier-like people since a while ago. Should I tell them?

<blank>

Okay, then the new village head will be this Tenshiki, replacing my brother--"

'Why don't you pick one of those who tried to stand up to the dragon as your new village chief?　It was you, you, and you."

This Tenshiki guy was hiding in the back.

<blank>

Hmmm, everyone seems to be busy deciding on a new village head, so I guess I'll just keep my mouth shut for a bit longer.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

If you get hit once, you can go for self-defense. ...... ffff.

(Notice below)

Incidentally, the second volume of the book version will be released next month, and like the first volume, I think the percentage of additions and new writings is over 80%.

I feel like I should be told that I have a reputation for writing down so much.
