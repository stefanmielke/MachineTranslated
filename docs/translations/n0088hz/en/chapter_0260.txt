# If it's what Dear-kun-chan says, I'll obey!

"Well then, Kirigon-san, this is Misha. Please get along with her."

"Ussu! If it's what Dear-kun-chan says, I'll obey! ...Since Dear-kun-chan said so, I guess I have no choice but to get along with you, so be grateful, cat beastman!"

"Um, so does this mean you'll get along with me? Nice to meet you! Wow, as expected of Dear-chan, you're completely different from Karina!"

<b>

Misha shook hands with Kirigon, gripping the claw he offered.

What do you mean I'm completely different? I told you to get along with Kirigon too, didn't I? I'll pat your butt, you know.

<b>

"So, what's the situation?"

"Ah, yeah. It seems like there's a mastermind behind the merchant threatening the village chief? So I'm wondering what to do about it. What do you think we should do, Misha?"

"I think you should first stop patting my butt. ...It's a bit much in front of others."

<b>

That's true, but I refuse. I continue to pat Misha's butt.

<b>

"...How about we just kill that merchant?"

"Misha, do you think I'm some kind of murderer?"

"Well, if we're going to protect the village, we need to silence those merchants, right? Silencing means that kind of thing, right? Or should we sell all the demon tribe to the merchants?"

"I see, that does make sense when you put it that way... Although there's also the option of making them all disappear."

<b>

...Huh? But wait a minute?

<b>

"Oh. Now that I think about it, we don't actually have any obligation to protect the demon tribe's village."

"Eh? Huh? Is that so?"

"That's right. After all, our goal is the dragon, right?"

<b>

At first, it was about wanting to do something because the dragon was taking sacrifices. And now, the dragon has been dealt with.

<b>

"If it's a dragon, that's one thing, but we have no obligation to get involved with humans, right?"

"Oh, now that you mention it, that's true!"

"J-just wait a minute, Karina! Isn't that a bit much after coming this far...!?"

<b>

Youki-chan timidly interrupts and speaks up.

<b>

"Princess Miko, please help us...!"

"Well, no. Now that you mention it, what you said is correct. If it's a dragon, I might lend a hand, but from here on out, it will be a matter between those merchants and the demon tribe... Besides, if it's against human merchants, can't we handle it however we want? It should be easier than dealing with a dragon, right?"

<b>

Then, Dear-kun tilted her head in confusion.

It seems the members of the demon tribe also realized that compared to the unreasonable dragon, human merchants are still manageable opponents.

<b>

"N-no, but we're dealing with imperial merchants, right? If our village gets discovered, we'll have soldiers from the empire sent in to hunt us all down and turn us into slaves..."

"If we're all going to be turned into slaves, it would be more constructive to abandon the village and escape together. So let's all escape together."

"...We can't abandon the village."

"Huh? But if we're all going to become slaves, the village will be destroyed anyway, right? Rather, it would be overwhelmingly better to escape together while people are still safe, right? Shouldn't we escape as soon as possible before we lose any more villagers?"

<b>

Dear-kun cuts through with a valid point.

The village chief is left speechless.

<b>

"Dear-chan is right! Then, let's start by releasing the incompetent village chief who easily surrendered to the merchants! You should apologize to everyone!"

"Eh, uh, wait, what are you, cat beastman!? I-I admit that I was wrong. I admit it, but you have no right to do as you please!"

"Shut up! Get up! ...You're still too high-headed! Bow your head!"

<b>

Misha kicks the village chief repeatedly. Over here, we're doing as we please.

By the way, this village. It seems to be surrounded by soldiers secretly, but what should I do? Should I say something?

<b>

"Alright, then the new village chief will be this Tenshiki in place of my brotherâ€”"

"How about choosing the new village chief from among those who tried to confront the dragon? You, you, and you, right?"

"This Tenshiki guy was hiding in the back, so he won't do."

<b>

Hmm, everyone seems busy deciding on a new village chief, so maybe I should stay quiet a bit longer?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

If I get hit once, I can claim self-defense... Hehe.

(Announcement below)

By the way, the second volume of the book will be released next month, but like the first volume, I think the rate of additions and new writing will exceed 80%.

I feel like it's okay to say that I'm known for writing a lot of new content.
