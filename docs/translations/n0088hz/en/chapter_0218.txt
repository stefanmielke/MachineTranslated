# Defeated in the Semi-Finals of the Tournament

<b>

Thus, I was defeated in the semi-finals of the tournament.

Well, when I think about it, if I had won, Karina-chan's fame would have been insane!

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work, my lord. ...Are you sure you don't mind not winning?"

"It's fine, the gods promised me a reward. So let's hurry and head to the church."

<b>

I need to escape quickly, or General Garou might come complaining.

After all, I created a healer because I didn't want to stand out, so why was I trying to win as Karina in the first place?

<b>

Well, now that I think about it, even if I stand out and something happens, I have the protection of the Five Elders, so if I hide in Teshin, I'll be fine. Huh? Isn't that good enough? Wouldn't it be super fun to have decadent, indulgent days in a loli harem? Isn't that seriously awesome?

<b>

...No, that would be bad for Dia-kun's education!

I need to show him a proper adult side.

<b>

Huh? Dia-kun is more reliable? That's a forbidden card.

<b>

"So, what was the last match about, big sister?"

"That's not it."

<b>

And in response to Dia-kun's innocent question, I accidentally slipped into Kansai dialect.

Before I could show him a proper adult side, Dia-kun must have obviously seen that match.

<b>

"About Misha's match, um. The gods said to do that. Probably something like exorcism?"

"Ah, I see. Exorcism... so that's what it was."

<b>

Huh? Sorry, what does that mean? I'm sorry for saying it myself.

<b>

"So, it was necessary to treat Misha that way at that moment... is that right? If not, she would have been destined to become a demon king that would destroy the world. The divine statue was shining too."

"Well, it's not absolutely necessary, but it was definitely very efficient. It was necessary to break her heart like that, right? Yeah. The divine statue was shining too."

<b>

The gods said it was okay, so it's all good! I was thinking about what was shining unnecessarily about that statue, but thank you, gods.

By the way, the reason we were able to smoothly regroup in the waiting room was also because the divine statue was shining and causing some commotion.

<b>

Having managed to make excuses to Dia-kun, I teleported with Dia-kun and Aishia to escape the approaching footsteps from the waiting room.

<b>

<b>

And off we rushed to the church!

<b>

"Oh, Siesta really has bunny ears. So cute."

"Oh, fellow. Welcome."

<b>

Siesta, with bunny ears, smiled brightly.

<b>

"Huh? Big sister, do you know this sister here?"

"Huh? Well, yes. More like—"

<b>

—More like Siesta is multiple but also one, I was about to say to Dia-kun when Siesta gently covered my mouth.

<b>

"Recently, she came secretly to pray. A devout believer, indeed."

"Oh, I see."

"Um, yeah, that's right."

<b>

While trying to match the conversation, I silently asked Siesta with my eyes, what does that mean?

<b>

"...It's a system that people in this world can't understand. To put it simply for fellow believers, it's like touching the truth of the world and having your SAN value buried, they say."

"Oh. Yeah."

<b>

If I understand it, my SAN value decreases and I might temporarily go insane.

It's better to come alone when visiting Siesta.

<b>

Anyway, I offered a prayer to the gods. Now then, it's time for the delivery.
