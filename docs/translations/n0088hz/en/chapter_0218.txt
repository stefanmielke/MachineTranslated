# Lost in the semi-finals of the tournament

<blank>

Thus, I was eliminated in the semi-finals of the tournament.

Well, if you think about it, if she had won, Karina's fame would have been in trouble!

<blank>

I'm sorry you didn't win. Are you sure you didn't win ......?"

I said, "Don't worry, God promised me a reward. So I'm going to pull myself together and go to church."

<blank>

If we don't get out of here quickly, General Garowe and others are likely to ride in to complain.

I didn't want to show off too much in the first place, so I made a healer, but why was I trying to win the championship as a regular carina?

<blank>

Well, now, even if something conspicuous happens, I can just retreat to Tessin because I have the protection of all the Five Elders. What's that?　Isn't that enough?　A loli harem with days of debauchery and debauchery, that would be super fun, wouldn't it?　Isn't it really bad?

<blank>

...... No, that would be bad for your education, Dear!

We have to show them that we're proper adults, right?

<blank>

What?　Dear, are you more solid than me?　That's a banned card.

<blank>

'So, sister, what was your last match?

No, I'm not.

<blank>

And Deere's pure little head-snapping question made me think of the Kansai dialect.

Before showing a proper adult, of course Dear was watching that game.

<blank>

He said, "Misha, you know. God told me to do that. God. Maybe, like, an exorcism?　Like that?"

'Oh, I see. Exorcism ...... is that what you meant?"

<blank>

Yeah? - Sorry.　Sorry, what do you mean?　What do you mean?

<blank>

'So you're saying that you had to treat Misha players that way, at that place ......!　Otherwise, I heard that Misha player was destined to become a demon king who would eventually destroy the world. And the statue of the god was glorious."

I'm sure it was very efficient, though not essential. You have to break their hearts like that, right?　Yeah. And the statues of the gods were shining."

<blank>

God said okay, so it's good!　I was thinking, "What's that shining statue for nothing?

Incidentally, we were able to meet up smoothly in the anteroom, partly because the god statues were glowing, and partly because there was some kind of mess going on.

<blank>

Having managed to make my excuses to Dia-kun, I transitioned with Dia-kun and Isiah to get away from the footsteps coming toward the waiting room.

<blank>

<blank>

Then GO to the church to run in!

<blank>

Siesta really does have bunny ears. You're so cute."

"Oh, my dear colleague. Welcome.

<blank>

A smiling rabbit-eared siesta.

<blank>

What is it?　You know the sisters here?"

Hmm?"　Well, yes. I mean--"

<blank>

--I was about to tell Mr. Dear that - or rather, Siesta is more than one, but he is alone - when Siesta gently held my mouth.

<blank>

The other day, he came to pray secretly. He is a devout believer.

Oh, I see."

Um, yeah, I do."

<blank>

What do you mean?　I ask Siesta with my eyes.

<blank>

"...... because the system is incomprehensible to the people of this world. To put it plainly for your peers, it's a direct burial of SAN values by touching the truth of the world."

Oh. Yeah."

<blank>

The kind of thing that when you understand it, you get your SAN values cut down and you go temporarily insane or something.

I wish I was basically alone when I come to see Siesta.

<blank>

Anyway, I prayed to God. Well, I'm going to deliver the goods.
