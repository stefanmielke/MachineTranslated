# I thought it was time to start moving on to the next place.

<blank>

Come to think of it, I didn't end up using the transformation magic I practiced, I thought.

With this in mind, I took off my healer disguise and returned to my base.

<blank>

I'm home."

Oh, welcome back, sister."

Welcome back, Anji-sama!"

<blank>

Two people greeted me, Mr. Dia and Aysia. I love this kind of thing, don't you?　It's like coming home!

<blank>

I kind of hugged them both.

Deer, you are so cute with your blushing face.

Isiah seems to be flapping his dog tail if he has one.

<blank>

'Whew, it feels like it's been a while since I've been home.

Where did you go yesterday after you went to the dungeon?"

'That's right, Aruji-sama. You said you would be home for dinner!"

Oh, yeah. An adventurer named Mashiro caught me and I stayed with him. This guy is very fluffy, and he's kind of a nice guy.

Heh, huh?"

<blank>

Deere's smile faltered.

<blank>

So you're the beastie."

He's a white wolf beastman of the full-body fluffy type. He has a cool, dignified wolf face. He's about a head taller than me.

Heh, heh, I see. ...... You still prefer cool, mature men?"

<blank>

Oh, Deere, are you jealous?　Oh, you're so cute.

<blank>

Mr. Masiello is a woman, okay?"

Oh, I see."

I'm fine!　Mashiro-san has his cute moments, but Dia-kun is cuter!"

<blank>

Dia-kun is overtly relieved.

Sorry about ...... too!　I actually spent the night in the same bed, so it's rather close to the right answer!

I don't remember much from the alcohol, but I heard he mooed around and sucked on her double breast!

<blank>

<blank>

and Aisia brought last night's dinner, which we ate as lunch.

Oh, this soup is delicious. ...... Oh, are you using the Yellow Hornet you caught the other day for the broth?　This plump white stuff is not shrimp, but shelled Hornet meat. It's a shrimp. Hornet was a flying shrimp? ......Yummmmmm.

<blank>

It's convenient to be able to keep freshly prepared dishes like this. I would like to have more large pots and pans.

I see. If you make a lot at once, you can keep it in the fridge.

<blank>

A lot of pots and pans. I guess stone pots are easy to make.　You just hollow it out and it's done.

Ah, but an iron pot is better in terms of heat conduction. I think I'll forge my own from an Armor Ant shell and make a skillet pot. Munching.

<blank>

Sister Karina, how was the dungeon?"

I went to the back to see what was there. Well, it was a sacred object, but I didn't want to retrieve it. It is the backbone of this town, and if I retrieved it, the town would collapse.

<blank>

I'm sorry to Grandma Maria for telling me, but I don't want to destroy the town to retrieve it.

<blank>

I'm going to dive in the dungeon again after this. As a healer.

Ah, then that's where I come in!"

I'll be your healer for the time being. ...... No, wait?"

<blank>

Why don't you have Isiah watch over me as a healer and I can do blacksmithing or something in the meantime? I'm sure you'll be able to find a good deal of information about the company and its products and services. ...... Well, Aisia is a slave, so she should be useful!

<blank>

I think I'll ask Isiah to keep an eye on things. If something happens, I'll be there in a heartbeat.

Yes, I'll play the healer!　I'll play the healer, leave it to me!"

<blank>

Isiah is miffed and motivated. I'm willing to talk to ...... Masilo about some of the circumstances, as much as I'm willing to talk to Grandma Maria.

<blank>

<blank>

I've heard about Terra Realby, the land of beasts, and the Ghidoraga Empire. I've heard of Terra Realby, the land of the beastmen, and the Gidlaga Empire.

'Come visit us in the land of the elves one of these days. You'll be welcome."

I also recommend Dwarf's Mountain. Let's all have a drink together, it's fun, okay?"

<blank>

I think I'll keep the ...... dwarves low on my priority list because I'm worried about Dear's chastity.
