# I wonder if it's about time to start moving to the next place.

<b>

Speaking of which, I realized I didn't end up using the transformation magic I practiced.

Thinking that, I temporarily took off my disguise as a healer and returned to the base.

<b>

"I'm back!"

"Oh, welcome back, big sister!"

"Welcome back, my lord!"

<b>

Both Dia-kun and Aisia greeted me. Yes, yes, this is nice! It feels like I've come home!

<b>

I instinctively hugged the two of them tightly.

Dia-kun's blushing face is so cute.

Aisia seems to be wagging her tail like a dog if she had one.

<b>

"Ahh, it feels like it's been a while since I came back."

"Where did you go after the dungeon yesterday?"

"That's right, my lord. You said you'd be back for dinner!"

"Oh, yeah. I got caught by Mashiro-san, the adventurer, and ended up staying over. She's so fluffy and, well, a wonderful person."

"H-Huh?"

<b>

Dia-kun's smile stiffened.

<b>

"She's a beastman, huh?"

"Yeah, she's a fluffy white wolf beastman all over. Her wolf face is dignified and cool. She's about a head taller than me."

"H-Huh, I see... So you prefer cool adult men, huh?"

<b>

Oh, was Dia-kun feeling jealous? Hehe, what a lovable guy.

<b>

"Mashiro-san is a woman, you know?"

"Oh, I see."

"Don't worry! Mashiro-san has her cute sides, but Dia-kun is cuter!"

<b>

Dia-kun visibly relaxed.

...But sorry! The truth is, since we shared a bed for the night, that's pretty close to the truth!

I don't remember much because of the alcohol, but apparently, I ended up cuddling and sucking on her multiple breasts!

<b>

<b>

Then, Aisia brought out last night's dinner for us to eat as lunch.

Oh, this soup is delicious... Wait, did they use the yellow hornet we caught the other day for the broth? This plump white meat isn't shrimp but peeled hornet meat. It's shrimp! So hornets are flying shrimp... yum yum.

<b>

"It's convenient to be able to set aside freshly made dishes like this. I wish we had more large pots."

"I see, that's true. If we make a lot at once, we can store it for later."

<b>

A lot of pots, huh? I wonder if a stone pot would be easy to make? Just hollow it out, and it's done.

Ah, but for heat conduction, iron pots are better, right? I might try forging a stockpot from the armor ant's shell. Munch munch.

<b>

"How was the dungeon, Karina-onee-san?"

"Yeah, I went to see how deep it went. Well, it was a divine artifact, but I decided not to retrieve it. It's the foundation of this town, so if I took it, the town would collapse."

<b>

I feel bad for Maria-baa who told me, but I have no intention of destroying the town just to retrieve it.

<b>

"By the way, Iâ€™ve decided to take on a request together with Mashiro-san, so I'll be diving into the dungeon again after this. As a healer, though."

"Oh, then it's my turn!"

"For the time being, I'll be the healer, so it's okay... Wait a minute?"

<b>

If I have Aisia keep watch as the healer, I can use that time for blacksmithing! ...Come to think of it, since Aisia is a slave, I should make good use of her!

<b>

"Yeah, I think I'll ask Aisia to keep watch. If anything happens, I'll teleport right over."

"Yes! Leave the healer role to me!"

<b>

Aisia is all fired up. ...I might tell Mashiro-san a bit about the situation, maybe to the same extent as with Maria-baa.

<b>

<b>

"So, as the rookie merchant Karina-chan, I think it's about time to start moving to the next place. I've heard of the beastman country Terrarialby and the Gidlaraga Empire."

"Please come to the elf country someday. We will welcome you."

"The dwarf mountains are also recommended. Let's all drink together; it'll be fun, right?"

<b>

...I'm a bit worried about Dia-kun's chastity with the dwarves, so I think I'll keep that option lower on the priority list.
