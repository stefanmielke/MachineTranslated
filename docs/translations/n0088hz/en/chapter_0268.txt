On the other hand, in the imperial capital of the empire.

Two small to medium-sized trading companies have disappeared. There are many trading companies in the empire, and it doesn't have much impact on the general public. Most of the shops and businesses have been bought by other trading companies, and even the familiar shops have only changed owners.

<b>

However, there were some. Just a few products had completely disappeared.

<b>

"What? There's no 'Demon's Horn'?"

"Yes, we sincerely apologize. The production and sale of that medicine have been discontinued..."

<b>

At the counter of the pharmacy, a nobleman who had secretly come to buy a love potion clicked his tongue in dissatisfaction. He was an old man, well past middle age, with grandchildren.

He was a regular user of the love potion 'Demon's Horn'.

<b>

"How about other medicines? For example, how about this '宿走り'? Just one sip will make any woman act like a cat in heat! I guarantee she'll run straight to the inn. Plus, it has a contraceptive effect—"

"...I want a male stamina enhancer."

"Then how about this '反太ッ刀'? By increasing mana concentration, it promotes blood flow improvement and fatigue recovery, which can lead to enhanced male functions. It’s marketed as making you as strong as a bent sword—"

"I've already tried that! It barely works at half capacity!"

<b>

Bang! The nobleman slammed the counter. The shop was sparsely populated, but the loud noise drew attention, and the old nobleman pulled his robe deeper over his head in embarrassment.

<b>

"...The strongest one, that was 'Demon's Horn', right!? Is there no stock!?"

"I’m terribly sorry, but we have zero stock... All the remaining medicines were bought up as soon as they were discontinued."

"Who is that scoundrel!?"

"I’m sorry, but I cannot disclose customer information..."

<b>

The old nobleman gritted his teeth. However, he made an effort to remain calm.

<b>

"I'm not trying to rob you. I just hope to negotiate and obtain it. Tell me."

"Well... but..."

"Oh, was this gold coin yours? You dropped it."

"...just a certain esteemed person."

<b>

After handing over a single gold coin, the old nobleman clicked his tongue again at the information he received.

The fact that the person referred to him as 'esteemed' suggests they are of royal blood. That makes negotiation difficult.

<b>

"Ugh... What about the factory!? Who was making this medicine!?"

"It seems the ranch owned by the previous trading company has disappeared, making reproduction hopeless."

"I'll pay any amount! Where did the trading company owner go!?"

"He went bankrupt and is now working for another trading company..."

"I'll provide the funds! We can create a new ranch!"

<b>

In this way, the merchants were forced to revive by the nobles who needed 'Demon's Horn', and they would gather the demon slaves they had previously sold.

<b>

<b>

And just when the slaves had gathered completely, the merchant vanished with the money, and by the next day, the demon slaves that were supposed to be left behind also disappeared like smoke, leading to the merchant being internationally wanted as an investment fraudster—but that is another story.
