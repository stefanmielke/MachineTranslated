# Meanwhile, in the Imperial Capital.

Meanwhile, in the imperial capital.

Two small and medium-sized merchant associations have disappeared. There are a number of trading houses in the empire, and they have not had a significant impact on the general public. Most of the stores and businesses themselves have been bought by other merchant associations, and only the owners of favorite stores have changed.

<blank>

But some. Only a very small portion of the products disappeared completely.

"What?　No horns?"

Yes, I am very sorry. This medicine is no longer produced or sold. ......"

<blank>

An aristocrat who secretly came to the apothecary's counter to buy an aphrodisiac clicked his tongue in dissatisfaction. He was an old man who had reached his prime and even had a grandson.

He was a patron of the aphrodisiac "devil's horns".

<blank>

How about another medicine?　For example, how about this "Shukujiri"? Just one sip will turn any woman into a cat in heat!　I can assure you that they will immediately run to the inn. And it also has a sterilizing effect.

I'd like to get some ...... male energizers."

How about this "Anti-Tattoo"? By increasing mana concentration, it is expected to improve blood flow, promote recovery from fatigue, and improve male function. With the claim of becoming like a warped sword--"

We've already tried that!　At best it's only half as good!"

<blank>

Dan!　and an aristocrat taps on the counter. Although the restaurant was not very popular, the loud sound attracted attention, and the old nobleman awkwardly covers himself deeply with his robe.

<blank>

"......The strongest one, that was the 'devil's horns', wasn't it!　Don't you have any in stock?

I'm sorry, we have zero inventory, and as soon as the ...... sale ended, all the remaining drugs in our inventory were bought up."

Who is that infidel?

I'm sorry, it's your information and I'm not at ...... to reveal it."

<blank>

The old aristocrat grits his teeth. However, he always maintains his composure.

<blank>

I'm not trying to rob you," he said. I'm just hoping to negotiate and get them to give it to me. Tell me."

No. ...... but ......"

Oops, I see this gold coin is yours. You dropped it."

"......, precious one, that's all."

<blank>

The old aristocrat makes him hold a single gold coin, and the information he gets in exchange makes him cluck his tongue for the umpteenth time.

If you are dealing with yourself, an aristocrat, you must be the 'noble one. That makes negotiations difficult.

<blank>

"Kuh ...... factories, etc.!　Whoever was making this drug!"

'It seems that the ranch owned by the previous owner of the Chamber of Commerce has disappeared, and it is hopeless to reproduce it.

I'll give you as much money as you want!　Where's the Chamber of Commerce owner!"

"Bankrupt, now doing menial work for another trading company: ......"

I'll pay for it!　Why don't you let them build a new ranch?

<blank>

In this way, the merchants are forced by the nobles who need the "demon horns" to reemerge and gather the demon slaves they sold off before.

<blank>

<blank>

The next day, the slaves of the ogre tribe who were supposed to have been left behind disappear like smoke, and the merchant becomes an internationally wanted investment fraudster - but that is another story. But that's another story.
