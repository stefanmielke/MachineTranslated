# Be resourceful while maintaining a high degree of flexibility

Well, it was double breast, wasn't it, Masilo? ...... The only thing that was swollen was the top.

You know, like a man's nipple. They don't know why they're there after the second one.

Well, I woke up in the morning and smoked that third one. Sleepwalking.

Between you and me, I was hit with a slap when I said "Hi" in the morning when he asked me if I was awake.

<blank>

Carina is the first person who has done this much with me," he said. Damn."

Sorry."

<blank>

Incidentally, as soon as I decided to stay at Masilo's house, I contacted Dia in the storage space, so it was not an unauthorized overnight stay. As for the dinner that Aisia prepared for me, I am going to eat it tonight since it should be stored in the time-stopping storage.

Incidentally, Mr. Masilo had a residence here in Carcassa. It was a square building with mud walls, apparently made with earth magic, but there were magical tools and fire and water seemed to work without problems. The toilet is also a scavenger slime, of course, so there is no problem there.

<blank>

Mr. Masilo, do you feel like you've lived in Carcassa long?"

Hmm?　Ah, I've been here for five years now. There are a lot of animals here, so I feel at home. A hairy guy like me would be out of place in other towns in this country.

<blank>

Carcassa seems to be close to the border with the beastman country, and there are many intelligible beastmen.

<blank>

'Land of the Beastmen!　Is there such a thing? Tell me more about it."

No problem. The nearest beastman country to here, however, is a small country."

<blank>

It seems that there are multiple beastman countries as well as countries of other races. It is impossible for there to be more than one country for humans.

And that country closest to here, Terra Realby, is ruled by Barbaros, the Beast King.

It is a small country, but the capital has a coliseum and is said to attract many tourists.

<blank>

Coliseum, huh?"

I've had to fight demons that I've tamed. That was fun."

Oh, the way you say it. Have you ever been out, Mr. Masiello?"

I've won a lot of competitions. I once won a competition. I was a small guy, though."

<blank>

Masilo-san smiles wryly and smugly. He is wildly cute.

<blank>

I think I'll go out there too, kind of like a tournament?"

"Oh, well, I'll put all my money on you then, just give me a call."

I was like, "Kyah, you believe me!　You're so cute, Mashiro!"

Who could beat you?"

"Oh, no, you've got this fragile-looking girl."

A weak girl ain't gonna kill a dungeon boss in a blink of an eye, right?"

<blank>

It is.

<blank>

'Oh, that reminds me. They told me to bring Karina to the guild or something."

It's a pain in the ass."

I'm the guy who cut down Trent the Great and took out Black Mantis and Mithril Devil.　I mean, if we don't show up first, he's going to identify us by name, how about that, okay?"

<blank>

Oops. I forgot that the guilds in this world are surprisingly high-tech and well managed.

Where if you were queried by the name of Karina, you would be tied in as 'Karina in Carcassa'.

<blank>

I was hasty when I said I could tell you my name."

'Hey, could it be that Karina is your real name, not a pseudonym or anything?'

Oh, I see. I'll just pretend it was an alias. Hmmm."

<blank>

Maybe this is where the healer comes in. Well, it would be a hassle to modify Isiah just for this, so why don't I just disguise myself this time?

<blank>

Even if the Adventurer's Guild later questioned Karina, she would say, "Sure, Karina is me, but ......, Black Mantis?　What are you talking about? I'm just an E rank adventurer!　Do you think you can do that? It's a solution if you insist. Okay!

<blank>

Hey Karina, I have a hunch. I have a hunch...are you thinking shallow thoughts?"

I don't want you to call me shallow. I hope you won't lick my genius.

"...... and what do you do?　It's the Great Wizard.

You have to pretend it was an alias and be resourceful while maintaining a high degree of flexibility."

Let's see. You mean?"

It's a haphazard, ad hoc response!"

<blank>

When I said this, Mr. Masilo gave me a wry look and said, "Seriously, this guy?

<blank>

I'm kidding. I'm kidding."

Really? I don't know what to tell you, but you should take your life a little more seriously.

He said, "I just teased him because he was cute. He's really thinking about it a little more.

"...... please Carina, you're making me question my sanity."

<blank>

In the meantime, I'll go with the guild. Oh, I'll disguise myself as a healer, though.
