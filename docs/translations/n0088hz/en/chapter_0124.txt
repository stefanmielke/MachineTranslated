# Maintaining High Flexibility While Responding Adaptively

<b>

Wow, so you had multiple breasts, Mashiro-san... only the top one was swollen, though.

It's like a man's nipple. Apparently, it's something that exists for no reason after the second one.

Well, I ended up sucking on that third one when I woke up. Sleepily.

When I was asked in the morning, "Are you awake?" and I replied, "Yes," I got punched in the face, just between us.

<b>

"I'm the first one Karina has treated so freely. Seriously."

"Sorry!"

<b>

By the way, I made sure to contact Dear-kun in the storage space as soon as I decided to stay over at Mashiro-san's house, so it's not an unauthorized overnight stay. The dinner that Aisia prepared for me should be in the time-stopping storage, so I plan to eat it tonight.

<b>

By the way, Mashiro-san had a residence in this Calcas. It was a square earthen wall building made with earth magic, and it seems there are magical tools, so fire and water can be used without issues. The toilet is also, of course, a scavenger slime, so no problems there.

<b>

"Hey Mashiro-san, do you feel like you've been living in Calcas for a long time?"

"Hmm? Ah, I've been here for about five years. There are a lot of beastmen, so it's pretty comfortable. Someone furry like me tends to stand out in other towns in this country."

<b>

Calcas seems to be close to the border of the beastmen's country, and there are many obvious beastmen around.

<b>

"A beastmen's country! I didn't know that existed. Tell me more!"

"Sure. Though, the closest beastmen's country from here is a small nation."

<b>

It seems there are multiple beastmen's countries, just like there are for other races. Now that you mention it, it makes sense; it wouldn't be possible for there to be only one country for humans.

The closest country from here, Terrarialby, is ruled by the Beast King Barbaros.

It's a small nation, but it seems the capital has a coliseum and attracts many tourists.

<b>

"A coliseum, huh?"

"I've fought with tamed monsters there. That was fun."

"Oh, the way you say that. Have you participated, Mashiro-san?"

"Yeah. Believe it or not, I've won a tournament before. It was a small one, though."

<b>

Mashiro-san chuckles proudly. Wildly cute.

<b>

"I might want to participate too, like in a tournament or something?"

"Yeah, if you do, I'll bet everything on you, so let me know."

"Wow, you really believe in me! Mashiro-san is so cute!"

"Who could possibly beat you?"

"Oh dear, capturing such a fragile-looking girl."

"A fragile girl wouldn't instantly kill a dungeon boss, you know?"

<b>

That's true.

<b>

"Oh, that reminds me. I was told to bring Karina to the guild."

"Ugh, that's a hassle."

"There's no helping it. It's the one who took down the Trent Great Logging and dealt with the Black Mantis and Mithril Devil, you know? Besides, if you don't take the initiative and show up, they'll probably check your name, so how's that going to work out? Are you okay with that?"

<b>

Oops. I had forgotten that the guild in this world is surprisingly high-tech and well-managed.

If they check with Karina-chan's name, it would be linked as 'Karina in Calcas.'

<b>

"I was hasty to say it was okay to give my name."

"Hey, wait a minute. Is Karina not a pseudonym but your real name?"

"Oh, right. I can just pretend it was a pseudonym. Hehehe."

<b>

This might be a job for a healer. Well, it would be a hassle to modify Aisia just for this, so I guess I can disguise myself this time.

<b>

Even if Karina-chan later questions me from the adventurer's guild, I can insist, "Yes, I am indeed Karina... Huh? Black Mantis? What are you talking about? I'm just a regular E-rank adventurer! Do you think I could do something like that?" That should solve it. Alright!

<b>

"Hey, Karina. Just a hunch, but are you thinking of something shallow?"

"Shallow? Don't underestimate my genius intellect."

"…So, what are you going to do, oh great magician?"

"I'm going to pretend it was a pseudonym and respond adaptively while maintaining high flexibility."

"Uh, so that means?"

"Impromptu and ad-hoc responses!"

<b>

When I said that, Mashiro-san looked at me with a 'Seriously?' expression.

<b>

"I'm just joking, just joking."

"Is that really true? I know it's strange for me to say this, but you should probably live a bit more seriously, you know?"

"I just teased you because you're cute, Mashiro-san. Honestly, I'm thinking a bit more than that."

"…Please, Karina, or my sanity will be questioned."

<b>

For now, I'll go to the guild together. Oh, but I'll be in disguise as a healer.
