# No good, I'm horny.

Whew, that was a good bath. (Slavee feeling)

<blank>

And I feel so guilty that I peeked one-sidedly. I'm sorry, Dear.

Deere's Deere was a pretty good Deere.

<blank>

Oh no, that was so cute I wanted to play with it.

I would eat it, you know!

<blank>

......

<blank>

<blank>

I'm accepting your Dear-kun, you know!　You're accepting Deere's Deere, aren't you, me?

<blank>

"You mean my soul is becoming a girl ......?　Nonsense!

<blank>

He is a respectable Han who recently had five local wives!

Your heart is about to fall into meth!

<blank>

Well, with Mr. Masiello, maybe, but that's not the same thing!

<blank>

<blank>

'Sis, I've given Slavee a bath!

Hiyah!　Oh, yeah!　Thank you, Dear!"

<blank>

As I writhed in my bed to bridge, Dear knocked on the door of my room.

I hastily open it and receive the slavee so as not to arouse suspicion.

<blank>

You look a little red. Is something wrong?"

Nothing. Thanks!

<blank>

As soon as he received it, he slammed the door shut as if to escape.

......Ah, yuck. I'm too embarrassed to look at Deer-kun's face. I remember how cute he was after taking a bath with a moist blush on his cheeks and how naked he was. Oh no, I'm so horny.

<blank>

"......"

<blank>

In his hand is a soft and fluffy slime. The one that was in the bathtub with Dear just now.

What can I say, it's so smooth and comfortable to touch, isn't it slime?

It can also change its shape. You can make them grow long and thin. You can make them warty. It can also be lengthened.

<blank>

I'll scan it just to make sure there are no strange pathogens or anything like that: ...... It looks okay. Yoshi.

...... just a little bit. Just a little bit.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Phew.

What can I say, sensory sharing is awesome.

I felt the slime touching my body, and I kind of had this double feeling. It was especially bad because I felt the body heat of the slime.

<blank>

Oh no, I've soiled it with sweat and bodily fluids, I'll have to take another bath. Oh, slime bodily fluids. Yeah, I know.

I think I'll have Isiah wash it for me next time. Hmmm.

<blank>

<blank>

I mean, it just occurred to me that slime bodily fluids could be used for lotions. It's so slippery and slimy. I wonder if it would turn to powder when dried?

Maybe I'll try it next time. Slime lotion, if I make a prototype, I may take it to Sister Harumikazuchi.

<blank>

If I could make lotion with slime, it would be convenient to catch it in the vicinity of Solacidore!　I might even get compliments!　And then I can demonstrate and sell it to your sister again: ......Ghehehe......

But I wonder if no one thought of such a simple idea?　Or was it a blind spot?

<blank>

At ......, there was a knock at the door of the room.

<blank>

'Hey, Karina. Are you all right?　Deerboy's worried about you."

Hmm?　Oh, Mr. Masirow?　Wait a minute, I'll open it now.

I said, "Oh, you're out. I thought you had a cold. ......"

<blank>

When he opened the door to his room, Mr. Mashiro looked relieved.

Then he sniffed once, and looked dumbfounded.

<blank>

You said, "Uh, yeah. You just got a new toy and were playing with it. I see. I'm glad to see you're still the same."

Yeah, no, yeah. Well, yeah, but..."

<blank>

That's Mr. Masiello. You know me, or what I mean.

<blank>

"Well, it happens sometimes to guys who tame slimes, ...... so, you know, moderate it."

"Oh, is this such a common idea?　Kore."

And if you don't wash thoroughly after use, you'll have a hell of a time with the itchiness. I heard that the slime's bodily fluids have a bactericidal effect, but it's so strong that it itches on thin-skinned areas.

<blank>

I heard that they even stuff slime into beast bites to sterilize them, but in some cases, the itch is so bad that it causes more pain than the pain itself. I hear it's better than dying from rotting flesh, but seriously?

<blank>

Oh, maybe I'm getting some itch ......!"

I said, "I don't need to tell you. Come on, let's go to the bathroom and I'll wash you."

<blank>

After that, I had Masilo wash me thoroughly all over my body, and I should note here that I was still a little itchy and in agony for a while.

<blank>

Now I know why slime isn't used in lotions!　Wow!
