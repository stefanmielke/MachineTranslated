# This is bad, I'm feeling all flustered.

――――

<b>

Phew, that was a nice bath. (Slavé feeling)

<b>

And I feel an overwhelming guilt for peeking. I'm sorry, Dia-kun.

Dia-kun's Dia-kun was quite something.

<b>

Wow, if that's the case, it was cute enough that I wanted to play with it.

I almost wanted to eat it, just kidding!

<b>

……

<b>

<b>

Wait, that's not good! I'm accepting Dia-kun's Dia-kun!

<b>

"Is my soul becoming a girl...!? No way!"

<b>

Even though I'm a fine man who recently got five local wives!

Is my heart about to become feminine!?

<b>

Well, it might be the case with Mashiro-san, but that's different!

<b>

<b>

"Hey, big sister, I brought you a Slavé bath!"

"Yikes!? Oh, yeah! Thank you, Dia-kun!"

<b>

As I writhed on the bed in a bridge position, Dia-kun knocked on the room door.

I hurriedly opened it to receive the Slavé, trying not to raise any suspicion.

<b>

"Hey, your face is red. Is something wrong?"

"N-nothing at all! Thanks!"

<b>

I immediately closed the door with a bang as if to escape.

...Ah, this is bad. I can't look at Dia-kun's face. The way he looks all moist and blushing after the bath is cute, and I can't help but remember his naked form. This is bad, I'm feeling all flustered.

<b>

"......"

<b>

In my hand is a jiggly slime. The one I was just in the bath with Dia-kun.

It's really smooth and feels nice to touch.

It can also change shape. Like, it can sprout protrusions. Or turn those into bumps. It can even change its length.

<b>

I should scan it to check for any weird pathogens... Seems fine. Alright.

...Just a little bit. Just a little.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Phew.

I mean, the sensation sharing is amazing.

I can feel the slime touching my body, and it's like I'm feeling it doubly. Especially since it's a slime, I could really feel its temperature, and it was intense.

<b>

Well, I need to wash it again in the bath since it got dirty with sweat and bodily fluids. Oh, I mean the slime's bodily fluids. Yeah.

Maybe I'll have Aishia wash it for me next time. Hehe.

<b>

<b>

By the way, I just thought of something, but slime bodily fluids could be used as lotion, right? It's all slippery and gooey. I wonder if it would turn into powder if dried?

Maybe I should try it next time. If I make a prototype of slime lotion, I could bring it to Onee-sama Harumikazuchi.

<b>

If I could make lotion from slime, it would be convenient since it's readily available near Sorashidore! I might get praised! And then I could do a demonstration sale for Onee-sama... Hehehe...

But, I wonder if no one has thought of such an easy idea? Maybe it's an unexpected blind spot?

<b>

...Just then, there was a knock on the room door.

<b>

"Hey, Karina. You okay? Dia-kun was worried."

"Huh? Oh, Mashiro-san? Just a moment, I'll open it!"

"Oh, you came out. I was wondering if you caught a cold..."

<b>

When I opened the door, Mashiro-san had a relieved expression.

Then he sniffed once and looked exasperated.

<b>

"Ah, I see. You just got a new toy and were playing with it. Well, that's good to hear."

"Uh, yeah, that's true."

<b>

As expected of Mashiro-san. He really understands me.

<b>

"Well, it's something that happens sometimes when you tame a slime... So, take it easy."

"Is this a common thought? This?"

"Also, if you don't wash it properly after using it, it can get itchy and you'll be in hell. Apparently, slime bodily fluids have a sterilizing effect, but it can be too strong, and it can make sensitive areas itchy."

<b>

They say some people stuff slime into wounds from animal bites to sterilize them, but then they suffer from unbearable itching afterward. It's said to be better than rotting flesh, but seriously?

<b>

"Ah, I think I'm starting to feel itchy...!?"

"I told you so. Come on, let's go to the bathroom, I'll wash you."

<b>

After that, Mashiro-san thoroughly washed my whole body, but I still felt a little itchy and ended up writhing for a while, which I will note here.

<b>

I learned why slime isn't used as lotion! Waaah!
