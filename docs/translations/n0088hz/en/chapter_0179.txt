So, let's do the Divine Artifact Returning Ceremony, Kari!

<blank>

Mee-chan smiled like the sun.

<blank>

Yeah, why?"

Nothing. It's the return of the sacred artifact.　You can't just give it back without anything."

<blank>

Besides, if you don't prove that it is genuine before returning it, you may have a hard time saying, "It was stolen, so I returned it and falsely claimed it was stolen! If you don't prove that the item is genuine before you return it, you may be accused of "misrepresenting that the item was returned because it was stolen!

They need to show that it is genuine on a large scale to make that point stand out.

I need God to cooperate with Kari, God's messenger," he said!　Can you retrieve it in a godly manner?"

"Godly or not, ...... you should come up with a production together. I think I can do most of it."

I love it!　I love you, Kari-chan!　Forge me!"

"Oh, boy."

I never thought you were a messenger of God, Kari. I knew she was something else.

<blank>

Deere-kun's coughing is seriously competent.

<blank>

I'm not that big of a messenger, though, because I'm kind of a pariah. ......I usually collect socks and offer them to God."

'Oh, you were serious when you said you were going to offer socks to God?　Then do you have some you're wearing right now?"

I've been thinking about it. "...... No, that's the potion I gave you, you know?　I think I'm going to be out of God's taste because I drank that. He says it's better if you don't smell like God himself, including me.

"Oh, so ...... we smell like God now?　Does that mean we are one of God's dependents?　Amazing!

<blank>

That's the way it could be interpreted.

<blank>

Oh, yeah. Are you going to build a door leading to Kali's base for the other four?"

'Yes, I do. I'll try not to let strangers in, but you're all special!"

It's going to make it easier for us to have defense meetings and stuff. I'm grateful."

<blank>

Like Mr. Masiello, we plan to build a room for each of the five of us and connect them there.

I guess the percentage of dwarves in the base is going to go through the roof. Ah, yes.

<blank>

I'll make you a workshop if you want.　We still have a room for making things, but it's just a small room from the point of view of the dwarves themselves. ......I don't know the details, so if you give me a blueprint, I'll make it exactly the way you want it."

!!!"

<blank>

Mee-chan's eyes widen.

<blank>

I was wondering, "......, um, what can I build in that workshop?　What is the size of the lot?　What about ventilation and airflow?　What is the average temperature?　What is the humidity?　How well insulated are the walls?　Is water nearby?　Storage?　Fuel storage?"

<blank>

A rush of questions. A first-class craftsman indeed.

<blank>

Oh, oh. You can decide whatever you want, okay?　If I just said that, I can set it however I want. I can change it later."

'You can set it up however you want! ...... julius"

<blank>

Ah, Mee-chan is in the eyes of a predator in front of its prey.

<blank>

"...... I'll have to discuss this with the other four. If we monopolize the design, we'll get the bee's knees!"

"Oh, in addition to individual workshops, it would be nice to have a joint workshop where everyone can make things together.

<blank>

Wouldn't you like to see five loli dwarves working together in a cackling giggle?

I would super like to see it.

<blank>

I'm thinking, "...... Wait a minute. Do you think Kari is a demon or something?　Are you okay?　Won't it take your soul?　Hey, Isiah. Should I become a slave too?

Vermilion-sama. I will be your slave, do not disturb me."

Uh, yeah.

<blank>

Aisia says it all with a crisp and clear voice. She is strong.

<blank>

I need to design a workshop as soon as possible!　Kari, tell me everything you can do to build the workshop!"

All of it?　Hmmm, I don't know if I can explain it all either."

<blank>

And here, Dia-kun intervenes between me and Mee-chan.

<blank>

Mr. Vermillion. All of those things can wait until after the return ceremony has been prepared."

Oh, no!　Oh no!　It's terrible of the elves to leave us with the workshop of our dreams!"

That's right, Dear. It doesn't take me any time to make it. ......"

<blank>

No. If such an ideal workshop were built, you would definitely be caged in. If such an ideal workshop were built, you would definitely cage it, wouldn't you?　It wouldn't be surprising if the dedication ceremony took place five years from now.

"...... Indeed!

"I can't talk back to the elf-kids: ......!　Damn, if this happens, I'm going to get the other kids involved!"

<blank>

Therefore, it was decided that the building of the workshop would be the reward for the success of the returning ceremony, and the preparation for the returning ceremony was carried out at full speed with the concerted efforts of the Five Elders, and the event was to be held in one week's time.

<blank>

...... Dear you are so good at using people!
