# Dear-kun's cough is really useful

<b>

<b>

"Well then, shall we hold the divine artifact return ceremony, Kali-chan!"

<b>

Mii-chan had a bright, sunny smile on her face.

<b>

"Huh, why?"

"Why, you ask? It's the return of the divine artifact, right? We can't just return it without anything."

<b>

Moreover, before returning it, we need to properly prove that it's genuine, or else we might be accused of saying, "I returned it because it was stolen!" and face unreasonable complaints.

To firmly demonstrate that point, it seems necessary to show that it is indeed genuine on a grand scale.

<b>

"We need to get the cooperation of the gods, and of Kali-chan, who is the messenger of the gods! Can you collect it majestically?"

"Majestically, huh... Let's think of a performance together. I think we can do most things."

"Yay! As expected of Kali-chan, I love you! Forge me!"

"Ahem."

"That said, I never expected Kali-chan to be a messenger of the gods. I thought you were someone special, but..."

<b>

Dear-kun's cough is really useful.

<b>

"Even if I'm a messenger, it's more like a gopher, so it's not that big of a deal. ...Usually, I just collect socks and offer them to the gods."

"Oh, so you really were serious about offering socks to the gods? Then does that mean the ones I'm wearing now are included?"

"Well, you see, I gave you that potion, right? After you drank that, it seems to have gone out of the gods' preferences. It's better if there isn't a scent of the gods, including me."

"Huh, so... does that mean I smell like the gods now? Does that mean I'm part of the gods' followers? Amazing."

<b>

It's not impossible to interpret it that way.

<b>

"Oh, right. Are you going to make doors that connect to your base for the other four as well?"

"That's right. I won't let others in, but everyone else is special!"

"That'll make it easier to hold national defense meetings casually. That's great."

<b>

Like Mashiro-san, I plan to create separate rooms for the five of us and connect them.

The dwarf ratio in the base is going to increase dramatically. Oh, right.

<b>

"How about we create a workshop? We do have a crafting room now, but from a dwarf's perspective, it's just a small room... I don't know the details, so if you give me the blueprint, I'll make it just like that."

"!!"

<b>

Mii-chan's eyes widen in excitement.

<b>

"...Um, um, can I make anything in that workshop? What's the size of the area? Ventilation, air permeability? Average temperature? Humidity? Insulation of the walls? Is there water nearby? A warehouse? A fuel storage area?"

<b>

A barrage of questions. As expected of a top-notch craftsman.

<b>

"Y-yeah. You can decide however you want, okay? If you want to set those things, you can do that. You can change them later too."

"I can set them however I want!? ...Slurp."

<b>

Ah, Mii-chan has the eyes of a carnivorous beast in front of her prey.

<b>

"...I need to consult with the other four about this. If I monopolize the design, I'll be cursed!"

"Ah, we could also create a joint workshop where everyone can have fun crafting together, in addition to the individual workshops."

<b>

Don't you want to see five little dwarf girls giggling and working together?

I really want to see that.

<b>

"...Wait a minute. Is Kali-chan a demon or something? Is it okay? Am I not going to have my soul taken? Hey, Aisia-chan. Should I become a slave too?"

"Lady Vermilion. I will be the slave of my master, so please don't interfere."

"Oh, uh."

<b>

Aisia states firmly. Strong.

<b>

"I need to start designing the workshop right away! Kali-chan, tell me everything I can do to create the workshop!"

"Everything? Hmm, I'm not sure if I can explain everything."

<b>

At this point, Dear-kun interrupts between me and Mii-chan.

<b>

"Lady Vermilion. Please wait until the preparations for the return ceremony are finished for all of that."

"Huh!? No way! To put off my dream workshop is cruel for an elf!"

"That's right, Dear-kun. It's not like it takes a long time to make it..."

<b>

"No. If an ideal workshop is created, you'll definitely want to stay there, right? It wouldn't be surprising if the return ceremony ended up being five years later."

"...That's true!!"

"I can't retort against an elf girl...! Ugh, if that's the case, I'll involve the others too!"

<b>

And so, creating the workshop became a reward for the successful return ceremony, and the preparations for the return ceremony were pushed forward at full speed with the combined efforts of the Five Great Elders, set to be held a week later.

<b>

...Dear-kun is really good at using people!!
