# Well, it's acidーーーー！！！

<b>

After spending the entire day at the blacksmith, we went sightseeing.

Since we said goodbye to Sati, from today onward, we have completely placed a door in our room at the inn, and we are resting at our base, including Aisia. Moreover, even if there are intruders, the door is concealed, so they probably won't be able to find it. Hehe, our security is perfect.

<b>

A letter arrived at our place. Actually, I completely forgot to check, and it was Dia who noticed it.

<b>

"Karina Onee-san, I just saw that a letter arrived in the mailbox."

"Eh, really? Thanks, Dia-kun. Oh, it's from Maria-baasan. Let's see..."

<b>

I opened the letter and read it. ...Hmm, hmm. Hmm. Yeah. I see.

<b>

"Read it! Dia-kun!"

"Eh, Onee-san, you can read, right?"

"I can read, but I didn't really understand it! What is this, a coded message!?"

"Ah, it's just the greetings and phrases of the nobility. Oh, there's a second page. This one seems to be written more simply."

"Eh? Oh, you're right."

<b>

Upon closer inspection, it seemed to be a two-page set. Um...

<b>

"The first page is written in the noble's phrasing, so Karichan might not be able to read it. So, I've attached a simpler version for you."

<b>

I see, Maria-baasan saw right through me. It's helpful, but then, couldn't she just send this one? Huh, she wants me to get used to it? Hmm. I'll leave that to Dia-kun.

<b>

As for the content... it seems that upon hearing we are in Calcutta, she has researched the divine artifacts in this area.

I see, I see. The dungeon core located deep within the dungeon might be a divine artifact――is it? Hmm? A dungeon core, huh. So that exists too.

<b>

"That said, since life is established here as the foundation of the town, it's a divine artifact that I won't be collecting. It's for effective peaceful use."

"That's right. I think there will be many people who would be troubled if the dungeon disappeared."

<b>

Even the dwarves we met during the day would feel the same way.

<b>

"Well, just to be safe, I think I'll take a look. That dungeon core thing."

"Eh? Does that mean you're going to conquer the dungeon?"

"I won't be collecting it, though. Just taking a look! I'll be right back."

"Eh, right now?"

"If it's just me, I can go quickly without any hesitation. The great mage Karina-chan is on the move."

<b>

You might have forgotten, but she is the strongest. Karina-chan is.

<b>

"Well, I could do it tomorrow too, but if I don't do it when I think of it, I'll forget, you know?"

"I see. Then, um, have a good trip, Onee-san."

"Okay, I'm off!"

<b>

With that, I opened the exit to the storage space leading to the dungeon.

<b>

＊　＊　＊

<b>

I emerged into the corridor beyond the boss room we conquered with Sati. Looking back at the room, the boss had respawned, so I thought I might as well defeat it quickly and collect it. Yum, turning it into potions to sell is also an option.

<b>

Then, I proceeded deeper.

As I descended the stairs, there were three ants larger than a human, walking around as if they owned the place.

Armor Ants. Their exteriors are black. Apparently, if heated and melted, they can be used as ingots, containing a lot of iron in their armor. The mysteries of biology, huh? No, are they monsters? I can't tell the difference.

<b>

They clicked at me, the Armor Ants. I didn't know that big ants make sounds.

Then, one of them skillfully arched its back and pointed its rear end towards me.

This motion... I've seen it in a certain game that protects the peace of Earth!

<b>

"Well, it's acidーーーー！！！"

<b>

Yes, I just wanted to say that. Actually, acid did come flying at me. It went "whoosh." I blocked it with spatial magic, so it was nullified. Wow, they really do shoot acid.

<b>

"Alright. I've said what I wanted to say, so, goodbye then."

<b>

I used spatial magic to sever the joints of the Armor Ants and stored them. I got materials for blacksmithing practice. I'll try it out when I get back.
