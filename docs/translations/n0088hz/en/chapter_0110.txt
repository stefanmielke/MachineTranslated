# Sa, it's acidooooo!

We completely destroyed the day at the blacksmith shop and did some sightseeing.

Since we said goodbye to Sati, we have left the door to the room at the inn and are now resting at the base, including Isiah. Even if there was an intruder, he would not be able to find it because the door is concealed. Security is perfect.

<blank>

We had received a letter. I had completely forgotten to check it, and it was Dia who noticed it.

<blank>

"Sister Karina, I just saw that you received a letter in the mailbox."

Oh, really?　Thanks, Dear. Oh, it's from Grandma Maria. Let's see. ......"

<blank>

Pip open the letterhead and read the letter. ...... hmmm hmmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I see.

<blank>

Read!　Mr. Dear!"

"Yes, you can read, can't you, sister?"

I could read it, but I didn't understand it!　What's this cryptic text!"

'Ah, the aristocratic greetings and phrases. There is a second one. This one seems to be written in a simpler style."

What?　Oh, really."

<blank>

I looked closer and saw that it was a set of two. Let's see.

<blank>

The first one was written in the aristocrat's phraseology, so Kari might not be able to read it. So, I'll add a simple version for you to understand.

<blank>

I see, you've got it all figured out, old Maria. I appreciate your help, but why don't you just come over here? Get used to it?　Hmmm. I'll leave that kind of thing to you.

<blank>

So, as for the content, ...... just heard we were in Carcassa and they were looking into the sacred artifacts that are around here.

I see. The dungeon core at the far end of the dungeon may be the sacred object - and so on. Hmmm?　A dungeon core, huh? I didn't know there was such a thing.

<blank>

However, as long as the town is able to make a living in this way as the foundation of the town, it's a sacred object that I'm not allowed to collect. It's an effective and peaceful use."

I agree. I think there will be a lot of people who will have a hard time when the dungeon disappears."

<blank>

That's exactly what happened with the dwarves I met during the day.

<blank>

'Well, let's just take a look at it just in case. I'll take a look at this thing called the dungeon core."

What?"　Does that mean you're going to attack the dungeon?"

'I don't collect, though. I'm just going to look and look!　I'll be off in a bit."

What, now?"

I can go fast without any worries if it's just me. Let's go, Karina, the great mage!"

<blank>

In case you forgot, they are the strongest. Karina-chan is.

<blank>

Well, I could do it tomorrow, but if I don't do it when it occurs to me, I'll forget about it."

I see. Well, you know, go ahead, sister."

Oh, I'm off!"

<blank>

And I opened the exit of the storage space to the dungeon.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

I went out to the passage beyond the boss room that I had attacked with Sati-tan. If you look in the room behind you, you will see that the boss was resurrected, so since it was a good opportunity, you quickly defeat him and collect it. Ummmmm, we could turn it into a potion and sell it.

<blank>

And then proceed to the back.

When I went down the stairs, I found three ants, each larger than a man, walking around with a look of their own.

Armored Ant. Its body surface is black. It is said that its armor contains so much iron that if it is heated and melted, it can be used as it is like an ingot. It is a mystery of living things. Or is it a demon? I don't know how it is different.

<blank>

They look at me and giggle and squeal. Armor ants. Ants squeak when they're big, I didn't know that.

And one of them dexterously turned his butt tip toward us as if he was shrimping.

This motion ...... is the one I've seen in a certain game that protects the peace of the earth!

<blank>

It's acid!

<blank>

Yes, I just wanted to say. No, actually acid flew at me. Bash. But I blocked it with spatial magic, so it was malfunctioning. Wow, they really do send acid, don't they?

<blank>

He said, "All right, I said what I wanted to say. I've said what I wanted to say, so let's say goodbye."

<blank>

I used spatial magic to break up the joints of the armored antes and stored them. I got some materials for blacksmithing practice. Let's try it when I get back.
