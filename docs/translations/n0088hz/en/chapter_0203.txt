# I apologized to Mr. Dear.

<blank>

Upon retrieving the socks, I apologized to Mr. Dear.

As I said, I thought it was a bit much, so I went to ...... yeah.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Dia?　I'm sorry I embarrassed you. ......"

'Yes, no. ...... that, I don't understand it at all, but ...... this is also what we need to do to save the world, right?"

"Ugggghhh ...... yes, that's right ......!"

<blank>

Holy Mother of God.

I'm sorry I spent the SP I earned on tapestries and such. ......

But I used it a lot in my practice to love Dear-kun without embarrassment, so it is an expense!

<blank>

...... No, let me excuse myself a little.

This world will not be destroyed as long as God brings us energy. And Dear, your socks are an excellent 'sacrifice' to keep God's 'interest in the world' ......!

<blank>

In other words, the embarrassment you are going through, Dear, is really going to save the world. ......

<blank>

Okay, excuse complete. I, I didn't lie!　Mental reset!

<blank>

But your sister will be wearing a dress for the afternoon competition, right?"

Yeah. White gothic lolita dress. The underwear is the same design as the ones Dia was wearing. ......　I'll give you my underwear after the tournament, so please forgive me!

I've already forgiven you!　I've already forgiven you!

<blank>

A little embarrassed, Dear, you said. I'm forgiven. It's cute.

<blank>

Don't you want my underwear?"

"......, it's okay, it's okay. ......"

<blank>

He's actually swimming his eyes a little wanting ...... Oh man, I'm having so much fun teasing you, Deere, I'm getting into the habit. I'm not sure if it's already a habit or not. I'm so excited. I'll never be able to pass on ...... my underwear. ......

<blank>

Miss, it's time to go.

Oops!　Is it that time already? Let's go then, Isiah is saving the place for us."

Yes, I'll cheer you up!　Oh, change your clothes--"

<blank>

I sent Mr. Dear to Isiah's place.

Well, I've got to go to the players' waiting room myself!

<blank>

Miss. I didn't change my clothes yet. Did you do it on purpose?

Nice assist, Arthur. Hopefully I can earn another leg?"

<blank>

And I had no pants on. I quietly put away the lovely cloth that was still warm.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So I changed into my Gothic Lolita outfit and naturally transitioned to enter the players' waiting room with a clatter.

There are many players in the waiting room. Wow, they are muscle-bound macho men, they look strong.

Over there is a beastman with a tiger face. This one also looks strong.

<blank>

A festival of sweltering men! Is that what it's like?　I, a beautiful girl, am too out of place.

The only thin player I can see is a male elf who is grooming his bow. ...... Is there any more beautiful gladiators or something?　It's a very naughty room.

<blank>

I'm sure the prize money won't be a problem, since the tournament was found by Isiah: ......

Oh, I have to bet the money I received from you, Dear, on me this time.

<blank>

I feigned a look of being intimidated by the stares of the other players and walked out of the waiting room and headed for the reception desk.

When the receptionist notices me, she smiles.

<blank>

Um, players can bet on themselves to win, right?"

Yes. Let's see, you are Karina, a D-rank adventurer. How much do you want to bet?"

'Well then, I'll take 82 gold coins for my win!

"...... yes?"

<blank>

I place the rewards that Mr. Deere received from the previous tournament - betting profits and fight money, eight large gold coins and two gold coins - at the reception desk.

<blank>

Are you serious about ......?"

I'm serious."

<blank>

As I recall, there was no limit to the amount of money a player could bet on himself?　He nods his head and shows his head.

<blank>

I'll accept ......, but you won't get a single copper coin back if you lose, okay?"

Yes. No problem. Pleasure."

"How do you calculate odds on this ......?"

<blank>

I get a betting slip for 82 gold coins.

<blank>

-resulted in me being the 8th favorite with a dividend of 10x.
