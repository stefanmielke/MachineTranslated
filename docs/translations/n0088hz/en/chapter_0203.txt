# I apologized to Dia-kun.

<b>

After collecting the socks, I apologized to Dia-kun.

I thought I had gone a bit too far... yeah.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Dia-kun? I made you feel embarrassed..."

"N-no, um... I don't really understand at all, but... this is necessary to save the world, right?"

"Ugh... y-yeah...!"

<b>

Is she a saint or what?

I'm sorry for using the SP I earned on tapestries and such...!

But I used it a lot for practice to admire Dia-kun without feeling shy, so it's an expense!

<b>

...No, let me make a little excuse.

As long as the gods bring energy to this world, it won't perish. And Dia-kun's socks are excellent "offerings" to maintain the gods' "interest in the world"...!

<b>

In other words, Dia-kun experiencing embarrassment truly connects to saving the world...!

<b>

Alright, excuse complete. I'm not lying! Mental reset!!

<b>

"But you're also participating in the afternoon tournament in a dress, right?"

"Yeah. A white gothic lolita dress. I'm also wearing the same design of thong underwear that Dia-kun had... Ah! After the tournament, I'll give Dia-kun my underwear, so please forgive me!"

"Eh, n-no, that's not necessary! I've already forgiven you!!"

<b>

Slightly embarrassed, Dia-kun said that. He has forgiven me. So cute.

<b>

"Don't you want my underwear?"

"...N-no, I'm fine..."

<b>

He actually seems a bit eager, his eyes wandering... Oh no, teasing Dia-kun is so fun it's becoming a habit. I suspect it already is. It's so heart-fluttering. ...I won't be able to give him my underwear...!

<b>

"Sister, it's about time."

"Oh! Is it already that time? Then let's go, Aisia is saving us a spot."

"Yes, I'll cheer for you! Ah, changing clothes—"

<b>

I sent Dia-kun to Aisia.

Now, I need to go to the players' waiting room!

<b>

"Sister. Dia-kun hasn't changed yet, huh? That was on purpose, right?"

"Nice assist, Arthur. If I play it right, I might be able to earn another pair."

<b>

And he's also going commando. I gently tucked away the still warm, cute fabric.

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, I changed into my gothic lolita outfit and naturally transferred into the players' waiting room.

There are many players in the waiting room. Wow, there are muscular macho men, they look strong.

Over there is a beastman with a tiger face. He looks strong too.

<b>

It feels like a festival of rugged men! And here I am, a beautiful girl, completely out of place.

The only slim player is an elf guy taking care of his bow... Is there no beautiful female gladiator around? This room is so rough.

<b>

Since Aisia found this tournament for me, there shouldn't be any problem with the prize money...

Oh, I need to bet the money I received from Dia-kun on myself next.

<b>

I pretended to be pressured by the gazes of the other players and headed out of the waiting room towards the reception.

When the receptionist noticed me, she smiled brightly.

<b>

"Um, players can bet on their own victory, right?"

"Yes. Um, you're Karina, a D-rank adventurer, right? How much would you like to bet?"

"Then, I'll bet 82 gold coins on my victory!"

"...Huh?"

<b>

I placed the rewards Dia-kun received from the previous tournament—winnings from the bet and fight money, a total of 8 large coins and 2 gold coins—on the reception desk.

<b>

"...Are you serious?"

"I'm serious."

<b>

I tilted my head, as I was sure there was no limit on the amount of money a player could bet on themselves. 

<b>

"...I'll accept it, but if you lose, not even a single copper coin will be returned, okay?"

"Yes. That's fine. Thank you."

"How will the odds be calculated for this...?"

<b>

I received a betting slip worth 82 gold coins.

<b>

---As a result, I became the 8th favorite with a payout of 10 times.
