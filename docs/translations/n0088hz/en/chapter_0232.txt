# Please make it forbidden

"……Huh!? Can't I just hide it with my tail!?"

<b>

So, Misha hid the area from her butt crack to the front with her tail. The pantyhose was shifted by the tail, making her butt slightly visible, but the dangerous parts were properly concealed.

<b>

"That's unfair!? Show more!!"

"Nyaa-hahaha! It's not unfair! What's wrong with using a part of my body, nyaaa!!"

<b>

Misha laughed triumphantly. But it doesn't change the fact that she can't win against me in rock-paper-scissors or any other battle, right?

<b>

<b>

"Ah, Karina-san. From the next round, can we please ban magical interference?"

"What!? Why all of a sudden!?"

"Well, we want to see Karina-san undress soon..."

<b>

Ah, I see. Then I guess there's no helping it.

<b>

"…What!? Changing the rules is unfairーーーー!!"

"Nyaa-hahaha! The referee is saying this, so you should comply, nyaaa!!"

"Ughhh!!... As long as I don't interfere, it's fine, right!?"

"Well, if it's like the first time with a tie, that's okay? I just want to see you undress."

<b>

...Alright! If that's the case, we can escape with the life difference!!

<b>

"Let's do rock-paper-scissors!!"

<b>

So, Misha and I both put out ambiguous hands again. With this, it's a tie, and we both lose one card――

<b>

"――Misha's hand is scissors! Karina's hand is empty, so Karina loses!"

"What!?"

"Nyaa-hahaha!! I saw through it, I saw through it! Your hand was linked to my right hand, nyaaa..."

<b>

Smirking, Misha showed her scissors. With her left hand.

<b>

"That's right! With the left hand!! If one of your hands is ambiguous and the other is a solid hand, then obviously the solid hand is valid!!"

<b>

Misha laughed triumphantly. She's smart, damn it!

<b>

"Now then... take off your top clothing!! I know, right? It's the same as Dia-chan's, it's a one-piece type! And you don't have a bra anymore――which means you'll have to use one hand to cover your breasts!! That way you'll have one hand free, and I'll have both hands! There's no way I can lose now!"

"Ughhh!! Seriously, how did you get so smart all of a sudden, Misha!"

"Nyaa-hahaha! This is the true power of me, the successor of the wise general Misha!"

<b>

Originally, there was a cat beastman named Misha, and it seems she was named after her.

<b>

"Ugh, I can't help it――here I go!"

<b>

I followed Misha's instructions and pulled down the one-piece part. And then――

<b>

"……!? Hiding with my hair, huh!? But if I move, it'll be visible, you know?"

"Well, let's see about that?"

"Mm?…Mm!? What's going on with that!?"

<b>

I used spatial magic to perfectly place my hair on my chest, hiding the tips. This is safe!!

The venue erupted with "It looks like it might be visibleーー! But that's goodーー!!" But I defended the tips!

<b>

How about that, Misha!! I borrowed the idea of hiding with my own body!

<b>

"Now, I can still use both hands, you know?"

"…Hehehe, if it comes to this, then I'll have to take off your pants next, nyaaa!?"

"Since the pannier is still on, Misha's top will fly off first…!!"

<b>

In terms of life, it's fifty-fifty... Now, shall we settle this, Mishaーーーー!!
