# Please don't.

"...... Ha!　Why don't you just hide it with your tail!"

<blank>

Misha hid her buttocks from the crack to the front with her tail. The pantyhose were shifted by the tail and the buttocks were slightly visible, but the dangerous part was well hidden.

<blank>

Oh, no!　That's not fair!　Give me more rounds!

'Nyah hahaha!　I'm not cheating!　What's wrong with using a part of your body, nyaaahhhh!"

<blank>

Misha is smiling high with pride. But it doesn't change the fact that you can't beat me in rock-paper-scissors-scissors or in a slap-and-pass attack, does it?

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, Karina," he said. From this time on, no magic interference?　Please don't say "magic interference" next time.

What?　Why all of a sudden?

No, we're about to see Karina take her clothes off, too. ......

<blank>

Oh, I see. Then I guess it can't be helped.

<blank>

"I wonder if it's going to be ......!　It's not fair that they're changing the rules!

'Nyahhhhhh!　The referee says this, so you better follow it nyaaahhh!"

'Gnnnnnnnnnnnnn! I hope you didn't sabotage ......!"

"Well, I don't mind if we do it together like we did the first time.　I just want to see you take your clothes off."

<blank>

......Yes, that's a good idea!　Then we can get away with this one by a life margin!

<blank>

"Slap it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-paper!"

<blank>

And Misha and I play another ambiguous hand. We now phase, and we both get a piece--

<blank>

Misha's chokis!　Kalina is without a hand, so Kalina loses!"

What?

I've seen through it!　I saw through it, I saw through it!　Because your hand was linked to my right hand. ......"

<blank>

Grinning, Misha shows his choki. Left hand.

<blank>

Yes!　The left hand!　If one of the two hands is ambiguous and the other is firm, then of course the firm hand must be effective!

<blank>

Misha smiles triumphantly. You're smart, damn you!

<blank>

"Come on, ......, I'm going to ask you to take off your clothes!　I know, right?　I know it's a one-piece dress that matches Dia's. And you don't have a bra anymore - which means you'll have to use one hand to cover your tits!　And you don't have a bra anymore - which means you'll have to use one hand to cover your tits!　That way, you'll have one hand and I'll have two hands!　I'm not going to lose anymore!

Gunnnnn!　You're real smart, what's up all of a sudden Misha!"

Nyahahahaha!　This is my true nature, having inherited the name of Misha the Wise!"

<blank>

It is said that it was originally named after a famous cat-and-beast general named Misha.

<blank>

Damn it, I can't help it--too!

<blank>

I quickly take off the one-piece part of the dress as Misha had instructed. And then--

<blank>

"......!　You hide it with your hair, huh?　But if I move, you'll see it, won't you?

Well, what do you think?"

Hmm?" ...... nn!　What's going on with that?

<blank>

I use spatial magic to put my hair spiffily on my chest and hide the tip. It is now safe!

The audience said, "It looks like you can see it, but you can't!　But that's good too! But that's okay too!　I defended the tip to the death!

<blank>

How about that, Misha!　The idea of hiding it with your own body, I'm cracking up!

<blank>

Come on, I can still use both hands, can't I?"

"...... kuku kuku, if this happens, next time I'm going to take off my pants, nyaa!"

Misha's jacket will fly off first because the panniers are still on. ......!"

<blank>

Life-wise, it's 50-50 ...... Now, let's settle this, Mishaaaaaaaaah!
