# Well, that's right!　Continue!

So, we each took off one piece of clothing, but of course, that was not the end of the game.

More importantly, this battle is the final. It is expected to be a battle to the very end, to the bare bones.

<blank>

Therefore, I modified the rock-paper-scissors magic--and

<blank>

"Slap it, cover it, rock-paper-scissors-paper! --What?

<blank>

This time, Misha played choki and I played goo.

<blank>

<blank>

Then I pat Misha on the head, who stiffens.

<blank>

I'm going to go to "......ッ, nya?　What did you do?　What did you do?

What? Did you see something?　Any proof that I did something?"

<blank>

Misha, now out of his rigidity, grunts and keeps his mouth shut.

From Misha's point of view, it was not unreasonable, since his hand was forced into choki and his body stiffened immediately after losing.

<blank>

Well, in other words - "If you fix your opponent's hand with spatial magic, there's no way you can lose! That's it.

And if you harden it with spatial magic, you can't even defend it, right?　It is.

<blank>

I guess so...now let's get you out of that annoying arm ring!"

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

<blank>

Misha removes the cloth ring on his arm and slaps it on the floor.

Or rather. Come to think of it, I've done 'harden and manipulate the body with spatial magic' for Misha in previous competitions.

Did I forget that?　Are you a silly boy?　Cute!

<blank>

"Well, well, well, Carina's got the upper hand!　The designated ring of arms is a rushing play for us!"

He's using magic!　He's using magic!　He's using magic!

I'm not making any accusations. What magic?　There is no rule that says you can't use magic to interfere in the first place, and I didn't hurt her, and Misha can take off her clothes, so it's fine.

"...... Well that's right!　Continue!

Nyaaaaahhh!"

<blank>

You started this fight. Brace yourself, Misha!

<blank>

"Slap it, cover it, and play rock-paper-scissors-paper!"

<blank>

And Misha can't resist my (magic), and he keeps piling up losses one way and another.

<blank>

The rings on my arms are gone, too. ...... should I go skirt up now?"

What?　Wait!　I'm wearing pants right now!

"Hmmm. Come to think of it, you took it off first. Then, let's go with the skirt."

<blank>

The audience cheered, ""Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!" and cheers.

<blank>

Don't you listen to me!

Why don't you just hide it with your hand? With your hand. Ah, but that's the thing, with one hand, I'll be at a disadvantage at once in the attack after the rock-paper-scissors. ......!

I don't give a fuck about offense or defense anymore. ......

<blank>

Misha gets teary-eyed, but takes off her skirt.

Because of the pantyhose I gave her, she couldn't see me directly - but she gently hid her crotch with her hand.

On the other hand, her pantyhose-covered buttocks were in full view, accentuating their lines.

<blank>

'This!　That's the ass that pleases God!!!!"

"Shut up, ref!　What the hell is God doing pleasing with his butt in the first place!"

That's right. Only when my performance is added to it does it become 'the real thing'."

Don't you dare say that you're playing a joke too!　Don't you dare call a butt-whipping a performance!

As for God, I'm enjoying Misha's yelling, performance or no performance!"

<blank>

The voice of God heard in the clear. I heard there's at least one statue of God in the arena, but you don't think he's glowing, do you?

<blank>

Oh, I'll make it shine. It looks more interesting that way. Light it up!

<blank>

The god statue glowed softly with a twinkle. Sorry Misha, I thought of something else.

<blank>

<blank>

!　God's statue glowedーーー!　Ki, a miracle!　A miracle happened at a tournament like this... ohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

I'm not going to believe in God anymore.　I'm not going to believe in God anymore. ......

'Ohhhh!　Don't stop believing!　You're so cute, you're so cute, Misha!　Hah, I want to put her on my lap and make her look good. Pantyhose buttocks.'

<blank>

Misha breaks down in tears.

Come on, man, we're still in the game. Pull yourself together, okay?
