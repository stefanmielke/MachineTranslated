# Well, that's right! Let's continue!!

<b>

Now then, we've both taken off one piece each, but of course, that's not enough to end the match.

Especially since this battle is the finals. Until the very end, a fight until we're completely naked is expected.

<b>

So, I modified the rock-paper-scissors magic――

<b>

“‘Hit, cover, rock-paper-scissors!!’――!?”

<b>

This time, Misha threw scissors, and I threw rock.

<b>

<b>

And I lightly tapped Misha's head, who was frozen in place.

<b>

“...Huh, meow?! Karina, you?! What did you do?!”

“What do you mean? Did you see something? Any proof that I did something?”

<b>

Misha, freed from her paralysis, bit her lip in frustration.

From Misha's perspective, her hand was forcibly turned into scissors, and right after losing, her body froze up, so it's understandable.

<b>

In other words――‘If I fix my opponent's hand with spatial magic, there's no way I can lose!’

And if I solidify her with spatial magic, she can't defend herself, right? 

<b>

“Well then, let's get that annoying ring off your arm!”

“Grrr!!”

<b>

Misha took off the cloth ring on her arm and slammed it onto the floor.

By the way, I just remembered that I had used ‘spatial magic to immobilize and control’ Misha in the previous tournament.

Did she forget that? Is she a bit silly? How cute!

<b>

“Now, now, is Karina the favored one?! The specified target is the arm ring, which is a teasing play for us!!”

“J-Judge! This girl is using magic! She's interfering with magic!!”

“Stop with the baseless accusations. What magic? There’s no rule against using magic to interfere, and I didn’t injure you, plus Misha can still take off her clothes, so what's the problem?”

“...Well, that's right! Let's continue!!”

“Meowwwwwww!?”

<b>

You started this fight. Be prepared, Misha!

<b>

“‘Hit, cover, rock-paper-scissors!!’”

<b>

And Misha, unable to resist my (magic), continues to accumulate losses unilaterally.

<b>

“Now that the ring on your arm is gone... shall we move on to the skirt?”

“—Huh?! W-Wait a minute?! I'm not wearing any pants right now!?”

“Hmm. Now that you mention it, I did take those off first. Then, let’s go with the skirt.”

<b>

Cheers erupted from the audience, “Ooooooohhhhhh!!!”

<b>

“Are you even listening to me?!”

“Just cover it with your hands. Oh, but if you use one hand, you'll be at a disadvantage in the post-rock-paper-scissors battle...!!”

“It's too late to worry about offense and defense now...!”

<b>

With tears in her eyes, Misha took off her skirt.

Since I gave her pantyhose, it wasn't visible directly, but――she gently covered her groin with her hand.

On the other hand, her butt wrapped in pantyhose was clearly visible, emphasizing that line.

<b>

“This is! A butt that pleases the gods!!!”

“Shut up, judge!! What do you mean the gods are pleased by butts?!”

“That’s right. It’s only when my performance is added that it becomes ‘real’.”

“Don’t you dare say something so ridiculous!! Don’t say that slapping butts is a performance!!”

‘As a god, I enjoy seeing Misha-chan shout, so whether there's a performance or not doesn’t matter!!’

<b>

I could clearly hear the voice of the god. Apparently, there’s a statue of a god in the arena, but there's no way it's glowing, right?

<b>

‘Ah, I’ll make it glow. That sounds more interesting. Hey, light up!’ 

<b>

The statue of the god shone softly. Sorry, Misha, I thought of something unnecessary.

<b>

<b>

“!? The statue of the god is glowingーーーー!? A miracle! A miracle has happened in this tournamentーーoohhhhhh!?”

“What the heck is this? I’m seriously going to stop believing in the gods now...”

‘Ahhh! Don’t stop believing! You’re so cute, Misha-chan! I want to pat you on my lap. Your pantyhose-covered butt.’

<b>

Misha broke down in tears.

Hey, hey, we’re still in the middle of a match. Get it together, will you?
