# Thus, the returning festival was a great success.

Thus, the returning ceremony was a great success.

One of the reasons for this is that he was rewarded with the quasi-divine "foot-row fertility" weapon.

<blank>

Well, the festival was a lot of fun!"

By the way, Karina, how much money did you make this time as a merchant? How much money did you make as a merchant this time?"

"...... ah!　Come to think of it, I'm not doing any business at all. ......!"

<blank>

Festivals were a good time to make money as a merchant!

<blank>

I've been so busy running ...... and working with the Five Elders that I've completely lost track of it all. ......!

Thanks for your time."

<blank>

Ugh. Carina Shonin's name weeps. ......

<blank>

<blank>

So, even though I was not able to make any money at the festival, I thought I would use the power of the Five Elders to make some money here.

<blank>

<blank>

I have rather a lot of power as the Five Elders, that is, the heads of state, have become my wives through and through.

If you ask for something, all the Five Elders will grant it.

<blank>

However, I can't ask for too much.

I was lucky to get the return of the sacred artifact this time because it was a request that I was allowed to fulfill, but if this had been about making all the Tessin dwarves my wives and creating a super harem, it would have been absolutely impossible.

<blank>

It's also a good idea not to ask them to cover up for a serious crime, well, you shouldn't.

It would not be impossible, but it would be a waste of money. The power, or rather the authority, of the Five Elders will be reduced.

<blank>

And there are places where power does not extend to "guilds," which are organizations that span the country.

<blank>

An example would be a 'license to handle alcoholic beverages.

It seems that Tessin has already issued the largest number of these in the country, so it would not be easy to issue new ones to me.

When an existing license holder retires due to misfortune, there is a long line of people waiting for their turn.

<blank>

Well, it might be possible to interrupt that order. ......

<blank>

I don't want to tear up such a side note against a person who is in the serious business of alcohol.

It's Carina, who I respect as a senior or something.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Therefore, I asked Mee and his team to buy everything they had on hand for sale, and only to introduce me to good sake from good breweries.

<blank>

He bought it with a great deal of color, so he had a whopping two gold coins in his possession!

It is equivalent to 2 million Japanese yen! (according to Karina-chan)

<blank>

And even though the liquor trade is basically a gray tessin, fire wine is treated as liquor, so we need to keep it within the bounds of private transactions here - but we need to keep it within the bounds of private transactions.

<blank>

What an absurd theory that "all the Five Elders drink so much that no matter how much they buy, it is within the range of private transactions" is also accepted!　Yes, if you have the power!

<blank>

<blank>

Come on, give me my all as a merchant - as much fire wine as two gold coins can buy!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

...... Eh?　I'm sure there are plenty of normal dwarves who drink this much, so you don't have to make excuses like that?

Oh, oh. Okay.

(In addition, the discount for referrals was 10% lower than the price of the original.)

<blank>

<blank>

Well, I was able to sort out some of my stuff, and I heard that wholesaling fire wine to merchant guilds in other countries can be worth three gold coins, so I made a profit, if you ask me, right?

Yeah.

...... I'm not sure how to explain it.

(I'm torn between writing a new piece for KakuyomCon and promoting Atogoji.

Damn, I could write both if my writing skills were better. ......!

The official account is still frozen.
