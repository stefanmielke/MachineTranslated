Thus, the return festival ended in great success.

One of the factors was receiving the semi-divine artifact "Foot-Pedaled Abundance" as a reward.

<b>

"Wow, that festival was so much fun!"

"By the way, Sister Karina, how much did you earn as a merchant this time?"

"……Ahhh!? Now that you mention it, I didn't do any business at all……!!"

<b>

The festival was a prime opportunity for merchants to make money!

<b>

"……I was so busy with the management side and focused on taking care of the Five Elders that I completely forgot about that……!"

"Thank you for your hard work."

<b>

Ugh. Karina Shonin's name is going to be tarnished……

<b>

<b>

That being said, even though I couldn't earn anything at the festival, I thought I might as well use the power of the Five Elders to make some money.

<b>

<b>

The Five Elders, meaning the top of the country, have quite a bit of power over me, as I have become their consort.

If I ask for something, the Five Elders will likely grant it.

<b>

That said, I can't ask for anything too outrageous.

This time, the request for the artifact return was fortunate enough to be a reasonable request, so it was granted, but if I had asked to make all the dwarves of Tesshin my wives and create a super harem, that would have been absolutely impossible.

<b>

It would also be better to avoid asking for protection for serious crimes.

While it might not be impossible, it would be a waste. It would diminish the power, or rather the authority, of the Five Elders.

<b>

Moreover, there are areas where their power does not extend, such as the organization that spans across countries, the "Guild."

<b>

For example, things like "liquor handling licenses."

It seems that Tesshin has already issued the maximum number of licenses as a country, and it wouldn't be easy to issue a new one to me.

Even if an existing license holder experiences misfortune and retires, there is a long line of people waiting.

<b>

Well, it might be possible to cut in line, but……

<b>

I really don't want to pull such a stunt on those who are seriously engaged in the liquor business.

I respect my seniors, after all.

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, I decided to just have Mi-chan and the others buy all the items I had for sale and introduce me to good liquor from reputable breweries.

<b>

They bought it at a generous markup, so I ended up with a total of two gold coins!

That's equivalent to about two million yen! (According to Karina-chan's research)

<b>

And while liquor trading is generally gray in Tesshin, fire liquor is treated as liquor, so it needs to stay within the realm of personal transactions――

<b>

Surprisingly, the ridiculous theory that "the Five Elders drink a lot, so no matter how much you buy, it's within the scope of personal transactions" also holds true!! Yes, as long as you have power!!!

<b>

<b>

Now, as a merchant, I want as much fire liquor as I can get for two gold coins!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

……Huh? You mean to say that even ordinary dwarves would drink this much, so I don't need to make excuses?

O-oh. Is that so?

(Also, there was a 10% discount for being a referrer.)

<b>

<b>

Hmm, well, I've managed to organize my various belongings, and it seems that selling fire liquor directly to merchants from other countries would yield three gold coins, so I did make a profit, but……?

Yeah.

……I feel a bit uneasy about this?

Damn, if only my writing skills were higher, I could do both……!!

By the way, it seems the official account is still suspended.

For now, the list of store bonuses has been released, so I’ve changed the link for the cover image to that.)
