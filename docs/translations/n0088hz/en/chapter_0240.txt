# It was a piece of cake. Because dragons, you know?

<blank>

This is a bit of a jump, but Dia-kun participated in the main tamer competition, the "Grand Obedience Cup" or something like that, and he won.

<blank>

'...... winner, dear player!　The white silver princess who appeared like a rising star!　The legendary dragon priestessーーーー!　Riding her partner, the dragon, she laid waste to the competition with only one body!

<blank>

Do, do, do. ......

It was an easy win, wasn't it?　Dia-kun-chan!

<blank>

That's right. It was an easy win. Because dragons, you know?

In the first place, unlimited tamers are like boxing fights in which men and women fight in mixed weight classes from the heaviest to the lightest, or like the 100-meter race in which participants are allowed to ride bicycles and motorcycles.

<blank>

So, dragons are destroying the environment, like bringing Iron Golem and bullet trains (and they can be aided) there. It's terrible.

<blank>

Most of them would get stuck with a glare, fall down with a light breath, or get out of control if they flew in the sky. There were also some bird monsters, but they fell down quickly if you hit them hard enough.

Thunder Dragon, even in the sky, is seamless. And Dia-kun, the only weak point, has also gained quite a vicious defense with the Gothic Lolita Dress Ver. 2.01 made by the Five Great Old Men's Workshop.

<blank>

Arthur, you really are unbeatable."

I wouldn't lose if it wasn't for you!

Huh?"　Isn't your sister too strong when you think about it?"

It's too late for that, Deere!

<blank>

Incidentally, the betting was 1.1 times the odds of winning, and the betting limit was one gold coin. It's a bit of a sinking ship, isn't it? But it can't be helped. It's a dragon.

I heard that the prize money for winning is 20 gold coins, and Dia, you've become a rich man. ...... Oh, I earned a lot of gold coins the other day!　Hehehe, a millionaire!

<blank>

Well, we are pleased to announce that the winners, Dear and Mr. Arthur, will be inducted into the Hall of Fame!　Congratulations!"

Hall of Fame?"

Yes, it is a great honor!　It's a great honor!　Congratulations!"

"Thank you for ......?"

<blank>

And Dear nodded at the moderator's push. Well, they call it the Hall of Fame, but it's really a ban. It's the one that says you can't win, so don't answer the door. It's a ...... dragon, isn't it?

<blank>

Does the Hall of Fame give you a pension or something?　Oh, they do. Then it's unearned income. That's nice. I'll come back every year to collect!

<blank>

"Oh, I'm an elf, is that okay?"

I'm a dragon myself, so I can last a few hundred years, right?"

"...... has a long lifespan. ......, it's okay."

<blank>

Thus, Deere was inducted into the Tamer Hall of Fame.

Alright, we're celebrating today!

<blank>

<blank>

The Dragon Priestess."

<blank>

In the waiting room, Dia was stopped by a woman in a white robe.

By the way, Arthur is flying next to Deere, who is now a smaller man.

<blank>

"...... me, is that you?"

Yes. Dragon Priestess. It is a pleasure to see you.

<blank>

The woman puts her hands on top of each other a little in front of her face as if blindfolded and then bows deeply.

<blank>

No, I'm not a dragon priestess, so don't mind me. Good bye."

Please wait. Please listen to me, miko!"

I don't need you to tell me that. ......

<blank>

Deere quickly tried to leave the waiting room, but he was turned around and kneeled down. He got down further and took a pleading position.

<blank>

"We can exchange words with the Dragon-sama, that is the sign of a miko, ......!　Please, please help us, miko-sama!

<blank>

Dia stops, "Mmmm. Help me, they said.

If he is that person that Dia admires and is in love with - he would not just throw her out without even listening to her when she asked him to help her.

Deer talking to Arthur in a whisper.

<blank>

I'm thinking, "...... Hey Arthur?　Does that mean everyone who talks to Arthur is a priestess?"

What do you think?　If I had to guess, I'd say you're a priestess, right?

Hmmm." ...... Then, can I ask Arthur to listen to you?　If I ask him, it will get complicated with the priestesses and such. ......

I'm not sure what to do. Well, if Dia-kun-chan says so, it can't be helped.

<blank>

Arthur was conversing with a vocabulary book so far. He was quite used to it.

......, but they are face down and not looking at us.

<blank>

Look, look up. Arthur will listen to you."

Oh, thank you, miko! ...... Eh?　What, the dragon-sama!"

<blank>

In the woman's view as she looks up, Arthur opens a vocabulary book to show her.

<blank>

"Come on, talk to me, you lowlife."

<blank>

Arthur was also very overbearing toward those who did not have Carina's protection.

<blank>
