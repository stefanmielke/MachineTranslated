# It was a piece of cake. I mean, it's a dragon, right?

The scene shifts, and somehow, Dia-kun entered the main event of the Tamer Tournament, called the "Great Summoning Cup," and won.

<b>

"......Champion, Dia-sanーーーーーーーーーッ! The silver princess who appeared like a new star!! The legendary dragon priestessーーーーーーーーーッ!! Riding her partner dragon, she trampled the tournament with just one beastーーーーーーッッ!!"

<b>

"Uh, th-thank you..."

"It was a piece of cake, right? Dia-kun!"

<b>

It was indeed a piece of cake. I mean, it's a dragon, right?

To begin with, having no weight limit for tamers is like allowing mixed-gender fights in boxing from the heaviest to the lightest classes. It's like allowing bicycles or motorcycles to participate in a 100-meter dash.

<b>

And bringing a dragon is like bringing an Iron Golem or a Shinkansen (with a running start allowed) into that environment. It's destructive.

<b>

First of all, most opponents can't move after just one glare, and if it breathes lightly, they fall. If it flies, they can't do anything. There were bird-type monsters, but they fell immediately if slapped.

The Thunder Dragon has no openings even in the air. And Dia-kun, who could be its only weakness, has gained quite a formidable defense thanks to the Gossamer Lolita Dress Ver2.01 made by the Five Great Old Craftsmen.

<b>

"Arthur, you're truly invincible."

"I won't lose unless it's against my sister!!"

"Huh? When you think about it, isn't your sister too strong?"

"That's old news, Dia-kun!"

<b>

By the way, the odds for betting were only 1.1 times the stake even after winning, and the maximum bet was just one gold coin. How lame. But it can't be helped. It's a dragon, after all.

The prize money for winning is said to be 20 gold coins, so Dia-kun has become rich... Oh, I also made a ton of gold coins the other day! Hehe, a millionaire!!

<b>

"Well then, the champion Dia and Arthur have been decided to be inducted into the Hall of Fame! Congratulations!"

"Hall of Fame?"

"Yes! It's a great honor! Congratulations!"

"......Thank you?"

<b>

With the host's insistence, Dia-kun nodded. Well, they say Hall of Fame, but in reality, it's a ban from participating. It's a request not to show up because they can't win... because it's a dragon.

<b>

Do you get a pension when you enter the Hall of Fame? Oh, you do. So that means it's unearned income. Nice. Let's come to collect it every year!!

<b>

"Ah, I'm an elf, is that okay?"

"I'm a dragon too, so I can last for hundreds of years, you know?"

"......You have a long lifespan... Y-yeah, that's fine."

<b>

Thus, Dia-kun achieved induction into the Tamer Hall of Fame.

Alright, let's celebrate today!

"Dragon Priestess-sama"

<b>

In the waiting room, Dia was stopped by a woman in a white robe.

By the way, Arthur had cleverly shrunk and was flying next to Dia-kun.

<b>

"......Are you talking about me?"

"Yes. Dragon Priestess-sama. It is a great honor to behold your esteemed face."

<b>

With her hands clasped in front of her face as if to blindfold herself, the woman bowed deeply.

<b>

"No, I'm not actually a dragon priestess, so please don't mind me. Well then."

"Please wait. I beg you to listen to us, Priestess-sama!"

"That kind of thing is troublesome for me to hear..."

<b>

Dia-kun tried to leave the waiting room quickly, but was cornered and knelt before. Then she prostrated herself in a pleading posture.

<b>

"To be able to converse with the dragon, that is the proof of a priestess...! Please, please help us, Priestess-sama!!"

<b>

Hmm, Dia stopped in her tracks. She was asked for help.

If it were that person whom Dia admired and longed for—if they asked for help, they wouldn't just throw them aside without listening.

Dia whispered to Arthur.

<b>

"......Hey, Arthur? Does that mean everyone who talks to you is a priestess?"

"Uh, I wonder? If I had to say, I think my sister is the priestess, you know?"

"Hmm. ......Then can you talk to her, Arthur? If I listen, it might get complicated with the whole priestess thing..."

"Eh, well, if that's what Dia-kun wants, I guess I have no choice."

<b>

So far, Arthur had been communicating using a vocabulary book. He had gotten quite used to it.

...However, the other party was prostrated and not looking at them.

<b>

"Come on, please raise your head. Arthur will listen to you."

"Ah, thank you, Priestess-sama! ...Huh? W-wait, the dragon!?"

<b>

As the woman raised her head, she saw Arthur opening the vocabulary book and pointing at it.

<b>

"Come on, speak, you lower life form."

<b>

Arthur was quite domineering towards someone without Karina's protection.
