# Then slavee it.

After I finished the delivery, I met up with Dia and the others - before I went back to the slime forest in Solacidore, and I taimed a slime the size of a melon that I saw.

<blank>

Once again, this is quite different from scavenger slime for toilets, isn't it?

The scavenger slime is an artificial magical creature created through alchemy, so if we were to use a metaphor, the natural slime would be like a rat, and the scavenger slime would be like a robot wearing a stuffed rat.

So because it's made up, it can be used by people without taming skills. Mr. Skaven.

<blank>

Well, without the taming skills, the difference between the two was not so obvious.

<blank>

<blank>

I said, "Let's use ...... this slime later. Yeah."

<blank>

I quietly put the slime away in storage and returned to Akahagane to meet up with Deere and his friends.

<blank>

<blank>

I took the cavalry-capable lodgings, just in case. And I have Arthur to think about."

"Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, Dear. You're very clever."

<blank>

Okay, okay," he said, stroking her silky silver hair.

Well, can humans do tame? ...... Oh, I think they can. I don't think so, though, do you?

<blank>

I got the taming skill from God. So I've been taming slimes, so I'll just introduce you to them.

Huh?"　Oh, yes. Heh, slime. ...... It's pretty when you look at it this way."

<blank>

And Dia-kun pokes at the slime that I put out a little bit.

The slime pulled and shook.

<blank>

What is your name?"

"Yeah?　Uh, then slavee."

Slavee...... well yeah, isn't it good?"

<blank>

I should quietly add in my mind that I didn't choose the name Slavee because it was just a spur-of-the-moment idea, and I didn't use it for a sukubey use.

<blank>

And one thing rang a bell. I thought I'd try some quick visibility sharing or something like that.

<blank>

'Dia-kun, Dia-kun, why don't you go wash Slavee in the bathtub for a minute?'

What, you're going to wash slime?　I mean, can you wash this?"

I think it's washable. There's slime bathing and stuff."

I'll take care of it then. Come on, Slavee."

<blank>

And when Dia called, Slavee moved to Dia's hand.

<blank>

I'll be in my room resting.

I'll take a bath. I'll take a bath."

<blank>

I headed to my room. ...... Well. Let's share the view then.

I'm not ....... I've been looking at Deer-kun as a pretty girl lately, and my brain is bugging out when I'm hot, so I'm going to implement a plan to reset it by looking at Deer-kun's Deer-kun. Right?

<blank>

This is an important ritual to maintain a proper distance from you, Dear. Yeah.

<blank>

On the bed, I close my eyes tightly and lie down. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

...... Oh. Bathroom changing room, right?　This is Slavee's point of view. Success.

I don't know what's going on with the slime eyes, but they look solid and in full color. It is like a 360° VR movie.

<blank>

Come on, Slavee.

<blank>

--Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　Deer, titty, titty, boob, no, I mean, the tip!　I can see it!

I'm wearing a towel around my waist, but my top is bare!

<blank>

Ha!

No, Dear, it's legal because he's a boy!　What am I upset about!

What would be the problem with seeing a man's nipples, no. There shouldn't be any. ...... Calm down and let me ......!

Yes, I'm going to see Deere's Deere today to correct this brain bug!

<blank>

And the viewpoint moved of its own accord, and I was on Deer's smooth arms.

Hmmm, I mean, it's supposed to be just shared vision, but it's also reflected in hearing and touch?　Oh well.

<blank>

Oh, you're going to clean me up, aren't you, Dear? I'm looking forward to working with you.

<blank>

<blank>

......Ah, it feels so good to be washed all over by hands with bubbles on them.

And while you're at it, look at where Mr. Deere is hidden: ...... looks--
