# Well then, Slabe

<b>

After finishing the delivery, I temporarily transferred to the Slime Forest of Sorashidore before joining up with Dia and the others, and tamed a slime about the size of a melon that caught my eye.

<b>

Looking at it again, this is quite different from the toilet scavenger slime.

The scavenger slime is an artificial magical creature created through alchemy, so to put it simply, this natural slime is like a mouse, while the scavenger slime is like a robot dressed in a stuffed mouse.

Because it’s man-made, even those without taming skills can use it. Scavenger-san.

<b>

Well, the differences were subtle enough that someone without taming skills might not notice them.

<b>

<b>

“...I’ll use this slime later. Yeah.”

<b>

Gently storing the slime away, I returned to Akahagane and joined up with Dia and the others.

<b>

<b>

“I’ve booked a beast-compatible inn, just in case. Given Arthur’s situation.”

“Oh, as expected of Dia. You’re so considerate.”

<b>

Good, good, I stroked Dia’s silky silver hair.

By the way, I wonder if humans can be tamed... Ah, it seems possible. Though I definitely won’t do it, right?

<b>

“By the way, I received a taming skill from the god. And I tamed a slime, so I’ll just introduce it to you.”

“Eh? Ah, okay. Wow, a slime. ...It looks cute when you see it like this.”

<b>

Dia poked the slime I had taken out a little.

The slime quivered.

<b>

“What’s its name?”

“Hmm? Ah, let’s go with Slabe.”

“Slabe... well, I think that’s fine, right?”

<b>

I quietly added in my heart that I didn’t name it Slabe because I intended to use it for lewd purposes, just something that came to mind.

<b>

Then, I suddenly had an idea. Maybe I should try sharing my vision right away.

<b>

“Dia, Dia, could you wash Slabe in the bath for me?”

“Eh, wash the slime? I mean, can you even wash it?”

“Well, I think you can. There are slimes that take baths.”

“Then, I’ll take care of it. Come here, Slabe.”

<b>

As Dia called, Slabe moved into Dia’s hands.

<b>

“I’ll be resting in my room, okay?”

“Yes. I’ll take care of the bath.”

<b>

I headed to my room. ...Now then. Let’s share our vision.

...No, that’s not it. Recently, I’ve been seeing Dia as a cute girl too much, and my brain is glitching, so I’m planning to execute a reset by looking at Dia’s... you know?

<b>

This is an important ritual to maintain the proper distance with Dia. Yes.

<b>

On the bed, I tightly closed my eyes and lay down. Alright, activating vision sharing!

<b>

<b>

<b>

...Oh. This is the changing room of the bath, right? This is Slabe’s perspective. Success.

I don’t know how a slime’s eyes work, but I can see everything in full color. It’s like a 360° VR video.

<b>

“Come on, Slabe, come here.”

<b>

――ッ!! Dia, I-I can see your... your chest, no, um, the tip! I can see it!

You’re wrapped in a towel around your waist, but the top is completely exposed!

<b>

Huh!?

No, Dia is a boy, so it’s legal! Why am I so flustered right now!!

What’s the problem with seeing a boy’s nipple? No, there’s none. There shouldn’t be... Calm down, me...!

Right, today I’m going to look at Dia’s... you know, to fix this brain glitch!

<b>

And then, the perspective moved on its own and landed on Dia’s smooth arm.

Hmm, wait, I thought it was just vision sharing, but it seems like sound and touch are being reflected too? Well, whatever.

<b>

Oh, you’re going to wash my body, huh, Dia? W-well, please take care of it.

<b>

<b>

...Ah, being washed all over with slippery hands covered in bubbles feels so good.

And in that moment, I looked at Dia’s hidden place... I-I can see—

<b>

――――
