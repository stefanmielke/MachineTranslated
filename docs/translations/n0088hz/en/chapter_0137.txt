# Ruthless Agents (Bebay Perspective)

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

My name is Beebey. I am the leader of the "Shining Sword" and a mercenary from the Holy Land hired by the Ghidoraga Empire.

However, I am the only mercenary. The "Shining Sword" itself was made up of agents of the Empire, except for me. They were strong, yet loyal to me, their leader.

It felt good to have them in my life, as if I were a ruthless agent myself. Once a day I would get a massage, which was also very pleasant.

The only thing I was a little unhappy about was the lack of ...... women.

<blank>

Now, the request to me was to destroy the dungeon.

<blank>

This is what it takes to save the world, apparently.

Dungeons are evil entities that suck up the world's energy and lead it to destruction.

The destruction of dungeons is essential to protect the world - so they say.

<blank>

When he successfully completes his work, he is promised the title of "hero" in the empire and the luxurious life that goes with it.

<blank>

<blank>

I infiltrated the kingdom of Pavelkant for this job and gained a position within the Adventurers' Guild.

All to destroy the dungeon.

That's why I treated the beastly bastards so amiably. It was really hard work.

<blank>

<blank>

In this way, I finally succeeded in getting everyone to the depths of the dungeon the other day.

Nevertheless, the core of the dungeon was protected by wards.

<blank>

Now Cargo. What do we do from here?"

Oh. Beebey just watch. Migo, Chino."

<blank>

The twin men, Migo and Chino, together took out their magical tools.

As I worked my way through the rummaging at the wards, the wards faded and disappeared.

It seems to be a magical tool that temporarily disables warding.

<blank>

Then Joe would set off the time bomb and that would be the end of it."

I'm not so sure. Now I'm a brave man too. Why don't you just go to ...... and detonate it right away?"

The dungeon is a living thing, and sometimes it's in bad shape. "Dungeons are living things," he said. Besides, if we were to destroy it now, we would be buried alive.

I see. Well, I guess I'll just have to do it then."

<blank>

<blank>

-- and, well, that's how we were supposed to finish our mission, make sure the dungeon was destroyed, and then head back to the empire.

<blank>

And yet.

<blank>

<blank>

Everyone!　Listen up!　A bomb has been planted in the dungeon!"

What, a bomb?

<blank>

At the Adventurers' Guild, the guildmaster said something like that.

<blank>

Hey, hey, then we need to get the hell out of here!"

Don't worry, the bomb's already been disarmed. You guys!　We'll find the culprits!　It's the Imperials who are suspicious!"

<blank>

So, the first thing I did was to be interrogated by the masked men who were there.

We, the "Shining Sword," too. There is no doubt that adventurers with a record of being doorkeepers are the culprits, and there are only so many of them.

<blank>

I thought the guys from The Shining Sword were from the Empire?"

No. (I'm) from the Holy Land. （I'm from the Holy Land."

Oh, yes, I did."

<blank>

I, the leader of the guild, responded. This made the interrogation much easier, and the others, who were better spoken, easily slipped through the guildmaster's interrogation.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

But it seems true that the bomb we planted has been disarmed.

This would make it impossible to destroy the dungeon.

<blank>

"Hey, what do we do?　We can't destroy the dungeon with this."

......No choice, let's go set it up again."

We don't have much time before the next new moon, but do you want to wait another month?"

No." A lot will be taken care of next new month. On the contrary, this time it will be quicker."

The people here must not know that the dungeon weakens at the new moon," he said. If so, it would be natural to dive just before the new moon.

<blank>

<blank>

Thus, we decided to dive into a monster-filled dungeon just before the new moon.

<blank>

<blank>

As a result, we had that nightmarish experience.

<blank>

(Next time, a nightmare () experience.

(To be honest, this time I was just stalling for time because I ran out of stock.)
