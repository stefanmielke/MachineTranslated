# Cold-Blooded Agent (Bibei's Perspective)

<b>

<b>

<b>

I am Bibei. The leader of the "Shining Sword" and a mercenary from the Holy Kingdom employed by the Gidrag Empire.

However, I am the only mercenary. The "Shining Sword" consists entirely of agents from the Empire besides me. They are quite strong and, at the same time, loyal to me as their leader.

Being in charge of them made me feel as if I had become a cold-blooded agent myself, which was quite pleasant. I receive a massage once a day, and that also felt very good.

…The only slight dissatisfaction was the lack of women.

<b>

Now, the task assigned to me is the destruction of a dungeon.

<b>

This apparently is necessary to save the world.

Dungeons are evil entities that absorb the world's energy and lead it to ruin.

To protect the world, destroying the dungeon is essential――so they say.

<b>

Upon successfully completing this job, I am promised the title of "Hero" within the Empire and a luxurious lifestyle to match.

<b>

<b>

I infiltrated the Pavelkant Kingdom for this job and gained a position within the Adventurers' Guild.

Everything is for the purpose of destroying the dungeon.

For that reason, I even treated the beastmen kindly. It was truly a struggle.

<b>

<b>

After much effort, I finally succeeded in bringing everyone to the depths of the dungeon the other day.

That said, the core of the dungeon was protected by a barrier.

<b>

"Well then, Cargo. What should we do from here?"

"Ah. Bibei just needs to watch. Migo, Chino."

<b>

The twin brothers, Migo and Chino, took out magical tools together.

They fiddled with the barrier, and it became thin before disappearing.

It seems to be a magical tool that temporarily disables barriers.

<b>

"After that, Joe will set the timed bomb, and that will be it."

"Hah, this is easy. With this, I’m a hero too. …But why aren’t we blowing it up right away?"

"The dungeon is a living thing; there are times when it’s not in good condition. It can’t be destroyed unless it’s the right time. Besides, if we blow it up now, we’ll be buried alive."

"I-I see. Then I guess we have no choice."

<b>

<b>

――So, with that, we were supposed to finish our mission and head back to the Empire after confirming the dungeon was destroyed.

<b>

Yet, that’s when it happened.

<b>

<b>

"Everyone! Listen! A bomb has been planted in the dungeon!"

"What? A bomb!?"

<b>

In the Adventurers' Guild, the Guild Master said such a thing.

<b>

"Hey, hey, we need to escape quickly then!"

"Don’t worry, the bomb has been disarmed. You all! We’re going to find the culprit! It’s suspiciously those from the Empire!"

<b>

Thus, we were first subjected to an interrogation from those present.

We, the "Shining Sword," were included. There was no doubt that the adventurer with the door guard's record was the culprit, and the number of suspects was limited.

<b>

"Were the members of the 'Shining Sword' from the Empire?"

"No. (I am) from the Holy Kingdom."

"Oh, right."

<b>

So I, the leader, answered that way. This made the interrogation significantly easier, and the smooth-talking others easily slipped past the Guild Master's questioning.

<b>

<b>

<b>

However, it seems that the bomb we set was indeed disarmed.

This means we cannot destroy the dungeon.

<b>

"Hey, what do we do? We can’t destroy the dungeon like this."

"…We have no choice; let’s set it up again."

"We don’t have much time until the next new moon; should we wait another month?"

"No. They will take various countermeasures by next month’s new moon. It would actually be quicker this time."

"These folks here probably don’t know that the dungeon weakens during the new moon. If that’s the case, it would be natural to dive in just before the new moon."

<b>

<b>

Thus, we decided to dive into the monster-infested dungeon just before the new moon.

<b>

<b>

As a result, we ended up having that nightmarish experience.

To be honest, I apologize for this being a time filler due to running out of stock!)
