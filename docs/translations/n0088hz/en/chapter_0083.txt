My name is Karina. I returned to Solacidore with two orcs and a goblin's ear on my cart.

No, even two of them are very heavy. Without space magic, you can't carry them even if you have a cart.

If I had to ride all the hunts, I'd break the wagons in plenty of time.

<blank>

So, we delivered to the Adventurer's Guild a proof of defeat of two whole orcs and 30 goblins.

The 30 goblins, including the permanent request to take down the goblins, came to 1 silver coin. Two orcs came to one large silver coin. One orc is worth 5 silver coins, yum.

<blank>

That's a total of 11 silver coins earned.

And I've still got a lot of oaks lying around in my storage space, you know. I wonder how much I could get for a few flushes?

<blank>

What's ......, I feel like you can make more money as an adventurer than as a merchant, don't you?

<blank>

Yo, Karina. You've been hunting orcs solo, ...... the cart okay?"

"Oh, I made it as light as a log, so it's okay, Blade-senpai."

Oh. Can't that thing be used for orcs, too? That's really convenient.

<blank>

Hehe, I'm impressed with Blade Senpai.

Yes, let's quietly explore whether this was not an oak farm.

I ask, pretending to be nonplussed.

<blank>

If you want, we can borrow a cart again and go orc hunting together this time.　There were about 30 orcs gathered there.

"What about ......?　Wait a minute, what did you just say?"

"Oh, I knew it was a bad place to mess with ......?"

"Hey, Sophie, let me borrow your map!　Where did you see those 30?"

<blank>

Braid-senpai borrows a map from the receptionist and spreads it out on the table. I poke my finger at the place where I saw the group of orcs. It was quite deep in the forest.

<blank>

"......, oh, you went that far back!　But I wouldn't be surprised if there were 30 orcs or ...... evolved individuals out there."

Is that a knight or a general?"

If there are 30 of them, I doubt there are any kings out there, but there are likely to be some knights. No, I'm not optimistic if only some of them were seen by Karina. If there are kings out there, we're in trouble.

<blank>

Oh, it was a bad one?　So it was a good one to hunt, apparently. Good.

<blank>

Is it bad?"

'Oh, if they head in the direction of Solacidore, they could destroy the town. Unless we destroy the king, the orcs will keep growing and cause a stampede."

<blank>

Hmmm...I see.

Apparently I've saved the town from a crisis without people knowing about it!

Ah, but let's make sure it's King.

<blank>

"Senpai, senpai. Can I ask you to come to the back?"

What?"　What is it Karina, I'm feeling important ...... Hey, I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this."

I was like, "Well, well, well, well. You and I are friends, aren't we? Let's talk in private. It's not a bad thing.

I'm going to ......, but hey."

<blank>

So, in a back alley near the guild. We came to an unpopular scrap yard.

Then he takes out from his backpack a small oak that seems to be a king. And a crown. I'm glad I brought it just in case.

<blank>

Is this what the King is all about?

"...... oh ......"

<blank>

Braid-senpai puts his hands over his eyes and looks up to the heavens.

<blank>

I'll tell you what, let's go to ...... and see. You know, should I report it to the guild?　My head can't keep up."

"I'm just asking for advice in secret because I'm afraid I'm going to get in trouble!"

I guess."

<blank>

I'm asking for advice because I believe that Braid senior is the one who will think about it.

<blank>

What do you want to do?　You want to be a hero?　You could be a rank-A adventurer."

'I'm a woman, isn't it funny that I'm a hero? ...... joking aside, I'd like to pretend that nothing happened and continue peddling at my leisure. ...... Oh, so that's what I should do."

Hey, you talk to people and don't settle things on your own."

Sometimes ideas come together when you talk to other people, don't they?

<blank>

Yes. We can pretend it never happened. Orc aberrations and the like!

If you secretly thin it out and put it away in a storage space, you can pretend it never happened!

<blank>

And if they find out, they can put all the credit and blame on Mr. Healer!

<blank>

Everyone is happy that the stampede didn't happen, I'm happy to get meat and magic stones, and by the way, I'm happy not to be exposed.

What a perfect solution! It is an amicable solution where everyone is happy except the orcs who are thinned out.

<blank>

<blank>

I mean, are you sure you can handle it?　If there's anything I can do to help, I'll give you a hand."

I'm glad to know that this is a king... Oh, should we thin out the orcs in the forest?　It's dangerous to have a group of about 30 orcs."

'Yes, I think so. If you can, can you do ......?　Can you do it? Yes."

I'll just thin them out. Actually, there were about 100 of them. ......

I guess that's what I mean when I say, "......, I can't keep my mouth shut."

<blank>

Braid senior scratching his head with a crunch.

<blank>

I mean, what the hell. Thanks for saving the town, Karina."

It's not that much to ask.

<blank>

I gave a thumbs-up and a smirk, and Blade-senpai blushed.

Hey, don't fall for it.

<blank>

<blank>

And my statement that I had seen about 30 of them, "If you listen carefully, I think I mistook them for goblins," was never made.

Peace be with you. (except for the peace of the orcs)
