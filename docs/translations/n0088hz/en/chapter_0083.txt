# There are times when talking to someone helps organize your ideas, right?

I'm Karina. I returned to Solashidore with two orcs and a goblin's ear loaded on my cart, puffing and panting.

No, even with just two, it's quite heavy. Without spatial magic, I wouldn't be able to transport this even with a cart.

If I had loaded everything I hunted, the cart would have easily broken.

<b>

So, I delivered the proof of the defeat of two orcs and thirty goblins to the Adventurers' Guild.

Including the permanent hunting request, thirty goblins earned me one silver coin. The two orcs earned me one large silver coin. One orc is worth five silver coins; it's quite a profit.

<b>

That's a total of eleven silver coins earned.

Moreover, there are still a lot of orcs sleeping in my storage space. I wonder how much it would be if I sold them in batches?

<b>

...I wonder, it feels like adventurers can earn more than merchants?

<b>

"Hey, Karina. Did you hunt orcs solo... Was the cart okay?"

"Ah, I made it light like logs, so it's fine, Blade-senpai."

"Oh. Can that be used on orcs too? That's really convenient."

<b>

Blade-senpai looks impressed.

Right, let's subtly probe if this isn't secretly an orc farm.

I pretend to be oblivious and ask.

<b>

"How about borrowing the cart again and going orc hunting together this time? I found a spot where about thirty of them gathered."

"...Huh? Wait a minute, what did you just say?"

"Ah, was it a bad idea to bring it up...?"

"Hey, Sophie, I'm borrowing a map! Where did you see those thirty orcs?"

<b>

Blade-senpai borrows a map from the receptionist and spreads it out on the table. I point to the location where I saw the orc group with my finger. It's quite deep in the forest.

<b>

"...Did you really go that deep!? But thirty orcs... It's not surprising if evolved individuals show up."

"Is that like knights or generals?"

"Yeah. If there are thirty, a king probably hasn't shown up, but there might be knights. No, if what Karina saw was just part of it, we can't be too optimistic. If a king shows up, that's bad news."

<b>

Oh, so it was dangerous? That means it was probably okay to hunt them. Thank goodness.

<b>

"Is it dangerous?"

"Yeah, if they head towards Solashidore, it wouldn't be surprising if the town gets destroyed. Unless we take down the king, the orcs will keep multiplying and cause a stampede."

<b>

Hmm, I see.

It seems I inadvertently saved the town from a crisis!

Oh, but I should confirm if it's really a king.

<b>

"Senpai, senpai. Can you come to the back for a moment?"

"Huh? What is it, Karina? I'm busy with something important... Hey, I'm starting to feel uneasy."

"Come on, come on. We're close, aren't we? Let's have a private talk. It's not a bad story."

"...Fine, but only because it's you."

<b>

So, we went to a back alley near the guild. We arrived at an abandoned materials storage area with no one around.

Then I took out a small orc that seems to be a king from my backpack. And a crown. I'm glad I brought it just in case.

<b>

"Is this the king?"

"...Oh..."

<b>

Blade-senpai puts his hand to his forehead and looks up at the sky.

<b>

"Hey, should we... um, report this to the guild? I'm having trouble processing this."

"I'm secretly consulting you because it seems like a hassle to report it!"

"Yeah, I get that."

<b>

I'm trusting Blade-senpai to think about that part too.

<b>

"What do you want to do? Become a hero? You could even become an A-rank adventurer."

"Isn't it strange for a girl to be a hero? ...Jokes aside, I'd like to just let it go and continue being a traveling merchant... Oh, maybe that's what I should do."

"Hey, don't just solve it on your own after asking me for advice."

"There are times when talking to someone helps organize your ideas, right?"

<b>

Yes. I can just pretend it never happened. The abnormal proliferation of orcs!

If I secretly thin them out and store them in my storage space, it will be as if it never happened!

<b>

And if it gets found out, I can just shift all the blame onto the healer!!

<b>

Everyone will be happy without a stampede, I'll get meat and magic stones, and on top of that, I won't get found out.

What a perfect solution. Everyone except the orcs being thinned out will be happily resolved.

<b>

<b>

"Um, do you think we can manage this? If there's anything I can help with, let me know."

"Just knowing this is a king is enough for meâ€”ah, should I secretly thin out the orcs in the forest? Since it's dangerous with about thirty of them gathered."

"Yeah. If you can... can you do it? I see."

"Then I'll thin them out appropriately. There were actually about a hundred of them..."

"......I see now why people are left speechless."

<b>

Blade-senpai scratches his head vigorously.

<b>

"Um, thanks for saving the town, Karina."

"Not a big deal."

<b>

When I gave a thumbs up and smiled, Blade-senpai's face turned red.

Hey, don't fall for me.

<b>

<b>

And my statement about seeing about thirty orcs was brushed off as "I must have mistaken them for goblins when I listened closely."

Peaceful, and that's what matters. (Except for the peace of the orcs)
