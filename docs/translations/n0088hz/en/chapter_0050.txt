# W-Wait, it's a monster! (Pirate's Perspective)

<b>

<b>

A woman suddenly appeared from inside the ship, breaking through the deck. She was definitely the one who defeated the captain in a drinking contest the other day. Why is she on our ship? Is she a confident magician? But to come out in front of us who were prepared for battle, what bad luck we have―― that was my thought, at least at first.

<b>

“Wooooah!!――Wha!?”

“Oh, is that a mass-produced weakling?”

<b>

As I swung my sword, she effortlessly stopped the blade with just a single finger. That was a sword swung with all the strength of a sea man, and she just touched it with her finger!? Not even a scratch on her finger!?

<b>

“W-W-Whoa!! Fire, fire!!”

“Sure, sure, a pea shooter with low accuracy. But since it doesn't fly straight, it might actually be more troublesome. It would be surprising if it hit your eye.”

<b>

Even as I attacked her with a gun――a weapon that shoots metal bullets through explosions created by alchemy――she remained unfazed. In fact, the bullets that should have hit her vanished without leaving a mark.

She smiled, her mouth curving like a crescent moon.

<b>

What on earth is this? What are we up against!? It was clear that she was not an ordinary human to break through the deck like that!

<b>

<b>

“Hey you guys, don’t panic so much, okay? Let’s have some fun!”

“Wah!”

“My feet slipped, ugh!”

<b>

As we passed by, she casually tripped us as if we were rolling over a tree root. A grown man stumbling over such thin legs.

<b>

“Damn it, burn the enemy in front of us, Flare Cannon!”

“Too sweet. Magic tube!”

<b>

Our ultimate attack was absorbed by her left hand and fired from her right. When it hit and exploded, my comrades were blown away, and a hole opened in the ship. Oh no, it's on fire!

<b>

“Put it out, put it out! Don’t use fire magic on this ship, you idiot!”

“Water, water!”

“Oh dear, this is serious. Let me help you put it out. Poof, it’s gone.”

<b>

When she snapped her fingers, the fire was extinguished.

……What kind of magic is she using!? Without any incantation!

<b>

“Oh, right, right. Can you tell me about the elves? Hey!”

“W-Wait, it's a monster!”

“Eeeek!!”

<b>

Someone appeared, frightened and trying to escape. No, they were probably trying to escape from the beginning.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“What are you doing! This is my ship!!――You bastard!?”

<b>

One of those who fled must have called for him, as Captain Gomez appeared on the deck from a higher bridge.

With bloodshot eyes, Captain Gomez glared at the woman.

<b>

“Hey Gonzales. Or was it Gohandes?”

“It's Gomez, don’t get it wrong, you bastard!――But coming here is your downfall.”

<b>

Captain Gomez licked his lips.

<b>

“Bring out the golem! The combat golem!”

“A golem against a human!?”

“Don’t think of her as human, consider her a monster! The ship is protected by the sea god’s blessing, so use magic freely!”

<b>

The sea god’s blessing. The strongest defense of the artifact “Poseidon” held by Captain Gomez. With this, even if we rammed our ship into another, we wouldn’t break, and even if we hit a reef, the hull wouldn’t get a hole.

In other words, it means absolute safety during the voyage, and it also means that even if a golem rampages on the deck or magic is unleashed, the ship will not be damaged at all.

<b>

“Absolutely don’t let her escape! We need to make her spill the location of our cargo!!”

“Eh? Originally, it seems like it’s our client’s cargo. I can’t return it.”

“C-Client!? You’re the adventurer hired by the owner of that ship to retrieve it!!”

<b>

It happens sometimes. Requests like “Please retrieve the cargo stolen by pirates.”

Most of the time, it’s a matter that can be resolved with money, but this time, the cargo already had a designated recipient. And more importantly, the owner of the cargo was an elf, and it was a good item, so it was sold off quickly.

<b>

However, it seems that there was a prior request stating, “If the cargo is stolen, please retrieve it.” And she came to work diligently, it seems.

<b>

“I’ll pay double the reward! If you switch sides now, I’ll let you go!”

“Eh, no way. I don’t think you guys can pay the reward, and it’s not worth negotiating.”

<b>

The woman easily rejected Captain Gomez’s proposal.

<b>

“Heh, I thought so! But too bad! That elf is probably the lord’s pet by now!”

“Oh, that’s good to know, thank you. Well, I’ll go rescue her later.”

“You fool, there’s no way you can oppose the lord and come out unscathed! You’ll be taken down by us first!”

“Is that so? Well, whatever. Come at me. By the way, while we’re talking, is the golem ready?”

<b>

She seemed to have realized that I was stalling for time to activate the golem…… but she let her guard down. In fact, the sea god’s blessing is effective not only on the golems that are ship’s equipment but also on us, the crew.

<b>

No matter how excellent a magician she is, can she stand against a golem and a combat group protected by the sea god’s blessing? As long as we have the artifact “Poseidon,” we are invincible!
