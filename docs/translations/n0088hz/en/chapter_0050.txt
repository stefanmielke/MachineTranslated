# "Ba, ba-kemon!" (Pirate's point of view) (Pirate's point of view)

<blank>

<blank>

A woman suddenly appeared from inside the ship, crashing through the deck. She was the one who had beaten the captain in a drinking contest the other day. Why is he on our ship?　Is he a wizard with confidence in his skills?　But it was bad luck for her to appear in front of us who were preparing for a battle - that's what I thought at first.

<blank>

Wohraaaaah! What the--?

"Onya, mass-produced namakra, maybe?"

<blank>

He tries to cut at it with his sword, but is stopped by a single finger holding down the blade. This is a sword wielded by a man of the sea with all his might, and all it takes is a light touch of his finger!　You can't even cut the skin off your finger!

<blank>

Wah, wah, wah!　Shoot, shoot!"

Yes, yes, it's a peashooter with low accuracy," he said. But it may be rather troublesome because it doesn't fly straight. If it gets in your eye, you'll be surprised.

<blank>

He attacks the woman with a gun - a weapon made by alchemy that sends metal bullets flying in an explosion - but she is unperturbed. In the first place, the bullet that should have hit her has disappeared, leaving not even a scratch.

A woman smiles with a crescent moon at the edge of her mouth.

<blank>

What the hell is this?　What are we dealing with!　It was obvious that they were no ordinary people to appear through the deck in the first place!

<blank>

<blank>

"Guys, don't be in such a hurry, okay?　Let's have some more fun.

Wow."

"Slippery feet, fugg."

<blank>

If we passed by each other, we could easily put our feet on them and they would roll us over. It was as if a grown man had stumbled over the roots of a big tree against such thin legs.

<blank>

"Damn it, burn up the enemy before you, flare cannon!"

Sweet. Magic tube!"

<blank>

The special attack we unleashed was absorbed by the left hand and released from the right hand. If it lands and explodes, it blows up our friends and leaves a hole in the ship. Oh, man, I'm on fire!

<blank>

Put out the fire, put out the fire!　Don't use fire magic on this boat, you idiot!

Water, water.

Oh, my God. I'll help you put out the fire. Here it goes."

<blank>

The woman snapped her fingers and the fire went out.

...... What the hell kind of magic are you using?　Without even chanting!

<blank>

'Oops, yes, yes. Could you tell me about the elves, please?　Hey."

Bubba, you're a monster!"

Heeeeyyyy!

<blank>

Someone got scared and ran away. No, they were running away or something from the beginning.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell are you doing?　This is my ship! --What the fuck are you doing?

<blank>

Captain Gomez, who must have been summoned by one of these escapees, appeared on deck from the bridge, which was a step higher than the rest of the ship.

With bloodshot eyes, Captain Gomez stares at the woman.

<blank>

"Hi, Gonzalez. Or was it Gohandes?"

It's Gomez, don't get me wrong! --But you've come to the wrong place.

<blank>

Captain Gomez licks his lips.

<blank>

"Give me the golem!　Golem for combat!"

A golem against a human?

He's not a human, he's a monster!　The ship will be protected by the blessing of the sea god, and magic will be used as much as possible!"

<blank>

The blessing of the sea god. It is the strongest defense of "Poseidon," the divine weapon possessed by Captain Gomez. With this, even if a ship and a boat collide, this one will not break, and even if it hits a reef, it will not create a hole in the hull.

This means absolute safety on the voyage, which means that the ship will not be damaged in any way, even if a golem rampages on deck or blasts magic at it.

<blank>

Don't let them get away!　Make them tell us where our cargo is!

What?　It seems to be our client's luggage, after all. I can't return it.

"You're the client?　You're the recovery adventurer commissioned by the owner of that ship!

<blank>

Sometimes we get requests like, 'We need to get back a cargo that was stolen by bandits. Sometimes I get requests like, "I want you to get back the cargo that was stolen by bandits.

Most of the time, this is solved with money, but in this case, the owner of the cargo had already decided who would take it back. And, more importantly, the owner of the cargo was an elf and a good seller, so he was the first to quickly sell it off.

<blank>

But I guess that means that he had asked in advance to get his cargo back if it was taken from him. And he came to work for the law, this guy.

<blank>

I'll pay you double!　I'll forgive you if you turn now!"

No, I don't. I don't think you guys can pay me. I don't think you guys can pay me, and I don't think we deserve to negotiate.

<blank>

The woman easily kicks off Captain Gomez's proposal.

<blank>

Heh, I thought so!　But too bad!　That elf is a lord's pet now!"

That's good to hear. Well, that's good to know, thank you. Well, I'll go help you with that later."

You fool, you'll never get away with it if you challenge the lords!　We'll beat you up before you get away with it!"

I don't know.　Well, no matter. Go ahead and get it. And while we're talking, is the Golem ready?"

<blank>

They knew we were buying time to activate the golem, and they were on board with the story. ...... But they were caught off guard. In fact, the blessing of the sea god is effective for the golem, which is a fixture of the ship, and for us, the crew.

<blank>

No matter how good a magician we are, we are no match for a golem and battle group protected by the blessing of the sea god!　As long as we have the divine weapon "Poseidon," we are invincible!
