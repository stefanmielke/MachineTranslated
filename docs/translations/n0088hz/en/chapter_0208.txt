# They must be making a lot of money.

I went to the waiting room, which was a separate players' waiting room and quite spacious.

There is even a carpet and a bed in the room, which looks like it could be used as a hotel. There are even fruits on the table.

<blank>

Good work, sister."

Thank you for your hard work, Mister Aruji!"

<blank>

So, Dia, it appears that you were included because you are a party member. Aisia is my slave, so I treat her as my property as well.

<blank>

Now, it seems that the main competition starts here, so I'm going to do my best to win!

What was that?　Was that a qualifier earlier?"

I didn't know much about it because I just entered a tournament that looked big enough for me to win, thinking that Aruji-sama could win anything. I didn't know that.

<blank>

It seems I was the only one who qualified, but I'm sure it was because I joined on short notice. All the other participants must have already made it through the qualifying round.

<blank>

...... Well, there are many things you don't know about this kind of thing without someone like a guide, aren't there?

Maybe I should have brought Mr. Masiello even if I had to ask him to come.

<blank>

But all I can do is win!　Even if there's a king or something, I'm going to win!　And I have 82 gold coins at stake."

Yes, I am sure you can beat King Barbaros! I am sure that you will be able to defeat King Barbaros!"

I agree. I am sure your sister will win. But be careful, because I hear that when King Barbaros sees a strong woman, he invites her to become his concubine."

<blank>

I see. I'll have to be careful with that. I'll have to be careful not to let them take you away from me.

Don't let the mysterious beautiful girl, Dia, who won overwhelmingly with her dragons at the tamer competition, be taken away from you!

<blank>

"Well, if you're playing against the king, you have to act like you're weak and win with a lucky punch."

I hope that fools you. ......

If I can't fake it, that's the time to do it. It will be easy for you to get away with it. I'll go to ...... and gather some information in preparation for the next match.

<blank>

I know it's a little late for that, but I think I should ask for .......

Information is important!

<blank>

'Yes, I'll ask for it. Please do me a favor, Isiah."

Yes!　Leave it to me!"

By the way, sis, how many more games do we have to win to win the championship?"

I don't know, but if we beat them all, we win. Yeah."

<blank>

I picked up a piece of fruit that was left in the waiting room. I heard that this kind of service is available for contestants in the finals. This is a nice tournament. They must be making a lot of money. I munched on it.

<blank>

...... sister, that's not poisoned or anything, is it?"

It's okay. I scanned it with spatial magic, but it's just another plain old muskrat."

<blank>

I picked up one of the large grapes and ate it with a crunch. Mmmm, it's sweet. The juice soaks into my throat.

I used spatial magic to cut the red apple into eight pieces, and gave Dia a slice as well.

<blank>

Amu. It's ...... shaky and delicious. These are pretty good ones."

Really?"

Yes, it is. I think it is a luxury item, the kind that is feasted on by royalty and such. ......Maybe there are royalty at the convention. I think that's what they have in the anteroom.

"Aruji-sama, may I have a slice?"

"Okay. Here you go."

<blank>

She brings the apple to Isiah's mouth and eats it with a squeak.

<blank>

I'm sure you'll be able to find it at ....... It's so good!　Master, you should make a copy of this for the pantry!"

I'm not so sure. Well, if you don't sell it, I guess it's okay. Yeah."

"Heh, you can eat all you want of this......After all, Aruji-sama's base is the best......!　And if you eat it with Aruji-sama's hand-grabbing, it's twice as tasty!"

Haha, thanks."

<blank>

Let's get all the Five Elders to eat it. ...... No, they might all be used to eating it. Like Queen Mee or something.

<blank>

I think people would make magical tools to grow these things."

With magical tools,?" ...... Sure, you could do it with the right environment for your base. We don't have to take into account storms, pests, etc."

"Fully automated farm with magical tools...... ants."

<blank>

It's against my personal rules to make from seeds, fruits I got here today, but if I can get good seeds from Mee-chan's contacts, that's possible.

<blank>

"A field in a stronghold... ...... I think we're going to have a country inside the stronghold one of these days."

It would be easy if you wanted to make it, but I wouldn't recommend it because you are too dependent on your sister.

<blank>

And Deere-kun, you answer seriously. If you say so, I'll stop.

I can't take responsibility if I make it that big. I don't want to. And I'm only willing to enclose it to the extent that I can love it.

<blank>

Or, Kalina, the player. Please prepare for the next match!　Oh, this will be the last match of the day!"

<blank>

The staff came to call me.

<blank>

Hmm?"　Oh, it was a two-day tournament, wasn't it? I see.

Yes. Please feel free to use this room today. Win or lose, yes, you are free to use it for the night."

I see. Well, I guess I'll go to ...... for the main game!"

'Well, I'm off to gather information. I'll leave a note via the base as appropriate with the information, so please check back!"

I'll be cheering from the bleachers!"

<blank>

Dea and Isiah left the room as I did.

<blank>

A match?　Well, it's still the first game of the finals!　I won easily.

<blank>
