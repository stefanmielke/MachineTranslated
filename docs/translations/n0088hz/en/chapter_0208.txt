# It must be profitable for sure

<b>

When I went to the waiting room, it was a spacious individual player lounge.

There were carpets and even beds, making it a well-equipped room that seemed suitable for staying overnight like a hotel. There were even light snacks and fruits on the table.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work, big sister."

"Thank you for your hard work, my lord!"

<b>

So, it seems that Dia-kun was allowed in as a party member. Aisia is my slave, so she is treated the same way as property.

<b>

"Alright, it seems like the main event starts from here, so let's do our best to aim for victory!"

"Huh? Was the earlier part the preliminaries?"

"I just randomly entered what seemed like a big tournament, thinking my lord could win anything, so I didn't know the details either. So that was the case."

<b>

It seems that only my group had preliminaries, but it must be because we joined at the last minute. The other participants must have already cleared the preliminaries.

<b>

...Hmm, it's hard to understand these things without a guide.

Maybe I should have insisted on bringing Mashiro-san along.

<b>

"But anyway, what I can do is just win! Even if a king comes out as an opponent, I will definitely show that I can win! After all, there are 82 gold coins at stake!"

"Yes. I'm sure my lord can defeat King Barbaros!"

"That's right. I'm sure you can win, big sister. But please be careful, as it seems King Barbaros invites strong women to be his concubines."

<b>

I see. I need to be careful about that. I mustn't let Dia-kun be taken away.

The mysterious beautiful girl who dominated the Dragon Tamer tournament and achieved overwhelming victory, I must not let them take Dia-kun away!!

<b>

"Hmm, when facing a king, I should pretend to be weak and win with a lucky punch, right?"

"I hope that can work..."

"If it doesn't work, then it doesn't. My lord would probably find it easy to escape... Shall we gather some information just in case for the next matches?"

<b>

It feels a bit late for that... but maybe it's better to ask.

Information is important after all!

<b>

"That's right, I'll ask you to do that. Please, Aisia."

"Yes! Leave it to me!"

"By the way, big sister, how many matches do I need to win to become the champion?"

"I don't know, but well, if you defeat everyone, you'll be the champion. Yeah."

<b>

I picked up a piece of fruit that was placed in the waiting room. It seems there are services like this for main event participants. What a nice tournament. It must be profitable for sure. Munch munch.

<b>

"...Big sister, this doesn't have any poison in it, right?"

"Don't worry. I scanned it with spatial magic, and this is just regular muscat."

<b>

I plucked a large one and took a bite. Hmm, sweet. The juice spreads down my throat.

I used spatial magic to cut a red apple into eight pieces and gave a slice to Dia-kun.

<b>

"Nom. ...It's crunchy and delicious. This is quite a good one."

"Is that so?"

"Yes. I think it's a high-quality item served to royalty. ...Perhaps there are royals participating in the tournament. The fruits in the waiting room might be leftovers from them."

"My lord, could I have a piece too?"

"Sure. Here, ahh."

<b>

When I fed it to Aisia, she crunched into the apple.

<b>

"...It's, it's so delicious! My lord, this is something we should copy and store in the food storage!"

"Is it that good? Well, if I'm not selling it, then it's fine. Yeah."

"Yay, an all-you-can-eat feast... My lord's base is the best...! And having eaten it directly from my lord's hand makes it even more delicious!"

"Ahaha, thanks."

<b>

I should let everyone from the Five Elders taste it too... No, they might be used to it. After all, there's Queen Mi-chan.

<b>

"If it's everyone, they might create magical tools to grow things like this."

"With magical tools, huh? ...Indeed, if we utilize the environment of the base well, it seems possible. We wouldn't have to worry about storms or pests."

"An entirely automated farm with magical tools... That sounds good."

<b>

If I were to grow it from seeds, using the fruits I got today would be a personal rule violation, but if I could get good seeds through Mi-chan's connections, then that would be acceptable.

<b>

"A farm at the base... It seems like a country could be established within the base soon."

"It would be easy to create if we wanted to, but since there's a tendency to rely too much on big sister, I wouldn't recommend it."

<b>

Dia-kun answered seriously. If Dia-kun says so, then I should refrain.

If I make it that big, I won't be able to take responsibility. I don't want to take responsibility. I only want to enclose it to the extent that I can be adored.

<b>

"K-Karina-san. Please prepare for the next match! Ah, this will be the last match of the day!"

<b>

The staff came to call me.

<b>

"Huh? Ah, so it was a tournament split over two days. I see, I see."

"Yes. Please feel free to use this room today. Whether you win or lose, you can use it freely for the night."

"I see. Well then, I'm off... to the main event!"

"Then I will go gather information. I will leave notes through the base as needed, so please check them!"

"I'll be cheering from the audience!"

<b>

Dia-kun and Aisia also left the room along with me.

<b>

A match? Well, it's still the first match of the main event! I won easily.
