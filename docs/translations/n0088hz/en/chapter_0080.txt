# The new magic tool car, the element of the setting

<blank>

I think it's time to get my act together to go to the dungeon.

<blank>

Dia-kun had collected information from Braid-senpai, and we learned that there is a dungeon in a town called Carcassa. It would take more than a month to get there on foot.

<blank>

I think I'm going to get tired of just hanging out at home for that long."

<blank>

It is a very cumbersome process, pretending to have moved.

Let's buy a ...... horse-drawn carriage. I don't know how many gold coins it would cost including the horse.

I wish I had a car at least. ......

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, yeah, that's right. We can build a car."

<blank>

Cars. Since there is a Golem, there should be a car like that.

If you had a car, you might be able to say that you traveled in three days over a distance that would take a month to cover on foot. It would cost a lot of money for fuel. ...... No, you don't actually have to spend it.

<blank>

However, we need to buy as much as Carina Shonin can cover - or even this to some extent if we pretend to have borrowed money from Mr. Dear.

I also returned one gold coin for buying a slave and I think I can get an additional loan.

<blank>

'All right, once we've decided that, we'll build the car, Dear!　And Isiah, help me!"

"What? Suddenly?"

I'm not sure, but I understand!"

<blank>

Oops, I guess I should explain properly.

First, we need to procure wood as the main material. We can get this from the mountains at the site of the former alchemy kingdom. It is free. The wood must be dried before it can be used, but that can be done in an instant with spatial magic. The strength of spatial magic is that it can repair cracks caused by rapid drying.

<blank>

For now, it should be in the form of a cart, and it should be able to run automatically. It should be fast and controllable.

<blank>

Here's the new magic tool vehicle that I made just like that!

<blank>

With a bang, he showed them a wooden three-wheeled cart. It looked like a retro three-wheeled truck. The front wheels were like bicycle handlebars, allowing the driver to change direction with ease. There are no brakes yet.

<blank>

What is this, a wizard wheel?　There's no horse golem, no magic circle of any kind."

<blank>

Ah, so there are those who let a horse-shaped golem pull a carriage. Heh.

<blank>

If there's a golem that you can get into, there should be a car golem, so I don't know.

<blank>

I think it's not surprising that the Japanese, who built public bathhouses and such, would even build an engine for magical tools. But let's leave aside the "demonma". But, you hesitate to develop it in an erotic way, don't you?　No, no, no, no. The comma is just a massage device, so it's not erotic.

<blank>

It's probably a matter of piloting skills and compatibility. If the traditional golem can be used without modification and the carriage can be operated without modification, a horse golem would be better than a horse that you have to ride in and drive."

<blank>

And running a horse golem with magic stones costs more money than a real horse, he said. It's all about fuel efficiency.

<blank>

Does it work in the first place?

I'll actually work my magic. Like this, swish."

"Oh, did you run ......?　Did you?"

<blank>

I use spatial magic to make the body float 3mm and make it run. In addition, I also try to slide it with the highest speed. ...... This maximum speed is likely to make mincemeat inside if I ride it. It will be necessary to protect the inside with space magic.

<blank>

I'm very fast ......!　But I feel something strange, sir."

I'm just moving it around. It's like moving a box back and forth in your hand."

<blank>

More to the point, it is like moving a miniature car by hand.

Yes. It doesn't have to be really practical as a magic tool vehicle.

<blank>

Under development!　A prototype that eats energy foolishly, without regard to profitability!　A prototype that eats energy without regard to profitability!

The point is, I use this to move around, so it's fast!　The point is that we use this to move around, so it's fast!

Will we lose money on fuel?　Yes, but the aristocratic sponsors will pay for it, so it's not Carina Shonin's place to get involved!

<blank>

So I want you two to modify this to look like a magical tool. Or at least the heart of it."

I see, it doesn't have to be real. I think even I can manage that now. All I have to do is think of a mechanism, a device, or a magic circle that looks like that, right?"

I'm not sure I want to do that. I can think of something to make it really work. Like a piston engine."

Sister, tell me more about that!

'Let's see, there's internal combustion engines. Cranks and heat sinks and stuff. ......"

<blank>

I'll give you a quick rundown of the concept of the engine from the piston. I don't know the details either.

<blank>

Well, Mister Aruji, what can I do to help you with this? What am I supposed to help you with?　I don't know anything about magical tools.

I'd like to see a fake engine. I was wondering if we could bluff ...... the fake engine - the heart of it - by incorporating a design that looks like it comes from some kind of speedy source. I'm not sure how to go about it with a bard's sense of style."

<blank>

In order to claim that this is a magical tool, the heart alone needs to be cool enough to show at first glance that it is a great thing. Of course, it is unlikely to show that much.

<blank>

'Yes, sir, I will discuss this with Mr. Dear and see what I can do!

<blank>

Yeah, yeah, good luck with that.

I give them parchment paper, ink, and a pen. They are allowed to use reproductions because they are for design purposes.

<blank>

I'm going to go to Carcassa to do some market research on what to bring with me when I go peddling. I'll do some stocking up, too.

"Yes, have a good day, sister."

Aruji-sama, you can count on me to stay at home!"

<blank>

Yeah, I don't really need a watch. It's a space that people can't come in and out of without my permission, and I don't get guests. And I didn't end up doing anything to get some kind of lodging and put a door there.

Oh, I also need to buy materials for massage equipment, including a denma. Hmph.
