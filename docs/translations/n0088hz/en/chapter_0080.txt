# New Type of Magical Tool Vehicle, Setting Prototype

<b>

I think it's about time to take action to go to the dungeon.

<b>

Dea-kun has been gathering information from Blade-senpai, and we've learned that there is a dungeon in a town called Karkassa. Apparently, it would take more than a month to walk there.

<b>

"Honestly, getting bored just lounging at home for that long would be a drag."

<b>

It's very troublesome to pretend to have moved.

...Maybe I should just buy a carriage. I don't know how many gold coins it would cost, including the horse.

At least if I had a car...

<b>

<b>

"Oh, right. I can just make a car."

<b>

A car. Since there are golems, it should be possible to have such a vehicle.

If I have a car, I could say I traveled a distance that would take a month on foot in three days. There would be fuel costs, though... No, actually, I could just avoid those.

<b>

That said, I need to buy it within the budget that Karina Shonin can manage—no, I could just say I borrowed from Dea-kun, and that should be fine to some extent.

I've already paid back the one gold coin for buying a slave, so it wouldn't be a problem to take out additional loans.

<b>

"Alright, if that's settled, I'll make the car, Dea-kun! Aisia, help me out!"

"Uh, what’s this all of a sudden?"

"I don't really understand, but I got it!"

<b>

Oh, I need to explain properly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

First, I need to procure the main material, wood. I can probably cut it down from the mountains in the ruins of the Alchemy Kingdom. It’s free. I can't use it until it’s dried, but that can be done in an instant with spatial magic. The advantage of spatial magic is that even if it cracks during rapid drying, I can fix it.

<b>

For now, I’ll shape it like a cart, and it would be great if it could run automatically. It should be reasonably fast and able to be steered.

<b>

"And here is the prototype of the new type of magical tool vehicle I've made!"

<b>

Ta-da! What I showed to the two of them was a wooden three-wheeled cart. Its appearance resembled a retro three-wheeled truck. The front wheels were designed like a bicycle handle, allowing for some degree of steering. There were no brakes yet.

<b>

"This is the magical tool vehicle? There are no horse golems or magic circles at all."

<b>

Oh, there is a golem that can pull a cart. Interesting.

<b>

"If there are golems that can ride, then it wouldn't be strange to have vehicle-type golems too. I wonder about that."

<b>

I think a Japanese person who made a public bath could also create an engine for a magical tool. Leaving Denmark aside. But developing something in a lewd direction feels a bit hesitant, right? No, no, Denmark is just a massage device, so it's not lewd.

<b>

"It’s probably an issue of operating skills and compatibility. If the traditional coachman can use it as is, and the cart can be operated as is, then a horse golem would be better than riding in it."

<b>

And moving a horse golem with a magic stone costs more than a real horse. It’s a fuel efficiency issue.

<b>

"Can it even move, though?"

"It actually moves with my magic. Like this, swoosh."

"Oh, it ran... did it?"

<b>

I levitate the prototype 3mm with spatial magic and make it run. I also try sliding it at maximum speed. ...At that speed, it feels like I would be minced inside if I were riding it. Internal protection with spatial magic would be essential.

<b>

"It’s incredibly fast...! But it feels kind of strange, Master."

"Well, I'm the one moving it. It's like moving a box in my hand back and forth."

<b>

To put it another way, it's like moving a toy car with my hand.

Yes. It doesn’t really need to be practically usable as a magical tool vehicle.

<b>

It’s just a prototype in development! A trial product that disregards profitability and consumes a lot of energy! 

In short, I just need to be able to say, "I’m using this to move quickly!"

Running at a loss due to fuel costs? Yes, but a noble sponsor will cover it, so it’s not something Karina Shonin needs to worry about!

<b>

"So, I want you two to modify this to look like a magical tool. At least the core part."

"I see, it doesn’t need to be real. Then I think I can manage with what I have now. I just need to come up with some mechanisms, devices, and magic circles that look the part, right?"

"Yeah. You can even think of it as actually moving. Like a piston engine."

"Miss, I'm familiar with that!"

"Well, there’s something called an internal combustion engine. It has cranks and heat sinks..."

<b>

I casually explain the concept of an engine based on pistons. I don’t know the details myself.

<b>

"Um, Master. What should I help with? I don’t know anything about magical tools."

"Aisia, assist Dea-kun. ...Like, for the fake engine—the mock heart part, I want to incorporate some design that looks fast and impressive. Can you use your bard's sense to make it work?"

<b>

To insist that this is a magical tool, it’s necessary for the heart part to have a coolness that immediately conveys, "This is something amazing." Of course, it’s unlikely to be shown that much.

<b>

"Understood! I’ll consult with Dea and give it a try!"

<b>

Yes, yes, do your best.

I hand them parchment, ink, and pens. Since it’s for design, using replicas is fine.

<b>

"Alright, I’m going to do some market research on what to take with me when I go to Karkassa for trade. Maybe I’ll do some purchasing too."

"Okay, have a good trip, Miss."

"Master, leave the watching over to me!"

<b>

Yes, I don’t really need a watch. Since it’s a space where no one can enter or exit without my permission, no guests will come. In the end, I haven’t set up a door there, despite all the fuss about getting an inn.

Oh, I also need to buy materials for massage devices, starting with Denmark. Hehehe.
