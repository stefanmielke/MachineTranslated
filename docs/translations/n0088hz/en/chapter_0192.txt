# Where shall I go next?

<b>

I’m Karina! A divine messenger on a mission to collect sacred artifacts (and some clothing)!

The other day, I successfully retrieved a sacred artifact in the dwarf country of Tesshin. Now, where shall I go next?

I was warned by the deity that “unused sacred artifacts” don’t have much appeal, so I intend to aim for the ones that are actually in use.

<b>

“Should I go to the beastman country, Terrarialby, next… or maybe to the Gidlargha Empire?”

<b>

If I consider nearby countries, the beastman country Terrarialby comes to mind. It’s positioned like a perfect triangle connecting Tesshin and the adventurer town of Calcutta. I also want to see the bunny-eared Siesta.

The Gidlargha Empire seems to have sacred artifacts being used for some shady purposes. They seem to be involved in various underhanded dealings with other countries, so there’s potential there.

<b>

Or I could simply go to Dia-kun’s hometown for sightseeing.

Now then, what should I do? Maybe I’ll just roll a die to decide.

<b>

<b>

Just then, Mashiro-san was there, so I decided to consult her.

<b>

“Oh. Then you should go to Terrarialby. Didn’t we talk about the Coliseum?”

“Now that you mention it, there was that talk about the Coliseum.”

“I want to earn some money to pay the Five Elders, so I need you to go out and win. I’ll bet all my money on you. Apparently, they can’t see through your abilities at a glance, so you’ll definitely be a dark horse!”

<b>

What is that, a boyfriend trying to earn money through gambling?

…It’s a little thrilling!

<b>

“If you win and make a profit, I’ll treat Karina to a meal too. Sounds good, right?”

“Ugh… you always do this, making me do dangerous things! What if I lose?”

“Come on, there’s no way you’ll lose. And what’s with that tone?”

“Wow, I feel trusted.”

<b>

Sorry, I was just playing around with a DV boyfriend and his girlfriend. I don’t know, just imagining.

<b>

“You sometimes do things that make no sense, you know?”

“Let’s say it’s just for fun?”

“If you think I can keep up with your fun 100%, you’re dead wrong!”

<b>

That’s true. If Mashiro-san could completely keep up with my Japanese-style fun, then she’d be a reincarnated person or something.

<b>

Then, I suddenly became curious about something.

<b>

“...By the way, is there a system in the Coliseum where the winner can do whatever they want with the loser?”

“Hm? There are tournaments with those kinds of rules. Given the content, I can’t show it to kids, though.”

“...Oh ho!”

“Wait, are you actually planning to participate in that kind of thing?”

<b>

Mashiro-san looked at me with a scrutinizing gaze.

No, but you see. If I humiliate the defeated opponent while stripping off their socks, the deity would be overjoyed.

Even without the sacred artifacts, I’d receive SP from the deity for offering socks.

<b>

“...You’re not planning to lose on purpose and get pinned down, are you?”

“What’s that? There’s no way I’d do something like that.”

<b>

I have no intention of letting some guy do whatever he wants with this body, especially if it’s Mashiro-san.

<b>

“Those kinds of tournaments do pay quite a bit for fights, but if you lose, you’re basically out. Don’t lose on purpose.”

“Wait, are the gladiators in the Coliseum employed somewhere?”

“There are often gladiatorial slaves… but being out means you lose your head and die.”

<b>

Ah, so that’s what it means.

It’s not just the erotic aspect that kids can’t see; there’s also the gory part. I understand now.

<b>

<b>

Thus, my next destination was decided to be the beastman country, Terrarialby.
