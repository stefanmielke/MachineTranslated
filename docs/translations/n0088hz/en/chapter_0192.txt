# Where shall we go next?

<blank>

I, Karina-chan!　A messenger of God with a mission to retrieve divine artifacts (and some clothing)!

The other day we successfully recovered the sacred artifact in Tessin, the land of the dwarves. Now, where shall we go next?

God has warned me that "unused sacred artifacts" that can be recovered peacefully and easily are not very profitable, so I am determined to go for sacred artifacts that are in good use.

<blank>

After Tessin, should we go to Terra Realby, the land of the beastmen, ...... or to the Gidlaga Empire?"

<blank>

Another nearby country is Terra Realby, the land of the beastmen. If you connect Tessin and Carcassa, a town for adventurers, you can form an equilateral triangle. I would like to see a siesta with bunny ears.

The Gidlaga Empire is the one that seems to have a sacred artifact that it is using to do all sorts of nefarious things. They seem to be doing a lot of dark things to other countries, and that's promising.

Or you could simply go to Deere's hometown as a tourist.

Now, what shall we do?　I think I'll just roll the dice and decide.

<blank>

<blank>

And just then, Mr. Masilo was there, so I asked him for advice.

<blank>

Oh. Then make it terra real bee. We talked about the Coliseum, remember?"

I've heard that story before. The Coliseum."

I want to earn money to pay my five elder sisters, so please go out and win. I'll bet all my money on you. They don't know what you're capable of, and I'm sure you'll be a big favorite to win.

<blank>

What's with that gambling boyfriend kind of remark.

...... makes me cringe a little!

<blank>

If I win and make money, I'll buy dinner for Karina, too. You know what I mean?

You always make me do such nasty things!　What are you going to do if I lose?

No, there's no way you're going to lose. And what's with that tone?"

"Wow, they trust me."

<blank>

Sorry, I was just playing DV boyfriend and his girlfriend goggle. I don't know. Imagine.

<blank>

"You know, sometimes you do crazy shit, man."

What can I say, I'm just going with the flow?"

If you think I can keep up 100% with your groove, you're wrong, okay?"

<blank>

That's right. If you could follow my Japanese groove completely, it would mean that you are a reincarnated person or something.

<blank>

And then I suddenly realized something.

<blank>

...... By the way, does the Coliseum have a system where the winner can do whatever they want to the loser?"

Hmm?"　There is a tournament with such rules. But I can't show them to kids because of the content.

"...... Hoho!"

"Hey, wait a minute. You're not going out?　You're going to be in something like that?"

<blank>

Mr. Masiello looks at me with jittery eyes.

No, because, you see. God would be overjoyed if you take off your socks while humiliating the person you've beaten.

Even without the sacred artifact or whatever, if I offer a sock, God gives me SP, me.

<blank>

"...... you don't want to lose on purpose and get pushed around, do you?"

What's that? I would never do that."

<blank>

I don't care if it's Masilo, I'm not going to let some bastard do what he wants with my body.

<blank>

In such tournaments, you get a lot of fight money, but basically, if you lose, you're fired. Don't lose on purpose.

Hey, are the gladiators at the Coliseum employed somewhere?"

Gladiatorial slaves are common, but ...... fired means you'll get your head dropped and die."

<blank>

Ahhh, that way.

It's not only pornography that can't be shown to children, but also grotesqueness. That makes sense.

<blank>

<blank>

Thus, my next destination was decided to be Terra Realby, the land of the beastmen.
