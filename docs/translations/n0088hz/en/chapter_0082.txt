# What's up? Is today bonus day?

<b>

I'm Karina-chan. I love pancakes!

If you ask me what my favorite food is in this world, I'll happily say pancakes and meat! Kya!

Balance 995 SP. Don't say things like "Don't buy pancake mix!"

<b>

Yes.

When I pressed the "Purchase" button in the paper catalog with my finger, pancake mix was delivered to my storage space. The delivery-only storage space has increased on its own.

It's an express delivery that would surprise even some online shopping sites.

<b>

...Moreover, as a bonus, a small amount of eggs and milk were included. I'm a bit happy.

<b>

<b>

So, with one souvenir ready, I also bought some materials for a massage device with the five silver coins I earned from selling the massage device. Ink and varnish. The ink is a small jar for three silver coins, and the varnish is about the size of a sake bottle for two silver coins. Yay, Shonin-chan's earnings have beautifully disappeared.

<b>

It's good that I decided to use the healer's earnings for living expenses. It's fine to cover food and sock costs from there, right? Let's just say it's okay.

<b>

Of course, I can't make magical tools with just ink and varnish. So, for the slightly lacking materials, wood and magic stones, I plan to go hunting monsters to gather them.

I hear that hunting goblins can yield small magic stones.

<b>

"By the way, small magic stones are cheap. If I'm going to break them anyway, I should have used the high-quality large magic stones for golems instead..."

<b>

The magic stones for golems are said to be from relatively high-rank magical beasts. (They are magical beasts that B-rank adventurers mainly deal with, and C-rank parties can barely fight them.)

Well, I could also use spatial magic to combine small magic stones into a large one.

Having a large magic stone would be just right for bluffing as fuel for a vehicle...

<b>

<b>

Well, for now, I'll go gather materials for magical tools. This is also procurement.

<b>

I left town with my adventurer's guild certificate.

When I headed to the forest where I did some lumberjacking with spatial magic, there were quite a few magical beasts and trees I could cut down. Let's go hunting monsters along with basic knowledge.

<b>

Oh, a caterpillar. A big worm. Gross. But it seems to be a beneficial insect, or rather a beneficial magical beast, that eats tree branches like thinning... It's harmless if I don't attack, so I'll leave it alone.

Oh, a goblin. This one is a standard target I can hunt. The proof of defeat is its ears. I also got a small magic stone.

Oh, a slime. Well, I'll take the core. It's a little pocket money. Apparently, there's a magic stone that looks like a grain of sand inside the core, but collecting it isn't worth the effort even for me, who can use spatial magic, so I'll deliver it as is.

Oh, an orc. A bipedal humanoid pig. It's a harmful beast that attacks people, but if I can defeat it, I can get meat and magic stones from it, making it a two-for-one type of magical beast. For me, it's just a bonus. Thanks for the meal.

<b>

Oh! An orc general. I don't know where it got its decorations, but it's wearing some. It's about twice the size of a normal orc. This is where I can get magic stones for golems. Thanks for the meal.

I've heard the meat is delicious too, with a strong magical flavor. Today, it's decided: orc general steak.

<b>

Oh! Another orc general. What's up? Is today bonus day? Yum yum.

By the way, the decorations and equipment that magical beasts have seem to be either ones they made themselves for intelligence appeal or ones from adventurers they defeated. They sell for a decent price, so I'll collect them.

<b>

Oh, an orc knight. It's not as high-ranking as the general, but it should be just right for the magic stones for magical tools. It's also a nice souvenir for dear-kun.

Oh, a goblin shaman is with it too. It drops a larger magic stone than usual for a goblin. Well, it's about the same as an orc. It doesn't drop meat and is more troublesome and less tasty since it uses magic attacks. I'll just take the magic stone and ears. Oh, the decorative tooth necklace might sell at the adventurer's guild.

<b>

<b>

"After that, I just need to cut down some trees and take them home, and my tasks will be done, huh?"

<b>

When I cut down a random tree, it fell with a "Gyuah!" sound. ...Was that a treant? Well, a treant is still wood. In fact, it's high-quality wood, and I can get magic stones from it, so it's just right as a material for magical tools. This is also a delicious target.

<b>

One more... Oh, is this one also a treant? Delicious.

<b>

Oh, an orc archer. It's said to be troublesome because it uses a bow and arrow, but it's just a normal orc holding a bow and arrow. Apparently, its magic stone is a bit larger than a regular orc's, but I can't tell. Since I have the chance, I'll take the bow and arrow. ...Hey, this is pretty well made, isn't it? How cheeky for an orc.

<b>

Oh, an orc assassin. Ambushes are fine, but they won't work on me. By the way, it's impressive that a giant orc can move silently in the forest. I wonder if it has some skills; I'd like to know. And the knife is well made, so I'll take it.

<b>

Oh, a group of goblins. Just give me the magic stones and ears. Here you go. Easy pickings.

Huh? They had something old-looking that looked like a crest. It might be useful for design reference in the future, so I'll take it.

<b>

And another orc. ...An orc? No, I can't tell. It's small, so it might be a baby orc.

Did it put a crown on its head and play king? I feel a bit guilty.

...Huh? The magic stone is unusually large. Could it really be a king? Basic knowledge didn't catch that, huh?

Basic knowledge, you really miss those things. Well, that's what makes it cute, I guess?

<b>

Oh, there are a lot of orcs...

<b>

<b>

"Wait, there are a lot of orcs. No, aren't there too many orcs? Just because they're orcs."

<b>

There must be at least a hundred... I can't count them all.

Hah. Could it be that this area is an orc farm? Oh no, I might have poached. ...Keep quiet. I didn't know!

I can hunt enough orcs to not worry about meat for a few months, so I'll stop here and not get too close. ...There's a possibility they were breeding kings like beekeeping. Orc meat is delicious.

<b>

...I'll only report the defeat of normal orcs and goblins to the adventurer's guild!
