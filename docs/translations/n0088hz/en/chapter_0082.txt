# What's up, is today bonus day?

<blank>

I'm Karina. I love pancakes!

A girl who, when asked what is her favorite food in this life, responds with pancakes and meat!　Kyapi!

Balance 995 sp. Don't buy pancake mix!　I'm not buying pancake mix!

<blank>

Yes.

I pressed my finger hard on the "Buy" section of the paper catalog, and the pancake mix was delivered to my storage space. The storage space dedicated to the delivery has increased on its own.

Same-day delivery on an express delivery service, a surprise even to certain mail-order sites.

<blank>

...... and a small amount of eggs and milk were also served. I was a little happy.

<blank>

<blank>

So now I have one souvenir, and with the 5 silver coins from the massage equipment sales, I bought some materials for the massage equipment that I can't seem to get for myself. Ink and varnish. The ink was a hand-glue sized jar for 3 silver coins, and the varnish was about the size of a bottle of sake for 2 silver coins. Wow, Shaunin-chan's earnings are gone.

<blank>

I'm glad we have a policy of using the healer's profits for living expenses. I can pay for food and socks out of that, right?　Let's say it's good.

<blank>

Of course, ink and varnish are not enough to make magical tools. So, I am going to go hunting for wood and magic stone, materials that are a bit lacking.

If you hunt goblins and such, it seems you can get magic stones and such, although they are small.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a small magic stone, but if it's a small magic stone, it's cheap. If I was going to crush it anyway, I should have used that one instead of the big, superior magic stone for the golem. ......

<blank>

It seems that the demon stones for golems are demon stones of a reasonably high rank demon. (I hear that it is a demon of a level that can just barely be fought by a C-rank party, which is mainly handled by B-rank adventurers.)

Well, I could use spatial magic to attach small magic stones and make them into huge magic stones.

A giant magic stone might be just the thing to bluff as fuel for the car. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Well, for now, let's go and harvest materials for magical tools. This is also stocking up.

<blank>

The Adventurer's Guild certificate took me out of town.

If you go to the forest where I did the lumberjack with spatial magic, there are some demons and trees that can be cut down in a certain way. Let's hunt for demons together with basic knowledge.

<blank>

Oh, it's a caterpillar. A big caterpillar. It's disgusting. But it seems to be a beneficial insect, or rather a beneficial monster, that eats tree branches like thinning ......, so if it doesn't attack, it's harmless, so I leave it alone.

Oh, goblins. This one is the standard one you can hunt. The proof of defeat is an ear. We also got a small magic stone.

Oh, it's slime. Well, I'll take the core. I'll make some extra money. Actually, I heard that there are magic stones like grains of sand in the core, but collecting them is not worth the effort even for me who can use spatial magic, so I'll deliver the core as it is.

Oh, it's an orc. A humanoid pig that walks on two legs. It is a vermin that attacks people, but if you can defeat it, you can get meat and magic stone. It's just a bonus for me, of course. Gochisu!

<blank>

Oh!　It's the Oak General. I don't know where he got it, but he is wearing an ornament. It is about two times larger than a normal orc. I guess you can get magic stones for golems from these things. Thanks for the drink.

I hear the meat is good, too, with a strong magical flavor. I guess I'll be deciding on Oak General Steak today.

<blank>

Oh!　Oak General again. What's today, bonus day?　Yummmm.

Incidentally, the ornaments and equipment that the demons have are said to have been made by the adventurers who made them or returned them with an appeal to their intelligence. They can be sold at a reasonable price, so I'll collect them.

<blank>

Oh, orc knight. It's less prestigious than a general, but it's just right for a magical stone for magical tools. It's also a good souvenir for Dia-kun.

Oh, the goblin shaman is with him. I can get a big magic stone for a goblin. Well, they are just as good as orcs. But they can't get meat, and they attack with magic, so they are more troublesome and tasteless than orcs. I'll take only the magic stone and ears. Oh, I might be able to sell the tusk necklace as an ornament at the adventurer's guild.

<blank>

<blank>

"Now all I have to do is cut down a few random trees and take them home, and my business is done, hmm?"

<blank>

When he quickly cut down a suitable tree, it fell with a "Gyuar! and it fell down. Was it ...... Trent? Well, Trent is still wood. It is rather a good wood, and since it also yields magic stone, it is a good material for magic tools. This is also a tasty opponent.

<blank>

Another bottle of ...... Oops, is this guy a torrent too?　That's delicious.

<blank>

Oh, it's an orc archer. I heard that they are troublesome because they use bows and arrows, but it's just an ordinary Orc with a bow and arrow. I heard that their magic stone is a bit bigger than normal Orcs, but I don't know. I'll take the bow and arrow. ...... Hey, this is pretty good, isn't it?　You're a cheeky Orc.

<blank>

Oh, orc assassin. Surprise attack is good, but it doesn't work on me. I mean, it's amazing how a huge orc can move around in the woods without making a sound. I wonder if they have any skills, you might want to teach me. And I'll take the knife because it's well made.

<blank>

Oh, goblin group. Give me the magic stone and ears for now. Yes, sir. Zakkozakko.

Hmm?　It's old, but you had something that looked like a coat of arms. I'll take it for future design reference.

<blank>

And another oak. ...... orcs?　No I don't know. I think it's a child oak because it's small.

I wonder if he was playing king with a crown on his head. I feel a little guilty.

...... Hmmm?　What's with the big magic stone? Could it really be the King? I didn't understand the basic knowledge.

Basic Knowledge, you are missing that part. Well, that's what's cute about you, isn't it?

<blank>

Oh, what a lot of orcs: ......

<blank>

<blank>

What's with all the orcs? No, there are many orcs, aren't there?　Only because they are orcs.

<blank>

I'm sure there must be 100 of them. ...... I can't even count them.

Ha. Maybe this area was an oak farm or something? Oh man, I think I might have poached it. ...... Shut up. I had no idea!

I've hunted enough orcs to have no trouble finding meat for a few months, and this is about as close as I'm going to get. It's possible that he was taming kings like ...... beekeeping to increase his population. Tasty orc meat.

<blank>

I'll report to the ...... Adventurers' Guild only regular orcs and goblins taken down!
