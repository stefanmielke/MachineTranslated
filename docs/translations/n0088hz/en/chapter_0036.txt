# Drinking Contest (Pirate's Perspective) 2

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I'll drink the alcohol you brought. You'll drink the alcohol I brought. How about that?"

"Yeah, that sounds good? Alright, Master. Judge us."

<b>

The young girl readily accepts my proposal.

Fool, the master here is at my beck and call. If she spills even a drop, he won't recognize it as a full drink.

<b>

Moreover, I was able to naturally bring the competition to one where I drink a weaker alcohol and she drinks a stronger one. Well, I was drinking first, so it’s just right, isn’t it? It's her fault for not noticing.

<b>

Hehehe, the outcome of the contest was decided before it even began!

<b>

<b>

"Alright, first cup. Cheers!"

"Yeah!"

<b>

I gulp down the alcohol. --- Huh, this isn't bad at all. It's probably good alcohol for women and children, but it's too weak for me and not satisfying.

<b>

"Ahh, I want a refill!"

"Me too. Refill!"

<b>

The young girl also tips her mug back and drinks.

Not bad, she's got a good drinking style, no wonder she suggested a drinking contest.

<b>

But you will never win against me!

That was decided from the very beginning, the moment you challenged me!

<b>

<b>

"Ahh, mmm. Wine really does have a nice aroma."

"Hah, the alcohol you brought is crap, I can't get drunk at all."

"...Hey, can you say that in front of a dwarf?"

"? Why is a booze nut coming up?"

"That’s the alcohol bought from a dwarf merchant, you know?"

<b>

...So it’s alcohol sourced from dwarves. No wonder it’s good.

There’s no way it’s related to that alcohol fiend, right? There’s no way this young girl would have anything to do with him.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, I keep drinking.

<b>

Ugh. Even with weak alcohol, my stomach is starting to feel full.

I mean, this girl is chugging the wine like it’s water...!

<b>

"Hey, refill!"

"…Refill."

<b>

It’s about time the alcohol starts to hit and I can’t taste anything anymore—now! Go! I signal my subordinate. It’s alcohol laced with sleeping pills.

My secret to always winning in drinking contests. That’s right, this alcohol with sleeping pills!

<b>

"Cheers!"

"Yeah, cheers!"

<b>

The young girl raises her drink and gulps it down in one go.

Unaware that there are drugs mixed in that alcohol...!

<b>

<b>

"Ahh! ...Huh? What? You should drink faster too. Hurry up."

"...Heh, don’t rush me."

<b>

In just a few seconds, the drug should start to take effect... I slowly savor the sweet taste of victory.

<b>

"Alright, you drank it! Now, Master, refill!"

"...Huh?"

<b>

The young girl calmly asks for a refill. Yes, she’s calm. Even though she should have taken the drug.

Was there a mistake? Let’s try again.

<b>

"Ahh! Hah, I might be a little tipsy? Just kidding!"

"Ugh, gulp... Ahh. Hey, don’t push yourself, okay? Why not admit defeat?"

"That’s what I should be saying. Your drinking speed is slowing down. Hurry up and drink?"

<b>

I gulp down the alcohol.

Damn it, what’s going on? Did the master betray me?

<b>

I glare at him, but he shakes his head vigorously, saying no way.

...Damn it, damn it! One more time!!

<b>

<b>

This is unbelievable...

From the middle, she started asking for refills without waiting for me to finish, and she’s already emptied a barrel!

Where on earth did this girl hide all that alcohol!? This can’t be real!?

<b>

<b>

...Wait a minute. It’s a drinking contest, right?

That means, for me to win against her, I have to drink enough to empty a barrel too, even if she collapses, right?

<b>

N-no! If she collapses, I can make any excuse... but I’ve put sleeping pills in mine! Sleep already! Why aren’t you sleeping!?

<b>

"Ahh, I’m starting to feel a bit hot. Master, refill!"

"...Wha, a monster...!!"

<b>

As I tried to complain, my stomach churned. This is bad...

<b>

"Huh? Huh? What’s wrong, giving up already?"

"...Oborororororogeba."

"Ugh, that’s disgusting. Don’t throw up the good alcohol."

<b>

I hurriedly cover my mouth with my hand, but it was already too late.

I misjudged my limits with this unfamiliar, easy-drinking alcohol... It was an undeniable loss.

<b>

In my hazy consciousness, I hear the young girl declare her victory.

<b>

"Yay, I win! Master, please bill him as promised!"

"...Okay."

"Hey you guys, if you learn from this, don’t mess with me. Anyone with complaints can challenge me to a drinking contest!! Hahaha!!"

"Guh, guuuh..."

"I-I’ll remember this!"

<b>

I was carried away by my subordinates to the inn.

During that time, I ended up exposing myself covered in vomit...

<b>

Damn! Damn! That girl... how dare she humiliate me... I’ll remember this...!
