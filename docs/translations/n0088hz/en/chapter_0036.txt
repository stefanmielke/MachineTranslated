# Drinking Comparison (Pirate's Perspective) 2

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I drink the liquor you buy. You drink what I buy. How's that?"

Yeah, that's fine, okay?"　Okay, Master. Judge Yoro."

<blank>

The little girl easily drinks my suggestion.

Fool, the master here is at my beck and call. He won't accept a single drink if I'm going to spill even a little bit to gain an advantage.

<blank>

And, quite naturally, I was able to get into the game with a weak drink and the little girl with a strong drink. Well, I had drunk first, so it was just as well, right?　It's your own fault if you don't notice.

<blank>

Kook, the game is decided before it begins!

<blank>

<blank>

Okay, first drink. Cheers."

Oh, yeah."

<blank>

He takes a sip of his drink. --Wow, it's pretty good, isn't it? It's probably a good drink for women and children, though it's too weak and not enough for me.

<blank>

"Phew, here's another one."

I'll have another one. Another one."

<blank>

The little girl also tipped her mug of sake and drank it.

It's a good drink, and he's just asking to compare drinks.

<blank>

But you will never beat me!

That's been decided from the very beginning, when we set up the game!

<blank>

<blank>

I thought to myself, "Hmmm, hmmm. Wine smells good after all."

"Heck, your liquor is shit, I can't get drunk at all."

...... hey you, can you say that in front of the dwarves?"

?　Why is there a drinking frenzy?"

That's the kind of booze that dwarven peddlers make you buy, right?"

<blank>

...... Dwarves stocking booze, huh? No wonder it tastes so good.

You don't think it has anything to do with that booze fiend, do you?　Is there no way that there is such a little girl?

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, I'm going to have a drink.

<blank>

Uppp. Even with my weak drink, I was getting hungry.

I mean, this little girl wine goes down like a gulp of water. ......

<blank>

Yes, another one!"

I got a refill at ......."

<blank>

It's about time to get the liquor flowing and lose the taste - now is the time to do it. I give the signal to my men. It's a sleeping pill-infused drink.

The secret to my drinking, always winning, always undefeated. That's exactly what this sleeping pill-infused drink is!

<blank>

"Cheers!"

"Oh, here's to you."

<blank>

The little girl holds up a bottle of sake and gulps it down in one gulp.

They didn't even know that there was a drug in that drink. ......

<blank>

<blank>

'Puh-lease! ...... hmm?　What. You should drink quickly, too. Come on."

"......, don't be in such a hurry."

<blank>

A few more seconds and the drugs should kick in...... I slowly drink my victory drink.

<blank>

"All right, you've had your drink!　Well then, Master, another!"

"...... hmm?"

<blank>

The little girl asks for a refill with impunity. Yes, she is unconcerned. I thought I had taken my medicine.

Did I make a mistake?　Again.

<blank>

Phew!　Ha, maybe I'm getting a little drunk?　What the heck!"

I'm not sure if I'm being too hard on myself or too hard on myself. Hey, you, don't push yourself too hard, okay?　Why don't you admit defeat?"

That's my line," he said. You're drinking slower. What's wrong with you?

<blank>

He gulps down his drink.

Damn it, what's going on?　The Master betrayed us?

<blank>

I glare at him, but he shakes his head, perish the thought.

...... Damn, damn!　Again!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

This guy can't be. ......

He asked for a refill before I had finished my drink, and he had already emptied the keg!

Where the hell did this woman get all that booze!　How is that possible?

<blank>

<blank>

Wait a minute, ....... Drinking contest, right?

That means. If I'm going to beat this guy, even if he goes down right now, I have to drink enough to open a keg, too, right?

<blank>

No, no!　You can make any excuse you want if this guy goes down ......, but we've even put sleeping pills in him!　Go to sleep!　Why aren't you sleeping?

<blank>

I'm getting a little hot. Master, another drink!

"......, you monster ......? ......!"

<blank>

I was about to make a complaint, but then the contents of my gut started to rise up in my ugh. Yaba: ......

<blank>

Oh?　Oh?　What's the matter, are you giving up already?"

...... dumb-rool-roge-baah."

"You're so dirty! Don't spit out my drink.

<blank>

I panicked and held my mouth with my hand, but it was too late.

It was an uncontested loss ...... that misjudged the limits with an undrinkable, easy-drinking drink.

<blank>

I listen to the little girl's declaration of victory in my fading consciousness.

<blank>

I win!　Master, please give him the bill as promised!

"...... hi"

If you get tired of this, don't get involved with me. If you have a problem with me, I'll make you compete with me in a drinking contest!　Ha ha ha!

"G-G-G-Nuh-uh."

Oh, oh, remember me!"

<blank>

I was carried to the inn by my crew.

In doing so, I was exposed to a vomit-covered ......

<blank>

Shit!　Shit!　You little bitch. ...... How dare you humiliate me. ...... Remember that. ......
