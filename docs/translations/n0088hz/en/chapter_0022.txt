# Attacked?　Double payback!

(I made a mistake and posted yesterday's post the day before yesterday. Sorry for disturbing your pace.

(I'm sorry to say that I've added illustrations to the post of the 28th instead.)

I'm Karina. It seems I'm being targeted!

I'm scared!　I'm so scared, I'm going to have to go the other way and get in there and beat the crap out of him!

<blank>

I thought about starting my work after delivering the socks to God, but since I want to soak in the memories of Sati-tan for a while longer, I will deliver the socks tomorrow.

In addition, I want to make a donation to the church, so for today, I'm going to hunt bad guys and make a donation. Wow, more and more puff, puff, puff.

So, before noon, I was a woodcutter to increase its value as bait.

With the help of Braid's seniors, we earned another 40 silver coins.

<blank>

What?　Didn't I say I was tired of lumberjacks?

That's okay, because this is preparation for the main dish!

<blank>

What?　You're a newcomer with 40 silver coins?　What a bastard!　This is the last time I'm going to see you!"

I'm going to be a merchant now!　We're going to be merchants now, receptionist, so let's withdraw all 25 silver coins, or rather, 40 silver coins, and we'll go to Shun Lai Pavilion and have a grand old time!　Let's go to Shun Lai Pavilion and have a grand old time!"

Damn it!　Remember me!"

Your baby's a bitch!"

<blank>

I will present the trifecta I discussed while woodcuttering at the Adventurer's Guild. This should let my targets know what I have and what I plan to do.

Pretending to have broken up a fight with Blade-senpai, the senpai went ahead to Harumikazuchi-sister's place. They plan to serve me water while saying sake.

<blank>

I strolled around town, proudly showing off my figure, shopped at the market, refused to buy liquor, and leisurely made my way to the Shung Lai Pavilion with a bottle of liquor that I had replaced with water.

<blank>

"Welcome. I heard you made another fortune, didn't you?"

Harumikazuchi-sama!　Please come here! This sake was bought by a senior merchant!

I don't blame you at all. If it's free, it's not a deal, so you can leave it with me."

'Hmmm, I'll give you about five then!　I love you, sister!"

<blank>

Oh, here is the alcohol for the cooperation fee. Please pay it.

It is a drink that is sold in this town, so it doesn't seem to be anything strange.

<blank>

I was surprised that they bought me such a good bottle of sake. I'll have to serve you today. Have a drink.

Yay."

<blank>

And I drink the water that Sister Harumikazuchi poured for me. Yes, the story is going well. Even plain water is nectar when it's poured for me by my sister. Hehehe.

<blank>

<blank>

So, we indulged in a glass of water and are now in the alleyway at night.

I am almost empty-handed except for a backpack with a bottle of sake.

<blank>

This is where I got tangled up the other day when I was walking around aimlessly. I was too tipsy to notice. Now, let's see if I can catch it.

<blank>

And then, after some steps into the alleyway, a man appeared.

<blank>

This place is closed to traffic.

Well, well, well."

<blank>

A wallet popped out!　I can't help but smile.

Kukuku, I'm sober today, I won't let you go, okay?

<blank>

What the hell?　What a grinch. ...... Hey, block up the back. If you look closely, you'll see the top ball, don't let it get away."

I'll take care of it, big brother.

<blank>

Footsteps behind me. Oh my god, I'm stuck between wallets!　Which money should I pick up from, I'm so confused!

Just ......2 people?　Hmmm, well, let's just stick with these guys for now.

<blank>

<blank>

What is it, guys? Robbery?　Do I feel like I'm being robbed?"

If you know what you're doing, just give it to me. And all the clothes you're wearing."

'Of course, we'll make the contents of your clothes into toys for us to play with and then sell them to the slavers.

"Hey, what is it, a slaver?　But what kind of slaver buys a good, ordinary person with no crime and no debt?

<blank>

So that means that guy is my safe!　I'm sure of it!

I'm so happy that my lines have become barbs. Dehehe.

<blank>

I don't have any money to give you!　Get out of my way!

<blank>

No, don't retreat, just attack me. Come on, come on, it's a dare. As I struck a fighting pose in my mind, the purse in front of me drew its sword.

It's clear intent to harm. I've heard that self-defense is possible at this point, but I'd like a little more so I don't become over-defensive.

<blank>

"Hey, little girl, you don't want to get your pretty face scratched, do you?　You don't want to get your pretty face scratched, do you?

You are an idiot. If you hurt your body, not just your face, you'll lose value. No blades, right?"

Hmm?" ...... if you ask me?"

<blank>

No, no, no, don't convince me. Go ahead and attack. We're invincible with space magic and waiting to attack.

<blank>

Who's the idiot, Goraru!

Time difference?

<blank>

Here it comes!　Gatun!　He is struck by the flat part of the sword. Even if the blade is not up, the sword is still a piece of metal, a normal blunt weapon.

Well, I'm not moving even a millimeter with no damage. This is a perfect case of self-defense!

<blank>

"Don't--"

"Ei."

<blank>

With a shun, purse A is put away in the storage space.

Inside, time stands still, so there is no need to worry about being roughed up.

<blank>

Hey, hey, hey!　Where'd you take my brother?

Now, where is it? It's gone, aren't you scared?　Vero Vero Bar."

Hiccup...... ohhhh!"

<blank>

Whoa, wallet B attacked me instead of running away. Good, let's get hit once. ...... Yeah, it doesn't hurt anything, but it's a little startling to get a fist smash in the face. It's like a face smack VR?　It's not V though.

<blank>

Hard!　What the hell are you!

Huh?"　I'm a good adventurer. It's terrible that you hit me unilaterally, you know.

<blank>

With a snap of the fingers, the lower half of wallet B is fully secured. We won't let you go, will we?

<blank>

"Oh, my legs can't move!　What?

"You're the ones who tried to kill me first. ...... huff ...... oops, don't give me that pathetic screech. People will come, won't they?"

<blank>

Blocking voices.

Wallet B, which is flapping its mouth like a goldfish on an acid trip.

<blank>

...... Even the self-proclaimed God of Chaos can't escape, so how can a mere wallet escape?

<blank>

Well, let's hear all about it then!　Let's start with the safe!
