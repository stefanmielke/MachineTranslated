# Attack? Double the return!

(I made a mistake with the scheduled post and ended up posting the one from yesterday the day before. Sorry for messing up the pace.

As a substitute, I added an illustration to the post for the 28th, so please forgive me.)

<b>

I'm Karina-chan. It seems like I'm being targeted!

I'm scared! Since I'm scared, I have no choice but to charge in and blow them away!

<b>

I thought about starting things after delivering the socks to the god, but I want to bask in my memories with Sati-tan a little longer, so I'll deliver them tomorrow.

By the way, I also want to make a donation to the church, so for today, I plan to hunt down some villains and earn some donation money. Yay, let's go wild!

<b>

<b>

So, I chopped wood in the morning to increase my value as bait.

With the help of the Blade seniors, I managed to earn another 40 silver coins.

<b>

Huh? Didn't I say I was tired of chopping wood?

This is just preparation for the main dish, so it's fine!

<b>

"What?! You, a newbie, managed to bring in 40 silver coins?! What a jerk! This is the last time I'll deal with you!"

"Heh, it's your fault for getting fooled! I'm going to become a merchant from now on, receptionist lady, give me 25 silver coins, no, let's withdraw all 40 coins! Let's celebrate with a lavish feast at the Shunrai Inn!"

"Damn it! Remember this!"

"Your mom's a belly button!"

<b>

While chopping wood, I showcased the three-penny play we rehearsed at the Adventurers' Guild. This should convey my funds and plans to the targets.

I pretended to have a falling out with the Blade seniors, and they went ahead to the place of Sister Harumikazuchi. They plan to serve me water instead of alcohol.

<b>

I strolled through the town, proudly showing off my appearance, shopped at the market, was refused when trying to sell alcohol, and leisurely headed to the Shunrai Inn while chugging a bottle of wine that I had swapped for water.

<b>

"Welcome. I've heard the news, you made some money again, huh?"

"Sister Harumikazuchi! Please listen! I was forced to buy this alcohol from a senior merchant!"

"Well, that's just how it is. If it's free, it won't count as a transaction, so you can leave it here."

"Hmm, then I'll gift you about five bottles! I love you, sister!"

<b>

Ah, this is the alcohol for the cooperation fee. Please accept it.

It seems to be alcohol sold in this town, so it shouldn't be anything strange.

<b>

"Oh, surprisingly, you bought some good alcohol. I guess I have to give you some service today. Well, drink up."

"Yay!"

<b>

I drank the water that Sister Harumikazuchi poured for me. Yup, the plan is going perfectly. Just plain water, but when poured by my sister, it tastes like nectar. Hehe.

<b>

<b>

So, I indulged in drinking the water, and now I'm in the back alleys at night.

Aside from the backpack with the wine bottle, I'm almost empty-handed.

<b>

This is where I was approached the other day while wandering around. I didn't notice because I was slightly tipsy. Now, will I catch something?

<b>

As I stepped further into the alley, a man appeared.

<b>

"This is a no-passage zone."

"Oh my, oh my."

<b>

A wallet popped out! I couldn't help but smile.

Hehehe, I'm sober today, so I won't let you escape!

<b>

"Huh? What's with that grin... Hey, block the back. Now that I look closely, she's a real catch, don't let her escape."

"Leave it to me, bro."

<b>

Footsteps behind me. Oh no, I'm caught between wallets! Which money should I pick up first? It's a dilemma!!!

...Just the two of them? Hmm, well, I guess these guys will do for now.

<b>

<b>

"What do you want, you guys? A robbery? Do I feel like I'm being attacked?"

"Heh, if you understand, hurry up and hand it over. Everything you're wearing too."

"Of course, we'll make your clothes our toys and sell you to a slave trader."

"W-What?! A slave trader?! But, isn't there any slave trader who would buy a good, law-abiding citizen with no crimes or debts?"

<b>

So that means he's my vault! No doubt about it!

I got so excited that my lines turned into a monotone. Hehe.

<b>

"I don't have any money to give you! Get lost!"

<b>

No, don't back down, attack me. Come on, hurry up, it's your job. As I mentally took a fighting stance, the wallet in front of me drew a sword.

Clear intent to harm. At this point, self-defense seems to be established, but I want a little more before I go overboard.

<b>

"Hey, miss, you don't want to get a scratch on that pretty face, do you? Just do as I say."

"Are you an idiot? If you scratch my face or body, my value will drop. Isn't a blade a bad idea?"

"Huh? ...Now that you mention it, that's true?"

<b>

No, no, don't agree with that. Come at me. I'm in an invincible state using spatial magic, waiting for an attack.

<b>

"Who are you calling an idiot, you bastard!!"

"Time lag!?"

<b>

Alright, here it comes! Bam! I get hit with the flat side of the sword. Even without the blade facing me, a sword is a chunk of metal, it's a blunt weapon.

Well, I don't take any damage and don't move an inch. This completely establishes self-defense!

<b>

"What the—"

"Take this!"

<b>

With a swoosh, I stored Wallet A in my storage space.

Time stops inside, so there's no worry about them causing a ruckus.

<b>

"W-Where did you take my bro!?"

"Now, where could he be? He seems to have disappeared, are you scared? Belly belly bar."

"Eeek... Waaaaahhh!!"

<b>

Oh, Wallet B didn't run away and charged at me. Good, I'll let him hit me once... Yeah, it doesn't hurt at all, but getting punched in the face is a bit surprising. Feels like face smash VR? Not that it's VR.

<b>

"Hard?! W-What are you?!"

"Huh? I'm just a good, law-abiding adventurer. It's terrible of you to hit me without warning."

<b>

With a snap, I fixed Wallet B's lower body completely. No escaping for you!

<b>

"Ah, my legs won't move?! W-What, what the—"

"You guys were the ones trying to kill me first... Hehehe... Oh, please don't let out any pathetic screams. People will come, you know?"

<b>

I cut off their voice.

Wallet B flails its mouth like a goldfish gasping for air.

<b>

...If even a self-proclaimed chaos god can't escape, there's no way a mere wallet can escape, right?

<b>

Now then, let's hear all sorts of things! First, about the vault!
