# Papapapapapaan, I have fallen. Nam.

<b>

On that day, just before the new moon, the dungeon was quite filled with monsters.

(However, here behind the dungeon boss, the proliferation of monsters is almost irrelevant.)

On the other hand, it seems that the dungeon core we are watching has slightly faded in color.

<b>

"Is it weakening...? I can't really tell. Hey, Dia?"

"It's definitely lighter compared to the first day."

<b>

Dia-kun (dressed as a boy today) is poking at the barrier with interest.

The barrier installed here is a magical tool, so it is unrelated to the state of the dungeon. But since it's a magical tool, Dia-kun seems to be curious about it.

<b>

...If you're that curious, should I make a copy for research? Yeah.

<b>

<b>

At that moment, there was a reaction from the spatial magic sensor set up near the dungeon boss.

<b>

"Someone's coming. Dia-kun, return to the base."

"Ah, yes. You two be careful."

"Oh? Finally a guest? Or is it the guild master?"

"I don't know. But it's not the guild master, just an unknown adventurer."

<b>

At the very least, it seems to be an adventurer who came through the proper route to greet the door guard.

It's almost impossible that they came to replenish supplies like food at the guild master's arrangement. If that were the case, they would have said something using the magical tool we provided for communication.

After sending Dia-kun back to the base, I transformed into a healer.

<b>

"Make sure to call me a healer properly in this mode, Lord Mashiro."

"I know, Kari, healer."

<b>

Mashiro-san, who corrected himself, scratched his head awkwardly. Please, really.

<b>

<b>

After waiting for a while, the revived dungeon boss was defeated, and a guest arrived.

It was a group of five men. They seemed to be an adventurer party.

<b>

"...Hey, Shirogane! What are you doing here?"

"Hm? Oh, isn't that 'Shining Sword'? What are you guys doing here?"

<b>

It seems they are an adventurer party acquainted with Mashiro-san.

Just as I was about to relax, Mashiro-san gently poked me. Ah, so it's suspicious, right? Yeah.

<b>

"We're here to conquer the dungeon. You see, with the new moon approaching, the monsters are increasing, right? We thought it was a good time to earn some. Come on, we told you. You should say something too."

"...It's guild business. No need to go into details."

<b>

Mashiro-san tapped his heels three times.

It was a prearranged signal. Understood, we're going to extract information.

<b>

"Don't be so cold. ...Hey, who is that suspicious-looking guy?"

"He's a helper for this job. By the way, Bibei, it doesn't concern you."

"Oh, so he's like a magical tool engineer. And Shirogane is the bodyguard."

<b>

Saying that, the leader of the group, Bibei, nodded in agreement.

<b>

"Whoa, don't get any closer. We're working here."

"I know that."

<b>

Saying that, the five men casually took out tubes from their pockets and pointed them at us.

Moments later, there were five explosion sounds.

...The shape was just a tube, but it was a disguised gun.

<b>

"Ugh, wh-what the hell did you do, you bastard...!"

"Haha, surprise attack successful! I guess the beast can't comprehend the benefits of civilization?"

<b>

Mashiro-san knelt down, pressing on the spot he was shot.

It was a bit of an overacted line from Mashiro-san, but Bibei approached with a smirk, not noticing.

<b>

"M-Mashiro-san!"

"Oh, we have to take care of this one too."

"Guah!"

<b>

Now, the five aimed their guns at me. Papapapapapaan, I have fallen. Nam.

<b>

Well, of course, both Mashiro-san and I are unscathed.

There's no way I'd let Mashiro-san get hurt, right?

The damage that got through was just a slight poke that was enough to indicate where he was shot.

<b>

But Bibei, unaware of that, was gloating in front of the kneeling Mashiro-san.

<b>

"Heh, what a sight, Shirogane. It's the punishment for getting cocky after being called an A-rank adventurer by some beast."

"What did you say, you bastard... ugh."

<b>

Mashiro-san, who only pretended to be in pain, was cute.

Thinking that, I continued to watch the situation.
