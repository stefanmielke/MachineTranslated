# Papa papa papa, I fell down. Nyamu.

<blank>

On that day, the day after the new moon, the dungeon was quite full of monsters.

(But here behind the dungeon bosses, the proliferation of monsters is almost irrelevant.)

On the other hand, the dungeon core we are looking over seems to be somewhat less black.

<blank>

'Are you weakening ......?'　I'm not sure. Hey, Dia?"

There's no doubt the colors are paler than they were on day one."

<blank>

Dia-kun (dressed as a man today) is poking at the wards with interest.

The wards installed here are magical tools, so they have nothing to do with the state of the dungeon. However, since it is a magical tool, Dia seems to be concerned about it.

<blank>

...... If it bothers you so much, I'll duplicate it for research?　Yeah, I'll do that.

<blank>

<blank>

And at this time, the spatial magic sensor I had put up at the dungeon boss responded.

<blank>

Someone's here. Deere, get back to the base."

Oh, yes. Take care of yourselves, both of you."

What?　Finally a guest?　Or are you a guildmaster?"

I don't know. But I'm not a guildmaster, I don't know, adventurer."

<blank>

At least he is an adventurer who came by the legitimate route to greet the doorkeeper.

It is almost impossible that the guildmaster could have arranged for them to come here to replenish food, etc. If that were the case, there would have been a word with the magical tool modoki that I gave him for contact.

I returned Mr. Deere to his base and transformed myself into a healer.

<blank>

When you are in this mode, please call me a healer, Mashiro-sama."

I know, Kari, healer.

<blank>

He scratches his head in a bad mood. Please, really.

<blank>

<blank>

After a short wait, the revived dungeon boss was defeated and the guests arrived.

They are a group of five men. It seems to be an adventurer's party.

<blank>

"...... Hey, White Silver!　What are you doing here?"

Hmm?　Oh, it's the "Shining Sword", isn't it? What are you doing here?

<blank>

It appears to be a party of adventurers who are acquaintances of Mr. Masilo.

I was about to let my guard down, but Mr. Masiello gently poked me. Ah, you mean suspicious, yes.

<blank>

We're going to attack the dungeon. You see, the new moon is coming and the number of monsters is increasing.　We thought it would be a good time to make some money. We've said our piece. You say it.

It's a job for the ...... guild. I don't have to tell you the details."

<blank>

Mr. Mashiro clicks his kakato three times.

It's a prearranged signal. Roger that. We're going to get the information out of him.

<blank>

Don't be a bore. ...... Hey, who's that weird-looking guy from?"

I'm just a helper on this job. I mean, Beebey, it's none of your business."

He was like, "Oh, like a grimoire technician. And Silver is his escort."

<blank>

The leader of the group, Bebay, nodded his head in agreement.

<blank>

"Whoa, don't come any closer. I'm working."

I know.

<blank>

With that, the five men suddenly pulled out a tube from their pockets and pointed it at us.

Immediately after, five popping sounds.

The ...... shape is just a tube, but it was a gun in disguise.

<blank>

"Ugh, what the hell did you do, you ......!"

"Hahaha, surprise attack successful, huh? Beast didn't understand civilization, did he?"

<blank>

Masilo-san kneels down, holding the spot where he was shot.

It was Masilo's line that smelled a bit like acting, but Bebay didn't notice and approached me with a grin on his face.

<blank>

Oh, Lord Masilo!

Oh, we'll have to take care of this one, too.

Gwah!"

<blank>

Now five people shooting at me. Papa papa papa, I fell down. Nyamu.

<blank>

Well, of course, Mr. Masilo and I are both unharmed.

How could I let Mr. Masiello hurt himself?

You can only see where you've been shot, and the damage is only a poke and prod.

<blank>

But Beebey, who doesn't know that, is winning in front of Mr. Masillo, who is on his knees.

<blank>

Kuku, you're in good shape, Shirogane. You are punished for getting carried away when you were raised as an A-rank adventurer.

You fuck, you ...... ugh."

<blank>

Mashiro-san is cute, only when he is in pain, he reads the words in a barbed voice.

With this in mind, I watched the situation unfold.
