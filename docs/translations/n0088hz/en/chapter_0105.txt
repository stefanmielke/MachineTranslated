# One Squeeze, One Silver Coin ●Illustration Included

<b>

In the dungeon town of Karukassa, the main tourist attraction is, of course, dungeon-related sites. But simply going to the dungeon would just be standard adventuring work.

So, I figured it would be better to check out any facilities connected to the dungeon, and I made my way to the church in Karukassa, thinking they’d know about these things.

<b>

I told Dear-kun and Aisia that I’d go pray and ask about nearby tourist spots. Well, not that I’m actually praying—because the gods and I are always connected… no, really. A simple shrine offering reaches them just fine. And I don’t have any socks to leave today.

<b>

As I walked through the open church doors, I spotted a familiar shade of pink.

My target this time: our dear comrade, Siesta, who’s everywhere, sharing the same memories!

Yeah, I don’t know anyone better informed about local sights than her!

<b>

"Hey, Siesta! Can you tell me about the tourist spots? …Wait, what?!"

"Ah, my esteemed peer, you’re carrying quite the lovely fragrance."

<b>

But the pink-haired sister at the church was a mature woman—one with striking sensuality.

She had a curvaceous, luscious figure, and her nun’s habit was on the verge of bursting.

<b>

She looks like she’d make sounds like “plump, plump” or “bounce, bounce” just by moving…

what an incredibly sinful appearance… gulp. This should be illegal! Parading around in public like this must be a crime! Seriously harmful to youth development!

<b>

"Um, you’re Siesta, right?"

"Yes. From the perspective of the Sorashidore version of me, I’m set as an aunt."

"An aunt! I see… that’s a new variation."

<b>

I mean, it’s hard to make everyone just cousins or twins, so they have variations like this. Amazing, just as I’d expect from a succubus. Universally adaptable to any taste.

<b>

"In a dungeon town like this, having someone with a mature and voluptuous figure is well received."

"Makes sense… Can I squeeze them?"

"One squeeze costs a silver coin."

<b>

So, she’ll let me if I pay? I mean, I won’t actually pay or squeeze, but maybe I would have if I hadn’t already had fun with Satie-tan and Aisia!

<b>

"Consider it a prayer fee. I’ve received high praise for the blessings it brings."

"So, they’re blessed boobs, huh?"

"Yes. And those who don’t feel blessed never return, so we’ve had zero complaints."

<b>

Wow, no wonder they’re so highly rated.

<b>

"…You’re joking, right?"

"Oh? Which part?"

<b>

Siesta just smiled. Ugh, such mature allure—she’s toying with me!

<b>

<b>

Calm down, deep breath…

<b>

"Anyway, is there a good sightseeing spot around here? Something dungeon-related, but not the dungeon itself."

"To be honest, this isn’t much of a tourist town. The only real attraction is the dungeon."

"Talk about blunt…"

<b>

I mean, I guess it’s like visiting a factory and asking if there’s a good soba noodle shop nearby.

<b>

"Oh, then how about the shops around the dungeon? Like the blacksmith. Since there’s a demand for weapons and armor, and they use dungeon-sourced materials, there might be something unique."

"A blacksmith, huh."

<b>

Nodding, I thought, not a bad idea.

<b>

"Thanks, Siesta! I’ll go check out the blacksmith!"

"Glad I could help. Now, how about a small donation for the consultation?"

"…Joking?"

"No, I’m serious. It’s customary to make a donation."

<b>

Ugh, a guided path for a lost lamb… with a fee!

Guess I have no choice…

<b>

"So, what’s the going rate?"

"Pancakes, if I remember correctly. I’ve heard this from the gods."

"…Pancakes, huh. Those can’t be copied with spatial magic… alright, I’ll give you one from my stash. I’ll throw in some honey, too."

"Oh, that’s wonderful. May the blessing of the gods be upon you, my peer."

<b>

Siesta drew a circle, the symbol of the holy mark, in the air as she prayed.

…Wait, was that circle supposed to be a pancake?
