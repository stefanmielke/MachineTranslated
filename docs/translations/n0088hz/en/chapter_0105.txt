# 1 rubbing silver coin ● Illustrations

Carcassa is a town of dungeons. The tourism there is dungeon-related, but just going to the dungeon is the work of an ordinary adventurer.

I thought it would be a good idea to find out about facilities that might be related to the dungeon, so I went to a church in Carcassa that seemed to know a lot about this kind of thing.

<blank>

I told Dia and Isiah that I would pray for them and ask them if there were any places we could go sightseeing. Well, I'm not going to pray. Because God and I are always connected. ......　No, seriously. I pray enough at the altar. I don't even have a sock to put it in right now.

<blank>

As I walked through the open doors of the church, I found a familiar pink color there.

The siesta, the purpose of this visit, is a companion who has been in every town and shares the same memories!

Yeah, I don't know anyone else who seems to know so much about the sights of each region!

<blank>

Hey Siesta!　Tell me about the sights! Woe is me ......!"

"Oh, you smell wonderful, don't you, my dear?"

<blank>

But the pink-haired sister in the church was a very mature woman.

She is so whip-smart and sexy. The sisters' clothes are also very flattering. ......

What the hell, I can almost hear loud onomatopoeia like "whip whip" and "thud thud thud" from his body. ......!

How disgusting. ...... gobbledygook. This is a crime, isn't it?　It's a very outrageous crime, like displaying obscene material while walking around or something!　It will seriously affect the upbringing of the youth!

<blank>

Um, siesta, right?"

Yes, I'm the one who is the aunt to Solacidore. From my point of view as a solasidore, I am the one who is set up as an aunt."

'Aunt!　I see, that's how it works. ......"

<blank>

It's impossible to have cousins or twins everywhere in quicksand. So there are variations like this. Amazing, indeed, a succubus. So sexually versatile, huh?

<blank>

In a dungeon town, this kind of rich fruitfulness is better received."

I see. Can I rub your tits?"

Each rubbing will be for one silver coin.

<blank>

If I pay you, you'll let me rub it? I don't rub and I don't pay. I would have paid if I hadn't just had a good time with Sati and Isiah!

<blank>

It is like a prayer fee. It's like a prayer fee, and people love it because it brings them good luck.

I see why they are such auspicious boobs."

Yes, and those who didn't get the blessing will not return. And those who didn't benefit from it don't come back, so we have zero complaints."

<blank>

Wow, that's sure to be a big hit!

<blank>

"...... kidding?"

Oh, um, which part?"

<blank>

A siesta with just a smile. Damn, I'm at the mercy of her mature sex appeal!

<blank>

<blank>

Stay-stay-stay, phew. Deep breaths for once. ......

<blank>

Well, aside from that, any good tourist attractions?　I'd like a dungeon-related place. Except for the dungeon itself."

It's not a tourist town to begin with," he said. The only thing to see is the dungeon.

"I can't believe I'm ......."

<blank>

Well, to put it another way, it was a bit misguided to come to a factory and ask if there is a good soba restaurant.

<blank>

Oh, then how about stores around the dungeon?　How about a blacksmith shop? There is a high demand for weapons and armor, and the materials may be somewhat unique in that they deal in dungeon-grown products.

Hm. Blacksmith."

<blank>

Ali, I nodded.

<blank>

Thanks Siesta, I'll go to the blacksmith!"

I am glad to hear that. Shall I charge you for the consultation?"

"...... kidding?"

No, seriously. Please go ahead and offer your feelings."

<blank>

Dang, did you have to pay for directions to the lost lamb? ......

I can't help it. ......

<blank>

By the way, what's the going rate?"

'Pancakes, yes. God told me about you, didn't he?"

"...... hotcakes, huh? I can't copy this one because it's void of space magic. ...... Okay. I'll give you one that I had left over. I'll put some honey on it.

Oh, that's great to hear. God bless your peers."

<blank>

Drawing a circle in the sky, the mark of the holy mark, Siesta prayed.

...... That wouldn't be a pancake symbol or something, would it?
