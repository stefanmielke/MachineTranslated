# There's no turning back.

Among the items I am holding, I have been told that I can freely handle the girl's clothes—specifically, the change of clothes for Dia-kun. It seems I won't have to go out to buy them, which is a relief.

Additionally, I will be able to receive the money that was in the possession of the pirates. In fact, since most of it was from "Kumin-san's sales," this will basically serve as Dia-kun's living expenses. Plus, for socks.

With the condolence money and sales, I actually think Maria-baasan is the one losing out the most, but she's quite generous.

Or perhaps for a lord, this amount is just pocket change?

<b>

"Hey, Karichan. It would be troublesome if you sneak into the building again, so make sure to come through the main gate like today next time, okay?"

"I got it, Maria-baasan. Kumin-san, please send me a letter when you arrive at a good place to unload the luggage."

"Yes, I will. Thank you. Dia, you take care and do your best. Perfect your cuteness."

"Yes, big sister... huh?"

<b>

And so, we waved goodbye and parted ways.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"So, what are you going to do now, Karina-onee-san?"

"For now, I’ll head to the church. I have various reports to make."

<b>

There are quite a few items that need to be delivered.

I should also stock up on some socks while I'm at it.

<b>

"Um, can I go back first then? I'm feeling sleepy..."

"Ah, you pulled an all-nighter, didn't you? I'm sleepy too... Well then, I'll go alone, so you head back first. You can use the pirate hideout room freely for now."

"Yes, excuse me. Please move."

<b>

With that, I stored Dia-kun in the storage space and headed to the church alone.

"God! I'm here to deliver――"

"You're hereeeeee!!! I've been waiting for you, Karina-chan!"

"Guhooo!?"

<b>

The god tackled me with such force that I was blown away.

I was pushed to the ground and pinned down in a mount position.

<b>

"Now, quickly bring them out! The socks! The boy's socks! For Dia-kun!!!"

"Y-yes. P-please accept them..."

<b>

I got up and presented three pairs of socks.

They were Dia-kun's boy's front and back socks, along with Kumin-san's socks set.

<b>

"Hehe... Nice. Wonderful. I can't stop drooling! Zubii!"

"Ah, using a red ticket that triples the appraisal value... Can I combine tickets?"

"You cannot! It would complicate the calculations!"

<b>

There's no turning back.

<b>

"Well, this time I'll make an exception and apply the triple red ticket to all three pairs. 

"Thanks a lot!"

"Um, for the appraisal, first the boy's socks... sniff sniff, hmm. The confusion and determination of being told to cross-dress is worth 20 SP. Kumin-chan's is also 20 SP, since it's practically new and hasn't been worn much... And! The main dish this time is the boy's socks! Ah, the bittersweetness of being teased by your first love is the best! 100 SP! I said I would guarantee 100 SP for the set, but there's no problem if it exceeds that, right? Rather, let me pay you. Cheers to these wonderful socks!"

"Of course, thank you very much."

<b>

Kumin-san's socks were surprisingly cheap. Apparently, they were almost new since he had just taken a bath and hadn't worn them much. Even so, that's 20 SP, tripled to 60 SP.

The total came to 420 SP.

<b>

By the way, did she just casually reveal Dia-kun's first love?

I'm sorry, Dia-kun, for being your first love.

<b>

<b>

"And there’s still more, right?"

"Ah, yes... um, it seems to be a divine artifact called 'Poseidon,' but where does it correspond on the ship?"

"I'll accept that separately for a flat rate of 1000 SP. And there’s still more, right? Come on, on the pirate ship? Inside?"

"…Ah, the bandages, right? Yes."

"That's correct! Yay!"

<b>

It seems the socks (bandages) are more important than the divine artifact. This god is consistent.

Well, from the god's perspective, they can just bring energy from elsewhere.

<b>

"Yes, yes. This also carries quite a bit of embarrassment. The despair of having your foot cut off, combined with the emotion when Karina-chan healed it, gives it a flavor akin to Goya Champuru! I'll give you 60 SP for three. I’ll issue a 1.5x ticket for the pirate subjugation, so I'll use it, okay?"

<b>

Oh, this turned out to be more income than I expected. 1.5 times that’s 90 SP.

<b>

The total is 1510 SP. This is a record-breaking victory in terms of income, isn't it?

<b>

"Ah, in that case, I have a 1.2x ticket for the drinking comparison left over... Right! How about I offer a one-year supply of menstrual skip medicine for 510 SP in exchange for this ticket? This is a limited-time price!"

"…!?"

<b>

This god is already trying to squeeze out the income from the socks!!!

Normally, it would be 600 SP for 510 SP, and indeed, 90 SP is a good deal... Even if I buy it with the ticket, I wouldn't be at a loss. Since it’s not a limited-time offer, there’s no expiration date.

<b>

"If you don't buy now, it’s off the table. Countdown starts now—ten, nine, eight..."

"W-wait, God, counting down is unfair!?"

"Seven, six, five..."

"I-I'll buy it! I'll buy it with the ticket and 510 SP!"

"Four, three, two, one!"

"I said I’m buying it, didn’t I!?"

<b>

The god clicked their tongue. Seriously. What does it mean to make me buy and then click your tongue?

<b>

"I can't help it, nya. I wanted to say zero, zero, zero."

"Why three times... If you're going to do that, please don't corner me, God."

"Ahaha. I'll put it in a small bottle for you."

<b>

Saying that, the god handed me a brown bottle containing twelve tablets of the skip medicine.

<b>

"Ah. Please have Dia-kun's socks once every six months!"

<b>

<b>

With the delivery completed and a year's worth of menstrual skip medicine obtained, I was sent off by the smiling god as I returned to the real world.
