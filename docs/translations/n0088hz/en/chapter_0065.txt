# It's not even a body.

Of the baggage we were entrusted with, we were told that we were free to change out of the girls' clothes - Dia's clothes - at any time. We are glad to hear that we don't have to go out to buy anything.

And as for the money that was in the pirate's possession, it was to be given to me. In fact, since the majority of the money was 'Kumin-san's sales', this will basically be Dia-kun's living expenses. And sock money.

I think old Maria is actually losing the most money on the sympathy money and sales, but she's being generous.

Or is this a small price to pay for a lord?

<blank>

I'm Kari," he said. We don't want you to sneak into the building, so next time, please come through the front gate properly like you did today.

I know what you mean, Old Maria. Kumin, please write to me when you get to the right place to take out your luggage."

Yes. I'm looking forward to working with you. Be cheerful and do well, Dia. Be the cutest."

"Yes, sister ...... eh?"

<blank>

And so we wave goodbye and say see you later.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, sister Karina, what are you going to do now? What are you going to do now?"

I guess I'm going to church for now. I have a lot to report."

<blank>

We have a lot of things piling up, deliveries.

I'll have to stock up on some socks while I'm at it.

<blank>

I'm not sure if I should go back first.　I'm, you know, sleepy. ......"

I've been up all night. I'm sleepy too. ...... Then, I'll go alone, so go back ahead of me. You can use the room in the pirate's hideout as you like."

Yes, after you. Please move on."

<blank>

And I put Mr. Dear away in the storage space and headed to the church alone.

<blank>

<blank>

"Dear God, I've come to deliver..."

I've been waiting for you, Kalina!　I've been waiting for you, Karina!"

Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

God hugging me with the force of a tackle. I was blown away.

He is pushed down to the ground and gets the mount position.

<blank>

Come on, let's get you out of here!　Socks!　The man's daughter's!　Dear boy!

Yes. Oh, please pay ......"

<blank>

He gets up and offers three pairs of socks.

The set includes Deere's socks and Kumin's socks.

<blank>

'Phew ...... that's good. It's wonderful. I can't stop drooling!　Zubi!"

Oh, using a Red Ticket for triple the valuation. Can I use the ...... ticket in conjunction?"

I can't do it!　It would be too much of a hassle to do the math!"

<blank>

It's not even a body.

<blank>

Well, this time I'm going to make a special offer and apply it to all three of these sets. Red triple tickets."

A bruise!"

"Well, here's my assessment. First of all, the boys' socks are ...... kun kun, hmm. The 20SP of confusion and determination that I was told to dress up as a woman. 20SP of Kumin-chan's, too. 20SP of Kumin-chan's are brand new, not worn at all. ......　After all, the main dish this time is man girl socks!　The sweet and sour feeling of being teased by your first love's older sister is the best!　I know I said 100SP guaranteed for the set, but there's nothing wrong with exceeding 100SP, right?　I'd rather pay for it. Here's to great socks!

Of course, thank you.

<blank>

Kumin's socks were unexpectedly cheap. He had taken a bath just before and they were almost new socks, hardly worn. Even so, they cost 20SP, or 60SP at triple the price.

The set cost 420 SP.

<blank>

I mean, casually, Deere, you've just revealed your first love.

I'm sorry I'm your first love and I'm kind of sorry, Dear.

<blank>

<blank>

And there's more, isn't there?"

Oh, yes. ...... Well, it seems to be the divine vessel 'Poseidon', but what is the equivalent of a ship?"

I'll take that as a yes, it's a flat rate of 1,000 SP. And there's more, isn't there?　Look, on the pirate ship, right?　Inside?

"...... Oh, you're the one with the bandages. Yes."

That's right!　Yay!"

<blank>

Socks (bandages) are more important than sacred objects? This god is not shaky at all.

Well, from God's point of view, all we have to do is bring energy from other sources.

<blank>

'Mm-hm. This shows a medium level of shame. The despair of having your leg cut off, combined with the excitement when Karina-chan heals you, tastes as if it were bitter melon stir-fry!　Let's give 60 SP for 3 people. I'll issue 1.5x tickets for defeating the pirates, you'll use them, won't you?"

<blank>

Oh, that's more income than I anticipated, 90 SP at 1.5x.

<blank>

Total 1510 SP. This must be a record-breaking big win for income.

<blank>

Oh, that would leave you with an extra 1.2x ticket for the drinking contest: ...... Yes, that's right. In exchange for this ticket, I'll offer you a year's supply set of period-skipping pills for 510 SP. That's the price for now only!"

"......!

<blank>

This god, he's squeezing the sock's worth of income out of me as fast as possible!

Normally, 600SP is 510SP, and indeed 90SP is a bargain, so there is no harm in buying it along with the ...... ticket. It's not a limited time offer, so there's no expiration date.

<blank>

If you don't buy now, no. Eee, joo, kyu, hachi ...... until time runs out."

"Nn-uh?　Wait, God, it's not fair to count down!"

Na-na-na, roku-roku, go-go."

I'll buy it!　I'll buy it with my ticket and 510SP!"

"Yo-yoon, sah-nee, one-two, one-two."

I said I'm buying!"

<blank>

God," he says, sticking out his tongue. What? What is the meaning of a tongue lashing after making me buy something?

<blank>

I wanted to say zero, zero, zero. I wanted to say zero, zero, zero."

Why three times...... so don't hunt me down, God."

I'll put it in a vial for you. I'll put it in a vial for you."

<blank>

Saying this, God handed me a brown vial containing 12 skipping pills.

<blank>

Oh. Dia-kun-chan's socks should be done about once every six months!"

<blank>

<blank>

The delivery was made, I got a year's supply of period-skipping pills, and the smiling God saw me off and I returned to this world.
