# I'm here to deliver!

<blank>

I, Karina!　I'm an apostle of God!

I came to collect treasures and deliver them in good health in order to get a prize from God!

Well, when I say treasure, I mean socks.

<blank>

The socks to be delivered this time are for seven people.

Masilo's first socks, and the living shame socks for five bebays and others.

That and the first delivery of Isiah's slave socks.

<blank>

<blank>

We went to the church for delivery and worshipped the fleshy Madame Siesta before going to the chapel.

Dear God - I'm here to deliver. ......

<blank>

'Carina, I've been waiting for you!　Get it out!　Let it all out!　Let it all out!"

Oh, oh. ...... please pay it forward."

Yay!"

<blank>

I take out my socks and line them up for God, who is still very insistent.

<blank>

I'm sure she's in good shape. As expected of Karina-chan.

I am honored by the compliment."

<blank>

Hehe," he bowed his head and accepted the compliment reverently.

<blank>

God says, "Which, which, which, which, which, which, which?" and chooses the first socks to examine.

<blank>

'Yeah, let's save the fun for later. Well then, let's start with ...... these slave socks!"

<blank>

With that, God reached for Isiah's socks.

<blank>

Is Isiah's the cheapest?"

Yes. I don't feel much shame. Well, 30 SP. Since it's the first time, I'll give you 40 SP as a bonus. I'm sure you and Sati will have fun with your sister socks."

<blank>

Oh, but a reasonable price. Nice!

You had 995 SP left, now you have 1035.

<blank>

Next time, I think they should at least throw him out on the streets naked except for his socks."



"You say that after you've been carrying a baby around?"

<blank>

And now it's the socks of Beebey and the other five. For one of them, I honestly don't know who it is, but God picks it up without hesitation and brings it to his mouth.

<blank>

'Ahhh, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, mmmm! ...... mmmm, mellow taste of shame!"

Wow, ......, how can you eat that?

I'm not a picky eater who can only eat socks made by beautiful women. Besides, to God, the sex of a ningen is not a big deal. Did Karina say that she can't eat pork unless it's from a female pig?

<blank>

Well, I understand that when you are of the same race, you are concerned about that too. God continues.

...... though I've never paid attention to the gender of pork sold in supermarkets, if you ask me.

<blank>

'Beautiful women are easier to shame and more palatable.'

It's really true what you said before, and that's all you were talking about. ......

<blank>

Well, I guess I'm a picky eater when my staple food is socks."

No, no, no, no. I eat food just like any other person. Socks are a luxury item. Just like a dog can't eat onions, but a person can eat onions, a person can't eat socks, but I can eat socks. That's all there is to it, isn't it?"

<blank>

Didn't I say that before?　And the God who stares at me.

Sorry, I honestly don't care.

<blank>

Well, let's do the assessment, it's for five people and we had a fun spectacle, hmmm...350 SP for five people!"

<blank>

Wow, that was more gutsy than I thought!

That's 70 SP per person...glad I collected enough for 5 people. ......

<blank>

The only thing I would say is that all five of us had the same taste, so it was just a big serving. If the flavors were more differentiated and the taste changed more, it could have scored higher. But I did get a chuckle out of the baby play while parading around town carrying a portable shrine."

I'm glad you enjoyed it."

It was nice that it wasn't explicitly shameful, like nudity."

<blank>

Huh?　Didn't you recommend that blatant nude shaming to Isiah earlier?

And when I nod my head, God adds.

<blank>

It's like cooking potatoes and radishes differently. Aisia-chan is a slave, so she has the humiliation that a slave deserves. ...... Oh, this one called living shame is also moderately good. If humiliation were a metaphor,...... concentrated lemon?"

It looks soooooo good."

This one has a nice flavor. Nice."

<blank>

God laughs and puts his socks away in his pocket.

<blank>

Now, this is a total of 1385 SP.

What is the valuation of the last one, Mr. Masilo's socks?
