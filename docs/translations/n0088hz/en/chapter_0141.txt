# I have come to deliver

<b>

I am Karina-chan! The apostle of the gods!

I have come to diligently collect treasures and deliver them to receive rewards from the gods!

Well, even if I say treasures, they are just socks.

<b>

This time, I am delivering socks for seven people.

Masiro-san's first socks, and the living shame socks of the five Bibeis.

And this is the first delivery of Aisia's slave socks.

<b>

<b>

I went to the church for the delivery, prayed to the well-endowed Madame Siesta, and then headed to the chapel.

God, I have come to deliver……

<b>

"Karina-chan, I've been waiting for you! Show me! Show me everything! Spill it all out!"

"Y-yes. Please accept them."

"Yay!!"

<b>

As always, the god is incredibly eager, and I start taking out the socks and laying them out.

<b>

"Hehehe, they look good. As expected of Karina-chan."

"I am honored to receive your praise."

<b>

Hehe, I bow my head and humbly accept the compliments.

<b>

The god is selecting the socks to examine first, saying, "Which one should I choose?"

<b>

"Well, let's save the fun for later. So first... these slave socks!"

<b>

Saying that, the god reaches for Aisia's socks.

<b>

"Are Aisia's the cheapest?"

"Yes. There's not much shame to be felt, you see. Hmm, 30 SP. Since it's the first time, I'll give you a bonus and make it 40 SP. It would also be nice to enjoy them with Sati-tan's sister socks."

<b>

Oh, but that's a decent price. Nice.

The remaining SP was 995, and now it's 1035.

<b>

"I think you should try throwing everyone out in the city completely naked, except for the socks."

"No, no, no, that's too much exposure play...!"

"Are you really saying that after carrying a baby palanquin?"

<b>

Now, it's the socks of the five Bibeis. Among them, I honestly can't tell whose sock it is, but the god picks it up without hesitation and brings it to their mouth.

<b>

"Ahh, nom nom. ...Mmm, the rich taste of shame!"

"Wow... you really can eat that."

"I'm not picky about only eating beautiful women's socks, you know. Besides, for the gods, human gender isn't a big deal. Did Karina-chan say she can only eat female pig meat when eating pork?"

<b>

Well, I understand that it might matter among the same species. The god continues.

...Now that you mention it, I've never cared about the gender of the pork sold at the supermarket.

<b>

'Beautiful women are easier to feel shame and thus tastier.'

What they said before was really true, and that was all there was to it...

<b>

"Well, I think it's a bit picky to have socks as a staple food."

"No, no, I eat regular meals too. Socks are a delicacy. Just like dogs can't eat onions but humans can, humans can't eat socks but I can. That's all there is to it, right?"

<b>

Didn't I mention this before? The god glares.

I'm sorry, but honestly, I don't care.

<b>

"Well, let's assess them. Since there were five people and it was a fun spectacle, hmm. For five people, 350 SP!"

<b>

Wow, that's more than I expected!?

That's 70 SP per person. I'm glad I collected socks for five people...!

<b>

"To be honest, since all five have the same seasoning, it just feels like a large serving. If there had been more differentiation in flavor, we could have aimed for a higher score. But the baby play while carrying the palanquin through the town made me laugh."

"I'm glad you enjoyed it."

"It was also nice that it wasn't blatant shame like being completely naked."

<b>

Huh? Didn't I just recommend that blatant naked shame for Aisia's socks?

As I tilt my head, the god adds an explanation.

<b>

"It's like how the cooking method changes between potatoes and radishes. Aisia-chan is a slave, so there are humiliations appropriate for a slave. ...Ah, this living shame is also quite nice. If I had to compare the feeling of humiliation to something... concentrated lemon?"

"That sounds really sour."

"This has its own good flavor. Nice."

<b>

The god chuckles and puts the socks into their pocket.

<b>

Now, that's a total of 1385 SP.

What will be the assessment amount for the last pair, Masiro-san's socks?
