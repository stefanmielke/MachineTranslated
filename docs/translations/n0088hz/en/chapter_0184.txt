# Ceremony for the return of the sacred artifact

<blank>

Divine return ceremony.

<blank>

When the Five Grand Elders could not wait and began to work on the design of the workshop as well as the pre-creation of the furniture, they finally decided to hold the returning ceremony.

<blank>

Let's get this over with and get to the workshop!"

「「「「 workshop! 」」」」

<blank>

Everyone is breathing perfectly, ugh.

By the way, does the call "workshop" mean something like "ee-ee-oh" in dwarven culture?

<blank>

No, I think you simply enjoy the workshop. Aruji-sama."

Is that still the Dwarvish way?"

I am a dwarf, a craftsman. It's like entrusting me with a new instrument made by an old man. ......And besides, grandmothers are the best of the best of craftsmen, and I think they had an ideal workshop. ......What I'm getting this time is a workshop beyond that ideal.

<blank>

So you're simply having too much fun. On a level like the ultimate carrot for a horse or a 100+ point sock for God.

Incidentally, as a preliminary step, the "Breaking Wall Hammer" exhibit was reopened the day after it was returned to the museum.

And since the return of the sacred objects was notified during the akahagane, there was a huge turnout every day, as if to say it was the last time they had seen them.

<blank>

Of course, there were some who suspected that the "Breaking Wall Hammer" was a fake, but, well, it is the real thing, and if you get hit on the head with a picot, your suspicions will be cleared.

The real "Breaking Wall Hammer" is somehow unharmed when struck on an unrelated side of the bellows. What's going on here? I can only say it's a miracle of God.

<blank>

As for this last unveiling, it is no exaggeration to say that the returning ceremony had already begun.

<blank>

The daily large crowd means that there is a lot of traffic.

Special-ride buses were running and food stalls lined up in front of the museum. It had already become a festival.

It is still fresh in my mind that Mee was laughing so cute and high, saying about the economic benefits generated until today, the day of the show.

<blank>

I can't just give it back and be done with it," he said. It would be a waste.

Partly it's just that we Dwarves like to celebrate.

<blank>

Well, it's like a Dwarf who never misses a chance to drink.

Even if they return it, they will treat it as an after party for a couple of days and make a lot of noise.

<blank>

And from next year on, we plan to make it a regular festival to mark the anniversary of the return."

Wow, you're so smart, Mee-chan. You're so smart.

<blank>

Well, this is what a politician is supposed to do. Queen Mee, indeed.

<blank>

<blank>

That's why the show is today.

An altar is also being built for today. In three days.

A pyramid-shaped platform has been added to the roof of the museum. However, the top is partially flattened, and there is a space for several people to stand and a pedestal that is one level higher than the others. It is a space for ceremonies.

To make it easier to climb up there, the front of the pyramid also has a dwarf-sized staircase.

<blank>

All of the Five Elders, with the exception of Mee, would wear gorgeous black robes and surround the pedestal in the ceremonial space, and Mee would come up there with the "Breaking Wall Hammer" on behalf of the Tessin dwarves.

......It's a secret between us that I thought it looked like the Nantouka Cross Mausoleum in a certain end-of-the-century manga.

<blank>

Then I would raise the "Breaking Wall Hammer" to the heavens, and I would collect the rest and the ceremony would be over.

Well, that's it. It'll be over without any upheaval. Yeah.

<blank>

<blank>

Huh, I'm getting nervous."

'You're nervous too, Mee-chan, that's adorable.'

Of course we do. It's the first time I've ever had to return a sacred artifact, you know?"

<blank>

That's not many people who have returned their sacred objects to God.

I petted Mee-chan good and hard. The other four of us are just getting out ahead of them and surrounding the pedestal.

<blank>

But I'm the one who actually collects the money."

But still, some things make me nervous!"

We all thought of a gorgeous production. It's going to be great.

<blank>

I hug Mee-chan, who is trembling with nervousness, to cheer her up.

Add a massage to gently relieve tension. Massage is too convenient, after all.

<blank>

'Hah, I'm starting to calm down. Thanks, Kari. It's time for me to go.

Yeah, have a good day!"

<blank>

I said that and sent Mee off.
