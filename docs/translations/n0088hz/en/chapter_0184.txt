# Divine Artifact Submission Ceremony

<b>

Divine Artifact Submission Ceremony.

<b>

As the Five Elders could no longer wait, they began not only designing the workshop but also pre-creating furniture, and finally, the submission ceremony was set to take place.

<b>

"Let's finish this quickly and get to the workshop!"

"“““Workshop!!””””

<b>

Everyone is in perfect sync, huh, hee hee.

By the way, does the cheer "workshop" have a meaning like "yay" in Dwarven culture?

<b>

"No, I think they are just really looking forward to the workshop, my lord."

"Is that really a Dwarven thing?"

"More like a craftsman thing. It's like entrusting me with a new instrument made by you, my lord. ...Besides, the grandmothers are the crème de la crème of craftsmen, and I believe they had an ideal workshop... and what we are getting this time is a workshop that surpasses that ideal."

<b>

So they are simply too excited to contain themselves. It's like giving a horse the ultimate carrot or a god a pair of socks that score over 100 points.

<b>

<b>

By the way, as a preliminary measure, the exhibition of the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" resumed the day after it was returned to the museum.

And since it was announced that the submission of the divine artifact would take place during the Akahagane, it had been bustling with visitors every day, as if it were a last chance to see it.

<b>

Of course, there were voices doubting whether the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" was a fake, but since it is genuine, any doubts would clear up once it gets a little tap on the head.

After all, the real "Wall-Breaking Hammer" remains unscathed even when struck from an unrelated side. What is that? How does that work? It can only be described as a miracle from the gods.

<b>

Regarding this final unveiling, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the submission ceremony had already begun.

<b>

The fact that it was bustling every day meant there were many people around.

A special shuttle bus was running, and stalls lined up in front of the museum. It had already turned into a festival.

I still remember how Mii-chan was cutely laughing about the economic effects that had occurred leading up to today, the main event.

<b>

"Well, it can't just be a simple handover and done. That would be a waste."

"Of course, it's also because we Dwarves love festivals."

<b>

Well, it’s a typical Dwarven ruckus not to miss an opportunity to drink.

Even after the submission, they would probably celebrate for another two or three days.

<b>

"We plan to make it a regular festival as a commemoration of the submission day from next year onward."

"Wow, as expected of Mii-chan. So clever!"

<b>

Hmm, so this is what a ruler is like. Queen Mii-chan, truly impressive.

<b>

<b>

So today is the main event.

An altar has been created for today. In three days.

A pyramid-shaped platform has been added to the rooftop of the museum. However, the top is partially flat, providing space for several people to stand and a pedestal that is one step higher. It can be considered a ritual space.

To make it easy to climb, there are Dwarf-sized stairs at the front of the pyramid.

<b>

The Five Elders, excluding Mii-chan, are wearing luxurious black robes and surrounding the pedestal of the ritual space, where Mii-chan will ascend with the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" as a representative of the Teshin Dwarves.

...I thought to myself that it was reminiscent of some post-apocalyptic manga's something or other cross mausoleum, but that’s a secret.

<b>

Once the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" is raised to the heavens, I will collect it, and the ritual will be over.

Well, that’s it. It should end without any particular turmoil. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

"Ahh, I'm getting nervous."

"Mii-chan gets nervous too, how cute."

"Of course I do! This is my first time submitting a divine artifact!"

<b>

It's true that there are probably fewer people who have returned divine artifacts to the gods.

I gently patted Mii-chan. The other four had already gone ahead to surround the pedestal.

<b>

"But in reality, I’m the only one collecting it."

"Even so, what makes me nervous is still nerve-wracking!"

"Don't worry, don't worry. We all thought of a gorgeous presentation, right? You can do it!"

<b>

I hugged the trembling Mii-chan to encourage her.

I also added a gentle massage to ease her tension. Massages are incredibly convenient for various reasons.

<b>

"Ahh, I'm starting to calm down. Thank you, Kari-chan. It's time, I'm going."

"Yeah, good luck!"

<b>

I said that and sent Mii-chan off.
