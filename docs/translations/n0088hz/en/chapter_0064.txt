# I think responsibility should be taken

<b>

Kumin-san changed her socks. Ahem, she cleared her throat and started over.

<b>

"Um, is there anything else you want? It wouldn't be right to thank you with just socks. I really want to give you my brother."

<b>

Hmm. She’s really pushing for Dia-kun. It's true that Dia-kun is cute and comforting, but could there be a family inheritance dispute going on? Is this a way to get rid of him?

<b>

"Um, even if you say you want to give him to me, I don't know what to do... What should I do, Maria-baasan?"

"How about making him your husband? Personally, I think you should take on various responsibilities."

"Ugh...!"

<b>

I see, so that's how it is.

Certainly, with such a beautiful boy, if he grows up properly, he would be a highly sought-after catch.

<b>

<b>

The responsibility for turning him into a boy's daughter is indeed there...!

<b>

<b>

In other words, I need to find a bride for Dia-kun.

A bride who would be okay with a boy's daughter, huh? Well, if I look, I’m sure I can find one. If not, worst case, I could become his bride? No way, no way. He’s a child.

<b>

"Karina-onee-san. Um, can I also say something?"

"Hm? What is it, Dia-kun?"

"Your important mission... um, please let me help. I want to go with you. Is that not okay? If it has to be in girl’s clothes, I’ll continue to cross-dress!"

<b>

An important mission...?

Ah, is it about the socks? I see, Dia-kun's socks were very well received by the gods.

If that's the case, it would be fine to regularly deliver Dia-kun's socks. Of course, I’ll space them out so the gods don’t get bored.

<b>

Moreover, with Dia-kun, I could have fun making magical tools together, and above all, he’s cute, so it’s soothing to watch!

<b>

"I understand. If you’re saying that much, I’ll add Dia-kun to my party members!"

"Thank you very much! I’ll do my best to help save the world!"

<b>

Huh? The world?

Ah, oh no. I just remembered that I was trying to sound cool and told Dia-kun, "The great magician Karina has a noble mission to save the world"... Well, that’s not a lie, so it’s fine.

<b>

"…Karichan, I’ve never heard of the world before, but could you tell me more?"

"Yes, I’m curious too, Karina-san."

<b>

Ah, yeah, I guess so.

<b>

"Actually, it seems that the world’s balance is currently in the negative. It seems there are too many divine artifacts. So unless we recover some, it’s said that it will perish in as little as ten years."

"Ten years…"

"Only ten years… That’s a big deal."

<b>

I wonder if ten years is short from an elf's perspective.

<b>

"So that’s why you recovered the divine artifact 'Poseidon'. I understand now."

"I see. We elves will also advise the king to cooperate as a nation."

"The Pavelkant Kingdom will too. Ah, is it okay to report this up?"

"Eh?… I was thinking of taking it easy."

"…It might be fine for you, Karichan, but we don’t want to perish!"

"If we’re told we’ll perish in just ten years, it’s only natural!"

<b>

That’s true.

I’ll keep quiet about the fact that the world won’t perish as long as the gods don’t abandon it.

For the great magician Karina, it’s not a bad story. If we recover the divine artifacts, we can also earn SP.

<b>

"Well then, if you have information about divine artifacts that can be recovered, please let me know. Um, how should I contact you? What do you think, Dia-kun?"

"Can’t you do something with your magic, Karina-onee-san?"

"Sure, let’s go with that."

<b>

This is a nice idea that perfectly responds to my previous request to "clearly separate the great magician and the merchant." As expected of Dia-kun. Cute and smart.

<b>

<b>

So, it was decided to create a direct post in my storage space. If they put a letter there, I’ll go meet them whenever. There’s also a drawer for replies to come back.

…It feels like a creepy youkai post. Yeah.

<b>

"Um, can I write a personal letter to Dee with this?"

"Of course, that’s okay!"

<b>

If Dia-kun can contact his family, he won’t feel lonely.

If he feels lonely, he can come visit anytime!
