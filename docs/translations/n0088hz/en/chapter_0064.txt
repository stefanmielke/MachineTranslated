# I think you should take responsibility for your actions.

<blank>

Mr. Kumin changed his socks. He coughed and started over.

<blank>

I mean, is there anything else you'd like?　I can't thank you with just a pair of socks. I would like to give you my brother.

<blank>

Mmmm. You seem to be pushing Dia-kun a lot. Sure, Dia-kun is cute and soothing, but could it be that there's some sort of family feud going on in the family home?　Good riddance?

<blank>

"Well, I don't know what to do when you say you're going to give it to me, but ...... what should I do with it, Grandma Maria?"

Maybe you could groom him?"　Personally, I think you have to take responsibility for a lot of things."

Ugh ......!"

<blank>

I see, that's how it is.

He was certainly such a beautiful boy, and if he had grown up properly as he was, he would have been an excellent candidate for many people.

<blank>

<blank>

It is indeed responsible for making it a man's daughter. ......

<blank>

<blank>

I guess that means I have to find you a wife, Dear.

A bride who is willing to be a man's daughter? Well, I'm sure there are some out there if you look for them. If not, would I be your wife in the worst case?　No, no, no. The other party is a child.

<blank>

"Karina, sister. May I ask you something, too?

"Hmm?　What is it, Deere?"

I'd like to help you with your sister's important mission ....... I want to go with you. No, right?　If you say I have to dress as a girl, I will continue to dress as a girl!

<blank>

An important mission ......?

Oh, you mean the socks. Well, it is true that Dear's socks were very well received by God.

If so, it would be possible to deliver Deere's socks on a regular basis. Of course, I would leave enough time between deliveries so that God would not get tired of them.

<blank>

Besides, Dia can have fun making magical tools with me, and above all, she's cute, so I'm sure I'll be healed by watching her!

<blank>

I understand. If you insist that much, I'll add you to my party, Dear!"

"!　Thank you very much!　I'll do my best to help save the world!

<blank>

Hmm?　The world?

Oh, shit. Oh, by the way, I was being cool with Mr. Dear and said something like "The Great Magician Carina is on a noble mission to save the world." ...... Well, that's not a lie either, so it's okay.

<blank>

I've never heard of the world or anything like it, ...... Kari, may I ask you to elaborate?"

Yes, I'm curious too, Karina.

<blank>

Uh, yeah, right.

<blank>

I heard that the world's balance of payments is actually negative at the moment. There are too many sacred objects in the world right now. So, if we don't recover some of them, they will be destroyed in 10 years at the earliest.

"Ten years. ......."

It's only been 10 years. ...... that's a big deal."

<blank>

I wonder if 10 years is too short in terms of the elven time interval.

<blank>

So that's how they retrieved the sacred artifact 'Poseidon'? I'm convinced."

I understand. Let us elves advise the king to cooperate with the whole country."

And the Kingdom of Pavelkant. Yeah, I can report it to the top, can't I?"

What?" I was going to do ...... leisurely."

......Kari, that may be fine, but we don't want to perish!"

No wonder they say we will perish in just ten years!"

<blank>

That too, I see.

I'll keep quiet about the fact that God will not destroy the world unless he forsakes it.

It's not a bad deal for Kalina, the great magician. If you collect the sacred artifacts, you can earn SP.

<blank>

'Well, let me know if you have any information on any sacred objects that I can collect. Let's see. I don't know how to contact you. What do you think I should do, Dear?

Can't you do something about it with your sister Karina's magic?"

I'll do it. Let's go with that."

<blank>

Nice idea to respond to the order I had given to Mr. Dia before, "I want to keep a firm separation between the great wizards and the merchants". That's what I expected from Dia-kun. Cute and smart.

<blank>

<blank>

So, I have decided to make a direct mailbox in my storage space. It's like, if you put a letter in there, I'll come see you at the appropriate time. It's also got a drawer where you'll get a reply back from us.

...... Looks like a gegegous monster post. Yup.

<blank>

Um, can I write a personal letter to Dee with this?"

Of course it's OK!"

<blank>

If you can get in touch with your family, Dear, you won't be so lonely.

And if you miss me, you can always go see me!
