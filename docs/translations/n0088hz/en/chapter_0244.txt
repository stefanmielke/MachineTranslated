# Comfortable Air Travel

<b>

<b>

The inside of the container is furnished like a reception room, with a table and sofa, and carpeted. There is also a bed for napping. A pet cat is curled up sleeping on the sofa, and there are transparent round windows in the corners of the floor.

<b>

The container was lifted by Arthur and floated gently into the air.

<b>

『...Huh!? It's really super light!』

“See, I told you so. No matter how fast we fly, you don’t have to worry about G-forces inside, so feel free to fly.”

『What’s G?』

“Like, when you move quickly, it feels like whoosh, right? That.”

『Oh, that!』

<b>

...The concept of G can be understood as whoosh.

By the way, this conversation in Dragon language has been happening with my face sticking out from the ceiling of the container.

<b>

<b>

I pulled my face back in and returned to the inside of the container.

<b>

“Alright, let’s go for a comfortable air travel. We’ll check the outside scenery from the floor windows.”

“...We’re flying...! For real!”

<b>

The demon girl, Youki-chan, peered through the window installed on the floor, seemingly moved by the receding ground. Aisia was also watching intently, saying, “I just had an idea! This might inspire a new song to praise my master!”

<b>

“Don’t you want to look, Dia-kun?”

“I’ve flown on Arthur before.”

<b>

Dia-kun said, a bit smug. So cute.

By the way, I can fly normally using spatial magic, so there’s no need for me to look.

<b>

“What about Misha? Don’t you want to look?”

“Why am I even here??”

“Well, I thought it would be nice to have some comfort in this small space.”

<b>

I had casually called Misha when I deployed the container.

If the attendant is okay with it, then it’s fine for the pet to be included too. Comfort is important, you know.

<b>

“Which would you prefer, being poked by the Five Elders at the base for research or this?”

“...Just make sure to take me home at night, okay?”

“By the way, we’re heading to the demon tribe’s hidden village now. Want to come along?”

“Oh, that sounds interesting. I’ll join you!”

<b>

I like that lively attitude, my friend.

<b>

“Um, um. I’m not really okay with having more companions added without permission…”

“Eh? The attendant is fine with it, right? Don’t worry, I’ll bring my own food!”

“Don’t say food, Karina! But I’m actually pretty strong, so I can be useful, you know?”

<b>

Misha, who just met Youki, is putting her arm around her.

Misha has surprisingly high communication skills. Youki looks troubled and annoyed, though.

<b>

“By the way, we’re dealing with a dragon that demands sacrifices.”

“Oh, Karina, I’m definitely going home, so open the door.”

“You said you’d come with us! Dia-kun is all fired up!”

“Don’t drag Dia-chan into this... Tch, fine, I’ll go... Wait a minute!? What’s this, the ground is way down there!? Amazing!!”

<b>

Misha exclaimed happily as she peered through the window. I’m glad she’s enjoying it.

<b>

“Seriously, it’s super fast! Way faster than a carriage!”

“Well, Arthur is carrying this, after all. The speed of a Thunder Dragon is no joke. Oh, Youki-chan, let me know when we’re close to the village.”

“Yes, okay.”

<b>

And Arthur was faster than I expected, arriving at the village that night.
