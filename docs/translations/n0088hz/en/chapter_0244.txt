# Comfortable air travel

<blank>

<blank>

The interior of the container was like a reception room, with a table and sofa, and carpeted flooring. There was also a bed for napping. A pet cat was sleeping curled up on the sofa, and there were four transparent round windows on the floor at the corners.

<blank>

The container was lifted by Arthur and floated softly into the air.

<blank>

I've been thinking about it for a while now, and I've been thinking about it a lot.　It's really super light!

No, that's why I said so. Oh, no matter how fast you fly, there won't be any G's inside, so feel free to fly."

What's an "old man?"

You know, when you move too vigorously, it makes you squirm?　That's it."

That's it!"

<blank>

The concept of ......G, can you get through with a guffaw?

The conversation was conducted in dragon language with the face of a container on the ceiling.

<blank>

<blank>

He pulls his face from the ceiling and returns to the container.

<blank>

Let's go for a comfortable flight. Let's check what's going on outside through the window on the floor.

"...... and the flying ......!　Really!"

<blank>

The demon girl, Yohki, looks through a window set in the floor and seems impressed by the ground moving away from her. Aisia also said, "I have an idea!　This could be used in a new song to praise the Lord!" She is looking at it as if she is devouring it.

<blank>

Dear, don't you need to see this?"

I used to fly on Arthur.

<blank>

Dia-kun is a little bit proud of himself. He is cute.

By the way, I can normally fly by spatial magic, so there is no need to look.

<blank>

What about Misha?　Don't you need to see it?"

I mean, why am I here?"

'Well, I thought it might be nice to have some comfort in a small space.'

<blank>

I called Misha when I casually deployed the container.

If a follower is OK, then a pet is an OK follower. Healing is important, healing is important.

<blank>

"Would you rather have your ass pinched and studied by the Five Elders at the base?"

............ and return your house at night?"

By the way, we are going to the hidden village of the demon tribe. Would you like to go with me?"

I'll go out with you! I'll go out with you!"

<blank>

I like that kind of flippant attitude, my best friend.

<blank>

Oh, you know. I'm not going to let you add more people to your group without permission. ......"

What?"　You're OK with squires, aren't you?　Don't worry, we'll provide our own food!"

I'm not going to tell you what to do!　But I'm pretty strong, so I can help you.

<blank>

Misha is entangled shoulder to shoulder with Yohki, whom he has just met.

Misha is a good communicator for what it's worth. The other guy, Yohki, looks annoyed and troubled, though.

<blank>

Incidentally, we're dealing with a dragon that demands a sacrifice.

"Oh, Karina, I'm going home, so open the door."

You said you'd come with me!　Deere, you're willing to do it!"

Don't drag Dia-chan into this ......, I can't help it. ...... is a little bit long!　What's this, the ground is far below us!　That's amazing!

<blank>

Misha looked in the window and said happily. I'm glad you enjoyed it.

<blank>

"That's really fast!　Much faster than a horse-drawn carriage!

Well, it's Arthur who's carrying it. Thunder Dragon's speed is no joke. Oh, Yohki. Let me know when you get close to the village.

Yes.

<blank>

And Arthur arrived at the village earlier than expected, at midnight that day.
