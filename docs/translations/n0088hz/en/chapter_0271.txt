# Nothing feels as good as justice!

<b>

"Hey, Kali! I hear you're looking for thieves!? You've got a good eye!"

"Thieves are the best experimental subjects, right? You can do whatever you want with them for free!"

"In our country, there aren't any thieves left anymore."

"We've hunted them all down... teehee."

"There aren't even any new candidates wanting to become thieves. If you find some, share two or three with me."

<b>

Thus spoke the five elders.

...This dwarf country is something else.

<b>

Thieving = unlimited candidates for experiments, huh? No wonder thieves wouldn't do that.

Even if they were desperate, it would be better to apply as a test subject normally, where they could earn money and maintain their dignity...

<b>

It's a highway check, but since it was a road extending from the dwarf country, there probably weren't any thieves around.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, how did everyone find out? Did Misha spill the beans?"

"I told Dia-chan it was a secret, but should I tell your wife?"

"I was thinking of keeping it a secret from everyone. And you said Dia-kun and the others, right?"

"If that's the case, you shouldn't have told me in the first place."

<b>

Misha shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, as if to say "what a hassle."

For now, I gave her a couple of light slaps on the rear.

<b>

"...You haven't told anyone else, right?"

"Of course... I told Mashiro too!"

"Why!?"

"Huh? If I didn't tell her about this fun event called thief hunting, she'd hold a grudge against me, right?"

"That's right, Karina! You think you can leave me out and have fun? Not happening!"

<b>

Then, from behind, I felt a fluffy arm wrap around my shoulder. It's Mashiro, so soft.

It smells like a washed dog.

<b>

"Recently, the number of people wanting to become thieves has drastically decreased."

"Oh, Mashiro, did you leave the country because of that?"

"Yeah! After all, adventurers are supposed to hunt thieves, right? They hoard money and are pretty strong. Perfect for some fun!"

<b>

I see. In the beastman country of Terrarialby, it seems that spirited adventurers actively hunt thieves.

<b>

"By the way, even if you search the main highways, there are no thieves. Look for side roads instead. Those who are making decent money target one-shot merchants; the mountain paths with little traffic are recommended."

<b>

Saying this, Mashiro cheerfully gave me instructions.

Main highways are often patrolled by knights, and thieves tend to avoid them.

<b>

"O-oh. You're quite experienced."

"I became an A-rank without realizing it while hunting thieves!"

"Karina, this one was also known as the Thief Hunter Mashiro."

"Oh, that's a nostalgic name. Now I go by Silver."

<b>

Hmm, if that's the case... it would be better to skip the Terrarialby and Tesshin highways and look for somewhere else.

<b>

"Right. The Alchemy Kingdom was destroyed recently, right? The security around there must be terrible. It's a prime target."

"Oh! That sounds great! We can run wild there!"

"Oh? What's up, Misha? Are you thinking of becoming a thief?"

"I'll pass on that. I prefer being on the side that hunts thieves, wielding violence in the name of justice. I abide by the rules!"

"I agree. Nothing feels as good as justice!"

<b>

These two are saying some pretty questionable things. I've heard that people can become as cruel as they want if they have the justification of justice... but what even is justice? Ugh.
