# Nothing feels better than justice!

Kari," he said!　I heard you're looking for bandits!　You're so smart!"

I'm a bandit and a psycho experimental material!　And they can go to any length for free!"

In my country, we don't have bandits anymore.

"We've hunted it all down. ...... teehee."

There was no one new who wanted to be a bandit. If you find one, please share with a couple of people.

<blank>

The Five Elders all said so.

...... Yikes, Dwarf Country.

<blank>

Banditry = candidacy for unlimited experimenter, or, well, I wouldn't do it, bandit.

Even if you've eaten your way out, you'll get more money and dignity if you run for office in a regular clinical trial. ......

<blank>

It was a street check, but it was a road that extended from the Dwarves' country, so there were probably no bandits.

<blank>

'I mean, how did everyone know?　Misha, did you pee your pants?"

I told Dia-chan not to tell you, but is it something you should tell your wife?"

I was thinking, "Don't tell anyone, but I thought I'd do it in secret. I mean, you said you guys are Deere."

Then you shouldn't have told me in the first place.

<blank>

Misha shrugs his shoulders, not feeling sorry for himself.

I'll give him a couple of whacks in the butt for now.

<blank>

You didn't tell anyone else about ......, did you?"

Ichichi...... of course, I told Masilo!"

Why?

What?　What? You're going to hate me if I don't tell you about this fun event called "bandit hunting"?"

That's right, Karina!　You can't have all the fun by making me an outcast!

<blank>

And then, I was hunched over from behind. It's Mashiro-san, soft and fluffy.

It smells like a washed up dog.

<blank>

These days, there are fewer and fewer people willing to be thieves.

Oh, did Masilo leave the country because of that?"

"Oh, yeah!　Adventurers are supposed to hunt bandits, right?　They have a lot of money and they are strong. It was a good time to play!"

<blank>

I see. It seems that in Terra Realby, the land of the beastmen, bloodthirsty adventurers are actively hunting bandits.

<blank>

You won't find any bandits on the main roads. Look for more side streets. The ones who are making a little money are the ones who are after merchants who are looking for a shot, and I recommend the mountain roads where there are hardly any pedestrians.

<blank>

Masilo-san, in a good mood, instructs me to do so.

The main roads are often patrolled by knights, and bandits are said to avoid them.

<blank>

"Oh, oh. You're good at this."

I'm the kind of guy who hunts bandits and before you know it, he's an A rank!"

"Karina. This guy was also called Masilo, the bandit hunter.

"Oh, I miss that name. Because now I'm called Shirogane."

<blank>

Hmmm, in that case, I'd better go through ...... Terraria Ruby and the Tessin road and look for a more alternative location.

<blank>

'Yes. The alchemy kingdom was recently destroyed, right?　If so, the area must be in a bad state of security. That's a good target.

Oh, that's nice!　That's great. You can do whatever you want!

Oh?　What's that, Misha? You want to be a bandit?"

I don't want to do that. I prefer to be on the side of the bandit hunter, because I want to wield violence in the name of justice. I'll follow the rules!

I agree. There is no better feeling than justice!

<blank>

What you are saying is pretty much what these two are saying. I have heard that people can be cruel to any extent if they have the name of justice, but I wonder what ...... justice is. Ugh....
