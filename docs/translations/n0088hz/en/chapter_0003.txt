# With the power of the gods, the final boss was nothing but a weakling. (●Illustration included)

<b>

<b>

Thus, the final boss was easily taken down under the pretext of a tutorial.

<b>

Well, in reality, I had been torturing him slowly for seven days and nights like a thorough interrogation.

The god said, "Huh? You still don’t understand? Well, since it’s a tutorial, it’s only natural that you can say, ‘I didn’t understand, so please explain it again!’" and the poor old man was forced to go through another round of ‘restoring his body and mind’ without even asking for it.

<b>

<b>

Oh, I did deliver the final blow, though. "Now, let’s try using your abilities yourself! It’s just about severing the connection between your brain and body, easy, right?" I said.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, my apostle. You have splendidly defeated the audacious one who calls himself the god of chaos. Thank you for your hard work."

<b>

The god, now a voice in my heart, spoke to me.

It was nothing to be thanked for; it was a simple job of delivering the final blow to the final boss, who had been set up by the god, who was freely using all his power under the guise of a tutorial, and could only say, "…kill…kill me…" with 1 HP left. Actual work time: one minute.

<b>

…So, this was just the god wanting to cheat and beat him up, right?

<b>

"God… did I really need to be here?"

"Yes. It was necessary for procedural reasons."

<b>

I see. If it was necessary for procedural reasons, then it can’t be helped.

…Wait, thinking about it, what is this ‘procedure’ that even the god cannot defy? Is there someone above him? Scary.

<b>

<b>

"Well, I’m satisfied now that I’ve cleared my mind. So, as a reward, feel free to do as you like."

"Oh, okay."

"If you want to talk to me, just pray at a church or something. See ya!"

<b>

See ya? Is that a waving emoji? Does this world have Japanese?

…………

……

<b>

Huh, is it over?

Really?

<b>

Am I just left here?

<b>

……

Looking around, it was completely a ruin.

It seems there used to be an alchemical kingdom ruled by the self-proclaimed god of chaos, but it had turned into ruins due to the god’s full power backlash.

<b>

That area is probably where the space was connected up and down, causing infinite falls and infinite acceleration, repeatedly shooting debris from the rubble. Over there, was it a dimensional slash that cut everything in a straight line?

There are places that turned into scorched earth in an instant due to spatial environment construction, and others that became a mess after being flipped upside down and dropped from above.

And the biggest factor in this disaster must be the forced infinite storage and instant full release. That’s what made everything a jumbled mess.

<b>

<b>

…Yeah, each of those had the power to destroy a country at a super ultimate level.

Spatial magic is incredibly dangerous. Only a god could use it to this extent, but…

<b>

<b>

"Anyway, this will be referred to in later history as the country that incurred the wrath of the god and perished overnight."

<b>

A country that perished because it deceived the name of the god’s lover (god of love?)…

Even if I end up calling myself a god in the future, I’ve resolved to never call myself the god of chaos.

<b>

<b>

"Now, what should I do from here…"

<b>

I’ve lost all purpose. The self-proclaimed god of chaos, which was my original goal, is already dead. The god said to do as I please.

<b>

"Should I look for survivors of this disaster…? No, that would be troublesome if they resent me. After spending seven days on this, they’ve definitely seen my face. I should run away."

<b>

It was the god who did this. It’s not my fault!

So, I teleport towards the sky. After that, I teleport to the mountain I could see from the sky.

This should probably be a relief, right?

<b>

Phew, I let out a sigh.

Grrr, my stomach growled.

<b>

Speaking of which, I fought for seven days and nights, but I haven’t eaten anything in this world yet.

I thought maybe I had become a body that could go without food, but that was only because it was a tutorial, and normally, I would get hungry.

<b>

I noticed a fruit that looked like an apple and used spatial magic to pluck it and hold it in my hand.

…According to the basic knowledge given by the god, it seems to be a fruit that can be eaten normally. Munch munch.

<b>

This basic knowledge seems to only be usable when I consciously think about it.

It feels like there’s a dictionary called ‘basic knowledge’ placed in my head. Well, it seems they’ve also made it so that I can communicate with words as a bonus.

<b>

"Hmm, if that’s the case, I won’t have any trouble living normally since I have spatial magic."

<b>

If I just replicate this apple-like fruit, I wouldn’t have to worry about food.

However, living in the wild feels a bit resistant for someone who has memories of living in modern Japan. I’d like to live a more cultured life.

<b>

For example, a toilet.

…What’s the typical toilet in this world? Hmm, a slime-style pit toilet.

There are reports of being attacked by overgrown slimes from time to time. Scary.

<b>

Is there a mechanism that combines a flush toilet to prevent slime backflow…?

According to the basic knowledge, it seems there isn’t. It probably doesn’t exist unless I make it myself.

<b>

"…Maybe I’ll try being a craftsman… or even a merchant."

<b>

Speaking of which, the god also mentioned being a merchant.

Saying that made it feel like I was being guided somehow, but even so, there’s no particular problem with that.

<b>

I scratched my head and decided on my future course of action.
