# With the power of God, the last boss was a small fish. (● Illustrations)

<blank>

<blank>

That is how the last boss was easily finished off in the name of a tutorial.

<blank>

In reality, however, it took seven days and seven nights of slow and torturous torture.

God says, "What?　You still don't get it?　It can't be helped...it's a tutorial, so of course you can say 'I didn't understand, so explain again'!" I even felt pity for the old man who was made to "fix his body and mind and go around again" even though he did not ask for it.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, and in case you were wondering, I did the tome. 'Now, for the last time, let's use your ability on yourself!　All you have to do is sever the connection between your brain and your body, easy, right?" So that's what I did.

<blank>

<blank>

'Oh my apostle! You have successfully defeated the infidel who calls himself the God of Chaos. Thank you for your efforts.

<blank>

God, who has replaced me and become the voice of my heart, speaks to me that way.

It was a simple job of toppling the last boss who could only say "...... shite ...... koroshite..." at HP1, arranged by God, who called it a tutorial and wielded all his power as much as he liked. It was a simple job of putting the tome into the last boss who could only say " shite  koroshite..." at HP1. One minute of actual work.

<blank>

...... This is actually just God's way of cheating and wanting to go full bore, right?

<blank>

God ...... did you need me?"

Yes, it was procedurally necessary. It was necessary for procedural reasons.'

<blank>

I see. If it was necessary for procedural reasons, then so be it.

...... Wait, if you think about it, what is this 'procedure' that even God can't defy? Is there more than that?　Scary.

<blank>

<blank>

'Well, I'm satisfied that I've cleared things up. Then, as a reward, you are free to do the rest.

Oh, yes."

'If you want to talk to me, please pray at church or something. Bye, Noshi.

<blank>

Noshi. Waving hands? Is there Japanese in this world?

............

......

<blank>

What, the end?

Really?

<blank>

Am I neglected?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

......

I looked around and saw that the place was completely abandoned.

It seems that there was originally an alchemical kingdom ruled by a self-proclaimed chaos god, but in the aftermath of the god's full power, it has been completely ruined.

<blank>

That area is probably the remains of a series of debris scattering shots from infinite fall, infinite acceleration, and duplication of debris by connecting space at the top and bottom. That area over there is a dimensional slash that cut through everything in a straight line?

Some places were scorched in an instant by spatial environment construction, while others were ruined by dropping them on their heads by replacing the top and bottom of a certain space with the top and bottom of a certain space, called Tenchi Gyoretsu.

And the most decisive factor of this disaster must be the forced infinite storage and instantaneous total release. It made everything a mess.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Yeah, they all had the power to destroy a super-successful country, didn't they?

Spatial magic is super badass. I guess only God can use it so far. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, this is a nation that later in history will be spoken of as having been destroyed overnight by the wrath of God."

<blank>

God's lover (love god?) A country that was destroyed because it cheated the name of the "God's lover", or ......

I made up my mind that if I were to call myself a god in the future, I would never call myself only the god of chaos.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, what do we do from here ......?"

<blank>

It has lost any purpose. The original purpose, the self-proclaimed God of Chaos, is already dead. God says do as you please.

<blank>

"Should we be looking for survivors of this disaster or something? ...... No, I don't want them to hate me. We've been at it for seven days and hours, so they've definitely seen our faces. We should run."

<blank>

It was God who did it. It ain't my fault!

Therefore, I metastasize to the sky. Then I transition to the mountain that I saw from the sky.

This is probably a relief, right?

<blank>

Phew, I take a breath.

Gulp, my stomach rumbled.

<blank>

Come to think of it, I've been fighting for seven days and seven nights and I haven't eaten anything in this world yet.

I thought that maybe my body was fine without eating, but that was because it was a tutorial, and normally I would be hungry as well.

<blank>

Suddenly, an apple-like fruit that caught his eye is ripped off with spatial magic and held in his hand.

According to the basic knowledge given to me by ...... God, it seems to be a normal edible fruit. Mooch.

<blank>

This basic knowledge seems to be useless without awareness.

It's like they have a dictionary of 'basic knowledge' in their head. Well, it's like they are trying to get through the language and stuff as a bonus.

<blank>

'Hmmm, then I guess I'll have no trouble living a normal life with my space magic.

<blank>

If you want, you can duplicate this apple-like fruit and that's all you need to eat.

However, living in the wild is something that those of us who remember living in modern Japan are a bit reluctant to do. I would like to live a more civilized life.

<blank>

For example, a restroom.

...... Common toilets in this world?　Hmmm, slime botton toilets.

I hear that sometimes there are cases where people are attacked by overgrown slime. How scary.

<blank>

I wonder if there isn't some kind of mechanism that combines with a flush toilet to prevent slime backflow. ......

According to Basic Knowledge, it doesn't seem to exist. If you don't make it yourself, it probably doesn't exist.

<blank>

"...... artisans...... No, maybe I'll try being a merchant."

<blank>

Come to think of it, God said something about merchants, too, he said.

When I say so, it sounds like I was somehow led on, but even so, there's nothing wrong with that.

<blank>

I scratched my polly head and decided on a future course of action.
