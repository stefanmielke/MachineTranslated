# To be honest, that idea is scary

<b>

I suddenly thought of a way to kill time.

<b>

"By the way, there are thieves, right?"

"Yeah, there are."

"Aren't they the kind you can kill?"

"That's right."

"So if I catch one, wouldn't that mean I can use them as an experimental subject for anything?"

"…What you're saying isn't wrong, and no one would be troubled by it, so I guess it's fine, but to be honest, that idea is scary."

<b>

Alright, if Misha says so, it must be true.

So, I decided to search for thieves to obtain a "human that can do anything" beyond just a slave.

<b>

"I'm going to do things even Aisia can't do, hehehe."

"This guy is dangerous; I can't tell which one is the thief with that kind of behavior."

<b>

Well, what I'm going to do is use them as a magical experimental subject.

But I wonder if there are any beautiful girl thieves around. As I explore the highway from the sky.

By the way, I'm just making a window while staying in the base room and peeking out. It should be easy to find thieves.

<b>

…Surprisingly, there aren't many that fit the bill.

<b>

"Hey Misha, I don't see any thieves around."

"Well, even if they were around, they'd just get attacked by monsters, and thieves usually act like villagers. There are many stories about thieves being part of a village, and they tend to do that as a side job when there's no farming to do, you know?"

"Seriously? If they're acting like villagers, I can't tell if they're thieves or not."

"To be honest, you can't really say they're thieves until they attack you, which is the troublesome part about thieves."

<b>

…It seems that there are few who are causing a ruckus like a typical band of thieves.

Moreover, those kinds of people also work as mercenaries when they're not stealing…

<b>

<b>

"Oh. By the way, in a sense, the demon tribe's folks are also thieves, right? We were drugged by them."

"Well, now that you mention it, that's true…"

<b>

That said, I can't bring myself to turn the demon tribe's folks into experimental subjects now.

They're already in my storage…

<b>

<b>

I need to somehow find a thief… It would be quick if there was one caught in the act somewhere.

<b>

"I guess I have no choice but to search the highway…?"

"Go ahead and contribute to maintaining public order."

<b>

Ideally, I would witness the moment they launch an attack.

If I can prevent that attack in advance and get the experimental subject without the victim noticing (as long as they're not a thief), it would be a wonderful world where no one gets hurt.

<b>

"By the way, Karina. Didn't you say you don't like men? Most thieves are men, you know?"

"Well, there's magic and all, so there can be female thieves too… right?"

"Even if there are, there's no way you'd find a beautiful girl to your taste. Those good-looking ones are either working as prostitutes or con artists in town."

<b>

That's true!?

<b>

"…My motivation just plummeted."

"Ah, but you know. There might be beautiful girls among the daughters of thieves or the slaves of thieves."

"Oh, tell me more."

"For example, if a thief attacks a noble's carriage? Let's say they capture a beautiful young lady. Even if they try to sell her, they definitely can't do it without getting caught, so they would take her back to their hideout and make her an illegal slave… and eventually, a child would be born… and it would be a beautiful girl resembling her mother… right?"

"Okay, I'm feeling motivated now, Misha! Let's contribute to improving public safety a bit!"

<b>

Thus, my thief hunting began.

<b>

<b>

…Ah, but this is a secret from Dia and the others!
