# To be honest, that idea is scary.

<blank>

I suddenly thought of a way to pass the time.

<blank>

Well, you know those bandits, right?"

You're here.

That's the kind of thing you can kill, right?"

Yes, she is.

'So if we catch him, doesn't that mean he's an experimental subject that we can use for whatever we want?

...... I think it's fine because what you're saying isn't wrong and no one is going to get in trouble, but frankly, the idea is scary."

<blank>

Good, if Misha says so, then there is no doubt about it.

So I decided to look for a bandit to get a 'person who can do anything' more than a slave.

<blank>

I'm going to do something that even Isiah can't do.

"Oh my God, he's acting like he doesn't know which one of us is the bandit."

<blank>

Well, what we do is experiment with magic and so on.

But if possible, I wonder if there are any beautiful girl bandits or something. And I will search the streets from the sky.

And, while in the room of the base, you just make a window and look through it. I thought it would be easy to find bandits.

<blank>

I'm not surprised ....... Someone who looks like that.

<blank>

Hey, Misha, I don't see anyone who looks like a bandit.

The most important thing to remember is that you can't be a thief in the village without being attacked by demons, and thieves usually work as villagers. There are a lot of stories about thieves taking over entire villages, and they do it as a side job when they don't have to work in the field, you know?"

I'm not sure if he's a bandit or not if he's just a regular villager. I don't know if he's a bandit or not if he's just a regular villager."

To tell the truth, you can't say you're a bandit until you've been attacked, and that's the trouble with bandits.

<blank>

It seems that there are a few guys who are running rampant in the so-called bandit-like fashion at .......

And when those guys aren't banditry, they're also working for mercenaries or something like that. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Oh. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a new one.　We were drugged."

Hmmm. I guess you could say that. ......"

<blank>

But I am not inclined to use the people of the demon village as experimental subjects of any kind.

That thing is already in my storage. ......

<blank>

<blank>

It would be a quicker story if we could somehow get the bandit ...... current, if he was around somewhere.

<blank>

I guess I'll just have to keep trying to find a street. ......?"

"Oh, oh, oh. I hope you'll help us maintain public order."

<blank>

It is also desirable to witness the moment of the attack by chance.

It is a wonderful world where no one (except the bandits) loses anything if the attack is prevented and only the experimental subjects are obtained before the victim is aware of anything.

<blank>

I mean, Karina. I thought you didn't like men.　I thought you said no men?

You see, there's magic and stuff there, and you can have a female bandit, right ......?"

Even if there is, there will never be a beautiful girl like you. If you like a girl with a nice face, she's either a whore or a swindler in town.

<blank>

Indeed!

<blank>

...... rapidly demotivated me."

Ah, but there it is. "Ah, but you know what? There might be beautiful girls who are the daughters of bandits or slaves of bandits.

"Well, in detail."

For example, a bandit attacks a nobleman's carriage.　If a beautiful young lady is caught, she will definitely be traced and cannot be sold. If they were to sell her, they would surely be traced back to her, so they would take her back to their hideout and turn her into an illegal slave ...... and eventually have a child ...... who is a beautiful girl like her mother....... What do you mean?"

I'm motivated now, Misha!　Let's do our part to improve public safety!"

<blank>

Thus began my hunt for bandits.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Oh, don't tell Deere and the others!

<blank>
