# I will teach you the language of my country

<blank>

Dear, good news!　Your sister seems to be safe!　I'll see you the day after tomorrow!"

What, really?

My off-loaf lens happened to be the mother of a lord. And she was on her way back to her country after being protected somehow."

I'm glad to hear that.""...... Oh, but without me, sister? But without me, sister?"

<blank>

Oops, this is sulking, isn't it?

I was worried about her, and she left without me! I was worried about myself, but my sister left without me!

<blank>

No, no, no!　Your sister didn't abandon you, Dear!　I'm not abandoned by my sister, Deere!　Well, it's my fault that my stealing was so perfect. ...... Sorry?"

Oh no!　Sister Karina did nothing wrong!"

<blank>

Well, it seems that if I hadn't messed with it, it would have been protected normally, and I might have taken care of it a little too much.

<blank>

Oh, yes, sister Karina. I found some things you could use."

Oh, like what?"

We didn't get all the evidence of wrongdoing, the money, and the furniture out of there, but we had a fair amount of it."

<blank>

Hmmm. As for the evidence, I'll give it to Grandma Maria as a gift. I am sure she will put it to good use.

<blank>

Oh, yeah, there was also a full-length mirror.

"Heh, it's a mirror, you know, the big one that shows your whole body."

Yes. I think it is a luxury item made by alchemy.

<blank>

Come to think of it, I don't look at myself too closely.

Since I saw it when God was making the body. When I look at it from my point of view, I can't see the bottom well because the breasts are in the way.

<blank>

Oh. Dear. Did you see yourself as a beautiful girl?　You saw it, right?"

"Well, I saw it at ....... So what?"

I think you're super cute!　Dear, you didn't think you were awesomely cute either!"

............'s, with no comment."

<blank>

Dia-kun turns red up to his ears when he says that. You thought you were cute, didn't you?

<blank>

'Where was it? ......Oh, there it is. Ei, pull it in."

<blank>

With a snap, he pulls out a pair of eyeglasses. It's a silver-plated glass mirror that reflects beautifully.

<blank>

Oh, I'm so well-rounded in appearance.

The face and body that God would look like if he were an adult. When I look in the mirror and see myself moving as I want, I realize that this is really who I am now.

<blank>

Huh?　Maybe I'm in a rather close situation with Mr. Dear right now?

I'm a man at heart and a woman at form, and I'm like, "Is this ...... me?" I am a man at heart and a woman in appearance.

<blank>

The only difference is that I can't go back to being a man in a completely girl's body anymore.

Hmmm. Well, okay, I'll take you along for the ride. I guess I'll just have to turn you into a girl now, won't I?

<blank>

<blank>

"Um, do I still have to dress like this?"

I'm so cute, please dress me like that. You're so cute, please dress like that."

I'm a man. ......

'Hmph, such a Dear, I'll teach you the language of my country--Repeat After Me. Cross-dressing is the most manly thing only a man can do!"

Girl, cross-dressing is the most manly thing that only a man can do......!"

<blank>

Mr. Dia is surprised at the stray words of our country Japan.

Yes, you are doing a very manly deed right now!　Be proud!　But also feel shame!

<blank>

No, I won't be fooled!"

I know, right?"

<blank>

It's like saying that being a girl in TS is the most manly thing you can do. I'd probably punch him in the face.

<blank>

'Oh, and the reason I'm having Deere dress up as a girl right now is an important point related to the work the ...... gods have asked me to do.'

"......!　What is the point of me dressing up as a girl?"

I can't tell you that. But I can tell you, Dear, that your embarrassment is not in vain!　Just remember that!"

<blank>

After all, shame is God's demand!　Don't reopen this and be ashamed!

<blank>

<blank>

But still, a figurehead, huh?

Oh, yes. I'm going to ask you to do something to make you feel shame and to make you more like a man's daughter.

<blank>

Dear boy. Say pretty to yourself in this mirror!"

What?　Why did you have to do that!"

Please!"

Ugh, ugh ............ or the lovely ......."

<blank>

Dia-kun is shy but says as requested. He is so cute.

<blank>

Look at yourself again. Dear, be confident that you're pretty!"

Or the lovely ......."

Keep saying it?

"Cute, cute, cute."

'You're much prettier than a regular girl, aren't you, as I'd expect from an elf?　No, it's because it's you, Dear."

"Cute ......"

I'm in love with her. Such a pretty girl is you, Dear. Do you understand?"

"Uh."

Tell him he's cute."

Or cute."

<blank>

People have such a propensity to recognize the words they utter as "so it is".

It is what we call the spirit of speech.

In other words, if you keep saying pretty to the mirror, Dear, you will sincerely think you are pretty--and you will be.

<blank>

Isn't this a brainwashing technique?

"Oops. You knew exactly what you were doing, Deere."

I'm rather surprised that Karina knew about it!　Were you in some secret service?

<blank>

Hmmm, failure failure. Teh heh!

Oh, but seriously, Dear, you're so cute. I'm starting to think you're hot. ...... Hmm?　Am I the one being influenced by the words while I'm praising Deer-kun?

Well, that's okay. He's actually cute. I don't want to grow up to be a man in the future, but I think I'd look good as an elf. I don't know much about elves, but there's a chance they'll stay young until I reach the end of my life!

<blank>

'That's that, Dear. After all, the pirates have been vanquished, and I'm sure you'll be reunited with your sister, too!　That's why we're celebrating today!　Let's go out to eat!"

'You blatantly diverted the conversation!　Hey, sister!"

Don't worry about the details!　Don't worry, I've got a pirate's money, I'll buy you a drink!　Let's celebrate!　Let's celebrate!"

I'll take a look at "...... mmmm. I understand. But I'll talk to you thoroughly later!"

<blank>

So I decided to take Dear out to eat.

...... In addition, Dear seems to have inadvertently forgotten that she is currently wearing a very cute one-piece dress. I was aware of it, but of course I kept quiet about it.
