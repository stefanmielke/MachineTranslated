# Let me teach you the language of my country

<b>

"Dear-kun, great news! My sister seems to be safe! We should be able to meet the day after tomorrow!"

"Really!?"

"My offuro friends happened to be the lord's mother. And it seems she was being protected and was about to return to the country."

"…Ah, that's good. But, my sister is leaving me behind, right?"

<b>

Oh, looks like he's sulking, huh?

It's like he's thinking, "Even though I was worried, my sister is leaving me behind!"

<b>

"That's not it! It's not that my sister abandoned me, Dear-kun! It's just that there were no leads regarding your exploration, so it couldn't be helped, right? Well, it's my perfect thieving skills that are to blame... Sorry, okay?"

"That's not true! Karina-onee-san is not at fault at all!"

<b>

Well, if I hadn't meddled, she probably would have been safely protected, so I might have overstepped a bit.

<b>

"Oh, by the way, Karina-onee-san. There were various useful things."

"Oh, what kind?"

"Evidence indicating various wrongdoings, money, and although I couldn't carry out any furniture, there were quite a few things."

<b>

Hmm, hmm. I'll gift the evidence to Maria-baa. I'm sure she'll use it well.

<b>

"By the way, there was also a full-length mirror."

"Oh, a mirror, a large one that reflects the whole body."

"Yes. I think it's a high-quality item made through alchemy."

<b>

Speaking of which, I haven't really seen my own appearance clearly.

It's been since the god made my body. From my perspective, my chest gets in the way, so I can't see below well.

<b>

"Oh. Dear-kun. Have you seen your beautiful girl form? You have, right?"

"Um... I-I have, but what about it?"

"Isn't it super cute!? Didn't you think you were really cute too!?"

"…………N-no comment."

<b>

Saying that, Dear-kun's ears turn bright red. He must think he's cute too!

<b>

"Where was it? ...Oh, there it is. Hey, come here."

<b>

With a pop, I pull the mirror to my side. It's a beautifully reflecting type with a glass and silver plating.

<b>

Oh, I have a well-proportioned appearance.

This is what the god would look like when grown up, a face and body like this. Seeing myself move as I wish in the mirror makes me realize that this is really me now.

<b>

Huh? Could it be that I'm relatively close to Dear-kun's current state??

A heart of a boy, a body of a girl, and thinking, "Is this... me?" in that regard.

<b>

The only difference is that I am now completely in a girl's body and can't go back to being a boy.

Hmm. Well, it's fine to have a companion. At this point, I have to turn Dear-kun into a girl too, right?

<b>

<b>

"Um, do I still have to stay in this outfit?"

"Yes. You're super cute, so please stay in that outfit."

"But I'm a boy..."

"Hehe, I'll teach you the language of my country, Dear-kun—repeat after me. Cross-dressing is the most manly act that only a man can do!"

"Cross-dressing is the most manly act that only a man can do...!?"

<b>

Dear-kun is surprised by the absurd saying from my country, Japan.

Yes, you are currently doing a very manly act! Be proud! But also feel embarrassed!

<b>

"No, I won't be fooled!?"

"Right?"

<b>

Saying that becoming a girl through TS is the most manly thing is the same. I might punch someone for that.

<b>

"Ah, and the reason I'm having you dress as a girl right now is... it's an important point related to a job requested by the god."

"…! Wh-what does it mean for me to dress as a girl?"

"I can't say. But remember that the embarrassing feelings you have are never in vain! Just keep that in mind!"

<b>

After all, the sense of shame is what the god desires! Keep feeling embarrassed without giving up!

<b>

<b>

By the way, a full-length mirror, huh.

Oh, right. To provoke his sense of shame and help Dear-kun become more of a boy's daughter, I think I'll have him do something.

<b>

"Dear-kun, try saying 'cute' to the reflection of yourself in this mirror!"

"Wha!? Why do I have to do something like that!?"

"Please!"

"Ugh, ugh... c-cute..."

<b>

Even while feeling shy, Dear-kun says it as requested. So cute.

<b>

"Now, look at your reflection properly and say it again. Be confident that Dear-kun is cute!"

"C-cute..."

"Keep saying it?"

"C-c-cute..."

"You're way cuter than an ordinary girl, right? As expected of an elf? No, it's because you're Dear-kun."

"Cute..."

"You'll be captivated. Such a cute child is Dear-kun. Do you understand?"

"Um..."

"Say cute."

"C-cute."

<b>

People have a tendency to recognize the words they say as "that's right."

It's what you call kotodama.

In other words, if Dear-kun keeps saying cute in front of the mirror, he'll come to genuinely think of himself as cute—

<b>

"Wait, isn't this a brainwashing technique!?"

"Oh, you know it well, Dear-kun."

"Rather, I'm surprised that Karina-onee-san knows! Were you in some intelligence agency or something!?"

<b>

Hmm, failure, failure. Oops!

Ah, but seriously, Dear-kun is cute. I'm starting to feel like I can go for it... Huh? Am I getting influenced by the words while complimenting Dear-kun?

Well, it's fine. He's really cute. I might not like it if he becomes manly in the future, but I feel like an elf could pull it off. I don't know much about elves, but there's a possibility he could remain youthful until I reach the end of my lifespan!

<b>

"That aside, Dear-kun. We've defeated the pirates and it seems like we can reunite with my sister! So let's celebrate today! Let's go eat out!"

"You just blatantly changed the subject, didn't you!? Hey, onee-san!"

"Don't worry about the details! It's fine, we have the pirates' money, so I'll treat you! Come on! Let's celebrate!"

"…Hmm. I understand. But we will have a serious talk later!"

<b>

So, I decided to take Dear-kun out to eat.

...Although, it seems Dear-kun had forgotten, but his current outfit is a very cute dress. I was fully aware of it, but of course, I kept quiet.
