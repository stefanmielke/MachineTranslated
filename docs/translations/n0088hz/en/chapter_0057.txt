# You're probably right. (Former Lord's wife's point of view)

The day after tomorrow the elf girl will be here, so come again. Come to the front this time."

Yeah, I'll see you later."

<blank>

With a flutter of her hand, "Kari-chan" disappeared.

Just as when they appeared, they did so suddenly and without warning.

<blank>

Dear Marie-Abelle.

<blank>

The maid of honor calls out to me, but I gently tell her with a sign from the soiree with my hand that she should not relax yet.

<blank>

"...... totally shortens your lifespan. I don't want them showing up out of the blue."

'Dear Marie-Abelle, Oh no, please don't die!　Or should I say?"

"Ha, I'll live another 35 years. No worries."

I'm sure it was 40 years when I asked you before, so you've shortened it by five years. What a surprise."

<blank>

Inside the lord's castle, she suddenly appeared in front of us without a sound. Even the maidens, who are good at detecting signs, felt a sense of discomfort just before she appeared. It was only when she actually appeared that we finally realized it was an intruder.

That is, 'they can unilaterally monitor us at any time.

<blank>

As long as we are talking about her, we can't let our guard down. We should be on high alert for a while, on par with a night party - your wife's battlefield.

At least until the deal with the elves is done.

The maidens seemed to get it, too.

<blank>

<blank>

As it was, he informed the soldiers that the search for the elves was no longer necessary and that they should return to the escort unit that was transporting the elves. After finishing this, he finally returned to his room - and once again activated his anti-eavesdropping magical device.

<blank>

Maybe it's comforting, but let's talk about it once and for all."

"Dear Marie-Abelle. Who the hell is that?"

<blank>

The other day in the public bathhouse, I laughed and washed every inch of her body. I thought that she was naive enough not to know that I was the wife of a former lord - well, she was a country commoner, but I had no idea that she was such an important person.

<blank>

'You have heard that the Alchemy Kingdom was destroyed.　They said the capital was destroyed in one night, and it took seven days and seven nights to polish it off. I don't want to be like that."

It means..."

'It's probably best not to pry. Kari, Grandma Maria, and the old ladies. That's all right. That's the way it's going to be. Okay?"

"...... okay, so?"

<blank>

An anxious maid of honor. But there is no better relationship.

If that "Kari-chan" is the one who destroyed the alchemy kingdom - the position of a friend who can easily talk with that person, and the position of just a former lord's wife.

It's easy to see which one is better.

<blank>

However, this "hypothetically" could be taken away.

When I came-over, he clearly knew what was going on in the alchemy kingdom. And there were no surprises at all on top of that. In other words, he was a party to it, that boy.

<blank>

He also has the military might to destroy the divine vessel "Poseidon" at sea. It is impossible for a man to cut a ship in half, which is supposed to be protected by the blessings of the gods.

<blank>

<blank>

--that's just the way it is now. The evidence is too circumstantial.

<blank>

<blank>

It's all right. From my point of view, she is basically a good person. As long as we don't treat him maliciously, he won't harm us.

...... could have decimated the pirates directly under the lords?"

I was on the verge of getting rid of that one because I'd gone too far. It saved me a lot of trouble, you know. Right?"

Oh. That's right."

<blank>

When I remind her, she replies with a smile.

He had meddled with the elves and tried to attack a ship with permission, even though his cargo had been stolen, which was actually overkill. Besides, at sea, they are a troublesome force that even the lords cannot touch due to the divine weapon "Poseidon".

So it's really true that I'm glad to have saved you the trouble.

<blank>

<blank>

'Oh, yes. I think my son might have inadvertently misunderstood. Herza, just in case. Make sure he knows."

"Certainly, Mademoiselle Marie-Abelle."

<blank>

With that, he sends his lady-in-waiting, Herza, to advise his son, who is a lord.

Don't go against them, they are the ones who will destroy you if you go against them. The other party is the entity that wiped out the Alchemy Kingdom from this continent. And that we should not think of any retaliation and should not force them to do anything.

<blank>

<blank>

Hey Teresa. Did you smell any elves on that girl?"

Yes. Yes, and quite intensely, too. Also, they probably shared a bedchamber together. I have no doubt that she smelled that strong odor, even though I washed her thoroughly the other day."

"Ah, ......, so that's how it is. Oh dear, how did I explain that to them?"

<blank>

Theresa, the maid of honor, who has Blutbad blood in her veins, has a very good nose. Her sense of smell has often saved her from being poisoned, a nose worth trusting.

Since Teresa assured me that this was the case, it must be so. I would be surprised if it was just the two of us wrapped in a blanket that had not been washed for a long time and fell asleep together.

<blank>

<blank>

That's why you can't quit life. I'm going to live another 50 years.

Oh," he said, "have you grown back? Have you grown back?"

If you suck the energy out of young people, you will exceed your life expectancy. Remember that in another 20 years, you will too.

<blank>

I've become friends with a very troublesome being.

I guess as long as we are ...... friends, it will remain reassuring, though.

<blank>

I'll ask him what to do about the former site of the Alchemy Kingdom.
