# It’s probably not a mistake. (Perspective of the former lord's wife)

<b>

<b>

"An elf girl will probably come the day after tomorrow, so come again. This time, come from the front."

"Okay, see you later!"

<b>

Waving her hand, 'Kari-chan' disappeared.

Just like when she appeared, without any warning, she vanished suddenly.

<b>

"Lady Mariabelle."

<b>

The maid called out to me, but I gently signaled with my hand to not let our guard down yet, using the sign from the ball.

<b>

"…Really, my lifespan is shortening. I can't stand sudden appearances."

"Lady Mariabelle, should I say something like, 'Please don't die!'?"

"Hah, I’ll live for another 35 years. Don't worry."

"Hmm, indeed, when I heard before it was 40 years, so it’s shortened by 5 years. What a thing."

<b>

Inside the lord's castle, that girl appeared before us silently and suddenly. Even the maid, who is good at sensing presence, only felt a slight discomfort just before. It was only when she actually showed up that we realized she was an intruder.

This meant that 'they can monitor us unilaterally at any time.'

<b>

Since we are talking about her, we cannot let our guard down carelessly. For a while, we should maintain a state of alert equivalent to the ball— the battlefield of noble ladies.

At least until the dealings with the elves are over.

It seems the maids understood that as well.

<b>

<b>

I then conveyed to the soldiers that the search for the elves was no longer necessary and instructed them to return to the escort unit transporting the elves. After finishing that, I finally returned to my room— and once again activated the anti-eavesdropping magical tool.

<b>

"It might be a comfort, but let’s talk for now."

"Lady Mariabelle. Who is that person?"

<b>

The girl I washed thoroughly while laughing at the public bath the other day. I thought it was understandable that she was ignorant of the world since she didn’t know I was the former lord's wife— being a country bumpkin commoner, after all— but I never expected her to be such an important person.

<b>

"You’ve heard that the Alchemy Kingdom was destroyed, right? The capital was annihilated in one night, ground to dust over seven days and nights. I don’t want to end up like that."

"That means..."

"It’s better not to pry. Kari-chan, Mariababa, Oba-chan, that’s fine, isn’t it? Let’s stick with that. Okay?"

"…Is that really okay?"

<b>

The maid looked anxious. However, the relationship we have is unparalleled.

If that 'Kari-chan' is the one who destroyed the Alchemy Kingdom— the position of being a friend who can talk casually with her and that of just a former lord's wife.

It’s easy to see which is superior.

<b>

However, this "if" can be discarded.

When I tested her, it was clear she knew the circumstances of the Alchemy Kingdom. Moreover, she showed no surprise at all. In other words, she is one of the parties involved.

<b>

Also, she possesses the military power to destroy the divine artifact 'Poseidon' at sea. To split a ship that should have been protected by divine favor in half is something that humans cannot possibly do.

<b>

<b>

—That’s already the situation. The circumstantial evidence is too overwhelming.

<b>

<b>

"Don’t worry. In my estimation, that girl is fundamentally a good person. As long as we don’t approach her with malice, she won’t harm us either."

"…But she annihilated the lord’s direct pirates, didn’t she?"

"That was already excessive, so they were on the verge of being dealt with. It saved us some trouble. Isn’t that right?"

"Ah, that’s true."

<b>

When I pressed the point, the maid smiled back.

Even though they attacked a ship with permission after getting involved with the elves and losing their cargo, it was indeed excessive. Furthermore, at sea, the divine artifact 'Poseidon' makes it a troublesome force that even the lord cannot touch.

So, it’s truly a relief that it saved us some trouble.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, right. My son might have accidentally misunderstood. Helza, just to be safe, check with my son."

"Understood, Lady Mariabelle."

<b>

Saying that, I sent maid Helza to warn my son, the lord.

Do not oppose; if you do, you will be destroyed. The other party is the one who erased the Alchemy Kingdom from this continent. And do not think of any retaliation, do not force anything.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, Teresa. Did you smell the scent of elves from that girl?"

"Yes. Quite strongly. Also, it seems she may have shared a bed with them. Despite having washed her thoroughly the other day, that intense smell is undeniable."

"Ah… so that’s how it is. Goodness, how should I explain that to them?"

<b>

The maid Teresa, who has wolf beastman blood, has an excellent sense of smell. Thanks to her keen sense of smell, she has often avoided poisoning, making her a trustworthy nose.

Since Teresa asserts it, it must be true. If it turned out they just wrapped themselves in an unwashed blanket and slept together, that would be surprising.

<b>

<b>

"This is why I can’t quit life. I’ll live for another 50 years."

"Oh? Have you extended your lifespan?"

"When you absorb the energy of the youth, you surpass your lifespan. You’ll find that out in another 20 years."

<b>

Really, I’ve ended up becoming friends with a troublesome existence.

…As long as we remain friends, it’s probably a reassuring thing.

<b>

Since it’s a good opportunity, I wonder if I should ask what to do about the ruins of the Alchemy Kingdom.
