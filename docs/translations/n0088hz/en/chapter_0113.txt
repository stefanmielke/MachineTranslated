# Log cabin in the woods is freaky.

<blank>

So once again we came to the dungeon forest.

<blank>

When you follow the path of the dense forest and the occasional sun-dappled patch, you will be attacked by insect-type monsters.

I think that since it is a forest, monsters other than insects should be more likely to attack. Maybe some plants or animals. Are there any gorillas in this forest?

<blank>

It is too much trouble to cut down the path we are on, so we are plowing through the guns in a state of invincibility.

I looked back and saw the path I had taken. The forest stands in front of me and the road is made after me. ......

<blank>

I thought I was walking in a straight line, but I was turning around a lot. I thought I was walking in a straight line, but this is not it.

<blank>

The footprints I walked on were indeed straight. But the trees were moving in a way that hid the path.

I approach that tree and slap it flat. Oh, come on. You can move, can't you?　The seedpod is cracked. ...... Trent, right, buddy?　I didn't know you could get torrent wood here!

<blank>

Lumberjack Karina, you're up!　Let's go felling!

<blank>

Splash!　When the tree was cut down with spatial magic, the surrounding trees moved in a frightened manner.

Aaahhhh?　All the ones that just moved are torrents, right?　There's quite a few of them.

<blank>

I smiled, and the torrents rudely tried to distance themselves from me with a rustle. Come on, why is a monster that should be attacking intruders so run-down? I don't know if torrents have hips.

<blank>

He who runs away is a Trent, and he who doesn't run away is a well-trained Trent!"

<blank>

With that said, they cut them down at will from the nearby torrents. Oh, a group of Red Hornet. Could it be that we are in the depths here?　Oops, a red praying mantis. He was there yesterday, too, though that was a different individual. Ah, a big centipede. I have never seen you before. Here you go.

<blank>

Even the slightly stronger-looking insect monsters that come by are reaped from one end to the other while torrenting.

Once knocked down, it pops into the storage space and disappears, so it does not interfere with scaffolding.

<blank>

<blank>

Then I noticed that there was an open space with bare soil.

The area is quite large. The sky looks so beautiful because there are no trees. ......Yeah, it might be fun to build a log cabin here in Trento. ......No, I'm not going to do that. From Trent's side, it's diabolical to pile up the corpses of his friends in front of him and play with them.

<blank>

A log cabin in the woods is a common sight, but from the tree's point of view it's a little bizarre."

<blank>

Muttering to myself, I sat down on Trent's stump. Ah, the dense forest has been cut away and I can see the clear blue sky clearly. What's going on here?　I wonder if the sky is really empty.

<blank>

I was so curious that I decided to float up to the sky to take a look.

But after floating a few meters, he suddenly senses danger and stops.

<blank>

...... Oh?　There's a ceiling. Hmm?　What the hell is this guy?

<blank>

I can't see it. It's a transparent ceiling, and I tap it. It is definitely a ceiling. And the touch was a rock. If I had jumped up without noticing, I would have hit my head and it would have hurt. The ceiling.

I thought it would be possible to smash through the dungeon, but that would mean smashing through the walls and ceilings of the dungeon. If there were people above us, they would fall in and it would be troublesome, so let's not do that.

<blank>

Apparently this is just a fixed space, the sky is like a VR reproduction, or something like that. ...... Hmmm, I guess I could do some spatial magic. I had thought about at least making windows to let in sunlight, but I hadn't thought enough to create a space that reproduces the environment so well. I'm learning a lot.

<blank>

I'll try to build a swimming beach where people can sunbathe inside the storage space. I would love to see Dia in a girl's swimsuit. Bikinis are good, but I prefer one-piece type. It looks more like a girl. It should have a flutter that just barely hides the bulge between the legs.

<blank>

<blank>

And a sign of someone coming to the square I cut out. It's not a monster. Adventurers?

This is not good. If they find out I've been on a solo rampage, I'll be in a lot of trouble. Let's quietly escape.

<blank>

"Let's see, where's the way to the back?"

<blank>

I floated in the air, concealing my figure with optical camouflage, and searched for a path that would lead me deeper into the dungeon.
