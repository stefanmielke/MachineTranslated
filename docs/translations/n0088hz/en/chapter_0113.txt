# A log house in the forest is quite macabre

<b>

So, I've come back to the dungeon forest once again.

<b>

As I progress through the densely overgrown forest, following the occasional sunny spot, insect-type monsters attack me.

Since it's a forest, I think it would be nice if more monsters besides insects would attack, like plant-type or animal-type. Are there no gorillas in this forest?

<b>

It's too much trouble to clear the path, so I'm charging through in an invincible state.

When I look back, the path I took has become a road. The forest stands in my way, and a path forms behind me...!

<b>

"Wait, I thought I was walking straight, but I'm veering quite a bit. Oh, no, that's not it."

<b>

The footprints I left are indeed straight. However, the trees were moving to hide the path.

I approached the tree and gave it a few slaps. Hey, you! You can move, right? The seed is cracked... You're a treant, aren't you? So this place can yield treant wood too!

<b>

"It's time for lumberjack Karina-chan to shine!! Hyahha, let's chop some wood!"

<b>

Swoosh! I cut down the tree with spatial magic, and the surrounding trees moved as if trembling in fear.

Aha? All those that moved just now are treants, right? There are quite a few of them.

<b>

When I smiled, the rude treants tried to distance themselves from me with a rustle. Hey, hey, why are the monsters that should be attacking the intruder so timid? I don't even know if treants have waists.

<b>

"Those who run are treants, and those who don't run are well-trained treants!"

<b>

Saying that, I began cutting down the nearby treants indiscriminately. Oh, a group of red hornets. Could this be the deeper part of the forest? Oh, look, a red mantis. It was here yesterday too, but that's a different individual. Ah, a big centipede. You're a first-timer. Here you go, chopped up.

<b>

I also mowed down the slightly stronger insect monsters that approached, taking them down along with the treants.

Once defeated, they disappear into my storage space, so they don't obstruct my footing.

<b>

<b>

Before I knew it, a wide-open area with bare soil had formed.

It's quite spacious. Without trees, the sky looks beautiful. ...Hmm, it might be interesting to build a log house here with treants... No, on second thought, that would be a heinous act of playing with the corpses of comrades right in front of them.

<b>

"Log houses in the forest are a common sight, but from the perspective of the trees, it seems a bit macabre."

<b>

Muttering such a monologue, I sat on a treant stump. Ah, the once dense forest has been cleared, and I can see the clear blue sky well. What's going on here? Is it really empty up there?

<b>

Curious, I decided to float up and take a look at the sky.

However, after rising a few meters, I suddenly felt danger and stopped.

<b>

...Oh? There's a ceiling. Hmm? What on earth is this?

<b>

I tapped on the invisible, transparent ceiling. It's definitely a ceiling. Moreover, it feels like rock when I touch it. If I had jumped up without noticing, I would have hit my head and it would have hurt. The ceiling.

I thought about breaking through it, but that would mean breaking through the dungeon's walls and ceiling. If there were people above, it would lead to troublesome situations, so I should refrain.

<b>

It seems this is a fixed space, and the sky is like a VR recreation, something like that. ...Hmm, I could probably do something with spatial magic. I had thought about making a window to let in sunlight, but I hadn't considered creating a space that fully recreates the environment. This is a learning experience.

<b>

Next time, I should try to create a seaside resort in my storage space where I can sunbathe. I want to admire Dia-kun in a girlâ€™s swimsuit. A bikini is nice, but I prefer a one-piece type. It looks more girlish. A fluttering design that barely hides the bulge in the groin area would be ideal.

<b>

<b>

Just then, I sensed someone approaching the clearing I had opened up. It's not a monster. An adventurer?

This is bad; if they find out I've been rampaging solo, it could lead to all sorts of trouble. I should quietly escape.

<b>

"Um, where's the path leading deeper in?"

<b>

I hid my appearance with optical camouflage while floating in the air and searched for the path leading deeper into the dungeon.
