# What?　Sending wolf?

<blank>

I leave Mashiro and return to the inn.

I could have used the transfer magic to return to the base, but since I had come all this way, I decided to walk home.

<blank>

However, although I had found a sacred object, I could not get it. Too bad.

I can't do something like destroying a town, can I? Karina, you may look like a pacifist, but you're a pacifist.

<blank>

So, I am willing to look for something else divine. I can get some information from Grandma Maria, but maybe I should be the one to look for it.

But frankly speaking, I don't think I can find out more about her than Grandma Maria. Grandma Maria is the former wife of the former lord's wife, and she has all kinds of contacts. She would be able to hear rumors much more extensively than me, who is a user of spatial magic.

As I was thinking about this as I walked along, I noticed that there was some kind of commotion around me. There seemed to be some kind of fight going on. What is it?　I'll be an onlooker too.

<blank>

"You're a fool to lay a hand on my daughter!　Hey!

I said, "Shut up!　Stepfather, give me your daughter!"

You're not going to do it!　You're gonna have to beat me first, you little fish!"

<blank>

Oh, a courtship ceremony. I like it!

An old man who looked like a bar owner, a full-bodied, fluffy tiger, and a pissed-off, adventurer-like man with bear ears were beating each other up. It was a beastly battle. Nice.

In case you're wondering, the one who is courting is the bear-eared adventurer.

<blank>

Oh, are you also taking bets on who will win?　I like mofu mofu, so I'll bet on the old man. Give me a bite.

<blank>

Dad!　There!　Belly, hang in there!　Now, let's see who's going to win!　I'm almost done with you two, so don't fall over either of you until then!

<blank>

And the tiger-eared girl who is fighting with him seems to be the betting man.

I hear if you win the bet, you get one drink per sip. Either way, that's sales, tough guy.

<blank>

Kasha!　So I tell you every time, don't bet against your father!"

Haha, I'll go easy on you until then if Kasha says so!"

What?　You can't lick me!

<blank>

A blow from the old tiger caught the bear-eared man in the jaw, and the bear man was punched away.

<blank>

I'm not going to let you go easy on me!　You're a hundred years too old to go easy on me!"

Ugh, ugh ......"

<blank>

Bear-eared man, down! ...... One, two, three!　Kankan kankan!　Settlement!

<blank>

Hey, is this kind of thing an everyday occurrence?"

"Yeah, rather. Here, every time there's a marriage proposal, the father defends it."

<blank>

Hmmm. You're doing well, aren't you? I mean, is she really being courted that much? She's very popular, isn't she?

Anyway, I won the bet and was treated to a round of drinks at the bar. Tsk.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

"Hey, isn't that Karina? What, are you drinking?"

Huh?　It's Mr. Masirow. Yoo-hoo!"

<blank>

I was taking a walk with Fluffy and was approached by Masilo.

<blank>

I'm busy with all kinds of things here, but I'm not that busy. Yeah, they'll have someone who knows more about bombs look into it tomorrow.

I see.

I'm totally drunk. Are you okay with ......?"

I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm the greatest, I'm the greatest, I'm the greatest, I'm the greatest ......?　Did I get the order wrong? ...... Anyway, all is well."

I guess not. Hey, which way to the inn?　I'll give you a ride."

What?　A sentinel wolf?　Just because you're a Blutbad?　Ehehe."

<blank>

And Masilo-san lends me his shoulder.

Oh, but Mr. Masilo is not tied to Carina the Adventurer, is he?

That means we can't just go back to the inn like this, right?

<blank>

Can I stay over tonight ......?"

"An?　I don't care."

I'm going to sleep with Masilo tonight!　I'm going to mooch off Mr. Masilo tonight and go to bed!"

I'd say give me a break on that. ...... Well, okay."

<blank>

<blank>

Thus, I spent the night at Masilo's house. Hiccup.

Needless to say, I had to get down on my knees to Mr. Masilo first thing in the morning the next morning.
