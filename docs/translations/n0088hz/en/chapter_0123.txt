# Huh? A Sending Wolf?

<b>

After parting with Mashiro-san, I returned to the inn.

I could have used teleportation magic to return to my base, but since I came all the way here, I decided to walk back.

<b>

However, even though I found a divine artifact, I couldn't obtain it. What a shame.

I can't just destroy a whole town, after all. Karina-chan may look like this, but she's a pacifist, you know?

<b>

So, I want to look for another divine artifact. I can get information from Maria-baa, but it might be better for me to search on my own.

But honestly, I don't feel like I can investigate better than Maria-baa. She's a big shot as the former lord's wife and has various connections. She probably hears rumors much more widely than I do as a user of spatial magic.

<b>

While I was thinking about such things and walking around aimlessly, I noticed that the surroundings were quite noisy. It seemed like there was a fight going on. Huh, what's happening? I want to be a bystander too.

<b>

"Hey, you! How dare you lay a hand on my daughter! Come on!"

"Shut up! Father-in-law, give your daughter to me!"

"Bring it on, you fool! Talk after you defeat me, you weakling!"

<b>

Oh, a marriage proposal ceremony, huh? Nice!

A fluffy tiger man who looks like a tavern owner and a muscular adventurer with bear ears were fighting. It's a beastman battle. Good stuff.

Just to clarify, the one proposing is the bear-eared adventurer.

<b>

Oh, are they also betting on who will win? I like fluffiness, so I'll bet on the old man. Give me a piece of that.

<b>

"Dad! Over there! Berry, do your best! Now, let's see who wins! Both of you, don't fall down until the deadline!"

<b>

And it seems that the tiger-eared daughter is acting as the bookmaker for the bets.

If you win the bet, you can drink one cup of alcohol for each bet placed. Either way, it's profit, how resourceful.

<b>

"Karsha! I've told you many times not to make your father the betting target!"

"Hahaha, if Karsha says so, I'll hold back until then!"

"Huh? You think you can underestimate me, huh?!"

<b>

The tiger man's punch caught the bear-eared man's jaw, and the bear man was knocked away.

<b>

"Gahaha! It's a hundred years too early for you to hold back against me!"

"Ugh...!"

<b>

Bear-eared man, down! ...One, two, three! Ding ding ding! Match over!

<b>

"Hey, is this kind of thing a daily occurrence?"

"Yeah, pretty much. Here, every time there's a proposal, the old man has to defend himself."

<b>

Hmm. That's lively. I mean, is she really proposed to that often? That girl must be quite popular.

Anyway, having won the bet, I was treated to a drink at the tavern. Hiccup.

<b>

"Hey, isn't that Karina? What’s up, drinking?"

"Eh? Mashiro-san! Hello!"

<b>

While I was wandering around, I was called out by Mashiro-san.

<b>

"Geez, I'm busy with various things, and you're just carefree. Oh, it seems someone will investigate the bomb in detail tomorrow."

"Is that so?"

"You're completely drunk, huh? ...Are you okay?"

"I'm totally fine, I'm the best, invincible, giant... huh? Did I mix up the order? Anyway, I'm fine!"

"It doesn't seem like it. Hey, which way is the inn? I'll take you there."

"Eh? A sending wolf? Just because you're a wolf beastman? Ehehe."

<b>

With that, Mashiro-san lent me his shoulder.

Wait, but I haven't connected Mashiro-san with the adventurer Karina-chan.

Does that mean if I go back to the inn like this, it would be bad?

<b>

"Can I stay over tonight...?"

"Huh? I don't mind."

"Yay! Tonight, I'm going to cuddle with Mashiro-san while I sleep!"

"I'd like to say please don't, but... well, whatever."

<b>

<b>

Thus, I spent the night at Mashiro-san's house. Hiccup.

The next morning, it goes without saying that I had to apologize to Mashiro-san first thing.
