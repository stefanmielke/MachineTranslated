# Building a base

<blank>

<blank>

I'm Karina. I'm shopping!

With a budget of two silver coins, I wonder what wonderful things I can buy!

<blank>

So first we bought a used backpack, a leather backpack.

Price 1 silver coin.

<blank>

...... half of our budget gone as soon as possible?

<blank>

<blank>

It was a disguise for getting things in and out, but bags in this world are expensive.

No wonder they are expensive, though, since they are not factory-made or anything. But I can't believe it's used.

The old man at the store also said that two large silver coins are lightweight items when new. He was very good at sales talk, saying that they were soft and easy to use because they had been used for many years.

<blank>

Well, I bought one big enough to be a peddler as it is, so I guess I'll get my money's worth.

<blank>

I looked closely and saw a hole. ......

<blank>

The corners were frayed and there was a hole just big enough for my index finger to go through. Hmmm, well, it looks fine if you want to put something somewhat large in there, but is this ...... going to tear from here and the bottom will fall out?

...... if it was close to being scrapped as a bag?　I guess that's why I was able to buy it for a single silver coin. Junk so to speak.

<blank>

But in my case, it's the storage space that actually holds things anyway!　I do at least inflate it as a disguise.

<blank>

In the meantime, let's just use space magic to repair the holes. I'll duplicate the okay leather on the top in 5cm squares and paste it over.

It's easier than attaching arms because they're just textured. The leather is from the same bag, so the color is the same. The restoration is so perfect that if you look closely, you might be able to see the border.

The ...... duplication doesn't seem to be too much of a burden if it's just a haggling, and if I had more time, I could reinforce other parts of the backpack to make it a normal backpack.

<blank>

<blank>

'Maybe I should consider making a lot of this stuff myself.

<blank>

It is cheaper if you make it yourself. In fact, in Japan, it was often more expensive to make things, but in this world, it is definitely cheaper to make things yourself. There is also space magic.

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, that's right. Chairs and tables are easy to make with the space magic of cutting and pasting. If you want to make a wooden cup, you can easily make a cup too. I have some woodworking skills that my seniors taught me.

I can make the base of the bed out of wood, so all I need is a comforter or blanket to put on top of the bed. Since it's for my own use, it's okay to duplicate it to some extent!　Oh, but only for purchased items. You can't copy products for free.

<blank>

......I'll take the wood I get from the alchemy kingdom and use it as lumber for my own use."

<blank>

As I recall, when raw wood is dried, it shrinks and splits, so it can't be used as it is for lumber?

Well, we can just fix it with spatial magic as appropriate. It would be good to try anyway.

If we don't have enough wood, we can go back to the mountains and cut some more. After all, it's for me. Do whatever you want.

<blank>

<blank>

'Okay, then let's check how much fabric and cotton we can buy with the rest of our budget!'

<blank>

And food. As you can imagine, going without food is a miserable experience.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Cotton was pretty expensive. Hmmm, makes me want to buy some and duplicate it: ......

<blank>

On the other hand, wolves--wolf fur, tanned to the extent that it's tanned, turns out to be affordable: five large copper coins for one wolf. But one full of holes.

...... Is it possible to sell something this torn up?　Why are there so many holes in the first place? Is it used fur?

I wondered, so I asked the merchant's brother.

<blank>

Hey, why does it have all these holes in it?"

Yeah. It's an apprentice's practice piece. And there's not a lot of leather in good condition for an apprentice to practice on. Well, it's still better that it wasn't cut in half."

'Oh, that's one of those things. Do you sell ......?　Kore."

'There's a decent amount for one, and that's about it. Yeah, it's better to have a hole in it to hang it up and sleep in, right?　And you get all sweaty."

I see.

<blank>

That's what I heard. I couldn't find any clean ones for sale, but if there were any, they were worth several silver coins.

<blank>

But even with all the holes, it's a bargain for me.

Holes can be repaired with a simple "tchotchiki" (a little bit of space magic).

<blank>

I'll buy one then, and give me some dried meat too. I'll take one silver coin for the total."

"Thank you very much. You're a pretty girl, so I'll give you a little something extra."

'Oh, thanks. Your brother's a nice guy, I like generous guys."

Heh, I'll give you a little more for your money. Buy from us again.

<blank>

Yay, beautiful women are a bargain after all.

<blank>

In this world, however, the thread, scissors, and needles necessary to plug the holes are quite expensive. In Japan, these items can be easily obtained at a hundred-yen shop, but here, everything is handmade, so it is only natural. It would cost several silver coins just to get all the repair tools.

<blank>

Spatial magic is convenient in that it doesn't require such tools. It is truly divine.

<blank>

Oh. Well, where is the church?"

Hmm?　Then it's over there. It's a white-walled building, so you'll know it when you see it."

"Acknowledged."

<blank>

I decided to stop by the church to say hello to God.

I also want to give tribute (socks) to God.
