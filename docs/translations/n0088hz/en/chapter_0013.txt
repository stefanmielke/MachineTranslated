# Base Building

<b>

<b>

I'm Karina-chan. I'm shopping right now!

The budget is two silver coins. I wonder what wonderful things I can buy!

<b>

So first, I bought a used backpack, a leather rucksack.

The price was one silver coin.

<b>

...Half of my budget is gone already?

<b>

<b>

It was meant for disguising items, but bags in this world are expensive.

Well, I guess it's understandable since they aren't factory-produced. But still, this is quite a lot for a used one.

The shopkeeper also said that a new one would easily cost two large silver coins. He was good at sales talk, saying it was soft and easy to use because it had been used for many years.

<b>

Well, I bought a big enough one that I could probably make back the cost by becoming a traveling merchant.

<b>

"Wait, looking closely, there's a hole in it..."

<b>

The corner was frayed, and there was a hole big enough for my index finger to fit through. Hmm, well, it seems like it wouldn't be a problem if I put something fairly large in it, but this... could it tear and the bottom come out?

...Could it be that this bag was on the verge of being junk? Maybe that's why I could buy it for one silver coin. In other words, a junk item.

<b>

But for me, since I'm just going to use it for storage space anyway! I might inflate it a bit for disguise.

<b>

I'll go ahead and use space magic to repair the hole. I'll replicate a piece of the good leather from the top, 5 cm square, and stick it over the hole.

It's easier than attaching a limb randomly. Since it's the same bag, the color matches too. It’s a perfect repair to the point where you might notice the seam if you look closely.

...It seems that replicating small pieces doesn't put much burden on me, so if I have time, it might be nice to reinforce other parts and make it a usable rucksack.

<b>

<b>

"I should consider making various things myself."

<b>

If I make it myself, it will be cheaper. In Japan, it often turned out to be more expensive to make things for various reasons, but in this world, it's definitely cheaper to make things myself. Especially with space magic.

<b>

<b>

Yeah, that's right. For chairs and tables, I can easily make them with space magic by cutting and pasting. If it's wooden, I can easily make cups too. I also have the woodworking skills I learned from my senior.

I can also make a bed frame out of wood, so all that's left is the bedding or blankets to put on top of the bed. Since it's for myself, I can replicate it to some extent! Oh, but it has to be limited to the items I purchased. I can't just copy products for free.

<b>

"......I'll use the wood I got from the Alchemy Kingdom as my personal lumber."

<b>

I remember that fresh wood shrinks and cracks when it dries, so I can't just use it as lumber, right?

Well, I can just fix it with space magic as needed. For now, I should just give it a try.

If I don't have enough lumber, I can just go back to the mountains and chop some more. After all, it's for myself. I can do as I please.

<b>

<b>

"Alright, let's check how much fabric or cotton I can buy with the remaining budget!"

<b>

And food too. I can't go without meals.

<b>

<b>

Cotton was quite expensive. Hmm, I want to buy a little and replicate it...

<b>

On the other hand, I found out that I could buy wolf—wolf fur tanned to a certain extent at a reasonable price. Five large copper coins for one pelt. However, it was full of holes.

...Can something this ragged really be sold? Why is it full of holes in the first place? Is it second-hand fur?

I wondered, so I asked the merchant brother.

<b>

"Hey, why are there so many holes in this?"

"Oh, that's because it's a practice piece from an apprentice. Also, there aren't many good condition leathers for apprentice practice. Those holes were probably made by an arrow or something when it was hunted. Well, it's better than being cut in half."

"Oh, so that's how it is... Can this be sold?"

"It has enough quantity for one pelt, so it's decent. Plus, having holes is just right for covering up when sleeping, right? You get all sweaty."

"I see."

<b>

So that's how it is. They didn't have any in good condition, but if they did, it would cost several silver coins.

<b>

However, even with all the holes, it's a good deal for me.

I can easily repair the holes with space magic.

<b>

"Then I'll buy one, and also some dried meat, please. That'll be one silver coin in total."

"Thank you. Since you're a beautiful lady, I'll give you a little discount."

"Oh, thanks. You're a nice guy, I like generous people."

"Hehe, I'll give you a bit more next time. Be sure to buy from me again."

<b>

Yay, being beautiful really pays off.

<b>

Still, in this world, the thread, scissors, and needles needed to close the holes are quite expensive. In Japan, I could easily get those at a hundred yen shop, but here, everything is handmade, so it's only natural. If I wanted to gather all the repair tools, it would cost several silver coins just for that.

<b>

In that sense, space magic is convenient because it doesn't require those tools. Truly divine.

<b>

"Oh. By the way, where is the church?"

"Hmm? It's over there. It's a white-walled building, so you should be able to see it right away."

"Thanks."

<b>

Since I'm here, I decided to stop by the church to greet the god.

I also want to offer my tribute (socks).
