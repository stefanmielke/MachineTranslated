# It's great that the siblings get along well.

By the way, I thought I heard the voice of a god rather casually, and it turned out that there was a simple altar, or a god shelf, set up in this reception room.

When conducting transactions, it is often customary to swear an oath to the gods in addition to the contract magic, so it seems that a god shelf is standard equipment in the reception rooms of noble and merchant families.

<b>

...I guess there are many people who are unaware that the gods are peeking at them through this.

<b>

"I'll go change...!"

"I'll help you change, okay?"

"W-wait! Please don't come, big sister. I can change by myself!"

"Oh, don't say that. I want to talk about what’s coming next."

"Uu... "

<b>

Saying that, Dia-kun and Kumin-san headed to the next room to change.

With women's underwear, they'll definitely see it...! Good luck, Dia-kun!

<b>

<b>

"Ahh, Dia-kun's big sister is beautiful. I might fall for her."

"What’s up, Kari-chan? Are you perhaps averse to men?"

"It's not that I dislike them, but when it comes to forming a party, that's one thing, but keeping a smelly man around is a no-go."

"Oh, so that's why you had that kid dress as a girl."

<b>

Well, that's not entirely untrue. The main aim is to get the boy's socks, though.

<b>

"Hey, Kari-chan. Changing the subject, what's the reason the Alchemy Kingdom fell?"

"Well, it's actually a super trivial matter—"

'What? There’s nothing trivial about it, you know?'

"—but I can't understand the gods' thoughts, you know?"

<b>

God, please stop intercepting our small talk.

<b>

"I see. If I could understand the gods' thoughts, I could judge whether it's okay to carve out the ruins of the Alchemy Kingdom."

"That should be fine. Unless a new 'Chaos God' appears."

"Hmm?"

"If you're curious, why not pray to the gods at the church and ask? I don't know, though."

"Ah, that's true. I'll do that."

<b>

<b>

While chatting with Maria-baba, Dia-kun and Kumin-san returned.

Dia-kun's face was bright red, probably because his underwear was thoroughly checked when he changed.

...Even so, now that he's back to being a boy, he looks like a girl in boy's clothes. I guess it's because I've only seen him in girl’s clothes for so long.

<b>

"I think Dia-kun looks better in a dress."

"Is that so?"

"Is it okay to show off your thighs like that? They're white, dazzling, and cute, you know?"

"Hau."

<b>

Dia-kun fidgeted with his smooth white legs.

<b>

"...Hey, Dia-kun. You're not actually a girl, are you?"

"I'm not!"

<b>

Not, huh? He's so small, soft, and cute, though.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, I have the cargo we took back from the pirates. Where should I put it?"

"Eh? You're going to return the cargo?"

<b>

Kumin-san looked surprised by my suggestion.

<b>

"Of course I will! Originally, it belongs to you and Dia-kun, right?"

"Considering you already helped my brother, and now you're returning the cargo... what should I do to thank you? Oh, should I give you Dia? It seems you've taken quite a liking to him."

"Sister!?"

"Dia doesn't seem to mind, does he?"

"W-well, that's true, but..."

<b>

Dia-kun shyly fidgeted with his legs.

Hmm, those white thighs are dazzling.

<b>

<b>

"For now, if you want to thank me, please give me Kumin-san's socks."

"…Huh?"

<b>

Naturally, Kumin-san tilted her head. It seemed she heard me but didn't understand.

<b>

"Please give me the socks you're currently wearing. I'm collecting them for a reason."

"Now that you mention it, I did put Dia's socks somewhere earlier... then I'll arrange for a new pair of the same socks I'm wearing."

"That's not it! I need the socks you're wearing right now. It has to be the actual pair you just took off! Please, think of it as helping me!"

<b>

I bowed my head and earnestly pleaded.

<b>

"…Well, if you insist."

"Oh, here, take these as a replacement."

"You're well-prepared. Then I'll take them off... by the way, what are you going to do with the socks?"

"I guess I'll eat them. I don't know, though."

"Eat!?"

<b>

Kumin-san froze, her hands stopping as she was about to take off her socks.

<b>

"Eh, eat, huh? And it's not you, Karina-san, who's collecting them?"

<b>

Oh dear. Her cheeks are slightly flushed.

I see. The idea of someone unknown eating them is more embarrassing than just collecting them myself as a girl!

<b>

"…Well, my boss really loves socks."

"Boss!? Karina-san, um, what kind of person is your boss?"

"no comment!"

<b>

Even if he’s a pervert, knowing he’s a girl would lessen the embarrassment. I’ll keep it a secret.

Then, Kumin-san steeled herself and took off her socks. The way she neatly folded the socks showed her good upbringing. Very nice.

<b>

"…Here you go, Karina-san."

"Haha, thank you, princess! I will definitely deliver them!"

<b>

I knelt down and received the socks reverently, like a knight receiving a treasured sword.

<b>

"Uu, I think I understand a bit of how Dia felt earlier."

"I, on the other hand, understand a bit of how you felt earlier, big sister."

<b>

It's great that the siblings get along well. I put away the socks.
