# I'm glad you and your siblings are getting along so well.

Incidentally, when I thought I heard God's voice sounding rather light, I realized that a simple altar, or kamidana, had been set up in this reception room.

In conducting business transactions, people often swear an oath to the gods as a formality apart from contract magic, so it is said that a kamidana is standard equipment in the reception rooms of the homes of nobles and merchants.

<blank>

...... I'm sure many people are doing it without knowing that God is actually peeking in on them with it.

<blank>

I'm going to go change and go to ......."

I'll go help you get dressed.

Wait, wait!　Don't come here, sister. I can change by myself.

I said, "Oh, no, don't say that. I want to talk about the future."

Ugh. ......"

<blank>

With that, Mr. Dear and Ms. Kumin headed to the next room to change.

My underwear is women's, I'll be seen with my guts. ......　Good luck, Dear!

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sure I'm going to fall in love with her. I think I'm going to fall in love with her."

What is it, Kari, are you a man-hater?"

It's not that I don't like them, but I don't want them in my party, but I don't want them on my side because they smell like men.

'Oh, so that's why you had that girl dressed as a woman.

<blank>

Well, it's not without its own. Mainly, though, I'm aiming for the socks of men's girls.

<blank>

What is the reason why the alchemy kingdom was destroyed? I'm going to change the subject, but what was the reason why the alchemy kingdom was destroyed?"

"Oh, no, it's just that it's super stupid--"

What about?　There's nothing vulgar about it?"

I don't know what God is thinking.

<blank>

God, please stop intercepting the chit-chat.

<blank>

I see. If I knew what God was thinking, I would be able to decide whether or not it would be okay to cut off the site of the alchemy kingdom."

That should be fine. Unless there's a new 'chaos god' out there."

Hmm?"

I don't know," he said. "If it bothers you, why don't you go to church and pray to God and ask him?　I don't know."

'Oh, yes, I will. I will."

<blank>

While I was chatting with Grandma Maria, Mr. Dear and Ms. Kumin returned.

Dia's face is bright red because she must have checked her underwear perfectly when she changed.

Even though I'm back to being a boy at ......, it no longer looks like a girl dressed as a man. I guess it's because I've been seeing her dressed as a woman for so long.

<blank>

I still think Dear would look better in a dress.

Is that so?"

'Are you sure you want to bare your thighs all the way?　They're so white and dazzling and pretty, aren't they?"

"Huh."

<blank>

Deere-kun wriggles his smooth white legs.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's actually a girl after all. I wonder if you're actually a girl after all?"

No!

<blank>

I wonder if I won't. It's so small and pudgy and cute.

<blank>

<blank>

I said, "Yes, I know. This is the package we took back from the pirates, where shall we put it?"

What?　Can I have my shipment back?"

<blank>

Mr. Kumin looks surprised at my suggestion.

<blank>

"Of course we'll give it back.　It originally belonged to Mr. Kumin and Mr. Deer.

"How can I thank you ...... if you are willing to help my brother even for free and then return the cargo to me? I'd like to give you Dee.　He seems to have taken very good care of you.

Sister?

Dee's not too happy about it, is she?"

Well, that's true, but ......

<blank>

Deer-kun is shy, with his legs squirming inwardly.

Hmmm, those white thighs are dazzling.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, if you want to thank me, please give me Mr. Kumin's socks."

"...... yes?"

<blank>

Naturally, Mr. Kumin tilted his head. This is like he heard it but didn't understand it.

<blank>

I want the socks you are wearing right now, Mr. Kumin. I'm collecting socks for a reason."

I see that you also put Dee's socks away somewhere earlier. ...... can arrange for a new pair of socks identical to the ones I'm wearing."

No, sir!　The socks that Mr. Kumin is wearing right now. It's meaningless unless it's that actual sock that you just took off!　Please think of it as helping me, one way or another!"

<blank>

I bowed my head and asked in all sincerity.

<blank>

...... Well, that's fine."

Oh, here's a replacement sock for you.

'Well prepared. Now let's take them off. ...... By the way, what are we going to do with the socks we collected?"

I think they eat it. I don't know."

Eat!

<blank>

Mr. Kumin's hand stops when he is about to take off his socks.

<blank>

"What, tabe, eh?　And not the ones that Karina-san collects?"

<blank>

Oops. Your cheeks are slightly red, sister.

I see. It's more embarrassing for me, as a homosexual, to be eaten by someone I don't know, or some other unexplainable situation, than to just collect them!

<blank>

...... yeah, my boss loves socks."

Boss!　Mr. Karina, what kind of person is your, uh, boss?"

No comment!"

<blank>

Even a pervert would probably feel half as much shame if he knew it was a girl. Let's keep it a secret.

Kumin-san took off his socks with determination. He carefully folded his socks after taking them off. Good, good, good.

<blank>

"...... please, Karina."

Hahaha, thank you, Princess!　I will definitely deliver it to you!"

<blank>

Like a knight receiving a treasured sword, he kneels down and reverently accepts the socks.

<blank>

Ugh, now I understand a little better how Dee felt earlier."

I, on the other hand, understood a little how my sister felt earlier.

<blank>

I'm glad you and your siblings are getting along so well. I put away my socks.

<blank>
