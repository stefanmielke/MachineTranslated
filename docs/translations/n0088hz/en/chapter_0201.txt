# Thus, Deere won the tamer competition.

<blank>

<blank>

Deere's second game.

Arthur's opponent did not abstain this time and his opponent challenged him, but Arthur's lightning-fast first attack first took down half of his three opponents.

The remaining three attacked immediately - but they were easily evaded. Yes, the Thunder Dragon is fast, isn't it?

The team won quickly with a slap on the tail to eliminate all three of them.

<blank>

In the third game that followed, this time the enemy targeted Dia-kun, but Arthur intervened and was attacked. However, since the attack did not penetrate the dragon's scales, he was practically unharmed.

Then, with a light "Hoo! and by blowing a lightning-attribute breath, the dexterous technique of flying the breath as a ball was reversed and hit the opponent's tamer for the victory.

Your squire over there didn't protect his master, I'm sorry to hear that.

<blank>

<blank>

Strong!　Too strong!　This is the dragon!　This is the Dragon Priestess!"

<blank>

Deere is praised as the winner and waves from the stage.

A dragon priestess...that might be the perfect name for you right now, Dia. Oh, I'd be happy to dress him up in a miko outfit.

<blank>

<blank>

Will the next final be an easy win?

I hope you will win, because a total of four gold coins are at stake: my (excluding healer funds), Masilo's entire fortune, and Dia's and Isia's pocket money.

<blank>

And then Arthur, who has returned to his base, comes poking out of his backpack.

It is a small mode, so if you hide its wings, it is just like an iguana.

<blank>

I was losing confidence after I was beaten up by Miss!　I lost my confidence when I was beaten up by Miss Tamer, but she is really strong, isn't she?

Well, it's stronger than a bad monster. It's a dragon."

But what kind of creature is Miss Hagan's stronger?

<blank>

Ask God about that. I myself think I'm a human being.

<blank>

In the finals, I plan to wear the armor made by the Five Elders and have Dia-chan become a dragon rider!

'I wonder if that's a tamer too, just in case. I'm going to check with Mr. Deere to make sure it doesn't go out under ...... convention rules."

Yes."

<blank>

And Arthur pulled his head back and returned to his base.

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, yes. That ball that Arthur is in and out of is named the Demon Ball, but it is a Haribo made by the Five Great Old Men's Workshop. Its only function is to 'emit a red ray of light and envelop the object.

In fact, I'm in the audience, and I'm a little bit in and a little bit out of the base.

<blank>

It is definitely not a monstrous ball, but a monster ball.

I considered operating in the direction of casting a spell with a poof or put in and put out, but it was easier to see from a distance to wrap it in light. There's also the possibility that they won't hear it if it's a voice.

<blank>

I mean, what's with that clinging light? What are the laws of physics?

The Five Elders' magical tool technology, fear not. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, it's a quick and easy final.

<blank>

Come on!　Finally, the finals!　First, in the red corner, Shepherd Shepherd!　The demons in hand are six rampaging sheep, Mud Sheep!　The favorite in this tournament!"

<blank>

His opponent, a dog-beastman, is a talented fighter who made it to the finals with an assault strategy of running over his opponents while standing on their backs with six ferocious sheep-shaped demons in tow.

He is an acrobatic player who uses whips and magic on top of sheep to guide them while still attacking them.

<blank>

The dark horse of the tournament!　Blue Corner, Dia!　There is only one demon, the Thunder Dragon, who bears the name of a hero!　It's the real thing that has won this far! --Ooh, here's the dragon wearing armor!　And it's got a seat on its back!　This can't be right!

<blank>

As the MC had said, and as Arthur had declared in advance, Arthur was wearing armor with a seat. He then snatched up Dear by the tail and placed her on his back.

<blank>

What a surprise!　Dear player, dragon ride!　How dare the proud dragon ride a person on her own back!　No doubt, she is the legendary princess!　The Dragon Priestess!

<blank>

In addition, there is no problem in terms of the rules with riding a follower.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, are you ready to be overrun?"

You're telling me, princess!"

<blank>

Both glared at each other--"Fyah! and with a shout from the MC, Arthur flew up into the air.

<blank>

It's a game. Come on Arthur, it's a brace. Go to ...... and go easy on him."

Gühr!

<blank>

The final - but it was a one-sided battle.

Shepherd attempted to attack the flying dragon with magic and long-range whips, but he was too quick to hit it.

<blank>

With Dear and Arthur in control of the air, Shepherd was helpless.

As previously declared, they were unilaterally overrun.

<blank>

'Damn, damn!　You're a coward!　Come down and fightooooo!"

I'm sorry. But this is the way dragons are supposed to fight."

<blank>

If you have a problem with it, you should go and tame a dragon, too. That was the story.

It is the tamer's ability to follow strong demons and take advantage of their unique fighting style.

<blank>

"Gee whiz!"

<blank>

Reality is not equal like a game. It would be strange if a sheep crawling on the ground and a flying dragon could fight more than evenly.

<blank>

<blank>

'This is terrible!　What a one-sided game!　But this is the Dragon!　This is the Dragon!　It just showed its true colors, what's wrong with it!　Yes, nothing bad! --The winner, Dia!

<blank>

The victory was a display of Dragon's overwhelming power. It was an overly one-sided final.

The audience gave a rousing round of applause to this very rare dragon and dragon rider.

<blank>

Thus, Deere won the tamer competition.
