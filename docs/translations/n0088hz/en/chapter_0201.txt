# Thus, Dia-kun won the Tamer Tournament.

<b>

<b>

Dia-kun's second match.

This time, the opponent faced Arthur without forfeiting, but three of his monsters went down immediately due to Arthur's lightning-fast preemptive attack.

The remaining three attacked right away, but――were easily dodged. That's right, Thunder Dragon is quick.

Then, with a swift tail slap, he took out all three and won effortlessly.

<b>

In the following third match, the enemy targeted Dia-kun, but Arthur intervened and took the attack. However, it wasn't an attack strong enough to penetrate dragon scales, so he was practically unscathed.

After that, with a light "Hah!" he blew a breath of lightning attribute, skillfully sending it as a projectile towards the opponent's tamer and securing victory.

The opponent's familiar didn't protect its master, what a shame.

<b>

<b>

"Strong! Too strong! This is a dragon!! This is the Dragon Priestess!!"

<b>

Praised as the winner, Dia-kun waved from the stage.

The title of Dragon Priestess might be a perfect fit for Dia-kun now. Oh, it would be nice to dress him in a priestess outfit.

<b>

<b>

Will the next final match be an easy win too?

With all my (excluding healer funds) and Mashiro-san's total wealth, along with Dia-kun and Aisia's pocket money, a total of four gold coins is at stake, so I really want Dia-kun to win.

<b>

Just then, Arthur popped his head out of the backpack upon returning to the base.

In small mode, if he hides his wings, he just looks like an iguana.

<b>

'Wow, the Tamer Tournament is so much fun! I lost my confidence after being beaten up by the sister, but she's really strong, right!?'

"Well, stronger than a mediocre monster, since it's a dragon."

'But the sister is stronger, what kind of creature is she?'

<b>

Ask the god about that. I consider myself human.

<b>

'In the finals, I'm planning to wear the armor made by the Five Elders and have Dia-kun become a Dragon Rider!'

"Is that okay for a tamer? Make sure to confirm with Dia-kun that it doesn't violate tournament rules."

'Okay!'

<b>

With that, Arthur pulled his head back and returned to the base.

<b>

<b>

By the way, that orb that Arthur goes in and out of is called a monster orb, but it's a hollow model made by the Five Elders' workshop. Its function is simply to "emit a red beam and envelop the target."

In reality, I, sitting in the audience, am the one who is putting it in and taking it out.

<b>

It is definitely not a monster ball, but a monster orb.

I considered using spells to make it appear or disappear, but wrapping it in light was easier to see from a distance. There’s also the possibility that voices might not be heard.

<b>

What is that swirling light anyway? What are the physical laws doing?

The magical tool technology of the Five Elders is truly fearsome...!

<b>

<b>

<b>

And so, the final match begins effortlessly.

<b>

"Alright! It's finally the final match! First, in the red corner, Shepherd, the shepherd tamer! His monsters are six rampaging sheep, the Mad Sheep!! The most popular in this tournament!"

<b>

The opponent, a dog beastman, has six ferocious sheep-type monsters and has made it to the finals using a charge tactic, trampling enemies while standing on his sheep.

Using whips and magic from atop the sheep, he attacks while guiding them, making him an acrobatic competitor.

<b>

"Facing him is this tournament's dark horse! In the blue corner, Dia! The monster is just one, the Thunder Dragon, bearing the name of a hero!! The real deal that has made it this far!!――Oh, wait! The dragon is wearing armor! And there's a seat on its back!? Could it be!!"

<b>

As the announcer said, and as Arthur had previously declared, Arthur was indeed wearing armor with a seat. He then gently lifted Dia-kun with his tail and placed him on his back.

<b>

"W-w-wait!! Dia is riding the dragonーーーーッ!? A proud dragon carries a person on its back!! No doubt, she is the legendary princess! The Dragon Priestess!!"

<b>

Moreover, riding on a familiar is not against the rules.

<b>

<b>

"Now, are you ready to be trampled?"

"Y-you're quite the princess, aren't you!?"

<b>

The two glared at each other――with the announcer's call of "Fight!" Arthur soared into the sky.

<b>

"The match is decided. Now, Arthur, breathe. ...Please go easy on them."

'Gyaaaah!'

<b>

The final match――however, it was a one-sided battle.

Against the dragon flying in the sky, Shepherd attempted to attack with magic and long-range whips, but they couldn't hit due to its speed, and instead, lightning attribute breath projectiles rained down on the ground.

<b>

With Dia-kun and Arthur having air superiority, Shepherd was left with no options.

As previously declared, he was being trampled unilaterally.

<b>

"Y-you coward! Come down and fightーーー!!"

"I'm sorry. But this is the dragon's natural fighting style."

<b>

If you have complaints, go tame a dragon yourself. That's how it was.

Having strong monsters and utilizing their unique fighting styles is the skill of a tamer.

<b>

'Gyaooon!'

<b>

Reality isn't as equal as a game. It's strange for ground-dwelling sheep and flying dragons to be able to fight on equal terms.

<b>

<b>

"This is terrible! What a one-sided game!! But this is a dragon! This is what a dragon is!! It’s just showing its true power, what’s wrong with that!? That's right, nothing is wrong!!――Winner, Dia!!"

<b>

With the overwhelming power of the dragon on display, the victory was secured. The final match was too one-sided.

The audience gave a grand applause for the very rare dragon, and the Dragon Rider.

<b>

Thus, Dia-kun won the Tamer Tournament.
