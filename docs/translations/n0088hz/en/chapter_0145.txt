# Kind-hearted angel, perhaps?

<b>

The border of the Dwarf Kingdom was a sturdy stone fortress visible from a distance.

Is it similar to the Great Wall of China? However, it is said to be made of a single piece of stone.

<b>

"How about this large, well-formed monolith? It's one of the famous sights in the Dwarf Kingdom."

"Oh, it's certainly impressive that it's this big without being made of concrete."

"It is said that the first king of the former country created it with magic."

<b>

I see, there is magic in this world. So maybe it wasn't that difficult after all?

It must be challenging enough to be remembered as a legend, though.

<b>

So, we arrived at the border in a magical tool vehicle.

At the entrance of the border, there are carriages lined up. …Are they waiting in line? It’s really long.

<b>

"Looks like we're being stared at, huh, Dia-kun…"

"Well, it's a horse-drawn carriage without horses. It's definitely unusual."

<b>

Dia-kun, who is involved in its creation, looks proud.

Then, Aishia leans out of the window to see what's happening ahead.

<b>

"Master, this line might take quite a while."

"Hm, why's that?"

"There's a merchant setting up a tent up ahead. The inspection might be halted."

"Ugh, seriously?"

<b>

If that's the case, it means we can't simply wait to enter the Dwarf Kingdom.

In our case, we can insist that we are inside the vehicle and lounge around in the storage space, so we can wait as long as we want, but I really don't want to wait aimlessly.

<b>

"What could have caused this situation?"

"I don't know. Should I go ask?"

"Speaking of gathering information, it's the bards, right? …Can you do it?"

"Yes! Leave it to me!"

<b>

Saying that, Aishia took a xylophone, got out of the vehicle, and walked toward the front of the line.

And it seems she is already exchanging information.

<b>

"With a strong instrument, a bard has high communication skills… Aishia is impressive."

"A bard can't exist without communication. Should I do some maintenance on the vehicle?"

"It's not operating since it's being moved with spatial magic, so I think it’s fine?"

"I've thought of an operating mechanism, so I'm preparing to incorporate it!"

<b>

Having learned from the mechanisms of golems, Dia-kun immediately starts tinkering with the engine part.

Dia-kun really loves making magical tools like these machines. I like them too.

<b>

But it really isn't moving… Feeling a bit idle, I read an alchemy textbook on medicine to pass the time.

Time passes leisurely, and Aishia returns.

<b>

"Welcome back! Did you find out anything?"

"It seems that a dangerous magical beast has appeared in the country. They say we are waiting in line for entry inspection until safety is secured. …However, it seems we can pass at our own risk. What do you want to do?"

"Oh, what kind of magical beast?"

"They say it's a Thunder Dragon."

<b>

Oh. A dragon… a dragon!

That's quite romantic! And Thunder, electricity, huh!

<b>

"Aishia, do you know how long it might take to secure safety if we leave it as is?"

"Apparently, the national army will be dispatched, so… hmm, it might take about a week until subjugation?"

<b>

If it's about that long, it might be okay to lounge around a bit longer. If we don't want to stand out, we should do that.

<b>

"…Can you hunt it, big sister?"

"Hm? I think I could manage, but why do you ask?"

"Even if it's a Dwarf army, there might be casualties against a dragon. If possible, I thought it would be better if you handled it to avoid any casualties…"

"I see."

<b>

Oh, Dia-kun is so cute. Worrying about unknown Dwarves…!

<b>

"Kind-hearted angel, perhaps?"

"N-no, that's not it. If there are lives I can save, I would want to help as much as I can, right?"

"Especially if you have the means and the leisure to do so."

"You are truly kind, Dia-sama. It's so dazzling that I can't look directly at you."

<b>

Aishia covers her eyes with both hands. I understand.

No, I don't think that people should just die unnecessarily either.

<b>

"Alright, I'll do it for you. For Dia-kun."

"Thank you, big sister!"

"I also thank you, Master. Please help your Dwarven brethren."

<b>

Seeing Dia-kun looking happy warms my heart along with Aishia.

Then, I suddenly thought.

<b>

"Hey, since I'm granting Dia-kun's request, I want something as a reward from you, Dia-kun?"

"A reward, you say? Yes, I'll do anything I can!"

<b>

Huh? Did you just say anything?

Hehe, maybe I should think of a slightly naughty request. Like letting me suck on your ears.

<b>

"…Ah. Do dragons ever transform into humans?"

"I've heard of dragon-type beastmen, but dragons transforming is just a fairy tale."

<b>

Even in a fantasy, there are fairy tales. I thought that was just between us.
