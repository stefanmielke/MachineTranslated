# Are you a kind-hearted angel?

The borders of the Dwarven lands were stone fortresses so chunky that they could be seen from a distance.

Is it similar to the Great Wall of China?　However, I heard that the wall is a single piece of stone.

<blank>

'How do you like it, this large, well-prepared monolith is one of the most famous sights in Dwarf country.

'Ooh, it sure is amazing how big it is when it's not concrete.'

It is said to have been magically created by the first late king."

<blank>

Okay, so there is magic in this world. So it's not so hard, then?

I guess it's difficult enough to be left as an anecdote.

<blank>

So we came to the border in our magic car.

Carriages are lined up at the entrance to the border. ...... Is this waiting for a turn?　It's so long.

<blank>

"You're getting some stares, Deere. ......

'It's a horse-drawn carriage without a horse. It's definitely a rarity."

<blank>

Dia, who is involved in the creation process, is very proud of his work.

And Isiah leans out the window to see what's ahead.

<blank>

I am sorry, but I am not sure how long it will take to get in line. This queue may take quite a while."

Hmm, why?"

'There's a merchant tented out front. Maybe the vetting process is suspended."

"Ugh, seriously?"

<blank>

Wouldn't that mean that you can't simply wait and enter the land of the dwarves?

In our case, we can wait as long as we want because we can rummage around in the base of the storage space while insisting on being in the car, but we don't want to wait without a guess.

<blank>

Why is this happening?"

I don't know. Shall I go ask him?"

I'm a bard when it comes to gathering information, right? Can you ask ......?"

Yes!　Leave it to me!"

<blank>

With that said, Isiah got out of the car, iron harp in hand, and walked toward the front of the procession.

And they appear to be exchanging information as soon as possible.

<blank>

The demon has the gold bar, the bard has the musical instrument ......, and she's a very good communicator, isn't she?"

I'm sure you can't be a bard if you can't communicate." Shall I maintain my car too?"

'It's running on space magic, it's not operational, and I think it'll be fine, right?'

We've come up with an operating mechanism and we're prepping it for integration!"

<blank>

Dia immediately starts tinkering with the engine part, saying, "I studied it by looking at the mechanism of the Golem.

Dia, you really like making these machines and other magical tools, don't you? I like it too.

<blank>

But it really doesn't work. ...... I'm bored out of my mind, so I pass the time by reading my own medicine-based alchemy instruction book.

Time passes leisurely, and Isiah returns.

<blank>

Welcome back. What did you find out?"

I heard that some kind of dangerous monster has appeared in the country. I heard that the people standing in line here are waiting for their turn to go through immigration after it is safe to do so. ......It seems that you can go through at your own risk, but.... What should we do?"

"Oh, what kind of demon?"

They say it's the Thunder Dragon."

<blank>

Hou. Dragons. ...... dragons!

That's romantic, isn't it?　And thunder, electricity...!

<blank>

Ms. Isiah, do you have any idea how long it will take to get to safety if we leave it at this point?"

"In the meantime, I heard that the national army is leaving, so ...... hmmm, maybe a week or so to defeat them?"

<blank>

You might as well just slog around with the addition for that much. If you don't want to stand out, you should.

<blank>

Would ...... sister be able to hunt?"

"Hmm?　I think I can afford it, why?"

The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you want to do and how you want to do it. If possible, it would be better if your sister handled it so that there would be no casualties. ......

I see.

<blank>

Yikes, Deere, you are so cute. I can't believe you're worried about a strange dwarf. ......

<blank>

A kind-hearted angel, perhaps?"

No, that's not true. If you have a life to save, you want to save it as much as possible, don't you?"

Especially if you have the means and can afford it."

Dear Dear, you are really very kind. It's too bright for me to look directly at you."

<blank>

Aisia covers her eyes with both hands. I understand.

No, yeah, I don't think people should die for nothing or anything either.

<blank>

I'll do it for you. For you, Dear."

"!　Thank you, sister!"

I thank you, too, my dear brother. Please help our Dwarf brethren."

<blank>

Me and Isiah are relieved to see a happy Dia-kun.

It occurred to me.

<blank>

Hey, since I'm going to do you a favor, would you like a treat from Deere?"

A reward?　Yes, anything I can do to help.

<blank>

Hmm?　Did you just say "anything"?

Heh heh, maybe I'll think of some kind of a request. Maybe I'll ask you to suck my ear.

<blank>

"...... Ah. Do dragons ever humanize?"

I've heard of dragon beastmen, but dragons transforming themselves is a fairy tale."

<blank>

It's a fantasy and there are fairy tales and such. I thought, "Between you and me.

<blank>
