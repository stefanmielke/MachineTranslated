# And a few days later.

And a few days later.

<blank>

So that's what these guys have.

Whoa. Thanks."

<blank>

The mercenaries came to the demon tribe's village with grim faces and handed me my reward.

The carriage and its contents. He gave me the inventory. Well, that's very thoughtful.

<blank>

...... light, scary as hell."

Hmm?"　Did you want more threats?"

Give me a break, I've been threatened enough."

<blank>

The mercenary shrugs his shoulders as he says so.

<blank>

Gold, silver, treasures, glittering jewelry, cut gems, and all sorts of other things. I receive the inventory and look it over.

<blank>

The inventory also includes what appear to be items from the store, as it is likely that they were not all immediately converted to treasure.

Wow, they mainly dealt in medicines. They have magic potions, ointments, poultices, and bandages. I'll take this one.

<blank>

<blank>

And Galdra poked his head in.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a sparkling stone or not, but it's a sparkling stone.　Which one?"

I'll put the jewelry in the carriage over there. I'll decorate them for you later.

I'm like, 'Yay!　Karina is my best friend!　She's strong, cute, fashionable and awesome!"

<blank>

Hehe, don't give me such a compliment. I can't talk to dragons, and you're smiling at me.

<blank>

Galdra pulls a box of jewels out of the carriage in his mouth.

He then dexterously opened the lid with his fingernail and looked at the jewelry lined up inside the box.

<blank>

I like this one!　I like this one, the yellow color is beautiful!　It's tiny, but it's bigger than the others, can I have it?"

Oh?　You want some?　Bring what you want, it's mostly a tribute, or rather compensation, to the dragon."

I'm going to go to the store and buy a new one!　Decorate it like you're going to decorate it later!"

<blank>

And Galdra walked away, carefully holding a jewel the size of a beetle in his hand.

<blank>

How can you tame a dragon like a dog,...... or rather, how can you build a house on the edge of the Imperial City with just that one jewel?"

It's just a 'pretty stone' to the dragon, Mr. Mercenary. Well, it's worth at least a souvenir to her. The other one doesn't seem too interested."

Yes, or ......, or was it a bitch, that thing."

<blank>

The gender of the dragons, well, normal people can't tell by looking at them. Galdra, I'm sure I'm a girl when I say and do things right. ......

Do you think if we dress them up more, they will be recognized as females by humans?

<blank>

And who are these slaves over here?"

I have her over there, but she's a demoness.

"Oh, just give it back to the village. The dragon said he didn't want it either.

'Well, I've been dreading the thought of being ...... dragon bait, so let's get on with it and tell them.'

<blank>

Well, that's certainly scary.

<blank>

"...... So what are we going to do about these merchants?　Can we let them go now?"

Hmm?"

<blank>

and apart from the inventory, there are merchants with their arms tied behind their backs.

All the jewelry had been stripped away, and the figure was crude and without a pattern.

<blank>

Oh, yeah. Okay."

<blank>

When I say this, the two merchants look relieved.

...I think I'll nail it.

<blank>

However, the dragon-sama told me not to get involved with the Oni village anymore, the priestess said."

<blank>

Then, he threatens the merchants, applying pressure (physical) with some spatial magic.

<blank>

'Keep your mouth shut. He also said that if someone comes to attack the demon tribe's village or the dragon, your lives are not guaranteed. ...... Oh, Princess. She said the dragon told her."

Hic ...... is hi ......!"

I know, I know, I know. ......!

<blank>

Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling a lot of pressure that I don't understand and I'm scared. That's very good, sir.

<blank>

I thought about having them hide the village of the demon tribe, but they don't have that kind of money anymore. I'll forgive them just for keeping their mouths shut.

<blank>

Ah. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

<blank>

"So, mercenaries. You guys know ...... if you want to spare your lives, right?"

"Oh, oh,...... we will never talk about this village either. But the dragons themselves are so big that if they are seen from the Imperial City, they will know, won't they?"

I'd appreciate it if you could put out as many rumors and such as you can. Okay?"

"...... ow."

<blank>

The mercenary nods disapprovingly. Well, bemoan the luck of you guys who happened to attack me when I was playing with you.

<blank>

If you had a scratch on Mr. Deere, it wouldn't have been this bad, so I hope you're happy there.

...... Oh, you want to stroke Misha's butt?　I'll allow you to do it just once.
