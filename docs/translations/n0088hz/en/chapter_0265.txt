# And a few days later.

And a few days later.

<b>

"Well then, this is their property."

"Oh. Thank you."

<b>

The mercenaries arrived at the demon tribe's village with stern faces and handed me my reward.

A carriage and its contents. They gave me the inventory. Wow, how considerate.

<b>

"…It's light, almost frighteningly so."

"Huh? Did you want me to threaten you more?"

"Give me a break, I've been threatened enough."

<b>

The mercenary shrugged as he said that.

<b>

Gold and silver treasures, sparkling jewels, cut gemstones, and various other items. I received the inventory and glanced through it.

<b>

They probably couldn't turn everything into treasure right away, as there were items that seemed to be shop goods listed in the inventory.

Oh, they mainly dealt in potions, huh? It looks like there are magical potions, ointments, compresses, and band-aids. I might as well take these.

<b>

<b>

Just then, Galudora poked her head in.

<b>

"Oh, did shiny stones come in? Let me see!"

"Whoa, Galudora, the jewels are in that carriage over there. I'll decorate them for you later."

"Yay! Karina is seriously my best friend! Strong, cute, stylish, and the best, right?"

<b>

Hehe, don't flatter me too much. I'm supposed to be unable to converse with dragons, and it's making me grin.

<b>

Galudora pulled out a box filled with jewels from inside the carriage.

Then she skillfully opened the lid with her claws and admired the jewelry lined up inside.

<b>

"Oh! This one's nice, the yellow is pretty! It's small, but bigger than the others, can I take this one?"

"Huh? You want it? Take whatever you like—most of this is a tribute to dragons, or rather, compensation."

"Yay! Please decorate it for me later!"

<b>

With that, Galudora carefully held a gemstone the size of a rhinoceros beetle and walked away.

<b>

"To tame a dragon like a dog... I mean, with just that one gemstone, you could build a house on the outskirts of the imperial capital, right?"

"For dragons, it's just a 'pretty stone,' mercenary. Well, it has some value as a souvenir for her. The other one doesn't seem too interested, though."

"Is that so... Wait, was that one a female?"

<b>

Most people wouldn't be able to tell a dragon's gender at a glance. Galudora certainly acts like a girl, though...

If she dressed up more, would humans start recognizing her as female?

<b>

"So, what about this slave over here?"

"I've brought her over there, but she's a demon tribe woman."

"Ah, return her to the village. The dragon said she doesn't need her, apparently?"

"I see... She was terrified thinking she would become dragon food, so I should let her know quickly."

<b>

That would indeed be scary.

<b>

"So, what about these merchants? Can we release them now?"

"Huh?"

<b>

There were merchants with their arms tied behind their backs, separate from the inventory.

They had been stripped of all their jewelry and looked shabby.

<b>

"Ah, yeah. It's fine."

<b>

When I said that, the two merchants looked relieved.

...Should I give them a warning?

<b>

"However, the dragon said not to get involved with the demon tribe village anymore, as the priestess said."

<b>

Then I applied some pressure (physical) on the merchants with spatial magic while threatening them.

<b>

"Keep your mouths shut. If anyone comes to attack the demon tribe village or the dragon, your lives won't be guaranteed... Oh, the princess said that. The dragon said it."

"Y-Yes...!"

"I u-understand...!?"

<b>

Yeah, they're feeling the incomprehensible pressure and are scared. That's very good.

<b>

I briefly thought about making them hide the demon tribe village, but they don't have the financial power for that anymore. I'll just let them off with a warning to keep quiet.

<b>

Oh. Wait a minute?

<b>

"So, mercenaries. If you value your lives... you understand, right?"

"Y-Yeah... We definitely won't talk about this village. But, the dragon is so big that if it's seen from the imperial capital, it'll be discovered, right?"

"Please help put out any rumors as much as you can. Is that okay?"

"…Sure."

<b>

The mercenaries nodded reluctantly. Well, lament your bad luck for attacking while I was visiting.

<b>

If anything happened to Dia-kun, it wouldn't have ended at this level, so I hope they appreciate that.

...Oh, should I give Misha a pat on the back? I'll allow it just this once.
