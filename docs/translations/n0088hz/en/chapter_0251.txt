Leaving Deer in Arthur's care while protecting him with wards, I came alone to the mountain for a preliminary inspection.

<blank>

Olaa!　Come out, you little dragon!　Come on out and beat them up!

<blank>

I look for the dragon while punching down trees in the mountains as I see fit.

The broken wood will be collected and turned into lumber. It is an important resource, and we must use it without wasting it!

<blank>

"Hey, hey, hey, isn't this where you belong?　Hey, dragon!

<blank>

A wild boar was running away and I have to catch it. I think I'll have peony stew for lunch today.

Close the fish quickly and spread the blood to attract prey.

<blank>

Here's the meat. Come on out, dragon!"

<blank>

And then a wolf, not a dragon, came up to me. I wonder if he has a better nose than the dragon, the dog. Well, I don't mind dogs, so I'll let it slide. Shush. At least go call a dragon.

<blank>

I kicked the biggest wolf that attacked me. I kicked it as hard as I could and the pack ran away.

<blank>

Hah, I don't think it's coming out, Dragon."

<blank>

...... Hmmm...so much rampant, but they don't show their faces at all.

<blank>

"Ei, space magic search!"

<blank>

Explore a radius of about 1km. ...... Hmmm, a few men of the demon tribe. A few dozen beasts there. Ignore the small animals and insects.

The guy from the demon tribe seems to be running away from something. Oh, because I was out of control here?

<blank>

Let's go a little further into the mountains."

<blank>

Move deeper into the mountains using spatial magic transference. Search again ...... Ah. It's an orc. They make good meat, don't they? The higher level ones are not so good, though. Let's hunt it.

<blank>

Hello and goodbye!"

<blank>

Without a shred of hesitation, he just went for it!　and reap the surroundings, hunting the orcs. He sends its head flying, grabs it by the legs and swings it around, centrifugally draining its blood. At the same time, the blood is scattered and calls the beast to it. ...... is the wolf you just saw. It ran away when it saw me. He looked at me and said, "Why are you running ahead of me?" He had this look on his face.

And by the way, the men of the demon tribe were passing us, so these guys ran off to the side too.

<blank>



<blank>

Ah. The voice of a dragon. I looked up to see a black scaled dragon flapping its wings and watching me from the sky. It looks like it's coming.

<blank>

What are you doing in my territory?

"Hey, I've been looking for you, Mr. Dragon. Is it true you said you wanted a sacrifice?"

'What about?　Oh, is that what the demons near here said? ......, a ningen is speaking the language of dragons!　What the hell is going on!

<blank>

The dragon looks startled.

<blank>

What the hell, even dragons understand human language, so it wouldn't be surprising if humans could speak dragon language."

I'm sure that's true, too. Then again, you!　Don't you dare trespass on my territory!

<blank>

For a moment I thought he had calmed down, but then he attacked me in the usual way.

<blank>

OLAUGH!"

Hebuuuuuuuuuu!"

<blank>

Yes, I've been quiet with a single slap on the side of my face. Now, let's talk again. Mr. Dragon?
