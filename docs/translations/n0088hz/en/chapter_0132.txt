I changed the bathwater. Phew, I got lightheaded from soaking too long...

<b>

"Hey, sorry about that. I got too excited in the bath and went a bit overboard."

"Ugh, this beast... I like it."

"Hahaha. But you didn't resist, did you, Karina?"

<b>

I certainly didn't, but... without any enhancements, I'm so weak, and conversely, Mashiro-san is really strong, and, uh, yeah. It was just amazing.

<b>

Mashiro-san, drying her hair with magic and brushing it, looks happy.

Mashiro-san looking damp is nice, but fluffy is also really good. I like it.

<b>

"Still, even if it's just for the duration of the request, having unlimited access to the bath is nice."

"Huh? You can use it even after the request is over, you know?"

<b>

When I said that, Mashiro-san tilted her head slightly with her mouth open.

<b>

"What are you talking about? I'm an adventurer from Calcutta. I'm not planning to leave town yet, you know? Or are you planning to live in this town too? It's quite convenient, and you're welcome to stay at my place."

"Um, well then, I'll make a door that connects to Mashiro-san's house here. You can come and go anytime."

"Huh?"

<b>

Mashiro-san's eyes widen in surprise. Wait, didn't I mention that?

<b>

"Wait, wait. This is, like, inside the backpack, right?"

"Huh? That's not it. The backpack is just connected here... So, yeah, you could walk a few steps from the back of the dungeon to Mashiro-san's house via here. In fact, if I were in another town, it would still just be a few steps to get there."

"...Seriously? I may not be smart, but I can tell that's insane."

<b>

That's right. It can be misused in various ways.

<b>

"So, I'll put some restrictions on your activities here, but please understand."

"O-okay. Well, if I can take a bath anytime, I have no complaints."

<b>

You really love baths, huh...

Oh, by the way, the water I changed was filled with Mashiro-san's body hair, so it's no wonder that it's often disliked at bathhouses. The drain will get clogged.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Okay, this is Mashiro-san's room. There's no furniture, but here's the key."

"Alright! It's next to the bath!"

<b>

After creating the room and handing over the key, Mashiro-san smiled so happily that it was obvious even with her dog-like face.

Once the request is over, I'll create a direct path to Mashiro-san's house inside this room.

<b>

"Still, it's spacious. This is even bigger than my place; the guild could fit in here."

"You were the one who requested it to be spacious, Mashiro-san."

"It’s good for exercising, right? It's kind of strange how it's dark like a dungeon but bright and easy to see."

<b>

The space is like a gymnasium. It seems like you could play basketball or volleyball if you had the equipment and members.

<b>

"Alright, Karina, shall we have a mock battle right away? No magic for you. I'll go barehanded too."

"Isn't that a bit harsh for a magic user like me?"

"Can't be helped, you can use physical enhancement."

<b>

Hah, foolish. If I'm in an invincible state, I won't lose!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

...There was a time when I thought that.

<b>

"Don't just punch me in the face because it doesn't hurt!? It's scary, scary, scary!!"

"Hey! Don't close your eyes, that's not training! Endure it! If you don't like it, kick me away and create some distance!"

<b>

I'm being hit unilaterally! It doesn't hurt at all!

My attacks are being dodged and not hitting!! Ugh!!!

<b>

"Phew, it's a draw. I worked up a good sweat. Now, I'm going to take a bath, Karina! Come on!"

"Ah, ah. Mashiro-san, you're so forceful, but I like that...!"

"Oh, and next time, that defense magic is banned too. It's just not training at all."

<b>

"Eek. I-I don't mind. I have the strongest space magic even without training, you knowーー!!"
