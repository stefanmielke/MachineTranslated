# I agree. You can abuse it in many ways.

I changed the bath water. Whew, I got soaked in the long bath. ......

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I got excited in the bath and overdid it.

"Ugh, I love this animal ......"

But you didn't resist, and neither did Karina. But you didn't resist, and neither did Karina."

<blank>

I certainly didn't, but you know. I was so weak if I didn't do any ...... enhancements, and on the other hand, Masilo was so powerful and, well, you know. I just said it was great.

<blank>

Mr. Masillo looks happy as he dries and brushes his hair with the magic of life.

I like the moist Mashiro-san, but I also like the fluffy one. I like it.

<blank>

"Well, I guess I can use the bath as much as I want, even if it's only for the duration of the commission.

What?　I don't mind using it even after the commission is over?"

<blank>

When I say this, Masilo-san opens his mouth a little and tilts his head.

<blank>

What are you talking about? I am an adventurer in Carcassa. I'm an adventurer in Carcassa, and I have no intention of leaving this town.　Or do you want to live here too?　You're welcome to stay with us, it's convenient for many things.

I'll make a door leading to here at Mr. Masiello's house. I'll make a door leading to this place at Mr. Masiello's house. You can come and go whenever you want."

What about?"

<blank>

Mashiro's eyes widen in surprise. Oh, didn't I tell you?

<blank>

Wait a minute. Isn't this in the backpack?"

Hmm?"　That's not true. The backpack is only connected to here ......, so if you want, you can walk a few steps from the back of the dungeon to Masilo's house via here. On the contrary, if I were in another town, it would be a few steps there as well.

I'm not smart, but I know that's a bad idea. I'm not smart, but I know it's bad.

<blank>

I agree. It can be abused in many ways.

<blank>

So I'm going to put a few restrictions on Mr. Masiello's activities here, but please understand.

"Oh, oh. Well, if you say you can take a bath anytime, I have no complaints at all.

<blank>

You really like baths. ......

Oh, and by the way, there was plenty of Masilo's body hair in the hot water I changed, so I can only say that I am convinced that he is usually hated in the bath house. It's clogging the drains.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Here is Masilo's room. There is no furniture, but here is the key.

"Oh!　Next to the bathtub!"

<blank>

When I made the room and handed him the key, Masilo-san smiled so happily that it was easy to tell even from his dog face.

After the request is completed, we will build a direct route to Mr. Masilo's house inside this room.

<blank>

I thought to myself, "This place is so spacious. Not only is it bigger than our house, but it could fit an entire guild.

You asked for it to be reasonably wide, Mr. Masiello."

"It's good for exercise, isn't it?　It's kind of weird how it's dark like a dungeon, but it's bright and you can see better."

<blank>

The space is like a gymnasium. Basketball and volleyball could be played, if the equipment and members existed.

<blank>

"All right, Karina, let's get right to it, shall we?　You are not allowed to use magic. I'll do it with my bare hands.

I'm a wizard, and that's a terrible rule, isn't it?"

I don't blame you. You can only enhance your body.

<blank>

Pfft, you idiot. I never lose when I'm invincible!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

There was a time when I thought ...... was the way to go.

<blank>

Don't beat me mercilessly in the face just because it doesn't work!　I'm scared, scared, scared!

Hey!　Don't you dare close your eyes. This is not a training exercise!　Endure!　If you don't like it, kick me out of the way or something!

<blank>

I get hit one way or the other!　It doesn't hurt at all, though!

My attacks are evaded and don't hit...!　Mangan!

<blank>

Hoo, that's a tie. I worked up a good sweat. Let's go take a bath, Karina!　Come on!

I'm not sure what to do with it. Masiro-san is so pushy, but I like that ......!"

And next time, don't use that defensive magic. It's too much like training."

<blank>

Hee... No, it's okay. I have the strongest spatial magic without training!
