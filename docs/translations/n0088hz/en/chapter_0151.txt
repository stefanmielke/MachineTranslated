# You understand the language here, don't you?

"Picking up a dragon and making it into a pet is ...... pretty substandard of your sister Carina, too."

I'm not sure if it's too late for that, Dear Sir. I can only say that you are ...... amazing."

<blank>

In the meantime, when I introduced dragons to Dia and Isiah, they responded in this somewhat optimistic manner.

Thank goodness they didn't say, "Go back to where you were!" I'm glad they didn't say, "Return it to where you were!

<blank>

I'm so happy to meet you!　Nice to meet you, Pisembangs!"

He says hello.

<blank>

I will translate the greeting. I told them both that I had learned dragon language skills.

<blank>

Oh, yes. It's my pleasure. You are very quiet. The dragons I know are more like disasters. I am surprised when they bow down to me in such a quiet manner.

"Aruji-sama, what is the name of this dragon?"

<blank>

When asked by Isiah, it occurred to me that I had not heard his name.

<blank>

"Hey, he said it's a name. What's his name?"

My name is (untranslatable)!

Hmm?　What?"

I'm sorry, I can't translate it.

<blank>

It's just a noise sound like "Gyaogee," or something like that.

No, it seems to be exactly the same as the dragon's cry only there. Perhaps there is no corresponding word for the name, so it cannot be translated.

<blank>

I don't understand it as it is in a language we don't have. Can I just call it whatever I want to call it?

I'll accept anything if you can put it on me!　I'll accept anything if Miss.

Porgy?　It's a common dog name in my country. ...... Or is Porgy a bit too retro for you these days?"

'Um, I'd like a name that at least sounds like a dragon. ......'

<blank>

What the heck, if you have a request, just say it from the beginning. You can't just say "anything".

<blank>

"Dia, give him a cool dragon name."

What?　You don't mind if I put it on?"

"Yeah, he says it's good."

'What?　I want to be followed by Miss.

I say it's good, so you have nothing to complain about, right?"

I'm sorry, I don't think so!　Miss!　Nice to meet you, Miss Dia!

<blank>

Thunder dragon with a firm posture.

<blank>

I've never named a dragon before!　What should I do, Bahamut?

"Wait, Mr. Dear, that's the nickname of my uncle's opponent.

'Ummm, if it covers an existing dragon's name, there might be a problem in the dragon community, so avoid those.'

'Oh, got it. ...... Well, can you just kind of shake your head if you have any problems?　If OK, please shake it vertically."

I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Dia!　Nice to meet you, Mr. Dia!

<blank>

Thunder Dragon nods its head in agreement.

I'm glad to see that you seem to be getting along so quickly. That's what I'd expect from you, Dia.

<blank>

"Dear Sir or Madam, this dragon understands our language, doesn't it? This dragon understands our language, right?　If so, I have written our language on the board in advance, so that you can talk with other people besides yourself.

Oh, that's a good idea. Isiah is so smart."

"ehehe......"

<blank>

So, while Dear was thinking of dragon names, Isiah and I decided to make a vocabulary book.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Woohoo, I'm here to take a bath ......aaaaaah!　Do-do-do-do-dragonoooo!　Hey Karina!　What the hell did you pick up?　Return this dangerous thing to its original place!

<blank>

Ah, welcome Mr. Masilo. Oh, and thanks for the reaction, as expected in a way.
