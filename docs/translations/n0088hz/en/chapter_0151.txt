# Do you understand these words?

<b>

"Picking up a dragon to keep as a pet... Karina Onee-san's standards are quite extraordinary, aren't they?"

"That's a bit late to say, Dear-sama. I can only say that Master is... amazing in some way."

<b>

For the time being, when I introduced the dragon to Dia-kun and Aisia, I received a response that seemed somewhat enlightened.

Thank goodness they didn't say, "Take it back to where it came from!"

<b>

"Yo! Nice to meet you, seniors!"

"Nice to meet you too."

<b>

I translated the greeting. I told the two that I had learned dragon language skills.

<b>

"Ah, yes. Nice to meet you too. It's kind of... calm, isn't it? The dragons I know have more of a disaster-like image. I'm surprised it can bow its head so calmly like this."

"Master, what is this dragon's name?"

<b>

When Aisia asked, I realized that I hadn't asked for its name.

<b>

"Hey, what's your name?"

"My name is (unable to translate)!"

"Huh? What?"

"(Unable to translate)!"

<b>

It only sounds like a noise, like "Gyaogii."

No, to be precise, it feels like that part is just the dragon's cry. Probably, there are no words corresponding to its name, so it can't be translated.

<b>

"It seems that it's a word that doesn't exist in our language, so we can't understand it as is. Can we just give it a name?"

"Sure! If you give me a name, I'll accept anything!"

"How about Pochi? It's a common dog name in our country... though these days, there aren't many Pochis left... maybe that's a bit too retro?"

"Um, I'd prefer a name that sounds more like a dragon..."

<b>

What the heck, if you have a request, just say it from the start. Saying anything is just nonsense.

<b>

"Dia-kun, give it a cool name that sounds like a dragon."

"Eh! Is it okay for me to name it?"

"Yeah, it's saying it's fine."

"Eh!? I want to be named by you, Onee-san—"

"Since I'm saying it's fine, you have no complaints, right?"

"—None! Onee-san! Please take care of me, Dia-kun!"

<b>

The Thunder Dragon straightens its posture sharply.

<b>

"I'm naming a dragon for the first time! What should I do, Bahamut or something?"

"Wait, Dia-kun, that's the nickname of my uncle's rival, so hold on."

"Hmm, if it has the same name as an existing dragon, there might be issues in dragon society, so let's avoid that."

"Ah, understood. ...Um, if there's a problem, could you shake your head sideways? If it's okay, please nod up and down."

"Sure! I'll be counting on you, Dia-kun!"

<b>

The Thunder Dragon nods vigorously.

It's great that we seem to be able to get along right away. As expected of Dia-kun.

<b>

"Master, this dragon understands our language, right? If so, we could write our words on a board in advance, and then it could converse with others besides Master."

"Oh, that's a good idea. Aisia is smart."

"Hehe..."

<b>

So, while Dia-kun is thinking of a name for the dragon, Aisia and I decided to create a vocabulary list.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Yo, I came to take a bath... Huh!? W-w-wait, a dragon—!? Hey, Karina! What the hell did you pick up!? Take this dangerous thing back to where it came from!"

<b>

Ah, welcome, Mashiro-san. And thank you for the reaction I expected in a way.
