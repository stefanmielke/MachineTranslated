# The Stomach of a Powerful Monster (Mashiro's Perspective)

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Well, it might not mean much, but it's part of the job, you know? Keeping watch."

"Y-yeah."

<b>

Saying that, Karina led Mashiro to what seemed to be the living room. Mashiro sat on the couch that Karina had suggested.

<b>

"Wow, I can't believe you can really carry a base in a backpack..."

"Yeah, technically it's my magic, so the backpack is just for show."

"O-oh, is that so?"

<b>

Mashiro, feeling a bit at a loss, wondered what to do while sitting next to Karina, who was relaxing on the couch. Just then, someone arrived.

It was an elf girl wearing a cute green dress.

<b>

"Oh, is that a guest? You're the beastman adventurer we talked about the other day, right?"

"Ah, Dia, I'm back! This is Mashiro. Isn't she cute?"

<b>

Elves, who rarely leave their country, are quite a rare sight.

Since she was introduced, Mashiro gave a slight bow to greet her.

<b>

"Whether I'm cute or not is beside the point, I'm the adventurer Mashiro. ...Um, nice to meet you, young lady."

"Yes, I'm Dia. And I'm a boy."

"Huh?"

<b>

Mashiro tilted her head.

...Looking closely, Dia's build could indeed be mistaken for a boy.

<b>

"My sister said that, um, this looks better."

"Oh... Karina's. Well, I guess there's no helping it...?"

"Yeah, well."

<b>

Mashiro had also been made to wear socks since the other day. She understood that it was probably a similar situation.

<b>

"Eh, that's no good. Today is a day when you can wear either outfit, right? Yet Dia chose to dress like a girl!"

"Th-that’s because! Th-this looks more like what my sister likes!"

"Really? Hmm, I guess that's true."

<b>

While saying that, Karina hugged Dia. Dia, who was being hugged, had a somewhat troubled expression, but his face turned red with happiness.

<b>

"Wait, you just moved in an instant!?"

"That's magic too."

"I don't know much about magic, but that's amazing. Let's have a match sometime. I could even do it right now if you want."

"Sure. Just know that if I go all out, Mashiro-san won't stand a chance!"

"…That’s true."

<b>

After all, Mashiro was cornered by a Black Mantis, while Karina effortlessly took it down. She couldn't even imagine a scenario where her attacks would work against the defensive power that could shatter the Black Mantis's scythe.

<b>

<b>

"So, you show me such a secret... what do you want me to do?"

"Huh? Um, you see, we're going to be working together to monitor the core for the next few days, right?"

"Yeah."

"And it feels a bit guilty to just go back to the base and lounge around by myself..."

"…"

<b>

Mashiro pressed her hand against her temple.

Guilt. Was that really the only reason she revealed her secret?

<b>

"How about I make a room for you too?"

"Are you suggesting we surround ourselves like that elf girl... boy?"

"Huh? That might be nice in its own way."

"What if I spill this secret? ...No, I guess I could just erase it."

<b>

Mashiro felt as if she had come to the stomach of a powerful monster.

If she wanted to, Karina could easily erase Mashiro or dispose of her body.

<b>

<b>

"I wouldn't do anything so dangerous. W-w-we're friends, right? Us!"

"Ah, yeah. I'm glad to hear you think that way too, Karina."

<b>

For now, it was clear that she didn't want to be an enemy. And if she was an ally, that was incredibly reassuring.

Thus, Mashiro readily acknowledged her friendship with Karina. In fact, she already thought they were more than just acquaintances.

<b>

...They had slept together and had been cuddled a lot, but the fact that she didn't mind that was a secret from Karina.
