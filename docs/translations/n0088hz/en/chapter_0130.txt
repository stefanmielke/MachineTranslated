# The Stomach of a Mighty Demon (Masilo's Perspective)

<blank>

Well, maybe it doesn't make much sense, but it's my job. And watch."

Oh, oh.

<blank>

With these words, Karina took Masilo to a place that might be the living room. Masilo sat on the couch that Kalina recommended.

<blank>

What a great idea, you can really carry your base in a backpack. ......

'Oh, technically it's my magic, so the backpack is just free decoration.

Oh, oh. I see."

<blank>

Karina is sitting on the couch, and Masilo is looking at her, wondering what he should do with this. Then, someone came along.

She was an elf girl in a pretty green dress.

<blank>

Oh, is that a customer? You must be the beastly adventurer I mentioned the other day?"

Oh, Dear, I'm back. My name is Masilo. Isn't he cute?

<blank>

Elves, who don't get out of the country very often, are quite rare.

As he was introduced, Masilo bowed lightly and greeted him in passing.

<blank>

'Cute or not, I'm Masilo, the adventurer. ...... Well, nice to meet you, missy."

Yes, I'm Dia. And I am a man.

Hmm?"

<blank>

Mashiro tilted his head.

If you look closely at ...... you can see that the skeleton does not look like a boy.

<blank>

My sister said, well, it's better this way.

"Oh ...... Carina's. So, yeah, no choice. ......?"

Yeah, well.

<blank>

Masilo has also been forced to leave his socks on the other day. I was convinced that it must be similar.

<blank>

I'm like, "Oh, no. Today is a day when you can dress either way, right?　But you chose to dress up as a girl, didn't you?

I'm not sure!　This one is more to your liking!

Eh?　Hmmm, it does."

<blank>

Kalina hugged Dia as she said this. Dia, who was on the receiving end of the hug, looked slightly annoyed, but blushed happily.

<blank>

You just moved in an instant, didn't you!"

That's magic, too."

I'm not that familiar with magic. I'm glad you don't know that much about magic. We can start right now if you want."

I'm fine with that. But if I get serious, Mr. Masiello won't be able to help me, though!"

...... that's true."

<blank>

Mashiro had Black Mantis cornered, and Kalina was easily able to finish it off. In the first place, it was hard to imagine Mashiro's attack being effective against the Black Mantis' scythe-crushing defense.

<blank>

<blank>

And. What do you want me to ...... do when you show me these secrets?"

Hmm?"　Let's see. You know, we're going to be working together for the next few days monitoring the core, right?"

Ah."

"And yet you feel guilty about silently going back to your base and moping around on your own. ......

"......"

<blank>

Mashiro pressed his hands to his temples.

Guilt. Is that really the only reason why he revealed his secret?

<blank>

If you want, we can make room for Mr. Masiello."

"You want me to surround myself like that little elf ...... boy?　You want me to surround myself like that elf girl  boy?"

Hmm?"　That might be a good idea."

What if Atashi tells the whole world about this or something?" ...... No, I can just turn it off."

<blank>

Mashiro felt like he had just stumbled into the stomach of a mighty demon.

If she wanted to, Carina could always make Masilo disappear or destroy his body.

<blank>

<blank>

I wouldn't do anything so dangerous. We are friends, aren't we?　We are!

'Ah, yes. I'm glad you feel that way too, Karina."

<blank>

For now, they are definitely not someone you want to antagonize. And if they are allies, they could not be more reliable.

Therefore, Masilo readily admitted that he and Karina were friends. In fact, even Masilo thought they were more than acquaintances.

<blank>

It's a secret to Karina that I slept with ...... and got miffed a lot, but it's also because I didn't really mind it.
