# They say you have to make a sacrifice.

<blank>

According to the hooded woman, her hometown is currently under attack by dragons and she has to offer sacrifices.

<blank>

'Hmmm. So you mean you don't care about ......!

"Well, can I help you?"

I can't help you because I'm your pet now!　Besides, you said it was amazing that you could talk to dragons, but if you were asked to sacrifice, doesn't that mean you talked to the dragon?

Huh?"　If you ask me, yes."

<blank>

This means that someone has negotiated with the dragon.

<blank>

Oh, um, Mr. Dragon. A little slower ......"

Where's Dia?　I'm talking to you right now, Dia. I mean, you're the one who's supposed to be talking to me, you lowlife. I'll crush you.

Hee?

<blank>

The robed woman, who couldn't keep up with Arthur's wordbook skills, was frightened and backed away when he pointed grimly at "I'll crush you" with a thump.

<blank>

"Hey, Arthur. Don't scare me too much."

No, I'm just hanging on."

<blank>

Arthur smiles wickedly. Of course, he is serious, but he doesn't say that.

<blank>

And, of course, it was impossible for a robed woman who had never met a dragon before to read its expression, so from her point of view, it looked like Arthur stopped while frowning in disapproval after being rebuked by the priestess princess.

<blank>

But the dragon asked for a sacrifice, didn't he?　I think some ignorant lower creature might have done something that needs to be settled. It's common to rob an egg.

'Oh, you're talking about the limited number of children you can have. No wonder you're angry when they take them away from you. ......"

Well, they're unfertilized eggs anyway. I guess they were just trying to scare us into bringing them something to eat.

What?"　So you demand people be sacrificed?"

I would prefer to sacrifice orcs, because humans are a little ...... low-yield. If you're looking for magic, I'd prefer a magic stone. If there is a person with very high magic power, it is different.

<blank>

That's the way it is, Diah agreed. If you put a human and a more tasty-looking prey side by side, you would take the one that looks tastier unless there are other circumstances.

<blank>

'Uh, you know. Sacrifice, what's it like to be asked to do that?"

Oh, yes, Miko-sama! ...... Uh, what's it like?"

'I'm talking about how it was actually negotiated. In some cases, I heard that orcs and magic stones, which are more palatable, are preferred?　Were you specifically asked for a human?"

<blank>

When Dia said this, the robed woman's eyes widened in surprise.

<blank>

...... Is that so?　In my village, it is the custom to offer an unsullied virgin to appease the wrath of the dragon-sama.

Ah, the tradition type. He's a nasty guy. He was demanding to bring the head of the egg thief, but I think he's the kind of guy who, after the decision is made that he's done with it because he offered the sacrifice anyway, continues on without regard to the will of the dragon.

<blank>

From the dragon's point of view, it takes a lot to remember the face of a lowly creature. They think, "So this is the thief. That's how it seems to be.

After that, it seems that every time there is an egg thief, a dragon will attack to seek revenge, and it will become customary to repeat the successful experience and offer a sacrifice.

<blank>

"There must be some dragons that don't like to heat up eggs very much.

Do you really heat up eggs that much?"

Practice with unfertilized eggs. My mom told me. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to practice with my mother's eggs, but I'd like to practice with my mother's eggs. ...... I'm not sure what to expect.　I was like, "I don't care if it's stolen,......."

"With unfertilized eggs ...... Oh, so that's why you said 'unfertilized eggs anyway' earlier."

I'm a dummy to protect the real ones. I sometimes warm unfertilized eggs together with dummies to protect the real ones.

<blank>

I had heard that even if you steal eggs from a dragon's nest out of fear for your life, they rarely hatch. I almost got sidetracked into an interesting story.

It's not unreasonable, of course, to be more concerned about your friend's story than the circumstances of the person in the robe in front of you.

<blank>

Well, I think there are probably a lot of misconceptions out there.

I think that if we talk to him and correct the misunderstanding, then perhaps a sacrifice will not be necessary. If we can talk to them and correct their misunderstandings, then perhaps sacrifices may not be necessary.

Is that so!"　Oh, um, miko princess!　Oh, please, please help us ......!

<blank>

And Dia, who is bowed down.

Well, what is going on? I think.

<blank>

In the meantime, I'll talk to your sister about it."

<blank>

To begin with, if it is a priestess who can speak with dragons, then the real priestess is Kalina. Dia is only talking to Arthur, who has been disciplined by Kalina to use a vocabulary book.
