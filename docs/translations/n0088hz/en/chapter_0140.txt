# Did I go a bit too far?

<b>

After humiliating the Beebees with the baby palanquin, I handed them over to the Adventurers' Guild as promised.

Of course, I secretly retrieved the socks I had kept on them.

<b>

"The culprits have only been saying 'babu' since then."

"Oh, I already lifted the curse, but... did I go a bit too far?"

<b>

I was complained at by Guild Master Garoon.

<b>

Even though it was called a curse, I merely used spatial magic to twist their throats and mouths, forcibly converting their speech into "Babu" or "Ogyā," so it wasn't really a curse in the true sense.

I did it because I could, but it was a real hassle since it was manual.

<b>

This time, aside from the socks, I copied various materials I had on hand to make pacifiers, diapers, and the palanquin. It was a special occasion with a generous use of spatial magic since I planned to use them once.

The used items were disposed of since they were dirty.

<b>

The golem was the one I received from Gomez at Verarudo. Dear-kun adjusted it to move well. I had plenty of magic stones I hunted in the dungeon, so I wasn't in trouble.

<b>

"By the way, is there any information you want to ask them now?"

"…Thinking about it, it's indeed unnecessary, but I wanted to keep their testimonies."

"If that's the case, then I can say I kept them. If I guarantee that they said so, there shouldn't be a problem, right?"

<b>

Since verifying whether the testimony is true would require separate confirmation anyway.

<b>

"Hmm. If you put it that way, I suppose that's true."

"Anyway, hurry up and give me my reward. We're tired, and we want to go home quickly."

"You did well, Shirogane. Yes, I will give you your reward."

<b>

Then, I was handed a surprisingly heavy bag for its appearance. When I looked inside, there were twenty gold coins.

…Equivalent to twenty million yen! (According to Karina-chan's research)

<b>

"…Yes. I have indeed received it."

<b>

I was surprised by the unexpected large sum, but since I was a healer now, I accepted it with a nonchalant face. I'm glad my robe was hiding my face.

<b>

"Hey, Guild Master. You're not very considerate; at least break it down into silver coins. It's hard to use like this."

"You're going to deposit it anyway, right? I can exchange it if you want."

"Yeah. What about the healer?"

"Ah, then I will also deposit half. Please turn the remaining half into large gold coins."

"Hmm, that one, huh. Understood, I will hand it over right away."

<b>

Since it was a good opportunity, I decided to receive it in large gold coins, which I had never seen before.

I mean, I want to see it, right? Right?

<b>

<b>

So, both of us returned the bag, and I received one large gold coin.

Oh, it's about twice the size of a regular gold coin. This is a large gold coin…!

<b>

"Alright, let's go, healer. See you later, Guild Master."

"I leave the rest to you. Lord Garoon."

"Ah. You really helped me this time. If anything comes up again, please rely on me."

<b>

Being pulled by Mashiro-san, I left the Adventurers' Guild.

I left everything else to the Adventurers' Guild. Good luck.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I was brought into Mashiro-san's house, where I removed my disguise and returned to being Karina-chan.

<b>

"Wow, that turned out to be quite an income. I can live off this for a while."

"Hey, Mashiro-san, was it really okay to receive this much reward? Twenty gold coins, that's forty for the two of us."

"Of course! It was a crisis for this town. If we hadn't been here, the 'Shining Sword' guys would have caused tremendous damage by destroying the dungeon, you know?"

<b>

Now that you mention it, that's certainly true.

If I hadn't found the bomb, it was highly likely that they would have successfully blown up the dungeon. Considering that, the reward might even be cheap.

<b>

"More importantly, look, the door! Please make one around here... or should we just move to a nice place with this reward?"

"If you're moving, you can just make the door again then."

"That's true. Then I'll ask you to do it here."

"Okay. Here we go."

<b>

I made the door as instructed. I also need to buy a door soon; the locked door from the pirate's base is likely to be out of stock soon. …I wonder if I can ask the dwarf to make one for me?

<b>

"Alright! After I take a bath, let's celebrate with Aisia's food! I'm going to drink too!"

"Oh. I actually want to go somewhere first."

"Huh? Got it. Then I'll go take a bath first."

<b>

Mashiro-san charged toward the storage space base.

Mashiro-san really loves baths too much.

<b>

"Then I guess I'll take care of my work... time to make the delivery!"

<b>

I headed to the church.

Honestly, I really want to deliver the Beebees' socks quickly.

…I've saved a copy of Mashiro-san's socks, though. Hehehe.

(Sorry for not having illustrations lately.

I thought about having AI output the forced baby play, but just imagining it was hell, so I decided against it.)
