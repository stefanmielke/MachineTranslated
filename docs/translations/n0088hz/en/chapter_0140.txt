# Did I go a little overboard?

<blank>

After humiliating Beebe and his friends with a baby palanquin, he turned them over to the Adventurers' Guild as promised.

Of course, I collected the socks that had been left on the floor.

<blank>

"The culprits have stopped saying anything but 'bubu.'

'Oh, I've already lifted the cursed grimoire, but did I ...... overdo it a bit?'

<blank>

The guildmaster, Garoon, complained so to me.

<blank>

It's not really a curse, just a forced conversion to "baboo" or "ogyaa" by using spatial magic to twist the throat and mouth movements.

I tried to do it because I could, but it was very tedious because it was manual.

<blank>

Except for the socks, the pacifiers, diapers, and palanquin were made by copying various materials I had on hand. Since the plan was to use them all up, the space magic was a special treat.

The used aleatoric has already disappeared because it is so fragile.

<blank>

The golem is the one I got from Gomez at Velarde. Dia did a great job adjusting it to work. I hunted a lot of magic stones in the dungeon, so I didn't have any trouble.

<blank>

I mean, do you have any information you want to ask them now?"

......It's certainly unnecessary on second thought, but I wish I'd kept the testimonials."

If that is the case, then you can say that I have kept it. If I assure you that they said so, there will be no problem, right?"

<blank>

It needs to be verified separately whether the testimony is true or not anyway.

<blank>

Mmmm. Well, if you put it that way."

I'm tired, I want to go home. We are tired and want to go home.

I'll give you your reward. Well, I'll give you your reward."

<blank>

He handed me a bag that was rather bulky in comparison to its appearance. I looked inside and found 20 gold coins.

...... equivalent to 20 million Japanese yen! (according to Karina-chan)

<blank>

"...... Mm-hmm. Certainly received."

<blank>

I was surprised at the unexpectedly large sum of money, but since I am now a healer, I take it with a nonchalant look on my face. I'm glad my face is hidden by my robe.

<blank>

"Hey, Guillermas! You're not very smart, at least break it up into medium-sized silver coins, they're hard to use."

"You're going to leave it with me anyway, aren't you?　If you want to exchange money, I'll accept it."

'Marna. What about the healer?"

"Ah, well, I'll leave half of mine with you. The other half I would rather have as a large gold coin."

"Oh, that way. All right, I'll give it to you right away."

<blank>

I decided to take the opportunity and get it for a large gold coin that I had not yet seen.

Because you want to see it, don't you?　Right?

<blank>

<blank>

So we both returned the bag and I received one large gold coin.

Oh, it's about two times bigger than a regular gold coin. This is the large gold coin ......!

<blank>

Healer: "All right, let's go, healer. See you later, Guilmas."

I'll leave the rest to you. "Garoon."

I was really grateful this time. Thank you so much for your help this time. If you need anything else, please let me know.

<blank>

As Mashiro pulled me along, I left the Adventurers' Guild.

Everything else will be left to the Adventurers Guild. Good luck.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I was taken into Mr. Masiello's house, and I took off my disguise and became Karina again.

<blank>

I've made quite a bit of money. I can live off of it for a while."

Hey, Mr. Masiello, did you really deserve this much in rewards?　It's 20 gold coins, 40 for the two of us."

The town was in danger. If we hadn't been there and the Shining Sword guys had destroyed the dungeon, there would have been a lot of damage, you know?

<blank>

If you ask me, it's true.

If I had not found the bomb in the first place, it is highly likely that I would have succeeded in blowing up the dungeon as usual. Considering that, it is probably a rather inexpensive reward.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to do with the money. Make it around here ...... or better yet, move to a better place with this reward?"

If you move, then you just have to rebuild the door."

I'll take that too. I'll take care of it here then."

Yes," he said. Ho, ho, ho."

<blank>

I make doors as I am told. I'll have to buy a door too - I'm about to run out of locked doors from the pirate stronghold. I wonder if I can ask ...... Mr. Dwarf to make one for me?

<blank>

"Alright, after we take a bath, we're going to launch with Aisia's food!　After we take a bath, we're going to launch with Aisia's food!　And we're gonna drink some booze!"

I've got to go on ahead. I have someplace I need to go first."

Hmm?"　Okay, I'll go ahead and take a bath. Then I'll take a bath first."

<blank>

Mr. Masiello charged into the base of the storage space.

You really love baths too much, Mashiro-san.

<blank>

'Well then, I'd better go get some work done, too. ...... Now it's time to deliver!'

<blank>

I head to the church.

Frankly, I am very eager to quickly deliver the socks of the Beebeys.

...... I did save a copy of Masilo's socks, though. Hehehe.

(Sorry for the lack of illustrations lately.

I was thinking of having the AI output the forced baby play,

I had to stop because it was hell just imagining it.)
