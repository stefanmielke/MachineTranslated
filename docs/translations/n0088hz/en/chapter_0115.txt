# Yes, it suits you, Dia-sama! (Aisia's perspective)

<b>

"Well then, I'm off to continue the dungeon exploration. I should be back by tonight, but if I'm not back, feel free to have dinner without me!"

"Yes, have a good time, big sister!"

"Safe travels, my master!"

<b>

We waved goodbye to our master as he headed towards the dungeon. Just as he entered the spatial hole, Dia-sama called out to me.

<b>

"Aisia-san. By the way, your big sister was sleeping in your room, right? And before that, she was sleeping with your little sister too."

"Yes. She did sleep with us."

"Um... how close are you with your big sister? Your little sister mentioned something about her being a lover."

"What do you mean by 'how close'?"

"Um, well..."

<b>

Noticing Dia-sama's ears turning red and her shy demeanor as she avoided eye contact, I realized she was asking about our master's affection.

Oh my, it seems Dia-sama is curious about such things. Hehe, I understand! Dia-sama is trying to hide her feelings for our master, but it's not hidden at all!

<b>

"Dia-sama... our master dislikes men."

"Is that so?"

"However, I believe you have a chance. The fact that our master keeps you close is a clear indication of that."

"Really? But, um, your big sister is dating your little sister..."

"That's fine. Since they're both girls, it doesn't count, and Sati was only joking. Our master is essentially free."

<b>

Well, part of that seems to be serious, but that's that.

<b>

"Dia-sama, to receive our master's affection, you should become cuter...!"

"Affection? What do you mean by that?"

"When you're dressed as a girl, you're clearly being pampered, right!? That means what I'm saying is true! If you become more feminine, our master will surely make a move!"

"I-I see? But, um, it's not like I'm wishing for that or anything..."

<b>

Oh, how frustrating!

<b>

"If you keep indulging in the elf's shyness, other races will die of old age! Is that okay with you, Dia-sama?!"

"N-No, it's not okay!"

"Then let's dress you up as a girl for our master's sake! There are places in Calcutta that sell accessories!"

"Um, I'm not very knowledgeable about such things. Will you help me?"

"Yes, I'd be happy to!!"

<b>

<b>

Thus, we began our strategy of "dressing up cutely and enticing our master while he's in the dungeon."

Well, since I had already made a move the other day, I was in a graceful mood to accompany Dia-sama. Hehe.

<b>

By the way, the accessories in Calcutta are either extravagant gifts for courtesans or cute items for female adventurers that aren't too flashy. This time, we headed to the latter type of store for Dia-sama.

<b>

"Hmm. I wonder which one would suit your big sister... Aisia-san, how about this one?" "Oh, it's cute! I think Dia-sama has great taste. Our master likes simple things like that. Would it be okay to wrap it around your body and say, 'This is my present'?"

"I see. So there's a fashion of wrapping ribbons around the body."

<b>

Ah, she doesn't realize that this means being naked with a ribbon. Well, that's fine.

<b>

"Yes, it definitely suits you, Dia-sama!"

"Is that so? Hmm, then, um, should I buy it?"

"Of course. I'll explain the basics on the way back so our master won't find out. And this time, let me buy it!"

<b>

So, I purchased Dia-sama's ribbon.

Huh? Why am I paying for it? Hehe. It's to prevent Dia-sama from complaining! If she bought it with her own money, she might complain later!

<b>

And if it goes well, it will create the fact that "Dia-sama is giving a present from me to our master"! Um, the price is... huh? Per meter...?

I see. This is a tricky one.

<b>

"Oh, it's sold by weight. Can you buy it properly?"

"Don't underestimate me!"

<b>

As I usually tried to show my wallet to the clerk to get the right amount, I suddenly remembered that I had been studying "arithmetic."

Now is the time for the "arithmetic" that our master taught me! Um, um...

<b>

"Yes, I would like one silver coin and four large copper coins."

<b>

I bought it! I managed to shop properly, master!!

<b>

"How about it, Dia-sama? I can shop too!"

"That's right, you did well."

"Hehe... but please don't treat me like a child! I'm an adult lady, you know!?"

"I'm sorry, it just slipped out. Oh, shall we buy something else too?"

<b>

Goodness. Oh, I need to explain how to use the ribbon on the way back.

…………

……

<b>

"—So, the correct way is to intentionally adorn oneself with a ribbon while being completely unclothed."

"Wh-what!? That means it's underwear!"

"Oh? Is that where you're embarrassed?"

"Give it back! I'll hold it myself!"

"Eh, but I can't let a slave like me make Dia-sama carry things. It's underwear after all!"

"It's fine, I can carry something like this myself. I can't let you carry it, Aisia-san… it is underwear, after all!"

<b>

Oh my, how cute. I see why our master keeps her close.

But our master has made her wear girls' underwear, so it feels a bit late to be concerned about that.

<b>

<b>

And when we returned from shopping, we found our master collapsed in the living area.

To be precise, he was lying on the couch, looking utterly exhausted.

<b>

"Master!?"

"Big sister! Are you okay!?"

"Ugh... ah, welcome back, you two. Yeah, I'm fine... I just need to rest a bit before heading back to the dungeon... ugh."

<b>

Clearly, our master did not look fine at all.

The fact that something in the depths of the dungeon could leave even our strong master in such a state...! How terrifying, the dungeon!

<b>

"Excuse me, master. You should really rest for today..."

"No, um, I just had a little brain overload, so I'm fine..."

"That's serious! If your brain spills out, you'll die! Please rest properly! Dia-sama, let's carry our master to his room, help me!"

"Ah, um, okay. Yes... Big sister, can you stand?"

"Ugh..."

<b>

And our master was supported by both me and Dia-sama, making our way to his bed.

Sniff sniff... the scent of our master is strong in this room. It's intoxicating.

<b>

No, no, no. Master, please get better soon...!
