# Yes, it suits Dear! (Isiah's point of view)

<blank>

I'm going to continue the dungeon crawl. I'll probably be back at night, but if I don't come back, you can go ahead and have dinner or something.

"Yes, go ahead, sister."

"Good day to you, my dear!"

<blank>

We saw Aruji-sama off to the dungeon alone. As I waved my hand and entered the hole in space, Dia-sama called out to me.

<blank>

Ms. Aithea. I remember that your sister used to sleep in your room, didn't she?　And before that, you slept with your sister."

Yes, sir. You let me sleep with you."

"...... Well, how well do you and your sister know each other?　Your sister said she was your girlfriend or something."

How much, you say?"

Well, you know. Um, ......."

<blank>

I was struck by Dear, who was reddening the tips of her ears and fidgeting and asking me questions without making eye contact. I knew he was asking about my favor.

Well, well, well... Dear seems to be interested in such things, doesn't she? I understand, don't I?　You are trying to hide your love for the boss, but you are not hiding it at all!

<blank>

Dear Dear. ......The Lord is a man hater."

......I knew it?"

I think Dia-sama has a pulse. It's clear when the man-hating Aruji-sama keeps him by his side, isn't it?"

I don't know if that's true.　Oh, but, you know, your sister is dating your sister."

I'm fine. We are women, so there is no problem, and Sati is only half joking. You are practically free.

<blank>

Well, it sounds half-serious, but it is what it is.

<blank>

Dear Dia-sama. I thought I should be prettier to win your favor, ......!"

"Your Grace, you know."

'You're clearly more spoiled when you're dressed as a girl!　That's what I mean!　If you become more of a girl, then Aruji-sama will touch you!"

'Oh, I see?　Oh, no, that's not what I want, though, is it?"

<blank>

Oh my god, I'm so frustrated!

<blank>

If we keep up with the elves' seclusion, the rest of the race will die of longevity!　Are you sure you're okay with that, Master Dia!

No, it's not good.

'Well then, let's get the girls all dressed up for Aruji-sama!　There are places here in Carcassa that sell accessories and stuff!"

I'm not very familiar with ....... Can you help me?"

Yes, with pleasure!"

<blank>

<blank>

Thus, we began a strategy of "dress up prettily, seduce them, and get them to lay their hands on us while the Master is in the dungeon.

Well, I was taken care of the other day, so I'm going to accompany Mr. Dear in a graceful mood. Heh heh.

<blank>

Incidentally, there are two types of accessories in Carcassa: the flamboyant ones that are gifts for prostitutes, and the less flashy and cute ones for female adventurers. This time, I went to the latter for Lady Dia.

<blank>

'Hmmm. Which one is your sister's favorite, ...... How about this one, Isiah?" Oh, it's so cute!　I think Dia-sama has good taste, after all. The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you want to do. I think it would be a good idea to wrap it around your body and say, "I am your present.

I see. So there's a fashionable way to wrap ribbons around your body."

<blank>

Oh, you don't understand that this is a ribbon on a naked body. Oh well.

<blank>

(Such ignorance and innocence also suits you.) Yes, it suits you, Deere-sama!

I see." "Really?　Hmm, then, well, I guess I'll buy one. Let me know if there is any manner of winding or meaning to it."

Of course. I'll give you the gist of it on the way home so that you don't get caught by the boss. And this time, let me buy it!"

<blank>

and I will buy a ribbon from Master Deere.

What?　Why am I paying for this?　Hmph. It's so that Mr. Dear won't complain!　If I had bought it with my own money, he might complain later!

<blank>

And, in case it works out, it will be a fact that "Dear Sir is a present from me to you"!　Let's see, what's the price: ......?　...... per meter?

I understand. This is a difficult one.

<blank>

I see you're selling by measure. Can I get ...... right?"

Don't underestimate me!

<blank>

As I was about to show my wallet to the clerk to have him take the fee as usual, I remembered that I had been studying "Sanzu".

Now is the time for "Sansu" as taught by Aruji-sama!　Let's see, let's see.

<blank>

Yes, I received one silver coin and four large bronze coins.

<blank>

I was able to buy it!　I was able to shop properly, Aruji-sama!

<blank>

How do you like it, Mr. Dear? I can shop too."

Yes, well done."

Don't treat me like a child, "Ehehe ......!　I'm an adult lady!

I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just thought of something else to buy.

<blank>

Totally. Oops, I'll have to explain how to use the ribbon on the way home.

............

......

<blank>

It is proper etiquette to decorate the naked figure with ribbons, as if to say, "I'm not wearing a stitch of clothing.

What?　Is that not underwear then?

That. Is that where you get shy?"

Please give it back, I'll carry it myself."

I'm a slave, but I didn't make Dia-sama carry my luggage. I'll carry your baggage, Dia-sama.

I'm fine, I can carry this much. I can't let you carry it, it's my underwear.

<blank>

Oh, it's so cute. I see why the master would keep it by his side.

But I'm wearing girls' underwear by an old man, so it's a little late for that, isn't it?

<blank>

<blank>

Then, when I returned home after shopping, I found my grandfather collapsed in the living room area.

More precisely, he is lying limp on the couch.

<blank>

"The Oracle!"

Sister!　Are you okay!"

"Uh......oh, welcome back, you two. Yeah, it's okay. ...... I'm going to go back to the dungeon after I get some rest. ...... ugh."

<blank>

And, Aruji-sama, who clearly does not seem to be okay with it.

The place we accompanied her to, deep in the dungeon, there is something that could make such a strong Anji-sama become like this. ......　The dungeon is a place to be afraid of!

<blank>

I am sorry to be so presumptuous, but I think it would be better if you took the rest of the day off. I suggest you take the rest of the day off. ......"

No, well, I'm just a little brain-damaged, so I'm fine. ......

Isn't it hard work?　The contents of your head will kill you if you spill it!　Please rest well!　Dear, I'll carry you to your room, please help me!"

Oh, yes. Yes. Can you stand up, ...... sister?"

Woo. ......."

<blank>

Then, Aruji-sama and Dia-sama supported me on both shoulders and we went to the futon in Aruji-sama's room.

kunkun......The smell of Aruji-sama is very thick in this room. It's a boiling.

<blank>

No, no, no. Aruji-sama, please get well soon. ......

<blank>
