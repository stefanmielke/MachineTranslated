# Damn it, someone like you, a good-natured person, would never abandon me!

<b>

For now, I'll return the "Wall-Breaking Hammer."

We successfully protected the artifact from Hermes, and Mi-chan gave me a kiss on the cheek saying, "Thank you, I love you!" Hehe.

<b>

Oh, they also mentioned giving us other rewards, but you know...

We're also aiming for the "Wall-Breaking Hammer," so it was hard to accept and we declined.

<b>

...No, I can't accept it! No way!

If I accept that, what kind of face should I make when I’m having fun with Mi-chan!? It would be a mess!!

<b>

"So, Dia-kun. Why did you have them make a replica?"

"I thought it would serve as a rehearsal for making another one."

<b>

When I asked Dia-kun about my doubts, that was the answer I received.

<b>

"Another one? Why?"

"I want to honestly discuss our situation and see if we can arrange to return the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer' to the gods."

"Return to the gods."

<b>

Certainly, from my perspective, it feels like delivering to the gods, but for the people in this world, it would be considered a return.

<b>

"So, if we return it, the exhibition will feel empty, right? So I thought we could display a replica instead."

"Ah, it's quite common to have replicas in exhibitions. I see."

"Is that so? Now that you mention it, there are definitely benefits to that."

"…Did you come up with that without knowing? That's amazing."

<b>

Dia-kun really is a genius, isn’t he? I’m proud of him.

<b>

"Of course, if you want to hide your identity or if the healer doesn't want to talk about connections with the gods, then that's a different story."

"Well, I think it’s fine to talk about it. I trust Mi-chan."

<b>

Besides, Mi-chan is my local partner.

Having a door connecting to the dwarven country would be convenient, so there's no reason not to say it.

<b>

"I thought you would say that. Then let's negotiate. I think it will take some time, though..."

"Well, it's not a rushed journey. Let's take our time to persuade them."

<b>

<b>

So, for that reason, I guess I'll go check on the stolen fake "Wall-Breaking Hammer."

...Oh? What do you know, the thief Hermes is already out of the country. He’s fleeing to the Pavelkanto Kingdom.

<b>

He’s really fast. It’s no wonder that in a certain game, the shoes bearing his name have a speed boost effect. I wonder what kind of magic he used? Maybe it’s a magical tool?

Well, it probably doesn’t compare to spatial magic.

<b>

<b>

...Oh, and it looks like it’s right at the handover spot. Since it’s a rare opportunity, I’ll disguise myself as the healer and crash the party. The healer hasn’t had much of a role lately anyway!

<b>

<b>

So, here we are in what looks like a slum.

I never thought a handover of an artifact would take place in a place like this.

<b>

They probably thought the same, as the healer's appearance made them all look startled.

<b>

"W-What are you? Where did you come from?"

<b>

The masked thief Hermes quietly readied his knife without raising his voice.

The recipient, a large man presumed to be a bodyguard, silently stepped in between them, hand on his sword's hilt.

<b>

...He’s probably quite well-trained. I can’t tell for sure, but that’s the feeling I get.

With those skills, he could be doing legitimate work instead of being a thief and an accomplice.

<b>

"I just thought I’d investigate who stole the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer.'"

<b>

I stated my purpose succinctly.

<b>

"Hey! I’m done with my job. If you want to negotiate, do it with that gentleman over there."

"Oh?"

<b>

With both hands raised, the thief Hermes easily sells out his client.

Meanwhile, the man referred to as "gentleman" was looking at us confidently.

Wow, he’s definitely someone important. I can feel his authority.

<b>

"Damn it... Hermes. You did bring the artifact, that's true. The reward is arranged as promised, so it’s no problem if we die here. ...From here on, we’ll handle it ourselves."

"Seriously? ...Damn it, someone like you, a good-natured person, would never abandon me!"

"You’re quite the oddball."

"Shut up! I just thought this country would be better with you around!"

<b>

Saying that, Hermes directed his hostility back at me.

The large bodyguard responded to Hermes with a cynical smile, fully intent on taking me down.

<b>

<b>

...Hey, what? It feels like I’m the bad guy here. You’re the ones who stole!
