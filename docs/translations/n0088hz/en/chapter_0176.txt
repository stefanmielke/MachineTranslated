# Damn, I can't leave a good person like you behind!

For now, the "Breaking Wall Hammer" is returned.

We successfully defended the sacred object from Hermes, and Mee-chan kissed me on the cheek with a "Thank you, I love you! and a kiss on the cheek from Mee-chan. Hehehe.

<blank>

Oh, they said they were going to give me some other rewards, you know.

We are also aiming for the "Breaking Wall Hammer," so it was difficult for us to receive it and we declined.

<blank>

...... No, they can't take it!　I can't, I can't!

If I receive it, how am I going to look like I'm having fun with Mee-chan?　I'll be like, "Oh, my God!

<blank>

So, Dear. Why did you let them make a knockoff?"

I thought it might be a good prep for having another one made."

<blank>

When I asked Mr. Deere what he had been wondering, he gave me such an answer.

<blank>

Another one?　Why?"

I would like to talk to them again about our situation, and ask them to return the "Breaking Wall Hammer" that is currently in place.

Return to God."

<blank>

Sure, from my perspective, it's like delivering a product to God, but for people in this world, it's a return.

<blank>

So I thought, "If I return it, the display will be lonely, right?　So I thought, why not display a replica?"

Ah," he said. It is quite common to put replicas in exhibitions, isn't it? I see."

Oh, I see.　Oh, if you ask me, that's a better aspect in many ways."

"You came up with that without knowing about ......?　That's amazing."

<blank>

I knew it, Dear, you're a genius, aren't you?　I'm proud of you.

<blank>

Unless, of course, your sister wants to hide her true identity or doesn't want to talk about her connection to God, even with Mr. Healer."

I think it's okay if I talk. I'll do it. I know I can trust you."

<blank>

I mean, Mee is my local wife.

A door leading from dwarven country to the base would be convenient, and I see no reason not to mention it.

<blank>

I knew your sister would say so. Then it's a negotiation. I'm sure it will take some time to get the stones. ......"

Well, it's not a rushed trip. Let's take our time to persuade him."

<blank>

<blank>

Well then, I guess I'll go check the stolen fake "Breaking Wall Hammer" for that.

...... Oh?　Hermes, the thief, is already out of the country. The thief, Hermes, is already out of the country, fleeing to the kingdom of Pavelkant.

<blank>

You are very fast. It's just like the shoes in a certain game that have the effect of running twice as fast. What kind of magic did he use?　A grimoire?

Well, it won't be as good as spatial magic.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Oh, and it looks like this is the exact spot where the handover took place. I'm going to take advantage of the opportunity and join in, disguised as Mr. Healer. I don't know, I haven't seen much of Mr. Healer lately!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

And so, it is something of a slum-like place.

You don't think that the handover of the sacred artifact would take place in a place like this.

<blank>

They must have thought so, too, because they looked perplexed when the healer showed up.

<blank>

What's up with you? Where'd you come from?"

<blank>

Hermes, the thief whose face is hidden by a mask, quietly holds up a knife without raising his voice.

The recipient, a large man who appeared to be his escort, intervened noiselessly. He has his hand on the hilt of his sword.

<blank>

...... quite well trained, maybe. I'm not sure. It feels that way.

With his skill, he could have had a decent job, but with a thief and his one hand.

<blank>

What, I thought I'd find out who stole the Breach Hammer.

<blank>

I told them so briefly of my requirements.

<blank>

I'm done with my work!　Hey, you, I've already done my job. If you want to negotiate, do it with your husband.

How?"

<blank>

Hermes the Phantom Thief, who easily sells his client with both hands.

On the other hand, the man who was called 'the husband' was looking at us proudly.

Wow, he is definitely a big guy. I can feel his dignity.

<blank>

Damn you, ...... Hermes. You have indeed brought us the sacred artifact. The reward has been arranged as promised, so it doesn't matter if we die here. ...... we will handle it from here on out on our own."

I'm not going to abandon you! ...... Damn, I can't leave a good guy like you out there!"

You're a sucker for things."

"Shut up!　I just thought this country would be better off with you guys!"

<blank>

With that, Hermes turns his hostility toward me once again.

The big man escorting me also responded to Hermes with a wry grin, ready to take me down.

<blank>

<blank>

......Ehh, what. It's like I'm the bad guy. You're the one who robbed me.
