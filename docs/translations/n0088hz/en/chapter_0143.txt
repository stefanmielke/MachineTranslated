# There’s no way a human can win against a god

"Now, with this massage skill, let's make the girls go 'ahh, ahh' and stir their sense of shame to earn some delicious socks! Yes... yes...!"

<b>

With the god's self-echo, I returned to reality.

In the end, the god is just a guy who's true to his own desires!!

<b>

Ugh, if only I had gotten a more useful skill like alchemy or something, why did I end up with massage?

<b>

...No, I mean, I could easily acquire it with the remaining SP, right?

Yeah, I could totally get it. I regret that I didn't choose that one, but it's still obtainable, and I have enough balance.

<b>

Moreover, I was re-recognizing that there really isn’t any other use for it.

At this point, wouldn’t it be better to just exchange it for skills like alchemy or swordsmanship? That’s how I feel...

<b>

<b>

In other words, it’s the god’s clever manipulation. Damn it!

There’s no way a human can win against a god, huh...!

<b>

<b>

"Ha, but well, I'm sure it's actually a rare and useful skill."

<b>

When I get back, I’ll give a massage to Dia and the others. That’s what I’ll do.

"I'm back!"

"Oh! Karina, welcome back!"

"Welcome home, Sister Karina. Thank you for your hard work."

"I'm home! Huh, is Dia maintaining the golem? I thought you said it could wait."

"I was just a bit bored, so I couldn't help it."

<b>

When I returned to the base, Mashiro was drinking alcohol in the living room, and Dia was maintaining the golem used for the portable shrine. ...Oh, he's dressed like a boy today? He looks like an androgynous mechanic girl. Cute.

<b>

"Where did you get that alcohol, Mashiro?"

"I brought it from home. There's nothing better than a drink after a bath!"

<b>

Since the quest was over, it seemed he was eager to enjoy a drink after his bath.

At that moment, Aishia placed some snacks down. It was dried meat from a crawler that had been rehydrated with water, turning it all jiggly. I guess this was also brought by Mashiro.

<b>

"Welcome back, Master. Would you like to take a bath? Or have a meal?"

"Hmm, I'm starting to get a bit hungry, so I guess a meal. It's a bit early, but let's have dinner."

<b>

I also wanted him to ask, "Or would you prefer me?"

Well, I can't choose that option in front of Dia, though!

<b>

"Would you like a meal too, Dia?"

"Yeah, it’s a good stopping point... well then."

<b>

With a bang, Dia closed the golem's hatch and came over.

He cleaned himself with 'Cleaning' and sat down on the sofa.

<b>

"By the way, Dia, are you a golem technician? You're amazing for a kid."

"It's not that difficult if you just move it. I had the manual and the magic stone."

"Our Dia is a genius. Hehe."

"That's not something Karina should be proud of. Come on, sit here. Karina, you should drink too; it's on me—Dia, you can't drink yet, you're still a kid."

"But I'm older than you..."

"You're still a kid among elves."

<b>

I sat down next to Mashiro as he invited me over.

By the way, Aishia is considered an adult by dwarf standards, so it seems she can drink.

According to Mashiro's reasoning.

<b>

"Sorry to keep you waiting. Here’s the paella."

"Oh! I've been waiting for this!"

"Wow, this is a rare dish! Give me a bit too. I'll pour you some alcohol."

"Sure, it's not particularly rare food in Verald."

"Sister, it's quite rare in Calcass."

<b>

After sharing a bit of the paella Aishia made, Mashiro poured some alcohol into my mug. Ah, bliss.

I can only be grateful to the god for this!

<b>

"You can keep working hard on delivering socks to repay the favor."

<b>

Said the voice of the god.

<b>

...Speaking of which, I left Koshori-kun in the room.

Well, it’s not like I’m doing anything that would be a problem if seen, so it’s fine.

(Next time, to the land of the dwarves.

I have a feeling I might end up saying "Ah" since the book publication work isn't on schedule...)
