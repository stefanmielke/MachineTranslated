# No man's body can defeat God

Now, use your massage skills to make the girls say "ahhh" and "ahhh" and make them feel shame and earn some tasty socks!　You can get it from ......'s ......'s ......'s ......'s ......'s ......'s!"

<blank>

With God's self-echo, I returned to reality.

After all, God is faithful to his own desires, isn't he!

<blank>

Ugh, there were more useful skills like alchemy, why did I choose massage?

<blank>

...... No, not really, you can get it with the rest of your SP to spare, right?

Yes, I can afford to acquire it. I regretted that I should have gone with this one, but it was available and I could afford the balance.

<blank>

Or rather, I was reminded that there was no other use for them in the first place.

I'm already in the mood to trade this for skills like alchemy or swordsmanship: ......

<blank>

<blank>

In other words, it is God's skillful guidance. God damn it!

I guess there is no way for a human being to defeat God. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Ha, but well, I'm sure it's actually a really rare and useful skill."

<blank>

I'll massage you and Deere when I get back, I will.

"Hello, sir."

Oooh!　Karina's back!"

I'm sure you'll be fine. Thank you for your hard work."

I'm home. Hey, Dia, are you doing maintenance on the Golem?　I told you it could wait.

I was out of time, so I just went for it."

<blank>

Back at the base, Masilo-san was having a drink in the living room and Dia-kun was doing maintenance on the golem used in the portable shrine. ...... Oh, I'm dressed like a boy today, okay?　You look like a neutral mechanic girl. Cute.

<blank>

Where did Mr. Masiello get that alcohol?

I brought it in from home. I love a good drink after a bath!"

<blank>

He wanted to enjoy a drink after his bath as soon as the request was over.

And then Isiah put down the knob. It was dried crawler meat that had been rehydrated in water to make it soft and juicy. Was this also brought in by Mashiro-san?

<blank>

Welcome back, my dear sir. Would you like a bath?　Would you like to eat?"

I'm feeling hungry too, so I'm thinking dinner. It's a little early, but it's dinner.

<blank>

And as a bonus, 'Or wa-ta-si?' I wanted him to ask.

Well, I can't choose that option in front of you, Dear!

<blank>

Would you like some rice, Miss Dia?"

Yes, it's a good time to go to ......."

<blank>

With a slam, the hatch of the golem closes and Dia-kun comes toward us.

I sat on the couch after 'washing' off the dirt.

<blank>

I mean, Dia, you're a golem technician?　That's amazing for a kid."

It wasn't that hard to just move it, I had the manual and the magic stone."

Our Dear is a genius. Hmmm."

It's not Carina's place to puff out her chest. Sit down here. Carina, have a drink, it's on me - don't drink it Dia, it's too early for a child.

So I'm older than you. ......

You're just a kid among elves.

<blank>

Mashiro invites me to sit next to him.

Incidentally, Aisia is properly judged an adult by dwarf standards, so she is allowed to drink.

According to Mr. Masiello's logic.

<blank>

Sorry to keep you waiting. Paella."

Oh, I've been waiting for you!　I've been waiting for you!"

Wow, you eat rare food!　Give me some of that too. I'll pour you some sake.

It's okay - it's not an exceptionally rare food in Velarde."

"Sister, it's quite rare in Carcassa, isn't it?"

<blank>

After sharing some of the paella that Aisia had made, Masilo-san poured some sake into our mugs. Bliss, bliss, bliss.

I can only thank God for that!

<blank>

'You can return the favor by working hard on your sock deliveries again.'

<blank>

And the voice of God.

<blank>

...... so Mr. Cossioli was left in his room.

Well, it's not like I'm going to do anything I don't want to be seen.

(Next time, to the land of dwarves.

(I have a feeling it's going to be an "aha" moment, since the book work hasn't been completed in time: ......)
