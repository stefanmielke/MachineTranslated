# Oh, Sati, you're so good at your business!

<blank>

<blank>

Wait a minute. I'll finish this side of the transaction first.

<blank>

Saying this, Satitan took out a barrel of liquor from his backpack. It looks like the honey wine he sold me as well. He is accustomed to dealing with shopkeepers by means of merchant guild certificates.

And then another barrel of sake goes into the once-flattened backpack.

<blank>

'Need a bottle of Crunchy too?　Crawler sake. It's tangy and dry."

Oh, just one then."

Two bottles of sake for 50 coppers. That's my family's price.

<blank>

Churn. Carina Shonin now has 3 silver coins and 50 copper coins left.

I said one bottle, but they made me buy two. ......　I love it!

<blank>

"Hey, Satty. You're new here, aren't you?　Go easy on her a little."

I guarantee the quality of the liquor. Besides, without a liquor license, it costs 25 coppers a bottle, so I'm not giving you anything for your money, am I?

<blank>

I heard that if you have a license and buy in bulk, you get 20 copper coins per bottle. So we can make a profit of 10 copper coins just by passing them from right to left right there on the spot. Oh my God, Sati is so good at her business!　She is so cute!

<blank>

Look, he's happy with the crunch, so we're good, right?"

Well, okay." It's a ...... freebie. Take it."

<blank>

and I was given two pieces of dried crawler meat. Wow, thank you. I'll have some as a snack.

<blank>

Leaving the store, we headed for the Adventurers' Guild.

It's to collect your allowance from your load-carrying job.

My luggage is one box of parcels. On the other hand, Satitan has plenty of letters, which are not as bulky as the fee. It's a difference in trust, isn't it?

<blank>

Satitan owns a small carriage and allowed me to take a ride in it.

Sati-tan, who is operating a carriage bird - a big bird called a carriage bird because it is a bird that pulls a carriage - on the Gosha-dai. Me sitting next to her.

<blank>

I'm just wondering why you're here, Crunchy?　Didn't you say you were going to Velarde?"

Oh, that's perfect! That's perfect!　I bought the liquor from Sati and sold it to the merchant guild for a good profit.

What did you do?　What did you do with all the profits from the merchant guild?"

<blank>

On the way to the Adventurer's Guild, I tell them about my exploits in Velarde.

However, he is a great magician without being a great magician.

<blank>

Pirates got involved," he said. Oh, and then we had a drinking contest, and I won."

......Caricatures, you're not that strong of a drinker, how did you win?"

I faked drinking to cover it up."

Oh, no!　No, you can't do that!　You have to drink properly to compare drinks. Mek!"

Ugh, I'm sorry."

<blank>

It seems that in the dwarf's view, it is a rather serious offense to foul up in a drinking contest.

Sorry. Don't pinch me.

<blank>

'Hmmm, ah, but they're against Velarde pirates, right?　That's OK then. I've only heard bad things about them.

Oh, you're sure?"

I really shouldn't have done that. But you'll forgive me because I'm a pirate and you're crunchy, won't you?"

Wow, thank you Saty-tan!"

I'm in the middle of a big party, so we'll cuddle later, okay?

<blank>

Ummm, that's so cute.

While we were talking like that, we quickly arrived at the Adventurers' Guild.

<blank>

Deposit your carriage and deliver your luggage to the Adventurer's Guild counter. Get pocket money.

Satitan also delivered a letter and received several silver coins.

<blank>

Oh, so you got something? ...... I see. Keep up the good work.

<blank>

Sati Tan talks to the receptionist and returns half of the rewarded silver coins to the counter.

<blank>

"Sati, are you looking for something?"

Hmm?　I wonder if it's information about good sake. I'm disappointed that I didn't get any information.

<blank>

It's obviously a lie. Well, if you don't want to say it, it's okay.

<blank>

'Speaking of good drinks, I had a glass of wine at Velarde's. I compared it to the pirate you mentioned earlier."

Wine. It's a specialty of the Vertokus. I think it's made from grapes. ......I see, maybe I wasn't looking for that one. ...... but the elven lands are a bit tricky to get permission to enter.

<blank>

Sigh, sighs Satitan.

Mmmm, I would like to help you with this!

<blank>

Do you need permission to enter the land of the elves?"

I guess so. If you are an adventurer, you can get in with a B rank or higher, but if you are a merchant, you have to have good contacts to get in. Especially since I'm a dwarf, it's not that easy.

I'll tell you what," he said, "I'll tell you what, ...... Saty-tan Saty-tan. Between you and me, I have an elf message for you."

Seriously?"

<blank>

Seriously. My Dia is actually an elf nobleman. I'm sure he can introduce you to one or two of his contacts.

<blank>

I've actually put together a party," he said. And one of the members is an elf."

'Hmmm. I wonder if I can get an introduction to ......?"

Hmph, that's up to Sati-tan: ......"

Okay, I'll give you a pair of socks and you can introduce me."

Okay, then!　Let's go!　We're probably at a hotel by now!"

<blank>

Hmm?　But thinking about it, aren't those socks you're wearing the ones I copied before?

If so, I can't offer it to God. ...... Well, okay.

<blank>

If a beautiful girl is in trouble, it is reasonable to help her!
