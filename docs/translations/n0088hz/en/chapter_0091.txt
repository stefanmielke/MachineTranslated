# Oh my, Sati-chan is such a good merchant!

<b>

<b>

"Just wait a moment. I need to finish this transaction first!"

<b>

Sati-chan said as she took a barrel of alcohol out of her backpack. It seems to be the honey wine she sold me. She is engaged in a familiar exchange with the shopkeeper, conducting the transaction using her merchant guild certificate.

Then, another barrel of alcohol goes into the once flattened backpack.

<b>

"Do you want a bottle of Crawlers too? It's a spicy one."

"Oh, then just one bottle."

"Two bottles for 50 copper coins. It's the family price!"

<b>

Ching! Karina Shonin's remaining balance is now 3 silver coins and 50 copper coins.

I said one bottle, but I ended up buying two...! I love it!!

<b>

"Hey Sati. This girl is a newbie, right? Go easy on her."

"I guarantee the quality of the alcohol. Besides, without a liquor license, one bottle costs 25 copper coins, so I'm not making her lose out, right?"

<b>

With a license and buying in bulk, it seems one bottle costs 20 copper coins. Just passing it from right to left at the spot nets a profit of 10 copper coins. Oh my, Sati-chan is such a good merchant! So cute!

<b>

"Look, Karikari is happy too, so there's no problem, right?"

"Well, that's fine... Here's a bonus. Take it."

<b>

I received two pieces of dried meat from Crawlers. Wow, thank you. I'll have it as a snack.

<b>

After leaving the shop, we head to the Adventurers' Guild.

It's to collect my pocket money from the delivery job.

I have one box of packages. On the other hand, Sati-chan has a lot of letters that don't take up much space compared to the fees. It's a matter of trust.

<b>

Despite her small size, Sati-chan owns a carriage, and I hitched a ride with her.

Sati-chan is driving the carriage bird—a big bird that pulls the carriage—while I sit next to her.

<b>

"By the way, why is Karikari here? Didn't you say you were going to Verald?"

"Oh, that's right! I managed to sell the alcohol I bought from Sati-chan at the merchant guild and made a nice profit!"

"Really? Making a nice profit at the merchant guild, what did you do?"

<b>

On the way to the Adventurers' Guild, I recount my exploits in Verald.

That said, I leave out my achievements as a great magician.

<b>

"There were some pirates involved. Oh, and then I had a drinking contest and won."

"…Karikari, you're not that strong with alcohol, how did you win?"

"I pretended to drink and faked it."

"Oh! That's not good! You have to drink properly in a drinking contest. No way!"

"U-uh, I'm sorry."

<b>

In Dwarven culture, cheating in a drinking contest is considered a pretty serious crime.

I'm sorry. Please don't poke at me.

<b>

"Well, but the opponent was a pirate from Verald, right? Then it's fine. I've only heard bad rumors about them."

"Oh, is that okay?"

"Actually, it's not, but since they were pirates and it's Karikari, I'll let it slide."

"Yay, thank you, Sati-chan!"

"Since I'm driving, you can hug me later."

<b>

Hehe, so cute.

As we chat like this, we quickly arrive at the Adventurers' Guild.

<b>

We drop off the carriage and deliver the packages to the Adventurers' Guild counter. Pocket money secured.

Sati-chan also delivers her letters and receives a few silver coins.

<b>

"Oh, did you get any information? ...I see. Thanks for your continued support."

<b>

After talking with the receptionist, Sati-chan returns half of her reward silver coins to the counter.

<b>

"Sati-chan, are you looking for something?"

"Hmm? Maybe information about delicious alcohol. I'm disappointed that I haven't received any information."

<b>

That's clearly a lie. Well, if she doesn't want to say, that's fine.

<b>

"Speaking of delicious alcohol, I had some wine in Verald. It was during the drinking contest with the pirates I mentioned earlier."

"Wine, huh? That's a specialty of Beltux. It's made from grapes, right? ...I see, maybe I wasn't looking for that... but you need permission to enter the Elf country."

<b>

Sati-chan sighs.

Hmm, I want to help her!

<b>

"Is it true that you need permission to enter the Elf country?"

"Yeah. Adventurers can enter if they're B rank or higher, but merchants need some connections to get in. Especially since I'm a Dwarf, it's quite difficult."

"Oh ho... Sati-chan, just between us, I have connections to the Elves."

"Really?"

<b>

Really, really. My dear Dia-kun, despite how he looks, is actually an Elven noble. I can definitely introduce one or two connections.

<b>

"Actually, I formed a party. And one of the members is an Elf."

"I see... Can you introduce me?"

"Hehe, that's up to Sati-chan..."

"Okay, I'll give you some socks, so introduce me."

"Okay! Let's go! They are probably booking a room right now!"

<b>

Hmm? But now that I think about it, the socks Sati-chan is wearing are the ones I copied before.

If that's the case, I can't offer them to the gods... well, whatever.

<b>

If a beautiful girl is in trouble, it's only right to help her!
