# Complicated home environment ......

'My goodness,...... even I couldn't peel off the curse all at once. So go to church once a week for a while. Is that okay, Misha?"

Yes, yes. ......

<blank>

Misha nods in agreement with the God doll.

...... That's because there's no curse on them from the start, and no one can remove it!

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Carina. You were a real messenger of God. ......"

Well, sort of.

And Misha, whose buttocks were bright red, and I were having tea at a cafe on good terms.

<blank>

I honestly think Misha and I could be best friends sharing this secret."

I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that, but I'd be happy to be your friend if you insist!　Well, well, if you insist, I'll be your friend?

Oh, well, okay then."

Why?　That's the part where you insist!

<blank>

I love that kind of teasing!

<blank>

Come and visit us. We'll treat you to a Dwarven brew."

I'm going to call you! ...... and maybe some ointment or something?　My ass is tingling. ......"

<blank>

Yeah, you were also freaking out when you sat in the chair at the café.

<blank>

My wife has a girl who is very good at mixing medications.

I heard you said you had five wives. Is that for real?

Yeah, I'm a Dwarf. I'm a Dwarf."

I'm going to go to a blacksmith. Can you introduce me to a good blacksmith?

I don't mind if you do, Misha. But you have to pay me."

I'm sure he'll be able to help us out!　There's a prize for being the runner-up in the Urameshiki Tournament, and if it weren't for those Five Elders, I'm sure I could get them to do it for me!"

<blank>

Oh, then maybe it's not enough.

<blank>

<blank>

And after a leisurely cup of tea at a café, when Misha's bottom had settled down, I invited her to my base.

Isiah greeted me.

I'm home. Is Lou here?　I need some ointment for my swollen buttocks."

Welcome back, my dear. If it's Mr. Lou, he's in the workshop. ...... is that Misha?"

I'm looking forward to working with you. Nice to meet you!　I'm famous now, too. You can give me your autograph.

Oh, no, thank you.

<blank>

Misha lowered his eyebrows when Isiah refused to sign his name.

<blank>

'But you don't seem surprised, Misha. About this space."

I was surprised enough at God's place earlier. Is it similar?"

<blank>

What a flexible idea. You're a good friend.

<blank>

That half-dwarf is my wife's dwarf?"

'No, he's one of my wife's grandchildren and my slave.

?　Complicated family environment, isn't it? ......"

<blank>

Yeah, I thought so too when you said it.

And I came with Misha to the Five Elder Workshop.

<blank>

I'm just wondering if you have any ointment to put on a swollen child who's been spanked? Do you have any ointment to put on a swollen buttock?"

<blank>

When I entered the workshop, all the Five Elders were there, in the middle of maintenance of Dear's gothic lolita dress.

This equipment, which is the culmination of too much of the Five Elders' technology, must be maintained.

The inside, Deere-kun, seems to be in the bath right now.

<blank>

Oh. Kari, welcome. Lou, they said ointment."

"Did he smack you on the buttocks?　Did he hit you so hard that it swelled up?"

I remember when my mom used to beat me up.

Aa-chan's mother was very strict with her. ......

Here you go. It's a good ointment for bruises and internal bleeding, Kari."

<blank>

And, as usual, while messing around, Roo-chan gave me some ointment.

<blank>

"Hi, Misha. Here you go, Misha."

Thank you very much!　Are these Karina's daughters-in-law?　None of them look old enough to have grandchildren.

<blank>

Misha looks at the five of them with a carefree "meow".

Conversely, the eyes of the five people glinted sharply for a moment.

<blank>

You fight only with your physical abilities."

I have a lot of talent, but I don't have enough of it. I'm not trained enough."

Hmmm, well, he doesn't seem like a bad kid."

"From my hips, I feel the presence of the Holy ......?"

"It's going to be good material--I'd say the overall rating is 'average'?"

<blank>

Oh, oh?"　Is it as good as it looks? ...... Uny!　What's this ointment, it works soooo good!　What? The pain in my buttocks is gone!　The swelling is gone too!

<blank>

Misha, who had been slathering himself with ointment, spins around to look at his own buttocks in surprise.

<blank>

Oh, I did it. The experiment was a success. It's a new one."

Wow, you made it? Did you make this?　You must be a famous medicine man. Thank you!　I want to know your name!

Hmm?"　Um, Barzebul Seanin ...... Kya, I said it!"

<blank>

And Roo-chan was embarrassed to introduce herself with my last name. So cute!

<blank>

I think it's the same name as the Five Elders of Tessin!　With his skill, I'm sure he can surpass the Five Elders!

Oh, it's him. Shaunin' is my trade name, isn't it?"

"...... nyaa?"

<blank>

Misha's eyes darted at my spoiler.
