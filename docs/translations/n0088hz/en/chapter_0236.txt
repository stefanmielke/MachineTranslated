# It's a complicated family environment, isn't it...

"What a surprise... I couldn't remove the curse all at once, even myself. So, for a while, you should go to the church once a week. Is that okay, Misha-san?"

"Y-yes, it is..."

<b>

Misha nods obediently to the god doll that speaks so shamelessly.

...Well, since there was no curse from the start, no one can remove it!

"...Karina. You really were a messenger of the gods, huh..."

"Well, sort of."

Misha, with her bottom all red, and I were enjoying tea together at a café.

<b>

"Honestly, I think I can become best friends with Misha since we share this secret."

"...! W-well, if you really want to be friends, I guess I can allow it!"

"Oh, then never mind."

"Why not!? That's the part where you should insist!"

<b>

I love that teasing side of her!

<b>

"Well, since we're at it, come over to my place. I'll treat you to some dwarf's ale."

"Oh, oh, well, I’ll accept your invitation! ...Also, do you have any ointment? My butt is really sore..."

<b>

Ah, she was flinching when sitting on the café chair too.

<b>

"I have a child who’s good at mixing medicine, so I'll ask her for you."

"By the way, you said you have five wives. Is that true?"

"Yeah. They're dwarves."

"Wow. Can you introduce me to a good blacksmith?"

"Sure, if it's for Misha. But make sure to pay properly."

"Of course! I have the prize money from being the runner-up in the Underworld Tournament, so I should be able to ask, unless it's against one of the Five Great Elders!"

<b>

Ah, then maybe it won't be enough.

<b>

<b>

After leisurely enjoying tea at the café, I invited Misha to my base when her bottom had calmed down.

Aisia welcomed us.

"I'm home! Is Lou-chan here? I need some ointment for my sore bottom."

"Welcome back, my lord. Lou-sama is in the workshop. ...Is that Misha-san?"

"Yep! Nice to meet you! I’ve become famous, you know. I can give you an autograph if you want."

"Oh, that's fine."

<b>

Misha's face fell when Aisia declined her request for an autograph.

<b>

"Still, Misha, you're not surprised at all about this space."

"I was surprised enough at the god earlier. This is similar, right?"

<b>

What a flexible way of thinking. You're doing great, best friend.

<b>

"Is that half-dwarf married to a dwarf?"

"No, that child is one of my wife's grandchildren and my slave."

"??? It's a complicated family environment, isn't it..."

<b>

Yeah, I thought so too as I said it.

Then, I took Misha to the workshop of the Five Great Elders.

<b>

"Lou-chan! Do you have any ointment for a child whose bottom got slapped and swollen?"

<b>

When we entered the workshop, all five Great Elders were gathered, working on maintenance for Dia-kun's Gothic Lolita dress.

This equipment, which gathers the pinnacle of the Five Great Elders' skills, requires regular maintenance.

It seems Dia-kun is currently taking a bath.

<b>

"Oh. Karichan, welcome. Lou-chan has the ointment."

"Did you say your bottom got slapped? Did you get slapped hard enough to swell up?"

"I remember getting slapped by my mom back in the day..."

"Your mom was strict, huh..."

"Here you go. This ointment works well for bruises and contusions, Karichan."

<b>

As usual, amidst the commotion, Lou-chan handed over the ointment.

<b>

"Here. Please, Misha."

"Oh, thank you! Are these girls your wives, Karina? None of them look old enough to have grandchildren, though."

<b>

Misha looks at the five of them cheerfully.

In contrast, the five of them suddenly glared sharply for a moment.

<b>

"You're fighting purely based on physical ability."

"Talent is decent, but it's being wasted. Lack of training."

"Hmm, well, she doesn't seem like a bad kid."

"I sense a holy presence from her bottom...?"

"She seems like she could be good material—overall evaluation is 'average,' I guess?"

<b>

"O-oh? Average, huh...? What is this ointment? It's working wonders!? Huh, the pain in my butt is gone!? The swelling is going down too!"

<b>

Misha, who was applying the ointment herself, spun around in surprise to check her bottom.

<b>

"Oh, yay! Experiment successful. That's a new product."

"That's amazing! Did you make it? You must be quite a renowned apothecary. Thank you! Can you tell me your name?"

"Huh? Um, it's Baaruzeburu Shounin... eek, I said it!"

<b>

Lou-chan, embarrassed by introducing herself with my last name. So cute!

<b>

"Baaruzeburu... that's the same name as Tesshin of the Five Great Elders! With those skills, you could surely surpass the Five Great Elders!"

"Oh, I'm the real deal. Shounin is my shop name."

"......Meow?"

<b>

Misha's eyes went wide at my spoiler.
