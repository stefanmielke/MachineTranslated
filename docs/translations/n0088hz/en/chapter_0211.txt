# There's nothing I can do now

<b>

That's why I realized what I had messed up...

<b>

Yeah. Just as Aisia said, there's really nothing I can do now!

The fact that I defeated the king can't be changed, and if I lose, I'll lose 82 gold coins. I have no choice but to keep advancing...!!

<b>

"Here, Menowe has given up! Karina's rampage cannot be stopped!!"

"Ugh! My magic spear Protube didn't even graze her clothes!!"

"A thrust attack with an invisible spear. Well, it might have worked if it weren't me."

<b>

Also, this outfit is a gift from all the Elders, so I can't afford to damage it or put holes in it.

<b>

However, I thought it might be bad to finish them off instantly, so I decided to fight with a bit of showmanship in mind.

I have to at least liven up the tournament... you know.

<b>

Huh? If I keep doing that, won't the king who was instantly defeated in the first match have no place to stand?

No, no, that's not it. It was just that I didn't have the luxury to hold back; they were a strong opponent. I had no choice but to finish them off before they could take me down.

<b>

<b>

Next up is the elven archer.

...I thought that if a regular arrow hits, it would definitely cause serious injury, but it seems that as long as it doesn't hit the head, potions can heal it.

Alright, let's get this match started!

<b>

"Hm? The presence of the forest... Do you have dealings with elves?"

"Yeah, I do. They're party members."

"Oh... An elf who mingles with humans. How trivial."

"Huh? If you want me to go all out, just say so, you punk."

"Ha, if you can do it, then go ahead—"

"Referee— Is weapon destruction allowed in this match?"

<b>

At that moment, for some reason, the bow that the elven guy was supposed to have was in my hands! Ah, I guess it's allowed if it's due to unavoidable circumstances in the match.

<b>

"What!? W-When did that happen!? Give it back!!"

"Well, this is just a necessary action in the match! If I give it back, I'll get taken out! So here we go! It's the breaking punishment!!"

"My beloved bow, Rebellion!?"

<b>

Ha, I snapped that bow in half. It's divine punishment for mocking my dear Dia-kun without even knowing him well.

Since I only destroyed the weapon, if the person is motivated, they can still continue. But of course, can an archer fight properly without a bow...? No way!!

<b>

"It's your fault for not having a spare bow!"

"W-My bow has always been with me, it can't be stolen!"

"Huh? You just had it taken from you by me. Complete refutation!"

<b>

So, I successfully won against the elf.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…Next is General Garou."

<b>

And so, next up is the black wolf tribe's General Garou— the opponent that Mashiro warned me to be careful of. Facing him on stage, he indeed looked like a black fluffball.

This is a nice coat. Mashiro is better, though.

<b>

Moreover, he's really intense about avenging the king.

If I'm not careful, he might try to make it look like an accident...

<b>

Well, that won't happen. My spatial magic's defense is the strongest!!

<b>

"I won't let my guard down against the power that defeated King Barbaros."

"You could let your guard down, but you're serious, huh?"

"Shut up."

<b>

After exchanging light banter, the referee signaled. Ready, fight!

<b>

"Shh!!"

"Oh, careful."

<b>

I dodged the darts. Ranged attacks right from the start. Moreover, it seems like he was expecting me to dodge, as General Garou was waiting there with his sword poised to strike.

As I dodged and tried to grab the blade to pull it, General Garou let go with both hands and kicked me. Ugh!

<b>

"Tch, you're tough."

"Well, yeah, and!"

<b>

I retaliated with ranged attacks. I pulled out the revolver from the gun holder that Elder A-chan sewed for me. Aiming for his limbs, since a headshot could mean instant death.

<b>

Bang bang bang!! My dual pistols fired. General Garou dodged, but he was instead aiming to strike me right after I shot.

<b>

"Even if it's two shots at once, it won't hit! Take this—"

"—Do you know about ricochet?"

<b>

In the next moment, a bullet gouged into General Garou's calf from behind.

<b>

"Ugh!? Y-You adjusted the bullet's bounce, didn't you!?"

"Don't worry. I don't intend to take your life."

<b>

I don't say how I did it, but of course, I just changed the trajectory with spatial magic.

I used magic, but in a way, it was still a ricochet, so I'm not lying!
