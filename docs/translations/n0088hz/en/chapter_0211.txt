# I can't help you now.

<blank>

That's how I realized I had done it. ......

<blank>

Yup. Isiah is right, there's certainly nothing we can do about it now!

I can't change the fact that I beat the king, and if I lose, my 82 gold coins are gone. I have no choice but to go on winning ......!

<blank>

Menoue gave up at this point!　Kalina is on a roll!

"Damn!　I can't believe my magic spear protube didn't even graze my clothes!"

A stab attack with an invisible spear. Well, it might have worked if it weren't for me."

<blank>

Also, these clothes are a gift from all the Five Elders, so I can't damage them or make holes in them.

<blank>

However, I thought it would be bad if I killed them off instantly, so I decided to fight with a little bit of an eye to attracting them.

We should at least make the convention more exciting. ......

<blank>

Huh?　If you do it like that, there's no room for the king who was killed instantly in the first round?

No, no, no, that one was that one. He was a strong opponent who just couldn't afford to go easy on you. He was the one who had to decide before he got hit on the first move.

<blank>

<blank>

And next is the elven bowman.

...... I thought that if a bow and arrow normally hit you, you would inevitably get seriously injured.　I thought so, but I heard that it's OK if you don't get hit on the head because it can be healed with a potion.

Now, let the games begin!

<blank>

Mhm?"　A sign of the forest...... you have a relationship with the elves?"

Yes, I do. You're a party member."

"Well, ......, you're an elf who gets along with the humans. That's a pretty smart thing to do."

What?　If you want me to be serious, just say so, Teme."

"Well, I'll see what I can do.

"Referee. Is it allowed to destroy weapons?

<blank>

At that moment, I somehow had in my hand a bow that should have belonged to the elf guy!　Oh, and if it was force majeure or something in the match, it was ants.

<blank>

What?　When did this happen?　Give it back!

No, I had no choice in the match!　If I give it back, I'll be beaten!　That's why!　I'm going to get my ass kicked!

My beloved bow Rebellion!

<blank>

I broke his bow. I'll be damned if I'm going to make fun of you without knowing you well enough to know my Dear.

Since he just destroyed the weapon, he can still continue if he is willing to do so. But of course, there is no way a bowman can get into a proper fight without a bow. ......!

<blank>

It's worse if you don't have a spare bow!"

My bow has always been with me, it cannot be stolen.

What?　You were just robbed by me. You just took it from me.

<blank>

So, we have successfully won the elves, too!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

......General Garrow is next."

<blank>

And so, the next one was finally General Garou of the Black Wolf Tribe - the opponent that Mr. Masilo had told me to watch out for. When we confronted him on stage, he was indeed a black mofo.

This is a nice furrow. Masilo's is better though.

<blank>

And already. They're so eager to avenge the king that they're willing to kill.

If it's bad, it could be made to look like an accident, like .......

<blank>

Well, they won't. Because my spatial magic defense is the strongest!

<blank>

The power that defeated King Barbaros has kept us on our toes from the start."

You could have, but you're so serious."

"Fuck you."

<blank>

And after a light conversation, the referee signals. Reedie, whew!

<blank>

Shh!

Oops."

<blank>

I avoided the dart. A flying dart from the very first move. Moreover, it seemed that I was supposed to avoid it, and then General Garou came poking at me with his sword as if he was waiting for me.

I avoided this and tried to pick up the blade and pull it away, but General Garou quickly let go of my hands and kicked me. Hmph!

<blank>

"Tsk, that's hard."

Well, you know!"

<blank>

This one too is fighting back with flying weapons. They pull out a revolver from the gun holder that A-chan, the Five Elders, sewed up for them. With two-handed pistols, I aim at the hands and feet. A head wound could kill you instantly.

<blank>

Bugbugn!　and my two pistols opened fire. General Garou sees through it and avoids it. Rather, he conversely aimed at the gap right after the shot and slashed at me.

<blank>

Two bullets at the same time won't hit you!　Take that!

You know what a ricochet is?

<blank>

The next moment, a bullet gouged through General Garou's calf from behind.

<blank>

"Noooooo!　Don't tell me you adjusted the bullet's ricochet?

I'm not going to take your life. I'm not going to take your life."

<blank>

I'm not going to tell you the answer, style, but of course I just used spatial magic to change the trajectory.

I used magic, but in a way it was a ricochet, so I'm not lying!
