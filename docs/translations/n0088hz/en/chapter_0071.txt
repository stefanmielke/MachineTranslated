# It's too bad for education in many ways!　illustrations

<blank>

When Dear-kun's rank reached E, I decided once again to leave Dear-kun in the hands of Braid-senpai.

<blank>

Dia, I'm going to go finish my business meeting. I'm going to go finish my business meeting, and while I'm gone, you can teach Braid what it means to be an adventurer. He is a good man who will teach you a lot of things if you drink with him, I assure you.

"Hey, hey, hey, Karina, you want us to babysit?"

Master, bring sake and snacks for the seniors. I'll leave some money for Dia-kun's meal.

We'll take good care of you, Karina. We'll take good care of you."

<blank>

I like it because it's fast-paced.

<blank>

Nice to meet you, Dear.

Yo, nice to meet you. Mr. Braid."

Be careful not to mess with Mr. Deere.

I ain't gonna touch your girl. ...... Or was it a guy? Either way, I'm not going to."

<blank>

I hope so. I leave the Adventurers' Guild.

And the destination - of course - is the Shunrai Pavilion, where the lotion was delivered!

<blank>

Sorry Dia, the Shun Lai Pavilion we are about to visit is too bad for all kinds of education!

It's an adult restaurant!

Maybe I'll accidentally go home in the morning, but I'm sure my seniors will take care of it!

<blank>

I came to Shunrai Pavilion with such light footsteps.

The sun is still high in the sky and the store has not yet opened, but I am here to deliver lotions. I call out from the kitchen door at the back of the building, "Kon-kon-kon", "Sumimasen".

<blank>

Oh. "Oh, Karina. You're back safe and sound."

I've been back for a long time, and I've stocked up on lotion!　It's been a while, I'm back properly and I've stocked up on lotions!"

Oh, I see. Well, come in. I can't offer you alcohol, but I can at least give you a cup of tea.

<blank>

Hehe, he still has a nice face. Good personality too. And boobs and legs.

I follow behind Sister Harumikazuchi into the store. The glossy fox tail wagging in front of me is too tempting. I want to suck it. But I'm sure she'll get mad at me, so I'll hold back. ......

<blank>

"Come on, let me see. It's not shoddy, is it?"

Here you go.

<blank>

I took out 33 bags of lotion. The table was full.

<blank>

<blank>

I know I told you to stock up on ......, but did you buy this much?"

I thought the more the merrier."

I didn't say how many," he said. Which is what's inside: ...... hmm."

<blank>

The sister lightly wet her fingers with spit, then dipped them in the lotion powder and licked them flippantly.

Hmmm...and I'm examining it. I'm so nervous.

<blank>

"Very classy. ...... A bag of these for a silver coin isn't going to make you a lot of money, is it?"

Well, it's almost the same price as the purchase price. "Well, it's about the same as the purchase price, but I negotiate a little extra to make a profit.

<blank>

In other words, there would normally be a huge loss in transportation and labor costs.

<blank>

I said, "......, you're not a good merchant, are you?　I said I was hoping you would buy a couple of bags while you were at it. I said, "I was just thinking that you could buy a couple of bags while you're at it.

'Oh no, it's your sister's request and I wanted to do my best to fulfill it!

What a helpless child."

<blank>

Oh dear," shrugs Sister Harumikazuchi.

<blank>

"......I'm willing to be stingy with the quantity on this one, so I'll give you three bags for four silver coins, for a total purchase of 44 ...... silver coins in all, for a crisp 45."

"Oh, you don't mind?　Wow, sister, you're so fat!"

"Aah!　My toned stomach is fat?

Excuse me!"

<blank>

I apologized with the force of getting down on my knees. I didn't have a thick stomach for women, yes.

<blank>

But are you sure?　Forty-five silver coins?

What? Don't worry about it. If we give out some to the stores around us, we'll get our money's worth."

Wow, so that's how it is."

Look, let's get this deal done before I change my mind."

<blank>

Use the merchant guild certificate to exchange money. The delivery is now complete.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, yes. Sister, I made something like this."

"Hmm?　What's with the curious balled stick?"

<blank>

I took out my massage device. It was a very healthy one.

This is the one that Dear helped me make.

It is a totally non-erotic one, but I am convinced it should be in this store.

<blank>

"The way I use this stick is, ...... here is the switch, and it shakes, so ......"

Hmmm? ...... Wow, it's a magical tool that makes you tremble. It's called a "demonma," and it surely works on the shoulders. It's rather good for my shoulders, since they get stiff when my chest is heavy.

By the way, you can apply it to something other than your shoulder. For example, ......"

......"?　Wait a minute. You can't just ...... do that!　Doesn't it hurt?"

Do you want to try it?　Oh, we also have a smaller version of this, well, we only have a few prototypes so far. ......"

<blank>

After making an enthusiastic appeal to the sister based on the demonstration, she purchased one set of prototypes for five silver coins. I'm going to make it with the materials I bought and sell it.
