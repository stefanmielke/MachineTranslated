Now that Dia-kun's rank has dropped to E, I've decided to leave him in the care of Blade-senpai once again.

<b>

“Dia-kun. I’m going to take care of some business, so in the meantime, learn what it means to be an adventurer from Blade-senpai. He’s a good senpai who will teach you a lot if you pour him a drink, I guarantee it.”

“Hey, hey Karina, are you telling us to babysit him?”

“Hey Master, drinks and snacks for the seniors, please. Oh, and I’ll leave some money for Dia-kun’s meals too.”

“Leave it to me, Karina. We’ll take good care of him.”

<b>

I like how quick the conversation is.

<b>

“Nice to meet you, Dia.”

“Y-yes, nice to meet you, Blade-san.”

“Oh, be careful not to touch Dia-kun, or else it’ll be scary afterward.”

“I don’t touch other people’s women… no, is he a man? Either way, I won’t touch him.”

<b>

That’s good to hear. I leave the Adventurer's Guild.

And my destination is—of course, the lotion delivery location, Shunrai-tei!

<b>

Sorry, Dia-kun, but Shunrai-tei is way too bad for education!!

It’s an adult shop!!

I might accidentally end up coming back in the morning, but I’m sure I can leave it to my seniors!!

<b>

With such light steps, I arrive at Shunrai-tei.

Since it’s still early in the day, it’s not open yet, but I came to deliver the lotion. I knock on the back door and call out, “Excuse me!”

<b>

“Oh, Karina. It’s you, you made it back safely.”

“Harumikazuchi-onee-sama! Long time no see, I’ve returned safely and brought the lotion!”

“Oh, is that so? Well, come in. I can’t serve you alcohol, but I can let you have some tea.”

<b>

Hehe, still as beautiful as ever. Great personality too. And those breasts and legs.

I follow Harumikazuchi-onee-sama into the store. The swaying, colorful fox tail in front of me is far too tempting. I want to fluff it, to suck it. But I’ll get scolded, so I’ll hold back…!

<b>

“Now, let me see. You didn’t bring any inferior products, did you?”

“Here you go.”

<b>

I took out 33 bags of lotion. The table was filled.

<b>

“...I did ask you to get some, but did you really buy this much?”

“I thought it would be better to have more.”

“True, I didn’t specify a limit, but... Let’s see, what’s inside... hmm.”

<b>

Onee-sama lightly moistened her finger with saliva, dipped it in the lotion powder, and licked it.

Hmm, hmm, she seems to be savoring it. I’m so nervous.

<b>

“It’s top quality… but selling this for one silver coin per bag won’t be profitable, will it?”

“Well, it’s almost the same as the purchase price. I negotiated a bit and got a small discount, so that’s my profit.”

<b>

In fact, normally, the transportation costs and labor would result in a huge loss.

<b>

“...Are you sure you’re cut out to be a merchant? I thought you’d just bring back two or three bags as a side task. Usually, you’d mix in some fillers to bulk it up, right?”

“No, since it was your request, Onee-sama, I wanted to respond with my best effort!”

“Goodness, you’re such a troublesome child.”

<b>

Harumikazuchi-onee-sama shrugs her shoulders in exasperation.

<b>

“...In that case, I can afford to be stingy with the quantity, so for three bags, it’ll be four silver coins, totaling 44 silver coins... I’ll make it an even 45 silver coins for the purchase.”

“Eh, is that okay? Yay, Onee-sama is so generous!”

“Ah? Are you saying my toned stomach is fat!?”

“I’m sorry!”

<b>

I apologized with the intensity of a dogeza. There’s no such thing as a generous woman, huh.

<b>

“But are you really okay with this? 45 silver coins is quite a lot.”

“Don’t worry about it. If I distribute some to the surrounding shops, I can still break even.”

“Wow, so that’s how it works.”

“Now, let’s finish the transaction before I change my mind.”

<b>

Using my Merchant Guild certificate, I exchanged the money. With that, the delivery is complete.

<b>

<b>

“Oh, by the way. Onee-sama, I made something like this.”

“Hmm? What’s that strange stick with a ball?”

<b>

I took out a massage device. It’s completely wholesome.

It’s something I had Dia-kun help me make.

It’s not erotic at all, but I’m convinced it belongs in this store.

<b>

“The way to use this stick is… this is the switch, and it vibrates…”

“Hmm, hmm?… Oh, a vibrating magical tool. Is it called a denma? It certainly works well for the shoulders. When your chest is heavy, it gets tense, so it’s quite effective.”

“By the way, you can use it on other areas too. For example…”

“...Huh? W-wait a minute. You’re not suggesting to use it there…!? I-isn’t that painful?”

“Want to give it a try? Oh, there’s also a smaller version of this, but I only have a few prototypes right now…”

<b>

After demonstrating, I passionately appealed to Onee-sama, and she ended up purchasing a set of prototypes for five silver coins. Yes! Now I can properly make and sell items with the materials I acquired.
