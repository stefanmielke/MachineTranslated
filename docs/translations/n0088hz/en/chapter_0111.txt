# There was a big beehive there.

My name is Karina!　I'm in the mood for a certain game and I'm going through a dungeon!

Oh, a big spider this time. It's still bigger than a human, and I wonder if this is another one. A chance to say that line about being wrapped up in a string...

<blank>

He attacked me in a normal way. What the hell, you got me hoping."

<blank>

If I had to guess, I would say that it was like trying to catch them by attaching a string to their paw?　It was like using a string attached to the paw like a cat's cradle and trying to catch it by sticking to it. Hmmm, go ahead and fly the string. If you want, go fly a spider web like your friend's character in a certain gorilla game.

<blank>

What?　You say it's impossible to fly a spider as a web because it's just a thread when it comes out of the spider's buttocks?　Shut up and do something with magic!　You're a demon! ...... No, you can't do it with magic. It was more reckless than asking the spider to spit out chewing gum in the shape of a spider web in its mouth.

<blank>

Well, the spiders can be dismantled and put into storage.

Oops, sign of adventurers. Let's avoid this one and look for another way. It would be troublesome if we run into each other.

As a spatial wizard, I have a perfect grasp of the pathways I've come to. The map in my brain is perfect in 3D. If I want to go back, I can, and if I want, I can just ignore the strategy and go back to the storage space.

Let's avoid signs of people and proceed at a reasonable pace.

Oops, it's Crowler. You were surprisingly tasty... Oh, the Yellow Hornet is attacking me. What, you're food in the dungeon too? Sadly, it's called the food chain. ...... and I had a good idea. Let's hide and follow the Yellow Hornet. Optical camouflage!　I decided to hide and follow the Yellow Hornet that was attacking Crowler.

<blank>

If they are willing, they might be able to take us to the Mother or Queen, who is said to be deep in the dungeon!

<blank>

So we wait quietly as Mr. Yellow eats and gruesomely dumplings the leftovers. ...... Okay, he has taken off. Let's start following him.

Hmm?　Hey there, red praying mantis. That Yellow Hornet is mine, and you're not allowed to hit it sideways.

That's totally dangerous. Let's leave Mr. Yellow invincible. The red praying mantis will be dismantled and sent to storage. And then toss it. You may have just been trying to eat a passing snack, but you're out of luck.

So, after escorting Mr. Yellow out of the shadows, we reached the descending staircase.

The room in front of me looks like a boss room, but there is no boss and no door. Could this be an unexplored area?　Maybe this is the reason why there are roaming bosses and so on. I'll give it some thought.

Well, that's okay. Let's go to the back.

<blank>

<blank>

I followed Mr. Yellow further and found a huge beehive.

A wasp-type nest shaped like an incoming cloud. They were buried as if they were spreading all over the hall, which had been knocked out of the second and third floors. And a large number of Hornets were flying around.

<blank>

Wow, I get goosebumps just looking at it. I get goosebumps just looking at it. This is physiologically disgusting. Humans are made to hate bees. I'm going to get agglutinophobia!

There's yellow and red, and orange in between. Wow, that's disgusting. It's like a bug, a bug, a bug, a little mosaic. I want a mosaic over my entire field of vision!　I can't show you!

<blank>

...... Anyway, now that we've made it this far, Mr. Yellow is no longer of any use. I released my invincible state and sent Mr. Yellow off to carry the crawler dumplings into the nest. Thanks for guiding us.

<blank>

<blank>

I was like, "...... hmmm, I wonder if this is one that can be eradicated. I don't know."

<blank>

For now, let's use spatial magic to check the structure of this room. ...... and the moment I released the magic like active sonar, all the Hornets in the room turned to me at once.

<blank>

<blank>

Stop?　Kochiminai desu?

<blank>

<blank>

I was wondering whether I should say so or not when the bees pounced on me.

<blank>

'Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　Help me eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

Wait, how can you listen to me and listen to ......, you bee?

If they made noise, of course, the bees attacked, even from inside the hive.

Wow!　I'm scared!　Gross!　It doesn't do any damage, but don't get too close, seriously, it's a big bug!　Oh no!

<blank>

I found myself killing every single bee in the room.

...... I can't help it!　Oh, I was almost a little traumatized: ......
