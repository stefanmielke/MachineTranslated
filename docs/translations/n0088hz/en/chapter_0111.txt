# There was a big beehive there.

I'm Karina-chan! Right now, I'm progressing through a dungeon in the mood of a certain game!

Oh, this time it's a big spider. It's larger than a human, could this be that thing? The chance to say that line about being wrapped in thread and so on――

<b>

"Wait, it just attacked me normally. What the heck, you got my hopes up."

<b>

If I had to say, it was trying to use its forelegs to stick threads like in a cat's cradle, attempting to catch me with its sticky web. Hmm, come on, shoot your thread. You could at least shoot webs like that friend character from a certain gorilla game.

<b>

What? You say that since the thread comes out of the spider's rear, it's impossible to shoot it as a web? Shut up and use magic to figure it out! It's a monster, right!?... No, that might be too much. Asking it to spit out chewed gum in the shape of a web was probably unreasonable.

<b>

Well, I'll just dismantle the spider and toss it into storage.

<b>

<b>

Oh, a presence of an adventurer. I'll avoid this and look for another path. It's troublesome to run into them anyway.

As a spatial magic user, I have a complete grasp of the passage I came from. My mental map is perfect in 3D. If I want to go back, I can, and I can just return to the storage space, ignoring the攻略.

Let's just move forward while avoiding human presence.

<b>

<b>

Oh, a crawler. You were surprisingly tasty―― ah, you're being attacked by a yellow hornet. What the heck, are you food even in the dungeon? It's sad, but this is what they call the food chain... Oh, I just thought of a good idea. I'll hide and follow the yellow hornet. Optical camouflage! I decided to follow the yellow hornet that was attacking the crawler while hiding my presence.

<b>

If I'm lucky, it might lead me to the mother or queen that's said to be deeper in the dungeon!

<b>

So, I quietly waited while the yellow hornet was eating and mashing up leftovers into a ball. ...Alright, it took off. Time to start following.

Huh? Hey, wait, you red mantis over there. That yellow hornet is my prey, no side attacks allowed.

Seriously, how dangerous. I'll put the yellow hornet in invincible mode. The red mantis will be disassembled and sent to storage. Tossed away. You might have just been trying to eat a passing snack, but you had bad luck.

<b>

<b>

So, after secretly escorting the yellow hornet, we arrived at a downward staircase.

The front seems like a boss room, but there's no boss and no door. Is this an unexplored area? Maybe this is why wandering bosses appear. Just a thought.

Well, whatever. Let's go deeper.

<b>

<b>

Following the yellow hornet further, there was a big beehive.

A hornet-type nest shaped like a cumulonimbus cloud. It filled the large hall that pierced through two or three floors. And a large number of hornets were flying around.

<b>

Whoa, just looking at it gives me goosebumps. It's making me itch. This is physiologically unacceptable. Humanity is made to detest bees. I'm going to develop a fear of clusters!

There are yellow, red, and even some orange ones in between. Ugh, gross. It's all insecty and feels like bugs, I need a mosaic. I want a mosaic over my entire field of vision! I can't look at this!

<b>

...Anyway, now that I'm here, the yellow hornet is no longer needed. I released its invincibility state and watched as it carried the crawler ball into the nest. Thanks for the guidance.

<b>

<b>

"......Hmm, I wonder if it's okay to exterminate these. I can't tell."

<b>

For now, let's check the structure of this room with spatial magic... and the moment I released my magical power like an active sonar, all the hornets in the room turned to face me at once.

<b>

<b>

Stop it? Don't look over here?

<b>

<b>

Just as I was contemplating saying that, the bees suddenly lunged at me.

<b>

"Whoa, this is so gross!!! Help meeeeee!!!"

<b>

Wait, listen to my side of the story... but I guess bees can't listen!

Naturally, as I made a commotion, bees from inside the nest also attacked me.

Yikes! This is terrifying! Gross! It doesn't deal damage, but seriously, don't come near me, you're a giant bug! Nooo!!

<b>

Before I knew it, I had killed every single bee in the room, leaving not one behind.

...It can't be helped!! Ah, I almost developed a trauma from that...
