# Got it!

<blank>

Yohki, who had been sitting on his back, returns and sees the black dragon, tamed like a dog by Dia-kun.

<blank>

"......, are they the ones that are safe to touch?"

Don't touch me without permission!　Don't touch me without permission, human being!　Go get permission from Miss and come back!

Pie!

<blank>

I tried to touch it, it barked at me, and I sat back down again. What a cute little devil.

<blank>

Oh, it looks like the only one the dragon is letting loose with is the princess."

'Huh?　No, Miss says so. ...... Oh, so that's what you're doing. I understand!

<blank>

Kirigon smiles, showing his fangs with a grin. The demon tribe flinched at the vicious smile.

Deer-kun is used to it with Arthur, so he strokes it as it is without any particular concern.

<blank>

I am Arthur, and you are Arthur. I'm Arthur. My original name is (untranslatable).

'...... yes brother. I'm (untranslatable), but I'm Kirigon now. ...... So, who is Miss...?"

 Also, Dia-kun, whom I am petting right now, is an ordinary elf, but he is favored by Miss Dia, and if he gets even a scratch on him, he will be killed.

...... Thank you for your advice.

<blank>

By the way, no vocabulary books were used in this conversation, and you're not getting through to anyone but the dragon and me.

<blank>

And I have a cat-and-beastman with me now, but it's OK to treat him a little roughly. The demons can be handled as they please, as long as you don't kill them. In some cases, you may even kill them.

I don't understand the fine distinctions between humans.

I was like, 'Well, I don't need to know anyone but you and Dia-kun. The rest of you can beat them up if they get cocky.

I've got it!"

<blank>

The people of the demon tribe are watching from afar in awe as the dragons converse with each other.

<blank>

'Princess, isn't it about time you asked the dragon about sacrifices?

Huh?"　Uh, yes. ...... Well, Mr. Dragon. What does sacrifice look like?"

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to answer that question in the usual way.　We didn't make any demands.

Hmm?"　Yes, Princess. Hmmm... Hmmm... Oh dear!　I don't remember the dragon demanding a sacrifice!"

I'm sure you're not the kind of person who likes to say, "Oh, I don't know what to say about this, Miss.

<blank>

That's because Kirigon's words are only understood by me and Mr. Arthur.

I tell them about the dragon situation in the form of what I have heard from Mr. Dear.

<blank>

I hear you haven't requested any sacrifices in the last dozen years. I hear they haven't even eaten a human being. What does this mean?"

What?　That's absurd. Then where the hell did my sister go?

<blank>

One of the wenches of the demon tribe voiced this. My sister must have been offered as a sacrifice.

<blank>

What do you mean, Miss?　I'm so annoyed that I'm forced to do something I didn't do. It's like a lowly creature. ......!

"Eh, Princess, what a ...... way the dragon is, ho, ho!　That I have seen men taking women in the woods!"

No such ......!"

He said, "I'm going to the village now, and he wants all of you to show up!　He says he will talk to them after that!　Well, if that's what the dragon says, then we have no choice!"

'Ah, yes. Please feel free to use me. I'll just make the right noise. Yes.

<blank>

I mean, I already told you how the farce was going to go. You are a silly dragon, you know that?

<blank>

Then let's go on that dragon, Princess. Let the princess ride.

Ouch. Ouch.'

<blank>

I kick my legs lightly and Kirigon lowers his head to facilitate the ride.

<blank>

"...... something sorry, Mr. Dragon."

No, I'm absolutely obedient to her. I'm absolutely obedient to you. Don't worry about it.

<blank>

Dia-kun doesn't understand the language of dragons, but he seemed to be able to communicate with Dia-kun and Kirigon.
