# Got it!

<b>

Yoki-chan, who had been paralyzed with fear, returns and sees the black dragon being tamed like a dog by Dia-kun.

<b>

“...Huh, is it okay to touch it?”

“Grrraaah!! Don’t touch me without permission, human!! Go get permission from the lady and come back!!”

“Pee!?”

<b>

I tried to touch it and got barked at, causing me to freeze in fear again. What a cute little demon.

<b>

“Oh, it seems that the dragon only trusts the princess.”

“Eh? No, it’s because the lady said so... Ah, so that’s how it is. Got it!”

<b>

Kirishon shows its fangs and smiles. The demon tribe flinches at the ferocious grin.

Dia-kun, accustomed to Arthur, continues to pet it without concern.

<b>

“Yeah, we’re both having a tough time, brother. By the way, I’m Arthur. My original name is (untranslatable), though.”

“...Yeah, brother. I’m (untranslatable), but right now I’m Kirishon... So, who is this lady?”

“She claims to be a human, but there’s no doubt she’s a higher being than dragons. Also, the Dia-kun you’re petting is an ordinary elf, but since he’s under the lady’s favor, if you even scratch him, you’ll be killed.”

“...I’ll gratefully accept your advice.”

<b>

By the way, this conversation isn’t being conveyed to anyone other than the dragon and me, without even a vocabulary list.

<b>

“Oh, and right now there’s a cat beastman accompanying us, but you can treat them a bit roughly. Just don’t kill the demon tribe, that’s fine. In some cases, it’s okay to kill them.”

“I can’t distinguish the humans’ fine differences.”

“For now, as long as the lady and Dia-kun understand, that’s enough. If they’re cheeky, you can just beat them up.”

“Got it!”

<b>

The demon tribe watches in awe from a distance as the dragons converse.

<b>

“Princess, how about asking the dragon about the sacrifices soon?”

“Eh? Ah, yes. ...Um, dragon-san, what’s the deal with the sacrifices?”

“Uh, can I just answer this normally? We don’t have any particular demands.”

“Hmm? Yes, princess. Hmm, hmm. What!? The dragon claims to have no memory of demanding sacrifices!?”

“Ah, so it’s okay to say whatever about this, huh, lady?”

<b>

Of course, only Arthur and I can understand Kirishon’s words.

I speak about the dragon’s circumstances as if I heard it from Dia-kun.

<b>

“Hmm, hmm, it seems that for the past ten years or so, there have been no demands for sacrifices. They haven’t eaten humans either. What does this mean?”

“Eh!? That can’t be! Then where on earth did my sister go!?”

<b>

One of the demon tribe’s maids raised her voice like that. It seems her sister was offered as a sacrifice.

<b>

“What does this mean, lady? I can’t stand being blamed for something I didn’t do. It’s infuriating for a lowly creature like me...!”

“Eh, princess, the dragon says... oh, oh! They’ve seen men taking women into the forest!”

“That’s...!”

“They’re saying that we should all show our faces when we go to the village! They say the talk will be after that! Well, if the dragon says so, there’s no helping it!”

“Ah, yes. Please feel free to use me, lady. I’ll just make some noise randomly.”

<b>

I mean, I already mentioned the flow of the farce earlier, right? This foolish dragon must have forgotten while being petted by Dia-kun.

<b>

“Then let’s have the princess ride on that dragon. Come on, let’s go, princess.”

“Ouch. Got it.”

<b>

As I lightly kicked its foot, Kirishon lowered its head to make it easier to ride.

<b>

“...I’m sorry about this, dragon-san.”

“No problem. I’m absolutely obedient to the lady. Don’t worry about it.”

<b>

Dia-kun shouldn’t understand the dragon’s words, but it seemed like he was somehow connecting with both Dia-kun and Kirishon.
