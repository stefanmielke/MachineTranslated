# A Little Crackle

<b>

……By the way, it's the Mobile Turtle Knight Corps, huh? Wait, is it called Dodai Turtle? It's literally a moving platform. Wow, I didn't know something like this existed.

<b>

Anyway, since I was asked a question, I guess I'll answer it.

And I'll also hide this somehow endearing dragon.

<b>

"Uh, well. This guy is my pet, is there a problem?"

"Yes! I'm a pet! Grrr, meow!"

"A, a dragon as a pet!? N-no, they say that a dragon raised carefully from an egg can become attached to people. Looking at how attached it is, it doesn't seem like a lie."

<b>

Oh. This guy has no dignity. It really is acting like a cat, clinging to me.

Hey, reptile, your cold scales are tickling me. And it's crackling a bit. By the way, you are a Thunder Dragon, aren't you?

<b>

The armored dwarf standing like a guardian on the turtle continues to talk to me while still being somewhat wary.

<b>

"Actually, there's information about a dragon that killed people around here. That dragon seems calm, but it matches the eyewitness reports."

"Oh. Speaking of which, I just punched a stray-looking dragon earlier. It attacked me, probably because it was in heat. Look, this is the fang it dropped."

<b>

With that, I show the fang of that dragon that I secretly duplicated earlier.

Huh? Dragon fangs are rare materials. Of course, I decided to duplicate it just in case.

<b>

"Mu!? Th-this is definitely a Thunder Dragon's fang!"

"It seems like it regained its sanity after being punched."

"You punched it!? A dragon!?"

"Yeah, well. I was surprised when the guy with the iguana car said it was a dragon. Oh, it ran away. Yeah, whoosh. Was it that way? I couldn't see it?"

<b>

I'm not lying; I omitted the subject, but it was the iguana car that ran away, not the dragon. Yeah. A bit hard to understand? Sorry, I'm not good at my native language. I'm not from this world.

<b>

"I didn't see it, but this fang is certainly evidence that there were other dragons besides that one. I apologize for my suspicion. If you don't mind, could you provide that evidence? Of course, I'll pay a sufficient amount."

"If you're going to buy it—ah, no. Please, take it."

<b>

I was going to sell it, but then I remembered this was a duplicate and stopped myself.

I decided not to sell duplicates, so I can't sell this.

Since I have no choice, I'll give it away for free as a kind-hearted ordinary person.

<b>

"…Is that okay?"

"Yes, if you want, I can also take it from my pet."

"Gi-gya!? Sis!?"

"O-oh. …Just a little, okay?"

<b>

It's fine, I'll heal it after I take it… I can actually copy it without taking it!

And then, firmly facing me,

<b>

"I appreciate the valuable evidence provided. May I ask your name?"

"I'm Karina, the traveling merchant. …Ah! The one who punched the dragon is a healer! They're in that car over there! But they're a bit difficult, so it's better not to meet them!"

<b>

Oh no, I accidentally introduced myself just like that.

It's the healer who did something outrageous, not the universe's most beautiful girl, Karina-chan.

<b>

"…Understood. We will check whether the threat of the dragon has been eliminated. If you're heading to Rosetta, could you deliver a letter? I'll pay for the delivery."

"Um. Rosetta, ah, yes, Rosetta. If you go straight along this road..."

"Ah. Just hand it to the gatekeeper."

<b>

Oh, I thought it was the name of a town from the flow of the conversation, but it seems I was right. I'm glad.

Phew, I'll ask Aisia about the place names later.

<b>

"Sis, please also mention the one who spiked my drink with aphrodisiac. If I'm blamed for the dragon's fault because of my own actions, I'll get scolded by the Dragon King."

<b>

…I guess I have no choice. But since Karina-chan is caring, I'll listen to this much.
