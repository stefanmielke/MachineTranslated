# I'll crack on a bit.

I see that ...... is the Knights of the Mobile Turtle. Oh, it's called Dodai Turtle?　It's a moving foundation. Wow, there is such a thing?

<blank>

Anyway, if you asked me a question, I will answer it.

In addition, I would like to hide this somewhat hateful dragon as well.

<blank>

Uh-huh. Uh, this guy is my pet, what's up?"

Yes, I'm a pet!　It's a pet!　Rumble, rumble, rattle, rattle, rattle!

A dragon is a pet?　No, it is said that if a dragon is raised from an egg with care, it will be friendly to people. But judging from the way they are so friendly, it seems that they are not lying.

<blank>

Oh. Doesn't this guy have any dignity? He really spoils me like a cat.

Hey reptile, your cold scales are getting cold. And a little crackle. Well, you're the Thunder Dragon, aren't you?

<blank>

The armed dwarf standing nioh to the turtle continues to talk with me, still somewhat alarmed.

<blank>

There are reports of a dragon that has been killing people around here," he said. The dragon seems to be docile, but it matches the sightings.

Oh. Speaking of which, I punched a stray-looking dragon a while ago. It was in heat and attacked me. Here are the fangs it dropped.

<blank>

And I show him the fangs of this guy I had secretly duplicated earlier.

Huh?　Dragon fangs are a rare material. Of course we'll duplicate it just in case.

<blank>

MU!　This is definitely the fang of the Thunder Dragon!"

It was as if I hit him and he came to his senses."

"You punched a dragon?　You hit a dragon?

Yeah, well, I was surprised when the guy in the iguana car told me I was a dragon. Well, I was surprised when the guy in the iguana car told me it was a dragon. Oh, it ran away. Yeah, with a whiz. In that direction?　Didn't you see it?"

<blank>

I'm not lying, I left out the subject, but it was the iguana car that ran away, not the dragon. Yup. Is that a little confusing?　Sorry, I'm not good at Japanese. I'm not from this world.

<blank>

I didn't see it, but surely these fangs are proof that there were other dragons besides that one. I am sorry for doubting you. If you want, you can provide me with the evidence.　Of course, I will pay you enough money.

"If you're willing to buy it--uh, no. Go ahead, I'll give it to you."

<blank>

I was going to sell it, but then I remembered that this was a reproduction.

I decided on my own that I would not sell reproductions, so this is not for sale.

Since we have no choice, as a bona fide member of the public, let's say they give us the evidence for free.

<blank>

Is ...... good?"

Yes, I can even pick them off my pets if I want.

'Gigya!　Miss!"

Oh, oh. ...... in moderation?"

<blank>

Don't worry, I'll fix it when I pick it up. ...... I can copy it without picking it up in the first place!

And then he turned to me with a sharp look.

<blank>

Thank you for providing this valuable evidence. May I ask your name?"

I'm Carina, the peddler. I'm a peddler, Karina. ......　The guy who hit the dragon was a healer!　He's in the car right there!　But he's a difficult guy!　It's better not to face him!"

<blank>

Yikes, I accidentally called myself that.

It is the healers who do the outrageous things, not Kalina, the most beautiful girl in the universe.

<blank>

"...... got it. We will check to see if the dragon threat has passed. If you are heading to Rosetta, could you deliver the letter?　I'll pay for the delivery."

Uh, Rosetta, uh, yes, Rosetta. Rosetta, uh, yes, Rosetta. If you just keep going down the street."

He said, "Oh. Just give it to the gatekeeper."

<blank>

Oh, I thought it was the name of a town from the story, but it looks like a bingo. Good thing.

Ha, I'll ask Isiah the name of the place later.

<blank>

Miss, please tell them about the guy who put an aphrodisiac on you. If the dragon king blames you for the problem, you will be scolded by him.

<blank>

...... I don't have a choice. But Karina, you take good care of me, so I'll listen to this much.

<blank>

(That being said, I've been wanting to write a new piece, but I just can't find the time to do it...!)
