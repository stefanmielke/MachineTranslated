# For now, shall we buy something and hear the story? (From Diar's perspective)

<b>

Well then, we've arrived at the magic tool shop.

<b>

"Look, Arthur. This is a magic tool that plays a melody!"

"Wow, that's amazing! A music box, huh? I wonder if the sister would be happy about it."

<b>

Bringing a magic tool as a gift is also an option.

<b>

"By the way, I feel like we've been watched from a distance for a while now."

"Well, it's a combination of an elf and a dragon. It's strange if we aren't being watched."

"True enough. For now, shall we buy something and hear the story?"

<b>

With that, I picked up a potion that was right there and headed to the counter.

…A paralysis potion. It seems to be a potion that causes paralysis rather than curing it, used as a painkiller. I didn't know such things existed.

<b>

"Excuse me, I'll take this."

"O-oh. That'll be two large copper coins."

"Here you go. By the way, I heard there’s a divine artifact in this town."

<b>

To be precise, it’s in the country, but I narrowed it down to the town to probe a bit.

<b>

"What’s this, elf? Are you here to see the wall-breaking hammer?"

<b>

What a lucky hit! Today is my lucky day.

<b>

"So the divine artifact is called the wall-breaking hammer."

"Ah, no. The wall-breaking hammer is just a nickname. The official name is something like Hepa... well, it’s housed in the museum."

<b>

It seems that wasn’t the official name. However, I found out where it is.

<b>

"A museum? There’s a museum in this town?"

"Yeah. The elder of the five great elders made it because he believed that aesthetic sense is essential for craftsmen."

<b>

The five great elders. That’s the influential figure in Tesshin that the sister just mentioned she got close to.

The elder referred to must be Lord Vermilion.

<b>

"The location is over that way. It might be small for other races since it’s aimed at dwarves, but it should be fine for you, young lady."

<b>

The shopkeeper smiled proudly.

<b>

"Actually, I'm a guy."

"Oh right, I can't fool my eyes, but let's just go with that."

<b>

Yeah, seems like a blind spot.

<b>

"By the way, is that big lizard over there... a baby dragon? If it has scales, could you sell them to me? I’ll give you one large silver coin, no, two coins for one!"

"Whoa, you’re haggling pretty hard, huh? Hehe. One scale for one gold coin!"

"What!? A vocabulary card!? A dragon that understands words!? …Is it really genuine!? B-but one gold coin is too expensive!"

"If that's the case, then it's fine. It might be something you can't get again. Let's go, Master."

<b>

With that, Arthur tried to pull me out of the shop with his tail.

The casual way he calls me Master is quite the performance.

<b>

"Wait, wait, wait. …I didn’t say I wouldn’t pay. How about two gold coins for three scales?"

"Hmm, well, if that's the case, then it's fine? Here, let’s exchange."

"Ugh... I never knew dragons were so good at business...! Here, take it, two gold coins!"

<b>

With that, Arthur easily exchanged the scales for two gold coins.

To earn gold coins so easily, dragons are truly fearsome. No, Arthur is.

<b>

"Thanks for your business! Come again!"

<b>

Waved off by the shopkeeper, we left the magic tool shop.

……

<b>

"By the way, what’s the market price for dragon scales?"

"About six large silver coins for one scale. You bought it a bit high! Freshly plucked from the real deal, direct from the source, so I guess you could say I added some color for that?"

"Oh, so it’s not a rip-off."

"Yeah, it’d be troublesome if we were resented. We stand out too much."

<b>

With that, we obtained the information about the divine artifact we were after and returned to our base.

<b>

<b>

By the way, when I gifted the painkiller potion to the sister as a get-well gift, she was very happy and hugged me, and the sweet scent made my nose feel warm, but that’s a secret. Yes.
