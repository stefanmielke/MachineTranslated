# Shall we just buy something and listen to what you have to say (Deere's point of view)?

<blank>

Well, that's how I came to the grimoire shop.

<blank>

Look, Arthur. They say this is a magical tool that plays melodies!"

I'm sure Miss Hagan will be pleased!　A music box. I wonder if Miss Hana will be pleased.

<blank>

It is also possible to use magical tools as a sympathy gift.

<blank>

"...... By the way, I'm getting the feeling you've been watching me a lot from afar since a while ago."

Well, it's a combination of an elf and a dragon. It would be crazy not to see it.

'Mm, sure. ...... for now, let's just buy something and see what you have to say."

<blank>

I picked up one of the potions that was just there and headed for the counter.

...... paralyzing potion. It seems to be a potion that does not correct paralysis, but on the contrary, numbs it and stops the pain. I didn't know there was such a thing.

<blank>

Excuse me, can I have this?"

Oh, oh. Two large copper coins."

Yes. ...... By the way, I heard there's a sacred artifact in this town."

<blank>

I'm going to ask the country to be precise, but I'm going to ask the town to be more specific.

<blank>

What is it, Mr. Elf, you've come to see the Breaking Wall Hammer?"

<blank>

We hit the jackpot out of the blue!　Today is my lucky day.

<blank>

So the sacred artifact is called the "Breaking Wall Hammer."

Oh, no. No. The "Hepa Hammer" is a common name for the hammer. The official name is Hepa Nuncha ....... Well, it's enshrined in a museum."

<blank>

It did not seem to be the official name. However, I found the location.

<blank>

"Art museum?　Is there an art museum in this town?"

Oh," he said, "the Five Elders of the Bar have made it so. The Five Elder Barr said that a sense of aesthetics is essential for a craftsman.

<blank>

The Five Elders. He is the heavyweight of this Tessin and just the person your sister said she got along with.

Mr. Barr is probably Mr. Vermillion among them.

<blank>

The place is over there. It's for dwarves, so it might be small for other races, but, well, I'm sure your daughter will be fine."

<blank>

The owner of the restaurant smiles smugly.

<blank>

"No, I'm a guy."

"Oh, yeah," he said, "my eyes can't be fooled. My eyes can't deceive me, but I'll just leave it at that.

<blank>

Yeah, it looks like a knot.

<blank>

And by the way. Is that monitor lizard over there possibly a child of the ...... dragon?　If you have some scales or something, would you sell them to me?　I'll give you a large silver coin, or two, for one!"

Oops, you're really underpricing me, aren't you?　One gold coin for one gold coin!

What?　Word cards!　A dragon that understands words! ...... Oh, it's real!　But one gold coin is too expensive!"

If so, it's okay, I just might not get it again. Let's go, master.

<blank>

And Arthur tries to pull me by the tail to get out of the store.

Casually calling him master is a masterful performance.

<blank>

I'm not saying I won't put out . I didn't say I wouldn't pay ....... I mean, can't I get two gold coins for three scales?"

'Hmm, well, that's good, right?　Just a little bit. Here, let's exchange.

I've never known ...... dragons to be good at business!　Take that, two gold coins.

<blank>

and Arthur easily exchanged the scales for two gold coins.

A dragon is a fearsome thing to earn gold this easily. No, Arthur.

<blank>

Thank you every time!　Come again, won't you!"

<blank>

The owner saw me off and I left the grimoire shop.

......

<blank>

By the way, what's the going rate for dragon scales?"

I got 6 large silver coins for 1 piece. They paid a little more for it!　It's fresh from the real thing, and it's direct from the source, so they added a little color to it.

Oh, so it's not like you're getting ripped off or anything."

We don't want people to hold a grudge against us. We stand out.

<blank>

And so, with the information about the sacred object of our goal, we returned to our base.

<blank>

<blank>

I also gave my sister a pain relief potion as a sympathy gift, and between you and me, she was very pleased and hugged me, and the sweat smelled so good that it warmed the back of my nose. Yes, I know.

<blank>
