# Isn't it the best to be fluffy?

<b>

With that said, I left the watch (mostly to Aisia) and the day of the new moon was finally approaching.

<b>

"There's no sign of movement, huh?"

"That's right, my lord."

<b>

Aisia said while switching roles as the healer.

Recently, it had become cumbersome to change my voice and appearance every time, so I just wore a robe.

Oh, I've made it so that I can transform into a healer immediately if someone comes. Yup.

<b>

"Well then, I'll leave my lord to you."

"Sure. Please take care of dinner. The stew from yesterday was delicious."

"I'm glad to hear that. It makes it worth cooking. Well then."

<b>

Aisia lightly bowed to Mashiro and returned to her backpack.

Mashiro had completely blended in with us, but she didn't use the storage space except for the bath. She rested and ate in front of the dungeon core.

<b>

It seems to be because we are on a quest.

I suggested that she at least use the storage space when sleeping, but she said that if she went inside, she wouldn't know what was happening outside at all, and she would become anxious about whether the core she was protecting was safe.

<b>

<b>

That said, in reality, we had set up some sort of barrier or sensor at the entrance to the lower levels of the dungeon—where it had turned into a forest—so that it would react to any suspicious individuals using spatial magic, but only those who properly greeted the door guard were entering.

<b>

Of course, the new passage I found had no foot traffic at all.

Do the enemies really move? Have they given up and gone elsewhere?

<b>

<b>

As I was yawning while thinking like that, Mashiro poked me.

<b>

"Don't let your guard down too much, Karina. The enemy is definitely on alert."

"Hmm, I wish Mashiro's sense of smell could quickly find any suspicious individuals."

"Impossible. Mine is half intuition. Besides, even if I can somewhat distinguish bad people, adventurers usually have some kind of scars, right?"

<b>

By that logic, it means Mashiro must have some kind of guilty secret too, right?

<b>

"…What kind of scars do you have, Mashiro?"

"Oh, actually, I left home after punching my old man, so I might be wanted."

"Is your father the kind of person who gets you wanted for hitting him?"

<b>

Is Mashiro a case of a girl from a pretty good family becoming an adventurer?

<b>

"It's not a big deal. My old man has nearly fifty kids, so I might be forgotten."

"Wow, beastmen really have a lot of children, huh?"

"When I left home, my wife count was eight."

<b>

That's a harem. Wow. What is that, a king or something?

<b>

"I'm saying this because you might misunderstand, but he's just a village chief. It might be closer to say he's a chieftain; I'd accept being called a barbarian without any complaints."

"Wait, does a beastman village chief really have that kind of harem?"

"I don't know about others, but ours was like that. Does it convey the feeling of strong males being surrounded?"

<b>

I see. Being beastmen, they have a beast-like ecology.

On the contrary, weak males seem to have a miserable time, but let's set that aside.

<b>

"Mashiro, you seem like you'd be popular too. You're beautiful and strong."

"Oh? That's right, I'm popular. I can't even count how many men and women I've made cry."

"Ah, so you really are popular with women too."

"Of course, you slept with me too, didn't you? I'll pay the rent today, you know."

<b>

When said so boldly, I feel… shy…!

I mean, with Mashiro, I completely turn into a female! Ugh!

While I can't compare in technique to the older sister Harumikazuchi, the roughness of her strength is addictive, or rather, um… yeah.

<b>

"…Please don't make a move on Dia-kun and Aisia, okay?"

"Don't be stupid. Why would I make a move on kids? Rather, I'm being made to help you release your pent-up feelings so you won't make a move."

"That's true."

<b>

In reality, both of them are older than me and legal, though.

Well, I do give Aisia a quick peck when we pass by. She's adorable.

<b>

<b>

"Still, what will we do if no enemies come until the new moon, or even after it?"

"I don't know. As long as I get the quest fee from the guild, I can continue the watch."

"…If that's how Mashiro feels, maybe I'll join you."

"Hehe, that makes me happy! Having a friend makes it easier to pass the time!"

<b>

She hugged my head tightly and playfully rubbed against me.

It hurts a bit, but the good smell and fluffiness are the best, right? Also, is it heaven that her breasts are pressed against me? Oh, actually, the pain is a bit of a reward, or something. Ah.

<b>

"…Karina, you're really a peculiar one."

"Eh, really? What do you mean?"

"Nothing at all."

<b>

I didn't quite understand, but Mashiro and I flirted while keeping watch over the dungeon core.

<b>

<b>

――And then, the day after we said such things, there was finally some movement.
