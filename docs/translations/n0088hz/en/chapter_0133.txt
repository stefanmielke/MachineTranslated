# Fluffy and great, huh?

<blank>

After such a watch (almost entirely thrown on Aisia), the day of the new moon was finally approaching.

<blank>

I don't see any movement."

Yes, I see that, Sir."

<blank>

He says so while taking over the role of healer from Isiah.

Lately I've gotten tired of changing my voice and appearance every single time, so I just robe.

Oh, I'm ready to turn into a healer as soon as someone comes along. I'm ready to turn into a healer as soon as someone comes.

<blank>

Then I will leave you in charge.

Oh, I'll see you for dinner. I'm looking forward to having you for dinner. Yesterday's stew was delicious."

It's very rewarding to hear you say that. Well then."

<blank>

Aisia lightly bows to Mr. Masiello and returns to her backpack.

Masilo-san was completely comfortable with us, but he did not use the storage space room except for the bath. It is in front of the dungeon core that he rests and eats his meals.

<blank>

In case you're wondering, they say it's because they're in the middle of a request.

I told him that he could at least use the storage space when he sleeps, but once inside, he is completely unaware of what is going on outside and is restless because he is worried about whether the core he is escorting is safe.

<blank>

<blank>

In fact, however, there are wards or sensors at the entrance to the lower level of the dungeon - the part of the dungeon that is forested - that react with spatial magic if there is a suspicious person, but only those who greet the doorkeeper and enter the dungeon are in the room.

<blank>

Of course, the new passageway I found is completely empty of people.

Will the enemy really move? Didn't they already give up and go elsewhere?

<blank>

<blank>

As I was yawning with this thought, Mr. Masilo poked me.

<blank>

Don't be too careful, Karina. I'm sure they're on their guard."

"Hmm, wouldn't it be nice if Masilo-san's sense of smell could spot suspicious characters in a flash?"

I can't do it. I have half a hunch. Besides, even if I can identify a few bad guys, every adventurer has some kind of flaw, don't you think?

<blank>

By that theory, you must have something to be guilty of, don't you, Mr. Masiello?

<blank>

What kind of flaws does Mr. ...... Masilo have?"

"Yeah, I left home after I beat up my dad. Actually, I left home after beating up my dad, so maybe he's a wanted man.

'Are you the kind of parent whose status is such that you're wanted for punching?

<blank>

Is this a pattern of a young lady from a pretty nice place being an adventurer, Masilo?

<blank>

It's not that big a deal. My dad has almost 50 kids, and he's probably forgotten about them."

"Wow, beastmen must have a lot of kids."

When I left home, I had eight wives.

<blank>

It's a harem. Oh, man. What is that, like a king or something?

<blank>

I'm just a village chief. I'm just a village chief. "Chief is probably closer to it, but I'll accept it even if you call me a barbarian.

"What, the chief of a beastman village is in such a harem situation?"

I don't know about others, but we were like that. Can you tell that they flock to the stronger males?"

<blank>

I see. It's a beastly ecology, just because it's a beast.

On the other hand, the weak males look miserable, but I'll leave that aside.

<blank>

I think Masilo-san is also very popular with the girls. She's beautiful and strong."

Oh?　Yes, I'm very popular. I can't count the number of times I've made men and women squeal.

'Oh, I knew I was popular with the ladies.'

You slept with me, too, didn't you? I'm going to pay you rent again today.

<blank>

When you say it with such bravado, I'm, you know, embarrassed. ......

I mean, with Masilo-san, I'm completely turned into a female!　Oh, no!

Although her technique is not as good as Harumikazuchi's sister's, the roughness of her force is addictive, or, well, you know,...... yeah.

<blank>

......Dear, you and Isiah are not to be messed with, are you?"

Don't be silly, I don't mess around with kids. I'd rather help you vent so you don't touch them.

It is."

<blank>

As a matter of fact, they are both older than me and legit.

No, I do at least give Isiah a hug when we pass each other. She's adorable.

<blank>

<blank>

What if the enemy doesn't come until the new moon, or even past the new moon?

I don't know. As long as I get paid by the guild, I don't care if I continue to watch.

......If that's the stance you're taking, I might go out with you."

I'm glad to hear that!　It's nice to have a friend to pass the time with!"

<blank>

The head is held firmly and the child is nuzzled by the head.

I mean, it hurts a little, but it smells good and it's fluffy and it's great, right?　And the tits are also a little sore, which is heavenly, right?　Oh, it's more like a reward for the pain. Ahh...

<blank>

...... Carina, you really like things, don't you?"

What?　I mean, what?"

It ain't nothing."

<blank>

I wasn't sure, but Masilo and I made out while monitoring the dungeon core.

<blank>

<blank>

--and the day after he said that, there was finally a move.
