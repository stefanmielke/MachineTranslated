# This is an easy job to lightly nail down.

Once again, he was to receive a sacred object from the king.

Old Maria takes the post to the castle and I disguise myself as a healer and wait for the signal.

It is a simple job to receive the sacred artifact from the king when you get the signal, and while you are at it, lightly nail him with the words, "I forgive you this time, but don't steal from others.

<blank>

......Oh, a tag has been posted in the mailbox to signal me to go. I'm off then.

<blank>

* * * *

It is a reasonably luxurious room, although it has no windows. It seems to be a hidden room in the royal castle.

Healers gnawed and appeared on what appeared to be a simplified altar there.

<blank>

There were three people there, except for me.

One is Grandma Maria. She is dressed in aristocratic mode chic. She looks more formal than the other day at the tea party and is standing next to the post placed on the altar.

One is a king. He is kneeling at the altar, or rather, facing me, wearing a crown and a red cape, dressed as a king should be.

The last one is the large man from the escort we saw the other day. This one is also wearing blue armor and is kneeling while standing diagonally behind the king.

<blank>

"Raise the ...... surface."

<blank>

As he said the lines as discussed with Old Maria, the king looked up and saw the healer.

...... Well, what are we going to do now?　and looks at Grandma Maria.

<blank>

"Dear messenger, this is our king, King Pavelkant III. This is our king, King Pavelkanth III.

Mm-hmm. We met the other day. I'm sorry we didn't have much time to talk."

No, I am not!　Messenger, I'm very sorry about the other day."

<blank>

The king bows his head again after saying so.

Rude?　I don't remember anything. ...... I only remember that we were rather rude to you.

<blank>

"Messenger, the Commander of the Kingsguard here, Goway, has turned his sword on you."

<blank>

You didn't pull out your sword, did you?　You just had your hand on the hilt, right?

<blank>

I only remember him as a good subject who was faithful to his duties.　I only remember him as a good subject who was faithful to his duties, take good care of him."

Ha, ha!　Thank you, messenger."

<blank>

The king and his escort bow their heads at the rate that their heads touch the floor, albeit on a red carpet that extends from the altar.

I mean, I'm super bossy. I feel so awkward.

Grandma Maria, you're okay with this, right?　Even though I was told to keep it super big!

<blank>

'Sire, the apostle is puzzled, so much the better.

"Hah!"

<blank>

The king looks up again.

<blank>

It pains me to take up the messenger's time, so I'll get right to the sacred artifact."

Yes. Goway."

"Hah!"

<blank>

The large man escorting him - the Commander of the Kingsguard - took out of a small bag a fake of the sacred weapon "Breaking Wall Hammer" - a hammer that is hollow, light, and cannot break castle walls. It was a real pico-pico hammer that was hollow and lightweight, and could not even break down the walls.

<blank>

It is first given to Old Mary. Then the healer receives it.

<blank>

I'm sure I took care of it. --Oh, yes, I did. As a reward for returning the sacred artifact, I forgive you for this one time for being a thief. I have not communicated this to you well enough. I will talk to Tessin myself.

"...... ha!　Thank you, sir!"

<blank>

The king looks somewhat relieved.

<blank>

I tell you again ...... that the world's energy balance is negative due to numerous divine artifacts. Therefore, I have been ordered by God to recover the divine artifacts. However, this does not mean that the world will be destroyed immediately in 10 years. As long as God watches over this world, it will still be fine for now."

I'm sorry, I didn't realize that. Quick mistake: ......."

"Mariabelle, gee whiz. Maria Belle. I'm afraid I've misled you on that point."

I am very sorry. It is my fault."

"Good," he said, "because now we have a sacred object. "Good, because we now have a sacred object in our hands.

<blank>

And here I open a hole in the ceiling with spatial magic.

The destination is "a space that is dazzlingly luminous. Then, the false sacred object was softly put away there by spatial magic.

<blank>

"Oh ...... this is how God works ......!"

<blank>

In fact, this is a production that is under consideration by Mee and his team for the Divine Return Ceremony.

The king is this impressed and it looks like we can officially adopt it.

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, and while we're at it, let's treat your physical ailments a little."

Huh?"

<blank>

And I yodeled down the altar and touched the king's head a little.

With massage Lv 5, this level of contact is enough to get rid of the stiff shoulders!

<blank>

I mean, my insides are falling apart. I guess it's tough when you're the king. My stomach is stressed ......

...... stomach cancer this. Ei scan. ...... Hmmm, it hasn't metastasized. Then, I'll use space magic to remove it. The empty space is filled with the appropriate arrangement and copied and pasted.

<blank>

It's easier than growing limbs!

<blank>

"This is ...... a light ...... body, and the pain in the organs has disappeared ......!"

I was sick. "Well, it seems to have been a disease. There was a lesion, so I removed it."

"Thank you very much ...... messenger ......!"

<blank>

The king is in tears.

You're welcome. I know you have a tough job, but good luck!

<blank>

I'm going home. And work in moderation."

The messenger has returned.

<blank>

Old Maria said, 'What the hell did you do?' ' with her eyes. A great face, good thing the king was crying and couldn't see her.

Well, was I wrong to fix it?　I guess I'll have to reflect on this later. ...... Can't I back out?
