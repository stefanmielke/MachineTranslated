# It's a simple job to lightly remind someone.

<b>

I was to receive the sacred artifact from the king again.

Maria would take the post to the castle, so I would disguise myself as a healer and wait for the signal.

Once I received the signal, I would take the sacred artifact from the king and casually remind him, "I'll let it slide this time, but don't steal from people."

<b>

...Oh, the signal card has been dropped into the post. Well then, I'm off!

<b>

Although there are no windows, it is a fairly luxurious room. It seems to be a hidden room in the royal castle.

The healer suddenly appeared at an altar that seemed to have been hastily constructed there.

<b>

There were three people besides me.

One was Maria. She was in a chic dress suitable for nobility. It looked more formal than when we had tea the other day, and she stood next to the post placed on the altar.

One was the king. Dressed in a typical royal outfit with a crown and a red cloak, he knelt at the altar, or rather, towards me.

The last one was the large bodyguard I had seen the other day. He was also in blue armor, kneeling slightly behind the king.

<b>

"......Raise your face."

<b>

As I recited the line we had discussed with Maria, the king raised his face and looked at the healer.

...Um, what am I supposed to do next? I looked at Maria.

<b>

"Your Excellency. This is our country's king, King Pavelkant III."

"Y-yes. We met the other day. I apologize for not being able to talk much."

"No! Your Excellency, I was the one who was rude the other day."

<b>

The king bowed his head again as he said this.

Rude? Did something happen...? I only remember being extremely rude myself.

<b>

"Your Excellency, it seems that the captain of the royal guard, Goei, pointed his sword at you."

<b>

Wait, he didn't draw his sword, did he? He just had his hand on the hilt, right?

<b>

"Did that happen? I only remember him being a loyal and good subordinate. Treat him well."

"Y-yes! Thank you, Your Excellency!"

<b>

Even though they were on the red carpet extending from the altar, the king and the bodyguard were bowing their heads so low that their foreheads nearly touched the floor.

I feel so important. This is awkward.

Maria, this is okay, right? I was told to act really important!

<b>

"Your Majesty, the apostle seems to be troubled, so that should be enough."

"Yes!"

<b>

The king raised his face again.

<b>

"I feel bad for taking your time, so let's proceed with the sacred artifact."

"Yes. Goei."

"Yes!"

<b>

Saying that, the large bodyguard—the captain of the royal guard—took out the fake sacred artifact, the "Wall-Breaking Hammer," from a small bag. It was a lightweight, hollow object that couldn't break walls and made a silly sound like a toy hammer.

<b>

It was first handed to Maria, and then the healer received it.

<b>

"I have certainly received it. --Ah, right. As a reward for returning the sacred artifact, I will allow you to steal this time. I had a lack of communication as well. I will speak to Tesshin about it."

"......Yes! Thank you very much!"

<b>

The king's face relaxed a bit.

<b>

"To reiterate... due to numerous sacred artifacts, the world's energy balance is in the negative. Therefore, I have been commanded by the gods to recover the sacred artifacts. However, this does not mean the world will perish in ten years. As long as the gods watch over this world, for now, we are still safe."

"I-I see. I jumped to conclusions..."

"Maria, ahem. Maria Belle. It seems I have caused a misunderstanding on that point."

"I sincerely apologize. It is my fault."

"It is fine. We have managed to obtain one sacred artifact like this."

<b>

At this point, I used spatial magic to open a hole in the ceiling.

On the other side was a "blindingly bright space." Then, I gently stored the fake sacred artifact there using spatial magic.

<b>

"Oh... this is the work of the gods...!"

<b>

Actually, this is a performance that I am considering with Mi-chan and the others for the sacred artifact return ceremony.

The king seems so moved; it looks like it could be officially adopted.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, since we're at it, let me heal some of your physical ailments."

"Eh?"

<b>

With that, I hopped down from the altar and lightly touched the king's head.

With Massage Level 5, even this level of contact is enough to have a significant effect, so let's relieve that shoulder stiffness!

<b>

By the way, his body is in bad shape. It must be tough for someone of the king's stature. Stress has caused his stomach to...

...This is stomach cancer. Let's scan. ...Hmm, it hasn't metastasized. Well, since I'm at it, I'll extract it with spatial magic. I'll tidy up the empty space and copy-paste to fill it.

<b>

It's easier than growing limbs!

<b>

"W-what is this... my body feels light... the pain in my organs has disappeared...?!"

"Yes. It seems you were suffering from some illness. I removed the affected area."

"Thank you... Your Excellency...!"

<b>

Tears started to fall from the king's eyes.

You're welcome. I know your job is tough, but hang in there.

<b>

"Now, I shall take my leave. Moderation in work is important."

"Your Excellency's departure."

<b>

Maria gave me a look that seemed to say, "What on earth did you do!?" Taking advantage of the fact that the king was crying, she made a fierce expression.

Um, was it bad to heal him? I guess there will be a reflection meeting later... Is it okay to skip out?
