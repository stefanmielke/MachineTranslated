# Bravo, oh, bravo ● With Illustrations

<b>

Finally, the last pair, Mashiro-san's socks.

What will the appraisal amount be――

<b>

“――115 SP.”

“Exceeded the limit!?”

<b>

Without hesitation, the appraisal amount that came out exceeded the highest value of 100 SP.

<b>

“While the sense of shame is diluted, the hair... The hair is really good.”

“Oh, is it about the hair!”

<b>

It’s the part of the foot hair that Mashiro-san plucked for me!!

<b>

“Natural sock hair... nice! Ah, the breakdown is 25 SP for the initial sock, and 90 SP for the hair.”

“Oh. So that’s the total appraisal value.”

<b>

If it’s for two items, then the limit break is somewhat understandable.

Still, was the hair really that good?

<b>

“Well, it might be hard for Karina-chan to understand, but it’s hair. Moreover, it was plucked from near the paw pads on the sole. It’s a presence that lasts longer on the sole than a poorly made sock, you know? It’s like a sock that has been worn for about a month.”

“Oh ho.”

<b>

If foot hair is treated as a sock, then maybe I should aim for it again if I have a chance with a beastman.

<b>

“While the quantity is small, the flavor is rich. Munch munch... I have no idea why it’s in such demand, but that confusion is also good. It’s like a sticky avocado.”

“Wow, I want to put mayonnaise on it.”

“That’s precisely the seasoning called shame, yes.”

<b>

The god seemed satisfied as they put the rest away.

<b>

<b>

So, after completing the delivery, the SP is... exactly 1500 SP.

This neatness, the god must have calculated it, right?

<b>

“It’s more of a positive appraisal, you know? Like a baby palanquin.”

“Thanks a lot!”

<b>

Then I have no complaints! Yay!

<b>

“By the way, Karina-chan, instead of hoarding, you should use more SP. I won’t nag you since you’re delivering.”

“I’m sorry, but when my balance is low, I tend to tighten my wallet.”

<b>

With this much, I feel like I should be able to spend about 500 SP.

<b>

“Hmm. As a god, I’d prefer you to indulge in more rewards and become dependent, unable to stop delivering. Come on, let’s eat something delicious, shall we? There’s no chocolate in your world, right?”

“God?”

“Just being honest, okay? In reality, it’s like Siesta or something. Such a lovely thing.”

<b>

Well, it is a god. It can’t be helped.

<b>

“Then let’s spend about 500 SP here, shall we?”

“Eh?”

“I won’t let you go until you spend today, you know?”

<b>

What the heck. I’m usually sent off with “It’s time, so goodbye.”

...Thinking about it, the god is a time-space god, so even if time is pressing, they can do anything with their divine power. They’d probably say something like, “Late? Just rewind time, and it’s no problem.”

<b>

“Eh. Are you seriously not going to let me go?”

“Do you want to take your time and think slowly? That’s fine, I can stretch it for 10 years or 100 years, you know? I’m a time-space god after all.”

<b>

The scale of their sense of time is different...! So this is what a god is like...

<b>

The god took out a catalog and waved their hand.

The pages flipped, and a page opened. Oh, that looks like a delicious pudding à la mode.

<b>

“I recommend the sweets that disappear after you eat them around here.”

“You’re definitely trying to get me hooked... Considering the running costs, skills would be better, right?”

“It would be easier if it were items you’d want regularly like Siesta.”

<b>

It’s points they gave me, yet they’re so self-centered.

Well, it’s better than saying something weird and having it confiscated.

<b>

“Then how about this medicine that increases MP max by 10%? It’s 100 SP.”

“10% is certainly significant, but I haven’t really had trouble with running out of magic power.”

“Damn it! I made it too good!!... But without this, I might have had trouble tormenting that trash, so it can’t be helped.”

<b>

The god flipped through the catalog.

<b>

“Oh. How about this collection of used socks? Each for 200 SP.”

“I understand it’s your recommendation, but I don’t need someone else’s socks...!”

<b>

They’re lined up with pictures of the producers’ faces, and it’s just sketchy.

The god said, “Hmm, you have a lot of demands,” and opened another page.

Wait, was there even such a page...? That’s when I realized.

<b>

Huh? Isn’t this catalog different from mine?

<b>

After all, I flipped through mine and checked it out.

But I don’t remember seeing a sock collection catalog. If I had, I’d definitely remember.

<b>

If that’s the case, I might want some nice skills that aren’t in my catalog...

<b>

“Oh. How about technical skills? If you’re actually moving your body, having these skills would be better.”

“Certainly... That’s a valid option.”

“Oh, this massage skill is quite versatile when it reaches Level 5. It’s rare too... Wait, what? I don’t think I put this rare one in Karina-chan’s catalog—”

“Then I’ll take that!!—Huh?”

<b>

The moment I showed a gap, the god smiled back instead.

Massage Level 5. Its price is a whopping 500 SP... just as planned.

<b>

I’ve been trapped.

<b>

“God, you can’t be serious.”

“Wonderful. You took the bait perfectly. Bravo, oh, bravo.”

“Um, can I cancel or something?”

“Oh, I don’t have a cooling-off period or refund service.”

As the god clapped their hands, a new skill was bestowed upon me.

(...Huh? Even though May is over, the book publication work isn’t finished yet?

After one or two more chapters, I’ll definitely prioritize the book publication over updates...!?)
