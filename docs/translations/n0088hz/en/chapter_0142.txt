# Bravo, oh, bravo ●Illustration Ali

Finally, the last pair of socks, Mr. Masilo's socks.

What is the assessed value?

<blank>

115SP."

"I've gone over the edge!"

<blank>

The valuation, which came out without any desirability, was over 100 SP, the highest price.

<blank>

'Shame is thin, but the hair. ...... hairs are very good."

Oh, at the hairs!"

<blank>

It is the part of the leg hair that Masilo pulled out for me!

<blank>

"I like ...... for natural sock hair!　Oh, and the breakdown is 25 sp for the first socks and 90 sp for the hairs."

Oh. The total value of those assessments."

<blank>

For two pieces, the limit is well within reason.

But was it really that good, hairs?

<blank>

She said, "Well, Karina may not understand it, but it's hair. And it's the one that you plucked out from the sole of your foot near the ball of your foot. It's been on my sole longer than a bad sock, you know?　It's like a sock you've worn for a month or so."

Hohoho."

<blank>

If the hairs on your ...... feet are treated as socks, would you go for it if you had a chance with the beastie again?

<blank>

It's not much, but it tastes rich. The mogu...... confusion that I have no idea why it is so demanding is also good. Kind of like a sticky avocado."

Wow, I'm tempted to put mayonnaise on it."

That's the seasoning called shame, yeah."

<blank>

God put the rest away with satisfaction.

<blank>

<blank>

So, I finished the delivery and the SP is now ...... exactly 1500 SP.

God has already calculated this end, hasn't he?

<blank>

I'd say it's more of a positive assessment, you know?　Like a baby carriage."

Aaaaahhhh!"

<blank>

Then I have no complaints!　Hi!

<blank>

I mean, Carina, please don't save up and use more SP. I won't be picky, though, since you deliver."

I'm sorry, but I have a tendency to tighten my purse strings when my balance is low."

<blank>

I feel like I can spend about 500 SP if that's all I have in quicksand.

<blank>

Mmmm. As for God, I'd like him to be more addicted to the rewards, dependent on them, and unable to help but deliver them. Come on, come on, let's eat something delicious.　You don't have chocolate in your world, do you?"

God?"

You know what I mean?　In fact, it's probably like a siesta or something. It's a love."

<blank>

Well, he's God, isn't he? It can't be helped.

<blank>

Then let's spend about 500 SP here, let's do that."

Eh."

I won't let you leave until you spend today, okay?"

<blank>

What a surprise. I always get turned away with a 'it's time to go, see you later'.

...... If you think about it, God is a space-time god, who can do anything with his divine power, even if time is pressing. He might say, "Late?　If we rewind time, it won't be a problem.

<blank>

What?" he asked. Do you feel like they won't let you go home stiff?"

You want to take your time and think it over?　I can stretch it out for 10 years or even 100 years.　I am a space-time god.

<blank>

The orders of magnitude of our sense of time is so different. ......　Is this God? ......

<blank>

God takes out a catalog and holds up his hand.

The paper flipped open and the page opened. Oh my, a delicious looking pudding a la mode.

<blank>

I recommend the sweets around here that disappear after you eat them."

You're trying to swamp me, aren't you? I'd rather have skills than running costs and other cosmetic costs."

It would be easier if it were an item like Siesta that I would want on a regular basis."

<blank>

It is a point given to me, but very self-serving.

Well, it's better than saying something weird and having it confiscated.

<blank>

How about this medicine that increases the maximum MP value by 10%?　It costs 100 SP.

Ten percent is certainly a lot, but I've never had that much trouble running out of magic power.

Damn it!　I made it too excellent! Even ...... would have had to be this good or it would have been a hindrance to messing with that piece of garbage, so I had no choice."

<blank>

God flipping through the catalog.

<blank>

Oh. How about a duplicate of the used sock collection around here, 200 SP each?"

I understand that God is pushing it, but I don't need a sock from a stranger or anything else, so ......!"

<blank>

They are lined up with the producer's picture, and it is nothing but disreputable.

God says, "Mmmm, that's a lot of orders," and opens other pages.

I mean, I didn't know there was such a page ...... and here I am.

<blank>

Hmm?　Could this be different from my catalog?　I thought.

<blank>

Because I did check it out, although I was just paraphrasing.

But I don't remember seeing a sock collection catalog. If I had seen it, I'd definitely remember it, it's a quirk.

<blank>

If so, I might want some good feel-good skills that I don't have in my catalog or something: ......

<blank>

Ah. How about some technical skills?　If you're going to actually move your body, you'd better have some skills in this area."

Certainly ...... that is an option."

Oh, this massage skill or going up to lvl 5 is quite applicable. It's rare and ...... is that?　I don't think I put it in Carina's catalog because it's rare..."

So be it! --ha!"

<blank>

The moment I thought I had made a breakthrough - God was smiling back at me.

Massage Lv5. its price was a whopping 500SP...... price as planned.

<blank>

I was framed.

<blank>

God, no.

You did a wonderful job. You've bitten it beautifully. Bravo, oh, bravo."

Um, no cancellations or anything like that.

Oh, we don't offer a cooling-off or refund service."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Snap, snap, snap," God applauded, and at the same time, a new skill was lodged in me.

<blank>

(...... Huh?　May is over and we haven't finished the book work?

(After one or two more talks, I'll prioritize the book work over updating the quirks: ......!)
