# Sudden Interview with the Senior Adventurer Next Door

<b>

"Many adventurers and merchants tame their own scavenger slimes. It's a huge difference whether you have one or not when you're camping."

"Oh, is that so?"

"You don't have to pay for food, and in a pinch, you can use it as bait. By the way, do you want me to share mine? ... Just kidding, don't make that face."

<b>

What I heard from the senior adventurer Blade was information about camping that wasn't included in the basic knowledge.

Hmm, that's helpful. I have space magic, so I don't need to camp, but...

<b>

<b>

Ah, hello. I'm Karina. After using the toilet for the first time in this other world, I wanted to know what was lacking in the basic knowledge, so I decided to do a sudden interview with a senior adventurer!

<b>

Yes.

Well, the method of camping itself was included in the basic knowledge.

However, the information was quite rough. I really felt that it was just basic information.

In other words, I didn't know what to do if I needed to use the toilet outside.

<b>

By the way, my interviewee is Blade, who gave me a tip of a copper coin.

<b>

"...I didn't expect you to come and ask me directly. You're amazing. No, I'm complimenting you. The information that seniors have is important. Being able to come and ask about that is really going to make you a good adventurer."

"Well, I'm not that great. Oh, my mug is empty, here you go."

"Oh, thanks."

<b>

So, I approached Blade to hear about adventurers. I said, "I'll pour you a drink, so please tell me a bit about your adventures."

Blade looked surprised and said, "Huh!?" but then agreed, saying, "Well, okay."

<b>

As the receptionist said, he's really attentive.

Moreover, he even treated me to food. It's a feast worth five copper coins, with ham and lettuce sandwiched in bread.

Thanks, senior.

<b>

"Haha, that's not a bribe, so make sure to repay me later. If you can't, you can pay with your body."

"Ah, let's skip that. I'll earn money normally."

"Ahaha, Blade got rejected again."

"Ugh! No chance, huh! Just give up, Blade."

"Oh, you two look like your mugs are light, here you go."

"Oh, sorry about that."

"Wow, the alcohol is delicious today."

<b>

Blade's companions, a barrel-like big man named Shildon and a small, monkey-like guy named Sekko.

All of them have a C rank as adventurers. Well, they seem to be mid-level.

It seems they form a party of three adventurers. Blade and Shildon are the front line, while Sekko is the support role.

<b>

"By the way, Karina-chan, are you going solo? Didn't you have any friends to invite?"

"Well, I'm solo. I have confidence in my skills, you know. Plus, I'm planning to become a merchant eventually."

"Are you sure you can manage without even being able to pay the adventurer guild's registration fee? Well, in that case, you should start as a merchant. If you need a bodyguard, count on us! I think we'll be adventurers for at least another ten years."

"Yes, if the timing works out, I'd love to."

<b>

Well, since I have space magic, whether I ask for help is a bit of a gray area.

<b>

"Well, first you need to complete requests that can earn you money. Just joining the merchant guild costs two large silver coins and one medium silver coin, right? You need money to do business, so you'll have to save quite a bit."

"Keeping money in the guild is the safest. If you leave it at an inn, it might get stolen."

"Recommended requests? They say beginner requests are easy, but gathering medicinal herbs is surprisingly difficult. If you don't process them properly, they won't be usable. And not only that, there are idiots who take everything and end up depleting the gathering area..."

<b>

Hmm, the senior adventurer is really helpful.

Is it okay to get this much information just for pouring drinks? Yum yum.

<b>

"Then, how about requests for monster subjugation?"

"That said, first you need equipment... Right now, you look like a villager from any angle."

"Not having even a single weapon is practically asking to be attacked."

"I can understand why Blade couldn't help but call out to you... Oh, just to let you know, if it's under the pretext of being your lover, I can take care of you in the party. Normally, you can't put someone with a temporary guild certificate of G rank into a C rank party."

"Really, such circumstances exist?"

<b>

Ah, the information that the basic knowledge didn't cover is becoming more substantial.

Whether I'll use it in the future is another story.

<b>

"Don't stray too far from town; facing monsters can seriously get you killed. Honestly, thieves might be more likely to spare your life. You probably can't defeat them, though."

"If possible, I'd prefer delivery requests since they're safer... but they don't earn much money."

"For now, it's better than nothing, so later, go get some lumber from the scrap yard behind the guild. If you're lucky, there might be some boards too. If you tie them to your arm with a rope, they can serve as a shield."

<b>

Oh, that sounds like it could be useful once I learn woodworking skills...

But is there really usable scrap material lying around? Could it be a poverty relief measure for adventurers at the guild? Well, I am currently a poverty-stricken adventurer myself.

<b>

"I'm a mage, so I think I'll manage somehow."

"A mage? What kind of magic can you use?"

"Um... oh, I can cut wood."

"Air Cutter, huh? If that's the case, you should be able to hunt slimes safely. Rabbits might be good too."

"When you spill blood, goblins or wolves will appear, so it's best to collect what you hunt immediately and escape."

"Oh, be careful of wolves; their fur deflects blades. They're fast, so you can't escape. Their bellies are soft, so the easiest way is to slip in when they jump at you and stab them with a knife..."

"If you're surrounded, you're dead. Only strays appear near town, but if you go far, they come in groups, so definitely avoid that. Even if they take your knife, don't chase after them."

<b>

Yeah.

I mean, Blade and the others are really kind. They give so much advice just by saying a word... Are they allies of beginners? At this point, I might even allow a little fondling.

<b>

"First, get your equipment sorted! It's your partner for your life!"

"Yes, thank you for the advice, Blade-senpai!"

"Ha ha ha! Show your respect!"

"Ha ha! Thanks a lot! Thanks!"

<b>

I'm really grateful for the source of information. Once I become a merchant in the future, I'd like to return the favor with a commissioned request.
