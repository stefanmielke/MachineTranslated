# Assaulting the Senior Adventurer Next Door

<blank>

Many adventurers and vendors have their own scavenger slime. It makes a big difference when you're camping out.

Oh, really?

It doesn't cost me a dime, and I can use it as bait if I have to. I'll share mine with you. I'm just kidding, don't look at me like that."

<blank>

What I heard from Braid, a senior adventurer like that, was information for encampment that Mr. Basic Knowledge did not have.

Hmmm, that's good for you. I have space magic, so I don't need to stay in the field. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, hi. I'm Karina. After my first trip to the bathroom in another world, I wanted to know what I was missing from Basic Knowledge's information, so I went and interviewed a senior adventurer!

<blank>

Yes.

Well, the way to set up camp itself was included in Basic Knowledge.

But it was only very general information. I realized that it was really only basic information.

In other words, I didn't know what to do if I had to go to the bathroom outside.

<blank>

The interviewer is Mr. Braid, who gave us a coin.

<blank>

I didn't think you'd come to talk to me at ......, I mean, I didn't think you'd come to talk to me like a normal person. You're awesome. Oh, no, I'm complimenting you. The information that senpai have is important. You must be a really good adventurer to be able to ask for that kind of information.

"Oh, no, not so much. Oh, your mug is empty.

"Whoa, thank you."

<blank>

Yes, I had approached Mr. Braid myself in order to hear about his adventures from a senior adventurer. I asked him if he would pour me a drink and tell me about his adventures.

Braid looked surprised and said, "What? and after a look of surprise, he readily agreed, saying, "Well, okay.

<blank>

As the receptionist said, you really take good care of them.

And they even bought me a meal. It was a feast of bread with ham and lettuce sandwiched in between, the equivalent of five copper coins.

Seniors, ahoy!

<blank>

If you can't, you can pay me with your body. If you can't, I'll pay you with my body.

I don't want that kind of thing. I earn money normally."

Ah ha ha, Blade, you got dumped again."

I'm like, "Oh, no!　You ain't got no pulse!　Give it up, Blade."

Oops, you two look light on the jock too, here you go."

Oh, sorry."

'Oh no, the drinks are so good today...'

<blank>

Braid's companions, Shildon, a big man like a barrel, and Sekko, a small man like a monkey.

Adventurer ranks are all C. Well, it seems they are all middle-ranked.

They are in an adventurer party of three, apparently. The roles of the three are Braid and Shildon as the vanguard, and Sekko as the support.

<blank>

I mean, Karina, are you going to do it solo?　Didn't you have any friends to invite?"

I'm a soloist. I have confidence in my skills. Also, I plan to become a merchant one day.

I can't even pay the registration fee for the Adventurers' Guild.　Well, then, you'll have to be a peddler first. If you want us to escort you, take care of us!　I'll probably be an adventurer for another 10 years.

Yes, when the time is right.

<blank>

Well, there is spatial magic, so I'm not sure if I would ask for it.

<blank>

Well, first of all, we need to do something that will earn us some money. Just to join the merchants' guild, you need two large silver coins and one medium silver coin, right?　We also need money to do business, so we have to save up a lot of money.

I think it's safest to leave the money with the guild. If you leave it at an inn, it can be stolen.

A "recommended request?　They call it a beginner's request, but it is surprisingly difficult to collect medicinal herbs. The best way to do this is to get a good idea of what you're looking for. If that's all there is to it, there are still idiots who bring them in by the roots and kill the colony. ......

<blank>

Hmmm, seriously informative senior adventurer.

I wonder if I can get so much information just by pouring a glass of sake?　Yum yum yum.

<blank>

Then it's a request for a strike?"

But first of all, I don't have the right equipment. ...... Now you look like a villager to me.

Not having one of those weapons in the first place is like asking them to attack you."

I can see why Braid called out to him. ...... Oh, and in case you're wondering. The actuality that the actual guild is going to be the most effective way to get the most out of your guild. You can't normally put a G-rank with a temporary guild certificate into a C-rank party.

"Oh, my God, that's what happened."

<blank>

Oh, the information that Mr. Basic Knowledge didn't know is going to be enhanced.

Aside from whether it will be used in the future.

<blank>

Don't leave town too often, or you'll really die. If you want, the bandits will keep you alive. You won't be able to beat them.

I'd prefer to be safer with a delivery order if I could, but I don't make much ...... money."

You can get some lumber from the scrap yard behind the guild later. If you're lucky, you'll find some planks, and if you tie them to your arms with string, they'll serve as shields.

<blank>

Hohoho. That sounds like a lot of progress once I learn woodworking skills. ......

Is it possible that they have such usable waste materials on hand?　Could it be that the Adventurers' Guild is helping poor adventurers?　Well, I'm a poor adventurer myself right now.

<blank>

I'm a magician, so I think I can handle it."

A wizard?　What kind of magic can you do?"

"Ummm ...... Oh, I can cut wood."

I think it's an air cutter. Then the slime would be safe to hunt. Rabbits might be good too."

Spraying blood will bring out goblins and wolves, and once you've hunted them, you should immediately collect them and run away."

Oh, and watch out for the Wolf, his fur will repel blades. They're fast, so they can't run away. The belly is soft, so the easiest thing to do is to dive for it when it jumps at you and give it a good whack with a knife. ......

'It's the kind that will kill you if you're surrounded. Only stragglers appear near the town, but if you go far away, they will come out in groups, so don't do it. If they take the knife you stabbed them with, don't go too far.

<blank>

Yeah.

I mean, Braid is really kind. Just say a few words and they'll give you a lot of advice. ...... They are the friend of beginners, aren't they? I'd be willing to give them a boob job if I could.

<blank>

First, you need to get your equipment in order!　You're my partner and I'm trusting you with my life!"

Woohoo, that's very informative, Braid senior!"

Da-ha-ha!　Respect!"

Hahahaha, ahazus!　Azaaassssss!"

<blank>

Thank you for being a source of information. When I become a merchant in the future, I would like to return the favor by making a nomination request.
