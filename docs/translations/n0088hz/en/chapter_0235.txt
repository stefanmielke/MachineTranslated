# Is it double dipping of the sauce?

<b>

"Ah, and here are the socks for delivery. Dear-kun's, the tournament's, and Misha's pantyhose."

"Thank you! I've been waiting for this! ...Well, well, yum! 40 SP!!"

<b>

With a bang, the god slaps Misha's butt while conducting the assessment. There’s a phrase for expressing admiration that goes "to clap one's knees," but it feels something like that.

By the way, that was the assessment for the tournament, summing up my opponents, the older sisters.

<b>

"And this Misha's pantyhose is... yep! It's definitely a white sauce type! Although the aging period is short, it has a solid sense of shyness. There's also a decent satisfaction from getting some revenge, and the urgency of the tail pressed tightly against the crotch is overwhelming—yes, it's lasagna! It's lasagna!!"

<b>

The god spreads the crotch of the pantyhose wide and holds it up.

<b>

"Hmm, it was just delivered the other day, but I'll give it 50 SP!"

"Oh, well done, Misha...!"

<b>

Oh, a good assessment has been given. ...Moreover, they are rubbing the pantyhose against the person's butt. Is it double dipping of the sauce? We don't have any rules against it, so feel free to do as you like.

<b>

"Dear-kun's is... hehehe, nice. The first time in public with gothic lolita, and the脱衣 socks while gathering attention after losing to Misha... This can be likened to a shy strawberry shortcake & a slightly bitter chocolate cake! I'll give you a combined score of 100 SP!"

<b>

With a slap-slap! The god expresses joy by slapping Misha's butt. Each one is worth 50 SP, and even though Dear-kun was just delivered recently, it received quite a high score.

<b>

<b>

The balance is 1520 SP.

...I guess I should use 20 SP for something. Otherwise, the god might tell me to use 520 SP as the remainder.

<b>

"Then, I'll use this remainder of 20 SP on some skill."

"Hmm, in that case, I recommend this one for 120 SP!"

<b>

The god opens the catalog. Even though I said 20 SP, they went and increased it by one digit.

Um, let's see... oh. Gun skill Lv4. It's true that my weapon is currently a gun, but do I really need it? I have spatial magic...

<b>

"Actually, this skill is going to rise to 200 SP due to the soaring raw material prices. So, this price is only available now!"

"What, really!?"

<b>

The price written in the catalog is going to be revised... So that's a thing! That's unfair! The god is being sneaky!! By the way, what does soaring raw material prices even mean!?

<b>

They're really trying every trick in the book to make me waste my money!

<b>

<b>

Huh? I bought it, you know? Before the price increase. Balance is 1400 SP.

<b>

But can I actually use this skill... wait, everything this skill can do can be replicated with spatial magic...? I was doing ricochet shots during the tournament.

It's like I can fight with a gun even under the magic prohibition rule...? Hmm.

<b>

<b>

For now, I also slapped Misha's butt once for my own satisfaction. Bam.
