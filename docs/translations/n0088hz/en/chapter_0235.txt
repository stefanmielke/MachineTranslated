Oh, and here are the socks we delivered. Dear's, the tournament, and Misha's pantyhose."

Thank you."　I've been waiting! ...... Well, well, well!　40SP!!!!"

<blank>

Bash!　and God slapping Misha's buttocks while making an assessment. I've heard the expression "slap on the knee" when you are impressed, I guess it's like that.

By the way, that's a collective assessment of my opponent's sisters in the tournament.

<blank>

And this Misha pantyhose is ...... yeah!　It is still a white sauce type!　The maturity is short but firm and shameful. There is a sense of satisfaction of being able to return the favor there, and the impatience of the tail pressed tightly against the crotch covers this - yes, lasagna!　It's lasagna!

<blank>

And God, who spreads the crotch of the pantyhose in a square shape.

<blank>

'Hmmm, it was just delivered the other day, but I'll give you 50 SP!'

Oh, you're doing it, Misha......!"

<blank>

Oh, I got a good assessment. ...... And he's groping his own ass with his pantyhose. Is it a double dose of sauce?　We don't prohibit it, so you can put it on as much as you like.

<blank>

Dia-kun-chan's is ...... ehehe, I like it. Gothic Lolita in public for the first time, and undressing socks while losing Misha and attracting gazes...... This is so, if I may compare it to a strawberry shortcake of shame & a chocolate cake with a hint of hollowness and bitterness!　I give you 100 SP for the combined effort!"

<blank>

God, who was so happy to see Misha's buttocks smacked with "Bachin Bachin!　God, who revealed his happiness by slapping Misha's buttocks, 50 SP per piece, which was quite a high score, even though Dear had only recently delivered them and it was still early days.

<blank>

<blank>

Your balance is 1520 SP.

......20SP, I think I'll use something. Otherwise, God might tell me to use 520SP as a fraction.

<blank>

Then I'll use this fraction of 20 SP for some skill."

Mwah, then I recommend this one with 120 SP!"

<blank>

I said 20SP, but he added one more digit.

Let's see, what's the ...... way. Gunsmithing skill lvl 4, though admittedly my weapon of choice is a gun at the moment. I don't need it, do I?　I have spatial magic. ......

<blank>

The price of this skill will be raised to 200SP this time due to the rising cost of raw materials. So this is the only time you can buy it at this price!"

What?

<blank>

The prices in the catalog are revised ...... is there such a thing?　Zulu!　God, that's so sneaky!　I mean, what is this about raw material price hikes?

<blank>

They are really trying to get us to waste our money in that way!

<blank>

<blank>

What?　I bought it?　Before the price increase. Balance 1400 sp.

<blank>

Just wondering if this skill can be used ...... Hey, everything you can do with this skill, you can recreate with spatial magic ......?　I did ricochets and stuff like that at the convention.

Can we now fight with guns even with the no magic rule, or is that about it? ......?　Mmmm.

<blank>

<blank>

At any rate, I also gave Misha's ass a good whack on the stomach. Boom.
