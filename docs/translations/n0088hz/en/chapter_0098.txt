# It isn't always good to target weaknesses

(Stock is starting to look suspicious!)

"Burn my enemies, Fireball!!"

<b>

A basketball-sized fireball shot straight from Dia-kun's staff and hit a grasshopper—about the size of a cucumber. The burning grasshopper let out a death cry that sounded like it was squeezing air out, and was roasted to death.

<b>

"With small fry like this, a fireball is a one-hit kill."

"I may lose to your sister's magic, but I'm still an elf, you know."

<b>

Dia-kun puffed out his chest proudly.

By the way, this dungeon seems to have many insect-type monsters that are weak to fire. Thanks to the expensive staff, he can use it another hundred or thousand times.

<b>

<b>

"Master, Dia. I hear buzzing from over there. There seem to be a lot of them."

"Ugh, are they flying in a swarm... Dia-kun, can you handle them with fireballs?"

"It depends on their number and size, but I think I can manage with a firewall."

<b>

Oh, sounds good. ...Then, four fist-sized wasps flew in. Yellow hornets. I need to be careful of their poison stings.

<b>

"Block my enemies, Firewall!"

<b>

The wasps burned from Dia-kun's magic. Just then, one circled around, and I cut it down with spatial magic.

<b>

"Well, when you say 'a lot' with just four, it feels a bit underwhelming... Yeah, maybe we should study math, Aishia."

"Eh? Oh, yes. If Master says so."

<b>

I wonder how he managed money while traveling as a bard.

<b>

"Oh no, even the proof of extermination's stinger got burned."

"Oh, fire magic has that drawback too, huh... But this much should be fine, right? It's only half charred."

"Please put it in the backpack, Master."

<b>

Aishia turned her backpack towards me, so I stuffed it in carelessly. Of course, in reality, it's being stored in a spatial space. But it's a rehearsal for when Satitan comes later.

<b>

<b>

"Wasn't it the case that you can extract beeswax from hornets? Something like honey wax?"

"Oh! Since it's layered on as armor, it would be ruined by fire magic too. I'm sorry."

<b>

The beeswax from the ones Dia-kun defeated melted from the heat and soaked into the ground. I could retrieve it using spatial magic, but it's not worth going that far for such materials.

<b>

"It doesn't always mean it's good to target weaknesses, huh. Well, don't worry about it."

"Shall we try aiming just for their heads next time?"

<b>

And it smells nice, like shrimp. I wonder if this can be eaten too.

Do I have to process it before cooking? I see.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, there's something I've been curious about. There are so many monsters in the dungeon. Don't you think they might get depleted from overhunting? Where do they come from...?"

"......I wonder where? I just thought dungeons were like that."

"Oh my, you both don't know, Master and Dia? Then let me tell you."

<b>

At this point, former bard Aishia began to speak proudly.

<b>

"Dungeons are places where magic is born, dungeons are places where mana returns. The mana that fills the dungeon turns into droplets, and monsters are born and circulate again—so it is said."

<b>

I see. Dungeons gather magical power, increasing the spawn rate of monsters. ...So if we hunt and thin them out, they will eventually run out, or at least decrease.

However, after some time, the magical power will accumulate again, and monsters will be born anew.

<b>

"Wow, that's amazing. I wonder if ores are similar."

"Apparently, the armor ants here eat iron ore to thicken their armor, so it seems like they might produce ores too."

<b>

So we can mine infinitely. That's awesome.

<b>

<b>

In any case, since we dived in today to observe, we hunted a few more monsters in the shallow layers and returned from the dungeon with ease.

The earnings from the collected materials and proof of extermination, even after deducting the entrance fee, totaled three silver coins.

Hmm, if I can dive in like this easily, I could probably earn even more if I went deeper. Dungeons might be quite profitable.
