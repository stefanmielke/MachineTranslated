# So, it's not always a good idea to exploit a weakness.

(I'm starting to wonder about my stock!)

<blank>

Burn my enemies, Fireball!"

<blank>

A basketball-like fireball flew straight from the tip of Dear's stick and hit a grasshopper - a grasshopper as big as a cucumber. The grasshopper burns. The grasshopper let out a loud, air-twisting roar as it burned to death.

<blank>

A little thing like this would be a blow with a fireball."

'It's not as good as your sister's magic, but then again, I'm an elf.

<blank>

Dia-kun proudly boasts, "Eh, huh?

Incidentally, this dungeon is said to be full of insects and many demons with a weakness to the fire attribute. Thanks in part to the expensive staff, they can use it for a hundred or a thousand more rounds.

<blank>

<blank>

"Dear Sir, Dear Sir. I hear the sound of wings over there. There seem to be a lot of them.

"Gee, the ones that fly in groups. ...... Dear, can you deal with the fireball?"

It depends on the number and size of the firewalls, but I think a firewall could keep them down."

<blank>

Oh, that's nice. I went to ...... and saw four fist-sized bees flying around. Yellow Hornet. Beware of poisonous stingers.

<blank>

Block my enemies, firewall!"

<blank>

Deer, your magic burns the bees. And one of them came around and I cut it off with my space magic.

<blank>

I think it's a bit disconcerting when you say four is a lot. ...... Yeah, let's study some arithmetic, Isiah."

Huh?"　Ah, yes. If the Master says so."

<blank>

I wonder what he did with his money and such when he was traveling as a bard.

<blank>

Oh shoot, I even burned the needle on my defeat certificate.

'Oh, with fire magic, it has those drawbacks. ...... isn't it okay this much?　It's only half charred."

Please, put it in your backpack. Dear Master."

<blank>

Aisia turns the backpack on her back toward me, so I shove it in appropriately. Naturally, I actually put it away in the storage space. But it is a rehearsal for when I come back later with Sati.

<blank>

<blank>

I think the Hornet type can get beeswax from the body, right?　Honey wax or something like that."

Oh!　I'm applying it in layers as armor, so fire magic would ruin that too. Sorry."

<blank>

The beeswax that Deer had knocked down had melted under the heat and seeped into the ground. It is possible to recover it by using spatial magic, but it is not a material worth going that far with.

<blank>

I guess it's not always a good idea to exploit a weakness. Well, don't worry about it.

Next time, I'll just go for the head."

<blank>

And they smell good, like shrimp, though. I wonder if this is edible too.

Do I have to treat it before baking?　I see.

<blank>

<blank>

By the way, I was wondering about one thing. I'm not sure where they come from.　Where do they come from? ......

"I wonder where ...... is?　I thought that's what dungeons were for.

"Oh, well, neither you nor Dia know about this?　Then I will teach you.

<blank>

And here Isiah, a former minstrel, begins to speak with great skill.

<blank>

It is said that a dungeon is a place where demons are born, and a dungeon is a place where mana returns. It is said that the mana that fills the dungeon becomes a drop of mana, and the demons are born and return to the dungeon.

<blank>

I see. So a dungeon is a space that collects magical power and increases the rate of demons? If you go to ......, if you kill the demons and thin out the population, they will eventually run out, or rather, they will decrease.

However, after a period of time, the magic will build up again and demons will be born, he said.

<blank>

I wonder if it's like that with ores. I wonder if ores are like that.

I heard that armor ants here eat iron ore to thicken their armor, so it is likely that they produce ore as well."

<blank>

You can mine without limit. Amazing.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, we dove in today as a wait-and-see experience, and returned from the dungeon with plenty of time to spare after hunting a few more demons in the shallower layers.

The total earned from the materials collected and the proof of defeat, minus the entrance fee, was three silver coins.

Well, if I can earn this much with a quick dive, I can probably earn even more if I dive hard. Dungeons may be quite tasty.
