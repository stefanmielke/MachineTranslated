# Dear-kun's Secret Plan

<b>

Dear-kun's secret plan against the Phantom Thief Hermes. That is――

<b>

<b>

"Why don't we have the older sister take care of it? Then no one can interfere. If we hide at the base until the time on the notice passes, it will be even more perfect."

"Are you a genius? It's a complete shutout."

<b>

To come up with such an idea in such a short time.

Cute and smart, Dear-kun is really amazing. I like him.

<b>

...Ah, no! I like him as a friend! It's a friend-like love, okay!?

Wait, who am I making excuses to!?

<b>

"Older sister? Are you okay?"

"Uh, yeah! I'm fine! That's a great idea, as expected of Dear-kun!"

"How about we let the Phantom Thief Hermes pass for now and negotiate again later?"

"Alright, let's go with that!"

<b>

It's also a postponement of the problem, but if we can get past Hermes, Mi-chan's circumstances might change somehow!

<b>

<b>

<b>

I wrapped up the whispering conversation and told Mi-chan about Dear-kun's idea.

<b>

"So, I was thinking of taking care of it on my end."

"Ah, since there's the magic pouch made by Amber, Karichan would be suitable. That's true."

<b>

Mi-chan nodded in agreement.

<b>

"Lord Vermilion, there is a possibility that these guys are connected to Hermes! I wonder if it's wise to trust them."

"Silence. I trust Karichan."

<b>

Mi-chan silenced the bearded aide with a single shout. I can't help but think my trust is a bit too high, though.

In reality, I'm also aiming to retrieve the divine artifact, so the bearded guy's concerns aren't entirely unfounded.

<b>

"On top of that, let's have Hermes grab a fake."

<b>

Dear-kun said with a smile.

Oh? What’s this? Did he come up with something additional?

<b>

"…Are you saying we should make a replica of the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer' and leave it in its place?"

"Yes. We'll secretly create a lookalike and leave it there instead. Oh, but that alone might raise suspicion. How about we have a dragon guard it to reduce their thinking space? Arthur, can you do that? I want you to let them steal it on purpose."

『Ah, yeah. Sis, that's fine, right?』

"Of course. You can do whatever you want, Dear-kun."

<b>

It seems like he's planning to make Arthur work too. That's fine, go ahead and use him.

Meanwhile, Mi-chan's aide is surprised to see Arthur talking with a vocabulary book. I guess Mi-chan isn't surprised because she has already seen Arthur in the village?

<b>

"A treasure guarded by a dragon, huh? That certainly has enough persuasive power to make the fake look like the real thing."

"However, the key will be whether we can prepare the replica. What do you think?"

"No problem, I'll have it ready by tomorrow morning. ...Well, it might be a bit rough, but I'll help out too."

<b>

While it might take a long time to conceal it, it seems that having a craftsman help out during the time we deceive Hermes and dodge the notice will keep their mouths shut. Wow, that's capable.

<b>

By the way, are you asking if I can quickly make a copy? Sorry, but the divine artifacts are resistant to time-space magic.

<b>

Dear-kun and Mi-chan are happily chatting away. What a sight for sore eyes.

<b>

"…Well, at least if the older sister takes care of it, Hermes won't be able to interfere at that point. Who would imagine that a passing human is taking care of a national treasure of the dwarves?"

"That's true. Then come back tomorrow morning. We'll quickly switch it out and have Karichan take care of it."

"Got it, Mi-chan. Oh, then I'll lend Arthur-kun for security in the meantime."

『If it's Sis's request, I can't refuse. I'll do my best!』

"Yeah, thanks, Arthur-kun. ...Are your scales okay? They were pretty much pulled out."

『I'm fine! I appreciate your concern!』

<b>

Mi-chan bowed her head to Arthur-kun, who was talking with a vocabulary book.

Ah, I guess they had already met when they messed up at the banquet.

<b>

『Oh. By the way, Sis, can I go back to my original size? I think that would be more intimidating.』

"That's true. Oh, Mi-chan. Is it okay for Arthur-kun to grow bigger?"

"Uh, yeah? That's fine, but... huh? You're going to get bigger?"

<b>

Now that I have Mi-chan's permission, I remove the collar's restrictions.

Arthur-kun grew in size. When he expanded to the size of a car and spread his wings, the surroundings gasped.

<b>

『Gyao... Gaw Gaw』

"Huh? Oh, sorry, can you say that again?"

<b>

Arthur-kun, without the vocabulary book, made some noises softly.

Since he had been using the vocabulary book lately, I had turned off his dragon language skill. I turned it back on to listen again.

<b>

『It's hard to hold the vocabulary book when I get bigger... That was a blind spot.』

"Ah, right. It does change size."

『I want a bigger vocabulary book too. It's more fun to be able to talk about various things.』

"I'll make one for you next time."

『Thanks a lot!』

<b>

Thus, by the next morning, a replica of the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer' was indeed completed, and we went through the farce of having the Phantom Thief Hermes steal it.

<b>

...Yes, the replica that I marked!

Now, who was it that tried to steal the treasure from Mi-chan?
