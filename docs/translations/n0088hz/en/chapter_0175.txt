# Deere's secret plan

<blank>

Dia's secret plan against the thief Hermes. It's--

<blank>

<blank>

She said, "Your sister should take care of it. Then no one can touch them. It would be even more perfect if you hid in the base until the time of the notice expires."

What a genius. That's a perfect game."

<blank>

I can't believe you came up with such an idea in such a short time.

She's cute and smart, Dia, she's amazing. I like you.

<blank>

...... Oh, no!　As a friend!　I like you as a friend!

I mean, who am I to make excuses!

<blank>

"Sister?　Are you okay?"

I'll be fine!　It's all right!　Good idea, Dia-kun!

How about we just let the thief Hermes get away with it and negotiate again at a later date?"

Okay, let's go with that!"

<blank>

It may be a postponement of the problem, but if we can make it through Hermes, Mi-chan's situation may somehow change and she may be able to manage!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I cut off the whispering and told Mee-chan about Dear's idea.

<blank>

So, I thought I'd keep it on my end."

Ahh. We have a magic pouch that Amber made, and Kari is the right person for the job. Certainly."

<blank>

Mee nodded, "Yeah, yeah.

<blank>

There is a possibility that they are connected to Hermes, Mr. Vermillion!　We should not trust them."

Shut up. I believe in Kari."

<blank>

Mee-chan silences the aide-like mustache with a blackmail. I'm too trusting, aren't I?　I think so.

In fact, I'm also trying to recover the sacred artifacts, so I'm not mistaken in my concern about what the beard says.

<blank>

Then let Hermes grab the fake."

<blank>

Dia-kun says smiling.

Oh?　What is it? Did you come up with something extra?

<blank>

"You mean you're going to make a replica of the ...... 'Breaking Wall Hammer' and put it in its place?"

Yes," he said. In secret, we will make a counterfeit that looks exactly like it and place it in its place. Oh, if that's all you do, they might get suspicious. How about having the dragon guard it, to give us less time to think about it?　Arthur, would you do it?　I'd like you to let me steal it on purpose."

'Oh, yes. Miss, it's okay, right?"

Mochi. Dear, you can do whatever you want."

<blank>

Arthur, it looks like you are going to make him work too. It's OK - give him a job.

And casually, Mee-chan's entourage is surprised to see Arthur conversing with a vocabulary book. On the other hand, Mee-chan is not surprised because she had already seen Arthur in the village?

<blank>

The treasure of the dragon's guardianship, huh? Surely that's convincing enough to make a fake look real."

It's just a matter of being able to prepare a facsimile." What do you think?"

No problem, we'll have it ready by tomorrow morning. ...... Well, it'll be a little rough, but we'll help you out."

<blank>

He said that if he had to cover it up for a long period of time, he could at least keep the mouths of the artisans who helped him quiet while he misled Hermes and scuttled the notice. Wow, competent.

<blank>

By the way, why don't I just make a quick copy?　Sorry, the sacred artifact is resistant to space-time magic.

<blank>

Dia-kun and Mi-chan are having a friendly conversation. I'm so happy to see them.

<blank>

"...... Well, at least once your sister takes custody of it, you can't touch the Hermes at that point. Who would have guessed that a Dwarven national treasure would be in the custody of a passerby?"

Sure. Then come back tomorrow morning. I'll swap it out there and have Kari take care of it.

I'll lend you Arthur to guard you while I'm gone. I'll lend you Mr. Arthur for security in the meantime.

If it's a request from Miss, I can't help it. Thank you!

'Yes, nice to meet you, Arthur. Are your ...... scales okay?　I was picked back up quite a bit."

I'm fine!　I'm sorry for your concern!

<blank>

Mee-chan bows her head to Arthur, who is conversing with a vocabulary book.

Ah, I knew we had already met each other when we got into it at the sake party.

<blank>

Oh, yes, Miss. Oh, that's right, Miss. Can I go back to my original size?　I think you look more intimidating that way.

Sure. Oh, Mee-chan. Arthur, can I get big?"

What?　Okay, but. ...... Eh?　It's going to be big?"

<blank>

With Mee's permission, I'll remove the restrictions on the collar.

Arthur's size increased dramatically. Arthur spread his wings and everyone around him gasped as he became the size of a car.

<blank>

'Gyao ...... ga ga ga ga.'

"Hmm?　Oh, sorry, say it again."

<blank>

Arthur, who is not holding a vocabulary book, makes some kind of noise in a whisper.

I had been using a vocabulary book for the past few days, so I had turned off my dragon language skills. Turn it on and listen again.

<blank>

I'm not comfortable holding a vocabulary book when it's big. ...... This was a blind spot.

'Ahh. It changes size."

I want a big vocabulary book, too. It's more fun to have a conversation.

I'll make it for you sometime."

Thank you.

<blank>

Thus, the next morning, a replica of the "Breaking Wall Hammer" was indeed completed, and the thief, Hermes, was forced to steal it, a travesty.

<blank>

...... Yes, I marked the imitations, you know, the ones I marked!

Now, I wonder who tried to steal the treasure from Mee-chan?

<blank>
