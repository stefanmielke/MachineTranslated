# Let's Go to the Port Town of Verald!

<b>

<b>

The road to getting a beautiful girl slave was far and rugged...

Even making money is tough when lumberjacks are banned... In that case, I have no choice but to take on another request.

Hmm, I wonder if there are any monster subjugation requests? Kobolds, wolves, slimes... rampaging fire horses? Is the horse on fire? Is that a thing?

<b>

"By the way, Karina, weren't you asked by Sister Harumikazuchi to do some shopping?"

"Oh. Now that you mention it, that's right."

<b>

Oh no, I almost forgot. How could I let that slip!

In that case, I want to take on a delivery request to the port town of Verald, where I can stock up on the lotion that Sati-chan told me about, including for my merchant activities.

<b>

"Wait, with that huge backpack on your back, and camping gear packed in, do you really have room to carry anything else? I'm not worried about the weight, though."

"Ah, um... I wonder if I could buy a cart used by lumberjacks?"

"If you give me a large copper coin, I might negotiate for you. It should be around a medium silver coin, and it shouldn't be more than a large silver coin."

<b>

That's great. I should order it while I have some money from lumberjacking.

I don't really need a cart since I have storage magic, but if someone asks, "Then how did you carry this?" it would be hard to answer. Having a cart shouldn't be a problem for me.

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, I paid one medium silver coin and one large copper coin for a cart, thanks to Blade-senpai's negotiation skills, I also got some rope and a rain cover as a bonus, so I'm quite pleased.

With this, I can say, "I used this to carry most things."

<b>

By the way, this cloth alone seems like it would normally cost about two silver coins, right? Is that okay?

<b>

"Since you're going to be a great merchant in the future, I told him it would be good to build some goodwill now. He already knew about the lumberjack story, so he accepted it without issue."

<b>

As expected of senpai, a master negotiator.

I have to earn a lot to avoid making senpai a liar!

<b>

"Ah. You're going to camp on the way, right? You should also prepare a scavenger slime."

"Ah, yeah, I need to gather some small items too."

"While we're at it, I'll help you out. Buy various things. Do you need clothes?"

"Oh, I'm fine on that front. I have a stock."

<b>

I can replicate clothes, so it's not a problem.

In fact, after being stripped by Sister Harumikazuchi at the beginning, I've been wearing replicas while keeping the original safe. Once I wear them out, I just copy them!

<b>

"Then, it's small items and food. The climate in Verald is similar to here, so... alright. Follow me, I know a good shop."

<b>

So, led by the caring Blade-senpai, we went shopping.

Using my lumberjack rewards generously, I bought personal scavenger slimes, tents, and even incense to ward off monsters (it's just a comfort, but better than nothing), as well as cooking utensils.

<b>

"Hey, Karina, can I trade this for a bottle of alcohol?"

"Sure. In fact, it helps that my backpack is lighter... Wait, is it really just one bottle of alcohol!? That's a frying pan!?"

"Ah, then make it two bottles. If you throw in this and that, it'll be even."

"Whoa, can I really get good oil too? Seriously? Thank you so much!"

<b>

In this way, we exchanged items and gathered everything at a good deal, and my backpack started to have some empty space. Wow, senpai is really good at shopping.

<b>

"Normally, you wouldn't buy this much unless you had a cart. But with your magic to lighten logs, you should manage somehow, right?"

"Yeah. Hehe, my standard of living is going to go way up... By the way, senpai, aren't you more suited to being a merchant than an adventurer?"

"Are you stupid? I just know a lot of people. My connections are only in this town."

<b>

I got nudged. Well, it's true that senpai is too kind-hearted to be cut out for being a merchant.

If Sati-chan got involved, she'd probably strip me of everything by the next day.

<b>

"Your good looks also helped you get a good deal."

"Wow! Being beautiful is such an advantage! Hehehe."

"And speaking of which, is that beauty going to post a request for a bodyguard? I could take it if you want."

<b>

Well, I could trust senpai and the others to take the request...

<b>

"Hmm, as tempting as it is, I think I'll try going alone this time. I have a few things I want to do."

"I see. Normally, I would stop you, but it's you after all. Just make sure to come back safely."

"Got it, thanks for everything!"

<b>

So, with the delivery request's cargo and a large backpack filled with alcohol loaded onto the cart, I left the first town, Sorashidore.

I used the merchant guild's guild card for the first time! Yay!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"This record of leaving Sorashidore is from noon today. That's too early; it must be a fake."

"Ah-hin...!?"

I'm Karina! Right now, I'm at the gate of the port town of Verald!

I didn't know! The merchant guild's guild card records the date of entry and exit from the town!

<b>

"Is that a merchant guild's guild card? Is it possible for it to be forged?"

"It's right in front of you... The cargo matches the guild card. The quantity is also fine."

"Isn't this from an adventurer guild request? So, are you also involved in that?"

"Either way, this is a big problem. We can't make a judgment. Hey, contact the higher-ups and the guild—"

"Everyone! Please, look over here!"

<b>

I held up my five-yen coin fake hypnosis ID. The soldiers surrounding me softened their expressions.

<b>

"...Ah, I see. If you had shown that from the beginning. Alright, you are permitted to enter the town."

"Ah, wait, wait! That's fine for now. I'm going back for a bit!"

"Hmm? But it's work..."

"Attention! Please, based on this ID, somehow let me through!"

"I see. Understood."

<b>

That was close! That was really close. Ah, I was surprised. I was super panicking.

You see, I was going to teleport to the sky, right? Then I was going to search for the port town of Verald from the sky, right? I was going to go, right? I was going to try to enter through the gate confidently, right? I showed the guild card, and this happened.

<b>

Also, it seems there was a record of the cargo on the guild card.

Wow, that's some high-tech feature! The merchant guild's guild card! Is it for tax purposes!?

<b>

I'm glad I kept that fake ID. I'm so relieved I didn't return it to the gods. After all, it's important to keep essential items.

<b>

"Damn it, what should I do? I haven't done anything wrong..."

<b>

At this rate, I can't enter the town. Well, I could force my way in, but since there's a record of entry and exit, I wouldn't be able to use the guild card or ID inside.

No, let's think of it the other way around. I'm glad I didn't get caught for "illegal entry!" after entering the town and using the guild card.

<b>

"...I guess I have no choice but to kill some time for about five days."

<b>

In short, the problem was that I arrived too early, and if I just wait until it feels like a normal time, there won't be any issues.

<b>

Well, I’ll take it as a vacation and relax.
