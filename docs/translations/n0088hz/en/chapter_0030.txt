# Let's go to the port town of Velarde!

<blank>

<blank>

The road to getting a beautiful slave girl was far, far away and steep. ......

I can't believe that the lumberjacks are enclosed to make money. ...... If this happens, I'll just have to take another request.

Hmmm, do we have a request to take down?　Kobolds and wolves and slimes ...... abusive fire horses?　The horse is on fire? Is there anything like that?

<blank>

I thought Miss Karina had asked Miss Harumikazuchi to do some shopping for you."

Oh. That reminds me."

<blank>

Oh, man, I almost forgot. I almost forgot what I did!

If that is the case, I would like to accept a delivery request to the port town of Velarde, where I can purchase the lotion that Sati-tan taught me, including peddling.

<blank>

I mean, how can you carry a backpack that big, with all that camping gear in it, and still have room to carry anything on top of it?　I'm not worried about the weight.

'Oh, um, ...... yeah, can't we buy one of those carts you used in the lumberjacks?'

Give me a large copper coin and I'll negotiate with you. Maybe a medium silver coin, but not a large silver coin.

<blank>

Thanks. I'll ask for it now that I'm a lumberjack and my pocketbook is warm.

It's not really necessary because of the storage magic, but it's hard to answer the question, "Then how did you transport all this stuff?" I would have no trouble with having a cart. I would have no trouble with a cart.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, I paid one medium silver coin and Braid senior's reward was also one large copper coin to purchase one cart. Thanks to his negotiation, we also received a free rope and a cloth to protect us from the rain, so we were very happy.

With this, you can say "I used this to transport most things".

<blank>

I mean, this cloth alone would normally cost about 2 silver coins, right?　Are you sure?

<blank>

I told him that she was a young lady who was going to be a great merchant in the future and that he should sell his debt to her while he still could. Of course he knew about the woodcutter's story, and he usually agreed with me.

<blank>

Quite a senior, good negotiator.

I have to earn a lot of money to keep my seniors from being liars!

<blank>

Oh, you're going to stay in the field on the way, aren't you? We'll be camping out along the way, won't we?　Better get some scavenger slime ready."

"Oh, I'll have to get all those little things, too."

I'll help you out. "I'll help you out. Do you need clothes or anything?"

I'm fine with that. We have stock."

<blank>

As for the clothes, it's all about replication.

In fact, since the first time Sister Harumikazuchi stripped me of my clothes, I've been saving the originals and wearing duplicates. When I wear it down, I just copy it!

<blank>

'Well, then, small stuff and food. The climate in Velarde is not so different from here. ...... Follow me, I know a good place."

<blank>

So, taken by the caring senior Braid, we went shopping for various things.

We spent a lot of lumberjack rewards to buy personal scavenger slime, tents, and so on. Incense to ward off demons (better than nothing) and cooking utensils were also purchased.

<blank>

Hey Karina, can I trade this for a bottle of booze?"

It's fine. I'd rather have an empty backpack. ...... is that just one bottle of sake?　It's a frying pan!

"Oh, two bottles, then. And if you add this one and this one, we'll make even.

"Oooh, oil is good too?　Seriously?　Ohhhh thank you!"

<blank>

Sometimes we barter with each other in this way, and we get a good deal and free up space in our backpacks. You're a great shopper, senpai.

<blank>

I would not normally buy so many unless I had a horse-drawn carriage. But you can do magic to make the logs lighter, can't you?"

I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get a good deal on a new house. I'm sure your standard of living is going to improve a lot. ......, or perhaps you're more suited to being a merchant than an adventurer?"

I just know a lot of people here. And this is the only town where I have a good face."

<blank>

I was poked. Well, it's true that senpai is too good-natured to be a merchant.

If Sati-tan gets a hold of me, I'm going to be picked off my ass the next day.

<blank>

Your good looks were a factor in getting me a good deal."

She said, "Well!　Beautiful women are a bargain!　Mm-hmm."

He said, "So, come to think of it, is that beautiful woman going to offer you a request for an escort?　I'll take it."

<blank>

Hmm, I'd feel comfortable requesting them if they were seniors, though: ......

<blank>

I'll go alone this time. I have some things I want to do."

I see. Normally I would stop you, but it's you. Come home safe."

I'm so grateful for everything you've done for me!　Aazus!"

<blank>

So, with a large backpack full of liquor on the cart, along with my delivery order, I left Solashidore, the first town I visited.

I used my merchant guild certificate for the first time!　Yay!

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

<blank>

This Solacidore Demachi record must be noon today. Too early, must be a fake."

AHIN......!"

<blank>

My name is Karina!　I'm at the gate of the port town of Velarde!

I didn't hear that!　I can't believe that the merchants guild guild card records the entry and exit of towns, including the date!

<blank>

"A guild certificate from the Merchant's Guild?　How could it possibly be forged?"

'It's right in front of you in reality. The ...... load matches the one on the guild certificate. The numbers are fine."

"You're the Adventurers' Guild, aren't you?　You're in on it, too, aren't you?

Either way, it's a big problem. We can't make a decision. Hey, we'll check with the top and the guilds.

"Hello, everyone!　Look this way, look this way!

<blank>

I held up a five-yen coin counterfeit hypnotic ID card. The eyes of the soldiers who had surrounded me and were talking with me became kind.

<blank>

You said, "...... Oh, what the heck. If you could just get that out of the way from the beginning. Okay, we'll give you permission to come in too."

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　That can wait until next time. I'm leaving for now!"

"Mm?　But it's work. ......"

Chooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　ID, somehow in spare of this ID!"

I see. Okay."

<blank>

Oh, man!　This is so bad. Oh, I was so surprised. I was in a big hurry.

No, you know, we're going to take to the sky, right?　You look for the port town of Velarde from the sky, right?　You go there, right?　You try to get in through the gate with dignity, right?　You showed your guild card, right?　This is it.

<blank>

I mean, they said that there was a record on the guild certificate about the luggage as well.

Wow, what a high-tech feature!　What about the merchant guild's guild certificate?　Taxation!

<blank>

Good thing there was a fake ID. I'm glad I didn't return it to God. I guess you should keep important items.

<blank>

I've done nothing wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. ......

<blank>

I can't enter the town like this. No, you can enter on your own if you want to, but as long as your entry and exit are recorded, you can't use your guild card or ID card inside.

No, let's think backwards here. I'm glad I didn't go into town without permission and use my guild card and then make a fuss about it. I'm glad I didn't have to make a fuss about it.

<blank>

...... no choice, I'll just kill time for 5 days or so."

<blank>

In short, the problem was that the time was too early, and there is no problem if you wait until a normal, uncomfortable time.

<blank>

Well, I'll just think of it as a vacation and take it easy.
