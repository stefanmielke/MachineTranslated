# This woman is crazy. (Bibei's perspective)

<b>

<b>

<b>

Inside the dungeon, we were captured by cowardly means.

So cowardly that I can't even understand what happened.

<b>

However, since everyone is together, I'm sure we can manage somehow.

<b>

Still, this is an unusually beautiful prison... When did they build such a prison inside the dungeon?

<b>

"Fufufufu... How do you feel?"

<b>

The robed man who was with Shirogane came and looked down at us, tied up and rolling around in the prison. He's a suspicious, overly suspicious man.

<b>

"…This is the worst. What the hell is going on?"

"What? You're a terrorist trying to destroy the dungeon. We captured you alive. It's a simple story, isn't it?"

"I'm going to be a hero."

"So you're definitely a terrorist, right?"

<b>

Hmph, he snorts in laughter.

<b>

"Now, as for your treatment... let's see. I'll torture you appropriately."

"Huh? T-torture?"

<b>

What is he saying? I'm going to be a hero, you know!?

<b>

"Well then, let me introduce you to the torturer who will take care of you from now on. Wait a moment."

<b>

The man whose face I couldn't see said that and temporarily left in front of the cell, returning with a woman.

A beautiful woman with black hair.

<b>

"This is your caretaker. Well then."

<b>

The man said just that and left. ...Are they leaving just this woman with us? If so, maybe I can charm her with my sweet looks.

<b>

"Hey, why don't you become my woman? I'm going to be a hero, you know?"

"Dream on. Mashiro-san is a million times cooler."

<b>

I was easily rejected. Huh, why?

I'm definitely better than that beast, right??? This woman is crazy.

<b>

"Then let's get started, torture!"

<b>

...And finally, the torture began.

<b>

"I-I don't know anything! If you're going to do it, you should do it to the four behind me."

"Huh? The fact that you're so willing to throw your friends under the bus is super uncool and really off-putting."

<b>

What are you talking about? This is just using the right person for the right job.

When it comes to torture, it should involve painful things, right? My friends seem to have trained to endure pain, and their pain sensitivity is said to be very dull.

<b>

Besides, I really can't say anything!

<b>

<b>

"You're really a puppet, huh? Well, don't worry. I don't really want to extract anything from you... After all, you're just a spy sent by the Empire and a puppet from the Holy Nation, right? So what more do you want to confirm?"

"Huh? W-well, how about the treatment that was supposed to be given to the hero?"

"Ahaha. You're probably being fed lies. The information from the puppet is completely unreliable."

<b>

W-what?

<b>

"By the way, let me tell you one thing first. Even though it's called torture, I won't be hurting your bodies. You're going to be handed over to the guild, so don't worry? ...Well, if I even put a scratch on Mashiro-san, I would have cut off as many body parts as there are scratches, hehehe."

<b>

Huh, well, that's good?

Hmm?

<b>

"If you're not going to hurt us, then what exactly are you planning to do? ...Hah! You’re not going to do something lewd, are you?"

"Well, don't talk nonsense? Well, everyone will have to strip and change, though."

<b>

Saying that, the woman entered the cell and took out something small.

What is that...? A pacifier? The kind that babies suck on. Huh, what are you going to do with that?

<b>

"Let's make you all pretty, okay? Hehehe."

"Mmmph!?"

<b>

A pacifier was shoved into my mouth. The other four got the same treatment.

...!? What is this? There's a strange sensation in my mouth. My mouth is automatically sucking on the pacifier...!?

<b>

"B-babuu—babuu!?"

"Oh, it worked. As expected of that person's magical tool."

<b>

What I wanted to say was "What did you do?" but the words that came out of my mouth were "babuu."

My words are being erased without my consent! It's my own body!

<b>

"B-bab, babuu...!"

<b>

My jaw, my tongue, my cheeks won't listen to me! What is this!?

<b>

"As I said earlier, we don't actually want any information from you. Please do that kind of thing after you're handed over to the guild. ...Now then, what’s about to start is punishment for pointing a gun at Mashiro-san! You better regret it!"

<b>

N-no way... S-stop! Please, not this!

I'm going to be a hero, you know!? That cloth in your hand is—it's a "diaper," isn't it!?!?
