# She's crazy, this woman. (Beebay viewpoint)

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the dungeon, we were caught by cowardly means.

It's such a cowardly measure that I don't know what happened.

<blank>

However, that said, we are all in this together, we will make it.

<blank>

It's still a very beautiful prison. ...... When did they build such a prison in a dungeon?

<blank>

Foffoffoffoff...... how are you feeling?"

<blank>

The robed man who was with Shirogane comes over and looks down at us as we are tied up and rolled inside the prison. He is a suspicious, too suspicious man.

<blank>

I'm like, "...... sucks. What's going on here?

What, you're a terrorist trying to destroy a dungeon. We took it alive. Simple enough, right?"

I am the man who will be brave.

I mean, you're sure he's a terrorist, right?"

<blank>

Hmph, they snicker at me.

<blank>

Now, as for what to do with you guys, ...... I guess so. Let's torture you appropriately."

What?　Torture?"

<blank>

What are you saying? I'm the man who will be brave!

<blank>

I'll introduce you to the torturers who are going to take care of you. Just a moment.

<blank>

The faceless man then left the prison for a time and returned with a woman.

She is dark-haired and good-looking.

<blank>

This is your caretaker. See you."

<blank>

The man said that much and left. Do you want to ...... just this woman?　Then, with my sweet mask, I might be able to lock her up.

<blank>

Hey, will you be my woman? I'm the guy who's going to be brave.

He said, "Sleepyhead. And Mr. Masiello is a million times cooler."

<blank>

It was easily rejected. Well, why?

Of course I'm better than that beast, right?　She's crazy.

<blank>

Let's do it then, torture!"

<blank>

...... and finally the torture began.

<blank>

I don't know anything about it!　If you want to do it, you can do it with the four guys back there."

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it. It's so uncool when he offers up his friends without hesitation.

<blank>

I don't know what you are talking about, this is called the right place for the right person.

When you say torture, you mean doing something painful, right?　It seems that my fellow workers are trained to endure pain, and their sense of pain is very dull.

<blank>

Besides, I can't really talk about anything!

<blank>

<blank>

I'm really a puppet, aren't I? Well, don't worry. I don't have anything to ask you. ...... is just a spy sent by the Empire and a puppet from the Holy Land, right? What more do you want to know?

What?　Yuh, like the treatment you were supposed to get as a brave warrior?"

Ha-ha-ha. I'm sure that's a lie. You can't rely on any information from a puppet.

<blank>

What, because?

<blank>

'Yes, I'll tell you one thing first. Torture does not mean physical harm. You guys are supposed to be handed over to the guild, don't worry? ...... Well, if I had given even one scratch to Mr. Masiro, I would have cut off as many body parts as the number of scratches he had.

<blank>

Eh, oh, that's good?

Hmm?

<blank>

'If you're not going to hurt me, what the hell are you going to do? ...... Ha!　Don't tell me you're going to do something naughty!

"Hmmm, talk in your sleep, huh?　Well, I'm going to have to strip you all down and change."

<blank>

Saying this, the woman entered the prison and took out something small.

What's that? ...... pacifier?　The kind babies suck on. What are you going to do with it?

<blank>

Boku-chan, let's get all dolled up.

Mugg!"

<blank>

They shoved a pacifier in my mouth. So were four others.

......!　What's this, my mouth feels strange. My mouth sucked the pacifier by itself and ......!

<blank>

Baba-babu-babu?

"Oh, it's a success. That's his magical tool!"

<blank>

What I tried to say was "what did you do" and the word that came out of my mouth was "bubu".

The words are being erased without my permission!　Even though it's my body!

<blank>

Bah, bah, bub ......

<blank>

My jaw, my tongue, my cheeks don't listen to me!　What the hell is this?

<blank>

As I said before, we don't have any information we want to know from you. You can do that kind of thing at the place where we handed you over to the guild. ...... Now, what's about to begin is your punishment for pointing a gun at Mr. Masiello!　You'll be sorry at best!"

<blank>

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　Don't, don't, don't do this!

I'm the man who will be brave!　That cloth in your hand--isn't that a "diaper" aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
