# Let's stretch more

<b>

<b>

With a whoosh, a bronze-colored dragon flew in.

It's not Kirigon. It's her, Galudora-chan.

<b>

"Hey! I brought a human since there were some at the cliff like Karina said!"

"Hey, Galudora-chan. What's up, thanks for your hard work."

<b>

I waved my hand to invite Galudora-chan to the square, but the ogres and the mercenaries who attacked the village I captured were in a state of panic.

After all, a new dragon appeared, holding two humans. ...Are they alive but not moving? Oh, just unconscious? Then that's fine.

<b>

To ensure we could communicate in advance, I lent my tamed Slabe to Galudora-chan and had it stick to her claws.

With this, I sent a message through the slime saying, "There was a suspicious guy, so capture them."

<b>

The gem-like decoration was because Galudora thought it would make her happy. In fact, she was really happy. Her mood was sky-high.

If anything, it might be nice to decorate with real gems next time as a reward. She must have some treasure or two like a dragon.

Dragon Nail Artist, Karina-chan.

<b>

Huh? The reward for Kirigon? I'm letting you off without taking your life, so be grateful.

<b>

...You say the treatment of the two is too different?

Karina-chan is kind to cute ones! If you want kindness, show some cuteness! Come on! Learn from Dia-kun!

<b>

"Hey, is that Karina's favorite child over there? So cute with those fluttering things!"

"Oh, my honey came too. By the way, this is the sister's girl, Dia-kun-chan!"

"Whoa! Dia-kun-chan!! That's quite a long name!"

<b>

"…Nice to meet you, um. Arthur, what’s this dragon's name?"

"That's Galudora-san, Kirigon-san's mate. Um, she says to say hi to Dia-kun-chan."

"I see. Nice to meet you, Galudora-san."

"Yeah! Nice to meet you, Dia-kun-chan-chan!"

<b>

Dia-kun can only converse with Arthur, who uses a vocabulary book, so she doesn't understand Galudora's words...

<b>

"Galudora-chan. Just to let you know, Dia-kun's name is just 'Dia,' okay?"

"What!? It's so long, that's hilarious! Let's stretch it more. How about Dia-kun-chan-san-sama?"

<b>

Galudora laughed joyfully, thumping her tail on the ground.

Her massive body did that, so both the ogres and the merchants and mercenaries were all scared. Well, it's only natural since her tail could easily kill an average person.

If I didn't have spatial magic, I'd be the first to run away and keep my distance.

<b>

Youki-chan timidly asks Dia-kun.

<b>

"Um, um, Priestess. What is this new dragon?"

"Oh, um... She's Kirigon-san's mate. As long as we don't oppose her, she shouldn't attack us. ...It seems she was keeping watch outside the village."

"That's right! And the ones I found were these guys!"

"Wow, I see... Thank you."

<b>

Two merchants (unconscious) were shoved forward. ...Since they attacked us, we obviously have to make them pay—wait, I'm thinking like a dragon. Well, that's fine.

<b>

Huh? What's that, mercenary boy?

...You say "If I had seen the dragon, I wouldn't have attacked"?

If you guys hadn't attacked us, there wouldn't have been any need for payback, so it's mutual. Be prepared to be squeezed without mercy! (Of course, in a financial sense)
