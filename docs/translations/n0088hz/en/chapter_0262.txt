# Stretch it further

A copper-brown dragon flew by.

It's not Kirigon. It's that girlfriend, Galdra-chan.

<blank>

I found a ningen on the cliff as Carina said, so I brought him here!　Just like Karina said, there was a ningen on the cliff, so I brought him here.

"Oh, Galdra-chan. Oh, hey, good job."

<blank>

I fluttered my hand and invited Galdra-chan into the square, but the demon tribe and the mercenaries who had attacked the village we had captured by the way were aghast.

At any rate, a new dragon appeared with two humans in its grip. ...... It's not moving, but is it alive?　Oh, just stunned?　If so, good.

<blank>

I had lent my tamed Slavee to Galdra-chan and stuck it to her fingernails so that we could contact each other beforehand.

This is how I contacted him via slime, saying, 'I saw a suspicious guy, catch him.

<blank>

The reason it is hardened like jewelry is because Galdra thought it would make him happy. In fact, he was very happy. He was very excited.

If you want, you can decorate it with real gems next time as a reward for this time. They probably have a treasure or two, just like dragons.

She is a dragon nail artist, Karina.

<blank>

Huh?　A reward for Kirigon?　You're doing this without taking your own life, so be thankful.

<blank>

...... that the two are treated too differently?

She's a sweet girl, Carina, who is kind to pretty girls!　If you want me to be nice to you, show me your cuteness!　Hey!　Take a lesson from Dia-kun!

<blank>

'Oh, is that Karina's little bikini over there?　She's so cute and fluttery!

'Oh, my honey, you're here too? Oh, yes, this is Miss Missy's woman, Miss Dia-kun-chan!'

'Hohey!　Dia-kun-chan-san!　That's quite a long name!

<blank>

"...... Nice to meet you, um. Arthur, what's your name, Mr. Koch's Dragon?"

I'm Gyal Dora-san, Kirigon-san's guy. Well, he says hello to Dia-kun-chan.

I see. Pleased to meet you, Mr. Gardola."

I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea!　Nice to meet you, Dia-kun-chan and Sanchan-chan!"

<blank>

The only person Mr. Dear can converse with is Arthur, who uses a vocabulary book, so he doesn't understand Galdra's language. ......

<blank>

'Galdra-chan. Just so you know, Dia, your name is just 'Dia', okay?"

I'm so excited!　You're adding so much, it's hilarious!　Let's extend it more. Let's extend it even further, like Dia-kun chan san san san sama?

<blank>

Galdra smiles happily as she slaps her tail on the ground.

The ogre tribe, merchants, and mercenaries are all scared to death because of such a huge body. Well, it's a tail that can kill an ordinary person if it hits him or her, so it's only natural.

If I didn't have spatial magic, I'd be the first to run away and keep my distance.

<blank>

Yoki-chan asks Dia-kun fearfully.

<blank>

Oh, um, Miko-sama. What is this new dragon over here?"

Oh. Let's see, ...... I'm Mr. Kirigon's tugai. I thought they wouldn't attack if we didn't antagonize them. It seems he's been keeping an eye on us outside of our ...... village."

That's right. And then we found these guys!

"Hiyah, I see... ...... Oh, thank you."

<blank>

Two merchants (in a stupor) who were offered to us. I'm not sure what to make of this, but I'm sure they'll be happy to help. ...... Since they attacked us, of course we'll have to make them pay for it. I'm not sure what to make of it, but it's okay.

<blank>

Hmm?　What is it, Mr. Mercenary?

...... "If I had seen the dragon was there, I wouldn't have attacked it"?

If you hadn't attacked us here, we wouldn't have had to deal with the consequences, so it's on both of us. We will squeeze you mercilessly, so be prepared! (In a financial sense, of course.)
