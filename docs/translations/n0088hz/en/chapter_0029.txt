# A Grown-Up Shopping Story - Continuation

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. When I asked my senior, "I want to buy a slave, but what's it like?" I was confronted with a terrible reality!

But on top of that, he said, "For someone solo like you, having a slave is an option," what does that mean?

He’s shaking my heart, what does he want me to do! Blade-senpai, seriously!

<b>

Well, enough of the jokes.

<b>

"I thought you were against having a slave based on the flow of the conversation."

"It's about the purpose. If it's for erotic or pet purposes, that's one thing. If you’re going to make them work properly as a slave, that's different."

"W-What proof do you have that I’m doing it for erotic purposes!?"

<b>

I’m a girl, you know!? Pure and innocent!

<b>

"Shut up, it’s pointless to cover up now, Karina. You had the same look in your eyes as Shildon back then."

"Yeah, I could tell right away that if I didn’t threaten you hard, you’d be deceived."

"…Did I really have such an obvious look?"

<b>

I can't even argue back!

<b>

"Well, if you think about it, it’s clear that decent people who can work for erotic purposes end up in brothels, right? The ones who look good and are still around are definitely the bad ones."

"Th-That’s true!?"

<b>

Slaves have no right to refuse.

And since those in that line of work are fishing for them, there’s no way decent slaves are left.

If there are, it’s a miracle. Or they’re illegal slaves that would get you caught if you owned them.

<b>

Conversely, you might still get a better deal with regular slaves.

Of course, the good ones sell out quickly, so if you’re late, you’ll only get the bad ones, but since there are still some good ones mixed in, it’s still better.

<b>

"So, if you treat them as companions or servants, slaves are better. Especially since you seem to have a lot of secrets."

"Oh, you noticed after all?"

<b>

I’m not actively hiding them or anything.

<b>

"Well, I won’t pry. That’s what being an adventurer is about."

"Actually, I’m a messenger of the gods."

"I told you not to pry! Don’t say that!? Are you trying to drag me in!?"

<b>

Tch. I thought I could get help with collecting divine artifacts or something.

<b>

"Let’s get back to the topic. Slaves are bound by various curses. One of them is to keep secrets. If they try to reveal a secret, their body, including their voice, won’t move."

"Oh, so if I say, 'Keep it a secret,' I can relax, right?"

"That’s right. Merchants often have many secrets, so they’re useful as workers."

<b>

It’s true that employees who keep secrets are convenient.

<b>

"However, keep in mind that most slaves sold are those who fell into slavery due to wrongdoing or debt. The idea that 'my slave will be fine' is a naive thought; from the slave's perspective, you’re just a walking wallet."

"…They are useful, but it’s better not to trust or rely on them."

"The important things are three: to command them in a way that prevents wrongdoing, to assume they won’t do any work other than what you command, and to never free them from their slave status."

<b>

I see, management is crucial.

<b>

"Huh? Then if you command the slave from the start not to do anything wrong, wouldn’t that prevent the master from being ruined by being blamed for the slave's wrongdoing?"

"If the slave doesn’t think it’s wrong, they can still do it."

<b>

The slave's perspective, huh. Those who think "stealing is natural" can’t be stopped like this. What a hassle…!

<b>

<b>

"So, while I mentioned that most slaves fell into slavery due to wrongdoing or debt, there are some who didn’t. Those are problematic for different reasons… but if you’re buying, that’s where you should aim."

"Oh? Why is that?"

"If you have more issues than them, you might not care as much, depending on the content."

"Are you a genius, senpai?"

<b>

I’m convinced. Huh, as expected of Blade-senpai.

<b>

"Alright! Then let’s go see that problematic slave right away!!"

"That’s impossible."

"What!? Why not, is a reservation needed?"

"No, there was only one slave trader in this town."

"Oh."

<b>

There was only one. If that’s the case, then now there are none.

Who on earth destroyed the slave trader… It’s my fault, damn it!

<b>

"We were completely on track to buy a slave, weren’t we!!"

"Besides, you don’t have the money to buy one. Slaves basically cost gold coins."

<b>

Slaves don’t just disappear, but at least until a new slave trader is established, purchasing is impossible. Apparently, they can’t make contracts for slave marks.

The merchant guild is probably in chaos right now. It’s quite a lucrative business, after all, being a slave trader.

<b>

"Then let’s go chop wood for some money and take it out on my frustration!"

"They said they’d lower the buying price for that too, due to storage space issues. They’ve definitely cut too much."

<b>

What? I didn’t hear that! This is just a series of misfortunes, ugh!!
