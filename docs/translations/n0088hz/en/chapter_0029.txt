# The Story of Adult Shopping, cont.

I, Karina-chan. I asked one of my seniors, "I want to buy a slave, what's it like?" I was confronted with a terrible reality!

But then, what does it mean to say, "If you're a soloist, having a slave is an option"?

What is he trying to do by shaking my heart?　Oh, Blade-senpai!

<blank>

Well, so much for the jokes.

<blank>

I thought you were against owning slaves, as the story goes."

I'm talking about for the purpose of eroticism or as a lapdog. If you want them to work as slaves, that's different.

Why do you say I'm here for pornography?

<blank>

We are girls!　Neat and clean!

<blank>

You're not going to mend your ways now, Carina. You had the same look in your eyes as Shildon did back then."

I knew at first glance that I had to threaten them hard or they would cheat me. I knew at a glance that I had to threaten him hard or he would cheat me.

'...... I didn't know I had eyes that easy to understand.'

<blank>

I can't even hear a peep out of him!

<blank>

And if you think about it, the only decent men and women who would work in a whorehouse for pornography would be the ones who stay there.　The ones that are left are the ones that look good and are definitely out of line.

I'm sure it was ......!"

<blank>

Slaves have no right of veto.

And as far as I'm concerned, there are no slaves left because the traders in that area are fishing them out.

It would be a miracle if there were. Or maybe illegal slaves who would be caught if they possessed it, or so they say.

<blank>

On the other hand, you can still get a better one if you are a regular slave.

Naturally, the best ones sell first, so if you are late, you will only get losers, but the fact that there are some Ataris in the mix is still good.

<blank>

In. If you're going to treat me as a companion or a servant, I'd rather be a slave. Especially since you seem to have so many secrets."

Oh, I knew you'd notice.

<blank>

I'm not hiding it too aggressively.

<blank>

Well, I'm not going to pry. That's what adventurers do.

Actually, I'm God's messenger.

I told you I ain't gonna pry!　I'd rather you didn't!　Don't drag me into this!

<blank>

Damn. I was hoping you could help me collect sacred artifacts or something.

<blank>

'Let's get back to the story. Slaves are cursed in many ways. One of them is that of strict secrecy. If he or she decides to reveal a secret, his or her body, including his or her voice, will cease to move."

"Oh, so I can just tell them to keep their mouths shut because it's a secret, and they'll be safe?"

"That's what I mean. Merchants and such have lots of secrets, and they're useful workers."

<blank>

Certainly employees who keep secrets would be useful.

<blank>

But remember that most of the slaves who are sold have fallen into slavery because of bad behavior or debt. The slaves are walking wallets.

So ...... useful, but not to be trusted or relied upon."

There are three things that are important. Give orders on the premise that they will do something bad so that they cannot do something bad. To order them to do nothing but what you order them to do. And not to release them from their slavery."

<blank>

I see, management is important, he said.

<blank>

"Hmm?　If that's the case, why don't you just order the slaves not to misbehave from the beginning, so there won't be any masters who will be ruined by having their sins blamed on the slaves?"

If you don't think slavery is bad, don't do it."

<blank>

The subjectivity of slaves, huh? I guess this doesn't stop those who think they 'deserve to steal' as they breathe. It's a pain in the ass. ......

<blank>

<blank>

"So, I told you that most slaves fell into slavery because of bad behavior or debt, but there are some who didn't. Those are the ones that are bad ...... that are wacky in other ways, but if you're buying, this is the place to aim for."

What?　Why why?"

If you're more of a wacko, it wouldn't bother you a bit, would it?　It depends on what it is."

You're a genius, senpai."

<blank>

I'm convinced. Hmph, that's Blade Sensei for you.

<blank>

Good!　Then let's go see that wacky slave right away!"

You can't do that."

What?　Why, do I need an appointment or something?"

No, there was only one slave trade in this town."

Ah."

<blank>

There was only one. If so, now there is none.

Who in the world crushed the slave trade ...... I'm the cause of it, damn it!

<blank>

I was already completely in the process of buying slaves!"

You don't have the money to buy them in the first place. Slaves are basically made out of gold."

<blank>

Slaves don't disappear and disappear, but they can't be purchased, at least not until a new slaver is found. They can't contract for slave crests or anything like that.

He said that the merchants' guild must be having a hard time right now. The slavers' guild must have a lot of interest in the slavers' business.

<blank>

Then I'm going to the lumberjacks to get hungry and make some money, so please help me out!"

They said they're lowering the purchase price there too. "They said they're lowering the purchase price, too, because of storage space. We've cut down too many trees."

<blank>

What's that? I didn't hear that!　You're just stepping on my toes, mooo!
