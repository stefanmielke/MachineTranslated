# That's something I see sometimes.

It is a hell of an erotic dungeon to trigger such a trap as soon as we are the only women in it.

If it's the Lord's work here, we seem to be very much in synch.

It's no wonder there are slimes out there that only dissolve clothes."

Oh, I see that from time to time. Some garbage disposal slimes are trained not to eat living things."

Is that normal?"

<blank>

Anyway, we have no choice but to continue our search. ...... No, wait?

<blank>

Here, what do you think is at the end of this pit?"

What, you mean like the ...... dump?"

"You know, the place where they go to all the trouble of taking apart just the clothes and equipment and then drop the intruder alive?"

Oh. If you put it that way, it might lead to some kind of prison-like place!

<blank>

That means there is some kind of space. It may be a short cut to the back of the building, rather than continuing to search along the path.

The destination would be a prison, but we just need to bring it in without disabling the equipment. Just to be safe, I set up the pointer to transfer back to the original location.

<blank>

I'll just put all my clothes in for a second and shove 'em in." Let's stow all the clothes for a second and shove 'em in."

I'm not sure if it's safe if you're alive or not, but I don't think so. Even if they say that it's OK if you're alive, you can't just rush into the net.

<blank>

...... It's certainly quicker and safer that way.

<blank>

You're not a wise general by any means, Misha.

Kalina is a silly girl, so I don't blame her."

You're forgetting that if I hadn't used spatial magic to keep you in the air right now, you'd be flying headlong."

If you're going to go, you'd better get a move on. We don't have much time, do we?"

<blank>

And I metastasized with Misha to check the end of the pit.

<blank>

The end of the hole was still like a prison cell. Cushions were set up at an angle to safely contain them. The lizardman who had been dropped earlier was lying limp.

<blank>

'On second thought, maybe I should have just shot a pointer at the Lizardman, knocked him down, and then transitioned. It would have saved time and been safer."

"If it's Carina, she'll be back in a second anyway, so it won't matter, will it?"

"That's true, too. So--"

<blank>

I look at the blonde-haired, red-eyed woman in front of the jail.

Hmmm, a beautiful girl. She's a beautiful girl in white with a blonde ponytail. She has quick glasses.

<blank>

......I quite like it, to be honest. I would love to have a taste of it before giving it to the gods as a sacrifice. I'm sure the gods would punish me if I did that.

<blank>

"Am I correct in assuming that you're the guy who calls himself the True God of Chaos or some such tony name?"

Am I right in saying that you are the devil's minion?

Huh?"　Uh, hmm?　How about ......?"

<blank>

When asked the other way around, I was stumped.

In fact, it is nothing but a god of destruction for the alchemical kingdom - the former alchemical kingdom.

I don't feel any different when they call that God the devil. I'm forced to mince words. ......
