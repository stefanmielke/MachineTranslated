# That's something I see occasionally.

The moment we became all women, to activate such a trap is quite the erotic dungeon.

If this is the work of the master here, we might get along very well.

<b>

"Well, it wouldn't be surprising if a slime that only melts clothes shows up."

"Oh, that's something I see occasionally. There are also garbage disposal slimes trained not to eat living beings."

"Are they normally around?"

<b>

Anyway, we have no choice but to continue the exploration. ...Wait a minute?

<b>

"What do you think is beyond this pitfall?"

"Uh, well... a garbage dump or something?"

"It's a place specifically designed to strip intruders of their clothes and equipment and let them fall, you know?"

"Oh. If you put it that way, it might lead to something like a prison!"

<b>

Exactly. In other words, it means there is some kind of space. Instead of exploring along the path, we might be able to shortcut deeper inside.

It might lead to a prison, but we can just bring our equipment without nullifying it. Just to be safe, I'll set a pointer so we can teleport back to the original location.

<b>

"Alright. I'll store all my clothes for a moment and dive in."

"Eh, no, just teleport to the end of the net. Even if you say being in your natural form is fine, diving in is scary."

<b>

...Indeed, that would be quicker and safer.

<b>

"The name of a wise strategist isn't just for show, Misha."

"Karina is a bit of a fool, so it can't be helped."

"Don't forget that if I hadn't been holding you in the air with spatial magic, you'd be falling straight down!"

"Shut up and if we're going, let's move quickly. We don't have much time, right?"

<b>

With that, I teleported with Misha to check what was beyond the pitfall.

<b>

Beyond the hole was indeed like a prison. A diagonal cushion was set up to safely store whoever fell. The lizardman we dropped earlier was lying there, exhausted.

<b>

"Thinking about it, I could have just shot the pointer into the lizardman and teleported after knocking him down. It would save time and be safer."

"Well, for Karina, it wouldn't take long to return anyway, right?"

"That's true. So—"

<b>

I looked at the blonde-haired, red-eyed girl in front of the prison.

Hmm, a beautiful girl. A white coat-wearing beauty with a blonde ponytail. She adjusts her glasses.

<b>

...To be honest, she's quite my type. I really want to taste her before handing her over to the god as a sacrifice. Well, if I did that, I’d probably get punished by the god for acting on my own.

<b>

"Are you the one who calls herself the true god of chaos or whatever ridiculous name that is?"

"Are you the devil's minion then?"

"Eh? Ah, um? I wonder...?"

<b>

Being asked in reverse left me at a loss.

In reality, for the Alchemy Kingdom—formerly the Alchemy Kingdom—it is nothing but a destruction god.

I wouldn't feel any discomfort calling that god a devil. I have no choice but to be vague with my words...!
