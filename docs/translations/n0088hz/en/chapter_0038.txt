# Fateful Encounter () ●Illustrations

Anyway, I don't have any plans to cut parchment at the moment, so I'm looking for other magical tools.

<blank>

I also have a golem, which we don't have here. How about it?

"Golem?　There is such a thing?"

"Yes, well, it costs more than a carriage and a set of horses.

<blank>

Don't try to sell that kind of thing to peddlers.

<blank>

"Is there some kind of magic tool that would be easier to use?"

'Oh, just in case you're interested, there's one that's a hot seller, the one that sets you on fire. Three silver coins."

May I take a look?"

<blank>

The owner pulled out a round ball about the size of a tangerine. He said it could be used about 10 times.

<blank>

...... seems subtle, expensive, and useless."

They are often used in the fireplaces of noble families. It's a good source of money, including the fact that it breaks down in moderation.

I see. Is there anything more for adventurers and peddlers?"

I don't think we carry that kind of thing. How about the one on the shelf over there?　I think they're reasonable, five large copper coins."

<blank>

When I look, there is still a tangerine-sized ball on the shelf. What is this?

<blank>

It's just a ball that makes noise and shakes when you press the button. It's a toy that I used to make for practice, to soothe children.

Hoh." ...... hmm?"

<blank>

I'm shaking balls ......!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Can I try a few things?"

Go ahead."

<blank>

When I asked permission and pressed the switch, a whooping sound like the blowing of a toy trumpet came out, and it began to shake and tremble.

<blank>

"...... hmm."

<blank>

It is trembling and shaking. When I grasped it, its vibration did not diminish, it was quite strong.

<blank>

'Sound is disturbing. Do you have this one with the sound feature removed?"

What?　The sound would make the kids happier, right?　In fact, when my daughter was a baby--"

I don't need it. I'll buy one without sound."

"......, I'm going to remove the sound feature, just give me a minute."

<blank>

Saying that, the owner took out what looked like a flat-blade screwdriver, snapped open the ball, and removed the part inside. Hmmm, that's the sound function.

<blank>

I've removed the sound parts.　I've removed the sound parts and the price is three large copper coins."

Are you serious?　Then I want to buy two more for now. I'll give you a silver coin for the cost of one large copper coin.

I don't mind. I'll give you 10 bags of lotion at a 10% discount, so that's 11 bags for 10 silver coins. 33 bags, okay?"

<blank>

Hmm?　That's not a subtle 10% discount. ...... Well, okay.

Considering the original cost of the trip and other expenses, I would not have made much money by buying enough to fill my backpack, but that's not the point, now it's about the balls.

<blank>

Hmph, this will sell. It will sell. ......!"

I removed the sound feature.　I removed the function to make sound. Even a beginner in alchemy can make it easily.

<blank>

Oops, I must have been talking to myself. Oh well. Product development is another important point for merchants.

<blank>

How do you like that? Would you like to sign a contract with me or something?"

"Contract?　I'm sorry, but this just got a whole lot bigger all of a sudden."

I have an idea to sell this guy even more. Nah, I don't think it's a loss ....... Maybe."

I don't want to sell you lotion. I'll sell you the lotion, so get the hell out of here."

<blank>

Hmmm, not enough credit.

...... Well, that's okay. If it's just vibrations, then even a beginner in alchemy can make it easily. ......

<blank>

That means you can make it yourself!

I should rather be able to make it myself, considering all the fine-tuning I have to do!

<blank>

If so, I want to make it myself. Or tell me where I can learn how to make it."

I have my old alchemy book, I'll sell it to you for ten silver coins.

I bought it!　That's 41 silver coins!"

Can you pay me properly?" ......Yeah, that was no problem. You can come back and buy more."

<blank>

We did it!　I got the info on alchemy!

If you learn alchemy skills with this, you should be able to make a lot of things with your woodworking skills: ...... Yes, like a 'massager'!
