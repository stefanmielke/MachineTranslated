Anyway, since I don't plan to cut the parchment at the moment, I'll look for other magical tools.

<b>

"There's a golem, but it's not here. How about that?"

"A golem? Really, there are such things?"

"Yeah, well, it's more expensive than a set of a carriage and horses."

<b>

Don't try to sell that to the traveling merchant.

<b>

"Isn't there something more user-friendly?"

"Ah, we do have a popular item that lights a fire. It's three silver coins."

"Can I take a look at it?"

<b>

What the shopkeeper pulled out was a round ball about the size of a tangerine. It seems you put it in the firewood and press a switch to ignite it. It can be reused about ten times.

<b>

"…It's a bit expensive and seems inconvenient to use."

"It's often used in noble households' fireplaces. Well, it's a good source of income, including the fact that it breaks down occasionally."

"I see. Don't you have something more suited for adventurers or traveling merchants?"

"Hmm, we might not carry that kind of thing. Oh, how about that one on the shelf over there? I think it's reasonably priced at five copper coins."

<b>

Looking over, there was indeed a tangerine-sized ball on the shelf. What is this?

<b>

"It's a ball that just makes noise or vibrates when you press a button. I made it as a practice item long ago; it's a toy to entertain children."

"Oh. …Huh?"

<b>

A vibrating ball… you say!?

<b>

"Can I try it out?"

"Go ahead."

<b>

With permission, I pressed the switch, and it emitted a sound like a toy trumpet, making a honking noise and starting to vibrate.

<b>

"…Hmm."

<b>

It's vibrating quite a bit. Even when I hold it, the vibration doesn't weaken; it's quite strong.

<b>

"The noise is annoying. Do you have one without the sound function?"

"Huh? The sound makes it more enjoyable for kids, you know? When my daughter was a baby—"

"I don't need it. I'll buy one without sound."

"…Then I'll remove the sound function, so lend it to me for a bit."

<b>

Saying that, the shopkeeper took out what looked like a flathead screwdriver and opened the ball, removing the parts inside. Oh, so that's the sound function.

<b>

"Is this good? I removed the sound parts, and the price is three copper coins."

"Seriously? Then I want to buy two more for now. I'll give you one silver coin for the labor cost."

"That's fine. …Well, I'll also give you ten bags of lotion at a 10% discount, so it'll be ten silver coins for eleven bags. Is thirty-three bags okay?"

<b>

Huh? That doesn’t seem like a proper 10% discount… but whatever.

Considering the original travel expenses, even buying enough to fill my backpack wouldn't yield much profit, but right now, it's all about the balls.

<b>

"Hehehe, this will sell. It will sell…!"

"Eh, will it really sell? You removed the sound function. Even a beginner in alchemy could easily make this."

<b>

Oops, I seem to have let my thoughts slip. Well, that's fine. Product development is an important point for merchants.

<b>

"What do you think, shopkeeper? Want to make a contract with me?"

"A contract? The conversation suddenly got serious."

"I have an idea to make this sellable. Don't worry, I won't let you lose… I think. Probably."

"Sounds suspicious; I'll pass. I'll sell you the lotion, so just hurry up and leave."

<b>

Hmm, is my trust insufficient?

…Well, whatever. If even beginners in alchemy can easily make it…

<b>

That means I can make it myself!!

Considering the need for fine-tuning, I should be able to make it myself!!!

<b>

"Then I want to try making it myself, so teach me how to make it. Or tell me where I can learn how to make it."

"If that's the case, I have an alchemy textbook I used to use, so I'll sell it to you for ten silver coins."

"I'll buy it!! That's forty-one silver coins!"

"Can you pay properly? …Yeah, that’s not a problem. Come back again to buy more."

<b>

I did it! I got the information on alchemy!

If I acquire the alchemy skill, I should be able to create various things combined with woodworking skills… like a "massager," for instance!!
