# Really, really. God doesn't lie.

<b>

Now then. Since I can receive compensation for the dividends from God, I no longer need to hold back on humiliating Misha.

However, if I engage in a ridiculous fight, I could get penalized by the referee and lose right then and there.

<b>

While fighting seriously enough not to be stopped by the referee, I must humiliate her... Hmm, this is difficult!

<b>

"Hey, Misha. How about we make a bet?"

"A bet? I'm completely broke! I'm looking forward to my fight money!"

"Then, if you win against me, I'll give you one gold coin. If I win against you—I'll get to strip you of the clothes you're wearing. How about that?"

"Meow!?"

<b>

Misha steps back, her face turning red.

<b>

"This is a tournament where kids are watching! What are you saying, you pervert! Human! Forever in heat!!"

"…Karina…?"

"That's not it, referee! Look, since my opponent is a woman, it's unavoidable for me to go all out! I mean, I'm invincible against guys, but there are various conditions when it comes to girls!"

"Is that so?"

<b>

The referee seems to understand something with my desperate excuse, saying, "So that's the restriction... Hmm."

<b>

"Given those circumstances, I would like to overlook this, but... this tournament is also a divine match. I cannot show God an unserious fight—"

"!"

<b>

I see, a divine match. No wonder God's voice was so clear earlier.

Hearing that, I raise my hand and declare like a contestant's oath.

<b>

"My fight has nothing to be ashamed of before God!! I swear to God!!"

"…Is that true?"

"I'm actually doing my best to please God!!"

<b>

My fighting style is a request from God, so it's true that I have nothing to be ashamed of before God!

<b>

'Ah, then I'll have God shine to show support! I can't let a mere referee stop me!'

<b>

A well-endowed female statue, decorated to overlook the stage of the venue, began to shine. It's strong to have such connections up there at times like this.

No, to begin with, I would have just fought normally if it weren't for God's interference.

<b>

"！The, the statue is shining! Could it really be...!?"

'Really, really. God doesn't lie. Well, only Karina-chan can hear this voice though.'

<b>

Wait a minute, God? That female statue looks quite different from the God I know?? Isn't it a lie to call that a divine statue??

<b>

'The artisan here just made it and said it was a statue of God on their own, I never said I looked like that, so it's safe!'

<b>

Ah, I see. …Now then, Misha. Let's renegotiate.

<b>

"…Ah, well. I won't completely strip you, so I'll just take your socks, okay?"

"O, okay... Well, if I win, I get one gold coin, so there's no problem!"

<b>

Agreement reached. …Hehehe, just as planned!

By initially saying I would strip her completely and then downgrading to just the socks, it becomes easier to accept...!

<b>

<b>

Now, the stage is set once again. Misha, please dance nicely for me, okay?
