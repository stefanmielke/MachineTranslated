# Really, really. God is a liar and a liar is a liar.

Well. We no longer have to take it easy on Misha's player's humiliation because he will be compensated by God for his dividend.

However, if you fight a silly fight, you will be fouled by the referee and lose at that point.

<blank>

Fighting seriously enough to not be stopped by the judges, but humiliating ...... hmmm, difficult!

<blank>

Hey Misha, how about a bet with me? Wanna make one bet with me?"

"Betting?　If it's money, I'm broke!　I can't wait to get my fight money!"

If Misha wins, I will give you a gold coin. If I beat Misha - I'll strip you of the clothes you're wearing. How about that?"

Nyaa!"

<blank>

Misha blushes and takes a step back.

<blank>

The kids are watching the competition, too!　What are you talking about, you pervert?　Ningen!　You're in heat!

"...... Carina player ......?"

'No, Mr. Referee!　You see, my opponent is a woman, so I had no choice but to be serious!　I mean, I'm invincible against guys, but against girls, I have a lot of conditions!"

Mm, is that right?"

<blank>

And the referee was somehow convinced by my bitter excuse, "That's the kind of restriction? ...... hmmm.

<blank>

"Under those circumstances, I'd like to miss this place, but ...... this tournament is also a match before God. We can't show God an unserious fight..."

!"

<blank>

I see, a game before God. No wonder God's voice was clear earlier.

Hearing this, I raise my hand and proclaim it as if it were the athlete's oath.

<blank>

'My fight is nothing to be ashamed of to God!　I swear to God!"

...... Really?"

I'd rather do everything in my power to please God!"

<blank>

The truth is that I have nothing to be ashamed of against God because my way of fighting is requested by God!

<blank>

I'm going to show my support for God by shining a light on him!　I can't be stopped by the judges!

<blank>

And a statue of a nice-buddy woman, which was displayed overlooking the stage at the venue, lit up. It is strong to be in close contact with the top at a time like this.

No, we would have just fought like normal without God's spear in the first place.

<blank>

"!　Then, the god statue glowed!　Don't tell me it's really ......!

God is really true. God, I can't lie. Well, only Karina can hear me.

<blank>

Wait, God?　That statue of a woman is very different from the image of God I know, isn't it?　Isn't it a lie to call it a statue of God?

<blank>

It's safe to say that the craftsman here just said it was a statue of God and made it, not that I said it looked like this!"

<blank>

Ahai. ...... Well, then, Misha. Let's renegotiate.

<blank>

I'm not sure if I'll be able to do that, but I'd like to. I don't want to pull them all off, so I'll just leave the socks, okay?"

I'll get a gold coin if I win, no problem!"

<blank>

Consent was obtained. ...... Kukku, just as planned!

It's that thing that makes it easier to accept by first saying you're going to pull the whole body down and then revising downward. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Now, once again, the stage is set. Misha, you dance well, don't you?

<blank>

(The book adaptation process for the two volumes of "Ato Goji" that will be published by Dia-kun is not finished at ......!

I have a feeling that the percentage of additions and revisions plus new writing will be almost 100%!　(Oh, man, Gomez!)
