# And the security seems to be very good.

The village is shown in the image from the sky above.

It was not a village, but rather a rather splendid town. The outer wall, which had been cut in half, was painful.

<blank>

Exterior walls and buildings that would have been there originally were torn in half, overturned and collapsed, and debris littered the streets. The grass and trees are charred and blackened in places, indicating that there must have been a fire as a secondary disaster. However, people with shovels and saws in their hands were working to clear away the debris.

A few of them were also golems carrying wood and stone. Originally, golems were a specialty of the Alchemy Kingdom. There must have been golems that escaped destruction or were repairable enough. They appear to be in use as heavy machinery.

<blank>

It's like we're in the middle of a normal, smooth recovery.

The wall is cut in a straight line. What in the world do you do to break it so cleanly? ......

<blank>

I did it like this, and then it just sputtered. Yes, it's spatial magic.

<blank>

"Hmmm, doesn't look like there are any bandits, huh?"

The expression on people's faces is also bright. It looks like they are well organized. ......"

<blank>

And the security seems to be very good. I wonder if ...... is not too rough. Hmmm.

I thought it was going to be more like this, like the end of the century hype.

<blank>

That's it. This must be led by a strong leader.

If only we had a strong leader, there would be no one to oppose us. As long as there is a strong leader, there will be no one to oppose him, and the bandits will be destroyed instantly!

Hm. Leader, huh?"

<blank>

Well, except for the old man who called himself a chaos god, I didn't kill him explicitly; if there was a second or third person left, it wouldn't be hard to take control and start the recovery process.

<blank>

"What's that, ......?　Braid senior?"

<blank>

Suddenly, I spotted a familiar face among the reconstruction workers.

<blank>

Hmm?　What's up. Do you know Karina?"

Yeah. The guy carrying the rubble over there. He must have been an adventurer from Solacidore, but why is he here?

I mean, where else would an adventurer be?　Maybe he was asked to escort you to a material transport or something."

<blank>

It's possible. And Blade-senpai, he probably received a request to help with reconstruction work at the site. It would not be surprising if he was a regular volunteer.

<blank>

I could see the Pavelkant Kingdom intervening. "I don't know if they're going to lend them money to help with reconstruction or just cut them loose.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not. I think I'll go to ...... and see what's going on."

Hm?　You're going now?"

It's like, "I'm going to go down a little ways away, meet him again by chance, and ask him just the same!"

Oh, then I'll be there too!"

<blank>

You're getting in for nothing, Misha. You don't get a bonus or anything, do you?

<blank>

I'll stay at home. Call me if you think it's going to be a bandit hunt."

I'm going to go now. I'm off then."

I'm going to go!　I'm off!

<blank>

and Misha and I landed in the Alchemy Kingdom.
