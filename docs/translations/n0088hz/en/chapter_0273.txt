# And it seems that the security is very good.

<b>

From the aerial footage, the settlement is visible.

It was more of a splendid town than a village. The split outer wall looked painful.

<b>

The outer walls and buildings that originally existed were slashed in half, overturned, and collapsed, with rubble scattered on the roads. In some places, the grass and trees were scorched and discolored black, likely due to a fire from a secondary disaster. However, people with shovels and saws were working to clean it up.

There were also several golems transporting wood and stone. Originally, golems were a specialty of the Alchemy Kingdom. Some golems must have survived the destruction or been sufficiently repaired. They seemed to be actively functioning as heavy machinery.

<b>

"It feels like a pretty smooth recovery, doesn't it?"

"Or rather, the wall is cut so cleanly in a straight line. What on earth could have done such a neat job of breaking it...?"

<b>

Like this, if you just did it quickly, it would be cut cleanly. Yes, it's spatial magic.

<b>

"Hmm, it doesn't seem like there are any thieves around, does it?"

"The people's expressions are bright. It seems like they are well organized..."

<b>

And it seems that the security is very good. ...It’s not in chaos. Hmm.

I thought it would be more of a post-apocalyptic 'Hya-ha!' kind of feeling.

<b>

"That's it. There must be a strong leader coordinating everything."

"Yeah, if there's a strong leader, there wouldn't be anyone to oppose them, and thieves would be instantly wiped out!"

"Hmm. A leader, huh?"

<b>

Well, aside from the self-proclaimed chaos god old man, they haven't clearly killed anyone. If there were second or third in command left, it wouldn't be difficult to coordinate and start the recovery.

<b>

"...Wait, huh? Blade-senpai?"

<b>

Suddenly, I spotted a familiar face among the people working on the recovery.

<b>

"Hm? What's wrong? A friend of Karina's?"

"Yeah. The person over there carrying rubble. They should have been an adventurer from Solashidore, but I wonder why they are here..."

"If they're an adventurer, they can be anywhere, right? Maybe they took a request for escorting material transport or something."

<b>

That's possible. And knowing Blade-senpai, they probably took a request to help with the recovery work on site as well. It wouldn't be surprising if they were just volunteering.

<b>

"We can also consider the intervention of the Pavalkant Kingdom. I don't know if they're helping with the recovery to lend a hand or if they're just taking over the place."

"Hmm, hmm. ...Since it's a rare opportunity, should I go ask about the situation a bit?"

"Hm? Are you going now?"

"I'm going to land a little further away, pretend to run into them by coincidence, and then ask them about it!"

"Oh, then I'll go too!"

<b>

Misha seems unnecessarily enthusiastic. There won't be any bonuses, you know?

<b>

"I'll stay here. If it looks like it's going to turn into a thief hunt, call me."

"Got it. Well then, I'm off."

"Nyah-ha! I'm going now!"

<b>

So, Misha and I landed in the Alchemy Kingdom.
