# Yes, I will be actively looking for it!

<blank>

So, does anyone here know where the true chaos ...... is?　I'm told it's in the prayer room. ......"

Yeah, I might know. Then I might know."

<blank>

An adventurer raised his hand saying so. Apparently he saw the true god of chaos heading for the prayer room.

<blank>

By the way, what does your target look like?"

She's a young woman in her late teens. She's a young woman, maybe in her late teens. Blonde hair, red eyes."

<blank>

What a surprise!　A young woman?　I wonder if I can taste this before sacrificing her to the gods...that was a very lowly bandit-like thought. Gohon. I'll get back on track: ......

<blank>

How can she be queen at such a young age?"

He's so good at alchemy that he can fix a wrecked golem with a tap.

I think he's better than the last god of chaos. I don't know.

I thought to myself, "I'm not calling myself Date with a name like True."

What about?　Our God of Chaos is definitely better than him.　What is the true God of Chaos? Shall I make that woman marry a pig and rename her the Newlywed Pig God?

Hey you guys. Don't mention the forbidden name, much less praise it. God is angry."

<blank>

What's with the newlywed pig god? Give it to me instead of giving it to a pig.

<blank>

Nyah, then I'm going to go kick some ass in the prayer room right away!"

Who the hell are you? If you look closely, you'll see a face you haven't seen before.

I didn't realize it, but who are you? I didn't realize it, but who are you?"

"Oh, I'm Misha, an A-rank adventurer!　If there are no A-rank or above among you, I'll be in charge!

What are you talking about, it's Blade who's in charge!"

That's right, that's right!　Braid is nice enough to mend my sock hole for me, you can't do that!"

How can you trust someone you've never met before?　Unless he was introduced by Braid!"

<blank>

What's really going on with Blade Senpai?　His credibility is too high.

<blank>

Oh, wait a minute. He's a real A-rank Misha, a "Gekikaze" Misha. Well, I don't know about commanding him, but he's a force to be reckoned with."

What?　Underestimated?"

I'll be the chief of staff. Then Misha will be the general and I'll be the chief of staff.　Leave the troublesome command to me. If there is anything you need me to do, I want you to be the general.

"Mm-hmm!　Leave it to me!"

<blank>

Well, that's my senior. Misha is rolling around in the palm of my hand.

The other adventurers agree, "If Braid says so."

<blank>

Okay, let's follow them to the prayer room!　Then, let's go after the one that went to the prayer room first. But we don't want to go with everyone, so we'll go with a small group. The rest of you gather information. If the king comes back, I want you to stop him, and if he tries to run away, I want you to secure him."

<blank>

Oh, I see. There's a chance they'll come back, right?

...... God - can't we wait for the culprit to come back?

<blank>

You said the deadline was three days.　Are you sure you'll be back by then?"

<blank>

Yes, I will be actively looking for them.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

So we, eight of us, myself, Misha, Braid senior, and five other adventurers including a guide adventurer, head out to explore the prayer room.

The selected adventurers all have excellent search skills. This includes Sekko-senpai. Even so, they are C- or at best B-ranked, so their skills are not very high, but there is no harm in having a few people on hand.

<blank>

I'm right here. I was on this road."

What's the time?"

Yesterday at noon.

<blank>

I heard that he walked around with a crystal ball in his hand, peering into it.

<blank>

Let's just follow the path first."

<blank>

It would be easier if I could reach the prayer room as it is. With this thought in mind, I continued on my way.

As we proceeded inside the walls, which were under reconstruction, we seemed to be heading toward the center of town.

<blank>

'Simple enough, the prayer room is in the center of town, like ......?'

Maybe the town was originally built like that, with an important place in the center, protected by a wall.

<blank>

After walking for a while, a tunnel came into view. It is slightly tilted and continues underground.

<blank>

'In here?　I want about two of you to search this area, just in case. The rest of us will head inside. Sekko, please.

I understand. Okay, Mahato. Follow me."

<blank>

We enter the tunnel, leaving Sekko-senpai and one adventurer behind.

Walking through a tunnel that reminded me of the near future, there was a small room with a lizardman.

He wears a metal machine-like object that covers half of his head.

<blank>

As soon as their eyes met, they suddenly attacked, and Misha grabbed them by the neck and crushed them.

The lizardman was incapacitated in an instant, but he showed no sense of reason as he showed his will to resist by breathing coarsely with his hush, hush, hush.

<blank>

Hey, this is not a lizardman or a subhuman. They are dungeon monsters, lizardmen.

<blank>

Dungeon monsters do not need to reproduce and may not have organs for this purpose.

In some cases, there are, but if there are not, they are definitely dungeon monsters.

<blank>

"...... What?　So maybe this is a dungeon, then?"

But what's this ...... in your head?　This?"

<blank>

What is it? A modified lizardman?

Once again, the walls look mechanical, like those often found in the endgame dungeons of final fantasy games.

...... Well, the God of Chaos was the last boss. I beat him first.
