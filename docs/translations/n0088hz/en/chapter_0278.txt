"By the way, does anyone here know where the true chaos... is? I've heard it's in the Prayer Chamber..."

"Ah. In that case, I might know."

<b>

Said the adventurer who raised his hand. It seems he has seen the true chaos god heading to the Prayer Chamber.

<b>

"By the way, what does the target look like?"

"Ah. She's a young girl in her late teens. She has blonde hair and red eyes."

<b>

What!? A young girl!? W-would it be okay to taste her before offering her as a sacrifice to the god――wait, that was a really thief-like thought. Ahem. Let's get back on track...

<b>

"Can someone so young really serve as a queen?"

"Her alchemy skills are top-notch; she can fix a golem that was shattered with just a few knocks."

"She might be even more amazing than the previous chaos god. I don't know, though."

"She doesn't carry the title of 'true' for nothing, I thought."

'What? Our chaos god is definitely more amazing! What is this true chaos god? Should I marry that girl off to a pig and rename her the newlywed pig god?'

"Hey, you guys. Don't speak the forbidden name, let alone praise it. The god will be angry."

<b>

What’s with this newlywed pig god? If you’re going to give it to a pig, just give it to me.

<b>

"Meow, then let's head straight to the Prayer Chamber!"

"Wait, who are you? Now that I look closely, I don't recognize you."

"That's true. I hadn't noticed, but who are you?"

"Oh, I'm Misha, an A-rank adventurer! If there are no A-rank or higher among you, I'll take charge!"

"What are you saying? The one in charge is Blade!"

"That's right! Blade is such a good guy that he even mends the holes in my socks. Can you do something like that?!"

"Can you trust someone you've just met?! If it were an introduction to Blade, that would be different!"

<b>

What’s up with Blade-senpai? His trust level is way too high.

<b>

"Ah, well, wait. She's technically a real A-rank, Misha of 'Gale.' I think it's questionable to have her in charge, but she will be a valuable asset."

"What? Are you underestimating me?"

"Got it, got it. So, Misha will be the commander, and I'll be the strategist, okay? Leave the troublesome command to me. If there's a need for strength, I want you to exert it as the commander."

"Understood! Leave it to me!"

<b>

Hmm, as expected of a senpai. I'm rolling Misha around in the palm of my hand.

The other adventurers also seem to agree, saying, "If Blade says so."

<b>

"Alright! Then let's first chase after the information that they headed to the Prayer Chamber. However, since it's not good for everyone to go, we'll go in small numbers. The others will gather information. ...If the king returns, I want you to hold him back, and if he tries to escape, I want you to secure him."

<b>

Ah, right. There is a possibility that he might come back.

...God, is it not okay to wait for the culprit to return?

<b>

"I said the deadline is three days, didn't I? Are you sure he will come back by then?"

<b>

Yes, I'll actively search for it.

<b>

So, we, including me, Misha, Blade-senpai, and a guiding adventurer, are a total of eight adventurers heading to explore the Prayer Chamber.

The selected adventurers are all skilled in exploration. Including Sekko-senpai. Still, they are C-rank, at most B-rank, so there are limits, but having more hands is never a loss.

<b>

"This is it. I was walking down this path."

"What time?"

"Yesterday afternoon."

<b>

It seems they were holding a crystal ball and peering into it while walking.

<b>

"First, let's proceed along the path."

<b>

It would be nice if we could reach the Prayer Chamber just like that. Thinking so, we continue along the path.

As we walk inside the castle wall, which is under reconstruction, it seems to be heading towards the center of the town.

<b>

"Simply put, the Prayer Chamber is likely at the center of the town... right?"

"Important places are usually placed at the center and protected by castle walls; perhaps it was originally designed that way."

<b>

After walking for a while, a tunnel comes into view. It is slightly slanted and leads underground.

<b>

"Is it inside here? Let's have about two people explore this area. The rest will head inside. Sekko, I'm counting on you."

"Got it. Then Mahato, follow me."

<b>

Leaving Sekko-senpai and one adventurer behind, we enter the tunnel.

As we walk through the futuristic-looking tunnel, we find a small room with a lizardman inside.

He is wearing a metallic device that covers half of his head.

<b>

As soon as our eyes meet, he suddenly lunges at us, so Misha grabs him by the neck and crushes him.

The lizardman is instantly incapacitated, but he hisses and breathes heavily, showing signs of resistance, devoid of reason.

<b>

"Hey, this isn't a lizard beastman or demi-human. This is a dungeon monster, a lizardman."

<b>

Dungeon monsters may lack reproductive organs since they don't need to reproduce.

Sometimes they do have them, but if they don't, they are undoubtedly dungeon monsters.

<b>

"...Huh? So, could it be that this is a dungeon?"

"Still, what about this... head thing? What is this?"

<b>

What could it be? A modified lizardman?

Upon closer inspection, the walls have a mechanical look, reminiscent of the atmosphere found in the final dungeons of a Final Fantasy game.

...Come to think of it, the chaos god was the final boss. I defeated it first, though.
