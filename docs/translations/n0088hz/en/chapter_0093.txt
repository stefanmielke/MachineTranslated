"Karikari, is that child an acquaintance of the elf?"

"Yeah. His name is Dia. Dia, this is Sati-tan, my friend the liquor merchant."

"Nice to meet you. Please call me Dia. ...Sati-tan?"

"You can just call me Sati, nice to meet you, Dia-san."

<b>

Sati-tan bows politely.

<b>

"What's wrong, Sati-tan!? Did you eat something bad!? You're super normal!"

"I can be proper when I need to, you know. Besides, we're the ones asking for a favor here, so I can't be rude, right?"

"Ah, you can relax. You seem like a friend of my sister."

<b>

Dia-kun says cheerfully. But Sati-tan doesn't immediately drop her serious mode.

This is Sati-tan during a business negotiation... dignified, I like it!

<b>

"Anyway, since it's awkward to stand and talk, shall we go to the room?"

"Ah, then I'll reserve a room here as well—okay, let's go."

"Do you need an escort?"

"I'm fine, thank you for your concern."

<b>

...Dia-kun is also quite serious, huh!? Hey, am I being left out!?

In any case, when we entered our room, it was a small room with only one bed.

<b>

"You said it was awkward to stand and talk, but there's hardly anywhere to sit except the bed."

"…That's true, it would have been nice if there were chairs."

"Ah, um, no need to worry about that?"

<b>

Sati-tan glances at the two pillows prepared on the one bed.

I guess those pillows are for me and Dia-kun.

Huh? Does that mean they think I’ll be sharing a bed with Dia-kun!?

<b>

"That's not it, Sati-tan! Dia-kun is for admiration only! I like girls more, you know!?"

"Eh? Ah, yeah. I know that."

"Wait a moment, I'll go borrow a chair!—Got it!"

"That was quick."

<b>

In fact, I just went out into the hallway and took a chair from the storage space.

<b>

In the small room, we sat down on the chair and started talking again.

<b>

"So, what business do you have in the elf country?"

"Well, actually, I'm looking for my sister."

"Eh, wasn't Sati-tan traveling the world to sell alcohol!?"

"…That's part of it, but actually, I'm looking for my sister who went missing. If you don't believe me, you can ask at the adventurer's guild; I've put out a request for information."

<b>

What!? The silver coins I returned to the receptionist were probably the request fee or something.

<b>

"Come on, why didn't you say anything? If it’s Sati-tan's sister, I’d be eager to help you find her!"

"Thanks, Karikari. Well, she's a half-dwarf, my half-sister."

"Hmm, half-dwarf."

"She was a bard, but she suddenly went missing three years ago."

"Wow, a bard... huh?"

"Her name is Aldisura... she goes by Aishia."

<b>

...What an incredible coincidence! We actually have a former bard who is a half-dwarf and named Aishia among our party.

<b>

"I think she’s probably dead by now. But I can’t give up... maybe my sister is alive in the elf country, and I want to hold onto that slim hope."

"O-oh. I see, Sati-tan's sister..."

"Dia-san. Could you please help me obtain permission to enter the elf country to search for my sister?"

<b>

Sati-tan bows her head with a serious expression.

<b>

"…Um, Karina onee-san."

"Wait a moment. I'll check."

"Ah, yes."

<b>

I left the room.

Most inns have a simple altar or shrine. There it is. Alright, let's pray.

<b>

—Oh, God, God? Is this what you call divine guidance?

<b>

"Chigauyo. Mattakuno, Guuzendayo."

<b>

That's so unbelievable!!!
