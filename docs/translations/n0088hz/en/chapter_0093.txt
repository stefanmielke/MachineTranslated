'Crunchy, is that the elf you know?

Yes, I'm Dia. My name is Dia-kun. Dia-kun, this is Sati-tan. This is Sati, my friend who is a liquor merchant.

Nice to meet you. Please call me Dia. ...... Mr. Satitan?"

Saty's fine, nice to meet you. Mr. Deere."

<blank>

Satitan bowed politely with a bow.

<blank>

What's wrong, Sati?　Did you eat something bad?　It's super normal!"

I do it when I have to. Besides, I'm in the position of asking for help, so I shouldn't be rude, should I?

'Oh, make yourself comfortable. She seems to be a friend of your sister's."

<blank>

Dia says so smilingly. But Sati-tan doesn't immediately release her mode of operation.

This is Sati-tan ...... dignified to have a business meeting, I like it!

<blank>

I don't feel like standing around talking anyway, so shall we go to your room?"

I'll save a room here for you, so--" "Yes, let's go.

Do you need an escort?"

I'm fine, thank you for your concern."

<blank>

...... Dear, you're kind of serious too!　Hey, you're not leaving me out!

Anyway, when we entered our room, it was a small room with only one bed.

<blank>

He said, "I don't know about standing around talking, but the only place I can sit is on the bed."

...... yes, I wish I had a chair to sit in."

Uh, you know, without your concern?"

<blank>

Satitan says, glancing at the two pillows on one bed.

Maybe you mean for me and Dear, that pillow.

Hmm?　That means they think I'm sharing the bed with Mr. Dear!

<blank>

No, Sati!　Dear, you're just for show!　I like girls better!

Huh?"　Uh, yeah. I know that."

I'm going to borrow a chair! --I'm borrowing a chair!

Too soon."

<blank>

In addition, I just went out into the hallway and took out a chair that was in the storage space.

<blank>

We are in a small room, and once again we are sitting in chairs talking.

<blank>

So, what brings you to the land of the elves?"

Yes, actually I'm looking for my sister.

I thought you were peddling around the world in search of alcohol!"

I'm actually looking for my sister who went missing. If you think I'm lying, go ask at the Adventurers' Guild, they're asking for information.

<blank>

Oh my!　I wonder if the silver coins they were returning to the receptionist was a request fee or something.

<blank>

What's the matter with you? If I were Sati's sister, I'd be looking for her, too.

I'm a half-dwarf. Well, my, um, half-sister, half-dwarf."

"Hmmm, half-dwarf."

I used to be a minstrel, but I suddenly lost touch with him three years ago."

Heh, the bard ...... n?"

My name is Aldisler ...... and my name is Isiah.

<blank>

...... Some awesome coincidences, huh?　Just one of our guys is a former bard and half-dwarf slave named Isiah.

<blank>

I think she's probably dead by now. But I can't give up and I want to ...... take a chance that maybe my sister is still alive in the land of the elves."

Oh, oh. I see... Sati-tan's sister ......"

Mr. Dia. Please, can you help me to get permission to enter the land of the elves to look for my sister?"

<blank>

Satitan bows his head with a serious look on his face.

<blank>

"...... that, sister Karina."

I'll go check it out. I'll go check."

Uh, yes.

<blank>

I left the room.

Most innkeepers have a simple altar or altar of worship. There it is. Now let's pray.

<blank>

--God, God, God, God, God?　Is this what you call God's guidance?

<blank>

I'm not going to say, 'I'm not going to do it. Mattakuno, guuzen da yo."

<blank>

Lies!!!!!!!!
