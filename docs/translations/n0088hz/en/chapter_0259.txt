# Foolish question

<b>

<b>

I had Kirigon give the village chief a gentle bite (the first time, Kirigon miscalculated and bit off his arm, so I secretly healed it) and got him to spill various information.

<b>

Deduction? Conspiracy? Who cares! Violence solves everything!!

I think this is the fastest way!!

<b>

“Hey Arthur, isn’t the sister the least dragon-like?”

“That’s a foolish question, Kirigon. Someone who punches dragons in the flesh can’t possibly not be dragon-like.”

“Exactly.”

<b>

The dragons are chatting amicably. I can hear you guys.

But what does it mean to be dragon-like? They’re using their own species name instead of saying something like tyrannical or muscle-headed, so I can’t interject.

And since there’s no one else who understands dragon language besides me, no one can interject.

<b>

Huh!? Could it be that they understand that much!?

You guys aren’t dragon-like! If you have complaints, come at me!!

<b>

<b>

Now then. So, I got some information by nibbling on the village chief.

<b>

It seems that the imperial merchants have discovered the hidden village, and to conceal its existence, they were offering a young woman as a “sacrifice to the dragons” every few years.

<b>

“—This was to protect the village… I’m sorry…”

“I knew it. I suspected something was off with you, brother. That’s why I told you to prepare sacrifices from outside.”

<b>

Tenshiki, or rather, Youki-chan’s uncle, is proudly accusing the village chief as if he had taken the head of a demon. Being a demon tribe, of course.

<b>

“But you still drugged us, Kirigon. Please give this guy a gentle bite too.”

“Got it! Understood, Dear-kun! Ahh.”

“Gyaaaah, help!? I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I thought you were an enemy!!”

<b>

An adult man crying out while being playfully pounced on by a dragon. Hmm, a heartwarming sight?

Well, in short, it was the village chief and the merchant who were pinning the blame on the dragons. Yes, yes.

<b>

“By the way, Kirigon is following Dear-kun’s words pretty well, Arthur.”

“Well, Dear-kun’s words are practically the same as the sister’s orders. Kirigon listens… no, I think he genuinely likes it, right?”

“Seriously, maybe Dear-kun is a priestess. But if he does something bad to Dear-kun, I’ll rip off his tail.”

“That’s the kind of thing, sister. It makes Dear-kun look like an angel in comparison.”

<b>

I see, a contrast with me.

<b>

“Fwaaah… Oh? What’s going on? What are you all doing gathered here?”

“Oh, did Misha wake up?”

“When I opened my eyes, I was alone in a place I didn’t know… I followed the smell.”

<b>

The pink-haired cat beastman, Misha, came scratching her head. Has the medicine worn off and she woke up?

Then she glances at Kirigon, the black dragon. Misha blinks rapidly.

<b>

“Whoa, there really was a dragon!?”

“Yeah, there was. He was over there on the mountain and got close to Dear-kun.”

“Seriously? As expected of our princess!”

<b>

That’s right.

<b>

“By the way, your reaction is pretty light. There was a dragon.”

“...Isn’t it just Karina’s new underling? Hey! Black one! Newbies should respect their seniors!”

“Grrr! What’s with you, cat beastman Misha! I haven’t given you permission to touch me!”

“Peeh… Karina!? This guy is being rebellious! Teach him a lesson!!”

<b>

Misha hides behind me after being barked at. Come on, pets should get along… wait, did I tell Kirigon it was fine to treat Misha casually?

<b>

“Why not show the hierarchy through strength? Go for it, Misha, fight!”

“Are you out of your mind saying that to a dragon? You better protect me! That’s the duty of a pet!! I’ll make you pee yourself, you hear me!!”

<b>

Seems like she has a sense of being a pet, which is good? Right, Misha.
