# I'm just asking a silly question.

I had Kirigon bite Satonaga sweetly (the first time, Kirigon made a mistake and bit off his arm, so I secretly healed it) and made him throw up a lot of things.

<blank>

Deduction?　Conspiracy?　I don't care!　Violence solves everything!

I think this is the fastest way!

<blank>

Hey, Arthur, aren't you the most dragon?"

It's a foolish question, Mr. Kirigon. He who beats a dragon alive, how can he not be a dragon?

That's it.

<blank>

The dragons are chatting amiably with each other. I can hear you, you guys.

But what do you mean by "dragging"? They don't say "arrogant" or "brainy" poorly, they use their own species name, so they can't get a tweak from me.

And since no one but me understands dragon language, no one can pick up on it.

<blank>

Ha!　Don't tell me those guys know that much!

You guys ain't dragons!　If you have a problem with me, come at me!

<blank>

<blank>

Well. So that's how I got the information from the village head.

<blank>

I heard that a hidden village had been discovered by an imperial merchant, who offered a young woman every few years as a "sacrifice to the dragon" in order to have its existence concealed.

<blank>

"I was trying to protect this village. ...... Sorry. ......

I knew it. I was suspicious about my brother. That's why I told him to prepare a sacrifice from the outside.

<blank>

Tenshiki, or Yohki-chan's uncle, is proudly blaming the village head as if he had the head of a demon. Only because he is a demon tribe.

<blank>

But that doesn't change the fact that you drugged us, Mr. Kirigon. Please give him a sweet bite too."

Yes, sir!　I understand, Dia-kun-chan-san!　Ah!

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I thought you were one of the enemy!　I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I thought you were one of the enemy!

<blank>

An adult male crying out after being jostled by a dragon. Hmmm, a funny scene?

Well, in other words, it was the village chief and his merchants who were blaming the dragon. Mm-hmm.

<blank>

I mean, Kirigon, you're listening to Dia, Arthur.

The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're getting into. Kirigon also listens to ...... No, that's just the way I like it, isn't it?"

I think she's really a shrine maiden princess, Dia-kun. Well, if you do anything bad to Dia-kun, I'll tear your tail off.

I think that's the point, Miss. It's the kind of thing that makes Dia-kun look like an angel relatively speaking.

<blank>

I see, contrast with me.

<blank>

'Whaaa ...... oh?　What's going on?　What are you doing here?

Hey, did you wake up, Misha?"

I woke up alone in a strange place and followed the ...... smell."

<blank>

Misha, a pink-haired cat beastie, came over scratching her head. Had she already run out of medicine and woken up?

Then he glances at Kirigon, the black dragon. Misha blinks and blinks.

<blank>

"Whoa, there really was a dragon!"

Yes, I was there. He was over there in the mountains, and he missed you.

Really, that's our princess!"

<blank>

That's right.

<blank>

I mean, your reaction is so light. There was a dragon."

'...... Carina's new prefect anyway?　I'm not sure!　Black!　Newcomers should respect their seniors!"

I'm so happy to see you!　What are you, Misha the Cat-Beastman?　I didn't give you permission to touch me!

"Pheehee ...... Carina!　He's so insubordinate!　Let's give him a good beating!

<blank>

Misha gets barked at and hides behind me. Hey, hey, pets should get along with each other ......, I told Kirigon that he could take care of Misha as he sees fit.

<blank>

'Why don't you show the hierarchy by your ability?　Go Misha, fight!"

You're insane to say such a thing to a dragon!　You have to protect me!　It's your duty as an owner!　I'm going to pee my pants!

<blank>

I'm glad you are aware of your pet?　That's right, Misha.
