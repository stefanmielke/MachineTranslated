# Wasshoi!　Wasshoi! (Beebee viewpoint)

<blank>

How much time has passed?

Has the new moon passed yet? Or has the new moon passed?

<blank>

Since then we have been dressed as babies by that woman.

The magical device in their mouths silenced their words, stripped off their clothes, and forced them to wear "obebes" like a baby wears.

<blank>

I don't know what kind of performance magic tool it has, but not only its mouth, but also its arms, legs, and torso, all of them refuse to move against my will!

The only place they can move is within the fences that they are assigned to crawl. Their elbows and knees are never fully extended, and they find themselves forced into baby-like poses.

<blank>

It is as if they have really been babied - but the sight of themselves lying together reminds them that they are still adults and treated as such.

<blank>

<blank>

They won't let you go to the bathroom, of course. You will pee your pants.

The person in charge of changing ...... diapers was Joe, the oldest of his peers.

Only such a Joe was allowed to use a special "potty" ...... nothing to envy.

What's with that white bird design? I heard that you always have to grip the two sticks that grow out of its head when you use it. ......

<blank>

<blank>

At meals, he would say, "Hi, it's time for dinner," and in baby talk, he would make me drink milk from a bottle. That look of comfort, yet completely condescending and smiling. It's humiliating. ......

<blank>

A man in a robe and a white silver once came to check on us.

<blank>

"What do you think, Mr. Masiello? A grown man of your age, this is a masterpiece, isn't it?"

'Hey, hey, you're treating me like this ...... Hey, do you know the word dignity?'

"You know why I'm doing it?　I shot Lord Masilo, he deserved it, didn't he?"

'Yeah, I'm glad you're one of us. ...... Oh, Beebay yo. What can I say, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss?"

O, ogyaaaah!　Babuuuuuuu!

<blank>

Don't look down on me, you animal-like creature!　And when you express your anger, all you get are the words of a miserable baby. Damn ...... humiliating. ......

<blank>

They seem to like it, they're all babies, aren't they?

I was like, "Really? That's what you guys were into?"

Ba, buh!　Ogya, ogya, ogya!"

<blank>

No, no!　I can't speak because of this magical device in my mouth!　It's not that I won't speak up!

<blank>

"Yeah?　He likes it so much he won't even let go of his pacifier."

I'm just saying, some people are into that kind of stuff, you know? Well, I'll just pretend I didn't see it."

Ha-ha-ha. That's right. Good for you, huh?"

<blank>

He looked down at me with a disappointed look. ......

Oh, my God. It's because of this grimoire. It's because of this grimoire!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Then one day after a few days.

Just as his fellow trainees who had been training to be tortured were completely exhausted, a robed man appeared and happily said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

<blank>

"Rejoice!　The day we turn you over to the Guild?"

Giggle!"

<blank>

Oh, at last we can be free from this hell. ......

<blank>

Now it's time to show off. Let's get dressed up for the last time.

Babu...... o, ogija babu?"

<blank>

Unveiling. What do you mean, unveiling? What do you mean?

The hooded man lowers a wooden sign to our puzzled faces.

<blank>

--There it is, "Mr. Beebey. The cheerful and silly mercenary of the Holy Land!" was written.

<blank>

Each of the friends also introduced themselves on the sign.

<blank>

'Mr. Joe. Oomey, surviving imperial spy!"

'Mr. Cargo. The imperial spy who couldn't bite his tongue!"

'Chino-kun. The Imperial Spy Who Couldn't Take His Bitter Medicine!"

'Migo-kun. The Imperial Spy Who Peeed the Most!"

<blank>

I was told a lot of things.

<blank>

"Oh, ongya!　Oggyah, oggyah!"

Bub bub bub bub!

Ma-ma!　Ma-ma!　Abu-abu-abu!

Daaaaah!　Daaah!　Daaaaah!!!!"

<blank>

The four friends protested this in quicksand.

The words were converted and I don't know what was said, but I'm pretty sure it was an invective against the man in the robe.

<blank>

<blank>

...... hmm?　Wait a minute. This is the unveiling, I mean.

<blank>

Now, we've done the hard work. Sit down without hesitation.

"Oh, geez ......!"

<blank>

There were two golems. And there was a portable shrine carried by a golem.

It politely states, "The 'Shining Sword' party who plotted to destroy the dungeon!

<blank>

The palanquin had five chairs, back to back. We were seated there.

My body took on a pose on its own, like a baby's. In addition, I was made to hold a rattle in my hand. Naturally, I couldn't let go of it.

<blank>

...... Wait. Wait.

<blank>

Baba, Babu!　Bububububu!　Bubububububu! （I'll talk!　I'll tell you anything!　I'll tell you anything!

What?　What?　Come on, let's get going!"

<blank>

Oh, I can't speak the language!

I mean, this guy had no intention of listening to us at all, from the very beginning. ......

<blank>

So-are, wasshoi!　Hooray!"

"Ba-oh-gyaaa!"

<blank>

And so the palanquin departed. For some reason, we came outside the dungeon right after leaving the prison.

<blank>

What is that thing, a golem?　...... eh, 'shining sword'!"

'Wow, what the heck was that? Baby ......?　Gross."



<blank>

Don't look, don't look!　The more I shouted, the more my lines became the cries of a wild baby, attracting the attention of the public.

<blank>

Wahahahaha!　You've got a lot of swagger, Wasshoi!　Wasshoi!"

Ongi-yaaaaah!　Ongyaaaah!!!!"

<blank>

Wait, wait!

I, who will be a hero!　How could this happen to me?

<blank>

The golem is carried by the five of us. The five rattles that the five of us hold make noise, and they still attract attention.

<blank>

Oh, my, they're watching me!　The people of the town!

No, it's not!　We are not dressed like this because we want to!

<blank>

Ah, but if you turn right at the corner there, the Adventurer's Guild, this is the end of this hell--.

<blank>

Oh, geez!"

<blank>

Hey, wait, left!　He turned left!

What are you doing? It's not this way to the Adventurers' Guild!

<blank>

Yeah, I'm gonna have to make sure everyone in this town knows about you guys."

Gee, oh ......!"

"Oh, yes. Why don't we name the party 'Shining Baby Mikoshi' from now on?　That would be perfect!"

<blank>

Devil. Devil.

I couldn't stop the tears that naturally welled up in my eyes.

So are four of my buddies. Oh, Migo is peeing his pants.

<blank>

The palanquin that carried us made a grand parade through the town of Carcassa, and then took a very circuitous route around the main street to the Adventurers' Guild.

<blank>

Thus, we were exposed to the public and our baby form was exposed to the light of day.

Ohhhh ............ how miserable we are.

If only I could be a baby who really can't think ......babu......
