# Wasshoi! Wasshoi! (Bibei's Perspective)

<b>

How much time has passed, I wonder.

Has the new moon not yet passed? Or has it already passed?

<b>

Since then, we have been made to dress like infants by that woman.

Our words are sealed by the magical tool forced into our mouths, our clothes stripped away, and we are dressed in "baby clothes" meant for infants.

<b>

What kind of magical tool is this? Not only my mouth, but my hands, feet, and body all refuse to move against my will!

I can only move within the confines of the designated area by crawling. My elbows and knees never fully extend, and before I know it, I am posed like an infant.

<b>

It’s as if I have truly become an infant—however, seeing our own figures lying together reminds me that we are still adults, being treated in such a way.

<b>

<b>

Of course, we are not allowed to go to the bathroom. We will end up wetting ourselves.

...The one responsible for changing diapers is the oldest among us, Joe.

Only Joe was specially allowed to use the "potty"... I don’t envy him at all.

What is that design of a white bird? When using it, you must always hold the two sticks that sprout from its head...

<b>

<b>

At mealtime, we are fed milk from a bottle while being spoken to in baby talk, "Okay, it’s time for dinner!" That condescending, mocking smile... it’s humiliating...

<b>

There have been times when the robed man and Silver came to check on us.

<b>

"How is it, Lord Mashiro? It’s a masterpiece, isn’t it, seeing grown adults in this state?"

"Hey, hey, are you treating them like this...? Do you know the word dignity?"

"Isn’t that precisely why I’m doing this? You shot Lord Mashiro, so this is the natural consequence, right?"

"Yeah, I’m glad you’re on our side... Ah, Bibei, um, my condolences?"

"O, oooogyaa! Babuuuu!!!"

<b>

Don’t look down on me, you beast! Even as I express my anger, only miserable infantile words come out. Ugh... it’s humiliating...!

<b>

"Hahaha, it seems they’ve taken a liking to it, fully embracing their infant selves."

"Seriously? Is that your kink?"

"Babuu!? Ogyah, ogyaa, ogyaa!!"

<b>

N-no! I can’t make a sound because of this mouth's magical tool! I absolutely do not want to speak like this!!

<b>

"See? They seem to enjoy it; they won’t let go of their pacifiers."

"Well, I guess there are those with such tastes. Yeah, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it."

"Hahaha. So they say. Good for you, huh?"

<b>

I was looked down upon with exasperated eyes...!

W-what a predicament. It’s because of this magical tool! It’s because of this magical tool!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

And then, after a few days.

Our comrades, who had been undergoing torture training, were completely worn out when the robed man appeared, joyfully announcing.

<b>

"Rejoice! The day has come to hand you over to the guild!"

"Ogyah!"

<b>

Oh, will we finally be freed from this hell...!

<b>

"Well then, let’s prepare for the grand reveal. Now, for the final touches."

"Babuu... O-ogyabab?"

<b>

A reveal. What does that mean? What is going on?

As we were confused, the hooded man held up a wooden sign.

<b>

--- There it was, written: "Bibei-kun. The energetic and silly mercenary of the Holy Nation!"

<b>

Each of my comrades also had their introductions written on the sign.

<b>

"Joe-kun. The spy who survived by sheer luck in the Empire!"

"Kargo-kun. The spy who couldn’t bite off his tongue in the Empire!"

"Chino-kun. The spy who couldn’t take his bitter medicine in the Empire!"

"Migo-kun. The spy who wet himself the most in the Empire!"

<b>

It was a terrible display.

<b>

"O, ongyah!? Ogyah ogyah!"

"Babubabubabu!!"

"Mama! Mama! Abubububu!!"

"Daddy! Dada! Daaaaaa!!!"

<b>

This prompted protests from my four comrades.

Though I couldn’t understand what they were saying due to the transformation, it was undoubtedly a stream of insults directed at the robed man.

<b>

<b>

...Huh? W-wait a minute. This reveal means, in other words.

<b>

"Now, I’ve worked hard to create this. Don’t hold back, take a seat, here we go."

"O, gyagya...!?"

<b>

There were two golems. And a palanquin carried by the golems.

It was kindly labeled, "The party of the 'Shining Sword' who plotted to destroy the dungeon!"

<b>

The palanquin had five seats back to back. We were made to sit there.

Our bodies instinctively took on poses like infants. Additionally, we were given rattles in our hands. Naturally, we couldn’t let go.

<b>

...Wait. Hold on.

<b>

"Bab, bab! Babubabu! Babubabuu!! (I-I’ll talk! I’ll tell you anything! Just stop it already!!)"

"Eh? What was that? Now, let’s set off!"

<b>

Ah, I can’t speak!

Or rather, this guy never intended to listen to us from the start...

<b>

"Here we go, wasshoi! Wasshoi!"

"B-b, ogyaa!?"

<b>

And so, the palanquin set off. For some reason, we found ourselves outside the dungeon right after leaving the prison.

<b>

"W-what’s that? A golem? ...Eh, 'Shining Sword'!?"

"Whoa, what’s that? A baby...? Gross."

"O, ogyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?!?!?!"

<b>

Don’t look, don’t look! The more I shout that, the more my words turn into a deep infantile scream, drawing attention.

<b>

"Wahaha! You’re lively, aren’t you? Wasshoi! Wasshoi!"

"Ongyaaaaaaaaa!! Ongyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!"

<b>

Wait, wait!

I, the one who is supposed to become a hero! Why am I in such a situation!?

<b>

The golems carried us while swaying up and down. The five rattles we held made noise, inevitably attracting attention.

<b>

Ah, we’re being watched!? By the townspeople!!

It’s not like we wanted to dress like this! 

<b>

Ah, but if we turn right at that corner, the adventurers' guild is there; this hell will finally end—

<b>

"O, ogyah!?"

<b>

Hey, wait! We turned left! 

What are you doing? This isn’t the way to the adventurers' guild!

<b>

"Ah, we have to make sure everyone in this town knows about you all."

"Gya, oh...!?"

"Oh, right. How about we name the party 'Shining Baby Palanquin'? It fits perfectly!"

<b>

A devil. A devil indeed.

I couldn’t stop the tears that naturally flowed.

The other four comrades felt the same. Ah, Migo is wetting himself.

<b>

The palanquin carrying us paraded grandly through the town of Karkassa, taking a long detour around the main street towards the adventurers' guild.

<b>

Thus, we were exposed in our baby forms to the public eye, under the bright sun.

Ahhh... how miserable we are.

If only I could truly become an infant who can’t think at all... babuu...
