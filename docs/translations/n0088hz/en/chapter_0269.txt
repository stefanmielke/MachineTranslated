# Is there nothing for me to do privately for the time being?

<blank>

A new house was to be built exclusively for us in the village of the demon tribe.

It is not bad because it is more like a normal house than the base so far. ...... It is like having a villa.

I will gratefully accept it as my reward for this time.

<blank>

...... However, it is a shrine entirely on the outside. What?　A princess-miko shrine?　With a sock box instead of a money-offering box to dedicate socks?

Great. I'll buy a large supply of unused socks and put them aside for you to take advantage of.

<blank>

Ah!　All of you who are building houses now, I'll give you socks, so put them on!　And don't wash them!

If you build a shrine, it's all dedicated!

<blank>

'Hello, this is God. Please add some kind of mechanism to make people feel shame. Make it a strip stage where you take off your clothes while everyone watches you!

<blank>

...... God?　Are you trying to turn our villa into a brothel?

<blank>

'Gods of Gods!　You can call yourself Kalina, the sock goddess of the sock cult!　Please make some kind of ritual to offer socks in a dubious manner!　Glory be to the sock shrine!'

<blank>

I don't like it!　I mean, what's a sock god, that's a god!

Please don't appoint some strange god without permission!　Also, it's a princess-miko shrine!　Dia, you're the principal deity!

<blank>

<blank>

In.

Helping to rescue the already sold demon tribe asked by Yohki.

Although we had secured the safety of the village, we decided to consult with Mr. Dia to see if we should do something more.

<blank>

"I don't know if we should do more than this, but ...... I agree. Then let's let that merchant go and swim for a while."

"Ho-ho-ho?"

<blank>

Dear Mr. Deere, what on earth are they up to?

<blank>

Yes. The most effective medicine, right?　If so, I think they will gather the enslaved demons on their own, so you can snatch them when the time is right.

...... is that right?"

Yes."

<blank>

Hmmm. I don't know how you came to that conclusion, Dear, you're too smart for that.

But I don't know, but I guess that's enough to make it okay, as you say, Dear.

I'll do as the princess says.

<blank>

When it comes to ......"

<blank>

I think about my job. There will be some monitoring of the merchants, of course, but it would be good to see how they are doing from time to time.

We also built a gate (a torii gate that unauthorized people cannot see or pass through) at the entrance and exit from the demon tribe's village to the inside of the empire. ......

<blank>

Huh?　For the time being, there is nothing for me to do, right?

I'm also waiting for Yohki to do some of the sock aging and collection.

<blank>

I'm like, "...... Yeah?　What am I going to do now?"

Let's see. ...... for now, back to Terra Real Bee?　Your stay record as a merchant is there now."

"Oh, yes, yes, yes."

<blank>

So we decided to return to Terra Realvy.

Even though it's ......, the return trip is instantaneous, unlike the way there. That's space magic, man.

<blank>

Since I can show up at any time in the village (or rather, the village itself is within my spatial magic), there is no need to greet Yohki and Galdra and the others every once in a while. It's just a walk in the park.

<blank>

<blank>

"Funyah ...... seriously terrier one nyasha. Kalina's magic is crazy."

What?　Misha wanted to walk home alone?"

I never said that!　Ah, I knew it, the air is so different!"

<blank>

Misha takes a deep breath of suh-ha-ha in vain.

<blank>

I'm going to visit my friend for a while," she said. Carina, I'm hoping you'll tell her that I got carried away or something.

He said, "Okay, fine. Let's just say I was playing wall butt with my butt sticking out of the wall, and I was stuck for a few days and had a hard time getting out."

"Oh?　Are you trying to pick a fight, Meow?"

I think it's a good idea to say, "Well, it was a serious, non-life-threatening accident."

...... sure does."

<blank>

So we returned (for a change) to Terraria One.

Well, I think I'll go stock up on socks for the Hime-Miko Shrine, a.k.a. the Sock Shrine ....... I've got a lot of gold coins from the tournament!
