# For the time being, don't I have anything to do?

<b>

A new house just for us is going to be built in the demon tribe's village.

It's not bad since it looks more like a normal house than our previous base... It feels like a vacation home.

I'll gratefully accept it as this time's reward.

<b>

...However, the appearance is completely like a shrine. What? A princess shrine? With a donation box for socks instead of coins?

Sounds good. I'll buy a large number of unused socks and keep them, so please make good use of them.

<b>

Ah! I'll give socks to everyone currently building the house, so wear them! And don't wash them!

Once the shrine is built, all of that will be offered up!!

<b>

"Hello, this is the deity. Regarding the sock donation box, please add some mechanism to provoke a sense of shame. Like turning it into a strip stage where everyone can watch while you take them off!"

<b>

...Deity? Are you planning to turn our vacation home into a brothel?

<b>

"Rituals, rituals! You can call yourself the Sock Goddess Karina! Please create some suspicious rituals for offering socks! Glory to the Sock Shrine!"

<b>

No way!? What even is a sock god, isn't that supposed to be a deity?!

Please don't appoint me to some weird god without my consent!? And it's a princess shrine! Dear-kun is the main deity, okay!?

<b>

<b>

So.

<b>

I was asked by Youki-chan to help rescue the already sold demon tribe members.

Although I secured the safety of the village, I thought it might be good to do a little more, so I decided to consult Dear-kun.

<b>

"I think doing more than this might be questionable... Well then, let's release that merchant and let him swim for a while."

"Oh ho?"

<b>

What on earth is Dear-kun plotting?

<b>

"Yes. It was the most effective medicine, right? If so, I believe it will gather the demon tribe members who have become slaves on their own, and we can snatch them at the right moment."

"...Is that so?"

"Yes."

<b>

Hmm. I don't understand why Dear-kun came to such a conclusion since he's too smart.

But even though I don't quite get it, if Dear-kun is confident, then it should be fine.

I will follow the words of the princess.

<b>

"Then... "

<b>

I think about my own work. Of course, there is surveillance on the merchants, but I can just check on them occasionally.

I also built a gate (which unauthorized people can't see or pass through) at the entrance from the demon tribe's village to the empire...

<b>

Huh? For the time being, don't I have anything to do?

I'm somewhat waiting for Youki-chan to do a certain amount of sock aging and collection.

<b>

"...Hmm? What should I do from now on?"

"Um... For now, shall we return to Terrarial Ruby? The merchant's stay record is there, right?"

"Oh, that's right, that's right."

<b>

So, we decided to return to Terrarial Ruby.

...That said, unlike the trip there, the return was instantaneous. As expected of spatial magic.

<b>

Since I can always show my face at the village (or rather, the village itself is within my spatial magic), there's no need to greet Youki-chan or Galdra every time. It's a return with the mood of a casual stroll.

<b>

<b>

"Funya... Seriously, it's Terrarial One. Karina's magic is insane."

"Huh? Did Misha want to walk back alone?"

"I didn't say anything like that!! Ah, the air really feels different!"

<b>

Misha takes deep breaths unnecessarily.

<b>

"By the way, I left for a few days with 'I'm just going to play a bit' to my dad. Karina, I need you to back me up by saying I got caught up in the excitement."

"Okay, sure. Let's say I was playing wall butt game and couldn't get out for a few days."

"Oh? Are you picking a fight with me?"

"I think saying it was a serious accident that posed no danger to life is a good idea."

"...That does seem to be the case."

<b>

So, we (for now) returned to Terrarial One.

Now then, I think I'll stock up on socks to place at the Sock Shrine... I have plenty of gold coins from the tournament, so that's not a problem!
