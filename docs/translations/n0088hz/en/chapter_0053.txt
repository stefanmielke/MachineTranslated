# On the contrary, you're awesome.

My name is Karina. I collected the pirate ship with all the sacred artifacts after a rampage on Gomez's pirate ship!

And while I'm at it, I found a boat that looks like a good one to use as a bath, so I'm giving it a try.

Why a boat?　It's called a bathtub, so there's no reason why a boat can't be a bath!

<blank>

<blank>

So after teasing Gomez, he lifts the sailor who begged for his life with spatial magic.

<blank>

No one, no one is going to be saved by you!

It's amazing that you can say that after all this time.

<blank>

But Gomez was the only one who didn't beg for his life, so he was proudly asked to continue swimming standing up. Hang in there, hang in there!

Oops, a big sea eel approached me from the sea. A sea serpent, I guess. Ah.

<blank>

Gomez got swallowed whole. Oh, no. I thought ...... might have the key to "Poseidon". I'll have to retrieve it.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Well, can you eat sea serpents?"

<blank>

The Sea Serpent that swallowed Gomez whole is zapped into the air with spatial magic.

With a snap, the sea serpent's brain is severed for the active closing.

<blank>

Of course, I had no intention of eating Gomez in the belly, so I scratched his belly and took him out. Gomes was covered with a slimy liquid and fainted.

The sea serpent's bodily fluids were washed off by dunking it into the sea, and all of its body parts were poached in the storage space. ...... What a creepy naked old man!

<blank>

I can't believe that the sea serpent ate him so cleanly. Maybe Gomez is a good fishing bait. What do you think?"

Well, that's exactly what I think, sister!

I will follow you for the rest of my life, sister!　With you in my life, I'm a hundred strong!"

'Thank you for saving us, sister. Now, let's all go raid that ship!"

Hmm?　Some of you are mistaken. You're all going to turn us in to that ship--silence."

<blank>

I had to keep their mouths shut because they were about to make a scene.

The Sea Serpent and the boat were shoved into storage space for now.

<blank>

<blank>

The Gomez gang is taken to a ship that was the target of Gomez and his crew floating nearby - a rather large merchant ship.

I said I would take them to the ship, but of course I didn't mean I would let them attack me. As we took them all in, hardened and immobile, we found the sailors on the merchant ship in a state of war.

Yes, you could see the pirate ship. And then all of a sudden the pirate ship disappears and a woman with pirates in tow flies in, and it must be incomprehensible. If it weren't for me, I wouldn't know either.

<blank>

Hello, I'm a passing wizard. And these are the pirates who tried to attack this merchant ship with permission. Capture them. Who is in charge?

What about?"　Eh, ah, yes. Uh, I am the captain."

<blank>

When we handed the pirate over to the captain of the merchant ship, he was puzzled but firmly captured him.

<blank>

<blank>

Dear Wizard. Thank you for your help. But, I mean, what is this ...... we're seeing here, where the ship seemed to break in half and then disappear?"

I'd like to say that I was attacked by pirates, but I turned the tables on them. The ship sank as a reaction. That's how it happened. You don't want ...... this ship to disappear either, do you?"

Yes!

<blank>

I threatened the captain of the merchant vessel a bit, but that's okay because I'm going to give him the credit!

I'll take credit for that, right? Shall I put on ...... Sea Serpent too?　Oh, I don't want it. Yes.

<blank>

"Master Wizard, you must be a very famous person if you are as good as you are. If he is as good as you are, he must be a very famous person. May I ask your name?"

Hmm?　Hmm, that's not good."

<blank>

Even though the peddler Carina Shonin had an alibi, her alibi would be shattered if she could use this kind of demo magic. I was just trying to be funny, but I don't want to get into trouble.

<blank>

Don't try to find out anything about me from my appearance. This is the image of the woman who was being harassed by this pirate. Don't pry into my true form, okay?"

What a surprise!　Was the Wizard Master also a user of transformation magic? If you are so determined to conceal your true identity, I understand. Let's give up asking his name.

Thank you. I appreciate it.

<blank>

Mm-hmm. And I'm not lying, because I'm not saying this figure isn't real.

<blank>

You can't hide the fact that there's a wizard involved, so you can tell me that."

'I was relieved. I see that they are the infamous Gomesti family. It is obvious that we cannot compete with them.

"Oh, so it was infamous, was it?　That's good, that's good."

<blank>

For now, let's just get this out of the way about Gomez and his team.

...... What will happen to Gomez and his friends now that they have lost the power of "Poseidon"?

Once there, the connection with the lords could free them.

But then what?

Oh no, I wonder what's going to happen. I can't imagine, Karina, you're just a merchant!

<blank>

If you've been diligent so far, I'm sure people will help you.

What a nonsensical thing to say.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, that's right. I'll also ask you to take care of the three sisters you saved on the boat.

The captain over here seems like a nice guy, and he seems to have the brains to think about what would happen if he were to violate my request.

<blank>

I have three women that I would like you to take care of. They were being held by pirates, and I helped them out, but I was wondering if you could ask them about their backgrounds and if they're in good shape?"

I am at your service. At the request of the Wizard, ......"

<blank>

The captain bows deeply. Mmmmmm, I'm not bitter.

<blank>

This will at least not make it look bad.

I left my sisters on this boat and transferred to Velarde.

<blank>

<blank>

So, the house of Gomez's land base was also burglarized into a storage space. That day, a house in the city suddenly disappeared.

The place where the house used to be has a beautiful square hole in it because there was also a basement.

Unless you are a spatial magician, you would have no idea why and where the house disappeared to.

<blank>

The rest is just wild and mountainous!　Well, now I have to find Dia's sister again!

<blank>

I believe you said it was at the lord's place. Gomez.
