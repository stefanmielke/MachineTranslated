# You're amazing in a different way, aren't you?

<b>

<b>

I'm Karina-chan. After causing a ruckus on Gomez's pirate ship, I confiscated the ship along with its divine artifact!

By the way, I found a boat that seems perfect for a bath, so I'm trying it out.

Why a boat, you ask? Well, since it's called a bathtub, there's no way a boat can't serve as a bath!

<b>

<b>

So, after teasing Gomez, I lifted the crew member who begged for his life with spatial magic.

<b>

"Who the hell would want your help!!!"

"To be able to say that after coming this far is pretty amazing, you know."

<b>

However, only Gomez did not beg for his life, so he had to continue treading water with pride. Good luck, good luck!

Oh, a big conger eel is approaching from the sea. Is that a sea serpent? Oh.

<b>

Gomez just got swallowed whole. Oh dear... Wait, he might have the key to 'Poseidon.' I need to retrieve that.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, I wonder if sea serpents are edible?"

<b>

I use spatial magic to pull the sea serpent that swallowed Gomez up into the air.

With a snap, I sever the sea serpent's brain and finish it off.

<b>

Of course, I have no intention of eating Gomez, so I cut open its belly and take him out. Gomez was unconscious, wrapped in a slimy liquid.

I dunk him into the sea to wash off the sea serpent's bodily fluids and tossed all of its belongings into my storage space. ...What a dirty naked old man.

<b>

"Wow, to be eaten so neatly by a sea serpent. Gomez might be excellent as fishing bait. What do you think?"

"I-I think that's exactly right, Aniki!"

"I'll follow you for life, Aniki! With you around, we have the strength of a hundred men!"

"Thank you for saving us, Aniki. Now, let's all raid that ship!"

"Hm? Someone seems to be misunderstanding something. You all are going to be sent to that ship—now shut up."

<b>

Since they looked like they were about to make a fuss, I kept their mouths shut.

I temporarily stuffed the sea serpent and the boat into my storage space.

<b>

<b>

I took Gomez and his crew to the ship they were targeting nearby—a rather large merchant vessel.

I said I would take them to the ship, but of course, that didn't mean I would let them attack. I restrained them all and took them aboard, where the crew members were on high alert.

Yeah, they could see the pirate ship. Suddenly, a woman appeared, flying in with pirates in tow after the pirate ship vanished; it must be quite confusing for them. If it weren't me, I wouldn't understand either.

<b>

"Hello, I'm a passing magician. And these are the pirates who tried to attack this merchant ship, even though they had permission. Please restrain them. Is there a person in charge?"

"Huh? Uh, yes. I-I am the captain."

<b>

After handing over the pirates to the captain of the merchant ship, he seemed bewildered but properly restrained them.

<b>

<b>

"Thank you, magician. We are grateful for your help. Um, what exactly... it appeared that the ship split in two right before our eyes and then vanished."

"Just say that you were attacked by pirates but managed to fight them off. The ship sank as a result. That's all. ...This ship doesn't want to disappear, right?"

"Y-yes!"

<b>

I might have intimidated the captain of the merchant ship a bit, but since I'm giving him credit, it's fine, right?

It counts as credit, right? ...Should I add the sea serpent to it? Ah, no need. That's fine.

<b>

"Magician, someone of your skill must be quite a renowned individual. May I ask your name?"

"Hm? Well, that's not a good idea."

<b>

Even if the traveling merchant Karina Shonin has an alibi, if it became known that she could use such outrageous magic, that alibi would easily crumble. I just poked my nose in for fun, but I want to avoid trouble.

<b>

"You won't be able to investigate me just by my appearance. This form is that of a woman who was targeted by this pirate. Please don't pry into my true form, okay?"

"What! The magician is also a master of transformation magic? If you're going to such lengths to hide your identity, I understand. I will give up asking for your name."

"Thank you, that helps."

<b>

Yes, yes. Also, I never said this form is my true form, so it's not a lie.

<b>

"I suppose it's impossible to hide that a magician is involved, so I can mention that."

"I'm relieved. It seems they are the infamous Gomez family. It's clear that we cannot compete with them."

"Oh, so they really were infamous? That's good to know."

<b>

For now, this should be fine regarding Gomez and the others.

...What will happen to Gomez and the others now that they've lost the power of 'Poseidon'?

They might be released due to connections with the lord.

But what then?

I wonder what will happen. Karina-chan is just a merchant, so I can't imagine!

<b>

If they had been serious until now, surely everyone would help them.

Maybe I should say something optimistic like that.

<b>

<b>

Oh, right. I should also ask the captain to take care of the three women I rescued from the ship.

This captain seems like a good person, and he probably has the sense to think about what would happen if he went back on my request.

<b>

"Um, there are three women I would like you to take care of. They were captured by pirates, and I rescued them, but could you ask about their background and take care of them properly?"

"Understood. If it's a request from you, magician..."

<b>

The captain bowed deeply. Well, well, that's acceptable.

<b>

With this, at least nothing bad should happen.

I entrusted the sisters to this ship and transferred to Verald.

<b>

<b>

Then, I swiftly raided Gomez's land base and stored his house in my storage space. That day, an incident occurred where a house in the middle of the town suddenly vanished.

The place where the house used to be had a basement, so there was a perfectly square hole left behind.

Unless one is a spatial magician, they would have no idea how or where the house disappeared.

<b>

"Now, let the future take care of itself! Alright, next I need to search for Dear-kun's sister again!"

<b>

I remember him saying she was at the lord's place.
