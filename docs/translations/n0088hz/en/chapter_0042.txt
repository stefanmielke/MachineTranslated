# I knew it.

"So, what does Captain Gome want with me? Are you going to treat me to some drinks again?"

"It's Gomez! This time you went too far!"

<b>

I had just found this incredibly interesting toy called a golem.

...Wait a minute? That golem looks like it's from Gomez's trading company?

<b>

That means...

<b>

"Next, are we betting that golem in a match!? Woo! Let's go, you guys! If it's a drinking contest, I've got this in the bag, and I'll offer my thanks to the gods!"

"Huh? No, well, I don't really know the details..."

"This way. Follow me!"

<b>

The pirates' underlings, though flustered, guided me. It seemed we were headed to a warehouse.

<b>

"Get in."

"Sure thing."

<b>

As I was told to enter, I boldly walked in, only to be suddenly slammed with a piece of wood. Of course, I was in an invincible state thanks to space magic, so the wood shattered instead.

<b>

No way, I'm not stupid enough to fall for such an obvious trap while unguarded, right?

<b>

A man, stunned, held the broken wood. There were also about a dozen others waiting inside the warehouse.

It seemed Captain Gomez wasn't there.

<b>

"Oh? What kind of welcome is this? I don't think the gods would stay silent about this kind of treatment."

"Y-you... get him!"

<b>

God, please bear witness—well, I don't think this will be very entertaining since it's so one-sided. Just saying.

<b>

"Seriously, I told you not to mess with me."

<b>

As I punched and kicked, I sent the underlings flying against the wall, pinning them down. I took away their freedom.

<b>

"W-what are you!?"

"I'm your poor victim! Eek, so scary. What do you plan to do with a fragile maiden like me in a place like this? Naughty, naughty, your groin is half rapier."

<b>

While saying this, I kicked another man away. He hit the ceiling and got stuck. Oh, don't worry, there isn't actually a hole in the ceiling. It's just a little application of space magic.

<b>

"Damn it, this isn't what we agreed on! This guy's a monster!"

"Everyone, attack all at once! We can't back down now!"

"Y-yeah!"

<b>

All of them jumped at me simultaneously. I took a cross guard stance, slightly looking down, and simply absorbed their assault like a rock.

<b>

"Haaahhhhh!!!!"

"「「「Hyaaaahhh!？」」」

<b>

It worked! As I forcefully released my guard, I sent them all flying with a bang!

I wanted to try this! The move where you blow them away with sheer will! Wow, it feels like an action movie! So much fun!

Now, how should I deal with the next enemy—

<b>

<b>

"Wait, did I just take out everyone with that?"

<b>

They did say to attack all at once. I had pinned down everyone I defeated, and even if they were conscious, they couldn't move, so there was no recovery.

<b>

Now, what should I do from here?

For now, it might not be a bad idea to take everything in the warehouse as compensation, especially since I shouldn't even be in this town right now.

<b>

Karina's eyewitness account? Nah, just a case of mistaken identity.

After all, the real Karina Shonin is rushing back to Sorashidore to avoid getting tangled up with pirates! Just a retroactive setting, though.

<b>

However, it's typical for the boss to show up at this point...

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What is the meaning of this! You there, you broke into my warehouse!?"

<b>

Oh? An eyepatch-wearing captain I recognize. Accompanying him is a merchant-looking guy and two pirate underlings.

It seems the boss has finally arrived. Yay, God! This adds more excitement!
