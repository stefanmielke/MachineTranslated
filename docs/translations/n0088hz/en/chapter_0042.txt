"So, what does Captain Gome want from me?　Is he going to buy me another drink?"

It's Gomez!　Now you're cutting too much!"

<blank>

We had just found a very interesting toy, a golem.

...... No, wait?　That golem looks like a golem from that Gomez trading company, doesn't it?

<blank>

That means.

<blank>

Next, we're going to play for that golem!　Hyuuu!　Let's get moving, you guys!　I'm sure we can win the drinking contest, and I'll give thanks to God!"

Yeah?　No, I don't know such ...... details."

"Come on, this way. Follow me!"

<blank>

The pirate's underlings are upset but guide me. The destination seems to be a warehouse.

<blank>

"In."

Oh, yeah."

<blank>

I was told to enter, so I went in with an open mind, and was suddenly hit with a thud from a piece of wood. Of course, I was invincible with spatial magic, so it was the wood that shattered.

<blank>

No, indeed, I'm not so stupid as to seriously take such a blatant invitation in an unprotected state, am I?

<blank>

A man is stunned with a broken piece of wood in his hand. A dozen others were waiting in the warehouse.

There appears to be no Gomez in a captain's cap.

<blank>

"Onya?　What kind of welcome is this?　I don't think God would be happy with me if I did this.

Damn it, ......, get involved!"

<blank>

God, look at it - well, I guess it's too one-sided to be that interesting. Just in case.

<blank>

I told you not to get involved with me.

<blank>

As I punch and kick, I send my men flying and hitting the wall, and then I hold them in place. I take away their freedom.

<blank>

What the hell are you?

You poor victims! Oh, my God, that's so scary. What are you going to do by bringing a weak maiden into a place like this?　Echi-Skeebe, your crotch is half rapier."

<blank>

I kicked another one of the guys in the face as I said it. It hits the ceiling and sticks. Oops, don't worry, there's not actually a hole in the ceiling. Just a little application of spatial magic.

<blank>

Damn, that's not what I'm talking about!　This guy's a monster!"

We're all going at once!　There's no turning back now!"

Oh, oh!"

<blank>

I was slightly slumped in a cross guard position and just took the leap like a rock. I was in a cross guard stance, slightly downcast, and simply took the leap like a rock.

<blank>

Hahhhhhh ！！！！"

""Heeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!""

<blank>

It doesn't work!　And as soon as they forcefully let down their guards, I blew them all up with a whack!

I've always wanted to try this!　The one that blows you away with his spirit!　Damn, it's like an action movie!　It's so much fun!

Now, how will the next enemy--

<blank>

<blank>

I guess we've all been cleaned out now.

<blank>

They told you to jump on them all. All the guys who beat him were hardened and even though they were conscious, they were immobilized and there was no comeback.

<blank>

Now, what do we do from here?

At any rate, it might not be a bad idea to take the contents of the warehouse from one side to the other as a consolation prize, since I am not supposed to be in this town at the moment.

<blank>

Karina's eyewitness testimony?　Oh no, it's just someone else's likeness.

After all, the real Karina Shonin is returning to Solacidore at once because she doesn't want to get tangled up with pirates!　I know this is an afterthought, but...

<blank>

But flow-wise, this is where the boss comes in. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What does this mean?　Hey you, you stole from my warehouse!

<blank>

Oops?　A familiar-looking captain with an eye patch. He is accompanied by a merchant-looking fellow and two pirate-like minions.

Looks like the boss came through properly. Yay God!　There's more to see!
