# No really, my bad.

<blank>

I decided to take it easy and do some shopping with my rags to riches (God's reward) reward from the convention.

<blank>

Arthur also said, "I want gold coins, too!　I don't want to be left out! I gave him one large gold coin. I thought it was a good opportunity to do some shopping.

<blank>

She is accompanied by Dia-kun. The sisters are dressed in a gothic-lolita combination.

Isiah said, "I don't want to intrude on your date!" and she is staying at home.

<blank>

You said you had a date at ....... No, it's not.

<blank>

"Well, Axe, Axe, Axe."

If you want, you can ask the Five Elders to make it for you.　I'm sure they'd be very upset if Karina's sister put on some store-bought equipment."

That's it!　That's it!　I want to put a real chemo-ear catsuit (for travelers) on you, Deere!

<blank>

In Terra Realby, the land of the beastmen, there is even a set of beastmen impersonators for travelers.

It seems to be a tool for rather hard perverted play, 'masquerade play to humiliate the beast' for the beast racists. That is very naughty.

<blank>

Dear, you have no such discriminatory thoughts, so it's simply a cute chemo-ear costume.

<blank>

I wonder where they sell it."

"Um, I feel like I'm getting a lot of stares. ......"

Well, Deere is the winner of the tamer competition, and I've had my fair share of tamers in the past, so..."

<blank>

And in this outfit. It was hard not to stand out.

And what's more, they are beautiful sisters. What?　One of them is an elf, so they are not sisters, right?　Well, yes. And they are so cute that I had to put a lot of energy into standing next to them.

<blank>

Hmmm, I wonder if dog ears or cat ears would look better on Dear-kun."

'You should put one on too, sis? Like ...... dora horns."

<blank>

Dora angle ...... would be ......!　Is there such a thing? Is there a ......!

<blank>

And then, one of the beastmen approached with da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

<blank>

I've found it!　I found it!

"Oh, Misha. You're looking good."

<blank>

Misha. The cat beastie who I spanked and agitated and retrieved my socks at the convention. She is a very cute cat who is worth teasing.

And if you try to attack them, God says you can make them slaves.

<blank>

I'll protect you, sister!"

<blank>

And Mr. Dear stands in front of me and glares at Misha.

Misha stopped just in front of it.

<blank>

What the hell?　What's up with this little guy?　Are you trying to protect him? He's ...... so cute. Super cute ......, you, what's that cute ......, yeah, cute ...... is the only word that comes to my mind...! I can't say anything but "cute...!

Right?　Right?　Cute is justice, right?"

What, uh, you mean, uh, ......?　Uh-huh. Sister?"

<blank>

Dear, you are still cute, aren't you?

Misha!　You and I are going to get along great!

<blank>

I'm not saying that!　Hey, Karina, take this!

Hmm?　What is it?　A love letter?"

<blank>

A letter was thrown at me. When I unfolded it, I found it to be a letter of fulfillment. What a decent letter.

Apparently, they want to fight again in the tournament.

<blank>

Revenge at that tournament!"

What?"　Misha won more than me, but I need revenge?"

You know what I'm talking about, don't you?　You're the reason I'm called 'God-pleasing ass' or something!

"'God-pleasing buttocks'!"

<blank>

Hey, what the heck. God likes socks better. ......!

If they get the wrong idea about that and start offering butt slaps, that's something God might resent you for. ......

<blank>

I'm kind of, you know, sorry ...... no, really, I'm sorry ......."

......If you apologize so honestly, I'm inclined to forgive you. But I can't do that!　I won't forgive you!　So, if you feel bad about it, go to that tournament. I want revenge!

<blank>

Hmm. Well, okay.

<blank>

"And while you're at it, will you be joining us?"

"...... Yes, I will protect your sister!　If I win first, give up!"

"Oh, oh, that's good. I'll give it up then.

Wait a minute, Mr. Dear!

'It's all right. With the equipment of all the Five Great Elders, ...... will be fine, maybe even ......!"

<blank>

So, Mr. Dear and I were going to participate in a tournament designated by Misha.
