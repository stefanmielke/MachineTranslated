# Well, really, I was at fault

<b>

With the huge profits I made from the tournament (a reward from the gods), I decided to relax and go shopping.

<b>

By the way, Arthur-kun also whined, "I want gold coins too! I don't want to be left out!" so I gave him a gold coin. It's just a bit of pocket money, so I thought I might as well go shopping.

<b>

My companion is Dia-kun. We are in a Gothic Lolita sister coordinate.

Aisia is staying behind because she said, "I don't want to interrupt the date!"

<b>

...And a date, huh? That's not it.

<b>

"Well then, let's look at accessories."

"If you want something, you can ask the Five Elders to make it for you, you know? I think Karina-onee-san would sulk if she saw you wearing store-bought gear though?"

"That's that! This is this!! I want to put a genuine beast ear headband (for travelers) on Dia-kun!!"

<b>

In the beastman country of Terarialby, there are also traveler beastman cosplay sets available.

For beastman supremacists, it seems to be a rather hardcore fetish play tool called 'costume play to demean beasts.' That in itself is really erotic.

<b>

Since Dia-kun doesn't have such discriminatory thoughts, it's simply a cute beast ear costume.

<b>

"I wonder where they sell them..."

"Um, I feel like I'm being watched a lot..."

"Well, Dia-kun is the winner of the Tamer Tournament, and I also made a scene at the tournament."

<b>

Moreover, we're dressed like this. We can't help but stand out.

And on top of that, we're beautiful sisters. Huh? You say one of us isn't a sister because she's an elf? Well, that's true. Plus, she's so cute that I have to muster up my energy just to stand next to her.

<b>

"Hmm, I wonder which suits Dia-kun better, dog ears or cat ears?"

"Please wear one too, onee-san? ...Like dragon horns or something."

<b>

Dragon horns... really...? Is that a thing? ...It is!?

<b>

As Dia-kun and I walk around looking for a souvenir shop, a beastman approaches us, kicking up dust.

<b>

"Hey you!! I found youuuuu!!"

"Oh, Misha. It's good to see you're doing well."

<b>

Misha. The cat beastman I spanked and teased at the tournament to retrieve my socks. She's a very cute little cat who's fun to tease.

And I've been told by the gods that I can make her my slave if I manage to ambush her.

<b>

"Wait! I'll protect onee-san!"

<b>

Dia-kun stands in front of me and glares at Misha.

Misha stops abruptly in front of him.

<b>

"Oh!? Who's this little brat? You want to protect her? ...How cute. Super cute... W-What are you, with that cuteness... Huh, cute... I can't think of anything but 'cute'...!"

"Right!? Right!? Cute is justice, isn't it?"

"Uh, um...? Uh, onee-san?"

<b>

Dia-kun is really cute!

Misha! I think we can get along!!

<b>

"That's not the point! Here, Karina, take this!!!"

"Huh? What is it? A love letter?"

<b>

A letter is thrown at me sharply. When I unfold it, it's a challenge. Oh, it's nothing serious.

It seems she wants a rematch from the tournament.

<b>

"I want a rematch from that tournament!!"

"Huh? Misha won, so why do you need a rematch?"

"You know I'm saying this on purpose, right!? Because of you, I'm being called 'the butt that pleases the gods'!!"

"'The butt that pleases the gods'!?"

<b>

W-What the heck. The gods prefer socks...!?

If they misunderstand that and start offering butt slaps, I might end up being resented by the gods...

<b>

"Um, I'm really sorry... I truly was at fault..."

"If you apologize so honestly, it makes me want to forgive you. But, I can't! I won't forgive you! So, if you feel bad, you should enter that tournament. A rematch!!"

<b>

Hmm. Well, that's fine.

<b>

"By the way, are you going to enter too?"

"...Yes, I'll protect onee-san! If I win first, you have to give up!"

"Oh, oh, sounds good. In that case, I'll give up."

"Wait, Dia-kun!"

"It's fine. With the equipment from the Five Elders... It should be fine, probably...!"

<b>

So, Dia-kun and I decided to enter the tournament designated by Misha.

(It's been quite a challenge since the New Year, but please be careful of aftershocks and such.)
