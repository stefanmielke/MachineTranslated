# Gyuwa

<b>

I toss the broken fang into the storage space and observe the dragon that fell with a single blow.

...Oh? It's twitching, but it seems to still be alive.

<b>

"As expected of a dragon, it’s still alive after taking my invincible state punch."

<b>

First, its size is a bit larger than my car's magical tool. Its entire body is covered in earthy yellow, yellowish-brown scales. The torso has a slightly plump triangular silhouette. It has a long neck and a dragon head. The two conical horns look cool.

<b>

Its limbs are stout and chunky. It resembles a lizard, no, more like a crocodile. Its limbs look like those of a crocodile. The rough scales from its back to its tail also give off a crocodilian vibe.

The wings on its back are bat-like membranous wings, about the size of its body. Aerodynamically, I can't believe it can fly with these, but it must have been using magic.

<b>

"So this is the dragon of this world. Overall, it looks like a proper dragon. Should I try to make it a taxidermy? I don’t know how to do that, though."

<b>

The size of the scales... when I peeled one off, it was about 8 cm. It’s soft to a certain extent when bent, but it becomes rigid abruptly after a point. It feels suitable for armor? It seems like it could be a good material.

By the way, I punched it, but the scales didn’t crack. The jawbone seems to be broken, though.

<b>

"Gyuwa!"

"Oh, did you wake up?"

<b>

The dragon suddenly sits up and distances itself from me, facing me. ...Now, the second round begins!

<b>

"Gyuugaaa...!"

"Hnnnn...!?"

<b>

In contrast to my enthusiasm, the dragon smoothly raises its head and then falls back on its back with a thud. Well, considering its size is about that of a car, "thud" might be more accurate. Thud.

<b>

"...What the heck is this? Does it have a special move to get out of here?"

"Gyuag..."

"What, huh? You're not going to do anything?"

"Gyuwa."

<b>

The thunder dragon is nodding while lying on its back.

<b>

"Could it be that it's honestly surrendering?"

"Gyuwa."

<b>

It continues to nod.

What is this? Can it understand my words? Huh. So it's a type of dragon that can understand human speech.

<b>

"Very well, then let's have a little chat. Depending on the outcome, I might spare your life."

"Gyuwa!"

"Have you ever killed a person?"

"......Gyuwa."

<b>

Oh, it nodded honestly?

<b>

"Gi, gii gii! Gyagya, gagoo!"

"Huh? It seems like it's making excuses, but I don't understand dragon language at all. Is it saying something like it didn’t attack on its own?"

"Gyuwa!"

<b>

Well, if it was attacked, then it’s understandable to fight back. I can't just let it kill me without a fight.

<b>

"Then why were you chasing that carriage we just passed... it looked more like an iguana than a horse...?"

"Gya, gyau. Gyaooon."

<b>

While crying out, the dragon shyly covers its face with its hands.

<b>

"...Ah, this isn't a question that can be answered with a yes or no, so I won't understand the answer even if I ask... I get that 'Gyuwa' means yes and 'Gii gii' means no, though."

"Gyuwa..."

<b>

If it understands our language, I wonder if it can write or draw... but that might be too much to hope for.

<b>

"Karina-chan... Karina-chan... it's the god."

"Huh!? This voice is... the god!?"

<b>

Suddenly, a divine revelation came down. Right in the middle of the highway! I look around, but there’s no shrine in sight. The voice feels distant, probably because of that.

<b>

"The catalog has dragon language skills listed, so I’m recommending it while I can...!"

"Seriously? Uh, thanks?"

<b>

When I opened the SP catalog, there it was: 'Skill: Dragon Language (50 SP)'. ...Well, I have quite a bit saved up, so I guess I can use 50 SP.

<b>

It feels a bit annoying to go along with the god's intentions, but it's also a hassle to interrogate the dragon by probing its answers with yes and no.

But I don't have enough time to write new works...!)
