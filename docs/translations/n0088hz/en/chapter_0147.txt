# Gure.

Popping the broken fangs into the storage space and observing the dragon that fell with a single blow.

...... Oh?　You're twitching but still breathing normally.

<blank>

I'm still alive after all my invincible punches.

<blank>

First of all, it is a little larger than our car magic tool. Its entire body is covered with ochre or yellowish brown scales. The body is a triangular silhouette with a slightly flabby belly. It has an elongated neck and a dragon head with two triangular horns.

<blank>

The limbs are stocky. It looks like a lizard, or perhaps a crocodile. They look like the limbs of a crocodile. The back and tail also have the rough scales of a crocodile.

The wings on its back are bat-like flying membrane wings as large as its body. Aerodynamically, I don't think it could fly with these, but it must have used magic.

<blank>

This is the dragon of this world. This is a good dragon in general. Maybe I should have it stuffed.　I don't know how to make it.

<blank>

The size of the scales is ...... about 8 cm when you peel off a single piece. When you bend it, it is soft up to a certain extent, but it becomes hard rapidly from the middle. Is it suitable for armor?　It seems to be a good material.

Well, I hit him, but I didn't break his scales. The jawbone seemed to be broken, though.

<blank>

Gyuuah!"

"Whoa, you're awake."

<blank>

The dragon gets up shubba and confronts me at a distance from me. ...... Now, let the second round begin!

<blank>

Gugaaaaa......!"

Nnnn......!"

<blank>

I was so determined, but the dragon suddenly lifted its head and fell flat on its back.  Zushhhh.

<blank>

I'm like, "...... what the hell is this guy? Is there some kind of special move we can pull out of here?"

"Guag ......"

'Oh, what?　You're not going to do anything?"

GUARD.

<blank>

Thunder dragon nodding cockily while lying on its back.

<blank>

Perhaps an honest surrender?"

GUARD.

<blank>

He continues to nod his head cockily.

What is this guy, he understands my language?　Oh...he's the type of dragon that understands human speech. He's the type of dragon that understands human language?

<blank>

Good. Then let's have a little talk. Depending on the outcome, I may spare your life.

Gyuah!"

Have you ever killed a man?"

"...... gure."

<blank>

Oops, I nodded my head honestly, didn't I?

<blank>

Giggle, giggle!　Giggle, giggle, giggle!

I'm sorry.　It seems like he's making some kind of excuse, but I don't understand a word of dragon language. I don't know, maybe he didn't attack me himself or something?

Gyuah!"

<blank>

Well, if you're attacked, you can't help but turn the tables on the attacker. I can't just go in there and get myself killed.

<blank>

"Then why was the carriage I just passed ...... that looked like an iguana, not a horse, but it was chasing ......?"

Gee, gee. Gee-oh."

<blank>

The dragon squeals and covers its face with its hands in embarrassment.

<blank>

"I don't know if I'm the one to answer a question unless it can be answered with ...... uh, high or yea... ...... I know it's like 'guia' is affirmative and 'giiiiiiiii' is negative..."

Gure ......"

<blank>

I mean, if you understand the Koch language, maybe you can draw some letters or something. ...... I don't know if it's a quirk.

<blank>

'Karina-chan ...... Karina-chan ...... is God.'

What?　This voice is ...... God!"

<blank>

Some kind of oracle came down on me out of nowhere. We were in the middle of the street!　I look around, but there is no other altar. Maybe that's why I felt the voice was so distant.

<blank>

I'm going to recommend it here ...... because of the Dragon Language skills in the catalog!"

I'm sorry," he said, "seriously. Let's see, ...... bruises?"

<blank>

When I opened the SP catalog when I was told, I did indeed find "Skill: Dragon Language (50 SP)". ...... Well, I have quite a lot of it accumulated at the moment, and if it's 50 SP, I can use it.

<blank>

It's a little aggravating to feel like I'm playing into God's hands, but it's also tedious to probe and interrogate the dragon's opinions with highs and lows.

(It seems like the book publishing process is about to be completed or not.

(But I'd love to write a new one too, just not enough time...!)
