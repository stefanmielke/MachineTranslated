# We are best friends forever☆

<b>

<b>

<b>

I'm Karina! When I bravely asked Mashiro, "We're friends, right!?" she replied, "That's right!"

Mashiro, my friend! We are best friends forever☆

…How do you pronounce the small "yo" part?

<b>

<b>

Anyway, we are friends (officially recognized). Yay!

I did lure her in with a bit of guilt, but now that it's come to this, I have no choice but to entertain her.

<b>

"Alright, let's make a room for Mashiro too! There's plenty of space!"

"What? A room? …Oh right, you said Dia. You appeared from somewhere too, didn't you?"

"Yes, I do have my own room."

<b>

Saying that, Dia pointed to the door of his room. The doors standing in a row will become a gateway to their own rooms when opened.

<b>

"Oh yeah. That one is the toilet, and that one is the bath. This is our room."

"…Can I take a look? I don't really get it."

"Shall we take a bath first?"

"There's a bath!!"

<b>

Whoa, she's really excited about this. Her tail is wagging too.

<b>

"Also, I'll collect your socks while I'm at it."

"Oh, finally. I was wondering how long I had to wear these. They've been on for so long that they feel stiff and gross."

<b>

On the other hand, she had a nonchalant attitude towards the sock collection.

It's not very tasty in terms of embarrassment. Hmm… Oh, right.

<b>

"The right time to collect them is when they start to smell like an unwashed dog! Wow, I didn't expect them to smell this bad so soon. Mashiro, you're impressive!"

"Huh!? I-I'm not smelly!!"

"Well, you can't really tell your own smell, can you? Right, Dia? You think so too, right?"

<b>

If Mashiro, who is so cleanliness-conscious, is this eager about the bath, then I can definitely work with this!

I winked at Dia and said, "Please say that's true!"

<b>

"…Well, I can't tell if it's a washed dog, but I can tell it's sweaty."

"Seriously…!? I just took a bath three days ago!?"

"Oh. Even so, it was three days ago. Alright then, I'll help you take it off. Please sit there, and don't do any washing or anything."

<b>

Alright, alright. I've managed to stir up her sense of embarrassment nicely.

So, I collected the socks from Mashiro, who was covering her face shyly.

<b>

By the way, after collecting one,

<b>

"Ah, the smell of the paw pads is delightful. I'm starting to crave popcorn."

"What!? Don't smell it! What’s popcorn!?"

<b>

I successfully stirred up more embarrassment. This should increase my rating with the gods.

And if I had some explosive corn, I would like to make popcorn.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I undressed in the changing room before the bath and guided her to my pride, the bath.

Mashiro took off everything, including her underwear, and was all fluffy. I want to hug her.

<b>

"So, this is the bath."

"…In the mountains? Wasn't this the back of a dungeon? …Well, I guess that doesn't matter anymore. This is ridiculous."

"It's like an outdoor hot spring. It has a nice atmosphere, doesn't it?"

<b>

Mashiro poked the water with her toes to check the temperature.

<b>

"I feel more anxious than anything else. We might get attacked while bathing outdoors."

"You can't see from outside, and there's a barrier, so you can relax."

"A barrier… Well, I guess that's fine. I don't sense anything. Oh, the water is quite hot."

"A little pain on the skin feels better."

"I understand that!"

<b>

We cast a cleaning spell on our bodies and slowly stepped into the water from our feet.

Mashiro's fur spread out in the water. This is the kind that flattens after getting out of the bath.

<b>

"Ahhh! This feels so good!"

"I'm glad you like it. I worked hard to make it."

"Ah. I don't really get it, but… yeah, the bath feels good, so I’ll just overlook various things."

<b>

Is everything forgiven in the bath!?

How much does Mashiro love baths?

<b>

"By the way, is it okay for me to be in here? Beastmen have a lot of fur, so they don't usually get good reactions at bathhouses."

"Rather, I want to collect the fur and make a mini Mashiro."

"Don't say creepy things. Sure, a lot comes off during shedding, but that sounds like a cursed doll."

<b>

A cursed doll, is that a thing?

While thinking that, I watched Mashiro, who was submerged in the water with only her face showing.

She looks very comfortable, but she just looks like a dog.

<b>

"Hey, hey, you’ll let me keep my room too, right? I’ll pay rent, so let me enjoy the bath!"

"Sure… How about you pay rent with your body!"

"Huh? Is that really okay? Then I’ll pay you right now."

"Eh?"

<b>

Mashiro splashed through the water and approached me.

Ah, wait… Ahhh!!!??!!
