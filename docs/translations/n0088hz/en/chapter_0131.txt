# We're friends... # We're friends... # We're friends... # We're friends...

I, Karina-chan!　I bravely asked Mr. Masiello, "We're friends, aren't we!" and he replied, "Yes, we are!

Mashiro, my friend!　We're friends!

...... How do you pronounce the little "yo" part?

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, he is a friend (officially approved by him). We did it!

I know I lured him in partly out of guilt, but in this case, I had no choice but to omotenashi him.

<blank>

'Okay, let's make room for Mr. Masilo!　There's plenty of room!"

"What?　Room? ...... Well, you know, Dia. You showed up from somewhere too, didn't you?"

Yes, yes. I have my own room."

<blank>

With these words, Dia-kun pointed to the door of his room. The doors were standing in a row, and when opened, they would become a gate leading to his room.

<blank>

Oh, yeah. That's the bathroom, and that's the bath. This is our room."

"...... can I take a look at it for a second?　I don't know what it is."

In the meantime, do you want to take a bath?"

You have a bath!"

<blank>

Whoa, that's a big bite. Your tail is buzzing, too.

<blank>

And I'll collect your socks while I'm at it."

'Oh, finally. I wondered how long I would have to wear them. I've been wearing them for so long, they're so stiff and uncomfortable.

<blank>

On the other hand, he was assiduous in his response to the sock collection.

Not very tasty from a shameful point of view... Hmmm. ...... Ah, yes.

<blank>

'It's about time to collect, because that's when you start smelling like unwashed dog!　Oh no, I didn't think they could smell that fast, Mr. Masillo is so talented!"

What?　You don't smell that?

I don't know how I smell, you know. You think so too, don't you?

<blank>

If Mr. Masilo is such a clean-living person who loves to eat so much in the bath, he can attack this place and ...... will be good-looking!

I say to Mr. Dear, "Please tell me it is so!" I say, with a wink flying.

<blank>

"...... yes, I know. I don't know if it's a washed dog, but I do know it smells sweaty."

I just took a bath three days ago!　I just took a bath three days ago!

But that was three days ago. But that was three days ago. Okay, I'll undress you then. Sit down there, and don't do anything like washing.

<blank>

All right, all right. You've got a good sense of shame.

And I retrieved the socks from Masilo's feet as he pressed his face in embarrassment.

<blank>

By the way, I just collected one of them,

<blank>

'Ah, the savory smell of pawpaws. Makes me want to eat popcorn."

What?　Don't sniff it!　What the hell is popcorn?"

<blank>

Successfully added to the shame. I'm expecting God's assessment to go up on this one, man.

And I am willing to make popcorn if I can find corn with explosive seeds.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

They undress in the dressing room in front of the bathhouse and are guided to the baths, which are their pride and joy.

Mashiro-san is also all fluffy, even down to his underwear. I want to cuddle him.

<blank>

So this is the bathroom.

"...... deep in the mountains?　I thought this was deep in a dungeon. ...... No, that's not the point anymore. It's absurd."

It's like an open-air bath. It has a certain elegance, doesn't it?"

<blank>

Mashiro taps his toe on the hot water to see how it is.

<blank>

'There's more anxiety than elegance,' he said. To the extent that you might bathe in the open air and be attacked."

You can't see them from the outside, and they're warded, so you can assume they're okay."

I'm not sure if it's a good idea. I certainly don't see any sign of it. The water's pretty hot.

It feels better when it's so hot that it hurts my skin a little."

I can see that!"

<blank>

We slowly get into the hot water from the feet up, after applying the magic wash of life to our bodies.

Masilo's hairs are spreading in the hot water. This is the kind of hair that flops around after a bath.

<blank>

I'm like, "Kkahhhh!　That feels so good!"

I'm glad you liked it. I worked hard on it."

I'm not sure why, but I'm going to try to ignore it. I don't know what's going on, but ...... it feels good to take a bath, so I'm going to turn a blind eye to everything."

<blank>

All kinds of things were allowed in the bath!

How much do you love baths, Mr. Masilo?

<blank>

'Now that you mention it, were you glad to go in?　I mean, the beasties have a lot of hair, so they don't always look too good in the bathhouse, do they?"

I'd rather collect the loose hairs and make a mini Mr. Masillo."

Don't talk nonsense. It's true that a lot of hair falls out during molt season, but that looks like a cursed doll.

<blank>

Cursed dolls, is there such a thing?

I looked at Mr. Masirow with this in mind, and saw that he was fully immersed in the hot water, with only his face showing.

It looks very comfortable, but it looks like a dog.

<blank>

I'll pay the rent and let you take a bath in my room.　I'll pay you rent, and you can take a bath as you like."

'Okay! Let's have ...... rent paid with your body!"

An?"　Is that what you want? Then I'll pay you now."

Eh."

<blank>

Masilo-san was approaching me as he was rushing me through the hot water.

Oh, wait. ...... Ahhhhh!

<blank>
