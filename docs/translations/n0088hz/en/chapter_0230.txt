# VS Misha

<b>

The脱衣叩いてかぶってジャンケンポン大会. Finally, it's the final match.

Both Misha and I have made it to the finals without any particular issues.

<b>

Of course, the dimensions we are fighting in are different.

I'm cheating with magic, and Misha is cleverly using her speed to play after the fact.

<b>

Thus, this became the second VS Misha match since the last tournament.

With dear-kun, wrapped in sheets, seeing us off, Misha and I stepped onto the final stage.

<b>

"Alright! It's finally the final match! The undefeated Janken champion, who is this Karina player!? Opposing her is the butt that pleases the gods! It's Misha player!!!"

"Fuhahahaha! Don't call me by that nickname, nyaaa! I'll blow you away, you hear me!!!"

<b>

I feel like the referee's introduction is biased. I mean, I was the one who faced the butt that pleases the gods, right? Misha is getting all the attention.

And, is it really okay to reveal our real names in a tournament like this? I mean, I’m basically using a pseudonym anyway.

<b>

"Fufufu, you’ve come this far without running away or losing, nyaaa!!"

"Well, there’s no reason to run away."

<b>

Hehe, I chuckle to myself.

In my pocket, I have three pairs of socks from the opponents I've defeated. I can say this is already a good harvest.

<b>

"Here, Misha, I'll bless you with some socks too, you should wear them, okay?"

"Huh? I don’t need your charity, nya!!"

"No, you gave me some secret hair ties, remember? This is a thank you."

"Then I’ll take them without hesitation, nya!!"

<b>

If it’s a thank you, then it’s fine. That’s so like Misha (a compliment).

<b>

"…But, with pantyhose, it only counts as one pair, right? Isn’t that a bit stingy?"

"If you’re going to complain, make sure to wear them properly and return them after the tournament."

"Okay?? I-I got it, nya. After the tournament."

<b>

What a good and honest child. I feel warm watching Misha put on the pantyhose.

<b>

"By the way, Misha. Since it’s the finals, I have a proposal for you."

"What is it, nya?"

"How about the opponent specifies which clothes to take off first?"

"Interesting."

<b>

Misha thinks for a moment.

<b>

"…Sounds good, I’ll accept that challenge! I won’t admit defeat until I’ve stripped you completely, nyaaa!!"

"Wonderful. I believed you would accept, Misha…!! Of course, I won’t admit defeat until the very end either."

<b>

This way, I can collect the socks last. Kukuku... just as planned!!

<b>

"Oh! Here comes an unusual proposal from Karina player!! The opponent specifies which clothes to take off, a modified rule!! And Misha player has accepted it!!!"

<b>

With the referee's words, the venue erupts with excitement.

<b>

"Now, it’s time for the public execution... I won’t hold back, Misha!!"

"That’s my line, nya!! Show your blue butt and turn red, you hear me!!"

<b>

I don’t have a Mongolian spot, though—?

<b>

"Now, let’s go. Are both sides ready? --Set, ready... Fight!!"

"「叩いてかぶってじゃんけんポンッ――！？」"

<b>

We both froze for a moment.

<b>

Misha changes her hand after the fact. I’m using magic to change my hand in response to my opponent's hand.

In other words—both hands are not confirmed, and the hands we showed in Janken became a vague mess...!!

<b>

"…H-Hey, is that... Scissors, nya?!"

"Misha, is that a Paper? Or Rock?"

<b>

Misha’s hand is in a delicate position, as if she’s about to grasp a ball, while I’m trying to pull the trigger with my middle and index fingers.

<b>

—I can’t move. I can’t tell the winner!!

What the heck, I never expected the Janken winning magic would have such a weakness! I look at the referee.

<b>

"…Neither side has confirmed their Janken hands, so it’s a draw!!! Both players, please remove one item of clothing!!!"

"「ッ！？」"

<b>

So that’s how it is!!

<b>

"I-I didn’t lose, nya!? This is a tie, isn’t it?!"

"…Well, if we don’t do it this way, it seems like we won’t reach a conclusion. Both of you are serious, so it can’t be helped."

<b>

Misha protests, but it’s dismissed for the proper reason of tournament progress. If I were an audience member, I would want them to hurry up and strip, so I think it’s a very correct judgment.

<b>

"…Then Misha, take off your pants, pants."

"Huh!? Then you take off your bra, nya!!"

"Both are suddenly specifying underwearーーーーーー!! As expected of the finals, going all out from the startーー!! What will happen nowーーーー!?"

<b>

I take off my bra inside my clothes and smoothly pull it out.

Misha took off her pants along with her pantyhose.

<b>

"Misha, make sure to put the pantyhose back on! I only said to take off your pants!"

"Mm!? What, you’re such a stickler... Wait a moment, nya!!"

<b>

Misha puts the pantyhose back on. One leg at a time, she carefully pulls them up.

She puts them on neatly all the way to her toes, and the somewhat alluring movement captivates the audience.

<b>

"…!! Y-You! Was this your plan!?"

"Eh, no idea. But Misha is cute, so it’s natural for the gaze to be captivated, right?"

"O-Oh... Well, you look cute too, nya?"

"Are you trying to flirt with me? That’s fine, my friend, should I invite you over? I’ll treat you to some dwarf wine."

"Who’s your friend, nya!?"

<b>

Eh, wasn’t that the case? Anyway, Misha and I continued our Janken.
