# VS Misha

<blank>

The undressing slap-and-cover rock-paper-scissors tournament. Finally, the final game.

Both Misha and I reached the final without any problems.

<blank>

Of course, it's a different dimension we're fighting on.

I'm cheating with magic, and Misha is putting it behind me when I look closely with his quickness.

<blank>

This was the second VS Misha match since the previous tournament.

With Mr. Dia wearing a sheet over his head, Misha and I went up to the stage for the final.

<blank>

Come on!　Finally, the final game!　No way, rock-paper-scissors undefeated, what in the world are you, Kalina?　Relative to her is a God-pleasing ass!　It's Misha, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa！！！！"

Hahahahahaaaa!　Don't call me by those two names!　I'll blow you away, omeeeeeee!!!!!!!"

<blank>

I think the referee's introduction is biased. I mean, the butt game that pleased God, I was the opponent?　I guess only Misha is getting attention.

I mean, I wonder if it's okay to expose my real name at a convention like this. It's okay, though, because I'm kind of a pseudonym to begin with.

<blank>

"Hmph, I've come this far without running away and without losing!

Well, there's no reason to run away."

<blank>

Hmmm, I snicker.

I have three socks in my pocket from opponents I have brought down. I would say that this alone is enough to get a good haul.

<blank>

Here, Misha, I'll give you a pair of socks to put on, okay?"

What about you?　I don't want any charity from you!

No, you gave me a few of your secret stash, remember?　I'm thanking you for that."

I'll take that without reservation!

<blank>

If it's a thank you, why not? I knew you were Misha (compliments).

<blank>

I mean, ......, that's only enough for one pair of pantyhose, isn't that a bit stingy?"

If you're going to complain, make sure you wear them properly and return them after the tournament."

Yeah?　I got it. After the tournament, meow.

<blank>

What a good and honest girl. And, I'm so relieved to see Misha wearing pantyhose.

<blank>

I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get the best out of me. So it's finals, and I have a suggestion."

What?"

How about, "The other person specifies which clothes to take off first and which to take off--what do you think?"

"Law."

<blank>

Misha thinks a little.

<blank>

I'll take you to ....... I'll take you to ......!　I won't accept your surrender until you take it all off anyway!

'Wonderful. I believed Misha would accept it. ......!　Of course, I will not accept your surrender until the very end."

<blank>

Now we can collect the socks last. Cookook...... as planned!

<blank>

Oh, wow!　Here is an unusual proposal from Karina!　The opponent specifies the clothes to be taken off, an irregular rule!　And Misha accepted it aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand!

<blank>

The referee said, ooooooooooooooooo ！！！！　and the audience goes wild.

<blank>

Now it's time for a public execution...... I'm not going to take it easy on you, Misha!"

I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what I'll do!　You can go red with your blue ass!"

<blank>

I don't have mongolian spots.

<blank>

Let's go. Are both of you ready? --set, ready ...... fyi!"

"Slap it, cover it, rock-paper-scissors-ponk--?"

<blank>

I was scared, and Misha and I froze.

<blank>

Misha changes hands afterwards. I use magic to change hands in conjunction with the opponent's hand.

In other words - neither of them was sure of their moves, and the moves they made in rock-paper-scissors-scissors became an ambiguous mess. ......!

<blank>

"......Oh, hey you, is that a ......choki!"

Misha, is that a par or a goo?　Is it a goo?"

<blank>

Misha has a subtle opening as if he is about to grip his balls, and I have a hand that looks like I am trying to pull the trigger of a gun with my middle and index fingers.

<blank>

--I can't move. I don't know if I'm going to win or lose!

Oh my god, I never thought that rock-paper-scissors magic had such a weakness!　And look at the referee.

<blank>

"...... both sides are not in a rock-paper-scissors hand, so draw!　Both sides take off one card!!!!"

?"

<blank>

Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

I ain't losing!　This is not an aiko!

Even ...... is not going to be settled otherwise. They're both stubborn, so I don't really have a choice."

<blank>

Misha made an objection, but it was dismissed for the straightforward reason that it was for the sake of the tournament progression. Well, if I were a spectator, I would want to tell them to take off their clothes, and I think it was a very good decision.

<blank>

"...... then Misha, take off your pants, pants."

What?　Then you take off your bra!

The two teams suddenly specify their underwear!　It's a quintessential final match, and they are going all out from the start!　What is going to happen now?

<blank>

I take off my bra in my clothes and slip out my bra.

Misha took off his pants as well as his pantyhose.

<blank>

Misha, put your pantyhose back on properly!　I only told you to take off your pants!"

"Nnnn!　What a law-abiding guy. ...... Wait a minute!

<blank>

Misha put her pantyhose back on. One leg at a time.

She put on her pantyhose tightly and neatly, right down to her toes. The audience was glued to Misha as she moved in that somewhat glamorous manner.

<blank>

"......!　Teh, man!　Is this what you want?

I don't know. But Misha is so cute, it's only natural that your eyes are glued to her, isn't it?"

I'm not sure what to say. ...... Well, you're pretty to look at too, aren't you?"

"Are you hitting on me?　"Oh, yes, my good friend, how about I invite you over to my house?　I'll treat you to a Dwarven brew."

Who's your best friend?

<blank>

Was I wrong?　Anyway, Misha and I continued to play rock-paper-scissors.
