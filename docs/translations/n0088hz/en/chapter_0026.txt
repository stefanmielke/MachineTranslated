# Postmortem report to God Part 1 ●Illustrations

<blank>

My name is Karina!　I came to the church to give a report to God!

I also offered my friend Siesta a large silver coin and she was very happy!　Money is strong!

<blank>

They say feelings are not amounts, but amounts are feelings too!

<blank>

Well, that's beside the point.

<blank>

As soon as you take your seat at the very front, you move into the God space.

It's another starry space type. The first white world may be limited to the first time.

<blank>

God, I've come for delivery. Please give me Koshori!"

We've been waiting for you!　Come on, let's get you out of here!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I take out Satitan's socks that I had put away in the storage space.

Wow, the smell is still very strong. There are also some marks where the heel area and fingers have been mended from wear and tear.

God snatched away such socks that were as good as rags with a shove.

<blank>

I'm so glad you're here!　It's the best, Karina!　Ah, the eye-staining aroma that comes with a gusto!　Take that, drobo!"

I'm not a slob, but thank you."

<blank>

The egg-shaped statue that was tossed to me - Mr. Koshori. With this, I can do coshollies in my alone time without any worries. Mm-hmm.

<blank>

"By the way, God?　Did you possess me or something?"

I didn't. As I said before, Karina, that body of yours is so sock greedy that you keep it perfectly. God, I'm not lying.

<blank>

I wonder if it's true ...... No, I have to believe it, right?

<blank>

But it's really good work. I sent them to a place I didn't know they'd be interested in, and they came back with two pairs of top-class socks in such a short period of time!　That's talent!

"Uh, hmm?　Hello?"

I knew I was right in the form of a pretty girl on a man's soul. If it is a woman inside, she is not aggressive enough. If the body were a man, he would be wary of me. I guess you could say it was my good eye."

Well, that's fine.

<blank>

Well, now we won't have to deliver socks in the future.

<blank>

You thought, "Well, now I won't have to deliver socks in the future, right?"

<blank>

I thought ......?　Did you read my mind?

<blank>

Now, here comes God's service time!　Every time you deliver a sock, we'll give you an SP!"

"SP? You mean skill points?"

No?　Of course it's Sox Point?"

<blank>

I've never heard of such a point, even if you say it like it's obvious.

<blank>

'Raise your SP according to the quality of the socks you delivered, and I'll reward you in exchange for the SP!　Applause!"

Wow, amazing?"

Or perhaps disposable scrolls for acquiring skills.

More details."

<blank>

You're not listening to me, are you?

<blank>

You've bitten the bullet, haven't you?　Now please take a look at the catalog. It's handmade by me, so take good care of it!"

Thank you!"

<blank>

A booklet is handed to me with a plop. It looks like a thin, full-color book.

Opening it up and taking a quick look inside, I found a scroll for learning attack magic skills, a scroll for learning martial arts skills, and various other items, as well as the SP needed to exchange them, and an introduction.

I'll read this carefully later - and as I closed the book, I saw 'Expires in one year' written at the bottom of the back cover.

<blank>

"Oh, my God. What's the expiration date?"

'Yes, I'm giving away this catalog for the first time, but you'll have to buy the next one at SP!'

<blank>

God prompted me to open the last page of the catalog, where I found "Catalog: 200SP" with an illustration of the catalog.

<blank>

200SP...... don't know if it's expensive or cheap. ......

<blank>

How much would you charge for each sock, Sister Harumikazuchi and Sati-tan's socks, in SP?"

I'm taking into account the passage of time and the fact that Karina was holding it in her hand and the smell of it was transferred to her. Without that, I'd say it's about 80 SP. ...... Sati Tan is 100SP without question!　The use, the smell, the preservation, the shame!　Everything is top quality. 

I see.

<blank>

100 SP with the highest score.

This means that if you don't deliver at least two more socks within a year, you lose the right to use the catalog, and if you want more items, you must deliver more socks.

<blank>

I can see through the thoughts of God who wants you to deliver socks no matter what, can't you?

<blank>

Yes, there are slavers in this world, which means there are slaves, right?

Then buy a girl slave and put socks on her. ......

<blank>

By the way, SP's valuation is based on my mood. Please understand in advance that a lot of socks from the same person or a series of socks from the same person will inevitably lower the appraisal value. No matter how great it is, you get bored with steak every day, don't you?　It's like that."

It's ......, isn't it?"

If it's just an occasional thing that I forget about, I'm all for it!"

<blank>

Hmmm...is it possible sometimes?

In that light, buying a slave is not a bad idea. ...... I'll consider it. ...... You're totally ready to deliver socks.

O my God, good business!
