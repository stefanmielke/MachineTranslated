# Report to the God After the Fact Part 1 ●Illustration Included

<b>

I am Karina-chan! I came to the church to report various things to the God!

By the way, I gave my friend Siesta-chan a large silver coin as an offering, and she was very happy! Money is powerful!

<b>

They say feelings aren't about the amount, but the amount is also a feeling!

<b>

Well, putting that aside.

<b>

As soon as I sat in the front row, I moved into the divine space.

It's another type of cosmic space like a starry sky. The initial white world might be a limited-time offer.

<b>

"God, I've come to deliver. Please give me Kossori-kun!"

"I've been waiting! Now, hurry up and bring it out!"

<b>

I took out Sati-tan's socks that were stored in the storage space.

Wow, the smell is indeed strong. There are also patches where the heel and toes have worn out.

The God snatched the rag-like socks away with a swift motion.

<b>

"Here it comes! This is the best, Karina-chan! Ah, the pungent smell that hits you! Take it, thief!"

"I'm not a thief, but thanks!"

<b>

A thrown egg-shaped statue――Kossori-kun. With this, I can relax and Kossori by myself. Yes, yes.

<b>

"By the way, God? I secretly set the time stop setting while storing this when I wasn't in my right mind, did I get possessed or something?"

"No, you didn't. As I said before, Karina-chan's body has a strong desire for socks, so the storage is perfect. The God doesn't lie."

<b>

I wonder if that's true... well, I have no choice but to believe it, right?

<b>

"However, it's truly great work. Even though I sent you randomly, you managed to offer me two top-class socks in a short period! This is talent!"

"Uh, um? Thank you?"

"It was definitely correct to send a cute girl in the form of a male soul. When the inside is female, there's a lack of proactivity. When the body is male, it's met with suspicion, and it wouldn't go this way. This is my keen insight."

"Well, that's fine, yes."

<b>

Well, I probably won't need to deliver socks in the future.

<b>

"You thought that I probably won't need to deliver socks in the future, didn't you?"

<b>

...I did think that? Did you read my mind?

<b>

"Now, here comes the God's service time! For every sock you deliver, I'll give you SP!"

"SP? You mean skill points?"

"No? Of course, I mean sock points!"

<b>

Even if you say that with such a natural face, I've never heard of such points.

<b>

"I'll give you SP based on the quality of the delivered socks. In exchange for SP, I'll give you rewards! Applause!"

"Wow, that's amazing?"

"Not just skill points, but also disposable scrolls for skill acquisition are available."

"Details, please."

<b>

I can't let this slide.

<b>

"Hehehe, you're interested! Here, take the catalog. It's handmade by me, so please take care of it!"

"Thank you!"

<b>

A booklet was handed over with a poof. It looks like a full-color thin book.

When I opened it and quickly glanced inside, it had various items like attack magic skill acquisition scrolls, martial arts skill acquisition scrolls, and the necessary SP for exchanges, along with descriptions.

I'll read this carefully later――Just as I closed the book, I noticed "Valid for 1 year" written at the bottom of the back cover.

<b>

"Um, God. About the expiration date..."

"Yes, this catalog is a limited-time gift, but please purchase the next catalog with SP!"

<b>

Prompted by the God, I opened the last page of the catalog, where it stated "Catalog: 200 SP" along with the illustration.

<b>

200 SP... I don't know if that's expensive or cheap...!

<b>

"What about the socks of Harumikazuchi-onee-san and Sati-tan, how much would they be in SP?"

"First, Harumikazuchi-chan's would be around 60 SP, taking into account the time elapsed and the smell transferred from you holding it. Without that, it would be around 80 SP. ...Sati-tan is undoubtedly 100 SP! The usage, smell, preservation state, and sense of shame! Everything is top quality. Good job, that's the highest score for a single item!"

"I see."

<b>

The highest score is 100 SP.

In other words, if I don't deliver at least two more socks within a year, I'll lose the right to use the catalog, and if I want more items, I need to deliver more socks.

<b>

I can see the God’s thought process clearly wanting me to deliver socks no matter what???

<b>

Right, since there are slave traders in this world, that means there are slaves too, right?

Then, I could buy a girl slave and make her wear socks...!

<b>

"By the way, the SP assessment is based on my mood. If you deliver a lot of socks from the same person in a row, the assessment will inevitably decrease, so please understand in advance. No matter how great it is, eating steak every day gets boring, right? It's that kind of feeling."

"…That's true."

"If it's just occasionally, that's very welcome!"

<b>

Hmm, so occasionally is fine.

Thinking about it, buying a slave might not be a bad idea... I'll consider it... wait, I'm completely in the mood to deliver socks now.

You clever God, you're good at business!
