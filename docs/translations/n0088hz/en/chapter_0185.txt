# It's a miracle from the gods!

<b>

<b>

Mii-chan holds the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" aloft and ascends the altar step by step.

Slowly, as if treading upon the history of Tesshin.

<b>

After taking her time, she finally reaches the ritual space and gently places the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" on the pedestal.

<b>

"O God! God of our world! We truly thank you for granting us strength!"

<b>

Mii-chan shouts with all her might.

<b>

"We, the dwarves of Tesshin, wish to return this power to you, O God! Please, accept it!!"

"「「「「Please, accept it!!」」」」"

<b>

Everyone from the Five Elders shouts towards the heavens.

Now it's my turn――

<b>

――Huh?

<b>

I feel as if I've swung and missed completely.

...Huh? No way, a spatial magic failure at this timing!? Why!

<b>

Just as I think that, I sense a part of the sky being neatly cut out in a circular shape.

At the same time, my body freezes up. I can't move!?

<b>

"O children of the dwarves. Do you say that this power is no longer needed?"

<b>

Then, a sweet voice like the rolling of bells resonates through the air, descending from the sky.

Oh, I recognize this voice!

<b>

"...!? Y-yes! It was necessary for us once, but it is now a power of the past. We return it to you!!"

<b>

Mii-chan adapts to the sudden situation and slightly improvises her lines.

She gives me a look that says, "Don't change it suddenly," but it's not me.

<b>

God? Why are you interrupting? Hey.

<b>

"O children of the dwarves. I feel a bit lonely, yet I am very happy."

<b>

Saying this, a white cloud descends, taking the shape of a girl's hand.

Though it resembles a girl's hand, it is the arm of a gigantic god.

The hand picks up the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" as if it were a small stone and returns to the sky.

<b>

"I have indeed received it back. O children of the dwarves, may you continue to thrive."

<b>

The god's voice is cheerful. Immediately after, there's a loud pop! as something bursts.

Orbs of light rain down upon the dwarven village, and a round rainbow spreads across the sky like a halo of angels.

<b>

If it's a rainbow, it's ignoring the sun too much, so it must be something else...

<b>

And then, I can move again.

<b>

<b>

"Ha! I can move again...!"

"...Master? Is something wrong? Are you okay? You're sweating a lot."

<b>

If I were to say whether I'm okay or not, I feel exhausted, as if I had just used a massive amount of magic for a replication.

<b>

"...That wasn't me just now."

"What, does that mean?"

"It was the god. They probably used my body to do various things..."

<b>

......

Wait a minute, is this god stealing from me?

That's 1000 SP worth!?

<b>

On the platform, Mii-chan and the others raise their voices, shouting "It's a miracle from the gods! Ohhh!!" while the crowd raises their cups in a toast.

<b>

And I ran towards the church, feeling the gazes of Mii-chan and the others, who seemed to want to complain.

If this is a case of stealing, I'll definitely confront the god about it!!
