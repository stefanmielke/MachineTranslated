# It's a miracle of God!

<blank>

<blank>

Mee-chan holds the "Breaking Wall Hammer" as if to hold it up and walks up the altar step by step.

Slowly, as if stepping into Tessin's history.

<blank>

He took his time to reach the ceremonial space and gently lowered the "Breaking Wall Hammer" onto the pedestal.

<blank>

God of the world!　O God of our world!　We truly thank you for giving us strength!"

<blank>

Mee-chan shouts as loudly as she can.

<blank>

We, the dwarves of Tessin, would like to return this power to God!　Please accept it!

「「「「Please take it! 」」」」

<blank>

All the Five Elders shout to the heavens.

Now it's my turn--

<blank>

--And what's that?

<blank>

I feel as if I had struck out on a full swing.

...... Hmmm?　Lie, at this point in time, spatial magic is unexecuted!　Why!

<blank>

The next moment I thought that. I felt a part of the sky was cut off in a roundabout way.

At the same time, my body stiffens. I can't move!

<blank>

"Oh children of the Dwarves, do you no longer need this power? Do you say that you no longer need this power?"

<blank>

Then a lovely voice, like a tumbling bell, shook the atmosphere and echoed down from the sky.

Oh my, I recognize that voice, don't I?

<blank>

"......!　is, yes!　A power we once needed, but no longer has passed. We give it back to you!"

<blank>

Meechan ad-libbed his lines a bit to accommodate the sudden situation.

They eyeball me and say, "Oh, don't change it so abruptly," but it's not me.

<blank>

God?　Why are you interrupting?　Hey.

<blank>

'O children of the Dwarves, I will miss you a little, but I am very glad. I am a little sad, but very glad.

<blank>

As she said this, a white cloud came down in the shape of a girl's hand with a gust of wind.

It is a girl's hand in shape, but it is the arm of a gigantic god.

The hand picks up the "Breaking Wall Hammer" as if picking up a pebble and returns to the sky.

<blank>

'I certainly got it back. Be of good cheer, children of the Dwarves, and continue to be of good health.'

<blank>

The voice of God in a good mood. Immediately after that, something popped!　and the sound of something popping.

A ball of light fell on the dwarves' village, and a round rainbow like a circle of angels spread across the sky.

<blank>

No, if it's a rainbow, it's probably something else because it's ignoring the sun too much. ......

<blank>

And I was able to move.

<blank>

<blank>

Ha, I can move ......!"

"...... Sir?　What's wrong?　I mean, are you all right?　You are sweating profusely.

<blank>

If you ask me if I'm okay, I'm as tired as I would be after using a lot of magic-consuming duplicates.

<blank>

...... now, that wasn't me."

What do you mean?"

'God, yes. You've probably done a lot with my body. ......"

<blank>

......

Wait a minute, isn't God intercepting this?

It's for 1000 SP!

<blank>

The mee-chan on the platform said, "It's a miracle of God!　Ooooooooo!" and shouted to raise the tension, while the people raised their drinking cups in a toast.

<blank>

Then I ran to the church. With my back to the gazes of Mee-chan and the others, who were looking at me like they wanted to complain.

If this was a decision to take over the game, I'm going to give it a hard time, even if I'm playing against a god!

(I'm thinking of releasing a new one at Kakuyom-Kon, so my update pace may slow down.)
