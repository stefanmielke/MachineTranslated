# I urge the bad guys to reflect on their actions☆ (from a thug's point of view) ●Illustrations

(Happy New Year!!!)

The woman was just a prey that had wandered into the alley.

It was a catch, it had to be. A little threat and a little money on the table, no, it's not a bad idea to let me have a little fun. I'm sure they'd feel good about it, since they get to play with me.

<blank>

When I called out to them,

<blank>

I'm getting tired of the pattern. Do you have a manual?　Come on already, mook."

I'll kill you and play with your corpse!"

I'm so scared! I'm going to pee my pants!

<blank>

The woman laughed at me like I was an idiot.

I can't stand it, I was going to keep it because it's not bad looking, but I'm going to kill it!

<blank>

I swung the square timber in my hand at her, and she couldn't even react to my attack.

<blank>

--the square timber shattered.

<blank>

My hands are chattering and numb from the recoil, as if I had just bopped a giant rock.

<blank>

Is it ......?　Huh?"

"Yes, it was self-defense!"

What the fuck are you--?

<blank>

At the moment I thought, the view I was looking at instantly changed to total darkness.

Suddenly the lights went out, but we seemed to be in a large place with a good view of the stars.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

What happened, what did they do?　What did they do to you?

<blank>

What is this?　What the hell is this?

What the hell did you do?　Oh!

"Oh no! Is that ......, or is that you, Balad?"

<blank>

There were other people around, besides me.

As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I realize that the men around me look somewhat familiar and that I am in an abandoned building. What the hell is this?

<blank>

At that moment, only our surroundings were suddenly illuminated by a crackling light, and I squinted.

Is it light magic? Only here, it seems to be a cropped daytime.

<blank>

Yes, yes, everyone. Chumoku."

"Aah!　You--uh, ah ......?"

<blank>

Under the sun-like light, I look in the direction of the voice.

That voice is definitely the woman I was tangling with earlier.

<blank>

The guy was standing in empty air.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What the fuck did you ...... do? --What the hell did you do to me?　Ugh!

<blank>

Just as I was about to walk up to him to punch him, my legs stopped moving as if they were sewn to the ground. And I couldn't move my upper body, not even a finger.

The only freedom is from the neck up.

<blank>

What is this?　What the hell is this?　Help!"

Aaaaah!"　You've got to be kidding me!"

No, why?　Help me, big brother!"

<blank>

In the ruins, none of the men could move, and they were all screaming.

<blank>

Well, I'm going to have to ask you all to kill each other. "Yes. Do you believe in God?

<blank>

Huh?　What is this guy talking about?

Everyone here must have thought so.

<blank>

God is angry with you. It's because you are bad people. Didn't they teach you not to bother people?　Hmm?

"Shut up, shut up--"

"Right now, you're giving us a lot of trouble..."

Is this your doing?　Bukkill--"

<blank>

The voices of those who raised their voices are heard in a pitter-patter.

<blank>

God is always looking at you with amusement. I was wondering how to punish you... ...... and that's why He sent me.

<blank>

A crazy woman pointing herself with a thumbs up thump.

<blank>

The current situation is a ton too stupid to say - and I'm not saying it's stupid.

We were supposed to be in an alleyway, but this ruin. We were brought to this place in the blink of an eye. What should we call this without calling it an act of God? No way, is it real?

<blank>

Raise your hand if you are sorry. We'll keep going until all of you are sorry and swear to turn yourselves in!　It's a joint responsibility!

What about?"

<blank>

As soon as the woman said that, we floated up and our feet left the ground.

It is floating. No, we are flying!　We are flying up into the sky at great speed.

You can turn your body around so that your face is toward the ground.

<blank>

It is high. And since only the ground was clear and bright as daylight, the height could be seen clearly.

<blank>

It was as if I had become a bird - or so I thought, when I realized that the ground was approaching at a great speed.

<blank>

It's falling!

<blank>

Aaaaahhhhhh!"

Aaaaahhhhhh!"

'I'm dying, I'm dying!　Dying, dying!"

<blank>

The wind is all over you. The dark ground was rapidly approaching. At that moment, the car came to a stop, just a finger's distance away from the ground.

<blank>

Ha, ha ......?"

<blank>

I was in a cold sweat.

I thought I was going to die, I thought I was dead.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ...... nn, I can't hear you?　One more sec!"

"Oh ......?　Ah!

<blank>

The ground moving away from us. We are rising again.

<blank>

"What ...... what ......?"

<blank>

When it is high enough, as high as it was before - drop ......!

<blank>

AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

Hiiiiiiiiii ！！！！"

"was, was, was sorry, sorry aaaaaaah!　Aaahhhh ！！！！"

<blank>

It's a ground thresher and a pitter-patter. ......

<blank>

This, this is something that comes ...... but not so much that it is unbearable ...... if you know it will definitely stop!

<blank>

Oh my arm, my arm, my arm!

Oh, no. Sorry, I got a little out of hand and made a mistake. Let me fix it, okay?"

Gee, ahhh! ...... ah?　Eh, ah?"

Yes, it's fixed. Oh, it's hard. If I make a mistake a few times, I won't be able to fix it. I hope they'll all be sorry before that happens.

<blank>

...... Apparently, this forced "punishment" of being pushed off a cliff is not safe.

<blank>

I'm sorry!　I'll turn myself in, I'll turn myself in!"

"Oh, me too, help me!"

Oh. You're a good boy, but not all of you, so it's one more time!　One more sec!"

<blank>

As soon as he said that, we were rising again.

<blank>

Noaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa！！！！"



"----......"

"Oh, hey. Is anyone else fainting?"

I'm not sure. ...... says it will continue until everyone is sorry. ......"

Hey, you don't mean we can't finish this if someone blacks out, do you?　You don't mean we can't end this if someone blacks out, do you!"

<blank>

After that, we were forced to continue the dive until the sun rose and we could all say together, "I'm sorry, I'm turning myself in" - "one more sec" again if we were even slightly off - until the sun came up.

<blank>

All of them were fecally disfigured and in a state of hail - but as a result, none of them were dead and none of them were injured.

<blank>

Good, good, you've all reflected on that!　Well, it was a good thing it was already daybreak and I was getting sleepy too. I almost let them all slip away. It was a lot more work than I thought it would be."

<blank>

It's too scary. With such a statement, we found ourselves being rolled out of the town of Solacidore.

<blank>

Don't mention me at ......." You guys remember my face, don't you?　Then break it up!"

<blank>

We were dizzy, and the words finally freed us, and we cried.

<blank>

"One last time here?　One more--"

「「「「「「I'm sorry ahhh!　I'm turning myself in..................！！！！」」」」」」

<blank>

Breathlessly, everyone raises their hands and shouts.

<blank>

If someone doesn't turn himself in or confess to a crime, I'm going to kidnap him again, so I'm going to do that. If someone doesn't turn himself in or confess to a crime, I'll kidnap him again. You're going to tell me everything you know about not only your own crimes, but other people's crimes as well. Understand?"

<blank>

I heard a tongue-lashing and a reminder.

Needless to say, we then forgot to clean ourselves up and went to turn ourselves in.

If anyone tried to escape, I would have grabbed them by the neck and dragged them away, but fortunately we all felt the same way.

(By the way, I read your comments just fine!　It's very encouraging!

I have replied to comments on the Kakuyom version because there are not so many comments,

(I'm not going to include illustrations and foreword/afterword because of that. Yeah.)
