# Evidence over argument. Hmph! ●Illustration included

The contract magic was simple and finished quickly.

There was nothing like a mark of the contract appearing on my right hand.

On the contrary, I was a bit taken aback, wondering if this was really enough to exchange a single human.

However, it seems that the various guild certificates will now have an item for owned slaves added. I’ll have to go through the procedures at the Adventurers' Guild and the Merchants' Guild later. It's a hassle.

<b>

“I’ll consider it provisional for now, so please come back once you’re healed.”

“Ah, that’s fine. It’s more troublesome to postpone, so go ahead and proceed with the store’s procedures. I probably won’t be returning it.”

“Y-yes… well, if that’s okay.”

<b>

If they can’t heal her, then I’ll just use her as a test subject for treatment until she can be healed.

If I can heal her, then I will… If I fail and she dies, then that can’t be returned either, and there’s no doubt that I won’t be returning her.

<b>

So, the purchase of the slave is complete.

I immediately took the slave girl back to my base to begin treatment.

“Alright then, let’s get started on the healing. Um, where should I start… let’s go with the throat. It’s better if she can talk.”

“Um, Miss. Can you really heal me?”

“What’s this, Dia-kun? Are you doubting my magic? …Speaking of which, I’ve only shown you the storage space and the magic circle copy printing, haven’t I?”

<b>

It’s no wonder she would doubt if I can heal her. I’d be surprised too if someone said, “The container and the copier can perform surgery.”

<b>

“Well, evidence over argument. Hmph!”

<b>

I firmly grasped the slave girl’s throat and focused on spatial awareness. Using my own vocal cords as a reference, I adjusted and corrected the keloid areas. Good.

<b>

“Okay, first the throat. Can you make a sound?”

“Geh, eh, ah, go, eh…”

“Next, the face. I don’t know what her original face looked like, but I’ll accept requests for corrections.”

<b>

I unwrapped the bandages from her face and first repaired the scars. I fixed the areas that had been burned… hmm, it’s hard to know how to fix it without knowing the original face… ah, if she’s a half-dwarf, I’ll use Sati-tan’s face as a reference. She’s pale, but she must have had some dwarf-like features originally.

Her eyes are a bit burned too, so I’ll fix those. Smoothly done.

I’ll also replicate and increase the hair… I think that’s about it. She has red hair, so she definitely looks like Sati-tan. I might have leaned a bit too much towards her.

<b>

“Ah, eh?”

“Now, the arms. I’ll go ahead and fix the body too.”

<b>

Before, I made legs using the hands as a reference, but this time I’ll make arms using the legs as a reference.

Well, the dexterity might decrease, but let’s consider it rehabilitation. Alright, here we go. Right arm complete, left arm complete with a mirrored copy.

While I’m at it, I’ll remove the lewd graffiti-like tattoos on her body and clean up the old scars. The cellular copying is going smoothly.

<b>

“Phew, operation complete. …Two arms are quite tiring.”

“Eh, ah, thank you for your hard work, Karina-onee-san.”

“…Huh? Huh…?”

<b>

The two of them are dumbfounded by the speed of my work.

Look at that, Karina-onee-san’s high-speed operation. I didn’t even give the patient a chance to lie down.

<b>

“Well, for today, just take it easy and get accustomed.”

<b>

…Though I tried to sound cool, I’m definitely feeling a bit dizzy!

I really need to look into whether I can make mana potions. The alchemy textbook I got from Verald only had information about creating magical tools, so it seems I’ll need a different book for pharmaceuticals.

<b>

“I can speak, I have arms…! Ah, my face, oh…!”

“Well, if your voice, face, and arms aren’t in good shape, it’ll affect your work.”

“Ah, thank you! I’m grateful, Master! Thank you!! Geh, cough!”

“Ah, ah, don’t push yourself right after being healed. I told you to take it easy.”

<b>

The slave girl sincerely thanks me. …However! I will not be swayed! I will not be swayed!

Remember the lesson from Senior Shildon! One must act under the assumption that slaves will betray you!

<b>

…Phew, alright.

<b>

“By the way, slave girl, I didn’t catch your name. You can choose what to call yourself.”

“Eh, then please call me Aishia, Master.”

“Okay, Aishia. You’ll be serving me for the rest of your life, so from now on, don’t lie to me or Dia-kun except with your own name. That’s an order.”

“Understood, Master. I will serve you for life.”

<b>

She seems to have a high level of loyalty, but it’s probably just a high from being healed.

Since I’ll be making her do unpleasant work from now on, it could easily change.

One must not trust a slave…!

<b>

<b>

“Dia-kun, I’m going to take a break, so I’ll leave the rest to you. I’ll leave some food here, so teach her the rules of this place. …Slave girl, make sure to listen to what Dia-kun says. You must not go against him. Also, if there’s anything you want adjusted, let me know later. There’s a mirror and such too.”

<b>

With that, I returned to my room and collapsed onto my bed.

…Ah, I really want new bedding instead of used pirate ones.
