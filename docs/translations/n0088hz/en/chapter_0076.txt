# Proof of the argument. Hm! ● Illustration Ali.

The contract magic was quick and easy.

There is no such thing as a sign of a contract on the right hand side.

On the other hand, is this enough to exchange a single human being?　I was so disappointed.

However, I hear that the various guild certificates will have more items for owned slaves. I have to go to the Adventurer's Guild and the Merchant's Guild for the procedure later. It's a hassle.

<blank>

We'll call it provisional for now, and you can come back when you're better."

It's better to put it off. It's more trouble than it's worth. I probably won't return it."

Ha, ha." ...... Well, if that's all right."

<blank>

If they can't be cured, they can't be cured, they'll just be experimented on for treatment until they are cured.

If you heal until you are cured, you will be cured ...... If you fail and die, that's not returnable and I'm 100% sure you won't return it.

<blank>

So, the purchase of slaves is complete.

I immediately decided to take the slave child back to my base and treat him.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Well, then, let's get on with it. Let's see, let's start with the ...... throat. I'd rather be able to talk."

Um, sister. Are you sure you can fix this?"

What is it, Dear, are you doubting my magic? ......, I've only shown you this storage space and a photocopy printout of the magic circle.

<blank>

No wonder then that I doubt I can fix it. If someone said to me, "I can operate a container and a copier," I would say, "How?" I would say, "How?

<blank>

Well, the proof is in the pudding. Hmph!"

<blank>

I grasp the slave's throat gingerly and grasp the space. Using my own vocal cords as a reference, I fix the keloided area with a nice trim. Good.

<blank>

"Hi, throat first. Can you speak?"

"Gee, eh, ah, go, eh ......"

Next, the face. I don't know the original face, but I'll accept your order for correction.

<blank>

Unwrap the bandages on the face and repair the scars first. Fix the area that was burned...... hmmm, how can I fix it if I don't know the original face...... Oh, let's refer to Sati-tan's face if she is half-dwarf. This one is pale, but, well, it must have been dwarf-like originally.

My eyes are a little burned too, I'll fix them. I'll fix it.

I duplicated and increased the hair part as well. ...... I think it's a little too close to Sati's hair. I may have made it a little too close.

<blank>

Oh, what?"

Then the arm. I'll fix your body, too.

<blank>

Before, I made the legs with reference to the hands, now I make the arms with reference to the legs.

Well, your dexterity may go down, but good luck with your rehabilitation. Right arm completed, left and right reversed copy, left arm completed.

And while we're at it, let's also remove the obscene graffiti-like tattoos on the body and heal the old wounds. Cellular copying will progress.

<blank>

I'm so tired of having two arms. I'm really tired of having two ...... arms.

Eh, oh, thank you for your help, sister Karina."

"...... what?　What? ......?"

<blank>

The two are taken aback by how quickly they did it.

What a high-speed operation by Ms. Karina. She didn't even give the patient time to lie down.

<blank>

Well, you'll get used to it for now."

<blank>

I'm cool with ......, but I'm wobbly as a rock!

I still need to find out if it is possible to make mana potions or something like that. The alchemy instruction book I got in Velarde only wrote about making magic tools, so I think I need a different book for medicine.

<blank>

"Voice, out, arms, there ......!　Oh, face, oh, oh ......!"

That's because you have to have a strong voice, face, and arms to do your job well."

Oh, thank you very much!　Thank you, Aruji-sama!　Thank you very much!　Gee, eh!"

He said, "Ahhhh, you just got better, so don't push yourself. You told me to get used to it."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Slave who earnestly thanks you. ...... but!　I will not bond!　I won't be bonded!

Remember the lesson of Shildon senior!　Slaves should act on the premise of betrayal!

<blank>

...... Whew, okay.

<blank>

He said, "Well, slave, you didn't tell me your name. You can decide for yourself what you want to call yourself."

"Eh, well, then, please call me Isiah, Aruji-sama."

I'm going to have you work for me for the rest of your life. You will serve me for the rest of your life, so don't lie to me or Dear by any other name than your own from now on, that's an order."

I will serve you for the rest of my life. I will serve you for the rest of my life.

<blank>

Loyalty seems high, but it is probably only a high from the treatment.

As long as we are going to make them do work they don't want to do, we can turn them over as many times as we want in the future.

Don't trust slaves. ......

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to take a break and take care of the rest. I'll leave some food on the table and tell you the rules of this place. ...... slave, listen to what Deere says. Don't disobey him. And let me know later if you want me to make any adjustments. We have mirrors and stuff.

<blank>

With that, I went back to my room and fell unsteadily to my bunk.

...... Oh, I still want new bedding, not pirate secondhand.
