# Target found.

<blank>

The blonde-haired, white-robed woman in front of me was taking some notes while looking at me.

<blank>

"...... I need to talk to you for a minute. Okay?"

'Fine, but are you the true God of Chaos?'

Well, that's what they call it."

<blank>

Oh. Target found. ...... Oh, no. This cage is blocking spatial magic. I can see it and hear it, but the spatial magic can't reach the other side of the cage.

You can go to ...... base. Hmmm, I have no idea what kind of technology, but I'll do it...true chaos god.

<blank>

"Okay, come on over here and let's talk about it. Isn't it unfair that only one of us is in a cage?"

You're the ones who came in here on your own. I don't care if you've fallen into the pit properly and are naked, just showing your face to a well-equipped trespasser is better than nothing. I mean, you're also slaughtering modified lizardmen, so it's robbery-murder, robbery-murder."

What?　Isn't this a dungeon?"

"It's a man-made dungeon, a man-made dungeon, made by the Alchemy Kingdom. The lizardman lying there also had a prototype control device implanted in his head, didn't he?"

<blank>

Artificial dungeons!　Is there such a thing?

Does that mean we can install lasers that turn only those clothes into dice steaks as we wish?　I can dream of creating all the erotic trap dungeons I want. ......

<blank>

'All right, then, now that you've convinced me, let's talk. You're the devil's minion."

Wait. In case you're wondering, I'm not the devil's pawn, am I?"

I think "robber-killer ...... would be an appropriate term to use if you're looking at it as a monster demon who kills?　And if you're talking about a term of endearment for the god of a hostile faction, I think demon is more appropriate than you might think. Well, I don't care either way."

<blank>

That's for sure. Damn, I've been debunked by the true God of Chaos.

<blank>

Nyah-nyah, can I have a word?"

Hmm?"　What's up Misha. You want me to rub your ass?"

Hmm?"　What's up, pink cat lady? Want to sniff some matatabi?"

You guys are breathing perfectly! ...... No, what are you talking about, God or the devil?　I have no idea what you're talking about.

<blank>

Hey, Misha. What have you been listening to all this time?　I mean, you've been following me all this way, what are you saying now?

<blank>

'Well, I don't have a choice, let me explain again. ...... I was ordered by God to come and get this guy who calls himself the God of Chaos. It's a felony for a god to take on the name of his lover without permission, and that's how the previous alchemy kingdom was destroyed."

I see, Carina, God sent you.

What about?"　Just saying your girlfriend's name is out, that's a hell of an arachnid soul, isn't it? ...... hmmm ...... that kinda messes up the premise a little bit, but acceptable, huh?"

<blank>

I close my eyes and hold my head down. What in the world was unexpected?

<blank>

Let's see. Let's talk about the situation over here at ....... This one has been told by God that you are a demon that destroys the world, and I'm being asked to protect this world."

"...... hmm?　God?"

I guess he's not the same God as yours. If it's the same being, he's a pretty bad actor, ha ha."

<blank>

Apparently there is another God behind that one.

Well, the truth is that there is not always one God. At the same time, though, it could be a fake God. ......

<blank>

'By the way, you said the name of the god of chaos was a no-no, didn't you?　The more I hear about it, the more convinced I am that this camp is trying to frame me. I'd like to ...... turn over to you."

<blank>

Hmm?　Hmm?

<blank>

I just want to make sure I'm not missing something that was said, okay?"

Of course. Ask me anything."

...... You just said "I" in the first person, didn't you?　Don't tell me you're a man dressed as a woman!　Are your boobs fake?

"Of all places, that's the one!　There's more to it than that!"

<blank>

No, because it's quite important!　In terms of my motivation!
