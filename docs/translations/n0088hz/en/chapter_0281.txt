# Target discovered.

<b>

The blonde woman in a white coat in front of me was looking at me while taking some notes.

<b>

"……I want to talk a little. Is that okay?"

"Sure, but are you the true Chaos God?"

"Well, that's what I'm called."

<b>

Oh. Target discovered. …Oops, that's not good. This cage is blocking spatial magic. I can see and hear her, but spatial magic can't reach beyond the cage.

…Moving to the base is possible. Hmm, I have no idea what kind of technology this is, but well done, true Chaos God.

<b>

"Okay, then let's talk, so come over here a bit. It's unfair for only one of us to be inside the cage, right?"

"Don't be stupid. You guys came in here on your own. It's one thing if you fell into a pit and ended up naked, but just showing your face to well-equipped trespassers is already a big deal. Besides, you've also massacred modified lizardmen, so it's robbery and murder, robbery and murder."

"Huh? Isn't this a dungeon?"

"It's an artificial dungeon made by the Alchemy Kingdom. The lizardman lying there also had a prototype control device embedded in its head, right?"

<b>

An artificial dungeon! So those exist too!

Does that mean they can freely set up lasers that turn just that outfit into diced steak? The possibilities for creating erotic trap dungeons are expanding...

<b>

"Alright, now that we've established some understanding, let's talk. You, servant of the devil."

"Wait. Just to clarify, I'm not a servant of the devil, I think?"

"Robbery and murder… I think calling you a monster killer is also an appropriate expression, right? And if we're talking about how to address a god from an opposing faction, then calling you a devil might actually be quite fitting. Well, either way is fine."

<b>

That's certainly true. Damn it, I've been out-argued by the true Chaos God.

<b>

"Meow meow, can I ask something?"

"Huh? What's up, Misha? Do you want me to rub your butt?"

"Huh? What's up, pink cat lady? Want to smell some catnip?"

"You two are in perfect sync, huh!! …No, what are you talking about with gods and devils? I don't understand at all and it's boring."

<b>

Hey, Misha. What have you been listening to until now? And why are you asking this now after following me all the way here??

<b>

"I guess I have no choice but to explain again. …I was ordered by the god to capture someone claiming to be the Chaos God. Apparently, it's a serious crime to take on the name of a lover without permission, and that's why the previous Alchemy Kingdom was destroyed."

"I see, so you were a messenger of Goddess Karina."

"Huh? Just taking on a lover's name is a no-go? That's quite a wild spirit. …Hmm… This changes the premise a bit, but is it within the acceptable range?"

<b>

I close my eyes and hold my head. What exactly was unexpected?

<b>

"Um, let's see. …I'll share our side of the story too. We've been told by the god that you're a devil who destroys worlds, and we want you to protect this world."

"…Huh? A god?"

"Different from the god on your side, I suppose. If they were the same being, that would be quite a troublesome self-made performance, haha."

<b>

It seems there is also a god on their side.

Well, it's true that there isn't just one god. At the same time, there's also the possibility of it being a false god...

<b>

"By the way, you said the name of the Chaos God is a no-go, right? Hearing that, I'm even more convinced that your side is trying to set me up. …I want to switch sides."

<b>

Huh? Huh?

<b>

"I heard something I can't just let slide, so I want to confirm it, is that okay?"

"Of course, ask me anything."

"…Just now, you referred to yourself as 'ore,' right? You can't possibly be a cross-dressing boy, can you!? Are those breasts fake!?"

"Of all things, that's what you're focused on!? There were so many other things to talk about!?"

<b>

No, it's actually quite important! For my motivation!!
