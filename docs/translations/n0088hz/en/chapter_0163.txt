# Let's show off to Mashiro-san.

<b>

<b>

I ran into Mashiro-san after her bath at the base.

Since I have the chance, I should show off the equipment I got from Aisia's hometown to Mashiro-san.

<b>

“Mashiro-saan! Look, look, I got a bunch of things from Aisia's hometown!”

“Oh, it seems like you got a lot of stuff.”

“Look at this, it's a revolver. I can shoot it like crazy with dual-wielding!”

<b>

I took the gun out of the holster and aimed it sideways. I don't point it at people.

<b>

“A gun, huh? It's quite different from what the Beebays had.”

“That one was more of a concealed weapon among guns.”

<b>

At least compare it to a musket. Pirates used those too.

<b>

“This one is a special model that can shoot six times.”

“That's amazing. Does it work on monsters?”

“It depends on where you hit. The wounds are small and harder to take down than with a rapier, but it has power.”

“Well, Karina has magic too, so... more importantly.”

<b>

Mashiro-san's gaze was focused on the pouch, ring, and hair accessory.

By the way, the cup and knife are in the pouch.

<b>

“Fufufu, you have a good eye. This is a gift I received from a local wife in the Dwarf village.”

“A local wife from the Dwarves... What are you doing???”

“Something like, it just happened?”

<b>

Tehepero.

<b>

“Is it like, if you receive a confident work from a Dwarf, you get married? I heard it's like that. But it's not such a heavy thing. It's not like I'm being bound or anything.”

“Oh, I see... So, since you didn't return it, that means you accepted it.”

“Well, she was cute, and I had no reason to refuse. ...Also, I have this cup and knife!”

“Wow, five of them... Wait, hold on. Hey, what is this? Huh? Wait a minute?”

<b>

Mashiro-san, who was staring intently at the gifts from the Five Elders, started to look confused.

<b>

“...Did the person who made this, happen to be an incredible craftsman? I can sense the magic enhancement.”

“That's right. By the way, the materials are Arthur-kun's fangs and scales.”

“So that means it's dragon material!? No wonder it has magic enhancement! And a Dwarf craftsman, no, this isn't just that. This is an incredible... super incredible craftsman. Even I, an A-rank adventurer, couldn't get my hands on this.”

“Oh yeah, I heard they're called the Five Elders.”

“Th-the Five Elders!?”

<b>

Mashiro-san coughed. Gah, cough, she choked.

Are you okay? Do you want some water? You can use the cup.

<b>

“Y-you mean... the Five Elders... such big shots were at Aisia's place...”

“Would you like to get something made next time, Mashiro-san? I can introduce you.”

“Idiot, I can't pay the commission fee!! No, wait, I'll save up. I will definitely save up, so please introduce me then!!”

<b>

Huh? Wait a minute. Mashiro-san is an A-rank adventurer, right?

And she can't just pay the commission fee? How high is it?

<b>

“So, which of the Teshin Five Elders did you charm?”

“Huh? They're the Five Elders, though.”

“So, out of the Five Elders, who was it?”

“Huh? I told you, they're the Five Elders.”

<b>

Mashiro-san froze.

<b>

“Wait. Hey, wait. Could it be that those five incredible pieces of equipment...”

“They each made one for me! All five of them were super cute little girls, you know? Well, actually, they're not really little girls, but I don't really understand Dwarf ages, so to me, they're little girls.”

“Show me the engravings! If they're confident works, they should have their names on them!”

<b>

Engravings. If it's a proposal item, it seems normal to have your name on it.

So, I showed Mashiro-san the five pieces of equipment... Oh, so that's where the engraving was.

<b>

“The Five Elders... all of them... Seriously?”

“Oh. They said if I didn't want them, I could sell them to cover my travel expenses, but I'm definitely not selling them!!”

<b>

Since they're marked, even if they're stolen, I can get them back.

<b>

But I could lend them to Mashiro-san if she wants.

I have space magic, so I don't really need the equipment, but for Mashiro-san, the pouch, knife, hair accessory, cup, and ring would be useful.

<b>

But there wasn't anything that wasn't useful.

<b>

“...I'm kind of scared that if I borrow them, I'll incur their wrath.”

“They're all cute and nice, so that won't happen. Mashiro-san is one of my important people! I especially like this ring, do you want to try it on?”

“W-well, just for a moment...”

<b>

Just as Mashiro-san was about to slip the ring onto her finger.

<b>

The ring disappeared.

<b>

“Huh? Wait!? The ring disappeared!?”

“Hey, Karina, your finger.”

<b>

Where Mashiro-san pointed, the ring had returned to my left hand's ring finger.

<b>

“...Phew. I see, it must have a theft prevention feature, huh? So that's why they said it was okay to sell it.”

“If it comes back after being sold, that's a free-for-all. Don't sell it... no, wait. Hey.”

<b>

By the way, I could lend everything except the ring, but if I didn't declare that I was lending them, they would automatically return to me if taken a certain distance away.

This is definitely because I used my potion as a secret ingredient. No doubt about it.

<b>

“Probably, the ring comes back quickly because it's life-threatening. A feature that loves you! Ah, how cute. I love them all!”

“Is that really okay with you!? ...Cursed equipment... well, if you say it's fine, then okay. So, it's covered in spit, huh? You're liked too much... Seriously, what did you do...”

<b>

Cursed equipment? No, no, it's at most a curse. They're little girls, after all.

Selling that would be outrageous! Or something like that.
