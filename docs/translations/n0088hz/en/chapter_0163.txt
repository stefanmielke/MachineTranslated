# I'll brag to Mr. Mashiro.

<blank>

<blank>

At the base, I ran into Masilo-san after his bath.

Since this is a good opportunity, I should brag to Mr. Masilo about the equipment I acquired in Aisia's hometown.

<blank>

Masilo, look what I got in Isiah's hometown!　Look, look, I got all kinds of stuff in Isiah's hometown!"

"Oh, there's a lot more going on."

Look, look, here's a revolver pistol. I'm going to shoot bang bang with two revolver pistols!"

<blank>

Take the gun out of the holster and hold it at your side. Do not point it at anyone.

<blank>

"A gun. It's a lot different from the one Beebe and his friends had."

'That was more of a gun that was biased towards being a concealed weapon.

<blank>

At least compare it to a musket gun. The one the pirates used too.

<blank>

This one is specially made for six-shooters.

That's great. Does it work on demons?"

It depends on where you hit it. The wounds are smaller and harder to kill than a rapier, but they are more powerful.

'Well, Karina has magic too. ...... than that."

<blank>

Jeez, Masilo's eyes were focused around the pouch, ring and hair ornament.

The cup and knife are in the pouch, by the way.

<blank>

"Well, you have a good eye. Here is a present I received from a local wife in a dwarven village."

"You're the Dwarf's ...... local wife. What are you doing?

It just kind of happened, didn't it?"

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

<blank>

It's like, "Dwarves present you with a gift that they are proud of, and if you accept it, you will marry them.　I guess so. But it's not that heavy. It's not like they're restraining you.

I'm not going to go back and say, "Oh, that's what I meant. "So, if you're at ...... and you're not poking back, that means you've accepted it."

'Well, he was cute, and I had no reason to say no. ...... and I also have cups and knives like these!"

I'm not sure if you're talking about ...... or not. Hey, this one, huh?　Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

<blank>

Mr. Masilo, who was gazing at the gift he received from the Five Elders, begins to be puzzled.

<blank>

I'm thinking, "Isn't that a hell of a craftsman who made this ......? I can feel the magic grant."

I'm sure it is," he said. By the way, the material was Arthur's fangs and scales."

I mean, it's dragon material!　That's right, it's also loaded with magic grants!　The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your investment is to make sure that it's worth it. Even I, an A rank adventurer, can't get my hands on this.

I heard they are called the Five Elders. I heard they're called the Five Elders or something."

The Five Elders!

<blank>

Mr. Masirow choked. He gulped and gulped.

Are you okay?　Do you want some water?　You can use a glass.

<blank>

"Oh ......, the Five Elders? ...... such a big name was in Isiah's place?"

I'd like to introduce you to some people.　I can introduce you."

I can't pay the commission, you idiot!　No, wait, I'll save up. I'll save up, I'll save up, and then you'll introduce me!

<blank>

Hmm?　Wait a minute. Mr. Masirow is an A-rank adventurer, right?

So how expensive is it that they can't just ponce off the request fee?

<blank>

"So, who of the Five Elders of Tessin did you hit on?"

What?　I'm one of the Five Elders."

So, who among the Five Elders?

What?　So, the Five Elders."

<blank>

Mr. Masiello froze.

<blank>

Hey, wait. Hey, wait. Maybe it's the five pieces of crazy equipment ......."

You made one for each of us!　All five of them are very cute Lolita, you know?　Well, actually, they're not Lolita, but I don't really know how old Dwarves are, so they're Lolita to me."

"Let me see your name!　If you're making confidence, you're in it!"

<blank>

inscription. Surely if it's a proposal gift, it's more normal to put your name on it.

And I show Masilo the five pieces of equipment: ...... Heh, I didn't know they were inscribed in that place.

<blank>

The Five Elders ...... all ...... for real."

He said, "Oh, I'll sell it if I don't need it to cover my travel expenses. He said if I didn't need it, I could sell it to help pay for the trip, but I would never sell it!"

<blank>

It's marked, so even if it's stolen, I can put it back in my possession.

<blank>

But you can lend it to Mr. Masilo.

I myself have spatial magic, so all the equipment I don't have to use, but for Masilo, a pouch, a knife, a hair ornament, a cup, a ring, etc. would be useful.

<blank>

There wasn't one that wasn't convenient to use.

<blank>

I'm afraid if I borrow something from ...... I'm going to incur your wrath."

They're all so cute and nice. Masilo is one of my special people!　I especially like this ring or this one, do you want to try it on for a minute?"

Okay, well, just a little ......"

<blank>

And just as Masilo-san was about to slip his finger through the ring to try it out.

<blank>

The ring disappeared.

<blank>

Hmm?　Huh?　The ring's gone!

Hey, Karina, finger.

<blank>

Mr. Masiello pointed to where I was. On my left ring finger, the ring was back.

<blank>

You say, "...... hoh. I see, anti-theft feature?　That's why you said I could sell it."

'Sell and then come back, or sell all you can. Don't sell it, not ....... Oy."

<blank>

By the way, except for the ring, if I declared that I would lend it to him and gave it to him, he could lend it to me, but otherwise, if I held it at some distance from me, it seemed to automatically come back to my hand.

I'm pretty sure the secret ingredient in this is my potion, and it's working. I'm sure of it.

<blank>

'Maybe the ring will come right back to you because it's life-threatening. Love is a happy spec!　Ha, how cute is that? I love you guys."

'You're okay with that! ...... cursed equipment...... No, if you want it to be good, fine. I mean, you're getting spit on all over the place, and. They like you too much,...... seriously, what's up with that,......?"

<blank>

Cursed equipment?　No, no, it's a curse at best. I'm a loli girl.

It's outrageous to sell that!　And that's the kind of thing.
