# A Little Bit of Effort Goes a Long Way

<b>

Arriving in the town of Rosetta.

The town of Rosetta is located at the foot of the mountains, with streets resembling sun-dried bricks and packed earth. Overall, it has a light reddish-brown hue.

<b>

At the gate, I had Aisia disguise herself as a healer and accompany Arthur-kun, allowing us to enter the town without any issues.

I delivered the letter and received two silver coins as a reward, to be paid later. Pocket money is nice, isn't it?

Even though the soldier was a bit hesitant seeing the dragon, he responded cautiously when I informed him that it was a properly registered familiar.

<b>

<b>

What? How did I register the familiar? I did it in Calcutta. The healer did.

<b>

I, or rather the healer, has a bit of influence with the guild master over there!

A little bit of effort goes a long way.

<b>

I also managed to get a little leeway regarding the registration date of the familiar, so my alibi is perfect.

Honestly, the records on the guild card are surprisingly detailed. The person who made this must definitely be a reincarnator or a transmigrator and a Japanese person.

<b>

<b>

So.

I walk through the town of Rosetta with Dia-kun and Aisia.

Since we’re here, I might as well ask Aisia, who is from this country, about the highlights of the town.

<b>

“Aisia, does Rosetta have any attractions?”

“Hmm, not really. It is indeed one of the larger towns in this country, but compared to the capital, there’s almost nothing. If I had to say, being near the border, it’s easier to get alcohol from the Pavelcanto Kingdom.”

<b>

I see, and that’s not particularly rare for us who came from Pavelcanto.

<b>

“The overall reddish-brown scenery gives a nice feeling of being in a different town, though.”

“That’s a basic feature of this country, so if you stay here long, you’ll quickly get tired of it.”

<b>

Is that so? I guess that’s how it is.

By the way, the capital is mostly built for dwarf sizes, so tall people have to bend down every time they go through doors, which can be cramped.

It seems like it wouldn’t be particularly inconvenient for someone my height.

<b>

“For now, let’s stop by the Adventurers' Guild to complete the delivery request and then check out the Merchants' Guild.”

“As a traveling merchant, it might be more profitable to buy dwarf ‘juice’ here and sell it back in the Pavelcanto Kingdom.”

“That’s impossible since I don’t have a liquor license. It might be safe in the dwarf kingdom, but I’d probably get arrested in Pavelcanto.”

“Oh, right. Sorry for the oversight.”

<b>

In the dwarf kingdom, drinkable alcohol is just ‘flavored water,’ right?

Well, it’s fine to buy that too.

<b>

“Oh, but as Aisia said, since it’s ‘juice’ here, it might be a good idea to buy plenty of Pavelcanto’s ‘juice’ and distribute it in this country!”

“Oh, that’s a great idea, my lord!”

<b>

If it’s for bribery, I wouldn’t mind making duplicates and giving them away for free.

If I’m not selling it, making duplicates is safe!

Besides, it would disappear into stomachs immediately after being gifted, so there would be no evidence left!

<b>

(However, unless you’re a god, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between a duplicate and the original.)

<b>

<b>

So, to be safe, I decided to have Aisia, who is a half-dwarf and good with alcohol, buy some alcoholic beverages, or rather juice, for bribery, and we decided to stay in this town for one night.

<b>

As for accommodation… well, I don’t think it’s necessary. It’s just one night. It’s more troublesome to find a good inn that allows dragons.

I’ll just say we camped out to save money.

<b>

Well, since it’s a town without any particularly notable features, let’s just pass through Rosetta in one night and aim for the next town.

The purpose of this trip is to find the ‘sacred artifact,’ so for now, we’ll head toward the center of this country, the capital.

<b>

I hear that there’s also Aisia and Sati-tan’s hometown along the way, so I’ll save some fun for that part.
