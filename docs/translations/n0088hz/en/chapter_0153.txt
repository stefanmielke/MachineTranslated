# You can take a little bit of a leap of faith.

Arrive in the town of Rosetta.

The town of Rosetta was located at the foot of a mountain, and the streets looked as if they were made of clay bricks and dirt. The overall color is a light reddish brown.

<blank>

At the gate, I had Aisia disguised as a healer to follow Mr. Arthur, and we were able to enter the town without any problems.

I also delivered the letter and got two silver coins postpaid as a reward. Pocket money is nice, isn't it?

The soldier was reluctant to see the dragon, even though it was smaller, but when I told him that it was a registered follower, he responded, albeit timidly.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, what did you do about registering as a follower?ã€€I did, in Carcassa. Mr. Healer.

<blank>

I, or rather, Mr. Healer, am a little bit good with the head of the guild there!

It's a little bit too much to ask.

<blank>

I was also able to get a little flexibility in terms of the registration date for the servant registration, so my alibi is perfect.

Totally, the guild card records are surprisingly detailed. Whoever made this is definitely Japanese, like a reincarnated person or a transferee.

<blank>

<blank>

In.

I walk around the town of Rosetta with Mr. Dear and Isiah.

Since this is a good opportunity, why don't we ask Isiah, who is from this country, about the sights of the town?

<blank>

Isiah, is there anything to see in Rosetta?

It is one of the larger cities in the country, but not nearly as large as the capital. Yes, it is one of the larger towns in the country, but compared to the capital, it is almost nothing. If I had to say, I would say that it's near the border, so it's easy to get liquor from the Kingdom of Pavelkant.

<blank>

I see, and that is not so unusual for those of us from Pavelkant.

<blank>

The whole red clay scene is nice because it makes me feel like I'm in a different town."

It's a basic part of the country, and if you stay here, you'll get tired of seeing it.

<blank>

Oh, so that's how it is.

In addition, the capital city is generally dwarf-sized, so taller people have to bend down to get through doors and other places, which is cramped.

He said that if it is just me, there seems to be no particular inconvenience.

<blank>

I think I'll just stop by the Adventurers' Guild to fulfill the delivery request and then go check out the Merchants' Guild.

As a peddler, it would be more profitable to buy Dwarven 'juice' here and sell it back to the Kingdom of Pavelkant."

I can't do that because I don't have a license to drink. Even if it's safe in Dwarf country, I'm going to get arrested in Pavelkant."

Oh, that's right. Excuse me, please use the exit."

<blank>

In the land of dwarves, the drink you can drink up is 'just flavored water,' right?

Well, that's what I would have bought it for.

<blank>

But, as Isiah said, it's all about the juice here, so maybe we can buy some Pavelkant 'juice' here and then distribute it around the country!"

Oh, that's a good idea, Sir!

<blank>

If it is for bribes, we are not afraid to make duplicates and give them away for free.

If you're not selling it, it's safe to reproduce it!

And since they disappear into the stomach as soon as they are presented, there is no evidence left behind!

<blank>

(But you'd have to be a god to know the difference between a copy and a reproduction.)

<blank>

<blank>

So, just to be safe, I asked Isiah, a half-dwarf and a strong drinker, to buy some liquor, or rather juice, for a bribe, and we decided to spend the night in this town.

<blank>

I don't need to get lodging at ...... yeah, I guess. It's just for one night. It's more trouble to bring dragons and find a nice place to stay.

Let's say we saved money by staying in the field.

<blank>

Well, there is no particular characteristic of the town, so let's pass by Rosetta town quickly after just one night and go on to the next town.

The purpose of this trip is to acquire a "sacred object," so our goal is to get to the center of the country, the capital for the time being.

<blank>

I heard that there is a hometown of Isia and Sati along the way, so let's save a lot of fun for there.
