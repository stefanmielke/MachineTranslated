# A Bits of Truth ●Illustrations

I'm Karina. I've stocked up on lotions and I have no more business in this town!

I left the port town of Velarde--

<blank>

--We decided to call it - and after leaving the gate, we transitioned into the town.

<blank>

No, I have to pretend I'm leaving town now, and it should be about 5-8 days before I get to Solacidore. You know, too much alone time is not so good. You know?

<blank>

Oh, and of course I'm taking delivery requests to Solacidore at the Adventurer's Guild. It's important spending money. My luggage is in the storage space, so I can easily enjoy sightseeing in Velarde.

<blank>

Identification cards are also sealed so that there is no history of money transactions. Seven silver coins, which had been cashed in advance, were the budget for the stay.

After running out, go back to the storage space and relax by yourself until around the time of Solacidore's arrival.

The massager I bought at the alchemy store, no. I'd like to try some toy modifications, too!

<blank>

<blank>

First of all, let's enjoy seafood as if we were in a port town!

Oh, and I'd like to get a pair of girl's socks if possible. And I'd like to get one dose of period-skipping pills: ......

It seems difficult to ask for a sober sock please. I'd be willing to pay for them. I think the ...... shame part is the key.

<blank>

Now, the food stalls!

<blank>

Food stalls are lined up, and the good smell of grilled squid and shellfish wafts through the air. The place was quite crowded.

Oh!　You have scallops! ...... Butter-roasted, you say!　Makes me want soy sauce. ...... And sake.

<blank>

Oh, no, wait?　I don't have soy sauce, but I do have some wine that I rolled up from the pirates yesterday.

I wonder if white wine would go better with the seafood?　Ah, but it's not good to drink outside in the daytime, is it? My drinking habits.

Then it's best to buy freshly grilled scallops here and take them home to drink!

<blank>

"Pops, two of those scallops!　Two of those scallops!"

"Aiyou."

<blank>

I suppressed my desire to eat them right there and then, bought the scallops and quietly pretended to put them in my backpack and put them away in the storage space. Don't forget the camouflage of putting them in a tiny wooden box.

<blank>

"An, why don't you eat here?　I want you to eat it right now while it's still hot."

Hmm?"　Uh, oh. I'm going to bring it back as a souvenir. I'm going to heat it up and eat it when I get home."

I see. But I don't want you to have a stomach ache at that time."

I know.

<blank>

Well, inside, time stands still, so it's all good.

Yeah, I'm glad I bought the backpack after all. It was worth the DIY work to make the wooden box.

<blank>

By the way, where can I buy fresh raw fish?"

"Maybe the morning market, it's over now. ...... Oh, there was a fish store for the general public, in case you were wondering."

Let's go there. Tell me where it is."

"Oh, you know where to find me at ......."

<blank>

The old man tells me a lot of things smoothly, probably because I bought scallops.

Maybe it's because I'm beautiful!　Or both?

<blank>

Thanks!　Oh, do you have any other stalls you'd recommend besides this one?"

Kraken baked goods," he said. The merman grill is so bad, you'd better not touch it."

I don't mind the Kraken because he's a squid, but I certainly don't want to be a merman.

<blank>

And thus, I asked for recommendations at the next stall as well, and bought many seafood items for several people at a time.

...... mmm!

<blank>

There is a beautiful vendor!

<blank>

Oh, miss. Will you buy our iso-nikomi for me, too?　Can you eat that much?"

I'm sure there are plenty of kids with plenty to eat at the destination where I'm delivering the goodies.

Hmmm. Orphanage or somewhere?"

That's about it.

<blank>

She was a beautiful woman with a bandana on her head and shorts that gave her a pirate's touch.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

This is a pretty good SP to expect!

He seemed friendly, and I wondered if I could get a pair of wang socks if I asked him ......, and I started talking to him with my intention.

<blank>

"By the way, nice sister ......, well, I know you'll be surprised that I'm suddenly saying this, but ...... would you be willing to sell me your sister's socks!"

"Hm?　Socks?"

"I'll pay you, ...... that, I need a pair of socks from a beautiful woman to treat my sick sister!"

What kind of disease is that?

<blank>

I think it's probably a headache.

<blank>

'Well, look, do you think it's ingredients for magic potions or something like that?

I see. The material for magic potions. ...... but we can't sell the socks."

I'll pay you in Chinese silver coins, Chinese silver coins!"

I'm wearing sandals. I don't have any socks. Sorry."

"What ...... is ......?"

<blank>

<blank>

I have learned one truth about the world.

Just because she's beautiful doesn't mean she wears socks. ......
