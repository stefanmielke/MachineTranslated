# A Fragment of Truth ● With Illustrations

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. I’ve stocked up on lotion, so I have no more business in this town!

I departed from the port town of Veraldo――

<b>

――or rather, after leaving through the gate, I transferred back into the town.

<b>

No, I need to pretend I left the town now and that I’ll arrive in Solashidore in about 5 to 8 days. You see, having too much free time alone is kind of boring, or rather, not very good. Right?

<b>

Ah, of course, I’ve also taken a delivery request to Solashidore at the Adventurers' Guild. It’s important pocket money, after all. The luggage is stored in my storage space, so I can enjoy sightseeing in Veraldo without a care.

<b>

I’ve sealed my ID to avoid leaving a record of money transactions. The budget for my stay consists of seven silver coins I exchanged for cash in advance.

Once I’ve spent it all, I’ll head back to my storage space and relax until it’s time to arrive in Solashidore.

I want to try out the massage device I bought at the alchemy shop, or rather, I want to experiment with modifying some toys!

<b>

<b>

First, let’s enjoy some seafood, fitting for a port town!

Oh, and if possible, I’d like to get a girl’s socks too. I want to have at least one dose of the period skip medicine……

Asking for socks in a plain way seems difficult. I wouldn’t mind paying for them, though. …The shame part is the key, isn’t it?

<b>

“Alright, let’s hit the stalls!”

<b>

Stalls are lined up, and the delicious smell of grilled squid and shellfish wafts through the air. It’s quite lively.

Oh! They have scallops! …Grilled with butter, huh!? I’m going to want some soy sauce… and some sake.

<b>

Ah, wait a minute? I don’t have soy sauce, but I do have the wine I seized from the pirates yesterday.

Since it’s seafood, maybe white wine would pair better? Ah, but drinking outside like this during the day might not be good for me, considering my drinking habits.

Then, the best option is to buy the freshly grilled scallops here and take them home to enjoy with a drink!

<b>

“Hey there! I’ll take two of those scallops!”

“Sure thing!”

<b>

I suppressed my desire to eat them on the spot, bought the scallops, and pretended to put them in my backpack while actually storing them in my storage space. I didn’t forget to camouflage them in a small wooden box.

<b>

“Hey, aren’t you going to eat them here? I’d like you to eat them while they’re hot.”

“Hm? Ah, yeah. I’m taking them home as a souvenir. I’ll warm them up and eat them later.”

“I see. But if you get a stomachache then, it’s not my problem.”

“I know that.”

<b>

Well, time stops inside, so it’s all good.

Yeah, I’m really glad I bought this backpack. The wooden box I DIYed was worth it too.

<b>

“By the way, where can I buy fresh fish?”

“Probably the morning market, but it’s already over… Oh, there’s a fish shop for regular folks too.”

“Maybe I’ll check it out. Can you tell me where it is?”

“Sure, the location is…”

<b>

Maybe because I bought scallops, the old man is happily sharing various tips with me.

It might be because I’m beautiful! Or maybe it’s both?

<b>

“Thanks! Oh, are there any other recommended stalls around here?”

“Try the Kraken grill. The merman grill is pretty nasty, so you might want to avoid that.”

“Kraken is squid, so that’s fine, but I definitely want to steer clear of the merman, yeah.”

<b>

And so, I asked for recommendations at the next stall and bought a bunch of seafood in portions for several people.

…Hmm!

<b>

There’s a beautiful salesgirl!!

<b>

“Oh, young lady. Are you going to buy our sea stew too? Can you eat that much?”

“There are plenty of hungry kids at the place I’m delivering souvenirs to, so it’s all good!”

“Hmm. An orphanage or something?”

“Well, something like that.”

<b>

She had a bandana on her head and wore shorts, giving off a pirate vibe.

<b>

This could lead to some serious SP!

She seems friendly, and I thought maybe I could get a pair of socks if I asked her… so I gathered my courage and decided to speak up.

<b>

“By the way, lovely lady… um, I think you might be surprised by this sudden request, but… would you sell me your socks?!”

“Hmm!? S-socks?”

“I’ll pay you… um, I need a beautiful lady’s socks for my sick sister’s treatment!”

“What kind of illness is that!?”

<b>

I think it’s probably a mental illness.

<b>

“Well, you know, I think it’s something like materials for a magic potion?”

“Oh, I see. Materials for a magic potion… but I can’t sell my socks.”

“I’ll pay you in middle silver coins!”

“It’s not that! You see, I’m wearing sandals. Besides, I don’t have any fancy socks. Sorry.”

“W-what…?”

<b>

<b>

I learned one truth about the world.

Just because someone is beautiful doesn’t mean they’re wearing socks…!
