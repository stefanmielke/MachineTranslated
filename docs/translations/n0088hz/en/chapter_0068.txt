# I will make a bath.

<b>

"Then, I'll make a light magic tool for the room."

<b>

It's a hassle to adjust just the light from spatial magic itself. It's fine for my room, but it's better if the light in Dia-kun's room can be turned on and off by himself.

<b>

"I'll also make the lights for the bathroom and toilet, so please."

"Yes. That said, the finishing and duplication will be left to Sister Karina."

"Okay, leave it to me!"

<b>

Dia-kun is reliable. That said, there are magic tools that I can't have Dia-kun make for me, so I need to be able to make magic tools myself.

However, for just a massage device, it's healthy, so it's fine to have Dia-kun help me with that.

<b>

"By the way, Dia-kun. I want to miniaturize the massage device we made the other day."

"Miniaturization? Then, while reducing the size of the magic circle, increase the output..."

<b>

It's fine to have Dia-kun help me with just the miniaturization of the massage device!

<b>

<b>

So, I'm having Dia-kun make a magic tool, and I'm making a bath.

Since just denting it wouldn't be enough to call it complete, I'll arrange stones around the edge of the bath to make it look like a hot spring. Stones are relatively easy to find outside. If I look around the river, I can find some that are fairly large and round in no time.

<b>

While selecting stones from the river, a wild boar suddenly attacked.

It looks like tonight's dinner will be wild boar steak. I also want some vegetables.

<b>

"From the area cutter, bloodletting!"

<b>

The wild boar became meat.

...What should I do with this blood? I forcibly extracted a sphere of blood using spatial magic. Throwing it away like this feels a bit like littering.

<b>

"If I throw the organs in the forest, they will become food for animals... but I can't let the scavenger slime eat it, or else it might remember the taste of blood and attack me."

<b>

When camping normally, you don't usually do bloodletting, and even if you do, the usual procedure is to dig a hole in the ground and bury it, as Blade-senpai taught me. This is because it attracts monsters.

It's not a problem to just defeat monsters if they surround me, but well, that's that.

<b>

Well, if I've extracted the wild boar's blood this cleanly, it might be useful for something, so I might as well store it in a storage space. If I store it, it won't rot.

<b>

<b>

...Speaking of blood, maybe I should take the menstrual skip medicine. The limited-time one.

I bought a year's worth, so I can skip the first dose for sure. *gulp*.

"Dia-kun, look! The hot spring-style bath is complete!"

"I've also completed the magic circle for the light magic tool. I've made it so that one magic circle can adjust the brightness continuously!"

"Wow, amazing! You incorporated continuous brightness adjustment into the light magic circle? ...It said in the usual way to divide it into several magic circles, but it can be done in one. Wow, I didn't know that... If you dim it properly, it saves magic power, huh, interesting!"

"Considering maintenance, it's better to separate them, but to save magic stones, it's better to consolidate them as much as possible."

<b>

My Dia-kun is steadily walking the path of magic tools...!

No, I guess it's technically alchemy as a genre? Alchemy is quite broad.

<b>

"Next, I plan to create something that detects the surrounding brightness and automatically adjusts to a certain brightness. The continuous adjustment is a preliminary step."

"It seems like it could also be used to lift loads of different weights to a constant height."

"That's right! I think this can also be applied to golems!"

<b>

Mufu, Dia-kun smiles proudly. He looks cute like an engineering girl. I want to give him a wrench.

<b>

"How's your bath coming along, sister?"

"Yeah, this one has turned out quite charming. Come on over."

<b>

I lead Dia-kun to the bath.

There, I found an open-air bath. To be precise, one wall is a large window, allowing you to enjoy the great outdoors while bathing.

In addition to the bathtub, there is a drain, and the overflow water is being let out into the forest. There's also a space to wash your body.

<b>

"Wow, it's spacious and nice. ...Where is this?"

"It's up the river near Sorashidore. You can't really get in, so it's safe even if monsters come right in front of you."

<b>

It's designed so that it can't be touched or seen from the outside. It's a fixed-point camera.

It might be good to be able to switch to various points around the world. Traveling to find breathtaking views could also be an option.

<b>

"How about it, want to bathe together? I'll wash your back. Oh, but I don't have any soap."

"F-Fah!? Uh, um, I'll pass! N-No, it's not that I dislike it or anything!!"

<b>

Dia-kun, with a bright red face, declines.

It's fun to tease him! I love that about him!
