# I make a bath.

<blank>

Then I'll make a light fixture to light the room.

<blank>

It is troublesome to adjust the light if it is only the light of the space itself by spatial magic. It is better to be able to turn on/off the light in your room by yourself, even if it is only in my room.

<blank>

I'll be lighting the bathrooms and toilets as well, thank you."

Yes, but I'll leave the finishing and duplication to your sister Karina. But I will leave the finishing touches and duplication to your sister Karina."

Yeah, I got it!"

<blank>

You are very reliable, Dia-kun. However, I have my own magical tools that I can't have Dia-kun make for me, so I need to learn to make magical tools too.

However, as for just a massage device, it is healthy and shall be acceptable for Deere to help you.

<blank>

By the way, Dear. I'd like to downsize the massage device I made the other day."

Is it miniaturization?　Then reduce the size of the magic circle, but increase the output. ......"

<blank>

We shall be happy to have Mr. Deere assist in the downsizing of the massage equipment only!

<blank>

<blank>

So, Dia, you make the magical tools and I make the bath.

Since it is hard to call a bath complete just by making a dent in it, we decided to place rocks around the edge of the bath like a hot spring. Stones can be found anywhere outside. If you go outside, you can find large, rounded stones near the river.

<blank>

A wild boar attacked me while I was picking out stones from the river.

It looks like it will be wild boar steak for dinner tonight. I want vegetables, too.

<blank>

"From the area cutter, bleeding out!"

<blank>

The boar became meat.

I wonder what to do with ...... this blood. And the sphere of blood that I forcefully sucked out with spatial magic. I don't feel comfortable throwing it away as it is, as if it were litter.

<blank>

The entrails can be dumped in the woods to feed the animals, but we can't feed them to ...... scavenger slimes, we don't want them tasting blood and attacking us."

<blank>

I was told by Braid senior that when you encamp normally, you don't drain blood that much, and even if you do drain blood, the normal procedure is to dig up the soil, bury it, and throw it away. This is because it would attract monsters.

I don't have anything against it, I just have to be a muso when I'm surrounded by monsters, but, well, that's it.

<blank>

Well, if the boar's blood is so neatly extracted, it might be useful for something, and I should put it away in storage. It won't rot if I put it in storage.

<blank>

<blank>

...... and I just remembered that with the blood, I should take some period skipping pills. The period-skipping ones.

I've already bought a year's worth and I'm pretty sure I'm ready to skip the first one. Gokun.

Dia-kun, look at this!　I've just completed a hot spring-style bath!"

Here's another magic circle of light wizards, and I've tried to make it possible to adjust the brightness infinitely in one magic circle!"

I was like, "Wow wow, you incorporated the stepless brightness adjustment into the light magic circle? ...... usually says it's divided into several magic circles, but you can do it in one? Ha, I didn't know it was possible to do this. ...... If you darken it properly, it saves magic power, heh!"

It's better to keep them separate for maintenance, but to save on magic stones, it's better to keep them together as much as possible."

<blank>

Our Mr. Deere is steadily on his way to becoming a magician. ......

No, it's a genre, alchemy, right?　Alchemy, that's a wide range.

<blank>

Next, I'm thinking of making one that detects ambient brightness and automatically adjusts to a certain brightness. The stepless adjustment is a preliminary step.

It could also be used to lift loads of different weights to a certain height.

'Yes, I think so!　I think this could be applied to Golem!"

<blank>

Dia-kun, smiling with a smile on her face. She looks like an engineering girl. I want to give her a wrench.

<blank>

How about your sister's bath?"

Yes, this one has a certain elegance to it, too. Come here.

<blank>

I head to the bath with Deere-kun.

There was an open-air bath. To be exact, one wall of the bath was a large window that allowed one to take a bath while enjoying the view of nature.

In addition to the bathtub, it has a drainage ditch, and overflowing water drips into the woods as appropriate. There's even a space to wash yourself.

<blank>

'Wow, it's nice and spacious. ...... where is this?"

It's just up the river near Solacidore. There's no way they can get in, so don't worry if the demons are right in front of you."

<blank>

In case you're wondering, it's not touchable or visible from the outside. It's a fixed-point camera.

Maybe we could switch to more different points around the world. It would be a great way to travel in search of spectacular scenery.

<blank>

"How about you come in with me?　I'll wash your back. But I don't have a sweatshirt."

Huh?　Uh, uh, I don't want to!　Oh, no, it's not that I don't want to!

<blank>

Dia-kun's face turns red and he refuses.

That's worth teasing!　I love that about you!
