# Let’s go, Terrarial Ruby

<b>

The movement from Akahagane to the Tesshin-Terrarial Ruby border can be carried out smoothly with the cooperation of the Five Elders.

Tampering with the passage records up to that point is also a piece of cake... no, it’s an official record. It’s not tampering.

<b>

“Ah, this is the healer's identification. If you say you’re going to make a mysterious magical tool, it’s convenient to be accepted as a dwarf, so I made it one of my sons.”

“...The power of authority is amazing.”

“This much is a piece of cake.”

<b>

The healer has become the son of Queen Mi-chan!

There’s no claim to succession, but he’s a healer prince! Also, the unknown father is unnecessary since it’s a dwarf saga, and it’s fine to say it’s the father’s blood even if he’s not dwarf-sized.

<b>

Wow, I thought power was troublesome, but it’s so reliable when it’s on your side.

It’s an official dwarf identification created through official procedures!

<b>

<b>

Moreover, that’s not all.

The magical vehicle jointly developed by me and Dia-kun. The Five Elders, Mi-chan and the others, have gotten their hands on this.

<b>

“Wow, Kari-chan! If we can improve fuel efficiency, we won’t need horses anymore!”

“It’s definitely more efficient than horse golems at this point by directly using carts.”

“Should we make the frame out of bones and cover it with leather to lighten it? It’ll also help with shock absorption when it collides.”

“For protecting the passengers, can’t we transfer it to a substitute doll?”

“I’m not a magical tool specialist, but I’ll handle the ink for the circuits... Huh? Kari-chan, what is this perfect ink... I’m losing confidence...”

<b>

With all that, a properly functioning magical vehicle has been completed.

The fuel efficiency is still poor, though.

<b>

<b>

“Awesome, Dia-kun. Our magical vehicle has a dramatic before and after.”

“The ride quality is completely different. Well, it’s quieter when my sister drives it.”

<b>

When I drive it, I lift it 3mm off the ground.

<b>

<b>

Furthermore, that’s not all.

<b>

“Sister! Look at this!”

“Oh? What’s that stylish boots and armor?”

“The Five Elders made it for me!”

<b>

Arthur has received new equipment. The work of the Five Elders’ workshop, dragon boots and armor. (Price: 5 dragon scales)

They had made something that was not usable casually outside during Dia-kun’s time, but this one seems to only have a functionality that changes size to match Arthur’s size based on that reflection.

<b>

But at least with this, there’s no worry of being mistaken for a wild dragon.

<b>

“...Ignoring the laws of physics, as expected of the Five Elders’ workshop?”

“By the way, this armor transforms into a saddle! Sister, you can become a dragon rider!”

“Oh wow.”

<b>

Becoming a dragon rider is somewhat enticing.

You can ride without a saddle, but having one looks better.

<b>

“By the way, it’s not just me, but Aisia can ride it too, right?”

“Leaving aside Dia-kun, Aisia-san’s skills... Ah, yes, she can ride...”

“Yay, Aisia! Aisia can also become a dragon rider!”

<b>

...Huh? Aisia is supposed to be the one singing about it, and becoming the one being sung about is a bit awkward? I see.

<b>

<b>

Well, with that, the vehicles have become more abundant, including Arthur-kun.

<b>

With identification and means of transportation in place, there’s nothing to hinder our movement!

Let’s go, Terrarial Ruby!!

<b>

...Well, it’s not like we were originally hindered by anyone.
