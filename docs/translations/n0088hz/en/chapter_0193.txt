# When push comes to shove, terra real b

As for the transfer from Akahagane to the Tessin Terra Realby border, it can be done smoothly with the cooperation of the Five Elders.

You can falsify the traffic records to get there. ...... No, it's an official record. That's not tampering.

<blank>

"Oh, this is a healer's ID card," he said. If you are going to make magical tools, it's convenient to convince people that you are a dwarf, so I made you one of our sons.

The power of ...... power is awesome."

I'm pretty good at this.

<blank>

Healer, I'm now the son of Queen Mee!

He is a healer prince, though he has no inheritance rights!　Furthermore, the father unknown is unnecessary because it is a dwarf saga, and even if he is not dwarf-sized, it is no problem to say that it is probably his father's blood.

<blank>

Oh man, I thought power was nasty, but it's so much more reliable when it's on your side.

It is an official dwarven identity card made through an official procedure!

<blank>

<blank>

And that's not all.

This is a car magic tool that Dia and I jointly developed. This is the one that Mee and the other Five Elders got their hands on.

<blank>

Kari said, "That's great, Kari!　If we can improve the fuel consumption problem, we won't need horses anymore!

"I'm pretty sure the carts are far more efficient than the horse golem directly ...... at this point."

"Would you save weight with a bone frame and leather exterior?　It would also reduce the impact of a collision."

If you're going to protect the passenger, can't you just kind of transfer them to a surrogate doll?"

I'm not a magic tool specialist, but I can mix ink for circuits. ...... What?　Kari, what is this perfect ink ...... that makes me lose confidence ......"

<blank>

And so, a grueling, properly working grimoire car was completed.

Fuel economy is still poor though.

<blank>

<blank>

It's amazing, Dia," he said. The magic car we made has a dramatic before-and-after look.

The ride is totally different. Well, it's much quieter when your sister moves it."

<blank>

When I move it, I float it 3mm.

<blank>

<blank>

And what's more, that wasn't all.

<blank>

Miss.... Look at this!

"Oh?　What's with the stylish boots and armor?

The Five Elders made it for me!

<blank>

New equipment has been added to Arthur. It's a pair of dragon boots and armor, the work of the Five Great Old Craftsmen. (Price: 5 dragon scales)

They had made something at a level that could not be used casually outside at the time of Dear-kun, but this one seems to have only enough functionality to change size according to Arthur's size change based on that reflection.

<blank>

But at least now you don't have to worry about being mistaken for a stray dragon.

<blank>

...... Is that as expected of the Five Elder Workshop when it ignores the laws of physics?"

By the way, this armor transforms into a saddle!　Miss, you can become a dragon rider!

Oh!"

<blank>

I'm a little fascinated by dragon riders and such.

You can ride without a saddle, but it looks better with one.

<blank>

By the way, if not me, you'll give Aysia and the others a ride, won't you?"

I'm not sure if you're a good person or not, but I'm sure you're a good person. ......

I did it, Isiah! Isiah can be a dragonrider too!"

<blank>

...... What?　You're saying that Isiah is the one who makes it into a song, and that it's a little delicate for you to be the one being sung to?　I see.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, that's how the ride was enhanced, including Mr. Arthur.

<blank>

With our identities and means of transportation in place, there's nothing holding us back anymore!

Let's go, Terra Realvy!

<blank>

...... Well, it wasn't that anyone prevented me from doing it in the first place.

<blank>
