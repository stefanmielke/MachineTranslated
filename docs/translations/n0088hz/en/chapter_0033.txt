# Merchant Guild of the Port Town Veraldo

(Oh, by the way, my cousin had a baby. Congratulations!

...She’s younger than me. Ah, I want to get married too...)

<b>

I, Karina, have a pretty close relationship with the aunties through nudity. There were a few younger girls too, but they kept their distance.

Why is that? Did they see through my ulterior motives? Shiver, I’m not a bad girl.

Is it that I can’t get close to girls without the help of alcohol...?

Well, I’m not saying the aunties aren’t girls. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

So, here I am, all cleaned up from the bath, arriving at the Merchant Guild!

<b>

The aunties were saying things like, “Hey, make sure to wash this part well!” “Don’t forget behind your ears,” and “What, you don’t have a tail? I thought you were a beastman in that time of the month,” while I thoroughly washed my whole body, so I don’t have to worry about body odor anymore.

At least for today and tomorrow.

<b>

“Alright, I wonder if there’s a place to buy alcohol, and I need to stock up on lotion.”

<b>

According to Sati, if I ask at the Merchant Guild, they’ll tell me where I can buy alcohol.

In Veraldo, I should be able to make a bit of profit (including expenses), and I should be able to buy enough lotion. I wonder how much I can buy.

<b>

With that excited feeling, I stepped into the Merchant Guild, only to find pirates inside.

Hmm?

<b>

“Is this the Merchant Guild...?”

“Indeed it is.”

<b>

No way!? There are crew members with bandanas, and a gruff old man wearing a captain’s hat with a skull mark and an eye patch—clearly pirates! This looks like a pirate hideout!

Or maybe it’s a tavern that was taken over by pirates!?

<b>

“Ah... Miss, is this your first time in Veraldo?”

<b>

As I stood there dumbfounded, a man who seemed to be a staff member approached me.

<b>

“Ah, yes. It’s my first time.”

“Then you must be thinking, ‘This is just like a pirate hideout.’”

“Well, yes.”

“You’re mostly correct. Pirates are a kind of maritime merchant.”

<b>

Pirates—privateers. Those who make a living by plundering cargo from ships without trade permits. Apparently, they are “public servants” with the country’s permission.

<b>

I see... So I can’t just go around attacking pirates and stealing their treasure.

<b>

“They just finished a job, so it’s best not to get too close. Now, what do you need?”

“Ah, yes. Please tell me where I can buy alcohol and where I can stock up on lotion.”

“So you don’t have an alcohol license, understood. Is the lotion powdered? The alcohol wholesaler is—”

<b>

“Hey! Alcohol, huh? I’ll buy it for you! I was just wanting some alcohol!”

<b>

A pirate interrupted my conversation with the staff member. He looks like a captain with a fancy hat and an eye patch.

People in this world often get involved in conversations, but why? Oh, is it because I’m beautiful?

<b>

“Staff member, does this guy have an alcohol license?”

“...He doesn’t have one. You can do personal transactions for up to three bottles.”

“Then just three bottles, I guess. The payment is—”

“Here you go!”

<b>

Saying that, he tossed three copper coins with a clink.

Three copper coins scattered on the floor.

<b>

Huh?

<b>

“Pick it up quickly. Ah, I could buy you for a night, you know.”

“Staff member, that guy dropped money. Or is he here to pick a fight?”

“W-Wait, Gomez! Guild members fighting is forbidden!”

“Isn’t it fine? I heard something about lotion too, right? You’re going to use it, so I’ll take care of you.”

<b>

Saying that, he tried to put his alcohol-smelling arm around me, so I swiftly dodged.

I just got cleaned up at the bathhouse, don’t touch me with those dirty hands!

<b>

What a difference from Blade-senpai—wait, thinking back, Blade-senpai was like this too, wasn’t he? Hmm, I wonder if this Gomez is actually a good guy...

<b>

“Ha, if you want to buy me, bring 100 gold coins, drunkard.”

“100 coins, huh? Well, if you become my woman, I might consider it.”

<b>

Gomez the pirate replied to my comeback that sent Blade-senpai packing.

Seriously? Can pirates make that much money?

<b>

“Well, that’s a no. You seem really cheap.”

“What? Where am I cheap?”

“Are you stupid? Those three copper coins are proof of being a cheapskate. No girl would fall for a guy like that.”

<b>

Plus, it’s not “I’ll give it to you,” but “I might consider it.” He’s not going to give it after all.

<b>

“W-Who are you calling cheap!?”

“Oh? Is a man who gets angry over something like this really that small-minded? Where, where? I can’t see someone so small! Is there someone smaller than my pinky?”

“—!!!!”

<b>

Oh dear, Gomez’s face is turning bright red, isn’t it?

Are you that excited by my little pinky gesture?

<b>

“W-Wait, what are you provoking him for?”

“Eh? Oh no, staff member. Getting angry over this means you’re admitting you’re small-minded, right? A big-minded person wouldn’t care at all. Huh? You’re not saying there’s someone small-minded here, are you?”

“...N-No, that’s not—!?”

“Phew, phew...!”

<b>

Sorry, staff member. I dragged you into this.

Gomez is trying his best to calm his breathing.

If he gets angry now, it’ll just confirm he’s a small fry. Hehe.
