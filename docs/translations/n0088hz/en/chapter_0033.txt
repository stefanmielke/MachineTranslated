# Merchant Guild of the Port Town of Velarde

(Oh, by the way, my itco had a baby. Congratulations!

(...... I guess he's younger than me. Oh, I wish I was married too. ......)

I, Karina, was a naked girl, and most of the old ladies were my friends. There were a few young girls here and there, but they were all distant.

Why?　Did you think I had ulterior motives?　Purrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, I'm not a bad girl.

You can't get along with a girl without the help of alcohol? ......

No, I'm not saying the ladies aren't girls. Yeah, I'm not saying they're not girls.

<blank>

<blank>

And so. I came to the merchants' guild, completely cleaned up after my bath!

<blank>

I've had old ladies tell me, "Hey, you have to wash this area thoroughly! You tend to forget behind the ears," "What, you don't have a tail? I thought you were an animal in a certain period of its life." I washed my body thoroughly, so there was no need to worry about body odor anymore.

At least for today and tomorrow.

<blank>

Now, I need to find a place to buy alcohol and stock up on lotions.

<blank>

Satitan says that if you ask the merchant guild, they will tell you about stores that sell alcohol.

He said Velarde would make a small profit (including expenses) and would be able to buy enough lotion. I wonder how much I can buy.

<blank>

With such excitement, I stepped into the merchant guild and found a pirate inside.

Hmm?

<blank>

Hey, is this the merchants guild ......?"

Yes, but..."

<blank>

No way!　The sailors with bandanas around their necks, and the man with a heavy eye patch wearing a captain's hat with a skull mark on it, they are all pirates!　It's a pirate hideout, no matter how you look at it!

Or it's a bar after it's been overrun by pirates!

<blank>

'Ah ...... miss, is this your first time in Velarde?'

<blank>

As I was stunned, a man who seemed to be a staff member spoke to me.

<blank>

Oh, yes. It's my first time."

"Then you must be thinking right now, 'This looks like a pirate hideout.

Yeah, well.

That's about right. Pirates are a kind of merchant of the sea."

<blank>

Pirates - privateers. Those who make their living by taking cargo from ships that do not have a trading license. They are apparently "public servants" who have permission from the government.

<blank>

I see. ...... So I shouldn't be able to attack pirates and take their treasure without their permission?

<blank>

They've just finished their work. They're in a state of excitement, so you'd better stay away from them. So what can I do for you?"

'Uh, yes. Tell me where I can sell liquor and where I can stock up on lotions."

I understand that you don't have a liquor license. Lotion is a powder?　The liquor wholesaler--"

<blank>

Oh!　Sake!　I'll buy it for you!　I just needed some booze."

<blank>

A pirate interrupts me and the staff member's conversation. He is wearing a captain-like hat and an eye patch.

People in this world often get involved with me, what's with that?　Is it because I'm beautiful?

<blank>

"Officials, does this person have a liquor license?"

You don't have ......, although up to three bottles would be a good place to start as a private transaction."

Then I guess I'll just have three bottles. The price is--"

Here we go!

<blank>

He says so and throws three copper coins with a churning sound.

Three copper coins scattered on the floor.

<blank>

An?

<blank>

'Pick it up quick. Yeah, I could buy you a night."

I said, "Mr. Official, that man dropped his money. Or was he trying to pick a fight?"

Mr. Gomez!　It's against the law for guild members to tangle with each other!

I heard the lotion and everything. I could hear the lotion and stuff, you know?　You use it, I'll deal with it."

<blank>

He then tried to hug my shoulder with a breath that reeked of alcohol, and I shrugged it off.

Don't touch me with your dirty hands after I've cleaned you up at the bathhouse, okay?

<blank>

Totally different from Blade-senpai - or, come to think of it, was Blade-senpai like this, too?　Hmmm, I wonder if this Gomez is a nice guy too: ......

<blank>

'Hmph, if you want to buy me, you'll have to bring me a hundred gold coins, drunk.

A hundred?　Well, if you're going to be my girl, I might consider it."

<blank>

The pirate Gomez replies to my decisive line after fighting off Blade-senpai.

Seriously? Pirates make that much money?

<blank>

No, well, no. He seems very stingy."

What?　What's so petty about me?"

Are you even smart?"　Three coppers there proves that you are a cheapskate. No woman would fall for a little guy like that.

<blank>

And it's not "I'll do it," it's "I'll think about it. After all, you're the one who won't give it to me.

<blank>

Who's little?

Oh?"　I wonder if there is a man with a small vessel who gets angry at this level?　Where is he?　Who's too small to see?　Who's smaller than your pinky finger?

"ーーー！！！！"

<blank>

Oh my goodness, Mr. Gomez, your face is so red.

Did you get so turned on by my pinky finger bending gesture?

<blank>

"Hey, what are you trying to stir things up!"

Eh?"　I don't like it, staff. If you get angry at this, it means you admit you have a small capacity, right?　If you are a person of large capacity, this has nothing to do with you at all. Hmm?　Don't tell me, Mr. Staff, that there are people with such small capacity here?

"............ No, I mean!

Whoosh, whoosh ......!"

<blank>

I'm sorry, staff. I didn't mean to drag you into this.

Gomez breathing as best he can.

If I get angry here, I will admit that I am a small person. Hmmm...
