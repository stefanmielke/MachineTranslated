# F Rank Promotion!

<b>

<b>

I, Karina, am currently delivering the slime cores I collected with my senior at the guild.

I managed to get a beautiful slime core using magic, so I'm looking forward to the appraisal!

<b>

<b>

As a result, since the undamaged slime core was bought at a high price, my share became 8 large copper coins for 5 cores.

Now, let's go ahead and pay the registration fee for the adventurer's guild.

<b>

"Blade didn't give you the one he collected, did he?"

"Ah, no. It was really amazing. Wizards are incredible, you know? It was like whoosh!"

"I see. Then there's no problem."

<b>

Blade testified that I could hunt undamaged slime cores by myself.

Thank you, senior. My vocabulary is a bit lacking, though.

<b>

"Here you go, Karina. This is your adventurer's guild certificate. You are now F rank."

<b>

I finally got the adventurer's guild certificate!

If I remember correctly, F rank is for apprentices. Still, it's a proper identification!

Now I won't have to rely on the god's hypnotic identification anymore...!

<b>

"Well then, I'm going to pay my sister. See you later."

"Thanks for everything! I'll be counting on you again!"

"Haha, then next time, you treat me to a drink."

<b>

I bowed my head slightly to the stylishly departing senior, Blade.

Wow, I really owe him a lot. He even taught me woodworking skills.

Especially my encounter with Sister Harumikazuchi.

Next time, I will definitely go see her with the money I earned! And hopefully, spend the night!

<b>

"Blade is just a nice guy when he's not drunk, right...?"

"Well, he was a pretty nice guy even when he was somewhat drunk."

"I heard you were taken to Shunrai-tei. Were you okay?"

<b>

If we're talking about whether I was okay, I lost my chastity, so I wasn't safe.

But think of it this way. I have nothing left to lose...!

<b>

"To put it mildly, that was the best encounter I've ever had."

"…Karina, could it be that you are into women too?"

"Actually, I might only be into women (since I'm a guy on the inside)."

"I-I see."

<b>

The receptionist seemed a bit taken aback.

Don't worry, I won't do anything without consent!

<b>

<b>

"Oh, by the way, I want to accept a request right away."

"Yes, are you looking to collect more slime cores?"

"There’s a request for chopping logs, right? I’d like to do that."

"…It’s a tough physical job, you know? There’s a risk of being attacked by monsters. I can't recommend it since guild members can't accompany you..."

<b>

<b>

【Request】Log Collection. Reward: 1 silver coin per log

<b>

<b>

Normally, this is a request that requires multiple people, either going as a team or having guild staff accompany you with a magical bag (an expensive one that can hold logs).

You need to be vigilant while chopping wood, and if monsters appear, you have to defeat them. Moreover, if you spill blood, other monsters will be attracted, increasing the danger...

<b>

The reward you earn is split among the group, so the amount per person becomes small.

To be honest, this is a request that you can't handle unless you're part of a specialized group called "lumberjacks."

<b>

<b>

"That said, I can't recommend it at all..."

"Well, I'll be using magic too. If I'm attacked, I'll just take care of the monsters while I'm at it."

"Hmm, magic, huh... Well, I did stop doing it once. It's at your own risk, okay?"

<b>

The receptionist emphasized this. It’s a job that’s definitely tough for a newbie to do solo.

That's why, if I can do it solo, it's a delicious opportunity.

If I deliver 25 logs, it will cover the registration fee for the merchant guild.

<b>

<b>

…Well, if you think about it normally, delivering slime cores is definitely easier. No doubt about it. It's also easier to carry.

However, unlike slime cores, logs generally have demand and don't depreciate in value. It seems there’s a limit to how many undamaged slime cores can be bought in a day. They can't process them all.

<b>

I wouldn't even think about doing it without spatial magic.

<b>

<b>

"I'll accept it for now, but if you think it's impossible, please come back immediately."

"Okay! Thank you!"

<b>

Thus, I successfully accepted the request for log collection.
