# F rank promotion!

<blank>

<blank>

I'm Karina, and I'm delivering the slime nucleus that I caught with my seniors at the guild.

I used magic and got a beautiful slime nucleus, so I'm looking forward to the assessment!

<blank>

<blank>

So, the intact slime nucleus was bought at a higher price, so my share of five pieces came to eight large copper coins.

Let's say you pay the registration fee for the Adventurers' Guild as it is.

<blank>

You didn't give Mr. Braid what he took to Ms. Karina, did you?"

Yeah. It was really amazing. I was like, "Wow, wizards are awesome.

I see. Then that's no problem."

<blank>

Braid also testified that I can hunt an intact slime nucleus on my own.

Thank you, senpai. I don't have much vocabulary.

<blank>

Here is Karina's Adventurer's Guild certificate, rank F."

<blank>

I've got my Adventurer's Guild certificate!

The F rank is an apprenticeship, if I remember correctly. Still, it is a proper identification!

Now you won't have to use God's hypnotic ID anymore. ......

<blank>

I'll pay your sister. See you later."

Thank you for everything you have done for me!　I'm looking forward to working with you again!"

Ha-ha-ha, then you'll have to buy me a drink this time."

<blank>

I bowed my head to Braid senior, who left in style.

Well, you've been a real help. You taught me some woodworking skills.

Especially meeting with Sister Harumikazuchi.

Definitely, I'm going to see him this time with my hard-earned money!　And then, if I dare, for one night!

<blank>

Mr. Blade is just a nice guy if he's not drunk. ......

Well, he was a good drunk there, wasn't he?"

I heard you were taken to the Shun Lai Pavilion. Are you all right?"

<blank>

If you ask me if I was okay, I wasn't okay because I lost my chastity.

Think of it the other way around. Rather, think ...... that you have nothing left to lose!

<blank>

To put it mildly, that's where I met the best."

...... Carina, maybe you're one of those guys who can handle women?"

'If anything, it might only be women (since they're men inside).'

I see.

<blank>

The receptionist was a little taken back.

Don't worry, we won't do it without agreement!

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, by the way, I'd like to take your request right away. Speaking of which, I'd like to take your request right away."

"Yes, add a slime nuke?"

I was thinking, "You know those requests for logs to be cut?　That's what I wanted to do."

You know, "...... it's hard, strenuous work, you know?　There is also the danger of being attacked by demons. You can't be accompanied by guild members, and I don't recommend it. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Request] Log collection.　Reward: 1 silver coin per log.

<blank>

<blank>

Usually, this is a request that can be done by more than one person, either by going as a team or by having a guild official accompany you with a magic bag (an expensive one with the level of a log in it).

While cutting down trees, you need to be vigilant of your surroundings and if a demon appears, you need to defeat it. Besides, if you spread blood around, other demons will come to you and the danger level will jump. ......

<blank>

The remuneration earned in this way is also lower per person because it is divided by the number of people.

Frankly speaking, this is a request that would not be possible without a specialized group of people called "lumberjacks.

<blank>

<blank>

So I can't recommend it enough.

I use magic there, too. If I get attacked, I'll go and get the part of the body that proves that I killed the attacker.

"Ummm, is it magic ...... well I stopped it once, right?　At your own risk, right?"

<blank>

The receptionist who reminds me. A tough job for a newcomer to do solo by any stretch of the imagination.

That said, if you can do it solo, it's a delicious story.

If you deliver 25 bottles, you will reach the registration fee of the merchant guild.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Well, it's usually easier to deliver a slime nuke. Definitely. It's also easier to carry.

But unlike slime nuclei, logs are basically in demand and don't fall in price. They have a fixed number of intact slime nuclei that can be bought in a day. Because they can't handle it.

<blank>

I wouldn't even think of doing it without spatial magic.

<blank>

<blank>

I'll accept your offer, but if you feel you can't make it, please come home right away.

Yes. Thank you."

<blank>

Thus, he succeeded in getting a request for log collection.
