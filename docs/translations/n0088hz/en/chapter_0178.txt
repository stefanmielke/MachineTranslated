# I. I'm a beauty that could topple a nation.

<b>

And the next day.

<b>

Setting aside the stolen fake "Castle Breaking Hammer"...

I began negotiations with Mii-chan to see if I could somehow acquire the "Castle Breaking Hammer" by explaining my situation.

<b>

It's not a rushed journey, and since we're placing a door that connects to our base, there's no problem taking our time with the negotiations.

<b>

Having cleared the area of others, we gathered in the reception room, with Dear-kun occasionally adding supplementary information as I explained to Mii-chan.

Mii-chan listened seriously. Her cute face looked sharp, and she was still adorable.

<b>

And I finished explaining everything.

<b>

"…So, that's the situation, Mii-chan. …Is it no good?"

"That's fine! I'll return it. I won't use it anyway."

<b>

What a surprise. The negotiations, which were expected to be difficult, ended in an instant.

<b>

"That was easy! Wait, is that really okay, Mii-chan!?"

"Yeah. I understand the situation, and it's a request from Kari-chan. Besides, we're dwarves, right? It makes more sense for us to keep the things we made ourselves; it's more symbolic of dwarves!"

<b>

What a surprise. The negotiations, which were expected to be difficult, ended in an instant. (It's important, so I'll say it again)

<b>

"Um, don't you need to consult with the higher-ups or the king?"

"Huh? Didn't I mention it? We're the kings here. The queen!"

"Seriously, Mii-chan? Wait, do you wear bondage?"

"Not that kind of queen! I could wear it, though?"

<b>

Speaking of which, she did say she governed this town. And this town was the capital.

<b>

"Mii-chan is royalty?"

"Oh, it's not like that. The king of Tesshin is determined by who is the best at making things. We're all craftsmen!"

<b>

And the top five are called the Five Elders. No way, that's some serious authority.

The important matters of the country are decided by the consensus of the five, but if it's a request from me, no one would refuse (I can say that for sure).

<b>

…Oh no, I was undermining the country. I'm a beauty that could topple a nation.

Does that mean that all the holders of the throne in other countries are my wives?

Hey! Someone tell me!!

<b>

No wonder Ms. Mashiro, an A-rank, can't easily take on high-cost orders...

<b>

<b>

What? All five elders are women, and men can't become kings?

It seems there were men who became kings in the past due to their overwhelming skills, but they said, "Men can't have children. That's a disadvantage."

<b>

"The workshop is better than the materials, right?"

"Oh, seeds are treated as materials. I see."

<b>

And just as the quality of the works born in the workshop raises the workshop's reputation, the skills of the children are partially reflected in the parents' evaluations.

…Seeds are generally uncertain, so mainly the mother. And if it's at the village level, then the village chief.

<b>

"Huh? So does that mean Mii-chan has kids!? I just became a dad!"

"Hehe, I have lots of grandchildren, you know? …Are you going to dislike us?"

"I won't! If anything, it makes you even more charming!"

<b>

I hugged Mii-chan, who was about to tear up. 

Her small body fit perfectly in my arms. …Oh no, this loli mother is getting me excited.

<b>

"Hehe, I can tell you're saying that from the bottom of your heart, so I like you, Kari-chan."

"I love you and Mii-chan too!"

<b>

I really get along well with dwarves. But only the girls.

<b>

"…Ahem."

"Oh, we got sidetracked. So about the 'Castle Breaking Hammer'..."

<b>

With Dear-kun's cough, we returned to the main topic.

<b>

"It was originally called the 'Castle Breaking Hammer,' so it's fine to say that the fake is a replica of the divine artifact with that name, right? We can't perfectly replicate its performance, though."

"Is that okay?"

"Of course, it's fine. So, shall we hold a ceremony for the return of the divine artifact, Kari-chan?"

<b>

Mii-chan beamed with a sun-like smile.
