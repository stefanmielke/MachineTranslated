# Me. You're a leaning beauty.

<blank>

And the next day.

<blank>

Aside from the stolen fake "Breaking Wall Hammer" ......

I told Mee about my situation, and negotiations began to see if I could somehow acquire the "Breaking Wall Hammer".

<blank>

It's not a rushed trip, and if you want, you're putting a door that leads to a base, so there's nothing wrong with negotiating patiently over a long period of time.

<blank>

Since we were paid by others, we gathered in the reception room alone and explained the situation to Mee-chan, with Dia-kun adding a little something extra.

Mee-chan took it seriously. Her cute face was crisp and she was still cute.

<blank>

Then I finished explaining the whole thing.

<blank>

"...... and that's why, mee-chan. I wonder if ...... is no good?"

"Okay, I'll give it back. I won't use it anyway."

<blank>

What a surprise. Negotiations that were expected to be difficult ended in an instant.

<blank>

Light!　Eh, that's okay, Mee-chan!"

I'm sure you'll be able to help me out. I know what's going on, and Kari is asking us to do this. And we are dwarves, you know?　It would be more like a symbol of dwarves if we put something we made ourselves, wouldn't it?

<blank>

What a surprise. The negotiations, which were expected to be difficult, were over in an instant. (This is the second time because it is important.)

<blank>

'Um, don't you need to talk to your superiors or the king or something?'

What was that?　Didn't I tell you?　I'm the king here. My queen!"

I said, "Seriously, Mee-chan. What, wear a bondage?"

I'm not your queen!　I don't mind if I wear it, though, do you?"

<blank>

Well, you said you were ruling this town. And this town was the capital.

<blank>

'Mee-chan was royalty?'

Oh, it's not like that," he said. The king of Tessin is the one who is the best at making things. We are all craftsmen!

<blank>

And the top five are called the Five Elders. Seriously, they are heavyweights.

He said that national matters are decided by a council of five people, but no one would refuse my request (I assured him).

<blank>

...... Oh my God, I've been a country wrecker. I'm a beautiful woman of the country.

In other countries, does that mean that all the heirs to this throne are my wives?

Hey, hey, hey!　Someone tell me what's going on!

<blank>

That's why it's a very expensive order that Mr. Masilo, an A-rated guy, can't just ask for it. ......

<blank>

<blank>

What, all the Five Elders are women, but men can't be kings?

In the past, there was a man who became king because of his overwhelming skill, but he said, "Men can't have children. That's why they are at a disadvantage.

<blank>

If it's materials and workshop, workshop is better.

Oh, seeds are treated as materials. I see."

<blank>

And just as the reputation of the workshop rises when the work produced at the workshop is good, the skill of the children is partly returned to the parents' reputation.

The ...... species is largely uncertain, so mainly to the mother. The rest is to the head of the village if it is a village unit.

<blank>

Hmm?"　Then that means you have a child, Mee!　I'd be a daddy!"

I've got lots of grandchildren. ...... are you going to hate us?"

I don't think so!　If anything, it's more attractive!"

<blank>

I hugged Mee-chan, who was on the verge of tears.

Her tiny body fits snugly in my arms. I'm getting excited. ...... Oh man, this loli transvestite.

<blank>

I love Kari-chan because I can tell that she really means it.

I love you too!

<blank>

I'm very good with dwarves. But only for girls.

<blank>

"......Kohonkkk."

I digress. So, about the "Breaking Wall Hammer"..."

<blank>

Deere's coughing brings me back to the main point of the conversation.

<blank>

The original was called a 'wall-breaking hammer,' and the imitation is a replica of a sacred artifact under that official name," he said.　It's not a perfect reproduction of its performance, though."

Are you sure?　So."

It's okay, it's okay. So, let's have a divine return ceremony, Kari-chan!"

<blank>

Mee-chan smiled like the sun.

<blank>
