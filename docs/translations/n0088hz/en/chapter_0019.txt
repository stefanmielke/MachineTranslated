# I Became a Merchant! ●Illustrations Included

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. When I woke up in the storage space and stepped outside, there was no footing.

I almost fell to my death! What a surprise!

<b>

Now that I think about it, what happened yesterday was probably flirting at best, maybe a mugging, or at worst, kidnapping.

Since coming to this world, I’ve only met decent people, so I completely forgot about such things. It’s not that I couldn’t make that judgment; I just wasn’t sober enough. I really need to be careful with alcohol.

<b>

“By the way, it’s not normal for a girl to go into an alley alone at night.”

<b>

Maybe the previous Japan, where women could walk out alone at night saying, “I’m just going to the convenience store,” had too good of a security situation. I was a man back then, though.

<b>

<b>

“Ah, it’s already noon. Did I sleep too much...?”

<b>

While floating in the air, I stretched. Since the temperature and humidity in the storage space are adjustable, it’s hard to keep track of time. I wonder if I should ask the god about it when I deliver the socks.

<b>

That said, I have plenty of money, so there’s no need to worry about time. No one is going to complain if I sleep too much.

This means I can live a carefree slow life, right? Sounds good. This is what you call a cheat life in another world.

<b>

“All right, then I’ll head to the Merchant Guild now!”

<b>

I can decide my plans on a whim like this.

How free this is. Wonderful.

I teleported from the sky to a deserted alleyway and headed toward the Merchant Guild.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Here’s my identification from the Adventurers’ Guild.”

“I’ll take it. ……… Confirmation complete. Is it okay to withdraw 25 silver coins from your affiliated account?”

“Yes!”

<b>

Thus, I joined the Merchant Guild. From today, I’m a merchant too!

Now I can proudly call myself Karina Shonin! Yay!

<b>

“How would you like to register your merchandise?”

“Uh? Well, I guess anything that’s requested? I want to do it while traveling and peddling.”

“Ah, I see. You want to be a peddler while adventuring. Then let’s register you for general goods. Please be aware that some items are regulated.”

“Regulated?”

<b>

After the explanation, it seemed there were items that couldn’t be handled, such as weapons, salt, and other strategic materials, slaves, rare creatures, and dangerous creatures.

It seems I need to accumulate contributions to the guild separately, take courses, and obtain a license.

<b>

So, slaves are also considered merchandise, huh. Interesting.

<b>

<b>

“Well, for weapons, salt, and alcohol, if it’s a small quantity, I think we can overlook it. However, if it exceeds personal transaction levels, you may face fines and penalties, so please be careful.”

<b>

If I were to ask a party of acquaintances for a full set of equipment, I might be overlooked, but if I were to sell it on a large scale, I’d get caught. That makes sense.

<b>

It seems that handling toxic substances with a certain level of potency would also lead to penalties.

If I unknowingly handle items that require permission or are prohibited, it could lead to arrest, so if I acquire unfamiliar or suspicious products, I should check with the Merchant Guild.

I might have them confiscated, but that’s better than being punished for an unknowing transaction.

<b>

“I recommend keeping your range broad but shallow.”

“Yes, thank you! By the way, do you have any recommended items or places for peddling?”

“Why not exchange information in that lounge over there? Peddlers gather there.”

<b>

The receptionist pointed to a lounge. It had a bar.

While the Adventurers’ Guild seemed like a lively dining place, this one gave off an impression of a stylish bar.

It seems there are occasionally merchants who own shops, but mostly it’s peddlers.

I see, it’s nice that the Merchant Guild has a place for me to talk to senior merchants.

<b>

<b>

As I headed toward the lounge, quiet gazes gathered around me. Mainly on my chest.

You guys, I know you’re staring.

<b>

<b>

“Hey, I heard you’re a peddler? I have some recommendations if you want to hear them?”

<b>

Whoa, a flashy guy!

Compared to the adventurer, especially Blade-senpai, this guy looked clearly scrawny, and he was glancing at my breasts while talking to me with a glass in hand.

They have glass cups here too. In the guild, they used wooden cups.

<b>

…All right, let’s play the cute girl card and try to extract some information!

<b>

“Um, what’s your recommendation? Please tell me, Se-n-pa-i?”

<b>

And I leaned forward and looked up! Emphasizing my cleavage! Piercing gazes!

Hehe, I’m quite the schemer with this pose! It’s giving me goosebumps!

<b>

“Oh… uh, the recommendation is magic stones. If you take them to the Alchemy Kingdom, they’ll buy them at a high price. If you bring back magical tools or potions from there, you’ll definitely make a profit.”

“Ah, I see.”

<b>

But that country has fallen, right?

The information is outdated. No, I wonder if this is normal in this world. I should check.

<b>

“Um, I heard rumors that the Alchemy Kingdom has fallen…”

“Hahaha, that’s just a rumor, right? A country doesn’t fall so easily. Especially the Alchemy Kingdom ruled by the God of Chaos!”

“Ah, right. I see.”

<b>

All right, it seems there’s nothing to gain from this guy! Time to change targets!

<b>

If only there were a female merchant around… Oh, I found a cute girl drinking at the counter!

At first glance, she looks younger. But the glass she’s holding is definitely alcohol!

In other words, a legal loli—she must be a dwarf! (Basic knowledge check)

<b>

I shook off the guy and headed toward the legal loli.

She had cute, curly red hair and bright green eyes.

Holding the glass with both hands, she was adorably sipping her drink. I wonder if it’s wine.

<b>

“Um, can I have a moment?”

“Hm? What is it? Don’t interrupt my drinking.”

<b>

She glared at me, but this is the moment to push through. I spoke up.

<b>

“I just became a merchant, so I wanted to introduce myself. Please let me treat you to a drink.”

“Oh! You have good taste! There are idiots who say kids shouldn’t drink alcohol. I’m a dwarf, you know?”

<b>

As soon as I offered to treat her, she became cheerful. As expected of a dwarf; they love their alcohol.

<b>

“I’d love to learn a lot from you, a senior female merchant.”

“Yeah, yeah. When you suddenly tried to use your looks on that guy earlier, I thought, ‘What’s up with this girl?’ but you’re a good person. It’s fine, I’ll teach you as much as you want for the drink.”

<b>

All right, I pulled out a gold coin and placed it on the counter.

Master, please get a drink for my senior.

<b>

“First, please tell me your name. I’m Karina.”

“Nice to meet you, Karina. I’m Sati. My real name is long, so just call me by my nickname.”

<b>

I shook hands with Sati. Oh, her hand is small. Warm and soft.

Is she really an adult? Just looking at her, she seems like a middle schooler. She’s so cute I want to call her Sati-tan.

<b>

“I’m a merchant who buys and sells alcohol from various regions, so if you want some, just let me know.”

“Wow, alcohol is indeed regulated, right?”

“Yeah, I worked really hard for it!”

<b>

A dwarf selling alcohol. Hmm, that fits!

<b>

“Well, Karina, you should drink too. I’ll treat you as well.”

“Ah, yes. But if I get drunk, I might get a little out of control…”

“What? You can’t drink my alcohol!?”

“I’ll gladly accept!”

<b>

Oh no, I messed up. This is going to make me lose my memory again.

Just as I thought that, Sati-tan was pouring alcohol for me.

An underage girl serving alcohol. Is this a reward?
