# I am a merchant!　illustrations

<blank>

<blank>

I'm Karina. I woke up this morning and went out of the storage space and there was no scaffolding.

I almost died from the fall!　What a surprise!

<blank>

I mean, if you think about it, yesterday was at best a pick-up, maybe a mugging, at worst a kidnapping or something.

I've met so many decent people since I came to this world that I had all of that stuff out of my head. I guess I was too drunk to make that kind of decision, or I was too drunk to remember. I really have to be careful with alcohol.

<blank>

I mean, a girl shouldn't normally go to a back alley alone in the middle of the night.

<blank>

Perhaps it was too safe in Japan in the past, when women could walk alone to a convenience store in the middle of the night. I was a man, though.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm not sure if I've slept too much or not. Did I sleep too much? ......"

<blank>

Floating in the air, I stretch out. I wonder if there is anything we can do about the fact that the temperature and humidity inside the storage space are so flexible that we lose track of time. I'll ask God when I deliver the socks.

<blank>

However, we have enough money and don't have to worry about time in detail. No one is going to complain if I sleep too much.

Isn't this what you call a freewheeling slow life?　It's great. This is what I call a cheat life in another world.

<blank>

Okay, so I guess I'm off to the Merchant's Guild now!"

<blank>

You can make plans in this way in a haphazard and carefree manner.

How freeing. It's wonderful.

I transitioned from the sky to an empty narrow street. I headed for the merchant guild.

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

I have an Adventurers' Guild ID card.

We will take care of it." We have received confirmation from ............. May I deduct 25 silver coins from the affiliated account?"

Yes!"

<blank>

Thus, I joined the Merchant Guild. Now I am a merchant from today!

Now I can call myself Karina Shonin!　Yay!

<blank>

How do you register the products you handle?"

Huh?"　Ah, I wonder. Anything you are asked to do at random?　I'd like to be a peddler as I travel.

Oh, yes. You are an adventurer and a peddler, right? Then, I'll take miscellaneous goods. Some items are restricted, so please be careful.

Regulations?

<blank>

The explanation was that there were certain items that could not be handled, such as armaments, salt and other strategic goods, slaves, rare and dangerous creatures, and other such items.

They would need to accumulate contributions to the guild separately, take a course and get a license.

<blank>

I mean, slaves are commodities too, hoho.

<blank>

<blank>

We can give you weapons, salt, liquor, etc. in small quantities, but be aware that there will be fines and penalties if you go beyond the level of a private transaction. However, please note that there are various fines and penalties that can be imposed on those who exceed the level of private transactions.

<blank>

If you are asked to make a set of equipment for a party of your acquaintance, you will be tolerated, but if you make a big sale, you will be caught. That's right.

<blank>

It is said that the handling of poisons, etc. is also punishable if the effect is strong to some extent.

If you unknowingly deal in such items that require permission or are forbidden, you may be arrested. If you purchase unfamiliar or suspicious-looking goods, please check with the Merchant Guild.

They might confiscate it, but it would be better than being punished for unknowingly trading it.

<blank>

I would recommend keeping it somewhat broad and shallow."

Yes, thank you very much!　And while I'm at it, do you have any recommendations for goods and places to peddle?"

Why don't you go to the lounge over there and exchange information? Vendors gather there.

<blank>

The receptionist at the merchant guild pointed to a lounge. With a bar.

While the Adventurers' Guild was more like a lively eatery, this one seemed more like a fashionable bar.

I heard that there are occasional shopkeepers here, but most of them are peddlers.

I see, I am grateful that the Merchants Guild provides a place where I can talk to senior merchants.

<blank>

<blank>

As I made my way to the lounge, my gaze was quickly and quietly drawn to it. Mainly on my chest.

You guys, they know.

<blank>

<blank>

"Hey, I heard you were peddling.　I have a recommendation.

<blank>

Oh, a man who looks like a charlatan!

The adventurer, a hulking man who was clearly a hulking man compared to the adventurer, especially Blade-senpai, spoke to me with a glass in his hand while glancing at my boobs.

I didn't know they had glass cups. At the guild, it was a wooden cup.

<blank>

...... Okay, let's dare to ask in a brash way here and draw out the information!

<blank>

What do you recommend?　Tell me, se-n-pay?"

<blank>

Then she bends forward & looks up!　Emphasis on the cleavage!　A piercing gaze!

I'm a bit of a fool myself, this pose!　It gives me goosebumps!

<blank>

You say, "Oh, ...... Oh, oh, that's a recommendation. What I recommend is a magic stone. If you take it to the alchemy kingdom, they will buy it at a high price. If you stock up on magical tools and potions there, you'll never lose money.

Ahai, soska."

<blank>

But that country was destroyed!

The information is old. No, I wonder if this is normal in this world. Let's check it out.

<blank>

Um, I heard a rumor that the Alchemy Kingdom has been destroyed.　I heard a rumor that the alchemy kingdom was destroyed.

"Ha ha ha, it's just a rumor, isn't it?　How can a country be destroyed so easily? Especially an alchemical kingdom ruled by the god of chaos?

"Uh-uh. Sodanee."

<blank>

Okay, it looks like we have nothing to gain from this guy!　Change target!

<blank>

Preferably with a female merchant. ...... Whoa, I found a cute girl drinking at the counter!

At first glance, she looks younger than her age. But the glass in his hand is definitely alcohol!

In other words, I saw it as legal lolita--Mr. Dwarf! (Basic knowledge check)

<blank>

I shake the guy off and head for the legal lolita.

She has curly, cute red hair and round green eyes.

She is holding a glass with both hands and drinking a lovely alcoholic beverage. I wonder what it is, maybe wine.

<blank>

Um, may I have a word?"

What?　What?　Don't interrupt my drinking.

<blank>

They stare at me, but this is the point where I have to stand my ground. I talk to him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm a new merchant, so I thought I'd say hello. Please let me buy you a drink.

Oh, you've got a good eye!　You have a good eye!　There are idiots who say that children shouldn't drink alcohol. I'm a dwarf, remember?"

<blank>

As soon as he says he will buy you a drink, he is in a good mood. Dwarves, after all, love to drink.

<blank>

As a senior female merchant, I would love to learn from you."

I thought he was a good guy. I thought he was a good guy when he made sexual advances on a guy earlier, but he's a good guy. I'll teach you how to drink.

<blank>

Good, I take out a single large copper coin and place it on the counter with a snap.

Master, I'll have a drink for my seniors with this.

<blank>

I'm Kalina," she said. My name is Karina."

Nice to meet you Karina. I'm Sati. My real name is too long, so you can call me by my nickname.

<blank>

Then he shakes hands with Sati. Oh, my hand is tiny. Warm and soft.

Is this really an adult?　If I had to say just how they look, I'd say they're in middle school. It's really cute. I want to call her Saty-tan.

<blank>

I'm a merchant who buys and sells alcohol from all over, so if you want some, just ask.

Heh, I thought alcohol was by permit only.

I did my best. I worked so hard!

<blank>

Dwarf liquor vendor. Hmmm, sounds like it!

<blank>

I'll buy you a drink, too. I'll buy you a drink too.

Oh, yes. Oh, no, but when I get drunk, I'm a bit of a jerk.

"What, you can't drink my booze?

Bon appétit!

<blank>

Oh, shoot. Another one of those memory jumpers.

When I thought that, Sati-tan was pouring me a drink.

Al harassment from a young girl. Is it a reward?
