# It's the One Who Misunderstands Who's at Fault, Meow

We easily smuggled ourselves into the Empire. The goal, the ogre tribe's village, is just ahead.

...Seriously, Arthur, that was fast. To cover a month on foot in a single leap.

"I'm a Thunder Dragon, you know!! I finally got to unleash my full power after a long time!!"

"You're pretty energetic for that, huh? You still feeling good?"

"Fufufufu, in terms of mobility, I won't lose to you, sis."

"Oh? I can get from here to Tesshin in one step, you know?"

"â€¦My bad, I concede!"

<b>

Well, if we have the mobility of a Thunder Dragon, we can safely say we arrived at the next town in about a day from the previous one. Much faster than a magic tool vehicle.

<b>

<b>

Now, since it wouldn't be ideal to land directly in the ogre tribe's village, which is scared of dragons, we quietly descend nearby and switch to walking.

We store the container. Arthur shrinks down and stays close to Dia-kun to protect him.

<b>

In exchange for adding Misha to our party, I sent Aishia back to the base. It wouldn't be right to take her to a dangerous place just because I can protect her, and it's a place we can return to anytime, anywhere.

She hesitated a bit about not being able to follow me, but I convinced her by creating a window from the base where she could peek at us. It's a technique I used before when tailing pirates. She can hear us too.

<b>

"Um, where's the half-dwarf...? He was still in the box, right?"

"That's right. Now, shall we go, Youki-chan?"

"Uh, well..."

"It's just a simple stay-at-home job, don't worry about it. Come on, shall we? You want me to deal with the dragon, right?"

"Y-yes... Priestess, attendants, please follow me."

<b>

So, following Youki-chan's lead, it's me, Dia-kun, and then Misha.

It's a formation completely focused on protecting the princess.

<b>

"Arthur, Misha, make sure to protect the princess properly!"

"Got it! Understood, sis!"

"Alright! Leave it to me! But if a dragon shows up, I'll leave it to you!"

<b>

Hey, hey, ho! We unite as one.

<b>

"Um, the princess... is more like an older sister, right? With the dwarf prince status and all... No, never mind."

"Meow? Was it Prince Karina?"

"It's a secret, okay? I had Mii-chan make a fake ID for me."

"Isn't that just plain illegal???"

<b>

How rude, it's a legal fake ID made through proper procedures by the dwarf queen. In this case, it's not the "ID" that's fake, but the "identity."

<b>

<b>

The ogre tribe's village is basically wooden, surrounded by a moat and wooden fences. It has a somewhat Japanese feel, reminiscent of a rural village from the Sengoku period.

<b>

"Priestess, I'll go ahead and explain to the village. Please wait a moment."

<b>

Since Youki-chan said that while looking at us, we waited at the edge of the village.

Of course, her gaze was directed at Dia-kun.

<b>

"I see, so it's the priestess. Dia-chan is a princess, after all!"

"Exactly. Today, we're set up as attendants serving Dia-kun. Youki-chan definitely thinks so, and Misha, you too."

"I see, you're making the top misunderstand, huh? That sounds fun! Being Dia-chan's attendant is better than being Karina's pet, so I'll go along with it!"

<b>

I thought a good friend would say something like that.

<b>

"Um... well, um? Older sister, Misha-san, I think it would be better to clear up this misunderstanding quickly."

"It's the one who misunderstands who's at fault, meow. Besides, when the other party is plotting something, this misunderstanding can actually be useful. Even if we reveal it, it should be after we determine we can trust them."

<b>

Hearing Misha say that, Dia-kun nodded, "Mmm, that's true."

In this regard, Misha is surprisingly shrewd.

<b>

Ah. Speaking of which, Misha still thinks the Five Elders are fake, but in this case, they're just having fun. It's not that I don't trust them.
