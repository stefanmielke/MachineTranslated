# It's worse to misunderstand

We easily smuggled ourselves into the empire. Our destination, the village of the demon tribe, was just around the corner.

.........seriously, Arthur, you're fast. A month on foot in a flash.

<blank>

I'm the Thunder Dragon!　It's been a while since I've been able to give it my all!

"You're doing pretty well for what you're doing.　You still feel like you've got it?"

I'm as mobile as you are.

"Well, I can walk to Tessin from here in one step. I can walk from here to Tessin in one step.

'...... sorry I lost!

<blank>

Well, if the Thunder Dragon has mobility, we can say that we arrived at the next town in a day or so from the previous town by putting this in front of the Thunder Dragon from now on. It's much faster than a magic tool car.

<blank>

And since we didn't want to take a dragon directly to the village of the demon tribe who were frightened of dragons, we sneaked down to a nearby area and switched to walking.

Container retracted. Arthur, too, became smaller, and he stood at its feet as if to protect Mr. Dear.

<blank>

And instead of adding Misha to my group, I put Aysia back at the base. I don't want to take her to a dangerous place just because I'm protecting her, and it's a place she can return to anytime and anywhere anyway.

He was a little reluctant to follow me, but I convinced him by creating a window from which he could look in on me from his base. I had used this technique before to tail pirates. I can hear them.

<blank>

'Um, where is the half-dwarf ......?　He was still in the box, wasn't he?"

Yes, that's right. Okay, let's go then, shall we, Yoki-chan?"

"And, you know..."

'I'm just staying, don't worry about it. Come on, let's go, shall we?　You want me to do something about the dragons?"

Yes, yes...... miko princess, my followers, please follow me."

<blank>

And then Yohki led the way, with me, Dia and Misha following in that order.

It's a formation that completely protects the princess.

<blank>

Arthur, Misha, make sure you protect the princess!"

I'm sorry, I'm sorry!　Roger that, Miss!

Oh, you're in charge!　You're in charge!　But if the dragon comes out, I'll leave it to you!"

<blank>

Ei, ei, oh!　and we who are united.

<blank>

"Well, princesses are ...... rather than your sister, who also has the status of a Dwarf prince. ...... No, that's enough."

"Nya?　It was Prince Karina?"

Don't tell anyone, okay?　I had Mee-chan make me a fake ID."

Isn't that a crime in itself?

<blank>

Sorry, but this is a legitimate fake ID, duly processed by the Dwarf Queen. In this case, the "identity" is the forgery, not the "ID".

<blank>

<blank>

The village is basically made of wood, with a moat and wooden fences surrounding the village. The atmosphere is somewhat Japanese, like that of a farming village during the Warring States period.

<blank>

I will go into the village first to explain, Miko. Please wait for a while."

<blank>

Yuki looked at me and said, "We are waiting in front of the village.

Of course, his gaze was on Dear-kun.

<blank>

I see, miko princess. Dia-chan is a princess, right?

Yes, yes. Today, we are the servants of Mr. Dear. I'm sure Yuki thinks so, and I'm looking forward to working with Misha, too.

I see, you've got the top management all wrong. That sounds like fun!　I'd rather be Dia's follower than Kalina's pet, and I'll ride her!"

<blank>

I knew my best friend would tell me that.

<blank>

"Yeah. ...... that, huh?　Sister, Misha, I think we should clear up this misunderstanding as soon as possible."

It is worse to misunderstand. And if the other party is planning something, this misunderstanding may come to life. You have to be sure that you can trust them before you tell them.

<blank>

When Misha says so, Dia-kun is convinced, "Mugu, indeed.

This is the kind of place where Misha is more deft than you might think.

<blank>

Ah. Misha, by the way, still thinks the Five Elders are crackpots, but this is just the Five Elders playing with us. It's not that I don't trust him.
