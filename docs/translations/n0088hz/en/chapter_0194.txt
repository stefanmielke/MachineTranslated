# This country might not be good for education

<b>

Surrounded by the three countries of the Teshin Gidoraga Empire and the Pavelkant Kingdom, the small nation of Terrarialby. Its borders were crossed without incident.

The ID I received from Mi-chan is very convenient, especially since we passed through in 'Dwarf's New Work'.

<b>

So. I was currently driving towards the capital, Terrariawan.

<b>

"Terrarialby, just one day after crossing the border to the capital, or rather, a country that barely has a capital."

"Sometimes small countries are like that, my lord."

<b>

If Aisia, who is knowledgeable about travel, says so, I can easily accept it.

Well, in reality, there are rural areas and pioneer villages around the capital, but there was only one post town along the way.

We skipped that post town since we sped through.

<b>

"Since it's Terrariawan, I wonder if there’s a Terraria Two or something?"

"There were brother countries called Terrarianya and Terrariapaon here."

<b>

Not a number, but the sound of a dog barking, huh.

<b>

"Then, are there country names like Terrariasapphire or Terrariascarlet?"

"No, although they are brother countries, it seems there was originally a great nation called Terrarial. It is said that it split into countries like Terrarialar, Terrarialby, and Terrarialsea due to a civil war."

<b>

The country name was B, not Ruby. A bit confusing.

<b>

<b>

...Well, it doesn't really matter!

The country we are in is Terrarialby, and our destination is the capital, Terrariawan!

As long as I understand that, it's all good!

<b>

Now then. We arrived at the capital, Terrariawan, without any particular incidents.

<b>

Once again, Terrarialby. This country, ruled by Beast King Barbaros, thrives mainly on tourism.

The main attraction is the coliseum located in the capital.

The violent spectacle of blood and guts was a hugely popular event even in ancient Rome on Earth. It is also very popular in this world.

Due to its popularity, there are several arenas in the capital, Terrariawan, in addition to the central circular arena. It seems that various tournaments are held there almost every day.

<b>

For now, there seems to be a small tournament at a nearby arena, so I’ll take Aisia and Dia-kun to watch. It seems standing spectators are also allowed.

The standing spectator fee for this tournament is five copper coins, which means one middle copper coin. That’s three people, cha-ching.

<b>

In the center is the ring, surrounded by seats for spectators. You need to purchase tickets for S seats or A seats in that area. We are standing spectators, so we are in the tiered outer seats surrounding those chairs.

<b>

It feels similar to pro wrestling or boxing events. About 80% of the seats around the ring are filled.

Half of them are beastmen, I’d say. I estimate that about 10% are fluffy types like Mashiro-san.

<b>

"Just as expected from a beastman country, there are many beastmen. But there are quite a few other people too."

"Of course, my lord, this is a tourist spot, after all?"

"It seems like it could earn foreign currency. Ah, I guess it actually is earning it."

<b>

I see, it makes sense that there are many tourists, including us, since it is a tourist spot.

And Dia-kun's observation is practical. That part is cute too.

<b>

<b>

After a short wait, the match began.

The tournament rules are bare-knuckle fighting without magic. Enhancement magic is also prohibited, so honestly, if I participated, I would lose.

Two sun-tanned, muscular men—one a bear-eared beastman and the other a human—are engaged in a pure fistfight.

<b>

Whoa, the sound of fists hitting flesh is quite intense.

I wonder if the two next to me are okay watching this... I glance at Aisia.

<b>

"That's it! Go! Smash him!! Good job!!"

<b>

She’s really into it!! Wait, Aisia cheers like that!?

Huh, is it a given that bards enjoy things that are popular or liked by the general public?

...What about Dia-kun? A glance!

<b>

"That punch has a sharp aim. Is it the quality of the muscles...?"

<b>

He was saying something while looking at his own slender arms.

<b>

D-Dia-kun, you mustn't become muscular!!

Ugh, this country might not be good for education...!!
