# This country may not be good for education

<blank>

Terra Realby is a small country surrounded by three countries: Tessin, the Gidlaga Empire, and the Kingdom of Pavelkant. Its borders were passed without incident.

The ID card that Mee gave me is very useful, as I can go by "New Dwarf" for my car as well.

<blank>

In. Now they were driving to the capital, Terraaliawan.

<blank>

Terra Realvy, only a day across the border and you're in a country with a capital, or almost only a capital.

Sometimes that happens in small countries, my Lord.

<blank>

I can easily agree that if Isiah, who knows a lot about traveling, says so, it must be so.

Well, in fact, although there were farming villages and pioneer villages around the capital, there was only one inn town on the way.

I skipped the car, so I didn't go through the inn town.

<blank>

I wonder if there is such a thing as Terraria One, or Terraria Two."

'You had a brother country here called Terrariaña, Terraria Paon.

<blank>

I think it was the dog barking, not the one.

<blank>

So the country name would be Terraria Sapphire or Terraria Scarlett?"

No, it is a brother country, but originally there was a large country called Terra Real, which split off into Terra Real Ar, Terra Real Bee, and Terra Real Sea. I have heard that it was divided into Terra Real Ar, Terra Real Bee, and Terra Real Sea after it became independent due to a civil war.

<blank>

Was the country name B, not Ruby? A subtle complication.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Well, what does it matter?

The country we are in is Terra Realby, and our destination is Terra Riawan, whose capital is Terra Riawan!

It's good if you know that much!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, well, well. We arrived at the capital, Terraaliawan, without any particular incident.

<blank>

Once again, Terra Realby. The country, ruled by Barbaros the Beast King, thrives mainly through tourism.

The mainstay of its tourism is the Coliseum in the capital.

The blood-boiling, blood-dancing, blood-splattering, and boisterous spectacle was a very popular entertainment even in ancient Rome. They are also very popular in this world.

Because of its great popularity, the capital Terraaliawan has several arenas in addition to the large circular arena in the center. And I hear that some kind of tournament is held there every day.

<blank>

In the meantime, I heard that there is a small tournament in the arena near here, so I'll take Isiah and Dia to watch it. I heard that it is OK to stand around and watch the tournament.

The standing-room-only ticket for this tournament is five copper coins, or one medium copper coin, for three people.

<blank>

The ring is in the center, and chairs for spectators are lined up around it. You have to buy tickets for S or A seats in that area. We were standing around, so we were seated on the outside of the terraced area around the chairs.

<blank>

The image is similar to that of a professional wrestling or boxing show. The seats around the ring are 80% occupied.

Of these, half are beasts. About 10% of them are fluffy like Mr. Masirow.

<blank>

I guess it's a country of beastmen, so there are a lot of beastmen here. But there are also many other people.

"Well, sir, this is a tourist spot, you know?"

'I like the idea of earning foreign currency. Yeah, you're actually making money."

<blank>

Well, it is natural that there are many tourists, including us, in the tourist area.

And Dear's impression is practical. That's cute, too.

<blank>

<blank>

After a short wait, the game began.

The rules of the tournament are bare-knuckled goro with no magic. Since reinforcing magic is also prohibited, to be frank, if I entered this tournament, I would lose.

A pure fistfight between two men - one a bear-eared beastman, the other a human - with dazzlingly muscular, muscular bodies.

<blank>

Oh, the sound of the fist hitting the meat is quite gruesome.

I wonder if the two people on either side of me would be okay with me showing them something like this. ...... glanced at Isiah.

<blank>

There it is!　Go!　Smash it!　Go, go, go, go!

<blank>

I'm in the groove!　I mean, you're going to cheer like that, Isiah!

Oh, bards have a natural taste for fads and things that the public seems to like?

...... Dear, what about you?　Chillax!

<blank>

'That punch, your aim is sharp. Maybe it's the quality of the muscle. ......"

<blank>

He was saying something while looking at his own thin arms.

<blank>

Dee, Dee, don't you get all muscly!

Ugh, this country may not be good for education. ......!
