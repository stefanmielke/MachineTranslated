# King of the Sea (Gomez's Perspective)

<blank>

<blank>

The sacred vessel "Poseidon". It is the heart of the ship and the ship itself.

<blank>

He is usually able to steer and power the ship as he pleases. Even when the horizon is empty as far as the eye can see, the crystal ball on the altar allows him to know the position of himself and other vessels. No need for a sextant.

<blank>

A ship with a built-in "Poseidon" is not a good place for enemies to enter.

That means that when we are adjacent to our prey's ship, no enemy can board us at all. The only ones who can enter are those who have boarded the ship with us.

In other words, it is about the size of a prisoner of war that we have neutralized.

<blank>

In addition to the power of searching and maneuvering the ship, it also has the power of 'absolute defense at sea.

It repels all attacks, and even when ships collide with each other, they always win. Those who try to board the ship to counterattack are bounced by an invisible force field and thrown into the sea to become seaweed.

It is a deserved reward for those who tried to challenge the god of the sea.

<blank>

In addition, ships with "Poseidon" are not attacked by marine monsters.

There is no such thing in the sea as an infidel who attacks "Poseidon," the god of the sea.

So there is no need for the magic circle to repel demons that is required for regular transports.

<blank>

<blank>

I am, after all, the king of the sea, recognized by God.

He was a king.

<blank>

"Hey, a ship is ...... a ship, a ship!

<blank>

-The boat, the source of its power, had not only been cut in half, it had disappeared.

<blank>

"...... is aaaaah!"

<blank>

The sea, incidentally, was also cut into squares. The ship and part of the sea disappeared, leaving only us, the crew.

A few moments too late, we fell into the cut-off sea - an impossible experience, being sandwiched and sunk by waves from the front, back, left and right while still in the ocean.

<blank>



<blank>

The surrounding minions are being pushed and squeezed by the waves.

Get away from me, you idiot, you can't swim in this!　and pushed aside the idiots around him and headed for the water.

<blank>

Phew!　Face to the surface of the water.

<blank>

What the hell is going on?

"Oops. That's our captain, he came up on his own."

<blank>

There was a small rowboat and ...... a woman standing on it looking down at us.

What is this guy?　Who is she?　The woman who disappeared with the shipment at the warehouse. The woman who humiliated me. The woman who threw the golem away with her bare hands.

...... Oh?　Why?　How did this happen?　I can't get my head around it.

<blank>

Kisa, ma'am!　What did you do!　What do you have against me?

Eh?"　I don't have any particular grudge against you, but I'm a robber, apparently. I tried to rob a boat too, you know!　I mean, you said you were asked to do it by the client."

<blank>

A woman laughing.

Damn!　What's so funny!　Oh, I'm pissed off to no end!

<blank>

Give it all back now!　Then I'll forgive you!　And give me that boat!"

Haha, why?　I don't really need to be forgiven by you, I am. I'm a salesman."

<blank>

I can't get close to him because of the oar!　You're making me look like a fool!

<blank>

You should take a dip in seawater, cool off and calm down. You're the only one who's that tense.

<blank>

When I turned my head to look, I saw that my men were sticking their heads out of the water, just like me. They were in a terrible, frightened state.

<blank>

"Hey, you know what?　We're in the middle of the ocean.

Yes, it is!　Undo it now!　Everything!　Then I can make you my bitch!"

What?　Are you an idiot?　Is that a negotiation?　The more you use it, the crazier you will become. Is that the price to pay for using the power of God?

Hanh."　Yes, I know. I don't know what kind of a cowardly move you've made, but I've got the god of the sea, the invincible Poseidon, with me..."

<blank>

-- "Poseidon" is a ship.

And there are no boats. There is not. No, because there is no!

<blank>

Aaaaah!"　That's right!　Hey, hey, give it back!　That's my ship!　It's God's power!　That's my power!"

'Uh, you finally understand now?'

You give me back my ship, my cargo, and everything will be all right!　Give it back, give it back!

No seriously, it's amazing you can say that much in this situation."

<blank>

A woman who says something incomprehensible and sighs.

I mean, I'm asking this much of you, so you should give it back!

Why don't you return it!

<blank>

"You guys?　The ones who beg for their lives, I'll take you to the boat you see over there, okay?"

<blank>

The woman pointed to a small boat that was supposed to be our prey - our prey.

<blank>

"Ha, proud Gomesti pirates begging for their lives..."

Please help me!

I don't want to die either!"

"You guys!　What the hell are you doing begging this guy for your life?

<blank>

I stood and swam and punched one of the idiots who begged for his life.

<blank>

"Shut up!　We don't have a ship, and you're not the captain anymore!"

Huh?

<blank>

His minions hit back. Silly, I'm the captain of a ship!　Silly ......

<blank>
