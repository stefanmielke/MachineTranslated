# I really didn't know.

Suppressing the excitement bubbling up since morning, I tidied myself up and met up with Dia-kun.

<b>

"What are we doing today?"

"Well, how about some sightseeing? How about you, Sati-tan?"

"Ah, sorry, Karikari. I have to leave soon."

<b>

It seems Sati-tan has a packed schedule for her peddling.

<b>

"By the way, Karikari seems to have it easy. If you miss the regular delivery here, the next one is about half a month later... Oh wait, you don't use the regular delivery, do you, Karikari? I might be a little envious."

"Well, it's a laid-back peddling life without worrying about other people's schedules."

"But still, you have few sales channels, right? If you're selling to stores, your profits must be small. Ah, so you're making money as an adventurer."

<b>

Hmm, it does seem like the earnings as an adventurer are higher. Like lumberjacks.

By the way, normally, peddlers are said to develop sales channels and make profits by selling to ordinary people unrelated to the guild. Really? I didn't know that.

<b>

"Don't you have that honey you were wholesaling, Karikari? Check the retail price. It's at least two to three times the wholesale price."

"Wait, really? Isn't that a rip-off?"

"Not really. You have to get that much to make a living as a peddler... Karikari, you really don't know anything, do you?"

<b>

Now that you mention it, if you're walking, it takes a month to sell, and with the added worry of being attacked by monsters or bandits, if the profits are too low, it wouldn't make sense.

<b>

In fact, for someone like me who has never even stocked enough to fill a backpack, it was still too early for me to peddle in Calcass. The profits were just too low.

<b>

By the way, Sati-tan, who owns a cart and has a liquor license, apparently receives subsidies from the guild for alcohol. So instead of going through the trouble of finding customers, she sells to guild-designated stores, which provides sufficient profits.

What? Is that really a thing? It's not just about cheaper transactions? I really didn't know. Did I hear something like that at the merchant guild?

<b>

"The merchant guild doesn't explain that much. Do you understand 'vested interests'? But well, the subsidies are provided based on national policy."

<b>

In other words, it means that people who already have rights and profits are keeping quiet to benefit themselves or to pass it on to their children. What a situation.

Wait, isn't that illegal? If they answer when asked, isn't it not illegal? I see.

<b>

"Normally, you learn from your merchant parents or mentors. It's common sense if you want to become a merchant..."

"I don't have anyone like that. Did you, Sati-tan?"

"I did! I won a drinking contest and took the liquor license and this magical backpack from them!"

<b>

Hmph, Sati-tan, the brown-skinned little girl merchant, proudly puffs out her flat chest.

It seems that vested interests are limited in number. And the magical backpack has more capacity than it looks, but only for alcohol, and it has a protective enchantment. The alcohol stored in the backpack stays in optimal condition and doesn't break the bottles.

<b>

Huh? Could it be an artifact...? No, let's not go there. If Sati-tan has it, it means it's being used appropriately and healthily. Besides, I've heard that the adventurer guild also has magic backpacks for lumberjacks, so it probably isn't that special.

<b>

"Well, still, by transporting a lot of products, I can make a profit. So, I have to say goodbye to you here, Karikari, to earn with my own cart."

"Mm-mm, that's too bad. I wanted to talk about love more..."

"Yeah, me too, Karikari... I'll keep the massage machine you gave me last night a secret until you start selling it."

<b>

Oh, I actually sold that. Probably as a demonstration.

<b>

"I'll also take good care of Sati-tan's socks...!"

"That's really confusing, so I'm genuinely perplexed."

<b>

This body has a bad embedded fetish... yeah. It really hits hard, Sati-tan's used socks. Just sniffing them is intense. Even the gods would give it a perfect score.

<b>

<b>

At that moment, Dia-kun interrupted with a letter in hand.

<b>

"By the way, Sati-san. Here you go. It's a letter of introduction for the immigration inspection."

"Huh? ...Really!? Is it okay!?"

"No problem. However, it states that you should take the inspection seriously, so it's best not to give false reasons."

"Yes, yes, thank you, Dia-sama! As a thank you, you can hug Karikari tonight! In a sexual way!"

"Wait, sold out by my lover? Sati-tan, are you abandoning me!? We loved each other so passionately yesterday! Even though I don't remember!"

"Sorry, Karikari. After all, you're just a plaything of a lover."

"Ugh, I was just a plaything! I was toyed with! But I still love youâ€”!"

<b>

As we were having such a farce, Dia-kun shrugged his shoulders.

<b>

"...It's better not to make such jokes in the elf country. Yes. Elves prefer sincerity in love."

"Okay. Sorry, I really love you, Karikari, but I like alcohol more."

"Yeah, me too, Sati-tan. Oh, I like you more than alcohol, you know?"

<b>

Dia-kun, while blushing, deflected the comment. We enjoyed the farce just a little longer.

By the way, Dia-kun? Do you understand the meaning of that statement...? No way? This little precocious one! So cute!

<b>

"Ah, I need to rearrange my peddling schedule. Hehe. Well then, Karikari. Please take care of Ai-neesan~"

<b>

With that, Sati-tan waved her hand cheerfully and set off.

See you again, Sati-tan. Until that day, keep those socks warm!
