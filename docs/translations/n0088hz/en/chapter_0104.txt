# I seriously didn't know about this.

I suppressed my morning craziness, cleaned myself up, and met up with Mr. Dia.

<blank>

What are you going to do today?"

"Well, let's go see the sights, shall we?　How about you, Sati?"

Oh, sorry Crunchy. I should get going."

<blank>

Satitan seems to have a full schedule of peddling.

<blank>

I'm sure you can afford it. If you miss a flight, the next one will be in half a month or so. ......," said Crunchy, "You don't use regular flights, do you? I might be a little jealous."

Well, I'm a carefree slow-life peddler who doesn't have to worry about other people's schedules."

But you still don't have many sales channels, do you?　If you're wholesaling to stores, you probably don't make much profit, either. Ah, you make money as an adventurer?

<blank>

Hmmm, I think I certainly make more money as an adventurer. Like a lumberjack.

By the way, I heard that normally peddlers develop a sales channel and make a profit by doing business with ordinary people who have nothing to do with the guild. Really, I didn't know that.

<blank>

You know that honey they used to sell wholesale at Crunchy's?　Look at the store prices. They are at least double or triple the wholesale price.

"Oh, really?　You're not getting ripped off?"

Not really. I have to get that much to make a living as a peddler. ......Crunchy, you really don't know anything."

<blank>

If you ask me, it would not be worth it if it took a month to sell the goods on foot, with the worry of being attacked by demons and wild thieves included, and if the profit was not so great.

<blank>

In fact, I still have never purchased enough to fill my backpack, and I was originally too young to peddle to Carcassa. Too unprofitable.

<blank>

By the way, Sati-tan, who has a carriage and a liquor license, is subsidized by the guild only for alcoholic beverages. So, instead of going through the hassle of finding customers every time, he can make enough profit by wholesaling to the guild's designated stores.

What's that, is there such a thing?　Not just a cheaper deal?　I seriously didn't know that. Did I hear something like that in the merchant guild?

<blank>

The Merchants Guild doesn't explain that much to me. Vested interests, you know?　But, well, the subsidies themselves come from government policy.

<blank>

So you are saying that people who already have rights and benefits are keeping quiet so that they can gain as they are or pass them on to their own children or something. What a mess.

Oh, it's not illegal?　It's not illegal if you answer when asked? I see.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a common sense thing to do if you're going to be a merchant, but I'm sure you'll learn it from your parents. It's common sense if you're going to be a merchant. ......"

I didn't have one of those. Was Satitan there?"

"There he is.　I won the drinking contest and took your liquor license and this magic backpack.

<blank>

Saty-tan, a young brown merchant woman, proudly flaunts her flat chest.

Vested interests are said to be limited to a certain number. And the magic backpack is limited to alcohol, has more capacity than it looks, and is said to have the blessing of conservation. The liquor in the backpack stays in optimal condition and the bottles don't break.

<blank>

Hmm?　Maybe that's a sacred object. ...... No, let's not. If Satitan has it, it means that it is a sacred artifact, but used in a proper and healthy way. Besides, I heard that there are magic bags for lumberjacks in the Adventurer's Guild, so it's not that special.

<blank>

I'll have to part with my crunchy wagon to earn my own money," he said. I'm going to say goodbye to Crunchy now so that I can earn money with my own wagon.

'Mmmm, too bad. I wanted to talk more about love. ......"

Yeah, me too, Crunchy. ...... The massager you shared with me last night, I'll make sure it's a well-kept secret until Crunchy starts selling them."

<blank>

Oh, I was selling it right there, I was. Probably by demonstration.

<blank>

I'll take good care of Sati's socks too. ......!

I don't know what that means, so I'm really confused."

<blank>

It's a bad sex habit embedded in this body. ...... Yeah. I'm really getting off on this, Sati-tan's used socks. Just by sniffing it, it's so bad. God will give it 100 points.

<blank>

<blank>

And then Mr. Dear interrupted with a letter in his hand.

<blank>

Yes, Mr. Satie. Here you are. Here is a letter of introduction for you to go through immigration."

Hmmm?" ...... seriously!　That's good!"

No problem. However, it does say that the screening process should be taken seriously, so you shouldn't give false reasons."

'Yes, thank you, Master Dear!　You can hold Crunchy tonight as a thank you!　I mean sexually!"

Choo, about being sold to my girlfriend. Sati-tan, you're dumping me!　We made love so intensely yesterday!　I don't remember!"

I'm sorry, Crunchy. I'm just a playful lover.

I was a playful lover!　I've been played!　But I love you!

<blank>

After a farce like that, Dear shrugged his shoulders in disappointment.

<blank>

You can also say, "...... You shouldn't make those kinds of jokes in the land of the elves. Yes, it is. Elves prefer honesty in love as well."

'Hi. Sorry, I love you properly, Crunchy, although I prefer alcohol."

I like you too, Sati-tan. Oh, I like Sati-tan better than alcohol, don't you?"

<blank>

Dia-kun is embarrassed but accepts it. We enjoy ourselves in the farce for a little while longer.

Or rather, Dear Mr.?　You know what I mean when I say ......?　You little smarty pants!　You're so cute!

<blank>

I have to rearrange my peddling schedule. "Oh, I'll have to rearrange my peddling schedule," he said. Well, crunchy. Take care of my sister Ai, okay?

<blank>

With that, Satitan waved her hand and left with a smile on her face.

See you again Sati-tan. Keep your socks warm until then!
