# The Possibility of Being a Poisonous Human

<b>

I defeated the Red Hornet and stuffed it into Aisia's backpack.

Since I carefully plucked it by hand, it's in a relatively perfect condition as a material.

The wax collected from the Yellow Hornet is of a different quality, a bit more expensive and of higher quality. The purchase price will also rise, yay.

<b>

"Karikari, you're definitely more suited to being an adventurer."

"Really? Is that so? That's not true, Sati-tan. If you want, I can show you my special product, okay? Let's use that as proof that I'm suited to being a merchant."

"Special product? I'm a bit curious... what kind of alcohol is it?"

"It's not alcohol."

<b>

Ah, but since Karina-chan made a potion, I could have it mixed with alcohol... but that's not a good idea. The recovery amount would probably be insane, and it might even be poisonous.

I've heard that the livers of polar bears and seals, which are rich in vitamin A, can be toxic to humans. I wonder if the same can be said for mana.

<b>

Huh? So if someone were to taste my blood, which is full of mana, they could potentially die...? Scary, it seems I've developed the possibility of being a poisonous human.

<b>

"We've defeated the boss we aimed for, so shall we head back?"

"Huh? Dia-san, aren't we going to check the middle layer?"

"Yes. Since Sati-san is here, safety first. The middle layer has many ant and spider-type monsters. The acid from ants can dissolve iron, right?"

"Ugh. That's true. I don't want to encounter them too much, so I'm grateful to turn back..."

<b>

Sati-tan looks disheartened. The weapon's bottle is made of iron, so she probably wants to avoid enemies that can dissolve iron... Could it be that she hesitated in front of the boss room because she didn't want to go to the middle layer?

<b>

"By the way, we haven't run into any other adventurers at all. Aisia, are you avoiding them?"

"Yes. I'm trying to avoid them as much as possible. Also, the adventurers here mainly operate in the middle layer."

<b>

Speaking of which, the dungeon sandwich that Aisia brought back seems to have been made from monster ingredients from the middle layer.

It seems there are other staircases leading down to the middle layer, and there are multiple boss rooms like this one. Adventurers who primarily operate in the middle layer seem to take the shortest fixed route to get there, and there are almost boss rooms that don't spawn bosses (if they do, they're immediately dealt with on the way through, so they open up quickly).

<b>

Conversely, adventurers who want to test their skills like this will stray from that fixed route to explore or challenge the boss rooms.

<b>

<b>

"Then, I think I'll go to the middle layer next time when Sati-tan isn't around and I feel like it."

"Yes. Big sister, shall I take a quick look at the stairs?"

<b>

Oh, that's nice. If I record the coordinates here, I can enter the dungeon anytime.

For me, that means I can gather materials as much as I want. Hehehe.

<b>

After returning home from the dungeon, we decided to sell the materials.

The almost undamaged materials from the mid-boss, the Red Hornet... I wondered if it would cause a stir? But it was a bit anticlimactic that it was exchanged without any fuss. Well, in the lower layers, they're just weak enemies.

<b>

So, we divided it into four parts, including Aisia. Each of us earned eight silver coins.

<b>

"Having a porter makes for good earnings."

"Isn't it usually less?"

"Yeah, they end up throwing away materials they can't carry."

<b>

What a waste. Hand it over to me.

<b>

"Well, there are low-rank adventurers who pick that up to get by. You know, like orphaned adventurers."

"Orphaned adventurers."

<b>

They are orphans whose parents were adventurers and died on quests or in dungeons. Sometimes, the parents are terrible and abandon them here, leading to them becoming orphaned adventurers.

<b>

If Aisia, who conspicuously carries a large backpack, weren't here, those types would probably come up asking to be hired as porters or follow us around.

<b>

"That sounds dangerous."

"Yeah, both for those hiring and those being hired, as well as for those following and those being followed. Look at me, with this appearance? When I'm solo, I sometimes get underestimated and attacked, but I fight back."

"That's so Sati. I've fallen for you again."

<b>

Dungeons are truly terrifying places.

(I'll be posting daily until the end of March!

After that, there will be book publication work and I don't know. I plan to rewrite a lot from volume one.

Estimated rate of new writing and revisions is probably over 70%...)
