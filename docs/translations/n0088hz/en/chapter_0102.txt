# Possibility of whole-body poisoned humans

<blank>

He slaughtered the Red Hornet and rammed it into Isiah's backpack.

It is in relatively perfect condition as a material since it was carefully stripped by hand.

The quality of the wax that can be collected is different from that of the Yellow Hornet, and it is a bit more expensive and of higher quality. The purchase price will go up, yay!

<blank>

"Crunchy, you're better suited to be an adventurer, I promise."

Yeah?"　I wonder. I don't think so, Sati. If you want, I can show you my best products.　I will prove to you that I am a suitable merchant.

I'm a little curious.　I'm a little curious ...... what kind of alcohol is it?"

I don't think it's alcohol."

<blank>

Oh, but I made a potion for Karina, so I'm not sure if I should ask her to mix it with alcohol ....... The amount of recovery is probably very bad, and if it's bad, it's poison.

I have heard that the livers of polar bears and seals, which are too rich in vitamin A, are poisonous to humans. I wonder if the same could be said for manna and the like.

<blank>

Hmm?　So if you lick my blood, which is full of mana, you will die if you are bad ......?　I'm scared, I might be poisoned all over my body.

<blank>

Now that we've defeated our target boss, let's go home."

Huh?"　Mr. Deere. Don't you want me to go look at the middle level?"

Yes. Sati is here, and safety is our first priority. There are a lot of ant species and spider species in the middle layer. Ant acids dissolve iron, don't they?"

Ugh. I don't want to run into them too often. I don't want to run into them too much, so thanks for turning back. ......"

<blank>

Satyan is disappointed. The bottle of alcohol is also made of iron, and I guess they want to avoid enemies that melt iron. ...... Maybe she didn't want to go to the middle level, so she was put off in front of the boss's room?

<blank>

By the way, I haven't seen you with any other adventurers at all. Aisia, are you avoiding them or something?"

Yes, I try to avoid it as much as possible. I avoid it as much as possible. And also, I think that adventurers here, in the main, are active in the middle level.

<blank>

Well, it seems that the dungeon sandwich that Isiah bought for me was also a mid-level monster ingredient.

So, it seems that there are other stairs down to the middle level, and there are several boss rooms like this one. Adventurers who mainly work in the middle level are said to take the shortest fixed route to the middle level, and there are boss rooms with almost no bosses (or if there are bosses, they are quickly opened because they are quickly eliminated by passersby).

<blank>

On the other hand, adventurers who want to test their skills in this way can deviate from the fixed route and explore, or open a boss room and challenge him or her.

<blank>

<blank>

Then, I'll go to the middle level and beyond next time when Sati is not around and I feel like it."

Yes, I'd like to take a look at the stairs. Sister, would you like me to take a look at the stairs for a moment?"

<blank>

Oh, great. If we record the coordinates here, we can enter the dungeon anytime we want.

If it's me, that means I can take all the materials I want. Hmph.

<blank>

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

We returned home from the dungeon and decided to sell our materials.

The middle boss, the Red Hornet's nearly intact material ......, I wondered if there would be any fuss.　I was a little disappointed that it was redeemed without any trouble at all. Yes, it's just a plain enemy in the lower levels, right?

<blank>

So, including Isiah, the money was divided into four equal parts; each person earned 8 silver coins.

<blank>

You make a lot of money when you have a porter."

Is it usually less?"

'Yeah, you throw away materials you can't hold onto and stuff.'

<blank>

What a waste. Give it to me.

<blank>

There are low-ranked adventurers who pick it up and eat it. You know, adventurer orphans.

The Adventurer's Orphan.

<blank>

These are orphans whose parents were adventurers and died in a commission or in a dungeon. Sometimes, the parents were assholes and left the children here to go off and become adventurer orphans.

(According to Basic Knowledge)

He also said that if it weren't for Isiah carrying a big backpack for show, such people would have come up to him and asked him to hire them as porters or followed him around.

<blank>

It's kind of dangerous.

Yes, there are many people who hire, who are hired, who are followed, and who are followed. I look like this, you know?　I've been attacked by people who think I'm a solo player, and I've gotten back at them.

I'm in love with you again. I'm in love with you again."

<blank>

Dungeons are such terrifying places, aren't they?

(We will post daily throughout March!

After that, I don't know because I have to work on book publication and so on.

(Estimated percentage of new writing and additions and revisions, I'm guessing 70%up ......)
