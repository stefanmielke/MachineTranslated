# The higher the expectations, the higher the hurdles

"Look, my lord, the instrument is ready!"

"Oh, it's done. ...Wait, the mallets are moving on their own!?"

<b>

When I looked at the xylophone called by Aisia, the mallets were floating in the air, striking the xylophone with a ping-pong sound.

No, this isn't on its own. It's playing exactly as Aisia had just struck it!

<b>

"Could it be that it can perform automatically? The bard skill?"

"Yes? If you can't do this, singing alone won't be enough for work."

<b>

Whaaat, what about the laws of physics in this world... oh right, it's a world with magic. I guess that doesn't apply.

<b>

"â€¦So, you don't do things like singing while playing?"

"Singing while playing? Ah, that's automatic performance. The hands are just there for show, and they actually move on their own with the skill, so there's no need to have them there. I mean, I can do singing while playing, but wouldn't it be better to focus on the singing for a better performance?"

<b>

It seems that bards in this world typically perform their instruments in advance unless it's a very spontaneous situation. ...An organ might not have any demand in this world!

<b>

Ah. Wait a minute?

Speaking of which, Aisia once said, "It's strange that I can't sing while playing the flute!" ...I see. The flute probably can also perform automatically in the same way. Surely, it would float in the air and perform automatically just like this xylophone.

<b>

If that's the case, it does seem a bit strange that you can't sing along with an automatically performing flute. It's a bit late, but I finally understand Aisia's attitude and remarks back then.

<b>

"Hm? So, when you're making the xylophone play, you can't do anything with both hands?"

"Well, I can do things that don't involve the bard skill, but... I can't do it very skillfully. Playing an instrument is impossible."

<b>

It seems that Aisia's dexterity is based on the bard skill. In other words, both arms' bard skills are 'in use.' With that, a one-person band is impossible.

...If that's the case, then there might still be a chance for the organ, right?

<b>

<b>

"Wow, that was quite fun! Thanks, I learned a lot! But if you're taking that home, I do need to charge you a fee. Just the cost of the ingots used, so five silver coins."

"I'll pay that much. Yeah. Thank you too."

<b>

Unexpectedly, Aisia got her hands on an instrument. Good job, Aisia, your performances will improve.

<b>

"So this xylophone is a gift for Aisia."

"Is it really okay? Thank you, I'll add some color to my life!"

"Oh, no need to be that enthusiastic."

<b>

Actually, I prefer a quieter atmosphere. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, by the way, do you need a kitchen knife or anything?"

"A kitchen knife, huh? I want one, but is it expensive?"

"If it's iron, not that much. If it's made by my dad, even iron ones are usually fifty silver coins, but I'm still just a novice, so mine would be about ten silver coins."

<b>

It seems this dwarf is only allowed to sell kitchen knives.

<b>

"If you want a kitchen knife, how about a knife?"

"Oh no, no. A knife can be a weapon, right? Weapons are still prohibited by my dad. He says there are many situations where you have to entrust your life, so it's only natural."

<b>

I see, a kitchen knife isn't something you'd use in an emergency.

It seems necessary to clearly state that when selling.

<b>

"If it's a kitchen knife made in a dwarf workshop, it can easily cut through regular knives."

"That's it. The products from our workshop are used that way, so my dad won't give permission for that..."

<b>

The higher the expectations, the higher the hurdles. It seems that a quality worthy of being called a dwarf workshop is required. The dwarf, who is on the receiving end of those expectations, let out a sigh.

<b>

"By the way, what kind of performance is expected from a dwarf's knife?"

"Well, if it's the same material, it should cut through regular swords cleanly."

"I have to make something like that... It sounds tough, huh, dwarf?"

"Yeah. It's tough. I'm glad you understand... So, it would be great if you could buy a kitchen knife for the sake of my training."

<b>

If it sells, I can make that much more. What a savvy businessman. Well, I guess I'll buy one.

Investing in the growth of a hardworking young person isn't something I mind.

<b>

...However, I will not use the funds as a merchant. After all, I'm still a complete novice in that regard!
