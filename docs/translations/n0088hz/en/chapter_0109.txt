# The more you expect, the higher the hurdle.

Look, Master, the instrument is ready!"

I said, "Oooh, you got it. ...... is some kind of bee moving on its own!"

<blank>

When Aisia called me over to look at the tetsuzin, I saw a bee floating in the air and striking the tetsuzin with a ping-pong pang-pong sound.

No, this is not on its own. It's ringing just as Isiah was tapping just before!

<blank>

'Well, no way, you can play automatically. Bardic skills?"

Huh?"　Yes. If you can't do this, singing alone won't do the job."

<blank>

Wow, what are the laws of physics? ...... was a world with magic. I don't know if that's true.

<blank>

...... like, don't you play or something?"

You play?　Oh. That's automatic playing. I just put my hand on it because it looks good, but in reality, I just put my hand on it because it moves on its own with my skill, and there is no need to put my hand on it. It's not impossible to play along, but.... Wouldn't the song be better if I concentrated on singing?"

<blank>

Bards in this world, unless the scene is very unexpected, it seems that instruments are played in advance. ...... music box, it may not be in demand in this world, even if you make it!

<blank>

Ah. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

You know, Isiah once said, "I can't sing while playing the flute, wonder!" I see that ....... I wonder if the flute can play automatically as well. Perhaps it can be played automatically while floating in the air, just like this zither.

<blank>

Surely that makes it a little strange that you can't sing in combination with an automatic flute, on the other hand, doesn't it? I know it's a little late for me to say this, but Isiah's attitude and statement at that time made sense to me.

<blank>

I was like, "Hm?　So, when you have the zither playing, can't both hands do anything?"

I can do things that don't involve my bardic skills, but I'm not very good at ...... playing a musical instrument. I can't play an instrument."

<blank>

It seems that Isiah's dexterity is bard skill compliant. In other words, both arms' worth of bardic skills are "in use". So a one-person band is not possible.

......Then there is still a way to make use of the music box, I guess?

<blank>

<blank>

I had a lot of fun!　Thanks, I learned a lot!　But if you want to take it back, you'll have to pay for it. Just pay me for the ingots you used, five silver coins."

I'll pay you that much. I'll pay you that much. Thank you.

<blank>

Unexpectedly, Aysia got a musical instrument. Yay, Isiah, you're making progress with your playing.

<blank>

So this harp is a gift for Isiah.

I'm glad you like it!　Thank you, I will add some color to your life!"

Oh, no, you don't have to be so uptight.

<blank>

I'm more the type of person who is more comfortable with quiet. Yeah, I'm the type of person who is more at ease in quiet.

<blank>

"Oh, well, don't you need a knife or something?"

I'd like to have a knife. I'd like to have one, but are they expensive?"

Not so much for iron. My father's iron made by him can easily cost 50 silver coins, but I'm still just an apprentice, and with mine it's only about 10 silver coins.

<blank>

This dwarf is only allowed to sell knives.

<blank>

If you want a knife, how about a knife?"

Oh no, no, no. A knife is a weapon, right?　My dad still forbids me to use weapons. Of course he has to, because there are a lot of situations where people's lives are on the line.

<blank>

I see. If it's a knife, it's not something you'd use in an emergency situation very often.

I heard that it is necessary to say so when selling.

<blank>

A knife made by the Dwarves' Workshop can cut through a knife like that with ease.

That's it. My father won't give me permission to use his workshop's products because they are used in such a way. ......

<blank>

The higher the expectations, the higher the bar. As one would expect from a dwarven workshop, quality is demanded. The dwarf on the receiving end sighs.

<blank>

By the way, what kind of performance do you expect from a Dwarf knife?

I'll just use any sword I can get my hands on."

I don't know if I'll ever have to make one of those. ...... That's a lot of work, Mr. Dwarf."

Yeah, it's tough. It's hard work. I'm glad you understand ......, so I'd appreciate it if you'd buy me a knife for my training."

<blank>

He said, "If I sell enough, I can make enough to cover the cost. Oh, well, he's a good businessman. Well, why don't you buy it?

We are not afraid to invest in the growth of hardworking young people.

<blank>

...... However, I shall not be using the funds as a shonin. As a merchant, I'm totally comfortable with it and I'm a new young man!
