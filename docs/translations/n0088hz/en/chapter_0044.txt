# I was told to do it. I'm not in the wrong, right?

(Karina-chan, who is barely not in the wrong)

----------------

<b>

<b>

Well, I committed robbery! Karina-chan is such a bad girl!

<b>

But there’s not a single piece of evidence left, just the testimonies of Gomez and the others.

Besides, since they said it was a robbery, it’s fine to call it a robbery, right...?

<b>

Rejoice, Gomez! You’ve got the robbery Karina-chan you hoped for! Even as a robber, I’m cute!

<b>

“Not here, not anywhere! What’s going on!”

<b>

Gomez is searching the warehouse, but there’s nothing to find. All the cargo that was in this warehouse is now in my storage space. I put everything away in an instant, including myself.

<b>

That said, this robbery is just a prank to the extent that I might consider returning it if they reflect on their actions.

Because I’m kind-hearted Karina-chan. The bar for reflection is set pretty high, though.

So, to check if they’re reflecting or not, I’m secretly hiding in the storage space and listening in. Yay, stakeout! By the way, the coordinates of the storage space are positioned to look down at Gomez from behind. It’s like a third-person view in a game.

<b>

I wonder if Gomez and the others will notice the optical camouflage peep hole a few meters behind them? I think it’s unlikely.

<b>

“Damn it! This is a huge loss!”

“This is going to affect various payments, isn’t it, Lord Gomez?”

“Wait, wait! This must be a dream or something…”

“Are you saying we’re also dreaming right now? It certainly looks like the cargo has disappeared, doesn’t it?”

<b>

It seems they’re having a dispute with their trading partner. Oh, how delightful.

<b>

“B-but I’ll manage! I’ll figure something out!”

“...No, that’s fine. To be honest, I don’t think that was human. We don’t want to get involved.”

“Huh? Not human? What are you talking about?”

“The other day, the slave trader from Sorashidore was captured. And not a single one of those who testified about that crime mentioned the reason for their stubborn refusal to confess, saying ‘I swore to God, so I can’t say.’”

<b>

Ah, so that’s how they ended up?

Not bad, it seems the intimidation worked quite well. Okay, I’m satisfied.

<b>

It would be nice to have Gomez and his pirate crew experience the same fate later, but if it’s too predictable, even the gods might get bored.

Besides, it seems they’re connected to the lord, so even if I make them confess, it might not lead to significant punishment. I’ll think of something else.

<b>

“And this is information from another source, but the Alchemy Kingdom was destroyed the other day.”

“...Destroyed!? The Alchemy Kingdom!? No, but what does that have to do with anything right now?”

“The Chaos God has apparently incurred the wrath of the gods. Do you understand what this means?”

“Huh? The wrath of the gods? What are you talking about?”

“The god who destroyed the Alchemy Kingdom might currently be in this world. ...If that woman is a god, then you’ve just picked a fight with a god.”

“N-no... there’s no evidence for that...”

<b>

Gomez looks stunned.

Ah, I see. When you put it that way, the merchant’s words might actually hold some truth. In fact, it’s quite close to the current situation.

Not a bad merchant after all. There’s a vibe that suggests he’s involved in some shady business, so I’ll keep an eye on him.

Marking him as a coordinate for spatial magic.

<b>

“This situation shows that the golem transported cargo over several hours, only for it to be instantly erased. Isn’t this evidence?”

“Guh...!”

“Please don’t bring any more business to us. We’ll pay the penalty for the ongoing project, and that’ll be the end of our relationship.”

“W-wait, Hans!”

“Sorry, Lord Gomez, I’ll pay you the money. But I don’t want to get involved!”

<b>

Saying that, the merchant left the warehouse, escaping from Gomez.

Left behind were Gomez and his subordinates.

<b>

“O... boss...”

“What should we do...!”

“Shut up! What’s this about gods! If there are gods, they’re on our side too!”

<b>

Oh? So you say the gods are on your side? That’s an interesting thing to say, Gomez.

<b>

<b>

“The divine artifact ‘Poseidon’! With this, we’ll be absolutely safe on the sea, and we’ll go for ‘procurement’!!”

<b>

<b>

No way, lucky me! I’ve found a divine artifact!!

<b>

Ah, but there’s that.

If this is for peaceful use and absolutely necessary for maintaining this town, I might let it slide... No, it’s not like Gomez needs to have it. I’ll just rob it. If it’s needed, I can just give it to someone else.

<b>

<b>

After all, I’m a robber now! Yay! I’ll do whatever I want with a perfect alibi!

<b>

<b>

Gomez and the others started moving somewhere. The current coordinates of the storage space are attached to Gomez, so I’ll automatically follow him. Spatial magic is quite versatile, isn’t it?

Since they mentioned the sea, they’ll probably head to a ship eventually, but it looks like they’re heading to a base on land first. Should I rob that too, or maybe let them swim for a bit? Hehehe.

<b>

“Oh, by the way, I wonder what was inside the cargo I collected from the warehouse. I haven’t checked yet since it’s all packed in wooden boxes.”

<b>

The wooden boxes that I moved directly into my storage space, Gomez’s cargo.

What’s Gomez’s is mine, and what’s mine is also mine. Now then, what’s inside the boxes?

I casually pulled out the bottom box from the pile of boxes nearby (using spatial magic discreetly) to check its contents.

<b>

Now, let’s meet the pirate’s treasure! Open the wooden box...

<b>

“...Wow.”

<b>

I made eye contact with what was inside.

There was a cute child with pointy ears—wait, could it be an elf child?
