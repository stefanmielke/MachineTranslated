# I was told to do it. It's not my fault, right?

(Just barely not bad, Carina.)


----------------

<blank>

<blank>

Oh no, I robbed them!　Karina, you are such a bad girl!

<blank>

But there is no evidence left at all, only the testimony of Gomes and others.

And since that side said it was a robbery, it should be a robbery. ......

<blank>

Rejoice, Gomez!　You're just what you wanted, little robber Karina!　I'm a cute little robber too, man!

<blank>

'No, no, nowhere!　What the hell is going on!"

<blank>

Gomez searches inside the warehouse, but there is no way it is there. All the stuff that was in this warehouse is in my storage space. I put it all away in an instant, myself included.

<blank>

However, this robbery is such a prank that I would be happy to return it if the other party is remorseful.

You're a kind-hearted girl, Carina. The bar for remorse is high, though.

So I secretly hide from the storage space to see if they are remorseful and listen to what they have to say. Yes, yes, a stakeout. By the way, the coordinates of the storage space are looking down on Gomez from behind. The coordinates are like this third person in the game.

<blank>

Will Gomez and the others notice the peephole, which is also optically camouflaged, a few meters above slightly to the rear?　I don't think so.

<blank>

Damn!　That's a hell of a lot of damage!"

This is going to be a problem to pay your bills, isn't it, Mr. Gomez?"

Wait a minute. This is a dream or something. ......"

Do you think we're dreaming right now, too?　Sure looks like your cargo is disappearing, doesn't it?"

<blank>

I think I'm in trouble with my business partner. Oh, it's a nice feeling.

<blank>

I'll figure it out!"　I'll figure it out!"

You said, "...... No, thank you. Frankly, I don't think that was a person. We don't want to get involved over here."

What about?　Not a person?　What are you talking about?"

The other day, a slave trader from Solacidore was captured. And none of those who testified to their crimes would say what caused them to turn themselves in, stubbornly saying, 'I swore to God I couldn't say.'"

<blank>

Ah. They got that kind of feeling?

OK, I'm satisfied.

<blank>

I like the idea of making Gomez and the other pirates suffer the same thing after this...oh, but God would get bored with one pattern.

I mean, he seems to be connected to the lords in the first place, so I can't really charge him with anything if I get him to confess. Let's think of something else.

<blank>

And this is from the other side of the coin, the other day the Alchemy Kingdom was destroyed.

"...... destroyed!　The Alchemy Kingdom!　No, but, what does that have to do with anything now?"

The god of chaos has touched the wrath of God. Do you know what this means?"

What is it?"　God's wrath?　What do you mean?"

'It's possible that the god who destroyed the alchemical kingdom is in this world right now. ...... If that woman is God, then you have just picked a fight with the very God."

You can ...... find proof of such a thing.

<blank>

Gomez is aghast.

Uh, yeah. I see. If you ask me, the merchant over here may be right. Or rather, it is quite close to the current situation.

He's a good merchant, isn't he? He seems to be involved in some nefarious activities, so I'll keep an eye on him.

It's marking as spatial magic coordinates.

<blank>

'This situation, the cargo that the golem carries for hours, was shown to disappear in an instant. Isn't this the proof?"

Ggghh ......!"

They said, "Can you please not bring this to us anymore? We'll pay you the penalty for the ongoing business, and we'll cut you off.

Wait, wait, Hans!

I'm sorry, Mr. Gomez, I'll pay you. But we don't want to get involved in this!

<blank>

With that, the merchant left Gomez to flee the warehouse.

Gomez and his crew left behind.

<blank>

"O ...... parent ......"

We, how can we ......!"

Shut up!　What god?　If there's a God, he's on our side too!"

<blank>

Oh?　God is with you?　That's an interesting point you're making, Mr. Gomez.

<blank>

<blank>

"The divine weapon 'Poseidon' is!　With this, we'll be absolutely safe on the sea, we'll 'stock up'!"

<blank>

<blank>

Seriously, Lucky!　I found it...a divine instrument!

<blank>

Ah, but that one.

If this is for peaceful use and you really need it to keep this town going, I'll let you off the hook. ...... No, you don't have to have it, Mr. Gomez. Let's rob it. If you need it, give it to someone else.

<blank>

<blank>

After all, I'm a robber now!　Yes, yes, yes!　I'll do whatever I want with a perfect alibi!

<blank>

<blank>

Gomez and the others began to move somewhere. The coordinates of the current storage space are attached to Gomez, so it automatically takes the form of a tail. Spatial magic is all-powerful, right?

They said something about being on the ocean, so I guess they'll eventually head for the boat, but first they appear to be heading for a base on land. Shall we rob that one too, or maybe just let them swim once?　Kukuku.

<blank>

I wonder what the contents of the warehouse were that we recovered. It's in a wooden box, so I haven't checked it yet.

<blank>

The crates and Gomes' cargo, which were moved intact into the storage space.

What's Gomez's is mine and what's mine is mine. Now, what's in the box?

I decided to quickly (casually, using spatial magic) pull out the bottom box of a nearby pile of boxes at random and check its contents.

<blank>

Now, meet the pirate treasure!　Pucker up the wooden box: ......

<blank>

...... wow."

<blank>

My eyes locked with what was inside.

There he was, a cute little kid with pointy ears - yes, I didn't expect an elf child, did I?
