Hermes, the thief, is after the sacred weapon, the Breaking Wall Hammer!

Ho, ho.

The "Breaking Wall Hammer" is a national treasure of Tessin!　Besides, it is an important sacred artifact that laid the foundation of Akahagane!"

Oh, yeah?"

 How could they go after it ......?"

"Oh, my God, that's terrible."

<blank>

You can't just say, ...... oh, it's invalid because it's a promise made after you've been drinking, you can't do that!

Because this is Dwarf country. Drinking is the norm.

<blank>

Yes. So I definitely have to protect it. Glad to have your help, Kari!"

<blank>

Mee-chan with a cute and flirty smile.

......Sorry, I can't say I'm going for that either. I can't say it!

<blank>

Oh, Isiah. ......

"Because the Uncle is a cheap shot, he's ......

<blank>

Huh, sighs Isiah. Sorry for being an unthinking master!

<blank>

What's wrong, Kari?　You look a little pale.

I'll take care of it!"　I'll take care of it!"

I'm so proud of you!　That's my Kari, she's so reliable!　I love you!"

<blank>

I was in a cold sweat while Mee-chan hugged me.

Ugh, what am I going to do with this... ......!

<blank>

<blank>

'...... sister, I guess we'll just have to hear you out here, won't we?'

I'm sure you're right, Deere!　What kind of a guy is Hermes?　Tell me, Mee-chan!

<blank>

In the meantime I decided to listen a little more.

<blank>

Hermes is a thief who uses various magical tools, magic and skills to steal. He always steals the treasure he targets. He always steals the treasures he targets, and he does it with a warning.

"...... heh, cool ain't it?"

It's certainly a popular subject for stories," he said!　But it's not so easy for the person who is served with a warning letter!　Even if you have tight security, they will steal from you as if they are mocking you!"

<blank>

Mee-chan is getting into a cute getup.

<blank>

Besides, we are told that Hermes only steals from the wicked."

"Huh?　Oh, Mee-chan was a bad guy?"

No, I'm not!　Oh, no, we've done a few shady things, but ...... we're upholding the law, and we're governing this place for the public welfare!　Trust us, Kari!

<blank>

Wow, that's a little hard to believe. But I do. Because she is a lovely wife.

<blank>

I mean, when you're a target, that kind of ugliness comes with it, so it's even worse."

I know. If they steal the 'Breaking Wall Hammer' on top of this, ...... we're screwed in so many ways. ......

<blank>

I see.

......

<blank>

No seriously, what should I do? If I bring a sacred object, will my wife be disqualified?　Something like that?

It's kind of like I can't take it with me anymore ......

<blank>

If Kari doesn't help us, ...... we may be held responsible and executed."

I'll protect you, I promise!"

Really?　Wow!"

<blank>

Wow, so cute. I want to protect this smile!

<blank>

I was assigned to guard the "Breaking Wall Hammer" at .......

Fearless Mee-chan. What a little devil!

<blank>

"Dear Vermillion, even though you are much younger, this behavior is ......

"Considering your age, ...... isn't that a little hard?　Don't be too hard on your old lady."

'Oh well, you're human, so you don't know the age of the dwarves. Poor thing."

<blank>

Hey, you beards!　I don't know for sure!　I know you're bad-mouthing my wife!

And before I could glare, Mee-chan smiled at me and the bearded guys were frightened. Haha, they were pressured by a little girl's smile. Ya-ya-ya.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, Kari, have you ever seen "The Breaking Wall Hammer"? Kari, have you ever seen "The Breaking Wall Hammer"?　No?　Then let's go see it together now!

Uh, yeah.

'Hehehe, it's a date, isn't it, Kari!

<blank>

Mee-chan pulls me by the arm and takes me to the back of the museum.

<blank>

I have a feeling your sister ...... is getting more and more swamped."

I'm not sure if she has any deep thoughts about it. 

It's the boss, and he can handle anything. Because it's the boss, you know?"

<blank>

All three of you are good, come with me, I can't resist Mee-chan's little devilish forcefulness if it's just me...!
