"The Phantom Thief Hermes is after the divine artifact 'Wall-Breaking Hammer'!"

"Oh, really?"

"The 'Wall-Breaking Hammer' is a national treasure of the Teshin! Moreover, it's an important divine artifact that laid the foundation for Akahagane!"

"Is that so?"

"This town of ours, this country exists undoubtedly thanks to the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer'... It's something that could be said to be the cornerstone of the dwarves' souls. To target that...!"

"That's quite a predicament."

<b>

Since it's a promise made while drinking, I can't just say it's invalid... Ah, that's impossible, isn't it?

Because this is the land of the dwarves. Drinking is the default here.

<b>

"Yes. So we absolutely have to protect it. I'm so glad to have your cooperation, Kari-chan!"

<b>

Mii-chan beams with a cute smile.

...I'm sorry, but I can't say that I'm after it too. I can't bring myself to say it!

<b>

"Ah, Aishia..."

"Master keeps agreeing to things so easily..."

<b>

Aishia lets out a sigh. I'm sorry for being such a thoughtless master!

<b>

"What's wrong, Kari-chan? You look a bit pale?"

"Ah, um, it's nothing! Just leave it to me!"

"Kya! As expected of our Kari-chan, so reliable! I love you!"

<b>

While being hugged by Mii-chan, I was sweating nervously.

Waaah, what should I do about this...!!

<b>

<b>

"…Sister, I think we have no choice but to listen to the story first?"

"Y-You're right, Dia-kun! What kind of person is Hermes? Tell me, Mii-chan!"

<b>

For now, I decided to listen to a bit more of the story.

<b>

"Hermes is a phantom thief who uses various magical tools, spells, and skills to commit theft. He always steals the treasures he targets. And he does it with a warning letter, you know."

"…Wow, that's cool, isn't it?"

"Certainly, it's popular as a story theme! But for those who receive a warning letter, it's a nightmare! Even if they tighten security, he steals as if mocking them!"

<b>

Mii-chan stamps her feet cutely.

<b>

"Moreover, it's said that Hermes only steals from villains."

"Really? Wait, was Mii-chan a villain?"

"Of course not! Ah, well, I have done some shady things... but I follow the law properly and work hard for the public welfare to govern this place! Trust me, Kari-chan!"

<b>

Wow, that's a bit hard to believe. But I want to believe it. Because she's such a cute lady.

<b>

"In other words, once targeted, such scandals come along, making it even more troublesome."

"Exactly. If the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer' gets stolen... then, everything for us will be over..."

<b>

I see, I see.

……

<b>

No, seriously, what should I do about this? If the divine artifact is taken, will my lady lose her position? 

It feels like I can't just take it away...

<b>

"If you don't help me, Kari-chan... I might be held responsible and executed."

"I will absolutely protect you!"

"Really!? Yay!"

<b>

Wow, so cute. I want to protect this smile!

<b>

...And so, I've ended up in charge of guarding the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer'.

Mii-chan is truly fearsome. What a little devil!

<b>

"Lord Vermilion, although you've rejuvenated quite a bit, this behavior..."

"Considering your age... isn't it a bit harsh? Old lady, don't push yourself."

"I see, since you're human, you wouldn't know dwarven ages. How pitiful."

<b>

Hey, you bearded guys! I may not know, but I can tell you're talking bad about my lady!

Before I could glare, Mii-chan smiled at the bearded men, and they flinched. Haha, they're overwhelmed by a little girl's smile. Ha ha ha.

<b>

<b>

"Oh. Kari-chan, have you ever seen the 'Wall-Breaking Hammer'? No? Then let's go see it together now!"

"Ah, okay."

"Hehe, it's a date, Kari-chan!"

<b>

I was pulled along by Mii-chan's arm into the depths of the museum.

<b>

"…I feel like the sister is sinking deeper into the swamp."

"Indeed. Well, I guess the sister must have some deep thoughts... or maybe not?"

"Since it's our master, everything will be fine. After all, it's our master, right?"

<b>

All three of you, just come along! I can't resist Mii-chan's little devilish insistence on my own!
