# Infiltrating the Pirate Ship!

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. I was seen off by a cute elf boy named Dia (on the spot) and infiltrated a pirate ship to save his older sister!

I’ll sneak around the ship using optical camouflage! It seems there’s also a divine artifact, so I’ll snatch that too!

<b>

<b>

So, here I am, the elegant thief Karina, infiltrating. This is my first time seeing such a large wooden ship in person, so I’m a bit excited.

<b>

Since I have no leads, I’ll just follow Gomez for now.

……Oh, I guess I didn’t need to come out of the storage space? Well, whatever. If I go back now, Dia-kun’s gaze will probably turn cold, so I’ll just go like this. Ninja style, sticking to the ceiling.

<b>

“Damn it, anyway, we need to stock up quickly or we’ll be doomed! It’s all that woman’s fault! We’ve already received the money!!”

“Boss, what should we do?”

“First, let’s look for our prey! In this case, let’s just attack those with permits that are expired!”

“W-won’t the lord be furious if we do that!?”

“Shut up!! If we keep quiet, we won’t get caught!! We’ll cover our tracks later!”

<b>

Gomez walks briskly toward the center of the ship.

There, he finds a door with slightly more luxurious decorations than the others. It’s clear at a glance that it’s an important room.

<b>

“Poseidon! Great god of the sea! Reveal to me the location of the insolent ones who dare to cross above!”

<b>

Gomez shouted as he entered the room. The entire room was an altar, with a transparent blue crystal ball placed at its center. The crystal reacted to Gomez’s voice and began to glow.

Lights like stars floated within the crystal. The multiple lights were gold, silver, copper, and white. The intensity and blinking speed of the lights varied.

<b>

“……Silver, silver, this one’s gold……white, prey! But it’s small fry. Poachers, huh……oh, a big copper! Alright, let’s make this our prey! The expiration is close. This is just right.”

<b>

With the terrain of the land, this seems to be a ship radar. Moreover, considering the previous statements, it seems to be linked to the type of permits, expiration dates, and the size of the ship.

That means the densely glowing area is probably the port of Veraldo. It looks like I won’t get lost at sea after all……

<b>

Could this crystal ball be the divine artifact ‘Poseidon’? While information is indeed an important weapon, I can’t believe it’s enough to say ‘invincible at sea.’

<b>

“O great god of the sea! We shall hunt down this scoundrel! Guide us to our enemy!”

<b>

Oh, I sense the ship changing direction. Is this automatic movement?

I see, it’s not just a single function. It seems there are other functions as well. Well, it doesn’t matter. I’ll make sure I can retrieve it at any time.

<b>

“……Estimated arrival in about three hours. Alright, you guys, get ready for work! I’m going to take a little break!”

“Boss, what about the women?”

“Do as you like――wait. No breaking them since we’ll exchange them for money. Don’t go overboard before the battle.”

“Hehe, I’ll just pamper the pets a bit.”

<b>

Women. Pets, huh. Alright, alright, information is steadily gathering.

Now, I think I’ll follow this one.

<b>

I knocked out the lackey who guided me earlier as soon as he entered the room, but inside the room were three women in tattered clothes, bound. Hmm, it’s not the time to be thinking about how lewd this is.

All of them had lost the light in their eyes, and the room smelled foul. Seriously, clean this place up. Ugh. The scavenger slime is trying to clean up, but it seems to be falling behind.

<b>

“Ugh, half too late? Hey, is anyone okay? I came to help!”

<b>

As I called out while pushing aside the slime, one person reacted slightly.

<b>

“U……h? H-help?”

“Is there an elf sister here? Or someone who knows where she is?”

<b>

However, there were no silver hair or elf ears in sight. Just two humans and a beastwoman.

Hmm, it seems there are no elves in this room at least.

<b>

“……Who are you?”

“Hey, ladies, do you not know any elves? Oh, do you like scallops?”

<b>

I offered some butter-grilled scallops, and the ladies weakly raised their arms to take them, eating while shedding tears. The two who didn’t react at first did the same.

Alright. If they have the energy to eat scallops, they should be okay.

<b>

“Thank you……I feel like a human again for the first time in a while.”

“That’s good to hear. So, do you have any information on the elf girl?”

“……I’m not sure if it’s the one you’re looking for, but I heard they caught an elf about three days ago. They said they were going to sell her, so she might have already been sold.”

“She’s a beautiful elf, right? They wouldn’t just keep her, would they?”

“Probably fetched a pretty high price.”

<b>

If she was an unused elf, it would naturally sell for a higher price in that state.

If they’re going to sell her, they can’t use her themselves to maintain her unused status.

<b>

“……If they can’t use her themselves, it’s better to sell her quickly. It’s too much of a temptation.”

<b>

That’s quite true.

<b>

“Sigh, then there’s nothing we can do. I’ll help you ladies instead.”

“……Thank you. I appreciate the sentiment, but we can’t. We’d just be a burden.”

“Hmm?”

<b>

At that moment, I noticed something strange. The feet of the bound women――they were missing from the ankles down. I caught sight of burned wounds peeking from the crudely wrapped bandages. Both legs were like that.

<b>

“With these feet, well…”

“Ah……is this some kind of anti-escape measure?”

<b>

If they cut off the feet, they can’t escape. It also makes it easier to confine them in the room as they weaken.

<b>

Wait a minute?

Could this be what they meant by “treatment”!? Don’t mess with me!

<b>

<b>

Without feet, they can’t wear socks!!!

<b>

<b>

“Ah……this is definitely going to make the gods furious……ugh.”

“With this, even if we survive, we’ll just be ornaments.”

<b>

But this is an otherworld, huh? If it’s recovery magic or potions, they should be able to heal such injuries and losses, right?

Basic knowledge says that holy magic can heal missing limbs.……Holy magic, huh, I can vividly imagine the scene of that god healing feet for socks.

<b>

If one foot was left, it would have been easy to deal with……but now I have to create them from scratch with cell copying.

<b>

“Just leave us behind.……I was happy to be treated like a person at the end.”

“Haah……well, fine. I’ll heal you and give you your feet back.”

<b>

As I said this, I activated spatial magic. It’s not exactly a piece of cake, but first, I copied the cells, bones, blood vessels, nerves, etc., based on the right feet of the three. Then, I shaped them into feet by increasing and decreasing the cells.

Once I finished making their right feet, I used reverse copying to create their left feet and pasted them. Copied and flattened. Done—yay, applause!

If it were recovery magic, it would be a one-shot deal……spatial magic is versatile, but it requires ingenuity to do things outside my specialty. Ugh, what a hassle.

<b>

“Alright, now you have both feet. Can you move?”

“Eh, ah, huh?”

<b>

The ladies, confused, started moving their toes. It seems there’s no problem.

Since their hands evolved from front legs, modifying them into feet shouldn’t be a big issue. If it’s their own cells, there shouldn’t be any rejection……actually, in the tutorial, I was playing around by swapping an old man’s hand for a foot.

<b>

……Whoa, I felt a bit dizzy.

Maybe copying and shaping all three at once used too much magic power.

<b>

“Well, in any case, since I healed you, I’ll take my reward. For the socks—no, wait.”

<b>

At that moment, I suddenly realized something.

I just copied the ladies’ feet, right? With spatial magic.

<b>

If I copied the material for the socks, that would be a problem, but copying the feet themselves……wouldn’t that make me outside the god’s preferences?

<b>

“……I messed up!”

“Eh, what did you? The treatment?”

“That part is perfect, I swear to the gods. It’s just a personal matter, yeah.”

<b>

I held my head in my hands.

I was hoping to use the fact that I healed their feet to get regular sock production from now on!
