# Infiltrate a pirate ship!

<blank>

My name is Karina. I was sent off by a cute little elf girl named Dia (impromptu) and I infiltrated a pirate ship to save her sister!

I'll use optical camouflage to sneak inside the ship!　And since there seems to be some sacred artifacts, I'm going to snatch them too!

<blank>

<blank>

So, we sneak into the Kaito Carina Splendid. I'm a little excited because I've never seen such a big wooden ship in person before.

<blank>

Since we don't have any guesses, let's start with following behind Gomez.

...... Hey, I didn't have to leave the storage space for this, did I?　Oh well. If I go back now, I'm going to get the cold shoulder from Mr. Dear, so I'll just keep going. It's like sticking to the ceiling, ninja style.

<blank>

'Damn it, anyway, if I don't stock up soon, I'm doomed!　Because of that woman!　We already got the money!

How can I help you?

First, we'll look for prey!　If the permit is up to copper, let's just pretend it expired and go for it!"

What would the lord of the stone say if I did that?

Shut up!　Shut up, they won't know if you don't tell them!　We'll make it all up later!"

<blank>

Gomez tiptoes toward the center section of the ship.

There was a door there, a little more ornately decorated than the others. At a glance, one could tell that it was a room of great importance.

<blank>

Poseidon!　Great God of the seas!　Tell me the position of the rude one who crosses over it!"

<blank>

Gomez shouted as he entered the room. The entire room was an altar with a crystal ball in the center. The crystal glowed in response to Gomez's voice.

Lights float like stars in the crystal. Multiple floating lights are white to gold, silver, and copper. The lights vary in intensity and blinking speed.

<blank>

"...... silver, silver, this is gold ...... white, prey!　But a small one. Poaching. ...... Oh, it's a big copper!　Okay, let's take this one as our catch!　It's about to expire. Just in time."

<blank>

There is also the land terrain, which is apparently ship radar. That, combined with the previous statement, seems to be linked to the type and expiration date of the permit and the size of the vessel.

So the densely lit area is the port of Velarde? This would be a good place to not get lost at sea. ......

<blank>

Is this crystal ball the divine weapon "Poseidon"?　It is true that information is an important weapon, but I don't think this alone is enough to make us 'invincible on the sea'.

<blank>

Great God of the sea, we will hunt this infidel!　Let us hunt this infidel!　Lead us to our enemy!"

<blank>

Oops, a sign that the ship has turned around. Is this an automatic move?

Okay, so it's not just one function. I guess there are other functions when it comes to this. Well, it doesn't matter. I'll be ready to retrieve it anytime.

<blank>

"...... arrival is in an estimated 3 hours. O.K., you guys, get ready for work!　I'm taking some rest!"

What about the women, sir?

Do what you want. I'll give you money for it, so don't destroy it. Don't overdo it before the war."

"Heh, I'll just pet it."

<blank>

Woman. A pet. Well, well, well, well, well.

So, now I'll follow this guy.

<blank>

Mishita, who was shown the way one step ahead of me, beat me up and knocked me out when I entered the room, and there were three women in the room, wearing tattered clothes and tied together. Hmmm, this is not the time to say eh .......

All of them have lost the light from their eyes, and there is a fishy smell in the air. I mean, the room stinks. You should wash it. Moo. It's like the scavenger slime is hanging around, but it's not enough to keep up with the cleaning.

<blank>

"Hmmm, too late by half?　Hey, who's feeling better?　I'm here to help."

<blank>

When I called out to them while removing the slime, one of them reacted with a jerk.

<blank>

"U......A?　Tasus, ke?"

"Is your elf sister here?　Or does anyone know where she is?"

<blank>

But I don't see any silver hair or elf ears. It's two humans and their beastly sister.

Hmmm, at least not in this room, Mr. Elf.

<blank>

"...... you, are you ......?"

Hey, sisters, have you ever heard of elves?　Oh, do you want some scallops or something?"

<blank>

When I held out and approached the buttered scallops, each of the sisters weakly raised their arms to accept them and ate them with tears in their eyes. Even the two who did not react first.

Yeah, I think I'll be fine if I have the energy to eat scallops. If you have the energy to eat scallops, you'll be fine.

<blank>

Thank you ...... for making me feel more human than I have in a long time."

That's fine. So, do you have any information on the elven children?"

I don't know if it's the ...... searcher, but he said he caught the elf about three days ago, I think. But he said he was going to sell it off, and I think it's already been sold."

"You're a beautiful elf, you know?　You wouldn't keep her on hand, would you?"

You must have gotten a very high price."

<blank>

If it was an unused elf, it would naturally sell for more if it remained unused.

If I sell it, I can't use it myself to keep it unused.

<blank>

"......If you can't use it yourself, you'd better sell it quickly. It's a real eye sore."

<blank>

You are absolutely right.

<blank>

'Ah, well, I don't have a choice. I'll help your sisters out instead."

Thanks for the "....... I appreciate the sentiment, but we can't do it. We're slowing you down."

Hmm?"

<blank>

And then, I noticed something strange. The legs of the women who were tied together - from the ankles down - were missing. I could see burnt wounds from the bandages that had been roughly spread around. Each of them had wounds on both legs.

<blank>

"With these legs, you know. ......

Uh, ......, the breakout-prohibitive kind."

<blank>

If you cut off their legs, they can't escape. It weakens them and makes it easier to lock them in a room.

<blank>

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Don't tell me this is a 'procedure'!　You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

<blank>

You can't wear socks without feet!

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh ......, this is sure to make God very angry. ...... Oh my God."

I'll be nothing more than an ornament if I make it back alive."

<blank>

But it's a different world, isn't it? Maybe restorative magic or magic potions can heal these defects and wounds, right?

Mr. Basic Knowledge has some info on how sacred magic can heal missing limbs. ...... holy-magic is what it is... I can just picture that god healing a foot for a sock.

<blank>

If one leg was still there, it would have been easy to deal with it. ...... but with this one, you'd have to sculpt it from scratch with a cellular copy.

<blank>

'Please leave us alone. It was nice to be treated like a person at the end of my ...... life."

'Hah ...... well, that's okay. I'll fix your leg while I'm helping you."

<blank>

As he says this, he deploys spatial magic. A little bit, not so much as to say a little bit, but first, cells, bones, blood vessels, nerves, etc., are copied based on the right hands of the three people. Later, the cells are increased or decreased to form the shape of a foot.

When you finish making the right leg of each, invert copy to make the left leg, then overwrite and paste. Copy and paste. Finished - wow, crackle, crackle, crackle.

I guess recovery magic would be a shot in the arm. ...... Space magic is versatile, but it takes some ingenuity to do something outside of your expertise. Woo, that was tedious.

<blank>

Yes, now you have both legs. Can you move?"

What, uh, what?"

<blank>

The sisters are puzzled and moving their toes. They seem to have no problem.

Hands are evolved from paws, so there is no problem to process them into legs. If it's his own cells, there would be no rejection. ...... In fact, in the tutorial, I played around with replacing the old man's hand with a foot, so God.

<blank>

...... Ugh, I'm flustered.

Maybe I used a little too much magic to copy and mold three people at the same time.

<blank>

'Well, whatever it is, I fixed it, so I'll take the reward. With a sock--no, wait."

<blank>

Here I suddenly realized something.

I just copied these sisters' legs, right? With spatial magic.

<blank>

You can't even copy the material of a sock, but if the foot itself is copied, it would be out of God's sexuality at ......, wouldn't it?

<blank>

"I missed ......!"

What?　Treatment?"

'That one's perfect, I swear to God. It's a little personal, yeah."

<blank>

I held my head up.

I was planning to have them mass-produce socks on a regular basis in the future, using the fact that I had healed my foot as an excuse!
