# Huh? Why?

<b>

So, from our perspective, we've already done what we needed to do and resolved the issue, but—

<b>

“—So, what about the other demon tribe women?”

<b>

Yōki-chan interrogates the merchants in shabby clothes—now turned into former merchants with no money.

<b>

“...They've already been sold off.”

“We didn’t keep any records of them...”

“Try to remember as much as you can! I’ll feed you to the dragon!?”

“E-eek!!”

<b>

It seems that everyone except the latest one has already been sold and cannot be tracked down.

The symbolic horns have also been completely shaved off, making them look like slaves not much different from humans. It seems finding them will be quite difficult.

Thus, the conversation regarding the demon tribe is not yet over.

<b>

“Hey, what do you think you’re doing deciding my menu on your own? Do you want me to bite you? Huh?”

“Look! The dragon is motivated too, so spit it out quickly!”

“No, it’s you who should be—”

<b>

By the way, I have Kirigon accompanying me. I only told him to sit around, and I didn’t say anything about following Yōki-chan’s orders.

And Kirigon has no particular intention of cooperating with Yōki-chan, but just being there and making noise makes the former merchants' mouths slippery, as if they had been enchanted with floating magic.

<b>

“A, that’s a major slave trader from the Empire! If we inquire, we might be able to track them down!”

“If you kill us here, you won’t be able to track them down!? Is that okay!?”

“There are two of us, and one of us is not really… you know?”

“Should I bite three of you? Huh?”

“I-I’ll talk, just spare my life!”

“I have five wives and seven children…!”

“Fufufu, with the dragon’s cooperation, the interrogation goes smoothly!”

“...Damn it, this is hard...!! Hey, sis! Can you say something to this guy!? We can’t communicate here!”

<b>

Kirigon is saying something, but I pretended not to hear.

Because it’s normal for us not to understand each other.

<b>

And right now, I’m decorating Dia-kun and Galldra’s claws.

Making the girl cute is more important than listening to that guy’s complaints, right? That’s how it is.

<b>

“Dia-kun-chan, your sense is great! It’s way cuter than what Karina would do!”

“Um, is this making her happy?”

“...Yeah, she’s really happy.”

<b>

This is strange. I should have been closer to Galldra first...!

Even though I decorated Galldra’s claws with jewels, she says Dia-kun’s is better...!!

<b>

“By the way, Galldra, does that mean you thought my work was just a game!?”

“Ah, well, the idea is Karina’s, but the sense is a different matter, right? Dia-kun-chan’s sense is outstanding, right? Karina is just filling in the gaps, right?”

<b>

Ugh!! It’s true that Dia-kun’s doesn’t have any unnecessary stones attached and is decorated with larger jewels like a crest.

It has a certain elegance like a piece of jewelry, but still!

<b>

Isn’t it that girls like decorations that look like pixel art with Swarovski beads all over them!? Look how shiny they are!!

<b>

“Well, I guess some people just like different things, right? It’s just not my taste.”

“They were well-received by the Five Great Elders... They said if each jewel had a spell attached, it could be a huge number... I wonder what would happen if I drew a magic circle with this...”

“Those people have a craftsman’s perspective. They make jewelry too, so they have that kind of sense, but as a general trend among dwarves, performance is prioritized over design…”

<b>

Does that mean elves excel in aesthetic sense!?

Wow, what a revelation. Dia-kun is a genius...!

<b>

“...”

<b>

Ah, Yōki-chan is looking over here. Do you want to be decorated too?

I thought that, but she didn’t even glance at the stones and instead spoke to us.

<b>

“Um, could you help us rescue everyone who was sold?”

“Eh? Why?”

<b>

Oh no, I accidentally replied normally without thinking.

But I’m a merchant, you know? I won’t help unless I feel like it if there’s no benefit.
