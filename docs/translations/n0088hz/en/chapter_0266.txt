# What?　Why?

<blank>

So, from our point of view, we've done what we had to do, and we've solved the problem.

<blank>

"--and what about the other women of the demon tribe?"

<blank>

Yoki interrogates the poorly dressed merchants - former merchants, since they were left penniless.

<blank>

I've already sold out of ......."

I didn't even keep a record of every single one of them. ......

Remember as much as you can!　I'll feed you to the dragons!

Hi, hi!

<blank>

Apparently, all but the newest one has already been sold and cannot be tracked down.

The symbolic horns have been cut off, and the slaves are not so different from human beings in appearance. It seems to be very difficult to find them.

As such, this is not the end of the story in terms of the demon tribe's village.

<blank>

What are you doing deciding my menu? You want me to take a bite?　What?

Look!　The dragon is willing to do it, spit it out racy!"

No, I'm talking about you.

<blank>

He also has Kirigon as an escort. I just told him to sit around there, I didn't tell him to listen to Yohki's orders or anything.

And Kirigon has no particular intention of cooperating with Yoki-chan, either, but just being there and squealing makes the former merchants' mouths lighten as if they were slipping on slime and casting a levitation spell.

<blank>

"Oh, that's a major slaver in the Empire!　And, and, and, and, and if we inquire, we might be able to track him down!"

'Wow, you can't go after us if you kill us here!　Are you sure about that?

There are two of us, and one of us is separately ...... hey?"

'Shall I take three bites?　Oh?

I will speak, but only for my life!"

Wow, I have five wives and seven children ......!"

With the help of Mr. Dragon, the interrogation goes smoothly!

'...... Damn, that's hard to do ......!　Hey, Miss!　Please say something to this guy!　I can't understand a word you're saying!

<blank>

Kirigon was saying something, but I pretended not to hear.

Because it's normal to not be able to communicate in the language.

<blank>

And I am now decking the nails of Mr. Deere and Galdra.

It's more important to make the girl pretty than to bitch about the bastard, right?　That's what I mean.

<blank>

I'm sure you have good taste, Dia-kun-chan-sama!　You are so much prettier than Karina!

'Sister, is this pleasing to you?'

......Yeah, I'm super happy about it."

<blank>

Funny. I would have been friends with Galdra first. ......

I tried to decorate Galdra's nails with gems, but Galdra says Dear you're better ......!

<blank>

I mean, Galdra, better than me, was that thing with me just for fun!"

'Well, I have an idea, Kalina, but not your sense of style?　Is it that Dia-kun-chan has a great sense of style?　Is Kalina just filling in the gaps?

<blank>

Ugh!　Indeed, Dia's has no extra stones attached to it, and the wire is decorated around a larger gemstone as if it were a coat of arms.

It already has the elegance of an ornate carving, though!

<blank>

I think gals like to decorate with Swarovski beads like dots on the surface!　Look, it's so shiny!

<blank>

I'm sure people who like it will like it.　It's just that I don't like it.

I was told that if I gave each gemstone a ...... number, I could get a great number of them, and I wondered what would happen if I drew a magic circle with it.

They are craftsmen from the point of view of a craftsman. They also make jewelry, so they have a sense for that kind of thing, but the overall trend among dwarves is performance over design. ......

<blank>

On the other hand, elves have a great sense of aesthetics, you mean!

Oh, my God. Dear you are a genius. ......

<blank>

"......"

<blank>

Oh, Yohki is looking at me. Do you want me to decock the chimi, too?

But he didn't pay attention to the stone and started talking to us.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to do. "Oh, um, could you please help me save the people who were sold?"

What?　Why?"

<blank>

Oops, I just unintentionally responded in a normal, straightforward way.

But I'm a merchant, remember?　I won't help you if I don't feel like it, if I don't benefit you in any way.
