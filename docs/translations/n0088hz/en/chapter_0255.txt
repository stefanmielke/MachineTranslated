# Farce

<blank>

<blank>

So we were relaxing and having tea in the ritual hall when suddenly it became noisy.

<blank>

"Mi, mi, mi, miko hime-sama!　A dragon has appeared!

Oh. Did he come?　The black one?"

How do you know that if you haven't seen it?　I mean, how do you know that if you haven't seen it?"

<blank>

Yoki nods her head.

<blank>

'Well, I've previewed it and I know.

"!　Don't tell me you were followed?"

'Ah. ...... maybe?"

Oh, my God, what have you done to me!

<blank>

Yoki-chan grabs my collar and shakes it. I'm so drunk.

<blank>

'Calm down. It's okay, we have the Princess!"

'Ha, yes it was!　Please, miko princess, calm the dragon!"

"...... sister, shall we go?"

"All right. Come on, have a hand."

<blank>

I will take Dear's hand and escort him. In addition, I will take Arthur with me.

The dragon seemed to be watching the situation while hovering above the ritual hall in a disciplined manner.

<blank>

I'm here for a farce, Miss!　I'm here to make a farce!　Miss ahhhhhhhh!

Heeey!　The dragon is very angry!　It's your fault, I swear!"

Oh, not so much.

I didn't mean it as a compliment!

<blank>

To Yoki, who doesn't understand dragon language, no matter how you hear it, it's nothing but the roar of a dragon. Okay, okay, I'm not afraid!

<blank>

I'm sure it's a black dragon, Miss. It's definitely strong, isn't it?　But still, just one punch?

It is."

'Oh, Miss!　Hmm?　What's with the Thunder Dragon? ...... Well, you too, Miss ......?"

<blank>

Kirigon comes down to the garden of the ritual hall, flapping his wings.

Arthur and Kirigon looked at each other, communicated for a moment, then looked at each other like they were in trouble, both of them.

<blank>

And Yohki is sitting down when Kirigon, the Black Dragon, comes down to the yard. He doesn't seem to be shitting himself.

<blank>

Come on, Dear!　It's the Black Dragon!"

Oh!　Is that girl over there your girlfriend?　Yes!　Kirigon, I'll show you my belly and let you rummage around!　Please!

<blank>

The huge body of the Black Dragon lying on its side!　and the huge body of the black dragon lying down.

　and the squeal sounded louder.

<blank>

'Wow, even the black dragons show their bellies in obedience before the princess! ...... Come on, pet her, Dear?"

"......What the hell did you do, sister ......?"

<blank>

Saying this in a somewhat dismayed tone, Dia-kun pats the black dragon's defenseless belly, which is armored enough to repel a lazy sword or an axe.

<blank>

I'm used to petting dragons!　You're used to petting dragons. ......　Technician ......

Oh, I knew you'd like it here."

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Miss, this girl's in trouble!　Oh, such a reverse scale crunching!　I'm sorry honey ......!

<blank>

Kirigon shakes his body pleasantly.

<blank>

Seeing this, Yohki and the other members of the demon tribe,

<blank>

"...... Oh, ...... taming the dragon!"

That's my miko-sama!"

The dragon jumped in to be petted himself!　That's the maiden beloved by dragons!"

<blank>

I was very impressed. You did it, right on target.
