# Farce

<b>

<b>

So, I was leisurely having tea in the ritual hall when it suddenly became noisy.

<b>

“M-m-m-miko princess! A d-d-d-dragon has appeared!”

“Oh. Did it come? The black one?”

“Yes! But how do you know without seeing it?”

<b>

Youki-chan tilts her head.

<b>

“Well, I saw it during a preliminary visit, so I know.”

“!! Could it be that you were being followed?!”

“Ah—... that might be the case?”

“W-what have you done to us!!!”

<b>

Youki-chan grabs my collar and shakes me back and forth. Oh no, I’m getting dizzy.

<b>

“Calm down. It’s okay, we have the princess with us!”

“Ah, that’s right! Please, miko princess, calm the dragon for us!!”

“...Shall I go, big sister?”

“Okay. Now, please take my hand.”

<b>

I take Dia-kun's hand and escort him. I might as well take Arthur along too.

The dragon seemed to be hovering above the ritual hall, observing the situation.

<b>

“Hey, sis! I’ve come for the farce!! Is this the right place?! Sis!!”

“Eek! The dragon is really angry! It’s definitely your fault!”

“Not really, it’s not that bad.”

“I’m not complimenting you!?”

<b>

To Youki-chan, who doesn’t understand dragon language, it must sound like nothing but the dragon’s roar. It’s okay, it’s not scary.

<b>

“Wow, isn’t that a black dragon, sis? It’s definitely strong, right? But can it be taken down with one hit?”

“Yep.”

“Oh, sis! Huh? There’s a thunder dragon too... I see, so you’re also with sis...?”

<b>

Kiligon descends into the garden of the ritual hall while flapping its wings.

Arthur and Kiligon exchange glances, momentarily understanding each other, both looking at each other with expressions of shared hardship.

<b>

And at the moment Kiligon, the black dragon, lands in the garden, Youki-chan has fainted. It seems she didn’t wet herself.

<b>

“Now, Dia-kun! It’s a black dragon!”

“Oh! Is that girl your favorite, sis? Yo! Kiligon, show your belly and let me rub it!! Go ahead!!”

<b>

With a thud, the massive body of the black dragon lies down.

Gyaoooon! Its roar echoed loudly.

<b>

“Wow, even the black dragon shows its belly in submission before the princess! …Come on, pet it, Dia-kun?”

“...What on earth did you do, big sister...”

<b>

Saying that with a somewhat exasperated tone, Dia-kun pets the black dragon’s defenseless—though its armor is enough to deflect a normal dull sword or axe—belly.

<b>

“Oof! You’re used to petting dragons...! Technician...”

“Oh, so this is the spot you like.”

“Ah, ah, ah, oh no, ah, sis! This kid is amazing!? Ah, don’t scratch that reverse scale! I’m sorry, honey...!”

<b>

Kiligon trembles with pleasure, shaking its body.

<b>

Seeing this, Youki-chan and the other oni tribe members are,

<b>

“...Oh, you’re taming the dragon...!”

“As expected of the miko princess!”

“The dragon jumped in to be petted! Truly, the miko loved by dragons!”

<b>

They were very moved. Yay, just as planned.
