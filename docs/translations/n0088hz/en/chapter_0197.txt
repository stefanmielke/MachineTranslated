# Talk to Mr. Deere as soon as possible.

<blank>

<blank>

So I thought I'd ask Deere to participate in the competition."

<blank>

I joined him at the base from the inn - and immediately consulted with Mr. Dear.

<blank>

"...... but I'm not a fighter?"

If it's a party fight, I can support you, Deere, and we've had competitions like this."

<blank>

and show them a reproduction of a flyer that was posted on the guild's bulletin board.

<blank>

Is the tamer convention ......?"

Yes," he said!　If you have Deere and Arthur go out in pairs, Deere will say to Arthur, 'I got it!　Arthur! and you can make a fortune!

"Oh, is that you?"

<blank>

Hearing his name called, Arthur came popping in.

<blank>

Certainly, Arthur will be as good as any squire out there."

Of course!　I'm the Thunder Dragon!

<blank>

Arthur proudly beats his chest while conversing with his vocabulary book.

<blank>

And just in case, it would be perfect if she wears that gothic lolita dress I had made for her at the Five Elder Workshop.

I don't think that's a good piece of equipment to show off.

But I can't replace your safety, Deere. I don't have a choice, do I? ...... Don't worry, don't worry, I'll stop you if it comes to it!"

<blank>

Gothic Lolita dress made by Godai Old Studio.

Magic is generally blocked, and physical attacks are reduced to the point where a full swing of the hammer can be stroked with a catnip. In addition, Dia-kun's attacks are strengthened to the point where a finger can pierce a rock with a deco-pin.

<blank>

However!　If you wear this and go wild, you will have tremendous muscle pain the next day!

<blank>

"...... disadvantages it's just too much of an enhancement. What's going on with that thing?"

They say it's a nice combination of curses to neutralize them."

<blank>

For example, the disadvantages of "becoming extremely violent" and "extreme suppression of violence" are balanced to be expressed at the same time and set to +/- 0. The result is a super equipment packed with a large number of such things.

<blank>

It's just that it's so exquisitely balanced that if even one ...... frill comes off, it disintegrates and explodes or something."

I knew you couldn't show this equipment!

It's okay!　It seems that the person who is equipped with the equipment does not suffer any damage even if it explodes!　The last fart of the equipment, so to speak?　It's more of a safety device.

<blank>

A device that ensures safety by eliminating enemies within a one-kilometer radius with an explosion. Safety device for short!

And it is a safety device, even in the proper sense of the word, that is dismounted before it lacks balance and incurs some disadvantage.

<blank>

The more I hear about ......, the more outrageous the equipment sounds."

The "Five Old Men's Factory" was the only one that could make such a thing, they boasted. I'd like to see Deer fighting in one of those. ...... is a good idea?"

My muscles hurt like hell.

That too can be cured with Roux's potion, right? That's why it's the last demerit effect left.

<blank>

Even that is left on a dare in case the equipment is taken and misused.

So after one rampage, you are stuck with sore muscles.

<blank>

The idea is that if you go wild, your location will become clear, and when you get there, you'll find your enemy lying there, stuck.

The equipment is truly lean and a work of art.

<blank>

...... and because it is actually tuned only for Deere-kun, even though it makes you think it is, if anyone other than Deere-kun wears it, it will be unbalanced and disadvantageous.

It is an equipment only for Dia-kun from the beginning. It is also exclusive to Dia-kun now, and when he grows up, even Dia-kun will have more disadvantages.

(According to him, "It's an elf, so it will last long enough, right?　I took the plunge and made it!" (According to him, "It's an elf, so it should last long enough.)

<blank>

So there's nothing you can do if they steal from you from the start. It left me with sore muscles for nothing.

I guess it's not a waste of time, because ...... you would be cute, Deere, writhing in muscle pain!

<blank>

'And you should wear it because you have to now! It's also ...... your rent to dress cute, Dear!"

"...... Moo, I can't help it. It's an excellent piece of equipment, and it's just this once, okay?"

Yay!"

<blank>

You can see Dia dress up in an official setting!

Heh heh, this is the start of the strongest story of the beautiful girl elf tamer. ......

<blank>

But I don't want to be the only one dressed like that, so please dress up, too.

Huh?"

I'll ask the Five Elders to make the most adorable outfits for you. Don't worry, when it comes to sister Karina's equipment, they can make it in one night.

<blank>

So we both dressed up and decided to compete in the Colosseum.
