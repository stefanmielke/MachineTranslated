# Consultation with Dia-kun Right Away

<b>

<b>

"So, I was thinking of having Dia-kun participate in the tournament too."

<b>

Having joined from the base at the inn, I immediately consulted with Dia-kun.

<b>

"But I don't have any combat power, you know?"

"In a party battle, I can support you, Dia-kun, and there’s this tournament too."

<b>

I showed him a copy of the flyer that was posted on the guild's bulletin board.

<b>

"A Tamer Tournament... is it?"

"That's right! If you and Arthur team up, all you have to do is tell Arthur, 'Go for it, Arthur!' and you can rake in the rewards easily!"

"Huh, me?"

<b>

Hearing his name called, Arthur hopped over.

<b>

"Surely, Arthur wouldn't lose to any of the summoned creatures around, right?"

"Of course! I'm a Thunder Dragon, after all!!"

<b>

Arthur puffed out his chest proudly while conversing through the vocabulary list.

<b>

"And if you wear that Gothic Lolita dress made by the Five Great Elder Workshops just in case, it’ll be perfect!"

"I think that gear is not suitable for public display."

"But nothing is more important than Dia-kun's safety. It can't be helped, right? ...Don't worry, if it comes to that, I'll stop it!"

<b>

Gothic Lolita dress made by the Five Great Elder Workshops.

It deflects most magic and reduces physical damage to the level where a full swing of a hammer feels like being petted with a feather. Additionally, attacks from Dia-kun are enhanced to the point where a flick of a finger can pierce a rock.

<b>

However! If you wear this and go wild, you'll be hit with an incredible muscle ache the next day!

<b>

"...The drawbacks alone make it overly enhanced. What's going on with that thing?"

"They say they skillfully combined curses to neutralize each other."

<b>

For example, the drawbacks of 'becoming extremely violent' and 'extreme suppression of violence' are balanced to manifest simultaneously at ±0. It’s a super gear packed with such combinations.

<b>

"However, because of that, it’s finely balanced... and if even a single frill comes off, it’ll collapse and cause a massive explosion or something."

"Isn't that gear something you definitely can't show in public?!"

"Don't worry! It seems the wearer takes no damage even if it explodes! It's like the gear's last resort? Rather, it's a safety device."

<b>

A device that eliminates enemies within a one-kilometer radius through explosion to ensure safety. For short, a safety device!

And it also serves a proper purpose as a safety device to remove the gear before any imbalance causes some kind of drawback.

<b>

"...The more I hear about it, the more ridiculous that gear sounds."

"Everyone boasted that only the Five Great Elder Workshops could make something like this. I want to see Dia-kun fighting in that... is that bad?"

"You'll get an incredible muscle ache from it."

"But that can be cured with Ruu-chan's potions. That’s precisely why it’s the last remaining drawback effect."

<b>

Even that is intentionally left behind in case the gear is stolen and misused.

After going wild once, you’ll be unable to move due to muscle pain.

<b>

If you go wild, your location becomes clear, and when you go there, you’ll find the incapacitated enemies rolling around.

It’s truly a waste-free, artistic piece of equipment.

<b>

...Or so it seems, but in reality, it’s tuned specifically for Dia-kun, so if anyone else wears it, the balance will collapse and drawbacks will manifest.

From the start, it’s a piece of equipment exclusively for Dia-kun. Moreover, it’s tailored for the current Dia-kun, and as he grows, even he will face increasing drawbacks.

(According to them, "Since he's an elf, he can use it for a long time, right? So we went all out to make it!")

<b>

So even if it were stolen from the beginning, there’s nothing that can be done. The unnecessary muscle pain remains.

...But Dia-kun writhing in muscle pain would also be cute, so it’s not entirely a waste!!

<b>

"So, since you can only wear it now, you should wear it!! ...Dressing cute is part of your rent, Dia-kun!"

"...Fine, I guess. It doesn't change the fact that it's excellent gear, so just this once?"

"Yay!"

<b>

I get to see Dia-kun dressed up in an official setting!

Hehe, this is the beginning of the story of the strongest beautiful girl elf tamer...!

<b>

"But it feels a bit unfair for me to be the only one dressed like that, so please dress up too, Onee-san."

"Huh?"

"Let’s have the Five Great Elders make you an incredibly cute outfit. Don’t worry, those people can make it overnight when it comes to your gear."

<b>

So, we decided to dress up and participate in the tournament at the coliseum.
