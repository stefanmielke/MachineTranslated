# What kind of sacrificial offering to an evil god could it be?

<b>

I was asked by Youki-chan to help rescue the demon tribe that has already been sold.

However, to be honest, I have no obligation or duty to do so.

<b>

So, if I am going to help, I want to make sure I get a proper reward.

<b>

“... P-please! Think of it as helping me!”

“It's not like we're dying to help Youki-chan, you know? Us.”

<b>

When I said that, Youki-chan stammered.

<b>

“First of all, I want a reward, you know? Even our princess, who possesses an otherworldly cuteness, needs money to live. Isn't it unreasonable to expect us to work for free?”

“B-but, right now, we have food prepared in the village... Isn’t there some kind of debt of hospitality like one meal in exchange for another...?”

“Not at all. We’re lending out a dragon, so the debt is actually much bigger.”

<b>

Yes, Gyarudora and Kirigon, the two of them are peacefully lounging around here. They perfectly suppress the threat of real dragons.

If converted into monetary value, the accommodation fee would be negligible.

<b>

Moreover, it cannot be denied that we are a different kind of threat, but we can communicate, and as long as we are not harmed, we are docile—no, even if we are drugged, we remain docile, so it should be safe, right? Right?

<b>

“Still, even a chance encounter is a connection from a past life. As a special service, if you give me the socks of the village women—specifically, the ones that have been worn for a few days and have become smelly. If you give me those, I wouldn’t mind helping a little.”

“... Huh?”

<b>

Youki-chan blinked in surprise. Well, I understand. If someone suddenly offers to help in exchange for smelly, worn-out socks, it’s only natural to react that way.

<b>

“It’s nothing more than a sacrificial offering for a little ritual. Due to various complicated circumstances and procedures, it has become necessary to have ‘used, unwashed, smelly socks,’ preferably ‘ones filled with a sense of shame.’ That’s how it is.”

“W-wait, a sacrificial offering for a ritual??? W-well, I guess that means it has some magical significance. What kind of evil god are we offering this to...?”

<b>

This is the main god of this world. Probably. ...Right?

<b>

“W-well, if that’s okay... As the village chief, I will order the women to provide socks...”

“Seriously? Your approval rating is going to drop fast, new village chief.”

“If I manage to settle for socks instead of a normally high reward, it might actually go up...?”

<b>

That’s right. By the way, the former village chief, who was selling women through merchants, has retired, and Youki-chan has become the new village chief.

Although she is the daughter of the former village chief who messed up, she was originally raised to be the next village chief, and it seems she has some achievements in calling us.

... One could also say that she has been burdened with various responsibilities.

<b>

“It’s a promise. If it doesn’t work out, I won’t let Youki-chan go until she produces as many socks as there are villagers. I’ll also break your horns and add humiliation.”

“I-I will keep my promise! I won’t do anything like drugging you!”

<b>

Though slightly hesitant, Youki-chan said that.

You said it, right? Then I will cooperate.

<b>

“Okay, let’s secure the safety of the village first.”

“Eh? Is it about barriers or something?”

<b>

I snapped my fingers.

<b>

“Yes, that’s all good.”

“? Did you do something?”

“Yeah, I stored this entire area.”

“Eh? Stored?”

<b>

That’s right. Right now, the area where the village used to be is—now a gaping empty lot.

After that, I just need to have Gyarudora and Kirigon trample the site, and if I disguise it as a place where dragons rampaged and turned it into an empty lot, it would be perfect.

<b>

After that, if I store Gyarudora and the others as well, it’ll be safe, safe. Hehehe.

<b>

“By the way, should I go ahead and heal the horns of the demon girl who was a slave?”

“... Eh, can you do that?”

<b>

Well, if you’re going to give me socks for an entire village, it’s a cheap deal.

I think even the gods would say that. ...That god would definitely say it. Absolutely say it. 500% sure it would say it.
