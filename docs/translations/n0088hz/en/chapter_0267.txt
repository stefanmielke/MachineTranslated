# What kind of sacrifice to what kind of evil god is this?

<blank>

Yohki asked me to help rescue a demon tribe that had already been sold.

But, frankly speaking, there is no obligation or duty.

<blank>

Therefore, I am willing to be properly compensated if I help.

<blank>

"...... Oh, please!　Think you can help me!"

I'm not the one who wants to help you, okay?　We are."

<blank>

When I said that, Yohki clammed up.

<blank>

I want to be paid in the first place.　Even our princesses, with all their inhuman cuteness, have to pay to live, so why should we expect them to work for free?"

I'm sure the village is preparing a meal for you right now. ...... Is there any way you could do me the favor of a one night stay and one meal?

No, I don't have it. We are lending out our dragons, so the loan is rather large."

<blank>

Yes, Galdra and Kirigon, two of them, are peacefully lumbering around here. The threat of actual dragons is perfectly contained.

The cost of lodging would not even come close to the amount of money spent.

<blank>

But I can't deny the aspect that we are another threat, but we can talk to each other and if we are not harmed, we are quiet - no, we are quiet even if we are drugged, so we are safe, right?　Right?

<blank>

But, as the saying goes, "A meeting made in heaven is a meeting made in heaven. As a special service, I'll give you the socks of all the women in the village - even the ones that smelled bad after a few days of wearing them. If you give them to me, I will not hesitate to help you a little.

"...... yeah?"

<blank>

And Yohki blinks her eyes. Well, I understand. That's what happens when you suddenly get a handful of stinky, worn-out socks and tell them you'll help them out.

<blank>

It's a bit like a ritual sacrifice," he said. After all the complications and procedures, we needed some 'used, unwashed, smelly socks,' preferably with a lot of shame in them. That's about it."

Ritual sacrifices?　Well, well, I guess that means it has a proper magical meaning. I wonder what kind of evil god the sacrifice is to ......"

<blank>

He's the main god of this world. Maybe. It's ......, right?

<blank>

And anyway, if that's all right with you, as ...... village chief, I'll order the women to provide you with socks. ......

"Seriously? Looks like your approval rating is going to drop fast, Shinricho."

If you'd rather get paid in socks for what is essentially a hefty fee, you might go up. ......?"

<blank>

Yes. Incidentally, the village head who was selling women through merchants retired and Yohki became the new head.

Although she is the daughter of the village head who did the deed, she was originally raised as the next head of the village and apparently has the credit for calling us.

It could be said that ...... was forced to do a lot of things.

<blank>

I promise. If I don't make it, I'll lock you up and not return until you produce the same number of socks as the entire village. I'll break your horns and add to your humiliation."

"Oh, oh ...... and I will keep my word, I will. I won't even drug you!"

<blank>

She was a bit reserved, but said so.

You said it, right?　Then let's cooperate.

<blank>

Then let's secure the village first.

What?"　Warding or something?"

<blank>

I snap my fingers.

<blank>

"Yes, that's okay."

What did you do?　Did you do something?"

Yeah, I've got this whole area in storage."

What?"　Storage?"

<blank>

Yes, it is. The area where the village used to be is now - gutted and cleared.

Now all we need to do is to have the site overrun by Galdra and Kirigon and disguise it as a place where the dragons went on a rampage and cleared the land, or something like that, and it would be perfect.

<blank>

After that, the galdras will be safe and sound as long as they are stowed away. Hmmm.

<blank>

And, for the time being, should I heal the horns of the demon girl who was enslaved?"

......Eh, can you do that?"

<blank>

Well, if you can give me a sock for one village, it's a small price to pay.

I think even God would say that. ......That God would definitely say that. He would definitely say that...over 100%, 500%.
