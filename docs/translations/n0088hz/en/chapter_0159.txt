# Dear-kun is such a sinful woman...

<b>

"Ah, I feel a bit refreshed."

"Y-you really shot through the entire stock...?"

<b>

I shot through the stock with dual pistols. And at high speed.

A manual machine gun that fired 6 shots from each of the 2 guns in just one second.

Since the guns couldn't handle it, I had to get maintenance done midway. Of course, for free.

<b>

I understood the limits of the guns, and it was a good test fire!

<b>

"I'm back!"

"Welcome back, my lord."

"Oh, thank you for your hard work, sister."

<b>

Aishia and Dear-kun look somewhat tired.

I must have kept them waiting too long with all that test firing.

<b>

"So, what's up? You both look really tired."

"While the sister was test firing, I took a look around the village..."

"Dear-sama was quite popular..."

<b>

I see. Well, it's understandable since Dear-kun is cute.

If they make a move, I'll knock them out.

<b>

"They offered me mithril hair accessories and earth spider silk textiles, saying 'Would you like to drink with me?'..."

"It seemed like a serious proposal. Each item was quite a finely crafted piece."

<b>

For dwarves, it's common to propose by offering their best works.

Dear-kun is such a sinful woman... even though she's a boy.

<b>

"...So, you didn't accept, right?"

"What do you think I am, sister!? I turned them down!!"

<b>

I think she's a very cute elven boy. Yes.

<b>

<b>

"...While we're in this village, it might be better to bring Arthur-kun along. With a dragon, no bad bugs would dare approach."

'You mean me? I'm fine with that.'

"Sorry, please."

<b>

It must have been tough for Dear-kun to receive those advances from bearded men. She nodded obediently.

<b>

"It might also be good for a woman to start a conversation."

"Like a neighborhood gossip? That seems effective, though I don't really understand. Wouldn't Dear-kun end up being targeted by dwarf women instead?"

"From a female dwarf's perspective, I'm just a 'child without a beard,' so it's fine."

<b>

I see. I thought I might also procure some socks, so I decided to head towards Aishia and the gathering of dwarf women.

<b>

<b>

A gathering of women. It was the cooking area.

In a child-sized dwarf kitchen, dwarf women were bustling about preparing dinner.

At first glance, it looked just like a cooking class in elementary school!

<b>

"Wow, so cute...! But if you look closely, their knife skills are amazing!"

<b>

Chopping vegetables in an instant! It's not a slicer, it's a knife!?

And what about those decorative cuts? They're making something like Tanabata strips while chatting... they're skilled cooks!

<b>

"Well, they're dwarves. Compared to humans, everyone has nimble hands."

"I don't think I could replicate that without using spatial magic... wow, that's incredible."

<b>

The potato peels are in geometric patterns... oh, and they peeled them normally too. Was it just a playful pastime?

<b>

<b>

By the way, it seems that the village's meals are prepared here collectively.

This might also be a factor in considering the village as one big family.

<b>

"Oh? Aishia-chan. It's been a while. Are you still alive?"

"Ah. Yeah. It's been a while, grandma. I'm happily serving as this lord's slave. Didn't you hear from my dad?"

"Oh, right. He did mention there was a celebratory feast today. Is that it?"

<b>

A dwarf with red hair and brown skin, who, upon closer inspection, has fine wrinkles around her eyes.

...Is she a grandma with just fine wrinkles? She really looks young.
