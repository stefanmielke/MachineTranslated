# Deere, you are such a guilty bitch. ......

<blank>

Whew, that cleared things up a bit."

I didn't think they'd really shoot up the inventory. ......

<blank>

I shot all the bullets in my inventory with two guns. And it was a high speed continuous fire.

Manual machine gun that fires 6 rounds x 2 guns in 1 second.

The gun didn't hold up so I had maintenance done along the way. Free of charge, of course.

<blank>

It was a good test run, and I learned the limitations of the gun!

<blank>

I'm home."

"Welcome home, my Lord."

Oh, thank you for your help, sister."

<blank>

Aisia and Dia look tired.

I've made you wait too long to try and shoot.

<blank>

What's wrong? You look really tired."

I was allowed to watch the village while your ...... sister was doing a trial shoot."

"Dear Sir, I'm irresistible. ......"

<blank>

I see. Well, Deere, you're cute.

If he comes at me, I'll kick his ass.

<blank>

"He offered me mithril ore hair ornaments, earth spider silk fabrics, and other things and said, 'Have a drink with me.' ......

It was a very serious courtship," he said. They were all quite elaborate gems."

<blank>

In Dwarfish terms, it is common to propose by presenting your best work of art that you have created.

Dear you are such a guilty woman. ...... I'm a man's daughter.

<blank>

You didn't take it or anything at ......, did you?"

'What does your sister think I am!　I said no!"

<blank>

I think she's a very pretty elf boy girl. Yeah, I think she's a very pretty elf boy girl.

<blank>

<blank>

I think we should take Arthur with us while we're in this village. With a dragon with you, the bad bugs won't be attracted to him."

Is it you?　I don't mind.

Excuse me, please."

<blank>

It must have been indeed bearable to have the bearded men send autumn waves to him. Dia-kun nodded honestly.

<blank>

It might be a good idea to keep the conversation open on the women's end."

"Well, a well-wisher?　I don't know about you, but I'm wondering if the Dwarven woman is going to try to get to you this time."

"In the eyes of a female dwarf, she's 'a child without a beard,' so she'll be fine."

<blank>

I see. I decided to head to the hangout of the dwarf women with Isiah to see if we could get some socks while we were at it.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

A women's hangout. It was a cookhouse.

In a dwarf kitchen the size of a child from a human perspective, dwarf women were chattering and cooking dinner.

At first glance, it looks like an elementary school cooking class!

<blank>

Nnnn, it's so loli loli ......!　But if you look closely, you can see how she uses a knife!

<blank>

It's a moment, a moment, like slicing into strips!　It's not a slicer, it's a knife!

I mean, what's with that decoration cutter, he's a ...... skilled cook who's making something like Tanabata strips while chatting!

<blank>

They are dwarves. Compared to humans, they are all very good with their hands.

I don't think I could imitate that without using spatial magic. ...... Wow!"

<blank>

The skin of the potato has a geometric pattern ...... Oh, and I peeled it even more normally. You were just playing with your hands to pass the time.

<blank>

<blank>

Incidentally, the village's rice is made here in bulk.

These may be factors that contribute to the decision that the village is one home.

<blank>

Huh?　Isiah. I haven't seen you for a long time. Are you alive?

Oh. Oh, yeah. Long time no see, grandma. I'm happily working as a slave for my master here. Didn't Dad tell you?"

"Ah, well, you said there was a celebration party today. I wonder if that's it."

<blank>

Dwarf with red hair, brown color, and if you look closely, you will see small wrinkles around her eyes.

I'm a ...... grandmother and it's only a small wrinkle, you look really young.
