# Do you want to buy a weapon I made?

As for Aisia, I asked her not to participate in the drinking party.

You see, you see, Isiah is mine. By rights. Slave and master.

<blank>

I'm not going to let a slave get impregnated and not be able to work. You have to work hard, Isiah."

I'm loyal to you, even if Dad doesn't tell me to be."

You've always sang songs and never did any work at home. You know, Pastel.

I know," he said. Ai's sister has always been--"

Don't tell Aruji any more than that! ...... or rather, why is Pastel here?"

'Because I am now officially Father's third wife. You can call me Mother, okay?"

'Eh. My sister is your mother? ...... ugh, it's complicated."

<blank>

Hmmm, I'm curious about a lot of things. Like the sister being the mother.

...... that?　If you think of it as a normal human settlement, it's like a child of the same age became the third wife of the village head?　Isn't that an impossible story?

<blank>

In a manner of speaking, this boastful face seems to be a success story, a ball and chain.

<blank>

Apparently, what we mean by brothers and sisters and parents is quite different."

Yes, Dear, you're right. I'm getting a little confused.

I don't think you need to worry about it.　It's none of my business.

<blank>

As for the dwarven mindset, Arthur the dragon, you may be the smartest.

<blank>

You are very proficient in using a vocabulary book, Mr. Arthur. He is communicating with Mr. Dia by showing him the words accurately as he speaks.

Even if you don't have dragon language skills enabled, you can still have a normal conversation with a vocabulary book.

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, yes. "Oh, yes.

I don't have a lot of cash on me. Well, I don't have much cash."

You can pay me with a drink. Here, how about this?"

<blank>

After saying this, Mr. Rahman put down his gun with a thump.

And it was a revolver type. Wow, it's a cool silver gun. Is the grip wrapped in leather?

<blank>

I thought you said swords and shields!"

Even if you make such an old-fashioned thing, it won't sell that well. The sword that my grandfather made is still in use. ......

<blank>

Ah, that's what happens when you're a master craftsman.

And it is no wonder that dwarves, who love to make things, are not interested in items like guns.

<blank>

Guns are good for that. They cost a lot of bullets, but they can kill the enemy unilaterally. Even women and children can kill adventurers. As an adventurer, it's good to have a gun as a subweapon. It's perfect for self-defense.

<blank>

It is certainly not a bad option to have as a trump card in case of emergency.

The fact that the same attack power can be used by anyone means that it can be used even if the user is injured or fatigued and can no longer wield a sword.

<blank>

I'm sure it's not bad. I wonder if it would be a good piece of equipment for you, Deere?"

"...... I see, so the whole point is that it costs money for bullets, right?"

Oh, that's right. Did you notice that, Mr. Elf?"

<blank>

What do you mean, Dear?

<blank>

'...... sister, think of me as a merchant. Dwarf swords are good products that last a long time and require minimal care. That means that once you sell it, you don't earn much money after that. On the other hand, this one is a good product, and if you want to use it, you will inevitably need to pay for bullets. That means you can make money for a long time."

That's right. This one in particular requires bullets specially made to fit the gun. They are a bit pricey, but that's the way it is with Isiah. If you buy the gun, I'll give you a box of bullets.

<blank>

I actually hold it in my hand. A good grip that feels right at home. Good trigger weight.

Oh, this is a good one: ......!

<blank>

Yeah, it uses a magic circle to authenticate the individual. "Yes, we use magic circles to authenticate individuals. It's designed to be safe even if it's stolen by an enemy."

<blank>

What a great idea! No more accidents like kids accidentally shooting themselves. The guns of the earth should be based on this specification, even though it's not magic.

<blank>

So, what's the price I'm wondering?"

Three gold coins, or the equivalent in booze, will do."

I'll buy four guns. And give me one gold coin's worth of bullets."

<blank>

I quickly held out 13 gold coins.

You said you didn't have much cash. That was a lie.

<blank>

Well, I have 7 more gold coins to earn as a healer from the other day, so I can make a big party out of it!

I could buy just one gun and duplicate it, but I don't want to be a cheapskate against Isiah and Sati-tan's parents!

<blank>

...... Well, if you buy one gold coin's worth of bullets, it's not unnatural if you duplicate and use them and don't buy more, saying 'I still have plenty left over'.

<blank>

...... Isiah, your master is generous."

"Hmmm, isn't he the master of the world?"

We know he's a great merchant. This is a welcome banquet."

<blank>

Aisia proudly puffed out her chest. ...... No, I don't make any money as a merchant!
