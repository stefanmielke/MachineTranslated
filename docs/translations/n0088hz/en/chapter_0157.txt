# Are you going to buy the weapons I made?

<b>

Please refrain from inviting Aisia to the banquet.

You see, Aisia is mine, in terms of rights. It's a master and slave relationship.

<b>

"Well, I can't have a slave getting pregnant and unable to work on her own, can I? You better work hard, Aisia."

"I've already pledged my loyalty without you telling me, you know?"

"You've always just been singing and never did any of the household work, right? Hey, Pastel."

"That's right. Aisia has always—"

"More than that is a secret from the master! ...By the way, Pastel, why are you here?"

"I've officially become Father’s third wife. You can call me Mother now, okay?"

"Eh. My sister is my mother... ugh, that's complicated."

<b>

Hmm, there are many things I'm curious about. A sister being a mother, for instance.

...Is it like, if you think of it in terms of a normal human village, a child of the same age becoming the village chief's third wife? It doesn't seem impossible.

<b>

From that proud look on his face, it seems like a success story, a rise in status.

<b>

"It seems that our definitions of siblings and parents differ quite a bit, doesn't it?"

"That's right, Dia-kun. My head is getting tangled up."

'Isn't it fine not to worry about it? It doesn't concern me anyway.'

<b>

Arthur, the dragon, might be the smartest when it comes to the dwarves' way of thinking.

<b>

Still, Arthur is really making good use of the vocabulary book. He’s showing Dia-kun the words accurately while talking, effectively communicating.

Even without activating dragon language skills, it seems he can have a conversation just fine with the vocabulary book.

<b>

<b>

"Oh right. Karina-san, are you going to buy the weapons I made?"

"Oh, is that okay? Well, I don't have much cash on me."

"I'll accept alcohol as payment too. How about this?"

<b>

Saying that, Rahman placed a handgun down.

Moreover, it was a revolver. Wow, what a cool silver gun. Is the grip wrapped in leather?

<b>

"Wait, it's not a sword or shield!?"

"Making something so old-fashioned wouldn't sell well. My grandfather's sword is still in active use..."

<b>

Ah, it's because he's a master craftsman that such things happen.

And of course, a dwarf who loves making things would show interest in an item like a gun.

<b>

"Guns are good in that regard; they require ammunition, but you can kill enemies unilaterally. Even women and children can kill adventurers. For adventurers, having one as a secondary weapon is not a loss. It's perfect for self-defense."

<b>

Indeed, having it as a trump card in case of emergencies is not a bad option.

The fact that anyone can deal the same amount of damage means that even if you can't swing a sword due to injury or fatigue, you can still use it.

<b>

"That's certainly not bad. Would it be good for Dia-kun's equipment?"

"…I see, the fact that it requires ammunition is the key point, right?"

"Yes, exactly. You noticed, Elf-san."

<b>

Huh, what does that mean, Dia-kun?

<b>

"…Sister, think of it as a merchant. Dwarven swords last a long time and require minimal maintenance. In other words, once sold, there’s little income afterward. On the other hand, this item is of good quality, but using it inevitably requires ammunition. In other words, it can earn money for a long time."

"That's right. Especially this one requires special bullets tailored for the gun. It’s a bit pricey, but well, since it's Aisia's connection, if you buy the gun, I'll throw in a box of bullets for free."

<b>

I actually held it in my hand. It has a nice grip that fits well. The trigger weight is just right.

Oh, this is a good item...!

<b>

"Ah, I'll use a magic circle for personal authentication. It has a safety feature that prevents anyone other than the designated user from using it. It's designed to be safe even if it gets stolen by enemies."

<b>

What’s that? That’s amazing. Accidents like kids accidentally using it will be eliminated. Earth guns should take notes from this design, even if there’s no magic.

<b>

"So, what's the price?"

"Three gold coins, or equivalent in alcohol."

"I'll buy four. Also, give me bullets worth one gold coin."

<b>

I smoothly handed over thirteen gold coins.

I said I didn't have much cash. That was a lie.

<b>

Well, I still have seven more gold coins from my earnings as a healer the other day, so I can splurge a bit!

Buying just one and duplicating it is fine, but I don’t want to be stingy with Aisia and Sati-chan’s family!

<b>

...Well, if I buy bullets worth one gold coin, even if I duplicate and use them, I can say "there's still plenty left" and it wouldn't be unnatural not to buy more.

<b>

"…Aisia, your master is quite generous."

"Hehe, as expected of the master."

"I understand he's a skilled merchant. This calls for a welcome banquet."

<b>

Aisia puffed out her chest proudly. ...Well, she hasn't earned anything as a merchant at all, though!
