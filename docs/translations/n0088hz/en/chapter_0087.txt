# Unknown Store's CM Song

"Eh, is it okay to wear boys' clothes?"

"Yeah, because you don't like girls' clothes, right? You only need to indulge my whims about half the week."

"…It's not that I dislike it, you know? If it's your whim, then even more so… I actually want to fulfill it…"

<b>

It's not my current desire to have my sense of shame diminished.

<b>

"Well, considering the future, getting too used to girls' clothes probably isn't good. Yeah."

"…I see. Understood."

<b>

So, it was decided that Dia-kun would spend about half the week in boys' clothes.

Since the week is odd, one day can be spent in whichever outfit is preferred… Now, which will it be? This is Siesta's suggestion.

<b>

As expected of Siesta. Making someone choose is quite ruthless. This will also serve as a gauge for whether the current consciousness is that of a boy or a boy's daughter.

Once fully transitioned into a boy's daughter, another plan for shame awaits. A calculated act…!

<b>

<b>

At this moment, Aisia had a look of astonishment on her face.

<b>

"Eh… Dia-sama, you were a boy?"

"…I'm a boy. Didn't I mention that?"

"W-why are you so cute…!?"

<b>

Yeah. Why are you so cute?

<b>

"Why are you so cute!?"

"You don't need to say it twice…"

"Well, Dia-kun's gender is Dia-kun's. Boys aren't this cute, you know?"

"…Y-you're right… I-it's just so cute."

"What can I say? It's a bit unsatisfactory to be convinced like that."

<b>

So, Dia-kun would spend about half the week in boys' clothes.

In any case, she only looks like a girl in boy's clothes, so I have no problem with it.

I really want to check regularly if this is going well…

Currently operating the magical engine vehicle 'Star-kun No. 2' remotely from the storage space of spatial magic.

Not as a magical tool, but rather playing with it like a toy using spatial magic.

It's fun to zoom around.

<b>

Well, having eyewitness accounts and actual information on how long it takes to fly and arrive, the state of the vehicle's dirtiness and scratches, and such evidence is definitely better. Yeah.

<b>

As I was gazing out from the window above, I spotted a carriage being attacked by monsters in front of the magical engine vehicle 'Star-kun No. 2'. Goblins and orcs, the usual suspects. They were thinned out but still remained enough to attack people as they came out of the forest.

Should I take a detour…? No, I should help out here. It seems like a close fight.

<b>

<b>

I smoothly moved from the storage space to the driver's seat. Designating the magical engine vehicle 'Star-kun No. 2' as invincible. I veered slightly off the road and rammed into the goblins and orcs.

<b>

It's completely a traffic accident!

But in this world, there are no laws regulating collisions between magical engine vehicles and monsters!

<b>

"Yah-hoo! Excuse me, coming through!"

"Eh? Ah, th-thank you for the help—"

<b>

Leaving the voice of gratitude behind, I sped away. Alright, I managed to say something, so that should be enough. I returned to the storage space.

Wow, I really helped someone.

<b>

<b>

"Master, how about seafood soup for dinner today?"

"Oh, sounds good. It's really amazing that you can cook with that bard skill."

"It's an essential skill for traveling. Plus, it's easier to express myself when I make it myself. La la la, the bounty of the blue sea—packed full in this supreme dish—fragrant fennel and the scent of the tide—clam's texture—slices of kraken dancing in the mouth—flaky white fish swimming in the mouth—oh, everyone, let's eat the seafood soup from Aoyagi-tei~♪"

Singing an unknown store's CM song, Aisia took out ingredients from the refrigerator space (connected box).

The ingredients sourced from Sorashidore and Verarudo (used normally to a certain extent, and if they seem to run low, they are duplicated to replenish) are always fresh and available. Cooking should go smoothly.

<b>

While copying the finished product is nice, handmade cooking is something special.

In fact, I intend to avoid copying cooking as much as possible. I need to spend living expenses properly to keep the economy going. Thanks to Aisia, I never have to worry about meals!

<b>

Wow, Aisia is truly a find. If I were to get married, I’d definitely want someone who can cook… Wait, wait. The teachings of Senior Shildon, the teachings of Senior Shildon. Phew.

<b>

That was close. I almost got swayed by Aisia… Well, I definitely can't let her go free! There are too many secrets.

"Master. There are also cooking songs that sing about how to make local dishes."

"Oh, we had that in my hometown too. Was it croquettes…? The second verse was about napolitan, right? I only remember the first verse of the lyrics."
