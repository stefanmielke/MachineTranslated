# Commercial song for a restaurant I don't know

'What, am I allowed to wear men's clothes?'

'Yeah, because you don't like girls' clothes, do you?　I only need you to be selfish with me for half the week."

I'm not ...... averse to it, you know.　I mean, if it's your sister's selfishness, I'd rather ...... fulfill it. ......

<blank>

That would cut down on my sense of shame, which is not what I currently desire.

<blank>

'Well, it's not good to get too used to girls' clothes for the future, maybe. Yeah."

"...... yes, I see. Understood."

<blank>

Thus, Dia-kun was asked to spend half the week dressed as a boy.

Since the week is an odd number, we are allowed to dress up as whichever we want for one day. ...... Well, which will it be?　is the siesta's suggestion.

<blank>

Sue Sier. I'm so impressed that they let you make your own choice. I heard that this is also an indicator of whether the current consciousness is that of a boy or a boy's daughter.

Another plan of shame awaits us once we have fully transitioned to being a man's daughter. Planned Offense: ......!

<blank>

<blank>

And here was Isiah with a look of astonishment on his face.

<blank>

"What, ...... Dear Sir, was he a man?"

"...... I'm a man. Didn't I tell you?"

"This is so cute, but ......!"

<blank>

Yeah. Even though she's so cute.

<blank>

You're such a cutie!"

You don't have to say it twice. ......"

'Well, Deere, your gender is Deere. Men aren't such lovely creatures, you know?"

"......That's for sure. ......He's such a cutie!"

I don't know. It's kind of disconcerting to be convinced there."

<blank>

This is why Dear-kun has to dress up as a boy for about half the week.

Either way, it looks like a girl dressed as a man, so no problem for me.

I'd like to periodically check to see if it's really lucky. ......

Now running the magic engine car "Star-kun No.2" remotely from the storage space of spatial magic.

Not as a magical tool, but in the manner of playing with a boondoggle with spatial magic.

It's boondoggle fun.

<blank>

Well, it's better to have information and evidence such as eyewitness testimonies, how long it actually takes to get there if you fly it, how dirty the body is, scars, and so on. Yeah, I'd like to have that kind of information and evidence.

<blank>

And as I looked out the window above me like that, I spotted a carriage being attacked by demons in front of the magic engine vehicle "Star-kun No. 2". The standard goblins and orcs, huh? We thinned them out, but there were still enough of them left to get out of the forest and attack people.

Should we go around ...... No, let's help out here. It's kind of antagonistic.

<blank>

<blank>

I swoop out of the storage space and sit down in the driver's seat. I designate the magic engine vehicle "Star-kun No. 2" as invincible. I went a little off the city road and ran over the goblins and orcs with gusto as it was.

<blank>

It was a complete car accident!

But there are no laws in this world to control collisions between magic engine vehicles and demons!

<blank>

Hi-yah-ha!　Excuse me before I go!"

What?　Thank you for your help..."

<blank>

I leave the thankful voices behind and run off. Okay, I've made my call, that's enough. I returned to my storage space.

Oh no, I helped people!

<blank>

"Aruji-sama, how about seafood soup for dinner tonight?"

I'm really impressed with your bardic skills. I mean, it's really great that you can cook, too, with your bardic skills."

It's an essential skill for travelers. Also, it's easier to express myself if I can make it myself. La-la-la-la blue seafood - a supreme dish filled to the brim - fragrant fennel and the scent of the sea - crunchy clams - kraken fillets crisp and dancing in your mouth - white fish swimming in your mouth - oh, let's all eat Aoyagi-tei seafood soup..."

Aisia takes out ingredients from the refrigerator space (a box connected to the refrigerator) while singing a commercial song of a store she doesn't know.

Ingredients purchased at Solacidore and Velarde (and used normally to some extent, and replicated and replenished if they seem to run out) can be used fresh as much as you want at any time. Cooking will also be in progress.

<blank>

Copying the finished product is fine, but having the food handmade is exceptional.

In other words, I will try not to copy cooking as much as possible. I have to spend my living expenses properly to keep the economy going. Thanks to Isiah, I don't have to worry about food!

<blank>

Wow, that's a real bargain, Isiah. If I'm going to marry someone, I'd really like someone who can cook. ...... is not good, not good. I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but it's a good idea. I'm not sure I want to get married to someone who can cook.

<blank>

That was close. I'm going to accidentally bond with Isiah. ...... Well, I can never release him!　There are so many secrets.

<blank>

----------------

Aruji-sama. There is even a song about how to cook local dishes.

I don't remember the lyrics to the first verse, but I'm sure it was a croquette or a 2. Was that croquette or ......2 was Neapolitan, though I only remember the first verse."
