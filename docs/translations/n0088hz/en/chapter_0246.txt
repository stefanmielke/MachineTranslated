# Greeting the Village Chief

<b>

"Welcome, Priestess, after your long journey!"

<b>

After returning, I was guided by Youki to greet the village chief. At first, I was taken aback by the presence of Arthur, the Thunder Dragon, even though he had shrunk in size, but I quickly composed myself and greeted him.

A muscular adult man with two horns protruding from his forehead. He bowed his head gracefully, but it was still slightly higher than my eye level.

<b>

"…(mumble mumble)"

"Hmm, hmm. Yes, yes… The Priestess says she is not in distress!"

<b>

Dear-kun whispered to me, and I responded.

<b>

This was because Dear-kun seemed reluctant to lie.

Dear-kun suggested, "Shall I say you are not in distress?" I heard that and replied as I did earlier.

<b>

I named it the "It's not a lie, I'm saying it" strategy!

<b>

Dear-kun thinks of me as the Priestess, so my statement counts as the Priestess's statement.

Youki and the others think of Dear-kun as the Priestess, so they accept it as Dear-kun's statement via me.

It's a compromise that satisfies both sides.

<b>

By the way, I belong to the faction that thinks Dear-kun is the Priestess. After all, she is a priestess and a princess, and she is definitely cute. Perfect for Dear-kun. Right?

<b>

"Thank you for your long journey, Priestess. Please wait a moment; we will prepare a small welcome feast for you…"

"(mumble mumble) No, it's just one day… I mean, do you really have the luxury to welcome us? You're being attacked by dragons, right?"

"…Hmm, hmm. The Priestess is worried about whether we have the resources for such provisions. Surely, the claim of being attacked by dragons is not a lie?"

"!? (mumble) I didn't say that much!"

"Also, it seems you don't need dinner since you just ate."

<b>

I did eat dinner normally in the container. If they were welcoming us, I should have been fed.

<b>

"N-No! Not at all! The dragons don't seem interested in our food, so the food storage is safe. Yes, then we will have the welcome feast tomorrow."

<b>

I see, so that's how it is.

<b>

"That's what the Priestess says. Ah, by the way, Arthur does eat normally, right? Is there a reason he doesn't raid the food storage? --Please ask him."

"Ah, yes. …Arthur, what do you think?"

'What’s in the food storage is grains, vegetables, and dried meat, right? He probably prefers fresh meat. There are prey in the forest, so he’s probably not targeting it.'

<b>

By the way, Arthur is in small mode, but he is currently speaking in Dragon language without using a vocabulary book.

This is a judgment to give him more dignity.

<b>

"…(mumble) So, what did Arthur say?"

"Hmm, hmm. According to the dragon, it seems that dragon likely prefers fresh meat over stored provisions."

"…If that's the case, we must indeed offer a sacrifice…"

<b>

The village chief drooped his head in despair.

<b>

"Well, we came to confirm whether that is correct or not."

"Um, is that so?"

"Yes, it is. Huh? Youki, didn’t you convey that?"

"No, I did mention it. But my father tends to not listen once he gets an idea in his head…"

<b>

I see, so Youki is the village chief's daughter. They are indeed a parent-child pair.

<b>

"Well, for today, let us rest. We only ask for a place to set up lodging."

"A place to set up lodging, you say?"

<b>

The village chief tilted his head.

<b>

"Yes. Youki should understand, right? After all, you came this far with us."

"Ah… Yes. That box is indeed more comfortable. Yes. Father, I think the backyard would be suitable."

"Um? Well, if that is acceptable to the Priestess and her party. Please come this way."

<b>

Thus, for today, we decided to place the container in the backyard and rest inside it.

If I toss the small box like a capsule, it will transform into a lodging anywhere.

By the way, the village chief said to Youki, "What a strange thing!? The magical tools of the city are amazing… Can we even buy such things?" Sorry, but they are not for sale even in the city.
