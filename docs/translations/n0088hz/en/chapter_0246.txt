# Greetings to the village head

<blank>

"Welcome, miko-sama, for you have traveled a long way."

<blank>

Yohki returned after that and led me to greet the village chief. At first he flinched at the fact that Arthur, the Thunder Dragon, was with him, even though he was smaller, but he quickly recovered and greeted him.

He is an adult male, quite muscular, with two horns on his forehead. He bowed his head neatly, but still a little higher than my eye level.

<blank>

"...... (Gonyo Gonyo)"

Mmm-hmm. Mm-hmm. ...... Miko Hime-sama says she doesn't want to suffer!"

<blank>

Mr. Deere overhears me and I speak.

<blank>

This is what I did because Mr. Dear seemed to be at a loss to lie.

Deere asks me, "Do you want me to say you're not bitter or something?" He suggests that I should tell him that I am not bitter. I listened to it and answered as I did before.

<blank>

The name of the plan is "I'm not lying, I'm telling you so!

<blank>

Dia, you think I am a miko princess, so if it is my statement, this qualifies as a statement by a miko princess.

Since Yohki and the others consider Dia-kun to be a miko princess, it is concluded that Dia-kun's statement was made through me.

It's called compromise, which both sides agree on.

<blank>

I am of the school of thought that Dia is a miko (shrine maiden) princess. Because she is a miko and a princess, and she is absolutely adorable. It's perfect for Dia-kun. Don't you think?

<blank>

We thank you for your long journey, Miko-sama. Please wait a little longer, and we will prepare a small but welcome banquet for you. ......

"(giggles) No, it's one day, and ...... or can we afford to welcome you?　We're being attacked by dragons, aren't we?"

'...... hmmm. The priestess is concerned about the affordability of such supplies. Surely you are not lying about being attacked by dragons?"

What?　（I didn't say that much!"

He also said he didn't want dinner because he had just eaten."

<blank>

You ate a normal dinner in the container. I should have been allowed to eat if you welcomed me.

<blank>

No, no!　No, sir!　The dragons don't seem to be interested in our food, and the pantry is just fine. Yes, we will have another welcome banquet tomorrow."

<blank>

I see, that's how it is.

<blank>

I hear you say, miko-sama. Ah. I mean, Arthur eats food normally, right?　Is there any chance he won't attack the pantry? --Please ask.

Oh, yes." ...... Arthur, how are you doing?"

You know, the ones in the pantry are grains, vegetables, and dried meat, right?　He likes fresh meat better, doesn't he? He's probably just not targeting them because there's prey in the forest.

<blank>

Arthur is in small mode, but now he is using dragon language without using a vocabulary book.

The decision was made because it would be more dignified.

<blank>

What did you say Arthur, at ...... (go figure)?"

'Hmmm. The dragon seems to be saying that its probably more interested in fresh meat than stockpiling it."

"If it is ......, then I still have to offer a sacrifice. ......

<blank>

Satonaga is sagging with disappointment.

<blank>

No, we're here to see if we're right.

"Mm, is that so?"

"That's right.　Oh, Yohki, you didn't tell him that part?"

No, I told him. My father has a tendency to not listen to people when they make assumptions. ......"

<blank>

I see, Yohki was the daughter of the village head. They are father and son, aren't they?

<blank>

I'm going to take the rest of the day off. I just need a place to stay."

A place to put the inn?

<blank>

The village head tilts his head.

<blank>

I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. You understand, don't you, Yuki?　We've come this far together."

Oh ...... yes. That box is certainly more comfortable. Yes, it is. Father, I think the backyard would be better."

Hmm?　Well, if that's all right with you, miko-sama. Please come this way."

<blank>

So, for today, we put a container in the backyard and rested in it.

Just toss a small box like a whippoy capsule and replace it with a container, and you have a lodging anywhere.

The village head said, "How mysterious!　The city's magic tools are amazing. ...... Is this something even we can buy?" He said to Yohki, "Unfortunately, it's not for sale even in the city. Unfortunately, it is not for sale even in the city.
