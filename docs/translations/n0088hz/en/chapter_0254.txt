# He was quite a talker

<b>

It seems that the dragons are not demanding sacrifices after all. So, I decided to negotiate with the dragons and have them play along with the charade.

<b>

After finishing the reconnaissance, I returned to the ritual hall.

<b>

"So, I went for a look, and he was quite a talker, Arthur."

"Sis, that's not really what talking means... No, it was the female who could talk, right? That's right."

"What’s that? If you have complaints about my body language, I’m open to discussion, you know?"

"That’s exactly what I mean! …I do feel a bit sorry for Kirigon-san…"

<b>

Arthur shrugged his shoulders in exasperation.

<b>

"So, are Dia-kun and Misha still asleep?"

"They're sound asleep. I got tired of pretending to be asleep, so I acted like I woke up when the medicine wore off."

<b>

Hmm, in that case, they might not wake up before the dragon couple arrives.

<b>

"Can’t you use your specialty spatial magic to quickly detoxify them?"

"…I don’t really know the components of the medicine. For now, I’ll just do a stomach wash."

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, the food in Dia-kun's stomach that contained the medicine disappeared.

Misha? She’ll wake up eventually.

<b>

And, whether it was effective or not, Dia-kun woke up shortly after.

<b>

"…Hmm, oh, good morning…?"

"Good morning, Dia-kun. You must be hungry, right? Want a sandwich?"

"…Thank you. Where is this place?"

<b>

I explained to Dia-kun that it was the ritual hall protected by a barrier.

<b>

"Eh? A barrier that repels men… but I’m here, right?"

"It seems Dia-kun wasn’t recognized as a man by the barrier!"

"Did you do something, big sister?"

"Yeah. I wrapped Dia-kun in my barrier to mislead them. It’s a secret, okay?"

<b>

Really, Dia-kun has such strong trust in me.

Also, the judgment only applied to the boundary area, so I’m not currently using any tricks to disguise gender.

<b>

"More importantly, Dia-kun! According to my investigation, it seems the dragons weren’t demanding sacrifices after all."

"Eh, is that so, Arthur? …Then it must be that uncle or perhaps another scheme at play. The first thing that comes to mind is slave trading."

<b>

Oh, slave trading. Right, insisting on a dragon's sacrifice while demanding pure maidens to be shipped off as slaves… it’s a plausible story. Could it be the male ogres that were in the forest?

And Dia-kun figuring that out right after waking up is really smart. Pat pat.

<b>

"Well, regarding that, I’ve got a little charade planned, so I think something will come to light."

"A charade, you say?"

"Of course, I’d like Dia-kun to cooperate as well, is that okay?"

"Yes. I don’t mind at all."

<b>

So, I explained to Dia-kun about the charade with the dragons.

It’s really a charade, but I plan to have Kirigon show his belly and roll around for Dia-kun.

<b>

"…Um, is that really okay? I mean, regarding the pride of the dragons."

"They said it was fine!"

"Well, since Sis won’t let him complain, I think Dia-kun should just do as he’s told!"

<b>

Listening to the winner is one of the good things about dragons, right?
