# He was quite a talker.

Apparently, the dragons are not demanding a sacrifice. So, we decided to negotiate with the dragons and ask them to go along with the farce.

<blank>

So, I returned to the ritual hall after my preview.

<blank>

So I went down to see him, and he was quite a talker, Arthur.

'Miss, that's not talking. ...... No, the female was a talker, wasn't she? I guess so.

What is it?　If you're not happy with my physical language, we can talk about it?"

I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but it's a good idea! ......I feel a little sorry for Mr. Kirigon. ......

<blank>

Oh dear," shrugs Arthur.

<blank>

So, are Dear and Misha still sleeping?"

I was tired of pretending to be asleep, so I acted like I had run out of medicine and woke up. I got tired of pretending to be asleep, so I acted like I woke up when the medicine ran out.

<blank>

Hmmm, then I might not be able to get up before the dragon couple arrives.

<blank>

Can't you just use your spatial magic to detoxify the body?"

I don't know much about the ingredients of ...... medicine. I'll just do a stomach wash for now."

<blank>

With a snap of his fingers, the drug-laden digestive food disappeared from Dear's stomach.

Misha?　It'll happen eventually.

<blank>

And this worked, Deere woke up soon after that.

<blank>

"...... hmm, hey, good morning ......?"

Good morning, Dear. You must be hungry.　Want a sandwich?"

"I'll take ....... Where am I?"

<blank>

I explain to Mr. Dia that it's a ritual hall protected by a ward.

<blank>

What?　I have a boundary ...... boku that plays men?"

Dear, it looks like the wards didn't recognize you as a man!"

Your sister did something to you."

I was so deceptive. I wrapped you in my warding and fooled you. It's a secret, okay?"

<blank>

I must say, Dear, your trust in me is very sincere.

Since the judgment was made only at the boundary, no tricks to misrepresent the gender are used now.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to think about that, Dia!　According to Miss Dia's investigation, it seems that the dragon was not the one who requested the sacrifice.

'Oh, really, Arthur? If it is ......, that means its uncle or another scheme. A quick thought would be the slave trade."

<blank>

Oh, the slave trade. I see, it's possible ...... that they demanded a pure maiden while claiming to be a dragon sacrifice and shipped her off as a slave. If it was the men of the demon tribe who were in the forest?

And Dia, you're really smart to deduce that in your sleep. I'm going to stroke you.

<blank>

Well, I'm going to have to play a little farce with you about that, too, so I'm sure something will turn up.

A travesty, is it?"

'Of course, we'd like you to help us out, Deere, okay?'

Yes, of course. That's fine, of course."

<blank>

And I explain to Mr. Dear about the farce with the dragon.

It's a travesty really, but we plan to have Kirigon show his belly to Dia-kun and have her rummage around.

<blank>

"...... Um, is that okay?　Well, you know, the pride of dragons aspect."

He said yes!"

I'm sure Miss Dia won't let you complain, so you'll just have to do as I say!

<blank>

It's a good thing that dragons will listen to anything the winner says!
