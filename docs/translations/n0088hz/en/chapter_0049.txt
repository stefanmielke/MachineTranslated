# There is no escape.

I'm Karina. I thought I was going to get a tribute to God, but I made a big mistake.

Oh, I'm so silly, silly!　Silly, silly, silly!

<blank>

Oh," he said, "you don't need that bandage anymore, do you? I don't need those bandages anymore, do I? ...... huh, I'll just use it to pay for the treatment. This was wrapped around my leg too, so I wonder if it can be treated as a sock."

"Who are you? ......"

I don't need to pry. I'm going to help your sisters, but can you close your eyes for a minute?"

<blank>

The sisters obeyed me obediently and closed their eyes.

...... I don't want them to make a fuss where I can't see them, so I'll put them in a time-stopped storage space separate from the normal storage space where Deer-kun is. I'll put him in a time-stopped storage space separate from the normal storage space where Mr. Dear is.

<blank>

<blank>

Let's see, so Gomez is at ......."

<blank>

Dear, your sister was not here. I will have to get Gomez to tell me where he sold it.

No. Should I try to hit the slavers in Velarde?　Hmmm, it's not necessarily sold to a slaver, and I'd say Gomez first. He was talking like he was going to be the next victim if we left him alone. And we have to retrieve the sacred artifact.

<blank>

I don't know where Gomez is right now. What are we gonna do?"

<blank>

There is a way to search for spatial magic, but I was very tired when I healed the ladies' legs earlier, so I don't want to use magic that spreads over a wide area. Basically, magic that affects a wide area outside of myself seems to be more tiring.

<blank>

"Let's just go ahead and collect the sacred objects first. ......

<blank>

Once there, I decide to return to the room of the Divine Model. Since we don't want to be transferred, we decide to walk the way we came.

<blank>

Yes, I'll just be passing by."

Oh?　A woman?　Why are you here--gobble."

"Hey, you little-- ugh!"

<blank>

While beating up a pirate I passed in the passageway, I returned to the door of the room of the sacred artifact - but the door of the room did not open. I was so impressed that I decided to go back to the room. ...... It's a very important room.

But with spatial magic, it's a piece of cake to open the lock. ......

<blank>

I don't see a keyhole on ......?

If you can't find the keyhole, you'll have to transfer directly into the room. ...... It's an unavoidable spatial grasp.

I mean, hmm?　I can't really see the room. Is it a wall?　Mm-hmm?　What's going on here?

In the first place, the door does not feel locked.

<blank>

Maybe the door is a magical tool or something?　Maybe it leads to the space where Poseidon is located only when Gomez opens it? Either way, there is a possibility that Gomez has some kind of key.

In other words, we need to find Gomez.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Think of it the other way around. Just grab Gomez and all will be well!"

<blank>

Yes, I guess you could say that it is easier to understand what we are supposed to do.

That's right!　If I go wild on the deck, will you come out that way?　Good idea, right?

<blank>

Once that is decided, we move to the deck!

Let's see, which way is the way. ...... I don't care. If you go straight through and smash through the ceiling and go up, you'll be on deck.

<blank>

<blank>

So we returned to the deck.

I appeared with a loud noise, and the pirates' underlings, who were preparing for battle on the deck, took notice of me.

<blank>

What the hell?　There's a big hole in the boat!

Hey, that's the girl who compared drinks with the captain. ......

"Hi!　You monster!

<blank>

Some don't know me, some know me from drinking competitions, and some were blown away at the warehouse.

Each of them reacted differently, but for the time being, they were all armed. Not only swords, but they even have guns on their waists.

What, this world has guns?　I saw it for the first time.

<blank>

"Phew. Hey, fellas, have you seen an elf girl?"

Who's going to answer even if they knew?　What are you going to do about that hole!

I said, "You've got a direct path on board, that's convenient. I told you to answer what you know, so why don't you guys just follow my lead and spit out the information?"

<blank>

Oh dear, I can't believe you don't understand simple Japanese. ...... No, it wasn't Japanese, it was this world.

<blank>

Hey," he said, "I'll take you alive!　Go for the limbs, I'll take you alive!　Let the body pay for the repairs."

I'm not afraid of God!　Fear not God, if you can take me alive, do it!　I am strong!"

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, a few people are running away. However, there is no escape from the boat.

In other words, he probably went to Gomez for help, which is what he wanted. Go ahead and ask for help.
