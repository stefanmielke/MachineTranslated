# There is no escape.

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. I thought I had gotten a gift for the gods, but I ended up making a huge mistake.

Ah, I’m such a fool! What an idiot!

<b>

“Oh. You don’t need that bandage anymore, right? …Haa, this should be enough for the treatment cost. Since it was wrapped around your leg, I wonder if it can be treated as a sock.”

“Who are you…?”

“No need to pry. Now, can you close your eyes for a bit while I help the older sisters?”

<b>

The older sisters obediently followed my words and closed their eyes.

…Since it would be troublesome if they caused a commotion where I can’t see, I’ll put them in a time-stopped storage space separate from the usual storage space where Dia-kun is. Toss, toss, toss.

<b>

<b>

“Um, so where is Gomez…?”

<b>

Dia-kun’s older sister wasn’t here. I would have to make Gomez spill where he sold them.

No, should I check with the slave trader in Verald? Hmm, it’s not certain he sold them to a slave trader, so I should go for Gomez first. He was having a conversation that made it seem like the next victim would appear if I left him alone. I also need to recover the divine artifact.

<b>

“Crap, I changed the markings, so I don’t know where Gomez is now. What should I do?”

<b>

I could search using spatial magic, but I’m quite tired from healing the older sisters’ legs earlier, so I don’t want to use magic that spreads over a wide area. Generally, magic that affects outside of oneself tends to be more exhausting.

<b>

“For now, I’ll recover the divine artifact first…”

<b>

I decided to return to the divine artifact room. Since I didn’t want to teleport, I would walk back the way I came.

<b>

“Excuse me, coming through~”

“Huh? A girl? Why are you here—guh!”

“Hey, you—ugh!”

<b>

While I knocked down the pirates I passed in the corridor, I returned to the door of the divine artifact room—but the door wouldn’t open. …It is an important room, so it’s probably locked.

However, using spatial magic, unlocking it should be a piece of cake—

<b>

…But there’s no keyhole?

If I can’t find a keyhole, I have no choice but to teleport directly inside the room… I guess I’ll have to use spatial perception.

Wait, huh? I can’t see well inside the room. Is it blocked? Hmm? What’s going on here?

It doesn’t even feel like the door is locked.

<b>

Could it be that the door is some kind of magical tool? Maybe it only leads to the space of Poseidon when opened by Gomez. Either way, there’s a possibility that Gomez has some kind of key.

In other words, I need to find Gomez.

<b>

<b>

“...Let’s think of it this way. If I catch Gomez, everything will be solved!”

<b>

Yes, yes, thinking like that makes what I need to do clear and straightforward.

That’s it! If I cause a ruckus on the deck, won’t he come out from there? Isn’t that a brilliant idea?

<b>

With that decided, it’s time to move to the deck!

Um, which way is it again…? It doesn’t really matter. If I just break through the ceiling, I should end up on the deck.

<b>

<b>

And so, I returned to the deck.

The pirates who were preparing for battle on the deck turned their attention to me as I appeared with a loud noise.

<b>

“W-What the hell are you!? Whoa, there’s a huge hole in the ship!?”

“Hey, isn’t that the girl who had a drinking contest with the captain…?”

“Eek!? A-A monster!”

<b>

Some didn’t know me, some knew me from the drinking contest, and some were the ones I had knocked out in the warehouse.

They each showed different reactions, but for now, all of them were armed. Not just swords, but they even had guns strapped to their waists.

Wait, there are guns in this world? This is the first time I’ve seen one.

<b>

“Phew. Hey, you underlings, do you know anything about an elf girl?”

“Even if we did, who would answer you!? More importantly, what are you going to do about that hole!!”

“It’s convenient since it made a direct path inside the ship. Since I asked you to tell me what you know, you should comply and spill the information!”

<b>

Good grief, they don’t even understand simple Japanese… Oh wait, this isn’t Japanese in this world.

<b>

“Hey! Aim for their limbs, we’ll capture her alive! We’ll make her pay for the repair costs with her body!”

“Ahaha! If you think you can capture me alive without fearing the gods, then go ahead and try! I’m strong!”

<b>

<b>

Oh, a few are trying to escape. But there’s no way to escape from the ship.

That means they’re probably going to seek help from Gomez, just as I intended. Keep calling him over!
