# It's working, it's working.

"Y-you bastard, remember this later, nyaaa!?"

<b>

Misha, with a bright red face and teary eyes, roars.

<b>

"Yikes, scary, scary. Ugh, it feels like the restraints are about to come off...!"

"When the restraints come off, that's your end, nyaaa!!"

"I'll pet you to keep you in a good mood. Also, the base of your tail. Pat pat pat..."

"Wait, seriously stop it, nya!? Ah, ah, ah, no, hey!?"

<b>

Ah, this is fun. Playing with a cat-eared beautiful girl in front of this many spectators isn't something you get to do every day.

<b>

"Karina! That doesn't seem like an attack that accumulates damage, does it—"

"It's a status effect inflicting attack, so what!?"

"Ugh, well then, I guess there's no helping it..."

"You! Referee! Stop this properly, nya!? There's no way such a status effect attack exists... Ah!"

<b>

Misha trembles. It's working, it's working.

<b>

"Ho ho ho, it seems the body is honestly affected by the status effect. Uh oh, it's about time the restraints are coming off! 10, 9, 8..."

"O-oh!? Just a few more seconds, nya!? Ugh, hurry, stop the patting, nya!"

"......naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, rock"

"Hey!? Don't slow down the count, nyaaaaaa!!!"

<b>

Misha, angry and flailing. Of course, the restraints don't come off.

Hehehe, this is what it means to strike a chord. It's getting really fun.

<b>

"I'm trying my best to hold on so the restraints don't come off, so of course the count is going to be slow. Right, referee?"

"Huh? Ah, is that so?"

"Hey! Don't be fooled, nya!? This guy isn't counting right now, nya!! The idea that it would come off with the count must be a lie!?"

"Go, four, three......"

"O-oh, just a little more! If I can hold on a bit longer, I'll be freed..."

"Three, two, one...... zero! (smack!) Zero! (smack!) Zeroooooo!! (smack!!!)"

"Migyaaaaaaaah!?"

<b>

Since the count reached zero, I smack her bottom hard, and Misha trembles and goes limp.

<b>

"Wait, the restraints didn't come off, nya?! You tricked me!?"

"No, I never said it would come off when the count reached zero, did I? It was just a countdown until I hit you."

"Youuuuuuuuuuu!!!! Pinyah!?"

<b>

Smack!! I deliver a final smack. Tears trickle down Misha's eyes.

<b>

"Phew, if I smack it about ten more times, the restraints might come undone. Hey, Misha, can you count how many times I've hit you?"

"Ugh… you're terrible, nya! You're toying with me…!!"

"Come on, I’m being nice by not taking off your spats, aren’t I? I could always show off Misha’s cute butt to the audience in the colosseum, you know?"

"Stop it, noooo!!"

<b>

Heh, I think that’s enough now.

<b>

"Oh, referee. I forfeit!"

"What?"

<b>

That’s what I declared.

<b>

"I’m at my limit, you see, and I just can't keep restraining Misha any longer."

<b>

I said this while gently patting Misha’s butt, feeling like a villain stroking a cat with a glass of wine in hand.

<b>

"Uh, the winner… Misha…?"

<b>

The referee announced the winner, albeit with some confusion.

The crowd erupted in boos.

<b>

"What the—!? Take it seriously!"

"This is a joke! She was obviously getting beaten the whole time!"

"Forfeit? Why? Misha didn’t even do anything!"

<b>

Well, of course. It’s pretty outrageous to quit like this when I wasn’t even serious. Misha shot me a glare.

<b>

"You… this is too much…!!"

"I’ll put that promised gold coin right inside your spats, okay?"

"Nya—! Cold…!"

<b>

I slid the coin into her spats through the tail hole.

It’s for the healer fund, but it’s fine; the gods will reimburse me later. Then, I leaned in close to whisper in her ear.

<b>

"Oh, and as a souvenir of our match, I’ll be taking your socks. Okay, Misha-chan?"

"H-Hey, since I won, that goes against the deal…!"

"Oh? Oh really? You actually think you won? Haha, that’s hilarious."

"…Just… take them… nya…!"

<b>

Misha, with teary eyes, let me pull off her socks since she still couldn’t move.

Ah, I got a bit carried away and really enjoyed myself. Sorry about that.

<b>

"…Losing so overwhelmingly, only to have the victory handed over! This is quite a humiliation for a fighter! Karina, you’ve done a brilliant job of shaming her! Genius! My beloved child!"

<b>

The divine statue shone brightly, clearly pleased.
