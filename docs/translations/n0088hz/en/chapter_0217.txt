# It works, it works.

You'll remember this later, nyaaah!"

<blank>

Misha, red-faced and teary-eyed, howls.

<blank>

I'm scared, scared, scared. Ugh, I'm almost out of restraints. ......!"

When the restraints are off, that's the end of you!

I'll pet him to put him in a good mood. And the base of the tail. Tontontonton......"

I'm not going to let you do that.　Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

<blank>

Oh, it was fun. It's not every day that I get to play with a beautiful cat-eared girl in front of such a large gallery of people.

<blank>

Carina player!　That doesn't sound like an attack that would accumulate damage--"

"It's an anomaly-inflicting attack, what is it?

Mmm-hmm!　Then it can't be helped. ......"

Damn it!　Referee Gorrah!　You've got to stop this thing properly!　There's no such thing as an abnormal attack like this ...... ahihi!"

<blank>

Misha is shaking. It's working, it's working.

<blank>

I'm not sure if the body is honestly in a state of shock or not, but it seems to be working. Oh, shit, I'm about to be unbound!　Ten, nine, eight. ......"

Oh, oh!　A few more seconds!　Ugh, hurry, stop thumping!

"...... naaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

Hey, hey, hey!　Don't slow down the count, eh nyaaaaah!!!!"

<blank>

Misha is angry and jittery. Of course, the restraints are not removed.

Hmmm... I guess that's what they mean when they say, "If you hit it, it will hit you. I'm having a lot of fun.

<blank>

I'm trying my best to hold out so the restraints don't come off, so of course the count will be slower. Right, judge?"

Huh?"　Oh, yeah, is that right?"

Hey!　You're cheating me!　He's not counting right now!　If he thinks he can solve the problem by counting, he's lying!

Go, yo, sahhhhhh ......"

'Whoa, whoa, just a little more!　Just a little more endurance and you'll be released. ......"

Nii, yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ...... zero! (Bashin!)　Zero! (Bashin!)　Zeroooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! (Bashhhhh!!!)"

Migyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa?"

<blank>

When the count reached zero, I slapped her ass as hard as I could, and Misha went limp, shaking and shaking.

<blank>

I'm not bound!　You tricked me!

I never said that I could solve the problem when the count reached zero.　It was just a countdown to the flap.

'Teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ！！！！　Pinyaaa!"

<blank>

Bash!　and slap his buttocks. Tears spilled from Misha's eyes.

<blank>

I'm sure if I hit him 10 more rounds, he'll probably release the restraints. Hey, Misha. Can you count how many times I hit you?"

"......Ugh, ugh, awful!　They're toying with me... ......!

'Oh come on, it's a sentiment when you don't take your spats off. If you want, you can expose Misha's preggy ass to the Coliseum audience."

Stop oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?"

<blank>

Hmmm...I think it's time to go.

<blank>

"Oh, judge. I give up."

What about?"

<blank>

I declared so.

<blank>

"Well, I'm at the end of my rope, and I can't hold Misha any longer.

<blank>

I say, while patting Misha's butt. I feel like a villain petting a cat while tilting a glass of wine.

<blank>

I'm a winner!　Misha, the player ......?

<blank>

The referee was puzzled and declared so.

The audience booed.

<blank>

What the hell?　Take it seriouslyーー！!"

Don't be silly!　You were one-sided, no matter how you look at it!"

"I give up!　Why?　Misha, you haven't done anything!

<blank>

That's right. I was too selfish, surrendering in addition to being unserious. Misha was also staring at me.

<blank>

"Oh ......, you've got to be kidding ......."

I'll keep one of the promised gold coins in my spats!

Nyahi!　Chill ......"

<blank>

And I screwed a gold coin through the tail hole into Misha's spats.

Healer funds, but God will make up for it later, and that's fine. Then I whisper softly into Misha's ear, who is still bound.

<blank>

I'll just take your socks as a souvenir of the match. Is that okay with you, Misha?"

"Ugh ......, I won, I made a mistake ......."

Huh?　Huh?　You think you've won with this?　Pfft, that's hilarious."

"......~~!　Motto, motto, nyah~~~!" "......~~!"

<blank>

Misha got teary-eyed and had me take off his socks. I still couldn't move.

Phew, I got into the groove and had fun too. My bad.

<blank>

...... overwhelmingly defeated and conceded the victory!　This is quite humiliating for a fighter!　Nice humiliation indeed, Karina!　Genius!　My dear child.

<blank>

And the god statue was shining in a good mood.
