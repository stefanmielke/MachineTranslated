# I thought it was a just right handicap (Staff Perspective)

<b>

At the request of Beast King Balbaros, this tournament was structured as a "warm-up" with 10 matches, followed by the 11th match being the first match of another competitor.

Aside from Balbaros declaring the start of the tournament, there was no announcement for the start of each match, and challengers would simply continue to face off one after another until they were defeated.

<b>

It was a request from Balbaros, a favorite to win and a regular champion. We had no objections, and I thought it was a just right handicap.

<b>

"The first 10 matches are just warm-ups. Let's just throw them together."

"How about this one who just submitted their entry? A D-rank adventurer from the Pavalkant Kingdom."

"Yeah, well, not too weak but not too strong either, a just right opponent. It should be a good warm-up for the first match. Plus, she's a woman, so it would make a nice memory for her to fight Balbaros."

<b>

That was just yesterday when we arranged the match. The odds were 1000 to 1.

And yet――

<b>

"Alright, I'll bet 82 gold coins on my victory!"

"……Huh?"

<b>

Saying that, she placed a bet of 82 gold coins on herself.

…Calculating the odds was going to be a hassle, but I seriously recalculated.

As a result, the odds turned out to be 10 to 1.

<b>

"What the heck, I could have just cheated and not had to calculate anything."

"Not a chance. This is a tournament with Balbaros participating, you know? …Besides, cheating 82 gold coins would be way too scary."

"True. That's way too much money to mess with. Still, how self-conscious can that young lady be? Wearing such fancy clothes, is she thinking of it as a betrothal gift for Balbaros?"

"Oh, in that case, I definitely can't cheat. If she performs well, she might be chosen as Balbaros's concubine."

<b>

We were laughing like that just this morning. And then――

<b>

"What the hell is going on!? What just happened!?"

"Uh, wait. Huh?"

<b>

Balbaros was defeated in an instant. He was thrown just once and stopped moving.

It had been too long for us to be in shock; the referee was at a loss and declared Balbaros's defeat――Karina's victory.

<b>

"Uh, um. What happens to the tournament now?"

"What do you mean what happens? For Balbaros to lose in the first match, that's an outrageous upset!?"

<b>

My colleague was in complete chaos.

And it was understandable; who would have thought Balbaros would lose to such a young human girl……

<b>

In the midst of the confusion, Balbaros came down from the stage, speaking in an excited tone.

<b>

"Wow, I never thought I would be taken down before I could even show my hands, feet, or fangs! That woman is incredible! Hey, who is she? Show me the entry sheet!"

"Uh, um, yes!"

"Ho, Karina Shonin…… a merchant adventurer!? Gahaha! And a D-rank!! Is she a ringer? No, her skills definitely seemed more than her age would suggest!"

<b>

Balbaros was happily laughing as he looked over Karina's documents.

<b>

"Uh, um, Balbaros! What should we do about the tournament's progress!?"

"Hm?? Ah, right. I had planned for 11 consecutive matches…… No problem, we can continue as is."

"Uh, but that means Karina will have to fight consecutively…"

"She is the woman who defeated me, right? There should be no problem; she will win. I would even bet my country on it."

"Y-Yes, understood!"

<b>

As for the 11 consecutive matches, we proceeded as Balbaros instructed. One challenger after another faced Karina.

And just as Balbaros had predicted, Karina continued to defeat her opponents.

Balbaros watched with sparkling eyes like a boy, genuinely happy and enjoying the spectacle.

<b>

And, just as Balbaros had said, without any trouble, Karina won all 11 matches――up to the first round.

<b>

"Gahaha! What the hell is that ridiculous strength! I can't even grasp the depths of her power, or even the limits! What kind of trick is this!? No, I don't even care if it's a trick!! I want to know the secret of that strength!!"

"Are you really saying that, Balbaros?"

"Of course! When was the last time I felt this excited? She is surely going to give birth to strong children…… Hmm, should I have my son propose to her? No, maybe I should do it myself…… Ah, but I can't win! Right, I can't win! I can't even hope to pin down those slender arms or that soft skin! Gahaha! How pathetic as a male!!"

<b>

Saying that, Balbaros bared his fierce fangs and wore a wicked grin.

As a member of the white wolf tribe, he was genuinely enjoying himself and laughing.

<b>

<b>

……However, I never expected her to breeze through 11 consecutive matches.

If bets could be placed during this tournament…… right now, Karina's odds would probably be 1 to 1, at most 1.5 to 1.

<b>

Then it hit me.

……What if, when Karina placed her bet of 82 gold coins, I had calculated the odds carelessly…… and she ended up winning the tournament?

<b>

That would have resulted in a massive loss!

<b>

"……I'm really glad I calculated properly! I'm so relieved I didn't do it carelessly……!!"

<b>

I genuinely praised myself for doing my job seriously.
