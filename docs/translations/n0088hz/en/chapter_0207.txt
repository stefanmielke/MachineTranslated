# I thought it was just the right handicap (staff perspective)

<blank>

At the request of the Beast King Barbaros-sama, the format of this tournament was to play 10 matches as a "preparatory exercise" and then go straight to the 11th match, which was the first match for the other players.

There is no declaration of the start of the tournament other than the initial announcement of the start of the tournament by Barbaros-sama, and the format is that if one challenger is beaten, the next challenger will take up the challenge.

<blank>

It was the request of Mr. Barbaros, who was the favorite and, in fact, a regular winner. We had no objections and thought it was a good handicap.

<blank>

I'm just going to do the first 10 rounds. Let's just put them together."

How about this guy who just applied to join?　He's a D-rank adventurer from the Kingdom of Pavelkant."

It's a good opponent, not too weak, not too strong, just right for the first game to get used to. And being a woman, it will be a nice souvenir for me to fight Master Barbaros."

<blank>

And it was yesterday when we set up the match. The dividend was 1000 times what it should have been.

And yet--

<blank>

'Well then, I'll take 82 gold coins for my win!

"...... yes?"

<blank>

Then, the person in question bet 82 gold coins on himself.

I'm having a hard time calculating the ...... dividend, but I'm serious about re-calculating it.

As a result, the dividend settled at a whopping 10 times.

<blank>

"What the heck, I could have just fooled around and not had to do the math."

I don't think so. I mean, it's too scary to cheat on 82 gold coins, right? I mean, ......, I'd be too scared to cheat on 82 gold coins."

'Indeed. Too much money, I'm afraid. But how self-conscious is that young lady?　Wearing such a fashionable dress, does she think it's a betrothal gift to Mr. Barbaros?

Ah.  If I try to fight a good fight, I might be chosen as Barbaros-sama's concubine.

<blank>

My colleagues and I were laughing about that this morning. And--

<blank>

What are you going to do?　What's going on!"

Eh, ah. Huh?　Huh?"

<blank>

Master Barbaros was killed instantly. He was thrown only once and stopped moving.

Too much time had passed to say that he was too awestruck and let go. The judges couldn't help themselves and declared Master Barbaros defeated - Kalina the winner.

<blank>

"Uh, you know what? What's going to happen to this progression?"

I'm not sure what to make of it!　It's not a big surprise that Barbaros was beaten up in the first round!"

<blank>

My colleagues are in turmoil.

No wonder, I never thought that Master Barbaros would be defeated by such a little human tribe girl. ......

<blank>

The staff members were still in the midst of confusion when Mr. Barbaros came down from the stage and spoke to them in a tone of excitement.

<blank>

I never thought I would be beaten before I could even get my hands, feet, or fangs out!　That woman is amazing!　Hey, what kind of person is that?　Show me the entry sheet!

Uh-oh.

"Ho, Karina Shonin ...... is a peddler-adventurer?　Ha-ha-ha!　And you're a D rank!　Is she a double?　No, that kind of feeling was certainly young and soft, more than appropriate for her age to call herself skilled.

<blank>

Mr. Barbaros smiles happily as he looks over Carina's documents.

<blank>

Oh, uh, Barbaros-sama!　How shall we proceed with the tournament?

Mm?"　Oh, I see. Oh, by the way, we were going to do 11 rounds in a row. ...... No matter, just keep going like this."

"To. And, but that would mean that Kalina would have to fight a series of ......"

"She beat me like that?　I have no problem with that, I will win. I'll bet my country on it."

Yes, sir, I'm sorry!

<blank>

As for the 11 rounds, we did as Master Barbaros said. One after another, challengers took on Karina.

And here, too, as Mr. Barbaros had announced, Karina beat her opponents one after another.

Master Barbaros gazed at it with sparkling eyes like a boy, looking really happy and joyful.

<blank>

And, as Mr. Barbaros said, Karina won 11 rounds without any difficulty - even the original first round.

<blank>

Gahahahaha!　What is that bullshit strength?　I, myself, have no idea what the bottom, or even the frame, of strength is!　What kind of a trick is that!　No, I don't care if it's a trick!　I want to know the secret of that strength!

"You insist, Master Barbaros."

No wonder!　I haven't been this agitated in years!　He'll make a strong boy. ...... Well, shall I let him court my son?　No, I'd rather do it myself ...... but I can't win, can I?　Oh, but I can't win!　I can't even lay my hands on those slender arms and soft skin!　Ha-ha-ha!　I'm a pathetic male!

<blank>

Saying so, Mr. Barbaros bares his ferocious fangs and smiles viciously.

As a white wolf tribe, it's really just a smile of pure fun and laughter.

<blank>

<blank>

...... but I never thought I would make it through 11 rounds in a row without a struggle.

If you can bet money on this tournament in the middle of the day, ...... right now, Karina's payout will probably be 1x, 1.5x at most.

<blank>

And then, I suddenly realized something.

......What if Karina had bet 82 gold coins and calculated the payout properly ...... would she win as is?

<blank>

There was absolutely massive damage!

<blank>

I'm so glad I got the ...... calculation right!　I'm so glad I didn't do it right. ......!"

<blank>

I seriously praised myself for doing a serious job.
