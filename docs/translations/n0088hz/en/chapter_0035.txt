# Tasting Comparison (Pirate's Perspective) 1

(Since it got long, it's split into two parts)

----------------

<b>

I am Gomez. I lead a band of pirates.

Being a pirate is a noble job that protects the peace of this town. Our trading partners are the nobles who govern this town, and we pirates are their direct subordinates.

<b>

So, I am important. Therefore, I can do whatever I want.

<b>

One day, as usual, after finishing a job, I was drinking with my subordinates at the commercial guild when a well-dressed woman walked in. Overhearing her conversation, it seemed she had brought in some alcohol.

<b>

"Hey! Is that alcohol? Shall I buy it for you? I was just wanting some booze."

<b>

She then said she had three bottles of alcohol for sale.

However, upon seeing it, it was Sorashidore's apple wine. A weak and overly sweet drink.

<b>

I don't need it. Even so, since I said I would buy it, I must.

I would like to say to give it all for free, but in front of the commercial guild, some monetary exchange is necessary.

<b>

So, one bottle for one copper coin, right?

Seriously, bringing in such alcohol. You should reflect on that.

<b>

By the way, you should be happy to have the record of being able to sell to me, right?

Ah, that's right. It would be good to have you show some reflection with that body of yours.

<b>

"Wait, Gomez-san!! It's against the rules for guild members to have disputes!"

"What's wrong with that? I heard something about lotion too, right? You're the one who uses it, so I'll entertain you."

<b>

As I tried to grab the woman's shoulder, my hand cut through the air.

...Huh?

<b>

"Hmph, if you want to buy me, bring 100 gold coins, drunkard."

<b>

What are you saying, 100 gold coins? Ah, I must have misheard. 100 silver coins, right?

Seriously, you must really want to sell yourself high, huh?

<b>

"100 coins? Well, if you want to become my woman, I might consider it."

<b>

If you satisfy me, I'll pay.

The woman laughed through her nose at my kind proposal.

<b>

<b>

"Eh? Come on, staff member. Getting angry over this means you admit your own smallness, right? A big person wouldn't care about this at all. Huh? Are you saying there's someone here with such a small mind?"

"........No, um!?"

<b>

The staff member looked at me awkwardly.

Hey, does that mean I'm the small one!?

<b>

As I calmly listened to the young girl's nonsense, it seemed the alcohol was going to be bought by the guild.

Tch. Seriously, a young girl who doesn't understand the way of the world. If she had offered me alcohol, she could have become my woman.

<b>

<b>

"So, please buy the alcohol again from the guild, okay? Um, what was your name again... Gomez-desu-san?"

"Ahhh!? What did you say, you bastard!?"

<b>

You mispronounced my name!? Damn, you're underestimating me!!

I signaled to my subordinate with my hand. To attack her later.

<b>

It's fine, just like usual, I'll wrap her up and put her on the ship, that's all I need to do.

Then she would be able to be judged by me for the "crime of trying to illegally set sail with a merchant ship"!

<b>

Of course, the death penalty—no! I'll take everything from her and sell her off to a brothel near the slums!

Though, that’s only if she stays alive until I feel like selling her!

<b>

"Shut up, you lowly one."

<b>

Huh!?

<b>

I stiffened as the young girl glared at me. Ah, my legs won't move!?

No way, is this me being intimidated!?

<b>

As the girl let out a laugh and stopped glaring, my legs became able to move again.

Could it be, is she a formidable opponent...?

<b>

"Now then, Gomez-desu-san? How about we have a little competition here? How about a drinking contest? It seems some good alcohol has just come in?"

<b>

!

<b>

You fool, I've never lost in a drinking contest.

<b>

"A competition!? Fine, I'll take that fight! A pirate's life is over if they're underestimated!"

"The loser pays! If I lose, I'll pay with my body!! I can swear to God on that!"

"Bring it on, you!"

<b>

I signaled to my subordinate again.

To arrange for a special "alcohol."
