# Drinking Comparison (Pirate's Perspective) 1

(Split into two episodes because it got too long)

My name is Gomez. I'm a pirate head.

Being a pirate is a great job to keep the peace in this town. The people we deal with are the nobles who rule this town, and we pirates are their direct subordinates.

<blank>

So I'm great. So I can do whatever I want.

<blank>

One day, as usual, I was having a drink with my minions at the commercial guild after a day's work when a beautiful woman came in. Eavesdropping on their conversation, I heard that she had brought in some alcohol.

<blank>

Oh!　Sake!　I'll buy it for you!　I just needed some booze."

<blank>

He then offered to sell me three bottles of sake.

But when I saw it, it was Solacidore's apple wine. It was a weak and sweet liquor.

<blank>

I don't need it. But I have to buy it because I said I would buy it.

I would say give it all away for free, but the commercial guilds need to exchange money.

<blank>

So, one copper per bottle, right?

Damn it, you brought that kind of alcohol into this place. You should be sorry.

<blank>

I mean, you'll get an achievement for buying from me, so you'll be happy, right?

Ah yes. I would love to have that body show some remorse as well.

<blank>

Mr. Gomez!　It's against the law for guild members to tangle with each other!

I heard the lotion and everything. I could hear the lotion and stuff, you know?　You use it, I'll deal with it."

<blank>

And when I tried to grab the woman's shoulder, a scuffling hand cut through the air.

...... An?

<blank>

'Hmph, if you want to buy me, you'll have to bring me a hundred gold coins, drunk.

<blank>

What are you talking about, 100 gold coins?　Oh, I misheard. A hundred silver coins.

You really seem to want to sell yourself too high, don't you?

<blank>

A hundred?　Well, if you're going to be my girl, I might consider it."

<blank>

If you satisfy me, I'll pay you.

The woman snickered at my kind suggestion.

<blank>

<blank>

Eh?"　I don't like it, staff. If you get angry at this, it means you admit you have a small capacity, right?　If you are a person of large capacity, this has nothing to do with you at all. Hmm?　Don't tell me, Mr. Staff, that there are people with such small capacity here?

"............ No, I mean!

<blank>

A staff member looks at me awkwardly.

Hey, does that mean I'm small!

<blank>

As I calmly listened to the little girl's nonsense, I heard that the guild was going to buy the liquor.

Damn. You are a little girl who doesn't know how things work. You could've been my girl if you'd just paid me for my drink.

<blank>

<blank>

So, please buy your alcohol from the guild again. Um, what's your name, Mr. ...... Gomendez?"

Aaaaaaah!　What the hell, you!"

<blank>

You got my name wrong?　Damn, you licked me!

I signal my men with my hand. I give a hand signal to my men to attack this guy later.

<blank>

Don't worry, we'll just roll him up in a fishtank and put him on the boat like we always do, that's all we need to do.

Then this guy will be free for me to try him for 'illegally trying to launch a merchant vessel!

<blank>

Of course, I'll be executed - no!　We will take everything and sell them to a whorehouse near a slum!

That is, if I live long enough to sell!

<blank>

"Shut up, you son of a bitch."

<blank>

What?

<blank>

The little girl stared at me and my body tensed up. Oh, I can't move my legs!

Don't tell me I'm being intimidated!

<blank>

Huff," the little girl snickers and stops glaring at him, and his legs start to move.

Don't tell me this guy is some kind of badass powerhouse ......?

<blank>

Now, Mr. Gomendez?　How about a game of one here?　How about a drinking contest? I hear they just got some good sake in stock.

<blank>

Oh my god!!!

<blank>

I've never lost a drinking contest, you idiot.

<blank>

"A fight?　Fine, I'll buy you that fight!　A pirate is done for if he's taken advantage of!"

The loser buys!　If I lose, I'll pay you with my body!　I swear to God, okay?"

I'll take my chances, bitch!

<blank>

I signal my crew again.

I'm trying to get them to arrange a special 'drink'.
