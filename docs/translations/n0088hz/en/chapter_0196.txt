# Isn't that the same system as this one!

After watching the Sudegoro tournament, we decided to wander around the town at random, looking for a place to stay.

<blank>

There are plenty of accommodations in Terra Realvy, a country that welcomes tourists, and there is no need to rush to find one.

Also, if worst comes to worst and you can't find a place to stay, no problem, just take it easy and go for a walk. We have a base.

<blank>

They only want the inn to serve as 'a safe place to put a door in and out of the base' and 'an alibi that they are staying there.

It's quite an advantage to be able to stay anywhere in a private lodging room.

<blank>

As for me, I'd ask for food for reference, but that could be done in a restaurant or a bar."

Isiah is so serious."

<blank>

The area around the colosseum was bustling with markets and food stalls. Half of the people on the street were easily recognizable as beastmen because of their ears and tails.

There was also a second-hand clothing shop in the stall. Most of the pants they sell have a hole for a tail, and for those who do not have a tail, they also sell "tail hole plugging rags". They also sell hagiographies to cover the tail hole for those who don't have a tail. This is indeed an animal country and a tourist attraction.

<blank>

"Well, that's good business. If you plug the tail hole, you can't return it."

"Oh, is that so, Deere?"

"Once again, you can sell it as used clothing, but it's like, 'I've plugged my tail hole, so I can't sell it to anyone else anymore.'"

<blank>

When I was told this, my memories of Japan came back to me with a huff.

When I went to Kyoto on a junior high school excursion, there were stores selling Merikensacks and handcuffs that had nothing to do with Kyoto, and a 'free name engraving service', but ...... now that I think about it, that is the same system as this one!

Oh my god. I was so happy to buy a Merikensack and have my name put on it!　And it's still in my desk at my parents' house without ever being used. ......

<blank>

...... Well, that's a great memory!"

And if you don't return it, it's none of our business. Yes."

<blank>

Well, it took up less space than a wooden sword, and the teacher didn't notice. Those who bought wooden swords were usually scolded by their teachers.

<blank>

<blank>

And when I bought some unfamiliar fruits and vegetables at the tourist market, I remembered that I had not been to the merchants' guild or the adventurers' guild.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Mister Aruji, I didn't realize it myself. I didn't realize it myself."

I was thinking a little bit about how you and your sister are sightseeing today."

I went to the arena for the first time and forgot all about it. I'm going out for a while.

<blank>

and headed to the merchant guild, marking Deere and his friends.

I knew the location immediately because I asked the owner of the grocery store where I had just shopped.

<blank>

<blank>

In.

I wholesaled fire wine to the commercial guild and got 3 gold coins. I wanted to purchase something, but since the main industry here is tourism centered on the Coliseum, there seemed to be no unusual specialty products.

<blank>

Maybe I should buy some unfamiliar fruits and vegetables from the market. No, they don't seem to last that long, and it would be strange for a peddler to stock them. ......?　Or maybe if I insist that the healer has prepared a refrigerator: ......?

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm, I thought to myself, but next I went to the Adventurer's Guild to fulfill a delivery request from Tessin and get some pocket money.

I was just thinking, "Well, let's go meet up with Dia and the others," when I was approached by the receptionist.

<blank>

Oh, congratulations, you've been promoted to the D rank."

Oh, really?"　I did it. Please follow the procedure."

<blank>

I'm pretty sure the D rank requirement is that you need to earn 2 large silver coins per month and for a period of time?　I've had a rough time earning money with the lumberjacks before.

<blank>

I'd like to promote one of the 'fakers' party members, the healer, to the C rank. Please let them know."

Oh, yeah. Roger that."

<blank>

What, I was passed over for a C rank or something?　I didn't complete any requests in particular. ...... Oh, I guess my achievements at Carcassa were piling up. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a new one, but it's a good idea to have a new one.

<blank>

By the way, Dear...

That person is still ranked E."

<blank>

Well, Dear, as an adventurer, all I do is request deliveries.

<blank>

Yes, if you want to move up in rank in this town, you can participate in guild-sponsored tournaments."

Huh?"

<blank>

In the case of a tournament sponsored by the Adventurers' Guild, participation is treated as a request from the Adventurers' Guild, and the fight money is also treated as a commission.

So there are party warfare competitions and such. Oh, well, that's a good thing I've heard.

<blank>

Since it's a good opportunity, I think I'll raise your rank too, Dear!
