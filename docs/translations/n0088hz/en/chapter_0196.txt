# Isn't that the same system as this one!!

<b>

<b>

After finishing watching the Sudegoro Tournament, we decided to wander around the town while looking for an inn.

<b>

In the tourist-friendly country of Terrarial Ruby, there are plenty of inns, so there's no need to rush.

Also, even if we can't find a place to stay, it's not a problem, so we can stroll around leisurely. We have a base after all.

<b>

We only require the inn to serve the purpose of "a safe place to put a door for entering and exiting the base" and "to create an alibi that we are staying there."

Any private room inn would be fine, which is quite an advantage.

<b>

"I would like to ask for meals as a reference, but that can also be done at restaurants or taverns."

"Ishia is quite serious, huh?"

<b>

Around the coliseum, there are markets and stalls bustling with activity. Half of the people passing by had ears and tails, making it clear they were beastmen.

There was also a second-hand clothing stall. Most of the pants for sale had tail holes, and for those without tails, they sold "patches to cover the tail hole" as well. It seems they will even do the sewing for free. As expected of a beastman country and a tourist destination.

<b>

"Wow, that's a clever business. Once you cover the tail hole, returns are probably not accepted."

"Eh, is that so, Dia-kun?"

"You can sell it again as second-hand clothing, but it feels like 'since the tail hole is covered, it can't be sold to anyone else.'"

<b>

Hearing that, a memory from Japan suddenly resurfaced.

When I went to Kyoto on a school trip, there was a store selling nothing related to Kyoto, like brass knuckles and handcuffs, and they had a 'free name engraving service'... Now that I think about it, isn't that the same system as this one!!

What a surprise. Back then, I bought brass knuckles without realizing anything and was happy to have my name engraved on them! They are still in my family's desk without ever being used...!!

<b>

"Well, that's a good memory in its own way!"

"If you don't return it, it's irrelevant anyway. Yes."

<b>

Well, it takes up less space than a wooden sword, and the teacher didn't find out either. Those who bought wooden swords were scolded by the teacher, haha.

<b>

<b>

As I bought some unfamiliar fruits and vegetables at the tourist market, I suddenly remembered that I hadn't gone to the merchant guild or the adventurer guild.

<b>

"I'm sorry, my lord. I didn't notice either."

"Now that you mention it, I was thinking that I was sightseeing with you today."

"Yeah, I completely forgot after heading straight to the arena. I'll go check it out."

<b>

With that, I marked Dia-kun and the others and headed to the merchant guild.

I quickly found it by asking the owner of the vegetable shop where I had just shopped.

<b>

<b>

So.

I delivered fire liquor to the commercial guild and got three gold coins. I thought about getting something else while I was at it, but since the main industry here revolves around tourism centered around the coliseum, it seems there are no rare local products.

<b>

Maybe I should buy some of those unfamiliar fruits and vegetables from the market. No, they probably don't last long, so it would be strange for a mere traveling merchant to stock them... If a healer insists they have a refrigerator, perhaps...?

<b>

<b>

Hmm, while thinking about that, I went to the adventurer guild next, completed a delivery request from Tesshin, and earned some pocket money.

Now, I was thinking of reuniting with Dia-kun and the others when I was approached by the receptionist.

<b>

"Oh, congratulations. You've been promoted to D-rank."

"Oh, really? Awesome. Please take care of the paperwork."

<b>

If I remember correctly, the conditions for D-rank were to earn two silver coins a month and a certain period, right? I had some earnings from lumberjacking before.

<b>

"Among the members of the 'Fakers' party, the healer can be promoted to C-rank. Please let them know."

"Oh, I see. Got it."

<b>

Wait, I got surpassed to C-rank? I feel like I hadn't completed any requests... Oh, it must be because of my achievements in Calcutta. That reward was in gold coins, after all.

<b>

"By the way, Dia-kun is..."

"That person remains at E-rank."

<b>

Well, Dia-kun has only done delivery requests as an adventurer, so it can't be helped.

<b>

"By the way, if you want to level up in this town, participating in guild-sponsored tournaments is also an option."

"Oh, really?"

<b>

In the case of tournaments sponsored by the adventurer guild, participation is treated as a request from the adventurer guild, and fight money is also treated as a reward for the request.

There are also party battle tournaments. Oh, that's good information to have.

<b>

Since it's a great opportunity, maybe Dia-kun should level up too!
