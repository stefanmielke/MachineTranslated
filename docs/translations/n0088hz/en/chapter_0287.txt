# Waking up.

<blank>

I woke up and what came into view was a white ceiling, like the ones in infirmaries and hospitals.

<blank>

"I ain't say ............, I say ......!"

"It's the ceiling you don't know. ......"

Hey Kaoru!　I didn't tell you!"

<blank>

I turned my head to the side toward the voice and found Kaoru tied to the bed. I was also tied to the bed and could only move from the neck up.

They are secured in a large position with leather belts on their wrists and ankles. If I could use spatial magic, this would be no big deal. ...... Damn, why can't I use it!

<blank>

'Wait a minute, why is Kaoru tied up?　What happened?"

Sorry, I just woke up. I probably lost it. Somehow I got stuck right after Karina too. ......"

OH...... so you were a 'God made body' too?"

Oh!　That's what I'm told!　I myself was a divine instrument!

<blank>

You clunker!　And Golem would have been a mere puppet without Kaoru's support. They would have lost easily.

<blank>

Let me apologize for one more thing.

What?　What?"

I actually knew the ceiling. This is our infirmary."

I know this dungeon because it's your house.

<blank>

Why did he say he didn't know about the ceiling? He must have just wanted to say it.

Oh, well, what happened to Misha?

<blank>

"Oh, you guys awake?"

Good morning, Master, sir."

<blank>

I looked in the opposite direction and saw Misha drinking tea made by the maid.

It was a far from elegant tea time, with about five cubes of sugar poured in and sloshing around.

<blank>

'...... Good morning. Hey Misha, why are you having tea with the maid?　And we're tied up."

What?　It's obvious. It's because I betrayed Karina.

"This is what it's like to have your dog bite your hand, damn it!"

I thought you had a cat there.　Well, that's okay. I'm not afraid of a stuck Carina, I'll play a prank on her as usual!

<blank>

Saying that, Misha squeezed my breasts, which were stuck in the air. Hyan, hey, hey, ah?　Don't stick your fingers in my cleavage. ...... hmm?　What is that, a stick ...... file?

Mu, titty kneading is in the letter ...... su, ki, mi, te, tsu, ka, e ...... 'Use the gap'?　I'm sorry, Misha!　I'm sorry I suspected something!

<blank>

'G, gnnnnnn, I'm so pathetic I'm tearing up ......'

"Ha, now I don't owe you anything!　I'll be your defaulting meow!"

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's an act or not!　Misha laughs with an unpleasant face that I can't believe he is acting. No, acting, huh?　Acting, right?　Sorry, I still have my doubts.

It's a file planted in my chest by the way ......, but I can't use it because my hands and feet are restrained. I knew Misha was Misha, right?

<blank>

Now, Rena-chan, they're awake, what are you going to do now?"

Now that we've got you restrained, what do we do now? For now, I like the idea of teaching the body which way is up."

<blank>

Eh!　A naughty one!　If it's a naughty one, I'm not a bit stingy!

<blank>

"Then let's implant this divine device, the 'brainwashing chip worm,' into your brain, shall we?"

Choma!　Stop that guy, Misha!　That's a bad guy!　That's a bad guy!　No one is looking for that kind of thing!　Help!

You say, "Oh, well. I don't have to listen to the POW's demands, do I?　Also, there is a demand for me. A girl who is brainwashed and becomes a good girl is naughty, isn't it? ......　Now, let's see. Which should I put in first, the ear or the nose?"

<blank>

That's just the way it is!

Ohhhhhh stop that white caterpillar the size of your pinky finger get away from me!
