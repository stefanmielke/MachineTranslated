# Waking Up

<b>

What entered my view when I woke up was a white ceiling, like the ones found in a health room or a hospital.

<b>

"........I won't say it...!"

"I don't know this ceiling..."

"Hey Kaoru! I didn't say anything!!"

<b>

Turning my face towards the voice, I saw Kaoru tied to a bed. And I was also tied to a bed, able to move only my head.

Leather belts were strapped to my wrists and ankles, fixing me in a spread-eagle position. If I could use spatial magic, this wouldn't be a problem... Ugh, for some reason, I can't use it!?

<b>

"Wait a minute, why is Kaoru tied up? What happened?"

"Sorry, I just woke up too. I think we probably lost. For some reason, I couldn't move right after Karina..."

"OH... I see, you were also a 'body made by the gods'?"

"Huh!? Now that you mention it, that's right!! I was a divine tool myself!?"

<b>

This useless idiot!! And without Kaoru's support, the golem is just a puppet. It must have lost easily.

<b>

"Can I apologize for one more thing?"

"Huh? What is it?"

"Actually, I knew this ceiling. This is our infirmary."

"I see, since this dungeon is your place, you know the ceiling."

<b>

Why did this guy say it was an unknown ceiling? He must have just wanted to say it.

By the way, what happened to Misha?

<b>

"Oh, you guys are awake, nya?"

"Good morning, Master, guests."

<b>

Looking in the opposite direction, I saw Misha drinking tea made by a maid.

She added about five sugar cubes and slurped it down, a tea time far from elegant.

<b>

"......Good morning. Hey Misha, why are you having tea with a maid? And while binding us up?"

"Eh? It's obvious, nya. I betrayed Karina, nyaaa!!"

"To be bitten by your own dog, this is it, damn it!!"

"Nya, isn't that a pet cat? Well, whatever. I'm not scared of the bound Karina, I'll play a prank as a thank you!!"

<b>

Saying that, Misha started to knead my chest, which couldn't move. Hyahn, wait, what? Don't stick your fingers in my cleavage... Huh? Is that a stick... a stick file?

Mmm, the way she's playing with my breasts is turning into letters... S, K, I, M, I, T, E, T, S, U, K, A, E... 'Use it when there's a chance'? M-Misha!? I'm sorry for doubting you!?

<b>

"Ugh, ugh, it's so pathetic that tears are coming out..."

"Ha! With this, we're even, nya! I won't pay you back, nya!"

<b>

Nya-ha-ha-ha! Misha laughed with a lewd expression that didn't seem like an act. No, it's an act, right? Huh? It's an act, right? Sorry, I'm still a bit suspicious.

...By the way, about that file hidden in my chest, I can't use it since both my hands and feet are bound. Misha really is Misha, huh?

<b>

"Well then, Rena-chan, these guys are awake, but what should we do now?"

"Well, it's good that we bound them, but what should we do? For now, teaching them which is superior might be good."

<b>

Eh!? An erotic thing!? If it's an erotic thing, I'm not entirely against it!

<b>

"Then let's implant this divine tool 'Mind Control Chip Bug' into their brains."

"Wait!? Stop that, Misha! That's a bad thing! It's the real deal!! No one wants that! Help meee—!?"

"Oh? There's no need to listen to the requests of prisoners, right? Plus, I have a demand. A girl who is mind-controlled and obedient is erotic, isn't it...? Now then, should we insert it through the ear or the nose?"

<b>

That's true, but!!

Nooo, don't bring that white caterpillar the size of a pinky finger closer to me—!?
