# The theory that Dungeon was a user of spatial magic

<blank>

I cleaned up a huge beehive.

I put it all neatly away in a storage space because maybe it could be material for something, but ...... Well, it looks like I got some honey, but what kind of honey is this? Where are the flowers blooming in this cave?　Oh man, is this a horror story?　Or is it a magical wonder?

<blank>

Incidentally, there was also an individual in the nest that I thought was a Queen Hornet, but, well, we usually eradicated it. Yeah. It can't be helped. But I'm sure it's the boss, and I'm sure it will come back. I'm sure. Probably. Yeah, I'm sure.

Anyway, after clearing out all the nests, we found our way deeper into the dungeon. As a matter of course, we went down and found ourselves in a forest.

A dense forest with only a few clear blue skies. The honey in the beehive must have been collected in this forest. Probably, probably. There are flowers blooming, too.

<blank>

What is ......, huh?

<blank>

That's funny. I was just in a cave, right?　And then I went downhill and went to ...... hmm?　Empty?

<blank>

If you turn around, there is a cave there. It's uphill from here.

However, if you turned to the side of that path, it was like a path connected by spatial magic, like a door that appeared anywhere, a cave exit that suddenly appeared. On the back side was a stone wall.

"Damn, are the spatial coordinates distorted?　Hey, the laws of physics! I can't speak for others either, but what's going on here? I can't speak for others either, but..."

<blank>

It looks like the door to the room of our base. Spatial magic: ......

Oh yeah, spatial magic?　The theory is that Dungeon was a user of spatial magic!　I think there is. If demons use magic, I wouldn't be surprised if dungeons use spatial magic. Even dungeons are alive, I'm sure.

<blank>

"Then it's just 'it's a dungeon, that's how it is.' Okay."

<blank>

I decided to switch heads.

In fact, as a user of spatial magic, I can create similar places. I can even create a forest behind a dungeon. On the contrary, there may even be a theory that my storage space was a dungeon.

Well, it's a waste of time to think too deeply about these things. I am not a scholar, and there is no point in pursuing it.

<blank>

"But there's also a huuuuge sky. ...... Hey, what time is it?　How long have I been underwater?"

<blank>

Thinking back, I had taken a lot of time to follow Mr. Yellow and eradicate the beehive. It was already morning. Oh no, I had stayed up all night. I found myself getting sleepy.

Whew, a yawn comes out of me. I'm going to go home. Let's go home.

<blank>

I memorized where I was and made my way to the storage space.

I'll be back. See you.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, welcome back, sister Karina. How was it?"

I couldn't capture it in one night, so I'm going to bed.

<blank>

I went to my room without saying good-bye to Dia.

I slipped into the futon. Suya.

When I woke up, Isiah was under the covers in bed.

<blank>

Huh!　Oh, Isiah, why are you under the covers!"

"Heh, oh, good morning, Arji-sama. ...... Here is my room."

<blank>

What, huh?

I looked around the room and sure enough, it was Isiah's room.

Oh, that's funny, isn't it?　I went back to my room and slept in my room, didn't I?

<blank>

What the heck? I got the wrong room, ......?"

<blank>

I, a master of spatial magic, mistook the left for the right in my sleep. ......　What a blunder!

<blank>

Yesterday, when I was sleeping, a certain master wandered in, and I thought he was going to give me his favor, but he fell asleep.

'Uh, yeah, sorry, wrong room. Yeah."

The master is always welcome."

<blank>

I'm the one who should have noticed it in the interior or something. I must have been very sleep-deprived. I must sleep properly.
