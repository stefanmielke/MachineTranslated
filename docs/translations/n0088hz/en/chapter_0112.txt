# The Theory That the Dungeon Was a User of Spatial Magic

<b>

I cleaned up a huge beehive.

I stored everything neatly in my storage space, thinking it might become some kind of material... Well, it seems like I also got some honey, but what kind of nectar is this? Where are the flowers blooming in this cave? Oh no, is this a horror situation? Or is it the mysterious power of magic?

<b>

By the way, there was a specimen that seemed to be a queen hornet in the nest, but I just exterminated it normally. Yeah. It couldn't be helped. But it must be a boss specimen, so it will probably revive again eventually. Surely. Maybe. Yeah.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, after cleaning up the entire nest, I found a path leading deeper into the dungeon. Naturally, as I went down, it turned out to be a forest.

A densely overgrown forest where only a little bit of the clear blue sky was visible. The nectar found in the beehive must have been collected from this forest. Surely, probably. There are flowers blooming too.

<b>

<b>

...Wait, what?

<b>

"That's strange. I was in a cave just now, right? And then I went down a slope... Huh? The sky?"

<b>

When I turned around, there was the cave. From my perspective, it was an uphill slope.

However, when I moved to the side of that path, it was like a door that appeared suddenly, connected by spatial magic, like a door that can appear anywhere, the exit of the cave. The backside was a stone wall.

<b>

"Is the spatial coordinate distorted? Hey, physical laws. Well, I can't really talk, but what's going on here? No, really, I can't talk either."

<b>

It was just like the door to my base's room. Spatial magic...

So, is it spatial magic? The theory that the dungeon was a user of spatial magic! I believe it. If monsters can use magic, it wouldn't be strange for the dungeon to use spatial magic as well. The dungeon is surely alive.

<b>

"Then it's fine to say 'it's like that because it's a dungeon.' Alright."

<b>

I decided to switch my mindset.

In fact, if I am a user of spatial magic, I could create a similar place. I could even create a forest deep within the dungeon. Conversely, there might even be a theory that my storage space is the dungeon.

Well, overthinking this is a waste of time. I'm not a scholar, and there's no meaning in pursuing that.

<b>

"Still, there's a normal sky too... Wait, what time is it now? How long have I been down here?"

<b>

Looking back, I had spent quite a bit of time tailing Yellow-kun and exterminating the beehive. It was already morning. Oh no, I pulled an all-nighter. Before I knew it, I was starting to feel sleepy.

A yawn escaped me. Yeah. I should head back for now.

<b>

I memorized my current location and opened a path to my storage space.

I'll come back again. See you later.

<b>

<b>

"Oh, welcome back, Karina Onee-san. How was it?"

"I couldn't clear it in just one night, so I'm going to sleep."

<b>

I quickly returned to my room, not bothering much with my greeting to Dia-kun.

I snuggled into my futon. Zzz...

<b>

When I woke up, Aisia had crawled into my bed.

<b>

"Fuh!? Ah, Aisia, why are you in my futon?!"

"Hehe, ah, good morning, my master... This is my room."

<b>

What, really?

Looking around the room, it was indeed Aisia's room.

Huh, that's strange? I went back to my own room and slept in my own room, right?

<b>

"Mm-mm-mm, what a thing. Did I mistake the room...?"

<b>

For me, a user of spatial magic, to mistakenly confuse right and left while half-asleep...! What a blunder!

<b>

"Yesterday, while I was sleeping, my master wandered in, and I thought I would receive your affection, but you fell asleep soundly instead."

"Ah, yeah, sorry, I mixed up the rooms. Yeah."

"My master is always welcome."

<b>

I think I should have noticed with the interior or something. I must have been really sleepy. I need to make sure to get proper rest.
