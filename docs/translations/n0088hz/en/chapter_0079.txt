# Oh it is like the wise men of old

(I accidentally posted two stories yesterday when I made the mistake of booking and submitting them...!)

Isiah's throat, which had adjusted to a wrinkled old man's voice, is restored to its original state.

Only the vocal cords are copied and stored in a separate space so they can be easily adjusted.

<blank>

I was so impressed that you could earn so many gold coins so easily!　It's just like you to earn so many gold coins so easily!

I'm amazed that Isiah was able to follow the script, especially with the spell chanting!　Great, great."

I'm a bard, so I'm good at remembering words.

<blank>

Ah. Come to think of it, I was so buoyed by the five gold coins that I forgot to get the additional brokerage fee.

I'll have to claim it the next time I go there... ...... No, I was shaking with the high bill of 5 gold coins, should I just pretend to shrug it off and forget about it?　Hmmm. But they originally said they'd pay it, so I can have it, right?　Yeah, I told you that I'd remember. If I remember.

<blank>

I think that amount is just the right price to put on top of the slaves."

Yes, you are right!　I am sure everyone will thank you!"

Hey, hey, that's where Mr. Healer, played by Isiah, takes it all, good and bad."

Haha, yes it was!　I awefully accept!"

<blank>

Damn, this all-affirmative praise is getting to be a habit!

I wonder why I can see dog ears and a tail even though Isiah is not supposed to be a beast. ...... I should make her a dog ear hair band and a dog tail next time. I'm sure they'll look great on her.

<blank>

"Wow, sister, did you earn that much gold?"

Yes, you have made a lot of money!"

I'm going to be able to continue to earn gold coins in the future. Now I won't have to worry about living expenses!"

You separate it from your income as a shonin, don't you?" So how much did you charge for your treatment?"

Five gold pieces per person, flat rate."

...... does that mean 5 gold coins for a condition like Isiah's too?"

'Yes, I think that's about the upper limit. I think that's about the upper limit, considering it's on top of the original price of the slaves."

<blank>

Even if it's just a missing finger, it's a flat five gold coins.

Even the ones that can be easily healed are going to be squeezed to the limit, for the same amount of money as a serious injury. Hmph.

<blank>

"...... I see!　That's your sister Karina, I admire her!"

<blank>

Dia-kun looks up at me proudly with sparkling eyes saying so.

They respected me. Hehehe. I'm such a genius.

<blank>

So, Mr. Deere, I will return the one gold coin that was owed to me.

Yes, I'll take it. I'll take it."

And the healer's earnings will pay for everyone's living expenses!　And we'll buy new beds!"

I am so proud of you," he said!　Amazing!

<blank>

Isiah, you don't seem to know the half of it!　But good!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Isiah, but I've made him hide his face and body when he works as a healer, so I can have him work as a bard in his spare time.

The money I got in that way was to be used as an allowance for Isiah, in the direction of letting him buy whatever he wanted.

<blank>

Come to think of it, how was Isiah a bard?"

I used to play in adventurers' guilds and bars. Basically, I play the lute, but I can also play any instrument.

<blank>

A lute, like an old guitar?

Is there usually the same one in this world ...... or is it a case of bringing in a transferee?　As well as public bathhouses.

<blank>

Can you play any instrument?　That's great."

If it behaves the same and sounds the same, I can play the rest by feel. I'm a bard."

<blank>

Bards are amazing. I'd have my fingers crossed ...... No, I wonder if this is a bard skill or something. I'm sure there is. Oh, well, it's a different world. Then maybe I'll be able to handle an instrument with my skills?

If you could play the piano, you could play that song on the piano, couldn't you?

Oh man, I want a musical instrument.

<blank>

I could have played the flute, but with a flute you can't sing. Did you know that?"

'Yeah, that's usually the case. It's a mouthful."

You are wise, aren't you?　Oh, it's just like the wise men of old!

<blank>

Could it be that Isiah is an idiot?　No, or is she playing the fool on purpose to lift me up?

<blank>

Oh. Oh, by the way, is that hand movement okay?　I'm moving it normally, as far as I can see."

Yes!　I am completely fine now!　Your treatment is perfect!

<blank>

I was thinking that I might need rehab for a few months or something, but they say I'm already good to go.

It's not that my muscles are weak, my nerves are not severed, my skin is not sticking out, and my brain hasn't forgotten how to move my hands. ......

It all fits together like the pieces of a puzzle, that's why it works normally. ...... It's quite a treatment, even for me.

<blank>

I can't do it like this. I can't stay like this. I must compose a song in honor of the master!　May I go back to my room?"

Oh, yeah." ...... No, I don't want a song honoring me, okay?　Maybe if you make a song honoring Mr. Healer instead."

Then I praise the healer as if he were a certain Lord!　Oh, that's an act of God!

<blank>

Then Isiah ran to his room.

<blank>

"Whew. Dear. What do you think, Isiah?　Is this an act of adoration for me?"

No, that was serious. There's no doubt about it."

<blank>

If you say so Deere, it seems to be OK for now, right?
