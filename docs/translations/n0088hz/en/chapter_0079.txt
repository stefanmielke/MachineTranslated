# Oh, that is like the ancient sage

(Yesterday, I accidentally posted two chapters due to a reservation mistake...!)

Returning Aisia's throat, which had been adjusted to the voice of a hoarse old man, to its original state.

Since the vocal cords are copied and saved in a separate space, adjustments can be made easily.

<b>

"Master, it went well! To earn so many gold coins so easily, as expected of you, Master!"

"You did well following the script too, especially the spellcasting! Great job!"

"Being a bard, I'm good at memorizing words!"

<b>

Ah. Speaking of which, I got so carried away with the five gold coins that I forgot to ask for the additional intermediary fee.

I need to request it next time... No, I was trembling at the high charge of five gold coins, so should I pretend to be oblivious and forget it? Hmm. But they originally said they would pay, so it's okay to take it, right? Yeah, I’ll make sure to mention it if I remember.

<b>

"I think that amount is just right to add on for a slave."

"Yes, as you say, Master! I'm sure everyone will be grateful to you!"

"Hey, hey, that's where Aisia, playing the healer, should receive everything, good or bad."

"Ah, that's right! I humbly accept!"

<b>

Ugh, this complete affirmation and praise is becoming addictive!

What is it? Aisia shouldn't be a beastman, yet I can see dog ears and a tail... Should I make her a dog ear headband and a dog tail next time? It would definitely suit her.

<b>

"Wow, did you earn that much gold, big sister?"

"That's right! Master earned a lot!"

"Hehe, and we now have a prospect of continuously earning gold coins in the future. We won't have to worry about living expenses!"

"You'll separate it from your income as a shonin, right? So how much did you set the treatment fee at?"

"Flat rate of five gold coins per person."

"…Does that mean someone in a state like Aisia's also costs five gold coins?"

"Yeah. I think that's about the limit when considering it as an addition to the original price of the slave."

<b>

Even someone with a missing finger is a flat rate of five gold coins.

Even if it's something easily fixable, it costs the same as a serious injury, and I’ll squeeze them for all they're worth. Hehehe.

<b>

"…I see! As expected of you, Karina big sister, I respect you!"

<b>

Saying that, Dia-kun looks up at me proudly with sparkling eyes.

I've been respected. Hehe. I'm a bundle of business talent.

<b>

"So, Dia-kun, I'll return the one gold coin I borrowed."

"Yes. I'll accept it."

"And the healer's earnings will go towards everyone's living expenses! I'm going to buy new beds!"

"As expected of you, Master! Amazing!"

<b>

Aisia seems to understand only about half of it! But that's okay!

<b>

Although it's Aisia, when she acts as a healer, I made sure she hides her face and body, so it might be good to have her work as a bard during her free time.

The tips she earns will be her pocket money, allowing her to buy what she likes.

<b>

"By the way, how did Aisia perform as a bard?"

"I performed at the adventurer's guild and taverns, singing while playing. Basically, I use a lute, but I can play pretty much any instrument."

<b>

When you say lute, is it like an ancient guitar?

It seems that the same thing exists in this world... No, could it be something brought in by a reincarnator? Just like the public bath.

<b>

"You can play any instrument? That's amazing."

"As long as the same action produces the same sound, I can play it by feel. After all, I'm a bard."

<b>

Bards are incredible. I would get my fingers tangled... No, I wonder if there are bard skills or something. That seems likely. Speaking of which, this is a different world. Then I should be able to handle instruments with skills too, right?

If I could play the piano, wouldn't I be able to sing and play that song about 'if I could play the piano'?

Oh no, I'm starting to want an instrument.

<b>

"I could also play the flute, but I can't sing while playing it. Did you know that?"

"Yeah, that's normal. Your mouth gets blocked."

"You knew that, Master? You're so smart! Oh, that is like the ancient sage!"

<b>

Could it be that Aisia is a bit foolish? No, or is she pretending to be foolish on purpose to flatter me?

<b>

"Ah. By the way, are you okay with those hand movements? From what I see, you seem to be moving normally."

"Yes! I'm completely fine now! Your treatment is perfect, Master!"

<b>

I was thinking it might take a few months of rehabilitation, but it seems she's already fine.

...It's not like her muscles have deteriorated, nor are her nerves severed, nor is her skin tight, nor has her brain forgotten how to move her hands.

Everything is in place like puzzle pieces fitting together, so of course she can move normally... I must say, my treatment skills are quite impressive.

<b>

"Ah, that's right. I can't just sit here. I need to create a song to praise you, Master! May I return to my room?"

"Ah, yeah... No, I don't need a song to praise me, okay? But if you want to make a song to praise the healer, that would be fine."

"Then I will praise the healer as if they were you, Master!! Oh, that is the work of a god!"

<b>

With that, Aisia ran off to her room.

<b>

"Phew. Dia-kun. What do you think of Aisia? Is she acting like she admires me?"

"No, that's genuine. No doubt about it."

<b>

If Dia-kun says that, it seems there shouldn't be any problems for now, right?
