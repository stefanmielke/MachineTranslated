# Let's leave him alone.

So this is Isiah's hometown.

Yes, sir. It's a country cave!"

This is my first time in a Dwarf village, so I'm looking forward to it."

I have to be careful not to accidentally go back to my original size. The collar will choke me.

<blank>

Aisia's hometown, a dwarven village with no particular name.

<blank>

It was a cave that had been dug out of one of the rocky mountains like an anthill.

It is properly paved with stone bricks and does not seem to be a natural cave.

<blank>

The tunnel also serves as a mine," he said. We don't dig new tunnels near the houses, so we don't have to worry about collapses.

<blank>

The gentle ascent is probably to ensure oxygen.

I have heard that even in Japan, tunnels are built so that the center of the tunnel is a mountain.

<blank>

We disembarked from the magic car (we were originally at the base, so we were just dressed) and proceeded down the tunnels.

Aisia, who goes forward without hesitation, is followed by me, Dia-kun, and Arthur, who is an extra.

<blank>

A little further on, there was a door with iron bars to allow air to pass through, and a bearded dwarf as the gatekeeper.

<blank>

"Hmm, a customer. ...... What are you?　Are you a merchant?"

Brother!　Long time no see, it's me!"

I'm looking at you, isn't it?　You haven't changed, how are you?

<blank>

What a surprise, he was Isiah's older brother. Not uncle or father, but brother.

And Aisia with her crushed tone, that's fresh.

<blank>

"The sex difference is even greater than I thought, Dwarves."

Yes, I was surprised. I didn't realize that men and women could look so different."

Hmm?"　Elves and humans and ...... Hey, aren't you a little dragon!　What the heck, you're not going to go crazy, are you?"

It's okay, brother. Arthur is a quiet dragon. Here, say hello."

Nice to meet you!

<blank>

Arthur opens the word book page of "Hello" and shows it to me.

<blank>

Oh, oh!　Well, well, well, well. ...... Hey, I just talked to a dragon. I can brag about this to everyone."

I'm going to say hello to everyone now, so if you're going to brag, let it be about other people in the village. Oh, and I met Sati a little while ago. She was fine.

I wasn't worried about him. I was more worried that you might be cheated and enslaved.

<blank>

Yeah, that's a big hit. I'm a raving slave.

<blank>

I'm a slave, but they treat me well. It was pretty hard until Master bought me. ......"

'What, are you seriously a slave? ...... Uh, are those ladies over there your masters?"

Yes. Her name is Karina-sama. She's a very great master, and I think she could destroy two or three countries."

What the hell is that? I'm scared.

<blank>

Isiah?　Well, I mean, it's not like I can't do it, but why are you threatening your brother with me?

<blank>

If you ever disrespect the Master, I'll have you punished!"

Oh, oh." ...... Um, Karina?　Did you do something to my sister?"

"Well, ...... I only remember taking care of your wounds and taking care of your food and clothing, right?"

<blank>

I really don't have any idea.

When did you rise to such a level of loyalty, Isiah?

<blank>

Hey, can you tell everyone in the village in advance so that they won't be disrespectful? I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I'd like to know in advance so I don't have to worry about it.　Also, I've been treated well by an old man myself, so don't worry about me."

Oh, oh. I understand. Some of them might get angry because Isiah is enslaved. I'll make sure to tell them exactly what I'm going to do, so just wait a little bit.

Take care of it. Take care of it.

<blank>

Aisia smiles at her brother.

The brother of the gatekeeper gingerly entered the village.

<blank>

After witnessing this, Isiah smiled at us with his usual smile.

<blank>

I'm sure everything will be fine now!　If any problems arise, I will take care of them!"

I've been thinking about it for a while now. Isiah, wasn't he a very different character?"

It is only natural that the attitude of a respectful master and a blood relative would change."

<blank>

Well, that's true.

<blank>

But to be honest, I value you more than my family, so if there is any misbehavior, please don't hesitate to tell me, Sen, and I will correct or punish it!"

Hey, Dia," he said. Isn't Isiah a little tense?"

I'm sure she's really pumped up for her visit to her parents. Let's leave her alone."

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, the brother came back and greeted the village head first.
