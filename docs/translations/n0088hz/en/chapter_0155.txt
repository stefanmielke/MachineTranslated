# Let's leave her be

<b>

"Is this Aisia's hometown?"

"Yes. It's a rural cave."

"It's my first time in a dwarf village, so I'm looking forward to it."

"I have to be careful not to accidentally return to my original size. The collar will tighten."

<b>

Aisia's hometown, a nameless dwarf village.

<b>

It was a cave that had been dug into one of the rocky mountains like an anthill.

It was properly paved with stone bricks, so it didn't seem like a natural cave.

<b>

"It's also a mine. Of course, they don't dig near the residences, so there's no worry about collapses."

<b>

The gentle incline is probably for securing oxygen.

I've heard that tunnels in Japan are made so that the center is at the mountain.

<b>

We got off the magical vehicle (though we were originally at the base, so it was just for show) and proceeded into the mine.

Aisia moved ahead without hesitation, with me, Dia-kun, and the bonus Arthur following her.

<b>

After a short distance, we came across a door made of iron bars for ventilation, and there was a bearded dwarf acting as the gatekeeper.

<b>

"Hm, a guest... What are you? A merchant?"

"Hey, big brother! Long time no see, it's me!"

"Wait, is that Aisia?! You haven't changed at all, how have you been?"

<b>

It turned out to be Aisia's brother. Not an uncle or father, but a brother.

And Aisia's casual tone was refreshing.

<b>

"Dwarves have a more pronounced gender difference than I expected."

"Yeah, I was surprised. The appearance difference between men and women is quite significant."

"Hm? Is that a dragon? It's small, but isn't it a dragon?! W-what's going on? It won't go on a rampage, right?"

"Don't worry, big brother. Arthur is a gentle dragon. Here, say hello."

'Nice to meet you!'

<b>

Arthur opened his vocabulary page for "hello" and showed it.

<b>

"W-whoa!? This is quite polite... I just talked to a dragon. I can brag about this to everyone."

"You're going to greet everyone, so if you're going to brag, do it to people from other villages. Oh, and I met Sati a little while ago. She's doing well."

"Ah, I'm not worried about that guy. I was more worried about you getting tricked and turned into a slave."

<b>

Yeah, that's spot on. I'm currently a slave.

<b>

"I'm a slave, but I'm being treated well. It was pretty tough before I was bought by my master..."

"W-wait, you're really a slave? ...Ah, are those young ladies your masters?"

"Yeah. Her name is Karina. She's a really amazing master; she could probably destroy two or three countries."

"What's that? Scary."

<b>

Aisia? Well, it's not impossible, but why are you threatening me with your brother?

<b>

"If you show any disrespect to my master, I'll take care of you, big brother!"

"O-oh... Um, Karina, did you do anything to my sister?"

"Well... I only remember taking care of her wounds and looking after her food and shelter."

<b>

I really have no recollection of that.

When did Aisia's loyalty rise so much?

<b>

"Hey, can you let the villagers know in advance to not be rude to my master? Also, let them know I'm being treated well, so they don't worry."

"O-oh, got it. Some might get angry that Aisia has become a slave. I'll make sure to tell them, so just wait a bit."

"Thanks, please make sure of it."

<b>

Aisia smiled brightly at her brother.

The gatekeeper hurried into the village.

<b>

After confirming that, Aisia turned to us with her usual smile.

<b>

"Master, everything should be fine now! If any problems arise, I'll take care of them!"

"...Uh, Aisia, didn't you change quite a bit?"

"It's only natural for my attitude to change when dealing with a master I should respect."

<b>

Well, that's true.

<b>

"But honestly, my master is more important than family, so if there's any rudeness, please don't hesitate to tell me, and I'll correct it or take care of it!"

"Hey, Dia-kun. Isn't Aisia unusually high-spirited?"

"She's probably excited about visiting her family. Let's leave her be."

<b>

<b>

In any case, when her brother returned, we were to greet the village chief first.
