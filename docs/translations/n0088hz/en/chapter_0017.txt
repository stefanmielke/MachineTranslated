# Let's get the reward!

<b>

I'm Karina! I earned 48 silver coins in one day!

Out of this, 70% is my reward!! Wow, I might be able to join the Merchant Guild soon!

<b>

“...This is the delivery quantity of a large-scale lumberjack party.”

“Right? We’re surprised too.”

“It was really amazing. This might be the first time Blade's expression isn't exaggerated.”

“Oh, did you think so too, Shildon? Me too.”

<b>

The seniors gaze into the distance. The receptionist is calculating how much 70% would be... 

<b>

Please give me my reward. Hurry up.

<b>

“For now, Karina. You get 4 large silver coins.”

“Eh? Wait a minute, senpai. My share is 33 silver coins and 6 large copper coins, right? The monsters I hunted on the way should offset the cart fees, right? Isn’t that quite a lot?”

“...Are you asking if you can get more? It’s my pride as a senpai... damn it! You’re going to be a big shot! I guarantee it!”

“Thanks a lot!”

<b>

It seems it’s not a calculation mistake.

Then, I guess I’ll take it without hesitation. It’s also a duty of a junior to uphold the senior’s face.

<b>

<b>

“Then, I’ll withdraw 25 silver coins for the Merchant Guild registration fee.”

“Since we are partnered with the Merchant Guild, it’s fine as it is.”

<b>

There are quite a number of traveling merchants and adventurers, and it seems they are partnered too. That’s convenient.

<b>

“And, I’ll process your rank-up. Congratulations, you are now E-rank.”

“Eh, rank-up? Yay! I’m already shedding my newbie status. ...But it’s only been 3 days since I registered, right? Is that okay? What’s the criteria?”

“If you earn 1 large silver coin in a month, you become E-rank. The standard is an income that allows you to live.”

<b>

I see, then since I earned 4 large silver coins in one day, I have no complaints about the rank-up.

To become D-rank, you need to earn 2 large silver coins a month, but you also need a period of activity, and from C-rank onwards, various requests must be fulfilled, and credibility comes into play, so it’s not something I can achieve immediately.

<b>

“Considering that, it seems Blade-senpai and the others are really solid adventurers, huh?”

“What’s that? Doesn’t it look like we’re solid from any angle?”

“No, at first, you seemed drunk and getting involved with us, right? Right?”

<b>

Blade-senpai stumbles over his words.

<b>

“...Hey Karina, are you really going to become a merchant?”

“Of course! Thanks to Blade-senpai, I might become a merchant much earlier than planned! I’m so grateful!”

“Oh, you’re welcome. I was thinking of formally inviting you to our party if you’re okay with it, but that’s probably impossible. We’re not enough for what we saw today.”

<b>

How serious. 

It would have been more interesting if he were the type to exploit clueless newbies.

Not quite like a god, but something like a “here you go” event to punish them.

<b>

<b>

“Oh. By the way, senpai. How many silver coins do I need for drinks at Shunrai-tei?”

“Hm? What? Are you going to meet Haru-nee? ...Just be careful not to get stripped again, okay?”

“If you want, I can treat you guys as a thank you?”

“Don’t be stupid, if you’re going to be a merchant, don’t waste money. Besides, I’ve already received enough gratitude from today’s earnings. Don’t worry about it.”

<b>

Let me be cool, Blade-senpai laughs.

<b>

“Well, just be careful not to get involved with any weirdos. I’ve heard the merchant world isn’t as kind as us. ...But you should be fine, Karina.”

“Oh! Do you know? That’s called a flag.”

“A flag? I don’t get it.”

<b>

This is probably a flag for meeting a con artist once I become a merchant!

Well, even if I get tricked and lose money, I can manage with space magic! Hehehe!

<b>

“If you run into trouble, why not consult with nee-san? Since she’s the store owner, she should be part of the Merchant Guild.”

“Now that you mention it!”

<b>

I must definitely go meet Harumikazuchi-nee-san!!
