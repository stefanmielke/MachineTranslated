# We're getting paid, man!

I'm Karina!　I earned 48 silver coins in one day!

Seventy percent of this is my fee!　Oh no, I'm going to join the merchant guild as soon as I can!

<blank>

......That's a massive lumberjack party-level delivery count."

I know. ...... we're surprised too."

It was really great. I think this is the first time I've seen Braid's expressions that weren't exaggerated.

Oh, you think so too, Shildon?　Me too."

<blank>

The seniors with distant eyes. The receptionist, let's see, how much would 70% be ...... and she does the math.

<blank>

Please give me a reward. Come on.

<blank>

You will get your share of the four large silver coins. Four large silver coins are your share."

What?　Wait a minute, senior. My share is 33 silver coins and 6 large copper coins, right? The monsters I hunted along the way are offset against the cost of the cart, right?　Isn't that a lot?

I said, "...... I can't take any more of this. It's my intention as a senior. ...... Darn it!　You're going to be a big shot!　I guarantee it!"

Aaaaahhhh!"

<blank>

They did not make a mistake in their calculations.

Then, I'll take it without hesitation. It's my duty as a junior to make my seniors look good.

<blank>

<blank>

So, I guess I'll have to withdraw 25 pieces of silver for the registration fee for the Merchant's Guild."

We have a partnership with the Merchant's Guild, so we'll be fine as we are."

<blank>

There are quite a few peddlers and adventurers, and I hear they have a partnership. That's convenient.

<blank>

And I'll take care of the rank upgrade procedure for you. Congratulations, you are now rank E."

Up in rank?　Yay. I can't wait for the newcomers to get out of the ranks. ...... It's only been 3 days since I registered?　Is it good?　What's the criteria?

If you earn one large silver coin a month, you will be ranked E. That is the standard for earning enough to live on.

<blank>

Well, then, I earned four large silver coins in one day, and I was ranked up without question.

To become a D-rank member, you need two large silver coins per month, but you also need to be active for a certain period of time, and from C-rank, you need to accomplish various requests and have a certain level of credibility.

<blank>

When you think about it, Blade and his seniors were solid adventurers, weren't they?"

What the heck, how solid is that?"

I mean, at first you looked like you were drunk and getting involved with me. Right?

<blank>

Braid senpai is at a loss for words.

<blank>

...... Hey Karina, are you really going to be a merchant?"

Yes, that's right. Thanks to Braid-senpai, I'm going to become a merchant much earlier than I had planned!　I am so grateful!

You're welcome. I was thinking of officially recruiting you to our party if only you were willing, but, well, that's not going to happen. There aren't enough of us to go around today."

<blank>

What can I say, it's so serious.

It would have been more interesting if he had been more like, "I'm going to exploit newcomers who don't know anything.

Not as much as God, but an event that punishes you in a "yea" kind of way, you know?

<blank>

<blank>

Oh. Oh, that's right, senpai. How many silver coins do I need to pay for a drink at Shunrai Pavilion?

Hmm?"　What, are you going to see Miss Hal? ...... be careful you don't get groped again, okay?"

If you want, I'll buy you a round of drinks for the seniors, too.

If you're going to be a merchant, don't waste your money. I've already paid you back with what I earned today. Don't worry about it.

<blank>

Let him be cool," laughs Blade Sensei.

<blank>

Well, be careful not to get tangled up with strange people. I hear that the merchant world is not as friendly as ours. I'm sure ...... Karina will be fine.

Whoa." Do you know what it is?　That's called a flag.

"Flag?　I don't know.

<blank>

This must be a flag that I'm probably going to meet someone who looks like a scam artist when I become a merchant!

Well, even if they cheat me and take my money, I can still get by with spatial magic!　Hehehe!

<blank>

If you have any problems, why don't you talk to her?　If she owns a store, she must be a member of the merchants' guild.

If you ask me!"

<blank>

This is more and more I have to go see my sister Harumikazuchi!
