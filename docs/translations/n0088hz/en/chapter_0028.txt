# The Story of Adult Shopping

<blank>

I'm Karina. I just came back from talking to God!

God was still eh ...... or rather a pervert!

<blank>

......, I mean, I'm totally God's dependent.

"Colleagues?　What is it now? We are children of God from the moment we are born.

<blank>

Siesta smiles at me. Cute.

<blank>

...... have you been there the whole time?"

'You were talking to God, weren't you? It's only a few seconds over here. ...... Oh, and that book?"

Hmm?"　Oh, it's a catalog God gave me."

<blank>

I had the SP catalog in my hand.

<blank>

'Do siestas get these things too?　A reward from God."

I've always been paid in kind, so I've never received anything like this in a catalog. I've always been paid in kind, so I've never received anything in a catalog like this.

"In-kind: ......"

'It's mainly sweets. Are they not in that catalog?"

Oh, it's on there!　Wow, there's a lot of stuff in there."

<blank>

The menu listed a wide range of convenience store sweets that I have seen in Japan, as well as sweets made with otherworldly fruits.

<blank>

"Looks good normally, but the cheapest is 50 sp, the most expensive is 300 sp. sounds like a hassle in its own way. ......"

But you have to be a god to get them. Otherworldly Sweets."

'Indeed. This is fascinating. ......"

<blank>

I wonder what four of them would taste like, like one divine sweet.

Flipping through a catalog like that, one item caught my eye.

<blank>

<blank>

-- "Menstrual skip medicine (1 dose): 50 SP"

<blank>

<blank>

The description said it was a reward for skipping one monthly thing. 'If you use it in the middle of your period, your period at that time will end immediately. Recommended to use just before! The description said.

<blank>

...... I see, I was a woman now, wasn't I?

I mean, if it's in the catalog, that means I'm menstruating.

I don't know if I could possibly use these things.

<blank>

'Does Siesta use this kind of stuff?'

I'm a succubus, so I can control my menstruation and other things. I'm a succubus, so I can control my menstruation and other things at will."

<blank>

I like the species characteristics!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now, after my discussion with God, I knew I wanted one of the slaves.

It's a standard for otherworldly stories!　Cute slave girls and a lot of fun!　I want to do it!

<blank>

So I came to ask the senior braiders how I can buy slaves and how much they cost. Wow. Oseite senpai!

<blank>

Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, slavery ain't a good thing."

<blank>

A quick no-no!

<blank>

"You're breaking my dreams out of nowhere, Blade Senpai ......!"

"Because, you know, they're slaves.　No one likes to be a slave.

That's right.

<blank>

It would have to be a very perverted person.

<blank>

"At that point, well, you can assume they're all trying to get out of slavery. Do you understand me so far?"

I see, you're back to being a civilian.

<blank>

If I could, I would go back to being a normal person. Yeah, that's what a normal person would think. Of course.

<blank>

'At this point, slaves are not to be trusted. Some slaves work diligently to gain their masters' trust, but think of it all as an act. Never trust them. The only time you can trust them is after the reckoning is over and they have returned from being slaves to being ordinary people."

What? Why?"

Many of them change as soon as they are no longer slaves. For example, here is a story.

<blank>

~~~~~~

<blank>

Slave, let's get married!"

'Glad ......!　But master. Slaves can't get married. ......"

'Then I release you!　Now you're no longer a slave and we can get married!　Now--"

I'm out of slavery!　I'm out of slavery, ah!　Ah, who would like to sleep with a (pee-pee-pee) bastard like you?　You're a shady guy who can't even talk unless it's to a lower-ranked person!　It was hard for me to act every time!　Abayo!　In addition, I'll take everything you've given me as a consolation prize!　I know it's in bad taste, but if I sell it, I can make a little money. Gahahahahaha!"

<blank>

~~~~~~

<blank>

I was cheated out of all my money, just like that.

Shildon-senpai!　Are you serious?

"Don't gouge ...... gouge ...... old wounds, Blade ......!　That'll work on me ......."

I'm going to make a story about it for the rest of my life. I'll use it as a story for the rest of my life."

<blank>

The experience, wow.

Incidentally, I heard that in reality, they were catfighting for a few days after being released, carefully transferring the money items to themselves as if they had ownership of them, so as not to violate the law, and legally taking all they could.

Eh, egyo.

<blank>

I let him study, and he learned how to do bad things without committing crimes."

And I treated his wounds with expensive potions, and we've been together for three years.

I'm not sure how much I'm going to be able to do!　Shildon-senpai, that ...... don't you?"

I thought you were a pampered, neat and tidy ...... gusun."

I'm glad Shildon's savings were enough to save us," he said. But he took all the money we saved for our wedding.

Aaaaahhhh!"

<blank>

I didn't expect Shildon senior, who has excellent defensive skills, to take so much damage. ......

Not physical, but psychological damage. This is terrible.

<blank>

"Yes, look Carina ......, if you see a good looking female slave, think he's a crook ......!"

"......Well, Shildon senior, I'll keep that in mind! I'll keep that in mind!"

<blank>

To the senior Shildon, salute!

<blank>

And well, as you can see from Shildon, it's super hard to be 'adored because you think you're well-liked, and then you're hated with all your heart. If you're going to be a pet, be prepared to be betrayed.

Just leave me alone already: ......"

<blank>

Gusagusa and Blade senior who keeps stabbing with a knife of words. The kicking of the corpse is terrible.

<blank>

'Ssekko senpai. Slaves have no dreams or hopes. ......"

'Yes, Karina. Slaves cost money and have more responsibilities. It is not something to be bought casually.

<blank>

In addition to the purchase cost, it costs money to take care of them with food, lodging, clothes, and whatnot.

Management responsibility also increases, and if a slave runs away and commits a crime, the master is said to be responsible.

<blank>

It is said that some slaves take advantage of this to ruin masters they don't like, and then return to the slavers and wait for new buyers. What is this master mess? Scary.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, even so, having a slave is an option if you're a soloist."

<blank>

Oh?　The story's changing, isn't it?

<blank>
