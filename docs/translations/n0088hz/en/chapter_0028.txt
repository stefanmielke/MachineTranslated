# A Story About Adult Shopping

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. I just came back from talking to the god!

The god was as lewd as ever... or rather, a total pervert!

<b>

“...I mean, I’ve completely become a servant of the god, haven’t I?”

“Fellow? What are you talking about? We’ve been children of the god since the moment we were born.”

<b>

Siesta smiled sweetly. So cute.

<b>

“...Have you been there the whole time?”

“You were talking to the god, right? It was only a few seconds here... Oh, what’s that book?”

“Hm? Oh, it’s a catalog I got from the god.”

<b>

In my hand was an SP catalog.

<b>

“Did you get something like this too, Siesta? A reward from the god.”

“A reward, huh? I always receive the actual items, so I’ve never gotten something like this catalog.”

“Actual items...”

“Mainly sweets. Isn’t that catalog listing them?”

“Oh, it is! Wow, there are so many kinds.”

<b>

The menu included a wide range of sweets, from convenience store treats I had seen in Japan to sweets made with fruits from another world.

<b>

“They look delicious, but the cheap ones are 50 SP, and the expensive ones are 300 SP. It seems like it would be quite a hassle...”

“But you can’t get them without the god. Otherworldly sweets.”

“True. This is appealing...”

<b>

I wonder what kind of taste the sweets that cost four of them for one divine artifact would have.

As I flipped through the catalog, my eyes caught on a certain item.

<b>

<b>

――“Menstrual Skip Drug (1 use): 50 SP”

<b>

<b>

Looking at the description, it was a reward that allowed you to skip that monthly occurrence once. It said, “If used during menstruation, it will end immediately. It is recommended to use it just before!”

<b>

...I see, I’m a woman right now.

I mean, the fact that it’s in the catalog means I have a period.

I might end up using something like this.

<b>

“Do you use something like this, Siesta?”

“Oh. I’m a succubus, so I can manipulate my period freely.”

<b>

Being able to manipulate it is nice!

<b>

Well, after talking with the god, I thought I really wanted at least one slave.

It’s a staple of otherworldly stories! I want to have fun with a cute slave girl!

<b>

So, I came to ask Blade-senpai and the others how to buy a slave and how much it would cost. Yay! Please tell me, senpai!

<b>

“Don’t do it, don’t do it. Slaves aren’t a good thing.”

<b>

A quick rejection!

<b>

“You’re crushing my dreams right away, Blade-senpai...!”

“Because, you know? They’re slaves. First of all, no one would willingly become a slave.”

“That’s true.”

<b>

Unless they’re a huge pervert, it’s an impossible story.

<b>

“At that point, you can assume that everyone is trying to escape slavery. Do you understand this much?”

“Escape from slavery... I see, it’s returning to being an ordinary person.”

<b>

If possible, I want to return to being an ordinary person. Yeah, I think that normally. It’s only natural.

<b>

“At this point, you can’t trust slaves. There are slaves who work hard to gain their master’s trust, but you should think of it as all acting. Never trust them. The only time you can trust them is after the settlement is done and they’ve returned to being ordinary people.”

“Eh, why?”

“Once they’re no longer slaves, many of them change drastically. For example, there’s this story.”

<b>

～・～・～

<b>

“Slave-chan, let’s get married!”

“I’m so happy...! But, Master, slaves can’t get married...”

“Then I’ll free you! Now that you’re no longer a slave, you can get married! Come on—”

“Yesss!!! I’m free from slavery! Ah, who would want to sleep with a (beep) like you! I can’t even have a decent conversation with a loser like you! It was a pain to act every time! Bye! And I’ll take everything you gave me as gifts, including the compensation! My taste is bad, but I can sell it for some money. Hahaha!”

<b>

～・～・～

<b>

“That’s how I got completely scammed and lost all my money, that’s Shildon over there.”

“Shildon-senpai!? Seriously!?”

“...Guh... Don’t dig up old wounds, Blade...! That hurts me...”

“Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused me with that? I’ll make it a lifelong joke.”

<b>

A personal experience, huh, wow.

In reality, it seems that after being freed, they pretended to be a cat for a few days and carefully transferred valuable items to themselves in a way that didn’t break the law, legally taking everything they had.

E-evil.

<b>

“I wanted to study, and I learned how to commit crimes that wouldn’t be considered crimes.”

“And I treated their wounds with expensive potions, and we were together for three years.”

“Sekko-senpai, please stop piling on the pressure! Shildon-senpai, um... Don’t mind?”

“I thought she was a sweet and innocent girl... *sniff*”

“Well, Shildon’s savings saved me. All the savings we had for our wedding were taken, though.”

“Aaaaaaaah!!!”

<b>

To think that Shildon-senpai, who has excellent defense, would take this much damage...

It’s not physical damage, but mental damage. This is terrible.

<b>

“L-listen, Karina... If you see a good-looking female slave, think of her as a scammer...!”

“...Understood, Shildon-senpai. I’ll keep that in mind!”

<b>

Salute to Shildon-senpai!!

<b>

“As you can see from Shildon, it’s super tough to think ‘I thought I was liked and was being pampered, but I was deeply hated.’ If you’re getting a pet, be prepared for betrayal.”

“Just leave me alone...”

<b>

Blade-senpai keeps stabbing with the knife of words. This is brutal.

<b>

“Sekko-senpai. Slaves have no dreams or hopes, huh...”

“That’s right, Karina-chan. Slaves cost money and come with responsibilities. They’re not something you buy casually.”

<b>

In addition to the purchase cost, there’s food, lodging, clothes, and other expenses to take care of them.

The management responsibility also increases, and if a slave escapes and commits a crime, the master is held responsible.

<b>

It seems there are slaves who use this to ruin masters they don’t like and return to the slave trader to wait for new buyers. What kind of master gacha is that? Scary.

<b>

<b>

“Well, even so, for you as a solo, having a slave is an option.”

<b>

Oh? The flow of the conversation is changing, isn’t it?
