# Well, of course I'm going to return it!!

<b>

Cha-ching, purchased for 750 SP. Remaining balance 1250 SP.

<b>

...I, uh, effectively earned 250 SP.

<b>

<b>

So, I quietly stored the tapestry in my base room and returned to the church.

Thanks to the miracle performed by God, it was quite bustling.

<b>

"Oh, fellow. ...I've been waiting for you, I demand an explanation."

"Huh? Ah—"

<b>

I was caught by Loli Siesta as soon as I woke up.

That’s right, it’s the bicycle-shaped energy-generating artifact placed by God.

<b>

What was in the room I was led into by Loli Siesta was indeed that, looking just like an aero bike. The height of the seat seems to be adjustable freely.

<b>

"...So, this is an artifact that can stop the world's collapse the more you pedal."

"Oh, I see. So that's how it is."

<b>

Apparently, the overflowing energy will likely lead to a bountiful harvest in the vicinity.

<b>

"So, it's an artifact of repentance and abundance. ...It seems like it would be easy to make sinners pedal."

"I hadn't thought of that."

<b>

It seemed like God wanted to mass-produce labor socks with this.

<b>

"I'll explain it as a semi-artifact granted as a reward for returning the artifact."

"Semi-artifact?"

"A remarkable tool that is on par with an artifact. Probably, like the socks, the same artifact will increase."

<b>

In essence, it's just an artifact.

<b>

"The name is... 'Foot-Pedaled Abundance.'"

"Huh, it had a name? I hadn't heard the name of the artifact from God."

"I just named it now."

<b>

Is Siesta in charge of naming artifacts?

<b>

"Hehe. I usually name the artifacts. It's a privilege of being a sister, an apostle of God."

"Oh, I see. By the way, what do you call the artifact that makes socks?"

"'Sock Sewing Machine.' This is also my naming, fellow."

<b>

Loli Siesta puffed out her chest proudly.

Hmm, I don't quite understand the naming conventions.

<b>

"...But, God intends to place artifacts in all towns that returned them, right?"

"That's right. Siesta's workload seems to be increasing."

"Don't worry about that, as my sock income will increase. More importantly, it seems like the return of artifacts will accelerate even more."

<b>

...Huh!?

<b>

Now that you mention it, just returning unused artifacts brings only honor and no real benefit.

If a proper reward is added to that—especially a useful artifact of abundance!

<b>

Of course I'm going to return it!!

<b>

Or I might even deliver artifacts that are on the borderline of whether I need them or not!!

It's like being able to trade the artifacts I have for an artifact of abundance!!

<b>

"Damn you, God! Not only did you ride on my idea, but you also made a move to further accelerate the returns!"

"From God's perspective, it seems they want us to deliver socks rather than artifacts."

"That sounds about right. God would probably say that."

<b>

<b>

Sigh... As I let out a sigh, I heard the adorable sound of little feet approaching.

<b>

"Hey, Kari-chan!! This wasn't what we discussed—!?"

"Oh, Mii-chan."

<b>

Mii-chan, pouting and slightly puffing her cheeks in anger, came over.

How did she find this place? Oh, could it be that there's some GPS-like thing in her hair accessory?

Oh my, does she want to stay connected with me all the time? How cute!

<b>

"Ah, um, can I explain? It wasn't me, it was God's doing!"

"God's? It was definitely more amazing than our meeting, but..."

"Actually, I just complained to God about it too."

"...Isn't that a bit too much to say?"

<b>

Well, that's between me and God.

In the end, I was the one who got roped in and forced to buy the tapestry.

<b>

"Huh? So that voice was really God's voice!?"

"That's right. Honestly, just barging in like that. Right, Siesta?"

"Yes. God was very pleased."

"W-wait, I-I was talking to God!? Oh my, I'm so surprised!!"

<b>

Mii-chan, nearly fainting from what Siesta said, I gently supported her.

<b>

"By the way, Lady Vermilion. I received a reward from God for returning the artifact."

"Eh, ah, Siesta-chan. I'm sorry for barging in... Wait, a reward?"

"Yes. Semi-artifact 'Foot-Pedaled Abundance.'"

<b>

And with that, Siesta promptly introduced 'Foot-Pedaled Abundance' to Mii-chan.

<b>

"What is that? How does it work!?"

"Well? But, it can't be disassembled."

"Hmm, let me pedal for a bit! I want to try it out and make some guesses!!"

<b>

Mii-chan's interest had shifted to 'Foot-Pedaled Abundance.'

<b>

...By the way, it seems that pedaling consumes quite a bit of stamina and magical power. Mii-chan was drenched in sweat after just a few dozen rotations.

This really seems like it could be used for repentance or punishment.
