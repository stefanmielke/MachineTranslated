# That's a good thing I'm giving it back!

<blank>

Chariot, 750 SP purchase. Balance of 1250 SP.

<blank>

I've earned 250 SP in real money from .......

<blank>

<blank>

So I quietly put the tapestry away in the base room and returned to the church.

It is quite crowded, partly because God has performed miracles.

<blank>

Oh, my dear colleague. ...... we've been waiting for you, and we demand an explanation."

Hmm?　Uh."

<blank>

As soon as I woke up, Lori Siesta caught me.

That's it, a bicycle-shaped energy-generating divine device placed by God.

<blank>

Loli Siesta took me by the hand and led me into a room where I found an aerobike that looked exactly like an aerobike. The height of the chair seemed to be adjustable.

<blank>

......, so this is a divine instrument that can stop the world from collapsing the more you row."

I was like, "Hohoho. I see."

<blank>

Perhaps the overflow of energy will result in a good harvest in the vicinity, he said.

<blank>

'So it's a penance and a fertility potion? ...... I guess we can make progress with the labor of having sinners row."

I never thought of that idea."

<blank>

God-willing, though, he seemed to want this to mass produce labor socks.

<blank>

Let me explain that it was a quasi-deity given to you as a reward for returning a sacred artifact."

Semi-divine?"

"It's just that it's an awesome tool that's equivalent to a sacred object. Perhaps, like the one in the sock, there will be more of the same divine artifact."

<blank>

In effect, it is just a divine instrument.

<blank>

It's called ...... 'Foot Paddling Fertility'."

"Oh, it has a name?　I didn't get the name of the sacred object from God."

I just put it on.

<blank>

Is Siesta doing the naming of the sacred objects?

<blank>

Hmph. I name most of the sacred vessels. It is the privilege of a Sister, an apostle of God."

'Hohey. By the way, what do you call the divine device that makes socks?"

It's a 'sock sewing machine. This is also my naming, gentlemen."

<blank>

Lori Siesta proudly boasts, "I'm so proud of you.

Hmmm, I'm not sure about the naming convention.

<blank>

...... But this is what God intends to place in all the towns that have returned their sacred artifacts, isn't it?"

I guess so," he said. Though it's going to be more work for Siesta."

'Don't worry about that, my sock income will increase. More importantly, it looks like I'll be returning the sacred objects at an ever-increasing rate."

<blank>

...... Ha!

<blank>

If you ask me, just returning an unused sacred object, then there is only honor and no real benefit.

What if a proper reward could be added to it - and a useful, fertility weapon!

<blank>

That would be returning it!

<blank>

Or even deliver a godly instrument that is just on the edge of not being needed!

It's like trading in your existing sacred artifact for a new one that will give you fertility!

<blank>

I said to myself, "Oh, dear God!　Not only did you get on board with my idea, but it was a move to further accelerate the return!"

I guess God wants me to deliver socks rather than sacred objects."

<blank>

I guess. God would say so.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, dear. As I sighed, I heard the sound of cute footsteps.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Kari!　This isn't what we discussed!"

"Oh, Mee-chan."

<blank>

Mee-chan came to me with an angry look on her face, puffing out her cheeks a little.

How did they find this place?　Oh, if it's something GPS-like in the hairpiece?

You want to stay connected to me?　That's so cute!

<blank>

I'm sorry," he said. Let me plead my case?　It wasn't me, it was God!"

God's?　It was certainly more awesome than our meeting, but ......"

'If anything, I've just complained to God myself.

...... Isn't that awe-inspiring indeed?"

<blank>

Well, that's where God and I get along.

Eventually I was rounded up or made to buy a tapestry, though.

<blank>

What?"　Then that voice is really God's voice!"

Yes, that's right. You just barge in on your own. Hey, Siesta."

Yes. God was very pleased."

I was like, "Wow, I just had a conversation with my God!　I'm so surprised!

<blank>

Mee is about to sit up when Siesta tells her too. I gently hold and support her.

<blank>

'Yes, Mr. Vermillion. God has rewarded me with the return of the sacred artifact."

Oh, Siesta. I'm sorry I came in without permission. ...... is your prize?"

Yes," he said, "I have a quasi-divine instrument. It's a quasi-divine instrument, the 'foot-row fertility'."

<blank>

And immediately, Siesta introduces "Ashiko-Futility" to Mee-chan.

<blank>

How does that work?

"Well?　But you can't dismantle it."

I'll actually try it out and guess!　I'll actually try and guess!"

<blank>

Mee's interest had shifted to "foot rowing fertility".

<blank>

...... Moreover, it seems to consume a lot of energy and magic power to turn the pedals. Mee-chan was drenched in sweat after just a few dozen rotations.

This is really going to be for penance or punishment.
