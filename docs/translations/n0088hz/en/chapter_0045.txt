# Elf Child ● With Illustrations

<b>

<b>

Human trafficking, well... it's one thing if they're legitimate slaves, but...

Children are...

<b>

Huh? But looking closely, the child is wearing nice clothes, so they don't seem like a slave.

No collar or anything, right...? So, could it be kidnapping?

<b>

"Ah... Are you okay?"

<b>

When I throw out a neutral question, the elf child flinches. Their silver ponytail sways along with them. Hmm, is it a boy? A girl? The outfit is shorts, but... this cute face. Hmm, I can't tell. But for now, they're definitely good-looking. Oh no, so cute.

<b>

"Can you understand me? Hello?"

"Uu...!"

<b>

Oh no, this child looks like they're about to cry. Wait, wait.

<b>

"Shh... The enemy might come."

"!"

<b>

I gently cover their mouth and say that.

Well, I mean, no enemies are coming. This is a storage space after all. But the elf child goes quiet just as I expected.

<b>

"Why are you in a place like this?"

"Um... I... my ship was attacked by pirates... I hid in a wooden box."

<b>

Ah, I see. They hid among the cargo and got taken away, then were stacked in the warehouse.

...Hmm, does that mean this elf child is the rightful owner of the cargo around here?

<b>

Ah, I can't rob someone like that!

I don't have a hobby of robbing children! Ugh! Is it always like this?!

<b>

<b>

From what I've heard, the attack happened about three days ago.

With cleansing magic and water magic, it seems they managed to survive in the box.

...Ah. Could it be that this is the "result" from that drinking contest day? This.

<b>

"Please, help my sister...!"

"Eh? You have a sister? ...So your sister is here! Alright, tell me more! Is she in another box? Oh, this box? Or a different one?"

"N-no! My sister... got caught by pirates to hide me...!"

<b>

Hmm, I see. They hid this child in the box, but they don't know what happened to their sister. From what they overheard, it seems she got captured by Gomez and the others.

And while hiding, they were brought into the warehouse, but then boxes were stacked on top and they got trapped.

<b>

...Hmm, at least it doesn't seem like the sister is among this cargo.

By the way, what's in the other cargo? I scan the area with spatial magic.

<b>

Cloth, clothes, alcohol, and maybe spices? Hmm, at least there are no people in there.

This one seems to be parts for golems? Probably spare parts from the Gomez Trading Company. Ah, can I take this? It's fine, right? I want golem parts.

<b>

...Well, it seems I'm lucky or unlucky, as this child happened to be in the very first box I opened.

But since I opened all of them anyway, it was just a matter of order.

<b>

<b>

Hmm. But, you know? If it's a ship with a permit, pirates are supposed to overlook it, right?

Does that mean this elf's trading company came without permission?

No, knowing Gomez, it's possible they ignored the permit and came from outside, so they "didn't come." Ship trading can be a gamble like that. (Refer to basic knowledge from a while ago)

<b>

But for now, what's important is one thing.

<b>

The fact that this child’s "sister" must be a beauty is undeniable! With those socks, I'm sure I can score high SP!

<b>

<b>

"I understand. I'll help your sister! ...By the way, are you a boy? Or a girl?"

"I-I'm a boy."

<b>

Tch! A boy! ...Wait a minute. If they're this cute, a boy might work too! The gods said it doesn't matter if they're a boy or a child! In fact, even from my perspective as a woman, this child is at a level that's totally okay... Hmm, hmm, cough cough. Well, since they're a child, I shouldn't make a move, right? Yeah.

<b>

Anyway! What's important is that it's all about the sense of shame. If I can somehow earn that sense of shame, I should be able to turn this child's socks into SP!

But... for a boy, how can I provoke that sense of shame...?

<b>

"...!"

<b>

And then I realize. The clothes in the wooden box are women's clothes!! This child has clothes in child sizes!!

This must be divine guidance! I've made up my mind!

<b>

<b>

I will turn this child into a cross-dressing boy!!!!!!!!!
