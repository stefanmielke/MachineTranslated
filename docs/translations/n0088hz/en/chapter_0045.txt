Human trafficking, though...if you're a legitimate slave... ......

Kids are... ......

<blank>

Hmm?　But if you look closely, you can see that they are wearing well-dressed clothes, so it's not like they are slaves or anything.

It doesn't have a collar or anything on it, does it ......?　So is it kidnapping?

<blank>

"Uh. I mean, are you okay?"

<blank>

The elf child trembled when I spoke to her. Her silver-haired ponytail shook as well. Well, is it a boy or a girl?　Is it a girl?　He's wearing short pants, but ...... this cute face. Well, I don't know. But at any rate, it's a beauty. Yikes, she's cute.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Do you understand me?　Hello?"

Ew... ......!"

<blank>

Oh, no, she's going to cry. Wait, wait.

<blank>

'Quiet. ...... the enemy is coming."

"Aha."

<blank>

Gently cover your mouth and stop saying so.

No, well, I don't have any enemies or anything coming in here. It's a storage space. But as I assumed, the elven boy is silent.

<blank>

How did you end up here?"

"...... and ...... I ...... hid in a crate ...... when my ship was attacked by pirates."

<blank>

Oh, I see. So it was hidden in a shipment, taken away intact, and stacked in a warehouse.

...... Hmmm...so does that mean that this little elf is the rightful owner of some of the cargo around here?

<blank>

Oh, you can't rob a place like that!

I ain't in the hobby of robbing kids!　Oh, man!　This is all you do, huh?

<blank>

<blank>

According to his story, he was attacked about three days ago.

I wonder if they were able to survive in the box in detail because of the cleaning magic and water magic methods.

...... Oh. I wonder if this is the "result" of that day when we were comparing drinks. Here it is.

<blank>

Please help my sister: ......!"

'Oh, you have a sister too? ...... You have a sister?　Okay, tell me more about it!　Is she in the other box?　Oh, this box?　Or another box?"

No, no!　My sister was ...... grabbed by pirates to hide me ......!"

<blank>

Hmmm...I see. I'm not quite sure what happened to my sister after I hid this girl in the box. From what I've heard of the conversation outside, it seems that she was captured by Gomez and the others.

He then said that while he was hiding, he was brought into the warehouse, but was locked in with boxes stacked on top of him.

<blank>

...... Hmmm, at least my sister doesn't seem to be in this package.

I mean, what's in the other luggage?　and scan it with spatial magic.

<blank>

Cloth, clothes, alcohol, spices, or this. Hmmm, at least there are no people in it.

Is this one a golem part?　Maybe it's a spare from the Gomesti Trading Company. Uh, can I have this one?　Can I?　I want it. Golem.

<blank>

...... Well, as luck would have it, this girl just happened to be in the first box I opened.

Well, I opened them all anyway, so it was just a matter of order.

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm. But you know what?　If the ship has a permit, the pirates will be let off the hook, right?

Are you saying that this elf's family's business association came here without a permit?

No, it's possible that Gomes ignored the permission and pretended that the ship "didn't come" because it came from the outside. Trading ships is a bit of a gamble. (See "Basic Knowledge").

<blank>

But, well, for now, one thing is important.

<blank>

Being her "big sister" means that she must be a beautiful woman!　And when it comes to her socks, they must be the ones that will surely receive a high SP score!

<blank>

<blank>

'All right. I'll help your sister out! ...... By the way, are you a boy or a　A girl?"

"Oh, man."

<blank>

Tsk!　Man! ...... No, wait. If she's this cute, she could be a guy!　God said. God said it doesn't matter if it's a man or a child!　I mean, I'm a woman now, and even to me, this girl is good enough to be a ...... nnGohuGohu. I'm a woman now, and I think she's a good enough girl for me.　I'm not sure.

<blank>

Anyway!　I've heard that what's important is the sense of shame. If we can somehow earn the sense of shame, we should be able to make this girl's socks into SPs!

But ...... man, how can I make you feel shame ......?

<blank>

"......!"

<blank>

And then I realize. The clothes in the crate, they are women's clothes!　That she also has clothes in children's sizes!

This, in other words, must be God's guidance!　I've made up my mind!

<blank>

<blank>

I make this girl a man's daughter. ！！！！！
