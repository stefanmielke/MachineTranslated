# Hit and Cover, Rock-Paper-Scissors!!

「「Hit and Cover, Rock-Paper-Scissors!!」」

<b>

The rock-paper-scissors played with that delightful rhythmic chant was exactly the same rule I knew, where victory and defeat were determined by rock, paper, and scissors.

After that, there were the half-spherical helmets and soft sticks made of rolled fur. The winner would hit the opponent's head with the stick for a win, while the loser would be safe if they could defend with the helmet.

<b>

It was a rule I completely knew. Well, there are public baths and all, so it's not surprising at this point.

<b>

"When undressing is added to the mix... I see... I see!"

<b>

Two beautiful women were engaged in a fierce battle from the first round.

Both were beastfolk resembling those with little fur, sporting the ears and tails of a black panther and a raccoon.

The two ladies initially wore relatively ornate clothing. As they stripped each other, it resembled the petals of a rose falling one by one. The difference was that with each layer removed, their allure and charm increased.

<b>

The struggle after rock-paper-scissors was rather poor. They seemed to lack enthusiasm, almost as if they wanted to undress more.

With a seductive smile, one lady began to take off her jacket—only to peel off a lace adornment from her arm and let it drop to the floor.

<b>

With each piece of clothing that came off, the eyes of the male spectators became bloodshot, and cheers erupted.

<b>

"Whoa, that's amazing... isn't it erotic?"

"Hey, Karina. Are you getting scared? Is it a bit too much for a country bumpkin like you?"

"No, I'm not a country bumpkin, okay? I have five wives."

"…Huh? Wives? And five of them... Seriously? Wow, you're something else...?"

<b>

Oh, Misha seems to be mysteriously flustered. You’re actually a virgin, aren’t you?

On the other hand, Dia was reacting like a virgin, shyly looking down.

<b>

"Dia, Dia, let's watch together! Look, that black panther lady is about to touch her underwear! She's going to show everything!"

"Hyah!? N-no, um! I-I’m fine!"

"Karina! Don’t bully Dia! This kid is a pure girl unlike you!?"

<b>

Misha hugged Dia protectively as if to shield him from me.

Wow, Dia is so cute, I can't help it. Besides, it was Misha who invited me to this tournament.

<b>

"By the way, those two are professionals brought in to spice up the tournament. They actually have a tendency to expose themselves and would participate in this tournament even without a prize. It also serves as promotion for the shop."

"Really? Which shop are they from? Can you request them?"

"Hey, hey. Are you actually a guy?"

<b>

I am. Good catch.

<b>

At that moment, a particularly loud cheer erupted. The raccoon lady had taken off her bra. While hiding the tips with one arm, she was lifting her chest.

<b>

And then, the match came to a conclusion. Huh? There’s still the bottom left, and she’s not completely naked, but the raccoon lady surrendered. The black panther lady acknowledged it, leading to the conclusion.

The staff covered the raccoon lady with a blanket to hide her body.

<b>

"Oh? Can you really surrender like that?"

"As long as the opponent acknowledges it, it's fine. Well, you can continue, but apparently, this level of exposure is more enticing?"

<b>

I see. As expected of the professionals. It’s like saying, if you want to see more, come to the shop.

<b>

"In the finals, it usually continues until they're completely naked! Hehe, I’m looking forward to stripping you down!"

"Isn't that Misha who’s going to be stripped? That outfit doesn’t seem to have much HP."

"Hehe! I have a secret plan!"

<b>

Misha said proudly. A secret plan? What kind of plan could it be...?

<b>

"Huh? By the way, Dia, if you look closely at that outfit, it doesn’t have many parts, does it? Here, take this as part of my secret plan. It’ll be good to attach a lot to your thighs."

"Eh, um, thank you."

<b>

Misha handed Dia a mountain of garter rings.

Bad news. The secret plan isn’t so secret.

Besides, even if I give that to him, he’ll face Misha in the second round, right?

<b>

"Isn’t that unfair? Give me some too."

"I’m not giving you any, you know!?"

"Oh? Is that okay? What if I lose before reaching the finals?"

"…I’ll lend it to you, but you have to win, okay!? Return it before the finals!?"

<b>

What? You’re actually lending it to me? You’re really kind.
