# Acts of Justice (Gomez Perspective)

(I've read all of your impressions, I'm sure!

I'm encouraged, thank you!)

(Gomez viewpoint)

<blank>

That woman got me drunk and I lost face.

So we must retaliate. This is an act of justice!

<blank>

<blank>

After the drinking contest, I had the commercial guild watch him until the next morning to identify the inn where he was staying, but he never showed up.

What does it mean that they had the back door guarded as well? Where the hell did he go, or did he just get away?

<blank>

'O-head!　I found that woman!"

Finally!"

<blank>

Just as I was getting frustrated and unable to give up, I received a report from my subordinate. I'm a lucky guy after all.

<blank>

Where the hell was that bitch?

It's a port. The other guy took you to our warehouse, so you should be at ...... by now."

Kukuku. I see. Because you're a woman and you're challenging me."

<blank>

Even if we catch him, he will be wounded, but we can heal him with some healing magic.

Fortunately, we have that kind of connections. We're not exactly pirates under the direct control of our lords.

<blank>

"It wouldn't hurt to cut the tendons in his legs and keep him on the ship," he said. Hey, go get the slaver."

I'm sure we can use it!　Heh heh, head, let us use it too."

When I get tired of it!　Gahaha!"

<blank>

I took light steps toward the warehouse where I caught that woman.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When we arrived at the warehouse, it was quieter than I had expected.

<blank>

Hmmm?　I thought it would be more exciting - and then I noticed my man lying at my feet.

<blank>

"An?　Did you get beaten up by resistance, you--no, you ...... et al?"

<blank>

And it wasn't just one person: three were lying on the floor, one was pinned to the ceiling, and five were covered in luggage, motionless.

<blank>

And there he stood, alone and unharmed.

<blank>

What is the meaning of this!"

<blank>

No, if you think about it. This woman turned the tables on our crew.

You don't think he was such a talented ...... magician?　I instantly changed my mind.

<blank>

"Hey you, you stole my warehouse!"

<blank>

Yes, that's right. This guy was a burglar who robbed my warehouse. He was trying to steal my stuff by taking out the guard's men in a cowardly manner!

If the other party is a robber, justice is on our side. Then all that remains is for me, who has been entrusted with independent discretion by my lord, to bring him to justice!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I said, "...... No?　I only came in here because these guys called me. I thought you wanted to see me."

I'm not going to let you get away with it now that I've witnessed it!　Now that I've witnessed it, you can't get away with it!"

"Oh, you really want to rob me?　Hmm."

<blank>

A smirking, laughing woman. What the hell, how can you afford that?

<blank>

Then I'll rob you!　Ha-ha-ha!"

What the hell?"

<blank>

A woman laughing out loud. Is she crazy?　No, she must have some kind of trump card, some kind of magic or something, that she has used on her minions. I open my legs and brace myself.

<blank>

Snap.

<blank>

I closed my eyes, and in the instant I opened them, there was nothing there anymore.

<blank>

What about ......?"

<blank>

No, it wasn't nothing. My minions were lying on their sides, and they were starting to get up.

However, all the cargo that had been in the warehouse was now gone, revealing a spacious floor.

The woman was gone too.

<blank>

What?　Huh?"

<blank>

The entire contents of my warehouse disappeared somewhere.

Robbery...... says this is a robbery!　What the hell does that mean!

<blank>

What the hell did you do?

<blank>

My screams echo through the empty warehouse.

No reply: ......

<blank>

Hey, Mr. Gomez. What's going on, this is not what we talked about.

I'm sorry. I don't know what's going on either. ...... Hey, you guys!　What the hell is going on!

Ugh, it moves. Oh, my head!　That guy, that monster."

Like we're fish in a net.

<blank>

The minions are making up excuses. But it doesn't change the fact that they have failed. And it doesn't change the fact that the woman disappeared along with her belongings.

<blank>

It's a load!　There's no way they could have taken that much luggage out in an instant!　It's got to be hidden somewhere!

You can't even hide it in an instant. ......

"Searching ！！！！."

<blank>

I'll have my guys search the warehouse.

<blank>

However - it was obvious that the empty warehouse had no cargo anywhere.

<blank>
