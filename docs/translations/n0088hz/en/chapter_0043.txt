(Gomez's Perspective)

<b>

I was humiliated by that woman, and my pride was wounded.

Therefore, I must take revenge. This is an act of justice!

<b>

<b>

After the drinking contest, I had my men keep watch on the commercial guild until the next morning to identify where she was staying, but she never showed up.

Even though I had them watch the back entrance, what on earth happened? Where did she disappear to? Did she manage to escape somehow?

<b>

“Boss! We found that woman!”

“Finally!”

<b>

Just when I was feeling frustrated and ready to give up, I received a report from my subordinate. I really am lucky.

<b>

“Where the hell is that bitch!?”

“At the port. Someone else guided her to our warehouse, so she should be there now…”

“Ha ha ha. I see. She’s just asking for it by opposing me, being a woman and all.”

<b>

Even if I catch her, she’ll be injured, but I can heal her wounds with some magic.

Fortunately, we have connections for that. I’m not just any pirate under the direct command of the lord.

<b>

“Cutting her Achilles tendon and keeping her on a ship wouldn’t be too bad either. Hey, call the slave trader.”

“Got it! Hehe, boss, let us have some fun with her too.”

“Only if I get bored! Hahaha!”

<b>

I headed towards the warehouse where that woman was captured with a light step.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When we arrived at the warehouse, it was quieter than I had expected.

<b>

Hmm? I thought it would be more lively—then I noticed my subordinate lying on the floor at my feet.

<b>

“Huh? Did you get beaten up trying to resist—no, you… all?”

<b>

And it wasn’t just one person. Three were sprawled on the floor. One was embedded in the ceiling. Five were piled under some cargo, not moving.

<b>

And one person, unscathed, stood there.

<b>

“What is the meaning of this!”

<b>

No, if I think about it, it’s clear. This woman has taken out my men.

Could it be that she’s such a powerful… sorceress? I immediately switched gears in my mind.

<b>

“Hey, you! You broke into my warehouse to steal, didn’t you!?”

<b>

That’s right. She’s a thief who broke into my warehouse. She took down my guards using underhanded tactics and was trying to steal the cargo!

If she’s a thief, then justice is on my side. Now, it’s up to me, who has been granted the lord’s discretionary power, to judge her!

<b>

<b>

<b>

“...No? I just came in here because they called me. I thought you had business with me.”

“Shut up, thief! Now that I’ve witnessed this, there’s no escaping the truth!”

“Oh, do you really want to label me a thief? Hmph.”

<b>

The woman smirked. What’s with that confidence?

<b>

“Well then, I’ll just steal from you! Ahahaha!”

“What did you say!?”

<b>

The woman laughed out loud. Has she lost her mind? No, she must have some trump card, like magic, that she used to deal with my men. I spread my legs and prepared myself.

<b>

Snap.

<b>

I closed my eyes, and in the instant I opened them, everything was gone.

<b>

“...Huh?”

<b>

No, it’s not that there’s nothing. My subordinates were lying on the ground, and they were starting to get up.

However, all the cargo that had been in the warehouse had vanished, revealing a spacious floor.

The woman had also disappeared.

<b>

“Eh? Huh?”

<b>

The contents of my warehouse had completely vanished.

A thief… is this what a thief does!? What is happening!?

<b>

“W-What did you do!?”

<b>

My shout echoed in the empty warehouse.

There was no response…

<b>

“Hey, Gomez! What’s going on here? This isn’t what we agreed on!”

“I-I don’t know! I have no idea what’s happening… Hey, you guys! What’s going on!?”

“I-I can move. Ah, boss! That monster…”

“She treated us like fish in a net…”

<b>

My subordinates began to make excuses. But no matter how many excuses they made, it didn’t change the fact that they had failed. And it didn’t change the fact that the woman had disappeared with the cargo.

<b>

“Damn it, the cargo! There’s no way she could have taken all that in an instant! It must be hidden somewhere!!”

“Hiding it all in an instant is impossible…”

“Search for it!!!!”

<b>

I had my subordinates search the warehouse.

<b>

However—there was no cargo anywhere in the empty warehouse.
