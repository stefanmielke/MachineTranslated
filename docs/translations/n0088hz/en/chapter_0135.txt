# You can't hold back, can you?

By the way, pirates used guns too, but they aren't really used by adventurers.

They don't work well against monsters with tough hides, and the bullets are small enough that unless you get a critical hit, they only cause wounds that can be ignored during combat.

<b>

"It's bad for a mutt to imitate humans. Well, even if it's a request, it was really unlucky for you to be here right now."

"Ugh..."

"Oh, I won't allow that."

"Ah, my potion—"

<b>

Masahiro kicked away the potion (a replica) that he had taken out and was about to drink, looking quite pleased.

<b>

"I've never liked you from the start, you beastman getting all cocky. After your bath, it's all fur, and if you get in there, you'll be covered in fur and dirty, you know?"

"Have you ever been covered in my fur? Did you sneak into the women's bath, you perverted bastard?"

"It's the men's bath! It's the fur of some old beastman I don't know, damn it..."

<b>

Ah, yeah, I can see why you'd feel terrible. Yeah...

<b>

"So, what do you want to do... ugh, it hurts."

"Me? I'm going to crush this dungeon! Do you know? Dungeons are like parasites that weaken the world. This is an act of justice."

"W-What did you say—ouch, that hurts."

<b>

Bibei spoke proudly like that.

That aside, Masahiro's reaction to the pain is way too exaggerated. How does he not get caught?

<b>

"Well, a beast's head wouldn't understand. My bad, my bad."

"By the way, that's just what the Gidlar Empire is saying on their own... Are you from the Empire?"

"Nope. I'm a mercenary from the Holy Nation. But once I finish this job, I'm promised the status of a hero in the Empire."

<b>

Wow, what a talkative guy.

Oh, by the way, the four party members seem to have decent sensibilities and are desperately trying to stop him, you know? I'm secretly keeping my whole body stiff, maintaining a situation where Bibei and Masahiro can talk alone.

<b>

"Ah, the Holy Nation... Isn't that the country famous for hating beastmen? So why is a mercenary from there acting like a puppet of the Empire in the Kingdom?"

"Huh?"

<b>

Provoked, Bibei kicked Masahiro's face.

<b>

"What?"

<b>

But, as expected, Masahiro didn't budge at all.

<b>

"Oh, hey healer. Don't stop me; I could have gotten more out of him."

"…Isn't it enough? I can't stand it any longer."

"You really can't hold back, can you... Well, fine. This guy doesn't seem to know much anyway."

<b>

Gently moving Bibei's foot away, Masahiro stood up while cracking his neck. And I lifted my body.

<b>

"It seems the four behind are holding more important information. This guy is just a guide, or maybe a decoy?"

"Huh, why are you unhurt—"

"Then, shall I make your mouth move for interrogation? ...Partial release."

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, I allowed the four to speak.

...Oh, the four are immediately trying to commit suicide. Not gonna let that happen, though?

<b>

"W-What?! You can't bite your tongue off?! What the hell is going on?"

"Gulp... huh?! The drug disappeared...?!"

"And I told you not to speak, Bibei!"

"(Mumbling...)"

<b>

I protected their tongues with spatial magic, and I've collected the drugs.

You won't die. I will protect you!

You shot my Masahiro. Don't think you can die easily?

<b>

"W-What did you do, Shirogane?! Ugh, what is this? I can't move?!"

"What do you mean? I'm not doing anything? Right, healer?"

"Indeed. I solidified them with my magic. It was me who did it."

<b>

By the way, I also made Bibei unable to move.

Well, there's no way mere humans or operatives can resist my spatial magic. Now, let's take our time with the interrogation.

I solidified Bibei until he couldn't speak and stuffed him into a storage space.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, let me ask you one thing... why is this man the leader?"

"「「「「……」」」」

<b>

The four didn't respond when I spoke to them. It's a bit lonely.

<b>

"If you won't say anything, I'll take out my frustration on this man because I personally find his actions infuriating. The leader's blunder is a collective responsibility for the whole party."

"「「「「……」」」"

<b>

Yeah. Seems fine.

Then, let's have these guys reflect on shooting or speaking ill of Masahiro.

<b>

...Oh, right.

If they're so determined to commit suicide...

Instead, just instead, huh?

<b>

<b>

Wouldn't it be nice to get points for "living shame" from their socks?

<b>

If I get good points, maybe I'll forgive them! Hehehe!
