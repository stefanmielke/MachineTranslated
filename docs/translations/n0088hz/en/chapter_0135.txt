# You're a hard man to put up with.

By the way, guns were also used by pirates, but not so much by adventurers, this one.

They don't work very well on hard-skinned monsters and the like, and the bullets are so small that one or two shots will only cause negligible wounds during a battle unless they are very critical hits.

<blank>

It's bad enough that the dog-pooh imitates the human. Well, it was really bad luck to be here now, even if it was a request."

Kuk ......"

Oops, I won't allow that."

"Oh, potion gar."

<blank>

Beebey is proud of kicking away the potion (duplicate) that Masirow took out and was about to drink.

<blank>

I didn't like it for a long time, you beastly creatures getting on my nerves. After your baths, there's so much hair that when I go in there, I'm covered in it and it's filthy, you know?"

You ever get covered in my hair?　Have you been in a women's bath, you pervert?"

It's a men's bath!　I don't know, man, it's the hair of the beast, damn it. ......"

<blank>

Oh yeah, that can be a bad feeling. Yeah ......

<blank>

"So, what the hell do you want to do ...... ugg, that's right."

Me?　I'm ...... going to destroy this dungeon!　Do you know?　Dungeons are like parasites that weaken the world. This is a righteous act."

What did you say?

<blank>

Bebay says so proudly.

Aside from that, Masilo's pain is too much of a stick. I don't know how they don't know.

<blank>

You can't understand in the mind of a beast, "What's Sorry, sorry."

"Oh, that's just something the Gidlaga Empire says on its own. ...... Are you from the Empire?"

No, I'm a mercenary of the Holy Land. I am a mercenary of the Holy Land. But when I finish this job, I am promised a heroic position in the empire.

<blank>

Wow, what a flippant and well-spoken man.

Oh, and by the way, the four party members are trying desperately to stop me from having any sane sensibilities, okay?　I'm sneaking around, full-body, and maintaining a place for Mr. Beebe and Mr. Masillo to talk alone.

<blank>

"Ah, the Holy Land. ...... It's a country famous for hating beastmen, isn't it? So how come a mercenary from there is a puppet of the empire in the kingdom?"

What about?"

<blank>

The agitated Beebey kicked Mr. Masillo in the face in the form of a stomp.

<blank>

Huh?"

<blank>

But, as a matter of course, Mr. Masiello did not make the slightest move.

<blank>

Oh, come on, healer. Don't stop me, I could have gotten a little more out of you."

"Have you had enough of ......?　I will not stand for this any longer."

"He ain't a patient man. ...... Well, that's okay. He doesn't seem to know much."

<blank>

Masilo lightly moves Beebe's bewildered legs out of the way with his hands, and stands up while snapping his neck. And then, I pick myself up.

<blank>

The four guys in the back seem to have more important information. Is this guy a guide or a decoy?"

How come you're unharmed?

'So shall the mouth work for the sake of interrogation? ...... partial release."

<blank>

I clap my hands and let the four of them speak.

...... Oops, the four of them tried to commit suicide as soon as possible. I ain't gonna let 'em, though, am I?

<blank>

"Nah, I can't bite my tongue out, can I?　What's going on?"

"Goku......mu!　The medicine is gone......!"

I mean, I told you not to talk, Beebey!"

(mumble-mumble ......)"

<blank>

I had my tongue protected and guarded with spatial magic, and I was able to retrieve the medicine.

You will not die. I will protect you!

You shot my Mr. Masiello. Don't think it's easy to die, huh?

<blank>

What are you doing, silver?　Ugh, what the hell, it's not moving!

What? I'm nothing?　Hey, healer.

Mm-hmm. My magic has made it hard. I did it."

<blank>

And while we're at it, we'll also make Beebey immobile.

Well, there is no way that mere mortals and operatives can resist my spatial magic. Now let's interrogate him slowly.

Harden the bebay to the point that it can't speak tick-tock, and then smash it into the storage space.

<blank>

<blank>

"By the way, I have one question for you guys: ...... why is this man the leader?"

「「「「......」」」」

<blank>

I talked to four people and they didn't respond. It's a bit lonely.

<blank>

If you won't talk, I'll take it out on you because I'm personally pissed off by this guy's behavior, okay?　The whole party is jointly and severally responsible for the leader's blunder."

「「「「......」」」」

<blank>

Yeah, I heard it's good. I heard it's good.

Well then, let's make these guys sorry for shooting at Mr. Masilo and saying bad things about him.

<blank>

...... Ah, yes.

If these guys are prepared enough to commit suicide, ...... the other way around, you know?

<blank>

<blank>

I wonder if these guys get points for "living shame" on their socks?

<blank>

If I get good points I'll forgive you!　Ugh!

<blank>
