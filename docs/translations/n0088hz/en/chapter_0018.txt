I’m Karina-chan. I came to ask my big sister Harumikazuchi about the Merchant Guild!

My big sister must be surprised that I quickly ranked up to E-rank and started earning money!

<b>

Talking with my big sister at the bar counter.

<b>

"I thought you came to work for us, but you’re doing well. What on earth did you do to earn that much as a new adventurer in just one day?"

"Well, I cut some trees with my seniors using magic."

"Oh, so you’re a lumberjack with magic, huh?"

<b>

My big sister’s ears perk up in interest.

Hehe, it’s okay to praise me a lot, you know?

<b>

"So, I thought I’d ask various things about being part of the Merchant Guild."

"Hm? Are you going to become a merchant? Not just earning money with the Blades?"

"I was originally thinking of becoming a traveling merchant. I want to make use of my special skills."

"If you can use such amazing magic, being a traveling merchant would be easy, huh?"

<b>

Yes, I can even teleport. I won’t say that much, though.

<b>

"That said, we’re not really a consultation office for that kind of thing, you know?"

"Please! You’re the only one I can consult, big sister Harumikazuchi!"

"…Well, I guess I can’t help it. I’ll give you a bit of advice since you came to Shunrai Tavern alone to drink."

<b>

Yay! Big sister is so kind!

<b>

"And also, I’d like to consult about what I should handle as a traveling merchant."

"That’s easy. Just ask the guild members, and they’ll tell you what products are in demand. They should let you know what items are lacking. They probably won’t tell you about really profitable products, but they won’t tell you about items that are huge misses or ones that get rejected for trade either."

<b>

Trade rejection. So that’s a thing.

<b>

"Rather, it’s safer to only handle the products you hear about from the guild at first. Even if it means a slight loss temporarily, it’s good to do it once as a way to give a gift to the predecessors. You can earn trust, which will benefit you later, and you should cut ties with anyone who casually recommends products that could lead to big losses."

"I see."

<b>

So it’s lucky that I found such people while I’m still a small-scale traveling merchant, huh? Well, my current capital is only what I can earn in a day as a lumberjack.

<b>

"…Oh, by the way, I remembered that I wanted something too."

"Sure, if you tell me where it’s sold, I’ll buy it in a flash!"

"Hahaha, it’s great that you’re so energetic, but ‘in a flash’ is a bit too much. Well, it’s lotion. If you can get it, I’d appreciate it. I’ll buy a bag of the powdered kind for one silver coin. But I won’t buy any low-quality stuff, okay?"

<b>

Oh, lotion! I need to stock up on that for the ladies working at this shop!

<b>

"By the way, how do you judge the quality?"

"You can tell by the taste. Good ones are mostly tasteless and odorless, but the bad ones taste bad, smell bad, and have a terrible texture. Well, even good ones can make you feel sick if you drink a lot."

<b>

I see. Taste, huh.

I tilt my mug filled with alcohol. The alcohol in this world is warm and has a low alcohol content, but it has a slightly sweet taste that I like.

<b>

"Whoa, let’s stop at just that one drink for today. You might forget everything I told you if you get too drunk, and that would be a waste."

"Huh? Ah, that’s true…"

"And if you’re going to join the Merchant Guild, make sure to keep your capital safe. I won’t hold back in taking it from you, you know?"

<b>

Taking it from me, huh? You say that while stopping me?

I couldn’t help but smile wryly at that overly kind remark.

<b>

After leaving Shunrai Tavern, I decided to head home.

However, I hadn’t booked a room, and I felt uneasy about relying on the church for two consecutive days. My home, of course, is my storage space.

<b>

Since I copied a blanket at the church, I can easily sleep in my storage space now. Hehehe.

<b>

That said, I didn’t want anyone to see me entering the storage space, so I wandered into a deserted alley. Ah, just one drink, but I can feel the alcohol a bit.

This body is young, and my alcohol tolerance is quite low… hiccup.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, little lady, this way is off-limits."

<b>

Huh? Oh, he’s calling me little lady.

I lightly bow my head and say to the man who spoke, "Oops, my bad," and turn back.

Then, another man blocked my way.

<b>

"You can’t pass unless you pay a toll here."

"Oh? Is that so?… then where am I supposed to go if it’s a one-way street?"

"Well, where could it be? Should I send you to heaven?"

"Ah, up, huh? Okay. Then I’ll be on my way."

<b>

I jumped up into the air.

Oh, I just realized that if I’m in the sky, no one can see me! What a great discovery!

<b>

…And so, I entered my storage space above the town of Sorashidore and spent the night there. Hiccup.
