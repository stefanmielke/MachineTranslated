I'm Karina. I've come to ask my sister Harumikazuchi about the Merchant's Guild!

I was promoted to the E rank and earned money immediately, which was a surprise to my sister!

<blank>

Me talking with my sister at the bar counter.

<blank>

I thought you had come to work for us, but you're good. How in the world does a new adventurer make that much money in one day?"

Well, the seniors and I cut a little wood with our magic."

"Oh, a lumberjack by magic."

<blank>

The sister's ears twitched with admiration.

Hehehe, you can give me one compliment, okay?

<blank>

So I thought I'd ask you a few questions about joining the Merchant's Guild.

"Hmm?　You're going to be a merchant?　Don't you want to make money with the blades?"

I was originally thinking of becoming a peddler or something. I wanted to make the most of my skills."

If you can use such amazing magic, peddling must be a breeze.

<blank>

Yes, we can even transition. I won't go that far.

<blank>

But we're not a counseling center, are we?"

I'll take care of that!　The only one I can talk to is my sister Harumikazuchi!"

I'll give you a little advice. I'll give you some advice, buying your spirit of coming to Shunrai-tei for a drink alone as a woman.

<blank>

I did it!　Miss kind!

<blank>

And also to consult with them about what they should handle in their peddling business."

Just ask the guild members. They will tell you what they want you to peddle and what you are missing. They won't tell you about the really profitable items, but they also won't tell you about the big losers or the ones they refuse to deal in.

<blank>

Refusal to deal. Is that what it is?

<blank>

It's safer to only deal in products you've heard about in the guild at first, and even if you lose some money temporarily, it's good to do it once as a souvenir to your predecessors. You can buy their trust, which will benefit you later on, and if they don't mind recommending a product that could cause you to lose a lot of money, cut them loose as soon as possible.

I see.

<blank>

You were lucky to find such people while you were a small-scale peddler even if you lost a lot of money. Well, the current source of funds is only what a lumberjack can make in a day.

<blank>

...... Oh, by the way, I remember we had something we wanted too."

'Oooooh, tell me where you sell it and I'll buy it in seconds!'

'Ha ha ha, I'm glad you're feeling better, but seconds are an exaggeration. Well, it's lotion, but if you can stock it, please do. I'll take a bag of powder for about a silver coin. But I won't buy the bad stuff, okay?"

<blank>

Oh, lotion!　I'll have to stock up on that for the ladies who work here!

<blank>

And by the way, how do you judge quality?"

You can tell by the taste. Good ones are almost tasteless and odorless, but bad ones taste bad, stinky and have a bad texture. Even the good ones make me sick if I drink too much of them.

<blank>

I see. Taste.

I sip my mug of sake. The alcohol in this world is tepid and low in alcohol content, but it has a slight sweetness to it that I like.

<blank>

"Oops, let's stop with that one drink today," he said. It would be a shame to forget all the things I taught you.

Huh?　Uh, sure, ......."

If you join the merchant guild, make sure you have enough money in your pocket. I'll pick you off without mercy.

<blank>

He said, "I'm going to pick it back up. You stop me when I say that?

I had to chuckle at that line of kindness max.

<blank>

<blank>

Leaving the Shun Lai Pavilion, I decided to go home.

However, I have no lodging, nor do I feel comfortable being in the care of a church for two days in a row. My home, that is, of course, storage space.

<blank>

I copied the blanket at the church, so I can at least sleep and get up inside the storage space now. Hmph.

<blank>

However, I wander off to an unpopular part of the alleyway because I don't want people to see me entering the storage space. Ah, it's just one drink, but it's a little boozy.

This body is so young and has a much lower tolerance for alcohol. ...... hiccup.

<blank>

<blank>

Hey, girl, this is a roadblock.

<blank>

Hmm?　Oh, you mean me, young lady?

I bow lightly and turn back to the man who approached me, saying, "Oops, I beg your pardon.

Then another man blocked my way.

<blank>

We have to pay a toll to get through.

"Onya?　Really? If ...... is just one road, then where am I supposed to go?"

"Well, I wonder where he is. Shall I let you go to heaven?"

Oh, up there. Oh, okay. I'm sorry to bother you.

<blank>

I flew up into the sky.

Oh, well, if it's in the sky, no one can see you!　Great discovery!

<blank>

At ......, they entered a storage space above the town of Solacidore and spent the night. Hiccup.
