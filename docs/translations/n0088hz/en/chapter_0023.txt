# PKK (Meaning "Let's Hunt the Hunters!")

<b>

I’m Karina-chan! I defeated evil and got my wallet!

You know, it’s common in games for enemies to drop money when defeated. It’s like that.

<b>

"Man, these guys are pathetic... They don’t have any money at all. Ah, so that’s why they’re doing this."

<b>

...Oops, that was a line where it’s hard to tell who the villain is!

Oh dear, oh dear. Karina-chan is a beautiful girl of justice.

Justice is great; as long as you have the name of justice, people can be as cruel as they want.

<b>

I put away Wallet B into my storage space and stagger off to another alley.

<b>

"Hey, sis— you’ve got money, right? Share a little with me."

"Or you won’t see the morning sun tomorrow?"

"Come on! Jump! Shake those breasts!"

<b>

Wallets C, D, and E have appeared! It seems this town's back alleys have their own territories. And it looks like the protection money goes into a safe?

<b>

So, after touring all the territories Wallets A and B mentioned, it’s off to the safe!

<b>

"…I-I don’t want to disappear, help—"

"Next, let’s go!"

<b>

I tidy up the wallets into my storage space and head to the next territory.

Still, you guys are really one-dimensional. I’m getting a bit bored.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, lumberjack girl. Hand over your wallet."

"I’ll teach you something good. Hand over half your earnings to me, and I’ll take care of you."

<b>

Oh? This is a punk adventurer! The flavor has changed a bit, and it feels nice. It’s like changing the taste of ramen.

Well, what I’m doing is the same, though.

Even if the flavor changes, ramen is still ramen. The way you eat it doesn’t change.

<b>

<b>

"You’ve parted ways with Blade, right? I’ll take care of you. How about it?"

"Come to our inn. I’ll make you feel better than that goody-two-shoes loser."

<b>

Huh? Don’t talk bad about Blade-senpai.

<b>

"Hey. I hate backbiting. If you’re going to say something, say it to their face! That drunkard is a pathetic guy who can’t handle money!"

"…Isn’t that what you’re doing, backbiting?"

"You’re not speaking the truth, punk adventurer! It’s only me who can nitpick here! Shut up, you loser! You’re the type who deserves to suffer with a knife stuck in your ass from a goblin!"

"Hey, this guy is really drunk."

"Yeah."

<b>

What? I’m sober, though? Oh dear, it seems I’ve picked up a bit of the punks' dirty language. Karina-chan will reflect on that!

I need to use a bit more human-like, clean words instead of monkey talk.

<b>

"By the way, what rank are you guys? Ah, I got it. G rank! Right, that’s it? You look weak after all!"

"We're D rank! You’re one hell of a cocky girl."

"Even though it’s fun to subdue people like you, there’s a limit… Should I choke you until you shut up?"

<b>

The punks are twitching with veins bulging at their temples. It’s working, it’s working.

…Wait, they were talking bad about Blade-senpai even though they can’t even become C rank. They seem to have some personality issues.

<b>

"Hey. Let’s teach these E rank losers to respect their seniors."

"Yeah, in terms of skill, we’re pretty much B rank!"

"Ha, what a lie! If you guys are B rank, then I’m S rank! You’re all weaklings!"

"“We’ll kill you!!!”"

<b>

Here it comes. They threw a punch, so I put them into storage the moment the fist hit—done!

It’s clearly a match pump abduction. I think this is the most legitimate self-defense.

<b>

<b>

"Is this the end of the line?"

<b>

I’ve finished touring the territories Wallet B told me about.

In the end, the contents of the wallets totaled about five silver coins, which is a very pathetic amount...

<b>

I could earn more just by lumberjacking; no wonder no one wants to get involved.

Just saying.

<b>

<b>

…But more than that, what should I do with the ones I put into storage?

It’s over fifteen now, so saying I stuffed them all into my backpack is a stretch...

<b>

If these punks were girls, my mood would lift a bit, but why are they all guys? Damn it, they won’t even become used sock manufacturing machines.

<b>

They’re just punks doing petty extortion in the alleys; they’re not even bounty targets. Even if I wanted to sell them, where would I go? They must have connections with slave traders, right?

But then again, saying "Should I just kill them?" feels off too.

<b>

I don’t know about others, but they haven’t really done anything to me.

It’s a hassle to hear each charge and decide on a fitting punishment. It’s not my job to shake them down for dirt...

<b>

<b>

<b>

Ah. I’ve thought of a good idea. I’ll throw them all into a holding cell.

Of course, it wouldn’t be fun just to throw them in.

I’ll give them a little scare first to make it easier for them to confess their wrongdoings.

<b>

"I’ll tell you, if you do bad things, God will come and make you suffer, so just confess quietly," I’ll threaten them, and then leave the rest to the locals.

<b>

<b>

The operation is called "NAMAHAGE"!

<b>

<b>

<b>

It saves me trouble, and there’s no need for unnecessary killing or being killed, and it’ll also be a credit to the justice system.

It’s a win-win situation!

<b>

"Then, the place to threaten them should be over there."

<b>

So, I use teleportation.

The destination is the place where the gods recently went on a rampage—the ruins of the Alchemy Kingdom.

<b>

If I go there, even if I go overboard, there won’t be any damage to the surroundings anymore.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

…By the way, it’s a secret that it took a long time to threaten everyone, and I ended up not being able to show my face at the safe that day.
