# PKK (Let's hunt people hunting!　(meaning "Let's hunt people!")

(What do you mean you're adapting fast?　(Hint: it's a tutorial)

<blank>

My name is Karina!　I defeated the evil and got the purse!

You know, like in video games, when you defeat an enemy and he loses money. It's like that.

<blank>

"Shhhh, these guys are so shikked. ...... They don't have any money at all. Oh, that's why they're doing this?"

<blank>

...... Oops, that was one of those lines where I no longer know which one is the villain!

No, no, no, no. Karina is a righteous and beautiful girl.

Justice is good. People can be as cruel as they want as long as it's in the name of justice.

<blank>

I put my wallet B away in the storage space and stagger back to another alleyway.

<blank>

"Wait, sis--you have money, don't you?　Give me some."

Otherwise you won't see the sunrise tomorrow, will you?"

Jump, jump, jump!　Try jumping, jump!　Shake your tits!"

<blank>

Wallets C, D, and E showed up!　Apparently, each back alley in this town has its own territory. And it looks like the miser's fee goes into the safe, right?

<blank>

So, after visiting all the territories that the wallet AB told me about, I go to the vault!

<blank>

"...... don't want to quit, don't want to quit, save me--"

Let's go next!

<blank>

We put our wallets away in the storage space and moved on to the next territory.

You guys are really one-track minded, though. I'm getting a little tired of it.

<blank>

<blank>

'Hey lumberjack sis. It's my wallet."

'I'll tell you what's good for you, senior. You give half of what you make to your seniors to take care of you, okay?"

<blank>

Whoa. This is a thuggish adventurer!　A nice little change of flavor. It's like changing the flavor of ramen.

Well, what we do here is the same.

Ramen is still ramen even if you change the flavor. It doesn't change the way you eat it.

<blank>

<blank>

"You left Blade and the others, didn't you?　I'll take care of you. Right?"

Come to our inn. We'll make you feel better than that good-natured bum."

<blank>

Oh?　Don't talk bad about Blade Paisen.

<blank>

Hey," he said, "I don't like backbiting. I don't like backbiting. If you're going to say something, say it in person!　He's a drunk, money-grubbing, pathetic guy!"

...... isn't that backbiting from you?"

Don't you dare talk right to me, you punk-ass adventurer!　I'm the only one who's allowed to fry you here and now!　Shut your mouth, you scum!　You're just a punk who deserves a knife in the ass from a goblin!

Hey, this guy's pretty drunk.

That's right."

<blank>

What? Barefaced?　Oh no, I think I've picked up a bit of the thugs' dirty tone. I'm sorry, Karina!

We need to use more human-like words, not monkey words.

<blank>

What rank are you guys, by the way?　Oh, okay, G rank!　Hey, it's a hit, isn't it?　Because no matter how you look at it, you look weak!"

He's a D-rank!　Damn cocky bitch, this guy."

"Even though I can't wait to bring these things to their knees, there's a limit to how far I'll go. ...... If I strangle them, will they shut up?"

<blank>

The punks with blue streaks and twitching at their temples. It's working, it's working.

I wonder if ...... or if they were saying bad things about Braid senpai even though they can't make the C rank. These guys seem to have personality problems.

<blank>

Hey, let's teach the E-ranked zakos to respect their seniors."

"Hey, we're even a B in terms of ability!"

P-please don't lie to me!　If you guys were ranked B, I'd be ranked S!　Zako-zako-zako!"

I'll kill you!"

<blank>

I'm in the air! He hit me and the moment his fist hit me, I put him away in the storage space, done!

Clearly a match-pumping abduction and confinement. This is the most justifiable defense.

<blank>

<blank>

I guess that's the end of the story, huh?"

<blank>

I finished going around the territory that I had heard all the way from wallet B.

In the end, the wallets were very thin, with a total of only 5 silver coins in the wallet. ......

<blank>

I could make more money as a lumberjack than as a regular lumberjack, no wonder no one wants to touch it.

What the heck.

<blank>

<blank>

...... or, for that matter, what should I do with the ones I put in the storage space?

There are more than 15 of them, so it's impossible to say that they are all packed in a backpack. ......

<blank>

I would be a little more excited if the goons were girls or something, but why are they all guys? Damn it, they can't even be used sock makers.

<blank>

They're just back-alley muggers, not really bounty hunters, I guess. Even if they were to sell, where would they go?　Where would they go? They have connections with the slavers, don't they?

But I don't know if I would say, "Well, let's kill him.

<blank>

I don't know about the rest, but I ain't had that much done to me by these guys.

It's too much trouble to ask for every single crime and suitable punishment. It's not my job to beat the dust out of them. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ah. I've got an idea. Let's lock them all up.

Of course, it's boring to just dump it in.

Let's scare them a little first to make it easier for them to come clean about their misdeeds.

<blank>

If you do anything wrong, the gods will come and hurt you, so just turn yourself in and leave the rest to the locals.

<blank>

<blank>

The name of the operation is "NAMAHAGE"!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It would save me a lot of trouble, I wouldn't have to kill or be killed for nothing, and I could take credit for the judicial process.

It's a three-way street!

<blank>

Then that would be a good place to make the threat."

<blank>

That is why I use transition.

The destination is the place where God went on a rampage just recently - the former site of the Alchemy Kingdom.

<blank>

If you overdo it there, there's no more damage to the surrounding area.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It's a secret between us that it took me a long time to scare everyone off of ...... and I didn't end up getting to the vault that day before I showed up.
