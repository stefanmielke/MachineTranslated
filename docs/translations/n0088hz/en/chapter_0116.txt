# I am really looking forward to it...!

<b>

Revival! Karina-chan is back!

<b>

Wow, I never expected Aisia to be plotting something like that... Hehe, is Dia-kun going to decorate himself with ribbons and say, "I'm the present"? I'm looking forward to it... but I can't make a move!

<b>

In that case, I should consult the gods. Literally a "praying to the gods in times of trouble."

I offer a prayer at the inn's altar.

<b>

"So, that's the situation, God. What should I do...?"

'Karina-chan, the gods definitely want to see the naked ribbon Dia-kun, so please don't use the sneaky-kun at that time. Thank you!'

"God?"

'Well, why not just go for it? Is there a problem with that?'

"Uh, well, you see. I'm a guy on the inside? Once I cross that line, I feel like I won't be able to go back."

'What? So, what's the problem?'

<b>

Oh no, this god has already crossed not just one line, but ten or a hundred. I chose the wrong person to consult.

But when I think about it, my body is female. So, making a move on a boy could actually be considered the right way to be... There really isn't a problem, at least on the surface. Well, if I overlook the fact that he looks young, Dia-kun is also legal.

<b>

'It's fine, it's officially sanctioned by the gods! I am the rule. Is there a problem?'

"Wow, no, there isn't. Except for my feelings."

<b>

It's really troublesome that the god is the rule.

<b>

'Well, I guess there's no helping it. So, how about a gender transformation potion for elves... No, let's not. A boy who looks like a girl is fine as is. A boy who doesn't is just a beautiful girl.'

"Being just a beautiful girl is fine, though!?"

'From the god's perspective, I think it's a bit of a cheat for a boy who looks like a girl to actually be a beautiful girl. Also, in sibling romance stories, having them be step-siblings is a bit of a letdown. It's contradictory to say minorities should be accepted while real siblings are out.'

"Well, that's because, in the case of blood relations, there are real harms involved. It's because of genetics that children can suffer, right? It's like, if it doesn't just end with the two of them, it's out."

'Hmm. When you put it that way, it makes some sense.'

<b>

The god ponders, "Hmm, hmm."

<b>

'Oh dear, we've gone off track. Well, from the god's perspective, there's really no problem, so why not just cross that line? That's all I can say.'

"Well, um, yes. That's true..."

'The god is really looking forward to Karina-chan's fall into femininity...!'

<b>

And with that, the presence of the god faded away.

<b>

Damn it. I was recommended to fall into femininity.

...At this point, I have no choice but to thoroughly clear my mind to avoid making a move on Dia-kun. My collection is about to ignite...!

<b>

＊　＊　＊

<b>

Physically, I feel like I've already fallen, but for now, I feel a bit sluggish as I resume dungeon exploration.

<b>

Last time, I was interrupted by spatial motion sickness, but this time, I think I'll keep my eyes closed as a countermeasure. After all, with spatial magic, I can perfectly grasp the terrain.

Plus, I'll be in invincible mode, so even if enemies attack, I'll be completely safe.

<b>

I close my eyes to block my vision. Switching to sensing through spatial magic allows me to grasp the surroundings. It's like a colorless 3D radar display, right? This should help alleviate spatial magic motion sickness. Good, good.

<b>

Looking around, it's a forest. There are moving things here and there, but these are probably monsters. They look like insects based on their outlines. They haven't noticed me and seem to be focused elsewhere.

Oh, I see a fight. Is that an adventurer? The opponent is a human-sized mantis. A user of Mantis Fist.

<b>

...Oh no! The adventurer is being cornered. This is bad!

Hang in there, adventurer! Don't lose! ...Ah, ah. This might be it.

<b>

"Ugh, not here...!"

<b>

A voice rises from the adventurer. It's a cute girl's voice. Yeah, I should help her.

To avoid falling into femininity, I need to make a dashing move to save the girl!

<b>

"Hey, need help?"

"What!? Hey, run away!! Why are you coming over here!? It's a Black Mantis!"

<b>

Huh? What's that, a black mantis? Is it a different color from the red one I saw yesterday?

...Hmm, it's probably just a difference like between a Yellow Hornet and a Red Hornet?

<b>

As I called out, the mantis flew toward me. Oh, right, they have wings. They can fly.

The mantis swings its scythes in a cross pattern, attacking me. But I'm in invincible mode... Oh, but being seen by the adventurer isn't good. I should dodge.

<b>

As a user of spatial magic, I can easily see safe zones!

Wait, did I just get hit? Huh? I dodged, right? ...Ah! Is that a skill or something? Is the attack range expanded? I messed up!

<b>

"What!? The Black Mantis's scythe shattered!? What kind of hard head is that!?"

<b>

Crap. It seems like the mantis couldn't take it.

Well, it can't be helped. Let's wrap this up quickly.

<b>

"Air Cutter!"

"Chop――"

<b>

I sever the mantis's head. But I won't let my guard down yet. Insect types can still move after death... Oh no! A hairworm!! Grosssssss!!

<b>

"Air Cutter! Air Cutter!"

"W-whoa, that's amazing... The Mithril Devil is being minced!"

<b>

Wait, is this guy made of mithril!? ...Well, I guess I'll let it slide!

Though I feel like I've messed up a bit myself.
