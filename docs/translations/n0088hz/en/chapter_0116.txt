# I look forward to it with all my heart. ......

<blank>

Resurrection!　Kalina is back!

<blank>

I never thought that Isiah would have such a plan. ......, Dia decorated it with ribbons and said "I'm your present"?　I'm looking forward to it,......, but I can't let you get your hands on it!

<blank>

In such a case, let's consult God. It is literally "asking God for help in times of trouble.

Offer prayers at the inn's altar.

<blank>

I'm sorry, but God, I'm not sure how to do this. What should I do? ......"

I would love to see you in a naked ribbon, Carina, so please don't use Koshori at that time. Please don't use Cossori at that time.

God?"

'Yah, why don't you just put your hand out? What's the problem?'

I'm a man inside. I'm a man inside.　Once I cross the line, I don't think I can go back.

'?　So, what's the problem?"

<blank>

Oh my God, this is the one who originally jumped over not just one line, but ten or even a hundred lines. I'm talking to the wrong person.

No, but if you think about it, my body is a woman. It's not too much to say that it's rather the right way to be when you touch a boy,...... and there's certainly no problem, on the surface. The most important thing to remember is that you can't be too careful when it comes to your health and wellbeing.

<blank>

'Don't worry, it's God-approved!　I am the rule. What's the problem?'

'Wow, no. Except for my sentiments."

<blank>

It's a problem because God rules in the gutter.

<blank>

I'll just have to do it. Well, I'll just catalog sex change pills for elves ...... No, I'm not going to do that. It's okay to have a male daughter because she's attached to a man. A man-daughter without it is just a beautiful girl.

I hope she's just a beautiful girl!"

I think it's sweet that a guy's daughter is actually a beautiful girl. Also, I'm the type of person who would be disappointed if I found out that my brother and sister were actually brother and sister in law in a brother-sister romance story. I think it's a contradiction to say that minorities are a problem, but real siblings are not.

No - that's because, well, if it's a consanguineous relationship, there's real damage. Because the child will be harmed by heredity or something, right?　It's not completed by them alone, so it's out, sort of."

'Mmm. You have a point when you put it that way.

<blank>

Mmmm," ponders God.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I digressed. Well, from God's point of view, there is no problem at all, so why don't you at least cross the line?　That's all I can say.

Well, um, yes. Right. ......."

'God is really looking forward to Karina's fall into meth, ......!

<blank>

And the sign of God left.

<blank>

Damn. They recommended female depravity.

...... If this happens, I'll just have to clear it out thoroughly to keep my hands off you, Dear. My collection is on fire, ......!

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Physically, I don't feel like I've already fallen, but for now, I'm resuming my dungeon crawl while feeling somewhat lazy.

<blank>

Last time I was interrupted by space sickness, but this time I'm going to attack the game with my eyes closed as a countermeasure. I have spatial magic, so my grasp of the terrain is perfect.

Plus, it keeps them invincible, so they are absolutely safe even if an enemy attacks them.

<blank>

Close your eyes to block out vision. Switching to spatial magic sensing allows you to grasp your surroundings. The image is like a three-dimensional radar display without color.　This would alleviate spatial magic sickness. Okay, okay.

<blank>

Looking around, you see that you are in a forest. There are moving things here and there, but they are probably monsters. It looks like an insect. It doesn't seem to notice us, and its attention seems to be focused on something else.

Oh, I found them fighting. Adventurers, perhaps?　The other guy is a mantis the size of a human being. It's a mantis.

<blank>

...... Oops!　The adventurers are on the ropes. Pinch!

Hang in there, adventurers, don't lose! ......Ah, ah. I think I'm going to lose this one.

<blank>

Damn, here's ......!"

<blank>

And then a voice rises from the adventurers. It's the voice of a pretty girl. Yes, let's help her.

He does a handsome move to dutifully help the girl to avoid a meth fall!

<blank>

Hey, you need help?"

What?　Hey, run away!　What are you doing over here?　It's Black Mantis!

<blank>

Hmm?　What is that, a black praying mantis?　Is it a different color from the red one we saw yesterday?

...... hmmm, about the difference between a Yellow Hornet and a Red Hornet?

<blank>

The praying mantis flew toward me as I called out to it. I see, they have wings. They can fly.

A praying mantis attacks me, waving both scythes in a crisscross pattern. But I am invincible. ...... Oh, but it's not good to be seen by adventurers. I'll avoid them.

<blank>

As a master of spatial magic, I can easily see through the safe zone!

I think I just got hit with something, didn't I?　Hmm?　I dodged that one, didn't I? ...... Ah!　Is it a skill or something!　It's expanding the attack detection!　I made a mistake!

<blank>

What?　Black Mantis's scythe shattered!　What kind of stone head is that!"

<blank>

Oh, shit. It looks like that one couldn't take it.

Hmmm, well, what can I do? Let's just get it over with.

<blank>

Air Cutter!"

"Gich--"

<blank>

The mantis' head is dropped. But don't let your guard down yet. The insect system still moves after death. ...... Oh, wow!　A harlequin bug!　That's disgusting!

<blank>

Air cutter!　Air cutter!"

Nah, wow. ...... mithril-devil-shredded."

<blank>

Oh, what's this guy's mithril! ...... I can't help it, I'll forgive him then!

No, well, I feel like I've done something wrong myself.

<blank>
