# The circumstantial evidence is all there!!

<b>

I’m Karina! Right now, I’m searching for the culprit who tried to blow up the dungeon core!

The most suspicious person is―― surprisingly, me! But looking at it objectively, I can’t deny it!!

<b>

- I can sneak into the depths of the dungeon. There’s a new route, and I could ignore the door guard.

- The barrier in front of the core is no problem at all. There’s also the possibility of it being a self-made act.

- By the way, I seem to know a lot about magical tools. I can easily produce communication magical tools.

- I’m trying to hide my appearance and deceive others.

- I have a past of large-scale logging of treant materials.

<b>

The circumstantial evidence is all there!! It’s too much!!

It’s not me, I swear!!

<b>

“W-wait, Karina! Was it your self-made act!?”

“...I am not the culprit! Also, I am not Karina, I am a healer.”

“It doesn’t matter! I believe in you, okay! You’re not the culprit, right!?”

“Wait, Shirogane. I believe that the healer is not the culprit. They are a suspect, though.”

<b>

Oh, is that so?

<b>

“Don’t scare me... By the way, why is that? Now that you mention it, I do seem to look the most suspicious to myself.”

“If you’re this suspicious, then it’s actually suspicious in a different way. You’re cooperative, and based on your actions, I’ve decided to trust you. It seems Mashiro trusts you too.”

<b>

Is that really okay? I thought, but if I probe any further, it might lead to trouble, so I’ll refrain.

<b>

<b>

“And if it’s not the healer, the next most suspicious person is Shirogane, who can solo the dungeon boss—”

“Huh!? It’s not me! I can’t do something so troublesome!”

“—Indeed. I trust you as well, so I think it’s someone else.”

<b>

Mashiro hurriedly defends herself. Yeah, that’s a reasonable explanation.

<b>

“Well, that’s fine. So who is the culprit?”

“I don’t know, but... if the culprit knows the bomb has been disarmed, they might come back to set another one. So, I’d like to ask the two of you to secretly guard the core.”

<b>

Hmm. Is that really okay? They’re the first and second suspects. If they collude, the dungeon core will collapse.

<b>

“Of course, there will be a reward from the guild.”

“Do we not need to monitor ourselves?”

“Oh, that’s a possibility... Hmm, but well, it’s probably unnecessary. We can’t spare extra manpower. At least, the two of you reported the bomb. There’s no way both of you are the culprits, right?”

“...Well, if they were the culprit, they would have kept quiet about the bomb.”

“Exactly. That’s how it is. Yes.”

<b>

Garoon nodded as if that’s what he wanted to say from the start.

I wonder if this guild master is really okay...

<b>

“Understood. So, we just need to keep an eye out for anyone coming to the core, right?”

“Yeah. When you start watching, I’ll announce that there was a bomb. There should be some movement.”

“...Hmm, by the way, what if the culprit escapes in that case?”

“It doesn’t matter, right? If the person who set the bomb disappears, that’s that.”

“If it’s the Empire, they’ll probably target it again anyway. We just need to enhance the core’s defenses. Your job is essentially to guard the core during that time.”

<b>

They said they would manage it by the new moon.

I wonder if that’s true.

<b>

“Well, for now, it’s a request. Let’s accept it, Karina, or rather, healer.”

“Yeah, that’s right.”

“Alright, then let’s issue a request. Produce the guild certificate.”

<b>

Ah. Speaking of which, what should I do about the card? I only have Karina’s cute E-rank adventurer card! I can’t borrow Dia-kun’s...

<b>

“...Please register me as an adventurer.”

“Don’t you have an adventurer card? ...How did you get into the dungeon?”

“Yesterday, I used my friend Karina’s appearance, name, and identification... Garoon. Here’s the identification.”

“...Ah, with this, it should be fine. Alright, let’s issue it.”

<b>

Thus, I successfully obtained the adventurer guild certificate for the new adventurer healer with the universal identification.

Karina’s junior, an F-rank adventurer.

<b>

<b>

“Hey, Karina. That identification card feels a bit strange.”

“...Please don’t look at it like that, Mashiro. I don’t want to reveal my true identity too much.”

<b>

If you look too much, your head might go blank.
