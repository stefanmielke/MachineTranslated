# We have all the circumstantial evidence!

<blank>

I'm Karina, and I'm looking for the person who tried to blow up the core of the dungeon!　I'm looking for the person who tried to blow up the dungeon core!

The most suspicious person was - how dare I!　But looking at it objectively, all I can do is agree!

<blank>

I can sneak deep into the dungeon. There was a new route and the door guard could be ignored.

The warding in front of the core is no problem. Possibly a self-made.

He also seems to know a lot about magical tools. He usually produces magic tools for liaison.

He is trying to deceive by hiding his appearance.

He also has a record of large logging of torrent timber.

<blank>

The circumstantial evidence is all here!　It's all here!

No, it's not me!

<blank>

Oh, hey Karina!　Did you just make that up?

I'm not the killer!　And I'm not Karina, I'm a healer."

I don't care!　I believe in you, you know!　You don't, do you?

Wait a minute, Silver. We do not think that Mr. Healer is the culprit. He is a suspect.

<blank>

Oh, really?

<blank>

Don't scare me. ...... By the way, why?　I'm sure I looked most suspicious myself when I thought about it."

'If he's this suspicious, it wouldn't be the other way around. He's cooperating, and I've decided to believe him based on what I've seen him say and do. Masiello seems to believe it, too.

<blank>

Oh, is that right?　I thought so, but I don't want to go into it in any more detail, because it would be a bush snake.

<blank>

<blank>

And if it's not Mr. Healer, then the next most suspicious person is Silver, who can take down dungeon bosses solo--"

What?　It's not me, I can't do such a troublesome thing!

"Mm-hmm. Right. And since I believe in you as well, I'm assuming it's the other."

<blank>

Mr. Mashiro rushes to explain himself. Yes, it is a convincing reason.

<blank>

I hope so. Then who did it?"

"I don't know, but ...... if the culprits know the bomb has been disarmed, they may come back to set it off again. So, I need you two to escort the core in secret."

<blank>

Hmm. It's okay. They're the prime and secondary suspects. If they collude, the dungeon core will collapse.

<blank>

Of course, the guild will pay you.

Shouldn't our surveillance be put out?"

Oh, that's one way to do it, too. ...... We can't afford the extra manpower. At least two people reported the bomb. They can't both be the culprits, can they?"

...... Well, if it was him, he wouldn't have told us about the bomb."

That's what I'm saying. That's what I mean. Mm."

<blank>

Garoon nodded as if to say, "That's what I wanted to say from the beginning.

I wonder if this guildmaster is ok ......

<blank>

I understand. So we'll just stay at the core and keep an eye out to see if anyone comes in?

I'll tell you about the big bombing around the time you were on watch. I'll tell you about the big bombing around the time you guys were on watch. There has to be some movement."

...... Hm, by the way, what if that's why the perp got away?"

"I don't care. If it gets rid of the guy who put the bomb on me, so be it.

"If we're dealing with the Empire, they're going to come after us again anyway. We just need to reinforce the core's defenses separately. It is no exaggeration to say that our job is to protect the core in the meantime.

<blank>

He said that he will do something about it around the new moon.

I wonder if it is true.

<blank>

Well, it's a request anyway. Let's take it, Karina, I mean healer.

Mm-hmm.

Okay, then produce your guild identification card. I will issue a nomination request."

<blank>

Oh. Oh, well, what should I do with the card? All I have is Karina's adorable E-rank adventurer's card.　I can't borrow Dia's. ......

<blank>

...... Adventurer Registration, please."

'You don't have an adventurer's card? ...... how did you get into the dungeon?"

'Yesterday I used the figure, name and identity of my friend Kalina, ...... Mister Garoon. Here is your identity card."

I said, "...... Yeah, this is, well, okay. Okay, let's publish."

<blank>

Thus, he succeeded in obtaining an adventurer's guild certificate for a new adventurer healer with his universal ID.

I'm Karina-chan's junior, an F-rank adventurer.

<blank>

<blank>

Hey, Karina. Your ID looks a little strange to me."

......Don't look so hard, Mashiro-sama. I don't like to show you my true identity."

<blank>

If you look at it too much, it might make your head go poof.
