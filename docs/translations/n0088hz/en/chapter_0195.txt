The one who won that match was the bear-eared beastman.

But both of them looked battered and in pain. They were really going at it, and their faces were merciless.

<b>

"Isn't this a tournament? Will they heal in time for the next match? What do you think, Aisia?"

"We have potions, so I think they'll be fine."

<b>

Potions! I see, so that's what they have.

Looking on, the two players were receiving potions from the staff and drinking them. Some even applied them directly to their bruises. Wow, it seems like bruises heal quickly, that's amazing.

<b>

"Ruu-chan is good at making potions, right? Maybe we could have her make some to sell."

"…If it's potions from the grandmothers, they would definitely sell. Should we put the Five Elders' seal on them when we sell?"

<b>

Ruu-chan, known as the Five Elders' Barlzebul, seems to be a serious practitioner who trained in the Alchemy Kingdom.

(I felt a bit awkward listening to stories about the café of memories.)

<b>

"I think that's a good idea too. Since the healer is Mi-san's son, it would make sense to say we got them through that connection. Should we have her make some as rent?"

"Rent, huh. Now that you mention it, I hadn't really thought about it."

<b>

After all, it's not like I would ask my wife for rent, right? Rather, it feels like I'm using the workshop as bait to have her live with me.

<b>

"I heard Mashiro-san pays rent. Isn't that fine?"

"Ugh!? D-Dia-kun. Well, um..."

<b>

Mashiro-san pays her rent with her body, so, well, yeah.

If you think about it, all the Five Elders are also paying rent!

<b>

"Oh. …Setting aside the slave Aisia, I should probably pay rent too, right?"

"Eh!? Ah, um, um, you really don't have to worry about it!?"

"No! We need to be proper about these things!"

<b>

N-no way. Asking Dia-kun to pay rent...!

Dia-kun is a beautiful girl meant for admiration, and rent? No way... but if Dia-kun insists... just a little... though Mashiro-san might punish me later, but still...

<b>

"By the way, how much is it per month? I only have the allowance I got from my sister, so I think it would be best to pay it all at once when I go to my country."

"Eh!? Ah, y-yeah! Money... it's about money, right, yeah."

<b>

Huh. I feel a bit relieved, but also disappointed in myself.

<b>

"Dia-sama. If you pay with money, the rent for a room of the master’s base class will be quite a sum, you know? Unlimited use of the bath, a workspace, completely safe private room, three meals a day. The land area is immeasurable, and pets are allowed."

"…That's true. There aren't many places where you can keep a dragon."

"Arthur is my pet! That doesn't count! It doesn't count!"

<b>

Even though it seems like Arthur is closer to Dia-kun than to me, he is still my pet!

<b>

However, when I think about it, while Aisia and Arthur are technically my possessions, Dia-kun feels completely like someone I'm supporting. She's cute, super smart, and a reliable companion.

<b>

"Perhaps it would be quicker for Dia-sama to pay with her body?"

"Eh?"

"That seems to be the case. I'm not opposed to it either."

<b>

Wait, no way, are we really saying Dia-kun should pay rent with her body!?

…If I woke up in the morning with Dia-kun in my arms, that would be super happy...

<b>

"That said, housework is Aisia-san's job, and recently, with the Five Elders' workshop in operation, I haven't had a chance to contribute. I've been learning various things along the way..."

"Dia-sama has the job of taking care of Arthur, doesn't she?"

"That's just playing around normally, though... Is that really how it works?"

<b>

Ah, yeah. Paying with her body means just doing her job normally.

I got a bit flustered. Just a little.

<b>

"…Then let's say Dia-kun pays rent by looking cute and taking care of Arthur. I don't want to collect now anyway. …Besides, we're friends, so don't worry about it. I always get help from you, Dia-kun."

"Muu, if you say so, Onee-san. …Ah, the next match is starting!"

<b>

Saying that, Dia-kun looked at the ring.

By the way, while I was lost in thought about Dia-kun's "rent," the match had ended before I knew it.
