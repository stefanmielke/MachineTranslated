# Would you like to have it made in lieu of rent?

It was the bear-eared beastman who won that match.

But both were covered in bruises and looked sore. They were hitting each other so hard, and their faces were so merciless.

<blank>

This is a tournament, right?　Is it going to heal before the next match? What do you think, Isiah?"

We have potions, and I think they will cure."

<blank>

Portion!　I see that's what you got.

As I watched, two of the players were getting potions from the management staff and drinking them. They even applied some of it directly to the bruises. Oh, if it's just a bruise, it heals quickly, wow.

<blank>

I know Lou is good at making potions. I wonder if it would be possible to have her make them and sell them.

"I'm sure you can sell the potions at ...... grandmothers. Would you sell them with the Five Elders seal?"

<blank>

Roo, the Five Elders' Barr Zebre, is a full-fledged master who seems to have been trained in the alchemy kingdom.

(It was a little awkward listening to him talk about the cafes of his memories.)

<blank>

I think it's a good idea, too. The healer is now Mr. Mee's son, and it would be natural to say that he got it through that message. Would you like to have it made in exchange for rent?"

I didn't really think about it. Well, I didn't really think about it."

<blank>

Because I don't get rent from my wife.　It's more like he's using the workshop as bait to get her to live there.

<blank>

I heard you pay rent, Mr. Masiello. Isn't that fine?"

"Nggggh!　Dey, Dear-kun. That, uh."

<blank>

Mr. Masiello's rent is paid by his body, and his body pays his rent, so, well, yes.

I mean, if you put it that way, all the Five Elders are getting their rent paid too!

<blank>

Ah. Aside from ...... slave Isiah, I should pay rent too, right?"

What?　Oh, um, um, ki, don't worry about it!"

'No. I'm not going to do it!　I have to keep these things tight!"

<blank>

Oh, no. I can't believe I'm getting rent money from you, Deere. ......

Dia is a beautiful girl for viewing, but she can't afford to pay rent. ......Uh, but if Dia insists, she'll probably get punished ...... a little bit.... ....and later Mr. Masilo will probably punish you for it, but that's another ......

<blank>

I only have an allowance that my sister gives me.　I only have an allowance that my sister gives me, so I think I'll have to pay it all when I get to my country.

What?　Oh, yeah, right!　Money... ...... money, yes."

<blank>

That. I'm a little relieved, but I'm also disappointed.

<blank>

Dear Dia-sama. If you pay in money, your base class room will cost you a considerable amount of money.　You can use the bath as much as you want, there is a workshop, a completely secure private room, and three meals are included. The square footage is unmeasurable, and pets are allowed."

"...... indeed. It's not every day you get to keep a dragon or something like that."

'Arthur is my pet!　No cans!　No can do!"

<blank>

I have a feeling that she misses Dear more than me, but she is my pet!

<blank>

However, if you ask me, aside from Aisia and Arthur, who are my possessions, Dia-kun felt like I was completely providing for him. He's cute, super smart, and a reliable companion.

<blank>

After all, wouldn't it be quicker here to have Master Dear pay with his body as well?"

Eh."

I'm not sure I'm willing to do that. I wouldn't be too far off."

<blank>

Oh, no, no, no, no, you're still going to pay rent with your body, aren't you?

......I would be super happy to wake up in the morning and have Dear in my arms or something. ......

<blank>

The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your home is to make sure that it's a good place to live. I'm learning a lot of things on the side. ......

You have the job of taking care of Arthur, don't you?"

"It's just another normal play, but will ...... that be the case?"

<blank>

Uh, yeah. You pay with your body, which means you're in charge of a regular job.

I was in a bit of a hurry. Just a little bit.

<blank>

...... Then I'll just assume that Dear's rent is being paid by dressing cute and taking care of Arthur. I don't even want to collect it now. I mean, I'm a ...... friend, so don't worry about it. I'm always there for you."

'Mmm, if your sister says so. ...... Oh, the next match is starting!"

<blank>

Deere looks at the ring when he says that.

Incidentally, while I was agonizing over the thought of Dear's 'rent', the match was over before I knew it.
