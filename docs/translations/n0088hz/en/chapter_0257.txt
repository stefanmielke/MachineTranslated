# In a certain Chamber of Commerce.

At a certain trading house in the Gidlaga Empire.

<blank>

A woman of the demon tribe, dressed in a maid's outfit, is serving tea to the human master merchant and his guest.

<blank>

I put the tea down with a clink as the fat men are having a business meeting.

A collar indicating slave status was worn around the neck of the demoness as a matter of course, and the horns on her forehead were short and flattened near the base.

<blank>

...... is it time to stock up on a new one?"

<blank>

The merchant mutters, looking at the flat horns of the demoness.

<blank>

<blank>

Demons. Although they are classified as human beings, they are very close to demons.

And its "horns" have various medicinal properties.

<blank>

It relieves fatigue, increases strength, improves appetite, and promotes blood circulation. ...... and especially the female horns of the demon tribe are believed to increase energy.

<blank>

-in other words, it is good for nourishment and sells for a high price as a quality aphrodisiac.

<blank>

Since only a small amount can be extracted from one person, the horn powder is so valuable that it can be exchanged for a platinum coin of the same weight.

Therefore, in the empire, women of the demon tribe who could take horns were a resource to be traded in secret.

<blank>

Oh, and this guy is out of commission? So, this guy is out of commission?　He's still young. Are you going to sell him to a whorehouse?"

There are quite a few people who want to hold a demon modoki in their arms. Well, if you completely remove the horns, the appearance is not so different from that of humans. It's quite usable.

<blank>

The demoness frowned at the customer's question and the merchant's answer.

<blank>

Oh, what's that face? What is that look on your face? What's wrong with me, I saved you from being eaten by a dragon?　Come on, say thank you.

"...... yes, thank you master."

Hahaha!　That's all right. The demon modo is to flirt at best so as not to be defeated."

<blank>

A woman of the demon tribe bowing her head with a bow. Her heart is not in it at all.

<blank>

Indeed, at first I thought I had been saved from being sacrificed. I even thought it was a good thing that I, who was supposed to be sacrificed, was no longer there, and the village would be in trouble.

<blank>

However, he was tricked into signing a slave contract with this merchant as an employment contract, and soon after learned that he had been deceived.

The demon tribe was not required to sacrifice to the dragon. The merchants' madness. It was a scam to "procure" the women of the demon tribe.

<blank>

<blank>

...... This merchant spoke of it with great skill as he shaved the horns, the lifeblood of the demon tribe, with a gold file.

<blank>

'Killing and taking the horns is beneath you. If you use recovery magic in combination with it, you can harvest several times. So you had to keep them alive and enslave them. I like the fact that the product is profitable enough to pay the offerings to the ...... church. Boo-ha-ha!"

<blank>

However, there is a limit to recovery, and the horns of the demoness gradually became smaller and smaller. The result is the flat horns we see today.

<blank>

I wish I could be a part of it. I wish I could be a part of it.

Oh. Then, would you like to buy this one?　There's still a few horns left, and I'll give you ...... about this much."

<blank>

and scribble down the woman's price. It was a last-minute price tag that took into account the amount of horns left over and the sale to the whorehouse. Conscience price, a bit of a tough line to walk.

But the guest merchant saw this and smiled and nodded.

<blank>

Yes, I'll buy it at that price."

Are you sure?　We do not accept returns.

Yes, that's fine. I'd rather you didn't quit after all.

Then let's settle it right here and now."

<blank>

and then they knick their guild cards to each other and easily end up buying and selling each other.

...... slave contracts, but in the empire, the demon tribe is not a person. They were raw materials for medicine, a commodity that could be traded with a medicine license even if they were not slavers.

<blank>

'And even then, it wouldn't be profitable to sell all the remaining horns, would it?

If you dig, you can still get more. You'll get enough profit.

Oh!　I had a blind spot about dusting. I shall do the same next time."

"I must be careful not to inadvertently remove the contents of my head as well, ha ha ha!"

<blank>

The words, which do not consider the demon tribe to be fully human, make the demon tribe woman lose consciousness.

There is no longer anything but despair. Because of the slave contract, there is no escape.

<blank>

Then I'll go to the 'ranch' and get some new 'raw materials'.

Oh," he said. This will increase the distribution of drugs again. It's a good thing."

I'll go with you, if you want."　Would you like to come with me, if you don't mind?"

<blank>

The merchant invites his guests to join him.

<blank>

"Oh, may I?　Isn't this a secret 'ranch'?"

I thought it was time to collect it all. We need manpower. Lately, some people seem to have a strange hunch that it would be a good idea to bring in a 'sacrifice' from somewhere else.

I see. I see. If a "demon modoki" were to touch a human being, it would be justified to kill him or her. If I help you ......, of course you will receive a share of the profits, right?"

Yes, of course.

<blank>

With a grin, the merchants shake hands. A business deal has been concluded.
