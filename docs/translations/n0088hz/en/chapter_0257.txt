# At a Certain Trading Company.

At a certain trading company of the Gidlaraga Empire.

<b>

A woman from the demon tribe, dressed in a maid outfit, is serving tea to her human master, a merchant, and a guest.

<b>

She places the tea down with a clatter in front of the plump men who are discussing business.

The demon woman's neck is naturally adorned with a collar indicating her status as a slave, and her horns are short and flat, close to the base.

<b>

"…I suppose it's about time to procure a new one."

<b>

The merchant mutters as he looks at the demon woman's flat horns.

<b>

<b>

Demon tribe. While classified as part of humanity, they are a being very close to monsters.

And those 'horns' have various medicinal properties.

<b>

Fatigue recovery, stamina enhancement, appetite stimulation, blood circulation promotion. …And particularly, the horns of demon women are said to have effects that enhance vitality.

<b>

—In other words, they can be sold at a high price as a quality aphrodisiac that is good for nourishment and health.

<b>

Since only a small amount can be obtained from one, the powdered horns are a precious commodity that can be exchanged for the same weight in platinum coins.

Thus, demon women who can provide horns are also resources traded secretly within the empire.

<b>

"Oh? Then does that mean this one is no longer needed? She's still young, so will you sell her to a brothel or something?"

"Hahaha, there are quite a few who have a taste for wanting to embrace a monster-like creature. Well, if the horns are completely shaved off, she won't look much different from a human. She'll be quite usable."

<b>

The demon woman frowned at the guest's question and the merchant's response.

<b>

"Oh? What’s with that face? Do you have some dissatisfaction with me, who saved you from being eaten by a dragon? Come on, express your gratitude."

"…Yes, thank you very much, Master."

"Bwahahaha! That's more like it. The monster-like creatures should do their best to sell their charms so they won't be hunted."

<b>

The demon woman bowed her head slightly. There was no sincerity in her heart.

<b>

Indeed, at first, she thought she had been saved from becoming a sacrifice. She even thought it served the village right that the one who was supposed to be the sacrifice was gone.

<b>

However, she was deceived into signing a slave contract under the guise of an employment contract, and shortly after, she learned she had been tricked.

The demon tribe had not been required as sacrifices by the dragons. This was a farce by these merchants. It was a scam to "procure" demon women.

<b>

<b>

…While doing this, the merchant spoke proudly as he shaved off the horns, which could be said to be the life of the demon tribe.

<b>

"To kill and take the horns is the lowest of the low. By using recovery magic, you can harvest them multiple times. That's why it was necessary to keep her alive and make her a slave. …It's nice that even after paying the church's donations, this product still yields a good profit. Bwahahaha!"

<b>

However, there are limits to recovery, and the demon woman's horns gradually became smaller and could not fully recover. The result is the flat horns she has now.

<b>

"Well, well, what a good product. I wish to benefit from it as well."

"Oh? Then shall I buy this one? There are still a few horns left… how about this price?"

<b>

He scribbles down the price for the woman. It was a price set at the very edge, considering the remaining horn quantity and the potential sale to a brothel. A bit harsh to be called a fair price.

But the guest merchant looked at it and smiled, nodding.

<b>

"Yes, I'll buy it at that price."

"Is that so? No returns will be accepted."

"Yes, that's fine. Rather, you won't suddenly decide to back out, will you?"

"Then let's settle the payment right here."

<b>

With a clink, they tapped their guild cards together, and the transaction was completed easily.

…Though they have a slave contract, in the empire, demon tribes are not considered humans. As a raw material for medicine, they could be traded even without being a slave trader, as long as one had a medicine license.

<b>

"Still, selling all the remaining horns won't yield a profit."

"Not at all, if you dig a bit deeper, you can still get more. There's plenty of profit to be made."

"Ah! Digging was a blind spot. I'll do that next time as well."

"I must be careful not to accidentally shave off the contents of my head, hahaha!"

<b>

At those words, the demon woman felt her consciousness fading, realizing that they did not consider her a person at all.

There was nothing left but despair. Because of the slave contract, she couldn't escape.

<b>

"Then I shall go procure new 'raw materials' at the 'farm.'"

"Oh, this will increase the distribution of medicines again. That's a good thing."

"That's right! If you don't mind, shall we go together?"

<b>

The merchant invited the guest.

<b>

"Oh? Is that alright? Isn't it a secret 'farm'?"

"Not at all, I thought it would be better to collect everything soon. I need more hands. Recently, there are those who seem to be suspiciously saying things like 'we should abduct a sacrifice from somewhere.'"

"Oh, I see. If a mere monster-like creature were to lay hands on a human, extermination would be justified. …If I help, I suppose I would get my share, right?"

"Yes, of course."

<b>

With a grin, the merchants shook hands. The deal was struck.
