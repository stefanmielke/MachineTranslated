# Keep it on the shelf

......At any rate, thievery is not good."

<blank>

I said yes. I'll put it on the shelf that I was trying to steal too.

<blank>

"Yes, but there are unavoidable circumstances. But there are unavoidable circumstances."

Sir."

Hermes. Goway. Good. Step back."

<blank>

The big man escorting him quickly retreated when he said that. You are faithful to your orders, aren't you?

<blank>

The strangely dignified man, whom I called my husband, begins to speak to me.

<blank>

Do you know about the ...... alchemy kingdom?"

Mm?　Oh. I know you."

"It was destroyed. "He was destroyed...in the wrath of God."

<blank>

Oh, yeah. I know that too. I mean, I did it.

<blank>

And God sent His messenger to this world. It was Velarde who reported to me."

"......mu?"

"The former wife of the Lord, Lady Maria Belle, has been successfully contacted.

<blank>

Oh, yeah. I've heard of ...... somewhere...?

<blank>

'We're also checking the evidence. The pirate Gomez. The disappearance of the base and the sacred weapon "Poseidon". The site of the base was cut clean through to the basement. It was cut out so precisely that it could not have been done by human hands."

Oh, oh.

<blank>

Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure that's me.

<blank>

And the apostle said. "Then the apostle said, 'Offer the sacred object, or in ten years this world will be destroyed.

Wait a minute?"

<blank>

You've got a slightly different nuance!　I couldn't help but be a little honest!

<blank>

Oh, well, Grandma Maria, I thought you said you were going to report to the top. Oh, that.

Hmm?　So, could it be that this guy is a national bigwig ......?

<blank>

'Gehn! ...... Ah, who are you?　Are you not just a thief in the employ of a thief?"

I'd like to ask you the same thing. Is the escort who was standing out front alive?"

You're safe. I assure you, not a single injury, not a single life."

"Oh," he said, "that Konoe was subdued without a sound and unharmed. That Konoye was conquered without a sound, and that without a scratch. A formidable force to be reckoned with. ......

<blank>

I didn't beat you. I came into this room completely ignoring you.

It's more like, "I didn't even know you were there.

<blank>

Let me introduce myself. I am King Pavel Kant III. King of the Kingdom of Pavelkant.

<blank>

That's a king!　Wow, you're the king!　No wonder he is so majestic!

Oh, so you're saying that your escort is a Kingsguard?

Wow, you're a hard-core civil servant! You're a super elite!

<blank>

"...... that, there has been a slight misunderstanding."

Misunderstanding?

Uh, no, I'm talking about here.

<blank>

The king still opens his mouth to speak.

<blank>

Well, you won't believe me if I tell you this out of the blue, but ...... it's the truth."

I fully believe this story!　I fully believe this story. Then, good-bye."

Mm?　Oh, we're still talking--"

<blank>

I quickly left the place as if to escape.

No, he actually ran away.

<blank>

He ran back to his base.

<blank>

Then I went back to my room and dived onto my bed and slumped down and flapped my legs.

<blank>

<blank>

--The cause, it's me!

<blank>

I was the cause of the targeting of the sacred artifact, and I was the one who stopped it!

That's a match pump!　I'm a clown who was dancing around without realizing what was going on!

<blank>

How embarrassing!　I was too embarrassed to be there!

<blank>

<blank>

I mean, God, this is definitely the kind of thing that makes you laugh with your stomach in your chest!

I know, I know, damn it!

<blank>

<blank>

Gosh, I can't make a plea to Meechan. ......

I'll have to write a letter of complaint to Grandma Maria later at ....... Mooo!

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, shit. I forgot to collect the fake "Breaking Wall Hammer".

<blank>

......

......

I don't know ......!　I don't know any more!　I'm going to bed！！！！
