# Put on the Shelf

"…For now, stealing is not good."

<b>

I said that, putting aside the fact that I was also trying to steal.

<b>

"Indeed. However, there are unavoidable circumstances."

"Master."

"Hermes. Gowe. Good. Step back."

<b>

With that, the large bodyguard stepped back smoothly. He is quite obedient to orders.

<b>

The strangely dignified man, referred to as "Master," began to speak to me.

<b>

"…Do you know of the Alchemy Kingdom?"

"Huh? Ah, yes. I know of it."

"It has perished. It incurred the wrath of the gods."

<b>

Ah, yes. I know that too. In fact, I was the one who did it.

<b>

"And the gods sent the Apostle to this world. The report came from Verald."

"…Huh?"

"The former lord's wife, Lady Mariabelle, succeeded in making contact."

<b>

Ah, yes. …I feel like I've heard that somewhere before?

<b>

"I have confirmed the evidence. The pirate Gomez. The disappearance of his base and the divine artifact 'Poseidon.' The site of the base was meticulously cut out down to the underground. It was so precise that it could not have been done by human hands."

"O-oh."

<b>

Ah, yes. No doubt about it, this is about me.

<b>

"And the Apostle is said to have declared: 'Surrender the divine artifact, or else this world shall perish in ten years.'"

"Wait a minute?"

<b>

The nuance is slightly different!! I unintentionally let my true self slip out!

<b>

Ah, now that I think about it, Granny Maria did say she would report it upwards. So that’s it.

Huh? Then could it be that this person is a high-ranking official of the country…?

<b>

"Ahem! …Ah, who are you? You are not merely the employer of a thief, are you?"

"I would like to ask the same. Is the bodyguard who was outside still alive?"

"He is safe. He has no injuries, and I assure you his life."

"Really. That Konoé was subdued without a sound, and unscathed as well. A terrifyingly powerful individual…"

<b>

I didn't actually defeat him. I completely ignored him and entered this room.

In fact, I didn't even notice he was there.

<b>

"Then let me introduce myself. I am King Pavelkant III. The king of the Pavelkant Kingdom."

<b>

A king! Wow, a king!! No wonder he has such a dignified presence!

Wait, does that mean the bodyguard over there is a royal guard?

Wow, that's amazing, a serious public servant. An elite for sure!!

<b>

"…It seems there has been a slight misunderstanding."

"Misunderstanding?"

"Ah, no, it's about our side."

<b>

The king opened his mouth to continue speaking.

<b>

"Well, you may find it hard to believe being told such a thing suddenly, but… it is the truth."

"Y-yes! I will fully believe this story. Then farewell."

"Huh? Ah, the conversation is not over—"

<b>

I hurriedly left the scene as if I were escaping.

No, I actually did escape.

<b>

I fled back to my base.

<b>

And as soon as I returned to my room, I dove onto my bed and flailed my legs while lying face down.

<b>

<b>

—The cause is me!!

<b>

The reason the divine artifact was targeted is me, and I was the one who prevented it!

What a ridiculous self-fulfilling prophecy!! I was just a fool dancing without realizing it!?

<b>

So embarrassing! I was so embarrassed that I couldn't stay there!

<b>

<b>

By the way, the gods must be laughing their heads off at this, right!?

They know what's going on, damn it!!

<b>

<b>

Gah, I can't explain this to Mii-chan…!

…I have to write a complaint letter to Granny Maria later. Ugh!

<b>

<b>

Ah, crap. I forgot to retrieve the fake "Castle-breaking Hammer."

<b>

……

……

…I don't care! I don't care anymore!! I'm going to sleep!!!!
