# Is she the Dragon Priestess...?

<b>

<b>

"Win four times to become the champion, Arthur."

『Gyuwaon』

<b>

Communication with familiars. It's an indicator of a Tamer's skill, and this pair seemed perfect in every way.

<b>

The opposing competitors were somehow managing to line up their familiars, boars and snakes, but... they were trembling pitifully. This was the first match, set up as a preliminary with seemingly unpopular participants.

In other words, the opponent had enough skill to enter the Familiar Cup, but honestly, they were weak.

<b>

"…Arthur, give a little howl. Over there."

『Gyaa! Gyaooooooon!!!』

<b>

"Hiih!?"

"「「「「「「――ッ！！」」」」」」

<b>

The trembling Tamer and familiars.

<b>

"De, Dear player! Please don't intimidate the opponent before the match starts!"

"Then hurry up and start it. …Arthur, you can't eat them, okay?"

『Gii? Gyaoon?』

<b>

The Thunder Dragon tilted its head in confusion. Where had the perfect communication gone... No, this duo was doing it on purpose.

If they didn't want to be eaten, they were threatening despite being told not to.

<b>

However, the words themselves were an admonishment, so the host couldn't scold them.

<b>

"I forfeit...! I can't let my family become dragon food!"

"The winner, Dear player!!"

<b>

In the first match, Dear won without fighting.

<b>

<b>

"Wise decision. Now, let's return to the waiting room, Arthur."

『Gyuah!』

<b>

As Dear pointed the orb and pressed the switch, a red beam extended toward the Thunder Dragon, enveloping it. Just like that, the Thunder Dragon vanished as if being sucked into a small orb.

<b>

At this point, the host cautiously spoke to Dear.

<b>

"Um, Dear player. If it's not too much trouble, could you tell us about that orb?"

"Mm? Ah, yes. Since the time for the match has completely opened up, it would be boring for everyone. There are also logistical concerns. That much is fine."

<b>

Dear held the orb high for all to see.

<b>

"This is called a Monster Orb, a magical tool borrowed from a certain dwarf prince."

"A magical tool from the Dwarf royal family! I see, so that's how you're controlling the dragon!"

"Eh? No, this is just for storage."

<b>

Dear tilted her head in confusion, and the host's eyes widened.

<b>

"Eh? …So, it's not the power of the magical tool, but you're purely commanding the dragon?"

"Well, yes. That's how it is."

"By the way, what other monsters do you command, Dear player?"

"No, nothing. I've never commanded anything other than Arthur."

<b>

Upon hearing this, the host speculated that she must have built a bond with the dragon since childhood.

And then—he recalled a certain rumor.

<b>

"—Are you the Dragon Priestess...?"

<b>

The Dragon Priestess. This refers to the royal family of a fallen nation that lived alongside dragons, specifically a princess who can draw out the true power of dragons.

Even dragons, who could only earn respect through strength, were said to bow their heads unconditionally to the princess.

<b>

For Tamers, she was a legendary figure. The host couldn't help but ask if that was true, using honorifics.

<b>

"…I'll leave that to your imagination."

"—ッ！！"

<b>

And Dear smiled sweetly. A refined smile befitting someone of royal lineage.

The host was captivated and lost for words.

<b>

"Well then, I should return to the waiting room."

<b>

With that, Dear gracefully stepped down from the stage and headed toward the waiting room.

The dazed host finally regained his senses and raised his voice to cover up his astonishment.

<b>

"Th-this is an unexpected dark horse! An incredible presence has crashed into the 'Familiar Cup'!! Those holding Dear player's betting slips should hide them from others!"

<b>

Despite the first match being a forfeit victory, the tournament was already hinting at a great excitement.

<b>

<b>

By the way, it’s just between us that the next tournaments will require the entry sheets to include the species of familiars, thanks to Dear and Arthur.
