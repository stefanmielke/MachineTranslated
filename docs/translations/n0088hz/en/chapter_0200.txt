# Is it a dragon priestess ......?

"If you win four times, you win, Arthur."

"Gyuahn."

<blank>

Communicating with a follower. The interaction is an indicator of a tamer's skill, and these two were perfect by all accounts.

<blank>

The opponents managed to line up their followers, boars and snakes, but ...... they are shivering pitifully. This is the first match that was set up as a prelude to the first match between those who are not likely to be popular in terms of dividends.

In other words, the opponent - although he was competent enough to try to compete in the Followers' Cup - was honestly weak.

<blank>

"...... Arthur, give me a little bark. Over there."

'Gyuah!　Gyah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!"

<blank>

Hi!

「「「「「「--! 」」」」」」

<blank>

Scared tamers and followers.

<blank>

Dey, Dey player!　Don't scare your opponent before the match starts!"

If so, get started. ...... Arthur, don't eat it, okay?"

Gee?　Gee?"

<blank>

The Thunder Dragon shows its head. Where is the perfect communication that just went ...... no. They know what they're doing, this duo.

If you don't want to get eaten alive by the madness at hand - and I'm threatening you, even though you told me not to threaten you.

<blank>

However, the moderator cannot note this because the words themselves are statements that condemn it.

<blank>

"I abstain from ......!　Oh, I can't feed my family to the dragons!"

"Here's the winner, Deere!"

<blank>

First match. Deere won without a fight.

<blank>

<blank>

It's a wise decision. Now, let's go back to the waiting room. Arthur.

Gyuah!"

<blank>

And when Dia pointed the ball and clicked the switch, a red ray of light extended toward the Thunder Dragon and enveloped it. As it was, the Thunder Dragon disappeared, as if sucked into the small ball.

<blank>

And here the moderator calls out to Dia fearfully.

<blank>

"Hey, Deere, if you don't mind. If you don't mind my asking, can you tell me about those balls?"

Hmm?"　Oh, that's right. It would be boring for everyone if we had a whole free period when we were supposed to play. It would be boring for everyone if we had to leave the entire game time open, and we would also have to make sure the game progressed smoothly. That's fine.

<blank>

And Deere shows it by holding the ball high in the air.

<blank>

It's called a demon ball, a magical tool borrowed from a certain Dwarf prince.

'The magical tools of the Dwarven royal family!　I see... This is how they control their dragons!"

Huh?"　No, this is just for storage. This is just for storage."

<blank>

The host's eyes widened as Dia tilted her head.

<blank>

What?" You mean to tell me that at ...... you're not using the power of magical tools, but purely following the dragon?"

'Well, yes. That's how it works."

By the way, what other demons do you cast?

'No, nothing. I've never used anyone other than Arthur."

<blank>

Hearing this, the MC surmised that he must have bonded with the dragon from an early age.

And then - I remember a rumor.

<blank>

"--is it the Dragon Priestess ......?"

<blank>

Dragon Priestess. It refers to the exiled royalty who lived with dragons, and among them, the princesses who can draw out the true power of dragons.

Even the dragons, who were supposed to gain respect only by force, hung their heads unconditionally to the princess.

<blank>

For tamers, he is a legend. The moderator unintentionally asked him respectfully if that was so.

<blank>

...... as you might imagine."

!

<blank>

And Dia smiled smugly. An elegant smile that was appropriate to be judged as royalty.

The moderator was stunned and speechless.

<blank>

Well, I'd better get back to the waiting room."

<blank>

With that, Dia shuffled off the stage and headed for the waiting room.

The stunned host finally regains consciousness and raises his voice to mend.

<blank>

This is a dark horse!　This is a dark horse!　I recommend anyone who has a betting ticket for Dia to hide it so the others don't find it!

<blank>

Despite the fact that the first game was a no-show - due to abandonment - the tournament foreshadowed a great deal of excitement.

<blank>

<blank>

Between you and me, it is a secret that Dia and Arthur have inspired me to ask the participants to fill in the entry sheet for the next and subsequent competitions, including the race of their followers.
