# Tsk, you sturdy bastard.

No, I'm not dead, okay?　Just full of holes.

And since he still didn't go down, I forced him down with spatial magic. And he was already on the verge of healing. The resilience is amazing. Is it because he is a beast or is it General Garou's skill? ......

If I had fought with just a gun with no magic, I might not have won.

'...... Ugghhhhhh ...... I thought I was going to die!'

"You shot me in the balls with a bullet and you're safe. ...... Damn, you tough son of a bitch."

"That's where I was guarding the most in a way,...... but to pull my guard a little,...... I really thought I was going to get crushed,...... you know, that was a foul. You know,......?"

<blank>

It's a crotch shot that goes up vertically from the groin with a ricochet (spatial magic). Special effect for men.

Well, whether it was a woman or not, she would normally die if shot through the groin toward the head, so I was planning to use spatial magic to stop her when she was moderately stabbed.

<blank>

He was still trying to fight with the pain in his groin, and this general is a gun-toting fighting maniac who seems to transcend his instincts while fighting by instinct.

<blank>

...... or do I smell that bad?"

I'm just saying, "Oh, my God. How thickly marked is that?　They are completely mixed and merged into one. I thought you were a half-animal disguised as a human.

<blank>

In terms of the degree of beastliness, it seems that they are almost human, and only their body odor is beastly (and it is not noticeable unless you have a good nose, like a wolf-like beastly person).

If there are people who are all fluffy, then there are also people who are almost all human.

He said, "Well, if you've come this far, you've definitely got to win. You beat King Barbaros and me, it should be a piece of cake."

I can't lose because there are 820 gold coins at stake. ......?　So if they pile up 1,000 gold coins or something, can I admit defeat ......?"

If anyone offers you such a story, you tell me, and I'll have him arrested and paid regardless of whether he wins or loses. If he has defiled the sanctity of the tournament, he deserves what he gets.

<blank>

State power to ......!　Nice work, General Garou. That's a safe bet for the championship.

<blank>

"Well, there are only two left, right?　Rest assured, the ones who are left are not the ones who would make such a proposal."

I see. A bit of a shame. ......"

By the way, the final will probably be Prince Ur, the son of King Barbaros. ...... You'll easily beat King Barbaros in a heartbeat."

<blank>

That may be true. I'm sure ...... won't kill you in a blink of an eye in the finals, right?　Really really really.

He returned to the waiting room.

<blank>

"Phew, only two rounds left, the semifinals and the finals."

<blank>

I stored it away without using it, getting a recovery potion given to me by the staff, but not actually fatigued by anything.

<blank>

"Thank you for your service, Mister."

'Hmm, thanks Isiah. ...... So, what's next for you?"

As we have just decided, this is probably the most formidable opponent for Aruji-sama in this tournament.

<blank>

The most formidable foe in this tournament. King Barbaros and General Garou, who were the favorites to win the championship, had an easy time, but the most powerful opponent ...... over those two?

<blank>

"You mean someone I might have a hard time dealing with?　What the hell is he like?"

I'm Misha, the Cat-Beastmaster. I'm ......, well, I'm a woman."

<blank>

...... I see!　That's a strong opponent ......

<blank>

In addition, socks ...... and awesomely ......!
