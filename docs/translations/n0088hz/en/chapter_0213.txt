# Tch, what a tough guy

<b>

<b>

No, I'm not dead, okay? Just full of holes.

And since he didn't fall even after that, I had to force him down with spatial magic. Plus, he was already starting to heal. His recovery ability is insane. Is it because he's a beastman, or is it General Garou's skill...?

I might not have won if I had only fought with guns and no magic.

<b>

“...Ugh, I thought I was going to die.”

“I shot through the bullets, and yet he’s fine... Tch, what a tough guy.”

“That’s because I was guarding that area the most... But to slip through my guard a little... I really thought I was going to be crushed... That’s unfair, you know...”

<b>

It’s a ricochet (spatial magic) shot that goes vertically up from between the legs. Male-targeted.

Well, even if it’s a woman, if shot from the groin to the head, they would normally die, so I planned to stop it with spatial magic once it pierced in moderation.

<b>

Even so, the fact that he was still trying to fight through the pain in his groin shows that this general is a battle maniac who seems to transcend instinct while fighting.

<b>

“...By the way, do I smell that bad?”

“Of course. How much intense marking did you have? You’re completely mixed and one with it. I thought you were a half-beastman disguised as a human.”

<b>

In terms of beastman degree, he’s almost human with only a beastman body odor (and it’s at a level that only those with a good nose like wolf-type beastmen can detect), it seems.

If there are fully fluffy ones, then it’s also true that there are those who are almost completely human.

<b>

“Well, now that we’ve come this far, you better win for sure. You beat King Barbaros and me, so it should be a piece of cake.”

“Yeah, with 820 gold coins on the line, I can’t afford to lose... Huh? Does that mean if someone offers 1000 gold coins, I can accept defeat...?”

“If someone brings that up, tell me, and I’ll capture them and make them pay regardless of the outcome. It’s only natural to deal with someone who sullied the sacred tournament.”

<b>

National power...!! You go, General Garou. If that’s the case, I can relax and aim for victory.

<b>

“Well, there are only two matches left, right? The ones left aren’t the type to make such proposals, so don’t worry.”

“Is that so? That’s a bit disappointing...”

“By the way, the final will probably be against Prince Ul, the son of King Barbaros... If you can take down King Barbaros in an instant, you should have no problem.”

<b>

That might be true. ...B-but you won’t instantly kill him in the finals, right? Really, really.

I returned to the waiting room.

<b>

“Phew, just two matches left: the semifinals and the finals.”

<b>

While receiving the recovery potion from the staff, I actually wasn’t tired at all, so I stored it without using it.

<b>

“Thank you for your hard work, my lord.”

“Yeah, thanks, Aisia. ...So, what’s the next opponent like?”

“It was just decided, and it’s likely the strongest opponent for you in this tournament.”

<b>

The strongest opponent in this tournament. King Barbaros and General Garou were easy wins, but to have someone stronger than those two...?

<b>

“Are you saying I might struggle against this opponent? What kind of person are they?”

“It’s the cat beastman, Misha. ...And, she’s a woman.”

<b>

...I see! That’s definitely a strong opponent...

<b>

And while we’re at it, socks... if I’m lucky...!
