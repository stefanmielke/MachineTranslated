I'm Karina, and I'm a little girl. The sun is yellow. ......

<blank>

So I retreated to the storage space and even spent some time deploying Mr. Cossori to investigate my own body.

Since he was making various small items, it is likely that his woodworking skills have improved.

<blank>

...... No. Chairs or tables?　Yeah. And a cup?

I tried to make a toothbrush out of wood fiber, but it was too hard and a bit painful. The fur bristles, on the other hand, were too soft, but both were quite useful in other ways - but that's beside the point. Well, what the heck. I'll do better next time.

<blank>

Well, I worked up a good sweat!

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, for the second time in a few days, we were in the port town of Velarde.

The dog-eared soldier is checking my guild card.

<blank>

'Departure is solasidore, 8 days ago. Your luggage looks fine, good to go through. Welcome to Velarde."

<blank>

Yeah, it was supposed to be 5 days, but 3 days have been added?

I was a little bit preoccupied with considerations and experiments and stuff, you guessed it.

No, no, no, don't notice. Even if you notice, pretend you don't.

<blank>

...... Well, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but I think you should apply the cleaning magic a little more forcefully, don't you?　It's not going to cause any unnecessary trouble, is it?　And the bath house is in the middle of town, okay?"

"...... hi, arigatoo gozaimasu."

<blank>

Do you smell that bad?　Does it smell that bad?　Enough to recommend a bath house!

Damn, I'm going to make a bath for myself in the storage space on my way back to Solacidore!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

With these thoughts in mind, I was finally able to pull my cart and enter the Velarde.

The streetscape is not much different, but I think there are more stone buildings than in Solacidore. Is it because of its resistance to the sea breeze?

<blank>

Let's get the delivery requests out of the way first.

While casting a cleaning spell on yourself, look for the Adventurer's Guild.

<blank>

There was a building that looked similar to the Adventurer's Guild in Solacidore. ...... is a quirky building, but I can't bring my cart with me inside. I guess there is no free parking there, so I'll just put it away in the storage space.

<blank>

Nominally, I guess you could say I left it at the inn. In fact, the storage space is where I sleep.

<blank>

<blank>

And here I will show you my new technique.

<blank>

First, there is a nondescript town corner. The space is developed there!

Turn toward that space.

<blank>

Then, lo and behold. I can't see me!

<blank>

<blank>

This is a new technique, optical camouflage!

<blank>

<blank>

At the end of the turn, from the side, they didn't see me from the beginning, so they didn't make a fuss,

The person behind me is a disappearing act that I can determine I lost him when I turned the corner.

This allows them to disappear spontaneously in the city and sow the seeds of pursuit!

<blank>

Well, it's not like I'm being chased by anything at the moment.

<blank>

It's just a little application of spatial magic.

Date didn't stay cooped up for eight days.

...... Actually, I don't really understand it either, but it's a secret between us that I was able to do something.

<blank>

<blank>

So I left the cart in the storage space and went to the Adventurers' Guild again with the box of delivery requests.

<blank>

Hello. Where should I put my delivery request?"

"Oh, that box is from Solacidore's, isn't it?　Bring it over here."

<blank>

The lady at the reception desk calls me to put my luggage on the counter.

<blank>

No sign of having been opened. ...... Yes, I received it. You got what you asked for. Here's your reward.

I'm sorry, I'm not sure. Also, where is the merchant guild?"

It's just a little ways to the right as you exit the guild."

Aaaaah!"

<blank>

Yeah, yeah, it's an ass-kicking.

The conversation flows along and is not particularly involved. This is normal.

So there was nothing special about Solacidore, except that when I first registered, I got tangled up with Braid senior.

<blank>

<blank>

I suddenly remembered that the gatekeeper had recommended a bathhouse.

...... You don't think I'm too smelly or you wouldn't want me around, do you?

<blank>

......

I think I'll go to the bathhouse before going to the merchant guild. I'll go to the bathhouse before I go to the merchant guild.
