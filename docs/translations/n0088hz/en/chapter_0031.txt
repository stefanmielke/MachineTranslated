# Use your imagination.

<b>

I’m Karina-chan. The sun sure is yellow today...

<b>

So, I holed up in my storage space, bringing out Mr. Stealth to pass the time by investigating my own body.

I’ve made all kinds of trinkets, so my woodworking skills must’ve improved.

<b>

…Chairs, tables? Yep. Cups, too?

I even tried making a toothbrush with wood fibers, but it was too stiff and a bit painful. The fur bristles were too soft, though they could be useful in other ways—but that’s for later. Anyway, I’ll do a better job next time.

<b>

Phew, worked up a good sweat.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, this is my second time in the port town of Vearald in a few days.

A dog-eared soldier is checking my guild card.

<b>

"Departure was from Sorashidore, eight days ago. No issues with your luggage; you’re clear. Welcome to Vearald."

<b>

Hmm, it was supposed to be five days, but it took three extra?

I got caught up with ideas and experiments, y’know? Appreciate it.

No, actually, maybe don’t notice. If you do, pretend you didn’t.

<b>

"…Er, if you don’t mind me saying, perhaps casting a stronger cleansing spell on yourself would be wise? You don’t want any unwanted trouble. And there’s a bathhouse in the center of town."

"…Thank you."

<b>

Am I that smelly? So smelly he recommended the bathhouse?

Fine, on my way back to Sorashidore, I’ll make my own bath in my storage space!

<b>

<b>

<b>

With that thought, I finally pulled my cart into Vearald.

The townscape isn’t too different, but it feels like there are more stone buildings here than in Sorashidore. Maybe because they’re resistant to the sea breeze?

<b>

First things first, let’s finish up this delivery job.

Casting a cleansing spell on myself, I searched for the Adventurers’ Guild.

<b>

I spotted a building similar to the guild in Sorashidore. …Ah, right, I can’t take the cart inside. No free parking lots around here, so I guess I’ll stash it in my storage space.

<b>

Let’s say I left it at the inn. Technically, my storage space is where I sleep.

<b>

<b>

Now, let me unveil my new technique.

<b>

First, imagine an ordinary street corner. Open up some space right there!

Turn the corner toward that space.

<b>

And just like that—poof! I’m out of sight!

<b>

<b>

Introducing: Optical Camouflage!

<b>

<b>

From the side, people don’t see me at all;

it’s as if I disappeared after turning the corner.

This way, I can blend in naturally and shake off any pursuers in town.

<b>

Not that I have anyone chasing me right now.

<b>

Just a simple application of spatial magic.

I didn’t spend those eight days hiding for nothing, you know.

…Though I’m not entirely sure how it worked. Just between us.

<b>

<b>

So, I stashed the cart in my storage space, grabbed the delivery box, and headed back to the Adventurers’ Guild.

<b>

"Hey there! Where should I drop off this delivery?"

"Oh, that box is from Sorashidore? Bring it here, please."

<b>

Called over by the lady at reception, I set the package on the counter.

<b>

"No signs of tampering… alright, received. Mission complete. Here’s your reward."

"Thanks! Also, where’s the Merchant Guild?"

"Just head right out of the guild and go a little way down that way."

"Thanks again!"

<b>

Yep, that was simple.

Everything went smoothly without anyone bothering me. This is how it’s supposed to be.

Apart from that one time with Blade-senpai when I registered in Sorashidore, nothing much happened.

<b>

<b>

Then I remembered the guard’s suggestion about the bathhouse.

…Surely, I’m not so smelly people don’t want to be near me… right?

<b>

…

Guess I’ll go to the bathhouse before the Merchant Guild.
