# I'm not just an elf being taken care of (From Dia's perspective)

<b>

<b>

<b>

It seems that Sister Karina is unwell.

She’s not even able to eat with us...

<b>

"Is Sister okay?"

"Ah, it’s no problem at all. If she just sleeps, she’ll definitely get better, so don’t worry about it."

<b>

Masiro, who is taking care of Sister, says this while eating stew, but I still feel a bit worried.

Should I go visit her as well?

<b>

"Please wait, Dia-sama. I think it’s better to refrain from visiting."

"Eh, is it that bad!?"

"…Ah, well. She’ll get better if she sleeps. There’s no danger to her life, but in a sense. Yes."

"Aishia is right. That girl might be a bit fatalistic in her thinking."

"Is it a mental illness!? Isn’t that a serious condition!?"

<b>

As I involuntarily stand up, Arthur pats me on the shoulder.

<b>

"No, Dia-chan. It probably just means that she did something a bit foolish and is suffering the consequences."

<b>

Arthur has become so accustomed to using the vocabulary that he can use it almost as fluently as speaking.

He seems to have mastered human language, as he writes and adds to it when he finds it lacking.

<b>

"Eh. Ah. Is that… what it means?"

"Yeah. Arthur seems to understand it better. As expected of a dragon."

"No, Dia-chan is just too pure. I must protect you...!!"

<b>

Hmm, I feel like I’m being treated like a child...?

<b>

"Well, just take it easy for two or three days. It’s not like we’re in a hurry on this journey."

"Well, it is a journey with a mission to save the world... but they say haste makes waste. I have no objections to waiting until Sister is in perfect health."

<b>

Well, that aside, I should go visit her.

If there’s no danger to her life, that’s good, right?

<b>

When it comes to visiting Sister, should I find something delicious in the town of Akahagane to bring her? A fascinating magical tool might also be good.

Since I’ve tamed a slime, that could work too.

<b>

Ah, that’s right! How about gathering information about the divine tools ahead of time!

<b>

Since Aishia-san will be taking care of Sister, it’s a good idea for me to gather information while I can, right?

<b>

"Ah, then I’ll accompany you, Dia-chan."

"Is that okay, Arthur?"

<b>

It’s reassuring to have the dragon Arthur accompany me.

<b>

"If I let you go out alone, Sister would get mad at me."

"Haha. I’m not a child, you know."

"If you’re not treated like a child, that would be a problem, right? Is it okay for you to be confessed to again?"

<b>

That’s right. I seem to look like a great beauty to the dwarves... It’s been proven in Aishia-san’s village, and even when booking a room, I received some suspicious glances...

<b>

...Considering that, it’s better to go outside dressed as a man. Yes.

If I’m seen as a boy, I’ll be treated like a beardless child, but it’s better than being surrounded by dwarf men.

<b>

<b>

"Well then, shall we head out?"

"Sure!"

<b>

After changing clothes, I set out for the town. I’m also equipped with a gun for self-defense.

Once I leave the base, I’m in the inn’s room. Once I leave the inn, I’m in the dwarf town of Akahagane.

<b>

"To avoid getting lost, I’ll make sure to mark our path!"

<b>

Arthur was rubbing his body against the corner of a building.

Let’s not mention that I thought for a moment he might be marking his territory like a dog.

<b>

"Now, when it comes to information, the tavern is the place to go..."

"Since it’s a dwarf town, it seems like there are taverns, but not really."

"All the regular diners are pretty much taverns."

<b>

Aishia-san would probably be more knowledgeable and efficient in investigating that area.

After all, Aishia-san is a half-dwarf bard. This country is like her home.

<b>

"Let’s look for a magical tool shop as well."

"Oh, that sounds good. If I sell even one scale, I can make some pocket money; I’ll give you one scale."

"Thank you, Arthur. But I do have some money with me."

<b>

I’ve received quite a bit from selling magical tools to Sister and from my helping fees.

...I’m not just an elf being taken care of!
