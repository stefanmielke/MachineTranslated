# I'm not just an elf to be fed (Dear's point of view)

Sister Karina said that she is not feeling well.

I couldn't even eat dinner with him. ......

<blank>

Sister, are you all right?"

I'm fine. Don't worry about it. I'm perfectly fine and I'm sure I'll get better as long as I sleep."

<blank>

Masilo-san, who took care of his sister, says so as he eats his stew, but I am still a little worried.

Should I go visit him here too?

<blank>

I'm afraid I must stop you from visiting me. I think it would be best if you did not visit me."

What, it's that bad?

I'll be at ...... uh, you know. I'll get better if I sleep. It's not life-threatening, but in a way. Yes."

She's right. He's a little lethal in the head."

'Are you sick in the head!　Isn't that a serious disease!"

<blank>

I stood up involuntarily, and Arthur tapped me on the shoulder.

<blank>

No, Dia-kun. Maybe she did something stupid and got what she deserved.

<blank>

Arthur has become so accustomed to using the vocabulary book that he uses it as much as he speaks anymore.

He seems to have mastered the human language, as he writes and adds his own words when they are missing.

<blank>

Eh. Ah. Is that what you mean by that kind of ......?"

Oh. Arthur understands better than me. You are indeed a dragon.

I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm sure it will work. We must protect her. ......!

<blank>

Mmm, I feel like I'm being treated like a child. ......?

<blank>

"Well, take it easy for a couple of days. We're not traveling in a hurry.

I'm on a journey with a mission to save the world,......, and it's said that haste makes waste. I have no objection to waiting until your sister is in perfect physical condition.

<blank>

Well, that's it, let me offer my sympathies.

If it's not life-threatening, it's good, right?

<blank>

<blank>

When it comes to visiting your sister, would it be a good idea to find something tasty in the town of Akahagane and offer it to her? It could also be an interesting magical tool.

You have tamed the slime, and I would like to see that relationship as well.

<blank>

Ah, yes!　How about we go ahead and gather information about the Divine Model?

<blank>

Since Aisia-san is going to take care of her sister, it's a good idea for me to gather information while I'm at it, right?

<blank>

Oh, I'll go out with you if you want.

Are you sure, Arthur?"

<blank>

It would be an encouraging place for Arthur the Dragon to accompany us.

<blank>

If I let him go out alone, Miss Koh will be furious with me.

I'm not a child either. I'm not a child either.

I'd rather not be treated like a child, wouldn't you?　Can't I just get a bunch of confessions again?"

<blank>

Yes, I was. I seem to be a very beautiful woman to the dwarves. ......I have already proven this in Isiah's village, and I remember they looked at me with some suspicion when I took up lodging. ......

<blank>

...... Given that, it's better to go outside dressed as a man. Yup.

If you are a man, you are treated like a child without a beard, but it is better than being surrounded by dwarf men.

<blank>

<blank>

Shall we go out then?"

I'm soooo excited!"

<blank>

After getting dressed, I headed out on the town. I also equipped myself with a gun for self-defense.

When you leave the base, you are in a room at the inn. When you leave the inn, you are in the dwarven town of Akahagane.

<blank>

I'll mark it well so it won't get lost!"

<blank>

and Arthur was rubbing his body gingerly against the corner of the building.

Let's not mention that for a moment I thought I was going to hook pee like a dog.

<blank>

Now, speaking of information, here's the bar: ......

It's a Dwarf town, you know. There seems to be no taverns.

All the regular diners are like bars."

<blank>

Aisia will be able to research that area in more detail and efficiently.

After all, Isiah is a half-dwarf bard. This country can be said to be her home.

<blank>

I'll look for a grimoire shop."

I'll give you one piece. If you sell even one scale, you can make some money.

I've got some money, too. But I have some money, too."

<blank>

I get a good amount of money for the magical tools I sold to my sister and for helping out.

I'm not just an elf to be ...... fed, I'm not just an elf to be fed, I'm not just an elf to be fed!
