# Here Comes the Dungeon

<b>

So, here we are at the dungeon.

Today, we’re tackling it with just three of us, without Sati-tan. After all, it’s our first collaboration, and I wonder how it will go. It’s safer without Sati-tan since we can fully utilize spatial magic.

<b>

In the center of Karkassa, there’s a rocky mountain surrounded by inner walls. The dungeon expands downward from a cave that opens there.

The dungeon is a cave-type dungeon, inhabited by monsters.

At the gate of the inner wall, there’s a reception area where you can show your adventurer guild certificate to gain entry.

<b>

“Hey, girls. Are you sure you’re okay with that equipment?”

“We’re fine, no problem. In this dungeon, it seems evasion is more important than defense.”

“Well, as long as you understand that. The entrance fee is one copper coin per person.”

“Got it.”

<b>

However, the slave Aisia was treated as a tool and was free as my accessory.

I had Aisia carry my backpack and act as a porter. The actual contents are stored using spatial magic, but it’s just for show.

<b>

<b>

Inside the dungeon, it was truly a cave with exposed rocks.

That said, it was spacious enough to swing a sword without inconvenience, and the footing was solid and relatively flat. If it were a spear, it might get caught.

Strangely, the cave wasn’t dark; it was bright. It seemed possible to explore without any light, but visibility wasn’t great. It felt odd that only my surroundings were brightly lit.

<b>

As I stepped into the dungeon, a humid, soft air wafted around. There was a mix of anxiety that monsters might suddenly emerge from the corners, ceilings, or floors.

In fact, there were mushrooms growing at the edge of the floor, which, when they grow, are said to turn into myconids and start walking.

…What are these mushrooms feeding on, I wonder? Mana or something like that?

<b>

“Hey, it’s a bit late to ask, but can you fight, Dia-kun?”

“It really is late to ask. I can use magic to a certain extent. Fire magic would be good for a dungeon, right?”

<b>

With that, Dia-kun took out a wooden staff about 50 centimeters long, roughly the length of a baton. It had a gem at the tip. Where did he get that? Oh, he borrowed it from Kumin-san.

So, wizards use those kinds of staffs, huh? I didn’t know that…

<b>

“Master, magic staffs are really expensive. They’re called magic catalysts.”

“Is that so? How much are they?”

“Um, let’s see, one, two, three gold coins… a lot!”

<b>

Hmm, Aisia is the type who thinks “more than three is a lot.”

I thought it was similar since Sati-tan is a merchant and can calculate well, but… right, there’s no compulsory education in this world.

<b>

“I think this staff was about seven gold coins. It reduces the magic power used by half, so you can cast double the spells.”

“Wow. That’s expensive, Dia-kun.”

“It’s not that expensive. It’s on the cheaper side for magic staffs.”

<b>

Yeah, that’s expensive, and it feels like a noble’s perspective. It’s expensive for a commoner like me.

<b>

<b>

“Master, can you fight as well as heal?”

“Now that you mention it, this is my first time seeing Karina-onee-san fight. I’ve seen the prey she’s defeated, though.”

“Hehe, I can handle the front line, back line, and mid line! Oh, I’m also good at scouting and carrying things!”

“Doesn’t that mean you can do everything?”

<b>

Yeah. I’m originally a spatial magician who can do anything solo.

<b>

“Well, today is just to observe the dungeon. It’s also to check what the two of you can do. When we go with Sati-tan, let’s make sure to divide roles based on today’s experience.”

“If Master is protecting us, then we can feel safe!”

<b>

That’s right. I’ll protect you, so you can test things out safely!

I won’t allow any surprise attacks either.

<b>

“There’s a crawler over there, so let me show my power by taking it down first.”

<b>

With spatial magic, scouting is as easy as breathing.

So, our first monster is a crawler, but… wow, it’s bigger than I expected. It’s about the size of a medium-sized dog. It’s munching on the mushrooms growing on the ground.

It seems to be omnivorous and attacks adventurers with paralysis poison.

<b>

“How should we take it down? Should we slice it? Crush its head? Or cut its nerves for a clean shape without external wounds?”

“Then, how about slicing it?”

“Okay.”

<b>

With a snap of my fingers, the crawler was sliced. A squishy sound as bodily fluids oozed from the cut… I wonder if this has paralysis poison mixed in.

<b>

“W-Wow, Master! The hard outer skin has been cut cleanly too!”

“I thought I knew about your magical skills, but it seems they work perfectly fine against living beings.”

“Rather, it’s magic for tormenting living beings… no, never mind. It’s thanks to my master.”

<b>

Thanks to the god’s tutorial, I’m all set for combat.

<b>

“Next, Dia-kun, you try fighting. What will Aisia do?”

“I can’t fight. I’ll stick to carrying things. I can do a bit of scouting with my bard skill, but I can’t compare to Master.”

“Oh. Is that the echolocation thing? That sounds good. Then I’ll have Aisia scout from now on.”

“Is that okay? It’s probably safer if you do the scouting, Master.”

“I can do anything, so I’ll take on the leftover tasks. Or do you not want to let me do all the work and let you relax?”

“N-No way! Then I’ll do the scouting!”

<b>

Alright, I’m counting on you.
