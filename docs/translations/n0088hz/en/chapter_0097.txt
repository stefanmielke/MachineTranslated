# The dungeon I came to

<blank>

So here we are, the dungeon.

Today, the three of us will attack without Sati-tan. It was our first time working together, so I wondered how it would go. It would be safer without Sati, since we could use all our spatial magic.

<blank>

In the center of Carcassa is a rocky hill surrounded by an inner wall. The dungeon extends down from a cave there.

The dungeon is a cave-type dungeon with monsters living inside.

There is a reception desk at the gate of the inner wall, where you can enter by showing your Adventurers' Guild card.

<blank>

"Hey, girls. Are you all right with that kind of equipment?"

I'm fine. I'm fine. In this dungeon, evasiveness seems to be more important than defense.

Well, I hope you know what you're getting into. The admission fee is one copper coin per person."

Aiyo."

<blank>

However, the slave Isiah was treated as a tool and was free as my appendage.

Such is the case with Isiah, who was made to carry my backpack and porter it. The actual contents are stored in spatial magic, but just for show.

<blank>

<blank>

The inside of the dungeon was truly a bare rock cave.

However, it is wide enough that it is not inconvenient to wield a sword, and the foothold is firm and relatively flat. If it were a spear, it might catch a stone.

Strangely enough, it is not dark inside the cave. It seems that you can explore the cave even if you don't have any lights, but the visibility is not good. It is strange that only one's surroundings seem to be bright.

When I stepped into the dungeon, there was a soft, humid air in the air. The air was filled with a mixture of anxiety that demons might come out and attack from just around the corner, from the ceiling, or even from the floor.

In fact, there are mushrooms growing at the edge of the floor, which, when they grow, will become myconids and walk away.

...... I wonder what these mushrooms grow on for nourishment?　Manna or something like that?

<blank>

Hey, now that you mention it, Deere, can you fight?"

It's really a little late for that, isn't it? I can use magic to the extent that I have a taste for it. For dungeons, fire magic would be good, right?"

<blank>

Dia took out a wooden cane about 50 centimeters long, about the length of a baton. It has a jewel on the end. Where did you get it?　Oh, Mr. Kumin gave it to me.

I didn't know wizards used wands like that. ......

<blank>

Aruji-sama. The magic wand is very expensive. It's called a magic catalyst."

"Really?　Well, how much?"

Uh, gold coins one, two, three ...... full!

<blank>

Hmmm, was Isiah a 'full of numbers above 3' people?

I was wondering if it was similar because Satitan is a merchant and can do a lot of calculations. ...... Well, there is no such thing as compulsory education in this world.

<blank>

'This was a wand that cost about seven gold coins, I think. It uses less than half the magic, so you can do twice as much magic."

"Wow. That's very expensive, Dear."

It's not that much. It's one of the cheaper magic wands."

<blank>

Yes, it's expensive and it's an aristocrat's way of thinking. It's expensive for me, a commoner.

<blank>

<blank>

Can the Anji-sama not only heal, but also fight?"

I've never seen Karina fight before. I've seen her defeat her prey.

I'm good at scouting and carrying baggage!　Oh, I'm also good at spotting and carrying luggage!

Isn't that the whole point?

<blank>

Yeah, I'm a space wizard who can do anything solo. I was originally a solo space wizard who could do anything.

<blank>

I'm just going to take a look at the dungeon today. "Well, today we are going to check out the dungeon and see what the two of us can do. When you and Sati go with me, let's divide up the roles based on what we see today.

If the Anji-sama is protecting me, I feel safe!"

<blank>

Oh yeah. I'll protect you so you can try it absolutely safely!

I don't forgive surprise attacks.

<blank>

There is one Crowler in the Achilles' heel, so let me take him out first to show you what I can do."

<blank>

Once you get into spatial magic, finding the enemy is as easy as breathing.

So, my first monster, a crawler. ...... Wow, it's bigger than I thought it would be. It's about the size of a medium-sized dog. It was eating mushrooms that grew on the ground.

They seem to be omnivores and will attack adventurers with their paralyzing venom.

<blank>

I wonder how I'm going to take it down. Slice it into rings?　Crush the head?　Or do I sever the nerves and make it nice and clean with no trauma?"

Then cut them into rounds?"

Hoi."

<blank>

With a snap of his fingers, the crawler was cut into a circle. Phew, bodily fluids flooded from the cut surface. ...... I wonder if this is mixed with paralyzing poison.

<blank>

The hard part of the epidermis has been cut cleanly!　Even the hard parts of the epidermis have been cut cleanly!

I thought I knew how good your sister's magic was at ......, but I didn't realize it could normally work against living creatures."

'Rather, the magic of tormenting living creatures ...... No, it's nothing. I had a good master."

<blank>

Thanks to God's tutorial, the combat side is perfect.

<blank>

What about Alicia? What about Isiah?"

I can't fight. I'll just be a baggage handler. With my bardic skills, I can search for enemies a little, but I'm not as good as you.

Oh. Echolocation?　Great, then I'll have Isiah do the spotting next time."

"Are you sure?　It would probably be safer if you were the one searching for the enemy."

'I can do everything, so I'll do the extra work. Or are you going to let me do all the work and make it easy for you?"

I'm sorry," he said!　Then, let me search for the enemy!

<blank>

Mm-hmm, please take care of it.
