# This is the House of Dragons.

He heads for the dragon's den while standing on the dragon's head.

It is said that orcs used to live in a cave in the mountains with goblins. I heard that they took it away.

<blank>

So this is the House of Dragons.

I'm going to go say something first!　I'll go say something first!

<blank>

The black dragon says hurriedly to me as I get off the dragon's head.

I'll protect her!　You're trying to tell me, but your legs are shaking. Cute.

<blank>

"Tsk, go on, get the hell out of here."

'Usus. ...... Oh, my honey. I have a visitor, may I speak to her?'

'Hey, darling!　Aashi, I'm hungry!　Do you want some food?

I'm sorry, I haven't caught it yet. I haven't caught it yet."

<blank>

A copper-brown dragon squeezed out of the cave.

I've got a boar right here. Let's give it to him.

<blank>

"Oh, do you have the boar we just took?"

I'm not sure if it's a real thing, but I'm sure it's a good idea!　Us, ah, ah, ah, ah!

What's up?　Someone's here. ...... hmm?　There's no one here.

<blank>

And a copper-brown dragon looking around. Hmmm, humans don't count, do they?

<blank>

Look, a wild boar.

I'm so happy to see you!　Usu!　Zassu!

<blank>

And when I gave the boar to the black dragon in front of her, she finally seemed to notice me.

<blank>

What?　A human is talking!　That's funny!　I mean, he's so petulant to humans, it's so lame. Darling, what's wrong?

'Baca!　This guy is from .........uh...well...yeah!　He's really strong!　We can't win even if we were all together!　Please be polite to him!

What about?　You're a human being, aren't you? ...... Ma?"

It's "Ma, Ma. Oh, you mean, 'Really? You mean, 'Really?'"

I'm not sure why you're speaking dragon!　I mean, how can you speak dragon?　Amazing!　Wow, that's amazing!

<blank>

His eyes sparkle and he flaps his wings.

What can I say, this dragon is so girly. Okay, let's call it a gal dragon.

<blank>

So, gal-dragon, have you requested any human sacrifices lately? Have you requested any human sacrifices lately?"

What?　Ikenier? ......What's an Ikenier?"

You know, the ones that make you turn in the culprit for punishment or something. And then, after that, they take the punishment without permission, right?

'Uh-oh. I ain't done that in the last 20 years or so?'

<blank>

Oh, is that so?

It doesn't look like they are lying. The dragon is not demanding ......?

<blank>

I mean, what's your name?　I'm not a gal-dragon, I'm a (untranslatable)!

I'm (untranslatable). Yes, by all means, tell me your name!

<blank>

Oops, I didn't catch the name part. It was the same with Arthur, but I guess that's because there is no human equivalent. I couldn't catch the name part, but it's probably because there is no human equivalent.

Names are as they are when said in a foreign language, so this is probably the correct translation.

<blank>

'Ummm, sorry. I have a hard time with those names, so let me call you Galdragon...... Galdra, Ikiridragon, and Kirigon."

I'm okay with that!　Galdra is so cute, isn't it?　I'll just call myself that from now on.

Kirigon? Yeah, it's not bad.

<blank>

They were delighted with my naming. I'm glad, because I'm often told I don't have a good sense of naming things like this!

<blank>

My name is Karina. Nice to meet you.

"Karina, right?　'Okay!　I'm so proud to meet someone who talks!"

'Oh, hey!　So this guy is ...... sorry, my girl is really sorry!

<blank>

Kirigon bows his head.

<blank>

I mean, my darling is really scared. Is Karina-chan really so tough?　Let's try a little battle, okay?

Oh?"　There is a part of me that seems to go against my heart to raise my hand to a pretty girl. So I'll go easy on you. Come on."

Okemaru!　Let's see how it goes first, Breath!

<blank>

Bgooo!　and a torrent of energy is released from Galdra's mouth.

But I twisted it with spatial magic and hit Kirigon.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to do.

Wow!　Wow!　I mean, it's okay darling. I'm sorry about my bracelet.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

<blank>

Kirigon is slightly dizzy. You could at least catch her breath.

<blank>

Can we have a power match or something?"

"Oh, I'll lift it up then. Here we go."

Wow!　Wow!　You're so tiny, yet so powerful!"

<blank>

Since it is physically impossible to carry Galdra in a princess's arms, he lifts her up with both hands and holds her up. Of course, this is spatial magic. The hands are just to hold her up.

<blank>

I'll heal Kirigon's wounds while I'm at it," he said. "Ei!"

I'm not sure how much Miss No.　No matter how much I hate her, human recovery magic doesn't work. ...... healed!

I'm not sure what to say!　Majimanjis!　Karina-chan is amazing!

<blank>

Ho-ho-ho, more praise. I'm the type of person who gets carried away and grows when I'm praised!
