# Here is the Dragon's House

<b>

<b>

Standing tall on the dragon's head, I head towards the dragon's lair.

It seems that this cave in the mountains was originally inhabited by orcs who had goblins under their control. They say it was taken from them.

<b>

"This is the dragon's house, huh?"

"Please don't just barge in out of nowhere!? I'll go say a word first!"

<b>

The black dragon hurriedly says to me after I get off the dragon's head.

She seems to want to say that she will protect me! But her legs are trembling. So cute.

<b>

"Tch, fine, just hurry up and go."

"Yes, um... Hey, my honey. We have a guest, can you talk to them?"

"Wait a minute, darling! I'm hungry! Where's the food!?"

"Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't caught anything yet."

<b>

A copper-brown dragon pops out from the cave.

There's a boar just right for the taking. Should I give it to her?

<b>

"Hey, do you want the boar I caught earlier?"

"Seriously!? Thanks a lot!"

"What's up? Is someone here... Hmm? There's no one here."

<b>

The copper-brown dragon looks around curiously. Hmm, I guess humans don't count.

<b>

"Here, the boar."

"Thanks! Yes! Thanks!"

<b>

As I give the boar to the black dragon in front of her, she finally seems to notice me.

<b>

"What!? A human is talking! That's hilarious! And you're bowing to a human, how lame. What happened to you, darling?"

"Idiot! This person is... um, well, yes! Super strong! Even if we all teamed up, we couldn't win against them!! Please treat them with respect!"

"Huh? But it's just a human, right? ...Really?"

"Really, really. Oh, 'really?' means that, right?"

"Wow! And why can you speak dragon language!? Amazing! Wow, amazing!"

<b>

Her eyes sparkle as she flaps her wings excitedly.

This dragon is quite girly. Alright, let's call her Gal Dragon.

<b>

"So, Gal Dragon-chan. Have you demanded sacrifices from humans recently?"

"Huh? Sacrifice? ...What was that again?"

"You know, the thing where you make someone take the blame for something. And then you make them take responsibility afterward, right?"

"Ah, I see. I haven't done that for about 20 years, though?"

<b>

Oh, is that so?

She doesn't seem to be lying. So dragons aren't demanding sacrifices...?

<b>

"By the way, tell me your name! I'm not just Gal Dragon, you know!"

"Oh, I'm (translation not possible). Yes, please tell me your name!"

<b>

Oops, I didn't catch the name part. It was the same with Arthur; there probably isn't a corresponding term in human language. Just sounds like gigi or gagi for the name part.

Names stay the same even when said in foreign languages, so this might be a correct translation in its own way.

<b>

"Hmm, sorry. That name is too difficult for me, so I'll call you Gal Dragon... Gal Dura, and Ikiri Dragon, Kirigon."

"Okay! Gal Dura sounds super cute, right? I'll just start calling myself that from now on."

"Kiri Gon, huh? Yeah, not bad."

<b>

The two of them are happy with my naming. I'm glad; people often say I have no sense for naming!

<b>

"My name is Karina. Nice to meet you!"

"Karina, huh? Okay! I'm going to brag about meeting a talking human!"

"Hey! So this person is... I'm sorry, my girl is really sorry!!"

<b>

Kiri Gon bows her head repeatedly.

<b>

"By the way, darling, you're really scared, aren't you? Is Karina-chan really strong? Can you fight a little?"

"Oh? Hitting a cute girl goes against my principles. So I'll hold back. Come at me."

"Okay! Then I'll start with a breath attack to check things out!"

<b>

With a roar, a torrent of energy is unleashed from Gal Dura's mouth.

But I twist it with spatial magic and send it towards Kiri Gon.

<b>

"Gyahhh!?"

"Wow! That's amazing! Are you okay, darling? Sorry for my breath attack!"

"N-no, it's nothing."

<b>

Kiri Gon is slightly wobbling. She should be able to handle a breath attack like that.

<b>

"Hey, hey, can we also do a strength contest?"

"Oh, then I'll lift you up. Here we go."

"Wow! That's amazing! You're so small but powerful!?"

<b>

I pick up Gal Dura in a princess carryâ€”well, that's impossible due to size, so I lift her with both hands. Of course, it's with spatial magic. My hands are just supporting her.

<b>

"I'll also heal Kiri Gon's wounds while I'm at it. Here."

"Huh? No matter how good you are, human healing magic shouldn't work... It's healed!?"

"Wow! Seriously!? Karina-chan is amazing!"

<b>

Hohoho, praise me more. I tend to get carried away when I'm complimented!
