# Did you bring the logs!? Ah! (Solo) ●Illustration Included

<b>

I am Karina! Having received a request for log collection, I have come to the designated area specified by the guild!

Here, I can chop down logs as much as I want, so I’m going to chop a lot☆

<b>

<b>

"As a point of caution, I shouldn't take from managed forests, huh? Well, that's obvious."

<b>

Managed forests are designed to safely harvest timber, and cutting down trees there is apparently a crime.

…The ones I cut before coming here in the mountains should be fine, right? That place was far from human settlements… and it seemed like it was in the territory of the Alchemy Kingdom… Well, I’ll keep quiet about that.

<b>

<b>

"If I were to spill the beans about spatial magic, I could chop down trees with the intent of stripping the mountain bare… but no, that wouldn’t be good either. It’s probably only okay if it’s at a personal level."

<b>

Duplicating a log after cutting one could be an option. It would be the exact same tree, so the duplication would probably be discovered… but if I copy them one by one and deliver them in a different town, maybe it wouldn’t be found out. It might get exposed by the type of wood… Until I handle timber as a merchant in the future, I’ll have to seal that idea.

<b>

"I’ll basically keep the spatial magic hidden… so I’ll go with the flow of making it look like I’m floating and pulling the logs with wind magic."

<b>

Carrying one log in each hand, I’ll probably be able to transport two logs at a time. If I can carry them once a day for two weeks, I’ll reach my target amount. Considering lodging costs, it might take a bit longer?

<b>

"Alright, decision made. Let’s get to it."

<b>

I quickly cut down two nearby trees, trimmed the branches, and turned them into logs.

Then, I just have to lift the logs with spatial magic and carry them under my arms—it's a simple job.

After that, I just need to walk back to the town of Solashidore… Actually, it’s a secret that I’m being carried by the floating logs.

<b>

On the way, a goblin attacked, so I whacked it with a log to silence it in terms of life activity, and I safely returned to the town.

"…So, here are the two logs delivered!"

"Magic is amazing… Oh, I was also able to confirm the proof of subjugation for two goblins. With this reward included… that’s two silver coins and one copper coin."

"Yay! At this rate, I’ll reach my target amount in no time!"

<b>

I thought it might take a bit for lodging costs, but with the bonus from the subjugation, it might not take too long.

<b>

"By the way, do you have a recommended inn? I haven’t booked one yet."

"Huh?… Oh, right, I was drinking with Blade-san all night yesterday. Um, as for a recommended inn for women… there’s the 'White Wood Witch Inn' which is five copper coins per night. Meals are separate, but they have private rooms with good security."

<b>

I thought about it, but lodging costs might still be quite high.

Hmm, five copper coins, huh.

<b>

"…Five copper coins is quite a bit."

"If you can earn that much today, it’s reasonable. Safety is worth it."

"Are there places to camp in the city or just outside the town?"

"Well, it would be in the slum area… It’s free to camp, but a beauty like you, Karina-san, would be prime prey, so it’s better to avoid it."

<b>

Slums. I see, that’s a thing. It seems better to stay away from there.

<b>

"There are dormitory-style inns for adventurers, but… a beauty like you, Karina-san, could still be attacked. I recommend a private room."

"Ugh. It seems my beauty has backfired here. My beauty drives everyone mad… what a femme fatale… and I didn’t even take a bath yesterday, is that okay?"

"Please use at least something like [Cleansing], you’re a magician after all."

<b>

There is that kind of life magic too. It can serve as a substitute for a bath, how convenient.

<b>

"Huh? Wait a minute… If I can secure safety and rest comfortably, then it’s sufficient as an inn."

"You can’t stay overnight in the adventurer guild."

"That thought never occurred to me. No, I thought I could manage it with magic."

<b>

Exactly. Speaking of places, it’s spatial. In other words, it falls under the realm of spatial magic.

I can enter the space I created and temporarily close the entrance and exit. As expected of the god's spatial magic, the flexibility is too wide.

<b>

Now that it’s decided, it’s time to shop for bedding and interior items!

<b>

"Alright. Then I’ll buy various things with today’s reward. Can you tell me where I can buy bedding and miscellaneous goods?"

"What exactly are you planning to do?"

"It’s a secret. Well, it’s not a crime or anything, and I won’t bother anyone."

<b>

Thus, I was told about stores where I could shop along with my reward. I’m going to create my own home!
