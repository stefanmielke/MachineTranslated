# You got the log!　Oh! (Solo) - Illustrations by.

<blank>

My name is Karina!　I was asked to collect logs, so I came to the area designated by the guild!

We can cut all the logs we want here, so we'll cut a lot!

<blank>

<blank>

As a precaution, you don't take it in a managed plantation, do you? Well, of course."

<blank>

Plantations are devised to take timber relatively safely, and it is apparently a crime to cut down trees there.

......Anybody cut in the mountains before coming here is okay, right?　That place was far from any human settlement,...... and if anything it looked like territory of the Alchemy Kingdom,...... well, I'll shut up.

<blank>

<blank>

I'd be willing to cut down a mountain with the force of a naked tree if I had to give it away about spatial magic. ...... No, that's a no-no. I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not.

<blank>

Is it possible to cut one tree and then duplicate it? The exact same tree would be delivered, so the duplicate would be discovered. ......1 I wonder if it would not be discovered if I made a copy of each tree and delivered it in a different town. The type of tree might give it away. ......It would be sealed until I handle the wood as a merchant in the future.

<blank>

I'm going to basically hide the fact that it's space magic. ...... I'm going to use wind magic to float the logs and pull them.

<blank>

If I carry one in each hand, I'll probably end up carrying two at a time, but if I carry one every day for two weeks, that's my goal. I wonder if it would cost a little more if we take lodging and other expenses into account.

<blank>

"Okay, we've decided on a policy. Let's do it.

<blank>

He immediately cut down two trees that were close at hand, removed the branches, and made them into logs.

And it's a simple job to lift the logs with spatial magic and carry them, holding them on both sides.

Now all I have to do is walk back to the town of Solacidore ...... Actually, between you and me, I'm being carried by a floating log.

<blank>

Also, along the way, a goblin attacked us and we returned safely to the town, even hitting it with a log to silence it bio-actively.

<blank>

"So ......, we've got two logs delivered!"

"Magic is amazing ...... Oh, and I also found a proof of defeat site for two goblins. Including this one, we have two ...... silver coins and one large bronze coin."

I was like, "Wow!　We'll reach our goal in no time!"

<blank>

I thought it might cost me the cost of lodging, but it might not take that long because of the bonuses for defeating the people.

<blank>

I haven't found a place to stay yet.　I haven't found a place to stay yet."

Huh?" ...... Oh, by the way, didn't I have a drink with Mr. Braid yesterday? Let's see, if you are looking for a recommended inn for women, ...... there is a place called "Shiroki no Witch Pavilion" that costs 5 large copper coins per night. Meals are not included, but the rooms are private and secure.

<blank>

I thought about it, but I still might have to pay quite a bit for lodging.

Hmmm, 5 large copper coins.

<blank>

...... five large copper coins, that's a lot of money."

If I can make as much money as I did today, I'll do it. There is no substitute for safety.

Is there a place in town, or just outside of town, where I can camp out?"

Well, it will be in a slum area. ...... If you stay in the field, it's free, but if a beautiful woman like Karina goes there, she'll be easy prey, so you'd better not go there."

<blank>

Slam. Is that what it's like? I guess I'd better stay away from it.

<blank>

"There are some sleeping quarters for adventurers, ...... but after all, if you are as beautiful as Karina, you might be attacked. I recommend a private room."

Hmmm. I'm not sure if my beauty has backfired here. My beauty drives everyone crazy, or what a magical woman ...... I mean I didn't take a bath yesterday, but I hope it's okay."

You should at least use [wash], you're a wizard."

<blank>

That's the magic of life, isn't it? It can be used as a substitute for a bath?

<blank>

Hmm?　Wait, ...... if it's a safe and secure place to rest, is it enough as an inn?"

You are not allowed to sleep in the Adventurers' Guild."

I didn't have that idea the other way around. No, I thought I could do something with magic."

<blank>

Yes. When I say place, I mean space. In other words, it is a category of spatial magic.

You can even enter the space you have created and temporarily close the entrance and exit. As one would expect from God's spatial magic, the range of flexibility is too wide.

<blank>

If you decide to do so, you'll be shopping for bedding and decor!

<blank>

Good. I'm going to buy a lot of things with today's reward. Tell me where I can buy some bedding and other things."

What the hell are you doing?"

It's a secret. Well, it's not like I'm committing a crime or anything, so I won't bother anyone.

<blank>

Thus I was given a store where I could shop along with my reward. I make my own home!
