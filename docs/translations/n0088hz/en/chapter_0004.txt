# What shall we do with ...... first?

<blank>

If you are to be a merchant, you must first purchase goods to sell.

Normally, I would need money to get started, but I have just arrived in this world, and there is no way I have that kind of money.

<blank>

But I can use spatial magic. And fortunately, the surrounding area is a forest, i.e. full of trees.

So with spatial magic, cutting, storing, and transporting trees are all no problem.

<blank>

Then we can sell the trees and make some money.

<blank>

Thanks to God's attentive tutorial, I know how to use magic.

It would be easier than cutting off the country.

<blank>

[Spatial disconnect]"

<blank>

As I chanted this, the trees around me snapped off.

It is possible to do it completely without chanting, but it is easier on the mind to say it out loud, and it also reduces the MP consumption. I don't know how many points it actually costs.

<blank>

During God's tutorial, there was an endless supply, but now there's a limit.

Well, it seems to recover if I sleep. I'm stingy, but I don't think I need to be.

<blank>

'Do we knock off the branches?'　[Spatial cutting]"

<blank>

The branches of the trees are cut off and made into logs. In no time at all, five logs are created.

<blank>

[Storage]"

<blank>

All five were then stored into the storage space.

Storage space capacity?　It seems to be able to hold at least everything on the surface of this planet. I guess you could say it's practically infinite.

<blank>

Ah.

I mean, it's too late now, but in the first place, I wonder if this body is okay in terms of status.

Family registers and the like are apparently counted well, though not as well as in Japan due to the per capita tax.

...... Hmmm, well, now that the alchemical kingdom ruled by the self-proclaimed god of chaos has been turned into a mess, we can get away with it if we can get out of that mess, right?

<blank>

Also, I forgot my own name in the family register.

<blank>

"I didn't think I'd have to start with my own naming. ...... Oh, I wish I'd thought of that while God was doing his tutorial."

<blank>

The name of my previous life ...... No, my body has changed so much from my gender, the same name would make it difficult for me to stay out of the male consciousness forever.

<blank>

Let's just give it a temporary name for now. If we come up with a better one later, we can change it. Carino, Kameh, or maybe Carina?

Also, ordinary commoners don't have a last name, but I've heard that merchants use their store name as if it were their last name, so I'll take that into account and say ...... Karina Shonin.

<blank>

Karina Shonin. Yeah, let's just go with that for now. ...... something feels more right than I thought it would, huh?"

<blank>

I wonder why. ...... Maybe because God made it just right or something?　Oh well.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, I, Karina Shonin, decided once again to go to the human village.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

Searching from the sky, the human village was easily found.

Or rather, it's just one shot if you follow the roadway extending from the Alchemy Kingdom. We could find a walled town on the plain, a so-called fortified city.

<blank>

According to basic knowledge, the name of the town is Solacidore. It seems to be a city in the Kingdom of Pavelkant, a neighboring country of the Alchemical Kingdom.

<blank>

Let's make this our first town!"

<blank>

<blank>

Here's how it's set up.

<blank>

The alchemical kingdom was destroyed by the wrath of God, so he fled in a panic.

He had just recently become a merchant in the Alchemy Kingdom.

I need some kind of job. I am willing to be a peddler if possible: ......

<blank>

...... Well, I can read and write arithmetic, and I can get a job somehow."

<blank>

Therefore, we will transition to the vicinity of the Solacidore's gate.

Fortunately, there was almost no pedestrian traffic.

<blank>

A wall as high as you can look up. A magnificent gate there.

There are soldiers guarding the gate packed in there. As I quietly peeked in, a soldier called out to me.

<blank>

IDs, please."

<blank>

Oh, ID. Damn, I don't have that. ......

<blank>

I'm sorry. I lost it. ......"

Now, if you'll excuse me.

Oh, no, I mean, I was attacked!

<blank>

I was about to be turned away by Assari, so I said so and bit down.

Then the soldier changed his expression and bit down.

<blank>

Tell me what happened!　Where were you attacked and by what?"

Oh, uh... It's an alchemical kingdom, but, you know, for, uh, God?　So, I guess I just dumped my stuff and ran away. ......"

"No?　Oh, no, Alchemy Kingdom ......"

<blank>

I just told a little bit of the truth, and the soldier ponders a bit.

The soldier, who was silent for a few seconds, nods and opens his mouth again.

<blank>

Are you of the Alchemy Kingdom?"

Uh-huh. Yes. My name is Karina.

I see. Come here. Let's hear the details."

<blank>

A soldier calls me into the stuffing room.

<blank>

Clang.

<blank>

And then I heard a locked door. Hmm?

<blank>

<blank>

Well," he said. You say Karina. Who are you?"

<blank>

...... perhaps this is an interrogation?

<blank>
