# First of all... what should I do?

<b>

If I want to become a merchant, I first need to procure goods to sell.

Normally, I would need capital, that is, some initial money, but—there's no way I have that kind of thing since I've just arrived in this world.

<b>

However, I can use space magic. And fortunately, the surroundings are a forest, meaning there are plenty of trees.

Using space magic, I can cut, store, and transport the wood without any issues.

<b>

"All I have to do now is sell that wood to make some money."

<b>

Thanks to the god's thorough tutorial, I understand how to use magic.

It should be easier than cutting through a country.

<b>

"【Spatial Cutting】"

<b>

As I chant that, the surrounding trees are swiftly cut down.

I could do it completely without chanting, but saying it out loud makes it easier to think, and it also seems to reduce the MP consumption. I don't actually know how many points I have, though.

<b>

During the god's tutorial, I was supplied infinitely, but now I have a limited amount.

Well, it seems like resting will recover it. I might be stingy, but it doesn't seem necessary to hold back.

<b>

"Do I need to clear the branches? 【Spatial Cutting】"

<b>

I cut off the branches and turn them into logs. In no time, five logs are ready.

<b>

"【Storage】"

<b>

And all five are stored in the storage space.

The capacity of the storage space? It seems like I could fit everything on the surface of this planet in it. I could say it's practically infinite.

<b>

Ah.

Actually, now that I think about it, I wonder if my status is alright with this body.

As for household registration, while it's not as strict as in Japan due to the head tax, it seems like they keep a proper count.

...Hmm, well, since the self-proclaimed chaotic god is ruling over the alchemical kingdom, which has become a mess, I might be able to blend into that chaos, right?

<b>

Also, I just realized I forgot my own name along with the household registration.

<b>

"I never thought I'd have to come up with my own name... Ah, I should have thought of one while the god was giving the tutorial."

<b>

My previous name... no, since my body has completely changed in gender, having the same name would make it hard to shake off my male consciousness.

<b>

For now, I should give myself a temporary name. I can change it later if I think of something better. Karino, Kame, no, maybe Karina?

Also, ordinary commoners don't usually have surnames, but merchants seem to use shop names like surnames, so I should consider that... I'll go with Karina Shonin.

<b>

"Karina Shonin. Yeah, this should be fine for now. ...Somehow, it feels surprisingly fitting?"

<b>

I wonder why... maybe it's because the god made it up randomly? Well, whatever.

<b>

<b>

Anyway, I, Karina Shonin, have decided to aim for the human settlement again.

<b>

＊　＊　＊

<b>

Looking from the sky, I easily found the human settlement.

In fact, just following the road extending from the alchemical kingdom led me straight to it. I was able to find a town surrounded by castle walls on the plains, a so-called fortified city.

<b>

According to basic knowledge, the town's name is Sorashidore. It seems to be a city in the neighboring country of the alchemical kingdom, the Pavelkanto Kingdom.

<b>

"Let's make this the first town!"

<b>

<b>

Here's the setup.

<b>

The alchemical kingdom was destroyed due to the wrath of the gods, so I hurriedly escaped.

I had just become a merchant in the alchemical kingdom the other day.

I want a job. Ideally, I would like to become a traveling merchant...

<b>

"Well, I can read and write arithmetic, so I should be able to find some work somehow."

<b>

With that, I teleport near the gates of Sorashidore.

Fortunately, there were hardly any people around.

<b>

The walls towered high above. There stood a magnificent gate.

Soldiers were stationed to guard the gate. As I peeked in, one of the soldiers called out to me.

<b>

"Show your identification."

<b>

Oh, right, identification. Damn it, I don't have anything like that...!

<b>

"Um, I'm sorry. I lost it..."

"Then please leave."

"Ah, no, um, I was attacked!"

<b>

I said that to push back as I was about to be easily turned away.

Then the soldier's expression changed, and he pressed me for more information.

<b>

"What do you mean? Tell me in detail! Where and what were you attacked by?"

"Uh, well, it was in the alchemical kingdom, and um, by a god? And I kind of... dropped my belongings and ran away..."

"Huh? Ah, I see, the alchemical kingdom..."

<b>

As I accidentally revealed a bit of the truth, the soldier pondered for a moment.

After a few seconds of silence, the soldier nodded and opened his mouth again.

<b>

"Are you from the alchemical kingdom?"

"Um, yes. My name is Karina."

"I see. Come this way. I want to hear your story in detail."

<b>

I followed the soldier into the guardhouse.

<b>

Click.

<b>

I heard the sound of a lock clicking. Hmm?

<b>

<b>

"Now then. You said your name is Karina. Who are you?"

<b>

...Could this be an interrogation?
