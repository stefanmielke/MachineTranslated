# What was that unnatural surrender? (General beastman's point of view)

<blank>

Kalina beat King Barbaros, who was the heavy favorite to win, and General Garou, who was the favorite.

Two spectators who had bet on Kalina as a donation thought they should have bet more when they saw her win, but were somewhat relieved to see her lose against Misha.

<blank>

I thought maybe we'd win, but we didn't."

I didn't expect Misha to win. I never thought Misha would win."

<blank>

In the end, both King Barbaros and General Garou were defeated, so the game for the evening's drinks that had been going on between them was drawn and split.

Misha lost in the finals as usual. The winner was Prince Ur, son of King Barbaros, but needless to say, he was not happy to be on the podium.

<blank>

"......"

"......"

No, no, no!　What was that unnatural surrender?

Right?　Right?　I'm sure he had enough time to do that!　It wasn't like he had a little extra time left, it was more like he lost on purpose!

<blank>

Then they both shouted about Kalina, who surrendered, as if she was satisfied with just popping Misha's buttocks.

Kalina was in fourth place, an unplaced fourth place, because she shrugged off the third-place match and ran away. However, based on her record, all we can say is that she is probably actually in first place.

After all, he had replaced King Barbaros in 11 consecutive battles.

<blank>

You killed King Barbaros in the blink of an eye!"

Lash out at General Garowe!"

What do you mean, "I'm running out of energy with my butt-pen-pen, so I'm giving up?"

Misha was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

The two of them yell "ze, ze, ze" and catch their breath.

<blank>

"Actually, maybe that was just an excuse, maybe you ran out of magic?"

"The weapon was a special flying weapon, and maybe he was out of ammunition. ...... He hit everyone but General Garou normally. ...... If you say he used the weapon because that was on the edge of running out of magic, well... ......"

<blank>

And as best I can, I will consider the defeat of Karina's player favorably.

Still, I was not convinced because Kalina was showing a relaxed and comfortable style of fighting from start to finish. There is a limit to how much you can favorably take.

<blank>

'Let's change the subject. What was the ...... about that shiny statue of God?　I've never heard of a statue of a god glowing.

I don't have any either. Moreover, you had a big fight after the match. There was a referee who said, "Aren't you angry because Karina fought like a joke?　I heard one of the judges saying something like, "I think she's upset because Karina fought like a joke.

I don't get it. When you see that light, you know it's a light of joy. ...... So you don't know why, or ...... you understand it with your soul?"

<blank>

This made him even more puzzled. How could God be pleased with a fight with that content? ...... Well, in the end it was decided that it was a strange and unusual fight, and they must have had a good laugh.

<blank>

And. Well, thanks to that, even more so - since Kalina had also disappeared - Misha's attention was drawn to her, her game was spread, and her name recognition increased in the direction of being tilted.

<blank>

Misha became famous as the woman who was spanked and pleased God.

<blank>

I hear it's been given the nickname "The Ass That Pleases God."

What's that great ......?"

<blank>

He was originally a talented player who made it to the semi-finals of the tournament, so it's appropriate that he has two names, but ...... buttocks.

That's how big the impact of the match was. ...... butt.

<blank>

<blank>

'Daaaaahhhhhh ！！！！　Annya-roo!　I'm gonna kill you, aaaaah!"

<blank>

What a rumor to get the word out.

Just then, a rough-and-tumble feline beastie - Misha player - came to the bar. Probably his companion was a family member, probably his father. And he said his parents had come to watch the game.

They were drinking and noticed Misha and quietly listened.

<blank>

Hey, hey, hey, Misha. It's time to calm down, I thought you said God was pleased with you."

Even if it is!　No, that's why, Nyapa!　I wanted to please God with a more decent fight!　Hey, hey, hey. ......"

<blank>

Misha sits at the counter crying.

<blank>

They were like, "Please let me slap your butt instead of shaking your hand, or let me pet your butt!　We're the runners-up in the tournament, and they're all crazy!

<blank>

That makes me feel a little sorry for them. But I can't help but feel for those who ask.

<blank>

It's all Carina's fault... ...... kill her!

"Don't just say, 'I'm going to kill you,' because that would be a crime if you actually attacked me?"

I know, Papa!　I'll go to the tournament he's going to and kill him head-on!　Or I'll give him a letter of responsibility and we'll arrange a duel!

<blank>

For a moment I thought it was a reporting case, but it was just a healthy challenge.

She must be a good girl at heart. That is why Misha's fight must have pleased God.

<blank>

I'm going to spank him this time!

That's my girl! You're no match for ......, though, are you?　You were totally played, you know that?"

I promise I won't tell you that!　I promise not to tell you that. ......　Oh, I got a lot of fight money, so I'll buy you a drink today!　I'm the runner-up, so don't be shy, eat up, Daddy!"

Oh, that's nice!　That's great, let's have a treat. Thanks, Misha."

Ehehe!"

<blank>

Misha is patted on the head by his father. Her face was smiling.

They were relieved to see the good family relations and listened to the conversation.
