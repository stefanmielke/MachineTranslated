# What was that unnatural surrender!? (General Beastman Perspective)

<b>

The player Karina, who defeated the favorite King Balbaros and the most popular General Garou.

Two spectators who had bet on Karina as a way of donating were watching her advance and thought they should have bet more, but upon seeing her lose to Misha, they felt somewhat relieved.

<b>

"Wow, I thought she might actually win, but she really didn't."

"Yeah. I never expected Misha to win."

<b>

In the end, both King Balbaros and General Garou were eliminated, so the bet between the two for their evening drinks ended in a draw, resulting in a split bill.

After that, Misha lost in the finals. The one who won was Prince Ul, the son of King Balbaros, but it goes without saying that he had a puzzled expression on the podium.

<b>

"......"

"......"

"No, no, no! What was that unnatural surrender!?"

"Right!? Right!? There’s no way she didn’t have any leeway! It’s not just that she had some energy left, it’s like she intentionally lost!!"

<b>

And the two shouted about Karina's surrender, satisfied after giving Misha a smack on the behind.

Karina skipped the third-place match and fled, resulting in a forfeit at fourth place. However, given her performance, one could only say she was effectively in first place.

After all, she had fought eleven consecutive matches in place of King Balbaros.

<b>

"She took down King Balbaros in an instant!"

"She toyed with General Garou!"

"To surrender because she was exhausted from a butt smack, what does that even mean!?"

"Misha was soooooo hot!!"

<b>

The two shouted, gasping for breath.

<b>

"Maybe that was just an excuse, and she was actually out of magic power?"

"Her weapon was a special projectile, so maybe she ran out of ammo... She was just punching normally against everyone except General Garou... If it’s said that she used her weapon because she was barely hanging on, well..."

<b>

And they tried their best to consider Karina's defeat in a positive light.

Still, they couldn't shake the feeling of dissatisfaction, probably because Karina had shown confidence throughout the fight. There’s a limit to how positively one can interpret things.

<b>

"Let’s change the subject. What was up with that statue glowing? Even if it was a divine match, I’ve never heard of a god’s statue glowing."

"I haven’t either. Plus, there was a huge fuss after the match. Some judges were saying it was because Karina fought in a ridiculous way that the god was angry."

"That’s not it. Seeing that light, you could tell it was a light of joy... It was like I was made to understand why... like I understood it with my soul."

<b>

Thanks to that, they were even more perplexed. What does it mean for a god to be pleased with such a match? In the end, it was concluded that "it was a rare and unusual fight that made them laugh."

<b>

So, well, because of that, and since Karina had also disappeared, attention turned to Misha, and the match content spread, increasing her notoriety in a way that made people tilt their heads.

<b>

Misha became famous as "the girl who pleased the god by smacking her butt."

<b>

"I heard she got the nickname 'Butt that Pleases the God.'"

"What even is that? Is it amazing...?"

<b>

It’s reasonable for someone who made it to the semifinals to get a nickname, but... a butt?

That match must have been shocking enough to warrant it... but a butt?

<b>

<b>

"Ahhhhhh!!!! That little brat! I’m going to kill her!!"

<b>

Speak of the devil.

Just then, a riled-up cat beastman—Misha—entered the tavern. Her companion was probably family, likely her father. She had mentioned that her parents came to watch the match.

The two who had been drinking noticed Misha and quietly eavesdropped.

<b>

"Hey, hey, Misha. Calm down a bit; they said the god was pleased, right?"

"Even so! No, that’s exactly why, Dad!! I wanted to please the god with a proper fight!! Oh, come on..."

<b>

Misha sat at the counter, crying.

<b>

"To ask to smack my butt instead of a handshake or to let them stroke my butt! I’m the runner-up of the tournament, yet all I get are these crazy people!!"

<b>

One couldn’t help but feel a bit sympathetic. However, it was also easy to understand the feelings of those asking.

<b>

"It’s all that Karina’s fault... I’m going to kill her!!"

"Killing her is a crime if you actually attack her, so don’t do that, okay?"

"I know, Dad!! I’ll enter the tournament she’s in and kill her face-to-face!! Or I’ll challenge her to a duel with a formal letter!!"

<b>

For a moment, it seemed like a case for the authorities, but she was just a healthy challenger.

She must be a good girl at heart. That’s why Misha’s fight surely pleased the god.

<b>

"Next time, I’m going to smack her butt!!"

"Alright, that’s my daughter! But, realistically, aren’t you outmatched? You were completely toyed with."

"Ugh!! That’s a promise not to say...! Oh, I got a lot of fight money, so I’ll treat you today! Since I’m the runner-up, don’t hold back and eat a lot, Dad!"

"Oh! I’m so happy; let’s feast! Thanks, Misha."

"Hehe!"

<b>

Misha’s father patted her head, and she looked proud.

Seeing their good family bond, the two eavesdropping felt warm inside.
