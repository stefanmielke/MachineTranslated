# Case closed, I guess?

I'm like, "...... Huh, what the heck?　What the hell am I ......?"

"Oh, Kaoru. You woke up. Good morning."

Damn, I didn't expect them to turn it around from there ......!"

I'm so glad I gave it to Carina!　Thanks to the file I gave Kalina!"

<blank>

And when Kaoru's consciousness returned, there was a bound maid homunculus and Misha laughing high in the air. And there was me, holding the rope that had captured the maid in my hand.

<blank>

Hmm?　What?　Did I get released from custody?　When did I catch you in reverse and ...... Oh, no, no?　I used the file Misha gave me to get out of the restraints, and then I reversed ...... the restraints on the maid homunculus, right?

<blank>

Something's clouding my memory ......."

Oh, that's not good. It is indeed a demon's dependent. It seems the chaos is not working so well."

Did you do something?"

No?"

<blank>

The maid homunculus does not appear to be lying.

<blank>

...... because of that white caterpillar?"

Oh. This is a strange thing. It's not possible for a human-shaped sacred object made by the god of time and space to be effective against an insect of that size, is it? Also, that thing is actually defective in that it won't fit through the hole.

<blank>

Hm?　Oh yeah, that's what you call a difference in the rank of the divine. Yeah, surely it wouldn't work if it was that. ...... Oh, did you get out of it because you didn't want to be brain-chewed by a quicksilver worm?

Yes, it was. No doubt.

<blank>

I've figured out you're behind all this. I know you're behind this. I'll turn you over to God and my work is done. I'm glad I got to you in time. ...... I should be able to petition for Kaoru's sentence to be commuted."

Oh. For God's sake, Karina, I didn't call myself that!"

I will create the god of chaos, I will be the mother of the god of chaos, don't get in my way. I will create the God of Chaos, I will be the mother of the God of Chaos, don't get in my way."

<blank>

Perhaps because it is a homunculus, it seems to lack emotion and is somewhat false - but it can't be, and the truth is that this guy was definitely the mastermind behind the whole thing.

Once again, Misha tightens the bindings and I call out to the maid homunculus.

<blank>

If you deliver the sacred artifact to the god while thrusting it out, you will get a lot of SP. I'll dedicate a whole lump of sacred artifacts like you to the gods.

"I see that ...... our internal lie-detecting goddess, the 'true liver,' is unresponsive ...... true. Well then, please do me a favor."

<blank>

What's that divine device? Liver. Internal organs are built into ......?　No, they're internal organs, so of course they're inside the body. Is there a divine organ in there too? ......

<blank>

I guess that settles it, huh?"

"Ha-ha-ha!　Karina, you're on a field trip until you get home, right?"

'Yes, you're right there, Cat. Be on your guard, Carina!"

I said, "Oh. So, where's the church near here?"

<blank>

I want to deliver it quickly. When I asked Kaoru with this feeling, he shook his head.

<blank>

No, there are no churches of that god in this country. You would have believed in that thing of chaos. ......"

That's not an option. ......

'No, it's normal, right?　It was useful to get holy water to use for alchemy materials. Let me show you around, come on, carry me."

<blank>

Seriously. And you're the one who said that, maid homunculus. You're a very special guy.
