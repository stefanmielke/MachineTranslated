# Is it settled?

<b>

<b>

“...Huh? What am I...?”

“Hey, Kaoru. You’re awake. Good morning.”

“Ugh, I can’t believe I got turned around from that point...!”

“Nyahaha! Thanks to the file I gave to Karina!”

<b>

As Kaoru regained consciousness, he found a bound maid homunculus and Misha cackling. And there I was, holding the rope that had captured the maid.

<b>

Huh? Wait? Was I released from my restraints? When did I get captured in turn... Oh, no, wait, that’s not it? I escaped my bindings with the file I got from Misha and captured the maid homunculus instead... right?

<b>

“I seem to have some confusion in my memory...”

“Oh dear, that’s not good. As expected of a vessel of the demon. It seems the chaos isn’t working well on you.”

“Did you do something?”

“No?”

<b>

The maid homunculus doesn’t seem to be lying.

<b>

“...Is it because of that white caterpillar?”

“Oh? How unusual. There’s no way a bug of that level could affect a humanoid artifact crafted by the god of time and space. Also, that thing is actually a defective product that can’t fit into the hole.”

<b>

Huh? Is that so? Is it the difference in the rank of artifacts? Yeah, if that’s the case, it wouldn’t work... Ah, right, I did escape because I didn’t want to be brain squished by a bug, didn’t I?

Yeah, that’s right. No doubt about it.

<b>

“Well, it’s fine. I’ve figured out that you’re the mastermind. If I turn you over to the god, my job will be complete. I’m glad I made it in time... I should be able to wish for a reduced sentence for Kaoru too.”

“Yeah. Please, Karina, I haven’t introduced myself!”

“Ugh, l-leave me alone. I’m going to create the chaos god, I will be the mother of the chaos god, don’t get in my way!”

<b>

Perhaps because she’s a homunculus, her emotions seem lacking, making her words sound somewhat insincere—yet, it can’t be helped; it’s undeniable that she is the mastermind.

Misha tightened the bindings again, and I called out to the maid homunculus.

<b>

“If I turn you in along with the artifact, I’ll get plenty of SP. I’ll offer a chunk of an artifact like you to the god.”

“...My internal organ lie detection artifact, ‘Liver of Truth,’ is unresponsive... So it must be true. Well then, please take care of it.”

<b>

What kind of artifact is that? The liver? Internal organs... inside the body...? Well, it’s an internal organ, so it should be inside the body, but still. There’s an artifact in such a place...

<b>

“Is this settled then?”

“Nyahaha! Karina, the field trip isn’t over until we get back, you know?”

“That’s right, just like that cat said. Don’t let your guard down, Karina!”

“Ah. So, where’s the nearest church around here?”

<b>

I want to make the delivery quickly. With that feeling, I asked Kaoru, who shook his head.

<b>

“No, there’s no church for that god in this country. They probably worshipped that chaos thing...”

“Well, that can’t be helped...”

“No, there is one, actually? It was convenient for getting holy water used in alchemy. Let me guide you, now carry me.”

<b>

Seriously? And you’re the one saying that, maid homunculus? What a pious one.
