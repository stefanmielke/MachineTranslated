# Is it really safe ......?

I'm Karina!

A girl who, on second thought, wonders if the option of a bowl of rice topped with a bowl of dwarf sisters might be an option!

I want to be sandwiched between a legal Lolita and a legal Lolita. I want to have a harem with them on both sides.

If I had Dia-kun ride on top of it like a quilt, it would no longer be a complete loli harem. ......!

<blank>

You are ornamental, ornamental, ornamental.

Well, when I woke up this morning, I was really, you know, that thing.

It was a small futon, so I was ...... sucking that ...... long prong of Dear's, you know, in my mouth. He did it in his sleep, sleepwalking ...... elf-ear-sucking.

<blank>

Thanks to this, he didn't make eye contact with me this morning. I'm sorry, I'll put you in a better mood. Oh, you're just too embarrassed to make eye contact?　And it wasn't my ears that were embarrassed, it was ......

...... Uh, yeah. It was hitting my thighs, that's for sure. But no, morning physiology is inevitable. Yeah. I understand. It's a sign of good health. It happens even if you don't feel like having sex.

While eating a breakfast sandwich of mushrooms and crab-like things on bread, Sati and I talked about the future.

<blank>

So, Sati, how long will you stay in Carcassa?

I'll be here for at least two more days because I'm going to join the regular trading corps.

<blank>

There is a merchant corps that hires a joint escort to move around, and you pay a fee to join them and take advantage of the flight.

Essentially, a solo merchant or an individual who wants to go to another town would move between towns relatively safely by participating in this kind of thing. We ignore them, though.

<blank>

Where's the crunch?"

I'm going to dive in the dungeon for now. I've already booked a place to stay for a week, so I'll just call myself Karina the Adventurer for the time being.

I'll go with you. I want to go hunt for snacks."

<blank>

What, Satitan is also the type of person who knows how to be skillful?

By the way, Sati-tan, you are also an adventurer who is a solo peddler. ...... How strong are you really?

<blank>

Satie has a reputation as a drunkard," he said. He is quite famous among the locals.

"Hey, sister Ai. I'm embarrassed, stop it. I'm not a bad drinker, you know.　I have skills like that.

<blank>

Satitan seemed to be a user of the "drunken fist" skill, in which the drunker you are, the stronger you become. Drinking alcohol also strengthens the body and increases speed. So, alcohol is gasoline, huh?

And I hear that the weapons are iron liquor bottles that are wielded like mace or nunchakus.

<blank>

If I go with you, I'll ask you to show me. ...... Don't friendly fire me, okay?　They'll know we're in invincible mode and super hard.

<blank>

This crab-like dish is delicious. The sour sauce is good, too. What kind of meat is it?

'Boiled Silk Spider leg meat, I see. The sauce is made from horse milk and acid from the armored ant!　The mushrooms are also dungeon myconid, Sir.

"Spiders and ants and walking mushrooms......... delicious. Yeah."

<blank>

Aisia, I heard that you did your best to find a delicious sandwich with local ingredients that looks like a Carcassa specialty. It was actually delicious, so I commend her for a job well done.

<blank>

"Yeah,...... crunchy, that's what you've been eating?　Oh no, don't kiss me for a while, okay?"

Wait a minute. Which one?　Which one is out of Satitan's way?　Spider legs?　Crawlers though?"

It's Armor Ant's acid. It dissolves iron, too.　It will melt your teeth.

<blank>

It is said to be a large ant with an outer skin like iron armor that melts iron ore and eats it. They are said to be quite popular as prey because they can be processed directly into shields and armor.

<blank>

"They say it's safe because it's been processed and diluted properly, sir."

I see. But I'll make sure to brush my teeth later, Isiah and Dia."

<blank>

I can fix it if it dissolves a little, but cavity prevention is important. Worst case scenario, it's implants with space magic. ......

<blank>

Hmm?"　I mean, can I kiss Sati-tan after a while?"

?"　You're crunchy with me. Fine."

Sati, wait a minute. What is your relationship with the Master?"

'...... play lover?　Hey, Crunchy."

Oh, oh!"

<blank>

Wow, I'm getting out of the "no girlfriend = age" phase. I'm impressed. Just for fun.

<blank>

Oh, your sister was dating Mr. Satie?"

I'm not so sure. Hehehe, isn't she a sweetheart?"

......The elves really don't get my jokes. I'm not going to have a full day. I really can't do this for the rest of the day."

<blank>

Yann, I hugged his shoulder and he pushed my face away with his little hand. I like him.

<blank>

...... Well, they say they prefer the color of heroes."

Ha. Don't worry, Dear!　My love is for you too!　Let me suck your ear again!"

So, that's ...... ugh. Ha, yes ......"

<blank>

Dia-kun nodded with a red face. Is it okay? I'm going to do it,....... Is it really safe to suck the ears of a beautiful girl for viewing,......?
