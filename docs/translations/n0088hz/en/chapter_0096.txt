# Is it really safe...?

<b>

<b>

I’m Karina-chan!

When I think about it, maybe the option of a dwarf sister harem isn’t so bad after all!

I want to be sandwiched between legal lolis. I want to have a harem with them on both sides.

And if I could have Dia-kun ride on me like a comforter, it would completely be a loli harem...!!

<b>

But Dia-kun is for viewing, just for viewing.

<b>

Well, when I woke up this morning, it was really that, you know.

It was a narrow futon... so, um... I ended up sucking on Dia-kun’s long protrusion with my mouth. Apparently, I did it in my sleep while half-asleep... sucking on his elf ears.

<b>

Thanks to that, he wouldn’t look me in the eye this morning. I’m sorry, please cheer up. Huh, you can’t look me in the eye because you’re embarrassed? And what you were embarrassed about wasn’t the ears, but...

...Ah, yeah. It was definitely hitting my thigh. But hey, morning physiological reactions can’t be helped. Yeah, I get it. It’s actually a sign of good health. It can happen even if it’s not a lewd feeling.

While eating a sandwich with mushrooms and crab-like things in the breakfast bread, I’m discussing future plans with Sati-tan.

<b>

“So, Sati-tan, how long are you staying in Karkassa?”

“Hmm, I’m curious about Ai-nee too, and since I’m joining the regular merchant caravan, I’ll be here for about two more days.”

<b>

There’s a caravan that hires joint escorts to travel, and you can join by paying a participation fee.

Originally, solo merchants or individuals wanting to go to another town participate in this to move relatively safely between towns. We’re ignoring it, though.

<b>

“What about Karikari?”

“For now, I’m planning to dive into a dungeon. I’ve booked an inn for a week, so I’ll be adventurer Karina-chan for a while.”

“Maybe I’ll accompany you. I want to hunt some snacks.”

<b>

What? Sati-tan is also the type who has skills?

Speaking of which, Sati-tan is also an adventurer who does solo merchant work... I wonder how strong she really is?

<b>

“Master, Sati has the nickname ‘Drunken Demon.’ She’s quite famous in the area.”

“Wait, Ai-nee. That’s embarrassing, so stop it. Karikari, it’s not that I have a bad drinking habit, okay? I just have that kind of skill.”

<b>

It seems Sati-tan is a user of the ‘Drunken Fist’ skill, which makes her stronger the more she drinks. Drinking enhances her body and increases her speed, it seems. Is alcohol like gasoline?

Moreover, she swings a steel liquor bottle like a mace or nunchaku.

<b>

If I go with her, I might ask her to show me. ...Please don’t friendly fire, okay? It would reveal that I’m in invincible mode and super tough.

<b>

“By the way, this crab-like thing is delicious. The sour sauce is just right. What kind of meat is it?”

“It’s boiled leg meat from a Silks Spider. The sauce is made from the acid from Armor Ants and mare’s milk! The mushrooms are from the dungeon, Myconids, Master.”

“Spider, ant, and walking mushroom... it’s delicious. Yeah.”

<b>

Aisia seems to have worked hard to find a delicious sandwich made from local ingredients that look like Karkassa specialties. It was actually delicious, so I’ll praise her for a job well done.

<b>

“Eh... Karikari, were you eating that? No, please don’t kiss me for a while, okay?”

“Wait a minute. Which one? Which one is out for Sati-tan? Spider legs? But Crawlers are okay?”

“It’s the acid from the Armor Ant. That stuff can dissolve iron, you know? Your teeth will melt!”

<b>

It seems to be a large ant with an outer skin like iron armor that can dissolve iron ore and be processed into shields or armor, making it quite popular as prey.

<b>

“They say it’s okay because it’s properly processed and diluted, Master.”

“...I see. But let’s make sure to brush our teeth properly later, Aisia and Dia-kun too.”

<b>

Even if it melts a bit, I can heal it, but preventing cavities is important. Worst case, I could use spatial magic for implants...

<b>

“Huh? By the way, can I kiss Sati-tan after a while?”

“? We’re close, Karikari. It’s fine.”

“Wait a minute, Sati. What kind of relationship do you have with Master?”

“...Just a playful lover? Right, Karikari?”

“O-oh!”

<b>

Oh no, have I really broken my record of having no boyfriend? I’m moved. Even if it’s just for fun.

<b>

“W-wait, did you date Sati-san, big sister?”

“Yeah, it seems that way. Hehe, isn’t she a cute lover?”

“...Elves really don’t get jokes, huh? Wait, don’t get so close, Karikari. I seriously can’t handle it today.”

<b>

Yikes, when I pulled her shoulder closer, she pushed my face away with her small hand. I like that.

<b>

“...Well, they say heroes are fond of beauty.”

“Ha! It’s okay, Dia-kun! My love is directed at you too! Let me suck on your ears again!”

“T-that’s... ugh. Y-yes...”

<b>

Dia-kun nodded with a red face. Is it okay? I’m really going to do it... Is it really safe to suck on the ears of a beautiful girl meant for viewing...?
