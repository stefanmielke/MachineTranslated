<b>

Yes. It's Karina-chan.

Once again, my memory has completely vanished, so let's check the current situation. Um, is this a room in an inn?

Scattered clothes and the adorable dwarf Sati-chan snoring softly with a "kupee."

And look at us, both in casual camisoles.

<b>

Yeah.

I really messed up!!

<b>

"Fuh, ah... huh?"

<b>

Sati-chan woke up!

<b>

"…Good morning."

"Good, good morning. Sati-san."

"Sati-chan, right? We're close like that, aren't we? Wow, yesterday was so much fun. I ended up drinking too much."

<b>

Sati-chan, Karikari!? What is that, we're super close!!

<b>

"I'm sorry, Sati-chan. My memory is blank. What happened?"

"Huh!? Ah, so you're that type. What a waste. Well, I had fun though."

<b>

Hehe, Sati-chan laughs mischievously.

Is she a mischievous girl!? Is she a mischievous girl!?

<b>

"You should be careful not to get tied into a slave contract while you're drunk, Karikari."

"What happenedーー!?"

"Well, I was the one who suggested we drink in the room. But I was surprised when you suddenly started taking off your clothes. Oh, and you kissed me."

<b>

Waaah! I really messed up!!

This is Sati-chan's inn! And I'm the one who got taken home!!

No, was it me who attacked!?

<b>

"And then, um, well… (mumble mumble) …and then."

"With your mouth!? Wow, um, I'm sorry…"

"That mouth kissed me… mmm, don't worry about it. I was the one who made you drink too."

<b>

With my inhibitions gone due to alcohol, I might have become a pervert on the same level as a god.

Alcohol is really scary. Not having any memory at all is also bad.

<b>

"When traveling, it's common to get pushed down while drunk, so a kiss is just a greeting. Well, I do sell high-priced items to those who push me down."

"Huh? Sati-chan. My backpack is stuffed, but what's inside?"

"Yeah, it's the alcohol you bought from me yesterday. You bought me a drink, so I'm very satisfied. I love you!"

<b>

Sati-chan comes closer and gives me a peck on the cheek.

Whoa, whoa, I got kissed! It was soft! Oh no, my face is turning bright red!

<b>

"Wow, so you act like this when you're not drunk. Karikari, you're really cute."

<b>

And she gently pets my head. Her tiny hands are stroking me!

I'm being toyed with, toyed with...!

<b>

<b>

"Um, um... I'm sorry..."

"Really. I opened various first-time doors... By the way, could you return my socks? Where did you hide them?"

<b>

I suddenly realized that a rag—not a rag, but socks—were stored in my storage space.

...And they're perfectly time-stopped! What great skill!?

This must be a divine message to deliver them as they are.

<b>

I leave the socks as they are and replicate them to pull out from my clothes.

Then, I dramatically pull out the replicated socks as if I took them from my cleavage.

<b>

"Ah, I'm sorry. It seems like something got stuck in here, ugh, it smells."

"Hey!? Don't say that!? You forced me to take them off! You were so happy yesterday!"

<b>

With a flushed face and slightly teary eyes, Sati-chan protests.

This is definitely a favorite of the gods. No doubt about it.

...Rather, combined with how skillfully it was done, there might be a suspicion that a god has possessed me?

<b>

"Ugh, the cleavage, the cleavage... Dwarves are usually small in that area, so I'm not jealous. But I really searched for them there. Well, I'm just glad to get them back. Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning..."

"I'm sorry, Sati-chan...!"

<b>

Because I accidentally said it smelled, Sati-chan casts a thorough cleaning spell.

Well, yeah, it wasn't that smelly, but the sharp smell made me... rather, I thought it was rich and delicious, which is definitely because of this body. Damn you, god.

<b>

And I'm really sorry, Sati-chan! I have to deliver the socks to the god!!

Delivering a copy is bad, but delivering the original should be fine!!

<b>

Regarding the socks to be delivered to the god, it's totally fine to swap the original with the copy, please!

<b>

"Hey, doesn't my foot smell stick to your chest? Make sure to clean it properly, okay? ...I won't know if it gets itchy, you know?"

"Huh, are you saying you have athlete's foot?"

"Athlete's foot? What's that, a leech or something? No, the smell gets trapped, right?"

<b>

Hmm? Could it be that there are no athlete's foot bacteria in this world...!?

<b>

<b>

...There's a possibility that the god thoroughly eliminated them!

<b>

<b>

Well, if I don't get athlete's foot, that's actually great!

It's incredibly beneficial for a traveling merchant!! Well, I have spatial magic, though.

I can make the ventilation in my shoes good to avoid moisture.
