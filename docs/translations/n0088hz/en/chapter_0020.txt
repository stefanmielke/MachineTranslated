<blank>

Yes, I am. That's Karina.

Today, my memory has once again jumped, so let's check the current situation. Let's see, is this a room in an inn?

Sati, a dwarf, snoring cutely "kupi" on the scattered clothes.

And here we are, both in rough camisoles.

<blank>

Yeah.

You've done it!

<blank>

"Huh, ah ...... ah?"

<blank>

Satitan woke up!

<blank>

...... good morning."

Oh, ohayo gozaimasu. Mr. Satie."

Sati-tan, right?　Me and crunchy. Well, we had a lot of fun last night. I drank too much.

<blank>

Sati-tan, crunchy!　What's that, they are super close!

<blank>

I'm sorry, Satyan. I'm having trouble remembering. What happened?"

Eh!　Oh, you're that type, huh? That's a shame. Well, I was entertained, though."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Sati-tan laughs mischievously.

Is it the female brat attribute!　Is it a female brat attribute!

<blank>

I better make sure Crunchy doesn't sign me up for a slave contract while I'm drunk.

What's going on?

I was the one who invited him to have a drink in the room. I was surprised when he suddenly took off his clothes. He also gave me a kiss.

<blank>

Wow!　I'm still fucked!

This is Sati-tan's lodgings!　And I am being taken home!

No, I'm the one who attacked you!

<blank>

"And then there's, uh, you know, ......, and then..."

With your mouth!　Wow, that. I'm sorry. ......"

I was the one who got the mouthful. ...... Never mind. It's my fault for making you drink it.

<blank>

I have been unhinged by alcohol, and perhaps I have become a pervert on the same level as God.

I'm really scared of alcohol. It's bad enough that I have no memory at all.

<blank>

When I'm traveling, it's not uncommon for people to get drunk and push me down, so I just say hello to them. Well, I often sell my goods at a high price to those who push me down.

Hmm?"　Satitan. My backpack is getting kind of stuffy... what's in it?"

Yes, that's the drink that Crunchy bought from me yesterday.　"Yes, Carikari bought a glass of alcohol from me yesterday, and I'm very happy with it. I love it.

<blank>

Sati-tan came up to me and squeezed my cheek.

Wow, wow, it was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo soft!　It was so soft!　Oh, man, I'm turning red in the face!

<blank>

I guess that's what happens when you're not drunk. Crunchy is really cute.

<blank>

And he gently nudges my head. His tiny hands are stroking me!

I'll be a pawn, I'll be a pawn. ......

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ......

I've opened a lot of doors for the first time. I opened the door for the first time in many ways. ...... I mean, can I have my socks back?　Where did you hide them?"

<blank>

Ha, I realized that I had rags - not socks - stowed away in my storage space.

...... And it's perfectly time-stopped!　How deftly done!

This must be a sign from God to deliver the product as it is.

<blank>

I leave that sock in place, duplicate it and put it out in my clothes.

Then, as if he had taken it out of his cleavage, he slyly pulled out a sock that duplicated it.

<blank>

I was like, "Oh, I'm sorry. I was in here somewhere, and it stinks."

"Hey, hey, hey!　Don't say that!　You forced me to take off my clothes!　You were so happy yesterday!"

<blank>

Satitan, blushing and a little teary-eyed, makes an appeal.

This is already God's favorite food. No doubt about it.

...... I suspect that God is coming to possess you, coupled with the fact that you've been rather too good at it, right?

<blank>

I'm not disappointed because dwarves are usually tiny in that area. I was looking for it so hard. I'm glad you got it back. Wash, wash, wash: ......

Sorry Saty Tan ......!"

<blank>

Sati-tan applies a cleaning spell just to be sure, perhaps because she unintentionally said it smelled bad.

No, yes, it didn't smell that bad, but it's definitely my body that made me think that the pungent smell was rather ...... rich and delicious. Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

<blank>

And I'm really sorry Sati-tan!　I have to deliver socks to God!

It is not allowed to deliver a copy, but it should be allowed to deliver the original copy!

<blank>

Only for socks to be delivered to God, it is possible to replace the original with a copy!

<blank>

"Hey, is my foot smell sinking into your chest?　You should wash them properly. I don't care if it itches ......?"

"Oh, you don't mean to tell me you have athlete's foot?"

"Myssid?　What is that, a leech or something?　No, the stinky thing is disgusting, isn't it?"

<blank>

Hmmm?　Don't tell me that athlete's foot fungus doesn't exist in this world: ......!

<blank>

<blank>

It's possible that ...... God has thoroughly erased this one!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, if you don't get athlete's foot, it's rather good!

I am so grateful to be a peddler!　Well, I have space magic.

I can do things like make the inside of the shoes more breathable so they don't get stuffy.
