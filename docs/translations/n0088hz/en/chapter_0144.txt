# Are the Dwarves Doing This Nationwide?

<b>

Well then. With that said, we’ve done everything we needed to do in Calcas, and we’ve decided to head to our next destination.

<b>

To be precise, we have already set off.

The 'Healer' was guarding the core deep within the dungeon, but the 'Karina Shonin Party' is said to be heading to the next destination after leaving the town.

<b>

<b>

And the next destination is the Dwarf Kingdom—Aisia and Sati-tan's hometown.

The trigger was Aisia's nostalgic story.

<b>

<b>

～・～・～・～・～

<b>

"By the way, my lord. There’s an incredibly strange weapon in my hometown."

"Oh? What kind?"

"It’s a hammer that can destroy castle walls. However, it has no effect on anything else, and it doesn’t leave a scratch on the fences of nearby houses."

"What’s that? That’s weird."

<b>

～・～・～・～・～

<b>

<b>

…Such a strange item is undoubtedly a divine artifact!

<b>

Moreover, unlike in dungeons, it’s a weapon specifically designed for destroying castle walls and is useless for daily life.

It’s like they’re telling us to go retrieve it. Of course, we’re going to go.

<b>

With that light-hearted attitude, our trip to the Dwarf Kingdom was decided.

There’s nothing else that needs to be prioritized. It’s a perfect guideline. …Huh? Socks? Well, that’s because it’s important to cherish encounters when we get there. The gods must be seeking that kind of thing too.

<b>

<b>

Since we’re going to the Dwarf Kingdom, we also thought about reporting our survival to Aisia’s family.

Sati-tan probably wouldn’t do something like that, according to Aisia.

… I think so too. Right now, she’s definitely preoccupied with elven liquor.

<b>

<b>

"So, since it’s about time we should be nearing the border, is there anything we need to be careful about?"

"Well, it’s better to have plenty of alcohol; that would make them happy."

<b>

Aisia answered like that. …Maybe I should have bought a bit more alcohol.

The crawler liquor I procured as Karina Shonin is only what Sati-tan made me buy.

<b>

"Huh? If you’re short on alcohol, should I go buy some? Just as a side task for myself."

"Oh, is that okay? Then I might ask you to do that later; I’ll pay for the alcohol and the labor."

"I don’t mind just covering the alcohol cost. I owe Karina a lot."

<b>

Masahiro-san takes a bath every day. It’s become a daily routine to change the water.

<b>

By the way, while you need a license for large-scale trade, it’s perfectly fine to buy a bit more alcohol for personal consumption and settle it among friends.

It’s also okay to sell one or two bottles to individuals. It’s completely off the books, though.

<b>

"Oh, that’s fine. In the country I was in, dwarves don’t need a license to buy and sell alcohol."

"Huh? Really?"

"To be precise, they insist to merchants that 'this is not alcohol, it’s flavored water,' claiming that 'this is not an alcohol transaction.'"

"That’s ridiculous."

<b>

Are the dwarves doing this nationwide with euphemisms like barley juice or rice juice?

<b>

"If someone says, 'That’s not water!' then the Dwarven way is to drink it like water to prove it’s water. If they manage to drink it all, it becomes the treat of the person who pointed it out."

"…The laws are pretty lax, huh?"

"Of course, it doesn’t work outside the country, so a few dwarves get punished and have their alcohol confiscated near the border every year."

<b>

But it seems that this actually works quite well in the Dwarf Kingdom.

How lax.

<b>

"Sati said she got caught once because of this."

"Sati-tan…"

<b>

I couldn’t help but feel exasperated.

However, it seems she grew from that to becoming an apprentice to a liquor merchant, obtaining a license, and receiving a liquor bag from her master.

<b>

"Well, of course, things like fire liquor, which 'even dwarves can’t drink like water,' have to be treated as alcohol, but everything else is generally treated like juice. It’s very lenient."

"Fire liquor, is that a thing?"

"Karina, I want to try fire liquor too. If you get some, sell me a bottle."

"Sure, I’ll sell it to you at cost."

<b>

Also, it seems that there are times when what you think is juice at restaurants turns out to be alcohol, so I hope Dia-kun will be careful.

Also, for Street Fighter 6, I’m almost at level 20 with a bond of 100 with my master. Sorry.)
