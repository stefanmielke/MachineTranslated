# Are you doing this on a national level, Dwarves?

Well. So, having done our rounds in Carcassa - we decided to head to our next destination.

<blank>

To be precise, they have already left.

The "Healer" was escorting the core deep into the dungeon, but "Karina Shonin and her party" were supposed to be leaving town and heading to their next destination.

<blank>

<blank>

And the next destination is the land of the dwarves - the home of Isiah and Satitan.

It all started with Isiah's memories.

I have a very strange weapon in my hometown. There is a very strange weapon in my hometown.

"Oh, yeah?　Like what?"

It is a mallet that can destroy castle walls. However, it has no effect on anything other than the castle walls, and it can't damage the walls of your neighbors' houses or anything else.

What's so funny?

<blank>



<blank>

<blank>

...... such a funny substitute is definitely a godsend!

<blank>

And unlike dungeons, they are not useful for life, like weapons that specialize in destroying castle walls.

It's like I'm asking you to collect this stuff. I will, I'm going to.

<blank>

With such light-heartedness, the decision was made to go to the Land of the Dwarves.

I don't have anything else to prioritize. Just a good guideline. ...... Eh, socks?　That's the kind of thing I'm looking for, you see, the kind of thing that makes local encounters important. God must be looking for something like that.

<blank>

<blank>

Since we were going to the Dwarf country, we also discussed the possibility of reporting our survival to Isiah's parents' house.

I'm sure Satitan won't do that kind of thing," said Isiah.

...... I agree. I'm definitely all about the elf drinks by now.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm about to reach the border in a few days, so I'm going to go.

'Yes, a lot of booze would be appreciated.

<blank>

Isiah replies. ......I guess I should have bought a few more drinks.

The only crawler liquor I bought as Karina Shonin was what Sati-tan made me buy.

<blank>

Hmm?　If you don't have enough liquor, I can get some for you.　I'll get some for myself."

I'll pay you for the drinks and the trouble.　Then I'll ask you sometime, and I'll pay for the drinks and the hassle."

I don't care if it's just for drinks. Carina has taken good care of me.

<blank>

You take a bath every day, don't you, Mr. Masiello? To the extent that changing the hot water is part of your daily routine.

<blank>

Incidentally, you need a license to engage in large-scale commercial transactions, but it is perfectly acceptable to buy a little more alcohol for personal consumption and settle the bill among friends.

When selling, it is OK to offer one or two bottles to an individual. It is a complete diversion, though.

<blank>

Oh, it's all right. In the country I was in, dwarves don't need a license to sell or buy alcohol."

What?　Really?"

"More precisely, by insisting to the merchant that 'this is not liquor, it is flavored water,' he is claiming that 'this is not a liquor trade.'

That's ridiculous."

<blank>

Are you a nation of dwarves with wheat juice, rice juice, or some other such cloak-and-dagger?

<blank>

' 'That's not water!' If you are told, the Dwarf way is to drink it like water to prove it's water and show it's water, no problem. If you drink it all safely, it's on the house of the person who pointed it out."

"...... legal gov't, huh?"

Of course, it doesn't work outside the country, and I hear that a few dwarves a year are often punished and have their liquor confiscated near the border."

<blank>

But in Dwarven lands, it seems to go over rather well.

I'm so gaga!

<blank>

Sati said he got caught once in the past for this."

"Saty Tan Sah ......"

<blank>

I was taken aback.

But I heard that he grew from there to becoming an apprentice to a liquor merchant, obtaining a license from him, and being given a liquor bag by his master.

<blank>

The only way to treat it is as an alcoholic beverage, but other than that, it is generally treated as juice. It's loose."

Fire wine, is that what they call it?"

Carina, I would like to try some of that fire wine, too. If you get it, please sell me a bottle.

Okay, I'll sell it to you at cost."

<blank>

Also, I would like you to be careful at restaurants, because it seems to happen often that a drink is served instead of a glass of juice.

(Sorry, I haven't finished the book publication process yet. Sorry for the irregularity.

Also, I'm almost at the 20th level of 100 bonding with my master in one way or another on strike 6. (Sorry).
