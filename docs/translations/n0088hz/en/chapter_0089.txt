# Arrival of Carcassa!

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, no!

With Karina-chan's quick wit, we managed to get through the tsk-tsk about how it was strange that the jar was not broken, and we managed to reach Carcassa.

Thank you Mr. Healer!　I owe everything to Mr. Healer!

<blank>

Yes, the magic engine car "Star-kun No. 2" is now set to become smaller with the mysterious magical power of Mr. Healer. Mr. Healer is very useful.

And, although Dia has developed a magic circle for this purpose, it is a genuine decoration that does not really work. In reality, they are just replacing the models.

<blank>

It seems that I don't have enough knowledge to generate mysterious phenomena. I wish I had a new textbook.

<blank>

Would it be considered self-praise for sister Karina to praise the healer?"

Isn't it good that you're still the best?"

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, Carcassa has arrived!

<blank>

Carcassa is a town in the wilderness. It has two walls, with a dungeon inside the inner wall. The houses and stores are like doughnuts.

Houses made of clay magic bricks and stones line the streets, and although there are some fields, vegetables are basically imported from other towns. Meals seem to consist mainly of meat from the dungeons.

<blank>

Well, let's get a place to stay for now.

...... hmm?　Come to think of it, I haven't stayed at an inn in this world ...... yet, have I?

I've been in this world for over a month now and I'm still on ......!

And that's because spatial magic is too useful, thank you very much.

<blank>

Not knowing how to get lodging, I decided to leave it to Isiah, who seemed to have a lot of experience.

<blank>

I wonder if I can get a nice private room to stay?　I wonder how much it would cost.

If only I had a silver coin. Oh, should I split the room, Aruji-sama?"

'No, we'll be fine in the same room. There's storage space anyway, and I'll just put a door leading to it. It could even be a single room."

Oh. I see. Aruji-sama's magic is so useful!"

<blank>

Right?　It's the most powerful and useful spatial magic!

<blank>

Then I will sleep on the floor, and you and Dear will have a single room with one bed.

Oh, I'd like to try some of the specialties here for dinner, so that's what I'd like to try."

Is it a specialty of Carcassa? ......If it hasn't changed since I came here a long time ago, there's not much to it. Crowler baked goods and such are the specialties, though......"

<blank>

Crowler. One hit for Mr. Basic Knowledge. Isn't that a big caterpillar from the ...... dungeon? Can you eat it?　Oh, you can eat it?　You can eat it. ......

<blank>

What's it like at ......?"

They are not inedible, but they are a delicacy. The dried ones resemble kraken fillets. The taste is, well, like cheese without the saltiness. The less processed ones can be tangy with residual venom. It's not the kind of poison that causes a stomach ache, but it does numb you."

<blank>

Some people like to be numbed, and some deliberately leave the poison behind.

Hmmm...just a sip of something scary is enough, I guess.

<blank>

I'd rather eat oak meat, my Lord.

Honesty is good. I will prepare the oak steaks separately. I will go to the merchants' guild to find a good place to sell honey, and you and Dia will look for a place to stay.

I understand. I will look for you with safety as my priority, sister.

'Yes, we are, poof, only girls.

<blank>

In case you haven't noticed, today, Dear, is the day to dress up as a boy. I'm not sure. It looks like a girl in a ponytail dressed as a man.

<blank>

I'll keep track of where you two are, so call me if you need me. I'll come running right over!"

Yes, sir. Take care, sister."

Well, sir, I'll see you later.

<blank>

Oh, that reminds me, I also have to deliver a request to the Adventurers' Guild to carry a cargo.

I'll also deliver it and accomplish the request.
