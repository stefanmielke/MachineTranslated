# Arrival at Karkassa!!

<b>

<b>

That was close!

Thanks to Karina-chan's quick thinking, we managed to overcome the question of why the jar wasn't broken and finally arrived at Karkassa.

Thank you, Healer! Everything is thanks to you!

<b>

By the way, the magical engine vehicle "Star-kun No. 2" has been set to shrink thanks to the mysterious magical powers of the Healer. Seriously, the Healer is so convenient.

For that, we also had Dia-kun develop a magic circle that looks the part, but this one is just a genuine decoration that doesn't actually work. In reality, we are just swapping it with a model.

<b>

It seems we lack the knowledge to create mysterious phenomena. I want a new textbook.

<b>

"Does it mean that when Sister Karina praises the Healer, it's self-praise?"

"It doesn't change the fact that Master is the best, so it's probably fine?"

<b>

<b>

Anyway, we have arrived at Karkassa!!

<b>

Karkassa is a town located alone in the wilderness. It has double walls, and inside the inner wall, there is a dungeon. The area with residences and shops is shaped like a donut.

Houses made of earth magic bricks and stones line the streets, and while there are some fields, vegetables are mainly imported from other towns. Meals seem to mainly consist of monster meat obtained from the dungeon.

<b>

Well then, let's find an inn for now.

...Huh? Speaking of which, I haven't actually booked an inn in this world yet...!?

It's been over a month since I came to this world...!?

All of this is truly thanks to how convenient space magic is.

<b>

Not knowing how to book an inn, I decided to leave it to the experienced Aisia.

<b>

"Aisia, do you think we can get a nice private room? How much do you think it will cost?"

"Just one silver coin will be enough. Ah, should Master have separate rooms?"

"No, it's fine to stay in the same room. We have a storage space anyway, so we can just leave a door leading to it. It would be fine even for a single room."

"Oh. I see. Master’s magic is really convenient!"

<b>

Right? Space magic is incredibly useful!

<b>

"Then I'll sleep on the floor, and Master and Dia-sama can share a bed, making it seem like a single room."

"Oh, I want to try the local specialties here, so I hope there’s something like that."

"The local specialties of Karkassa... If it hasn't changed since I came here before, there isn't much worth mentioning. Crawler grilled is a specialty, but..."

<b>

Crawler. One hit for basic knowledge. ...Isn't that the big caterpillar that appears in the dungeon? Can you eat it? Huh, you eat it? You can actually eat it...

<b>

"...What’s it like?"

"It’s not inedible, but it’s a delicacy. The dried ones resemble pieces of kraken. The taste is... well, it’s like cheese without salt. If not processed properly, some poison may remain, giving it a slight kick. It’s not a poison that causes stomach pain, but it does cause numbness."

<b>

Some people intentionally leave some poison because they like the numbness.

Hmm, just a bite out of curiosity seems sufficient.

<b>

"I prefer to eat orc meat, Master."

"That's a good choice. I'll prepare orc steak separately for you. Now, I'm going to ask at the merchant guild about a good place to sell honey, so could you and Dia-kun look for an inn?"

"Understood, I'll prioritize safety while searching, Sister."

"Yes, we only look like girls at first glance."

<b>

Today, Dia-kun is dressed as a boy, though. Yeah. He looks like a girl with a ponytail dressed as a boy.

<b>

"I'll keep track of your location, so if anything happens, call me. I'll come right away!"

"Yes. Please be careful, Sister."

"Well then, Master, see you later."

<b>

Oh, speaking of which, I also have to deliver the cargo request to the adventurer's guild.

I'll deliver it and complete the request while I'm at it.
