# Differences in Labor

<blank>

I'm Karina!　I'm here to bring you some Solacidore honey!

<blank>

I sold the honey from Solacidore to the merchant guild in Carcassa for 20 silver coins for one large jar. 80 silver coins for four.

Includes bottles, so a profit of 9 silver coins per bottle. Profit of 36 silver coins!

<blank>

Something very peddler-like!

<blank>

Well, there are ways to earn money by delivering goods as an adventurer, but I still like to earn money by flowing goods from right to left like this.

What do you call the difference in labor?　The nature of the work. You mean I'm earning money?

<blank>

<blank>

You know, defeating demons with spatial magic and delivering the goods is totally dependent on spatial magic, isn't it?

Without spatial magic, nothing would start. It's more like spatial magic is using me.

<blank>

On the other hand, this exchange of goods is my achievement. I don't need spatial magic.

It's like I'm using spatial magic to have fun in a hard place.

<blank>

<blank>

I guess that means "I'm not sure I want to be icky with the power of the 'gotcha' ......".

Honestly, it's a minor difference, and in the end, spatial magic is still awesome and useful.

<blank>

<blank>

What better place to stock up here and sell elsewhere?"

I can only get what I can get from the dungeon. Even crawler meat sells reasonably well elsewhere.

<blank>

When I gathered information while unloading honey, I got the answer, "Well, that's right. Rather, there are only dungeons in Carcassa.

Conversely, pretty much any material from the dungeon would be for sale. As a ...... merchant, it would be like buying them and selling them elsewhere.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Hmmm... I feel like I'm being too subtle!

<blank>

That's it. I don't mean to sound like a demon material, but it's a material you can easily catch yourself if you use spatial magic.

Going out of your way to buy it and sell it somewhere else is some kind of ...... charity?　I don't care if it's a kid from an orphanage or something. I'd leave that kind of thing to someone else.

<blank>

"Do you have any processed products?　Processed food."

"So, it could be a painkiller or something like that. Since it is a medicine made from demon venom, you need a license to handle it in earnest, but a couple of bottles for your own use will be fine.

<blank>

Anesthesia. If it's not addictive, I don't know if I'd mind having a bottle of it.

Apparently it can be done by boiling the water used to detoxify crawler meat with medicinal herbs. Hehe.

<blank>

Oh," he said, "there are aphrodisiacs. There's such a thing as aphrodisiacs."

Hou. Is that an aphrodisiac ...... that's safe?　Won't the 3,000x sensitivity make my head go poof?"

If it were that bad, we wouldn't be able to sell it. What do you mean, 3,000 times more sensitive?

<blank>

If not, that's okay. ...... What, one bottle costs 20 silver coins?　That's expensive.

Oh, but some nobles pay 50 silver coins for it. Heh. I heard that even if you bring it to the merchant guilds around Velarde, it will be worth 30 silver coins.

<blank>

...... I wonder if it would be a little too expensive for a souvenir for my sister Harumikazuchi.

Hmmm ......

......No problem!　I'll think about the details later!

I made money on honey, bought two bottles and one is a souvenir for my sister!

<blank>

I'll buy two bottles and you give me a little discount. Thirty silver coins."

I can't do it so cheaply, we're losing a lot of money. Thirty-eight silver coins."

Thirty-five silver coins!"

If you want to buy me something else, I'll give you 36 silver coins.

<blank>

Oops, you've seen through the drop-off point beautifully. I thought I was just about to get it right with exactly the amount of profit I made.

<blank>

I'll buy some processed goods that I can sell somewhere else for 40 silver coins. Then I'll buy some processed goods for 40 silver coins that I can sell elsewhere.

I'll take that as a yes. I recommend the dried meat of crawlers, which can be found in large quantities in the first level of the dungeon. The smoked ones can last for six months.

"Oh, that's the kind of processed food I was looking for."

<blank>

So the Shonin budget of 80 silver coins is,

<blank>

2 aphrodisiacs : 36 silver coins

Mithril knife : 13 silver coins

Painkiller : 2 silver coins (for 2 bottles)

Crowler's smoked meat: 5 silver coins (20 x 6 sets)

Bowstring : 5 silver coins (equivalent to 5 strings)

Silk spider cloth: 15 silver coins (equivalent to 2 shirts)

---------- ------

Total : 76 silver coins

<blank>

and the remaining money was four silver coins.

It seems that this dungeon has insects such as crawlers and silkspiders. Also, I heard that mithril can be picked.

<blank>

'Well, it was a good deal. You should come back, sweet things like honey are welcome. We get bees here in the dungeon, but honey is rare. The demand for honey is high because you can get it so cheaply.

They gave me a fraction of a pound and a set of dried meat. I knew I would not be disappointed with an introduction from the merchants' guild.

That's right. If you are a little stingy and lose referrals from the guild, you will lose money. If they knew that, they would be honest in their dealings. ...... But, being a merchant, I will charge a little more if you don't negotiate properly.

<blank>

As long as there are things to sell, the more peddlers, the better, apparently. The owner of the store is a ...... man who looks at the big picture of profit, not the immediate pennies.

<blank>

And then another peddler came along.

He is petite, so much so that the backpack he carries is larger than his body.

<blank>

Hi, I'm here to wholesale sake. I'm here to wholesale alcohol. ...... hmm?　Hey, it's crunchy. Long time no see.

Come on, Sati-tan!

<blank>

The little red-haired brown legal loli, or dwarf peddler, was Satitan, whom I had met in Solacidore.
