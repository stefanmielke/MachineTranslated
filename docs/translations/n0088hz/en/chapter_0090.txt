# Differences in Labor Nature

<b>

I, Karina-chan! I've come to deliver the honey from Solashidore!

<b>

When I supplied honey from Solashidore to a store introduced by the merchant guild in Calcutta, one large jar sold for 20 silver coins. Four jars for 80 silver coins.

Since it's included with the jar, the profit per jar is 9 silver coins. A total profit of 36 silver coins!

<b>

That sounds really merchant-like!

<b>

Well, I could also earn by delivering as an adventurer, but I really enjoy making money by moving goods like this.

How should I put it? Is it the difference in the nature of labor? Like, I'm actually earning?

<b>

<b>

You see, defeating monsters with spatial magic and delivering items is completely dependent on spatial magic, right?

Nothing starts without spatial magic. It feels more like spatial magic is using me.

<b>

On the other hand, trading goods like this is my own achievement. I don't need spatial magic for that.

Using spatial magic to make difficult tasks easier feels like I'm utilizing spatial magic.

<b>

<b>

In other words, it's like saying, "It's a bit much to flaunt the power of 'gifts'..."

Honestly, it's a trivial difference, and in the end, spatial magic is still amazing and convenient.

<b>

<b>

"Now, what would be good to buy here and sell elsewhere?"

"Hahaha, well, there's only what you can get from dungeons. Crawler meat sells decently elsewhere."

<b>

While I was unloading the honey, I gathered some information and got the response, "Well, that's true." In fact, Calcutta only has dungeons.

Conversely, it seems like any materials obtained from dungeons could be sold. As a merchant, it would be about buying those and selling them elsewhere.

<b>

<b>

...Hmm, it feels a bit off!

<b>

You see, monster materials are, to be honest, materials that can be easily obtained using spatial magic.

Going out of your way to buy them and sell them elsewhere feels like... charity? Unless it's for orphans or something. I'll leave that to someone else.

<b>

"Are there any processed products? Processed products."

"Then, maybe painkillers? It's a medicine made from monster poison, so you need a license for proper handling, but a couple of bottles for personal use should be fine."

<b>

Anesthetic, huh? If it’s not addictive, it might be okay to keep one.

I heard that you can make it by simmering the water used to detoxify crawler meat with medicinal herbs. Wow.

<b>

"Oh, there's also aphrodisiacs."

"Oh? Aphrodisiacs... Are those safe? They won't make you feel 3000 times more sensitive and lose your mind, right?"

"If it were that dangerous, it wouldn't sell. What do you mean 3000 times more sensitive?"

<b>

If it's not that, then it's fine... Wait, one bottle costs 20 silver coins? That's expensive.

Oh, but nobles might pay 50 silver coins for it. Huh. Even if I bring it to a merchant guild like Verald, it would still be around 30 silver coins.

<b>

...Would it be too expensive for a souvenir for Sister Harumikazuchi?

Hmm...

...No! I'll think about the details later!

I made a profit from the honey, so I'll buy two bottles and one will be a souvenir for my sister!

<b>

"I'll buy two bottles, so give me a discount. 30 silver coins."

"Hey, there's no way I can sell it that cheap; I'd be in the red. 38 silver coins."

"35 silver coins!"

"If you're buying something else, I can give it to you for 36 silver coins."

<b>

Oh, I see they’ve perfectly figured out my bargaining point. I thought it was a nice round number for my profit.

<b>

"Alright then. I'll buy some processed products that seem like they could sell elsewhere for 40 silver coins."

"Alright, that sounds good. My recommendation would be dried crawler meat; you can get a lot of it since it appears in the first layer of the dungeon. The smoked ones last for six months."

"Oh, that's the kind of processed product I was looking for."

<b>

So, with a budget of 80 silver coins,

<b>

Aphrodisiac 2 bottles: 36 silver coins

Mithril knife: 13 silver coins

Painkillers: 2 silver coins (for 2 bottles)

Dried crawler meat: 5 silver coins (20 coins × 6 sets)

Bowstring: 5 silver coins (equivalent to 5 pieces)

Silk spider cloth: 15 silver coins (equivalent to 2 shirts)

――――――――――――――――

Total: 76 silver coins

<b>

And the remaining balance is 4 silver coins.

It seems that both crawlers and silk spiders appear in this dungeon. I also heard that mithril can be mined here.

<b>

"Wow, that was a good deal. Come again; sweet things like honey are always welcome. There are bees in this dungeon too, but honey is rare. The demand is high since you can get it in small quantities."

"They also gave me a discount on the change and a set of dried meat. The merchant guild's introductions really don't miss."

"Of course. If you skimp a little and lose the introductions from the guild, it would be a loss. If you understand that, you'll make honest deals. ...Though, being a merchant, I might charge a bit more if you don't negotiate properly."

<b>

As long as there are goods to sell, it seems that having more merchants is better. Looking at the bigger picture rather than just immediate profits... Impressive, shopkeeper.

<b>

Just then, another merchant arrived.

A small figure, with a backpack that seemed larger than them.

<b>

"Hey there! I'm here to deliver some alcohol... Huh? Is that Karina? Long time no see!"

"Sa, Sati-chan!"

<b>

That small red-haired, brown-skinned legal loli, or rather, the dwarf merchant, was Sati-chan, whom I met in Solashidore.
