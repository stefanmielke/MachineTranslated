# Oh Lord Brave.

The "Aruji-sama, to put it succinctly and plainly, right after that, the drinking party suddenly started. ...... Well, it's just the usual Dwarvish thing to do."

<blank>

They say that when someone starts drinking and people gather there, the drinking party begins.

And it was a kitchen. There was food for snacks, a welcome guest (me) was there, and the food was already prepared, so there was no way it would not be a feast no matter what.

<blank>

So the old man gathered all the old dwarven women, including grandmothers, and asked them to give him the cute socks they were wearing and eat them, and here we are.

<blank>

Wow. I'm still too active when I'm sober.

I even seduced Sister Harumikazuchi.

<blank>

<blank>

By the way, we had all the grandmothers there, and none of the men approached us because they were so uncomfortable. That part was easy."

<blank>

Well, yeah. From my point of view, it's a loli harem, but from the dwarf's point of view, he's just about to have an old woman in attendance. I guess he didn't want to get too close. And moreover, it's her immediate family.

<blank>

You can't "ask out" in front of grandma, can you?　I mean.

It seems that even the quintessential Dwarves could not do it.

<blank>

<blank>

'And yet, did I collect all those grandmothers?'

"It seems like they were trying to avoid men, but also attract women who were on the fritz. I think that's what happened. ......

<blank>

Uh, yeah. If you're a grandmother, it's only natural that you'd be abducted at a banquet that also doubles as a blind date party (sic). The guys would go for the younger, prettier girls.

<blank>

<blank>

And Isiah's grandmother was peeking into the room. She looked so happy to see me. What's that?

<blank>

I said, "Oh, ...... Oh, you're awake. Kari. Good morning.

Oh. Good morning, Grandmother."

I'm so embarrassed to be so old!　Here, I'll give you this!"

<blank>

He lightly taps me on the shoulder with a crack of embarrassment of some kind.

What's with that maidenly reaction? It's cute. A ring?　Wow, what a beautiful angel relief. It's so nice.

<blank>

And more other dwarf girls heard it and came up to me when they saw that I was awake. Probably they were the ones I had made to stay with me yesterday.

Oh, is it water? Hi, I'm ...... I thought it might be alcohol, but it's water. Thank goodness.

<blank>

Kari, you should take this. My ex-husband told me that the human race has a hangover, right?　You're so cute. Oh, actually, this cup is handmade by me.

"Oh, it's not fair!　That's not fair, I'll make something for Kari, too!　I'm going to borrow your workshop!　I'll make something for you soon!　Oh, a knife, just a knife!

"Kari, let's play again, okay?　Come to our village, too. Oh, I'm always ready to play with you. And here is a pouch I made from the dragon stuff I got yesterday.

If Kari had a (peep), I would have given her a baby. I think I can have 10 more children with Kari-chan. I'm going to give her a hair ornament. It gives me confidence.

<blank>

Yikes, I'm totally irresistible, aren't I?　Hehehe.

Well, all these kids are apparently aunts and old people in the dwarf sense of the word.

What's more, four of them seem to be children from other villages who rushed to the feast for the dragon materials.

<blank>

Oh, you made me a knife?　So fast. And it fits my hand perfectly.

Thank you all. I'll take good care of them!　I love you!

<blank>

'By the way, God-willing, even grandmothers are welcome to shame socks, right?　I'm waiting for your delivery!　Hehehe!

<blank>

God, please don't talk to me all of a sudden, I was a little surprised.

And don't hee hee hee, you'll ruin a beautiful girl.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, the village head is approached as well.

<blank>

Oh, Lord Braveheart," he said, "you have put the old ladies in a very good mood. Thanks to you, the ladies are in a very good mood. That's my hero.

"Wait, what?　How did you go from guest to hero?　I don't remember pulling out the holy sword.

"Well, ......, to seduce all the grandmothers and make them all your housemaids is, in our view, nothing short of heroic.　If you think we're crazy enough to take all the Five Elders as local wives, then..."

<blank>

So that's what you mean by brave. I see.

Is ...... a local wife?

<blank>

I'm like, "Oh, wait a minute. Did I just get married?"

The "ladies begged for dragon materials, and after generously handing them over, they presented you with a handmade creation that they were proud of. The rings, cups, pouches, hair ornaments, and knives ...... would all be enough to build a mansion in the land of humans if bought as usual. The more I look at it, the worse it looks. What is this magic grant? The Five Elders are not bad ......."

What kind of things have you got on you?

<blank>

Ring: a ring of substitution. It takes the place of a one-time fatal wound.

Cup: a poison-dispelling cup. Even poisonous swamps are turned into fresh water. The disadvantage is that it also turns liquor into water.

Pouch: Large capacity pouch. Despite its appearance, it can hold about as much as a shed.

Hair ornament: A hair ornament that hides one's appearance. Temporarily makes it harder for enemies to find you.

Knife: Automatic demolition knife. It flies by itself and performs automatic stripping.

<blank>

...... and they all seem to be national treasures.

<blank>

Wow. It was a gift from a girl and I wasn't going to sell it, but it was a terrible idea.

And then, it was a Dwarven proposal to give him a confident gift, wasn't it? I forgot!

(Notice below.)

The book version, "The rest is up to you! ~God beat the last boss in the tutorial, so I'll live as I please~"

The, one-volume range of--

<blank>

It's up to "The First Town, Solacidore!"

<blank>

In other words, Dear, you've been working on ......2 since the volume!

If we don't sell one volume, Dear, you won't be able to get out, so buy one. ...... buy one!

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, so I'm gutting the Solacidore section and writing more.

I'm looking forward to seeing the illustrator, Dr. Ixy, on the cover!

And it looks like they will be doing a lot more. ...... Looking forward to it!
