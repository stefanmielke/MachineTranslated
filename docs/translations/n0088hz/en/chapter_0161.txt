# Oh, brave hero.

<b>

"To put it simply and clearly for you, right after that, a spontaneous drinking party started with much ado. ...Well, it's just another usual thing for dwarves."

<b>

It seems that once someone starts drinking and people gather, a drinking party begins.

Especially since it's the kitchen. There were snacks available, and the welcoming guest (me) was there, and with everything prepared, there was no way it wouldn't turn into a drinking party.

<b>

"So, you, my lord, gathered the older dwarf women, starting with grandma, and sweet-talked them into giving you their cute 'please take my socks' while you were at it, and this is the result."

<b>

Wow. Me with alcohol is still way too active.

Sister Harumikazuchi was sweet-talking too.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, since you were gathering the grandmas, the men felt awkward and no one approached. That was nice."

<b>

Well, yeah. From my perspective, it's a loli harem, but from the dwarves' viewpoint, it's a situation with old women surrounding me. They probably didn't want to get too close, especially since they are relatives.

<b>

Can you really make a 'proposal' in front of grandma? 

It seems even dwarves found that impossible.

<b>

<b>

"Still, did I really gather only grandmas like that?"

"It seems you were avoiding men and gathering the leftover women. So, I guess that's how it turned out..."

<b>

Ah, yeah. It's only natural that grandmas would be left out at a party that also serves as a matchmaking event (if you know what I mean). The men would definitely go for younger, cuter girls.

<b>

<b>

Then, Grandma Aishia peeked into the room. When she spotted me, her face lit up with joy. How cute.

<b>

"Ah... Oh, you're awake, Kari-chan. G-good morning!"

"Ah. Good morning, Grandma."

"......～～～Ugh, it's embarrassing at my age! Here, take this!"

<b>

She lightly tapped my shoulder a few times as a way to hide her embarrassment.

Huh, what's with that girlish reaction? So cute. A ring? Wow, it's a beautifully crafted angel relief. Lovely.

<b>

Then, other dwarf girls heard that and came over when they saw I was awake. They were probably the ones I had surrounded myself with yesterday.

Oh, is this water? Thanks... Yeah, I thought it might be alcohol, but it was definitely water. I'm glad.

<b>

"Kari-chan, drink this. My late husband used to say that humans get hangovers, right? How cute. Oh, actually, this cup is handmade by me, so if you like it, you can keep it."

"Ah! That's unfair, I want to make something for Kari-chan too! I'll borrow the workshop for a bit! Wait, I'll make something right away! Oh, a knife, a knife is fine!?"

"Kari, let's play again, okay? Come visit our village too. Ah, I'm always okay with that. Also, this is a pouch made from dragon materials I got yesterday, so treat it with care, thinking of me."

"Ugh, if I had been with Kari-chan, I would have had kids for you. I feel like I could have about ten kids with Kari-chan. I'll give you a hair accessory from my collection. It's my pride and joy."

<b>

Whoa, am I really super popular? Hehe.

Well, these girls are all considered aunties or elderly from a dwarf's perspective, though.

Moreover, four of them seem to have rushed to the drinking party for the dragon materials.

<b>

Oh, did you make the knife for me? That was fast. And it fits perfectly in my hand.

Thank you, everyone. I'll cherish them! Love you!

<b>

"By the way, even grandmas are welcome if they have shy socks, you know? I'm looking forward to your delivery! Hehe!"

<b>

God, please don't suddenly talk to me, it surprised me a bit.

And stop saying 'hehe,' it ruins the image of a beautiful girl.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Then, the village chief called out to me.

<b>

"Oh, brave hero. Thanks to you, the grandmas are in a fantastic mood. As expected of the brave hero."

"Wait? Why did I go from being a guest to a hero? I don't remember pulling out a holy sword."

"Well... sweet-talking all the grandmas and having them surround you is nothing short of heroic from our perspective, right? To make all five elders your local wives, are you out of your mind?"

<b>

So that's what they meant by hero. I see.

...Wait, local wives?

<b>

"Eh, wait a minute. Did I end up getting married or something?"

"You were asked by the grandmas for dragon materials and generously handed them over, and then you were gifted with handmade confidence-boosting items. That ring, cup, pouch, hair accessory, knife... If you bought them normally, they'd be enough to build a mansion in the human kingdom. Yeah, the more I look at it, the more insane it seems. What is this magical enhancement? The five elders are not to be taken lightly..."

"What, what kind of enhancements do they have!?"

<b>

Ring: Ring of Substitution. Takes a fatal blow once in place of the wearer.

Cup: Poison-Removing Cup. Turns even poisonous swamps into clean water. The downside is it turns alcohol into water.

Pouch: Large Capacity Pouch. Despite its appearance, it can hold the equivalent of a small hut.

Hair Accessory: Concealment Hair Accessory. Temporarily makes it hard for enemies to find the wearer.

Knife: Automatic Disassembly Knife. Flies on its own and automatically strips items.

<b>

...It seems all of them are national treasures.

<b>

Wow. They were gifts from girls, so I had no intention of selling them, but this is outrageous.

And giving handmade confidence-boosting items was a dwarf's way of proposing. I had forgotten about that!

----------------

(Notice below.)

<b>

The book version, "Feel free to do as you like! ~Since the god defeated the final boss in the tutorial, I will live freely~"

The range of volume 1 is――

<b>

"To the first town, Sorashidore"!!

<b>

So, Dear-kun will... be in volume 2 and beyond!

If volume 1 doesn't sell, Dear-kun won't be able to appear, so please buy it... please buy it!!

<b>

<b>

So, I'm thoroughly expanding the Sorashidore arc.

I'm looking forward to the cover by illustrator Ixy-sensei.

And it seems there will be various other things happening too... I'm excited!!
