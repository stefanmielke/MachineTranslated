# Wow, rich ●Illustrations

<blank>

So, Sati, you want to drink from the land of the elves, and you want to use your missing sister as a pretext? You wanted to use your missing sister as an excuse to drink alcohol from the land of the elves, is that right?

You're right, I'm sorry."

<blank>

Satitan apologizes profusely with her head on the floor to Dear-kun, who is sitting on a chair.

By the way, the silver coins I was paying at the Adventurer's Guild were for information about the stiffs and the alcohol. They knew I had witnessed it and tried to take advantage of it.

<blank>

What, you said you sent out a request for information, but you didn't say 'my sister's'?　Oh, you're right. I was totally fooled. Hmmm, too smart for my liking.

I am sure that if it weren't for Isiah, Mr. Dear would have been a regular mouthpiece.

<blank>

And most of all, I love the candor with which he admits and apologizes that it was a lie, without insisting that he was really looking for it. LOVE.

<blank>

<blank>

Dear Dia. My apologies as well. This child just wants to drink alcohol. He is a child who became a merchant just to drink alcohol. ......"

Oh, well, I apologize too. I'm the one who introduced them. I'm sorry, Dear."

I forgive you, in the face of ...... Isiah and your sister."

<blank>

Satitan is forgiven!　Thank God!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sorry about the crunch, too. I'll give you a sock, please forgive me."

'Ummm, I forgive you!　Oh, take it off here and now, no washing allowed. That's the condition of my forgiveness."

Uh-oh. Woo, I got it. ......"

<blank>

Sati-tan took off her boots in embarrassment. At that moment, I felt the humidity in the room rise a little and the salty smell spread. Wow, it's so thick.

<blank>

"Wow Sati, how long have you been wearing that?"

'Oh, it's none of your business, sister!

"Open the window, please, window. It smells so bad."

~~~!"

<blank>

Sati-tan gets teary-eyed at Isiah's verbal agitation.

Satitan then takes off all of her thick socks, glancing around to see the reactions of those around her.

After exposing her soft, reddish sole twice on each side, she tried to wash the socks she had taken off in her hands, remembered she had forbidden it, stopped, and handed them to me with her face so red that even her brown skin was recognizable.

A very lovely feast.

<blank>

I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry I did something to get in your face, Crunchy.

I forgive you!"

<blank>

I store the steaming damp hockey socks I receive via my cleavage.

......

I feel like I could eat a meal just from the smell on my fingers!

Gggg, my sexuality is in trouble!　Oh my god ......

<blank>

<blank>

After ......, it was only now that I realized that since I wasn't delivering the product to God, I probably didn't need to stir up any sense of shame.

In the meantime, I'll give Satitan a new pair of socks to replace the old ones.

<blank>

<blank>

"By the way, can't I just say I'm here for alcohol and enter the country?"

I can do that. That's why I couldn't allow him to try to take advantage of my sister being dead or alive."

<blank>

Oh, Dia, you're such a big sister, aren't you? I wonder how is Ms. Kumin doing?

He seemed fine when I wrote to him and asked permission to use the boys' clothes.

<blank>

Sati said, "Well, this was Sati's fault. I'll be careful next time.

'Yes Crunchy. ...... next time I'll use my aunt who is properly dead so she doesn't get caught."

That way they won't know. That's a good idea, Satyan!

No, it's not good!　You're not sorry at all!"

Ugh, the elves don't get the joke ......"

<blank>

Well, maybe it was the wrong time to unveil the joke.

<blank>

But I'm glad that Ai is alive and well. I didn't think she was in Solacidore. It is hard to see the feet of a big-breasted woman, isn't it?

<blank>

Is that a saying that means something like "it's darkest under the candlestick"?　When a dwarf, who is a lollipop, says it, it seems to have some connotations.

<blank>

I wasn't so much safe as I was okay," he said. I was missing both arms, and my face and throat were crushed.

What's that, a bard set? What do you mean?

<blank>

I explained to Sati what my original condition was, saying that Mr. Healer had cured me. He also said it was cheaper because of it.

<blank>

'Wow ...... that, I'm kind of sorry. I didn't know it had been like that for a few years. That's why you got angry. I'm really sorry, okay?"

It's all right. I heard that the alchemy kingdom was destroyed somehow, and my resentment must have gotten through to God."

"Ha-ha, it would be terrible if a country was destroyed by the power of one person, ai sister."

<blank>

I gently looked away, knowing God wasn't getting through to me. I'm sorry I hit you sideways, okay?

<blank>

But I see. I can't buy out Ai's sister then, can I? Continue to live a life of slavery. If Crunchy is the master, well, he won't do anything wrong, will he?"

Hmm?"　Well, we certainly can't let Isiah go, can we? Yeah."

<blank>

I was expecting them to negotiate a purchase of ownership or something in order to free Aisia, so I was a bit out of the loop.

Oh, I guess it's because it's more expensive with 5 more gold coins when you add on the cost of treatment. Considering how much alcohol I could drink with that much, it's certainly something I can't afford to buy.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, Isiah ended up lending it to Saty Tan that day.

I'm sure the sisters have stories to tell each other. Of course, I'll keep it a secret.

<blank>

It was a surprise to me that Saty and Isiah were sisters, wasn't it, Dear?

'Yes, I see. And this is the first time I've heard of a family of dwarves."

<blank>

Elves are basically monogamous, and the polygamy of dwarves seemed much harder to understand.

I think there is a lot of convenience in polygamy. I don't know if I can leave my own blood in the family, though.

<blank>

<blank>

Well.

<blank>

Aisia was to sleep in Satyan's room, but in front of me and Dia, there was one bed and two pillows. I had initially told the innkeeper that Dia and I would sleep in the bed and Isiah would sleep on the floor.

<blank>

So what are you going to do?　Do we stay in this bed together?　Do we put out a base of storage space?"

As long as we don't know when Mr. ...... Sati will be here, I think we should just go to bed for the rest of the day!"

I know." I thought so too. It's a little cramped for today, but bear with me, Dear."

<blank>

Well, tomorrow we will know Sati Tan's schedule and other things and we can use the storage space base.

So I slept with Deere in the bed with him.

<blank>

Of course I had Dear change into girl's clothes!
