# Wow, rich ●Illustration included

"So, Sati-san. You tried to use your missing sister as a decoy just because you wanted to drink the alcohol from the Elf Kingdom, is that right?"

"That's correct, I'm sorry."

<b>

Sati-chan deeply bows her head to apologize to Dia-kun, who is sitting in a chair.

By the way, the silver coins she paid at the Adventurers' Guild were apparently for information about alcohol. She tried to use me knowing that I had witnessed it.

<b>

Wait, you did put out a request for information, but you didn't say 'sister'? Oh, that's true. I was completely deceived. Hmm, she's too smart and I like her too much.

If it weren't for Aisia, Dia-kun would probably have helped me out normally.

<b>

And above all, I love her straightforwardness in easily admitting and apologizing with "It was a lie" without insisting that she was really searching. Love.

<b>

<b>

"Dia-sama. I apologize as well. This child just wants to drink alcohol. She became a merchant just to drink alcohol..."

"Oh, then I apologize too. I introduced her, after all. I'm sorry, Dia-kun."

"…I will forgive you, for the sake of Aisia and your sister."

<b>

Sati-chan has been forgiven! I'm glad!

<b>

"Ugh, I'm sorry too, Karikari. I'll give you some socks, so please forgive me."

"Hmm, I forgive you! Oh, take them off here, no washing allowed. That's the condition for forgiveness."

"Ah, okay. Ugh, I understand..."

<b>

Shyly, Sati-chan takes off her boots. At that moment, the humidity in the room seems to rise a bit, and I felt a salty smell spreading. Wow, rich.

<b>

"Wow, Sati, how long have you been wearing those?"

"Th-that's none of your business, big sister!?"

"Master, please open the window. It's unbearable."

"~~!"

<b>

Sati-chan's eyes well up with tears at Aisia's teasing words.

And Sati-chan, while glancing at the reactions around her, quickly takes off all of her rich socks.

After exposing her soft, slightly reddish soles twice, she tries to wash the socks in her hands but seems to remember that it was prohibited and stops, turning her face bright red enough to be noticeable even on her brown skin, and hands them to me.

So cute, thank you very much.

<b>

"I'm really sorry. I did something that would tarnish Karikari's reputation."

"Hmm, I forgive you!"

<b>

I stored the warm, damp socks received through my cleavage.

……

Just the smell on my fingers feels like I could eat a meal!

Gugugu, my fetish is dangerous! Damn you, God...

<b>

<b>

……Also, I realized a bit too late that there was no need to provoke her sense of shame since I wasn't delivering to God.

For now, I'll gift Sati-chan a new pair of socks.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, can't you just say you're here for alcohol and enter the country normally?"

"You can. That's why I couldn't forgive you for trying to use my sister's unknown fate."

<b>

Ah, Dia-kun is really a big sister's boy. I wonder how Kumin-san is doing.

He seemed fine when I got permission to use boy's clothes in a letter.

<b>

"Hmm, this was Sati-chan's fault. Let's be careful next time."

"That's right, Karikari. …Next time, I'll properly use a deceased aunt so it won't get found out."

"If that's the case, it won't be found out. Good idea, as expected of Sati-chan!"

"No, that's not good!? You're not reflecting at all!"

"Ugh, elves don't understand jokes..."

<b>

Well, it might have been a bad timing to tell a joke.

<b>

"But I'm really glad that Ai-nee is alive. I never expected her to be in Sorashidore. It's true that you can't see the feet of a big-breasted woman."

<b>

Is that a proverb meaning something like "it's dark under the lighthouse"? It feels like there's some implication when a loli-peitan dwarf says it.

<b>

"She wasn't exactly safe, though. After all, she was missing both arms and her face and throat were crushed."

"What? That's like a bard's set. Huh, what does that mean?"

<b>

I explained to Sati-chan that "the healer fixed her up," detailing what her original condition was like. Thanks to that, it was also cheap.

<b>

"Wow... I'm sorry about that. I didn't know she had been in that state for years. So that's why Dia-san got angry. I'm really sorry, okay?"

"It's fine. Apparently, the Alchemy Kingdom has also fallen, so my grudge must have reached God."

"Haha, if one person's power could destroy a country, that would be terrible for Ai-nee."

<b>

Knowing that it didn't reach God, I quietly looked away. Sorry for the side hit?

<b>

"But, I see. Then I can't buy Ai-nee. Keep up your slave life. If Karikari is your master, you probably won't be treated badly."

"Hmm? Well, I certainly can't free Aisia. Yeah."

<b>

I was a bit taken aback, thinking she would negotiate for the ownership rights to free Aisia.

Oh, maybe the medical expenses would add five gold coins, making it expensive. If I think about how much alcohol I could drink with that, it really is an amount I can't buy her with.

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, that day, Aisia was lent to Sati-chan.

There must be a lot of stories to catch up on between the sisters. Of course, I'll make sure to keep secrets.

<b>

"I was really surprised to learn that Sati-chan and Aisia were sisters, Dia-kun."

"Yes. It was my first time hearing about a dwarf family's story as well."

<b>

Elves generally have a monogamous system, and the dwarves' polygamous system seemed quite difficult to understand.

I think there are many conveniences to it, though, polygamy. It becomes unclear in terms of whether one can properly leave their bloodline.

<b>

<b>

Now then.

<b>

Aisia was going to sleep in Sati-chan's room, but in front of me and Dia-kun, there was one bed with two pillows. Initially, I had told the inn that "I would sleep in the bed with Dia-kun, and Aisia would sleep on the floor."

<b>

"So, what do we do? Should we just sleep together in this bed? Or should we bring out the storage space base?"

"…Since we don't know when Sati-san will come, I think we should sleep like this for today!"

"Right? I thought so too. Just bear with it for today, Dia-kun."

<b>

Well, by tomorrow, we should know Sati-chan's plans, and we can probably use the storage space base.

So, I cuddled up in bed with Dia-kun.

<b>

Of course, I had him change into girl’s clothes!!
