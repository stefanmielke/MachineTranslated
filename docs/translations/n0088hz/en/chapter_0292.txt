# Even the gem appraisers and surprised sommeliers were there.

"Well, even without that, do you think you can deceive me, a sock sommelier, with such fake socks? The only reason the Chaos God lost is that they didn’t prepare proper socks to wear!"

"Kyaaah, that's ticklish! Tickle me, Time God-chan!?"

<b>

Even the gem appraisers and surprised sommeliers were there. Seriously.

<b>

<b>

"…Thank you for your hard work, Lady Karina."

"Ah, yeah."

<b>

Then, I was spoken to by the maid homunculus.

<b>

"It's tough for both of us to get caught up in our bosses' antics, isn't it? Here, have a café au lait after work. I like it before it mixes, but I don't want it after it's completely mixed."

"Ah. Thanks. …Um, is it okay that your boss is being toyed with by our god?"

"It's fine. I recognize this as a play. My master is surprisingly weak against pressure."

<b>

Hmm, I can tell that just by watching the battle in front of me. The Chaos God’s strength to push away the god's hand is weak. And the reactions seem to indicate they aren’t entirely displeased. Occasionally, a high-pitched voice rises.

<b>

"In the end, it was just a couple's antics."

"Right?"

"Tch, what do these gods think the world is?!"

"A date spot? Or maybe a love hotel?"

<b>

What a blunt maid!?

<b>

"Ah. By the way, is it okay to say that the mastermind was indeed the real Chaos God?"

"That's right. In other words, I am innocent because I acted under the real instructions. My boss is taking full responsibility, so I should be exonerated."

"…So what was Kaoru in the end?"

"Just like you, a vessel of the god."

<b>

Ah, so Kaoru is still Kaoru, and just like during the tutorial, the real person is inside now.

<b>

"This is my territory! You think you can win against me in a mere sub-god mode just because you entered that vessel? You want to be toyed with, right? Yes, yes, I understand, Chaos God. Tonight, I’ll spoil you plenty. Ah, is it this year? About ten years? Is it going to be that long?"

"N-no! I can't get out of the vessel! R-Rena! Help me!?"

"There’s no way a subordinate can win against a god that their boss can't defeat. Ah, it's time, so I’ll be leaving now."

"Rena—!?"

"Ah. Karina-chan, you can go home today too. Now, let’s have plenty of fun together, Chaos God!"

<b>

And perhaps those words were the trigger, but the maid homunculus and I returned to the church of the Alchemy Kingdom.

<b>

Kaoru isn’t here. Yeah, somehow, I can’t shake the feeling that I ended up delivering Kaoru, who was called the 'Chaos God', to the god…

If that’s similar to my 'tutorial', then their consciousness is still there… so, once the god is satisfied, they should be released and come back. The maid said that what was done was by the real Chaos God, so Kaoru should be innocent.

<b>

When they come back, I’ll welcome them warmly. Let’s do that.

<b>

"Oh. Welcome back, nya. Huh? Why is the maid here and Kaoru isn’t, nya?"

<b>

Oh right, Misha was here.

<b>

"…Well, it’s a bit complicated."

"Ah. I’m harmless now, so no worries. Trust me."

"Oh, is that so? Then it’s all good, nya. Since the god sent you back, you must have been forgiven, so there’s no problem, nya."

<b>

Yeah, that’s true? But if I think about it, Kaoru still hasn’t been forgiven…?

No, no, this time it’s like, "How outrageous! Do more!" meaning they weren’t forgiven. Yeah. I’ll be looking forward to Kaoru’s return…!

<b>

"Now then, Karina-san. Actually, I’m a maid made by the Chaos God, and given the way my master is, it seems I’ll be free for a while. I’m bored, you know? Do you understand? I’m bored."

"Um… Ah. Do you want to come over? Is it Rena-chan?"

"I’m sorry if it seems like I’m urging you. I’ll intrude then."

<b>

It seemed like urging, but it was more like a direct request, right?

I swallowed those words and opened the door to what felt like a long time since I last visited the base.
