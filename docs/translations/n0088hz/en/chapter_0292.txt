# Some sommeliers would be surprised at jewelry appraisers.

<blank>

<blank>

Even without them, you think you can fool me, the sock sommelier, with those counterfeit socks?　The only reason why the God of Chaos lost is because he didn't prepare socks that were properly worn!

"Kyaaaahhhh, tickle me, tickle me, little space-time god!"

<blank>

Some sommeliers are amazing gem appraisers. Seriously.

<blank>

<blank>

"Thank you for your hard work at ......, Lady Karina."

Uh, yeah.

<blank>

He spoke to a maid homunculus.

<blank>

I'm sorry you're both caught up in your boss's milking game, and here's an after-work café au lait for you. I like it until it's mixed, I don't want it after it's completely mixed."

Ah. Hi there. ...... Um, your boss is at the mercy of our God, is that okay?"

I'm fine. I recognize that this is the way to play. My Lord is not as pushy as I thought."

<blank>

Hmmm, that is quite obvious if you look at the battle before you. The force with which the Chaos God pushes away God's hand is feeble. And his body reacts as if he is not satisfied. The occasional raised voice.

<blank>

"It was all just a lovers' tit-for-tat."

That's right."

Damn, what do these gods think the world is!"

'Isn't it a date spot?'　Or a love hotel."

<blank>

You're a real piece of work, maid!

<blank>

I'm not sure. By the way, are you sure that the mastermind behind all this was the real God of Chaos after all?"

'Yes, that's right. That means I am innocent, because I did what I did at the direction of a real person. Now my boss is taking full responsibility, and I will be exonerated."

What was ...... Kaoru all about in the end?"

I am a follower of God, just like you."

<blank>

Oh, I mean, Kaoru is Kaoru, and he is in the same state as I was during the tutorial, and now he is in the same state.

<blank>

This is my domain!　There's no way you seriously thought you could beat me in subgod mode just by entering such a yorishiki, right?　That means you want me to play with you, right?　Yes, yes, I know, God of Chaos. I'm going to give you a lot of love tonight. Oh, this year?　I'm going to be a decade or so.　You're going to go for it?

I can't get out of my dependence!　I can't get out of the yorin!　I can't get out!　Help me!

How can the subordinates win against a god that the boss can't win against? Oh, it's my regular time, so I'll be going home.

Lenarooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

Oh. You can go home today, too, Karina-chan. Now, let's have plenty of fun together, God of Chaos!"

<blank>

And perhaps those words were the trigger that brought me and my maid homunculus back to the church of the Alchemy Kingdom.

<blank>

There is no Kaoru there. Yeah, what the heck, I can't help but feel that I ended up delivering Kaoru, who was called the "God of Chaos", to God. ......

If that thing feels like my 'tutorial', it's still conscious, so ...... that, once the god is satisfied, it will be released and return. As the maid said, it was the real chaos god after all that was doing all that stuff, and Kaoru should be innocent.

<blank>

Let's give them a warm welcome when they return. Let's do that.

<blank>

Hey. Welcome back. Hey, why is the maid here but not Kaoru?　Why is there a maid and Kaoru is not here?

<blank>

Well, there you are, Misha.

<blank>

...... Well, well, things got a little complicated."

Oh. Don't worry, I'm harmless now. Trust me."

Oh, really?　Then that's good. If God sent you back, then you must have been forgiven, so there's no problem.

<blank>

Yeah, sure?　Huh, but then again, Kaoru was still not allowed ......?

No, no, no, this time it's that thing. How outrageous!　Do more!" I guess that's why they didn't allow it. Yeah. I'll be looking forward to your return, Kaoru. ......

<blank>

'Well, Karina-san. Actually, I'm the maid of honor for the God of Chaos, and with the way the Lord is looking at me like that, I'm going to be bored for a while. I'm not busy, am I? Do you understand?　I'm bored."

Let's see, ....... You want to come to our house?　Rena-chan, right?"

I'm sorry I seemed to have urged you on. I will be happy to interrupt you."

<blank>

I think I did, or rather, I was urging him to do so, wasn't I?

I swallowed my words and opened the door to the base, which felt like it had been a long time.
