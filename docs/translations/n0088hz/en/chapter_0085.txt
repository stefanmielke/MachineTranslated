# I really want to take a ride!!!

<b>

Now, the car is ready.

That said, it’s just a huge mini 4WD with no brakes or safety devices, just an engine turned on. It can move on its own, at least.

<b>

Yes. It can move on its own!

<b>

…Then I really want to take a ride!!!

<b>

<b>

So, I used the guild certificate and said, “I’m going to trade towards Karkassa,” and went outside the town, getting into the magical engine car 'Star-kun No. 2' from a distance.

(‘No. 1’ is that stone model mixer. And ‘No. 0’ (wooden) is in my room after some modifications.)

I plan to pass it off as something the kind healer uncle gave me!

<b>

“Alright, we’re off to Karkassa! Yay!”

“Yay!!”

<b>

The only one who responded enthusiastically was Aishia, while Dia-kun looked anxious.

<b>

“Is it really okay to ride this?”

“Well, even if there’s an accident, I have my magic, so it’s fine.”

“Please stop before it becomes an accident!?”

“I’ll cast a defensive spell on everyone.”

“Please stop before it becomes an accident!?”

<b>

Hahaha. Leave it to the big sister.

I set the goblin general’s magic stone in the power source! Switch on!

<b>

Vroom! The car took off with a force that felt like it would give me whiplash.

That was close; it would have been bad if I hadn’t cast invincibility on everyone.

<b>

“Eek, ahh, Master, it’s shaking a lot, ouch!”

“If you talk, you’ll bite your tongue! And without suspension, this shaking is terrible.”

“Um, big sister, there’s a curve ahead, can we turn?”

<b>

Hmm, that seems impossible. The steering wheel has no effect at all.

It’s going too fast, and even if I try to turn, it feels like it’s sliding. The wooden wheels have no grip and are no good. They might break from wear and tear.

<b>

“I’ll turn off the switch for now.”

“Y-yes.”

<b>

With a click, I turned off the switch, and after moving forward for a while due to inertia, the magical engine car 'Star-kun No. 2' finally stopped, bumping along the uneven ground on the grass.

<b>

“…Is the engine broken?”

“Let’s see… ah, a few pistons are cracked. The gears are also broken and chipped. Maybe the magic stone was too strong.”

<b>

Even though I just drove it, the engine was in shambles.

It suddenly reached top speed, so the load must have been incredible. If only it were made of metal. Hmm, and starting on a slope would definitely be impossible; how was the accelerator pedal supposed to adjust the speed?

<b>

That said, it moved.

Without using spatial magic, it ran with people on board. The magical engine car 'Star-kun No. 2' did.

Aishia leaned out of the vehicle to look back. The starting point was far behind.

<b>

“Oh, we’ve moved quite a bit, Master.”

“Yeah. This might actually work. What do you think, Dia-kun?”

“...There are countless points I want to improve. Thanks to the defensive magic, I didn’t feel the wind, but I think the wind was probably intense.”

“That’s right, we need a windscreen and a front glass. I’d also like suspension.”

“This seems like it will be quite rewarding.”

<b>

Dia-kun’s face, as he said that, looked like a boy who was excited and thrilled, despite everything.

……

<b>

“Wait! Dia-kun, act more like a girl!”

“W-what’s with that all of a sudden?”

“Dia-kun, haven’t you forgotten you’re dressed cutely as a girl? You could be a bit more bashful, you know?”

<b>

When I said that, Dia-kun scratched his cheek awkwardly.

<b>

“Even if you say that, I’ve gotten used to wearing girl’s clothes for a while now… It’s too late to be embarrassed in front of the two of you.”

“Grr!”

<b>

Getting used to it. That’s a serious situation.

Being in a state of acceptance is too bland for the sense of shame that the gods desire!

<b>

This is not good, not good at all!?

I need to find some approach to earn that sense of shame…!!

<b>

“! By the way, Dia-kun. When was the last time you took a bath?”

“Eh? Ah… now that you mention it, I haven’t taken one recently…”

<b>

Right. I’m aware that he hasn’t used the bath I made while being absorbed in creating magical tools!

I pulled Dia-kun close and brought my nose close to sniff him. Even if it’s just for show, I’ll sniff.

<b>

…He smells sweet, like flowers?

What, is that how elves are? Wow, even without taking a bath, he smells really good… but I steeled my heart and said.

<b>

“You smell a bit.”

“...!? R-really?”

<b>

Oh, when I pulled back to look again, Dia-kun’s face was bright red.

Yeah, it would be embarrassing if your first crush told you that you smelled bad!

Alright, one more push.

<b>

“Yeah. This… we need to wash thoroughly! How about we all take a bath together today, the three of us?”

“Understood, Master!”

“Eh!? I-I can bathe alone!”

<b>

Alright, alright! His ears are bright red!

I expected Dia-kun to be embarrassed and refuse. Hehe.

Well, even if he agreed, it wouldn’t be a big deal to take a bath together. I’ve seen the lower parts in my previous life.

<b>

“Hmm? Make sure to wash behind your ears, okay? I’ll prepare the soap too.”

“I’ll wash!”

<b>

…Ah, but if I make him embarrassed with such forceful methods, it would be troublesome if he gets used to it again. I need to think of something to prevent him from getting used to it…

If I resort to extreme measures for a temporary fix, it will only escalate. Ah, what should I do?

<b>

“Oh, then is it okay if I just bathe with Master?”

“...Huh?”

<b>

And so it turned into that, and I ended up washing Aishia all over.

Since she also became my practice partner for massages, I was satisfied.
