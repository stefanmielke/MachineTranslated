# I'd love to take a ride for a minute!

<blank>

Now, the car is ready.

It is, however, like a giant mini four-wheel drive with an engine, but without any brakes or safety devices. It can drive itself, at least for the time being.

<blank>

Yes. It can drive itself, in a manner of speaking!

<blank>

I'd love to get on ...... for a little ride!

<blank>

<blank>

So, using his guild certificate, he went out of town, saying, "I'm going to go peddling toward Carcassa," and got into the magic engine car "Star-kun No. 2" from a short distance away.

(No. 1 is that stone model mixer. (No. 1 is that stone model mixer, and No. 0 (wooden) rests in my room in a reworked state.)

In obtaining it, we will pass it off as having been given to us by a kindly healer uncle!

<blank>

Yes, so we're off to Carcassa!　Yes!

Yeah yeah yeah!"

<blank>

Aisia was the only one who replied flippantly, and Dia-kun looked anxious.

<blank>

Are you sure you're okay to ride?"

"Well, if we crash, I have my magic, so I'll be fine."

Stop it before it turns into an accident!"

I'll put a defensive spell on all of you at ......."

Stop it before it turns into an accident!"

<blank>

Ha ha ha. Leave it to onee-san.

Set the goblin general's magic stone at the power source!　Switch on!

<blank>

Bagyun!　and the car started to drive off with the force of a whiplash.

Oh, it would have been bad if I hadn't put them all in a state of invincibility.

<blank>

"Oh, oh, my God, it's shaking, oh no!"

I bite my tongue when I talk, and the shaking is terrible without suspension.

"Oh, lady, it's a turn. Can you turn this way?"

<blank>

Well, I don't think I can do that. The steering wheel doesn't work at all.

It feels like it's slipping when I bend it too fast. Wooden wheels are no good, they don't have grip. I mean, it looks like it's going to get scraped and broken.

<blank>

I'm going to turn it off.

Ha-hi."

<blank>

With a flick of the switch, the "Star-kun No. 2" finally came to a halt.

<blank>

"Is the content of the ...... engine broken?"

I've got a crack in a couple of pistons. The gears are cracked and chipped. Maybe the magic stone was a little too strong.

<blank>

I just ran it, but the engine area was a wreck.

The load must have been tremendous, as it suddenly reached top speed. If only they had been made of metal. I wonder how the accelerator pedal works to adjust the speed.

<blank>

Nevertheless, it moved.

It did not use spatial magic, but drove with people. The magic engine vehicle "Star-kun No. 2" was.

Aisia moves her body out of the car body and looks behind her. The starting point was far behind.

<blank>

"Oh, you've moved around a lot, Mister."

I'm sure you're right. This is a good idea. What do you think, Dear?"

"There are a lot of things I'd like to improve on at ....... I didn't feel the wind thanks to the defensive magic, but I think the wind was originally great."

Yes, I need a windshield, a windshield, a windshield. I also need a suspension.

This is going to be challenging in more ways than one."

<blank>

Dia's face, as he said this, had the look of a boy who is somehow excited and excited.

......

<blank>

No, wait!　Dear, be more of a girl!"

What? Suddenly?"

I'm sure you've forgotten that you're dressed up like a pretty little girl, Dear.　I think you should be more embarrassed."

<blank>

When I said this, Dia-kun scratched his cheek.

<blank>

I'm used to wearing girls' clothes all the time. ...... I don't see why I should be shy with the two of you now.

Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

<blank>

Habituation. It is a venerable situation.

The state of being open is too thin in terms of the shame that God requires!

<blank>

This is not good, this is not good!

Something like this ...... shame, an approach that earns shame ......!

<blank>

"!　By the way, Dear. When was the last time you took a bath?"

What?"　Ah ...... come to think of it, maybe I haven't been in lately ......"

<blank>

Yes. I have already figured out that I haven't used the bath I made that much because I've been so absorbed in creating magical tools and stuff!

I hold Dear-kun close to me and sniff him with my nose close to him. I don't care if I'm faking it, I'm going to sniff.

<blank>

...... What's that sweet flowery smell?

What, are elves like that?　Well, they smell soooo good without taking a bath ...... but I'm going to be a heartthrob and say it.

<blank>

It kind of stinks.

"......!　Is that right?"

<blank>

Oops, when I took my face away and looked at it again, Dia-kun's face was bright red.

Yeah, yeah, it would be embarrassing if your first love's sister smelled your body odor and said you stink!

Okay, one more push.

<blank>

I'll have to wash this one a little more thoroughly. This ...... needs to be washed a little more thoroughly, doesn't it?　Let's take a bath together today, the three of us!"

Yes, sir!

What?　Hi, I can get in by myself!"

<blank>

All right, all right!　I'm red up to my ears!

I'm assuming you'll be too shy to say no, Dear. Hmph.

Well, even if they agree with me, it's not like we have to take a bath together. I'm used to seeing the bottom stick in my previous life.

<blank>

"Hmmm?　You're going to wash behind your ears, okay?　And I'll get you some secateurs, too."

I'm washing.

<blank>

...... Ah, but we can't let them get used to it again, even if we embarrass them by these forceful means. We'll have to think of something to keep them from getting used to it. ......

When you take extreme measures for a temporary fix, it just keeps escalating. Ah, what's going on?

<blank>

Oh, so I'll just go in with you, then?"

"...... hmm?"

<blank>

Something like that happened, and I had to wash every inch of Isiah's body.

In addition, I was satisfied because I had a massage partner to practice with.
