# This is the house of that divine artifact, huh

<b>

There was a shared carriage going to the museum, so I hopped on.

The dwarf driver was drinking, but I wonder how drinking and driving works in another world... The horses pulling the carriage aren't drinking, so I guess it's okay?

Everyone on Earth, definitely don't try this, it's an instant license suspension!!

<b>

Well then, with that, we have arrived at the museum.

Ah, I'm feeling a bit dizzy. This is a light buzz. Yup, yup, light buzz, light buzz.

<b>

"Master, we've arrived."

"Oh, this is the house of that divine artifact..."

<b>

With white pillars and white walls, it had the appearance of the Parthenon. The handles on the open doors were positioned for dwarves, but the building itself felt quite grand even for humans.

<b>

"Wouldn't it be better for you to drink some water too, miss?"

"Eh, mouth-to-mouth!? No way! But if dear wants to, it's fine!"

"Huh!? N-no, let's skip that."

"Shall I do it instead?"

"Aishia is fine too! Come on!"

'How about me?!'

"No way, not with a dragon. Hahaha."

<b>

Ah, how delightful. I wonder why it's so enjoyable? I don't know, but it's delightful.

<b>

<b>

As soon as I stepped into the museum, I noticed a lot of dwarves gathered around. There were bearded ones and lolis all over the place. What's going on?

<b>

"Ah! Kari-chan!! You came!"

"Huh? Oh, isn't that Mi-chan? What are you doing here?"

<b>

There was my local wife, Mi-chan, with a hair accessory. She's the kind-hearted dwarf who gave me the hair accessory as a gift.

Mi-chan squeezed through the crowd and hugged me.

<b>

"This is the museum I created. Rather, it feels like Kari-chan came to my place?"

"Wow, really? That's impressive, good job!"

<b>

When I patted Mi-chan's head, I felt the surrounding crowd stir.

<b>

"Hey, you... that's disrespectful..."

"Huh? You bearded one, shut up! Get lost!"

"That's right, Juno. Be quiet. You have no authority to interrupt between me and Kari-chan."

"B-but!"

"Can't you see this hair accessory that Kari-chan is wearing?"

"T-that belongs to Lady Vermilion!? W-what in the world...!"

<b>

Oh my! Mi-chan looks cool and sharp!

The bearded guy is flustered! Aah, I just love this!

<b>

"Hehe, you're in a good mood, Kari-chan. Are you that happy to see me?"

"Hmm? I'm happy. Oh, by the way, is something going on?"

"Yes! That's exactly it! Our museum is in a big pinch!"

<b>

Oh. What’s this? For some reason, it seems like the lady is in trouble.

<b>

"Hehe, I'm not bragging, but I'm pretty amazing, you know? Just tell me anything, I’ll help!"

"As expected of Kari-chan! You're so reliable, I’m falling for you again! ...In contrast to these men here..."

<b>

Goodness, Mi-chan shrugs while looking at the crowd staring at us.

<b>

"Actually, a precious treasure of the dwarves here is being targeted. We received a warning from the phantom thief Hermes."

"Wow, a phantom thief? A phantom thief at a museum... that's classic!"

"Exactly! So, I want you to protect the treasure, Kari-chan! Is that okay?"

<b>

Mi-chan looks up at me with big eyes. Guh, her pleading is so cute.

And she's my local wife, you know? There's no way I can refuse!

<b>

"Leave it to me! I’ll protect that treasure with all my might!"

"Really! Yay, now I have a hundredfold strength! I love you, Kari-chan!"

<b>

Mi-chan, who I was hugging while crouching, tiptoes to give me a quick kiss on the cheek. Kyaa, leave it to me!

<b>

"Okay, but let's consult about the security of the 'Wave Castle Hammer' right away."

"…Oh?"

<b>

Ah. The buzz has worn off.

Those who have read this far probably know, but she was the first woman to undress Karina-chan! Truly fearsome, this vixen. Wonderful!
