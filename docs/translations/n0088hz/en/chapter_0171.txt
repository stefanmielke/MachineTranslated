# This is the House of the Divine.

<blank>

There was a horse-drawn carriage to the museum, so we took it.

The dwarfs in the Gyoja were drinking, but what about drinking and driving in a different world? ...... Are the horses pulling the horses okay because they are not drinking?

Everyone on earth should never imitate them, or you'll get a one-shot suspension!

<blank>

Well, here we are at the museum.

Oh, I'm slightly dizzy. I'm tipsy. I'm tipsy, tipsy, tipsy.

<blank>

"Here we are, Master."

'Ooooh. So this is that divine house. ......"

<blank>

With white columns and white walls, it looked like the Parthenon. The handles on the open doors were the size of dwarves, but the building itself was so magnificent that even a human being would have felt it was large.

<blank>

Shouldn't your sister drink some water, too?"

"What, mouth-to-mouth?　I don't want to do that!　But if you want to, Dia, that's fine!

What?　I knew it!

Shall I do it?

I don't care if it's Isiah!　CAMOON!"

What about yourself?

No, I ain't with dragons. Ha-ha-ha."

<blank>

Ah, joyful joyful. Why am I so happy?　I don't know, but it's fun.

<blank>

When I stepped into the museum, I saw a lot of dwarves gathered around. There are a lot of bearded men and lollies. What's going on?

<blank>

Oh!　Kari!　You came!"

Oh, it's not Mee. Ah, it's not you, Mee. Why are you here?

<blank>

One of my local wives was there, a hair ornament mee-chan. She was the kind-hearted dwarf girl who gave me the hair ornament.

Mee came to hug me as we made our way through the crowd.

<blank>

This is a museum that we built. It's more like Kari came to our house.

"Oh, I see. That's great.

<blank>

As I stroked Mee's head, I felt a rustle around me.

<blank>

"Oh, hey anta ...... disrespect ......"

"An?　Leave the mustache alone!　Shove it off!"

Yes, Juno. Shut up. You have no authority to come between me and Kali.

But, sir?

"Can't you see this hair ornament Kari is wearing?"

That's Vermillion's?　Ugh, what the heck is that ......!

<blank>

Oh, my!　You look so cool and crisp, Mee!

The bearded guy on the other end of the line was flabbergasted!　I love him so much!

<blank>

I'm in a good mood, aren't I, Kari? Are you so happy to see me?

Hmm?　I'm so happy. Oh, that's right. By the way, did something happen?"

"!　Yes, yes, that's it!　Our museum is in trouble!

<blank>

Oh. What is it? I don't know what it is, but your wife seems to be having a hard time.

<blank>

'Hmmm, I'm not proud of it, but I'm awesome in my own way, okay?　Tell me anything and I'll help you!"

I'm so in love with you, Kari-chan!　I'm so reliable, I'm falling in love with her all over again! ......By contrast, the men here are ......."

<blank>

Mee-chan looks at the crowd of people watching us and shrugs.

<blank>

The Dwarves' precious treasures here are being targeted. We received a warning letter from Hermes the Phantom Thief.

'Heh, a phantom thief?　That's a classic for a museum and a phantom thief ......!"

Yes!　So I want you to protect the treasure, Kari!　No?"

<blank>

Mee-chan looks up at me with her eyes looking up at me. Gwuh, Lolita's begging is so cute.

And this is my local wife.　How could I refuse?

<blank>

I'll take care of it!　I will protect that treasure!"

True!　Yay, I'm a hundred strong now!　I love you, Kali!"

<blank>

I was bending down to hold Mee-chan in my arms, and Mee-chan stretched out and gave me a big kiss on the cheek. Kyawawa, I'll take care of it!

<blank>

Let me ask you about the security of the Wave Wall Hammer.

"...... Oops?"

<blank>

Ah. I'm sobering up.

The official X (old Twitter) account, information about the Harumikazuchi sister was added.

As everyone who has read this far knows, she was the first woman to take off Karina's clothes!　It's called a fearless vixen, isn't it? Lovely!
