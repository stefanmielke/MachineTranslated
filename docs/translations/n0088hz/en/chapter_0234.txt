# It’s quite persuasive, isn’t it…!!

Due to a divine matter, I had Dia-kun go home first, and I brought Misha to the church.

<b>

“Hey, this isn’t a joke, is it, Karina? This is really a church, right?”

“I told you so. Come on in, Misha. Hello, I’m here for the delivery.”

“Welcome to the chapel!”

<b>

I was lightly guided by the bunny-eared Siesta into the chapel.

<b>

“...Huh? Huh? What should I do?”

“For now, just sit down and pray?”

<b>

As I offered a prayer with Misha, it was indeed the realm of the gods.

And there, a woman who seemed to be the model for the deity statue was waiting.

<b>

“—I have been waiting for you, Misha-san.”

“Nyah… G-g-g-goddess!?”

“Yes, I am the goddess.”

<b>

The woman smiled brightly. …Oh, the real goddess is secretly manipulating things from behind. This is a puppet. Is it ventriloquism? Impressive.

<b>

“Misha, there is a possibility that you are under a curse.”

“Eh!? Is that so!?”

“That’s why I called you here. Now, please entrust yourself to me.”

<b>

Obeying the goddess’s words, Misha placed her stomach on the thighs of the goddess (the puppet).

The real goddess quietly stood behind Misha.

<b>

“Now, I will perform a physical examination. I will touch you, so please relax.”

“Nyah, y-yes!”

<b>

She was tense and stiff. Well, it’s normal to feel that way when it comes to a goddess…

…And then, the real goddess, with her usual smirk, began to knead Misha’s backside.

<b>

“See, relax, relax.”

“Ah, nyah, nyahhh…”

<b>

Misha was quickly melted into a puddle of bliss. What a technician.

I quietly communicated with the real goddess using spatial magic.

<b>

“...Um, goddess? You didn’t really call Misha here just to knead her backside, did you?”

“Yes, I did.”

“What about the curse?”

“There is a possibility. The possibilities are always infinite.”

<b>

Is that a lie?! I knew it.

<b>

“...If I had to say, it’s because I wanted to know the secret behind the backside that attracts a sock-loving person like me?”

“Misha has a backside that truly pleases the goddess.”

“And I realized it by touching it directly. …This backside feels just like that of the Chaos God!! Beautiful! Marvelous! Excellent!!”

<b>

Seriously? Misha has the same backside as the Chaos God?

<b>

“Phew, I’m satisfied. I’ll give you a special 30 SP.”

“...Is that butt points?!”

“Indeed, it’s butt points!”

<b>

With a loud smack, the goddess hit Misha’s backside. “Pinyah!” Misha cried out.

Then she said, “If I hit you ten more times, the curse on Misha-san’s backside will disappear,” but the curse wouldn’t exist even without hitting ten times, right? It’s just that she wants to hit it.

Misha, too, is saying, “P-please do it, nyah!!”

<b>

“Ahhh… so easily deceived, super cute.”

“If you keep teasing her too much, she might say she’ll stop believing again, you know?”

“It’ll be fine. Because it’s Misha, after all.”

<b>

It’s quite persuasive, isn’t it…!!
