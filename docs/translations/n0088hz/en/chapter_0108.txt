# I may have taught you knowledge. ...... Well, okay!

Hi, I'm Karina!　I got permission to visit the blacksmith shop and I'm showing it to you as soon as possible!

They're sticking a stick with black fuel and metal ingots attached to it into a big stone furnace, burning it with a gurgle, and tapping the metal as it heats from red to white!

Hmmm, very blacksmith-like!

<blank>

Incidentally, this forge is now making iron knives, apparently. The one who is making them is Dwarf (15 years old), who came out first. I heard that he is helping his father to succeed him.

It seems that the quintessential master's work is not easily shown: ...... No, it seems that there simply isn't enough work for the master to do right now.

<blank>

But I can't believe you enjoy watching people blacksmith. There are some strange people among the human race.

It's fun, isn't it?　It's fun, isn't it? It's kind of mysterious or magical how materials are transformed into products, isn't it?

I know you know what I'm talking about, sister. Yes, a rolling stone can become a sword in blacksmithing, isn't it amazing!

<blank>

Mr. Dwarf in a good mood. We get along quite well.

The word "sis" does not mean "young lady" but literally "older sister". I am older than her. Outwardly.

<blank>

Yes," he said. I wonder, can you make musical instruments?　With a blacksmith."

Instruments?　That's a woodworker's job, isn't it? At most, some parts are made of metal. ...... But if it can be done by woodworkers, why not do it all with metal?　It might be a job for a craftsman.

In my hometown, there were brass instruments, and those were metal instruments. Flutes and stuff."

Oh. A metal whistle. Then I've heard of that!"

<blank>

Wow, there is. A metal flute. Well, like a trumpet or something.

<blank>

"My Lord, a flute is not suitable for a bard."

'Oh, did I mention that? So, a metal ...... percussion instrument?　Like an iron fiddle?　You put little planks of wood together and you tap them. The sound changes with the size of the planks, so you make a scale with them."

A sheet of metal?　You don't have to use a furnace to make a sheet of metal like that. Like this?"

<blank>

The dwarf sliced an ingot of iron with a hand knife.

What's that? Amazing. It's not quite a mirror finish, but it's a thin plate with a flat cross section. It's a bit like spatial magic, isn't it?

<blank>

Blacksmithing skills?"

Yeah. But only for ingots that I fabricated myself. When you get to be my father's age, you can make a bigger iron plate, but that's enough for you to hear about, right?　It's good practice.

<blank>

And then, as if slicing sashimi, Mr. Dwarf lays out the griddle on the floor.

Let's see, then, I'll use my woodworking skills. I cut a piece of wood that I had stored in storage, mortise it, and make the base of the iron harp like a bridge with thread for now. The steel plate is just for placing. The main body is good.

Then, a small wooden ball with a stick in it completes the bachi. When the bachi was tapped on the board, a clear "squeak" sound was heard.

<blank>

I was like, "Wow!　Wow, such an easy instrument!"

Oh, Aruji-sama, Aruji-sama!　May I try to play!"

Oh. "Oh, it's good. But you have to adjust the scale, I don't know.

You want me to change the size?　I got it."

"Oh, I think it would be better to drill a hole and thread a thread through it to hold it in place."

"A hole, hmmm, a small hole. ...... Yeah, I can do it!　Let's do it!"

<blank>

While enjoying the lively atmosphere, Aisia and Mr. Dwarf adjust the scale of the iron harp.

I'll leave it to you for a moment, as I just need to adjust the length of the steel plate as I cut it. Isiah's ear seems to be able to carve out the exact scale. No need for a tuner, right? ...... Wow, it's the same dolemifasolacido over here, isn't it? I wonder if this is imported as well as the public bath.

<blank>

<blank>

So, I went to Mr. Deere, who was half-neglected.

<blank>

I'm having a great time. I'm sorry I left you alone, Deere?"

No, no, no. I'm glad you're having a good time. I'm glad you're having fun, too.

<blank>

Dia-kun smiles with a smile. He's so cute. I want to suck his ears.

<blank>

I didn't realize you could make musical instruments.

It doesn't matter as long as you can hit the board," he said. If you hit it, you can usually make a sound. The hard part is fine-tuning.

<blank>

It would take a lot more ingenuity to make the sound resonate, though, and it is at the level of a toy. Well, this is a good enough instrument.

<blank>

I see. I wonder, ...... sister, if you combined it with a good spinning grimoire, could you get the grimoire to play?"

I'm going to make a music box. Are you going to make a music box?　Good one, Dear. I love that kind of thing. I'll tell you everything I know about music boxes.

<blank>

Deere, I'll tell you about the music box, since you seem to have gotten an interesting spark, too.

Paper music boxes are nice, aren't they? How do you do that thing, hook it in a hole?　I wonder if the paper doesn't tear. I wonder.

<blank>

Well, there's also something called a punch card that behaves in a pre-determined way depending on the ...... hole."

Oh, that sounds interesting: ...... Tell me more about it, sister!"

<blank>

Oh, no. I may have taught Dia some unnecessary knowledge. ...... Oh well!　It looks like fun!
