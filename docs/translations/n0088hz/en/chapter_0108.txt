# I might have taught him something... Well, whatever!

<b>

I'm Karina! I got permission to tour the forge, and I'm already being shown around!

They're shoving a stick with black fuel and metal ingots into a large stone furnace, burning it fiercely, and hammering the heated metal from red to white!

Hmm, it really feels like a forge!

<b>

By the way, it seems they're currently making a steel knife. The one making it is the dwarf boy who appeared first (15 years old). He’s helping out to follow in his father's footsteps.

It seems the master doesn't easily show off his work... No, it might just be that there isn't enough work for the master to do right now.

<b>

"Still, it's fun to watch the forge. There are some strange ones among the human race."

"Yeah, it's fun, right? Watching things being made. It's kind of mysterious or magical how materials turn into products."

"Oh, you get it, don't you, sister? That's right, in forging, a rock can turn into a sword, isn't that amazing!"

<b>

The dwarf boy is in high spirits. We really get along well.

Also, this "sister" doesn't mean young lady but literally an older sister. I'm older than him, appearance-wise.

<b>

"By the way, can you make instruments with forging?"

"Instruments? That's probably more of a woodworking job. At most, you might make some parts out of metal... Oh, but if you can do it with woodworking, could you do everything in metal? It might become a craftsman's job, though."

"In my hometown, there are brass instruments, which are metal instruments. Like flutes."

"Oh, a metal flute. I've heard of that!"

<b>

Oh, they exist. Metal flutes. Well, like trumpets or something.

<b>

"Master, flutes aren't suitable for bards."

"Now that you mention it, I think I heard that before. Then, how about metal... percussion instruments? Like a xylophone? You line up small boards and hit them. The size of the boards changes the sound, so you can create a scale with that."

"Metal boards? I could probably make that quickly without using a furnace. Like this?"

<b>

Then, the dwarf boy swiftly sliced a metal ingot with his hand.

What is that? Amazing. It's not a mirror finish, but it has become a flat, thin plate. It looks a bit like space magic.

<b>

"Is that a forging skill?"

"Yeah. But it's limited to ingots I've made myself. When you get to my dad's level, he can make bigger iron plates, but for what I've heard, this should be enough, right? It's just the right practice."

<b>

Like slicing sashimi, the dwarf boy lined up the iron plates on the floor.

Um, then I'll use my woodworking skill. I cut the wood stored away, make some joints, and for now, create a base for the xylophone with string. The iron plates are just placed on top. The main body is good as it is.

Then, if I stab a stick into a small wooden ball, the mallet is also complete. When I hit the randomly placed boards with the mallet, a clear "keen" sound rang out.

<b>

"Wow! Amazing, it can become an instrument so easily!"

"Oh, Master, Master! Can I try playing it!?"

"Oh. Sure, but we need to adjust the scale; I don't really know how, though."

"I just need to change the size, right? Leave it to me."

"Oh, if possible, it would be better to make holes for the strings to secure it."

"Holes, huh, hmm, for small holes... Yeah, I can do it! I'll make it!"

<b>

As they excitedly worked together, Aisia and the dwarf boy adjusted the xylophone's scale.

Since they only needed to adjust the lengths of the iron plates, I’ll leave it to them for a bit. Aisia's ears seem to accurately distinguish the correct pitches. No tuner needed. ...Oh, so this world also has do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do. I wonder if it was imported like the public bath.

<b>

<b>

Then, I headed over to Dia, who had been somewhat neglected.

<b>

"Phew, things are getting pretty lively. Sorry for leaving you, Dia."

"No, no. I'm just glad to see you having fun, big sister."

<b>

Dia smiled gently. So cute. I want to nibble on his ears.

<b>

"You can make instruments too, big sister."

"Honestly, as long as you can hit a board, it doesn't matter what it is. If you hit it, it generally makes a sound. The tricky part is the fine-tuning."

<b>

Creating resonances requires more various adjustments, and it's just toy-level, but this is still a sufficient instrument.

<b>

"I see... If you combine it well with a rotating magical tool, couldn't you make it play by itself?"

"Oh? Are you thinking of making a music box? Good job, Dia. I love that kind of thing. I'll teach you all about music boxes that I know."

<b>

Dia seems to have gotten an interesting idea, so I started teaching him about music boxes.

Paper music boxes are nice, right? How do they work again? Do they hook onto holes? I wonder if the paper tears. It's a mystery.

<b>

"By the way, there's also something called punch cards... They perform predetermined actions based on the holes."

"Oh, that sounds interesting... Please tell me more, big sister!"

<b>

Oh no. I might have taught Dia unnecessary knowledge... Well, whatever! It looks fun!
