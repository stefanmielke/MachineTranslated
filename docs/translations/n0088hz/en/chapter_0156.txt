# What do you think, Dad, you know things?

<blank>

As we proceeded through the cave, we found a very large open area.

It is like a dome with an open ceiling and the sky above.

The buildings were stone, gray, and square. There are also fields.

<blank>

This village seems to have been carved out of the top of a rocky mountain and built on the bottom of a cup-like structure.

<blank>

How do you get drinking water in a place like this?　Rainwater?"

What?　It's magic, but..."

<blank>

Magic is useful.

<blank>

<blank>

We were then led to the house of the village head, which was one of the larger buildings in the row of buildings - or rather, the room of the head of the village.

The entire village is a house, and each building is a "room.

<blank>

When we greeted him while handing him a bottle of sake as a souvenir, Mr. Rahman, the village head who is the father of Aisia and Satitan (the village head is the father, not by blood, and the others are roughly treated as brothers and sisters if they are close in age), welcomed us with open arms.

<blank>

"Welcome, my guest. Let us welcome you!"

<blank>

He is a muscular dwarf with a magnificent red beard.

In his hand was a bottle of sake with the lid already open. I just gave it to him, but he is already drinking it.

Or rather, "You're thirsty after saying hello," and I'm hooking them up with a bite.

<blank>

Dad, you're too excited."

You say, "I know what you mean, Pastel. I mean, Pastel, you gave up on Isiah when you thought she was already dead, didn't you?　I didn't expect her to come back home with a bottle of sake and all those beautiful ladies.

<blank>

Pastel, Satitan's younger sister - like Satitan, this one was a pure Dwarf with brownish-red hair. The only difference between them was in their facial features, and there was almost no difference in their physiques.

<blank>

And you just said alcohol. You're letting your true feelings out.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, so my room is gone then?"

'I put it away the day after you left the village in the first place. Now Ghana is using it with her daughter."

I was like, "Oh, Ghana, you're having a baby! My ...... sister beat me to it!"

<blank>

Oh, there have been a lot of changes in family relations at my parents' house that I hadn't heard from.

Surely if your sister or brother had a baby before you, you would have a lot of mixed feelings about it. I can only imagine.

<blank>

I'm glad to see you're doing well, Isiah, even though you seem to have fallen into slavery."

I'm not going to leave the protection of Aruji-sama at all. I'm not going to leave Aruji-sama's protection at all. I'd rather die if I give you any unnecessary attention.

"How could I do that to the gentleman who follows the ...... dragon? Your ideas are as scary as ever, who do you think you are like?"

<blank>

I've never seen Isiah like this before. It's fresh.

What?　What is it, Deere? ...... Oh, you mean assassinate me, as in, "extra care"?　Thank you for the addition. Wow, Isiah, you've been so lively since you came to this village.

<blank>

<blank>

But that's it. If you brought them to the dwarves' village, does that mean the three of us are going to join in the feast?"

What shall we do, Aruji-sama? What shall we do, Aruji-sama?　Do you want to join us?"

A "spree?　A celebration of Isiah's return?　If so, I might as well join in.

Oh, no. To put it plainly for people outside the village - uh, like an annual blind date party, right?　The kind that involves physical relations."

Oh, I'm good.

<blank>

I was almost baptized into the Dwarves' unrestrained culture earlier in the day.

I glanced at Mr. Dear and saw his face blushing.

<blank>

Don't worry, Dear, I'll protect you!　I made a promise to Mr. Masirow too!

<blank>

I guess so. I don't care if it's a man who just needs to sow his seed, but it's a woman. Besides, it is doubtful that the elf over there can conceive yet. If she were a dwarf of this stature, she'd be a fine woman, but from an elf's point of view, she'd still be a child. How about ......, Dad, you know things, don't you?"

'Ah, Father. Master Dear is a man, in case you were wondering."

What!　...... What?　I'm a woman no matter how I look. Why are you dressed as a woman?　Is it elven culture?"

I'm ...... deep in it."

<blank>

Incidentally, he said, "I won't let a kid with no beard participate, even if he's a guy in quicksand.

Good for you, Dear, your chastity is protected!
