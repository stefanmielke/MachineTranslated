# How about it, Dad? You're knowledgeable, right?

<b>

As we progressed through the cave, there was a very large open area.

It was like a dome with an open ceiling, and the sky was visible above.

Gray stone square buildings were lined up. There were also fields.

<b>

It seems this village was made by hollowing out the peak of a rocky mountain, creating a bottom that resembles a cup.

<b>

"How do you get drinking water in a place like this? Rainwater?"

"Huh? It's magic."

<b>

Magic is convenient.

<b>

<b>

Now, we were guided to the village chief's house, which was a bit larger than the other lined buildings—rather, it seemed to be the chief's room.

The whole village gives the impression of being one house, with each building being a 'room.'

<b>

As I greeted him while handing over the sake as a gift, the village chief, Mr. Rahman, who is the father of Aishia and Sati (though he is the chief, he treats others of similar age as siblings), welcomed us with open arms.

<b>

"Welcome, esteemed guests! Let me welcome you!"

<b>

He was a splendid dwarf with a red beard and a muscular build.

In his hand was already an opened sake bottle. He was drinking it even though I had just handed it over.

In fact, it seemed he took a quick sip saying, "I got thirsty after the greeting."

<b>

"Dad, you're too excited."

"Well, you say that, Pastel. To begin with, didn't you think Aishia was already dead? I never expected her to return home with such beautiful young ladies."

<b>

Pastel, Sati's younger sister—who, like Sati, was a pure dwarf with brown skin and red hair. There was almost no difference in physique, just a slight difference in facial features—rebuked the chief.

<b>

Also, he just mentioned sake. His true feelings are leaking out.

<b>

<b>

"Wait, does that mean I no longer have a room here?"

"I cleaned it up the day after you left the village. Now it's being used by Ghana and his daughter."

"What? Ghana had a child!? ...My younger sister got ahead of me...!"

<b>

Oh, it seems there have been various changes in family relations at the home I hadn't contacted.

Indeed, if a younger sister or brother has a child before you, it can lead to quite complex feelings. I can only imagine.

<b>

"It seems you fell into slavery, but I'm relieved to see you're doing well, Aishia."

"Yeah. Oh, just so you know, I have no intention of leaving my master's protection. If I were to worry about unnecessary things, I think I would actually die."

"…There's no way I'd do something like that to someone who commands a dragon. Your way of thinking is still frightening; who did you take after?"

<b>

This is the first time I've seen Aishia like this. It's refreshing.

Huh? What is it, Dia-kun? ...Ah, when you said unnecessary worries, did you mean assassinating me? Thanks for the clarification. Wow, Aishia has really come alive since coming to this village.

<b>

<b>

"However, that means that bringing you to the dwarf village means the three of us will participate in a drinking party, right?"

"Uh, um... What should we do, Master? Should we participate?"

"A drinking party? A celebration for Aishia's survival? Then I guess we should participate since it's a rare occasion."

"Oh, no. To put it simply for those outside the village—uh, it's like an annual matchmaking party? It involves physical relationships, though."

"Oh, never mind then."

<b>

I was about to be baptized in the free-spirited culture of the dwarves.

When I glanced at Dia-kun, he was blushing.

<b>

It's okay, Dia-kun, I'll protect you! I promised Mashiro-san too!

<b>

"Well, if it's just about planting seeds, that's fine for men, but for women, it's different. Besides, that elf over there is still questionable if she can conceive. With her height, she might be a fine woman for a dwarf, but for an elf, she should still be a child. ...How about it, Dad? You're knowledgeable, right?"

"Ah, Dad. Dia-sama is technically a boy."

"What!? ...Huh? She looks like a girl to me. Why is she dressed like a girl? Is it an elf culture thing?"

"…There are deep reasons behind it."

<b>

By the way, it was mentioned that "even if it's a boy, we won't let a child without a beard participate."

Good for you, Dia-kun, your chastity is protected!
