# "Huh?"

<b>

<b>

While having Misha help stir the pot, I ask Blade-senpai about the New Alchemy Kingdom.

<b>

"So, what does the New Alchemy Kingdom mean?"

"It means we're trying to rebuild the Alchemy Kingdom. It's mainly the original upper management of the Alchemy Kingdom leading the charge."

<b>

Oh, so it's the original upper management. That makes it seem like a proper reconstruction.

<b>

"And we were hired to help with that. Like I said earlier, the pay is pretty good, you know?"

"That's a bit strange, though. Wouldn't it be better to buy something useful for the reconstruction rather than just throwing money at C-rank adventurers?"

"Haha, that's the opposite, Retsufuu. If you treat C-rank adventurers like us well, others will come flocking too, right? After all, there's a story that the gods got angry and caused a ruckus, so we need to do something like that to gather manpower."

<b>

Wow. There's a Chinese saying, "Start with the humble," which means that by treating an ordinary person well, more talented individuals will think, "If they're treated well, I should be treated even better!" 

Isn't that exactly that strategy? Well played, New Alchemy Kingdom!

<b>

"Seriously? If it's a place where the gods got angry, then that makes sense. I mean, that's really smart!! Who came up with that idea?!"

"Apparently, it was the new king who thought of this."

"Oh, the king, huh? That might mean a bright future for this country."

<b>

I wonder what kind of king he is.

<b>

"Ah. The king of the New Alchemy Kingdom calls himself the True Chaos God."

"Huh?"

<b>

...Ah. Hmm. Yeah.

I take back what I said. The future of this country might be dark!!

<b>

"Huh? What's wrong, Karina? Suddenly holding your head."

"Ah, no, um... Senpai, we need to escape this country right now!"

"Huh? What are you talking about all of a sudden? I'm at work here."

"Just run! Nothing is worth your life. Okay!?"

"...Wait, is it really that bad?"

<b>

I nod repeatedly.

I mean, the god's "Huh?" came even faster than my reaction just now!!

<b>

"Karina-chan"

<b>

Oh no. I can almost hear the sound effect of the god getting angry.

And time seems to have stopped.

<b>

"…"

"This is a quest from the god. Capture that True Chaos God and bring him in using spatial magic. The deadline is three days. If you succeed, you'll receive 10,000 SP."

"…Okay."

<b>

By the way, didn't you consult the god at the church!? Why are you talking about the True Chaos God!? The god is furious and ready to erupt fantastically!?

<b>

"…By the way, what happens if we fail…?"

"A new hero will be summoned. Please be friendly with them as a senior, okay? After that country falls again."

<b>

It seems that the god has no intention of forgiving any Chaos God other than a lover, even if they have titles like True or Neo.

Please take a little inspiration from the open-mindedness of the Five Elders, God…!
