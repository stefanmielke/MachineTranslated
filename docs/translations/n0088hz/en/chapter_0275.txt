# "What?"

<blank>

<blank>

I ask Braid-senpai about the new alchemy kingdom while letting Misha help me stir the pot around and around.

<blank>

So, what do you mean by the new alchemy kingdom?"

It's like, "Hey, let's rebuild the alchemy kingdom," he said. In a manner of speaking, the upper echelons of the original alchemy kingdom are the main players."

<blank>

Hoh, the original upper management. I guess that makes it sound like a decent recovery.

<blank>

And we're kind of hired to help them out. Like I said, they pay pretty good, you know?"

I wonder why they don't just give the money away to C-rank adventurers and buy something to use for reconstruction?"

Ha ha, it's the other way around, Rikaze. If you treat C-rank adventurers like us well, you'll attract other people, won't you?　After all, it is said that God was angry and went on a rampage, and if you don't do something like that, you won't get the manpower.

What a surprise. There is a Chinese legend that says, "First things first. By treating the mediocre first mover well, more talented people will come to him and say, "Then I will be treated better! Then, more excellent people will come to him.

Isn't that exactly the strategy?　You've done it, newborn alchemy kingdom!

<blank>

I'm sure that's true if it's a place where God is angry with you. It's so smart!　Who the hell thought of that?

I hear it was the new king who came up with this idea."

"Wow, a king. Well, the future of this country might be bright.

<blank>

What kind of king is this?

<blank>

Oh. He's the king of the new alchemical kingdom, so he calls himself the True God of Chaos."

What about?"

<blank>

...... Ah. Hmm. Mm.

I take back what I said before. The future of this country may be bleak!

<blank>

What's wrong?　What's the matter, Karina, you suddenly got a headache?"

'Uh, no, I mean. ...... senpai, let's get out of this country right now!"

What?　I'm at work, okay? I'm at work, okay?"

Let's just run away!　He said it's not worth our lives. Right?

......Eh, it's that bad?"

<blank>

I nodded my head.

I mean, God's "What? I had a "Huh?

<blank>

Karina-chan."

<blank>

Yikes. 

And time stands still.

<blank>

"......"

'This is a quest from God. Kill this true god of chaos or whatever he is, or rather, kidnap him with spatial magic and hand him over to me. The deadline is three days. If you succeed, I will raise 10,000 SP.

"...... hi"

<blank>

I mean, didn't you ask God in church!　Why are you talking about the true God of Chaos!　God is having a fantastic eruption!

<blank>

"......, by the way, if I fail ......?"

'A new brave will be summoned. Please befriend them as your seniors, okay?　After that country is destroyed again.'

<blank>

From God's point of view, he is not willing to allow any chaos god other than his lover, even if he has a true or neo god.

Please take a moment to learn a little bit about the breadth of mind of the Five Great Elders, God. ......
