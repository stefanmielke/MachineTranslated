# How's it going!

<b>

Having easily won the first match, I proceeded to throw, push out, and beat down several more opponents.

<b>

"Ugh, my body won't move...!?"

"I've struck your vital points. You can only speak until I permit you to."

"I-I give up...!"

<b>

At times, I stopped moving like a master of a secret killing technique.

<b>

"Feel the power of my martial arts! Hiyah!! Yah!! Ha!!"

"If it doesn't hit, it doesn't matter...!"

"Whoa...!? When did I end up at the edge of the ring...!? That's a ring-out loss!!"

<b>

At times, I elegantly dodged like a red comet.

<b>

"I'll turn you into rust for this sword! Here I come!!"

"You're cheeky for a little dog! Doga! Merikomi Punch!!"

"How cruelーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー！！"

<b>

At times, I punched my opponent's face without a second thought like a bully.

(For reference, the opponent was a long-bodied dog beastman resembling a dachshund.)

<b>

Thanks to showcasing such a varied fighting style, even though I continued to win in an instant, the cheers grew louder with each victory.

Mainly, Aishia took the lead, cheering with a clear and beautiful voice, "Kyaa! My lord, ahem. Karina is so cool! The strongestーー!"

<b>

"Ha ha ha! How's that!"

<b>

When I raised both hands, the cheers echoed throughout the coliseum. ...Oh, wait, maybe that was just because the outcome of the match in the adjacent ring was decided? Hehe, my mistake.

<b>

By the way, I've already taken down ten opponents in a row. Wasn't this supposed to be a tournament? A round-robin? Or maybe a dog soba? Well, whatever works.

Since they keep coming one after another, it feels almost like an assembly line.

<b>

I heard that the fight money increases with the number of victories, so my rank will probably rise to C! Gahaha!

<b>

<b>

...Should I start to struggle a bit to make it look good? While thinking that, I knocked down my opponent with a lariat.

<b>

"Another instant winーーー! What on earth is this ladyーーー!? The Adventurers Guild has sent an incredible assassinーーー!"

<b>

The referee, or rather just a regular MC, was getting really into it.

Just then, after I knocked down the eleventh opponent, a beastman dressed like staff came up to the stage.

<b>

"Hey there—"

"Wait, wait! No, I'm staff!"

"Oops."

<b>

So it was a real staff member.

I stopped my attack. It wouldn't have been a problem if it were a lie, but since the referee also stopped, it must be genuine.

<b>

"Uh, um, how about taking a break soon?"

"Hm? Are you suggesting I lose on purpose to end it?"

"Oh, no! Not at all! Due to tournament proceedings, it's time to head to the waiting room!"

<b>

What the heck, if that's the case, you should have said so from the start.

<b>

"Oh, I see. So this was the preliminary round, and from now on, it's the main event?"

"Yes! Yes! Exactly right!"

<b>

I see, I see. It seems I had to defeat eleven opponents to qualify for the main event.

Well, considering I almost jumped in, it's understandable for a tournament with over a hundred participants.

A dungeon streamer who wants to become a lady until she becomes a real lady

It's a dungeon streaming story with aspirations of becoming a lady!

What's different from regular dungeon streaming stories is... the dungeon is in a game format,

probably without any invincible moves, and instead of lives, it involves savings,

and it's also a Vtuber story...!)
