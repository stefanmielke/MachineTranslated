# What's it like!

<blank>

I won the first game easily, and I buzzed, pushed, and beat up a few more guys.

<blank>

"Gah, my body can't move, hey ......?

I've hit a secret hole. You can only speak until I give you permission."

Oh, my God, ......!"

<blank>

At times, he stops moving as if he were a master of the killer fist handed down from one generation to the next.

<blank>

I'll show you my fist!　Hi-yah!　Yah!　Ha!

It doesn't matter if you don't hit it: ......!"

Noooo ......?　When did he get to the edge of the ring ......?　You lost outside the ring!

<blank>

Sometimes, it avoids them as gloriously as a red comet.

<blank>

He will make this sword rust!　Here I come!

You're a little cocky, you know that?　Dogaa!　Merikomi Punch!

Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

Sometimes, like a kid general, he would plunge his fist into his face without thinking.

(And the other party was a long-bodied canine beast like a dachshund.)

<blank>

Perhaps it was thanks to such a varied fighting style that the cheers became louder and louder with each victory, although they continued to kill in the blink of an eye.

Mainly centered on Aisia, "Kyaa!　Aruji-sama, geez. Karina is so cool!　She's the best! and cheered her up with a good, clear, bard-like voice.

<blank>

Hahaha!　What's it like!"

<blank>

I thrust my hands in the air, and that was all it took for the cheers to echo through the Coliseum. ...... Oh, no, was that because the winner of the next ring had just been decided?　Teheh. Wrong.

<blank>

I mean, I've already buzzed 10 people in a row. Oh, I thought this was a tournament?　A round-robin tournament?　Or wanko soba?　Well, I don't care which one it is.

They are sent in one after another, so it's like a workflow.

<blank>

I remember I was told that the fight money would be increased by the number of victories, so my rank will go up to C!　Gahaha!

<blank>

<blank>

...... I think it's time to show him a hard time, don't you?　What a thought, but I'll just knock down my opponent with a lariat for now.

<blank>

Another blink-and-you'll-miss-it!　What in the world is this young lady?　The Adventurers' Guild has sent in an unbelievable assassin!

<blank>

The referee, or rather the MC, who is no longer a freebie, is getting into the groove.

And just as the eleventh person was beaten to a pulp, a beastie dressed like a staff member came on stage this time.

<blank>

Oh, no.

Wow!　Wait, wait!　No, sir, I'm a staff member!"

"Oops."

<blank>

Was it a real staff?

I stopped the attack. If it was a lie, no problem, but the ref stopped it too, so it must be real.

<blank>

"Well, well, well, I think it's time for you to take a break."

"Hmm?　Is that an invitation to end up losing on purpose?"

Oh, no!　No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　I mean, for the sake of tournament progress, we're going to have to go to the waiting room!"

<blank>

What the heck, if that's the case, just say so from the beginning.

<blank>

I see. So this is the qualifying round, and the next round is the real thing, sort of?"

"!　Yes!　Yes, sir!　That's exactly what I mean!"

<blank>

Oh well, I see. It appears that they had to eliminate 11 people first to qualify for the main competition.

Well, it's almost like we just jumped in. It's a tournament with over 100 participants.

(I quietly started submitting new work for Kakuyom-Kon 9.

How a dungeon distributor who wants to be a lady someday becomes a real lady.

It is a dungeon delivery thing for aspiring young ladies!

What makes ...... dungeon different from the usual dungeon delivery thing is that the dungeon is in a game format,

Maybe not even muso, and the amount of money saved was at stake instead of lives,

(And I guess that means it's a Vtuber thing too. ......!)
