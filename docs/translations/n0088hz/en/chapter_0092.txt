# Elves Don’t Always Get Jokes, You Know?

<b>

"By the way, I left Sorashidore after drinking with Karikari and came all the way here… so when did you visit Vearald and meet an elf?"

"Oh, I got my hands on a super-fast ride. I raced from Sorashidore to Karukassa in five days."

"What? That’s twice as fast as a carriage. With that, you could go anywhere and drink to your heart’s content…!"

"It’s so fast that it’s not exactly safe. Plus, fuel efficiency? It supposedly guzzles down golem stones (at least that’s the official story), so you need a patron to cover costs. Also, it’s really bumpy."

"Ah, yeah, that sounds… rough."

<b>

For the record, it was supposed to consume a lot, but apparently, with a star-shaped engine, it can still reach that speed even on orc stones. Quite a technical breakthrough. We’re currently researching speed control through an accelerator and gears.

Oh, and I’ve stocked up on orc stones by thinning them out. So, there are plenty of orc stones… never mind, forget I said anything.

<b>

<b>

"Do dwarves and elves not get along?"

"Oh, yeah, you hear that sometimes. See, dwarf women look pretty young, right?"

"Yeah, Satie-tan is super cute."

"I may be, but I’m a mother, you know."

<b>

What?!

<b>

"Wait, a married woman… I think I like that even more…!"

"Huh, that’s the first time I’ve gotten that reaction. Well, I’m lying, actually. But I am old enough to have kids."

"Aw, it’s a lie? Well, I like it either way."

"Haha, I like you too, Karikari. Anyway, to other races, dwarf men are all seen as lolicons. To elves, especially, same-aged couples look like ‘an old man going after a young girl.’ Elves don’t even start growing beards until much later in life."

<b>

Ah, makes sense.

<b>

"And then one dwarf fired back, saying, ‘To us dwarves, it’s the elves who look like mature women going after young boys.’"

"So, an all-elves-onee-shota plan… that’s the idea?!"

"Heh, that’s also a first. Anyway, it was just banter over drinks, but you know how elves don’t always get jokes? That actually caused a bit of friction."

<b>

Yeah, Dear-kun does seem serious, too.

<b>

"Don’t worry, our elf is adorable and can take a joke!"

"A friend of Karikari’s, huh? …How did you two meet?"

<b>

Oh, how do I explain this?

To tell the story of meeting Dear-kun would mean introducing the great mage Karina-chan… let’s just keep things vague.

<b>

"I bought an alchemy textbook at Vearald’s magic shop, and we hit it off talking about alchemy."

"Oh, alchemy. I can make potions at least. Great for mixing into drinks."

"Oh, this is more like magic tools and stuff like that. I am interested in potions, though."

"I could sell you my old potion textbook. It’s one gold coin, but I’ll give you a special deal for ten silver coins."

"Deal! I’ll pay cash—I don’t have enough in my Merchant Guild account."

"…Karikari, make sure you’re not getting swindled. It’s fine, you can have it for free as a referral fee for the elf."

"Really? Then I’ll gladly take it."

"But no socks this time."

"Ack… don’t say that after I’ve already handed them over."

<b>

I took the textbook Satie-tan handed me and stowed it in my backpack.

…Apparently, ten silver coins wasn’t a special price after all.

<b>

"Well, you know, with the alchemy kingdom gone, these might increase in value."

"Wouldn’t it make more sense to make and sell copies, now that there’s no one around to enforce rights?"

"…That’s one way to look at it, I guess."

<b>

So, with official supply cut off but demand still high, piracy starts to spread…

There were manuscript copies to begin with, after all. I guess that’s how it goes.

<b>

<b>

Chatting along like this, we rode in a bird-drawn carriage and arrived at the inn district.

Judging by the spatial magic signals, it looks like Dear-kun and the others are… yep, Dear-kun is at that inn over there. Aisia seems to be somewhere else—probably doing research.

<b>

"Hmm. Not a bad inn."

"Alright, wait here. I’ll go let Dear-kun know."

"If you’re staying here, I think I’ll pick this inn too. I’ll go park the carriage."

"Got it. See you in a bit."

<b>

I got off Satie-tan’s carriage and headed into the inn… and there’s Dear-kun!

<b>

"Hey, big sis. I went ahead and booked the inn for a week."

"Oh, thanks, Dear-kun. Here’s a little allowance—half of the delivery fee. We’re splitting it as members of the adventurer party ‘Fakers’! Oh, and where’s Aisia?"

"She’s scouting nearby restaurants. She’s excited to find you some good food, big sis."

<b>

Ugh, so cute! But I won’t let myself be charmed… okay, maybe a little bit!

But I won’t relent—oh, right, Aisia is a half-dwarf.

<b>

I wonder if Satie-tan will be okay with a half-dwarf slave? I’m not even sure how to handle it. Sometimes half-breeds are persecuted… Satie-tan wouldn’t bully my girl, right?

Hmm. Well, since technically she’s considered my property, I’d like to think it’ll be fine…

Or could she dislike me for having a half-dwarf slave…?

<b>

Well, there’s no time to worry about it now; I’ll think about it later.

<b>

"Dear-kun, there’s a dwarf who wants to visit the elf country. Can I introduce her to you?"

"If it’s someone you recommend, big sis, I don’t mind meeting them. But whether they get permission or not depends on the person themselves."

"Got it. Oh, and keep the spatial magic a secret. I’ll go bring her—oh, she’s here."

<b>

Just as I was talking to Dear-kun, Satie-tan walked into the inn and waved when she spotted me.
