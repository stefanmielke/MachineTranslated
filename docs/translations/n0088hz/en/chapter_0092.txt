# Elves can't take a joke, can they?

'And by the way, I left Solacidore on the day I had a drink with Crunchy and came here. ...... When did you go to Velarde or get to know the elves?

He said, "Ahh. I got a super fast ride. I rode from Solacidore to Carcassa in five days."

What's that? It's twice as fast as a horse-drawn carriage. If you had such a thing, you could drink all the alcohol in the world. ......

'Too fast for safety, though. And the fuel consumption?　It eats up a lot of magic stone for the golem, so it's not worth it if you don't have a patron. Also, it shakes a lot."

"Oh, that's ...... yeah. That's tough."

<blank>

Incidentally, it was supposed to eat stupidly in the setting, but actually, in terms of fuel consumption of the star-shaped engine, it seems that even an orc's magic stone can achieve that speed. Wow, what a technological innovation. Currently researching speed adjustment by gas pedal and gears.

Oh, I thinned out a lot of orc magic stones, so I have quite a stock. In other words, there are a lot of orc magic stones ...... sorry nothing.

Do dwarves and elves ever get along?"

"Ah, I hear that sometimes. You know, Dwarf women look so young, don't they?"

Sati is so cute, isn't she?"

I still have children.

<blank>

Ma!

<blank>

"Eh, married women ...... love ......!"

Hmmm, that's the first time I've had that reaction. Well, it's a lie. But I'm old enough to have kids, me."

'Oh, you're lying?　I like that."

I love crunchy food, too. And you know what? Other races treat all Dwarf men as if they are pedophiles. Especially from the elves' point of view, a couple of the same age can look like a couple of "grandfathers messing around with a little girl. Elves don't grow beards until they get very old.

<blank>

Ah, I see.

<blank>

"And then someone said, 'Well, from a Dwarvish point of view, it looks like the elves are the ones who make it look like a MILF is messing with the boys.

"You mean the All-Elf Oneshota Project ......!"

I've never had that reaction before. Well, it was just a joke at the bar, but elves can't take a joke, you know?　That's why we had some conflicts.

<blank>

Ah, Deere, you seem so serious too.

<blank>

Don't worry, our elf is a sweet girl who can take a joke!"

'You're a crunchy fellow, aren't you? ...... how do you know each other?"

<blank>

Oops, I don't know how to explain it.

To tell the story of my meeting with Mr. Dear, the great magician Karina, let's blur it out ...... well.

<blank>

I bought a book on alchemy at Velarde's grimoire store, and we hit it off talking about alchemy."

Alchemy. I can make potions too. It tastes good when mixed with alcohol.

I'm interested in the potions, too. I'm also interested in potions."

I'll sell you my secondhand potions book if you like.　It's only 1 gold coin, but right now I have a special offer: 10 silver coins."

I bought it!　Oh, I'll pay cash. My merchant guild certificate is a little low."

"...... Crunchy, be careful you don't get suckered! Okay, okay, for free. I'll give it to you as an introduction fee for Mr. Elf.

"You don't mind?　I'll take it if that's what you want."

But no socks.

Ugggghhh don't tell me after I give you ......"

<blank>

I took the instructional book Satitan had taken out of her luggage and put it in my own backpack.

...... and the price of 10 silver coins did not seem to be a bargain.

<blank>

Well, well, well..." "Well, well. The alchemy kingdom was destroyed, right?　Maybe this kind of thing will be valuable from now on."

'I'd rather just add more books and sell them on their own, now that the rights holders are gone.'

...... can't we look at it that way?"

<blank>

Well, the official supply has been cut off, but pirated copies are still available when demand is high. ......

There are manuscripts and so on. That's not how it works.

<blank>

<blank>

While chatting like this, we came to the inn section, rocked by a horse-drawn carriage pulled by a bird.

From the response to the spatial magic, I'm guessing that Dea and her friends are at ...... Oh, Dea's at the inn over there. Isiah seems to be in a different place. I'll check it out.

<blank>

"Hmm. That's a decent place to stay."

I'm going to go talk to Mr. Deere. I'm going to go talk to Mr. Dia.

I'm going to leave the carriage here. I'll leave the carriage."

I see. I'll go ahead then.

<blank>

I got out of Satitan's carriage and went inside the inn. I found ...... Dear!

<blank>

Oh, sister. At any rate, I've got a place to stay in a week."

Oh, thanks, Dear. Here's your allowance. Half of the delivery order. We'll split it amongst ourselves as the Fakers, the adventurers' party!　Oh, and Isiah? And Isiah?"

I asked her to check out restaurants in the area. She was so excited that she wanted her sister to eat something delicious."

<blank>

Damn, that's cute!　I'm not bonding though, no lie, I'm bonding a little!

But I won't release them - I mean, come to think of it, Isiah is a half-dwarf.

<blank>

Satitan, I wonder if it is safe to be a half-dwarf slave or something?　First of all, I don't know how to handle half-dwarves. Sometimes there are stories about half-dwarves being persecuted, but Saty-tan, you wouldn't bully my child, would you?

Hmmm. Well, it's supposed to be my property, so I'd like to think it's okay. ......

On the other hand, it could be that you dislike me having half-dwarf slaves or something like that ......?

<blank>

Well, we don't have time to worry about it now, we'll figure it out later.

<blank>

I'd like to introduce you to a dwarf who wants to go to the elven lands. There's a dwarf who wants to go to the elven country and I'd like to introduce him to you, is that alright?"

If your sister introduced you, you can at least meet her. I don't know if I can give you permission to do so until I see you in person.

Yeah?"　Oh, you're keeping spatial magic a secret, aren't you? I'll go get him.

<blank>

Just as I was speaking with Mr. Dear, Satitan came into the inn, spotted me, and waved to me.
