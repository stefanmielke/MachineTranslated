# Hermes was commissioned (from the perspective of Hermes, the thief)

<blank>

Normally, Hermes is a thief who only steals from bad guys. This time, however, the situation is a little different.

The theft takes place in Akhagane, the capital of the dwarven nation of Tessin.

And the target is the sacred weapon "Breaking Wall Hammer".

<blank>

This was a request from the government.

<blank>

The world's fate is at stake, and if the sacred artifact is not recovered, the world will be destroyed in 10 years.

<blank>

Normally, I would have laughed it off as a joke, but it was the king who told this story.

Yes, the king himself came all the way to the slums of downtown, which is an absurdly small town, and bowed down to Hermes.

<blank>

Hermes, who is also a master of disguise, knew immediately that it was not a shadow warrior, and that he was not lying - or at least that he really believed it.

<blank>

Hence, Hermes accepted the request.

The theft of the "Breaking Wall Hammer," a sacred artifact that is displayed in a museum and would not be too much trouble even if it disappeared.

<blank>

<blank>

......

<blank>

His friends create a diversion and gather security on that side, while Hermes, his true love, steals in under the cover of darkness with his shoes in the sky.

Then, we went through the dwarves' guards to the roof of the central exhibition room. The glass skylight could easily be turned into a doorway with a little ingenuity.

<blank>

Security is thinner than I thought it would be. This may be an easier job than I imagined.

Such thoughts of Hermes' instantly fizzled out when he saw the scene in front of him.

<blank>

What, so there's a dragon in the museum ......!"

'Grrrrrrr ......'

<blank>

The pedestal where the "Breaking Wall Hammer" was originally placed. There, instead of a guard, a Thunder Dragon was sitting on the pedestal, holding the golden "Breaking Wall Hammer," a sacred weapon.

<blank>

When it comes to protecting treasure, there is no one better suited than the dragon. Dragons have a habit of hoarding treasure. They are natural treasure keepers, so to speak.

It is safe to say that there is no way to get away with messing with the treasure that dragons guard.

<blank>

"I'm not listening, this is ...... umm, but ......"

<blank>

I don't know how the dwarves of Akahagane got the dragons here. ......

There are no other guards, perhaps to keep the dragons from getting involved.

<blank>

Moreover, the chain connecting the "Breaking Wall Hammer" had been chewed off, probably because the dragon had chewed on the chain.

<blank>

This would have been out of the calculations of the dwarves, but it was convenient for Hermes.

We had some magical tools to deal with the chains, but they were quite noisy and somewhat time consuming, so this would speed up the job.

<blank>

Can we use the usual means, given that we have a ...... large beast guarding us?"

<blank>

Chains and dragons that were removed. Thinking it was zero plus or minus, I decided to continue with the job.

<blank>

<blank>

Hermes reached into his magic bag and pulled out one of his secret tools - a diversionary golem.

It moves on its own until the magic of the magic stone runs out, luring the enemy.

<blank>

It is a rather expensive magical tool, but it is a necessary expense. I have received that much money up front, and a reward is promised regardless of success or failure.

<blank>

Come on, dance ......."

<blank>

and throws the golem through the skylight. With a clatter, it fell close to the dragon, and he clapped his hands at the dragon, provoking it.

<blank>

Gurulu ......?"

<blank>

Dragon looks at the golem and nods his head. It's not very interesting: ......

<blank>

Gah!

<blank>

And, not so fast, it seemed, as the dragon left the "Breaking Wall Hammer" and pounced on the golem. She was done. Hermes quickly climbed down from the skylight with a rope and put a magic bag over the "Breaking Hammer.

<blank>

A quick move, just a few seconds of the dragon's attention on the golem. The dragon missed.

Hermes returns to the skylight, reeling in the rope with his magical tool.

<blank>

Guggo!"

<blank>

Once Hermes was outside, the dragon seemed to realize that the treasure he was guarding had been taken. It has no more use for this place. Hermes quickly leaves the scene.

<blank>

Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

The roar of the dragon echoes through the night sky of Akahagane like an alarm.

With that on his back, Hermes fled through Akahagane like the wind.

<blank>

No, yeah, this official "atogoji" account, the follow and RP campaign has just finished.

But there may be something in the replacement.
