# Hermes received a request (Perspective of the Phantom Thief Hermes)

<b>

<b>

<b>

Normally, the phantom thief Hermes only steals from villains. However, this time the situation is a bit different.

The theft takes place in the capital of the dwarf nation, Tesshin, called Akahagane.

And the target is the divine artifact, the "Wall-Breaking Hammer."

<b>

This was a request from the nation.

<b>

Apparently, it's a request that carries the fate of the world, and if the artifact cannot be retrieved, the world will perish in ten years.

<b>

Under normal circumstances, Hermes would laugh it off as nonsense, but this was told by the king himself.

Yes, the king personally came all the way to the slum area, which is quite audacious, and bowed his head to Hermes.

<b>

As a master of disguise, Hermes could tell right away that this was not a body double, and that he was not lying—at least, he genuinely believed it.

<b>

Therefore, Hermes accepted the request.

To steal the divine artifact, the "Wall-Breaking Hammer," which is said to be displayed in a museum and would not cause much trouble if it disappeared.

<b>

<b>

……

<b>

While his companions create a diversion to gather the guards, the real Hermes sneaks in under the cover of night with his shoes that allow him to soar through the sky.

He slips past the dwarves' guards and reaches the roof of the central exhibition room. The glass skylight can easily be transformed into an entrance with a little ingenuity.

<b>

The security is thinner than expected. This might be an easier job than imagined.

However, Hermes's thoughts were instantly shattered by the sight before him.

<b>

"Why is there a dragon in the museum...!?"

'Grrrr...'

<b>

On the pedestal where the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" was supposed to be placed, a Thunder Dragon was sitting, clutching the golden shining divine artifact.

<b>

There is no better guardian for treasure than a dragon. Dragons have a habit of hoarding wealth. They are, in a sense, natural and innate treasure keepers.

It is safe to say that one cannot simply take treasure guarded by a dragon and walk away unscathed.

<b>

"I wasn't informed about this... Hmm, but..."

<b>

While Hermes does not know how the dwarves of Akahagane managed to summon the dragon here...

To avoid getting caught up with the dragon, there are no other guards present.

<b>

Moreover, perhaps due to the dragon gnawing on the chains, the chains that were supposed to secure the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" had been chewed through and were now detached.

<b>

This might be an unexpected turn for the dwarves, but it was convenient for Hermes.

He had prepared magical tools to deal with the chains, but they would make quite a noise and take some time, so this would allow him to finish the job quickly.

<b>

"…If I think of it as being guarded by a large beast, I can use my usual methods?"

<b>

With the chains removed and the dragon present, he decided to continue with the job, considering it a net zero.

<b>

<b>

Hermes reached into his magical bag and took out one of his secret tools—a distraction golem.

It moves on its own until the magic stone's power runs out, luring enemies.

<b>

Although it is quite an expensive magical tool, it is a necessary expense. He has already received enough upfront payment, and the reward is promised regardless of success or failure.

<b>

"Now, dance...!"

<b>

He threw the golem through the skylight. With a loud crash, it landed close to the dragon and clapped its hands in provocation.

<b>

'Grrr...?'

<b>

The dragon tilted its head at the sight of the golem. It didn't seem very interested...

<b>

'Grrr!'

<b>

But it seemed that wasn't the case, as the dragon left the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" and pounced on the golem. Perfect. Hermes quickly descended with a rope from the skylight and covered the "Wall-Breaking Hammer" with his magical bag.

<b>

In just a few seconds of swift action while the dragon was distracted by the golem, the dragon failed to notice.

As Hermes wound the rope back with the magical tool, he returned to the skylight.

<b>

'Ugh!'

<b>

The moment Hermes stepped outside, the dragon seemed to realize that the treasure it had been guarding had been stolen. There was no longer any reason to stay here. Hermes swiftly left the scene.

<b>

'Gyaaaaaaa!!!'

<b>

The dragon's roar echoed through the night sky of Akahagane like an alarm.

With that behind him, Hermes dashed through Akahagane like the wind and escaped.
