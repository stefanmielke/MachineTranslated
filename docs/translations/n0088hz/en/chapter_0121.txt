# Is that the core?

He said he would retrieve a sock from someone he knew when he returned to the ground from the dungeon, and we exchanged contact information.

However, I can't give out my identity as an E-rank adventurer or a new merchant. Because I am now a great magician, Karina-chan. I have no choice but to use spatial magic.

<blank>

I picked up some stones from around there and processed them into the shape of a gradient ball. A little bit of spatial magic is applied by inserting a leather string through the hole, and the pendant, which looks like a communication device, is completed.

<blank>

Here you go. This stone is a communicator, so if you talk to it, it will fly away."

Tushinki?"

<blank>

Oh, that's where you're coming from.

<blank>

You know that thing where you use wind magic to send your voice to a place far away?　It's like that. Try talking to me. I'll adjust the volume, but please keep it low, and I'll cut out loud noises.

Oh. ...... hmm, uh, Karina?"

Oh-ho!"

<blank>

A whisper exploded in my ear!

It is an audio work that is pleasant and titillating to the ear!

<blank>

"Hey, what's with the funny voice all of a sudden?"

"I made an adjustment mistake. ...... No, this is it. Wear it anyway."

"Oh. Like this?"

<blank>

And Masilo-san put the pendant I made around his neck. A stone gradient caught in the fluffy valley of fluffy fur.

I hear a thump, thump, thump heartbeat. I like ...... heartbeat ASMR too. I can hear chewing noises and other echoes too. Yeah, it's not good for the stones. Privacy.

<blank>

"...... If you keep this up, your voice and all sorts of sounds will be able to get through to me. I'll give it two short pokes and I'll make sure your voice gets through."

I'll give it back early. Well, I'll get back to you as soon as I can."

'Do that. Oh, and if Black Mantis comes up again or something, you can use it to call him."

"Oh, ...... that's certainly possible. This is the first time Black Mantis has been exterminated in less than a week, so you never know what might happen."

<blank>

What's more, they say this is the first time the Mithril Devil has been defeated. I hear they don't know what will happen more and more. Hmmm, this is not going to keep me away from the dungeon either for a week or so: ......

I guess ...... is wherever I am if I metastasize. I guess I'll just have to be ready for the call.

<blank>

* * * *

<blank>

And then I was asked to learn even more about the dungeon.

<blank>

That's what I mean. In other dungeons, there will be different rules, but you know what not to do here? ......, even though it's a little late for that."

'Yeah, well, to add to that, it's OK to defeat the dungeon boss at the back here, and you're not allowed to touch the core beyond that. Okay, okay."

Even if I wanted to, I couldn't touch it because it's warded.

<blank>

If you hadn't told me, I'd have gone to touch it, maybe even bludgeoning it with spatial magic or going through it.

<blank>

I said, "All right, let's go see the core. Let's go worship the core."

"Oh, are you okay?　Dungeon bosses are strong, right?"

Black Mantis is ten times stronger. Here we go, Karina.

<blank>

Mr. Masilo stood me up and led the way saying that.

<blank>

Eh, I can go by myself."

What if I let you go out there alone and things get bad again?　I'm the one who's supposed to be watching you, so to speak!"

It is."

<blank>

Well, I guess I'll just follow what the senior adventurers say here.

And like Blade senior, he seems to be the more dependable senior!

<blank>

As for the Black Mantis carcass, I gave only the head to Mr. Masilo and all the rest is in my backpack (spatial magic through my backpack). I also gave him a slice of the mithril devil, so I'll leave the reporting to you, Masilo-san.

You can blab about me as a passing yabby great wizard or something, because I'm sure that if you inquire at the Velarde lordship hall, they will testify to my existence!

<blank>

<blank>

So I decided to challenge the dungeon boss accompanied by Masilo.

Holding back?　There's no need since I've already shown my ability to Mr. Masilo. So, the super giant ants, which were thought to be the queen ants, broke apart as soon as they appeared.

<blank>

I was prepared for it, but seriously, a dungeon boss kills you in a blink of an eye. It would take even Atashi a day to do that."

<blank>

With that said, slightly frustrated, Masilo took out a dart and fiddled with it. I wanted to be active, I'm sorry!

<blank>

I'm not sure what to make of the darts, but when I look at them again, they look exactly the same, as if they were made by a Dwarven master craftsman. ......

Oh!　Is that the core? And the wards?"

Hmm?　Oh. Yeah."

<blank>

When we proceeded to the back of the boss room, we found a passageway with a green ward and a black ball on a pedestal at the back of the passageway. Is that the core?
