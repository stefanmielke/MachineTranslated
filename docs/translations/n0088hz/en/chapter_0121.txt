# Is that the core?

<b>

After returning to the surface from the dungeon, I was told that they would retrieve a friend's sock for me, so we exchanged contact information.

That said, I can't exactly show my ID as an E-rank adventurer or a rookie merchant. Right now, I'm the great mage Karina. So, I decided to use spatial magic.

<b>

I picked up a stone nearby and shaped it into a magatama. I threaded a leather cord through the hole and cast spatial magic on it, completing a communication pendant.

<b>

"Here you go. This stone is the communication device, so if you talk to it, it'll reach me."

"Communication device?"

<b>

Ah, that's where it comes from.

<b>

"See, there's wind magic that carries your voice over distances, right? It's like that; your voice will reach me. Try talking to it. I'll adjust it, so please speak softly. Loud sounds will be cut off."

"Okay... um, Karina?"

"Whoa!"

<b>

A whisper exploded in my ear. Is this ASMR?!

It's a voice work that sends a pleasant shiver through my ears!

<b>

"W-what's with that sudden weird voice?"

"I messed up the adjustment... but this works too. For now, just wear it."

"Alright. Is this how it goes?"

<b>

With that, Mashiro-san hung the pendant I made around their neck. The stone magatama nestled in the fluffy valley of their soft fur.

I could hear a heartbeat. ...Heartbeat ASMR sounds nice too. Chewing sounds might echo as well. Yeah, that's definitely a problem. Privacy.

<b>

"…At this rate, all sorts of sounds will be transmitted to me. I'll set it so that tapping twice will let your voice through."

"Ah, yeah. Well, I'll return it soon."

"Do that. Oh, you can use it to call me if the Black Mantis shows up again."

"Ah... that could definitely happen. It's the first time the Black Mantis has been defeated in less than a week, so who knows what might happen."

<b>

Furthermore, it seems it's the first time the Mithril Devil has been defeated. Things are getting even more unpredictable. Hmm, it looks like I won't be able to leave the dungeon for about a week...

...Wait, for me, transferring means it doesn't matter where I am. Just preparing for a call should be enough.

<b>

So, after that, I got to learn more details about the dungeon.

<b>

"That's the deal. Other dungeons might have different rules, but you understand what you can't do here, right? ...Though it's already a bit late for that."

"Yeah, well, to add, it's okay to defeat the dungeon boss deeper inside, but you're not supposed to touch the core beyond that. Got it, got it."

"Even if you wanted to touch it, there's a barrier preventing it."

<b>

If I hadn't been told, I might have tried to break through or bypass it with spatial magic.

<b>

"Alright, since we're at it, let's go pay our respects to the core."

"Eh, is that okay? The dungeon boss is strong, right?"

"The Black Mantis is ten times stronger. Come on, let's go, Karina."

<b>

With that, Mashiro-san stood me up and led the way.

<b>

"Eh, I can go by myself."

"Shut it! What if something dangerous happens if I let you go alone? I'm basically your bodyguard!"

"That's true."

<b>

Well, I guess I'll follow the advice of my senior adventurer.

They seem like a reliable senior, just like Blade-senpai!

<b>

By the way, I handed over just the head of the Black Mantis to Mashiro-san, and the rest is stored in my backpack (through spatial magic). I also gave them one piece of the Mithril Devil, so I'll leave the reporting to you, Mashiro-san.

Just say I'm a passing great mage or something, and if they inquire at the lord's mansion in Verald, they should be able to confirm my existence!

<b>

<b>

So, with Mashiro-san accompanying me, I decided to challenge the dungeon boss.

Hold back? I’ve already shown my strength to Mashiro-san, so there's no need for that. Therefore, the super giant ant, presumed to be the queen ant, was torn apart the moment it appeared.

<b>

"I was prepared, but seriously, the dungeon boss was taken out in an instant. It would take me a whole day!"

<b>

Saying that, Mashiro-san took out some darts and started fiddling with them, looking somewhat dissatisfied. Sorry, I know you wanted to shine!

<b>

"...Hey, looking at these darts again, they seem exactly like the work of a master dwarf..."

"Ah! Is that the core? And the barrier?"

"Huh? Ah, yeah. That's right."

<b>

As we moved deeper into the boss room, we found a passage with a green barrier and, further inside, a black sphere resting on a pedestal. Is that the core?
