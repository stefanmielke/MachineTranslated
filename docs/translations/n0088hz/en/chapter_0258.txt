# Is it a blue demon?

<b>

I returned to the village with Dia-kun riding on the Black Dragon, Kirigon. Arthur is also following along.

Ah, regarding the barrier, I quietly manipulated it, so it's a free pass. I hacked the barrier settings and added Dia-kun as an exception.

From now on, feel free to come and go, Dia-kun. You are a maiden.

<b>

“W-w-w-w-whoaa, it’s a dragon!?”

“Eek, help meee!!”

“W-w-w-w-wait, wait, wait!”

<b>

The demons are panicking at the dragon that has landed in the village. Some of the more spirited ones are taking up weapons or martial arts stances.

Those folks, of course, notice Dia-kun above them.

<b>

“Is that… the priestess!? Hey, the priestess is on top of the dragon!”

“What!? We must rescue her…”

“No, doesn’t it mean she’s controlling the dragon?”

<b>

The demon tribe remains cautious and keeps their distance, though confused.

<b>

“Everyone, this dragon is safe, so please listen to what I have to say!”

“! You all! The priestess commands it! Lower your weapons!”

“As expected of the priestess! She’s controlling the dragon!”

“Wonderful… oh, priestess, priestess…!”

<b>

An old demon is putting his hands together and bowing towards Dia-kun. Yes, yes, please keep it up, Dia-kun.

Dia-kun glanced at me, so I nodded in response.

<b>

“It seems the dragon is not demanding a sacrifice. We will now search for the person who tried to pin the blame on the dragon, so please cooperate.”

“Hmm?”

“Yes?”

“...What do you mean by that?”

“Those who are uncooperative will be bitten by the dragon. The dragon is very angry because it is being blamed for something it didn’t demand.”

‘Oh, got it. So biting is the solution! Leave it to me, elf girl!’

<b>

Kirishon responded at just the right moment. Hearing the dragon's roar, the demons dropped to their knees and began to bow.

<b>

“...Then, first. Who was it that mentioned the sacrifice?”

“That would be… because the dragon appeared?”

“Ah, to calm its anger, we must offer a sacrifice.”

“Exactly. When it comes to dragons, it’s all about sacrifices.”

<b>

In front of the dragon, knowing they might be bitten if they remain uncooperative, the demons began to explain the situation smoothly.

<b>

“Please tell us who said ‘sacrifice’ before you did. That way, we can trace it back to the first person who said it, right?”

“! That’s certainly true. Look, it was Gonbe who said it.”

“I heard it from Youki-sama.”

“Eh, I heard it from my father.”

“Oh. I also heard it from the elder.”

“So did I.”

“Me too.”

<b>

And so, all eyes turned to the village chief.

<b>

“...I heard it from Tenshiki.”

‘Ah, that sounds suspicious. This guy looked away. Kirigon, please roar!’

‘You got it, Arthur. Grrr!!!’

“Eek!?”

<b>

The village chief jumped and lost his composure at the dragon's roar.

<b>

“I-I-I-I didn’t do it! It wasn’t me!?”

‘One more time!’

‘Alright. Grrrrrrrrrrr!!! Gaaaah!!!’

“Eek…”

<b>

…The village chief’s face is pale. Is it a blue demon?
