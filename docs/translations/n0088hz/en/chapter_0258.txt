# Is it a blue ogre?

<blank>

I returned to the village with Mr. Dia on the black dragon Kirigon. Arthur is also following us.

Oh, and as for the warding, I gently misled you, so you get a free pass. I hacked into the warding setup and added Mr. Deere as an exception.

Feel free to come by from now on, Dear. You are a maiden.

"D-D-D-DRAGON!"

Help me!

Aww, aww, aww!"

<blank>

The demons were in a panic as the dragons descended on their village. Some of the more spirited ones were readying their weapons or even their kung-fu.

Those people, of course, notice Mr. Deere on top of their heads.

<blank>

"Mi-Miko-sama!　Hey, the miko princess is on the dragon's head!"

What!　We have to rescue her. ......"

'No, don't you mean that they usually have dragons following them?'

<blank>

The demon tribe members, bewildered but wary, keep their distance.

<blank>

"Gentlemen, this dragon is safe, so please listen to me."

"!　You guys!　The miko priestess has spoken!　Lower your weapons!

'As expected of the miko princess!　You rule the dragons!"

"Wonderful ...... Oh, miko hime-sama, miko hime-sama ......!"

<blank>

The old demon is worshiping with his hands together toward Deer-kun. Yes, yes, please keep up the good work, Deer-kun.

Dia glanced at me and I nodded my head.

<blank>

It appears that the dragon has not demanded a sacrifice. Please cooperate with us as we will now be looking for those who have tried to pin the blame on the dragon."

Mm?"

Yes?"

...... what does that mean?"

The dragon gnaws at those who are uncooperative. The dragon is very angry because he didn't ask for the sacrifice and is being forced to take the blame for it."

'Oh, okay. I'll just take a nibble!　I'll take care of it, little elf!

<blank>

Kirigon responded at the right time. Hearing the dragon's cry, "Ha, ha! and the demons lined up on their knees.

<blank>

"At ......, first. Who was the one who started the whole "sacrifice" thing?"

Is it because the ...... dragon showed up?"

Oh," he said, "I must offer a sacrifice to appease his anger. I must offer a sacrifice to appease his wrath."

Yes, yes, yes. When you think of dragons, you think of sacrifices."

<blank>

In front of the dragon's eyes, the demons begin to talk about the situation with ease, knowing that if they are uncooperative, they will be gnawed off.

<blank>

Sacrifice, and tell me who said it before you did. That way we will get to the first person who said it, right?"

"!　That's for sure. See, that's what that Gombe guy said."

I heard it from Master Yohki.

"Well, I heard it from my father."

I heard it from the chief, too. I heard it from the chief, too."

Me, too.

And then, the eyes are drawn to the village head.

<blank>

I'm ....... Tenshiki told me.

He looked away. He turned his eyes away. Mr. Kirigon, please bark.

'Oh, Arthur. Garururu!!!!"

Hiccup!

<blank>

The dragon barks at him, and Satonaga jumps up and down.

<blank>

It's not me!　It's not me!

One more word!"

'Mm. Gulrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!　Gahhhh!

Heehee. ......."

<blank>

...... Satcho, you are blue in the face. Is it a blue demon?
