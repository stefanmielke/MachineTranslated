# The Five Elders and Masilo (The Five Elders' Perspective)

<blank>

I think the performance was a little too good for everyday use. The silk spider cloth I bought from Kari was pretty good quality."

But I thought I'd be satisfied with the fact that he wore it once."

It might have been overkill to layer each frill of the gothic dress with a different enchantment."

It was not good that it was difficult to put it on and take it off once it was put on. Improvement, improvement, improvement.

"Can't I at least ...... at least get a headdress?"

While the Five Elders were having a lively review meeting in the living room of their base, a Blutbad with a wooden box on his shoulder passed by.

I'm Masilo, an A-rank adventurer who goes to this base to use the baths.

<blank>

Hmm?　You're new here?　If you're here, you must know Karina, nice to meet you."

<blank>

Mashiro smiles with a grin. It is a wolf-headed smile that, depending on how you look at it, might make a child cry. However, the Five Elders did not cry because they understood from their abundant life experience that it was a pure smile of a beastman.

<blank>

Oh?"　You are a fluffy beastie, aren't you? Nice to meet you.

I'm a friend of Kari's." Are you an acquaintance of Kari's?"

Mofu, good fur ......"

I want to pet it. I want to pet it."

Wild charm?　Kari seems to like it."

<blank>

The first meeting between the Five Elders and Masilo began with this lighthearted greeting.

<blank>

Then, the Five Elders immediately cast a searching glance at Masilo.

It is an occupational hazard.

What weapons are used? What kind of equipment suits you? What enchantments fit?

You can't help but observe the personality of the person.

<blank>

The Five Elders can tell the general competence of an adventurer by looking at him for five seconds.

<blank>

--The only other person I didn't understand was Karina.

That was just an amateur with a dragon in tow.

<blank>

Hm. You're moderately good, but I'd like a little more."

I like the quickness," he said. I'd like to add a little more."

This fluffiness could use a little more polish."

B...... or just barely A-rated?"　A little more room for development."

There's no question that the wild side looks good on you."

<blank>

Its evaluation was "so-so.

The viewpoint of the Five Elders, who knew the finest, was somewhat dry.

<blank>

"Hmm?　What is it?

"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just my profession."

We are dwarves, you know. We are all craftsmen.

I'll make you something next time to say sorry, but it won't be for free."

I'll give you a discount for the sake of Kari's goodwill."

At the very least, I get paid for the materials.

<blank>

Five people look at Masilo smilingly.

<blank>

Hmmm. Well, that's okay. She seems to be older than me, and she doesn't have an asshole small enough to complain about something like this. Well, I'm saving up some money and can't afford it right now, so I'll ask you some other time.

<blank>

And Mashiro flutters his hand.

Yes, Masilo is in the process of saving money to order equipment from the Five Grand Elders, who are acquaintances of Carina.

So I could not afford to ask something from a nameless craftsman whom I had never met before and who was several years older than me.

<blank>

At ......, Mee-chan, aka Vermillion, the first of the Five Elders, began whispering in response.

<blank>

...... don't you think they know we're here?"

I'm sure if you'd noticed, you'd be very happy. If you had noticed, adventurers would be overjoyed."

I guess it's not like we're ....... I don't think the word is getting around that we're getting younger."

"What are you going to do?　Do you want to introduce yourself properly?"

I'd like to have a little fun with them. It'll give us a sample of how they'll react to us in the future."

<blank>

As a result, a response policy was agreed upon: "I'll keep quiet until Kari-chan introduces me.

<blank>

<blank>

Mashiro calls out to the five who have decided to respond.

<blank>

I'm not sure. Hey, we just met, you want a drink?　I just brought some crawler sake to leave here. I got a little discount on bulk purchases, but I felt like I bought a little too much.

<blank>

It might be a little small to drink with five dwarves, Mashiro says, as he places a box of liquor on the living room table with a clink.

<blank>

He's a good kid. This kid is a good kid."

I can bring out more of your talent!"

I'll make you a brush, Wachi."

I'll give you a hand with this. Super discount."

I, on the other hand, have a budding desire to dress them in cute little outfits."

<blank>

This is Carina's base and definitely a 'friend'.

That they try to buy me drinks to welcome me even though I told them I was saving my money.

<blank>

The dry rating easily turned sweet.

(For dwarves, anyone who buys you a drink is basically a good person.

He buys me a drink.)
