# The Five Elders and Mashiro (Perspective of the Five Elders)

<b>

"Maybe the performance was a bit too good for everyday use. The silk spider cloth I bought from Kari-chan was quite high quality."

"But I guess I'm satisfied since I got to see it worn at least once."

"Perhaps layering different enchantments on each frill of the gothic dress was a bit excessive."

"It was a problem that once it was worn, it was difficult to take off. Improvement is needed."

"At least the headpiece... is that too much to ask?"

<b>

<b>

As the Five Elders were having a lively reflection meeting in the base's living room, a wolf beastman carrying a wooden box passed by.

This was Mashiro, an A-rank adventurer who frequented the base to use the bath.

<b>

"Hm? A newcomer? Since you're here, you must be an acquaintance of Karina. Nice to meet you."

<b>

Mashiro smiled broadly. With a wolf head, it could be seen as a smile that might make a child cry. However, the Five Elders understood from their rich life experience that it was a pure smile of a beastman, so there was no crying.

<b>

"Oh? A fluffy beastman, huh? Nice to meet you!"

"Nice to meet you too. Are you an acquaintance of Kari-chan?"

"Fluffy, such nice fur..."

"It's so soft. I want to pet it."

"Wild charm? It seems like something Kari-chan would like."

<b>

The first meeting between the Five Elders and Mashiro began with such light greetings.

<b>

And the Five Elders immediately threw a scrutinizing gaze at Mashiro.

It could be called a professional habit.

What weapon does he use? What kind of equipment suits him? What enchantments would match?

They couldn't help but observe his character.

<b>

For the Five Elders, just five seconds of observation would reveal most of an adventurer's abilities.

<b>

――The only person they couldn't figure out was Karina.

She looked like just an amateur despite having a dragon at her side.

<b>

"Hmm. Quite skilled, but I want a bit more."

"Speed feels good. I'd like to add a little more."

"This fluffiness can be polished a bit more."

"B... no, barely A rank? There's still room for development."

"There's no doubt that wild styles suit him."

<b>

That evaluation was somewhere around "not bad."

The perspective of the Five Elders, who knew the highest standards, was somewhat harsh.

<b>

"Huh? What’s with the sudden scrutiny?"

"Oh, sorry, sorry. It's just my profession."

"We're dwarves, you see. Everyone here is a craftsman."

"As an apology, I'll make you something next time—though it won't be free."

"Since we have Kari-chan's goodwill, I'll give you a discount."

"I'll at least charge for materials, though."

<b>

The five smiled at Mashiro.

<b>

"Hmm. Well, that's fine then. You seem older than me, so I won't complain too much about this. But right now, I'm saving up money and can't afford to order anything, so I'll ask again next time."

<b>

With that, Mashiro waved his hand.

Yes, Mashiro was currently saving money to order equipment from the Five Elders, who were acquaintances of Karina.

So, he had no room to ask something from an unknown craftsman who seemed a few years older than him.

<b>

…Seeing this reaction, the first of the Five Elders, Vermilion, also known as Mi-chan, began to whisper.

<b>

"…Does it seem like he hasn't noticed us?"

"It does seem that way. If he had, he'd be overjoyed as an adventurer."

"Not completely oblivious... It's likely that the information about us rejuvenating hasn't spread."

"What should we do? Should we introduce ourselves properly?"

"Since it's a rare opportunity, I might want to have a little fun. It could serve as a sample of his reactions towards us in the future."

<b>

As a result, they decided to keep quiet until they were introduced by Kari-chan.

<b>

<b>

Then, Mashiro called out to the five who had settled on their response.

<b>

"Hey. Since it's a rare meeting, how about a drink? I brought some crawler sake that I thought to leave here. I bought in bulk, so it was a bit cheaper, but I feel like I might have bought too much."

<b>

It might be a little too little for five dwarves to drink, but Mashiro placed the box of sake on the living room table with a clink.

<b>

"Evaluation upgrade. This kid is a good kid."

"Yeah, yeah, I can bring out even more of his talent!"

"I think I'll make him a brush."

"If that's the case, I can lend a hand. At a super special price."

"On the contrary, I feel like I want to dress him up in cute clothes."

<b>

This was Karina's base, and there was no doubt they were "friends."

Even though he said he was saving money, he was trying to treat them to drinks for their welcome.

<b>

The harsh evaluation quickly turned sweet.

<b>

----------------

(For dwarves, a person who treats them to drinks is basically a good person.

Because they treat them to drinks.)
