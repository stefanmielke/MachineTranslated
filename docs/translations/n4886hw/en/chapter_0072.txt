On the night of August 31, the last day of summer vacation.

After getting out of the bath, I quickly returned to my room on the second floor, checked my status, and made a small fist pump.

<b>

The new skills "Design" and "Blacksmithing Techniques," which I had acquired out of curiosity, were honestly mediocre on their own, but when combined, they transformed into a "broken" skill.

<b>

First, "Design." This skill automatically inputs blueprints for tools I want to create from the materials I currently possess into my mind.

For example, if I specify "iron" as the material and activate the skill "Design" while wishing to create a "weapon," I can obtain blueprints for various types of swords, spears, guns, and even fighter jets and missiles.

Conversely, if I activate it while strongly wishing to create a specific item, it will consume extra MP, but I can pinpoint the blueprint and necessary material information for that item.

<b>

Of course, while I might ultimately be able to create such items, realistically, they are impossible to make.

To be blunt, obtaining blueprints for such things is of no use whatsoever.

<b>

The skill "Blacksmithing Techniques" solves that dissatisfaction.

<b>

This "Blacksmithing Techniques" skill allows me to create any tool as long as I have the blueprint and materials, consuming MP in the process.

<b>

In other words, with "Design," "Blacksmithing Techniques," materials, and MP, I can effectively create any tool.

――― If I turn a blind eye to one problem, that is.

<b>

In any case, since acquiring this skill, whenever I had free time, I conducted tests and practical applications of "Design" and "Blacksmithing Techniques," leveling up the skills and gaining experience points.

And today, I finally reached the significant milestone of level 120.

<b>

"......Alright"

<b>

I took out materials like iron from the "Item Box," input the blueprint for a "Pile Bunker" that appeared in a certain game using "Design," and attempted to actually create it with "Blacksmithing Techniques."

<b>

Until now, I couldn't create it due to MP constraints, but now that I've reached level 120...

<b>

As I activated the skill, the materials taken from the Item Box began to merge and transform into a single object.

<b>

Eventually, it was reconstructed into a weapon that was rugged, designed solely to drive a stake loaded inside into enemies, yet somehow conveyed a sense of elegance from the decorations applied in various places, and above all, it exuded a heavy presence.

<b>

"I did it..."

<b>

I couldn't help but mutter that as I looked at the completed item.

Joy welled up within me at finally reaching the desired level.

<b>

"I finally did it..."

<b>

At the same time, the fatigue from all this work hit me like a wave, and I collapsed onto my bed, taking a deep breath to calm myself.

<b>

It had been a long time.

Well, it had only been about two weeks since I acquired the skill, so it wasn't actually long, but I felt that way because that skill had given me so much trouble.

<b>

(But first, I need to put that away and check the skill)

<b>

I somehow regained my composure and stored the created Pile Bunker back into the Item Box, then checked "Blacksmithing Techniques" with "Appraisal."

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Blacksmithing Techniques

Effect: By preparing the materials and blueprints for the tool you wish to create at a certain skill level, you can create it by consuming MP.

Status: Skill Level 40/999

Supplement:

―――

<b>

The problem, which can be somewhat inferred from this appraisal result.

This skill "Blacksmithing Techniques" has an unusually high maximum level of 999, unlike other skills.

And as noted in the appraisal, a certain skill level is required to create tools.

For example, at skill level 10, I could finally create a low-quality longsword that might appear in Western fantasy, at level 20, a simple firearm, and at level 30, complex armor, and so on.

At the same time, the consumption of MP becomes a troublesome factor.

―――

<b>

The MP consumption for "Design" is 5, "Appraisal" is 10, "Item Box" is 40, and the MP consumed for creating this Pile Bunker was 400.

Just this alone shows how much MP "Blacksmithing Techniques" consumes.

<b>

I wonder how much MP and skill level would be needed to create the hero suit and aerial fortress from the previous incident.

<b>

"......Time to sleep"

<b>

For now, I should go to bed, feeling happy about being able to create such a complex tool and reaching level 120.

With that thought, I picked up the light bulb remote and turned off the lights in the room.
