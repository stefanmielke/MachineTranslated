# Chapter 95: One Trouble Passes, 5

"Hey, has Kyori-sama been found!?"

"Not yet. Where on earth is that little girl hiding!?"

"If this continues, the plan to elevate our family's status by crowning her as the head will...!"

"We need to find her quickly and arrange a marriage with my son...!"

<b>

In the courtyard of the Kuon family estate.

The members of the Kuon family and related houses who returned there were voicing their complaints.

For them, the most important task at hand was to gain the favor of Kyori, who was virtually confirmed to be the next head, and to reap the benefits.

However, with Kyori having vanished, they were thrown into confusion and dismay.

<b>

If Kyori remains unfound, the next head of the Kuon family will be that Kuon Genji by default.

They remembered what had happened within the barrier and had witnessed the savage nature of that man, Kuon Genji.

Even this alone disqualified him from being the next head...

<b>

"Damn it! That bastard, what a ridiculous thing to do... Ugh!"

<b>

Kuon Genji, who had been knocked unconscious by Kyori's shoulder throw, was currently bound by a shikigami, but from the moment he regained consciousness, he had been repeating bizarre behaviors.

<b>

"Why, why can't I even hit this piece of trash!?"

<b>

Kuon Genji tried to shake off the restraints by punching the shikigami, but for some reason, his fist struck not the shikigami but his own cheek.

<b>

"Damn... Damn... Why am I, the legitimate son of the Kuon family, in such a predicament...?"

<b>

The sight of Kuon Genji being led away to a confinement room by the shikigami while sobbing was so ridiculous that it convinced everyone, regardless of faction, that "if this man becomes the head, the Kuon family will be made a laughingstock."

That’s why they had to find Kyori, who had the strength, achievements, and education, as soon as possible and have her become the next head...

<b>

"Ugh! Is Kyori-sama still not found!?"

"I-I'm sorry! It seems that the abnormal ability user has done something..."

"Tch, that outsider!"

<b>

An elderly man thrust his cane into the ground in frustration.

The people in the courtyard were so angry and anxious about this situation that it could be said they had reached their limit.

If Kyori was not found soon, they would have to make that man the next head.

If that happened, it was inevitable that they would be ousted from their current position as the top exorcists.

<b>

That’s why they had to make Kuon Kyori the next head.

The members of the families connected to Kuon were using every means possible to search for Kyori, just then.

<b>

"---Everyone, I apologize for the trouble I have caused."

<b>

A dignified voice came from the largest sliding door leading to the courtyard.

As if guided by that voice, the elderly men turned their gazes, and there stood Kuon Kyori, the one they had been searching for.

<b>

"N-No, it’s not a bother at all..."

"Ah, I’m truly glad that nothing happened to Kyori-sama! Now, quickly, let’s proceed with the 'Ritual of Proclamation of the Head' at the central altar!"

<b>

The elderly men, as if the insults they had just hurled were lies, began to fawn over Kyori, urging her to complete the ritual.

In response, Kyori maintained her silence and headed toward the altar as they encouraged her.

<b>

Then, placing her hand on her chest, she took a deep breath before speaking.

<b>

"I have no interest in being the head of the Kuon family. I will pass the position of the next head to someone more deserving."

<b>

Those words from Kyori left the members of the Kuon family in shock, then confusion, and finally ignited their anger.

<b>

"What do you think the honorable history of the Kuon family is!? No interest!? The title of head of the Kuon family is not something that can be discarded for such a reason!"

<b>

A man with a thick beard shouted angrily as he approached Kyori.

Following him, several men and women surrounded Kyori.

However, Kyori, undeterred, looked around at them and declared.

<b>

"The honorable history of the Kuon family? Where is the honor in killing each other among family and accumulating wealth through corruption?"

<b>

Her bold words elicited a mixture of astonishment and anger from the adults of the Kuon family.

<b>

"H-Hahaha... It seems Kyori-sama is tired."

<b>

The bearded man who had approached Kyori let out a dry laugh and pulled out some talismans from his pocket, summoning several male shikigami.

Following that, several more men and women similarly summoned shikigami to direct them at Kyori.

<b>

...Now, this is where my job begins.

<b>

"Now, if you behave, you won't end up like that little one... Ugh!?"

"W-What is this!?"

"Damn! It won't come off...!"

<b>

The moment they tried to approach Kyori, round objects suddenly shot out from the air.

These objects transformed into an amoeba-like shape as they approached those who intended to harm Kyori, binding their hands and feet.

<b>

(“Dispel”)

<b>

At the same time, I appeared next to Kyori, having lifted the "Recognition Obstruction Magic," and used "Water's Eye" to collectively nullify and dispel the shikigami summoned to capture her.

<b>

"Iori Shu...!? I see... You are the one who orchestrated this ridiculous farce!"

"This outsider...!"

"You were the one who incited Kyori-sama, weren't you!?"

<b>

As the members of the Kuon family stirred at my appearance, those captured by the slime bullets I created using "Water Magic" began to hurl insults at me.

It seems they believe I incited Kyori.

Well, considering the legitimate son had just acted under the command of a monster, it’s somewhat natural for them to think that way.

<b>

But now, the hatred that was directed at Kyori had turned toward me.

Then let’s cause some chaos as much as we want.

<b>

"You guys don't genuinely admire the head of the Kuon family, do you? What you really want is the title that comes with being under the Kuon head. You want to use that to seize treasures from other weaker exorcist families and engage in dealings with criminal organizations to live a life of luxury. Am I wrong?"

"What are you saying! We would never do such a thing—"

"Oh? Then can you assert that you didn't sell the treasures of the Sato family to the yakuza two months ago?"

"W-Why do you know that...?"

<b>

At this very moment, I am using "Water's Eye" to activate "Identification" on everyone present.

Hearing the words "corruption" and "wrongdoing" has made them think deeply about it.

Thanks to that, I can see through all the shady things they have done.

<b>

"That person over there has illegally exported the remains of defeated youkai and valuable foreign objects to overseas mafias, and you over there have placed a curse of burns on the face of the only daughter born into a rival family, and you here incited youkai to wipe out a rival family and then stole the spoils. And you assisted Kuon Genji in poisoning the current head. Amazing, all of this happened in just the past year."

<b>

The reactions to my revelations of the various wrongdoings committed under the name of the Kuon family fall into two categories.

They either express confusion at having done such things or panic at having their past wrongdoings exposed.

And unfortunately, the latter is overwhelmingly more common.

This family has truly fallen to the depths.

<b>

"And then, all the responsibility is pushed onto the head, Kyori."

"Ugh..."

"Now you understand, right? The reason Kyori said she has no interest in being the head. Anyone would abandon such a rotten family."

<b>

As I said this, all the members of the Kuon family fell silent.

<b>

"So, Kyori will not inherit this family. Let those who still want to become the next head take the position, knowing this."

<b>

With that, I took Kyori's hand and headed toward the exit.

<b>

"Wait! Outsider, you think you can get away with this—"

"Oh, feel free to retaliate if you wish. But you’ll only end up doing something as ridiculous as Kuon Genji did."

"Wha...! That was you...!?"

"I should mention that I'm holding back. If you want to see what my serious side is like, I won't stop you."

<b>

The "Recognition Obstruction Magic" set on Kuon Genji and the corrupt exorcists present is designed so that if they attempt to harm someone with malice, they will instead strike themselves.

That seemed to have had a significant effect, as they fell completely silent.

Confirming that, we headed toward the exit without looking back.

Oh, right.

<b>

"---Ah, by the way, there’s a national agency that regulates abnormal abilities. I hear they are aware of what you’ve been doing, so you might want to brace yourselves."

<b>

Hearing that, I could hear someone collapsing behind us, but I didn’t turn around.

<b>

Thus, we escaped from the Kuon estate.
