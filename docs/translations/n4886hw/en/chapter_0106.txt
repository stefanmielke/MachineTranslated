# Episode 101: The Preparation for the Cultural Festival Has Begun 4

"Finally done..."

<b>

Having finished my homework and study for the test, I stretch and glance at the digital clock on my study desk.

The time is 8:55 PM.

The reply to the message I sent to Alicia arrived just as I got home, saying it was fine to call.

<b>

(Just 5 more minutes... It's a tricky time whether to study or kill time.)

<b>

It's better to inform her sooner rather than later, so should I just go ahead and call?

Just as I think that, my smartphone starts ringing. The screen shows Alicia's name.

I wonder if she was thinking the same thing as I tap the screen.

<b>

"Hello? It's me, is now a good time?"

"Yeah, no problem."

"Great! So, I have something I want to discuss with you."

"Let's put my story on hold for now. First, tell me what your request is."

"Got it. I just sent you an image on the chat app, can you check it?"

<b>

Following her instructions, I open the chat app and see an image of a giant red snake-like creature knocking down trees in the middle of the night.

<b>

"What... is this?"

"Part of a giant creature that's been causing a stir among some occult enthusiasts since summer. The Kuon family seems to think it's a serpent demon."

"A serpent, huh? So what do you want me to do about it?"

"The Kuon family originally intended to have this demon exterminated by Kuon Kyori, regardless of the results of the 'Selection Ritual.' However, with the reorganization of the Kuon family, those plans have been scrapped, and they haven't found an exorcist to take care of it."

"So you want me to go and exterminate that serpent?"

"That's a rough summary, yes. Of course, we have a sufficient reward prepared for you."

<b>

A sufficient reward, huh.

Since I started dating Kyori, I was thinking about getting a part-time job because I would need money, so Alicia's proposal is quite appealing.

<b>

"Alright, I'll do it."

"You're quick to decide, that's helpful. So, the extermination date is—"

"I'll go exterminate it right after this call. They say the early bird catches the worm, right?"

<b>

I'm not the type to procrastinate on homework.

If I can finish it, it's better to get it done sooner rather than later.

<b>

"Y-Yeah, understood. Today, right? That's all I have to say."

<b>

Alicia responds, slightly taken aback by my promptness.

Now that Alicia's story is over, it's my turn to share mine.

<b>

"Then I want to report or consult about my ability."

"About your ability?"

"Yeah, to get straight to the point, I met someone who seems to have an ability. According to them, they can make their delusions a reality."

"Making delusions a reality... That's quite an extraordinary ability."

"But that person doesn't think they're activating their ability themselves; rather, they seem to be annoyed that the power activates on its own. Is it possible for an ability to activate unintentionally and without awareness?"

"That happens quite often."

<b>

Alicia answered my question without hesitation.

<b>

"In fact, people like you who can activate their abilities from the start are the minority. Most ability users activate their powers unconsciously and live their lives without realizing they have special powers or what those powers are."

"Is that how it is?"

"Yes, because most ability users don't even know what triggers their abilities. Even if they accidentally activate their powers, it's nearly impossible to replicate that again."

"I see..."

<b>

Now that I think about it, I was given hints by that person on how to handle powers like a game.

If I were given such power without any warning, it would have taken a considerable amount of time to notice it on my own.

...Wait a minute?

<b>

"The person’s ability started going out of control? Or exploding? Apparently, it began after summer vacation. Based on your explanation, it means they’ve been pulling the trigger to activate their ability without awareness multiple times. Doesn’t that seem strange?"

"…It certainly is puzzling. Do you know when the last time that ability exploded was?"

"At the station in ■■ town, I think it was around 7:20."

"I'll check around that time. Just wait a moment."

<b>

Saying that, Alicia's voice goes on mute.

It's really surprising that they can confirm this much information.

Do they have a nationwide intelligence network, or is someone like me with an ability helping them?

Either way, it's still a scary thought.

As I ponder this, the mute is lifted, and I can hear Alicia's voice again.

<b>

"I checked the footage. Is the person you’re talking about Ikoma Juri?"

"That's right, but how did you figure it out so quickly?"

"I'm a professional, so I can do at least this much. Now, about this morning, there's a high possibility that an ability user was involved. However, I can't definitively say it was Ikoma Juri."

"What do you mean?"

"It’s possible that another ability user activated their power to make Ikoma Juri's delusions a reality."

"Oh..."

<b>

Thinking back, I realized that Ibaraki wasn't someone who had an ability but rather a puppet manipulated by someone with an ability.

That means someone could be activating an ability on Ikoma-senpai either as a form of harassment or unnecessary meddling.

<b>

"Alternatively, it could be that they had an unconscious stopper in place until now, but that has been removed, leading to the outburst."

"If I start thinking about it, the possibilities are endless..."

"Well, for now, we'll keep an eye on Ikoma Juri for a while, so you can just focus on flirting with Kyori."

<b>

Ugh, so they really knew.

I mean, if they can check right after hearing about this morning's events, they can easily grasp that we’re dating.

<b>

"...Please don't let the others know about this. It'll definitely become a hassle."

"I won't. If I did that, it would just increase our workload."

"Then I'm relieved. As for anything else... I'd like information about that serpent."

"Understood, I'll send you the materials right away."

"Thanks, I appreciate it. Well then, see you later."

"Yes, I wish you luck."

<b>

After ending the call, I shift my gaze to the time displayed on my smartphone.

<b>

(9:25 PM, surprisingly not much time has passed. With this, I should have enough time to exterminate the monster.)

<b>

Confirming the current time, I lock my room and, just to be safe, create a water puppet that looks just like me and lay it on the bed.

<b>

"Spatial Transfer Magic."

<b>

With my preparations complete, I transferred my body from this room to the clearing in the mountain.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"It feels like it's been a while since I've been here..."

<b>

After defeating the Ushi-Oni and using this place for various skill experiments, it was once a barren land with craters everywhere, but now it is covered in weeds and even flowers.

However, what caught my attention the most were the gigantic sinkholes scattered throughout the clearing, large enough for a tank truck to fit into.

<b>

Now, the rumored serpent has only been sighted with part of its massive body in the mountains, its body stained red like blood, and the sighting locations are concentrated around the mountainside.

But this mountain isn't large enough for such a massive creature to always hide.

So, the place I should search is...

<b>

"Yeah, this seems like a good spot."

<b>

Standing near one of the particularly deep sinkholes, I nod and use the surrounding stones as materials to create multiple drill drones with drill tips using "Design" and "Blacksmithing Techniques," sending them down into the underground tunnels.

After a short wait, I send in "Water's Eye," which has the functions to burst and shoot ice spikes that can penetrate iron, following the drill drones into the hole.

<b>

Once I confirm that, I take an MP potion and wait for the trap to activate.

If that serpent truly exists, it should be lurking underground in this mountain. I suspect that the sinkholes were created when the serpent appeared above ground or burrowed underground.

<b>

"Oh!"

<b>

As I ponder this, I see the red, slippery giant body lurking underground captured by "Water's Eye" through sensory sharing.

Alright, let's get started.

<b>

I stick the nearby Water's Eye close to that slippery body and make it explode dramatically.

At the same time, a rumble shakes the entire mountain, and I can hear something writhing from underground.

Whether it's panicking from the attack or angry, I can't tell, but the creature is moving at high speed through the underground tunnels toward the exit.

However, other exits have been filled to a degree that its massive body cannot pass through using the drill drones.

The only place it can emerge is this sinkhole right in front of me.

<b>

"...It's about time."

<b>

The rumbling becomes more intense, centered around my feet.

<b>

"――――――！！"

<b>

Then, in the next moment, it emerges from the ground, kicking up a massive amount of dirt.

Indeed, it is as massive as the rumors say, its body larger than a tank truck, its surface stained red like blood, and its body elongated.

However, aside from that, it bears no resemblance to a snake at all.

There are no scales where a snake should have them, and in fact, it has no eyes, ears, or nose.

The only similarities it shares with a snake, aside from its elongated body, are that it has a mouth on its head and fangs protruding from it, but even those are shaped like a lamprey, making it look nothing like a snake.

What lurked in this mountain was neither a demon nor a serpent.

It was a type of unidentified creature, the Mongolian Death Worm.
