# Episode 2: Level Up

"Big brother!"

"Whoa!"

<b>

A few hours after experiencing the rare event of viewing my status, my little sister Kana, who had come with Dad, hugged me with tears in her eyes.

<b>

"I'm so glad. You're safe, really..."

"Don't worry so much. The doctor said there's nothing wrong with me."

<b>

I said that, but if I were in Kana's position, I would surely be filled with the same anxiety.

To reassure her, I gently stroked my beloved sister's back, and Dad approached me with a worried expression.

<b>

"Are you feeling okay? You're really alright, right?"

"Even you, Dad... I'm really fine."

"…I see, that's good then."

<b>

Dad looked at my face and finally let out a sigh of relief.

It's honestly quite surprising to see Dad, who is a workaholic and rarely comes home, make such a face.

<b>

"Anyway, if you have any problems, just let me know right away. I'll leave some clothes here for you."

"Got it. Thanks."

"Of course, we're family. Well then, Kana, let's go home."

"………Yeah. Big brother, see you later."

<b>

With that, Dad took Kana and left the hospital room.

Now then.

<b>

As I muttered, a translucent board-like object appeared before me.

Fortunately or unfortunately, I have plenty of time right now. So let's make good use of this time.

<b>

"First, I need to check how to use the skills."

<b>

I picked up a paper cup nearby and thought "Appraisal."

<b>

"Target: Paper Cup

Condition: Good

Note: There is drinking water remaining inside the cup."

<b>

Then, a translucent board similar to the one that appears when using "Status" emerged.

What I understood from this is that the effect of "Appraisal" reveals the condition of the item, and that activating the skill and activating the status is the same.

Next, let's investigate the range of this skill.

<b>

I focused on the clock hanging on the wall in front of me and thought "Appraisal" again.

<b>

"Error. Appraisal of targets more than 2 meters away is impossible unless at least level 2."

<b>

The content displayed on the translucent board was quite troubling.

It's impossible unless at least level 2, which means if I want to appraise something, I need to level up...

<b>

"The problem is how to level up."

<b>

When it comes to leveling up, the image is usually fighting monsters, but in modern Japan, there are no monsters like slimes or goblins.

In such a situation, how am I supposed to level up?

<b>

"Well, I guess I'll think about that later."

<b>

I switched my thoughts and began testing the next skill, "Universal Translation."

<b>

I took out my smartphone, opened a video app, and randomly selected an overseas video.

As expected, I couldn't understand a word of what was being said in the video.

<b>

"Universal Translation"

<b>

Just like when I activated "Status" or "Appraisal," when I activated the skill, the voices from the video started to sound like Japanese.

Next, I opened a video with multilingual subtitles, selected Arabic, and hit play.

Then, even though I hadn't activated the skill, the displayed text automatically appeared to me as if it were in Japanese.

It seems that "Universal Translation" retains its effect to some extent once activated.

<b>

"Well, I need to confirm this too."

<b>

I paused the video and changed the language from Arabic to Japanese.

The content displayed was almost the same as what had been shown with "Universal Translation" earlier.

Hmm, it seems the accuracy of the translation is quite reliable.

Then next, I need to test how far I can translate.

Just then, when I opened a German video and activated the skill.

<b>

"…?"

<b>

I suddenly felt a strong sense of drowsiness and fatigue.

I shouldn't have done anything particularly tiring.

<b>

I gulped down the water from the paper cup to shake off the drowsiness and tried to return to my testing.

However, my body felt weak, and the drowsiness only increased.

<b>

Could it be... I displayed my "Status."

<b>

My magic power had decreased to one-tenth of what it was before I started testing.

...It seems that activating skills requires magic power.

And if I use too much magic power, I end up being attacked by drowsiness and fatigue, rendering me unable to do anything.

<b>

Fortunately, this is a hospital bed, so it shouldn't be a problem if I fall asleep like this.

<b>

With my last bit of energy, I wrote down what I had discovered in my smartphone's notes, then lay back on the bed and closed my eyes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Confirmed skill usage under extreme conditions. Confirmed acquisition of two languages. Confirmed appraisal of one item. Based on these results, experience points will be allocated."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…What the hell is this?"

<b>

The next morning, when I woke up, I was hit with an even greater shock than yesterday.

―――

<b>

For some reason, my level had risen by two in just one night.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

Since then, I have conducted further tests and learned various things.

First, regarding the fact that my level increased by two, it seems that I can gain experience points by successfully activating skills.

So, it's not just "activating the skill," but "successfully activating the skill," which is the important part here.

Yesterday, I tried to "Appraise" the clock that was far away, but I failed due to insufficient level. Therefore, I didn't gain any experience points from appraising that clock.

<b>

Next, I found out that if I consume too much MP when activating skills, it seems to have negative effects on my body.

For example, it seems that activating "Appraisal" requires 10 MP, while activating "Universal Translation" requires 15 MP.

Yesterday, I activated "Appraisal" twice and "Universal Translation" twice. The moment my remaining MP dropped to a level where I couldn't activate any skills, I was attacked by strong drowsiness and fatigue.

Fortunately, it seems that "if I sleep soundly for a night, my MP fully recovers."

<b>

So, what happens if I activate skills in that state?

So, I used my skills repeatedly until my remaining MP dropped to 5, and then I tried to activate the "Appraisal" skill in that state...

<b>

"…Ugh, this feels so bad."

<b>

Intense headaches, dizziness, fatigue, and nausea.

Honestly, I couldn't even get up from the bed.

Even so, I somehow displayed my "Status" to check my current condition.

―――

<b>

It seems that if I activate a skill when I'm low on MP, it takes HP instead.

...I really need to be careful about running out of MP.

<b>

For now, I will never try this again.

As I firmly vowed that, I reached out to the nurse call button to get an etiquette bag.
