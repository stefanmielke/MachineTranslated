# Episode 104: The Preparations for the Cultural Festival Have Begun 7

"Ah, I guess this is good enough."

<b>

On Saturday morning, after finishing cleaning the house, I poured some barley tea from the refrigerator into a cup and took a break.

It seems that my dad won't be back from work, so I generously gave Kana some lunch money and told her not to come back until the evening before sending her off to the kendo dojo.

<b>

(Shall I head out soon?)

<b>

The current time is 8:30 AM.

The meeting time is 9:00, but I can't relax at home because I'm worried about Kyori.

So, even though it's a bit early, I'll head to the meeting place.

I quickly changed into my outer clothes, stuffed my smartphone and wallet into my pockets, and stepped outside.

<b>

"Man, it's hot..."

<b>

According to the calendar, it's already autumn, but the temperature outside was not much different from a midsummer day.

I activated 'Wind Magic' and 'Ice Magic' to cool the inside of my clothes to the same state as an air-conditioned room and started walking toward the station.

◇◇◇

<b>

The day Kyori and I held hands while going to school, our relationship became known to all the students in no time, and we started feeling gazes from all over the school. We were bombarded with questions from other students about how we got together and when we became so close.

After all, a beautiful girl known as the school's angel, praised for her intelligence and good nature, suddenly started dating a plain mob character like me. It's only natural that they would be curious.

However, we couldn't honestly explain the reasons for our relationship, so we had no choice but to deflect the barrage of questions.

<b>

(That was really tough...)

<b>

As I walked, feeling a bit down about a trauma I never wanted to experience again, I realized I had somehow arrived in front of the station.

<b>

Since it was a Saturday morning, there were couples likely waiting for dates, enjoying each other's company in the square in front of the station.

Just a week ago, I thought those people lived in a completely different world from someone like me, but now I moved toward the monument with the clock embedded in it that I had set as the meeting point.

...There's still a bit of time before the meeting. I should memorize some English words while I can.

Thinking that, I reached for my smartphone—

<b>

(Huh? Is that...?)

<b>

In front of the monument, I saw a familiar girl checking her watch, wearing a slightly larger beige handbag, a sheer floral-patterned dress, and short boots, dressed for summer.

<b>

"Kyori? There's still time until we meet, you know?"

"Um, well. I just felt a bit restless at home... What about you, Shu-kun?"

"Uh, pretty much the same reason as you, I guess?"

<b>

It seems we both couldn't wait and ended up arriving early at the meeting place.

Understanding this, we both couldn't help but smile.

<b>

"Well, it's a bit early, but shall we go to my house? I don't want to stay in this hot place any longer."

"Sounds good. Please lead the way."

"Oh, right. Let me carry your bag. It must be tough to walk around with something heavy in this heat."

"But that would be a bother for you, Shu-kun—"

"This isn't a bother at all. ...And let me at least show off a bit."

"…Then, please do."

<b>

Kyori handed me her bag with an apologetic expression.

<b>

"Oh, there are snacks inside, so please don't handle it roughly."

"Snacks?"

"Yes. I thought we could share them with you and your family."

"Oh, thank you for going out of your way for that. Well then, let's head out."

<b>

<b>

I took Kyori's hand, and we started walking toward my home.

There were no abnormalities in the footage sent from the surveillance drone via 'Sensory Sharing.' In that case, I don't need to be too tense.

<b>

"Um, this might be a bit late to ask, but what about your family today, Shu-kun?"

"They're all out, so it'll just be the two of us until around 5 PM. Oh, and this might be a bit late too, but what should we do for lunch?"

"…What should we do? I can't just use your family's ingredients without permission..."

"That's not something you need to worry about... But cooking and cleaning up is a hassle, and going out to buy food in this heat is also a pain..."

<b>

Wait a minute. Since it's a rare opportunity, how about ordering that for the first time in a while?

I just happened to have some money from my part-time job hunting UMA.

<b>

"…How about we order pizza for delivery? It's easy since we just have to wait, and cleaning up is simple too."

"Pizza!? The one with dough topped with cheese and toppings!?"

"Y-Yeah, that pizza... Did you perhaps dislike it?"

"N-No, I don't dislike it. Actually, I haven't had the chance to eat that kind of junk food until now..."

<b>

Ah, it seems like in her house, there wouldn't be any opportunities to eat junk food, and the meal I was given after being cared for post-battle with the Ushi-Oni was also very health-conscious.

<b>

"So, um, now that I'm free from that house, I'm really interested in pizza and hamburgers..."

"I got it. Then lunch today is definitely pizza."

<b>

While we were chatting, we arrived at our destination.

Yep, Dad's car isn't here, and there's no sign that Kana has returned.

<b>

Confirming that no one was home, I opened the front door.

<b>

"It's really an empty house, but please come in."

"I-I'm sorry for intruding..."

<b>

Both Kyori and I entered the house with a rather awkward demeanor.

It's been almost two years since we moved here. I had gotten used to thinking of it as my home, but with someone else here, it felt like a stranger's house.

<b>

"First, just relax in the living room. Oh, what would you like to drink?"

"Um, anything is fine."

"Got it. Then I'll bring some barley tea."

<b>

Saying that, I headed to the kitchen, took out a pot of chilled barley tea from the refrigerator, and poured it into a cup.

Still, inviting my girlfriend to my house makes me so nervous...

In fact, when was the last time I invited a friend over?

When I hung out with Rentaro and the others, it was basically always outside...

<b>

As I thought about this, I carried the wooden tray with the barley tea into the living room, where Kyori was sitting properly in seiza but seemed to be curious about something in the corner.

<b>

Ah, if something like that is there, it's only natural to be curious.

In fact, I had completely forgotten about hiding that since I usually tried not to let it enter my line of sight.

<b>

"Kyori, I brought the tea."

"Ah, thank you. I'll have some."

"…You’re curious about that, huh?"

"To be honest..."

<b>

What Kyori was curious about, and where I directed my gaze, was the Buddhist altar and the memorial photo.

In the memorial photo, there was a woman in her thirties with a gentle smile.

<b>

"Um, who is this person...?"

"My mom. She died in a car accident five years ago."

"I-I'm sorry. I asked an inconsiderate question..."

"I don't mind it anymore, so it's fine. More importantly, let's start our study session. We don't have much time before the midterms."

"…You're right."

<b>

Perhaps sensing my wish for her not to touch on this topic any further, Kyori shifted her gaze to the study materials spread out on the table.

Grateful for Kyori's consideration, I covered the Buddhist altar and memorial photo with a white curtain.

<b>

I never want to remember that accident, or that time, ever again.

Wishing that deeply from the bottom of my heart, I returned to Kyori.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah, keeping my brain working is really tiring..."

"Yeah. Shall we take a break soon?"

"I agree. Continuing to study like this doesn't seem to be getting anything into my head."

<b>

After about four hours of our study session, having managed to cram the physics material into my head, I placed my mechanical pencil on the table and declared my defeat.

On the other hand, Kyori still seemed to have plenty of energy, but she said that to match my pace.

<b>

Actually, the purpose of this study session was to teach each other, but in reality, I had been the one receiving all the teaching from Kyori.

It seems that Kyori had already covered the curriculum a year ahead, so her test studying was more like a review, and my notes, which I had taken while she was absent, were only useful for confirming what she needed to review.

Conversely, I was just a burden, relying on Kyori to explain everything I didn't understand. Moreover, her teaching method was so thorough that even someone at the bottom of the class could likely rank high if they had Kyori helping them.

However, this arrangement hardly seemed fair for me, who had only shown her my notes...

...Maybe I should treat her to lunch, even if I'm not great at it.

<b>

<b>

"It's a bit late, but shall we order lunch? Kyori, are you really okay with pizza?"

"Yes! Please go with that!"

<b>

After glancing at the clock, I reconfirmed with Kyori, and she seemed so excited about the pizza that she responded energetically.

Hearing that, I opened the delivery app and went to the pizza shop's order page, showing it to Kyori.

<b>

"Alright, which one should we get?"

"There are various options on the menu. What are these half and quarter sizes?"

"You can enjoy different flavors on one pizza. Half means two types, triple means three types, and quarter means four types. You can also choose between a fluffy or crispy crust."

"I see, this seems like it could be a lot of fun to try..."

<b>

Watching Kyori seriously examine the menu was a heartwarming sight.

<b>

Right now, I'm enjoying happiness like never before. So...

<b>

<b>

『Living with that person and Kana, away from my mother. That is the happiest way of life for you.』

<b>

So please, don't make me remember that time again.
