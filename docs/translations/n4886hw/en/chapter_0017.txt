# Episode 15: Invited by the Angel of the Academy

"Yawn, I'm so sleepy."

<b>

As soon as I sat down at my desk at school, a big yawn escaped me.

I stayed up too late last night. When lunch break comes, I'll quickly eat and dedicate the rest of the time to napping.

<b>

"Another big yawn, huh?"

"Huh? Oh, I was doing various things yesterday."

<b>

A male student sitting in front of me started talking.

This guy is Rentaro Asama, a friend I've gotten somewhat close to since entering school, and we casually chat.

<b>

"What’s up? Did you find some dirty video or something?"

"Not at all. My wristwatch broke, and I was desperately trying to fix it."

<b>

Saying that, I took out the wristwatch wrapped in cushioning material from my bag and showed it to him.

<b>

"Hmm? At a glance, it doesn't look broken."

"Looks can be deceiving. This thing starts ringing the alarm at random times that I haven't set."

<b>

Last night, while I was taking a bath and sleeping in bed, suddenly the alarm on this wristwatch started blaring.

At that time, I thought I must have accidentally pressed something while half-asleep, but it started ringing again within a few minutes.

Ultimately, this wristwatch rang out its alarm sound throughout the room over a dozen times in one night, and I ended up unable to sleep properly before coming to school.

Well, the reason it broke like this was completely my own fault for giving it too much shock when I knocked that monster away yesterday.

<b>

"So, what are you going to do about it?"

"I'm going to take it to the shop and see if it can be repaired. If not, I'll have to buy a new one."

"It still works as a watch, right? If you're getting a new one, can you give me this one?"

"Sure. I'll sell it to you for 3000 yen."

"You're charging me...?"

"Of course. Besides, I'm giving you a pretty good discount here."

<b>

As we were having that casual conversation, the classmates around us started to stir.

<b>

"Kyori-san, what happened to your bandages!?"

"I sprained my ankle, but it's nothing serious, so please don't worry."

<b>

Kuwon, who entered the classroom, had bandages wrapped around her knees and ankles.

Seeing that, her close classmates called out to her with concern.

<b>

Now, Kuwon Kyori had become the "Angel" of this grade, no, of this school.

With her beauty, friendly demeanor, top scores in entrance exams, athletic prowess, and being the daughter of a prestigious family, she had it all.

As a result, in just one week, Kuwon Kyori reigned at the top of not just the class hierarchy but the entire school hierarchy.

If she showed up to school with bandages on her knees and ankles, it was bound to cause a stir.

<b>

(…Still, what was that all about last night?)

<b>

It was clear that it wasn't some cosplay photo shoot. I couldn't imagine Kuwon doing something like that.

More than anything, that demon was undeniably not human, but a monster. The results of the "Appraisal" skill prove that.

However.

<b>

("Appraisal")

<b>

―――

<b>

Kuwon Kyori, Human, 15 years old

Condition: Minor cuts and bruises on arms, knees, and shoulders

Notes: Injured during a battle with a demon on orders from the main family and is in a state of fatigue

<b>

―――

<b>

<b>

By using "Appraisal" on a human, all I can understand is what "condition" that person is currently in and some "notes" regarding that condition.

If the person has a criminal record, additional notes about that would be included, but since it has nothing to do with Kuwon, I’ll skip that.

What I want to say is that I have no idea what kind of background Kuwon has or what the main family is.

<b>

If I could just ask her directly, this confusion would probably be resolved, but unfortunately, she and I live in different worlds.

More than anything, that night, I activated the "Recognition Disruption Magic" skill to ensure she wouldn't remember my face.

If I suddenly started talking to her, Kuwon would definitely be suspicious, and I'd stand out in class for sure.

<b>

Should I really just completely forget about that day?

No, but forgetting that...

<b>

"…Hey. Hey, Shu."

"Huh?"

"You seemed to zone out and freeze up halfway through. Are you okay?"

"Sorry, sorry. I was overwhelmed by sleepiness and everything..."

<b>

When I think deeply, I inevitably get sleepy. Today and tomorrow, I'm not on housework duty, so maybe I'll just sleep soundly when I get home.

<b>

"Still, I wonder if Kuwon is okay."

"She said she just sprained her ankle, so she should be fine. Besides, for us, talking to Kuwon is just a distant dream, so I don't think worrying too much about it makes sense."

"Ugh... That's true."

<b>

Understanding the difference in our positions, Rentaro slumped his shoulders and hung his head.

And by actually saying it out loud, I too felt a sense of resignation.

Moreover, unlike Fujisawa-san, she isn’t suffering from being a victim of a crime.

So, there's no need for me to do anything about it.

<b>

As I was thinking that...

<b>

"Bee! Bee!"

"Whoa!? What the!?"

<b>

The alarm on my wristwatch suddenly went off, causing Rentaro to jump up.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"!"

"Mi-chan, is something wrong?"

"N-no, I just got a little surprised..."

"Is that so? Then—"

"…I'm sorry. I need to step away for a bit."

"Mi-chan!? Kuwon-san!?"

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

After managing to stop the alarm and apologizing to my classmates for the disturbance, I returned to my seat.

<b>

"That's worse than I thought."

"What are you going to do? Are you going to buy it for 3000 yen?"

"I'll politely decline."

<b>

I wrapped the wristwatch in polyethylene cushioning material to prevent the sound from leaking and put it back in my bag.

I'm sure when I take it to the shop, they'll probably recommend buying a new one.

<b>

"…!??"

<b>

While I was thinking about that, Rentaro's expression changed.

I wondered if something had happened, and as I was idly thinking that...

<b>

"—Iori-san."

<b>

A voice that should definitely not be audible reached my ears.

When I cautiously turned around, there stood Kuwon Kyori looking down at me with a serious expression.

<b>

"Um, what is it?"

"I'm sorry. Can we meet after school today?"

"…Ah, that's fine."

"Is that so?"

<b>

I had intended to go get my wristwatch repaired, but it wasn't an urgent matter.

Thinking that, I replied, and Kuwon took out a piece of memo paper from her pocket, wrote something on it, folded it, and handed it to me.

<b>

"I will be waiting at the location on this memo after school."

<b>

After saying that, she returned to her friends.

<b>

"Shu~u~?"

<b>

Before I could even think about what that was all about, the gazes of the surrounding students (mostly boys) pierced through me.

<b>

"Hahaha..."

<b>

This seems like it’s going to turn into a really troublesome situation.

Feeling that instinctively, I began to think of a way to navigate through this chaotic scene.
