# Episode 36: A Sister's Recollection 3

――side Kana

<b>

The monster lurking beside Seina looked down at us with a somehow smiling expression, despite having no mouth or nose.

However, Seina paid no mind to the monster and took out her smartphone from her jacket pocket, beginning to operate it.

<b>

“W-what the hell is that!? What are you planning to do to us!?”

“—Do you remember this?”

<b>

Seina showed the screen to the tall, crying girl so that I could see it too.

Upon seeing it, the girl's expression turned pale.

<b>

There was a video capturing them bullying students from a different school or shoplifting.

<b>

“W-why do you have that—”

“He did all of this for me. There are many people in this town who act as his eyes and ears. So whatever you do, wherever you go, it’s all being watched.”

<b>

Seina said this with a smile, but her eyes remained dark.

Is this just a judgment play, or something else—?

<b>

“Honestly, I intended to just show this to threaten you into not doing anything further. But since I’ve been shown something like this, well…”

<b>

As she said that, Seina played the video, which showed them gathered under an eave discussing something.

<b>

“Isn’t that guy just so annoying?”

“Getting all worked up over just messing up that creepy otaku’s stupid manga? His boiling point is way too low.”

“I’ve got a great idea! Let’s frame him as a criminal!”

“Your uncle is a big shot in the police, right? Then it should be easy.”

“Right. He sided with that creepy otaku and even grabbed my collar. I can’t just let that go.”

<b>

Seeing that, the faces of the trio turned even paler.

It seems they had been plotting something against me as well.

It’s only natural to feel anger and disgust after being shown something like that. However, I felt an even stronger sense of discomfort from the cold emotions emanating from Seina.

<b>

“T-this is just something I said on a whim…”

“W-we haven’t done anything yet! So—”

<b>

“—So what? You were trying to take away my last treasure?”

<b>

In the next moment, a tentacle-like appendage extended from the monster and pierced the thigh of the girl who tried to explain.

The blood that splattered onto the other girls made them scream in unison.

<b>

“I’ve avoided the artery, you know? You’re going to experience a lot of pain from now on, and then I plan to deliver the final blow.”

<b>

No sooner had Seina said that than the monster extended its tentacles again, piercing the thighs and arms of the girls.

<b>

“Kana-chan is my last treasure left. Since you tried to take that away, you must receive an appropriate punishment.”

<b>

…This is not good. I can’t let Seina do this.

<b>

Without thinking, I hugged Seina from behind.

<b>

“What’s wrong, Kana-chan?”

“It’s not okay, Seina. You can’t dirty your hands for these scum. You should consult your parents or the police, or find another way—”

<b>

Hearing that, Seina gently released my hands and looked at me with a somewhat sad expression, smiling.

<b>

“Kana-chan, my parents have only cared about Sei-nii and have left me alone all this time. I’ve never been celebrated for my birthday or Christmas; I’ve always been sidelined.”

“Seina…”

“And when that brother died in an accident two years ago, they told me to ‘follow in his footsteps’ and took away all my treasures, then blamed me when they found out I was being bullied. How could I rely on people like that?”

“…”

“At such a time, he came to save and guide me. He appeared before me and set the stage for my revenge. So I have to see it through!”

<b>

That was likely Seina’s heartfelt cry.

She had been suffering all along. Living alone in a situation where no one was on her side.

It was a hell I couldn’t even begin to fathom, blessed as I was with a father, brother, and seniors.

――Even so.

<b>

“Then rely on me! If Seina is suffering, I’ll be by your side! I’ll do something about it! So—”

“Kana-chan…”

<b>

Perhaps my words reached her. Seina turned to face me.

<b>

“Can I really rely on you?”

“…Yeah.”

“Will you really take the time for someone like me?”

“…Yeah.”

“Will you really stay with someone like me?”

“…Of course.”

<b>

Then Seina stopped walking and hugged me while crying.

As I comforted her and looked over her shoulder at the trio, they had fainted, foaming at the mouth in fear.

<b>

I guess that settles it.

Just as I thought that.

<b>

<b>

“Boring. You’re swayed by trivial emotions.”

<b>

Suddenly, a voice that didn’t seem human echoed.

The owner of that voice—the monster resembling a marionette directed a contemptuous gaze at Seina and extended a tentacle towards her back.

<b>

“Eek!?”

“Seina!?”

<b>

The monster manipulated Seina like a puppet, making her grip a knife and move toward the trio.

<b>

“Your role is to complete the ritual, to offer blood and hatred to me for the fulfillment of the Yomotsu Kuni. I will not allow you to escape this duty.”

“K-Kana-chan…!”

“Get away from Seina!”

<b>

I tried to pry Seina away from the monster with my shinai.

However.

<b>

“Hmph, what a fragile power.”

<b>

When the monster swatted me away with its massive arm, I crashed violently into the wall.

The metallic taste filled my mouth, making me want to vomit.

<b>

…We promised. I said I would do something about it…

<b>

“Now, my minion, plunge that blade into these girls!”

“No… stop it…”

<b>

While this was happening, the monster brought Seina closer to the fainted trio.

I had to stop it; I gathered all my strength and willpower to stand up, but my body wouldn’t move due to the fear of that monster.

<b>

…Is there really nothing I can do?

Just as I was about to sink into despair myself.

<b>

“Now, plunge that blade—UOAAAAAHHH!?”

<b>

Something resembling an ice ship burst through the window, shattering the curtains and crushing the monster against the wall.

The impact severed the tentacles, and Seina staggered.

<b>

“Seina!”

<b>

I managed to stand and support Seina’s body.

<b>

“...Kana-chan?”

“Seina, I’m so glad. Really…”

<b>

At that moment, I noticed a figure on top of that ice ship.

<b>

“Looks like it’s a close call.”

<b>

It was a person I knew well—my brother.
