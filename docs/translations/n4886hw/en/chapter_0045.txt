# Episode 41: The Forest School Has Started 2

――Sorry for the sudden message. Is it okay if I call you tonight? There’s something I want to discuss regarding this forest school.

<b>

The message from Kuon arrived while I was hurrying home after school.

From the text, it seemed like it was something she wanted to talk about just between the two of us.

I had household chores today, but since there wasn’t much to do, I had no reason to decline.

<b>

<b>

"Sure. It would help if you could call after 8 PM."

"I understand. Then I will call around 8:30 PM."

<b>

<b>

After exchanging such messages, I finished my chores, petted the cat, and lazed around in bed a little past 8:30 PM.

As the message indicated, I received a call from Kuon.

<b>

"Hello?"

"I'm sorry for calling so late. This is Kuon. Is now a good time?"

"Yeah, it's fine. So, what did you want to talk about?"

<b>

As I asked, Kuon took a breath and seemed to gather her thoughts before speaking.

<b>

"Do you know about the legend related to this forest school, Iori-kun?"

"…Legend? Oh, the one where if you watch a campfire with someone you like on the last day, your wish will come true?"

"Is there such a story!?"

<b>

Suddenly, a loud voice came from my smartphone, and I was so surprised that I instinctively pulled my ear away from the screen.

…I was shocked. I never thought Kuon would raise her voice like that.

<b>

"I-I'm sorry. I got a bit flustered..."

"Hey, it's okay. But based on your reaction, is the legend you were going to talk about something different from that?"

"…Yes. To be more precise, it's a legend related to the area where we will be staying this time."

<b>

With that preface, Kuon began to recount a legend that has been passed down in that region for a long time.

<b>

According to it, the mountain we are supposed to climb this time was where a samurai and a princess fled during the Warring States period.

The reasons for their flight vary according to different accounts, but all of them end in tragedy, with them being captured by pursuers.

<b>

However, there was more to this story.

<b>

The soul of the samurai, who met an untimely end, did not find peace and instead resided in the sword he had used throughout his life, moving on its own to slay the pursuers who had killed him.

<b>

It is said that the sword mercilessly killed anyone who approached the place where the bodies of the samurai and the princess had decayed.

<b>

And thus, the "Cursed Sword Legend" was born.

<b>

<b>

"…That's quite a disturbing legend."

<b>

It was a stark contrast to the campfire legend, filled with tragedy and horror, making me involuntarily recoil.

<b>

"So, how much of that is true?"

"…To be honest, it's hard to believe. Even after searching through past records, there were no records of exorcists being dispatched to that area."

<b>

So that cursed sword legend is probably just a fairy tale or something.

…Huh? If that's the case, why did Kuon tell me this story?

<b>

"I wanted to tell you this because there is a possibility that this legend could become reality."

<b>

As if sensing my inner thoughts, or perhaps just by coincidence, Kuon began to speak in response to my question.

<b>

"What do you mean by the legend becoming reality?"

"…Currently, the balance of spiritual power across Japan is greatly unstable. It could very well lead to the birth of an entirely new youkai at any moment."

<b>

Youkai.

If I had heard this a few months ago, I would have dismissed it as mere occult nonsense, but through my encounters with Kuon and battles against the Ushi-oni and the Nine-Tails, I now know they are real.

<b>

"Most youkai are born from fear or belief among people. And if a considerable number of people believe in this cursed sword legend during this time..."

"It means that the cursed sword could really appear. Ah, could it be that you volunteered for the ghost-hunting role to..."

"Yes. It's to check if such stories are circulating and to confirm whether this mountain is a situation where youkai could emerge."

<b>

I understood Kuon's explanation.

Being assigned to climb the mountain and carry supplies separately from the daytime climb was indeed for that reason.

<b>

"So, Iori-kun, I want you to be on the lookout for any rumors or legends in your role. Of course, I will compensate you for your efforts."

"Wait, you're going to pay me just for that?"

"Considering the possibility of an emergency, yes. Besides, most exorcists earn their income from such simple investigation requests."

<b>

I don't quite understand the circumstances of exorcists, but if that's normal, then I won't hesitate to accept it.

Even if that cursed sword legend were to become a reality, at that time――.

<b>

"And if you sense any dangerous presence, please do not rush in alone, okay?"

"Y-Yeah. Of course, I understand. For now, I just need to be on the lookout for any suspicious stories."

"That's fine then. I'm sorry for taking up your time. That concludes our conversation."

"Got it. See you tomorrow at school."

"Yes, see you tomorrow."

<b>

With that, I ended the call with Kuon.

<b>

It feels like a good part-time job just fell into my lap.

Thinking about that, I placed my smartphone on the desk and returned the cat I had been holding to the air's moisture.

<b>

"I need to make sure to finish my research and training before the forest school starts, just in case."

<b>

Saying that, I resumed my research on further applications of water magic.
