# Chapter 110: The Cultural Festival Has Begun 2

"Is that the 2-B classroom...?"

<b>

Second floor of the school building.

All the windows of the 2-B classroom are covered with black curtains, and on top of that, illustrations resembling jack-o'-lanterns and deformed ghosts are stuck to the curtains. At the entrance by the blackboard, a female student dressed in a ghost costume is standing at the reception.

At first glance, it looks like a reasonably well-made haunted house, similar to those seen in dramas or manga, but perhaps due to the festival effect, there is quite a line here, although not as long as for the hot dog stall.

<b>

"Wow, that was scary!"

"I was really surprised by that mechanism."

<b>

The students who came out generally gave positive feedback. It seems they have prepared quite a few elaborate tricks.

<b>

"Shall we line up for now?"

"Yeah. ...It's inappropriate, but I'm feeling a bit excited."

"…Actually, I'm kind of looking forward to it too."

<b>

Despite having encountered and fought real ghosts and vengeful spirits, I find myself excited about this haunted house.

I wait for our turn to come, surprised at my own feelings.

<b>

"Welcome to the 2-B hosted thrilling haunted house! Please write your class and last name on this roster!"

<b>

Probably dressed as a vampire, a female student with horns and fangs wearing a red cape smiles and speaks to us as our turn arrives.

Kyosato and I write our class and last names on the roster as instructed, but just as we try to enter...

<b>

"Ah, wait a minute!?"

<b>

The female student dressed as a vampire looks at the roster and hurriedly grabs Kyosato's arm to speak to her.

<b>

"Um, what is it?"

"Well, you’re a member of the Literary Club, right? Do you know where Ikoma-san is?"

"Ikoma-senpai, you mean?"

"Yes. She was supposed to be in charge of the ghosts for this haunted house, but we can't get in touch with her and we're in trouble. If you know anything, could you tell me?"

<b>

It seems that Ikoma-senpai was supposed to be in charge of this haunted house. And this female student appears to be troubled by the fact that she can't get in touch with Ikoma-senpai, who hasn't come to school.

<b>

"I'm sorry. I haven't been able to contact Ikoma-senpai either..."

"Oh, I see. Sorry for stopping you."

<b>

The female student gives a wry smile and moves away from us.

<b>

...From that reaction, it seems that only Kyosato and her friends had informed about their absence from the cultural festival.

If that's the case, what was the reason for informing only them about their absence? Why distinguish between classmates and Kyosato's group?

<b>

"Shuu-kun?"

"Ah, sorry. I was lost in thought. I'll be right there."

<b>

Called by Kyosato, I switch my thoughts and enter the haunted house.

<b>

"Wow..."

"Hey."

<b>

The classroom is dimly lit by candle-like lights, creating a mysterious atmosphere, and the structure is designed so that black curtains hanging from the ceiling lead to a single exit.

I see, this is indeed a haunted house.

As I walk along the path with such a mundane thought, I suddenly sense a presence nearby.

<b>

"BOO!!"

"Whoa!?"

<b>

A ghost covered with a white sheet, with holes for eyes and mouth, suddenly jumps out in front of us.

Startled, I instinctively shout, and the ghost seems to enjoy the surprise, disappearing behind the black curtain.

<b>

Wow, that was surprising.

Even a cheap-looking ghost costume can be startling when it suddenly appears in the dark.

As I think about this and look at Kyosato, she is completely still, just staring at where the ghost disappeared.

<b>

...Is she frozen in shock? So Kyosato is weak against this kind of jump scare too.

Thinking this, I was about to speak to reassure her, but―――.

<b>

"…Was that figure modeled after a Western ghost? No, but it seems similar to a new type reported in the Kinki region a few years ago... There must be some connection between the supernatural and the collective unconscious of people..."

<b>

It seems that was a grand misunderstanding on my part.

Kyosato was simply seriously analyzing the original source of the ghost costume like a professional.

<b>

"…Kyosato, let’s move ahead for now since we’re blocking the way."

"Ah, y-yeah. Sorry."

<b>

When I say that in a low voice, Kyosato suddenly comes to her senses and bows her head.

Well, I suppose there are different ways to enjoy this.

With that in mind, we head deeper into the haunted house.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Thank you! If you don't mind, please fill out the questionnaire!"

<b>

As we exit the 2-B classroom, a male student dressed as Frankenstein's monster smiles and hands us a questionnaire and a pen.

The questions include "Were you satisfied with this exhibit?" and "Which mechanism surprised you the most?"

I quickly fill out my answers: "I was very satisfied" and "The ghost that jumped out first surprised me the most."

<b>

"Once you're done, please put it in this box."

<b>

Just as I finish writing, the male student holds out a box decorated with a deformed ghost.

Following his instructions, I place the questionnaire inside and look at Kyosato.

<b>

"…I was surprised. …In this case, 'surprised' simply means I was startled, right? …So that means…"

<b>

Kyosato, who had been pondering the original sources of the mechanisms throughout the haunted house, seems to be struggling with how to answer the questionnaire.

Seeing this, I think, "This might take a while," and shift my attention to the other 2-B students around us.

I decide to eavesdrop on their conversations using the drones generated by my pre-prepared "Water Magic," equipped with sound detection capabilities.

<b>

"…Hey, we want to go to the mock stalls and food stands."

"…Since Ikoma isn't here, just hold on. I want to leave early too."

<b>

As expected, they seem to be somewhat panicking over Ikoma-senpai's sudden absence.

It's understandable that they would feel this way if someone scheduled to be in charge suddenly disappears without any notice, but...

<b>

"…I thought the cultural festival would be easy since it was all pushed onto Ikoma..."

"…Shh, it would be bad if others heard. There are underclassmen around."

"…But it's really tough. We had Ikoma do all the troublesome stuff."

<b>

...I’ve heard an unpleasant conversation.

It seems that the 2-B students treated Ikoma-senpai as a convenient errand runner.

And now that Ikoma-senpai has absent without notice, it appears some issues have arisen among them.

<b>

(The haunted house itself was fun, though...)

<b>

For now, I've learned what I wanted to know. Once Kyosato finishes the questionnaire, I’ll quickly leave this place.

As I think this, the student who had jumped out to scare us earlier in the haunted house appears.

The ghost removes its white suit, revealing a female student, and approaches the male student dressed as Frankenstein's monster.

<b>

"Hey! Are Kidera and the others here yet!? My shift is already over!"

"W-wait, Harada, don’t take it off here... By the way, Kidera and the others went in wearing costumes just a while ago."

"What!? They weren't anywhere to be found!"

<b>

It seems that the female student is angry because her replacement for the ghost role hasn't shown up.

However, according to the male student, those students had gone in wearing costumes.

<b>

Well, in that darkness, it wouldn’t be surprising to lose track of them.

<b>

"Um, I’m sorry. I finished the questionnaire..."

"Oh, sorry! Please put it in this box."

<b>

Just then, Kyosato, who had finished the questionnaire, approaches the male student, and he looks apologetic as he brings over the collection box.

The female student finally seems to notice us and, somewhat embarrassed, quietly says, "I’ll go look for them again," before heading back into the classroom.

<b>

Now, where should we go next? Just as I think about taking out the pamphlet――.

<b>

"Rumble rumble..."

"Yikes!?"

"W-what is that!?"

<b>

Suddenly, a loud dragging sound of something massive is heard, and at the same time, the entire school building shakes violently.

Thinking it might be an earthquake, I instinctively shield Kyosato while looking around.

<b>

"W-what the hell...! What’s happening...!?"

"W-what is this...!?"

"Shuu-kun... this is..."

"Ugh..."

<b>

Eventually, the gazes of the students turn towards what was presumably the haunted house...

<b>

An otherworldly space where public telephone booths, road signs, utility poles, train crossing signals, bookshelves, basketball hoops, slides, swings, and televisions are haphazardly fused together.

And a gate leading to that space appears, replacing the classroom.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

"Looks like we’ve been had..."

<b>

Alicia mutters in front of the school she attends, pondering what to do.

<b>

To prevent the outburst of Ikoma Juri's ability.

That’s why Alicia had been exploring the city with her subordinates to find her, but she hadn’t noticed the overwhelmingly large scale of this "anomaly" that had occurred because of it.

<b>

"This is Alicia-sama. It seems you have also noticed it."

<b>

In front of the pondering Alicia, the doll 【Ibara】 that Iori Shu has captured and modified appears.

<b>

"...You weren’t acting with him, were you?"

"Yes. I was instructed by my master to check on Ikoma-sama's condition."

"I see, so that’s how you managed to avoid getting caught up in this abnormal situation."

<b>

Iori Shu had said it was safe, but since it was an entity of unknown origin, I couldn't let my guard down.

Alicia maintains her vigilance while extracting information from Ibara and then shifts her gaze back to what lies before her.

<b>

――The school building she attends every day.

But that is merely a facade.

<b>

"…"

<b>

Alicia tries to enter the school building again, but at that moment, she is forcibly returned to the school gate.

<b>

"Replacing the school itself with an otherworldly space. Such a power, even my master wouldn’t be able to activate it."

"Oh, I feel like he could probably do something like this."

"Hehe, Alicia-sama holds your master in very high regard."

<b>

By throwing such light banter at Ibara, she regains her composure and begins to formulate a temporary response plan.

<b>

(First, we’ll seal off the surrounding area, and then proceed with memory manipulation and information alteration for those involved.)

<b>

Right now, all we can do is evacuate the residents and fabricate information.

This unknown otherworldly space――― it is likely a product of the outburst of Ikoma Juri's ability, and only Iori Shu, who has been left inside, can resolve it.

<b>

"Ibara, you will accompany me. Currently, your presence is the only way to determine whether he is alive inside the otherworldly space."

"Understood."

<b>

After informing Ibara, Alicia then instructs her subordinates to carry out concealment, fabrication, and isolation.

Wishing fervently for this great anomaly to end as soon as possible―――.
