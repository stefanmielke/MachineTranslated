# Episode 25: I Tried the Extra Skill 2

“...Is something wrong?”

<b>

As I stared at the 'Status', Kuon approached me with a worried expression.

<b>

“No, it’s nothing. More importantly, could you play around with 'Body Enhancement' a bit more?”

“? Understood.”

<b>

With that, Kuon began to use the skill 'Body Enhancement' again, trying various movements that wouldn't normally be possible.

Well then.

<b>

―――

<b>

Indeed, every time Kuon activates the 'Body Enhancement' skill, my MP is consumed.

Is this how it was designed, or is it because the concept of MP doesn't exist for anyone other than her, or rather, me?

<b>

“...Huh?”

<b>

While pondering this, Kuon suddenly stops moving.

<b>

“What’s wrong?”

“I can’t use 'Body Enhancement' anymore…”

“? Try it again.”

“Understood.”

<b>

Saying that, Kuon closes her eyes and tries to concentrate to activate the skill, but my MP does not decrease.

<b>

What’s going on? My MP hasn’t run out yet.

<b>

“Kuon, could you come back here for a moment?”

“Understood.”

<b>

I grant 'Body Enhancement' again to Kuon with 'Skill Lending'.

Then, the same light that enveloped her body when she first activated the skill appears again.

Confirming that, I activate 'Skill Lending' once more to attempt 'Body Enhancement'.

<b>

“Error. The effect of Skill Lending has already been activated.”

<b>

Then, a message I had seen somewhere before appeared on the translucent display.

<b>

“Is something wrong?”

“Sorry, could you stay still and activate 'Body Enhancement' as much as possible?”

“Um... okay!”

<b>

Not understanding the intent behind the instruction, Kuon activates the skill 'Body Enhancement' while looking puzzled.

This time, my MP begins to be consumed properly.

<b>

Gradually, my MP continues to be consumed, but...

<b>

“Ah!”

<b>

After a while, the decrease in MP stops.

Could it be that this extra skill has some sort of time limit?

<b>

“Such a nice story doesn’t exist, huh?”

“Did you figure something out?”

“Yeah, it seems like this has a time limit. Probably, 'Body Enhancement' can only be lent for about 15 minutes.”

“...Is that so?”

<b>

Then, next, I should check if this time limit is uniform.

Next, I lend 'Body Enhancement (Medium)', instructing Kuon to activate the skill continuously at the same spot while I monitor both her status and the newly purchased wristwatch.

<b>

“I can’t do it anymore. It’s stopped activating.”

<b>

This time, the decrease in MP stops in less than 10 minutes.

It seems that skills requiring a large amount of SP have shorter lending times.

<b>

Well then, I thought about the next verification, but it’s getting late. I should wrap it up soon.

Before that...

<b>

“Kuon, could you try to think of 'Status' just in case?”

“'Status', you say?”

“Yeah. Just think of it lightly.”

<b>

Kuon concentrates and begins to think of 'Status', but after a while, she shakes her head in resignation.

<b>

“...It’s no good. No matter how much I think of 'Status', nothing comes out.”

“I see.”

<b>

Responding like that, I activate 'Appraisal' targeting Kuon.

<b>

―――

<b>

Kuon Kyori  Human  16 years old

Condition: Healthy

Notes: None

<b>

―――

<b>

The information displayed by 'Appraisal' has no level or skills anywhere.

The main purpose of this extra skill verification was to confirm the idea that using skills might grant levels and statuses.

<b>

However, from the information gathered this time, it seems that levels, skills, and statuses can only be handled by me.

<b>

“It’s getting late, so let’s call it a day. I’ll take you to the station.”

“N-No, I can go home by myself.”

“No, no, I can’t let a girl go back alone from the mountains at this time of night. Besides, when I say I’ll take you, I just mean using 'Spatial Transfer Magic' to pop over quickly.”

“...Is that so? Then, thank you.”

<b>

When I said I would 'take her', Kuon showed a shy expression and hesitated, but as soon as I mentioned 'Spatial Transfer Magic', her expression turned disappointed.

Well, that’s fine.

<b>

“Then, just hold onto the hem of my clothes or something.”

“Understood.”

<b>

Now that I think about it, this is my first time 'Spatial Transferring' with someone, I thought as I activated the skill.

<b>

“'Spatial Transfer Magic'”

<b>

<b>

<b>

After a moment of darkness, the scenery before me changed from a dark mountain to a back alley of a bustling street where neon lights shone.

Next to me was Kuon, who had her eyes closed.

<b>

“Hey, we’ve arrived.”

“R-Really...?”

<b>

Opening her eyes cautiously, Kuon lets out a big sigh.

It’s really surprising, but being suddenly transferred to another place is quite scary...

<b>

“Do you know the way from here?”

“...Yes, I’m fine. Thank you for bringing me.”

“Sure. Well then, see you again—”

<b>

Just as I was about to part ways with Kuon, I noticed a girl from another school walking in the dark alley.

Huh, I feel like I’ve seen that girl somewhere...

<b>

“Excuse me. Could you please follow that girl with me?”

“Sure, but why?”

“I sensed an aura similar to youkai from that girl. She might be connected to the remnants of the Ushi-Oni, or perhaps another youkai.”

“Got it. Then let’s chase after her right away.”

“...Thank you.”

<b>

I cast 'Recognition Concealment Magic' on both myself and Kuon, then proceed into the alley where that girl disappeared.

<b>

“Did she go in here?”

“Probably.”

<b>

What lay ahead was a dilapidated three-story commercial building.

<b>

“The door isn’t open, is it...?”

“Then we just need to transfer again.”

<b>

I grabbed Kuon’s shoulder and activated 'Spatial Transfer Magic' to teleport inside the building.

<b>

“? Is something wrong?”

“...N-Nothing. More importantly, let’s hurry and chase after that girl!”

<b>

Saying that, Kuon left me behind and hurried deeper into the building.

I wondered what had suddenly come over her as I followed her.

<b>

<b>

The inside of the building was dark, with no lights on, and all the rooms were left open and covered in dust. There were simply too many rooms to search through.

I thought it would be a hassle to find her.

<b>

“Is this the room...?”

“Yeah, probably.”

<b>

As I pushed through the hallway, a faint light leaked out, revealing a closed door.

<b>

Now, will it be a demon or a snake?

I made eye contact with Kuon, wrapped my hands in a towel, and slowly and carefully opened the door.

<b>

<b>

“...What is this?”

<b>

Inside was a scene that could only be described as bizarre.

<b>

In the center of the sterile room was a sofa placed facing each other.

On it sat a total of 12 men and women with vacant expressions.

They did not utter a word, simply staring silently at the faces of the people across from them.

<b>

<b>

As I watched them, I finally recognized the source of the déjà vu I felt towards that girl.

<b>

No doubt about it. That girl is, without a doubt, the girlfriend of Rentaro, whom I had seen far too often.
