# Episode 43: The Forest School Has Started 4

"Ah, it's hot..."

<b>

Finally unable to endure it any longer, Rentaro, who was walking in front, let out such a voice and wiped the sweat from his forehead with a towel.

The other students walking around were also grimacing at the heat, drinking sports drinks or holding portable fans to their faces, trying to find some relief.

Unlike the city, there was no heat from asphalt, the air was fresh, and the trees overhead provided shade with a refreshing breeze blowing, so it was somewhat better, but still far hotter compared to a room with the air conditioning running full blast.

<b>

Everyone present shared the same thought: they wanted to quickly descend this mountain and bask in the cool air conditioning of the accommodation.

<b>

(Oh dear, it looks tough)

<b>

—Except for one person, me.

<b>

<b>

The schedule for the second day of the forest school was a mountain climb divided by groups.

On the first day, most of the morning was spent traveling, and the afternoon ended with a briefing on the schedule and safety checks for the following days, so the students initially felt light on their feet, thinking, "Finally, we can take a breather!" But by the time they reached the halfway point, everyone was already exhausted from the heat.

<b>

"…You seem pretty relaxed, Shu."

<b>

As I walked along the mountain path, observing them from a little behind, Alicia spoke to me with a narrowed gaze.

I matched my pace with Alicia, activated 'Cognitive Disruption Magic' to ensure our voices couldn’t be heard, and then replied.

<b>

"You seem to be struggling quite a bit. I thought you’d have undergone training to endure heat or cold."

"No matter how much training you do, you can't stop feeling hot or sweating... I mean..."

<b>

Alicia directed her gaze toward the clothes I was wearing.

I had heard that for this forest school, any clothing that allowed for easy movement was acceptable, so most students had prepared their own casual clothes to participate.

So I had also joined wearing something I bought from a thrift store, intending to dispose of it afterward...

<b>

"…Is this outfit really that strange?"

"Not that. Why haven't you sweated at all after walking in the mountains for about an hour? You're definitely doing something."

<b>

Uh-oh, she figured it out.

I thought I was hidden well enough not to be noticed.

...But if I've been found out, there's no point in trying to cover it up.

<b>

"Try sticking your finger in the hem of my jacket over there."

"Like this? Whoa, that's cold!?"

<b>

As I instructed, Alicia stuck her finger into the sleeve of my jacket.

She was surprised by the cold air that flowed out and quickly pulled her hand away.

<b>

"W-what is that?"

"I prepared a simple cooling system inside my clothes with various tricks. Thanks to this, I can handle the heat and sweat without any problem."

<b>

What I'm doing is extremely simple. I'm just generating ice with 'Ice Magic', finely crushing it, and circulating it inside my clothes with 'Wind Magic'.

Now that I've trained my arms with 'Water Magic' to create animals, this level of magic is a piece of cake for me.

<b>

"Is that one of those special abilities?"

"…Well, something like that."

<b>

I responded vaguely to Alicia's inquiry on purpose.

To be honest, I still don't fully trust her.

She seems to know that I possess some kind of special ability, so I won’t hide that, but I won’t tell her specifically what it is; that’s my current approach to dealing with Alicia.

<b>

"Hey, can you use that ability to make my clothes the same way? It's been a long time since I've experienced a Japanese summer, and I'm honestly struggling."

"Well, I could do it, but..."

"But?"

"To do that, you would need to... take everything off...?"

<b>

This simple cooling system needs to be set up before putting on the clothes.

I tried to see if I could apply it after putting them on, but it resulted in an uncomfortable feeling of having one part being extremely cold.

With various adjustments and practice, I might be able to do it while wearing clothes, but I can't do that right now.

<b>

"…Sigh, fine. I’ll just endure and keep walking."

<b>

Alicia's face turned slightly red at my words, but she quickly returned to her usual demeanor, sighed, and started walking toward the summit.

I was grateful that she didn’t press for more details about my abilities, as I didn't want to discuss them in detail.

However, not sweating at all is bound to raise some suspicions.

<b>

(…It can't be helped)

<b>

I canceled the simple cooling system with 'Dispel' and adjusted my pace to match the group members while sweating as we aimed for the summit.

<b>

After a while, we arrived at an open area.

In one corner of the plaza, there was a simple stall and a monument indicating the summit.

In other words, this is...

<b>

"Yes! We made it to the top..."

"I'm so tired..."

<b>

After three hours of climbing, the students finally reached the summit and one by one, they sat down on the ground.

<b>

"By the way, Shu, you’re not even out of breath at all."

"Well, I started doing some strength training a little while ago. Maybe that’s why."

"Hmm. Maybe I should start working part-time and go to the gym too."

<b>

As I exchanged such casual conversation with Rentaro, I noticed a reaction from the animal I had generated with 'Water Magic' that I had previously released into the mountain for surveillance, so I shared my perspective with him through 'Sensory Sharing'.

<b>

(This looks like it could be a hassle...)

<b>

The position is... yeah, it looks like I could get back in three minutes if I really put my mind to it.

<b>

"What's wrong?"

"Sorry. I need to go to the bathroom for a bit."

"Oh, okay."

<b>

After telling Rentaro that, I pretended to go to the bathroom and quickly dashed down the mountain slope.

<b>

To resolve the impending threat in an instant.
