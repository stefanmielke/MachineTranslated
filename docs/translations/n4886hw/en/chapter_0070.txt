# Episode 66: The Fate of One Who Admired a Hero

(……What!? Why did I do something like that……)

<b>

Suddenly, memories flash before my eyes like a revolving lantern. How did it come to this……?

<b>

(……Is it because I’m going to kill him now?)

<b>

Brainwashing that human and making him wear a hero suit…… would probably be meaningless.

He is a true ability user who can acquire powers on his own and master them.

When he was first attacked, I gave up on rescuing Red Riser and Rose Pink Baroness and focused on data collection to confirm whether he was a human I could control.

And the conclusion was that 'it is impossible to control him; if we come into contact again, I will have no choice but to kill him.'

<b>

(Heroes are just a facade now. I have to protect my kingdom……!)

<b>

The steam filling this room makes it hard to see, but I can still tell that he is lying there, unable to move.

<b>

In other words, if I stab this sword into his chest, I can definitely take him down.

<b>

Despite the steam obscuring most of my vision, I steadily take one step after another toward the figure lying down.

<b>

And just as I reach a position where I can surely stab the sword into his heart, I finally realize.

<b>

‘……An ice, doll?’

<b>

What I thought was him was actually a finely crafted ice doll.

<b>

‘……A decoy?’

<b>

Could it be that I, of all people, fell into his trap?

No, what I should be thinking about is……!

<b>

‘Where is he!? Where did he go!?’

<b>

I turn on all the detection functions on my goggles and desperately search for the vanished enemy.

The possibility that he has already escaped can be excluded for now.

If he has the ability to teleport freely, he could escape without needing such a distraction.

<b>

However, I am unable to find any trace of the enemy, and I gradually lose my composure.

<b>

(Really, where did he run off to……!?)

<b>

Should I just attack in all directions, 360 degrees, and try to flush him out?

But if I do that―――.

<b>

At that moment, I feel something stab into my left shoulder, and unable to withstand the weight, I am pushed down to the ground.

<b>

(……What is it? What just happened now?)

<b>

Struggling to muster my strength, I look at my left shoulder and see that something resembling crab pincers has crushed the parts of my suit, destroying the original decorations and armor.

<b>

Not understanding what has happened, I momentarily stop thinking.

<b>

And that was more than enough time for the enemy to launch an attack.

<b>

“Haah!”

<b>

The device embedded in my left shoulder begins to rotate, as if winding something up.

Almost simultaneously, I finally sense the enemy's intent.

<b>

(The skill activation――is it too late!?)

<b>

The enemy swings down the ice knives in his hands with blinding speed, repeatedly striking and causing sparks to fly as he begins to strip away the armor of my suit.

I don’t know how he is preventing that ice from melting, but there’s no time to ponder that.

<b>

At this rate, the armor of my suit will undoubtedly be stripped away, and I will be forced to confront this monster in my bare flesh.

<b>

――It’s a bitter decision, but it can’t be helped.

I activate the self-destruct function I had pre-installed in the suit, and thanks to the instant detachment mechanism, the suit successfully escapes from the enemy.

<b>

And just at the moment I escape the explosion range, the suit explodes with a loud noise.

<b>

“It’s over, right?”

<b>

I can’t help but mutter that to myself.

In the final moment of the explosion, I saw a figure straddling the suit.

Unless something extraordinary happened, the enemy would likely have been caught up in that explosion.

<b>

“Haah, haah,…… damn it.”

<b>

More than the fact that I killed someone, I feel irritated at myself for thinking that I managed to escape this predicament and decide to head to my room, located directly below the command room.

<b>

To check whether that crystal, which is crucial for maintaining the hero suit and base of this super rescue squad, is safe.

<b>

“――Oh, so that crystal is what allows such a massive thing to float and is the source of that ridiculous suit’s specs?”

<b>

At that moment, I hear a voice from behind that I shouldn’t have heard, or rather, a voice that shouldn’t be audible at all.

<b>

“Wha, ah……”

<b>

<b>

Standing there was undoubtedly him.

Despite being close enough to be hit by the blast, his body is unscathed, and his eyes shine like a beast that has found its prey.

<b>

“Ugh!?”

<b>

And in the next moment, I feel a shock hit me, and in an instant, my consciousness is snatched away.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

“‘Appraisal’”

<b>

――――

<b>

Kato Seigi, 14(16) years old, human, level n/a

Status: unconscious

Note: He was ambushed from behind while trying to check the condition of the crystal by heading to his room, which also serves as a storage room, located beneath the command room.

<b>

――――

<b>

Finally able to use the skill ‘Appraisal,’ I confirm that the so-called hero, Kato Seigi, is unconscious and stretch my body widely.

It was a gamble to try the ice doll decoy strategy, but I never expected it to be this effective.

Well, it seems that trying things out is always worth it.

<b>

“Now then”

<b>

I descend to his private room and storage area located beneath the pedestal he was heading toward.

<b>

“The interior of the room doesn’t seem much different from other heroes’ rooms.”

<b>

His private room is similar to the one I saw through the doll earlier, containing only the essentials for living, like a bathroom, toilet, dresser, desk, and refrigerator.

The only difference is that there is another room further back.

<b>

“Hmm?”

<b>

Eagerly, I grasp the doorknob to open the door to that room, but it doesn’t budge at all.

Upon closer inspection, I notice a keyhole on the doorknob.

<b>

To have a lock inside a room that is already isolated from the outside means there is definitely something he wanted to protect at all costs inside this room.

<b>

“Haah!”

<b>

With this, there’s no need to use body enhancement.

I kick the door down with sheer force and step inside with my shoes on.

<b>

The room designated as the storage area is dimly lit, yet it has an air of sanctity about it.

And in the center of the room, there floats a palm-sized jade-green crystal.

<b>

“‘Appraisal’”

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Ikai Crystal

Status: Good

Note: Extracts magical power from another world and compensates for the MP needed for the owner’s skill activation.

Additionally, if the crystal is lost, the original owner will be unable to activate skills, and all previously activated skills will lose their effectiveness.

Current owner: Kato Seigi.

<b>

――――

<b>

So this is the whole mechanism behind it.

Now that I understand the trick, there’s no reason to leave this here. I should destroy it or store it in my item box as soon as possible.

<b>

“Whoa!”

<b>

A loud explosion echoes, and this aerial fortress tilts significantly.

<b>

“First, I need to figure out how to safely land this big thing.”

<b>

I activate ‘Shared Senses’ and focus on safely landing it in an unpopulated area by shooting a cable from the ‘Water Magic’ drone I had previously stationed above the aerial fortress.
