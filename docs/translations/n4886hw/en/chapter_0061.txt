# Episode 57: I Learned About Urban Legends 4

“...Um, are you okay?”

<b>

In a deserted alley a little distance from the scene of the encounter with the hero, I gently shook the bodies of the boys I had put to sleep to wake them up.

<b>

“W-what... where are we?”

“Why are we lying on the ground...?”

<b>

The boys all reacted the same way, confused about the situation they were in.

<b>

(...I should check just to be safe)

<b>

I targeted the silver-haired boy who had attacked the pink hero suit and activated the skill "Identification."

<b>

―――

<b>

Yokoi Naruharu, Human, 16 years old

Condition: Confused memory and consciousness, mild nausea and headache

Notes: Due to having undergone memory alteration and brainwashing (to make him commit extortion against specific targets), his physical condition is poor.

■■ First-year high school student. During summer vacation, he dyed his hair with friends on a whim.

He plans to return his hair color soon, citing embarrassment and the approaching new semester.

No history of being taken into custody.

<b>

――――

<b>

Considering the information displayed by the identification and the fact that the school they attend has relatively strict rules, they are likely just ordinary students playing at being delinquents during summer vacation.

And the most important part is the "memory alteration and mental manipulation."

<b>

“I’ve called an ambulance, so please wait here for now.”

“Ah, thank you. By the way, do you know why we were lying here?”

“---No, I just found you collapsed on my way to go shopping and called 119.”

“...I see. ...Damn it, I can remember up until we left the karaoke.”

<b>

While we were talking, several ambulances arrived, and numerous paramedics got out.

<b>

“We received a report that someone was collapsed—”

“Over here!”

<b>

As I waved my hand, the paramedics quickly loaded the boys onto stretchers and took them to the ambulance.

<b>

They are agents from the organization that Alicia belongs to, disguised as paramedics, and they seem to be conducting tests and "information gathering" on those boys at a hospital owned by a front company.

However, judging by that identification result, it’s likely that very little useful information will come out.

<b>

(Then the next target to investigate is...)

<b>

I used "Tracking and Detection Magic" to check the location of the "Water Magic" tracking device attached to that hero suit.

I thought it would probably indicate some deserted place like an abandoned house in the suburbs or deep in the mountains...

<b>

“...Huh?”

<b>

The location information of the tracking device displayed, and seeing the content of the letter that the hero suit had handed to the boy made me involuntarily let out a foolish voice.

The reason for my reaction was that the tracking device attached to the pink hero suit was stationary at an astonishing altitude of 20,000 meters, far above the cruising altitude of a passenger plane.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Welcome back, big brother.”

<b>

After finishing shopping at the supermarket and returning home, Kana was waiting for me at the entrance with her arms crossed and a big smile on her face.

<b>

“It doesn’t even take 10 minutes to get to that supermarket, right? So why were you gone for an hour?”

<b>

Ah, I expected it, but she’s really furious.

<b>

“...A lot happened. Also, here, please put this in the freezer quickly.”

<b>

Saying that, I took out the soy sauce, vinegar, and a set of red-lidded ice cream that’s quite pricey for a high school student, which I had been asked to buy, and handed it to Kana.

<b>

“Wait, are you serious!? You really bought it for me!?”

“Leave one strawberry. You can eat the rest.”

“Okay!”

<b>

“Such a cash-driven kid,” I thought, watching Kana run happily into the kitchen, and I returned to my room.

For now, that should have cheered my little sister up.

<b>

“Phew...”

<b>

Sitting on the bed, I took a sip of the sports drink I retrieved from the "Item Box" and then tried to contact someone on my smartphone.

<b>

“Hello? Is now a good time? I have something I want to ask you...”

“Yeah, it’s fine. I actually have a few things I want to ask you too.”

<b>

Alicia’s voice on the phone sounded somewhat angry.

<b>

“I’ll get straight to the point. Are you planning to get involved in this incident?”

“...I probably wouldn’t have gotten involved if I hadn’t actually seen that hero suit. Maybe.”

“So now that you’ve witnessed the incident, you’re fully intending to get involved, huh?”

<b>

With that, Alicia sighed as if exasperated.

<b>

“...I suppose even if I told you to stop, you wouldn’t. We don’t have the power to stop you either. Plus, it’s true that we haven’t gathered much information about that group in the hero suits, and we’re in a situation where we could use all the help we can get.”

“Does that mean—”

“I’ll share the investigation status. However, don’t even think about switching sides with those guys.”

<b>

After saying that, Alicia sighed again in exasperation.

For now, I could consider this the first hurdle cleared.

Then, without hesitation, I would throw my questions at her.

<b>

“First, what’s the situation with those guys who were taken away by the ambulance?”

“They’re feeling mild nausea and headaches, but they’re otherwise perfectly healthy. However, I’m worried about the temporary memory loss.”

<b>

That was something I already knew from the identification result, so it wasn’t a huge surprise.

<b>

“...What period of memory is lost due to that [memory loss]?”

“They seem to have lost their memories from about two hours ago, starting from when they left the karaoke in front of the station. We’ve also confirmed via nearby security cameras that they left that location around that time.”

<b>

Yeah, that aligns with what they had muttered.

Now the question is.

<b>

“Do you know what they did after that?”

“Of course. They headed straight to the so-called [extortion scene] as if they were under hypnosis.”

“Did they have any prior acquaintance with the person they were extorting or anything?”

“No, not at all. Neither side had any prior acquaintance or connection.”

<b>

Then the possible scenario is―――.

<b>

“Is it possible that all of this is a match-pump by that group in the hero suits?”

“It’s very possible. In fact, we’re currently investigating that possibility.”

“What do you mean?”

“Recently, there have been about 15 incidents of extortion and attempted rape occurring daily in deserted areas among young people, and all of them have been suppressed by suspicious individuals in hero suits. Furthermore, there are traces of short-term memory loss or hypnosis on the perpetrators, and some of them have no prior acquaintance with the victims, who have all gone missing after the incidents, which is quite suspicious, right?”

<b>

Fifteen incidents that are unlikely to occur in peaceful Japan happening in a single day, all resolved by a group in hero suits. It’s certainly not something that can be brushed off as coincidence.

However, considering the behavior of that tracking device, is it possible that actual incidents are occurring and they are being dispatched to the scene?

But if the perpetrators were in a hypnotic state, there might indeed be something behind it.

<b>

“I know it’s a late question, and you’ve probably already tried this, but were you able to track the devices that posted the videos?”

“No. The sources all seemed to be from nonsensical locations, and when they actually went to investigate, they found nothing that resembled anything.”

<b>

So it really is a dead end.

Then.

<b>

“If we can’t figure it out, we’ll have to go directly to hear what they have to say.”

“Going to hear them out sounds easy, but if it were that simple—”

“Well, well, I’ve already thought of a way to storm their hideout.”

<b>

After saying that, I sent the outline of the infiltration operation and the contents of that letter to Alicia via a messaging app.

<b>

“...Alright. I’ll go along with your gamble.”

<b>

Upon hearing the details, she first looked puzzled, then sighed, and finally accepted my proposal with exasperation.

<b>

“So when do we carry this out?”

“Tomorrow at 3 AM. It’s better to get this done early.”

“Understood. I’ll gather the equipment, so you also work to increase the chances of success for the operation.”

“Sure, sure.”

<b>

After that exchange, I ended the call with Alicia.

<b>

“Well then, let’s do what we can.”

<b>

So I conjured a water sphere with "Water Magic" and began creating a doll that closely resembled the boy who had been extorted.
