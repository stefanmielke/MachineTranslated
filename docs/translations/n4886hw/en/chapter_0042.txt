# Episode 39: I Made Them Pay the Price 3

"…So, that's the general flow of this incident."

<b>

After school.

In the second school building, which also serves as the clubroom, I sat in seiza on the tatami mats while explaining the incident to Kuon.

<b>

"I understand most of it. We will conduct a detailed investigation regarding the 'Nine-Tails' and seal it afterward, so don't worry."

<b>

After listening to my explanation, Kuon sipped her green tea from a cup and replied in a somewhat cold tone.

<b>

"Um, Kuon-san? Are you perhaps angry?"

"I'm not angry. I'm just concerned about the fact that you suddenly charged into enemy territory without any consultation and then informed me afterward."

<b>

Ah, she's genuinely angry.

<b>

"Well, um... I'm really sorry."

"When I received a sudden call in the middle of the night saying, 'I defeated Nagamoto, but he wasn't the mastermind,' I was truly surprised."

"Yes, I truly regret it..."

<b>

I continued to apologize, bowing my head deeply.

I had suddenly charged into a yakuza hideout in the middle of the night and got them to cooperate with just an explanation that "the real mastermind behind the series of incidents is someone else."

Even for the mild-mannered Kuon, it's understandable to feel anger over such actions.

So, I decided to honestly accept my fault.

<b>

"From now on, please at least inform someone before doing anything dangerous. I know that Iori-kun is stronger than anyone else, but that's a separate matter."

"Yes! I will make sure to inform you in advance from now on!"

"…I understand. I will trust your words."

<b>

Seeing Kuon smile gently as usual, I let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"Now that I have a general grasp of the incident, what about the follow-up?"

"Oh, that is—"

"It's a simple story. He and our organization worked overnight to alter the memories and records of those involved."

<b>

Before I could answer the question, the door to the clubroom opened, and Alicia entered.

<b>

"…Did you also call Alicia-san?"

"It would be impossible to explain this incident without me. You know that, Kyosato."

"Um…"

<b>

Feeling the tense atmosphere between Kuon and Alicia, I opened my mouth to change the subject.

<b>

"Well, Alicia is right. We had her organization help us completely alter the memories and records."

<b>

The reason Rintaro and the others had taken a leave of absence was that they had been turned into shells by that glass bottle.

Alicia sensed something was off with the changes happening to Rintaro and the others and gathered the similarly affected boys and girls at the front hospital run by her organization.

Thanks to that, the recovery with the victims' 'healing magic' and the alteration of memories and tracking of the involved parties went quite smoothly.

The subsequent record alterations were also handled by Alicia and her team, convincing the victims that they had been in a bus accident and had temporarily lost consciousness.

As for the relationships, they were made to believe they had met in a closed dating chat and started dating, ensuring they couldn't recall anything that happened at the Yamato Association.

The breakup rush after the dating rush was honestly unexpected, but well, it was probably just a matter of not being meant to be.

And by making them believe that those who were at that middle school were also involved in the accident, the issue was resolved.

Well, I did make some adjustments to the memories of those from the Yamato Association and the three bullies who tormented Kana and Seina, as well as the neglectful teachers and parents.

<b>

"So, the only ones who know the details of this incident are the three of us here."

"That's fine, but…"

<b>

Kuon shot a side-eye at Alicia.

<b>

"Oh? Are you dissatisfied that I know the secret, Lady Kuon?"

"That's not the case, but… is it really okay for you to reveal your identity to me and Iori-kun?"

"It's not good, but it's within the expected range, so it's not a problem. Especially if the opponent has an abnormal ability that defies common sense."

<b>

Saying that, Alicia turned to look at me.

Well, if we've been involved this much, it's probably obvious that I have the ability to know the secrets of others.

Oh, right.

<b>

"I just want to confirm, but your organization doesn't intend to harm me or my family, right?"

"As long as you don't expose me or get involved in any crimes."

"…I understand. I will trust your words."

<b>

As we were discussing this, the school dismissal bell rang from the hallway.

<b>

"Well then, I suppose we can wrap this up for today."

"Yes. Well then, Iori-kun, Kyosato-chan, see you tomorrow."

<b>

Alicia waved lightly and left the clubroom.

Well then, I guess I'll head home too. As I thought about standing up…

<b>

"…Let me confirm once more, was 'Nine-Tails' really trying to revive the 'Hyakki Yako'?"

"Eh? Ah, yes, that's true…"

"…I see. I'm sorry for taking up your time. I'll take care of the key, so please go ahead."

"Y-yeah."

<b>

As I felt a tug at my heart from Kuon's worried expression, I decided to hurry home for my duty.

<b>

――side Kuon Main House

<b>

<b>

"Damn it, why!? Why did it fail!?"

<b>

That day, Kuon Genji was in a furious rage.

<b>

The plan he had envisioned, "To partially unseal the Nine-Tails and release part of its tail to revive the Hyakki Yako, and by pacifying it, elevate his own status," had hit a snag because the crucial tail had been captured.

<b>

Even though he had taken risks to manipulate the tail and release it into that town, the result was that one of the Nine-Tails' fragments had fallen into the hands of that detestable Kyosato, so it was only natural for Genji to be furious.

<b>

"This is all Kyosato and that man's fault…!"

<b>

If it weren't for that man who was always clinging to Kyosato, the plan would have succeeded, and he could have solidified his position as the next head of the family as the man who pacified the Hyakki Yako.

<b>

"Please calm down, Genji-sama."

"…Is that you, Ibara?"

<b>

To soothe the raging Genji, a girl gently embraced him from behind.

<b>

"This does not mean that the plan has completely failed. There is still potential left for you, Genji-sama."

"Ah, yes, that's right…"

<b>

Embraced by the girl named Ibara and inhaling her fragrant scent, Genji regained his composure.

<b>

"Rest assured. I, Ibara, will surely present you with the head of the Kuon family. So please take a little rest for now."

"…Ah, I will do so."

<b>

Saying that, Genji fell asleep on Ibara's lap.

Seeing that, the girl smiled a twisted smile while stroking Genji's head.

<b>

Her appearance was like a frog ensnared by a snake.
