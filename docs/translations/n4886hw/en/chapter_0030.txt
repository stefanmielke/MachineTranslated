# Episode 27: I Reunited with the Transfer Student with Blonde Hair

"Early yesterday morning, in ■■ City, two suspects, Tomoaki Sugawara and Eiji Kanda, from the designated organized crime group, the Sando-kai, were arrested on suspicion of violating the Firearms and Swords Control Law following a report from nearby residents. Both suspects responded to the interrogation..."

<b>

"Another violent incident has occurred. Shu, you should be careful too."

"I know."

<b>

The next day, while having such a conversation with my father, who rarely came home, I was having a simple breakfast of toast with leftover minestrone I made last night.

He probably doesn't even consider that the central figures of this incident are right in front of him.

Thinking about that, I bit into my buttered toast.

<b>

"By the way, how's Kana?"

"She said she's feeling unwell and will sleep a bit longer. She seems to intend to go to school, though."

"Did she catch a cold?"

"She checked her temperature, and it was normal. I think she's just tired."

<b>

As we were having such inconsequential conversation, I realized it was about time to leave the house.

Normally, I would wash the dishes myself, but when my father is home, I leave the household chores to him; that's been our family's rule for a long time.

<b>

<b>

"Thanks for the meal. Well, I'm off."

"Yeah, take care."

<b>

After placing the dishes on the counter, I picked up the bag I had set near the living room door and left the house.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After that, we restrained the yakuza and cast 'Healing Magic' on the unconscious students, then escaped outside the office using 'Spatial Transfer Magic' and reported to the police that we heard gunfire.

Before long, a patrol car arrived in response to the report, and two restrained yakuza and twelve unconscious students were discovered. After a brief questioning, we were allowed to return home.

There shouldn't be any fingerprints left, and the office door was locked. Besides, our appearance could easily be mistaken for ordinary runners, so the police didn't seem to suspect us of anything shady.

In any case, after that, I parted ways with Kuon and arrived home around 8 o'clock.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The police are probably conducting various investigations into this baffling incident right now, but they likely won't find any clues.

The two suspects arrested in the incident seemed to have been told nothing about what had happened there, and the most crucial piece of evidence, that glass bottle, had been destroyed.

Even if it hadn't been destroyed, the outcome would have been the same.

After all, it was imbued with something unscientific like magic.

And above all, the yakuza only saw the figure of the person who had restrained them as a monster that made noise.

So the police probably haven't found any leads to solve the case.

<b>

(By the way, what was that level-up yesterday?)

<b>

Recalling the question I had put off yesterday, I opened my 'Status'.

―――

<b>

In yesterday's battle, I almost got hit by gunfire because my MP was depleted.

At that moment, when Kuon used 'Body Enhancement', the skill level reached 10, and I was able to escape the crisis by leveling up with the experience gained from that.

<b>

(It’s impossible for the skill level to reach 10 in that situation...)

<b>

I had certainly conducted various tests regarding skill acquisition, and the skill levels had increased somewhat.

However, I hadn't used the skills enough to reach the maximum value.

So what could be considered is...

<b>

(Was the experience gained from Kuon's skill activation actually added to my own?)

<b>

The verification I conducted last night was also to test the hypothesis that if I had Kuon use the skill through 'Skill Lending', I could gain experience and level up or acquire stats.

However, the result was that even when using the skills lent through 'Skill Lending', I didn't gain any experience or stats, which was quite ambiguous. But perhaps that experience was added to me instead of Kuon.

This needs further verification.

<b>

"Oops."

<b>

While I was thinking about that, I arrived at the classroom.

<b>

"Good morning."

"Yeah, good morning."

<b>

I greeted acquaintances as I headed to my seat.

As for Kuon, she was chatting with her close female friend about makeup and summer clothes in the seat next to me.

<b>

Then I noticed that a familiar friend was missing from the seat in front of me.

Given yesterday's incident, something might have happened. Thinking that, I approached another male friend.

<b>

"Hey, has Rentaro not come yet?"

"Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him today. Knowing him, he’s probably caught a cold and is sleeping it off, right? More importantly, I heard a transfer student is coming to our class! And she's supposed to be super beautiful!"

<b>

He started talking with a delighted expression.

A transfer student... probably referring to Alicia.

<b>

"Huh? You're not that surprised."

"Yeah, because yesterday—"

<b>

At that moment, the chime signaling the start of homeroom rang.

<b>

"Everyone, please take your seats. We will begin homeroom now."

<b>

As instructed by Teacher Koshimizu, the students returned to their seats.

...? There seem to be quite a few absentees today?

<b>

"Um, as some of you may know, we have a transfer student coming to this class. Please come in."

<b>

Prompted by the teacher, a beautiful girl with straight blonde hair entered the classroom, and some of the male students began to get excited.

The girl, seemingly unfazed by the students' reactions, stood at the podium with a cheerful smile.

<b>

"Hello everyone, nice to meet you. I'm Alicia Kamori."
