# Episode 58: I Learned About Urban Legends 5

"Thank you for coming, young man."

<b>

In the dead of night, at an abandoned factory on the outskirts of town, the pink hero suit called out to the boy he had saved just a few hours earlier, seemingly pleased.

<b>

"Since you've come here, it means you've made up your mind."

"Yes. I want to be a hero like you!"

<b>

The hero suit nodded in satisfaction and extended his right hand.

<b>

"Then take my hand. I will invite you to our base."

"Yes!"

<b>

As the boy responded cheerfully, their bodies dashed through the night sky like a flash of light, quickly moving to a massive object hovering at an altitude of 20,000 meters.

<b>

"Welcome. To our base, the [Base]."

<b>

What lay there was a secret base housing a giant mech resembling a Tyrannosaurus, something that could appear in a Sunday morning tokusatsu show.

<b>

Everyone moving within the facility was wearing hero suits, making it impossible to discern their faces or genders.

<b>

"Then first... let's conduct a test to check your suitability."

"A test?"

"Yes. The hero suits we wear are all custom-made based on each individual's personality and suitability."

<b>

Saying this, the one in the pink hero suit showed the armor he was wearing to the boy.

<b>

"...How do you determine that suitability?"

"Just a simple injection. After that, the commander will create a hero suit just for you based on the diagnosis results."

"An injection...?"

"You don't need to be scared. Come this way."

<b>

The boy, showing signs of fear, nevertheless wore a determined expression and followed the pink hero suit.

<b>

<b>

"[White], I would like to request the new recruit's examination."

"Understood. I'm on my way."

<b>

Stopping in front of a door adorned with an emblem featuring a fist and a syringe, the pink hero suit raised his voice slightly.

Then, a voice of indeterminate gender came from the installed speaker, and at the same time, the door opened heavily.

<b>

Beyond that door was a well-equipped medical room filled with expensive medical instruments such as surgical tables and MRIs.

<b>

"So you are the rumored new recruit."

<b>

As the boy gazed at these with interest, suddenly the same voice he had heard from the ceiling speaker echoed through the room.

<b>

When the boy looked up, he saw a figure in a white hero suit slowly descending while jetting from its back.

<b>

"Let me introduce you. This is White, also known as [Doctor The White], our medical officer in the [Super Rescue Squadron The Hero]. He may be a bit eccentric, but he's harmless, so don't worry."

"That's a terrible introduction, [Rose Pink Baroness]."

<b>

Equipped with jets on his back and clad in a white hero suit, the one who called himself [Doctor The White] exchanged what was likely a familiar banter with the pink hero suit—[Rose Pink Baroness]—before turning his gaze to the boy.

<b>

"You've heard the story from Rose, right? Now, place your arm on that table."

"Understood."

"It might hurt a little, but if you've resolved to become a hero, you can endure it, right?"

"Of course!"

<b>

Following the instructions, the boy placed his arm on the pedestal, and White took out a syringe to draw what appeared to be blood from the boy.

<b>

"Alright, the examination is complete. You did well."

<b>

White said this while gently patting the boy's head.

<b>

"Now, Rose, I leave the rest to you."

"I understand. Now, boy, please follow me."

"Ah, yes!"

<b>

Before leaving the room, the boy bowed to White and followed Rose.

<b>

"Um, I have a lot of questions I want to ask... is that alright?"

"We are comrades. If you have any concerns, feel free to ask away."

"First of all, how many heroes are there here?"

"About 300, give or take. Everyone is fighting against evil day and night."

"300... that's an incredible number. Do all those people live here?"

"Yes. We never know when or where a situation requiring heroes will arise."

"I see... That's why it was written in the letter that I had to leave home."

"Exactly. Oh, we've arrived."

<b>

At the place where Rose stopped, there was a door the same size as a typical entrance.

<b>

"Now, from today, this will be your new home."

<b>

The room's layout was essentially the same as a standard one-room apartment, equipped with a bathroom, toilet, wardrobe, desk, and refrigerator, providing most of the necessities for living.

At first glance, it looked like an ordinary apartment, but there was one clearly unusual feature.

<b>

"Um, what is this...?"

<b>

The boy pointed anxiously at a wall that had been entirely turned into a monitor.

<b>

"That is a monitor displaying orders from the commander."

"Commander?"

"Oh, I haven't explained yet. The commander is a hero who returned from another world and single-handedly established this Super Rescue Squadron. He's a remarkable person."

"Single-handedly... Um, Rose, have you met the commander?"

"I have... though it was only once."

"You've met the commander!? What was it like at that time—"

"I'm sorry, but I can't discuss what happened then."

<b>

Saying this, Rose turned on her heel.

...It seems there’s no more information I can extract from this person through ordinary means.

<b>

"Anyway, you must be tired today. Your hero suit should be ready by tomorrow afternoon, so take your time to rest until then—?"

"Yes. I understand."

<b>

As I focused my consciousness, the boy's body burst into a blue liquid, covering the entire room in slime.

<b>

"What... what is this...!?"

<b>

The one in the hero suit, calling himself Rose Pink Baroness, struggled desperately to break free from the slime's restraints, but his body showed no signs of movement whatsoever.

Well, it seems I can proceed without any issues.

<b>

"Alright, I can go now."

"Um, is this really okay? What if I end up fusing with a fly during the transfer—"

"Don't worry. That has never happened before. Now, let's go."

<b>

I cut off the "Shared Senses," used a doll created with "Water Magic" as a marker, and activated the skill "Spatial Transfer Magic."

<b>

"Who are you!? And where did you come from—"

<b>

As I appeared while activating "Recognition Inhibition Magic," Rose Pink Baroness showed a confused expression.

<b>

"Ah, sorry for barging in. I'm someone from the homeland, but could we have a little chat?" 

<b>

I spoke to him or her with the best fake smile I could muster.
