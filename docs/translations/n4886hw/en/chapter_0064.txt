# Episode 60: I Ended Up Fighting a Hero 2

"Did you not know? Growing in size is a sign of defeat, you know?"

'You bastard! Are you mocking me, the one who has been bestowed the glorious red name of 【Red Riser】 by the brave hero, and my 【God Tyranno】!?'

<b>

It seems that the creature named God Tyranno has quite good hearing.

The giant red dinosaur-shaped mech lets out a roar of rage and opens its massive mouth to try to crush me.

<b>

(‘Ice Magic’)

<b>

In response, I generate ice pillars with ‘Ice Magic’ to prevent the mouth of this so-called God Tyranno from closing.

<b>

'That’s useless!?!'

<b>

The red dinosaur-shaped mech releases scorching flames from its mouth, melting the ice pillars and trying to turn me literally to ash by increasing the heat.

<b>

Then.

<b>

'Guh!?'

<b>

I generate an ice sword mace and swing it vigorously at the mech's lower jaw.

The head of the dinosaur-shaped mech tilts upward from the impact, and at the same time, the remaining ice pillar that had not yet melted falls toward the flame thrower inside its mouth, destroying it.

<b>

'Oh no――'

<b>

Fortunately, that ice pillar seems to have fallen into a bad spot for the dinosaur-shaped mech.

<b>

【Gyaooooo!!?】

<b>

Sparks erupt from the gaps in the deep crimson armor of the mech, and lightning tears through the internal parts, releasing them outside.

<b>

With a death-like roar, the head of the dinosaur-shaped mech is blown to smithereens.

<b>

"Wow, so you were piloting it from there."

'Shit!'

<b>

As I maneuver the flyboard closer to the dinosaur-shaped mech, I can faintly see the figure in a red hero suit gripping the control stick in the now-exposed torso without a head.

The depth is... just over 10 meters.

At this rate, if I put a little force into it, I might be able to drag them out.

<b>

'You think I’m done just because my head got crushed!?!'

"Whoa."

<b>

The red hero suit violently moves the control stick, trying to shake me off the dinosaur-shaped mech.

<b>

(Tch, it can't be helped)

<b>

I jump back onto the flyboard, just as the beam cannon mounted on the dinosaur-shaped mech's wings scorches the spot where I had been.

<b>

'Wooooo!!!'

<b>

I can confidently say that the dinosaur-shaped mech is now in a state of rampage.

It starts firing its beam cannons and small missiles from both arms, legs, and wings in all directions, trying to take me down.

<b>

Now, what should I do?

It wouldn’t be impossible to drag this out into a war of attrition, but if I keep making a ruckus like this, reinforcements might come rushing in from the base.

Also, there’s a possibility that the energy of that dinosaur-shaped mech is inexhaustible and that its ammunition is being automatically replenished via teleportation.

<b>

"…Thinking about this won’t help."

<b>

I generate multiple flyboards using the skill ‘Ice Magic’ as shields, place them in front of me, and then rush into the mech’s space.

<b>

"Ugh, that took quite a bit…"

<b>

As expected, even though the dinosaur-shaped mech is just firing randomly without aiming, it managed to destroy several of my flyboard shields.

But with this, I should have the means to silence this rampaging beast.

<b>

"‘Water Magic’!"

<b>

I activate the skill ‘Water Magic’ and wrap a slime-like liquid around the legs of the dinosaur-shaped mech like a whip.

<b>

"…Phew, at least I managed to wrap it well."

<b>

Then I activate ‘Wind Magic’ to gain rotational power and whip the slime around with all my might.

Eventually, the dinosaur-shaped mech starts spinning rapidly, making a whooshing sound, and the firing of the beam cannons and missiles begins to taper off.

<b>

'Stop――'

"Here we go!!!"

<b>

I adjust my aim to collide directly above that slime room and release the slime whip wrapped around the dinosaur-shaped mech.

<b>

The dinosaur-shaped mech crashes into the aerial fortress, falling while making a sound of metal clashing against metal.

<b>

'Hii, hiiii!!?'

<b>

Where did that brave spirit go? I can hear the pathetic scream of the red hero suit that called itself Red Riser.

<b>

"Don’t worry. I won’t let you fall."

<b>

I manipulate the slime in the slime room to brace for the dinosaur-shaped mech as it crashes into the wall of the room.

<b>

Then I peek into the cockpit of the torso where the head of the dinosaur-shaped mech used to be, and there lies the red hero suit, seemingly unconscious.

<b>

"…No signs of reinforcements?"

<b>

Then this must be the right time.

I drag the red hero suit out of the dinosaur-shaped mech and use ‘Spatial Transfer Magic’ to transfer the other four hero suits that are either unconscious or restrained in that slime room to Safe House No. 6.

Finally, I store the half-destroyed dinosaur-shaped mech—this so-called 【God Tyranno】—in my item box and escape from the aerial fortress.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Welcome back. You certainly made quite a scene."

<b>

Upon entering Safe House No. 6, Alicia says to me while looking at the hero suits bound in slime, which are in tatters.

<b>

"…Well, I think I might have gone a bit overboard. By the way, did anything happen on the ground while I was causing explosions up there?"

"Don’t worry. It’s been raining outside, so I doubt anyone noticed what was happening above."

"Oh, that’s good to hear."

<b>

At 20,000 meters high, I hadn’t noticed because I was fighting above the clouds, but it seems the rain clouds effectively concealed the battle in the sky.

<b>

"Still, about those explosions, what were you doing…?"

"I’ll explain in a bit. So, are they unconscious?"

"Well, who knows? They might have taken damage that this mysterious suit couldn’t withstand, losing consciousness or their lives, or they could be playing dead to catch us off guard."

<b>

Hearing that, I realize that Alicia has positioned herself at a spot where she can immediately escape out the window while keeping her distance from the hero suits.

<b>

(Then I guess I’ll try to remove the helmet without directly touching them for now.)

<b>

I manipulate the slime binding the pink hero suit, ‘Rose Pink Baroness,’ to attempt to take off the helmet.

<b>

(…Can I remove this?)

<b>

Upon removing the side antenna-like part common to all hero suits, I find a small button inside.

When I press it, the suit becomes translucent, revealing the wearer’s form.

<b>

"Whoa!?"

"Oh my."

<b>

The identity of the person in that pink hero suit is clearly a girl younger than me who appears to be unconscious.

Moreover, her outfit is almost like underwear, making it quite awkward to look at.

<b>

"Hey, do you recognize this girl?"

"Recognize?"

<b>

As Alicia asks me that, I try to focus on her face while avoiding looking at her body.

<b>

"Ah."

"Did you realize?"

"Ah, yeah."

<b>

Trying to hide my confusion, I respond and take another look at the girl’s face.

Though her impression is different because she is unconscious, I indeed recognize her.

<b>

This girl in front of me is the same girl who was saved in the video that Alicia first showed me.
