# Episode 54: I Learned About Urban Legends 1

"Ah, air conditioning is the best, summer vacation is the best."

<b>

It’s mid-August. I’m sprawled on the living room sofa, munching on ice cream, and lazily muttering such things while staring at the ceiling.

<b>

There’s probably no period that can be called heaven like the summer vacation of a first-year high school student.

Unless you’re attending a particularly prestigious school or are considering going to a famous university, it’s not really the time to think about exams, so how to spend this month and a half is completely up to the individual.

<b>

There’s one person glaring at me with exasperation at my lethargy and decadence.

<b>

"If you’re that bored, help your cute little sister with her homework."

<b>

My sister Kana, who apparently has no practice today to save on electricity bills, is working on her summer homework in the same living room.

<b>

"If you have someone else do it, it defeats the purpose of homework, right? You should try solving it yourself."

"…Damn brother."

<b>

Ignoring the insults from my beloved sister, I opened my social media to see if there were any interesting topics to explore when suddenly.

<b>

"…Hmm?"

<b>

My smartphone vibrated with a notification.

Looking at it, it seems a message was sent through a chat app.

And the sender is… 

<b>

(Alicia?)

<b>

Surprised by the unexpected contact, I opened the app to find a concise message stating, "I have something I want to confirm in person."

<b>

Since she rarely sends messages, I could predict that something troublesome must be happening.

But… 

<b>

(Since I have nothing to do anyway, I might as well go for a distraction.)

<b>

Having finished my homework before summer vacation using my skills and not working part-time because of the reward money from Kuon, I have plenty of time on my hands.

As for going out in this heat, using "Wind Magic" and "Ice Magic" should make it manageable.

So, it wouldn’t be bad to check it out on a whim.

Besides, I’m curious about what kind of place a government special agency agent lives in.

<b>

Thinking that, I replied, "Got it. Let’s meet," and immediately received a map with the message "Meeting Place."

<b>

"Kana—I'm going out for a bit, so please keep an eye on things."

"Then can you buy ice cream at the convenience store? The one with the red lid is fine."

"Isn’t that the most expensive one? If you want it, buy it yourself."

<b>

After that incident a few months ago, my relationship with my sister has slightly improved, and while we exchanged such banter, I left the house.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"…Making me go through such roundabout things again."

<b>

About an hour after leaving home, I found myself in front of a typical apartment room that could be found anywhere, grumbling.

<b>

At the location specified in the chat app, all I found in this particularly upscale apartment was a piece of paper that said "Real Meeting Place."

Then I was directed to a warehouse in the suburbs, where there was another piece of paper stating "Real Meeting Place."

<b>

Whether it was due to the confidentiality of being an agent in a secret organization or just meaningless harassment, I didn’t know, but at that point, I was fed up and used "Tracking and Detection Magic" to forcibly pinpoint Alicia’s location and moved directly to her using "Teleportation Magic."

<b>

(…I’ll take my complaints out on the one who called me.)

<b>

Thinking that, I pressed the doorbell, and I could hear footsteps approaching from the other side.

<b>

"Welcome. You’re surprisingly early."

"Just let me in for now. I don’t want to stay outside any longer on this hot summer day."

<b>

Even though I can replicate the same conditions as a room with air conditioning using "Wind Magic" and "Ice Magic," seeing the heat haze, the sound of cicadas, and people walking around sweating makes me feel a sense of muggy discomfort.

<b>

"Alright, come on in."

<b>

Alicia chuckled at my state and guided me inside.

<b>

The room I was led into had only the bare essentials for living: a small wardrobe for clothes, a refrigerator, a microwave, a small glass table, a sofa that also served as a bed, a laptop, and an air conditioner, making it feel almost like a model room with no sign of someone actually living there.

<b>

"What do you want to drink? I only have barley tea or coffee."

"Then barley tea. …By the way, do you really live in a place like this?"

"This is Safe House No. 6. I only keep things here that wouldn’t matter if I threw them away."

<b>

Oh, "Safe House"—that’s a term that sounds very much like something an agent from a secret organization would use.

Well, that agent is doing something very typical of a Japanese person by pouring chilled bottled barley tea from the refrigerator into a glass.

That aside, I asked Alicia for permission and sank deep into the sofa.

<b>

"Here you go."

"Thanks. So, what is it you wanted to confirm?"

"…First, take a look at this."

<b>

Alicia handed me the glass of barley tea without hesitation and sat down next to me, opening a video app on her tablet to show me the screen.

<b>

What was displayed was a video captured by a surveillance camera in a parking lot somewhere at midnight.

<b>

"I’ll tell you in advance, this was filmed two weeks ago at 11:18 PM."

"…Two weeks ago, huh."

<b>

Because of the time, the parking lot was almost completely dark except for the light leaking from nearby vending machines and street lamps.

Coming into that place were four boys with dyed hair and three girls, likely a gathering of middle school or high school students.

At first glance, they seemed like a group of delinquents, but one of the girls—a timid-looking girl with black hair and glasses—was visibly frightened even through the video.

<b>

"So, you brought the money, right?"

"…Y-Yes. So you won’t send emails or messages anymore…?"

"Yeah, as long as you bring enough money to satisfy us."

<b>

Saying that, the boy with brightly dyed hair and piercings received an envelope from the glasses girl and checked its contents.

<b>

"Hey, there’s only 50,000 yen here. What’s the meaning of this?"

"I-I’m sorry… I tried my best, but that’s all I could gather…"

"Well then, you’ll have to pay the difference with your body, won’t you?"

"Just get it over with quickly. I don’t want to stay up too late."

"I know. I’ll just have a little fun and take some pictures and videos."

<b>

With that, the boy grabbed the girl’s clothes.

<b>

"No, no…! I’m sorry, please forgive me…!"

<b>

However, there were no other shadows in the nighttime parking lot, and the girl’s screams went unheard.

<b>

—Or so it should have been.

<b>

"Whoa!?"

"W-What is this!?"

<b>

Suddenly, an impact and smoke caused the surveillance camera’s image to momentarily distort.

<b>

And standing in the place where the smoke cleared was—.

<b>

"Prepare yourselves, scum. In the name of the holy hero, I, as your servant, will deliver divine punishment upon you."
