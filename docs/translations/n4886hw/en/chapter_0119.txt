# Chapter 114: The End of Becoming 1

"Here I go!"

『『GIGYAA!?』』

<b>

I equipped both hands with high-temperature, pressurized water swords and slashed through the black humanoid entity.

The humanoid entity let out a scream-like cry as its upper and lower halves were severed, disappearing into dust.

<b>

『AAAAAAAaaaaa！！』

"What!?"

<b>

Meanwhile, the giant doll monster used the humanoid entity as a decoy to circle behind me and attacked not me, but Kyōri.

<b>

"I won't let you!"

<b>

I generated a massive ice hand from my back, grabbed the doll's long hair, and forcibly slammed it down in front of me, also dragging the remaining black humanoid entity along.

<b>

『aaaAAAAAAAA！？』

<b>

The giant doll, crushed against the ground along with the black humanoid, let out a scream-like shout.

Furthermore, I generated countless ice pillars from the bottom of the space to immobilize the doll monster, and created a gigantic ice hammer, comparable in size to a house, in mid-air, which I then brought down onto its head, shattering it.

<b>

『a、AAaaaaaaa……』

<b>

The doll emitted a groan as it spewed forth black liquid from its cracks, eventually becoming unable to move and vanishing into black dust.

<b>

"Yaaahhh!"

『『G-GIIIII!!?』』

<b>

Next to me, the remaining shadow of the black humanoid was engulfed by the flames released from Kyōri's talisman and disappeared.

With that, nothing stood between that crystal and us anymore.

<b>

"I'm going to rescue Ikoma-senpai from that crystal now. So, can I leave the support to you?"

"……Yes! I will protect your back, Shuu-kun!"

"Got it. Then—"

<b>

Just as I was about to say I'm going, a sound like glass clashing echoed from the direction of the crystal.

When I turned around, the Ikai crystal that was imprisoning Ikoma-senpai was vibrating as if it felt some irritation, and it began to wrap its roots around the objects placed within this space, pulling them towards the crystal itself.

Eventually, it floated up, starting to take the form of a human figure far larger than that doll monster, with the Ikai crystal as its head.

<b>

『ゥゥゥゥ……』

<b>

I couldn't tell what principle was at work, but it let out a growl, using its gigantic foot, made of a mix of tree roots and concrete, to scatter the remnants of the doll-shaped monster, and directed the light leaking from the Ikai crystal, like an eye, towards us.

<b>

"Still leaving something like this behind…!"

<b>

I broke into a cold sweat as I formed a defensive barrier with 'Water Magic', looking at the thing that was once the Ikai crystal—a super giant golem.

Its size was incomparable to that of the doll monster. It was probably over 20 meters tall.

However, judging by the materials that made up its body, I thought defeating it would be easy.

The problem was whether it would have any negative effects on Ikoma-senpai.

<b>

『ゥゥゥアアァァァァ！』

"Ugh."

<b>

While I was thinking that, the giant golem grabbed a part of its body and threw it at us, but it was deflected by my water barrier.

…There’s no time to worry about whether it will have an effect or not.

I have to do something before it self-destructs and throws the Ikai crystal, with Ikoma-senpai sealed inside, at us.

<b>

『ァアアアァァァァ……！』

<b>

While I was thinking that, the golem turned its head towards us and threw another object that made up its body.

…Could this be?

<b>

"Shuu-kun… What should we do…?"

"Kyōri. Can you launch a distracting attack at the golem's head, or rather, the place where the light is leaking out?"

"I-I can do that, but…"

"Then do it in 10 seconds. Don't think about anything else."

"Y-Yes…?"

<b>

After giving that instruction to Kyōri, I generated a potion with 'Water Magic' to recover my MP and cast 'Body Enhancement' on myself.

Then, I steeled myself and jumped into the golem's embrace.

<b>

『ウゥゥゥゥ……！』

<b>

As expected, the golem turned its head towards me and tried to crush me with its right hand.

<b>

"I won't let you!"

『ゥアアァァァ！？』

<b>

However, that was interrupted when Kyōri's low-powered foxfire struck its head.

<b>

"Ha!"

<b>

Seizing that opportunity, I leaped onto the golem's left arm and climbed up towards its head.

Then, I wrapped my hands in gigantic claws using 'Water Magic', eliminating the roots and concrete surrounding the Ikai crystal, exposing its main body.

<b>

『アアァァァァアァァ！』

<b>

The Ikai crystal vibrated furiously, letting out a loud cry, and began generating a new head using roots and concrete, this time encompassing me as well.

<b>

"I won't let that happen!"

<b>

Seeing that, I immediately transformed the water claws into a water sword, destroying the things that tried to restrain me, and reached out for the Ikai crystal.

<b>

『アアァァアア………あぁ――』

"！？」

<b>

Then, the Ikai crystal stopped vibrating, its growls began to subside, and it started to emit a dazzling light.

I instinctively raised both arms to shield my eyes, but ultimately couldn't prevent it, and my consciousness was drawn into darkness――。

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Wh-Where is this…?"

<b>

When I regained consciousness, I found myself standing in the dimly lit living room of an apartment.

From the furniture around me, it seemed to be the same place as that apartment I had been in just moments ago, but unlike there, I saw no signs of wall or ceiling collapse.

<b>

(I need to first check what has happened to me…)

<b>

Just as I thought that and took a step forward, I finally noticed a young girl sitting right next to me.

The girl was bowing her head and sitting upright, continuously apologizing with "I'm sorry."

Suddenly, apparitions of what seemed to be her parents, a high school girl, and a boy of similar age to the girl appeared in front of us, opening their mouths.

<b>

"Why can't you do it like I can!? You're my daughter, right!?"

"…Ikoma? That guy is just a handyman, you know. Oh, don't say that. He'll probably sulk if he finds out."

"Hey, ghost girl! I heard your dad is going to abandon you!"

"You’re disgusting! Go hide that face of yours!"

"Wow, you're crying. How pathetic."

<b>

They began to hurl incredibly unpleasant words at the girl.

And then I understood.

――This is Ikoma-senpai's trauma.

<b>

As I couldn't suppress my anger and summoned a water sword to cut through the apparitions, the scene shifted again, leaving only the grown-up version of Ikoma-senpai and what appeared to be her mother.

<b>

"You absolutely have to follow in my footsteps and become a doctor! You have to show that person!"

<b>

The woman began to hysterically berate Ikoma-senpai, who, like before, kept her head bowed.

<b>

I can't take this anymore. This has to be cut off.

The moment I thought that――.

<b>

『You are not at fault. You can wish to destroy everything and leave it to me. ――First, let’s deal with that man who is invading your heart.』

<b>

A black shadow suddenly appeared, embracing Ikoma-senpai, whispering sweetly in a woman's voice while pointing at me.

And embedded in the chest of that black shadow was a crystal glowing in jade green.

<b>

(『Appraisal』)

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Ikai Crystal【Curse】Embedded Thought Induction Device

Effect: By recalling the trauma of the Ikai Crystal【Curse】's holder, it instills a desire for destruction to maximize power, ultimately fusing the holder with the Ikai Crystal【Curse】 itself.

Condition: Good.

Note: To incapacitate the target, the holder must strongly wish for its destruction.

<b>

―――

This thing is the root cause of this abnormal phenomenon and is messing with Ikoma-senpai.

<b>

『Now, all you have to do is wish. To destroy that man. If you do, I will resolve everything for you…』

"…Yeah, that's right. If I leave everything to you…!?"

<b>

Ikoma-senpai, seemingly lost in thought, looked at my face and then widened her eyes in surprise.

<b>

『What’s wrong? That man is your enemy. He’s a bad enemy threatening your heart.』

"Th-That's not true. That person cared about me…"

<b>

The black shadow continued to guide her to destroy me, but Ikoma-senpai was trying to reject it.

<b>

(…I don't know if this will succeed. Still, it's worth taking the gamble.)

<b>

Seeing their situation, I came up with an idea and mustered my courage to approach Ikoma-senpai, gently speaking to her.

<b>

"Ikoma-senpai. I don’t know what you’re carrying or how much pain you’ve experienced."

"I-Iori… You…"

"But both Kyōri and I, as well as Ibara, are on your side. So I want you to live comfortably in a sunny place, not in such a lonely place."

『That man is just saying pleasant things. Now wish for destruction.』

"I don’t want you to become such a sad existence that only thinks about destroying Ikoma-senpai! So please come back! I won't let you suffer from your past trauma any longer!"

"W-Well…"

<b>

Faced with the shadow and my words, Ikoma-senpai hesitated deeply, then suddenly bowed her head.

<b>

『Now, Ikoma Juri. Wish for destruction!』

"…Yes, I wish for your destruction."

『―――――Huh?』

<b>

When she raised her face next, what was in her line of sight was not me――but the black shadow.

Then, the crystal in the shadow's chest cracked, and the human form began to fade away.

<b>

Seeing that, I lunged at the black shadow and tore the crystal away.

<b>

"『Dispel』!"

<b>

Finally, I uttered the words to end this abnormal phenomenon, and the crystal emitted white light, filling my vision―――.
