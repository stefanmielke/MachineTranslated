# Episode 89: The Decisive Battle Has Begun 4

――10 minutes ago.

"Um, so... can Kuon Genji still use that monstrous power even if the property of 'Onawa' to absorb power from others is cut off?"

"…He probably can't. Only a universal ability user could suppress such power without an artifact. If he loses Onawa, he will revert to being just a human."

<b>

Hearing Kiyosato's answer, I silently fist-pumped in my heart.

Thank goodness, if that's the case, this battle should end easily.

<b>

I immediately activated the 'Item Box' and took out something that had been sitting inside since I obtained it during the summer camp.

<b>

"Then I'll leave this with Kiyosato. Use it to 'enhance your body' and just climb up, no matter what."

"Up, you say? Without fighting them?"

"Yeah, I'll also lend you a skill called 'Cognitive Disruption Magic.' We'll activate it together to make it harder for them to notice your presence. On top of that, this."

<b>

I generated a makeshift ice doll that intricately resembled Kiyosato right there.

<b>

"Furthermore, I'll cast 'Cognitive Disruption Magic' on this to make it look like you. And finally, there's this."

"This sword?"

"Yeah, it can cut things that don't physically exist. After that, the plan is to keep the thorns and Kuon Genji away while we cut Onawa. Can you do it?"

"That would put a burden on Iori-kun..."

"Don't worry about me. Kiyosato, just wait for that moment."

"…Yes!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

Thus began this almost improvised plan, but the result was nothing short of a great success.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah, ahhhhhh...!!"

<b>

<b>

For a moment, Kuon Genji was dazed, but when he saw the powerless Onawa, he let out a loud scream.

"Disappearing, disappearing, it's all disappearing...! My, my power alone...!"

<b>

Kuon Genji desperately tried to connect with Onawa using both hands, but of course, doing so wouldn't bring back his power.

Realizing this, Kuon Genji collapsed to his knees, bowing his head in despair.

<b>

What stood there was a broken man who had lost everything in a gamble to which he had devoted his entire life.

His eyes lost their light, and from the man who muttered something like a ramble, there was no sense of fighting spirit, malice, hatred, or anger.

Only emptiness remained.

<b>

At this point, it was very easy to neutralize him.

<b>

(Cognitive Disruption Magic)

"Ah, ah—……………"

<b>

"I am now in a deep sleep," I made him believe with the skill, and Kuon Genji instantly lost consciousness and fell to the ground.

Now, only one enemy remains.

<b>

To be cautious, I cast 'Magic Counter' on myself and slowly turned to face him.

<b>

"Now it's two against one, you and us."

"Indeed."

"Are you willing to surrender?"

<b>

When I asked this, the woman in the red kimono, Ibara, shook her head.

"Of course not, I won't make the foolish choice of surrendering when I'm not even cornered."

<b>

Then she grabbed her right arm with her left hand and―――.

<b>

"…Wha, what?"

"I-I’m pulling out my own arm…"

<b>

As if exchanging a doll's arm, she pulled out her right arm.

<b>

Of course, doing such a thing wouldn't come without consequences.

From the stump of her right arm, blood gushed out like a shower.

However, Ibara paid no mind to her current state, and as she pulled it out, she took out something resembling a mummified arm from the sleeve of her torn kimono.

<b>

"Th-that is!"

"You understood it at a glance. Impressive, Kiyosato-sama. But――"

<b>

Ibara pressed the mummified arm against her right shoulder.

Then, small tentacle-like appendages extended from her shoulder and the mummified arm, merging to form Ibara's new right arm.

<b>

"You were a bit slow to notice."

<b>

As Ibara wore a mischievous smile, flames danced around her, and the mummified arm transformed into a red, monstrous arm that was about the height of a person or even larger.

<b>

The sight reminded me of the final boss from a zombie game I used to play, causing me to instinctively step back.

<b>

"…Kiyosato, do you know what that arm is?"

"That is the arm of the demon that the Kuon family has sealed for generations――Ibaraki Doji. But why does Ibara have it...? Only a select few should know that the Kuon family manages Ibaraki Doji's arm――"

<b>

"It's a simple story. The one lying there, Genji-sama, told me about it."

<b>

Ibara interrupted Kiyosato's words, speaking with an air of confidence.

<b>

…I see, so Kuon Genji was being played like a puppet in her hands.

<b>

"Then did you infiltrate this house to obtain it?"

"Yes, that's correct. I have served the Kuon family and Genji-sama to obtain this."

<b>

Ibara gazed at her right arm with a sense of nostalgia, then raised the corners of her mouth as she looked at us.

<b>

"Now, shall we test the capabilities of this arm?"

<b>

The moment Ibara said that, a dark red droplet fell from her right arm, rapidly transforming into a small demon with black skin and two small horns on its head.

<b>

The number of small demons that appeared was at least 100, if not 200.

They looked at us with bloodshot eyes, drooling.

<b>

"Now, how long do you think you can endure this?"

"Ah!"

<b>

At Ibara's words, the small demons charged at us.

<b>

(Cryomancy!)

"Wow…"

<b>

In response, I immediately activated the skill, generating countless ice spears from the floor to skewer the small demons.

However, the small demons that were waiting in the back showed no fear at all, climbing over the bodies of their skewered companions.

<b>

"Damn it, they're just like zombies!"

"It is said that the small demons born from Ibaraki Doji's arm are emotionless puppets that faithfully carry out their master's orders! If that's true――"

"That means they're a huge pain in the ass!"

<b>

While listening to Kiyosato's words, I generated ice spears above the small demons' heads and mercilessly dropped them, then combined 'Water Magic' and 'Cryomancy' to turn the small demons and ice spears into an ice barricade.

<b>

This should buy us some time. In the meantime, I need to think of some countermeasures.

<b>

Just as I thought that, the ice barricade was destroyed by the claws of other small demons trying to scratch it, and then incinerated by the explosive flames released from Ibaraki Doji's arm.

<b>

"Haah… I'm disappointed. I thought you would clear these minions in a more efficient and attractive way."

<b>

Ignoring the raging flames, Ibara floated in the air, accompanied by a new swarm of small demons, and sighed deeply with genuine disappointment.

<b>

It wouldn't be impossible to blow her and the small demons away quickly.

However, since I don't know how long this great tree will hold, if I do something reckless and cause it to collapse, damaging the control panel for escape, all my efforts would be in vain.

If only Ibara were the only one, I could handle her a bit faster and easier.

<b>

While thinking about that, as I generated a new barricade with 'Cryomancy' to stop the small demons' advance...

<b>

"…I'll take care of those small demons. Iori-kun, please focus on defeating Ibara."

"What, are you serious!? There are this many!?"

<b>

When I asked, Kiyosato took out a talisman and set a corner of the small demon horde ablaze with blue flames, smiling confidently.

Then Kiyosato offered me the borrowed cursed sword and spoke with a serious expression.

<b>

"I haven't been doing nothing until now. So Iori-kun, just focus on defeating Ibara."

<b>

Honestly, leaving Kiyosato here alone, who had just been in a daze, makes me quite anxious.

However, it is also true that following her suggestion would allow us to defeat Ibara more easily and quickly.

<b>

"…Got it. Then."

<b>

I transformed the ice doll I had used as a decoy into a disc-shaped drone with 'Cryomancy' and deployed it to protect Kiyosato.

<b>

"Feel free to use them as shields. And please, don't do anything reckless that would cost you your life."

"…Yes!"

<b>

Hearing Kiyosato's reply, I shifted my gaze from the horde of small demons visible beyond the ice barricade to Ibara, who was looking down at us with a smile.

<b>

Next, I took out a travel bag from the 'Item Box' and lifted something that looked like a combination of a rocket and a tonfa from inside.

<b>

As a prototype for a pile bunker, I had created this with 'Design' and 'Blacksmithing' and it had been gathering dust in the 'Item Box.' I never expected it would actually come in handy.

<b>

Smiling wryly, I attached it to my left arm and aimed the rocket's tip at Ibara.

<b>

"Alright, I've got this covered."

"Yes! I'm counting on you!"

<b>

With that, I pressed a small button on the grip, and in an instant, I was propelled into the air towards Ibara.
