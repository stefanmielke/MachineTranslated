# Chapter 96: One Trouble After Another 6

"Ugh, we really got unlucky being on cleaning duty right after the holidays."

"Seriously. As Rentaro said before, our school should hire a cleaning service."

<b>

On the first day back from the holidays, we were trying to kill time with idle chatter while cleaning the classroom.

I shouldn't be that tired since I haven't used any skills today, but I'm exhausted from everything that happened during the break.

<b>

(Ah, I just want to go home and dive into bed.)

<b>

As I was lazily cleaning the floor while thinking about that―――.

<b>

"Iori-kun, Asama-kun, good work. See you tomorrow."

"Kuon-san, see you tomorrow!"

"Yeah, see you tomorrow."

<b>

Just before Kuon Kyori, who came to school for the first time in a while, left the classroom, she greeted us.

Rentaro responded cheerfully with his abundant energy, while I replied tiredly and somewhat curtly.

Kyori was called by Ueshima-san, who had already left the classroom, and hurried over to her.

<b>

It's amazing that Kyori doesn't show any signs of fatigue even though she must be exhausted from yesterday. She was able to keep up with the classes without any trouble; she's practically a perfect superhuman.

<b>

"Hey, does her greeting mean she’s interested in me?"

"…What would you think if I said the same thing to you?"

"Hmm, I’d probably think you’re dreaming and underestimating reality."

"That's the answer. Now, if you have time to move your mouth, use your hands instead. I want to go home quickly."

"Okay."

<b>

As we were having such meaningless chatter, a girl with striking bright hair, Alicia, approached us.

<b>

"Oh! Alicia-san, see you tomorrow!"

"Yes, see you tomorrow. And Iori-kun."

<b>

Alicia greeted Rentaro with her usual bright smile, then turned to me―――.

<b>

"Don't forget about the appointment at 5 PM."

<b>

She said that with a devilish smile.

<b>

"Hey, did you hear that just now?"

"An appointment at 5 PM, could it be...!"

"Could those two actually be dating...!?"

<b>

In the next moment, the students remaining in the classroom and hallway began to stir at Alicia's statement.

That girl...! She said that knowing full well it was a bombshell...!

<b>

"Hey, Shu..."

"Hahaha..."

<b>

I forced a dry laugh while trying to finish cleaning at breakneck speed under the piercing gazes of the surrounding students.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Damn it, making me go through unnecessary trouble..."

<b>

Using "Cognitive Disruption Magic" to shake off the pursuing students (mainly boys), I teleported from a back alley near the school to Alicia's current hideout, Safe House No. 6, while grumbling and pressing the intercom.

<b>

"Welcome. You look quite tired; were you playing tag or something?"

"…I had a rough time thanks to someone."

"Oh, what a coincidence. I haven't slept a wink because of someone causing a ruckus."

<b>

Alicia spoke with a smile, but her eyes were not smiling at all.

Ah, I can tell without even using "Identification." She's genuinely furious.

<b>

"…I admit it was wrong to barge in uninvited."

"That's good to hear. Now come in. You want to know what happened with the Kuon family, right?"

<b>

Saying that, she guided me to the living room.

…The reason I met with Alicia was definitely not some romantic story that my classmates might have imagined.

It was to hear about the aftermath of the Kuon family after Kyori and I left.

<b>

<b>

"Sorry to keep you waiting. I made barley tea like last time; is that okay?"

"Anything cold to drink is fine. Thank you."

<b>

After sitting on the living room sofa for a bit, Alicia came in with a glass of well-chilled barley tea.

I bowed to her, took the glass, and gulped it down in one go.

<b>

"So, straight to the point, what happened to the Kuon family after that?"

<b>

Alicia's organization has its own exorcists.

And with "Water's Eye" used for "Identification," I was already aware that someone from her organization was lurking at that location.

So before causing a ruckus, I sent Alicia a message saying, "I'm about to cause some trouble," and right after it was over, I contacted her to ask, "What happened to the Kuon family?" and arranged to hear about it that evening.

<b>

"Almost half-destroyed, but we succeeded in reforming the organization. The head of the Kuon family is nominally the top, but without power; the actual authority is held by a deliberative body called the 'Executive Council,' which includes our organization and other public institutions related to supernatural abilities, with representatives rotating from each organization and the Kuon family's senior officials. Even though it's decayed, we can't just abolish the organization that has been controlling exorcists overnight."

"Wait. Is there really someone who wants to become the next head of the Kuon family in this situation?"

<b>

Although it was my doing, I exposed the corruption of the Kuon family in a grand manner at that time.

I thought it would be a punishment game for anyone to step forward as the next head afterward.

<b>

"The next head will be approached by the Executive Council with someone deemed suitable. So it's not decided yet."

"Then who will become the head? Kuon Sogen has been poisoned and can't move properly..."

"The conclusion reached by the deliberative body is to keep Kuon Sogen as the head. As I mentioned earlier, the actual power has shifted to the Executive Council, so there's no need for Kuon Sogen to appear directly. He will be taken care of in the medical facility owned by my organization for the rest of his life."

"I see...?"

"Well, the higher-ups are very pleased that they could simultaneously apprehend the exorcists with a bad reputation and take control of the Kuon family thanks to your actions. The lower ranks like us had to struggle a lot, though!"

"I-I really feel bad about it..."

<b>

I don't really understand political matters, but I at least grasped that things are progressing according to the intentions of the organization Alicia belongs to.

Then, I should ask her about that.

<b>

"So what will happen to Kuon Kyori from now on? Is there a possibility that her life will be threatened or that she won't be able to attend school anymore?"

"Her safety and living conditions are guaranteed for the time being until she graduates from university, so you can rest assured. Besides, if I said I would just leave her alone, you definitely wouldn't accept that, would you?"

"Yeah, I would definitely go on a rampage."

"…I wish you had said you wouldn't do such a thing, even if it was a lie. Anyway, her safety is guaranteed, so don't worry."

"I'll trust those words. That's all I wanted to ask."

"Then can I ask you a question next?"

"Feel free."

<b>

When I replied like that, Alicia took a notepad and pen, opening her mouth with a serious expression.

<b>

"The entity that was manipulating Kuon Genji from the shadows, according to reports, seemed to be a puppet created by someone. What impression do you have of that?"

<b>

A puppet―――my impression of the mastermind who created the thorns.

I was pretty desperate, so I hadn't had the luxury to think about that during the series of events at the Kuon family's mansion――.

No, wait a minute?

<b>

"…It feels like a frivolous entertainment that took a lot of time and effort, or a serious game. Thinking back, that's how it feels."

"Does that mean they did all that as if it were a game?"

"I know I'm saying something strange, but I can't shake that impression..."

<b>

If the thorns genuinely wanted to obtain the Demon Arm, they could have easily escaped the barrier before we arrived by manipulating Kuon Genji.

Yet, they deliberately waited for us in the innermost part like an RPG boss.

Considering that, it feels like the one who created the thorns, or rather the mastermind, viewed the series of events as a game.

<b>

"I see. Thank you, that was helpful. I have no more questions for you."

<b>

After finishing listening to me, Alicia set the pen down on the desk.

<b>

"Is that it?"

"Yes, I have no other questions at this point, and it seems you have an important appointment as well."

<b>

Did she peek at my messaging app like during the Hero Suit incident in the summer vacation?

…I might need to prepare some countermeasures for that soon.

<b>

"I'm glad you understand. Oh, and make sure to help clear up any misunderstandings properly."

"I understand. Well then, see you tomorrow."

"Yeah, see you tomorrow."

<b>

After leaving Alicia's safe house, I searched for a deserted alley and activated "Spatial Transfer Magic" there.

<b>

After a brief moment of darkness, the surrounding scenery changed dramatically.

A desolate park where most of the playground equipment had been removed. From there, I could see the apartment where Kyori lived.

<b>

"――I'm sorry for calling you out when you're tired."

<b>

As I was thinking of taking a break on the only remaining bench, I heard an apologetic voice from behind.

When I turned around, there was―――.

<b>

"No, it's totally fine. M-Miss Kuon."

"You can just call me Kyori, Iori-kun."

<b>

It was the familiar sight of a girl in a school uniform, Kuon Kyori.
