# Intermission: Those Summoned to Another World 2

"Haah!"

<b>

Amagi swings the shimmering golden holy sword.

The wave of light released sends his opponent, a knight in charge of training, flying.

<b>

"I-I give up! I surrender!"

<b>

As the knight raises both hands in a sign of surrender, another knight acting as the referee raises a flag to announce Amagi's victory.

<b>

"Wow... that's ten consecutive wins!"

"To defeat that knight commander so easily..."

<b>

Cheers erupt from some of the students watching the match, praising Amagi's graceful swordsmanship.

As they say, Amagi had conducted ten mock battles in just one day and won all of them, against knights with rich combat experience.

It would be impossible not to be excited after witnessing such feats.

<b>

"Good job. I brought some water and a towel just in case, but it looks like you won't need them."

"That was truly amazing, Seiya-sama!"

<b>

As he sheaths the holy sword, two beautiful girls—Rin and Priscilla—run up to Amagi.

<b>

"Well, I'll gratefully make use of them."

"Still, to take down ten opponents without breaking a sweat... Seiya has really settled into the title of hero."

"My father also said, 'Seiya-sama is the strongest of humanity.'"

"Hahaha, that's a bit of an exaggeration."

<b>

Amagi laughs off Rin and Priscilla's praises while drinking water.

<b>

"By the way, what level is Seiya at now?"

"Uh, just a moment."

<b>

Saying this, Amagi takes out a jade-colored crystal ball from his pocket.

<b>

"Status."

<b>

As Amagi holds his hand over the crystal ball and chants "Status," his stats and skills are displayed in the air.

――――

<b>

"Wow, you've already reached level 65!?"

"Everyone helped with leveling up. Plus, it seems the 'Hero' title makes it easier to level up."

"No, it's all thanks to the hero's own abilities!"

<b>

<b>

"Tch, this is boring."

<b>

Meanwhile, some students watched Amagi with irritation and dissatisfaction.

<b>

"What the hell is that? All the credit goes to the hero, and we're just his lackeys."

"Hey, don't speak too loudly. If he hears us—"

<b>

"Do you have something to say to me?"

<b>

As they whispered in the shadows, Amagi approached them with a bright smile.

<b>

"N-No, we aren't complaining about anything! Right!?"

"Y-Yeah, of course. Everyone feels the same way, right?"

"Is that so? Well, that's good, but—"

<b>

"Wait a minute. I genuinely can't stand you."

<b>

While others tried to smooth things over, a male student provocatively challenged Amagi with an irritated expression.

<b>

"I'm sorry about that. So what do you want me to do?"

"Obviously, a duel. If I win, you stop treating us like lackeys."

"Well, I didn't intend to give you any orders, though."

<b>

Amagi smiled wryly at the male student's bravado, but with a practiced motion, he drew his sword from its sheath.

<b>

"Hey, idiot! You're not a match for him—"

"Shut up! I'm sick of being bossed around by anyone!"

<b>

The male student pulled out a large knife as his weapon and took a stance.

<b>

"O Heavenly God, grant me greater power! 'Body Enhancement'!"

<b>

As the male student activated his skill and charged at Amagi, some were astonished, some regretted not stopping him, and others mocked his reckless choice.

<b>

On the other hand, Amagi shot a cold glare at the charging male student and pointed his sword at him.

<b>

"O Almighty God, strike him with the lightning of judgment. 'Thunder Magic.'"

<b>

<b>

The 'Thunder Magic' released, using the holy sword as a magic staff, was clearly excessive in power, even considering that this world could heal moderate injuries with 'Healing Magic.'

<b>

"Gah...!?"

<b>

Hit directly by the thunder magic, the male student fell face down on the ground, smoke rising as his flesh burned.

<b>

"It seems I've won. Well then, I would appreciate your cooperation from now on."

<b>

With that, Amagi returned to Rin and Priscilla.

<b>

"Impressive, Seiya. Eleven consecutive matches without breaking a sweat."

"Indeed, the hero is the strongest envoy sent by the heavens to save us!"

"No, no, I'm not like that."

<b>

Meanwhile, a few of the defeated male student's companions gathered around him, desperately trying to heal him with potions and healing magic.

If proper treatment wasn't administered, that male student would die. It was clear to anyone watching.

Yet, the other students and knights did not attempt to save him.

The reason was quite clear; they understood that if they opposed the justice Amagi upheld, they would be the next to suffer the same fate.

<b>

The relationships among the students summoned over the past two years had changed drastically.

Initially, they had all been inexperienced in battle, allowing them to unite, but as time passed, they became divided into "Hero" and "Others."

And before long, the party and all those involved became dominated by Amagi and the "justice" he believed in.

<b>

<b>

The current students could be mainly divided into three groups.

One is the central faction made up of a select few who are enamored with Amagi's power.

The second is a minority of male and female students who, like the earlier male student, refused to follow Amagi and were burdened with menial tasks.

And lastly, the majority group that takes advantage of Amagi's influence to oppress the minority.

Such a situation further inflated Amagi's ego, worsening his self-centered personality.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Amagi unconsciously raised the corners of his mouth.

He had become the strongest of humanity. Even if he returned to his original world, he was a supreme being who could wield power as he pleased.

<b>

But Amagi did not know.

In the world he thought of as his original, there were those more powerful than him, and one of them was someone they had forgotten.

And in the future, he would come face to face with that powerful being, a fact that Amagi was still unaware of at this time.
