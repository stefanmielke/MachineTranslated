# Episode 55: I Learned About Urban Legends 2

『What the hell? Don't get in our way, okay!?』

<b>

One of the delinquent boys lunges at the suspicious figure in a full-body hero suit and full-face mask with a folding knife.

<b>

『Foolish ones』

<b>

In response, the suspicious figure in the hero suit mutters in a muffled voice, indistinguishable as male or female, and turns their palm toward them.

<b>

『――O holy dragon of thunder, imbued with pure power, deliver the iron hammer of judgment upon these wicked ones! 【Thunder Dragon Strike】!』

<b>

In the next moment, multiple bolts of lightning are unleashed from the suspicious figure in the hero suit.

<b>

『Gah!?』

『Agh!?』

<b>

The lightning strikes the delinquent boys and girls, avoiding surrounding objects and hitting them pinpoint, knocking them unconscious.

<b>

『I've only used enough power to knock you out, so don't worry. Though, you probably can't hear my voice right now.』

<b>

Saying this, the suspicious figure in the hero suit takes a smartphone from the unconscious delinquents' pockets and easily destroys it.

<b>

『Now then, are you hurt?』

『Uh, well, I just twisted my ankle a bit, nothing else...』

<b>

When the bespectacled girl responds, the suspicious figure in the hero suit bends down to match her gaze and holds their hand over her reddened ankle, saying:

<b>

『O holy brave one, grant me the power to heal this girl. 【Heal】』

『...No way.』

<b>

As a soft light radiates, the bespectacled girl's injury visibly heals.

<b>

『Well then, farewell, girl. Walk the path of goodness you believe in without fear of evil.』

『W-wait! Who are you—』

<b>

The figure in the hero suit stops at the bespectacled girl's call.

<b>

『I am one who has been granted power by the holy brave one who has returned from another world.』

『Can I also be granted that power!?』

『...Why do you seek power?』

『I don't want to go through this kind of experience again. And I don't want anyone else to go through this either!』

<b>

Perhaps moved by the bespectacled girl's desperate cry, the suspicious figure in the hero suit takes out a piece of paper from somewhere and hands it to her.

<b>

『What is this...?』

『If you go to the place written there, you too will be granted power as a servant of the brave one. What happens after that... is for you to decide.』

<b>

With that, the hero suit glows with yellow light, and they become a bolt of lightning, flying away from the scene.

And it seems that the camera observing the series of events was destroyed in the impact, as the footage cuts off after a moment of distortion.

<b>

<b>

<b>

「Now, let me ask you directly. Is the identity of the pervert in the hero suit in this video you?」

<b>

When the video ended, Alicia leaned in on me and asked as if interrogating me.

<b>

「No, that's not me. I spent the entire day in my room playing games, not stepping outside even once.」

「Do you have any proof?」

「I didn't bring anything, but the game console has data saved, so that should serve as proof.」

「I see...」

<b>

Alicia pondered for a moment and contacted someone using a rare flip phone.

After a while, as if she learned something, she thanked the person on the other end and turned to me.

<b>

「I’ve confirmed it. You were indeed engrossed in gaming during that time.」

「Seriously? You can find that out?」

「This much can be figured out quickly by any country's intelligence agency. Anyway, I'm sorry for suddenly calling you and doubting you. This concludes the confirmation.」

<b>

With that, Alicia began to start her work.

...No, no, no, after hearing all this, I can't just leave without saying anything or asking questions.

<b>

「Wait, wait, explain properly. What is this video? Why did you suspect me? And also—」

「Don't ask too many things at once. I'll answer what you want to know.」

「...So you will answer, huh.」

<b>

For now, I was relieved to know that I wouldn't be kicked out of the room in complete silence.

I took a sip of tea and thought about my questions again.

<b>

「First question. What is that video?」

「It was uploaded to a video-sharing site a few days ago. My organization quickly discovered it and deleted it.」

<b>

...It was uploaded online?

Does that mean the purpose of that video was for someone to see it?

<b>

「Then for the next question, was that not CG or edited, but something that actually happened?」

「Thirty minutes after that video was filmed, a man and woman with mild burns all over their bodies were urgently transported. Their appearances match, and a completely destroyed smartphone was found at the scene, so it seems to be true.」

<b>

So that suspicious figure in the hero suit is a real ability user.

<b>

「So your organization suspected me as the prime suspect because I'm not under anyone's control.」

「Just to clarify, I told my superiors that this pervert is not Iori Shu from the start.」

「By the way, what was your basis for that?」

「You're a person who acts purely out of curiosity, right? I can't imagine you doing something so attention-seeking.」

「...I see, you seem to understand me well.」

<b>

Saying that, I replayed the video to watch the scene where the hero suit appears and unleashes lightning.

<b>

「Still, it's surprising. An organization that can extract data from my game console in a few minutes can't find a single person dressed so flamboyantly?」

「...If it were just one person, they could have found them immediately.」

「What do you mean?」

「It seems they are operating in an organized manner. Also, the girl with glasses in this video has been missing since the day this incident occurred.」

<b>

With a full-face mask likely equipped with a voice changer and a suit that hides their body shape, and the fact that the contents are constantly being swapped, it seems like it would be quite troublesome to identify them through normal investigation.

<b>

While thinking about this, I activated the skill "Identification" on the suspicious figure in the hero suit and the bespectacled girl.

It has been confirmed that this skill works even through a screen. So I thought I could grasp their identities quickly—however, I was mistaken.

<b>

――――

<b>

<b>

Target: Peeping Canceller Scope

Effect: Protects the information of any target from all effects.

Condition: Good

Supplement: One of the functions granted to the visor of the armor suit.

<b>

<b>

――――

<b>

...I see, that hero suit is not just a costume but a real 【hero suit】 like those seen in special effects hero shows.

<b>

「Well, unless something major happens, I probably won't find myself in a situation to come into contact with them, so you can continue to enjoy your summer vacation as usual.」

「...Is that all?」

「Is that all, you ask?」

「No. I thought you might ask me to help investigate their identities.」

<b>

Given the flow of the conversation so far, I had assumed I would be roped into it, but...

<b>

「My job is to monitor and protect you, not to deal with these hero impersonators.」

「...So you really just called me to confirm?」

「Yes, that's right.」

<b>

I was taken aback by such a simple reason.

No, the message only said, "I want to meet and confirm something," so maybe I was just overthinking it.

<b>

「Well then, I'm leaving.」

「Oh, since you came all this way, you should stay a little longer.」

「What am I supposed to do in a room with only the bare minimum of necessities?」

「...How about some love talk?」

「There's no way that would last even five minutes.」

<b>

With that response, I began to prepare to leave.

It seemed Alicia was just teasing and didn't genuinely want to stop me.

<b>

「Well then, see you next week on the school day.」

「Yes. And please don't get involved in anything strange. The aftermath is quite troublesome.」

「...I'll try my best.」

<b>

After exchanging those final words, I exited Alicia's Safe House No. 6.

<b>

The suspicious figure in the hero suit is indeed concerning, but for now, I want to spend my summer vacation indulging in sleep and games.

I’ll avoid any interference unless it comes to a situation where I have to meet them in person.

<b>

<b>

―――I was thinking that way, but.

<b>

<b>

<b>

『Prepare yourselves, scoundrels. In place of the holy brave one, I, their servant, shall deliver divine punishment upon you.』

<b>

Just a few hours after that, I found myself encountering a suspicious figure dressed in pink armor resembling the hero suit from that video.
