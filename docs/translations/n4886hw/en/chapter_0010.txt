# Episode 9: A Model Student's Recollection

――side Fujisawa Haruna

<b>

Everything began with a truly trivial trouble.

Perhaps something in that argument had bothered both of us.

Eventually, it became a daily occurrence for my father and mother to fight, and they ended up not speaking to each other at all.

Even so, at that time, my father and mother might have been better off because they still cared about me and my younger brothers.

<b>

One day, after a while of entering junior high, my father did not come home.

If it had only been that day, my mother and we wouldn’t have thought much of it.

But my father didn’t come home the next day, nor the day after that, and he didn’t face us at all.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

“……phew”

<b>

After finishing my online class and closing the computer provided by the school, I put on an apron and began preparing dinner for my younger brothers.

It had been a year since my father disappeared and my mother lost interest in us. I was now completely accustomed to housework.

<b>

I checked the refrigerator and thought about what to make for dinner.

At that moment, I heard the sound of the front door opening.

<b>

(……this is the worst)

<b>

Peeking cautiously into the living room, I made eye contact with a woman lying on the sofa, drinking beer.

<b>

“Oh, you’re here. Perfect timing. Go to the convenience store and buy me some beer~”

<b>

That woman, whom I didn’t want to acknowledge but was my mother, said this with a face flushed red from alcohol.

<b>

“I can’t because I’m a minor. Buy it yourself.”

“Oh, I see. Then just get me some snacks or something~”

<b>

There was no reason for me to listen to my mother’s demands.

But I couldn’t endure being in the same space as her for even a second longer.

<b>

“……Fine. I’ll be back in about 20 minutes since I need to buy ingredients for dinner too.”

“Okay~”

<b>

It was too bothersome to change clothes, so I decided to go as I was.

As I thought about this and went to get my wallet, I felt a strange weight in it.

<b>

“……Mom, did you spend the money?”

“Sorry~ I just couldn’t help but spend it because it wasn’t enough~”

(……die)

<b>

Once a month, my father left us living expenses. That was the lifeline for me and my younger brothers now.

However, my mother was taking that money and spending it on alcohol and luxuries.

As a result, our household finances were always in dire straits.

I was truly infuriated and wanted to scream, but with her in that state, it would be meaningless to say anything.

<b>

“Oh, by the way. Kajiwara-kun is coming over today, so be nice~”

<b>

At those words suddenly thrown by my mother, I felt my blood run cold.

<b>

“!”

<b>

I grabbed my bag and roughly opened the door to go outside.

<b>

“……haah”

<b>

I left the house, but what should I do now?

I couldn’t just barge into a friend’s house, and I had to return home because there was a possibility that my mother, once the alcohol wore off, would do something terrible.

……But thinking about that man coming to the house.

<b>

“……ah”

<b>

While I was lost in thought, I arrived at the supermarket.

There was no helping it. For now, I would kill some time here.

<b>

“――Fujisawa-san”

“Oh, Iori-kun?”

<b>

When I turned around at the voice calling me, Iori-kun was speaking to me with a serious expression.

<b>

“Um, what’s wrong?”

“……No, I just noticed you looked troubled. Are you really okay?”

<b>

It seemed my face was that bad.

<b>

“I’m really fine.”

“……By the way, do you have my sister, Kana’s contact information?”

“Yeah, I have it, but…”

“Then could you call her today? She wanted to talk to you.”

<b>

Kana-chan and I had gotten along well at the dojo, and I had been thinking I wanted to see her again if I had the chance.

But thinking about the possibility of me venting my frustrations during the call…

<b>

“Of course, I’m not saying you have to. But Kana wants to rely on you. So I think it’s okay for you to rely on her without worrying too much.”

“!”

<b>

At those words, I felt a little weight lift off my shoulders.

<b>

“Okay. Then I’ll give her a call.”

“Yeah. Oh, I should get going now. See you tomorrow.”

“Yeah, see you tomorrow.”

<b>

After parting from Iori-kun, I bought the snacks my mother requested and the ingredients for my younger brothers’ dinner, killing some time before heading home.

<b>

“Welcome back~ Did you get it~?”

“Here you go.”

<b>

I handed the dried goods I bought to my mother and put the prepared dinner for my younger brothers in the refrigerator before entering my room.

Then, I took out my smartphone, which I hadn’t used for a while, and tapped the phone icon.

<b>

“Haah, haah…”

<b>

After taking a deep breath, I tapped on the contact for “Kana-chan.”

<b>

“……Hello?”

“Eh, ah, is this Senpai!?”

“……Yeah. Is now a good time?”

“Of course it is! I can’t believe I’m talking to you again…!”

<b>

Where had the anxiety from earlier gone?

I talked with Kana-chan about various things, forgetting the time.

……Perhaps because of that, I couldn’t notice what was about to happen.

<b>

“You shouldn’t ignore me, Class Representative. How could you do that?”

“K-Kajiwara-sensei…”

<b>

The man who had entered my room without me noticing, Kajiwara, my homeroom teacher whom I had to face every day in online classes, forcibly took my smartphone from me and ended the call.

<b>

Kajiwara, who was rumored to have caused an assault incident at another school, frequently came to our house as my mother’s second man and was the lowest scum who would inflict violence on me.

And I knew that his true target was not my mother, but me, and that my mother was completely oblivious to the fact that I was being targeted.

<b>

“It can’t be helped. It’s time for some education.”

“Stop…!”

<b>

No matter how much I trained in kendo, the difference in our physiques was insurmountable.

Despite my desperate resistance, I was pushed down onto the floor.

<b>

“Hey, Class Representative, why don’t you understand? I’m seriously thinking about your future.”

“No…!”

<b>

My arm was gripped tightly, sending sharp pain through my body.

I couldn’t take it anymore. Someone, anyone, help me…

<b>

<b>

<b>

――At that moment, a shadow appeared from nowhere and attacked Kajiwara.

Kajiwara was pulled away and slammed hard against the wall, making a loud noise.

What on earth was happening? As I stood there in shock, the shadow turned to me.

<b>

“Fujisawa-san, run!”

“I-Iori-kun…?”

<b>

The identity of the shadow was none other than Iori-kun, whom I had just met a little while ago.
