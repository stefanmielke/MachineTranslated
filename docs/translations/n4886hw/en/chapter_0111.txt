# Chapter 106: The Preparation for the Cultural Festival Has Begun 9

"I'm home."

"Welcome back, big brother!"

<b>

When I returned home and entered the living room, I saw Kana, who had just come back from the dojo, lying on the sofa and eating snacks.

<b>

"Hey, the living room is really clean. Did someone come over?"

"Yeah, my girlfriend came by."

"Wow, your girlfriend...!?"

<b>

Even if I tried to cover it up here, it would eventually be found out.

In that case, I might as well just reveal that I have a girlfriend right here.

Thinking that, I answered casually, but Kana was more shaken than I expected.

<b>

"Uh, um... since when?"

"Since this Monday."

"This week... then, does that mean the reason you said not to come home until this evening was..."

"Because my girlfriend was here."

"Uh, um... uh..."

<b>

Kana completely panicked at my words.

Well, it's not surprising that she would be shocked if she suddenly heard that her sibling had a boyfriend or girlfriend.

I would probably be flustered too if Kana told me she had a boyfriend.

<b>

"Well, since that's the case, I'm having a study session with her at home tomorrow, so I'll give you 10,000 yen for lunch and everything. Please go out somewhere. Oh, and the leftovers from the pizza, fried chicken, and salad I ordered for lunch are in the fridge, so please heat them up for dinner."

"Okay... I understand..."

<b>

Once I conveyed what I needed to, I headed straight to my room on the second floor.

I wanted to try out the idea I came up with in front of the station as soon as possible.

<b>

I left Kana, who was frozen in place, and went to my room on the second floor.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"My big brother has a girlfriend..."

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Found it, found it."

<b>

Once I entered my room and changed into my loungewear, I sat down in front of my study desk and displayed the skill list.

I had come across a skill while browsing to kill time after defeating the giant UMA until Alicia and the others arrived. Without hesitation, I learned it.

<b>

"Identification."

<b>

Next, I activated the skill "Identification" to check the effects of the newly acquired skill.

<b>

―――――

<b>

Target: Skill "Imitation"

Status: Skill Level 1/10

Description: By consuming MP, it can record human movements and reproduce them as one's own.

Supplement: n/a

<b>

―――――

<b>

(…If the description is accurate, it's the skill I was hoping for, but will it work out?)

<b>

In any case, nothing will start unless I actually activate the skill and try it out.

Something in the room, and something I can personally feel the effect of "Imitation"... In that case, maybe that.

<b>

I opened a video site on my smartphone, searched for "drawing videos," and tapped on one that showed an illustrator's hands.

Then, as the video started playing, I activated "Imitation" and watched as the illustrator created a beautiful illustration of a girl.

Once the video ended, I opened a blank notebook and took a pen in hand, strongly imagining "reproducing" the illustrator's drawing process.

To be honest, I have no artistic talent whatsoever.

Naturally, I couldn't possibly draw an illustration like the one that illustrator created...

<b>

(Huh, huh?)

<b>

As I took the pen, I began to draw lines with exactly the same hand movements as the recorded illustrator, smoothly sketching the same beautiful girl in my notebook.

However, when I reached the coloring stage, my hand suddenly stopped moving.

<b>

(Is it... because I don't have the tools to color that it stopped?)

<b>

There was no nausea or discomfort that comes with MP depletion. So, it seems I should conclude that "Imitation" stopped because I lacked the necessary tools for reproduction.

<b>

(If that's the case, then I should record up to the sketching stage and see if observing the body's movements is necessary for reproduction.)

<b>

This time, I selected a video of the illustrator's work that didn't show their hands, only their voice and the computer screen, and activated "Imitation" while watching it.

<b>

(Now, let's see how this goes...)

<b>

After the video ended, I opened a new page in my notebook and took the pen, but my hand didn't move on its own like before.

It seems that I really need to observe some kind of human movement for the effect to activate.

<b>

But well, if this is the extent of the drawback, it shouldn't hinder the realization of this idea.

Thinking that, I opened the messaging app and sent a message to Kyori.

Soon, a read receipt appeared on the message, and within a few minutes, I received a reply from Kyori.

<b>

"I'm sorry for the sudden message. Is it okay if I ask you for a favor now?"

"Sure, what do you need?"

"You showed me how to replicate the basic technique earlier, right? I'd like you to record a video of that and the subjugation technique being implanted into a shikigami. If possible, could you also capture the hand movements?"

"That's fine, but what are you going to use it for?"

"I'm planning to use the shikigami we created at noon to trick the students at our school and cover for Ikoma-senpai. I came up with a way to make that happen. For that, I really need the basic technique and the subjugation technique."

"Understood. It might take me a little time to send the video, is that okay?"

"That's totally fine. Thanks in advance!"

<b>

After sending that message, our conversation paused for a moment.

Now, while waiting for Kyori to send the video, I should look into "Imitation" in more detail myself.

<b>

"Alright, let's do this."

<b>

If I'm going to do some practical work at home, it should be something related to illustration.

Next, I should try it with all the necessary tools and materials ready.

Oh, and I need to check how the skill's effects change with level-ups too.

<b>

With that in mind, I opened the video site on my smartphone again and started searching for videos that could be useful for testing "Imitation."

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Oh, did you send it already?"

<b>

About 30 minutes had passed since I resumed my testing.

A notification appeared in my smartphone's notification bar with the messaging app icon, saying, "A video has been sent from Kyori."

When I tapped it, I found that she had sent two carefully divided videos of the replication of the basic technique and the implantation of the subjugation technique, just as I had requested.

<b>

"I'm sorry for the delay. Is this okay?"

"Perfect. Thank you so much. And I'm sorry for asking something strange out of the blue."

"I'm the one who should apologize for leaving everything to you, Shu-kun. If there's anything else I can help with, please don't hesitate to contact me."

"Got it. I'll do that next time. See you tomorrow."

"Yes, see you tomorrow."

<b>

After finishing the conversation with that message, I activated "Imitation" while playing the video and began recording.

Once I finished watching the video, I prepared a scrap of the notebook where the copied shikigami was sealed and a blank sheet of paper, arranging them on the desk.

<b>

(Please let this work out...)

<b>

With that final thought, I held my right hand over the scrap of paper where the shikigami was sealed.

Then, my hand moved away from my consciousness and began to move just like Kyori's hand in the video, causing a pentagram and a seal to emerge from the scrap of notebook paper and inscribe the same thing onto the blank sheet.

<b>

"Identification."

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Shikigami Seal

Effect: A seal containing a child fox shikigami. It can behave just like a real child fox.

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Supplement: Recognizes Shu Iori as its master and is subordinate to him.

<b>

――――

<b>

Seeing the information displayed by "Identification," I couldn't help but do a fist pump in my heart.

Finally, finally, I have everything I need...!

Now, I just need to combine all these materials.

<b>

"Item Box."

<b>

I quickly activated the skill "Item Box" and took out what I had sealed away since the battle at the Kuon family.

<b>

It was a doll that behaved like a living human, deceiving many into thinking it was a real person, and after the battle, it was frozen from the inside and outside, its movements sealed, and its eyelids closed.

I called it 【Ibara】.

<b>

"Design."

<b>

Next, I specified the doll called Ibara and the newly created shikigami seal inscribed with the "Subjugation Technique" as materials and activated "Design" to obtain the necessary blueprint for my purpose.

Then, based on that blueprint, I activated "Blacksmithing Technique" and combined the prepared materials.

After that, I repaired the missing arm with "Ice Magic" and "Water Magic"...

<b>

"Is this complete, then?"

<b>

The appearance was that of a beautiful girl clad in a red kimono with golden hair, and upon close observation, she didn't look like a doll at all.

<b>

"Identification."

<b>

―――――

<b>

Target: Shadow Doll

Effect: A doll that has been implanted with the shikigami's "Basic Technique" and "Subjugation Technique."

Like a shadow doll, it possesses a pseudo-personality and can perform a certain degree of autonomous actions. Additionally, it can be granted special abilities by modifying its body.

Status: Inactive

Supplement: Having been newly created through "Design," its pseudo-personality's activity has stopped, and all joints are sealed with "Ice Magic," rendering it immobile.

It can be reactivated by removing the seal and providing a certain amount of MP.

Remarks: Recognizes Shu Iori as its master.

<b>

―――――

<b>

The results of "Identification" were all good.

Now, the only question is whether it will activate properly.

<b>

I took a deep breath, removed the seal of "Ice Magic," and poured MP into the doll as indicated by "Identification."

As a result, the doll slowly opened its eyelids and displayed a gentle, smiling face.

<b>

"---You are my master, aren't you? I dedicate all of myself to you. Please feel free to use me as you wish."

<b>

Then the doll began to speak in the exact same tone as when we first met.
