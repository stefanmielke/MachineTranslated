# Episode 73: Invited to the Mansion 1

In the parking lot of a somewhat spacious convenience store near the suburban highway.

Called to a place that was considerably less crowded than usual, I was overwhelmed by something out of place there.

<b>

On the early morning of the first day of the long holiday, I headed to the promised location marked on the map that emerged by dripping blood on that letter, and there was a woman-shaped shikigami from the Kuon family, identical to the one who brought the letter, and a pure white limousine that an ordinary person would never have the opportunity to ride in their lifetime.

<b>

"Iori Shu-sama, is it? We deeply appreciate your acceptance of our sudden invitation."

<b>

Despite the lingering sweltering heat, the shikigami bowed deeply without showing any concern for the thick black kimono she wore or the outside temperature.

<b>

"No, no, thank you very much for inviting me. And this is just a little something... please leave it somewhere appropriate as it has a long shelf life."

"Thank you for your thoughtfulness. The master will surely be pleased."

<b>

Saying that, the shikigami accepted the paper bag without a hint of doubt and opened the door of the limousine, urging me to enter.

<b>

(Oh, this is something else...)

<b>

As soon as I entered the vehicle, the first thing that came to mind was the phrase "luxurious and splendid."

<b>

The interior of the limousine, with its large windows, was designed in such a way that it didn't feel cramped, and despite the long sofa, small refrigerator, television, desk, and countless wine glasses and various facilities provided, it still had a spacious feel that made one question if they were truly inside a car.

<b>

Knowing that the Kuon family lived in a rather expensive apartment and that the text that emerged with the map mentioned "I will pick you up by car," I thought they would come in a somewhat luxurious vehicle, but this exceeded my imagination.

<b>

While I was still dazed by the opulence, the shikigami took out an expensive-looking bottle and poured liquid into another expensive-looking wine glass.

<b>

"Here you go. Although it's just water."

"No, no. I was really parched on the way here, so this is truly appreciated."

<b>

Saying that with a forced smile, I took a sip from the glass of water.

<b>

"Well, I will be in the driver's seat, so if you need anything, please press the buzzer on the desk. Also, I apologize for the delay, but we expect to arrive at the main Kuon residence in about an hour and a half."

"Understood."

<b>

After conveying that, the shikigami exited the vehicle again and headed to the driver's seat, separated by a partition.

...Well then, it looks like I'm the only one in the back seat now.

<b>

I immediately lay down on the ridiculously long sofa and took a quick look around the car.

It didn't seem like anyone else would be getting in, so I had about an hour of complete free time until we arrived.

During that time, I might as well do what I can here.

<b>

As I was thinking that, I heard the sound of a smartphone alarm coming from somewhere.

It might be about time. There’s nothing particularly urgent I need to do here, so I’ll take a break and return my consciousness to that body over there.

<b>

I closed my eyelids and relaxed my entire body.

And―――。

<b>

(“Sense Sharing” off)

<b>

As I deactivated the skill, the familiar ceiling came into my view.

Sunlight streamed in through the gap in the curtains, and occasionally I could hear birds chirping outside.

Ah, there's no doubt this is my room.

<b>

(For now, it’s a success...)

<b>

While indulging in such thoughts, I got up from the bed and opened the smartphone that was on my bedside.

The first thing I saw was a very simple message from Kana in the notification bar: "I locked the door."

Speaking of which, Kana is staying overnight for a kendo training camp or something during the long holiday.

So, it seems I’m the only one in this house right now.

<b>

Feeling a slight sense of discomfort in my home, which was enveloped in silence with only me present, I headed to my study desk and started tackling the assignments that were given in larger quantities than usual due to the holiday.

<b>

As I continued to work silently.

<b>

Guu~.

<b>

At that moment, my stomach growled.

<b>

...Come to think of it, I hadn’t eaten anything today.

When Kana is around, I manage to prepare decent meals, but when I'm alone, even getting out the cooking utensils feels like a hassle.

<b>

Since I’ll be alone today, tomorrow, and the day after, I might as well just eat something quick and get back to that body over there.

Thinking that, I grabbed a nutritional jelly and a snack bar from the refrigerator and headed back to my room to check the current time.

<b>

It had only been a little over an hour since I deactivated the skill, and it seemed that nothing had been discovered about the setup, and the function I set to activate in case something happened hadn’t triggered, so I should be fine.

<b>

With that in mind, I placed a sports drink and a bottle of natural water on my bedside and lay down on the bed in a starfish position.

<b>

(“Sense Sharing”)

<b>

In the next moment, my five senses were shared with the body lying on the limousine's sofa.

As I sat up, I first checked the condition of this body.

<b>

(...Yeah, it doesn’t seem like anything has happened.)

<b>

There were no signs of foreign substances being introduced, nor any traces of my identity being exposed.

There was no time discrepancy either. Yeah, I shouldn't need to worry too much.

<b>

Feeling relieved, I looked at my arm again.

At first glance, the color, texture, and temperature were indistinguishable from those of a human. Moreover, with the "Recognition Obstruction Magic" activated to ensure that anyone who saw it would feel no discomfort, there were likely very few who could realize its true nature.

<b>

Yes, the body in the limousine is not my real physical body.

It is a【dummy body】created to resemble a real human using skills such as "Water Magic," "Ice Magic," "Wind Magic," and "Recognition Obstruction Magic."

And by using the skill "Sense Sharing," I can move this【dummy body】like a real human and directly convey what I say to the other side, allowing me to infiltrate enemy territory safely and securely while staying at home.

<b>

This is the trump card of the infiltration plan I devised for the main Kuon residence.
