# Episode 38: I Made Them Pay the Price 2

"Good morning, Seina."

"Oh, g-good morning, Kana-chan... Um, uh, I'm sorry!"

<b>

<b>

In the morning, at the school entrance, I reunite with my best friend for the first time in three days.

Seina, who was called out, looks at me with an apologetic expression and bows deeply.

<b>

"What's wrong? Why are you suddenly apologizing?"

"Well, it's because I called you out, and then something like that happened..."

"You don't have to worry about that. It was an unfortunate accident, and it wasn't something that left any scars."

<b>

Three days ago, I was called by Seina to that classroom and then got caught up in an accident... apparently.

I say "apparently" because I don't remember anything from that time.

When I came to, I found myself lying in a hospital bed, and the doctor told me, "You just lightly hit your back, and it's nothing serious, but just to be safe, you'll need to stay for about three days."

After that, my dad and brother came to visit, and the next evening, my classmates came to see me, but honestly, I still don't feel like I was involved in an accident.

<b>

"More importantly, I'm glad you were discharged safely, Seina."

"Y-yeah. I really wasn't injured at all..."

"Stop looking so apologetic. Come on, let's go!"

"…Yeah."

<b>

I pull Seina's hand and head towards the second floor of the school building where the second-year classrooms are located.

<b>

"Oh, by the way, I heard we can't enter that classroom for a while. Where should we eat lunch?"

"About that... The classroom next to the audiovisual room is usually available. Would you like to eat there?"

"Sounds good. Let's do that!"

<b>

Eating lunch while chatting and having fun with friends is nice, but I prefer to spend quiet time with Seina.

<b>

"A-also... could we exchange side dishes from our bento? My mom packed me a bento."

<b>

Seina's lunches are usually just bread that can be bought at a convenience store for 500 yen, and she's never brought a bento before.

From our previous conversations, I had sensed that her relationship with her parents wasn't very good, but perhaps it has improved.

<b>

"Yeah, sure. So after the fourth period ends—"

"Ah..."

<b>

As we chat like that, Seina lets out a small voice.

Looking in the direction of her gaze, I see the three girls who tore up her manga.

When they see Seina, they start whispering to each other.

<b>

Are they planning to do something to Seina again?

<b>

Thinking that, I step in front of Seina to protect her and confront them.

...However.

<b>

"Yikes, Amagi!"

"W-we're not planning to do anything! I-it's true!"

"We'll apologize for everything we've done! S-so please forgive us!"

<b>

The three girls, showing frightened expressions, flee from us.

<b>

"...What was that about?"

"Who knows? Well, if that's the case, they probably won't cause trouble for a while, so we can feel a bit more at ease."

"That's true. Yeah, I'll think of it that way."

<b>

With that, I head towards our respective classrooms.

The usual daily life with Seina has returned.

I savor that thought...

"Hey, what's with that face like the world's ending?"

<b>

When I enter the classroom, the guy in front of me—Asama Rentaro—is slumped in his chair, staring blankly at his phone.

<b>

"Aoi-chan said she wants to break up..."

"Ah, that's too bad."

"I had a feeling it was coming since she started contacting me less after I was hospitalized. But hearing it directly like this..."

<b>

While encouraging Rentaro, I look around and see a considerable number of boys also looking down at their phones, displaying a chat app.

The common factors among them are two: one is that they got girlfriends through a group chat just before the first midterm exam.

The other is that a little while ago, the bus they were on with their newly formed girlfriends fell, leading to a temporary loss of consciousness and being treated as a leave of absence.

<b>

Fortunately, all of them were discharged without any aftereffects from the accident and are in good health, but...

<b>

"Well, um, cheer up."

"Yeah..."

<b>

As I encourage Rentaro, a message arrives on my phone.

The sender is Kuon, and the content is "I want you to explain in detail in that clubroom after school."

After reading it, I look over at Kuon, who briefly gives me a sulky look before returning to her conversation with her friends.

<b>

Come to think of it, I pushed through without explaining much back then.

<b>

I type a simple "Got it" as a reply and also send a message to Alicia asking her to "come with me."

Alicia, who was chatting with other girls, checks her phone and gives me a nod with a wry smile.

<b>

"Everyone, please take your seats. We're starting homeroom."

<b>

Just then, Teacher Koshimizu enters the classroom.

I shove my phone into my pocket and begin to think about how to explain the series of events to Kuon.
