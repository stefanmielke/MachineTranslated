# Episode 79: Invited to the Mansion 7

『Gya, gyagyaaaan!!』

『Gua, giea!?』

<b>

The large monster, which seemed to be the boss, fell to the ground, and the smaller monster tried to escape from me, flailing around in confusion.

However, for some reason, the appearance of the monsters that had lost their leader became even more distorted, and eventually, their filthy bodies liquefied and completely evaporated.

In the end, what remained was…….

<b>

"Is it just this boss-like guy left?"

<b>

This one is also quite distorted, but it still retains some semblance of its original form.

In that case, it wouldn't hurt to investigate it.

Since it seems to be behaving quite docilely, I shouldn't have to worry about it resisting.

<b>

I approached the monster's corpse with my hands together in a gesture of respect and activated the skill 'Appraisal.'

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Hobgoblin summoned from another world

Status: Deceased

Note: Summoned into a hidden passage within the Kuon family mansion along with other goblins due to a reverse summoning experiment.

Additionally, due to this influence, part of its body has fused with objects from this side and is distorted.

<b>

<b>

――――

<b>

"……Hmm?"

<b>

I couldn't help but feel perplexed by the appraisal result.

Goblin, that's the kind of weak enemy that appears at the beginning of an RPG, right?

I had suspected that such monsters might exist in reality since I knew there were youkai, but why would the Kuon family be hiding something like this?

Moreover, what does the note about the [reverse summoning experiment] mean……?

<b>

"Oh?"

<b>

While I was pondering this, the large monster's body turned into a jelly-like substance and eventually evaporated, just like the other smaller monsters.

<b>

"Hey, does the Kuon family use things like that as guard dogs or something?"

"……I don't know. While they might incorporate Western-style techniques, letting those monsters run wild would be too dangerous…"

<b>

If I believe Koharu's story, this hidden passage is meant to facilitate the movement of the Kuon family members.

Letting wild beasts rampage in such a place would normally be a significant disadvantage.

Normally speaking, that is.

<b>

"Ah, and by the way! What was that just now?! I thought it suddenly exploded and disappeared, then you appeared unscathed!"

<b>

Ah……, I thought I could hide it in this darkness and smoke, but it seems I was found out.

<b>

"That was……, yeah, it's something that shows illusions to the surroundings. You know, like in those ninja manga?"

"……I see. If that's the effect of your ability, I can accept that."

<b>

It was a rather flimsy excuse on my part, but it seems that abilities are more versatile than I had imagined.

Well, there is also the possibility that she is just being considerate.

In any case, Koharu seemed to accept it and moved away from where the monster had melted.

<b>

"Ah, um, thank you."

<b>

And at the moment she passed by me, Koharu blushed and muttered softly before quickly running off into the darkness.

<b>

(Though her tone is a bit off, she has her cute moments.)

<b>

Now, I guess I have to walk around in my human form.

Feeling a bit annoyed about that, I followed after Koharu.

<b>

"I missed asking earlier, but where exactly are we headed?"

"Before that, what do you think of the current Kuon family?"

<b>

I've received some explanation from Alicia, but revealing everything here feels a bit dangerous.

In that case, my options are as follows.

<b>

"……It feels tense, I suppose."

"Oh, you saw it too, right? That state of my grandfather. With that, he can't lead the Kuon family. So, a war is happening in this house over the position of the next head."

<b>

I was honestly quite surprised by the state of Kuon Sougen, but the rest of the story was the same as what Alicia had told me.

However, a war is quite a troubling matter.

<b>

"So, the ones who tried to attack you in the great hall earlier were the main family faction, trying to make the next head candidate, Kuon Genji, the head. And the other head candidate, Sister Kyosato, is being targeted by the branch family faction."

<b>

This aligns with what Alicia had said.

That means…….

<b>

"Are you part of the branch family faction? You seem to admire Sister Kuon."

"……No. I just want to take Sister away from this house; I'm not part of the branch family."

<b>

Oh?

<b>

"You can tell just from what happened earlier, right?! Those guys are always whispering behind Sister's back, and whenever they get the chance, they approach her with filthy smiles, trying to make her bear their grandchildren!"

"F-Fine, just calm down. I understand that you hate the Kuon family."

<b>

However, that raises even more questions.

She doesn't belong to either the main family faction supporting Kuon or the branch family faction supporting the legitimate heir; where is she really headed?

<b>

"But well, if Sister becomes the head, those guys won't be able to act recklessly, so I thought that would be fine. But those guys……!"

<b>

At that point, Koharu clenched her fists tightly.

<b>

"The branch family members have started to imprison Sister Kyosato!? There's no way I can cooperate with those kinds of people!"

"I-I imprison her?"

<b>

I couldn't help but ask back at her unexpected statement.

Are they treating the person they plan to make their boss like that!?

<b>

"Why would they do something like that……? If they do that, they'll only earn the Kuon's wrath, right?"

"What the branch family wants is your power; Sister Kyosato is locked up in a room to prevent anything strange from happening to her, as bait to get you."

<b>

Koharu's tone grew increasingly rough as she spoke.

Well, I can feel her anger, and I'm also internally furious.

<b>

But, still.

<b>

"Do they really think that by doing such a thing, they can gain my cooperation?"

"Both the main family and the branch family are only interested in your blood and body that haven't fallen into ruin. They probably think they can bind you and extract your power."

"……Hmm? What do you mean by ruin?"

<b>

At my words, Koharu momentarily put her hand to her lips, as if realizing something, but then she seemed to resign herself and began to speak slowly.

<b>

"When a person awakens to their ability, at first, they are confused by their power and resist or reject it strongly. That's only natural, right? Because it’s clearly an abnormal ability."

"Ha……"

<b>

Is that how it works?

I mean, I did feel a bit confused, but I never thought it would go that far.

<b>

"But after some time, they begin to view their abilities as sacred to an extreme level and start to look down on everything and everyone."

"Why does that happen?"

"For example, if someone gains the ability to freely generate and manipulate fire, would they still think to buy a lighter or a gas burner?"

"Ah, they probably wouldn't buy them anymore."

<b>

I see. In my current state, I might be able to save on various things.

<b>

"As time passes and their abilities grow further, they start to look down on anything inferior to their abilities, and eventually begin to treat everything outside of themselves like toys."

<b>

Oh? This is turning into a terrifying story.

<b>

"And in the end, they even treat their own bodies as toys, unknowingly becoming beings of pure spirit. When that happens, their ego collapses, their power weakens, and they eventually become what we call youkai. This is the fate that nearly all who awaken to abilities face."

<b>

I couldn't help but shudder at Koharu's story.

I've only encountered youkai a handful of times, but I can tell that they are completely different from humans.

<b>

Could I become such a monster……?

<b>

"And the period until that happens is roughly less than a year. Only a few, including the founder of the Kuon family, have managed to remain human for more than two years."

"……A year?"

"Yes. And for someone like you, who has awakened to their abilities and remained human for several years, that's an exceptional case. That's why both factions of the Kuon family want your body, which shows no signs of ruin."

<b>

I can't help but wonder what it means to be human, but it seems that to them, I am like an incredibly rare item.

So much so that they would imprison someone who might become their leader as bait.

<b>

"Look, we're almost there!"

<b>

As I was lost in thought, Koharu suddenly stopped at a certain point.

There was a narrow opening, just big enough for a person to squeeze through, from which a faint light was leaking.

<b>

"What is this?"

<b>

In response to my question, Koharu wore a triumphant expression.

<b>

"Hehe, this is the hidden passage I created to help Sister Kyosato escape!"
