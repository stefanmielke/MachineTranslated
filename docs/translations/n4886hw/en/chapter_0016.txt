# Episode 14 A Meeting Between a Girl and a Boy

"Ha... ha..."

<b>

When Kuon took something like a talisman from her pocket, a blue flame appeared and was unleashed upon the small demon.

<b>

"Gyah!?"

<b>

The small demon, engulfed in flames, writhed in agony and turned to dust.

Seeing that, I thought carelessly, "Oh, did we do it!?" but Kuon showed no signs of lowering her guard.

<b>

"Gyagya!"

<b>

The moment the small demon was defeated, another one appeared from nowhere.

And it wasn't just one; there were twenty of them, which was quite a lot.

<b>

"Ugh..."

<b>

She must have exhausted all her strength with that last attack.

Faced with the newly appeared horde of small demons, Kuon finally fell to her knees.

The small demons approached her with wicked smiles.

<b>

I think I don't understand anything about what is happening here.

Even so, I knew that if I left her here, I would undoubtedly regret it for the rest of my life.

<b>

"...Alright."

<b>

Taking a deep breath to calm myself, I leaped out from behind cover in one go――.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

――side Kuon Kyori

<b>

"Gyagya!?"

"...Still, so many..."

<b>

I somehow managed to fend off one of the attacking small demons, but their numbers showed no sign of decreasing.

The order I received from the main family was to exterminate the small demons that had escaped from their seal and fled into the mountains.

I had experience dealing with demons of this level many times before.

So I came to this mountain without any doubts about the order, equipped as usual.

And this is the result.

<b>

"Kukiki..."

<b>

Sitting on a large rock in the back was a big demon, using my battered form as a drinking companion; that was the true identity of the one who had escaped from the seal.

From the aura emanating from its body, it was clear that it was a high-ranking existence, likely one of the Four Heavenly Kings or something close to it.

<b>

Did the main family not realize that the demon that escaped from the seal was that one, or did they send me to this mountain knowing everything?

Either way, I would never be able to confirm that.

<b>

I will die. But I have no intention of dying easily.

<b>

"Gyagyagya!"

<b>

A small demon with black skin and two horns lunged at me.

I took out a self-destruct talisman and poured all my remaining spiritual power into it.

<b>

At the very least, I want to take that big demon down with me. For that, I wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice my own life.

<b>

Just as I steeled my resolve and was about to activate the technique.

<b>

"Gyah?"

"!?"

<b>

Suddenly, a human appeared between me and the small demon.

He was dressed in a black tracksuit with blue lines on both the top and bottom, and his face was obscured by a hood.

I thought he was a man based on his build, but... that's not the point right now!

<b>

"I don't know who you are, but you need to run away right now! That thing is――"

<b>

I couldn't get the words out after that. No, there was no need to.

<b>

Without any preliminary movements, he completely encased the horde of small demons in ice and kicked it away with great force.

In the next moment, the ice shattered, scattering the demons within into tiny pieces.

<b>

I was left speechless by the unexpected turn of events.

He had trapped the small demons in a massive block of ice without any special tools or incantations, and then easily shattered it with a kick. Yet, I felt no aura of a demon from him at all.

Is he human? Or――.

<b>

"You bastard, how dare you kill my cute subordinates!"

<b>

Seeing that scene, the big demon threw its cup and glared at him.

<b>

"Tch, I don't like this. I can't even see what kind of expression you're making."

<b>

Can't see what kind of expression he's making?

From the position the big demon was in, it should have been easy to see his face. Yet, if it can't be seen, he must be wearing his hood very low. Or perhaps...

<b>

"Well, whatever. I'll find out who you are after I kill you!"

<b>

The big demon drew a large sword that looked to be several meters long from its sheath and swung it down toward him.

<b>

"...Huh?"

"What...?"

<b>

The big demon wore a confused expression.

The sword seemed to be deflected as if it had hit something hard.

Upon closer inspection, he was in a stance with his fist extended forward.

<b>

No way, did he just deflect that strike with a single punch?

There's no way a mere human could do that...

<b>

Meanwhile, he approached the big demon without caring about our shock at all.

<b>

"W-Wait! Don't you want treasure!? This bead alone is worth at least ten ryo! If you spare me, I'll guide you to the treasure vault where I collected this!"

<b>

Where did that confidence from earlier go?

The big demon threw away its shame and pride and begged for its life.

However, it seemed that the big demon's plea had some effect.

He stopped and began to ponder something.

Seeing that, the big demon smirked.

<b>

Then.

<b>

"Don't listen to him! That thing is a demon that deceives and seduces humans to devour their lives and wealth!"

"You bitch! Don't say unnecessary things... Huh!"

<b>

As I shouted loudly, he slowly looked up at the big demon.

I couldn't tell what expression was on his face when the demon saw him.

What I can say for sure is that it was something that instilled immense fear in the big demon.

<b>

He made a fist and stared straight at the demon's head.

<b>

"Heh――"

<b>

Then, with a speed that was almost imperceptible, he delivered an uppercut to the demon's jaw, sending its body soaring into the air.

After a moment, what had once been that big demon came crashing down from the sky.

<b>

<b>

As the area fell into silence, I felt my knees trembling.

It seemed I had finally begun to feel fear from his extraordinary power.

To be honest, I wanted to run away right now, but before that, I needed to confirm something.

Whether he was human or not, and whether he was an enemy to humans.

This was an absolute mission for me, Kuon Kyori, born into a family of exorcists.

<b>

Just as I somehow mustered the courage to speak to him.

<b>

"Bee! Bee!"

<b>

From somewhere, a silly-sounding noise was heard.

At that sound, he acted flustered, murmuring something softly, and then vanished from the scene.

<b>

"What was that...?"

<b>

Left alone, I was in a daze.

For a moment, I thought maybe it was all a dream, but the scene around me denied that.

<b>

For now, I need to report tonight's events to the main family. Though I'm not sure if they'll believe me.

<b>

Somehow managing to stand up, I set off on my way home.

<b>

――In the last moment, I felt a strange sense of déjà vu from the watch visible on his wrist.
