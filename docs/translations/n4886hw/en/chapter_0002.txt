# Episode 1: Left Behind

<b>

"Yo!"

"Hey, how was your report card?"

"The worst, that old hag yelled at me like crazy."

<b>

"Hey, did you watch yesterday's stream?"

"I did! That cosmetics line was super cute, right?"

"Should we go check it out on the way home? I heard they have it at the store where my sister works."

<b>

About 15 minutes before homeroom starts.

The students in my class, 2-B, were waiting for the teacher to arrive, chatting about trivial matters with a somewhat excited mood.

<b>

Today is the last school day before summer vacation.

Once we finish homeroom and the closing ceremony, everyone will finally have the summer vacation they've been looking forward to.

While some might be feeling gloomy about attending cram school for high school entrance exams this summer, most students are thrilled about being able to play freely.

<b>

Ignoring such scenes, I, Iori Osamu, was engrossed in my daily routine of grinding in a mobile game.

I had just transferred to this school about two weeks ago, and I still hadn't made any friends to call my own.

My classmates seemed unsure of how to interact with me, so while I wasn't being ignored, a subtle distance had formed.

<b>

—Once summer vacation starts, I should be freed from this awkward atmosphere, I thought.

<b>

"Ahhh!"

"Damn...!"

<b>

Suddenly, everyone in the class, including me, began to writhe in agony.

The students who had been chatting just moments ago couldn't even stand and collapsed to the floor.

One student tried to crawl to the door to call for help, while another attempted to pull out their smartphone, but was pushed to the ground by headaches, dizziness, and a feeling of pressure, failing in the process.

<b>

As I was confused about what was happening, chalk began to move on its own, drawing a shadowy figure resembling a person on the blackboard, and a voice that could be either male or female echoed in sync with the chalk figure's movements.

<b>

"I'm sorry for the rough treatment.

But without this, it seemed you wouldn't listen to me, right? So, well, just try to endure it."

<b>

Though the expression was hidden, the chalk-drawn figure seemed to mock the writhing students.

<b>

"Now then, let's start with introductions. My name is Ashera. I'm your guide to another world."

<b>

Upon hearing the words "another world," some students showed signs of joy, some were bewildered, and others desperately tried to find a way out of the situation.

Meanwhile, Ashera continued speaking, completely ignoring them.

<b>

"First of all, congratulations! The 25 of you in this classroom have been chosen as heroes to save the world!"

<b>

Huh, 25 people? That's strange. There shouldn't be any absentees today, so there should be 26 of us in this classroom, including me...

<b>

"You all felt headaches and dizziness, right? That was proof that skills and statuses have manifested within you. Without them, you wouldn't be able to survive in the world you're about to enter."

<b>

Ashera said this, then picked up a piece of paper that seemed to be a seating chart for our class, showing it to us.

<b>

"Now, everyone listed on this paper will inevitably be transported to another world. In that world, there will be threats and vicious monsters you've never experienced before waiting for you. Overcome those challenges and become the heroes who save the world! Well then!"

<b>

With that, the voice ceased, and the chalk-drawn figure on the blackboard dissipated.

What remained was just us, freed from the feeling of pressure.

<b>

"Damn it, damn it! Why won't the door open?!"

"I don't want to! Let me go home!"

<b>

The students all rushed to the classroom door, but for some reason, it wouldn't budge at all.

Meanwhile, a gigantic glowing magic circle appeared on the ceiling, slowly descending to engulf us.

<b>

On the other hand, I was contemplating the seating chart that Ashera had shown us.

If I wasn't mistaken, that was the one announced right after the class division at the start of the new semester. My name wasn't on it, and the date was listed as April.

If that's the case, does that mean they don't recognize me? If so, what will happen to me now?

<b>

While I was thinking about this, the magic circle continued to descend, and then—

<b>

"Where is this...?"

<b>

When I woke up, it seemed I was in a hospital room.

As I wondered why I was lying here, a man in a white coat, looking like a Japanese doctor, entered my field of vision.

The man in the white coat took out a penlight from his chest pocket and shone it in my eyes to check something.

<b>

"Do you have any dizziness or headaches?"

"N-no, I'm fine."

"That's good to hear. However, just in case, you'll need to be hospitalized for a couple of days for tests."

"Um, by the way, which hospital is this...?"

<b>

When I think of another world, I first imagine something medieval European, like in games or light novels, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the world Ashera is taking us to is like that.

Keeping that in mind, I asked for confirmation, and the man in the white coat smiled gently as if to reassure me and said,

<b>

"This is ■■ Hospital. Your family is on their way here, so you don't need to worry."

<b>

I recognized the name of that hospital.

It was the largest hospital in the town I had moved to, and I had actually come here to get vaccinated.

Moreover, this person said that my family was on their way.

Does that mean this is Japan?

<b>

"Well then, I'll be going back. If you need anything, just press the nurse call button over there."

"Understood."

<b>

With that, the doctor tried to leave the room.

I didn't know why I had been brought to the hospital, but if this was Japan, then everything that happened with Ashera must have been a dream I had.

Oh, right.

<b>

"Um, by the way, why did I end up being hospitalized?"

"That is..."

<b>

At my casual question, the doctor fell silent with a serious expression.

Huh? Did I ask something I shouldn't have?

<b>

As I was filled with anxiety, the doctor made a phone call.

Before long, a nurse entered the room carrying a white paper bag and handed it to the doctor.

<b>

"...I personally oppose giving this to you. But if you really want to know, be prepared to see it. And don't touch any information other than the news; if something happens, stop looking at it immediately and press the nurse call button, okay?"

"Uh..."

<b>

With that, the doctor left the room again, accompanied by the nurse.

<b>

...Why was he so insistent about that?

As more questions arose, I cautiously peered into the paper bag.

<b>

"This is... my smartphone?"

<b>

From the conversation, I had a hunch it was related to my smartphone and the internet, but why did they keep this away from me?

<b>

(Should I just open it?)

<b>

Thinking that, I entered the password and opened the smartphone...

<b>

"Explosion accident at ■■ Middle School."

"25 students missing."

"…Huh?"

<b>

I let out a dumbfounded voice at the breaking news that suddenly popped up on the news app.

The article included a photo of the school building I attended, showing signs of being gouged out, indicating the seriousness of the situation.

<b>

As all that information flooded my mind, I fell back onto the bed.

No, no, no, wait a minute. Could it be, could it really be?

<b>

"Are you serious? Did it really happen? The transfer to another world?"

<b>

What I thought was only something that happened in light novels and online stories had become a reality.

While I struggled to comprehend this fact, I began to think about why I was the only one who survived.

Well, I had a vague idea about that.

Ashera had targeted that class before I transferred there. So, I managed to avoid being caught up in that disaster.

<b>

"That was proof that skills and statuses have manifested within you."

<b>

Suddenly, the words spoken by someone claiming to be Ashera flashed through my mind.

<b>

Since I wasn't transferred, and in fact, I wasn't even on their radar, I couldn't believe I was granted such powers.

Still, maybe— 

<b>

With that lighthearted thought, I mentally focused on "status."

<b>

"No way..."

<b>

I was bewildered and froze at the sudden appearance of it.

I couldn't go to another world. So, I would continue living as an ordinary person, aside from being caught up in this bizarre incident.

I thought that was the case—

Before my eyes floated something like a display in the air, inscribed with text resembling a game status.
