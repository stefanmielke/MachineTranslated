# Episode 40: The Forest School Has Begun 1

"As you all probably already know, the forest school will take place for three days starting next Wednesday. In today's LHR, we will decide on the roles for the event."

<b>

With the final exams over and the midsummer days beginning to increase in early July, I listened to Mr. Koshimizu's talk while feeling an overwhelming drowsiness from being full after lunch and the warm sunlight streaming in through the window.

<b>

First-year students at this school go to the forest school every year at this time.

The activities are quite ordinary, including mountain climbing, river rafting, cooking with rice boxes, barbecuing, having campfires, and also a haunted house that doubles as orienteering.

This would be my first overnight school event since the boring group activities I had in middle school before transferring.

<b>

"We will now distribute the booklet about this forest school, so please pass it from the front to the back."

<b>

As I was thinking about this, the booklet was being passed from the front.

I secured my copy and handed the remaining ones to the student directly behind me, then peeked inside.

It contained the schedule for the three days, contact information for the accommodation, and a list of students who would be staying together, as well as the class group names.

<b>

My group is Group A, and the members are Rentaro, Alicia, Kuon, and the two students behind me, Yoshinori Kobayashi and Kanae Ueshima, making a total of six people.

Looking at it this way, it seems like they divided us up randomly based on our seating order.

<b>

"Everyone has received their booklets. Now, please gather in your groups to decide on the roles."

<b>

At Mr. Koshimizu's instruction, we pushed our desks together to form one group.

<b>

"The roles include... a group leader to manage the group, someone in charge of cooking with rice boxes, someone responsible for the campfire, and a preparation role for the haunted house."

"It seems like everyone has to take on some role. I wish I could just slack off."

<b>

While engaging in such casual conversation, we discussed who would take on which role.

<b>

In the end, Alicia became the group leader, Rentaro took charge of the campfire, Kobayashi was in charge of setting up outdoor equipment, and I ended up being responsible for cooking with rice boxes.

And the most surprising thing was...

<b>

"It's unexpected that Mia-chan volunteered for the haunted house."

"That's right. I also had the impression that Kyori wouldn't want to do this kind of work."

"I got interested when I saw it at first... Is that bad?"

"I think it's fine. It's best to do what you want to do in situations like this."

"I'm also thrilled to be in the same role as Mia-chan!"

<b>

The remaining two, Kuon and Ueshima, volunteered for the haunted house, which was the most colorful role and required exactly two people.

However, upon reflection, Kuon is an expert on spiritual matters.

Considering that, this role might actually suit Kuon the best in a way.

<b>

"Hey, Shu, Kobayashi. Do you know about the 'Campfire Matchmaking Legend'?"

<b>

As I was thinking about that, Rentaro leaned in and whispered to me.

<b>

"A legend? What’s that?"

"Apparently, if you watch the campfire with someone you like on the last day, your wish will come true."

<b>

...This sounds like another cliché legend, like something under a cherry blossom tree.

<b>

"So, what does that have to do with anything?"

"...I want you guys to witness my once-in-a-lifetime grand performance."

"You don't mean...?"

"Yeah, I'm going to do it. Confess to Kuon-san! I want to watch the campfire together!"

<b>

After that incident, Rentaro, who had broken up with his girlfriend (who he had been forced into a relationship with against her will), was feeling down.

During that time, he genuinely fell for Kuon, who kindly spoke to him while he was feeling low.

Well, at that time, Kuon was simply worried about a classmate who was feeling down and spoke to him without any ulterior motives, but mentioning that would be rather rude.

<b>

"Um... good luck."

"I'm rooting for you...?"

"Yeah!"

<b>

Even if he ends up failing spectacularly, it will be an experience for the future. While thinking that, I silently prayed in my heart.

<b>

"Oh, we also need to think about the pairings for the haunted house."

<b>

Alicia murmured that, and when I looked at the booklet, it indeed stated, "Please decide on the pairings for the haunted house within your group in advance."

The haunted house is to be done in pairs of two.

And each group consists of three boys and three girls, making a total of six people. It can't be just boys or just girls.

<b>

In that case...

<b>

"How about we decide by drawing lots?"

"I'm in favor."

"I also agree with Iori's suggestion."

"Yes, I think that's a good idea."

<b>

When I proposed this, the group members immediately agreed.

These things are rarely decided easily through lengthy discussions, so it's better to leave it to chance.

<b>

I quickly tore six pages from a blank notebook and marked them with a three-color ballpoint pen, then mixed them in my hands.

<b>

"Whoever draws what, there will be no hard feelings."

"Okay."

"I-I understand...!"

<b>

Rentaro and the others pulled out the paper they thought was "the one!"

<b>

"I got... ugh, I'm paired with Kobayashi."

"There's no helping it. This is fate. Let's accept it gracefully."

<b>

"Alicia-san, nice to meet you!"

"Yes, Kanae."

<b>

So Rentaro paired with Kobayashi, and Alicia with Ueshima.

...Which means.

<b>

"Um, Iori-kun. Let's do our best together for the haunted house."

"Y-yeah. That's right."

<b>

I never expected to end up as the only mixed-gender pair.

Feeling flustered by the unexpected turn of events and Rentaro's gaze, I nodded back at Kuon.
