# Episode 77: Invited to the Mansion 5

『Gya Gya!』

<b>

The monster looked at us with its yellow, murky goat-like eyes and let out a lewd laugh before disappearing back into the darkness.

<b>

Damn, in this fake body state, it's not just difficult to counterattack, but even to use 'Appraisal' to confirm its identity.

That means the actions we can take are...

<b>

"I just want to confirm, if we go through that door, we can return to the mansion, right?"

"Uh, um... yes, that's correct. But the places you can exit from around here are where the people who attacked you..."

<b>

Koharu answered my question with a visibly frightened demeanor.

<b>

...I see, so if we go outside, we might run into those who attacked us in that great hall.

If the fake body was in perfect condition, we could have taken that option, but with the sensitivity of 'Shared Senses' being so poor...

<b>

"Kya!"

"......!"

<b>

Once again, a short dagger was thrown at Koharu from the darkness, and I managed to shield her with the arm of the fake body.

It seems the creature has realized that we can't counterattack, and that Koharu is the weak point.

<b>

(Ah, this arm is completely useless now.)

<b>

Seeing my right arm, which had become completely nonfunctional from the previous attack, I made that judgment and returned my gaze to the darkness.

Even if we escape through the door, waiting for us on the other side is another enemy, and it would be impossible to withstand that monster's attack in this broken fake body.

<b>

Then I guess I have no choice but to brace myself.

<b>

"Koharu, can you use any techniques to defend against attacks?"

"I can, but... I can only defend once, and if I get attacked multiple times..."

"That's enough. Listen, when I give the signal, protect yourself with all your might. In the meantime, I'll hold down that monster. You take that chance to escape with all your strength."

"Uh... but what about you...?"

"Don't worry about me. Just think about yourself."

<b>

I gently patted the head of the trembling Koharu with the other arm that could barely move, and I stared into the darkness, waiting for that moment to come.

And then――.

<b>

『Gya Gya Gya...!!』

<b>

As that laugh echoed again, a black shadow began to dart around us.

Now, this is the genuine last chance.

I need to tighten my focus.

<b>

『Gya Gya...』

<b>

The monster, clinging to the ceiling, moved its goat-like eyes vigorously to catch sight of us, and took out a dagger from somewhere, preparing to attack.

And then――.

<b>

『Gya!』

<b>

The monster threw the dagger again, aiming for the top of Koharu's head.

<b>

"Now!"

"Y-yes!"

<b>

At my signal, Koharu took out a talisman from her pocket and began to unfold something like a magic circle around us.

<b>

(It seems she's okay over there. Then I...)

<b>

Confirming Koharu's situation, I maximized the sensitivity of 'Shared Senses' and began preparing to activate the mechanism I had set up in the torso of this fake body, just in case.

<b>

『Gya Gya Gya!』

<b>

On the other hand, the monster, seeing me standing there in tatters, determined it could easily take me down. It readied a hatchet and lunged at me with force.

<b>

(...Here!)

<b>

I timed the activation of the fake body's mechanism as the distance to the monster closed.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

『Gya Gya Gya!?』

<b>

For a moment, I was frozen, not understanding what had just happened.

Before me, there should have definitely been that man, Iori Shu.

Yet...

<b>

(What on earth just happened...?)

<b>

In the instant the monster closed in on us, Iori Shu burst away from the spot like an explosion, and his scattered body turned into countless shards of ice that attacked the monster.

<b>

『Gya... Gya Gya』

<b>

The monster writhed in agony from the ice that pierced its body.

<b>

Is this the opening Iori Shu was talking about? Is he safe? Questions and anxieties flooded my mind one after another.

...Even so, I have to do what I can.

<b>

(It's frustrating, but he's someone that Kyosato sister acknowledged. If he said not to worry, then I will believe that...!)

<b>

Somehow gathering my willpower, I stood up and tried to move away from the spot with heavy steps.

<b>

...But.

<b>

"Hyah...!"

『Gya... Gya Hi...』

<b>

The monster grabbed my right leg with its further distorted and crumbling arm.

Its grip was terrifyingly strong, contrary to its appearance, and my leg gradually turned blue and purple.

<b>

"Ugh, let go of me...!"

<b>

I kicked at that disgusting face with my other leg repeatedly in an attempt to break free, but the monster wouldn't let go.

Instead, it pulled my captured right leg toward itself and dragged me down.

<b>

『Gya Aaaah!』

<b>

The monster licked its lips and began to touch my body with lewd hands.

Of course, I desperately resisted, but in my current state, weakened by fear and the intense pain in my leg, there was no way I could shake it off.

<b>

『Gya Hi Hi Hi Hi...!』

"Hyah..."

<b>

The monster loomed over me, showing off its filthy face, and brought its long, snake-like tongue close to my body.

<b>

"No, no...! Someone, help me...!"

<b>

With tears in my eyes, I desperately screamed in my heart.

But deep down, I knew the truth. There was no way my feelings would reach anyone. I couldn't fulfill the promise of bringing that monster to Kyosato sister, and I would be mercilessly devoured by that creature without anyone knowing.

<b>

『Gya Gya!』

<b>

Just then, the monster's outstretched claws grabbed my clothes, and at that moment when I closed my eyes, thinking this was it.

<b>

"Get away!"

『Gya, Gya Gya!?』

<b>

With someone's shout and the monster's distant scream, the weight that had been on my body suddenly vanished.

<b>

As I fearfully opened my eyes to see what had happened, there stood――.

<b>

"Sorry. It took me a while to get back here."

<b>

Iori Shu, looking apologetic as he spoke to me, effortlessly deflected the hatchet thrown by that monster with just his bare arm, which had no magical enhancements.
