# Chapter 94: After One Trouble, 4

"Kyori, are you okay?"

<b>

I found Kyori crouched down in one corner of a space at the end of a secret passage in the Kuon family's main residence, where stairs extended in all directions. I sat down next to her and spoke in as calm a tone as possible.

<b>

"…Iori-kun? How did you get here?"

"I learned about it from Koharu before. They say the Kuon family made a hidden passage that even the old folks don’t know about."

"…Is that so? Ah, I'm sorry. I suddenly ran out like this. I'm okay now, so I'll go back right away."

<b>

Kyori spoke like that, but the expression on her face was clearly a forced smile, and her eyes were swollen.

…How can I believe her when she says she's "okay"?

<b>

"You don't have to go back right away. It's fine to calm down a bit more first, right?"

"But, but everyone is calling for me—"

<b>

Listening closely, I could indeed hear voices calling "Kyori-sama!" from beyond the sliding door at the end of the stairs.

…There are about 30 to 50 entrances to this space at a glance; I can wrap this up quickly.

Thinking that, I formed a soundproof barrier using "Ice Magic," "Water Magic," and "Cognitive Disruption Magic," sealing off all the entrances.

Kyori would probably notice soon enough, but at least I should be able to buy some time.

Plus, I left a small drone at the venue, so if they resort to any drastic measures, I can respond.

<b>

"Hm? I can't hear anything at all."

"Eh, but…? Huh?"

"See, you don't hear anything, right? So let's prioritize calming down for now. If you want to be alone, I can leave right away."

<b>

At that time, I would use "Cognitive Disruption Magic" to put to sleep those calling for Kyori on the other side of the door.

Should I show them a nightmare so they won't feel motivated for a while?

As I was thinking about such things…

<b>

"Um, could we talk together for a little while?"

<b>

Kyori shyly asked me.

I couldn't believe talking with someone like me would lift her spirits, but if that's what she wanted, I would respond.

<b>

"So, what do you want to talk about? Just so you know, I'm not at all knowledgeable about trends, so don't expect much."

"Hehe, I'm the same way."

"Is that so? I thought since your hair and casual clothes are so neatly put together, you must be keeping up with trends."

"Eh, ah, thank you…"

<b>

…Yeah, this feels like I'm trying to hit on her or something.

So, how should I expand the conversation from here?

<b>

"By the way, why did you come to this mansion, Iori-kun?"

<b>

At that moment, Kyori tossed the ball back to me.

It's hard to tell who's trying to help whom here.

<b>

"Um, first, I received a letter after summer vacation."

"A letter?"

"Yeah. A shikigami from the Kuon family was standing in front of my house. It said if I could come during the next holiday."

"…I see, so that's how you ended up in this mansion."

"Ah, that was a trigger, but it wasn't the direct reason."

<b>

Certainly, receiving that letter made me aware of the Kuon family.

But at that time, I was strongly concerned about my own and my family's safety.

I wouldn't just go to the stronghold of someone whose identity I didn't know just because I received an invitation.

<b>

The reason I decided to come here was, after all…

<b>

"How should I put it? I've been worried about you since you were absent from school for so long. It really bothers me when someone who usually sits next to me isn't there."

<b>

Along with what I heard from Ueshima-san about Kyori's situation at the main house, and the dangerous ritual that Alicia told me about, which was to decide the next head of the family.

Hearing all those things made me want to at least check on her situation; that was the reason I came to this mansion.

<b>

"…So, that's about it. I'm sorry if my answer isn't very clear."

"No, no! …You thought of me like that…"

<b>

For a moment, I thought I heard Kyori's voice tremble, but… for now, I decided to ignore it.

<b>

"Ah, by the way, is there something you want to talk about?"

"Me?"

"I thought you seemed to have a lot on your mind. Maybe talking it out would help you feel better. Of course, if you don't want to touch on it, that's fine too."

<b>

Hiding here and crying alone like this is an action you wouldn't take unless you were really cornered.

…Well, I can mostly guess the reason.

<b>

"If that's the case, could you listen to me? It might turn into a pretty long story."

"I understand. I'll listen."

<b>

When I answered that, Kyori took a deep breath and began to speak.

<b>

"For Japanese exorcists, the head of the Kuon family is like their leader. The wealth and power that comes with it are quite significant."

<b>

Considering that they own such a grand mansion and that so many people participate in the ritual to decide the next head, it seems that the "wealth and power" Kyori speaks of is beyond my imagination.

<b>

"Therefore, those born with the qualifications to become the next head of the Kuon family dedicate everything to becoming the head from the time they can understand things."

<b>

This was a story from a world that someone born into a relatively ordinary family could hardly comprehend.

From a young age, they are expected to make a resolution, or rather, they are forced to.

I couldn't imagine being able to do that, and in fact, I was inwardly relieved that I wasn't born into such a family.

<b>

"I was made to study techniques and the appropriate conduct for the head of the Kuon family, and I was forced to fight youkai to build my achievements. There were times I almost died because of it. Naturally, I wasn't allowed to do anything childlike. But that was the norm for someone born into the Kuon family."

<b>

It's insane. That's the only way I could think of it.

Educating a successor born into a prestigious family to become a suitable person is a common story.

But to strip your child of all freedom and make them fight dangerous beasts crosses the line into abuse.

<b>

"Didn't Kyori's parents think anything of that…?"

"They believed from the bottom of their hearts that it was my natural duty. Until their last breath."

"That means…"

"My father and mother are no longer here. The only ones around me were shikigami without ego or emotion, faithfully carrying out my late parents' orders to raise me as the next head, and adults scheming to gain benefits by making me the head."

<b>

From her words, I could sense a strong feeling of grief and regret.

<b>

"I wasn't allowed to live like a normal child, studying and training as told by the shikigami, entertaining relatives who approached me with fake smiles just to devour the benefits. As those days continued, I gradually began to give up on everything. I couldn't obtain ordinary happiness. So, I thought I would suppress my emotions and live like a doll."

<b>

From the time I could understand, I was not seen as a person but merely as a candidate for the Kuon family's successor, with others deciding my life without my consent.

That was undoubtedly hell.

<b>

"But after entering that high school and meeting you and everyone, those days were truly refreshing and wonderful for me. I could be seen as a person. I was treated as a human being. That made me really, really happy… so I guess that's why I ran away to a place like this."

<b>

After saying that, Kyori wiped away the tears that had gathered at the corners of her eyes and forced a smile as she stood up.

<b>

"Thank you for listening to my boring complaints. I'm okay now, so—"

"What will happen from now on?"

"…I'll probably quit school and live a life similar to the past in this mansion. But as I said earlier, I'm okay now. I had already accepted that this would happen."

"…Is that what Kyori wants to do?"

<b>

When I asked that, Kyori stopped in her tracks.

I couldn't shake the feeling that she was seeking a normal school life with friends and days where she could live as an individual.

<b>

"…That's not true at all! I want to spend time with everyone, with you, Iori-kun, just like before! But as the successor of the Kuon family, I shouldn't be saying such selfish things…!"

<b>

Kyori turned to me and finally revealed her true feelings.

<b>

"Isn't it okay? Kyori is a human, not a doll, so you can do what you want."

<b>

Kyori's eyes widened at my words, and then she asked with a confused expression.

<b>

"Is that really okay? Even if I do something so selfish and willful?"

"You've been tossed around so much. Isn't it fine to turn the tables once or twice? Besides, I don't even think what you're saying is selfish."

<b>

After my response, Kyori looked down, deep in thought, and then eventually lifted her face as if she had made a decision.

<b>

"Please. Free me from this house, from the ties of the Kuon family…!"

"I'll take care of it."

<b>

That response was enough. Now, I just needed to make it happen.

Thinking that, I took Kyori's hand and started walking toward the door that led to the courtyard.
