# Episode 8: I Ended Up Helping Someone 2

"Alright, that's it for today's class. Make sure to complete P23 by tomorrow. Chairperson, give the command."

"Stand up, bow."

"Thank you very much."

<b>

The face of our homeroom teacher, famous for being the most passionate teacher in the school, disappears from the screen.

<b>

The next day, I attended the online class as usual.

Perhaps because the midterm exam just ended last week and we had started new lessons, I could feel a relaxed atmosphere among the other students even through the screen.

Except for one person.

<b>

(……Alright)

<b>

On the edge of the screen, the faces of the 26 students enrolled in this class are displayed.

Of course, Fujisawa-san's figure was among them.

<b>

(‘Appraisal’)

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Haruna Fujisawa, Human, 14 years old

Condition: Malnutrition, bruising, mood disorder

Notes: Physically and mentally exhausted due to abuse and threats.

<b>

―――

<b>

As expected, the displayed information was unchanged from yesterday.

It’s unfortunate that my wish for it to be some sort of malfunction was shattered, but in that case, I will just do what I can do.

<b>

"Sorry for the sudden message. Do you know a girl named Kana Iori?"

<b>

I switched to a private chat and sent a message to Fujisawa-san.

The read icon appeared immediately, but there was no reply.

Did something happen? Or was it a question she simply didn’t want to answer?

As I pondered these thoughts.

<b>

"Could it be that you’re Kana-chan’s brother, Iori-kun?"

<b>

From the content of this message, it seems that Fujisawa-san didn’t talk to me yesterday because I was "Kana’s brother."

If that’s the case… no, that’s not something to think about right now.

<b>

"Kana is my little sister. I heard about it from her."

"Are you going to that shop again today, Iori-kun?"

"I plan to, at least."

"If it’s okay, could you come at 5 PM? I’ll answer your questions there."

"Got it. Then let’s continue the conversation there."

<b>

After typing that message and ending the chat, I looked at the clock displayed on the edge of my PC.

The current time is 16:27, so there’s about 30 minutes until our promised time.

Then I’ll practice while moving.

<b>

I confirmed the newly listed skills in my "Status" again, then took an eco-bag in hand and left the house.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Sorry for making you wait."

"No, not at all."

<b>

When I arrived at the supermarket, Fujisawa-san was standing in the same spot as yesterday, wearing an apron and holding a bag.

<b>

"…Where should we talk?"

"Could we do it at that bike parking lot over there?"

<b>

Saying that, she pointed to an empty bike parking lot behind the supermarket.

Considering what we were about to discuss, that would be better.

When I nodded, Fujisawa-san looked relieved and headed toward the bike parking lot.

<b>

"So, how’s Kana-chan doing?"

"She’s been feeling down since she heard you quit, Fujisawa-san. It seems she was quite attached to you."

"…I see. I feel bad for Kana-chan."

<b>

To be honest, Fujisawa-san looked apologetic.

<b>

"It’s due to family circumstances, right? It can’t be helped."

"…Yeah, that’s true."

<b>

Saying that as if I didn’t know anything, I watched as Fujisawa-san squeezed out her voice with a downcast expression.

From the results of the "Appraisal," it could be inferred that her home environment is close to terrible.

<b>

"Well, if you run into any trouble, let me know. My sister is worried too."

"Y-Yeah. Thank you."

<b>

When I extended my hand, Fujisawa-san hesitated for a moment but then shook it back.

<b>

"Ah! …Sorry, I have to go soon. Please say hello to Kana-chan for me."

"Yeah, got it."

"Well then, see you tomorrow."

<b>

Just like yesterday, Fujisawa-san seemed to notice something and, looking somewhat frightened, ran off from the spot.

<b>

"…Alright."

<b>

After that, I bought what Kana had asked for and some detergent before heading home.

<b>

"Welcome back!"

<b>

When I entered the living room, Kana was lounging on the sofa, gnawing on a popsicle.

<b>

"I’m back. I just met Fujisawa-san, the one you mentioned yesterday."

"What? No way! You met Fujisawa-senpai!?"

<b>

When I said that, Kana rushed over with genuine surprise.

<b>

"Ah, she said, ‘Please say hello to Kana-chan.’"

"…Was Fujisawa-senpai doing well?"

"She looked a bit tired, but she seemed okay overall."

"I see…"

"Well, I’m going to my room. Is it alright if dinner is fried rice or something?"

"Yeah, that’s fine."

<b>

Not saying any lies or truths, I vaguely conveyed about Fujisawa-san before entering my room.

<b>

"…Now then."

<b>

Sitting on the bed, I activated the skill "Tracking and Detection Magic" that I had acquired yesterday.

The effects of this skill are basically twofold.

The first is the ability to "track" a specified target.

When the skill is activated, a map appears like a 3D display, and the target is shown as a red dot on the map.

The downside is that I can only track things I have touched once.

<b>

The second effect is the ability to "detect" what is around myself or the target.

The downside, like tracking, is that I can only target things I have touched once and that I cannot know the details of what is around it.

However, regarding the latter, I can cover it to some extent with "Appraisal."

<b>

It was worth testing until I fell asleep.

Thinking that, I combined "Appraisal" with tracking Fujisawa-san’s current location and what was around her.

<b>

"………Huh."

<b>

I couldn’t help but voice my surprise at what came up.

I see. No wonder Fujisawa-san looked so tired.

<b>

"…I can’t take too long."

<b>

Muttering that, I began to prepare with a boiling feeling in my gut.
