# Chapter 105: The Preparations for the Cultural Festival Have Begun 8

"I can't eat anymore. I may have ordered too much..."

"I'm full too. I might not need dinner tonight..."

<b>

Since there were two of us, I thought an L-sized teriyaki chicken mayonnaise and a half Napoli mix, along with fried chicken and salad, would be fine, but it seems my expectations were too optimistic.

About half of what we ordered was still left on the table.

I'll put the leftovers in the fridge or freezer and use them for dinner today and breakfast tomorrow.

<b>

"By the way, um, was it really okay? For you to treat me to everything..."

<b>

As I was thinking this, Kyori looked apologetic.

<b>

"Since I've been relying on you so much today, let me at least do this much."

"If Shu-kun says so..."

<b>

Well, the study session is progressing faster than expected, and this seems like a good point to pause.

In that case, it would be a good time to talk about Ikoma-senpai.

<b>

"...Kyori, I have something serious to discuss. It's about your safety."

"My safety...? Understood. Please tell me."

"...Ikoma-senpai, the president of the literature club you're in, might be an ability user."

"...Huh?"

<b>

Kyori showed a perplexed expression at my words.

At least, she has been in contact with Ikoma-senpai for a much longer time than I have.

The fact that she reacts this way suggests she didn't know Ikoma-senpai was an ability user.

<b>

"Since you're telling me this, you must have some basis for it. Can you share that with me?"

<b>

However, Kyori quickly regained her composure and asked back with a serious expression.

<b>

"First, on the day we first went to school together, Ikoma-senpai was surrounded by delinquents, and I helped her, but not a single person, including the police officer at the nearby station, reacted to it at all."

"That happened that day...? I'm sorry, if I had been a little closer to Shu-kun—"

"It's not something you should worry about. Besides, considering Ikoma-senpai's ability, you might not have been able to get involved."

"Ikoma-senpai's ability?"

<b>

I took a breath and seriously explained the ridiculous effect of the ability that anyone might think of when they hear about superpowers or special abilities.

<b>

"She can 'make her delusions a reality.' That's the effect of Ikoma-senpai's ability."

"...Do you have any proof of that effect?"

"That afternoon, you sent me a message and went to the clubroom building, right? At that time, Ikoma-senpai consulted me directly. She said that since summer vacation started, her power began to manifest, and she couldn't control it."

"She can't control her ability...? So, it means we don't know when it might go off?"

"There's also the possibility that someone else is activating an ability that makes Ikoma-senpai's delusions a reality, but in any case, I think it's a dangerous situation."

<b>

Saying that, I took a sip of the oolong tea I ordered with the pizza to soothe my throat.

<b>

"I've done what I can for now, but honestly, I don't have confidence in handling things during the preparation period or on the day of the cultural festival. I'm an outsider, so I can't enter the clubroom building during the preparation period, and on the day itself, many people will come from outside, making it even harder to handle."

"Then, should we have Shu-kun join the club...? Oh, but joining during the preparation period is strictly prohibited, right?"

"Exactly. So, I can't think of any means to suppress the potential outburst during that period."

"That's true... Also, it seems Ikoma-senpai has a hard time with men because of being bullied in elementary school, so having Shu-kun stick close might actually increase the risk of an outburst."

<b>

Being bullied made her uncomfortable around men... Now that I think about it, she seemed quite tense when we were talking in the clubroom.

But if that's the case, why did she approach me, a guy, to discuss her worries?

If she knew I was also an ability user, it wouldn't be so strange, but if she didn't, it seems more natural to consult with friends or someone else.

No, I'll put that line of thought aside for now.

What I need to prioritize is how to deal with an outburst.

<b>

"Just to confirm, is Ikoma-senpai going to school on the day of the cultural festival?"

"I've heard that the heads of each club and the presidents of the clubs must attend without exception."

"Then, we have no choice but to keep someone around her who won't stress Ikoma-senpai and won't make others feel uncomfortable. But where can we find such a convenient person—"

<b>

As I was about to give up and look up at the sky, I suddenly noticed my home's mailbox in my line of sight.

Then, the next thing that came to mind was the black-clad female shikigami sent from the Kuon family to deliver the invitation, who handles household chores and moves naturally like a human.

<b>

Could this be...?

<b>

"Is something wrong, Shu-kun?"

"Hey, the household chores and errands at the Kuon family mansion are basically done by shikigami, right?"

"Um, yes. What about it?"

"What if we use that shikigami to dress up as a female student from our school, specifically a member of the literature club, and have her stay close to Ikoma-senpai? It might feel a bit wrong to deceive her like that, but it could reduce the number of people affected by an outburst."

"Shikigami, huh..."

<b>

After hearing my proposal, Kyori fell silent.

<b>

"Is it really impossible...?"

"No, I think the idea of applying shikigami is valid. The problem is that it's impossible to prepare a shikigami that can mimic the movements of a high school girl from now on."

<b>

...Mimic?

As I was puzzled by Kyori's words, she took out a talisman from her pocket.

Then, as Kyori infused it with power, the talisman transformed into a cute fox-shaped shikigami.

The fox-shaped shikigami yawned and moved quietly to Kyori's lap, curling up and falling asleep there as if it were a real animal.

<b>

"Shikigami are created by recording the movements and behaviors of physically excellent individuals or animals with special tools, and only when this is done can the basic form be completed. The movements of this shikigami mimic those of a real fox, which is one of the records inscribed in the basic technique. By layering additional techniques tailored to the purpose on top of that basic technique, we can finally achieve modifications in appearance, granting abilities, and so on."

<b>

Recording movements and behaviors with special tools and reproducing them with techniques... Is it something like motion capture?

<b>

"So, to realize my idea, I need to persuade a high school girl who would leave a good impression on Ikoma-senpai and record her movements with that special tool, right?"

"That's correct. Moreover, the recording process would take at least six months. If we start now, we won't make it in time for the cultural festival."

"Creating a shikigami takes that much effort... When I think about it, the Kuon family, which had enough shikigami to handle all the household chores, was quite impressive..."

"I think there are very few families that can prepare that many shikigami. However, it's not as difficult as you might think."

"Oh, really?"

"...It seems it would be faster to show you through practice."

<b>

Saying that, Kyori returned the fox shikigami to a paper talisman and placed it on the table, then cut a piece from the notebook she had been using for test preparation and arranged it next to it.

<b>

Then Kyori traced her finger over the characters inscribed on the talisman containing the shikigami.

As she did so, a pentagram with different intricate patterns inscribed on it floated in the air.

Kyori pinched the lowest pentagram and placed it on the piece of notebook paper, then began tracing the pentagram and the central emblem with her finger.

<b>

"Oh..."

<b>

As a result, what had just been a piece of notebook paper began to emit a soft light, and the same emblem that Kyori had pinched was instantly inscribed on it.

Finally, when Kyori infused power into the piece of paper, it transformed into a fox that looked exactly like the one summoned from the talisman.

The summoned fox-shaped shikigami moved naturally like a real animal, just like the one summoned before.

<b>

"Indeed, creating a basic shikigami from scratch is very challenging. However, once completed, you can replicate it as many times as you want."

"So, the shikigami doing chores at the mansion are replicas?"

"That's correct. However, to avoid it being creepy, we modify their appearance and voice."

"I see..."

"By the way, this fox's basic technique is also a replica of one created a long time ago."

"Oh, so there's no degradation in the basic technique. When I think about it, that's incredibly convenient."

"Yes. That's why most exorcists first learn the techniques for replicating shikigami and the techniques for subjugation."

<b>

Wow, shikigami are more convenient than I thought.

...Well, I can't use them this time, though.

Right now, it seems like I won't find an answer by thinking any further, so I should return to the study session.

<b>

"Sorry for taking your time. Shall we get back to studying?"

"No, thank you for the warning. I'll also think of some good ideas."

<b>

Before that, I need to clean up the table.

<b>

"Kyori, could you bring me the plate with the fried chicken on it?"

"Understood."

<b>

As Kyori was about to hand me the plate with the leftover fried chicken, the newly summoned fox shikigami tried to leap onto her arm as if to play a prank.

Kyori quickly returned the fox shikigami to the paper talisman, but it seems she got her finger slightly scratched by its claws.

I quickly activated "Healing Magic" on Kyori and rushed to her side.

<b>

"Ugh..."

"Are you okay?"

"I just got scratched a little, so I'm fine. I'm sorry, though. I didn't mean to cause you trouble..."

<b>

Kyori returned the copied fox to the piece of notebook paper, looking apologetic as she bowed her head to me.

<b>

"Don't worry about it. But it's surprising that they can be a nuisance to their master like that."

"That shikigami was only composed of the basic technique. If the subjugation technique isn't applied, it only mimics the records of the basic technique."

<b>

The subjugation technique, which was briefly mentioned in the explanation of the first shikigami.

<b>

"You mentioned earlier that the subjugation technique is what exactly?"

"It's a technique that makes special dolls, such as shikigami, recognize the user as their master and obey their commands."

<b>

Dolls. Hearing Kyori's words, something briefly comes to mind, but it quickly dissipates.

<b>

"Is something wrong?"

"Oh, no, it's nothing. By the way, can I have the copied shikigami? I want to use it for research."

"That's fine. In that case, I'll also apply the 'Subjugation Technique' just in case."

"Please do."

<b>

Saying that, Kyori took out the talisman again and summoned the pentagram and emblem, inscribing the same thing onto the paper containing the copied shikigami.

<b>

(Hmm, I feel like I'm almost grasping something...)

<b>

Watching that scene, I felt a sensation like a small fishbone caught in my throat.

However, I still couldn't think of a way to pull it out.

I really feel like I'm just a little bit away from figuring it out...

<b>

"Shu-kun, it's done."

"Oh, thank you. Well then, let's officially resume our test preparation."

"Yes!"

<b>

With that, we finished cleaning up and returned to our test studying.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Thank you so much for taking me all the way to the station."

"I can't let anything happen to my important girlfriend. This much is only natural."

<b>

The time was 5:50 PM.

Since it was the time my sister was returning from the dojo, I wrapped up the study session and took Kyori to the station.

<b>

Since we don't know where or in what form an ability outburst might occur, it's better to be cautious.

<b>

"See you tomorrow."

"Yeah, see you."

<b>

After watching Kyori enter the station, I turned to head home.

At that moment, I caught sight of a commercial featuring a popular impersonator on the street vision of the station front building.

Normally, I would have ignored it, but for some reason, that moment caught my attention.

<b>

(Impersonation, mimicry, replication, and dolls... Oh!)

<b>

Hearing Kyori's word "doll," what I had almost thought of crystallized into a clear form through the word "mimicry" that came to mind from the impersonation.

<b>

(Could this possibly work?)

<b>

<b>

In that case, I can't just stand around here doing nothing.

Feeling the exhilaration of finally finding the last piece to complete the puzzle, I quickly moved to a nearby alley and activated "Spatial Transfer Magic."
