# Episode 63: I Ended Up Playing the Heel 3

(“Dispel”)

<b>

I activated my skill on Alicia's subordinate, who was disguised as the female middle school student who was the victim and scouting target this time, and she was also released from the brainwashing state.

The mechanism that misleads them into thinking the brainwashing state continues due to the "Recognition Obstruction Magic" is also functioning.

Additionally, I have confirmed that the hero suit does not currently respond to the "Recognition Obstruction Magic."

The surveillance devices created by "Water Magic" that I had scattered throughout the aerial fortress—most of which were destroyed after the last intrusion—have not detected any abnormal movements.

<b>

I made eye contact with Alicia and approached her subordinate with as wicked a smile as I could muster.

<b>

From here on, it’s an improvised performance without a script, but whether it’s fortunate or not, I managed to obtain reference materials just a moment ago.

<b>

Then I have no choice but to brace myself and do this.

<b>

“Hey, we’re in a money bind. So could you sell it to us for just 10,000?”

<b>

According to Alicia, the roles of the perpetrator and the victim should act as if they have been bullying each other for a long time, even if they have no actual contact.

Taking that into account, the script that Alicia, her subordinate pretending to be the victim, and I came up with was a cliché extortion.

<b>

“... I-I’m sorry. I don’t have that kind of money right now…”

“What? You think you have the right to refuse?”

“Ugh!? I-I’m sorry!”

<b>

Unlike my mediocre acting, the exchange between Alicia and her subordinate was so convincing that I couldn’t help but feel, “Shouldn’t someone step in to stop this?”

<b>

As I was impressed by the skills of agents from a national secret organization.

<b>

“Enough, you villains!”

<b>

Suddenly, such a voice echoed above us.

Looking up at the sky, I saw a suspicious figure in a hero suit designed to resemble a tiger, all in yellow.

<b>

“I cannot allow your misdeeds! In the name of the sacred hero, this ‘Lightning Tiger’ will deliver punishment!”

<b>

While the hero in the Lightning Tiger suit was making his declaration, I gathered the jamming drones that I had generated with "Water Magic" and scattered around the town to indiscriminately apply "Recognition Obstruction Magic."

<b>

Then, after conducting "Sensory Sharing" with the surveillance drones I had positioned higher up and confirming the direction the hero suit was coming from, I sent another hand signal to Alicia.

<b>

“---Tremble in fear before this holy and powerful strike granted by ---! Take this, [Rising---”

“---Sorry. Could you be quiet for a moment?”

<b>

Having confirmed all the setups, I put the "Lightning Tiger" to sleep with "Recognition Obstruction Magic" while he was leisurely reciting his speech.

<b>

Now, all the preparations are complete.

<b>

I disassembled and reassembled the jamming drones like during the school camp using "Sensory Sharing" and deployed a massive aerial cannon.

<b>

“Well then, shall we do this?”

<b>

At my question, Alicia and her subordinate nodded.

After confirming that, I aligned the camera attached to the aerial cannon with "Sensory Sharing" and aimed, then――.

<b>

“---!”

<b>

The moment the cannonball was fired, I saw a light as if something exploded above the clouds.

The source of the light slowly fell toward the sea as planned.

<b>

“Alright, I’ll go catch the mastermind, so you take care of things here.”

“... Yes. I wish you good fortune.”

<b>

With that exchange, I "teleported" into the aerial fortress, which was likely on fire.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

――The memory of a man who was once a hero.

<b>

“Damn it! I got beaten to it again today!”

<b>

As soon as the report came in that "Lightning Tiger" had arrived at the rescue target, all the heroes gathered at the exit of the storage in the base, including me, were disheartened.

<b>

Recently, the "Super Rescue Squad The Hero" had been acting strangely.

<b>

A few days ago, a shock that reverberated throughout the base hit, and since then, the veteran heroes, including the de facto top executive "Doctor The White," had not shown themselves.

The only words from the "Brave One" regarding these abnormal situations were simply, “Continue activities as usual,” that was all.

<b>

However, with the loss of those who were the leaders of each hero faction, the atmosphere within the base had become extremely tense.

<b>

To put it bluntly, what had been our outlet for frustration was the eradication of villains.

<b>

“Haah…”

<b>

Since I had been beaten to it by "Lightning Tiger," there was no reason to stay here.

With a sigh, I turned back toward my room.

<b>

“Hey, hey? Did you hear something?”

<b>

At that moment, a pink hero equipped with large rabbit-like ears, who I believe was named "Pink Hop Rabbit," murmured anxiously.

<b>

“Come on, are you trying to pull a fast one on us with such nonsense?”

“No, that’s not it! I really heard some strange noise!”

<b>

Naturally, no one, including me, paid any attention to Pink Hop Rabbit’s ramblings.

Right now, what we needed to be most cautious about was how quickly we could reach the exit when the next deployment order was given.

<b>

(What a waste…)

<b>

Ignoring the still-yelling Pink Hop Rabbit, I tried to head back to my room to recover some stamina when――.

<b>

“Whoa!?”

“What the hell is this!?”

<b>

Suddenly, the entire base, including this storage, tilted sharply to the right.

While all the heroes were in a state of panic, I looked in the direction the vibrations were coming from with my specialized equipment, the "Hyper Scanning Eye."

<b>

“What the hell… is this?”

<b>

I quickly understood the cause of the shock.

The second storage facility, which had been constructed adjacent to this storage, was completely obliterated, including the engine.

At the same time, I realized the reason for the tilt.

<b>

This base was falling toward the sea.

In just a few minutes, we would likely be plunging into the ocean along with the base.

<b>

However, more than the fear of drowning, what shook me was the fact that someone had destroyed the neighboring storage facility.

<b>

Everything created by the Brave One was perfect.

It was unlikely that the construction robots working on the storage would suddenly explode.

Moreover, I didn’t know the details, but this base was said to navigate under a precise program to avoid collisions with passenger planes and such.

And most importantly, this base was cloaked, making it imperceptible to anyone other than heroes.

<b>

Yet, despite that, the enemy had pinpointed and targeted the second storage facility, which was the base's greatest weakness.

<b>

(Still, I have to fight...)

<b>

I somehow mustered my courage and gripped the specialized weapon bow and arrow, remaining on guard against an enemy whose origin was unknown.

<b>

...However.

<b>

“Ahhh!?”

“Whoa!?”

<b>

Now, the wall of this first storage was destroyed by some high-speed object, filling the area with smoke.

<b>

But I had the "Hyper Scanning Eye!"

Thinking that, I looked for the enemy that was likely hidden in the smoke, only to realize that my actions had been reckless.

<b>

What was in the smoke appeared to be an ordinary man of average height dressed casually.

However, this base was at an altitude of 20,000 meters. One would surely meet death in such attire.

Yet that man moved as if nothing was different from being on the ground.

<b>

And what was most terrifying was the man's face and skin.

Every exposed part of him looked as if it were pixelated.

I couldn’t tell if it was actually like that or if my own self-defense instincts were preventing me from looking directly at him, but one thing was certain: that man was truly a demon.

<b>

“Eek!?”

<b>

I had to run away; I thought so and tried to start running, but it was already too late.

<b>

“…”

<b>

The man looked up at the ceiling as if searching for something, then took a crouching start position while looking at the wall of the storage.

...Then he ran toward the wall and performed a wall kick with his bare body.

<b>

“Gah!?”

<b>

The shockwave generated by that was tremendous, and my body was violently slammed against the opposite wall.

<b>

And with that, my consciousness completely faded away.
