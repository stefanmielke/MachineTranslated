# Episode 20: After the Monster Extermination 1

――side Kuon Family

<b>

"Did the Ushi-oni get defeated!? Is that for sure!?"

"Y-yes! It's certain that the Ushi-oni's youki has completely vanished!"

<b>

The report of the "Ushi-oni Extermination" that arrived at the Kuon family estate shocked Kuon and the exorcists belonging to his clan.

<b>

The prestigious exorcist family "Kuon," and the duty assigned to one of the candidates for the next head, Kuon Kyōri, the "Ushi-oni Extermination," was something that was considered impossible to achieve under normal circumstances.

<b>

The Ushi-oni is a high-ranking youma that has ravaged Japan since ancient times, and even if the highest-level exorcists of the current era gathered, sealing it would be a monumental task.

<b>

When the news came that the Ushi-oni had escaped from its seal along with its minions, the exorcists were greatly troubled.

The decrease in youma itself, along with the extinction of powerful families, meant that the overall strength of exorcists had significantly declined since the Ushi-oni was sealed.

<b>

Thus, the plan conceived was to deliberately feed someone with immense spiritual power to the Ushi-oni to weaken its activity, and then attempt to seal it during that window.

<b>

And the unfortunate sacrifice chosen for this was Kuon Kyōri, who was among the candidates for the next head but lacked political power and held a weak position.

<b>

She was given false information that "a small demon had escaped," and all responsibility for that area was placed on her, followed by the provision of information about the Ushi-oni and the extermination order, making her the sacrificial lamb.

<b>

That was the plan.

<b>

"So, how did Kyōri defeat the Ushi-oni?"

<b>

The current head of the Kuon family, Kuon Sōgen, casually asked the exorcist who had come to report.

<b>

"W-well, according to Kyōri-sama, it seems that it was actually a collaborator who defeated it..."

"A collaborator?"

"The report only states that. Ah, it seems a response team has just arrived on site...!?"

<b>

Having said that, the young exorcist lost his words upon seeing the image displayed on his tablet.

<b>

"What happened?"

"I-I'm sorry. The image that arrived was... too shocking."

"......Hmm. Can you show that image to us as well?"

"Y-yes!"

<b>

The man placed his tablet on the tatami table.

Upon seeing the image displayed, some felt nauseous, while others suspected it might have been altered.

The image was so shocking that it led them to such thoughts.

<b>

"Is this the Ushi-oni? But what on earth could have split that Ushi-oni, which has such a tough exterior, in half...?"

"Look at this small demon over here. Some were killed by techniques, but most seem to have been knocked off from a height."

<b>

As the elders were enveloped in confusion and shock from the images that had come up, a young man slammed his hand on the table and stood up.

<b>

"Everyone, what we should be considering now is not how the youma was exterminated! What we truly need to think about is how to respond to and punish Kyōri for breaking our absolute principle of [Secrecy]!"

"Y-yes..."

<b>

The elders fell silent at the young man's words.

[Secrecy], that is, not exposing their existence to the public. This was an absolute rule for exorcists.

<b>

"What did Kyōri report about that collaborator!?"

"Well, it just says 'collaborator'..."

"The fact that it wasn't written means she couldn't write it honestly! It's clear that Kuon Kyōri broke [Secrecy]! Grandfather, we should swiftly execute Kuon Kyōri!"

"――Genji"

<b>

The impassioned young man――the foremost candidate for the next head of the Kuon family, Kuon Genji, was solemnly addressed by Sōgen.

<b>

"Indeed, we must adhere to the rules. However, we sometimes need to respond flexibly."

"......What do you mean by that?"

"There are likely only two people in the world with such skill and a cooperative attitude towards us. What we should be considering now is how to build a friendly relationship with Kyōri's collaborator."

"Does that mean we will overlook Kyōri's actions?"

"We will monitor this so-called collaborator, and that will serve as Kyōri's punishment."

<b>

After saying this to Genji, Kuon Sōgen, supported by a shikigami, slowly stood up and left the room.

Everyone gathered there stood up to see him off, and Genji exited the corridor with an irritated expression.

<b>

(Damn, damn, damn! That raccoon old man and that damn girl!)

<b>

To Genji, Kyōri was a girl who irritated him to no end.

<b>

She was a top-tier exorcist in both looks and lineage, and there should be no one else but himself who could possess her.

Thinking this, Genji had given Kyōri an order a year ago.

<b>

"Discard your title as a candidate for the next head and become mine. If you do, I'll pamper you as much as you want."

<b>

In response to Genji's words, Kyōri had replied with a composed attitude.

<b>

"I will decide my own life. I have no intention of being directed by you. Please take your leave."

<b>

With those words, Genji, who had used his noble bloodline to act tyrannically, felt "humiliation" for the first time in his life.

At the same time, Genji vowed to make Kyōri pay for the humiliation he had suffered.

And the perfect opportunity to fulfill that vow was the recent Ushi-oni incident.

<b>

However, the outcome only served to further irritate Genji.

――Because Kyōri had achieved the greatest accomplishment of exterminating the Ushi-oni.

<b>

(Just wait and see, damn girl. I will make you taste that humiliation for sure...!)

<b>

With his insides boiling with rage, Genji walked down the long corridor.

Unaware that his shadow stretching down the hallway was transforming into something ominous.
