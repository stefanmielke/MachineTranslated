# Episode 18: I Was Asked to Exterminate a Monster 3

――A few minutes ago.

<b>

"Iori-san, it's out! We have a reaction from the Ushi-oni!"

<b>

When I answered the incoming call on my smartphone's app, Kuon’s urgent voice reached my ears.

<b>

"Where is it?"

"It's in the back alley of the shopping district... behind the ■■ hotel!"

<b>

That location was exactly the hotel where I had tried to jump to the rooftop to test my physical abilities just the other day.

In that case, it’s not a distance that requires using 'Spatial Transfer Magic' to move.

<b>

"I'll head there right away as well. Iori-san, let’s meet on-site..."

"No, we don’t have time for that. Kuon, keep tracking it with your shikigami and report back to me immediately."

"Y-yes!"

<b>

Without hanging up, I jumped out of the window and began moving towards the destination, leaping from house to house.

<b>

"! The speed has increased. They are probably using a taxi or something."

"Is that taxi a regular one?"

"…No. Compared to what seems to be the Ushi-oni, I can feel a very faint different aura."

"Understood."

<b>

Then I need to pick up the pace a bit more.

To gain momentum, I activated 'Wind Magic' in time with my jumps.

I thought to myself that this was more like walking in the air than jumping.

<b>

"Kuon, I want to confirm something. Is that white pigeon sticking close to the taxi your shikigami?"

"Y-yes. Wait, have you already caught up!?"

"Hmm, not completely yet. And also..."

<b>

While moving by jumping, I used 'Appraisal' on the shadowy figure visible through the taxi’s window.

<b>

――――

<b>

Inokuchi Tamotsu, Human, 41 years old

Condition: Intoxicated, Under the Influence of Illusion

Notes: Under an illusion spell, he has developed a strong affection for the Ushi-oni.

<b>

――――

――――

<b>

Kijima, Ushi-oni, 1900 years old

Condition: Starving due to a long period of being sealed, currently disguised as a human woman.

Notes: Has lost a stable means of obtaining aura due to the death of 80% of his subordinate demons, causing him to lose his composure.

<b>

――――

――――

<b>

Unnamed, Imp, 500 years old

Condition: Starving due to a long period of being sealed, currently disguised as a human taxi driver by the Ushi-oni's power.

Notes: The target is enslaved to the Ushi-oni.

<b>

――――

<b>

"I have good news and bad news. Which do you want to hear first?"

"…Please start with the good news."

"There's no doubt that the one in that taxi is the Ushi-oni. Also, there's a small imp in the driver's seat."

"…Then what’s the bad news?"

"A human man is sitting with them. They probably intend to make him the first victim."

"…!"

<b>

Based on the appraisal results and the information obtained from that scroll, this man must have been kidnapped by the Ushi-oni.

<b>

"What are you planning to do?"

"I'll distract the Ushi-oni and separate it from him. Kuon, wait at the place where you fought the demons yesterday. I’ll 'transfer' you there. Oh, and from now on, let’s communicate via chat."

"Y-yes!"

<b>

After that, I ended the call and switched my smartphone notifications to vibrate mode.

Now, I could transfer the Ushi-oni at this timing, but then I wouldn’t be able to control the taxi.

If it suddenly starts causing a ruckus inside, that would be troublesome too.

I’ll keep a distance, neither too close nor too far, and observe.

<b>

As I continued the pursuit, the taxi headed into the mountainous area.

Eventually, the taxi stopped in front of an abandoned factory that hadn’t been used in a long time.

The man was forcibly pulled out of the taxi and dragged by another imp that had been hiding inside.

<b>

"Ugh."

<b>

I jumped to the rooftop of the factory and stood by the window that had been installed in the ceiling.

Inside, the woman disguised by the Ushi-oni was reaching out her hand towards the man.

It seems I need to make a move soon.

<b>

"I have arrived at the designated location."

<b>

At that moment, my smartphone vibrated, and upon checking, I saw a message from Kuon saying she had arrived at the destination.

Then it’s time for me to start.

<b>

I checked the condition of the window and determined it was weak enough to kick through, so I deliberately made noise as I stood on the glass.

<b>

"Hmph!"

<b>

Then, with a strong kick, I shattered the glass and flowed into the factory.

<b>

"?!"

<b>

The Ushi-oni instinctively distanced itself from me and hid in the shadows.

However, I could easily catch up to it, so that’s not a problem.

More importantly, right now...

<b>

"W-what is happening now...?!"

<b>

The poor man, who was supposed to be the first victim, was crying out in confusion.

First, I need to calm him down.

<b>

("Recognition Disruption Magic")

"Ah, what...?"

<b>

Using the skill "Recognition Disruption Magic," I made the man believe that "he is being overwhelmed by a strong drowsiness" while simultaneously preventing him from recalling any memories from the past few hours.

The man affected by "Recognition Disruption Magic" began to fall asleep on the factory floor.

He probably won’t freeze to death in this season, but I’ll put a hand warmer in my pocket just in case.

<b>

Now, the presence of the Ushi-oni and its minions is gradually distancing itself from me.

I kicked the ground with force and accelerated to catch up with the Ushi-oni.

<b>

"…!!?"

<b>

The Ushi-oni, shocked that a mere human was catching up to it at super speed, displayed a bewildered expression and attempted to use some kind of power.

<b>

However, before it could do that, I successfully reached out to the Ushi-oni and activated the skill as planned.

<b>

"…'Spatial Transfer Magic'"
