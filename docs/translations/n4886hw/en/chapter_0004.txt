# Episode 3: Back to Daily Life

"Fuh"

<b>

I placed the bag filled with my belongings on the study desk and lay down on the bed in a starfish position.

<b>

"Finally back home..."

<b>

After about two weeks since that accident, I finally received permission to be discharged and returned to my beloved home.

The reason my hospitalization lasted more than twice as long as initially planned is due to various factors, but the main cause was probably the presence of some malicious media and conspiracy theorists gathering around the hospital.

<b>

The police classified that accident as an unfortunate gas explosion, but there were quite a few people who refused to believe that, and they were eager to uncover the truth behind the incident.

Inevitably, their attention was directed toward me, the only survivor.

Fortunately, my face and name were not revealed, but the location of my hospitalization was identified, and I was unable to move freely.

However, as time passed since the accident, people's interest began to wane, and the police assured us that safety had been secured just the day before yesterday, allowing me to return home like this.

<b>

(I really caused trouble for Dad and Kana...)

<b>

Unlike me, who was just holed up in the hospital, the two of them had work and extracurricular activities.

Dad seemed to be quite concerned about transportation, and my sister apparently had to take a break from her lessons.

They both told me, "Don't worry about it," but I still felt guilty.

I should repay this debt soon.

<b>

"…Well then"

<b>

I focused on my usual 'Status'.

Even while I was hospitalized, I diligently used my skills to level up.

By the fifth day, I could sense how much my MP had decreased, so I hardly experienced nausea or drowsiness anymore.

However.

<b>

"Sure enough, the growth has slowed down."

<b>

I reached level 10 just five days ago. It was only three days ago that I leveled up to 11.

Until then, as long as I activated my skills to the limit, I would level up by one the next day, but now that growth has slowed down.

In fact, I feel like I’m not growing at all.

<b>

"Appraisal"

<b>

I attempted to use the skill 'Appraisal' while my status was open.

<b>

―――

Target: Skill 'Appraisal'

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Description: Can appraise the condition and effects of the target object.

Supplement: Cannot gain exp bonus as the skill level has reached its maximum.

<b>

Target: Skill 'Universal Translation'

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Description: Allows immediate understanding of the meanings of all languages and words.

Supplement: Cannot gain exp bonus as the skill level has reached its maximum.

<b>

―――

<b>

I see, this is the reason I can't level up.

It seems that I had been leveling up by gaining exp bonuses from raising my skill levels.

However, since I have completely maxed out those skill levels, it appears I can no longer gain those bonuses.

<b>

In other words, if I want to level up further, I need to learn new skills.

<b>

I lightly touched the SP section displayed in the status list.

Then, a list of skills appeared overlapping the status.

<b>

―――

…

……

………

Fire Magic: Required SP 10

Ice Magic: Required SP 10

Wind Magic: Required SP 5

Water Magic: Required SP 5

Earth Magic: Required SP 5

………

……

<b>

I had understood quite some time ago that the SP displayed in the status was necessary for acquiring skills.

The problem is that I don't know what effects those skills have until I actually acquire them.

For example, I can imagine that 'Fire Magic' would allow me to freely produce flames, but I have no idea what effects 'Substitution Magic' or 'Dark Magic' would have.

Above all, the biggest issue is that I don't know how much MP is required to activate those skills.

<b>

…To be honest, I don't really need to level up any further.

Thanks to 'Universal Translation', I can almost automatically understand foreign languages, and with my increased stats, I hardly get tired in daily life anymore.

I've already received enough benefits, so I shouldn't have to worry about choosing skills.

Yet here I am, troubled by a single skill.

<b>

"…Maybe there's no special reason for it."

<b>

I simply want to level up. I want to get stronger by leveling up. The reason I’m fixated on it is probably just that simple.

<b>

I decided to learn 'Water Magic', 'Wind Magic', and 'Space Transfer Magic' and then checked my status again.

<b>

<b>

Now, which skill should I check first?

Water Magic seems the safest, but there's a risk of flooding the room like a water spout.

Even with Wind Magic, I want to avoid a situation where the room becomes a mess due to strong winds.

<b>

That leaves only Space Transfer Magic as an option, but...

<b>

"Appraisal"

<b>

―――

Target: Skill 'Space Transfer Magic'

Effect: Can transfer the target object to the location imagined by the user.

Status: Skill Level 1/10

Supplement:

<b>

<b>

"Please tell me I won't get stuck in a wall..."

<b>

Space Transfer, likely a magic that allows teleportation, but the problem is that I won't know the destination until I try it, and I also don't know how much MP it will require.

<b>

"For now, let's give this a try."

<b>

I took an empty plastic bottle that had contained a sports drink I bought from the hospital vending machine before being discharged.

First, I'll see if I can transfer this into the trash can in my room.

<b>

"Space Transfer"

<b>

As I activated the skill, the plastic bottle in my hand vanished.

At the same time, a strong sense of fatigue and drowsiness hit me.

<b>

"S-Status..."

<b>

Over 100 MP was taken away in one go. This is definitely not something I can use casually...

After confirming that, I finally lost consciousness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Confirmed use of high-level skills under extreme conditions."
