# Chapter 109: The Cultural Festival Has Begun 1

Happy New Year!

I look forward to your continued support this year as well.

----------------

<b>

"Good morning, Kyori."

"Good morning, Shu-kun."

<b>

On the morning of the cultural festival, we met in our uniforms at the usual park, both without our bags, and exchanged light greetings.

<b>

Despite the cultural festival we had both been looking forward to finally starting, Kyori's expression was dark.

<b>

"Did you not manage to get in touch with Ikoma-senpai after all?"

"…Yes. Even though I sent a message, it hasn’t been read, and I can't tell if the phone is off or if I'm being blocked, but I can't get through."

<b>

Two days ago, all contact with Ikoma-senpai had ceased.

Until then, we had been having casual conversations about abilities and promoting our favorites, and I thought our relationship was going smoothly, especially compared to the close bond she had with Ibara...

Moreover, for some reason, she was not being caught by any tracking or detection magic.

This should definitely be seen as an abnormal situation.

…However.

<b>

"For now, I've sent Ibara to Ikoma-senpai's house, so we can only wait for that report."

"…I see. I hope nothing has happened to Ikoma-senpai."

<b>

…Even though there is hardly anything we can do, this dark and gloomy state is not good.

I took Kyori's hand to change the heavy atmosphere and said.

<b>

"Shu-kun…?"

"I'll say it again, but all we can do now is wait for a report from Ibara. So until then, let's enjoy the cultural festival as much as we can."

"…You're right. It's a special cultural festival, so we should enjoy it as much as we can."

<b>

Feeling relieved that Kyori had finally returned to her usual demeanor, we started walking toward the station.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Wow, this is amazing…"

<b>

As soon as we arrived at the school, I couldn't help but exclaim at the brightly decorated school building.

Stalls lined the playground and parking lot, and the school itself was adorned with banners and balloons, making it colorful, while students walked around in extravagant costumes.

<b>

"It's incredible. Everyone looks like they're having so much fun… it really feels like a festival."

"Yeah. It's my first time participating in such an event, but I didn't expect it to be this extravagant…"

<b>

As I voiced my admiration again, Kyori tilted her head.

<b>

"Shu-kun, have you never participated in such events before?"

"Yeah, my parents were transferred until recently, so I couldn't attend cultural festivals or sports days because we were busy preparing to move."

"So you haven't lived in this town for long?"

"Um, I've been here for about two years now, I think?"

"I see. That's a bit surprising. You seemed to get along well with everyone in class."

"That's just because I often hang out with Rentaro; I'm actually quite an introvert."

"What does introvert mean?"

"…It's something you'll probably never have to deal with."

"???"

<b>

While we were having such lighthearted chatter, we arrived at the hot dog stall run by the third-year students.

The hot dog, a fail-safe flavor with the convenience of being eaten with one hand, had attracted quite a line in front of the stall.

<b>

Normally, I would skip a place with such a long line, but…

<b>

"…!"

<b>

Seeing Kyori's face light up as she watched the sausages being grilled, just like when we ordered pizza during the study session, I couldn't just ignore it.

<b>

"What do you want to do? It looks like we'll have to wait a while."

"…Um, if possible, I'd like to wait."

"Okay, then let's line up."

"Yes!"

<b>

When I replied like that, Kyori nodded with a pleasant smile.

That said, the third-year staff were working efficiently, but at this rate, it might take about 10 to 15 minutes.

Well, we can just chat while we wait.

…Oh, speaking of which.

<b>

"Can I ask a really late question? What year and class is Ikoma-senpai in?"

"…I think she’s in 2-B."

"2-B…"

<b>

It’s probably just a coincidence, but knowing that she is in the same class as the one involved in that incident stirred up some indescribable emotions within me.

<b>

"Um, did something happen?"

"Oh, no, it’s nothing. More importantly, let’s move ahead since it’s our turn."

<b>

As I was thinking about that, Kyori peeked at my face with a worried expression.

I messed up; did I make a face that worried her that much?

<b>

Feeling a bit regretful inside, I chatted with Kyori about trivial things while we waited in line until we finally bought our hot dogs.

A simple, ordinary hot dog made by placing a sausage in a commercial bun and adding store-bought ketchup and mustard.

It’s something that could easily be made at home if one wanted to.

<b>

(No matter the ingredients or skills, food at events like this is usually delicious.)

<b>

As I took a bite of the hot dog wrapped in aluminum foil, I thought that wholeheartedly.

<b>

"It's delicious… this is really good!"

<b>

Kyori seemed very satisfied as well, eagerly devouring her hot dog.

<b>

Seeing Kyori like that made me feel that "just seeing this made it worth coming here," and I took out the cultural festival pamphlet from my pocket.

Now, where should we go next? As I looked through it, a stall on the second floor of the school caught my eye.

<b>

"Shu-kun, where are we going next?"

"If you're okay with it, I'd like to check out the haunted house stall run by 2-B."

"…Is that also to investigate Ikoma-senpai's abilities?"

"That's part of it, but my main goal is to learn about Ikoma-senpai's relationships."

"Relationships?"

"How she is perceived in class. How she spends her time. I want to know if that relates to her ability's outbursts. Opportunities to visit a senpai's classroom are rare, so I thought it would be good to check it out. Is that okay?"

<b>

It might be odd for me to say, but the fact that Kyori and I started dating caused quite a stir throughout the school.

Yet, according to Ibara’s report, it seemed that Ikoma-senpai “didn’t know” about it.

Given that she is a junior in the same club, it’s safe to say that "Ikoma-senpai simply wasn’t interested in such topics" is highly unlikely.

That leaves the possibility that there was no one around to inform her.

Whether that stems from poor social skills or if she is isolated in class due to bullying.

I wanted to confirm such things and understand the stress Ikoma-senpai faces in her daily life; that was my objective.

<b>

"I understand. Then let’s head there right away."

<b>

Having finished her hot dog, Kyori nodded in agreement after hearing my explanation.

So we started walking toward our next destination, the haunted house in 2-B.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

―――At the same time.

<b>

"I think it was around here."

<b>

Following the orders of Iori Shu, Ibara had come to the apartment where Ikoma Juri lived.

The apartment was equipped with an auto-lock system, preventing outsiders from entering through the entrance, but…

<b>

"This is no problem at all."

<b>

Using the abilities of "Design" and "Blacksmithing," Ibara created a tool to unlock the auto-lock and boldly entered the building.

Without encountering any significant obstacles, Ibara made her way to Ikoma Juri's room.

Then, she created another key to enter the room.

<b>

"This is…"

<b>

Ikoma Juri's living space was completely vacant.

If that were all, one might simply think that the resident had gone out.

The problem was that there had been clear signs of life just moments before.

<b>

The coffee poured into the teacup on the table and the toast, likely from breakfast, were still steaming, and the television and air conditioning were still on, with the wallet and smartphone left inside.

It truly seemed as if the resident of this room had vanished suddenly.

<b>

Ibara searched the room thoroughly for any traces of Ikoma Juri but found nothing but empty results.

Staying here any longer would be meaningless.

Ibara's thought process reached that conclusion and she attempted to report this to her master, Iori Shu, but…

<b>

"…I can't get through?"

<b>

First, she tried to connect their thought processes using "Sensory Sharing," but for some reason, the skill was blocked.

Next, she attempted to call, but only an "automated message" played, with no sign of connection.

Finally, she used "Tracking and Detection Magic" to find out where her masters were, but…

<b>

"I can't connect here either?"

<b>

Iori Shu had vanished suddenly, just like the resident of this room.
