# Episode 115: The End of Becoming 2

On the night of the accident at the cultural festival, I, Ikoma Juri, was admitted to the hospital for tests.

I don't know what kind of accident it was, but it seems that many teachers and students besides me are also hospitalized in this hospital.

However, what I was concerned about was something completely different.

<b>

"You don't have the luxury to play around. If you understand, hurry up and study."

<b>

The last time I met my mother, she told me that and said I should study instead of going to the cultural festival.

I feel sorry for Kyori-chan, but I have to skip the cultural festival and study as my mother told me to.

That was the last memory I have of sitting at my desk.

<b>

Yet for some reason, I was heading to the school's cultural festival, got caught up in an accident, lost consciousness, and now here I am lying in a hospital bed.

I can't remember at all how this happened or why I even went to school in the first place.

<b>

For now, I should look up information about the accident on my smartphone. Thinking that, I felt a slight headache but managed to sit up, only to realize belatedly that my mother had confiscated my smartphone, and I sighed.

<b>

If I'm hospitalized like this, my mother probably knows about it.

That means I can easily imagine her scolding me for not following her orders and going to the cultural festival.

...No matter how much I try to explain myself, I don't think my mother will listen.

So this time, to avoid feeling more scared and suffering, I just have to keep apologizing and wait for her anger to subside――.

<b>

(Is that really okay?)

<b>

As I thought that, such a thought suddenly crossed my mind.

No matter how I look at it, it's definitely better to do as my mother says without rebelling against her. It should be that way, yet...

<b>

――Someone I saw in my dream, who bravely faced a terrifying enemy and fought desperately to help me.

Recalling that made me feel a conflict about whether this was really okay.

<b>

I know it's foolish.

Just because I saw something like that in a dream, I want to fight like that person? It's way too foolish and reckless.

Still...

<b>

(...It's better to regret doing something than to regret not doing it, right?)

<b>

As I was thinking that, the door to my hospital room swung open vigorously.

<b>

"Juri!"

<b>

The person who appeared—my mother, Ikoma Sanae, shouted as she approached me after seeing my face.

Seeing that, I instinctively covered my face with my arm, thinking I might get hit.

<b>

However, the expected pain did not come, and the first thing I felt was the scent of my mother's perfume and the sensation of her tightly embracing me.

<b>

"I'm so sorry...! I'm really sorry...! I pushed you this far...!"

<b>

My mother hugged me tightly while sobbing.

<b>

――This is something I heard later, but apparently, I had gone to school in a state similar to sleepwalking.

When my mother was informed that I had been transported to the hospital unconscious, she realized strongly that she had pushed me too hard.

<b>

Unaware of such a situation, I, while recognizing it was cowardly, thought that now I could have my will heard, and I mustered the courage to speak.

<b>

"...Mother. I can't become like you. All men are scary, I'm terrible at talking to people, and I don't even want to get back at that person that much."

<b>

My mother just listened to me while holding me.

...Not knowing what kind of expression my mother had right now is really scary. Still, I can't run away here.

Thinking that, I desperately continued my words.

<b>

"So, um... I can't become the person you want me to be. I'm sorry――"

<b>

Before I could finish, my mother pulled me closer and began to speak while occasionally sobbing.

<b>

"You don't have to apologize, Juri. I'm really sorry for not listening to you properly...!"

"Mother..."

<b>

How long has it been since my mother spoke such kind words to me like this?

Thinking about that made tears naturally well up, and I cried. I cried a lot.

Perhaps influenced by that, my mother also cried. It was more than I had ever seen before.

<b>

After that, we talked about what to do from now on.

Without getting emotional, very, very calmly.

<b>

And after the discussion ended, once my mother left the hospital room, I was able to sleep with a clear mind for the first time in a long while.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Well, I guess that's a wrap for now, right?"

"Is that so? I'm glad..."

<b>

The time was 8 PM, and the place was the living room of the apartment where Kyori lived.

After hearing my report, Kyori let out a relieved sigh.

<b>

After that, we returned to the real world and immediately contacted Alicia and the others to resolve the situation.

First, we used the drone, which had restored sensory sharing, to put all students and teachers in the school, except for me and Kyori, to sleep, and implanted false memories in line with the gas leak incident spread by Alicia's organization.

We also altered the memories of the surrounding residents in the same way, and posts on social media were deleted by Alicia and her group, making the disappearance of the school an event that never happened.

<b>

This might be meddling, but I instilled a bit of guilt in those who treated Ikoma-senpai like a mere errand runner, and in addition, I instilled the awareness of taking her words seriously in her mother.

Additionally, to prevent any troublesome situations later, I erased memories about the thorn.

The remaining issue was whether Ikoma-senpai and her mother would reconcile well, but it seems that was resolved too.

I think we can consider the aftermath of this series of events mostly finished.

Well, for the time being, we should continue to be vigilant so we can respond immediately.

<b>

"So, um, what exactly was the cause of the incident this time?"

<b>

Perhaps because we had wrapped things up, Kyori asked me that.

Hearing that, I took out what used to be an Ikai crystal from my pocket and placed it on the living room table.

<b>

"What is this...?"

"This is the root cause of the incident. The mastermind used this to manipulate Ikoma-senpai's thoughts and remotely activate her abilities."

"Is it... safe to touch?"

"Yeah, it's fine. I've removed all the abilities that were placed on it."

<b>

Once I confirmed that, Kyori picked up the crystal from the table and began to examine it.

So this is an Ikai crystal.

Considering it resembles the object from that hero suit incident and what was attached to Ikoma-senpai, I think the person behind that incident and the mastermind of this incident belong to the same person, faction, or organization.

If that's the case, I might need to investigate the hero suit incident again. That means I should contact Alicia too.

Oh, right.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Kyori. I had to cancel the cultural festival."

<b>

Since we made it seem like such a major accident happened, this year's cultural festival was canceled.

I feel really sorry for her, especially since she was looking forward to it so much.

<b>

"N-no, please don't worry about it! Given what happened, it's unavoidable!"

"No, even so, I can't help but feel sorry. Is there anything you want or anything you wish to do? I want to make it up for this incident."

"Make it up...?"

<b>

At my words, Kyori pondered.

...Did I cause her more trouble? Just as that thought crossed my mind.

<b>

"Um, can I ask for one thing?"

"Y-yeah. Anything."

<b>

When I replied like that, Kyori took out her smartphone and operated it, then showed me the screen.

What was displayed was the homepage of an attraction facility near the station that I had been to several times after being invited by Rentaro and the others.

<b>

"I want you to take me here, just the two of us. Is that okay...?"

"Y-yeah...! That’s totally fine!"

"Thank you! Then let's adjust our schedules right away!"

<b>

Kyori's face brightened up, and she began checking her smartphone's calendar.

There were many difficult things, but somehow we managed to bring it to a state that could be called a happy ending.

So now, let's fully enjoy this time alone with Kyori.

<b>

I took out my smartphone to check the calendar while thinking about that.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

―――On the rooftop of a high-rise apartment building not far from the station.

A boy appeared, shivering from the cold.

<b>

"Ugh. It really gets pretty cold at night."

"Then wouldn't it be better to hold the meeting in a warmer place? We've been together for almost two years, but I feel like I hear that line every time this season."

<b>

As the boy muttered that, a shadow formed in the shape of a woman from the light set up on the rooftop and began to move independently.

<b>

"This is the only place where I can talk to you comfortably."

"Don't you have your house?"

"I don't want to be in the same space with those guys all the time."

<b>

As he said that, the boy opened the lid of a warm canned coffee he had apparently bought at a convenience store and poured its contents into his mouth.

<b>

"By the way, are you really okay with giving away two Ikai crystals? You could have used them more meaningfully, right?"

"I told you at the beginning, didn't I? Let's play a game to see which is more interesting to break: a person pushed to the limit or a person completely lost in power. This is an important piece for that."

"......Hmm. I cooperated because I believed it was worth that much, so don't betray my expectations, okay?"

"Of course. I won't let you feel that way."

<b>

The shadowy woman shrugged at the boy's lackluster response.

The boy approached the rooftop railing without reacting to that.

<b>

"More importantly, how's it going over there? I heard the hero's control system has been completed."

"Things are going well. In the recent battle with the Maou army, they used weaklings as shields just as I expected."

"Oh, then I need to step up my pace too."

<b>

The boy's mouth curled into a smile at the report from the shadowy woman.

Seeing the boy's demeanor, the shadowy woman showed some satisfaction and began to return to the boy's shadow.

<b>

"Well then, I'm going home. I'll come back if there's any movement."

"Yeah. See you later, Ashera."

<b>

Once the boy confirmed that the presence of the shadowy woman—Ashera—had disappeared, he finished the contents of the canned coffee and completely incinerated the can with black flames.

<b>

"Now, show me something interesting from here on out, Shu?"

<b>

At that moment, what was in the boy's eyes was undoubtedly pure madness.
