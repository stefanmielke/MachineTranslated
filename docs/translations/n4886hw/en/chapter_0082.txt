# Chapter 78: Invited to the Mansion 6

Inside the false body, a certain device was set up.

When that device was activated, the false body burst like a water balloon, scattering ice fragments covered in slime-like liquid everywhere.

In other words, the mechanism of the false body was a self-destruct device.

With this, even if the enemy discovers its true identity, it can silence them in an instant, and since only water remains at the scene, there is no need for concealment operations.

As a last resort, it could be said to be an unparalleled item.

<b>

That said, while I have praised the self-destruct function of the false body up to this point, there are also considerable drawbacks.

One of them is that once it self-destructs, that false body cannot be reused.

If only an arm or a leg is damaged, it can be repaired as long as there is water nearby, but if the torso, which integrates various functions necessary to operate the false body, is destroyed, there is nothing that can be done.

And what happens if this self-destruct, this last trump card, is used at a half-hearted timing?

<b>

<b>

(……This is how I end up having to go directly.)

<b>

I let out a sigh as I directly observe the figure of the monster, crumpled after having its solar plexus kicked.

The false body and the drones generated from it constantly emit location information. Thanks to that, I was able to use 'Spatial Transfer Magic' to get here, but the problem is how to escape from here.

The connection with the false body has been completely severed, but the drones are still operational.

<b>

"Hey, hey, I got hit by a machete earlier—"

<b>

As I pondered this, Koharu timidly pointed at one of my hands and asked.

<b>

Now that I think about it, I did get hit by something and brushed it off.

Was that the machete thrown by that monster?

I felt no pain at all, so I thought it was just a piece of wood or a prop thrown at me...

<b>

"Well, don't worry about it. Right now, we need to think of a way to safely escape from here."

"Um, I think that door leads to a safe place."

<b>

Saying that, Koharu pointed to a door from which golden light was leaking.

It looked to be several hundred meters away from where we stood.

However, at this distance, there was no need to bother using skills.

<b>

"Eh, eh, eh? W-What do you mean...?"

"Sorry, but be careful not to bite your tongue."

"Wait a minute... kyaaaah!?"

<b>

Confirming that Koharu had tightly clung to my back, I dashed toward the door that led to the exit at full speed.

<b>

'Gya gya!?!'

<b>

Along the way, the stairs that were spread out in all directions suddenly began to move, trying to crush us, but I easily avoided them.

<b>

Considering the distance and speed, as well as the fact that the monster was restrained, we would likely reach our destination in less than ten minutes.

<b>

Just as I thought such carefree thoughts, that very moment occurred.

<b>

'Gya... GugaAAAA?!'

<b>

The monster further distorted its form, tearing apart its restraints with brute force, transforming into a giant that was several times larger than me, at least five meters tall, and with its log-like thick arms, it forcibly pulled out a nearby pillar and hurled it at us with all its might.

<b>

"…!"

<b>

I kicked it away, literally shattering it into pieces, and the monster's filthy eyes turned red with anger――.

<b>

"…Hey, hey, you can do even that?"

<b>

The monster pulled out a nearby pillar from its base and threw it at us.

Initially thrown randomly, it gradually increased its accuracy until it barely grazed the hem of my clothes.

<b>

The drones deployed in this mansion were all specialized for reconnaissance, and their armaments were minimal, making it impossible to protect Koharu.

In the first place, I had no leeway to wait for the drones to arrive while carrying Koharu on my back.

<b>

(Then, it can only be that.)

<b>

Having decided on a course of action by observing the monster's movements, I looked at Koharu, who was desperately clinging to my back.

<b>

"I'm going to do something quite reckless, but can you endure it?"

"I don't care if it's reckless or anything! Just do something about those guys quickly!"

<b>

Hearing Koharu's words, I jumped up vigorously. Then, by slightly shifting my position with 'Spatial Transfer Magic', I deliberately avoided the monster's attack at the last possible moment, as if provoking it.

<b>

'Guu... GAAAAA!!!'

<b>

Perhaps losing its patience, the monster let out a roar and summoned a creature carrying a black wooden box that seemed to be a smaller version of itself, giving it some kind of instruction.

<b>

"You can't use defensive techniques anymore, right?"

"…Yes, that's right. I'm sorry for being weak."

"You don't need to apologize. Just focus on protecting yourself as I mentioned earlier."

"I-I understand."

<b>

Upon hearing Koharu's response, I attached a lifeline created with 'Ice Magic' to the ceiling and used one of the stairs as a foothold to pass right in front of the monster, increasing its stress even further.

<b>

'Gya, GYAaaa!!'

'Gii!'

<b>

What the large monster took out from the wooden box was a gigantic black rock that could easily crush a person, tied to another massive log, essentially a super giant hammer.

<b>

'Gya gya gya gya!'

<b>

The monster, wearing an even more grotesque smile, swung it down toward my head without hesitation.

<b>

Probably, or rather, there is no human who could survive being hit on the head by something like that.

But.

<b>

'Gya gya?'

"…Huh?"

<b>

In the next moment, I heard the bewildered voices of the monster and Koharu.

<b>

The hammer that the monster swung down shattered into pieces upon hitting my head, and the rock that was tied to the giant log also split apart.

<b>

Seeing the monster's dumbfounded face, I took a deep breath and clenched my right fist tightly.

<b>

"Well then, I guess I'll take one hit?"

<b>

Saying that, I poured all my strength into my fist and pierced the monster's face with it.
