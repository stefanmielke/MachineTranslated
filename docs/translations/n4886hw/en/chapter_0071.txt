# Episode 67: Each Ending

―――side Masayoshi Kato

<b>

"Why, why is this happening?!"

<b>

A detention center for ability users set deep in the mountains, far from human settlements.

In one room of that facility, the boy—Masayoshi Kato—was in a half-mad state, repeatedly placing his hand over a cup.

<b>

If he combined his skills, "Blacksmithing Technique" and "Design," that cup in front of him should have been transformed into a tool for escape—at least, that was what he believed.

<b>

Yet, despite spending minutes and hours, the cup remained just a cup.

<b>

"I don't want this, I don't want this! I don't want to go back to being just a mob character!"

<b>

Masayoshi Kato shouted desperately. He continued to scream.

However, no matter how much he screamed, the cup would not change into anything else, and his physical abilities were no different from those of his physical age.

<b>

Even so, he denied it and continued to shout.

He was a special, chosen hero.

<b>

Yet, his anguished cries did not reach anyone's ears, echoing eternally into the void.

―――side Alicia

<b>

"I had to put a lot of effort into spreading the cover story and processing the memories of those involved, but the higher-ups are pleased, saying it was worth the cost."

<b>

In a high-end café near the station, the man in a suit was in a good mood as he popped a seemingly expensive cake into his mouth.

<b>

――Even though he is my direct superior, why do I have to share tea with this man?

The girl agent named Alicia sipped her tea with a displeased expression.

<b>

"Oh, your fork has stopped moving? Don't worry, everything here is on me. Feel free to order as much as you like."

"It's not that... Ah, never mind."

<b>

Alicia gave up her subtle resistance, inserted her fork into the cheesecake, and brought a piece to her mouth.

The taste of the cake, which cost nearly 2000 yen per plate, was undeniable, and Alicia was desperately trying to resist the urge to let her face relax.

Seeing her demeanor, the man in the suit, who called himself Hirata, wore a suspicious smile and finally took out some documents from his bag.

<b>

"First, about Masayoshi Kato. He was believed to be the person who died in that 'gas explosion accident.'"

"…But in reality, he was alive and committing extraordinary crimes using supernatural powers."

"Ah, thanks to that, our 'organization' has been stirred up like a hornet's nest."

<b>

Hirata said this as if it were someone else's problem, then popped the last piece of chocolate cake into his mouth.

<b>

"Then should we change our approach to him, the sole survivor of that 'accident'?"

"No, we should continue to focus on monitoring and protecting him as before."

<b>

After saying that, Hirata called the waiter and ordered another expensive cake.

Alicia turned a blind eye to Hirata's overly laid-back behavior, and opened her mouth.

<b>

"Can you tell me why the status quo was maintained?"

"His power has exceeded what we can handle. That reason should be sufficient, right?"

"…Yes, I suppose so. If an order to 'eliminate him' were issued now, I can easily imagine the organization collapsing and falling apart as we surrender to him."

<b>

Alicia shuddered, perhaps recalling that scene.

Just then, the waiter brought the additional cake Hirata ordered, and he dug in as if he had been waiting for it.

Alicia, exasperated by Hirata's demeanor, tried to calm herself by taking a sip of her tea.

<b>

"Now, let's wrap up the small talk and discuss the main topic."

"!"

<b>

Finally. Alicia straightened her posture and looked at the man calling himself Hirata.

<b>

"The higher-ups are very pleased that we have obtained technology and materials from another world for the first time in history due to this incident. Therefore, it has been decided to promote you to Class 3 Supervisor."

<b>

Hirata politely handed Alicia a translucent card key-like object.

<b>

"With that, you will be able to explore more archives."

"Yes, I will gratefully make use of it."

<b>

After confirming the card key-like object she received, Alicia stood up.

<b>

"If possible, I would appreciate your continued efforts for our country and our organization."

"…I wish to do the same."

<b>

<b>

After saying that, Alicia left the café.

A determined expression, as if she had resolved not to turn back, was on her face.

<b>

―――side Shu Iori

<b>

"Alright, please wash the dishes!"

"Sure thing."

<b>

After finishing dinner, Kana quickly went to her room.

<b>

"Ah…"

<b>

I took a breath and turned on the TV.

<b>

"Next, we will report on the 'Large-Scale Child Abduction Incident.' On the morning of the ■■th, a tanker adrift was discovered by the Coast Guard, and since it did not respond to calls, Coast Guard personnel boarded it and found numerous children inside—"

<b>

The news was covering this incident extensively today as well.

On the internet, it was already treated as a bizarre incident since only children were found inside the tanker, and various conspiracy theories were being whispered.

However, no one could have predicted that the truth behind this incident was that "someone who returned from another world had used skills akin to magic to abduct a large number of children."

<b>

"The cover scenario is already prepared, so you can rampage as you like."

<b>

Alicia had said that before making her move, but honestly, I didn't expect it to be this large-scale.

<b>

…Speaking of which, I have to deal with that too.

<b>

I activated my "Item Box" and took out that "Ikai Crystal."

<b>

"Identification."

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Ikai Crystal

Condition: Good

Note: Extracts magical power from another realm and substitutes it for the MP required to activate the owner's skills. If the crystal is lost, the original owner will be unable to activate their skills, and all previously activated skills will lose their effectiveness.

Current owner: None

<b>

――――

<b>

I thought this would be some important material, so after successfully soft-landing it, I stored it in the "Item Box," but it seems that at the same time, Kato no longer became the owner of this Ikai Crystal.

And troublingly, no one is willing to recognize it as belonging to anyone.

<b>

Alicia told me, "I leave everything to you," but what should I do?

<b>

…It’s meaningless to keep it, and it just unnecessarily occupies space in the "Item Box," so maybe it would be better to just break it here?

<b>

As I stared at the crystal, everything became bothersome, and I laid some tissues on the table, then put some force into it and shattered it into pieces.

<b>

Alright, one of my worries is solved!

Now, I can focus on how to spend the remaining summer vacation without worrying about that crystal!

<b>

Just as I was thinking that and about to head to the kitchen to wash the dishes and my hands.

<b>

"Skills [Blacksmithing Technique] and [Design] have been added to your skill list."

<b>

…Huh?
