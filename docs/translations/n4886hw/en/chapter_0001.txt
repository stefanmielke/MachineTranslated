# Prologue

"Everyone, are you in position?"

<b>

A deserted alleyway at a crossroads.

In a corner of the parking lot beneath a long-abandoned building, a man in work clothes—Vigo—contacted his teammates deployed around the area via an intercom.

<b>

"This is Gabriel, in position."

"This is Garrett, likewise in position."

"Mirror, in a sniping position."

<b>

After confirming everyone's status, the man pulled out the hidden handgun and loaded it with non-lethal rounds.

<b>

"Let's review the operation details again. Our objective is to deliver the target alive to the client. We will incapacitate them with non-lethal rounds or a stun gun and transport the target to the waiting van."

"I understand the operation. But is this level of heavy armament really necessary to abduct a kid without any guards?"

"According to unconfirmed information, a certain country's unit is also after this kid. Don't underestimate it as just a simple kidnapping."

"Still, what value could this kid possibly have? From the background check, he looks like an ordinary Japanese junior high school student."

"Who knows? The client isn't keen on sharing details. Rumor has it that this kid is—"

"Everyone, enough chatter. The target has appeared."

<b>

Everyone's expressions changed at the communication from the sniper positioned on the upper floors of the building.

<b>

"Gabriel and I will proceed first. Garrett and Mirror, stay put."

"Understood."

<b>

After informing his teammates, Vigo carefully closed the distance to the target from the shadows.

<b>

The person who appeared was an ordinary Japanese junior high school boy, wearing a school uniform in the style of a gakuran and holding a supermarket plastic bag in one hand.

His build was neither large nor small, neither fat nor thin—just an entirely average Japanese boy.

<b>

("Hard to believe a kid like this could be worth a billion dollars.")

<b>

While Vigo was thinking about such things, he cautiously closed the distance to the target.

As expected from the prior information, there were no guards or other professionals around.

And the target was walking without a hint of caution.

<b>

(This is the perfect situation.)

<b>

Vigo positioned himself in the target's blind spot.

Then, he sent a hand signal to Gabriel and was about to leap out when…

<b>

"………Huh?"

<b>

The world flipped upside down in his view.

<b>

He tried to take a defensive posture immediately, but it was already too late.

<b>

"Ugh!?"

<b>

A violent impact coursed through Vigo's body.

It was more than enough to knock him unconscious.

<b>

"Damn it!"

<b>

Gabriel, startled by the sudden change that struck Vigo, instinctively drew his handgun and began searching for the assailant.

But there was no one around except for himself and the now unconscious Vigo.

<b>

(Could it be…!?)

<b>

—When all impossibilities have been eliminated, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth—

<b>

Recalling a famous line from the world's most renowned detective novel, Gabriel aimed his gun at the spot where the target had been.

However, the target was no longer there.

<b>

(What!? Where did he go!?)

<b>

Confused by the unexpected turn of events, Gabriel attempted to move from his position to search for the target.

It was then that he finally noticed the strange situation he was in.

<b>

"What the hell is this?"

<b>

Gabriel's lower body was deeply sunk in something resembling mud.

<b>

(That's impossible. This spot I’m standing on should definitely be asphalt!?)

<b>

Gabriel desperately tried to pull himself free, but his body barely moved, and instead, he sank further into the muck.

<b>

"Damn it, damn it, damn it!"

<b>

The more he struggled, the deeper he sank into the mire, draining his stamina.

Eventually, Gabriel's consciousness was also harvested, just like Vigo lying in front of him.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Garrett, any word from Vigo and Gabriel? We need to pull out soon."

"Nothing! No response at all!"

"Damn it, what's happening?"

<b>

Mirror checked his watch, sweating profusely.

They had been informed that the client and their associates could only disable the surrounding security cameras for a maximum of 45 minutes.

And 30 minutes had already passed since they began their operation.

If they stayed any longer, they would expose themselves to the police in this country.

<b>

(But we can't retreat without any results.)

<b>

This was their last chance. With that thought, Mirror peered through the scope of his sniper rifle.

<b>

"…………There!"

"Where!?"

"200 meters left from the crossroads! Right at the edge of the capture zone!"

<b>

Mirror shouted to Garrett and aimed at the target, a boy.

Just as he placed his finger on the trigger, a chill ran down his spine.

<b>

"What the hell is this?"

"Mirror! Did something happen!?"

"My, my rifle… it's frozen."

<b>

The sniper rifle that Mirror had cherished for years was encased in ice, even covering his fingers.

His body slowly began to turn into an ice sculpture, eventually rendering him completely immobile.

<b>

"Run, Garrett…! This isn't normal!"

<b>

Hearing that groan over the intercom, Garrett bolted from the spot.

<b>

"Damn it! What’s happening!?"

<b>

He thought it was odd that the reward for a simple kidnapping was so high.

He also felt uneasy about the permission to use firearms.

So he easily imagined that there was something behind it.

<b>

(But there's no way I could have predicted something like this!)

<b>

There was no way to foresee that a simple job of abducting an ordinary junior high school boy would turn into a real-life horror movie experience.

<b>

Garrett ran desperately toward the waiting van.

<b>

However, no matter how far he ran, the scenery before him remained unchanged from the spot he had been hiding.

<b>

"Ah, ahhhhhh!?"

<b>

Garrett realized, no, he was forced to realize.

That something massive behind him was pulling at his body.

<b>

"Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!"

<b>

Garrett drew his handgun from its holster and began firing at whatever was supposed to be behind him.

But the bullets fired from the handgun simply glided through the air, leaving only marks on the concrete wall.

<b>

Eventually, the bullets ran out, and Garrett crumpled to his knees.

<b>

"This is insane."

<b>

With those final words, Garrett lost consciousness, just like the others.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

After thoroughly binding the last one to lose consciousness, I let out a sigh.

Honestly, I wish they would consider my position of having to deal with these kinds of people every time.

For now, I healed them with magic, and I’ll leave the rest to whoever passes by.

<b>

As I was thinking that, my smartphone rang.

<b>

"Brother, are you done shopping yet?"

"I just finished now."

"You're in charge of house chores today, so hurry home."

"Yes, yes, as you wish."

<b>

After relaying that, I ended the call and decided to head home as instructed.

But first, I needed to check something.

<b>

"Status."
