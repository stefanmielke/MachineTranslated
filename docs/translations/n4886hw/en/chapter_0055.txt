# Episode 51: The Test of Courage Begins 7

"Ugh, this is brutal..."

<b>

Using the skill 'Sensory Sharing,' I dove into the memories of the samurai who was possessed by the cursed sword, and I couldn't help but feel nauseous at the scene that unfolded before me.

<b>

"Go! Attack and take them down!"

"We must find the princess at all costs!"

<b>

The castle, engulfed in massive pillars of fire, the enemy army advancing while splattered with blood, and the countless corpses lying on the ground.

It was far too intense for someone who had lived in peaceful modern Japan.

<b>

--- Despite being shown such horrors, I wonder if I can maintain my composure because the one I'm sharing senses with is used to such sights. Or perhaps... 

<b>

As I pondered this, my eyes caught sight of a man and woman desperately running through the mountains near the battlefield.

One was a young samurai in light armor, wielding a fine sword that resembled that cursed blade, and the other was a girl about my age, dressed in a beautiful kimono.

<b>

"Princess, we're almost to the cherry blossom tree! Please, hold on!"

"Haah... haah... I understand..."

<b>

Encouraging the breathless girl, the samurai cut down the enemies blocking their path.

<b>

"Kanbei, over here!"

<b>

While doing so, I heard a voice calling to the samurai.

Looking in the direction from which the voice came, I saw an older samurai clad in impressive armor and a helmet.

<b>

"Okajima-dono! Are you safe?!"

"Ah, I barely managed to escape in time. By the way, princess, are you hurt?"

"Kanbei protected me, so I'm fine. And my father...?"

<b>

The older samurai replied with a smile that seemed almost out of place given the circumstances, as the anxious girl asked.

<b>

"Please don't worry. The lord is hidden in a safe place where the enemy cannot reach him."

"I see... Kanbei, let's go to my father."

"Understood. Okajima-dono, I apologize for the suddenness, but may I guide you to the lord...?"

<b>

The young samurai named Kanbei felt a strange sensation in his abdomen and instinctively looked down, confused.

Because a sword belonging to the samurai named Okajima was stabbed into his belly.

<b>

"...What is this...?"

"I shall personally send you to the other world where the lord resides. So thank me and die quickly."

<b>

Saying this, Okajima plunged the sword into Kanbei once more to deliver the final blow.

<b>

"Kanbei!"

"Guh... P-Princess... run away quickly..."

"You're persistent. But with this wound, you won't survive. Now, princess, this way."

<b>

The princess instinctively rushed to Kanbei, who lay bleeding on the ground.

Meanwhile, Okajima looked down at Kanbei like a maggot, a sickening smile on his face as he extended his hand to the princess.

<b>

"Okajima, you...!"

"Rest assured, princess. The new lord who will govern this land will treat you well as his concubine."

"You betrayed my father and this country!?"

"I did not betray him. If I left that foolish man in charge, this country would perish. That is why I took action."

<b>

Having witnessed the samurai she had admired as a true brother or more being killed, the princess glared fiercely at Okajima, who still wore that unsettling smile.

Then, as if she had made up her mind, she exhaled and grasped the short sword at Kanbei's waist, drawing it from its sheath.

<b>

"Y-You!"

"If that's the case, I will go to my father as well. Thank you for your guidance."

<b>

With that, the princess plunged the short sword into her chest and collapsed over Kanbei.

<b>

"Okajima-sama, what is this...?"

"She has committed suicide. Damn it! How dare she trample on my kindness...!"

"Um, what should we do now...?"

"Cut off the princess's head and take it to the castle. That will silence the others who are still resisting."

"Understood."

<b>

After giving that order to the arriving retainers, Okajima spat on the princess's corpse.

And just as he was about to leisurely observe the moment her head was severed to calm his irritation.

<b>

"Guah!?"

<b>

One of the retainers surrounding the princess fell, blood gushing from his chest.

<b>

"Gah!?"

"N-Run... Guah!?"

<b>

One by one, Okajima's retainers fell, and soon the identity of the one who was cutting them down was revealed.

<b>

There, floating in the air, was a sword wrapped in black smoke and blood.

The sword glared at Okajima and the others with eyes that should not exist and began to move on its own.

<b>

"Y-It's the cursed sword...!"

<b>

Seeing this, one of the retainers muttered in fear.

Soon, they began to flee in panic from the cursed sword.

Among them was the samurai named Okajima.

<b>

"Y-You all, don't let that come near me!"

"Run away!!"

<b>

With a desperate expression, Okajima commanded his retainers as he ran down the mountain.

Naturally, the cursed sword, which was possessed by the samurai's spirit, pursued him, determined not to let him escape.

<b>

However, it seemed that the samurai's spirit had become something akin to a vengeful spirit, unable to detach itself from the cursed sword that had once been the princess.

<b>

"Princess... Princess..."

<b>

Eventually, the cursed sword pierced the ground, nestling beside the princess and its own corpse, weeping endlessly.

<b>

I, who was sharing senses with the samurai, realized.

He was still conscious, albeit barely, even after being stabbed by Okajima once more, having witnessed the moment his beloved princess took her own life.

<b>

The spirit of the samurai possessed by the cursed sword could only lament and curse.

Cursing those who had brought them to such a fate, their own destiny, their unfulfilled promise with the princess, and their own powerlessness.

<b>

That must be why he hadn't noticed.

The soul that had escaped from the princess gazed sorrowfully at the cursed sword, which continued to weep without finding peace.

<b>

<b>

"…Huh"

<b>

Now that I've confirmed all of this, it should be enough.

I activated my skill on the entire scene before me.

<b>

"Dispel."

<b>

In the next moment, all objects except for me and the cursed sword cracked and crumbled like glass.

At the same time, the spirit of the samurai, which had been like black smoke, peeled away from the cursed sword.

<b>

"Wha-What is this...!?"

"Finally, we can talk, dear samurai."

<b>

I bowed deeply to the spirit of the samurai, who had regained human form, and spoke cheerfully while activating the skill 'Recognition Obstruction.'

<b>

"You were the one from earlier... But what kind of technique did you use? No exorcist who sealed me could perform such a feat—"

<b>

The spirit of the samurai seemed to have regained some rationality, but confusion was evident on his face.

<b>

--- It's only natural to be bewildered after being suddenly freed from a sword that had bound him for hundreds of years.

As I considered this, I turned to face the spirit of the samurai.

<b>

What I discovered by peering into his memories through 'Sensory Sharing' was that the cursed sword itself was not inherently abnormal; it was the spirit of the samurai that had been emitting black smoke and forming armor.

Once I understood that, the rest was simple; I just needed to nullify the ability of the samurai's spirit to possess objects using 'Dispel.'

That way, the cursed sword would become nothing more than a rusty blade, and I could safely converse with the samurai's spirit.

<b>

"Well, that's a long story. How do you feel now?"

"I... I don't quite understand. But this is the first time I've felt so clear-headed since becoming a vengeful spirit. So what is your purpose for coming into my heart?"

"Of course, I came to resolve your troubles, dear samurai."

"Resolve my troubles, you say?"

"Yes. The reason you have yet to find peace is that there must be something you were unable to fulfill, correct?"

<b>

Upon hearing this, the spirit of the samurai fell silent.

<b>

(Well, we have all the time in the world, so take your time to think it over.)

<b>

Still, it's surprising that he would listen to the words of someone who barged into his heart uninvited.

'Recognition Obstruction' is truly formidable.

<b>

--- As I was thinking this.

<b>

"…I was unable to fulfill my promise to take the princess to that cherry blossom tree. That is my greatest regret."

"I see, so if we can resolve that, you can find peace?"

"However, it would be impossible to resolve that regret. The princess's soul is no longer in this world..."

"No, I believe it can be resolved."

<b>

The casual response I gave left the spirit of the samurai dumbfounded.

<b>

"What did you just say? You can clear this regret?"

"Yes. However, I will need your cooperation for that."

"I will do anything within my power! So please! Clear this regret for me!"

<b>

With that, the spirit of the samurai bowed deeply to me, pleading.

<b>

"Please, raise your head. I told you, I came to resolve your troubles."

"Oh, oh! Then I beg you! Please, please clear my regret!"

<b>

...Alright, I've secured my leverage.

Confirming that, I began to deactivate 'Sensory Sharing' and return my consciousness to the real world.

<b>

To completely resolve the issues of the samurai and the princess.
