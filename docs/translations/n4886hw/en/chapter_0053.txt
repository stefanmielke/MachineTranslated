# Episode 49: The Test of Courage Begins 5

<b>

<b>

What the hell? What just happened?

<b>

In an instant, my mind, that of Iihara Takehiko, was overwhelmed with confusion, chaos, and fear by the bizarre scene unfolding before me.

<b>

The strength of the barrier techniques passed down in the Iihara family is said to be as solid as a fortress.

However, that thing that appeared from the place where the animal-like creature was――a monstrous hybrid of a stag beetle and a disk, pierced through the wall of the defensive barrier I had deployed with a single shot from its mouth.

<b>

“W-what! Are you really okay!?”

“Shut up! Be quiet!”

<b>

Okojima, looking terrified, grabbed my arm and shouted.

I shook him off roughly and tried to refocus on repairing the barrier.

<b>

But.

<b>

“Kiinnn……”

<b>

The monstrous entity clung to the barrier and began to widen the hole while rotating its body.

<b>

“Damn it!”

<b>

I poured more spiritual power into the barrier in an attempt to split the monster in half.

<b>

“Gii… Gii…”

<b>

Gradually, the rotation of the monster's body weakened.

<b>

I was just a breath away from finishing it off.

Confident of victory, I concentrated my awareness on the monster――at that moment.

<b>

“What the…?”

<b>

That beam pierced through the barrier again along with the disk monster.

And I finally realized there was not just one of those monsters.

<b>

“Eek!?”

<b>

Ten, twenty, no, there are more. There must be at least a hundred of them.

<b>

Such a number of monsters had their mouths aimed at the barrier.

<b>

“―――”

<b>

In the next moment, the monsters unleashed that beam toward the barrier all at once.

The defensive barrier, perfected by my utmost effort in barrier techniques, was pierced and shredded to pieces.

<b>

Eventually, the barrier shattered with a sound like glass breaking.

<b>

<b>

“Ah… ah, ah…!”

<b>

I have to escape quickly. That is an existence I can never defeat on my own.

<b>

Though my mind screamed that, my body was completely paralyzed with fear and confusion, unable to move even a little.

<b>

“―――”

<b>

As I stood there defenseless, the disk monsters that broke through the barrier surrounded me with eerie sounds, their mouths aimed directly at me.

<b>

“……Ah, ah?”

<b>

In this dire situation, I recalled death and instinctively closed my eyes, but I felt no pain at all.

When I cautiously opened my eyes, I found that my body was not missing any parts.

It seemed I had avoided being pierced by that beam.

However, that did not mean my safety was assured.

Because.

<b>

“……What the hell is this?”

<b>

What was covering us from the neck down, something sticky like slime, was completely robbing us of our bodily freedom.

In this state, if we were attacked by the enemy, it was clear we would be killed without any resistance.

Even if we were not attacked, if left like this, we would soon starve to death.

<b>

This is truly hopeless. I am completely cornered.

<b>

As I was thinking such pathetic thoughts, I heard rustling sounds coming from the bushes ahead.

Would I finally face the one who had driven us to this point?

I waited for that moment, feeling a mix of fear and curiosity about what kind of person could achieve such a feat.

<b>

――And.

<b>

(Is that the sorcerer?)

<b>

What appeared were a pair of high school students, a boy and a girl.

The girl possessed a powerful spiritual energy compared to an average exorcist.

At first, I thought that girl was the sorcerer who created the monsters and destroyed the barrier.

However, that thought was immediately denied the moment I glanced at the boy next to her.

<b>

“……!?”

<b>

The boy had no face. To be more precise, I could not perceive his face.

He was not hiding his face with a mask or anything. So, if I wanted to look, I should have been able to see it clearly.

<b>

But my instincts warned me.

I must not look at that face. If I do, I would see the most terrifying thing in this world.

<b>

As I was terrified of that boy, the other girl had somehow appeared in front of me.

Her face was somewhat familiar, and she looked down at me as if she had something to say.

<b>

“……Surrender and follow our instructions. If you do, we promise not to inflict any further harm.”

<b>

At that moment, I finally remembered that the girl before me was Kuon’s daughter.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

(……Well then)

<b>

While Kuon faced the one who created this barrier, I was inspecting a thought-control drone generated by my “Water Magic.”

<b>

This drone was something I came up with after watching a certain sci-fi anime.

From its barrel, it could fire destructive lasers, as well as emit slime to restrain them and mist with sleep-inducing properties, and the blades resembling stag beetle pincers attached to its sides had cutting power like a water cutter.

<b>

<b>

(Alright, it seems there are no malfunctions for now)

<b>

After finishing the check with the skill “Appraisal,” I shifted my gaze to Kuon, who was facing Iihara.

<b>

(Who would have thought they would want to meet me directly without hiding their faces…?)

<b>

According to Kuon, “Even if they were exiled, if they were in the world of supernatural abilities, they should know me. They could use that to bluff that the Kuon family is involved.”

<b>

(……Well, they are under the influence of “Cognitive Disruption Magic,” so they should feel fear towards me, and I have plenty of drones prepared, so it should be fine. Besides, if it comes to it―――)

<b>

“Then after we lift the barrier, you will be taken to the appropriate authorities. Is that understood?”

“………Yeah, I got it.”

<b>

It seems the discussion has concluded.

From here on, it’s my turn.

<b>

I confirmed that Kuon nodded, then approached Iihara to activate “Dispel” to lift the barrier.

<b>

At that moment.

<b>

“W-wait aaaaah!!!”

“!?”

<b>

The man named Kai, who was restrained by slime, shouted with bloodshot eyes and swallowed something he had apparently been holding in his mouth.

<b>

“Ugh, it hurts! It hurts!”

<b>

At the same time, Okojima, who was also restrained by slime and should not have been able to move a finger, reached into his pocket where he had been carefully holding a rusty sword.

<b>

I instinctively tried to activate “Dispel,” but it was already too late――.

<b>

“Shit…”

<b>

In my carelessness, the last talisman affixed to the sword was peeled off.
