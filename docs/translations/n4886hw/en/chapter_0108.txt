# Chapter 103: The Preparation for the Cultural Festival Has Begun 6

"Good morning, Kyori."

"G-Good morning, Shu-kun."

<b>

The next morning, Kyori and I met at the same place as yesterday, feeling a slight embarrassment at calling each other by our first names as we walked together to the station.

Still...

<b>

"Ah, it's already a week before the test... I don't like it..."

"Is there a subject you're worried about?"

"To be honest, I'm worried about all of them. I just want to avoid getting a failing grade."

"...Huh? Shu-kun, your grades were at the top, right? They were even posted on the school bulletin board."

"Just because I got high scores on the first semester tests doesn't mean I'll get high scores on the second semester tests."

"That's true, I guess."

<b>

While saying that, I know that this is just my anxiety, but no matter how much I cram formulas and classical literature grammar into my head, or desperately copy English words and kanji, I can't shake off the anxiety of "Is this really okay? Am I missing something? Did I memorize the formulas incorrectly?"

If I could use skills like 'Universal Translation' or 'Appraisal,' I wouldn't have to study for the tests and wouldn't have to deal with this anxiety.

<b>

(After saying that, relying on skills would be so lame...)

<b>

I've been trying not to use skills for tests and exams, but since I declared to Kyori that I would become someone who can stand next to her even without abilities, I have no choice but to study hard.

But with the situation regarding Ikoma-senpai and the cultural festival... No, but relying on skills would be uncool...

Ah, no, no. I was about to get lost in my own world, leaving Kyori behind.

<b>

"What about you, Kyori? Are you confident about this test?"

"...I don't know. I've been absent from school for a long time because of my family situation."

"But you were able to answer normally when the teacher called on you, right?"

"That was just because I happened to be studying at that time. I might end up lowering my grades this time."

<b>

Kyori said that with a wry smile.

But well, Kyori got perfect scores in all subjects on the first semester tests, so even if she does lower her grades, she'll probably maintain her top position.

<b>

Well, regardless of anything.

<b>

"We still have to study hard for the tests, right?"

"Yes."

<b>

As we reached that somewhat obvious conclusion and shared a wry smile, a thought suddenly crossed my mind.

Neither of us is confident about this test. The midterm tests will be held over the weekend. Since we're in the test period, there are no club activities. And I have something I want to secretly tell Kyori.

...And this is completely a personal desire, but since we started dating, I'd like to do something couple-like with Kyori if possible.

From those various thoughts, one idea came to mind.

<b>

"...Hey, this is more of a suggestion or consultation, but since we both seem to lack confidence for the midterm tests, how about we have a study session this weekend? ...If possible, just the two of us."

"Let's definitely do it!"

<b>

As I said that nervously, Kyori grabbed my hand and replied with a beaming smile.

Seeing her unexpected reaction, I froze for a moment, and Kyori, embarrassed, quickly let go of my hand.

<b>

"...Ah, I'm sorry. I got carried away..."

"N-No, I don't mind. So, it's okay to say we're doing the study session, right?"

<b>

In response to my question, Kyori nodded modestly.

It seems she was still embarrassed about what just happened.

As proof, Kyori's ears were slightly red.

<b>

"Got it. So which day this weekend should we have the study session? I don't have any plans for either day."

"I-I don't mind either day... But if possible, I want to be together both days."

<b>

(C-So cute...)

<b>

I almost impulsively hugged Kyori, but I desperately held back with the remaining rationality, knowing I couldn't do that in public.

But still, it's surprising how people's perspectives change when relationships change.

<b>

"Okay, then let's have study sessions together both days."

"Yes!"

<b>

Kyori looked genuinely happy.

...Now, the remaining issue is the location.

<b>

"Ah, by the way, where should we have the study session? The library might be good since there won't be many people from our school, and we won't have to worry about being seen."

"...Um, can we have the study session at Shu-kun's house?"

"My house?"

"Yes. I would like to visit Shu-kun's house at least once..."

<b>

Hmm, a study session at my house.

There's nothing particularly embarrassing to show, and my dad probably won't be home, and I can just tell Kana, "A friend is coming over, so stay out this weekend."

<b>

"Got it. Then let's have the study session at my house this weekend. I'll send you a message later with the nearest station, and we can meet there."

"Yes!"

<b>

As we were discussing that, we finally arrived at the station.

It's really bittersweet, but we have to part ways for now.

<b>

"See you at school."

"Yeah, take care on your way."

<b>

After parting with Kyori, I moved to the spot where Ikoma-senpai had been harassed by delinquents and activated 'Appraisal.'

However, the appraisal results displayed were all just straightforward descriptions of the subjects, and there was nothing particularly strange.

<b>

(But just to be safe, I should leave a drone that can activate 'Cognitive Disruption Magic.')

<b>

I activated the skill and deployed the modified 'Water Eye' that lasts longer in various locations around the station, then tried to teleport near the school with 'Spatial Transfer Magic'â€” 

<b>

"?!"

<b>

Suddenly, someone tugged at the hem of my uniform.

W-Who is it? I don't feel any intent to attack or anything like that...

<b>

"Um, could you listen to my selfish request?"

<b>

As I was pondering this, I heard a familiar voice, or rather, the voice of the girl I had just parted with.

When I turned around, there was Kyori, just as I expected.

But why is she here?

<b>

"Kyori? Didn't you go to the station...?"

"Yes. But, um, I wanted to do something... It's really personal, though."

"Something you want to do?"

"Um, I want to walk to school with Shu-kun..."

"But if we do that, we'll be seen by the people at school, right?"

"I don't mind! For me, it's more important to be with Shu-kun for even one more second!"

<b>

Kyori, who is so popular that she's called an angel, wants to walk to school with me, who is just a background character.

If the people at school see that, they'll definitely throw various looks at us.

But Kyori gathered her courage and told me she wants to be with me.

And to be honest, I want to be with Kyori for as long as possible too.

<b>

"...Okay, then let's go together."

"O-Okay...!"

<b>

I stepped out from the alley with Kyori and started walking toward the station.

<b>

If we go to school like this, I'm sure Ren-taro and the others will look at us in various ways.

...But.

<b>

"...Since it's a special occasion, should we hold hands?"

"Yes!"

<b>

When I suggested that to the fidgeting Kyori, she beamed and took my hand.

<b>

--Seeing Kyori's smile like this, I thought that I wouldn't mind whatever the people at school say.

I thought that while looking at the smile of my precious girlfriend.
