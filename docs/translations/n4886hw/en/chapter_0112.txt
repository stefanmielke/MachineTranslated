# Episode 107: The Preparation for the Cultural Festival Has Begun 10

"…Is it really okay to take her to the clubroom like this?"

"Yeah, once Kyori introduces her as 'someone who is interested in the Literary Club and wants to help out,' she should be accepted."

<b>

After school on the last day of the midterm exams.

After finishing the homeroom in the early afternoon, Kyori and I were confirming the arrangements in a secluded courtyard near the clubroom building.

<b>

"In that case, I'll try to enter the clubroom as naturally as possible."

"That would be helpful. Also, I've set it up so that I can detect any abnormal behavior immediately, so if you feel any discomfort, please contact me right away."

"Understood. …Well then, I'm counting on you."

<b>

Upon hearing Kyori's words, I activated the 'Item Box,' and a doll that looked like a human wearing this school's uniform appeared.

When I infused it with MP to activate it, she bowed to us with her usual gentle demeanor.

<b>

"Good morning. Master, and Kyori-sama. What can I do for you today?"

"I want you to go to the Literary Club's room with Kyori and act like a student of this school while getting close to the club president there. For now, just focus on that."

"Understood. Then, shall we go, Kyori-sama?"

"Y-yes. …Well then, I'm off."

<b>

<b>

Watching Kyori being led by the doll to the clubroom building, I let out a deep sigh.

<b>

…Yeah, I can't shake off the feeling of discomfort seeing the doll being so obedient to us, and talking to her makes me unnecessarily tense.

Should I have changed her appearance at least? But if I mess with it too much, it might end up looking weird…

<b>

"Indeed, unless you were informed beforehand that it's a doll, you would only think it's a human."

<b>

As I was thinking about this, I heard a voice from behind.

Startled, I turned around to see Alicia, nodding in understanding with her arms crossed.

<b>

"I-I'm surprised... Don't just appear out of nowhere."

"Sorry for startling you. But you can't be too friendly with me in front of your important girlfriend, can you?"

"Well, that's true, but…"

<b>

I haven't revealed my relationship with Alicia or her true identity to Kyori.

The reason is quite simple: Alicia told me not to say anything.

Well, her true identity is that of someone who does work that can't be made public, and I might need to rely on that side of her in the future.

So, the public-facing relationship between Alicia and me is that we just happened to be in the same group during the camping trip, and we aren't particularly close or distant, which is quite ambiguous.

<b>

"By the way, thank you for preparing the enrollment documents for the doll. That was helpful."

"It's not something to be thanked for. We want to avoid a situation where a bunch of ordinary people gather and a power explosion causes a huge panic."

<b>

I've applied 'Recognition Suppression Magic' to the newly created doll to make her believe she is a student of this school at all times, but there is still a possibility that someone might find her suspicious and check her identity or enrollment.

That's why I contacted Alicia to prepare a fake identity.

<b>

"By the way, I heard that the doll was repurposed from the one that caused a commotion at the Kuon family. Did you investigate its origins?"

"Of course. What I found out is that it was created using an ability I know nothing about, and I couldn't determine who made it or where it came from. I tried to extract memories or records, but that was also impossible."

"The identity and principles remain unknown. What about the possibility of that doll going berserk?"

"I added a shikigami technique to the core part and made it subordinate, so I don't think there's a chance of it going berserk. As a precaution, I've set it up so that if it makes any strange movements, it will be unable to move from the inside, so it should be fine."

"…Well, for now, we can only trust that. Still, Kyori-san, you really accepted using that doll with that appearance."

"Well, when I first showed it to her, she made a really unpleasant face, but since there was no more effective strategy than using that for the time being, I managed to get her to accept it as a temporary measure."

<b>

The day after modifying the doll, during a study session for the test, I showed the new doll during a break, and as expected, Kyori looked confused and asked, "Are we really going to use this as it is?"

I managed to persuade her, and she understood, but every time she sees that form, she has an expression that makes it seem like she wants to look away immediately.

I should probably prepare some kind of improvement plan. Regardless of the material, the doll will be used for a long time going forward.

<b>

Oh, right. There was something I wanted to ask as well.

<b>

"By the way, did Ikoma-senpai's ability activate during the test period?"

"I've confirmed two instances of what seems to be power explosions. The first was when a stage actor, who had been following her on social media and was a passionate fan, suddenly moved into the apartment next to hers. The second was the next day when she was being harassed by delinquents and was helped by that stage actor, and then out of nowhere, she was invited to friend him on a messaging app."

"And how did Ikoma-senpai respond to that?"

"She repeatedly bowed her head and apologized, refusing the friend request and escaping from the scene. She probably realized it was a power explosion."

<b>

Her favorite actor suddenly moves in next door, and the next day, she is helped by him just like I was when I was harassed by delinquents.

It sounds like a plot that could happen in a comic posted online, but it's a situation that is almost impossible in reality.

And she apologized profusely for being invited to friend him.

<b>

Her imagined scenarios are happening as reality.

If she could think of it as just a coincidence, she might have felt lucky, but Ikoma-senpai knows that it's a power explosion of her ability, and she feels sorry about it.

Additionally, Ikoma-senpai has a fear of men due to bullying she suffered in elementary school.

Considering that, she is probably under a lot of stress right now.

Well, there's no point in thinking about it here and now.

For now, I'll just hope that the doll makes a good impression on Ikoma-senpai.

<b>

"Well then, I should be going soon. If you notice any abnormalities, please contact me."

"Got it. See you at school next week."

"Yes."

<b>

Alicia waved lightly and headed toward the school building with the shoe lockers.

Now then…

<b>

(No abnormal reactions have been detected from either the doll or the drones set up in the clubroom. I guess things are going well so far.)

<b>

But there could always be a chance of something happening. Fortunately, I'm not on housework duty today, so I'll just tell Kana that I'm "going to be late" and keep an eye on things here for a while.

<b>

"!"

<b>

Just as I was thinking that, my phone vibrated.

I hurriedly opened it to see a message from Kyori.

And the content of that message was completely unexpected.

<b>

"I'm sorry. Ikoma-senpai wants to know your messaging app account. What should I do?"

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

—A few minutes ago.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, I'm [Ibara Yuna]."

"H-Hello…! I'm Juri Ikoma, the president of the Literary Club."

<b>

When I, Kuon Kyori, introduced the doll—Yuna—as planned with Shu-kun, Ikoma-senpai returned the greeting with a very nervous demeanor.

I was told that Shu-kun made it safe to use, so it should be fine, and I understand that it's necessary in this situation, but I can't help but feel wary standing shoulder to shoulder with someone I had a deadly encounter with just two weeks ago.

<b>

"…Senpai, this is the girl I mentioned before who wants to join the Literary Club."

"Y-Yes. I've heard the story…! But, um, since it's the preparation period for the cultural festival, I can't accept the enrollment form…"

"I'm aware of that. However, it shouldn't be a problem for her to help with the preparations for the cultural festival, right?"

"Y-You're right. B-but, is it really okay...? It's just a club that endlessly continues boring tasks, and Yuna-san is so beautiful, so, um, it might be better to apply to a more glamorous club…"

"No, I want to join this club! I will help out in any way I can for that!"

"I-I see… Then, um, could you please give me a copy of this document…?"

<b>

Ikoma-senpai seemed to be overwhelmed by Yuna's enthusiasm… or rather, she appeared to have given up and asked for her help.

<b>

『With the current senpai, if Yuna earnestly asks to help with the Literary Club for the cultural festival, she might misunderstand it as a power explosion of her ability.』

<b>

When we were deciding the arrangements, Shu-kun had mentioned that, and it seems that it has indeed turned out that way.

I feel a lot of guilt for deceiving Ikoma-senpai, but at least we've cleared the first hurdle.

Now, we just have to wait for senpai and the doll to get along, or so I thought just then…

<b>

"Um, Kyori-chan. I have something I want to ask, is that okay?"

<b>

Ikoma-senpai approached me, her face flushed.

<b>

"Sure. What do you want to ask?"

"Um, do you know the messaging app account of that Iori-san who came to the clubroom the other day? If you do, could you tell me…?"

<b>

I was taken aback by Ikoma-senpai's unexpected request and froze on the spot.

She had previously mentioned that she was bullied by boys in her grade during elementary school and had been afraid of men ever since.

So why does she want Shu-kun's contact information…?

<b>

"I know it. But senpai, he's a boy, are you sure you're okay with that?"

"Y-Yeah, I think it's okay. Iori-san spoke kindly to me, and he seemed knowledgeable about my problems, so I thought it would be nice to talk to him again…"

<b>

The "problem" that Ikoma-senpai is referring to is most likely her ability to make her delusions become reality.

According to what I heard from Shu-kun, he had checked various things regarding Ikoma-senpai's ability, so she might have thought that he was knowledgeable about the issues she is facing.

<b>

…Even so, it's concerning that senpai, who was so afraid of interacting with men, is treating Shu-kun differently.

<b>

"Understood. I'll check with him first if it's okay to share it."

"Y-Yeah. Thank you…!"

<b>

With that, I opened my phone and sent him a message.

<b>

…Feeling a vague sense of unease in the corner of my mind.
