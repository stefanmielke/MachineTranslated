# Episode 35: A Sister's Recollection 2

“...sigh”

<b>

When I got home, I didn't even have the energy to turn on the lights and just collapsed on the sofa.

It was truly fortunate that the dojo was closed.

If I had gone to the dojo in this state, I wouldn't have been able to focus on practice anyway.

<b>

What should I have done?

If I hadn't asked to see more back then, would such a thing not have happened?

Would it have been better if I had noticed earlier that she was being bullied?

Or perhaps――.

<b>

“...”

<b>

My mind was filled with regret and guilt.

I no longer had the energy to get back up.

<b>

“I'm home!”

<b>

As I was thinking about such things, my brother came home in his usual carefree manner.

<b>

“...welcome back”

<b>

I squinted at the sudden brightness of the room's lights and replied in a tired voice.

<b>

“What’s wrong? Did you catch a cold?”

“...It's nothing. Just a bit tired from school. I'll make dinner after I rest a bit.”

“Just stay resting. I'll take care of the chores today.”

“...then please do.”

<b>

If he was willing to take over, I might as well let him. Cooking in this state would definitely end in failure.

<b>

After my brother stood in the kitchen for a while, a delicious smell began to waft through the air.

From the smell, it was probably minestrone.

But my stomach was not in a state to accept anything.

<b>

“It seems like it will be ready soon, but can you eat?”

“...not yet. Just put it in the fridge.”

“Got it. Also, I’ll be going out for a bit, so please keep an eye on the house.”

“...okay.”

<b>

My brother returned to the kitchen, put the finished dish in the fridge, and then came back to me.

<b>

“Is there anything you want me to buy?”

“It's fine, don't worry about it.”

<b>

I could no longer stay awake any longer.

Having reached the limit of my physical and mental fatigue, I slowly closed my eyes and began to think about tomorrow.

For now, I should report those scumbags to the teacher.

And though I didn't know what I could do, I would try to help Seina with her manga.

After that――.

<b>

At that moment, I felt something soft being draped over me.

Could it be that my brother covered me with a blanket?

I tried to confirm it, but the overwhelming drowsiness made it impossible for me to open my eyelids.

<b>

<b>

“...‘Healing Magic’”

<b>

Just as I was about to fall asleep, I heard a voice, and at the same time, I felt my body's fatigue ease, but I couldn't tell if that was something that happened in reality or just a dream.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

Since that incident, Seina stopped coming to school.

Even when I sent messages, they remained unread, and since I didn't know where she lived, I couldn't meet her directly.

As I continued in this state, I was further distressed by the disciplinary action taken against those three who had bullied Seina.

They were called to the student guidance office, and that was the only punishment they received.

The only other thing was a handout distributed in homeroom that said, “Bullying is not acceptable.”

The price for ruining the work that Seina had poured her heart and soul into for her dream was just that.

I didn't know if their guardians pleaded with the school or if the school was trying to cover it up.

Either way, I couldn't accept it, so I decided to protest to the homeroom teacher.

In response, the teacher――.

<b>

“Just focus on your studies and don’t worry about unnecessary things.”

<b>

With a cold attitude, he forcibly ended the conversation.

<b>

I could say that this incident had almost completely extinguished my desire to attend school.

Still, I somehow mustered the will to go to school.

If I went every day, I might be able to see Seina again. I believed that the mundane days of chatting in that empty classroom and seeing her wonderful masterpieces could return.

<b>

<b>

Several days passed, and one day, I received a notification on my messaging app.

The sender was Seina, and the content was just one line: “Please come to that empty classroom after school tomorrow.”

<b>

Receiving a message from Seina should have been a very joyful thing.

Yet, I felt a sense of unease about her message.

The writing style was completely different from Seina's usual tone, and the instructions were extremely brief.

I had no certainty that this was really a message from Seina.

<b>

But I had no choice but to go.

I couldn't let the chance to see Seina again slip away.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“...Seina, I’m here.”

<b>

The curtains in the empty classroom were drawn, and nothing could be seen from the hallway.

<b>

“Come in.”

<b>

The voice that came from inside was somewhat muffled, but it was undoubtedly Seina's voice.

Her tone seemed to indicate that she was in a good mood.

Feeling a slight sense of relief, I opened the door――.

<b>

<b>

“...what are you doing?”

<b>

I felt a sudden fear at what was happening in the empty classroom.

<b>

The classroom itself hadn’t changed at all since the last time I was there. The difference this time was the people gathered.

<b>

In the center of the classroom, there were three female students, those who had bullied Seina, looking like they were about to cry as they sat on the floor.

<b>

And on the other side was―――.

<b>

“It's been a while, Kana-chan.”

<b>

A white giant, like a marionette, suspended in the air by shimmering purple threads, with a creepy eyeball drawn large on its head.

Accompanied by such a monster, Seina smiled darkly.
