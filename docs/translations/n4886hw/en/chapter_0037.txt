# Episode 34 A Sister's Recollection 1

――side Kana

<b>

The first time I met that girl was right after I advanced to the second year of middle school.

That day, the dojo was closed due to an urgent matter with the instructor, and with nothing to do, I decided to take a stroll around the school.

Two years ago, the explosion incident that involved my brother led to a major reconstruction of this school, and many new facilities were introduced.

However, I usually went to the dojo, went shopping at the supermarket, or occasionally hung out with friends after school, so I had never seen those facilities.

At 14 years old, I thought it was childish of me to explore the school, but since I had no plans with friends and nothing else to do, I kept telling myself that as I wandered around――.

<b>

“Ah…”

<b>

In an unused classroom at the edge of the school building, I saw a girl sitting at a desk, completely absorbed in drawing something.

Her bangs were so long that it was hard to see her face, but even from my perspective as a girl, I thought her features were quite well-defined.

<b>

“…”

<b>

Since she was so focused, I knew I shouldn't disturb her by talking. Yet, for some reason, I couldn't take my eyes off her.

<b>

“Hey, you…”

“Eek! I-I’m sorry! I’ll clean up right away!”

<b>

When I spoke to her, she jumped and stood up, pulling her pen away from the paper.

<b>

“I-I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to startle you.”

“Um… who are you…?”

“I’m Kana Iori from class 2-A. You seemed really focused on what you were drawing, so I was curious about it. If it’s a bother, I can leave right away.”

“...I’m glad. You’re not one of those people…”

“Eh?”

“N-No! It’s not a bother at all! You can stay here as long as you like!”

“Then I’ll just take a quick look.”

<b>

When I said that, she turned back to her desk and started drawing again.

Her eyes, focused on the paper, sparkled so much that I was involuntarily drawn to them――.

<b>

“Um, um!”

<b>

As I was lost in admiration, she suddenly spoke up.

<b>

“D-Do you want to see?”

“See? Are you going to show me what you’re drawing?”

“Well, um, I originally drew it for someone to read, so…”

<b>

Saying that, she shyly handed me several sheets of paper.

What was drawn there was――.

<b>

“A manga?”

“Y-Yes! I was thinking of submitting it for a newcomer award…”

“So you’re aiming to be a manga artist?”

“Well, um, sort of…”

<b>

I don’t read much manga.

When I do, it’s usually just to glance at what my brother has in his room to pass the time, and I’ve never felt anything special while reading them.

<b>

So I thought I wouldn’t feel anything even if I read what she handed me.

But then I thought.

<b>

“――It’s interesting.”

“R-Really…!?”

“Yeah! The manga you drew is more interesting than any manga I’ve ever read!”

<b>

Those words came from the bottom of my heart.

The manga she drew moved me more than any story I had encountered before, and I finished reading it in no time, completely absorbed.

<b>

“Hey, is there a continuation of this!?”

“Um, well… I’m still in the process of drawing the continuation…”

“I see… Then when it’s done—sorry for saying this suddenly. Was that a bother?”

“N-No! I don’t think it’s a bother at all! I’ll show you as soon as I finish the continuation!”

<b>

Saying that, she looked straight into my eyes.

I was so happy to hear that, and I took her hand and replied.

<b>

“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it. By the way, what’s your name?”

“Ah, um, I’m Seina Amagi from class 2-C…”

“Seina-chan, huh? Like I said, I’m Kana Iori from class 2-A. Let me know as soon as you finish the continuation.”

“Yes!”

<b>

This was the first meeting between me and her, Seina Amagi.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Kana, let’s have lunch together!”

“Sorry! I have plans today!”

<b>

After declining my friend's invitation, I headed towards that empty classroom.

During lunch break, I would get to see the new manga Seina drew; this was my current daily life at school.

Since Fujisawa-senpai moved away when she entered high school, my daily life had become somewhat dull.

But Seina and the manga she drew changed that for me.

<b>

I don’t know what criteria the newcomer award uses to select the grand prize, but to me, the manga Seina drew looked like it could be serialized in a magazine.

However, it seemed Seina was not satisfied with her work and kept rewriting and redoing it over and over――.

Then the other day, I received a message saying she finally drew a piece she was confident about and wanted me to see it.

<b>

I ran with a bento box and some snacks to cheer her up.

I was filled with anticipation about what kind of work Seina’s confident piece would be.

<b>

“P-Please stop!”

<b>

Suddenly, I heard Seina’s scream.

When I hurried to the empty classroom, I found three girls I had never seen before surrounding Seina, who was desperately trying to get something back from them, tears in her eyes.

In their hands were the original manuscripts of the manga Seina had drawn――.

<b>

“What did you do to Seina!?”

<b>

When I yelled angrily, the tall girl who seemed to be the leader turned around with an annoyed expression.

<b>

“Huh? Who are you to her?”

“I’m her friend! More importantly, what did you do to Seina!?”

“A friend? Well, good for you, ugly. You have friends who accept such disgusting things she draws.”

“P-Please…! Give that back…!”

<b>

Seina pleaded desperately for her manuscript, but the tall girl just smiled mockingly at her.

<b>

“If it’s that important, I’ll give it back. Like this!”

<b>

The tall girl pulled out a cutter knife from her pocket and began to slash the manuscript.

<b>

“――!”

<b>

Seeing that, I lost my composure and grabbed the girl by her collar.

<b>

“Gah…!”

“Do you have any idea how much effort Seina put into drawing this!? Apologize to Seina right now! Otherwise――”

<b>

She was tall but lacked muscle. I thought I could easily take her down.

Just as I was about to put more force into it――.

<b>

“...It’s okay now, Kana-chan.”

<b>

Saying that, Seina gently pulled my hand away from her.

<b>

“Cough cough, you’ll regret this!”

<b>

Taking advantage of that moment, the tall girl distanced herself from me and, supported by the other two girls, left the empty classroom.

<b>

Only Seina and I were left behind.

<b>

“...Can it be fixed?”

“I don’t think so. If the pages are cut like this, it’s already…”

“What about a copy!? Or――”

“I only had this one. This was all I had left…”

<b>

Big tears overflowed from Seina’s eyes.

It was my fault. It was because I said, “I want to see it when it’s done”…….

<b>

“I’m sorry. It’s because I said that…”

“...Kana-san, you did nothing wrong. It’s because I got carried away and was too happy that God punished me.”

“That’s not――”

<b>

Seina gathered the torn manuscript and deeply bowed her head to me before leaving the empty classroom.

<b>

I couldn’t even call out to Seina and could only stand there, dumbfounded.
