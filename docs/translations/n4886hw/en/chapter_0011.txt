# Episode 10: I Ended Up Helping People 3

“Fujisawa, run!”

<b>

As I shouted that loudly, I pinned the man in front of me—Kajiwara—to the ground to prevent him from reaching Fujisawa.

Fujisawa hesitated for a moment, but after seeing my face and nodding, she took her smartphone and ran outside with her younger brothers.

<b>

“You bastard! Are you trying to take Haruna from me?!”

<b>

Seeing that, Kajiwara shouted angrily with bloodshot eyes and pulled out a cutter knife from his pocket to slash at me.

<b>

No, but seriously, this is really scary. A fully grown adult reeking of strong alcohol is genuinely trying to kill me.

I mean, from the looks of it, he doesn’t seem to realize I’m a student from his own class.

Was Fujisawa that ideal a woman for him?

<b>

But well, it would be pretty uncool to get scared and run away after getting this involved.

<b>

“Die!!!”

“Whoa!”

<b>

Kajiwara aimed for my face, or rather, my eyeball, thrusting the cutter knife at me.

<b>

(‘Wind Magic’)

<b>

As the name suggests, ‘Wind Magic’ is a skill that creates wind using MP.

I activated it to shift the trajectory of his arm and dodged the attack.

Then, taking advantage of the slight opening that appeared, I shoved Kajiwara away, picked up the fallen cutter knife, and teleported it away using ‘Spatial Transfer Magic.’

<b>

“Where the hell did you send that?!”

“Who knows? Where could it be, huh?”

<b>

I dashed forward and pinned Kajiwara against the wall again.

Now, I just needed to keep this bastard immobilized and buy as much time as possible.

Just as I thought to put more strength into my arms.

<b>

“...Huh?”

<b>

Kajiwara wore a suspicious smile.

Right after that, I heard heavy footsteps approaching from the hallway.

<b>

“Tch, you’re slow! Yas!”

“Sorry, bro. I let the kid get away!”

<b>

A man in a black tracksuit with dyed golden hair entered the room, gripping a metal bat in his right hand.

<b>

(…‘Appraisal’)

<b>

―――

<b>

Yasunori Hamada, 26 years old, Human

Status: Drug Addiction

Notes: Joined a biker gang in rebellion against his parents and got into drugs after being recommended by his friends from that time.

Convicted of violating the Stimulants Control Law, sentenced to 1 year and 6 months in prison with a 3-year suspended sentence.

<b>

―――

<b>

The man Kajiwara referred to as Yas was not someone related to him or someone a public middle school teacher should associate with.

…Well, I had thought he might be hanging out with such people since the time I used ‘Tracking and Detection Magic’ to ‘Appraise’ him.

<b>

<b>

“Tch, it can’t be helped. For now, let’s take care of this brat.”

“Y-yes, understood!”

<b>

Saying that, Yas raised the metal bat high.

<b>

I had rushed here using ‘Spatial Transfer Magic’ after receiving a call from my sister, so I only had a little over 10% of my MP left.

Even if I sent the metal bat away using ‘Spatial Transfer Magic’ now, it wouldn’t help at all.

<b>

So this is it, huh.

<b>

“Die, you bastard!!!”

<b>

Then the man called Yas swung the metal bat down towards my head――.

<b>

In the next moment, a sound that felt out of place echoed through the room.

<b>

“………Huh?”

<b>

The man called Yas opened his eyes wide in surprise.

In fact, I was also at a loss for what had just happened.

<b>

Because all I did was try to protect my head with my arm.

<b>

“Hey, what the hell are you doing? Hurry up and take care of him!”

“I know what I’m doing!”

<b>

When Kajiwara ordered in a trembling voice, the man called Yas swung the metal bat down with force again.

Then, a sound like something breaking was heard, and both of them showed expressions of relief.

They probably misunderstood that my arm had broken.

So they couldn’t immediately notice the anomaly that occurred with the metal bat in Yas's hand.

<b>

The silver bat had bent at a right angle where the hitting part had made contact with my arm.

After a few seconds, when they finally realized this, all traces of composure vanished from their faces.

<b>

“Wha...”

“No way, that can’t be…”

<b>

Ignoring their fear of the unexpected situation, I checked my ‘Status.’

―――

<b>

The decreased HP was only 10.

That was the maximum damage Yas could inflict on me with all his strength at once.

<b>

“.........”

<b>

It seems I had unconsciously put a limit on my own power.

But now that I realized that, things would go quickly.

<b>

I approached Yas, who was staring blankly at what was once a metal bat, and lightly flicked his forehead with my finger.

<b>

“Wha?!”

<b>

Then Yas collapsed to the ground.

I thought he might faint if I lightly shook his head, and it seemed I was right.

<b>

“You bastard… what did you do…?”

“What do you mean? I just flicked your forehead.”

<b>

Kajiwara, who had been red-faced from alcohol until a moment ago, turned pale.

He looked like a pitiful victim who had encountered a creature in a horror movie by bad luck.

<b>

“Then shall I take care of you too?”

“N-no, stop…”

<b>

And so, I flicked Kajiwara’s forehead with the same force as I did with Yas, knocking him out as well.
