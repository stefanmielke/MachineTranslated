# Episode 120: I Decided to Introduce My Sister 2

“Kiritsu, Rei”

““Thank you very much!””

<b>

As I gave the command as the class representative, the end of the return SHR was announced, and while my classmates left the classroom, I let out a big sigh while looking at the paper for the social studies field trip report that was distributed to the group leaders, slumping over my desk.

<b>

“...Shu-kun, are you okay?”

“I might not be okay...”

<b>

In the end, I couldn’t resist the flow created by Rentaro, whether it was intentional or not, and I raised my hand to the next group leader while hanging my head.

...Well, I also thought that I didn’t want to put too much burden on Kyori.

<b>

In any case, what I need to think about is probably supervising the middle school students and making sure the group members write their reports properly after the field trip.

Fortunately, our group members submit their assignments on time, so aside from the anxiety of having Rentaro, I’m not too worried about the latter.

As for Rentaro, I can probably pressure him with a message to make it work.

The problem is how to handle the middle school students.

There’s no way I can know how to interact with a group that’s only two years younger than me and even has my sister in it.

Moreover, it’s troublesome that I’m supposed to be the leader of this combined middle and high school group.

<b>

“Ha...”

<b>

I can only let out a sigh.

Just when I thought I had settled the issue with Alicia, now I’m going to be troubled by something completely different.

<b>

“Um, if you’d like, I can help you out? I know it’s a bit presumptuous, but I think I’m more knowledgeable about being in charge than others.”

<b>

Kyori suggested to me.

<b>

“...Is that okay?”

“If I had stuck to my decision to be the group leader, Shu-kun wouldn’t have to worry like this. Besides... I don’t want to reduce the time I can spend with Shu-kun.”

<b>

Kyori’s cheeks were flushed as she spoke, and I could tell that this “proposal” was embarrassing for her as well.

However, as Kyori said, I also don’t want to reduce the time I can spend with her while being troubled about how to manage the social studies field trip as the group leader.

I raised my hand thinking I didn’t want to burden her, but I’ll accept this invitation honestly.

<b>

“Then, Kyori-sensei, I’ll rely on your guidance.”

“I understand. And please don’t call me ‘sensei’—it’s embarrassing. So, where will we have this consultation?”

“Hmm, how about my house?”

“Y-Your house, Shu-kun!?”

“I also want to be alone with Kyori for a while, and my family won’t be back until 8 PM, so I thought it would be good. Of course, if you don’t want to, we can go somewhere else—”

“I-I don’t mind at all! Let’s do that!”

“Okay, got it. Then after this, we’ll have a consultation at my house. I’ll submit the journal to the teacher, so Kyori, please go ahead to the school gate first.”

“Yes!”

<b>

I was slightly surprised by Kyori’s unexpected enthusiasm for this proposal, but I was happy that I could be alone with her.

The last time she came to my house, we spent so much time dealing with the incident with Ikoma-senpai and studying for tests that we honestly couldn’t get close at all.

So today, I want to fully enjoy being close with Kyori without worrying about the social studies field trip.

Besides, as I told her, my dad won’t be home today, and Kana is at the dojo, and I have time to relax since I’ve already finished shopping.

<b>

“Wow, you seem really cheerful compared to earlier, Shu.”

“Whoa!? D-Don’t scare me like that, Rentaro...”

<b>

Just as I was finishing up my journal and heading to the staff room, Rentaro approached me with a grin.

<b>

“Lucky you—being alone with Kuon-san at home. I’m really envious.”

“...You could switch places with me right now, you know?”

“No way! I’m feeling cramped at school, so I want to have fun without worrying about anything after school.”

<b>

Saying that, Rentaro quickly gathered his things and left the classroom.

He just said what he wanted and ran away... If I get stuck with a troublesome job next time, I’ll definitely drag him into it...!

<b>

(Wait, wait. I have the best event coming up where I get to spend time with Kyori. I should stop wasting time on him.)

<b>

With that thought, I switched my mindset and headed to the staff room to submit the class journal.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

“I’m home!”

“Go ahead, make yourself comfortable. I’ll make some tea.”

“Thank you very much.”

<b>

After submitting the journal to Mr. Koshimizu and reuniting with Kyori, I had walked for about ten minutes before inviting her into my home.

By the second time, Kyori didn’t seem nervous at all, and she was organizing the materials for the social studies field trip that were distributed during today’s pre-study on the living room table.

<b>

“Here’s your tea. I only had green tea, so I went with that. Is that okay?”

“That’s fine. Thank you.”

“Ah, ah.”

<b>

Kyori took the cup and snacks from me, smiling brightly.

I couldn’t help but feel a little flustered by her cuteness as I sat down opposite her.

<b>

“F-For now, we should think about preventing any trouble between our group and the middle school students, right?”

“Right. In that case, it would be good to know more about your sisters... So, how is your relationship with your siblings, Shu-kun?”

“How is it... I think it’s probably normal. There were times when I was a bit spoiled when I was younger, but that doesn’t really happen now.”

<b>

But well, when I was taken to the hospital after that transfer failure, my sister rushed to me, really worried, and even now, she responds normally when I talk to her, so I don’t think it’s bad.

<b>

“...I see. Then what kind of person is your sister?”

“What kind of person is Kana? Hmm, I’d say she has a bit of a competitive side. Other than that, she’s just a really normal girl.”

“I see, I see...”

<b>

Kyori was diligently writing down what I said in a notebook she had taken out from somewhere.

Seeing this side of her, I thought maybe it would have been better to let Kyori be the group leader after all.

Just as I was starting to think that— 

<b>

*“Click”*

“Wha!?”

<b>

Suddenly, I heard the sound of the front door unlocking, and I instinctively took a defensive stance, ready to counter any attack.

With the issues from yesterday with Alicia and this morning with Mr. Koshimizu, I was currently entangled in various troublesome matters.

Moreover, I understood that the organization Alicia belonged to was a powerful group capable of doing just about anything.

Thus, I immediately took a defensive stance, but that anxiety quickly turned into unnecessary worry.

<b>

“I’m home. I was thirsty, so I thought I’d get some juice—huh?”

“Um, I-I’m sorry for intruding...”

<b>

My sister, Kana, who had entered the living room completely in off-mode, froze when she saw Kyori in her uniform with me.
