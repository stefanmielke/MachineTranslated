# Episode 21: After the Monster Extermination 2

"Where is this...?"

<b>

When I woke up, I found myself in the bedroom of some high-end apartment.

A ceiling fan was installed above, and sunlight was streaming in through a large window.

The room's decor was quite simple, with only a bookshelf and a potted plant.

I needed to confirm where I was, so I thought as I sat up, and a wet towel fell from my forehead.

Was someone taking care of me...?

As I pondered this, the door opened with a click.

<b>

"I'm glad. You've woken up."

<b>

Entering the room was Kuon, wearing an apron and holding a basin with a wet towel.

<b>

I finally remembered. After that, I had fainted.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Kuon. I caused you trouble."

"Not at all, there's no need for you to apologize, Iori-kun. More importantly—"

<b>

Kuon placed the basin on a shelf next to the bed and bowed deeply to me.

<b>

"I truly apologize. I put you in such a dangerous situation and now this..."

<b>

Ah, come to think of it, I hadn't explained the skills or MP to Kuon in detail.

So she must think that my fainting from a nosebleed was her fault.

<b>

"No, no, you don't need to worry about it. This was completely my mistake."

"But, but—"

"If you keep apologizing, it makes me feel guilty instead. We didn't get hurt, and we successfully defeated the monster. Isn't that enough?"

"…You're right. I understand."

<b>

Kuon raised her head after saying that, but her face still bore a look of self-reproach.

Hmm, it seems better for me to change the subject.

<b>

"By the way, Kuon, where is this place?"

"Huh? It's my home."

<b>

Huh? Did I mishear that?

I think I just heard Kuon say this was "my home."

<b>

"Ah, right. What about food? Can you eat?"

"Um, if you can offer it, I’d like to have some."

"I understand. Please wait in the living room. Oh, the living room is through the door to the right as you exit the bedroom."

<b>

Perhaps feeling a bit more at ease, Kuon regained her usual demeanor and left the room.

In contrast, I stepped into the hallway with a cold sweat on my back, looking around cautiously.

<b>

(…It’s really quiet here.)

<b>

There was no sign of anyone else besides me and Kuon. It seemed her family was not home.

Realizing this made me feel a bit relieved. I wouldn't know how to react if I ran into Kuon's parents.

<b>

As I entered the living room, a pleasant smell of miso soup wafted through the air.

On the table were miso soup, white rice, pickles, and ham and eggs—a splendid breakfast.

As I sat down, Kuon gestured for me to go ahead.

I put my hands together and said, "Itadakimasu," then immediately dug into the simple miso soup with seaweed and tofu.

<b>

"I hope it suits your taste..."

"It's incredibly delicious. It might be better than the miso soup we make at home."

"Is that so? I'm glad to hear that."

<b>

As I sincerely praised the taste, Kuon blushed.

<b>

"By the way, shouldn't you contact your family?"

"I already told them I was staying at a friend's house, so it's fine. But more importantly, are you sure it was okay to let someone like me into your home? What about your parents—"

"It's fine. I've been living here alone for a long time."

<b>

For just a moment, her tone changed to that coldness I had seen on the first day of the entrance ceremony.

Talking about family was a sensitive topic for Kuon. I should avoid bringing it up any further.

<b>

"Got it. So the yokai like the Ushi-oni won't appear anymore, right?"

"Yes, at least I don't think such things will appear in this town again."

<b>

Hearing those words, I felt a deep sense of relief.

I had been anxious thinking about what would happen if my sister or dad were attacked on their way to and from school...

<b>

After finishing breakfast while chatting about trivial matters and washing the dishes, we finally took a breather.

<b>

"Ah..."

<b>

As I sighed in relief while sipping the tea she had prepared, Kuon sat down across from me with an envelope in hand.

<b>

"This is the reward for your cooperation in the Ushi-oni extermination. Please accept it."

<b>

Feeling a bit intimidated by her overly formal demeanor, I took the envelope and noticed its thickness and the weight inside felt unusual.

It wasn't filled with coins. It was likely all bills. Just how much was inside for it to feel this heavy?

<b>

No, I shouldn't think about it too much; it was starting to scare me.

<b>

"I've put about 1 million yen in that envelope. If you feel it's insufficient, please don't hesitate to let me know."

<b>

Once again, I found myself doubting my ears after an hour.

1 million? Did she just say 1 million yen?

<b>

"No, no! I can't accept such a large sum!"

"The reward for the Ushi-oni extermination is actually quite modest. If you refuse to accept it, it would bring shame to Kuon's name."

<b>

…She definitely won't back down until I accept it.

Reluctantly, I took the offered envelope and stored it in my item box.

<b>

(…Maybe I should buy a new watch with this.)

<b>

Just then, my smartphone rang.

Opening it, I found an angry message from my sister saying, "When are you coming home?"

<b>

"Sorry, Kuon. I think I need to head back soon."

"I understand. Your shoes and belongings are at the entrance of the bedroom."

<b>

I hurriedly finished getting ready to leave and headed to the entrance.

<b>

"See you at school."

"Yes, see you at school."

<b>

Just as I was about to put my hand on the door.

<b>

"—Iori-kun!"

"Huh?"

"Thank you so, so much!"

<b>

I turned back, surprised by her sudden call, and Kuon bowed deeply, a big smile on her face.

<b>

"O-okay."

<b>

I answered, trying to hide my embarrassment by looking down, and left Kuon's house.

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was about thirty minutes later that I finally arrived back in my room.

Even though I had only been away for a few hours, I felt an odd sense of nostalgia. Was that just my imagination?

<b>

"Well then."

<b>

I lightly thought of "Status."
