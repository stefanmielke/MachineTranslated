# Chapter 102: The Preparations for the Cultural Festival Have Begun 5

"Alisia, are you okay right now?"

"I'm fine, but did something happen?"

"Ah, it is indeed a problem... For now, I'll switch to video call and show you."

<b>

As I dodged the poison and electric shocks being spewed out using 'Body Enhancement,' I showed Alisia the creature's form through my smartphone's video call feature.

<b>

"---What?"

"This guy is the true identity of the giant serpent, probably, or rather definitely, a Mongolian Death Worm, a UMA. It seems it was suddenly brought to Japan through some ability and is now in a panic."

"No way, wait... That's not a doll you made, right?"

"It's a real UMA. It's neither a giant serpent nor a yokai. Well, it's getting tough, so I'm going to turn off the video function."

<b>

As I said that and operated my smartphone, the moment I jumped off the ground, the flowers that had been growing where I was standing instantly withered due to the purple poison slime expelled by the giant UMA.

<b>

"What should I do about this? Is it okay to just take it down?"

"…Wait, I've received reports from my subordinates. Yes, you can take it down. Unfortunately, we can't procure a cage to contain a creature of that size right away."

"Got it. Then I'll clean this up quickly."

"And I'll head over there soon, so don't return immediately after defeating it."

"Okay, I'm hanging up now."

<b>

With that, I cut the call button on my smartphone and shoved it into my pants pocket, then shifted my gaze to the enemy in front of me.

<b>

'---!!!'

"Whoa, that was close..."

<b>

Letting out a sound that couldn't even be called a voice, it threatened me while unleashing poison and electric shocks from its mouth, leaving me with no escape on the ground. I jumped into the air and used its massive body to slam down.

From the previous exchanges, I had grasped the general patterns of its movements.

The biggest problem was indeed that long-range attack combining poison and electricity. That landing ambush was the most annoying.

So first, I needed to deal with that disgusting mouth.

<b>

'---!!!'

<b>

The giant UMA once again spewed electric shocks and poison slime from its mouth.

I lightly jumped back to dodge it, activated 'Ice Magic,' and generated an extremely thin, hard, and long thread, throwing it to wrap around the body near the giant UMA's head.

Then, using 'Body Enhancement,' I slipped under the giant UMA, and this time, I generated an extremely solid and heavy giant ice block, tying the previously created thread to it.

<b>

'---!!'

<b>

I don't know how it perceives the surrounding situation, but it seemed the giant UMA realized it had lost sight of its enemy.

It turned its massive mouth towards me and once again spewed electric shocks and poison slime.

In response, I dodged the attack in exactly the same way as before, created an ice thread, wrapped it around its body, and tied it to the newly generated giant ice block, performing the actions with a sense of routine.

<b>

'---!? ---!!'

<b>

After repeating that several times, the area near the head of the Mongolian Death Worm was tightly constricted by the embedded threads, causing blood and slime to drip down.

<b>

(Alright, let's move on to the finishing touches.)

<b>

I further coated the ice thread and block with 'Ice Magic,' increasing their strength.

At the same time, the giant UMA began to expel a mixture of poison slime and blood from its grotesque teeth.

<b>

'---!!!?'

<b>

Eventually, its head was shattered like a diced steak, scattering red pieces of flesh covered in bodily fluids on the ground.

All that remained was the body, revealing its internal structure from the cross-section.

<b>

I activated Ice Magic again and generated an ice hammer the size of an average house. Grabbing it while activating 'Body Enhancement,' I swung it high.

<b>

"This is the end!"

<b>

As I shouted that and brought the ice hammer down, half of the Mongolian Death Worm's body became a stain on the ground, completely motionless.

<b>

"...It's dead, right?"

<b>

Confirming that the monster was completely dead with 'Identification,' I let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"The total amount of subjugation experience has reached the required value. Leveling up will occur."

<b>

A voice announcing my level-up echoed in my mind, and the dizziness from physical fatigue and MP consumption completely vanished.

<b>

(…It's been a while since I heard that voice.)

<b>

Thinking that, I immediately focused on 'Status' in my mind.

―――

<b>

Compared to my previous status, MP, STR, and AGI have all increased significantly.

The earlier voice mentioned, "The total amount of subjugation experience has reached the required value," but could it be that the stats that increase upon leveling up change depending on the opponent faced?

No, I'll save the speculation for when I get back and calm down.

For now, I'll just be happy that my level has increased.

<b>

(I've also accumulated quite a few skill points, so maybe it's time to learn a completely new skill?)

<b>

With that thought, I displayed the skill list and waited for Alisia's arrival while browsing through the skills like a product catalog.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

About 30 minutes after defeating the giant UMA.

Having grown tired of looking at the skill catalog and sniping mosquitoes with 'Water Magic,' a large helicopter landed in the square.

Once the helicopter's rotor stopped and the loud noise subsided, Alisia emerged from the cockpit door and approached me.

<b>

"I'm sorry for being late. I got held up with preparations."

"I don't mind, it's fine. Still, you came in on something amazing again."

"The corpses of unidentified creatures from abroad are incredibly valuable research materials. I've been instructed to recover as much as we can."

<b>

As Alisia spoke, a group in protective suits descended from the helicopter's rear door, cutting up the corpse of the Mongolian Death Worm and placing its flesh into storage containers.

Moreover, soldiers in camouflage uniforms, bulletproof vests, and carrying rifles were guarding the area around the group performing the disassembly and recovery work.

<b>

"Are those people part of the organization Alisia belongs to?"

"Technically, yes. The command structure is entirely separate, though."

"Huh, that sounds like a hassle."

"Yeah, it's actually very troublesome."

<b>

Alisia's eyes were completely serious as she spoke.

Seeing that, I thought about how tough it must be to work in a government job, when a tough-looking man in a black suit came running towards us.

<b>

"Administrator, I have something to report."

"…Understood. Sorry, I need to step away for a moment."

"Okay."

<b>

Ah, at this rate, it seems I won't be able to go home just yet.

I promised to go to school with Kyori tomorrow, so I'd like to return quickly if possible.

As I was thinking that, Alisia returned to me holding a tablet, her expression looking even more serious than before.

<b>

"What's wrong? Did something happen?"

"First, take a look at this footage."

<b>

Doing as instructed, I peered at the tablet, where I saw Ikoma-senpai in her pajamas descending the mountain at night.

Given her unsteady gait, she was likely not in her right mind.

<b>

"This was just captured by a surveillance camera at the foot of the mountain. What do you think?"

"She either sleepwalked her way here by coincidence, or she was drawn here by some ability or something. I think it's probably one of those two. Just a layman's guess, though."

"Well, it's likely one of those options..."

<b>

As I thought that, I recalled Ikoma-senpai's words.

<b>

"Hey, do you know what content Ikoma-senpai was watching recently? Like when I extracted information from my game console or the surveillance camera at the station."

"It seems you have a thought in mind. Alright, I'll check it out."

<b>

As I returned the tablet to Alisia, she quickly operated it to arrange the content Ikoma-senpai had watched recently in chronological order, even displaying the viewing times on the screen.

There were otome games, along with their fan creations, romantic manga, and even BL manga, all of which made it hard to know where to look, but I ignored them all.

<b>

"...This!"

<b>

The content Ikoma-senpai had watched the longest recently was an original manga about a girl who falls in love with a giant serpent feared as a mountain god.

And the ability that was tormenting Ikoma-senpai, could it be...?

<b>

"I think that Death Worm was summoned to bring the serpent god from this manga into reality through the ability that Ikoma-senpai mentioned."

"Wait, wait. A snake and an earthworm are completely different things, right?!"

"But until it actually appeared, it was rumored to be a giant serpent monster. And I heard from Kyori that yokai are born from people's fears and beliefs, right? Judging by how the rumors have spread, it's highly likely that the Death Worm will soon transform from a UMA into a snake yokai or god. And Ikoma-senpai unconsciously came to this mountain to realize her fantasy of becoming the heroine of this manga. What do you think?"

"That could theoretically be possible... If that's the case..."

<b>

Hearing my hypothesis, Alisia fell deep into thought.

<b>

"Well, I know I just said it, but please don't take my words too seriously as they're just a hypothesis or a stretch. More importantly, we need to ensure Ikoma-senpai's safety—"

"Don't worry about that. I've already instructed my subordinates, so it's fine. But I just thought we need to consider the worst-case scenario."

"The worst-case scenario?"

"That she awakens to an ability later in life, and her aptitude for that ability is extremely low."

<b>

Oh, a new term has come up again?

<b>

"What happens if a person with low aptitude for that ability awakens to it? I can tell just from the wording that it's not going to be good."

"First, they simply won't be able to control their ability. So they'll continue to activate their ability even beyond their physical and mental limits. And abilities, without exception, grow stronger the more they're used, which increases the burden on the body and mind. Then, this cycle continues until their mind and body collapse."

<b>

Activating an ability beyond one's limits... For me, it would be like activating a skill without having enough required MP.

When I first gained my status, I had activated skills that I didn't have enough MP for several times for research purposes, but at that time, I was overwhelmed by tremendous dizziness, nausea, and headaches, and I passed out every time.

If that happens involuntarily, it would undoubtedly be hell itself.

<b>

However...

<b>

"Ikoma-senpai hasn't shown any signs of poor health, though?"

"That's true. So this is still just a possibility. But—"

<b>

Alisia looked at the corpse of the Death Worm being loaded into a large helicopter in a specialized containment case with a stern expression and muttered.

<b>

"Regardless of the purpose, an ability that can summon a creature of that scale across mountains, seas, and countries is undoubtedly abnormal. We must remain vigilant."

"Yeah..."

<b>

At that moment, I realized something, or rather, I couldn't help but realize it.

<b>

"Ah, by the way, what about my aptitude for abilities? Is there a chance of a rampage or anything like that happening—"

"You're among the highest class of confirmed ability users, so don't worry."

<b>

I felt relieved that my anxiety was dispelled, but at the same time, another question arose.

<b>

"Highest class? Are you serious?"

"Your ability has been continuously improving, and despite frequently using it, you maintain a sound human nature. It's impressive that you can still converse with me like this even after two years of power without succumbing to it."

"I see?"

"Rather, your adaptability is abnormally high? That itself could indicate the possibility of another ability...? No, but..."

"Hey, Alisia?"

<b>

While we were talking, Alisia seemed to drift into her own world.

When I waved my hand in front of her face, she snapped back to reality.

<b>

"Oh, I'm sorry. Anyway, you don't need to worry or stress about it."

"I understand. Then I'll take comfort in that. Oh."

<b>

A man who appeared to be Alisia's subordinate approached and whispered to her.

Looking over, the corpse of the Death Worm had completely disappeared. It seemed the disassembly and recovery work was finished.

<b>

"I received a report that the work is complete. You can go home now."

"Alright, I'll take my leave. Ah, I'm tired..."

"Thank you for your hard work."

<b>

With that, Alisia headed towards the large helicopter.

As I saw her off, I began to relax my body and prepare to activate my skill to return home.

<b>

(…Just in case, I should tell Kyori to keep an eye on Ikoma-senpai.)

<b>

Thinking that, I activated 'Spatial Transfer Magic.'
