# Episode 85: The Ritual Has Begun 5

『Kishaaaaaa!!』

<b>

The second layer of the labyrinth barrier, which is a lake covered with lotus leaves.

There, a gigantic newcomer snake made entirely of water, reigning as if it were the master of this land, attacked us as we tried to run through with all our might, aiming to swallow us whole.

<b>

“I-Iori-san! Behind! Behind!”

“It's okay, it's okay. I'll handle it, so just hold on tight and don't let go, alright!”

<b>

Using the extraordinarily sturdy lotus leaves as a foothold, I glanced back to check the situation.

<b>

(I can roughly predict its behavior patterns. If it’s going to strike...)

<b>

The giant water snake aimed for the moment we were about to land and opened its massive mouth wide.

<b>

“Here, now!”

<b>

I immediately jumped up with 'Wind Magic' and activated 'Ice Magic' against the giant water snake in contact with the lotus leaves.

<b>

『Gya…………』

<b>

In an instant, the water snake turned into a massive block of ice, lying on the surface of the water where countless lotus leaves floated.

The shock generated was sufficient to shatter the frozen giant water snake, scattering ice crystals all around.

At the same time, perhaps because the enormous obstacle had disappeared, a particularly large lotus leaf connected to the upper layer came into view.

<b>

“...The next one is the final layer.”

<b>

If possible, I would like to reach the control panel without any incidents, but that probably won't happen.

There is the root cause of this disaster ahead. Who knows what twisted traps lie in wait?

<b>

“Both of you, absolutely do not step in front of me.”

““Yes!””

<b>

After advising the siblings I was carrying, I dashed up the spiral staircase.

In just a few minutes, we finished climbing the stairs and arrived in front of a heavy-looking stone double door.

<b>

I’ve encountered demons and snakes, but I wonder what will appear this time.

While pondering this, I placed my hand on the door and slowly opened it.

<b>

(What is this place?)

<b>

As I passed through the door, I found myself in a place resembling the backstage of a theater, dimly illuminated by red light.

Mysterious objects of unknown purpose were scattered here and there, some piled up.

<b>

(If I proceed carelessly, I might get ambushed by monsters from the blind spots...)

<b>

Thinking this, I created several reconnaissance drones and sent them flying deeper into the area.

It would have been great if I could find the goal with some luck, but within minutes, all the drones stopped responding.

<b>

(As expected, it doesn't go that smoothly.)

<b>

However, confirming that there were no monsters in the vicinity was a sufficient achievement.

<b>

“...Alright.”

<b>

I slowly stepped into the darkness.

Of course, I didn’t let my guard down and deployed the armed drones I had prepared and stored in my travel bag in the item box.

<b>

“Stop!”

<b>

After walking in the darkness for a while, I heard footsteps and breathing approaching us.

As I pushed the armed drones forward and shouted loudly, a familiar voice replied, “Wait, wait!”

<b>

Could it be? I thought, but I kept the drones' barrels aimed just in case and turned on my phone's light towards the source of the voice.

<b>

“Don't shoot! We are humans! We're not demons!”

<b>

There stood a flustered Kuuon Koharu, asking me to stop, and――.

<b>

(I never expected to reunite like this...)

<b>

She was supporting the unconscious Kuuon Kyori, who was in a dazed state.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

“Well, this should do.”

<b>

I deployed a massive bubble membrane with recognition interference and soundproofing functions using 'Water Magic' around us and looked at the three glaring at each other behind me.

<b>

“What the hell are that brat from that old man's place doing here?”

“That’s what I want to know. You’re the delinquent girl, Koharu.”

“I don’t know how you got acquainted, but don’t get too familiar with Iori-san!”

“Haah!?”

<b>

<b>

...It seems I should set up another soundproof bubble wall.

While feeling exasperated inside, I shifted my gaze to the lying Kuuon Kyori, who was breathing heavily.

<b>

(‘Appraisal’)

<b>

――――

<b>

Kuuon Kyori, Human, 16 years old

<b>

Condition: Symptoms include headache, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, and lack of physical strength.

Supplement: Affected by the spell cast within the barrier, drained of power by Kuuon Genji, resulting in both physical and mental exhaustion.

<b>

―――

<b>

For now, it doesn’t seem to be a critical condition. With this, 'Healing Magic' should be able to help.

However...

<b>

(Kuuon Genji drained her power... What does that mean?)

<b>

According to 'Appraisal', it says “due to the spell cast within the barrier,” but such a phenomenon hasn’t occurred with me, Koharu, or the siblings who are bickering with her.

Is there some condition? Or is it――.

<b>

(First, treating Kyori is the top priority.)

<b>

I activated the skill 'Healing Magic' on Kyori, and her previously pained expression gradually softened.

However, it seems she hasn’t fully regained consciousness yet.

In this case, the person to talk to is...

<b>

I silently stepped between Koharu and the siblings, forcing them to stop their quarrel, and turned to Koharu.

<b>

“Koharu, you came from deeper inside, right? Then you must know what’s happening ahead?”

“...Kuuon Genji was sucking blood or something from other people and was about to become a monster. Kyori-onee-sama was the first to be preyed upon, and then he drained power from others in order of strength, and then...”

<b>

She must have witnessed something terrifying or experienced something dreadful. Koharu trembled as she spoke.

<b>

“However, I happened to have a chance and managed to escape with my sister. That’s when I ran into you guys.”

<b>

Seeing her frightened demeanor, the siblings who had been bickering just moments ago fell silent.

In hindsight, perhaps their quarrel was a way to avert their eyes from their fear.

<b>

“I’m sorry. For reminding you of something scary.”

“It's fine. If it means we can rescue Kyori-onee-sama...”

<b>

<b>

『Where are youuuuuuuuu!? Kyoriiiiiiiiiiiii!?』

<b>

At that moment, a scream pierced through the bubble wall, accompanied by red mist, reaching us.

<b>

“Was that voice... Genji-sama...?”

“Could it be that what Koharu said is true...?”

<b>

While I was reinforcing the barrier with 'Water Magic', the siblings panicked at the sudden occurrence.

Given the tone of the voice, it’s better to assume that Kuuon Genji, or rather, the one who was Kuuon Genji, had almost lost all reason.

In that case, there’s only one course of action.

<b>

“I’m going to punch that idiot who caused this situation. You all stay here and keep an eye on Kyori’s condition...”

“――No, please let me go too.”

<b>

When I turned around at the unexpected voice, I saw Kyori, still unsteady on her feet but managing to stand up on her own.

<b>

“No, wait. It’s reckless to fight a monster in that condition.”

“That’s right, Onee-sama! If you get your power drained again...!”

“...I’m sorry for worrying you, Iori-kun, Koharu-chan. But I’m really fine. Besides――”

<b>

Kyori cast a strong gaze toward the depths of the layer, which had become even more obscured by the red mist.

<b>

“I’m probably the only one who can stop this abnormal situation. So please, take me deeper, to Kuuon Genji.”

<b>

With that, Kyori bowed her head to me.

<b>

“Kyori-onee-sama! Going to that place in your condition is reckless! We should think of a way to escape right now!”

“This is a problem I must resolve, so I can’t just run away.”

<b>

If I truly care for Kyori, I should reject her request.

However, there was a certain persuasiveness in her words, and more than anything, it felt like a glimmer of hope in this dark situation.

<b>

“Alright. But absolutely no recklessness.”

“...Yes!”

<b>

Upon hearing my response, Kyori immediately tore off part of her kimono to make it easier to move.

<b>

Meanwhile, Koharu approached me with a serious expression.

<b>

“Hey, take me with you. I can’t just leave Kyori-onee-sama behind and stay in a safe place.”

“No. I don’t have the capacity to protect multiple people.”

“...Then I’ll go in place of Kyori-onee-sama!”

“Koharu.”

<b>

When I locked eyes with her, Koharu took a step back, as if intimidated.

<b>

“This is our limit. You two stay here and wait for everything to be resolved. Got it?”

“...I understand.”

<b>

Koharu squeezed out those words and immediately continued with, “But!”

<b>

“Make sure to come back together without hurting Onee-sama.”

“Yeah, I got it. I promise.”

<b>

Finally, it seemed she had come to terms with it, and Koharu stepped away from me.

Now then.

<b>

“Kyori, you’re really okay, right?”

“I’m really fine. So please, Iori-kun, trust me and leave it to me.”

<b>

Prepared, we stood side by side.

Honestly, my worries and anxieties hadn’t been dispelled even a little, but since Kyori said to trust her, I would.

<b>

“In ten seconds, I’ll blow away the mist and we’ll rush straight to the source of that voice. Brace yourselves.”

“I understand. ...Oh, and one more thing.”

<b>

As I was preparing to activate 'Wind Magic', Kyori seemed to notice something and murmured.

<b>

“Since it’s confusing to call me Kuuon here, please call me Kyori from now on.”

“I got it, Kuu... Kyori.”

“Fufu, it seems it will take some time to get used to.”

“I-I’ll do my best.”

<b>

With that exchange easing the tension, we once again focused on the darkness shrouded in red mist.

<b>

<b>

『Where are youuuuuuuuu!? Where are youuuuuuuuuuu!? Kyoriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!』

<b>

“Stop screaming and be quiet for a bit. The person is saying they’re coming now...!”

<b>

Then, I burst out of the bubble and immediately activated 'Wind Magic' at maximum power to blow away the red mist, simultaneously flying toward the source of the voice.
