# Episode 22: Encounter with the Blonde Transfer Student

"Ah, I'm so tired..."

<b>

A month after the defeat of the Ushi-Oni, the results of the midterm exams were finally returned, and I was able to relax my shoulders.

Thanks to the "Universal Translation," I could manage without studying for English and classical literature, but math and physics were another story.

However, I was able to increase my study time for my weak subjects, so my scores this time were quite good for someone like me, who is completely humanities-oriented.

<b>

"Shuu, how did you do on the tests?"

"Not bad. What about Rentarou?"

"Hahaha, it was really bad."

<b>

As he said that, showing me his barely passing or failing exam paper, Rentarou's face turned pale.

Well, I figured that would happen, and when I looked around, I noticed quite a few boys with similarly pale faces after receiving their test results, and the average scores were significantly low.

<b>

Let me clarify from the start, this school is not particularly famous as a prestigious school, nor are the tests exceptionally difficult.

If you take regular notes in class and study normally for the tests, you should be able to avoid failing.

Yet, the reason so many students ended up with low averages and failing grades can be somewhat inferred by looking at the faces of those who are pale.

<b>

<b>

The week after the Ushi-Oni defeat, I went to school as usual, and as expected, my classmates began to question me about the memo incident.

In response, I had Kuon back me up and lied that I was "just helping out with a part-time job," but even so, some students remained suspicious, and I braced myself, thinking, "Is this the end of my peaceful high school life?"

<b>

However, just three days later, an event occurred that overshadowed the incident between me and Kuon.

One of the boys in this class started dating a girl from another school.

It was only natural for the class's interest to shift from the mere suspicion surrounding us to the boy who had actually started dating.

<b>

Up to this point, it would have simply been a temporary commotion about one classmate getting a girlfriend, but the story doesn't end there.

Before long, another classmate also started dating a girl from another school.

In just one week, an abnormal situation arose where a total of five classmates, including Rentarou, ended up with girlfriends.

They then talked about their girlfriends so much that other students lost interest in romantic gossip, spending time on dates even during the exam period.

And that resulted in this mess.

<b>

"Well, good luck with the finals."

"Yeah..."

<b>

I placed my hand on Rentarou's shoulder to encourage him and began to prepare to leave.

<b>

"Did you hear? Myan-chan got first place in all subjects!?"

"Her entrance exam results were no joke."

"Hey, hey, can we study together for the finals!?"

<b>

"Sure, sounds good. Let's all aim for good scores."

<b>

When I turned around, I saw Kuon happily chatting with her female friends.

Maybe now that the Ushi-Oni incident was resolved and the burden was lifted, Kuon's expression seemed somewhat calmer compared to the day of the entrance ceremony.

Ignoring that scene, I left the classroom.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

(Oh no, I left something in the audiovisual room)

<b>

As I was about to change my shoes at the entrance, I remembered something important.

This morning, I had forgotten my notebook in the audiovisual room on the first floor of the second building, which also serves as the clubroom building.

There's nothing embarrassing written in it, but I wanted to avoid being scolded by a teacher later.

I turned on my heel and hurried to the audiovisual room.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Is it a light blue notebook? Could it be this one?"

"That's it! I'm sorry for the trouble!"

<b>

Fortunately, it seemed that a senior from the film club, which uses the audiovisual room as their clubroom, had found my notebook first, saving me the trouble of searching unnecessarily.

<b>

I bowed to the senior and started walking back toward the entrance.

<b>

"Hm?"

<b>

There, I spotted a Japanese girl and a blonde girl who looked like she was half from another country wandering around the hallway.

The uniform was from this school, but I had never seen someone like her before.

She seemed to be in some trouble, so I thought I might as well approach her.

I activated my skill "Universal Translation" and spoke to her in English.

<b>

"Is something wrong?"

"Oh, thank you. But you don't need to speak in English."

<b>

She can speak Japanese. Then there's no need to activate the skill.

<b>

"I see. You seemed to be having some trouble, so is there something wrong?"

"I can't find the staff room. I've been looking around this building but can't find it."

<b>

Not knowing where the staff room is means this person is probably visiting this school for the first time today.

No, I shouldn't pry too much.

<b>

"This is the second building. The staff room is in the adjacent first building. Would you like me to show you? It's really just right there."

"Thank you, that would help. Oh, and you don't need to use honorifics. We're probably in the same grade."

"Then I'll do that."

<b>

With that, I led her to the staff room.

As I mentioned, the distance from here to the staff room isn't very far.

Even if I carefully explained the route, we could arrive in less than five minutes.

<b>

"...So, if you turn right here, the staff room is right there."

"Oh, it's really close."

<b>

The blonde girl put her hand to her mouth in surprise.

Well, I've guided her enough by now.

<b>

"That really helped. If I hadn't met you, I would have been wandering around that building forever."

"You're exaggerating. Well then, I'll be going."

"Oh, wait. Let me ask your name before you go."

<b>

Now that I think about it, I hadn't introduced myself yet.

<b>

"I'm Iori Shuu. My last name is Iori, and my first name is Shuu."

"…Iori Shuu, got it. When we meet next time, let me treat you for today."

"You don't need to thank me for something like this. By the way, what's your name?"

<b>

She placed her hand on her ample chest and replied.

<b>

"I'm Alicia Kamori. Sorry for taking up your time. See you later!"

<b>

With that, she flashed a big smile and ran off to the staff room.

<b>

Watching Alicia's behavior, I thought she would probably be popular among the boys, and I headed toward the entrance with a carefree mind.

<b>

"Hm. So that's Iori Shuu, huh?"
