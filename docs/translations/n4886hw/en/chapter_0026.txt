# Episode 23: A Certain Agent's Flashback

――Two months ago.

<b>

"That's why I really saw it! That monster knocked Yas out cold with just a flick on the forehead!"

"Okay, okay, I got it. So—"

<b>

In a dimly lit conference room, a huge screen was set up in one corner of the wall.

The footage displayed was of Kajiwara, a former junior high school teacher and suspect in a student attempted rape case that occurred a year and a half ago, being interrogated by the police.

Kajiwara desperately spoke about what he had seen and experienced, but the detective completely ignored him.

This was to be expected.

Logically speaking, a 14-year-old child could not possibly knock out an adult with just a finger flick to the forehead.

<b>

"It's true! The door was covered in ice, and I couldn't get outside!"

"Yes, yes, I understand. So—"

<b>

Next, the footage showed the victim's mother, Mika Fujisawa, who had been complicit in the crime, being interrogated.

Similarly, the detective treated her as if she were invisible.

This response also seemed reasonable.

It was simply unrealistic for a door measuring 2.5 meters in height and 1.5 meters in width to be frozen solid.

<b>

Thus, it seemed only natural for the police to conclude that they had been drunk and hallucinating.

<b>

With that, the light from the projector faded, and the screen returned to its original plain white.

<b>

"So, what do you want me to do with this?"

<b>

As the lights returned to the room, a girl with glossy, straight, golden hair spoke somewhat irritably to the man in a black suit sitting across from her.

Given the girl's previous schedule, this seemed entirely reasonable.

<b>

Having just returned from a long-term special mission abroad, she was suddenly called in to watch such bizarre footage. It was understandable that she would want to voice her dissatisfaction.

<b>

"Now, now, just hear me out until the end."

<b>

The man in the black suit said soothingly to the girl and took a brown envelope from his bag, handing it to her.

When the girl opened the envelope, it contained a list of foreign agents captured over the past few months, as well as mercenaries or gang members who had likely been subcontracted.

Seeing this, the girl's expression turned serious.

<b>

"Did something special happen while I was away from Japan?"

"No, we hardly did anything. All we did was some information manipulation and transportation."

"Then who exactly captured these people?"

<b>

In response to the girl's question, the man in the black suit operated the projector again, projecting footage onto the screen.

<b>

It was a video of four armed foreign mercenaries conducting some sort of operation.

<b>

"This was captured by surveillance cameras about three weeks ago. They were hired by a certain country's government agents, and during the operation, they inserted false footage into the surrounding surveillance equipment, which is why it took us time to notice."

"You really messed up, didn't you?"

"I have no excuse for that. But showing you this video isn't just to expose our foolishness."

"Of course. Now, play the rest."

<b>

Prompted by the girl, the man in the black suit resumed the video that he had paused for explanation.

Having likely been through many situations, the men moved with familiarity.

At that moment, the girl realized she hadn’t asked the crucial question.

<b>

"Now that I think about it, what was their objective? From the looks of their armament, it seems like they were either guarding someone or aiming for an assassination..."

"No, neither of those. Their objective was kidnapping."

"…With that much heavy armament, they were going for a kidnapping?"

"Well, you'll understand the details if you watch the rest."

<b>

In the video, the men stationed at their posts waited patiently for someone.

<b>

What appeared was an average Japanese middle school boy wearing a school uniform, holding a supermarket plastic bag in one hand.

<b>

His physique was neither large nor small, neither fat nor thin; he was just an average Japanese boy.

<b>

Seeing this, the commander-like man in the lead signaled to his comrades in the back and was about to move in for the capture when suddenly.

<b>

"…!?"

<b>

The boy seemed to teleport, moving at super speed to take the man from behind and effortlessly throw him to the asphalt.

<b>

In the face of this abnormal situation, the man in the back instinctively drew his handgun and aimed it at the boy, but for some reason, he didn’t pull the trigger.

<b>

Immediately after, the man who had fallen to the ground began to writhe as if struggling against something, eventually losing consciousness.

<b>

Meanwhile, another man positioned at a height with a sniper rifle attempted to take aim at the boy.

Just as he was about to pull the trigger, the rifle he held was suddenly encased in ice, along with half of his body, without any warning.

<b>

Perhaps terrified by the abnormal situation that had befallen his comrade, or maybe having received some sort of instruction,

a young man at the back desperately tried to escape.

However, he didn’t move a single step forward, merely acting as if he were running in place.

Eventually, the man fired all rounds from his handgun into a concrete wall and collapsed as if he had run out of strength.

<b>

The boy, who hadn’t moved an inch from where he had first taken down the commander, confirmed that all of them were unconscious and gathered them in one spot.

Then, when the boy held his hand over them, the injuries and ice that the men had sustained vanished as if nothing had ever happened.

The boy bound the men tightly with a rope he had produced from somewhere and moved off-screen.

<b>

The video ended there.

<b>

"Now, after watching this, what do you think?"

"Honestly, I thought it was a low-grade horror movie or some kind of action film. But this actually happened in reality, didn’t it?"

"That's right. That boy with supernatural abilities does indeed exist."

<b>

Saying this, the man in the black suit rewound the video and paused it at the moment when the boy conjured ice.

<b>

"This is an unknown power that differs from any existing magic or supernatural ability. No country or organization would not want it. However, all of them failed to capture the boy because of the power he possesses."

"Could it be that the list from earlier..."

"As you guessed, everyone on that list was taken down by this boy."

<b>

The girl felt dizzy from the utterly unrealistic story.

She knew that things like magic and supernatural abilities existed and had even seen them with her own eyes.

But this was a different matter.

Among those on the list were individuals who were even more heavily armed, as well as those who specialized in magic or supernatural abilities.

If there was someone who could take them on unilaterally, it would be—

<b>

"I'll ask you one more time. What exactly do you want me to do? You can't possibly want me to end up like them."

"That's the last thing we want. Do you know how much it has cost us to train you, and how much the Japanese government has invested?"

<b>

The man in the black suit drew a large circle around the bottom of the list he had handed to the girl, which indicated a total of 125 individuals.

<b>

"While it includes those who were simply attacked out of personal grudges or low-level yakuza members who were subcontracted, still, a considerable number of agents were captured by us. Wise countries and organizations will no longer attempt to take him by force, nor could they even execute such plans."

"But they won't stop trying to take him, will they?"

"Ah, from now on, they will try their utmost to lure the boy. I want you to take care of those pesky insects."

"So, they won't try to kill this boy?"

"The fact that these 125 individuals exist is proof that it is impossible."

<b>

The girl exhaled deeply, realizing what the man in the black suit was trying to make her do.

<b>

"So, what kind of scenario will you use to approach him?"

"Just transfer to the high school the boy plans to attend and keep an eye on him as much as possible. If any pesky insects come close, dispose of them without mercy."

<b>

Saying this, the man handed the girl a stack of documents.

These were the details of the identity she would assume for the next three years.

<b>

"Well then, I look forward to working with you for the next three years, 'Alicia Kamori.'"

"Sure, I’ll do my best. 'Hirata'."
