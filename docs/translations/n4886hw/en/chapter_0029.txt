# Episode 26: I Tried Out an Extra Skill 3

"Do you know that girl?"

<b>

Noticing my reaction, Kuon asked.

<b>

"I've never met her in person. But you know, right? A month ago, there was a story about the boys in our class suddenly getting girlfriends. One of them showed me his girlfriend, and it was her."

"Ah..."

<b>

Perhaps recalling that love affair incident, or rather, having been reminded of it, she wore a mixed expression of understanding and a wry smile.

<b>

"If that's the case, why is she here...?"

"Who knows? I think it's safe to say it's not for a good reason."

<b>

While saying that, I activated 'Appraisal' on Rentaro's girlfriend.

<b>

―――

<b>

Asahina Aoi, Human, 15 years old

Status: Hypnosis, Fatigue, Memory Loss

Notes: She is in a hypnotic state due to magic cast within a group chat.

Additionally, her body is exhausted due to part of her memory being siphoned off.

<b>

―――

<b>

Hypnosis, brainwashing, and on top of that, magic, huh?

I had thought that since exorcists and youkai really exist, magic must be real too.

<b>

"Kuon, can you still sense that youki?"

"…That's the strange part."

"Strange, in what way?"

<b>

Kuon murmured while staring blankly at the girl sitting in front of her.

<b>

"I can sense the same youki from the people sitting here. It's as if I've inhaled something that was crushed from a single youkai..."

<b>

Sensing it from within? What on earth does that mean?

<b>

*Click*

<b>

I heard the sound of a doorknob turning from a room deeper inside.

I hid behind the sofa with Kuon and peeked at the person entering the room from the shadows.

<b>

"Oh, looks like all twelve of us are here today."

"Until a little while ago, the students were in their exam period. That must have made it hard to gather everyone."

"In any case, this means we won't have to deal with complaints from the client."

<b>

The newcomers were a middle-aged man in a black jacket with short hair and a young man in a flashy tracksuit.

They approached the table placed between the sofas and peered into the glass jar fixed on top.

<b>

"Alright, it's properly accumulated."

"I have a question that's a bit late, but what is this? I was only told to bring it once it had accumulated to a certain extent..."

"How would I know? I've heard it's something that 'siphons' materials for new goods."

<b>

From the conversation, it seemed those men had no idea what was happening here or what was being done to them.

That means I need to investigate that glass jar.

<b>

(*Appraisal*)

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Glass Jar

Status: Good

Notes: It is enchanted with automatic recovery and memory recall magic circles, and it contains liquidized happy memories that have been collected.

If the target is destroyed, those memories will return to their owner.

<b>

―――

<b>

So they are being gathered here through hypnosis and having their happy memories siphoned away?

If that's the case, for what purpose?

<b>

"By the way, I saw some kids being carried out through the back door the other day. What was that about?"

"Oh, apparently someone went beyond their limits and became a husk. So they were taken outside."

"Husk!? What happens then!?"

"They become a lump of flesh that can't do anything, lying in bed and continuously soiling themselves. Once that happens, we can't 'recover' them anymore, so make sure to manage these guys properly. They're valuable goods."

"Y-Yes!"

<b>

Saying that, they tried to remove the glass jar.

<b>

"…What do you think people are...?"

<b>

At that moment, I noticed Kuon trembling with rage beside me.

<b>

"Kuon, what should we do?"

<b>

Thanks to the recognition-inhibiting magic, they shouldn't be able to perceive the sounds we make, but I still dared to ask in a low voice.

<b>

"What do you mean, what should we do?"

"Should we knock that bastard out and rescue the people here, or—"

"…We will rescue them. No, please let us rescue them."

<b>

I love a simple answer like that.

Then my response will be this.

<b>

"Skill Lending."

"！ This is…"

"Sorry, but I've almost used up all the fuel needed to use skills during the movement up to this point. So please use 'Body Enhancement' at the crucial moment."

"…Understood."

<b>

Then we took another step forward.

There should still be about 20 minutes before the effect of the recognition-inhibiting magic wears off.

Let's decide quickly during that time.

<b>

"Kuon, go around to the other side and feel free to smash that glass jar. I'll take care of those guys."

"Yes. I'll leave that to you."

<b>

After sending a hand signal, we jumped out from behind the sofa all at once.

<b>

"Wh-!? Who are these guys!?"

<b>

The man in the jacket screamed upon seeing me.

To them, we must look like monsters with blurred faces wearing clothes, and they can't perceive our footsteps, breathing, or voices at all.

If something like that suddenly appeared from the darkness, it would be no surprise they were scared.

<b>

"Damn it!"

<b>

One of the men pulled out a handgun from inside his jacket and aimed it at me.

<b>

(*Body Enhancement*)

<b>

Just before the man could pull the trigger, I activated 'Body Enhancement' to accelerate and slipped into his embrace.

<b>

"Ugh."

"Guah!?"

<b>

I struck the man's jaw with my fingers, holding back quite a bit of strength.

The man crumpled to the ground like a robot that had its power turned off.

<b>

"Hah!"

<b>

In the meantime, Kuon smashed the glass jar with a kick enhanced by 'Body Enhancement (Medium)'.

As a result, all twelve people sitting on the sofa slumped down.

<b>

(*Appraisal*)

<b>

―――

<b>

Asahina Aoi, Human, 15 years old

Status: Unconscious

Notes: She has lost consciousness due to the hypnotic state and the confusion of memories stopping the memory siphoning.

<b>

―――

<b>

It seems they are safe. Now, only one man remains.

<b>

<b>

"Ugh...!?"

<b>

Damn, my MP has dropped below the safety margin at this crucial moment.

For now, I’ll have to manage without using skills, just with this body—.

<b>

"Die! You damn monster!"

<b>

When I turned around, there was the other man I had been looking for.

And the muzzle of his gun was definitely aimed at my head.

<b>

"Iori-kun!?"

<b>

Seeing that, Kuon used 'Body Enhancement' and tried to jump between me and the man.

<b>

*Skill level has reached maximum, and the required experience points have been attained. Leveling up will occur.*

<b>

At that moment, a voice I had heard somewhere echoed in my mind.

Impossible. The skill level for 'Body Enhancement' shouldn't reach the maximum of 10 for a while.

Yet it leveled up? This is... 

<b>

(No, I'll think about that later...!)

<b>

The moment the man in the tracksuit fired the bullet, I used 'Body Enhancement (Medium)' to dodge it.

Then, enhancing my leg strength, I slammed the man's body into the hard ground.
