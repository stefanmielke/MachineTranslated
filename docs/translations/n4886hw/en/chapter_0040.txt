# Episode 37: I Made Them Pay the Price 1

"Looks like I just barely made it."

<b>

After confirming the state of the ice surfboard, the black figure buried in the rubble, and Kana and the other students, I let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"Uh, big brother? Why are you here...?"

"Sorry. Just sleep for a little while."

<b>

Using 'Cognitive Disruption Magic' on the confused Kana, I made her recognize that she was in a sleep state, then 'teleported' everyone except me to a hospital secured by the organization Alicia belongs to.

<b>

Now, it’s just me and that guy left.

<b>

"Uooooooh!!"

<b>

As the rubble shattered, a one-eyed monster resembling a marionette emerged, gasping for breath, and let out a loud roar.

Its body was crumbling in places, revealing golden fur like that of a fox through the gaps.

<b>

"You! You not only thwarted my plans, but you also dared to soil my noble divine body!"

<b>

Ignoring the monster's furious ramblings, I re-evaluated it with 'Appraisal.'

<b>

――――

<b>

White-faced Golden-furred Nine-tailed Fox Tail, 500 years old, Yokai

Status: Berserk, Transformation Collapse, Partial Spirit Body Disappearance

Note: Holds intense murderous intent and hatred towards Iori Shu, who interfered with its plans and attacked.

<b>

<b>

――――

<b>

...No doubt about it. This guy is the mastermind behind this series of incidents, the "White-faced Golden-furred Nine-tailed Fox Tail."

<b>

On that day, while fighting Nagamoto, I appraised the thread of light I saw and learned the identity of the one lurking behind this incident.

That thread was a type of yokai technique called 'Puppet Technique,' which allows the user to manipulate a specific target's body to a certain extent.

And that Nine-tailed Fox Tail had been secretly working in this town for the revival of something called 'Hyakki Yagyo.'

Having obtained the flesh of an Ushi-oni, it initially manipulated the elderly Nagamoto with "youth" as bait and the girl named Seina, who had bullied it, with "revenge," creating a multitude of subordinates in this town, and was on the verge of achieving its long-held ambition.

<b>

Having learned this through 'Appraisal' and the information gathered by Alicia, I had Kuon assist me in tracking down nearly all the humans in this town who could sense yokai energy using 'Tracking and Detection Magic' and 'Appraisal' to find its whereabouts.

Thanks to that, I ended up consuming half of my MP, but I didn't care about that.

<b>

"What part of getting beaten up by a mere kid makes you a 'noble divine body'? I don't get it at all."

"You, you, you! That disrespectful attitude deserves a thousand deaths! I will show no mercy! Die regretting the sins you have committed!"

<b>

As it shouted, its body began to bubble, transforming from a human form into a beastly one.

It took on the appearance of a one-eyed monster resembling a sooty golden-furred fox, with large canine teeth and a tail with hardened tips.

That must be its true form.

<b>

Well, even if its appearance changed, what I had to do remained the same.

<b>

"Hehe, first, I'll tear that cheeky mouth of yours apart... huh?"

<b>

Just as it was about to say that, the Nine-tailed Fox Tail's eyes widened in surprise.

Next, it lost its balance and seemed about to fall.

<b>

"Ah, ahhh!? My, my leg is ahhh!!?"

"Don't shout so loudly. It's just one leg that got blown off."

<b>

I spat that out and jumped onto its back with 'Body Enhancement (Medium),' grabbing its neck and slamming it into the ground.

<b>

"You, you bastard!!!"

<b>

The Nine-tailed Fox Tail glared at me with bloodshot eyes and unleashed purple flames from the tip of its tail towards me.

<b>

('Appraisal')

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Demon Fire Magic

Effect: Generates demon flames using magical power or spiritual power.

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Note: The caster is the White-faced Golden-furred Nine-tailed Fox Tail.

It is using its own spiritual power and part of its spirit body as a catalyst.

<b>

―――

<b>

Magic, huh? That should be easy to deal with.

<b>

"Magic Counter."

<b>

In response, I activated the skill 'Magic Counter' and reflected the flames back towards its hind legs.

<b>

"Y-you... ugh!"

"Frost Magic."

<b>

I froze its jaw with Frost Magic and then severed its right hind leg with the ice sword I created.

Then, I jumped off its back and kicked its face with force.

<b>

"Gyah, gah!"

<b>

The Nine-tailed Fox Tail bounced off the ground like a rubber ball and crashed into the wall.

<b>

"Ugh... damn it, if it’s come to this..."

"What’s that supposed to mean?"

"?!"

<b>

I teleported in front of the Nine-tailed Fox Tail, which was muttering something while looking at the hole in the wall, and kicked it back to the center of the classroom.

<b>

"W-wait! Please wait!"

<b>

Next, I was thinking of cutting off that tail. Just as I was considering that, the Nine-tailed Fox Tail spoke to me.

<b>

"I-I understand! I was foolish! I take back my earlier statement! So please, will you sheathe your weapon!?"

<b>

It seems this guy is begging for his life.

<b>

"And? What benefit do I get from doing that?"

"W-well, I shall grant your wishes. I am one of the great Nine Tails, after all!"

"Oh, really..."

<b>

I dispelled the ice sword and approached the Nine-tailed Fox Tail unarmed.

Seeing that, the Nine-tailed Fox Tail greeted me with a grin.

<b>

"Go on, tell me your wish!"

"…Alright, then let me say this."

<b>

Clenching my fist tightly, I fixed my gaze on its wicked face.

<b>

"Let me punch the bastard who hurt my sister!"

"G-guhhh!?"

<b>

I slammed my fist into the top of the Nine-tailed Fox Tail's head, which even felt infuriating.

Its face sank into the floor, and soon it stopped moving altogether.

<b>

"Haah... it's over."

"Understood. I'll head over there with Kyori right away."

<b>

After telling Alicia that over the intercom, I looked down at the unconscious Nine-tailed Fox Tail on the floor.

I really wanted to kill it, but I was told to capture it alive if possible.

<b>

"…Well then, I’ll leave the rest to them."

<b>

I bound it again with Frost Magic and then 'teleported' to the hospital where Kana and the others were.
