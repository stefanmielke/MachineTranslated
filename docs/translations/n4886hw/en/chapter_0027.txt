# Episode 24: I Tried Out an Extra Skill 1

"I'm home!"

<b>

After guiding Alicia to the staff room and returning home, the house was completely dark.

I thought Kana should have been back long ago since her dojo was supposed to be closed today.

Well, she might be out playing somewhere with friends. Thinking that, I turned on the lights in the room.

<b>

"…Welcome back."

<b>

Kana replied in a tired voice while leaning her whole body against the living room sofa.

<b>

"What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?"

"…It's nothing. Just a bit tired from school. I'll make dinner after I rest a bit."

"You can just stay resting. I'll take care of the chores today."

"…Then please."

<b>

It felt a bit wrong to make her do chores when she looked so unwell.

I put on my favorite plain black apron and started preparing dinner.

For now, I tossed the leftover vegetables and sausages from the fridge, along with some consomme and a can of tomatoes, into a pot to make a simple minestrone. Garlic toast would be enough to go with it.

But before that.

<b>

"Seems like it will be ready soon, but can you eat?"

"…Not yet. Just put it in the fridge."

"Got it. Also, I’ll be stepping out for a bit, so please keep an eye on the house."

"…Okay."

<b>

I stuck a note on the pot with the minestrone saying "reheat it," cleaned the bathroom, and then prepared to go out.

Just before leaving the house, I glanced back into the living room, and Kana was still slumped on the sofa.

<b>

"Is there anything you want me to buy?"

"No, don’t worry about it."

<b>

With just that, Kana closed her eyes.

Just to be sure, I placed my hand on her forehead to check her temperature, but it didn’t seem like she had a cold.

I covered Kana with a blanket, and though I wasn’t sure if it would help with her fatigue, I cast a healing spell on her just in case, and then left the house.

<b>

After running full speed for about ten minutes from home, I arrived at the clearing in the mountains where I had met Kuon a month ago and defeated the Ushi-Oni.

<b>

"Sorry. I'm late."

"No, it's fine."

<b>

In the clearing stood Kuon Miyasato, dressed in sportswear.

<b>

"So, about the verification? You wanted my help with that…"

"Yeah, I want to confirm what kind of skill I gained when I defeated the Ushi-Oni."

<b>

As I spoke, I checked my "Status."

<b>

The skill I want to verify this time is the newly added Extra Skill "Skill Lending."

I tried to use "Appraisal" in advance to check its effect, but as expected, the appraisal result was quite vague.

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Extra Skill "Skill Lending"

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Description: Can lend possessed skills to specific individuals.

Note: Cannot gain exp bonus as the skill level has reached its maximum.

<b>

―――

<b>

"Skill Lending," as the name suggests, allows me to "lend" my skills to someone else.

Also, it seems that this skill, or perhaps all Extra Skills, are acquired at maximum skill level from the start.

<b>

Now, as you can tell from the effect of "Skill Lending," it cannot be verified alone.

So, I invited Kuon, who knows about "Skills" and "Status," to join me.

Additionally, this verification has another purpose besides just investigating "Skill Lending" in detail.

<b>

"So, what kind of skill is that?"

"To put it simply, it's a skill that allows you to 'lend skills to someone.'"

"…I see. That's why you called me."

"You're quick to understand, which helps."

<b>

While explaining to Kuon, I began preparing for the verification.

The skills I plan to "lend" her are "Body Enhancement" and "Body Enhancement (Medium)," which I recently acquired.

Both skills can instantly enhance physical abilities, with no differences other than the MP cost and the enhancement rate.

<b>

"…Alright."

<b>

I looked straight at Kuon and reached out my hand.

First, I decided to lend her "Body Enhancement."

<b>

"Skill Lending."

<b>

As I activated the skill, a faint light enveloped Kuon's body for a moment.

<b>

"Do you feel any discomfort in your body?"

"Not particularly… So what do I do next?"

"When I give the signal, concentrate on 'Body Enhancement' in your mind and then jump as high as you can."

"Understood."

<b>

In the meantime, I checked my own status again.

<b>

The MP cost for "Skill Lending" is 20. Considering that "Body Enhancement" costs 5, that's quite hefty.

<b>

"Alright, go ahead."

"…Yes!"

<b>

Kuon closed her eyes and focused, then kicked off the ground powerfully.

Her body soared into the air like a scene from an action movie.

<b>

"Whoa!?"

<b>

She probably didn’t expect to jump this high.

Though she slightly lost her balance, she managed to land safely.

<b>

"Are you okay?"

"Yes! I'm fine!"

"Don't push yourself too hard. And—"

<b>

At that moment, I noticed a change in my "Status."

<b>

<b>

"…Kuon, can you use the skill again just like before?"

<b>

Kuon nodded and activated "Body Enhancement" once more, jumping again.

This time, it seemed she had grasped the feeling, as she landed with good balance.

<b>

However, my interest lay elsewhere.
