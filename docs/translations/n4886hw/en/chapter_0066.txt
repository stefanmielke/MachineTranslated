# Episode 62: I Ended Up Playing the Heel 2

“What? A date?”

<b>

I was momentarily confused by Alicia's words.

Why is the word 'date' coming up here? Did she mix it up with something else? Or is it some kind of euphemism?

Seeing me completely flustered, Alicia chuckled softly.

<b>

“You have the ability to charm others and make them see you as someone else, right?”

<b>

Without any preamble, she began to touch on my ability—“Recognition Disruption Magic.”

<b>

“...Even if I do, how does that connect to a date?”

“I had my subordinates investigate, and it seems they choose people to play the villain based solely on appearances.”

<b>

Well, that’s probably true, considering that student who dyed their hair just for fun during summer vacation was chosen.

...Ah, I’m starting to understand the situation.

<b>

“So basically, you want to use that ability to make 'us look like targets in hero suits'?”

“Correct. It’s nice to have someone who understands quickly.”

“...And then what?”

“After that, I’ll use my subordinates to pretend to be victims and scouts under hypnosis, then ambush the heroes. Afterward, we’ll create a ruckus in the aerial fortress they call the 'Base' while capturing the main hero.”

“Hey, hey, that sounds like a pretty reckless... or rather, a plan that relies on me.”

<b>

Listening to what could barely be called a plan, I sank deeper into the sofa and began to think about what to do.

<b>

There’s certainly a way to do it. But we need one more move, something that could act as a catalyst.

The 'Hero' and the other heroes in suits aren’t rushing to reinforce after that chaotic battle, and there’s no sign they’re planning another attack.

I don’t know if they were flustered by the unexpected situation or if they decided it wasn’t worth the trouble to intervene, but if we’re going to make a move, we’ll need some kind of shake-up.

<b>

“Got it. The general outline of your plan is fine. But there’s one thing I want to change.”

“...Let’s hear it.”

“First—”

<b>

After hearing my explanation, Alicia fell silent and began to think deeply.

Did I go too far? Just as I started to think that, she looked up at me.

<b>

“Yeah, that would definitely provoke a bigger reaction from them. The problem is preparing to execute it, though—”

“Don’t worry about that. I can prepare something to shake them up within a night.”

“Then I’ll leave that to you. I’m really sorry for putting so much burden on you.”

“That’s a bit late to say. Let’s not worry about it.”

<b>

When I said that, she nodded.

<b>

Now, just when I thought there was nothing more to discuss, the alarm on my watch went off.

<b>

Looking out the window, I saw the sunlight and blue sky.

<b>

“Looks like I kept you up all night after all.”

“It’s summer vacation, so I’ll just sleep when I get home. Send me the date and time for the operation via email after evening.”

“Understood.”

<b>

With that, I tried to return home directly using “Spatial Transfer Magic.”

<b>

But before that.

<b>

“Hey, why did you suddenly get so motivated to uncover the truth behind this incident? You were practically unmotivated when you called me out, right?”

<b>

At my question, Alicia's expression clouded for a moment before she replied with an obvious forced smile.

<b>

“I have information I desperately want, and an opportunity has come up to rise within the organization. That’s all there is to it.”

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

Thus, three days after the fierce battle with the hero suit group, I ended up going on a date with Alicia, or rather Alisa, to attract attention...

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Hey, hey! I want that stuffed animal!”

<b>

After finishing our meal at the amusement facility's restaurant and wandering around, Alicia clung to my arm and pointed at a crane game.

<b>

“Okay, I got it. I’ll get it for you.”

<b>

I replied awkwardly and stood in front of the crane game’s control panel.

<b>

(…Hey, Alicia. I’m really bad at these kinds of games.)

(If we’re a couple, this is the standard, right? Just do it without complaining. Plus, the expenses will be covered by the organization!)

<b>

With that said, I reluctantly inserted a 100-yen coin into the crane game and aimed for the stuffed animal Alicia wanted.

<b>

Well, I have over 100 levels of stats, right? I used to be bad at this, but I should be able to clear it easily now.

<b>

...I had underestimated it too much.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“...Can you do it?”

“Don’t worry! Next! It should be in a position where it’s easier to grab next time!”

“I just heard that a few seconds ago…”

“I can really do it!”

<b>

Saying that, I put in another 100-yen coin and pressed the button again.

The arm grabbed the handle of the box containing the stuffed animal and lifted it into the air— 

<b>

“Ah—...”

<b>

It seems the weight was too much, as the box containing the stuffed animal fell from the arm and landed on top of the pile of stuffed animals.

<b>

Seeing that, I reflexively opened my wallet to put in either another 100-yen or a 500-yen coin, but unfortunately, I only had a few 5-yen and 10-yen coins.

<b>

“See!? This kind of thing happens too! Next time, let’s go to a place you want—”

“...No, I can’t let this one slip away.”

<b>

I was well aware that I was being stubborn. Even so, giving up after throwing away this much money was something my pride wouldn’t allow.

More than anything, I was convinced that I was just one push away from getting it... even if I had no basis for that.

<b>

“I’ll go exchange some coins.”

“Go ahead, do as you like.”

<b>

Not wanting to see Alicia’s probably very exasperated face, I headed to the change machine.

Fortunately, I still had plenty of my part-time job earnings from Kuon, and I heard that the organization would cover the expenses used on this date.

<b>

“...Alright.”

<b>

After exchanging a 1000-yen bill from my wallet and finishing my errand, I headed back to the machine for another attempt.

<b>

“Hey, miss. Want to play with us?”

“Sorry. I’m waiting for a friend—”

“Just send a message and ignore them. It’s way more fun to hang out with us.”

“Um…”

<b>

When I returned to the crane game, Alicia was surrounded by a few guys who looked like delinquents.

<b>

(According to the information from 'Appraisal,' these guys are real delinquents.)

<b>

Alicia was struggling with how to respond, while the delinquents persistently tried to hit on her.

<b>

“Sorry, guys. She’s my friend. It’d be a problem if you took her away without permission.”

“What the hell do you want?”

<b>

I grabbed the arm of one delinquent who was trying to grab Alicia's shoulder.

<b>

“Hey, get your filthy arm off her! Or else—”

“—Or else what?”

<b>

To suppress the pressure that comes with my status, I loosened the 'Recognition Disruption Magic' I usually activate and looked at the delinquents with a forced smile.

<b>

“W-What!?”

<b>

The delinquents turned pale with fear and fled the scene in a hurry.

<b>

“Skill acquisition conditions have been met. The skill 'Pressure' has been added to your skill list.”

<b>

At that moment, the mechanical voice I hadn’t heard in a while echoed in my mind.

I had expected this since the extra skill was added, but it seems new skills can be added as well.

<b>

But that’s a thought for later.

I reactivated the 'Recognition Disruption Magic' and spoke to Alicia.

<b>

“Sorry for causing trouble.”

“N-No, it’s fine.”

<b>

Alicia said that, but her tone was somewhat off.

This wasn’t just because she was harassed by delinquents; it was likely because I had momentarily released part of the 'Recognition Disruption Magic.'

<b>

“What should we do? I think the timing is just about right.”

“...Yeah. Let’s step outside and check.”

<b>

After checking my watch, we exited the amusement facility.

I thought it had ended on a rather unpleasant note when suddenly—

<b>

“!?”

“What is this...!?”

<b>

A sudden, intense headache hit us, accompanied by a flood of commands and thoughts in my mind.

<b>

“Threaten the middle school girl in the alley behind the building three blocks away,” a strangely specific instruction, along with the thought that “there’s nothing wrong with threatening someone for money.”

<b>

It seems the first phase of the operation was successful.

Confirming that, I targeted both myself and Alicia and activated 'Dispel' to break the brainwashing.

<b>

“Phew... it seems the enemy took the bait.”

“Looks like it. Our setup to keep them focused on us all day paid off.”

<b>

Shaking off the brainwashing, we began to walk toward the instructed location.

<b>

Now, the second phase of the operation begins.
