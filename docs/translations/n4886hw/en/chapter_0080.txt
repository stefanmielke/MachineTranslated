# Chapter 76: Invited to the Mansion 4

"Ah... ahhh..."

"I apologize. It seems that Sougen-sama is not feeling well today."

"I-I understand..."

<b>

As I answered in confusion, the shikigami bowed and took Sougen away through the sliding door on the opposite side.

Huh? Is this really the end?

I couldn't even have a proper conversation, let alone ask questions...

<b>

While I was in such confusion, the large hall became empty, leaving only me.

<b>

(Haa, what a complete waste of effort.)

<b>

Disheartened by the terrible outcome, I tried to get my false body to stand up, and then I had a certain doubt.

<b>

<b>

According to the appraisal results, it seems that Kuon Sougen was poisoned not just yesterday or today.

If that's the case, was it really Kuon Sougen who called me here?

No, more importantly, did that letter really come from him...?

<b>

(...Oh?)

<b>

At that moment, I heard a rustling sound coming from somewhere.

When I turned my gaze toward the sound, the sliding door that the shikigami and Kuon Sougen had entered was rattling.

<b>

...Did that shikigami forget something in this room, or did they have another appointment?

In any case, there was nothing for me to do here, so I should just leave quickly.

I was thinking that when...

<b>

"...Hey, they definitely entered this room, right?"

"...No doubt about it. The shikigami that guides him is right there."

"...Alright, we'll make sure to take him down here for Genji-sama."

<b>

Now, I could hear multiple footsteps and voices coming from the sliding door I had entered.

Moreover, from the faintly audible conversation, it seemed that their target was me, or more precisely, my life.

<b>

What should I do? If I use spatial transfer, it would definitely cause a commotion, and on the other hand, I don't want to overuse recognition inhibition due to the nature of this false body.

<b>

"...This way, this way."

<b>

As I was thinking that, I heard a somewhat flustered young woman's voice from the back sliding door.

Looking over, I saw a hand reaching out from the gap in the door, beckoning me to come over.

<b>

It felt like a trap, but considering the murderous intent from the group approaching from the other side, I had no choice.

<b>

(And since it's a false body, I shouldn't take any damage myself.)

<b>

Having decided on my course of action, I set up a spare drone in the large hall just in case and directed the false body toward the back sliding door.

Then, the door opened just enough for one person to enter, and a dim corridor was illuminated by the sunlight streaming in from the room.

<b>

(They probably want me to go in here, but... whoa!?)

<b>

The moment I placed my false body's hand on the edge of the door to peek inside, someone inside grabbed my arm and forcibly pulled me into the dim corridor.

As the false body was completely dragged into the space beyond the gap, the door was slammed shut with force.

<b>

(That was quite rough... So, where is this--)

<b>

What lay beyond the door was a space resembling a maze, with countless stairs extending in all directions, like something out of a Japanese horror movie or game.

<b>

It seemed that this corridor, like other parts of the mansion, had its space distorted, making the interior clearly larger than the exterior.

Moreover, the troublesome part was that there were no lighting fixtures in this corridor, and the only light source was a faint beam coming from a door at the end of the stairs. It seemed impossible to walk properly in such darkness.

<b>

Fortunately, "Sensory Sharing" was functioning. If it came to it, I could escape with just the false body using "Spatial Transfer Magic." Luckily, it seemed there was no risk of being seen here.

<b>

(Huh? Did someone just touch me...?)

<b>

While I was thinking about that, the hem of my clothes (which were recreated with water magic) was being tugged by someone.

When I turned around, there stood a small girl with medium-length hair, likely around the same age as Kana, dressed in light clothing.

<b>

"Come on, let's hurry up. If we stay here, they'll notice us."

"W-Wait a minute. Where is this? And who are you?"

<b>

When I asked, she sighed as if exasperated.

<b>

"...There's no time. Can you ask questions while we walk?"

"Y-Yeah, got it."

<b>

As I replied in confusion, she walked ahead with a haughty attitude.

I struggled to maneuver the false body in the unfamiliar terrain, but I managed to get closer to the girl and spoke to her again.

<b>

"Thanks for saving me earlier. What's your name?"

"Koharu, Kuon Koharu."

<b>

So this girl was also a member of the Kuon family. I had suspected as much since she seemed quite familiar with the mansion's structure.

<b>

"Koharu, huh... Why did you help me?"

"Because you're a friend of Onee-sama Kyori. That's the only reason."

<b>

Hmm, she's a bit harsh. I don't mind that, but...

Did she just refer to Kyori as Onee-sama?

<b>

"Um, so you're Kuon's younger sister, then?"

"...No. I'm just calling her that on my own. Onee-sama Kyori and I are just relatives."

"Then why do you call Kuon Onee-sama?"

"That's because... I admire Onee-sama..."

<b>

I knew there were many people at my school who admired Kuon, so that in itself wasn't surprising.

However, the fact that she went out of her way to call her Onee-sama likely indicated that her admiration was quite strong.

<b>

"Admiration, huh? Specifically, what do you admire about her?"

<b>

When I casually asked that, Koharu suddenly stopped.

As I observed her, wondering what was wrong, she suddenly spread her arms wide.

<b>

"Of course, everything about Onee-sama!"

"...Everything?"

"Onee-sama is the kindest person in the world! She's hardworking! Strong! Cute! Beautiful! The best, the strongest, and the most perfect person! It's strange not to admire such an Onee-sama, right?!"

"W-Whoa, okay, I get it. Just calm down for now...!"

<b>

While I was bewildered by her sudden change in attitude, I activated "Appraisal" on Koharu to check if she was under any kind of chaotic spell.

<b>

――――

<b>

Kuon Koharu, Human, 13 years old

Condition: Healthy

Notes: She is eager to be alone with Kuon Kyori. She also feels anger towards the Kuon family.

<b>

――――

<b>

Ah... so she's just a girl with overwhelming love for Kuon.

I could tell she didn't harbor any ill intentions, but it seemed better to change the subject forcibly.

<b>

"By the way, what kind of place is this? There are clearly things that seem to defy the laws of physics here."

"Eh? Ah, this is like a shortcut created by applying barrier techniques. There are doors everywhere, right? By passing through those, you can move to any part of the mansion."

<b>

So it's similar to the space where Kuon and I were trapped during the camp's haunted house.

<b>

Oh, right. I forgot to ask the most important thing.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, this is a bit late to ask, but where are we going now--"

"...?"

<b>

Just as I was about to finish my sentence, the false body's eyes caught sight of something human-shaped moving at high speed in the darkness.

It used the stairs as a foothold to accelerate further and instantly moved right above us, throwing a short blade it held with great force toward Koharu.

<b>

"What are you doing? Why are you suddenly silent...?"

"Watch out, it's dangerous!"

<b>

I quickly maneuvered the false body to shield her with a covering posture.

By a hair's breadth, the thrown dagger did not injure Koharu and stopped against the back of the false body.

<b>

"W-What...? You...?"

"Don't worry about it. More importantly..."

<b>

After managing to move the false body, which had its sensitivity to "Sensory Sharing" significantly reduced due to the previous attack, I looked around to identify the assailant and caught sight of it clinging to the ceiling.

<b>

<b>

---What was there was a grotesque monster.

It had a face resembling the small demon I fought before, arms that were disproportionately long for its body, filthy green skin, bloodshot eyes, long ears, and a body with noise-like distortions.

<b>

"Gi-sha-sha-sha-sha!"

<b>

The unidentified monster clinging to the ceiling let out an unpleasant laugh as it looked down at us, as if judging us.
