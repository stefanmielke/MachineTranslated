# Episode 6: Three Months Have Passed

"Make sure to submit your course preference survey by tomorrow. That’s it for homeroom. Attention!"

"「「「Thank you very much!」」」"

<b>

I bow towards the computer screen and let out a sigh of relief as I close the window.

Three months after that incident, I was transferred to a different class.

That said, I haven't met my new classmates even once.

<b>

As you know, the school building has collapsed to such an extent that it is no longer possible to attend classes as usual.

However, it is not feasible to transfer students to another school either.

Therefore, the school decided to resume classes online.

Thanks to that, I have been able to lead a peaceful school life without being subjected to various inquiries from other students, and my personal research has been progressing smoothly.

<b>

Since then, I have been steadily using my skills to level up every day. As a result, this month, I finally reached level 30.

Wow, it really has been quite a struggle to get here.

The ice magic I casually acquired because it was hot went out of control, and when I tried to test the healing magic, my sister misunderstood it in a strange way...

Now, looking back, they have become good memories, or rather, memories I can laugh off without a care.

<b>

"…I guess it's about time I should acquire a new skill."

<b>

As can be seen from my status, I have an abundance of skill points.

After all, in these three months, the only new skills I have acquired are "Ice Magic" and "Healing Magic."

Moreover, I learned these two in a half-crazed state due to the summer heat. If the season had been different, I might not have acquired any skills at all.

<b>

I generally tend to hesitate to use items when playing games.

This has not changed in this reality, which has become like a game, and I find myself reluctant to use skill points.

Isn't this what they call "Elixir Syndrome"?

<b>

However, among the skills I currently possess, the only ones that haven't reached their maximum level are the rarely tested Space Transfer Magic and Healing Magic.

It would be better to acquire a skill that I can use more casually soon.

<b>

"…But I have no idea what each skill does."

<b>

Like last time, I start to ponder again in front of the vast array of skills displayed after tapping the SP section.

<b>

What if I waste my precious skill points on a useless skill based on a whim? That anxiety just won't leave my mind.

<b>

"Ping"

<b>

As I gaze at the skill list, a notification sound comes from my smartphone.

<b>

"Rice and toilet paper are about to run out, so please go buy some."

<b>

It was a message from my sister, who attends a kendo dojo.

<b>

Since we are a single-parent household and my father comes home late, household chores like cooking dinner, cleaning, and laundry are basically alternated between my sister and me every day. Well, the order changes depending on our circumstances.

Shopping is also part of the chores. So, since it’s my turn today, I have to go.

<b>

"Shopping, huh..."

<b>

Three months ago, I thought I would easily handle household chores with skills, but unfortunately, it seems that hasn't worked out so conveniently.

For example, with Space Transfer Magic. After various tests and trial and error, I have managed to transfer my body to another location, but the MP consumption has become quite significant.

I still have some leeway for transfers within a few meters, but if I try to teleport to the nearest supermarket, my MP runs out.

<b>

"I wish there was something... a skill that makes chores easier."

<b>

As I casually swipe through the skill list, one skill catches my eye.

<b>

"…'Item Box'?"

<b>

"Item Box" is a skill often seen in games and online novels.

If this has the same effect as in those creations...

<b>

"…Alright."

<b>

If I don't go with the flow of the situation, I won't be able to increase my skills anytime soon.

So, I tapped on the "Item Box" section, which costs 60 SP.

Then, I performed the customary "Appraisal" after acquiring the skill.

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Skill "Item Box"

Effect: Summons an item box using MP

Status: Skill Level 1/10

Supplement:

<b>

―――

<b>

Hmm, as expected, I can't really understand the effect just from the information from "Appraisal."

In the end, I won't know the details until I actually use it and verify it.

<b>

"Item Box!"

<b>

Having confirmed the effect, I promptly activate the skill "Item Box."

Then, a white box-like object appeared before me.

<b>

"Is this it?"

<b>

Feeling somewhat anxious, I observe the white box, and the pencil I was holding in my left hand gets sucked into it.

<b>

"Wha, huh?"

<b>

As I was taken aback by the sudden event, a transparent panel similar to "Status" appeared from the white box.

<b>

―――

<b>

"Item Box"

List of Stored Items

- 1 Pencil

<b>

―――

<b>

"…'Item Box' Release."

<b>

I casually deactivate the skill, and this time the white box disappears, and the pencil falls from the air.

Next, I check my "Status."
