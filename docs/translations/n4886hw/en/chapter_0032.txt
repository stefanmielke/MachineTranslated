# Episode 29: I Decided to Investigate 2

“...Alright”

<b>

<b>

After returning home, I immediately opened my 'Status' and checked the 'Skill List' instead of peeking at that group chat.

<b>

I know that there is a hypnosis effect cast on that chat.

If that's the case, I should prepare some countermeasures while I still can.

<b>

“Now, which one is the winner...”

<b>

The number of displayed skills is enormous, and their effects won't be known until I actually acquire them.

That said, I currently have plenty of skill points.

So, I’ll trust my instincts and acquire what I think is “the one.”

<b>

“Oh, this one looks good.”

<b>

What caught my eye was a skill called 'Dispel.'

When I looked up that term on my smartphone, it seems to be commonly used in games for effects that nullify curses or magic.

I don't know if the meaning of 'Dispel' in this other world is the same as in the games from this world, but if it's different, I can think about that later.

Next... I might as well acquire this 'Magic Counter' just in case.

<b>

With that light-hearted feeling, I tapped on 'Skill Acquisition.'

<b>

“'Appraisal'”

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Dispel

Effect: Nullifies activated or ongoing magic or abilities.

Status: Skill Level 1/10

Supplement:

―――

<b>

Fortunately, the appraisal result for 'Dispel' was exactly what I had hoped for. Well, there is still a possibility that it could be disappointing once I actually use it.

However.

<b>

“This one doesn’t seem useful...”

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Magic Counter

Effect: Can reflect magic cast by the opponent to a target of choice.

Status: Skill Level 1/10

Supplement:

<b>

―――

<b>

I took this one just to try it out, but I probably won't use it this time.

Now, first, I need to confirm what this 'Dispel' actually is.

<b>

First, I used 'Water Magic' to create a small water droplet in my palm and activated 'Dispel' against it.

Then the water droplet vanished as if it had never existed.

<b>

Next, I checked my status to see how much MP I had consumed.

<b>

―――

<b>

I had consumed 10 MP for 'Appraisal' and 5 for 'Water Magic,' so the required MP for 'Dispel' is about 20.

Next is...

<b>

“...Hmph”

<b>

This time, I used about 50 MP to create a giant water droplet and activated 'Dispel' against it.

My 'Dispel' skill level is still just 1. It’s possible that I can't nullify larger-scale magic.

That was the purpose of this test.

<b>

“...It disappeared.”

<b>

The giant water droplet dissipated just as easily as before.

This means that 'Dispel' can nullify any magic or ability at skill level 1.

So, what can I do by raising the skill level?

<b>

“...I should check this one too.”

<b>

Next, I generated a small ice ball using Ice Magic and floated it with a small tornado created by Wind Magic.

<b>

“'Dispel'”

<b>

Then, when I activated 'Dispel,' only the ice ball vanished, leaving the tornado behind.

<b>

“...”

<b>

I activated the skill again in the same way, focusing my awareness on the tornado while activating 'Dispel.'

This time, only the tornado vanished, and the ice ball fell to the floor.

<b>

I see, at my current skill level, I can only nullify one thing at a time.

<b>

Well, I can manage with this.

<b>

Thinking that, I opened the messaging app on my smartphone and hesitantly tapped on the rumored group chat.

And the moment my finger touched the screen, something like a purple magic circle appeared, and a sweet-smelling smoke began to pour out from it.

<b>

“'Dispel'”

<b>

Seeing that, I activated the 'Dispel' skill, and the smoke vanished instantly, with the magic circle itself turning colorless.

For now, I want to believe that I managed to avoid the trap of 'Hypnosis Magic.'

Now, next is about this magic circle.

<b>

“'Appraisal'”

<b>

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Hypnosis Magic

Effect: Automatically convinces those who view the chat that they are dating a random opposite sex person who is also viewing the chat, and prompts them to head to the location where items with the 'Automatic Collection' and 'Memory Recall' magic circles are set up.

Status: Skill Level 6/10

Supplement: The activator is Shinsuke Nagamoto, chairman of the designated organized crime group "Sanfudo-kai."

A part of the remains of a Ushi-Oni was used as the magic catalyst.

<b>

―――

<b>

...Sanfudo-kai, that should be the organized crime group that the yakuza from yesterday belonged to.

And looking at this appraisal result, it seems there are multiple items similar to that glass bottle.

<b>

“Purururu”

<b>

While I was making such deductions, I received a call from Kuon.

<b>

“Hello?”

“Sorry for the sudden call, this is Kuon. I wanted to talk a bit about yesterday... Is now a good time?”

“Yeah, it’s fine. So, what do you want to talk about?”

“...Well, I was thinking of investigating what happened yesterday. Would you be able to cooperate with me?”

<b>

What a remarkable timing for a call, I thought as I opened my mouth.

<b>

<b>

“Sure. Though I’ve already mostly finished my investigation.”

<b>

“Ha... Huh!?”
