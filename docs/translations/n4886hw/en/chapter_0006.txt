# Episode 5: Skill Testing Has Begun 2

“...Alright”

<b>

After having a simple breakfast of cereal and banana, I returned to my room and started testing various 'magic' skills.

<b>

The first thing I realized was that the scale of skills with 'magic' in their name greatly changes depending on the caster's imagination.

When I first tried the 'Water Magic' skill in the bathroom, I probably unconsciously put a limit on it, not wanting to get soaked. As a result, the water sphere that appeared was the size of my palm.

Then, when I activated 'Water Magic' again, I was imagining something more extravagant, so a water sphere almost the same size as my height appeared.

<b>

Considering the above, it can be predicted that the effects of magic skills greatly change based on the caster's imagination.

<b>

And this is the most important point: the MP consumed by magic skills is not constant.

In the previous example, the MP consumed to create the palm-sized water sphere was 5, but when I created the extra-large water sphere, it consumed 50 MP all at once.

<b>

Taking these into account, the method I came up with to consistently gain the experience points needed for leveling up is this.

<b>

“'Water Magic'”

<b>

When I activate the skill, a small water sphere, small enough to be called a marble, appears on my palm.

After confirming that, I open my status while paying attention to ensure the water sphere doesn’t disappear.

“First stage cleared, then.”

<b>

The problem is what comes next.

I dispel the water sphere and activate 'Water Magic' again.

Imagining a very small water sphere the size of the one I just created.

<b>

“... 'Water Magic'”

<b>

Once again, a water sphere that looks the same size as the previous one appears on my palm.

Now, the important part comes next.

<b>

“'Status'”

<b>

“Phew...”

<b>

Seeing the consumed MP value, I let out a sigh of relief.

By minimizing the size of the water sphere to the smallest possible, I reduced the MP consumption to the minimum value of 1, maximizing the number of times I can use the skill.

This is my method for consistently gaining experience points.

<b>

However, it was a struggle to reach this point.

If I held even a slightly inflated image, the shape of the water sphere would become unstable and the MP consumption would increase, while on the contrary, if the image was too vague, the skill itself would not activate.

Because of this, adjusting was quite difficult.

<b>

In any case, all I have to do now is to activate the skill every day while ensuring a safety margin without forgetting this sensation and continue to gain experience points.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“You have reached the required experience points. Leveling up will occur.”

<b>

While I was thinking about this, a sudden mechanical voice echoed.

At the same time, the numbers on the displayed status began to change.

<b>

Oh, so this is a live level up.

Until now, I had leveled up automatically while sleeping, so I had never seen it directly.

<b>

As I was immersed in such thoughts, a sudden idea crossed my mind.

<b>

The results of the physical measurements I took right after transferring schools were almost the same as the national average.

If I assume that to be the physical ability of level 1, I wonder how much my physical ability has increased now that I’ve reached level 14.

<b>

“...Hey, big brother, are you free right now?”

<b>

After a light knock on the door, I hear my sister's voice.

I hurriedly close the status and replied, “Yeah, I’m good.”

<b>

“...About this morning...”

“Oh, you mean the shower?”

“No, not that...”

“? Was there anything other than the shower?”

“...If you don’t remember, that’s fine. Also, I’m going to buy ingredients for lunch and dinner, so come with me.”

“Got it. I’ll get ready right away.”

<b>

After conveying that, my sister left the room.

I would do the status verification later, but for now, I’ll just focus on repaying the debt of the trouble I caused for two weeks.

<b>

Switching my thoughts, I began to change my clothes.
