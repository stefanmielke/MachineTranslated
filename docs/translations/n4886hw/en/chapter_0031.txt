# Chapter 28: I Decided to Investigate 1

"Your skin is beautiful! How do you take care of it?"

"Well, I always—"

<b>

During lunch break, the center of attention in the classroom was Alicia and Kuon.

Alicia, with a dazzling smile, was closing in on Kuon, who, while a bit flustered, responded with a friendly and gentle smile.

<b>

"An angel and an idol, nice..."

"Which one do you prefer?"

"I think I like Alicia-san. That bright personality is the best."

"I prefer Kuon-san. That modest smile is just great."

<b>

<b>

Watching them, some classmates were debating who was more wonderful, Kuon or Alicia.

In just half a day, Alicia had gained popularity equal to Kuon's.

Well, considering her exotic looks and sociable personality, it’s somewhat of a natural result.

<b>

Comparing the bright and cheerful Alicia to an idol and the always gentle and friendly Kuon to an angel was quite clever.

As I thought about this while eating lunch and checking my smartphone.

<b>

"Shu, which one do you prefer?"

"Huh?"

"Don't 'huh' me. Who do you think is better, Kuon-san or Alicia-san?"

<b>

Suddenly being addressed by a male friend made me let out a strange sound.

At that moment, I felt like Kuon, who was chatting with Alicia, briefly glanced this way, but it was probably just my imagination.

<b>

"Isn't it okay to say 'everyone is different and everyone is good'?"

"That's a boring answer."

"Don't expect that kind of sense from me. Ask Rentaro about this kind of thing."

"But I heard he's taking a break from school for a while. I wonder what happened."

<b>

When one of my friends brought up that topic, everyone fell silent.

<b>

"Sorry, I didn't read the room."

"No, it's fine. You don't have to worry about it."

"Anyway, it's probably just Rentaro being an idiot and getting hurt, and now he's at home playing games or something."

<b>

I said that to support my friend, but everyone's faces remained gloomy.

And our gazes naturally turned to Rentaro's empty seat.

<b>

"…and Asama Rentaro will be taking a break from school for a while."

<b>

At the end of homeroom, Ms. Koshimizu told us this with a regretful expression.

The sudden leave of absence of a classmate was shocking enough, but when it involved multiple people at once, it was even more bewildering.

Perhaps everyone getting caught up in the "Alicia or Kuon" debate was a form of escapism from this sudden situation.

<b>

But I couldn’t shift my focus like they did.

<b>

That’s because last night, I witnessed Rentaro's girlfriend having her "memories" sucked out with a vacant expression in that building.

My mental state wasn’t strong enough to carry on with daily life as if nothing had happened after seeing something like that.

Thinking that, I had been researching last night's incident online whenever I had free time since morning.

However, the information I found was all similar and nothing new.

<b>

In that case, it seems I have no choice but to investigate diligently.

I called out to the male friend who had asked me about "which is better, Kuon or Alicia."

<b>

"Hey, do you know how Rentaro and his girlfriend met?"

"Oh, he said they met through a chat or something."

"Chat?"

"Yeah, he was recommended to a group chat called 'You Will Definitely Get a Boyfriend or Girlfriend.' I was too scared to open it, though."

<b>

A group chat that guarantees you’ll get a boyfriend or girlfriend, huh.

Come to think of it, all the students who are taking a break now were those who boasted about getting a girlfriend.

And that glass bottle was said to be for "sucking out happy memories," and more importantly, Rentaro's girlfriend was described as being in a hypnotic state due to magic cast within the group chat.

<b>

…Could it be?

<b>

"Hey, can you send me the link to that group chat?"

"That's fine, but you’re not seriously believing that, are you?"

"Not exactly. It's just…"

<b>

When I looked again at Rentaro's empty seat, my male friend seemed to understand my intent and sighed.

<b>

"Got it. Just don’t do anything dangerous. If you end up taking a break too, I really won’t be able to handle it."

"Yeah, I swear I won’t do anything that would get me suspended."

<b>

After saying that vaguely, my friend sent me the link to the rumored group chat on my messaging app.

<b>

"I'll say it again, don’t do anything dangerous, okay?"

"I understand. I won’t do anything reckless."

<b>

Now, whether this will lead me to the truth of the incident is uncertain, but I’ll give it a shot.

<b>

With that in mind, I gulped down the rest of my lunch.
