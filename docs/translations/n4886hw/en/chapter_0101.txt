# Episode 97: A Challenge Overcome 7

“P-please, come in.”

“I’m sorry to intrude…”

<b>

Kyori’s room, since the time I was carried in after collapsing from the cow demon extermination, remained as clean and simple as ever.

I followed Kyori’s lead and headed to the living room, taking a seat near the glass table placed in the center.

<b>

—If you have time, could we meet after school today? There’s something I really want to tell you.

<b>

I received her message on my smartphone’s chat app this morning while preparing to head to school.

There’s no curfew at my house, and today’s house chores are not my responsibility but Kana’s. I have a promise to report to Alicia at 5 PM, but that should take less than an hour.

Thinking that, I sent a message saying, “If it’s okay after 6 PM,” and Kyori immediately replied, “That’s fine.”

So, for this reason, Kyori and I decided to meet.

<b>

“I’m sorry. This is all I could prepare right now.”

<b>

Kyori came in a bit late, holding two bottles of mineral water, and offered one to me.

<b>

“No, no, you don’t have to go that far.”

“...I’m relieved to hear you say that.”

<b>

Saying this with a smile, I unscrewed the cap of the bottle.

Still… 

<b>

“Are you okay? You seem a bit nervous.”

“Eh!? D-do I look that way…?”

“Yeah, kinda. Just a feeling.”

“Uh, um, please don’t worry about me…!”

“…”

<b>

I took a sip from the bottle while observing Kyori again.

She seems restless. She wasn’t like this at school, so something must have happened before coming or after school. Or maybe she’s just not feeling well. She’s been working hard these past few days.

<b>

“Should we reschedule for another day? You don’t seem quite yourself.”

“No! Please, let’s do it today!”

“O-okay. I understand.”

<b>

I was pushed into it more than I expected.

What could be so important that she wants to tell me this badly…?

<b>

“Um, first of all, thank you for all your help!”

“You don’t need to thank me; I was the one who barged in. By the way, since you came to school today, does that mean we’ll see each other at school from now on?”

<b>

From Kyori’s perspective, she has no other connection with me and Alicia besides sitting close together and being in the same group during the school camp. Plus, Alicia has strictly told her not to reveal her identity, so I try to steer the conversation carefully.

<b>

“Yes! Thanks to the arrangements made by a new representative from the Kuon family, I’ll be able to continue attending school!”

<b>

Kyori seems genuinely happy to be able to go to school again.

<b>

“That’s great to hear. The folks in our class were worried you might drop out.”

“I heard that from Kana-chan too. Everyone was really worried!”

<b>

Kana… oh, you mean Ueshima-san.

So Kyori is on a first-name basis with Ueshima-san.

<b>

“By the way, I saw you went home with Ueshima-san. Did you go somewhere to play?”

“I was invited, but we talked and decided to hang out again this weekend, and then I met Iori-kun afterward.”

“Wait? So you just got back?”

“Um, yes.”

<b>

Ah, I didn’t notice because she usually uses “space transfer magic” to literally teleport, but our school and the apartment where Kyori lives are quite far apart.

If she was talking with Ueshima-san on the way back, it makes sense that she would arrive around this time.

However, to want to tell me something so badly that she turned down an invitation from her best friend after a long time… What could it be? I can’t believe it’s just to say thank you…

<b>

(I might have to consider using “appraisal” as a last resort.)

<b>

After a silent moment, when the water in my bottle had dipped below half, Kyori seemed to gather her resolve and began to speak.

<b>

“...I know this is a bit late, but please let me apologize. The reason I called you today is really selfish and personal. I’m sorry.”

“I said earlier, you don’t need to worry about me. I’ve called you for selfish and personal reasons too. So, what’s the reason?”

“...Do you remember when you faced the ghost during the school camp?”

“Of course, I remember.”

<b>

Even though it’s only been about two months, it feels nostalgic.

Fighting bears, being trapped in a barrier, battling suspicious merchants, and as Kyori said, facing a ghost warrior…

Huh? Now that I think about it, I don’t have many good memories from that time.

<b>

“At that time, you didn’t just defeat the enemy; you saved the souls of that ghost warrior and the princess out of pure goodwill. For someone like me, raised in the Kuon family where strength is everything, that was very refreshing…”

<b>

Kyori took a deep breath there, looked straight at my face, and began to speak again.

<b>

“You always help those in need with a smile. You extend a gentle hand to those who are sad or suffering. I admire your kindness and strength, and that’s why…”

<b>

It was clear from her expression that Kyori’s words were not flattery.

She looked anxious and helpless, yet she mustered the courage to speak, and that was evident in her face.

<b>

So I listened seriously to her words, Kyori’s words.

<b>

“When you found me crying in the darkness and spoke to me kindly with a smile, I finally understood the true nature of the feelings I have for you.”

<b>

Kyori, trembling with tension and anxiety, desperately squeezed out her voice.

<b>

“I like you, Iori-kun…! Will you go out with me…?”

<b>

I could have predicted this. But when it was actually said, my thought process went haywire.

Does someone like me really have feelings for someone?

Is this some kind of prank? Or did I somehow use “recognition inhibition magic” to make Kyori think she likes me?

I twisted my thoughts in various ways, but when I saw Kyori’s serious expression, flushed with embarrassment, I realized my worries were unfounded at that moment―――.

<b>

(―――!?)

<b>

My heart raced.

A girl so cute, lovable, and earnest said she likes me.

I was genuinely, truly overjoyed. Is this what it means to like someone?

But at the same time, a sense of guilt cast a shadow over my heart.

<b>

“...My power, the reason I could act so confidently, is all thanks to this cheat-like ability. The real me isn’t someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with someone as admirable as you. I’m a coward, a cheat, and I can’t do anything without relying on my own power. I’m that kind of person. So surely, someone more deserving than me is out there—”

“But Iori-kun used that power not for yourself, but for someone else! You helped me! That’s why I fell in love with you!”

<b>

That was a warning, no, just an excuse. Regardless, even after hearing such cowardly words, Kyori told me she liked me. She honestly confessed her feelings.

<b>

Then I must respond to that.

<b>

“To me, Kyori, you are earnest, dutiful, brave, and adorable… I thought I shouldn’t touch someone like you, who obtained power through such underhanded means, and I was afraid to step forward. So I was trying to be satisfied with a business-like relationship where we just borrowed each other’s power.”

<b>

I have faced many rogues and fought many fearsome monsters.

But I don’t think I’ve ever mustered as much courage as I do in this moment.

<b>

“But that ends today. I won’t lie to my feelings anymore. I promise to become someone who can stand tall beside you without relying on my abilities. So—”

<b>

I stood up and bowed my head to Kyori, extending my trembling hand.

<b>

“Please, Kyori Kuon, go out with me…!”

“...Yes! I look forward to it!”

<b>

Kyori showed a moment of surprise but quickly smiled warmly and gently enveloped my outstretched hand with both of hers.

<b>

“...!”

<b>

I gently pulled Kyori into my embrace.

She didn’t resist; instead, she buried her face in my chest.

I wrapped my arms around her back, holding her tightly so she wouldn’t go anywhere.

<b>

“Let’s create so many fun memories that we can make up for lost time, Kyori.”

“...Yes! I’m looking forward to it!”

<b>

We forgot everything, time included, as we embraced each other, savoring each other’s warmth.

<b>

Thus, on that day, the relationship between Kyori and me evolved into something special—being lovers.
