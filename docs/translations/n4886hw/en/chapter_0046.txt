# Episode 42: The Forest School Has Begun 3

The story goes back to when I was still a middle school student.

<b>

<b>

Until now, I had thought of my "Water Magic" skill as merely the ability to generate water at the cost of magic power, or rather MP, and to manipulate it to some extent.

However, even if we simply say "water," there are various types such as scalding hot water that burns upon contact, cold water that can cause frostbite, saltwater, freshwater, water of different colors, and even hard water versus soft water.

Until then, I had unconsciously equated water with pure water and activated "Water Magic," but perhaps I could intentionally generate water other than that.

<b>

With that thought in mind, I conducted experiments with "Water Magic" day and night in the bathroom.

After about a month, I finally succeeded in generating various types of water, including hot and cold water.

<b>

At first, I was overjoyed with the result, but as time passed and my thoughts became calmer, I began to wonder.

<b>

Is there any practical value in this?

<b>

First of all, generating water other than pure water requires more MP than usual.

<b>

Moreover, when activating "Water Magic," I need to think about "what kind of water it is," which adds unnecessary steps compared to activating it without thinking.

<b>

And above all, the uses are limited.

While hot water might be useful for camping or during disasters, I honestly don't know how to use the others.

<b>

Even though I started this out of half interest, I felt disheartened by the lack of practical value and decided to stop the experiments with "Water Magic."

<b>

Thus, I had lost my motivation for the application and development of "Water Magic," but...

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

Just to be safe, I spread a blue sheet in the center of the room and generated a gray water sphere with "Water Magic."

Then, I sent MP into that water sphere while strongly envisioning it, changing its shape into that of a cat.

<b>

"Fuu..."

<b>

For now, the basics are complete.

Next, I need to raise the water temperature and create small waves on the surface to replicate the feel of a cat's fur as closely as possible.

<b>

"...Alright."

<b>

I reached out to the completed cat-like water sphere.

It felt slightly warm, and despite being directly touched, it remained intact in my arms.

<b>

"Nyah~"

<b>

The cat generated by "Water Magic" let out a cat-like meow by utilizing the flow of water inside and stretched its front paws toward my face.

<b>

"...Phew, I can finally generate it within five minutes."

<b>

Satisfied with the level of completion and the time it took to generate, I released "Water Magic."

Then, the cat vanished from my arms as if it had never existed.

<b>

Generating solid objects from fluid water.

<b>

The idea originated from the one-eyed mannequin-like monster that had transformed from the nine-tailed fox's tail in the previous battle.

According to Kuon, that was something like armor generated by spiritual power.

When I was first explained that, I thought, "Is that even possible?" But after a while, I remembered something.

<b>

Spiritual power is like red blood cells constantly flowing within a person's body.

<b>

If I believe the words Kuon once said, that nine-tailed fox's tail was generating solid "armor" using fluid "spiritual power."

<b>

If that's the case, couldn't I do something similar with my "Water Magic"?

<b>

While "Ice Magic" allows for relatively easy generation of objects, it has low extensibility due to being ice.

In contrast, "Water Magic" is versatile, so I should be able to create a wide range of things.

<b>

With that thought, I immediately tried it in the bathroom and successfully generated a water sphere that looked and felt almost like a glass bead, remaining intact even when touched.

And now that my level and stats have increased, the amount of MP consumed is not something I need to worry about.

Since then, I have continued to experiment to generate even more complex things with "Water Magic," and eventually, I was able to create items that were almost indistinguishable from real animals.

<b>

<b>

The items generated by "Water Magic," especially those mimicking animals, have been quite useful.

―――

<b>

The newly acquired skill, "Sensory Sharing."

<b>

This allows me to share visual and auditory senses with the target, and by activating it on animals generated by "Water Magic," I can conduct investigations and tracking more safely and in greater detail.

Moreover, once something is generated with "Water Magic," it does not disappear until I deactivate it.

<b>

For now, I mainly use it for Kana's protection, but during the forest school, I plan to utilize it significantly for investigating the legendary cursed sword.

<b>

For that reason, I need to ensure that I can generate the necessary items in a shorter time and with higher precision.

<b>

With that in mind, I resumed my research and practice for further applications and developments of "Water Magic."

<b>

<b>

<b>

And so, a week later, the day of the forest school finally arrived.
