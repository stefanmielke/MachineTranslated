# Episode 98: The Preparations for the Cultural Festival Have Begun 1

"Hey, are you leaving already?"

<b>

It was a little past 7 AM. My sister Kana, rubbing her eyes and yawning, called out to me as I finished a simple breakfast made from whatever ingredients I could find and changed into my uniform.

<b>

"Yeah, I have an appointment. I put breakfast in the fridge, so please eat that."

"Got it. Well then, take care!"

"See you later."

<b>

After finishing tying my shoelaces, I left the house and, as usual, moved to a nearby quiet alley, where I activated the 'Spatial Transfer Magic.'

In the next moment, I was transferred from the deserted alley to the desolate park where I had arranged to meet Kyori last night.

I moved to a bench and started killing time with a mobile game when a girl in the same school uniform as mine ran up to me.

<b>

"I'm sorry to keep you waiting!"

"I just came early on my own, so you don't have to worry about it. Besides, this all started because of my selfishness."

"Is that so?"

"That's how it is. Come on, let's not worry about the details and head to the station. It would be troublesome if we were late."

"Y-yes!"

<b>

I stood up from the bench and started walking with Kyori toward the nearby station.

<b>

The reason I left home early was quite simple: I wanted to spend as much time as possible with Kyori.

It's needless to say at this point, but Kyori is one of the most beautiful girls at our school. If she were to be seen with someone like me, it would undoubtedly lead to trouble.

So, our current policy is to spend as much time together as possible during the weekdays on our way to school.

Since there are few students from our school around here, it's almost impossible for anyone to witness Kyori walking with me.

Even if someone were to see us, I could just silence them with 'Recognition Disruption Magic' at that moment.

<b>

"Being with you in the morning feels quite refreshing."

"Now that you mention it, we usually meet in the evening or at night outside of school."

<b>

As I was thinking about such things, Kyori shyly started talking to me.

Well, it is indeed strange for two people of the opposite sex who aren't even dating and have completely different routes to school to be together in the morning.

When we are together, both aware of our feelings for each other, it feels like my IQ has dropped or something...

<b>

"By the way, is it still okay for you to call me 'Iori-kun' as usual?"

"Is that not okay...?"

"No, it's not that it's bad, but I'm calling you by your first name while you're still using my last name with 'kun,' and that's a bit concerning..."

<b>

I understand that what I'm saying is childish, but I can't help but feel uneasy about it.

As I was struggling with my uncontrollable feelings, Kyori looked down and took a deep breath――.

<b>

<b>

"Then, can I call you 'Shu-kun' from now on...?"

<b>

She said, blushing and looking up at me.

<b>

Kyori looked so adorable at that moment that I completely lost my words.

<b>

"―――"

"Ah, um, did I go too far!? I-I’m sorry!"

"No, that's not it! It's just that you were so cute when you called my name that I couldn't help but..."

"Eh, ...eh?"

<b>

Kyori looked surprised, or rather, confused, and stopped in her tracks.

<b>

I've done it now; there should have been a bit more of a progression! Me!

While I was intensely blaming myself and trying to change the atmosphere, we ended up reaching the station without knowing what to talk about.

<b>

"Well, I'll go ahead then...?"

"Ah, yeah. Let's meet again at school."

<b>

If we walked to school together, it would cause a commotion. So, Kyori was heading to school first, and I would use 'Spatial Transfer Magic' to go to school later to save time.

<b>

"Haah..."

<b>

Once Kyori disappeared through the ticket gate, I let out a big sigh.

<b>

And perhaps because the tension had been released, I slumped down onto a bench near the station's rotary.

<b>

(Oh, I really messed up...)

<b>

Even though it was already over, I kept coming up with countless "what ifs" to connect the conversation smoothly, and my mood grew heavier.

Should I just use 'Recognition Disruption Magic' on myself to erase this feeling of regret?

As I was thinking about that――.

<b>

"…Um, please stop it…!"

"Come on, just a little bit, let's play together, okay?"

<b>

I saw a small girl in our school's uniform being grabbed by a delinquent boy from another school, who was accompanied by his friends.

I couldn't just ignore that, so I tried to stand up from the bench――.

<b>

(…Wait a minute. Isn't this situation strange?)

<b>

The people around them were passing by without reacting as if nothing was happening.

In fact, there was a police box visible from here, and yet they were acting like that, which seemed to carry only risks. I even started to think that they might be trying to provoke the police.

And the police officers in the police box didn't react at all to their actions.

It was as if the girl and the delinquents were invisible to everyone.

<b>

(Considering the incident with the hero suit, I should investigate before intervening.)

<b>

Thinking that, I quickly activated 'Appraisal' on both the girl and the delinquents.

<b>

―――――

<b>

Ikoma Juri, Human, 17 years old

Status: Being harassed by unknown individuals and is mentally distressed. Also wishing for someone to help her.

Notes: Feeling stressed due to the worsening environment.

<b>

―――――

―――――

<b>

Agatsuma Yuya, Human, 17 years old

Status: Looking for someone to play with his delinquent friends, and has coincidentally found a girl to invite. He is also considering forcibly taking her if she refuses any further.

Notes: Currently under suspension. Has a history of being taken into custody.

<b>

―――――

<b>

I also tried to 'Appraise' the others besides Agatsuma, but they were also delinquents and were not being forcibly controlled by any abnormal abilities like during the hero suit incident.

So why is this situation happening...?

<b>

(I can think about that later. For now, let's help that person.)

<b>

Putting off the conclusion for now, I hurriedly approached the delinquents and placed my hand on Agatsuma's shoulder.

<b>

"Huh? Who the hell are you!"

"Um, that person seems to be in trouble, so could you let go of her?"

"Tch, it's none of your business!?"

<b>

I tried to speak without provoking them too much, but Agatsuma, who seemed to be the leader of the delinquents, immediately swung a punch at me.

However, his movement felt like it was in slow motion to me, and it was easily avoidable without doing anything special.

So――.

<b>

"Ugh... What the hell, you!"

"I'll say it again. She seems to be in trouble, so please let her go. Until you do, I won't let go of your hand."

<b>

I deliberately didn't avoid his punch but instead grabbed it with a bit of force and instructed him to let go of the girl――Ikoma-senpai.

Agatsuma struggled for a while to pull his fist away from my grip, but his efforts bore no fruit, and within minutes, he was panting heavily.

<b>

"Damn it!"

<b>

Finally realizing he couldn't win, Agatsuma roughly let go of Ikoma-senpai.

Once I confirmed that, I released Agatsuma's arm as promised――adding just a little more pressure――and activated 'Recognition Disruption Magic,' smiling as I did so, causing the delinquent students to scatter like spiders.

After witnessing that, I called out to the slumped Ikoma-senpai.

<b>

"Ah, are you okay?"

"Y-yes! I'm fine..."

"Is that so? By the way, should we go to the police box and report what just happened? I'll go with you."

"N-no! I can't trouble a stranger that much! I-I’m really fine..."

"…Alright. Then, excuse me."

<b>

After saying that and parting ways with Ikoma-senpai, I checked the situation around me again.

Despite the commotion that had just occurred, not a single person reacted.

Even if they didn't reach out to help, in this day and age, you'd think at least one person would be recording it on their smartphone.

<b>

(And...)

<b>

The police officers standing in front of the police box were still responding kindly to passersby as if nothing had happened.

This was beyond just a desire to avoid trouble; it was a level of indifference that was hard to comprehend.

<b>

(I should report this to Alicia later just in case...)

<b>

That aside...

<b>

(Why is it that I can talk so freely with strangers but get so nervous around Kyori...?)

<b>

With a mix of discomfort and regret, I began searching the quiet alleyways that seemed to have few people.

<b>

...Next time, I want to talk with smiles and cheerfulness. That’s what I strongly wished for.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

(Again, huh...)

<b>

On the train heading to school, the girl was deep in thought.

The ideal scenarios she had imagined in her mind were happening in reality. She had been painfully reminded over the past two months that such things were only permitted in two-dimensional worlds.

Yet, the phenomenon did not stop.

Once again, she had put a younger boy in a dangerous situation.

That guilt clouded the girl's heart.

<b>

(I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m really sorry…!)

<b>

The girl tightly hugged her bag, wishing with all her might.

Hoping that such things would never happen again.

However, in a corner of her heart, she also strongly wished for a hero to appear and save someone like her.
