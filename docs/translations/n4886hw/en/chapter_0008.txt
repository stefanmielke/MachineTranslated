# Episode 7: I Ended Up Helping Someone 1

<b>

"『Item Box』 Release"

<b>

As I released the skill, the white box disappeared, and a soccer ball and a dictionary fell to the floor with a thud from where the box had been.

<b>

"With my current skill level, I can't hold two items at once..."

<b>

Since then, I had been testing the skill "Item Box."

What I found out was that the MP consumption is uniformly 10, there are no specific weight restrictions on what can be stored, and I can carry items freely. However, I can only store one item at a time for now.

<b>

At first, I was elated to have acquired such an amazing skill that lets me "carry anything freely," but this is still quite decent.

<b>

Well, I should probably go shopping soon.

<b>

I picked up my eco-bag and was about to leave the room.

<b>

"Ah."

<b>

At that moment, by chance, the eco-bag got sucked into the white box.

<b>

Oh no, I forgot to deactivate this.

Well, it will come back just by releasing the skill, so it's not something to worry about too much.

Thinking that, I tried to deactivate "Item Box," but I suddenly noticed the "Stored Items List" in my view.

<b>

<b>

―――

<b>

"Item Box"

Stored Items List

・Eco-bag

・Receipt

<b>

―――

<b>

I thought I had misread it for a moment, rubbed my eyes, and checked again, but the contents remained unchanged.

In a hurry, I deactivated the skill and checked inside the eco-bag, and there it was, just as listed: a receipt.

<b>

"Could it be..."

<b>

I pulled out the electronic dictionary, placed it in its cover case, stored it in the item box, and checked the "Stored Items List" again.

<b>

―――

<b>

"Item Box"

Stored Items List

・Cover Case

・Electronic Dictionary

<b>

―――

<b>

Could it be that if I put something in a bag or something, it will be treated as a single item?

If that's the case, it could be misused in various ways.

<b>

"Well, I really need to get going soon."

<b>

Then I remembered that I had planned to go shopping.

I decided to continue the testing tomorrow.

<b>

I prepared to go out again and left the house.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"That'll be a total of 3255 yen! How would you like to pay?"

"Cash."

"Understood. Please proceed to register number 7!"

<b>

I completed the payment as usual, packed my purchases into the eco-bag, and left the store.

Then, I moved to a less crowded area and activated "Item Box."

<b>

"Here we go."

<b>

―――

<b>

"Item Box"

Stored Items List

・Eco-bag

・2 kg of rice

300 grams of meat

1 cabbage

3 onions

………

……

…

<b>

―――

<b>

I confirmed that everything was stored safely and let out a sigh of relief.

If it hadn't worked, my items would have fallen to the ground, resulting in a disaster.

<b>

"Time to head home."

<b>

I packed the white box—"Item Box"—into the now-empty eco-bag and started walking home.

<b>

"Hey, Iori-kun?"

<b>

Suddenly, I heard a voice from behind me.

When I turned around, there was a girl about my age wearing an apron.

<b>

"You are...?"

"Oh, this is the first time we've met like this. Do you remember me? I'm Haruna Fujisawa."

<b>

Fujisawa... Fujisawa...

<b>

"Ah, the class representative!"

"I'm glad you remembered me."

<b>

Fujisawa-san smiled with a look of relief.

<b>

"So, what do you need from me?"

"Um, I just happened to see you and called out. Sorry about that."

"No, it's fine. By the way, what are you doing here, Fujisawa-san?"

"I'm here for dinner shopping. What about you, Iori-kun?"

"I'm doing the same."

"Oh, Iori-kun cooks?"

"I can only make simple things, though."

<b>

As we were chatting, Fujisawa-san suddenly looked startled and bowed her head to me.

<b>

"Sorry for stopping you. See you in class tomorrow!"

"Uh, yeah. See you tomorrow."

<b>

Fujisawa-san ran off to the supermarket as if escaping from something scary.

I wondered what had happened, and then I caught a glimpse of something resembling a bruise peeking out from the hem of her jacket.

<b>

"……'Appraisal'"

<b>

Feeling a pang of guilt, I activated the skill "Appraisal" on Fujisawa-san.

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Haruna Fujisawa, Human, 14 years old

Condition: Malnutrition, Contusion, Mood Disorder

Notes: Physically and mentally exhausted due to abuse and threats.

<b>

―――

<b>

I was left speechless by the displayed information.

Malnutrition? Abuse? Threats?

I couldn't help but doubt that "Appraisal" was showing incorrect information, but I had no way to verify it.

<b>

"……I should go home."

<b>

In any case, without solid evidence, there was nothing I could do at the moment.

<b>

I headed home with a gloomy mood.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

"You carried all this back by yourself...?"

<b>

As I was putting the items I bought into the refrigerator, Kana returned from the dojo, looking surprised.

<b>

"I've been training for a while now. This was a piece of cake."

"Hmm."

<b>

She responded with forced cheerfulness, but soon directed a suspicious gaze at me before losing interest and grabbing a sports drink from the refrigerator, downing it.

That's when I noticed that Kana seemed a bit down.

<b>

"Did something happen?"

"…Today, I heard that the senior who had been so nice to me since I came here quit the dojo. I had been prepared for it since she hadn't been coming for months, but..."

<b>

I see, so that's why she was feeling down.

But I never expected Kana to be this invested.

I wondered what kind of person that senior was.

<b>

"Why did she stop coming?"

"She said there were various difficulties at home. I want to see her again, Fujisawa-senpai."

"…Fujisawa?"

"Yeah, Haruna Fujisawa-senpai. She's really strong and kind, and everyone adored her. I think she goes to the same school as your brother and is the class representative."

<b>

Haruna Fujisawa, the class representative from the same school as me...

It's almost certain that she is the "Fujisawa-san" I just met.

I think I should check on her again.

<b>

"Hey, did something happen to you, brother?"

"By the way, tomorrow's duty was yours, right?"

"Yeah, that's right..."

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I'll take care of tomorrow's duty. You just rest, Kana."
