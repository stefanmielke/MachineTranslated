# Episode 31: I Decided to Investigate 4

――side Alicia

<b>

“...Clear”

<b>

Having sneaked into the mansion where the Yamafuji Group's headquarters is located, I let out a deep breath.

I have infiltrated various organizations for operations, but no matter how many times I do it, I can never get used to this feeling.

Any agent can easily die if luck is not on their side.

Thinking about that, I must have been truly lucky.

<b>

(Alright, let’s get started)

<b>

I pulled out the handgun equipped with a special suppressor from my holster and began to move towards the basement.

<b>

I already knew where the stairs to the basement were. Of course, I also had the route to get there and the number of guards along the way.

<b>

(...3 people, just as reported)

<b>

At the end of the hallway, two men with guns and one man with a short blade were guarding a sturdy iron door.

<b>

I slipped into their midst in one breath, taking out the consciousness of one gunman and one blade-wielder with a spinning kick.

<b>

“Y-you... gah!?”

<b>

The remaining man instinctively pointed his gun at me and prepared to pull the trigger, but before he could, my shoe struck his face.

<b>

...Phew, I'm glad I didn't waste any bullets.

<b>

Confirming that all the men were unconscious, I stood in front of the password input device installed next to the iron door.

From prior information, I knew that the password for this door does not reset periodically and is always the same.

All I had to do was trace the marks on the buttons――.

<b>

(Good, breakthrough successful)

<b>

I slowly opened the iron door and worked to ensure that no one could easily enter from the inside as I descended the dark staircase.

Having adjusted my eyes to the darkness before coming here, I was able to move smoothly.

In less than five minutes, I arrived at the desired basement... but.

<b>

“...What is this room?”

<b>

What lay before me was a dimly lit room resembling an operating theater.

Various instruments hung from the walls, and shelves were filled with bottles containing liquids of various colors, but what caught my eye even more was a mass of flesh the size of a child lying on the operating table.

<b>

It looked as if it had been cut from some gigantic entity, still pulsating and releasing a small amount of smoke from its surface.

Could this be the root cause that drove the Yamafuji Group, or rather Nagamoto, insane?

<b>

‘This is Team B "Vator." "Scouter," please respond.’

<b>

As I pondered this, a voice came through the intercom.

"Scouter" is my call sign for this operation.

<b>

“This is 'Scouter.' How's it going? What's the situation on your end?”

‘We successfully captured the rat. No injuries, we will now escort him home.’

“Understood. Also, could you send a few reinforcements my way? The target is significantly larger than expected, and I can't carry it alone.”

‘Understood. I will send backup personnel to you immediately.’

“Okay, I’ll be waiting.”

<b>

With that, I cut the communication.

Now, if I could also capture the key figure, Nagamoto, it would be perfect.

<b>

“Oh my, what a cute young lady has wandered in here.”

<b>

Suddenly, I heard a voice from behind me.

I instinctively took a step back and pointed my gun at the source of the voice.

<b>

Standing there was an elderly man in a green tracksuit, looking like someone you could find anywhere.

However, his eyes were filled with clear madness and murderous intent.

This matched the information I had gathered beforehand.

There was no doubt, this was Nagamoto.

<b>

“Are you the rumored public security agent? I thought you were just an urban legend, but to think I would actually meet you.”

“...How did you break through that blockade? May I ask for my future reference?”

“Oh, nothing special. I just...”

<b>

Nagamoto grabbed a nearby shelf and effortlessly lifted it, throwing it at me.

<b>

“I’m just following the voice.”

“...Voice?”

“Oh yes. I don’t know when it started, but I began to hear a voice from somewhere. If I follow that voice, even an old man like me can do things like that.”

<b>

Saying this, Nagamoto threw another shelf at me.

I dodged it and tried to shoot him with a few bullets, but he deflected them with the operating table like a stick.

<b>

I didn’t understand what he was saying, but it was bad if this situation continued.

He had transcended the limits of a human. With my current equipment, there was no way I could stop that monster.

<b>

At this moment, those words came back to me.

<b>

“Any agent can easily die if luck is not on their side.”

<b>

“Sorry, young lady. I have no grudge against you, but this is necessary for us to survive. So just give up and die――Gyaaaah!?”

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, Nagamoto's body was blown away with a strange scream.

His aged body crashed into the wall, scattering the items that were strewn about the room.

<b>

“Oops, I might have miscalculated the force.”

<b>

At the same time, a carefree voice echoed from somewhere.

I quickly turned to the direction of the voice and saw a boy about my age in sportswear.

<b>

(…Iori, Shu)

<b>

Yes, there stood Iori Shu, the very person I was monitoring.
