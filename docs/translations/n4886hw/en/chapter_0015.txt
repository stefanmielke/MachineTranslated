# Episode 13 Encounter with the Angel of the Academy

Just over 10 minutes after transferring trains.

The area in front of the high school’s main gate was bustling with students and their parents taking commemorative photos.

The entrance ceremony for high school is an event that one experiences only once in a lifetime. It is entirely natural to capture those memories in photos and videos.

In fact, my dad was also eager to come if he didn’t have work scheduled.

<b>

Somehow navigating through the crowd, I entered the school building and headed straight for the classroom.

After this, I was supposed to go to the classroom and meet my classmates and teachers.

I had already been informed of which class I would be in.

For now, I’ll try to act inconspicuously and avoid drawing attention to myself.

<b>

"Ah, there it is."

<b>

1-C, that’s the class I will be spending the next year in.

<b>

"…Alright."

<b>

Feeling slightly nervous, I entered the classroom through the back door.

At that moment, about 20 students who were already in the classroom turned their gazes towards me all at once.

They were probably eager to assess what kind of person I was.

Feeling bewildered by their unfamiliar stares, I looked at the seating chart posted on the blackboard and headed to my seat.

<b>

(Oh, lucky me. It’s the seat all the way at the back by the window.)

<b>

It seems that neither the homeroom teacher nor the student next to me has arrived yet.

Then I should be able to relax for a little while.

<b>

As I was thinking that, the students suddenly began to buzz with excitement.

"Did something happen!?" I felt a moment of anxiety, but judging by the reactions of the surrounding students, it seemed that was unfounded.

If that’s the case, what are they reacting to? I thought as I traced their gazes.

<b>

<b>

What I saw was a girl whose appearance was so striking it felt unreal.

Her brown hair, tied in a bun, was so shiny it reflected light, and her skin was as white as a doll’s. Her long eyelashes and large eyes added to her almost otherworldly presence.

<b>

Without caring about the gazes of the other students, she checked the seating chart on the blackboard and placed her bag on the seat next to mine.

Then, as she sat down, she flashed a gentle smile and nodded.

I responded by bowing my head in a similar manner, and we both turned our gazes in different directions.

<b>

"Good morning, everyone."

<b>

Just at that moment, a petite young female teacher, presumably the homeroom teacher, entered the classroom.

In response, the other students returned to their respective seats.

<b>

"It seems everyone is here. I am Koshimizu Aoi, and I will be your homeroom teacher for class 1-C. I look forward to spending this year with you."

<b>

The female teacher—Ms. Koshimizu—wrote her name on the blackboard and gave a slight bow.

<b>

"Now, let’s have everyone introduce themselves. First, let’s start with… student number 1, Aizawa."

"Y-yes! I’m Aizawa Toru! I played basketball in middle school. Nice to meet you!"

"Thank you. Now, next is student number 2—"

<b>

After a few students finished their introductions, it was soon my turn.

I stood up, thinking about how this was the fate of those born with surnames starting with 'A'.

<b>

"Um, Iori Shu. My hobbies are gaming, and my specialty is cooking. I look forward to this year."

<b>

I quickly finished my brief and unremarkable introduction and sat back down.

The introductions continued without incident, and finally, it was the turn of the girl next to me.

<b>

"I am Kuon Kyori. Nice to meet you."

<b>

At that moment, did I feel a strong sense of rejection from her—Kyori Kuon? Or was it just my imagination?

Well, in any case, she and I were from different worlds.

It was unlikely we would become friends in the future.

Thinking that, I listened to my classmates’ rather uninteresting introductions.

<b>

<b>

A week had passed since the entrance ceremony.

After having dinner as usual and returning to my room, I cast "Recognition Inhibition Magic" on myself to avoid being reported and changed into my tracksuit, then set the timer on my watch.

<b>

"Alright, let’s do this."

<b>

Opening the window, I climbed onto the roof with a light step, just like yesterday, and began to move by jumping from roof to roof.

For now, I wanted to test how far I could go with my current stamina.

In that case, it would be better to head towards the mountains rather than the station.

<b>

I repeatedly made large jumps, moving from the city to farmland along the national highway, and then onto mountain paths.

After about 30 minutes, I found myself in a dimly lit area of the mountains where the lights of the downtown area were completely out of sight.

<b>

Physically, I still felt fine, but if I went any further, it might become troublesome with dirt and other issues when I used "Spatial Transfer Magic" to return.

Maybe I should wrap it up here and head home.

<b>

"…Huh?"

<b>

As I was thinking that, I heard shouting and what sounded like an explosion coming from somewhere.

What on earth could be happening in such a remote mountain area? Unable to suppress my curiosity, I ran towards the source of the sound.

<b>

A few seconds later, I arrived at an unnaturally open area that resembled a wide clearing.

"Recognition Inhibition Magic" should still be effective, but just to be safe, I hid behind some cover and approached what seemed to be the source of the noise, where I saw two figures.

<b>

<b>

"…No way."

<b>

What was unfolding before me was a scene I had only seen in games or anime.

<b>

One figure was a demon, with a body resembling that of a lower elementary school student, covered in black skin, desperately swinging a small knife with a fierce expression.

<b>

And the other was— 

<b>

"…I can’t believe I’d run into you like this."

<b>

Despite being covered in wounds and blood, the girl in a shrine maiden outfit, Kuon Kyori, was glaring at the demon with a similarly desperate look.
