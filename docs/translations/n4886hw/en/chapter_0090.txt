# Episode 86 The Decisive Battle Has Begun 1

"Are you okay?"

"Yes, I'm somehow..."

<b>

We had flown straight to the source of that voice using 'Wind Magic', but the surrounding area was shrouded in a thick red mist, making it impossible to grasp what was around us.

<b>

In any case, we had to move forward, I thought as I took a step, and at that moment.

<b>

"Whoa!?"

"Iori-kun!?"

<b>

My foot slipped into the air, and I almost fell off.

<b>

"Whoa, that was close..."

"Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?"

"Ah, yeah. I'm fine. But this is..."

<b>

Perhaps due to the impact, the red mist dispersed, revealing what was below.

<b>

The first thing I realized was that we were walking on the edge of a massive, bowl-shaped pit.

And another thing I realized was――.

<b>

"Is that the main body of the one who was shouting just now...?"

<b>

At the bottom of the pit, there was a humanoid red tree, about 50 meters tall, stretching its arms as if reaching for the sky.

The tree vibrated as if it were breathing, simultaneously releasing a large amount of red mist from the gaps in its trunk.

<b>

(……'Appraisal')

<b>

―――――

<b>

Target: Type A Large-Scale Replacement Technique

Effect: Appears as a gigantic tree.

It unfolds using a catalyst as its core, absorbing energy from powerful beings to significantly enhance the strength, capacity, and soul rank of a specific individual.

Additionally, it constantly generates red mist, exhausting the physical and mental strength of those nearby.

Status: Currently in an inactive state to absorb energy.

Note: The target of the technique is Kuon Genji. The caster is ■■■ of ■■.

<b>

―――――

<b>

There are many unclear aspects, but one thing is certain: that thing is currently sleeping to gather power.

<b>

I quickly generated a simple reconnaissance drone and sent it down the slope to the bottom of the pit.

<b>

At a glance, the pit seemed to be easily over 100 meters deep. It would take some time for that drone to reach the bottom.

That means now is the only time to ask.

<b>

"Can I ask you something? You said earlier that 'only I can stop this situation.' What’s the basis for that?"

<b>

When I asked, Kyori stopped and directed her gaze toward the bottom of the pit filled with red mist.

<b>

"He, Kuon Genji, has been absorbing power from others through a special artifact that has been passed down in this family for generations."

"Artifact?"

"It is said to be a relic created by the first head of the Kuon family. It can absorb the spiritual energy of latent entities in the surroundings and convert it into immense energy. It seems that Kuon Genji was using that as a catalyst to gain power."

<b>

An artifact, huh.

I didn't think it would come to that state without some sort of mechanism, but I never imagined it would be something like that...

<b>

"So, what does that artifact have to do with your statement of 'only I can'?"

"The creation of the artifact used the blood of the first head of the Kuon family, which means my ancestor. Only those who carry the blood of Kuon can touch it."

<b>

I see, so that's why she wanted to go with me.

From what I gathered, it seems like it could potentially be nullified with 'Dispel'... 

<b>

(That first head might also be a person with an abnormal ability like me. It would be better to leave it to Kyori to some extent...)

<b>

As I was thinking about this, the drone signaled that it had reached the bottom.

I stopped the conversation and activated 'Sensory Sharing' to share vision with the drone, which was patiently waiting at the bottom of the pit.

<b>

(Now, I at least want to find that artifact... Hmm?)

<b>

The red tree had countless thin, branch-like extensions reaching toward something at the very bottom of the trunk.

However, due to the red mist, I still couldn't tell what was there even after coming this far down.

<b>

"…Kyori, please keep an eye on the surroundings."

"Eh, ah, yes! Understood!"

<b>

I intensified the sensitivity of 'Sensory Sharing' and carefully maneuvered the drone.

Before long, the drone reached a flat rock that seemed suitable for landing.

<b>

As the drone landed on the rock, the impact blew away the surrounding red mist.

And at the same time, my vision, which had been obstructed by the thick mist, became clearer――.

<b>

(Huh...!?)

<b>

What appeared made me feel nauseous.

At the end of those branches was a man, emaciated like a mummified corpse, lying on his back.

The man was unconscious, and something was being drawn from the branch that pierced his head.

This alone was enough to be creepy, but what was even more disturbing was...

<b>

(What the hell is this number...!?)

<b>

Right next to the man, there was a woman who, due to her mummified appearance, was difficult to recognize at first glance, also lying on her back and being drained by a branch piercing her head.

And that wasn't all.

Nearby was another man, and even closer was another woman; there were so many people being drained alive that counting them would be endless.

<b>

After circling the drone around the massive tree trunk and confirming that there were no signs of Kuon Genji or the thorns, I turned my attention to a man who was lying near the landing site.

<b>

('Appraisal'...!)

<b>

――――

<b>

Kuon Toya, Human, 61 years old

Status: Unconscious, severe spiritual energy deficiency, malnutrition, paralysis

Note: His power has been taken by Kuon Genji through the replacement technique.

<b>

――――

<b>

I used 'Appraisal' on the person who was lying closest, and the result confirmed that this man was indeed being drained of power by that creepy tree.

<b>

In any case, I had no means to help these people right now, and since I realized that Kuon Genji and the thorns were not at the bottom, there was little point in focusing on this place.

<b>

Just as I was thinking about whether to bring the drone back or just dissolve it into water, at that very moment.

<b>

<b>

"Kyori... KyoriIIIIII!!"

<b>

A figure stood up in the crack emitting a faint red light at the center of the tree, and the humanoid tree vibrated as if it were breathing again, echoing that scream throughout the surroundings.

<b>

Furthermore, the branches of the tree suddenly grew rapidly, sharpening their tips like spears, and attacked us with the flexibility of whips.

<b>

"Damn it... This really is endless...!"

<b>

I used 'Ice Magic' to freeze and destroy the tips of the branches, but the next moment, newly grown branches rapidly grew and attacked again.

<b>

"…Iori-kun, Kuon Genji is likely inside that crack in the center."

<b>

While struggling to deal with the branches, Kyori, who was handling another branch with flames from a talisman, conveyed this.

Given what I saw from the drone earlier, Kyori's guess was probably correct.

<b>

"Got it. Then I'll create a direct route to that place now. Kyori, please handle the branches."

"Yes...!"

<b>

I focused my consciousness on the bundle of branches extending directly from the tree.

And――.

<b>

('Water Magic', followed by 'Ice Magic'!)

<b>

Water flowed down from above the branches like a waterfall, and immediately froze with 'Ice Magic', forming an ice staircase.

<b>

(Ugh... Using this many skills is tough...)

<b>

Signs of running out of MP appeared, and I almost stumbled for a moment, but I managed to hold on with sheer will and turned back to Kyori.

<b>

"Kyori, let's go!"

"Yes!"

<b>

...From here on out, I can only rely on this body, not skills.

Thinking that, I grabbed Kyori's hand, and we dashed up the ice staircase.
