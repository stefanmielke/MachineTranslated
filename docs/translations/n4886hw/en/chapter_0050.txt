# Episode 46: The Test of Courage Has Begun 2

Rushing toward the direction of the scream, I found Rentaro and Kobayashi, breathless and collapsed.

<b>

"Hey, are you okay?"

"Yikes!? Ah... it's Shu and Kuon-san."

<b>

When I called out to them, Kobayashi flinched for a moment, but upon seeing our faces, he let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"That was a terrifying scream. Did something happen?"

"Y-yeah... Near the fourth checkpoint ahead..."

<b>

"... there was a ghost."

<b>

At that moment, Rentaro, who had been staring down in silence, finally spoke up.

<b>

"A ghost?"

"There was a woman in a kimono under the shade of a tree, and I thought I’d ask her what she was doing. Then her face... her face turned into a skeleton..."

<b>

He must have seen something truly horrifying.

Rentaro's body trembled as if he had jumped into cold water while recounting his experience.

<b>

"Here, drink this to calm down."

"Ah, thanks."

<b>

I handed them sports drinks, and they gulped them down in one go.

Looking at their sweat-soaked shirts, it seemed they had run away at full speed from the place where they saw that ghost.

... Just to be safe, I should also cast 'Healing Magic' and 'Recognition Inhibition Magic.'

<b>

"How about it? Do you think you can move?"

"Y-yeah. I'm okay now."

"Should I call the teachers?"

"No, we can't trouble Kuon-san and the others any further. We'll go back to the previous checkpoint, so you guys go ahead."

"… Understood."

<b>

Having regained some composure and stamina thanks to the skills, Rentaro and Kobayashi said that and turned back the way they came.

<b>

<b>

"So, what do you think, expert in exorcism?"

"There was a trace of youkai on Asama-san's body, albeit in small amounts. I believe it’s probably true."

<b>

I felt no surprise at her answer.

This was because, just before Rentaro and the others returned, I had used 'Appraisal' and confirmed that they were not lying.

<b>

As I pondered what to do next, I realized something.

<b>

"Hey. That scream Rentaro and the others let out was pretty loud, right?"

"Huh? Yes, it was. I could even hear it from the detour we took..."

<b>

Kuon seemed to understand what I was getting at, her expression turning serious.

<b>

Yes, if such a loud scream was raised, a teacher or guide should have rushed to the scene first.

Yet we were the first to arrive.

<b>

('Appraisal')

<b>

I vaguely targeted the very space we were in and activated the skill 'Appraisal.'

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Maze

Effect: Confines specific organisms that have entered the barrier into a special closed space. Also forcibly expels organisms without special abilities outside the barrier.

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Note: Modified to target only those with special abilities.

<b>

<b>

―――

<b>

"… Hah, we’ve been had."

<b>

I sighed at what was displayed by the skill 'Appraisal.'

Most likely, Rentaro and the others were used as bait to scare us.

We, the true targets behind this abnormal situation, or more precisely, those with abnormal powers, were meant to be captured.

<b>

<b>

"Iori-kun, this is..."

"Yeah, it seems we've been caught."

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"… I never thought it would come to this."

<b>

As I poured water generated by 'Water Magic' into an empty plastic bottle taken from my 'Item Box,' I muttered to myself.

While doing so, Kuon approached from the opposite path, looking tired.

<b>

"It's no use. No matter which path we take back, we can't get outside."

"So, you’re saying they don’t intend to let us escape that easily."

<b>

I sighed and shifted my gaze to my wristwatch.

The digital clock displayed the same time as when I encountered Rentaro and the others.

It seemed that time flowed differently in this space compared to the outside.

And that also meant the likelihood of rescue arriving was almost nonexistent.

<b>

<b>

"Can’t we use the 'Spatial Transfer' you showed us before to escape?"

"I don’t know. We might be able to escape without any trouble, or we could end up transferring into a rock and get crushed. It’s better to save that as a last resort."

<b>

Saying that, I handed Kuon the bottle filled with cold water.

Well, by now, enough time should have passed for things to have developed.

<b>

('Shared Senses')

<b>

With the activation of the skill, different scenes were projected into my view one after another.

While Kuon was out investigating, I had released numerous insects and birds generated by 'Water Magic' into this space.

<b>

The main purposes were threefold: first, to determine how vast this abnormal space was; second, to check if the culprit behind the situation was in this space; and third, if they were, to find out where they were located.

As I checked the views from the 'Water Magic Animals' for anything suspicious, I spotted a shadow in the northwest direction.

Following that shadow, I saw three men forming a defensive formation around a rusty sword.

<b>

I couldn't tell if they were the culprits behind the series of phenomena, but at the very least, they were not unrelated.

Concluding that, I informed Kuon, who was contemplating escape methods.

<b>

<b>

"I found someone who seems relevant, shall we go check it out?"

<b>

"Hah... Hah!?"
