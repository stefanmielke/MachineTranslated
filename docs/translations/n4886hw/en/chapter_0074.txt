# Episode 70: Invited to the Mansion 3

"......Alright"

<b>

After finishing lunch and returning to my room, I sent the promised photo to Rentaro and laid out the piece of paper given by Ueshima-san and the letter brought by the Kuon family's shikigami on the bed.

I had been thinking about which one to look at first, but I finally made my decision.

<b>

I gently picked up the piece of paper handed to me by Ueshima-san and opened it.

<b>

(……Is this an ID?)

<b>

What was written on the piece of paper seemed to be an ID for a chat app, along with a message saying, "If you'd like, please contact me."

I opened the chat app on my smartphone and entered the ID, and an account that seemed to belong to Ueshima-san appeared.

<b>

(Should I try what it says?)

<b>

I decided to send a message without revealing my personal name, just saying, "I saw the contents of the note," and immediately received a reply: "Thank you for contacting me, Iori-kun."

Yeah, it's definitely Ueshima-san.

<b>

I then sent, "So, what's the matter?"

After a few seconds, I received a long message: "I have something to tell you about Kuon-san. She seemed tired enough to notice even over the phone. Also, she looked a bit unwell."

<b>

She seemed tired enough to notice even over the phone?

Since it was said that she couldn't take calls during Obon, that conversation must have happened before then...

<b>

"Did you tell Kuon-san that she looked unwell?"

"I did. I asked, 'You seem a bit down, are you okay?' She said she was just a little fatigued from the summer heat. But Kuon-san tends to endure a bit when it comes to her own issues."

<b>

I agree with Ueshima-san's opinion.

I can't imagine that Kuon would honestly show any weakness, and it's hard to believe that someone involved in such a family business would be weakened to that extent by summer fatigue.

<b>

Suddenly, I had a question.

<b>

"By the way, why did you think to tell me about this?"

<b>

When I sent that message, Ueshima-san seemed to go silent, as if she had stopped responding.

I wondered if she had to step away from her phone, and just then...

<b>

"Um, Iori-kun, you're dating Kuon-san, right?"

<b>

I couldn't help but burst out laughing at the message that came in.

Me? With that Kuon?

<b>

"No way! There's no way someone like me could be dating Kuon!"

<b>

I, who just pokes my nose into various things out of curiosity, am on a completely different level from Kuon, who is talented, beautiful, has a great personality, is liked by everyone, and has a strong sense of responsibility.

I mean, what kind of thought process leads to the idea that I'm dating Kuon!?

<b>

As I panicked over the unexpected reply, another message from Ueshima-san came in like a follow-up.

<b>

"Is that so? You seemed really close during the school trip, and when Kuon-san talks about you, she blushes and tries to hide something, so I thought maybe you were dating."

<b>

I don't understand why she would blush when I talk about her, but the reason it looked like they were getting along during the school trip was because of the work related to that cursed sword, and the hiding was probably because Ueshima-san is not familiar with such occult matters.

In any case, there is no fact of a relationship between me and Kuon. That much is certain.

<b>

"That's all a misunderstanding. Kuon and I are just classmates, nothing more, nothing less. And if we were dating, I would know more about Kuon's absence today, right?"

<b>

After I replied, there was a brief pause before I received the message, "That makes sense."

Then came, "I'm sorry! I misunderstood! Can you keep what I said a secret from Kuon-san and others?"

When I replied, "Got it," I received a message saying, "I'm really sorry!" and then we chatted a bit before the conversation naturally ended.

<b>

...I can't believe there are people who mistakenly think I'm dating Kuon.

Feeling flustered inside, I shifted my gaze to the letter.

<b>

(This seems troublesome in its own way...)

<b>

But I couldn't help but open it.

Just to be safe, I activated "Magic Counter" on myself and carefully opened the seal.

<b>

What came out was a folded letter that looked like it belonged in a historical drama, with the sender's name written in elegant handwriting as Kuon Sogen.

As for the content, it began with gratitude for the cooperation I had given to Kuon.

And it stated that as a token of appreciation for my cooperation so far, she wanted to invite me to the main residence of the Kuon family to reward me.

The timing was set for the upcoming long weekend in two weeks, and just like the shikigami had mentioned, it asked me to drop a drop of blood on the letter if I accepted the invitation by that day.

<b>

(……This feels like a trap)

<b>

I don't have any concrete evidence, but I instinctively felt that there might be something behind it.

Surely, if I accept this invitation, I would be able to learn about Kuon's current situation.

However, I can't be sure if the person who sent this letter truly feels grateful to me, and they might be setting a trap.

Moreover, the person who handed me this letter knew where I lived.

In the worst-case scenario, there is a possibility that they might take Kana hostage while I'm away.

In fact, this is my biggest concern.

But still.

<b>

(……I can't help but be curious. I wonder how Kuon is doing now.)

<b>

Kuon's absence and Ueshima-san's words.

After hearing that, the image of Kuon from the day of the entrance ceremony, radiating a strong will of rejection that kept everyone at bay, flickered in my mind.

<b>

(For now, I should send a message to Kuon and see how things go.)

<b>

I opened the app again and sent a message to Kuon, "I heard you were absent from school, are you okay?" then I lay back on the bed.

<b>

I'll hold off on making a judgment about the letter for now.

I want to hear from Alicia as well, but she probably won't respond if I suddenly send her a message.

If I'm going to talk to her, it would be better to go see her in person with this letter.

<b>

"......I'm tired."

<b>

I'm on kitchen duty today, but I have time until dinner. So, I figured it would probably be okay to take a little nap.

<b>

Thinking that, I placed my smartphone with the alarm set next to my pillow and closed my eyes.

Soon, the overwhelming fatigue and drowsiness washed over me, and I quickly fell asleep.
