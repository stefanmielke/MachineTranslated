# Chapter 74: Invited to the Mansion 2

“““Welcome. The entire Kuon family sincerely welcomes you, Lord Iori.”””

(Oh... this is something else)

<b>

As I arrived at a luxurious mansion resembling a long-established inn in a tourist area and got out of the car, I was greeted with a simultaneous bow from what seemed to be the servants of the Kuon family waiting for me.

Overwhelmed and bewildered by the scene, a woman in her early twenties approached me.

<b>

“You must be tired from your long journey. We have prepared a room for you, so please allow me to guide you.”

“Ah... thank you very much.”

<b>

Saying that, the woman began to walk deeper into the mansion, leading me.

Then, right before us.

<b>

(“Identification”)

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Servant-type Shikigami

Effect: A crowd-type Shikigami designed to perform general household tasks. It possesses a certain level of self-defense and information-sharing capabilities.

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Notes: Materialized by a large-scale magic formation pre-installed in the Kuon family mansion. Current mission is to entertain Iori Shu.

<b>

――――

<b>

I had a hunch, but it turns out these guys are also Shikigami.

However, judging by the results of “Identification,” they don’t seem to think this body is a doll made to resemble a human, and for now, they don’t seem to have any intention of attacking me.

That said, I can’t definitively say it’s completely safe, and frankly, this fake body is quite weak compared to me.

So, I’ll have to be somewhat cautious.

<b>

As I was thinking about this, the Shikigami stopped in front of a door.

<b>

“This will be the room where you will be staying, Lord Iori.”

“Oh...”

<b>

When the door opened, it revealed another luxurious guest room with tatami flooring.

From the large glass windows, a magnificent view of the mountains could be seen, and there was even an outdoor hot spring.

<b>

“I believe I will be visiting again, but until then, please relax and make yourself comfortable. Also, if you proceed left down the hallway after exiting the door, you will find the large public bath. Feel free to enter at your leisure.”

<b>

Oh, a large public bath. They even have that.

Now that I think about it, since the entire clan is gathering, they might need to invest in accommodations as well.

<b>

“Well then, I will take my leave here. If you need anything, please ring the bell on the desk. Until then.”

<b>

Saying that, the Shikigami bowed to me once more and exited the room.

<b>

...Finally, I can be alone.

<b>

(First, I need to understand the structure of this mansion and where the Kuon family is located.)

<b>

With that thought in mind, I quickly transformed the left hand of the fake body into a liquid state, splitting it into countless small drones and sending them into the mansion.

<b>

(The “Sensory Sharing” with the drones is functioning. Now, next...)

<b>

After confirming that the drones were operating as designed, I directed the fake body towards the outdoor hot spring and had it release water.

Once I confirmed that there were no people around, I brought the left wrist of the fake body close to the water.

Then, the water seemed to leap into the wrist, being absorbed into the cross-section, and immediately transformed into a new left hand.

<b>

(...It really does look like a creature from a horror movie.)

<b>

I would have preferred to regenerate the missing part more neatly, but well, that’s just a matter of personal preference, so I’ll try not to think about it for now.

<b>

Now, this fake body is based on a humanoid frame embedded with sensory organs made from ice generated by “Ice Magic,” constructed using “Design” and “Blacksmithing Techniques,” while ensuring that the internal frame does not melt using “Wind Magic” and “Water Magic,” resembling me on the outside, and employing “Recognition Disruption Magic” extensively to avoid suspicion.

There are three notable advantages to this fake body.

The first is that it can repair itself by absorbing surrounding water in the event of damage.

The second is its high expandability. Since the surface of this fake body is water, if designed in advance, it can change various body parts into different shapes, as seen earlier.

And the third is that, in the unfortunate event that this fake body is destroyed, only water or steam will remain at the scene.

This makes it easier to eliminate evidence or confuse the enemy's gaze.

<b>

While I’ve listed all these advantages, unfortunately, there are also quite a few disadvantages.

First, at my current “Blacksmithing Techniques” skill level, it takes several days to create a single fake body.

Next is its low combat power. This fake body is, after all, a separate entity from me, so it does not possess its own level or status, and can only use the skills I have pre-installed. The transformation is currently achieved by sending MP through “Sensory Sharing.”

And the biggest drawback is that this fake body is entirely dependent on my “Sensory Sharing.”

If it encounters a technique or ability that disrupts skills, this fake body will become completely useless.

Therefore, I need to exercise utmost caution when operating it.

<b>

Now, back to the main topic.

<b>

As the repair of the missing parts was completed, I attempted to have the fake body sit down to avoid wasting effort when information from the small drones projected onto my retina.

<b>

(Ah, if I were to walk normally, I would never reach the Kuon family.)

<b>

Given that this is the mansion of an exorcist, I expected it to be different from a regular building, but the structure of the mansion sent by the drones far exceeded my expectations.

<b>

First of all, it seems that this mansion somehow distorts the internal space, making it far larger than it appears.

Moreover, it seems that there are various magical formations embedded throughout the mansion that allow for free teleportation, as the drones captured images of servant-type Shikigami using them to move around.

And what concerns me the most is the unnaturally dim rooms and staircases that the Shikigami consciously avoid entering.

Of course, I tried to have the drones capture footage of the interiors, but what returned was a darkness akin to an abyss.

Whether it’s a trap for intruders or something important to the Kuon family is concealed, the truth is unknown, but it would be best to refrain from entering until more information is gathered.

<b>

In any case, I have a rough understanding of the structure of this mansion. Now, all that’s left is...

<b>

As I was thinking about this, there was a light knock on the door, followed by the same voice of the Shikigami that guided me.

<b>

“Lord Iori, the head of the family has expressed a strong desire to meet you. I apologize for interrupting your relaxation, but could you please come to the great hall?”

<b>

Oh, the head of the Kuon family is calling for me all of a sudden.

Since I can still share information with all the drones, it’s unlikely that they discovered what I was doing... but still, the other party is said to be the top exorcist. It wouldn’t be wise to do anything that might offend them.

Moreover, upon further reflection, this is a perfect opportunity to confirm the safety of the Kuon family.

That leaves me with no reason to decline this invitation.

<b>

“Understood! I will head there immediately!”

<b>

Now, it’s time for a meeting with the provisional big boss.
