# 第53話　肝だめしが始まりました　9

Returning to the original course and regaining my composure, I once again appraise the sword I hold.

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Spirit Sword "Mumei"

Condition: Good

Notes: A famous sword that was once sealed as a cursed blade.

As a result of the long-embedded feelings and the purified soul of the samurai that resided within, it has evolved into a spirit sword capable of severing the formless.

<b>

――――

<b>

However, I never expected that the rusty, battered cursed sword could transform into such a beautiful blade.

Was the grudge of the samurai that possessed it so overwhelming, or was it the result of a backlash from its passing into the afterlife?

As I ponder this, I take hold of the sword and, feeling its texture and examining the blade, I am once again in awe of its craftsmanship.

<b>

“! That’s…”

“It’s a reward for helping it pass on. It seems it’s no longer a cursed sword, so I don’t think it will cause harm to the surroundings like before.”

“...What do you plan to do with it, Iori-kun?”

“If possible, I’d like to keep it as it is, but is that not okay...?”

<b>

For now, I have the "Item Box" for storage, so it probably won't escalate into a big commotion.

Even if there are those who might come after it, I can just repel them as I have until now and make it seem like “nothing happened.”

Besides, swords aren’t something you can easily come by, and more than anything, it’s such a cool item that I want to keep it close and admire it.

<b>

The problem was whether Kuon and the others with special abilities would indulge my selfishness...

<b>

“I understand. You may keep it, Iori-kun.”

“Eh, really?”

<b>

I was taken aback by the unexpectedly straightforward response.

<b>

“The original owner entrusted that sword to you. If you wish to keep it, I have no right to interfere.”

“Then it’s really okay for me to take it?”

“Yes. However, for the sake of avoiding various troubles, it will be under my temporary management, so please bear with that.”

<b>

I simply replied, “Understood,” and tried to summon the "Item Box."

At that moment, Kuon’s smartphone received a call.

Kuon lightly bowed her head and said, “Excuse me,” as she took out her phone and began the call.

<b>

It might take some time, so I should store this sword in the "Item Box" now.

Thinking that, I tried to activate my skill as usual, but then...

<b>

(…Huh?)

<b>

Almost simultaneously with the appearance of the Item Box, I felt a slight fatigue and drowsiness.

At first, I thought it was just my imagination, but by the time I stored the sword and tried to deactivate the Item Box, I began to feel even more dizziness and a headache.

<b>

Could it be? I opened my "Status" and, upon seeing the displayed numbers, I understood the identity of what was tormenting me.

<b>

With "Cognition Disruption," the mass creation of animals and conversion to drones through "Water Magic," "Body Enhancement" and "Skill Lending" to Kuon, "Dispel" and "Magic Counter" when sharing senses with the samurai, and finally the "Item Box."

Using this many skills, it was only natural that the consumed MP would be enormous.

And what happens when MP is nearly depleted?

<b>

“Iori-kun, I just received word from the main house that those three have been successfully restrained—”

“...Sorry. I’m going to collapse.”

“Iori-kun!?”

<b>

As I thought about how foolish I was, I lost consciousness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“You must have been fatigued. For now, rest here. And if anything happens, call for me.”

“Yes.”

<b>

As I watched the school nurse leave the spare bedroom, I listened to the voices of students preparing for the campfire outside while I stared blankly at the ceiling.

<b>

(…I woke up relatively quickly this time.)

<b>

After I collapsed, I was carried to the school nurse by the teachers and guides that Kuon called.

A little while later, I regained consciousness, underwent a check-up, and was concluded to have collapsed from fatigue and heat exhaustion, leading to me lying alone on a futon.

<b>

Still, I woke up quickly this time.

I had surely been bedridden for more than half a day during the Ushi-Oni incident.

<b>

(Was it because my level increased and I gained resistance, or have I just gotten used to this body with levels and stats?)

<b>

As I pondered this, I heard a knock on the room door.

…Did that school nurse forget something?

Thinking that, I answered drowsily, “Come in,” and tried to pull the futon over me to avoid being seen rummaging.

<b>

“Excuse me. Iori-kun, how are you feeling?”

<b>

Entering the room was Kuon, holding a chilled sports drink she must have just bought from the vending machine.

<b>

“Kuon? Aren’t you going to the campfire?”

“I can’t just casually participate after seeing you collapse like that. …Besides, the reason you collapsed is because of me.”

“No, no, that was completely my mistake.”

“Anyway! Please don’t worry about me and just let me take care of you! I have the teacher’s permission!”

“O-Okay…”

<b>

Saying that, Kuon handed me the sports drink and urged me to lie back down.

And succumbing to Kuon’s insistence, I decided to obediently follow her instructions.

<b>

“...And there’s something I’d like to ask you.”

“What do you want to ask?”

“Why did you want to help them pass on?”

<b>

Then she activated a technique said to have a fatigue recovery effect and asked me earnestly.

<b>

“There are three reasons. First, while it was just Rentaro who witnessed it this time, if I had only sealed the cursed sword and left the skeleton, it could have caused a big uproar.”

“What’s the second reason?”

“The simple solution to various problems was to take that cursed sword to the skeleton’s location.”

“...And what’s the last reason?”

“...I didn’t want to regret it later. I didn’t want to have a method to resolve things amicably and then go home feeling guilty. In other words, it was all my ego.”

<b>

Upon hearing the last reason, Kuon momentarily showed a look of astonishment, then suddenly smiled as if she understood something.

<b>

“You’re such a kind-hearted person who can’t leave those in trouble alone, Iori-kun.”

“...Isn’t it more accurate to say I’m an egoist who wants to stick my nose into everything?”

“That’s not true. At least to me, you are—”

<b>

Just then, the sound of students cheering from outside interrupted her words.

Looking out the window, it seemed that the huge campfire, the main attraction of this forest school, had been lit.

Naturally, my attention was drawn to it as well.

<b>

“Is something wrong?”

“No, it just reminded me of a sending fire. It’s still a bit early for Obon.”

“A sending fire, you say? May I ask why you thought that?”

“There’s really no significant reason. After what happened with those samurai, I just thought of it.”

<b>

Noticing something in my words, she too gazed out at the scene outside.

<b>

“I wonder if those people were able to pass on peacefully.”

“I hope so…”

<b>

As we engaged in such aimless small talk, a calm time flowed between us, contrasting with the commotion outside.

<b>

Thus, the final night of the forest school passed peacefully.

<b>

<b>

――The next day, Rentaro lamented on the return bus that he hadn’t been able to see the campfire with Kuon, but that’s another story.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

“Hey, did you hear? It seems that Kyori-sama has subdued the previously unconfirmed cursed sword!”

“As a candidate for the head of the family, to achieve such accomplishments in just six months...”

“But I hear it was actually that collaborator who subdued it?”

“No matter what, if he has such a powerful ally, the next head will be—”

<b>

In the corridor of the Kuon family’s main estate, known as the headquarters of special abilities in Japan, the elderly gathered to discuss the upcoming ritual to be held in two months, praising Kuon Kyori, one of the candidates for the next head.

<b>

“—Everyone. While it’s fine to praise Kyori-sama, please consider the time and place.”

“Y-Yes, Ibara-dono and Genji-sama...! I apologize for my rudeness...”

<b>

The expressions of the elderly changed dramatically at the appearance of the young man and woman who had suddenly appeared.

Upon seeing Genji’s face, they scattered like frightened spiders.

<b>

“Tch, those fools only think of self-preservation.”

“...Please calm down, Genji-sama.”

“How can I calm down!? They all forget that I’m the leading candidate for the next head and keep talking about Kyori, Kyori...!”

<b>

Genji shouted with genuine frustration.

To put it simply, the current situation was extremely displeasing to him.

He had pushed the troublesome administrator of that land onto Kyori, hoping for a glorious death in battle, yet Kyori had achieved overwhelming results and now unexpectedly subdued an undiscovered cursed sword.

<b>

“Rest assured, Genji-sama. We have already taken measures. You need not worry and can focus on the ritual...”

“Ah, yes. You’re right, Ibara...”

<b>

Ibara gently loosened Genji’s tightly clenched fist and, with a gentle smile, let him smell the fragrance as usual.

Then, supporting Genji, who was now unsteady on his feet, she led him to his private room.

<b>

“It’s almost time... My wish will soon be fulfilled...”

“Yes, indeed. So please take your time and rest now.”

<b>

As usual, Ibara laid Genji down on her lap and whispered in a voice so soft that no one could hear.

<b>

“Our wishes will soon come true, just a little longer.”
