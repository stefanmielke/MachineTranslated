# Episode 12: I Became a High School Student

In the middle of the night, I quietly slipped out of the window and moved lightly onto the roof.

<b>

“Ha.”

<b>

With a burst of energy, I jumped over to the roof of the neighboring house.

<b>

“Whoa, I really did it...”

<b>

I couldn't help but feel moved that I could do something like a ninja from manga or games.

Moreover, despite doing all this, I didn't feel tired at all.

<b>

I continued to leap across the roofs, moving towards the bustling downtown area in front of the station.

Then, a large building appeared before me.

<b>

“...Alright.”

<b>

I focused on the rooftop of that building and took a deep breath.

Then, I gathered my strength and jumped up vigorously.

<b>

(Ah, no way...)

<b>

I easily cleared the 3rd to 4th floors of the building, but as I approached the 8th floor, I started to lose momentum.

In a split second, I activated 'Wind Magic' to gain lift and managed to land on the rooftop.

<b>

It seemed that jumping straight to the rooftop of a ten-story building was a bit reckless.

<b>

“Status.”

<b>

Is it simply that my stats are insufficient, or am I still not accustomed to using this body?

<b>

As I pondered this, my digital watch alarm went off with a 'Bee! Bee!'

Damn, is it already that time? I wanted to try a few more things.

<b>

Feeling a bit sulky, I glanced at the colorful neon lights below and activated my skill as usual.

<b>

“Space Transfer.”

<b>

After a moment of darkness, I returned to my room.

Tomorrow is an important entrance ceremony. I should just go to bed quickly.

Thinking that, I took a quick shower, changed into my pajamas, and crawled into bed.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

“I really can’t get used to this...”

<b>

Standing in front of the mirror at the washbasin, I felt a sense of discomfort seeing myself in a blazer uniform.

For me, a uniform meant the middle school gakuran I wore just a few weeks ago.

<b>

“Hey... big brother. Are you ready?”

“Yeah, I’m ready.”

<b>

While I was thinking about that in front of the washbasin, my younger sister Kana, in the midst of her adolescence, spoke to me with an exasperated tone.

<b>

“...What?”

“It's just that it feels strange hearing you call me 'big brother'...”

“Oh really? Just hurry up and move.”

“Alright, alright. Oh, and that hairstyle looks great with that sailor uniform.”

“~~! Just hurry up!”

<b>

Kana lightly kicked my leg while covering her slightly loosened mouth with one hand, pushing me out of the washroom.

Still, I can’t believe Kana is already in the second year of middle school. Time really flies.

<b>

“Well, I’ll wait outside.”

<b>

I left the house after saying that to my sister, who was still in the washroom.

<b>

“Whoa, it’s cold...”

<b>

It should be April, but it’s still as cold as winter outside.

Still, I hesitated about wearing a scarf or gloves when Kana finally came out.

<b>

“Here.”

“Oh, a hand warmer. Thanks.”

<b>

Kana handed me a disposable hand warmer with a sulky expression.

She can be surprisingly kind, but if I mention it, she’ll get really mad.

<b>

“Well, I’m going this way.”

“Alright. Don’t accidentally head towards the elementary school.”

“Shut up.”

<b>

After parting with my sister, I started walking towards the station.

<b>

<b>

It’s been almost two years since that transfer incident, and I became a high school student.

I’ve been leveling up every day since then, but I haven’t had many situations where I had to use my skills, and my life has been relatively ordinary.

<b>

However, it seemed today was different.

<b>

“You’re the kid who messed with Yas’s brother, huh?”

<b>

On my way to the station, three scowling men appeared in front of me.

Great, more of these types.

I wish they would consider how it feels to have to deal with them.

<b>

“No, that’s not me.”

“Don’t play dumb! We know you did it!”

<b>

The men shouted angrily and brandished the metal bats and knives they were holding.

<b>

“Ugh...”

<b>

There’s no helping it. I’ll just finish this quickly.

<b>

“Gah!?”

<b>

Before they could step forward, I slipped into the space of the lead man and kicked his jaw, knocking him out.

Seeing that, the other two clearly panicked and tried to flee, but of course, I wouldn’t let them escape.

<b>

“Here we go.”

“Gyaah!?”

“Gueh!?”

<b>

I quickly caught up to the two and struck the back of their necks with my hand, knocking them out.

If I left them like this, it would lead to all sorts of trouble.

<b>

“Healing Magic, Recognition Inhibition Magic.”

<b>

It’s not normal to knock out grown men with just a hand strike.

If it were possible, it would mean that the person had suffered damage to their nerves or medulla oblongata.

So, I used 'Healing Magic' to heal their injuries and simultaneously employed my newly acquired skill, 'Recognition Inhibition Magic,' to ensure they wouldn’t remember me or anything related to me.

<b>

“Seriously, don’t make me deal with this kind of hassle on the day of the entrance ceremony.”

<b>

With that complaint, I hurriedly made my way to the station again.
