# Intermission: Those Summoned to Another World 1

<b>

<b>

"An enemy attack is coming! Those with defense skills, move to the front!"

<b>

――Deep within the underground labyrinth.

Before him stood a monster resembling a mix of a lion's face, a shaggy mammoth, and a gorilla— the 'Manticore.' The young man clad in white armor, 'Seiya Amagi,' boldly directed his comrades without hesitation.

In response, his allies activated their skills: 'Physical Attack Block' and 'Magical Attack Block.'

<b>

"Buwooooh!!"

<b>

The Manticore, enveloping its fists in ice, launched reckless attacks at Seiya and his team.

However, all of its attacks were nullified by the skills deployed under Seiya's command.

<b>

"Now! Rin, Ryouga! Attack from the side!"

"Got it!" "Right!"

<b>

In sync with Seiya's call, the ponytailed girl 'Rin Kayama,' a light warrior, and the large martial artist 'Ryouga Ouga' readied their weapons and flanked the Manticore.

Once he confirmed this, Seiya drew forth a radiant one-handed sword— the 'Holy Sword'— from the sheath on his back.

<b>

"O spirit of light, grant power to my sword! [Heavenly Holy Slash]!"

<b>

The light slash unleashed from the Holy Sword transformed into a wave of light, shattering the Manticore's massive fangs.

The impact caused the Manticore to lose its balance, staggering its enormous body.

<b>

"[Wind Fang One Flash]!"

"[Great Waterfall Break]!"

<b>

Seizing the opportunity, the other students unleashed their maximum firepower into the Manticore's side.

<b>

"Now! Charge!"

"「「「Uoooooohhh!」」」"

<b>

"Buwooooh!!"

<b>

Unable to withstand the onslaught, the Manticore finally knelt to the ground.

<b>

"Healers! Prepare to activate your skills!"

"「「Spirit of light, shine with mercy upon those rooted in the earth. [Healing Magic]!」」"

<b>

Seiya instructed the healer team, who had been standing back, to activate their healing skills to maintain the offensive.

Meanwhile, those with attack magic skills and shooting skills continuously bombarded the Manticore.

<b>

"Buwoooohhh..."

<b>

The Manticore let out a weak cry, then fell heavily onto the cold, hard ground with a loud thud.

<b>

Seiya approached the silent Manticore with utmost caution and thrust his sword forcefully into its head.

The Manticore glanced at Seiya with bulging eyes one last time but did not move again, breathing its last.

<b>

Seeing this, Seiya wiped the purple blood from the blade of the Holy Sword and raised the sword straight up to the heavens.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Then, to celebrate the defeat of the Manticore, cheers!"

"「「「Cheers!」」」"

<b>

At the behest of the class mood maker, Hatake, the students and knights raised their mugs.

The boys and the guarding knights toasted each other's bravery while drinking alcohol and juice, while the girls indulged in sweets specially prepared by the court chefs.

<b>

Watching his comrades from a distance with a mug in hand was Seiya Amagi.

<b>

"Is it alright for the main character of the party to be here?"

"Ah! Princess Priscilla!"

<b>

When Seiya turned around, he saw a beautiful girl with blonde hair dressed in a blue gown standing there.

Her name was Priscilla El Sentier, the first princess of the last remaining human nation in this world, the Sentier Kingdom, and the saint who summoned the students of classroom 2-B through the guidance of the summoning god Ashera.

<b>

"I told you to stop calling me 'Your Highness.' Just call me Priscilla."

"Right... Priscilla."

<b>

As Seiya said this shyly, Priscilla smiled happily.

<b>

"So, is the hero not going to join everyone else?"

"…I feel a bit guilty about it."

"The hero led everyone and fought splendidly. Why do you feel guilty?"

"There must have been a better way to handle today's battle. If I had done that, Sugiyama and Hinomori would..."

<b>

Sugiyama and Hinomori were students who had been injured in the earlier battle with the Manticore and were currently receiving treatment at the healing center.

<b>

"I thought you looked a bit down, and that's what you were thinking about."

"Rin..."

<b>

Rin Kayama said this with an exasperated tone and punched Seiya in the chest.

<b>

"I told you, don't shoulder everything just because you're the 'hero.'"

"…You’re right."

"And Sugiyama-kun and the others sent a message. 'Enjoy the party for us.'"

"I see. Then I'll do just that."

<b>

As Seiya smiled, Priscilla deliberately grabbed his arm.

<b>

"Then, hero, let’s go around the venue together! There are special sweets made from rare ingredients today!"

"Hey, wait! Seiya is going around the venue with me!"

"W-wait a minute, both of you..."

<b>

Pulled by Rin and Priscilla, two beautiful girls, Seiya appeared troubled verbally, but his expression seemed somewhat happy.

<b>

"Damn, showing off, huh...!"

"Having flowers in both hands, nice..."

"I want to flirt like those guys too..."

<b>

Meanwhile, some of the boys were watching Seiya and the others with envy or frustration.

<b>

"Anyway, let's level up and achieve results!"

"That's the only way to get the girls to notice us."

"Then it's decided! Let's eat as much as we can today!"

"Yeah!"

<b>

With that determination, the boys began to dig into the food laid out on the table to replenish their energy for the training starting tomorrow.

<b>

Thus, while harboring various intentions, the students summoned to this other world were enjoying their daily lives to some extent.

<b>

<b>

While forgetting their longing for the world they once lived in and the existence of the 26th classmate...
