The comic version is currently serialized in Comptiq.

"Hmm, this is the right place, right...?"

<b>

I mutter to myself while comparing the image sent by Alicia with the actual building.

What stood there was a retro-style shop remodeled from an old house. The shop's name was "Shamrock." According to online reviews, during the day it serves original blend coffee and homemade apple pastries by the owner, while at night it turns into a bar offering fruits and various alcoholic beverages sourced from different regions, making it a well-known spot that attracts customers from afar.

<b>

"Um, 'We're currently on break. Business will resume at 8 PM'..."

<b>

I check the time on my wristwatch after reading the sign hanging on the door.

The current time is 6:36 PM. I guess I have to wait about an hour and a half.

But if that's the case, it doesn't explain why Alicia sent me that message at that timing...

For now, should I just knock and if things get dicey, use 'Cognitive Disruption Magic' to manage it?

<b>

"You, the café is already closed."

<b>

While I was thinking about that, the door of the shop opened, and a dandy-looking gentleman in a white shirt and black vest, who seemed to be the owner, spoke to me.

<b>

"Ah, excuse me. Actually, I have a meeting arranged here."

"A meeting?"

"Yes, and I heard that if I tell the owner 'I came for the tea party,' it would be understood—"

<b>

When I conveyed the message Alicia had taught me, the owner's expression changed, and after looking around, he quietly said, "Come inside."

I obediently followed the owner, and just like the exterior, the interior was also retro-styled, filled with the aroma of coffee beans. However, Alicia was nowhere to be found.

<b>

"She is in the room at the very back on the second floor. Also, I apologize, but could you take this with you? It seems she hasn't eaten anything since this morning."

"Y-yes."

"And I've prepared some for you too, so if you'd like, please eat it. Now, I will return to work."

<b>

The owner said this and handed me a tray with a sandwich made of ham, lettuce, cheese, and a simple assortment of ingredients, along with a café au lait, before pointing to a door marked 'Employees Only' and starting to prepare for the evening's service.

Looking again at the tray, I noticed there were two plates with sandwiches and two cups filled with café au lait.

...I'm a bit hungry, so I'll have this sandwich later.

With that, I took the tray and headed to the room where Alicia was, knocking on the door.

<b>

"Alicia? It's Iori, I came as you said."

'...Come in.'

<b>

The voice that came from beyond the door was indeed Alicia's, but it sounded somewhat tired.

I wondered what she was doing in that room as I opened the door, revealing a peculiar space with no windows, piles of paper documents, and a corner filled with a computer screen.

<b>

"I'm sorry, but please don't read anything that's there."

"Ah, okay."

<b>

In that space, Alicia, looking haggard, was slumped over the PC.

She turned to me and glanced at the tray I was holding.

<b>

"Ah, this is from the shopkeeper because you haven't eaten anything since this morning."

"…I see, thank you. I'll eat it later, so just leave the tray somewhere."

<b>

I thought about where 'somewhere' could be as I looked around the room, and found a desk that barely had enough space for the tray, so I placed it there.

<b>

"Are you okay, Alicia? You look really tired."

"…Well, I've been staying up all night while dodging pursuers with all this paperwork. So sorry, but I’m still in this state."

"O-okay, I understand. So, what do you want me to check?"

"This."

<b>

Alicia bluntly handed me several sheets of paper. The characters written on them were not in Japanese but were filled with symbols that seemed to complicate the characters of the Voynich manuscript.

<b>

"You have the ability to discern whether objects or words are real or fake, right? I want you to check if this is genuine and if it has been altered."

<b>

… I had thought that Alicia and Kyosato would eventually find out about the existence of 'Appraisal,' but I never expected they had seen through it long ago.

<b>

"Just to let you know, I'm the only one who is aware of it. My subordinates haven't caught on yet, and I don't intend to disclose this either."

"I'll take your word for it."

<b>

Just to be safe, I used 'Appraisal' to see if Alicia was lying, and it seemed to be true.

However, I should also consider setting a trap with 'Cognitive Disruption' just in case.

<b>

Now, Alicia's request was to confirm whether this document was genuine and not altered.

Ah, right. I should prepare to use that after a long time.

<b>

('Appraisal')

<b>

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: ADXX-40019de Incident Report Copy

Condition: Good

Supplement: Document detailing a runaway incident involving an ability holder processed by a government special agency, written in special symbols.

As it is a report for the upper management, no editing or alterations have been made.

<b>

――――

<b>

"For now, it seems there have been no alterations, and it doesn't appear to be fake. However, deciphering this content is..."

"Thank you, that's enough. Here's your reward."

<b>

Alicia handed me several unusually heavy sealed paper bags.

When I opened one slightly to take a look inside...

<b>

"W-wait. How much is all this worth...?"

"10 million. That's all I could withdraw."

<b>

To say "that's all" for 10 million is something else. Just how much wealth does she possess?

Oh, right.

<b>

"Hey, today I heard from Koshimizu-sensei that you were one of his subordinates and that you escaped from the organization. Is that true?"

"Yes. I am a fugitive who betrayed the organization for my own purposes. I know they are after me, and I can feel it firsthand."

<b>

Alicia answered my question as if it were nothing.

Now that I think about it, she did mention dodging pursuers.

<b>

"Then isn't it dangerous to stay in one place?"

"I'm fine under this master. He was the best agent in our organization and is a supporter of my goals. It's easy to spread misinformation and surveillance. ...Well, even so, today is probably the limit."

<b>

Having said that, Alicia finally took a bite of the sandwich from the tray.

<b>

"Will you never return to school?"

"Yeah."

"Your friends were sad."

"That's true. But I won't have anything to do with you all from now on."

"…Are you serious?"

"Yes. You should forget about me too. You have an important girlfriend, right?"

<b>

Alicia's tone was blunt, but it didn't seem like she was just saying it casually.

She seemed to have made a significant resolution to tell me this. Then what I needed to confirm was...

<b>

"Let me ask you one last thing. Will what you're trying to do harm me, Kyosato, or my family?"

"No, and I don't intend to."

<b>

…The result of 'Appraisal' was white. No, if she is aware of my skill, she wouldn't lie.

<b>

"I understand. Then I will also avoid getting involved with you."

"Can I take that as you declining Koshimizu-sensei's request?"

"Yeah."

<b>

Alicia finished her sandwich, took a sip of café au lait, and finally looked at me with a smile.

<b>

"You really are kind, aren't you?"

"If you think so, I'm glad. Well then, take care."

<b>

I downed my café au lait in one go and left the room.

<b>

...Thus, my interaction with the girl who held the peculiar title of an agent belonging to a government special agency came to an end for the time being.
