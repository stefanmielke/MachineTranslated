# Episode 59: I Ended Up Fighting a Hero 1

A plan to infiltrate the hideout where a group of hero suits is lurking, hovering at high altitude.

It's quite simple: first, create a doll mimicking the boy who was scouted using 'Water Magic' and send it towards the promised time noted in the letter.

If the opponent sees through it, then at that time, we will slime it and restrain it on the spot. If not, we will leisurely explore the hero suits' hideout, gather information, and restrain them at the right moment.

<b>

This is the rough outline of the infiltration plan I devised.

I had backup plans prepared just in case, but at this rate, I probably won't need to use them.

<b>

"Ugh... what is your purpose!? What have you done to the boy!? What do you intend to do to me!?"

<b>

The pink hero suit—[Rose Pink Baroness] glares at us.

<b>

It would be better to leave this kind of explanation to Alicia.

Thinking that, I send her a hand signal, and Alicia, with a sigh, stands in front of the fully pink hero.

<b>

"You are suspected of being involved in a child abduction case. Do not resist foolishly and obediently follow our instructions."

"…Abduction? What are you talking about? We, the brave ones, have never engaged in such evil deeds!"

<b>

Well, I figured they would deny it. Judging by their behavior within the facility, at least this one seems to be deeply devoted to the hero, or rather the commander, and likely doesn't think they are acting abnormally at all.

<b>

"Anyway, you'll have to take off that suit."

"N-no, stop…"

<b>

Saying that, Alicia tries to remove the hero suit.

I wonder if I should not look since I can't see what's inside, and while I'm thinking that...

<b>

"—Wait. Something's coming."

"!"

<b>

The surveillance drone, which had been separated from the doll created with Water Magic and was operating independently, warned that someone was approaching this room.

<b>

"I'll transfer you to that safe house in three seconds. I'll come to get you once things are settled, so wait there until then."

"…Got it. Just don't do anything reckless."

"I'll do my best."

<b>

After that exchange, I temporarily evacuate Alicia to a safe place using 'Spatial Transfer Magic' and take a combat stance in preparation for the incoming enemy.

<b>

―――And then.

<b>

"Whoa!"

<b>

A powerful laser is fired at me, breaking through the wall and filling the room with the cold, thin air from outside.

I narrowly avoid it, generate an ice flyboard with 'Ice Magic,' and jump onto it, shifting my gaze to the opponent who launched the attack.

<b>

"Are you okay, Rose!?"

"You've deceived us well. But—"

"Don't think you can escape for free! We will go all out from the start!"

"The sin of injuring Rose will be repaid here and now!"

<b>

Four figures in hero suits appear.

Among them is the one who called himself Doctor The White, wearing a white hero suit.

<b>

"Are you ready to repent, Slime Monster!"

"No, I have no intention of doing that even a little bit."

"Then we will make you understand with our strength!"

<b>

I respond to the red hero suit's declaration, manipulating the slime that was knocked away by the laser attack and transforming it into mist.

<b>

"Tch, you think this is a distraction!? But this is meaningless!?"

<b>

In response, the green hero suit generates a gust of wind from its palm, blowing away the mist.

<b>

"You thought you could escape using this as a decoy, but that's not—"

"Escape? Who's escaping?"

"!? You bastard…"

<b>

I gather dozens of drones, which I had made smaller from those created during the school camp, and arrange them in a circular formation around me, ordering them to fire simultaneously.

<b>

"Ugh!?"

"First one down."

<b>

The high-pressure water released destroys the green hero suit's backpack and arm holster, adding more pressure to slam it down into the slime room.

<b>

"How dare you hurt Fuma…! [Thunder Dragon Barrage]!"

<b>

Now, the yellow hero suit wraps its arms in lightning and charges at me like a flash.

<b>

(Defense formation)

"Tch…"

<b>

As I think this, the drones change their shape, deploying multiple triangular water barriers to completely block the yellow hero suit's attack.

<b>

(Slime transformation)

"Ah!? Wh-what is this!? What is happening!?"

<b>

Next, I transform the water barrier into slime to restrain its movements.

<b>

"That's two down."

"How could you, how could you hurt my precious friend!"

<b>

Seeing this, Doctor The White unleashes a barrage of attacks from multiple angles, using a syringe-type beam rifle and throwing scalpels with his sub-arms while blasting his jetpack.

<b>

(It's a hassle to dodge each one. Then)

<b>

I activate 'Body Enhancement (Medium)' and kick the flyboard hard, charging toward Doctor The White.

<b>

"What!?"

<b>

Doctor The White is flustered by the unexpected charge but quickly activates his jetpack to attempt an evasive maneuver.

<b>

(I won't let you escape)

<b>

The target is small, but it's definitely not impossible to hit.

I use what he threw as a foothold to accelerate even further—.

<b>

"Ugh!?"

"Three down."

<b>

Grabbing Doctor The White's helmet, I throw him with force into the room covered in slime.

<b>

Now then.

<b>

"You're the only one left. What will you do?"

"Tch… if it has come to this…"

<b>

The red hero suit operates something with its holster, drawing a toy-like sword from its sheath and getting into position.

<b>

"You don't intend to surrender, huh."

"Defeat is not permitted for a hero. Therefore, I will defeat you with all my strength!"

<b>

As the red hero suit shouts this, a giant mech resembling a Tyrannosaurus, which I saw in the hangar below, slowly rises.

<b>

Then the red hero suit turns into a red light and dives into the eyes of the Tyrannosaurus-shaped mech.

<b>

"Kneel before this [God Tyranno]!"

"Roaaar!!!"

<b>

The Tyrannosaurus-shaped mech, or [God Tyranno], sprouts massive wings from its back and lets out a heavy roar.

<b>

"Whoa!"

<b>

I jump onto the newly generated flyboard and mutter as I look at the mechanical eyes of this God Tyranno, which seems to have merged with the red hero suit.

<b>

"Didn't you know? Growing large is usually a sign of losing."
