# Episode 116: Long-cherished Wish

「……」

<b>

I access the database as usual using the dedicated terminal provided by the organization.

I have long known that this terminal, as well as all safety houses, are equipped with surveillance devices.

That’s why I have made it a habit to check all the records in the database to deceive those watching me through the devices.

<b>

(ADXX-40019de handling case, this one)

<b>

A post-incident report on the incident of an ability user’s power explosion that occurred ten years ago.

The reason I joined this organization and continued to work as an agent.

The meaning behind my compliance with any unreasonable orders from above.

All of it is to read this report and understand what happened on that day, at that time.

<b>

(I’m feeding false information to the surveillance devices. It will take them about 30 minutes to realize what I’m doing)

<b>

As I scroll through the terminal screen and read the contents of the report, I simultaneously copy this data to a USB memory.

<b>

Now, I have no reason to remain in this organization.

Then I should make my exit quickly.

<b>

(Goodbye, Osamu, Kyori)

<b>

I silently bid farewell in my heart and quietly left the safe house.

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

"Hey, Alicia isn't here today."

<b>

Two weeks after the cultural festival incident, while I was having a silly chat with my male friends as usual, Rentaro noticed that Alicia had not yet arrived at school.

It was just about time for morning HR, but it was unusual for Alicia, who had never been late even once, to not show up.

Could it be that the organization had given her some work?

<b>

"Everyone, please take your seats. We will begin HR now."

<b>

As I pondered this, Koshimizu-sensei entered the classroom and urged the students to return to their seats.

The teacher took the attendance sheet and lightly discussed some announcements.

<b>

"As I mentioned beforehand, today’s LHR will include an orientation for next week’s social studies field trip, so please prepare the materials distributed earlier. Also..."

"?"

<b>

Koshimizu-sensei briefly glanced at my face but quickly directed her gaze to the entire class.

<b>

"Alicia has transferred schools due to family circumstances. Please consider this when planning your group activities for the field trip. That concludes this morning’s LHR."

<b>

Koshimizu-sensei said this in a flat tone and then left the classroom again.

However, the class was unable to hide their shock at Alicia’s sudden transfer.

And it was the same for me and Kyori.

<b>

(Alicia transferred? Did she have to do that due to the organization’s orders? But considering the mission assigned to her—)

<b>

I tried to think of various reasons, but none of them resonated.

<b>

"Osamu-kun, the first period class is a moving classroom."

"Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Kyori."

<b>

Finally brought back to reality by Kyori’s words, I prepared for class and headed towards the audiovisual room with her.

Then, at that moment.

<b>

"Kuon-san, may I have a moment?"

<b>

I thought Koshimizu-sensei had already gone to the staff room, but she suddenly spoke to Kyori.

<b>

"Yes. What is it?"

"Could you come to the club room after school today? I have something important to discuss."

"Understood. Should I inform Ikoma-senpai as well?"

"No, please do not mention this to Ikoma-san. And—"

<b>

Koshimizu-sensei looked at me with a somewhat apologetic expression and continued.

<b>

"Please come to the club room as well, Iori-san. This is a matter that is difficult to discuss openly."

"…I’m not a member of the literary club, you know?"

"Yes. Even so."

<b>

Confused by the increasingly unclear words, the teacher apologized for having held us back and walked toward the staff room.

<b>

"…What does this mean?"

"Who knows…?"

<b>

As the mystery deepened, we hurried to the audiovisual room as the time for the first period approached.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

And after school, when Kyori and I headed to the literary club room, Koshimizu-sensei was already waiting.

<b>

"Um, sensei, the reason you called us…"

"First, let me confirm. Did you meet with Alicia last night?"

<b>

I tilted my head at Koshimizu-sensei’s words.

Why is she asking us if we met with Alicia, who is supposedly transferred?

<b>

"No, we didn’t meet…"

"I didn’t meet her either."

"Are you really sure you didn’t meet her? Is there any sense of discomfort in your memory of not meeting her?"

<b>

I was puzzled by the strange question, but regardless, it remained unchanged that we hadn’t met Alicia.

Moreover, drones that negate recognition interference are constantly deployed around my home, so memory alteration should not be possible.

Thus, the fact that I hadn’t met Alicia remains unchanged.

<b>

"I have no discomfort in my memory, and I haven’t met her since yesterday’s HR."

"---I see."

<b>

With a slightly stronger tone, Koshimizu-sensei muttered with a look of relief.

Then, her expression tightened, and she bowed deeply to us.

<b>

"I sincerely apologize for suspecting you. You may think it rude of me to act this way after such a non-issue, but could you please listen to our story?"

"Uh, um…?"

"Koshimizu-sensei…?"

<b>

As Kyori and I were surprised by Koshimizu-sensei’s sudden change, she continued speaking while still bowing her head.

<b>

"I am an agent of the same organization as Alicia, or more precisely, I was lurking in this school as her subordinate. And Alicia escaped last night with classified data from the organization. I understand well the capabilities of Iori-san and Kuon-san. Please help us capture Alicia before she comes into contact with those who would harm this country."
