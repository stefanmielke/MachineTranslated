# Chapter 71: Invited to the Mansion 4

"It's just ridiculous to take away the precious after-school time of high school students in the prime of their youth."

"Yeah..."

"I wish our school would hire a cleaning service too."

"Yeah..."

<b>

As I swept the floor, I tuned out Rentaro's complaints.

It's been a week since the second semester started, and there had been almost no progress at all.

I still hadn't received a reply from Kuon, and Alicia, whether she had something to do or not, left the classroom immediately after homeroom on cleaning duty days, so I hadn't been able to consult her about the letter.

I really needed to decide soon whether to go or not.

<b>

"Hey, Shu, are you listening?"

"Hm? Oh, yeah, I'm listening. You were saying our school should get robot vacuums, right?"

"Not quite... So what's up? You've been spaced out all day. Did a girl reject you?"

"Of course not. I was just thinking about finishing the cleaning quickly so I could go home and take a nap."

"Oh, I see."

<b>

Noticing my lackluster attitude, Rentaro seemed to realize that continuing the conversation wouldn't yield anything interesting, and he started cleaning seriously.

<b>

Should I send a message just in case?

As I swept the floor while pondering this.

<b>

"Oops."

<b>

My smartphone, which I had shoved into my pocket, started vibrating.

I wondered if Kana had sent a request for dinner tonight, and as I leaned the broom against the wall and opened my phone.

<b>

'Alicia: I have something I want to confirm regarding the letter. Is it okay if I call you tonight?'

<b>

Receiving an unexpected message from an unexpected person made me grip my smartphone a little tighter.

<b>

"What? Who's contacting you?"

"…It's from my sister. She's reminding me not to forget my chores."

"Oh, your sister, huh... Hey, Shu. If it's okay, can I—"

"I'm definitely not introducing you to her."

<b>

While I casually brushed off Rentaro, I checked the newly arrived message again.

<b>

'I have something I want to confirm regarding the letter.'

<b>

Alicia, and by extension the organization she belongs to, must be monitoring me constantly, so they would obviously know that I received a letter from that shikigami.

What I'm curious about is why she sent this message at this timing.

<b>

"Hey boys, make sure to clean properly!"

"Yeah, yeah, I got it."

<b>

As I stared at my smartphone, Rentaro teased me.

In any case, she said she wanted to call. I would ask my questions then.

<b>

I replied, 'Around 9 PM is fine,' and immediately got a response saying, 'Then let's do it at that time.'

After confirming that, I put my smartphone back in my pocket and resumed cleaning.

<b>

"Hey, Shu. At least give me her ID—"

"I'm definitely not introducing you to her."

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Phew..."

<b>

It was 9 PM.

Having finished my assignment due tomorrow, I closed my notebook and stretched widely when my smartphone started ringing.

I picked up the device and checked the screen, and there was Alicia's name.

<b>

Just to be safe, I used 'Recognition Disruption Magic' to ensure the conversation wouldn't leak outside, then pressed the call button.

<b>

"Hello?"

"I'm sorry for calling so late. Is this a good time?"

"Yeah, it's fine. So, what did you want to confirm?"

"Did you receive a letter from someone on the day of the opening ceremony?"

<b>

Wow, she's coming straight to the point with her question.

<b>

"Ah... I did receive one. But you guys have been monitoring me the whole time, right? Was there really a need to confirm it?"

"…I'm sorry, let's hold off on the questions for now. Did you see the letter?"

"Uh? Yeah, I saw it, but..."

"Did you feel any discomfort? Like feeling lethargic or unable to sleep, or feeling like you had to do something even if you didn't want to—"

"No, not really..."

<b>

As I calmly answered her series of questions, which seemed to convey a sense of urgency and panic, she let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"…I'm glad. It seems like nothing has happened so far."

"What's wrong? You seem unusually anxious."

"I have every right to be anxious. You met with the Kuon family's shikigami and even saw the letter it had, right? Such prestigious families have curses that can drive people insane just by making eye contact, so it's strictly forbidden to make contact carelessly."

<b>

Scary! Does such a thing really exist in reality?

In the end, nothing happened, but in the worst-case scenario, either I or Kana could have been in danger...

…No, wait.

<b>

"Then you should have contacted me that day. If you had done that, at least I wouldn't have seen the letter."

<b>

If they were monitoring me, then Alicia could have avoided such anxiety if she had contacted me that day, and the chances of me or Kana encountering danger would have been lower.

<b>

<b>

"…You're right. If I had communicated sooner, I could have prevented unnecessary anxiety. I'm really sorry."

<b>

Alicia's words struck a chord with me.

—If I had communicated sooner. What that implies is...

<b>

"Could it be that you didn't contact me because you couldn't?"

"…It's embarrassing to admit, but yes. Until we were pointed out by the organization's exorcist, we were led to believe that the shikigami was just an ordinary human with no abnormalities. That's why it took us so long to get in touch."

<b>

So that's why the communication was delayed until today.

…Wait a minute?

<b>

"Even though it was wearing a conspicuous black kimono in the summer, no one thought it was strange? My sister was so scared she wouldn't even come near the house."

"A kimono? In the footage, it looked like a casually dressed guy around your age."

"Uh?"

"…That's how it is. That shikigami had a technique that changed its appearance depending on who was looking at it."

<b>

Ah... Now that I think about it, I remember something about it having an information concealment ability written in the 'Appraisal.'

That's why Alicia and the others couldn't notice anything strange.

<b>

…No, discussing shikigami and curses when we're amateurs won't yield any answers.

For now, I should...

<b>

"While we're at it, I have something I want to confirm too, is that okay?"

"If I can answer, then sure."

"The letter I received mentioned inviting me to the Kuon family's main residence during the long weekend next week. What do you think about that?"

"…Who is the sender?"

<b>

Since she asked, I took the letter out of my desk drawer and checked the sender.

<b>

"It says Kuon Sougen."

"Thank you. …Personally, I think it's better to forget the contents of the letter. You're almost certainly going to get involved in some troublesome matters."

"Troublesome matters?"

<b>

When I asked back, Alicia hesitated for a moment before answering.

However, deciding that it was better to answer honestly rather than hide or deceive, she seemed to gather her resolve and said:

<b>

"The Kuon family is currently conducting a 'Selection Ceremony' to determine the next head of the family."
