# Chapter 113: The Cultural Festival Has Begun 5

――In a daze, I dream.

Old, old memories. Traumas I wanted to forget.

<b>

"Why can't you do it like me!? You're my daughter, right!?"

<b>

――Shut up. I'm not your mother.

<b>

"Sorry, Ikoma-san. We have family matters, so could you switch duties with us?"

<b>

――Liar. I know you just want to offload your troubles and go have fun.

<b>

"…Ikoma? She's just a errand girl, right? Oh, don't say this. If she finds out, she'll probably sulk."

<b>

――As I thought. If that's the case, you could have just told me directly instead of gossiping behind my back.

<b>

"Hey, ghost girl! Your dad abandoned you, huh!"

"You're so creepy! Hide that face!"

"Wow, you're crying. How pathetic."

<b>

――Shut up. I know that better than anyone.

<b>

But what I can't forgive the most is that even after all this, I can only smile wryly and cower, a weak and ugly version of myself who can only escape into delusions...

<b>

"I shall relieve your anger."

<b>

At that moment, I saw the jade-colored crystal being stained with a sinister hue.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Haah!"

"Gi...gigi...Yoro...shiku..."

<b>

After delivering a powerful punch to the remaining one in the pit of its stomach, I looked around.

I could no longer sense any enemy presence. If that's the case, there's no need to linger here any longer.

<b>

"Kyori, are you okay?"

"Y-yes, I'm fine."

"…Understood. Then let's proceed deeper."

<b>

After confirming Kyori's condition, I activated 'Healing Magic' for both of us just in case, then walked toward the depths of the otherworldly space while deploying reconnaissance drones and shikigami.

After a while, we reached the edge of this otherworldly space—and witnessed something that shouldn't exist in a classroom.

<b>

"Is this... a staircase?"

"Seems so. Now, where does it lead?"

<b>

I directed the drone's spotlight toward the stone staircase extending toward the bottom of a massive sinkhole, but the light could only illuminate about ten centimeters ahead.

Next, I tried sending a reconnaissance drone with 'Water Magic,' but it showed no response after descending a dozen meters.

…Since there are no other paths, it seems we have no choice but to descend this staircase directly.

<b>

"We need to see what's at the bottom. Are you okay?"

"I'm fine. …Let's go."

<b>

We held hands to avoid getting lost in the darkness and carefully descended the staircase illuminated by the drone's spotlight, step by step.

<b>

"…What do you think caused this otherworldly space, Shu-kun?"

<b>

I wondered how much time had passed.

I felt no physical fatigue, but descending endlessly into the pitch-blackness was mentally exhausting, and suddenly Kyori asked that question.

<b>

"I think it's due to Ikoma-senpai's ability going out of control, but I don't understand why it happened at this timing."

"And what do you mean by that?"

"…Senpai has been unreachable for the past two days, right? If her ability went out of control, it should have happened around that time."

"That means… do you think Ikoma-senpai was desperately trying to suppress her ability but reached her limit?"

"If that were possible, she could have prevented some of the previous outbursts of her ability, right? It seems to me that there is some intent behind this ability going out of control."

<b>

――Well, in the end, I won't understand anything unless I see what lies at the bottom of this big hole.

I added that as a final thought and paused the conversation, but my mind couldn't stop thinking about why this situation had occurred.

The fact that a large number of people who treated Ikoma-senpai maliciously gathered at the timing of the cultural festival and activated such an abnormal phenomenon with the "ability to turn delusions into reality" can only be seen as revenge. If that's possible, it means that senpai had the power to control her ability or had learned it.

It's hard to believe that she could control it but was hiding that fact.

If that were the case, she should have been able to use her ability more skillfully, like ensuring she wasn't treated maliciously.

So, has she recently acquired the ability to control it? That also feels uncertain.

<b>

(Then, could it be that a third party with special abilities, as Alicia mentioned before, was turning Ikoma-senpai's delusions into reality?)

<b>

As I pondered this, the spotlight mounted on the drone began to illuminate not the staircase but the stone-paved floor.

…It seems we've reached the very bottom of this sinkhole.

<b>

"Kyori, prepare for combat just in case...!?"

<b>

As I urged the warning and tried to direct the drone's spotlight forward, the surrounding space suddenly began to glow intensely.

In response, I immediately generated countless ice spears in the air, turned off the drone's spotlight, and what was there was...

<b>

"This is... a room in an apartment?"

"I think so, but this is..."

<b>

What spread out before us was a room in an apartment where parts of the ceiling and floor had collapsed—likely the entrance—and through the gap, the same thick fog that had covered the school building was visible.

The lighting was sparse, but there was enough illumination to ensure some visibility even without the drone's spotlight.

<b>

"We don't know when or where we'll be ambushed. Let's proceed with caution."

"Yes."

<b>

So we cautiously opened the doors on either side of the hallway leading to what seemed to be the living room.

One was a storage room, and the other was a bathroom, with nothing particularly attention-grabbing.

After the reconnaissance, I generated a slime with 'Water Magic' just in case an enemy appeared later and sealed each door to prevent ambush.

I don't know how effective this will be, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

<b>

(The problem is what comes next...)

<b>

I carefully opened the door, ready to use the drone as a shield at any moment.

As expected, the area beyond the door was the living room, and the extent of the destruction was far worse than that of the entrance.

Potted plants were withered, calendars were torn, dressers were toppled, the sofa was in disarray with its stuffing spilling out, and the television was literally shattered to pieces.

The only things that could be said to retain their shape were the window glass of the balcony, which was covered in thick fog and not reflecting the outside scenery, and the glass table in the center of the living room.

On that glass table, papers were scattered.

<b>

"…………"

<b>

I activated 'Dispel' on the papers and picked one up.

The paper was filled with words like "Why?", "I don't want to," "I want to stop," and "I want to escape."

<b>

(‘Appraisal’)

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Paper torn from a university notebook

Effect: Causes confusion in the consciousness of those who read the words written on the paper.

Status: Inactive due to 'Dispel.'

Supplement: The effect is granted by the Ikai Crystal【Curse】. The words are transcriptions of Ikoma Juri's thoughts.

<b>

――――

<b>

I couldn't help but widen my eyes at the displayed 'Appraisal' result.

Ikai Crystal. That unidentified item recovered during the Hero Suit incident.

Is that involved in this incident?

<b>

"?!"

<b>

As I contemplated this, the balcony window suddenly cracked, and half of the living room literally blew away.

Then, the surrounding thick fog was rapidly swept away by a tremendous gust of wind.

<b>

"…What the hell is this?"

<b>

As the mist cleared and visibility became clearer, what was on the other side of the balcony window was revealed.

<b>

A massive jade-colored crystal, covered in countless root-like tendrils, radiating a distinctly sinister aura.

And at its center was―――.

<b>

"Ikoma-senpai!"

<b>

As that came into view, Kyori let out a scream.

――In the center of the crystal was Ikoma-senpai, floating in a fetal position with her eyes closed.

<b>

"…aaaaAAAAAAAA!!"

<b>

When the gaze of Ikoma-senpai, trapped inside the crystal, turned toward us, the crystal vibrated violently, emitting a high-pitched sound, and summoned the giant doll-like monster and the black humanoid entity we first encountered in this otherworldly space, manipulating them like marionettes.

<b>

(‘Appraisal’)

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Ikai Crystal【Curse】

Effect: Grants the creator the ability to read the thoughts of the person directly possessing it, and allows the holder to activate skills remotely around them.

Additionally, by using a certain number of remote skill activations, the crystal itself can gain self-defense capabilities, and the holder's ego can be controlled.

Supplement: Extracts magical power from another world and covers the MP needed for the holder's skill activation.

If the crystal is lost, the link between the creator and the holder is severed, and all skills that were originally activated lose their effectiveness.

Status: Good. Currently sealing Ikoma Juri within the crystal.

The current holder is 【Not Viewable】.

<b>

<b>

――――

<b>

I see. The root cause of this abnormal phenomenon is that crystal.

<b>

"Kyori! That crystal is the root cause! If we destroy it, this abnormal phenomenon will cease!"

"…That is the root cause. What should I do?"

"Provide support like before!"

"Y-yes, understood!"

<b>

――Alright, this is probably the final battle in this abnormal space.

I steeled myself again and ran toward the massive crystal.
