# Chapter 4: Skill Testing Begins 1

"Shuu, are you awake?"

<b>

I wake up to the sound of my father's voice coming from beyond the door.

Looking out the window, I see bright sunlight streaming in through the gap in the curtains.

I should have returned home yesterday evening after using 'Spatial Transfer Magic'.

So this means... 

<b>

"Shuu?"

"Ah, yeah! I'm awake."

"You slept all day yesterday, but are you feeling okay?"

"…Yeah, probably okay."

"Got it. Well then, I'm off to work, so don't push yourself too hard."

"Roger that."

<b>

As I respond, I hear my father descending the stairs.

No matter how much my level increases, I need to ensure a safety margin, or I might faint again like yesterday.

<b>

"Oh, I forgot."

<b>

I peek into the trash can placed in the corner of the room.

There, without a doubt, is the empty plastic bottle I transferred yesterday.

<b>

Wow, my level has jumped to 13 all at once.

For now, I can consider that I've made progress in leveling up.

That means the next issue is...

<b>

"Grumble"

<b>

Just as I think that, my stomach lets out a cry.

...Come to think of it, I haven't eaten anything since last night.

There's no helping it. I'll think about it after having breakfast.

<b>

With that in mind, I leave my room...

<b>

"Oh."

"Ah."

<b>

I run into my younger sister Kana, who was just about to enter the room next door at the same time.

<b>

"G-Good morning, Kana."

"…Good morning."

<b>

As I greet her, Kana enters the room with a somewhat sulky expression and slams the door shut with a "bang!"

It's no wonder she's upset; I've caused her a lot of trouble while I was hospitalized.

<b>

Feeling a bit down, I head towards the living room when I notice the bathroom door left ajar.

I assume either my father or Kana forgot to close it, so I reach for the door to close it when suddenly a thought crosses my mind.

<b>

The bathroom connected to the washroom; I could fully test the skill 'Water Magic' I learned yesterday there.

Thinking that, I quickly take off my socks and step into the bathroom.

But first, I should check something.

<b>

"Appraisal"

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Skill 'Water Magic'

Effect: Generates water using magical power

Status: Skill Level 1/10

Notes:

<b>

―――

<b>

The displayed information is quite vague.

I won't know the details until I actually use it.

<b>

"…'Water Magic'"

<b>

I activate the skill in a quiet voice so that Kana on the second floor can't hear me.

Then, a small water sphere appears in my palm, and from it, a thin stream of water shoots out towards the bathtub in a parabolic arc.

<b>

...It's saltier than I expected.

<b>

The MP consumption is only 5, which is quite low. Or rather, considering how weak it is, is it actually high?

I thought it would be a useful skill when I learned it, but maybe it was a mistake. I expected something more like a powerful jet of water.

As I think that...

<b>

"Whoa!?"

<b>

Suddenly, the water sphere grows to about my body size, and the amount of water being released increases dramatically.

It looks exactly like what I had imagined. At the same time, I start to feel fatigue and a sense of lethargy.

<b>

In a panic, I stop the activation of Water Magic, and the water sphere bursts with a loud "splash."

Ignoring that sight, I check my 'Status' again.

<b>

Earlier, I only consumed 5 MP, but now I've lost nearly 50 in one go.

<b>

"…'Water Magic'"

<b>

I visualize the first activation and activate Water Magic again.

Then, I check my status once more...

<b>

This time, my MP has only decreased by 5.

…What does this mean?

<b>

"Hey."

"What!?"

<b>

As I ponder this, I'm suddenly addressed by a voice.

Turning around, I see Kana standing there, looking exasperated.

<b>

"I heard a loud noise. What were you doing?"

"Ah, I was half-asleep and taking a shower..."

"…You didn't hurt yourself or anything, right?"

"Ah, of course not."

"…Well, that's good to hear."

<b>

After saying that, Kana leaves.

I wonder if she’s genuinely worried about me?

<b>

Oh, I forgot. I was on my way to have breakfast.

<b>

Putting the skills aside for now, I head towards the kitchen again.
