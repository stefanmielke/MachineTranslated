# Episode 117: A Classmate Has Escaped

"Um, could you wait a moment? I need to organize my thoughts..."

"It's understandable to feel that way when suddenly confronted with such information. Please take your time to think it over."

<b>

Feeling like my head was about to explode from the sudden flood of information, I sought permission from Koshimizu-sensei and began to ponder on the spot.

First, our homeroom teacher was an agent of Alicia's organization. Furthermore, it seemed that student Alicia was the teacher's superior.

At this point, it was already incomprehensible, but what complicated matters further was that Alicia had absconded with classified data.

And Koshimizu-sensei was asking me to capture Alicia...

<b>

"I have a few questions, if that's alright?"

<b>

As I was deep in thought, Kyori raised her hand to ask Koshimizu-sensei a question.

<b>

"Yes, that's fine."

"Since when has the teacher been an agent of the organization that Alicia belongs to?"

"I can't disclose the exact timing, but by the time you two enrolled, I was already an agent of the organization... tasked with observing your movements."

<b>

So, that means we were under surveillance by Koshimizu-sensei from the very beginning.

...I feel a mix of confusion and unease, but for now, I'll set that aside. Just in case, I'll activate 'Identification'.

<b>

"Then, when did Alicia become an agent?"

"I've been informed that it was from the age of six. Apparently, her brother's ability awakening was the catalyst for her involvement with our organization, and she subsequently became an agent."

<b>

In other words, Alicia has been a seasoned agent doing this dangerous job for nearly ten years.

Is that the reason why she has treated people clearly older than her like subordinates?

<b>

"Lastly, if we capture Alicia, what will happen to her?"

<b>

Next, Kyori posed that question, and Koshimizu-sensei's expression momentarily showed a hint of panic, but she quickly returned to her poker face and spoke.

<b>

"Alicia will be returned to the training facility and will serve as a rear support personnel. You likely won't see her again."

"I see... Shu-kun, what will you do—"

"Koshimizu-sensei, I'm sorry. Could you please wait a moment for my response? It's all too sudden, and I can't organize my thoughts yet."

<b>

I interrupted Kyori's words with my reply.

Hearing that, Koshimizu-sensei sighed in disappointment and simply murmured, "Understood."

At that moment, the school bell signaling the end of classes rang throughout the building.

<b>

"If possible, please let me know your answer by the end of this week. Well then."

<b>

Koshimizu-sensei stood up, bowed elegantly to us, and exited the literature club room.

Once I confirmed that she had completely left the building through the 'sense-sharing' with the drones deployed around the school, I then activated 'Recognition Disruption Magic' to prevent eavesdropping.

<b>

"Um, Shu-kun—"

"Alicia is trying to make contact with someone harmful to this country," "She'll be returned to the training facility and serve as rear support personnel." This is a blatant lie. It seems that Alicia's organization intends to capture and kill her because she knows something inconvenient for the higher-ups."

"Are you serious about the killing part!?"

"Yeah. That's why I didn't want to respond back there."

<b>

As a result of using 'Identification' on Koshimizu-sensei's conversation, the only truths were that she was once Alicia's superior and that she needed our cooperation.

It seems there are several pieces of information that Koshimizu-sensei is unaware of, but in any case, I can't take her words at face value.

<b>

"So what do you plan to do, Shu-kun?"

"I'm planning to decline by saying something like 'I don't know what Alicia might do.' They seem to be hiding something and don't appear to be fully informed, so getting involved seems like it would only lead to trouble."

"I see... Then I'll do the same."

<b>

After hearing my response, Kyori made up her mind and nodded.

<b>

"Oh, by the way. It seems Alicia's organization is always monitoring the electronic devices we use. It might be a hassle, but please send important messages through shikigami."

"Understood. ...It seems we might get in trouble if we stay in the school building any longer, so shall we head back?"

"Yeah. Just to be safe, I'll walk you to the station."

<b>

I released my skill and took Kyori's hand as we left the school together.

As we walked, we engaged in light conversation about our next date plans to dispel our anxiety until we reached the station, where we parted ways. I was about to head straight home when—

<b>

"Oh?"

<b>

My phone suddenly vibrated, and when I opened it, I saw a notification indicating that I had received a message.

And the sender was...

<b>

(Alicia...!?)

<b>

According to Koshimizu-sensei, she should have been missing after escaping the organization, so I froze at the sudden message from her.

<b>

"......"

<b>

Feeling suspicious but knowing that nothing would start without checking the contents, I activated 'Magic Counter' and 'Identification' just in case, then tapped the screen.

<b>

"I'm sorry for the sudden contact. To get straight to the point, can we meet alone tonight? There's something I absolutely need to confirm with you. Of course, I have a reward prepared."

<b>

The message from Alicia was just that.

...Now, regarding my response to this message.

<b>

"I heard various things from the teacher, but is it really okay to meet? Isn't this conversation being monitored as well?"

"It's fine just for today. But after tomorrow, I won't be able to send messages. Please, I really want you to hear me out."

<b>

The result of 'Identification' that I was looking at on my phone screen was... white. There was no doubt that this message was sent by Alicia herself, and it seemed she genuinely wanted to convey something to me.

<b>

"Even if we agree to meet, where will it be? This town is full of surveillance, right?"

<b>

After sending that message, I received a link to a privately owned café and bar in the city.

<b>

"Tell the owner that you came for a 'tea party.' That way, we can talk without being monitored."

<b>

Hmm, according to 'Identification,' this message is also white. So it seems we can indeed talk alone without being watched.

<b>

(...Well, it seems I just need to confirm a few things, so I might as well go.)

<b>

With that thought, I quickly sent a message to Kana saying, "I'll be home late," and headed towards the bar in question.
