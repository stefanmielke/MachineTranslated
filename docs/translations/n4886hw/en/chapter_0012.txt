# Episode 11: I Ended Up Helping Someone 4

"Good morning, Iori-kun."

"Hey, Fujisawa-san."

<b>

One weekend morning, we reunited at the usual supermarket's bicycle parking lot.

Fujisawa-san wasn't wearing an apron; she was dressed in a boa jacket and long pants, suitable for going out.

And she was carrying a long, stick-like object wrapped in cloth on her back.

<b>

"It's been a really long time since we met like this."

"Well, a lot has happened since then."

<b>

Fujisawa-san's face, speaking nostalgically, looked remarkably healthier than when we last met.

If Kana were to say it, she would probably say, "Fujisawa-senpai is back to her usual energetic self."

<b>

<b>

After that, Kajiwara and the others were arrested by the police, who had been notified in advance.

As a result, the abuse and violence that Fujisawa-san had suffered were brought to light.

<b>

However, at the same time, a new problem arose.

That was what to do with Fujisawa-san and her younger brothers.

Among those arrested in this incident was Fujisawa-san's mother.

This meant that only her father could raise Fujisawa-san and her brothers, but her father had been living away from home for months, only sending money for living expenses.

Could such a person truly raise children properly?

The child consultation center thought so, and was considering placing Fujisawa-san and her brothers in a children's care facility if necessary.

<b>

"By the way, how are your younger brothers doing?"

"They're doing well at my grandparents' place. Look."

<b>

On the smartphone screen that Fujisawa-san showed me, her younger brothers were happily playing, watched warmly by an elderly couple.

<b>

The first to voice their concerns upon learning about the situation Fujisawa-san and her brothers were in were her paternal grandparents, who lived far away and had been worried about the lack of contact.

Fujisawa-san's grandparents seemed to be genuinely good people, making one wonder if they were really the parents of that father, and they were raising the children properly.

<b>

"But is it really okay? To come back here?"

"…Yeah. No matter what, I have feelings for that house, and I want to be there for the graduation ceremony with everyone."

<b>

That's right, Fujisawa-san didn't go to her grandparents.

Of course, it seems her grandparents strongly opposed it, but she must have desperately continued to persuade them until she got permission to keep living in that house.

Honestly, I think Fujisawa-san would be better off living with her grandparents, but if she wants to do it this way, then that's fine.

<b>

"By the way, I've heard that those people are saying strange things during the interrogation. Something about being attacked by a monster."

"Ah…"

<b>

According to what I've heard, Kajiwara and the others are claiming things like, "We were attacked by a monster" and "We have to escape quickly or we'll be killed."

Also, Fujisawa-san's mother is reportedly saying, "Suddenly, the living room door was frozen."

The police, noting that they were in an extreme state of intoxication at the time, seem to be attributing it to them seeing hallucinations due to alcohol, but as someone who knows the truth, I'm at a loss as to how to respond.

<b>

That day, I burst into Fujisawa-san's house using "Spatial Transfer Magic" and first froze the living room door with "Ice Magic" to prevent her mother from barging in.

After that, I helped Fujisawa-san and her brothers escape and knocked out Kajiwara and the others, then I escaped through the window and returned to my room as if nothing had happened.

And although Fujisawa-san's house is a distance that would take a normal person at least 30 minutes to run one way, everything was over in just a little over ten minutes.

<b>

It seems that when Kajiwara was taken to the interrogation room, he remembered me and said, "Iori Shu is a monster!" but because of this, the detectives seem to be ignoring him completely.

<b>

"Senpai!"

<b>

As we were chatting like that, I heard Kana's voice from a distance.

<b>

"You're late, Kana."

"Big brother, you're noisy. More importantly, it's been a while, Fujisawa-senpai!"

"Yeah. It's been a while, Kana-chan. I'm glad to see you're doing well."

"Yes! Thanks to senpai coming back, I'm super energetic!"

<b>

On Kana's back was a long stick covered in the same cloth as the one Fujisawa-san was carrying—a bamboo sword.

That's right, today is the day Fujisawa-san returns to the dojo after several months.

<b>

"Well then, big brother, make sure to hang the laundry properly."

"Okay, okay, I got it."

"Alright, let's go! Fujisawa-senpai!"

"Ah, wait a moment."

<b>

Fujisawa-san suddenly turned back toward us.

I wondered if she had forgotten something. As I was thinking that.

<b>

"…Really, really thank you. Iori-kun."

<b>

Fujisawa-san whispered softly.

And then――。

<b>

<b>

"Well then, see you next week."

"Y-yeah."

<b>

With that, Fujisawa-san blushed a little and ran off to join Kana.

<b>

"Well then, shall I head home?"

<b>

Feeling slightly flustered by the unexpected turn of events, I went home.
