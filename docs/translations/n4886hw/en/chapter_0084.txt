# Episode 80: Invited to the Mansion 8

"Did you know I managed to create this all by myself without that old bastard and old hag noticing? How amazing is that?"

<b>

Saying this, Koharu approached me like a dog bringing back a ball, eager for praise from its owner.

I don't have much knowledge about these things, but it must be quite impressive to have prepared a hidden passage all by herself while outsmarting those guys.

<b>

"So, what's next? Are we just going to take Kuon directly and slip away through this hidden passage?"

"If only it were that easy."

<b>

With that, Koharu opened the door to the hidden passage just a crack.

What I could see beyond was the hallway of the Kuon family’s main residence.

<b>

"Kyōri is locked up in a completely sealed room with no connections to anywhere. Only those old bastards know where she is."

"Then how are we supposed to get Kuon out?"

"The head of the Kuon family is chosen through the 'Selection Ritual.' No matter how much they want to keep her locked up, they have to take Kyōri outside for that."

"I see, so that 'Selection Ritual' is the only chance to make contact with Kuon."

"Exactly, so we absolutely cannot afford to fail, no matter what."

<b>

Koharu clenched her fists and muttered with a serious expression.

She genuinely wants to free Kuon from this mansion.

I sympathize with that thought, but...

<b>

(The problem is what to do after we get her out.)

<b>

From what I've gathered about Kuon's behavior and our communications, it's safe to say she isn't pleased with her current situation.

However, those guys are the type to attack me, the guest of the head, without hesitation.

Even if we manage to get her out safely, where will we have her live? How will she maintain her identity? How will we prepare for attacks from them?

<b>

(It would be nice if there were someone who could help us out with a single word in times like this...)

<b>

Just as that thought crossed my mind, another question arose.

<b>

"By the way, have you been living here all along?"

"No. I usually live in the neighboring prefecture, and I came to this mansion during Obon."

"Then was that person, Kuon Sōgen, already in that state back then?"

"Yes. If only my grandfather hadn't ended up like that, my sister wouldn't have had to go through this..."

<b>

While Koharu complained about her grandfather, I pondered her statement.

By the time of Obon, he was already in a state akin to a vegetable.

In fact, the appraisal results indicated that he had been poisoned for a long time, so it should be assumed he was like that even before then.

But if that's the case, who wrote that letter?

<b>

"Hey, are you listening?"

"Sorry, sorry. I was just lost in thought. For now, I think it's a good idea to take Kuon out during the 'Selection Ritual.' But we should also think about how to protect her from those guys afterward."

"...That's true."

"And we should confirm Kuon's own wishes too, right? She might genuinely want to succeed the Kuon family."

"Weren't you listening? My sister—"

"I've already thought that through, so don't worry."

"Ugh..."

<b>

After answering, I glanced at the spot where the monster had melted away during the earlier fight.

I had thought this power struggle in the mansion was solely between the main family and the branch family.

However, that monster—or more accurately, the one who summoned the monster—seemed to belong to neither group, just like Koharu.

I hope they share the same way of thinking as us, but if they turn out to be someone we can't cooperate with at all...

<b>

"Well then, let's hurry down. Your room is very close to this hidden passage."

"Ah, wait, wait. I have one last thing I want to ask."

"What is it?"

"Did you come up with this plan all by yourself? Like creating this hidden passage and figuring out the timing to take Kuon out?"

<b>

Koharu fell silent for a moment at my question, but then opened her mouth as if resigned.

<b>

"Ah, there's someone named Ibara who recently joined the main family as an advisor, and she helped me."

<b>

The Ibara she mentioned is undoubtedly that woman in a kimono I met in the hallway.

At that time, she was following a man who seemed oddly hostile towards me, so does that mean she was spying?

<b>

No good. The information is too scarce for me to understand anything.

I really should have done an 'appraisal' when I passed by her in that hallway.

<b>

"Save your thinking for after we get down, okay? I don't want to be attacked by another creepy monster."

<b>

I followed Koharu down the hidden passage, bowing my head repeatedly.

At first, I thought it was just a simple family feud, but it seems it's not that straightforward.

I'll cooperate with Koharu for now, but if something goes wrong...

<b>

(Damn, I really can't seem to get rid of my worries.)

<b>

Feeling a headache from that thought, we each returned to our respective rooms.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"…So sleepy."

<b>

In the morning, as I groggily got out of bed, I muttered that and headed for the washbasin.

The time shown on my watch was 6:11 AM. It's usually the time when I'm still enjoying the world of dreams in bed.

<b>

"An important ritual that will determine the future of our family will be held early tomorrow morning. We would be grateful if you could participate, Iori-sama."

<b>

I got up because a shikigami came to take away the dinner dishes last night, but honestly, I would like to sleep for another hour.

While thinking that, I changed into the clothes I had packed in my item box and left the room.

<b>

"Whoa!?"

<b>

In the hallway, various types of shikigami were lined up, all bowing their heads to me in unison.

At a glance, there must be at least a hundred of them, right?

<b>

"We have been waiting for you, Iori-sama. We will now guide you to the venue."

"Huh...? What is going on here?"

"It is an order from the head to protect you, Iori-sama, in case of an emergency."

<b>

In case of an emergency, huh? Given what happened yesterday, it's quite possible something similar could occur again, but the fact that these guys could be the ones to cause it makes me uneasy.

More than anything, the fact that the order is coming from that Kuon Sōgen only adds to the suspicion.

<b>

But I don't think they'll just leave if I say, "Please stop," so I might as well comply.

Besides, with this many, I should be able to manage without using my skills.

<b>

So, after walking with a large number of shikigami for about ten minutes, we arrived at a massive courtyard where spectator seats had been set up.

There were probably around 200 people seated in the spectator area, and among them was that Ibara-san.

<b>

"…"

<b>

Ibara waved at me, so I hurriedly nodded back and followed the shikigami to my seat.

<b>

"This is your seat, Iori-sama. If you need anything, please feel free to let me know."

<b>

The other shikigami returned to their respective posts, leaving only a girl-shaped shikigami by my side.

Is she just a servant, or is she a watcher? I can't really tell at this point.

More importantly...

<b>

(Kuon and Koharu are over there.)

<b>

Koharu is seated a few levels below me, accompanied by shikigami, but she appears somewhat isolated.

And Kuon is sitting at one end of a large altar set up in the center of the courtyard...

<b>

"Wow..."

<b>

Is that what breathtaking beauty looks like?

Wearing a kimono with a red and white theme, with red lipstick, and her natural beauty combined, she looks like a celestial maiden.

However, her expression seemed somewhat melancholic.

<b>

"Everyone, I would like to express my deep gratitude on behalf of the senior officials of the Kuon family for your presence at this important ritual today."

<b>

While I was thinking about that, an elderly man in a formal kimono appeared.

<b>

"Now, first, Kuon Genji, please come forward."

"Yeah!"

(…Oh!)

<b>

The man in the kimono who stood up at the elderly man's call was undoubtedly the one who glared at me yesterday.

<b>

(So that’s Kuon Genji. No wonder he hated me.)

<b>

As I was coming to that realization, the man in the formal kimono looked around at us in the spectator seats.

<b>

"Many of you may already be aware, but let me explain once again. The 'Selection Ritual' is a ceremony to decide the head of the Kuon family, who leads the demon exterminators. The candidate will enter the labyrinth where the demons are unleashed alone. The one who can escape from this labyrinth the fastest will be officially chosen as the next head of the Kuon family!"

<b>

Once the man finished speaking, Kuon Genji stood at the center of the altar and confidently drew a small knife.

<b>

"Then, let the 'Selection Ritual' begin!"

<b>

And in the next moment, the patterns around the altar began to emit a dazzling blue light, engulfing Kuon Genji at the center.
