# Episode 61: I Ended Up Playing the Heel 1

"Good morning! Did I keep you waiting a bit?"

"N-no, not at all...?"

<b>

In the square in front of the station during the day, there are many young couples flirting, likely because it's summer vacation.

Until now, I had been the kind of person who thought, "I wish they would just explode," but who could have predicted that it would come to this?

<b>

"…Get it together. If you act all nervous in that outfit, you won't catch any prey!"

"…I-I know."

<b>

This is a strategy, or rather a play, to catch prey.

And since I've stepped onto this stage, I can't afford to panic any further.

<b>

Taking a deep breath to brace myself, I spoke to the beautiful girl with brown hair standing next to me.

<b>

"Well then, shall we go, Arisa?"

"Yes, Shuji-kun."

<b>

With Arisia, who had transformed into a different person using her skills, and with me casting 'Recognition Disruption Magic' to make her appear as a flashy guy to anyone other than Arisia, we headed towards the amusement facility in front of the station.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

How did Arisia and I end up disguising ourselves and pretending to go on a date?

<b>

The origin of this situation traces back to the day we stormed that aerial fortress.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Then we will transport them to the designated hospital. Please be cautious as enemy attacks are expected."

"Understood. Sorry for calling you out so late at night."

"It's the leader's orders. We will take our leave now."

<b>

Saying that, Arisia's subordinate, dressed as an emergency medical technician, saluted her and boarded the ambulance, which is said to belong to her organization, and drove away from this apartment where Safe House No. 6 is located, sirens blaring.

<b>

"It's hot, let's get back to the room quickly."

"Y-yeah, good idea."

<b>

As I blankly watched that, Arisia told me to go back to the room.

I answered somewhat absentmindedly and followed her.

<b>

<b>

The interrogation of the boys and girls who had been wearing hero suits was quickly finished.

It seems that the only suits that had special modifications or enhancements were those, and the individuals inside were simply brainwashed to believe that "we are absolutely right," which could be easily undone with 'Recognition Disruption Magic.'

If that's the case, the rest should be easy. Now that we understood how to put on and take off the hero suits, we tried to extract information from them using 'Recognition Disruption Magic' and the guiding interrogation that Arisia seems to excel at.

<b>

"…It doesn't seem to be going that smoothly, huh?"

<b>

Entering the room, I muttered as I looked at a hero suit spread out in the living room.

<b>

To put it bluntly, the information we obtained was mostly what we already knew or had guessed.

All of them who wore hero suits had experienced being saved by a hero at least once.

They were invited to that aerial fortress by the hero who saved them and ended up wearing hero suits themselves.

As for the hero suits they wore, they were custom-made by a person referred to as 'Brave One' or 'Commander,' taking into account individual traits and aptitudes.

That 'Brave One' is said to always seclude themselves in the deepest part of the aerial fortress and rarely shows their face, only appearing once a week to the one who has achieved the most merit.

<b>

Up to this point, the information matched exactly with what we had obtained through the dolls created with 'Water Magic' sent into the aerial fortress.

<b>

And now for the new information that has come to light, it seems that these heroes are subjected to something like a quota.

That quota involves recruiting new heroes.

At night, a monitor attached to the holder common to the hero suits displays information about villains causing trouble, along with their locations, and they receive instructions to head there.

After defeating the villains with the overwhelming power of the hero suits, they send that letter to the victimized boys and girls, and if they actually come and express their desire to join, they are given something called 'Hero Points,' which can be used to enhance the hero suits or to meet the 'Brave One.'

Moreover, only one hero is allowed to confront a villain, and in order to accumulate points, it seems crucial how quickly they can reach the scene, meaning how much they can enhance their hero suits.

In other words, while they claimed to be a team, they are actually in a competitive relationship.

<b>

(…Ugh. I'm starting to feel sick again…)

<b>

I suddenly recalled the scene of them hurling insults at each other just a moment ago.

The messy outpouring of raw emotions from those who were disguised as 'heroes' was so unpleasant that it made me want to vomit.

What would have happened without Arisia's clever rhetoric?

<b>

(I guess using 'Appraisal' on uninterested strangers is the right approach…)

<b>

Back to the main topic.

<b>

Now, this is the only achievement we can claim, and at the same time, it deepens the mystery.

<b>

"I can't believe not a single one of them remembers the face of that Brave One..."

<b>

Arisia sighed heavily, sat down on the sofa, and began to operate her tablet.

<b>

I weakly replied with an "ah" and, after getting her permission, sank deeply into the sofa as well.

<b>

That pink hero suit, Rose Pink Baroness, had indeed mentioned that she had "met the Brave One once," and several other wearers of hero suits also claimed to have met the Brave One.

However, strangely enough, they remembered nothing about their time with that Brave One.

Yet, they felt an abnormal level of pride in having met that Brave One and expressed a desire to gather points to meet them again.

<b>

At this point, I couldn't help but feel that this 'Brave One' might be some kind of abnormal entity that conducts intense brainwashing.

<b>

In any case, this is all the information we obtained from interrogating the contents of those hero suits.

<b>

(That aerial fortress isn't showing any signs of movement, so what should we do...?)

<b>

I have no idea how the villains, who are the prey to obtain these hero points, are selected, and I can't think of any activity policy.

<b>

"…You know, this might just work."

<b>

While I was pondering this, Arisia, who had been operating her tablet, suddenly stood up as if she had come up with something.

Then she looked at my face, smiled brightly, and said:

<b>

<b>

"Hey, how about going on a date with me next time?"
