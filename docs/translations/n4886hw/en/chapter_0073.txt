# Episode 69: Invited to the Mansion 2

"Please, I'm really counting on you! You're my only hope!"

<b>

September 1. After the opening ceremony, as everyone is preparing to head home, my friend, Asama Rentaro, is pleading with me, bowing deeply with his hands together.

<b>

"First, tell me what you need. Just saying 'please' doesn't tell me what you want."

<b>

Well, considering he's asking me like this right after summer vacation, I have a rough idea of what his purpose is.

<b>

"I haven't finished my homework. I'm begging you, please show me!"

"…I feel like I've heard your lifelong wish at least five times in the last six months."

"Please, I'm really counting on you! Just the math and science subjects!"

<b>

I let out a big sigh.

At this rate, it seems he hasn't finished any of his summer homework, but he's probably trying to at least get through the strict math and science subjects to minimize the damage.

<b>

"Fine. When you get home, take pictures of your homework and send them to me in the chat. In exchange, you owe me a treat next time."

"That really helps!"

<b>

Was he that happy to get a promise from me? Rentaro excitedly leaves the classroom.

<b>

From the looks of it, he probably forgot that there's a test on the assignments next week after summer vacation.

<b>

Thinking about that, I finish getting ready to leave and stand up.

<b>

"…"

<b>

At that moment, my attention unintentionally drifts to the empty seat next to me.

The owner of that seat, Kuon Kyori, who is often referred to as an angel or the saintess of the academy, is not at school today.

It's not particularly unusual for someone to be absent, and I've heard that there are a few students in other classes who are also missing.

<b>

However, what bothers me is―――.

<b>

"Ueshima-san, can I ask you something?"

"Yes?"

<b>

I call out to Ueshima Kanon, the class vice representative who is nearby.

<b>

"Have you heard anything from Kuon about her absence today? You and Kuon are close, right? Since you're both class representatives together."

"…Um, I'm sorry. I don't know the details. I just heard that she would be busy with family matters around the Obon festival and wouldn't be able to answer calls."

<b>

Family matters, that's what's bothering me.

<b>

"Kuon-san will be absent from school for a while due to family circumstances."

<b>

During morning homeroom, our homeroom teacher, Koshimizu-sensei, stated that as the reason for Kuon's absence.

I had been suspicious since she hadn't logged into the class group chat for several days, and it seems her close classmates are also worried about her absence.

<b>

What’s even more concerning is that I can't pinpoint Kuon's location even using "Tracking and Detection Magic."

<b>

And knowing what she does and what her family is like, I can't help but be curious about these so-called "family circumstances."

<b>

Alicia might know something, but right now, she's talking with her friends, and it doesn't seem like a good time to interrupt.

So I thought maybe Ueshima, being a fellow class representative and close to Kuon, might know something… but…

<b>

"I see. Sorry for suddenly talking to you and taking up your time."

"Oh, no, it's totally fine."

<b>

Considering Kuon's personality, it's somewhat natural that no information would come out.

I quickly give up and say that to Ueshima as I try to leave the classroom.

At that moment.

<b>

"Ah! Iori-kun, wait a moment!"

"?"

<b>

Suddenly called out, I stop and receive a folded piece of paper that Ueshima must have torn from a notepad.

<b>

"…Open it when you get home."

"？ Is this――"

"Well then, Iori-kun. See you tomorrow!"

<b>

She says that in a small voice and then leaves the classroom as if nothing had happened.

<b>

What does this mean? Does Ueshima know something she can't talk about here?

Or――.

<b>

(…No matter how much I think about it here, I won't find an answer.)

<b>

I shove the piece of paper into my pants pocket and finally leave the classroom.

For now, I should just focus on getting home as fast as I can.

Telling myself that, I hurried home.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Ah, big brother!"

<b>

After teleporting to an alley near my home using "Spatial Transfer Magic," I walk toward the house when my younger sister, Kana, runs up to me with a worried expression.

<b>

Kana only calls me big brother when she's scared. My expression naturally stiffens.

<b>

"What’s wrong, Kana? Did something happen?"

"Th-there's a strange person standing in front of our house――"

"Strange person?"

<b>

Saying that, Kana points toward our house, slightly panicking.

Upon hearing this, I activate "Cognitive Disruption Magic" and peek at the house from a nearby utility pole.

<b>

(…What the heck is that?)

<b>

A woman in a black kimono, looking like she’s sweating profusely just by being seen in this hot weather, stands in front of our gate with a cold expression like a Noh mask.

If I were to come home and see something like that, I'd definitely panic too.

<b>

("Identification")

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Communication Shikigami

Effect: A shikigami created to reliably convey messages to distant parties. It possesses a certain level of self-defense and information concealment abilities.

Status: Skill Level 10/10

Supplement: Activator is Kuon Sougen.

<b>

――――

<b>

(…A shikigami from Kuon's family?)

<b>

Why the heck is something like that standing in front of my house?

<b>

Feeling anxious, I quickly text Kana to stay where she is and then deactivate "Cognitive Disruption Magic" as I approach the house.

<b>

"Um, excuse me. Do you have business with us?"

<b>

As I speak, the shikigami turns to me with doll-like movements.

<b>

"Are you Iori Shu-sama?"

"…Yes, that's me."

"I apologize for the sudden visit. I have come on the orders of the head of the family to deliver this item. Please accept it."

<b>

The shikigami takes out a letter from its kimono sleeve and offers it to me.

The "head of the family" probably refers to Kuon Sougen.

Why would such a person send me a letter…?

<b>

(…It seems I won't be able to move forward unless I accept this.)

<b>

I look down at the shikigami holding the letter out to me and let out a big sigh, reluctantly accepting it.

…I've been handed a lot of letters today.

<b>

"Thank you for accepting it. If you confirm the contents and agree, please drop a drop of blood on it. Well then."

<b>

After confirming that I received the letter, the shikigami smiles eerily.

Then, in the next moment, its body turns into countless pieces of paper, all of which spontaneously ignite and burn away.

<b>

Damn it, I had so many questions to ask…

<b>

At that moment, I receive a message on my phone.

The sender is Kana, and the content simply says, "Are you okay?"

<b>

I should probably ease her worries first.

<b>

Thinking that, I reply to Kana, "You can come out now."

Immediately, Kana, still looking worried, runs up to me and hugs me tightly.

<b>

"W-what was that person?"

"…They said they mistook our house for a friend's house. When I told them it wasn't, they quickly apologized and left."

"R-really? I'm glad."

<b>

As I speak in a way that makes her believe it due to "Cognitive Disruption Magic," it seems the tension finally breaks, and Kana slumps down to the ground.

Well, it was genuinely scary, that shikigami.

<b>

"For now, let's go inside and have lunch."

"Y-yeah."

<b>

I extend my hand to Kana to help her up, and we enter the house together.

<b>

I feel like I'm getting wrapped up in something incredibly troublesome, realizing that fact.
