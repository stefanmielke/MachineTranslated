# Episode 88: The Decisive Battle Begins 3

"Is, is it really okay, Iori-kun?!"

"It's fine, it's fine, I've packed plenty of shock-absorbing foam. More importantly, I think once this stops, the battle will start immediately, so just be ready."

"I, I understand...!"

<b>

Right now, we were experiencing a roller coaster ride inside that spherical object that looked like it was entangled in tree roots.

Of course, all that creepy liquid that was originally inside had been expelled, and aside from the function of heading towards the target person—Kuon Genji—it had undergone major modifications, so the safety of the people inside was guaranteed to some extent, or so I hoped.

But well, the problem was...

<b>

"...Did I pack too much of the acceleration explosives?"

"Did, did you just say something suspicious right now!?"

"Don't worry, it's really fine."

"I believe you!? I really believe you, okay!?"

<b>

The moment Kyosato shouted that, the sphere shook violently and finally came to a complete stop.

At the same time, the shock-absorbing, wet, elastic foam that had been installed inside deployed to protect our bodies.

<b>

"...See? I told you it was fine, right?"

"Y-yeah..."

<b>

To be honest, I was also anxious, but I'm just glad it worked without a hitch.

While thinking such pathetic thoughts, I opened the hatches installed at various points of the sphere and leaned out—

<b>

"That was close."

<b>

I muttered while looking at the shattered wooden arrow in my palm, cold sweat trickling down as I glared at the culprit who had thrown it.

<b>

"...Iori-kun?"

"You should wait a little longer inside. The opponent seems to be quite furious."

<b>

Kyosato probably guessed most of what was going on from that statement, as she lightly nodded at me and retreated deeper into the sphere while taking out several talismans.

<b>

"It was you! It was you who appeared and turned everything upside down...! I was supposed to be the king who governs Kuon and exorcism!"

<b>

The man, enveloped in something like black mist, glared at us with red eyes and let out a roar like a battle cry.

<b>

"Wait, we have no reason to oppose you. You will become the head of Kuon, and we will safely return home. That's a win-win, right?"

"Shut up! You, who have mocked me so many times up until now!!"

<b>

Saying that, the man—Kuon Genji—let out another battle cry, ripped a nearby branch off a tree, and transformed it into an arrow-like shape before hurling it straight at me.

<b>

In response, I tried to generate a slime-like wall with 'Water Magic' to block the attack.

<b>

"Watch out!"

"Whoa!?"

<b>

Suddenly being pulled into the sphere by Kyosato, the arrow exploded without any warning.

<b>

"That really saved me. Thank you."

"It’s not like you need to thank me... More importantly, please be careful. Genji-san is abnormally strong now."

"I figured as much..."

<b>

Right after throwing the arrow, Kuon Genji was panting heavily, but it would be more accurate to say he was excited rather than exhausted from using power.

Adding to the trouble was the presence of the 'Omono'.

<b>

(It's tied so tightly around her shoulders that there's no way just taking Kyosato would go without resistance. That means I have to find some way to incapacitate him.)

<b>

While I was thinking that, Kuon Genji turned towards us and screamed in rage.

<b>

"Kyosato!! You're there too, huh!? You too, you too have taken everything from me!!"

<b>

Tch, he noticed Kyosato's presence as well.

I had put 'Recognition Obstruction' on her, but...

<b>

"Hehehe."

<b>

Above Kuon Genji, a girl named Ibara sat on a particularly thick branch compared to the surroundings, wearing a suspicious smile as if everything was going according to plan.

And her gaze was undoubtedly fixed on Kyosato inside the sphere.

<b>

One against two, and I have to protect Kyosato too...

I summoned an MP potion water sphere again, swallowed it, and took a deep breath.

<b>

"Iori-kun, I have a request."

<b>

At that moment, Kyosato spoke to me seriously.

<b>

"A request?"

"You have the ability to lend 'skills' to others, right?"

"Y-yeah. I do, but..."

"Then could you lend me those skills? If possible, the ability to enhance physical abilities and the power to freeze things that you lent me before."

<b>

Lending skills itself is fine.

But what that implies is...

<b>

"Are you saying you want to fight seriously on the front lines?"

"Today was originally supposed to be that kind of day."

<b>

Kyosato's eyes were very strong as she spoke.

...It seems that persuading her would only increase the risk.

However, if Kyosato is participating, then I might be able to do that.

<b>

"Alright. But you must absolutely follow my plan and not do anything reckless. You have to keep these two promises."

"Yes!"

"And finally, I want to ask you two things, is that okay?"

"W-what is it?"

"Um, first..."

<b>

At my question, she looked momentarily stunned, then shook her head.

Thank goodness, then I can only lend Kyosato something extraordinary.

<b>

"I think we should go with this plan. Can you do it?"

"That would put a burden on you, Iori-kun..."

"Don't worry about me. Just wait for that moment, Kyosato."

"…Yes!"

<b>

After confirming one last time, I generated a water wall with blast resistance using 'Water Magic' to ensure safety, then looked towards Kyosato.

<b>

And then—

<b>

"Skill Lending!"

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"If you won't come out...!"

<b>

Kuon Genji wrapped himself in even more black mist, changing the mist into the shape of a hand to grab the thick branch where Ibara was sitting.

<b>

"Oh dear, Genji-sama. If you're going to use it, you should have told me in advance."

"Shut up!! Just stay quiet and follow me!!"

<b>

I don't know what method he used, but after yelling at Ibara floating in the air, Kuon Genji transformed the branch into a giant spear and hurled it at the modified sphere we were in.

Perhaps he was pushed too far, as the sphere made a satisfying cracking sound and collapsed on the spot.

Of course, we knew that this sphere wouldn't last long.

<b>

"Where the hell is it!? Where did it escape to!?"

"Right here."

"Dammit!!"

<b>

Amidst the dust, I moved directly below and attempted to kick Kuon Genji in the stomach.

<b>

"Oh, that's dangerous."

<b>

But just before my attack could hit, his body moved as if it were being reeled in right next to Ibara.

<b>

"Ibara! Why did you interfere!?"

"If I hadn't, you would have been knocked out in an instant, wouldn't you? And look."

<b>

The moment Kuon Genji lifted his face, Kyosato jumped high, attempting to touch the 'Omono' that was draped over his shoulder like an ornament.

<b>

"Kyosato!!"

"Ugh!?"

<b>

As soon as he spotted Kyosato, Kuon Genji shouted loudly and unleashed countless paper shikigami at her to tear her away.

Kyosato defended herself with a shield of 'Ice Magic' and created distance using 'Physical Enhancement'.

<b>

Damn, I knew it wouldn't go that smoothly...!

<b>

"The numbers are the same... Genji-sama, what will you do?"

"I will kill Iori Shu!! You take care of those annoying limbs from Kyosato!!"

"Yes, as you command."

<b>

With those words from Ibara, they split into two groups and simultaneously attacked us.

<b>

Genji launched a barrage of paper shikigami and projectiles using branches and bark, while Ibara hurled fiery arms shaped like limbs at Kyosato.

<b>

"Damn, this is really annoying...!"

"Die, die, die, die, die, die!!!"

<b>

"It seems you've gained borrowed power, but you're just being tossed around. To think you would laugh with the daughter of Kuon."

"Ugh...!"

<b>

Perhaps due to the laws of the land being on their side, we were gradually pushed back, eventually cornered against the walls.

<b>

And then...

<b>

"Goodbye, pitiful young lady."

<b>

"Kyaaaah!"

<b>

The fiery arm unleashed by Ibara grabbed Kyosato and burned her body to ashes without leaving a trace.

<b>

"Ahhh!!!"

<b>

Seeing that, I lost my composure and generated an ice sword, charging at Kuon Genji with it.

<b>

"Is this your last desperate struggle? Do it, Ibara."

"Yes, I understand."

<b>

However, Kuon Genji's body once again floated into the air due to Ibara's mysterious power, and my attack ended up missing.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

...That's what they must be thinking.

<b>

<b>

"Now!!"

<b>

I shouted loudly just before swinging down my sword.

At the same time, Ibara sensed something, her expression changing as she looked up at the sky.

<b>

"Genji! Cut the 'Connection'!"

"You! What are you talking about...!?"

<b>

At Ibara's shout from above, Kuon Genji looked up at her with irritation, and finally realized.

But it was already too late.

<b>

"Haahhh!!"

<b>

The 'real Kyosato', who had been completely concealed by the two of us using 'Recognition Obstruction Magic', descended from above while using 'Physical Enhancement', gripping the last trump card—the 'Spirit Sword "Mumei"' obtained during the summer camp.

<b>

What that blade would sever was―――.

<b>

"With this, you can no longer steal power from anyone, nor anything."

"Ah, what!?"

<b>

It was the very 'property of the Omono' that Kuon Genji was wearing, which absorbed power from others.
