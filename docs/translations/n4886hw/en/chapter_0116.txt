# Chapter 111: The Cultural Festival Has Begun 3

"Wh-what happened to the person inside...?"

"We have to call the teacher quickly!"

<b>

Witnessing the abnormal phenomenon, the surrounding students fell into a state of panic.

This has turned into quite a troublesome situation...

If I use the drone's 'Recognition Disruption Magic' to put the students here to sleep, it might only escalate the chaos. On the other hand, if I leave it as it is, some students might end up entering that mysterious space.

<b>

(...I don't know how long this will hold, but I guess I should do it for now)

<b>

I activated 'Water Magic' and set up walls mimicking the surrounding structures to block the gate leading to the abnormal space, then turned to Kyosato.

<b>

"I've temporarily prevented other students from entering. But I don't know how long it will last, so let's step outside for now and think about what to do next."

"Understood. Let's leave the school building before the confusion escalates."

<b>

After whispering this, we hurried towards the school gate, but...

<b>

"Hey!? What's going on here!?"

"Why can't we get out!?"

"What is this fog... it's scary..."

"Calm down, everyone! For now, let's head to the gym―――"

<b>

In front of the school gate, students and teachers were crowding, all of them in a state of panic.

And the reason for their panic was immediately clear from the scene outside the school building and the abnormal phenomena occurring to students trying to leave the school grounds.

<b>

Outside the school building, a thick fog had formed, obscuring even the surrounding buildings.

It was clear when I was in line to buy a hot dog just a moment ago, and for the weather to change so drastically in such a short time is abnormal.

And what's even more unsettling is――.

<b>

"Damn it! Why are they coming back!?"

<b>

Students who tried to rush outside quickly returned looking extremely fatigued.

It seems this thick fog has the abnormal property of forcibly returning anyone attempting to leave to their original location.

<b>

Is this――similar to the barrier we were trapped in during the forest school trip?

If so, escaping with 'Spatial Transfer Magic' would be dangerous...

<b>

"...Shu-kun. I think we can talk calmly in the courtyard since there are fewer people who know about it."

<b>

While I was pondering what to do, Kyosato suggested this.

Indeed, few people know about that place, and given the commotion, everyone is outside, making it a perfect spot for discussing our next steps.

<b>

"...Alright. Let's talk there."

<b>

I replied quietly and took advantage of the confusion to move with Kyosato to the courtyard.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The courtyard of this school is somewhat secluded and hidden away.

It seems this is due to the reconstruction of the school building and the addition of club rooms, leading to many teachers being unaware of its existence.

Perhaps because of this, the courtyard is exempt from cleaning duties, and it has become a comfortable place for a select few students to share conversations they prefer to keep private.

<b>

When I first heard about this from Rentaro shortly after we became friends, I was skeptical, thinking, "Is that really true? Am I being tricked by an upperclassman?" But now, after half a year since entering school, I realize it's indeed true.

<b>

"All students and faculty are to gather in the gym immediately! I repeat! All students and――"

<b>

The speakers installed throughout the school continuously called for students to move to the gym, but no students or teachers could be seen heading there from the courtyard.

That said, it would be dangerous to let our guard down or become complacent here. I deployed a drone with 'Recognition Disruption Magic' to ensure we wouldn't be seen and began to speak.

<b>

"...This is bad. There's no communication with the outside at all."

"Does that include the doll?"

"Yeah. Moreover, the drones I had deployed near the school building have also lost their response."

<b>

Looks like when we return, we'll have to start over. It takes quite a bit of time and concentration to make those, so gathering everything is a bit of a hassle...

Well, that's only if we can return.

<b>

"It seems Alicia isn't in the school either, so we might be the only ones who can handle this situation."

"I see... This has become quite troublesome..."

<b>

Yes, the current situation is incredibly troublesome.

Unlike during the forest school trip, at least over a hundred teachers and students are involved, and if some kind of monster appears, I don't know if we can protect everyone.

And it's likely that this bizarre situation will only worsen.

In other words, we need to identify the source of this abnormal phenomenon as quickly as possible and do something about it.

I focused on the information from the deployed reconnaissance drones and began to think about our next move.

<b>

"For now, the first place we should investigate is the haunted house. I did a quick survey of the school, but the only other abnormal occurrence aside from the fog is there. Plus, it seems there are quite a few people trapped inside."

"Understood. Let's hurry over there."

"...Yeah, let's do that."

<b>

Saying this, Kyosato immediately began preparing to depart.

...To be honest, I feel nothing but anxiety about taking Kyosato into that unknown space where anything could happen, and she shouldn't have to bear the responsibility of resolving such a situation. I want her to stay in a safe place and spend her time peacefully.

On the other hand, given the current situation where we don't know when anything might happen, I can't say for certain that there's a completely safe place in this abnormal space.

So, it might be safer to stick together rather than split up and act recklessly.

<b>

"Alright, let's go."

"Yes!"

<b>

After confirming that we were both ready, I activated 'Recognition Disruption Magic' so that we wouldn't be recognized and then left the courtyard.

<b>

"Hey, don't push!"

"Why... why is this happening!?"

"I can't take this anymore..."

"Let me through already!?"

<b>

As expected, the school was in chaos, with students trying to evacuate to the gym as quickly as possible, creating a terrible situation.

I held Kyosato's hand and activated 'Body Enhancement,' using jumps and wall kicks to approach the stairs, then dashed up to the second floor where the haunted house was located in one breath.

Once I confirmed that there were no people around, I turned to Kyosato.

<b>

"Are you okay? Are you hurt?"

"Y-yes. I'm fine."

"Got it. Then let's keep going, alright?"

<b>

Seeing Kyosato's demeanor, I judged that she wasn't just putting on a brave face and turned my gaze towards where the haunted house had been.

At first glance, it seemed that the abnormal space hadn't changed at all since it appeared.

<b>

('Water Magic')

<b>

I created a new reconnaissance drone and sent it into the abnormal space, but the moment it passed through the gate, all responses from the drone ceased.

...Looks like we have no choice but to enter directly.

Just as I was about to call Kyosato to prepare, suddenly...

<b>

"Zuuuuuuun..."

"What is...!?"

<b>

The entire school building shook violently, and I nearly stumbled.

It's safe to say that this tremor is not just an ordinary earthquake. Something abnormal is happening again.

As I looked around, I noticed that the gate and the objects around it were vibrating as if being pushed up from the inside.

...Is something trying to break through the water magic wall and come out from the abnormal space?

<b>

"Kyosato, we might have to fight soon, so get ready."

"Y-yes!"

<b>

At my words, Kyosato took out a talisman and nodded firmly.

Alright. Then let's go.

<b>

"We don't know what will happen. If you feel it's dangerous, escape immediately."

<b>

After telling Kyosato this, I dispelled the wall that was sealing the gate and leaped into the abnormal space.

<b>

"......aaaAAAAAAAAAA!!!"

<b>

---And in the next moment, a massive flesh-colored object fell towards us.

<b>

"Ugh!?"

<b>

I caught it with 'Body Enhancement' and, while holding Kyosato, quickly distanced myself from the attacking entity.

<b>

"Shu-kun! Are you okay!?"

"Y-yeah. I'm totally fine, but..."

<b>

I looked around the interior of the abnormal space while deploying multiple shields with 'Water Magic.'

<b>

It was a horror-filled place that seemed to stretch the haunted house's attractions to their limits.

Dark classrooms filled with oversized desks, chairs, and blackboards that made it feel as if we had turned into dolls ourselves.

And at the center stood something resembling a doll of a woman, about five meters tall, with hair that reached her feet and six additional arms sprouting from her back, glaring at us with glowing red eyes that could be seen even through her long bangs.

<b>

"Someone... help me..."

"I-it hurts... it hurts so much..."

"It hurts... it hurts..."

<b>

At the ends of those six arms were students who had likely been trapped inside the haunted house, grasped tightly and screaming.

<b>

(...Fighting while hostages are taken. This is troublesome.)

<b>

I created a water sword and a drone for remote attacks and distractions with 'Water Magic,' taking a combat stance while holding the sword.
