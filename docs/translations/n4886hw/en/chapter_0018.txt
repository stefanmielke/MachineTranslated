# Chapter 16: I Was Asked to Exterminate a Monster 1

“Phew…”

<b>

After the homeroom ended, I somehow managed to escape the classroom surrounded by my classmates and headed to the location noted on the memo given to me by Kuon.

<b>

“Is this the place...?”

<b>

The place I arrived at was a small room in the corner of the club building.

In the center of the door, the words “Literary Club” were written modestly.

I didn’t even know there was a Literary Club at this school.

<b>

“Alright…”

<b>

I steeled myself and knocked on the door.

<b>

“Come in.”

“Excuse me…”

<b>

As I cautiously opened the door, Kyori Kuon was sitting in seiza on a tatami mat waiting for me in the back of the room.

<b>

Um, what am I supposed to do here?

Do I have to take off my shoes and sit in seiza too? No, but what is the purpose of this meeting anyway?

While I was thinking about such things, Kuon suddenly placed three fingers on the ground.

<b>

“Thank you very much for helping me last night.”

<b>

……Huh?

Wait, huh? How does she know I helped her?

<b>

“It’s your wristwatch.”

<b>

As I was confused by this unexpected turn of events, Kuon pointed at the bag I was holding.

<b>

“The wristwatch you brought today is the same one that the person who helped me last night had. And the alarm that went off.”

“Ah…”

<b>

Finally realizing it after her pointing it out.

That digital wristwatch was worn to notify me when the recognition-inhibiting magic was lifted.

If it was just to tell the time, I could have used my smartphone, but since I was doing various reckless things, I thought it would be a waste if it broke, so I continued using this wristwatch.

Well, the result of that is what it is now.

<b>

“Yeah, I was the one who helped Kuon yesterday. So, did you call me here just to thank me?”

“That is…”

<b>

If she just wanted to say thank you, she could have conveyed it subtly in the classroom while keeping the truth hidden.

There’s a possibility she’s concerned about the eyes around her, but if that were the case, she wouldn’t have handed me the memo in such a bold manner.

<b>

In other words, there’s another reason why Kuon called me here.

<b>

“...That’s true. It would be rude to deceive you here.”

<b>

Saying that, Kuon deeply bowed her head to me.

<b>

“Please. I need your help to exterminate the demons that are lurking in this town!”

<b>

And so she earnestly asked me to do such a thing.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

According to her, various demons have existed in this country since ancient times.

They fed on the fear gained by harming people to expand their territory.

To counter such demons, people who gained power emerged, and they are called demon hunters.

Kyori Kuon is said to be a descendant of such demon hunters, exterminating demons night after night.

And now, in this town, a certain great demon that has escaped from its seal is lurking.

<b>

“I currently do not have the power to exterminate it. Please, will you cooperate with me to save this town? Of course, I will also pay you a reward.”

<b>

<b>

Huh, is this world really filled with such fantasy...?

Well, I did see it with my own eyes, so Kuon’s story must be true...

<b>

(“Appraisal”)

<b>

―――

<b>

Kyori Kuon, Human, 16 years old

Condition: Minor cuts and bruises on arms, knees, and shoulders; sweating; in a state of extreme tension

Note: Injured in a battle against a demon on orders from the main family and is in a state of fatigue

Also feeling anxious about whether her story will be believed and if she will be trusted or killed

<b>

―――

<b>

Looking at this appraisal result, it seems she isn’t lying or trying to deceive me, right?

<b>

In any case, Kuon is an abnormal or fantasy being, and she is one of the few humans who knows about my abilities.

For now, I’ll cooperate while observing and monitoring Kuon and those close to her.

And if it comes down to it...

<b>

“Alright. I don’t know what I can do, but I’ll cooperate as much as I can.”

“Really!? Thank you so much!”

<b>

Hearing my response, Kuon showed a relieved expression.

<b>

“By the way, I’d like to confirm something; you are human, right?”

<b>

For a moment, I didn’t understand what she was saying, but then I remembered what I had shown her in front of her and understood the meaning of her question.

<b>

Well, normally, a regular human wouldn’t suddenly create ice, punch a massive monster weighing hundreds of kilograms into the air with an uppercut, or teleport to another location.

That’s probably why she asked such a question.

<b>

“I believe I’m a pure human.”

“Then how do you have such power?”

<b>

…Well, since Kuon is on the side of the fantasy or the abnormal, it should be fine to tell her the truth.

She probably wouldn’t make a big fuss about it.

<b>

“Do you know about the gas explosion incident that happened two years ago at ■■ Middle School?”

“Yeah, it was in the news at the time. I believe 25 students died.”

“Ah, but that’s not the truth. On that day, all the students in that classroom, except for me, were summoned to another world.”

“...Another world?”

<b>

Kuon seemed to have no idea what I was talking about.

Well, it’s understandable to be confused when suddenly told, “I was summoned to another world.”

<b>

“Have you ever played an RPG, Kuon?”

“Um, I haven’t actually played it, but I know it’s a game where you defeat monsters, get stronger, and go to defeat the Demon King.”

“If you know that much, this will be quick. The world I was almost summoned to was exactly like that game. It was a world with skills and statuses, just like an RPG where a Demon King exists.”

<b>

Somehow, I think she grasped what I was trying to say.

Kuon looked at me with a face that said, “No way.”

<b>

“On that day, I, who was not summoned to another world, somehow gained game-like statuses, skills, and the ability to level up.”

<b>

After saying that, I summoned an “Item Box” and took out a sports drink from it to quench my dry throat.
