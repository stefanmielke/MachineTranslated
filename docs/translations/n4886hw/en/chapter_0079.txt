# Chapter 75: Invited to the Mansion 3

"This is the 'Corridor of Water Surface' that leads to the grand hall."

<b>

The place guided by the shikigami was a magnificent corridor made of double-sided glass, cutting through a splendid Japanese garden.

Perhaps because it was built over a dry landscape garden, it felt as if I were standing on the water.

<b>

(Ah, so that's why it's called the 'Corridor of Water Surface'...)

<b>

Just as I was walking down the corridor, lost in such carefree thoughts, the shikigami suddenly bowed deeply towards the opposite end of the corridor.

Wondering what was going on, I looked in the direction the shikigami was bowing, and I belatedly noticed a pair of men and women walking towards us from the other side.

<b>

One was a tall, slender man, likely a decade older than me, dressed casually in a black T-shirt and jeans, while the other was a girl, probably younger than me, with a bun hairstyle and a beautiful red kimono.

<b>

"――っ！"

<b>

As the man passed by me, he frowned as if he had seen something unpleasant.

<b>

(...Have I met that person somewhere?)

<b>

While I was confused by the sudden hostile gaze from a stranger, the girl in the red kimono stopped in front of me with a gentle smile.

<b>

"Are you Iori Shu-sama?"

"Yes, I am... and you are?"

"I apologize for the delay, but I am Ibara, a consultant for the Kuon family. Please allow me to introduce myself."

<b>

Saying that, the girl in the red kimono, or rather Ibara, bowed her head.

Wait, does that mean she holds such a significant position as a consultant? Is she older than me?

<b>

"So, what do you need from me?"

"Oh no, I just wanted to greet you since I heard you would be coming, and that’s why I approached you."

"Uh, oh, I see... So you knew about me?"

"Of course. Iori-sama is a promising star renowned in the supernatural community."

"Huh..."

<b>

Well, I had heard it from Alicia, but it really seems my name is known in the supernatural world.

If that's the case, I have to consider the story about being supported by the side branch while gathering hate from the main family as true...

<b>

(...Ah, my stomach hurts)

<b>

While I was receiving Ibara-san's praise, the man who had glared at me suddenly raised his voice in evident irritation.

<b>

"Ibara! How long are you going to waste time chatting?!"

"I apologize. I will be right there. ...Well then, Iori-sama, I must take my leave here."

<b>

Ibara-san showed an apologetic expression and lightly bowed her head before walking towards the man.

<b>

(Ah... I'm really tired...)

<b>

Once their figures disappeared, I let out a big sigh.

<b>

Even though I was being praised, the content was what it was. Plus, I had been glared at by that man the whole time Ibara-san was talking. It was really awkward.

<b>

"Thank you for your patience. I will resume the tour."

"Whoa!?"

<b>

Just as I was relieved to be freed from that uncomfortable space, the shikigami, which had been frozen like a statue until now, suddenly moved, causing me to let out a strange sound.

The other shikigami, however, showed no reaction to my actions and walked towards the room of Kuon Sougen at the innermost part.

<b>

I hurriedly followed the shikigami, and soon we arrived at a sliding door that seemed to be about the same size as the limousine we took to get to this mansion.

<b>

"Beyond this point is the grand hall where the head, Kuon Sougen, is located. I have not been granted permission to enter beyond this point, so I apologize, but you must enter the room alone."

<b>

As I was astonished by the size of the sliding door, the shikigami conveyed this in a businesslike tone and once again froze as if it had become a statue.

<b>

I have to go in alone... Well, considering the possibilities, that might be easier.

But the thought of being alone with a stranger old man is...

<b>

(...Well, I can't move forward without entering)

<b>

Telling myself that, I slowly opened the sliding door, making sure I could activate my skills at any moment.

<b>

What spread beyond the sliding door was a tatami room that, compared to the structure of the main estate resembling a game dungeon, was still within the realm of common sense in terms of size.

The sliding doors on both sides were opened, allowing a view of the splendid dry landscape garden, and thanks to the cool breeze constantly flowing into the room, the indoor humidity and temperature were comfortably maintained without the need for air conditioning.

<b>

But what caught my eye the most was what was in the center of the room.

<b>

It was something so out of place that it felt almost alien.

An old man, dressed in a plain-colored kimono, sat on a cushion in a slumped state, drooling from his half-open mouth while staring vacantly into space, with a male shikigami by his side.

<b>

Huh? No way, that can't be...

<b>

Feeling anxious about the unexpected situation, I cautiously approached the old man, and the shikigami that had been frozen like the one that guided me suddenly moved and lightly shook the old man's body in an attempt to wake him.

<b>

"Please wake up, Sougen-sama. A guest has arrived."

"Mm, ah? Ahh..."

<b>

In response to the shikigami's words, the old man groaned rather than replied and began staring vacantly at nothing again.

<b>

Seeing that, I had a bad feeling and activated the skill "Appraisal" on the old man.

<b>

――――

<b>

Kuon Sougen, Human, 76 years old

Condition: Severe poison state, arthritis, consciousness disorder...etc

Note: Has been poisoned for an extended period, causing impairment to life activities.

<b>

――――

<b>

...It seems my bad feeling has come true.

The person I thought was the final boss, Kuon Sougen, had already exited the game.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Genji-sama, you seem displeased. What’s the matter?"

<b>

In the corridor of the main estate of the Kuon family, the girl in the red kimono— Ibara spoke to the man in a gentle tone.

<b>

"It’s only natural to be displeased! Just thinking that that bastard who keeps interfering with my plans is under the same roof makes my insides boil!"

<b>

In response, the man dressed casually in a T-shirt and jeans— Kuon Genji, roared back while clenching his fists so tightly that blood was about to come out.

<b>

"Yes, yes, I understand. But you do know, don’t you? That we cannot compete with him, who is a supernatural being?"

"Ugh...!"

<b>

At Ibara's words, Genji's face twisted.

<b>

Supernatural beings are nearly omnipotent. For some reason, that man seems to be unconsciously saving his abilities, but even so, there is a vast gap in power between us, who rely on technology developed by ancient supernatural beings.

What’s more troublesome is that because he is using his abilities suppressed, that man shows no signs of the impending doom that most supernatural beings face.

Thus, opposing that man means engaging in a losing battle against a rational supernatural being whose abilities are unknown.

<b>

(I know that! But!)

<b>

Kuon Genji stopped and clenched his fists even tighter.

<b>

Even though he understood it in his head, he couldn't easily accept it emotionally.

If that man hadn’t been there, he would have surely secured the position of the next head.

Yet...!

<b>

"—Rest assured. Your victory is guaranteed by me, Ibara."

<b>

Saying that, Ibara hugged Genji from behind and whispered in his ear.

<b>

"Ah, yes... You’re right... You’re here for me..."

"Yes, so you can relax and just prepare yourself."

<b>

In an instant, Genji, completely drained of strength, walked away muttering something like a mantra.

<b>

(...Now, let’s see your true power.)

<b>

Meanwhile, Ibara, with a mysterious smile, gazed in the direction they had come from and lightly followed Genji.
