# Episode 45: The Test of Courage Has Begun 1

"Finally made it back..."

"It was surprisingly scary..."

<b>

The evening of the third day of the forest school.

A pair of female students who had completed all the checkpoints for the test of courage returned to the starting point, sweating nervously.

After stamping their cards with the final stamp, they headed towards the line for those who cleared the event, relief evident on their faces.

<b>

In a way, this test of courage is the highlight event of the forest school.

<b>

Students are paired up in twos to visit checkpoints and collect stamps while aiming for this starting point, which is also the goal.

It seems that various traps set up by the test of courage staff are placed before each checkpoint, and from what I've heard from those who cleared it, the quality is quite impressive.

<b>

"Next is our turn."

"Please don't hold me back."

"You better not cling to me out of fear."

<b>

As the turn came around, Rentaro and Kobayashi took their stamp cards and entered the course.

Once the last pair returns, it will be our turn.

So far, it seems like nothing serious has happened, so let's enjoy it casually.

<b>

"---Iori-kun."

"Whoa, Kuuon? What's up?"

<b>

While I was thinking about that, Kuuon, who had been sitting next to me, spoke up.

<b>

"...I'm sorry. There’s a place I want to visit during this test of courage. So, um... could you help me?"

<b>

The place she wants to visit is most likely that monument.

However, since teachers and guides are stationed at various points along the test of courage course for safety, slipping away without being noticed would be quite difficult.

And the monument is located slightly off the course.

That means I’ll have to help her.

<b>

"...Got it. Just let me know when the time comes to slip away."

"Thank you."

<b>

As we were talking, our turn finally came.

<b>

"Here are your stamp cards and flashlights. If anything happens, please call out to the nearby teachers or guides."

<b>

After receiving the stamp cards (which have a map of the test of courage course on the back) and flashlights at the reception, we entered the dimly lit forest.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, the test of courage staff knows where all the traps are set. Wouldn't that make it not a real test of courage?"

"No, each staff member is only responsible for one trap per class, so they are not informed about the traps of other classes."

<b>

I see, that means the staff can also enjoy the test of courage.

If I hadn't heard the story about the cursed sword legend, I would have honestly been impressed by how well thought out it is.

<b>

"But you know the locations, right? So, do you know any places we could slip away?"

"I found a few potential spots, but it seems difficult for me alone to completely outsmart the teachers' watch..."

<b>

Saying that, Kuuon marked a circle on the map on the back of her stamp card with the pen she had.

<b>

"The red circles indicate the teachers and guides, while the black circles indicate potential escape spots."

"…It does seem tough to outsmart them."

<b>

In the mountains and forests, anything can happen.

This setup was likely designed so that if something occurs, they can quickly rush to the students.

To outsmart this without any tricks is indeed difficult, if not nearly impossible.

<b>

But that’s only if we’re talking about ordinary people.

<b>

"Alright, let's head from this third checkpoint towards the monument. It's the shortest distance in a straight line."

"Understood. So how do we proceed?"

<b>

"Well, I'll just use my usual trick."

<b>

I answered Kuuon's question like that and, while pulling her hand, activated the skill "Cognitive Disruption Magic."

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Is something wrong, Maruyama-sensei?"

"Oh, no, I just felt like something passed by nearby, but it seems it was just my imagination."

<b>

Ignoring the teacher who was talking, we advanced deeper into the forest.

After walking for a while, we finally arrived at the intended monument.

<b>

"...Are you okay?"

"Y-yes! I'm fine!"

<b>

Seeing Kuuon frozen, I couldn't help but feel anxious and asked her, to which she responded somewhat flustered for some reason.

...Is she really okay?

<b>

"Still, Iori-kun's ability is amazing every time I see it...!"

"Flattery won't get you anywhere."

<b>

While we were talking, we should have reached the location of the monument... or so I thought.

<b>

"Um, is this really the place?"

"It should be..."

<b>

At the location, there was no monument, only what looked like a crushed base and a hole as if something had been dug up.

<b>

(“Appraisal”)

<b>

―――

<b>

Target: Monument

Condition: Completely destroyed by shovels and hammers.

Note: Built by farmers to honor the souls of a samurai and a princess who died here 450 years ago.

<b>

―――

<b>

The result of the "Appraisal" clearly indicates that this was the location of the monument.

Then what is this hole...?

<b>

"...There are remnants of youki at the bottom of this hole."

"Remnants of youki?"

"Yes. It seems something that emitted strong youki was buried in this hole."

<b>

Just as I was bewildered by this unexpected situation.

<b>

"“Waaahhh!?””

<b>

Suddenly, screams echoed from deep within the forest.

<b>

"Was that Asama-kun and Kobayashi-kun's voices...?"

"Probably. It seems something serious is about to happen."

<b>

We exchanged glances and quickly reactivated the "Cognitive Disruption Magic," hurrying towards the direction of the voices.
