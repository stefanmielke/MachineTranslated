# Episode 17: I Was Asked to Subdue a Monster 2

"Um, well, that's..."

"'Item Box.' It's a 'skill' that allows you to store items freely."

<b>

Seeing the sudden appearance of the white box, I calmly explain to Kuon.

After all, the most effective way to explain something is to show it in action.

<b>

"So, that means the thing that suddenly disappeared yesterday..."

<b>

I take out a broken wristwatch from my bag and teleport it to the drawer of my desk at home using 'Spatial Transfer Magic.'

<b>

After witnessing my series of actions, she seems to understand whether she likes it or not.

That I truly possess a power like a game.

<b>

"Is there anything else you want to ask?"

"…Can I also obtain that power?"

"I don't know. The one who tried to summon us to this other world probably knows how to do it."

"I see."

<b>

Upon hearing my response, Kuon shows a somewhat dejected expression.

If she hears that there are abilities to freely handle skills like in a game and to level up and become stronger, it's only natural that she would want to obtain them.

<b>

"Then I have a question. What kind of being is this great demon that escaped?"

<b>

When I ask, Kuon takes an old scroll out of her bag and unfolds it.

What was depicted there was the head of a demon with black skin and cow-like horns, and a monster with a spider's body.

<b>

"This is the demon 'Ushi-Oni' that is currently lurking in this town."

"Ushi-Oni... I've heard that name before."

"He's a famous yokai. That makes him powerful and dangerous. And the most troublesome part is..."

<b>

As she unfolds the scroll further, it shows the Ushi-Oni disguised as a woman attacking people.

<b>

"I see, so the Ushi-Oni in hiding is taking on a human form."

"Yes. And we would prefer to keep our existence as low-profile as possible. So..."

"In other words, we need to find and take down the Ushi-Oni before any damage occurs and it causes a commotion, right?"

"That's correct. I truly apologize for imposing various restrictions."

"That's fine, no problem."

<b>

I had prepared myself for the possibility of getting into a troublesome situation the moment I came to hear about this.

If the information she provided is true, I should be able to handle it adequately now.

If there's a problem, it would be...

<b>

"I just want to confirm, you have a lead on finding the transformed Ushi-Oni, right?"

"Yes. I have already dispatched shikigami to sense the youki throughout the entire town. No matter how much it disguises itself as a human, a youkai is still a youkai. It cannot completely hide the youki emanating from its body."

<b>

Since they are proposing to exterminate it, they must have thought of a strategy to some extent.

<b>

"However, my shikigami can only pinpoint a rough location. So please expect it to take at least a week to find the Ushi-Oni."

"…Hey, can you notify me immediately if you detect that youki?"

"Huh? Yes, that's possible, but..."

"Then let me know the results as soon as you detect it. Oh, here's my ID."

<b>

I write my call app ID on the back of the memo Kuon gave me this morning and hand it to her.

<b>

"Um, what are you planning to do?"

"What do you mean, it's obvious."

<b>

I gesture as if cutting my throat and respond.

<b>

"I'm going to take down this monster quickly. That's the plan, right?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the bustling nightlife district, two people, a man and a woman, walked closely together through a dimly lit alley illuminated only by faint neon lights.

<b>

"Hey, would you like to come to my place?"

"Is that really okay? With someone like me entering your room..."

"I'm saying this because it's you."

"Well, then..."

<b>

The middle-aged man in a suit, his face flushed from alcohol, happily accepted the unexpected invitation from the young beauty.

Seeing the man's reaction, the woman briefly displayed a beast-like expression before getting into a taxi that passed by.

<b>

"Uh, it seems we've come quite a distance...?"

<b>

The man felt uneasy as he noticed the scenery outside the taxi window had turned into a mountainous area with fields.

However, the woman did not respond at all and continued to gaze out the window.

<b>

Eventually, the taxi stopped in front of a small abandoned factory at the foot of the mountain.

<b>

"Um, Ms. Kijima, is this...?"

<b>

As the man turned to ask, the woman abruptly pushed him out of the taxi.

<b>

"W-What are you doing all of a sudden...?!"

<b>

As the man protested in surprise, his voice turned into a scream as a black hand suddenly reached out from the darkness.

He was dragged helplessly into the abandoned factory and roughly thrown inside.

<b>

Inside the factory, illuminated by the moonlight, something resembling a black shadow in human form was writhing.

<b>

"Ms. Kijima...? What is going on here...?"

"I'm sorry. I had to resort to this rough method because I couldn't get in touch with my subordinates."

"W-What are you...?"

<b>

As the man voiced his confusion, the woman, who had introduced herself as Kijima, chuckled and approached.

At that moment, the man finally understood.

That the shadow extending from the woman clearly did not take on a human form.

<b>

Faced with fear, the man was unable to move even a single finger.

Meanwhile, the woman—no, the thing that was once a woman—extended its hand towards him, transforming its shape.

<b>

And just as the distance closed to within one meter.

<b>

"…?"

<b>

The thing that was once a woman saw a shadow above its head.

Then, the window glass in the ceiling shattered, and something fell along with a rain of glass.

<b>

"?!"

<b>

The thing that was once a woman instinctively tried to distance itself from whatever it was, but it moved faster and closed the distance.

<b>

"…'Spatial Transfer Magic.'"

<b>

And in the next moment, everything—the thing that was once a woman and the writhing black shadow—vanished from the abandoned factory.
