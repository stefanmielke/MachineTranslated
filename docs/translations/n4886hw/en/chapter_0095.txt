# Chapter 91: One Trouble Gone 1

“Phew…”

<b>

Having landed on the ground, I took a breather while drinking the MP potion I created with 'Water Magic'.

By the time I touched down on the floor of the original layer, the great tree had completely vanished, leaving only a theater-like space shrouded in that red mist.

And most of that mist was already beginning to clear.

With this, searching for the control panel needed to escape this labyrinth shouldn’t be too much of a struggle.

<b>

(…No signs of enemies. The people who were drained of their power seem to be safe for now.)

<b>

But before that, I have some things to take care of.

<b>

I looked down at the thorny vine that was bound and unable to move, having been stopped by 'Healing Magic' and 'Ice Magic', and restrained by handcuffs and shackles created with 'Water Magic'.

<b>

“...You’re not going to finish me off? Are you trying to show mercy?”

“I have a question to ask first. Your treatment will be decided after that.”

“I see. Well, feel free to ask me anything. Whether I answer honestly is another matter, though?”

<b>

Even at this stage, she still maintains a seemingly relaxed attitude.

Is it just a bluff, or does she have some other trump card hidden away?

In any case, it’s best to be cautious while dealing with her.

<b>

“First question. Who wrote that invitation?”

“Did you not check the sender’s section? The invitation was undoubtedly written by Lord Kuon Sogen himself.”

“Are you seriously saying that old fool could write that letter?”

“If he’s in good health, I believe he could manage it.”

<b>

So she has no intention of answering honestly.

I thought she might be a bit more truthful after taking this much damage.

<b>

“Then for the next question. Are you affiliated with any organization?”

“It’s not a grand organization, but there are those I serve.”

<b>

Now she’s given a response that’s difficult to judge.

Serving someone, but it doesn’t seem to be for the purpose of seduction like with Kuon Sogen…

What kind of person could command such a monster?

<b>

…For now, I can assume this incident is not the work of a lone perpetrator.

<b>

“Third question. Were you the one who summoned the monster in the attic of the Kuon family mansion?”

“I will only say that I assisted in that matter.”

<b>

Assisted. So that means the one she serves, or someone closely related to them, summoned that creature?

<b>

<b>

“I see, then I’ll ask my final question.”

“Oh dear, I would prefer to talk more with you.”

“Sorry, but I’m not in the mood for that. I’ll get straight to the point. Are you human, or one of those monsters?”

“Neither. I am a doll created to resemble a human.”

<b>

In response to that question, she looked straight into my eyes, smiling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

Unlike her previous answers, she responded directly without any ambiguity, leaving me internally perplexed as I struggled to find words.

<b>

“Is ‘doll’ just a metaphor or something?”

“It’s meant literally. I was created like the shikigami of that mansion, given a mission to infiltrate the Kuon family.”

“What is that mission?”

“To offer you the arm of Ibaraki Doji that you took from my master.”

<b>

<b>

Unlike before, she answered my questions honestly, causing me to ponder deeply.

Is everything a lie, or did she answer truthfully because it’s information she doesn’t mind being known?

If only I could use 'Identification', I wouldn’t have to worry like this.

In any case, there’s nothing more to ask her. Or rather, there’s nothing more I can ask.

Moreover, according to the location information sent from the drone, Kyori is about to arrive here.

Then I should switch my priority from questioning to neutralizing her.

<b>

“Is that all your questions?”

“Yeah. I’ve mostly asked what I wanted to know. Whether I’m satisfied with the answers is another matter.”

“I see… Well, it’s a pity, but it seems we must part ways here.”

<b>

As she spoke, something like lightning erupted from her body.

As expected, she doesn’t seem inclined to be captured quietly.

<b>

“Well then, Iori-sama. Let’s meet again somewhere.”

“No, my dealings with you end here.”

<b>

As the lightning damaged the restraints, I spat that out at Ibara, who wore a triumphant smile.

At the same time, the restraints binding her limbs transformed into icy chains that robbed her body of heat, enveloping her completely.

<b>

“This is… I see, it’s meant to freeze my body. But this level of trickery won’t—”

“Yeah, that alone won’t seal you. So I set a trap.”

“...A trap, I see what you mean.”

<b>

Having understood the nature of the anomaly happening to her, or rather, the nature of my trap, Ibara placed a hand on her chest, murmuring as cold breath and frozen blood escaped her lips.

<b>

“You’ve embedded this ice chain within my body as well.”

“Correct. You’ll be frozen from both the inside and the outside, losing all freedom.”

<b>

When I used 'Ice Magic' to stop the bleeding, I had embedded an almost invisible wedge within her body as a precaution for a “what if” scenario.

The embedded wedge is designed to rapidly freeze her from the inside if she takes any hostile actions against me.

<b>

The effect manifests just like when I tested it on a water doll intricately modeled after the human body, and Ibara’s body began to freeze, her movements visibly slowing down.

<b>

“Ahaha, it seems this time I’m the one who’s lost.”

“...If you surrender quietly, I’ll spare your life. What do you say?”

“That’s a foolish question. A defective doll that cannot fulfill its mission has no value of existence… And—”

<b>

Despite her body being covered in ice, Ibara directed a calm smile at me.

<b>

“Dolls do not feel pain or fear, you know?”

<b>

And right after she said that to me, Ibara’s body was completely frozen as if time had stopped.
