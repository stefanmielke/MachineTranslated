# Intermission: Those Summoned to Another World 4

Fires were raging everywhere, and the battlefield was filled with a suffocating smell of blood.

<b>

“Ha… ha…”

<b>

In such a hellish place, the boy— a male student summoned from another world— was desperately running with a magic wand clutched in both hands.

His stamina was nearly depleted. His whole body screamed that it could not run any further.

Yet, the reason he continued to run was simply a very straightforward one: “I don’t want to die.”

<b>

“Gya gya gya!”

(It's here…!)

<b>

A horde of goblins stood in the boy's way.

Though he was overwhelmed with the urge to flee, he froze in place, terrified of the fate that awaited him if he did.

<b>

“Die, you who stand in my way! 'Fire Magic'!”

<b>

The boy recited the incantation deemed necessary to activate his magic skill and launched a fireball at the goblin horde.

<b>

“Gya, gya gya!?”

“Gyaah!”

<b>

The fireball ignited the hair and clothing of a large goblin at the front, which it had likely stolen from someone in a nearby town, causing it to writhe on the ground.

The fire spread to the surrounding goblins due to the actions of that hobgoblin.

In the end, what remained was a pile of charred corpses of the little demons, emitting nauseating smoke.

<b>

“I-I did it…! Right, I need to check my 'Status'…”

<b>

The boy, feeling joy at his achievement, tried to view his current status.

<b>

If he had leveled up to 40 or above, he would no longer have to be ordered to hunt such weaklings.

So please, let those goblins provide enough experience points.

<b>

With that wish deep in his heart, he cautiously peeked at his status.

<b>

“Fukutani Tomoya, Level 37, Human”

<b>

The level indicated on the status was 37; he had been level 36 when thrown into this battlefield, so he had indeed leveled up.

However, this was a mere drop in the bucket compared to what the boy, Fukutani Tomoya, had hoped for.

<b>

(I can't level up enough in today's battle to be exempt from that. Then I have to achieve as much as I can—)

<b>

Having recovered his MP and stamina from leveling up, Fukutani looked around and set his sights on a solitary spear-wielding male student who had also been summoned to this world and was cornering a hobgoblin.

Just at that moment, when the male student was about to stab the hobgoblin in the head with his spear.

<b>

“Die, you who stand in my way! 'Fire Magic'!”

“What…!?”

<b>

Fukutani, aiming to steal the male student's glory, hurled a fireball at the hobgoblin.

Since the male student had already depleted some of its health, the hobgoblin fell to the ground from that single blow.

<b>

“Hey, you! You stole my prey!”

“I just attacked because I found an enemy! Do you have any proof that I stole your prey!?”

<b>

The male student was furious at Fukutani's actions and lunged at him, but Fukutani retorted, “Do you have any proof?”

The male student tried to find “students who had been watching the battle” to argue back, but as Fukutani had planned, there was no one nearby.

<b>

“W-Well! What are you going to do!? Are you going to tell them I interfered without any basis!? Or are you going to stab me with that spear!? You know what will happen if you do that, right…?”

“D-Damn it!”

<b>

The spear-wielding male student slammed his spear down near Fukutani's toes in frustration and walked away.

Once he saw that, Fukutani collapsed to the ground as if the tension had snapped.

<b>

(I-I’ve achieved this much. I can take a little break, right…?)

<b>

Fukutani moved to a nearby rock to catch his breath and waited for the sound that would signal the end of this battle.

<b>

“Spirit of Light, grant power to my sword! [Heavenly Holy Slash]!”

<b>

The voice of [Hero] Amagi Seiya echoed throughout the battlefield via a loudspeaker magic tool, and a golden holy sword shone at the innermost part of the demon king's army's stronghold.

<b>

Fukutani watched the series of events and let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

(So the battle is over, huh? This time I managed to achieve results… Two hobgoblins and one horde of goblins; with this, I should be exempted from the next battle, right…?)

<b>

It was likely, no, it was certain that the high-ranking demon who had led the demon king's army had been defeated by Amagi.

The remnants should be dealt with by the kingdom's knight order.

<b>

Fukutani drank the fatigue recovery potion provided to him and began to walk back to their base, using his magic wand for support.

<b>

“You got in my way—!”

“Don’t mess with me! You’re the one!”

“You! How dare you steal my achievement!”

“What!? Don’t throw baseless accusations at me!?”

<b>

Along the way, he could hear the curses of the summoned students echoing from all around the battlefield.

Fukutani felt nothing towards that sight, which had become so familiar and tiresome.

Right now, he was thinking of two things.

He wanted to return to the base quickly and dive into bed to recover his energy, and he wished to avoid running into the spear-wielding male student he had just stolen the prey from. That was all.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

“Seiya-sama, you achieved a splendid victory again this time!”

<b>

Amagi, who had been summoned from a certain town and forced to obey with magic tools, landed in the square at the center of their base on a pegasus, greeted by Priscilla, who wore the same innocent smile as when they first met.

In response, Amagi shyly smiled and replied.

<b>

“Not at all. This was all thanks to everyone taking care of the weaklings.”

“There's no need to be so modest, Seiya. It was you who made those who had become useless due to cowardice useful again.”

“That's right. We were able to show our strength because Seiya came up with a brilliant idea.”

“Rin, and everyone…”

<b>

The main force led by Kayama Rin, who returned riding a dragon, also praised Seiya and the brilliant idea he had thought of.

<b>

“By the way, how many people managed to meet their quotas in this battle?”

“Fukutani-san and Inoue-san. Fukutani-san succeeded in defeating two hobgoblins, and Inoue-san reached level 40, showing loyalty comparable to that of the auxiliary troops.”

“Understood. Then let’s promote those two from the front-line troops to the auxiliary troops. And how many people did not meet their quotas in the auxiliary troops?”

“Ten people; all of them achieved only minimal results compared to their levels and achievements in the front-line troops.”

“Then let’s have those people work hard from scratch in the front-line troops.”

“Understood. I will convey that.”

<b>

Priscilla bowed and then gave instructions to her escort knights.

<b>

The brilliant idea that Amagi had come up with was to forcibly assign those lacking in level, ability, and loyalty to Amagi to the front-line troops to hunt weaklings, preserving the strength of Amagi and the main force.

There were two ways to escape from the front-line troops.

Either achieve results on the battlefield or demonstrate loyalty after reaching half the current level of [Hero] Amagi Seiya.

Those who escaped from the front-line troops would be promoted to the auxiliary troops and allowed a safer life, but if they stopped achieving results there and were deemed lacking in loyalty to Amagi, they would be sent back to the front-line troops.

Of course, anyone who dared to object would find Amagi's holy sword wielded against them.

In short, it was a system reflecting Amagi Seiya's meritocratic ideology.

<b>

Now, back to the main topic.

<b>

“Hey, Seiya. Since we’re here, why don’t we quietly have a victory celebration together?”

“W-Wait, Rin!”

<b>

As if waiting for Priscilla to leave, Rin clung to Amagi's right arm and whispered in a sweet voice.

<b>

“Oh my, how bold of you to sneak in like this.”

<b>

Noticing what was happening behind her, Priscilla clung to Amagi's other arm to keep Rin in check.

<b>

(…Damn it, why do I have to see this?)

<b>

Meanwhile, Fukutani, who had finally made it back to the base, watched this with disgust while finishing the water in his canteen.

While they, the bottom-tier group, were fighting for survival and hurling insults at each other, those at the top of the school caste were playing out a nauseating romantic drama.

Could anything be more frustrating than this?

<b>

(…Damn it!)

<b>

Fukutani suppressed the urge to lash out at something and returned to the tent assigned to him.

He held onto his anger towards the existence that had summoned him to this world and the resentment of why he had to endure such a situation.

<b>

This was the utterly ordinary daily life of the students of Class 2-B.
