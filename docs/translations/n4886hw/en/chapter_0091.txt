# Chapter 87: The Decisive Battle Begins 2

"Are you really okay?"

"Yes. It's thanks to Iori-kun's treatment."

<b>

While climbing the icy stairs, I look back at Kyori, who is running behind me.

Perhaps the effects of the 'Healing Magic' are starting to show, her complexion has improved significantly compared to when we first met.

<b>

"…And I'm sorry. I didn't mean to get you involved in this."

"You don't have to worry about it. I was the one who got us into this mess."

"I'm glad to hear you say that. Um, why is Iori-kun—"

<b>

Just as Kyori was about to say something, a loud 'crack' sound echoes from behind us.

<b>

"Hey, no way...!?"

<b>

Then, a powerful sound like something smashing against the floor follows.

When I look down, I see branches violently trying to break the ice that has frozen the water with 'Ice Magic.'

<b>

"Hands!"

"Y-Yes!"

<b>

I grab Kyori's hand and use the minimum output of 'Wind Magic' along with a jump to dash up the icy stairs.

Meanwhile, behind us, branches that emerged from the cracked ice are stretching out countless tendrils towards us.

<b>

"Ugh, raahhh!"

<b>

I pull Kyori close and unleash the minimum output of 'Wind Magic' as I leap forward.

<b>

I must have jumped several hundred meters.

We successfully dove into that crack in the center of the trunk.

<b>

"Hah... Hah... This is really tough..."

<b>

For a moment, my vision darkens, but I manage to endure it and turn my gaze to Kyori.

<b>

"Are you okay, Kyori?"

"Ah, um, yes! I'm completely fine!"

"That's good to hear. And I'm sorry for suddenly pulling you close."

"N-No! You don't have to worry about that at all!"

<b>

She blushes for a moment and then hides her face with her arm.

<b>

...I don't quite understand, but it seems Kyori is okay for now.

<b>

"…Alright."

<b>

I take a moment to catch my breath and start searching for that shadow with Kyori.

That said, there are no other people in the crack besides us, and all I can see are some rail-like structures extending in all directions.

<b>

It seems we'll have to search on foot.

<b>

"I want to confirm something, but what kind of tactics do you think Kuon Genji will use?"

"…That person preferred to use explosive-type shikigami for brute force. However, I honestly can't predict what kind of moves he will make in this situation."

<b>

Well, that makes sense.

Then our priority now should be to prepare ourselves thoroughly.

<b>

In that case.

<b>

('Water Magic')

<b>

As I think that, a palm-sized green water sphere appears in the air.

At the same time, a severe headache and nausea hit me mercilessly.

<b>

"Ugh...!?"

"Iori-kun!?"

"I'm fine. I'm fine..."

<b>

I manage to stop Kyori's worried expression with my hand and, steeling myself, I gulp down the green water sphere in front of me in one breath.

<b>

―――

<b>

I suspect that at the point I used 'Water Magic,' my MP was almost depleted.

I didn't completely recover, but if I managed to recover nearly half of my MP in this critical moment, that's quite good.

<b>

(And it was really a gamble whether it would succeed or not)

<b>

Having used 'Water Magic' many times before, I had a faint feeling.

This skill, despite having 'Water' in its name, might actually allow me to generate 'Liquid' freely.

Thinking that, I repeatedly generated modified drones until I became convinced, and I attempted to create a new liquid... a liquid that does not exist in this world, which resulted in the green water sphere I just created, the 'MP Recovery Potion.'

<b>

<b>

"Um, what was that just now...?"

"Ah, it's like a universal recovery potion just for me? Anyway, let's hurry and find that shadow."

"Ah..."

<b>

I quickly dismiss Kyori's anxious gaze and close the status screen, then resume our search.

<b>

(I can now use some flashy skills, but the fatigue doesn't go away. This must be the difference from a full MP recovery during a level-up.)

<b>

...Just to be safe, I should cast 'Healing Magic' on myself.

As I think this, Kyori suddenly darts forward.

<b>

"What's wrong? Did you spot that shadow?"

"No, I just saw something moving at an incredible speed... like a ball..."

<b>

A ball? Just as I was about to ask back, I realize something is approaching us from behind with a loud noise.

<b>

('Ice Magic'!)

<b>

I immediately create an ice wall and slowly turn around while remaining cautious.

<b>

"Is this what Kyori saw?"

"I think it's probably this."

<b>

After confirming, I look at the ball.

It appears to be a sphere formed by branches and roots intricately intertwined, and it seems to be storing a considerable amount of red liquid inside.

<b>

('Appraisal')

<b>

――――

<b>

Target: Root-Type Spiritual Energy Supply Technique

Effect: Delivers the energy needed for enhancement to the target person located at the deepest part while moving through the tree.

The routes are fixed for each.

Note: The current target person is Kuon Genji.

Additionally, the target is currently immobilized by 'Ice Magic.'

<b>

――――

<b>

Oh, this is good information to have.

With this 'Appraisal' result, if I do this and that...

<b>

"Did you find out anything?"

"Well, a few things. By the way, Kyori, are you good with roller coasters?"

"Yes?"
