# Episode 93: A Trouble Passed - 3

“Hey! Outside! We can get outside!”

“Ah, thank goodness…! I won’t have to suffer anymore…!”

<b>

When I came to, I was sitting in the vast backyard of the Kuon family mansion, in the viewing seats that had been built there.

Looking at the faces of the people sitting around me, it seemed I had been forcibly returned to the place I was before being trapped in the barrier.

It also appeared that my physical condition had returned to what it was before being trapped in the barrier.

In fact, several people nearby had been dried up like mummies by that giant tree-like thing in the maze barrier, but now they were completely normal, healthy humans.

<b>

Around me, those who had been caught in that barrier were joyfully crying tears of relief at having escaped safely.

While watching such a scene, I opened my smartphone.

The purpose was to check the current time.

<b>

(…7:22, it’s only been about an hour since I was woken up at a little past 6)

<b>

Come to think of it, the barrier we were trapped in during the school camp had a different flow of time inside and outside.

I wonder if that maze barrier had a similar effect.

<b>

(Oh, right. I need to check if Kiyori and the others made it back safely…)

“Damn it! Don’t mess with me! Don’t mess with me!? Because of you, because of you, my plan is ruined!”

<b>

Suddenly, I heard an angry voice coming from the altar in the center of the courtyard.

Looking over, I saw Kuon Genji, clearly irritated, confronting Kiyori with an intensity that suggested he was about to lash out.

<b>

“If you and that worthless outsider hadn’t meddled, I would have become the head of the Kuon family! And yet…!”

<b>

Saying that, Kuon Genji trembled with anger as he took an amulet from his pocket.

<b>

“It’s your fault, Kiyori. This is what happens when you disregard my mercy!”

“Sister!”

<b>

As Kuon Genji finished speaking, the amulet ignited into a pale blue flame and wrapped around his right fist.

Seeing that, Koharu from the viewing seats rushed towards Kiyori, but no one else followed.

Perhaps the fear they experienced in the barrier still lingered; in any case, it seemed no one else had the will to help Kiyori.

<b>

“…”

<b>

On the other hand, Kiyori faced Kuon Genji’s hatred without flinching, silently staring straight at his face.

<b>

“Damn it!”

<b>

Perhaps irritated by that, Kuon Genji raised his eyebrows and attempted to smash his flame-wrapped fist down on Kiyori—but――.

<b>

“W-What the hell…!”

<b>

His fist never struck Kiyori; instead, it was absorbed into my hand, which had been teleported there using “Spatial Transfer Magic.”

I grabbed Kuon Genji’s fist and twisted his arm up.

<b>

“Ugh, outsider! Do you even know what you’re doing!”

<b>

Kuon Genji grimaced in pain, spitting as he shouted.

<b>

“I just stopped a thug from hitting an unresisting girl. That’s all.”

“―――!”

<b>

Hearing that, Kuon Genji became even more enraged, increasing the temperature of the flames around his hand and attempting to forcibly break free from my grip.

However, the temperature transmitted to my hand was only about as warm as a hot pack, not enough to cause any damage.

Now, should I tighten my grip on his arm a bit more?

<b>

“Guh, aaahhh!?”

<b>

Perhaps the adrenaline from being in the barrier had dulled his pain.

Kuon Genji opened his mouth and eyes wide, letting out a scream.

<b>

Yeah, that should give him a suitable amount of pain.

Now, I was about to activate the “insurance” I had set up when―――.

<b>

“Iori-kun, could you please let go of that hand?”

<b>

Suddenly, Kiyori placed her hand on my arm, asking me to release him.

<b>

“No, but…”

“Please. Let me settle this with him.”

<b>

Kiyori’s expression, as she said she wanted to settle things, was completely serious.

――If she said that, I had no choice but to comply.

<b>

Reluctantly, I released the arm I had been gripping, and Kuon Genji rubbed his right arm while glaring at Kiyori with an expression of deep displeasure.

<b>

“……What do you intend to do, Kiyori?”

“I challenge you to a duel right here. The one who knocks out the opponent first wins, using no outside help, and the loser must obey the winner. How about it?”

“You want to duel me? Why should I do something like that――”

“Could it be that, after saying all those bold words, you lack the confidence to win against someone like me?”

“……If you’re going that far, fine. I’ll do it. I’ll make sure you can never speak so arrogantly again!”

<b>

Kuon Genji, seemingly taken aback by Kiyori’s provocation, stepped back and pulled out a large number of talismans from his pocket.

In contrast, Kiyori stood there unarmed, still in a non-resistant state.

<b>

“Are you planning to hold back just because my arm is injured?”

“No, I just thought this would be enough against you.”

“You’re underestimating me… Don’t complain later if you regret it!”

<b>

Kuon Genji shouted, summoning countless beast-shaped shikigami and fireballs to attack Kiyori.

However.

<b>

“…………Huh?”

<b>

The spirits he summoned couldn’t maintain their form and collapsed in an instant.

Seeing that, Kiyori sighed in disbelief and cast a contemptuous glance at the confused Kuon Genji.

<b>

“Didn’t you receive support from that person, Ibara-san, while performing your techniques?”

“W-Why do you know that…?”

“You were about to unleash fire on me and him, but that was the same as what someone who just started learning techniques would produce. To be honest, I didn’t think someone who manipulated that many techniques inside the barrier could produce that. And upon reflection, all the techniques you used were powerful, but they were all things a beginner would use.”

“……”

<b>

<b>

As Kiyori spoke calmly, she slowly closed the distance between herself and the collapsing Kuon Genji.

<b>

“That’s why I thought, perhaps you were relying on Ibara-san’s help to appear stronger than you really are without training.”

“W-What’s wrong with that!? It’s only natural for a master to use the power of their subordinates! Besides, you were using the power of that worthless outsider too!”

“――Yes, relying on others. Depending on people. That in itself isn’t a bad thing. However—”

<b>

Standing in front of Kuon Genji, Kiyori declared―――.

<b>

“Being able to rely on others doesn’t justify neglecting your own efforts.”

“Gyaah!?”

<b>

With a magnificent throw, she slammed Kuon Genji to the ground.

The impact seemed to knock him out again, as his body twitched occasionally, but he showed no signs of trying to get up.

According to the “Appraisal,” it seemed he was just unconscious and not in any danger, so I could leave that alone.

The problem was…….

<b>

“O-oh! As expected of Kiyori-sama!”

“W-we believed that if it were Kiyori-sama, she could handle that scum all by herself!”

“Kiyori-sama is truly the one worthy of being the next head of the Kuon family, so please, we…”

<b>

Seeing that scene, the members of the Kuon family who had been watching from the viewing seats showered Kiyori with words of praise, as if they had flipped a switch.

However, Kiyori didn’t even glance at the members of the Kuon family, who were desperately trying to make excuses and curry favor, and returned to us.

<b>

“……I’m truly sorry for the trouble I caused.”

<b>

She bowed deeply and then went back inside the mansion.

<b>

(This seems like it could lead to another trouble…)

<b>

Having firmly concluded that after witnessing the series of events, I activated the “insurance” on the unconscious Kuon Genji and followed after her.
