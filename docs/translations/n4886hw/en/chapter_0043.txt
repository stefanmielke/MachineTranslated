# Intermission: Those Summoned to Another World 3

"All personnel, assemble at the training ground."

<b>

On the early morning of a rest day, the students, who were abruptly awakened by the knight in charge, rubbed their eyes as they lined up at the training ground.

In the lineup, those with excellent grades stood in the front row, while those deemed to have poor grades and misconduct were placed in the back row.

To put it simply, those favored by Amagi were around him, while those not favored were pushed to the back row.

<b>

"…Hey, do you know why we were gathered?"

"…No idea. Maybe someone broke something?"

<b>

As the students whispered various speculations, the knight suddenly took out a trumpet and began to blow it.

At the same time, the luxurious doors of the viewing area, which had never been opened before at the top of the training ground, creaked as they opened against the stone-paved floor.

<b>

"All personnel, salute His Majesty the King!"

<b>

Having been drilled into them to the point of trauma during the first week of being summoned, the students almost reflexively complied with the command.

Then, belatedly, the students began to stir as they realized the knight had referred to "His Majesty the King."

<b>

"Ah, good, good. Everyone, please relax."

<b>

From behind the door appeared a plump old man walking with a cane, accompanied by Priscilla.

His name was Salus El Sentiel VIII. He was the king of the last human nation, the Sentiel Kingdom, and also the supreme commander of the human army, making him the most important figure for humanity.

<b>

Salus VIII sat down in a particularly luxurious viewing seat and gestured for Priscilla to step forward.

<b>

"Brave ones. Thank you for your long and arduous training."

<b>

Priscilla said this while looking at all the students and bowed deeply.

Then, glancing at the face of the [Hero] Seiya Amagi standing in the front row, she smiled briefly before raising her face with a serious expression to continue speaking.

<b>

"The monster subjugation in the underground labyrinth and the group combat training against the knights. Those of you who have accomplished all of this have undoubtedly become the finest knights to protect humanity."

(…Ah, I see. So it finally begins.)

<b>

Perhaps sensing the true meaning of Priscilla's words quickly, Rin Kayama smiled and waited for her to continue.

<b>

"---As of today, all training is complete. You will be departing for the town of Trut, which is currently under attack by the Demon King's army."

<b>

After a moment of silence, Amagi drew the shining golden holy sword from its sheath and raised it toward Salus VIII and Priscilla.

<b>

"Understood, Princess Priscilla. We, the heroes, will now march to the town of Trut to save humanity!"

"「「「Uooooooh!」」」"

<b>

In response to Amagi's words, those who idolized him in the front row cheered loudly.

On the other hand, those in the back row who had opposed Amagi or had been declared unfit early on looked on with resentment at the scene.

<b>

"…So only the front row was informed, huh?"

"…Probably. Damn it, it's infuriating."

"…Hey, don't shout too loudly. What if the front row hears us—"

<b>

Ignoring them, Salus VIII stood up with Priscilla's assistance and cast a creepy smile as he glanced at the summoned students.

<b>

"Then, I look forward to your efforts. Hero."

"---Ha! Leave everything to me."

<b>

After saying this to Amagi, the old king disappeared behind the door.

<b>

While the students in the back row were puzzled by the meaning of their exchanged words, Amagi smiled as usual and said:

<b>

"Well then, everyone, let's set off."

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ugh…"

<b>

One of the students crouched down and vomited what was in his stomach under the shade of a tree.

As they approached the town of Trut, the remnants of the road resembled a hellish scene.

<b>

Surrounding a wagon that had likely been packed with as many belongings as possible while fleeing from the Demon King's army were the decomposing bodies of its owner and their family, and nearby lay the corpse of a horse that was presumably pulling the wagon.

<b>

And 50 meters ahead, there was the body of a man who had turned to stone with an expression of horror, and another 50 meters beyond that was a group of what appeared to be humans, their bodies charred black, reaching out toward the students.

<b>

"Damn…! What the hell is this!?"

"No way…! I want to go home…!"

<b>

The sight sent the students in the back row into a state of nausea, tears in their eyes, pleading to return.

Meanwhile, the front row, including Amagi, remained unfazed, observing the burning town and the rampaging Demon King's army.

<b>

"It seems we were a step too late."

"But judging by the flames, it appears the Demon King's army is still in the town of Trut."

"Then it's our chance. Let's take down those cocky bastards right here!"

"Yes, we can't let them escape."

<b>

After discussing with Priscilla and those particularly close to him, Amagi turned his gaze toward the trembling students in the back row.

Then, with his usual smile, he pointed at one of the male students.

<b>

"Hey, could you run into that town to lure out the Demon King's army?"

"…Huh, me?"

<b>

The designated male student appeared flustered, either unable to understand what Amagi meant or unwilling to accept it.

<b>

"Y-you mean me?"

"Yes. You have the skill 'High-Speed Movement,' right? If you get spotted by the enemy, you can escape quickly."

"B-but, escaping alone against those enemies is…"

"---I see, so you mean to say my plan is flawed?"

<b>

At Amagi's words, the male student's face froze in fear.

<b>

"N-no! That's not what I meant—"

"Is that so? This morning, you were talking behind my back, right? So I thought you were one of those who challenged me to a duel."

"N-no! I would never! I would never speak ill of you, Amagi-sama!"

<b>

The male student clung to Amagi's feet, desperately trying to explain.

But Amagi's gaze toward the male student did not change.

<b>

"Hmm, even if you say that, I can't trust you without evidence."

"Evidence…?"

"Yes. Unless you show me proof that you’re not thinking of breaking our bond, no matter how much you talk, I can't trust you."

<b>

Saying this, Amagi looked down at the male student with a cold gaze, despite the smile on his face.

<b>

"W-what can I do to earn your trust…?"

"That's simple."

<b>

Amagi drew the golden holy sword from its sheath and pointed the tip toward the burning town of Trut.

<b>

"As I just said, run into that town alone and lure out the Demon King's army. If you do that, I will trust you."

"Y-yes…"

<b>

With no escape route left, the male student, perhaps realizing this, hung his head and weakly replied, "I understand."

<b>

At those words, Amagi smiled a different smile, one that seemed to come from the heart.
