# Episode 65: A Hero's Aspirant's Recollection

I have admired the heroes on television since I was little.

I was so envious of their figures, who continued to fight without ever yielding, no matter how vicious the villains or monsters they faced.

<b>

But that was always just a story on television.

The reality of me—Masayuki Kato—is that I am an utterly ordinary person, far removed from being a hero.

<b>

When problems arise, I throw the resolution of those problems to someone else, and when faced with a situation where I must choose between the majority or the minority, I unhesitatingly side with the majority, hiding my love for heroes and trying to maintain a decent social life by following trends that I have no interest in.

In other words, I was nothing more than a truly boring person, far removed from being a hero, someone who could be found anywhere.

<b>

Yes, until that day.

<b>

<b>

"Brave warriors and their companions, welcome. My name is Priscilla El Sentiel. I am the first princess of the last remaining human nation in this world, the Sentiel Kingdom, and a holy maiden blessed by the summoning goddess, Ashera."

<b>

A magnificent temple, something I had only seen in manga, anime, or fantasy-themed special effects shows.

In the grand hall, a breathtakingly beautiful girl in a blue dress bowed her head and spoke to us, who had been gathered there, something that appeared to be of considerable value even to the untrained eye.

<b>

Yes, by some twist of fate, all 25 students of class 2-B who were in that classroom on the last school day before summer vacation were summoned as heroes and their companions to save a world on the brink of destruction.

<b>

I don't know how the other students felt, but at that moment, I experienced an excitement and exhilaration I had never felt before.

<b>

I had the opportunity to become special. I could become the hero I had admired on television since childhood.

<b>

I thought that, but still, reality was not so sweet.

<b>

<b>

"O all-powerful god, let judgment's thunder strike him. 'Thunderbolt Magic.'"

"Ugh...!?"

<b>

Once again today, someone who defied Amagi was swiftly defeated by his most proficient 'Thunderbolt Magic.'

<b>

"I guess I win. So, I would appreciate your continued cooperation from here on out."

<b>

I could only watch in fear from behind a pillar as Amagi said that and left the scene.

<b>

Ah, that's right. Even if summoned to another world and granted special powers, an ordinary person can only remain ordinary.

Only those who are waiting for everything—like Seiya Amagi—can become special beings.

<b>

Soon after being summoned to this other world, we underwent something called an 'aptitude test.'

<b>

It was meant to determine which stats were likely to grow, what skills could be learned, and what skills we already possessed. However, the skills I owned were 'Blacksmithing' and 'Design,' which were quite common in this world, and my stats were nothing particularly outstanding for combat.

This type of test result indicated that not only I but roughly 20% of the class were diagnosed as not suited for combat.

All we could do was support the combat personnel, or rather, handle menial tasks.

And then...

<b>

"Also, Kato-kun. This sword has become dull, so please maintain it."

"Y-Yes! Understood!"

<b>

After saying that, Amagi handed me a sword for mock battles and headed towards Rin Kayama and Princess Priscilla.

<b>

Those of us without the talent for fighting, or those who had fallen behind in training, secured our livelihoods by fawning over Amagi.

I told myself it was something necessary to survive, turning a blind eye to Amagi's tyranny over those who resisted him.

How could I even think about "admiring heroes" while doing something like this?

<b>

As I self-deprecatingly carried the sword towards my room and workshop...

<b>

"Excuse me, you there."

"Yes?"

<b>

When I was suddenly called out, I turned around to find a woman dressed like a fortune teller, with half of her face concealed by a black mask.

<b>

"You seem to be harboring great dissatisfaction and frustration in this world."

"Uh, what are you talking about? I need to fix Amagi's sword quickly..."

"You're really just irritated and frustrated, aren't you? While you admire heroes, in reality, you're complicit in wrongdoing. You tell yourself that you can't survive any other way, but despite having experienced the special event of being summoned to another world, you're still just an ordinary person."

<b>

The woman dressed like a fortune teller pointed out the causes of my dissatisfaction and frustration, seemingly reveling in her superiority as she chuckled.

<b>

"So what was I supposed to do!? Against Amagi, who surpasses me in physique and ability in every way!?"

<b>

I couldn't help but grab the shoulder of the fortune teller-like woman and shout angrily.

<b>

"You couldn't do anything. You are bound to one world."

<b>

The fortune teller-like woman replied without losing her nonchalant demeanor, and then she offered me a ring and something resembling a crystal.

<b>

"...What is that?"

"This ring is a magic item that allows you to move to another world. However, the only worlds you can go to are those you have been to before, and it will disappear after one use."

"So you want me to quietly return to my original world alone using that!? Even if I did that, it wouldn't solve anything—"

"The important part is this crystal. As long as you possess it, you can use skills in that other world just like here, and it will also replenish the magic power needed to activate those skills."

<b>

I can use skills in that world too?

If that's true...

<b>

"I will give these to you. How you use them is up to you."

"W-Why are you giving this to someone like me...? What do you want me to do...?"

"I want to see you shine. That's all I desire."

<b>

With that, she chuckled again and seemed to dissolve into the darkness.

<b>

Left alone, I looked at the ring and crystal in my palm and thought.

Staying in this world would change nothing; I would still be Mob A, complicit in wrongdoing.

Then I will—!

<b>

"Ah!"

<b>

As I put on the ring, my vision suddenly distorted.

—And in the next moment.

<b>

"...I really made it back."

<b>

I found myself standing in a familiar part of that residential area.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

Back in my original world, I headed straight to the abandoned mountain hut in the back mountains to think about what to do next.

First, quietly going home is out of the question.

Next, I could actually use my abilities and skills to sell myself to the country at a high price. But that carries a high risk of being treated like a guinea pig, so that's out.

So the last option left is—.

<b>

"Let's create it. A secret organization for me, by me, and just for me...!"

<b>

From there, my actions were swift.

First, I used the 'Blacksmithing' and 'Design' skills, which had been deemed dull and useless in that other world, to create a hero suit modeled after the hero from that special effects show I had idealized.

Of course, it wasn't just a cosplay outfit.

It was equipped with mechanisms to prevent identification, could be donned and doffed in an instant, and possessed the same combat abilities as in the original series.

<b>

Wearing the hero suit, I occasionally defeated villains and worked during the day on constructing the aerial fortress that appeared as a base in that special effects show.

<b>

One day, while living this secretive life, I encountered yet another turning point.

<b>

"Please! Grant me the power to fight! I want to be a shield to protect someone, just like you!"

<b>

One night, a girl I had saved from a villain pleaded with me like that.

<b>

She recognized my power. She affirmed what I was doing.

Drunk on that pleasant feeling, I foolishly responded.

<b>

"Very well. As the sacred hero returned from another world, I shall grant you power."

<b>

This marked the beginning of the Super Rescue Squad and my end.

<b>

<b>

The newly established Super Rescue Squad operated under the motto of "Helping the weak and defeating the strong," solely engaging in activities to punish those who committed wrongdoing.

<b>

However, humans are terrifying creatures, and I found myself unable to be satisfied with merely defeating villains.

So, I installed a kind of brainwashing mechanism in all the hero suits, making it so that rescuers would seek out hero suits, increasing the number of followers who praised me, and I introduced a points system to further enhance loyalty.

Moreover, I granted a sense of exhilaration and forgetfulness to anyone who saw my figure while wearing the suit.

Thus, my modest secret organization transformed into a kingdom centered around me.

<b>

However, here in Japan, there aren't many villains like in that other world.

<b>

That's why I resorted to such means.

<b>

I would indiscriminately label anyone with even a slightly delinquent appearance as a villain, employing such a grotesque method.
