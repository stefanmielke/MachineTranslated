# Chapter 119: I Decided to Introduce My Sister 1

"I'm sorry. After discussing it, I've decided to decline yesterday's offer."

<b>

The next morning, after arriving at school, I immediately went to see Teacher Koshimizu and declined to cooperate in capturing Alicia.

<b>

"…I see, that's unfortunate."

<b>

Thanks to choosing the teacher's room, which is filled with people unrelated to abilities or the occult, Teacher Koshimizu quietly backed down.

<b>

"Well then, excuse me."

"Yes. If you change your mind again, please don't hesitate to talk to me."

"…I'll think about it."

<b>

After saying that and bowing, I left the staff room and let out a big sigh.

I didn't want to burden Kyori unnecessarily and wanted to direct the hate solely towards myself, so I sent Kyori a message saying, "Leave it to me," and reported back like that, but this is tough in its own way...

<b>

"Hey, isn't that Shu? It's rare to see you in the staff room. Did you do something bad?"

"I didn't do anything. What about you? Didn't you come here to get scolded?"

"No way! I just came to buy a drink because I'm thirsty!"

<b>

Saying that, Rentaro showed me a can of cola and immediately opened it to start drinking.

<b>

"I see. So you haven't been caught doing anything that would get you scolded yet."

"Damn, you don't trust me at all."

"More importantly, HR is starting soon. Let's head back to the classroom."

"Okay, okay."

<b>

Saying that, Rentaro and I started walking towards the classroom while chatting about trivial things.

Then, at that moment.

<b>

"Hey, is there a teacher like that at this school?"

"Huh? What's up?"

"Look over there. We didn't have a teacher like that at our school, right?"

<b>

Rentaro stopped drinking his cola and pointed at a few men and women in suits who were chatting with the head teacher in front of the staff room.

For a moment, I thought they were student teachers, but since some of them seemed older than the head teacher of this school, my assumption was likely wrong.

So who are those people...?

<b>

"Oh, right. They're the middle school teachers coming with us for the social studies field trip."

<b>

At that, Rentaro nodded as if he understood.

<b>

"Huh? Why are middle school teachers coming for a social studies field trip?"

"Shu, don't you remember what the teacher said yesterday? This year, we're doing a joint social studies field trip with the second-year students from ■■ Middle School."

<b>

Reminded by Rentaro, I finally recalled.

Oh, right. By coincidence, our school's and ■■ Middle School's field trip destinations overlapped, and after some discussion, it was decided to do a joint trip.

The official reason was supposedly to "instill a sense of responsibility in high school students and encourage middle school students to think more deeply about their futures."

Well, it was probably just something decided on the spot.

<b>

"Just the thought of having to manage a group is annoying, and now I have to take care of middle school students too..."

"Yeah, I might catch a cold and skip it, so do your best if that happens."

"Hey. Our group is already struggling without Alicia, so don't you dare skip out on the day."

"Okay, okay, I got it!"

<b>

I grabbed Rentaro's shoulders, who boldly declared he would skip, and told him with a bit of pressure that I wouldn't let him escape.

Rentaro declared he wouldn't skip while sweating nervously, so I let it go for now.

<b>

(…Still, second-year students from ■■ Middle School—I'm going to be in the same school event as Kana and the others. Is there something going on here?)

It's quite unusual for our field trip destinations to coincide by chance and for it to be decided to do a joint trip. I can't help but suspect that this situation was somehow orchestrated by Teacher Koshimizu or the organization Alicia belonged to.

…For now, it might be best to stay on guard.

<b>

"Hey, why are you suddenly stopping and zoning out?"

"Uh, I was just thinking how I want to get home and relax."

<b>

I casually replied to Rentaro and started walking towards the classroom again.

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

"To reiterate, next Wednesday's social studies field trip will be a joint trip with ■■ Middle School, where we will board the marine research vessel of ○○ Prefectural University and have a look at the facilities. Everyone, please keep in mind that you are to set an example for the middle school students who will be your juniors in the future. Now, please split into your respective groups and begin your tasks."

<b>

During the afternoon LHR in preparation for the field trip, Teacher Koshimizu looked around at us and said that while starting to distribute handouts.

Today's LHR aims to assign roles for group activities like creating route maps and taking notes.

However, before that, our group has something we need to do.

<b>

"…Um, does anyone want to be the group leader in place of Alicia?"

<b>

I mustered my courage to say that, and everyone except Kyori simultaneously averted their eyes from me.

Seeing the reactions of the group members, I thought, "Well, I expected that," and turned my gaze back to the handout.

In this joint social studies field trip, the group leader will also be responsible for guiding the middle school students.

The teachers from their side will likely be keeping an eye on things, but the fact remains that it adds more work. Honestly, I absolutely don't want to be the group leader.

Alicia would have handled that part well, but there's no point in relying on someone who's not here.

<b>

"How about we decide by drawing lots like we did for the camp school?"

<b>

At that, Kobayashi made that suggestion.

It might be an option to leave it entirely to chance, but...

<b>

"But Kobayashi, this time the group leader's job is different from the camp school; there's a lot to do and responsibilities, so it would be better to choose someone properly..."

"Yeah, that's true..."

<b>

When Uejima said that, Kobayashi fell silent.

Indeed, if it were just us, it might be fine to randomly assign roles by drawing lots, but since we have to take care of completely unfamiliar middle school students, we should choose someone properly.

<b>

"That means we need to choose someone from these four who can manage everyone as the group leader."

"Hey? Am I being naturally excluded here?"

"…You can't take care of anyone."

"Yeah, I wouldn't take care of others even if I died."

<b>

In response to Kobayashi's question, Rentaro answered nonchalantly, leaving those around him exasperated.

If Rentaro is out of the question for group leader, then the person who has the charisma to gather people and is suitable for the role would be...

<b>

"Um, can I do it?"

"Mi-chan, are you sure? It seems like it would be tough..."

"I'm fine. I'm used to this kind of thing."

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

"…"

<b>

◇◇◇

Uejima spoke to Kyori, who raised her hand, with a worried tone, but she confidently replied like that.

In fact, Kyori has the guts to stand up to those old folks from the main family, and she has human charm, being well-liked by her classmates, so she possesses charisma. If she becomes the group leader, we should be able to complete the social studies field trip without any trouble. The problem is that it would put a burden on Kyori, but if she says she's okay, then maybe I can leave it to her...

<b>

"Eh? Wouldn't it be better for Shu to be the group leader? Your sister is going to be one of the middle school students we’ll be with."

<b>

At that moment, an unexpected person objected to making Kyori the group leader.

The speaker of the problematic statement—Asama Rentaro, while wearing his usual elusive smile, pointed to a part of the handout he showed us.

There, for some reason, was a list of names of the middle school students who would be joining us, which we had all somehow overlooked, and our group's list included "Iori Kana" clearly written on it.

<b>

Wait, why didn't I notice that before?
