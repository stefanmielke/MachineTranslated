# 109 - Back Alley Disturbance

Thank you very much for your patience!


----------------

Last night we were dropped a moderately heavy bomb by our uncle.

......Why did I go to ......?

But even today, not one of us cares about such things.

Well, there are a lot of things I need to think about. ......

After all, everyone is still this one! That's that! The switching between the two is amazing.

I guess this is the quintessential AMCAM quality in this area!

<blank>

After a light morning workout with everyone, we had breakfast and left my uncle's consulate.

The first stop after leaving the consulate was the orphanage where Karen was staying.

The day before, we had talked about going to work at the store together because I would pick him up in the morning.

<blank>

Irving and Lombardo said they were going straight to the river port when they left the consulate, so we parted ways as we left the consulate and Bibi, Mia, and I headed there together.

<blank>

<blank>

So we went to Karen's place and found what we encountered: ............. And there it was! There they were! It was unmistakably angels!

What? These cuties?

<blank>

Dan, a boy, and Nan, a girl. I heard they are fraternal twins, but they look so much alike, don't they?

He says he is 6 years old this year, so he is with Amcam's Angel.

So that means I start school next year. That means I'll be two years younger than Annie.

<blank>

Her hair, the same steeple color as Karen's, is so fluffy, it's as if it's made of cotton wool? Are they made of cotton wool? I was like, "What are they made of?

Their eyes are both a beautiful clear cerulean blue, like sparkling marbles.

I heard that these children's eyes are just like their mother's.

<blank>

When she looks up at me with her big, sparkling eyes, my heart is already pounding! I'm sure your hearts will be pounding!

<blank>

At first they were a little wary or shy, clinging to Karen and not coming out from behind her, but when I kneeled down and looked at them and said, "I'm a friend of your sister's," they gradually closed the distance between us and eventually let me hug them.

Already, already! Already!

<blank>

Bibi told me from behind, "As usual, you are easily missed by little kids! Hehehehe .......

Oh, no. I can't stop my cheeks from loosening!

I guess it's not too much to ask that Karen get permission to stay out and visit these kids every week! Duh! It's not unreasonable!

I can't stand the thought of being away from these sweet kids, even for a few days! Oooh! Wakaru!

<blank>

This is something I should do something about. At that time, I promised myself that I would consult with the various authorities as soon as possible!

<blank>

<blank>

As I was interacting with the twins, I noticed that there were fearful eyes peering at me from the entrance of the facility.

Apparently, like the twins, they were children in the care of this facility. These children were apparently intrigued by the fact that there were a number of girls, other than Karen, wearing the rarely seen uniform of Milia Castel Eye.

<blank>

I opened the package of baked sweets that my aunt had given me and held it out to the children, asking, "Do you want some? I asked them, and in no time at all, they were swarming around me, and I was covered with them.

Bibi is behind me, giving me a look that says, "See? Leave me alone!

<blank>

<blank>

As I was covered in children, an elderly man and woman came out of the doorway, scratching their heads and saying, "I'm sorry.

Karen told me that they are the people who manage this facility. I was introduced to them as "a nice couple of people who always have a smile on their faces." ......

Is that so? Hmmm.

<blank>

Sure, it's a smile, but ......, is it more of a "heckle" than a "smile"?

I can't help but notice a sneer in his attitude. I can feel the sneer in his attitude. Hmmm...mmmm.........

<blank>

There are a total of eight children here, including twins. The oldest is eight years old.

Even though it is a small group, they are taking care of such a handful of young children at all hours of the day. It is easy to imagine how hard it must be for them.

The reason why all the children do not reach the age of 10 is because they find adoptive parents (......) or apprenticeships before the age of 10.

Hom, they are surprisingly good at what they do, aren't they?

When I say laboriously, "I see you're having a hard time," he laughs, scratching his head, "Oh no, haha ...... no."

Mmmm, I still feel a sneer in his smile, and he doesn't make eye contact with me at all. ......

<blank>

But, well, all the children here are healthy and cute. They are taking good care of these children who must be in difficult circumstances. Even if I feel a little stinky, maybe I can appreciate them for that.

<blank>

But I never thought I'd have such a pleasant encounter waiting for me.

I couldn't help but enjoy this happy time to the fullest!

<blank>

But such a happy moment passes in a flash.

Immediately, it was time to head to the store.

With hair pulled back, we waved goodbye to the children, "We'll be back!" and waved goodbye to the children for the day.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Karen told me that this was a shortcut, so I went a little further down the alley, and that's when it happened.

Already, I was thinking that the land looks like a bad place for public morals and security, and then I felt like it's just as I expected?

<blank>

Two women walking a little ahead of us were suddenly attacked by a group of men walking in front of us.

The two attacked said, "Kyah! Stop! Let go of me!" and so on, resisting.

It seems that a thief came across two women being attacked.

<blank>

The men were certainly sprinkled with a dash of suspicious signs, so we were on the lookout for them.

The moment he comes toward me, he will kill me on the spot! I am sure that Bibi and Mia felt the same way.

But when the crime was committed right in front of us, we felt like we were playing a trick on them, and we stupidly delayed our initial response.

<blank>

However, Karen was one of the first to make a move.

<blank>

There were three men. Karen was running at the moment one of the bandits reached for the woman.

He then unleashed an unprovoked kick to the back of the man's head, knocking him unconscious.

It's a far cry from the unsure demeanor she usually displays.

It was as if his body had moved on its own, unconsciously, before he had thought about it.

<blank>

But one of the men, noticing that his comrade had been knocked down on the spot, caught Karen in his vision, turned his angry eyes on her, and grabbed the knife in his hand and squeezed it.

Then, as he was about to move to thrust out the knife, suddenly one of the blocks of cobblestones at his feet rapidly grew up and struck the man in the jaw from below with great force.

The man rose two to three meters with his chin up, then dropped straight down onto the cobblestones without effort.

Yeah, this guy is long out of consciousness, too. I could hear something cracking when he was hit in the jaw, so his lower jaw must be in a lot of trouble.

It was Bibi who did this, of course. Bibi had also put his hand on the ground as soon as Karen started running and began to activate the magic.

<blank>

And by the way, Bibi wasn't the only one who had begun to invoke the magic. Mia was also chanting a celebratory prayer at the same time.

<blank>

The moment the last man realized that his two friends had been knocked out, he rushed to get away from there and stepped out to run with the bag he had taken from the woman. He was flipped over grandly on the spot. Boom! and plunged face first into the cobblestone pavement, causing a bit of trouble, didn't he?

<blank>

Yes, the man's legs were tangled with plant ivy that Mia had magically produced.

The ivy did not stop there. More and more ivy was growing all over the man's body, creaking and constricting his body.

<blank>

Oh, I remember the ivy magic that Mia used during the exam, and how the log that was the target was crushed with a creaking sound.

Mia, let's keep it moderate, okay? Oh, I just heard a lot of snapping noises.

<blank>

In no time, three bandits were put out of action.

The game was over before I could get my hands on it, so I dropped the pebble I was holding in my hand onto the ground.

What? When did I hold the pebble?

This was made by stepping on one of the cobblestone blocks underfoot at about the same time Karen moved.

I lifted my heel a little bit, pointed it at one of the cobblestone blocks, stepped on it vigorously and smashed it, and then, with a bang, I quickly caught the pieces that flew away and put them in my hand! I quickly caught the pieces that flew off and put them in my hand.

If something were to happen to Karen, she would instantly shoot the bandit through the forehead! I was thinking, "If something were to happen to Karen, I'd instantly shoot her in the forehead!

Hmmm, that's great Karen. I'll have to invite you to Amcam's training next time.

I am sure that introducing Alicia to Karen will be a good stimulus for her, since she seems to have a similar fighting style to Alicia's.

Alicia will be pleased! Oooh! I'll do that! I'll ask her out today when I get back to the dorm!

<blank>

And while I was thinking about this, Karen was calling me. Apparently, one of the women who was attacked was knocked down and comatose by the bandits.

I hurried up to see what was going on, and sure enough, there were marks on his face as if he had been punched a lot. Wow, even her back teeth are broken! What the hell do you think you're doing to a woman's face?

I think I'm going to kick this assailant in the face as hard as I can! I thought, as Bibi kicked the guy lying on the ground,...... the first one Karen kicked over,...... his head as hard as if he were a soccer ball. That ...... sounded pretty good.

Apparently, this guy is the one who beat up this woman. The culprit stopped moving after making a strange noise like "ah-hoo!" ...... but that's OK, let's leave it alone.

Now the injured woman comes first.

<blank>

Judy! Oh! Oh my God. ....... Judy! Please open your eyes!

<blank>

The other woman who had been attacked clutched at the fallen one and called her name.

I would guess that she is in her thirties or so. She is dressed elegantly and has the air of a wife of some old noble family. But now she seems to be quite upset. It is quite dangerous to shake the body of a person who has received a blow to the head, so I put my hand on her hand and gently asked her to talk to me.

<blank>

"Calm down, please, ma'am, at ......."

What? Oh ...... ah."

Don't worry. We'll take care of you now.

<blank>

I immediately hold out my hand to the fallen woman.

This person also has a broken tooth, so even my 'treatment' can't fix it. ......

After all, Bibi's "healing" also activates the subject's healing power and applies it to the cure, so it's a bit of a stretch.

I think my "heel" is the only way to cure this thing right here.

Therefore, we will continue to use "heel".

<blank>

When I chant "Heal," the woman is suddenly enveloped in light.

The light became a small column, which soon became thinner as if converging, and finally disappeared as a particle of light as if popping.

<blank>

"Is this the healing ...... of the High Priestess ......?"

<blank>

The lady mentioned such a thing when she saw the woman surrounded by light.

No, it's not really high-level healing magic. ......

<blank>

Hmmm, no more scars on the face. The swelling has gone down nicely. Your teeth are back! No problem.

If you look closely at her face, she is still young and beautiful. She is about 20 years old or so, I guess.

He seemed to be regaining consciousness and began to open his eyes little by little.

The woman looked at me as if to say, "Are you all right now? When I nodded, she seemed relieved and started talking to the woman gently again.

<blank>

Judy ......, Judy, are you okay?"

"............ Oh, oh! Owner! Are you safe? Are you injured?

<blank>

This is a great guy. As soon as the woman called Judy opened her eyes, she started worrying about the lady first, rather than herself.

When the lady confirmed that her sister was okay, she gave her a strong hug and they cared for each other.

<blank>

I'm sorry Judy! You were right, I should have taken the safe main street!"

'Things are really rough around here,' he said. Yeah, but I'm glad the owner is safe!"

<blank>

Hmm? I knew things were pretty rough around here, didn't they?

Why does Karen look so "normal?" Why does she look like that? What is it? Is Karen's sensibility a little strange?

<blank>

<blank>

"I am so sorry, I never thanked you for your help and ....... Thank you so much for helping me through a difficult time."

<blank>

The lady bowed her head politely toward us, taking the sister's hand in hers.

<blank>

No, I was just passing by by chance, that's all. Please don't mind me.

I'm sure you are the students of Milia Castel Eye, aren't you? So much healing ......, I guess they are candidates for theology department and future saints."

No, no! I am not such a person!

<blank>

Suddenly the word "saint" came up and I freaked out! There's no way that's true!

What are Mia and Bibi grinning about? And Karen, don't give me that "Oh! I'm not making a face like that!

<blank>

Oh, oh! It seems that the guards have arrived. So! We're in a hurry, so I'll leave you now!

<blank>

I saw a group of guards running from the entrance of the alley.

Surprisingly, the guards are responding quickly.

Are they patrolling this area? I knew it, doesn't that mean the alleys around here are not as safe as we thought?

<blank>

Three of the bandits are wrapped in a gurgling screen of ivy that Mia had put out.

The right citizen's choice is to leave the rest to the professional guards.

These are the culprits!" He pointed to the rolling men and called out to the guards, then to the ladies, "Excuse me, then! He bowed his head and hurried away with everyone in tow.

<blank>

Oh no, I've taken up a lot more time than I thought I would.

If you don't hurry, you're going to be late for work.

Thank you for reading!

What a surprise, this is finally my first post of the year....

We are very sorry!
