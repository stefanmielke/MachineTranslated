# Chapter 109: The Commotion in the Alley

Thank you for your patienceーー！！

----------------

<b>

Last night, we were dropped a rather heavy bombshell by our uncle.

…It was a mistake, but… 

However, there isn't a single person among us who is still worried about it today.

Well, there are various things we need to think about, but…

Everyone is just amazing at switching gears like this! 

This is truly the Amukamu quality, isn’t it?

<b>

After a light morning training session together, we had breakfast and left the consulate.

The first place we headed after leaving the consulate was the children's home where Karen is.

We had talked the day before about picking her up in the morning to go to work together.

<b>

Irvin and Lombard said they would head straight to the river port after leaving the consulate, so we parted ways right outside and decided to go with Vivi and Mia.

<b>

<b>

When we got to Karen's place, what we encountered…… was! Without a doubt, angels were there!!

What are these cute kids?!!

<b>

There was a boy named Dan and a girl named Nan. I heard they were fraternal twins, but they look so much alike?!

They said they are six years old this year, so they are the same age as Amukamu's Anje.

That means they will start school next year. Annie is two years younger than them.

<b>

Their hair, the same raven color as Karen's, is fluffy, as if it’s made of dandelion fluff?! 

Both of their eyes are a beautiful clear cerulean blue, sparkling like marbles.

Apparently, their eyes take after their mother.

<b>

When they looked up at me with those sparkling big eyes, my heart went thump thump!!

<b>

At first, they seemed a bit wary or shy, clinging to Karen and not coming out from behind her, but when I knelt down to match their eye level and said, “I’m your big sister’s friend,” they gradually closed the distance and eventually let me hug them.

Oh, it was just too much!!

<b>

Vivi said from behind, “You always get along with little kids so quickly,” but if you’re envious, just say you’re envious! Hehehe…

Ah, no good. I can’t stop smiling!

I think it’s only natural that Karen gets permission to stay out every week to come see these kids! Yes! It’s only natural!!

I can’t imagine being apart from such cute kids for even a few days! Yes! I understand!!

<b>

This is something that needs to be addressed. I vowed in my heart at that moment to consult various parties urgently!

<b>

<b>

While interacting with the twins, I noticed a gaze peering cautiously at us from the entrance of the facility.

It seemed that, like the twins, there were other children being cared for at this facility. These kids were intrigued by the sight of several girls in the rarely seen Miria Castle Eye uniforms, aside from Karen.

<b>

I opened the package of baked sweets that I received from my aunt and offered it to the children, asking, “Do you want some?” and in no time, I was surrounded by kids, completely covered in them.

Vivi shot me a look from behind that said, “See?” Please leave me alone!

<b>

<b>

While I was covered in kids, an elderly couple poked their heads out from inside the entrance, scratching their heads and saying, “We’re sorry about this.”

According to Karen, they are the ones managing this facility. They were introduced as “a couple who always have a smile and are kind-hearted,” but…

Is that so? Hmm…

<b>

They certainly have smiles, but… it feels more like a “grin” than a “smile,” doesn’t it?

I can’t help but feel a sense of servility in their attitude. Hmm…

<b>

There are a total of eight children here, including the twins. The oldest is said to be eight years old.

Even though it’s a small number, they are taking care of such young children all day long. It’s easy to imagine the hardships they must face.

It seems that all the children are under ten because they find adoptive parents or placements before turning ten.

Hmm, they might actually be quite capable, these folks.

When I said, “You must be going through a lot,” they laughed while scratching their heads, saying, “Oh, ha ha… no…”

Hmm, I still feel a sense of servility in their smiles, and they don’t meet my gaze at all…

<b>

But well, all the children here are lively and cute. They are properly taking care of those who must be in difficult circumstances. Even if I feel a bit suspicious, perhaps I should appreciate these people.

<b>

However, I never expected such a delightful encounter to await me.

I couldn’t help but fully enjoy this happy moment!

<b>

But such a happy time passes in the blink of an eye.

Before I knew it, it was time to head to the shop.

Reluctantly, I waved goodbye to the children, saying, “I’ll come again!”

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

After Karen showed me that this was a shortcut, it happened as we walked a bit further down the alley.

I was thinking that it really seemed like a place with poor morals and security, and sure enough, it was just as I thought.

<b>

Two women walking a little ahead were suddenly attacked by men coming towards them.

The two who were attacked were resisting, saying, “Kyaa! Stop! Let go!”

It seemed that we had stumbled upon a robbery in progress.

<b>

Indeed, the men were exuding an aura of suspicion, so we were on guard.

The moment they came towards us, I was ready to take them down right there! I’m sure Vivi and Mia felt the same way.

Yet, since the crime was happening right in front of us, we ended up being slow to react.

<b>

But amidst all this, only Karen moved quickly.

<b>

There were three men. The moment one of the thugs reached out to the woman, Karen had already started running.

Then, she delivered a powerful kick to the back of that man’s head, knocking him out instantly.

Her movement was completely different from the unsure attitude she usually shows.

It was as if her body moved instinctively, before she even had time to think.

<b>

However, one of the men, realizing that his companion had been taken down, spotted Karen and glared at her with rage, tightening his grip on the knife he held.

Just as he tried to lunge at her with the knife, suddenly, one of the cobblestones beneath his feet shot up rapidly, striking him hard under the chin.

The man’s chin shot up as he was lifted two to three meters off the ground, before falling limply onto the cobblestones.

Ah, he’s definitely unconscious now. I even heard a sound like something cracking when his chin was hit, so his jaw must be in terrible shape.

Of course, this was done by Vivi. As soon as Karen started running, Vivi had also placed her hands on the ground and began to activate her magic.

<b>

Additionally, it wasn’t just Vivi who started casting magic. Mia was also chanting incantations at the same time.

<b>

The last man, realizing that his two companions had been knocked out, hurriedly tried to escape with the bag he had stolen from the woman. But the moment he stepped forward, he tripped spectacularly and fell face-first onto the cobblestones with a loud thud. That must have been quite a disaster for him.

<b>

Indeed, the man’s feet had been ensnared by the vines that Mia had conjured with her magic.

The vines didn’t stop there. They continued to spread all over the man’s body, tightening around him.

<b>

Ah, I remember the scene during the exam when Mia used the vine magic, and the log that was the target was being crushed with a creaking sound.

Mia, let’s keep it moderate, okay? Ah, I can hear the sound of several things snapping one after another.

<b>

In no time at all, the three thugs were rendered unable to act.

Since everything was over before I could even step in, I dropped the small stone I had been holding for a finger flick onto the ground.

What? When did I start holding a stone?

This was made from one of the cobblestones I crushed just as Karen moved.

I had quickly stomped down with my heel on one of the cobblestones, shattering it, and swiftly caught the flying fragments in my hand.

I had intended to shoot the thugs in the forehead instantly if something happened to Karen! But Karen was completely fine.

Hmm, amazing, Karen. I should definitely invite her to Amukamu’s training next time.

She seems to have a fighting style somewhat similar to Alicia’s, so I think introducing Alicia to her would provide a good stimulus for Karen.

Alicia would surely be happy! Yes! Let’s do it! I’ll invite her when we return to the dorm today!

<b>

As I was thinking about such things, Karen called out to me. It seemed that one of the women who had been attacked was knocked out after being beaten by the thugs.

I hurried over to check on her, and indeed, she had numerous marks on her face as if she had been heavily punched. Whoa, it looks like she even broke a molar! What kind of scum thinks they can treat a woman’s face like this?!

I was thinking of giving a solid kick to the face of this assailant! When Vivi kicked the one who was first taken down by Karen, it sounded like she kicked a soccer ball. …That made quite a good sound.

It seems this guy was the one who knocked the woman down. After letting out a strange sound like “Agyo,” he stopped moving… well, whatever, let’s leave him be.

Right now, the priority is the injured woman.

<b>

“Judy! Oh no! What happened… Judy! Please open your eyes!!”

<b>

The other woman who was attacked clung to the fallen one, calling her name.

She looked to be in her thirties, dressed elegantly, giving off the air of a former noblewoman. But she seemed to be quite shaken. It’s understandable, but shaking someone who has received a blow to the head is quite dangerous, so I placed my hand over hers and gently spoke to her.

<b>

“Please calm down, …ma’am.”

“Eh? Ah… ah.”

“Please rest assured. I will provide treatment now.”

<b>

I immediately held my hand over the fallen woman.

Since this lady had broken teeth, I knew my “first aid” wouldn’t be enough to fix her…

After all, Vivi’s “healing” also activates the subject’s healing abilities, so it would be a bit difficult.

If I wanted to completely heal her here, I would have to use my “heal.”

So, I decided to use “heal” right away.

<b>

As I chanted “heal,” the woman was enveloped in light.

The light formed a small pillar, which quickly narrowed as it converged, and finally burst into particles of light that disappeared.

<b>

“This… is… the healing of a high-ranking priest…?”

<b>

Seeing the woman wrapped in light, the lady said such a thing.

No, it’s not a high-level healing magic or anything…

<b>

Hmm, the wounds on her face are gone. The swelling has completely disappeared. Her teeth are back too! Yes, no problem.

Looking closely at her face, she is still young and a beautiful woman. She looks to be in her early twenties.

It seems her consciousness is returning, as she slowly begins to open her eyes.

The lady looked at me as if to ask if she was okay, and when I nodded, she seemed relieved and began to gently speak to the woman again.

<b>

“Judy… Judy, are you okay?”

“…………Ah, oh! Owner! Are you safe?! Are you hurt?!!”

This woman, called Judy, is amazing. The moment she opened her eyes, she started worrying about the owner before herself.

Once the owner confirmed that Judy was okay, she hugged her tightly, and they both began to care for each other.

<b>

“I’m sorry, Judy! We should have taken the safe main road like you said!”

“This area is really dangerous. Ah, but I’m glad the owner is safe!”

<b>

Oh? I guess this area really is quite dangerous, isn’t it?

Why does Karen look like it’s “normal?” Huh? Is Karen’s sense of danger a bit off?

<b>

<b>

“I’m very sorry, and I didn’t even get to thank you… Thank you so much for helping us in such a difficult situation.”

<b>

The lady, still holding Judy’s hand, bowed politely to us.

<b>

“No, we just happened to pass by. Please don’t worry about it.”

“You are students of Miria Castle Eye, aren’t you? With such healing… you must be candidates for future saintesses from the theology department.”

“N-no! I’m not that kind of person!”

<b>

Suddenly, the term “saintess” came up, and I was taken aback! There’s no way that’s true!

Mia and Vivi, why are you both grinning like that?! And Karen, don’t make that “oh!” face!

<b>

“Ah, ah! It seems the guards are coming. We must hurry, so we will take our leave now!”

<b>

I spotted the guards running in from the entrance of the alley.

The guards are surprisingly quick to respond.

Are they patrolling this area? It seems the security in this area is worse than I thought.

<b>

The three thugs were all tied up in vines that Mia had conjured.

It’s the right choice for a good citizen to leave the rest to the professional guards.

After pointing at the rolling men and saying, “These are the criminals!” I bowed to the ladies, saying, “Then we will take our leave!” and hurriedly led everyone away.

<b>

Oh no, I ended up taking more time than I expected.

I need to hurry, or I’ll be late for work.
