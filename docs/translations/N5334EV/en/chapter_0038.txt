# Episode 38: The Children of Amukam Part 2

Continuation of the children's side.

Depressing developments. Please be cautious of cruel depictions.

----------------

<b>

"What's wrong, Child Eater? You aren't getting cold feet, are you? Huh?"

"This old man! You're going too far! I'm going to kill you, Olbett!"

<b>

"Ha! Is it alright, Child Eater? Sending such weaklings at me? I can't stop you, you know?"

"Don't get cocky... you mere human!!!"

"Calm down, Lyra, Lawrence. His aim is to draw our attention and send his comrades toward the village. Don't get played."

<b>

"Hmph! A mountain leech! Do you have some brains after all?"

"This guy... Ahab! I'm going to take care of this! Die, old man!!"

"Stop! Lyra!!"

<b>

The vampire called Lyra ignored the restraint and sent her shadows flying toward Howard.

<b>

Howard instantly channeled magic into his equipment, causing the magical sigils on his entire body to briefly shine.

<b>

In that instant, Howard's figure blurred as the shadow spear sliced through the air.

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

Lyra's eyes widened in shock.

But immediately, she realized something and jumped back.

Right after, a blue light raced horizontally through the space where Lyra had been. It was the sword flash of a Zweihänder wrapped in holy energy.

<b>

"Ugh! What the hell is this?! This movement! Is he really human?!"

"I told you to stop, Lyra! This guy is the 'Iron Demon God.' Don't engage him directly."

"Damn it! Is this guy?!"

<b>

With a grinding sound, Lyra bared her fangs and gritted her teeth.

<b>

"Hmph! You may be fast on your feet, vampire! Speaking of which, you're good at sneaking away into the shadows, aren't you? You don't need to imitate such pests, do you? Huh?!!"

<b>

Howard bared his teeth ferociously and continued to provoke.

<b>

"This... you're getting too cocky!"

"I told you to stop, Lawrence."

"Let's just surround him! Bernie, lend a hand!"

<b>

"Are you forgetting about me?"

<b>

A rider shimmered with equipment and closed in right next to Lawrence.

The knight sword gripped in his hand shone golden with the gathered holy energy and was swung in a straight line.

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

Lawrence instinctively dodged, but was slightly late, and the part of his left arm from the elbow down was severed.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

"Lawrence?! ...Ahab, what the hell is going on? Why are there two people here who can handle holy energy to this extent? Explain!"

<b>

As Lawrence staggered back, a vampire called Bernie supported him while visibly irritated, questioning Ahab.

<b>

Lawrence quickly regained his stance.

The part of Lawrence's arm that had been severed by the rider began to heal rapidly.

<b>

"That was the 'Vampire Slayer' from the West. I warned you."

"Damn... is this guy also one of them?"

<b>

Lawrence moved his returned left arm to check its movement while glaring at the rider.

<b>

"Lawrence is being too careless. Isn't that right, Ahab?"

"That's right. Just as Plutora said, we are pawns of Olbett. Don't let your emotions run wild."

<b>

With her long silver hair swaying, the vampire named Plutora stepped forward, sending a cold gaze at Lawrence while seeking Ahab's agreement.

<b>

"Ahhahahahahaha! Lyra! Lawrence! You're having quite the trouble, aren't you?"

<b>

Olbett let out a genuinely delighted laugh and called out to the two in front.

<b>

"Lord Olbett!"

"I apologize, Lord Olbett."

<b>

"How about you come forward already, Child Eater? At this rate, your pawns will be exterminated soon."

<b>

"This!"

"Old man!"

"Hahahaha! You're quite bold. Well, it's not like you're the first one to come at me with that kind of bravado."

<b>

Suppressing the two who were furious, Olbett continued the conversation with Howard.

<b>

"Oh, so that means I'll be your final opponent, huh?"

"Ahhahahahaha! You say that! But unfortunately, I'm not interested in old men; I'll leave the fighting to these kids."

<b>

Olbett spread his hands as if regretting it and shook his head.

<b>

"And you know, it's much more entertaining to watch from here! Right now, the children are dancing with such joy, it's just too funny and delightful! Hehe."

"You bastard! What are you doing?!!"

"That's good; I like that face of yours... one hour."

"What did you say?!"

"In about an hour, the sun will set. From there, it will be our time... It's time to start the feast."

<b>

As Olbett declared, he exaggeratedly spread his arms and spoke loudly.

<b>

"What I ordered these kids to do is just one thing: 'Don't kill anyone until the sun sets.' After all, it's a feast, and snacking before the meal is just rude, right? Hehe."

"You bastard!!"

<b>

"Everyone is bravely following the rules! Even the children hiding in the shadows would normally want to sink their fangs into you, but they're holding back with just their claws! They're really doing great!"

<b>

With a low growl, several black shapes peeked out from within Olbett's shadow.

They appeared to be distorted human figures with crocodile-like snouts and fangs.

<b>

"Shadow Ghouls?!"

<b>

Shadow Ghouls. Man-eating monsters that lurk in shadows and lack a physical form.

They cannot exist in sunlight; they are truly creatures of darkness.

How many of them are here?

<b>

<b>

"Lord Olbett! Lord Olbett! I apologize! I was almost about to break your orders!"

"That's fine, Lyra. You're holding back well, so when the time comes, you can do as you please."

"Thank you very much, Lord Olbett!!"

"Lord Olbett is too lenient with Lyra!"

"Is that so? I just think everyone is cute."

"Lord Olbett... Mmm."

<b>

Olbett gently stroked Lyra's cheek.

<b>

"So until sunset, you all can go to school as you please. After all, a barrier will be up soon. Even if one or two skilled ones show up, it won't matter in the end."

<b>

Olbett waved his hand dismissively, telling Howard and the others to do as they liked.

<b>

"You filthy creatures!"

<b>

The rider expressed his disgust as if spitting it out.

<b>

"Now then! So I’ll be watching until the time comes. That red-haired girl who was here last time. Her struggle was really good! I can still vividly remember it! The deliciousness of her desperately trying to cling on until the end!! Haha! Ah, it's too bad! I wish there were more delicious kids like her! Really! I'm looking forward to it! Ahaha, ahaha, ahhhahahaha!"

<b>

"You bastard! You bastard!!"

<b>

The rider's face deepened with anger as he glared at Olbett's words.

<b>

Olbett let out a laugh filled with delight, instantly spreading a pair of large, dark, ominous bat wings from his back and took off into the sky.

<b>

"You coward! Don't run, Child Eater!! Come back! Come back! Child Eeeeeeater!!!"

<b>

Howard raised his fist and shouted in rage.

Howard's voice, tinged with anger, echoed throughout the Amukam forest.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It's over. I'm going to activate it now, okay?"

<b>

Eliza spun the activation device she had been toying with in her hand and began to channel magic into it.

Then, a magic circle rose from the ground, surrounding the entire school grounds.

<b>

Initially emitting a pale blue light, the magic circle cracked and was quickly covered by a poisonous blood-red color.

<b>

Soon, a honeycomb-like transparent panel was constructed in the sky, covering the school grounds in a dome shape.

Once it was completed, it emitted a brief flash of light and became an invisible barrier.

<b>

"Now the barrier is complete."

"Shall we start preparing? We have less than an hour left."

<b>

Eliza clapped her hands as if to signal the start, and countless black spears shot up from the shadows of the two.

<b>

As they extended about five meters, the tips bent sharply and pointed toward William and the others.

As William and the others widened their eyes in shock, the black spears lunged toward them, rushing in with great force.

<b>

William and the others raised their shields and quickly set up a defensive position with stone walls, but the black spears grazed them, piercing through the walls of the training ground, collapsing and destroying them.

The once sturdy walls of the training ground crumbled with a loud noise.

<b>

"W-What is this?! The walls of the training ground fell so easily?!"

<b>

Looking at the destroyed walls of the training ground, Arvin muttered in disbelief.

The mid-tier children inside were frozen in place, speechless at the sudden turn of events.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, hey, do you think it's okay to snack a little?"

"What are you saying, Doug? Have you forgotten Lord Olbett's orders?"

"I haven't forgotten! I haven't forgotten, but after seeing this... right?"

"Well, I can't help but feel unsatisfied after just tasting a little... but there's less than an hour left, right? Can't you hold on? It'll be tastier that way."

"I know! I know, but... look at this... is it not okay?"

<b>

Saying that, he lifted Fiorina's arm, which he was holding in his left hand.

<b>

"Come on, as someone preparing the ingredients, I think it's okay to at least have a taste..."

"Stop it! Lord Olbett is watching, you know? Do you understand? ...I think Lord Olbett is kind enough to forgive you, but... I think it's better to follow the orders properly to show your loyalty."

"Yeah, that's true... well, as long as I don't let her die, right? Then it wouldn't count as breaking the orders!"

"Ugh! Do as you like!"

"Hehe, it'll be fine! I can control myself."

"That's not really saying you're controlling yourself..."

<b>

"Since we came here, I've been right in front of her, and I've been holding back all this time! Well, I did nibble a bit! She's really delicious, this big sister."

<b>

Saying that, Doug lifted Fiorina's arm and brought her neck, which was hanging limply, right in front of his eyes.

<b>

"Ah, I can't resist this smell."

<b>

With that, Doug extended his long, red, reptilian tongue and licked from Fiorina's shoulder to her neck.

<b>

"…Ah… uuuuh…"

<b>

Fiorina, who was supposed to be unconscious, let out a muffled moan.

<b>

"I'm going to take it now, okay? I'm going to take it! Hehe."

<b>

Doug lifted Fiorina's left arm with his left hand.

With his free right hand, he carelessly grabbed her hair, pulling it down to expose her white neck right in front of him.

And then, he slowly sank his two small, knife-like fangs deep into Fiorina's young neck.

A horrible sound of flesh tearing spread from Fiorina's neck.

<b>

"Haah... ugh... ugh... hng... hhh..."

<b>

As Doug's throat made a sound, Fiorina's body writhed slightly, and a painful, gasping moan escaped her lips.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"F-Fiorina?"

"W-What? What's he doing to Fiorina?!"

<b>

The twins, Clark and Ashton, crawled out from the rubble of the training ground and stood beside Dana, their eyes wide at the unclean act happening in front of them.

<b>

"You two! Don't come out! Get back down!"

<b>

Colin noticed the twins and immediately shouted to pull them back, but they couldn't hear him.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Clark and Ashton, along with Fiorina, had all just reached the 6th tier this term.

<b>

Recently, Stefan's mischievousness had been more noticeable, often overshadowing them, but the twins' mischievousness was also quite considerable.

Their pranks, executed in tandem, had caused plenty of headaches for adults and upperclassmen alike.

<b>

Fiorina was always the one to advise and protect the twins.

<b>

The Smith and Atlee families were relatively close, so the three had been together since before they could remember.

<b>

Fiorina's caring nature may have been shaped by having to look after these two since childhood.

The twins couldn't help but respect Fiorina, their greatest understanding.

They could always predict what the twins were thinking, and they could tell how serious Fiorina was when she was angry.

They understood each other without needing to say a word.

Clark, Ashton, and Fiorina had lived together like siblings until today.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, Fiorina was being held by an incomprehensible opponent right in front of them.

They didn't understand the situation, but they could tell something dangerous was happening.

<b>

Fiorina's complexion was turning pale before their eyes.

This is definitely bad!!

<b>

"UUUAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

<b>

The twins jumped out together.

<b>

"Stop! Get back!"

<b>

William immediately jumped out, but he was still several steps away from the two.

He instinctively chased after them, but his expression twisted at the distance.

<b>

"YOU BASTARD!!!!"

<b>

Both twins were equipped with short swords and round shields.

They charged forward, holding their shields up.

<b>

As the two jumped out, a shadow dog lunged at them from the front.

<b>

Clark thrust his shield toward the shadow dog's snout, slamming it down.

As the shield grazed it, Ashton thrust his short sword into it.

At the same time, Ashton pressed his shield against the shadow dog.

Without hesitation, Clark swung his short sword from behind Ashton's shield.

They alternated between defense and attack, right and left, sometimes up and down, utilizing their well-coordinated twin combination.

<b>

However, that attack only worked against magical beasts that appeared in the shallow layers of the forest.

It was difficult to achieve an effect against an opponent with a significant power gap.

Their attacks couldn't penetrate the fur of that magical beast.

Moreover, the numerical difference was overwhelming.

<b>

Before they knew it, a brutal bat that had glided in from low altitude used its strong, sharp claws to gouge Clark's back and the back of his head, sending him flying.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

"Clark?! Ugh! Cough!!"

<b>

Ashton was bitten on the head by a second shadow dog that jumped from the side and was slammed to the ground.

<b>

"Get off me!!!"

<b>

William, who arrived a step late, struck down the shadow dog's face that was biting Ashton's head with his short sword.

William, having had one eye gouged out, struck the shadow dog, which flinched and released its bite.

<b>

William raised his shield and swung his short sword while moving to protect the twins.

At that moment, Lombard, who had arrived late, stood beside him, also raising his shield.

<b>

"Get the two of them back! Colin, treat them!!"

<b>

William shouted, and Dana and Arvin carried the twins back.

Both were bleeding heavily and unconscious.

William confirmed the two being carried away with a sideways glance and glared again at the two vampires in front of him.

<b>

<b>

"Now! It seems they started it over there. Shall we go all out?"

<b>

Before they knew it, Doug had distanced himself from Fiorina and cheerfully spoke to Eliza.

Fiorina was thrown at their feet.

Like a discarded toy, carelessly.

<b>

"Hey, you didn't kill her, did you?"

"Don't worry! She's barely breathing. Safe! Ahaha."

<b>

Eliza looked down at the pale, motionless Fiorina with a skeptical gaze and asked Doug, who only grinned in response.

<b>

"You bastard!"

<b>

William gritted his teeth and glared at the scene.

But the relentless onslaught of shadow dogs was gradually pushing William and Lombard back.

<b>

<b>

"Willy! Please take care of Ashton! Clark is in bad shape! Ah! No! The bleeding won't stop! Bibi! Lend a hand! ...Bibi?"

"What happened, Bibi?!"

<b>

Beatrice reacted to Colin's call but showed no response.

Arvin noticed her condition and hurried over to her side.

<b>

But Beatrice was kneeling on the ground, wrapping her arms around her body, trembling slightly.

<b>

"Algernon... Algernon is... going to die."

"!!"

<b>

Beatrice looked up at Arvin with tears in her eyes, pleading.

<b>

"That kid... he was bitten so much! He was toyed with... yet he kept running... that kid, that, that..."

"Beibi! Pull yourself together! Damn it! Can't we do something?!"

<b>

Arvin grabbed Beatrice's shoulders and shouted softly.

At that moment, a black spear grazed Arvin's cheek and shot forward into the group of children behind them.

<b>

"Charles! Thomas!"

<b>

Colin's scream echoed.

The black spear pierced through the younger... Charles Bowmant of the 2nd tier and Thomas Rigotti of the 3rd tier, disappearing.

The moans and screams of the young children filled the area.

<b>

"You bastards!"

<b>

William deflected the extending black spear with his shield and slashed at it with his sword, but the shadow dog took advantage of the opening and inflicted more wounds.

<b>

"Kelmu Eigo Espero Eude. Pierce! <<Styx Gun>>"

<b>

Mia's incantation caused roots to rapidly rise from the ground, sharpening at the tips like spears, and shot out toward the shadow dogs surrounding William.

<b>

The shadow dogs instantly reacted and retreated from William, but further shadow dogs...

<b>

"Kelmu Eigo Espero Eude. Shoot through! <<Fire Bullet>>"

<b>

The fireball shot by Carl hit a shadow dog, engulfing it in flames.

<b>

"Yes!"

<b>

Carl clenched his fist, his face relaxing with joy at the hit.

<b>

<b>

"Fire attribute users are a bit of a nuisance."

"Yeah, there seems to be only one of them, so let's take care of it first."

<b>

As they looked at Carl, the two vampires exchanged such words, and numerous black spears shot up from Doug's feet, piercing through Carl's body one after another.

<b>

"Ugh? Buu!!"

<b>

Carl was blown away by the spears, blood gushing from his body as he fell.

<b>

"Carl!"

<b>

Mia, who had been casting magic next to him, rushed over to help him up, but numerous black spears approached Mia as well.

One of them gouged into Mia's side, sending her flying.

<b>

"Ugh?! Higggh!!"

<b>

Mia rolled on the ground, crashing into rubble before finally stopping.

Mia was wearing corset-style leather armor. However, the black spear easily pierced through it, gouging her side.

Blood gushed uncontrollably from the gouged area, and she rapidly lost color. Her body began to twitch violently.

<b>

"Damn it! Mia!! What happened?! MIAAAA!!!"

<b>

William rushed over to Mia, immediately using healing magic, but the bleeding wouldn't stop.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Eliza pointed at Mia, asking Doug with her eyes, "What about that one?"

<b>

"Well, just a side note? Either way, leaving a magical attacker is a hassle."

<b>

Doug shrugged in response.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"MIAAAAAAAA!!!"

<b>

While pushing back the shadow dogs with spears, Dana shouted back to the children in the ruins of the training ground.

<b>

"You're okay! Still!! You're still okay!!"

<b>

William raised his hand over Mia, concentrating on healing while shouting back.

<b>

"…Mia!"

<b>

Beatrice, who was hastily treating Carl, bit her lip and looked at Mia.

<b>

"Damn it! We're seriously short on hands!!"

<b>

Arvin shouted, swatting away a brutal bat descending toward Beatrice with his longsword, expressing his frustration.

<b>

"Compared to this! Ugh! Compared to Suzy's thrust! Ugh! This is too easy!!"

<b>

Helena Slater, who had switched her weapon from a bow to two daggers, shouted while repelling shadow dogs next to Dana.

<b>

"Ugh! Exactly!! This is nothing! ...Ha! Compared to Suzy's rapid-fire strikes! Ugh! I'm yawning!!"

<b>

Both Dana and Helena, despite being heavily injured, focused their strength on attacking, thinking of one girl.

<b>

"That's right! Suzy's strikes are... far heavier!"

<b>

Lombard shouted as he pushed back several shadow dogs with the tower shield he held.

<b>

"If we get pushed back like this! We won't be able to face Su-sister!"

<b>

Mary, dodging several brutal bats swooping down, shot arrows into the sky while shouting.

<b>

"You guys! You say that... hey!!"

<b>

Arvin shouted as he struck a descending brutal bat.

He managed to injure its wing membrane, but it didn't fall.

<b>

<b>

"Stop! Shelly, Virgil, please lend a hand!"

<b>

Colin called over the 5th tier Shelly Frank and the 4th tier Virgil Filain, asking for their help with healing.

<b>

"But Colin! We can't use healing yet!"

<b>

Shelly's words were not a negative expression of anxiety. They stemmed from a sense of frustration that she couldn't do anything right now.

This feeling was common among all the mid-tier children taking refuge in the training ground.

If they could, they would want to fight on the front lines! However, with their current abilities, they would only drag down the upperclassmen. So for now, they could only do their best with what they could do here.

<b>

"You're fine, just hold the wound and send magic. You always practice with magical tools, right? Just do it like that."

<b>

Colin placed gauze over the wound and taught Shelly the basics. He entrusted Shelly with Charles and Virgil with Thomas, and the two focused intently on healing.

<b>

"Right now, the bleeding has stopped, so just keep it up, okay?"

<b>

Colin dragged his left leg as he hurried back to Clark and Ashton for treatment.

Clark's bleeding hadn't completely stopped yet. He was currently being held down by Gloria Heron, who was also at the 5th tier, pressing gauze on his wound.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"These kids here are amazing! Normally, if you get beaten this much, you'd break, but no one is giving up! If anything, their fighting spirit is rising! No wonder Lord Olbett is looking forward to this."

<b>

Doug looked up at Eliza with shining eyes, enjoying himself.

In response, Eliza shrugged her shoulders.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Eh? No way! Algernon? No way!!"

"What happened, Bibi?! Did something happen to Algernon?"

<b>

Arvin asked Beatrice, who had frozen with wide eyes, worriedly.

<b>

"That kid... his wounds are completely healed...!"

"What?!"

"More importantly! I found Su! I can summon her!!"

<b>

Arvin's eyes widened in astonishment, and he exchanged glances with Beatrice.

<b>

"Can you summon her right away?"

"Give me three minutes! I’ll definitely summon her!!"

"Alright! Sounds good!! Everyone, listen up!!!"

<b>

With Beatrice's response, Arvin smiled and raised his voice.

<b>

"Three minutes! Hold out for three minutes!! Here she comes!!!"

<b>

He raised his longsword high, as if to reach everyone present, and shouted loudly.

<b>

In that place, Carl, who had received Beatrice's healing, had stopped bleeding and was lying down, looking somewhat relieved, though his breathing was still rough.

<b>

A little distance away from Carl, Beatrice drew a summoning magic circle on the ground and began inscribing the incantation.

<b>

Arvin stood in front of the two, crouching low and ready with his longsword.

<b>

"Three minutes! We will endure!!"

<b>

Arvin shouted again.

<b>

"Hehe! Alright! Let's do this!!"

"Ufu! Hehe! I need to show my sister!!"

"Yeah! I won't let them reach Arvin!"

<b>

The morale of the frontline fighters, Dana, Helena, and Lombard, surged.

Seeing that, William...

<b>

"Just as I thought, Suzy..."

<b>

He muttered with a wry smile.

<b>

"Everyone! Suzy is coming! Just a little longer! Just a little longer, so hang in there!"

<b>

Colin called out to the children in the ruins of the training ground, and everyone responded with bright voices.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It seems like hope has suddenly lit up, but what is it?"

"Yeah, it seems like they're planning something... should we ignore it? Or should we crush it?"

"Shall we crush it? I wonder what kind of faces those kids will make? Don't you want to see? I want to see!"

"Wow, that's so despicable. Doug, you're so despicable."

"Hehe, thanks."

<b>

Suddenly, countless black spears shot up from their feet.

In a moment of surprise, even the two with shields could only brace themselves against the impact.

Dana and Helena, who weren't holding shields, barely avoided fatal injuries but were knocked away, their bodies riddled with numerous wounds.

<b>

The black spears that broke through the front lines also reached the children in the ruins of the training ground.

They pierced through Virgil's left shoulder, Leila Carter's abdomen, Dennis Hawtry's back, and Colin's right thigh.

<b>

"Ugh! Gah!!"

<b>

Colin's left calf was bleeding but had stopped, yet he was far from being able to walk.

His right leg also took further damage, and he could no longer stand.

He fell over, rolling on the ground.

<b>

<b>

The approaching black spears numbered five.

Arvin slashed down two of them and knocked one away with the hilt of his sword.

The remaining two, if avoided, would reach Beatrice.

Without hesitation, Arvin slid his body into their trajectory.

One grazed his left arm, altering its path, while one pierced into his left side and vanished.

<b>

"ARVIN!!!!"

<b>

Beatrice let out a heart-wrenching scream.

<b>

"Bibi! Focus! Don't worry about me!!"

"But! Arvin! We have to heal your wounds! The blood is...!!"

"…Later! Right now... your job takes priority! Don't worry... I'll protect you! ...I promised, didn't I?!"

"Arvin..."

"You're the girl I've decided to protect! I will definitely... absolutely protect you!!"

"Arvin, Arvin... Arvin...!"

<b>

With tears welling in her eyes, Beatrice began to weave the incantation, channeling magic.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It seems like it's still going on?"

"Ugh, I'm not too fond of that. Shall we just go directly?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Damn it!"

<b>

The situation was dire. The two vampires were completely in a playful mood. They could disrupt the summoning spell at any time.

Arvin had to divert their attention for just a few minutes until Beatrice's preparations were complete.

<b>

He glanced back. Colin was desperately trying to lift himself up.

He had injuries to both legs and couldn't stand, but he was still okay...

<b>

A burning irritation and anger flared in his temples.

What the hell is okay?! Colin, who was in that state, was far from okay!!

I'm not here to make Colin suffer!!

William traced his fingers over the "Control Orb" on his breastplate, steeling himself.

<b>

"Lombard, I'm counting on you here."

"?! Will? What are you saying?"

"I'm going to charge at the vampires now and draw their attention away from here. I need you to maintain the defense line in my absence!"

"What are you talking about, Will! You can't possibly reach them!"

"Well, I'll give it a try. I'm going now!!"

"Wait! Will!!"

<b>

William shattered the Control Orb on his armor, activating the magic circulation circuit.

The magical sigils on his entire body emitted a stronger light than usual, indicating that the circuit had been activated.

<b>

"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!"

<b>

William charged through the pack of shadow dogs, still glowing with magic.

<b>

William moved with a speed that was on a different level than before.

As a shadow dog approached him, he instantly swung his short sword sideways, cleaving its face.

He severed the front leg of a dog that lunged at him from the side and knocked it away with a punch.

<b>

With a physical ability that was incomparable to before, he dispatched the shadow dogs one after another, closing in on the vampires.

<b>

Colin, watching from a distance, was wide-eyed at the sight of William enveloped in light.

<b>

"Don't do it, Will! You can't use that so recklessly!!!"

<b>

Colin shouted, his face contorted in anguish.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The magical sigils engraved on William's equipment were standard for the civil defense force's armor.

There isn't much difference in effectiveness between the equipment worn by low-tier and those worn by high-tier like Howard.

<b>

Their primary effects are to enhance defense and physical abilities, but the degree of performance improvement varies greatly depending on the user's abilities.

<b>

The enhancement of abilities is multiplied by the amount of magic power input relative to the original physical abilities.

If one is skilled, they can use a minimal amount of magic with high magical pressure to produce a significant magical value.

On that basis, they channel magic into the sigils, allowing for a high level of ability enhancement.

Moreover, the greater the enhancement, the more significant the burden on the mind and body, but techniques to minimize that burden through instantaneous on-off control are also necessary.

<b>

The strength of high-tier individuals like Howard comes from their high base physical abilities combined with the skillful manipulation of magic power.

<b>

On the other hand, those with low-tier physical abilities and insufficient magical techniques cannot raise their ability values to such an extent.

This is due to their inherently low physical abilities and their inability to produce high magical values needed for significant enhancements.

<b>

Of course, if one can input high magical values, they can expect even higher ability enhancements.

However, if someone with low magical pressure attempts that, they will lose a large amount of magic power and rapidly deplete their magic.

A rapid drop in magic power leads to loss of consciousness.

Furthermore, enhancing abilities beyond one's capacity can cause unnecessary damage to the body.

<b>

Naturally, control devices are installed on the equipment to prevent that.

That is the "Control Orb."

<b>

The "Control Orb" functions as a magic battery for those with low magic power while also acting as a breaker to suppress excessive magic supply.

<b>

William was currently shattering that "Control Orb," excessively supplying magic to his equipment, and forcefully performing an overboost.

It was a time-limited superhuman transformation.

For just a brief moment, he could wield power beyond his own stature through a forceful method.

However, the backlash could potentially burn out his central nervous system.

The cost of wielding that power was immeasurable.

<b>

William broke through the pack of shadow dogs and approached the vampires.

Countless black spears surged toward him in an instant, but he deflected them, dodged, and slashed them down.

He reached Doug in one breath.

For a moment, Doug widened his eyes in surprise and stared at William.

<b>

At this point, William's body was bleeding from ruptured capillaries due to the excessive magic supply.

<b>

But William did not stop advancing.

With his kite shield, he deflected the last mass of black spears and thrust his short sword into Doug's chest.

In the next moment, Doug vanished from that spot and reappeared behind William.

With his fingers elongated like blades, Doug aimed to stab them into William's back, thrusting his five fingers sharply.

William quickly twisted his body to the left and deflected Doug's claws with the kite shield.

Using that momentum, he swung his short sword horizontally to the left.

Doug barely dodged it by stepping back slightly.

William switched his short sword and slashed upwards to the right.

Doug deflected it with his claw-like fingers, and William slashed back again, which Doug avoided.

Doug stepped back, dodging and deflecting William's continuous slashes while laughing merrily.

On the contrary, William's impatience grew.

Blood flowed from his eyes, nose, and ears.

In an instant, as he deflected Doug's claws, an opening appeared in Doug's chest.

William once again thrust his short sword with all his might toward the spot where Doug's heart was.

<b>

<b>

"Close, just a little more. Maybe... right?"

<b>

The short sword pierced through Doug's palm and stopped.

William felt the rapid loss of strength from his body.

<b>

Doug pushed out the pierced right hand, inserting it all the way to the base of the short sword, grasping William's right hand by the hilt.

<b>

"What? Is it over already? It was a bit fun, you know?"

<b>

Chuckling, Doug twisted William's right hand at the wrist and crushed his fist.

<b>

"GAH!!"

<b>

William dropped to one knee on the spot.

Blood dripped from his entire body as if he were sweating, forming a pool of blood at his feet.

He no longer had the strength to even stand.

<b>

"What? What is that! It seems to be turning into something delicious all on its own?"

<b>

Eliza, with a glint of desire in her eyes, approached William from behind, placing her fingers on her mouth.

Her cheeks flushed as if intoxicated by the smell of blood, her eyes glistening.

<b>

Standing behind William, who was kneeling with his back to Doug, Eliza caressed his cheek with both hands, gazing at the blood that had soaked her palms.

Eliza looked at her blood-stained hands, unable to contain herself, and licked her lips.

Then, she pressed her blood-soaked palms against William's face, greedily licking up the blood.

<b>

"I don't want to... it's so delicious."

<b>

With her face smeared with William's blood, Eliza murmured with an ecstatic expression.

<b>

"Hey? Can I take him? Can I eat him? ...Right? It's okay, right? It's fine, right?"

"Wait, weren't you supposed to not let him die?"

<b>

Doug pulled out the short sword stuck in his right hand and discarded it, looking up at Eliza with a curious expression.

His palm bore no scars.

<b>

"Ugh! Doug, you're so mean! Fine! As long as he doesn't die, it's okay! Ufu♪"

<b>

With that, Eliza instantly transformed her right hand's fingers into vicious claws.

She thrust them into William's back in one swift motion.

<b>

"GAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!"

<b>

William arched back from the impact he received in his back.

Eliza lifted William's body over her head with one hand.

<b>

"Ugh! Gah!"

<b>

As William arched back over Eliza's head, he began to cough up blood.

Eliza caught the droplets of blood falling from above and licked them up with her long tongue.

<b>

"Delicious... so delicious... more, give me more."

<b>

Eliza moved the claws she had thrust into William's back carelessly.

<b>

"GAH! GAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"

<b>

Blood gushed out in an instant, literally showering Eliza with blood.

She received it with her wide-open mouth, rubbed it all over her body with her left hand, and licked it up with her long, extended tongue.

<b>

"Ah! So delicious! It's beating, it's twitching... ufu, ufu... I want to squeeze everything out of you... ah! So delicious! It's wonderful! The best!"

<b>

Eliza was soaked in William's blood, her expression one of ecstasy.

<b>

<b>

"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WILLY! WILLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!"

<b>

Colin screamed William's name in a voice filled with despair.

Dragging his unsteady legs, he reached out toward William.

But that hand could not reach him.

Only Colin's cries for William echoed in that place.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The sun had tilted quite a bit.

The sky was tinged with red, and shadows grew long.

He could feel the black spear piercing his side thumping like a second heartbeat.

But he didn't care about the pain.

His older brothers had said that when the fighting spirit rises, even deep wounds can be forgotten. Indeed! It didn't bother him at all! Arvin's mouth curled into a grin, revealing his fierce fangs.

<b>

With William charging at the vampires, the black spears stopped coming toward him.

However, the front line was on the verge of collapse.

<b>

Lombard was holding back the shadow dogs with his tower shield, but Bibi's stone wall was being significantly breached.

Shadow dogs had slipped through the gaps and were clinging to Lombard, biting him.

There were four of them. They were biting at his limbs, and the bleeding was severe.

It was a wonder he was still standing, but he was still trying to push back the shadow dogs trying to squeeze through the gaps.

<b>

Kate was also being attacked by two shadow dogs, pushing her down.

They were biting at her legs, holding her down, and it seemed they were about to bite her.

Dana was trying to drive off the shadow dog that was trying to bite Kate's leg by slamming her spear down.

<b>

The shadow dog was trying to bite Dana as well, but she barely managed to shake it off.

However, Dana's right calf had been gouged out along with her boot.

Even so, Dana was amazing for still being able to move!

<b>

Helena had a wound on her head or forehead, and the left side of her face was covered in blood.

Yet she continued to shoot arrows at the brutal bats.

<b>

The mid-tier children were forming a shield around the injured children, thrusting spears through the gaps to fend off the brutal bats swooping down from above.

<b>

<b>

And now, two shadow dogs had broken through the defense line and were rushing toward Arvin.

<b>

One was targeting him, and the other was targeting Bibi, huh? Not if I can help it, you bastards!

Arvin cursed inwardly, blocking the path of the two shadow dogs.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Arvin Haggard was born and raised as the third son of the Haggard family.

His father, Harry Haggard, served as the leader of Amukam's 12th squad's 4th team, known as "The Golden Lion," one of Amukam's main forces.

<b>

The eldest son, Bart, is recognized as the best warrior in Amukam County.

The tale of "The Golden Wolf of Destruction" is known by everyone in this country.

He has been abroad for the past two years, and Arvin hasn't seen him since.

However, his admiration and goal have not changed since childhood.

<b>

The former knight rider, one year older, proved his strength and made a name for himself in a different frontier from Amukam in the West.

The title of "The Golden Vampire Slayer" made Arvin proud every time he heard it.

<b>

<b>

Arvin was a purebred warrior of Amukam, having grown up watching his father and brother.

Now, an obstacle he must crush was approaching.

He could feel a hot surge rising from his gut.

Behind him was Bibi, the one he had to protect! There's no way I'm letting you through!!

He licked his upper lip with his tongue, and a smile involuntarily broke out.

Crouching low like a sprinter at the starting line, his bright dark blonde hair swayed, and his amber wolf eyes glimmered with golden light, characteristic of his family.

<b>

He thrust his left hand forward, dragging his longsword with his right hand, kicked off the ground, and dashed forward.

The shadow dog that was a body length ahead of the two decided to target Arvin and charged straight at him.

<b>

The shadow dog opened its mouth and leaped toward Arvin to bite him.

Arvin pulled back his left arm for a moment, timing it perfectly, and thrust his left fist into the shadow dog's mouth. Arvin's arm was twisted into the shadow dog's mouth up to his shoulder.

The shadow dog's fangs sank into Arvin's upper arm, biting down repeatedly.

<b>

Receiving the impact of the shadow dog's leap with his left arm, Arvin's body was swung to the left.

The other shadow dog attempted to slip past Arvin's right side, but as Arvin spun to the left, he swung the longsword in his right hand, using centrifugal force to strike the shadow dog's front leg.

The shadow dog was knocked down, its front leg slashed by the longsword, and it tumbled over.

Damn it! I couldn't cut off its leg! I still don't have enough strength!

But!! The shadow dog on my left is starting to foam at the mouth from biting my arm. It will suffocate soon!

It was worth it to give up my left arm! And the other one too!

<b>

Arvin rolled over to the shadow dog, still biting his left arm, and threw away his longsword.

He tried to wrap his arms around the shadow dog's neck to choke it, but instead, it bit down on his right arm and pulled him down.

<b>

"Ugh! You bastard! Stay still!! Gah!!"

<b>

The shadow dog lunged at Arvin, trying to tear off his right arm, biting down and shaking its head.

<b>

<b>

"Arvin! Arvin!!!"

"Don't worry, Bibi! Leave this to me! You focus on your job!!!"

<b>

The shadow dog's fangs tore into Arvin's arm, and blood dripped down, splattering his face as he shouted to Beatrice.

<b>

"Ar-Arvin...!!"

<b>

As Beatrice bit her lip, channeling magic, the magic circle began to glow.

<b>

"It's here! ...It's in!"

<b>

The magic circle was filled with the magic power needed to activate the summoning spell.

<b>

"Go for it! Bibi! Bring Su with you!!!"

<b>

Arvin's shout echoed through the area.

Beatrice began to chant the incantation for the summoning spell.

<b>

"Kelmu Eigo Espero Eude. I call out and plead. My kin, respond to my call and appear before me! Kelmu Eigo Espero Eude!! I plead!!! Come! Algernon!! Bring Su with you!!"

<b>

The summoning circle radiated a brilliant light.

The light enveloped the summoning circle, rising slowly and narrowing toward the center.

<b>

Arvin looked up at the pillar of light.

Dana, Mary, Lombard, Colin, Kate, and Willy, everyone still conscious, held their breath and watched in silence.

<b>

Sensing some kind of presence, the shadow dogs stopped moving and growled at the light.

The two vampires also sent sharp glances.

Everyone present was captivated by the pillar of light.

<b>

Eventually, the light faded, and a figure appeared.

<b>

With two small pigtails of red hair, the girl looked adorable, shining like a ruby in the sunlight.

Her light green dress was refreshing, fluttering gently in the wind, with plenty of frills dancing at the hem.

<b>

However, around her waist, she wore a sword belt and had two swords strapped to it, which seemed inappropriate for such a girl.

<b>

With braided boots perfectly fitted, she stood straight, cradling a small animal in her hands as if to scoop it up gently.

The rodent in her palm squeaked, "Kikikyu."

<b>

"Algernon! Su!!!"

<b>

Beatrice's eyes filled with tears as she called out the names of the one girl and one creature.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What? You went to all the trouble of using a grand summoning spell, and I thought a powerful familiar would come, but it's just a girl?"

"Yeah, a bit of a letdown? But since you went this far to summon her, you should probably stay on guard."

<b>

Eliza shrugged in response to Doug's disappointed words.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Algernon jumped down from Su's palm and ran over to Beatrice.

It squeaked happily, raising its nose as if to boast about its achievement.

<b>

"Yes! Algernon! You did well! You did so well!!"

<b>

Beatrice hugged Algernon, rubbing her cheek against it in gratitude.

<b>

Su stood in front of the one girl and one creature, looking around in bewilderment.

<b>

"What? What is this?"

<b>

Su's eyes reflected the sight of the blood-soaked children.

In front of her were Carl, Arvin.

A little distance away were Mia, Lombard, Dana, and Helena!

<b>

"What? What is this?!"

<b>

As the shadow dog that had been biting Arvin growled and bared its fangs, it lunged at Su.

<b>

Beatrice saw the shadow dog slip past her and leap at Su.

But in the next moment, the shadow dog vanished.

A sound like a pop echoed right in front of her.

Su's left wrist seemed to have brushed something away, facing outward.

A heavy thud resonated from her right side.

Looking to the right, she saw dust rising about 20 to 30 meters away.

Though it was far, she couldn't see well, but it looked like several animal-like legs were sticking out of the ground.

And they were spaced more than five meters apart.

<b>

<b>

"Self-restraint? What is that?! F***ing ridiculous!!!!"

<b>

Su spat out those words, untied her hair, and shook her head.

Her loose hair spread out, shimmering in the evening sun.

<b>

"No one will die in front of me! I have no intention of letting anyone die!!"

<b>

With her ruby-red hair sparkling, Suzy Cloud declared.

<b>

----------------

I am... Suzy Cloud!!
