Depressing development. Please be aware of cruel descriptions.

"What's up, Childeater? You're not going to tell me you got scared, are you? Hmm?

You old man! You've been fooling around too much! I'm going to kill you, Master Orbet!

<blank>

Kuha! Are you sure, Childeater? You're sending this mook after me? I can't stop it, can I?"

Don't get smart with me... you human!

Relax, Lila and Lawrence. He's just trying to get our attention so he can get the group to the village. Don't let him get to you.

<blank>

Hun! Mountain leech style! Have you some wisdom?"

This guy...Ahab! I'll do it! Die, old man!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Lila!

<blank>

The vampire called Lila ignored the restraint and sent the shadows around her to Howard.

<blank>

Howard instantly poured magic power into his equipment, and the magical markings on all the equipment on his body momentarily glowed.

<blank>

A moment later, Howard's figure blurs and a shadow spear cuts through the air.

<blank>

Nanny?

<blank>

Lila is wide-eyed and astonished.

Immediately, however, he realized something and jumped back.

Immediately after, a blue light runs right across the space where Lyra was. It was the sword flash of a Zweihender clad in holy air.

<blank>

Damn! What is this guy? How can he move like this? Is he really human?

So stop it, Laila! This is the 'Iron Demon God. Don't take him seriously."

"Damn! This guy?"

<blank>

Gillibly baring her fangs, Laila bites her teeth.

<blank>

"Hmph! You're not the only one who can run fast, are you? Vampire! You're good at sneaking away and hiding in the shadows, aren't you? Why do you need to imitate such a pest? What?

<blank>

Howard bares his teeth ferociously and continues to provoke.

<blank>

You ...... are on a roll!"

I'm telling you to stop, Lawrence.

'Why don't we just surround them? Bernie, give me a hand!"

<blank>

You're forgetting about us, aren't you?"

<blank>

The rider's equipment gleamed and he was right next to Lawrence.

The nightsword in his hand glowed golden with the holiness he had kneaded, and was then flashed in a single, straight line.

<blank>

Nah?

<blank>

Lawrence ducked as quickly as he could, but he was slightly delayed, and his left arm was cut off from the elbow.

<blank>

Gah!

Lawrence?" ...... Ahab what do you mean? Why are there two people here who can handle holy chi? Explain!

<blank>

As Lawrence stumbled backward, the vampire called Bernie supported him and asked Ahab, with obvious frustration, "What is it that you want?

<blank>

Lawrence immediately regains his position as well.

Lawrence's elbow, which had been cut off by the rider, was repaired before his eyes.

<blank>

It was a 'bloodsucking killer' from the West. You have been warned."

Damn ...... this guy too?"

<blank>

Lawrence stares at Ryder as he moves his hand to check the movement of his left arm, which has returned.

<blank>

Lawrence is too careless. Isn't that right, Ahab?"

Yes, Putola is right. We are pawns of Master Orbet. Don't run on emotion."

<blank>

A vampire called Putola, her long silver hair swinging, stepped forward, giving Lawrence a cold look and asking Ahab for his consent.

<blank>

'Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Lila! Lawrence! You're having a hard time!

<blank>

Orbet gave a hearty laugh and called out to the two in front.

<blank>

"Master Orbet!"

I'm sorry, Mr. Orbet.

<blank>

Why don't you come forward, Childeater? If you don't, your pawns will soon be exterminated, won't they?"

<blank>

Son of a bitch!

Grandpa!

Ha-ha-ha-ha! You're so bossy, aren't you? Okay, you're not the first person to come at me with that kind of aggression.

<blank>

Orbette continues her conversation with Howard, restraining their indignation with her hand.

<blank>

"Well, then I'll be your last, won't I?"

'Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha! You say that, don't you? You say that, don't you? But, unfortunately, I'm not interested in the old man, so I'll leave it to these girls to play with you.

<blank>

Orbet spread his hands and shook his head, as if he were disappointed.

<blank>

Besides, it's much more interesting to watch from here! It's so funny to see the kids dancing so happily right now! Kuhuhuhuhu.

You! What are you doing?

I like it when you look at me like that. ......... for an hour."

What?

The sun will be setting in an hour or so, and then it's time for us to get started. ...... It's time to start the party!

<blank>

Orbet opens her hands in a grand gesture as if to declare, and then speaks out loud and clear.

<blank>

I gave them only one order: "Don't kill anyone until nightfall. Don't kill anyone until the sun goes down. Because it's a party, and it's not nice to eat before the meal, right? Pfft..."

You!

<blank>

They are all obediently doing what I tell them to do," he said. The children in the shadows of these children would have liked to stick their fangs in, but they only use their fingernails to hold back! That's really great!

<blank>

With a low "groololololol ......" roar, a number of black blobs peeked their heads out from within Orbet's shadow.

It looked like a distorted figure with a crocodile-like snout and fangs.

<blank>

Shadow ghouls!

<blank>

Shadow Ghoul. Man-eating demons that lurk in the shadows and have no substance.

They cannot exist in a place where the sun shines, they are the very inhabitants of darkness.

How many of them are here?

<blank>

<blank>

Dear Orbet! Master Orbet! I am so sorry! I almost broke your orders!

Lila, you've been very patient, so when the time comes, you can do whatever you want.

Thank you very much! Master Orbet!

Even Lady Orbet has a soft spot for Laila!"

"Really? I just think they're cute."

"Master Orbet, ah......n."

<blank>

Orbet stroked Lila's cheek softly.

<blank>

So until nightfall, you guys can head to school if you want. The enclosure will be built anyway. You should know that one or two skilled people won't help you."

<blank>

Orbet turns to Howard and the others and tells them to do as they please with a flutter of his hand.

<blank>

You filthy bastards!"

<blank>

The rider reveals his disgust as he vomits.

<blank>

I'm going to watch the game until it's time to go! So I'm going to watch the game until it's time to go. That little red-haired girl who was here before. Her struggle was really good! I can still remember it. The deliciousness that bites you in the throat as you struggle to the end and don't give up! Ah, no! Oh, no! I'm drooling just remembering it! Ha-ha-ha! Oh, I wish I had a girl that tasty again! Really! I'm really looking forward to it! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

You! You! You!

<blank>

The rider's wrinkles of indignation carved even deeper and deeper into Orbet's words.

<blank>

Orbette laughed with a joyful laugh and instantly spread her huge, black, ominous bat wings on her back, then flew off the ground.

<blank>

I'm not going to let you get away with this! Don't run away, childeater! Come back! Come back! Childeater!

<blank>

Howard raises his fist and screams in exasperation.

Howard's voice, tinged with anger, echoed through the forest of Amkamu, echoing everywhere.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm done. Let's get this thing up and running, shall we?"

<blank>

Eliza spun the activation device she had been toying with in her hand, and began to cascade magic power into it.

Then, a magic circle emerged from the ground to surround the entire school grounds.

<blank>

The magic circle, which at first emitted a bluish-white light, became distorted, and in no time at all, the top of the magic circle was covered with a poisonous, blood-colored color.

<blank>

Soon, a honeycomb-like transparent plate surface was assembled in the sky above, covering the school site in a dome-like shape.

When it was assembled, it shone for a moment and then became an invisible ward.

<blank>

Now you have an enclosure."

Then, shall we start the preparation? We don't have an hour left.

<blank>

Eliza clapped her palms together as if to say, "Let's begin," and countless black spears shot upward from their shadows.

<blank>

After extending about five meters, the tip of the pole bent and pointed toward William and the others.

As soon as William and the others opened their eyes, a black spear reached out toward them and came at them with great force.

<blank>

William and his men quickly took up defensive positions with their shields up and the stone walls closing in, but the black spears snatched them away, piercing, crashing, and destroying the walls of the training hall through the roof.

The walls of the supposedly solid training hall crumbled down with a loud noise.

<blank>

What is this? The walls of the training hall are this easy?

<blank>

Looking at the destroyed walls of the training hall, Irving muttered in dismay.

The children in the middle and lower levels who were inside were speechless and frozen.

<blank>

<blank>

Hey, hey, do you think it's okay if I pick at you a little bit?"

What are you talking about, Doug? Did you forget what Master Orbet told you?"

I haven't forgotten! I haven't forgotten. But if you show me this much... hey?"

I can't help but feel that the licking I just did wasn't enough... but there's less than an hour left. Can't you stand it? It tastes better that way.

I know, I know! I know, but... you know, this... this... no?"

<blank>

Then he lifted Fiorina's arm in his left hand.

<blank>

I think it's okay for those who prepare the food to taste it..."

Oh, my God! Mr. Orbet, you're looking at me. Do you understand? ......Master Orbet is kind and will forgive you, but I think it would show your loyalty to him if you followed his orders properly.

'Yes, that's right... okay! So you don't have to let him die, right? Then I won't have to break your command!

"Oh, God! Do what you want!"

Heh, heh, heh. I'll be fine! I can control myself."

I can't say it's already restraining itself..."

<blank>

I've been right in front of you ever since you came here, and I've been holding back for a long time, well, I've been getting a little bit of it! It's really delicious, you sissy."

<blank>

With that, he lifts Fiorina's arms to the top and brings her neck, with her head hanging down weakly, in front of his eyes.

<blank>

Oh, I can't stand the smell.

<blank>

Doug continued to lick his long, blood-red, reptilian tongue up from Fiorina's shoulder to her neck.

<blank>

"......aaaai...ughhhhh ......"

<blank>

Fiorina, who is supposed to be unconscious, lets out a muffled moan.

<blank>

"We'll take it now, won't we? I'm going to take it, aren't I? Heh heh."

<blank>

Doug went on to grab Fiorina's left arm in his grip with his left hand and lifted her up.

With his free, opposite right hand, he grabbed her hair carelessly and pulled it down, exposing her white neck before his eyes.

Then, he slowly plunged his two small, exposed, knife-like fangs deep into Fiorina's young neck.

The sound of fearless, dull flesh tearing spreads around Fiorina's neck.

<blank>

I'm going to say, "Hagiii ...... oooh, ...iiguiu ...... hagun ...... hihi... ..."

<blank>

Fiorina's body writhes and a pain-filled, gasping moan escapes from her mouth as Doug clears his throat.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Huh, Fiorina?"

What is he doing to Fiorina? What is he doing to Fiorina?

<blank>

The twins, Clark and Ashton, crawled out of the rubble of the training hall and lined up beside Dana and the others, their eyes fixed on the unholy act that was taking place beyond.

<blank>

"You guys! No, don't come out! Get down!

<blank>

Colin notices the twins and shouts for them to retreat immediately, but they don't hear him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The twins Clark and Ashton and Fiorina are three of the same sixth floor from this season.

<blank>

Although Stefan's mischievousness has recently become more noticeable and tends to be overshadowed, the twins' bravado was also quite impressive.

The pranks played by the twins' combination had been causing a lot of trouble for the adults and upperclassmen.

<blank>

Fiorina always admonished and defended the twins.

<blank>

The Smith and Utley families were located relatively close to each other, so the three were already together before they could remember.

<blank>

Fiorina's caring personality may have been formed because she had to take care of these two from an early age.

<blank>

The twins are head over heels for Fiorina, who is their most understanding friend.

Always anticipating what they are thinking, the twins know immediately to what extent Fiorina is really angry.

You know who you are dealing with even before you put it into words.

Clark, Ashton and Fiorina are like brother and sister to this day.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now, that Fiorina is being held in front of me by someone I don't understand.

I don't know what's going on, but I know something bad is going on.

<blank>

Fiorina's complexion turns white as she watches.

This is not good no matter how you look at it!

<blank>

'Aaaaahhhhhh!"

<blank>

The twins popped out together.

<blank>

No, no, no, no! No!"

<blank>

William immediately jumps out, but the distance between them is more than a dozen paces.

He quickly follows them, but the distance distorts his expression.

<blank>

"You son of a bitch!"

<blank>

They are both equipped with short swords and round shields.

The two men push forward with their shields held out.

<blank>

As they jumped out of the way, one of the shadow dogs jumped at them from the front.

<blank>

Clark rammed his shield into the shadow dog's nose as if to slam it down.

Ashton thrusts his shortsword into the shield as if to snatch it.

At the same time, Ashton now thrusts his own shield at the shadow dog.

Clark, without a second glance, swings a shortsword from behind Ashton's shield.

Alternate between defense and attack, to the left and right, sometimes up and down.

It's a way for the two of them to attack each other, taking advantage of their breathtaking twin combination.

<blank>

However, their attacks are only effective against the demonic beasts that appear in the shallow layers of the forest.

It is difficult to be effective against an opponent with a large gap in ability.

The two of them cannot pierce the fur of that magical beast with their attacks.

And the difference in numbers is overwhelming.

<blank>

Before he knew it, the Brutal Bat's strong, sharp leg claws glided in from low overhead, gouging the flesh from Clark's back to the back of his head and blowing it away as it was.

<blank>

Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

Clark?" Gee! Kahaha!!!"

<blank>

Ashton was struck in the head by a second shadow dog that jumped at him from the side and knocked him to the ground.

<blank>

This! Retreat!!!!!!!"

<blank>

William, a step late in arriving, brought a short sword down on the face of the shadow dog that was sucking Ashton's head.

William slammed his kite shield on the shadow dog, which was frightened and let go of its mouth after being blinded in one eye, and sent it flying backward.

<blank>

William held up his shield and carried his legs, swinging his shortsword carelessly to protect the twins.

Lombardo, who arrived late, also lined up and held his shield at his side.

<blank>

Get them both to the back, quickly! Colin, get the treatment!

<blank>

William shouted, and Dana and Irvin took the twins in their arms and brought them to the rear.

They both lost a lot of blood and were unconscious.

William glanced sideways at the two vampires as they were being held up, and then glared again at the two vampires in front of him.

<blank>

<blank>

"Well, you know! It looks like they started it over there. Shall we go with a bang?"

<blank>

Doug, who had somehow moved away from Fiorina, happily spoke to Eliza.

Fiorina is thrown at its feet.

They are just random, like toy dolls that you are tired of playing with.

<blank>

You didn't let this one die, did you?"

I'm fine! I'm barely breathing. I'm safe! Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

Eliza looked down at Fiorina, who was now white-skinned and motionless, and asked Doug with a glare, but he merely made a playful gesture.

<blank>

Curse you!"

<blank>

William stared at him, gritting his teeth at the sight.

However, William and Lombard were slowly but surely being pushed back by the shadow dogs that kept coming.

<blank>

<blank>

Willie! Ashton, please! Clark is terrible! Oh! No! The blood doesn't stop completely! Bibi! Give me your hand! ...... Bibi?"

What's up, Bibi?

<blank>

Beatrice did not respond to Colin's call.

Irving noticed the situation and rushed to her side.

<blank>

But Beatrice kneeled on the spot, put her arms around herself, and shivered a little.

<blank>

Algernon is ......, Algernon is... dying."

!!!"

<blank>

Beatrice burst into tears and looked up at Irving to plead her case.

<blank>

'Oh, that girl... she was bitten like that, like that! He played with me like that... and still he ran ...... like that, like that, like that ...... like that."

Bibi! Pull yourself together, Bibi! Shit! Can't you do something?

<blank>

Irving grabs Beatrice by the shoulders and gives a little shout.

At that moment, a black spear snatched Irving's cheek and extended forward.

As it was, the spear plunged into the children in the rear.

<blank>

Charles! Thomas!"

<blank>

Colin screams.

The black spear pierces the younger ... 2nd Dan Charles Beaumant and 3rd Dan Thomas Ligoti and disappears.

The moans and screams of young children fill the area.

<blank>

You guys!

<blank>

William's black spear is still extended, and he uses his shield to repel it and his sword to strike it down, but the shadow dog takes advantage of this opportunity and his wounds increase.

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eudes. Paso! ≪Stex gun."

<blank>

The roots of the plant, which rose rapidly out of the ground in Mia's celebration, pointed their tips like spears and shot out several toward the shadow dogs around William.

<blank>

The shadow dogs reacted instantly and moved away from William, but then went on to the shadow dogs....

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eudes. Fire away! ≪Fire Bullet."

<blank>

A flaming bullet fired by Karl shoots a shadow dog, engulfing one in flames.

<blank>

Yes!"

<blank>

Carl clenched his fists and his cheeks relaxed with the joy of the hit.

<blank>

<blank>

The use of the fire attribute is a little depressing."

"Yeah, it looks like he's alone, so let's get rid of him first."

<blank>

As the two vampires conversed while looking at Carl, several black spears shot up from under Doug's feet and instantly pierced Carl's body one after the other.

<blank>

What? Bu!

<blank>

Karl was blown away by the spear and fell down, spewing blood all over his body.

<blank>

Carl!"

<blank>

Mia, who was casting magic next to him, rushed to help Carl up, but several black spears came at her and pierced her as well.

One of them gouges out Mia's side and blows her body away.

<blank>

Aaghi? Higuah!

<blank>

Mia was sent rumbling to a halt and finally stopped when she hit a piece of rubble.

Mia was wearing corset-type leather armor. But the black spear easily pierced through it and gouged out her side.

Blood poured out from the gouged out place without stopping, and as I looked at it, I was losing my bloodlust. His body was twitching and twitching.

<blank>

Damn." Mia! Oh my god! Mia!

<blank>

Willie rushes to Mia and immediately uses a recovery technique, but the bleeding does not stop at all.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Eliza, that one too?　and pointed to Mia and asked Doug with her eyes.

<blank>

Well, what's the point? Either way, it's a pain in the ass to leave a magic attack hand."

<blank>

I answered, cowering my shoulders.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

MEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!"

<blank>

Dana called out to the rear as she speared through the gaps in the stone walls made by Beatrice, which had been destroyed in places, and the shadow dogs that were trying to slip past William's side.

<blank>

It's okay! Still! I'm still okay!

<blank>

Willie holds out his hand to Mia, who returns it aloud while concentrating on healing.

<blank>

"...... Mia!"

<blank>

Beatrice, who hastily treats Carl, also looks at Mia, biting her lip.

<blank>

I'm seriously short-handed! We're seriously short-handed!"

<blank>

Irving spoke of his frustration as he dispelled the Brutal Bats descending toward Beatrice with his longsword, driving them away.

<blank>

Something like this! Gee! Suzy sister's...! Ugh! Compared to a thrust! It's too warm! Unh!

<blank>

Helena Slater, who had switched from a bow to two daggers, shouted as they fought off the shadow dogs next to Dana.

<blank>

Gghh! Totally! Such a thing! ...Ha! Compared to the speed of Suu's continuous fire! Gah! I'm yawning!

<blank>

Both Dana and Helena, both with many wounds on their bodies, think of one girl, and their attacking hands are filled with power.

<blank>

'Yes! Suzy's blow is... far heavier!"

<blank>

Lombardo raised his voice as he pushed back several shadow dogs at once with the tower shild in his hand.

<blank>

'By such a thing! If I'm pushed! I won't be able to face my sister Sue!"

<blank>

Mary shot an arrow back into the sky while dodging several gliding Brutal Bats and shouted.

<blank>

You guys...! You said it... yo!

<blank>

Irving shouted and struck a blow to the descending Brutal Bat.

It damaged the wing membrane, but not enough to drop it.

<blank>

<blank>

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Shelley, Virgil, please give me a hand!"

<blank>

Colin calls in 5th Dan Shelley Frank and 4th Dan Virgil Filane to help with the treatment.

<blank>

But Colin, we can't use healing yet! We can't use healing yet!"

<blank>

Shelley's words are not negative, coming from anxiety. They come from a sense of frustration that there is nothing she can do now.

It is a thought shared by all the children of the middle and lower middle class who have taken refuge in this training center.

<blank>

If we could, we would like to fight on all fronts ourselves! However, with the way we are now, we are only dragging the upperclassmen down. So for now, we have no choice but to at least do the best we can here.

<blank>

I'm fine. All you have to do is suppress the wound like this and send the magic to me. You always practice with the grimoire, don't you? That's how it works."

<blank>

To Shelley, Colin places gauze over the wound and goes over the basics of how to do it. Leaving Sherry to tend to Charles and Virgil to tend to Tomas, they concentrated single-mindedly on the healing process.

<blank>

I've just stopped the bleeding. Just keep it going, okay?"

<blank>

Colin continues to limp on his left leg and hurries back to Clark and Ashton for treatment.

Clark has not yet stopped bleeding completely. He is now being held by Gloria Heron, who is in the same 5th level as Shelley, with gauze over the wound.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The kids here are amazing! Usually, if you get beat up this much, you're going to lose heart. But no one is giving up! On the contrary, their fighting spirit is rising! No wonder Master Orbet is looking forward to it.

<blank>

Doug looked up at Eliza happily and his eyes lit up.

In response, Eliza cowered her shoulders.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What? No way! Algernon? No way!

What's wrong Bibi? What... happened... to... Algernon?"

<blank>

Irving spoke to Beatrice, who froze with her eyes wide open, with concern.

<blank>

That boy... his wounds are completely healed...!

What about?"

I don't care about that! I found Sue! I'll call her out!

<blank>

Irving is blindsided and looks at Beatrice.

<blank>

Can you call it right now?"

Give me three minutes! I'll call you out for sure!

Good! Superlative! Everybody listen up!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

Beatrice's answer made Irving grin and his voice rose to the occasion.

<blank>

Three minutes, give me three minutes! They're coming... ！！！！"

<blank>

He raised the longsword in his right hand like a raised fist and shouted at the top of his voice to reach everyone in the room.

<blank>

Karl is lying there, still breathing heavily but looking somewhat relieved after Beatrice healed him and stopped the bleeding.

<blank>

A short distance away from Karl, Beatrice draws a magic circle of summons on the ground and inscribes the formula.

<blank>

Irving stood in front of them as if he was protecting them, leaning back and readying his longsword.

<blank>

Three minutes! We will endure!

<blank>

Irving again strains his voice.

<blank>

Heh! All right! Let's do it!

Hmmm..." Heh! Your sister, she has to see it!"

I'm not going to let you get to Irving! I won't let you get to Irving!"

<blank>

The morale of Dana, Helena, and Lombardo on the front line went through the roof.

William saw that....

<blank>

"That's great, Susie..."

<blank>

He mumbles and chuckles.

<blank>

Guys." Sue is coming! Almost there! We're almost there, hang in there!"

<blank>

When Colin called out to the children at the training site, they all responded in cheerful voices.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It's like a light of hope has suddenly gone on.

"Well, it sounds like you're going to do something about it...leave it alone or crush it? Do you want to leave it or do you want to crush it?"

"Shall I crush them? What do you think they'll look like? Don't you want to see? Don't you want to see it? Don't you want to see it?

I'm like, "Wow, that's so gross. Doug is such a prick."

Heh, thanks."

<blank>

With a zing, countless black spears suddenly extended out from under their feet.

Even the two men with shields could only withstand the impact as quickly as they could.

Dana and Helena, who did not have shields, barely escaped fatal wounds, but were gouged countless times throughout their bodies and sent flying.

<blank>

A number of black spears, passing through the vanguard, reach the children in the training area ruins.

It pierced the left shoulder of Virgil, who was treating Thomas, the belly of Layla Carter, the back of Dennis Whatley, and the right thigh of Colin.

<blank>

Ack! Gee!

<blank>

Colin's left tibia has stopped bleeding, but is far from being able to walk properly.

His right leg was further damaged, and he could no longer stand.

He fell down with a heaving heave.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

There were five black spears coming toward us.

Irving slashed down two and knocked one away with the hilt.

The other two, if avoided, will reach Beatrice.

Without hesitation, Irving slid himself into the line of fire.

One snagged his left arm and shifted its trajectory, and one stabbed into his left side and disappeared.

<blank>

"Irving! ！！！！！！！！"

<blank>

Beatrice screams in distress.

<blank>

Bibi! Focus! Leave us alone!

But! Irving! I have to heal my wounds! There's so much blood...!

Later! Right now... your work comes first! Don't worry...I'll protect you! ...... promised, didn't I?

"Irving ........."

'You...are the girl I've decided to protect! I will definitely ...... protect you!

Irving, Irving ...... Irving...!

<blank>

Beatrice, with tears in her eyes, constructs a formula and pours magic power into it.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It's like it's still going on, you know?"

I don't like it. Shall we go directly to them?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Kuso!"

<blank>

The situation is not good. The two vampires are in a completely playful mood. They can interrupt the summoning ceremony at any time.

We must only be distracted for these few minutes until Beatrice is ready.

<blank>

I glanced backward. Colin was trying desperately to raise his body.

He has injuries to both legs and cannot stand, but he is still ok....

<blank>

I felt irritation and anger as if my temples were burning.

What is okay with you! What is okay with Colin, who was rendered unable to walk!

I'm not standing here to torment Colin!

William traces his finger over the "control bead" on his breastplate and makes a resolution.

<blank>

Lombard, take care of this.

? Will? What are you talking about?"

I'm going to launch a suicide attack on these vampires now and get their attention off of me. You will maintain the line of defense that I have left!"

What are you talking about, Will? You'll never get there!"

I'll see what I can do. I'm going!

Will! Will!

<blank>

William shatters the control bead on the chest of his equipment and activates the magic circulation circuit.

The magic markings on all the equipment on the body emitted a stronger light than usual, indicating that the circuit had been activated.

<blank>

Wooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

William plows through a pack of shadow dogs with his equipment glowing strong.

<blank>

William ran through at a different level of speed than he had before.

The shadow dog that loomed in front of him was cut off in the face with a short sword that swung instantly and directly across the face.

He slashes off the front leg of a dog that jumps at him from the side and then strikes him down with his fist.

<blank>

With physical abilities that are unmatched up to now, he strikes down the shadow dogs one after another and gets close to the vampires.

<blank>

Colin, who had been watching from a distance, was transfixed by William's progress as he was clad in that light.

<blank>

No Willooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Don't use that so much!

<blank>

Colin was screaming, his face contorted in grief.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Essentially, the magical seal engraved on William and his team's equipment is a standard feature of the Protectorate's armor.

There is not much difference in the effectiveness of the equipment worn by those of lower rank and those worn by Howard and others of higher rank.

<blank>

The effect is mainly to strengthen defenses and physical abilities, but the degree of improvement is highly dependent on the ability of the wearer.

<blank>

This is because the improvement in ability is multiplied by the value of the magic power input to the original physical ability.

<blank>

A skilled person can use the smallest amount of magic, with high magical pressure, to hit a large magical value.

On top of that, magic power is passed through the magic seal to enable the use of a high level of enhanced capabilities.

In addition, the greater the increase in powerful ability, the greater the load on the body and mind, but techniques to minimize this load by momentarily turning on and off are also necessary.

<blank>

The strength of Howard and other upper-dan ranks is due to their base physical abilities as well as this skillful magic manipulation technique.

<blank>

On the other hand, those with immature physical abilities and magical skills, such as low-ranking members, cannot increase their ability values to such an extent.

This is due to their low physical ability and, of course, their inability to generate high magical power values to greatly improve their abilities.

<blank>

Of course, if you can enter a high magic value, you can expect a much higher improvement in ability.

But if those with low magical pressure do so, they will lose a large amount of magical quantity and lose their magical power all at once.

Rapid loss of magical power leads directly to loss of consciousness.

Also, physical enhancements that are not commensurate with one's abilities can cause more damage to the body than necessary.

<blank>

Naturally, the equipment is fitted with a control device to prevent this.

That is the "control bead".

<blank>

The "control bead" functions as a magic battery so that even those with little magic power can handle it, but it is also a breaker to suppress excessive supply of magic power.

<blank>

William is now shattering that "control bead" and over-supplying magic power to the equipment, forcing it to overboost.

It is time-limited superhumanization.

It is a forceful way to wield power beyond your stature for only a short time.

But the repercussions could burn out the central nervous system.

The cost of wielding such power is immeasurable.

<blank>

<blank>

William breaks through the pack of shadow dogs and closes in on the vampire.

Countless black spears instantly rush toward him, but he brushes them off, dodging and cutting them down.

As it was, I reached Doug's sight in one breath.

For a moment, Doug's eyes widened in surprise and he stared at William.

<blank>

At this point, William's capillaries were ruptured and he was bleeding from everywhere in his body due to the overload from the excessive supply of magic power.

<blank>

But William never stopped moving forward.

He brushed off the last chunk of the black spear with his left-hand kite shield and then plunged his right-hand shortsword directly into Doug's chest.

The next moment, Doug disappeared from the spot and moved behind William.

Doug's fingernail extended long like a blade, and he sharply poked his five knuckles together to drive them into William's back.

William quickly twisted his body quickly to the left and played the claw with his kite shield once again.

Riding the momentum, he swung his short sword horizontally to the left further.

Doug ducked it under his nose by stepping back slightly.

William switches short swords and slashes to the right.

Dag plays it with the claws of his blade, and again William slashes back, and Dag avoids it.

Doug takes a step, two steps, three steps back from William's continuous slashes, laughing merrily as he dodges and pops.

Conversely, William is growing impatient.

Blood comes pouring out of my eyes, nose, and ears.

For a moment, the claws flicked outward from the body, creating an opening in Doug's chest.

Again with all his might, William plunged his shortsword into the place where its heart was located.

<blank>

<blank>

It's a little bit more. Could have been... right?"

<blank>

A shortsword was stopped, piercing Doug's palm, which was spread out in front of him.

William felt his body rapidly losing strength.

<blank>

Doug pushed out his right hand, which was still pierced, and inserted his right hand to the base of the shortsword and grabbed William's right hand by the cross hilt.

<blank>

What? Are we done? That was kind of fun."

<blank>

With a giggle, he grabbed William's right hand, twisted it up by the wrist, and crushed his fist.

<blank>

Gahhhh!

<blank>

William dropped to one knee on the spot.

Blood was dripping from his body as if he was sweating profusely, and a pool of blood had formed at his feet.

I had no strength left to even stand up.

<blank>

What? What? What is it? Doesn't it just look so delicious on its own?"

<blank>

Eliza approached them, placing her finger on her mouth greedily.

His cheeks are flushed and his eyes are moist, as if intoxicated by the smell of blood.

<blank>

I stood behind William, who was down on one knee in front of Doug, and stroked his cheek with both hands, oohing and ahhing over his blood, which had gotten all over my palm.

Eliza looked at her bloody hands and cleared her throat as if she couldn't stand it.

At once, he presses his palm, which is stained red with William's blood, against his face and licks up the blood as if devouring it.

<blank>

Oh no....yummy!"

<blank>

Eliza, her face smeared with William's blood, muttered with a woozy expression.

<blank>

"Hey, you know what? Can I have him? Can I eat him? Can I eat him? Can I have him? Can we...?"

"Hey, I thought we weren't supposed to let them die?"

<blank>

Doug pulled out a shortsword stuck in his right hand and struck it down, while looking up at Eliza and asking amusedly.

Not a single scar remains on his palm.

<blank>

Doug's teasing! Doug's teasing! That's okay! As long as you don't let him die! "Uh-oh."

<blank>

As she said this, Eliza instantly transformed the fingers of her own right hand into vicious claws.

He thrust it straight into William's back at once.

<blank>

GAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"

<blank>

The shock William received on his back caused him to turn his head.

Eliza lifted William's body with one hand as if to raise it above her head.

<blank>

Gah! Gah!"

<blank>

William goes over Eliza's head and coughs up blood.

Eliza stretches out her long tongue to catch and lick away the drops of blood that are dripping overhead.

<blank>

"Oh, that's good... that's good... give me some more, give me some more."

<blank>

Eliza moved the claw she was impaling William with carelessly.

<blank>

Gah! Ggahhhh! Ggghaaaaaaaaaah! ！！！！"

<blank>

All at once, blood poured out and literally rained down all over Eliza's body.

He receives it with his wide-open mouth, strokes it all over his body with his left hand, and licks it off with his long, outstretched tongue.

<blank>

Aaah! I want to squeeze all of you...! I'm throbbing, throbbing, throbbing...uuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhuuhu...I want to squeeze all of you...ahhhhh...ahhhhh...! You're too good! You look nice! Here we go!

<blank>

Eliza went in ecstasy, soaking in William's blood.

<blank>

<blank>

Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Will! Willooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！！"

<blank>

Colin screamed William's name in a voice that sounded like a scream.

Dragging his feet, unable to stand, he reaches forward to move on.

But the hand does not reach William.

Only Colin's cries for William echoed through the place.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The sun was getting very low in the sky.

The sky is reddish and shadows are long.

You can see the mark of the black spear in his side, thumping and pulsing as if he had another heart.

But I don't care about the pain.

My brothers used to say that when your fighting spirit is soaring, you forget about the pain, even if you are deeply wounded.　I see! I don't mind at all!　The corners of Irving's mouth hung up in a grin, revealing his ferocious canine teeth.

<blank>

Will's suicide attack on the vampire stopped the Black Spear from coming here.

But the front line is on the verge of collapse.

<blank>

Lombardo is holding back the shadow dogs with his tower shield, but the stone wall that Bibi had put up has been broken down considerably.

A shadow dog, which had entered through the gap, attached itself to Lombard and set its fangs on him.

There were four of them. They were biting my limbs and bleeding badly.

It was a wonder that he was still standing, but he was still trying to push back the shadow dog that was trying to get in through the gap.

<blank>

Two shadow dogs also attached themselves to Kate and pushed her body down.

It bites at my legs, holds my head down, and is about to bite me.

Dana is trying to get rid of the shadow dog, which is shaking its head while biting Kate's leg as if trying to bite it off, by slamming her spear into it.

<blank>

The shadow dog fangs at Dana as well, but she barely shakes it off.

But Dana's right tibia has been gouged out, boot by boot.

Dana is amazing to be able to move even with that!

<blank>

Helena has a wound on her head or forehead, and the left half of her face is red with blood.

Still, he continues to shoot arrows at Brutal Butt.

<blank>

The middle and lower children are still standing by the walls of the remaining training hall, holding shields around the injured children and spears protruding through the gaps to check the brute bats that are approaching from the sky.

<blank>

<blank>

And now, in front of Irving, two shadowdogs were running past the defense line.

<blank>

One is headed for me and the other for Bibi? I won't let that happen, you idiot!

Irving swears in his stomach and blocks the path of the two shadow dogs.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Irving Haggard was born and raised as the third son of the Haggard family.

His father, Harry Haggard, is the head of Amcam Group 4 of Amcam Group 12 and one of the mainstays of Amcam County, known as the "Golden Lion".

<blank>

His eldest son, Bert, is by all accounts the best warrior in Amscombe County.

The anecdote of "The Golden Wolf of Destruction" is not unknown to anyone in this country.

Now he is out of the country and Irving has not seen his face for the last two years.

But it has remained his childhood dream and goal.

<blank>

One former knight rider above me showed his ability and made a name for himself on a different frontier than Amcam in the west.

The nickname "The Golden Vampire Slayer" made Irving proud every time he heard it.

<blank>

<blank>

Irvin is the son of a genuine Amcam warrior who grew up watching his father and older brother.

Now there is an obstacle looming before us that must be smashed.

I could feel something hot coming up from the bottom of my heart.

I have Bibi behind me, who I have to protect! There's no way I'm letting you guys through!

I licked up her upper lip with my tongue, and a smile came out of my mouth without my permission.

As he poised himself low, like a crouching start, his bright dark blonde hair, characteristic of the Haggard family, swayed, and his umber wolf eyes, also characteristic of the family, flashed with a golden light.

<blank>

He dashed forward with his left hand, dragging his longsword in his right hand as he kicked the ground.

The shadow dog, running one body length ahead of the other of the two dogs, decided to target Irving and came straight at him.

<blank>

The shadow dog opened its mouth and jumped to bite Irving.

Irving pulled his left arm back once, timed it right, and drove his own left fist into the shadow dog's mouth.　Irving's arm was twisted into the shadow dog's mouth up to the shoulder.

The fangs of the shadow dog bite repeatedly into my second arm, gulp gulp gulp gulp.

<blank>

Irving's left arm caught the momentum of the shadow dog's leap, and his body was swung directly to the left side.

The other shadow dog tried to get past Irving's right side, but Irving, spinning to the left, kept his longsword in his right hand and slammed it into the shadow dog's paw, letting the centrifugal force do the work.

Kageinu's front legs were gouged out by his own momentum and the impact of the slash with the longsword, and he sprawled on the spot.

Damn it! I can't cut off the leg! I'm not strong enough!

BUT! The dog on my left arm is chewing on my arm and it's already starting to bubble. He'll choke soon!

It was worth it to give him my left arm! And another one!

<blank>

Irving threw down his longsword and rolled to the other shadow dog with the shadow dog biting his left arm.

He puts his arm around Kageinu's neck and tries to tighten it, but Kageinu bites him on the right arm and drags him away.

<blank>

Geez! You bastard! Grow up! Aah!

<blank>

The shadow dog stretches over Irving, bites him and shakes its head as if trying to bite off his right arm alone.

<blank>

<blank>

Irving! Irving!!!!"

Leave it alone, Vivi! I'll take care of this! You, do your job! Do your job!

<blank>

Irving shouted to Beatrice as the shadow dog's fangs gouged the flesh of his arm, wetting his face with his own blood that was dripping down.

<blank>

Oh, Irving...!

<blank>

When Beatrice bit her lip as she poured out her magic, the magic circle lit up.

<blank>

I'm here! ...I'm in!"

<blank>

The magic circle was filled with the magical power necessary to activate the summoning formula.

<blank>

I'm going to get it done! Bibby! Bring me Suzy ----!!!!"

<blank>

Irving's cries echoed through the place.

Beatrice chants a blessing for the activation of the summoning technique as it is.

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude. I seek and I appeal to you. My dependents, answer my call and appear before me! Kelm eigo spero eude! I seek and I appeal! Come! Algernon! Bring me Sue!

<blank>

The summoning line shone with a dazzling light.

The light rose up to envelop the summoner's camp, then turned around yukkuri and thinned out toward the center.

<blank>

Irving looks up at that pillar of light.

Dana, Mary, and Lombardo turn around.

Colin, Kate, Willie, and everyone else who is still conscious are watching, gulping without a word.

<blank>

Sensing some sign, the shadow dogs stopped moving and roared at the light.

The two vampires also give a sharp look.

All present gazed at the pillar of light.

<blank>

<blank>

Eventually, the light faded away and a figure appeared.

<blank>

Her red hair, gathered into two small pick-tails, was lovely and shone like rubies through the sunlight.

The young grass-colored one-piece dress was cool, the skirt softly dancing in the wind, and the ruffles tucked into the hem of the dress swayed and danced.

<blank>

Around her waist, however, she wore a sword belt and two swords that did not resemble such girlish attire.

<blank>

His knitted boots are snugly together, and at his chest, where he stands straight, he holds his hands together and places them on his hands as if he is carefully scooping up a small animal.

The rodent in its palms kikked and squeaked.

<blank>

Aaah, Algernon! Sue!

<blank>

Beatrice called out one animal and one name with tears in her eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I was a little bit alarmed because you used summoning magic so grandiose, I was wondering what kind of powerful followers would come! What is it? It's a girl!

I guess it's a little disappointing, isn't it? But since you went to all this trouble to bring me here, I guess I should be on the lookout, right?"

<blank>

Eliza threw William, whom she had caught in her right claw.

He is sent flying 2-3 meters and rolled over, but William is already unconscious.

<blank>

I'm just a human being, you know? We're only human, right?"

<blank>

Eliza cowered at Doug's discouraging words.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Algernon jumped down from Susie's palm and ran to Beatrice.

They squeak and snort and seem proud of their accomplishments.

<blank>

Un! Arjanon! Well done, you did great!

<blank>

Beatrice holds Algernon close and rubs her cheek as she works.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy stood in front of one of them and one of the animals, looking around in amazement.

<blank>

"...what? This?"

<blank>

Suzy's eyes see children covered in blood.

In front of me is Carl, and in front of me is Irving.

A little further away is Mia, Lombardo, Dana and Helena!

<blank>

"What? What... is this?"

<blank>

And Shadowdog, who had been biting Irving, snarled, bared his fangs, and leaped toward Suzy.

<blank>

Beatrice could see the shadow dog slip past her and jump on Suzy.

But the next moment, the shadow dog is gone.

I think I heard a "bang" right in front of me.

Susie's left wrist points outward as if she had paid something.

A shuddering sound came from the right side of the room.

Looking in the direction to my right, I saw a cloud of dust a couple of hundred feet away.

Although it is too far away to see clearly, it looks as if the ground has been gouged out and several animal-like legs are sticking out of the ground.

And that too at least 5 meters apart.

<blank>

<blank>

"...dead weight? What's that? Screw you! ！！！！！！"

<blank>

Suzy spoke the words as if to spit them out, undoing her hair strings and shaking her head.

The unraveled hair spread out and golden light danced in the setting sun.

<blank>

I will not let anyone die in front of me! No one is going to die in front of me!

<blank>

Suzie Cloud, her red jade hair shimmering, said.



<blank>

----------------

I am ... Suzy Cloud!

Next time "Suzy Cloud comes forward"
