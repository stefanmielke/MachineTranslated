# Episode 72: The Vampire at Dawn, Part 2

Thank you for your patience.

In the end, it has exceeded 20,000 characters＾＾；；

<b>

There are some very cruel expressions.

Please be cautious if you are not good with such things or feel uncomfortable.

----------------

<b>

"Hmm, it seems I can move my body a bit now."

"Ugh, my fingertips are still trembling, though..."

"It can't be helped; after all, Nosori-kun is an old man, so don't overdo it, okay?"

"Despite the kind words, why does your expression look so mischievous, hmm??!!"

<b>

"The teachers are—too fast at recovering—. I—still—don't want to move—yet—."

"Hmm, even though you were almost a vampire's prey, you still lack a sense of urgency."

"I can't believe you are a human facing a life-threatening crisis."

"Well, that's just the charm of you, my assistant, so it can't be helped."

"Hmm, it can't be helped."

"It can't be helped."

"Uh, umm—you're being very rude—teachers—!"

<b>

"Now, let's set aside the trivial matters."

"Is that how you treat it as trivial?!"

"If we keep going like this, it will be a bit troublesome."

"That's right; the knight's battery said they lost more than half in the initial attack. There aren't any healers left either. Seiwashi-kun, can't we do something about this?"

"Hmm, that battery requires a proper adapter, so even if we try to charge it directly, it would be too inefficient and just take time without helping in an emergency."

"What a troublesome piece of equipment."

"I can use a bit of healing too, but since I'm not a cleric, I'm far from full recovery. More importantly, I have no magical power right now."

"Hmm, it's truly useless at this point."

"Ukiiiiii!!"

<b>

From the hastily dug trench, some people emerged, making a commotion.

The three doctors—Seiwashi Melchio, Morris Baltasar, and Nosori Kasubar—and Seiwashi's assistant, Joslyn Joslan.

<b>

"Teachers! Please hurry back into the trench! It's dangerous here!!"

<b>

Noticing the four who had come out of the trench, a member of the knight brigade rushed towards them.

<b>

"Oh, wait... you are from the third squad, right? Or were you the leader of the fourth squad?"

<b>

Morris tapped his forehead with his finger, searching his memory for the knight's name.

<b>

"I'm Norman Lance! Leader of the fourth squad. I'm from the spear escort unit!"

"Oh! That's right! You were the spear escort!"

"Teachers! More importantly, please evacuate quickly! The enemy is already here too!! Ugh! You!!"

<b>

As he announced his name, Norman Lance turned his back to the three doctors, crouched down, and activated "Boost Up," swinging his halberd.

With a dull metallic sound, a Cadmos Knight, charging straight at him, was blown away along with its shield by the halberd.

<b>

Immediately, Norman activated magic with the "Magic Activation Device" hidden in his boots.

<b>

"Air Ride"

He created a layer of compressed wind between his feet and the ground, moving as if gliding over the surface.

<b>

Norman closed the distance to the blown-away Cadmos Knight in one go, using the momentum of "Air Ride" to thrust his halberd deep into its chest.

Then, he burned the Cadmos Knight to ashes with the blue flames emitted from the spear tip.

A rejected cartridge flew out from Norman's shoulder, swirling in white smoke as it danced in the air.

<b>

Norman confirmed that the Cadmos Knight was defeated, relaxed his shoulders, and leaned on his raised halberd while catching his breath.

<b>

(Just to take one down, this much exhaustion... This is bad; these guys are definitely stronger. They are nothing like the undead we've faced before. One-on-one is far too unfavorable! At this rate, guarding the teachers will...)

<b>

Norman pushed up his slightly askew glasses and keenly felt the severity of the situation while catching his breath.

<b>

"What’s this? You seem quite dignified, don’t you?"

"It can't be helped; the opponent is stronger. I suppose the spear boy is at his limit."

"Y-you think so? If you believe that, please hurry back to the trench... If they come in numbers, I can't handle it alone..."

<b>

Norman readied his halberd again, cautiously sensing the surroundings, urging the three doctors to evacuate.

<b>

This place is within the defensive position created by the logistics unit.

<b>

However, even the fort-like position had suffered significant damage from the previous vampire attack.

Most of the tents set up inside had burned down, leaving only the wreckage.

<b>

At the center of this position, as a defense against magical attacks, a hole had been dug where the tents used to be, surrounded by walls to create a trench.

In there, the injured were being housed and treated. The three doctors were supposed to have been evacuated there as well.

But Norman noticed the doctors had somehow come outside, and he rushed over in a panic.

<b>

While the battalion leaders were maneuvering at the front, the enemy had already infiltrated the position.

What would happen if we allowed any more enemy incursions...?

Norman focused his gaze, tightening his grip on the halberd as he glared ahead.

<b>

"Hmm, but it seems we can't just sit around either."

<b>

Seiwashi murmured, squinting his eyes.

Norman felt his hair stand on end at the sudden presence that appeared.

<b>

"Oh? So you were hiding here too?"

<b>

A woman clad in a black night dress spoke, placing her right index finger to her lips and swaying her hips as she spoke cheerfully.

The moment Norman confirmed the woman—Electra—he enveloped his poised halberd in blue light and charged straight at her.

The charge, combining "Boost Up" and "Air Ride," propelled him forward as he thrust the spear tip towards Electra.

<b>

However, just as he thought he had thrust the spear tip into her, Electra's body flickered and vanished from the spot.

Norman immediately turned his body, digging his feet into the ground to halt his momentum, crouching down to stop and sense the surroundings.

<b>

"Well♪ You seem quite delicious too..."

<b>

A whisper, carrying a sweet scent from behind, wrapped around Norman's ears.

In a panic, Norman jumped back, sliding his body between the doctors and Electra to act as a shield.

<b>

"Ufu, how noble of you. That part of you is also quite nice, you know?"

<b>

With a cold smile, she raised her right hand, flipping it over palm-up to the height of her face. Then, her right hand was engulfed in flames.

As Electra waved her hand as if to brush it away, the flames stretched like a whip and attacked Norman.

<b>

The fiery whip coiled around Norman's side as if it had mass, slashing through his body.

Blown away, Norman was engulfed in flames, rolling to the feet of the doctors while screaming.

<b>

At the feet of the doctors, Norman's armor emitted white smoke, and he groaned in pain.

<b>

"It's been a while since I've seen an elf. I had fun with this boy, didn't I? This young lady here will surely entertain the master, so I will welcome her properly. As for the old men... it's quite unfortunate, but this is where we part ways. Unfortunately, it seems we don't share the same tastes. Hohoho..."

<b>

Electra narrowed her eyes, casting a lingering gaze over Norman, Seiwashi, and Joslyn, before glancing at Morris and Nosori, placing her hand over her mouth and letting out a small chuckle.

<b>

"Nosori-kun, it's unfortunate; it seems you've been rejected, hasn't it?"

"Morris-kun, do you realize you are included in this too?"

"I know! Good for you, Seiwashi-kun. You've received a passionate love call! You must feel lucky being a handsome man, right?!"

"Hmm, what a bothersome invitation indeed. I've always refused such self-serving invitations!"

"Ha! Handsome men sure say different things!"

<b>

<b>

With trembling hands, Norman finally reached for the activation switch of the medical kit attached to his waist.

With a loud hiss, the sound of high-pressure air burst forth, activating the healing magic.

Using up all the magical power stored, the now-empty cartridge was ejected from the device, and Norman finally managed to sit up.

<b>

(Damn it! Just receiving one hit used up an entire cartridge for recovery? The gap between us is too great!)

<b>

Standing up, Norman caught his breath while readjusting his halberd, aiming the spear tip at Electra.

Electra looked at him, smiling as if impressed.

<b>

"Y-you're protecting me, aren't you, knight!!"

<b>

Just as Norman positioned himself between Electra and Joslyn, Joslyn, overwhelmed with emotion, clasped her hands together and raised her voice.

<b>

"Huh? Ah... Of course. It is my duty to protect everyone."

<b>

Taken aback by the sudden voice from behind, Norman quickly reassured himself that this was just a natural occurrence.

<b>

"Did you hear that, teachers?! After all, those who are watching are noticing!! I am a maiden protected by the knight!!!"

<b>

"That's full of points to critique!"

"I don't even know where to start critiquing anymore."

"Hmm, it pains my heart to see my ailing disciple like this."

"Say whatever you want! I am the winner here!! I'm a winner!!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

Norman exhaled sharply, crouched down, and activated "Air Ride" again, gliding toward Electra.

With the halberd positioned to the left, Norman surged forward, swinging the spear tip enveloped in blue holy energy.

With a sound like crushed air, the crescent-shaped axe part was about to catch Electra when, once again, her body flickered and disappeared from the spot.

However, this time, he quickly sensed her presence again.

Using the momentum from the halberd swing, he turned his body to adjust his trajectory and pierced the new target with the spear tip.

<b>

With a clink, the spear tip hit something and stopped moving.

Electra, who had been standing in the darkness, extended her blood-colored claws like knives and caught Norman's thrust with them. Electra opened her eyes wide in apparent admiration, deepening her smile.

<b>

Clenching his teeth, Norman quickly pulled back the spear tip.

"Polearm Rapid Attack"

From Norman's gauntlet, cartridges wrapped in white smoke were continuously rejected.

Simultaneously, a flurry of thrusts from the halberd was unleashed. The spear tip attacked Electra at a speed that created afterimages.

<b>

However, Electra easily deflected them with her long red claws, which she gathered together like a blade, tilting her head with a playful smile.

<b>

Suddenly, Norman's thrust came to a halt. He coughed up blood, having been slashed diagonally across his back.

Electra had appeared beside Norman, her left hand's fingers piercing into his side.

The claws at her fingertips extended long like before, piercing through Norman's armored body as if it were paper, all five digging deep into him.

<b>

Electra slowly withdrew her claws, dragging them along Norman's body as she did so.

As she gazed at Norman, who was screaming in pain, she pulled her red claws free with a satisfying slickness.

Then, she began to run her tongue along each long claw, stained with Norman's blood, savoring the taste.

With each lick, her eyes grew more and more glistening with delight.

<b>

Norman, separated from Electra, struggled to support his crumbling body with the halberd, barely managing to hold on.

The five claws that had pierced him further damaged his internal organs.

Enduring the intense pain, Norman activated the medical kit around his waist again to treat his wounds.

He quickly finished the treatment, but while the used cartridges were ejected, his exhausted stamina did not return.

<b>

<b>

The healing techniques used by the clergy read the ether information of the target and recreate their original form, essentially a form of regeneration.

The effectiveness of this depends greatly on the user's skill, but in any case, it is a high-level art that only those who serve the gods can use.

<b>

On the other hand, among those who use other forms of magic, there are also healing spells available.

Many of these healing spells operate by manipulating bodily fluids and promoting cell activation, significantly enhancing the user's healing ability, but they often cannot restore lost stamina or blood.

<b>

Currently, the healing magic contained in the medical patch standardly equipped with the "Heavy Mobile Magic Armor" is of the latter type. Therefore, while it can heal wounds, it cannot restore lost blood or stamina.

<b>

Right now, Norman's wounds have finally closed. Even if he were to push for further healing, he wouldn't have the stamina to sustain it.

Healing wounds and regenerating lost blood both require stamina. Right now, he is barely standing due to the awakening effect of the healing magic.

In any case, the healing magic cartridge he just used is the last one. There is no way back.

<b>

However, even so, he cannot retreat from here.

Norman readied his halberd again, blinking his eyes with a determined gaze behind his glasses, directing the spear tip toward Electra.

Electra noticed Norman's gaze and smiled slyly, narrowing her eyes.

<b>

But just as Norman had made up his mind, someone placed a hand on his shoulder and stepped forward.

<b>

"Hmm, well done. I think you should take a little rest."

"S-sensei! This place is dangerous! Please step back quickly!!"

<b>

Seiwashi stopped Norman, taking a step forward.

<b>

"Oh? You couldn't hold back and came out, huh? Don't worry; I'll take care of you soon enough."

<b>

Electra spoke to Seiwashi while licking her blood-stained fingers.

<b>

"Hmm, the trees of Iroshio are filled with high concentrations of magical power. Normally, they should have considerable resistance to flames unleashed by magic. However, considering the magnitude and skill of the magic that burned them so easily without even a chant, it seems the original caster was quite powerful."

"…What does that have to do with anything?"

<b>

In response to Seiwashi's analysis, Electra's expression turned cold as she questioned what relevance it had.

<b>

"Hmm, I don't intend to do anything in particular. I just thought it would be appropriate for me to face you if you are going to use magic."

"…Is that so? It seems you have quite a bit to say about magic, huh? …Then, shall I play with my magic directly?"

<b>

"Hmm, then let the lecture begin."

<b>

In response to Seiwashi's words, Electra took out a small leather pouch and scattered the fangs contained within it around.

<b>

"First, let's play with these little ones for a bit, shall we? Hohoho..."

<b>

As she spread her arms wide, smiling, Electra laughed.

At that moment, Morris stepped forward.

<b>

"Hmm, can you handle it, Morris-kun?"

"Of course!"

<b>

Morris snapped the blade of the shovel-like "Earth Up" into a hoe shape and swung it down, driving it into the ground.

As he did, cracks spread from where it was stabbed to the area where the fangs were scattered, causing the ground to collapse one after another.

<b>

Seeing this, Electra raised an eyebrow in confusion, stopping her movements.

<b>

"Hmm, you look puzzled. That magic is a summoning spell that utilizes the magical power absorbed from the ley lines, using dragon fangs as a catalyst. The caster uses only a small amount of magical power for activation, making it incredibly economical."

"And that's where this 'Earth Up' comes in! This can also manipulate the flow of magical power underground. Too bad! The magical power around that catalyst is completely empty right now!! Gahaha!"

"Hmm, since there's no magical burden on the caster, if there's no ley line magic, it can't be used."

<b>

Electra narrowed her eyes, staring coldly at Seiwashi.

<b>

"So, that's how it is… But you don't think you've sealed my hands with that, do you?"

<b>

As she said this, Electra lightly raised her right hand, starting to swirl flames within it.

<b>

"Hmm, of course not. But I wouldn't recommend unnecessary actions."

"Speak as you wish!!"

<b>

As Electra shouted, she swung her hand vigorously, throwing the flames from her palm toward Seiwashi.

The flames became fireballs, rushing toward Seiwashi with a loud roar.

<b>

However, before the fireball could touch Seiwashi, it suddenly brightened in mid-air and then extinguished as if it had burned out.

Electra's eyes widened in shock.

<b>

"Hmm, the 'Magic Accumulation Array' can be used in this way too."

<b>

At Seiwashi's feet, a thin brass-colored stick-like object had formed a long circle around them, separating Electra from them.

<b>

"W-what is this… When did this happen…"

<b>

Norman, leaning on his halberd to the left, pushed up his glasses with his right hand, staring in astonishment at the shimmering brass line at Seiwashi's feet.

<b>

"Hmm, thanks to the spear boy distracting her."

<b>

Saying this, Seiwashi threw several adjuster cases he had been holding.

The empty cases rolled on the ground.

<b>

"Hmm, now the 'Magic Accumulation Array' is absorbing the vast magical power of Iroshio while simultaneously releasing the concentrated magical power here. As a result, this place is now in a state where it has a magical barrier strong enough to withstand ordinary magic. I must say, this is quite powerful."

<b>

Seiwashi remarked that it would be impossible to break through with ordinary magic.

Hearing this, Electra furrowed her brow, narrowing her eyes at Seiwashi.

<b>

"…Is that so? Then, wouldn't it be fine to just stroke it directly?"

<b>

As Electra said this, she extended her fingers, making them knife-like in length, licking her index finger as she cast a sidelong glance at Seiwashi.

Then, she smoothly disappeared from that spot, as if melting into the darkness.

However, just as Electra vanished, a loud crack echoed.

<b>

"Ugh?!"

<b>

There was Electra, letting out a small scream as she was pushed back, as if she had been struck by something.

<b>

"What… what did you… What are you doing?!!!"

<b>

Electra furrowed her brow, sending a sharp glare at Seiwashi as she pressed her right hand against her body, raising her voice to question him.

The fingertips of her right hand were sizzling, emitting wisps of white smoke as if they had been burned.

<b>

"Hmm, I wouldn't recommend carelessly becoming incorporeal and invading there. As I said earlier, that place is currently in a state where concentrated magical power is being released. Well, it's a combination with 'Earth Up' that can manipulate the ley lines. Since it draws out the powerful magical power of Iroshio and circulates it, it's essentially exposing the flow of the ley lines."

<b>

Seiwashi and Morris smirked, lightly bumping their fists together.

Electra silently directed a cold glare at them.

<b>

"Hmm, beings like you who are astral in nature cannot cross this flow. If you force yourself into it, your mana will be trapped in the ley line's torrent, and you will dissipate into the void without returning to the three realms. Especially if you are incorporeal. Well, feel free to test it if you wish."

"…………"

<b>

Electra listened silently to Seiwashi's words, scanning the area, which was guarded by the barrier.

<b>

"…So? What do you intend to do after this? It seems to me that you are already at an impasse…"

<b>

Returning her gaze to Seiwashi, Electra narrowed her eyes, placing her hand to her mouth as she chuckled softly.

<b>

"This is how it goes!!"

<b>

In the palm of Nosori, who shouted that, was a small object resembling a torch, spewing sparks.

He was also wearing dark black sunglasses over his eyes.

Moreover, it became apparent that everyone present was wearing similar black glasses as well.

<b>

As Electra's eyes widened in surprise, Nosori threw the torch to the ground with all his might.

With a loud bang, the torch exploded, enveloping the area in a blinding flash of light.

<b>

"W-what is this?!!… Ugh!!"

<b>

Electra shielded her face with her arms to avoid the blinding light, but the intense glare pierced through even that, filling her world with white.

By the time Electra's vision returned, the people who had been there were already gone.

<b>

"……What on earth just happened…"

<b>

Narrowing her eyes to check her vision, Electra blinked and slowly scanned the area, but there was no sign of anyone nearby.

<b>

"Hmph, so it was within that…"

<b>

Electra murmured, directing her gaze toward the trench wall, as if she could see through it.

Then, placing her hands on her hips, she let out a deep, quiet sigh, dropping her shoulders slightly.

<b>

"It can't be helped… Originally, I intended to surround everyone here so they wouldn't escape… Well, it's fine; for now, stay hidden. This reckless barrier won't last until dawn anyway. In any case, there is no escape…"

<b>

Electra narrowed her eyes, stroking her mouth with her finger. The fingers that should have been burned had already returned to a beautiful white shape.

Then she snapped her fingers beside her face.

Suddenly, small flames lit up on either side of Electra.

<b>

The flames danced and flickered, strong enough to illuminate Electra's feet, about the size of a human fist.

As if conducting an orchestra, she elegantly spread her arms, and flames began to emerge around Electra in succession.

Eventually, they lined up to encircle the trench, flickering powerfully as if to say they would miss nothing.

<b>

Electra gazed at the flames with satisfaction, bringing her white fingers back to her mouth and licking them again.

<b>

"…When we meet next time, I will squeeze everything out of you, you know? So look forward to it."

<b>

Then Electra laughed aloud.

Eventually, her body flickered and disappeared into the forest's darkness, leaving only her laughter echoing between the trees.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

"Hmm, I feel a chill."

"Ah, I can somewhat sense that. It's definitely a love call."

<b>

Seiwashi hugged his shoulders, shivering slightly.

<b>

"Phew, that was a close one."

"Indeed, it was a hair's breadth away."

"Hmm, for now, it seems we were spared."

<b>

Sitting in the trench, the three doctors let out sighs of relief.

However, hearing this, Norman took off the sunglasses he had been wearing and, adjusting his glasses, exclaimed in surprise.

<b>

"What are you talking about?! It was the teachers who were overwhelming her the whole time!!"

<b>

Morris sighed and replied.

<b>

"Well, that was cutting it close. Right, Seiwashi-kun?"

"Hmm, if that 'Great Firestorm' had been used earlier, the barrier would have definitely been breached. If that had happened, we would have been turned to ash. Fortunately, they seemed to want to capture us."

"If those fangs that were scattered had been outside the range of 'Earth Up,' it would have been over!"

"Hmm, and more importantly, that barrier was only good for about ten more minutes. Either way, we were in a tight spot."

"Is that so…"

<b>

"Fortunately, the 'Spirit Shock Flash Bomb' I used at the end worked somehow! I brought it as a distraction for magical beasts, and it seems to work well on astral beings too! Uhyohyo!"

<b>

Of course, it only worked because it caught them off guard, Nosori laughed.

<b>

"Well then, in any case, it would be best to do what can be done now. Joseline, come here; this is a job suited for you."

"Yes? A job suited for me?"

"Indeed, so Spear, why don't you lie down here for a moment?"

"Huh? Me?"

"Yes, your injury is merely closed up; it is far from healed. You must be struggling to stand, am I wrong?"

"...No, that is correct. But still..."

"Good, just lie down already. And Joseline, he is your knight, right? I think it would be good for you to heal him yourself."

"Huh? Sensei, I've been saying that I have no magical power for a while now."

"Exactly, that's why I prepared this for you."

<b>

"What... what is this?! Why am I being made to wear this bracelet?! And it's got a chain attached to it! It feels like I'm some sort of prisoner!"

"It's just a thin little chain, not something to fuss about."

"Hmm, that chain is connected to a 'magic power accumulation array.' It will supply magic power according to your needs, allowing you to focus solely on healing. There are many injured people here, so I hope you can get to work quickly."

"Wait, wait! Are you saying that I can't move from here?!"

"Of course. You should assume there won't be any time to rest until there are no more people here with serious injuries."

"Wha?! Huh?! There are over 20 seriously injured people, you know?!"

"The dedicated healers are gone. The magic users have their limits with magic power! There are also limits to the number of medical patches available! It’s up to you, Assistant, to do your best!"

<b>

“W-What?! I haven’t slept at all! I’ve been up all night! Are you saying I can’t rest at all?!”

“Everyone here is in the same boat! It’d be a big mistake to think only you get to rest!”

“Hmph, the three of us will be stuck here adjusting the flow of magic from the 'magic power accumulation array' to match your magic quality. You'll be the one doing the healing from there.”

“Besides, the 'health recovery' magic used to enhance healing is high in magic consumption compared to its effectiveness, making it quite inconvenient!”

“That’s why we’re supplying the magic power! You can use it freely without worrying about your own magic, just do your job until you collapse!”

“There’s no time for you to play around!”

“Let’s make sure you work hard, shall we?”

“Y-You’re all such heartless people!!”

<b>

In the dim trench, the brass-colored chains glimmered, illuminating the surroundings.

Within that, Joslyn's pained cries echoed.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Kuh, kuh! Kihi, heehee! Hah! Ahh!!"

<b>

The darkness of the forest split as a blade flashed.

With one, two, three swift strikes, the heavy blows of a machete-like great sword were sharp and heavy.

Yet, Kyle Arvine deflected them one after another with his knight sword enveloped in blue holy energy.

<b>

Then, a blue sword flash traced through the darkness.

The brown-skinned woman, Joel, jumped back to avoid it.

However, blood splattered vigorously from the wounds on her brown skin.

Looking closely, she had multiple wounds across her body, with blood dripping from everywhere.

<b>

The brown-skinned woman… Joel, flushed in the face, occasionally let out lustful breaths from her mouth, sending heated glances toward Kyle, who stood at the tip of her sword.

Kyle held his sword up to the right side of his face, pointing the tip at Joel.

Without a moment's pause, Joel stepped in at a speed that ordinary people couldn't catch.

Kyle deflected Joel's sharply swung great sword with the belly of his knight sword, then slashed the tip toward Joel's ample chest.

With a high-pitched cry of pleasure, Joel let out a "kihi" as fresh blood splattered. However, immediately after, her figure flickered and vanished.

At the same time, Kyle's figure also flickered and vanished, and in the next moment, blood splattered in the air.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

Letting out a scream, Joel appeared, her back slashed diagonally.

Standing behind her was Kyle, having slashed upward with his knight sword.

Kyle quickly readied his stance again, but his expression was harsh as he breathed heavily.

<b>

"Ah, ahh, kihi! Good... You're not bad either! Hehe!! Let's do more... more!!"

"…I just want to finish this quickly."

<b>

The sound of swords cutting through the air echoed as Joel's lascivious laughter reverberated among the trees.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Just beside them, a massive black shadow loomed.

Howard swung his black great sword horizontally like a full swing, cutting it down.

The massive black ancient dragon skull, taller than a person, was forcefully knocked aside. Howard then called out behind him.

<b>

"Conrad! It's coming!!"

"Dammit! This big thing is relentless!!"

<b>

Conrad ducked under the undead that had been knocked aside and countered another charge with his battle axe, spitting out curses.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

Tony Easton barely dodged the long tail of the approaching undead, which was like a black wall.

At the same time, he caught the small stones that the tail had knocked aside with his kite shield. However, he was pushed back by the force and nearly knocked down, but he managed to hold on.

Then, he quickly regained his stance, preparing for the next attack.

<b>

This back-and-forth had already lasted over an hour.

The opponent was just too tough.

If they could land a big hit and break through even one of their ranks, the current situation could turn in their favor, but even though they were holding back, the undead were quickly repairing any damage done, which was becoming increasingly frustrating.

Tony and Kyle might be reaching their limits, Howard thought, glancing at the two.

<b>

"Master, it's definitely that chain. It's sending the absorbed miasma through that chain."

"Hmm, so that's where it is."

"How petty of them to use such tricks!"

<b>

Behind the massive undead, a woman wrapped in chains wore a thin smile.

The woman wrapped in chains… Marina swayed the chains around her body as if they were feathers.

Moreover, several of the chains extending from Marina were connected to the giant undead.

<b>

"That woman is drawing miasma from deep underground and sending it to the bones through the chains."

<b>

Gilberto, with his eye patch's magic seal glowing, seemed to have finally caught sight of the magical flow, informing Howard.

<b>

<b>

Now, Howard and the others were completely separated from the main force of the knight brigade.

Surrounding them were three giant undead, "Dark Scale Danasaur," keeping a certain distance while encircling them.

Whenever Howard and the others tried to evade, the undead would maneuver to block them, and if they attempted to attack, they would coordinate and defend.

They were experiencing a frustrating time where their distance was expertly manipulated.

<b>

In a way, it was just like the undead that had initially attacked them.

They were merely trying to pin Howard and the others down here.

Marina, who stood behind the massive black undead, wore a thin smile, quietly observing Howard and the others.

<b>

"What's wrong, Howard? Are you out of breath?"

"Don't be ridiculous! You look unsteady yourself!"

"Ha! I'm just gathering a bit of strength! Who do you think I am?!"

"Hah! Then it's about time to end this, right?!"

"Of course!!"

<b>

Howard, with the class of "Warlord," raised the morale and combat power of the entire unit just by being there.

Even though he had retired, Conrad, once a "Herculean Lord," similarly boosted the knight brigade's attack power.

The reason the knight brigade had been able to hold their own against the horde of undead was largely due to their presence.

<b>

And now, Howard and the others were about to use one of their unique skills.

Howard and Conrad's magical power was being concentrated within them, increasing in density.

<b>

<b>

But at that moment, a loud sound echoed as fireballs approached.

Tony Easton quickly raised his kite shield to block them.

The successive fireballs hit him like a barrage of giant hammers, delivering a tremendous impact through the shield.

Tony gritted his teeth, letting out small groans as he endured, but eventually, he was overwhelmed by the force of the fireballs and blown away.

His body, engulfed in flames, slammed against the rocky surface, rolling over.

<b>

"Ughhh!!"

"Tony!!!"

<b>

Kyle turned and shouted toward Tony.

Tony rolled on the ground, emitting white smoke, but eventually began to slowly rise.

Seeing this, Kyle let out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"You bastard! Where did that come from?!"

<b>

Kyle, while keeping an eye on Joel, scanned the surroundings cautiously. Suddenly, a woman in a black night dress emerged from the darkness.

The woman… Electra, with her right hand still extended from firing the fireball, was licking her left hand, which was stained with blood.

<b>

"…! That blood?!!"

<b>

Kyle's eyes widened as he noticed the blood on Electra's hand.

Electra narrowed her eyes at Kyle, dramatically shrugging her shoulders.

<b>

“...You!”

<b>

Electra smiled at Kyle, who was glaring at her, then lowered her right hand, turning her face towards Joel, who was nearby, and spoke.

<b>

“Oh? Joel, I had my eye on that gentleman over there.”

“Hehe, really?! This guy’s actually pretty fun to deal with, isn’t he?”

“Isn’t your target the one over there? This one should be left to me.”

“Wait, that’s not fair, Electra! I was the one playing first! It’s terrible to steal him away! Let me play a bit longer!”

<b>

With a frown, Joel showed an expression like a child who had his toy taken away, prompting Electra to let out a big sigh.

<b>

“...I understand. I’m sorry, Joel. This one is yours to enjoy.”

“Really?! Awesome!! Hehe!”

“In return...”

<b>

Saying this, Electra moved behind Joel.

<b>

“...You’ll make up for this later, won’t you?”

<b>

Electra continued to run her fingers along the wound on Joel’s back.

Joel arched his back, letting out a loud scream and shaking his body.

Then, looking back at Electra over his shoulder, he nodded slightly with teary eyes.

Seeing this, Electra narrowed her eyes in satisfaction, lovingly caressing Joel’s cheek with her long fingers before disappearing into the darkness.

<b>

As Electra vanished, Joel immediately brought his greatsword to his lips, curling his mouth into a smile as he licked the blade. And then...

<b>

“...Hehe, alright! Let’s have even more fun!!”

<b>

With that, he raised his greatsword toward Kyle and charged forward.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

A massive black dragon skull was deflected by Howard using the "Grand Divider." Suddenly, a fireball appeared from the darkness, hurtling toward his back.

Howard deftly evaded the rapidly approaching fireballs without looking back.

The fireballs, missing their target, struck the massive undead black bone creature, sending its heavy body flying.

<b>

With gleaming gray eyes, Howard turned to slash at the last incoming fireball, dissipating the magical flames. He followed through with a sweeping strike, cutting through the darkness beyond.

The sound of a hard impact echoed as Howard's strike met the five sharp claws, resembling red knives, that attempted to intercept him.

<b>

“...Ugh!”

<b>

With a pained groan, the woman clad in a black knight dress—Electra—leaped back, clearly struggling.

Howard seized the opportunity and lunged forward for another strike.

The strike, infused with concentrated magical energy, distorted the surrounding air and not only deflected the red claws but shattered them entirely.

Electra, propelled back, extended her left arm in place of her broken right claw, aiming her five fingers at Howard, elongating the red claw toward him.

The rapidly extending spear-like red claw grazed Howard before embedding itself into the black ground behind him.

Howard’s leather armor emitted smoke as it burned where it had been touched.

The red claw, planted firmly in the ground, glowed with a fiery hue, scorching the earth around it.

<b>

Electra smirked, showcasing her claw's red hue, which was akin to fire itself, and taunted Howard with a sinister grin.

<b>

She retracted her left claw and launched it at Howard again at high speed.

Four of her fingers aimed to scorch Howard's limbs,

while the last one targeted his eye, glistening with a gray light.

<b>

However, Howard adjusted his grip on the sword's ricasso and spun the large blade like a baton, sending the claws flying away.

The force of the spinning sword sliced through the air, obliterating the red claws,

and the final one shattered against Howard's left backfist.

<b>

As her claws were effortlessly destroyed, Electra's eyes widened in shock as she was pushed back by the force of the air swirling around them.

Yet at that moment, Howard had already disappeared from Electra's sight.

She sensed his presence behind her just as she felt a strong impact on her body.

<b>

“Agh!!”

<b>

Howard, having smoothly moved behind Electra, maintained the momentum of his spinning greatsword and swung it like a hammer, slamming the crossguard into her side.

<b>

Electra was launched backward, her limbs digging into the earth as she quickly regained her footing.

Her wounded side emitted smoke, and the damage she had sustained was not healing immediately.

Pressing a hand to her wound, Electra furrowed her brow, sweat pouring down her face.

She realized the immense magical power Howard contained, its density palpable after receiving a direct blow from him.

<b>

This was bad. If they exchanged blows directly, he possessed enough strength to obliterate them.

Howard was fundamentally different from the knight brigade she had previously toyed with.

<b>

Electra, rising cautiously, glared at Howard.

<b>

But ultimately, he was just a human.

As initially planned, if they continued their relentless assault day and night, he would eventually wear down.

Once weakened, it would be easy to finish him off.

With such power on their side, consuming it would provide a great boon for them.

<b>

Considering all that, Electra swayed her standing body gently and lifted the corners of her mouth into a broad smile.

<b>

"How wonderful it is to have a gentleman with such power here..."

"..."

"What do you say? At the end of your life, why not indulge in the greatest pleasures this world has to offer?"

<b>

Electra opened her chest, which formed a large V, and while shaking the drooping fullness, she revealed the raised tips.

Furthermore, she pushed her hips forward, revealing her legs through the deep slit in her dress that cut down to her waist, displaying her white lower body to Howard.

<b>

Electra further opened the slit and provocatively traced her exposed thigh with her fingertips while glancing at Howard with lustful eyes.

<b>

"Have you ever encountered a woman like me? Come now... Experience the finest woman. All the pleasures of this world are here. I will... melt within you..."

<b>

While gazing up at Howard with glistening eyes, Electra opened the slit even more and inserted her fingers deep into the roots of her thighs, producing a moist sound.

<b>

However, Howard kept his sword aimed at Electra while quietly exuding his fighting spirit.

And then, he murmured a single word.

<b>

"Unfortunately... I have never met a woman better than Sonia!"

<b>

Electra's eyes widened at Howard's words of rejection.

Reacting to Howard's expanding fighting spirit, she took a step back.

<b>

Immediately, Electra relaxed her shoulders and slowly shook her head with a sigh, as if to say it was unfortunate.

<b>

"How disappointing... But it would be best to give it a moment... We shall meet again later... at that time..."

<b>

Saying this, she melted into the darkness with an expression that could not erase her lust.

Electra began to dissolve into black mist from the edges of her body and was about to disappear into the forest.

<b>

"You're lukewarm! Vampire!!"

<b>

Howard illuminated the magical sigils engraved on his equipment and leaped forward towards the black mist, swinging down the blow of the 'Grand Divider' that emitted blue light.

<b>

"Gyahhhhhhh!!!"

<b>

Letting out a scream that seemed to come from deep within, Electra writhed and rolled on the ground.

Her shoulder was deeply slashed, and her right arm was nearly severed from her body.

Her knight dress was torn, spilling out her ample bosom as Electra continued to scream while spitting blood.

<b>

"Electra?!"

<b>

Joel, who was engaged in a battle with Kyle, widened his eyes and shouted at Electra's sudden change.

<b>

"Lord Cloud... Did you just slash an incorporeal opponent?!"

<b>

Kyle was astonished by the act of cutting down Howard’s opponent, which was beyond common sense.

<b>

"Joel! Take Electra and fall back!!"

<b>

The woman wrapped in chains… Marina shouted towards Joel from behind the large black undead.

<b>

Marina was also aware.

She recognized the power of Howard, Conrad, and Gilberto.

<b>

She understood that they possessed significant strength.

While she took on the role of separating and restraining them from the knight order, the closer she got, the more her core chilled at their out-of-reach power.

However, no matter how great their power, if they were shackled, they could not unleash their full potential.

For that reason, she planned to encircle the weaklings in the back so they couldn't escape, binding them to their yoke.

That way, they would eventually exhaust themselves, unable to escape or utilize their strength.

<b>

All that remained was to trample over them easily.

<b>

So, there was no need to confront them head-on; it was enough to retreat for now.

<b>

"Morning will soon come. The night will end! Let's pull back for a moment."

<b>

Yes, all she needed to do was pull back for a moment at dawn.

Then she could return immediately and continue the war of attrition.

<b>

As Marina wore a cold smile on her face and gave the order to withdraw, Howard drove the black great sword, 'Grand Divider,' into the ground and shouted.

<b>

"Don't think you can escape forever, vampire!!"

"You've been annoying us repeatedly with your sly little antics!!"

<b>

Conrad also shouted, not hiding his irritation.

<b>

"But that ends here! From this point on, you shall not leave this land!!"

"...I don't think that's something you can do anything about."

<b>

At Howard's words, Marina frowned in displeasure and told him they couldn't interfere with their actions.

But instead of responding to her, Howard gathered strength in the hand gripping the 'Grand Divider' that was embedded in the ground.

<b>

"I shall make this land my territory! Break through! Grand Divider!! 'The Monarch's Territory'!!"

<b>

In response to Howard's shout, the magic sigils engraved on the 'Grand Divider' glowed even brighter.

The brilliance of the great sword, thrust into the ground, spread outward from Howard.

It expanded over a radius of more than 100 meters, filling the land with the vast magical power Howard had been refining.

<b>

Simultaneously, power was poured into those within that range.

Kyle felt the overflowing strength and swung his sword.

The flashing blade showed unprecedented sharpness, and he was amazed by its own cutting edge.

<b>

Tony stood up and received the blow from the approaching large undead head-on, surprised by the minimal damage he sustained.

<b>

Norman, emerging from the trench, dispelled the magical flames surrounding him with a swing of his halberd infused with holy energy.

<b>

Cedric Meyer cleaved the approaching Cadmus Knight in one stroke.

<b>

Cornell Walrich single-handedly knocked back several Cadmus Knights.

<b>

Now, within the territory that Howard had opened, the combat power of the knights had significantly increased.

<b>

"With this! Be crushed!! 'Grand Fortress'!!"

<b>

Conrad slammed his gigantic battle axe into the ground, unleashing his skill.

The magical power released from the struck battle axe spread, creating ripples in the earth, and birthed a massive wall made of magical energy around them.

The generated wall crushed three enormous undead at once and thickly surrounded them.

<b>

<b>

Howard used the power of the 'Grand Divider' to create a temporary territory and then built Conrad's wall on top of it, forming a solid barrier in a confined space.

This wall would obstruct enemies attacking from the outside and prevent those inside from escaping—a robust barrier. It was an absolute defense created for a brief time within a limited space.

<b>

<b>

"With this, you lot can no longer escape! Submit!!"

<b>

Conrad, having exhausted his refined magical power, took a deep breath.

<b>

"You despise the sunlight, always hiding in the shadows."

<b>

Howard stated that they were akin to pests.

At those words, Marina furrowed her brow deeply and glared at Howard.

<b>

"Annoyingly, higher beings walk about freely even during the day. However, only the dawn's light will truly destroy you."

<b>

Howard pulled the 'Grand Divider' from the ground and took his stance.

<b>

"You can no longer hide in the shadows. Perish here, vampire!"

"That doesn't seem like something you can manage! Now that you've unleashed such magical power, I wonder if you can fight as you did before?"

<b>

Marina, having her chain repelled by the magical wall, turned back to Howard and glared at him.

<b>

Even though the knight order had increased their combat power, they still couldn't match us.

In reality, Joel, while protecting Electra, was still overwhelming the two knights with his serious offensive.

Indeed, the ones to be truly wary of were these individuals.

Although dawn was drawing near, which side was truly cornered? I will clarify that here.

<b>

"Gather! 'Bloodstained Chains'!!"

<b>

Marina gathered the many chains rippling around her and bundled them in her left and right hands.

Several chains intertwined and were bound together, forming a bundle that exceeded one meter in length.

Marina wielded it like a gigantic whip, striking down toward Howard with enough force to crush the air.

However, Howard easily dodged it as if he were merely taking a stroll, with the great sword still slung over his shoulder.

The avoided chain struck the ground, resonating with a heavy vibration and significantly carving the black rocky earth.

As it scraped the earth, the chain swayed again, closing in on Howard like a wall.

Additionally, another chain whip was swung down.

With a grinding sound, the two walls moved in to sandwich Howard.

Seeing the chains bend and close in on him, Marina coldly smirked.

<b>

However, just as the chains seemed ready to crush Howard, the mass of chains exploded like a bomb.

While Marina stared in astonishment, Howard sliced through the approaching chains one after another with his mighty sword.

The chain whip, which was supposed to possess overwhelming mass, was swiftly severed, scattering the chains in every direction.

As Howard continued to swing his sword without pause, his eyes glowed with a faint light as he locked onto Marina beyond the chains.

<b>

<b>

Joel had previously overwhelmed the two knights, but now he was struck and sent flying by Conrad's swinging battle axe.

Electra was pressing her wounds and using fire to support Joel, but she was being cornered by Gilbert's maneuvers, sustaining more injuries.

<b>

Marina bit her lip as she glanced around the battlefield.

<b>

This was bad; dawn would arrive in just a few minutes. There was no longer a time for hesitating or worrying about appearances.

<b>

Marina jumped back, distancing herself from Howard while gathering her magical power.

As she rubbed her hands together and raised them above her head, she concentrated her magical power into her palms.

In response to the accumulated magical power above her head, chains extended from both arms, condensing into a mass.

Furthermore, the severed and fragmented chains gathered, forming an even larger mass.

Before long, a gigantic sphere of chains, over 20 meters in diameter, began to take shape, clanking and rotating.

<b>

The chain sphere continued to grow larger.

Marina's face, squeezed to the limit of her magical power, bore no hint of ease.

<b>

"Huh?!"

<b>

At the presence of the concentrated magical power outside of her realm, Howard growled.

<b>

"Even if the walls cannot be breached from the outside or inside, damage can still be inflicted from within, right?"

<b>

Due to the excessive supply of magical power, Marina's capillaries burst, and blood dripped down.

<b>

"Joel! Electra! Get back!! I will pierce this land along with them!!!"

<b>

"I won’t let you!!"

<b>

Howard bent his body as if drawing a bow, pointing the tip of his sword toward the front, lowering his stance deeply.

The magic inscriptions on his equipment shone brightly.

Flames took the shape of light, running along his arms, flowing into the black great sword.

The magical power contained within the great sword shone blue, converging toward the tip.

<b>

"Destroy Blade!"

<b>

With a roar that shook the atmosphere, the blue flash unleashed a blow meant to annihilate the enemies before it.

The thunderous sound resonated around, illustrating the ferocity of the flash of light.

Swallowed by the blue light's impact, the gigantic sphere of chains, which was supposed to pierce the earth, was shredded into tiny pieces and disappeared.

<b>

"Ah... ah... gu...?! Gulp?!"

<b>

Caught in the blue shockwave, Marina was engulfed along with the chains.

As the waves of impact threatened to tear her limbs apart, the black great sword that had unleashed the shockwave further pierced Marina.

<b>

Marina was propelled backward into a large tree that had been standing nearby.

The tree, exposed to the violent shock, lost branches and leaves, bending and breaking in half, becoming like a massive stake driven into the ground.

Marina was impaled in the abdomen by the black great sword and slammed hard against the stake.

<b>

“Gah! Gyaaa!! Giiiaaaahhh!!!”

<b>

The "Grand Divider," deeply embedded in her abdomen, had driven Marina against the stake, its blade glowing with a blue phosphorescent light, radiating holy energy.

The part of the blade that penetrated Marina's abdomen hissed and emitted white smoke, continuing to burn with the holy energy.

Marina, continuously screaming in agony, had lost her arms below the elbows, and there was no sign of them repairing as they too emitted white smoke.

The bondage she wore was mostly torn apart, and it no longer served its purpose as armor.

<b>

Her once collected silver hair was now shredded and unruly, wildly flailing around as Marina thrashed about.

Her eyes were wide and dyed bright red, her mouth was split wide open, and her fangs were unnaturally long, embodying the visage of a vampire.

With tears of blood streaming down her cheeks and blood bubbling from her mouth, it dripped from her pale blue body, forming a pool of blood at her feet.

As she thrashed about trying to escape from the impaling stake, there was no way for her to free herself from the embedded "Grand Divider."

<b>

Howard further plunged the great sword deeper into her.

Marina screamed as if squeezing out her very insides, blood spraying from her mouth as she continued to wail.

<b>

Howard's back was facing a space where trees had fallen, allowing a view of distant mountain peaks.

Now, from the sunken valley, the sun was beginning to rise, illuminating the surrounding clouds, painting the dawn sky.

The sun showcased its radiance just before appearing, sending beams of light up into the sky from the mountain valley.

<b>

Carrying that light on his back, Howard gripped his great sword and spoke to the vampire, who was thrashing about trying to escape the sunlight.

<b>

“O you who seek eternity at the expense of the living! There is no way for those who refuse the dawn to attain tomorrow! From now on, let your body once again mark the passage of time!!”

<b>

Eventually, the rays of light descended into the valley, reaching the ground. Howard's back gleamed with the light.

Then, the light of dawn enveloped the vampire.

<b>

“Uuuuughh!! Gyaaaahhhhhh!!!”

<b>

Burned by the pure light, the vampire screamed in despair.

<b>

“Marina! Marina!!”

“Ugh, argh...!!”

<b>

Joel and Electra reached out towards the one being burned, but they recoiled from the sunlight that was approaching them as well.

Both of them were met with Conrad and Gilbert, who raised their weapons, declaring it was time to settle the score.

<b>

“This is the end. At the very least, I will finish this quickly for you.”

<b>

The two vampires, their eyes tinged red, looked up at Conrad while on their hands and knees.

<b>

“Be burned by the morning sun, and perish, vampire!!!”

<b>

The skin of the sunlit vampire began to bubble as if boiling.

Despite being scorched, the vampire thrashed desperately, attempting to escape, unleashing a shrill cry that split the earth as it continued to scream. Howard tightened his grip on the great sword to infuse it with even more holy energy to deliver the final blow.

<b>

At that moment――――――――――――――――

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Shadows covered the world.

<b>

<b>

In that moment, Howard felt every hair on his body stand on end, instinctively taking a defensive stance.

For an instant, he absorbed the shock with the "Grand Divider," which he had taken from the vampire, but was still blown backwards.

<b>

“Guh... n-no?!”

<b>

At the same time, Conrad's chest was slashed open horizontally, and Gilbert coughed blood from his back.

Conrad spat out blood and fell to the ground, shaking the earth as he did so.

<b>

“Hey, Marina. It’s been a while, and you’ve become quite the lovely lady! Hahaha!”

“...M-Master Halbert...”

<b>

The shadow spoke.

In its arms, a vampire, its entire body burned and charred, clung to the shadow.

<b>

The shadow swayed, blocking out the morning sun.

It stood on the edge of a crumbling silver wall, looking down at Howard and the others from above.

<b>

“Hah! Did you think dawn was a symbol of hope? Hahaha!!”

<b>

The man standing within the shadow denied the dawn.

The shadow surrounding him squirmed and expanded, engulfing those present.

<b>

Now, despair named Halbert East had descended upon that land.
