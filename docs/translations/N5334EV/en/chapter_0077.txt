# 72 Vampires at Dawn Part 2

Thank you very much for your patience.

I ended up with over 20,000 words;

<blank>

Some of the language may be very cruel.

If you are not a fan or feel uncomfortable, please do not hesitate to contact us.

"Well, I've managed to get around a little bit, haven't I?

Noooo, my fingertips are still twitching... ......

"It can't be helped, Mr. Nosoli, you are an old man, and you mustn't push yourself too hard.

What's the meaning of that kindly line with a wry smile in your eyes?

<blank>

The doctors are recovering too fast. I don't want to move yet.

"Well, you still don't seem very tense, even though you almost fell prey to a vampire.

"It's hard to imagine a human being with a life-threatening condition.

Well, that's what you do best.

"Well, I can't help it."

Oh, no.

"You teachers are so, so, so, so rude!"

<blank>

So, let's put all that nonsense aside, shall we?

"You don't give a shit how I'm treated?

It's not looking good for you, is it?

Yes, I heard that the Knights lost more than half of their batteries in the first raid. And now there are no healers left. Mr. Seiwashi, can't you do something about it?"

"Well, those batteries require a proper adapter, so trying to charge them directly would be inefficient, time-consuming, and not a good stopgap measure.

What an inflexible little thing you are."

I can heal a little, but I'm not a priest, so I can't heal you all. Above all, I don't have any magic power right now.

"Well, that's just plain useless."

Wookiee!"

<blank>

Some emerged from their hastily constructed trenches and made a commotion.

They are Drs. Seywasi Melchio, Morris Baltasar, and Nosoli Casbal, and Seywasi's assistant, Josrine Joslan.

<blank>

'Teachers! Please hurry back to the trenches! It's not safe here!

<blank>

Some of the knights noticed the four coming out of the trench and ran up to them.

<blank>

"Oops, ......, I believe you're in the ......3 group, or was it group leader of group 4?"

<blank>

Morris tapped his fingers on his forehead, searching for the knight's name in his memory.

<blank>

I'm Norman Lance, leader of Team 4. I'm Norman Lance, head of Team 4.

I'll be right with you! Yes, yes! You're the one with the spear guards!"

"Teachers, we don't care about that right now! Now is not the time to worry about that, but rather to evacuate quickly! The enemy is already here! Damn it! Damn you!

<blank>

At the same time as he announced his name, Norman Lance, with his back to the three doctors, sat down, activated "Boost Up," and drew his axe spear at the ready.

A dull metallic sound echoes in front of Norman, and the cadmos knight who came running straight at him is blown away, shield and all, by the axe spear.

<blank>

Immediately, Norman activated the magic in his boots with a "magic manifestation device.

<blank>

Air Ride"

It creates a layer of compressed wind between the sole and the ground surface and glides across the surface.

<blank>

Norman faced the flying cadmos knight, closed the gap at once, and with the momentum of the "Air Ride" activation, thrust his axe spear deeply into its chest.

And just like that, the blue flame emitted from the tip of the spear consumes the cadmos knight.

A rejected cartridge flew out of Norman's shoulder and flew through the air in a cloud of white smoke.

<blank>

Norman made sure that the cadmos knight perished and breathed on his shoulder, propping up the axe spear he held up, as he relaxed his shoulders.

<blank>

(Is this the wear and tear of killing one of them? ....... This is not good, these guys are definitely better than us. They're no match for the undead we've seen so far, and they're too much for us in a one-on-one fight! (This is no way to protect the teachers, ......)

<blank>

Norman pushed up his glasses, which were down a bit, and was painfully aware of the severity of the current situation as he breathed.

<blank>

"Yes, what is it? You look like a big man, don't you?"

"It can't be helped, they're better than us. You must have your hands full."

If you think so, please return to the trenches as soon as possible. If you come ...... with more than one person, you will not be able to ...... get through on your own."

<blank>

Norman readjusted his axe and spear, searched the area for signs of life, and urged the three doctors to take shelter.

<blank>

This is where we are now, in a defensive position created by the logistics unit.

<blank>

However, the camp, which had been built up like a fortress, had been severely damaged by the vampire attack earlier.

Most of the tents set up inside had burned down, leaving only their wreckage.

<blank>

In the center of the camp, a hole had been dug where the tent had been and a wall had been built around it to create a trench as a defense against magical attacks.

The wounded were housed in them and were also treated. The three doctors were supposed to have been evacuated into it.

However, Norman, who was in charge of escorting the doctors, noticed them coming outside before he knew it and rushed over to them.

<blank>

The battalion commanders are standing around on the front line, but the enemy has already entered the position.

What will happen if we allow any more enemies to invade. ......

Norman's gaze behind his glasses is filled with strength, and his hand grips the spear-axe as he stares ahead.

<blank>

Hmmm, but I guess we can't say that, can we?

<blank>

Seywash muttered as he squinted.

Norman felt his own hair stand on end at the sudden appearance of this presence.

<blank>

"Oh, no. You've been hiding here too, haven't you?"

<blank>

A woman in a black nightdress put the index finger of her right hand over her mouth and moved her hips as if she was making a supple motion, speaking to me happily.

The moment Norman saw the woman ...... Elektra, he put an azure glow on his spear axe, which he held up, and plunged into her in a straight line.

The assault, which combines "Boost Up" and "Air Ride," glides across the ground toward the target and thrusts the spear tip toward Elektra at the shortest possible distance.

<blank>

However, just as he thought he had thrust the tip of his spear, Elektra's body seemed to blur and scramble away from the spot.

Norman immediately reverses his body, drills his feet into the ground, brakes himself, and stops in place, hunched over, to search for signs of the area.

<blank>

Â "Well, you look very tasty too ......"

<blank>

From the back of his head, a sweet-smelling whisper clung to Norman's ear.

Norman hurriedly jumped back and slid his body between Elektra and the doctors to form a wall.

<blank>

"Oh, that's very healthy of you. That's good too, isn't it?"

<blank>

With a chilling sneer, he raises his right hand in front of his face, palm up in a fluttering motion. His right hand was then engulfed in flames.

When Elektra shakes her hand as if to remove it, the flame grows like a whip and strikes Norman.

<blank>

The whip of flame flexed and bit into Norman's side as if it had mass, cleaving his body.

Blown away, Norman was also engulfed in flames and rolled to the feet of the doctors, screaming.

<blank>

Norman is at the feet of the doctors, bushy white smoke coming from his armor and grunting in agony.

<blank>

'It's been a long time since I've had the pleasure of meeting you, Lord Elf. I hope you are enjoying yourself after this little boy. I know the Lord will enjoy the company of this young lady, so I will greet her graciously. I am very sorry to say goodbye to your grandfathers at ............. Unfortunately, it does not seem to be to our taste. Hohoho ......"

<blank>

Elektra narrowed her eyes and let her gaze wander over Norman, Seyvard, and Joseline, in that order, before glancing at Morris and Nosoli, placing her hand over her mouth and letting out a small sneer.

<blank>

"I'm sorry to hear you've been dumped, Mr. Nosoli."

"Mr. Morris, you do realize you're included, don't you?"

I know! I'm so happy for you, Mr. Eagle. I've got a big crush on you! You're a handsome man, and you've earned it!"

"Hmmm, this is a very annoying invitation indeed. I guess I have always refused such self-centered invitations!

"Oh, no! A handsome man says differently!"

<blank>

<blank>

Norman's barely moving hand reached for the activation switch on the medical kit attached to his waist.

The sound of high-pressure air is heard, and the magic of recovery is activated.

After using up all the magic power that had been filled, the empty cartridges were ejected from the device, and Norman finally got up from his body.

<blank>

(Damn! Just one hit consumes a whole cartridge to recover? The difference between them and us is too great!)

<blank>

Standing up, Norman, breathing on his shoulder, readjusted his spear axe and pointed the spear tip at Elektra.

Elektra smiled and looked at him admiringly.

<blank>

"You are protecting me, aren't you, my knight?

<blank>

Joseline, who had just positioned herself between Elektra and Joseline, clasped her hands behind her back as if moved, and shouted loudly.

<blank>

Huh?" Oh, ....... And, of course. It is my duty to protect you all."

<blank>

Norman says this is to be expected, although he is momentarily confused by the sudden voice behind him.

<blank>

"Oh, did you hear...did you hear...teachers...? After all, those who are watching are watching! I am a maiden protected by a knight!

<blank>

You're full of shit!"

I don't even know where to begin.

"Well, it is not hard to feel pain when I look at my disciple who has fallen ill.

"Whatever you want to say..! I am a winner! I'm a winner!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Norman lets out a short breath, sits back down, activates the "air ride" again, and darts toward Elektra, skidding along the ground.

Norman, holding his axe spear to his left, swung the tip of his spear, which was covered with azure holy air, with the momentum of his thrust toward Elektra.

Just as it seemed that the crescent-shaped axe section would catch Elektra with a burst of crushed air, Elektra's body shakes again and disappears from the scene.

This time, however, he immediately recaptured the sign.

Using the momentum from his axe and spear, he turns his body, corrects his trajectory, and takes a new aim with the tip of his spear.

<blank>

With a clang, the tip of the spear hit something and stopped moving.

Before she knew it, Elektra was standing in the darkness, her blood-colored claws outstretched like knives, catching Norman's axe-spear thrust. Electra's eyes opened again in admiration, and the smile around her mouth deepened.

<blank>

Gnashing his back teeth, Norman quickly pulled back the tip of his spear.

Polearm Rapid Attack"

A series of cartridges covered in white smoke are rejected from Norman's cupped hands.

At the same time, a barrage of axe and spear strikes were unleashed. The spearheads struck Elektra with such tremendous speed that they created afterimages.

<blank>

But Elektra, with her eyes narrowed and her head tilted back in amusement, was making light work of it with the five fingers of her right hand together and her long, blade-like red fingernails.

<blank>

Suddenly, Norman's thrusting stopped. On the spot, Norman spits out a mouthful of blood.

Before he knew it, the fingers of Elektra's left hand, standing close to Norman's, were thrusting into Norman's side.

The fingertip claws are as long as his right hand, penetrating the mobile armor like paper, and all five claws are deeply embedded in Norman's body.

<blank>

Elektra pulled her claws out of Norman's body with a yick, moving them as if she was licking them off.

Electra, gazing happily at Norman as he screamed, slid her red claws out of Norman's body.

Then he crawled his red tongue over his own long fingernails, which were covered with the Norman's blood, one by one.

As she licks her nails as if she is sucking them, Elektra's eyes become more and more moist.

<blank>

Norman, who had moved away from Elektra, supported himself with his axe spear and barely managed to hold on.

The five claws that pierced the body had also deeply damaged the internal organs further inside.

In extreme pain, Norman again activates the medical kit around his waist to treat the wound.

The treatment is completed immediately and the used-up cartridges are rejected, but they do not return to their exhausted strength.

<blank>

<blank>

The healing techniques used by the priesthood are, in the first place, a form of regeneration that reads the subject's etheric information and recreates the subject in his or her original state.

The results depend greatly on the skill of the user, but in any case, it is a high-level art that can only be used by those who serve the gods.

<blank>

On the other hand, there is also magic that can provide treatment among those handled by other magic users.

Many of these healing magics are designed to manipulate body fluids, activate cells, and greatly increase one's own healing power, so in most cases, they cannot restore lost strength or blood.

<blank>

Currently, the recovery magic contained in the "magic storage case" loaded in the medical patch that is standard equipment in the "heavy mobile magic armor" is the latter. Therefore, even if wounds can be healed, lost blood and physical strength cannot be restored.

<blank>

Right now, Norman's wounds are barely healed. Even if he were to proceed with further healing, he would not have the strength to do so.

It takes energy to heal wounds and to create blood. Now, with the awakening effect of recovery magic, he is barely able to stand on his feet.

Either way, the last of the recovery magic cartridges is the one you just used. There is no more left.

<blank>

But even so, we can't back down from this.

Norman readjusted his axe spear, his ready gaze blinking behind the lenses of his glasses, and pointed it, along with the spear point, at Elektra.

Elektra notices the look in Norman's eyes and giggles, letting out an exhale and narrowing her eyes.

<blank>

However, there was one who put his hand on Norman's shoulder and stepped forward, determined to do so.

<blank>

"Hmmm, you did well. I think you should get some rest."

Let's go, sir! This place is dangerous! Please leave quickly!

<blank>

Seywasi held Norman back and took a step forward.

<blank>

"Oh, no? You couldn't resist coming out, could you? Don't worry, we'll have you soon.

<blank>

Elektra happily says a few words to Seywash as she crawls her tongue under her own fingernails.

<blank>

The trees in Irosio are filled with a high concentration of magic. They should be quite resistant to flames emitted by magic. Considering the size and skill of the magical power that burns them away so easily without even chanting, they must have originally been wizards of considerable ability.

"............ what's wrong with that?"

<blank>

What does Elektra, whose expression has disappeared, have to do with Seywash's musings? She asked coldly, "What does that have to do with anything?

<blank>

I don't really care. I just thought that if you are going to use magic, it would be appropriate for me to be your partner.

I'm sure you've been to ....... You seem to have a lot to say about magic, don't you? Shall I play with you directly at ...... with my magic? It is a learning experience to know the edge of the abyss, isn't it?"

<blank>

"Well, let's get on with the lecture, shall we?"

<blank>

In response to Seywash's words, Elektra took out a leather sachet and scattered the fangs inside it around.

<blank>

First, let's have a little fun with these kids, shall we? Ho ho ho ......"

<blank>

Electra's mouth turns up at the corners as she spreads her hands out wide as if she is trying to wipe them away, and she sneers.

Then Morris stepped forward.

<blank>

"Well, Mr. Morris, can you go?"

Atabojay!"

<blank>

Morris folded the edge of the shovel-like "earth-mover" in his hand into a hoe-like shape, and swung it down and stabbed it into the earth.

Then a crack ran from the point of penetration to the place where the fangs were spread, and the place caved in one after another.

<blank>

Electra sees this, raises her eyebrows suspiciously, and stops moving.

<blank>

You seem to be wondering. The magic is a summoning magic that uses the dragon's fangs as a catalyst to summon magic from the earth's veins to be activated by the magician. The magician uses only a small amount of magic power to activate it, making it a very economical magic.

That's where this "Earth Awakening" comes in! It can also manipulate the flow of magic in the earth. Too bad! Now the magic around the catalyst is karakketsu! Ha ha ha ha!

The magic of the earth's veins is useless without the magic of the magician's veins, since there is no burden of magic on the magician.

<blank>

Elektra narrows her eyes and looks coldly at Seywash.

<blank>

I'm sure you can come to that. ....... But you don't think you've sealed my hand with that, do you?

<blank>

As she said this, Electra began to spin the flame in her lightly raised right hand.

<blank>

"Well, of course," he said, "but I wouldn't recommend wasteful behavior. But I wouldn't recommend wasting your time.

Hush now!

<blank>

As soon as Elektra shouted this, he shook off his hand vigorously and threw the flame in his palm.

The flames become a flaming bullet, which is directed at the seiwaashi at high speed with a booming sound.

<blank>

However, before the flaming bullet could make contact with the seiwaashi, it shone brightly in the air, and then disappeared as if it had burned up.

When Elektra sees this, her eyes widen.

<blank>

"Hmmm, the magic concentration camp can be used in this way as well."

<blank>

At the foot of the sardine, a thin, brass-colored stick-like object surrounded the trench and was long enough to sever the distance between it and Elektra.

<blank>

"This is ......, when did this ...... happen?"

<blank>

Norman pushed his glasses up with his right hand as he leaned his weight on the axe spear that stood to his left, staring at the shimmering brass-colored line at the Seiwaashi's feet and muttering in surprise.

<blank>

"Hmmm, thanks to your spearman's attention, I guess."

<blank>

Saying this, Seywash tossed several adjuster cases in his hands.

The empty case rolls straight to the ground.

<blank>

The "magic concentration zone" is now taking in Irosio's enormous amount of magic power and at the same time, it is also blowing up the concentrated magic power on this spot. This has created a magical barrier that is so strong that even half-hearted magic will be unable to overcome it. I don't mean to say this, but I think this is quite powerful.

<blank>

I don't think you can pull it off with half a magic trick," says Seywash.

Hearing this, Elektra wrinkled her brow and squinted her eyes in abhorrence.

<blank>

"Are you ...... left ......? If so, why don't you stroke him directly?"

<blank>

Elektra said, extending the red fingernail of her fifth finger to the length of a small knife at once and taking a lick of the nail of her index finger, she looked at Seiwaashi with narrowed eyes.

The figure disappears from the place as if dissolving in the darkness.

However, almost as soon as Elektra disappeared, the sound of something exploding echoed through the air.

<blank>

Ack?

<blank>

There was Elektra, who let out a small scream and fell backward as if something had knocked her off her feet.

<blank>

"...... what? ...... what the hell have you done?

<blank>

Elektra raised her eyebrows and looked at Seywash sharply, as if in alarm, and then questioned him hoarsely, holding his right hand down.

The fingertips of his right hand were smoking white smoke as if he had been burned.

<blank>

I don't recommend that you carelessly disembodied and enter the place," he said. As I said before. As I said before, there is a burst of converged magical energy in the area right now. It's a combination technique with the "earth awakening," which can manipulate the earth's veins. It is a combination technique with the "earth raising" that can manipulate the veins of the earth. That is the same as exposing the flow of the earth's veins, so to speak.

<blank>

Seywash and Morris grinned and clenched their fists against each other in a trickle, the corners of their mouths lifting.

Elektra gave it a silent, cold stare.

<blank>

Astral beings like yourselves cannot cross this current. If you force yourselves into the flow, your manas will be trapped in the torrent of the earth's veins and will dissipate to the end of causality without returning to the three realms. If it is disembodied, it is even more so. Well, if you want to try it, I say be my guest.

".................."

<blank>

Elektra silently listened to Seywasi's words and looked around the area where the barrier was put up without caution.

<blank>

"...... And then what? What are you going to do after that? It seems to me that you have already reached an impasse.

<blank>

Electra, who had returned her eyes to Seywash, said this with a funny giggle as she narrowed her eyes and put her hand over her mouth.

<blank>

"This is how it's done!"

<blank>

In Nosoli's palm was a small torch-like object that blew sparks.

In front of his eyes, he wears black, light-shielding glasses.

Furthermore, I noticed that everyone in the room was wearing dark glasses as well.

<blank>

As soon as Elektra's eyes widened in surprise, Nosoli threw the torch in his hand toward the ground with all his might.

The torch bursts into flames with a bash sound, enveloping the entire area in an intense flash of light.

<blank>

I'm sorry! What is it? What is this? ...... Kooooooooooooooo!!!"

<blank>

Elektra guards her face with her arms to avoid the light that takes away her vision, but the intense flashes of light seem to pierce even that, filling Elektra's world with white.

By the time Elektra's vision returned, those who should have been there had already disappeared.

<blank>

"............, what a surprise, ......."

<blank>

Electra squints and blinks as if to check her eyesight, and looks around the area, but there is already no sign of anything in the vicinity.

<blank>

"Hmm, you mean in there. ......"

<blank>

Electra muttered as if looking through the wall of the trench.

Electra puts her hands on her hips and exhales deeply and quietly, letting out a sigh as her shoulders drop from their cowering position.

<blank>

I can't help it. ...... I was originally going to surround you so that you would not run away. ...... Well, good, go hide for now. This is such an absurd barrier, it won't last until the sun rises anyway, will it? There is no escape anyway. ......

<blank>

Elektra narrowed her eyes and stroked her mouth with her finger. Her fingertips, which should have been burnt, had already returned to their beautiful white shape.

Then he snaps his fingers next to his face.

Then, small flames lit up on both sides of the ground where Electra stood.

<blank>

The flames, which flicker and dance, are as large as a man's fist and powerfully illuminate Electra's feet.

As if conducting a band, she gracefully fluttered her hands out, and flames were created and spread around Elektra one after another.

Soon, the shimmering lights were surrounding the trench and shook powerfully, as if they did not want anything to be missed.

<blank>

Elektra gazes at the flames with satisfaction, then brings her white fingers up to her mouth again, where she runs her red tongue over them.

<blank>

"...... the next time I see you, I'm going to squeeze everything out of you, okay? Looking forward to it?"

<blank>

And Elektra laughed aloud.

Soon, its body blurred as it disappeared into the darkness of the forest, and only the echoes of its laugh echoed through the darkness of the trees.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm, something gives me the chills."

"Ahhh, that's...I know...somehow...that...that...is...definitely...a rabukkoru. "Oh, that's... that's... that's... that's... that's... that's... that's... definitely... a love corral.

<blank>

Seywash hugged his shoulder and shook himself with a burr.

<blank>

"Oh no, that was a close one."

Yes, indeed, it was a close call.

"Well, I'm glad they let you off the hook for now."

<blank>

Sitting in the trenches, the three doctors breathed a sigh of relief.

However, when Norman heard this, he took off the light-shielding glasses he had been made to wear, and while adjusting his own glasses, which had shifted, he shouted out in surprise.

<blank>

What are you talking about? It was the teachers who dominated him from start to finish!"

<blank>

Hearing this, Morris replied with a sigh.

<blank>

No, that was just in the nick of time. What do you say, Mr. Seywash?"

If they had used the "Great Flame Stream" that was shot at us a little while ago, the barrier would have been removed without a doubt. If they had used that, we would have had no choice but to be extinguished. It's a good thing they wanted to capture us.

The fangs that were scattered would have been useless if they had been scattered away from the area of effect of the "earth waker"!

Hm, and the barrier would have been good for another 10 minutes," he said. Either way, it was a dead end.

"Oh, no. ......"

<blank>

The last one I used, the 'Reishin Flash Bullet,' worked somehow! I brought it to blind the demonic beasts. I brought it as a distraction for demonic beasts, but it seems to work well for astral demons too! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

<blank>

But it worked because it caught me off guard," Nosoli said, laughing.

<blank>

Well, either way, I think it's best to do what you can now. Come here, Joseline, because this is a job for you.

"Yes? I'm facing... work...?"

"Well, Mr. Spear, will you lie down here?"

"Who is it? Yourself?"

I think your wound is only closed, but it is far from healed. You can barely stand up, can you?

"...... is, no, ...... is, yes, indeed it is. And, but ......!"

'Hmmm, just go ahead and lie down with your tots. And you, Joseline. It's your knight, isn't it? I think it would be best if you treated it yourself."

What? Sensei, I have been saying for a while now that I have no magic power..."

Hmmm, that's why I got you this."

<blank>

What is this? What is this? Why are you putting on the bracelet? Moreover, this bracelet has a chain attached to it! This makes me look like a captured person!

It's just a small chain. It's not worth fussing over."

The chain is connected to the "magic concentration circle. The chain is connected to a "magic concentration zone," which supplies the magic power according to your magic power, so you can concentrate on your recovery work as much as you want. There are a lot of injured people here, so I hope you can get on with it.

Huh? Eh? Wait, wait, please! By any chance... am I... stuck... here...?

I'm not going to rest until there are no more people injured enough to move. I should think there would be no time to rest, at least until there are no more people injured to the point of immobility."

Hi! Huheeeeeeeee? There are more than 20 people who have been seriously injured, aren't there?

There is no one left in the priesthood who specializes in this field. There's a limit to how much magic the magicians can do, isn't there? The number of medical patches is also limited! You have no choice but to do your best, my assistant!

<blank>

Oh, no! I haven't slept for a long time! I've been up all night...? Does that mean you can't rest at all?

It's like that! It's the same for everyone here! If you think you're the only one who can rest, you're wrong!

The three of us are stuck here because we are adjusting the flow of magic in the "magic concentration zone" to Joseline's magical quality. You will continue to recover there.

In general, the magic to restore physical strength in order to improve healing power consumes more magic power than it is effective, and is not very user-friendly!

That's why we supply the magic power! The assistant can use all the magic he wants and do his job until he collapses!"

I don't have time to play with you, my assistant!

"Well, I'm going to need you to work hard."

"Oh, teachers...you're such bastards!"

<blank>

A brass-colored chain of lights illuminated the area in the dimly lit trench.

Joseline's plaintive cries only echoed through the air.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Kuhi, kuhi! Kihihi, yihi! Haa! Aahi!

<blank>

A blade flashes through the darkness of the forest.

The machete-like slash of the great sword, delivered in rapid succession, one flash, then two, then three, is sharp and heavy.

Kyle Irvine, however, was able to overcome this challenge by using his nightsword, which was covered with blue sanctuary, to hit them one after another.

<blank>

And a single blue sword flash that Kyle draws in the darkness.

The brown woman who avoids it jumps back.

But blood splashed vigorously from the wound on his brown flank.

The brown skin was covered with scratches and blood dripped from every part of the body.

<blank>

The brown woman ...... Joel's face was upturned, and from time to time a lustrous exhalation escaped from her mouth, while her moist eyes fixed feverishly on Kyle, who was at the point of the sword she was holding.

Kyle keeps his sword at the right side of his face and takes a stance with the tip of the sword pointed at Joel.

Without pause, Joel stepped in at a speed that could not be caught by an ordinary person.

Kyle flicked Joel's sharply drawn great sword with the belly of his nightsword and sliced through Joel's ample bosom with the tip of his cut.

Joel screams in pleasure as blood sprays out of his mouth. Immediately afterwards, however, Joel's figure vanishes as if in a blur.

At the same time, Kyle's figure blurs and disappears, and the next moment, blood sprays on the spot.

<blank>

Aaghii!

<blank>

Joel screamed and appeared with his body turned up, his back slashed wide at an angle.

On his back, Kyle stood in the form of a slashed up nightsword.

Kyle immediately regains his stance, but the look on his face is grim as he breathes on his shoulder.

<blank>

Oh, ahi, khi, khi! I like ......, I like it! You're pretty good, too! Hihi! Let's ...... do more!

As far as I'm concerned, ......, I'd like to get this over with."

<blank>

Joel's lewd-sounding laughter echoed through the trees as the sound of swords striking the wind echoed through the air.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A huge black shadow looms just beside it.

Howard cut it off with a full swing of his great black sword.

The skull of a huge black ancient dragon, longer than a man's height, was bounced sideways with great force. Then Howard shouted backward.

<blank>

Conrad! He's gone!"

"Oh, man! I'm running out of time for this, you big bastard!"

<blank>

Conrad ducked under the flank of one of the undead that had been flung away, parried the charge of the other one that was coming forward with his battle-axe, and spat the words abhorrently.

<blank>

Damn it!"

<blank>

Tony Easton just barely avoided the long tail of undead that loomed like an even blacker wall.

At the same time, the kite shield caught the large and small stones and debris that its tail bounced off. However, it was almost blown away by the momentum of the kite, but it barely managed to hold on.

He quickly regains his position and prepares for the next attack.

<blank>

The attack has been going on for more than an hour now.

The opponent is just too tough.

If we could break even one of their corners with a big blow, it would be enough to reverse the current war situation, but even though they are not willing to give up, I am getting fed up with the way they repair themselves as soon as they get a few scratches.

Tony and Kyle may be getting to the end of their rope, Howard thinks as he looks at them.

<blank>

"Master, it is that chain, after all. The miasma is being sent through that chain."

"Well, I guess that's about it."

"Go on! You're playing a very small hand!"

<blank>

On the other side of the large undead, a woman in chains was wearing a thin smile.

The chain-wearing woman ...... Marina let the chains she wears sway around her body as if she were swaying in feathers.

Furthermore, some of the chains extending from the marina are also connected to the giant undead.

<blank>

It seems she is sucking up the miasma from deep within the earth and sending it through the chains to the bones.

<blank>

Gilbert shined the magic seal on his eyepatch and told Howard about the flow of magic he had captured, as if to say that he had finally seen it.

<blank>

<blank>

Now Howard and his group were completely separated from the main body of the Order.

Around them, three giant undead "Dark Scaled Danasaur" surrounded them, keeping a certain distance between them as if to check them.

If Howard and his team tried to avoid them, they would turn to them, and if they tried to attack, the three of them would work together to catch and avoid them.

The timing of the game was exquisitely misaligned, and I was having a very difficult and frustrating time.

<blank>

In other words, the same as the undead who attacked us in the first place.

They are just trying to sew Howard and the others into this place.

Marina, who had not moved from behind the huge black undead, looked quietly at Howard and the others with a thin smile on her mouth.

<blank>

"What's the matter, Howard, out of breath?"

"Get out of my face, you fool! You're the one who's lost your footing!"

I'm just storing up a little power! I'm just saving up a little bit of energy! Who do you think you are?

I'll decide soon, then! Then it's time to decide, alright?

Oh, yeah!

<blank>

Howard's class, "Warlord," raises the morale and combat power of the entire unit just by being there.

Conrad, a former class of "Herculean Lords," though retired from active service, was similarly more aggressive than usual for the knighthood he is in.

The fact that the Knights were able to fight so well against the undead hordes was largely due to their presence.

<blank>

And Howard and his team were now about to use one of their own unique skills.

The magic of Howard and Conrad is kneaded inside it, increasing in density.

<blank>

<blank>

But then, with a loud boom, a flaming bullet approaches.

Tony Easton caught it with his kite shield, which he quickly set up.

The flaming bullets shot one after the other impacted Tony through his shield like a barrage of huge hammers.

Tony bit his back teeth and let out a small moan as he held on, but was finally engulfed by the force of the flaming bullet and blown away.

Tony's body, engulfed in flames, slams against the rock face, thrashing.

<blank>

Gah!"

TONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<blank>

Kyle turns around and yells at Tony.

Tony was rolling on the earth, bushy and white smoke, and eventually began to yuk up his body.

Kyle confirms this and breathes a sigh of relief.

<blank>

Where are you coming from? Where did you come from?

<blank>

Kyle kept Joel in check as he searched the area, keeping his eyes peeled. Then, a woman in a black nightdress emerges from the darkness.

The woman ...... Elektra kept her right hand outstretched, which had been struck by a flaming bullet, and her tongue crawled over her left hand, which was covered in blood up to the wrist.

<blank>

"......! That, that blood?!!!!"

<blank>

Kyle peels his eyes when he notices the blood smeared on Elektra's hands.

Elektra narrowed her eyes and cowered her shoulders in a grand gesture toward Kyle.

<blank>

......Kokono!"

<blank>

Elektra, smiling at Kyle, who was glaring at her, dropped her right hand, which was pointing forward, and turned to Joel, who was nearby, and said a few words.

<blank>

"Oh? Joel, that gentleman has been on my radar, hasn't he?"

I'm not sure how to do this! This one's pretty responsive and fun, too, huh?"

"Is it not that one you want? Leave this one to me."

"Huh? That's not true, Elektra! I was the first one to play with you. It's not fair to take over! Let me play more!

<blank>

Electra sighed heavily as Joel raised his eyebrows and looked like a child who had just had a toy taken away from him.

<blank>

I found it at ....... I'm sorry Joel. This man is yours to do with as you please."

Is that okay? Yes! Hee hee hee."

Instead, ............."

<blank>

Electra then goes behind Joel.

<blank>

"...... will you make this up to me later?"

<blank>

Elektra went on, running her fingers along the open wound on Joel's back.

Joel arched his back, screamed loudly, and his body shook.

Then he looked back over his shoulder at Elektra and gave a small nod with moist eyes.

Elektra's eyes narrowed in satisfaction at the sight, and she lovingly stroked Joel's cheek with her long fingers before disappearing into the darkness.

<blank>

As soon as Elektra disappeared, Joel immediately pulled the great sword to his mouth and licked up its blade, the corners of his mouth lifting. And then .......

<blank>

"...... Heh, come on! Let's have some more fun!"

<blank>

With that, he turned to Kyle, raised his great sword and headed toward him.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

A flaming bullet that arose from the darkness struck Howard's back as he popped the huge black dragon's skull with "Grand Divider".

Howard dodged a flaming bullet that approached him at high speed one after another without looking back.

The dodged fireball hit a huge undead black bone that had been hit in the jaw and blew away its heavy body.

<blank>

With light in his gray eyes, Howard turns and cuts off the last of the approaching flaming bullets, and after the flaming magic fizzles out, he cuts through the darkness behind it with the returning blade.

With a clattering sound, Howard's slash was caught by five red knife-like claws.

<blank>

"......ck!"

<blank>

The woman in the black nightdress that arose from the darkness,...... Electra grunted in pain and jumped backward.

Howard steps into it with one foot and thrusts another follow-up blow.

The powerful sword blow, clothed in concentrated magic and distorting even the surrounding atmosphere, not only repelled the red claw that was about to catch it, but also shattered it into pieces.

Electra, who had been thrown off her body, still stuck out her left arm and pointed her five fingers at Howard, extending her red claws in place of her shattered right claw.

A red claw like a spear, extending at high speed, grazes Howard and thrusts him into the black earth.

Howard's grazed leather armor was smoking white as if it had been burned.

The red claws, which stuck out of the ground, emitted a vermilion light like iron in a blast furnace, and scorched the ground with high heat.

<blank>

Electra's mouth corners up in a grin as she shows Howard that the redness of her fingernails is the flame itself.

<blank>

Elektra pulls back and thrusts her left claw at high speed toward Howard again.

Four of the five fingers were extended to burn each of Howard's limbs.

The last one, still with a gray light, was aimed at the eye staring at me, and I reached out and let it fly, hoping to crush it.

<blank>

However, Howard grabbed the ricasso part of the sword, spun the large sword as if it were a baton, and flicked it away.

The momentum of the great sword, which was turned with a force that tore apart the atmosphere, shattered all the red claws and sent them flying apart.

The last one was crushed by Howard's back left fist as he swung away.

<blank>

Electra's eyes widened and she looked frightened as she was pushed by her own claws, which were crushed and torn apart, and by the force of the atmosphere, which was closing on her like a whirlpool.

But by then, Howard had already disappeared from Elektra's sight.

Elektra caught Howard's presence behind her and felt a strong shock to her body at about the same time.

<blank>

Aggi!!!!"

<blank>

Howard slid behind Elektra and, with the momentum of his revolving great sword, grabbed the tip of the sword and swung it around, striking her in the side of the head with the crossbar as if he were hitting her with a hammer.

<blank>

Blown away, Elektra punctures the earth with her limbs and immediately repositions herself.

The side of the body that took the blow was smoking and the damage done was not going to be undone immediately.

Electra's brow furrows as she puts her hand over her wound, and she sweats profusely with a stern expression on her face.

Elektra understood, having been hit directly by Howard. She understood the magnitude and density of Howard's magical power.

<blank>

He is not good. He has the power to destroy us if we meet him head on.

Things are fundamentally different from the knights I have been playing with.

<blank>

Elektra raised her body without caution and glared at Howard.

<blank>

But they are only human after all.

If they continue to attack day and night as originally planned, they will eventually wear out.

We just need to finish them off where they are weak.

This is an opponent with this much power. To eat them all up will be a great source of sustenance for us.

<blank>

Thinking all the way there, Elektra shook her standing body yulally and the corners of her mouth hung wide.

<blank>

It's wonderful to have a gentleman of such power. ......

"............"

"What do you say? Would you like to enjoy the greatest pleasures of this world at the end of your life?"

<blank>

Elektra opened her large V-shaped bosom, exposing the raised tips of her tassels, which were about to spill out, swinging widely.

She thrusts her hips out further, peeking her open legs through the slit in her dress, which is cut deeply near the waist, to show the white half of her body to Howard.

<blank>

Elektra opened her slit further and flushed her glazed eyes invitingly at Howard, tracing her bare thighs provocatively with her fingertips.

<blank>

Have you ever met this many women? Come and visit us at ....... Taste the best of women. All the pleasures of this world are here. Melt ...... inside me and I will ...... give it to you.

<blank>

Staring at Howard with moistened upper eyes, Electra spread her slit further and inserted a finger deep into the base of her leg, making a wet sound.

<blank>

Howard, however, keeps his poised sword tip pointed at Elektra, quietly overflowing with fighting spirit.

Then, as it was, he muttered a few words.

<blank>

I'm afraid I've never met a better woman than ...... Sonia!"

<blank>

Electra's eyes widened at Howard's rejection.

He responded to Howard's fighting spirit, which spread as it was, and took a step backward.

<blank>

Electra immediately relaxes her shoulders and shakes her head slowly with a sigh, as if to say it's a shame.

<blank>

I'm sorry to hear that. ...... But I think it's best if we take a short pause now. ...... I will see you later. ......

<blank>

With that said, his body dissolves into the darkness with an expression that does not erase his inferiority complex.

Elektra had turned into a black mist from the edges of her body and was about to disappear into the forest.

<blank>

It's warm! Vampire!"

<blank>

Howard shined the magic seal engraved on his equipment, stepped toward the black fog, and swung down a blue-lighted "Grand Divider" blow.

<blank>

Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

Electra sprawled on the spot with a scream as if squeezed out from inside her body.

Its shoulder had been cut wide open, and the right arm side was nearly severed from the body.

The nightdress is also ripped, spilling her ample bosom, and Elektra continues to scream as she spits blood.

<blank>

Elektra?

<blank>

Joel, who had been slashing with Kyle, opened his eyes and shouted at Elektra's unusual behavior.

<blank>

"Sir Cloud, ......, did you slay a non-embodied opponent?!"

<blank>

Kyle's out-of-the-box feat of slaying Howard's black mist opponent was a sight to behold.

<blank>

Joel! Take Elektra and back away!"

<blank>

A woman in chains ...... Marina shouted at Joel from behind a large black undead.

<blank>

Marina also noticed.

Howard, Conrad and Gilbert to the power.

<blank>

We knew they were capable of great things.

I had taken on the role of separating them from the Knights and checking them, but the closer I looked at them, the more their out-of-bounds power chilled me to the core.

However, no matter how much power you have, you cannot fully display all of your abilities if you are shackled.

The plan was to surround the weak in the rear so that they could not escape and take their yoke upon them.

Sooner or later, they will not be able to escape or show their ability, and they will be worn out.

<blank>

All that remains is to easily overrun it.

<blank>

So there is no need to go head-to-head, just pull back for now.

<blank>

Morning will soon come. The night is almost over! Let's pull out for a moment."

<blank>

Yes, just pull it at the crack of dawn.

Then we can go right back and continue the war of attrition.

<blank>

Just as Marina gave the order to pull up with a cold smile on her face, Howard thrust his great black sword, "Grand Divider," into the earth and shouted.

<blank>

Don't think you can get away with this forever, vampire!

You keep chocking up to me, slyly and spicy!"

<blank>

Conrad also barked up a storm, not hiding his irritation.

<blank>

But that's the end of it! From now on, you will never leave this land!

I don't think there's anything you can do about that, ......?"

<blank>

At Howard's words, Marina raises her eyebrows in displeasure and tells him that he cannot interfere with their activities.

Instead of responding, however, Howard put more force into his hand, which held the "Grand Divider" propped up against the ground.

<blank>

From now on, this land shall be my territory! Open up the land! Grand Divider! "The land of the sovereigns!"

<blank>

As if in response to Howard's shout, the magic seal engraved on the "Grand Divider" shines brighter.

The brilliance of the great sword thrust into the earth spread across the land with Howard at its center.

It expands to a radius of more than 100 meters, filling the area with the vast amount of magical power that Howard had been concocting.

<blank>

At the same time, power is poured into those who are within its range.

Kyle feels the overflowing power and swings his sword.

The sword flashed ever sharper, and I was amazed at the sharpness of my own sword.

<blank>

Tony gets up and takes a blow from a large undead that was approaching him head-on, and is surprised to find that there is almost no damage.

<blank>

Norman emerged from the trench, and with a swing of his spear-axe, filled with holy chi, he broke the magical fire that surrounded him.

<blank>

Cedric Meyer breaks the approaching cadmos knight with a single sword.

<blank>

Cornel Wallich plays several cadmosites by himself.

<blank>

Now, within the "territory" that Howard has opened up, the knights have greatly improved their fighting ability.

<blank>

With this! Stay crushed! 'Extreme citadel'!"

<blank>

Conrad, as if to make a no-holds-barred move, brings his huge battle axe down to the earth and unleashes his skills.

The magic power released from the battle-axe that was brought down spread out, creating ripples in the earth, and gave birth to a huge wall formed by magic power around them.

The ramparts that were created crushed the three giant undead at once and surrounded them thickly.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard uses the power of the "Grand Divider" to create a temporary territory and build the Conrad Wall on top of it. It creates a solid wall in a limited area.

It is a solid barrier that prevents enemies from attacking from the outside and never lets those inside escape. It was an absolute barrier created in a limited space for a short time.

<blank>

<blank>

Now you can't escape! You can't escape!

<blank>

Conrad, having exerted all the magic he had worked out, exhaled heavily.

<blank>

"You do not like the light of day and always hide in the shadows.

<blank>

They are like vermin, so to speak," Howard says.

Marina raises her eyebrows deeply at his words and glares at Howard.

<blank>

The higher beings are not afraid to go out in the sun, even in the daytime, but only the light of dawn will truly destroy you. But only the light of dawn will truly destroy you.

<blank>

Howard pulls out his "Grand Divider," which he thrust into the ground, and takes a stance.

<blank>

No longer will you be able to hide in the shadows. Perish here, vampire!"

I'm not sure how we'll be able to fight them now that they've unleashed so much magic! How can we fight as before now that you've unleashed so much magic?"

<blank>

Marina, whose chain that she had extended to pierce the barrier was bounced off the magical wall, turned back to Howard once again and glared into his face.

<blank>

Although the Knights have improved their combat power, they are still not as good as us.

In fact, Joel, who is seriously on the offensive while protecting Elektra, is still overwhelmed against the two knights.

After all, it is these people who should truly be alarmed.

There are not many more hours until dawn, but which of us is really trapped? Let me make it clear here.

<blank>

"Gather round! The Bloody Chain!

<blank>

The marina collects several chains that wave in the vicinity, and each chain is gathered together by the left and right hands.

The bundle of chains, which is more than a meter long, is made up of more than a dozen strands of rope.

Marina maneuvered it like a giant whip and brought it down on Howard with a force that crushed the atmosphere.

Howard, however, easily avoided this problem, carrying a large sword on his shoulder, as if he were taking a stroll.

The avoided chain strikes the earth, sending heavy vibrations echoing around the area and heavily chipping away at the black rocky earth.

The chains flexed again like a wall as Howard dodged to the side, cutting into the ground.

Furthermore, another whip of chains was struck down.

The two walls are closing in on Howard as if they were sandwiched between each other, scraping away at the rocks.

Marina chuckled coldly as she saw the chain whip flexing and closing in around Howard.

<blank>

But just when it looked like the chains were going to crush Howard, a chunk of the chain exploded like an explosion.

As Marina stares wide-eyed in astonishment, Howard uses his mighty sword to break off the oncoming chains one after another.

The whip of the chain, which should have had overwhelming mass, was shredded at first glance, and the chain was scattered into pieces.

Howard's eyes, which were constantly swinging his sword, were lit up with a pale light, and he was looking at Marina from behind the chains.

<blank>

<blank>

Joel, who had just overwhelmed the two knights, was now struck down by a battle-axe wielded by Conrad.

Elektra pressed her wounds and used her flames to cover Joel, but she was cornered by Gilberto's standoff and went on to inflict even more wounds.

<blank>

Marina took one look at the battlefield and bit her lip.

<blank>

The sun will be up in a few minutes. It's no time to be coy or pretentious.

<blank>

Marina leapt backward, distancing herself from Howard and kneading her magic on the spot.

He raises his hands above his head, rubbing them together, and concentrates the magic into his palms.

The chains extending from both arms are condensed and clumped together, as if in response to the converged magical power, further above the hands above the head.

Furthermore, the chains that have been shredded and broken into pieces are also gathered together, and the mass becomes larger and larger.

Soon there was a huge sphere of chains more than 20 meters in diameter, spinning with the chains making a gurgling sound.

<blank>

The sphere of the chain continues to grow in size.

Marina's face, which is a reflection of her having squeezed her magical power to the utmost limit, shows not the slightest sign of complacency.

<blank>

Nuh?

<blank>

Howard roars at the hint of magic condensed outside of its bounds.

<blank>

Even if the wall can't be penetrated from the outside or the inside, the damage can still be done from this inside to the inside, right?"

<blank>

The excessive supply of magical power causes the capillaries in Marina's arms to break and drip blood.

<blank>

Joel! Elektra! Avoid them! They will all perforate the land!

<blank>

I won't let you!

<blank>

Howard bends his body like an archer, points the tip of his sword held next to his face in front of him, and sits down deeply.

The magic seal on the equipment shines brightly.

One or two beams of light run down the flame-shaped shoulder strap, through the arm, and flow into the black great sword.

The magic power in the great sword becomes a blue glow and is converged toward the tip of the sword.

<blank>

Destroy Brit."

<blank>

Shaking the atmosphere, the blue flash strikes a blow that destroys the enemy before its face.

The roar that shook the area and echoed through the air told of the severity of the flash.

The huge sphere of chains, which was supposed to pierce the earth, was swallowed by the shock of the blue light, and disappeared in shreds.

<blank>

"Ah ......, ah ............ gi......ii! Gup?

<blank>

The shock of the ao swallows Marina along with the chain.

The black great sword that released the shock further pierced Marina as she was tossed around by a wave of shock that shredded her limbs.

<blank>

The marina was carried straight up to a large tree that was behind it.

The great tree had been subjected to a devastating impact, its branches and leaves snapped off and snapped in half, resembling a giant stake standing tall against the earth.

Marina was poked in the abdomen by a large black sword, which struck her vigorously on the stake.

<blank>

Gee! Geeaaaah! Geeaaaahhhhh!!!!"

<blank>

The "Grand Divider," which was thrust deeply into the abdomen and driven into the stake with the entire marina, was radiating holy air with the blade emitting a blue phosphorescence.

The abdomen of the marina, into which the blade bites, continues to sizzle with white smoke and burn with holy qi.

Marina's arms, which she screams incessantly, are missing from the elbows onward, still smoking white smoke and showing no sign of repair.

Most of the bondage they were wearing had been ripped off and no longer served as equipment.

<blank>

The silver-white hair, which had been held together, was shredded and unraveled, and the head of Marina, who was swinging wildly, was disheveled in an inverted manner.

His eyes are bright red and wide open, his mouth is wide open, his fangs are viciously long, and he looks exactly like a vampire.

He was crying tears of blood, spilling blood like foam from his mouth as well, and blood was dripping all over his pale blue body, creating a pool of blood at his feet in a blotch.

He flails his arms and legs in an attempt to break free from the stakes to which he is sewn, but he is never freed from the "grand divider" that has been attached to him.

<blank>

Howard stabbed his greatsword even deeper.

The vampire screamed a squeezing scream, blood spraying out of his mouth and flying.

<blank>

Behind Howard, he could see the distant peaks of the mountains beyond the space where the trees had fallen and become sparse.

The sun is now rising over the hollowed valley, illuminating the surrounding clouds and spreading a dawn-colored sky.

The sun showed its brilliance just before its appearance, extending a pillar of light from the valley of the mountain range toward the sky.

<blank>

Howard, with his light on his back, grips his great sword and tells the rampaging vampire to flee the sunlight.

<blank>

O you who seek to gain eternity by sacrificing the living! He who refuses the rising of the sun, how can he gain tomorrow? From now on, let the time tick by in your body again!

<blank>

Soon, a glowing light circled the mountain valley and descended to the surface. Howard's back shines in the light.

And the light of the rising sun envelops the vampire.

<blank>

Aaagiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!"

<blank>

Burned by the purifying light, the vampire squeezes out a cry of despair.

<blank>

Ma, Marina! Marina!

Oh, shit. ......!

<blank>

Joel and Elektra try to reach out to those being burned, but they are forced to back away by the sunlight that is closing in on them.

Even for those two, Conrad and Gilbert raise their weapons when it's time to settle the score.

<blank>

"It's over. At least I'll get it over with.

<blank>

Two vampires looked up at Conrad with their reddened eyes wide open and their hands on the ground.

<blank>

Burn in the morning sun and perish, vampire!

<blank>

The vampire's skin, bathed in sunlight, bubbles like a boil.

The vampire, who was burning himself, flailed his arms and legs violently in an attempt to escape, and continued to scream as if he were tearing up the earth, put more strength into his hand holding the great sword to further energize it.

<blank>

At that time -------- --------

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Shadows covered the world.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard's entire body hair stood on end at that moment, and he instinctively took defensive action.

A moment later, he caught the impact with the "Grand Divider" he pulled out of the vampire as a shield, but was sent flying backward.

<blank>

Ggghh ......, nooooo?

<blank>

At the same time, Conrad's chest was slashed sideways and Gilbert also spurted blood from his back.

Conrad blew out a gopuri of blood from his mouth, shook the earth, and fell to the ground.

<blank>

"Hey, Marina. While I haven't seen you for a while, you've become quite a nice girl, haven't you? Ha-ha-ha!

"...... Ha, Halbert ...... Sir!"

<blank>

The shadow spoke the words.

In his arms, the vampire, burned all over, clutches at the shadows.

<blank>

Shadows linger and sway, blocking the morning sun.

It stood on the edge of a crumbling silvery-white wall, looking down on Howard and his friends from above.

<blank>

Kuha! Did you think the dawn is hope? Kuhahahaha!

<blank>

A man standing in the shadows denies the dawn.

The shadow that the man wears wriggles and spreads wide, covering those present.

<blank>

Now, despair in the name of Hulbert East has descended upon the land.
