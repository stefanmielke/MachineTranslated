# 14 Suzie and the Cloud Family

This is Susie's point of view.


----------------

<blank>

I ran while crying!

I jumped and ran and ran and ran and ran and ran and I hit them from one side to the other, crying!

<blank>

'Uhey ～～～～～～n! What the heck is this number? There are four digits...huh! Huh! Tey! Running away...buh! They're turning...nurya! Hey! Uppuah! Damn it! Nooooo..! Sakanaaaa! Toooooo! I'm so hungry~! Uppii! What's with the ...... chii! So much...dearya! No, it's cancer! Oh...who's..! Whose....pkya! Sei...... Kunu...! Oh! Oh, dear! It's me! It's ...... gupupupo! It's me! It's me! It's me! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

<blank>

<blank>

There are hundreds of them!

They can't even do ranged attacks with their skills.

There is no way they are in a straight line, and the forest is full of obstacles.

We have to slaughter them directly one by one.

In the beginning, I was smashing it with two swords. ......

<blank>

What? Wouldn't it be better to use the limbs together?

Wouldn't it be more efficient to break rocks and shoot finger bullets while you're at it?

<blank>

I'm thinking, "I'm flying around, punching and kicking with my hands and feet.

<blank>

As a result, I ran into bushes, branches, rock surfaces, and the ground, getting hit hard and covered in blood.

The Village Girl's Everyday Clothes" is in shreds! Siksik .......

<blank>

<blank>

He spent an hour or so going around destroying mobs over a wide 10-kilometer radius.

<blank>

What's up, asshole? We're almost done! ...... Damn it, we're less than a kilometer from the human village. That was close. ...... Oh, there are still a few more ahead. Oh, there's still a few more ahead! There's even people here! Oh no!

<blank>

<blank>

In a panic, I flew to the mob I had missed and found a place cut into the forest.

There, a two-headed serpent confronted Grandpa.

<blank>

'Oooh! The first villager is found! But that's not all! There's another snake and about ......10 more wolves. A pack! They're going to surround Grandpa, aren't they? I won't let them!

<blank>

<blank>

He quickly moves in and crushes the wolves one after the other with blows and finger bullets.

<blank>

They may think they're masking their presence, but I can see everything! Whoa! You're awesome, Grandpa! In the blink of an eye, he slayed the snake! Oh, no! Oh, shit! One of them went! Shit!

<blank>

Grandpa killed one snake and then slayed a wolf that jumped in, but he also slayed a wolf that jumped in. ......

<blank>

"I knew that old man was going to do it....... Oh, but the movement is ...... poisonous! It's not good! Oh, shit, just in time!

<blank>

I had a bird's eye view from the tree tops of what looked like a square where my grandfather and his family are now.

Grandpa and the snake are almost in the center of the square.

It is a form of looking right at it from the side.

At any rate, I broke off a branch that was handy and threw it between grandpa and the snake. I threw it between Grandpa and the snake.

<blank>

"Oh, a single stroke, that's great. ...... No, the last dogcatcher is aiming at Grandpa from the other side of the plaza. ...... We have to get rid of the poison, too, or it won't be good for him. ...... No way!"

<blank>

I really wanted to avoid contact with the locals as much as possible, and if I were to enter a human settlement, I would have been more cautious ......, but now is not the time to say so!

I hastily jumped down from the tree and approached Grandpa, and after saying a few words to him, I picked him up in my arms.

<blank>

Okay, keep evacuating them to the other side of the wolf. ...... hmm? Why do I look surprised? Did I say something funny?

Oh well, I'll just have to let them rest in the shade for now!

<blank>

I laid Grandpa down in the shade and immediately went back to the sword I had left in the center.

<blank>

Okay, you dogcatcher, you've changed your aim over here.

I knew it would look bad if I used my bare hands or my own weapon to defeat him in front of his grandfather!

<blank>

With this weapon, it cut off both snakes, so it should be no problem, right?

From the looks of it, I'd say it's mid-zero ranked.

Even a weapon of this level can do that much if it is clothed in Ki.

<blank>

Grandpa was really putting his "Ki" into it, wasn't he?

Hmm? Does ...... mean that Koch people can use "Ki" too?

<blank>

As I was thinking about this while holding the sword, the wolf jumped right at me.

I cut both ways quickly as it was, though!

<blank>

I went back to Grandpa's place immediately and found ...... and it's bad! The poison has progressed quite a bit!

We have to be quick! But what should we do? High level healer skills are indeed over the top, I'm sure they'll be fancy. ......

<blank>

Shall we try to flow "Ki" together with the initial detoxification magic? ...... That would be low-key and unobtrusive, right?

First, we need to get rid of the poison! After that, we'll consider treatment after seeing how the wound is doing!

<blank>

I kneel beside my grandfather, place my palms on the wounds on my legs, and let the "Ki" flow in while chanting antidote magic.

<blank>

to! I'm feeling good! It's like my "Ki" is covering Grandpa. ...... What? The wounds are healing!

I wonder if the restorative element of detoxification magic on top of "Ki" is connected to the activation of cells and ......?

It sounds kind of convoluted, though! Wahaha!

<blank>

Oh, Grandpa was so happy... ♪

What about ......? Huh? Not just? Huh? No double-crossing, no detoxification? Not just normal?

Noooooooo!

<blank>

<blank>

But still, you get what I'm saying right.

The language Grandpa is using is the same as the armor that was up there, after all. I don't know the language, but I know what he is saying.

It's weird. I can hear you, but do you feel like you're talking while finding the words? I wonder if I'm pronouncing the words correctly?

<blank>

Ah, Howard Cloud, are you ......? Hi there! I'm Suzy.

Huh? A-rolla? I don't know.

<blank>

Huh, yes? Where did I come from? Oh, that ...... Oh, that way... but .......

Uhhhhh~! Don't get so excited! It's not good for your blood pressure!

Parents? I don't have any parents! I'm all alone, sorry. ～～～～!

<blank>

<blank>

Ku～～～～～～～～～.......

<blank>

<blank>

! Hagu...... What a stomach with no patience! What a timing!

Ahhhh ...... ahhh! Don't look at me like that!

I'm so embarrassed! I'm sorry!

<blank>

<blank>

Huh? What did you just say?

meals? Cooking? Plenty?

What a violently attractive word! My life has been drained away all at once!

<blank>

Huh? ! Shi-o, huh? Haabu ...... torii?

Gghhhh..! Are you trying to stop me? Are you here to stop me?

Aaah! Oh, my mouth is flooding! My mouth is flooding!

<blank>

Are you sure? Even if I visit your house! Wouldn't that be a nuisance? You don't mind if I visit your house? To your family's lunch!

If someone were to say something nice to me in such an unknown place, I would cry...ohhh!

<blank>

If it were true, it would be outrageous for such a girl (looking like) to follow a man she has never met before to his house. ......

I can't do it! I don't have the confidence to endure such temptation!

<blank>

Please do! It's okay, right? I won't let you go, okay? Take me out to eat! Fuwaimitooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Then, when I came to Mr. Cloud's carriage, which was placed outside the forest, I was surprised!

<blank>

I thought it was a horse because I heard it was a carriage, but it wasn't a ...... horse.

Mr. Cloud says this one is a 'horse'. ......

The silhouette is certainly a 'horse'.

<blank>

But you have scales, right? And hooves? I think they're claws. Or hooves? It's a claw that looks like a hoof! Yes, I know that hooves originally evolved from claws, too. ......

<blank>

And his face, he doesn't have ears, right? His teeth are pointed. ...... This face is a lizard, right?

But its mane and tail are horse~! It's a mysterious creature!

<blank>

Well, I guess this is the "horse" of this world.

I knew I didn't know about this place. ......

<blank>

<blank>

According to Mr. Cloud's story, this place is called Amkam village in the country of Aurora.

<blank>

About 20 kilometers south down the road from here is a town called Copetown, and this horse-drawn carriage said it would take about an hour to get there, so I wonder if this guy can go as fast as a mama's bike.

<blank>

It is said that if you go down 300 kilometers further south from there, you can reach Dekenbel, one of the 12 cities.

And furthermore! About 1,200 kilometers south of there is the "Royal City!

<blank>

The King's City! There is a king! It's a fantasy, noooo!

But from here, it is 1,500 kilometers each way.

It is a distance that runs the length of Honshu.

<blank>

Even a man with super powers who can run at 100 kilometers per hour would take 15 hours.

It's not an easy distance to go.

<blank>

<blank>

In the car, I was repeatedly asked how I got here, to which I could only reply that I was in the woods before I knew it.

<blank>

In fact, that's exactly what it is!

<blank>

I heard that the Iroshio Great Forest, or Amukamu Forest as it is called, is inhabited by many magical beasts and is not a place where a girl like me can be alone.

<blank>

...... Thanks, this Mr. Cloud has been treating me like a child ever since we met. ......

I think this body is an adult. ......... I wonder if there is a discrepancy between the way I, as a Japanese person, see it and the way I feel about it.

<blank>

By the way, a hexenbiest is, from my point of view, a mob.

They say they are magical beasts here.

The snakes and wolves we saw earlier are normally found only in the middle or deeper levels of the mountain, and their appearance so close to the village is an anomaly.

<blank>

A nasty sweat dribbled down my back.

I replied, "It's tough, isn't it?" but I hope my face wasn't scrunched up.

I'm sweating like a pig, okay?

<blank>

Also, those snakes were in a pretty shallow area, ......, and I wanted to make an excuse, but I couldn't say it in stone.

<blank>

<blank>

The carriage went on while we talked about many things, but I enjoyed the scenery of the village along the way.

<blank>

I have never lived in the countryside, and I have only had a quick view of such a rural landscape from a train window, but this was the first time for me to enjoy the fresh breeze as I went along.

<blank>

The surface of Hodgson's Pond, which I was told was a little too large to be a pond, reflected the sun and glistened in the water as it reflected the thicket.

<blank>

The streets lined with poplar trees, combined with the blue sky, made me wonder which calendar photo I was looking at! I felt like, "What kind of calendar picture is this?

<blank>

Wheat fields and the like that stretch all the way to the horizon in the undulating land, I was sighing before I knew I was looking at it.

<blank>

Mr. Cloud looked at me like I was looking at something interesting.

Please don't do it! Don't look at me as if you were looking at such a small animal!

I am somewhat ashamed of myself!

<blank>

In case you are wondering, it seems that this is the only time you can see this view, as harvesting will start all together next week.

Did we come at a good time?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

While we were talking about this, we arrived at the Cloud residence.

<blank>

It was built on a slightly hilly site, surrounded by windbreaks.

It's an L-shaped building with white walls.

It is long from east to west, with one step jutting out from the east side to the south.

<blank>

The roof is a two-tiered angled roof with the slope changing in the middle.

What do you call these roofs?

<blank>

The L-shaped indented portion of the terrace is covered by a shade.

This is the south side.

<blank>

There was a magnificent door on the first floor on the west gable side.

So this is the front door.

<blank>

A woman was standing alone in front of that doorway.

I think it is Mr. Cloud's wife.

I'd say she's in her fifties. Her ashy green eyes sparkle and her beautiful chestnut brown hair is tucked on top of her head in a fluffy bun.

<blank>

She looks like a classy and gentle wife to look at.

<blank>

<blank>

When we stopped the carriage and got off, Mr. Cloud took my hand and helped me get off.

I'll be there! Mr. Cloud, you are a real gentleman!

I look like a lady!

Haha! I'm a little bit in the mood now, so I've tried to act classy!

<blank>

When his wife asked me who I was, I thought I would greet her like a lady.　I decided to greet her like a lady.

<blank>

However, I don't know any Western-style greetings like "pick up your skirt," so I'm going to follow Japanese business etiquette and send you an email to .......

Correct your posture, lay your hands in front of your body, look into their eyes, introduce yourself, and bow politely.

<blank>

What do you think? I think it was a beautiful posture, don't you?

<blank>

His wife kindly introduced herself back to me.

<blank>

Nice to meet you, I am Sonia Cloud, Howard's wife. Nice to meet you, Susie. You're a lovely young lady."

<blank>

I got a very soft smile back! I was so happy!

<blank>

Huh? Huh? Pretty little girl, huh? Are you still treating me like a child?

<blank>

I mean, you know! I didn't realize it before because I didn't have anyone to compare myself to. ...... I'm short, aren't I?

I know you're a big guy, but ...... your eye line is right around Sonia's chest.

I'm guessing the height difference is more than 10 cm.

<blank>

As I was thinking about this while smiling like a lady, Sonia rushed over to me with a worried look on her face when Cloud told her that she saved his life.

<blank>

Oh, it's all right now!

I was about to smile even more with ...... when that guy came out of nowhere!

<blank>

<blank>

Gurugiru .......

<blank>

<blank>

Gghhhh! (exhales blood)

<blank>

Co, this guy (stomach)! You betray the Lord not once, but twice!

<blank>

Sure, sure, sure! Since I entered this property! I could smell the amazing aroma wafting through the air! My mouth was about to be flooded, but I held it in!

<blank>

Like earlier, like now! What? This timing!

What? This huge sound!

<blank>

I was acting all ladylike and proper at ....... Oh, no! I'm screwed!

<blank>

What's more! The skin you put on me was instantly peeled off, like ringing me in front of Sonia, a real lady I just met!

What is this shame play! I can't lift my face up...ohhh...! Uhi～～～～n!

<blank>

<blank>

I was shaking with shame, and there was a guy next to me who was blowing things out with great force!

<blank>

Ugh ...... and I can't believe it! I can't believe it, Mr. Cloud!

You knew I was hungry!

And yet, and yet! I can't believe you laughed at me like that!

...... Oh, I feel like crying.

I'm gonna cry, okay? I'll cry!

<blank>

<blank>

I was pulling and Sonia came by and wiped my face.

...... Oh, my clean apron is getting dirty. ......

Did he wipe them off with his apron before they started crying?

<blank>

Sonia, you really are a kind person...!

<blank>

<blank>

So I ended up being allowed to take a bath.

Bath!

I've bathed in the water since I came here, but this is the first time I've taken a bath! I'm getting a little happy.

<blank>

When I arrived at the bathroom, a person named Elrose was preparing the bathtub.

<blank>

Ms. Elrose was a shapely woman compared to the slim Sonia.

I wouldn't call her fat, but more like a motherly figure. She exudes strength.

Is she a little taller than Sonia?

<blank>

Her black hair, mixed with gray, is packed in a tight bun, forming a dumpling on her head.

I'm guessing your age is older than Sonia, not in your 60's?

<blank>

After leaving me with Elrose, Sonia said she would get me a change of clothes and left the bathroom.

<blank>

<blank>

Elrose put her hands on her hips and gave me one quick look from top to bottom, then hummed and blew her nose and said, "Banzai." I raised my arms and .......

<blank>

Papa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa! and stripped naked at once!

Without time to be surprised or embarrassed, she was held up and placed in the bathtub as she was.

<blank>

The bathtub was only about half full, but it was like a half-body bath, soaking up to the stomach. It was a little bit comfortable.

In this state, I was showered with hot water over my head.

I was apoplectic, but the warm shower still felt so good that I let out an "Aaahhh ～～～～" sound.

<blank>

I feel like Elrose was just chuckling. ......

<blank>

After that, my head was scrubbed with shampoo and my whole body was washed with a huge sponge.

That's the way it was, everything was seen in its entirety and washed away.

<blank>

And yet! Is it only us who are ashamed?

Mr. Elrose doesn't seem bothered at all.

I feel like he is very used to this kind of thing (like giving a child a bath?). I feel like he is very familiar with this kind of thing (like bathing children?).

Perhaps this person has also identified you as a child?

<blank>

<blank>

As I was washing off the foam from my body, Sonia returned with a change of clothes.

<blank>

Thank you, Elrose. I'll get dressed, you get ready to eat."

<blank>

I was giving instructions to Elrose while Sonia wrapped my body in a towel she had brought with her.

Ms. Elrose bowed and immediately left the bathroom.

<blank>

<blank>

I asked her to wrap a towel around my body, and Sonia brought me some equipment.

I thought it looked like a hair dryer, and it was a hair dryer!

<blank>

When my hair is roughly dry, I begin to put on the underwear that Sonia brought me.

Let's see! Pink striped pants!

<blank>

But it's very embarrassing to put on pants while people are looking at you!

Is the bra a sports type? It stretched like a shirt and fit just right.

<blank>

Oh? It looks like it fits you just right. I thought it would fit by the looks of it, but I'm glad."

<blank>

So says Sonia, smiling and looking on.

<blank>

<blank>

Her clothes were a pale blue one-piece dress.

I was allowed to put it on by zipping it up from the skirt.

It's collarless, round-necked, with a white line around the neck.

The throat was open, so after putting the neck through, he tied a string through it to make a bowline knot.

<blank>

He then brushed my hair in front of the mirror.

Come to think of it, brushing is a new experience for me.

It felt good, but I was somewhat embarrassed and couldn't look at myself in the mirror.

<blank>

Sonia seemed to be in a good mood from start to finish.

He brushes them off happily, but his calm gaze is even more embarrassing.

<blank>

After brushing my hair, she tied it back in a beautiful light blue string.

<blank>

Sorry for the delay.

<blank>

Sonia brought me to the dining hall and apologized to Cloud at the entrance for keeping him waiting.

Mr. Cloud looks at me in surprise.

<blank>

Well, that's because it was polished up! You look different! I know you look different, but please don't be embarrassed if I see you looking at me like that!

<blank>

When Elrose showed me to my seat, I saw heaven spread out before me!

The savory smell of birds and spices that tickle the nose!

<blank>

Watch out! This is a mouth water alert! Those in the vicinity should be fully alert and never approach the mouth!

<blank>

Oh, my bad. Your body was in front of you. ......

<blank>

Mr. Howard gave us permission to eat.

Elrose carves the bird and places it on a plate in front of me.

<blank>

By cutting open the bird, the aroma of the vegetables and herbs inside flooded the air at once!

The aroma that came with the carved chicken meat attacked my nostrils directly.

<blank>

I was dizzy. I'm sure that from the side I must have been able to see my eyes whirling around in circles.

<blank>

Cut the fillet into bite-sized pieces and bring the fillet in front of you, sticking it in front of you with a fork.

It's okay, right?

You wouldn't say no after all, would you?

Uso pi~~~n! I'm sure you won't say that!

<blank>

See Mr. Cloud.

He smiled and nodded broadly.

All right! I'll eat it! I'll take a bite.

・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・ ・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・ mmmmahhhh ！！！！

What a juicy treat! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's so good!

The juices were so ju~~~~! Both sides of the tongue tongue are sizzling!

The flavor! U! Ma! Mi! Gah!

<blank>

Ahh..! I love omelettes made with sweet potatoes!

What a terrible saltiness!

Ohhhh! I'm so happy to have a taste!

<blank>

My hands! My mouth! I can't stop~~!

Eggu...... is so delicious! Hahugu .......

I can cry ...... on my own ......, kuriu~~...... eggu...... delicious! ...... yo ～～～～......!

<blank>

I just ate the heck out of it! Eggy and crying. ......

I thought I had never eaten such delicious food before.

I can't help but cry on my own because the emotion is so happy!

<blank>

Sonia and Elrose took care of the food together.

I'm a toddler now! I was so excited.

But I was so happy that I let them do it to me.

<blank>

Sonia's mothering skills were unbelievable, wiping away tears and food scraps.

From now on, I will secretly call you Sonia-mama in my heart!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The tea Elrose brewed for us after dinner was delicious. ......

<blank>

Right, there was such a thing as tea in this world, wasn't there? I forgot about it until just now.

I learned for the first time that a good cup of tea after a meal can make people so happy.

<blank>

In the afterglow of happiness, Mr. Cloud was telling Sonia what had happened today.

<blank>

When Sonia and Elrose heard that we had cut off the wolf, they rolled their eyes and were amazed.

Hmmm, I just cut it with Mr. Cloud's sword. ......

<blank>

At ......, Mr. Cloud seems to be planning to take me somewhere after this ...... temple?

<blank>

Sonia, are you and Elrose parting ways now? We just got to know each other. ...... What? You'll be back soon? Oh, yeah. ...... hehe.

<blank>

Yeah? Shika? Venison steaks and such? Oooh! Aagaru... ......

UGH! Sonia told me you're a foodie. ......

Gosh, it was confirmed that in Ms. Elrose's eyes, she looks like a growing child!

<blank>

Ah, but still, it's nice to share a meal together like this, isn't it?

Not only is it delicious, it's fun.

<blank>

I'm looking forward to dinner now, huh? No, I'm looking forward to the deer, too, though!

But I also think this kind of thing is ...... good. ......
