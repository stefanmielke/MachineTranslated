Invited and inviting, it's the Harvest Festival! Hyaffu!!

【Amukamu Harvest Festival】

A festival dedicated to the Earth Mother, offering thanks for the year's harvest and wishing for abundance and safety in the coming year.

<b>

The Harvest Festival is a major event in the village, held for a week every year during the fifth month of the Red Moon.

As a first-timer, I was already excitedly waiting for that day.

<b>

The main venue is a large square located on the south side of 'Ichi no Tsukisho.'

This large square is connected by a straight road to the Amukamu House.

You could say it's the main street of Amukamu.

<b>

During the Harvest Festival, this several hundred-meter-long road is decorated, lined with stalls, and parades go back and forth.

On the final day of the festival, a giant straw effigy erected in the square is set on fire, marking the end of the festivities.

<b>

Originally, the Harvest Festival was just one day on that final day, but somehow the week meant for preparations has also become part of the festival.

<b>

During that week, traveling performers and bands gather in the village, performing in the square and parading down the main street.

The villagers join in, wearing masks and costumes, dancing down the streets.

It’s a lively scene that feels like a mix of Halloween, Awa Odori, and Yosakoi.

<b>

This Harvest Festival attracts not only people from the village of Amukamu but also from neighboring villages and Coop Town.

In short, it's a festival of the former Amukamu Barony.

So, the excitement during this time is truly immense!

<b>

During this time, the Cloud family becomes the village's main hosts, spending most of the week together at Amukamu House.

I had no idea there were special rooms for the Cloud family in that castle!!

<b>

Papa Howard was dressed sharply in a formal tuxedo, looking dandy in a way he usually doesn't show.

He looked just like a real count or nobleman, how wonderful!

Mama Sonia also elegantly styled her hair and wore beautiful dresses, changing them daily to entertain the guests.

Mama Sonia's appearance and demeanor were truly that of a noble lady! So wonderful! Too wonderful!!

<b>

Last month, I officially registered as their adopted daughter, and I was to greet Papa Howard and Mama Sonia together.

The dress I was put in was pure white and off-the-shoulder, meant for a ball.

The tiered skirt, layered and flared, was full of frills, making me feel like some kind of princess.

When my hair was styled up and a small tiara was placed on my head, Mama Sonia said, "Look, my princess is complete," and I felt like I could die from embarrassment!!

The maids at Amukamu House who helped dress me, and even Elrose, were all smiling and nodding repeatedly!

<b>

For the ball greeting, I was told to just introduce myself and smile.

But… being sandwiched between Papa and Mama, the tension was overwhelming, you know?!

I’m just a commoner! I’m not suited for this kind of thing!!

<b>

However, it was very reassuring that Bibi was always nearby to support me.

<b>

"You need to start behaving like a daughter of the Cloud family soon!"

<b>

Bibi said to me…

Huh? What is this girl talking about?

It sounds as if I’m some kind of well-bred young lady, doesn’t it?

This special outfit is only for the festival, you know? What a silly thing to say!

When I told Bibi this, she shrugged her shoulders with an exasperated look and sighed.

What’s that?! I don’t get it!!

<b>

Even so, during the daily parades, I would sneak out to enjoy buying food from the stalls with everyone, and sometimes even participate in the parades, having a fun week.

<b>

The final day of the Harvest Festival culminates in the burning of the effigy.

There’s an old saying that if you watch the burning while holding hands, your bond will last forever.

So, it’s customary in this village for close friends to invite each other to watch the burning together.

<b>

On that day, Mia came to pick me up, and we headed to the square together.

<b>

When Mia arrived, Mama Sonia and Elrose had subtle expressions, while Papa Howard looked relieved and happy to see us off.

…What was that? Something felt a bit strange?

<b>

When we arrived at the square, Colin and Dana were there, along with Helena and Mary.

<b>

"Hey? Where's Bibi? Isn't she coming? Aren't we going to pick her up?"

<b>

I asked Mia.

<b>

"…Bibi-chan, well… she got kidnapped."

<b>

Mia said something that didn’t quite make sense.

What does that mean? Does it mean she’s with someone?

<b>

<b>

Until the burning began, we all wandered around the stalls in the square, buying and eating various things.

The market-like scene, which you wouldn’t normally see in the village, naturally raised our spirits.

Skewered meat, baked sweets, and fruit in syrup—it's hard not to buy more than necessary, right?

<b>

<b>

Eventually, it was time, and the effigy was set ablaze.

A tower shaped like a human, standing 15 meters tall, was filled with straw and set on fire.

Originally, it was said to be burned as an offering of thanks to the Earth Mother for the year’s harvest and catch.

<b>

"Isn't it beautiful? Suu."

"Yeah, amazing... right?"

"Let's stay together forever, Suu-chan."

<b>

I was holding hands with Mia and Dana, looking up at the burning effigy.

<b>

"…It would have been nice if Bibi was here too..."

<b>

That whisper slipped from my lips. Then Dana said…

<b>

"I think Bibi is over there…"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was an ancient tree standing on a slight hill to the southwest of the square.

From there, you could see the burning very well.

<b>

I knew about that ancient tree.

It was a giant tree resembling a zelkova, said to be 1,000 years old.

It could be seen from most places in the village, serving as a directional landmark.

<b>

So, somehow, we all decided to head over to the hill where the ancient tree was.

<b>

"On the night of the Harvest Festival, if two people who have feelings for each other kiss while illuminated by the flames of this ancient tree… they will be eternally happy, or so the legend goes."

<b>

Colin shared that story as we climbed the hill.

<b>

What? What a sparkling legend?!

Is it about the legendary ancient tree?!

Who started talking about love or hate, I wonder? I wonder?!!

Is it love me please?!

<b>

"Too bad! Will went home!"

<b>

Dana said with a grin as she poked Colin.

<b>

"Come on! But you said you’d watch it with me next year…"

<b>

Colin replied to Dana, blushing, but by the end, he mumbled and looked down.

Ahh, what is this?

I suddenly felt the urge to squeeze some meat!

Well, if I did it now, I feel like I’d get retaliated against, so I won’t…

<b>

<b>

Eventually, when we reached the top of the hill, Dana put her finger to her lips, signaling us to be quiet.

We quietly advanced, trying to hide our presence until we could see the ancient tree, and… indeed, there were two figures by the ancient tree!

<b>

The top of the hill was like a small park with a diameter of about 20 meters centered around the ancient tree.

Surrounded by dense shrubbery, we hid there and observed.

From our viewpoint, the right side of the area had a gap in the shrubbery, allowing us to see the light of the burning effigy clearly.

The ancient tree was diagonally to the left from here.

In front of that ancient tree stood two people.

<b>

<b>

From here, I couldn’t see their faces, but the back of the boy visible there—could that be Arvin?

The small figure slightly hidden behind him had Bibi’s face illuminated by the faint glow of the flames.

<b>

<b>

I heard a gulp.

It was Helena, who was gripping my right sleeve tightly.

Mary, next to her, kept murmuring, "Adult? Adult? Adult?"

<b>

<b>

Did Arvin say something? Bibi looked up at him in surprise.

In the dark, with only the faint glow of the flames, I could see a blush on her cheeks.

<b>

<b>

"Suu-chan, Suu-chan. Suu-chan! Suu-chan!!"

<b>

Mia shook my shoulder.

Her chest was bouncing and hitting my back!

<b>

I felt like the distance between the two was closing.

Bibi kept her face up and closed her eyes.

<b>

Dana and Colin also leaned forward!

Everyone was holding their breath and leaning in.

Oh, please don’t roll out of here?!

<b>

<b>

The space between the two gradually narrowed until it seemed to reach zero… at that moment!!!

<b>

<b>

From the bushes across from us, multiple figures tumbled out with a rustle!

<b>

Alan, Bernap, and Lombard!

Bibi and Arvin froze and trembled at the sight of the three.

What foolish boys!!!

After all, we were quietly and warmly watching them! You ruined it!

Everyone on this side was frozen in shock too!!

<b>

Alan, scratching his head, was doing something awkwardly cute towards the two!

No way… I can’t leave this as it is!!

In any case! I must quickly resolve this situation!!!

<b>

I immediately dashed out of the bushes and moved at lightning speed to the three.

Without hesitation, I picked up the biggest one, Lombard, and grabbed Alan and Bernap by their sides, swiftly returning to our original spot.

Then, I threw Bernap and Lombard behind Mia and Dana, who were already bursting out of the bushes.

When I picked up Alan, he made some kind of sexual harassment comment about the feeling of my cheek touching him, so I threw him much farther away than the other two!

<b>

After finishing that task, I clapped my hands together to dust them off, and I noticed Arvin and Bibi, who were frozen behind me, staring at me with wide eyes.

<b>

Uh-oh? Did I just mess up?

As I turned my neck, sweating a little, I locked eyes with the two.

Oh, both of them had bright red faces, and their mouths were twitching.

<b>

At that moment, I felt my own cheeks heating up from the awkwardness.

My mouth was twitching too.

Oh, whatever! I thought, and I gave the two a thumbs up with a

<b>

"You can do it... okay?!"

<b>

And I encouraged them, quickly grabbing the napes of Mia and Dana, and retreated from the scene!

<b>

"Can we really do it?!!"

<b>

The two's harmonized cries echoed into the night sky.

<b>

The flames of the burning effigy scorched the autumn night sky, marking a memorable first night of the Harvest Festival.
