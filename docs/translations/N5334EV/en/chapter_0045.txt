Amkamu Harvest Festival

A festival in which the harvest of the year is dedicated to Jibojin, offering thanks for the year and wishing for a bountiful and safe harvest for the following year.

<blank>

The harvest festival is a major event in the village, held for a week in the red month of 5 every year.

As a first-timer, I was already excited and eagerly awaiting the day of the event.

<blank>

The main venue is a large plaza on the south side of "I no Tsumesho".

This grand plaza and the Amkam House are connected by a single straight road.

It is, so to speak, the main street of Amkam.

<blank>

During the Harvest Festival, this several-hundred-meter stretch of road is decorated, lined with stalls, and parades go back and forth.

On the last day of the festival, they light a huge straw doll erected in the main square and burn it to end the festival.

<blank>

The original Harvest Festival was only held on the last day of the festival, but somehow the week-long preparation period became part of the festival.

<blank>

During that week, traveling performers and bands gather in the village, perform in the square, and parade down the main street.

The villagers join in the fun and dance through the streets wearing masks and costumes.

It was as if Halloween, Awa Odori, Yosakoi, etc. were all combined.

<blank>

This harvest festival attracts people not only from the village of Amkam, but also from neighboring villages and Copetown.

In short, it is a festival in the former Count Amkam territory.

So, the crowds at this time are really quite a big deal!

<blank>

I was told that the Cloud family would be the main hosts of the village for this occasion only, and that the whole family would spend most of the week at the Amkam House.

I didn't know that there was a room in that residence exclusively for the Cloud family!

<blank>

Howard Papa looked dapper and dandy in a formal tuxedo that he usually doesn't show.

It's like a real count or nobleman!

Sonia Mama also had her hair beautifully tied up and wore a lovely, classy dress for each day of the week to entertain the guests.

Sonia Mama's appearance and behavior are just like that of a noble wife! She's so nice! Too nice!

<blank>

Last month, I was officially registered as an adopted daughter, and I was also invited to join Howard's father and Sonia's mother in greeting them.

The dress she was dressed in was pure white and shoulder-baring for evening parties.

The tiered skirt, with its layers and layers of fluttering ruffles, makes her look like a princess somewhere. It looks like a princess somewhere.

Once my hair was tied up and even a little tiara was attached, Sonia-mama said to me, "Look, my princess is complete," and I almost died of shame!

Even the maids at the Amukam House who helped me dress and Ms. Elrose smiled and nodded her head many times!

<blank>

They told me to introduce myself and just smile when I greeted them at the evening meeting....

When you are sandwiched between such a dad and mom, there is a lot of tension, you know?

I am a commoner! I'm not cut out for this kind of thing!

<blank>

But it was very reassuring that Bibi was always close by and followed me.

<blank>

It's about time you learned how to behave as the Cloud family's own daughter!"

<blank>

And Bibi told me....

Huh? What are you talking about?

You talk about me as if I'm some nice young lady.

This special outfit is only for the festival, right? He's starting to say some funny things!

When I said this to Bibi, he cowered his shoulders and let out a sigh with a look of disgust on his face.

What is that? I can't figure it out!

<blank>

Nevertheless, I slipped out during the daily parade and spent a pleasant week with everyone, buying and eating at food stalls and watching, and sometimes even participating in the parade.

<blank>

The final day of the Harvest Festival will be finalized with the burning of human figures.

There is an old saying that if you look at them hand in hand, the bond will last forever and ever.

It is the custom in this village to invite those who are close to each other to watch the bonfire.

<blank>

Mia picked me up that day and we both decided to head to the plaza together.

<blank>

When Mia arrived, Sonia-mama and Elrose-san looked subtle, while Howard-papa looked relieved and happy to see us off.

What is it about ......? That was a little weird, wasn't it?

<blank>

When we arrived at the plaza, Colin and Dana were there, and Helena and Mary joined us.

<blank>

What?" Where's Bibi? He didn't come? Aren't you going to pick him up?"

<blank>

I asked Mia.

<blank>

"...Vivi, you know, she's been kidnapped by ......."

<blank>

I was not sure what he was talking about.

What's that? In short, does it mean I'm here with someone else?

<blank>

<blank>

Until the bonfires started, everyone went around to the food stalls in the plaza to buy and eat various foods.

A market-like scene not usually seen in the village is as exciting as it is commonplace.

We can't help but buy more than we need, like grilled meat on skewers, baked goods, or fruit with honey, can we?

<blank>

<blank>

Eventually, it was time to go and the human figure was lit.

A 15-meter-high human-shaped turret is filled with straw, which is then lit on fire.

Originally, the harvest or catch of the year was burned to offer thanks to the Earth Mother Goddess....

<blank>

Isn't she beautiful? Sue."

Yeah, it's great... right?"

We'll be together forever, Sue."

<blank>

I was holding hands with Mia and Dana and the others, looking up at the bonfire.

<blank>

I wish Bibi was with me.

<blank>

Such a murmur escaped my mouth. Then Dana....

<blank>

Don't think maybe Bibi is over there. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It is an old tree that stands on a slight hill to the southwest of this plaza.

From there, he said, one can get a good view of the bonfire.

<blank>

I knew about that old tree.

It is a huge tree similar to a zelkova and is said to be 1,000 years old.

It could be seen from most places in the village and served as a guide for direction in the village.

<blank>

So, somehow we all decided to zigzag up to the hill where the old tree was located and take a look.

<blank>

Legend has it that on the night of the Harvest Festival, if two people who are in love with each other kiss each other by this ancient tree under the light of the fire, they will be happy forever.

<blank>

Colin told me such stories as we climbed the hill.

<blank>

What is it? What is that sparkling legend?

Is it the legendary old tree?

I wonder who started the whole "like it or not" thing? I wonder who said they liked it or disliked it?

I wonder if it's Labumipuriz?

<blank>

I'm sorry to hear that! Will's gone home!"

<blank>

Dana poked Colin with a grin.

<blank>

Already." So, but next year... the one you said you'd see with me next year: ......"

<blank>

Colin was talking back to Dana with a tinge in his cheeks, but he looked down, moping at the end.

Oh~ what is this?

I'm tempted to just niggle at the depraved flesh!

Well, I don't want to because I have a feeling that if I do now, I'll get blowback. ......

<blank>

<blank>

When they eventually reach the top of the hill, Dana puts her index finger to her mouth and tells them to be quiet.

We quietly proceeded to where we could see the old tree, killing all signs of life...and sure enough, there were two figures at the side of the old tree!

<blank>

The hilltop was like a little park about 20 meters in diameter, centered around an old tree.

The area around it was overgrown with vegetation, and we hid ourselves there and looked around to see what was going on.

Looking from here, the direction to the right was broken by plantings, and the light of the fire for the bonfire could be seen clearly.

The old tree is diagonally to the left from here.

Two people were in front of that old tree.

<blank>

<blank>

I can't make out his face from here, but the boy's back that I can see, is that Irving?

A small figure, slightly hidden behind it, peeked out at Bibi's face, which was illuminated by the slight brightness of the flames.

<blank>

<blank>

I heard the sound of gulping.

It was Helena, who was gripping my right sleeve as hard as she could.

And Mary next to her... Adult? Adult? Otona?　She keeps muttering, "Otona?

<blank>

<blank>

Irving said something, and Bibi looked up at Irving with a huff.

In the dark, with only the faint light of the fire, I could see the blush on his cheeks.

<blank>

<blank>

Sue-chan, Sue-chan. Sue-chan! Sue-chan!"

<blank>

Mia shook my shoulder.

Her breasts were also swaying together and hitting my back!

<blank>

I feel that the distance between their faces has shortened.

Bibi meditated with his face turned up.

<blank>

Dana and Colin guiuiiiiied, too! They came leaning in!

All of us go to the front with bated breath.

Oh, please don't roll out, okay?

<blank>

<blank>

Just when it seemed that the space between them was gradually narrowing and would eventually reach zero ......!

<blank>

<blank>

From the bushes on the opposite side of the street, a rustling sound of a clattering noise!　and multiple figures rolling out of the bushes on the opposite side!

<blank>

Alan, Belknap, and Lombardo!

Bibi and Irvin both freeze and pull when they see the three of us.

Nan, you silly boys!

We were all watching you quietly and warmly! You're ruining it!

The Kochs are all frozen up because of the sheer magnitude of the situation!

<blank>

Alan is scratching his head as he does something very KY like, "Tehepero!

No. ...... can't keep this up!

Anyway! We must somehow settle this situation as soon as possible!

<blank>

I immediately jumped out of the bushes and moved at lightning speed to the three of them.

Without a pause, he carries Lombard, the largest of the two, with Alain and Belknap at his sides, and returns to his original location on blinking feet.

Then, he threw Belknap and Lombardo behind Mia and Dana, who were running out of the bushes.

Only Alan, when he held it in his arms, said something sexually harassing like, "What a happy feeling on your cheeks...?　I threw him farther away than the two of them!

<blank>

After I had finished my work, I clapped my hands and brushed off the dust, and noticed Irving and Bibi frozen behind me, staring at me with their eyes wide open.

<blank>

Oh, what is it? Did I do something wrong?

I turned my head to see them, and my eyes met theirs perfectly.

Oh, they both have bright red faces and their mouths are twitching.

<blank>

As it was, I could feel my cheeks turning red with awkwardness.

My mouth was still twitching, too.

Oh, God! Whatever! I thought, and sent a thumbs up to both of them!　and send them both a thumbs up.

<blank>

Good luck with that, okay?

<blank>

He gave a pep talk and quickly grabbed the rolling Mia and Dana by the neck and withdrew from the scene!

<blank>

I can't do my best. ～～～～!

<blank>

Their cries, harmonizing well with each other, echo in the night sky and fade away.

<blank>

It was a memorable night of the first harvest festival, with the flames of the bonfire scorching the autumn night sky.
