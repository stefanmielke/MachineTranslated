# Chapter 136: Jules Nahl's Regret

Jules Nahl was consumed by intense feelings of regret.

Why did I take that job back then?!

<b>

From the very beginning, I should have had a bad feeling about it. Yet, in the end, I ended up accepting it.

Normally, I would never take on a job like that, so what whim led me to do so?!

<b>

Abel is a big shot in this red-light district.

Even when I came here before, I had to deal with the whims of my employer.

Once again, when I finally made it here, I had also received favors from him.

The job was just a simple guiding role. There was no reason to flatly refuse.

I was told I could refuse, but turning it down would also mean ruining his face.

Normally, I wouldn't care about such things, but for some reason, at that moment, it bothered me.

A bad atmosphere was definitely lingering, but I felt it wasn't life-threatening.

<b>

Well, if it comes to that, I can just turn tail and run.

<b>

Afterward, I genuinely thought I wanted to punch the part of me that casually agreed to it.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Those kids were strays from abroad.

Recently, they had begun to expand their influence in this city and were being shunned by the older organizations.

Why Abel, one of the heads of those older organizations, was taking care of such a group was beyond Jules Nahl's understanding.

However, from Abel's irritating tone, it was easy to imagine that there were some unsavory dealings going on behind the scenes.

<b>

From Jules Nahl's perspective, getting caught up in the mess between organizations was the last thing he wanted. For now, he decided to gather information and avoid getting too involved.

So this time, he decided to focus solely on the fact that the reward and payment were good.

<b>

<b>

The job was to be a guide for the kids carrying the cargo.

In essence, it was about choosing a route to avoid detection while transporting dangerous goods to the destination.

<b>

As expected, the kids were just brats.

<b>

They were completely in a playful mood, having a blast.

It was like supervising children.

They had no intention of doing their job properly.

If it were just them, they would undoubtedly get caught by the guards before even reaching a third of the way.

<b>

<b>

It took longer than planned, but somehow they managed to reach the destination.

After that, the job would be over once they received proof of receipt from the other party.

If I hand this over to the kids' leader and get my reward, I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore.

<b>

Since I hadn't promised to look after them on the way back, if they got caught again while messing around, that wouldn't be my concern. I planned to abandon them without a second thought at that point.

<b>

As expected, the kids did it.

One of the kids spotted a special carriage in the distance and suggested they attack it. The others quickly got excited and started making a fuss.

<b>

Are they stupid or what?!

Special carriages are used by those with power, like former nobles. If they attacked something like that, they would definitely attract the attention of the knight order, making it impossible to live around here.

<b>

They must be kids because they can't even understand such common sense! I had no obligation to entertain these fools.

When I said I was in a hurry, they started teasing me, saying I was acting all high and mighty but was actually scared.

But who cares!

<b>

These kids were definitely done for here.

The alarm inside me was ringing at full volume.

If I stayed here, I would undoubtedly be in trouble! I had to get away from here as fast as I could.

<b>

I urged my horse to run through the trees of the forest. Even though I was more than a kilometer away, the alarm still hadn't stopped.

<b>

Is something chasing me? I glanced back, but there was no sign of being pursued.

But the alarm wouldn't stop. On the contrary, I felt the threat growing larger.

Cold sweat dripped down.

<b>

I couldn't shake the feeling that my death was looming right around the corner.

Unknowingly, my breathing had become ragged.

The sweat running down my back felt cold.

It was as if the grim reaper was standing right behind me, pressing a palm that symbolized death firmly against my back.

<b>

I zigzagged my horse as if trying to shake off something incomprehensible, but that feeling wouldn't go away.

I looked back repeatedly, but of course, there was nothing there.

Even though I knew nothing was there, I couldn't help but check behind me.

<b>

The sweat was flowing so much that it got into my eyes.

I continued to breathe heavily, as if hyperventilating, my mouth dry and my tongue sticking to my lower jaw.

My heart continued to pound loudly, causing pain deep in my ears.

<b>

I'm going to die! This is death. There's no doubt about it!!

<b>

Jules Nahl was convinced that he would be crushed by the overwhelming presence of death, which felt as massive as a wall he had never experienced in his life.

<b>

<b>

<b>

However, it suddenly vanished.

<b>

I remembered that I had completely forgotten to breathe.

I forcefully contracted my lungs and resumed the act of breathing, making a wheezing sound.

<b>

I finally managed to open the cap of my canteen with trembling hands and gulped down its contents without pausing for breath.

At the same time, I began to feel the coldness of my sweat-soaked back.

I hurriedly urged my horse to run, wanting to reach a safe place as soon as possible.

That thought alone occupied Jules Nahl's mind at that moment.

<b>

The town of Palus felt anything but safe to Jules Nahl.

After changing horses in town, he quickly obtained water and food, then rode straight to Deckenbel without taking a break.

By the time he arrived in Deckenbel, he looked like a tired, colorless person, as if he had aged ten years in an instant.

<b>

After receiving his reward, he went straight back to his regular lodging, where he slept soundly until morning without waking up even once.

<b>

<b>

After waking up, he heard that those kids had indeed been caught, but that was none of his business. He should consider himself lucky just to be alive.

<b>

It was a story from over a month ago, but even now, recalling it sends a shiver down his spine.

<b>

That's right, it was a story from over a month ago.

<b>

Why, then, am I now haunted by the same chill as back then?

I really shouldn't have taken that job!

<b>

I know it doesn't help to regret it now, but there's no doubt that the choices I made back then led to my current situation. My instincts are affirming this with all their might.

<b>

Damn it! Another dead end!

What the hell is going on, damn it?!

<b>

It's not that the road is actually blocked.

But the warning inside me is blaring at maximum volume, saying that there is no future beyond this point.

<b>

Damn it! Shit! Is this place also blocked?! Is it this way?!

The road... The road...........!

<b>

I finally realized that there was no escape left.

I was certain that an absolute presence was closing in behind me.

<b>

I was out of breath.

The sweat was unbearably cold.

Just like back then.

<b>

Clinging pathetically to the dead-end wall of the alley, I knew that all I could do now was wait for the final judgment.

<b>

The street visible from the alley was bustling with people, filled with the lively noise typical of a night in the entertainment district.

Even though a world overflowing with the lights of nightclubs was just a few meters away, why did this place feel so heavy, hard, and dark?

It seemed impossible that these two places could exist in the same location.

<b>

It felt as if I were looking at an entirely different world through glass, creating a sense of isolation.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Bathed in the bright lights of the city, it appeared before me from around the corner.

Without any hesitation, it stepped into the alley where I was.

<b>

The light from the bars illuminated its back, and the way it moved forward like a flowing silhouette could easily be described as ghostly.

<b>

The grim reaper stopped in front of Jules Nahl.

And in silhouette, with both hands on its hips, it slowly opened its mouth.

<b>

"I found you."

<b>

With a voice that was surprisingly sweet for its presence, it looked down at Jules Nahl and simply said that one line.
