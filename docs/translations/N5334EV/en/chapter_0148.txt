# 136 Jules Nard's Regrets

Jules Nard was seized with intense remorse.

Why did I take the job then?

<blank>

I must have had a bad premonition from the beginning. But as it turned out, I ended up accepting the offer.

It was a job that I would never have taken on under my normal circumstances, but what whim made me do so?

<blank>

Abel is the face of this colorful town.

When I was here before, I went to a lot of trouble to accommodate my employer's selfishness.

When I finally arrived here again, I was also indebted to him for taking care of me in some way.

The job is just a guide. There is no reason for me to refuse.

I was told I could refuse, but to refuse would be to ruin his face.

Normally, I would not care about such other people's affairs, but for some reason, this was the only time I cared about them.

The atmosphere was unpleasant, but not life-threatening.

<blank>

Well, if push comes to shove, just roll up your ass and run away.

<blank>

Afterward, I really wanted to beat myself up for taking such a cheap shot at it.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Those kids are outliers from out of state.

In recent years, they have begun to grow in power in this city and have been smoked out by the old organizations.

Why Abel, the head of one of the oldest organizations in the world, is taking care of such people is beyond Jules Nard's knowledge.

However, it is easy to imagine that there must have been some kind of a bad deal going on behind the scenes, judging from Abel's abhorrent tone of voice.

<blank>

From Jules Nard's point of view, he did not want to get involved in the inter-organizational mess. In the meantime, to avoid such a situation, he decided to just get the information and avoid getting too deeply involved.

So this time, I decided to keep in mind that I was dealing with someone who was well paid and well compensated.

<blank>

<blank>

My job is to guide the kids as they carry their cargo.

The point is that you are carrying a dangerous cargo, so choose a route and take them to their destination undetected. The point is that they are carrying a dangerous cargo.

<blank>

Sure enough, the kids were brats.

<blank>

It's completely playful and dry.

It's totally child led.

There is no desire to work in a mature manner.

If it were just these guys, they would definitely not make it a third of the way and end up being captured by the guards.

<blank>

<blank>

It took longer than planned, but we managed to reach our destination.

The work is done when we receive a certificate of receipt from the recipient.

If you give this to the masters of these kids and get a reward, you will never have to deal with these guys again.

<blank>

I have not promised to take care of them on the way home, so it is none of my business if they get caught as a result of their agitation again. If they get caught as a result of their agitation again, it is none of my business.

<blank>

Sure enough, the kids did it.

One of the kids said he had found a special carriage in the distance and wanted to attack it. The other guys got into the mood and started making a fuss.

<blank>

Are these guys not idiots?

The people who use these specially equipped wagons are former nobles or other powerful people. On the day they attack such a thing, the Knights will surely take notice of them, and they will not be able to survive in this neighborhood.

<blank>

They are kids because they don't understand such common sense! I have no reason to go along with these idiots.

When I told him that I was in a hurry to get to the next destination, he was so scared that he had been in charge all along the way. I told him that I was in a hurry to get on the road.

I don't know, I don't care!

<blank>

These guys are definitely done here.

The alarm within me is going off on the largest scale.

If you stay here, you will definitely not survive! We have to get away from here as fast as we can.

<blank>

I rode my horse through the trees of the forest, more than a kilometer away, but the alarm still hadn't stopped sounding.

<blank>

Is something chasing us? I looked back, but I could not see any sign of being chased.

But the alarm does not stop. On the contrary, we sense an even greater threat.

Disgusting sweat drips down.

<blank>

I can't help but feel as if my own death is imminent.

Unknowingly, his breathing had become ragged.

The sweat running down my back is cold.

It was as if the Grim Reaper was standing right behind me, pressing his palm, the symbol of death, firmly against my back.

<blank>

The horse zigzags even more, as if trying to shake off something it doesn't understand, but the sensation never goes away.

I looked back several times, but of course there was nothing there.

Even though I know there is nothing there, I can't help but check behind me.

<blank>

The sweat that flows so hard gets in my eyes.

The mouth does not even close, and the patient continues to exhale roughly, as if hyperventilating, and the inside of the mouth is dry and the tongue is stuck to the mandible.

It hurts so much behind my ears that my heart continues to beat.

<blank>

It dies! This is death. Definitely die!

<blank>

Jules Nard was convinced that he was about to be shot down by the presence of death, which felt like a huge wall, more overwhelming than anything he had ever experienced in his life.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

But then it abruptly stood down.

<blank>

I remember that I had forgotten how to breathe.

He resumes the natural act of breathing, contracting his lungs at a furious pace, making a hissing, grating sound.

<blank>

With trembling hands, he finally opened the stopper of the water bottle and poured its contents down the back of his throat in one gulp without even taking a breath.

At the same time, my back, soaked with sweat, began to feel the cold.

I want to hurry up and get my horse running and get to safety as quickly as possible.

Such were the only thoughts that occupied Jules Nard's mind at the moment.

<blank>

The Palouse on the way there could never feel safe for Jules Nard.

After changing horses in town, he got water and food and immediately drove his horse all the way to De Kembel without taking a break.

When he arrived in De Kembel, he was suddenly as bloodless and exhausted as if he had aged 10 years.

<blank>

After receiving my reward, I went straight back to my regular lodgings, where I had a good night's sleep until morning, not waking up once until the next day.

<blank>

<blank>

After I got up, I heard that those kids had been caught, but I didn't care. We should consider our lives as a blessing in disguise.

<blank>

It was more than a month ago, but even remembering it now, it still sends a shiver down my spine.

<blank>

Yes, that must have been over a month ago.

<blank>

So why am I now haunted by the same chills I had then?

I knew I shouldn't have taken that job at that time!

<blank>

I know that regretting it now won't help, but there is no doubt in my mind that the choices I made back then have led me to my current situation. My intuition is doing its best to confirm this.

<blank>

Shit! Another dead end!

What the hell, you little shit!

<blank>

It's not that the road is actually blocked.

But beyond that, the future no longer exists, and the warning within me rings out at maximum volume.

<blank>

Damn it! Damn it! Here, too? This one, too?

The road is ....... The road is at ............!

<blank>

I finally realized that there was no way left to escape.

I am convinced that an absolute presence is looming behind me.

<blank>

Breathing up.

Sweat is severely cold.

It's just like that time.

<blank>

I know that there is nothing I can do now but to sit miserably against the dead-end wall of the alley, clattering my back teeth and waiting for my final pronouncement.

<blank>

The street visible from the alley is crowded with people and the bustle is lively as if it were a downtown area at night.

Why is the air so heavy, hard, and dark in this place when the world is just a few meters away, so full of the light that nighttime stores emit?

It is hard to believe that these two are in the same place.

<blank>

It is as if we are looking through a pane of glass into a completely different world.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

With the twinkling lights of the city at his back, this guy appeared from the corner in front of him.

Without any hesitation, he stepped into the alley where we are.

<blank>

The lights of the bar illuminated his back, and his silhouetted figure, as he paced fluidly, could be said to be a ghost of some sort.

<blank>

The reaper stops in front of Jules Nard.

Then, still silhouetted, he put his hands on his hips and slowly opened his mouth.

<blank>

I found it.

<blank>

He looked down at Jules Nard and said only one word in a lovely voice that did not match his presence.
