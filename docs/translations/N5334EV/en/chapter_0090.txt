# Interlude 6 The Lord of the Green Mansion

Chronologically, the story is one chapter later.

"Come on, come here and show me your face."

<blank>

The person, who was sitting in a large, comfortable wheelchair in the center of the room, extended his hand and invited me to join him as he said so.

I was gently pushed by Howard and Sonia, who were standing at the entrance of the room, and stepped forward to the center of the room, where I politely introduced myself.

<blank>

No need for such a formal greeting. Do you know how long I have been waiting for you? Come on, come closer.

<blank>

Before I could finish my greeting, the old woman reached out and took my hand in hers.

<blank>

You can see me, can't you?

I don't see it, okay? But it's made me see much deeper and better than what I can see. Now, tell me more about yourself.

<blank>

It was a large room with numerous soothing furnishings.

The room was located on the top floor of a large four-story house, and the view from the large window was like a painting.

It is the azure horizon stretching far into the distance and the beautiful cityscape of New Knoxport below.

<blank>

Against the backdrop, a gracious old lady sitting in a large wheelchair as the master of the room is smiling kindly.

<blank>

I had heard that his eyes had turned cloudy white and lost their light a long time ago.

However, the palm holding my hand was very warm and strong. I had heard that he was over 80 years old, but there was not the slightest sign of decline in his hands.

<blank>

You'll have to forgive me for sitting down, won't you? My legs have always been weak, and these days I can't even stand up. ...... I'm really sorry I've made her look like such an ungrateful person.

Oh no, Mother ......!"

<blank>

Mama Sonia is shaking her head at the lady's words, saying that is not true.

Yes, this old lady's name is Elizabeth Green.

This is Sonia Mama's mother.

<blank>

This is the former lord's mansion of the former domain of Oceanos, called "Green House", located on a hill overlooking the sea.

<blank>

The former Oceanoos territory, or Oceanoos County, where New Knoxport is located, was the neighboring territory of the Amkham territory when it was a feudal society before democratization.

The land, which partly borders Irosio, has deep ties with Amkam, and the Oceano territory that brings together the ports has long been the country's sea gateway.

<blank>

The appearance of the mansion is of an old masonry style, which gives a sense of the massiveness of the house over time. The steeply pitched dark green slate roof has a soothing warmth.

It looked as if it was quietly watching over the New Knoxport cityscape from above, and one could sense the reason for its popularity with the local people.

<blank>

On this day, I was accompanied by Mom Sonia and Dad Howard to visit the Green House here in New Knoxport to greet my grandmother Elizabeth, .......

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sure ...... you bring back some nostalgic smells. Un, ...... Yoshi yoshi, good boy."

<blank>

Grandmother Elizabeth took me in her arms and gently stroked my head as if she were nursing a small child.

That arm around my back was very, very gentle.

I was told that I would be meeting Sonia Mama's mother, and the tension that had been there all morning seemed to melt away.

Before I knew it, I found myself sinking down and leaving my body to my grandmother.

<blank>

'Yeah, that's right, and that's okay. You're still a little kid, and you can huddle with the adults around you like that, okay?"

<blank>

As I buried my face in my grandmother's body, I was in a deep green forest overflowing with sunlight filtering through the trees, and I could smell a strange and nostalgic smell, like the scent of the sea from far away.

It seems to be similar to an atmosphere that I know from somewhere .......

My grandmother strokes my hair very gently and tenderly as I feel this strange sense of déjà vu.

<blank>

Grandmother's blind eyes may not allow light to pass through them, but I couldn't help but feel that they had a profoundly large receptive power, as if they could capture the surface of the water that shimmers in the depths of the soul, scooping up even the smallest of tiny waves.

It is like being wrapped in a large, gentle palm, which is very comforting.

I felt a sense of relief, as if someone had found me when I was lost, and for some reason, I was so happy that I almost burst into tears.

<blank>

You say, "Oh yeah, ......, I see. My grandson is back, isn't he? ....... Oh, yeah. ...... Sonia, Howard. You're not wrong. This kid is a no-brainer. ......

'...... Ah! Mother! What then?

'Oh, yes. ...... but, you know, never make a mistake, okay? This is the child. The reason of the soul is beyond human understanding. Don't ever think of it in your own way, okay? I say it again and again, this is the child, ...... this is the child."

Yes, ...... yes! I understand!"

<blank>

What are the two of you talking about?

When I looked up and tilted my head in question, she placed her hand on my cheek and spoke to me softly.

<blank>

You don't have to worry about anything. You don't have to worry about anything. You are here because you want to be, because you are needed. That's an indisputable fact, and that's reason enough to be here. Okay? Don't ever forget that, okay?

<blank>

My heart pulses in my chest at Grandmother's words.

I remember a while ago, when I clung to Mama Sonia and cried when she said, 'You can stay here' and 'Let's be a family.

<blank>

I wondered if Grandmother could even see through my emotional turmoil at that moment.

Her words are a powerful affirmation that the warmth of Sonia Mama at that time is as solid as it gets.

<blank>

Gently looking up, I saw that my grandmother was gently overflowing with smiles.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Now the question that remains is: ....... Adler, Adler! Are you out there?"

Yes, Mother, I'm here.

'A long time ago, I think it was about 30 years ago, ......? I thought my two younger brothers, the youngest son of the Hemming guy, had crossed over to Mericle, a continent to the east, no?"

It was a long time ago. ......, I remember that happening."

<blank>

Grandmother's voice was very taut, a change from her previous gentle demeanor, and she called out to the man standing behind Sonia-mama.

The person called Mr. Adler is Grandma Elizabeth's son. In other words, he is Sonia Mama's brother, the current patriarch of the Greene family and head of Oceanoos County.

He was also an old acquaintance of Papa Howard's, and as soon as we met, we shook hands firmly and he was happy to see me again.

The two of them are clearly connected by their mutual recognition of each other and their solid trust.

Seeing her talk to such a person without mercy, I can understand her position in this place.

<blank>

Come to think of it, some months ago a large ship from Mericle was reduced to sea debris before it arrived in our harbor, wasn't it?"

It was four months ago, the day before the storm, Mother. Unfortunately, the ship had several large scratches from the long journey.

Mellow and the others helped you out a lot, didn't they?"

They picked up a lot of people who had been thrown overboard, but a lot of lives were lost. Only a handful made it to land, just one-fifth of the entire crew.

'That was unfortunate. ....... Blessings on the water Akel. ...... So, were there any girls among the survivors?"

Now, what do you think? Do you want me to check?"

Yes, let's have him check it out."

<blank>

It looks like there was a very big maritime accident.

I believe "mellow" refers to an aquatic species, such as mermaids!

I haven't seen them yet, but Mama Sonia told me that there are quite a few mellow people living in this town.

I would have loved to have had the opportunity to meet him!

Can we do a walk around town later with Sonia-mom and Howard-dad or something?

<blank>

....... This child, who lost his parents on the continent, had nowhere else to go, so he boarded a ship from the continent of Mericle to this continent of Veneris in order to go to his parents' homeland.

<blank>

What's wrong? ...... something jumped off the page?

Who is this 'this girl' that grandmother is talking about?

<blank>

The girl had a ship accident that left her with no choice but to die, and although she made it to this continent on her own, she landed in Iroquois. The poor boy lost his memory from the shock of the accident, and while wandering around the Devil's Forest looking for a human settlement, he was finally rescued by Howard.

"...... I see. Then, like that."

I'm counting on you, Adler. The central idiots don't know what's going on beyond the sea without us, and they don't care to know.

<blank>

Unlike her gentle and calm demeanor when she was facing me, she was like a seasoned politician as she delivered one instruction after another in her sharp voice.

She is said to be the "Eye of the Soul," and was once called the "Empress of Oceanos.

Looking at the current exchange, it is easy to imagine that he must be a strong man who has dealt with many political opponents and is a sennen of the sea.

I think it was understandable that I was very nervous when I was first told that I was going to meet such a person!

<blank>

But ......, wait a minute? Are you talking about me now, by any chance? Huh?

I feel like there's an epic story being put together before I know it. ...... Nanikore? Is everything ok?

Is this ...... not a background check or something?

<blank>

Uh, and? ... Huh? Oh, um... Huh?"

Don't worry, you don't have to worry about anything. This kind of outward talk is for adults to do on their own. You can live with Sonia and the others in peace.

<blank>

I was perplexed, but my grandmother smiled kindly at me again.

<blank>

'Now, now, I'm done with all the trouble. Now you can tell me your story, okay? How's Amkam? Is it an easy place to live? Have you made friends?

They are all good people! I have friends!"

<blank>

Immediately after this day, I was officially registered as an adopted daughter of the Cloud family.

It was the middle of the 5 ao month. It was about half a month before the first harvest festival in the area.
