# Interlude 6: The Master of the Green Mansion

Chronologically, this story takes place after Chapter One.

<b>

"Now, come here and show me your face very well."

<b>

The lady said this while extending her hand and beckoning me closer, seated comfortably in a large wheelchair at the center of the room.

I was gently pushed from behind by Papa Howard and Mama Sonia, who were standing at the entrance, and I stepped forward to the center of the room, where I politely introduced myself.

<b>

"You don't need such a formal greeting. Do you know how long I've been waiting for you? Come now, come closer."

<b>

Before I could finish my greeting, the elderly lady said this, reaching out and grasping my hand tightly.

<b>

"Can you... see, then?"

"I can't see, you know? But thanks to that, I’ve come to understand things beyond what is visible much deeper and better. Now, tell me more about yourself?"

<b>

The room was large, furnished with many calming pieces of furniture.

Located on the top floor of a four-story mansion, the room had a large window through which the view outside spread like a painting.

It was the beautiful cityscape of New Knockport, with a blue horizon stretching far away and the lovely streets below.

<b>

Against that backdrop, the elegant elderly lady, seated in the large wheelchair as the master of the room, was simply smiling gently.

<b>

Her eyes were cloudy and had lost their light long ago, as I had heard.

However, the hand that held mine was very warm and strong. I had been told she was over 80 years old, but I felt no trace of frailty from her.

<b>

"Please forgive me for sitting down, okay? I've had weak legs since long ago, and recently I can hardly stand at all... I truly feel sorry for this girl, as she has inherited nothing but such misfortunes from me."

"Not at all, Mother...!"

<b>

Mama Sonia shook her head, saying that was not the case.

Yes, this elderly lady's name is Elizabeth Green.

She is Mama Sonia's mother.

<b>

This place is the "Green Mansion," an old lord's residence of the former Oceanos territory, located on a hill with a view of the sea.

<b>

The old Oceanos territory, where New Knockport is located, was a feudal society before democratization and was adjacent to the Amkam territory.

Part of this land borders Iroshio, and the Oceanos territory, which managed the port, has long been the gateway to the sea for this country.

<b>

The mansion's architecture is in the old stone masonry style, conveying a sense of weightiness accumulated over time. The deep green, steep slate roof exudes a calm warmth.

Its appearance seems to quietly watch over the streets of New Knockport from above, evoking a sense of familiarity among the local people.

<b>

On this day, I visited the Green Mansion in New Knockport to greet this lady... Grandma Elizabeth, accompanied by Mama Sonia and Papa Howard.

<b>

<b>

"…You carry a nostalgic scent with you, don't you? Yes, yes, good child."

<b>

Grandma Elizabeth pulled me close with her outstretched hand and gently patted my head as if soothing a small child.

Her arm wrapped around me was very, very gentle.

As I was told I would meet Mama Sonia's mother, the tension I had felt since morning melted away.

Before I knew it, I found myself leaning into Grandma, as if sinking into her embrace.

<b>

"Yes, that's right. It's okay for you, still young, to lean on the adults around you like that, you know?"

<b>

As I buried my face in Grandma's body, I felt a strange nostalgia, as if I were in a deep green place filled with sunlight filtering through leaves, and I could smell the sea from afar.

It felt like a familiar scent from somewhere... a feeling that the air resembled what I knew.

As I felt this strange déjà vu, Grandma gently stroked my hair with great tenderness.

<b>

Though Grandma's blind eyes may not let in light, I couldn't help but feel that they possessed a deep, profound capacity to capture even the smallest ripples reflecting the surface of a soul's depths.

It felt as if I were enveloped in her gentle, large hands, and it was very comforting.

I felt a sense of relief, as if I had been found after being lost, and for some reason, I was overwhelmed with joy to the point of tears.

<b>

"I see... my grandchild has returned... I see, I see... Sonia, Howard. Your thoughts are not wrong. This child is undoubtedly..."

"…Ah! Mother! Then?!"

"Ah, yes... But you must never be mistaken. This child is this child. The principles of the soul exist in places beyond human understanding. Never think of it in a way that suits your convenience. I will say it again, this child is... this child."

"Yes, ...yes! I understand!"

<b>

What are they talking about?

I looked up, tilting my head in question, and Grandma placed her hand on my cheek, gently speaking to me.

<b>

"You don't need to worry about anything. Do you understand? You are here because you are wanted and desired. That is an undeniable fact, and it is more than enough reason for you to be here. Do you understand? Never forget that, okay?"

<b>

At Grandma's words, my heart thumped deeply.

I recalled the time when Mama Sonia told me, "You can stay here," and "Let's become family," and I clung to her, crying.

<b>

Did Grandma see the turmoil in my heart at that time?

Her words strongly affirmed that the warmth of Mama Sonia at that moment was something very real.

<b>

When I looked up softly, Grandma was overflowing with a gentle smile.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…Now, the remaining issue is... Adler, Adler! Are you there?"

"Yes, Mother, I am here."

"About thirty years ago, I believe... my younger brother, Heming's youngest son, went to the continent of Merikuru to the east, didn't he?"

"That is quite an old story... but I remember something like that."

<b>

Grandma's voice changed from the gentle atmosphere to a very firm tone as she addressed the man standing behind Mama Sonia.

That man, called Adler, is Grandma Elizabeth's son. In other words, he is Mama Sonia's older brother, the current head of the Green family, and the leader of Oceanos County.

He and Papa Howard were old acquaintances, and upon meeting, they exchanged a firm handshake, rejoicing in their reunion.

From their demeanor, it was clear that they recognized each other and were connected by a strong trust.

Seeing Grandma speak to him without reservation gave me insight into her standing here.

<b>

"By the way, a few months ago, a large ship from Merikuru sank before arriving at our port, didn't it?"

"That was four months ago, due to the storm the day before, Mother. Unfortunately, the ship sustained significant damage during its long journey."

"The Merrow helped a lot, didn't they?"

"They rescued quite a few people thrown into the sea, but many lives were lost. Only a handful, just one-fifth of the entire crew, made it to land."

"That was unfortunate... May the blessings of the Water Akeru be with them... So, among the survivors, was there a girl?"

"Well, I wonder? Should I confirm?"

"Yes, let's have it checked just in case."

<b>

It seems there was quite a significant maritime disaster.

I believe "Merrow" refers to a water-dwelling race, like mermaids!

I haven't seen one yet, but Mama Sonia said there are quite a number of Merrow living in this town.

If I have the chance, I would love to meet them!

I wonder if I could explore the town with Mama Sonia and Papa Howard later?

<b>

"…So, this child, who lost her parents on the continent, lost her way and boarded a ship from the Merikuru continent heading to this Venelis continent."

<b>

Huh? ...Did the conversation suddenly take a turn?

Who is this "child" Grandma is talking about?

<b>

"This child, who survived the shipwreck, managed to reach this continent on her own, but she landed in Iroshio. Poor thing, she lost her memory due to the impact of the accident and wandered through the cursed forest searching for human settlements until she was finally rescued by Howard."

"…I see. Then, in that case..."

"Please, Adler. Those fools in the central government wouldn't know a thing about the sea unless they come through us, nor would they care to know."

<b>

The sharp voice of Grandma, issuing commands one after another, was completely different from the gentle, calm atmosphere she had when facing me.

She is said to see through everything and is known by the title "Eye of the Soul." It is said that she was once called the "Empress of Oceanos."

Watching the exchange now, it is easy to imagine that she is indeed a formidable figure who has dealt with many political rivals.

At first, I felt it was only natural to be very nervous about meeting someone like her!

<b>

But... wait a minute? Is this conversation possibly about me? Huh?

It feels like a grand story is being woven, but... what is this? Is it okay?

Will I not be accused of identity fraud...?

<b>

"Uh, um? ...Huh? Ah, um... huh?"

"Don't worry, you don't have to be concerned about anything. Such external matters are for adults to handle. You can live peacefully with Sonia and the others."

<b>

Grandma gave me another gentle smile, reassuring me in my confusion.

<b>

"Now, now, the troublesome matters are over. Why don't you tell me about yourself? How is Amkam? Is it easy to live there? Have you made friends?"

"Ah... y-yes... everyone is really nice! I have friends too!"

<b>

From that day on, I was to be officially registered as the adopted daughter of the Cloud family.

This was an event that took place about half a month before the first harvest festival since I arrived in this land, in the middle of the fifth blue moon.
