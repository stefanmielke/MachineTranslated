「There are currently no confirmed cases of 'travelers'... or rather, 'castaways' like us.」

「I see... I guess that's somewhat reassuring...?」

「Who knows? However, records show that after 'castaways' appear, significant backlash tends to occur within ten years.」

「But there was a 'overflow' when I was there, right?」

「An overflow of that magnitude isn't that rare. It happens every few years.」

「I see...」

「A massive disaster-level overflow, which could be called a 'great calamity,' occurs roughly once every 200 years. The appearance of 'castaways' like us can be seen as a precursor to that.」

「Yeah... so we still can't let our guard down.」

「Don't worry, we're prepared for that. Just focus on what you want to do, Suzu.」

「Thank you, Thor-kun... But when that time comes, I will definitely lend my strength!」

「Yeah, I'm counting on you.」

「Hehe... By the way, did you come up with the name 'castaway'? It sounds so much like you, Thor-kun. Is it a middle schooler thing? Hehe.」

「Middle schooler?!... W-well, it fits the best! I mean, who else would you call someone who can survive for days in a place like that?!」

「Hehehe. That might be true! But I was a bit surprised that Thor-kun had no survival skills at all, you know?」

「W-well, that's to be expected! If you live in the city, there's no way you can handle living creatures! I was the one who was surprised! Why is Suzu so good at survival?!」

「Well, I learned a lot from my brother... and I guess some training from my master...」

「Master? The one from the dojo Suzu attended? What was it again? Aikido or something?」

「Yeah, traditional martial arts, I guess? Since he's a relative, I’ve been going there since I was little.」

「Hmm... But how does traditional martial arts help you gain survival skills?」

「Um... how should I put it... at our dojo, they throw you into the 'mountain' alone for a few days to survive!」

「What?! Seriously?! But... doesn't that sound a lot like that Amukamu thing?」

「Hahaha! It does sound similar! ...But in our case, it’s not just once or twice... ahaha.」

「Is that so? Wow... I think I understand the reason for Suzu's strength now.」

「...I wonder if it's appropriate to say 'strong' when referring to a girl?」

「...Ah, well, but you are strong...」

「Well, whatever! Anyway! If anything happens, make sure to call me!」

「...Yeah, I’ll rely on you. ...Um, sorry.」

「Hehe, it's fine now. It's Thor-kun!」

「...U-um, I'm really sorry.」

「By the way, Thor-kun! You're working on that thing, right?」

「Huh? Ah, I think I've managed to shape it a bit...」

「Really? That's amazing!」

「Thanks to the glass foot, I can now grow both soybeans and wheat. I'm grateful to Suzu for that.」

「I see, that's great! Hehe.」

「I was able to substitute pork bones with boar... and then...」

「Is there still something missing?」

「The broth... I can't get katsuobushi, after all.」

「Ah, that seems pretty impossible.」

「But I found a hot spring while digging in Oceanos...」

「Huh? A hot spring?」

「Yeah, I had a feeling that the geography would allow for a hot spring.」

「So you dug and it came out?」

「...Yeah. So I tried making a ryokan-style rock bath.」

「Hahaha, what are you doing, Thor-kun?」

「But because of that, people were really happy. They decided to help out with various things, so seafood might be possible soon.」

「Wow! That's amazing! I'm so happy for you, Thor-kun! So soon, you might be able to make broth properly?」

「Yeah, I hope I can do it well.」

「You were craving 'negi chashu'! Hehe.」

「Yeah, thanks to everyone, it might just work out.」

「I hope so... It would be nice to eat it someday.」

「Yeah, when that time comes...」

「Someday... someday, let me eat it too. And the hot spring!」

「Sure, someday... I'll guide you.」

「Yeah, someday...」

「Someday...」

「Hmm, before the spirit quality record repository was systematized, the most commonly used magic was spirit magic. However, even so, there were still a fair number of people who used direct magic. But even further back, ritual magic was the norm. Ritual magic could be used by those with almost no magical power, making it the most widely used form of magic in the past. However, compared to modern magic, the catalysts and preparations required for rituals took a lot of effort, and the effects were not as significant as expected. Therefore, in modern times, very few people use it. Well, it's not zero, but... However, the systems left behind by our predecessors are still very much relevant for us learning modern magic. So I hope those interested will actively study it.」

<b>

「Hmm, let's get back to the topic. In both direct magic and spirit magic, an essential element that users must not forget is 'attribute.' I believe you all here can understand that the tendencies vary for each user. Attributes are broadly divided into four: 'earth,' 'water,' 'wind,' and 'fire.' These are known as the four major attributes. Adding 'void' to these gives us the five great elements. Furthermore, there are six higher attributes represented by combinations of the four major attributes: 'wood,' 'metal,' 'sky,' 'sand,' 'mist,' and 'star,' along with an 'yin' attribute that is hidden from all of these. Remember that all twelve attributes are fundamental to the activation of magic.」

<b>

「Hmm, and the essence of attributes is wavelength. When you use magic, a certain wave propagates in the ether band. This is what is called a magical wave or ether wave. The wavelength differs for each individual who generates it. The attributes of the spirit band that are close to the wavelength you generate resonate, and you gain power. It's not that spirits personally favor you and lend their strength, but there are still quite a few who can't understand that in today's society.」

<b>

The teacher, Seiwashi Melchio, who began teaching "Fundamentals of Magic" this week, is a fast-talking blonde elf. I can't help but feel like I've seen him somewhere before.

This teacher talks so fast that everyone is struggling to keep up.

<b>

「Hmm, ultimately, when you get down to it, the most crucial factor in improving magical precision is the caster's ability to imagine. It depends on how clearly and concretely you can envision the activation and how well you can visualize the outcome in your mind. You need the imagination to concretely materialize your mental image and the willpower to shape and maintain it. Remember that a strong, clear will can change oneself, create worlds, and even construct universes.」

<b>

If I'm not mistaken, this teacher is one of the three people I met back then.

Whenever our eyes meet during the lecture, he smiles as if to say, "I understand," which is quite intimidating.

<b>

The dwarf teacher, Morris Balthasar, who taught "Magical Ore Studies" afterward, also looks familiar.

Furthermore, the impressive Professor Nosori Kasubaru, who taught "Magical Biology," is also someone I recognize.

<b>

There's no doubt that these individuals are the three experts who accompanied the Iroshio expedition.

After all, there aren't many people as distinctive as them, right?! I don't think I could mistake them!

Especially since two years ago, on that day when I returned to the village, being surrounded and intensely interrogated by the three experts is a vivid memory.

<b>

How did you use that healing magic? What kind of technique was it?! Where did you learn it?!!

What material was the armor you equipped on that horse? Where did you get it?! How did you process it?!!

What was that summoned creature? What kind of existence is it?! How can you summon it?!!

<b>

I vividly remember being shaken by the shoulders by the three of them.

At that time, Captain Meyer hurriedly intervened to mediate.

After that, I tried to avoid meeting the three of them until the knight order withdrew from the village...

I never expected to reunite in a place like this.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

And, as I feared, after class ended, I was called by the three teachers.

During lunch break, I was told to report to the magic research building at the back of the magic department.

As someone who can no longer escape, I only have a strong sense of foreboding...

<b>

But the magic research building!

What a captivating name for a building in a school that teaches magic, isn't it?!

I can't help but feel a rush of excitement that pushes back even the foreboding!

<b>

Well, still! Waiting for me are those three experts!

The suspicion and dubiousness surrounding them are something I can no longer ignore, right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

And after the morning classes ended, when I headed to the cafeteria for lunch, Colin and Dana were already enjoying tea after their meal.

Usually, after finishing their meal, Dana would immediately get up and say something like, "It's time for spear practice!" and happily fly off somewhere, but for some reason, today she is taking her time. She seems oddly sulky while saying, "I can't help it because it's work." Colin seems to be comforting her, but I wonder what's going on?

<b>

After having lunch, I was seen off by Vivi and headed alone to the magic department on the north side of the school building.

Vivi said, "Be careful and have a good time," which is rare for her, showing concern. Hmm, it seems Vivi is worried in her own way. I thought about how grateful I am for my friend's thoughtfulness as I left the cafeteria and headed to the magic department.

<b>

<b>

The research building was made of stone and was surprisingly large.

Since it was said to have been an old school building, it makes sense that it would be big.

Its rugged and spiky appearance, reminiscent of Gothic-style cathedrals in Europe, is truly majestic but also gives off a creepy vibe.

Hmm, nice! It really exudes the scent of a secret fortress conducting suspicious research! Pass!!

<b>

When I opened the large, heavy entrance door, it creaked loudly, echoing through the building.

As I walked alone down the dimly lit, long corridor, only the sound of my footsteps echoed within. Nice, nice! This feeling! It creates an unnecessary sense of tension!

<b>

Eventually, when I knocked in front of the large door of the designated room, I heard a relaxed voice saying, "You can come in." 

Hmm, I feel like the atmosphere that was there until now has been completely ruined... Is that voice from Professor Nosori?

<b>

Excuse me. As I entered, I found a spacious room that resembled a large salon.

Huh? Surprisingly, the inside is normal?

I had imagined it would be filled with suspicious magical books scattered around, minerals lying everywhere, or bizarre creatures preserved in formaldehyde... but this looks like a well-organized reception room.

<b>

「I clean and tidy up every day!」

<b>

As if reading my thoughts, that voice suddenly came from the side. Huh? Why is Professor Joslan here?

<b>

「It's been a while, Princess Amukamu.」

「It's been a while. The professors seem to be doing well too.」

「We're all doing fine, no problems!」

「Hmm, for now, let's sit and talk. Josline, please get the tea.」

「Ah, yes, yes, I understand!」

「By the way, what brings you, Professor Joslan, to serve like this?」

「Huh? That's because I'm still assisting the professors!」

<b>

Assistant?

I tilted my head slightly.

<b>

While greeting the three experts, Professor Joslan mentioned that she is the assistant to the professors.

Why is Professor Joslan an assistant?

There seems to be a hint of suspicion, but Professor Joslan is indeed teaching us.

Even if they are university professors, is this academy really so short-handed that they need to have a regular teacher as an assistant?

<b>

「Huh? Why do you look so puzzled? I've been assisting Professor Seiwashi for many years now, you know? You know that, right?」

「Huh? ...No, I didn't know.」

<b>

「Hmm, it seems she has no idea that I've been her assistant for a long time.」

「I see, you look like you're hearing it for the first time!」

「You don't remember your assistant at all, do you? Hehehe.」

「Wha?! W-wait a minute! We’ve met in Iroshio and Amukamu village, right? We talked, right?!」

「Hahaha, you really don't remember!」

「Oh no, Professor Joslan is starting to scream... Sorry, I really don't remember at all.」

<b>

「More importantly, did you register with the Adventurers' Guild?」

「D-does it really not matter?!」

「Assistant, let's keep the conversation moving, shall we?」

「Um... yes, I registered the other day, but... what about it?」

<b>

「Then soon, I'll be calling you to help with my mineral tests, so I expect your cooperation!」

「Huh?」

「Hmm, I also need help with magical activation experiments. Naturally, I'll be putting in a request, so keep that in mind.」

「Huh? Wait...」

「Of course, I'll also need hands for capturing and dissecting magical creatures! So I expect your cooperation!」

「Huh? W-what are you talking about, professors?!」

<b>

What are these people saying?! I registered with the guild, but helping these professors seems way too advanced for a newbie who hasn't even reached D rank yet?!

It's not like I could handle a job involving "capture," which comes with risks, right?! No way!

<b>

「B-but how do you know I registered with the Adventurers' Guild?!」

「Well, I asked the student affairs office.」

「Huh?」

「The academy keeps track of when, where, and what kind of work students do with the Adventurers' Guild.」

「Hmm, that's proof of the deep connection between the academy and the Adventurers' Guild. That's why the academy can safely entrust students to the guild.」

「I-I see...」

<b>

I was surprised to hear that and understood.

Well, that must be why I have permission to go out.

For better or worse, it seems I'm doing social studies safely on the academy's terms, right?

Then, all the more reason that dangerous jobs shouldn't be permitted by the academy, right?

<b>

「E-either way, I'm still just a newly E-rank...」

「Ah, that's not a problem!」

「Hmm, you don't need to think too hard about it. Just consider yourself our assistant, and there won't be any issues.」

「Huh? Me... an assistant?」

「W-wait a minute! Am I being fired as an assistant?!」

「So, let's keep quiet for a bit, shall we?!」

「B-but, for a first-year like me to suddenly be an assistant to the professors...」

「Ahhh! You've been waiting patiently for a year and a half! What's a month or two earlier?!!」

「Huh?! Y-yes?!」

「Hmm, the promise has already been made. Now, you just have to fulfill it.」

「W-what promise?!」

「That's why! Let's get you cooperating quickly!!」

「W-wait, what are you trying to make me do?!」

<b>

I was left bewildered by the professors, who began saying incomprehensible things!

<b>

「Professors, wait! You promised not to rush! Remember, only within the range of help that the princess can provide!!」

<b>

At that moment, someone stepped in between me and the professors to protect me.

It was the same person who had brought tea and was now standing in front of the professors.

Seeing me bewildered, they quickly placed the tray with tea on the table and stood in front of the professors.

<b>

「Huh? You are... I feel like I've seen you somewhere...」

「Excuse me! It's been a while, Princess Suzi! Do you remember me? I am Norman Lance, former leader of the 12th Mobile Heavy Knight Brigade, 4th Squad!」

「Ah! You were the spear captain, right?」

「Oh! You remember me! I'm honored!」

<b>

「You remember Norman, but you forgot me?! Why am I the only one forgotten?!」

「That's why I'm telling you to be quiet! Just be a bit more composed!」

「Gah! W-wait! The tea cookies?! W-water! Water!」

<b>

「...Ah, but former?」

「Yes! I am currently on special duty and have left the brigade! I am here to serve as the professors' bodyguard!」

「Huh? E-eh, if it's 'special duty,' isn't it inappropriate to discuss it with someone like me...?」

「No! Princess, you are my protection target!」

「Huh? Me?」

「Yes! Mainly to protect you from the professors' reckless behavior!」

「「「Tch」」」

<b>

As Norman adjusted his glasses and shot a sharp look at the professors, they all turned away in unison and clicked their tongues in a synchronized manner! These professors!!

<b>

「Due to the pact between the knight brigade and Amukamu, I have been entrusted with the important task of protecting you, Princess.」

「The knight brigade and Amukamu...」

<b>

「Hmm, a promise has been made between the academy's director and Amukamu as well.」

「It was Captain Meyer of the knight brigade who insisted that we be allowed to remain in Amukamu for our research!」

「I had no lingering attachment to the university. I took a year to sort things out and have been at the academy for half a year now.」

<b>

According to the professors, the political dealings and academic conferences at the university were truly bothersome.

So the academy intervened, offering to prepare a research facility, suggesting that they wait for my enrollment there.

The professors had no hesitation in coming to the academy since it was convenient for them to stay in Amukamu while having access to a proper university research facility.

In fact, the professors wanted to remain in Amukamu for research even without me. Their experiences in Iroshio were so stimulating for the three experts.

<b>

「Moreover, Amukamu is probably worried about you.」

「Huh? W-worried about me?」

「You were a 'traveler' or was it 'castaway'? ...Well, looking at you now, you seem fine.」

「...?」

<b>

Professor Nosori adjusted his glasses and squinted at me, looking at me as if he were a doctor.

What is it? Did I do something to make them worry?

<b>

「We have no intention of publishing the results we investigate, so you can rest easy!」

「Hmm, this has been discussed with Amukamu and the academy's director. As long as this group is here, there's no need to seek recognition elsewhere.」

「Mormo... Ahem! Ahem! When asking for experimental cooperation, it has been promised.」

<b>

Somehow, it seems I've already made a promise to become the professors' experimental collaborator!

I haven't heard anything about this!!

By the way, it seems that the academy's director is someone who has been helping me without my knowledge?

I wonder what kind of person they are? If I get the chance to meet them, I should express my gratitude.

<b>

「Please allow me the honor of using my body for the sake of the princess!」

<b>

As I was lost in thought, Norman knelt before me, bowing his head as if taking a knight's oath.

In the end, Norman is here to serve as a buffer between me and these reckless professors at the request of the knight brigade and Amukamu.

I am grateful for that. I must not forget to thank Captain Meyer and August as well.

<b>

「Thank you, Norman. I appreciate it.」

<b>

I extended my right hand to Norman, who was kneeling.

He took my hand and kissed the back of it, saying, "It’s an honor," and smiled.

<b>

「Norman is taking a knight's oath?! But I haven't received one yet?!」

「That's why you're being so noisy! Can you be a bit more composed?!」

「Gah! W-wait! The cookies! Water! Water!」

「Assistant, you are quite persistent. You still haven't given up?」

「Hmm, indeed. He’s having fun every day with his girlfriend in spear practice.」

「N-no! She’s the younger sister of a senior who helped me! I just want to be of help, not that I have any romantic feelings!!」

<b>

It seems Professor Seiwashi's words made Norman flustered in his rebuttal. Is his face turning red?

Hmm, I'm a bit curious. Who is the person that makes Norman's face turn red?

Oh, Professor Joslan is back and shouting again!

<b>

As the situation gradually became chaotic and the lunch break was coming to an end, I decided to excuse myself from the scene.

The professors said they would call me again when I reached "D rank."

Hmm, even though Norman will protect me, it still feels a bit scary.

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I returned to the main building, Anna Mary was waiting for me in front of the classroom.

When I asked if something was wrong, she handed me a beautiful envelope, saying it was a delivery.

<b>

「...What is this?」

「An invitation to a tea party for you, my lady.」

「Huh?」

「It is an invitation from Miss Caroline Goldberg, the daughter of the former duke, for the second-year students.」

<b>

Gah! Wait a minute.

I just came from being called by the three professors, and now I'm being summoned again?!

What is this? Is today some kind of "summoning day" or something?!

And the daughter of a former duke?! I have a feeling that another stomach-churning situation is waiting for me, just like this morning!!

<b>

「...Um, do I have to go...?」

<b>

In response to my fearful question, Anna Mary smiled very gently. 

<b>

Thank you for always reading!
