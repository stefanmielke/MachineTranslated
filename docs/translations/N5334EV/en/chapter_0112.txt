There have been no confirmed cases of "travelers" ...... like us, or anyone else "in distress" at this time.

I see ......, is that a relief ...... for that?"

I don't know. But the record shows that within 10 years of the 'distressed' showing up, there has been a major shakeup."

But the overflow happened when I was there, didn't it?"

An 'overflow' of that magnitude is not that unusual," he said. It happens every few years.

I see. ......."

A huge disaster-level overflow, which could be called a 'catastrophe,' occurs about once every 200 years. The appearance of people like us in distress is a harbinger of such a disaster.

Yeah, ......, I guess that means I'm not out of the woods yet."

I'm fine, and I'm prepared for that. Tin can do what he wants to do."

"Thanks, Thor. ....... But I'll be sure to help you out when I do!"

Yeah, I'm counting on it.

I'm not sure if it was Thor who came up with the name "distressed," though, ......? Ummm, it's kind of like Thor, isn't it? It's like Chunyi-ish? Hmmm..."

In the middle?" It's ......, because it's the most chic! In general! Who could survive in a place like that for days on end, except someone who could call it that!"

'Mm-hmm. I guess you're right! But I'm kind of surprised that you, Thor, had no survival skills at all, huh?"

It can't be helped! Usually, city dwellers don't have the skills to handle living creatures! I was the one who was surprised! How could a tin be so strong at survival?

I've learned a lot from my brother. ......? And then I guess I'm going to have to learn from my teacher ......."

'Shihan' at the dojo Tin used to go to? What was it? Aikido or something?"

"Yeah, kobujutsu? I'm related to him, so I've been practicing since I was little."

"Hmmm......... but what makes you think you can learn survival skills through kobudo?"

Let's see, ......, how should I say it, our dojo, go live by yourself for a few days! You'll be thrown into the 'Gozan' with nothing but your body. ......"

What's that? Seriously? But ...... doesn't that look like that thing from Amcam?"

Haha! We may indeed be similar! ...... but in our case it's more than just once or twice. ...... ahaha"

'Really? Wow, ......, I think I know why Tin is so strong."

You know how you say things like "...... strong" to a girl?"

"...... Oh, no, but actually, it's strong. ......"

'Well okay, ......, whatever! Call me properly if you need anything!"

"......Yeah, nice to meet you. ......, I'm sorry."

I'm not going to say it again. It's Mr. Thor!"

...... u, so sorry."

"Oh, by the way, Thor! You're making that thing, right?"

What? Oh, I think I'm starting to get some ...... shape, huh?"

Really? That's great!"

Thanks to Glassfoot, we can now grow soybeans and wheat. I'm grateful to Tin.

I see. That's good to hear, hehe.

I could have substituted the pork bone with a boa ...... and then..."

Am I still missing something?"

The dashi (soup stock) is ......, and I couldn't get dried bonito flakes.

'Yeah, that seems like a quandary, doesn't it?'

But I hit a hot spring in Oceano last time I was there. ......

What about? A hot spring?"

No, I just had a feeling that the topography of the area would have hot springs.

So you dug and it came up?"

...... That's why I made a rock bath that looks like an inn.

"Ha-ha-ha, what are you doing? What are you doing, Thor?"

But it made them very happy," he said. They've agreed to help me with a lot of things, so I think I'll be able to get some seafood eventually.

Heh! That's great! That's great, Thor! So you'll be able to make dashi in earnest soon?"

Yeah, I hope it works out."

He wanted to eat 'green onion chashu', right? Hmmm..."

Yeah, we might be able to work something out thanks to all of you."

I see. ......, yes. I hope you get to eat it someday."

Yes, then ......"

He said, "Someday ......, you'll have to feed me too sometime. And a hot spring too!"

'Yes, I'll show you around ...... sometime.'

Yeah, maybe someday ......"

"Someday ......"

Before the systematization of the spiritual archives, spirit magic was the most widely used. But there were still a few people who used magic directly. Before that time, however, ritual magic was more common. Ritual magic was once the most widely used form of magic because it could be used by those with little or no magical power. However, compared to modern magic, ritual magic requires a lot of preparation and catalysts, and the effects are not as great as expected. Therefore, there are not so many people who use it nowadays. But it is not zero. However, the systems bequeathed by our predecessors can be of great help to those of us who study modern magic. Therefore, those who are interested are encouraged to study it.

<blank>

Let's return to the subject. In both direct magic and spirit magic, the user must not forget about 'attributes'. I am sure that you, who are here now, understand that each user has a different tendency to have different attributes. I think you know that attributes can be roughly divided into four categories: earth, water, wind, and fire. These are the so-called four major attributes. Add "nothingness" to them, and they are called the five elements. Furthermore, there are the upper six attributes of "wood," "gold," "sky," "sand," "fog," and "stars," which are expressed by combining these four major attributes, and an attribute called "yin," which is hidden from all of them. I want you to remember that all 12 of these attributes are at the core of magic.

<blank>

And the essence of an attribute is a wavelength, right? When you use magic, a kind of wave propagates in the etheric zone. This is called a magic wave or etheric wave. The wavelength of this wave is different for each individual who generates it. The attributes of the spirit belt that are close to the wavelength of the wave you generate are in tune with it, and you all gain power. It is not that the spirits are lending you their power because they like you personally, but it seems that there are not a few people in today's society who do not understand this.

<blank>

I think I have seen this fast-talking blonde elf teacher named Seiwashi Melchio, who is teaching the "Fundamentals of Magic" class that started this week.

This teacher talks so fast that everyone struggles to keep up with him.

<blank>

When it comes down to it, the most important factor in improving the accuracy of magic is the ability of the magician to visualize. It all depends on how clearly and concretely you can visualize the magic and how well you can create the result in your mind. The power of imagination and the power of will to formulate and carry through with the image are necessary. Remember that strong and unclouded willpower alone can change you, create the world, and even build the universe.

<blank>

If it is not my imagination, I still think this teacher is one of the three of you at that time.

It's kind of scary how he smiles at me when our eyes meet sometimes between lectures, as if to say, 'You know what I mean.

<blank>

The dwarven teacher after that, Morris Baltasar, who was said to be a teacher of magical mineralogy, was also perfectly familiar to me.

Furthermore, I remember seeing the brilliant anti-sy ...... no, I beg your pardon ...... of Dr. Nosoli Kasbal of Magical Biology afterwards, as I should have.

<blank>

Undoubtedly, these are the three doctors of expertise who accompanied the previous Irosio expedition.

There aren't that many people in the world like this, are there? I don't think it's possible to make a mistake!

After all, it is a vivid memory of that day two years ago, back in the village, when I was surrounded by the three doctors and intensely questioned.

<blank>

How did you use that recovery magic? What kind of art? Where on earth did you learn it!

What was the material used to make that armor you had that horse equipped with? Where did you get it? How did you process it?!

What is that creature you summoned? What kind of being? How can I summon it? !

<blank>

I well remember the three of them grabbing me by the shoulders and shaking me stiffly.

At that time, Mr. Meyer, the battalion commander, hurriedly intervened and interceded.

After that, I had to sneak away from the three of them until the Knights pulled out of the village. ......

I never expected to see him again in a place like this.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And, as I had feared, I was called in by three teachers after class.

He asked me to report to the Magic Research Building, located at the back of the Department of Magic, during my lunch break.

As a person who cannot escape at the earliest opportunity, I have a fierce feeling that I am going to have a bad time. ......

<blank>

The research building of the Department of Magic!

What a charming sounding building to be in a school that teaches magic!

The overflowing romance is uncontrollable, and the excitement that blows up in the air pushes back even the bad premonitions!

<blank>

Well, still! It is those three doctors who are waiting for us!

Isn't it the fastest way to come to a point where even the suspiciousness and stinkiness are intertwined with each other?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After the morning classes were over, I went to the main dining hall to have lunch, where I found Colin and Dana, who had already finished their meal, relaxing and having after-dinner tea.

Usually, Dana would get up from her seat as soon as the meal was over, and then happily fly away, saying something like, "I've got a spear to shoot," but today, for some reason, she is taking her time. He was always standing up and saying, "I've got to go to a spear fight," and then he would happily fly off somewhere. Colin seems to be consoling her, but I wonder what's going on.

<blank>

After lunch, Bibi and the others saw me off and I headed alone to the Department of Magic on the north side of the school building.

Bibi said to me, "Have a safe trip," with a kind of concern that was unusual for her. Hmmm, she was concerned about me in her own way. Thinking how nice it was that my friend was so considerate, I left the cafeteria and headed for the Department of Magic.

<blank>

<blank>

The research building was a stone structure and surprisingly large.

The story goes that it used to be a school building, so maybe it's only natural that it's big.

The rugged and spiky appearance, like a gothic-style temple in Europe, is truly majestic, but it also exudes a sense of mystery and mystery.

Oooh, that's good! How full of the smell of a secret fortress full of dubious research! It passes the test!

<blank>

When the large heavy entrance door is opened, the creaking sound of the door echoes through the building as promised.

Walking alone down the long, dimly lit hallway, my footsteps are the only sounds echoing through the building. I like it, I like it! This feeling! It's a feeling that arouses a sense of urgency for no reason at all!

<blank>

Soon, in front of the large door of the designated room, I knocked with a slight tightening of my heart, and immediately heard a relaxed, tension-free voice saying, "You can come in.

I feel like the atmosphere I've been in has been ruined all at once. ......, is this Dr. Nosoli's voice?

<blank>

Excuse me. I went inside and found a spacious and large salon-like room.

What's that? Surprisingly, it's normal inside.

I imagined more suspicious grimoires scattered about, minerals lying here and there, formalin-pickled objects of strange creatures lined up in rows, or something like that .......... I was picturing something like that.... This is a normal, well-organized parlor.

<blank>

"Because I clean and tidy up every day!

<blank>

As if reading my thoughts, such a voice came from the side. What is that? Why is Dr. Josran here?

<blank>

"Long time no see, Princess of AMCAM."

It has been a long time. You too, teachers, have not changed at all.

We're both fine, no problem! No problem."

"Well, why don't we sit down and talk about it for now? Jocelyne, can I have a cup of tea, please?

"Yes, yes, yes, I know.

What in the world is it that has Dr. Joslun doing this kind of serving work here?"

What? Is it because I'm still... working... as... an assistant... to... the... teachers...?

<blank>

Assistant?

I can't help but tilt my head.

<blank>

As I was greeting the three doctors, Dr. Josran came to me and said he was his assistant.

Why is Dr. Joslan his assistant?

Despite his subtle suspicions, Mr. Josran is our teacher.

Even though he is a doctor of a university, is this academy so understaffed that it would allow such an ordinary teacher to work as an assistant?

<blank>

Huh? Huh? Why are you making a strange face? I've been an assistant to Mr. Seiwashi for many, many years now. You know that, don't you?

Yes?" ...... No, I don't know, sir?"

<blank>

'Hmmm, that one, she's totally unaware that you've been my assistant for some time.

I see, you look like you've never heard of it before!"

"I bet you don't remember anything about your assistant, do you?

What? Wait a minute.... We've seen each other in the back of Irosio and in the village of Amkham, haven't we? We've talked to each other, haven't we?

"Wahaha, that's a face I don't remember!"

I'm sure that's the way to treat your assistant! Hee hee hee!

<blank>

Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo? and Dr. Josran started screaming ....... I'm sorry, I really don't remember any of it.

<blank>

I'm not interested in that! You're registered with the Adventurers' Guild, aren't you?"

Do you want to be treated as "Do..! Do you want me to treat you any way?

I think I'm going to have to shut up for a minute because you're going to get in the way of the conversation."

"Well, ......, yes, I did register the other day, but ...... what?"

<blank>

If so, I'll be appointing you to help me with my mineral testing soon, so please do me a favor!"

What about?"

I'll need help with the magic activation experiment. Naturally, I'll put in an appointment, so please be prepared for that."

What? Huh? Hey, ......"

I will also need help in capturing and dismantling magic refined creatures! I'll be counting on you.

What? What? What are you saying, teachers?

<blank>

What are these people talking about? I've registered with the union, but isn't the level of work too high, like helping these teachers?

It's not a job for a rookie who hasn't even made the "D" class, is it?

If it was a waitress at Mr. Seamach's place, the union would not agree to "capture" or anything that involves danger, right? No matter how you think about it!

<blank>

How did you know that I had registered with the Adventurers' Guild, anyway?

That's because the student affairs office told me, didn't they?"

Yes?"

The school keeps track of where, when, and for how long students work or plan to work in the Adventurers' Guild.

That's why the school can trust the students to the union. That's why the school can entrust its students to the union with peace of mind.

That's what I mean when I say ......."

<blank>

I was surprised and convinced by what I heard.

Well, that's why I have permission to go out, isn't it?

For better or worse, they are working and studying social studies without risking themselves in the hands of the school, right?

If that were the case, wouldn't the school not allow work that is potentially dangerous?

<blank>

Either way, I've only just reached the rank of E. ......

Ah, I thought those things didn't matter!"

You don't have to think too hard about it, do you? You don't have to think about it too hard, do you?

What? I'm ...... assistant, huh?"

I'll be right back! Please wait! I'm... my... assistant... kubi?

So let's just shut up for a minute, shall we?

"So, but as a new first-year student, I suddenly find myself being called a teacher's assistant. ......

We've been waiting a year and a half for this! What do you care if I'm a month or two early now?

Yes? Yes?

I've already made you a promise. All we need now is for you to fulfill it.

What are you promising me?

That's why! I'm going to need your help!

What the hell are you trying to do to me?

<blank>

The teachers started to say something incomprehensible, and my eyeballs went round and round!

<blank>

Please wait, teachers! You promised not to be in a hurry! Remember, we are only trying to help you as much as you can help us!

<blank>

Then, as if to protect me, there was a person who inserted himself between me and the teachers.

He is the one who made the tea and brought it to us instead of Dr. Josran, who was sitting on the ground, not making the tea he asked for.

When he saw me rolling my eyes, he quickly put the tray with the tea on the table and stood in front of the teachers.

<blank>

"Oh, that? I'm sure you're somewhere ...... too."

I apologize for the inconvenience! It's been a while, Princess Susie! Do you remember me? I am Norman Lance, former leader of Team 4 of the 12th Mobile Heavy Knights!

Oh," he said, "I believe you are the captain of the spear! Captain of the spear, I believe, wasn't it?"

Oh, you remember yourself! You remember me? I am honored!

<blank>

"You remember Mr. Norman...! Do you remember Mr. Norman? And yet..! I am the only one who has been forgotten!

I told you to be quiet!

"Mooo! Oh, tea snack - cookies? Moga! Moisture! Moisture! Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

"...... Oh, but ex?"

I am now on special duty and away from the group! I am currently away from the group on a special assignment! I am now here to escort the teachers!"

What? Well, if it's "Special Affairs," you can tell me, an outsider, at ......."

No. The princess is my escort! The Princess is the subject of her own escort!"

What about? I am, huh? What?

Yes, sir! Mainly to protect the princess from the outbursts of these teachers!"

""Tsk.""

<blank>

Mr. Norman looked at the teachers with his glasses shining, and they all turned their heads to the side and clicked their tongues as if they were in sync! Mr. Norman looked at the teachers with his glasses shining, and they all turned their heads to the side and clucked their tongues as if they were in unison! These teachers!

<blank>

I have been asked to play a major role in protecting the princess, in accordance with the pact between the Knights and Amcam.

The Knights and Amcam's ......"

<blank>

'Hmmm, because promises have been made between the school's chancellor and Amcam as well.

In the first place, it was Captain Meyer of the Order who dragged us to Dekenbel when we insisted that he let us stay and study in Amkamu!

I had no desire to go to college in the first place," he said. I spent a year getting my affairs in order, and I've been at the school for six months now.

<blank>

According to the professors, the academic conferences and political dealings among professors at the university were really bothersome.

The school then intervened and offered to prepare a laboratory for me, so why don't you wait for me to enroll here? The school then suggested that I should wait here for admission to the school.

The teachers had no hesitation in coming to the school because it was not too inconvenient to go to AMCAM and they could use the full-scale university research facilities.

In fact, the doctors wanted to stay and do research at AMCAM even without me. It seems that the experience at Irosio was that stimulating for the three doctors.

<blank>

And, Amkam must be worried about you, too.

What? I'm ......, huh?"

"Were you a 'traveler' or a ...... 'distressed person'? ............ Well, from what I can see of you now, you don't seem to have anything to worry about.

"......?"

<blank>

Dr. Nosoli put his glasses back on, narrowed his eyes somewhat, and looked at me as if he were a doctor.

What is it? Did I do something to worry you?

<blank>

We have no intention of publishing our findings anywhere, so don't worry about that!

I've already discussed this with AMCAM and the school's chairman. "I've already discussed this with AMCAM and the school's chairman, and it's enough to make an announcement with this group. We don't need to get approval from anyone.

"Mormo ...... Gehn, gehn! I've promised to ask you to be my experimental collaborator.

<blank>

It seems that before I knew it, I had already made a promise to become an experimental collaborator of the teachers!

I haven't heard anything about that at all!

But is the school's chairman taking care of me in some way I don't know about?

What kind of person is he? If I have a chance to meet him, I should express my gratitude.

<blank>

Please allow me the honor of using this body for the Princess."

<blank>

While I was lost in such thoughts, Mr. Norman was kneeling on one knee with his head hanging down in front of me as if he were taking a knight's oath.

After all, Master Norman is here at the request of the Knights and AMCAM to act as a bulwark between me and these teachers who seem to be running amok.

It is a gratifying story. I should not forget to thank Mr. Meyer and Mr. August as well.

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Norman. It's a pleasure to meet you, sir."

<blank>

I held out my right hand to Norman, who kneeled down.

Norman took my hand, put his lips on the back of it, and said, "I am honored," and smiled.

<blank>

"Norman-sama's knight's oath? I haven't even had him do it for me yet...!

So you're so noisy! You should be a little quieter!

Mogarooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Again, alsoーーーcookieーーmogarー! Soo, moistureーー! Moggahhhhh!"

You're also a very persistent person, aren't you, assistant? You haven't given up yet, have you?"

"Hmmm, not at all. He's having fun with his crazy girlfriend every day, standing on his spear."

'Yes, no! She is the sister of a senior who has been a great help to me! I just want to help her in any way I can, but never with such flirtatious feelings!

<blank>

Mr. Norman is kind of upset and is arguing against Dr. Seiwashi's words. Isn't his face getting red too?

Ho-ho-ho, I'm a little curious, aren't you? I wonder what kind of person Mr. Norman is blushing for?

Oh, Dr. Joslan is back again, and he's yelling something.

<blank>

The place gradually became more and more chaotic, and my lunch break was running out, so I had to leave the place for the time being.

The teachers said they would call on me again when I reached the 'D' rank.

Hmmm...even though Mr. Norman is protecting me, I still feel a bit intimidated.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I returned to the main school building, AnnaMarie was waiting for my return in front of the classroom.

Is something wrong? I asked, and he handed me a beautiful envelope with a delivery.

<blank>

"...... this?"

"Dear Miss, this is an invitation to a tea party."

What about?"

"You have an invitation from the former Duchess Caroline Goldberg, a sophomore."

<blank>

Gah! Wait a minute!

I just came from a call by three doctors, and you mean another call?

What is this? Is today "Calling Day" or something like that?

And a former duchess? I can't help but have a feeling that a stomach-churning development like this morning is waiting for me!

<blank>

"...... uh, no ...... if I don't answer?"

<blank>

In response to my fearful question, AnnaMarie smiled at me in a very, very kind way.

Thank you for reading!
