# 75 The Immortal Soldiers of Irosio

The atmosphere was torn apart and the earth trembled.

The sword speed of the technique unleashed by Howard was accompanied by a sound piercing impact, unleashing the enormous amount of magical power that cloaked it.

The released magic power, with its high pressure velocity, scraped, gouged, and obliterated everything in its path from one end to the other.

<blank>

Kyle and Tony, who had been watching the hours-long battle between Howard and the vampire, held their hands on the ground, nearly blown away in the aftermath of the destructive force of the shot, and endured the blinding flash.

<blank>

Kyle and the others who were present understood that it was a blow that was filled with powerful magical power.

But its power was far beyond what they knew.

<blank>

Trees in the line of fire where the attack was launched have been severely gouged and reaped. Many of the trees have disappeared cleanly from the roots.

This destructive power far surpasses the "Great Flaming Stream" released by that black-robed vampire last night.

Kyle knew then that the words used to describe Howard were neither metaphors nor exaggerations.

This man can defeat even a dragon single-handedly, can't he?　　There is no way that anything can be defeated with this. Kyle and Tony silently thought so as they watched the scene unfold before them.

<blank>

Howard, at the center of the scene, slowly lowered his sword as if to release his zanshin.

In front of Howard, his lower body, wrapped in a black, ankle-length, loose-fitting lower body robe, was frozen on the ground in a posture as if about to step in.

The upper half of his body has disappeared cleanly, with a smoky white smoke rising from the navel area.

He received that blow to the chest. This was a natural consequence.

<blank>

Soon a huge sword came spinning down to the ground from above, making a wind-swept sound.

The sword, with its blood-red blade, split through the black rocks of the earth and thrust itself at the feet of its owner.

<blank>

Howard kneeled down on the spot as if he had seen the sword thrust into the ground.

<blank>

Sir Cloud!

<blank>

Seeing Howard, Kyle raised his voice.

On closer inspection, Howard's leather armor was torn here and there, and he was also bleeding from everywhere.

There is hardly any blood on his face.

This is what it means to have wounds all over your body.

Without a doubt, this was a full-body blow.

<blank>

The fact that Howard, with his overwhelming strength, had been cornered to such a degree shows how much of a threat the enemy was ....... Kyle and his team were once again confronted with this.

<blank>

Howard's body, which had been resting on the black great sword that he had thrust into the ground, shook as if he were clinging to it.

When they saw this, they sat up in a hurry to go to Howard.

We cannot leave this person as he is.

Fortunately, the professors in the trenches are now treating the wounded.

Conrad and Gilbert, who were brought in earlier, should now be receiving treatment.

<blank>

Now that we have eliminated the biggest threat, it is now our duty to hurry up and take Howard to the trenches and help this hero!

Kyle and Tony nodded to each other, confirming that their intentions were the same.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Just as they were about to step out to go to Howard, ----

They were struck by a fearless presence that made them cower.

<blank>

It even gives the illusion that the atmosphere has been dyed black.

The miasma was so thick that you could almost feel it if you touched it.

<blank>

The source of the miasma is .......

There is no mistaking it. It is from the thing that is only half its body.

Above the black lower garment, on the upper part of the body that should have been emitting white smoke, the black, thick miasma gathers and clumps together.

<blank>

They could not even draw their swords and take a stance, and could only watch with bated breath.

<blank>

As if we were being shown a rewinding image, the black smoke-like miasma swirls and clumps together to form a human form.

It quickly formed the shape of Halbert East, and immediately looked down at Howard, who was kneeling in front of him as if nothing had happened.

<blank>

"Kuha! You're so strong! Ah? Iron Demon God! Kuhaha! Definitely stronger than me! Kuhahahahaha!

<blank>

Halbert East said the words while dropping a cold glare at Howard.

Then, he put his hand on his weapon "Disappear Bringer" standing in front of him, pulled it out of the earth, and carried it on his shoulder.

<blank>

But this time, you're dealing with the wrong guy, huh? Eh? Kuhahahahahaha!

<blank>

Halbert moved the assassin's sword in his hand up and down, tapping it on his shoulder as if to show it off to Howard.

<blank>

It's amazing that you can move even though you've been gouged so badly by the Disappear Bringer, isn't it? Huh? It's the Iron Demon God! Kuhahahaha!

"......gu......nuh."

Oops, grow up, old man! Grandpa!

<blank>

Howard clutched his own sword against the ground, and as he tried to raise his body up, a deadly sword was mercilessly thrown down at his shoulder.

<blank>

Goooooooooooo!"

You're finished! Sleep there!"

<blank>

Howard was hit to the ground with a large gouge from his shoulder to his back by a deadly sword, spewing a large amount of blood.

Kyle and Tony tried to run to Howard as quickly as they could, but the vampire's blood-colored eyes made it impossible for them to move.

Howard grunts and still tries to raise his arms to get up, but his body doesn't seem to be getting up.

<blank>

Then, the shadow at the vampire's feet, looking down at Howard coldly, suddenly widened.

Three more shadows rise from the spreading shadows.

One is brown with black hair. One has white skin and golden blonde hair. One is a shadow with pale blue skin and silvery white hair.

<blank>

One of the shadows, a pale blue-skinned marina, moved as if gliding across the ground and covered Howard's prone back.

He then thrust his five fingernails into Howard's back like blades.

<blank>

A dull, heavy thud, a claw bites into the flesh of his back, Howard lets out a muffled grunt, and his body bounces dully.

<blank>

Marina, don't kill him!"

<blank>

Halbert stopped Marina, who was still trying to thrust her claws into the ground, with a cry.

<blank>

"Ha, Mr. Hulbert. ......"

<blank>

Marina, who had stopped moving suddenly at the sound of Halbert's voice, raised her eyebrows and asked Halbert why with a sad expression on her face.

<blank>

But first, you must gather your men.

<blank>

Halbert directed his words not only to Marina, but also to Elektra and Joel.

Understanding that this was a command from the Lord, the two kneeled down on the spot.

<blank>

The fun is over. Fill this place with soldiers today. Tomorrow we will leave here with all our men!"

<blank>

When Halbert stepped toward the fallen Howard, Marina, who was on top of Howard, immediately got down on her knees.

<blank>

Besides, this thing will only last a couple of hours at most! We won't last until noon, Kuha! By then, I want every last one of you in here! Kill them all! Let's show him how it's done!

<blank>

Howard, lying on the ground, stomps his head on the ground, while Halbert sneers at him.

<blank>

"After you kill every last one of them, go to ...... and kill this guy yourselves at the end. You can do whatever you want, okay? Kuha! Kuhahahahaha!

"Dear Mr. Hulbert, ....... Thank you!"

<blank>

Marina, who hung her head deeply to Halbert in a gesture of gratitude, looked up and licked off the blood dripping from her fingernails with her long, outstretched tongue, then looked down at Howard at her feet with narrowed eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The Order is more than ten thousand souls, living and dead.

<blank>

Halbert looks to the black rocks behind him as he re-carries the "Disappear Bringer".

<blank>

As soon as the army is assembled, we will leave the forest and reap what we can. I'll be playing with the souvenirs you brought until ...... we're all together. Call me when you are ready.

<blank>

As he said this, Halbert turned himself into a miasma of miasma, swirled black and disappeared instantly from the scene.

<blank>

<blank>

As soon as Halbert disappeared, Electra, dressed in a black nightdress, stood up, her golden blonde hair shimmering.

<blank>

"You have my permission, ....... And the gentleman you are looking for is right in front of you! Oh, I'm so happy ! I'm so happy ......! Come on! Have your last moment with me! And let me die inside you!

<blank>

As the shadows spread, Elektra's black dress enveloped her, instantly closing the distance between her and Kyle, and the black shadows overtook him.

<blank>

What? Kuh!"

<blank>

Elektra, her own eyes lighting up like coals, had sharp fangs at Kyle's throat.

Kyle, who had been almost unable to move due to the glare of Halbert's eyes, was helplessly captured by Elektra and taken away among the trees where there was no sunlight.

After the huge shadow glides away, a cowering woman's sneer echoes through the forest and disappears into the depths.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to have some fun too! Yikes!

<blank>

Joel, his beautiful face contorted so much that the corners of his mouth turned up, kicking the ground and sending dirt clods flying, still disappears from the scene.

But the next moment, Joel was in front of Tony.

<blank>

Tony's eyes widened when Joel suddenly appeared in front of him, but he was barely able to adjust his shield to the attack of a huge machete-like sword that was coming from below.

However, the impact was too much to take, and Tony was blown backward with a violent metallic sound echoing through the area.

<blank>

Ugh! Kuuuh!"

"Kihihi! What happened? Cut back and you too make fun of me! Kihihihi!

<blank>

Tony was finally beginning to break free of Halbert's spell, but Joel's fierce barrage of blows had him on the defensive.

Tony was pushed and blown away by Joel's attack and pushed straight into the woods.

<blank>

<blank>

...... Oh, no wonder, you two!"

<blank>

Marina, a pale blue-skinned woman, exhaled as if to say, "I'm in trouble," with her hands on her hips as she looked toward the depths of the forest where they had disappeared.

The wounds Howard inflicted on his body have vanished without a trace, but most of the clothes he wears are shredded, and he is barely clad in the remnants of his garments.

Her hair was also untied, and her long silvery white hair swayed in the wind, clinging to her pale blue naked body in a caressing manner.

<blank>

"You told me to put the troops together. ...... But you have to clean up first."

<blank>

Marina cowered again and chuckled.

He let his hands linger, and the chains hanging from the restraints on his arms crawled on the ground.

<blank>

...... Now, you can't see anything either, sleeping here, can you?"

<blank>

The chain extending from Marina's arm rippled and stretched vigorously toward Howard.

As it was, the chains wrapped messily around Howard's body, dragging him roughly along with them.

<blank>

Holla! I'll take you to your friends! There you'll be the last one to be alone, and you'll be the last one to be alone, so just be quiet and look around! Uh-huh, ha-huh! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

<blank>

Howard's body is pulled into chains, bouncing off the earth and scraping the ground.

Marina's voice mocked it, and it was heard through the trees.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Sir Cloud?

<blank>

I was shocked at the sight of the abandoned figure, and even though I was the one in charge of the knighthood, I could not hide my upset and shouted out.

He then rushed to the figure, which was lying on the ground helplessly.

No doubt, this is Sir Cloud himself.

What a figure that strong man has become! What in the world happened outside?

<blank>

The sight is one word: gruesome.

The armor he wears is cut everywhere, he has many wounds and is bleeding badly.

His face was also scarred as if he had been dragged, and there was hardly any blood on his face.

It was clear that he needed treatment as soon as possible.

<blank>

<blank>

▽▲▽▽▽▽▽▽▽

<blank>

<blank>

Shortly before now, the flow of undead rushing toward us changed.

<blank>

So far, they had been attacking in waves, but there were pauses in between, like a breather.

But here came the pressure to crush them all at once.

<blank>

<blank>

The lower undead, including skeletons and zombies, which were once thought to have been wiped out, including the higher species that had appeared before dawn, were flooding back in and coming together.

It was the middle of the day, but the undead showed no sign of slowing down.

<blank>

This is no doubt related to the fearless presence that appeared at sunrise.

<blank>

Immediately after that, Kyle and Tony came to transport the deeply wounded Conrad and Gilbert, but they left this trench immediately without reporting what had happened, saying that they were going to Sir Cloud, who was still fighting.

<blank>

At this time, with the help of the three doctors, he was able to use his healing powers to restore many of the injured to physical health.

The undead raids had thinned, and the returning logistics forces were able to reinforce the walls around the trenches.

This healing has saved many lives. I cannot thank the doctors enough.

Besides, the extra manpower allowed us to rebuild the wall, so we could give the soliders a break.

I was most thankful that they were able to get some rest after supporting the front line all night.

<blank>

However, something was wrong with the wounds of Lord Conrad and Gilbert, who were brought in, said the half-elf woman who was treating them.

No matter how much healing magic I applied, the wounds would not close. ...... Even when the wound was finally sealed, it would open and bleed immediately.

The bleeding was now barely stopped by holding him down with a cloth and wrapping a bandage tightly to stop the bleeding.

<blank>

After about three hours of regrouping, the trench was hit by vibrations of the atmosphere and earth that felt as if they were echoing in my heart, flashes of light that scorched the sky, and shivers of magical power that made my skin crawl.

It was clearly the impact of a huge magical power being wielded.

Everyone was in a state of shock, but inside the walls, there was no way to see what was going on outside.

I was discussing with Cornell whether we should send out scouts to check on the situation when a huge army of undead once again swept into the trench, filling the ground to overflowing.

<blank>

In order to welcome Kyle and his family, who had not yet returned, the gap on the north side, which was only partially open, was also sealed and closed with an earth wall.

<blank>

The wall was once again built to cover an area about 5 meters high and 20 meters in diameter.

However, the effect of the "holy artifact" that Lisa and the others had created on the wall last night was largely lost when it was burned by the vampire's magic, and the newly created wall, of course, had no such effect.

<blank>

The walls are eroded by the onrushing undead, and the undead spill out through the gaps.

It's fine as long as they are sporadically taking out the undead that have entered the walls, but it's only a matter of time before the walls are breached in a big way.

<blank>

Just as this sense of crisis was growing, something was thrown in from outside the wall.

It was as if it had been carelessly dumped over the wall.

<blank>

That was Sir Cloud.

<blank>

At that time, there was a report of a creepy female laugh echoing from behind the wall. Perhaps it was a vampire.

<blank>

I asked the doctors to treat Sir Cloud as soon as possible, but they said that his wounds were not healed as well as those of Sir Conrad and Sir Gilbert.

Still, he asks them to do everything they can.

<blank>

And the pressure of the undead increased quickly.

They fall one after another from the top of the wall.

The logistics unit scrambles to repair the missing walls, but cannot keep up.

Even though the undead that entered the area were all low-ranking, their numbers increased with each passing hour.

Finally, they are coming to crush us in earnest.

<blank>

Soon the Knights alone could no longer cope with the situation, and finally noncombatants began to suffer casualties as well.

It may be time to make up one's mind.

Only non-combatants ......, or at least civilians, need to make their way to survive at all costs.

He called Fred and instructed him to complete the shelter that he had him work on in case of emergency.

Shelter" is a magical procedure for emergency evacuation that creates a space surrounded by thick walls in the ground and allows evacuees to lie dormant in a state of suspended animation.

At least three doctors and their female assistants. And Mr. Connor Clark, a civilian officer, five of whom must be allowed to survive.

Unfortunately, of the three civilian officials, one was the first to be attacked, and the second sunk into the undead just a short time ago.

We cannot allow any more sacrifices to be made at any cost.

<blank>

Just as the five were about to evacuate, the top of the wall was severely damaged, and an avalanche of undead came crashing in, in greater numbers than ever before.

Immediately, he instructs Cornell and the other soliders to form a central wall.

We must protect them at all costs until the five doctors and the others are evacuated inside the shelter.

<blank>

But the wear and tear on the knights is also considerable.

Everyone should have a small amount of "magic storage device" left.

Many will have used up their "magic storage chassis" as well.

<blank>

As if to mock them, the waves of undead gain momentum.

Can we ever stop its momentum, like a great wave?

<blank>

Just when I was feeling prepared, a shock like a gust of wind ran through the walls.

Like dead leaves being whipped up by a violent wind, the undead are blown away, becoming particles of light and disappearing.

<blank>

What in the world happened?

To me, it felt as if a glowing ripple pierced the south wall and spread out as an impact.

Without a moment's pause for dismay, I knew the shock had spread again.

Now from above.

A glowing ripple spread from the sky above to the north.

The impact of the current shock has blown away most of the undead that were swarming on the north side.

<blank>

I looked up and there was a shadow of something there.

Horses? Horses flying?

<blank>

And there is another shadow that separates us from it.

<blank>

Against the light that dances as if it were winding, a shadow of a person emerges.

............ Is that an angel ......?

<blank>

<blank>

And that soaring salvation called out in a high voice.

<blank>

Howard Dad!
