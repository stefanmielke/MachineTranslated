# Episode 75: The Immortal Army of Iroshio

The atmosphere was torn apart, and the ground trembled.

The speed of the sword technique unleashed by Howard was accompanied by a shock that broke the sound barrier, releasing a vast amount of magical power.

The unleashed magical power flowed at high pressure, erasing, gouging, and obliterating everything in its path.

<b>

Kyle and Tony, who had been watching the battle between Howard and the vampire for several hours, knelt on the ground, struggling to hold their bodies steady against the shockwave of destruction while enduring the dazzling flash of light.

<b>

It was clear to Kyle and the others present that it was a strike imbued with immense magical power.

However, its power far exceeded their understanding of common sense.

<b>

The trees in the line of fire of the attack were deeply gouged and toppled. There were not a few trees that had completely vanished from their roots.

This destructive force far surpassed the "Great Flame Flow" unleashed by that black-clad vampire last night.

"Not even ashes remain..." The words used to describe Howard were not metaphors or exaggerations, and at that moment, Kyle came to realize this.

Could this person single-handedly defeat even a dragon? There should be nothing that could withstand this. Observing the scene before them, Kyle and Tony quietly thought so.

<b>

At the center of that scene, Howard slowly lowered his sword as if releasing his residual thoughts.

In front of Howard stood a figure clad in loose lower garments that reached down to the ankles, poised as if about to step forward, firmly planted on the ground.

The upper body was emitting a smoldering white smoke from around the navel, completely vanishing.

He had taken that strike to his chest. This was the natural consequence.

<b>

Soon after, a massive sword fell from above, cutting through the wind as it spun.

The ominous, blood-red blade of the wicked sword cleaved through the black rock of the earth and lodged itself at the feet of its owner.

<b>

As if to confirm that the sword had struck the ground, Howard immediately knelt down.

<b>

"Lord Cloud!!"

<b>

Kyle called out upon seeing Howard.

Upon closer inspection, Howard's leather armor was slashed in various places, and blood was seeping from numerous wounds.

His face was almost devoid of color.

This was what it meant to be in a state of complete exhaustion.

There was no doubt that this was a strike delivered with all his might.

<b>

The fact that Howard, possessing such overwhelming strength, had been pushed to this extent made Kyle and the others acutely aware of the threat posed by the enemy.

<b>

Howard's body, which had been leaning against the black great sword embedded in the ground, swayed unsteadily.

Seeing this, the two hurriedly stood up to approach Howard.

They could not leave this person as he was.

Although there were no holy knights present, fortunately, the professors were treating the injured in the trenches.

Conrad and Gilberto, who had been transported earlier, should also be receiving treatment now.

<b>

Now, having eliminated the greatest threat, it was our duty to quickly take Howard to the trenches and assist this hero!

Kyle and Tony nodded to each other, confirming that their intentions were aligned.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Just as the two were about to step toward Howard――――

They were suddenly struck by a horrifying presence that made their entire bodies freeze.

<b>

It felt as if the atmosphere had been dyed black.

The miasma was so thick that it seemed tangible.

<b>

The source of that miasma was...

There was no mistaking it. It came from the half-vanished figure.

The upper body, which had been emitting white smoke above the black lower garments, was now gathering and solidifying into a dense, black miasma.

<b>

The two could only stand there, unable to draw their swords or take a stance, literally holding their breath and watching.

<b>

It was as if they were being shown a reversed video, as the black smoke-like miasma swirled and formed a human shape.

In an instant, it took the form of Halbert East, who then immediately cast his gaze down at Howard, who was kneeling before him as if nothing had happened.

<b>

"Kuha! You're strong, aren't you?! Huh?! Iron Demon God! Kuha! No doubt you're stronger than me!! Kuha ha ha ha!!"

<b>

Halbert East spoke, casting a cold glance at Howard.

Then, he placed his hand on his weapon, the "Despair Bringer," and slowly pulled it from the ground, resting it on his shoulder.

<b>

"But this time, you picked the wrong opponent, huh? Kuha ha ha ha ha!"

<b>

Halbert, as if to show off, tapped the wicked sword he held up and down on his shoulder.

<b>

"To be able to move after being gouged like this by the 'Despair Bringer' is astonishing, huh? Iron Demon God! Kuha ha ha!"

"…Guh…nngh."

"Whoa, stay still! Old man!!"

<b>

The wicked sword was mercilessly brought down toward Howard, who was clinging to his sword embedded in the ground, trying to muster his strength.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

"You’re done for! Just lie there!"

<b>

As the wicked sword gouged deeply from Howard's shoulder to his back, he was slammed to the ground, spewing a large amount of blood.

Kyle and Tony instinctively tried to rush to Howard, but they were paralyzed, illuminated by the vampire's blood-colored gaze, unable to move.

Howard groaned, still trying to rise, but his body showed no signs of getting up.

<b>

Then, the shadow at the feet of the vampire, who looked down coldly at Howard, suddenly expanded greatly.

From that expanding shadow, three more shadows rose.

One was brown-skinned with black hair. One was pale-skinned with golden blonde hair. One had light blue skin and silver hair.

<b>

One of those shadows, Marina with light blue skin, glided toward Howard, who was lying on the ground, and covered his back.

With her eyes glowing red like embers, she let out a shrill scream and plunged her claw-like fingers into Howard's back.

<b>

With a dull, heavy sound, her claws sank into the flesh of his back, causing Howard to emit a muffled groan as his body jerked violently.

<b>

"Marina, don't kill him!"

<b>

Halbert shouted, stopping Marina, who was still trying to drive her claws into Howard.

<b>

"H-Halbert-sama…"

<b>

Marina, who halted her movements at Halbert's voice, furrowed her brows and asked Halbert, looking sad for some reason.

<b>

"More importantly, you all need to gather the soldiers first."

<b>

Halbert addressed not only Marina but also Electra and Joel.

Understanding that this was an order from their master, the two knelt down on the spot.

<b>

"The fun ends here. Bury this place with your soldiers by the end of today. Tomorrow, we leave with all the soldiers!"

<b>

As Halbert stepped toward the fallen Howard, Marina, who had been straddling him, immediately dropped to the ground and knelt.

<b>

"And, this guy will only last another two to three hours at best! He won't last until noon, kuha! Until then, crush everyone here! Kill them all! Show him how they perish!"

<b>

Halbert mocked as he stomped down on Howard's head.

<b>

"After you've killed every last one of them... finally, you can kill this guy. Do whatever you want, kuha! Kuha ha ha ha!!"

"Halbert-sama... Thank you very much!"

<b>

Marina bowed deeply to Halbert, showing her gratitude, then raised her face, licking the blood dripping from her claws with her long tongue, narrowing her eyes as she looked down at Howard.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"The order is for over ten thousand souls, living or dead."

<b>

Halbert readjusted his grip on the "Despair Bringer" and turned his gaze toward the black rock in the back.

<b>

"Once the soldiers are gathered, we'll break through the forest and harvest as much as we can. ...Until then, I'll be playing with the gifts you brought me. Call me when you're ready."

<b>

With that, Halbert transformed into a mist of miasma, swirling black, and instantly vanished from the spot.

<b>

<b>

As soon as Halbert disappeared, Electra, dressed in a black night dress, stood up, her golden blonde hair shimmering.

<b>

"I have received permission... And the gentleman I desired is right in front of me! Oh, how delightful...! Now! Spend your last moments with me! And please, perish within me!!"

<b>

Electra's black dress enveloped her like spreading shadows, instantly closing the distance to Kyle, and the black shadow loomed over him.

<b>

"Wha?! Kyaaa!!"

<b>

Electra, her eyes glowing like embers, sank her sharp fangs into Kyle's throat.

Having been nearly immobilized by Halbert's gaze, Kyle was helplessly captured by Electra and taken away into the shadowy trees.

After the massive shadow flew away, a chilling laugh from a woman echoed through the forest, fading into the depths.

<b>

<b>

"I'll enjoy myself a bit more! Kihi!"

<b>

Joel, with his beautiful face twisted into a grin, kicked off the ground, sending dirt flying, and similarly vanished from the spot.

But the next moment, Joel appeared right in front of Tony.

<b>

Startled by Joel's sudden appearance, Tony's eyes widened, but he barely managed to raise his shield against the attack of a massive sword that came from below like a huge cleaver.

However, he couldn't withstand the impact, and a loud metallic clang echoed around as Tony was blown backward.

<b>

"Ugh! Kuaaa!!"

"Kihi! What's wrong?! Slash back and entertain me too!! Kihihih!"

<b>

Tony, who had just begun to break free from Halbert's curse, found himself on the defensive against Joel's relentless barrage.

Pushed back by Joel's attacks, Tony was sent flying deeper into the forest.

<b>

<b>

"…Well, there's no helping it, you two!"

<b>

Marina, with her light blue skin, sighed as she looked toward the depths of the forest where the two had disappeared, placing her hands on her hips as if to express her frustration.

Her wounds from Howard had completely vanished, but her attire was mostly torn, leaving her in a disheveled state.

Her long silver hair flowed freely in the wind, brushing against her pale skin.

<b>

"You were told to gather the soldiers... But first, I suppose I need to clean up."

<b>

Marina shrugged as if to say it couldn't be helped and chuckled softly.

She let her arms hang loosely, allowing the chains from her restraints to drag along the ground.

<b>

"Now then, if you keep lying here, you won't see anything, will you?"

<b>

The chains extending from Marina's arms rippled and shot toward Howard with force.

They wrapped around Howard's body haphazardly, roughly dragging him along.

<b>

"Look! I'll take you to your comrades! Just quietly observe your surroundings until you are the last one left! Oho, ahaha! Ahahaha!"

<b>

Howard's body bounced along the ground, scraping against it as he was pulled by the chains.

Marina's mocking voice echoed among the trees.

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Lord Cloud?!!"

<b>

At that moment, I felt a shock upon seeing that abandoned figure, unable to hide my agitation despite being responsible for the knights.

I hurriedly rushed to the fallen figure.

There was no doubt, this was Lord Cloud himself.

What had happened to that strong man?! What on earth had transpired outside?!

<b>

The sight was nothing short of horrific.

His armor was slashed in many places, bearing numerous wounds, and blood loss was severe.

His face bore marks as if dragged, and he was almost completely pale.

It was clear that he needed urgent treatment.

<b>

<b>

▽▲▽▲▽▲▽

<b>

A little while ago, the tide of undead pressing toward us had changed.

<b>

Until now, they had been launching wave attacks, but there had been pauses in between, like they were catching their breath.

However, they suddenly began to exert a crushing pressure all at once.

<b>

Including the higher-tier undead that appeared just before dawn, low-tier undead like skeletons and zombies, which should have been wiped out once, were overflowing again, pressing toward us.

Even though it was daytime, these undead showed no signs of slowing down.

<b>

This was undoubtedly related to the horrifying presence that appeared with the sunrise.

<b>

Immediately after that, Kyle and Tony transported the heavily injured Conrad and Gilberto, but without reporting what had happened, they rushed straight to Lord Cloud, leaving this trench.

<b>

At that time, thanks to the three doctors' powers, many injured were healed enough to move.

With the undead's attacks having lessened, the logistics team was able to reinforce the walls around the trench.

This healing saved many lives. We could never thank the doctors enough.

Moreover, with the increase in manpower, we could rebuild the walls, allowing the solid team to rest.

It was a great relief to give them even a little respite after they had supported the front lines all night.

<b>

However, the wounds of Conrad and Gilberto were strange, as the half-elf woman treating them said.

No matter how many healing spells were cast, the wounds wouldn't close... It seemed that even the wounds that were barely closed would immediately reopen and bleed profusely.

Currently, they were barely managing to stop the bleeding by pressing cloths against the wounds and tightly wrapping bandages.

<b>

About three hours after we had regained our footing, a powerful tremor resonated through the air and ground, accompanied by a blinding flash that seemed to scorch the sky, and a tremor of magical power that made our skin tingle, struck this trench.

It was clearly the impact of immense magical power being unleashed.

Everyone was stirred by the shock, but from inside the walls, we couldn't discern what was happening outside.

As we were discussing whether to send scouts to investigate, a massive army of undead surged toward this trench, filling the ground.

<b>

To welcome back Kyle and the others, we closed the gap we had opened on the northern side with an earth wall.

<b>

The height was about 5 meters, and it covered a diameter of approximately 20 meters, reinforcing the wall once again.

However, the effect of the "Holy Relics" that Lisa and the others had applied to the wall last night had been burned away by the vampire's magic, and the newly constructed wall naturally lacked that effect.

<b>

The encroaching undead were eroding the wall, and from the gaps that were crumbling, undead were spilling in.

As long as we were able to defeat the sporadically entering undead, it was fine, but it was only a matter of time before a significant breach would occur.

<b>

As that sense of crisis grew, something was thrown in from outside the wall.

It seemed as if it had been carelessly discarded, crossing over the wall.

<b>

That was Lord Cloud.

<b>

At that moment, there were reports of a chilling woman's laughter echoing from beyond the wall. It was likely that it belonged to the vampire.

I urgently requested the doctors to treat Lord Cloud, but just like Conrad and Gilberto, they said the wounds wouldn't close.

Even so, I pleaded for them to do everything they could.

<b>

Then the pressure from the undead surged dramatically.

They began to pour in from above, cascading down like a flood.

The logistics team was struggling to repair the damaged wall, but they were falling behind.

Although the undead entering were mostly low-tier, their numbers increased with each passing moment.

It seemed they were coming to crush us in earnest.

<b>

Eventually, the knights could no longer cope, and non-combatants began to suffer casualties.

It might be time to make a firm decision.

We needed to ensure that at least the non-combatants... the civilians survived at all costs.

I called for Fred and instructed him to complete the shelter we had prepared for emergencies.

The "shelter" was a magical measure that created a space surrounded by thick walls underground, allowing evacuees to rest in a state of suspended animation.

At the very least, the three doctors and their female assistant, as well as the civil servant Connor Clarke, needed to survive.

Unfortunately, of the three civil servants, one had fallen during the initial attack, and the second had just recently sunk among the undead.

We could not allow any more casualties under any circumstances.

<b>

Just as I was about to advise the five to evacuate, the upper part of the wall collapsed dramatically, and an unprecedented number of undead tumbled in.

I quickly issued instructions to Cornell and the solid team to form a central wall.

We had to protect them until the five doctors could evacuate to the shelter.

<b>

However, the knights were severely exhausted.

Everyone's "Magic Storage Devices" were likely running low.

Many had probably exhausted their "Magic Accumulation Containers" as well.

<b>

As if mocking us, the waves of undead intensified.

Could we not stop that overwhelming tide?

<b>

Just as I was filled with a sense of resignation, a shock like a gust of wind swept through the wall.

Like dry leaves caught in a fierce wind, the undead were blown away, turning into particles of light and vanishing.

<b>

What on earth had happened?!

I felt as if a glowing ripple had pierced through the southern wall, spreading as a shockwave.

Before I could even process it, another shockwave spread.

This time from above.

A glowing ripple spread from the sky toward the northern side.

I could see that most of the undead gathered there were blown away by the current shock.

<b>

Looking up, I saw a shadow.

A horse? Was a horse flying?

<b>

And from there, another shadow separated.

<b>

Against the swirling light, a human figure emerged.

...........Was that an angel...?

<b>

<b>

And the descending savior called out in a loud voice.

<b>

"Papa Howard!!"
