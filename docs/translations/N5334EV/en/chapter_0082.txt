# 77 The Return of the Cloud

This is the last episode of Chapter 2.


----------------

<blank>

Suddenly, the soldiers were blown away.

<blank>

All Marina felt at that moment was astonishment.

There was no way that they would have the strength to do such a thing.

However, the soldiers who had crowded around their prey had neatly disappeared.

<blank>

But this is not the time to be dumbfounded.

Life from the Lord is absolute.

He told us to trample those who are here.

Then we must do it.

<blank>

Marina immediately instructed the next group of soldiers.

Trample this place down now! And.

<blank>

However, before the soldiers could gather, the thing popped out from inside the wall.

<blank>

Marina was not even given a moment to seriously check her appearance, and her body was returned to the light.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Elektra was overcome with anger.

<blank>

Suddenly, he was blown away, not only interrupting our meeting, but also causing severe damage to his own body.

The missing body was quickly repaired, but the overflowing anger was not something that could be easily contained.

<blank>

When I return to the place, I see that the little girl is standing beside the man of her choice.

I don't know how the pissy little bitch did it, but this is the guy who blew himself up," Elektra's intuition told her! Electra's intuition told her.

<blank>

Normally, one should be very wary of an unknown person, but there is no way that Elektra, who has forgotten herself in her anger, would be so concerned.

Immediately afterwards, he hit the "Flaming Bomb".

If hit seriously, it is a powerful magic that can knock off the limbs of even the weakest human being. There was no way this little girl could withstand it.

<blank>

But the flaming bullet that flew away suddenly stood still in midair and disappeared.

Elektra is momentarily stunned, unable to comprehend what has happened.

<blank>

I noticed that the little girl was pointing her hand at me to release her magic.

But the little girl is chanting a prayer of congratulation. What she is trying to use is not "direct magic" but "spirit magic.

<blank>

I can't help but snicker.

Is someone who doesn't even understand the logic of magic trying to turn on me?

I will show you the folly of those who are too inexperienced to wield power without the help of spirits to stand against you!

<blank>

But Elektra's taunt is instantly obliterated.

The amount of magic gathered there was extraordinary. The density was impossible.

The heterogeneity of its way of being makes me shudder.

<blank>

What exactly do I have in front of me now?

This is something you should never encounter!

<blank>

Elektra had already extinguished her body a moment after the shiver ran through her entire body.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

"......! You! Where the fuck did you come from?

<blank>

Joel's machete-like sword was flung away from him, and he stared at his suddenly appearing opponent and let out a snarl.

<blank>

What's up? You're still alive?"

<blank>

The figure called out to the knight, who fell to the ground, his heavy armor missing everywhere and moaning from his many wounds.

<blank>

"Hmm! You want to play with me too?"

<blank>

Joel smiles at the sudden appearance of this large woman in a black cloak, showing his white predator-like fangs with a grin.

Joel shook his body as if in a blur and disappeared from the scene.

<blank>

The next moment, right behind the woman, Joel appears with his fangs bared and his great sword drawn down.

The great sword was brought down with blinding speed, and just when it looked as if it would bite into the woman's shoulder, the blade came to a sudden halt.

<blank>

It was because the woman, Aria Burok, had caught the blade in an instant with her left hand, which was a black glove made of the leather of a magical beast.

<blank>

Joel's eyes widen at this fact, and he tries to pull his sword back, but it doesn't budge. Joel's astonishment is compounded by the fact that he can't pull the sword back.

<blank>

"............ masakana."

<blank>

Aria, who had accepted the sword without looking behind her, muttered quietly.

<blank>

"You don't really think it's going to get this powerful?"

What?

<blank>

Aria felt her own power increase unbelievably under Suzy's auxiliary magic.

Once again, Suzy's out-of-standardness is a bit of a surprise.

Joel, however, was not aware of Aria's feelings and raised his eyebrows quizzically.

<blank>

Joel also tried to pull the sword out with all his might, but it did not seem to move at all.

<blank>

There, Aria unexpectedly let go of the blade.

The great sword that had been chained to the ground was unleashed, and Joel, with an excess of force, taraed to the second half.

<blank>

"...... you!!!"

<blank>

Joel bites his fangs with a grimace, regains his grip on his great sword, and disappears again.

<blank>

Aria, her carrot-orange hair bouncing up on either side of her head, shook her cloak and put her hands on the two battle-axes at her waist.

He quickly pulled them out with his left and right hands, and swung his left-hand axe straight out to the side as if to shake it off.

<blank>

With a dull metallic sound, Joel appeared in mid-air, blown away, his great sword bounced off the ground and his blade shattered.

<blank>

Joel lets out a short moan and his body is lifted into the air, his face contorted in anguish.

Not to miss the slightest opportunity, Aria threw the battle-axe in her other hand with her muscles flexed to the fullest.

<blank>

The battleaxe, filled with dense magical power, glowed white and split the atmosphere with a spinning roar, catching Joel at his core.

A high-pitched axe-pounding sound echoed through the trees, and Joel found himself blown backwards to a large tree and slammed into its trunk.

<blank>

The blade of the battle axe severs the thin string that connects the bikini top, which has only a small area, and Joel's ample twin breasts burst forth.

At the same time, blood splashes violently from it.

The battle axe had struck Joel in the chest and shattered his spinal cord as well, driving his body deep into a large tree.

Joel spits a large amount of blood out of his mouth as well with a scream.

<blank>

Joel's body was drained of strength, as if his power was leaking out along with the blood he was shedding.

Furthermore, the glow emitted by the battle axe becomes stronger and begins to burn Joel.

Joel's eyes stare into the void and his hands slowly rise as if seeking something.

<blank>

Ma, Marina ....... Elektra ....... Halbert ......, my dear ............."

<blank>

At least it's ....... I'll let you go soon, 'Shine Axe'!"

<blank>

At the same time that Aria spoke the words, the battle axe shot up a red flame, and a torrential flame like a pillar of light enveloped Joel's body.

Joel's body, which had been flooded with blood even from his eyes, was engulfed in flames with a desperate cry, and suddenly turned to dust and vanished.

<blank>

Eventually, the thin pillar of flame disappeared, leaving in its place only a battle-axe that pierced the great burnt tree.

Aria looked up at the ashes that rose and disappeared into the heavens, meditated briefly and quietly, and then pulled her battle-axe from the great tree and returned it to its holster at her waist.

<blank>

He immediately rushes to the knight who is lying on the ground and checks his wound.

He is unconscious, but not life-threatening. If we patch him up right away, he'll be fine. ......

Judging this to be the case, Aria carries her wounded knight, Tony Easton, on her shoulders and hurries back the way she came.

<blank>

Still surrounded by a horde of undead, heading for the trenches protected by their comrades.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Two of the first three major reactions have already been obliterated by the lady. The other one Aria is on her way to, so it's all good."

<blank>

Team Aria's summoner, Ms. Ketty Forrest, will be using spirit-based detection magic to convey information about the battlefield.

Everyone who was wounded in the trench has been fully healed by the healing magic of the young lady, and with the replenishment of mana batteries brought by Mr. Luke and Ms. Casey, they have returned to the front line.

Furthermore, Master Luke, Master Casey is playing a very active role on the front lines with the help of your daughter's enhancement magic.

Seeing Luke-sama repel several undead at once with a single swing of his nightsword, his spear-axe-wielding colleague's eyes widened behind his glasses.

I am sure that this is all due to your daughter's help!

<blank>

Ketty! Millie! Gather as many undead around as you can, as we discussed! But never let them in!

Yes, sir!"

I know!"

<blank>

The teaching priest, Ms. Ilta Lindeman, sends her instructions to Ms. Ketty and Milly Barrett.

As planned, Master Irta set up the warding device in the center of the trench and began to deploy the art of its activation.

<blank>

Millie. Leave the small stuff to the Knights, we'll crush the big guys for now."

Copy that." Mr. Ketty!

Millie Barrett. If you do well, I'll reward you later."

"Oh hee hee? That's it... ............"

<blank>

Millie Barrett, waddling and adorably flustered, slithered through the crowd of undead and disappeared behind the front lines.

<blank>

Mr. Ketty snaps one outstretched finger toward the front line.

A bead attached to the back of his hand emitted light, and a spirit appeared as if dancing, then disappeared again as if dissolving in the air.

At the same time, with a light earth tremor, a huge ivy rose up through the earth and entangled the "Old Scale Dinosaur" that was there.

The ivy tightens around the giant undead, not only stopping it from moving, but also shattering its mighty bones with a crunch.

<blank>

Above their heads, something twinkled for a moment.

Immediately after, a single line of light pierced the undead's massive skull like a tiny meteor.

<blank>

The "Old Scale Dinosaur" was pierced from directly above by a strike from a millie barrette that seemed to be integrated with a large dagger.

With its skull crushed, "Old Scale Dinosaur" returned to the earth, its huge body rattling and crumbling.

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm, you do it well.

Even though it was a joint front by the two of you, to slaughter a big guy with a threat value of over 100 with just one blow ......, it shows that your daughter's power is great after all!

<blank>

I can't lose either.

It is not suitable for large enemies, but it can be used for humanoid enemies.

<blank>

Even now, I can feel the presence of people heading this way as they weave through the shadows of the trees.

The second finger of the left hand, lightly bent up at the elbow, is moved with a snap, and the shadowy figure lurking in the shadows is torn vertically and falls to the ground.

The knights around him were startled by the sound of his demons, but his white figure and red eyes were definitely a vampire.

<blank>

However, I do not like its guise.

A white costume like a maid. Combined with her white appearance, she looks like a maid all in white.

<blank>

Are you being an unholy vampire and trying to be sarcastic about our work or something?

It is really unpleasant.

<blank>

Unlike other skeletons and zombies, these people do not come at you head-on.

They hide in the shadows and try to exploit our blind spots.

But I, this I, will not allow such a thing.

The young lady has entrusted us with her husband's affairs.

We cannot allow any number of people to pass through here.

<blank>

Manipulating the fingers of both hands, he simultaneously cut down eight more vampires lurking in the shadows.

The sound of multiple wind breaks echoes around the area.

<blank>

Suddenly, I noticed that a white vampire was creeping toward one of the knights, as if looking for an opening.

By making a small return of my right wrist, I bring one knife back to my hand and pinch it between the second and third fingers of my right hand.

The knife is sent flying again with a light flick of the two fingers between them.

The knife instantly pierced the vampire's brow as he approached the knight's blind spot.

The impact of the knife wound makes the vampire's head turn up and his body lose its position, causing the single steel thread that connects the knife to my finger to flex like a wave.

The wave of steel from my fingertips became sharper and sharper as it left my fingers, and when it reached the vampire's body where the knife had struck it, it sliced it in half.

<blank>

Yes, my weapon is a steel thread that I manipulate with my fingertips and four knives on each side that are connected to the end of the thread.

This steel thread, made of magical steel, boasts a high magic rate and receives my magic power to the fullest, unleashing powerful and unrestricted attacks.

The art of manipulating this "steel thread of the blade" is my fighting technique.

There are not many who can get through this steel thread and knife ward!

<blank>

Moreover, I have received the power of the Lady, and it is as if power is overflowing from within me!

Now! The Lady is in me!

Ahhhh! What bliss!

<blank>

Where can we find anyone who can compete with us, who have become one with the Lady?

Come on! If you do not fear this boiling power, come and take it!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Soon after, Lady Aria returned with one wounded knight, reaping the undead.

With Aria joining in to protect them, the walls will become even thicker and more solid, and the undead will be able to stand in front of them.

Soon, Master Iltar will be ready.

<blank>

Shortly before Aria's return, a violent impact and earth tremors were heard from the direction of Kuroiwa.

The knights were upset about it, but we knew immediately that this was what the young lady had done.

The fact that the husbands' condition was calmed down immediately after that proved this point.

<blank>

Aria! I'm ready to go! It's a strong ward, so be careful not to be blown away by the impact! Get as close as you can to the immobilized heads!

<blank>

Master Irta spoke up and said that the warding device was ready.

The warding will revolve around the device and will spread over a wide area.

In order to avoid being shocked as much as possible when the warding occurred, we asked the logistics team to assist the immobilized masters and carried them, along with the non-combatants, to the vicinity of Master Iltar.

<blank>

The crown shall be adorned with the name of harmony.

The flow of its wisdom shapes the river.

And to that knowledge is given proof.

From that mercy emanates a boon.

Its rigor punishes great sins.

Its pure light reveals beauty.

The Goddess triumphs in her eternity.

Praise be to the gods for their eternity."

In the name of Mother Terrill, protect us.

<blank>

Yasuragiyo, kikkari yotoku, kaerukaeshi!"

<blank>

Master Irta chanted a congratulatory prayer in praise of the seven world deities as if singing, and activated the warding device.

<blank>

A pillar of pure light rose up from the warding device and suddenly seemed to spread across the walls around the trench, purifying the dirt around it.

The fearful chorus of vindictive voices raised by the undead subsided like the ebbing tide.

<blank>

Soon after, all signs of uncleanness were swept away, and a pure wind blew, and Aria-sama declared her victory in high spirits.

The Knights of the Order are shouting their battle cries, embracing each other, praising each other, and shaking with joy.

<blank>

The husbands are also resting with good facial complexion and rested.

I am sure your daughter will be back shortly.

Come on, we must welcome you.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Not one more undead remained between the black rock and the trench.

<blank>

The radiance from the warding device had enveloped even the black rocks beyond, and the miasma in the area had been cleanly purified of its unholy miasma.

That's great, Ilta! It's quintessential!

<blank>

When we returned to the trench, AnnaMarie met us in front of its entrance.

AnnaMarie told me immediately that the Howard Papas were no longer a concern.

<blank>

I asked AnnaMarie to take me to the place where Howard was resting, and there he was, resting with a peaceful face.

<blank>

............ Good.

Although I had known by the signs, seeing his face in person like this made me realize once again that Howard Papa was recovering.

Kneeling beside him, I took his hand, wrapped it in both of mine, and placed it on my own forehead. The warmth of the hand was so directly felt that my vision involuntarily became distorted.

AnnaMarie gently held out a handkerchief to catch the drops that spilled from her cheeks.

<blank>

After that, I was once again left to AnnaMarie to take care of Howard Papa and the others and bring everyone on Team Aria back to Black Rock.

There are people and things that need to be recovered.

<blank>

When we passed through the rift in the black rock and arrived at the other side of it, Aria and the others were immensely impressed.

Hey, why not?

Sure, the ground may be a little gouged out, but I don't think ...... it's that ...... bad, okay?

Yeah, well, compared to the old top, that ...... is a bit of a bummer! Nah! It's nothing! It's nothing!

<blank>

Aria said that no knighthoods should ever pass through here, and sentenced the area to a complete blockade.

Well, it's true that thanks to the presence of the undead, there are no hexenbiests in the vicinity now, but the threat value of a hexenbiest that comes out here is dangerous for the people of the Order alone, usually!

Surely you can't let it through!

<blank>

<blank>

When we showed him to the cave, he told us that one of the bodies inside was a friend of his, Irta.

He said he was very sorry and politely offered his prayers to everyone.

<blank>

When I showed her the items I had found inside as well, Irta froze on the spot.

Even the arias are losing color.

The miasma that is coming out quite a bit should have subsided, but the residuals alone might be hard to deal with normally. ......

<blank>

After regaining her composure, Ms. Irta, losing her color, said, "This is something that must be sealed up.

He says that it may be an ancient and dangerous curse that appears in very old documents.

He also says that the concentration of the noxious gas exuding out of the building proves it.

<blank>

Indeed, when I refocused my attention and looked at the item again, I could see that it had a fearful name, something like "The Craving of the Dead" or something like that.

Oh, I'm so glad I put my energy into it ahead of time and made him mature.

If it had stayed that way, people wouldn't have been able to get even close to the entrance of the cave.

<blank>

Irta-san, for the time being, neatly rolled it up with the holy cloth he had on hand, and after applying several layers of warding magic on it, he was finally able to lift it up by hand.

He also said that when we returned to the campsite, with the help of the logistics unit, we must build a covenant chest, store it there, and carry it out of the forest as soon as possible.

<blank>

Do you want me to take it? I suggested, "Absolutely not! and Aria and Mr. Irta vehemently and vehemently opposed me.

I don't know what will happen to me, and on the other hand, what if I break it? What if I break it?

It's kind of rude, isn't it? I wouldn't break anything that much, would I?

<blank>

And well, I can't help saying that!

The item is a rather intolerable object, but historically speaking, it is very valuable and its academic value is immeasurable, he said.

And they mustn't let anything happen to it.

This means that it is advisable to have it formally and strictly warded in the village temple as soon as possible and transported to the Temple Authority in the Royal Capital for controlled research.

<blank>

It was something of a more difficult task than I thought it would be! Hmmm, I'm glad I didn't break it. ......?

<blank>

The bodies recovered from the black rocks and the two injured, Magritte and Raisa.

And ancient cursed items! Well, it's literally a cursed item! By the time we had carried the "Mere Old Man" back to the trench, the sun was already setting.

<blank>

Returning to the trenches, the Knights were pleased that Magritte and Raisa were safe, but were deeply saddened when they saw those who had been brought in dead.

<blank>

A total of 11 people were killed in the search: five from the knightly order, including those of the Holy Order, four from the logistics unit, and two from the clerical staff that accompanied them.

I was very angry that the victims were those who did not have the ability to fight, and that women were targeted first.

I realized once again that vampires are the ones who should be exterminated as soon as they are found!

Duh! From now on, as soon as I see them within my perception, I'll delete them! I will!

<blank>

<blank>

When the sun set, the knights were given an early rest.

There were a number of people who said they would be on night watch, but the knights, who have been fighting for almost the entire day, need to get a good night's rest!

All the knights were properly rested tonight, as we were told that Team Aria would take care of it.

<blank>

The next day, Howard Papa and his family woke up, but they were still not in perfect health.

It seems that it will take more time for the etheric body, once dissolved, to fully return.

<blank>

Still, the non-combatants,...... professors and administrators of the university, left first thing in the morning, saying that they had to return to the human village immediately.

Mr. Irta also left with us because the cursed object had to be dealt with as soon as possible.

About a third of the knights will also return to the village ahead of time as an escort.

<blank>

The rest of the knights also began to pull up toward the village before noon that day.

<blank>

However, Howard and his family were not in a hurry, and we decided to accompany them home slowly.

<blank>

<blank>

After the Knights departed, Howard Papa and the others said there was a place they really needed to go before leaving.

He also said that the original purpose of his trip to Irosio was to go there.

<blank>

He said they would go on their own, but he is not ready to walk alone yet.

So, I helped Howard, Aria helped Conrad, and Anna Mary helped Gilberto.

<blank>

It was on a black rock, about a kilometer east of where the undead were swarming.

There stood a black rock about the size of a man, as if it were a tomb or a monument of some kind.

<blank>

This was once a man," said Papa Howard. said Papa Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

Decades ago now.

When Howard Papa was still in his teens, a party of Howard Papa and his friends, who had just moved up to the upper echelon, took on the challenge of extending their exploration beyond this black rock.

But for the Howard fathers at the time, the barriers were much higher than they thought, and they were finally able to return to this place.

He said that everyone was hurt at the time and that Conrad and Marsh were the only ones who could make a serious move.

To add insult to injury, the party was attacked by demonic beasts here as well, and when the party was nearly destroyed, a half-elf, the only one with a holy position, took his own life to save the party.

<blank>

He said that the loss of Mr. Roland had been a long time in everyone's hearts.

These three, Mr. Marsh and one other person. And with Roland, the six of us had been a team for a long time.

<blank>

The three of them sat in front of a black stone and quietly sipped each other's drinks, enjoying the quiet moment.

<blank>

<blank>

We returned from Black Rock and got lunch before leaving the trench.

The main body of the Knights ahead of us should be setting up camp at the spot where we last rested yesterday, so we should be able to reach there before nightfall.

Millie and Ketty were accompanying the main body of the knighthood, so they were supposed to prepare the food ahead of time.

<blank>

<blank>

So we walked through the forest and retraced our steps to Amkam.

<blank>

The village was not reached until three days after the advance party had arrived in the village.

Before reaching the Tsumesho, I was greeted by Augusto and the rest of the village at the "Hill of Sorrows".

They all carried the three of us straight to the Tsumesho.

<blank>

Conrad's family greeted him at the stuffing station.

In short, they are the parents of Aria and Lombardo.

Of course, Lombardo was there.

As soon as I saw his face, everyone in the family was calling me out for being a bitch, but Mr. Conrad didn't seem to be listening. ......

It's still the same, and that's a relief.

<blank>

Gilberto's family was also there.

I thought Mr. Gilbert was a small old man, but as a "glass foot" he was a big man.

I saw them for the first time, but their sons looked much smaller.

His grandson, who was watching anxiously behind him, was adorable.

Little girls are so hot to look at!

<blank>

I left the station with Howard's father.

It is not the Amcam House where we are headed.

It's my home away from home.

<blank>

I pull Regulus' reins and we move forward slowly.

AnnaMarie is following behind them with her luggage.

<blank>

If you look to the right at Hodgson's Pond, you can sometimes hear the sound of water in the distance, as if fish were jumping.

Papa Howard is silently rocking on Regulus.

I can see Dad looking around as if to make sure.

<blank>

Once past the tree-lined avenue of blackberries, the familiar hills are already in sight.

From the north side of the road, you will reach a gentle uphill slope on the south side of the road to go around a house surrounded by a windbreak.

<blank>

With slow, sure steps, Regulus made his way up the hill to the front door.

With AnnaMarie's help, I was able to get Howard Papa down from Regulus, and although he was still a little unsteady on his feet, he was able to land squarely in front of the front door.

<blank>

As AnnaMarie set down her luggage and opened the front door, Papa Howard was able to step quietly but sure-footedly into the house.

Then he tells me one thing.

<blank>

Sonia, I'm back.

Welcome back Howard. Aren't you tired?"

<blank>

Sonia, Mom? You don't look ......, not even a little ......, not even a little plain when you put so much effort into your hands around Papa's back with a scowl on your face, do you?

Thank you for reading.

I will drop the "Epilogue" and "Chapter 2 Characters" later today.
