# Chapter 77: The Return of Cloud

This will be the final chapter of the second volume.

----------------

<b>

Suddenly, the soldiers were blown away.

<b>

What Marina felt at that moment was nothing but shock.

There should have been no military force capable of such a feat here.

However, before she realized it, the soldiers that had surrounded the prey had completely vanished.

<b>

But this was not the time to be dazed.

The orders from the master are absolute.

That person commanded to crush those present here.

Then she must execute that order.

<b>

Marina immediately gave instructions to the next soldiers.

Crush this place right now! 

<b>

However, before the soldiers could gather, it burst forth from within the wall.

<b>

Marina was not even given the chance to properly confirm its appearance before her body was returned to light.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

Electra trembled with rage.

<b>

Not only was she suddenly blown away, interrupting her meeting, but she also suffered severe damage to her own body.

Her damaged body quickly repaired itself, but the overflowing anger was not something that could be easily quelled.

<b>

When she returned to that place, she saw a young girl standing next to the man she desired.

She did not know how the smelly little girl had done it, but her intuition told her that this was the one who had blown her away!

<b>

Normally, one should take sufficient caution against an unknown opponent, but Electra, consumed by anger, had no room for such thoughts.

Immediately after, she unleashed 'Flame Burst'.

If it hit directly, it was a powerful magic that could blow apart the limbs of a weak human. There was no way such a little girl could withstand it.

<b>

However, the fireball she launched suddenly extinguished in mid-air.

Electra could not understand what had happened and was momentarily dazed.

<b>

When she noticed, the little girl was pointing her hand at her, about to cast magic.

But the girl was chanting an incantation. She was not trying to use 'Direct Magic' but 'Spirit Magic'.

<b>

Electra couldn't help but snicker.

Was this person, who did not even understand the principles of magic, trying to bare her fangs at her?

A novice who could not wield power without borrowing the strength of spirits would learn the foolishness of opposing her!

<b>

However, Electra's scorn was instantly blown away.

The amount of magical power gathering there was abnormal. Its density was impossible.

She felt a chill at the strangeness of its existence.

<b>

What am I facing right now?

This is something I should never encounter!

<b>

In that instant, as the chill ran through her entire body, Electra had already vanished.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“...! You! Where did you come from?!!”

<b>

Joel glared at the suddenly appeared opponent, having his large sword, resembling a hatchet, deflected, letting out a growl-like voice.

<b>

“Hey? You’re still alive?”

<b>

The figure spoke to the knight lying on the ground, heavily armored and wounded, groaning.

<b>

“Hmph! You want to play with me too?”

<b>

Joel grinned, showing his white carnivorous teeth at the large woman clad in a black cloak who had appeared suddenly.

With that, Joel swayed his body as if to blur and vanished from that spot.

<b>

The next moment, Joel appeared right behind the woman, baring his fangs, swinging down his large sword.

As the sword was brought down at a speed that did not even allow blinking, it seemed to sink into the woman’s shoulder.

However, the blade came to a complete stop.

<b>

This was because the woman, Aria Blouk, had instantly caught the blade with just her left hand, gloved in black leather made from magical beast hide.

<b>

Joel's eyes widened in disbelief at this fact, and as he tried to pull back his sword, it did not budge at all. This only added to his astonishment.

<b>

“...No way.”

<b>

Without looking back, Aria murmured softly as she held the sword.

<b>

“Could it really be that my power has increased to this extent?”

“What did you say?!”

<b>

Aria felt her strength had risen to an unbelievable level thanks to Suzy's support magic.

She was once again amazed by Suzy's extraordinary abilities.

However, Joel had no way of noticing Aria's feelings and furrowed his brows in suspicion.

<b>

Furthermore, Joel, as if sewn in place, put all his strength into pulling the sword, but it showed no sign of moving at all.

<b>

At that moment, Aria suddenly let go of the blade.

The large sword that had been held in place was released, and Joel, with too much force, stumbled backward.

<b>

“...You!!”

<b>

Joel gritted his teeth, regripping the sword and disappearing again.

<b>

Aria, shaking her carrot-orange hair that bounced on both sides of her head, forcefully threw off her cloak and placed both hands on the two battle axes strapped to her waist.

She quickly drew them with each hand and swung the left axe horizontally in a straight line.

<b>

With a dull metallic sound, Joel's large sword, which should have been brought down, was deflected, and he was sent flying through the air.

<b>

Joel let out a short groan, his expression twisted in agony as he floated in the air.

Seizing that brief opening, Aria threw the battle axe held in her other hand with all the muscle she could muster.

<b>

The battle axe, infused with dense magical power, glowed white as it spun, slicing through the air with a roar, striking Joel at his core.

The axe produced a high-pitched sound as it struck like a tree being hit, and Joel was blown back against a large tree.

<b>

The blade of the axe severed the thin strings that connected the bikini top, causing Joel's ample bosom to burst forth.

At the same time, a violent spray of blood erupted from there.

The battle axe pierced through Joel's chest, shattering his spine, and drove his body deep into the tree.

Joel screamed as he coughed up a large amount of blood.

<b>

As if to say that along with the blood he spilled, his strength was also draining away, the tension in Joel's body rapidly diminished.

Furthermore, the glow emitted by the battle axe intensified, beginning to burn Joel's body.

Joel's eyes stared vacantly into the void, and his hands slowly rose as if seeking something.

<b>

“Ma, Marina... Electra... Halberd... sa... ma...”

<b>

“At the very least... I will send you off quickly with 'Shine Axe'!”

<b>

As Aria spoke, the battle axe erupted in crimson flames, enveloping Joel in a pillar of blazing light.

Joel's body, which was also shedding blood from his eyes, was consumed by the flames along with his dying scream, instantly turning to dust.

<b>

Eventually, the pillar of flames thinned and only the battle axe, embedded in the burned tree, remained at the scene.

Aria looked up at the ashes rising and disappearing into the sky, closed her eyes briefly in silence, and then withdrew the axe from the tree, returning it to her waist holster.

<b>

She then hurried to the knight lying on the ground and checked the condition of his wounds.

Though he was unconscious, there was no danger to his life. If treated immediately, he would be fine...

Judging so, Aria hoisted the wounded knight, Tony Easton, onto her shoulder and hurried back to the path they came from.

<b>

Heading towards the trench, where her comrades were surrounded by the undead army.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Of the three large reactions that were initially present, two have already been eliminated by the young lady. The remaining one is headed by Aria, so there is no problem.”

<b>

Keti Forest, the summoner of Team Aria, conveyed information about the battlefield using detection magic with spirits.

Everyone who had been injured in the trench was fully healed by the young lady's healing magic, and thanks to the mana batteries brought by Luke and Casey, they have returned to the front lines.

Moreover, Luke and Casey, empowered by the young lady's enhancement magic, were making significant contributions on the front lines.

Seeing Luke blow away several undead with a single swing of his knight's sword, a colleague holding a spear and axe widened his eyes behind his glasses.

All of this is indeed thanks to the young lady's power!

<b>

“Keti! Millie! Gather as many undead as you can around us! But do not let them inside!!”

“Understood!”

“I got it!”

<b>

The chaplain, Irta Lindman, issued instructions to Keti and Millie Barrett.

As planned, Irta began setting up the barrier device in the center of the trench and started to deploy the activation spell.

<b>

“Millie. Leave the small fries to the knights and let's take down the big ones for now.”

“Got it! Keti!!”

“Millie Barrett. If you do well, I’ll reward you later.”

“Uhyah?! Wh-what is that...”

<b>

Millie Barrett flustered adorably, slipped through the swarm of undead, and disappeared deeper into the front lines.

<b>

Keti snapped her fingers, extending her finger towards the front lines.

The magic orb attached to the back of her hand glowed, and a spirit appeared as if dancing, then melted away into the air again.

At the same time, accompanied by a light tremor, a massive vine burst forth from the ground, entangling the 'Old Scale Dinosaur' that was there.

The vine tightened around the massive undead, not only stopping its movements but also cracking its strong bones with a crunching sound.

<b>

Something glimmered above it for a moment.

Immediately after, a line of light pierced through the massive skull of the undead like a small meteor.

<b>

What pierced through the 'Old Scale Dinosaur' from above was a strike from Millie Barrett, seemingly fused with a large dagger.

The skull of the 'Old Scale Dinosaur' was shattered, and its massive body crumbled and returned to the ground.

<b>

Hmm, quite impressive.

Even though it was a joint effort between the two, to take down a threat exceeding 100 in a single blow... it truly shows the young lady's great power!!

<b>

I cannot afford to fall behind.

While I am not particularly suited to facing large enemies, I have no problem with humanoid ones.

<b>

Even now, I sense a presence approaching this way, weaving through the shadows of the trees.

As I lightly flex my left hand's second finger, a figure hidden in the shadows is split vertically and falls to the ground.

The dying scream of that vampire startled the knights nearby, but its white form and red eyes were unmistakably those of a vampire.

<b>

However, I do not like its attire.

It wore a white outfit resembling that of a maid. Combined with its white appearance, it looked like a maid entirely clad in white.

<b>

Is this a taunt regarding our work, despite being a filthy vampire?

It is truly unpleasant.

<b>

Unlike other skeletons and zombies, they do not approach head-on.

They lurk in the shadows, trying to exploit our blind spots.

However, I will not allow such a thing.

I have been entrusted with the matter of the master.

No one shall pass here.

<b>

I manipulated my fingers to simultaneously slice through eight more vampires lurking in the shadows.

The sound of multiple winds cutting through the air echoed around.

<b>

Suddenly, I noticed a white vampire sneaking up on one of the knights, waiting for an opening.

I subtly turned my right wrist to bring a knife back to my hand, pinching it between my second and third fingers.

With a light flick of those two fingers, I sent the knife flying again.

In an instant, the knife pierced the vampire's forehead, which was approaching the knight's blind spot.

The impact of the knife caused the vampire's head to jerk back, losing its balance, and I sent a steel thread connecting the knife to my fingers, rippling like a wave.

The steel wave released from my fingertips grew sharper and larger as it distanced itself, reaching the vampire's body that had been halted by the knife, slicing it in half.

<b>

Yes, my weapon consists of steel threads manipulated by my fingertips and four knives connected to them on each side.

This steel thread, made of magical steel, boasts a high magical conductivity, fully receiving my magical power, allowing for powerful and versatile attacks.

This technique of manipulating the 'Blade Steel Thread' is my combat art.

Few can slip through this barrier of steel threads and knives!

<b>

Moreover, I am currently receiving the young lady's power, and it feels like strength is overflowing from within me!

Now! The young lady is within me!!

Ahh! What bliss!!!

Who could possibly stand against us, now that we have become one with the young lady?!!

Come! If you are not afraid of this surging power, come at me!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Before long, Aria returned, carrying an injured knight while sweeping away the undead.

With Aria joining the defense, the wall became even thicker and sturdier, standing firm against the undead.

The preparations by Irta will soon be complete.

<b>

Just before Aria returned, a loud impact and tremors were felt coming from the direction of Black Rock.

The knights were unsettled by this, but we quickly understood that it was something the young lady had done.

Most importantly, immediately after that, the conditions of the masters stabilized, which proved it.

<b>

“Aria! We can go anytime!! Be careful not to be blown away by the shock from the strong barrier! Bring the immobile heads of state as close as possible!!”

<b>

Irta raised her voice, announcing that the preparations for the barrier device were complete.

The barrier expanded widely around the center of the device.

To minimize the shock during the barrier's activation, the logistics team assisted in bringing the immobile masters closer to Irta along with the non-combatants.

<b>

“'That crown is adorned with the name of harmony.

Its flow of wisdom shapes rivers.

Its reason is given proof.

From its mercy, blessings emerge.

Its strictness punishes great sins.

Its pure light manifests beauty.

The goddess triumphs in her eternity.

Let us praise the eternity of the gods.'

In the name of Mother Teril, protect us.

<b>

May peace and light return to us!”

<b>

Irta chanted the incantation praising the seven world gods and activated the barrier device.

A pillar of pure light rose from the barrier device, instantly spreading beyond the walls surrounding the trench, purifying the surrounding filth.

The dreadful chorus of wails from the undead began to diminish, as if the tide was receding.

<b>

Eventually, the tainted presence was swept away, and a pure breeze began to blow as Aria declared victory loudly.

The knights raised their battle cries, embracing each other in joy, celebrating together, trembling with happiness.

<b>

The masters also appeared to be in good spirits, resting peacefully with a healthy complexion.

The young lady would return soon.

Now, we must welcome her back.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

There were no undead left between Black Rock and the trench.

<b>

The radiance from the barrier device enveloped even Black Rock, beautifully purifying the surrounding tainted miasma.

Amazing, Irta! As expected of you!!

<b>

Upon returning to the trench, Annemarie welcomed us at the entrance.

She immediately informed us that Howard and the others were no longer in danger.

<b>

If Annemarie took me to where Howard was resting, there he was, resting with a peaceful expression.

<b>

...I’m glad.

I had sensed it, but seeing Howard's face directly made me realize his recovery.

Kneeling beside him, I took his hand and wrapped both of mine around it, placing it against my forehead, feeling its warmth directly, causing my vision to blur involuntarily.

Annemarie gently caught the droplets spilling from my cheeks with a handkerchief she offered.

<b>

After that, I entrusted the matters concerning Howard and the others to Annemarie and decided to take Team Aria back to Black Rock.

We had people and items to recover.

<b>

As we passed through the rift at Black Rock and arrived on the other side, Aria and the others were left speechless.

W-what the?!

Sure, the ground might be a bit dramatically gouged... but not to that extent... right?

Yeah, compared to how it used to be, it’s not that... cough cough! No! It’s nothing! It’s not a big deal!

<b>

Aria insisted that the knights must not be allowed through here and ordered a complete blockade.

Well, it’s true that there are no magical beasts in the vicinity now thanks to the undead, but normally, the threats that could emerge here would be dangerous for just the knights alone!

It’s definitely not safe to let them through!!

<b>

<b>

When we guided them into the cave, one of the corpses found inside turned out to be an acquaintance of Irta's.

She expressed her deep regret and offered prayers for everyone.

<b>

When we showed her the items we found inside, Irta froze on the spot.

Aria and the others also lost their color.

Even though the miasma should have subsided considerably, it seems that even the remnants can be quite overwhelming...

<b>

Regaining her composure, Irta, still pale, stated that this was something that must be sealed away.

She said it was likely an ancient and dangerous cursed object mentioned in quite old literature.

The density of the miasma seeping out proves that, she said.

<b>

Indeed, when I focused my awareness again and looked at the item, I realized it was something called 'The Thirst of the Dead', a truly dreadful name.

Ah, I’m so glad I had the foresight to subdue it beforehand.

If I hadn’t, everyone might not have been able to approach the cave entrance!

<b>

Irta carefully wrapped it up with the holy cloth she had on hand, and after casting multiple layers of barrier magic over it, she finally managed to lift it.

Furthermore, she stated that once we returned to the camp, we would need to enlist the help of the logistics team to create a holy coffin and transport it out of the forest as soon as possible.

<b>

When I suggested that I could carry it, Aria and Irta vehemently opposed me, saying it was absolutely not allowed.

They seemed to worry that something might happen to me, and conversely, what if I accidentally broke it?

It felt rather rude, didn’t it? I don’t break everything, you know?!

<b>

Well, it doesn’t matter what I say!

This item is indeed a dreadful thing, but historically, it is also extremely valuable and holds immeasurable academic worth.

Moreover, they said that we must not allow any accidents to happen.

It is advisable to apply a formal and strict barrier at the village temple as soon as possible, and transport it to the capital's temple office for management and research.

<b>

It turned out to be a far more significant item than I had thought! Phew, I’m glad I didn’t break it...

<b>

By the time we returned to the trench with the corpses recovered from Black Rock, along with the injured Magritte and Lysa, the sun was already beginning to set.

<b>

Upon returning to the trench, the knights rejoiced at the safety of Magritte and Lysa, but they were enveloped in deep sorrow upon confirming the corpses that had been carried.

<b>

In this exploration, five members of the knight order, including those of holy rank, four from the logistics team, and two from the administrative staff who accompanied us, totaling eleven people, had fallen.

I felt a strong indignation that those without combat power had become victims, and even more so that women were specifically targeted.

Realizing that this was all due to the vile nature of the vampires, I strongly recognized that they should be exterminated on sight!!

Yes! From now on, I will eliminate them as soon as they appear within my range of recognition! That’s what I’ll do!!

<b>

<b>

As the sun set, the knights were quickly allowed to rest.

Though there were several who said they would stand guard for the night, the knights, having fought for almost a full day, needed to rest properly!

Tonight, we would take care of things as Team Aria, ensuring that all the knights got proper rest.

<b>

The next day, Howard and the others awoke, but their condition was still not perfect.

It seems that the etheric body, once disrupted, requires quite a bit of time to fully recover.

<b>

Even so, the non-combatants... the university professors and administrative staff... had to return to the village as soon as possible, and they set off early in the morning.

Irta also left with them, saying that the cursed object needed to be dealt with as soon as possible.

About a third of the knight order would also return to the village ahead of us, serving as escorts.

<b>

The remaining knights began to withdraw towards the village around noon that day.

<b>

However, Howard and the others were not in a hurry, and we decided to accompany them back slowly.

<b>

After the knights departed, Howard and the others stated that there was a place they absolutely had to visit before returning.

They mentioned that the original purpose of their trip to Iroshio was to go there.

<b>

Though they insisted they could go alone, it was still too difficult for them to walk by themselves.

So, I would assist Howard, Aria would help Conrad, and Annemarie would support Gilberto, each taking them along.

<b>

This was about a kilometer east from the place where the undead had gathered, atop Black Rock.

There stood a black rock, about the size of a person, resembling some sort of tombstone or monument.

<b>

This was once a human, Howard said.

<b>

<b>

Many decades ago.

When Howard was still a teenager, his party, who had just risen in rank, attempted to explore beyond this black rock.

But for Howard and his companions at the time, that wall was higher than they had expected, and they barely managed to return to this spot.

At that time, everyone was injured, and only Conrad and Marsh could move properly.

Furthermore, as if to add insult to injury, they were attacked by magical beasts here, and when the party was on the verge of annihilation, the only holy rank member, a half-elf, sacrificed themselves to help everyone escape.

<b>

The loss of that person, named Roland, had left a long-lasting scar in their hearts, Howard said.

These three, along with Marsh and another, had been a team for a long time.

<b>

The three sat before the black stone, quietly sharing the alcohol they had brought, spending some quiet moments together.

<b>

<b>

After returning from Black Rock, we had lunch and then left the trench.

The main body of the knight order should be camped at the last place we rested yesterday, so we should arrive there before sunset.

Millie and Keti were accompanying the main body of the knight order, so they had arranged for preparations in advance.

<b>

<b>

Thus, we slowly made our way through the forest, following the path to Amukam.

<b>

We reached the village three days after the advance party had arrived.

Before we reached the outpost, we were welcomed by the villagers, including August, at 'The Hill of Lamentation'.

They carried the three of us to the outpost.

<b>

At the outpost, Conrad's family was waiting for us.

In other words, it was Aria and Lombard's parents.

Of course, Lombard was there too.

As soon as I saw their faces, the whole family began to scold him, but Conrad didn’t seem to be listening...

As usual, and that was reassuring.

<b>

Gilberto's family was also there.

I had thought Gilberto was a small old man, but as 'Glassfoot', he was quite large.

It was my first time meeting him, but his sons looked quite small in comparison.

The granddaughter who was watching with concern behind him was adorable.

Little girls are just heartwarming to watch.

<b>

I left the outpost with Howard.

We were not heading to Amukam House.

We were going to my nostalgic home.

<b>

I led Regulus slowly, with Annemarie following behind me, carrying the luggage.

<b>

As I moved past Hodgeson's Pond on my right, I could occasionally hear the sound of fish jumping in the distance.

Howard sat silently on Regulus, swaying slightly.

I could tell he was scanning the surroundings to confirm.

<b>

Once we passed the row of black trees, the familiar hills were right in front of us.

From the northern road, we turned south onto a gentle uphill path, surrounded by windbreak trees.

<b>

Slowly, with steady steps, Regulus climbed the slope and reached the front of the entrance.

With Annemarie's help, I helped Howard down from Regulus. Though his steps were still a bit unsteady, he managed to get down firmly in front of the entrance.

<b>

When Annemarie opened the front door after placing the luggage down, Howard quietly but surely stepped inside the house.

And he spoke a single line.

<b>

“Sonia, I’m back.”

“Welcome back, Howard. Are you not tired?”

<b>

Sonia? With a crumpled face, how could you put so much strength into the hand you placed on Papa's back... it doesn’t look... not at all... not a bit cold?

<b>

Thank you for reading.

I will post the "Epilogue" and "Characters of Volume 2" within today.
