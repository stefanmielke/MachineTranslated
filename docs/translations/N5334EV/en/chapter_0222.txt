# Chapter 210: Coridona's Tears

The blue skirt is layered with drapes, and from its deep slit, brown legs peek out seductively.

The blue fabric covering the chest is wide open, generously displaying a rich cleavage.

A woman with brown skin clad in that blue dress is supporting and holding Karen with her left hand.

She leans in to look at Karen's face in her arms, narrowing her emerald eyes.

Her black, silk-like hair flows down smoothly.

<b>

"Long time no see, Karen. I'm so happy to see you again."

<b>

The fingers of the woman's right hand, free from supporting Karen, move softly.

Her nails are blue, elongated like knives.

And those nails are all stained with red blood.

<b>

"After all, it was best to pluck your most precious thing right in front of you, wasn't it? ...Ufu! Ufufufufu."

<b>

The woman, with a smile that seems unable to contain her joy, peeks into Karen's face she holds in her arms.

<b>

"After taking time to suppress it, letting emotions burst forth creates a good sprouting. I tried to do that, but... the result was disappointing. ...However, it can be said that it is because of that that we are here now. Efforts should indeed be praised. Ufufufufufu."

<b>

She carefully licks the blood dripping from her fingers, stained with her own nails, using her long tongue.

As if savoring it slowly over time.

<b>

"Ahhh... Just as I thought, this girl is also very good... Truly wonderful. The taste of a pure, untainted maiden!"

<b>

While looking down at Cordelia, the woman sensually licks her own nails and fingers.

As if savoring the droplets of youthful life.

<b>

"Ahh! I want to soak myself in the droplets of this youthful life... How much willpower is needed to suppress this impulse! Do you understand?"

<b>

After licking all the red droplets from her fingers, she wraps her right arm around herself, twisting her body with an ecstatic expression, shivering as if enduring something.

<b>

"But for now, I must hold back... Because tonight's main character is you."

<b>

The woman lovingly strokes Karen's cheek with the tip of her nails.

The length of those nails has somehow become such that they fit within her fingers.

<b>

"...The hidden temple of the fire god... The priestess serving Coridona. It took quite a bit of effort to trace that bloodline... But finally, yes."

<b>

Karen, still held by the woman, breathes heavily, her chest rising and falling violently, her eyes wide open staring into the void.

<b>

"Did the magical tool I lent you come in handy?"

<b>

The woman brings her nails from Karen's cheek to her mouth, teasing her soft lips with the tips of her nails.

<b>

"Not only did it enhance your body, but it also broadened the range of your emotions and allowed you to wield strong magical power, right? Ufufu, you seemed to be having so much fun, didn't you?"

<b>

It's unclear if the woman's words are reaching Karen. Her eyes, looking up at the sky, reflect nothing.

<b>

"Thanks to you using it a lot, these children were able to bond well with you... Thank you."

<b>

One of the dark red lines drawn on Karen's face rises as if alive, wrapping around the woman's finger like a pet.

<b>

"Your emotions surged, and when they burst forth, they pierced through the soul shell, connecting to the mind-body, allowing access to the priestess's power sleeping within you. Thanks to that, I was able to penetrate the protection of the gem that guards the priestess, this 'Tears of Coridona.'"

<b>

The woman moved her finger to Karen's chest.

She spread her five fingers and thrust them into the small stone shining at the center.

<b>

"Now, the 'Holy Grail' to open the temple can be extracted."

<b>

Her blue nails sank deeply into Karen's chest.

<b>

"Ahhhhhhh――――――――――――――――ッ！！"

"The 'Tears of Coridona' that protected the priestess transforms into the 'Holy Grail' when it senses the priestess's unbearable despair."

<b>

While narrowing her eyes, the woman watched Karen scream, enjoying her reaction as she slowly sank her fingers deeper into Karen's chest.

Karen tries to arch her body back, but her body, bound by the dark red light, does not move at all.

<b>

The woman cradled the small red gem that had been in Karen's chest in her palm, sinking her hand deeper into Karen's chest until she finally grasped her heart.

<b>

"――――――――――――――――――――ッッッッッ！！！！！！"

<b>

From deep within Karen's throat, an inarticulate scream was endlessly squeezed out. At the same time, her body arched back in an abnormal manner.

The woman's mouth curled up in a satisfied smile.

<b>

With a swift motion, the woman's hand was pulled out from Karen's chest.

In her hand was a small cup, stained with Karen's blood, dripping red droplets.

She raised the extracted cup and gazed at it brightly, then extended her long tongue to slowly lick the blood from her own hand, now dyed bright red with Karen's blood.

Suddenly, a flush appeared on the woman's cheeks, her melted gaze displaying ecstasy as she let out a deep sigh.

And while maintaining that ecstatic expression, the woman continued to lick the blood from Karen that stained the cup.

<b>

Eventually, after licking almost all the visible red blood, she held the cup before her, closed her eyes, and inhaled the scent within deeply.

<b>

"Ahhh, wonderful... Truly a wonderful scent, Karen."

<b>

Then she placed her lips on the rim of the cup and took a sip of the red droplets of life filling it.

She savored that sip slowly, rolling it around in her mouth, enjoying it fully before swallowing it down with a sense of great reluctance.

The woman couldn't help but feel immense pleasure from the sensation as it slid down her throat.

<b>

"Ahhh, lovely, Karen. What a rich and sweet flavor... The depth of your despair is conveyed. It is worthy as an offering to our true king. It was worth the years of aging."

<b>

Then, pulling the cup away from her mouth, she sighed deeply, as if genuinely reluctant to part with it.

<b>

"Ah, it's a shame, but I must stop here... Truly, a strong willpower is necessary to resist temptation."

<b>

The woman smiled as if she had just made an amusing joke, her mouth twisting into a wide grin.

<b>

"...But that's why it was such a wonderful sip."

<b>

Immediately after, she carelessly discarded Karen's body onto the stone pavement, as if losing interest.

Then, once again, she held the cup filled with Karen's blood with both hands, raising it high with reverence.

Her eyes began to take on a golden hue, shining with an eerie light.

<b>

"If the blood from the priestess's heart is poured into the 'Holy Grail of Coridona,' the path to the hidden goddess's temple will be revealed."

<b>

While holding the cup high, the woman shone her golden eyes and poured a small amount of magical power into it.

Then the cup in her hand began to emit a gentle glow.

<b>

"And with the priestess's blood, the doors of the temple will open... It connects to one of the keys to end the world."

<b>

She quietly lowered the glowing holy grail to chest height.

The light emitted by the grail gradually grew stronger and larger.

<b>

Suddenly, the woman glanced down at Karen and the remnants of the slain synthetic beast.

<b>

"Oh? Do you want this?"

<b>

She noticed that a part of the still writhing mass of flesh was stretching toward Karen, who lay on the stone pavement.

<b>

"Well... the child inside this is much richer than you."

<b>

On the stone pavement, Karen's body, with her heart removed, convulsed as if the muscles were contracting.

The dark red light spreading across her body flickered as if trying to convey something.

<b>

"Very well, enjoy it."

<b>

Still holding the glowing cup in her right hand, the woman bent slightly, carelessly grabbing Karen's arm and throwing it toward the center of the mass of flesh.

Instantly, the wave of flesh enveloped Karen's body, sinking her into the mass.

<b>

"Ufufufu... You'll become something that is not human. That too is an amusement."

<b>

The woman smiled with a temperatureless grin, watching the scene as she murmured.

The cup in her hand began to shine even brighter.

<b>

"Such a lovely Karen... Thank you. And farewell."

<b>

The light expanded greatly, eventually enveloping the entire woman.

Then, abruptly, the light vanished. There was nothing left of the woman or the cup.

<b>

Only the sound of the writhing, moist mass echoed ominously around.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Eventually, the grotesquely writhing mass of flesh began to take on a definite shape.

It stood up on thick legs like a powerful giant beast.

Thick skin covered its entire body like armor.

From its shoulders protruded two long horns, aggressively jutting forward.

<b>

And where the neck of that creature would be, a human form could be seen.

Like a distorted centaur, the upper body of a girl extended from the waist up.

<b>

On that person's body, dark red lines ran everywhere like war paint.

The lines on her face seemed to be continuously shedding blood-like tears.

<b>

Then her mouth opened wide, and she let out a cry toward the heavens.

A mournful wail filled with despair echoed throughout the area.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the same corner of that high ground, a pure aura began to fill the space quietly and solemnly.

It faintly lit up with a small, delicate golden light.

To bring forth a certain miracle.
