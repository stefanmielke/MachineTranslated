# 210 Tears of Coridona

The blue-and-blue skirt was draped in layers, and brown legs peeked out from its deep slits in a glamorous manner.

And the blue fabric covering her breasts was wide open, generously revealing her ample cleavage.

The brown-skinned woman in the blue dress is holding Karen with her left hand in support.

As it was, she looked into Karen's face in her arms and squinted her emerald eyes.

Her black silky hair flows down smoothly.

<blank>

It's been a while, Karen. It's good to see you again."

<blank>

The fingers of the vacant woman's right hand, opposite the hand supporting Karen, move softly.

The claws were blue, each long and knife-like.

And their fingernails are all coated in red blood.

<blank>

I knew it was best to pluck your most prized possession right in front of you, didn't I?　...... Hmmm!　Mmmmmmmm."

<blank>

The woman looked into the face of Karen, who was holding her in her arms, with a deep smile on her mouth, as if to say that she could not contain her joy.

<blank>

He said, "If you let your emotions play out after you've held them down for a time, they will sprout good. That's what he said, so I let him try it, but ...... the results were disappointing. I'm sure it's a good thing that I did. ...... but it's because of that that we are where we are today. I think we should praise them for their efforts. Mmmmmmmmmm."

<blank>

He then carefully licks off the blood smeared on his fingernails and dripping onto his fingers with his long tongue.

Take your time and savor it.

<blank>

"Ahhhh ....... Just as I thought, she is also very good ....... It's really wonderful. The taste of an unadulterated, pure maiden!"

<blank>

The woman looks down at Cordelia lying on her side and licks up her own fingernails and toes in a glamorous manner.

Taste the drop of its youthful life.

<blank>

Ohhhh!　I want to squeeze and bathe this body with every drop of this youthful life. How much willpower does it take to suppress ...... this urge?　Do you have any idea?"

<blank>

After licking off all the red drops from his fingers, he put his right arm around himself as if to embrace himself, twisted his body with an ecstatic expression, and shook himself as if enduring something.

<blank>

But you have to endure it now. ...... Because you are the star of the show tonight."

<blank>

The woman lovingly strokes Karen's cheek with the tip of her nail.

The length of his fingernails had somehow become so long that they could fit on his fingers.

<blank>

The "...... hidden fire temple. A priestess in the service of ...... Coridona. It took me a long time to trace the lineage, but I ...... found it. At last."

<blank>

Karen is still in the woman's arms, breathing heavily, her chest rising and falling violently, her eyes wide open and staring into the void.

<blank>

Did the magic tools I lent you help?

<blank>

The woman brings her nails from Karen's cheeks to her mouth and plays with her soft lips with the tips of her nails.

<blank>

"Not only did it strengthen your body, but it also broadened your emotional range and clothed you in powerful magic, didn't it?　Mmmm, that sounded like a lot of fun, didn't it?"

<blank>

I don't know if the woman's words reached Karen. Nothing is reflected in her eyes as she looks up at the sky.

<blank>

Thanks to your generous use, these children have adjusted well to you. Thank you ......."

<blank>

One of the reddish-black lines on Karen's face floated up like a living creature and clung sweetly to the woman's fingers.

<blank>

The explosion of your emotions pierced through the shell of your soul, and then you were able to access the power of the miko that lies dormant within you. Thanks to that, I was able to penetrate the blessing of the Tears of Coridona, the jewel that protects the priestess.

<blank>

The woman moved her fingers to Karen's chest.

Five fingers spread out to encircle the small stone that was shining in the center of it, and thrust it forward.

<blank>

Now we can retrieve the chalice to open the temple."

<blank>

Its blue claws sank into Zubli and Karen's chest.

<blank>

'Aaaaahhhhhh --------! --------!!!"

The "Tears of Corydona," which protected the priestess, transformed itself into a "chalice" when it sensed her unbearable despair.

<blank>

I watch Karen's eyes narrow as she cries out, and I sink my fingers into her breasts as if I am enjoying her reaction.

Karen tries to turn herself over, but the reddish-black light restrains her body and she doesn't move a muscle.

<blank>

The woman placed the small red jewel in Karen's chest in her palm and sank her hand deep into Karen's chest, finally grasping her heart.

<blank>

"-- ------------------ ッッCOPY00"

<blank>

An unspoken exclamation was squeezed endlessly from the back of Karen's throat. At the same time, her body was turned upside down to an unusual degree.

The woman's mouth hangs wide with satisfaction.

<blank>

Zubori and the woman's hand was pulled from Karen's chest.

In his hand was a small cup. It was smeared with Karen's blood and dripping red drops.

He held up the cup he had taken out and gazed at it dazzlingly, then reached out his long tongue to his own hand, which was stained red with Karen's blood, and licked it off slowly and lovingly.

Suddenly a blush appears on the woman's cheeks, her prodigal eyes show signs of ecstasy, and she sighs loudly.

Then, with a look of ecstasy on her face, the woman licks off Karen's blood on her hands and cup.

<blank>

Eventually, after licking most of the red blood from his eyes, he raised the cup in front of him, meditated, and inhaled the aroma in it with all his heart.

<blank>

Oh, it's wonderful. ...... It really does smell wonderful, Karen."

<blank>

Then he put his mouth to the rim of the cup and took a sip of the red drop of life that filled it.

He takes his time and rolls it around in his mouth, tasting and enjoying it to the fullest, before downing it with great reluctance.

The woman can't help but feel great pleasure even at the feel of it going down her throat.

<blank>

Oh, it's lovely, Karen. How mellow and sweet ....... I can feel the depth of your despair. It's as good as any offering to our true king. It was worth the years of aging."

<blank>

Then, he moved the cup, still brimming with its contents, away from his mouth and muttered a sincere regret.

<blank>

'Oh, I'm sorry, but I have to leave it at this: ....... Really, it takes a lot of willpower to resist temptation."

<blank>

The woman's mouth contorts into a wide grin, as if to say that she has just uttered a funny joke.

<blank>

......, but that's why it was such a great bite."

<blank>

Immediately afterwards, he dumped Karen's body onto the cobblestones in a careless manner, as if he had lost interest in her.

Then, once again, he holds the cup filled with Karen's blood in both hands and raises it reverently high.

His eyes begin to take on a golden hue and glow with a bewitching light.

<blank>

The blood from the priestess's heart pours into the Chalice of Coridona and fills it, revealing the way to the hidden temple of the goddess."

<blank>

With the cup held high, the woman's golden eyes sparkled and a small amount of magic flowed into them.

Then the cup in his hand also begins to glow quietly.

<blank>

And with the blood of the priestess, the doors of the temple will be opened. ...... It will lead to one that will lead to the key to end the world."

<blank>

He quietly lowers that glowing chalice to chest height.

The light emitted by the chalice gradually grows stronger and larger.

<blank>

Suddenly, the woman looked at Karen at her feet and the remains of the slaughtered synthetic magical beast.

<blank>

"Oh?　You guys want this?"

<blank>

He noticed that a portion of the still writhing mass of flesh was extending toward Karen, who was lying on the cobblestones.

<blank>

Well, ......, the kids in this one are a lot thicker than you guys."

<blank>

On the cobblestone pavement, Karen's body, with its jittery muscles converging and its heart drained out of it, is slumped.

The reddish-black light spreading over his entire body was flickering as if appealing to something.

<blank>

Fine. Suit yourself.

<blank>

The woman bent over slightly with her right hand holding the glowing cup, grabbed Karen's prone arm carelessly and threw it to the center of the mass of flesh.

Suddenly a wave of flesh covers Karen's body, and her body sinks into the flesh.

<blank>

"Ummm........., you become what you are not. That's part of the fun."

<blank>

The woman smiled a temperatureless smile, looked at him and muttered.

The cup in your hand becomes even more luminous.

<blank>

'Thank you so much Karen ...... for being so lovely. And goodbye."

<blank>

The light spread wide and eventually enveloped the woman's entire body.

Then, abruptly, the light disappears. There the woman and the cup are scratched away, and nothing is left behind.

<blank>

The only sound was the dampness of the writhing mass of flesh, echoing fearlessly around the area.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Soon, the fearlessly writhing mass of flesh begins to take on a definite shape.

It stood up on four thick legs, like a powerful giant beast.

Thick skin covers the entire body like armor.

Two long horns protruded aggressively forward from both shoulders.

<blank>

And if it is the creature, you can see a human figure in the position where the neck is.

Like a distorted man-horse, it stretched from the girl's waist up.

<blank>

The person's body has reddish-black lines running everywhere like war makeup.

The lines on their faces look as if they are continually shedding tears of blood.

<blank>

Then its mouth opened wide and it cried out to the heavens.

The whole area is filled with the sad and despairing lamentations of a young girl.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

On the same hilltop, a clean air began to quietly and majestically fill the air.

It is small and fine, with a faint golden light.

To create a sure miracle there.
