# 90 - The Spirit Seal (Aether Seal)

Today, the day after the entrance ceremony, general classes have not yet started.

Today, we will first carve our spiritual marks," said Ursula Lewin, our first class teacher, during our morning meeting. We are going to engrave spiritual marks today," said Ursula Lewin, the homeroom teacher of the first class, during the morning meeting.

<blank>

From the top of the podium, Mr. Ursula instructs us to move swiftly out of the classroom, swinging his chonmage, which flutters out from the podium, to the right and left.

The move is to the main school building and the adjacent Magic Technology Building.

We all began to move around the classrooms, relieved to see the teacher working hard to instruct the students to leave the classrooms in order.

Yup! There's something soothing about a busy, moving Dr. Ursula!

<blank>

Today's imprinting of spiritual seals will be done in the order of our first group, he said.

<blank>

We're going to get stuck here! Let's move quickly!"

<blank>

Dr. Ursula's voice comes from behind me, as if to drive me away.

<blank>

When I say engrave, I don't mean to do something physically like getting a tattoo, but rather to engrave a "mark" on our individual spiritual bodies.

Some classes require the use of magic tools, and above all, without a spirit seal, "direct magic" cannot be used.

It is essential to have a spiritual seal in order to learn and acquire magical skills.

The entrance examination includes a written test for the "Magical Technician Qualification Examination," and the standard for passing the test is to have exceeded the magic value required for the qualification.

After that, once you have engraved the spirit seal, you will be a qualified "Mage Certificate Level 4"!

We are finally taking the first step up the ladder of adulthood! We did it!

<blank>

<blank>

We were brought to a room in the magic technology building.

There were about four young men and women in the classroom, and I was urged to sit in the chairs lined up inside.

These people are students of the university who were invited by the university to be teaching assistants for the day.

In other words, they are our seniors. The older brothers and sisters smile kindly at us and lead us to our chairs, smiling and telling us not to worry.

I sat down in the chair and was handed something nostalgic.

Two Merikensacks that fit snugly in both of my palms!

<blank>

Yes, the apparatus that was once used in Dr. Henry's temple. This is a part that came with it.

I remember that time I sat on the couch holding an object similar to this one and asked him to use the device. ......

<blank>

Please put your fingers through it and grip it tightly! If you don't have a good grip, you may not be able to access the etheric body, so please be careful!

<blank>

I see. So this part you hold in your hand is what you need to access the etheric body.

<blank>

It kind of reminds me of that time ....... I was a little nervous about hanging on to the equipment, but I remember Howard's dad was kind enough to watch over me, and it was kind of a relief.

I remember how big and warm my dad's hands were at that time. ......, ugh! Oh no! I'm going to cry......! I'm gonna cry...... normalcy, normalcy,............ mmm, okay! I'm calm, that was close!

<blank>

I'll get started right away! Everyone please relax and lean back in your chairs!"

<blank>

As soon as the doctor operated the equalizer-like device on the wall, I felt a slow warmth coming from my fingers through the grips, and my entire body began to feel warm.

It is the same as that time. Surely this is the state in which the device is accessing the etheric body.

<blank>

But that warmth will disappear in no time.

Unlike when I used the apparatus, it was much more assuring.

<blank>

Those who have finished, please move to the next room in order!"

<blank>

Dr. Ursula herds everyone into an adjoining living room to facilitate a quick move.

The room we moved to is more like a large preparation room than a classroom? A warehouse of magic tools? There were tools that looked like junk, randomly placed on desks or arranged in a messy manner in shelves.

The room also contained a number of other shelves, similar to the shelves in a library.

As we were led to a row of shelves in the back, the doors of the shelves were opened and we could see the items placed neatly in a row inside. There was a large number of small lantern-like magic tools.

The teaching assistants, who were also in this room, handed the magic tools to us one by one.

<blank>

"I'll have them use it to make sure the spirit seal is working!"

<blank>

<blank>

They are now going to use this magical tool to check the operation of the spirit seal after the imprinting is complete.

Even though it is called confirmation, it is not something particularly difficult to do, but just activating the magical equipment as usual.

<blank>

They use a small lantern-shaped magical tool that lights up just by touching it.

For now, I was told to simply turn the lights on and off repeatedly.

They say that this is how they make the spirit body remember that the spirit markers work.

<blank>

Put your hand on the bottom part of the lantern and it lights up. Touch it again and it goes out. It looks like a touch-sensor light.

The lanterns should light up with a normal touch, but some of them don't light up at least once.

<blank>

Even if it doesn't turn on right away, please try again and again! You'll get used to it as you repeat it over and over again!

<blank>

I talked to each of the Ursula teachers and went around giving advice to the children who were confused because things were not going well.

<blank>

Hmmm. Mr. Cloud has no problem! As I expected! Please continue as you are for a while longer.

<blank>

Dr. Ursula moves away, her tail wagging above her head with a pique. Yeah, it's still healing.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, it's working now.

It's on! I dotted it! I've scored in a row!"

"Oh, oh! Me too!

<blank>

After a while, such voices began to be heard from all over the place. It seems that everyone is gradually getting used to each other.

Yes, yes, everyone looks happy. There are even children who are shouting with glee.

That's right. Now I can turn on the magic tools by myself and operate them on my own. It's like proof that I'm on my own now!

I am also excited about it, even though I don't look like it!

<blank>

"Yes, yes, yes! Now that everyone has settled in, let's move on to the next classroom! Please keep your current magic tools with you! The next one will be held up, so please move quickly!

<blank>

They want me to take the lantern home with me as it is and spend the day operating the grimoire to familiarize myself with the spirit seal.

I was told by a teaching assistant that I should keep using it for a day at any rate until tomorrow, whether while chatting or studying.

<blank>

<blank>

As I left the magic preparation room led by Ursula-sensei and proceeded down the corridor, I passed by a group of children from Class 3. They were probably on their way to ether sealing.

All the children in the third group passed us, looking at the lanterns we were holding in our hands and turning on and off with a curious look. I was curious about them.

I spotted Karen in the line. So I gave her a small wave and she spotted me and waved back with a smile.

I was so happy and relieved that the Countess of yesterday was also nearby and her eyes met mine. I remembered that Karen was in the third group with this Countess.

I smiled at her as a way of saying hello, and she seemed to be trying to say something and turned her body toward me.

Bibi, who was standing next to me, reacted quickly to the situation of the young lady, and her eyebrows twitched.

But there, one of her attendants, who was also with the daughter yesterday, turns her body around in a great hurry and returns her to the flow of the line.

The child, too, bowed his small head and immediately returned to the flow of the line.

Hmmm, I feel like I'm seeing shadows of hard-working people in your current appearance.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

My name is Joseline Joslin, and I am the teacher in charge of the practical training in magic. I'm Joseline Joslin and I look forward to working with you.

<blank>

In the next classroom, another teacher was waiting.

They look about the same age as us, but since they are half-elves, their actual age is different from their appearance.

But, what is it? I think I've seen this teacher ...... somewhere before? Where was it ......? I don't think I saw you at the entrance ceremony. ......

Were you there for the entrance exam?

<blank>

The classroom I was brought to was much smaller than the ones I had seen before. There were no desks, only chairs.

No, it's not like a classroom, is it? You know, the "briefing room" you see in the movies where the pilots are briefed on the mission before they go out? It's a room like that. The teacher is not standing in the front of the room, but standing with his hands on a small desk diagonally to the right of us, next to a spacious wall where a screen could be lowered, as if he were giving a presentation. It was as if he was saying, "I'm going to give you a briefing on the mission. I felt strangely excited thinking about it!

<blank>

"First of all, I would like to give you a brief basic explanation of how to activate magic at ....... Uh, is this going to be your first magic lecture after you've enrolled?"

<blank>

In a tone of voice that stretched my excitement, Ms. Joseline was to give me my first lecture on magic after entering this school.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

First of all, what is magic again?

Magic is the supernatural skill of interjecting information into a well-ordered material world and creating impossible events.

<blank>

Normally, you cannot suddenly generate fire in this empty space in front of you.

We can suggest several possibilities for the generation of fire, such as the presence of solidified flammable gas here, or the concentration of heat at a specific point due to uneven heat radiation, but in a space without any such elements, there is no way for a fire to be generated.

<blank>

Likewise, in this enclosed space, if nothing is done, wind will not occur.

And it is impossible for air to flow from one side to the other and for a difference in atmospheric pressure to occur in the air.

<blank>

Furthermore, water does not like high places and prefers to flow in low places.

It will not make its way from a low place to a high place. Also, if you throw something into the water, it will sink to the bottom of the water if it has a greater specific gravity than the water.

<blank>

And what you see here is just an egg. This is a boiled egg that was served at breakfast. We will enjoy them later.

I'll take ...... but before I do, what happens if I let go of this egg like this? It will fall to the floor. That is the natural order of things.

But! Will you not fall on the floor and stay here and wait for me to taste you?

Or maybe, if you drop it down, even if it hits the Gensho stone used for the flooring, it won't shatter the shell, but on the contrary, it will shatter the flooring stone. ...... How can such an insane thing happen?

In reality, it would only be a tragedy that the egg would be smashed and the raw egg would be smashed, and the boiled egg that I had carefully saved for my enjoyment would be spoiled in an instant.

And then Ursula-senpai will kick my butt and say, "Why are you making a mess on the floor? I can see a realistic future where I will be kicked in the butt by Ursula! (I will do no such thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

<blank>

This is all a natural reality. It is a natural phenomenon that is taken for granted.

<blank>

However, it is "magic" that makes impossible events happen in such a natural reality.

This is made possible by rewriting and manipulating the information content of ether, the semi-spiritual, semi-material, dark existence that encompasses the information of the bright material world, from the reverse side.

Spirit magic" is a method in which the magician orders this ethereal being, the spirit, to provide magical power to cause an event to occur.

However, from the standpoint of magical efficiency, it can never be said to be highly efficient, since a large amount of magical power must be given to the spirit. In addition, the fine-tuning and application of magic is also a highly difficult aspect.

<blank>

On the other hand, the "direct magic" that you will learn from now on is a method of directly connecting to etheric information through the "spirit seal" that you have just engraved and causing events to occur. Although learning and using magic is much more difficult than "spirit magic," the adjustment and customization of magic can be expanded as much as the skill of the practitioner allows. I believe that this is a technique that becomes more profound the more one learns.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, in order to learn that magic, we must first pull the magical information from the spiritual archives.

A psychic archive is an artificially created archive on the surface of the arcasha that contains a great deal of magical information.

The holder of the spirit seal will have access to the archive and will be able to read the information.

The depth of access to the archive is limited by the grade of the spirit seal, so if you want to access deeper information, work hard to raise your grade.

<blank>

In order to use magic, you must first read the magical information you wish to use from this archive and record it in your etheric body.

The magical information recorded in one's etheric body is called "spirit groove.

Magic is manifested by passing magic power through this spiritual groove.

<blank>

Chanting is the key to the manifestation of magic, which is carried out by the flow of magic power into the grooves of the spirit.

Even a very thin spirit groove at the beginning of use will gradually grow into a thicker one as the magic is used repeatedly and the magic is channeled over and over again.

The thicker the groove becomes, the more magic can be expressed even with short chanting. If one becomes more proficient, it is not impossible to perform magic without chanting.

<blank>

Magic is not something that anyone can master immediately after learning it.

Remember, magic is a skill that needs to be practiced.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Dr. Joseline's magic lectures generally went something like this.

The lecture, with images projected on the wall in front of the room, was really like a "briefing room explanation," and I don't want to confess that I kept going up in my seat!

<blank>

After the lecture, each person went forward in turn to "learn the magic".

A "grimoire" is used to learn magic.

The "book" was not made of paper pages.

It is made by binding two boards together so that they can be opened. It was about the size of a B4 sheet. On one side, there were letters in great detail, and on the other side, there was a design like a magic circle.

It was painted ...... or rather dug in. The brightly colored paint was poured over the dug-in letters and patterns, and even just looking at it, you feel a sense of excitement, like when you're looking at a beautiful picture book. It's a bit of craft, you know? This is!

When it was my turn, I was allowed to touch it, but it was not made of wood. It was not made of wood. It looked like ceramics. Yes, it was an artifact made of some mysterious material.

When we place our palms on the magic circle of the grimoire, a channel is opened and magical information is transferred to our etheric bodies through the spirit seal under the guidance of our teacher, Ursula.

The grimoire itself does not contain any magic, but is merely an authentication key to access specific magical information in the archives.

So we are talking about as many of these "grimoires" as there are magical ones.

When learning magic, they are supposed to do so under the supervision and approval of a "master" with a "grimoire" corresponding to that magic, as I have just done.

<blank>

At any rate, those who had finished learning the magic were told to move to the next room in order.

The next room was much larger than the "briefing room" we had been in earlier. The next room was much larger than the "briefing room" we had been in earlier, and looked like an indoor shooting range.

This is where you try to activate the magic you've learned.

The magic we have just learned is "magic barrier. It is a simple magic that gathers magic power at the tip of the hand held out and deploys a defensive shield.

<blank>

"The kneading of magic, the convergence and release of magic. With this magic, you will learn all the basic magic manipulations and pathways of magic in order to use magic.

<blank>

After the lecture, while waiting for the students to learn magic, Ms. Joseline moved to the Kochira room and instructed the students who had finished learning magic to activate it in turn.

<blank>

First of all, please make sure that your chanting is strong enough to create the magic.

<blank>

In the beginning, it is important to be aware of the rhythm of the words and the pitch of the sounds.

<blank>

"For today... just being able to feel the flow of magic power... will be a blessing... Please don't take it too hard.

<blank>

"In the past, in order to use magic, you had to meditate, access the universal unconscious, and go through a lot of tedious procedures, but now that etheric technology has been established, it's so much easier, thank God! Isn't that right?

<blank>

Ms. Joseline is watching each student and saying a few words to each of them. I, too, was late to the party, but I immediately tried to activate the magic!

<blank>

"Protect me with the power of the primordial spirit, the word of the principle, and the power of the root. "The magic barrier."

<blank>

The "chanting" is very short because it is basic magic, he said.

When I "chant," I feel a flow of magic power in my body that I have never felt before.

It is an indescribable sensation, as if blood is flowing for the first time in a newly formed blood vessel.

Instead of suddenly sending a large amount of magic into this first created pathway of magic, send a finely regulated flow of magic. It should be poured with an eyedropper ......, or absorbed with a tissue like dripping water, in minute, fine, delicate ...... quantities.

<blank>

This may be similar to the feeling of delicately pouring Ki into a branch tree where I practiced before!

If you poured too much Ki into it, the branch would burst. I don't think my arm would explode if I poured too much magic power into the stone. .................. Well, let's pour in magic power with more than enough care. ......

<blank>

Soon, we can see that the magic power is gradually forming a circuit-like pathway. If we can create an outlet for it, the magic should manifest itself.

You said that the exit should be made at the end of the tact in your hand so that it is easy to visualize.

He also said that once you get used to it, you can make an exit anywhere. Whether it's fingertips, elbows, soles of feet, you can do it from anywhere.

First of all, it is important to recognize the image of magical manifestation not as an image, but as an actual thing with a sense of reality. Hmmm, this way of thinking is also similar to the teachings of Ki. For me, it is easy to understand. I am sure that everyone at AMCAM who teaches Ki will be able to grasp this sense very quickly!

<blank>

As if coming out from the tip of the tact, the "magic barrier" was completed when the magic power was deployed as if quietly exhaled.

At the tip of the tact that I hold out, I feel a huge round shield being formed, enough to hide my entire body.

<blank>

"Hohoho, Miss Kuroki and Miss Cloud...have they already done it? At first, it was very difficult to pass the magic power through this tiny spiritual groove, and at first, we had a hard time, and we had a hard time, and we had a hard time, and we suffered a lot, and we fell down seven times....... ...... The skill in controlling the magic power is unparalleled.

<blank>

I noticed that Dr. Joseline was nearby, opening her eyes and clapping her hands, saying "wow - wow - wow!

When the teacher told me to look to the side, I saw that Bibi had also successfully manifested his magic. But it must have taken a lot of concentration. Several beads of sweat were floating on her forehead. Then, as if relieved, she took a deep breath in and let it out in a long, long exhale.

But Bibi noticed my gaze immediately and raised the corner of her mouth! And then, she just kept on saying, "You did it! And then, "We did it, didn't we? and we both raised our right hands and clapped them together.

<blank>

Usually, it's not every girl who can do it once, but you two are amazing! You two are amazing.

<blank>

When I looked around again, it was clear that everyone was struggling. There are voices mumbling chants here and there, breathing deeply, and even a child using a breathing technique I don't understand, such as hiccups and hiccups. Hmmm, it's the first time for all of us, isn't it a struggle?

For the most part, if the "spirit magic" I had been using was an electric go-cart that could be driven simply by turning on and off the accelerator, this "direct magic" is a manually operated passenger car.

It's like a novice driver who over accelerates the accelerator pedal and over revs the engine, or fails to connect the clutch properly and stalls the car. It is only natural that everyone would have a hard time with this.

I don't know what would have happened if I had not trained with the branches and trees and had done it on the spur of the moment.

That being said, Bibi, who genuinely cleared it up in one go, is still awesome. ...... Yeah, it's really amazing! It's really amazing!

<blank>

Then suddenly a loud popping sound echoed through the room. Perhaps startled by the sound, several small screams were heard from the female students.

<blank>

There are one or two children who have so much magic power that they can't handle it, and they let it go out of control. Don't worry...there's nothing to worry about..."

<blank>

Dr. Joseline walks toward the sound, scratching her head with a troubled look on her face.

<blank>

Huh? Huh? Huh? ...... that?"

<blank>

The teacher walked away to find Mia sitting down helplessly on the floor, staring in dismay at the remains of the exploding tact lying on the floor and her hand smoking like a pus-pus-pus smoldering hand.



<blank>

----------------

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

I had to cut it down because it would have been a little too sad if I had kept Joseline's tone (laughs).

<blank>

Please wait a while until the next drop.
