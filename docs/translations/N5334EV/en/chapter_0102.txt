# Episode 90: Ether Seal

The day after the entrance ceremony, general classes have not yet started.

Today, we will first engrave the spirit seal. This was mentioned by our homeroom teacher, Miss Ursula Ruin, during the morning meeting.

<b>

From the podium, Miss Ursula, with her topknot bobbing left and right, instructed us to move quickly from the classroom.

We are to move to the adjacent Magical Technology Building.

As the teacher earnestly directed us to leave the classroom in order, we began to move, feeling a warm sense of comfort together.

Yes! There’s something soothing about busy Miss Ursula!

<b>

The engraving of the spirit seal will be done in order, starting with our first group.

<b>

“Since we have people waiting behind us, let’s move quickly!”

<b>

Miss Ursula’s voice urged us from behind, pushing us along.

<b>

Even though we say we are engraving, it’s not like we are getting a tattoo or doing anything physical; rather, we are said to be marking a 'seal' on our individual spiritual bodies.

Some classes will use magical tools, and above all, without the spirit seal, we cannot use 'direct magic.'

Having a spirit seal is essential for learning and mastering magical technology.

The entrance exam also included a written test for the 'Magical Skill Certification,' and during the magical power measurement, exceeding the required magical power value is a passing criterion. Therefore, passing the entrance exam means we are also successful candidates for the qualification test.

After this, once we engrave the spirit seal, we will officially be qualified as 'Level 4 Magic Practitioners'!

Finally, we will take a step up the ladder of adulthood! Yay!!

<b>

<b>

We were brought to a room in the Magical Technology Building.

Inside the classroom, there were about four young men and women, who prompted us to sit in the chairs lined up inside.

These individuals are university students called to assist with today’s classes.

In other words, they are our seniors. The kind-looking older brothers and sisters smiled at us, reassuring us that there was nothing to worry about as they guided us to our seats.

Once seated, I was handed something that felt nostalgic.

In my palms, I held two knuckle dusters!

<b>

Yes, these were the spirit investigation devices used in Professor Henry's temple. They were parts that came with it.

I remember sitting on the sofa holding something similar back then and having the device used on me...

<b>

“Please put your fingers through them and grip tightly! If your grip is weak, you might not be able to access the etheric body, so be careful!”

<b>

I see, these parts I’m holding are necessary for accessing the etheric body.

<b>

I can’t help but recall that time... I was a bit anxious about using the device, but Papa Howard was watching over me kindly, which made me feel reassured.

I remember how big and warm Papa’s hand was... Ugh! Oh no! I feel like crying...! Ugh... Stay calm, stay calm... Okay! I’m calm now; that was close!

<b>

“Let’s get started! Everyone, please relax and lean back in your chairs!”

<b>

As the teacher operated a device that looked like an equalizer mounted on the wall, warmth slowly spread from my fingers through the grip, and my entire body began to feel warm.

It felt just like that time. This must be the state where the device is accessing the etheric body.

<b>

However, that warmth quickly faded away.

Unlike when I used the spirit investigation device, this felt much more straightforward.

<b>

“Those who are finished, please move to the next room in order!”

<b>

Miss Ursula urged everyone to quickly move to the adjacent room.

The room we moved to felt more like a large preparation room than a classroom. Was it a storage room for magical tools? Various junk-like tools were carelessly placed on the desks or haphazardly arranged on the shelves.

There were also several shelves lined up like those in a library.

As we were guided to the rows of shelves at the back, the doors opened, revealing neatly arranged items inside. There were numerous small lantern-like magical tools crammed in there.

We were handed one of those magical tools by the teaching assistants present in this room.

<b>

“Please use that to check the operation of the spirit seal!”

<b>

<b>

From now on, we will use this magical tool to confirm the operation of the spirit seal after it has been engraved.

The confirmation doesn’t involve anything particularly difficult; we just need to activate the magical tool.

<b>

The tool is a small lantern that lights up just by touching it.

For now, we were told to simply repeat turning the light on and off.

This is how we will teach our spiritual bodies to recognize that the spirit seal is functioning.

<b>

If I place my hand on the bottom of the lantern, the light will turn on. Touch it again, and it will turn off. It’s like a touch sensor light.

Normally, the lantern should light up just by touching it, but some of them don’t light up on the first try.

<b>

“Even if it doesn’t light up immediately, please keep trying! As you repeat it, you’ll get used to it!”

<b>

Miss Ursula encouraged each of us, offering advice to those struggling to succeed.

<b>

“Hmm, Cloud, you’re doing fine! As expected! Please continue for a while longer.”

<b>

With her bobbing tail above her head, Miss Ursula moved away. Yes, she really is soothing.

<b>

<b>

“Oh, it lit up properly!”

“I did it! It lit up! It lit up continuously!!”

“Wow! Me too!”

<b>

After a while, such voices began to be heard from all around. It seems everyone is gradually getting the hang of it.

Yes, everyone looks happy. Some kids are even cheering.

Of course! With this, they can activate the magical tool by themselves and move it on their own. It’s like a proof that they’ve become independent, so it’s only natural to be excited!

Even I, despite how I look, am feeling quite pumped!

<b>

“Alright! Everyone seems to have gotten the hang of it, so let’s move to the next classroom! Please keep holding onto the magical tools you have! We need to move quickly so that the next group doesn’t get held up!”

<b>

It seems we are to take the lantern home and use the magical tool all day to get accustomed to the spirit seal.

I was told by one of the teaching assistants that it’s fine to keep using it until tomorrow, whether we chat or study, just as long as we keep using it throughout the day.

<b>

<b>

As we followed Miss Ursula out of the magical preparation room and down the hallway, we passed by the kids from the third group. They were probably heading to engrave their ether seals.

The kids from the third group curiously glanced at the lanterns we were holding, which we were turning on and off. Yes, it’s only natural that they would be interested.

Among that line, I spotted Karen. I waved my hand slightly, and she noticed me, smiling and waving back.

Feeling unexpectedly happy and warm, I then locked eyes with the countess's daughter from yesterday, who was nearby. Speaking of which, Karen was in the same third group as this noble girl.

I smiled at the noble girl as a greeting, and she seemed to be about to say something as she turned her body toward me.

At that moment, one of the attendants who had been with the noble girl quickly reacted, turning her around and back into the flow of the line.

That girl also quickly bowed her head and returned to the line.

Hmm, I feel like I just saw a shadow of someone who has had a hard time in her current situation.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Alright, everyone! I am Joseline Joslan, the teacher in charge of magical practical training. Nice to meet you!”

<b>

In the next classroom, another teacher was waiting.

She looked about the same age as us, but being a half-elf, her actual age seems to differ from her appearance.

But wait? I feel like I’ve seen this teacher somewhere before... Where was it? I don’t think I saw her at the entrance ceremony...

Maybe she was there during the entrance exam?

<b>

The classroom we were brought to was considerably smaller compared to the ones we had seen so far. There were no desks, just chairs lined up.

No, it didn’t feel like a classroom at all. It was more like a “briefing room” that you see in movies, where pilots receive mission briefings before deployment. The teacher stood not at the front but at a small desk to the right diagonal in front of us, as if preparing to lower a screen for a presentation. Thinking of it that way, I felt a strange excitement!

<b>

“First, I will give a simple basic explanation for activating magic... Ah, this will be the first magic lecture since entering school, I suppose?”

<b>

Ignoring my excitement, Miss Joseline began to give the first magic lecture at this school in a rather drawn-out tone.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

What is magic, once again?

Magic is the supernatural skill of inserting information into an orderly material world to create phenomena that cannot occur there.

<b>

Normally, one cannot suddenly generate fire in an empty space before them.

While it’s possible to suggest several possibilities, such as the presence of combustible gas or heat concentration at a specific point due to radiant heat, in a space where none of these elements exist, fire cannot occur.

<b>

Similarly, in this closed space, if nothing is done, wind will not arise.

Moreover, air will not flow from one side to the other, nor will pressure differences arise within it.

<b>

Furthermore, water dislikes high places and prefers to flow to low places.

It will not create a flow from low to high. If something is thrown into the water, objects with a greater specific gravity than water will sink to the bottom.

<b>

And here, we have just an egg. It’s a boiled egg served for breakfast. I will enjoy it later.

... But what happens if I let go of this egg as it is? It will fall to the floor. That is the natural order.

However! Will it stay here without falling to the floor, waiting for me to enjoy it?

Or perhaps, if I drop it, even if it hits the granite floor, the shell won’t break, and instead, the floor will break... Such an absurd thing cannot happen, right?

In reality, the egg will break, spilling its contents, and I will suffer the tragedy of missing out on the boiled egg I had been looking forward to in an instant.

And I can vividly imagine the future where Miss Ursula kicks me for making a mess on the floor! (I won’t do that!)

<b>

This is all a matter of course. It’s a natural phenomenon.

<b>

However, causing impossible phenomena to occur in such an ordinary reality is what “magic” is.

This is made possible by rewriting the information content of the ether, a semi-spiritual, semi-material latent existence that encompasses the information of the manifest material world.

“Spirit magic” is a method where the practitioner orders the spirit, which is an etheric existence, and provides magical power to manifest phenomena.

Since the manifestation of phenomena is entrusted to the spirit, it can be used easily, but in terms of magical power efficiency, one must provide a large amount of magical power to the spirit, so it cannot be said to be efficient. Additionally, fine adjustments and applications of magic are also quite difficult.

<b>

On the other hand, the “direct magic” that you will learn from now on is a method of directly connecting to etheric information through the “spirit seal” you just engraved to create phenomena. While the difficulty of learning and using magic increases significantly compared to “spirit magic,” the adjustments and customizations of magic can be greatly expanded depending on the practitioner’s proficiency. I believe this is a technique that becomes deeper the more one learns.

<b>

<b>

Now, to learn that magic, you must first extract magical information from the spirit quality archive.

The spirit quality archive is a repository artificially created on the surface of the Akasha, containing a wealth of magical information.

Those who possess a spirit seal will gain access to the archive and be able to read that information.

The depth of access to the archive is limited by the rank of the spirit seal, so if you want to access deeper information, please work hard to raise your rank.

<b>

To use magic, you must first read the magical information you want to use from this archive and record it in your etheric body.

The magical information recorded in your etheric body is called a “spiritual channel.”

By channeling magical power through this spiritual channel, magic is manifested.

<b>

The manifestation of magic is executed when the “chanting” flows magical power into the spiritual channel.

At first, even the thinnest spiritual channels will grow thicker as magic is repeatedly used, allowing magical power to flow through them.

Once the spiritual channel thickens, magic can be manifested with a short chant. Furthermore, with proficiency, it becomes possible to manifest magic without chanting.

<b>

Magic is not something that anyone can master immediately after learning it.

Please remember that magic is a skill that requires training.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

Miss Joseline’s magic lecture was generally about this content.

The lecture, projected onto the front wall, felt just like a “briefing room explanation,” and I kept my excitement to myself!

<b>

After the lecture, one by one, we went to the front to “learn magic.”

A “magic book” is used for learning magic.

Even though it’s called a “book,” it wasn’t made of paper pages.

It was made of two boards bound together, designed to open like a book. It was about the size of B4, with dense text on one side and patterns resembling magic circles on the other.

The patterns... or rather, they were engraved. The engraved text and patterns were filled with brightly colored paint, and just looking at it gave me the same thrill as viewing a beautiful picture book. It was a bit of a craftwork, wasn’t it?

When my turn came, I got to touch it, but it wasn’t made of wood. It felt more like ceramic or pottery. Yes, it was a mysterious crafted material.

When I placed my palm on the magic circle of the “magic book,” guided by Miss Ursula, the channel opened, and magical information was transferred to our etheric bodies through the spirit seal.

This “magic book” itself does not record magic; it is merely an authentication key to access specific magical information within the spirit quality archive.

So, it is said that there is a “magic book” for each magic.

When learning magic, one must have the corresponding “magic book” and, as we just did, do so under the supervision and approval of the “guide.”

<b>

For now, those who have finished learning magic were told to move to the next room in order.

The next room was much larger than the “briefing room” we had just been in. It resembled an indoor shooting range.

Here, we were to test the activation of the magic we had just learned.

The magic we learned was “Magical Barrier.” It’s a simple magic that gathers magical power at the tip of a raised hand to deploy a defensive shield.

<b>

“Concentrate the magical power—converge and release the magical power—this magic will allow you to learn the basic magical power manipulation and magical pathways necessary for using magic.”

<b>

After the lecture, while waiting for the students to learn magic, Miss Joseline moved to this room and began to instruct the students who had completed their learning in activating the magic.

<b>

“First, please ensure you have a clear chant to reliably manifest the magic.”

<b>

“At first, it’s important to be aware of the rhythm of the words and the pitch of the sounds.”

<b>

“Today, even just being able to feel the flow of magical power is a great achievement. Please don’t push yourselves too hard.”

<b>

“In the past, to use magic, one had to meditate and access the universal unconscious, which involved a lot of tedious procedures, but thanks to the establishment of ether technology nowadays, it has become this easy, which is quite a blessing.”

<b>

Miss Joseline spoke while observing each student. I decided to try activating the magic right away!

<b>

“Essence of spirit, with the principle of words, protect me with the source of power. 《Magical Barrier》”

<b>

Since it’s a basic magic, the “chant” is quite short.

As I chanted, I felt a flow of magical power within my body that I had never felt before.

It was an indescribable sensation, like blood flowing through newly formed blood vessels for the first time.

Instead of sending a large amount of magical power through this newly formed pathway, I carefully adjusted the flow of magical power. Like dripping water from a tissue... gently, finely, and delicately...

<b>

This feels similar to the training I did before, flowing “Qi” into branches delicately!

If I misadjusted and sent too much “Qi,” the branch would burst immediately, but I don’t think I’ll burst my arm from sending too much magical power... I’ll be extra careful while channeling the magical power...

<b>

Gradually, I could feel the magical power forming a circuit-like pathway. After that, I just needed to create an exit for it, and the magic should manifest.

The teacher said it would be good to create the exit at the tip of the raised staff for easier visualization.

Once I get used to it, I could create exits anywhere, whether at my fingertips, elbows, or soles of my feet.

It’s important to recognize the image of magic manifestation as a tangible reality, not just an image. Hmm, this way of thinking is also close to the teachings of “Qi.” I find it easy to understand, which is helpful. The people at Amukamu, who teach “Qi,” will probably grasp this feeling quickly too!

<b>

As I exhaled quietly, expanding the magical power to emerge from the tip of the staff, I felt the “Magical Barrier” complete.

I felt a massive round shield large enough to completely hide my body form at the tip of the raised staff.

<b>

“Oh, oh! Did Miss Kuroki and Miss Cloud already complete it? At first, it’s usually quite difficult to channel magical power through this thin spiritual channel, and one often struggles and suffers greatly... But your magical control is impressive!”

<b>

Before I knew it, Miss Joseline was nearby, amazed and clapping her hands.

When I looked over at her, I saw that Vivi had also successfully manifested her magic. However, it must have required considerable concentration. Beads of sweat were forming on her forehead. Then, with a relieved expression, she took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.

But as soon as Vivi noticed my gaze, she grinned widely. Then, she raised her right hand, and we high-fived each other in celebration.

<b>

“Normally, it’s rare for anyone to succeed on the first try. You both are amazing!”

<b>

Looking around again, it was clear that everyone else was struggling. I could hear murmurs of chants, deep breaths, and even some kids using strange breathing techniques like “Hihihuff.” Well, everyone is doing something for the first time, so it’s only natural to struggle.

Generally speaking, if the “spirit magic” we had been using until now was like an electric go-kart that could be controlled by simply turning the accelerator on and off, then this “direct magic” is like a manual car.

It’s like a beginner driver who presses the accelerator too hard, revving the engine unnecessarily, or fails to engage the clutch properly, causing the car to stall. It’s understandable that everyone is having a hard time.

I can’t imagine what would have happened if I hadn’t practiced with the branches and had just jumped straight into this.

Thinking about it, Vivi, who cleared it purely on the first try, is truly impressive... Yes! She’s really amazing!!

<b>

Suddenly, a loud explosion echoed through the room. Startled by the sound, several female students let out small screams.

<b>

“Oh no, did someone mess up? There’s usually one or two who have too much magical power and can’t control it, causing them to have an outburst. Don’t worry; there’s nothing to be concerned about!”

<b>

Miss Joseline scratched her head with a troubled expression as she walked toward the source of the sound.

<b>

“Huh? What? ... Huh?”

<b>

What Miss Joseline found was Mia, sitting weakly on the floor, staring blankly at the remnants of a broken staff that had rolled onto the ground, with smoke rising from her hands.

<b>

----------------

Thank you for always reading!

<b>

I shortened Miss Joseline’s speech a bit because it was a bit too much to handle (laughs).

<b>

Please give me some time until the next update (^^;
