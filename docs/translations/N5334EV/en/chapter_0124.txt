# Chapter 112: The Villainous Noble Lady Appears?!

Alma-san told me to let Karen leave early because today must have been tough for her.

Furthermore, since the number of visitors has settled down, she said it would be worrisome to let Karen go home alone, so we could all leave together...

With that, we left the shop over an hour earlier than usual and headed home together.

<b>

As we walked through the town on our way back to the academy, Karen told me that the people from today were two seniors from the school she attended.

I asked if they were local seniors, but she said that wasn't the case.

<b>

Huh? What does that mean?

<b>

<b>

Karen's hometown is Munanotos.

I had heard from my uncle that Munanotos has been facing various misfortunes, and its municipal management has been in a terrible state for several years now.

<b>

After a major accident in Munanotos, the population naturally decreased, leading to a downward spiral in municipal revenue.

As expected, the budget for welfare also decreased, and many personnel had to be let go.

<b>

<b>

Karen, who had aptitude for two attributes since that time, was naturally expected by those around her to advance to Miriacastle Academy. However, there were no instructors available in Munanotos to guide her, and she was in a situation where even the funds for further education were out of reach, so she had given up on attending the academy.

<b>

"The one who helped me during that time was Uncle Lawrence," Karen said.

<b>

The head of Gruusmil, Lawrence Niven.

I've been hearing that name quite often lately.

<b>

Mr. Lawrence is known for his remarkable achievements and is also the chairman of the Affitrina Trading Company, which has been soaring in success.

My uncle mentioned that the growth of that trading company has been particularly remarkable in the last four to five years.

<b>

Karen's deep trust in Mr. Lawrence is evident from the way she speaks about him.

Mr. Lawrence, who offered support to Karen, believed it would be a shame to let her talent, possessing two attributes, go to waste. He arranged for her to attend Gruusmil's school, where she could receive magical instruction to prepare for further education.

<b>

The two people from earlier are upperclassmen from that Gruusmil school, so Karen says they are somewhat different from being locals.

<b>

More Gruusmil, huh...

<b>

Due to the recent foolishness of the people from there, my impression of Gruusmil has become quite negative.

<b>

With the resolution of the duel incident with Irvin, the decision was made that "Rayleigh Niven must not get involved with Irvin Haggard."

<b>

I really wanted it to be a decision like "Don't get involved with Amukam and its affiliates!" However, a "duel" is limited to "individual" versus "individual," so they cannot make decisions that affect groups.

If you want to influence many people, it seems you have to do it through "group battles."

But, Colin said that the academy wouldn't allow such a thing.

"It would definitely just turn into a massacre," Kara said. Such an obvious tragedy wouldn't be permitted from a humanitarian perspective, Jessica added.

What’s that? Humanitarian perspective?!

<b>

Well, with all that said, I didn't really have any intention of actively getting involved with the people from Gruusmil, but the more I listened to Karen's story, the more it felt like mere information gathering wouldn't suffice. Mainly, it felt like a personal instinct or premonition?

<b>

As we were having that conversation and thinking about such things while walking through the town towards the academy, someone called out to us.

<b>

"Hey! Wait a minute!"

<b>

They appeared suddenly, blocking our path... or at least that’s what they probably thought!

Well, Karen was surprised.

Of course, it was obvious to me, Mia, and Bibi that these guys were surrounding us.

If they were leaking such an ominous presence around them, it would be hard not to notice. Even the passersby were avoiding them.

<b>

In front of us were the DQN couple who had come to the shop today.

Furthermore, several people gathered around them, surrounding us. Hmm, about ten people including the foolish couple?

<b>

After the men surrounded us to prevent our escape, a flashy guy pulled out a knife from his pants pocket, brandishing it while saying, "Come here," and gesturing with his chin.

The knife he pulled out made a sound like "shakoon!" as the blade extended.

Is that a butterfly knife? They have those in this world too.

But the blade is small!

<b>

It's probably not even half the size of the blade of the slow-in knife strapped to my lovely thigh!

No, of course, I won't be taking out anything in response.

<b>

Well, this... is probably meant to intimidate us.

There's no need to comply with everything they say... but well, I’ll decide to go along quietly.

<b>

I raised my hand slightly and urged Bibi and Mia, who were about to enter a fighting stance, to follow along.

<b>

Karen is... quite calm.

<b>

From an ordinary person's perspective, she is surrounded by quite a number of people, so I thought she might feel somewhat pressured, but she shows no signs of that at all.

She walks along confidently with us.

<b>

By the way, her way of moving is almost like that of a martial artist?!

It's as if she's ready to engage right now... I can even feel the spirit of someone who could take on ten opponents!

The intensity and excitement she displays are so different from her usual self!

<b>

Ah, but when she's running or moving her body, is it close to this atmosphere?

Looking at what happened in the alley this morning, it seems she is surprisingly okay with rough situations? If it’s against thugs, does her fighting spirit rise?

<b>

But when it comes to that DQN or that Niven's kid, she seems to shrink quite a bit...

Hmm, I don't get it!

<b>

<b>

While I was thinking about such things, it seemed we had arrived at our destination.

<b>

It was a construction site located a couple of streets back from the main road.

The building was covered with a large cloth like a tent, and there were piles of bricks and building materials stacked in front of it.

<b>

Is this the site where Irvin and Lombard said they went on the first day of their union work?

Since today is a holiday, it seems there are no workers at the site.

Well, that’s probably why they brought us here!

<b>

At the entrance to the site, two men, looking like thugs, lifted the tent flap and guided us inside.

<b>

We were brought into a room inside the building.

The walls had many areas where the plaster had not been applied, and bricks were exposed here and there. It was clear that construction was ongoing.

Materials for the interior were also piled up all over the floor.

It's quite a spacious room. I wonder if it will be used as a dining hall or a conference room?

<b>

Well, it doesn't really matter what it will be used for. The important thing is that it’s big enough for about 14 to 15 people, including us and the DQN.

Places like back alleys, ruins, abandoned buildings, and construction sites are classic spots for thugs to use for extortion or fights!

<b>

"Hey, Parker! That's a student from Miriacastle! Are you really allowed to do this?!"

"Hah! If you're scared, just go home!"

"Idiot! She's from Miriacastle?! There's no way I'm letting this opportunity slip by!!"

"Wow, they really have some good catches here."

"Man, look at that size!"

<b>

Yes! Out――!!

<b>

Well! Bringing a girl to a place like this and surrounding her with more than ten men is already a crime, right? That’s guilty, right?!

Alright! Arrest! Arrest!! Blue〇a! Secureーー!

<b>

While I was getting motivated like that, Bibi gently grabbed my arm from behind and whispered softly in my ear.

<b>

"You do realize this is in the middle of town, right? It's not in the forest, you know?!"

"…I-I know, okay?"

<b>

I turned my neck toward Bibi with a creaking sound, but I couldn't direct my gaze toward her, looking elsewhere instead.

<b>

"You think no matter how strange your techniques are, you can do anything with this many people?!!"

<b>

Oh? The guys who came to the shop are starting to yell about something. Is he talking to me?

How rude! That strange technique is just a joint lock!

<b>

"You were acting pretty cocky earlier, weren't you?! Huh?!"

<b>

The thug started to get even more worked up.

Did he forget that he was trembling when he left the shop? I guess he felt emboldened by bringing a large group with him.

It seems some of the guys who were at the entrance outside were already in this room, so there are about 15 of them including this guy.

The cabaret girl is glaring at us from behind them.

<b>

A total of 16 people.

Well, I guess it makes sense that he feels emboldened.

<b>

"What’s Miriacastle?! Just because you can use a bit of magic, don’t act all high and mighty! Get lost!!"

<b>

The thugs each pulled out their weapons, closing in to leave us no escape.

Each of them was holding iron rods or knives, but they were all shabby-looking blades.

<b>

They probably think showing their weapons will intimidate us.

But that won't work on the kids from Amukam, you know?

<b>

So don’t smirk, don’t underestimate the blades! You should at least take care of your weapons!

That’s why they give off such a "loser" vibe!

<b>

<b>

"Hey, Karen! Just because you got into Miriacastle, don’t think you can act all high and mighty?! Huh?!"

"Th-That Parker... I didn’t mean to...!"

<b>

"Yeah! No matter where you go, you're still trash!!"

"Katya, don’t say that...!"

<b>

"Karen! Don’t get cocky! I’ll make you crawl and apologize for making a fool of me!! Gahaha!!"

<b>

"Shut up, all of you."

<b>

I can't stand the insults directed at Karen!

I originally intended to lure them all in and take them down, but I won't allow them to insult Karen.

I stepped in between them and Karen, blocking the unpleasant noise.

<b>

Karen is also acting strangely. The fierce spirit she had before vanished just from being intimidated by those two, and she returned to being a timid girl.

...Is there something going on?

<b>

"Y-You... You bastard!! Don’t mess with me! I’ll make you pay for this! Get ready, you bastard!!"

<b>

"I told you to shut up."

<b>

I took another step forward.

Then, I lightly brought my palms together at my chest.

<b>

Bibi and Mia, who understood my intention, immediately began to move right behind me.

Mia quickly went behind Karen and covered her ears with her hands.

Karen looked surprised by Mia's sudden action. Well, that's only natural.

<b>

Bibi also quickly deployed a field magic.

It was "Air Wall," which creates a wall of air.

<b>

This isn't as advanced as the "Acoustic Wall" that Alma-san used in the shop, but it is still a "wind" attribute magic.

You could say it's like an air curtain?

Bibi deployed that wall of air between us and them.

<b>

Then, I gently rubbed my palms together before clapping my hands.

This is what is known as a "kashiwade."

I infused "ki" into my palms, and then added a pinch of magical power to the sound.

<b>

PAAAAAAAN!!!

The sound of my clap echoed loudly in the room and reverberated off the walls.

<b>

This is a technique I often used as an emergency measure when children were surrounded by many magical beasts in the shallow layers of the forest.

The sound of the clap shakes the brains of the magical beasts, stopping their movements. In that moment, I would help the children regain their stance.

<b>

When I used it, I would usually have everyone cover their ears, so there weren't any particular issues. Well, it's a bit like a sound wave weapon.

However, there were low-level magical beasts with a threat level of 1 who would sometimes explode their heads if they were directly hit by the sound's reverberation.

<b>

Of course! This time, I adjusted it enough so that wouldn’t happen! ...I hope.

Probably!!

<b>

"Gugya!" "Gyabu!" "Gegyu!" "Boaka!"

<b>

The wave of sound from my clap shook the semicircular canals and brains of the thugs.

They let out strange voices like goblins and began to topple over one after another.

<b>

More than half of them have lost consciousness.

The rest are crumbling like they're drunk and can't even stand.

<b>

Whoa! There are some who are throwing up and others who are wetting themselves?

Even after adjusting it this much, they’re in this state?

How fragile are these guys? Gross, don’t come near me!

<b>

"What?… G-What the 'Bakya'?!"

"Eh? Uah… What? 'Gokin' Gofu?!"

"What, what, ueh… Ch-Chiku, 'Bakiboki' Gyaa!!"

<b>

Bibi and Mia are swiftly taking down the remaining conscious ones one by one.

Wow, Mia just silently stomped on the wrist of a guy still holding a knife, then kicked him in the head, knocking him out.

<b>

As always, that's brutal.

Well, the people from Amukam really show no mercy to those who oppose them.

Karen seems to be turning pale and is taken aback.

<b>

In an instant, the interior of the construction site turned into a scene of goblin extermination.

There are corpses everywhere.

<b>

Among them, there are still some who are conscious. Well, I made sure to adjust it for them!

<b>

"W-What is this? I-I can’t stand... C-Crap, my head is spinning... Ugh."

"H-Hiyu... Ugh! Uo, op! Uoeeeee!"

<b>

Today, it’s the DQN couple who acted tough with Karen at the shop.

The guy is conscious but panicking, not understanding what happened.

The cabaret girl is... wow, she’s really throwing up a lot.

<b>

"You were hit by my magical power. I added a little to that, you know?"

<b>

Bibi said that to me.

I did add a bit, but come on, it was just a tiny bit, right?

<b>

"This guy seemed to be able to handle a little bit of magical power. If he suddenly gets hit with your inhuman amount of magical power, this is what happens!"

<b>

How rude, calling it inhuman!

Bibi just said something terrible! Well, I don't care right now.

<b>

"W-What... What is this, An... Ugh! Uoeeeee!"

<b>

No good, it seems the cabaret girl can't talk. I’ll leave her be.

<b>

But what should I do? Right after leaving the shop, they gathered so many people and attacked us; this is clearly a thug group, right?

Leaving them unchecked like this, what would happen?

Well, ultimately, I’ll hand these attempted rapists over to the guards!

<b>

But the problem is that there are people like this in the middle of town! The danger that they could pop up anywhere!

What if Karen or those twin girls get attacked next time?! 

<b>

I think the quickest and right answer would be to disinfect this area and clear it out!

Well, I won’t actually do that!

So, Beatrice, please stop glaring at me with that look!

<b>

So, let’s think a bit.

At least, I should make sure they don’t focus on Karen.

I’ll act in a way that the hate gathers on me.

<b>

So I stood beside the squirming thug and called down from above.

<b>

"Now then, let’s have a little chat, shall we?"

"What, what, what the hell? W-What is this... Gyaff!"

<b>

Since he was crawling and trying to escape, it was annoying, so I stepped on his shoulder to pin him down.

Hmm, this way, even if he looks up, it's fine! I can maintain a position that he can't peek from! This is the refinement of a lady!

<b>

"I don’t know what you all intend to do by harassing this girl, but..."

<b>

I imagined Lady Carrie. That overwhelming aura she exudes.

<b>

"She is my precious friend. I have no intention of letting anyone harm her... at all!"

<b>

Then, I channeled Lady Cordelia's haughty way of speaking.

<b>

"However, if you still claim to act unlawfully, then come at me anytime."

<b>

I lightly brushed my hair off my shoulder with one hand and cast a cold gaze at the thug squirming at my feet.

<b>

"This is Amukam's Suzy Cloud, and I will gladly take you on anytime... you know!"

<b>

How was that? Did I manage to gather some hate like a villainous noble lady?
