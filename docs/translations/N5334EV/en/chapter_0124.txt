# 112 - The Villainess Appears?

Alma told me to send Karen home early because she had a hard day.

Furthermore, the number of visitors had settled down, and we were worried about letting Karen go home alone, so we told her that we could go up with her .......

So we were allowed to leave the restaurant more than an hour earlier than usual and headed home together.

<blank>

On the way back through town to the school, Karen told me that today's group was two students one grade above her from the school she attended.

Does that mean he's a local senior? I asked him, but he said that was not the case.

<blank>

Yeah? - Yeah. What do you mean?

<blank>

<blank>

Karen's hometown is Munanotos.

My uncle had told me that Munanotos had been suffering from a series of unfortunate events, and that the municipality had been in a very bad state for several years.

<blank>

After the major accident in Munanotos, the population naturally decreased, and the municipality's income was in a negative spiral, with a steady decline accelerating.

As a matter of course, the budget for welfare and other services has been reduced, and a lot of human resources have also been let go.

<blank>

<blank>

Karen, who had the aptitude for both attributes from that time, was expected to go on to Milia Castel Eye as a matter of course. However, there was no one in Munanotos to guide her, and she was unable to even finance her entrance into the school, so she gave up on the idea of entering the school.

<blank>

It was my Uncle Lawrence who helped me through that time.

<blank>

Karen says.

<blank>

Lawrence Niven, head of Grouse Mill.

I hear that name often here.

<blank>

Mr. Lawrence says he is also the commercial chairman of the Great Aphitrina Chamber of Commerce, which is now known for its flying record of success.

The Kano Chamber of Commerce has grown tremendously, especially in the last four to five years, said my uncle.

<blank>

Karen's trust in Mr. Lawrence is evident in every word she says.

<blank>

Mr. Lawrence, who offered his support to Karen, felt that it would be a shame to bury her dual-attribute talent, so he arranged for her to attend a school in Grouse Mill that offers instruction in magic so that she could study for higher education.

<blank>

Karen says the two men are upperclassmen at that Grouse Mill school, so they are a little different from the locals.

<blank>

Another Grouse Mill. ......

<blank>

I have a very bad impression of Grouse Mill because of these idiots.

<blank>

With the settlement of the dueling fiasco with Irving in the example, the decision was made that 'Reilly Niven should not be involved with Irving Haggard.

<blank>

If it were true, I would have wanted the decision to be, 'Don't get involved with Amcam and its associates!' I would have preferred that the decision would have been, "Don't get involved with AMCAM and its associates! However, I heard that a "duel" is limited to "individual" versus "individual," so it is not possible to make a decision that affects the group.

If they want to influence many people, they have to do it in a 'group battle.

But the academy would not give permission for such a thing, Colin said.

Kara said, "It's all about annihilation, no matter how you look at it." Jessica further told me that such an obvious tragedy would not be permitted from a humanitarian standpoint.

What? What do you mean from a humanitarian standpoint?

<blank>

Well, I had no intention of getting actively involved with the people of Grouse Mill, but the more I heard Karen's story, the more I had a feeling that it would take more than just gathering information. Mainly my mood and premonition?

<blank>

As we were walking through the town toward the school, thinking about such a conversation, someone approached us.

<blank>

Oi! Wait a minute."

<blank>

They probably think they are ...... suddenly appearing to block our path, from their point of view!

Well, Karen was surprised.

Well, as a matter of course, it was obvious to me, Mia, and Bibi that these guys were surrounding us.

Of course, if you are leaking so many disturbing signs around you, people will notice. Even the passersby around you are avoiding you.

<blank>

In front of me was a DQN couple who had come to the store today.

Furthermore, several people gather around them. Hmmm, about 10 people including a couple of bachelors?

<blank>

After the men surrounded us to keep us from escaping, the charlatan pulled a knife out of his pants pocket, flashed it at us, and shook his chin, saying, "Come here.

The knife out of his pocket, Shakon! and the blade was out.

Butterfly knife? There are butterfly knives in this world, aren't there?

But the blade is tiny!

<blank>

It's probably not even half the size of the throw-in knife blade strapped to my beautiful thigh.

No, of course I wouldn't take it out against you, would I?

<blank>

Well, I guess this is supposed to be a ...... threat.

I don't have to do everything you say. ...... Well, I'll just go along with you like a big boy.

<blank>

He quickly raised his hand and urged Bibi and Mia, who were about to get into a fighting stance, to follow him.

<blank>

Karen is pretty calm at .......

<blank>

I thought they might be a bit intimidated by the fact that they were surrounded by so many people, but I didn't see any sign of that.

They look magnificent and are following along.

<blank>

I mean, your footsteps, you look like a martial artist?

I can deal with as many ......10 people as you want to stand up right now! I can even feel the spirit of "I'm willing to take on any number of people!

You can see the same enthusiasm and exuberance in Karen as you would normally see in the same person!

<blank>

Oh, but when you're running and moving your body, is that similar to the mood you're in now?

After what happened in the alleyway this morning, are you surprisingly okay with rough stuff? If you're dealing with someone who looks like a thug, does that make you more of a fighter?

<blank>

But with the DQN there and that niven child son of a son, it looks like he's going to delegate a lot. ......

Hmmm, wakaran!

<blank>

<blank>

And while I was thinking about that, I seemed to have reached my destination.

<blank>

It was a construction site, just a block or two back from the street. I guess?

The building is covered with a big cloth like a canopy, and several piles of bricks and other building materials are placed in front of it.

<blank>

I wonder if this is the kind of site that Irvin and Lombardo said they went to on their first day of union work.

Today is a holiday, so the laborers working at the site do not seem to be there.

Well, I guess that's why I brought him here!

<blank>

Is this the entrance to the site? Two men, who looked like fellow hoodlums, turned up the top like the entrance to a tent and led us in.

<blank>

I was brought to a room in a building.

The walls are not plastered in many areas and there are exposed bricks here and there. You can clearly see that it is under construction.

Materials for the interior were also piled here and there on the floor.

It's a pretty big room. I wonder if it will be used as a cafeteria or conference room?

<blank>

Well, it doesn't matter what it is used for. The point is that the room is big enough for 14 to 5 people, including us and the DQNers.

Back alleys, abandoned buildings, abandoned buildings, and the inside of construction sites like this are all classic places for people to use for extortion and fights!

<blank>

Oh, hey Parker! Hey, Parker! I'm a student in Milia! Are you sure you're okay with this?

"Ha! If you're scared, just go home!"

Barka! She's Milia's girl! I'm not gonna let an opportunity like this pass me by!

Oh, man, we've got the best balls in the house.

I can't get enough of it! Look at the size of that thing!"

<blank>

Yes, sir! Out--!

<blank>

Well, yeah! Bringing a girl into a place like this and surrounding her with 10 or more guys is a crime in itself, right? Guilty, right?

Alright! Arrests, arrests! Ao0a! Secureーー!

<blank>

I was ready to get laid when Bibi gently grabbed my arm from behind and pulled me to my feet, whispering in my ear.

<blank>

You know we're in the city, right? You know we're not in the woods, right?

"......, I know, shhh?"

<blank>

Gigigigig ...... and turned his head to Bibi, but his gaze was not directed to that side, but the direction of the day after tomorrow.

<blank>

I don't care how many of you can do some crazy tricks, there's no way you'll be able to do it with this many people around!

<blank>

Hmm? The guy who came to the store has started yelling something. Is he talking to me?

It's rude to call it a weird technique! That thing was just mastering a joint.

<blank>

You were so lickety-split just now, weren't you? Aaah!

<blank>

The people started to get even more icky.

Remember how gawky he was when we left the restaurant? I knew he must have been a bit preoccupied with the many friends he had in tow.

The guy at the outside entrance and some others were in this room from the beginning, so there were 15 people including this guy.

The cabaret girl is behind her, glaring at Koch as hard as she can.

<blank>

16 in all.

That's a good thing, right?

<blank>

What's with you, Miria? Don't act all high and mighty just because you can do a little magic! Gorrah!

<blank>

The men took out their weapons and closed in on us so that there was nowhere for us to run.

They all have iron bars and knives in their hands, but all of them are poor blades.

<blank>

They probably think that showing them a knife will scare them off.

But that's not going to get through to the AmCam kids, okay?

<blank>

So don't grin, don't lick the blade! Think about taking care of your gains a little!

That's why I'm feeling like a beaten-down character all over again!

<blank>

<blank>

"Hey Karen! You're getting a little carried away just because you're in Milia, aren't you? Aaah!

"Oh, no, that's not how Parker ......, I ......, I didn't mean it ......."

<blank>

Yes, you're right! Wherever you go, you're still a scumbag!"

Katia such ...... such."

<blank>

Kareennnnn! Don't you dare take a lick of me! Hey! I'll make you crawl in my lap and put a rock in your throat to make up for my licking! Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

Shut the fuck up already."

<blank>

I can't stand to hear the rhetoric of these people towards Karen!

I originally took the invitation with the intention of rounding them up, but I don't recall allowing Karen to insult me.

I got between them and Karen and blocked out the unpleasant noise.

<blank>

Karen is also strange. The spirit that she had had up until now was erased just by the two men, and she reverted to being a timid child.

...... What's this about?

<blank>

Teh, teh ...... teh! Fuck you! Fuck you! Don't lick me! I'm going to make you pay for this! I'm gonna make you pay for this!

<blank>

I said shut up."

<blank>

I take one more step forward.

Then, he put his own two palms lightly together on his chest.

<blank>

Bibi and Mia, sensing my intention, start moving right behind me.

Mia quickly got behind Karen and covered Karen's ears with her hands.

Karen looks surprised at Mia's sudden behavior. Well, it's natural, isn't it?

<blank>

Bibi also immediately deployed field magic.

It is an "air wall" that creates a wall of air.

<blank>

This is not as advanced as the "Acoustic Wall" that Alma used at the store, but it is still a "wind" magic.

It's like an air curtain, if you will.

Bibi deployed that wall of air between me and ourselves.

<blank>

I rubbed my palms together lightly, and then I slowly clapped my hands together.

It is what is called an oak hand.

The palm is filled with "Ki" and the sound has a little ...... bit of magical power.

<blank>

Pahhhhhh!

and the sound of my oak hand echoes loudly through the room and reverberates off the walls.

<blank>

This is a technique I often used as an emergency measure when children were caught off guard by a large number of magical beasts in the shallow forest layer.

The echoing of the oak hands shook the brain plasma of the magical beasts and stopped their movements. In the meantime, the children were being readied.

<blank>

When I used it, I had everyone's ears covered on the spur of the moment, so there's no particular problem. Well, it's a bit of a sonic weapon.

However, with low-ranked magical beasts with a threat value of less than 1, some of them would blow their craniums out if they were exposed to the reverberation of the sound.

<blank>

Of course! This time it's something that's been sufficiently adjusted so it won't be that way! It should be .......

Maybe!

<blank>

Ggah! Ggabu! Ggagyu! Boo-hoo!

<blank>

The waves of oak hands reverberating in the room shook the seminarians' semicircular canals and brain plasma.

The others, raising their curious, goblin-like voices, kept pulling back one after the other.

<blank>

More than half of you are also unconscious.

The rest of them, too, are so shattered, they can't even stand up, like they're drunk.

<blank>

Wow! Some of them are throwing up and some are incontinent.

Is this the state of affairs after all this addition and subtraction?

How fragile are these guys? I don't like them, so don't go near them!

<blank>

Ue?" ......gee, what 'baca' gab!"

What? Oh ......? Gokin' gosh!"

"Nah, nah, oooh......... chi-chi, chiku, 'bakiboki' gah! Gah!

<blank>

Bibi and Mia reap the consciousness of those who are still barely able to move, one after another.

Wow, now Mia, still holding the knife, silently stomped down on the wrist of the guy who pointed the tip at her. She then kicked him in the head, knocking him unconscious.

<blank>

It's still egregious.

Well, the people of AMCAM are really not at all wholeheartedly merciful to those who oppose them.

Karen is also looking a bit pale and don't you think?

<blank>

In an instant, the interior of the construction site looked like the site of a goblin hive extermination.

There are many corpses.

<blank>

In the midst of all this, there are those who are still conscious. Well, I was consciously giving and taking to those guys!

<blank>

What's this? I can't stand up. ...... Shit, shit, my eyes, my eyes are rolling. ......

'Hi, hi ...... ugh! Ooooh, opu! Ooooh yeah!"

<blank>

They are a DQN couple, a senior and a cabaret girl, who came to the store today to make out with Karen.

The man is conscious, but somewhat panicked because he doesn't know what happened.

Cavanaugh's daughter is ......, wow, that's some grandiose kerfuffle.

<blank>

You've got me under your spell. You put a little bit of it on that thing, didn't you?"

<blank>

Bibi told me that.

I did put it on the site, but.... But it's really just a little bit, right?

<blank>

 If she was suddenly exposed to an inhuman amount of your magic power, this is what she would do!

<blank>

Heck, they said it's not human!

Bibi told me that I was being awful! Well, it doesn't matter now.

<blank>

"What the ......... what the hell, Anne ........! Ooohhhhh!"

<blank>

No good, I guess the cabaret girl is not going to be able to talk to me. Let's leave this guy alone.

<blank>

But what's going on? They gathered so many people and attacked us right after we left the store.

I wonder how it would feel to let these people go unchecked.

Well, in the end, I'll turn these attempted female assaulters over to the Guard!

<blank>

But the problem is that these things are all over the city! The danger is that they could spring up anywhere!

What if Karen or the twins are attacked again? That's what I mean!

<blank>

I think the quick and right answer is to disinfect this neighborhood, the filth, and clear the land clean!

Well, we will not do that!

So please stop staring at Koch with your jittery eyes, Beatrice!

<blank>

So let's think about this for a minute.

At least keep your eyes on Karen.

Let's take action here so that the hate will come to me.

<blank>

So I stood by the side of the crawling and jittery group and called out to them from above.

<blank>

Now, let's have a little chat, shall we?"

What the hell is this? Ko, kole ...... gaff!"

<blank>

It was so depressing to see it crawling around, zipping and scrambling, trying to get away, so I put my foot on its shoulder and held it down.

Ummm, this would be a dizzying way to try to look up! Keep it in a position where you can't peek! That's what a lady is supposed to do!

<blank>

I don't know what your intentions are in harassing this girl, but...

<blank>

The image that comes to mind is that of Carrie. The aura she exudes is overwhelming.

<blank>

She is my dear friend. I will not let anyone harm her.

<blank>

And Miss Cordelia's stout manner.

<blank>

If you still insist on committing lawlessness, then come to me at any time. Come back anytime.

<blank>

There I lightly fluffed the hair hanging on my shoulders with one hand, and cast a cold glance at the people writhing around my feet.

<blank>

Suzy Cloud here at AMCAM is always ready to help you, ......!

<blank>

What do you think? Did I earn enough hate for my villainous daughter?
