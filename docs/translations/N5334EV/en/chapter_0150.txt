# 138 The Siege of DeKembel

The first person I went to talk to after leaving the dormitory was Mrs. Colette Bair, the "Miss Bair" of the Bair Trading Company.

I wasn't sure if he was still in the office or not, but I went to the Nakasu receiving office to see if I could find him, but there were still lights on some of the windows, so I checked to see if there was any sign of him inside and then let him knock on the door.

At first, "Miss" was surprised by my sudden visit, but as we talked, she told me many details.

I'm thankful we've never met before.

<blank>

Is this also thanks to the good daily conduct of the company?

In this case, it's Irving's!

Let's treat them to something in the cafeteria after the vacation break, shall we? Mmm!

<blank>

<blank>

I was able to hear many stories from Miss.

Among other things, the historical story about the origins of De Kembel was very interesting, but now, well, that's OK.

<blank>

This time, I found out clearly that the company "Bear Logistics Shokai" was a big chivalrous organization that was in charge of the entire Maggalat First River Port, both inside and outside the company!

The fact that Irving and Mr. Davis were definitely the people in that line of work that Mr. Davis fought with on the first day!

What are they doing? Those guys!

I'm surprised to hear that "Miss" means exactly that.

<blank>

<blank>

From the point of view of these "older ladies," these people had been bothering them for a long time.

<blank>

They were supposed to be a group of semi-gangsters from outside of Japan, but they were doing whatever they wanted with funds from somewhere.

Extortion, robbery, human trafficking, and illegal drugs are commonplace.

Even if you destroy that end, they will gush in from somewhere, one after the other.

They do not have a specific location in mind when they try to destroy a base, but rather use multiple hideouts to destroy them as they go.

<blank>

Even when they thought they had located a large base, by the time they got in, the key funds and executives were already gone. It was a common occurrence.

Now they have a 'back door' and other things, and they have become a troublesome group that is so entrenched that they cannot be overlooked by DeKembel as a whole.

<blank>

Now Misses were working with several agencies, including our uncle, to set up a siege against them.

<blank>

And it seems that one of the executives, a man named Fluke, was the one who came to mess with Karen this time.

I don't know why the executives came all this way, but they saw this as a good opportunity.

Fluke is also the organization's safecracker, so they decided to just let him swim along and suppress all of his bases. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm...you're treating our Karen as a decoy. I see. ............

<blank>

Oh no, I'm just a little irritated.

I cracked the window glass with pressure! and you cracked it. ......

Calm down and be cool. Let's be cool.

<blank>

Missy shut up, too. Hmmm...I screwed up.

<blank>

I've got enough information, so I'm going to leave now.

I apologized to Miss Hagiai, who had fallen silent, for the rudeness of my sudden evening visit, and told her I would be leaving.

I used "Invisible Move" to remove any sign of them and quickly excused myself from the office.

<blank>

Was that a little out of courtesy?

I'll ask Irving to mend things nicely later. Yeah! I'll do that.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, now, at any rate, thanks to Miss.

That's a huge improvement from the clueless state I was in when I left the dorm!

<blank>

Well, I don't know where they are.

But okashi, however! There is still a guess to find!

<blank>

I was struck by the fact that they are a group of semi-legal people from outside of the country.

While I was listening to Miss Harrison's story, I searched a wide area for signs of the house and found it beautifully at the edge of the downtown area.

<blank>

Jules Nard. .......

You were with the stagecoach robbers at the time, weren't you?

If you're connected to these guys, you must know something about them.

<blank>

I followed the signs and found them scurrying around. What is he doing?

Oh well, I don't want to spend too much time on it, so let's go see Tot.

<blank>

When I got close to him after unpacking "Invisible Moves," he was crouching in the corner of some alley with a blue face.

What's the matter? Did you get a bad drink or something?

You've got to stop it. Don't kerfuffle in front of me or anything, okay?

<blank>

When I said, "I have a question," he replied, "Ask me anything! I replied, "Ask me anything you want!

That's a lot of momentum. ...... I'm a little taken back.

Well, I don't care if you tell me.

<blank>

<blank>

But it was more than I expected.

More than expected, Jules Nard's information exceeded what Miss Nard had.

I don't know if Miss Kayo was willing to disclose everything, but at least at the time of our conversation, there were three potential hideout sites. At least at the time of our earlier conversation, there were three possible hideouts, and it was impossible to determine where they were now.

<blank>

But this Jules Nard offered five locations for his hideout. And with a map!

He even stated that he would be here at this time of the day.

<blank>

What the hell, Jules Nard! Are you a useful guy by any chance?

I had vaguely thought that I might be able to expect more raw information from this guy, who seems to live in a more inner region, than from the older ladies who are gathering information from the outside. I had vaguely thought that I might be able to expect more raw information from this guy, who seems to live in a more inner region, than the misses who gather information from the outside!

Feeling a little better, I decided to play up the reward.

<blank>

With your fingertips, flip a slightly larger coin! with your fingertips.

Jules Nard, who grabbed it in mid-air, checked his hand and his eyes widened.

<blank>

"A medium gold coin? Isn't it 5A!

"Unh, information fee. Was it not enough?"

<blank>

I don't know the market price for this kind of information, you know?

I'll ask AnnaMarie about it one of these days.

I knew it was the big gold coin this time.

<blank>

No, no! That's not true!"

<blank>

I asked him and he said that's not true. Does it sound okay?

<blank>

If he's in there, I'll give you a nice bonus, okay?"

Huh?

"Oh, you can stay anywhere you want. I'll find you on my own."

Huzzah!"

<blank>

When I told him I would find him and raise him up, he made a funny sound and inhaled, and his face turned the color of paper. ......

You okay? Are you still drunk? Well, whatever.

<blank>

<blank>

Alright then, let's pay a visit to the target!

According to the map Jules Nard showed us, they are in the third-floor office of an unmarked brothel on the edge of a slum.

The story is that the other party is a genuine scum who sees the girl as nothing more than a tool.

There is absolutely no reason to treat someone who would have looked at our Karen that way gently.

...... Well, what can I do for you?

<blank>

For now, let's just see their faces before we decide!
