# Episode 138: The Siege of Dekember

The first place I went to gather information after leaving the dorm was the office of the "Boss," Mrs. Colette Bear of the Bear Trading Company.

I wasn't sure if she was still in the office, but I decided to take a chance and went to the loading office in Nakasu. There were still lights on in a few windows, so after confirming the presence inside, I knocked on the door.

<b>

The "Boss" was initially surprised by my sudden visit, but as we talked, she shared various detailed information with me.

It's quite generous of her, considering it was our first meeting.

<b>

I guess this is thanks to my good behavior on a daily basis?

In this case, it's more about Irvin's, though!

After the break, I should treat him to something nice at the cafeteria! Hmm!

<b>

<b>

I was able to hear various stories from the Boss.

Among them, the historical account of the origins of Dekember was particularly fascinating, but for now, let's set that aside.

<b>

What became clear this time was that the company "Bear Logistics Trading Company" was essentially a large organization that controlled both the underbelly and the surface of the entire first river port of Maguarat!

The fact that Irvin and Davis picked a fight with people from that organization on the first day is undeniable!!

What were they thinking? Those guys!

Honestly, the term "Boss" literally means that, right? It's surprising, isn't it?

<b>

<b>

According to the Boss, those troublesome individuals had been a nuisance for quite some time.

<b>

The group, which was supposed to be a half-criminal organization from abroad, had been doing whatever they pleased with some funding from somewhere.

Extortion, robbery, human trafficking, illegal drugsâ€”those were just the basics.

Even if we took out the lower ranks, they kept popping up one after another from somewhere.

Even if we tried to take down their base, they would use multiple hideouts without designating a specific location.

<b>

Even when they thought they had pinpointed a large base, it was common for the crucial funds and executives to be gone by the time they stormed in. That happened quite often.

Now, with the existence of "backdoors," they had become a troublesome group that had taken root to an extent that could not be overlooked from the perspective of the entire Dekember.

<b>

Currently, the Boss and her associates were collaborating with several agencies, including my uncle, to establish a siege against them.

<b>

And it seems that the one who had been bothering Karen this time was a man named Fluke, who was one of the executives.

I don't know why an executive would go out of his way to come, but the Boss saw this as a good opportunity.

Since Fluke was also the organization's treasurer, they planned to let him swim for a while and then take control of all his bases...

<b>

<b>

Hmmm, so they are treating our Karen as bait. Is that so...

<b>

Oh no, I got a bit irritated.

I ended up cracking the window with a sharp pressure!

Calm down, calm down. Let's keep it cool.

<b>

The Boss went silent too. Hmm, I messed up.

Well, it can't be helped. I've gathered enough information, so it's time to retreat.

I apologized to the now-silent Boss for my rudeness in visiting at night and took my leave.

I then used "Invisible Move" to erase my presence and quietly exited the office.

<b>

Did I step out of line a bit?

I'll have Irvin smooth things over later. Yes! That's what I'll do.

<b>

<b>

Well then, thanks to the Boss, I've confirmed the target.

What a huge leap from the state of having no leads when I left the dorm!

<b>

Well, I don't know where they are, though.

But still, it's strange! I still have a lead to search for!!

<b>

Since they are a half-criminal organization from abroad, it clicked for me.

While I was listening to the Boss's story, I tried to sense presences over a wide area and managed to find them splendidly at the edge of the entertainment district.

<b>

Jules Narl...

You were the one who was with the carriage robbers back then, weren't you?

If you have a connection with those guys, you might know something!

<b>

As I followed the presence, I found him wandering around here and there. What is he doing?

Well, whatever. I don't want to waste too much time, so let's go meet him quickly.

<b>

When I released "Invisible Move" and got closer, I found him crouched in a corner of an alley with a pale face.

What's wrong? Did you get sick from drinking?

Please don't throw up in front of me, okay?

<b>

When I said, "I have something I want to ask," he eagerly replied, "Ask me anything!"

He's quite enthusiastic... it's a bit off-putting.

Well, if he's willing to tell me, I don't mind.

<b>

<b>

However, it was more than I expected.

The information from Jules Narl exceeded what the Boss had.

Most importantly, I don't know if the Boss was willing to disclose everything, but at least at the point of our earlier conversation, there were three potential hideouts. He said he couldn't confirm where they were now.

<b>

However, Jules Narl provided five locations for the hideouts. And with a map!

Furthermore, he explicitly stated, "At this time, they are here."

<b>

What the heck, Jules Narl! Are you actually a useful guy?!

I had vaguely thought that he, who seemed to be living in a more inner area than the Boss and her associates who were gathering information from the outside, might provide more raw information, but he exceeded my expectations!

Feeling a bit good, I decided to give him a generous reward.

<b>

I flicked a slightly larger coin with my fingertip.

Jules Narl caught it in mid-air and opened his eyes wide as he checked what was in his hand.

<b>

"Is this... a gold coin?! Isn't it 5A?!"

"Yeah, it's for the information. Was it not enough?"

<b>

I don't really know the market rate for information like this...

I should ask Annemarie about it later.

I wonder if a large gold coin would have been better this time?

<b>

"N-no! That's not the case at all!!"

<b>

When I asked, he said it was fine. He seems to be okay?

<b>

"If I find him, I'll give you a success reward, okay?"

"Huh?"

"Oh, you can be anywhere. I'll find him on my own."

"Whoa!"

<b>

When I said I would find him myself, he inhaled sharply with a strange sound, and his face turned a paper-like color...

Is he okay? Is he still drunk? Well, whatever.

<b>

<b>

Well then, shall we go pay a visit to the target?

According to the map that Jules Narl provided, he seems to be in the third-floor office of a brothel that doesn't have a sign, right on the edge of the slums.

The story goes that the guy sees girls as nothing but tools, a genuine scumbag.

I have no reason to treat someone who would have looked at our Karen that way with any kindness.

...Now, what shall I do with him?

<b>

For now, I think I'll decide after seeing his face!
