# Episode 166: Mr. Roderick's Resolve

When merchants transport goods over long distances, a certain amount of loss is inevitably incurred.

There are items that get damaged or broken due to environmental conditions during transport, temperature changes, or poor roads. Items that lose freshness over time.

External factors like bad weather can cause wagons to be washed away or rendered useless.

In unmaintained areas, there is even the possibility of being attacked by magical beasts.

Not to mention, there are incidents of being attacked by people… by thieves, which is naturally expected.

<b>

Because of such circumstances, a certain amount of loss in transportation is originally calculated as part of the plan.

<b>

However, in the past six months, the loss rate due to theft affecting the Northmilia Trading Company on the Eastern Canal Highway has reached a scale that cannot be overlooked, including human casualties.

<b>

It seemed that the members of the trading company felt that the band of thieves was specifically targeting the Northmilia Trading Company.

<b>

Thus, when they requested the local government to strengthen the security on the highway, the Nasanturka County took the situation seriously and immediately agreed to enhance security, stating, "This is not just a problem for one trading company."

Nasanturka set up a post along the highway and began patrols by county knights.

<b>

However, in the Karnaflemer County, it was said that they were already taking sufficient measures, and little improvement had been made.

Particularly, the damage around Hexagom was severe, and even when they requested an increase in security around the town, they were told that it was currently being addressed, and nothing was being done.

<b>

Indeed, the attitude of the guards when entering this town was terrible.

Knowing the guards from Amukam and Dekembel, the severity of it stood out even more.

Those are not people who protect the town's security. They are just thugs, right?

<b>

I felt it again when I entered the town. The gaze of a man who seemed to be licking me with his eyes!

When I saw a guy who had his eyes glued to Mia's goods with an incredibly vulgar face, I couldn't help but feel like I wanted to stomp on him.

Well, I was dissuaded by Bibi, so I held back!

If that's the attitude of the guards, it shows just how low the standards of this town are.

<b>

In any case, it was clear from the moment I arrived that the security of this town was inadequate.

<b>

<b>

Oh, by the way, right now I'm wearing a long wig that reaches my back.

The color is slightly brighter and more amber than Bibi's vibrant hair. It's almost the same as Mr. Roderick's hair color.

My bangs are long enough to cover my eyes.

Additionally, I had Mia draw freckles on me.

My outfit consists of a clean white blouse and a lime green long skirt.

It's not too flashy or too plain; I think it gives off a modest, refined young lady vibe?!

It's truly a perfect disguise!

<b>

This outfit was prepared under Bibi's instructions before entering the town.

<b>

"With this, people might think you're Mr. Roderick's daughter... If someone is suspicious, they might see you as a young mistress!"

"Ah, uh... mistress?!"

"Well, it seems that the rumors of 'Lady Crimson' haven't reached the folks around here yet... but you never know where information might spread from."

"Huh? Lady Crim...?"

"That's not something for you to worry about!"

<b>

I didn't quite understand what Ruldri was saying, but this was meant to help disperse the danger that Mr. Roderick faced.

<b>

"Those who think they have sharp eyes will read too much into things and act on their own! They can't even imagine that what they've bitten into is a deadly poison!"

<b>

Bibi said this with a sly smile, reminiscent of Silence's dark grin.

<b>

<b>

In fact, Mr. Roderick approached this business trip with considerable resolve.

<b>

Not long ago, there was information provided from a reliable source regarding the band of thieves rampaging around Hexagom.

It was said that the thieves' target was not just the goods of the Northmilia Trading Company but also the company president, Mr. Roderick McGavin himself.

<b>

Mr. Roderick, undaunted by this news, declared that he would step forward himself.

Naturally, those around him, including Kuu Emel, strongly opposed this.

Well, that's to be expected.

However, Mr. Roderick insisted on hiring me as a bouncer to accompany him.

<b>

"Princess Suzy's side is safer than anywhere else!"

<b>

Mr. Roderick said this with a cheerful smile, recounting his conversation with Kuu Emel at that time.

<b>

The quality of the adversaries targeting them was well-known. If there's a possibility of being targeted anywhere, it would be safer to strike back with maximum force.

If they continued to hide in the back, they would only increase the casualties among their employees unnecessarily.

So, what would it mean if he didn't step forward?!

<b>

That's how he spoke to Kuu Emel, it seems.

<b>

I now understand that Kuu Emel welcoming us at the Adventurers' Guild was for this reason.

I thought he looked quite relieved. It seemed like he was saying, "Finally, you've come!" "We were really, really waiting for you!" with his whole being!

<b>

Well, I guess I'm quite the coward too? I think it's safer to crush the nest if I know where the threat is coming from rather than constantly being on guard against an unknown enemy. I can fully understand Mr. Roderick's way of thinking.

<b>

Mr. Roderick said, "Now is the time to make them realize who they're dealing with!" with a broad smile.

However, despite his cheerful words, his eyes were not smiling.

Within them swirled a fury against the thieves, and it was clear he was determined to avenge his subordinates' grievances, even if it meant using himself as bait to crush them.

<b>

Surely, Kuu Emel must have accepted Mr. Roderick's resolve and sent him off this time.

<b>

Of course, we have no intention of exposing Mr. Roderick to danger.

<b>

<b>

Bibi said, "Now that they don't understand our strength, it's a great opportunity."

Indeed, those who underestimate us tend to leave openings. It makes it easier to deal with them.

There's also another order from Anna Mary that I've been asked to fulfill.

In any case, the destination is the same.

<b>

Now, it’s just a matter of how skillfully we can bait them.

Well, as long as I stay quiet, that should be enough, so it's not a particularly difficult task!

<b>

...Huh? Why are Bibi and Mia looking at me with suspicious eyes?

Isn't that a bit rude? Just a bit?!
