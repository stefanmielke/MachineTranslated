# 166 Mr. Roderick's Decision

If merchants transport goods long distances, there will inevitably be a certain number of losses there.

Items that are defective or damaged due to environmental or temperature changes or rough roads during transportation. Items that lose freshness over time.

External factors such as bad weather can cause the wagons to be washed away or ruined by water.

If the land is not well maintained, it can even be attacked by demonic beasts.

It is no surprise that people are attacked by not only magical beasts, but also by ...... bandits.

<blank>

That being said, a certain number of losses in transportation were originally part of the calculation.

<blank>

But over the past six months or so, the loss rate due to banditry on the East Canal Road by the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce, including human casualties, has reached a scale that cannot be overlooked.

<blank>

It seemed to the merchants that the bandits were even pinpointing the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce.

<blank>

When we asked the local government to strengthen the security of the roads, Nasantorcha District took the situation seriously and immediately agreed to strengthen the security, saying, "It is not a problem of one trading company alone.

Nasantoluka has set up a station in the middle of the road to patrol the county knights.

<blank>

In Carnafraemer County, however, it is said that enough has already been done and little improvement has been made.

The damage around Hexagom was particularly severe, and when we asked for increased security around the town, we were told that it was currently being addressed, which was completely unacceptable.

<blank>

Indeed, the attitude of the guards was terrible when we entered this city.

Knowing the guards at Amkam and Dekembel, the awfulness of the situation is very apparent.

That's not someone who protects the security of the city, is it? He's just a thug, right?

<blank>

It's been a long time since I've felt that licking male gaze on my way into town. I felt a man's eyes licking my face!

When I saw the guy with his eyes glued to Mia's product and a ridiculously vile look on his face, I cringed and thought about stomping him.

Well, Bibi gave me the benefit of the doubt and dissuaded me from doing so!

If that is the attitude of a guard, it shows the extent of this city.

<blank>

Anyway, I knew from the first day I arrived that this city was not safe.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, by the way, I am now wearing a long wig that reaches my back.

The color is a little lighter and more amber than Bibi's tobi-colored hair. It is almost the same color as Roderick's hair.

Her bangs are also long enough to cover her eyes.

In addition, I even had Mia write freckles on it.

The attire was a clean white blouse and a long lime green skirt.

It's not too flashy, not too plain, and it gives off a mature, ladylike vibe, don't you think?

It is indeed a perfect disguise!

<blank>

This is the outfit that Bibi had me wear before I entered the city.

<blank>

I'm sure this will make Mr. Roderick's daughter or ...... look like a young mistress!"

Oh, ai......, jin?

Well, I guess the rumor of 'Lady Crimson' hasn't reached the folks around here yet ......, but you never know where it might come from."

"What about? Reedikurimu ......?"

It's not your concern!"

<blank>

I didn't understand what Mr. Rudry was talking about, but this is something that serves to disperse the danger to Roderick.

<blank>

The people who think they're so clever are the ones who read too much into things and make their own moves, without even being able to imagine that what they're feeding on is a miracle drug! They can't even imagine that what they're biting into is a miracle drug!

<blank>

Bibi "grinned" and with a black smile cherished by Mr. Silence, spat out such words.

<blank>

<blank>

In fact, Mr. Roderick took on this business trip with a great deal of determination.

<blank>

Some time ago, I was informed by a reliable source regarding a group of bandits who were rampaging around Hexagom.

It is not only the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce's shipments that the thieves are after, but its chairman of commerce, Mr. Roderick McGovern himself. The story goes.

<blank>

Mr. Roderick was not intimidated by the story and said that he would then come forward directly.

Naturally, those around him, such as ...... Cu Emel, were very much against it.

Well, of course.

However, I heard that Mr. Roderick pushed through with the idea of hiring me as a bouncer and having me accompany him.

<blank>

She convinced me that Princess Susie's side is safer than anywhere else!"

<blank>

So Roderick, with a big smile on his happy face, told me about the conversation he had with Cu Emel at that time.

<blank>

The quality of the people who target us is well known. If there is a possibility that you will be targeted wherever you are, it is safer for you to go out there with your maximum strength.

If they continue to hide behind it, it will only cause more harm to their employees unnecessarily.

Then what would I do if I didn't step forward?

<blank>

And that is how he told Cu Emel.

<blank>

I now understood that that was what Cu Emel had meant when he greeted me at the Adventurers' Guild.

I thought he looked very relieved. "You're here at last! We've been waiting for you for a long time! I could feel her whole body was saying, "I've been waiting for you for a long time!

<blank>

Well, I'm also pretty scared, you know? I think it is safer and safer to destroy the nest as soon as you know where it is, than to be constantly on the lookout for someone you don't know where they are coming from. I can fully understand your thinking, Roderick.

<blank>

Mr. Roderick says, "Now is the time to make them pay for what they've done!" he says magnanimously.

However, while he speaks with a broad smile, his eyes are not smiling.

He is a man who is determined to avenge his men and crush them, even if he has to use himself as bait.

<blank>

I am sure that Ms. Cu Emmer also accepted Roderick's determination and sent him out this time.

<blank>

Of course, we have no intention of putting Mr. Roderick in danger.

<blank>

<blank>

Bibi says, "This is a great opportunity now that they don't understand our capabilities.

It's true that those who lick you have a lot of skittishness. It is easy to deal with them.

There is also another order that AnnaMarie has asked me to fill.

Either way, the destination is the same.

<blank>

The only thing left is how skillfully you can get them to bite.

Well, since all I have to do is be quiet, it's not that difficult!

<blank>

......? Why do Bibi and Mia look at me with such a suspicious look?

Isn't that a little rude? I don't know!
