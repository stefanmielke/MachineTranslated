# Episode 84: The Academy on the Hill

"Everyone! An urgent message pigeon has arrived!"

"What? Did something happen to the young lady?!"

"Please wait a moment! I'm connecting now...!!"

"What happened, Millie?! What is going on?!!"

"Calm down, Kenneth. It seems that the carriage carrying the young ladies was attacked by a band of thieves."

"What?!"

"And then?! What happened? What occurred?!!"

"Randolph and Rufino, please calm down! There's no need to panic; we already know the outcome! Of course, it was an instant kill!!"

"「「「Whoa!!!」」」"

"Indeed! As expected! As expected of the young lady! So?! What are the details?! More specifics!!"

"That's why I need you to stay calm, Kenneth! Um... it seems that the leader of the band of thieves who tried to harm the passengers was crushed in an instant, with just a single fingertip, leaving him near death!"

"「「「Ohhh!」」」"

"The other thieves took that as a signal and dealt with the rest, but it seems they arrived in Dekkenbel much later than planned due to the aftermath. They will send a detailed report once they settle down at the school."

<b>

"Indeed! I see! I see! No, as expected! They really did it right from the start!"

"You seem quite pleased, Kenneth. But! This is not the time to celebrate the young lady's achievements here! We have to turn this into an article!!"

"Of course! From this season onward, we have been entrusted with the fan club newsletter!"

"You seem quite motivated, Randolph!"

"What are you saying?! Aren't you the same, Rufino?!"

"Needless to say?! The highlight this time is the young lady's enrollment!!"

<b>

"That's right! This time, the top feature is the young lady's uniform! It's a uniform appearance! A uniform!! The young lady in that uniform!! She will definitely be adorable, without a doubt?!! Kuuuuuuuu!!!"

"Calm down, Millie. What are you going to do if you get all worked up? You're the editor-in-chief, you know?"

"Ah! I apologize, Randolph. I almost got swept away by my imagination and delusions."

"Get a grip, will you?! Editor-in-chief! So? Did you manage to see the young lady in her uniform when you went to see her off?"

"Ugh! Unfortunately, I couldn't make it in time for the send-off due to work! So... so! I couldn't catch a glimpse of the young lady's splendid appearance!!!"

"I-I understand! I can tell you're quite frustrated, so stop shedding blood tears!! It's painful for us to watch!"

"Kuuuu! I apologize for showing you such an unsightly side of myself... I'm sorry."

"Well, you don't have to worry about it; it's not like being sick is a new thing... More importantly! What about the young lady's photo?"

"Just now, I feel like you mentioned something concerning... But don't worry, Randolph! This time, the photos are being taken by Caron, and they are currently being developed. They should arrive here by tonight."

"I see, Caron! If it's him, I can trust him! But... so, among us newsletter staff, it seems Caron is the only one who got to see the young lady in her uniform..."

"That's right, Rufino. It's frustrating, but we can trust Caron... Kuu!"

"…So, don't let those blood tears overflow…"

"Kuh! However! Regardless of anything! From now on, the five of us will be in charge of the newsletter! And the local correspondent is Anna Mary! Everyone is a fellow student from the same Milia Castella Academy! Let's work together to convey the charm of the young lady!!!"

"「「「Ohhh!!」」」"

<b>

"You're already aware of what happened in Palus, aren't you?"

"Yeah, I received the message through the 'pigeon.' I've also sent someone from our side, so you don't need to worry about the aftermath."

"Thank you for your trouble."

"So don't worry about it, Suzy. Rather, I'm more concerned that the Amkam folks, upon receiving the news, might be getting too carried away. Haha! I can just picture it, can't you?"

<b>

In response to my uncle's words, I couldn't help but let out a slightly dry laugh.

Anna Mary had already boasted that she used the 'pigeon' to inform Amkam. When on earth did she do that?! And why was she so smug about it?!!

<b>

This 'pigeon' is one of the clay golems modeled after carrier pigeons.

Originally, carrier pigeons were used as a means of communication in this world as well, but unlike living pigeons, clay golems do not tire.

They can fly any distance without resting, and since they synchronize with the caster, it is clear whether the message was delivered or if there was an accident along the way.

With the advancements in clay magic technology, it is said that they are more convenient than carrier pigeons and are thus highly valued as a means of communication.

<b>

The 'pigeon' is used to connect the caster with another caster, or one location with another.

In the former case, the distance, speed, and amount of information vary greatly depending on the user's magical power.

In the latter case, it doesn't select users, but the speed and amount of information depend on the capacity of the built-in magical battery.

<b>

In any case, the 'pigeon' pursues cost performance (mainly speed), so it seems that it cannot fly well unless the mana flow is stable.

In places like Iloshio, where the magical flow is turbulent, it cannot be used properly.

Even so, if it can be used normally, it is said that it can reach a distance of about 100 kilometers in less than two hours, which is quite impressive.

<b>

<b>

"Interrogations of the culprits will likely begin today or tomorrow. They must learn the foolishness of messing with us (Amkam) through their bones."

<b>

Uncle Philip said this with a refreshing smile, despite the ominous words.

In response, Vivi and Anna Mary replied with equally calm smiles, saying, "Of course! No doubt about it!" while not even trying to hide their murderous intent.

Oh dear, why are these kids so ominous?

<b>

While Vivi and Anna Mary were exuding a threatening aura, the tea and sweets provided by Aunt Liliana and Annie filled the carriage with a sweet scent, unaffected by the tense atmosphere.

<b>

The cookies baked with dried fruits were delightful, with the concentrated fruit flavors crumbling and melting in my mouth, the soft cookie dough collapsing and cascading in. The sweetness and tartness of the dried fruits, combined with the fragrant aroma of wheat and milk, all came together!

Moreover, when I had a bite-sized chocolate cake, it felt like it melted in my mouth along with happiness, and I had to place my hand on my cheek to prevent my cheeks from falling off, shaking my face in delight.

<b>

Seeing me like that, Annie kept offering me more and more of Aunt's homemade sweets.

I'm completely melting away in happiness, you know?!

Vivi and Anna Mary's threatening atmosphere is nothing compared to this?!

<b>

As I indulged in Aunt's prideful sweets, the carriage carrying us slowly made its way through the streets of Dekkenbel.

<b>

<b>

Eventually, the carriage carrying us progressed to a slightly elevated area, higher than the city.

<b>

As we were about to reach the top of the slope leading from the city, a spear-like iron fence reminiscent of some palace began to appear on our right.

The fence stretched endlessly, with trees lining the inside, making it seem as if the fence surrounded most of the hilltop.

As we passed the fence on our right and continued a bit further on the now flat road, a large gate appeared to welcome us.

It was indeed majestic like a palace gate, with two magnificent stone gateposts connected by an arch that resembled a bird spreading its wings, adorned with finely detailed decorations of lilies and roses.

<b>

This is Milia Castella Academy. The place where we will be spending our time from now on.

Standing before this main gate, if I look back at the road we came from, I can see the townscape of Dekkenbel in its entirety.

It truly is a picturesque hilltop school.

<b>

"Under normal circumstances, I would have liked to let you rest at the mansion after the long journey. But we can't afford to be late for the enrollment procedures... Please forgive me."

"Not at all! Uncle! Please don't worry about it!"

"It will be tough for a while, so come to the house for the weekend once you settle down."

"Yes! Aunt! I will definitely come!"

"Suzie sister! You must come right away!"

"Yes, Annie! I'll go right away!"

<b>

This main gate is open only until 4 PM.

In less than an hour, it seems this gate will be closed.

If we had gone to Uncle's mansion, we wouldn't have made it before closing time, so unfortunately, we can't visit today.

If the carriage had arrived on time, we would have had time for tea together... 

Just thinking back on it makes me feel quite annoyed at those thugs! Shouldn't they have learned their lesson a bit more?

<b>

<b>

We unloaded our luggage from the carriage that brought us to the main gate, exchanged promises to meet Uncle Philip, Aunt Liliana, and Annie soon, and expressed our gratitude for their send-off.

From the window of the departing carriage, Annie leaned out and waved, while Colin and I waved back until the carriage disappeared from view.

<b>

<b>

Before us, a majestic gate stood open, welcoming us as we approached.

<b>

The last time I came here for the entrance exam was in the early spring of the second month of the Red Moon. That was four months ago.

It has been since that time that I passed through this gate, so it is certainly not my first time, but I am still overwhelmed by its splendor.

Colin was watching us with a smile, his eyes narrowing like a tangerine.

<b>

"First, let's get our admission permission, shall we? Then I'll guide you to the dormitory right away."

<b>

Since a while ago, several students wearing the same uniform as us had been entering through the gate.

Among those entering, some were being led by students wearing different colored uniforms, similar to Colin's.

I wonder if, like us, the new students are being guided by local seniors?

<b>

As I pondered this, I held my outfit bag in both hands and turned my gaze toward the town of Dekkenbel visible beyond the slope.

In the strong sunlight, a gentle breeze tickled my cheeks and stirred my hair.

As I gazed at the townscape spreading out beyond the slope, I felt a mix of excitement and slight anxiety about the new life that had finally begun.

And as I felt nostalgia for Amkam, which was now far away, emotions rose and intertwined within my chest, creating a complex turmoil.

But still, the breeze I felt here was very pleasant.

<b>

<b>

<b>

And then, while Colin and Anna Mary were processing our admission permission at the guardhouse inside the gate, it happened.

<b>

Was that wind some kind of updraft moving from the lowlands to the high ground?

The wind that came from the bottom of the slope blew upward toward the gate at the top of the hill.

<b>

We instinctively held onto our hats to prevent them from being blown away by the sudden wind, but the wind's mischief didn't stop there.

<b>

"Upyamyu?!!"

"Kyah!"

"Nn!!"

<b>

In a moment of distraction, a gust of wind swept up from below, completely flipping our skirts.

I quickly tried to hold them down, but the back was completely lifted, and I couldn't help but let out a strange voice!

Vivi and Mia seemed to have managed to avoid disaster, but why was it just me who was caught off guard?!

I turned around in shock to find Arvin and Lombard quickly averting their eyes!

<b>

Ugh!! Could it be that a lucky misfortune has activated in such a place?!!

<b>

On this special day, when a new school life is about to begin, I am wearing particularly special undergarments.

This is because of Sonia Mama's teaching: "The grooming that is invisible is what refines a woman," and "On special days, wear your best!" 

Thus, on such days, I always wear something special. This is not for others to see, but to tighten my mind and body!

And yet... and yet, to have it so easily exposed to the public...!

<b>

Even behind Arvin, there are people with their eyes wide open!

I hurriedly turned back around, pressing my skirt down to hide my rear, but I know it's too late for regrets!!!

I can feel my head heating up rapidly!!

<b>

"Wait a minute?! M-Me?! Why are you looking at me like I did something?!!"

<b>

Receiving the glares of the three girls, Arvin frantically thrust his hands forward, shaking his head in denial, shouting as if he didn't understand what was happening!

<b>

"R-Ron! You say something too!! I didn't do anything, right?!!"

"…Arvin. It's no use, give up."

<b>

Ron, who was looked at with pleading eyes by Arvin, averted his gaze and quietly shook his head.

<b>

"W-Why, why, why can't I accept this!!!"

<b>

Arvin's anguished scream echoed hollowly around us.

Lucky misfortunes should perish!!
