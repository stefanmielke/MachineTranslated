# 84 The School on the Hill

'Ladies and gentlemen! We've got an emergency delivery pigeon for you!"

What? Did something happen to your daughter?

'Wait a minute! I'm communicating now ............!!!"

'What's the matter, Millie? What's going on!!!!!!!"

Calm down, Kenneth. It seems that the carriage in which the ladies were riding was attacked by a group of bandits.

What?

And?" What happened? What happened?

Randolph and Ruffino, please calm down! There's no need to panic, you already know the outcome! Of course it will be instantaneous!

""Woah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Mm-hmm! That's a stone! You're the quintessential young lady! And? Details? Details!

'So don't panic, Kenneth! Let's see......... They say that in an instant, with a single fingertip, he shattered the face of the leader of a band of thieves who tried to injure a passenger, and nearly killed him!"

""Ho-oh!""

I heard that the other pirates took that as their cue to clean up the mess, and that they arrived in De Kembel much later than scheduled due to the subsequent processing. They will send us a report with all the details after they get settled in at the school.

<blank>

Mm-hmm! I see! I see! No, I don't! You're just as good as I thought you would be! You've done it right from the start!"

You look happy, Kenneth. But! But, this is not the time to be happy about your daughter's success! We have to write about it!

It's no wonder! From this season on, we've put ourselves in charge of the fan club bulletin!"

You're really getting into this, Randolph!

What are you talking about? Aren't you, Ruffino?

'I don't need to tell you, do I? Above all, the highlight of this time is the admission of your daughter!"

<blank>

'That's right! At the top of the list this time is your daughter's uniform! It's a uniform! The uniform! The young lady in that uniform! I bet she's absolutely adorable already, don't you! Koooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！"

You're not going to get all heated up, are you? What's the matter with you getting all heated up? You're the editor-in-chief, remember?"

I'm sorry, Randolph! I'm sorry, Randolph. I was just about to be swallowed up by a wave of imagination and fantasy."

'Pull yourself together, will you? Editor-in-Chief! And? You were all breathless to see me off, ......, but did you get to see your daughter in her uniform?"

Damn! Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to work to see you off! So ......, so! I was not able to be among the first to see your daughter's big day!

'Wow, I get it! I understand that you are very frustrated, so stop shedding tears of blood! You're making it hard for me to watch!"

I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry ...... for showing you the unfortunate part after the other."

'No, well, don't worry about it, I'm sick, it's nothing new. ...... More than that! And if that's the case, what's going to happen to your daughter's picture?"

'I think you just said something salacious that's been bothering me: ....... It's okay, Randolph! Kalon took the photos this time, and I'm having them developed now. They should arrive here this evening.

I see... Kalon! I'm sure he's a safe bet! But ......, I see that Kalon is the only one of us in charge of the newsletter who got to see the young lady in her uniform this time. ......

'That's right, Ruffino. It's a frustrating thing, but you can trust Karon. ...... Kuh!"

"...... so don't let the tears of blood overflow ............"

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it! But! Whatever the case may be! From this time on, the five of us are in charge of the newsletter! And our local correspondent is Anna Mary! We are all from the same boarding school, Milia Castel Eye! Let's work together to convey the charms of your daughter!

""Oh!""

You already knew what happened at Palouse, didn't you?"

I've been in touch with them on "Pigeons". We have people on their way, so you don't have to worry about what happens next."

Thank you for your time.

I'm more worried about the Amkam people getting too excited when they hear the news. I'm more worried about the Amkam people getting too excited when they hear the news, you know? Ha, ha! I can see it in your eyes, can't you?

<blank>

Your uncle's story makes me laugh a little dryly, yes, .......

He smugly told Amkam that AnnaMarie had already informed him using "pigeons". When in the world did this happen? And why the smug look?

<blank>

This "pigeon" is one of the clay golems built in the shape of a carrier pigeon.

Originally, the clay pigeon was used as a means of communication in this world as well, but unlike a live pigeon, the clay golem is tireless.

It can fly any long distance without resting, and since it is synchronized with the surgeon who flies it, it can tell if there was an accident on the way and it did not reach the destination, or if it did reach the destination without fail.

In these days of advanced clay magic technology, it is said to be a more convenient and useful means of communication than a dove.

<blank>

Pigeons" are used between a surgeon and a surgeon who uses them. Or it is used to connect place to place.

The former varies greatly in distance, speed, and amount of information depending on the magic value of the person using it.

The latter does not choose the user, but its speed and the amount of information it contains are said to be in line with the capacity of the built-in magic battery.

<blank>

In any case, "pigeons" are pursuing cost performance (mainly speed), so they cannot fly well unless the mana flow is stable, apparently.

I heard that it cannot be used properly in places like Irosio, where the magical currents are rough.

Still, if it can be used normally, it is a great performance since it is said to arrive in less than two hours for a distance of about 100 kilometers.

<blank>

<blank>

The questioning of the culprits will begin today and tomorrow," he said. The stupidity of messing with us (AMCAM) needs to be drilled into their bones.

<blank>

Uncle Philip smiled briskly and said a thing or two.

And Bibi and AnnaMarie, of course!　They have no objection.　They replied with gentle smiles, not trying to hide their not-so-gentle killing spirit.

I hate it. Why are these kids so noisy?

<blank>

Bibi and AnnaMarie were emitting a swarthy killing spirit, but the tea cakes served by Aunt Liliana and Annie were filling the carriage with a sweet aroma, oblivious to such a deadly presence.

<blank>

The dried fruit baked into the cookies are all wonderful, and the concentrated fruit flavors are crumbled and melted into an avalanche of crispy, moist, soft cookie dough that crumbles and melts into the mouth. The sweetness and sourness of dried fruit. The aroma of savory wheat and milk fall together there!

I was so happy that I couldn't help but shake my face with my hands on my cheeks to prevent my cheeks from falling off.

<blank>

Annie, looking at me like this, offers me her aunt's homemade sweets one after another, this one and that one.

I'm so happy that my body and mind are already melting, you know?

Where is the swashbuckling atmosphere of Bibi and AnnaMarie?

<blank>

So, while our aunt's specialty sweets soothed the fatigue of our long journey, the carriage carrying us slowly made its way through the streets of De Kembel.

<blank>

<blank>

Soon, the carriage carrying us was moving along a slightly elevated hill-like area, somewhat higher than the city.

<blank>

As we were about to climb the slope leading up from the city, an iron fence in the shape of a spear, reminiscent of some palace, began to appear on the right side of the road.

The fence stretches for miles and is lined with trees inside, making it seem as if the fence surrounds most of the top of this hill.

We climbed up the hill and walked along the flat road, looking at the fence on our right, until a large gate appeared to welcome us.

It is as majestic as a palace gate, with two magnificent stone pillars connected by an archway that resembles a bird spreading its wings, and finely and carefully decorated with lilies, roses, and other flowers and plants.

<blank>

This is the Milia Castel Eye boarding school. This is where we are going to spend the rest of our lives.

In front of this main gate, if you look back the way you came, you can see a panoramic view of the town of De Kembel.

It is truly a picturesque Yamanote school.

<blank>

If it were true, it would have been right after a long trip, and I wanted him to have a good rest at the mansion. I would have missed the procedures for entering the dormitory. ...... Forgive me."

Oh no! Uncle! Don't mind me, sir!"

I know it's going to be tough for a while, so come home this weekend when you're settled."

'Yes, sir! Aunt! I will come to you for sure!"

I'm sure you'll come soon, Sister Suzy! You must come soon!"

"Yeah, Annie, I'll be there in a minute! I'll be right there!"

<blank>

This main gate is only open until 4:00 in the afternoon.

It seems that in less than an hour, this gate will be closed.

If I had to go to my uncle's house, I would miss the closing gate, so unfortunately, I can no longer visit you today.

If the carriage had arrived on time, we would have had enough time for everyone to have tea. ......

Just thinking back on it, they were such a bunch of punks! Should I have let them sink their teeth into me a little more?

<blank>

<blank>

We unloaded our luggage from the carriage that had brought us to the front gate, promised Uncle Philip, Aunt Liliana, and Annie that we would see them soon, and thanked them for the ride.

Annie leaned out the window of the moving carriage and waved, and Colin and I waved back until the carriage was out of sight.

<blank>

<blank>

Beyond where our luggage was placed, a majestic gate stood open, as if welcoming us.

<blank>

The last time I came here for an entrance exam was in early spring, four months ago.

It was not the first time for me to go through this gate, but I was still overwhelmed by the splendor of the place.

Colin looked at us with a smile and squinted his tangerine eyes.

<blank>

Let's just get permission to enter the school and then we'll take you to your dormitory. Then I'll show you to your dormitory right away.

<blank>

From a few minutes ago, a number of children wearing the same uniforms as ours were entering the gate.

Several of the groups of children entering are led by students in uniforms of different colors, similar to Colin's.

I wonder if the local seniors are guiding the new students like we are.

<blank>

With these thoughts in mind, I kept my eyes on the town of Dekenber, which I could see beyond the hill, with my own costume bag in both hands, beside the children who were walking into the gate.

A soft breeze blowing in the strong sunlight tickled my cheeks and shook my hair.

Looking at the cityscape spread out across the hill in front of me, I felt a little excited and a little anxious about my new life, as if I had finally arrived.

And the nostalgia for Amcam, which is so far away and rears its ugly head so quickly, surfaces and intertwines again and again in the back of my chest, making my feelings complicated.

But still, the breeze I receive here and now is very pleasant.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And it happened while Colin and AnnaMarie were processing our admission to the school in the guardroom inside the gate.

<blank>

Was the wind like an updraft, moving from lower to higher ground?

The wind came from down the hill and blew up toward the gate at the top of the hill.

<blank>

We held our hats down with our hands to keep them from being blown off by the sudden wind, but that was not the end of the wind's rampage.

<blank>

"Aaahhhhhhhhh!!!!!!"

Kya!"

Mmm!

<blank>

Our skirts were tossed about by the gusts of wind that came up from under our feet, as if taking advantage of a momentary lapse.

I quickly restrained myself, but the back was completely rolled up and I couldn't help but make a funny noise!

<blank>

Bibi and Mia barely survived, but why only me?

I turned around and saw Irving and Lombardo looking away from me! Irving and Lombardo turn their heads to the side with a ba-ba-ba-ba!

<blank>

Damn! Don't tell me that a lucky break was triggered at a place like this?

<blank>

On this special day, the beginning of a new school life, the undergarments worn today are moderately spirited.

That's because I've learned from Sonia Mama's teachings: "It's the grooming that you can't see that makes a woman shine," and "On special occasions, wear something that will win! This is because they are imbued with the teachings of their mother, Sonia Mama.

Therefore, on days like this, I always wear something special. This is not for show, but to tighten up my body and mind!

That's ......, and that's how easily it is exposed to the public, or ......!

<blank>

Even behind Irving, there are people peeling their eyeballs out!

I turned my back in a hurry and held my skirt to cover my buttocks, but I knew it would all be over later, right?

I can also feel the intense heat rapidly rising up from my neck!

<blank>

Wait a minute! Hey, wait a minute! Why are you looking at me like I did something?

<blank>

Irving was flustered by the stares from the three of us girls, and he thrust his hands out in front of him, shaking his head as if he didn't understand what we were talking about!

<blank>

'Lo, Ron! You say something, too! I didn't do anything, did I?

"...... Irving. You can't do it, give up."

<blank>

When Irving gave him a clinging look, Ron averted his gaze and shook his head quietly.

<blank>

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na. ！！！！

<blank>

Irving's plaintive cries echoed hollowly around the area.

Aku (Lucky Scarecrow) must perish!
