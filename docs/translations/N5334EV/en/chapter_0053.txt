# 48 The Morning of Susie Cloud, age 14

Before the sun had yet peeked over the horizon.

The morning air is still cold and stings the skin.

<blank>

The sky tinged with white at the break of dawn was cloudless, and the luggage was loaded onto the wagon with white breath.

<blank>

The carriage did not belong to the house, but was sent by the village.

<blank>

The man who is helping me lift my luggage from the gyoja seat is Kalon Cournot, who came to pick me up from the village.

He is 19 years old and just moved up to 2nd this year.

<blank>

Kalon, take good care of him."

Yes, sir! Leave it to me!"

<blank>

Mr. Karon, who was approached just as he finished unloading, stood erect in his seat and answered Papa Howard in a hushed voice.

<blank>

Those who undergo the "ordeal" must leave home alone before dawn on the day of their birthday.

<blank>

In this way, they can be picked up from the village, but their families can only see them off at home and not follow them.

<blank>

After we finished loading our luggage, Sonia-mama and Elrose called out to us.

<blank>

Have a good day, and be careful, Susie..."

"Welcome aboard, miss."

"Hi. I'm going to go! I'm off."

<blank>

I responded to both of them cheerfully and well.

<blank>

Don't overdo it. Okay?"

I'm fine! Don't worry, take it easy, we'll do it."

<blank>

He also smiled at Papa Howard.

<blank>

Before we walked out of the house, we received birthday congratulations from both Howard Papa and Sonia Mama, as well as Elrose.

The warmth that still lingers on my arms and cheeks is felt even more keenly in the cold outside air.

<blank>

The adults in my family tend to be more overprotective than necessary.

The cause was that I started crying at dinner the day before yesterday...oh, a black history that is embarrassing to recall was born here as well!

Whenever you get lonely, ask around for help, Papa Howard says.

I'm still thinking I'm going to cry again?

<blank>

I'm going to do it! I'll make it right!

<blank>

He smiled and showed his hands clasped tightly together, though he was slightly twitching inside his chest.

<blank>

With the help of Mr. Caron, we climbed straight into the carriage.

We'll leave now," Mr. Karon announced, and the carriage began to move.

<blank>

The eastern sky was beginning to take on a reddish tinge.

The sun is about to rise soon.

Those who undergo the "ordeal" must leave home before the sun comes up.

<blank>

I waved from the top of the moving carriage and said goodbye as I was seen off by Papa Howard, Mama Sonia, and Ms. Elrose.

The three of them stood there and looked me over.

Down the hillside, zipping along until you can't see it....

Oh, no, I'm about to cry!

<blank>

"You are loved by everyone, young lady..."

<blank>

Mr. Karon said something like that in a pithy tone.

<blank>

Howard's dad, Sonia's mom, and Elrose are all very, very kind...so..."

<blank>

After Mr. Caron smiled back at me, I stared straight ahead and steered the carriage.

<blank>

Mr. Caron is a good man...he seems to have taken care of me.

It was like they decided not to look at my teary eyes.

I buried my face in my cloak and sniffed a little.

<blank>

<blank>

As the carriage moves forward, the sun begins to rise and the sky is tinged with a morning glow.

The sky and the earth, the world is dyed in the color of dawn.

It's a world of just one morning.

In such a world, Mr. Caron also rushed the carriage in silence.

The goal is to get to the Tsumesho of One.

<blank>

<blank>

We arrived at Tsumesho when the sun was fully up and the sky had calmed down.

<blank>

The group members were already waiting in front of the Tsumesho.

<blank>

Congratulations." Miss. I look forward to working with you for the next week!"

Thank you, Millie! It's nice to meet you too! I'm looking forward to working with you!"

<blank>

The first person to congratulate me on my birthday after getting out of the carriage was Millie from Cecily's store.

<blank>

Millie is one of the four members of the group that I will be working with for a week.

<blank>

The "Rite of Coming of Age" ordeal.

A week of survival in the forest of Amkamu. In other words, encampment.

<blank>

During the week-long encampment, members of the group will be watching and escorting us from afar.

<blank>

Moreover, the escort will be provided by the most competent people from the middle to the top ranks.

The luxury of having one child and several upper to middle group members! We are taking a lot of trouble!

<blank>

Millie Barrett is a scout and wears dark leather armor.

Her slender body and white thighs peeking out from her hot pants are dazzling!

<blank>

<blank>

'Congratulations on your day, young lady Cloud. Nice to meet you starting today."

Thank you very much." Nice to meet you, Ilta!"

<blank>

Ms. Ilta Lindeman is a recovering member of the upper group rank 8th.

At 22 years old, he is a teaching priest.

In other words, he is an outstanding person of the same class as the chief priest.

A bustle skirt and corset peeked out from the cloak as we shook hands.

I hear that Mr. Irta is also in fashion nowadays.

I was thrilled to see her white legs peeking out from her bustle skirt.

The volume of her bosom, which could be seen even through her cloak, made me think that she was in charge of sex appeal despite being a clergyman! Oh, I'm sorry!

<blank>

<blank>

I'm so happy for you, Miss Susie. I will be your companion for a week starting today."

Thank you Mr. Ketty, I will be with you for a week!"

<blank>

Ms. Ketty Forrest is a warlock who has mastered the art of summoning magic.

The group rank is also the middle rank of the 7th at 21 years of age.

The summoning magic of warlocks is extremely versatile, serving as attack, defense, and support, and while they can play two or three roles at once, it is said that it is difficult to master.

However, Mr. Ketty is still very good at using it, and Papa Howard said that it would not be long before he would move up to the upper group ranks.

<blank>

<blank>

Happy Birthday Suzy! I'll be guarding you for the next week!"

I'm so glad you're here, Aria! Nice to meet you from today, right!"

<blank>

After exchanging greetings with three of them, a fourth, Alia, hugged me and congratulated me.

<blank>

<blank>

Alia Browk is the eldest daughter of the Browk family.

Yes, she is Lombard's sister who is the same age as me.

<blank>

They are familiar with each other because they often see each other in the school's training halls, where their relatives are often in charge of teaching.

<blank>

<blank>

Aria is only 24 years old and is the 10th and Battlemaster of the highest rank of the group.

The fighting style of the Burok family, one of the 12 Amcam groups.

It is the cornerstone of the vanguard of a combined offensive and defensive defense that uses the battle axe to smash the enemy and then uses it for defense as well.

Although both Lombardo and Aria share this style, Aria's battle prowess as a battle master is unmatched by Lombardo's.

It is even said that an individual can already hold off an entire battalion.

We will be giving them an 'A' in the near future. And this was also said by Papa Howard.

<blank>

A" is a kind of title given to those who have risen to the 10th level and have been recognized as having a certain level of power.

It is called "grade," and there are "A," "AA," and the highest "AAA.

When you have a grade, your name is known inside and outside the company, and you may have two names.

Like Mr. Ryder's "The Golden Vampire Slayer"! By the way, Mr. Ryder is an "AA".

Once your name becomes well known, you will be asked to protect important people and exterminate demonic beasts in the royal capital and regional cities.

<blank>

In fact, it seems that this is Amcam's largest source of income.

After all, it is a force that can put a battalion in a one-man battle.

I heard that the fee for "A" is at least as much as the annual income of ten regular knights! That's outrageous!

<blank>

In addition, Howard Papa has retired from the front line and is now down to an 'A'....

I feel like I'm falling down and getting an 'A' or maybe even a Howard Papa....

I hope that I will never be given a second name, even if by mistake I become a "grader" or something! I secretly vowed to myself!

<blank>

I think it's crazy to think that one person can overwhelm a group of knights by himself, right? It's too much to be a fighting race, isn't it? I don't know why the country allows such a force to exist!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And speaking of Aria, she was sliding her cheeks together in an embrace....

Now you can come to my house anytime you want! Yes, yes, yes!

<blank>

I was not sure what to expect!

<blank>

I'm not going! I'm not going! I don't have a wife! I don't have a wife! I don't have a wife or anything! No!

No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, not Ron! You know that, right? "Mmm-hmm."

Nyo! Well, again, sonna! Nyaa!"

<blank>

Saying this, Aria tightened her hold on me and squeezed me even tighter!

<blank>

Aria's body is large, as is typical of the Lombard family.

He is nearly 6 feet tall and has powerful muscles like an athlete, but not martial ones.

They are toned yet protected by a moderate amount of fat and are intensely well rounded!

Underneath his cloak, he is a dynamite buddy who wraps his rocket tits in a hideous bikini-armor made from the leather of a magical beast!

Aria shakes her Lombard-like carrot-orange hair, cut wildly long enough to show the nape of her neck, and rubs it against her cheek! Is the hair bouncing like her ears, swinging on either side of her head, set? Is it a sleeping habit?

My body was also trapped between the huge chest armor, and I could not move!

<blank>

Behind me, an accusing voice came from behind me.

<blank>

Aa, Alia! What are you saying to Sue again?

<blank>

Mia took me away from Aria, shouting, "I am not a child of God, I am a child of God!

<blank>

Nyub?

Sue is not going anywhere!

<blank>

As it is, buried in Mia's depraved flesh....

Oh, it's so soft. As I was savoring the feeling of being buried in the softness, a voice came from the side.

<blank>

What are you doing on the day of the ceremony?

Well, it's business as usual for Sue.

Mia! Bibi, Colin, did you come to see me off?"

<blank>

Bibi and Colin were also with Mia.

But I don't think this situation is my fault...I dare not say anything.

Because! Because it feels good to be buried!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Miss. It is time for you to go."

<blank>

As I was being escorted off by Bibi and the others, Mr. Karon, who was at the entrance to the Tsumesho, called me over.

I enter the Tsumesho without being prompted.

He was taken directly to a room in the Tsumesho.

Bibi and the other three people who saw him off are with him.

I was taken to a room that looked like a small conference room.

One gentleman was waiting for me in it.

This is Mr. Alphonse Beers, the patriarch of the Beers family, one of the three Amcam families.

<blank>

Mr. Alphonse here will be in charge of today's ceremony.

It is the job of the three families to send their children away.

<blank>

On behalf of all of us at AMCAM Village, I would like to congratulate you on this day. On behalf of the village of Amkam, I would like to congratulate you on this day.

<blank>

Mr. Alphonse is a stylish man with short, light brown hair and a trimmed mustache.

He is slightly taller than Aria.

He greeted us with his well-defined baritone voice.

His voice is so youthful that it is hard to believe he is in his fifties.

<blank>

Thank you very much for your kind attention, Mr. Alphonse. I am sorry to trouble you all at this time, and I thank you in advance for your kind attention."

<blank>

I thanked Mr. Alphonse for his kind words as I bailed.

<blank>

I know you already understand this, but I would like to reiterate it. You will now go to the Amukamu Forest and survive for one week alone. You will have no one to help you, and you will have to feed, sleep, and watch out for beasts all by yourself. Are you ready for this?"

Yes, I am ready. I, Suzy Cloud, pledge to survive the Amkamu Forest on my own and return to this land alive.

"Very well. This way, then."

<blank>

Alphonse-san nodded and signaled to Kalon-san, who was standing next to him.

Mr. Caron opened a postcard-sized wooden box in his hand and presented it to Mr. Alphonse.

Alphonse took out a piece of metal connected to a chain from a box covered with a blue lamé cloth, held it up reverently with both hands, and presented it to me so that I could see it.

<blank>

This is your tag. Please take good care of it."

<blank>

After whispering that quietly....

<blank>

May God protect our little ones.

<blank>

He shouted, spreading the chain of the tag with both hands, and brought it closer to me. In response, I got down on one knee and hung my head as if to offer it to Mr. Alphonse.

Alphonse-san placed a tag around my neck.

I picked up the piece of metal around my neck and checked the inscription on it.

<blank>

The words "Suzy Cloud" etched into a brand new metal plate.

<blank>

I find my mouth tearing open on its own.

I'm getting excited!

<blank>

'Now then, Suzy, clasp that tag to your chest and say your vows.

<blank>

I suppress my feelings of agitation, and at Alphonse's urging, I grab the tag and spin the words.

<blank>

The people of Amukam are the children of Yenna. It is my duty to preserve their lives until the time when they return to the land of Yenna. I swear to you that I will return to this land without neglecting myself."

<blank>

He chanted the words he had been taught as if he were singing, without mistaking a single word.

This seems to be a kind of congratulatory message.

<blank>

The name "Jenna" is the local goddess of the earth.

The fall harvest festival is also dedicated to Jenna.

This celebration is to take refuge in Jenna, the earth mother goddess, in order to obtain her blessing in the land of Amkam, where survival is difficult.

<blank>

As he finished his words, the temple design on the wall behind Mr. Alphonse glowed faintly.

And just like that, a faint pillar of light enveloped me.

<blank>

The covenant is made. "Little child, go forth with your little feet to fulfill your oath."

<blank>

The door is opened with Mr. Alphonse's words.

I proceeded as prompted, and Mr. Karon handed me my luggage at the door.

As I looked around the room with the help of Mr. Karon, I saw Mia, Bibi, and Colin, who had been watching over me during the ceremony.

Mia said, "Good luck! Bibi said, "You've got to do it right! and Colin said, "Have a good day!

I responded, "I'm off! I turned around and walked out through the door.

<blank>

We are not allowed to look back from this point on.

<blank>

Behind the Tsumesho is an open 20 meter square plaza, beyond which a path has been paved and leads deeper into the forest.

At the entrance to the forest, four members of the group were waiting for us.

It's the four members of Team Aria. Aria grins, the corners of her mouth turning up and her head twitching as if to say, Koch is your place.

<blank>

Blessed be the Yienna of the earth to the infant!"

<blank>

As we walked into the forest, Alphonse's baritone voice came loudly from behind us.

<blank>

Alia, Ilta, and Ketty and Millie disappear into the woods.

I follow them into the forest.

He gripped the tag that had just come into his possession tightly.

Deep in the forest, where no light can penetrate, he walks straight ahead, looking straight ahead.

Finally, the "coming of age ceremony" is about to begin!



<blank>

----------------

Susie: "Is Dana not here?"

Colin: "I did pick you up..."

Beatrice: "I woke you up by taking away your pillow!"

Mia "...but no matter how I tried, it just didn't happen."

Susie: "...yeah, I kind of knew that."

Next time: "Survival of Suzy Cloud, Part 1"
