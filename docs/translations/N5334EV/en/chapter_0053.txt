# Episode 48: Suzy Cloud, 14 Years Old, in the Morning

Before the sun peeks over the horizon.

The morning air is still cold and prickles the skin.

<b>

The sky, tinged with white just before dawn, is clear of clouds as I load the carriage with my belongings, my breath visible in the chilly air.

<b>

The carriage does not belong to our family; it is provided by the village.

<b>

Helping me load the luggage from the driver's seat is Mr. Karon Clunot, who came to pick me up from the village.

He is a 19-year-old who just moved up to the second tier this year.

<b>

"Karon, I’m counting on you."

"Y-yes! Leave it to me!!"

<b>

At the moment we finished loading the luggage, Karon was standing at attention in the driver's seat, responding to Papa Howard with a nervous voice.

<b>

Those who take the "Trial" must leave home alone on their birthday before dawn.

<b>

While the village sends someone to pick me up, my family can only see me off from home and cannot accompany me.

<b>

Once the luggage was loaded, Mama Sonia and Ms. Elrose called out to me.

<b>

"Take care, Suzy…"

"Safe travels, young lady."

"Yes! I’m off now!"

<b>

I replied cheerfully to both of them.

<b>

"Make sure not to overdo it, alright?"

"Yes! I’ll be fine, I’ll take it easy!"

<b>

I also smiled at Papa Howard.

<b>

Before stepping outside the house, I received congratulatory words from Papa Howard, Mama Sonia, and Ms. Elrose for my birthday.

At that moment, they embraced me with congratulations, and the warmth that still lingers on my arms and cheeks feels even more pronounced against the cold air outside.

<b>

It seems that the adults in my family have been overly protective lately.

The cause lies in the fact that I burst into tears during dinner the day before yesterday… Oh, how embarrassing it is to recall this black history!

Papa Howard says, "If you feel lonely, always ask for help from those around you."

D-do they think I’m going to cry again?!

<b>

"I-I’ll be fine! I’ll show you that I can do this!"

<b>

While my heart felt slightly strained, I clenched my hands tightly and smiled.

<b>

With Karon's help, I boarded the carriage.

Then Karon announced, "We’re off," and the carriage began to move.

<b>

The eastern sky was starting to turn red.

The sun was about to rise.

Those taking the "Trial" must leave home before the sun rises.

<b>

Waving goodbye from the moving carriage, I greeted Papa Howard, Mama Sonia, and Ms. Elrose as they saw me off.

The three stood there, watching me until I was out of sight.

Down the hill, until I could no longer see them...

Ah, oh no, I’m really about to cry!

<b>

"You are loved by everyone, aren’t you, young lady…"

<b>

Karon said quietly.

<b>

"Papa Howard, Mama Sonia, and Ms. Elrose, they are all very kind…"

<b>

Karon smiled and replied, then focused straight ahead as he drove the carriage.

<b>

Karon is a nice person… He seems to be considerate.

It seems he is trying not to notice my teary eyes.

I buried my face in the cloak I was wearing and sniffled a little.

<b>

<b>

As the carriage moved forward, the sun began to rise, and the sky was dyed in the morning glow.

Both the sky and the earth, the world was painted in dawn colors.

It is a world that exists only for a moment in the morning.

In this world, Karon silently urged the carriage onward.

Our destination is the First Outpost.

<b>

<b>

When the sun had fully risen and the colors of the sky had settled, we arrived at the outpost.

<b>

Members of the group were already waiting in front of the outpost.

<b>

"Congratulations! Young lady. We look forward to working with you for the next week!"

"Thank you, Ms. Millie! I appreciate your help!"

<b>

The first person to congratulate me as I got off the carriage was Millie from Cecily's shop.

<b>

Ms. Millie is one of the four members of the group who will take care of me for the week.

<b>

The "Rite of Passage" trial.

A week of survival in the Amukam Forest. In other words, camping.

<b>

During the week of camping, the members will watch over me from a distance and provide protection.

<b>

Moreover, the protection will be provided by capable individuals from the mid-tier and upper-tier ranks.

It’s a luxurious arrangement of one child with several mid- to upper-tier members! It’s quite a hassle for them!

<b>

Ms. Millie Barrett is a scout, dressed in dark leather armor.

Her slender body and the white thighs peeking out from her hot pants are dazzling!

<b>

<b>

"Congratulations today, Miss Cloud. I look forward to working with you from today."

"Thank you! I look forward to working with you, Ms. Ilta!"

<b>

Ms. Ilta Lindman is an 8th-tier healer.

At 22 years old, she is a priestess.

In other words, she is a remarkable individual on par with a high priest.

When we shook hands, I caught a glimpse of a bustle skirt and corset peeking out from her cloak.

It seems Ms. Ilta is also following the current fashion trends.

I was taken aback by the sight of her white legs peeking from the bustle skirt.

With a noticeable bust even from under her cloak, despite being a cleric, she seems to be the sexy type! How scandalous!

<b>

<b>

"Congratulations, Miss Suzy Cloud. I will accompany you for the next week."

"Thank you, Ms. Keti! I appreciate your help for the week!"

<b>

Ms. Keti Forest is a warlock who has mastered summoning magic.

At 21 years old, she is a 7th-tier mid-tier member.

The warlock's summoning magic is versatile, capable of offense, defense, and support, allowing one person to fulfill multiple roles, yet it is said to be difficult to master.

However, Ms. Keti, who can wield it, is indeed talented, and Papa Howard mentioned that she will soon rise to the upper tier.

<b>

<b>

"Happy birthday, Suzy! For the next week, I’ll make sure to guard you well!"

"Meow… Ah, thank you, Aria! I look forward to working with you, okay?"

<b>

After exchanging greetings with the three, I was hugged by the fourth, Aria, who offered her congratulations.

<b>

<b>

Aria Blouk is the eldest daughter of the Blouk family.

Yes, she is Ronbart's older sister, the same age as me.

<b>

We often see each other at the training grounds where family members often instruct.

<b>

<b>

Aria, at just 24 years old, holds the highest rank of 10th and is a battle master.

The combat style of the Blouk family, one of the twelve teams of Amukam,

involves smashing enemies with a battle axe and using it for defense, embodying both offense and defense.

While both Ronbart and Aria share this style, Aria's combat power as a battle master is incomparable to Ronbart's.

She is already said to be able to suppress an entire battalion by herself.

Papa Howard mentioned that she would soon be awarded an "A."

<b>

By the way, "A" is a title given to those who have risen to the 10th tier and are recognized for their significant strength.

It is called a "Grade," with "A," "AA," and the highest rank "AAA."

Once someone holds a grade, their name becomes known both inside and outside, and they may have a nickname.

Like Rider's "Golden Vampire Slayer"! By the way, Rider is said to be "AA."

Once a name becomes known, requests for protection of important figures in the royal capital or local cities, as well as requests for monster extermination, come in.

<b>

It seems that this is the largest source of income for Amukam.

After all, having the strength to face a battalion alone is quite something.

The fee for an "A" request is said to be at least equivalent to the annual income of ten knights! Isn’t that outrageous?!

<b>

Additionally, Papa Howard has retired from the front lines, so he is now considered "A"…

To be "A" after retiring, Papa Howard seems quite something…

I secretly vow that I will never become a "Grade Holder" or earn a nickname!

<b>

When I think about it calmly, the military strength of Amukam seems quite absurd…? To overwhelm a knight's group by oneself is just too much?! There are several people like that… I can’t understand why the country allows such military strength!

<b>

<b>

<b>

And speaking of Aria, while still hugging me, she rubbed her cheek against mine…

"Now you can come to our house anytime as a bride! Yes, yes!"

<b>

She said something like that!

<b>

"I-I’m not going, and there’s no talk of marriage! I-I have nothing to do with Ron!"

"Not Ron, but my bride! You understand, right? Hehe♪"

"Nyah! N-no, that’s not happening! Nnnyahhh!"

<b>

While saying such things, Aria tightened her hug and rubbed against me!

<b>

Aria’s body, like the Blouk family, is large.

She is nearly 180 centimeters tall, with strong muscles like an athlete, but not clumsy.

Her body is toned yet protected by just the right amount of fat, with a striking hourglass figure!

Underneath that cloak, she wears a daring bikini armor made from monster leather that wraps around her ample bosom, making her a dynamite figure!!

Aria has carrot-orange hair cut wild, reminiscent of the Blouk family, swaying as she rubs her cheek against mine! The hair bouncing at the sides of her head— is it styled? Or bedhead??

My body is trapped between her massive chest armor, unable to move, and I’m just overwhelmed!

<b>

From behind me, a voice of reproach rang out.

<b>

"Ar-Aria! What are you saying to Su-chan again?!"

<b>

Mia shouted as she snatched me away from Aria!

<b>

"Nyah?!"

"Su-chan isn’t going anywhere to get married!!"

<b>

I was immediately buried in Mia's soft body…

Ah, so soft. As I enjoyed the feeling of being enveloped, another voice came from the side.

<b>

"What are you doing on the day of the ceremony?!"

"Well, it’s just typical Su behavior."

"Mia! Did Bibi and Colin come to see you off?"

<b>

Bibi and Colin were also beside Mia.

But in this situation, I don’t think it’s my fault… I chose not to say anything.

Because being buried like this feels good!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Young lady. It’s almost time."

<b>

As I was being seen off by Bibi and the others, I was called by Karon, who was at the entrance of the outpost.

I followed his prompt and entered the outpost.

I was then guided to a room inside the outpost.

Bibi and the others who were seeing me off came along too.

The room I was led to looked like a small conference room.

Inside, a gentleman was waiting for me.

He was Alphonse Bias, the head of the Bias family, one of the three great families of Amukam.

<b>

Today’s ceremony will be overseen by Mr. Alphonse.

It seems that sending off children is the duty of the three great families.

<b>

"Congratulations, Suzy. On behalf of the village of Amukam, I celebrate your arrival at this day."

<b>

Mr. Alphonse has short, slightly wavy light brown hair and a stylish mustache.

He is slightly taller than Aria.

His baritone voice greeted me warmly,

sounding youthful for someone in his 50s.

<b>

"Thank you very much, Mr. Alphonse. I appreciate everyone’s efforts in this matter."

<b>

I expressed my gratitude with a bow in response to Mr. Alphonse's words.

<b>

"I believe you understand well enough, but I will reiterate. You must now go to the Amukam Forest and survive alone for a week. You will have no one to assist you, and you must handle all meals, sleeping arrangements, and vigilance against beasts by yourself. Are you prepared?"

"Yes, I am fully prepared. I, Suzy Cloud, swear to survive in the Amukam Forest with my own strength and return to this land alive."

"Very well. Then, here you go."

<b>

Saying this, Mr. Alphonse nodded to Karon, who was standing nearby.

Karon opened a postcard-sized wooden box he was holding and presented it to Mr. Alphonse.

Mr. Alphonse took out a metal piece connected by a chain from the box covered in blue glittering fabric, holding it reverently with both hands and offering it to me.

<b>

"This will be your tag. Please keep it safe."

<b>

After whispering this softly…

<b>

"May our young one be protected."

<b>

He raised his voice, spreading the chain of the tag with both hands and bringing it closer to me. I knelt down and bowed my head as if to present it to Mr. Alphonse.

He gently placed the tag around my neck.

I picked up the metal piece hanging from my neck and checked the engraved letters.

<b>

The letters "Suzy Cloud" were inscribed on the brand-new metal plate.

<b>

I could feel my mouth breaking into a smile.

I’m getting excited!

<b>

"Now, Suzy, hold that tag to your chest and recite the words of the oath."

<b>

I suppressed my eager feelings and, following Mr. Alphonse's prompt, held the tag and began to weave the words.

<b>

"The people of Amukam are children of Yenna. Until the time we return to the earth of Yenna, it is my duty to sustain this life. I vow to return to this land without neglecting my own body."

<b>

I recited the words I had learned without making a single mistake, singing them aloud.

It seems this is a kind of prayer.

<b>

"Yenna" is the earth goddess of this region.

The autumn harvest festival is also dedicated to Yenna.

This prayer is meant to gain her blessing by devoting oneself to the earth goddess, especially in the harsh land of Amukam.

<b>

Once I finished weaving the words, the pattern of the temple displayed on the wall behind Mr. Alphonse began to glow faintly.

Then, a soft pillar of light enveloped me.

<b>

"The pact is sealed. Young one, step forward to fulfill your oath with those small feet."

<b>

With Mr. Alphonse's words, the door swung open.

Prompted, I stepped forward, and at the door, Karon handed me my luggage.

As I shouldered the large load with Karon's help and looked around the room, I made eye contact with Mia, Bibi, and Colin, who had been watching over me during the ceremony.

Mia mouthed (Do your best!), Bibi (Make sure to do well!), and Colin (Safe travels), cheering me on with their expressions.

I responded with (I’m off!) before turning forward and stepping through the door outside.

<b>

From here on, I am not allowed to look back.

<b>

Behind the outpost, a square of about 20 meters opened up, leading to a path that continues into the depths of the forest.

At the entrance of that forest, four members of the group were waiting.

The four from Team Aria. Aria smirked, tilting her head as if to say, "This is your place."

<b>

"May the blessings of the earth goddess Yenna be upon the young one!"

<b>

As I began to walk into the forest, Mr. Alphonse's baritone voice echoed behind me.

<b>

Aria, Ilta, Keti, and Millie disappeared into the forest.

I followed them into the woods.

Gripping the tag that had just become mine tightly.

I began to walk straight into the depths of the forest, where light does not reach, focusing on what lies ahead.

Finally, the "Rite of Passage" is about to begin!

<b>

----------------

Suzy: "Is Dana not here?"

Colin: "I went to pick her up, but..."

Beatrice: "I took her pillow away to wake her up!"

Mia: "...But no matter what, she wouldn’t wake up."

Suzy: "...Yeah, I kind of figured that."
