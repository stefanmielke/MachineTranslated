# Chapter 113: Maguarat River First Wharf

The Maguarat River originates from three lakes in Litrepuel County, also known as "The Water Bottle of Nasanturka," and is a major river that flows northwest through Karais Province, where several tributaries converge.

<b>

Running parallel to the main road, this river flows from the north side of the town to Dekkenbel, gently changing its course at the foot of the hill where the Miria Castle Eye Boarding School is located, and flows southeast towards the center of the town.

Within the river flowing near the center of Dekkenbel, there is an island approximately 1 kilometer long and over 500 meters wide.

This island is called Urubu Island, and at its upstream western end is the largest river port in the town.

<b>

Dekkenbel has developed as a distribution center for Karais Province, utilizing the Maguarat River, alongside the main road connecting the royal capital to the north, for over 150 years.

<b>

<b>

<b>

That afternoon, Philip Cloud and his family visited the "Maguarat River First Wharf" located on Urubu Island.

<b>

After completing the entrance procedures at the main gate, they proceeded by carriage to near the unloading area of the first wharf, where a line of waiting freight wagons stood ready to be loaded.

<b>

To avoid interfering with the movement of the freight wagons, they stopped the carriage a little distance away, and when Philip Cloud peeked out from the door, a lively voice called out to him.

<b>

"Still as punctual as ever!"

"To have the lady herself come out to greet us, we are honored."

<b>

There stood a person welcoming them.

It was Colette Bear, the head of the Bear Trading Company, the largest cargo handler at this river port.

Colette looked up slightly at Philip as he stepped down from the carriage and shook hands with arms as strong as a man's.

<b>

"Madam, it's been a while. I'm glad to see you well. Young lady, you've grown! Was this your first year at school?"

"It has been a while, Colette. I'm relieved to see you well too."

"Long time no see, auntie. Yes! I've been attending the primary school since the other day."

<b>

Colette brushed back a few loose strands of hair that had fallen from her tightly gathered bun, softening her sharp gray eyes as she exchanged words with the mother and daughter.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Is it true that those two are important figures, to the extent that the consul general himself comes to visit?"

"Indeed, there's no doubt they're promising young people."

<b>

"The 'Golden Generation'... was it?"

"Some seem to call them that..."

<b>

Colette then guided the three members of the Cloud family to the unloading area, exchanging words with Philip while casting glances at two young workers there.

After watching the Cloud family for a while, Colette clapped her hands and raised her voice.

<b>

"Alright, everyone! It's a good time! Take a break!! Arvin! Lombard! Come over here!"

<b>

When called by Colette, Arvin and Lombard quickly approached the spot where Philip and the others were.

After greeting Philip, Colette spoke to the two.

<b>

"You two, take the young lady to the dining hall now."

"Annie, your father and I need to discuss some work with Colette. Can you stay with Arvin and Lombard for a little while?"

"Okay! Father!"

<b>

Annie smiled and nodded at her father's words about the adults' discussion.

<b>

Colette instructed Arvin and Lombard to take Annie to the dining hall and let her rest there. She was essentially asking them to act as Annie's bodyguards.

Philip understood that this was Colette's consideration, as it wouldn't be safe for a young girl to walk alone among the rough men in the port, and he smiled as he saw the three off.

<b>

"I can't do the 'technique' I learned from Arvin at all."

"Well, I only succeed about one in three times myself."

"…Is that so?"

"According to Suzy, it's important to gather 'ki' energy."

"Ki energy?"

"They say you gather it through breathing."

<b>

Annie spends some time in Amukam several times a year and interacts with the village children.

Right now, she was talking about the 'technique' she learned from Arvin during her winter stay in Amukam, where she participated in the children's training.

<b>

<b>

Having seen the children in Amukam learning 'skills' from Suzy and starting to use them, Annie had pleaded with Suzy to teach her as well.

At that time, Suzy had refused, saying, "You can't do it until your body is ready," "You need to build your stamina with running," and "Master your breathing technique properly first."

<b>

However, Annie, not willing to give up, secretly asked Arvin to teach her anything, without telling Suzy.

<b>

Arvin is one of the promising young people expected in Amukam.

He is highly regarded by Annie's brother William, and Annie has great trust in Arvin, along with a small admiration.

<b>

Annie earnestly sought Arvin's teachings.

<b>

At first, Arvin naturally refused, thinking he couldn't teach her without Suzy finding out.

But Annie's passionate insistence was very strong, and in the end, Arvin relented and taught her just one technique, saying, "If it's just for form's sake."

<b>

In fact, Suzy was aware that Arvin was teaching Annie the 'technique.'

<b>

However, since it was something that couldn't be done without refining 'ki' and was not a direct attack technique, Suzy thought there wouldn't be any danger and allowed it to continue.

<b>

But Annie, having learned the 'technique,' was overjoyed.

Now, she repeats that 'form' several times a day along with the breathing techniques she learned from Suzy.

<b>

"Hmm, when I breathe in and lower my waist, it feels like my legs want to move, but I guess I need to train more..."

"…I see. That's right, keep it up."

"Yes! I'll do my best!"

<b>

Isn't that the 'technique' about to activate? Arvin thought, holding his breath, but shook his head quietly, thinking it was still impossible.

<b>

<b>

"But you both are amazing! To carry such big loads all by yourselves!"

<b>

As she walked, Annie recalled how Arvin and Lombard had been working and praised the two.

She felt very proud that the two young people from Amukam were working alongside adults without any inferiority, or even better than them.

<b>

"Is that so? Well, it's good training for us."

"Is that so?"

"Suzy said so too, right? For strength work, 'if you consciously move your body, it becomes solid training.'"

<b>

"Yes! She said that! Sister Suzy said that!"

<b>

Annie, who had been running with Suzy and the others since early morning, remembered Suzy's words at that time.

<b>

"It's important to feel your own awareness while running," "Even for strength work, it's important to feel your center of gravity and be aware of your strength and relaxation," "Housework like cleaning and laundry can also be sufficient training if done with awareness."

<b>

Arvin and Sister Suzy are always training while doing 'work.'

Then, she wanted to try doing some 'work' while training too!

<b>

At that moment, Annie strongly thought so.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"That's the dining hall over there. Wait here for a moment; I'll go ask if we can go in. Ron, take care of Annie."

<b>

Stopping in front of a building, Arvin told Annie to wait there.

Lombard nodded silently, and Annie watched Arvin enter the building that was said to be the dining hall.

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was almost at the same time that Arvin disappeared into the front entrance.

Suddenly, a plain door on the side of the building opened right in front of Annie, and two things that looked like fur balls tumbled out.

At the same time, a rough voice echoed around.

<b>

"Just go home! This isn't a playground for kids!!"

<b>

The door on the side of the building was probably a back entrance.

A large man wearing a dirty apron shouted loudly at the fur balls that had tumbled out.

<b>

"Please!"

"Please!"

<b>

What had looked like fur balls were actually small children.

Two children had tumbled out, rolling outside.

<b>

Annie, realizing this, couldn't help but widen her eyes.

<b>

"Get home before you get hurt, you brats!!"

"Please, no!"

"Please, we beg you!"

"Shut up! Just go home!"

<b>

"I think it's ridiculous for a big adult to bully such small children!"

<b>

Before she knew it, Annie had stepped in front of the children and was throwing a stern gaze and words at the man.

<b>

"N-no! Young lady! I'm not being rough?!"

"Even so! The way you speak and your attitude towards small children is unacceptable!"

"I've always been like this!"

<b>

The man who had come out of the building was momentarily at a loss for words at Annie's fierce demeanor.

<b>

<b>

"What’s going on, Annie?! What are you doing, Toby?"

<b>

Arvin, who had come out of the building, widened his eyes at the fierce little girl and then cast a look of disbelief at the intimidating man who was cowering before her.
