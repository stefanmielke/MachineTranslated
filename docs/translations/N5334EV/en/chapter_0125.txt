# 113 The First Wharf of the Magualat River

The Magualat River, also known as the "Water Bottle of Nasantorca," originates from three lakes in the county of Litre Puer, where it is intersected by several tributaries and traverses the state of Caraiz from the northwest.

The river, which runs parallel to the main street and reaches De Kembel from the north side of the city, gently changes course at the foot of the high plateau where the Milia Castellai boarding school is located, and flows down in a southeasterly direction almost in the center of the city.

In that river, which flows near the center of De Kembel, there is a mid-bank about 1 km long and more than 500 meters wide.

This middle island was called Ulubu Island, and the city's largest river port was located on its upstream side, at the western end of the island.

Dekenbel, along with the Grand Highway that connects the royal city to the north, has been the distribution center of the province of Calais, using this Magualat River, for more than 150 years.

Philip Cloud and his family were visiting the "First Wharf of the Maguarat River" here on the island of Urb that afternoon.

<blank>

After completing the entry procedures at the main gate, we proceeded by horse-drawn carriage to the unloading area at pier No. 1, where we found an orderly line of wagons waiting to unload our cargo.

<blank>

Philip Cloud, who had the wagon stop a short distance away so as not to disturb the movement of the wagon, peeked out the door, where he was greeted by a booming voice.

<blank>

You are as punctual as ever!"

It's very kind of you to go out of your way to greet her yourself."

<blank>

There was a person standing there to greet them.

It is Colette Bair of the Bair Trading Company, the largest contractor of cargo handling at this river port.

Colette looks up slightly at Philippe as he steps out of the carriage and shakes his hand with arms as strong as a man's.

<blank>

It's been a while since I've seen you, Mrs. Oku. I am glad to see you are well. Your daughter has grown up, hasn't she? Did you start school this year?"

Colette: "It's been a while, Colette. I'm glad to see you're doing well."

Good to see you again, Auntie. Yes, it has been a while! I've been coming to the elementary school since the other day.

<blank>

Colette brushed back the stragglers that had unraveled and fallen out of her hair, which was pulled back in a tight bun, and gently untangled her sharp gray eyes, then turned to the mother and child to speak.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Are those two people important enough for the consul general to go to all that trouble?"

Yes, he is definitely a promising young man."

<blank>

Was it "The Golden Generation," ......?"

I see some are calling it that. ......

<blank>

As it was, Colette took the three members of the Cloud family to the unloading area, where she and Philip exchanged a few words as she looked at the two young men working there.

Colette, who had been watching the work with the Cloud family for a while, clapped her hands loudly on the spot and shouted.

<blank>

Good times! Guys! Take a breather! Irving! Lombard! Come here!

<blank>

Irving and Lombardo, as Colette called them, came trotting up to where Philip and the others were.

Colette addresses the two men, who greet Philip on the spot.

<blank>

Both of you will now escort the young lady to the diner.

'Annie, I have to talk to Colette about some business now. Can you stay with Irvin and the others for a little while?"

I understand! Father!"

<blank>

Annie smiled and nodded when her father said the adults needed to talk.

<blank>

Colette tells Irving and Lombardo to take Annie to the diner and give her some rest there. He asks them to act as Annie's bodyguards.

Philip understood that Colette was thinking that she could not let the little girl walk alone in the harbor where these boorish bastards were strolling about, and he saw them off with a smile.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I can't seem to do any of the 'tricks' that Irving taught me."

Well, I only succeed one out of three times."

...... I see."

Suzy says it's all about building up your Ki energy.

"Ability?"

He said they build it up by breathing."

<blank>

Annie spends time in Amkam several times a year and interacts with the village children.

Now, when I was in Amcam this past winter, I attended a children's training and was talking about the 'techniques' that Irving taught me there.

<blank>

<blank>

When Annie saw that the children of Amkam were learning the skills from Suzy and beginning to use them, she appealed to Suzy to teach them to her as well.

At that time, Susie had refused my request, telling me that I could not start until my body was ready, that I had to build up my strength by running and so on, and that I had to master breathing techniques thoroughly.

<blank>

However, Annie still couldn't give up, so she asked Irving to teach her anything he wanted to know, without telling Susie.

<blank>

Irvin is one of the most promising young people in Amcam.

He was highly regarded by Annie's brother, William, and Annie had great trust in Irving. With a small admiration.

<blank>

Annie was very, very eager to learn from Irving.

<blank>

At first, Irving refused to teach behind Suzy's back, as he should have.

But Annie's enthusiastic push was so strong that Irving eventually broke down and taught her one thing: "If it's just a formality," he said.

<blank>

As a matter of fact, Suzy was aware that Irving had been teaching Annie "tricks".

<blank>

However, since it was not a direct attack technique and could not be done without training in "Ki," it was not dangerous and was left to be done as it was.

<blank>

But Annie is overjoyed to learn the 'tricks'.

I still repeat that "kata" many times a day, along with the breathing exercises that Suzy taught me.

<blank>

I'm not sure if I need more training or not. ......

"...... yeah, right. Yeah, good luck with that."

I'll do my best! I'll do my best!"

<blank>

Isn't that a "technique" about to go off? Irving gulps, but shakes his head quietly, "I don't think it's possible yet.

<blank>

<blank>

But it's amazing, both of you, that you can carry such a big load all by yourselves!"

<blank>

As she continued on her feet, Annie remembered the way Irving and the others had worked, and she admired them both.

<blank>

She was very proud of the fact that the two young people from Amcam were working with adults in no way inferior to, or even better than, the adults.

<blank>

'Oh yeah? Well, it's a nice workout."

Really?"

"Suzy said, 'Hard work is a good workout if you are conscious of it. "Suzy said that hard work is a good workout if you're conscious of your body's movements.

<blank>

Yeah! She said! Sister Sue said it!"

<blank>

Annie, who had been running with Suzy and the others who had been training early this morning, remembered Suzy's words at that time.

<blank>

It is important to feel one's own consciousness while running, to feel one's own center of gravity and to be aware of one's own strength and weakness, even in hard work, and even housework such as cleaning and washing can be a good workout if done with awareness.

<blank>

Irving and Sue are always training even though they are doing their "work".

Then I would like to do some training while doing some 'work' myself!

<blank>

Annie felt strongly about this at the time.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

That's the cafeteria. Wait here for a minute, and I'll ask if I can come in now. Ron, take care of Annie."

<blank>

Stopping in front of one of the buildings, Irving told Annie to wait here.

Lombardo nodded silently, and Annie followed Irving with her eyes as he walked into the building he said was the dining room.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was about the same time that Irving disappeared inside through the front entrance.

A simple door attached to the side of the building suddenly opened in front of Annie's eyes, and two furball-like objects rolled out from inside.

At the same time, a coarse voice echoed around the area.

<blank>

Just go home! This ain't no place for kids to play!

<blank>

That door on the side of the building is probably a kitchen door.

A large man wearing a flimsy apron shouted so loudly through that doorway to the furball that had just popped out ahead of him.

<blank>

Oh, please!"

Please!"

<blank>

It looked like a furball, it was a small child.

Two children came running outside like they were rolling.

<blank>

Annie was blindsided when she noticed this.

<blank>

Go home before you get hurt! Go home before you get hurt!

Oh, no!

I'm begging you!"

Shut up! Just go home!"

<blank>

I think it's crazy for a big man to rampage against such a little boy!"

<blank>

Before I knew it, Annie was standing in front of the children, facing the man and giving him a stern look and a few words.

<blank>

No, no! Sweetheart! I didn't hurt you, did I?

But still! I don't think that's the way to address a small child, or even a big one!"

I've always been like this!"

<blank>

A man comes out of the building and is stumped by Annie's sudden and caustic appearance.

<blank>

<blank>

What's up, Annie? What are you doing? Toby."

<blank>

Irving came out of the building, his eyes widening at the sight of the raging little girl, and at the same time, he looked with dismay at the stern-faced man who was intimidated by her.
