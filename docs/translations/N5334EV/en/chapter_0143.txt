# Chapter 131: The Proof of Protection

"Hey, Lucille? Is this really the right place?"

"Yes, this is definitely the right place."

"I-I see... Since Lucille investigated it, it must be correct, but..."

<b>

I trust Lucille's investigative abilities. However, even if I'm told this is the place, I can't help but have doubts.

<b>

<b>

After all, that child has enrolled in the Miria Castle Eye.

If the young children of her relatives have nowhere to go, there is a system in place for the academy to provide a place for them, as Cordelia had learned from her father before leaving the country.

<b>

<b>

"You don't need to worry, my dear Cordelia. It's not a common occurrence, but there are facilities and systems in place at the academy to protect such children. The fact that Kane and Leela's children have been accepted into the academy means they will be under the academy's protection. That academy will protect those children."

<b>

When Cordelia learned that she would be coming to the academy.

Her father, Bonar Raven Casper, looked at her with affectionate eyes through his blond hair, as he spoke about what would happen to her young siblings.

<b>

"So, my beloved Cordelia. I want to send you this from me. ...As a custom of our family, this is something sent from parents to a child embarking on a journey. I believe this will surely protect you. May you and your friends have much happiness..."

<b>

The item sent by her father was a small brooch with a golden stone embedded in it.

Cordelia recalled her father's words and gently placed her hand over her chest pocket.

<b>

At the academy, wearing decorative items in visible places is prohibited.

Cordelia had been instructed to keep it close at all times, so she always concealed the brooch in her chest pocket.

<b>

Feeling its presence through the pocket, she remembered her father's words: "It will protect those children."

<b>

But what is the reality? The young twins are not in a facility within the academy but in a facility outside, in a place like this.

<b>

The surrounding buildings and cobblestones are hardly well-kept.

There seem to be several discarded bottles along the way to this place, suggesting there might be a bustling area nearby.

To Cordelia, this did not seem like a suitable place for small children to spend time.

<b>

<b>

Lucille had chosen "Spatial Surveillance" as her elective class and aspired to be a ranger.

Her investigative abilities are reliable, and I trust her more than anyone else.

However, Cordelia's mind continued to be confused, unable to find any commonality between the story her father told her and the reality before her.

<b>

"Even so, you are impressive, Lady Cordelia."

<b>

Katherine spoke to the confused Cordelia, crossing her arms as if to express her admiration.

<b>

"Since you weren't acknowledged at the store, the idea of waiting at the place she would likely return to is quite clever. It's not something most people can easily come up with. Truly, Lady Cordelia."

<b>

<b>

If I can't talk at the store, then there's no choice but to talk outside after work!

According to Lord Cloud, she will finish work in about an hour, as she is leaving a bit early today.

Then I can go to where she will return and wait, and we can talk there!

<b>

Cordelia felt her spirits lift at this idea and arrived at the place Lucille had investigated with a flourish.

<b>

Why did Lucille investigate this place in advance? Cordelia didn't question it.

Only Katherine raised an eyebrow slightly, thinking, "She must have read Cordelia's actions in advance," and accepted her excellent cousin's behavior.

<b>

<b>

Now Cordelia felt that her idea had been acknowledged, and to blow away her previous anxieties, she tossed her curly blond hair back with a huff!

<b>

"Is that so? W-Well, for someone like me, this level of thinking is..."

<b>

"That stalker-like quality of yours is quite creepy, and I think it's very good."

"..........................Eh?"

<b>

Suddenly, the light faded from Cordelia's eyes, and with a puzzled expression, she tilted her head, her voice flat as it escaped her lips.

<b>

"Truly, Lady Cordelia."

"Eh? I-I... Huh? Stalk...? Eh?"

"That's not the case at all! That's not the case at all, Lady Cordelia!!"

"B-But I... with that child... Huh?"

<b>

"Don't worry, Lady Cordelia! I'm sure she will be happy to talk calmly!"

"B-But, c-creepy...? ...Huh? Eh? Huh?"

"That lack of self-awareness is truly admirable."

"Enough! Katherine!! Stop it already!!"

<b>

Cordelia, trembling and looking vacant, was acting suspiciously.

Katherine nodded repeatedly with a satisfied expression.

Lucille kept reassuring her, saying everything would be alright.

<b>

A truly chaotic scene unfolded abruptly in that place.

<b>

<b>

"Do you have business here?"

<b>

And then, cutting through the atmosphere among them, someone suddenly spoke from behind.
