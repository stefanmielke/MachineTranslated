# 131 - A Testament of Protection

"Hey, Lucille? Are you sure this is the right place?"

Yes, this is the right place.

So, yes, ....... Lucille checked it out for me, so I'm sure it's correct. ......"

<blank>

I trust Lucille's investigative skills. However, I can only wonder if this is the case here.

<blank>

<blank>

She is, after all, enrolled at Milia Castel Eye.

Before leaving the country, Cordelia had learned from her father that if there was no place for her people's young children to go, the school would provide a place for them.

<blank>

<blank>

Don't worry, my sweet Cody. It's not every day that a case like this comes along, but the school has facilities and systems in place to protect these children. If they are admitted to the school, Kane and Leela's children will be placed in the care of the school. His school will protect them.

<blank>

When Cordilia learned that she was coming to the academy.

What will happen to her little siblings? Her father, Bona Raven Casper, was asked, staring lovingly at her through blonde hair that looked so much like his daughter's, and told her.

<blank>

'So, my dear Cody. I send this to you. ...... As is the custom in my family, it is sent by parents to their departing children. I trust it will protect you. I wish you and your friends all the best. ......

<blank>

My father sent me a small brooch inlaid with golden stones.

Cordelia remembered her father's words and gently placed her hand over her breast pocket.

<blank>

At the academy, it is forbidden to wear ornaments in visible places.

Cordilia, who had been told to keep the brooch close at hand, always carried it in her breast pocket.

<blank>

As I feel its presence through my pocket, I remember my father's words, 'They will protect those children.

<blank>

But what about the truth? The young twins say they are not in an on-campus facility, but in an off-campus facility, and in a place like this.

<blank>

The surrounding buildings and cobblestones are hardly in good order.

I also saw several liquor bottles lying around before I came to this place, as if there is a downtown area nearby.

From Cordelia's point of view, this did not seem like a good place for a small child to spend time.

<blank>

<blank>

Lucille is also an aspiring ranger who chose "Space Patrol" as her elective class.

Her research skills are solid, and I trust her more than anyone else.

However, Cordelia's head continued to spin as she could not find any similarities between the story her father had told her and the reality that now lay before her.

<blank>

But then again, that's just brilliant, Mr. Cordelia."

<blank>

Catherine, looking at Cordelia in confusion, folded her arms as if to say that she was impressed with her.

<blank>

The idea of staking out a place where they are likely to come back because they were not taken seriously at the store. Normally, this would not be possible. Cordelia is a master.

<blank>

<blank>

If you can't talk to them at the store, it can't be helped.

Then we can talk outside after work!

Mr. Cloud said that she is leaving a little early today and will be done with her work in an hour.

Then you can go ahead and wait for her where she is going to leave and talk to her there!

<blank>

Cordelia was excited by her idea and dashed over to this place that Lucille had researched beforehand.

<blank>

Why had Lucille researched this place beforehand? Cordelia does not raise such questions.

Only Catherine, however, raised her eyebrows slightly, "You read Cordelia's behavior in advance," and one person was satisfied with this excellent cousin's behavior.

<blank>

<blank>

Now that Cordelia had been approved of her idea, she brushed away any worries she might have had! She brushed away the blonde curls that were draped over her shoulders.

<blank>

I'm not sure I'm the only one. Well, well, if you're anything like me, this is the level of thought that goes into ......"

<blank>

I think its stalker-ness is really quixotic."

"........................ yeah?"

<blank>

Instantly, the luster disappears from Cordelia's eyes, she tilts her head curiously with her eyes wide open, and a hushed voice escapes from her mouth.

<blank>

It's like Cordelia."

What? Wow, I ............ what? Sto ......? Yeah?"

I don't think so! No, it's not true, Miss Cordelia!

'Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna go to ............ with her, eh?"

<blank>

I'm sure she'll be happy to be able to talk to you calmly! I'm sure she'll be glad to be able to talk to you so calmly!"

"So, but, ki, kisho ......? What about ......? Huh? Huh?"

Your unawareness is very precious.

Oh my god! Catherine! That's enough!

<blank>

Cordelia is acting suspiciously, her eyes empty and shaking with a pull.

Catherine nodded her head with a satisfied look on her face.

Lucille repeats over and over again that it's okay.

<blank>

A truly chaotic picture suddenly unfolds on the spot.

<blank>

<blank>

What can I get for you here?

<blank>

Then, as if to cut through their air, someone suddenly called out to them from behind.
