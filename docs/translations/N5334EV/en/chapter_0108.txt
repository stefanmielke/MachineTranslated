# 96 Weekend Revelation

I know the subtitle is a bit grandiose, but it is a very personal viewpoint.


----------------

<blank>

"Well, this is ...... and this is where I work, ......?"

Wow, it's a more magnificent creation than I thought!"

<blank>

We arrived in front of a cute building with beautiful white walls.

The construction is just as Bibi described, with the four corners of the building built up with bricks, and the windows and doors are massive and solid.

<blank>

Yes, this is the owner. Oh, thank you again today, owner."

'Well, well, well, Mistress Selkie and Mistress Merle! Good day to you too! Oh? Are you ladies here for today's appointment?"

Yes, this will be my first job today. Please do not hesitate to contact me."

No, no, no! It's nice to meet you too! As expected of the students of the school. They are all very well rounded! No, no, no! Thank you so much!

<blank>

As I gazed up at the building we had arrived at, I was greeted by a person who came out of the building, whom Mr. Selkie called the owner (......), and introduced us.

He was a well-dressed gentleman with a kindly, whimsical air about him, and seemed to be a good-looking person. I would say he was in his late 30s or 40s.

<blank>

Thank you very much for your time today! Please ask the two of you for more details, as you are the ones who know the details. I am currently serving a customer, so if you will excuse me, Miss Selkie, Miss Merle, please take care of the rest."

<blank>

Smiling with dull eyes, the owner said to each of us, "I look forward to working with you," and immediately went back inside the store.

You had several small beads of sweat on your forehead. ...... I wonder if he is a very busy person.

<blank>

Let's go! As you may have heard, we have been here many times already, so we know our way around! Hehe, ah, here's the changing room! Here's the changing room!

<blank>

Merle-san took me by the hand and led me around to the back of the building and took me straight to the changing rooms through the back door.

<blank>

Then, please change into one of these uniforms! If it doesn't fit, just let me know and I'll bring it right back!"

What? Ki, change of clothes ......?"

Hi! Here's a change of clothes! When you are done, please wait outside the door. We'll get right to work!"

<blank>

Here, put this on. ...... and? This?

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Oh my! Not bad, huh?

Sue-chan! You're so cute! She's so cute!

'Mia is pretty awesome, though! Some of it is! I mean, ......! Are you really going to wear this to work, huh?

That's right. This is the store's uniform! It's pretty cute and I like it. ......, didn't you like it, Mr. Cloud? Isn't it cute?"

Oh! No, no! I think it's cute, don't you? I do, but ...... what in the world are you doing in such a flirty outfit?

"Oh, the job is easy, sir. Just go out on the street there and hand out flyers for an hour!"

<blank>

Bibi and the others in the uniforms provided seem pleased with the attire.

I, too, admit that this is cute. ......

<blank>

So, apparently, the job is simply to hand out flyers.

Well, it's my first job as an adventurer, so I guess it's such an easy one. ...... I knew it was different from what I expected.

If you're an adventurer, you can collect medicinal herbs, or take down small fry MOBs ...... or rabbits or something like that ......? That's what I thought.

That's just handing out flyers or .......

I wonder if this is also something like an errand quest in the city or a mobile quest. ......

<blank>

It's all right! It seems that the owner likes you all, and I'm sure you'll get nominated! You'll be up in the ranks in no time!

<blank>

I thought the owner of this store was a serious person when I greeted him earlier, but...! But when he told me that this was a uniform, I wondered if I could trust him. I can't help but think again after all this time!

Because this is cosplay! It's a cosplay that's totally in your wheelhouse, isn't it?

<blank>

We are wearing black maid's uniforms, white aprons, and white prims on our heads.

Yes, it is unmistakably a maid set!

Moreover! It's a gothic lolita maid outfit, Kore!

<blank>

The maid uniform is a corset skirt like the school uniform, but the skirt is very short!

And it has a great flare and even has a large ruffle at the hem.

Her blouse is short-sleeved, so her arms are showing, but only cuffs are attached to her wrists. And there's even a choker around her neck.

I don't care, but don't these cuffs look like the ones worn by bunnies and such? What the heck are their attributes?

<blank>

The tea house has great tea, of course, but the chiffon cakes are also exquisite! And the uniforms of the waitresses are very cute and popular with the girls!

<blank>

Hmmm...could this be a maid café type thing?

That's the outfit that makes sense in a manner of speaking, though it's ......!

But! I feel that the overall finish is slightly erotic! Is it my imagination?

<blank>

In general, this skirt is too fluttery, isn't it? It's too short! It's too short!

What is this? Can't you see it if I bend over? You can see it, right? For sure!

If this skirt is this light, I feel like I'll be in big trouble if I move badly!

I don't know why everyone else is moving around with impunity?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

My anxiety was not taken into account, as everyone else got dressed and quickly set up their work arrangements.

The flyers will be distributed in three locations, so they will be divided into three groups of two people each.

Me and Merle. Karen and Selkie. And Bibi and Mia.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or not, but I'm sure it's a good idea. They were breathing a sigh of relief ....... Are they going to be okay?

<blank>

<blank>

We will be at the corner of the street to the east, you and Kuroki will be at the corner of the street to the west, and Merle and Cloud will be in front of the store.

I'm going to go out there and see what happens! Then let's go out there and see what happens!"

I'll do my best! I'll do my best!

Good luck, Sue!"

<blank>

Mr. Selkie directed us to where each of us was headed.

Are Bibi and Mia getting into something?

Even Karen seems to be getting into the swing of things.

<blank>

So everyone took their quota of flyers and went to their assigned locations.

<blank>

Then, Mr. Cloud, we'll come with you! "Well, then, Mr. Cloud, we'll be on our way too! Let's go give them away!

"You're all tense, aren't you ...... haha. But still, are you all okay moving that hard?"

Yes? Is there something wrong?"

"Because with such a short, light, flared skirt, ...... it could easily ...... roll up, couldn't it?"

"Oh, like this? Sole!"

What are you doing? What are you doing? It's open! It's rolled up, it's rolled up! I can see it! I can see it!

What? What?"

So, so ...... and underwear? Is ...... the ......? Huh?"

Haha! It's all right, sir? Master Cloud!"

But..." Did you see it? It's ......?"

"Oh, hola, this is a petticoat you can see, okay?"

Huh?

And, you know, this one is fluffy and kind of cute, right?"

<blank>

Oh, no. Are you wearing panniers too?

Huh? What? Well, I did think that everyone's skirts were voluminous, but ......? What?

Why? Why now? Why didn't I notice it before? Why? What? What?

<blank>

"Hmm? Can I help you?"

"Oh, I got this ...... and I don't have ......, but..."

What? Why? Wasn't it with the uniforms?

"No, it was ......, it was only ......."

Yeah, yeah, yeah! No way! Oh, really, I'm not wearing any."

I'm so sorry, I can't believe you! Please don't roll me up!

"Well, just in case you're wondering, ......, what are your interests in that kind of ......?"

I don't have one!

"Then ...... hmmm, I'm in trouble ...... this means that just a little movement on the boulevard will expose that incendiary thing and expose it to a lot of people!"

"Oh, you know,...... if you could choose your words a little more carefully,...... I think...?"

<blank>

<blank>

I can't help it! If this situation continues, many people will question the chastity of Master Cloud! Let's hurry back to the locker room and try to resolve the situation!"

Oh, I think I have a normal sense of chastity, ......, but? Thank you for ............, ...... Oh, please."

<blank>

We were about to hand out flyers on the main street in front of the store, but we had to return to the store with Merle because of an emergency situation.

We entered an alley next to a store facing the main street, and a short walk back leads us to the back door of the store we came out of ......, which has a door leading to the locker room.

There should be a set of petticoats and panniers in the changing room, so let's hurry up and find and equip them and get back to the street immediately," Merle said as he pushed me back into the alley! Merle pushed me back into the alley.

<blank>

Yes! Then, as soon as possible, ......n? Huh? Did you get stuck on something?"

"Hyah! My skirt? Meruru-san's sleeve? Wait, don't lift it up! Don't lift it up! Don't raise your hands!

Huh?" Did the cuffs get caught on the ruffles? Well, it will come off if you do this! Hoi!

What? Huh? Wait a minute! Wait a minute, Mr. Merle! Chooo...... hiyaaaa!"

<blank>

Somehow, the cufflinks on Merle's wrists seemed to have caught on the ruffles of my skirt.

Merle-san waved his hand and tried to get me off the hook, but that only made my skirt flap and roll up!

<blank>

What? It doesn't come off? Like this? Yes! This way? That way!

Wait, wait, wait, wait, Merle! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

Oh," he said! Huh? Uh, like this? Huh, huh? Huh? Yah! To! Huh?

I'm not going to let you do that! That's why! No, no, no, no! Aaah! No!

What? Why not? Please wait a moment, we'll get it right away! Yup! Hm! That! Huh?

<blank>

It's in an alley, so there's no one to see, which is still good, no, not good, but..! What are you doing, Mr. Merle!

Why does this guy think he can just wave his hand around and it will come off?

So! I told you not to move! Because my skirt is being pulled up! It's being raised!

<blank>

I can see it, I can see it, I can see it!"

I'll be right over! I'll be done in a minute! Hoy!

'Please listen to me, please listen to me, ahhhhhhh! AHHHHHHHH!!!"

<blank>

Don't move your arms so hard! Don't swing it up! ！！！！

Even though I was holding the hem of her skirt, the part that was tangled in Merle's sleeves was being pulled up and rolled up!

My behind! My butt is the butt!!!!!!!

I can see it, I can see it! It's rolled up, it's rolled up! I can see it, I can see it, I can see it, I can see it, I can see it!

<blank>

I'm going to go to the beach and see what's going on! Suzy! It's you two over here.

Npyaaah!!!!"

Oh! Mr. Haggard! Mr. Davis!

<blank>

Why did you come here? Why did you come here? Both of you!

You two were supposed to be caught in Bibi and Mia's bed earlier, weren't you?

Why did you come to Koch at this time?

<blank>

Earlier, I had sensed the presence of two people coming down the main street toward us.

But I stopped around where Bibi and Mia were handing out flyers, so I knew they must be meeting and greeting the two of them .......

And yet! Why are you coming into this alley now?

What in the world is going on here that he shows up just as I'm panicking?

<blank>

Why are you pulling into this alley?"

No, sir! It's just a little trouble! But don't worry! It will be taken care of soon! Yo! Ho!

N'baaaah! It's! So stop it and ...... nbaaaaah!!!"

<blank>

Merle continues to put my skirt in jeopardy, regardless of the fact that there are two bastards in front of me.

I'm crying, Merle! I'm going to cry now!

<blank>

We were unloading at a construction site and were walking down this street to the site when we saw Bibi and his friends. We were walking down this street on our way to the site when we saw Bibi and his friends. We asked about them, and they said Suzy and her friends were along the street, so we came to check on them. Then I casually looked down this alley and was surprised to see Suzy and the others.

<blank>

Irving was happy to tell me how he arrived at this place, even though I didn't ask him. Lombardo was sent to a different site, so Irving and Mr. Davis were working alone.

<blank>

Hm?" Is something wrong, Miss Cloud? You don't seem to have the best expression on your face.

What? Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing...?

"Hmm? What's up Suzy? Is there a problem?"

I'm fine, and so is Irving! You don't have to come! I'm fine! Don't come here!

No. I'm not going to overlook it if you're in trouble! If you're in trouble, we can't just overlook you."

He said, "Danny's right, Suzy. Let me know if you need anything."

<blank>

Mr. Davis, Irving noticed my condition while we were talking and asked me how I was feeling, looking concerned.

Irving, too, steps forward, still looking worried. I told you not to come here!

I mean! What's a Danny? Who's Danny? When did these two get to call each other by nickname?

<blank>

Oh, and now I know, now I know, I know!

The identity of this uneasy and fearless premonition that has been there all along is .......

<blank>

Mr. Davis, ......, I knew it was you, you guys, ....... The encounter between the two of you is the source of all this.

<blank>

No, Mr. Davis, I am well aware that you are not a bad person.

He is a good man, not a bad man, but a good man. The more I get to know him, the more I realize that he is a trustworthy man.

<blank>

But it's ......, though!

He is 'dangerous'!

It is definitely not a good idea to get to know each other more than you do now and get even closer to each other!

<blank>

Because!

<blank>

I have seen it! I have noticed!

<blank>

<blank>

It was after the entrance ceremony, after our eyes met and we both gave a brief nod to each other.

A female student walking behind him suddenly tripped over his leg and almost fell.

Quickly, he reached out to support her, and what his outstretched hand grabbed was a secret bulge filled with a boy's dreams!

I felt some sympathy for him at that moment, because the next moment, with a dry sound, I saw a trace of autumn leaves on his cheek.

<blank>

But I couldn't figure out why my toes would catch on the floor and trip on a smooth floor with nothing on it!

<blank>

<blank>

And, I think that was the day they carved the spiritual seal.

After the new students had completed their magic invocation training, they were all heading to their classrooms for lunch.

He was walking around chatting and laughing with his classmates when I saw him.

It was just as he was approaching the stairs. A female student was trying to go downstairs from the top of the stairs as well.

She placed her hand on the stair railing, took a step forward with her leg, and somehow slipped off the railing and lost her balance significantly.

After that, the girl's body was beautifully, picture-perfectly, suspended in mid-air, about to tumble down the stairs.

But then our Mr. Davis took a stand, jumped on the girl, held her in his arms, and rolled to the bottom of the stairs while protecting her.

It was truly a heroic act. In fact, she didn't even have a scratch on her!

<blank>

But what does that mean?

Why was he rolling around on the floor with his head tucked into that skirt of the girl who was sitting at the bottom of the stairs?

I can still see her red-faced and twitching.

<blank>

<blank>

And that was the day before yesterday.

<blank>

I try to visit the rose garden whenever I find time.

This is, of course, to help restore the plantings that were ruined at the time, even if only a little.

The gardener said with a smile, "You don't have to come all the way out here to do that," but it's not that simple, is it?

Some of the plants have gone so far down that they have to be dug up and replanted from the roots up.

And I felt so bad when I saw that it had been dug up and the planting was pockmarked just there. ......

<blank>

When I went to the rose garden that day, I saw a mess of roots and branches that had just been pulled out and cut down, so I offered to help clean up the mess.

The gardener "Oniisan" tried to refuse my offer, saying, "I can't let a schoolgirl do that! No! Let me do it!　No, no, no! I can't let you do that! And so the question and answer was about to start here, too.

And just then, Mr. Davis came along.

<blank>

He, like me, felt responsible for the devastation of the rose garden, and when he had time, he would come to "Oniisan" to ask if there was anything he could do. Whenever he had time, he would come to "Oniisan" to ask if there was anything he could do.

Davis-kun saw the exchange between me and "Oniisan," and decided that he would do it himself! He stepped forward to clean up the mess of plant branches and other debris.

At that moment, he seemed to have stepped on a fallen branch.

I don't know if it was by accident or if it meant something, but anyway, he stepped on a branch that had fallen there!

The branch was unexpectedly long, and its fulcrum was very close to his feet.

The ends of the long branches use their fulcrums to lift upward, like leverage, with a seesaw-like momentum.

And why not? Somehow! The tip of that branch was right at my feet!

<blank>

It was just a moment. It was just a moment.

My skirt did indeed bounce up. It did bounce up!

But I didn't see through it, and the next moment I had it under control!

Kick! When I turned my eyes toward him, he had already bent his body from the waist and lowered his head so low that his head might touch the ground. His head was so lowered that I thought his head might touch the ground.

And then he said, "I am sorry! It was not on purpose! I never saw it!

He apologized out loud and came to me.

Well, I can't get mad at you if you keep your head so low. ...... "Please raise your head. This was an accident, and I'm going to put it behind me. And if you can't see it, it can't be helped. I decided to forgive him at that time because of what had happened before.

I have decided to forgive them, though!

But what did I mean by the fact that his ears were so red that he never lifted his head?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In a short period of less than a week, I have witnessed and experienced this many incidents one after another.

I have to admit that I have one suspicion.

<blank>

He said ...... Daniel Davis, you may have a lucky streak? And!

So ever since I had that suspicion about him, I have tried to keep my distance from him as much as possible.

<blank>

I thought so, but what is this?

Above all, now that he and Irving, who have similar characteristics, are together! I can only foresee a radically disturbing future?

<blank>

Thinking back, it was the day I entered the dormitory. The day I arrived at the school gate.

It is said that not only Irving was there, but also Mr. Davis. ......

Is this really a coincidence?

<blank>

Yes, there is no such thing as coincidence in this world.

All that there is is inevitable.

<blank>

Could it be that the tragedy had been caused by their presence in the same place? The suspicion that this was the cause of the tragedy was now swirling furiously in my mind.

The closer they get to me, the more disgusting sweat is pouring down my back.

<blank>

By any chance, no! Even if not by any chance! This current situation was caused by the two of them being together, wasn't it?

If so, please contact .......

If so, then ......!

<blank>

I'm fine, you two! You don't have to come here!

<blank>

No, Suzy? You really don't look good. You don't look okay."

MissCloud! I want you to tell me anything you can do to help! Can't you at least let me help you a little?!"

<blank>

They then came closer and closer toward us!

<blank>

That's the kind of place! That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about, you two!

I know you are the kind of people who can't help but reach out to a girl in need! I know that, though!

Please, if they tell you not to come, I want you to stay away! Really! Please! Right?

<blank>

There are times when a girl wants the gentlemen to refrain! In those situations, you often say, "It's okay," and ask them to decline, don't you? Isn't that right?

You guys have been through this before! Hey? Haven't you learned? Right? Really...!

Now I am crying (in my inner world!) I am crying (in the inner world!) and asking for your refusal at all costs!

I'm getting it! And these people don't understand that at all! Why?

<blank>

What? Is that strange? Where is it stuck? This one? This one? This one?

Oh, oh, Mr. Merle? At this juncture ......, what are you doing?"

<blank>

While I was fighting in fear, Merle, who never learns, began to make some suspicious moves!

Wait! Don't make a move, you too!

It is definitely your actions that are leading the current situation in the wrong direction, okay?

Please don't do anything! Please!

<blank>

I think that this string is tied up! So I'm going to ...... this way!"

What did you just do? What did you just...? What did you pull aaaaaaahhh?!!!!"

<blank>

I felt my blood run cold all at once.

The thing that Mr. Merle pulled at, saying "string", is none other than my equipment for today.

Today was not a particularly special day, so I was wearing something quite ordinary.

You can find your favorite things that are perfectly normal at .......

I liked the smooth satin and the baby blue fabric.

And the strings tied at the sides of the waist are also very pretty, like blue ribbons!

Yes, today I was equipped with those favorite "string pants"!

<blank>

The cufflinks on the sleeves that Merle is hooked to are now entangled not only in the frills of my skirt, but also in the strings on my left side!

How do I know? Because every time Merle's arm moves, I can feel the string slipping and loosening!

Merle-san is about to disarm one of the maiden's most important defense mechanisms! It is about to be completely disarmed!

<blank>

'No, so no! Don't move!

Yeah!" Here! How about that!!!!"

How's it going? I'm not!!! ！！！！！"

<blank>

Even though I was holding back my skirt, Merle-san raised his right hand, which was entangled in my skirt, with all his might!

As a result, the back of the skirt was rolled up to its fullest!

In addition, even the knot on the left side of the string was completely unraveled!

<blank>

Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin!"

<blank>

It is not surprising that I immediately raised my voice in a way that is unbecoming of a lady.

Because! If they bare their asses, they will make this kind of noise, won't they?

I immediately put my hands behind my back and restrained my skirt, but Irving and Mr. Davis, who was right in front of me, were frozen in that instant.

I guess the stones must have understood what was happening to me.

<blank>

However, a phenomenon occurred at this point that could be described as a follow-up to the previous one.

The wind came from somewhere in this alleyway!

Did the wind, by flowing from the main street into the back alley, gain momentum and become a gust of wind?

It passed them from behind Mr. Irving and Mr. Davis, and when it reached me, it blew up as if rising from its feet and lifted the front of my skirt, which was momentarily unprotected!

At the same time, the completely unraveled cord fell off!

The thin fabric of the front part, which has only a small area, completely abandoned its given mission at that moment!

<blank>

Of course! Quickly, he put his hands in front of him, which were holding his back, and restrained his skirt, which stood up unprotected!

<blank>

Then, I turned my sharp gaze toward the two insolents standing in front of me, and with a snap, I turned my gaze to condemn them.

At that moment, both of them quickly turned their faces away from each other at the same time to show that they were not looking at each other!

<blank>

I didn't see it! I didn't see it, Susie! I didn't see anything!

"Oh, um, Mr. ...... Cloud? Um, that ......"

"ude...... u, u......"

<blank>

The way Irving's excuses are becoming exactly like Ryder's is irresistibly irritating!

In general, I don't find it at all convincing that they didn't see it, with both of their averted faces turning bright red!

<blank>

Merle-san seemed to have finally realized what he had done, and quietly put his hand down.

After being cornered to this point, this is the kind of punishment?

Don't you think this is too ...... much?

Is this the ...... expression of the ...... double lucky scheme, or ......?

<blank>

I am a human being after all, no matter how many cheats I have, I am so powerless in front of a lucky scheme?

It was as if I was confronted with this fact, and tears began to well up in my eyes, as I felt ashamed, frustrated, and embarrassed.

<blank>

"............ or ......?"

"......!!!!

<blank>

Davis's stabbing mutter sent a violent shock through my brain stem and into my heart, as if someone had driven a huge stake through my heart, and I staggered unsteadily to my feet.

My body is shaking with a pull. I think all the blood flow in my body is concentrated in my face. My face is so hot!

......Did you, Mr. Davis,......Davis? ......What in the world have you seen ...... of me ......?

<blank>

 --!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

A tremor from my soul gushed endlessly from the back of my throat!

And while I was screaming, a small area of thin cloth, which was supposed to be the absolute last line of defense, slipped down my legs and fell right at my feet!



<blank>

----------------

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

I spent three episodes just to write a lucky sketch...

But! I don't regret it at all!
