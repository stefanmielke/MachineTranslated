# Episode 96: Weekend Apocalypse

It's a grand subtitle, but it's a very personal perspective (`・ω・´)

----------------

<b>

"Um, th-this is... the, w-workplace... right?"

"Wow, it's more impressive than I thought!"

<b>

We arrived in front of a cute building with beautiful white walls.

As Bibi said, the building's four corners were made of bricks, and the windows and doors had a solid, heavy feel to them.

<b>

"Yes, this way please. Ah, owner, thank you for your assistance today as well."

"Ah, Selkie and Meruru! Thank you for today as well! Oh? And these young ladies, what are your plans for today?"

"Yes, this is our first job today. Please take good care of us."

"Oh, no, no! Thank you for your help! As expected from the academy students. You all are quite the catch! Really, I'm truly grateful!"

<b>

As I was absentmindedly looking up at the building we had arrived at, a person came out from it... probably our employer this time, who Selkie called the owner, greeted us and introduced us.

That person was a gentleman with a plump build and a gentle aura, looking very kind. He seemed to be in his late 30s to 40s.

<b>

"Thank you for today! You two know the details, so please ask them. I'm currently busy with customers, so I'll excuse myself for now, but Selkie, Meruru, please take care of the rest."

<b>

With twinkling eyes and a smile, he greeted each of us with "Please take care of us," before promptly returning inside the shop.

There were several beads of sweat on his forehead... I wonder if he is quite busy.

<b>

"Well then, let's go! As you heard, we've been here many times, so we know the drill! Hehe, oh! The changing room is this way!"

<b>

Meruru grabbed my hand and led me around to the back of the building, taking me straight to the changing room through the back entrance.

<b>

"Now, please change into this uniform! If it doesn't fit, just let me know and I'll bring you a different size right away!"

"Huh? C-change...?"

"Yes! Change! Once you're done, please wait outside that door. We'll start working right away!"

<b>

W-wait, you want me to wear this...? This?

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

"Oh wow! Not bad, huh?!"

"Sue-chan! You're cute! Super cute!!!"

"Mia, you're looking quite impressive too! At least one part of you!! ...Wait, are we really going to work in this?!"

"Of course! This is the uniform for this shop! It's quite cute, and I like it... but, Cloud-sama, didn't you like it? Isn't it cute?"

"Oh! No! I think it's cute?! I do, but... what exactly are we supposed to do in this frilly outfit?!"

"Oh, the job is simple! Just go out to the street and hand out flyers for an hour!"

<b>

Bibi and the others, dressed in the prepared uniforms, seemed satisfied with their outfits.

I admit that this is cute, but...

<b>

So, it seems the job is just handing out flyers.

Well, since this is my first job as an adventurer, I guess it makes sense that it's something simple... but still, it's different from what I expected.

As an adventurer, I thought it would be something like gathering medicinal herbs or defeating weak mobs... like horned rabbits... or something like that.

But it's just handing out flyers...

Is this like a delivery quest or a quest to move around in the city...?

<b>

"Don't worry! It seems the owner likes you all, so you'll definitely get picked! Your rank will go up in no time!!"

<b>

The owner of this shop seemed like a decent person when we greeted him earlier, but saying this is a uniform makes me wonder if I can trust him? I can't help but think that now!!

Because this is a cosplay! It's clearly a cosplay that reflects personal taste!!

<b>

What we are wearing is a black maid outfit with a white apron, and on our heads, a white prim.

Yes, there's no mistaking it, it's a maid set!

Moreover! This is a gothic-lolita maid outfit!!

<b>

The maid outfit has a corset skirt similar to a school uniform, but the skirt is very short!

And the flare is impressive, with large frills at the hem.

The blouse is short-sleeved, so my arms are exposed, but only cuffs are attached at the wrists. And there's even a choker around my neck.

By the way, doesn't this cuff look like something a bunny girl would wear? What kind of attribute is this?!!

<b>

"This tea house is known not only for its delicious tea but also for its exquisite chiffon cake! And the waitresses' uniforms are super cute, which is very popular among girls!!"

<b>

Hmm, could this be something like a maid café?

Thinking about it that way, it is a somewhat understandable outfit, but... still!!

But! Overall, I feel like it's a bit too erotic! Is it just my imagination?!

<b>

Isn't this skirt too fluttery? Isn't it too short?! If I bend over, won't it be visible?! It will be visible, right?! Absolutely!!!

With how light this skirt is, I feel like moving around carelessly will lead to a disaster!!

I don't understand how everyone can move around so casually!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

While I was worrying about that, everyone quickly changed and started organizing the work.

The flyer distribution would be done at three locations, so we would split into three pairs.

Me and Meruru. Karen and Selkie. And Bibi and Mia.

Since they paired beginners with experienced ones, Meruru and Selkie would accompany me and Karen, but... both Bibi and Mia are also first-timers, yet they were saying "Leave it to us!" with determination... are they going to be okay?

<b>

<b>

"Then, we'll be at the corner of the east street ahead, while the two of you will be at the corner of the west street, and Meruru and Cloud-sama will be in front of the shop, please."

"Alright! Let's go out there and give it our all!"

"Cloud-sama! I'll do my best!"

"Sue-chan, good luck!"

<b>

Selkie gave us directions on where to go.

Bibi and Mia seem to be quite motivated?

Even Karen seems to be getting into it.

<b>

So everyone took their share of flyers and headed to their assigned locations.

<b>

"Alright, Cloud-sama, let's go too! Come on! Let's distribute those flyers like crazy!"

"You all seem really fired up... sigh. But are you all really okay moving around so energetically?"

"Huh? Is there a problem?"

"Well, with such a short and light flared skirt... um, won't it easily... ride up?"

"Oh, like this? Like this!"

"W-what are you doing?! It's open! It's riding up! It's showing! It's definitely showing!!"

"Huh? What is?"

"I-I mean... my... underwear? ...Huh?"

"Ahaha! It's fine, Cloud-sama!"

"B-but! Was it visible? ...Right?"

"Oh, look, this is a petticoat, so it's fine if it shows, right?"

"Huh?"

"And look, this one is fluffy and a bit cute, right?"

<b>

Huh? Are they wearing petticoats too?

Huh? Huh? I thought everyone’s skirts had some volume, but... huh? Huh?!

Why? Why didn't I notice until now? Why? Huh? Huh?!

<b>

"Huh? What's wrong?"

"Um... I... I didn't get that...?"

"Huh?! Why not?! Wasn't it supposed to come with the uniform?!"

"It wasn't... just this... was all..."

"Huh?! No way!! Oh, you're right, you're not wearing it!"

"Meow! D-don't lift it up!!"

"Um, just to ask... do you have that kind of hobby...?"

"I don't!!!"

"So then... hmm, that's a problem... if this continues, your modesty will be questioned by many people! We need to hurry back to the changing room and resolve this situation!"

"Um, I... I do have a sense of modesty, you know? ...Thank you... um, please."

<b>

We were supposed to hand out flyers in front of the shop, but due to this emergency, I ended up going back to the shop with Meruru.

We entered the alley next to the shop facing the main street, and if we went back a bit, there was the back door to the shop we had come out from... leading directly to the changing room.

The changing room should have the set petticoats and all, so let's hurry and find them, equip them, and return to the street! Meruru urged me forward into the depths of the alley.

<b>

"Yes! Let's hurry... Huh? Huh? Did something get caught?"

"Yah! M-my skirt?!! On Meruru's sleeve?! Wait! Don't lift it! Don't raise your hand!!"

"Huh? Did the cuff get caught in the frill? Well, if I do this, it should come off! Whoosh!"

"Huh? Wha?! W-wait, Meruru! W-wait... ahh!!"

<b>

For some reason, it seemed that the cuff button on Meruru's wrist got caught in my skirt's frill.

Meruru was waving her hand to try to free it, but that only caused my skirt to flutter more and more!

<b>

"Huh? Can't get it off? Like this? Whoa! Is it this way? That way!"

"W-wait, wait, wait, Meruru! S-stop moving... wait!!!"

"Ah, ah! Huh? Like this? Huh? Huh? Whoa! Whoa?"

"St-stop! D-don't! D-don't!!!"

"Huh? Why? Just wait a moment, it will come off soon! Whoa! Huh?"

<b>

It's good that there are no people in the alley, but no, it's not good! What is Meruru doing?!

Why does she think that just waving her hand will free it?!

So! I told you to stop moving!! The skirt is being pulled! It's being lifted!!

<b>

"It's visible! It's visible! It's visible!!!"

"It's fine! It will be over soon! Whoa!!"

"Please, just listen to meeeeeeeeeee!!! Aahhh!!"

<b>

Stop moving your arms so wildly! Don't raise them!!!

Even though I'm holding down my skirt, the part tangled in Meruru's sleeve is being pulled up and fluttering!!

The back! My butt is!!!

It's visible! It's fluttering! It's definitely visible!!!

<b>

"Hey! Suzy! Is that you two over there?"

"Yahhh!!"

"Oh! Haggard-kun! Davis-kun!!"

<b>

Why?! Why did they come here?! Both of them!!!

Weren't they supposed to be with Bibi and Mia just a moment ago?!!

Why did they come here at this timing?!!

<b>

I sensed the presence of the two approaching down the main street earlier.

But since they stopped near where Bibi and Mia were handing out flyers, I thought they were just greeting them... so I understood that.

Yet, why are they entering this alley now?!

It's as if they are taking advantage of my panic to appear, what is going on?!!

<b>

"Why are you hiding in this alley?"

"No! Just a little trouble! But it's fine! It will be resolved soon!! Whoosh! Whoa!!"

"Yah?! W-what are you doing?! Nyaahhh!!"

<b>

Even with the two guys in front of me, Meruru continues to put my skirt in a critical situation.

Can't you notice it already, Meruru?! I'm about to cry!!!

<b>

"Our job was unloading at a construction site, but while walking down this street, we saw Bibi and the others. When we heard you two were along the street, we came to see, but you weren't here! So, when we casually peeked into this alley, we were surprised to find you two!"

<b>

Without even being asked, Arvin happily explained how they ended up here. Lombart was sent to a different site, so it seems Arvin and Davis-kun are acting together.

<b>

"Huh? What's wrong, Miscloud? You don't look so good."

"Huh?! N-no, it's nothing!!"

"Huh? What's wrong, Suzy? Is there a problem?"

"I-I'm fine, Arvin! You don't need to come! I'm fine! Don't come!"

"No! If you're in trouble, I can't just ignore it."

"Danny is right, Suzy. If there's something, just tell us."

<b>

As Arvin and Davis-kun were talking, they noticed my condition and looked worried.

Arvin also stepped forward with a worried expression. I told you not to come!!!

And what’s with this "Danny"? When did they become close enough to call each other by nicknames?!!

<b>

Ah, and I've realized, I've realized!

The identity of the anxiety and ominous premonition I've had all along...

<b>

Davis-kun... it’s definitely you, you two... Your encounter is the root cause of everything.

<b>

No, I know that Davis-kun is not a bad person.

Far from it, he is a very good man. The more I get to know him, the more I realize he is someone trustworthy.

<b>

But... but!

He is "dangerous"!

Getting to know him better and getting closer is absolutely risky!

<b>

Why? Because!!!

<b>

I have seen it! I have realized it!!

<b>

That was after the entrance ceremony when we exchanged glances and nodded lightly.

A female student walking behind him suddenly tripped and almost fell.

In a split second, he reached out to support her, but instead, he grabbed something filled with a boy's dreams!

The next moment, a dry sound echoed as a mark of autumn appeared on his cheek, and I felt a bit of sympathy at that time.

<b>

But I couldn't understand why, on a completely smooth floor, her toes would trip on the ground!!

<b>

And that was the day we carved the spirit seal.

After all the new students had finished their magic activation practice and were heading to the classroom for lunch, I saw him walking while chatting with classmates.

Just as he was approaching the stairs, a female student was trying to descend from above.

As she placed her hand on the handrail and stepped down, for some reason, she slipped her hand off the handrail and lost her balance.

After that, it was like a scene from a painting as the female student flew through the air and was about to tumble down the stairs.

But at that moment, our Davis-kun threw himself forward, caught the female student, and rolled down the stairs while protecting her.

I think that was a truly heroic act. In fact, she didn't even get a scratch!

<b>

But what does this mean?!

Why was he, at the bottom of the stairs, sticking his head under the skirt of the girl who was sitting down?!!

The image of her blushing and twitching is burned into my memory.

<b>

And that was the day before yesterday.

<b>

I have been trying to find time to visit that rose garden.

Of course, it's because I want to help restore the shrubbery that I ruined that time.

The gardener "big brother" said, "You don't have to come all the way for that," but I can't just leave it alone.

Some of the plants were completely broken at the roots, so the damaged parts need to be dug up and replanted.

Seeing the dug-up area with a gaping hole made me feel really sorry...

<b>

That day, when I went to the rose garden, there were roots and branches from the pruned plants scattered around, so I offered to help clean up.

The gardener "big brother" said, "I can't let a female student do that," and tried to refuse my offer, but I insisted, "No! Please let me do it!" and a debate started there as well.

And just then, Davis-kun arrived.

<b>

He also felt responsible for the state of the rose garden, just like me, and came to ask the "big brother" if there was anything he could do if he had time.

Seeing my exchange with the "big brother," Davis-kun stepped forward, saying he would help clean up the scattered branches.

At that moment, it seemed he stepped on a fallen branch.

Whether it was a coincidence or had some meaning, I don't know, but anyway, he stepped on the branch that was lying there!

That branch was unexpectedly long, with the pivot point very close to his foot.

The long end of the branch used that pivot to rise up with force, like a seesaw.

And for some reason! For some reason!! The tip of that branch was right at my feet!!!

<b>

It was a moment. Just a moment.

My skirt definitely flew up. It flew up!!

But I quickly suppressed it the next moment!!!

When I glared at him, he was already bending down so low that his head was almost touching the ground.

And he shouted, "I'm so sorry! It wasn't on purpose!! I definitely didn't see anything!!!"

Well, with him bowing so low, I couldn't get angry... so I said, "Please raise your head. This was an accident, so let's leave it at that, and you forget about it!" If he didn't see it, then it can't be helped. For now, considering the previous incident, I decided to forgive him.

I decided to forgive him, but!

But the fact that he kept his head down for so long and his ears were quite red, what does that mean?!

<b>

<b>

<b>

In this short span of less than a week, I have witnessed and experienced so many incidents.

At this point, I can't help but have one suspicion.

<b>

He... Daniel Davis-kun, could it be that he has a "lucky pervert" constitution?!

That's why, ever since I had that suspicion, I wanted to keep my distance from him as much as possible.

<b>

I thought that, but what is this?!

More than anything, now that both he and Arvin, who share similar traits, are together! I can only foresee the arrival of an extremely unsettling future!!!

<b>

Thinking back to the day I entered the dormitory. When I arrived at the school gate.

Both Arvin and Davis-kun were there...

Is this really just a coincidence?

<b>

That's right, there are no coincidences in this world.

Everything is a necessity.

<b>

Could it be that the cause of that tragedy was because these two were in the same place? That suspicion is now swirling violently in my mind.

The closer they get, the more unpleasant sweat trickles down my back.

<b>

Could it be, no! It definitely is! This current situation was caused by the presence of these two together!!!

If that's the case...

If that's the case...!!

<b>

"I-I'm fine, you two! Y-you don't need to come!!"

<b>

"No, Suzy? Your face doesn't look good at all! That's definitely not okay!"

"Miscloud! If there's anything I can do, please tell me! At least let me help a little!!"

<b>

Saying that, the two of them started to approach us!

<b>

That's exactly it! That's exactly it! That's exactly it, you two!!!

You both are the type who can't ignore a girl in trouble! I know that! I know it, but!!

Please, when I say not to come, don't come closer! Really! Please don't!! Okay?!

<b>

There are moments when a girl wants the gentlemen to hold back! In those times, saying "I'm fine" and declining is quite common, right? It should be common!!

You both must have experienced that countless times until now!! Right?! Haven't you learned anything?! Hey?!

Right now, I am crying (internally!) and desperately asking you to stay away!

Even though I'm asking for it! They completely don't understand that! Why?!!!

<b>

"Huh? That's strange? What's caught? This? That? Over here?"

"Ah, um, Meruru? At this point... w-what are you doing?"

<b>

While I was trembling in fear, one person, Meruru, who still hasn't learned, started making suspicious movements!

Wait! Don't move carelessly!

It's definitely your actions that are leading this situation in a bad direction!

Please, just do nothing! Please!!

<b>

"I think... this string is tangled! So I'm going to pull it like this... like this!"

"Meow?! W-what are you pulling?!"

<b>

I felt the blood drain from my face in an instant.

What Meruru referred to as a "string" was none other than my equipment for today.

Since today is not a special day, I was wearing something quite ordinary.

Something quite ordinary that I particularly liked...

The smooth satin felt good against my skin, and I liked the baby blue fabric.

And the ribbons tied at my waist were very cute!

Yes, today I was equipped with my favorite "string panties"!!

<b>

The cuff button that Meruru was caught on was now tangled not only in the frill of my skirt but also in the string on my left side!

How do I know? Because every time Meruru's arm moves, I can feel the string sliding and loosening!!

Meruru is now about to completely deactivate one of the most important defensive mechanisms of a maiden!!!

<b>

"S-so, please! Don't move!!!"

"Yah! How about this?!"

"That's not what I meant!!!"

<b>

Even while holding down my skirt, Meruru raised her hand that was tangled in my skirt!

As a result, the back of my skirt flew up completely!

On top of that, the knot on the left side completely came undone!!

<b>

"Yahhhhhh!!!"

<b>

It's not surprising that I let out a voice unbefitting of a lady.

Because! If my butt is exposed, of course, I would scream like that, right?!

I immediately reached back to hold down my skirt, but Arvin and Davis-kun, who had come right in front of me, were frozen in shock for that brief moment.

They must have understood what was happening to me.

<b>

But here, a phenomenon that could be called a follow-up occurs.

A gust of wind blew into this alley from somewhere!

That wind, flowing from the main street into the back alley, must have gained momentum and turned into a strong gust!

It rushed past Arvin and Davis-kun from behind and reached me, blowing up from my feet and lifting the front of my skirt, which had been completely defenseless!

At the same time, the completely undone string fell away!

The thin fabric of the front, with only a small area, completely abandoned its mission at that moment!!

<b>

Of course! I quickly moved my hands from the back to hold down the now defenseless skirt!

<b>

And I shot a sharp glare at the two lecherous guys standing right in front of me, ready to condemn them.

In that moment, they both quickly turned their faces to the sides, as if to say, "I didn't see anything," but I know they were just staring wide-eyed a moment ago, you bastards!!

<b>

"I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything, Suzy! I didn't see anything!!"

"Um... Cloud-sama? Um, um..."

"Ugh... u, u..."

<b>

Arvin's way of making excuses was starting to resemble Rider, which was incredibly irritating!

Besides, the fact that both of their turned faces were bright red gives no credibility to their "I didn't see anything" claim!!

<b>

Meruru, too, seemed to finally realize what she had done and quietly lowered her hand.

After being pushed to this point, is this how it ends?!

Isn't this just too... too much?!

Is this... the manifestation of... double lucky pervert...?

<b>

Even if I have cheat abilities, I'm still just human; am I really this powerless against a lucky pervert?!!

It feels like I've been confronted with that fact, and I feel a mix of shame, regret, and embarrassment, causing tears to well up.

<b>

"...... red... huh?"

"......!!!"

<b>

With Davis-kun's whisper that felt like a finishing blow, I felt a shock as if a thick stake had been driven from my brainstem to my heart, causing me to stagger.

My body was trembling. My whole face felt like it was burning with blood rushing to it!!
