# Episode 200: Camp Defense Line

"These guys! They're still moving!"

<b>

At Beatrice's voice, everyone turns their eyes to the magical beasts they thought they had defeated.

Creatures flail their limbs, trying to escape while being pierced by the root spear.

Others, with their bodies bisected, thrash about in a state of having lost half of themselves.

What should have been dead is still moving as if it were normal.

<b>

"There's no doubt! It's a 'Linear Magical Lifeform'!"

<b>

Upon closer inspection, several long, thread-like entities can be seen writhing from the wounds of the magical beasts.

These entities extend from the bisected wounds of the beasts, writhing grotesquely.

<b>

"I guess just cutting them isn't enough."

<b>

"If that's the case..."

<b>

Mia places both hands on the ground once more and closes her eyes for a moment.

<b>

"Explode! 'Mana Burst'!"

<b>

Mia's magical power is channeled through the root spear into the ground.

In the next moment, the magical beasts that were pierced by the spear explode one after another.

<b>

"We handled them all at once, didn't we?! Do you have enough magical power?!"

<b>

Before the outdoor class departure, the members of Amukam had received lectures from both Dr. Nosori and Dr. Seiwashi on how to deal with 'Linear Magical Lifeforms'.

In other words, it was said that "if you directly inject magical power or holy energy into the magical beast's body, it will work."

<b>

What Mia just did was the 'Mana Burst', causing a magical explosion within the bodies of several magical beasts at once.

Normally, this would consume a fair amount of magical power.

Beatrice asks Mia if there’s any issue with her magical power management.

<b>

"Um, well, I'm just applying pressure to the magical power that's already pooled in the roots, so I'm not using much of my own magical power."

"…That's good!"

<b>

Beatrice decided to stop discussing it further, saying, "If that's the case, there's no problem."

However, Arvin and Lombart exchanged glances involuntarily. "It's easy to say you're using the pooled magical power, but normal humans can barely handle their own magical power, let alone do something like that," they thought, their faces tense.

They shift their gaze to Beatrice for agreement, but she merely shrugs. "Well, Mia is quite extraordinary anyway..." Arvin decided to stop thinking about Mia, who handles magic purely by instinct.

<b>

<b>

At that moment, a high-pitched scream echoed. It came from a magical beast that had lost its upper body.

It slammed its arms against the ground and lunged at Arvin.

Its arm strength was surprisingly strong. It made a loud noise as it hit the ground and charged straight at him, baring its fangs.

<b>

In response to the approaching creature, Arvin exhaled softly and thrust his two-handed sword forward with a slight movement.

The sword tip, enveloped in holy energy, pierced the magical beast without any resistance, easily penetrating its body.

At the same time, the magical beast's body suddenly swelled from the inside.

Immediately after, the beast's body rapidly deflated like a balloon losing air, losing its strength and sliding off the blade of the two-handed sword.

As it fell to the ground, the white, thread-like entities that had been visible from the beast's wound were no longer there.

<b>

"Yeah, this should be enough."

<b>

Lombart swung down his battle axe at the writhing body of the magical beast on the ground.

No writhing entities could be seen among the pieces of the beast that had exploded from the impact.

<b>

"If we crush them this finely, they won't exist anymore, right?"

<b>

Lombart responded with a small "Hmm" to Arvin's words as he shrugged while looking at the pieces.

<b>

First, they confirmed that they could deal with the 'Linear Magical Lifeform' using the methods taught by the doctors.

At the same time, this also indicated that someone behind this was involved. Arvin's mouth twisted into a wicked grin.

<b>

"Next! Here they come!"

<b>

Almost simultaneously with Beatrice's shout, small magical beasts flew in from between the trees.

They were creatures called 'Stargirats', resembling flying squirrels. Multiple ones glided down from the trees.

However, branches shot up one after another, piercing their bodies.

It was Mia's 'Branch Spear'.

The branch spears pierced the prey in mid-air one after another. The pierced prey exploded on the spot and fell to the ground without strength.

<b>

Those that escaped the spears were knocked down by Arvin's two-handed sword.

When the blade, wrapped in holy energy, pierced their bodies, the small magical beasts exploded on the spot.

<b>

Lombart swatted away the incoming small magical beasts with his battle axe.

The magical beasts struck by the heavy battle axe exploded on the spot.

<b>

"Against small ones like this, there's no problem at all."

"Even medium ones are the same."

"But we have to be careful with the larger ones. The teachers said that if they're bigger than a human, the 'Linear Magical Lifeform' converges inside them."

<b>

The three of them processed the incoming magical beasts one after another while confirming their handling of 'magical power' and 'ki'.

Small ones are not a problem. However, Mia cautioned that larger ones are not so easy to deal with.

<b>

"What was it again? Because they gather deep inside their bodies, we have to hit them directly with magical power or ki, right?"

"That's right. They said that many 'Linear Magical Lifeforms' gather like a nerve plexus, and a central part is generated there. No matter how much you attack the limbs or extremities, you can't stop the body's regeneration, so you have to do something about that central part."

"Then we have to actually try it!"

<b>

Arvin swung his two-handed sword at the last flying Stargirat, turning it into a spray of blood.

<b>

In this short time, the number of Stargirats defeated exceeded 30.

Even in Amukam, it's rare for this many to appear at once.

<b>

"We can try as many times as we want from now on! Come on! Next!"

<b>

Beatrice cast 'Vital Up' on the frontliners, Lombart and Arvin.

The stamina of the two was enhanced.

<b>

Lombart held the battle axe in a reverse grip with his right hand, horizontally positioning it and thrusting it forward.

<b>

A beast that had dashed through the trees bared its fangs at the thick handle of the battle axe.

'Terradog'

A magical beast resembling a mountain dog, about 1.5 meters long, that hunts in packs.

Lombart spun the battle axe as if it were a baton, easily knocking it away.

He then slammed the centrifugal force-laden axe into the side of another Terradog that had jumped in.

<b>

As one Terradog was sent flying by the axe, another lunged at Lombart.

However, Arvin cleaved it in half with an upward slash from his two-handed sword. At the same time, the bisected wound exploded with Arvin's holy energy.

<b>

From the explosion of the Terradog, two black-furred 'Dark Foxes' leaped at Arvin.

But they were pierced from below by the root that had transformed into a spear.

As they were pierced, they exploded.

<b>

Lombart cut down the magical beasts gathered by Arvin, while Mia's magic pierced through. However, the number of approaching magical beasts continued to increase over time.

<b>

"Don't let your guard down! If you do, they'll break through easily!"

"I know that!!"

<b>

In the middle of the magical beasts he had gathered, Lombart slammed his battle axe down toward the ground.

<b>

'Rock Cracker'

The rock beneath Lombart's feet exploded like a bomb.

Along with the rock, many magical beasts that had gathered around Lombart were blown away.

Furthermore, branches and roots transformed into spears, piercing through those magical beasts.

<b>

"I almost want to use 'Small Flame Barrage' and just wipe them all out!"

<b>

Despite having already dealt with a considerable number of magical beasts, Mia complained in frustration at the seemingly endless wave of approaching beasts.

<b>

"Don't you dare use that! Unlike the Amukam forest, the trees here have no magical resistance! If you use even a moderately powerful fire attribute magic, it will turn into a wildfire in no time, and we'll all be engulfed in flames!!"

<b>

"Ahhhh, yeah, I know, Bibi. I was just saying it."

<b>

Mia made a face of embarrassment, scratching her cheek with her fingertip while averting her gaze.

She then muttered, "Well, I'll try various things," and placed her hands back on the ground, creating several spears.

<b>

<b>

A drum-like vibration resonated from the ground.

Beatrice and the others quickly realized it was the vibration of something heavy running.

<b>

'Grayfang Boar'

A magical beast resembling a boar, about 1.5 meters long.

It has a tough hide like stone and four large tusks protruding from its snout.

Its charge can break through stone walls like paper, making it an opponent that even five ordinary guards cannot hope to restrain.

<b>

Now, one of them was charging in with tremendous force.

But Lombart stood firm in front of it without flinching, holding the battle axe horizontally with both hands, quietly lowering his stance.

<b>

Immediately after, Lombart and the magical beast collided violently.

The shockwave from their clash resonated in the lower abdomen and spread around.

Lombart's feet scraped against the ground, slightly sliding back.

The boar was knocked back, tumbling through the air.

Its snout was crushed and bent, and its large tusks shattered, scattering around.

<b>

Mia raised her gloved hand, channeling magical energy that glowed blue.

'Water Strike'

The water mass created by Mia accelerated toward its target, forming a column of water about 20 centimeters in diameter and 1 meter long.

<b>

The water strike column arced and struck the side of the airborne boar.

Receiving a heavy impact, its body bent at a right angle, and contents exploded from the opposite side of the impact.

Seeing this, Mia murmured, "I think I can hold back a bit more."

<b>

"Still three left!"

<b>

Beatrice shouted a warning as she raised a stone wall in front of the remaining charging boars.

The boars crashed into the stone wall, halting their advance, and Arvin and Lombart circled to the sides.

Then, one after another, they swung down their two-handed swords wrapped in holy energy and their battle axes, splitting the boars down the middle.

<b>

Just after they smashed the body of the third boar, a dark shadow fell over Arvin.

<b>

It was a magical beast called 'Night Bear'.

It stood over 2 meters tall, with black fur that blended into the night to ambush its prey.

<b>

It reared up on its hind legs and slashed down at Arvin with knife-like claws.

For an ordinary human, this strike would easily cleave through their skull like tofu, symbolizing despairing violence.

<b>

But in that moment, the magical sigils inscribed on Arvin's magical armor faintly glowed with magical power.

Arvin swung his left arm vigorously to deflect the Night Bear's right front paw.

A loud sound like an explosion echoed around.

<b>

Caught off guard by the unexpected counterattack, the Night Bear stumbled.

Normally, such a small opponent would be easily crushed by its own descending paw.

Yet, to its surprise, the paw was deflected, and its body swayed greatly. The bear couldn't comprehend what was happening.

<b>

But Arvin did not stop moving. He held his two-handed sword with both hands and spun around.

Then, using centrifugal force, he struck the blade of the two-handed sword into the Night Bear's exposed side.

The sword sliced through the Night Bear's tough fur and thick muscles, penetrating as far as its spine.

<b>

Arvin felt a response there. Something at the location where the blade reached.

<b>

Arvin's eyes glowed golden. His hair swayed gently.

Without hesitation, he channeled golden holy energy from the two-handed sword.

<b>

Something exploded within the Night Bear's body. The Night Bear arched its back as if jumping for a moment, but then collapsed to the ground, powerless.

<b>

"Alright!"

<b>

Arvin clenched his fist tightly.

He felt strongly that the training he had done in the academy before the outdoor class departure was paying off.

<b>

"Not yet!"

<b>

Beatrice shouted not to let their guard down.

From the depths of the forest, a large lizard with rock-like scales appeared.

A giant snake, covered in slime and lacking skin, raised its head from the underbrush.

A creature resembling a cross between a frog and a salamander clung to a thick tree trunk, staring at them with asymmetrical eyes.

<b>

"…?! These guys! They're not local magical beasts…?!"

<b>

With the enhanced vision granted to them, they saw even more of those magical beasts approaching from deeper in the forest.

The magical beasts that inhabit this area of Boltosnan should normally have a much lower threat level, around 2 or 3 at most.

However, the threat levels of the magical beasts they could see now were likely close to 10.

Many of them were visible.

According to Beatrice's knowledge, these creatures should not inhabit the Kalais region at all.

<b>

"This is troublesome! And this many…? This is definitely a bit unexpected…!"

<b>

Beatrice's words, filled with confusion, caused the three members of Amukam to exchange glances involuntarily.

<b>

"Don't panic, Bibi!"

<b>

Arvin approached Beatrice with strong strides.

His voice seemed slightly buoyant. For some reason, his eyes appeared to glimmer with excitement, anticipation, and joy.

<b>

"We're just going to do what we always do, right? Then let's go wild even more than before! Everyone's been holding back lately, right? Let's just unleash everything we've got! Right?!"

<b>

Lombart, who had been resting his chin on his hand in thought, felt the corners of his mouth involuntarily rise at Arvin's words.

Joy sparkled in Mia's eyes, and magical power began to accumulate in her magical equipment, with the light emitted from the equipment starting to spill out.

<b>

"…Seriously! Everyone's a battle-hungry tribe!"

"And you're one of them, Bibi!"

<b>

Beatrice said this with a hint of exasperation, but Mia retorted that they were all in the same boat.

For now, it seemed Beatrice wouldn't deny this.

<b>

"Well, it can't be helped!"

<b>

Beatrice sighed with a wry smile.

<b>

"Alright everyone! At this point, we can't afford to let our guard down!"

<b>

She fired up the three of them with a determined gaze.

<b>

"We just need to hold on a little longer until the 'Physical Barrier' is deployed widely!"

"Yeah!"

"Leave it to me, Bibi!"

"I might just have to push a little harder, huh?!"

<b>

Facing the unending wave of magical beasts still pouring in from the depths of the forest, the four members of Amukam raised their voices in battle fervor and stood ready to hold back the swarm.
