# 200 - Encampment Defense Line

These guys! They're still moving!"

<blank>

At the sound of Beatrice's voice, everyone turns their attention to the magical beast they thought they had defeated.

A thing flapping its arms and legs while being pierced by a root spear, and struggling to escape from it.

A thing that jitters and moves its limbs and flails about while its body is cut in two, with half its body missing.

Things that should have been killed are still moving as if it were a matter of course.

<blank>

It's a linear magical life form! It's a linear magical life form!"

<blank>

If you look closely, you can see several long, thin, thread-like objects wriggling from the wounds of the magical beast.

It grows out from the wound where the magical beast was cut in two, and wriggles around fearlessly.

<blank>

I knew it was more than just cutting and poking.

<blank>

"...... then."

<blank>

Mia puts both hands on the ground once more and meditates for a moment as it is.

<blank>

Blast! Mana Burst!"

<blank>

Mia's magic was passed through the earth to the root spear.

The next moment, the demonic beasts that had been pierced by the spears exploded one after another.

<blank>

You handled it all in one fell swoop, didn't you? Do you have the magic?

<blank>

Before leaving for the field class, the AMCAM members received a lecture from Dr. Nosori and Dr. Seiwashi on how to deal with "linear magical life forms.

That is to say, "We can directly strike magic power or holy chi into the body of a magical beast.

<blank>

What Mia just did was a "mana burst," an outburst of magical power.

He did it inside the bodies of more than a dozen magical beasts at once.

By nature, this is an act that consumes a certain amount of magical power.

Beatrice asks Mia if she is okay with the pacing of the magic? She asks.

<blank>

I'm just applying pressure to push out the magic that's originally lodged in the roots, so I'm not using that much of my own magic, am I?"

I'm going to go to ...... and see if I can find it." Then good!"

<blank>

Beatrice stopped short of further mentioning it, saying, "No problem then.

But Irving and Lombardo couldn't help but look at each other. They say it's easy to use the magic that's in residence, but ordinary people are too busy dealing with the magic inside them to do such a thing, aren't they?" The two pull a face.

He looked to Beatrice for agreement, but she merely shrugged her shoulders. 

<blank>

<blank>

There, a high-pitched scream echoed through the air. It was uttered by the demon beast, which was reduced to only its upper half of its body.

This guy hit the ground with both arms and leaped toward Irving.

The force of the arm was probably stronger than it existed. A loud thud echoed on the ground, and it flew in a straight line with its fangs bared.

<blank>

Irving let out a small breath and with a slight movement, he thrust out his two-handed sword at the approaching sole.

In an instant, the sword tip, clothed in holy chi, thrusts into the magical beast without any resistance, easily piercing its body.

At the same time, the body of the magical beast suddenly swelled up all at once from the inside.

Immediately after that, the body of the magical beast rapidly shrinks like a deflated balloon and slips down the blade of the two-handed sword, losing its power.

The white nematode-like creature that had been visible earlier was no longer in the wounds of the beast that had fallen to the ground and shriveled up.

<blank>

Yes, it's enough to get me there."

<blank>

Lombard also swung his battleaxe, raised above his head, at the body of the magical beast writhing on the ground.

The pieces of flesh of the beast that were blown off by the impact cannot be confirmed to be wriggling any more.

<blank>

He said that if you break them up into so many pieces, they can't exist after all.

<blank>

Irving shrugs as he looks at the piece of meat, to which Lombardo replies with a small "Hm.

<blank>

First of all, we were able to confirm that we could deal with "linear magical life forms" by following the instructions of the doctors.

At the same time, it tells us that this time, too, Kore is involved.

If so, who is behind this ....... Irving's mouth hangs viciously.

<blank>

Next! It's coming!"

<blank>

Almost as soon as Beatrice raises her voice, a small magical beast flies in from among the trees.

They were magical beasts called "star girats," which look like flying squirrels. Several of them came gliding down from the trees.

But then, one by one, the branches of the tree grow up and pierce its body.

It's Mia's 'branch spear'.

The spears of the branches strike the prey one after another in the air. The prey explodes on the spot and falls to the ground without power.

<blank>

Even those who escaped the spears were struck down by Irving's two-handed sword.

When the blade clothed in holy chi pierces its body, the small demonic beast explodes on the spot.

<blank>

Lombardo uses a battle-axe in his hand to strike away at the small magical beasts that come flying in one after another.

All of the magical beasts struck by the massive battleaxe explode on the spot.

<blank>

I'd have no problem at all with a small opponent like this."

A medium-size one won't make a difference.

But you have to be careful with the big ones. The teacher said that if you are bigger than a human, there is a convergence of 'linear magical life forms' in your body.

<blank>

The three of them confirm their own use of "magic power" and their handling of "Ki" as they deal with the magical beasts that come flying in one after another.

Small ones are no problem. But Mia cautions that this is not the case with large objects.

<blank>

What is it? They're all gathered together deep inside the body, so you have to hit them directly with magic or Ki?"

That's right. The center of the body is generated by many "linear magical organisms" that are gathered together like a plexus. No matter how much you attack the ends of the body, such as the limbs, you cannot stop the regeneration of the body, so you have to do something about that central part.

Then you've got to actually try it, right?

<blank>

Irving flashed his two-handed sword at the last stargillat that flew by, turning it into a spray of blood.

<blank>

The number of stargill rats we have defeated in this short time has exceeded 30.

Even in Amcam, it is not common for this many to spring up at once.

<blank>

You can try as many as you want! Here! Next!

<blank>

Beatrice applies "Vital Up" to the vanguard, Lombard and Irving.

The stamina of the two is enhanced.

<blank>

Lombardo held his battleaxe in his right, backhanded, with the axe held horizontally and thrust forward.

<blank>

The beast that ran through the trees sets its fangs on the thick hilt of its battle-axe.

Terror Dog."

They are 1.5-meter-long, mountain-dog magical beasts that attack their prey in packs.

Lombardo spun his battle-axe as if it were a baton and flicked it away.

As it is, the centrifugal force ridden axe is slammed into the flank of the terra dog, which continues to dive into the air.

<blank>

Another terra dog leaps at Lombard, passing through to snatch his companion, who is sent flying by Axe.

However, Irving cut it in two with a two-handed sword slashed up from below. At the same time, the wound exploded with Irving's holy energy.

<blank>

From behind the exploding terra dog, two black-furred "dark foxes" pounced, this time toward Irving.

However, it was pierced from below by a tree root that turned into a spear.

The body bursts at the same time as it is pierced.

<blank>

Irving slays the demonic beasts that Lombardt has gathered, and Mia's magic pierces through them. However, the number of the approaching demonic beasts increases with each passing hour.

<blank>

Don't let your guard down! If you let loose, they'll break through easily!"

I know!

<blank>

Lombardo slammed his battleaxe into the ground in the middle of the magical beasts he had gathered.

<blank>

Rock Cracker."

The rocky mass under Lombardo's feet bursts apart as if in an explosion.

Along with the mass of rock, many of the demonic beasts that had gathered in Lombard were also blown away.

Branches and roots of trees become spears one after another, piercing through the beasts.

<blank>

I'm tempted to just use the 'small flame randori' and wipe them out with the ------! I'd like to wipe them out!

<blank>

Mia complains that she has already dealt with a considerable number of magical beasts, but the number of magical beasts that are still coming in unceasingly is making her impatient.

<blank>

Don't use it by mistake! Unlike the Amukamu Forest, the trees here are not resistant to magic! If you try to use fire magic, which is a bit more powerful, it will cause a forest fire in no time and you will all be swallowed by the sea of fire!

<blank>

I know, I know, Vivi. I was just saying and seeing."

<blank>

Mia looked batty and looked away, scratching her cheek with her fingertips.

He then put his hand on the ground again and produced several spears, muttering, "Well, I'm going to try various things.

<blank>

<blank>

Vibrations like drums echoed and transmitted from the ground.

Beatrice and her colleagues immediately recognize the vibration as something heavy running.

<blank>

Gray Fang Boa.

It is a magical beast of a boar about 1.5 meters long.

It has fur as hard as stone and a protruding snout with four large fangs on each side.

The force with which it rushes through the stone walls of a house is like paper, and it is impossible for an ordinary guard to hold it back, even with a five-man force.

<blank>

Now one of them is coming at me furiously.

But Lombard stood in front of Sole without fear, held his battle-axe horizontally in both hands, held it out in front of him, and quietly sat down.

<blank>

Immediately after, Lombard and the magical beast collide violently.

The aftermath of the collision spread around the area as vibrations echoed in my lower stomach.

Lombardo's feet scrape the ground and lower slightly.

Boa, on the other hand, is bounced from his spot and sprawls in the air.

Its snout was twisted and crooked, and its large fangs were shattered and scattered all around.

<blank>

The magic bead on Mia's glove, which she holds out her hand toward it, is tinged with blue light.

Water hammer."

The mass of water created by Mia becomes a pillar of water 20 centimeters in diameter and about one meter long, accelerating toward its target.

<blank>

The column of water shot formed a large arc and struck the side of the bore, which was suspended in mid-air as if it were spinning around.

Under the heavy impact, the body was bent sideways into a crisscrossing shape, and the contents splattered out from the opposite side of the blow as if exploding.

Mia confirms this, "Do you think we can go a little more restrained?" Mia mutters, "I wonder if I can go a little more restrained.

<blank>

Still three!"

<blank>

Beatrice shouted a warning and let the stone wall stretch up in front of the rest of the onrushing boa.

Irving and Lombardo flank the boa, which stops dead in its tracks after being blocked by a stone wall and crashing into it.

Then, one after another, they swung down their battleaxes, two-handed swords clad in holy chi, and split the boa's body in two, spine by spine.

<blank>

Immediately after smashing the body of the third boa, a black shadow fell over Irving's head.

<blank>

It is a magical beast of a bear called "Night Bear".

They are over two meters long, and their black body hairs allow them to hide in the dark and attack their prey.

<blank>

It rose up on its hind legs and came down with knife-like claws at Irving.

It is a blow that is a symbol of hopeless violence, and if you are an ordinary human being, your cranium will be gouged out as lightly as tofu.

<blank>

At that moment, however, the magic seal engraved on Irving's magical armor is faintly tinged with a glow of magical power.

As Bear's right foreleg was being struck down, Irving swung his own left arm vigorously, powerfully knocking it away.

A loud sound like a rupture echoes around the area.

<blank>

The unexpected counterattack made the night bears flinch.

Normally, such a small opponent should be easily crushed by his own striking paw.

The paws are bounced back, and even the body is staggered. Bear could not understand what was happening.

<blank>

But Irving did not stop moving, and he continued to hold the two-handed sword in both hands, spinning widely on the spot.

Then, with centrifugal force, he slams the blade of his two-handed sword as hard as he can into Night Bear's open flank.

The two-handed sword sliced through the nightbear's hard fur and thick muscles, the blade passing near its spine.

<blank>

Irving felt a response there. Something in the place where the blade reached.

<blank>

Irving's eyes took on a golden hue. His hair shimmered.

Without a pause, he then goes on to strike the golden holly chi from his two-handed sword.

<blank>

Something exploded inside Night Bear's body. For a moment, Night Bear's body buckled as if he were bouncing, but then he collapsed to the ground without effort.

<blank>

Yes!"

<blank>

Irving clenches a small fist.

He felt strongly now that the training he had been doing in the school before the departure of the outdoor class was paying off.

<blank>

Not yet!"

<blank>

Beatrice shouts for us not to let our guard down.

A large lizard with rock-like scales emerges from behind the trees.

A huge snake, its skinless body covered with mucus, raised its sickle from the bushes.

An amphibian, somewhere between a frog and a newt, stuck to the trunk of a thick tree and looked at us with asymmetrical eyes.

<blank>

"......? These guys! Not those hexenbiests around here. ......?!"

<blank>

Their eyes, which had been given the ability to see through the darkness, caught sight of more of those magical beasts approaching from the depths of the forest.

Most of the monsters and beasts that inhabit this area of Boltzunan are supposed to have a lower threat value, around 2 or 3 at the most.

But the threat value of the monsters we see now is probably closer to 10.

I see several of them.

Even with Beatrice's knowledge, at the very least, these are magical beasts that do not live in the state of Calais.

<blank>

I'm in a bind." That's how many ......? A bit unexpected, don't you think? ......!

<blank>

The three Amcam members involuntarily looked at each other in bewilderment, which was not typical of Beatrice.

<blank>

Don't panic, Bibi!"

<blank>

Irving comes up to Beatrice's side with strong steps.

His voice sounded slightly bouncy. For some reason, his eyes seemed to be filled with excitement, anticipation, and joy.

<blank>

"What are we going to do anyway? Then let's go wild more than ever! I'm sure you've all been feeling a little pent up lately, right? Let's take this opportunity to go all out! Hey!

<blank>

Lombard, who had been placing his hand over his mouth in contemplation, felt the corners of his mouth under his hand involuntarily turn up at Irving's words.

Mia's eyes light up with joy, her magical equipment begins to accumulate magic power, and the light emitted by the equipment begins to spill out into the surrounding area.

<blank>

"...... at all! They're all fighting people!"

So did Bibi, so did I!"

<blank>

Beatrice tells the three of them that they are all in the same boat. Mia replied that they were all in the same boat.

At any rate, Beatrice does not seem to deny this.

<blank>

I can't help it!"

<blank>

Beatrice let out a sigh with a wry smile.

<blank>

Come on, guys! This is the place to be! There's no time to relax now!"

<blank>

He further informs the three of them with his eyes filled with power.

<blank>

I'm going to go with a little more gusto until the 'physical barrier' is deployed here over a wide area!"

Oh!"

I got it, Bibi!

Let's get a little more serious for a second!"

<blank>

The four members of AMCAM shouted in high spirits as they faced the endless stream of monsters and beasts still coming from the depths of the forest, and they stood up to hold back the hordes.
