# 34 Henry Jameson's Penance

Suzy ended up having tea at the workshop with Henry, who came to pick her up.

<blank>

Suzy, who has taken a liking to Marsh, is asking him a lot of questions ....... If he's such a good user, I'll make a few more tweaks to the leather armor. I'll get to work on it as soon as I get back from King's Landing, so bring it to me next time.　Marsh seemed to be getting quite excited all by himself.

<blank>

Suzy also seemed to be particularly pleased with the lemon cake that Mariebelle had served, and was happily eating it while listening to Marsh's story.

<blank>

<blank>

So we ended up leaving Copetown around 4:00 p.m.

<blank>

I must hurry, or the sun will go down. I'm afraid Master Cloud will scold me for this."

<blank>

Suzy chuckled.

<blank>

But, Mr. Dwarf, I've never seen you before.

I see that there are no dwarves in Amkham now, which is understandable.

<blank>

He told Henry of his surprise at meeting the dwarves for the first time.

<blank>

<blank>

Besides, there are a few other species in Copetown.

<blank>

Is that so?　Suzy asks back.

<blank>

I knew that there was a species of glassfoot in Amcam.

With their settlement west of Amkam, Suzy hardly ever sees them.

But I had seen a large group of people coming to help when the wheat was being harvested.

He was only as tall as a child, but that made him an adult.

I was told that they usually do not wear shoes and are a very agile species.

<blank>

I had never heard of any other species before, so I asked what kind of people were there.

<blank>

If you are not a Dwarf, there are also Elves. By the way, Cecily, the woman who runs the store where Susie buys her clothes, is a half-elf.

Whew!

<blank>

Suzy made a funny noise, surprised that she had already encountered it.

<blank>

Some half-elves have shorter ears than their pure-blood counterparts, so it's harder for many to tell them apart, depending on their hair style."

<blank>

(I see... ......, so you are saying that elves have long ears even here? That's a relief. I must meet a pure-blood elf!)

<blank>

In the westernmost village of Argosi, which is also in Amkham County, there are people of various races because of its proximity to the border. If you go further to the royal capital, it is a melting pot of races. ......

<blank>

(Hmmm, I don't know if I want to go there or not. ......)

<blank>

<blank>

We were on our way home with such conversation.

On the way there, Henry saw that Suzy had been carrying the sword all the way and suggested that she put it in the back of the truck. ......

<blank>

Sonia told me that I was her second daughter. She said, "Sonia, you told me that I am your second daughter, after Ravi. I'm not going to let go of this sword now. That's why I don't want to let go of this sword now.

<blank>

Suzy said, and hugged her sword with one of her strongest hugs.

<blank>

...... I see, you asked about Mr. Ravi?"

I know I can't replace you, but I'm glad you feel this way, Howard.

<blank>

Susie said and let out a smile as she looked at Henry.

<blank>

<blank>

"I see ......, Master Cloud is ...... so?"

<blank>

Henry nodded repeatedly, looking pleased.

Then he spins his words as if looking into the distance.

<blank>

"I could not save ...... those two people, no, not just the two of them. I could not save any of the villagers. ......

Henry... sir?"

<blank>

"But Suzy, you have lit a definite warmth in the hearts of both of us. ......

"・・・・・・"

I could never have done it. ...... It was only hubris that I, with my pride and selfishness, could save people. As a servant of the gods, I could not be more ashamed.

"Oh, no! You're not that kind of a man, sir!"

<blank>

I was such a person. I was such a pathetic person that I didn't even know that I couldn't do anything. ...... I am sorry Suzy, this is my penance. And it is also my request ......, will you please listen to me?"

"...Dr. Henry."

<blank>

I don't think it was a coincidence that you came to me, Mr. Cloud. I believed that there was a definite intention and fate behind it. What those intentions are, a small person like me cannot know. However, I am convinced once and for all that the connection between you and the Cloud family is solid. You are family. You are definitely related by that bond."

"He... Henry... sen... se... ah, thank you... thank you... sir."

<blank>

Suzy chokes up.

<blank>

Please cherish your connection and let your light grow ...... and if you can, share your light with the people of ...... village."

I love you, Howard and Sonia. Elrose and Gilbert. I love Mia, Bibi, Colin, Dana, and all the children at school! I love Amkam and the people of Amkam village!

Thank you ......, thank you, Susie."

<blank>

Henry thanked Suzy for her reassurance and quietly drove off in the carriage.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Henry Jameson used to teach magicology and conduct "heroic" research at a university in King's Landing.

<blank>

In modern times, research on "heroes" is positioned similar to folklore, which is the study of fairy tales and other folklore.

<blank>

<blank>

By nature, this is a different field for Henry, who specializes in magical studies.

However, Henry was convinced that research into "heroic lore" would lead to research into "otherworldly magic" and "otherworldly travel.

<blank>

So when he heard that the Amkham Village Temple was looking for a new temple head, he jumped at the chance.

<blank>

From the perspective of the royal capital, Amkham is a frontier fruit.

No one wants to go there.

Moreover, it is an extremely dangerous magical land that is constantly threatened by the appearance of magical beasts.

The villagers must be uneducated and barbaric, as befits the inhabitants of such a danger zone.

......That was the perception of most people living in the royal city toward AMCAM.

<blank>

But none of that matters to Henry.

Deep in the forest of Amukam, which is full of magical beasts, lies the secret that will lead to the "hero".

The "Great Forest of Unexplored Iroshio," the forest of Amkamu, where the heroes are said to have manifested.

What is the hesitation in going there?

<blank>

Uneducated and barbaric? Such a person should be guided and taught by me.

Even if someone is wounded in a battle with a magical beast, I, who hold the rank of "priest," can awaken them from the brink of death.

Why not let me be their salvation?

<blank>

Henry was elated and inaugurated to the Amcam Village Temple.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Henry Jameson will never forget that day.

<blank>

The calamity that struck the village that day had breached the walls of the temple and entered its interior, destroying even the sacred altar.

<blank>

Henry stood speechless as he stared at the miasma, a stench so thick and so disastrous that it was suffocatingly thick and filled with the stench of decay and filth.

Faster than he could regain his halted thoughts, the calamity kicked Henry in the teeth.

He was barely able to save his life because the life-saving items he was wearing were effective.

<blank>

When Henry regained consciousness and finally crawled out of the rubble, he was confronted with a horrifying sight.

<blank>

The infants were cruelly rolled and thrown down in front of the altar, which was destroyed in a mockery of the gods' majesty, and lost their lives.

They were probably trying to protect their children. Several young people were lying on the ground, dead or alive.

<blank>

In the midst of all this, the only man with a gray head held a girl in his arms, calling out her name over and over as if to awaken her.

<blank>

It was Howard Cloud and his daughter, Lavinia, who were in charge of organizing the Amkam Protectorate in this village.

<blank>

Henry could do nothing but stand dumbfounded amidst the rubble as Howard's plaintive cries echoed through the air.

<blank>

<blank>

Three days after that tragedy, Henry visited the Cloud family.

<blank>

Immediately after that, Henry recovered from his state of oblivion and immediately treated Lavinia.

But while he was able to heal the physical damage, Henry had no control over the lost astral body and some of the manas.

<blank>

Upon entering the Cloud family compound, Henry's eyes caught a glimpse of Howard sitting stunned in the doorway.

Henry instantly understood what had happened to the haggard, vacant-eyed Howard.

<blank>

Still, ......, you can't just walk away from this.

There were not even words to say, but Henry still kneeled beside Howard, placed a fearful hand on his shoulder, and spoke in a muffled voice.

<blank>

"Dear ............ cloud ......"

<blank>

Howard is moving his mouth as if mumbling something, not even looking at him, as if he is unaware that Henry is there.

<blank>

Henry moved his face closer to hear better, wondering if Howard was trying to tell him something.

Eventually, Howard's voice is faintly audible.

<blank>

"Ravi is ......, Ravi is dead ......"

<blank>

Henry quickly pulled his hand back and grabbed and clutched his own chest.

The light of life in Lavinia had gone out.

<blank>

Henry had heard rumors of Howard in King's Landing before.

He is a demigod who, when he was still active, went around many battlefields and destroyed all kinds of demonic beasts, barbarians, and demons like wildfire.

Legend has it that after the battle, he would burn his enemies to the ground and leave no ashes. The Gray Iron God

<blank>

Many people who did not know how to fight and who were from the city ridiculed him as a country savage.

But Howard, whom I actually met, was indeed a warm and genial man.

He treated Henry, a stranger, as if he were an old acquaintance who knew him well.

<blank>

Sonia is generous, kind, and friendly with everyone.

Lavinia was raised by them and was a vivacious, fearless girl with a strong sense of justice.

Howard's doting love for his daughter, the family's concern for each other, and the family's happiness from the side.

<blank>

<blank>

Such a family is now disintegrating before our eyes.

From inside the house came Sonia's plaintive cries.

It's a scream-like cry that doesn't even try to stifle its voice, but just wants to deny the fact.

<blank>

I noticed that Howard was staring at me with vacant eyes.

Henry went straight to Howard, who grabbed him by both shoulders.

<blank>

Although he has retired from active duty, Howard, who still trains daily, is so powerful that Henry cannot even move.

Howard stared into Henry's eyes and spit out his words.

<blank>

'Lavi is ......, Lavinia is dead! Lavi is! ...... my... our Lavi is ...... dead!"

<blank>

Henry could only take Howard's lamentations in his body.

It was at this point that he came to his senses.

The young children who were cast down in front of the altar, the young men who sacrificed themselves to protect them, and this family.

I have not saved myself in any way.

It has no power.

What an extravagant idea to save and lead others!

<blank>

Henry was already away from Henry, and as he stared at Howard with his hands on the ground and tears streaming down his face, he knew with a pain that tore at his chest that he was helpless.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It has been 10 years since that day ....... Time enough for them to regain their composure.

However, this does not diminish the painful memories.

They still carry a constant pain in their hearts and were never saved.

<blank>

But this girl, with her smile, gave warmth to the hearts of those two people before they could see it.

That is something I have not been able to do for the past 10 years.

<blank>

Henry believed that if there was such a thing as a "hero" or "savior," it was someone who would bring hope and joy to people.

<blank>

Then, after all, this child is the "Savior".

To Henry, Suzy is the second coming of the "hero," even if no one else, including himself, will admit it.

<blank>

Henry could not help but be grateful for this guidance.

He was praying silently to the gods he served, finding joy in his heart.

<blank>

<blank>

But it is abruptly interrupted by Suzy's nervous voice.

<blank>

Sir, there's something wrong with the village.

<blank>

The village can be reached by crossing the river at the village border.

It's about another kilometer from here.

<blank>

Henry switched his attention to Suzy's words and concentrated on exploring what was beyond.

<blank>

What's this ominous presence?

<blank>

Henry could feel a disastrous and hair-raising presence rising from the depths of the village.

Moreover, I remember this nauseating, malevolent presence.

<blank>

This! ...... Oh no! No way!"

Sir, I'm coming!

<blank>

Susie put her hat on the back of the truck, put on her sword belt and stood up.

<blank>

Sir, please hurry straight to the temple.

"Susie, you are ...... and you are ......."

Don't worry, sir, I'll clean up the road to the temple.

<blank>

Suzy said this as she looked quietly ahead down the road.

Henry huffs at the sight and looks back down the road he is now on.

Then he slowly returned his gaze to Suzy and spoke calmly.

<blank>

"Suzy, can you take care of the ...... village and all the villagers?"

<blank>

Suzy responded, smiling softly.

<blank>

Yes, sir, I'll take care of it. The teacher, too, as soon as possible, to the Temple."

<blank>

With that, he jumped off the wagon with ease and ran down the road like a gust of wind.

<blank>

Henry's eyes widened in surprise at Suzy's speed, but his cheeks relaxed in relief.

And once again, he gave deep thanks to the gods he serves.

<blank>

Henry hurried the wagon down the road to Amkam as the sun began to set.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Fiorina Utley was a girl who took good care of her underclassmen, who this term became the 6th dan and the most senior student in the middle ranks.

<blank>

Her orange-brown hair, tied back with a lapis lazuli ribbon, swung behind her as she walked down the passageway connecting the school building and the research wing of the magic class toward her laboratory.

<blank>

Fiorina was returning to the classroom to pick up Eva Avans' belongings, who had enrolled this semester.

It's already 3:00 p.m., I have to get back soon.

Normally, the children in the lower grades should be out of school by now.

<blank>

However, Eva and the other first dan children who joined the magic group for the first time today were so absorbed by the magic tools they saw for the first time that they forgot that it was almost time to go home, and seemed to be a little over-excited.

<blank>

Colin pointed out to me that it was past time to leave, and I started putting away my magic gear. ......

Eva remembered that she had left her basket in the classroom and wanted to go get it.

Fiorina, however, left Eva to clean up the mess with the others and went out to pick it up for her.

<blank>

When Fiorina found Eva's basket and was walking back to the lab, she suddenly noticed something and looked outside the school.

Then I saw a child behind a tree standing at the entrance to the school property.

<blank>

(Huh? Where is she from? I've never seen you before.)

<blank>

As I watched, the child peeked out from behind a tree as if peering into the school, repeatedly asking whether to go or come back.

<blank>

(Is it an errand to the school? Someone's relative's kid?)

<blank>

Fiorina has always had a caring nature.

There was no way I could leave the little boy in trouble.

Without any hesitation, I went straight off the aisle, approached the child, and called out to her.

<blank>

"Hey, you, uh, you need something from school? Do you know anyone here?"

<blank>

He is a pale, fair-faced, dark-haired boy.

He was not even ten years old when he was born, he was very small.

The boy bends down to talk to Fiorina, who is looking at him closely, and the boy seems to be a little embarrassed.

<blank>

Yeah, they told me to come here. He told me to wait for him inside.

I don't know. Are you related to someone after all? Hey, did someone tell you to meet me?"

<blank>

The boy shakes his head as if to say he doesn't know.

<blank>

I don't know what to do. If we go to ...... lab, Colin and Bibi are there, and ......, do you know whose relatives they are?"

<blank>

Beatrice looks like that, but she has the widest face in this village of the school.

If we could get her to meet with him, she might be able to tell us something.

Fiorina decides to do so and reaches out to the boy.

<blank>

<blank>

You can't stay here, so come with me. Let's go with them and see if we can find out who you know."

<blank>

Looking upward at the outstretched hand.

<blank>

"I'm ......, can I go inside ......?"

It's not a matter of course. We have to go inside to meet everyone. Come on."

Thanks, sis!"

<blank>

The boy said this happily, and then he grabbed Fiorina's hand and stepped straight into the premises.

<blank>

Fiorina's face became tense for a moment because the boy's hand was so cold in hers.

However, I noticed the boy looking up at me with a smile, and I smiled back.

<blank>

(I wonder if I got chilled from the wind? The wind from the north is something cold today. ......)

<blank>

I asked the boy, alone and convinced like that.

<blank>

Right? Speaking of which, what's your name? Can you tell me?"

<blank>

Yes, of course. My name is Doug. My name is Doug.

Howard rages!
