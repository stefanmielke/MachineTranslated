# Chapter 34: The Confession of Henry Jameson

In the end, Suzy decided to have tea in the workshop with Henry, who had come to pick her up.

<b>

Completely charmed by Marsh, Suzy was bombarded with various questions... "If you're this skilled, I should make a few more adjustments to the leather armor. I'll get started as soon as I return from the capital, so bring it next time." Before she knew it, she had secured a promise, and Marsh seemed to be quite excited on his own.

<b>

Suzy also seemed particularly pleased with the lemon cake that Marie Bell had served, happily enjoying it while listening to Marsh's stories.

<b>

<b>

Due to all this, they ended up leaving Coop Town after 4 PM.

<b>

"If we don't hurry, the sun will set. I might get scolded by Lord Cloud."

<b>

Suzy said with a wry smile.

<b>

"But, Mr. Dwarf, this is the first time I've met one."

"Is that so? There's no dwarf in Amukam right now, so it's understandable."

<b>

She conveyed her surprise at meeting a dwarf for the first time to Henry.

<b>

<b>

"Moreover, there are some other races in Coop Town as well."

<b>

"Is that so?" Suzy asked back.

<b>

She knew that there was a race called Glassfoot in Amukam.

However, she rarely saw them, as they lived in a settlement to the west of Amukam.

But she had noticed many of them coming to help during the wheat harvest.

They were said to be adults despite being only as tall as children.

She was told that they usually went barefoot and were a very agile race.

<b>

Since it was her first time hearing about other races, she asked what kind of people lived there.

<b>

"Besides dwarves, there are also elves. By the way, Cecily, the shopkeeper where you bought your clothes, is a half-elf."

"Wh-what!?"

<b>

Suzy exclaimed in surprise, realizing she had already encountered one.

<b>

"Half-elves can have shorter ears compared to pure-blooded elves, so depending on their hairstyle, it can be hard to tell them apart."

<b>

(I see... So even here, elves have long ears! That makes me feel somewhat relieved. I definitely want to meet a pure-blooded elf!)

<b>

By the way, she had heard that in the westernmost village of Argoshi, which borders the kingdom, there were various races present. Furthermore, if one went to the capital, it was said to be a melting pot of races...

<b>

(Hmmm, I want to go, but I also don't...)

<b>

<b>

They were having such a conversation as they made their way home.

Along the way, Henry suggested that Suzy place the sword on the cart since she had been holding it the whole time...

<b>

"Sonia told me. I'm the second daughter, the next daughter after Ravi. Howard also said that this sword is for my daughter. So, I don't want to let go of this sword now."

<b>

Suzy said, hugging the sword tightly.

<b>

"...I see, you've heard about Ravi, haven't you?"

"Yes, I can't replace Ravi, but I'm still happy that Howard feels this way about me."

<b>

Suzy said, looking at Henry and smiling.

<b>

<b>

"I see... Lord Cloud... I see."

<b>

Henry nodded several times with a happy expression.

Then he began to weave words as if looking far away.

<b>

"I... could not save those two... No, it wasn't just them. I couldn't save a single villager..."

"Henry... Sensei?"

<b>

"But Suzy, you have certainly lit a warm light in their hearts..."

"......"

"I could never have done such a thing... It was nothing but arrogance for someone like me, who held selfish pride, to think I could save people. There is nothing more shameful for someone who serves the gods."

"That's not true! You are not that kind of person!"

<b>

"Yes, Suzy, I was that kind of person. I was a pitiful human being who couldn't even understand that I could do nothing... I apologize, Suzy, this is my confession. And it is also my request... Will you listen to me?"

"...Henry Sensei."

<b>

"I do not believe that your appearance before Lord Cloud was a coincidence. I believe there is a definite intention and connection there. I have no way of knowing what that intention is, as I am but a small being. However, I am now certain that the bond between you and the Cloud family is real. You are family. Undoubtedly bound by that connection."

"Th-thank you... Henry... Sensei..."

<b>

Suzy's voice faltered.

<b>

"Please cherish that bond and nurture the light... And if possible... please share that light with the villagers as well."

"Sensei, I love Howard, Sonia, and everyone! I love Elrose, Gilbert, Mia, Bibi, Colin, Dana, and all the children! I love Amukam and the people of Amukam!"

"Thank you... Thank you, Suzy."

<b>

Henry expressed his gratitude to Suzy, who seemed relieved, as he quietly urged the carriage onward.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

Henry Jameson once taught magic at the university in the capital while researching "heroes."

<b>

In modern times, studying "heroes" is akin to researching folklore and fairy tales.

<b>

<b>

Originally, this was outside the realm of expertise for Henry, who specialized in magic.

However, he was convinced that studying "heroic legends" would lead to research on "otherworldly magic" and "interdimensional travel."

<b>

When he heard that they were looking for someone to take the position of the head priest at the Amukam village temple, he jumped at the opportunity without hesitation.

<b>

From the capital's perspective, Amukam was a remote frontier.

Few desired to go there.

Moreover, it was a perilous magical realm constantly threatened by the emergence of magical beasts.

The villagers were undoubtedly uneducated and barbaric, fitting for the residents of such a dangerous area.

...That was the perception of most people living in the capital regarding Amukam.

<b>

However, for Henry, such matters were irrelevant.

Deep within the beast-infested forests of Amukam lay secrets that connected to "heroes."

The forest of Amukam, known as the "Great Forest of the Secret Realm Iroshio," where heroes were said to have manifested.

What hesitation could there be in going there?

<b>

Uneducated and barbaric? I could guide and teach them.

Even if someone were injured fighting magical beasts, as a "priest," I could awaken them from the brink of death.

I could be their salvation!

<b>

With such determination, Henry took up his post at the Amukam village temple.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Henry Jameson could never forget that day.

<b>

On that day, the calamity that struck the village broke through the temple walls and invaded its interior, even destroying the sacred altar.

<b>

The evil that was most unfit for that sacred place was so thick and malevolent that it choked the air, filling it with the stench of decay and filth, leaving Henry speechless and frozen in place.

Before he could regain his halted thoughts, the calamity struck him down.

He barely managed to cling to life thanks to the life-saving item he was wearing.

<b>

When he regained consciousness and crawled out from the rubble, a horrifying scene unfolded before his eyes.

<b>

Before the altar, destroyed as if mocking the divine majesty, lay the lifeless bodies of children, discarded and left behind.

Perhaps they had tried to protect those children. Several young people lay collapsed, their fates uncertain.

<b>

Among them, a single man with gray hair held a girl in his arms, repeatedly calling her name in an effort to awaken her.

<b>

It was Howard Cloud, the leader of the Amukam Defense Corps, and his daughter, Lavinia.

<b>

Henry could only stand there, dumbfounded, as Howard's anguished cries echoed through the rubble.

<b>

<b>

Three days after that tragedy, Henry visited the Cloud family.

<b>

Immediately after that moment, once he had regained his senses, Henry had treated Lavinia.

However, while he could heal her physical injuries, he could do nothing about the lost astral body and part of her mana.

<b>

As Henry entered the Cloud family grounds, he saw Howard sitting there, dazed.

He looked utterly worn out, and Henry instantly understood what had happened.

<b>

Yet... he could not simply walk away.

Though he had no words to offer, he knelt beside Howard, cautiously placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke in a barely audible voice.

<b>

"......Lord Cloud..."

<b>

Howard seemed not to notice Henry's presence, muttering something to himself without looking at him.

<b>

Henry leaned closer, trying to catch what Howard was trying to convey.

Eventually, he could faintly hear Howard's voice.

<b>

"Lavi... Lavi is dead..."

<b>

Henry instinctively pulled his hand back and clutched his own chest.

The light of Lavinia's life had gone out.

<b>

Henry had heard rumors about Howard back in the capital.

Once a legendary warrior who had traversed countless battlefields, annihilating magical beasts, barbarians, and demons like a raging inferno.

It was said that after his battles, he left no trace of his enemies, not even ashes. The "Gray Iron Demon."

<b>

Those who had never known battle, especially city dwellers, often mocked him as a barbarian from the countryside.

But the Howard he met was a warm and gentle person.

He treated Henry, a stranger, as if they were old friends.

<b>

Sonia was open-hearted and kind, treating everyone with friendliness.

Lavinia, raised by those two, was a lively girl full of justice and fearlessness.

The love Howard had for his daughter and the mutual care within the family created a happy atmosphere that was evident to outsiders.

<b>

<b>

Now, that family was collapsing before Henry's eyes.

From inside the house, Sonia's heart-wrenching cries echoed.

She did not even try to stifle her voice, simply letting out a scream of denial against the harsh reality.

<b>

Before he knew it, Howard's vacant eyes widened, staring at him.

Henry found himself gripped by Howard's strong hands on his shoulders.

<b>

Even though he had retired, Howard still trained daily, and his strength was great enough that Henry could not move.

While staring into Henry's eyes, Howard spoke as if he were spitting out words.

<b>

"Lavi... Lavinia is gone! Lavi!!... My... our Lavi...!!"

<b>

Henry could only receive Howard's wails in silence.

At that moment, he realized.

The children discarded before the altar, the young people who sacrificed themselves to protect them, and this family.

He had saved nothing.

He had no power.

What arrogance it was to think he could save and guide others.

<b>

As he stood there, staring blankly at Howard, who had already distanced himself and was now on the ground, weeping uncontrollably, Henry felt his own powerlessness pierce through him like a knife.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Ten years had passed since that day... The passage of time was more than enough for them to regain their composure.

However, it did not diminish the painful memories.

They still carried the pain deep within their hearts, having never been saved.

<b>

But this girl, with her smile, had quickly brought warmth to the hearts of those two.

That was something Henry had been unable to do in the past ten years.

<b>

If there are beings called "heroes" or "saviors," Henry believed they were those who brought hope and joy to people.

<b>

Then, indeed, this child was the "savior."

Regardless of whether anyone else recognized it, for Henry, Suzy was the reincarnated "hero."

<b>

Henry could not help but feel grateful for this guidance.

As he found joy within himself, he quietly prayed to the gods he served.

<b>

<b>

But suddenly, Suzy's tense voice interrupted him.

<b>

"Sensei, something is wrong with the village..."

<b>

They would arrive at the village after crossing the river at the village boundary ahead.

It was only about a kilometer from here.

<b>

Henry shifted his focus to Suzy's words and concentrated on the situation ahead.

<b>

"W-what is this ominous presence!?"

<b>

Henry also sensed a dreadful, hair-raising aura rising from deep within the village.

Moreover, he recognized this nauseating, malevolent presence.

<b>

"This is! ...No way!"

"Sensei, I'm going!"

<b>

Suzy placed her hat on the cart, strapped on her sword belt, and stood up.

<b>

"Please go straight to the temple, hurry."

"Suzy... you..."

"I'm fine, Sensei. I'll clear the path to the temple."

<b>

Suzy said, gazing quietly down the road ahead.

Henry was startled by her demeanor and looked back at the path they were about to take.

Then he slowly returned his gaze to Suzy and spoke gently.

<b>

"Suzy... can I ask you to look after the village and everyone in it?"

<b>

Suzy answered with a soft smile.

<b>

"Yes, Sensei, leave it to me. Please hurry to the temple as quickly as you can."

<b>

With that, she leaped lightly from the carriage and ran down the path like a gust of wind, disappearing ahead.

<b>

Henry's eyes widened in surprise at Suzy's speed, but he relaxed his cheeks with a sigh of relief.

And once again, he offered deep gratitude to the gods he served.

<b>

Henry urged the carriage onward along the road, which was beginning to slope down toward Amukam as the sun began to set.

<b>

<b>

Fiorina Atlee was a kind girl who had become a sixth-year student and was good at looking after the younger students.

<b>

Now, she was walking toward the research room along the corridor connecting the school building and the magic department's research building, her orange-brown hair tied back with a sapphire ribbon swaying behind her.

<b>

Fiorina was returning to the classroom to collect the belongings of Eva Avance, who had just enrolled this term.

It was already past 3 PM; she needed to hurry back.

Normally, the lower-level students should have already left school by this time.

<b>

However, the first-year students, including Eva, who had participated in the magic department for the first time today, seemed to have gotten carried away with the many magical tools they were seeing for the first time, forgetting the time to leave.

<b>

When Colin pointed out that it was past their leaving time, they started tidying up the magical tools...

But then, Eva remembered that she had left her basket in the classroom and wanted to go back to get it.

However, Fiorina stepped in, saying that she would go retrieve it while letting Eva continue tidying up with everyone.

<b>

As Fiorina found Eva's basket and was walking back to the research room, she suddenly noticed something and shifted her gaze outside the school grounds.

There, behind a tree at the entrance of the school grounds, she spotted a child.

<b>

(Huh? Whose child is that? I don't recognize that face.)

<b>

As she watched, the child peeked out from behind the tree, hesitating between going in or turning back.

<b>

(Is there something they need at school? A relative of someone?)

<b>

Fiorina, being naturally caring,

couldn't just ignore the troubled look on the small child.

Without a moment's hesitation, she stepped off the path and approached the child, speaking to them.

<b>

"Hey there, do you need something at school? Are you here to see someone you know?"

<b>

The boy, with fair skin and a well-proportioned face,

looked to be around ten years old, quite small for his age.

Bending down to meet his eye level, Fiorina spoke to him, and the boy shyly replied.

<b>

"Yeah, I was told to come here. They said to wait inside."

"Is that so? I guess you must be a relative of someone. Hey, did someone tell you to meet them?"

<b>

The boy shook his head, indicating he didn't know.

<b>

"Hmm... what should we do? If we go to the research room, Colin and Bibi will be there... Maybe they can figure out who your relative is?"

<b>

Beatrice was known for having a wide network in the village, despite her appearance.

If she could meet with her, they might find out something.

Fiorina made that judgment and reached out her hand to the boy.

<b>

<b>

"There's no point in staying here, so let's go together. We'll have everyone help find your acquaintance."

<b>

Looking up at the outstretched hand.

<b>

"Can I... go inside?"

"Of course! You can't meet anyone if you don't go inside, right? Come on in!"

"Thank you, big sister!"

<b>

The boy said happily, taking Fiorina's hand and stepping into the school grounds.

<b>

Fiorina noticed that the boy's hand was unusually cold, and her expression tightened for a moment.

But then she realized he was smiling up at her and returned the smile.

<b>

(Maybe he got cold from the wind? The wind from the north feels chilly today...)

<b>

With that thought, she asked the boy.

<b>

"By the way, what's your name? Can you tell me?"

<b>

"Yeah, of course! My name is Doug. I'm called Doug."

Howard's Fury!
