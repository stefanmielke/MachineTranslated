# 21 - Professor Jameson's Magic Course

I am quibbling about it!


----------------

<blank>

At the beginning of the week, a priest from the temple comes to the magic group's study group to give instruction.

<blank>

On the other days, they work on their own assignments and have their results reviewed by the priests.

<blank>

<blank>

I was told that usually a young priest comes and instructs them, but today....

<blank>

Hello Suzy, have you made any friends yet?"

"Mr. Henry...?"

Normally I leave it to the young people here, but today is Susie's first day of school, so I thought I'd check in on her. I just thought I'd check in on her.

<blank>

Henry smiled at me as he said this.

<blank>

'Besides, we had an appointment to continue the lecture, and I know that you need this knowledge if you want to use magic. How about this opportunity?"

Ah... yes... please... do... that...!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the last issue, we talked about the etheric body. This time, I will give you a general explanation of the "emotional body" and "mental body," which are next to the etheric body.

<blank>

<blank>

The "emotional body," also known as the "astral body," is the body of a person's emotions.

The "mental body," also called the "mental body," controls each person's "will.

<blank>

The astral body affects matter for better or worse.

<blank>

The great astral wave interferes with the ether and transforms matter.

The ether that exists throughout the world also has an "emotional body" and a "mental body" on board.

<blank>

The etheric flow in which this "will" rides and creates a large flow is called "mana.

<blank>

The flow of mana over the universe reaches this world and flows to cover the entire world.

We call this stream of mana, this stream of consciousness, the 'Great Spirit Body.

<blank>

The "Great Spirit" is too huge to be captured by human perception, but the "Spirit" that is separated from it and subdivided into smaller entities enables one to communicate with this "flow of mana" for the first time.

<blank>

<blank>

This "spirit body" is further divided into the atmosphere, the earth, and the sea, and the flow with a large amount of mana in it is called the "dragon vein" or "earth vein.

<blank>

Some of the further subdivided manas will have a strong emotional body and individual personality.

<blank>

This is what we recognize as "spirit.

<blank>

<blank>

Spirits are further differentiated by adding attributes of "wind," "water," "earth," and "fire," respectively, and govern the reason for the phenomena of the natural world.

<blank>

<blank>

By contracting with these spirits, we can connect our etheric bodies to each other and exchange information easily.

It is then possible to intervene with etheric information with magical power and alter physical phenomena.

<blank>

This is the basic mechanism for exercising the miracle called magic.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The strength and amount of magical power required to use magic depends on the "emotional body" and "mental body" of the person exercising the magic.

<blank>

<blank>

The "emotional body" is the amount of magic power you have.

The "mental body" is the power to use magic.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, as an analogy, let's imagine a water pistol that is cylindrical and has an extruding rod.

<blank>

The thickness and length of this tube is the size of the "emotional body.

And the force that pushes the stick is the power of the "mental body," or "will.

The amount of water in this water pistol is the amount of magical power a person has.

The amount of water extruded is the amount of magic used.

The force that pushes out is the magical pressure.

<blank>

<blank>

By multiplying the amount of magic used by the magic pressure value, the value of magic energy used, or magic value, can be calculated, but that is a topic for another lecture.

<blank>

<blank>

If emotions are thin, great power cannot be used.

It is impossible to use a stable force if it is easily upset and shaken.

If the emotions are rich, large and stable, greater power can be used.

If your will is weak, you will not be able to use your great strength.

<blank>

Only with a strong will can great power be used strongly.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Mr. Jameson... I have a question..."

Yes, what is it?" What is it, Mr. Suzy? ...Why are you sitting on Mr. Mathieson's lap at this time?"

<blank>

Henry asked me that, and I tried to cover it up by tilting my head and smiling.

<blank>

Now she is held tightly by Mia, her back is supported by her ample bosom and she is sinking down. What's with this depraved sofa? My back is too comfortable, I'm in heaven!

<blank>

Dana and Colin occupied me all lunch, so now it's my turn to cuddle."

<blank>

Mia replied curtly, and Bearko shrugged his shoulders next to her.

Colin, at the edge of the room with his hand over his magic tool, looks over his shoulder and says, "Mhmm.

<blank>

What position am I in to these children?

<blank>

I see...you made a friend early on. That's great...so what's your question?"

<blank>

Mr. Henry asked me again with a happy smile on his face.

<blank>

Yes, how is the water?

The term "water pistol" is a figurative expression; there is nothing to consume when you actually use magic power," he said.

Since it uses one's etheric body as a medium for information, there is a temporary feeling of fatigue, but it is not consumed because it returns to neutral immediately.

The feeling of exhaustion comes from mental fatigue.

The concentration required to use magical power is very difficult. As mental power increases or decreases, the thickness of the emotional body also increases or decreases proportionally. It is safe to say that the strength of mental power is the amount of magical power used.

So if you run out of energy, you won't be able to exercise magic or even stay conscious, and if your energy returns, your usage will also return."

<blank>

<blank>

I see! A subtle sense of exhaustion is mental exhaustion?

It is true that I can sense even the slightest movement of the mind, and even if I am worn out, I will recover in no time.

<blank>

What's that? But maybe I'm going to be bottomless in magic use, right?

I was sweating a little bit.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Still, "Ki" is "consciousness.

The flow of consciousness is the flow of Ki.

Now that we can control the flow and strength of Ki, we can also control the power of magic.

<blank>

Oh, maybe if you put an incredibly strong "Ki" into it and think about it, you can make a fireball or something happen without any spells.

<blank>

<blank>

That can't be true!"

<blank>

When I asked him if he could do such a thing, he was denied by Asari and Bearko.

<blank>

<blank>

The world is not that easy to change things like that! There must be a proper procedure! That is the 'method' and 'technique' of using 'magic'!"

<blank>

Perhaps it is possible with a very large "emotional body," a strong "will," and a strong "imagination. But it is very inefficient. It would only consume your physical and mental strength. It is just like a little child waving his hands around recklessly, letting his strength take over.

As Mr. Kuroki says, if the 'method' is exercised through the correct process, far greater effects can be achieved with much less power."

<blank>

<blank>

So let's make a deal with the genie, shall we?

<blank>

Henry urged me to perform a "covenant ceremony," which I did.

<blank>

First, find out what kind of spirit you are compatible with and then make a 'contract'.

The compatibility is based on what is called a "Gosei-ban" (five spirit board).

<blank>

This is a disk about 30 cm in diameter with a pentagram engraved in the middle and a circular imprint at each of its apexes.

When magic is passed through the middle of this pentagram, the part that controls the compatible spirit will glow.

<blank>

<blank>

Mia and Colin were surprised when I tried to do and see it right away.

<blank>

Normally, you start by feeling and handling magic power, but being able to use this means that you can at least manipulate magic power.

<blank>

This initial training is surprisingly difficult, and it is said that this is what makes them unsuitable for the job.

<blank>

Many of the kids get sick of it at this first and go towards using their bodies. (Dana and Irving seem to be like that...)

<blank>

<blank>

Well, Henry knew that I had restored Howard, so he knew that I could use my magic power.

<blank>

But it seems that Bearco knew about it too.

I heard that the Kuroki family is one of the "Three Families of AMCAM", so I wonder if your father told you about them?

<blank>

Then I put my hand on it and poured magic power into it (like pouring breath from the palm...the same way you pour Ki) and it all lit up.

<blank>

<blank>

Normally, one or two of them would glow, but a pillar of light appeared.

<blank>

Mr. Henry was also surprised...

Hmmm...I thought I poured some of it out.

<blank>

Henry immediately nodded his head in agreement, but the kids around him all froze, their eyes wide open.

<blank>

What is it? Did I do something wrong ......?

<blank>

<blank>

And immediately, Mr. Henry asked me which spirit I wanted to sign up with.

<blank>

I was told that you can contract with all spirits, but why don't you first choose the spirit with the attribute you want? I was told to choose "water".

<blank>

I didn't end up leaving the watering hole at that time, but I shudder to think what would have happened if there had been no water in that situation.

<blank>

So I decided to sign up with "water" as a token of my gratitude.

<blank>

<blank>

The five attributes were "wind/green," "fire/red," "earth/yellow," "water/blue," and "nothing/white.

<blank>

Are we talking about the five elements? It would be really kitchen-ish if we see more "light" and "dark" in this!

<blank>

The "covenant ceremony" began immediately.

On top of the "Go Seiban" that I had just used, I placed a transparent case that looked like it was made of glass or acrylic with five square corners framed by metal, and placed my right palm on top of it.

<blank>

<blank>

Inside the case is a blue light ball (?) is floating, and this is said to be the medium with the spirit of the water attribute.

<blank>

When I put my hand on it, the inside of the case glowed faintly.

In this state, Henry chanted something like a prayer of congratulation, and the pentagram and the metal around the edge of the case glowed, and I could feel the warmth in my palms.

Soon the light went out and Henry told me the ceremony was over.

<blank>

Now my etheric body has a connection with the spirits.

<blank>

<blank>

However, this is not the only way to use magic.

It is said that a key is needed to convey the order to the spirits, be it a spell or a magic spell.

<blank>

Henry handed me a tact-like object and said, "Let's try it out.

<blank>

They say it's a magic wand for practice.

I'm not sure what I'm talking about! It's a Haripotar-like thing!

<blank>

We were led directly to an outdoor place for magic practice.

<blank>

<blank>

There was an archery range-like place, about 20 meters away, where a straw-like object was erected as a target or something like that.

<blank>

Since this is a place used for testing and practicing firepower magic, it is said to be sturdily built so that it will not break down in the slightest.

<blank>

I'm assuming that the children's strength will be ......," Henry told me, and I froze for a moment, sweat pouring down my back!

<blank>

<blank>

The spells I was taught...or rather, the "blessings"...were simple.

<blank>

Susie Cloud, the covenant maker, made her appeal. She said in faltering tones, "Guardian of the waters, answer my request and show me your power.

<blank>

<blank>

In other words, it seems that we should tell them what we are looking for, where and to whom.

<blank>

The spells were fine, but it was how to apply the magic that was nerve-wracking! I tried to thread it slowly and carefully, like threading a needle through a hole in a needle, but I only put a drop of magic into the tact...

<blank>

There is a mass of water the size of a light car floating in front of me....

<blank>

What is it? What do we do now?　Henry was nodding his head in admiration, and Mia, Colin, and Behrko's mouths were hanging open.

<blank>

No, you can't! The girls think that's hashtanai!

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you. What kind of spirit would you normally ask for? What kind of person am I in relation to that? I heard that you have to be very precise about these things to get a great result.

<blank>

Since we are going to study and learn about this, this was just a trial run and was very rough, so even if we got a ball of water, it would only be a ping-pong ball at best! That's what they were trying to say...

<blank>

Anta! How much stupid magic do you have!"

<blank>

I was greatly dismayed by Bearko.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I think I've learned more about you in one day than I've ever heard in my life!

What? That's... a big... big... big... deal! Yes?

Why do you end with a question, Sue?"

<blank>

For some reason, after the first day of school, I was chatting with everyone outside the school building, chatting away like a housewife at a housewife's well-wishing party.

<blank>

I've never seen anyone who could suddenly produce water that big.

I'm sad that I'm the only one left out, Sue! Come over here soon!

Dana, you should spend a little time meditating, too, okay?"

I'm not good at it. When I sit still, my butt gets restless!"

Irving said something similar!"

"Peace... is... the... essence... of... protecting... the...

Ugh! Seriously! ...My dad says that a lot..."

Dana falls asleep so easily."

<blank>

<blank>

I feel a presence approaching me when I talk about it. ...... You're after something again, aren't you?

<blank>

I can tell that the approaching sign is Stefan's...well, it's just a kid's prank, so I'll tolerate it leniently. ......

I was just looking at her and trying to see what was going on. ...... but then her skirt was lifted up from behind and my little ass was exposed in its entirety!

My lovely hips!

<blank>

"Whoooaaa...!"

<blank>

Ugh, it's a bit of a surprise to have my butt exposed in the back where I can't see it! I made a funny noise!

<blank>

So, but what is this? Am I feeling more embarrassed than I thought I was...? Is this what you call "maiden's shyness"? When did I grow up to have a girlish mind of my own?

<blank>

I'm so glad you're here! Stefan again! Damn! I knew he was fast!

Oh my, she's totally taken a liking to you."

Sue, you can't just stay here and take it out on me! Don't let him get to you! Men are so easily provoked!

Yes, boys think naughty thoughts and you have to be careful, Sue, okay?

<blank>

Well, it can't be helped with Mia, can it?

That depraved meat is too much stimulation for those adolescent boys, don't you think?

<blank>

Ech... of...?"

<blank>

And I looked behind me as I brushed the butt of my skirt...and my eyes met Irving's.

<blank>

You see? You're looking at me like that!"

<blank>

And Irving is saying "Ugh!" when Bearko gives him a cold look.

<blank>

"Irving... is he... too... edgy?"

<blank>

I tilted my head and asked him, and Irving was blushing and shaking his head furiously.

<blank>

"Oh, ......! Stefan! What the hell did you do, you son of a bitch! Wait!

<blank>

He shouted, and then made a mad dash for Stefan, who was far away.

<blank>

You got away."

You got away.

You got away.

Hmph!"

But, Sue, can't you avoid something like that? Couldn't you even catch her?"

"Really? You can't be... a freak!"

Chi! Chi! I'm not going to......! ...exposure...today...no...! ...children... to... do... a... lot... of... things... to... look... out... for... ...hand...

'Oh, you really can avoid it... 'tolerate' ...... hey? How about that?"

What?

That's right! It's a criminal act, you know! It's for his own good to scold him properly."

I don't want them to grow up and become weird adults."

I understand... I understand... the next... thing... is... to... do... that... thing... that... you... do... that... thing... that... you... do.

I don't know if you're a smart girl or a smart girl!

"Ugh... out... of... it?"

<blank>

All four nodded in unison.
