# Chapter 21: Professor Jameson's Magic Course

I'm spinning some ridiculous reasoning! lol

----------------

<b>

In the magic group’s study session, at the beginning of the week, a priest comes from the temple to provide guidance.

<b>

On other days, everyone focuses on their respective assignments and repeats a rotation where they show their results to the priest again.

<b>

<b>

Usually, a young priest comes to provide guidance, but today…

<b>

“Hello, Suzy! Have you made any friends yet?”

“Henry…?”

“I usually leave it to the younger ones here, but since today is your first day at school, I couldn’t help but come to check on you.”

<b>

Saying that, Henry smiled at me.

<b>

“And, we had a promise to continue the lecture, and it’s necessary knowledge for using magic. How about taking this opportunity?”

“Ah… yes… please…!”

<b>

<b>

<b>

Last time, we talked about the etheric body. This time, I will give a general explanation about the next bodies: the “emotional body” and the “mental body.”

<b>

<b>

The “emotional body” is also called the “astral body” and governs a person's “emotions.”

The “mental body” is also called the “mental body” and governs a person's “will.”

<b>

The astral body influences the physical world, both positively and negatively.

<b>

Large astral waves interfere with the ether and can change matter.

The ether, which exists everywhere in the world, is also influenced by the “emotional body” and the “mental body.”

<b>

This “will” rides on the ether flow created by large currents, which we call “mana.”

<b>

The flow of mana that envelops the universe reaches this world and flows in a way that covers the entire world.

We refer to this flow of mana, this flow of consciousness, as the “Great Spirit Body.”

<b>

The “Great Spirit Body” is too vast for human perception to grasp, but from it, the separate and subdivided “spirit bodies” allow humans to first connect with this “flow of mana.”

<b>

<b>

This “spirit body” further divides into finer aspects within the atmosphere, the earth, and the sea, but among these, the flows with a thick and abundant amount of mana are called “dragon veins” and “earth veins.”

<b>

Furthermore, some of the subdivided mana manifests strongly as the emotional body, showing individual characteristics.

<b>

This is what we recognize as “spirits.”

<b>

<b>

Spirits further differentiate, some as “wind,” some as “water,” some as “earth,” and some as “fire,” each acquiring attributes and governing the principles of natural phenomena.

<b>

<b>

By contracting with these spirits, we connect our etheric bodies and can easily exchange information.

Then, by intervening in etheric information with magical power, it becomes possible to change physical phenomena.

<b>

This is the basic mechanism for exercising the miracles called magic.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The strength and amount of magical power required to use magic depend on the two aspects of the person exercising it: the “emotional body” and the “mental body.”

<b>

<b>

The “emotional body” determines the size of one’s magical power.

The “mental body” is the force required to use magical power.

<b>

<b>

For example, let’s imagine a water gun with a cylindrical shape and a plunger.

<b>

The thickness and length of this cylinder represent the size of the “emotional body.”

And the force pushing the plunger represents the “mental body,” or “will.”

The amount of water inside this water gun represents the size of that person’s magical power.

The amount of water expelled represents the amount of magic used.

The force of expulsion represents the magical pressure.

<b>

<b>

By multiplying the values of the amount of magic used and the magical pressure, we can calculate the value of the magical energy used, or the magical value, but that’s a topic for another lecture.

<b>

<b>

If emotions are weak, one cannot use great power.

If emotions fluctuate easily and are unstable, one cannot use stable power.

If emotions are rich, large, and stable, one can use greater power.

If the will is weak, even great power cannot be utilized.

<b>

Only with a strong will can one use great power strongly.

“Professor Jameson… I have a question…”

“Yes, what is it, Suzy? …By the way, why are you sitting on Mathison’s lap?”

<b>

When Henry asked me that, I tilted my head and smiled to deflect.

<b>

Right now, I was being held tightly by Mia, my back sinking into her ample chest. What is this decadent sofa? This heavenly back support is too comfortable—!?

<b>

“I was occupied by Dana and Colin during lunch, so now it’s my turn to hold you.”

<b>

Mia answered nonchalantly, and Bearko shrugged her shoulders with a “what a hassle” expression.

Colin, who was at the edge of the room, had a “hmm” look on his face as he placed his hand on a magical tool.

<b>

What position do I hold for these kids, anyway?

<b>

“I see… So you’ve already made some friends. That’s great… Now, what is your question?”

<b>

Henry asked again with a pleased smile.

<b>

“Yes, um… how does… the water… return…?”

“The water gun is a metaphor; in reality, nothing is consumed when using magical power.

You use your own etheric body as a medium for information, so there is a temporary feeling of fatigue, but it quickly returns to neutral, meaning nothing is consumed.

The feeling of depletion comes from mental fatigue.

The concentration required to use magical power is quite significant. The thickness of the emotional body also increases or decreases in proportion to the changes in mental strength. The strength of mental power can be said to correspond to the amount of magical power used.

Therefore, if you exhaust your mental energy, you won’t be able to exercise magic, let alone maintain consciousness, and when your mental energy returns, so does the amount used.”

<b>

<b>

I see! That subtle feeling of depletion is due to mental fatigue.

Indeed, right now, I can sensitively perceive even the slightest movement of my mind, and recovery is almost instantaneous.

<b>

Wait? But could it be that I might have an endless supply of magical usage?

…A bead of sweat trickled down.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Even so, “ki” refers to “consciousness.”

The “flow of consciousness” is indeed the “flow of ki.”

Now that I can control the flow and strength of “ki,” it means I can also control the power of magic.

<b>

Ah, could it be that if I concentrate an incredibly strong “ki” and focus, I could create a fireball without any incantation?

<b>

<b>

“There's no way that’s possible!”

<b>

When I asked if that could be done, Bearko flatly denied it.

<b>

<b>

“The world isn’t so easy that you can change phenomena that easily! Proper procedures are necessary! That is the ‘method’ and ‘technique’ for using ‘magical power!’”

<b>

“Perhaps that would be possible with a very large ‘emotional body,’ a strong ‘will,’ and a powerful ‘imagination.’ However, that would be extremely inefficient. It would just waste physical and mental energy. It’s the same as a child recklessly swinging their arms without purpose.

As you said, if the ‘method’ is exercised through the correct process, you can achieve far greater effects with much less power.”

<b>

<b>

Shall we try to contract with a spirit?

<b>

Encouraged by Henry, I was about to perform something called the “contract ritual.”

<b>

First, we would investigate which spirits are compatible before proceeding with the “contract.”

Compatibility is determined using something called the “Five Spirit Plate.”

<b>

This is a disk about 30 centimeters in diameter, with a pentagram engraved in the center, and round engravings at each vertex.

When magical power is channeled into the center of this pentagram, the part governing the compatible spirit glows.

<b>

<b>

As I was about to try it, Mia and Colin looked surprised.

<b>

Normally, one would start by sensing and handling magical power, but being able to use this means that at least I can manipulate magical power.

<b>

This initial training is surprisingly tough, and it seems that it determines one’s suitability.

Many children end up disliking this initial step and gravitate towards physical activities instead. (It seems Dana and Irvin are like that…)

<b>

<b>

Well, Henry knew that I had healed Howard, so he understood that I could use magical power.

<b>

But Bearko seemed to know too.

The Kuroki family is one of the “Amukam Three Families,” so perhaps she heard it from her father?

<b>

So, when I placed my hand and channeled my magical power (like blowing breath from my palm… the same principle as channeling “ki”), everything lit up.

<b>

<b>

Normally, only one or two parts are supposed to glow, but a pillar of light stood up.

<b>

Henry seemed surprised…

Hmm, I thought I had only channeled a little.

<b>

Henry nodded as if he understood immediately, but the other kids were all wide-eyed and frozen.

<b>

Huh? Did I… do something?

<b>

Then, Henry immediately asked me which spirit I would contract with.

<b>

It seems I can contract with all spirits, but he suggested I choose a spirit of the attribute I desire first, so I went with “water.”

<b>

I thought about how essential water was during our survival life, and I shuddered at the thought of what would have happened if we hadn’t had water back then.

<b>

So, I decided to express my gratitude to “water” and contract with it.

<b>

<b>

The five attributes were “wind/green,” “fire/red,” “earth/yellow,” “water/blue,” and “void/white.”

<b>

Could it be the five great elements? If “light” and “darkness” come into play, it would be quite cliché!

<b>

The “contract ritual” began immediately.

On top of the “Five Spirit Plate” I just used, a transparent case made of glass or acrylic, edged with metal, shaped like a pentagon was placed, and I put my right palm on top of it.

<b>

<b>

Inside the case floated a blue light sphere (?), which would serve as the medium for the water attribute spirit.

<b>

As I placed my hand on it, the inside of the case began to glow faintly.

While in that state, Henry recited something resembling a blessing, and the pentagram and the metal edges of the case emitted light, and I felt warmth in my palm.

Before long, the light faded, and Henry told me the ritual was complete.

<b>

With this, a connection with the spirit was established in my etheric body.

<b>

<b>

However, this alone doesn’t mean I can use magic; I need a technique to do so.

That involves incantations or magic circles, which are keys to convey orders to the spirits.

<b>

Shall we try using it now? Henry handed me something resembling a wand.

<b>

It was a practice magic wand.

Oh! This is like something out of Harry Potter!!

<b>

I was then guided to an outdoor area for magic practice.

<b>

<b>

It looked like an archery range, with something resembling rolled straw set up about 20 meters ahead as a target.

<b>

This place is used for testing and practicing powerful magic, so it’s built sturdy enough not to break easily.

<b>

Though that’s based on the assumption of children’s strength… Henry whispered to me, and I felt a trickle of sweat down my back, freezing a bit!

<b>

<b>

The incantation I learned… or rather, the “blessing”… was simple.

<b>

“Suzy Cloud, the contractor, calls upon you. Guardian of water, respond to my request and show your power.” I clumsily articulated.

<b>

<b>

In other words, it seems I just need to convey who I am, who I’m addressing, and what I’m asking for.

<b>

The incantation was fine, but what took concentration was channeling the magical power! Like threading a needle, I carefully and slowly channeled just a single drop into the wand…

<b>

And somehow, a mass of water the size of a small car floated in front of me…

<b>

Huh? What should I do? When I turned around, Henry was nodding in admiration, while Mia, Colin, and Bearko had their mouths agape.

<b>

No! It’s inappropriate for a girl to be like that!!

<b>

<b>

It seems that normally, one needs to specify which spirit they are asking for and clarify their position regarding it; otherwise, significant results won’t occur.

<b>

I was told that this was a rough trial, and since I was just experimenting, it was expected that even a small water sphere the size of a ping pong ball would be a great success!

<b>

“How absurdly powerful is your magical power!?”

<b>

Bearko exclaimed in disbelief.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“I feel like I’ve realized how much of an outlier you are compared to what I’ve heard today!”

“Wha!? …That’s… a big… misunderstanding… I think…?”

“Why did you end with a question?”

<b>

After finishing my first day at school, I found myself outside the school building, engaging in trivial chatter with everyone, much like a housewife’s gossip.

<b>

“Seriously, I’ve never seen someone who can produce such a large amount of water so suddenly.”

“I feel lonely being left out, Su! Come over here quickly!”

“Dana, you should also spend some time meditating!”

“Ugh… I’m not good at that. When I sit still, my butt gets restless!”

“Irvine said something similar!”

“Staying calm… is… important…”

“Ugh! Really!? …My dad often tells me that…”

“You fall asleep so easily, Dana.”

<b>

<b>

As we were chatting, I sensed someone approaching me. …They’re up to something again?

<b>

Later, I realized the presence approaching was Stefan’s… well, it’s just a child’s prank, so I’ll let it slide…

I kept observing, but suddenly, my skirt was lifted from behind, exposing my small bottom completely!!

My cute little hips are being exposed!!!

<b>

“Ugh…!”

<b>

Having my bottom bared where I couldn’t see was quite a shock! I couldn’t help but let out a strange sound!

<b>

But what is this? Am I feeling more embarrassed than I expected? Is this what they call a maiden’s modesty?! When did I start nurturing a girl’s heart within me?! 

<b>

“Damn it! Stefan!! Tch! He’s really fast at running away!!”

“Oh my, it seems that child has taken quite a liking to you.”

“Su! Don’t just let it happen; you should get mad! Boys get carried away easily!!”

“That’s right; boys think of lewd things right away… Su, you need to be careful; it’s not good!”

<b>

Well, I can’t help it with Mia, can I?

That decadent figure is too stimulating for the adolescent boys, isn’t it?

<b>

“Lewd…?”

<b>

As I patted my skirt and looked back… I met Irvin’s gaze.

<b>

“See! He’s looking at you with those lewd eyes!”

<b>

Bearko shot a cold glare at Irvin, who was saying “ugh.”

<b>

“Irvine… is… lewd… too…?”

<b>

When I tilted my head and asked, Irvin shook his head vigorously, turning red.

<b>

“Ah…! Stefan!! What the hell did you do, you brat!! Wait!!!”

<b>

I shouted and dashed towards Stefan, who was far away.

<b>

“He ran away.”

“He did run away.”

“He’s gone.”

“Hmph!”

“But, Su, couldn’t you have avoided that? You could catch him, right?”

“Is that so!? Are you saying… I’m an exhibitionist!?”

“W-wait! I’m not! …I’m not an exhibitionist!! …Is it okay for kids… to do things like that…?”

“Oh, so you really could avoid it… ‘a lot’… huh? I’m not so sure about that.”

“...I understand… I’ll scold him… next time!”

“You’re a bit hard to read; I can’t tell if you’re absent-minded or reliable!”

“Ugh… am I absent-minded?”

<b>

All four of them nodded in agreement.
