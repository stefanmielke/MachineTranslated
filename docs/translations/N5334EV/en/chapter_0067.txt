# 62 The Sorrows of Sonia Cloud

Thank you very much for your patience!

It has been more than two months since the last update.

<blank>

This is the last update in the Heisei period.

This will be the fifth episode in a row. Thank you again for your patience.

Mr. Fourier! Do I really have to accompany you?"

<blank>

After the meeting with the Amcam side, in one of the lounges addressed to the delegation, Connor Clark expressed his concerns to Cameron Houllier.

<blank>

What's the matter now, Mr. Clark? We agreed on that when we left for King's Landing.

"...but...but...but...but...but...but...but...! In such an uncivilized land... oh, such a... oh, such a barbaric race of people!

<blank>

Clark remembered. The exchange he had just had. The swarthy look in the eyes of the man who called himself Silence Kuroki. And the high spirits of Howard Cloud, the current head of AMCAM, who said he would go with him to the Great Forest of Iroshio.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Conor Clark is a civilian by nature. He has never been involved in anything rough, and has lived his life to this day.

<blank>

What brought Clark to such a remote area?

The main reason is that Fourier, his immediate superior, has become the representative of the survey mission, but that is not the only reason for him.

<blank>

To be honest, Clark had no intention of going to Ilocio with them at the beginning.

<blank>

The Irosio Great Forest is a frontier full of magical beasts that I have only heard stories about.

For Clark, who has rarely left King's Landing, it is truly uncharted territory.

It was a matter of time before Clark thought about going to such a place.

<blank>

However, Cameron Houllier offered Clark enough to get him to agree to go to the frontier.

It is the rich network of contacts that Fourier has.

<blank>

Fourier himself is of aristocratic descent, albeit from a side line. He is a descendant of the famous Valdemonte family, which has left its mark on history.

<blank>

Houlihan has formed various connections through the power of his bloodline.

Some are associated with royal families. Others are directors of corporations that have a continental reach. Still others are high-ranking officials of temple governments.

Clark knew that Fourier, who was by no means highly capable, was in his current key position because of such backing.

<blank>

He came to me and said that if such a fourier would accompany the delegation, I could introduce him to certain people.

He also said he would prepare a letter of recommendation for promotion to a more responsible position....

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Conor Clark is a self-described careerist.

<blank>

I am a brilliant person, so it is only natural that I should rise higher and faster than any of my peers.

He is quick-witted, always chooses the best solution, and can use people accurately and efficiently.

All I need is a solid pipe, and as long as I use it well, I can go anywhere I want to go.

That is the feeling that Conor Clark has always had.

<blank>

For Clark, Fourier's invitation was an attractive proposition.

<blank>

The group that will travel with him to Irosio is the Mobile Heavy Knights, an elite group of knights skilled in exterminating monsters, beasts, and other non-human creatures.

There is no such thing as a more powerful force in this country than the Knights.

This time, he says, that battalion will be the main force of the Irosio survey team.

<blank>

Couldn't have asked for a more reliable escort?"

<blank>

Fourier told Clark.

<blank>

We didn't have to traverse the Iroquois Forest," he said. What is important is the fact that a survey team was sent.

<blank>

This is the greatest cataclysm in the history of the world. The country cannot afford to do nothing.

That said, it would be impossible for humans to venture as far as the Deipala Mountains.

Still, the fact that they sent a survey team to Ilocio and set foot in the area is a political necessity, Fourier said.

<blank>

We will ask for the help of the Amkham Protectorate as our guide. We will ask for the help of the Amkham Protectorate as our guides, and our reputation will be enhanced by having a well-known name with us. You will be escorted by them and the Knights to explore the forest for three or four days. It would be a simple six-month round-trip business trip, right? And then you'll be promoted."

<blank>

It was quite natural for Clark to agree to Fourier's proposal.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

But Clark was now beginning to think the story was different.

<blank>

To Clark, who had lived a life free from the rough and tumble, the presence of the people of Amkam seemed no different from that of an unsocial group.

<blank>

The journey to arrive here was indeed safe and comfortable, protected by the Knights.

There is no one who would dare to oppose Fourier, as a matter of course.

On my journey, I had the opportunity to enjoy many tasty treats from Fourier's.

In the carriages, they would do whatever they wanted in the daytime, taking advantage of the fact that they could not be seen from the outside.

<blank>

This is not surprising, since there are Fouriers of aristocratic stripes.

It is natural for those in the center to value bloodlines.

<blank>

But what about those here?

He professes that no one pays respect to his bloodline.

<blank>

I had heard stories that the further one went into the countryside, the less respect one had for one's lineage, but this was the first time I had witnessed it.

<blank>

Clark was beginning to feel somewhat agitated.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Well, I know what you mean. But you're also lucky.

What about...? Luck...? Am I...?"

Yes, it's you! Think about it! Sir Cloud is essentially the Earl of Amscombe, and you're going to be pioneering the frontier with him! You're going to be pioneering the frontier with him! What an honor!

<blank>

<blank>

Houllier invited Clark to become deputy of the mission because the man is easy to handle.

<blank>

It is funny to see them always wanting to be judged as low as possible, but if you give them something to feed on, they will listen to anything you say.

The thinking is really easy to understand.

<blank>

I am obligated to remain in the safe rear and oversee the movement of the entire survey team.

Who would go to the front lines where there are dangers?

<blank>

I need Clark to go to the front line to replace me.

That's why I brought him here.

I gave him a much tastier look on the road.

You will work hard for what you give.

<blank>

It is not acceptable for them to roll over on their asses now. If he runs away, he will be completely off the career track.

They would not be able to return safely to the royal capital.

<blank>

Even though Clark has only one choice from the beginning, I am a very kind and generous person for trying to persuade him to take it.

<blank>

Houllier was pleased with his thoughts and went on to spin out his words to persuade Clark.

<blank>

<blank>

"........."

How much better will that fact make the people around you feel when you get back to the center? ...Imagine that?"

...is ......mu"

I can't imagine how well you will be received by the people you introduce to us on your triumphant return to King's Landing. I can only imagine how well you will be received by the people I introduce to you upon our triumphant return to King's Landing.

<blank>

<blank>

They say that the grader will be back in a week, but it will take another week or two to get everything ready again.

Stranded here for almost a month is no joke.

If expenses are unnecessarily high, one's reputation will suffer.

And we don't even know how prestigious the returning grader will be.

I can't take that kind of gamble.

It is advisable to have them leave as soon as possible.

<blank>

In fact, he was willing to stand up for us. There is no such a good deal to be had.

If I had let Sir to leave, there is no doubt that my own reputation would be maximized.

I can't stand being stiffed by Clark's selfishness, etc.

We must have them go there at all costs.

<blank>

Houllier continues to persuade Clark with a lump in his stomach.

<blank>

<blank>

Mm... mm, ......."

<blank>

You don't have to go all the way to Irosio to start, and you don't have to go all the way back! You don't have to go all the way to Irosio! You just have to make sure the base camp you're building is complete three or four days down the road, and then you can come back with a supply convoy...and that's only four or five days away. ...We're only talking about four or five days."

...yes, it was...no, it was!"

<blank>

No need to worry, Mr. Clark! All you have to do is think of the glory that is promised to you."

If so, then I'll do what I promised! Then, as promised! If the expedition is successful, I would be grateful if you could introduce me to all of you!"

<blank>

"Yes, I'll take care of it! I'll leave you to it!"

<blank>

Even before the sun had reached its peak, the thin laughter of lowly men echoed quietly in the dimly lit room.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmph! I don't like these people!"

<blank>

After the meeting with the delegation representatives ended, Howard and the heads of the three families went to the council meeting room.

As soon as Silence sat down in his chair, he spewed venom at the opening of his speech.

<blank>

Don't say that, Silence. He's just a man who's honest about his own ambition.

It's like the saying goes, Your Highness. He is just an egomaniac who will stop at nothing to achieve his ambition.

<blank>

Howard cowered his shoulders at Alphonse's disgusted words.

<blank>

"Well, I'm sure you know a little bit about gut feeling, don't you? Just as you do."

<blank>

As Howard said this, he squinted happily at Silence and Alphonse.

Silence and Alphonse turn away to see what he is talking about.

<blank>

It was quite amusing to watch them play their mutually assigned roles of agitator and appeaser. It was quite amusing to watch them play their mutually determined roles.

He turned it upside down. The head of the church is a very bad person..."

<blank>

Alphonse sighed in dismay again.

<blank>

AnnaMarie had already told me about his character..."

The Bairos family's intelligence network, isn't it? If the two men who came out of the carriage yesterday are also...?"

"Well, I gave them a hard time..."

<blank>

Howard nodded in response to August's question and affirmed that the women who had shared the carriage with Fourier and the others yesterday were related to Amkam.

<blank>

He is always concerned only with how high he can be held in esteem.

"So you're as nasty as you look!"

<blank>

Silence spits it out.

<blank>

But he is just a good-natured guy who is loyal to the bait in front of him. It is better to lend him a favor than to leave him with a bad situation.

<blank>

But that doesn't mean that He will be there! One of us will be enough!"

<blank>

I'm a much bigger bait for him than a couple of Grade A's. He'll be able to use me. There's no bigger bait for him than me. Besides, August...I told you before. You three families are not allowed to leave the village for long periods of time.

<blank>

They don't know! What does it mean to challenge the depths of Irosio? ...... Even a child in this village knows what can happen with the slightest carelessness! They don't understand that at all!

We're supposed to be the ones to guide them.

So I hope one of us will go..."

August! You are the reason for AMCAM... we can't afford to have any surprises. You are not 'ornaments' like me.

There is no one to take the place of your head!

Relax, Augusto.

<blank>

Silence admonishes August from his side, tapping him on the chest with his lightly clasped left hand.

August gulped once and regained his elevated breathing.

<blank>

Besides, now I have her.... We have someone we can trust with our lives. Don't you think we can take on this challenge without any worries?"

"Your head."

"As a man born in Amkham, isn't it only natural that he would want to challenge the abyss?"

<blank>

<blank>

Since ancient times, the people of Amkam have sustained themselves by clearing the heavily eroding Iroshio Forest.

For those living in Amkham, there was nothing more honorable than to go deeper into the abyss of the Great Forest.

At the same time, however, it also means that there is little hope of returning home alive.

<blank>

Live in the forest, return to the forest," August recalled the old saying.

<blank>

Long ago, when the people living in Amkam were still having a hard time living.

A time when children were weighed in the scales of life and death in the forest.

These were the words of a time when not only children but also the old entrusted their fate to the forest.

<blank>

These are not the times we live in anymore.

But Howard is trying to tell us that he is looking for a place to die deep in the woods.

<blank>

<blank>

Augusto looked up to see Silence glaring behind Howard, Alphonse glaring behind Howard... and the portrait of the first Lord of Amkham, Geoloa Amkham.

<blank>

The three of them turn their attention to the words inscribed on its majestic frame.

<blank>

Those who pioneer and advance in Ilocio, step on its soil with undaunted determination.

<blank>

August gasps. Alphonse and Silence also stopped moving.

<blank>

And besides... this is my last chance to enter the depths of Irosio!

Your Highness... you are...

There's... there's something in there that needs to be returned.

<blank>

Howard speaks quietly in front of the three of them.

<blank>

There's ......, Loran is waiting for you!"

<blank>

Howard's eyes speak of a man's flame that smolders to the end.

The unquenchable flame that kept lighting deep in my heart.

The torrent that I have been craving for, the male spirit that will never be crushed.

<blank>

<blank>

We had dinner that night in the hall of the Amcam House with Howard Papa and Sonia Mama.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The village is in a state of unprecedented chaos and excitement.

The knights have arrived and work at the town hall is said to be in disarray.

<blank>

The three families are now staying and working at such Amcam House, including August, the village head, and others.

<blank>

Therefore, meals are often shared with everyone.

Especially dinner is taken together since everyone is also exchanging information.

Often, Molly, the wife of the Beers family, and Jane, the wife of the Kroki family, came and joined us.

<blank>

Last night, for example, the Kuroki family was there with their family, so Bibi and his brother Ed had dinner with them.

It's kind of fun to eat with such a large group of people.

<blank>

<blank>

But tonight, Papa Howard said he would like to dine with just the three of us.

<blank>

As we ate, I told them about what had happened that day.

<blank>

The equipment of the Knights was so shocking that I couldn't help but talk about it....

They seemed to enjoy listening to us from start to finish.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Later, over after-dinner tea, Howard said he had something he wanted to talk to Sonia's mother and me about.

<blank>

Elrose and AnnaMarie prepared the tea.

<blank>

As Elrose looks on, AnnaMarie dances the tea leaves in the pot and carefully pours the tea.

<blank>

Enjoying the rising aroma, the three of us enjoyed the tea quietly for a while without speaking a word.

I feel a graceful yet profound flow of willpower from Howard Papa as he takes his tea, as if he has set his heart on it.

<blank>

Perhaps sensing this, Sonia Mama was quiet, but her heart was deep and soft.

It is as if they are trying to catch everything that is coming.

<blank>

I have decided to go to ...... to search for Irosio."

<blank>

Slowly, Dad cut him off.

Sonia Mama's hand, which was bringing the tea to her mouth, stops.

<blank>

Howard..."

"This is probably... the last time..."

<blank>

"........."

"Three days later, on the 29th, I will set out."

<blank>

As if to say something, Sonia Mama's hand gripped the sky as she set down her teacup and placed both hands quietly in her lap as if to reconsider.

<blank>

Tomorrow, I'll go home and get everything ready. Susie, will you help me?"

Uh... yes.

<blank>

I felt a pain in my heart as I seemed to be able to see what was going on inside Sonia's chest as she spoke with her eyes downcast.

<blank>

Oh, um! Howard Dad...!"

Suzy, I asked you to take care of the village..." You promised me, didn't you?"

<blank>

Uh... yes.

Take care of the village... and Sonia. I promise."

<blank>

He looked into my eyes as if he was asking me for a favor, with his eyes very gentle and soft, while keeping his determination deep in his heart.

<blank>

Oh... Howard, Dad... Sonia, Mom!

<blank>

I laid my own hand on the hand of Sonia's mother sitting next to mine, stared quietly into her face as she stared at the teacups from the side, and then gently squeezed her slightly cold hand.

Sonia-mama squeezed my hand back tightly.

Next "The Rise of the Knights of Aurora"

<blank>

I said I would put it in properly, but I don't have a postcard SS!

I'm sorryーー! <m(__)m>

<blank>

It may be added in time, but we are not sure!
