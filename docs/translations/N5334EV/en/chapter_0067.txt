"Lord Fourier! Must I truly accompany you?"

<b>

After the meeting with the Amkam side, Connor Clark expressed his anxiety to Cameron Fourier in a corner lounge assigned to the delegation.

<b>

"Clark, what's wrong now? Didn't we decide that when we departed from the royal capital?"

"…B-but! To act alongside such… such barbaric races in this uncivilized land!!"

<b>

Clark recalled the earlier exchange. The menacing gaze of the man who called himself Silence Croki. And the ambition of Howard Cloud, the current leader of Amkam, who proposed to go to the Great Iloshio Forest together.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

Connor Clark was a pure bureaucrat. He had lived his life completely unacquainted with rough affairs.

<b>

As for why Clark had come all the way to this remote region...

The main reason was that his direct superior, Fourier, had become the representative of the survey mission, but for him, that wasn’t the only factor.

<b>

To be honest, Clark had no intention of going to Iloshio at first.

<b>

The Great Iloshio Forest was a frontier teeming with magical beasts that he had only heard about in stories.

For someone like Clark, who had hardly ever left the royal capital, it was truly an unknown territory.

The thought of going to such a place was out of the question for him.

<b>

However, Cameron Fourier had offered Clark a reward sufficient to persuade him to accept the expedition to the frontier.

That was Fourier's rich network of connections.

<b>

Fourier himself, though a branch of nobility, was of noble blood. He was related to the historic Baldermonte family.

<b>

Using the power of that bloodline, Fourier had formed various connections.

Some were connected to the royal family, others were directors of companies that spanned the entire continent, and still others were high-ranking officials of the temple.

Clark knew that Fourier, who could not be said to be particularly capable, held his current important position because of such backing.

<b>

Fourier had said that if he accompanied the delegation, he could introduce Clark to certain individuals.

Moreover, he mentioned that he would prepare a letter of recommendation for a promotion to a responsible position…

<b>

<b>

<b>

Connor Clark was a person who was recognized by himself and others for his strong ambition for advancement.

<b>

Since he was an excellent person, it was only natural for him to rise faster and higher than anyone else in his cohort.

He was quick-witted, always choosing the optimal solution, and could use people effectively and efficiently.

All he needed was a solid connection; if he used it well, he could rise as far as he wanted.

That was the thought that Connor Clark always held.

<b>

For someone like Clark, Fourier's invitation was an attractive proposal.

<b>

The ones accompanying him to Iloshio were the elite of the mobile heavy cavalry, a knight order skilled at exterminating magical beasts and other non-human threats.

In this country, there could be no greater military force than a knight order.

This time, that battalion would serve as the main fighting force of the Iloshio investigation team.

<b>

"Don't you think there's no more reliable escort than this?"

<b>

Fourier spoke to Clark.

<b>

"There’s no need to traverse the Great Iloshio Forest. What’s important is the fact that the investigation team has been dispatched."

<b>

It was a great upheaval in recorded history. The country could not remain inactive.

However, stepping into the Deipara Mountain Range was utterly impossible for humanity.

Even so, the political necessity was to send an investigation team to Iloshio and establish the fact that they had set foot there, Fourier explained.

<b>

"We will seek the cooperation of the Amkam Civil Guard as guides on-site. If we bring out well-known individuals, our evaluation will rise. You just need to be escorted by them and the knight order and explore the forest for about 3 to 4 days. Think of it as a business trip that takes a little over half a year for a round trip; it should be an easy task, right? And then you will be promoted."

<b>

It was only natural for Clark to accept Fourier's proposal.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

However, Clark was beginning to think that the situation was different now.

<b>

For someone who had lived a life completely unacquainted with rough affairs, the aura emitted by the people of Amkam seemed no different from that of an antisocial group.

<b>

The journey to this point had been very safe and comfortable, protected by the knight order.

Naturally, there was no one who opposed Fourier.

Along the way, he had enjoyed quite a few delicious experiences thanks to Fourier's generosity.

In the carriage, he had taken advantage of the fact that they were not visible from the outside to do as he pleased during the day.

<b>

This was only natural because Fourier was of noble descent.

It was a matter of course for those in the center to value their bloodline.

<b>

But what about the people here?

They openly declared that there was no one who respected bloodlines.

<b>

He had heard that respect for bloodlines diminishes the further one goes into the countryside, but this was the first time he had witnessed it firsthand.

<b>

Clark was beginning to feel somewhat unsettled.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Well, I understand what you want to say. But you could also say that you are lucky."

"…Huh? Lucky…? Me?"

"That's right, you! Just think about it! Lord Cloud is originally a person who holds the title of Baron of Amkam! You will be opening up uncivilized lands together with that person! What an honor it is?!"

<b>

<b>

Fourier invited Clark to be the deputy of the delegation because this man was easy to handle.

<b>

His low self-evaluation and constant desire for recognition that exceeded his abilities seemed ridiculous from the outside, but if you gave him something to latch onto, he would listen to you as much as you wanted.

His thinking was very straightforward.

<b>

He would remain safely in the rear and have the duty to supervise the movements of the entire investigation team.

Who would willingly go to the dangerous front lines?

<b>

It was necessary for Clark to go in his place at the front lines.

That was why he had brought him along.

Along the way, he had made sure to give him quite a few enjoyable experiences.

What he had given must be repaid with hard work.

<b>

It was unacceptable to back out now. If he ran away, he would be completely off the path to advancement.

He would likely not be able to return safely to the royal capital.

<b>

Despite the fact that Clark had only one option to choose from from the beginning, he felt that it was quite kind of him to persuade him like this.

<b>

While reveling in such thoughts, Fourier continued to weave words to persuade Clark.

<b>

<b>

"………"

"How much good impression will that fact give you when you return to the center?!… Can you imagine?"

"…Huh, …um."

"To me, Clark, when we triumphantly return to the royal capital, it’s not hard to imagine how well you will be received by the people I introduce you to…"

<b>

<b>

They say that the holders of grade A will return in a week, but if they need to prepare again from there, it will take another 1 to 2 weeks.

Being held up in a place like this for nearly a month is no joke.

If unnecessary expenses pile up, his evaluation will drop.

Moreover, he had no idea what kind of reputation the returning grade A holders would have.

Such a gamble was not something he could afford.

It was best to depart as soon as possible.

<b>

After all, the head of the delegation himself said he would stand up. There was no better deal than this.

If he could send the lord off, there was no doubt that his evaluation would rise to the highest level.

He could not afford to have Clark's selfishness spoil this.

He had to make sure he went.

<b>

While holding such thoughts, Fourier continued to persuade Clark.

<b>

<b>

"Um… um…"

<b>

"…And did you forget? You don’t have to proceed through Iloshio for long! Once you confirm the completion of the base camp you will set up after advancing for 3 to 4 days, you can return with the supply team. …It’s just a matter of 4 to 5 days."

"…Y-yes, that’s right… yes, that’s right!"

<b>

"You don’t need to worry at all, Clark! You just need to think about the promised glory."

"Y-yes! Then, as promised! Please ensure that I am introduced to everyone upon the success of the expedition!"

<b>

"Yes! Leave it to me!"

<b>

Even before the sun reached its peak, the faint laughter of despicable men echoed quietly in the dim room.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hmph! Disagreeable bunch!"

<b>

After the meeting with the delegation representative, Howard and the heads of the three families went to the council meeting room.

As soon as Silence sat down, he spat out venomous words.

<b>

"Don't say that, Silence. That man is just honest about his ambition."

"Words matter, Head. He is merely selfish, willing to use any means for his ambition."

<b>

Howard shrugged at Alphonse's exasperated words.

<b>

"Well, he probably understands a bit about probing each other's intentions, just like you all do."

<b>

Saying this, Howard looked at Silence and Alphonse with a playful squint.

Silence and Alphonse turned their eyes away, not understanding what he meant.

<b>

"It was quite amusing to watch the roles of instigator and pacifier being played out mutually."

"That was neatly turned upside down. Truly, Head, you are a bad person…"

<b>

Alphonse sighed again in exasperation.

<b>

"I had already heard about that man from Annemarie..."

"From the intelligence network of the Bylos family? Could it be that the two who got out of the carriage yesterday…?"

"Yes, they had quite a hard time..."

<b>

Nodding at August's question, Howard confirmed that the women who had shared the carriage with Fourier yesterday were connected to Amkam.

<b>

"That man is always concerned with how highly he can be evaluated..."

"Just as he appears, a greedy fellow!"

<b>

Silence spat out disdainfully.

<b>

"However, he is ultimately just a simpleton who is loyal to the bait in front of him. It would be better to give him a favor than to leave behind unnecessary grudges."

<b>

"That doesn’t mean the Head should go out himself! Anyone among us would suffice!"

<b>

"By bringing one or two grade A individuals, my evaluation will greatly rise by being sent out. There is no greater bait for him than me. And August… I have already told you. You three families cannot be absent from the village for long."

<b>

"They do not understand! What it means to challenge the depths of Iloshio! …A single moment of carelessness could lead to unforeseen events… even a child from this village knows that! They completely fail to understand!!"

"We are here to guide them."

"So, I think someone among us should go…"

"August! You are Amkam because of us… we cannot afford any unforeseen circumstances. You are not a 'decoration' like me."

"There is no substitute for the Head!!"

"Calm down, August."

<b>

Silence lightly tapped August's chest with his left hand to calm him down.

August took a breath and steadied his breathing.

<b>

"And now, that child is here… We have someone we can entrust this to. Don’t you think we can challenge this without worry?"

"…Head."

"Isn't it natural for a man born in Amkam to challenge the abyss?"

<b>

<b>

Since ancient times, the people of Amkam have survived by clearing the heavily encroached Great Iloshio Forest.

For those living in Amkam, stepping deeper into the depths of the Great Forest was the greatest honor.

However, it also meant that it was a path with slim chances of returning alive.

<b>

"To live in the forest and return to it." August recalled the old saying.

<b>

In the past, when the people of Amkam lived in difficult times.

When children were weighed between life and death in the forest.

A saying from a time when not only children but also the elderly entrusted their fate to the forest.

<b>

That era was no longer the case.

Yet, Howard seemed to imply that he was seeking a place to die in the depths of the forest.

<b>

<b>

August, Silence, and Alphonse glared at Howard from behind him, looking up at the portrait of the first lord of Amkam, Gioloa Amkam.

<b>

The three of them focused on the words engraved on the majestic frame.

<b>

"To those who venture into Iloshio, tread upon this land with unwavering resolve."

<b>

August gasped. Alphonse and Silence also froze.

<b>

"And… stepping into the depths of Iloshio… this is my last opportunity!"

"Head… you…"

"There is something there that must be returned to me."

<b>

Howard spoke quietly before the three.

<b>

"There… Roland is waiting!"

<b>

The flames of the man who continued to smolder until the end were reflected in Howard's eyes.

The unquenchable flame that had been burning deep within his chest.

The torrent of desire that had continued unabated, the indomitable spirit that would never fade.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

That evening, dinner was served in the hall of Amkam House, with Howard Papa, Sonia Mama, and the three of us.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, the village is in an unprecedented state of chaos and unease.

The knight order has arrived, and the work at the town hall is said to be in complete disarray.

<b>

At Amkam House, the village head, Mr. August, and the heads of the three families are staying overnight to work.

<b>

As a result, meals are often shared with everyone.

Especially at dinner, everyone gathers for information exchange, so we eat together.

Often, Mrs. Molly from the Beers family and Mrs. Jane from the Croki family also come to join us.

<b>

Last night, the Croki family came as a whole, so Bibi and my brother Ed also had dinner together.

Somehow, having a meal with a large group like this is a bit fun.

<b>

<b>

But tonight, Howard Papa said he wanted to have dinner with just the three of us.

<b>

While having dinner, I was telling the two about what had happened that day.

<b>

The knight order's equipment was so shocking that I couldn't help but talk about it…

The two listened with cheerful expressions the whole time.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After that, while enjoying tea after the meal, Howard Papa said he had something to discuss with Sonia Mama and me.

<b>

Mr. Elrose and Annemarie prepared the tea for us.

<b>

Under the watchful eye of Mr. Elrose, Annemarie danced the tea leaves in the pot and carefully poured the tea.

<b>

While enjoying the rising aroma, the three of us quietly sipped tea for a while without speaking.

From Howard Papa, I felt a flow of gentle yet profound will, as if he had settled his thoughts.

<b>

Sonia Mama seemed to have a quiet yet deep and gentle heart,

as if she were trying to fully embrace what was about to come…

<b>

"……I have decided to go on the exploration of Iloshio."

<b>

Papa suddenly brought it up.

Sonia Mama's hand, which had been bringing the tea to her mouth, froze.

<b>

"Howard…"

"This is probably… the last opportunity…"

<b>

"………"

"I will depart on the 29th, in three days."

<b>

Sonia Mama's hand, which seemed to want to say something, reached for the air, then quietly placed both hands on her knees as if reconsidering.

<b>

"Tomorrow, I will return home once to prepare. Suzy, will you help me?"

"Ah… y-yes."

<b>

Seeing Sonia Mama with her eyes downcast, I felt a sharp pain in my chest as if I could see her inner turmoil.

<b>

"Ah, um! Howard Papa…!"

"Suzy, I’m counting on you for the village… You promised, right?"

<b>

"Ah… y-yes."

"The village… and Sonia, I entrust to you. …It’s a promise."

<b>

Howard Papa spoke with a very gentle and soft gaze, deeply embedding that determination in his heart while looking into my eyes.

<b>

"Ah… Howard, Papa… Sonia, Mama…!"

<b>

I placed my hand over Sonia Mama's hand sitting next to me, quietly gazing at her face as she looked at the teacup, and gently held her slightly cold hand.

Sonia Mama tightly gripped my hand in return.

I apologize for that—<m(__)m>
