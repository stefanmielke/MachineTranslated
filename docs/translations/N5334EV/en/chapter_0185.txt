# Chapter 173: The Mother and Daughter in the Basement

And now we arrive at the present... That's the situation.

<b>

Right now, I am wearing wooden handcuffs on my wrists and iron shackles connected by chains on both ankles.

The length of the chain on my ankles is about shoulder width, so it seems difficult to run like this.

The chains themselves are thick and large, so they must weigh a fair amount. Normally, it would be quite hard to even walk while dragging them.

<b>

The wooden handcuffs are of the type that sandwiches two boards cut into semicircles from above and below.

The thickness of the boards is probably over 5 centimeters?

The square part of the handcuffs has metal decorations, but the fasteners don’t look particularly sturdy.

There are engravings that resemble magical seals, so they might be held in place by some magical means.

Either way, they don’t feel very durable.

If I apply a little force, they seem like they could break, so I need to be careful with my strength.

<b>

However, it’s clear that these people have quite a taste for chaining up a maiden like this.

<b>

And they are all unmistakably red.

There are six red presences outside this room. In other words, there are six people.

In addition, there are about ten non-red presences in this basement.

<b>

Out of those presences, two are in this room. In other words, there are two other people trapped here besides me.

They probably were kidnapped in a similar manner as I was.

The two are not handcuffed, but they have shackles on their ankles and look severely worn out.

<b>

Both are women; could they be mother and daughter? One looks to be a little younger than me, and the other seems to be the mother?

They appear to be in their 40s to 50s, but they might look older than they are due to their exhaustion.

<b>

The daughter (?), seems to be leaning against her parent (?), and they are sitting against the wall, their eyes vacant and their complexion quite poor.

If I speak to them, they barely manage to respond, but they have almost no vitality.

<b>

The more I look, the worse their condition seems.

They have bruises all over as if they were beaten. Dirty cloths are wrapped around their shoulders and arms, and brown stains are spreading from there.

Does this mean they are just wrapping their injuries with unsanitary makeshift bandages?

<b>

Even more horrifying, the right toes of the person who seems to be the parent... the front part from the middle of the foot is missing.

That area is also wrapped in filthy cloth, and blood-like stains have dried there.

<b>

Have they had their toes cut off to prevent escape?

<b>

When I realized that, my blood boiled in an instant.

I felt like kicking down that rusty iron door and immediately taking the two of them out.

<b>

But losing my temper here would be pointless. I need to take down the main source of this situation.

I took a slow, deep breath and approached the two, chanting "Greater Heal."

<b>

A pillar of light enveloped the two, and their wounds began to heal before my eyes.

The swollen bruises on their faces and limbs disappeared, and the missing parts of their toes pushed up the cloth and began to grow back.

<b>

They must have been shocked by the sudden recovery. The two opened their eyes wide and exclaimed at the sight of each other's injuries disappearing.

<b>

"Is this... magic? You could use magic?!"

<b>

The girl who seems to be the daughter exclaimed towards me.

<b>

"Y-Your toes... Could it be! Holy Maiden?!"

<b>

The woman who seems to be the mother also raised her voice.

No, that’s not right! I’m not a holy maiden!

<b>

"I only have a little knowledge of healing. Are you both okay? Do you have any ailments?"

"…Y-You say just a little... This is beyond the scope of 'healing'..."

"Why are you in a place like this? Could you tell me your names?"

<b>

The woman who seems to be the mother looked unconvinced, but I forcefully changed the subject and got their names.

<b>

"I apologize for the late introduction. I am Laria Heiberman. This child is my daughter, Viola. I cannot express how grateful I am for healing such terrible injuries... Thank you, Holy Maiden."

<b>

No, please don’t bow! I’ve told you I’m not a holy maiden!

<b>

Laria is 35 years old. Viola is 13 years old.

Laria, now fully recovered, looks much younger than my first impression. She must have been extremely exhausted.

<b>

From what I heard, the two have been trapped in this building for over six months.

Six months in a place like this?!

I thought it was amazing they had survived until now, but it seems they were treated a bit better at first.

<b>

Though it was hard, they could use a bed, and while the meals were simple, they were given two meals a day.

However, they were not allowed to go outside and were in a complete state of confinement.

<b>

But about half a month ago, they tried to escape when they saw an opportunity, but they were easily caught and thrown in here.

During that time, they were severely beaten, and to ensure they would never try to escape again, the mother's toes were cut off.

Viola, perhaps recalling that moment, spoke while shedding tears.

<b>

"My father is the captain of the guards in this town, so they must be using us as hostages to control him!"

<b>

That’s why she thought they needed to get out of here quickly! Viola cried, and Laria hugged her.

<b>

It seems the sun will soon set.

The right side of the window frame is beginning to be tinged with the colors of dusk from the sunlight coming in from the west.

The little gray creature peeking in from there is quietly listening to the two's conversation.

<b>

I see.

There are decent people in the town's guard, but Roderick said he hasn’t received any favorable responses.

There must be many people like these two here.

Not just in the basement, but there are several red presences and other people's reactions in the above ground area as well.

<b>

I asked how many other people besides the two of them are being held in this building, but they said they don’t know.

<b>

"You’ll be able to get out of here soon, so don’t worry, okay?"

<b>

I nodded while looking at the little creature and said that to the two.

<b>

"Huh? But how...? You were captured too, right?"

"With those heavy handcuffs... Have they done anything terrible to you?"

<b>

I wanted to reassure them, but it’s understandable they wouldn’t believe me right away.

On the contrary, the mother and daughter, with red eyes, were worried about my well-being. Hmm, they are good people!

<b>

I waved my hands lightly and stepped with my feet, saying, "These handcuffs are nothing."

Then both of them widened their eyes and asked, "Why?"

Huh? Why? What do you mean?

<b>

At that moment, Viola's stomach let out a cute "Grrr" sound.

Viola, embarrassed, pressed her hands against her stomach.

<b>

Apparently, since they were put in this basement, they had only been given one piece of bread every three days for meals.

Water was similarly provided only once every three days, just a small pitcher, which was barely enough to survive.

<b>

After injuring their feet like that, how could they expect to provide no nutrition in such unsanitary conditions? What do they plan to do if they get an infection?

They are treating them as if their lives don’t matter!

As I grasped the situation, my anger gauge began to rise!

<b>

<b>

So I said, "It doesn’t taste like much, but if you’d like," and took out "food" from my inventory.

What I pulled out was "Mom's Salmon Stew"...

I have no other food to offer.

<b>

The "Greater Heal" I used earlier restores not only physical injuries but also mental and physical stamina, but it doesn’t alleviate hunger.

I wanted to at least give them something solid to eat after being forced to live on bread and water for days.

...Even if it has almost no taste...

<b>

Suddenly presented with a steaming bowl of stew, the two looked wide-eyed and exclaimed, "Where did this come from?!"

I put my index finger to my lips and asked for secrecy, but Laria once again joined her hands and said, "Holy Maiden!"

So I’m not a holy maiden!

<b>

Despite it being a tasteless stew, the two were very happy to eat it. I asked, "Doesn’t it have any flavor?" and Viola replied, "It’s light, but it’s still delicious!"

And both of them finished it off in no time.

<b>

I realized that for the mother and daughter who had been living on just a little water and bread for a week or two, this was a tremendous feast.

Having complained about "bad" or "not delicious" food just from a day or two of hunger years ago, I now feel an overwhelming sense of shame.

<b>

Alright! I will do everything I can for these two!

<b>

With that in mind, I cast "Protect Melody" on them.

Originally, this enchantment increases the target's physical and magical defense by about 60%.

There are also effects that reduce the chance of receiving critical hits, but if the target's original specs are low, it doesn’t help much.

<b>

However, thanks to my training in adjusting energy and magical power, I have become quite flexible with this as well.

<b>

With the effect I just gave them, they should be able to easily deflect a certain amount of physical attacks.

A thug swinging a dull weapon wouldn’t even be a concern.

I adjusted the magical power flowing in so that the effect would last a full day.

<b>

With the current people here, they wouldn’t even be able to leave a scratch on these two.

<b>

The reddish hue of the sunlight illuminating the window frame signals that dusk is approaching.

<b>

Roderick said he would return before the sun sets. He hasn’t yet entered my exploration range, but it should be about time for him to arrive at Hexagom.

<b>

If that’s the case, the people here should be moving soon.

Right, I should give something to Viola while I have the chance.

<b>

I slowly lifted my skirt and took out a capsule about the size of my pinky finger that I had tucked into the garter holding up my thigh-high socks.

The two were startled when I raised my skirt to my thighs, but I’m not doing anything weird, okay?

<b>

When I pressed the end of the capsule slightly, a ring-shaped part detached.

I offered the ring towards Viola.

<b>

While holding the ring in her hand, I told her, "If you keep this, I will definitely be able to find you no matter where you are, so please keep it close to you."

<b>

Well then, it seems the movements of the people outside are becoming more active.

The real game is about to begin. I intend to wrap things up properly by morning!
