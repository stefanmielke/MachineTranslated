# 173 Mother and Daughter in the Basement

And here we are at .......

<blank>

I now have wooden shackles on my wrists and iron shackles chained around my ankles.

The length of the chain attached to the ankle is about shoulder width, so it would be difficult to run as it is.

The chain itself is thick and large, so I think it weighs a good deal. Normally, it would be hard to drag it around.

<blank>

The wooden manacles are made of two boards cut into a semicircle and placed between the upper and lower boards.

Is the board more than 5 cm thick?

The squares of the manacles are decorated with metal ornaments, but the metal clasps that hold them in place don't look that robust.

It may have been stayed in place by a magical procedure, since it has a magical seal-like imprint.

Either way, it doesn't feel very sturdy.

If you put a little force on it, it might break, so you have to be careful how much force you use.

<blank>

But I can clearly see that they have a moderately good taste in putting such a damsel on a leash.

<blank>

And they are red without leaks.

There are six of those red reactions outside this room. In short, there are six of them.

Besides that, there are about 10 other reactions of people who are not red in this basement.

<blank>

Two of those reactions are in this room. In other words, there are two other people in front of me who are trapped.

Perhaps they were kidnapped just like me.

The two are not shackled, but their shackles are chained and they look severely worn out.

<blank>

Two women, father and son, one a little younger than me? One a little younger than me, the other a mother?

They look like they are in their 40s and 50s, but maybe they are too worn out and look older than they should.

<blank>

The daughter(?) s parents (?). The two of them were sitting leaning against the wall, their eyes were vacant and their complexion was quite pale.

If you talk to them, they barely respond, but they are almost lifeless.

<blank>

The more I look at them, the worse they both look.

He has bruises here and there as if he had been beaten. A dirty cloth is wrapped around her shoulders and arms, from which brown stains are spreading.

Does this mean that you're just wearing an unhygienic bandage thingy on your injury?

<blank>

Even more fearlessly, the right toe of the person who seems to be the parent ...... is missing from about the middle of the instep to the tip of the foot.

There, too, a dirty cloth was wrapped around the body, and a stain that looked like blood was still clinging to it.

<blank>

Are their toes cut off so they can't escape?

<blank>

When I realized this, I instantly felt a rush of blood to my head.

I would kick in the rusty iron door there and take them both out immediately.

<blank>

But if you lose your temper here, you're back to square one. We can't talk about it unless we destroy the source of the problem.

I took a slow deep breath and approached them and chanted "Greater Heel".

<blank>

A pillar of light envelops the two, repairing their wounds as it goes.

The bruises on his swollen face and limbs disappear, and his missing toes push up the fabric and stretch.

<blank>

The two men, perhaps surprised by the sudden recovery of their bodies, open their eyes and exclaim to each other that the wounds on their bodies have vanished.

<blank>

'Is this ...... magic? You could use magic?

<blank>

A girl, who seems to be a daughter, shouts this to me.

<blank>

I said, "Tsk, my toes are on ............. No way! Saint Mary? !"

<blank>

A person who appeared to be the mother also raised her voice.

No, sir! I am not a saint!

<blank>

I just know a little bit about 'healing'. Are you okay? Are you feeling all right?

"......, just a little bit is ....... This is not in the category of 'healing' ......."

Why are you here? Can you tell me your names, please?"

<blank>

The person who seemed to be the mother was unconvinced, but I forcefully changed the subject and asked her to tell me her name.

<blank>

My name is Lalia Haverman. My name is Laria Heiberman. This is my daughter Viola. I don't know how to thank you ...... for healing me from such a terrible injury, thank you saint."

<blank>

No, please don't worship me! I told you I am not a saint!

<blank>

Ms. Lalia is 35 years old. Viola is 13 years old.

Rallia, now completely recovered, is much younger than I first thought. She must have been worn out after all.

<blank>

According to their story, the two have been locked in this building for more than six months now.

Six months in a place like this?

I wondered how he had survived all this time! I thought so, but I heard that they were treated a little more decently in the beginning.

<blank>

The beds were hard but usable, and although the food was simple, two meals a day were served.

However, they were not allowed to go outside and seemed to be in a state of complete confinement.

<blank>

However, about half a month ago, he saw an opening and tried to escape, but he easily failed and was caught and thrown into Coco.

He was severely beaten and his mother's toes were cut off to prevent him from ever escaping again.

My daughter, Viola, told me about that time, spilling tears as she recalled it.

<blank>

Dad, he's the head of the guard here in town, so he must have taken us hostage and is making us do his bidding!

<blank>

That's why I thought I had to get out of here as soon as possible! Viola cries. And Rallia hugs her.

<blank>

The sun will be setting soon.

The right side of the window frame was beginning to turn a slight evening hue from the sunlight hitting it from the west.

The small gray animal peeking out from there is also quietly listening to them.

<blank>

I see.

Roderick said that there are some decent people in the Guard in this city, but he has not received a very colorful response.

I am sure there are a number of people like them here.

There are several red signs and other people's reactions not only in the basement but also in the ground part of the building.

<blank>

We asked how many other people are trapped in this building besides the two of you, but they said they don't know.

<blank>

You'll be out of here soon, okay?"

<blank>

He nodded while staring at the small animal and told them so.

<blank>

What?" But how did you get ......? You got caught too, didn't you?"

"They even put such heavy shackles on me. ...... They haven't done anything terrible to you?"

<blank>

I said this to reassure you both, but, well, I don't believe in ikkis.

On the contrary, the father and son, who were hugging each other with red eyes, were conversely concerned for my well being. Well, they are good people!

<blank>

I said, "These shackles are nothing," and lightly waved my hands up and down, and even showed them the steps with my feet.

Then we both roll our eyes, "Why?" and roll their eyes.

What? Why? What do you mean?

<blank>

There, Viola's stomach made a lovely "cooing" sound.

Viola holds her stomach in embarrassment.

<blank>

Since he was put in this basement, he has eaten only one piece of bread every three days.

They were also given only a small pitcher of water once every three days, just barely enough to keep them alive.

<blank>

What are you going to do if they have a serious leg injury, and you don't feed them in such an unsanitary place, or if they get an infection?

It's treated as if you don't care if you die!

Every time I get a grip on a situation, my anger gauge goes up!

<blank>

<blank>

So I said, "I hope you don't mind that it has almost no taste," and took the "meal" out of my inventory.

I served "Mam's Salmon Stew" .......

There is no other food we can serve.

<blank>

The "Greater Heal" I used earlier restores energy and stamina as well as physical damage, but it does not eliminate hunger.

They had been forced to live on bread and water for days, and we wanted them to at least have something solid to eat.

......Almost tasteless, though. ......

<blank>

Suddenly, a steamy stew dish was presented in front of them, and they rolled their eyes and asked, "Where in the world did that come from?!" They were surprised.

I put my index finger to my mouth and asked, "Don't tell anyone," but Ms. Rallia again said, "Saint!" I asked her to put her hand together again.

That's why I'm not a saint.

<blank>

It was supposed to be a tasteless stew, but they were very happy to eat it. I asked them, "It doesn't taste good, does it?" but Viola said, "It's light, but it's really good! Viola said.

And they both flattened it clean in no time.

<blank>

I realize that for a mother and daughter who had been kept alive for a week or two with only a little water and bread, this was a great treat.

I am now feeling irrationally ashamed of myself of many years ago, when I used to complain that the food was "tasteless" or "not tasty" after a day or two of hunger at most.

<blank>

Alright! Let's give these two the best we can!

<blank>

So, I chanted "Protective Melody" to them.

The original enchanted channeler skill raises the target's physical and magical defenses by about 60%.

There are other effects, such as reducing the criticality rate received, but they cannot help if the original specs of the target are low.

<blank>

However, thanks to my training in Ki and magic adjustment, I am now able to be much more flexible in this regard.

<blank>

With the effect you just gave the two of them, they can play some physical attacks with ease.

It is not enough to talk to the extent that a thug wields a namakra.

We also adjusted the magic power that flowed into the system so that the effect lasted for a full day.

<blank>

I don't think these guys here can even put a scratch on these two anymore.

<blank>

The glowing color of the sun shining on the edge of the window tells us that nightfall will soon be upon us.

<blank>

Roderick said he would be back before the sun set. Although not yet in my search area, it is about time to arrive at Hexagom.

<blank>

If that is the case, the people here should be moving soon.

Yes, let's give it to Viola while we're at it.

<blank>

I slowly rolled up my skirt and took out a capsule-shaped object, about the size of the tip of my pinky finger, which was tucked into the thigh garter that hung from my thigh thigh-high socks.

When I lifted my skirt up to my thighs, they were upset, but it wasn't like I was doing anything weird, you know?

<blank>

A slight push on the edge of that removed capsule separates the ring-shaped parts.

He held out that ring toward Viola.

<blank>

He puts the ring in her hand and tells her, "I want you to keep this with you, because wherever you are, I can always find you.

<blank>

Well, now, I guess it's time for the guys outside to get moving.

It's just the beginning. I'm determined to get it all done by morning!
