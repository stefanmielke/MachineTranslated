# 11 Epilogue Suzy is in a great hurry

This is an introductory chapter epilogue. It is short ^^^;


----------------

<blank>

I'm hungry. ......"

<blank>

I can't help but spill my heart out.

<blank>

Now they were moving forward with their backs against the hollow where the orc settlement had been.

They are heading west to cleanse themselves in the river.

<blank>

In case you are wondering, I put on my underwear just now.

<blank>

He seemed a little remorseful for having inadvertently lured the orc by releasing the scent of a woman.

<blank>

'And yet, Coco is not another 10 km from the edge of the forest, is it? ...... It's not good to have such a dangerous colony this far from human habitation, is it? Maybe we should ...... look around the area a little more before we go out to the human settlement. ......

<blank>

He seems to have started thinking up some sort of excuse.

<blank>

Yeah, but food security is a depressing problem. ...... Speaking of which, those filthy creatures were handled very well. ...... I didn't know what kind of animal it was, but it looked like deer, boar, ...... and some fish. ...... No, I don't want it! I don't want it! I would never eat anything made by the hands of filth! ......? Wait a minute! A fish? There's fish! If it's fish, you don't have to take it apart, do you? That's right! Why didn't I notice that before? If it's fish, we can just grill it! Oh my God! Why didn't I notice that before? Am I an idiot? I'm so stupid! I've got to get to the river! Let's get some fish! River fish! I might need some salt, but I'm fine without it! Fish! It's a grilled fish party! Yee-hoo!

<blank>

When he ran out of the house with an unintentional sense of joy,......, he raised his right arm instantly and turned the sword he was holding to his back. I instantly lifted my right arm, put the sword I was holding behind my back, and with a clang, I slashed at something that flew by at high speed.

<blank>

<blank>

"Yeah, again?"

<blank>

It was "Bread Beetle.

<blank>

Why are you coming back?

<blank>

The fake Kansai dialect stinks.

<blank>

"Are you trying to get back at me for yesterday?　What kind of a drug dealer brings his friends to pay a visit?　How dare you find me?　You're a stalker!　Girls don't like you!　Wow, this is over 500, isn't it?

<blank>

With a cry that could neither be described as a complaint nor a scream, they cut down the flying Beetles one after another.

<blank>

Breadbeetle's initial velocity exceeds 500 m/s.

A series of bursts above the speed of sound, and machine guns come flying in like scattering bullets.

<blank>

The sword in the opposite hand makes a metallic sound, leaving an afterimage of the blade as it slashes and flicks one after another.

<blank>

I've cut something boring again, and I don't mean ......!　There's no end to this!　I can't wait to go get some fish!　I can't wait to go get some fish!　I'll just use my skills and blow it ...... again."

<blank>

Nope. Wait ...... and stop thinking about it.

<blank>

Coco is no more than 10 kilometers from a human village.

What if I unleash my fancy skills in such a place and do a lot of damage to a wide area of forest?

<blank>

The number of people there now is over 500, far more than yesterday.

If all of them were to be eradicated at once, the power would be unmatched by yesterday.

<blank>

(Oh no!　I can't use it now!)

<blank>

We are supposed to have just burned down an orc settlement earlier, but apparently orcs don't count.

<blank>

Oh, it's such a pain in the ass!　I have to drop everything!　What is this work?　Is this a pain in the ass?　...... Well, I'll do it!　I'll do it!　...... No?　Wait a minute. Why don't you just use this one?"

<blank>

I still decided to use my skills.

<blank>

Waste, waste, waste!"

<blank>

≪'The World of Fear'.

Enchantment Channeler Skills.

A skill that instills fear in enemies weaker than oneself over a wide area centered on oneself and causes them to flee.

<blank>

The air around me changed.

I froze in an instant.

Fear quickly flooded out of Susie and spread over a wide area.

<blank>

The forest shook with a zap.

<blank>

The creatures, as they were called, began to flee from around Suzy as fast as they could.

<blank>

Wahahahahahaha." Did you see that? Even I can do it! This is how we can resolve this problem peacefully! I have successfully repelled the enemy without destroying nature! Wahahahahaha h...... Oh, what is that? I'm not sure what to say! You're running away too fast, aren't you? You guys are running away too much, aren't you? What do you mean the mobs over 5 kilometers away are also running away? Whaaaat? It's not good! Oh no! It's overflowing! It's overflowing out of the forest! It's coming out!

<blank>

For some reason, the phrasing is obscene at the end, but I was in a great hurry.

<blank>

If this continues, there will be a massive avalanche of Mob into human settlements.

It would be like having a little stampede.

There may even be casualties.

<blank>

It tastes bad!

<blank>

Suzy ran south as fast as she could in a panic to destroy all the mobs.

<blank>

'Uhhhhhhhh!　SAKANAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

<blank>

I ran crying.
