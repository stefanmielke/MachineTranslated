# Episode 11 Epilogue: Suzy in a Great Fluster

This is the prologue epilogue. It's short＾＾；

----------------

<b>

"I'm so hungry..."

<b>

My feelings slipped out.

<b>

Right now, I was moving forward with the hollow where the orc village used to be at my back.

I was heading west to cleanse my body in the river.

<b>

By the way, I just put on my underwear.

<b>

It seems I felt a little regret for carelessly giving off a woman's scent and luring in orcs.

<b>

"Still, it's not even 10 kilometers from the edge of the forest... Isn't it dangerous to have such a perilous colony this close to human settlements? ...Maybe I should look around this area a bit more before heading to the village..."

<b>

It seemed I was starting to think of some excuses.

<b>

"Ah, but securing food is a gloomy problem... Speaking of which, those filthy creatures were handling it quite well... I couldn't really tell what kind of animal it was, but it looked kind of like a deer or a boar... There were also fish... No! I don't want that! I would never eat anything from those filthy hands! ...Huh? Wait a minute?! Fish?! Was there fish?! If it's fish, I don't have to gut it, right?! That's it! Why didn't I realize this sooner? If it's fish, I can just grill it as is! What the heck! I've been by the water this whole time, why didn't I notice?! Am I an idiot?! A big idiot!! I need to hurry to the river!! I'm going to catch fish! River fish! I might want some salt, but it's fine as is! Fish! It's a grilled fish party! Yay!!"

<b>

Just as I was about to joyfully run off... I instantly raised my right arm, turned the sword I was holding behind my back, and deflected something that flew at me at high speed with my sword.

<b>

<b>

"Ugh, not again?"

<b>

It was a "Bread Beetle."

<b>

"Why are you coming again?!"

<b>

My fake Kansai dialect sounded suspicious.

<b>

"Is this revenge for yesterday? Bringing your friends for a thank-you visit? What kind of yakuza are you?! How did you find me?! Are you a stalker?! Girls hate that, you know?! Wow, this one has over 500, right?"

<b>

While letting out a scream that was part grumbling and part shriek, I slashed down the incoming beetles one after another.

<b>

The initial speed of the Bread Beetle exceeds 500 m/s.

It made a series of sonic booms as it flew in like a machine gun scattering bullets.

<b>

I swung my sword in reverse grip, producing metallic sounds as I deflected them one after another, leaving behind afterimages of the blade.

<b>

"I ended up cutting something pointless again... No, wait! This is really endless!!! I want to go catch fish already!! Damn it! I have to blow them away with a skill again..."

<b>

No. Wait... I hesitated.

<b>

I'm only about 10 kilometers away from human settlements now.

What would happen if I unleashed a flashy skill here and dealt massive damage to the surrounding forest?

<b>

The number of them here is far greater than yesterday, over 500.

If I were to wipe them all out at once, the power wouldn't compare to yesterday.

<b>

(This is bad!! I can't use it now!!)

<b>

I had just burned down the orc village, but it seems orcs don't count.

<b>

"Ugh, this is so annoying! Do I have to take them all down?! What is this task? This suffering? ...Well, I will do it! I will do it!! ...Wait? Maybe I can use this one instead?"

<b>

I decided to use a skill after all.

<b>

"Useless, useless, useless!"

<b>

≪The World of Fear≫

A skill of the Enchant Channeler.

It plants fear in enemies weaker than oneself over a wide area centered on oneself, causing them to flee.

<b>

The air around me changed.

It froze in an instant.

Fear burst forth from Suzy and spread over a wide area.

<b>

The forest trembled.

<b>

With tremendous speed, every living creature began to flee from around Suzy with all their might.

<b>

"Wahahahahaha! Did you see that?! I can also solve things peacefully like this! I managed to repel the enemy without destroying nature! Wahahahaha... Huh, wait? Hold on! Aren't you all fleeing too much?! What do you mean, mobs are fleeing from over 5 kilometers away?! Waaaah?! This is bad!! Ahhh! It's overflowing! It's overflowing from the forest!! It's coming out!!!"

<b>

For some reason, the phrasing at the end became vulgar, but I was in a great fluster.

<b>

At this rate, a massive number of mobs would avalanche into the human settlement.

It would cause a bit of a stampede.

There might even be casualties.

<b>

This is bad!!

<b>

Suzy hurriedly ran south with all her might to wipe out the mobs.

<b>

"Uhee~~n! Fishhhh!"

<b>

I ran while crying.
