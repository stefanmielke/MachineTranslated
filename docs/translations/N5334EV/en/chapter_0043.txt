# Interlude 1: Let’s Go to the Sea

A story during summer vacation.

It's what you call a swimsuit episode!

----------------

<b>

“Yaaay! I’m the first one in!!”

<b>

Dana was the first to run towards the waves, shaking her barely-covered backside in a cherry pink bikini.

<b>

“Ah! Dana! That’s so unfair!!”

<b>

Karla kicked up sand as she ran towards Dana, who was already off.

<b>

Karla's swimsuit was a halter-neck bikini with fine stripes of white and lapis lazuli.

She zipped past Dana, sending her flying from the force of her speed.

<b>

Chasing after Karla, Alicia and Jessica also ran towards the waves.

<b>

Alicia wore a sophisticated white halter-neck one-piece with a large cutout at the back and sides.

Jessica flaunted her great figure in a black micro bikini, tying her usually loose braids into a bun on either side of her head.

The two of them splashed through the waves, sending sprays of seawater everywhere.

<b>

“Come on, Suu! Hurry up!!”

<b>

Karla and the others were calling me from the waves.

<b>

Dana, having been blown away, dragged her head out of the sand and let out a big puff of air.

<b>

“That’s so mean, Karla!!”

<b>

She shouted while spitting out sand.

<b>

The beach was dazzlingly white and smooth.

The deep sky blue sky was filled with large, white cumulus clouds, embodying summer.

The sparkling emerald green sea was indeed blinding, and the sound of the waves was pleasant to the ears.

<b>

“Come on, Suu-chan!”

<b>

As I was captivated by the sea, Mia, who was standing next to me, called out.

<b>

…Mia was wearing a tube top bikini with a V-shaped cutout at the chest!

What is that?! Doesn’t it spill out? Doesn’t it slip off?!

Her already large breasts were emphasized even more!

The fabric had violet stripes, giving it an oddly mature and sexy vibe!

If it were to poke out at my nose, I wouldn’t be able to look away!!

<b>

Even so, I couldn’t help but cover my own chest with my hands, feeling something I couldn’t quite accept!

<b>

“It won’t change anything if you cover up now!”

<b>

A voice whispered from behind me!!

When I turned around, there she was! Yes! Bibi!!

<b>

Bibi was wearing a bright peppermint green swimsuit with white polka dots.

The back was wide open, but it was a cute one-piece with a small skirt.

The large ribbon at the chest was probably the focal point?

<b>

Her hair, usually flowing down her back, was tied into twin tails on either side of her head, topped with a large straw hat.

Bibi was radiating a rich girl vibe, huh!?

<b>

Of course, Bibi is a real rich girl!

This beach is the Kuroki family's private beach.

And the place we’re staying at in New Noxport is also the Kuroki family's vacation home.

As expected of one of the Amukamu Three Families, the Kuroki family's daughter! When I said that, I got a suspicious look and was asked, “You’re the one saying that?”

<b>

Well! More than that, the issue at hand is Bibi's outrageous comment!!

I had a matter that I couldn’t accept!!

<b>

“It’s strange, I should be a C... so why is this a B?!”

<b>

My swimsuit was a cute canola yellow bikini.

The cut of the V-zone was quite daring.

But the larger frills attached to the top and bottom emphasized cuteness rather than lewdness, making it a rather lovely design that I liked.

However, the problem was the size.

That’s right, the underwear I usually wear is a stretchy free size, and while there’s no clear indication, it should be a C!

Yet! This swimsuit fits perfectly, but for some reason, the size is a B! I can’t accept it!!

<b>

“Huh? What are you talking about? You don’t even have a C?!”

“Wha!? I do! It should be a C minus, so it’s a C!”

“See! There’s no such thing as a C minus! That’s a B!!”

<b>

“G-Gaaah!!” A comic-style sound effect dropped above my head!

<b>

“Listen! You are a B! B!!”

<b>

Bibi put her left hand on her hip and pointed her right index finger at me.

I weakly placed both hands on the ground. Ouch!

<b>

“Recognize it properly! That you are a B!!”

“No... that’s not right! Even if I try to cover it with a ribbon, what’s not there doesn’t change!!”

<b>

Bibi stepped back, clutching her chest with both hands.

<b>

“I-I have it! I-I definitely have it!!”

“I-I can grab it properly!”

“I-I can grab it too?!!”

“Lies! Bibi is lying!”

<b>

This time, I stood up and pointed my finger at Bibi!

Objection!!

<b>

“I’m not lying! I can grab it!”

“You can’t grab it!!”

“W-Wait! B and C aren’t that different! It’s not a big deal!? Besides! You’re covering it up with frills too!!”

“Eek!”

<b>

I can! I can’t! I can grab it! I can’t! And then, as Bibi and I got teary-eyed and entered into a mudslinging match...

<b>

“C-Come on, both of you calm down! Okay? This isn’t something to fight about, right? It’s not a big deal, right? Let’s calm down?”

<b>

We glared at the one who dropped such an outrageous bombshell with teary eyes.

<b>

““You’re the last one to say that!!!!””

<b>

And at that moment, we both grabbed and squeezed her unnecessarily large breasts at the same time!

<b>

“Nggh! N-No! Nnngh! Nnnnnnnnnnnn!!”

““Waaahhh!!!””

<b>

We both cried and squeezed away!

<b>

“Ng! No! Nngh! Both of you! Nnngh! Bibi! Suu-chan! Nnngh! Noooooo!”

<b>

<b>

“What on earth are these kids doing...”

<b>

Colin was wearing a cross-halter bikini made of a fabric with colorful small triangles and zigzag patterns, looking somewhat African (?),

elegantly sitting on a chair with a pareo wrapped around her.

<b>

Under the shade of a beach house made of logs, she was sipping a chilled soft drink with Jessica’s younger sister, Janice, while muttering in disbelief.

<b>

Nuu... Colin. I found out today that she’s a hidden big breast girl! A tear fell an extra drop!

<b>

“W-Who cares! Just let it fall off! Just fall off!!”

“Nyuu! It’s big! It’s big! Guhinn! Something like this! It’s so big!”

“D-Don’t! You can’t take it off! Nnngh! Don’t pinch there... Hinn! Nyuann! Nooooo!”

<b>

The painful cries of Bibi and me, along with Mia’s voice that was either a scream or a moan, echoed amidst the sound of the waves.

It continued until Dana joined in and snatched away my bikini top.

Next time, during summer vacation, a story about when we all went hunting.

"Interlude 2: Let’s Go Hunting!"

I will post it on the 24th at 8 PM next week.
