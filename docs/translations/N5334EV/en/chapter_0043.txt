# Interlude 1 Let's go to the sea!

Story during summer vacation.

So-called "swimsuit times!


----------------

<blank>

Iyafooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! I'm the first one to go!

<blank>

Dana was the first to run toward the surf, her ass shaking in her cherry pink bikini with little fabric.

<blank>

Oh! Dana! You're cheating!"

<blank>

Carla is running toward Dana, who is kicking the sand and heading toward her!　and kicks the sand toward her.

<blank>

Kara's swimsuit is a halter-neck bikini with fine white and lapis lazuli stripes.

He ran straight through Dana's side and blew her away with the impact of his speed.

<blank>

Following Kara, Alicia and Jessica also run into the surf.

<blank>

Alicia also wore this mature white halter-neck dress with a large back and side opening.

Jessica was wearing a black micro bikini that showed off all of her style, and her braids, which usually fell to the sides, were gathered into a bun and pinned to the sides of her head.

The two also run to the surf, basha-basha-basha, and the tide splashes.

<blank>

Sue come quick too!!!!"

<blank>

Kara and the others are calling me from the waves.

<blank>

Dana was blown away, and she dragged her head out of the sand and exhaled loudly with a "phew!

<blank>

It's awful! Kara!"

<blank>

He shouted, spitting sand out of his mouth.

<blank>

The beach is silky and dazzlingly white.

The deep sky blue sky that pierces through the sky and the large white iridescent clouds are the summer sky itself.

The sparkling emerald green sea is still dazzling, and the sound of its waves is pleasant to the ear.

<blank>

Let's go, Sue!"

<blank>

While I was admiring the ocean, Mia, who was standing next to me, called out to me.

<blank>

...... Mia is, mmm, a tube-top bikini with a V-shaped cutout at the bust!

What is that? Won't it spill? No slippage?

Even just a big piece of corrupted meat will be emphasized a lot!

The fabric also has violet-colored stripes and is strangely adult-like and ill-looking!

If they stick out the tip of my nose, I won't be able to take my eyes off them!

<blank>

Still, she involuntarily presses her hand to her chest and feels something she can't accept!

<blank>

'Pressing on now won't change anything!

<blank>

And the insolent thing whispering behind my back!

Turn around and there he is! That's right! It's Bibi!

<blank>

Bibi is wearing a bright peppermint green swimsuit with white polka dots.

It's a cute little dress with a big open back but a small skirt.

Is the big ribbon on the chest the key?

<blank>

Her hair, usually swept back, was pulled into twin tails on either side of her head, and she wore a large straw hat over it.

Bear child is so ladylike!

<blank>

If you're a real lady, you're a real lady if you're a real lady if you're a real lady!

This sandy beach is also a private beach for the Kuroki family.

Here in New Knoxport, where I'm staying, it's another house of the Kuroki family.

She is the daughter of the Kuroki family, one of the three Amcam families!　I said that to her, and she looked at me suspiciously and said, "You say that?　She looked at me suspiciously and said, ......? Why?

<blank>

Well! That's not the issue now, the issue is Behrko's insolent remarks!

In general, there were some things that didn't sit right with me!

<blank>

I'm supposed to be a C. Why is this a B?

<blank>

My swimsuit is a lovely rape blossom colored bikini.

The cut of the V-zone is moderately sharp.

However, the large frills attached to the upper and lower parts emphasize the loveliness rather than the obnoxiousness of the design, and I like it because it is quite dainty.

But the problem is its size.

Yes, the underwear I usually wear is a free size with elasticity, and although it is not clearly stated, it should be a C!

And yet! This swimsuit fits perfectly, but somehow it's a size B! I'm not convinced!

<blank>

What? What are you talking about? You don't even have a C!

What? Ah, a thing! Sh, it's supposed to be a C minus, so it's a C!"

There is no such thing as a C minus! You have a B!

<blank>

Gah-garn! and the drawn letters fell on my head!

<blank>

You're a B! You're a B, B!"

<blank>

I was so excited," said Behrko, placing her left hand on her hip and pointing her right index finger at me.

I put my hands on the ground without any effort. Ah!

<blank>

"Be aware of it! You know you are a B!

"No...even if you fool around with a ribbon like that...it won't change the fact that it's not there! It's still the same, and it's not there!

<blank>

Hagu! and Bibi took a step back, holding his chest with both hands.

<blank>

I have it! I have it!

I have a grip!

"Oh, I can do it, too! I can grab it!

Lies! Bibi is lying, lying, lying!"

<blank>

This time, I stood up and pointed my finger at Bearko!

Objection!

<blank>

I'm not lying! I've got something!

There's no way I can get a hold of it! There's no way I can grab it!

Na, na, na! With B! No, there's no difference! There's not much difference! You're just fooling around with your frills! You're wearing frills too!

Huzzah!"

<blank>

It's there! And there isn't! I can grab it! I can't grab it!　and then me and Bearko went into a teary-eyed mud fight with each other. ......

<blank>

"Huh. Calm down, both of you! Hey? It's nothing to fight about. It's not a big deal. Okay? Let's just calm down, okay?

<blank>

We both stared at the one who had dropped the bomb, with tears in our eyes!　and glared at them.

<blank>

""You! Don't say it. ！！！！"

<blank>

We both grabbed and squeezed the big, flabby, fat piece of meat that was swaying wildly from side to side in front of our eyes at the same time!

<blank>

I'm so excited! Nnnn! N～～～～～nnnggg!

"Woah ～～～～～～～n!"

<blank>

We both cried and rubbed each other!

<blank>

Oh, no! No! Squeeze! Both of you! Bibi-chan! Sue-chan nnnn! Ngguunnnn! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

<blank>

"I wonder what they're doing, these kids..."

<blank>

Colin's swimsuit is designed with colorful little triangles and zigzag patterns in neat rows, something very African (?). It is a cross-halter bikini made of fabric.

He's sitting on a chair in a pareo, looking classy.

<blank>

Under the shade of a beach house made of logs, he and Jessica's sister, Janice, were sipping cold soft drinks in beach chairs, muttering dismissively.

<blank>

Nuh ...... Colin. I just found out today that you have big tits in hiding! One extra tear fell!

<blank>

"This, this! This thing! Burn it off! Burn it off!

I'm so big! Oh, you're big! Big! Guhinnn! Like this, like this! Big ones!

No, no! You can't pick it up! That's right, I'm going to pick it. ...... I'm not allowed to pick it up! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

The sound of my and Bibi's cries of grief and Mia's screams and cries of amusement echoed in between the sounds of the waves.

This continued until Dana joined the fray and took away my bikini top.
