# 204 Episode 204 Warriors of Amkam

Algernon!　Sturgeon!　Lead the two of them!　Get them to meet up with Mr. Ludry and the others who are on their way here!"

<blank>

Beatrice's words are answered sharply by a small animal, which instantly jumps off her shoulders and runs across the ground.

Then, like two white lines on the ground, he followed them and disappeared beyond the trees.

<blank>

Some of the terra-dogs seem to have gone around the outside of the barricade." Are those boys alone okay?"

<blank>

Mia asked Beatrice as she shot out the demonic beasts she saw.

<blank>

No problem!　Algernon knows what's going on around him!　Sturgeon can use my magic through Algernon, so I can use illusion magic to a great extent!　It's impossible for a terra dog to catch him!"

I see. Also at ......."

<blank>

While exchanging words with Beatrice, Mia glanced toward the high ground to the south.

<blank>

I think a couple of them slipped through over there, too, huh?"

That's not the problem!　There's no way she's going to fall behind a terra dog right now!"

...... yeah, right."

What's wrong?"

No, I like you now, Karen. I like you now, Karen.

I know you will!"

Ehehe."

We're just getting started!　I'm going in to cover you!　How bad is it?

"Nah--I'd say we're just under 60% now."

I see!　Then you're good to go!　But keep up the supply!"

I know."

<blank>

They each reach for a leather pouch attached to their waist.

From one of the pouches, he removed a light blue spherical capsule about two centimeters in diameter.

If you quickly throw it into your mouth and bite down on it, a cool, refreshing liquid crackles out from inside.

It suddenly dissolves in the mouth and disappears, and soon the magic power of both of them is slightly restored.

<blank>

If it's possible, why don't I finish him off?"

I'll take care of it!"

<blank>

Mia began moving quickly to secure a direct line of sight.

Beatrice gets ready to use her magic of support on the spot.

<blank>

The enemy is a lowly vampire!　They are not a good opponent to be licked, but they are not as strong and powerful as the old demons!　We can hold them off on our own!"

<blank>

Magic Visualization."

It is an auxiliary magic that visualizes magic power and compensates for sight.

It is a supportive magic that compensates for poor visibility by visually capturing magic power even in poor visibility environments.

Beatrice casts a spell to enhance its vision and hangs it over the party members.

<blank>

What is alarming is its durability!　Its extraordinary resilience will surely be defeated in an endurance battle!　After all, the decisive factor is ......!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Van's black claws are continuously thrust in and out.

Lombardo handles the thrusts of his right hand, which are unleashed at a speed that an ordinary person would not be able to catch, one after another with his battle axe as a shield.

<blank>

The black claws snatch at Lombard's large body, but are unable to inflict any fatal wounds.

Van's mouth twists in irritation at this.

Van pulled his right hand wide in an attempt to deliver a bigger blow.

<blank>

Lombardo, who had been watching the timing, did not miss the slightest opportunity when his arm was pulled back.

The magic seal on the magical armor glows faintly.

Without hesitation, Lombardo slams his short battle-axe into Van's chest.

Though a small swing, its hip-activated swing is a blow with sufficient speed and weight.

The battleaxe that struck him gouged out Van's breastplate, sternum by sternum, in a large gouge.

<blank>

Goha!"

<blank>

Van, who was hit by a heavy blow, spits blood from his mouth unbearably.

Irving's two-handed sword flashes out from the side to pursue it.

The blade slashes through the air in an attempt to cut Van's head off.

But the two-handed sword stopped with a snap before the neck.

<blank>

The black claws of Van's dagger-like right hand caught it.

The wound in his chest, which was originally considered fatal, was already closed and gone. At the same time, magic power was converging in Van's left hand.

<blank>

Irving saw this and quickly moved away, but a pillar of ice the size of a human arm was shot out from the already completed magic circle.

<blank>

Irving was hit by a direct hit and was blown backward.

As if to add insult to injury, a series of icicles are shot out in rapid succession.

Lombardo quickly stands in the way to shield Irving, but his feet sink under the weight of the ice that is continuously being pelted at him.

<blank>

Irving, who stood up immediately, deflected the flying icicles with his two-handed sword, evading them and moving forward to close in on Van.

In the meantime, Van created icicles that covered the entire area one after another.

When the pillars of ice were about to approach, regrouping to crush all the people in the room....

<blank>

Dissolution."

Mia's magic beads are flooded with scarlet light.

At that moment, all the icicles that filled the space dissolved in an instant.

At the same time, the entire surrounding area fills with steam.

<blank>

The Phantom of the Fog

Beatrice used dazzling magic to match.

With Beatrice's magic, the mist stays in place without dissipating for only a short time.

Although the fog restricts vision, capturing the vampire's stagnant magic is easy for party members with compensated magic vision.

This fog then projects illusions toward the adversary.

Van shakes off the phantom that looms in the mist with an abhorrent look on his face.

<blank>

During this time Beatrice was casting healing spells.

The Healing Wind

A pleasant breeze gathers around Irving and Lombardo.

As we watch, the wounds on the two bodies heal.

The poison that had been soberly poisoning the body was neutralized, and its tolerance was also built up.

<blank>

O my God, you are so stupid!"

<blank>

Noticing the clean magic power that Beatrice radiated, Van vigorously extended his black claws like a spear to pierce Beatrice on the spot.

<blank>

I won't let you do it!"

<blank>

But it is smashed by Irving's two-handed sword before it can reach Beatrice.

<blank>

He spun his body and slammed his two-handed sword, which had gained momentum, into Van's side.

However, the blade of the two-handed sword is blocked by Van's arm standing in guard.

The blade rests in the middle of the right arm.

<blank>

I told you your sword is light!"

I know this level won't pass!"

<blank>

Stopping the two-handed sword with his right arm, Van also used his left claw as a dagger and swung it to pierce Irving.

<blank>

There, a popping sound, as if something was being scattered, shook the air around the area and echoed.

In the white darkness, paths to the object open up one after another.

It is an "extended bullet" released by Mia.

Its vicious warhead shoots Van's swinging left claw and gouges out his arm as well.

Irving immediately moves out of Mia's line of fire.

<blank>

C'mon!"

<blank>

Van's arm, which is shot, repairs after the flesh is scraped off, leaving not even a scarred mark.

<blank>

"Tsk."

<blank>

With a small click of her tongue, Mia instantly corrects the deployment of the magic she uses.

Mia waved her fingertips lightly, and the debris around her wrist gathered into a single mass.

<blank>

The Grenade.

The tip of the head is sharp and hard.

It immediately began spinning at high speed and shot out in the direction Mia's finger was pointing.

With a louder burst than before, the shell blows away the fog in the line of fire and reaches its target.

<blank>

Van was thrusting his open left hand forward to block the continuous flying debris.

The "grenade" is shot into the center of his outstretched hand and the hard tip is twisted into it.

At that moment, the flash of an explosion and the sound of a burst echoed around the area.

Van's left arm from the elbow onward had been completely destroyed, exposing a section of flesh where the second arm had been shredded.

<blank>

Van screams in agony at the sudden destruction of his own arm.

But the arm, as if rewinding time, comes back to the remains of the arm where the splattered flesh and blood had been lost.

And just like that, it was restored to its original muscular arm.

<blank>

...... It's probably within the margin of error, but it looks like the site defects will take some time to repair!"

<blank>

Beatrice muttered as she observed the immortal's recovery.

<blank>

At that moment, an earth-shaking vibration was transmitted to them.

At the same time, a sound like something tearing echoes from deep within the trees.

Beatrice casts a wary eye over the area.

<blank>

Kukk, it seems that the physical boundaries are beginning to collapse. Too bad, there's no way out.

<blank>

While Beatrice and the others wondered, Van lifted his mouth in disgust and threw in a few words of his own.

<blank>

I'd say 30 ......, or maybe 40 minutes.　It's nothing compared to Amcam's, but I'd say it's held up pretty well!

"Are you frustrated?　You guys went to a lot of trouble to seal it up. Kukuku......"

Our reinforcements will be here in a few days!　If we can hold them off until then, that's all that matters!"

<blank>

Kukuk!　You are so adorable and strong, aren't you?　This much stuff, the County Knights of Boltusnan can't stop it alone!"

That's why we're calling for reinforcements!"

Don't you see that any reinforcements will only add fuel to the fire?

<blank>

I don't know!"

<blank>

Irving's magical armor glowed and Amber's Wolf Eyes took on a golden hue.

In a single breath, he reached into Van's pocket and drove his dagger-like claw downwards. Then, he quickly clicked Van's jaw with the hilt.

He slashed at Van, who was slightly off-axis, with a turned two-handed sword, slashing him in the upper right corner in an exaggerated manner.

<blank>

The wounds inflicted by the thin golden holiness of the sword's tip cause searing pain in the impure body.

<blank>

With a grunt like a beast's snarl from the back of his throat, Van jumped back again from the spot.

The wound on its chest, made by slashing it diagonally, does not repair with white smoke, unlike the others.

<blank>

"The blow that wounds my flesh!　That technique!　To allow you to exist would be nothing short of blasphemy!"

Any good AMCAM warrior could have done this.

Then I'll go ahead and destroy your entire village!"

"Every word you say reeks of pettiness, doesn't it?"

Fuck you!

<blank>

Van Niven, his brow wrinkled deep and deep, his coal-red eyes burning with hatred, barked up at Irving Haggard and the Amkam warriors.
