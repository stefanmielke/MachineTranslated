# Chapter 204: Warriors of Amukam

"Algernon! Sturgeon! Lead the two of them! Let them join up with Mr. Rudori and the others who are heading this way!"

<b>

At Beatrice's words, the small creatures answered sharply in unison, leaping off her shoulder and dashing to the ground.

Then, drawing two white lines on the ground, they followed the two and disappeared into the trees ahead.

<b>

"Some of the Terra Dogs seem to have gone around the outside of the barricade. Are those kids going to be okay by themselves?"

<b>

While shooting down the magical beasts in sight, Mia asked Beatrice.

<b>

"There's no problem! Algernon is aware of the surrounding situation! Through Algernon, I can supply my magical power to Sturgeon, so he can use illusion magic within a sufficient range! It's impossible for just a Terra Dog to catch them!"

"I see... But..."

<b>

While exchanging words with Beatrice, Mia glanced toward the high ground to the south.

<b>

"It looks like a few have slipped through over there too?"

"That's not a problem! With that kid now, there's no way she could fall behind a Terra Dog!"

"…Yeah, that's true."

"Are you dissatisfied?"

"No, not at all. I really like Karen-chan as she is now."

"Of course you do!"

"Hehe."

"Now it's our turn! I'm going to provide support! How's your stamina?"

"Um... I'm just under 60% right now, I think?"

"Great! Then there's no problem! But make sure to replenish regularly!"

"I got it."

<b>

The two reached for the leather pouches attached to their waists.

From one of the pouches, they took out a spherical capsule about 2 centimeters in diameter, light blue in color.

They quickly tossed it into their mouths and crushed it, releasing a refreshing liquid inside.

It dissolved almost instantly in their mouths, and their magical power recovered slightly.

<b>

"Should I take them down if possible?"

"Leave it to me!"

<b>

Mia quickly began to move to secure a direct line of fire.

Beatrice prepared to cast support magic at that spot.

<b>

"The enemy is low-level vampires! They are not to be underestimated, but compared to seasoned magical beasts, they lack both numbers and strength! We can hold them down just the two of us!"

<b>

"Magic Power Visualization"

This is a support magic that visualizes magical power to enhance sight.

Even in environments with poor visibility, it helps to correct vision by visually capturing magical power.

Beatrice cast this enhancing magic, overlaying it on her party members.

<b>

"What we need to be cautious of is their durability! Their extraordinary recovery ability will definitely overwhelm us in a prolonged battle! The key is...!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

Van's black claws struck in rapid succession.

The thrusts from his right hand, delivered at a speed incomprehensible to ordinary people, were parried one after another by Lombard's battle axe, which he used as a shield.

<b>

The black claws grazed Lombard's large body but failed to inflict any fatal wounds.

This caused Van's mouth to twist in irritation.

Determined to land a significant blow, Van pulled back his right hand dramatically.

<b>

Lombard, who had been waiting for the right moment, did not miss the slight opening created by the retraction of the arm.

The magical seal of his magical armor glowed faintly.

Without hesitation, Lombard struck the battle axe he held short into Van's chest.

Though it was a small swing, it was a blow with sufficient speed and weight.

The battle axe slammed into Van's chest, gouging deeply through his ribcage.

<b>

"Guh!"

<b>

Sent flying by the heavy blow, Van could not help but spit blood from his mouth.

To follow up, Arvin's two-handed sword, which had darted in from the side, slashed through the air aiming for Van's neck.

However, the two-handed sword came to a halt just before reaching the neck.

<b>

Van's black claw, resembling a dagger, intercepted it.

The chest wound that should have been fatal had already closed up and disappeared. At the same time, magical power was converging in Van's left hand.

<b>

Seeing this, Arvin instinctively tried to create distance, but from the already completed magic circle, an ice pillar as thick as a human arm was launched.

<b>

Arvin took the direct hit and was blown backward.

As if to follow up, a series of ice pillars were fired in quick succession.

Lombard immediately stood in front of Arvin to shield him, but the weight of the continuously fired ice forced his feet into the ground.

<b>

Quickly getting back on his feet, Arvin deflected the trajectory of the incoming ice pillars with his two-handed sword and moved forward to approach Van while dodging.

In the meantime, Van continued to produce ice pillars that threatened to fill the entire area.

As the ice pillars surged forward to crush everyone present, suddenly――.

<b>

"Dissolve"

Mia's magical orb overflowed with scarlet light.

In that instant, all the ice pillars that had filled the space melted away in an instant.

Simultaneously, the surrounding area was filled with steam.

<b>

"Fog Illusion"

In sync with this, Beatrice cast a dazzling magic spell.

With Beatrice's magical power, the fog remained in place for a brief moment without dispersing.

Though visibility was limited by the fog, the party members, whose magical sight was enhanced, found it easy to capture the stagnant magical power of the vampire.

And this fog projected illusions toward the adversaries.

As the illusions approached amidst the fog, Van swatted them away with annoyance.

<b>

During this time, Beatrice was chanting healing magic.

"Healing Wind"

A pleasant breeze gathered around Arvin and Lombard.

In no time, the wounds on their bodies began to heal.

The poison that had been subtly corroding their bodies was also neutralized, and they gained resistance to it.

<b>

"You despicable!"

<b>

Noticing Beatrice's pure magical power, Van extended his black claws like a spear, aiming to pierce her.

<b>

"Not on my watch!"

<b>

But before it could reach Beatrice, it was shattered by Arvin's two-handed sword.

<b>

Continuing to rotate his body, he struck the two-handed sword into Van's side.

However, the blade of the two-handed sword was blocked by Van's arm, which was raised in defense.

The blade stopped midway through his right arm.

<b>

"I told you your sword is light!"

"You should know it won't get through with just this much!"

<b>

Van, who stopped the two-handed sword with his right arm, raised his left claw like a dagger, preparing to pierce Arvin.

<b>

At that moment, a bursting sound that seemed to scatter something reverberated through the air.

Paths to the target opened one after another in the white darkness.

It was Mia's "Expansion Bullet."

That vicious projectile shattered Van's raised left claw and gouged into his arm.

Arvin immediately retreated from Mia's line of fire.

<b>

"You bastard!"

<b>

As Van's arm was shot, the flesh was stripped away, but it began to repair itself, leaving no trace of the wound.

<b>

"Tch."

<b>

Mia clicked her tongue softly and quickly adjusted the deployment of her magic.

With a light flick of her fingers, the pebbles around her wrist gathered into a single mass.

<b>

"Throwing Bullet"

The tip was sharpened and hardened.

It immediately began to rotate at high speed and was launched in the direction Mia pointed.

With a louder explosion than before, the projectile blew away the mist in its path and reached its target.

<b>

Van had thrust his open left hand forward to block the series of incoming pebbles.

The "Throwing Bullet" struck the center of his outstretched hand, and the hardened tip twisted into it.

In that instant, the flash of the explosion and the sound of the blast echoed around.

Van's left arm was completely destroyed from the elbow down, exposing the ragged flesh of his upper arm.

<b>

Van let out a cry of anguish upon suddenly having his arm destroyed.

However, the blood and flesh that had scattered returned to the spot where the arm had been lost, as if time were rewinding.

And just like that, it was restored to its original muscular form.

<b>

"…It seems that while it's within the range of error, it takes some time to repair missing limbs!"

<b>

Beatrice murmured while observing the undead's recovery process.

<b>

At that moment, a tremor shook the ground beneath them.

Simultaneously, a sound like something tearing echoed from deep within the trees.

Beatrice cast a wary glance around.

<b>

"Hehe, it seems the physical barrier is starting to crumble. How unfortunate, there’s no turning back now."

<b>

Ignoring the puzzled expressions of Beatrice and the others, Van raised his mouth in a sly grin and spoke with confidence.

<b>

"Thirty... no, perhaps forty minutes? It's nothing compared to what Amukam has, but I must say it held up well!"

"Are you frustrated? After all the trouble you went through to seal it. Hehe..."

"Our reinforcements will arrive soon! If we can hold out until then, that's enough!"

<b>

"Hehe! Such a cute bravado, isn't it? With this amount of force, the Boltsnann's knight brigade alone cannot hold us back!"

"That's why we requested reinforcements!"

"Do you not understand that no matter what reinforcements come, it will be like pouring water on a duck's back?!"

<b>

"Well, who knows about that!"

<b>

Arvin's magical armor shone, and Amber's Wolf Eyes glimmered with gold.

In a single breath, he slipped into Van's range and struck down with his claw-like dagger.

Then, he immediately jabbed Van's jaw with the hilt of his sword.

With Van slightly off balance, he swung his two-handed sword down diagonally from above.

<b>

The blade, wrapped in a thin golden holy aura, inflicted pain that burned into the impure body.

<b>

Letting out a beast-like growl from deep in his throat, Van leaped back from the spot once more.

The diagonal wound on his chest, unlike the others, emitted white smoke and did not heal.

<b>

"That blow that injured my flesh! That technique! Allowing your existence is nothing less than a blasphemy against that person!"

"Anyone who is a proper warrior of Amukam can do this."

"Then I shall destroy your village along with you!"

"Your words reek of desperation, you know?"

"Shut up!!"

<b>

With deep furrows etched into his brow, Van Nivun glared at Arvin Haggard and the warriors of Amukam with eyes burning with hatred like embers.
