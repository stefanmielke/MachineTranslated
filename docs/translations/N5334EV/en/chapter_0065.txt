# 60 Big Laugh of Hulbert East

The sound of hard objects touching each other echoes.

The sound of dry branches being crushed spreads out.

The stagnant atmosphere in the forest stirred and stirred.

<blank>

It is a cursed land where no living plants or trees grow, even though it is deep in the forest. It is a vast space with bare rocks and clods.

There, a lifeless and fearless presence covers the earth and stirs countless times.

<blank>

<blank>

It is a black rock mountain that towers over such a fearless place.

A cave was drilled there.

<blank>

At the far end of the gouged out rock, a single seat was set up.

The chair, which was neither inorganic nor animate, was formed in a shape that could neither be described as bone nor guts, and it was black, pale, and had a slimy sheen.

<blank>

There is a man sitting comfortably in a chair like a throne.

The man's skin was as dusky and scintillating as the chair, his face, covered with long dreadlocks and a black beard, was cynically pouting, and his piercing eyes had a red glow.

His body was unclothed, and his entire body was covered with veins or ivy-like vessels, pulsating as if he had assimilated into the chair.

<blank>

Furthermore, there are three figures clinging to its black throne.

<blank>

From the right side of the throne, a golden blonde woman with white skin and loose, webbed hair shimmers.

The black nightdress she wore was wide open at the chest in a V-shape, and her thighs, peeking out through deeply cut slits, were entwined with the vein tubes extending from the throne.

<blank>

To the left of her is a woman with brown skin and long black hair, also leaning back in her chair.

The body is wrapped in a tight bikini armor made of only strings and a few scraps.

He wears shoulder pads and cuirasses, but it is hard to imagine that his attire will serve any purpose in battle.

The brown-skinned woman moves her face toward the man on the throne, leaning in to get a closer look at him, and then moves her face to his chest.

<blank>

And another. A woman with pale blue skin, slightly pointed ears, and silvery white hair was wearing a black leather bondage.

The leather belt that is tied around his waist barely conceals his secret places, and the rusty chains that hang from his collar and hand and foot restraints make an inorganic sound as he moves around.

The woman threw her body at the foot of the throne and clutched herself to the man's legs.

<blank>

All three had voluptuous and seductive limbs, all had blood-red lips and blurry, twinkling red eyes.

<blank>

The women are in ecstasy as they lovingly run their fingers, lips, and tongues over the body of the man on the throne and over the veins that extend from it.

<blank>

The lewd breathing of the women echoes through the rocks.

<blank>

<blank>

Another red shadow stands before the throne where four such shadows stir.

<blank>

Platinum blonde, like a sparkle, flowing down to the chest.

Her slanted eyes and sky-blue pupils reflected the cold surroundings, and her thick, glossy red lips were knotted shut, showing no emotion.

She wears a garnet dress that is redder than blood. The red highlights her exposed shoulders and the white porcelain skin of her bosom.

<blank>

Soon, those blood-red lips opened and a sweet tone of voice began to speak.

<blank>

"How are you doing, Mr. Hulbert?"

"Oh, Clarimonde. I'm up to the number you asked for."

<blank>

When Clarimonde asked, Halbert replied that there was nothing to worry about. At the same time, the three women turned their sharp eyes on Clarimond.

<blank>

Thank you very much. You have done a marvelous job of getting this many in just over 10 months. Master Rodolphe will be very pleased.

We found several nests of pigs and imps. It seems that we were able to speed up the process somewhat. But we could have taken a little more time. We could have taken at least a year.

<blank>

When Clarimonde quietly leans her head back in a bowing posture, her bosom swayed as if it were about to burst.

Halbert watched it happily with his mouth twisted into a smile.

<blank>

It is only because of the power of Mr. Hulbert."

I don't care if it takes 5 years, 10 years, or even 100 years! What do you think? Clarimond? Kuhahaha!

<blank>

Halbert replies amusedly that he wished he had taken more time.

As if to say, the more time you spend, the more fun you will have.

<blank>

But the three women reacted to Halbert's words by casting abject glances at Clarimonde.

Clarimonde's eyes are cold and her expression is unchanged.

<blank>

"He won't be alive in a hundred years? Kuhaha! ...... No, I wouldn't be surprised if he's still the same after 100 or 200 years...Kuhahahaha!

In any case, it is time to go. Please be ready."

<blank>

Clarimonde quietly turns her gaze to the object on the throne.

The back of the throne was high, and the object protruded upward from the center of the backboard.

<blank>

It is a distorted object with multiple heads intertwined like hungry souls that bare countless needle-like fangs and open their mouths to devour everything in their path.

Clarimonde watched with narrowed eyes as the mouths of some of the objects opened slightly, as if seeking something.

<blank>

The number of bones I can create normally is around 100 a day," he said. Even if I produce a higher level, I can only produce one or two at the most.

<blank>

Halbert moved his right arm, which had been assimilated with the throne.

The vascular tube connecting the arm to the throne is shattered and shredded.

<blank>

But if we connect to the subterranean miasma like this, it will be nearly twice as efficient! Kuhaha! Thanks to you, I'll have to stay connected to this stupid miasma until I stop creating! I've been bored out of my mind! Kuhahaha! ......, but you came sooner than I thought you would, didn't you? Huh?

<blank>

He also pulls off his left arm, grabs the armrest with both hands, pushes it, and moves his upper body away from the backrest as well.

Bikibiki, bakiri, bakiri, and the vascular system is torn to shreds.

With each step away from the throne, Halbert's skin returns to its original sallow blackness.

The women let out happy exhales and watched Halbert as he tried to leave the throne.

<blank>

Yes, the snow melted early this year.

I've heard that ...... is the way to go. I don't know what the climate is like around here!"

Perhaps in a week we'll reach this close to ......."

I'm like, "Kuhahaha, that's good, that's good! I can finally move my body!"

<blank>

With his free arms, Halbert pulls the women on either side of him into a shoulder hug and pats their heads.

The tubular veins that had been entangled in both legs were also shattered with a snap.

Halbert stands up, tearing the remaining tubular veins extending from his body.

<blank>

I will follow your instructions as planned.

I'll take care of it! Kuha hachi! Marina! Come on! It's a booster! I'm gonna use it! Entertain us! Kuha ha ha ha!

"Ha, hi! Thank you very much...Mr. Halbert! Ah!

<blank>

Standing up, Halbert grabs the tied up silvery white hair of the woman called Marina who is standing by his feet, lifts her up to his face level, and takes her lips.

The chains hanging from her body are intertwined and make a violent sound as the woman lets out a painful and sad breath.

<blank>

"I'm looking forward to it, eh? It's Clarimonde?

<blank>

Halbert looks down at Clarimond from the step with the throne and happily throws in a few words.

His hands shredded the bondage belt that encircled Marina's body, exposing her lush twin dunes.

<blank>

Halbert's long, sharp fingernails thrust deep to grip one of the pale blue tassels.

Marina screams and screams.

One after another, the black leather is torn off by Halbert, leaving only a small residue of the belt on his body.

<blank>

Marina sobs as Halbert scratches her from behind.

<blank>

Halbert then plunged his fangs deep into Marina's neck.

Marina's high-pitched cry echoes through the rock.

<blank>

Hey? What kind of squeal is my reward? Huh? I'm looking forward to it, Clarimonde! Kuhahahaha!"

<blank>

Halbert still played with and violated Marina's body, happily telling Clarimonde, "I'm going to do it again.

<blank>

Clarimonde's expression did not move, but her eyes were quiet and she murmured, "As you wish.

<blank>

The two women by the throne glare at Clarimonde hatefully.

<blank>

I like it! That's good! Kuha-ha-ha! Kuhahaha! Kwahahahahahahahahahaha!

<blank>

The interrupted screams and cries of the marinas rise and fall, and Halbert's loud laughter echoes through the rock as the intertwining chains make a rhythmic sound.

<blank>

The air outside the rock vibrates in response.

Lamentations that seem to rise from the depths of the earth tremble and echo.

All the non-living people gathered there were voiceless.

<blank>

Both those who wear flesh and those who do not wear flesh light a grudge in their eyes, and a crimson fire with no warmth illuminates the area.

<blank>

The vindictiveness of more than 10,000 immortal soldiers shakes the lifeless earth and shakes the atmosphere.

That day, the depths of the Great Forest of Irosio were buried under the curse of the departed.

Next "A Visit from Marsh Cowsbert"

<blank>

Thank you for reading.

<blank>

There is no postcard SS this time.

I apologize to those who are looking forward to it, but I didn't want to include it in this installment because of the atmosphere (´д`ι).

We will make sure to include it next time! <(_ _ _)>
