# Episode 60: The Laughter of Halbert East

The sound of hard objects clashing echoes, katari, katari.

The sound of dry branches cracking spreads, pakiri, pakiri.

The stagnant atmosphere in the forest stirs, zawari, zawari.

<b>

It is a cursed land where no living grass or trees grow, deep in the forest. A vast space with exposed rocks and clods of earth.

There, a horrifying presence that gives no sense of life writhes, covering the ground.

<b>

<b>

It is a black rocky mountain towering as if looking down upon such a dreadful place.

There is a single cave pierced into it.

<b>

At the innermost part of the gouged rock, a seat was placed.

That chair, difficult to discern as either inorganic or organic, was shaped like bones or entrails, radiating a dark, oily sheen.

<b>

A man sits there, majestically like a throne.

His skin is as dark and oily as the chair, and his face, covered with long dreadlocks and a black beard, curls into a cynical smile, with sharp eyes glowing red.

His body is unclothed, covered in vascular tubes resembling blood vessels or vines, pulsating as if he is one with the chair.

<b>

Furthermore, there are three figures clinging to that black throne.

<b>

On the right side of the throne, a woman with white skin and loosely webbed golden blonde hair droops languidly.

The black night dress she wears is cut deeply in a V shape at the chest, and her thigh, peeked through a deep slit, intertwines with the vascular tubes extending from the throne.

<b>

On the left side of the seat, there is a woman with brown skin and long black hair swaying, also snuggling against the chair.

She is clad in a daring bikini armor made of strings and a few scraps.

Though she wears shoulder pads and gauntlets, it is hard to believe that this outfit serves any purpose on the battlefield.

The brown-skinned woman leans closer to the man on the throne, trying to increase her closeness, bringing her face closer to his chest.

<b>

And another one. A woman with pale blue skin and slightly pointed ears, her silver hair tied up, is clad in black leather bondage.

A leather belt tightened as if to restrain her barely covers her private parts, and the red rusted, rugged chains hanging from her collar and restraints make a mechanical sound with every movement.

The woman throws her body at the foot of the throne, clinging to the man's legs.

<b>

All three possess voluptuous and alluring bodies, each with blood-red lips and hazy crimson eyes.

<b>

The women caress the man on the throne, the vascular tubes extending from him, lovingly tracing their fingers, lips, and tongues, wearing expressions of ecstasy.

<b>

The lascivious breaths of the women echo within the rock.

<b>

<b>

Before the writhing throne, there stands another red shadow.

<b>

Flowing to her chest, shining platinum blonde.

Her elongated eyes and sky-blue pupils reflect the surroundings coldly, and her thick, glossy red lips are sealed without showing any emotion.

She wears a garnet dress redder than blood, which accentuates her exposed shoulders and the porcelain skin of her overflowing chest.

<b>

Eventually, those blood-red lips part, and a sweet voice begins to weave words.

<b>

"Lord Halbert, how are you?"

"Oh, Clarimond. For now, the numbers you mentioned have increased."

<b>

In response to Clarimond's inquiry, Halbert answers nonchalantly. At the same time, the three women direct sharp gazes at Clarimond.

<b>

"Thank you! To gather this number in just over ten months... as expected of you. Lord Rodulf will also be pleased."

"I found several nests of pigs and goblins. Thanks to that, it seems to have progressed a bit faster. Though, I would have preferred to take a bit more time. At least a year, you know?"

<b>

As Clarimond quietly leans forward in a gesture of gratitude, her chest swells enticingly.

Halbert watches with a twisted smile, enjoying the sight.

<b>

"That's all thanks to your power, Lord Halbert."

"I wouldn't mind taking five years, ten years, or even a hundred years! Right? Clarimond?! Kuha ha!"

<b>

Halbert responds cheerfully, saying he would have preferred to take more time.

As if to say that the longer it takes, the more enjoyment there is to be had.

<b>

However, the three women react to Halbert's words, casting resentful glances at Clarimond.

Clarimond's gaze remains cold, and her expression unchanged.

<b>

"After all, in a hundred years, that guy won't be alive, right? Kuha! ...No, it wouldn't be surprising if he remained the same even after a hundred or two hundred years... Kuha ha ha!"

"Either way, it's time. Please prepare."

<b>

Clarimond quietly turns her gaze to the object on the throne.

The backrest of the throne is high, and the object protrudes upward from the center of the backrest.

<b>

It is a grotesque object with numerous fang-like spikes exposed, resembling a hungry spirit's head with multiple mouths opening as if to devour everything.

Clarimond squints as she watches some of the mouths slightly open, as if seeking something.

<b>

"I can normally create about 100 skeletons a day at best. Even for higher-tier ones, at most 1 or 2."

<b>

Halbert moves his right arm, which had merged with the throne.

Pakiri, pakiri, the vascular tubes connecting his arm to the throne snap like breaking twigs.

<b>

"But by connecting like this to the miasma underground, the efficiency nearly doubles! Kuha! However, until I stop creating, I have to remain connected to this damned miasma! I've been getting bored not being able to move! Kuha ha! ...But hey, didn't you come a bit earlier than I thought? Huh?"

<b>

He further tears off his left arm, pushing against the armrests with both hands, pulling his upper body away from the backrest.

Bikibiki, bakiri, the vascular tubes are ripped apart.

As Halbert distances himself from the throne, his skin returns to its original dark hue.

The women let out pleased sighs, watching Halbert as he tries to separate from the throne.

<b>

"Yes, this year the snow melted early."

"…It seems so. I don't really understand the climate around here!"

"Perhaps in about a week, it will reach this vicinity..."

"Kuha ha! That's good, that's good!! Finally, I can move my body!"

<b>

Halbert pulls the women on either side closer, wrapping his arms around them and stroking their heads with his now freed arms.

The vascular tubes that had entwined around his legs also snap with a crack.

Halbert stands up, tearing away the remaining vascular tubes from his body.

<b>

"As planned, please take care of it."

"Leave it to me! Kuha ha! Marina! Come here! Let's get this party started! I'll use you! Make it fun for me! Kuha ha!!"

"Y-Yes! Thank you... Lord Halbert! Ah!"

<b>

Halbert, now standing, grabs the silver-haired woman called Marina by her tied-up hair and lifts her to his face level, stealing a kiss.

As the chains hanging from her body intertwine and make a loud noise, the woman lets out a breath that is both painful and longing.

<b>

"I'm looking forward to it, huh? Clarimond?!"

<b>

Halbert looks down at Clarimond from the step where the throne is, throwing words at her cheerfully.

His hand tears away the bondage belt wrapping around Marina's body, exposing her ample bosom.

<b>

Halbert's long, sharp fingernails plunge deep as if to crush one of the pale blue locks.

Marina lets out a sound that is neither a scream nor a moan.

One after another, Halbert tears away the black leather from her body, leaving only remnants of the belt.

<b>

Marina, embraced from behind by Halbert, lets out sobs.

<b>

Halbert further sinks his fangs deep into Marina's neck.

Marina's high-pitched scream echoes throughout the rock.

<b>

"Hey? What kind of cries will my reward give me? Huh? I'm looking forward to it, Clarimond! Kuha ha ha!"

<b>

Halbert continues to toy with and violate Marina's body while cheerfully speaking to Clarimond.

<b>

Clarimond, without changing her expression, quietly murmurs, "As you wish."

<b>

The two women beside the throne glare at Clarimond with hatred.

<b>

"That's good! That's good! Kuha! Kuha ha!! Kuha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!"

<b>

Amidst the intermittent screams and moans of Marina, the intertwining chains create a rhythmic sound, while Halbert's laughter echoes throughout the rock.

<b>

In response, the air outside the rock vibrates.

A wailing cry rises from the depths of the earth, shaking and resonating.

All the beings that are not alive gathered there emitted voiceless sounds.

<b>

Those clad in flesh and those without, their double pupils lit with vengeful fire, the crimson flames devoid of warmth illuminate the surroundings.

<b>

The grievances raised by over ten thousand immortal vanguards shake the lifeless earth and tremble the atmosphere.

That day, the depths of the Iroshio Great Forest were buried in the curses of the dead.

Thank you for reading.

This time, there is no afterword SS.

I apologize to those who were looking forward to it, but I didn't want to include it in this chapter due to the atmosphere (´д`ι)

I will make sure to include it next time, so please look forward to it! <(_ _)>
