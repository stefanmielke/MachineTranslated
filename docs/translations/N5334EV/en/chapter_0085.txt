# Interlude 1: The brave man tells his story.

Episode #1, which I meant to include in the last episode but left out due to disconnection.

<blank>

Don't move."

<blank>

Aria Blouk held the blade of her tomahawk to Cedric Meyer's throat and quietly announced in a low voice.

<blank>

Aria? What are you doing to the battalion commander?!"

You, too, please be quiet.

<blank>

Luke Trevor shouted out at Aria's sudden and almost heinous behavior, but the blade of the knife held by Annemarie Bairos was still pressed tightly against his throat.

Another, Casey Guinness, is silently pressed against the throat by Millie Barrett, who stands behind him.

<blank>

<blank>

That day, the day after the army of the undead was defeated.

After sending off the advance party returning to the village, while the main body was getting ready to leave, Team Aria called for a meeting to prepare for departure, and as the three entered the hastily prepared tent, Aria thrust a tomahawk blade at Cedric.

<blank>

You know what we're talking about.

"...... her, right?"

<blank>

Aria's eyes give a quiet affirmation.

<blank>

She? I didn't expect her to be ......"

Please be quiet.

<blank>

AnnaMarie presses the blade of the knife against Luke's throat, who screams as quickly as he can.

<blank>

You are not to talk about her. At the very least, we cannot ask you to report it to the King's Council."

I understand what you are saying, but isn't it more difficult for someone with that much power to stay out of the public eye? But isn't it more difficult for someone with that much power to stay out of the public eye for so long?"

I'm aware of that."

You can't put a door in anyone's mouth. In fact, we had heard of her reputation before we came here.

<blank>

Cedric is unfazed by the blade thrust at him by Aria, and answers her with a quiet look in his eyes.

<blank>

Not many people here today realize what she's capable of.

"The healing power of a single man, rivaling that of a large medical team. And the boldness to take on an army of thousands single-handedly, and the ability to match it. ......"

"............"

It is truly the return of the legend of the hero."

<blank>

Cedric's words are pierced by the spirit of the women of Amcam.

Luke, however, is excited by the word "brave.

<blank>

'Nah, then! Shouldn't the state protect her as soon as possible? That's exactly what she ......"

'That's exactly what it is! I say it's none of your business!!!!"

<blank>

Aria interrupts Luke's words, his anger quietly and strongly overflowing.

<blank>

Do you people think that the bond between the head and the girl is a temporary one?"

But! That power can save a country ...... and many peoples!"

'You're willing to cut that off for the sake of your country? You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

AnnaMarie stepped backward with the knife pressed against Luke, who was drunk and stifled by the rage that was spewing from Aria.

<blank>

............ will echo across the country someday."

But that's not now."

<blank>

Cedric quietly tells Aria, to which Aria also quietly replies.

<blank>

A few years should be enough. ......"

"............, that's what you said."

That's what I'm saying.

<blank>

Cedric looked back into Aria's eyes, as if to say he got the point.

<blank>

A brave man once appeared in this country, separated from his foster parents, and continued to fight for his country alone.

He was not allowed to speak of his origins, and he was never returned to his foster family for the rest of his life.

It is a pathetic story of a young man who was feted as a hero and taken in by his country.

However, they do not intend to allow any such sad stories in the future.

<blank>

"Before I do that, I'm going to make a name for myself or ......"

<blank>

Cedric cowered his shoulders and raised the corners of his mouth as if to say, "I see.

<blank>

I am the proud owner of the "Cedric Meyer"! This Cedric Meyer, my knightly pride at stake: ......"

No need for such pride!

<blank>

Aria interrupted Cedric.

<blank>

The pride of a knight means nothing here. Swear to what you think you can believe in here! Swear to what you think you must swear!"

<blank>

For a moment, Cedric's eyes widen at Aria's denial of his knightly pride.

Luke and Casey also try to protest against Aria's words, but are restrained from moving from behind.

Cedric, however, immediately exhales a small breath and speaks in self-mockery.

<blank>

It is true that we were helpless here. It is absurd to speak of 'knightly pride' to you. ......

Battalion Chief, ......."

<blank>

Luke muttered huskily.

<blank>

"Then ......, to our brothers who lost their lives here, to Sir Cloud and the other three who risked their lives to protect us, and to our young Savior, I pledge! And to our young Savior, I swear it! We will never forget this debt of gratitude! And that we will never repay you for your kindness!

<blank>

Aria looks at Meyer from the front, who declares in high spirits, and Aria, recognizing his stagnant eyes, quietly brings down the tomahawk.

Following suit, Millie and AnnaMarie took their knives away from them and stepped back.

<blank>

The tension that had filled the tent up to that point quietly receded like the tide.

<blank>

How serious were you?"

Everywhere!"

<blank>

Meyer's words, which seem to probe Aria's true intentions, are answered by Aria in a matter-of-fact manner.

<blank>

Worst case scenario is that the entire expedition to Irosio fails. ......

That's ......."

<blank>

Luke looked at him and swallowed hard.

<blank>

It is the village's resolve. ...... But if we do that, we will be violating the will of the head minister and the wishes of that child."

<blank>

Because no one wants that. ......, Aria muttered as she looked into the void.

<blank>

Thank God you're a man of understanding."

<blank>

And a smile of heartfelt happiness, Aria turned to Meyer.

<blank>

I am always ready to reap what I can ......

<blank>

As she said this, AnnaMarie moved her five fingers briefly and fingered the handles of the four knives, four at a time, which flew back from wherever they had appeared. Then she crossed the knives, which had become like eight fingernails, in front of her face.

<blank>

Luke sees this and steps back, his face turning pale, and for some reason Millie steps back with him, her face also turning pale.

<blank>

You guys okay with that?"

<blank>

Cedric Meyer looks around at Luke and Casey to confirm their intentions.

Luke faced Aria and the others head-on and put his hand on his chest.

<blank>

Of course, I also swear an oath! I pledge allegiance and loyalty to you who have protected our people and to the goddesses who have protected and guided us to this point!

<blank>

Buh! and somehow Aria was damaged.

Seeing that, something funny?　The foolish man asks Aria with his eyes.

<blank>

Aria wondered, "What are goddesses? She turned her hand to Luke and shook her head, saying that it was nothing, while muttering with her cheeks slightly stained .......

<blank>

Oh, um! Let me thank you, once again, myself!"

<blank>

Then Casey spoke up.

<blank>

Thank you for saving everyone! Thank you for saving everyone in the squad, the squad leader ......, and squad leader Raisa!"

<blank>

Casey took the opportunity to bow deeply and really ...... really ...... Raisa!　I repeat.

Drops continue to fall at his feet.

Aria gently patted Casey on the shoulder as he turned over.

<blank>

Immediately Aria turned around and looked at Cedric as if to say, "Yes.

<blank>

The head wants me to give you a message.

"A message? For me?"

Yes, to you. To Sir Reinwald Kleiner. ...... 'please'."

'............ phase understood. Cedric Meyer here! Sir Cloud's message is confirmed!

<blank>

Outside the tent, the hustle and bustle of hurried preparations for departure grew louder.

The voice of Fred Loring, the maintenance supervisor, searching for Cedric echoes through the air, and Suzy can be heard calling for Aria and AnnaMarie.

<blank>

Aria and Cedric looked into each other's eyes and lightly clenched their fists together, the corners of their mouths slightly raised, and each returned to those outside the tent who called them.
