# Interlude 1: The Hero's Message

An episode that was intended to be included in the final chapter but was omitted during decluttering.

----------------

<b>

"Don't move."

<b>

Aria Blauk pressed the blade of a tomahawk against Cedric Meyer’s throat and quietly warned him in a low voice.

<b>

"Aria?! What do you intend to do to the captain?!"

"Please be quiet as well."

<b>

Luke Trevor raised his voice in response to Aria's sudden and violent action, but once again, a knife blade held by Annemarie Byros was pressed firmly against his throat.

And another person, Millie Barrett, silently pressed a knife against Casey Guinness's throat from behind.

<b>

<b>

The day after repelling the undead army.

After sending out the advance team to return to the village, while preparing for the main force's departure, the three were called into a hastily set up tent for a meeting regarding Team Aria's departure, at which point Aria had pressed the tomahawk blade against Cedric.

<b>

"You should understand what we want to say."

"…It's about her, isn't it?"

<b>

Aria's eyes quietly indicated affirmation.

<b>

"Her?! You can't mean…"

"Please be quiet."

<b>

Annemarie pressed the knife blade against Luke's throat as he instinctively raised his voice.

<b>

"Do not speak of that child. At the very least, we cannot allow it to be reported to the royal council."

"I understand what you want to say. However, isn't it more difficult for someone with that much power to remain hidden forever?"

"I am well aware of that."

"You cannot shut people's mouths. In fact, we have heard of her reputation before coming here."

<b>

Cedric answered Aria with a calm gaze, undeterred by the blade pressed against him.

<b>

"Very few here are aware of that child's true abilities."

"She possesses healing powers that rival a large medical team all by herself. The courage to challenge thousands of troops alone, and the strength to match it…"

"…………"

"It is truly a resurgence of the hero's legend."

<b>

Cedric's words pierced the spirits of the women of Amukam.

But Luke was stirred by the word "hero."

<b>

"Then! Shouldn't the country protect her as soon as possible? That would be her…"

"That would be! An unnecessary burden!!"

<b>

Aria interrupted Luke's words, her anger quietly but strongly overflowing.

<b>

"Do you think your bond with the chief and that child is merely a temporary one?"

"But! That power could save the country… and many people!"

"Are you saying you wouldn't hesitate to sever it for the sake of the country? Don't be ridiculous!!"

<b>

Overwhelmed by the anger emanating from Aria, Luke fell silent, and Annemarie stepped back a step while still pressing the knife against him.

<b>

"…………It will eventually resonate throughout the country."

"But that is not now."

<b>

Cedric quietly told Aria, and Aria quietly replied in turn.

<b>

"A few years will be enough…"

"…………I see."

"That's what I mean."

<b>

Cedric looked back at Aria, as if to say he understood.

<b>

Once, the hero who appeared in this country was separated from their foster parents and fought alone for the country.

Their origins were not to be spoken of, and it is said they could never return to their foster parents for the rest of their life.

It is a pitiful tale of a young person who was elevated as a hero and absorbed by the country.

However, it seems they have no intention of allowing such a tragic story to happen again.

<b>

"Before that, should we make a name for ourselves…"

<b>

Cedric shrugged and raised the corners of his mouth as if to say he understood.

<b>

"Very well! I, Cedric Meyer, will stake my knightly pride on it…"

"Such pride is unnecessary!!"

<b>

Aria interrupted Cedric's words.

<b>

"The pride of a 'knight' has no meaning here. You must swear to what you believe in! To what you think is worthy of your oath!"

<b>

Cedric widened his eyes at Aria, who denied the pride of a knight for a moment.

Luke and Casey also tried to protest against Aria's words, but they were held back from behind and could not move.

However, Cedric soon let out a small sigh and spoke with a self-deprecating tone.

<b>

"Indeed, we were utterly powerless here. To speak of 'knightly pride' in front of you is truly foolish…"

"Captain…"

<b>

Luke muttered in frustration.

<b>

"Then… I swear to the comrades who lost their lives here in regret and to the three lords, including Lord Cloud, who protected us with their lives! And to the young savior! We will never forget this gratitude! We will never repay that kindness with malice!!"

<b>

As Meyer declared loudly, Aria looked straight at him, and recognizing the clarity in his eyes, she quietly lowered the tomahawk.

Following her lead, Millie and Annemarie also stepped back, releasing their knives.

<b>

The tension that had filled the tent until then quietly receded like the tide.

<b>

"How serious were you?"

"As serious as it gets!"

<b>

In response to Meyer's probing words about Aria's true intentions, Aria replied casually.

<b>

"At worst, even if the entire investigation team fails in the expedition to Iroshio…"

"Th-That is…"

<b>

Luke's eyes widened, and he swallowed hard.

<b>

"That is merely the village's resolve… But if we were to do such a thing, it would disregard the chief's will and that child's feelings."

<b>

Because no one wishes for that… Aria murmured while gazing into the void.

<b>

"I'm glad you're a man who understands."

<b>

With a genuinely happy smile, Aria turned to Meyer.

<b>

"I am always ready to reap at any time…"

<b>

As she said this, Annemarie moved her fingers briefly, and from somewhere, four knives flew back to her, which she pinched between her fingers. She crossed the eight knives, resembling claws, in front of her face.

<b>

Seeing this, Luke took a step back, his face paling, and for some reason, Millie also stepped back with a pale face.

<b>

"Is that alright with you too?"

<b>

Cedric Meyer looked around at Luke and Casey, confirming their intentions.

Luke faced Aria and the others directly, placing his hand on his chest.

<b>

"Of course, I swear as well! To all those who protected our comrades and to the goddesses who have guided us this far, I pledge my loyalty and oath!!"

<b>

Buhuu!! For some reason, Aria took damage.

Seeing this, the foolish man asked Aria with his eyes if something strange had happened.

<b>

Aria murmured, What do you mean by goddesses! "Goddesses"… and slightly blushed, shaking her head and gesturing to Luke that it was nothing.

<b>

"Um, let me express my gratitude again!!"

<b>

At that moment, Casey raised her voice.

<b>

"Thank you for saving everyone! For saving the whole team, the captain… for saving Captain Lysa, thank you so much!!"

<b>

Casey bowed deeply at that spot, repeatedly saying, Really… really… Lysa…!

Drops continued to fall at her feet.

Aria gently patted Casey's shoulder as she looked down.

<b>

Immediately, Aria turned back, as if to say, "That's right," and faced Cedric.

<b>

"The chief wants to send you a message."

"A message? To me?"

"Yes, to you. To Lord Reinbart Kreiner. …'Please.'"

"…………Understood. I, Cedric Meyer, have received Lord Cloud's message clearly!!"

<b>

Outside the tent, the noise of preparations for departure was growing louder.

The voice of the maintenance chief, Fred Rolling, echoed as he searched for Cedric, and Suzy's voice calling for Aria and Annemarie could be heard.

<b>

Aria and Cedric exchanged glances, slightly raising the corners of their mouths as they lightly bumped fists, then returned to their respective callers outside the tent.

I wonder if I can manage one more story within the year…
