# Chapter 17: Suzy and the Cloud Family's Morning

What was prepared today was a light young grass-colored dress.

<b>

Is it a different color from yesterday's? No, the skirt has pleats and is a bit puffier.

It also has frills at the hem.

Why does just having frills lift my spirits a little?

<b>

While thinking about such things, I finished changing.

<b>

I tried to tie my hair like I had it done yesterday.

<b>

I was worried if I could do it well since it was my first time.

I felt a little nervous as I headed to the living room, wondering if it looked strange, and greeted Sonia and Elrose who were there.

<b>

The two returned my greeting with gentle smiles.

<b>

Breakfast was last night's deer tongue stew and an omelet with cheese.

While helping to set the table, I waited for Howard to come to the dining room.

Everyone gathered around the table and had breakfast together.

<b>

Why does a fluffy omelet make me so happy?

Watching Suzy eat happily, the adults spent the morning feeling warm inside.

<b>

When I offered to help with the breakfast cleanup, Suzy was assigned the washing up.

After washing everything without breaking any dishes, I was called by Howard.

<b>

He said that we needed to dispose of the magical beasts we had cleaned up yesterday, and he wanted me to accompany him for inspection.

He mentioned that he would return by tea time and asked if I would like to have lunch outside together.

<b>

<b>

Sonia soon came with a large basket, saying it was lunch for two.

Elrose also handed me a container like a thermos, saying, "It's warm soup, so please be careful when drinking it."

When Suzy heard that the basket contained deer meat cutlet sandwiches and bacon and vegetable sandwiches, her excitement soared, her cheeks flushed, and she let out a "Whoa!"

<b>

Realizing it, she looked up but noticed the warm gazes of the adults looking at her, which made her cheeks flush even more.

<b>

Taking her flushed face as a sign of approval, Howard told Suzy to wait while he prepared the carriage and went outside.

<b>

While waiting for Howard, Sonia brought Suzy an apron and a hat.

<b>

The apron was white, long, with thick shoulder straps crossing at the back.

It had plenty of gathers and covered the waist area, revealing the frills of the skirt.

The waist ties were wide and long, wrapping around the waist and tying into a large bow at the back.

<b>

The hat was a white straw hat, with a black ribbon wrapped around the brim and the headband.

The large black ribbon at the back was particularly eye-catching.

<b>

Sonia and Elrose seemed satisfied with the finished outfit.

<b>

Suzy appeared a bit embarrassed, but while blushing, she was checking herself in the mirror from various angles, so she must have liked it quite a bit.

<b>

Eventually, Howard came to call Suzy, saying he was ready.

Sonia and Elrose brought Suzy to Howard to show off their work.

Upon seeing Suzy's finished look, Howard let out a "Wow" in admiration and relaxed his cheeks.

Suzy turned red and looked down.

<b>

Shall we go? Howard escorted Suzy into the carriage.

<b>

Sonia said, "Have a good time," and placed the basket on Suzy's lap in the carriage.

"I'm off," Suzy waved to Sonia and Elrose.

<b>

Waving back, the two saw them off as the carriage left the Cloud residence.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The carriage followed the same path as yesterday, heading north, so Suzy was seeing the scenery she had seen yesterday again, but since it was the opposite view, she felt a different freshness.

<b>

She felt it, but while pressing her hands against her still slightly red cheeks...

<b>

(How strange... Was I the type to show my feelings so easily? I thought I was more thick-skinned... This is like being a teenager! Ah! I was a girl in puberty... Damn it!!!)

<b>

She was internally writhing in embarrassment.

<b>

To hide her inner embarrassment, Suzy kept talking to Howard.

<b>

How long ago were those tree-lined paths planted? They are so neatly arranged that the person who planted and maintained them must have been very meticulous, right? If they planned for it to look like this before planting, they must have been someone who could think long-term. I think someone who makes such long-term plans must be a strict person.

<b>

Why is that Hodgeson Pond called a pond when it looks like a lake? The water is a beautiful light blue or green, so they must be carefully managing the water quality, which means they are probably someone who pays attention to many details. I think they must enjoy boating or fishing with their family at that lake on weekends, making their family happy too.

<b>

And so, she spun out trivial thoughts in her clumsy words.

<b>

To Suzy's words, Howard replied,

<b>

That might be one way to think about it. I’ll look into it next time. I don’t know about that, but I’ll ask when we meet again. I’ve never thought about it that way. Suzy has an interesting perspective.

<b>

He received Suzy's words straight without dismissing them and enjoyed the conversation happily.

<b>

What started as a trivial conversation to hide her embarrassment gradually turned into Suzy genuinely enjoying the act of chatting with Howard.

<b>

<b>

When they arrived at the entrance of the forest, unlike yesterday, today they drove straight into the woods.

<b>

<b>

"I marked this spot yesterday so that I could find my way back if something happened," Howard said, but Suzy's expression became a bit complicated at the words "if something happened."

<b>

"Thanks to that, I was able to meet you, Suzy."

<b>

As Howard continued with a smile, Suzy's expression remained complex, but she showed a slightly happy look.

<b>

<b>

In the clearing in the forest, besides Howard and the others, there were about three carriages parked.

<b>

Two of them had large cargo beds and already had a boar's carcass loaded onto them.

<b>

"Good morning, Howard. Thank you for coming. I've been waiting for you."

"Good morning, August. You were already here, as always, quick with your work."

"I received word from the temple yesterday, so I was able to prepare first thing in the morning."

"Suzy, come here. Let me introduce you. This is August Dales, the village chief."

"...Is this child...?"

<b>

Howard nodded.

<b>

Suzy was surprised by the word "village chief," but quickly...

<b>

"Nice to meet you... I'm Suzy..."

<b>

She introduced herself.

<b>

August appeared to be a stout gentleman.

<b>

His protruding belly was likely muscle rather than fat.

The hairy arms that emerged from his rolled-up sleeves conveyed strength covered in muscle.

He had neatly trimmed brownish hair and a clean appearance.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, Suzy. I am August Dales, just introduced. I serve as the village chief."

<b>

August returned the greeting with a politeness that seemed uncharacteristic for a young girl.

<b>

"Chief!!"

<b>

One of the men stacking the boar's body in the carriage called out to him.

<b>

"You've come! As expected of the chief! You cut that two-headed boar cleanly in one stroke! No one in this village could do that!"

<b>

A large man with black hair and a mustache approached Howard, looking very pleased.

<b>

"Is that so? There are plenty of others who could cut it too."

<b>

Howard replied a bit awkwardly.

<b>

"No, no! Certainly, Bart from the Haggard family could do it with one hand. There are others who could cut it, but..."

<b>

He pointed to the cart with his thumb.

<b>

"Only the chief could cut it so beautifully!"

<b>

Suzy turned to look at the cart, asking Howard with her eyes if she could see.

<b>

When Howard nodded, she smiled and quickly ran over to the cart.

Suzy was asking the boy who was helping with the unloading something.

<b>

"Ah... Who is that young lady?"

<b>

The man just noticed and asked Howard.

<b>

"She's my companion, Frank. I'll introduce her later."

<b>

Howard replied while keeping his gaze on Suzy.

<b>

"...The chief's? ...I see, but still!"

<b>

He slightly clouded his expression but quickly changed the subject.

<b>

"The boar was impressive, but that gray wolf!! I can't even describe that cut! Right, August!!"

"Yes! I've never seen such a smooth cut!"

"Exactly! The fur was cleanly severed to the very tips! What kind of sword and cutting technique would create such a beautiful cut?!"

<b>

He continued to excitedly talk about it.

<b>

"Well, it was this sword that cut it," Howard lightly tapped the longsword hanging at his waist.

<b>

"Oh! As expected! What kind of maintenance do you usually do?" the two asked excitedly.

<b>

"But it was that girl who cut the wolf."

<b>

With a mischievous grin, he pointed to Suzy with his eyes.

<b>

"...What!!!"

<b>

The two were left speechless.

<b>

"When I close my eyes, I can immediately recall the sword flash from that time. The beautiful strike that came from a relaxed body. That is something I cannot forget."

"Is that! Is that true, Chief!!!"

"Then, it really is... true?! H-Howard! That girl really...?!"

<b>

<b>

"Leader! Long Leader!!"

<b>

While the two were excited, a young man entered the clearing from deeper in the forest.

<b>

"Oh? What is it, Fred?"

"I just looked around as you told me... but there were more wolf carcasses."

"What?!"

<b>

The men raised their voices.

<b>

"Indeed, there were still others...!"

"There are a total of ten. It would be impossible for just the three of us to carry them all at once, so I came back to report."

".........What?!"

<b>

The three men were left speechless.

<b>

"...I see, I suspected from the beginning... Hehe."

"H-Harold...?"

"Fred! What happened to the other two?"

"Randolph and Rufino are still searching the area to see if there are any more."

"Suzy! Could you come over here for a moment?"

<b>

Howard called Suzy over.

Suzy thanked the boy she had been talking to at the cart and quickly ran back to Howard.

<b>

<b>

Howard watched her return with a very gentle gaze.

<b>

When Suzy reached Howard, she tilted her head and looked up at him, placing one hand on her hat, asking, "What is it?"

"Suzy... It seems that ten wolf carcasses were found around here."

<b>

As Suzy looked up at Howard, her eyes began to dart around anxiously. Sweat began to pour down her back.

Seeing this, Howard chuckled lightly, covering his mouth with his hand.

<b>

"Suzy? I'm not blaming you, you know?"

"Ah, um... but... but... one... escaped..."

<b>

Suzy clasped her hands and earnestly pleaded with Howard.

<b>

"So... Mr. Cloud... got hurt... I'm... sorry!"

<b>

Suzy clutched Howard's sleeve and pleaded.

Her eyes were beginning to glisten with tears.

<b>

"Suzy, that's not it. Please don't apologize..."

<b>

Howard gently placed his hand on Suzy's shoulder, crouched down to meet her gaze, and began to speak.

<b>

"You were protecting me, weren't you? Thank you. Let me say it again today. Thanks to you, I was able to save my life. Thanks to you, I was able to return to Sonia... Really, thank you!"

"Mr. Cloud... I'm... glad..."

<b>

Suzy smiled happily.

<b>

"Hey. What's going on, August? What is the chief talking about?"

"Well, for now, we need to hurry and clean up the wolf carcasses. That's what it means."

"That's right! We can't leave ten of them lying around! If they start to rot, they'll attract other magical beasts!"

<b>

At the word "attract," Suzy froze with a gasp.

<b>

"Frank. I'm going to return to the Amcam House with Howard now to prepare the carriage and personnel. Until then, you five gather the wolves here."

"Got it! We can't keep going back and forth! Get a large carriage that can hold all the wolves! Hey! Fred! Lead the way! Irvin, let's go!!"

<b>

Frank called out to the two boys who were loading the wolves onto the cart and headed deeper into the forest.

The boy called Irvin waved to Suzy and chased after the two.

Suzy also waved back a little, and Howard smiled gently.

<b>

Hmm, that was the third son of the Haggard family, hmm.

<b>

"I'm going to hurry back to the town hall now. Howard, you have business at the town hall too, right?"

"Yeah, can you handle it?"

<b>

Then, shall we go?

August got into his carriage and left the clearing, heading through the forest.

Howard and Suzy's carriage followed, leaving the clearing as well.
