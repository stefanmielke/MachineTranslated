# 17 Morning with Suzy and the Cloud Family

The dress prepared for today was a light young grass-colored one-piece.

<blank>

Is it a different color than the one from yesterday? No, the skirt is pleated and the bulge is a little bigger.

It also has a ruffle hem.

Why is it that just having frills makes me feel a little better?

<blank>

I finished changing my clothes while thinking about such things.

<blank>

I tied my hair up myself like I had it done yesterday.

<blank>

I was worried about whether I had done it well since it was my first time.

Isn't that funny? I was a little nervous and headed for the living room to greet Sonia and Elrose, who were there for the morning.

<blank>

They greeted me back with gentle smiles.

<blank>

Breakfast is last night's deer tongue stew and omelette with cheese.

I waited for Howard to come to the dining room while I was allowed to help him put the dishes on the table.

Everyone arrives at the table for breakfast together.

<blank>

What is it about a fluffy omelet that makes me so happy?

The adults spent the morning with a warm feeling as they watched Suzy happily eating her meal.

<blank>

I offered to help clean up after breakfast, and Suzy was assigned to do the washing up.

When the dishes were all washed without breaking any, Howard called me over.

<blank>

He said he had to dispose of the magical beasts he had cleaned up yesterday, so he asked me to go with him to inspect them.

I'll be back in time for tea, so if you want, we can have lunch outside together. I say.

<blank>

<blank>

Sonia came over immediately and handed me a large basket and told me it was lunch for two.

Elrose also handed me a thermos-like container, saying, "Please drink this soup with care, as it is warm.

When Susie was told that the basket contained a venison cutlet sandwich and a bacon and vegetable sandwich, she was so excited that her cheeks flushed, her eyes lit up, and she let out a whoop.

<blank>

He looks up with a start, but then notices the warm eyes of the adults looking at him, and his cheeks flush even more.

<blank>

Howard, who took that look as a sign of approval, told Suzy to wait for him as he prepared the carriage and went outside.

<blank>

While waiting for Howard, Sonia brought an apron and hat for Susie.

<blank>

The apron is white and long with thick shoulder straps that cross over the back.

The gathers are tapped, and the waist is covered entirely with a length of ruffles peeking out of the skirt.

The waistband was also wide and long, circling the torso, and when tied in a bow at the back, it looked like a large ribbon around the waist.

<blank>

The hat was a white straw hat with a black ribbon wrapped around the brim and around the head.

The large black ribbon attached to the back of the dress makes it stand out.

<blank>

Sonia and Elrose are pleased with the finished outfits.

<blank>

Suzy looks embarrassed, but she must have liked it well enough because she is mirroring it at various angles while her cheeks are stained.

<blank>

Eventually, Howard came to call Suzy to tell her he was finished getting ready.

Sonia and Elrose both bring Suzy to Howard to show him the fruits of their labor.

Howard's cheeks relax as he sees Suzy's finished product, letting out a breath of admiration.

Suzy turned red and looked down.

<blank>

Shall we go?　Howard escorted Suzy to the carriage.

<blank>

Sonia says, "Have a good day," and deposits the basket in Susie's lap as she gets into the carriage....

I'm off," Suzy waved to Sonia and Elrose.

<blank>

The carriage left the Cloud residence after being seen off by the two men who answered with a wave of their hands.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The carriage continued northward, following the same route it had taken yesterday, so although I was seeing the same scenery I had seen yesterday, it was the opposite of what I had seen yesterday, so I felt a different kind of freshness.

<blank>

I was feeling it, but with my hands on my cheeks, which were still a little red....

<blank>

(I wonder...was I ever the type to show my face or get upset like this? I was proud that I had a thicker face, but...I guess I'm just a teenage gawk! Ah! (She was a teenage girl... damn it... ～～～～...!)

<blank>

And I was groaning in agony on the inside.

<blank>

As if to hide her inner shyness, Suzy was talking to Howard in a haphazard way.

<blank>

How long ago were those tree-lined avenues planted? I think the reason they are so neat and orderly is because the person who planted them and cared for them was very meticulous. If he had planned for this to happen before planting, he must have been someone who could plan in the long run, right? I think a person who makes such long-term plans must have been a very strict person.

<blank>

Why is that Hodgson's pond a pond when it looks like it could be as big as a lake? I'm sure the water is a beautiful light blue or green color, and I'm sure he manages the water quality with a lot of care, so I'm sure he's a man with an eye for all kinds of things. I am sure he is a person who can entertain his family by boating and fishing on that lake on weekends.

<blank>

I spun out my thoughts in poor language about things that really don't matter, such as

<blank>

Howard is not a fan of such words from Susie,

<blank>

That might be an idea. I'll look into it next time. I'm not sure about that, but I'll ask him next time I see him. I see. I had never thought of it that way. Susie has an interesting way of looking at things.

<blank>

He was not offended, but accepted Suzy's words straight away and happily enjoyed the conversation.

<blank>

At first, the conversation started out as a simple conversation with the intention of hiding her embarrassment, but before she knew it, Susie was genuinely enjoying the act of chatting with Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

When we arrived at the entrance to the forest, unlike yesterday, today the carriage proceeded directly into the forest.

<blank>

<blank>

Yesterday, I was trying to make sure that if something happened, they would know I came in here.

<blank>

Howard said, but Suzy's expression became a little more complicated with the word 'if.

<blank>

Thanks to you, I got to meet Suzy.

<blank>

Howard continued with a smile, and Suzy's expression remained complicated, but she looked heartily happy.

<blank>

<blank>

There were about three carriages parked in the square in the woods, in addition to Howard and his things.

<blank>

Two of them were with large carts, already loaded with a single boa corpse.

<blank>

Good morning Mr. Howard. Thank you for coming. We have been expecting you."

Good morning, August. You're here already, working as fast as ever."

We had received word from the temple yesterday, so we were ready to go first thing in the morning."

Come on Susie, let me introduce you. This is Augusto Dulles. He is the chief of this village.

Is... this girl...?"

<blank>

Howard nodded.

<blank>

Suzy is surprised to hear the word "village chief", but immediately...

<blank>

Nice to meet you... Suzy...

<blank>

and introduces himself.

<blank>

<blank>

Augusto looked like a well-dressed gentleman.

<blank>

The protruding belly is probably muscle, not flab.

The hairy arms sticking out from the rolled-up sleeves are covered in muscle and give a sense of strength.

He also has clean, cropped brown hair.

<blank>

Nice to meet you, Susie. I am August Dulles, whom you have just been introduced to. I am the village head of this village.

<blank>

August returned the greeting with a politeness that one would not expect from a young girl of his age.

<blank>

<blank>

Gokouzu!

<blank>

One of the people in the back of the wagon, who had been stacking the bodies of the boas, shouted at us.

<blank>

You were there? Well, as expected of the head of the head! He was able to cut down the two-headed boa with a single stroke! Only the head monk in this village can go this far!"

<blank>

A large, dark-haired, mustachioed man, looking rather pleased with himself, approached Howard and walked up to him.

<blank>

"Really? There are plenty of other people who could cut you off.

<blank>

Howard replies a bit annoyed.

<blank>

No, no, no! I'm sure Bert and the Haggard family could do it with one hand. There are others who can just cut it off..."

<blank>

He came up to Howard and pointed to the wagon with a quick thumbs up.

<blank>

Only the Imperial Head could cut them in two with such a brilliant slice!"

<blank>

Suzy, caught in the act, turns toward the wagon and asks Howard with her eyes if she can take a look.

<blank>

When Howard nodded, he smiled back and trotted up to the wagon.

Suzy is asking something to the boy who was helping her unload.

<blank>

Oh...and that young lady?"

<blank>

I just noticed, the man asked Howard.

<blank>

He's with me, Frank. I'll introduce you later.

<blank>

Howard answers with his eyes on Suzy.

<blank>

"...of your head? ...I see, and that's it!"

<blank>

His face almost clouded over a little, but he changed the subject as if he had regained his composure.

<blank>

Boa was great, but that Gray Wolf! That slash left me speechless! Hey! August!

Oh." That's right Frank! I've never seen such a smooth cut as that!"

Not at all! Even the tips of the fur were cut cleanly! What in the world kind of sword and what kind of slice did you have to make to get such a clean cut!"

<blank>

If you put them together as they are, they will definitely stick together! he continued excitedly and enthusiastically.

<blank>

Well, it was this sword that cut me.

<blank>

and Howard lightly taps the longsword hanging from his waist.

<blank>

Oh! I knew it! What in the world do you usually take care of?　The two of them were excited.

<blank>

But that's the boy who slayed the Wolf with this."

<blank>

He smiles like a mischievous little boy and points at Suzy with his eyes.

<blank>

...nah!

<blank>

They both exclaim.

<blank>

I can see the beautiful flash of the sword in my mind. I can remember the beautiful flash of the sword from my body with no effort. That is something I will never forget.

It is! Is it true! Your head!

Howard: "So it's true...it's true? Howard! She's really true?

<blank>

<blank>

Team Leader! Squad Leader Long!

<blank>

As they were coloring, one young man came into the square from deep in the woods.

<blank>

You want a "what? Oh. What's up, Fred?"

I just looked around like you said...and there were other Wolf carcasses."

What the hell?"

<blank>

The men raised their voices.

<blank>

"No, there are still others...!"

"There were ten of them in all. It was impossible for the three of us to carry them all at once, so I went back to report them to you.

".........?

<blank>

Three men speechless.

<blank>

"...well, I've been..."

"Howard... sir?"

Fred! What happened to the other two?"

Randolph and Ruffino are still searching around to see if they can find anything else.

"Susie! Can you come over here for a minute?"

<blank>

Howard called Suzy over.

Suzy thanked the boy who had been talking to her at the wagon, and toot-toot, she ran back to Howard's place.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard watched him very, very calmly.

<blank>

When Susie walked back to Howard, she asked, "What's wrong? He put one hand on his hat and looked up at Howard with a small tilt of his head.

<blank>

"Susie...they just found 10 Wolf carcasses around here."

<blank>

Susie's eyes start to swim busily as she looks up at Howard. Sweat is pouring down her back.

Seeing this, Howard cussed and put his lightly clasped hand over his mouth and blew it out.

<blank>

"Susie? I'm not accusing you of anything.

"Oh, um... but... but... I... got... out... of... one... thing... so..."

<blank>

Susie clasps her hands and single-mindedly appeals to Howard.

<blank>

So... Mr. Cloud... you... got... hurt... I'm sorry!

<blank>

Suzy grips Howard's sleeve and appeals.

My eyes were getting a little teary.

<blank>

'Suzy, it's not like that. Don't be sorry..."

<blank>

Howard gently puts his hand on Susie's shoulder, sits back, looks at her at the same eye level, and begins to talk.

<blank>

"You were protecting me, weren't you? Thank you. I'll say it again today. You saved my life. You got me home to Sonia. ...... Thank you so, so much!"

"K... Mr. Cloud... yes... thank God..."

<blank>

Suzy smiled happily.

<blank>

Hey. What do you mean, August? What's your head saying?"

Well, I had to clean up Gray Wolf's carcass in a hurry for the time being. That's what I'm saying.

We can't leave ten of them out there forever! If they start to smell rotten, they'll attract other magical beasts!"

<blank>

Suzy froze at the words "I'll call her! and froze.

<blank>

<blank>

Frank. I'm going to go back to the Amcom House with Mr. Howard and get the wagon and men ready. In the meantime, the five of you will gather Wolf here."

Oh! I'm not going to go back and forth! We can't keep going back and forth! Ask for a bigger carriage that Wolf can load up! Hey, Fred! Fred! Lead the way! Irving, let's go!

<blank>

Frank called out to the two boys who were loading Wolf into the wagon, and they went deeper into the woods.

A boy called Irving waved to Suzy and followed them.

Suzy responded with a small wave of her hand. Howard smiled serenely.

<blank>

Hmm, that was the third son of the Haggard family, hmm.

<blank>

I'm going back to the town hall as soon as I can. I'm sure Mr. Howard has some business to attend to at the town hall.

Yeah, can you ask?"

<blank>

Well, let's get going.

and August gets into his carriage, leaves the square, and goes through the forest.

Howard and Susie's carriage followed them out of the square.
