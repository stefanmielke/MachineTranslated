# Episode 24: Suzy Cloud and the Village Children

On that day, the upperclassmen who hadn't come yesterday arrived at school a little late.

<b>

Karla Edgar was relatively small, about the height between Dana and me.

Her short bob of black hair and black eyes gave her a Japanese-like appearance, which made me feel a sense of familiarity.

<b>

Alicia and Jessica were tall, about the same height as Mia or maybe a bit taller? Is it just age-appropriate?

<b>

Alicia Lugosi had slightly wavy, soft-looking ash-brown hair tied in a ponytail with a white ribbon.

<b>

Jessica Karlov had strawberry blonde hair braided and hanging over both shoulders, and her long limbs gave her a model-like figure.

<b>

<b>

In the end, I was also twisted around by these three.

<b>

It seems I have secured the position of a pet here.

<b>

Again today, as I was spinning around like a small boat tossed by the waves, one of the upperclassmen, a boy named Victor Frank, silently approached me.

He placed his hand on my shoulder and whispered something to me...

Immediately, Alicia punched Victor squarely in the face!

<b>

Victor, with his beautiful blonde hair flowing, flew backward.

<b>

As I was surprised by the sudden turn of events, wondering what was happening, I noticed that Victor had somehow gotten close to Mia, wrapping his hand around her waist!

In the next moment, Karla's splendid punch struck Victor, sending him flying far away like Galactica Magnum!!

<b>

"Listen, Su! You mustn't make eye contact with him, okay? Don't get close! If he comes near you, make sure to shout loudly! Got it?!"

<b>

Karla firmly held my shoulders and warned me with a serious look.

All the girls nodded vigorously and then let out a big sigh.

<b>

Ah, I see, he is that kind of guy...

I forced a smile at Karla while nodding slightly, saying, "I-I understand."

<b>

<b>

Mary, a year below me, apologized, saying, "I'm sorry for my brother."

Shelly, the one below her, added, "I'm really sorry for the trouble."

<b>

Mary, who is in the 6th grade, and Shelly, who is in the 4th grade, are both said to be Victor's sisters.

<b>

"You two aren't at fault; there's no need to apologize," Karla and Alicia comforted them.

<b>

With things being like this, I can't help but worry about what will happen when we go to town... I'm really anxious about it...

"Don't worry! We'll make sure to keep him on a leash!" Jessica said, thumping her chest...

<b>

"Hahaha! It's okay, sisters! We love each other this much. What is there to worry about?"

<b>

Victor, hugging Jessica from behind, smiled and whispered in her ear! When did he get there!? His white teeth just sparkled!

<b>

"It's about you! A-na-ta no ko-to!!"

<b>

Saying this, Jessica delivered an iron claw to Victor's face.

I heard a crunching sound.

<b>

Victor kept tapping Jessica's arm, but the clawing hand was being lifted higher and higher, and finally, with a loud squish, something crushed, and Victor's body went limp.

<b>

Jessica tossed him out the window and then turned back to Mary and Shelly, smiling, "It's okay, really."

<b>

W-What is this!? What just happened?! What happened to him? Is he alive!?

As I was in shock, Colin came over to me...

<b>

"Don't worry. It's just the usual."

"What!? The usual...?"

"Yes. There's no need to worry about him! Just think of him as 'that kind of thing,' okay?"

<b>

Colin said gently while adjusting her glasses.

<b>

"More importantly... you don't want Stefan to turn into something like that, right? You need to teach him what he shouldn't do!"

<b>

That's right; I want that innocent, mischievous boy to grow up straight.

I don't want him to become something strange!

<b>

I nodded vigorously at Colin.

<b>

Another upperclassman, Arrows Bias, came over to apologize for the commotion.

<b>

Ah, good, he's a normal person. And a gentleman! That makes me feel relieved. Normal is good, right? Normal is the best!

<b>

<b>

By the way, the other boys...

I noticed them this morning, you know?

<b>

The one year older, Willy Hodgson.

The same age, Lombard Bloke, and of course, Irvin too.

The one year younger, the Long family’s Bernap and Karla's brother Alan.

And the Smith family's twins, Clark and Ashton.

<b>

Did you notice Stefan getting closer to me and then all of you sneaking around behind me?

Moreover, you all gasped when you saw my backside, right?

<b>

I noticed, you know?

<b>

...That said, they're all still kids, so it's not a big deal if they see my underwear... I understand their feelings too.

If I knew my skirt was going to fly up, I would definitely go for it.

Yeah, I would definitely go for it! It's only natural for boys, right? That's just how boys are!!

<b>

However! 

The girl-like feelings growing inside me are also saying, "I must not forget this incident!"

<b>

I really can't let Stefan do such things.

<b>

But honestly, I was pale with fright just now.

For a moment, I thought my head was going to explode... it didn't, though...

Still, what if my insides had turned to mush!? I was seriously about to cry.

<b>

I definitely had a concussion.

I instinctively placed my hand on my forehead and sent "ki" to myself, which is what you call "first aid."

I think the reason I didn't need to use healing was that this "first aid" was very effective.

<b>

Now that I think about it, the time I healed Mr. Howard's wound was also thanks to this "first aid."

<b>

It was used in conjunction with the detoxification magic "Cure," but now I can heal small wounds with just "first aid."

<b>

In any case, I'm really glad that Stefan woke up safely.

<b>

Next time, I’ll try to use "ki" to "hold back" a bit.

I’ll wrap it around like a cushion.

After all, that kind of kid won't give up and will keep targeting me, so I feel a little bad for him, but I’ll let him be my practice target.

<b>

In return, as long as he keeps targeting me, I’ll train him.

<b>

I’ll change the pace of my openings and my stance little by little...

Hehehe, anytime you want, Stefan! I’ll make sure to train you properly!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

That day, lunch became very lively.

<b>

In addition to the six from yesterday, three upperclassmen, and Jessica's sister Janice from the 3rd grade.

Including me, a total of 11 people gathered, more than half of the girls in the school.

<b>

Well, that doesn't matter because Sonia Mama's bento is delicious, and that's justice!

Today's lunch is a baguette sandwich with thick-cut bacon and fluffy eggs.

<b>

The salty baguette and the savory bacon, along with the gentle sweetness of the eggs, perfectly enhance each other!

Ahh! Sonia Mama! How do you know my preferences so accurately!?

<b>

As I happily chewed on the baguette...

<b>

"Su-chan looks so happy! Is it good?"

<b>

Mia asked with a big smile.

<b>

"Mm! ...It's delicious! ...Delicious is... happiness...!"

"Would you like to try this?"

<b>

She offered me some sausage.

This is a special lamb sausage from the Mathison family, made by her grandmother.

The combination of herbs, salt, and spices added to the meat is a secret recipe.

<b>

"Here, open wide!" Mia said, offering the sausage, and I took a bite.

<b>

As I bit into the lamb casing, the rich flavor of the meat and the aroma of the herbs burst forth!

Ahh! Oh! The deliciousness is making my jaw joints! The area just in front of my ears is going all tingly!!

Th-this is it! This is what makes your cheeks fall off!!

<b>

I couldn't help but cover my cheeks with both hands and squish them! Seeing that, Mia looked delighted...

<b>

"Su-chan, is it delicious?"

<b>

She asked the obvious question.

What are you saying! Of course, it is!! So I properly answered her.

<b>

"It's so delicious...!"

<b>

Mia's face melted with joy upon hearing that.

Meanwhile, Karla, who was watching in surprise, said,

<b>

"Su, Su! I'll give you some of mine too! Try it! Here! Open wide!"

<b>

She offered me a thick slice of bologna sausage.

<b>

Gratefully, I took a bite, and it was also incredibly delicious and made me squish my cheeks again.

<b>

That started a chain reaction, and everyone began to offer me food.

Well, everything was delicious, and I was very happy, but...

Wait a minute! Isn't this like when children feed small animals!?

So I really was in the position of a pet!?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the afternoon study group, Jessica came.

<b>

Karla and Alicia said they would be instructing the lowerclassmen in the training area.

When I said I wanted to contract with the next attribute today, Colin told me that was impossible.

<b>

Apparently, contracting with someone who has multiple affinities consumes their ether body, so I have to wait for it to recover before I can make the next contract.

<b>

Normally, it takes weeks to months, and for some, it can take up to six months to recover.

<b>

"Oh! But you're not normal... Want to give it a try?"

<b>

Bibi said.

What a thing to say! How rude!

<b>

When I was asked what attribute I wanted, I requested "fire."

Then, this time, they brought a case with red light floating in it.

I quickly set it on the five-element plate again.

<b>

They said it would react if my ether body had recovered, so they told me to place my hand on it, and when I did... it glowed faintly, just like yesterday.

<b>

It really reacted! Bibi said in amazement.

Everyone else was wide-eyed and frozen.

Could you please stop that? It’s becoming unbearable when it reacts like that repeatedly!

<b>

I thought I could contract with it, but since Henry and the priest weren't here today, it was impossible, Bibi said.

<b>

"I'm a priest-in-training, so I can do it!" Jessica raised her hand.

<b>

Jessica is a user of healing magic and is studying to become a priest, so she can perform initial contracts.

<b>

<b>

Since it was a good opportunity, I asked for the fire attribute contract.

When I told Jessica that I could make three more contracts, she was surprised and wide-eyed, but then she casually suggested, "Well, if that's the case, how about we do a different one every day?"

<b>

Having finished the fire spirit contract, I said, "Alright, let's try it!" and tried to head outside just like yesterday when Colin, Mia, and Bibi stopped me.

<b>

Did you forget about the outrageous water orb I produced last time?

If I produce a fire pillar like that, who knows what will happen!

We can't let children do such things!!

Next time, when the priest comes, try it under supervision!

You should reflect on what you've done!

<b>

And for some reason, I was lectured.

Hmm? I don't think I did anything wrong... I don't understand!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After today's lesson ended, I was chatting by the well like yesterday when... just like yesterday, I sensed someone approaching me.

<b>

This kid is amazing; none of the other kids noticed.

Well, I can tell right away!

<b>

Then, as he slipped into the best position for him, he placed his hand on my skirt, and at that moment.

I gently placed the pad of my index finger on his forehead while simultaneously wrapping it in "ki."

<b>

Imagining wrapping my soft index finger in cotton...

Alright! This should work!

<b>

I lightly tapped his forehead with the pad of my finger.

A sound like something being struck echoed, and Stefan's head jerked back as he fell into the bushes behind him.

<b>

"What!? What was that sound!?"

"Hey? Is that Stefan's foot sticking out from the bushes?"

"What?! Again, that brat!"

"Oh, but this time it was an attempted assault."

"Mm! ...I did it well...!!"

<b>

As I proudly placed my hands on my hips, everyone praised me, saying, "See, you can do it!" "As expected of you, Su," and I was somehow being hugged.

Ahh!!

<b>

<b>

"So? Why are you all gathered there?"

<b>

Alicia asked the boys who were gathered behind me.

<b>

"They were... there this morning... when I was flipped over?"

<b>

"“““““““...Huh?””””””””

"There were everyone except Karl and... the boys... this morning."

<b>

This morning, only Karl Jacobi sighed and shook his head when the other boys gathered and didn't come over.

In my mind, this kid scored high points.

<b>

"You guys... could it be...?"

"Huh? No way! Willy too?!"

"Hmph! So Irvin is like that too!"

"Alan! You can't be serious!!"

"Whoa!!"

<b>

The boys scattered like a flock of birds.

<b>

"Wait! You guys!!"

<b>

Dana and Karla chased after the fleeing boys.

<b>

In the midst of that, Willy was caught by Mia and Colin, and their lecture began.

Willy looks like an intellectual glasses boy, but he’s strangely incompetent.

But, it’s been revealed that he’s a bit of a pervert, right?

<b>

Stefan poked his head out from the bushes, looking around, "What? What?"

<b>

What a peaceful scene.

I couldn't help but smile and laugh.

Yes! I love this village!!

Next time, the story will slightly diverge from Amukam.
