# 24 Suzie Cloud and the Village Children

On that day, the most senior students who had not arrived yesterday came to school a little later.

<blank>

Carla Edgarra was a relatively petite girl, about halfway between my height and Dana's height.

Her short bob, black hair and dark eyes made her look Japanese, which made me feel close to her.

<blank>

Alicia and Jessica are taller, about the same height as Mia or maybe a little taller? I guess that means they are appropriate for their age?

<blank>

Alicia Lugosi had soft ash brown hair with a slight habit, which she wore in a ponytail with a white ribbon.

<blank>

Jessica Karloff's strawberry blonde hair hangs from both shoulders in a braid, and her slender limbs give her a style reminiscent of a model.

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, these three were also trumped.

<blank>

Apparently, I have secured a position as a lapdog here.

<blank>

Today, again, I was like a small boat being tossed about by the waves, and as I was getting my eyeballs around, one of the most senior students, a boy named Victor Frank, came up beside me without a sound.

Then he put his hand on my shoulder and whispered something to me. ......

Immediately, Alicia reduced Victor to a goop punch to the middle of his face!

<blank>

Victor flutters his beautiful blonde hair and flies to the back of the room.

<blank>

What's with the sudden turn of events? What? What?　When I was surprised, Victor was standing beside Mia with his hands around her waist before I knew it!

The next moment, a brilliant punch from Carla, who had her eyes downcast, exploded into Victor, and he went flying far away, just like Gala0tica0gnum!

<blank>

"Okay, Sue. Don't make eye contact with that thing, okay? Don't even come close to it! If he comes near you, make a loud noise! Okay?

<blank>

I was warned by Kara with a serious look in her eyes, holding me firmly by both shoulders.

The girls all nodded vigorously and then let out a loud sigh.

<blank>

Oh, no wonder, he's that kind of guy. ......

I gave a small nod, a smile twitching at Kara, and said, "Wow, okay.

<blank>

<blank>

Mary, one year younger than me, apologized to me for my brother.

Sorry for the trouble I always cause, is Shelley below.

<blank>

Mary, a 6th dan, and Shelley, a 4th dan, are both Victor's sisters.

<blank>

Kara and Alicia comforted them, "It's not your fault, it's nothing to be sorry about.

<blank>

I'm worried about what will happen when we go to the city at this rate... I'm worried about it now. ......　The two of them are expressing their concerns.

Don't worry! We'll make sure the noose is tied around your neck, don't worry!　and Jessica was tapping her chest. ......

<blank>

It's okay, sisters! We love each other so much. What the hell do you have to worry about?"

<blank>

Victor says as he holds her from behind Jessica and smiles and whispers around her neck!

When did this happen? Did you just see those white teeth flashing around your mouth?

<blank>

It's you! It's about you!

<blank>

Jessica then bites an iron claw in Victor's face.

I heard a crackling sound.

<blank>

Victor was tapping Jessica's arm constantly, but the claw-bitten hand was lifted higher and higher, and finally, one loud mecak! and then Victor's body hung limply and powerlessly.

<blank>

Jessica tossed it out the window and smiled again at Mary and Shelley, saying, "It's going to be okay.

<blank>

What the hell is this? What happened? What happened to him? Is he alive?

As I was feeling upset by the unexpected event, Colin came to my side....

<blank>

I'll be fine. It happens all the time, so don't worry about it, okay?"

I'm sorry! Is this... usual... thing...?"

Yes," he said. He doesn't have to worry! He's just that kind of 'thing' you have to deal with.

<blank>

Colin gently said to me as he lifted his glasses with a quick flick.

<blank>

You don't want Stefan to become that thing, do you? You don't want Stefan to become that thing, do you? You don't want Stefan to become that thing, do you?

<blank>

Yes, I want that pure-hearted naughty boy to grow up straight.

I don't want it to be this weird thing!

<blank>

I nodded to Colin many times.

<blank>

Another boy, Arrows Beas, the most senior student, came over to apologize for making so much noise.

<blank>

Oh, thank God, he's a normal person. And a gentleman! What a relief. Normal is good, right? Normal is the best!

<blank>

<blank>

In case you're wondering - the other boys....

I noticed it this morning, didn't I?

<blank>

Willie Hodgson, one above.

Lombard Blouk, who is the same age, and of course Irving.

Belknap, one of the younger Longs, and Carla's brother Alan.

Below them are the twins Clark and Ashton of the Smith family.

<blank>

You noticed Stefan approaching me and zipping around behind me, didn't you?

Oh, my God, look at my ass!　You were cheering, weren't you?

<blank>

I'm aware of that, right?

<blank>

I know that ...... is just a child, and I don't really care if they see my underwear...but I understand how you feel.

If I knew that my skirt would be rolled up, I would definitely go.

Unh, I'm definitely going! It's only natural for a boy! That's what a man's saga is all about!

<blank>

However! It is.

Something inside of me that is growing into a daughterly spirit is thinking, "I will not forget this! It is also true that I am thinking, "I will never forget this!

<blank>

I knew I shouldn't have let Stefan do this.

<blank>

But really, I was bloodthirsty just now.

For a moment I thought I had a pomegranate on my head...and it wasn't cracked....

Still, what if the contents were the tofu I dropped! I was seriously about to cry.

<blank>

I definitely had a concussion.

I immediately put my hand on his forehead and sent "Ki" to him, so to speak.

I think the reason I didn't have to use heels was because this 'treatment' was so effective.

<blank>

Looking back, it occurs to me that it was this "treatment" that healed Mr. Howard's wounds at that time.

<blank>

It was in combination with the detoxification magic "Cure," but now I can heal even small wounds with "treatment.

<blank>

Either way, I'm really glad Stefan woke up safe and sound.

<blank>

Next time, let's try the method of "holding back" by putting on "Ki".

Yes, we wear "Ki" with the intention of using it as a buffer.

That kind of girl will not give up and will come after you persistently anyway, so I'm sorry for that girl, but I'm going to ask her to be my training ground for a bit.

<blank>

I'm not saying that I'm not willing to do that! I'll train you as long as you come after me.

<blank>

I'm going to do it a little bit at a time, by slowing down the gaps and changing my standing position....

Come anytime, Stefan! I'll make sure you're ready!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Lunch that day became very lively.

<blank>

The six of us from yesterday, plus three of the most senior students, plus Jessica's sister, Janice, who is in the third level.

Including myself, a total of 11 people, more than half of the girls in the school, had gathered.

<blank>

Well, regardless of that, Sonia Mama's lunches are delicious, and that's justice!

Today's lunch is a baguette sandwich with thick-cut bacon and fluffy egg.

<blank>

The salty baguette, the bacon, and the gentle sweetness of the eggs complement each other perfectly!

Ahh..! Sonia-mama! Why do you have to be so precise about what I like!

<blank>

I was chewing a baguette happily.

<blank>

Sue, you look so happy. Is it good?

<blank>

Mia asked smiling.

<blank>

Hmmm..! ... delicious! Delicious... is... happy...!

You can try this one if you want."

<blank>

and shared the intestinal meat with us.

This is the Matisun family's special lamb sausage, which apparently was made by my grandmother.

It seems that the combination of herbs, salt, and spices added to the meat is a secret recipe.

<blank>

Mia offers me a bite of the intestine, "Hi, ahhhhh.

<blank>

When you bite through the lamb's intestines in your mouth, the flavor of the meat and aroma of herbs overflows!

Aafunyun! Ahh! Aaah! The base of my jaw is stimulated by the flavor! The area a little in front of my ear is squeaking~~~!

This is it! It's a hoppe-falling thing~~!

<blank>

Unintentionally, she holds her cheeks with both hands and flutters! Mia watching it happily....

<blank>

Sue, is it good?"

<blank>

And they ask the obvious.

What are you talking about? It's not natural! So I answered him properly.

<blank>

"Oh, my... oh, my!"

<blank>

Mia's face was happily prodigal when she heard it.

Even more so was Carla, who looked at it with a surprised look on her face.

<blank>

I'll give you this one, too! I'll raise this one of mine too! Try it? Hola! Ahhhhh!"

<blank>

He offered me a thickly sliced bologna sausage.

<blank>

I thankfully took a bite of it, which was also very tasty and frizzy.

<blank>

Starting with that, everyone came to me for food.

Well, they were all delicious and I was very happy. ......

But wait a minute! Isn't that what this is? The kind of thing where kids feed small animals!

I guess I was a lapdog after all!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Jessica came to the afternoon workshop.

<blank>

Carla and Alicia will be mentoring the underclassmen in the training hall.

I said I wanted to sign another contract today, but Colin told me it was not possible.

<blank>

The contract for a person with multiple affinities for anything is that the etheric body is depleted and the next contract cannot be made until it recovers from that depletion.

<blank>

Usually it takes a few weeks to a few months, or even six months for some people.

<blank>

I'm not normal! But you're not normal, so why don't you try ......?"

<blank>

Bibi told me.

What a girl to say! I'm going to be rude!

<blank>

He asked me what attribute I wanted and I asked for 'fire'.

Then this time he brought a case with a floating red light.

Immediately set it on the Gosei board again.

<blank>

I was told that if the etheric body is recovering, it will respond, so I put my hand on it and tried it... and it glowed faintly, just as it did yesterday.

<blank>

I really reacted!　Bibi said in disgust.

Everyone else is wide-eyed and frozen.

Will you stop doing that? I get so tired of that reaction so often, don't you?

<blank>

I was wondering if I could sign a contract with this, but I can't because neither Henry nor the priest are here today! Bibi said.

<blank>

I'm an apprentice priest, so I can do it.　Jessica raised her hand.

<blank>

Jessica is a user of restorative magic and has studied to be a priestess, so she can do the initial contract.

<blank>

<blank>

I asked for a fire attribute contract because of the opportunity.

I told Jessica that she could sign three more contracts, to which she rolled her eyes and said, "Well, I have time, so why don't we do a contract every day? I was surprised when she rolled her eyes and said, "Well, I've got time, so why don't we do a contract every day?

<blank>

The contract with the fire spirit was over, and I was about to go outside as I did yesterday, when Colin, Mia, and Bibi stopped me with all my might.

<blank>

Did you forget that you put out such substandard polka dots when you were in the water?

I don't know what would happen if they put out a pillar of fire like that!

I can't let you do that when all I have is my kids!

Next time the priest comes again, try it under supervision!

Look back at what you did a little!

<blank>

And for some reason, he gave me a sermon.

Hmmm? I don't think I did anything wrong...I don't understand!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After today's lesson was over, I was again at the well as I had been yesterday...I still felt a presence approaching me, just as I had done yesterday.

<blank>

I knew she was great, none of the kids around her noticed.

Well, I know exactly what you mean!

<blank>

And the moment he slid into the best position for him and put his hand on my skirt.

I put my index finger on his forehead, and at the same time, I put "Ki" on his forehead.

<blank>

It's like softly wrapping your index finger in cotton. ......

Okay, I've got it! We can go for this!

<blank>

I lightly placed my finger on his forehead with a flick of my finger.

Stefan makes a sound as if he is hitting something, and then turns his head and plunges headfirst into a plantation behind him.

<blank>

What? That sound!"

What's that?" Is that Stephan's foot sticking out of the plantings?"

What did you say? Again, you little brat!"

"Ah, but this time it's an attempt."

"Hmmm! I... did... it... well...!"

<blank>

I proudly put my hands on my hips and said, "You can do it if you try!　Everyone praised me, and for some reason I was squirming around.

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

<blank>

<blank>

"So? Why are you guys meeting there?"

<blank>

Alicia asked the boys gathered behind me.

<blank>

I was there... this morning... when... you... turned... me... over?"

<blank>

「「「「「「「...... What? 」」」」」」」

<blank>

Except for Carl and... the... children... of... his... age... they... were... all... there.

<blank>

This morning, Carl Jacobini was the only one who didn't come up behind the other boys when they gathered, sighing and shaking his head.

She has a high point in my mind.

<blank>

"Are you guys...?"

What? No way! Willie too?"

I'm not sure I'll ever get to see him again! I knew Irving was the one!"

Alan! You can't be!

Ew!

<blank>

The boys run away like spiders.

<blank>

Wait! You guys!

<blank>

and Dana, Kara and the others chase after the fleeing boys.

<blank>

In the midst of all this, Willie was the only one who grabbed onto Mia and Colin, and their sermonizing began.

Willie looks like an intelligent guy with glasses, but he's strangely to the point.

But they knew I was a muthafucka, didn't they?

<blank>

Stefan just poked his head out of the bushes. What? What?　He's scurrying around.

<blank>

What a peaceful scene.

I can't help but laugh with amusement.

Oooh! I love this village!

In the next issue, the story will move away from Amcam a bit.
