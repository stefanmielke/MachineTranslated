# 39 - Suzy Cloud coming forward.

The depressing development is over.


----------------

<blank>

'Ha, ha, ha, it's hard to say you won't let them die, isn't it? Hey? What are you going to do? All these kids are about to die, you know? Right? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."

<blank>

Doug laughs and waves his right hand as if signaling something.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy stepped forward with a swoosh.

<blank>

Bibi, Irving, just give me a second. I'll be quick, okay?"

<blank>

As Suzy said these words, she helped Irving to his feet and walked past Beatrice, who was supporting him.

Algernon kicks in, and Beatrice flanks him.

<blank>

"Sue...?"

<blank>

Beatrice stared wide-eyed at Suzy's back.

<blank>

"...... what's up...Bibi?"

<blank>

Irving asked Beatrice, who had stopped moving, as she endured the intense pain in her arm.

<blank>

"...... that girl... she's out of it."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The shadow dogs that had attached themselves to the front three were all running toward Suzy, except for one.

<blank>

The last one of them raised its fangs without hesitation at Helena's neck, who was lying motionless on the ground, as if following some instruction.

<blank>

Aggi! Gghhh!"

Oh! This guy! Wait..! Oh, shit!

<blank>

Helena lets out a grunt of sudden intense pain.

Dana tried to go after the shadow dog that had fangs for Helena, but the wound on her shin prevented her from getting to her feet and she fell to her knees on the spot.

The shadow dog, with Helena's neck in its mouth, starts running with the last of the preceding shadow dogs.

At that moment, Suzy watched with narrowed eyes as Kageinu's mouth hung open in disgust.

<blank>

"What is that? You're holding me hostage?"

<blank>

Suzy tilted her head and cast a cold look at Shadow Dog.

He lifted his chin and moved his foot forward. Then, the body swayed.

<blank>

Suzy's skirt flutters.

<blank>

The next moment, a sword grew next to the mouth of the shadow dog that was holding Helena in its mouth.

<blank>

A white silver sword blade extended from the left side of the shadow dog's face.

On the opposite side of his face is Suzy's left hand, gripping the hilt of his sword.

Suzy opened her arms with a swish, and as if she was slicing a piece of candy, the upper jaw and head of the shadow dog were neatly separated from the rest of the body.

The body of the remaining shadow dog, which had lost half of its head, fell down yukkuri as it was.

Susie held Helena's body with her right hand to keep it from falling and pulled it away from the shadow dog's body.

<blank>

"Suzy ......, my sister ......?"

Helena... you did great.

"Su, Suzy, oh, my sister ......, me, me!"

Don't worry, I'm healing now.

<blank>

The five shadow dogs that had been heading toward Suzy suddenly lost sight of her and were sniffing around on the ground as if searching for her scent.

However, he soon found a target behind him and was once again running toward Suzy.

<blank>

<blank>

≪'Chain Regeneration'.

Skill of "Great Wiseman", a recovery job.

It connects all allies with a line of vitality centered on itself, regenerates HP at once, and continues to recover vitality for a short period of time.

<blank>

With Suzy at the center, a golden, glowing line runs through the earth, extending to all the children present.

<blank>

"Oh, sister ......? This?

<blank>

Helena's core was filled with warmth, and as she watched, her wounds healed and her strength was restored.

Helena checked herself and was astonished.

<blank>

<blank>

All the other children recover and get back on their feet.

Dana, Lombardo, Carl, Irving, Colin, Mia, and Mary.

Alan, Belknap, and Stefan, as well as all the children from the former parade ground, one after the other.

Only Fiorina and William, deprived of blood, have yet to make a move.

<blank>

<blank>

What's this? What's this? Can you move your arm?

Oh, Irving? ...... awesome."

<blank>

Beatrice was surprised to see that Irving's arm, which had been exposed to the bone after having been repeatedly poked by the shadow dog's fangs, had healed beautifully.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, that?" Doesn't that hurt? ...... that?"

Mia?" I can't believe it. ....... Thank God...thank God, Mia.... Ah! E...er...and Mia, Mia? Here, this ...... is this... I think I'd better put this ...... on..."

<blank>

Mia's black spear had gouged her side cleanly back, exposing her skin from the sides of her ripped clothing, and her ample breasts were nearly spilling out through the ripped garment.

Willie removed the cape he was wearing and placed it over Mia's shoulders, a blush on his cheeks to hide the fact that he was wearing a cape.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh! My legs! I can move so much! I can move so much!"

Mwah! Looks like the power's coming back!"

<blank>

Dana jumped on the spot and turned his spear and slammed it into the shadow dog's nose.

Strength returns to Lombardo's hand holding the tower shield.

<blank>

<blank>

Can you stand? I can walk! That's great Sue ...... everyone! Everyone's okay!"

<blank>

At Colin's call, the twins Clark and Ashton, who were being treated at the site of the training center, Charles, Thomas, Leila, and Virgil came to voice their safety.

<blank>

Outside the training hall, too, Carl stood up, checking where the wounds on his body had been, and Mary wiped the blood from her forehead, which had stopped bleeding, and was surprised to see that the wounds had disappeared.

<blank>

Furthermore, even on the other side of the stone wall...

<blank>

What happened? ...Huh? Huh? Fiorina? ...Whoa! Will is here too! Hey! Belknap! Can you move?

No problem! No problem. Is Alan the one who can move?"

No problem at all! Hey! Stefan! You can't move either, can you?

I'm totally fine!

I'm going to go! I don't know what's going on, but it looks like the enemy is standing around! I don't know what's going on, but it looks like the enemy is standing around! You take Fiorina! We're getting the hell out of here!

<blank>

Belknap and Stefan nodded and dragged them out of the place with them, still not opening their eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

This is just a side note.

<blank>

Suzy then pulled out the two swords hanging from her waist and raised her hands above her head.

Holding the sword as if it were hanging above his head, he moves his body with his eyes downcast, swaying his body in a steady rhythm.

And what leaks from his mouth....

<blank>

'Song? ...... Suzy...sister ......? .........!!!!"

<blank>

As Helena's eyes widened in surprise at the sight of Suzy, the returning shadow dogs jumped on her.

When Helena noticed it, its fangs were already on the verge of reaching Suzy.

Fangs bite into Suzy's body!

The moment it looked like that, Kageinu's fangs cut the sky emptily, and his body also passed by without touching Suzy.

All five shadow dogs land without being touched by Suzy.

<blank>

Neither the shadow dogs nor Helena, who was watching in front of them, understood what had happened.

Yet again the shadow dogs pounce.

However, Suzy still can't even snatch it.

<blank>

Susie does not seem to be bothered by such a situation, and she sings a song and dances around the room.

Soon, the children began to hear sounds different from singing.

<blank>

What is that? Is that a guitar?"

The drums are beating."

"Organ sounds?"

This is Lute, right?"

I can hear the harp, too."

<blank>

The ...... orchestra of the genie?"

<blank>

Helena couldn't help but speak up and look at Suzy again.

<blank>

Her fiery red hair danced in the light of the setting sun on the horizon, shimmering in the light of the falling sun.

A silvery white sword cuts through the golden light.

In the light, Suzy swayed and danced gently and elongated.

The sunset light on his face was so gentle and serene that Helena, seeing him up close, even thought he was a god.

Helena's heart fills with a hot substance.

<blank>

At the same time, he could feel his own body overflowing with power.

Helena's senses were sharpened as never before.

At that moment, I saw Kageinu kick the ground, ready to strike for the second time.

Helena held two daggers in her opposite hands and instantly slid her body in a straight line between the shadow dog and Suzy.

<blank>

"You dare to interfere with my sister...! You insolent thing!

<blank>

Helena slammed the shadow dog that opened its mouth with the dagger she held to the right in an attempt to break its fangs.

<blank>

Helena's dagger went straight for the shadow dog's lower fangs, cutting off the lower jaw as well.

Helena bent low and got into the pocket of the next shadow dog that jumped in, where she stretched out and swung her left dagger inward.

The dagger sliced through the shadow dog's abdomen, spilling its guts.

<blank>

What? Huh? Huh?

<blank>

Helena could not hide her surprise at the spur-of-the-moment move she took and the power of the attack.

Then another sharp flash of sword flashed.

Irving's longsword.

<blank>

Irving picked up his longsword as soon as he was sure his own wounds had healed, and he leaped toward the shadow dogs swarming around Suzy.

The slash from below easily sliced through Kageinu's body, killing him.

The longsword that went up to the upper level is swung down as it is and slammed into the face of the second head.

The shadow dog's cranium was ripped in two and slaughtered as it was.

<blank>

What the heck is this? Why is this so easy?"

<blank>

Irving, too, is astonished at the power he wields.

Suddenly, a thud echoes from behind!　sounded from behind me.

With that, there was a big hole in the face of the last one.

Karl fired a "Fire Bullet" from behind.

<blank>

Hey! What? This power?

<blank>

Carl voiced his surprise as well.

<blank>

<blank>

Mary easily avoided the Brutal Bat that glided by and shot an arrow at it from behind.

The arrow, which had barely pierced the skin earlier, pierced deeply with piercing force.

The arrowhead went straight for the vital spot and shot the brute bat down.

Mary was amazed at the accuracy of her own hit and the power of her bow.

<blank>

<blank>

Kelum eigo spero eude." Mia Mathisun, daughter of Mathisun, who is connected to Amukam, seeks and appeals to Nyumpeh, the keeper of the waters. Let the power of the stream of water destroy our enemies! ≪Water Cutter."

<blank>

Mia chanted a congratulatory prayer and thrust the index fingers of both hands toward the Brutal Bat in the sky above.

A very fine stream of water flows from the tips of both fingers in a straight line up into the sky.

Mia moved her left and right fingertips in an up-and-down motion, and the Brutal Bat, which was on the line of the water flow, was cut off vertically and fell to the ground like a dead leaf.

<blank>

Wow, what is this? What is this? This far away? Something that big? Wow!"

<blank>

Mia rolled her eyes, and Willie, watching next to her, was speechless.

<blank>

<blank>

Dana spins her spear and scoops it up from under the shadow dog.

Dana thrust a series of spears at the shadow dog, which had lost its footing in mid-air.

He pulls out the spear that hit the vital stopping point and dances it directly to the next shadow dog.

<blank>

Lombardo held the tower shield he had been handling with both hands with one left hand and re-gripped the battle-axe he carried at his waist in his right hand.

With his left shield, he flips several shadow dogs away, and then continues to smash the cranium of the shadow dog that looms before him with his battle axe.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell? What is it with these guys? Why are they doing this to us all of a sudden?

It's him! He did something!"

Kuso! Even though Master Orbet is watching! Ah? Guys! Who told you to move?

<blank>

Dag extended his black spear as he spotted Alan and the others dragging Will and Fiorina, who were unable to move.

<blank>

Beatrice, who had noticed the movement of the five men and was watching them, noticed that Doug had extended his black spear.

<blank>

Stonewall! ≪Stonewall, protect those kids!"

<blank>

Beatrice's stone wall slithered up to protect the five of them.

It was so thick and had a quartz-like luster and hardness that the stone walls up to this point had seemed like a meager impulse.

The black spear was easily bounced off its wall and dissipated.

Beatrice also froze, her eyes widening at the strength of the stone wall.

<blank>

Wow! Yikes! Hurry up, Belknap! Stefan!

<blank>

Surprised by the stone wall that suddenly appeared directly behind them, Alain called out to Belknap and Stefan and hurried them along.

Oh!　and the two nodded to each other, and the five of them rolled into the gap in the front line that Dana had opened.

<blank>

<blank>

And one more thing.

<blank>

When Suzy confirmed that the five had come to this side of the defense, a ripple of light spread around her as she said so.

<blank>

≪Vitality Release.

Skills of the Great Wiseman, a recovery job.

All HP and MP of all allies around you are restored.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Huh? Huh? The magic is back .........? No! More than that?

<blank>

Colin expressed his surprise that not only was the magic that had been nearly used up in the healing process fully restored, but that the amount of magic had increased significantly.

It's not just Colin, Beatrice, Willie, Mia and Carl, but it's not just the magic profession.

The vanguard who used magic for equipment..., William too.

<blank>

I'd like to know "Where is this ......? Why? ...me?"

<blank>

William regains consciousness and is surprised to find that there is nothing wrong with his body.

On the contrary, he felt a sense of fullness of energy and strength, as if after a well-deserved rest, or even more so, and could not hide his bewilderment.

<blank>

Will! Will! You noticed? Thank God! Will!

"Colin! Run? Can you stand? Where's your wound?

<blank>

Colin noticed William getting up and ran over to him.

William shouted in surprise at the sight of Colin running, but when he jumped in, William happily accepted him and hugged him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What's going on? How can he even get up?

Damn ......." But alas! The sun has already hidden itself below the horizon. Time's up! Playtime's over, ！！！！."

<blank>

Doug swung his right hand out vigorously, and the shadow spread at once.

Five or six humanoid figures with crocodile-like mouths crawled out of them.

Furthermore, there were also figures with pure white skin without blood.

Their red eyes glowing, they crawl out of the shadows as if they are overflowing.

Brutal bats came from the sky, and shadow docks came in like reinforcements from beyond the windbreak.

<blank>

"Oh, this many? No, there's no way out! There's no way out!

<blank>

Colin raised a voice that sounded like a scream.

<blank>

Sue! There's a ward here! We can't get out of here!"

<blank>

Beatrice briefly informed Susie of the situation.

<blank>

W... Warding?

<blank>

Suzy looked up at the sky and swung her right-hand sword upward as if it were slicing through the sky.

<blank>

Immediately afterwards, a crack of light appears in the space above.

The wards scattered and disappeared with a sound like shattering glass.

Everyone present, friend and foe alike, looked up at the sky and froze, their eyes wide open.

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell is that? That guy! What did he just do?

I don't know! I don't know! What the hell is going on?

<blank>

<blank>

Immediately, Suzy leaps on the spot, kicking the ground.

In the direction of the destroyed school building.

High like an arc.

<blank>

"Susie jumped?

"! God damn it! Why can't I see? Why can't I see it?

<blank>

Irving's surprise was evident.

I heard Alan's disturbing cries afterwards, but bobbing bobbing bobbing!　and the sound of being taco-knocked over, so Suzy decided to go through with it.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy turns her body vertically as she leaps and zaps the ground with her head down in the sky.

<blank>

(Vampire ...... two elder vampires. Shadow ghouls from their shadows? Seven from each of those shadows? And the white ones are Lesser Vampires? I'm getting a lot of small fry.... I want to use my range, but... it would be too dangerous if they reach everyone. I'll just have to destroy them one by one. ...... The dogs and bats are gathering all over the place, but they can be treated as small fry now, so I'll leave that one to you guys...)

<blank>

After a moment's thought, he drew his two swords again, pointed the tip of his sword at the ground, and fired his sword ki like a machine gun at his target, the "white target.

Lesser vampires pop off one after another.

The two vampires have no time to comprehend what is happening.

In an instant, I realized that all the servants I was supposed to have kept had disappeared.

<blank>

"Hey, what? What? What the fuck? What is it? What the hell?

<blank>

Doug shouted, but Suzy landed in front of the school building and swung her right-hand sword with great force as soon as her feet hit the ground.

The shockwave coming from its sword pressure cleaves the shadow ghouls.

Glogooooooo .........!　and emitted a decisive roar, and all the shadow ghouls fizzled out and disappeared.

<blank>

What the hell? What the hell is this? What the hell is this? What the hell are you?

<blank>

Doug shouts in confusion and looks around for his family members who should have been there.

Suzy tilted her head slightly, raising her eyebrows uncomfortably...

<blank>

You've been nagging me for the last hour.

<blank>

Before he knew it, he was standing in front of Doug, swinging his right-hand sword horizontally and slashing away.

<blank>

Na! Bubbo!

<blank>

The vampire, who was called Doug, exploded and scattered on the spot.

The white grains of salt scatter like spatter.

It dissolved into the atmosphere and disappeared, extinguishing its existence.

<blank>

Doug? Nah! What? You! What are you doing?

<blank>

Eliza immediately jumps back from the scene, her hands transformed into claws and screams....

<blank>

I told him to shut up.

<blank>

Suzy, who was standing behind him before he knew it, slashes up his left-hand sword and swings it away.

<blank>

Boo!

<blank>

As it was, the vampire called Eliza also scattered and scratched away in white.

<blank>

I'm not gonna give you any slack.

<blank>

With that, Suzy stared coldly into the void and placed the two swords into their sheaths at her waist.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When Susie returned to everyone, the twins, Clark and Ashton, were holding Fiorina and anxiously calling out to her several times.

<blank>

Fiorina is the only one who hasn't regained consciousness.

<blank>

Colin told Suzy anxiously as he poured healing magic into Fiorina.

<blank>

Susie was told that Fiorina had been deprived of her blood by a vampire.

Today, Henry taught me that vampire victims are deprived of their astral body and part of their manas.

The trapped souls will not be released until the vampire who took part of their souls is destroyed. ...... and

<blank>

The astral body should be depleted by the recovery of MP from the mana charge.

In fact, William, who was deprived of pure blood only, was revived by "Vitality Release" with full HP and MP, since he was unconscious due to MP depletion.

Manas also destroyed the vampire who took it from him.

The soul should be liberated.

Are you saying that the connection has not returned to consciousness?

If so, does this mean that he can be revived by restoring the connection between his body and his soul?

Susie thought so.

<blank>

<blank>

[Resuscitation].

Suzy does not believe that it is possible to raise the dead in this world.

In the game, there is a revival magic called "Resurrection" that can restore a person from a state of inability to fight, and I can use it myself.

However, it is hard to believe that the inability to fight in a game and death in this world can be talked about on the same level.

What if the inability to fight in the game is a fainting state in this world?

Once they regain consciousness, they can return to battle once more.

Yes, just as Will was right now!

What if the magic called "Resurrection" is just that?

If someone dies unexpectedly, there is nothing I can do to bring them back to life!

Isn't it reasonable to think so?

<blank>

Suzy had never thought of testing "Resurrection" before.

Wait for someone to die, or let them die and then use them, what if it doesn't work?

I shudder just thinking about it.

That's why I panicked so much when I sensed that Sonia might lose her life.

There is no such guarantee anywhere to bring people back to life, and people do not come back to life when they die.

It is a matter of course.

<blank>

However, if this "Resurrection" is a magic that can restore the soul connection, Fiorina may be able to wake up soon by using this magic.

The connection between the body and the manas should be thin, or even thin, but not broken.

Once, Dr. Henry was unable to save Mr. Ravi because his manas remained captive.

Now, Fiorina has no such fears.

We don't know if it is possible to bring the dead back to life.

But Fiorina is still alive now!

Then let's try it, let's try it!

<blank>

<blank>

Susie kneeled next to Fiorina and held out one hand to activate the magic.

<blank>

≪Resurrection.

<blank>

Light floods from Suzy's palm.

The warm light went around Fiorina's entire body.

The light eventually fades away as if melting into Fiorina.

<blank>

Suzy exhaled and stood up.

Fiorina's eyes, which had been closed, twitched and lifted their lids.

<blank>

Fiorina!"

<blank>

Clark and Ashton approached Fiorina together.

Fiorina's eyes widened in surprise.

<blank>

What? Huh? Why? Why?"

I'm so glad! Good, Fiorina! Thank God...!

<blank>

Colin took Fiorina from the twins and hugged her.

Fiorina, huh? What's that?　Fiorina was puzzled.

After checking on everyone and breathing a deep sigh of relief, Suzy turned her sharp gaze in the direction of the north.

<blank>

What's wrong? Sue!"

<blank>

Beatrice notices Suzy's gaze and asks.

<blank>

"Still here, 20, 30, more and more are coming toward us.

What?

<blank>

These words made not only Beatrice, but also the children present at the event, startled.

The new stone wall that Beatrice had deployed was powerful, and the shadow dogs were unable to break through and attack.

Still, there are things that jump over them.

Dana and Lombardo are still dealing with that.

The bat approaching from the sky was shot down by Mary's bow and two members of the magic group.

<blank>

But they're all small fry now, so they'll be fine. The enchiladas will stay like this for another hour, so they won't be a problem, and..."

<blank>

Susie raised her right hand above her head and snapped her fingers.

<blank>

Come! World Tree!

<blank>

A huge seed-like object descended rapidly from the sky above and pierced the ground.

Immediately, the outer skin of the tree opened up, and a trunk emerged from the inside and grew branches, becoming a young tree in no time at all.

<blank>

≪Samon Yggdrasil.

Great Wiseman Skills.

Summons a young tree of the world tree and gives the breath of life to those in its shade.

<blank>

If you stay at the base of her, even if you get hurt, you will heal quickly and your magic will be restored.

What? What? What is this? What is this? Sue-chan!

<blank>

Mia rolled her eyes and visited Suzy vigorously.

<blank>

I summoned a young ash tree, and she's going to be here for at least an hour, so don't worry.

<blank>

Suzy replied matter-of-factly.

A summoning technique in such a short time?　Beatrice peeled her white eyes and froze, her mouth agape.

<blank>

So, everybody just hang on a little bit longer."

Anta! What are you doing?

<blank>

Beatrice, who has regained her composure, asks Susie.

<blank>

"Yeah, there's no end in sight, so I'll just turn down the source and come back."

<blank>

Susie pulled her chin back and stared deep into the forest, out of sight from here.

<blank>

Will, Lombard, Belknap, protect them all."

Dana, Irving, Alan, Helena, take them down.

Mia, Carl, Mary, shoot the enemy."

Willie, Colin, Bibi, take care of everybody.

<blank>

Suzy goes to each one of them.

<blank>

Sue, I can do it! I can do it too! I can fight!"

Stefan can do it. With Helena, you know?"

I'll take care of you, sister! I'll protect you!

Yes, Helena, please, okay?"

<blank>

Suzy patted Stefan on the head and smiled at Helena.

I'm going to protect you!　Stefan was breathing, "I'm going to protect you!　Helena was proud of it and blew her breath out of her nose.

<blank>

We can fight, too!　Clark and Ashton exclaimed.

Lombardo drags the twins away.

<blank>

Sue!

Mupugyu!"

<blank>

Mia hugged me as hard as she could.

<blank>

Thanks, thanks, thanks." Sue-chan!"

No, Mia, that hurt, didn't it? I'm sorry I'm late."

I'm fine! I'm fine! Sue, are you ...... going to be okay on your own?"

Yeah, I'm fine. So, Mia, why don't you wait here with the others?"

<blank>

Suzy placed her hand on Mia's waist and spoke softly to her, looking into her eyes.

<blank>

Sue, thank you. Are you sure you can... go by yourself?"

Colin said, "Yeah, Colin, it's okay. So, Colin, take care of everybody."

I'll leave it to you! It won't take long, will it?

I'll take care of it, Bibi! I'm on it, Bibi, and I'll have this done in less than 30 minutes, okay?"

I'm counting on you, Sue! You got it!

Yeah! Dana! I'm in charge!

<blank>

Dana raised her right fist and shouted, to which Suzy responded by raising her right fist as well.

<blank>

I'll be right back, okay? I'll be right back, okay?"

Go on, Sue! And! Get them out of here!

<blank>

Beatrice's words! Suzy nodded with a big smile.

He kicked the ground and ran toward the forest to the north.

Then, a shadow dog jumped out from the top of the stone wall in front of us.

Suzy slashes at it as if passing it by, and then speeds off into the forest.

The children who were watching them were in awe.

<blank>

Come on! Come on! If these guys aren't cleaned up when Sue gets back! We won't be able to face her!

<blank>

Beatrice sent everyone into a fury.

Oh, oh, oh!　and the battle cries of children echo through the area as they shake the earth.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Susie runs in a straight line into the forest, heading for several eradication targets.

We crushed every dog and bat we saw along the way.

<blank>

(First of all, the guys who give these guys their orders. Evil Warwolves and Evil Warbats. With "Evil" on their heads! It's so easy to understand! They are definitely giving orders to the dogs and bats to unify their will. If we destroy them, they will be nothing more than a bunch of rabble-rousers. And the worst of all is this "Evil War Rat"! But first, we must crush the dogs and bats quickly!)

<blank>

I heard a squeaky voice at my shoulder.

<blank>

"Algernon, are you sure? Are you sure you don't want to stay with Bibi?"

<blank>

Kiki-kikikyuu No problem! and squealing rodents.

<blank>

So, if you're out there, it's not safe for you to be out here, okay?"

<blank>

The rodent opened its finger to indicate its chest, and the rodent let out a single squeak and dove into the chest.

<blank>

Oh..! Oh, no, don't... don't... don't... don't move, okay?"

<blank>

Kikyu? and a rodent's eye that squeaks. Suzy, whose cheeks are always stained even in such a situation. It's a wonder she's still alive.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy rushed into the woods.

The closer we get to our target, the more shadow dogs there are, but it doesn't matter. We cut them all into pieces and push forward.

Flesh and blood were scattered throughout the forest, but Suzy deftly avoided the blood splatter, not a single stain on any part of her attire.

Then, the target was sighted.

<blank>

(Found it! Evil Warwolves!!!!)

<blank>

A black wolf standing on two legs, reaching two meters in height.

Before she even had time to recognize Suzy, she was slashed into a pulp by the woman who had just passed by her.

Susie turns her body and stops, as if she is dancing on the spot.

At the same time, the surviving shadow dogs around them turned into flesh and blood and scattered.

Susie looked up at the western sky as it was.

The bats are swarming in the sky above us.

Among them, only one large individual can be identified that jumps out of the water.

<blank>

(Evil Warbat confirmed! Let's blow them all up together... We're in the sky, we'll be fine, right?)

<blank>

Suzy flies her skills toward the target with the tip of her sword.

<blank>

≪Impact Storm≫.

Dueling Barbarians' long-range ranged attack skills.

<blank>

With a low burst, the target warbat was blown away, along with the surrounding bats.

One can only see black dust dancing in the space where the skill exploded.

And one more thing.

Suzy carefully focused her Ki on a target floating a short distance away and took aim.

<blank>

"Don't bomb... don't bomb..."

<blank>

He squeezed his "Ki" to the very limit and fired at the target.

The target is crushed only in the lower half of the body as aimed, and falls to the ground with a cone rub.

He checked it out and was satisfied!　and let the breath fly out of his nose.

He was satisfied with the exquisite control work of his "Ki".

<blank>

Well, now for the most important target! As I was about to move out of the way, I noticed a number of signs coming toward me.

<blank>

(Is this... the shadow ghoul I blew up at school earlier? Are they coming straight at me? There are so many of them. Is there another Elder Vampire? Is this the same one that was at the school earlier? Four in all...what the heck! I don't have time to deal with these things!)

<blank>

Hmmm!　and put his hands on his hips and blew his breath out through his nose.

He swung his sword away with great force, and just as before, the shadow ghouls were dissipated by a shockwave carrying Ki.

The vampire is coming towards you, and you will fire your sword at the vampire.

One, two, three. He shot them consecutively and detonated them.

The remaining one was close by, so I approached it in one breath and swung my sword at it, causing it to explode and scatter.

<blank>

All right, that's it! I've spent too much time! I've wasted so much of your time!"

<blank>

Susie immediately started running. She ran to the location of the final target.

And I knew it right away.

<blank>

<blank>

The closer we got, the more the rustling and rustling sound echoed around us like a huge chorus.

The forest was filled with the smell of a beast that seemed to be swallowing.

It was not enough to stain the surface of the forest black, but it was a huge pulsating black mass, writhing around in multiple layers of black waves, repeatedly spilling out and rising again and again.

And in that mass, a great number of red, flickering lights.

<blank>

Mad Lemmings.

About 30 centimeters long. It is one or two times larger than Algernon.

It has jet-black fur and red eyes that burn like mad. Its fangs are long and sharp. It could easily eat away at children's leather armor.

The number is about 12,000.

It waits here, wriggling around, waiting for orders so that it can avalanche into the village at any moment.

And the person who issues the order is.

<blank>

(You! Evil Worratt!!!!!!!)

<blank>

Just when I was about to take on the challenge of that goal.

<blank>

　and the rodent's eyes flailed around in Suzy's clothes.

<blank>

Aaan! Hyun! Nnnn! Aaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!"

<blank>

Susie's hips shattered and she sat up on the spot.

<blank>

Oh! Oh...silly! Ng! Arjano! Don't move! I said... didn't I? I said...!

<blank>



<blank>

I'm not going to let you do it! That's why! Don't expose us...no! ！！！！

<blank>

Algernon crawls out from Suzy's chest, who is trembling for some reason, and makes a face, saying "Kikikikyukyuu" as if to say something.

<blank>

"Oh, no... What? You knew they were here... and you followed them, didn't you? Why are you in such a hurry now?

<blank>

Susie asks Algernon, her cheeks slightly tinted and her breath uneven.

<blank>



<blank>

What? You didn't think there'd be this many of them? You didn't expect this?"

<blank>

Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu!

<blank>

"Too bad? Let's hurry up and get the hell out of here."

<blank>

Squeak squeak!

<blank>

I'm here because I'm in trouble! If you're scared, you can go home now!"

<blank>

Crikey crikey...

<blank>

Then get in there like a big boy! Don't move, okay? You can... come... back... and we can have a nice little playdate, okay?"

<blank>

Cicu?

<blank>

Oh, uh, anyway! Don't move! Can I?"

<blank>

cuckoo

<blank>

Then I'm going, I'm going!"

<blank>

Suzy stood up and clapped her hands on her chest as if to reiterate.

Then he gripped the two swords in both hands again and started running toward his target.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The 12,000 or so mud lemmings were climbing on top of each other to stay in one place, overlapping each other, forming a blackened heap, and writhing fearlessly.

<blank>

If this horde were to be unleashed on the village, it would be untouchable.

I can't imagine how long it would take to eradicate them one by one.

<blank>

Then now is a good time to get it together.

If we just annihilate them, there will be no problem.

But how powerful would it be to use a ranged skill to destroy such a large number of people? I can't imagine this either.

Just be sure that the village will definitely be affected.

A picture of a flying mountain range flashed in my mind, and I shivered.

<blank>

No range skills are used!

But it is still about bringing it all together and eradicating it.

Let's try to find a place where there will be as little damage to the forest as possible.

Fortunately, there is a nearby, affordable place.

First of all, we have to lead them there.

<blank>

Suzy accelerated and leaped at once.

He jumped over the top of the black mountain and released his skill directly above it.

<blank>

≪'Spread Hate'.

Skills for the shield position "Sentinel Knight".

A skill that provokes surrounding enemies and forces them to target you.

<blank>

Until then, the black mountain had been showing at least steady, if not quiet, movement, but when it was hit by the skill, the whole area rippled as if it were exploding.

Suzy further uses another skill against their rulers.

<blank>

≪'bound with chains'.

Also a "Sentinel Knight" skill.

The target is drawn to the chain, making himself the target of the attack.

<blank>

Suzy caught the Evil Worratt by the chain and pulled him in just before he landed.

He grabs its head carelessly and drags it running.

The Evil Worrats are sounding furious, their anger directed at Suzy.

<blank>

Evil Worrats are the commanding force behind Mad Lemmings.

If you take this guy's hate, the target of this herd will inevitably turn on you.

Suzy continued to provoke the warrats by dragging them along and also using "hate" for a single person.

<blank>

Susie ran straight through the forest.

Soon after, we arrive at an open area.

The space, with a diameter of about 30 meters, is one of the many battle points in the forest, the same place where Suzy and Howard first met.

This is a somewhat larger plaza than others. This is the place to decide.

<blank>

With a gussied-up grip on the warrat's head, which is flailing about in an even angrier rage, he leaps from between the trees and glides into the center of the plaza.

He then used his momentum to reduce Warratt's head to the ground on the landing.

<blank>

You're buried in there!

<blank>

Worlat's head fell to the ground and he panicked, but there was nothing he could do.

Soon, the black mass rushes in as a tsunami.

When the first group entered the plaza, he once again applied "Spread Hate" to them.

Black waves pulsed loudly, revealing anger.

As if it wanted to crush Susie, it became a huge tsunami and came at her.

But Suzy quickly leapt back from the center of the square to the edge.

He then continued to wait for the black wave to catch up with him and began to run counterclockwise around the outer perimeter.

<blank>

Following Suzy, a huge wave begins to circle around the square.

Suzy goes around the square, adjusting her speed so as not to leave the black wave behind or be overtaken by it.

Eventually, it catches up with Kurohami, but continues to circle with a smaller diameter.

Suzy runs further, trampling the mad lemmings that catch up to her.

Some of them jumped to their feet, but Suzy couldn't even snatch them.

<blank>

Eventually, by gradually reducing the number of laps run, the square becomes a whirlpool of black waves.

Suzy reached the center where the Evil Worrats were buried, where she kicked the ground and leaped into the air.

The trampled warrats were crushed along with the heavily caved-in ground.

The mad lemmings around them are blown away by the impact, creating a doughnut-shaped hole in the black vortex.

But soon after, it began chasing Suzy, trampling her friends, running up and climbing, a high whirlpool climbing up.

<blank>

The vortex rose like a tornado, trying to catch up to Suzy, who was reaching 3 to 40 meters above.

Its appearance is a black tower of Babel.

<blank>

As it nears the point of arrival and its rate of ascent slows, Suzy sees a black vortex below.

OK! Almost all of it was contained within the plaza grounds!

He pulled out one of his swords with his right hand, gathered magic power, and thrust it toward the center of the vortex.

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Suzy Cloud, daughter of Cloud, who is a member of Amukam, seeks and appeals to Salamander, the Great Guide of the Fire. With his flame, strike down my enemies! ≪FIRE BREAD!"

<blank>

It is not our own offensive magic, but a celebration of the spirit magic we have learned here.

The magic used is the same magic that Carl used, which shoots out elementary fireballs.

However, the amount of magic power used for its use was different. The magic value invoked was off the charts.

The size of the fireball that manifested there was over five meters in diameter.

A huge mass of dense flame shot out with a roar, instantly burning and scattering the black tower like paper and shooting away the ground.

The fireball gutted the ground in an area of about 50 meters square and turned it into charcoal.

<blank>

"・・・・・・・・・・・・・"

<blank>

Suzy looks at the ground as she descends, bites her lip inward and breaks out in a grand cold sweat.

<blank>

Did I... overdo it?

<blank>

 　and the rodent's face emerged from Suzy's chest and began to make a commotion, as if excited.

<blank>

Aahhhh! Nyun nyun nyun nyun nyun! So! That's why! Don't let them find out......no! ...tee...baaaah...! Nnnn!

<blank>

Suzy collapses, holding her chest.

<blank>

Kickee! Kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki kikki! Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu! Kikikikyukyukyukyukyukyukyukyukyukyukyukyuk!   squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak squeak!

Wow! This many swarms in just one moment? It's too much! Miss! From now on, you can think of me as your brother! I'll follow you! Miss!

<blank>

I don't know, I don't know what you just said, but... you seemed strangely condescending, or was that just my imagination?"

<blank>

Still breathing a little raggedly, Suzy, her eyebrows raised, looked down at Algernon and muttered, "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this.

Algernon looked up at Suzy with a laughing "kikkikkikkieu.

<blank>

Oh! Oh, no! I've got to get rid of the last one! Algernon! If you're gonna follow me, you'd better behave this time, okay?

<blank>

Kikyuu!　and rodent eyes that only respond well.

<blank>

Suzy tucked Algernon back into her chest and began to move.

The goal is to get to the main culprit, probably this time the one who shot down and left earlier.

When I was tagged, I knew this guy was a "True Vampire".

I think you mean true ancestors?　Susie thinks.

<blank>

(I'd like to get rid of the infidels who attack this village as soon as possible, but since they're true vampires, they've probably been here for a long time. (I'd like to get rid of the infidels who are attacking our village as soon as possible, but since they are true vampires, they've probably been around for a long time.)

<blank>

It was easy to find.

A sickening presence hangs over the area.

To Susie, it looked like this guy was using a sprinkler to spread the sewage.

<blank>

Ugh, what a creep."

<blank>

That was Susie's impression when she found the thing floundering on the ground.

I don't mean that it looks like it.

The atmosphere that it emitted around the area was full of a sense of impurity, as if it was spreading filth.

<blank>

You're the boss?

<blank>

Suzy asked with a raised eyebrow as she looked down at Sole at her feet.

The presence it emits is so fearless that I feel as if I am looking at excrement and cannot look directly at it.

<blank>

What the hell did you do? What the hell did you do? What did you do with those kids?

<blank>

The vampire bared his fangs and glared down at Suzy with veins floating in his skin.

<blank>

What did you do? He attacked me, so I just kicked his ass, okay?"

<blank>

What is this guy talking about? Suzy replied.

<blank>

I have a question, though.

<blank>

It doesn't matter, he asked with a wave of his palm.

<blank>

You know what a child eater is, don't you?

<blank>

The vampire opens his eyes and looks up at Suzy in surprise.

<blank>

Are you serious?"

<blank>

Susie raised her eyebrows in disgust.

<blank>

Do you know? Don't you know? If you don't know, that's okay.

I'm Orbet Mash! I am Orbet Mash! I am the noble being you lowly mortals call 'Childeater'!

<blank>

Susie raised her eyebrows more and more and looked down at the being that was crawling on the ground and emitting an aura of filth.

<blank>

"Or... bed? Soo-ko? I didn't know your name, but... yeah, you're... you're... you're... you're... you're... you're... you're... you're...

Damn it! What do you mean? Those kids are nowhere to be found! Why? Why can't I get my body back? Damn it! What did you do to me? What the hell did you do to me?

<blank>

Orbet's lower body, which had been crushed by Suzy, was still crumbling slightly, with white smoke billowing out of it without being repaired.

<blank>

Damn it! Damn it! My body! You human! What have you done to my body? You're nothing but food for us! Know your place! Humans! Damn you!

<blank>

... hmmm."

<blank>

Suzy relaxes her shoulders and holds the two swords down with both hands, and stands swaying, looking down at Orbet coldly with narrowed eyes.

<blank>

What's that look in your eye? You've got to be kidding me! What is it with these villagers? Like that old man, you are a lowly creature! Wait and see! I'll mend your wounds right now, and I'll feed you myself! You should feel honored! Oh, by the way, you have red hair, too? Ha ha! This reminds me of a girl I once had in this village! Satisfy me as much as you did that time! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Then it was the old man! I'm going to rip that old fool to shreds! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

You're the one who's been confirmed. And now I know you're just as much a pig as I am. And, uh... yeah, Howard, Dad..."

<blank>

Susie took her gaze away from Orbet and looked into the distance, her eyes narrowed lovingly.

<blank>

What? Don't play with me! You can't put me together with a pig like you! You trashy worm! Damn you! Why? Why can't I get my body back? Damn you, damn you! What the hell did you do? Is it the priest's technique? What the hell? What are you? I didn't know there was anyone like you! Who are you?

<blank>

Suzy sheathes her sword as she does so.

<blank>

I'm Suzy Cloud... I'm Suzy Cloud. I am Suzy, daughter of Howard Cloud and Sonia Cloud. Yes... I am Suzy Cloud! Their daughter! Susie Cloud!

<blank>

Susie announces my name loudly and proudly.

His face was satisfied, and his smile was full of joy.

Kikyu and Rodent also poked their heads out of their chests and looked up into Suzy's proud face.

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell is this guy talking about ......?"

<blank>

Orbet mutters to himself.

He squinted at the orbette and continued, "And then..." He continued, "I've had enough of this.

<blank>

"When people die, they don't come back. A dead person's wounds don't heal, okay?"

<blank>

Didn't you know?　Suzy tells Orbet.

<blank>

What? What are you saying? I am immortal! I am an immortal being who has transcended death! I am the ruler of the dark night! I am the master of the dark night!

<blank>

Suzy cowered her shoulders in disgust and exhaled.

<blank>

"Right? I'm just following the natural order, right? Besides..."

<blank>

He pointed his finger in the distance as if trying to gauge the distance and muttered, "That way," and then he ran to Orbette and ...... her body.

<blank>

thud

<blank>

I kicked him as hard as I could.

<blank>

"Bokyabobo ！！！！"

<blank>

Orbet's body arcs and flies beyond the forest.

<blank>

I don't care how good you are. I can't picture you beating Howard Dad, not even for a second!

<blank>

He put his hands on his hips and turned his mouth into a grunt and said to Orbet, who was no longer there.

<blank>

Well," he said! We have to clean up! There are dogs and bats scattered all over the village, so we have to clean up!

<blank>

With his hands on his hips, he looked backward and muttered.

The rodent's eyes, which poke out from the chest, also answer with a kikku.

<blank>

By the time I'm done cleaning up, Howard's dad will be done, so I'm going to have to give him a workout!"

<blank>

Cicu!

<blank>

Then go back to school, to your friends! Algernon!

<blank>

Kikikikyuu! and the rodent's eyes squealing happily.

Suzy ran straight through the forest and back into the village.
