# Chapter 39: Suzy Cloud Steps Forward

The gloomy developments are over.

----------------

<b>

"Ah, ahahaha, I don't think it's going to be easy to keep them alive, you know? Hey? What are you planning to do? These kids are all on the verge of dying, right? Hey? Ahahahahahahaha!"

<b>

Doug raised his right hand as if signaling something while laughing.

<b>

<b>

Suzy stepped forward with a swift motion.

<b>

"Vivi, Irvin, just wait a moment, I'll finish it quickly, okay?"

<b>

As Suzy spoke, she helped Irvin to sit up and passed by Beatrice, who was supporting him.

Algernon watched from beside Beatrice with a "kikikyu" sound.

<b>

"Su...?"

<b>

Beatrice stared wide-eyed at Suzy's back.

<b>

"......What's wrong... Vivi?"

<b>

Irvin, enduring the intense pain in his arm, asked Beatrice, who had stopped moving.

<b>

"......That kid... is cut off."

<b>

<b>

<b>

The shadow dogs that had been attached to the three at the front suddenly started running towards Suzy, except for one.

<b>

The last one, without hesitation, sank its fangs into Helena's neck, as if following some command.

<b>

"Ahg! Guuh!!"

"Ah! Th-this guy! Wait... Ugh! Damn it!!"

<b>

Helena let out a groan from the sudden sharp pain.

Dana tried to chase after the shadow dog that bit Helena, but due to the injury on her calf, she couldn't step forward and ended up kneeling.

The shadow dog that had bitten Helena joined the others and started running.

At that moment, Suzy squinted as she noticed the shadow dog's mouth curling up in a malicious grin.

<b>

"What’s that? Planning to use her as a hostage?"

<b>

Suzy tilted her head and shot a cold glare at the shadow dog.

She raised her chin and moved forward. Then, her body swayed gently.

<b>

Suzy's skirt fluttered lightly.

<b>

In the next moment, a sword sprouted from the side of the shadow dog that was biting Helena.

<b>

A silver blade extended from the left side of the shadow dog's face.

On the opposite side was Suzy's left hand gripping the sword's hilt.

As Suzy swiftly opened her arm, the shadow dog's upper jaw and head were cleanly severed from its body, as if cutting through a piece of fruit.

The remaining shadow dog, now half its head missing, slowly collapsed to the ground.

Suzy caught Helena's body with her right hand to prevent her from falling and pulled her away from the shadow dog's body.

<b>

"Suzy... big sister...?"

"Helena... you did well, great job."

"S-Suzy, big sister... I, I!"

"Don't worry, I'll heal you now."

<b>

The five shadow dogs that had been heading towards Suzy suddenly lost sight of her and began sniffing the ground as if searching for her scent.

However, they quickly found a target behind them and started running towards Suzy again.

<b>

<b>

≪Chain Regeneration≫

A skill of the healing class "Great Wise Man."

Connecting all allies with a line of vitality centered on oneself, it rapidly regenerates HP and continues to restore vitality for a short time.

<b>

A golden line of light ran across the ground, extending to all the children present.

<b>

"O-Oh, big sister...? W-What is this?!"

<b>

Helena's body was filled with a warm sensation, and her wounds healed rapidly as her stamina returned.

Helena checked her own body and let out a voice of astonishment.

<b>

<b>

The other children also recovered and stood up.

Dana, Lombard, Karl, Irvin, Colin, Mia, and Mary.

Alan, Bernap, and Stefan, as well as all the children from the training ground, stood up one after another.

Only Fiorina and William, who had their blood drained, still did not move.

<b>

<b>

"Whoa! What is this?! My arm can move?!"

"Ah, Irvin?... Amazing."

<b>

Beatrice exclaimed in surprise as she saw Irvin's arm, which had been repeatedly bitten by the shadow dogs and exposed to the bone, healing beautifully.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah, huh? Doesn't it hurt? ...Huh?"

"Mia?! I can't believe it... I'm so glad... so glad, Mia...! Ah! Uh... um, Mia? Y-you should probably put this on... maybe."

<b>

Mia's side, where she had been gouged by a black spear, healed perfectly, but her torn clothing exposed her skin, and her ample bosom was about to spill out from the torn fabric.

Willie, blushing as he tried to cover her, took off his cape and draped it over Mia's shoulder.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah! My legs!! Amazing! I can move so much!"

"Wow! It feels like my strength is coming back!"

<b>

Dana jumped in place, twirling her spear and striking the shadow dog's snout.

Lombard's hand, holding the tower shield, regained its strength.

<b>

<b>

"I can stand! I can walk! This is amazing, Su... everyone! Are you all okay?!"

<b>

Colin's call prompted the twins, Clark and Ashton, who were receiving treatment at the training ground, as well as Charles, Thomas, Layla, and Virgil, to shout out that they were safe.

<b>

Outside the training ground, Karl stood up while checking the places on his body where he had been injured, and Mary wiped the blood from her forehead, surprised to see that her wounds had disappeared.

<b>

Furthermore, on the other side of the stone wall...

<b>

"What happened?!... Huh? What?! Fiorina?!... Whoa?! Will is here too?! Hey! Bernap! Can you move?"

"Yeah! No problem. What about you, Alan?"

"Absolutely fine! Hey! Stefan! You can move too, right?!"

"Totally okay!!"

"Alright! I don't know what's going on, but it looks like the enemies are standing still! Bernap and I will drag Will away, so Stefan! You take Fiorina! We need to get out of here fast!"

<b>

Bernap and Stefan nodded, dragging the two who still had their eyes closed out of the spot.

<b>

<b>

"This is just a bonus."

<b>

With that, Suzy drew the two swords hanging at her waist and raised both hands above her head.

Holding the swords above her, she closed her eyes and swayed her body gently to a steady rhythm.

And what escaped her lips was...

<b>

"A song? ...Suzy... big sister...? ...!!"

<b>

Helena was surprised by Suzy's appearance and widened her eyes, just as the returning shadow dogs leaped at Suzy.

By the time Helena noticed, the fangs were already inches away from Suzy.

The fangs of the shadow dog sank into Suzy's body!

At that moment, the shadow dog's fangs cut through the air uselessly, and its body passed by Suzy without touching her.

All five shadow dogs landed without being able to touch Suzy.

<b>

What happened was incomprehensible to both the shadow dogs and Helena, who was watching in front of her.

Still, the shadow dogs leaped again.

But again, they couldn't even graze Suzy.

<b>

Suzy, unconcerned by the situation, swayed gently, humming a song, and began to dance.

Soon, the children began to hear sounds that were different from the song.

<b>

"Huh? Is that a guitar?"

"The drums are playing."

"Is that the sound of an organ?"

"This is a lute, right?"

"I can hear a harp too."

<b>

"A spirit... orchestra?"

<b>

Helena blurted out, turning her gaze back to Suzy.

<b>

Illuminated by the setting sun sinking on the horizon, her fiery red hair shimmered as it danced.

The silver sword sliced through the golden light.

In that light, Suzy swayed gracefully, dancing.

Her expression, bathed in the sunset, was very gentle and calm, making Helena feel as if she were gazing upon a divine being.

Helena's heart was filled with warmth.

<b>

At the same time, she felt a surge of strength within her body.

Helena's senses were sharper than ever before.

At that moment, she saw a shadow dog preparing to charge again, kicking off the ground.

Helena held two daggers in reverse grip and swiftly slid her body into the line between the shadow dog and Suzy.

<b>

"I won't let you interfere with my big sister...!! You insolent creature!!!"

<b>

Helena aimed her right dagger at the shadow dog's mouth, intending to break its fangs.

<b>

Helena's dagger sliced straight through the shadow dog's lower fangs, severing its lower jaw in one stroke.

She then crouched low, entering the space of the next shadow dog that charged in, and from there, she extended her body and swung her left dagger inward.

The dagger sliced through the shadow dog's abdomen, spilling its entrails.

<b>

"What?! Huh? Huh?!"

<b>

Helena couldn't hide her surprise at her own sudden movements and the power of her attack.

At that moment, a sharp flash of a sword gleamed.

It was Irvin's longsword.

<b>

Irvin, confirming that his wounds had healed, picked up his longsword and charged at the shadow dogs surrounding Suzy.

With an upward slash, he easily sliced through the shadow dog's abdomen, killing it instantly.

He then swung the longsword down, striking the face of the second shadow dog.

The shadow dog's skull split in two, and it was slain.

<b>

"What the hell is this? Why is it so easy?"

<b>

Irvin also raised a voice of astonishment at the power he wielded.

Suddenly, a loud sound echoed from behind.

At the same time, a large hole appeared in the face of the last shadow dog.

It was Karl's ≪Fire Bullet≫ launched from behind.

<b>

"W-What the?! What power?!!"

<b>

Karl also raised a surprised voice.

<b>

<b>

Mary dodged a brutal bat that swooped down and shot an arrow from behind.

The arrows that had barely pierced skin moments ago now penetrated deeply with force.

The arrowhead shot straight through the vital point, bringing down the brutal bat.

Mary was astonished by her own accuracy and the power of her bow.

<b>

<b>

"Kelmu Eigo Espero Eude. The daughter of Mathison, Mia Mathison, who is connected to Amukam, calls upon the water's administrators, the Nymphs. With the power of the flow of water, grant us the ability to annihilate our enemies! ≪Water Cutter≫"

<b>

Mia chanted the incantation and pointed both index fingers towards the brutal bat above.

A stream of water, as thin as a thread, shot straight up from her fingertips.

As Mia moved her fingers apart, the stream of water sliced the brutal bat in half, causing it to fall to the ground like a withered leaf.

<b>

"Whoa, whoa! What is this? I can reach that far? I can take down something that big? Whoa!"

<b>

Mia's eyes widened in astonishment, and Willie, who was watching beside her, was left speechless.

<b>

<b>

Dana twirled her spear and scooped up a shadow dog from below.

With the shadow dog losing its footing in mid-air, Dana thrust her spear into it repeatedly.

After pulling out the spear that had struck the vital point, she twirled it towards the next shadow dog.

<b>

Lombard held his tower shield with one hand, gripping the battle axe he had at his waist with the other.

He knocked several shadow dogs away with the shield and then smashed the head of the approaching shadow dog with the battle axe.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What the hell?! What are these guys?! Why are they suddenly like this?!!"

"That guy! That guy did something!!"

"Damn it! Lord Olbet is watching! Ah?! You guys! Who said you could move?!!!"

<b>

Seeing Alan and the others dragging the immobile Will and Fiorina, Doug extended his black spear.

<b>

Noticing the movements of the five, Beatrice, who had been observing, realized that Doug had extended his black spear.

<b>

"We can't let that happen! ≪Stone Wall≫ Protect those kids!!"

<b>

Beatrice's stone wall rose up to protect the five.

It was so thick that the previous stone walls seemed like flimsy partitions, radiating a brilliance and hardness like quartz.

The black spear was easily deflected by that wall and dissipated.

Beatrice's eyes widened in shock at the strength of the stone wall, "No way..."

<b>

"Whoa, whoa! This is bad! Hurry, Bernap! Stefan!"

<b>

Startled by the sudden appearance of the stone wall behind them, Alan called out to Bernap and Stefan, urging them to hurry.

"Okay!" the two nodded, rolling into the gap in the battle line that Dana had opened.

<b>

<b>

"One more thing, as a bonus."

<b>

After confirming that the five had come to this side of the defense, Suzy said, and a ripple of light spread from her.

<b>

≪Vitality Release≫

A skill of the healing class Great Wise Man.

Fully restores the HP and MP of allies around her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Huh? Huh? My magic power... is coming back? No, even more than that??"

<b>

Colin exclaimed in surprise as he realized that not only had his magic power, which had been nearly depleted from healing, fully recovered, but it had also significantly increased.

It wasn't just Colin; Beatrice, Willie, Mia, and Karl all felt the same, and it wasn't limited to magic users.

The frontliners who had used magic on their equipment... even William.

<b>

"Ugh... Where am I? Why? ...What?"

<b>

William regained consciousness and was surprised to find no abnormalities in his body.

On the contrary, he felt a sense of vitality and energy as if he had taken a sufficient rest, even more than that, and he couldn't hide his confusion.

<b>

"Will! Will!! You’re awake?! Thank goodness! Will!"

"Colin?! Are you running? Can you stand?! What about your injuries?!!"

<b>

Noticing William standing up, Colin rushed over.

William was surprised by Colin's running but happily embraced him as Colin jumped into his arms.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What’s going on? Why can he stand up too?!"

"Damn it...! But unfortunately! The sun has already hidden below the horizon. Time's up!! The playtime is over!!!!"

<b>

Doug swung his right hand vigorously, causing his shadow to spread out rapidly.

From within it, five or six humanoid figures with crocodile-like mouths crawled out.

Furthermore, there were human figures with skin devoid of blood.

With red eyes shining, they crawled out of the shadows, overflowing with eagerness.

And from the sky, brutal bats and shadow dogs rushed in as reinforcements.

<b>

"Such a number?! No way! Our escape route!!"

<b>

Colin screamed in a voice resembling a shriek.

<b>

"Su! There's a barrier here! We can't get out from here!"

<b>

Beatrice quickly conveyed the situation to Suzy.

<b>

"...A barrier?"

<b>

Suzy looked up suspiciously and swung her right sword upwards as if to slice through the sky.

<b>

Immediately, a crack of light appeared in the space above.

With a sound like breaking glass, the barrier shattered and disappeared.

Everyone present, both enemies and allies, looked up at the sky in shock, their eyes wide open.

<b>

"W-What the hell?! What did she just do?!!!"

"I don't know! I have no idea!! What the hell is going on?!!!"

<b>

Immediately, Suzy kicked off the ground and leaped.

Towards the direction of the destroyed school building.

In an arc, high into the air.

<b>

"Did Suzy just jump?!!"

"What?! Damn it! Why can't I see her?!!"

<b>

Irvin's voice of astonishment rose.

He heard Alan's uneasy shout afterward, but decided to ignore it as he heard the sound of being pummeled.

<b>

Suzy spun her body vertically while jumping, checking the ground below her as she faced downwards.

<b>

(Vampires... two Elder Vampires. From their shadows, Shadow Ghouls? Seven from each shadow? And the white one is a Lesser Vampire? It looks like a bunch of weaklings are swarming in. I want to use an area attack, but... it would be too dangerous if it reached everyone. I guess I'll have to squash them one by one... The dogs and bats are gathering, but with those kids now, I can treat them as weaklings, so I'll leave that to everyone♪)

<b>

In an instant, she thought that much and drew her two swords again, aiming the sword tips towards the ground, and began to unleash a barrage of sword energy at the "white target."

The Lesser Vampires burst one after another.

The two Vampires had no time to comprehend what was happening.

Before they knew it, all the minions they had kept had vanished in an instant.

<b>

"W-What? What? What the hell is this?!!"

<b>

Doug shouted in confusion, looking around for the minions that should have been there.

Suzy tilted her head, looking displeased as she furrowed her brows...

<b>

"You've been noisy since earlier."

<b>

Suddenly standing in front of Doug, she swung her right sword horizontally.

<b>

"Wha?! B-buh?!"

<b>

The vampire called Doug exploded on the spot.

White salt-like particles scattered.

They dissolved into the atmosphere, erasing their existence.

<b>

"Doug?! W-What the?! What did you do?!!!"

<b>

Eliza immediately jumped back from the spot, her hands transforming into claws as she screamed...

<b>

"That's why I said, you're noisy."

<b>

Suzy, who had suddenly appeared behind her, swung her left sword upward.

<b>

"Boah?!"

<b>

The vampire called Eliza also scattered into white particles and vanished.

<b>

"I have no intention of holding back against you."

<b>

With that, Suzy glared coldly into the void.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When Suzy returned to everyone, Clark and Ashton were holding Fiorina, worriedly calling out to her repeatedly.

<b>

"Fiorina is the only one who hasn't regained consciousness."

<b>

Colin said, pouring healing magic into Fiorina while looking worriedly at Suzy.

<b>

Suzy learned that Fiorina had her blood drained by a vampire.

Today, she had learned from Henry that a victim of a vampire loses part of their astral body and mana.

Until the vampire that took a part of the soul is destroyed, the captured soul cannot be freed...

<b>

The depletion of the astral body should have been restored by MP recovery from mana charge.

In fact, William, who had purely lost blood, had lost consciousness due to MP depletion, but he had revived with HP and MP fully restored thanks to ≪Vitality Release≫.

The mana should also have been reclaimed since the vampire that took it had been destroyed.

If her consciousness isn't returning, does that mean the connection hasn't been restored?

If so, then restoring the connection between the body and soul should allow for resurrection.

Suzy thought about this.

<b>

<b>

【Resurrection】

Suzy did not believe that she could resurrect the dead in this world.

There exists a resurrection magic called ≪Resurrection≫ that can bring someone back from a state of incapacitation in the game, and she could use it.

However, she found it hard to believe that the incapacitation in the game could be equated with death in this world.

What if the incapacitation in the game was akin to a fainting state in this world?

If one regains consciousness, they could return to battle once more.

Just like how Will was doing right now!

What if the magic called ≪Resurrection≫ was just that?

If someone were to meet an untimely death, she would not be able to bring them back!

It would be reasonable to think that way.

<b>

Suzy had never considered verifying ≪Resurrection≫ until now.

Waiting for someone to die, or using it after someone dies, what if it didn't work out?

Just thinking about it sent chills down her spine.

That's why she panicked so much when she felt Sonia might lose her life.

There is no guarantee that one can bring someone back to life, and once a person dies, they do not come back.

That is a matter of course.

<b>

But what if this ≪Resurrection≫ is a magic that can restore the connection of the soul? If so, using it might allow Fiorina to wake up immediately.

The connection between the body and mana should be thin or weak, but it shouldn't be severed.

Once, Henry-sensei couldn't save Lavie because her mana was still captured.

Now, Fiorina should not have that concern.

Whether or not she can resurrect the dead is uncertain.

But Fiorina is still alive!

Then let's try it, let's give it a shot!

<b>

Suzy knelt beside Fiorina, raised one hand, and activated the magic.

<b>

≪Resurrection≫

<b>

Light overflowed from Suzy's palm.

The warm light enveloped Fiorina's entire body.

Gradually, the light slowly melted into Fiorina.

<b>

With a sigh, Suzy stood up.

Fiorina, who had her eyes closed, twitched and slowly opened her eyelids.

<b>

"Fiorina!!"

<b>

Clark and Ashton called out to Fiorina in unison.

Fiorina opened her eyes in surprise.

<b>

"Huh? What? Why? How?"

"I'm so glad! I'm so glad, Fiorina! I'm so glad...!!"

<b>

Colin took Fiorina from the twins and hugged her tightly.

Fiorina was just confused, saying "Huh? What?" as she looked around.

After confirming everyone's relieved expressions and letting out a deep sigh of relief, Suzy turned her sharp gaze to the north.

<b>

"What’s wrong?! Su!"

<b>

Beatrice noticed Suzy's gaze and asked.

<b>

"There are still about 20 or 30 coming this way, one after another."

"Eh?!"

<b>

At those words, not just Beatrice but all the children present were taken aback.

The new stone wall that Beatrice had deployed was strong, and the shadow dogs were struggling to break through.

Even so, some were still jumping over.

Dana and Lombard were still dealing with them.

From the sky, Mary was shooting down bats, and the two magic users were also taking them out.

<b>

"But with everyone now, they’re just weaklings, so it’s fine. The enchantment will last for another hour, so there’s no problem. Moreover..."

<b>

Suzy raised her right hand above her head and snapped her fingers.

<b>

"Come forth! World Tree!!"

<b>

From above, a massive seed-like object rapidly descended and pierced the ground.

It immediately opened up like peeling skin, revealing a trunk that sprouted branches, quickly becoming a young tree.

<b>

≪Summon Yggdrasil≫

A skill of the Great Wise Man.

Summoning a young tree of the World Tree grants the breath of life to those under its shade.

<b>

"If you're at the base of this tree, even if you're injured, you'll heal quickly, and your magic power will recover."

"Eh?! What? What is this? What is this? Su-chan!"

<b>

Mia's eyes widened, and she rushed over to Suzy with excitement.

<b>

"I summoned a young tree of the ash tree. This one will stay for about an hour, so it's fine, okay?"

<b>

Suzy answered nonchalantly.

S-summoning magic in such an instant? Beatrice's eyes rolled back, and her mouth dropped open in shock.

<b>

"So, everyone, just hold on a little longer."

"Are you planning to do something?!"

<b>

After regaining her composure, Beatrice asked Suzy.

<b>

"Yeah, since it’s endless, I’m going to cut off the source."

<b>

Suzy tilted her chin and glared into the depths of the forest that could not be seen from here.

<b>

"Will, Lombard, Bernap, protect everyone."

"Dana, Irvin, Alan, take them down."

"Mia, Karl, Mary, shoot the enemies."

"Willy, Colin, Vivi, please take care of everyone."

<b>

Suzy called out to each of them.

<b>

"Su-nee! I can fight too!"

"Yeah, Stefan can do it. Together with Helena, okay?"

"Leave it to me, big sister! I’ll protect everyone!"

"Okay, Helena, please."

<b>

Suzy patted Stefan's head and smiled at Helena.

"I'll protect you! Just watch me!" Stefan declared confidently, while Helena puffed her chest out proudly.

"We can fight too!" Clark and Ashton chimed in.

"Then you two go this way," Lombard said, pulling the twins along.

<b>

"Su-chan!!"

"Mupugyu!"

<b>

Mia hugged Suzy tightly.

<b>

"Thank you, thank you! Su-chan!"

"No, Mia, that must have hurt, right? I'm sorry for being late."

"I'm fine! I'm fine! But Su-chan... are you going to be okay alone?"

"Yeah, I'll be fine. So Mia, wait here with everyone, okay?"

Suzy placed her hand on Mia's waist and gently spoke while looking into her eyes.

<b>

"Su, thank you. Can you really go alone?"

"Yeah, Colin will be fine. So Colin, please take care of everyone."

"Then I’ll leave it to you! You’ll finish quickly, right?!"

"Yeah! Leave it to me, Vivi. I’ll finish it in less than 30 minutes, okay?"

"Count on you, Su! I’m leaving it to you!!"

"Yeah! Dana! I’m counting on you!!"

<b>

Dana raised her right fist and shouted, and Suzy responded by raising her own right fist.

<b>

"Okay, I’m off, everyone. I’ll be back soon, okay?"

"Go get 'em, Su! And take them down quickly!!"

<b>

Suzy nodded with a big smile at Beatrice's words.

With that, she kicked off the ground and ran towards the northern forest.

At that moment, a shadow dog jumped out from atop the stone wall in front of her.

Suzy slashed it as she passed by, increasing her speed as she ran into the forest.

The children watching let out gasps of admiration.

<b>

"Alright! Everyone! If Su returns and these guys aren’t taken care of, we won’t be able to face her!"

<b>

Beatrice shouted at everyone.

"Ooh!!" The children's battle cry echoed, shaking the ground around them.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suzy ran straight towards the multiple targets of extermination in the forest.

Along the way, she crushed every dog and bat that caught her eye.

<b>

(First, the ones giving orders to these guys. Evil Werewolves and Evil Bats. They even have the word "Evil" attached to their heads! It's so obvious! These guys are definitely the ones giving commands to the dogs and bats, unifying their will. If I take them down, they’ll just be a rabble. And the most troublesome one is this "Evil Wrat." This one is dangerous! But first, let’s quickly take down the dogs and bats!!)

<b>

She heard a "kikikyu" sound from her shoulder.

<b>

"Algernon, are you okay? Aren't you supposed to be by Vivi's side?"

<b>

"Kikikikyu!" No problem! chirped the rodent.

<b>

"Then, it’s dangerous to stay outside, so come in here, okay?"

<b>

As she opened her chest with her fingers, the rodent chirped and burrowed into her chest.

<b>

"Oh! N-no... d-don't... move... too much, okay?"

<b>

"Kikyu?" the rodent chirped. Even in such a moment, Suzy's cheeks were slightly flushed. As expected of her.

<b>

Suzy charged into the forest.

As she approached her target, the number of shadow dogs increased, but it didn't matter. She sliced through them all and pressed on.

Blood and flesh were scattered throughout the forest, but Suzy skillfully avoided the splatter, and not a single stain marred her attire.

Then, she spotted her target.

<b>

(I found it! Evil Werewolf!!)

<b>

Standing on two legs, it reached a height of two meters, a black wolf.

Before it could even recognize Suzy, it was easily slashed and turned into blood and flesh as it passed by her.

Suzy spun gracefully on the spot, coming to a stop.

At the same time, all the surviving shadow dogs around her turned into blood and flesh and scattered.

Suzy then looked up at the western sky.

In her line of sight were the bats swarming above.

Among them, she could see one particularly large individual.

<b>

(I've confirmed the Evil Bat! Should I blow them all away at once? ...It’s in the sky, so it should be fine, right?)

<b>

Suzy aimed her sword at the target and unleashed a skill.

<b>

≪Impact Storm≫

A long-range area attack skill of the Duel Barbarian.

<b>

With a low explosion sound, the target bat, along with the surrounding bats, was blown away.

In the space where the skill detonated, only black dust could be seen swirling.

And one more thing.

A target floating a little further away caught Suzy's attention, and she carefully concentrated her "Qi," aiming at it.

<b>

"Explode, okay...?"

<b>

With her "Qi" finely tuned to the limit, she released it towards the target.

The target was blown apart from the waist down, spiraling downwards towards the ground.

Satisfied with the result, she let out a "yes!" and exhaled through her nose.

She felt pleased with her exquisite control over her "Qi."

<b>

Now, it was time to focus on the most important target! Just as she was about to move from that spot, she noticed multiple presences approaching her.

<b>

(This is... the Shadow Ghouls I blew away at the school earlier? They are coming straight for me? There are quite a few... Huh? Are there Elder Vampires too? Are these the ones that were at the school? Four of them in total... Seriously! This isn't the time to be dealing with these guys!!)

<b>

Hmph! she thought, placing her hands on her hips and exhaling through her nose.

With a swift motion, she swung her sword, scattering the approaching Shadow Ghouls with a shockwave infused with her "Qi."

She then aimed her sword energy at the approaching vampires.

One, two, three. She shot them down in succession.

The last one was close enough, so she dashed in and swung her sword, scattering it as well.

<b>

"Alright, that’s done! Seriously, I wasted too much time!"

<b>

Suzy immediately started running towards the location of her final targets.

And it became clear quickly.

<b>

As she got closer, a rustling sound echoed around her, like a massive choir.

The overwhelming stench of beasts filled the forest.

It was not just staining the ground black; a black wave was overlapping and pulsating, spilling over and rising, forming a massive, writhing black mass.

And within that mass were countless red glowing lights.

<b>

Mad Lemmings.

About 30 centimeters in length. Bigger than Algernon by a size or two.

With pitch-black fur and crazed, burning red eyes. Their fangs are long and sharp. They could easily tear through children's leather armor.

The number was approximately twelve thousand.

They were waiting here, writhing, ready to avalanche into the village at any moment.

And the one giving the orders was...

<b>

(You! Evil Wrat!!!)

<b>
