# Chapter 164: Eastern Canal Highway

Currently, we are traveling east from Dekkenbel on a road called the "Eastern Canal Highway," riding in a large carriage.

Our destination is the central city of Karnaflemel County, "Lienkanal City."

<b>

Unlike the major highway that runs north and south through Karais State, this road extending east and west from Dekkenbel is not as well-maintained as the major highway.

The major highway itself also has sections that cut through wilderness and large forests, and not all of it is well-maintained.

<b>

This eastern road is only paved with basalt for about 2 kilometers from Dekkenbel at most.

Still, since it is used for distribution, the road is sufficiently packed down, and there are no inconveniences for the passage of carriages.

<b>

A dimly lit path cut through a deep forest lined with giant trees. A mountain road that crosses steep slopes multiple times. A winding valley squeezed between steep rock faces.

<b>

Because it is a road cut through uneven terrain, Roderick informed me that it requires more funds and effort to maintain than one might imagine.

However, it is not uncommon for bandits and brigands to appear in such harsh areas.

<b>

If it’s just a few hungry individuals, they will back off if you hand them a small amount of food or money, but it doesn’t work that way with a poorly organized gang of robbers.

If targeted by a large organized band of thieves, the only way to survive is to abandon the cargo and make a quick escape.

To avoid being targeted by thieves, it is said that traveling in large caravans with multiple carriages is a safety measure when passing through several dangerous points along this road.

<b>

Yet here we are, with only one large carriage.

Is this really okay, Roderick?

"Since Her Highness is with us this time, I feel like I'm on a large ship!" Roderick exclaimed with a hearty laugh.

Hmm, while I appreciate the trust, it does make me a bit uneasy...

<b>

<b>

Yes, this carriage journey is our first job as bodyguards, under the title of "VIP Protection."

Moreover, the client is none other than Roderick McGavin, the president of the Northmilia Trading Company!

<b>

After completing our registration at the Bouncer Association's office, we were immediately guided to the guest room at the back of the office, where I was to reunite with Roderick.

<b>

"It is an honor to be able to take on Her Highness Suzy's first job! This joy is beyond words!"

<b>

Roderick declared right off the bat, shaking my hand up and down repeatedly.

<b>

"Your Highness! I humbly ask for your guidance this time!"

"Roderick, perhaps you could calm down a bit..."

"Ah! Indeed, you are right! This is no place for such excitement!"

<b>

Roderick's motivation was incredibly high as he laughed heartily, shaking his large body.

Well, I’m also glad that my first job partner is someone I know, so I’m not too nervous.

<b>

<b>

The job involves protecting Roderick McGavin as he heads to a business meeting.

It is a two-night, three-day escort journey to and from Lienkanal, the central city of Karnaflemel County, which is adjacent to Nasanturka County where Dekkenbel is located.

<b>

Although it is a weekday job, I am exempt from school classes under the pretext of "off-campus training."

Well, once I return to the academy, I will have to make up for the classes I missed...

<b>

The plan is to return to Dekkenbel before noon on the weekend.

I should be just in time for Annie's birthday party.

<b>

If by any chance I were to miss it, it would be no laughing matter, so I intend to give my all to this job!

<b>

"Make sure you don't overexert yourself and mess things up!"

<b>

With a huff, I exhaled, and Vivi warned me.

I know, I know. I understand the importance of moderation!

Yet Vivi continued to give me a pointed look. What’s that about?!

<b>

Currently, Vivi is sitting in the driver's seat of the large carriage we are riding in, holding the reins alongside Mia.

The six bodyguards, excluding our client Roderick, are taking turns driving.

<b>

The carriage is a large one owned by Roderick, marked with the Northmilia Trading Company emblem.

It is about 5 meters long, roughly the size of a van.

Naturally, it is equipped with "spatial expansion" features, so the interior is spacious!

As expected for the personal vehicle of a major trading company president, the interior is luxurious, almost like riding in a high-end limousine! Though I’ve never been in one!!

<b>

"However! This carriage is impressive, but the horse pulling it is something else entirely!"

<b>

The one who spoke up was Rudori, a half-giant I met at the Bouncer Association.

<b>

"This clay golem horse has a different kind of power compared to others. But it’s still in the testing phase, right?"

"Yes, but I believe it is a truly wonderful horse."

<b>

The ones who continued speaking were two women with long golden hair reaching their waists and, of course, long ears. They are the two sun elves from Rudori's team.

<b>

<b>

When they refer to "horse," they mean the clay golem pulling this carriage.

<b>

In this world, perhaps due to the absence of internal combustion engines, the technology for clay golems has developed significantly.

Even the "pigeons" used for communication are one example. By the way, there are also small clay golems like "donkeys" and "cows," and even large magical beast models like hippos or elephants.

<b>

Clay golems larger than "horses" are relatively expensive, so not everyone can easily own them, but there are quite a few wealthy individuals and former nobles who use them.

<b>

Not needing to eat, possessing great power, and never tiring, clay golems are extremely useful for long-distance travel.

All that is needed is the magical power provided by the driver.

Thus, it is inevitable that the driver must be someone capable of handling magical power.

<b>

<b>

As for the two sun elves and Rudori's team...

It turns out that Roderick's protection was originally planned to be with Rudori's team from the start.

Originally, Rudori was just passing time at a pub to meet us.

However, he laughed, saying he never expected to see someone incapacitate a man so easily right after entering through the back door of the pub.

Normally, after the introductions, we would have had a light spar to confirm our abilities, but that was skipped, and while we were registering, Rudori told us this while chuckling.

<b>

The two sun elves sitting next to Rudori are named Namiena Falma and Sareina Roxanne.

<b>

Namiena is a striking beauty with sharp eyes and a straightforward demeanor. She wears armor and holds the advanced class of "Sword Knight."

Sareina, on the other hand, has a gentle, refined demeanor. She also holds an advanced class, being a "Saint," a healing class that ranks above Vivi and Colin.

<b>

Both appear to be around 17 to 18 years old, but as long-lived elves, their actual ages are not limited to that...

<b>

And the team leader, Rudori Sauza.

Rudori also holds an advanced class, the "Iron Knuckle," which communicates through fists, just like Alicia.

The steel gauntlets equipped on his hands emit a dull, cold light.

<b>

Rudori's team consists of Namiena drawing the enemy's attention with her shield, Sareina handling debuffs and healing, and Rudori delivering powerful punches, making for a well-balanced party.

<b>

The three of them quickly dealt with a magical beast that appeared along the way.

<b>

The magical beast they dealt with was a large boar-like creature called a "Fang Boar," about 3 meters long.

This creature is said to have become a magical beast due to living for a long time with dense magical power, known as a "magical power formation product."

The Fang Boar wandered out of the forest and unexpectedly attacked the carriage in surprise.

<b>

Sareina slowed its legs with magic as it charged, Namiena restrained it with her shield, and when it stopped, Rudori delivered a heavy punch to its temple to finish it off.

It was a seamless collaboration.

I was genuinely impressed to see that there are people who can handle magical beasts well, even outside of Amukam.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Although the Fang Boar was a magical beast, it was not as tainted by miasma as the magical beasts in Amukam.

With a little "magic extraction," it could be turned into sufficient food.

<b>

Having not hunted in a while, I felt a bit excited and asked Roderick and Rudori if I could dismantle it, to which they readily agreed, so I quickly hung it from a nearby tree and performed the magic extraction and dismantling.

<b>

Sareina and Namiena watched in wide-eyed amazement as I performed the magic extraction.

I wondered if "magic extraction" was rare, but they said, "I've never seen anyone extract miasma so cleanly."

I used to do this kind of thing often in Amukam.

<b>

Roderick and Rudori seemed surprised by the speed at which I dismantled it.

Well, I’ve been trained by Sonia Mama in this regard... But why is Mia showing off there?

<b>

The meat I dismantled would taste better after being aged for about a week, so I decided to take it with me. Once we reach the city, I could sell it somewhere.

However, I suggested that we should eat the fresh internal organs while they are still good, right here.

<b>

With everyone's agreement, I salted and grilled some heart and other parts by the side of the carriage.

To my delight, this was a huge hit with Roderick and the others!

<b>

"I had no idea that magical beast meat could be this delicious!"

"Isn't this packed with rich magical power?!"

"The umami of the meat dances on my tongue along with the refined magical power!"

<b>

I feel like I’m receiving some kind of gourmet praise that I don’t quite understand. No, I really don’t get it.

<b>

But unexpectedly, we were able to enjoy such a hormone party break. All thanks to the Fang Boar.

<b>

<b>

After traveling about 50 kilometers east from Dekkenbel on this road, we will cross the county border into Karnaflemel County.

About 20 kilometers further from there is a town called Hexagom, which serves as a midpoint.

This town exists at the center where the road branches north and south, and it is said to be the terminal city of eastern Karais State.

<b>

As a town where logistics flow, Hexagom attracts many people.

When people gather, it is only natural that unsavory characters will also gather.

While Dekkenbel has its fair share of unsavory individuals due to its population, the power balance behind the scenes keeps some order.

Hearing that, I realized that the older sisters must be working there.

<b>

However, Rudori informed us that Hexagom is quite lawless, as there are hardly any groups managing the area.

<b>

"There have been reports of large-scale bandit groups establishing bases here in recent years."

<b>

I see. It seems like it could become a feeding ground for them.

Well, as long as the targets we’re aiming for take the bait, that’s fine by me.

Even if we catch some scoundrels, it would be a form of cleanup, but since we don’t have much time, I guess I’ll be relying on Roderick.

<b>

Despite hearing such ominous words, we are enjoying this carriage journey as it heads straight towards our destination.
