# 164 East Canal Street

Currently, we are riding on a large horse-drawn wagon on a road called the "East Canal Road" that extends eastward from Dekenberu.

The destination is "Lien Canal City," the central city of Carnafraemer County.

<blank>

Unlike the main road that runs north-south through the province of Calais, this road, which runs east-west from De Kembel, is not as well developed as the main road.

The main road itself is not all that well maintained, as it runs through wilderness and large forests in some places.

<blank>

This eastern road has been paved with basalt or otherwise only up to 2 km from Dekenbel at best.

Even so, the road is well trodden, as it is used for distribution, and there are no obstacles to the passage of horse-drawn vehicles.

<blank>

A dimly lit road cut through a deep forest lined with giant trees. A mountain path that crosses steep slopes over and over again. The winding canyon between sheer rock faces.

<blank>

Roderick told us that it takes more money and labor than we imagined to maintain all of the roads, as they were cut out of a not-so-flat area.

But it is not unusual for bandits and bandit gangs to spring up in such a harsh place.

<blank>

If they are only food packers, they will back off if you give them a little food or a small amount of money, but this is not the case with a gang of poor quality robbers.

If you are targeted by a large, well-organized bandit group, the only way to save your life is to leave your cargo behind and make a run for it.

In order to avoid being targeted by bandits, it is said that a safeguard against passing through several dangerous points on the road is to form a large caravan with several wagons and proceed on a scale that would be too large for the bandits to handle.

<blank>

And yet now we are only one of the big carriages.

Are you all right? Mr. Roderick.

This time, the princess is with me, so I feel like I'm on a big boat!"

Mr. Roderick laughs high and low.

Well, we are glad that you trust us. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, this carriage trip was the first job we were given after becoming bouncers, and it was called "guarding VIPs.

Moreover, the client was Mr. Roderick McGovern, the chairman of the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce, himself!

<blank>

After registering at the bouncer association office, I was taken directly to the guest room at the back of the office because I had already received a request, where I was to meet Roderick again.

<blank>

I am honored to receive Princess Susie's first job! This joy is beyond description!"

<blank>

Roderick said this as soon as he opened his mouth and moved my hand, which he held in his, up and down again and again.

<blank>

Princess! Please accept my best regards!"

Mr. Roderick. You might want to calm down a little more ......"

Ha! Indeed it is! We must remain calm here!"

<blank>

Roderick's motivation was high as he shook his body and smiled broadly.

I am also happy that I am not nervous because I know the person I am working with for the first time.

<blank>

<blank>

The job is to guard Mr. Roderick McGovern on his way to a business meeting.

It's a three-day, two-night escort trip to and from Lien Canal, the central city of Carnafraemer County, next door to Nasantorca County, where De Kembel is located.

<blank>

The work is done on weekdays, but school classes are exempted as "off-campus training".

Well, when I return to the academy, I will have to take make-up classes for the ones I missed. ......

<blank>

Return to De Kembel is scheduled for the weekend before noon.

We expect to make it to Annie's birthday party just in time.

<blank>

We are determined to do our best to get the job done, because it would be unfortunate if we make a mistake and miss the deadline!

<blank>

You better make sure you don't put too much effort into this!"

<blank>

Hnsu," I exhale! I exhale and Bibi nails it.

Yes, I know that. I also know how to be moderate!

But Bibi throws further jitters at me. Why?

<blank>

Bibi is now sitting in the driver's seat of the large carriage that Mia and I ride in, and he is holding the reins of the carriage.

Each of the six guards, except for Roderick, the client, takes turns serving as the gyojin.

<blank>

The carriage is a large carriage with the crest of the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce, owned by Roderick.

It's about 5 meters long, so about the size of a wagon.

Naturally, it is a "space expansion" specification, so it is spacious and comfortable inside!

The interior is luxurious, as if it were a luxury limousine, as if it were the exclusive car of the chairman of a big business association! I've never been in one, though!

<blank>

But," he said, "this carriage is great, but the horse that pulls it is also unbelievable! This carriage is great, but the horse that pulls it is also extraordinary!"

<blank>

That's how Ludri, a half-giant I met at the Bouncer Association, calls to me.

<blank>

This Clay Golem horse has a little more horsepower than the others. But it's still a test run, right?"

Yes, but I still think it's a very nice horse.

<blank>

The two women who continued to speak were two women with long blond hair that reached their waists and also long ears. They are two of the Sun Elves on the same team as Mr. Rudri.

<blank>

<blank>

The "horse" that you two are referring to here is the clay golem that pulls this carriage.

<blank>

In fact, in this world, clay golem technology has developed anyway, perhaps as a substitute for the lack of internal combustion engines.

Pigeons" used for communication are one such example. There are also small "donkeys" and "oxen" that carry cargo, and even clay golems modeled after large magical beasts such as hippos and elephants. There are even clay golems modeled after large magical beasts such as hippopotamuses and elephants.

<blank>

A clay golem larger than an "Uma" is expensive, so not everyone can easily afford one.

<blank>

The clay golem, which does not feed, has great horsepower, and is tireless, is very useful when traveling long distances.

All that is needed is the magic power that the Guru gives.

Therefore, inevitably, the guru is the one who can handle magic power.

<blank>

<blank>

And about the two Sun Elves and Rudri's team here: .......

In fact, Roderick's escort was supposed to be with this Rudri's team from the beginning.

<blank>

I heard that Mr. Rudri had originally spent some time at the pub to meet us.

But they laughed at me, saying they didn't expect me to incapacitate a man so easily as soon as he came in through the back door, the pub.

While we were accepting the application, Rudri-san told us, laughing, that he had saved us the trouble of having a light handshake after the meeting to check our abilities.

<blank>

The two Sun Elves who are now sitting alongside Mr. Rudri are said to be Namiena Farma and Sareina Roxane.

<blank>

Namiena is a beautiful woman with clear eyes and an honest atmosphere. She wears armor and is a "Sword Knight," a high-ranking position.

Ms. Sareina is the opposite, a gentle and kind young lady. This is also an advanced level job, a recovery job called "saint. This is a class above Bibi and Korin.

<blank>

You both look about 17-8 years old, but you are long-lived elves, so your actual age is not limited to that. ......

<blank>

And the leader of the team, Rudri Souza.

Mr. Rudri is another advanced worker, an "iron knuckle" who speaks with the same fists as Alicia.

The steel gauntlets equipped in his hands are clad in a dull, cold light.

<blank>

Rudri's team is truly a well-balanced party, with Namiena using her shield to attract opponents, Sareena taking care of debuffing and recovery, and Rudri beating them down with her fists.

<blank>

The three of them dealt with the demonic beasts that quickly appeared along the way without any danger.

<blank>

This time, the three of them dealt with a large, three-meter-long boar-like magical beast called a "fang boa.

It is said that this is what is called a "magical formation product" that has become a magical beast after living for a long time together with rich magical power.

Fangboa, who had wandered out of the forest, came across this carriage and was surprised and attacked. It was like that.

<blank>

As the fangborers rushed in, Sareena slowed them down with magic, Namiena held them back with her shield, and when they stopped, Rudri finished them off with a heavy fist strike to the side of the head.

It was truly a flowing collaboration.

I was honestly impressed by the fact that there are people other than AMCAM who are able to skillfully deal with demonic beasts.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Even though the fang boa we killed was a magical beast, it was not as miasma-infested as the magical beasts of the Amkamu Forest.

It can also be a sufficient ingredient if you give it a bit of "magic removal.

<blank>

I asked Roderick and Rudri if I could dismantle it, and they readily agreed, so I hung it from a nearby tree and quickly removed the demon and dismantled it.

<blank>

Sareyna and Namiena's eyes widened when they saw me doing the demon extraction.

Was it unusual to 'remove the demon'? I thought so, but he said, "I have never seen such a clean removal of the miasma.

We used to do this kind of thing a lot in Amcam.

<blank>

Roderick and Rudri were amazed at the speed with which I dismantled them.

Yes, this much is in the works for Sonia-mama, so ....... I mean, why is Mia so smug there?

<blank>

I decided to take the meat with me because it tastes better after about a week's rest. I could sell it somewhere when I arrived in town.

But why don't you eat the fresh and tasty offal right then and there? I suggest.

<blank>

With everyone's consent, I grilled some hearts with salt next to the wagon.

This was a big hit with Roderick and the others!

<blank>

I didn't know that hexenbiest meat could be so tasty!"

This must be thickly imbued with magic!"

The meat tastes great, but at the same time the refined magic is dancing on your tongue!"

<blank>

I feel like I'm getting some kind of gourmet object praise that I don't really understand. No, I really don't understand.

<blank>

But unexpectedly, we got such a hormone party break. Thank goodness for Fangboa.

<blank>

<blank>

If you continue on this road about 50 kilometers east of De Kembel, you will cross the county border with Carnafraemer County.

About 20 kilometers further on is the town of Hexagom, which is also the midway point.

This city exists in the center of where the city road branches off to the north and south, and it is the terminal city of the eastern part of the state of Calais.

<blank>

Hexagom is a logistics hub that also attracts many people.

When people gather, as they should, so do the unscrupulous.

De Kembel also has a good number of people with a certain amount of shins because of the number of people, but there is still a balance of power behind the scenes in the city, so there is still order.

When I heard that, I came to the conclusion that, I see, the Misses are doing their job.

<blank>

However, Rudri told us that this town of Hexagom is quite a lawless area, as there are few people in charge of the area.

<blank>

There have been reports of large bandit bases being set up over the years.

<blank>

I see. I wonder if this will be a crowd-pleaser?

Well, as far as we're concerned, it's all right as long as the target bites.

If we catch an outlier, that would be a good way to clean up, but we don't have much time this time, so I guess I'm hoping Roderick will be able to do it.

<blank>

Despite the disturbing words we were hearing, we were enjoying our carriage ride to the fullest, and the carriage was on its way to its destination.
