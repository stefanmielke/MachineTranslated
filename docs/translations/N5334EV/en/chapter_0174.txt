# Chapter 162: Bouncer

From all around, rude and scrutinizing gazes are being cast.

This is clearly a rundown tavern, as if to say it all.

I know that it is not a place suited for someone like me.

After all, this is not a place where such a delicate maiden would come.

<b>

However, right now, I am not dressed in a cute outfit like a school uniform or a dress.

I am clad in light leather gear for exploring the forest.

In other words, this is our combat outfit, so I shouldn't stand out in a place like this!

Even so! When such beautiful girls walk together, it is only natural that they attract attention.

<b>

After all, everyone around here, whether I look to the right or left, is nothing but rough-looking brutes!

Huh? Are there women here too? …There are a few women, right?

<b>

Is it really okay for women to be in such a coarse place?

It actually smells here!

The stench of alcohol and men is overwhelmingly suffocating.

<b>

If beautiful girls are walking around while exuding a nice fragrance, it’s no wonder they catch people's eyes!

<b>

"Hey, are you sure you’re in the right place? This isn't somewhere for young ladies like you."

<b>

A man leaning on a round standing table as we pass by grins and speaks to us.

<b>

"I'm not saying anything bad. If you come over here and keep me company, I'll show you a good time."

<b>

Oh! Here comes the cliché line!

The Adventurers' Guild was different from what I imagined, so I never got to encounter it, but here it is!

Oh dear, this is quite the predicament!

<b>

"Why do you look so happy?!"

"Eh? I'm not, am I?"

"Seriously, you have such an excited face?"

"I-I don't think that's true, though?"

<b>

Ugh! Is my face smiling on its own?!

No, no! I need to stay cool!

I am a cool beauty!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

So, why are we at this rundown tavern, you ask…?

Let’s go back to yesterday, to the afternoon of the weekend.

After quickly finishing the fitting for the dress, we headed to the Adventurers' Guild where Kuu Emel was waiting.

There, she gave a brief explanation about the specialized department, "Bodyguard."

<b>

"The 'Bodyguard Association' is an organization that undertakes the protection of targets and the elimination of dangerous creatures."

<b>

Could it be that this refers to the work that the Amukamu team undertakes outside of Amukamu?

I see?

<b>

"When the Amukamu team operates outside of Amukamu, they need to take on jobs from the Bouncer Association through this Adventurers' Guild!"

<b>

Bibi adds this as a supplementary explanation.

It seems that this was an agreement made long ago between Amukamu and the country.

<b>

Speaking of which, I remember Howard Papa occasionally mentioning the term "agreement with the country."

I had never heard the complicated details, but I had heard that Amukamu and the country have a mutually supportive relationship.

It seems to be a rule due to the uniqueness of Amukamu.

Howard Papa said, "Everything is for Amukamu, which lives in harmony with Iloshio."

<b>

But I didn't know about the Bouncer. They could have told me sooner!

<b>

"Because you looked like you understood all about the 'Adventurers' Guild' from the start!"

"Ugh... well, that’s..."

"You looked puzzled at times, but since you didn't ask anything, I thought it was okay? I was talking with Bibi about that, you know?"

"For now, I decided to let you swim until you asked something!"

"Ugh!!"

<b>

Was I being toyed with?!

Bibi and Mia both have smirks on their faces! Damn it!!

I feel embarrassed and frustrated, thinking it’s my fault for getting flustered just from the word Adventurers' Guild… Damn it!!

Is the trap of the Adventurers' Guild working subtly even here?! Ugh!!

<b>

Unaware of my inner turmoil, Kuu Emel continued to explain that in order to register with the Bouncer Association, we first needed to become D-rank general members who can take on jobs in the specialized department at the Adventurers' Guild.

That's why Bibi was urging us to rank up quickly.

<b>

Furthermore, Kuu Emel had even prepared the necessary documents for registration.

<b>

First, a certificate proving that we are D-rank.

A letter of introduction from the guild, stating that our identity is verified.

And we also need something to prove our identity.

Originally, it seems we would need to submit a citizen's certificate, but we can simply present our student handbook from Miria.

This student handbook from Miria Castle Eye Boarding School carries enough social credibility.

Come to think of it, registering at this Adventurers' Guild was also done just by presenting the student handbook.

<b>

"Now, please take these documents to the office of the other party. The entrance is at the front facing the street, and also..."

<b>

Kuu Emel handed us the compiled documents and pointed to the map she laid out on the counter, showing us the location of the Bouncer Association.

It seems the association is located in the civic district.

<b>

"I think there will be a simple physical ability test during the reception. Please come in light clothing on the day."

<b>

And so, with the date having changed to today, the three of us set out for the Bouncer Association.
