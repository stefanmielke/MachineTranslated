# 162 Episode 162 Bouncers.

From all over the place, people were giving me stares.

This is a bar in the middle of nowhere.

I know it doesn't look like such a place.

After all, this is not a place where such a pretty maiden would come with her.

<blank>

More importantly, they are not dressed in girlish attire right now, such as Milia uniforms and dresses.

They wear light leather gear when they go exploring in the forest.

They are our battle uniforms so to speak, so they shouldn't be floating around in a place like this!

And yet! If all these beautiful girls walk together, it may be inevitable that they will stand out.

<blank>

In any case, all around us, whether we looked to the right or left, were a bunch of sweltering bastards!

Hmm? Are there women in the group? ...... There are some women, aren't there?

<blank>

Are you sure you're okay with women being in such a crude place?

In fact, it smells like coco!

The smell of alcohol and the smell of the bastards was really disgusting.

<blank>

If there were beautiful girls walking around smelling good in the midst of all this, it would be bound to attract attention, wouldn't it?

<blank>

"Hey, are you sure you're in the right place? This ain't the place for you ladies, is it?"

<blank>

A man with his elbows on a round standing table as he passed by grinned and spoke to me.

<blank>

I'm not going to say anything bad. Come over here and play with me, and I'll give you a good show."

<blank>

Oops! Here we are at the temp dialogue!

The Adventurers' Guild was not what I imagined, so I never met them! So this is where I've come to!

Oh no, no, no, no, I'm in trouble!

<blank>

Why do you look so happy?

"What? I didn't, shhh?"

Really, you look so excited, don't you?"

"Well, I don't think so, do you?"

<blank>

Unyuu! Is your face grinning by itself?

No, no, no! Let's be cool, let's be cool!

I am a cool beauty!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, what brings us to this seedy bar: .......

The story goes back to a day ago, yesterday weekend afternoon.

After taking my dress measurements, I went to the Adventurers' Guild, where Cu Emel was waiting for me.

There, he gave a brief explanation of the specialized department, "Bouncer.

<blank>

The Bouncer Association is an organization that is contracted to protect and eliminate dangerous creatures.

<blank>

Could it be, by any chance, that you are referring to work that AMCAM's team is undertaking outside of AMCAM?

I see?

<blank>

"If a team from AmCam works outside of AmCam, they must contract work from the Bouncer Association through this Adventurers' Guild!"

<blank>

Bibi adds a supplementary explanation.

It is said that this is a covenant that was agreed upon between Amcam and the state a long time ago.

<blank>

Come to think of it, the term "covenant with the state" was mentioned by Papa Howard from time to time.

I had never heard of the intricacies, but I had heard that the government and AMCAM have a mutually supportive relationship.

He also said that it is a decision made because of the special nature of Amcam.

Papa Howard said, "Everything is for Amcam to live with Irosio.

<blank>

But I didn't know about the bouncer. You could have told me sooner!

<blank>

You looked like you knew about the Adventurers' Guild from the very beginning!

"Oh, ......, that's..."

I was talking to Bibi and asking her if it's okay that she didn't ask me anything. I was talking to Bibi, you know?"

For now, we decided to let him swim until he hears something!"

Coo!"

<blank>

Was it being toyed with, too?

Both Bibi and Mia are smooching their mouths off! Tsk tsk tsk!

I'm so frustrated and embarrassed to think that it was my fault for getting spilled on the word "Adventurers' Guild" in the first place. ...... Contikuso!

Does this mean that the Adventurers' Union's trap is working soberly even here? Kuh!

<blank>

Cu Emel, who had no idea of my inner agony, further explained to me that in order to register with the bouncer association, I first had to become a D-rank general member of the Adventurers' Guild, which allows me to work in a specialized department.

So Bibi was in a hurry to get up the ranks as soon as possible.

<blank>

Furthermore, Cu Emel even prepared the necessary documents for registration.

<blank>

First of all, a certification document showing that the applicant is D-ranked.

A letter of introduction from the union that says the identity is authentic.

And they need something to prove their status.

We were told that we only needed to present Milia's student handbook, although we were supposed to submit a list of our citizenship.

I'm told that this student handbook of the Milia Castel Eye boarding school has that much social credibility.

Come to think of it, I remember when I registered for this adventurers' union, all I had to do was show my student handbook.

<blank>

Please take these documents to their office. The entrance is here on the street, and also at ............"

<blank>

Cu Emel handed me the documents he had put together and showed me the location of the bouncer association, pointing to a map he had put out on the counter.

The association is apparently located in the civic district.

<blank>

When you arrive at the reception desk, you will be subject to a simple physical examination. Please dress lightly on the day of your visit.

<blank>

So today, after the date had changed, the three of us went out to the Bouncer Association.
