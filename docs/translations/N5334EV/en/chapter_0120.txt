# 108 Invitation to the Consulate

Just in time to jump in!

◇ ◇

<blank>

We have made a few minor additions and corrections.


----------------

<blank>

The Amcam Consulate is about 30 minutes by horse-drawn carriage from the school.

On this day, in addition to us freshmen, Colin and AnnaMarie came with us, so there were seven of us in total.

<blank>

When I arrived at the consulate, my uncle, aunt, and Annie greeted me immediately.

Annie had Colin with her, so she was very excited to have a sleepover with everyone.

Surrounded by a large number of customers, they looked happy from start to finish, which was very cute and appropriate for their age.

<blank>

The dinner that night was a meat-based meal, which was kindly prepared by my aunt, as all the guests were growing up.

The beef, pork, chicken and lamb roasts were all excellent! The enthusiasm and care of the head chef of the house came through perfectly!

Irving and Lombardo's boys were devouring the food, or at least drinking it. They were devouring the food with such gusto that I thought they were drinking it.

Bibi and Mia were also putting away the food quite as fast as the two of them.

However, I am reminded once again of how great she is, because even though she dares to be such a healthy daredevil, she is still a refined young lady in her dining manners.

I am not lagging behind everyone else, but I am enjoying the food as well!

I knew the people of Amkam were carnivorous to the core, I bet!

<blank>

<blank>

When I told her about Irving's duel over dinner, her uncle leaned forward with a 'ho-ho-ho,' her aunt laughed and said 'a la la la, oh well,' and Annie listened with a twinkle in her eye.

Furthermore, Bibi publicly announced that I had become the largest faction of first-year students!

Even when I pleaded with her to stop, Bibi's mouth would not stop, and even Mia and Irving and the others joined in to stir things up!

My uncles praised me, saying, "That's great! but I couldn't stop my face from burning.

And even more! If word got out that she was friends with Master Carrie as well, Annie would say, "Great! That's great!" and she shouts all over the place.

It seems that Carrie's fame is well-known among Annie and the other children in the elementary school. I knew it was Carrie-sama who was great, right?

<blank>

Well, that's how we talked about what was going on over dinner.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Sister?"

Oh, you mean Mrs. Colette of the Bear Trading Company."

You know about this?

Oh, the Bear Trading Company is one of the big trading companies that run the river port workers," she said. Colette is the wife of the president of the Bear Trading Company. She is a dashing woman who is capable of using a large number of men at her command.

"I see, you are a 'landlady' of sorts, aren't you?"

Well, is that about right?"

Colette hates being called 'landlady,' much less 'Mrs.,' with all her heart."

So you're a "big sister," huh?

<blank>

I'm in trouble, ha ha ha," my uncle chuckled cheerfully. I see. It seems that there are some people at Irving's place of business who are quite strong characters.

It is said that once, in front of Irving and his friends, a large group of laborers had a slight misunderstanding and almost got into a big fight. However, the men were so shocked that they dropped their fists in the air. ......

<blank>

It was intimidating. That was as much pressure as Aria."

<blank>

Irving says so, and Lombardo nods his head in agreement. That's great "Sister" .......

<blank>

According to what I heard, when Irving and his colleagues first went to work at this Collette sister's place, they got tangled up with some senior workers at the stuffing station there. ......

Because he was wearing the uniform of the school, he was told "Oi oi oi, this is not a place for a monk," or "You can't do anything here with such thin arms," and he was laughed at.

Well, no one would look at Lombardo and say he has "slender arms," but Irving is a relatively small man, so he probably looked slender when he was standing alongside Lombardo.

<blank>

She looks like that, but she is surprisingly muscular. ......, says Bibi, but .......

How do you know all that? I don't dare to poke my nose into it, though! I feel like I'd lose if I did!

<blank>

Then, when I went to ask where the supervisor was, I heard that someone had stepped out into the aisle and tried to catch Irving's foot.

Irving said, "I kicked the guy's leg out of the way," he said.

As a matter of course, a brawl broke out afterwards, but Irving and his team, as a matter of course, overpowered the brawl.

<blank>

What the hell is this guy doing? Davis, you were with him, weren't you? What the hell are you doing, bringing other people into it, too?

<blank>

No. Danny's a real piece of work, isn't he? Danny's a real piece of work, isn't he?"

<blank>

He's so happy to see me that he's worried about me! Even Lombard is grumbling!

At the end of the fight, he says he and Mr. Davis were smiling and saying to each other, "You're good!" and they were knocking each other's fists. and then they smiled at each other and said, "You're good!" ...... Davis, you, too?

Yada, yada, yada, these fighting people. ......

Eventually, afterwards, I heard that even those rough people recognized me, opened up to me, and we became friends. ......, what are you doing, really!

And then, when "Sister Colette" hears that you've been fighting with these ruffians, she likes you for your courage and prowess, and loves you?

<blank>

What, what is that ironclad development? The promise that we couldn't meet at the Adventurers' Guild was hidden in the middle of nowhere? This is the strength of a man with heroic attributes, isn't it?

Oh my god! I'm kind of intensely jealous!

<blank>

<blank>

I'll visit Colette tomorrow for the first time in a long time. I'll visit Colette tomorrow for the first time in a long time, after having tea at Susie's before noon.

<blank>

As he said this, my uncle turned to me as if he was playing a trick on me and showed me one of his eyes meditating.

Ofu...... that means everyone is coming to the store tomorrow.

I'm kind of nervous!

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

After a sumptuous dinner, my uncle said he had a story to tell, so we all moved to a different room to hear it.

<blank>

I'm sorry it took me so long to tell you.

You mean the bandits we captured?

<blank>

After taking a sip of tea made by the house maid, my uncle slowly opened his mouth.

When Bibi responded to his uncle's words as if he had expected it, his uncle nodded his head and said, "Oh, yes.

<blank>

According to my uncle's story, those guys were some kind of street gang that had their roots in the slums of De Kembel.

My uncle said it took a long time to identify them because they were not affiliated with any large organization and were working in different groups.

In short, they were like a "semi-greater" group, right?

It sure looked badass, didn't it?

<blank>

"They were on their way back from taking a shipment to the city of Immedio, and that's when they got into this.

<blank>

What's with that "Let's go hunting a little while you're running an errand? What's with that "Let's go hunting a little while I'm running an errand" kind of attitude?

You say it's such a light motive?

They're seriously the worst of the worst!

<blank>

I was carrying a load of ...... "Have you ever heard of the name 'Backdoor'?"

"Is this Bakudoa ......?"

I'm guessing you're referring to the magic potion that's been circulating on ...... lately!"

Yes, you knew very well."

No, I only know the name , but I don't know much about it! I only know the name ......, I don't know the details!"

<blank>

That's great Bibi, and your uncle says, "It's a big deal just to know your name.

<blank>

As you know, legitimate magic potions are controlled by alchemists. However, such unauthorized products, which are not controlled by alchemists, are full of unknown side effects.

<blank>

Maybe an alchemist is treated like a "pharmacist" in the original world.

And, according to my uncle, this "backdoor" is a magic potion sold through black market channels that has rapidly become available in the last six months or so.

<blank>

Magic potions are, in short, things that intrude on my (enchanter's) work, such as "healing potions" that heal wounds and "magic potions" that restore some magic power, as well as things that temporarily increase attack power by boosting physical strength and stamina, or increase magic power by boosting magical power. I'm talking about those things that come into my (enchanter's) business! Hmmm..!

<blank>

The back door is said to increase the strength of the muscles and magic at the same time, and even those who have no magic power can use magic for a short period of time. However, the side effects are also quite severe, and there have already been a considerable number of victims.

<blank>

My uncle says that the number of victims in the last six months has already exceeded three figures. The victims ...... are those who lost their lives, that is to say.

<blank>

"Is such ...... a dangerous thing, huh?"

That's what they were dealing with?

That's what I'm talking about.

<blank>

I have a feeling that the conversation is getting a lot louder!

What kind of super development is it when you catch an extortionist and he turns out to be a drug trafficker?

They weren't just a bunch of thugs, though, were they?

<blank>

The interrogator recorded that they used a 'back door' themselves, so they didn't hesitate to commit the crimes. The interrogator recorded that they had no hesitation in committing the crimes.

<blank>

The drug Backdoor is said to elevate the user's state of mind and numb his or her sense of ethics.

Moreover, my uncle told me that it was a dangerous drug that was highly addictive and surely destructive to both the body and the mind.

No! It's definitely a bad drug, isn't it? Seriously, it's a bad idea to have such a drug on the market, isn't it?

<blank>

Then! They will be subjected to even harsher interrogations, followed by harsher punishments?

<blank>

Bibi asked his uncle about the future treatment of the guys.

Well, I guess Bibi is right, there will be more severe interrogation. Even though he was a courier, he was involved in such a dangerous drug, and I think the people who maintain public safety would want to pursue even the source of the drug.

In this world, they still interrogate criminals in a torturous manner, so I guess I'm sorry to hear that. Well, they got what they deserved.

<blank>

That's the thing. ......"

<blank>

My uncle, exhaling deeply, leaned his body against the back of the chair, wrinkled his brow deeply, and looked as if he was in some difficulty.

<blank>

Is there a problem?

It was three days before ....... After all of them had been interrogated. ............ all of them died of illness."

"...... yes?"

"Three days ago, in the early morning of the 11th day of the 5th lunar month, it was officially announced that 17 perpetrators, three prison guards, and two interrogators had died from illness. It was officially announced that 17 perpetrators, 3 jail guards, and 2 interrogators, a total of 22 people, had died of illness.

「「「「「 Huh?!!!」」」」」

<blank>

Nah! What? Hey, what the heck?

My uncle threw down the stack of papers he was carrying on the table and started rubbing his wrinkled brow.

<blank>

Disturbing! It's too disturbing! Uncle?

All the murderers, and even the guards for that matter, died of illness at the same time? That's impossible, isn't it? What? This stench of conspiracy!

<blank>

......Uncle dropped a huge bomb on us at the end of the day. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Geez, I'm not sure I'm ready for this! That's why you have a bruise, Reilly? That's not good, is it? Ha-ha-ha!

Shut up and shut up, Parker!"

"Lurie, did you just stand there and watch?"

I can't help it! There's no way I'm going to be among those people!"

"Wow, ......, the daughter of the mayor of Notos says some pretty sweet things, huh? Aha!"

Even Katia knows that no matter how old the nobility is, they can't challenge the still powerful dukes, can they?

<blank>

It was a weekend afternoon. In a corner of a downtown café terrace, four men and four women were sitting at a table facing the street, talking noisily without paying attention to their surroundings.

<blank>

One pair of men and women were wearing the uniforms of Milia Castel Eye, which is well-known to everyone in this town, but they looked somewhat out of place compared to the existing uniforms.

The other pair, a man and a woman, are wearing clothes from a school known for its moderate quality, but they are so disheveled that one can hardly recognize their original attire. The female student wears so much make-up that one would think she was in the nightlife business.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Oi, it's time to go."

"Hmm? Already? You can't even slow down!"

What, it's not even three o'clock yet?"

You're back early.

We had no choice, our curfew has been shortened. ......

Haha! Is that the pena that caused all the commotion?!"

"...... tch."

<blank>

I'm going back today, you guys! I'm going back to the store, you guys!

Wait a minute! We can't afford such a fancy restaurant!"

Yeah? Tsk! I can't help it. ......, that should be enough, right?"

Oi! Let's go!"

Oh, wait! Then it's because I asked you to!"

<blank>

See you later.

<blank>

The man and woman remaining at the table waved to them as they left, smiling frivolously.

<blank>

"Heh! He left three large silver coins in a heap."

"How dare you drop a 750c on me with impunity, ......!"

<blank>

The two men retracted their previous smiles as if they were lying and flicked their fingers at the large silver coin on the table with cold expressions.

A female student, called Katia, lazily put her cheek on the table, fiddled with a silver coin with the fingertip of one hand, and muttered, "Whatever," to the man.

<blank>

"...... Reilly, you know, you used to say big things about Zuibn, but ...... actually, what's the big deal?"

You said, "............ No, you're strong. I don't know about that Grouse Mill County thing, though. At least he was stronger than me, right?"

What?" Really? But he said it was a blow. ......"

The most popular and most popular of all the "elite" from all over the state of Calais are gathered here in Milia Castellai. It's no wonder there's a Bakemon or two in there.

Hah ......, well, I guess you're right."

<blank>

Katya let out a sigh of resignation, perhaps satisfied with the answer of the male student called Parker.

<blank>

I'm more interested in the question, "Did you pass last week's exam?"

'...... fell out! Darn! This is my third ...... in a row! Next time I'll carve a spiritual seal on it!"

'Well, why don't you just do your best and get it engraved by the time you graduate? After all, more than half of the people in the world can't even handle magic properly! The fact that you can use magic, albeit only a little, is enough to make you one foot on the side of the elite! Heh!

"...... but they already said they were going to carve the spirit seal the day after the entrance ceremony, right?"

...... yeah, you said it."

I'm like, "Screw it! I think!"

I'm telling you, they are genuine elitists! I told you they are genuine elitists! Well, I don't care. They drop money for us like this. I'm grateful for it!

I'm sure you're right. If you play it just right, the lady will give you a little money on her own!

I'll be right there! Just like that, just like that! Ha-ha-ha!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"What is it? You're talking about something that sounds pretty good, aren't you?

Ah! Fluke!

This is Fluke's brother. Heh, heh, heh. I've got a little something for you.

<blank>

Suddenly, a man approached the two on the café terrace from the street side.

The man, called Fluke, dropped his buttocks into the chair next to Katia's and hugged her shoulders, as he should have.

Katia sounded happy as she was hugged on the shoulder, and Parker laughed sneeringly and welcomed Fluke into his home.

<blank>

Fluke was a flamboyantly dressed man, wearing a shirt that was wide open at the chest and many ornaments.

Although the attire was far from elegant, the quality of the materials was of high quality, suggesting a good money-making ability.

However, in spite of the well-defined sweet mask, her eyes also carry a hint of darkness that is characteristic of people who do not live on the surface.

<blank>

What? If it's a good story, let me in on it. Right?

It's petty money that doesn't belong in Fluke! Hey! What's more! Do you have any time after this?

Time? Well, yeah, at ......? What's the payoff?"

I was just asked by a local junior colleague to go and check out the store.

Heh."

It's a tea house called The Big Vestibule. Do you know it?"

"Is that the place near Alfalfa Boulevard? That's another upscale place that doesn't suit you guys! You've got the wrong clientele!

Well, yes. ......

<blank>

Parker makes a sneer and explains to Fluke that he is going to show his face to the daughter of the lady's maid there.

<blank>

I'll just go and say hello to them.

<blank>

(Did someone ask you to go harass them? Not many idiots would mess with a store like that.

Well, it's not worth it. There's no good in getting involved in a bad situation. ...... They are free to get hurt on their own. ......)

<blank>

Well, not too much.

<blank>

Having lost interest from both of them, Fluke wiped the story clean from his mind.

<blank>

Well, I don't want to interrupt you two, so I'm going to go now."

Oh, God! I'm not in your way! If you're going away, I'm going with you!"

Sorry, I have to go to work now."

Is it you yourself at this hour, brother?"

<blank>

Fluke, who always leads a large number of prefects, questioned Parker as an exception.

<blank>

I've been shorthanded, so I've been out in the field doing my own thing."

That's ......, thanks for your help bro! If you ever need me, I'm always at your service!"

Oh! I'll be counting on you. I'll be counting on you."

<blank>

I'd welcome it if you could use it in moderation," Fluke says to himself, so that they don't hear him.

But he never even flinches from such a thought.

<blank>

Fluke turned his back to them, waved his hand affectionately at them, and pulled a note from his pocket. He then glanced down at it curiously and asked, "Rodrigo ......? What's the code for? What's that code?" He mumbled something like that and strode away from the place.
