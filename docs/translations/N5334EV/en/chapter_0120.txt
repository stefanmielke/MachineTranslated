# Chapter 108: Invitation to the Consulate

Just barely made itーーー(>ω<)

<b>

◇

<b>

I made a few additions and corrections.

----------------

<b>

The Amukam Consulate is about a 30-minute carriage ride from the academy.

On this day, besides us first-year students, Colin and Annemarie came along, making a total of seven visitors.

<b>

When we arrived at the consulate, my uncle, aunt, and Annie greeted us immediately.

Since Colin was with her, Annie was incredibly excited about the sleepover with everyone.

Surrounded by many guests, she looked genuinely happy and very cute for her age.

<b>

For dinner that day, since everyone was growing, my aunt had prepared a meat-centered meal.

The roast beef, pork, chicken, and kid goat were all exquisite! The enthusiasm and thoughtfulness of the mansion's head chef were perfectly conveyed!

The boys from Irvin and Lombard devoured the food as if they were drinking it.

Bibi and Mia were also clearing their plates with considerable vigor, not to be outdone.

However, despite Bibi's hearty appetite, her table manners were those of a refined young lady, which made me think she was quite impressive.

Well, I was also enjoying the meal without falling behind everyone!

It seems that the people of Amukam are truly carnivorous at heart!

<b>

<b>

While having dinner, when we talked about Irvin's duel, my uncle leaned in with interest, my aunt laughed, saying, "Oh my, oh my," and Annie listened with sparkling eyes.

Furthermore, Bibi publicly declared that I had become the largest faction among the first-year students!

Even when I pleaded with her to stop, Bibi wouldn't shut up, and to make matters worse, Mia and Irvin joined in to egg her on!

My uncle and aunt praised me, saying, "As expected!" and "That's amazing!" but I couldn't stop my face from burning.

Moreover, when it was mentioned that I had become friends with Lady Carrie, Annie exclaimed, "Amazing! Amazing!"

It seems that even among the elementary school kids, Lady Carrie's fame has spread. Truly, Lady Carrie is something else, isn't she?

<b>

Well, that's how we spent our time during dinner, catching up with each other.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Aniki?"

"Oh, you're talking about Madame Colette from the Bear Trading Company?"

"Do you know her?"

"Yes, the Bear Trading Company is one of the major trading companies that manages laborers working at the river port. Colette is the president's wife. She's a spirited woman who skillfully manages many men, even though she's a woman."

"I see, so she's like a 'landlady,' huh?"

"Well, something like that?"

"Colette absolutely hates being called 'landlady' or even 'madame.'"

"So that's why she's called 'Aniki.'"

<b>

"That's quite troublesome, huh? Hahaha," my uncle chuckled. I see. It seems that Irvin's workplace has quite a character.

I've heard that once, when a large group of laborers was about to get into a big fight over a minor misunderstanding in front of Irvin and the others, it was Colette's shout that made the men lower their raised fists...

<b>

"The intimidation she exuded was incredible. It was pressure on par with Aria."

<b>

Irvin's words made Lombard nod in agreement. Wow, 'Aniki' is something else...

<b>

According to what I've heard, when Irvin and the others first went to work for 'Aniki' Colette, they were teased by the senior workers at the office...

Since they were wearing academy uniforms, they were mocked with comments like, "Hey, this isn't a place for rich kids!" and "With those skinny arms, you can't do anything here."

Well, I doubt anyone would call Lombard 'skinny,' but since Irvin is relatively small, he might have looked delicate next to Lombard.

<b>

Despite appearances, he actually has quite a bit of muscle, but... Bibi said that...

Why do you know that?! I'm not going to comment on it! I feel like I would lose if I did!!

<b>

Then, when they tried to ask where the supervisor was at the office, someone stuck their foot out in the hallway to trip Irvin.

Irvin said he kicked that person's foot away, saying, "Get out of the way!"

Of course, it led to a brawl afterward, but Irvin and the others naturally managed to suppress it.

<b>

What on earth is this person doing?! Davis was supposed to be there too, right? What are you doing, dragging others into this mess?!

<b>

"No! Danny's a tough one too, you know?"

<b>

Ignoring my worries, he said it cheerfully! Lombard is nodding along too?!

After they knocked everyone down, Davis and Irvin exchanged smiles, saying, "Not bad!" while bumping fists... Davis, you too?!

I can't stand this fighting tribe...

In the end, it seems they were recognized by those rough guys, got along, and became friends...

What on earth are they doing?!

And then, hearing about how they dealt with those rough characters, 'Aniki' Colette took a liking to their courage and strength, and now they're being pampered by her?

<b>

What is this, some kind of cliché development?! The promise we couldn't meet at the Adventurers' Guild was hiding in a place like this?! Is this what it means to have a hero attribute, to have such luck?!!

Ugh! I'm feeling intensely jealous!!

<b>

<b>

"Tomorrow, I think I'll drop by Colette's place for the first time in a while. But only after having tea at Suzy's around noon."

<b>

As he said this, my uncle winked at me playfully.

Oh no... that means everyone is coming to the shop tomorrow.

I'm feeling so nervous!

<b>

◇

<b>

After enjoying a lavish dinner, my uncle said he had something to discuss, so we moved to another room to hear what everyone had to say.

<b>

"I'm sorry it took so long to report back."

"You're talking about the captured bandits, right?!"

<b>

After taking a sip of the tea poured by the mansion's maid, my uncle slowly began to speak.

In response to my uncle's words, Bibi replied as if she had expected it, and my uncle nodded vigorously, saying, "Yes, that's right."

<b>

According to my uncle, those people were a group of street gang members based in the slums of Dekembel.

They weren't affiliated with any large organization and operated in groups, which is why it took time to identify them, my uncle explained.

In other words, they were like 'semi-criminals'?

They certainly seemed to be quite troublesome.

<b>

"They committed this act while returning from delivering goods to Inmedio."

<b>

What kind of 'while running an errand, how about a little hunt?' vibe is that?!

Is that really such a light motive?!

They're truly the worst kind of people!

<b>

"The goods they were transporting... have you heard of something called 'Backdoor'?"

"Backdoor... you say?"

"Is it... the potion that's been circulating recently?!"

"That's right, you know your stuff."

"No! I only know the name... I don't know the details!"

<b>

Bibi is impressive; my uncle even remarked, "Just knowing the name is quite something."

<b>

"As you know, legitimate potions are managed by alchemists. However, with these non-licensed products, we have no idea what kind of side effects they might have."

<b>

It seems that alchemists are treated like 'pharmacists' in this world.

According to my uncle, this 'Backdoor' is a potion sold through dark channels that has rapidly started circulating in the last six months.

<b>

Potions are essentially things like 'healing potions' that heal wounds or 'magic potions' that restore some magical power, and they can temporarily boost physical strength or magical power, encroaching on my (enchanter's) work! Hmph!

<b>

"This 'Backdoor' is said to simultaneously enhance physical strength and magical power, allowing even those without magical power to use magic for a short time. However, the side effects are quite severe, and there have already been a significant number of casualties."

<b>

My uncle mentioned that the number of casualties in the last six months has already exceeded three digits. Casualties... meaning those who have lost their lives.

<b>

"That's... a dangerous thing, isn't it?"

"Are you saying they were handling that?!"

"That's what I'm saying."

<b>

It feels like the situation has escalated significantly!

So, after catching extortionists, they turned out to be drug dealers? What kind of crazy development is this?!!

So they weren't just some troublesome punks!

<b>

"It seems they were using 'Backdoor' themselves. Therefore, the interrogators noted that they likely had no hesitation in committing their crimes."

<b>

The drug 'Backdoor' is said to elevate the user's mental state and numb their sense of ethics.

Moreover, it has a high potential for addiction and definitely destroys both body and mind, my uncle stated.

No! This is definitely a dangerous drug, right?! It's really bad for such a drug to be circulating, right?!!

<b>

"Then! They will face even stricter interrogations and severe punishments afterward, right?!"

<b>

Bibi asked my uncle about the future treatment of those people.

Well, as Bibi said, there will likely be stricter interrogations. Even though they were just couriers, since they were involved with such dangerous drugs, those maintaining public order would want to trace it back to its source.

In this world, it seems they still conduct torture-like interrogations on criminals, so it's a pity for them. Well, they brought it upon themselves.

<b>

"About that..."

<b>

My uncle said this, then took a deep breath, leaned back in his chair, and furrowed his brow, looking quite troubled.

<b>

"Is there a problem?"

"...It was three days ago. After everyone had undergone the usual interrogations... it seems they all died of illness."

"...What?"

"On the early morning of '5th Blue Moon, 11th,' it was officially announced that all 22 individuals, including 17 perpetrators, 3 jailers, and 2 interrogators, had died of illness."

"「「「「「Huh?！！」」」」」

<b>

Wha... what?! 

My uncle spat this out, then threw the stack of documents he was holding onto the table and began to rub his furrowed brow.

<b>

This is ominous! It's too ominous, uncle?!!

All the criminals, and even the guards, died of illness at the same time?! That's impossible, right?! What is this conspiracy?!

<b>

...My uncle just dropped a huge bombshell at the end... ah.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Gahahaha! So that's how you got a bruise, Rayleigh?! Serves you right?! Gahahaha!"

"Shut up, Parker!"

"Rulii, were you just sitting there quietly too?"

"I couldn't help it! There's no way I could get in with those kinds of people!!"

"Oh? The mayor's daughter is saying something quite demure! Haha!"

"Even if I'm from an old noble family, I know I can't go against a powerful duke's family!"

<b>

On a weekend afternoon, four boys and girls were sitting at a table facing the street in a corner of a café terrace, chatting noisily without caring about the eyes around them.

<b>

One pair of boys and girls was wearing the uniform of the Miria Castle Eye, known to everyone in this town, but their outfits looked somewhat disheveled compared to the standard.

The other pair was wearing uniforms from a mid-tier academy, but theirs were so disheveled that the original style was unrecognizable. Furthermore, the female student was wearing heavy makeup, as if she were in the night business.

<b>

<b>

"…Hey, it's almost time."

"Huh? Already?! We barely had time to relax!"

"What? It's not even 3 o'clock yet?"

"You're coming back quite early."

"I can't help it; our curfew has been shortened..."

"Haha! Is it because of the commotion caused by Pena?!"

"…Tch."

<b>

"Since I have to go back now, you guys! I'm counting on you to take care of the shop!"

"Wait a minute! We can't afford to go into such a high-end shop with our allowance!"

"What?! Tch! Fine, will this be enough?"

"Hey! Let's go!"

"Ah, wait! I'm counting on you!"

<b>

"Alright, see you later!"

<b>

The remaining boys and girls waved goodbye with insincere smiles to the two who were leaving.

<b>

"Heh! They left three large silver coins just like that."

"750c without a care... how much is that?!"

<b>

The two retracted their smiles as if they were fake and looked at the large silver coins on the table with cold expressions.

The girl called Katia rested her cheek on the table lazily, playing with the coins with her fingertips, and said to the boy, "…Rayleigh, you used to talk big, but... are you actually not that great?"

"…No, he's strong. I don't know about being the best in Gruusmil County, but at least he was stronger than me."

"Really? Is that so? But it was just one hit..."

"Well, it's the Miria Castle Eye, where elites from all over Kalais gather. It wouldn't be surprising if there were one or two monsters among them."

"Ugh... well, I guess that's true."

<b>

In response to Parker's answer, Katia sighed in resignation, as if she had come to terms with it.

<b>

"By the way, did you pass last week's exam?"

"…I failed! Tch! That's three times in a row now! Next time, I'm definitely going to inscribe the spirit seal!"

"Hmph, well, as long as you manage to inscribe it before graduation, that's good, right? After all, more than half of the people in this world can't even handle magic properly! Just being able to use a little magic puts you well into the elite category!"

"…But they said that those guys inscribed their spirit seals the day after the entrance ceremony."

"…Yeah, they did say that."

"That's so frustrating!"

"That's why I'm saying! Those guys are pure elites! Well, it doesn't matter. They keep dropping pocket money like this for us. Let's gratefully accept it!"

"Hmph, that's right. If we just play along, the young lady will scatter her small change!"

"Exactly! Just play along, play along! Hihihihi!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What’s going on? You seem to be having a pretty good time over there?"

"Ah! Fluke!!"

"Hey, Fluke, what's up? Hehe, just a little something going on."

<b>

Suddenly, a man called Fluke approached the two at the café terrace from the street side.

Fluke casually dropped into the chair next to Katia, pulling her close.

Katia, being hugged, let out a happy voice, and Parker smiled obsequiously, welcoming Fluke.

<b>

Fluke was dressed in a flashy outfit with a wide-open shirt and many accessories.

His attire was far from elegant, but the quality of the materials hinted at good financial standing.

However, despite his well-groomed, handsome face, his eyes carried a certain darkness typical of someone who doesn't live in the light.

<b>

"What’s up? If it’s a delicious story, let me in on it. Okay?!"

"Fluke, this is just some small change! Hey! By the way, do you have time after this?!"

"Time? Well, let's see... so? What kind of money-making story is it?"

"Nothing much, just a request from a local junior to check out a shop."

"Really?"

"The tea house called 'The Big Front Yard.' You know it?"

"Oh, that's the shop near the Alfalfa Boulevard, right? That's a high-end shop that doesn’t suit you guys! The clientele is different, right?!"

"Well, that's true..."

<b>

Parker made a sycophantic smile and explained to Fluke that he was going to show his face to the waitress there.

<b>

"I'll just go and greet them."

<b>

(Did someone ask him to go and cause trouble? There aren't many fools who would try to mess with shops in that area.

Well, it probably wouldn't be worth it. Getting involved would yield no benefits... but it's their freedom to get hurt...)

<b>

"Well, take it easy."

<b>

Having lost interest in the two, Fluke completely dismissed the conversation from his mind.

<b>

"Well then, I don't want to disturb you two, so I'm off."

"Come on! It's not like you're bothering us! If you're going somewhere, I'm going too!"

"Sorry, but I have work to do now."

"At this hour, you’re going yourself?"

<b>

Parker expressed surprise at Fluke, who always led many underlings.

<b>

"Since my manpower has decreased, I have to check the site myself."

"That sounds... tough, brother! If you need anything, just call me anytime!"

"Yeah! When that happens, I'll count on you. I expect great things from you."

<b>

As he released his hand from Katia's shoulder and stood up, Fluke quietly muttered to himself so that only the two could hear, "Well, if you can use me moderately, I'll welcome you."

But he didn't let any of those thoughts show.

<b>

Turning his back to the two, Fluke waved goodbye with a friendly smile, took out a memo from his pocket, and looked at it suspiciously, muttering, "Rodrigo...? Hah! What kind of code is this?" and quickly walked away.
