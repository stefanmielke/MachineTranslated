# 134 Episode 134 Purple House Defense Line

The men, their blood rushing to their heads, came barreling toward Cordillera in a straight line.

Cordelia, who had been gaining hate as if aiming at herself, raises her mouth, which is hidden by a fan, in a small gesture.

<blank>

Annie, who was standing beside him, removed the pochette from her shoulder and began to twirl it around in her hand.

<blank>

One of the men saw this and twisted his face disgustedly. It was the man who had tangled with Annie earlier.

<blank>

He's just a kid, huh? There's no way a big man can take damage from waving that thing around. This is the payback for mocking a grown man earlier. I'm going to hurt you a little.

<blank>

The man redirected his foot, which had been facing Cordilia, toward Annie and slammed the sap he was holding toward it in an attempt to dispel its swinging pochette.

<blank>

Instantly, I felt a strong impact on my hand and my arm was flung in the opposite direction.

The bludgeoning weapon he was carrying was also sent flying somewhere.

I looked at my right hand, which felt the impact without understanding what it meant, and saw that my wrist was bent in a funny direction.

<blank>

I'm going to go to the airport and see what's going on! What the hell is this?

<blank>

As I realized the devastation of my wrist and involuntarily exclaimed, I now felt an unusual shock and pain in my left knee.

<blank>

Ngiiiiaaaaahhh!!!!"

<blank>

The knee, gulp! Gobble! Boom! The sound of the knee cracking is transmitted from inside the body via bone conduction.

The knee joint was compressed and broken in a direction it should not have been bent.

The man rolls around on the ground, unable to catch himself as he is sent flying by the impact that hit him in the knee.

His right wrist is also broken, so he cannot support himself properly.

<blank>

He finally moves his body and sits down as if he were slumped on the spot, "Ahhhhhhhh," he says, his mouth agape, confused, unable to comprehend the current situation.

I can only whimper as I look into his eyes, alternating between his broken right wrist and his broken left knee.

<blank>

<blank>

Annie took aim at the pochette she was wielding to put a stop to the man.

Suzy has taught me that I should not relax my hand until the enemy stops moving. Annie has no intention of making any moves here and now.

<blank>

The pochette, which is also this magical tool, gains mass and hardness greatly for that small amount of time at the moment of impact when it is swung quickly and hit the object.

If the weapon is swung sufficiently and its rotational speed is increased before hitting the target, its destructive power will be extraordinary even if used by a young child.

<blank>

Susie explained to me, "Its power is greater than even Tyson's when he was active!" but Annie had no idea what that meant.

I didn't know what to expect, but I was very excited to hear Suzy's further words, "If it's just some street thugs, I'm sure they'll break your jaw! I was very excited to hear Suzy's further words, "If it's just a street thug, I can crush his jaw for sure!

It was a stark contrast to the uniformly scrunched-up faces of the servants in the mansion who heard the conversation.

It seems that the Amcam temperament lives on in her deeply.

<blank>

Annie adjusted the trajectory of the pochette she was swinging and aimed it at the head, which was now at the right height, of a man who was sitting up, his knees shattered and screaming in pain.

He then aimed it at the man's side of the head and swung it as hard as he could.

<blank>

Bakin! The man's body flew two or three meters to the side from there and stopped moving.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At about the same time that the first man swung his bludgeoning weapon toward Annie, the man at the front of the line raised a baton-like object in his hand toward Cordelia.

<blank>

The baton is a heavy object with an iron core.

The man was about to slam it into her shoulder.

The collarbone of such a slender body could easily be smashed and broken. It would make it impossible for him to raise his arms, and it would also deprive him of the energy to resist.

When I imagine the arrogant face I just saw distorted into a pitiful smile, my mouth naturally relaxes.

<blank>

Cordelia held the fan in her left hand in a backhanded position as if to "catch" it.

The man saw this and smiled through his teeth, wondering if Cordelia was about to receive a baton with that fan.

<blank>

You're going to take this for that? She's a pretty young lady, isn't she?

<blank>

Just as he was about to change the aim of his baton, thinking that he might break Cordelia's hand, he felt a slight discomfort.

The weight of my feet as if they were moving in water, and the strange resistance in my arms as I swing them down.

A man who is not familiar with magic cannot understand that this is the protective effect of the "force field" used by the priests.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Cordelia watched in silence as the man's arm slowly swung down.

I should have been shaking a little earlier, but now I am so calm.

Once the bile is set, they can afford to look around.

I remember being taught something like that a long time ago.

<blank>

<blank>

Cody doesn't have to try to do things the hard way.

But! I wish I could do it that way!"

I don't think Cody is cut out for this kind of thing.

"Eva~~"

I'll always protect him! I'll always protect you!"

<blank>

For some reason, old memories come back to me.

When I was still much, much younger.

That was when I was selfishly asking Karen in the front yard overlooking the rose garden to teach me the same thing she did.

Karen had a troubled look on her face from start to finish.

<blank>

But even so! There may come a time when Karen is in danger!"

...... Okay, Cody. I'll make sure you're protected when I do. Please!"

I'll leave it to you! I promise you, too! I promise!

<blank>

Karen was smiling like the sun.

Now I suddenly remember that.

<blank>

But I couldn't keep my promise when you were going through the hardest time of your life.

<blank>

But this time ...... this time I will show you that I will keep my promise!

<blank>

<blank>

Cordelia receives the swinging baton with her left fan in a calm movement.

<blank>

Sturgeon!!!!"

<blank>

A small white mass shot out from its shoulder toward the man at the same time as Cordelia's cry.

It circles around the man's face with quick movements, and then disappears immediately.

<blank>

!!!"

<blank>

The man stepped back from the cordillera as quickly as he could because of something flying at him.

Did he hit something? and touched his face, but nothing in particular.

<blank>

What the hell did you do? ...... he?"

<blank>

Cordelia's mouth turned up in a sneer, and the man raised his voice, but the next moment the strength left his legs and he collapsed to his knees.

<blank>

Let me guess!

<blank>

Annie, who had just delivered a good blow to one man's temple, exclaimed.

Cordilia, holding a second fan in her right hand, hears the voice and lowers her foot back.

<blank>

Annie swung her pochette, which still had the momentum from blowing the man away just now, at the other man who kneeled down and exposed his face to her.

The pochette was sucked into the man's jaw, and he was blown away just like the other one, making a funny sound.

<blank>

Two!"

<blank>

Annie muttered emphatically in a small voice.

<blank>

<blank>

A third man was raising a wooden sword in an attempt to strike Cordelia, who had dropped back.

However, Catherine pointed her wand at the man and released the magic she had been chanting.

<blank>

Easy Sleep."

The man was hit by the calming magic used by the priest and instantly lost consciousness and collapsed on the spot.

He was the only one of the three allowed to peacefully relinquish his consciousness.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I said, "Nah? Nah ......, why ...... are you kidding!"

<blank>

Parker, who had been advancing behind the men, backed away when he saw that the three men were instantly struck down one by one.

<blank>

Shit! Shit! It's Milia again! Milia again! Goddamn it!

<blank>

Parker glares hatefully at Cordelia and the others and grits his teeth.

<blank>

There! What are you doing?

<blank>

Surprised by the sudden voice from behind, Cordelia and the others turn around.

Then there they were, the guards appeared from the corner of the building.

<blank>

"Shit! The guards are really coming!"

Ah? Oh, wait! Sturgeon! Please!

I'm like, "Uh, wow? ...... kuso!"

<blank>

When Parker saw the guards, he rushed off in the opposite direction from where they were coming.

Cordelia noticed this and tried to follow Parker, but was unable to do so immediately because the fallen men were in the way.

Immediately, Cordilia instructed her followers to try to stop him.

Parker, however, quickly regained his footing and drove away.

<blank>

I was too far away from ....... I was the one who had to secure it the most."

"...... Dear Ms. Cordelia."

<blank>

Sturgeon, Cordelia's follower, can use skills that affect the target's perception, such as "showing illusions" and "disrupting the motor center.

But even that can only be used properly if the master, Cordilleran, supplies the magic from nearby.

The slightest opening of distance drastically reduces the power of their skills.

Cordelia muttered in frustration that the target had already left the effective distance.

<blank>

<blank>

You are the daughter of the Cloud family, aren't you? May I ask what's going on?"

I didn't know you were already here. You are here much sooner than I expected.

<blank>

One of the soldiers who came hurried over to Annie and began asking her about her current situation.

Annie was surprised that the guards had arrived much earlier than she had thought and began to explain the situation.

<blank>

<blank>

Lucille was surprised to see the facility surrounded by guards, and as soon as she put the cake she had bought inside, she immediately carpet-bombed Cordelia and Catherine on the spot for their recklessness.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Today Karen was told in advance that the facility's caretaker and his wife would not be back until the evening.

So today, I was going to get off work early and go to the twins' early, and if there were any household chores still left to be done at the facility, I would take care of them myself.

<blank>

We are always happy to do what we can for the couple who have been so kind to Dan and Nan.

The other day, I gave him a small increase in salary because he was promoted to the D rank a little earlier than Suzy and the others, and I asked him to use the money, which he was very happy about.

<blank>

If I can be useful in what I can do now, there is nothing that would make me happier.

<blank>

But for some reason, when I came near the facility, there was a lot of noise around me today.

When I arrived at the front of the facility, I found that there were many guards surrounding the facility.

<blank>

Witnessing this, Karen is stunned.

What the hell happened at the facility?

<blank>

What do you mean? What? Cody?

<blank>

Thank you very much. May I speak to Karen Merlin, please?"

Huh?" Yes, that's right. Oh, you're ......?"

I am Annie Cloud, cousin of your sister Susie. You may have greeted me at the store the other day."

Oh! That time! This is very rude ......"

No, it's a situation. May I make a statement about the current situation?"

"Oh, ....... Oh, please, can you do ......?"

<blank>

Karen's anxiety was aroused by the atmosphere in the area, and as she listened to Annie's explanation, she began to lose her color.

<blank>

The way he talks, I think he is targeting Karen, Dan, and Nan.

"Oh, no, you don't ...... me? Why? Why are you two ......"

I am sure that will be clarified by Eishi-sama and the others in their pursuit. For now, please do not leave the building with the two of them.

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Cloud. Those girls have been a great help to us. I don't know how to thank you ......"

I've been friends with both of them since they first met, and we've remained close to this day.

Thank you so much for your help in getting back to us. ...... and thank you all for your help."

"......, uh, no, no, I'm ......."

Dear "Co............ Casper. Mr. Moore. Thank you very much. Please leave the rest to me and rest yourselves.

"......aa"

Thank you very much. Now if you'll excuse me."

<blank>

Karen bowed deeply on the spot with a pallid face and disappeared into the facility without making eye contact with anyone.

Two guards stand on either side of the door as if guarding its entrance.

<blank>

"...... Karen."

<blank>

Cordelia lowered her eyebrows as if trying to hold something back, clasped her hands on her chest, and looked away from the small back that disappeared into the door.

Annie was standing beside her, quietly looking up at the profile of the cordillera.
