# Chapter 134: Purple House Defense Line

The men, blood rushing to their heads, charged straight towards Cordelia.

Cordelia, who had been gathering hate aimed at her, raised the corners of her mouth slightly, hiding it behind her fan.

<b>

Nearby, Annie removed the pouch she had slung over her shoulder and began to spin it in her hand.

<b>

One of the men, who had previously engaged with Annie, twisted his face in a nasty way.

<b>

Just a kid, huh?! No matter how much she swings that thing around, there's no way it can hurt a grown man. This is payback for mocking the adults earlier. I'll make him feel a little pain.

<b>

The man redirected his steps from Cordelia to Annie, aiming to swat the spinning pouch away with the sap he held.

<b>

In an instant, he felt a strong impact in his hand, and his arm was jerked in the opposite direction.

The weapon he was holding was also sent flying somewhere.

Confused by the sudden impact, he looked at his right hand, only to see his wrist bent at an unnatural angle.

<b>

"What! What the hell is this?!"

<b>

Realizing the state of his wrist, he let out a scream, and then an unusual shock and pain shot through his left knee.

<b>

"Ngyaaaahhh!!!"

<b>

The sounds of his knee cracking—crunch! snap! crack!—echoed through his body via bone conduction.

His knee joint was crushed in a direction it should never bend.

The impact to his knee sent him tumbling to the ground without even being able to brace himself.

With his right wrist broken, he couldn't support his body properly.

<b>

Finally managing to move, he collapsed to the ground, gasping, "Ahih, Ahif," confused and unable to comprehend the situation.

With wide eyes, he alternated between looking at his broken right wrist and his shattered left knee, only able to let out cries of despair.

<b>

Annie aimed the spinning pouch at the man to deliver the final blow.

She had been taught by Suzy, "You must not let up until the enemy stops moving." The thought of showing mercy never crossed Annie's mind.

<b>

This magical pouch, when swung quickly and impacting the target, temporarily increases its mass and hardness for that brief moment.

If swung sufficiently and at high rotational speed, even a child could unleash an extraordinary destructive power.

<b>

Suzy had explained, "Its power surpasses even that of Tyson in his prime!" but Annie had no idea what that meant.

She didn't understand, but Suzy's further words, "It can definitely shatter the jaw of a street thug!" greatly boosted her excitement.

The servants in the mansion, who had overheard this, all had faces twisted in fear, which was a stark contrast.

It seemed the Amukamu temperament was firmly alive within her.

<b>

Annie, having crushed the man's knee and causing him to cry out in pain, adjusted the trajectory of the spinning pouch to aim at his head.

Then, she swung it down with full force towards the man's temple.

<b>

With a sound like something hard breaking and a noise reminiscent of a squashed frog escaping from his throat, the man's body flew sideways for 2 to 3 meters and then lay still.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As the first man swung his weapon at Annie, the man at the front raised a baton-like object towards Cordelia.

<b>

The baton was a heavy object with iron in its core.

The man intended to smash it down onto her shoulder.

Such a delicate body could easily have its collarbone shattered. That would prevent her from raising her arms and sap her will to resist.

Imagining the pitiful distortion of the arrogant face he had shown earlier made him grin.

<b>

Cordelia held the fan in her left hand in a reverse grip, preparing to "receive" the blow.

Seeing this, the man laughed, baring his teeth, thinking Cordelia intended to block the baton with that fan.

<b>

Is she really going to try to block this with that? What a cute little lady!

<b>

Just as he was about to change his aim to smash her hand along with the fan, he felt a slight sense of discomfort.

It felt as if his feet were heavy, moving through water, and there was an unusual resistance in his swinging arm.

The man, who was not well-versed in magic, could not comprehend that this was the effect of the priest's "Force Field" protection.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Cordelia quietly watched the man's arm slowly descend.

Though she had been trembling just moments ago, she was now remarkably calm.

Once her resolve was set, she found herself able to take in her surroundings.

She recalled a time when someone had taught her such things.

<b>

<b>

"You don't have to force yourself to do something difficult, Cordy."

"But, but! I want to try doing it like that too!"

"I don't think this kind of thing suits you, Cordy."

"Ugh..."

"Don't worry, Cordy! I'll always protect you!"

<b>

For some reason, memories from long ago resurfaced.

When she was much younger.

It was when she had been in the front yard overlooking the rose garden, selfishly asking Karen, "Teach me the same things you taught Karen."

Karen had always looked troubled.

<b>

"But! What if something dangerous happens to you?!"

"…Alright, Cordy. When that time comes, I'll definitely protect you. Please!"

"Leave it to me! I promise! Absolutely!!"

<b>

Karen had shown a sunny smile like the sun.

Now, she suddenly recalled such things.

<b>

But you couldn't keep your promise when you needed it the most.

<b>

But this time… this time, I will keep my promise!!

<b>

<b>

Cordelia calmly received the descending baton with her left fan.

<b>

"Sturgeon!!"

<b>

A small white mass shot out from Cordelia's shoulder towards the man at the same time as her shout.

It quickly circled around the man's face before disappearing somewhere.

<b>

"!!"

<b>

The man instinctively stepped back a pace from Cordelia as something flew towards him.

Did something hit him? He touched his face but felt nothing.

<b>

"W-What did you do?!… Huh?"

<b>

The man shouted at Cordelia, who had a defiant smirk, but the next moment, his legs gave way, and he crumpled to his knees.

<b>

"I hit him!!"

<b>

Annie, who had just landed a solid blow to one man's temple, shouted.

Cordelia, holding a second fan in her right hand, heard that voice and stepped back.

<b>

Annie, still riding the momentum from blowing away the man, swung the pouch towards another man who had knelt down, exposing his face.

The pouch struck the man's jaw, and he emitted a strange sound as he too was sent flying like the other.

<b>

"Second one!"

<b>

Annie whispered strongly in a small voice.

<b>

<b>

The third man raised his wooden sword to strike Cordelia, who had stepped back.

But Catherine cast a spell at that man with her wand.

<b>

"Easy Sleep"

The man, struck by the priest's calming magic, instantly lost consciousness and collapsed to the ground.

He was the only one among the three allowed to peacefully relinquish his awareness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"W-What… why… this has to be a joke!"

<b>

Parker, who had been advancing from behind the men, stepped back as he witnessed the three being taken down in an instant.

<b>

"Damn it! Damn it!! It's Millia again! Damn it!!!"

<b>

Parker glared at Cordelia and the others with hatred, grinding his teeth.

<b>

"Hey! What are you doing?!!"

<b>

Startled by the sudden voice from behind, Cordelia and the others turned around.

There, soldiers appeared from around the corner of the building.

<b>

"Tch! Are the guards really coming?!"

"Huh?! W-Wait! Sturgeon! Please!!"

"W-What?!… Damn it!"

<b>

Parker, seeing the guards, hurriedly ran in the opposite direction from where they were coming.

Noticing this, Cordelia tried to chase after Parker, but the fallen men blocked her path, preventing her from pursuing immediately.

In a panic, Cordelia instructed her familiar to try to stop him.

But though Parker stumbled, he quickly regained his footing and ran away.

<b>

"I've fallen too far behind… He was the one I needed to secure the most."

"…Lady Cordelia."

<b>

Cordelia's familiar, Sturgeon, could use skills that affect the target's perception, such as "showing illusions" and "disrupting motor functions."

However, this could only be effectively used if Cordelia was nearby to supply magical energy.

Even a slight increase in distance greatly reduced the power of those skills.

Realizing that the target had already moved out of effective range, Cordelia muttered in frustration.

<b>

<b>

"Are you the lady of the Cloud family? May I ask about the situation?"

"Ah, you've arrived. Much sooner than I expected."

<b>

One of the soldiers hurried over to Annie and began to inquire about the situation.

Annie, surprised by how quickly the guards had arrived compared to what she had anticipated, began explaining the circumstances.

<b>

<b>

Before long, Lucille, who had joined them, was astonished to see the facility surrounded by guards. She quickly placed the cake she had bought inside the facility and immediately launched a barrage of scolding at Cordelia and Catherine for their reckless actions.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

Today, Karen had been informed in advance that the couple managing the facility would not return until the evening.

So, she planned to leave work early and head to the twins, intending to take care of any household chores that remained in the facility.

<b>

She always did what she could for the couple who took care of Dan and Nan.

Recently, she had been promoted to D-rank, slightly earlier than Suzy and the others, and was thrilled to give them a small increase in her pay.

<b>

If she could be of help with what she could do now, there was nothing more delightful.

<b>

However, as she approached the facility, she noticed an unusual commotion around.

Pushing through the larger-than-usual crowd, she arrived in front of the facility, only to find many guards surrounding it.

<b>

Seeing this scene, Karen was left in shock.

What on earth happened at the facility?

<b>

"W-What’s going on? Huh? C-Cordy?"

<b>

"I apologize. Are you Karen Merlin?"

"Y-Yes, that’s me. A-Are you…?"

"I am Annie Cloud, Suzy's cousin. I believe we exchanged greetings at the shop the other day."

"Oh! From that time! I-I’m terribly sorry for this…"

"No, given the circumstances, it’s understandable. May I explain the current situation?"

"…Oh. C-Can you please?"

<b>

Karen, stirred by the tense atmosphere, lost her color with each explanation she received from Annie.

<b>

"It seems that if we can silence the mouths of the thugs, the truth will become clear, but it appears that they are targeting you, Dan, and Nan based on your tone."

"W-What?! Me? Why? Why them too…?"

"That will likely be clarified through the inquiries of the authorities. For now, please refrain from leaving the building with the two of them."

<b>

"Thank you, Lady Cloud. Those children have been a great help to me. I don’t know how to express my gratitude…"

"I’ve been fortunate to have a bond with them until today."

"I truly appreciate it. …And thank you to everyone as well."

"…Ah, n-no, I…"

"Co… Casper. Moore. Thank you very much. Please leave the follow-up to me, and you all should rest your bodies."

"…Ah."

"Thank you very much. Now, I will take my leave."

<b>

With a pale face, Karen bowed deeply and disappeared into the facility without making eye contact with anyone.

Two guards stood at the entrance, guarding it.

<b>

"…Karen."

<b>

Cordelia lowered her brow as if holding something back, tightly gripping her hand placed on her chest, watching the small back that disappeared through the door.

Annie quietly looked up at Cordelia's profile beside her.
