# Chapter 123: The Wish of Deep Green

Before the mock battle began, while watching the backs of Ruuri and the others in front of the locker room, Mia-chan said.

<b>

"Don't worry. Since Su-chan asked me, I'll protect Karen-chan, okay?"

"Eh? Th-that's..."

"But you know, I don't really like Karen-chan that much."

"Eh?"

<b>

"Because Karen-chan is strong, right?"

"…N-no, I’m not strong at all…"

"You’re totally strong, and I just don’t get why you’re being protected like that. I can't really express it well, but I feel like that's a bit different."

"…………"

"I'm sure Bibi-chan feels the same way."

<b>

"But since Su-chan decided to protect Karen-chan, I’ll also protect her."

<b>

<b>

Mia-chan's words from that time weigh heavily in my heart.

<b>

It's natural for Mia-chan to dislike me.

Everyone in Amukamu, starting with Su-chan, are truly amazing people.

The fact that someone like me is allowed to be among them is like a miracle.

<b>

In that context, it's only natural that I, who is being unilaterally protected by Su-chan, wouldn't be viewed positively.

<b>

…But I really enjoyed sparring with Alicia-senpai and the people from Amukamu.

I wonder how many years it’s been since I had that much fun.

<b>

Ever since my uncle encouraged me to master magic, I had stopped such training, and I think I haven’t done it for about two years…

<b>

If only I could advance to the Empty Fist Department and practice with more people, how enjoyable that would be…

<b>

But I know that wishing for such things is not appropriate.

I must follow my uncle's instructions and repay my debt quickly. For Dan and Nan's sake, I can't afford to be distracted by other matters.

<b>

Amidst all this, Mia-chan's words resonated deeply within me.

<b>

<b>

…However, just as much as Mia-chan's words, the gaze of that child at that time also lingers in my heart.

<b>

That tearful, sorrowful gaze.

<b>

The fact that I made that child wear such an expression chokes me up.

<b>

Something that I had tucked away deep inside begins to bubble up.

Before I knew it, a deep sigh escaped my lips.

<b>

"Are you worried about something?"

"Ah, no, um…"

<b>

Was my sigh louder than I thought?

I can feel my face heat up from being overheard and suddenly addressed.

<b>

<b>

This is a corner of the rose garden within the academy.

<b>

This place resembles the rose garden I know very much, and strangely, it brings me peace.

Since I found this place after enrolling, whenever I have time, I visit here, sit on this garden bench, and spend quiet moments.

<b>

When I first came here, a part of the hedge was gouged out, as if there had been some accident, but now it has been beautifully restored.

<b>

The person who just spoke to me is the gardener who manages this rose garden. Surely, the restoration of that broken hedge was also thanks to this person's efforts.

<b>

I became acquainted with this gardener during my time here, and they always joyfully and carefully teach me about roses, and before I knew it, we had become comfortable enough to chat.

<b>

Perhaps they finished their work, as today they are wearing a white, refreshing shirt instead of their usual work clothes. When they asked, "Can I sit?" and I replied, "Of course," they smiled and sat down at the edge of the bench.

<b>

"I'm sorry for being rude. …But I understand."

"Eh?"

<b>

"When I'm here, I can't help but feel at ease, or let my guard down…"

"…………"

<b>

"I sometimes find myself voicing my weaknesses… I know it's embarrassing for a grown man to complain to roses, but…"

<b>

The person scratched their cheek with a slightly embarrassed smile.

<b>

"I-I understand! This place… it always makes me feel relieved. It's like I'm sitting in my own home’s rose garden… it makes me feel that way."

<b>

"…………Is that really true? If so, as someone who nurtures this place, those are truly grateful words! It's a more delightful response than any praise."

<b>

The words I blurted out made the person respond with a childlike smile.

<b>

Their usually sleepy gray eyes are now very gentle.

Normally, they wear a straw hat, so it doesn't stand out much, but today, without a hat, their soft chestnut hair sways in the wind, scattering a bit of light.

<b>

That smile gives a strange sense of nostalgia and comfort, which is very soothing.

Perhaps because of that, I find myself letting out my weaknesses.

<b>

"…I don’t deserve to be helped."

"…………"

"There are people who will help me… Someone told me to take their hand… But I don’t think I have the right to respond to those people."

<b>

The person watches me quietly, as if to absorb the words I let slip. After a moment of looking up as if thinking about something, they slowly turned their face back to me.

In that gaze, I felt warmth beyond what I had felt before.

<b>

"…The value of a person is not something one can understand by oneself, nor can it be decided by oneself."

<b>

The voice of the person who began to speak quietly was very gentle, and it felt as if they were softly trying to tell me something. I don't know why, but it felt very nostalgic, and I couldn't take my eyes off this person.

<b>

"At the very least, your friends don’t care about the qualifications or value you think you have."

<b>

Ah, I see… my father.

I remembered my father when I heard this person's words.

<b>

"And this is a bit meddlesome, or perhaps just maternal concern… a request, perhaps?"

<b>

"？…A request?"

<b>

"If there are friends who reach out their hands, please take that hand. I believe that hand is extended with all the courage they can muster. But surely, you will also need courage to take that hand. However, please face that courage of theirs."

<b>

I don't know why I remembered my father.

But right now, I feel a part of myself wanting to properly accept those words and that gaze that looks straight at me.

<b>

"Without even reaching out, rejecting a future plagued by regret, and while harboring fear, you must have extended your hand. Please, please take that hand when the time comes…"

<b>

I silently listened to the serious gaze and words of that person.

<b>

Then, suddenly, they looked away from me and began to scratch their cheek with a shy smile.

<b>

"No, I'm sorry. It feels like I'm saying something strange. This is really a big meddling."

<b>

"That’s not it… But I didn’t quite understand, yet I could tell that you are genuinely worried about me."

<b>

"…………Your eyes resemble your mother’s."

<b>

"Eh? You know my mother…? You know my mother!?"

<b>

I was surprised by the sudden words as they looked at me with a serious gaze.

I instinctively thought they might know my mother and asked, but the person simply shook their head quietly.

<b>

"No… I just thought so, that’s all."

<b>

Saying that, the person once again smiled gently, their eyes lighting up with joy.
