# 123 Deep Green Wish

Before the mock battle began, Mia said as she watched Lurie and her team's backs in front of the locker room.

<blank>

I'll be fine. Sue has asked me to protect you, Karen, okay?"

What? Well, that's ......"

But I don't really like you, Karen .......

Huh?"

<blank>

Because you're so strong, Karen.

"......, no, no, I can't ...... be so ...... strong."

I don't know if I can understand how he can just be protected, even though he is so strong. I can't say it well, but I don't think it's right to say it like that.

"............"

I'm sure Bibi feels the same way.

<blank>

But since Sue has decided to protect Karen-chan, I will protect her, too.

<blank>

<blank>

Mia's words at that time remain heavy in my heart.

<blank>

No wonder Mia hates me.

Sue and the rest of the people at AMCAM are really great people.

It is truly a miracle that someone like myself is allowed to be among them.

<blank>

In such a situation, I still feel it is natural that Sue, who is at the center of everyone, does not think well of me, who is unilaterally protected.

<blank>

I enjoyed standing with Alicia senior and the Amcam people at ...... as well.

I haven't had that much fun in years.

<blank>

I had stopped doing this kind of training after my uncle advised me to practice magic, and in fact, I think I hadn't done it for about two years. ......

<blank>

How fun it would be if I could go on to the Kuken Department if possible and meet more people in hand-to-hand combat. ......

<blank>

But I know that's not what we should want.

I must follow my uncle's instructions and return the favor as soon as possible. For the sake of Dan and Nan, I can't keep being distracted by other things.

<blank>

Mia's words, spoken in such a context, rang very heavily in my mind.

<blank>

<blank>

......, but as much as Mia's words, I just can't get her eyes off my mind at that moment.

<blank>

Those wistful eyes that look like they are about to cry.

<blank>

It chokes me up to have made that girl look like that again.

<blank>

The things I had been keeping deep in my heart began to well up.

Before I knew it, a deep exhale escaped me without me even realizing it.

<blank>

"Something on your mind?"

Oh, no, that ......

<blank>

Was the sigh I let out louder than I expected?

I can feel my face heat up at the fact that people have heard it and suddenly called out to me.

<blank>

<blank>

This is a part of the rose garden in the school.

<blank>

This place looks very much like the rose garden I know and is strangely calming.

Since I entered the school and found Coco, I have been visiting this place whenever I have time, sitting on this garden bench, and being allowed to spend some quiet time.

<blank>

When I first came here, some of the hedges were gutted, as if there had been some kind of accident, but they are now neatly trimmed.

<blank>

The person who just called out to me is the gardener who maintains this rose garden. I am sure that the restoration of the broken hedge was also his effort.

<blank>

I became acquainted with this gardener while I was spending time here, and he was always polite and happy to tell me about roses, and before I knew it, I found myself talking with him at ease.

<blank>

Perhaps it is after work, but today he is wearing a cool white shirt instead of his usual work clothes. May I sit down? He smiled and sat down on the edge of the bench.

<blank>

'Sorry, that was rude. I understand, even at ......."

Huh?"

<blank>

"When I'm here, I just end up feeling at ease, or I feel at ease. ......

"............"

<blank>

"There are times when I get carried away and speak my mind in a weak ...... manner. I'm aware that it's embarrassing for a big man to complain about a rose. ......

<blank>

The person scratched his cheek with a slightly embarrassed giggle.

<blank>

Wow, I know what you mean! I always feel at home here at ....... It's as if I'm sitting in my own rose garden ......, that's how I feel."

<blank>

I'm sure you've heard the question, "Is ............ true? If so, as the person who raised this place, I really appreciate it! That's more than any praise I've ever received."

<blank>

I couldn't help but respond, and the person responded with a childlike smile all over his face.

<blank>

His gray eyes, always sleepy, are very kind now.

By day, she wears a straw hat, so it doesn't really stand out, but today, when she is not wearing a hat, her soft chestnut hair is swaying in the wind, shimmering slightly.

<blank>

It is a smile that is strangely nostalgic and reassuring.

Perhaps that's why I let a few weak words slip out of my mouth.

<blank>

I don't deserve your help."

"............"

"There is someone who can help. ....... There were people who told me to take their hands ....... But I don't feel qualified to respond to those people."

<blank>

The person looked at me silently, as if to catch my words, as if to watch over me. Then he turned his head upward for a few moments as if he was thinking about something, and then slowly turned his head here again.

I feel more warmth in his eyes than I had ever felt before.

<blank>

...... human value is not something you can know, much less determine."

<blank>

As she began to speak quietly, her voice was so gentle that it seemed as if she was gently reminding me. I don't know why, but it made me feel very nostalgic, and I could not take my eyes off this person.

<blank>

At least I don't think your friends care about your qualifications, your worthiness, or whatever else you think they care about.

<blank>

Ah, yes, ......, it's your father.

I was thinking of your father in his words.

<blank>

And this is a meddle, or an old woman, or ...... please?"

<blank>

?" ...... please,?"

<blank>

If you have a friend who extends a hand to you, please take that hand and give it to them. I'm sure that hand was extended with all the courage you could muster. But I am sure that you also need courage to take that hand. But please face the other person's courage.

<blank>

I don't know why I remembered your father.

But now I find myself willing to accept his words and his eyes that look straight at me.

<blank>

I am sure that you did not even reach out your hand, but you reached out in fear, refusing to accept a future tormented by regrets. Please, please, please take my hand and lift it up then. ......"

<blank>

I just listened in silence to the seriousness of his eyes and the story he was telling.

<blank>

Then he suddenly took his eyes off me and started scratching his cheeks with a bashful smile on his face.

<blank>

'No, I'm sorry. What are you saying? It's like. This is a really big deal."

<blank>

I didn't understand what you were saying at ....... But I wasn't sure, but I could see that you were seriously concerned."

<blank>

............Your eyes are like your mother's, aren't they?"

<blank>

What?" You know my mother, ......, you know my mother!"

<blank>

Looking at me with serious eyes, I was surprised at what he suddenly said.

I asked him if he knew my mother, but he just shook his head quietly.

<blank>

'No, ......, I don't think so. I just thought."

<blank>

The person smiled happily, his eyes once again breaking into a kindly smile.
