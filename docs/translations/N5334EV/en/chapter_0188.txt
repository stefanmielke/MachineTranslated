# Chapter 176: Chidori

Is it possible that a mere thief is somewhat endearing if they are just a down-and-out person?

When one commits a crime due to unavoidable circumstances, and it becomes a habit, there is no turning back.

I remember reading somewhere that in the old Edo period, even light robbery was punishable by death.

<b>

In modern times, this country is not much different.

<b>

That is why Mr. Roderick thinks he wants to help them before it comes to that.

Judging by the standards of this world, that is quite a naive thought. However, it is also a fact that there are a certain number of people who want to support Mr. Roderick's feelings.

<b>

<b>

However, when it comes to large organizations, the quality becomes exponentially worse.

They consider people to be prey to be plundered, just like money and livestock.

Villages attacked by them leave almost no corpses behind.

Horrifyingly, they even "efficiently utilize" even a single fragment of the human body.

<b>

In this country, human trafficking has been prohibited for over 100 years. However, there are still many surrounding countries where this is not the case.

It is said that many are sold as labor to such places, but a certain number of people are dismembered alive and used for horrific experiments.

<b>

I have witnessed such a scene before.

It was a horrifying act that made even the tortures of hell seem mild, inducing nausea.

The victims were dismembered and immersed in magical solutions, not allowed to die or lose their sanity, treated like experimental animals for necromancy.

It is not something that humans should do to other humans.

<b>

Since then, I have come to recognize that thieves are the same as magical beasts or pigs.

Rather, the thieves that appear in human settlements are more frequent and troublesome.

They are nothing but poison to this world. They are beings that should be swiftly eliminated upon discovery.

If even one of them is let go, it will eventually lead to dozens of victims.

<b>

<b>

I think we had been moving for nearly two hours since being loaded onto the carriage.

They probably blindfolded me to ensure I wouldn’t know where I was being taken, and took a long detour... but this is completely pointless.

The reason is!

I understand that I am currently located 4.6 kilometers north-northwest of Hexagom, at an altitude of 200 meters.

<b>

I must say, my grasp of location information is quite impressive. It makes me feel my own cheat-like abilities anew in situations like this.

<b>

<b>

After being taken off the carriage, I was once again shoved into a small room while still blindfolded. "Please wait here for a while," said the man who had been with me in the carriage.

Are they preparing for my welcome party or something?

<b>

During the journey, I had talked with that self-proclaimed "consultant" and learned most of what I wanted to know.

I also provided them with information they were curious about, but honestly, that doesn’t matter much.

<b>

To be clear, the rumor spread by the Bayros family that I am "Mr. Roderick's adopted child" is merely bait to make them feel inclined to kidnap me.

Now that they have brought me this far and confirmed their objective, the operation is practically complete.

<b>

If I had just talked to him normally this time, I am quite confident that I would have been manipulated by his rhetoric and ended up having information extracted from me unilaterally.

<b>

However, since I was able to discern the truth of what the other party was saying, I feel I managed to get through it without incident.

<b>

I wish I had a "skill" that could see through the other party's lies from the beginning, but unfortunately, I do not possess such a convenient thing.

However, I believe it is possible to some extent to sharpen my senses and read the other party's gaze, breathing, and heart rate to determine whether they are lying.

<b>

But this time, since I was blindfolded, I couldn't observe their gaze or pupil movements, so I tried a different approach.

<b>

What I did was "observe the other party's etheric body."

I observed the differences in the fluctuations of ether when they were telling the truth versus when they were lying.

<b>

It is likely that even if this time's opponent lied, they wouldn’t show the same kind of reflexes as an ordinary human.

So, I had no choice but to rely on the fluctuations of ether to make my judgment.

<b>

However, this method required a lot of concentration, so being blindfolded was actually helpful.

If I could see, I would have likely lost focus and not been able to read it properly.

Well, it turned out well in the end!

<b>

Thanks to that, I obtained all the information I wanted, and now I just have to do my job.

<b>

<b>

I was indeed brought into an old stone building.

I immediately sensed the smell of mossy stone as soon as I got off the carriage.

Perhaps they are illegally occupying some old historical site.

<b>

Speaking of which, I feel like I saw some documents mentioning the ruins of a fortress that was abandoned over 100 years ago around here... Is it that?

<b>

For now, there seems to be no sign of people around this room. I guess I will be left alone for a while?

I brought my hands, still shackled, close to my face and slightly lifted the blindfold with my right thumb.

Hmm, as expected, it’s an old stone wall. There’s no dampness, so it’s probably not underground. Some of the stones that make up the wall are chipped away, and I can see the night sky through the gaps.

<b>

I sharpen my senses to explore and grasp the terrain of this place and the presence of others.

<b>

In this remote place, the reactions of the thieves have already changed from the "red" felt in the city to "hostile reactions" sensed in the field.

This means that a considerable number of thieves have already gathered here... Huh? What about those that are not human?

The surroundings are completely filled with enemies. The number is roughly around 250?

It feels like a scale from a company to a battalion?

I see, this mass is the source of their confidence.

<b>

Outside, I feel the unique quietness of being on a mountain, but from various parts of this building, sounds of revelry seem to be coming through.

Well, it’s only natural that such a large number of people wouldn’t be quiet.

<b>

<b>

Then, shall I send out "Chidori" now?

I took one of the capsules sandwiched in my garter and infused it with magical power.

The capsule split in the middle with a crack, and the surface expanded to the sides, forming wings.

Then the capsule transformed into the shape of a small bird.

<b>

This capsule is actually a super miniature version of a "pigeon-type" clay golem called "Chidori."

Since Chidori is a smaller version, it cannot carry as much information as a pigeon.

The recording area can only hold about a dozen words worth of information. It’s like a short message.

Its flying distance is originally not very far, only a few hundred meters at most. It is also easily affected by magical interference, so it can only be used for short distances in urban areas.

<b>

However, this one has been magically modified by Marsh for my exclusive use.

Mainly, the performance of the magical battery has been enhanced, allowing a considerable amount of my magical power to be infused despite its small size.

In exchange, it can hardly maintain magical power, and within five minutes, most of the infused magical power will overflow.

However, the overflowing magical power has been customized to allow for ultra-high-speed flight.

The flight time is still about five minutes, but with that, it can easily cover a distance of over 100 kilometers.

This is a speed-focused, romantic performance magical tool specially made by Marsh!

<b>

I quickly recorded a message in it and released it through the gap in the stone. The message simply recorded the location information and the scale of the enemies.

If Bibi has the corresponding marker, this will be sufficient.

From here, it will reach her in just a little over 10 seconds, covering a distance similar to Hexagom.

<b>

<b>

Chidori, having silently exited through the gap in the stone, ascended about 100 meters and then flew away at supersonic speed towards Bibi.

When Chidori broke the sound barrier, a small explosion sound must have echoed in the sky, but there was no sign of anyone noticing or causing a commotion.

Is it drowned out by the noise of the revelry? Aren’t they a bit too relaxed?

Well, even if they noticed, it wouldn’t matter much anyway!
