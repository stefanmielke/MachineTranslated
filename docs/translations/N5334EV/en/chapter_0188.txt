# 176 Plovers

I wonder if bandits would still be cute if they were just a food snob.

Once a person commits a crime due to unavoidable circumstances and it becomes a habit, there is no going back.

I remember reading something about how in the olden days of Edo, ostracism was a death penalty, even if it was light.

<blank>

In this country today, it is much the same.

<blank>

That is why Roderick wants to do something about them before that happens.

Judging by this world's standards, that is a rather naive idea. However, it is also true that there are a certain number of people who would like to support Mr. Roderick's idea.

<blank>

<blank>

However, with larger organizations, the quality becomes so bad that it takes on another dimension.

They consider people as usurpable prey as well as money, livestock, etc.

Villages attacked by them rarely have even a corpse left.

They fearlessly use even a single piece of the human body for "effective use.

<blank>

Human trafficking has already been banned in this country for more than 100 years. However, there are still several neighboring countries where this is not the case.

Many are sold to such places as labor, but a certain number are dismembered while still alive and used in experiments that are even more horrifying to listen to.

<blank>

I have seen the scene before.

It was so nauseating and fearless that it made one think that the torments of hell were gentle.

The victims are cut limb from limb and dipped in a magical solution, and treated like experimental animals of necromancy, without being allowed to die or lose their sanity.

It is not something a person would do to another person.

<blank>

Since then, I have come to recognize the bandits as being the same as magical beasts and pigs.

The bandits who show up in the villages are much more likely to be encountered, and they are much worse.

They are nothing but a blight on the world. They should be eliminated as soon as they are discovered.

If we miss even one of these guys, we will eventually create dozens of times as many victims.

<blank>

I think we had been traveling for almost two hours since we were put on the wagon.

Perhaps they were blindfolded so that they wouldn't know where they were being taken, and they were also moving in a big circle around the road, but ...... this makes no sense at all.

Because!

I am 4.6 kilometers north-northwest of Hexargom in a straight line, at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level. I know that I am at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level, 4.6 kilometers north-northwest of Hexagom.

<blank>

My grasp of location information is really quite impressive. I feel once again that I am a cheat.

<blank>

<blank>

After being taken down from the wagon at the end of the day, I was again pushed into a small room, blindfolded. Wait here for a while," said the man who had been with him in the carriage.

Are they preparing for my welcome party?

<blank>

I talked with this self-proclaimed "advisor" all the way along the way and learned most of what I needed to know.

I would have given them information that they wanted to know, but, well, honestly, I don't care about that.

<blank>

To be clear, the rumor spread by the Byros family that I was "adopted by Mr. Roderick or something" was nothing more than bait to motivate them to kidnap me.

If they brought me here and confirmed the target, the mission was as good as complete.

<blank>

If I had only talked with him in a normal way, I am quite confident that I would have ended up being talked down to and having information dragged out of me one way or the other.

<blank>

However, I was able to discern the truth of the other party's story, and I think I managed to save the day.

<blank>

I wish I had the "skill" to see through their lies from the beginning, but unfortunately, I don't have anything useful like that.

But it is possible, to a certain extent, to sharpen your nerves and read their eyes, breathing, and heart rate to decipher whether they are lying or not.

<blank>

But this time I was blindfolded, so I couldn't observe her eye line or pupil movement, so I took a different approach.

<blank>

What we did was a method called 'observing the etheric body' of the other person.

They observed the difference between the etheric fluctuations when telling the truth and when telling a lie.

<blank>

Perhaps this time the other party, even if he lied, would not show the same kind of reflection as a normal human being.

So, for that guy, I had to judge him by the fluctuation of the ether.

<blank>

However, this method required a lot of concentration, so I was glad to be blindfolded.

If I had been able to see, I would have lost focus and would not have been able to read it well.

Well, the result is all right!

<blank>

Now that I have all the information I need, all I have to do is my job.

<blank>

<blank>

I was brought to a stone building that still looked old-fashioned.

He could smell the mossy stone as soon as he got out of the carriage.

Maybe they're squatting at some old historical site somewhere.

<blank>

Come to think of it, I think I've seen a document that says there are remains of a fort or something in this area that was abandoned over 100 years ago: ....... Is that around there?

<blank>

For now, there is no sign of anyone around this room. Does that mean it's going to be left alone for a while?

I brought my hand, still shackled, close to my face and used my right thumb to slide the blindfold up chock-full.

Hmmm, it is still an old-fashioned stone wall. There is no dampness, so it is probably not underground. The piled up stones that are the walls are chipped off in some places, and the night sky can be seen peeking through the gaps.

<blank>

Sharpen your nerves and understand the terrain of this place and all the opponents' presence by searching.

<blank>

In this remote location, the reaction of the bandits has already changed from the "red" they feel in the city to the "hostile reaction" they perceive on the field.

I guess that means there are already quite a few bandits here. ...... Huh? This one is non-human?

The whole area around us is full of enemies. There are about 250 of them.

Like company to battalion size?

I see, so this quantity of goods is the source of their leeway.

<blank>

Outside, there is a sense of quietness peculiar to mountain tops, but I can hear the echoes of drinking going on here and there in this erected building.

Well, there was no reason for such a large number of people to stay quiet, so it was only natural.

<blank>

<blank>

Then let's skip the "plover" while we're at it.

I took out one of the capsules that was tucked into the garter and poured magic power into it.

The capsule has a slit in the middle, from which the surface spreads out to the left and right as if it were cracking, and it takes the shape of a wing as it is.

The capsule then took the form of a small bird.

<blank>

This capsule is actually a very small version of a "pigeon-shaped" clay golem called a "plover.

The plover is a smaller version, so it cannot carry as much information as the dove.

The recording area will be filled with information for a dozen or so words at most. Is it like a short message?

It is not originally designed to fly very far; it can jump only a few hundred meters. It is also susceptible to magical interference, so it can only be used within a short distance in town.

<blank>

However, this one was modified by Mr. Marsh for my exclusive use.

The performance of the magic battery has been improved, and although it is small, it is capable of injecting a considerable amount of my magic power.

Instead, it is almost impossible to maintain the magic, and most of the caged magic will overflow in five minutes.

However, he has customized the kinked device to convert its overflowing magical power and enable it to fly at ultra-high speed.

The flight time is still about 5 minutes, but with that much time, the distance can be easily traveled over 100 kilometers.

This is Mr. Marsh's special magic tool, full of such speed-specific romantic performance!

<blank>

I quickly recorded a message on this and released it out through a gap in the stone. The message would be brief, recording only the location and the size of the enemy.

With Bibi, who has a pair of markers, this is enough.

It would take only a little more than 10 seconds to get there, about the distance of Hexagom from Coco.

<blank>

<blank>

The plover soundlessly exited through a gap in the stone, rose 100 meters or so, and from there flew away to Bibi, exceeding the speed of sound all at once.

When the plovers broke through the sound barrier, there should have been a small popping sound in the sky above, but they didn't seem to notice it and didn't seem to make a fuss about it.

Are they being drowned out by the booze-fueled revelry? Aren't these guys pretty warm?

Well, it doesn't really matter that they noticed!
