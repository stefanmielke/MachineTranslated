# Episode 26: Suzy Cloud's Match

"Su! You should come to the training ground today!"

<b>

It was suddenly said by Carla during lunchtime.

<b>

"Well, we graduate tomorrow. We'll still be here during the summer, but we can only practice at school today, right?"

<b>

Last week, we completed contracts for all attributes over five days.

Yesterday, under the guidance of the priest, we conducted trials for each attribute.

<b>

Is it a milestone in studying magic?

<b>

Suzy thought while munching on a thick roast beef clubhouse sandwich. Ah, the combination of beef and mustard brings happiness flowing in...

<b>

"It's not exactly the last memory, but... what do you think?"

<b>

In fact, over the past few days, Suzy's skill in holding back against Stephan had improved.

By softly wrapping her "ki," she had gained confidence in her ability to maneuver without injuring her opponent.

<b>

She named it "Friendly Finger."

With this, I don't think I'll accidentally hurt my opponent! she thought, puffing her cheeks in her mind.

<b>

"Okay... I understand... I'll go... today!"

"Really!? Yayyy! Su! I'm so happyyy!!"

<b>

For some reason, Dana hugged her.

<b>

"Mogumyu!"

"Huh? Su-chan is going? Then I have to go too! Yes! I have to watch over you properly!"

"You've completely become Su's guardian, huh?"

"If that's the case, then I might as well go watch too."

"Huh? Everyone's going? Then I'm going too! Vivi, aren't you coming?"

"I-I'm going! I have to anyway! I'm going! Right? Algernon!"

<b>

Kikikyu! replied the rodent.

It seems all the girls are heading to the training ground today.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Huh? Suzy is coming here today? Yayyy!!"

<b>

Irvin, looking unusually happy, approached Suzy as she headed to the training ground.

<b>

"Irvin? I think you're a bit too close!"

"Huh? Vivi? Why are you here too?"

"Am I not allowed to go!?"

"N-no! It's not that! I just thought it was unusual..."

"Don't worry, Irvin! I'll be the one guiding her!"

"Wha! Dana! W-wait!!"

<b>

Irvin hurriedly chased after Suzy, who was being taken away by the girls.

<b>

<b>

The training ground was like a log cabin, a small gym about 20 meters on each side.

The floor was just packed earth, resembling a large sumo practice area, Suzy thought.

<b>

"We're going to change, but... Su, you don't have a change of clothes, do you?"

<b>

Carla asked.

<b>

(Change of clothes? Like gym clothes? Hmm, what should I do? I didn't bring any... I don't want to get my clothes dirty, but I guess I just have to avoid sitting on the ground?)

<b>

"I don't... have... a change... but... I'm fine... like this!"

"No way! You'll get dirty! I'll lend you mine!"

<b>

Alicia said. "Huh? Won't it be too big for me?" Suzy replied.

<b>

"Don't worry, don't worry! Come on! I'll help you change!"

<b>

She happily pulled Suzy into the changing room.

<b>

<b>

The clothes she was made to wear were a white sleeveless T-shirt and light yellow wide pants.

The T-shirt was a bit big, and her shoulders were almost exposed.

The pants were folded multiple times to fit her.

<b>

"See! It's fine, right? Look! You look pretty cute!"

<b>

Alicia proudly pushed her in front of the other girls.

<b>

"I see! It really changes your image... This means we have plans for this summer!"

<b>

Suzy felt a slight chill from the giggling older girls.

<b>

<b>

In the end, she ended up dressed similarly to Alicia.

<b>

"Hehe, we look like sisters, right? Right?!"

<b>

Alicia said, wrapping her arm around Suzy's shoulder and rubbing her cheek against hers.

<b>

"Oh! That's so unfair!"

<b>

Carla exclaimed. And Carla's outfit was...

<b>

<b>

(Huh? Carla, isn't that black outfit a ninja costume? It's shorts, but it looks like a ninja outfit! With a forehead protector too! Is she a stealthy person?!)

Suzy felt a bit taken aback by the strange mix of cultures.

<b>

After changing, when they came out of the changing room, the children had already gathered, and the village adults who would be instructing them had entered the training ground.

<b>

The village adults took turns instructing at the training ground.

<b>

Today, it was Ryder Haggard.

He was Irvin's older brother.

<b>

Ryder was 24 this year and had served four years in the knight order of the royal capital until last year.

<b>

Looking over the children in the training ground, Ryder's eyes widened when he spotted Suzy, whom he had never seen before...

<b>

"...Huh? Ravi? ...Ravi! ...no way..."

<b>

His eyes widened, and he gasped.

The lively figure of a girl overlapped with Suzy in Ryder's eyes.

<b>

"Big brother! It's Suzy, from Cloud's place! She's here to train today!"

<b>

Ryder snapped back to reality at Irvin's words.

<b>

"I-I see! ...So you're Suzy! I've heard about you. I hope you can inspire everyone!"

<b>

Ryder reached out for a handshake, and Suzy responded.

<b>

"Y-yes... I'll do my best!"

"So, what are you good at? I've heard you can handle a sword..."

"Ah... yes... I use two swords... the one I'm most used to..."

"Two swords?"

"Ah... I hold one in each hand!"

"Oh! A dual-wielder! Then you should choose something easy to use from that sword rack over there."

<b>

When she looked where Ryder pointed, there were several boxes lined up against the wall, with swords stuck in them haphazardly.

<b>

(It's like a stand for umbrellas. Oh, I remember seeing a kendo club's room where bamboo swords were stuck like this.)

<b>

On the right were wooden swords, and on the left were blunted iron ones.

<b>

(Are the wooden swords for younger kids? Using the blunted ones is pretty practical, huh?)

Thinking this, she picked out a sword that looked easy to handle from the leftmost box.

<b>

"Oh, that's for practice swings..."

<b>

Ryder, who had been watching, was about to say that only heavier ones for practice swings were there...

<b>

But Suzy effortlessly pulled out two swords from the box with her fingertips.

<b>

She then began to juggle them, spinning each sword a few times before catching them, testing their weight.

<b>

After that, she swung both swords up and down a few times to check how they felt.

<b>

The sound of slicing through the air echoed.

<b>

"Wow! So fast!"

"That's amazing, Su-chan!"

"Really, to swing that fast, Su is incredible!"

"No! That's not just fast or amazing! Irvin! Did you see that?"

"Yeah! Three... no, four times! Four times she swung down!"

"Four times!? No way! Didn't she just lift and lower them once?!"

"That's not all, the trajectory was all the same. It didn't waver at all. I've never seen anything like that."

"Damn! Can I go first? Since I met her first, right?"

"Eh! Then I won't be last! ...Well, that's fine. Irvin, can you do it?"

"Of course! ...I want to do it!!"

"That's right! Go for it, Irvin! And then it's my turn!"

"Yeah! Big brother! I'm going first!"

<b>

Irvin told Ryder, stepping into the center.

<b>

"...Irvin has really grown into a man, hasn't he?"

"Vivi-chan, have you fallen for him again?"

"N-no! That's not it!!"

<b>

In the center, Ryder faced Suzy...

<b>

"I'm sorry, Suzy. That's for practice swings, and it has more weight than the others. If that hits, it won't be a joke. Can you choose from the box next to it?"

<b>

Suzy hurriedly began to select a blunted sword.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, Irvin, what about armor?"

"I don't need it."

"That was more than I heard. You'll lose a bone or two."

"Oh! If it's a bone, I can fix it right away! Don't worry about it!"

<b>

Jessica raised her hand, happily announcing.

<b>

"That's what she said."

"Hey! That's great!"

"Don't worry! ...I won't... ...leave it to me!!"

<b>

Suzy puffed her cheeks and huffed.

<b>

"That girl! Isn't she acting a bit too eager?!"

"She looks so confident."

<b>

In the center, Suzy and Irvin faced each other.

<b>

"Huh? Is one sword enough?"

"Yeah... for a match... this should... be fine..."

"I see, I'll rely on you."

"Yeah! ...Nice to meet you! ...Irvin!"

<b>

She replied with a big smile.

<b>

"Th-that's why... that smile is... not good..."

<b>

Suzy tilted her head in confusion.

Seeing that, Irvin turned red.

<b>

<b>

"Again! Irvin is getting all flustered!!"

"Vivi-chan, you can't be jealous, okay?"

"Th-that's not it!!"

<b>

<b>

Ryder approached Irvin.

<b>

"Irvin. Are you sure you want to do this?"

<b>

He asked coldly.

In such a cheerful state, it would be pointless. His voice seemed to say that.

<b>

"I'll do it! I'll do it!!"

<b>

Irvin slapped his cheeks repeatedly to pump himself up.

<b>

"Alright!! Let's do this, big brother!!"

"You're ready, right?"

"The Haggards never back down in front of an opponent! Right?!"

"That's right! Alright! Come at me!!"

"Yeah!!"

<b>

Ryder stood in the center, confirming with both of them before lowering his raised hand.

The signal to start!

<b>

<b>

Irvin's weapon was a longsword.

He charged forward, swinging it down from his right shoulder, closing the distance in a single leap.

He didn't hesitate to gauge his opponent's reaction.

Fully aware that he was the underdog, he charged in with the determination to land even a single blow.

<b>

In contrast, Suzy held her sword in her left hand, standing relaxed with both hands hanging loosely.

Her gaze was straight ahead, and her expression was very calm.

<b>

"Su's atmosphere has changed."

"Yeah, that's scary. I wouldn't dare to make a move."

<b>

Carla and Alicia exchanged such conversations.

<b>

"Huh? Really? To me, she just looks like she's standing there?"

"She has no openings. Even though she's just standing there, it feels like any attack would be countered, and there's nowhere to strike. Still! I would charge in too!"

<b>

Carla answered Colin's question without hesitation.

<b>

<b>

What Irvin was trying to do was just one thing.

To unleash his best strike at the fastest speed.

He swung down with all his weight from the right in a diagonal cut.

If it was blocked, he would follow through without losing momentum and slice upward!

<b>

The strike, powered by his own momentum and the twisting of his body, approached Suzy.

<b>

However, Suzy slightly swayed her body, and without receiving the blade with her sword, she struck the left side of Irvin's sword with the pommel.

<b>

The impact from being struck from the side was unexpectedly strong, and Irvin was jolted, losing his balance and stumbling forward.

<b>

With her body slightly turned, Suzy moved out of Irvin's path and stood next to his face.

<b>

From that position, she tapped her right finger against Irvin's temple, causing him to jerk back and fly toward the wall with incredible force.

<b>

"Gaahh!!?"

<b>

He crashed into the wall, the air being forced out of his lungs.

<b>

(My head hurts so much! What was that? What just happened!? Why did I fly away!?)

Struggling to rise, Irvin tried to assess the situation.

<b>

"Irvin, are you done?"

<b>

(What is he talking about? There's no way it's over!!)

<b>

"I can still go! One more time!"

"Alright! Get ready!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, Irvin was thrown to the ground four more times.

He was slashed, parried, and thrust at. All were evaded and countered.

<b>

"That's enough, Irvin."

"Wait, wait! ...I can still..."

"Switch out, take a break."

<b>

He tried to stand but his limbs wouldn't cooperate, and he collapsed flat on the ground.

<b>

"Haah! ...Haah! ...Haah! ...Haah! ..."

"Are you okay, Irvin?"

<b>

While trying to catch his breath, lying on his back, Beatrice approached him with concern.

<b>

"Damn it! Just... just a few exchanges, and... I didn't even... exchange blows... and look at this!"

"....Irvin."

"Seriously... that's insane... that's unfair."

"Right? That girl has insane magic power!"

"Damn it! With such a clear difference in strength..."

"There's no way we can just sit back and take that!" they all agreed.

<b>

They exchanged glances and couldn't help but laugh.

<b>

"What about you, Vivi?"

"Of course! When you see that much magic power, you can only be dumbfounded! ...But!"

"Anyone who sees that difference in strength and loses their fighting spirit doesn't belong in this village!"

"Rather, in Amukam village, you can't help but want to challenge it!"

"Exactly!"

<b>

Hahaha, they laughed together.

Mia, watching from afar, muttered, "Looks like Vivi-chan made up with her."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"You're amazing, Su! More than I imagined!"

<b>

Carla's weapon was a single-edged sword without a guard, about 30 centimeters long.

She kept it sheathed at her waist, twisting her arm behind her back, changing her trajectory erratically as she slid in low.

<b>

(Isn't that a dagger?! So she really is a stealthy person! Could it be that she's using a technique like the "Shifting Blade K-Slash"?)

<b>

Carla ran past Suzy, sliding her blade, but it was deflected by Suzy's sword.

The moment she was deflected, she jumped back to alleviate the intense impact, performing several backward flips in mid-air before landing on her feet.

<b>

"Wow, my hand is tingling from that impact..."

<b>

Shaking her hand that held the dagger, she regained her stance and lightly hopped in place.

<b>

"I'm going for real! I think I can connect with Su!"

<b>

Saying that, she charged toward Suzy again.

She swayed left and right once more.

But this time, it was even larger, more three-dimensional, and then...

<b>

"Phantom Quartet!"

<b>

Carla's figure split into four.

<b>

"Whoa! ...a shadow clone technique!?"

<b>

(I see, she's splitting her consciousness into multiple directions to come at me. This will be effective against someone who can read ki... So Carla can manipulate ki too. Compared to Irvin and Dana, her ki wrapped around her sword is quite solid. But! She's still not on Howard Papa's level!)

<b>

Four Carlas approached Suzy.

<b>

Just as the phantoms were about to make contact with Suzy, Carla's blade approached from behind her.

<b>

But just before the blade made contact, Suzy's sword, which had been wrapped around from below, intercepted it with the pommel.

<b>

Seeing the blade stopped without even looking, Carla froze for a moment.

That moment of hesitation caused the phantoms to disappear.

<b>

Suzy, still facing forward, slid her sword to brush aside Carla's dagger, pressing the flat of her blade against the hand holding the dagger.

<b>

Using that hand as a pivot, Suzy twisted her sword, lifting Carla's leg off the ground as she spun.

<b>

"Uh-oh!"

<b>

Carla's body spun, coming close to Suzy.

And just as Suzy's left elbow touched Carla's water moon...

<b>

"Kaahh!!"

<b>

Carla was blown away and crashed into the wall, collapsing to the floor.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Alicia was unarmed and wearing protective gear.

She had gloves, elbow pads, foot guards, shin guards, and knee pads, and was bouncing lightly in place.

<b>

(Is she a martial artist? The gloves look like those worn by karate practitioners... Oh? But she has something that looks like a knife at her waist. Could it be that after punching and kicking, she finishes with a knife, like some kind of commandos? Is she the most dangerous one?!)

<b>

"Alright! I'm the last one. Since we're dressed alike, it feels like a sister showdown, right?"

<b>

Alicia said cheerfully, but once it was clear she was a martial artist, she began to resemble some kind of martial arts master.

<b>

"Okay! Here I go!"

<b>

With the signal to start, Alicia launched her attack.

<b>

Starting with a left roundhouse kick, she transitioned to a right roundhouse kick, executing a series of elegant kicks like a dance.

<b>

However, Suzy easily evaded all of them.

<b>

Eventually, Alicia flipped her body, supporting herself with her hands in a handstand while spinning, using the momentum to launch a high-speed kick at Suzy. Whoa! A spinning kick!?

<b>

Suzy deflected Alicia's approaching leg with the back of her right hand.

Alicia used the momentum from being deflected to flow backward, spinning in the opposite direction to regain her stance and closed the distance again.

<b>

Alicia drew her knife, combining punches, kicks, elbows, and knees in a relentless barrage of high-speed attacks.

<b>

Just then, Suzy lightly tapped the floor with her heel while keeping her right toes down, sending a shockwave through the ground that nearly knocked Alicia off balance.

Seizing the opportunity, Suzy charged in.

Alicia instinctively raised her arms to guard.

<b>

Suzy gently placed her right palm on top of Alicia's guard... and Alicia's body was enveloped in a shockwave, sending her flying.

<b>

"Ugh! Was that 'Pierce'?! Gahh!!"

<b>

Alicia crashed into the wall, collapsing just like Carla.

<b>

<b>

"It seems you graduates didn't get much leniency compared to the two below you, huh?"

<b>

Jessica, having finished treating Carla, said with amusement.

<b>

"Haha, I don't know if I should be happy or frustrated..."

<b>

Carla, sitting against the wall, chuckled wryly.

<b>

"Ohhh, but I think I'm more frustrated! Just when I finally got to play with Su, and now I'm graduating!"

"You'll still be together during the summer, so that's good."

"That's true, but... ohhh! I wish I could have met her sooner!"

"Hehe, you sound like a spoiled child. Now, I need to check on Alicia! I hope she didn't break a rib or anything♪"

"Why do you look so happy? That's scary!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing the matches with the upperclassmen, Suzy also faced the underclassmen.

<b>

In one-on-one matches against a group, the children were doing their best to try and get a hit on Suzy.

Among them, Stephan and sixth grader Helena Slater showed quite a bit of effort.

<b>

Most of the kids lost their fighting spirit after just one encounter with Suzy's "Friendly Finger," but Stephan kept coming back for more, as he had received it many times before.

His movements seemed to have improved somewhat over the past week of training.

<b>

Helena had been the only one to express a negative attitude toward Suzy when she first enrolled.

<b>

"I won't acknowledge you!!"

<b>

This was on the second day of enrollment.

Suzy had felt a little hurt by the sudden rejection.

<b>

In the end, her attitude stemmed from jealousy over her admiration for Dana becoming infatuated with Suzy...

<b>

Now, the admired Dana was unable to land a hit, while she herself couldn't even touch Suzy.

With every deflection, the pain resonated through her body, and she stood up repeatedly with teary eyes.

<b>

Now, she could understand why Dana was so infatuated with this person...

Helena was also a daughter of Amukam.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work. It seems everyone got a good boost from this."

"Thank you... very much! ...It was fun!"

"That's great! If possible, I'd like to have a match with you too, but... it seems impossible today. Let's definitely arrange it soon!"

"Yes! ...Definitely! ...I'm looking forward to it!"

<b>

Suzy and Ryder exchanged a handshake and made a promise to spar.

<b>

"Um... can I ask you one thing?"

"What is it? Ask me anything I might know."

"Um... who is Ravi?"

<b>

Ryder's face suddenly stiffened.

<b>

"Oh... right, I... well..."

<b>

The image and voice of a girl he once knew well resurfaced in Ryder's mind.

<b>

"...I'm sorry, I... I can't answer that... Please forgive me..."

<b>

Ryder clutched his chest, his expression twisting as if enduring pain.

Suzy could only quietly watch Ryder's figure.
