# Episode 26: Suzy Cloud's Match

"Su, you should come to the training ground today."

<b>

It was suddenly said by Carla during lunch.

<b>

"Well, we graduate tomorrow. We'll still be here during the summer, but today is the only day we can practice together at school, right?"

<b>

Last week, we completed contracts for all attributes over five days.

Yesterday, under the guidance of the priest, we conducted trials for each attribute.

<b>

Is it a milestone in studying magic?

<b>

Suzy thought while chewing on a thick roast beef clubhouse sandwich. Ah, the combination of beef and mustard brings happiness flowing in...

<b>

"It's not like it's the last memory or anything... what do you think?"

<b>

In fact, Suzy's skill in holding back had improved over the past few days from sparring with Stefan.

By softly wrapping her "ki," she had gained confidence in her ability to move without injuring her opponent.

<b>

She named it "Friendly Finger."

With this, I don't think I'll accidentally hurt my opponent! she thought, snorting inwardly.

<b>

"Okay... I understand... I'll go... today!"

"Really!? Yayyy! Su! I'm so happyyy!!"

<b>

For some reason, Dana hugged her.

<b>

"Mogimyu!"

"Huh? Su-chan is going? Then I have to go too! Yes! I have to watch over you properly!"

"You're totally Su's guardian now, huh?"

"If that's the case, I might as well go watch too."

"Huh? Everyone's going? Then I'll go too. Vivi, aren't you coming?"

"I-I'm going! I have to anyway! I'm going! Right, Algernon!"

<b>

Kikikyu! replied the rodent.

It seems all the girls are going to the training ground today.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Huh? Suzy is coming here today? Yayyy!!"

<b>

Irvin approached Suzy, who was heading to the training ground, looking unusually happy.

<b>

"Irvin? I think you're a bit too close!"

"Huh? Vivi? Why are you here too?"

"Am I not allowed to go!?"

"N-No! It's not that! I just thought it was unusual..."

"Don't worry, Irvin! I'll guide you!"

"Wha! Dana! W-Wait!!"

<b>

Irvin hurriedly chased after Suzy, who was being taken away by the girls.

<b>

<b>

The training ground was like a log cabin, a small gym about 20 meters on each side.

The floor was just packed earth, resembling a large sumo practice area, Suzy thought.

<b>

"We'll change, but... Su, you don't have a change of clothes, do you?"

<b>

Carla asked her.

<b>

(Change of clothes? Something like gym clothes? Hmm, what should I do? I didn't bring any... I don't want to get my clothes dirty, but I guess as long as I don't sit on the ground, it should be fine?)

<b>

"I don't have... a change... but... I'll be fine... like this!"

"No way! You'll get dirty! I'll lend you mine!"

<b>

Alicia said. "Huh? Won't it be too big for me?" Suzy replied.

<b>

"Don't worry, don't worry! Come on! I'll help you change!"

<b>

She cheerfully pulled Suzy to the changing room.

<b>

<b>

The clothes she was made to wear were a white sleeveless T-shirt and light yellow wide pants.

The T-shirt was a bit big and looked like it might slip off her shoulders.

The pants were folded multiple times to adjust the length.

<b>

"See! It's fine, right? Look! You look pretty cute!"

<b>

Alicia proudly pushed her in front of the other girls.

<b>

"I see! It really changes your image... Looks like we know what to do this summer!"

<b>

Suzy felt a bit of dread from the giggling older girls.

<b>

<b>

In the end, she ended up in matching outfits with Alicia.

<b>

"Hehe, we look like sisters, right? Right?!"

<b>

Alicia said, wrapping her arm around Suzy and rubbing her cheek against hers.

<b>

"Ah! That's so unfair!"

<b>

Carla exclaimed. And Carla's outfit was...

<b>

<b>

(Huh? Carla, that black outfit looks like a ninja costume, doesn't it? It's shorts, but it only looks like a ninja! Even has a forehead protector! Is she a stealthy person? Don't ask for a name, huh??!)

<b>

Suzy felt a bit taken aback by the strange cultural mix.

<b>

After changing, when she came out of the changing room, the kids had already gathered, and the village adults responsible for guidance had entered the training ground.

<b>

The village adults took turns guiding the children at the training ground.

<b>

Today, it was Ryder Haggard.

He was Irvin's older brother.

<b>

Ryder was 24 this year and had served four years in the knight's order in the royal capital until last year.

<b>

Looking over the children in the training ground, Ryder spotted Suzy, whom he had never seen before...

<b>

"...Huh? Ravi? ...Ravi! ...No way..."

<b>

His eyes widened in surprise, and he gasped.

The lively figure of a girl overlapped with Suzy in Ryder's eyes.

<b>

"Big brother! This is Suzy, from Cloud's place! She's going to train here today!"

<b>

Ryder snapped back to reality at Irvin's words.

<b>

"I-I see! ...Right... So you are Suzy! I've heard about you. I hope you can inspire everyone!"

<b>

Ryder reached out for a handshake, and Suzy responded.

<b>

"Y-Yes... I'll do my best!"

"What are you good at? I've heard you can handle a sword..."

"Ah... yes... I use... two swords... I'm most... accustomed to that..."

"Two swords?"

"Ah... I hold... one in each hand!"

"Oh! A dual-wielder! Then you should choose something easy to use from that sword rack over there."

<b>

When Suzy looked in the direction Ryder pointed, she saw several boxes lined up against the wall, with swords haphazardly stuck in them.

<b>

(That looks like a stand for umbrellas. Oh, I remember seeing a kendo club's room with bamboo swords stuck like this.)

<b>

On the right side were wooden swords, and on the left were blunted iron ones.

<b>

(A wooden sword is probably for younger kids? Using a blunted one is quite practical, isn't it?)

<b>

Thinking this, she picked out a sword that looked easy to handle from the leftmost box.

<b>

"Ah, that's for practice swings..."

<b>

Ryder, who had been watching, was about to say that only heavier ones for practice swings were in that box...

<b>

But Suzy effortlessly pulled out two swords with her fingertips, juggling them a few times to test their weight.

<b>

Just like juggling, he spun the swords in each hand several times, catching them and testing their weight.

<b>

Then, she swung both swords up and down a few times to check their balance.

<b>

The sound of slicing through the air echoed.

<b>

"Wow! So fast!"

"That's amazing, Su-chan!"

"Really, to swing that fast, Su is incredible!"

"No way! That's not just fast or amazing! Irvin! Did you see that?"

"Yeah! Three... no, four times! She swung down four times!"

"Four times!? No way! Didn't she just lift and lower them once?!"

"Not just that, her blade trajectory was all the same. Not a single wobble. I've never seen anything like that."

"Damn! Can I go first? Since it's in the order we met?"

"Eh! Then I won't be last! ...Well, fine. Irvin, can you do it?"

"Of course! ...I want to do it!!"

"That's right! Go for it, Irvin! And then it's my turn!"

"Yeah! Big brother! I'm going first!"

<b>

Irvin told Ryder and stepped into the center.

<b>

"...Irvin has really grown into a man, hasn't he?"

"Vivi, have you fallen for him again?"

"N-No! That's not it!!"

<b>

In the center of the training ground, Ryder faced Suzy.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Suzy. That's for practice swings, and it's heavier than the others. If that hits you, it won't be a joke. Can you choose from the box next to it?"

<b>

Suzy hurriedly began to choose a blunted sword instead.

<b>

<b>

"Irvin, what about armor?"

"I don't need it."

"That was more than I heard. You could lose a bone or two."

"Oh! If it's a bone, I'll fix it right away! Don't worry about it!"

<b>

Jessica raised her hand and said cheerfully.

<b>

"That's what she said."

"Well! That's fine!"

"Don't worry! ...I won't... ...leave it to me!!"

<b>

Suzy clenched her fist and snorted.

<b>

"Is that girl acting a bit too eager?!"

"She looks really confident."

<b>

In the center, Suzy and Irvin faced each other.

<b>

"Huh? Is one sword enough?"

"Yeah... for sparring... this should... be fine..."

"Okay, I'll rely on you."

"Yeah! ...Nice to meet you! ...Irvin!"

<b>

She replied with a big smile.

<b>

"Th-That smile... is bad..."

<b>

Suzy tilted her head slightly.

Seeing that, Irvin's face turned red.

<b>

<b>

"Again! Irvin is getting all flustered!!"

"Vivi, don't get jealous, okay?"

"Th-That's not it!!"

<b>

<b>

Ryder approached Irvin.

<b>

"Irvin. Are you sure you want to do this?"

<b>

He asked in a cold voice.

In such a cheerful state, it would be pointless. His tone conveyed that.

<b>

"I will! I will do it!!"

<b>

Irvin slapped his cheeks several times to pump himself up.

<b>

"Alright!! I'm ready, big brother!!"

"You're sure you can do it?"

"The Haggard men never back down in front of an opponent! Right?"

"That's right! Alright! Come at me with your best shot!!"

"Yeah!!"

<b>

Ryder stood in the center, confirmed with the two of them, and lowered his raised hand.

The signal to start!

<b>

<b>

Irvin's weapon was a longsword.

He charged forward, shouldering it, closing the distance in a single leap.

He didn't hesitate to gauge his opponent's reaction.

He recognized he was the underdog and charged in with the resolve to land even a single hit.

<b>

Suzy, on the other hand, held her sword in her left hand, arms relaxed, standing calmly.

Her gaze was straight ahead, and her expression was very peaceful.

<b>

"Su's aura has changed."

"Yeah, that's scary. I wouldn't dare to make a move."

<b>

Carla and Alicia exchanged such comments.

<b>

"Huh? Is that so? To me, she just looks like she's standing still?"

"There's no opening. Even though she's just standing there, it feels like no matter where I strike, it'll be countered. Still! I would charge in!"

<b>

Carla answered Colin's question without hesitation.

<b>

<b>

What Irvin was trying to do was simple.

He just needed to unleash his best strike as fast as possible.

He swung down his sword from the right, putting his weight into it.

If it was blocked, he would continue the momentum and slice upward from below!

<b>

His thrust, propelled by his own momentum and the twisting of his body, rushed toward Suzy.

<b>

However, Suzy slightly shifted her body, and without receiving the blade, she struck the left side of Irvin's sword with the pommel of her own.

<b>

The impact from being struck from the side was surprisingly strong, causing Irvin to lose his balance and stumble forward.

<b>

With her body angled, Suzy moved out of Irvin's path and stood next to his face.

<b>

From that position, she tapped her right finger against Irvin's temple, flicking it lightly, sending him flying toward the wall with incredible force.

<b>

"Gahhh!!?"

<b>

He crashed into the wall, the air forced out of his lungs.

<b>

(My head hurts like hell! What the hell? What just happened!? Why did I get blown away!?)

<b>

Struggling to get up, Irvin tried to assess the situation.

<b>

"Irvin, are you done?"

<b>

(What is he saying? There's no way it can be over!!)

<b>

"I'm still good! One more time!"

"Alright! Get ready!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, Irvin was thrown to the ground four more times.

Slashes, parries, thrusts. All were dodged and countered.

<b>

"Irvin, that's enough."

"Wait, wait! ...I can still..."

"It's time to switch. Rest."

<b>

He tried to stand up, but his limbs wouldn't cooperate, and he collapsed flat on his back.

<b>

"Ha! ...Ha! ...Ha! ...Ha! ..."

"Are you okay, Irvin?"

<b>

As he lay on his back, breathing heavily to recover his stamina, Beatrice asked with concern.

<b>

"Damn it! Just... just a few exchanges, and... I didn't even... get to exchange blows..."

"....Irvin."

"Seriously... that's insane... that's totally unfair."

"Yeah, that kid's magic power is ridiculous!"

"Damn it! After seeing such a gap in strength..."

"There's no way we can't get fired up!"

<b>

They exchanged glances and couldn't help but laugh.

<b>

"What? Vivi too?"

"Of course! After seeing that kind of magic power, all I can do is be amazed! ...But!"

"Anyone who gets demotivated after seeing such a gap in strength isn't in this village!"

"Rather, it's the kind of village where you can't help but want to challenge!"

"Exactly!"

<b>

Hahaha, heehee, the two laughed together.

Over there, Mia murmured, "Looks like Vivi made up with her."

<b>

<b>

"Finally, we can do this, Su!"

"Mm! ...Dana... are you... going to do that?"

<b>

(It's about my height. I thought it was a staff, but is it a spear? A short spear? Since it's short, will it be used like a staff? Dana's outfit looks kind of like a Chinese dress... no, it has pants, so maybe it's an ao dai?)

<b>

"Yes! A spear! I'm not that skilled either, so I'll go all out!"

<b>

With the signal to start, Dana dashed forward.

She spun the spear behind her back, adding centrifugal force and speed, then swung it from the right in a sweeping motion.

<b>

However, Suzy deflected it upward with her short sword.

The spear was sent flying upward with the momentum, and Dana's arm was pulled along with it, raising her side.

<b>

By the time Dana realized, Suzy's fingertips were already touching her side.

<b>

"Gyahh!!"

<b>

She was blown against the wall and rolled down.

<b>

<b>

"Ugh... this is... definitely tough... but!"

<b>

Dana held her side, a pained expression on her face, but she managed to sit up and glared at the center.

<b>

"I'm not done yet! I can still go!!"

<b>

Holding the spear in the middle, she charged toward Suzy, spinning it in an eight shape in front of her.

But even with the spear tips approaching at high speed from both sides, she couldn't catch Suzy.

<b>

Dana circled around Suzy, launching a series of thrusts and sweeps randomly.

<b>

However, all of them were dodged and deflected.

Occasionally, the weight of the spear would almost pull her off balance, but she managed to keep it from losing momentum and added it to her next attack.

<b>

The spear tip was thrust toward Suzy's face.

Suzy tilted her head to the right to dodge it and struck the returning spear with the pommel of her sword.

Unable to control the unexpected force of the returning spear, Dana's body leaned back.

<b>

Suzy slipped into her guard and gently placed her fingertips on Dana's chest.

<b>

"Gyab!"

<b>

Dana was blown back against the wall again.

<b>

"Ah! ...Cough... cough! ...Hah!"

<b>

She struggled to catch her breath after having the air squeezed out of her lungs.

Using the spear for support, she stood up again...

<b>

"One more time!!"

<b>

Dana charged at Suzy again.

<b>

<b>

In the end, Dana was knocked down five times.

<b>

"Good job."

"Ha! ...Ha! ...Ha! ..."

<b>

Colin quietly spoke to Dana, who was leaning against the wall, sitting on the ground while clinging to her spear.

<b>

"How was it? Just as you expected?"

"Ha! ...Ha... yes! ...Even better than I expected... ha! ...what an incredible... kid."

"I've never seen Dana so helpless before."

"Ha... the level is... different... I told you, right? ...She's a master!"

"Fufu, you seem happy."

"Hehe... of course I'm happy! ...Such an amazing... amazing kid is so close! Every day is exciting! Plus... she's super cute! ...I'm totally in love with Su!"

"I know! I'm in love with Su too! Hehe."

<b>

Ahaha, uhuhu, Dana and Colin laughed together.

Watching them, Mia puffed her cheeks, thinking, "I'm more in love!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Just as expected, Su. You're beyond my imagination!"

<b>

Carla's weapon was a single-edged sword without a guard, about 30 centimeters long.

<b>

She kept it in her waist sheath while twisting her arm behind her back, changing her trajectory erratically, sliding in low.

<b>

(Isn't that a dagger?! So she really is a stealthy person! Could it be that she's using a technique like 'Shifting Blade K'?!)

<b>

Carla ran past Suzy, sliding her blade, but it was deflected by Suzy's sword.

As she was deflected, she jumped back, spinning in the air a few times before landing on her feet.

<b>

"Wow, my hand is tingling from that impact..."

<b>

She shook her hand, which was holding the dagger, and regained her posture, lightly bouncing in place.

<b>

"I'm going for real! I think I can take you on, Su!"

<b>

Saying that, she ran toward Suzy again.

She swayed left and right once more.

But this time, it was even bigger, more three-dimensional, and then...

<b>

"Phantom Quartet!"

<b>

Carla's figure split into four.

<b>

"Whoa! ...Shadow Clone Technique!?"

<b>

(I see, she's splitting her consciousness into multiple actions to come at me. The more I can read her presence, the more effective it is... So Carla can manipulate 'ki' too. Compared to Irvin and Dana, her 'ki' wrapped around the sword is quite solid. But! She's still not on Howard Papa's level!)

<b>

The four Carlas approached Suzy.

<b>

Just as the phantoms were about to make contact with Suzy, Carla's blade approached from behind her.

<b>

But just before the blade could hit, Suzy's sword edge, which had been wrapped around her back, intercepted it.

<b>

Seeing her thrust from a blind spot stopped without even looking, Carla froze for a moment.

That moment of hesitation caused the phantoms to vanish.

<b>

Suzy, still facing away, slid her sword to brush Carla's blade aside and pressed the blade's belly against Carla's hand holding the dagger.

<b>

Using that hand's position as a pivot, Suzy spun her sword, lifting Carla's leg off the ground.

<b>

"Uh-oh!"

<b>

Carla's body spun, coming into close contact with Suzy.

And just as Suzy's left elbow touched Carla's water moon point...

<b>

"Ughhh!!"

<b>

Carla was blown back and crashed into the wall, collapsing to the floor.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Alicia was unarmed and wearing protective gear.

She had gloves, elbow and knee pads, shin guards, and thick support pads, lightly bouncing in place.

<b>

(Is it martial arts? The gloves look like something a karate practitioner would wear... Oh? But she has something like a knife at her waist. Could it be that after punching and kicking, she finishes with a knife? Is she the most dangerous one??)

<b>

"Alright! I'm the last one! Since we're in matching outfits, it feels like a sister duel, right?"

<b>

Alicia said cheerfully, but realizing she was a martial artist made her look like some kind of martial arts sage.

<b>

"Okay! Here I go!"

<b>

With the signal to start, Alicia began her attack.

<b>

She started with a left roundhouse kick, transitioning into a right roundhouse kick, executing a series of elegant kicks like a dance.

<b>

However, Suzy easily dodged all of them.

<b>

Eventually, Alicia flipped her body, supporting herself with her hands in a handstand while spinning, using the centrifugal force of her legs to launch a rapid kick at Suzy. Whoa! A spinning kick!?

<b>

Suzy deflected Alicia's approaching leg with the back of her right hand.

Alicia used the momentum of being deflected to flow backward, spinning in the opposite direction to regain her stance, then kicked off the ground to close the distance again.

<b>

Alicia drew her knife from her waist, combining punches, kicks, elbows, and knees in a relentless series of high-speed attacks.

<b>

Just then, Suzy lightly tapped the floor with her heel while keeping her right toes on the ground, sending a shockwave through the floor that nearly knocked Alicia off balance.

Immediately, Suzy closed in.

Alicia instinctively raised her arms to guard.

<b>

Suzy gently placed her right palm on top of Alicia's guard... and Alicia's body was engulfed in shock, sending her flying.

<b>

"Guhh! Is that 'Pierce'!? Gahh!!"

<b>

Alicia crashed into the wall and collapsed to the floor, just like Carla.

<b>

<b>

"It seems you graduates didn't get much leeway compared to the two below you."

<b>

Jessica, who had finished treating Carla, said with amusement.

<b>

"Haha, I don't know whether to be happy or frustrated..."

<b>

Carla said with a wry smile while sitting on the floor against the wall.

<b>

"Ahh, but I think I'm more frustrated! Just when I finally got to play with Su, and now I'm graduating!"

"Well, you'll still be together during the summer, so that's good."

"That's true, but... ahh, I wish I could have met her sooner!"

"Fufu, you sound like a spoiled child. Now, I need to check on Alicia! I hope she didn't break a rib or anything♪"

"Why do you look so happy? That's scary!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing the matches with the upperclassmen, Suzy also faced the underclassmen.

<b>

In one-on-one matches against a group, the kids were doing their best to try to get a hit on Suzy.

<b>

Among them, Stefan and sixth grader Helena Slater showed considerable effort.

<b>

Most kids lost their fighting spirit after one hit from Suzy's "Friendly Finger," but Stefan kept challenging her, as he had experienced it many times.

His movements seemed to have improved somewhat over the past week.

<b>

Helena was the only one who had a negative attitude toward Suzy when she first enrolled.

<b>

"I will not acknowledge you!!"

<b>

That was on her second day of enrollment.

Suzy felt a bit hurt by the sudden denial.

<b>

<b>

In the end, her attitude stemmed from jealousy over her admiration for Dana becoming infatuated with Suzy...

<b>

Now, the admired Dana couldn't even touch Suzy, who was untouchable.

Each time she was deflected, the pain resonated through her body, and she stood up again with tears in her eyes.

<b>

Now, she felt she understood why Dana was so infatuated with this person...

Helena was also a daughter of Amukam.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work. It seems everyone got a good stimulus."

"Thank you... very much! ...It was... fun!"

"That's great! If possible, I'd like to ask for a match too, but... it seems impossible today. Let's definitely arrange it soon!"

"Yes! ...Absolutely! ...Thank you... very much!"

<b>

Suzy and Ryder shook hands, exchanging promises for a future match.

<b>

"Um... can I ask you one thing?"

"What is it? Ask me anything I can answer."

"Um... who is Ravi?"

<b>

Ryder's face suddenly stiffened.

<b>

"Ah... right, I... well..."

<b>

The image and voice of a girl he once knew well resurfaced in Ryder's mind.

<b>

"...I'm sorry... I can't... I can't answer that... Please forgive me..."

<b>

Ryder clutched his chest, his expression twisting as he endured the pain.

Suzy could only quietly watch Ryder's figure.
