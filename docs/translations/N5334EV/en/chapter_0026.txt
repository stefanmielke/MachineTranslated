# 26 - Suzy Cloud stands in.

Sue. Come to the training ground today."

<blank>

At lunch, Kara told me abruptly.

<blank>

I'll still be here for the summer, but it's the only day we can do hand-to-hand combat at school, right? I'll still be here for the summer, but we can only have our hand-to-hand combat at school today, right?"

<blank>

Last week we took five days to complete the contract for all the attributes.

Yesterday, at the beginning of the week, under the guidance of a priest, we conducted a trial of each of the attributes.

<blank>

Is it a break in the magic study?

<blank>

Suzy was thinking as she munched on a clubhouse sandwich made with thick roast beef.　Ah, the combination of beef and mustard makes my happiness flow in....

<blank>

Not that it's my last memory, but how about ......?"

<blank>

As a matter of fact, Suzy's skill at holding back had improved after dealing with Stefan for the past few days.

By softly clad in "Ki", he has gained confidence in his ability to stand without injuring his opponents.

<blank>

Named "Friendly Fingers".

I don't think this will hurt them by mistake! I think this will not hurt them by mistake!

<blank>

Yes...okay...today...I'm going...today!

Really? Yay! I'm soooo happy! I'm so happy!

<blank>

And for some reason, Dana hugged me.

<blank>

Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

What?" Sue-chan, you're going? Then I have to go too! I have to watch her! I have to watch over you!

You're totally Sue's protector!"

Then I might as well go and see what's going on."

What?" You're all going? I'm going, too. Bibi, are you coming?"

Yes, let's go! I'm going anyway! I'm going! See? Algernon!

<blank>

Kikikyu! The rodent answers, "I'm sorry.

It looks like all the girls are going to the training center today.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What? Susie's coming over here today? Yay!

<blank>

Irving came up to Suzy on his way to the training ground looking very happy.

<blank>

Irving? I think you're a little too close!"

What? Bibi? Why is Bibi even here?"

I'm not allowed to go!"

No, no! No, it's not like that! I was just wondering if it was unusual..."

Don't worry, Irving! I'll show you the way!"

Dana! Dana! Hey, hey!

<blank>

Irving hurriedly chases after Suzy, who is surrounded by Dana and the other girls and taken away.

<blank>

<blank>

The training hall was made of logs like a log house, and looked like a small gymnasium about 20 meters on each side.

Suzy commented that the floor was just the same as the hardened ground, like a big sumo training ground.

<blank>

We'll change, but Sue, you don't have a change of clothes, do you?"

<blank>

Carla asked.

<blank>

(Change of clothes? Like gym clothes? I don't want to get my clothes dirty, but as long as I don't get my butt on the ground or anything?)

<blank>

No change... but... I'm... going... to... life... as... well... as... it... is... as... it... is!

No, no, no! You'll get it dirty. I'll lend you mine!"

<blank>

Alicia came to me and said.　Huh? I guess it's not the right size.　Suzy said.

<blank>

Daijobu, Daijobu! Come here! Let me get you dressed!"

<blank>

He happily pulled Suzy into the changing room.

<blank>

<blank>

The clothes I was given were a white sleeveless T-shirt and light yellow wide pants.

The T-shirt is a little big, almost too big on the shoulders.

The pants are hemmed together with multiple folds.

<blank>

I'm sure you'll be fine! You're okay, right? Look! You're so cute!"

<blank>

Alicia proudly pushed her way in front of the other girls.

<blank>

I see! I see...the image will change.... I guess we've decided what we're going to do this summer!"

<blank>

Suzy felt a slight shiver when she saw the ladies laughing at her.

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, Alicia and I ended up wearing matching outfits.

<blank>

'Huh, we're like sisters, aren't we? Hey!"

<blank>

Alicia hugs my shoulder and rubs her cheek against me.

<blank>

Oh! That's zoolooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

and Kara. The guise of this Kara is....

<blank>

<blank>

(Huh? Kara-san, is that black costume different from a ninja costume? You're wearing shorts, but you look like a ninja. You even put on a forehead patch! You're a ninja, aren't you? Don't ask me what his name is! Are you a ninja?)

<blank>

I thought it was a strange mix of different cultures. Suzy was a bit taken back.

<blank>

When I finished dressing and came out of the changing room, the children had already finished gathering and the adults from the village who were assigned to teach them had also entered the training hall.

<blank>

At the training center, village adults take turns teaching.

<blank>

Ryder Haggard is here today.

He is one of Irving's older brothers.

<blank>

Ryder is 24 years old this year, and until last year, he served four years in a military role in the Knights of the King's Landing, a very talented group.

<blank>

Rider looked around at the children in the training hall and saw Suzy, whom he had never seen before, .......

<blank>

I'm going to go to "...... what? Ravi? ...Ravi! ...... na."

<blank>

I opened my eyes wide and gulped.

The image of a vivacious girl overlaps with Suzy in the eyes of the rider.

<blank>

Anita: "Anita, it's Suzy! It's Suzy, from Mr. Cloud's place! She's training over here today!"

<blank>

Irving's words brought me back to myself.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I didn't know you were a Suzy! ...I know...right...you're, you're Suzy, right? I hear you. I hope you're an inspiration to all of us!"

<blank>

Suzy is asked to shake hands with the rider, to which she responds.

<blank>

I'll do my best!

So, what are you good at? I've heard you can handle a sword..."

I'm the one who uses it the most.

"Nito?"

One...at...a...time...with...each...one...of...them!

Oh! You're a two-sword user! Well, then, you should choose one of those sword stands over there that's easy to use."

<blank>

When I looked in the direction Ryder pointed, I saw several boxes on the wall with swords randomly propped up in them.

<blank>

(It looks like an umbrella stand. Oh, I saw a kendo club room once where shinai (bamboo swords) were stuck like this.

<blank>

A wooden sword was held up on the right side, and an iron object with a drawn blade was held up on the left side.

<blank>

(Is the wooden sword for younger children? (Is it practical to have them use a wooden sword with a drawn blade?)

<blank>

I looked through the left-most box to find a length that would be easy to use.

<blank>

Oh, that's just pretending. ......

<blank>

The rider who was watching him tried to tell him that there was only a heavier weight for swinging....

<blank>

Susie lightly pulled the two swords out of the box with a swoosh of her fingertips.

<blank>

As if juggling, he spun the sword from side to side several times to check its weight.

<blank>

He then swung both swords up and down several times as if to check the swing.

<blank>

The sound of the wind rushing through the air! and the sound of the wind cutting through the air.

<blank>

Wow! Haya!"

That's great, Suu-chan.

I can't believe she can swing that fast.

No. That's not fast or great! That thing is not fast or great! Irving! Did you see that?"

"Oh! Three...no, four times, he's swung down four times!"

Four times! Bullshit! I thought you only raised and lowered it once!"

Not only that," he said, "the sword is all the same. "Not only that, but the sword is all in the same line. I've never seen anything like that before.

Chick-show! What's up? Can I go first? First to go, in that order?"

Yes! Then I'm not the last! ...... Well, that's okay. Irving, can you do it?"

I can do it, I can do it, I can do it! I wanna do ......!"

I'm sure you're right! Go ahead, Irving! And now it's my turn!

Oh! Big brother! I'll go first!

<blank>

After telling Ryder this, Irving proceeds to the center.

<blank>

I don't know, Irving, you've got a man's face now!

Vivi, are you falling in love with me all over again?"

Chi! Chi! It's not like that!

<blank>

In the center of the training hall, the rider turns to Suzy....

<blank>

I'm sorry, Susie. It's for swinging and has more weight than the other ones. If it hits you, you'll be in big trouble. Can you pick another one from the box next to it?"

<blank>

Huh! and Suzy hurriedly begins to re-select the blade-drawing sword.

<blank>

<blank>

Where's Irving's armor?"

I don't want it."

That was more than I had heard. You're going to lose a bone or two."

Oh! If it's bones, I'll take over immediately! Don't worry, I'll take over!"

<blank>

Jessica raised her hand and happily announced.

<blank>

That's right.

Dear! I'm good!"

I'm fine! ... I'm not here..! I'll take care of it!

<blank>

I'm not sure I want to do this! and Suzy holds her hand and lets out a snort.

<blank>

She's kind of acting like she's on a mission! She's acting all weird!"

You've got a confident look on your face.

<blank>

Suzy and Irvin face each other in the center.

<blank>

'Huh? Just one one-handed sword?"

"Well... if it's a combination... this... is... good... for me."

Well, good luck with that.

Yeah! Nice to meet you! Irving!

<blank>

He replies to Irving with a big smile.

<blank>

"! So..., that smile... is bad. ......"

<blank>

Hmm? Suzy tilts her head.

Irving sees this and turns red as he looks at it.

<blank>

<blank>

And again! Irving, you're growing a nose!"

Don't be jealous, Vivi, okay?"

So! That's why! That's not what I said!

<blank>

<blank>

Ryder approaches Irving.

<blank>

Irving. Should I stop?"

<blank>

He asked Irving in a cold voice.

It is useless from the end in such a floating state. That's what that voice says.

<blank>

I will do it! I'll do it!

<blank>

Irving slapped himself repeatedly on the cheek to get into the swing of things.

<blank>

I'm going to go to the gym and try to get some sleep! Way to go, Aniki!"

You can do this, right?"

A man in Haggard would never back down in the face of an opponent! You know that!"

That's right! All right! Come and borrow my chest!

Oh!

<blank>

The rider stands in the center of the room, gives them both a visual confirmation, and lowers his high raised hand.

Start! is the signal.

<blank>

<blank>

Irving's weapon of choice is a longsword.

He jumps out of the way as if carrying it on his right shoulder and closes the gap with a single step.

We don't try to see what the other side will do.

He is aware that he is a lower-ranked player and is ready to take the plunge, even if it means taking a sword.

<blank>

Suzy, on the other hand, holds her sword in her left hand and stands with her hands hanging slack-jawed and lolling.

His gaze is straight ahead and his expression is very calm.

<blank>

Sue's vibe has changed."

"Yeah, that's scary. I wouldn't touch that if I were you."

<blank>

Kara and Alicia have such a conversation.

<blank>

What?" Is that so? It just looks like you're standing there to me?"

There's no gap. I'm just standing there and there's no place to catch it because no matter where I hit it, it's going to be returned. Still! I'd go in there, too!"

<blank>

Carla answered Colin's question in a carefree manner.

<blank>

<blank>

Irving is trying to do only one thing.

You just have to deliver the best blow you have at the fastest speed.

The sword is swung down in a kesa shape with a weighted blow from the right side.

If you can catch it, don't kill the momentum, wind it up and cut it up from below!

<blank>

The blow released from the force of his own rush and the momentum of releasing his twisted body is right in front of Suzy's eyes.

<blank>

But Suzy shook herself slightly and struck the left side of Irving's sword with its hilt, without taking it on the sword's blade.

<blank>

The impact of being struck from the side with the sword was unexpectedly large, and Irving was shaken to his torso, causing him to fall forward and stomp his foot on his foot bellows.

<blank>

Half-open, Susie moved out of Irving's direction of travel and stood next to Irving's face.

<blank>

From that position, he placed his right finger on Irving's temple and popped it with a thump. Irving's face was thrown back and he was sent flying to the wall at a tremendous speed.

<blank>

Gah hah!!!?"

<blank>

His back slams into the wall and the air in his lungs is squeezed out.

<blank>

（My head hurts so much! What is this? What happened? Why did I get blown up?　(What the hell happened?)

<blank>

Irving finally rises to his feet and tries to check the situation.

<blank>

Irving, are you finished?"

<blank>

（What are you talking about? What are you talking about? It's not over!)

<blank>

I can still do it! One more!"

"Okay! Ready!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, Irving ended up hitting his back on the ground four times after that.

Cutting up, clearing, and stabbing. They were all dodged and passed over.

<blank>

Irving, that's enough.

Well, not yet! ...can ......"

Take your shift. Get some rest.

<blank>

He tried to stand up, but his limbs would not listen to him and he fell down to the ground in a heap.

<blank>

Ha! ...... Ha! ...... ha! ...... ha! ......"

Irving, are you okay?"

<blank>

As I lay on my back, breathing heavily and trying to regain my strength, Beatrice approached me with concern.

<blank>

'Damn! Just... just a few rounds, just a few rounds of hitting each other... or ...... hitting each other... or ...... this is how it is!"

...... Irving."

"Totally ...... ridiculous... that's a foul!"

Yeah, she's full of magic and bullshit!"

'Damn it! ......I've seen the difference in power. ......"

I can't not burn!" I know!"

<blank>

They look at each other and can't help laughing.

<blank>

What the hell, Bibi too?"

That's right! You can't help but be stunned when you're shown that much magic! Even ......!"

There is no one in this village who would lose their nerve after being shown the difference in power!

It's rather like the village of Amkam where you can't help but be challenged!"

That's right!"

<blank>

They laugh at each other.

Over there, Mia is muttering, "Bibi, you made up.

<blank>

<blank>

I can finally do it! Sue!"

"Nn...! Dana... is that... a spear?

<blank>

（It's only about my height. I thought it was a club, but is it a spear? Is it a short spear? (I thought it was a spear, but it's a spear? Dana's outfit looks like a Chinese dress...or maybe an ao dai since she has pants...)

<blank>

Spear! Spear! I'm not very dexterous either. I'll go at once!"

<blank>

The first one! Dana jumped out with the signal "Start!

The spearhead, with more centrifugal force and speed, swings out from the right, as if to reap a cleave.

<blank>

But Suzy leapt it up from below with a short sword.

The centrifugal force of the spear bounces upward, taking the arm along with it, and Dana's side is raised.

<blank>

By the time Dana realized it, Suzy's fingertips were already touching Dana's side.

<blank>

Geez!"

<blank>

Dana is blown up to the wall and rolls over.

<blank>

<blank>

"Wow, ......, this... sure is a tough one, even for ......!"

<blank>

Dana held her sides, raised her body in anguish, and looked at the center with a snap.

<blank>

I'm not done yet! I can go!

<blank>

Holding the midpoint of the spear, he turns it in a figure of eight in front of his body and lunges at Suzy.

However, even the spear tip, which approaches at high speed from both sides, cannot catch Suzy.

<blank>

Dana continues to circle around Suzy, and then she launches a series of random thrusts and dispersals.

<blank>

However, it is always lost and dealt with.

Occasionally, the weight of the spear is about to take it away, but he finally manages to pull it back and add it to the next attack without killing it.

<blank>

The tip of the spear was thrust into his face.

Suzy ducked the blow by tilting her head to the right and struck the spearhead that was being drawn back with the sword's hilt.

Unable to restrain the spear, which came back with unexpected force, Dana's body was thrown back.

<blank>

Suzy reaches into her bosom and places her fingertips softly on Dana's chest.

<blank>

Gee whiz!"

<blank>

Dana was blown up and slammed into the wall again.

<blank>

Oh..! ...... Kaka...Kahaha! ...... haag!"

<blank>

The air was squeezed out of my lungs and I could barely catch my choked breath.

Rise up again, using the spear as a support. ......

<blank>

One more!

<blank>

Dana rushes toward Suzy three times.

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, Dana was also struck down five times for convenience.

<blank>

Good work.

Hah! ...Hah! ......, hah..."

<blank>

Colin quietly called out to Dana, who was sitting on the ground, leaning her body against the wall and clinging to her spear.

<blank>

"How's it going? Did it meet your expectations?"

Hah...hah...ah! It's ...... more than I expected...! ...... hah....hah..., he's a hell of a....boy."

I've never seen Dana so out of touch."

"Ha...dimension...different thing...ha...ha...I told you...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha...ha! I'm a ...... expert...!"

"Hmm, you look kind of happy."

Hehehe....umm...that's...nice to see you! ...Such a ...... amazing girl is so close to me! I'm excited every day! And she's so cute! I'm crazy about Sue!

I know! I'm crazy about Sue too! Hmph."

<blank>

Hahaha, ugh, Dana and Colin are laughing at each other.

Mia, who was watching this, said, "I'm more attracted to you than you are to me!　Mia's cheeks puffed out.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

You're a rock, Sue. You're even better than I imagined!"

<blank>

Kara's weapon of choice is a single-edged sword with a blade of about 30 cm in length and no brim.

<blank>

With it in its sheath at his waist, he turns his arm to hide it behind his back, changes its trajectory erratically to the left and right, and slides into the ground as if crawling.

<blank>

(Isn't that a dagger? I knew it was a ninja! If it is a shapeshifting dagger, is it a K-sumi-kiri?)

<blank>

Kara ran past Suzy's side and slid her blade through her, but her blade was repelled by Suzy's sword.

At the moment he is hit, he jumps backward to cushion the powerful impact, spinning backward several times in mid-air and landing on his arms and legs.

<blank>

"It's great, my hand is zinging..."

<blank>

He returned to his posture, swinging his hand that was holding the dagger durably, and with a thump and a light leap on the spot....

<blank>

I'm going for real! I think I can get through to Sue!"

<blank>

With that, he started running toward Suzy again.

Once again, it swings from side to side.

But this time, it is even bigger, more three-dimensional, and...

<blank>

The Phantom Quartet

<blank>

Kara's figure splits.

<blank>

"Whoa...! ...Bunshin... no jutsu?

<blank>

(I see, you are dividing the consciousness of action into several parts and directing them toward us. I wonder if this will be more effective if the opponent is able to read our presence.... I guess Kara can manipulate Ki as well. Compared to Irving and Dana, the Ki in her sword is much stronger. But...! (Still not as good as Howard Papa, though!)

<blank>

Four kalas close in on Suzy.

<blank>

At about the same time that the phantom makes contact with Suzy, Kara's blade approaches from behind Suzy.

<blank>

But just before the blade hit, the edge of Suzy's sword, which was turned from below to her back, caught it.

<blank>

Kara's eyes widen and she stops moving for a moment when she sees the tip of a knife strike from a blind spot without looking at her.

With that momentary jolt, the phantom also vanishes.

<blank>

Suzy turned around and traced and slid her sword as if she were paying off Kara's sword, and pressed the belly of the sword's tip against the hand in which Kara was holding the dagger.

<blank>

Using the position of the hand as a fulcrum, Suzy turns the sword and Kara's legs come up to spin away from the ground.

<blank>

Sh...shh!

<blank>

Kara's body turns to adhere to Suzy's body.

And just where Suzy's left elbow touched Kara's water moon.

<blank>

Hahaha!"

<blank>

Kara was blown backward and crashed into a wall, crumpling to the floor.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Alicia was unarmed and wearing protective gear.

He is wearing gloves, elbows, insteps, knees on shins, and a meaty supporter, and he is bouncing around in place, thumping and bouncing in small circles.

<blank>

(Fighting? And the gloves look like something a karate guy would wear.... Huh? But he wears a knife-like thing on his waist. Could it be a commando who punches and kicks you and then stabs you with a knife to stop you? The most vicious one by any chance?)

<blank>

"Well! I'm the last one. We're all dressed alike, so it looks like we're sisters, doesn't it?"

<blank>

Alicia smiles at me, but when I realize that she is a fighter, I start to see her as a Nantouka hermit in her street clothes.

<blank>

"Okay, I'm off! I'm off!

<blank>

At the signal to begin, Alicia launched her attack.

<blank>

He starts with a left backward kick, then connects with a right backward kick, and then delivers a series of kicks as if he were dancing in a dance.

<blank>

Suzy, however, easily avoided all of them.

<blank>

Eventually, Alicia flips her body and spins around while supporting her body with her hands in an inverted position, and the centrifugal force of her movement and legs spins her kick at high speed to close in on Suzy.　Oooh! Spinning 0-do kick!

<blank>

Suzy played the approaching leg with the back of her right hand.

Alicia, as if to catch the momentum of being flung away, goes backward, spins in the opposite direction, adjusts her stance, and kicks the ground again to close the gap between the two.

<blank>

Alicia drew a knife from her waist and attacked in rapid succession, combining kicks, elbows, and knees without pause.

<blank>

And when Suzy lifted her heel, leaving her right toe on the floor and brought it down with a light thump, the impact spread to the floor and Alicia was swallowed by the wave, nearly losing her balance.

Susie quickly approaches.

Alicia quickly set up a guard with her arm.

<blank>

Susie gently hits her right palm on the guard of that arm... and Alicia's body was sent flying as it was, enveloped by the impact.

<blank>

"Gghh, 'Tetsushi'? Gahaha!

<blank>

Alicia crashes into a wall and collapses, as does Kara.

<blank>

<blank>

Apparently, you graduates didn't get much of a break, unlike the two below you, did you?"

<blank>

I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like it," said Jessica amusedly, after Kara's treatment.

<blank>

"Haha, I don't know if I'm happy or frustrated..."

<blank>

and Kara giggles as she sits on the floor by the wall.

<blank>

But I'm still frustrated! I had such a great time with Sue, and now I'm graduating!"

We still have the whole summer together, so why not?"

I know, but... I wish I could have met you sooner! I wish I could have met you sooner!"

'Huh, sounds like a spoiled brat. Well, I'll have to check on Alicia! I wonder if one of her ribs is gone..."

Why do you look so happy? I'm scared!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After standing with the upperclassmen, I also dealt with the underclassmen.

<blank>

In a one-on-one group standoff, the kids were trying their best to get a bite out of Suzy.

<blank>

Among them, Stefan and Helena Slater of the 6th floor put up a moderate effort.

<blank>

Most of the children lose their will to fight with Suzy's "Friendly Finger" at the first try, but Stefan has received it many times every day, so he challenges it again and again, as if it were a new challenge.

The movement seems to have improved somewhat, perhaps as a result of the past week's preparation.

<blank>

Helena was the only person who had a negative attitude toward her when Suzy first joined the school.

<blank>

I don't approve of you!

<blank>

It was my second day at school.

Suzy was a little hurt by the sudden denial.

<blank>

<blank>

After all, hers was a jealousy born of Dana's infatuation with Suzy, whom she adored....

<blank>

Now, that dana that I admired so much is out of reach and I can't even touch myself as I am challenging him.

The pain that resonates in my core every time it is played on me makes me teary-eyed, but I get up again and again.

<blank>

Now I think I know why Dana is so crazy about this guy....

Helena was also a daughter of Amcam.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you for all your hard work. You've been a great inspiration to all of us."

I am also ... thank you ... for your help! Thank you very much.

I'm glad to hear that! I'd ask for a move from you too if I could, but I don't think I'll be able to make it today. I'll definitely ask for one soon!"

Yes! Yes, by all means! It's a pleasure to meet you!

<blank>

Susie and Ryder shook hands and promised to meet in person.

<blank>

Can I... ask you... a question?

What's up? Ask me anything you know.

Who... is... Ravi...?

<blank>

The rider's face instantly became tense.

<blank>

"Oh ...... yeah, I... yeah ......"

<blank>

The image and voice of a girl he had once known well came back to Ryder's mind.

<blank>

"I'm sorry ......, ...I can't, ...I can't answer for me.... Forgive me and give me ......."

<blank>

The rider grips his own chest and his face contorts as if he is enduring pain.

Suzy could only stare silently at such a rider.
