# 15 Suzy Knows the Truth

Slight modifications have been made.


----------------

<blank>

The building, called the Temple, was located on a hillside about a kilometer downhill southeast of the Cloud residence.

Suzy walked with Howard down the path to the temple, which was flanked by wheat fields.

<blank>

The temple I was brought to was not the majestic one that is often imagined, but a simple white building that did not stand out.

There is no high tower like a church.

<blank>

The entrance housed a heavy wooden door that was as heavy as it looked.

Howard slowly tapped the knocker on the door.

<blank>

Suzy looks up at that door as she does so.

<blank>

(I don't know, it doesn't look like a temple to me.... (It doesn't look like a temple.......a community center in terms of atmosphere? Is this relief a sign of a temple?)

<blank>

I was thinking about this as I looked at the coat of arms-like relief above the door.

Soon the door is opened with a heavy sound.

<blank>

"This is Mr. Cloud, how do you do today...? What a lovely companion you have here?"

'Susie, this is Henry, the temple head of this temple.

Nice to meet you... Suzy...

<blank>

Howard introduced the person who came out from inside and encouraged Susie to greet him.

<blank>

"Henry, this is Suzy. We took her into custody today in the woods."

<blank>

The person called Henry raised one eyebrow at the words 'protection in the woods' and moved his gaze to Howard and Suzy in turn.

<blank>

My name is Henry Jameson, and I am in charge of the temple here. My name is Henry Jameson, and I am in charge of the temple here. And what can I do for you today, Mr. Cloud?"

<blank>

Henry smiled back at Suzy, then turned to Howard and asked.

<blank>

I'm sorry to drop in unannounced, Henry, but I'm here today to ask this boy to use the apparatus.

<blank>

Henry quietly returned Howard's gaze, then invited them into the temple.

<blank>

Henry Jameson appeared to be a man of poise and composure.

He had dark brown hair mixed with gray, stroked back in an all-back style, and a beard.

He is also over 6 feet tall, which is quite tall even from Susie's point of view.

I would say he was in his mid-50s.

<blank>

What's that? I'm still tiny? Suzy was reminded once again.

<blank>

He was dressed in a white shirt and light gray slacks, very different from the image Suzy had of a priest.

Around his neck he wears a rose tie instead of a necktie.

Is it a sign of temple affiliation that the pendant is carved with the same object as the relief outside?

<blank>

They are guided by Henry and take their seats as recommended in the temple's reception room.

<blank>

Can you tell us a story?"

<blank>

In response to Henry's question, Howard briefly told him what had happened in the forest today and then got down to business.

<blank>

I want to find a way to get her back to her family. At the very least, I want to find a clue as to the whereabouts of the child's country.

<blank>

Henry meditated for a moment, then opened his mouth.

<blank>

I understand. I have to prepare for this unexpected event. Could you please wait a moment?"

Thank you. That helps."

<blank>

Henry, who had called the people, gave them few words of instruction and turned to them again.

<blank>

It takes at least half an hour to activate and fill with magic. Since we have time, I have prepared tea for you a little early. Let's talk over tea. I have to explain to Susie what we are going to do.

<blank>

He told Suzy with a smile.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Henry asked Susie as he sipped the tea poured into his cup.

<blank>

Do you understand the relationship between the physical and etheric bodies, Suzy?"

<blank>

(Etheric body? What an occult word. I know at least the name, but I don't know enough about it to give a proper answer...)

<blank>

I... don't... know.

Well, let me explain the basics you need to know about the device you are about to use.

<blank>

Henry smiled at Suzy with a smirk.

<blank>

Henry used to lecture on theology and magic at the University of King's Landing. It's worth listening to him carefully.

<blank>

Howard tells Susie with a smile as well.

<blank>

"...Kyoujyu? ...Jeremy Musun... Kyouju.

<blank>

Suzy asks in surprise.

<blank>

Haha, well, I guess that's what they used to call me.................................that was ten years ago.

<blank>

Then Henry takes another sip of tea.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The composition of a human being can be roughly divided into "body," "etheric body," "emotional body," "mental body," "psychic body," and "soul.

<blank>

The body is the existence of the 'material world'.

The material world is the embodiment of information from the spiritual world.

<blank>

Ether is a semi-material, semi-spiritual entity that transmits information from the "spiritual world" to the "material world," and is not pure matter.

<blank>

The etheric body exists in such a way that it overlaps the physical body. This is because the etheric body holds the information of the physical body.

<blank>

The ether is omnipresent and constantly transmits information to the "material world.

<blank>

The ether that contains all the information of the material world is called 'akasha'.

<blank>

Akasha" stores all the information about what has happened in the past, what is happening now, and what will happen in the future, as if it were folded up on the other side of the world.

<blank>

It is said that if we could access the records of the akasha in the abyss, we would know the truth of the world.

<blank>

But ordinary people cannot get there.

<blank>

This is because it requires extraordinary magical power, or mental power.

<blank>

Even if they could get there, it would be impossible for humans to process all the information, both physically and spiritually. At best, it would be good if we could see the top layer of information.

<blank>

However, it is not so difficult to get information on the surface of the etheric body that overlaps the physical body.

<blank>

Just as we measure the shape of the physical body with our eyes, we can measure the shape of the etheric body from a spiritual perspective.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What we are going to do this time is a spiritual examination of the etheric body. Well, we will only be able to find out its name, age, and physical condition..."

<blank>

Henry chuckled as he closed the conversation.

<blank>

"And I also know where you were born? And I also know where you were born... that's why Master Cloud asked for you this time, isn't it?"

<blank>

Howard nodded silently in affirmation.

Susie looks at Henry with a "Whoa" look on her face.

<blank>

The only thing we know is in which direction and at what distance from this reference point it was born. "The only thing we know is how far and in what direction I was born from this reference point," he said. This information is useful when examining the remains of unidentified bodies, etc."

<blank>

I see, Susie thinks.

Once we know the name, physical age, and place of birth, the identity is as good as known.

If you can find your family, you can make offerings. It certainly sounds like temple work.

<blank>

(Well, I guess it's the police's job, but I don't know about the division of roles in different worlds...)

<blank>

But what if I am not born in Coco? How will it turn out? I am a little curious.

<blank>

<blank>

How are you doing? Have you learned some things about the etheric body?"

Yes... very... interesting... teaching...

That's good to know. If you are interested, I can tell you about the connection between the emotional body, the mental body, the psychic body, and the soul, which I omitted this time because it was not directly relevant.

Yes...by all means...Kyomi...sir!

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, there was a knock at the door.

<blank>

Thank you for your patience. It seems we are ready. It has taken longer than expected, but... please come this way."

<blank>

They were led by Henry to another room.

<blank>

<blank>

It was a room with no more ornamentation than any other.

The window was probably attached to the west side, and the afternoon sun was shining in.

A large pipe organ-like object is set up on the north side of the eight-mat room.

At the top of the organ was a forest of large and small brass-colored tubes, like pipes.

In front of the organ, a black leather chair is placed almost in the center of the room, and a simple round table is placed across the chair on the opposite side of the organ.

<blank>

On top of the table was a platform that looked like a stack of blocks, on which a stone slab about the size of an A3 sheet was propped horizontally.

<blank>

The stone slab is surrounded by a frame like a frame, and crystal-like transparent ores are inlaid in the four corners. Overall, the construction is simple.

<blank>

Several narrow grooves were carved into the floor surrounding the chairs, connecting the desk to the organ.

There are three young priests in the room, constantly checking the organ and the equipment on the table.

<blank>

<blank>

Put this on your hands and sit down over here.

<blank>

Suzy is hesitant to sit for a while in front of the chair.

Henry, sensing Suzy's state of mind, whispered in her ear....

<blank>

I usually use the magic circle directly on the floor, but since Susie will be using it today, I have prepared a leather chair for her.

<blank>

I'm not going to sit in the chair where the body was laid out..." I told Suzy implicitly.

<blank>

Suzy smiled, as if relieved.

Howard puts his hand on Susie's shoulder and smiles, "It's okay.

<blank>

Susie nodded and sat back in her chair.

I sat down on the chair, looked at what I had received, and frowned again.

<blank>

(Merikensack? You want me to hit someone with this?)

<blank>

Place it on each finger, then lightly clasp your hands and wait.

<blank>

The shape is indeed a Merikensack, but the grip is tubular.

The shape is like a finger tube attached to a bicycle handle.

<blank>

Susie gripped it and put it on, then relaxed and leaned back in the chair.

<blank>

'Well, then, let us begin. Mr. Cloud, please take this chair."

<blank>

<blank>

Henry offered Howard a chair in front of the table and himself stood in front of the pipe organ and began to operate it.

If you look closely, you can see a row of equalizer levers on the part of the keyboard.

He moved them one by one as if fine-tuning them.

<blank>

Then, as if in response, the numerous pipe-like objects protruding from the top began to glow one by one.

Eventually, light begins to flow into the grooves in the floor.

The light reached the chair on which Suzy sat, surrounding it and increasing its brilliance.

<blank>

<blank>

(Ummm, I'm starting to feel warm... a little itchy, but not too bad... hmm? Is there a flurry of activity around me? But well, I don't feel threatened, and Cloud-san is here, so I guess I'm fine.... It's like I'm in lukewarm water...it's so comfortable. What's that? Have I been soaking for 30 minutes already? Was it only 10 seconds? My sense of time is... strange.)

<blank>

<blank>

'We're finally ready to go. My apologies, it has taken quite a bit of time."

<blank>

Henry's words brought me back to reality.

Apparently, it had already been more than an hour since I sat down in the chair.

Howard looks at me with concern.

<blank>

You have quite a bit of magic power...the feedback burned out some of the smaller magic circles, and it took us a while to replace them."

<blank>

Susie found several tubes lying by the organ.

<blank>

Five or six objects, some as thin as a pencil and some as thick as a magic marker pen, were lying on the floor, blackened around the middle of the brass-colored cylinder.

<blank>

<blank>

Henry told me that this is called a "stacked-tube magic circle.

<blank>

By stacking a number of small magic circles inside this tube, it is said that power can be derived with high efficiency from a small amount of space and small amount of magic power.

<blank>

The results are displayed for now. Would you like to see them?"

<blank>

Henry then turned the chair in which Suzy was sitting toward the table.

<blank>

On a stone slab on the table, what looks like letters are displayed in an orderly row...but Suzy cannot read them.

<blank>

I told him about it.

<blank>

I see, your name is displayed. Mr. 'Suzy'. You don't have a family name, do you? Her height is 153 cm, and her weight is...I am obliged to keep this information confidential..." She is 13 years old, female, and seems to have a very high potential for both physical ability and magical power. She seems to have very high potential values in both physical and magical abilities. The place of birth and its location...no indication of either distance or direction...this is..."

I said, "Henry, wait a minute. What do you mean... no display?"

Yes, perhaps it is a place that does not exist here... perhaps... I have felt that possibility, but I never really thought..."

'Explain it to me, Henry! What the hell are you talking about?"

<blank>

Howard and Henry were exchanging such conversations.

<blank>

On the other hand, Suzy's inner life was not so different.

<blank>

(Joooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!! Uzoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! 

I'm an adult, right? This body!

Ew! A minor? A child? Really? What kind of Traylor Rose are you?

Wow! What do you mean by that? What is that, the equivalent of a 32 year old man playing tricks on a 13 year old girl's body? That's not even funny! That's a crime!

No, no! It's him! It's safe! But the smell of crime is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo bad!

Haha...I guess that means Howard and Sonia's reaction was right. ......

(...... I am... 13 years old ...... ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ......)

<blank>

If I were to describe the mental image in cartoonish terms, it would be... eyes wide open with rounded whites, jaw dropped downwards, vertical lines running all over the face and background, and sweating like a waterfall.

<blank>

The shocking fact that he was underage has left him at the mercy of a lot of tossing and turning.

<blank>

<blank>

Regardless of Susie's inner storm, Howard and Henry's conversation continues.

<blank>

I had a few questions about Susie, and some of them seemed to fit. I was wondering if that was the case.

"Sign? What does it signify?"

Before we go any further, Susie. Would you mind keeping me company a little longer?"

Uh... yes.

<blank>

Susie, whose spirit had been on the verge of going somewhere, was brought back to this side of the world.

<blank>

I am going to ask you a few questions. Please answer 'yes' to all of my questions."

I understand.

<blank>

Suzy nodded cockily.

<blank>

First of all, are you an adult?"

Yes."

<blank>

The ore attached to the four corners of the stone slab glows red.

<blank>

Is your name 'Susie'?"

Yes."

<blank>

The ore does not glow.

<blank>

Are you a man?"

Yes."

<blank>

I was a little taken aback.

The ore glows red.

<blank>

The ore glows red when it responds with an untrue answer like this. This is a reaction to a discrepancy with the etheric body's information. This gives you the correct facts about things you didn't know or didn't realize.

<blank>

Susie's voice leaks out as if she is impressed.

<blank>

If you don't mind, may I ask you about Susie's family?"

(Oh, Mr. Cloud is looking at me worriedly... I see, he's been concerned about his family since the beginning... I guess he wants to know if his parents are safe... but how do you think he really feels? (Oh, Mr. Cloud is looking at me with concern... I see, he's been concerned about his family since the beginning... I wonder if his parents are safe...)

<blank>

Suzy's body was originally a game character. Her parents, as a matter of course, do not exist. But now I am here. So, do parents exist here? Does it simply end with "they don't exist"? Is there a "parent" that I don't even know exists? Or is it possible to apply real information? I'm a little curious about this.

<blank>

Yes... please... listen...

<blank>

Suzy decided to have it checked out...result.

<blank>

Suzy never knew her parents and was raised by her grandfather along with several unrelated siblings........................

<blank>

(Oh, you're coming...this is a role-play setting you created in the game! I see...! I see...oh, I made Mr. Cloud look so sad...oh, on the contrary, I'm sorry! I can't believe I made you look like that, this is really a setup...but it's strange that it's become a "fact"! Ahh~~...what to do! What should I do? Ohhhhh...! Laugh it up!)

<blank>

Susie tilted her head and smiled as best she could at Howard.

<blank>

Howard gives Suzy a slightly annoyed smile.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sorry it took so long. Susie, you must be tired."

Thank you very much.

<blank>

Henry asked Susie to work on him, and Susie smiled at his concern and answered.

<blank>

Then this is the last time. May I?"

<blank>

Suzy nodded.

<blank>

"Susie, are you... a resident of this world?"

"! Yes.

<blank>

The ore glows red.

<blank>

I see."

Henry... what do you mean?"

She is not of this world... that is all.

What the hell are you talking about? Henry! That's such a ridiculous thing to say...!"

"The signs were there... the anomaly in Deipala."

How is that connected to Susie? This girl appeared in the forest before the anomaly! It's not that relevant!"

Several days before the incident occurred, several large disturbances of magical power were observed in the depths of the Great Forest of Irosio, as if some kind of large-scale magic had been invoked.

What? No such report has come up!"

Yes, we still continued to see disturbances in the magic after the anomaly. Measurements are continuing.

<blank>

(Uhhhhhh...! Easily exposed to another world, or exposed to another world? Is this some kind of skill? Moreover........is that the one I did to myself, the one that disrupted my magic power? Hahhhhh.... Let's talk about something more fun than that! See? You said there was a deer tonight, right? Deer? Deer steak! You're a deer! You're a deer! Huh? No? What was that? What was that?)

<blank>

Suzy's spirit is trying to escape reality and go somewhere again.

<blank>

I don't know what to say.

The Great Forest of Irosio is a place where extraordinary magical power swirls around. As represented by the manifestation of the heroes 200 years ago, visitors from other worlds have been seen for some time in the Great Forest of Irosio.

<blank>

(Oooh! Suddenly, a legend of a hero! Isn't that sudden? I didn't know there was such a story! You're right! I have no way of knowing! I mean, isn't the conversation going in a strange direction! Both of you!)

<blank>

While Suzy was strangely horrified by the word "brave," Howard and Henry's conversation proceeded further.

<blank>

The only people for whom there is a solid record are those who are called 'brave' and their attendants! Other than that, there is no proof! It's just a tall tale! There is no way you could have anything to do with this girl!

In the last ten years I have identified three bodies. Strange decorations, strange characters. And the result of an unknown place of origin according to a psychic examination. If the disturbance of magic power is a sign of something unusual, like a premonition, it would not be surprising if a huge vortex of magic power distorted space and led to another dimension.

"But! It is too short-sighted to link them to this Suzy!"

But the results are positive. Dear Cloud, this is a measured fact."

"...suppose that's the case, what are you trying to say this girl is?"

The environment of the Iroquois Forest is harsh, Mr. Cloud. What would happen if an ordinary human being were suddenly thrown into the midst of its depths all by himself?

...would kill you in the blink of an eye."

Then what if they are from this village?"

Unless you're a very good person, you're no better than an amateur at the deep end!

What, then, do you see of one who survives in the land for many days?"

"............"

Perhaps many people wandered into Irosio from other places long ago, but none had the strength to survive the harsh environment of Irosio. But what if there was someone who could transcend that barrier?

'You think it's a being that appeared 200 years ago? Henry. Are you trying to tell me that Suzy is a 'hero' manifested in the modern age?"

<blank>

Howard and Henry exchanged sharp glances, then both looked at Susie.

<blank>

(Kukkah ah!

There is no such thing! There is no such thing as a brave man! Stop it!)

<blank>

Suzy, who had received their gazes, placed her hands on her thighs in a chokon, and with a big serious face in a strangely beautiful posture, she shook her head violently from side to side, just her neck.

<blank>

No! ...No! There is no...no...no...no...! I don't have... any... thing... to... do...!

<blank>

When they saw Suzy's condition, they looked at each other again and lost their expressions.

<blank>

I'm no match for Suzy."

Not at all..."

<blank>

Susie tilted her head suspiciously when she saw them suddenly lose their chemistry.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I am thankful to be here on this day, today, to be a part of it.

Henry?

If she were not able to survive in the Great Forest of Irosio, she would not be here. And it would be the same even if she never met Mr. Cloud..."

In that case, I wouldn't be here either.

As you know, in order for the equipment to work properly, the subject must be open-minded. If Suzy had distrusted us, the psychic examination would not have been so successful. I feel that this is proof that the trust between the two of you has already been established."

Susie is an honest girl..."

I understand that from our conversation. But I feel that the connection between the two of you is so deep that it is hard to believe that you have only just met. Yes, it is as if there is a soul connection..."

"...Henry... you..."

As a communicator of God's truth, I don't believe in coincidences. Everything is inevitable..."

"........."

I feel that my connection with Mr. Cloud is genuine, no matter who you are, Suzy. Please take good care of her...I am sorry, I shouldn't have interfered. Please forgive me."

Henry...thank you Henry. I'll remember you always. I'm sorry."

I think I've left Susie alone too long. We have to let her go."

If we leave it too long, his belly will start protesting again.

<blank>

They come to Suzy's side laughing, "That's tough.

<blank>

What was Suzy talking about? I listened in silence, but Howard's last words made me wonder.

What are you talking about, Mr. Cloud!

<blank>

He peeled his eyes and made silent protests with his red face and mouth agape.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy, who is standing up from the chair with Henry's hand in hers, looks at Howard with her mouth agape in protest. Howard responds with an annoyed smile.

<blank>

I'm sure you must be tired, Susie. Please rest there for a while. I'll have some tea and a cherry pie ready for you, if you like.

<blank>

Suzy's eyes turn joyful at the word cherry pie.

<blank>

"Cheerio...pai!"

"Oh, is that Daisy's cherry pie?"

Yes, my wife baked it before noon.

'That's fortuitous! Because her cherry pie is the best in the village!"

<blank>

A sigh escapes Suzy's mouth.

<blank>

Let's go. I'll have something ready for you right away."

<blank>

Susie's mood seems to have improved completely.

Henry took me and left the room happily.

Howard follows them as they watch.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I left the temple long after that.

<blank>

I'm not sure I'll be able to make it," he said, "but the sun is shining. I've come to tell you I'll be home for dinner, Sonia's worried about you."

<blank>

They were walking side by side on a road between wheat fields, facing home.

<blank>

I'm sure they're working hard cooking the deer, and if we're late, the food might get cold."

That's... a... big... deal... let's... go... now!

And for that matter, is dinner okay after a solid helping of cherry pie?"

Sweet... things... are... different... from... your... stomach!

I didn't know that."

<blank>

Laughing, the two hurried home.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy, walking on Howard's left side, stopped in her tracks.

<blank>

Hmm? What's up? Howard looks at Susie.

<blank>

'Mr. Cloud... Mr. Cloud! ・・・・ Mr. Cloud!

<blank>

Susie called Howard as if in dire need.

<blank>

What's wrong Suzy? What's going on!"

<blank>

What's going on? and Howard hurriedly turns his body toward Suzy.

<blank>

Susie grabbed Howard by the sleeve and squeezed it with both hands.

<blank>

...golden... sea... sea... fire...

<blank>

I was staring intently at the western sky with my eyes wide open, unable to move.

<blank>

<blank>

The slanting rays of the sun illuminated the wheat fields spreading endlessly before my eyes.

Ears of wheat, undulating and undulating, spread out like a vast ocean far beyond the horizon.

The swaying of the tips of the ears blown by the wind spread out like ripples.

<blank>

It is a golden sea that stretches forever as far as the eye can see under a golden burning sky.

<blank>

<blank>

...beautiful...

Suzy looked at the golden landscape in her eyes and didn't even move her body.

"・・・・・・ dream... like..."

"It's not a dream..."

<blank>

Howard gently replies to Suzy's comment.

<blank>

Suzy looked up at Howard with a start.

Howard looks into Suzy's eyes as she looks up at him and smiles gently.

<blank>

Suzy turned her eyes to the golden world again... and a single tear fell from her big eye.

<blank>

Howard was surprised.

<blank>

What's the matter, Susie? Why are you crying?"

What? What? Me? Me?

<blank>

Suzy puts her own hand to her cheek and knows that her hand has become damp with tears.

<blank>

"Why are you...? Are you ... asleep?"

<blank>

I asked Howard with spilled tears.

<blank>

Suzy.

<blank>

This time, the tears started to spill down one after another.

<blank>

Why... why... did... you... do... this... thing... to... me?

<blank>

Susie clung to Howard and just kept spilling tears.

<blank>

<blank>

What's wrong? Suzy! Are you sick? Where's the pain?

<blank>

Howard hurriedly grabbed Susie's shoulder.

<blank>

"No, no, no! Sonia! Sonia! Wait for me, Suzy! I'll take you home now!

<blank>

Howard hurriedly picked Suzy up and started down the road leading home.

<blank>

Suzy was in Howard's arms, her eyes reflecting gold as she continued to harangue and weep.



<blank>

----------------

A shocking truth was revealed! Suzy was actually 13 years old!
