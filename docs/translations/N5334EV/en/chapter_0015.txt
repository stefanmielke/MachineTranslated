# Chapter 15: Suzy Learns the Truth

I am making slight adjustments.

----------------

<b>

The building referred to as the temple was located on a hill about one kilometer southeast of the Cloud residence.

Suzy was led by Howard along the path to the temple, which was nestled between wheat fields.

<b>

The temple they arrived at was not the majestic structure one might imagine, but a modest white building that blended in.

There was no tall tower like that of a church.

<b>

At the entrance, there was a visibly heavy wooden door.

Howard gently knocked on the knocker attached to the door.

<b>

Suzy looked up at the door.

<b>

(This doesn't really feel like a temple... more like a community center? I wonder if this relief is a sign of the temple?)

<b>

She was pondering such thoughts while gazing at the emblem-like relief above the door.

Eventually, the door opened with a heavy sound.

<b>

"Ah, Lord Cloud, what brings you here today... Oh? What a lovely companion you have with you?"

"This is Suzy, I found her in the forest today."

"Nice to... meet you... I'm Suzy..."

<b>

Howard introduced the person who came out from inside to Suzy and prompted her to greet him.

<b>

"Henry, this girl is named Suzy... I found her in the forest today."

<b>

The person called Henry raised an eyebrow at the phrase "found in the forest," shifting his gaze between Howard and Suzy.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, Suzy. I am Henry Jameson, the head of this temple. Now, Lord Cloud, what is the purpose of your visit today?"

<b>

After returning Suzy's greeting with a smile, Henry turned to Howard and asked.

<b>

"I apologize for the suddenness, Henry, but we came here today to have this girl use the spirit examination device."

<b>

Henry quietly returned his gaze to Howard and then invited the two of them inside the temple.

<b>

Henry Jameson appeared to be a person with a calm demeanor.

His dark brown hair was streaked with gray, slicked back, and he had a goatee.

He stood over 180 centimeters tall, quite tall even from Suzy's perspective.

He seemed to be in his mid-50s.

<b>

Huh? Am I really that small? Suzy thought to herself once again.

<b>

His attire was a white shirt and light gray slacks, quite different from the image of a priest that Suzy had.

Instead of a tie, he wore a rose tie.

The pendant part had the same relief as the one outside, perhaps a sign of being associated with the temple.

<b>

The two were guided by Henry and took their seats in the reception room of the temple as he suggested.

<b>

"Could you please tell me your story?"

<b>

In response to Henry's question, Howard briefly recounted what had happened in the forest today and got to the main topic.

<b>

"I want to find a way to return this girl to her family. At the very least, I want a clue about the location of her country."

<b>

After a moment of contemplation, Henry opened his mouth.

<b>

"I understand. Since this is sudden, I will need to prepare. Could you please wait a moment?"

"Thank you. I appreciate it."

<b>

Henry called someone over, gave a few brief instructions, and then turned back to the two.

<b>

"It will take at least 30 minutes to activate and charge the magic. Since we have some time, I have prepared some tea a little early. Let's have tea while we talk. I need to explain to Suzy what we will be doing next."

<b>

He said with a smile directed at Suzy.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After taking a sip of the tea poured into the cup, Henry asked Suzy a question.

<b>

"Do you understand the relationship between the physical body and the etheric body?"

<b>

(Etheric body? That's an occult-sounding term. I know the name, but... even if you ask me about the relationship, I don't have enough knowledge to answer properly...)

<b>

"I don't really... understand..."

"I see... then let me explain the basic things you should know about the device we will be using."

<b>

Henry smiled at Suzy.

<b>

"I used to teach theology and magic at the university in the royal capital. It won't hurt to listen carefully."

<b>

"Professor...? Jameson... professor?"

<b>

Suzy asked back in surprise.

<b>

"Haha, well, I suppose I was called that too... but that was nearly ten years ago."

<b>

Saying that, Henry took another sip of tea.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

<b>

The composition of a human being can be broadly divided into "physical body," "etheric body," "emotional body," "mental body," "identifying body," and "soul."

The physical body is the existence of the "material world."

The "material world" is the manifestation of information from the "spiritual world."

<b>

Ether is a semi-material, semi-spiritual existence that transmits information from the "spiritual world" to the "material world" and is not pure material.

<b>

The "etheric body" exists overlapping the "physical body." This is because the etheric body holds the information of the physical body.

<b>

Ether exists throughout the world, constantly transmitting information to the "material world."

The ether that contains all information of the material world is called "Akasha."

<b>

"Akasha" preserves all information about past events, current events, and future events, folding it away behind the scenes of the world.

<b>

It is said that if one can access the records of Akasha in the abyss, one can know the truth of the world.

<b>

However, ordinary people cannot reach there.

<b>

To do so requires an extraordinary amount of magic power, that is, mental strength.

<b>

Even if one could reach it, processing all the information is impossible for humans both physically and spiritually. It would be a great achievement to merely catch a glimpse of the surface information.

<b>

However, it is not so difficult to access the surface information of the etheric body, which overlaps the physical body.

One can measure the shape of the etheric body from a spiritual perspective, just as one measures the shape of the physical body with the eyes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What we will be doing this time is examining the etheric body. Well, what can be understood is mainly the name, age, and condition of the physical body..."

<b>

Henry concluded with a wry smile.

<b>

"And we can also determine 'where you were born.' This is the reason Lord Cloud requested this, isn't it?"

<b>

Howard nodded silently in affirmation.

Suzy looked at Henry with a face that said "Ohhh."

<b>

"What can be understood is the direction and distance from this reference point where you were born. This is useful information when examining unidentified corpses, for example."

<b>

I see, Suzy thought.

If they can find out the name, physical age, and place of birth, then they would have essentially identified the person.

If they can find the family, they can offer them prayers. It certainly feels like temple work.

<b>

(Well, I think it's also police work, but I can't really understand the division of roles in a different world...)

<b>

But what about me, who probably isn't from here? How will the results turn out? I'm a bit curious about that.

<b>

<b>

"How about it? Do you understand a bit about the etheric body now?"

"Yes... it's very... interesting... I'm curious..."

"That's good to hear. If you're interested, I can also tell you about the connections between the 'emotional body,' 'mental body,' 'identifying body,' and 'soul' later on, as I skipped that this time since it wasn't directly related."

"Yes... please... I'm interested!"

<b>

Just then, there was a knock at the door.

<b>

"Thank you for waiting. It seems the preparations are complete. Although it took longer than expected... please come this way."

<b>

The two were guided by Henry to a different room.

<b>

<b>

This room was even more sparsely decorated than the others.

The window was likely on the west side, as the afternoon sunlight was streaming in.

In the north side of the room, there was a large structure resembling a pipe organ.

Above that organ, numerous brass-colored tubes stood like pipes.

And in front of the organ, almost in the center of the room, there was a black leather chair, with a simple round table placed opposite the organ.

<b>

On that table was a platform stacked like blocks, and an A3-sized stone tablet was leaning against it sideways.

<b>

The stone tablet was surrounded by a frame resembling a picture frame, with transparent crystals embedded in the corners. Overall, the construction was quite simple.

<b>

The floor had several thin grooves carved into it, connecting the chair, table, and organ.

Inside the room, three young priests were busily checking the organ and the equipment on the table.

<b>

<b>

"Please put this on both hands and have a seat here."

<b>

Suzy hesitated for a moment before sitting down in front of the chair.

Noticing Suzy's demeanor, Henry leaned in and whispered...

<b>

"Don't worry, usually we use the magic circle on the floor directly, but today we've prepared a leather chair for you to use."

<b>

He implied that she wouldn't be sitting in a chair where a corpse had been laid.

<b>

Suzy smiled with relief and made a beaming smile.

Howard placed a hand on Suzy's shoulder and smiled reassuringly.

<b>

Suzy nodded and settled into the chair.

As she sat in the chair and looked at what she was given, she frowned again.

<b>

(Is this a brass knuckle? Are they telling me to punch someone with this???)

<b>

"Please fit this onto each finger and hold your hands lightly together while you wait."

<b>

The shape was indeed like a brass knuckle, but the gripping part was tubular.

It resembled a bicycle handlebar with finger tubes attached.

<b>

Suzy fitted it on, relaxed her grip, and leaned back in the chair.

<b>

"Now, I will begin. Lord Cloud, please take a seat in this chair."

<b>

<b>

Henry offered the chair in front of the table to Howard and began to operate the pipe organ himself.

Upon closer inspection, the part that corresponded to the keys had levers resembling an equalizer lined up.

He was adjusting them one by one with precision.

<b>

As he did, countless pipe-like structures protruding above began to glow one by one in response.

Eventually, the light began to flow into the grooves on the floor.

The light reached the chair where Suzy was sitting, surrounding it and increasing in brightness.

<b>

(Hmm, is it getting warm? It's a bit ticklish, but it doesn't feel bad... Huh? Is it getting busy around me? But I don't feel any sense of crisis, and since Lord Cloud is here, I guess I'm okay... It feels like I'm soaking in lukewarm water. Huh? Have I been soaking for about 30 minutes? Or was it just about 10 seconds? ... My sense of time feels... different.)

<b>

<b>

"Finally, the preparations are complete. I apologize for the considerable delay."

<b>

Henry's words jolted Suzy back to reality.

It seemed that over an hour had already passed since she sat in the chair.

Howard was looking at her with a worried expression.

<b>

"You have quite a significant amount of magic power... Several small magic circles were burned out due to feedback, and it took time to replace them."

<b>

Suzy noticed several tubes lying next to the organ.

<b>

There were five or six tubes, the thinnest being about the size of a pencil, and the thickest about the thickness of a marker, rolling on the floor, darkened in the middle.

<b>

Henry explained that these were called "stacked tube-type magic circles."

<b>

By stacking small magic circles inside these tubes, one could draw out power with high efficiency using a small space and minimal magic.

<b>

"Now, the results have been displayed. Would you like to see them?"

<b>

Henry said this as he turned Suzy's chair towards the table.

<b>

On the stone tablet on the table, some letters were neatly displayed, but... Suzy couldn't read them.

<b>

When she conveyed this, he responded.

<b>

"I see, your name is displayed. 'Suzy.' It appears you do not have a family name. Your height is 153 cm, weight is... this next part is subject to confidentiality... 13 years old, female. It seems you have very high potential values for both physical abilities and magic. As for your place of origin and its location... there are no distance or direction readings... this is..."

"Henry, wait a moment. What do you mean there are no readings?"

"Yes, it seems that the place does not exist here... I suspected this possibility, but I never thought it would be true..."

"Explain, Henry! What exactly are you saying?"

<b>

Howard and Henry were engaged in such a conversation.

<b>

However, Suzy's inner thoughts were far from such discussions.

<b>

(Thirteen years old?! What the hell?! I'm a teenager!!! 

No way! I look like an adult, right?! This body!!

Wait?! A minor? A child? Seriously?! What kind of trick is this?!

Oh no! Does that mean a 32-year-old man did something inappropriate to a 13-year-old girl?! That's not funny! It's a crime!!

N-no! This is me! So it's safe! But it smells like crime all over!!

Haaa... So Howard and Sonia's reactions were correct...

...I am... 13 years old... ugh...)

<b>

If I were to express my inner turmoil in a cartoonish way... my eyes would be wide open, my jaw would drop dramatically, lines would be drawn all over my face and background, and I would be sweating profusely.

<b>

The shocking fact of being a minor left Suzy in a state of turmoil.

<b>

Meanwhile, the conversation between Howard and Henry continued, oblivious to Suzy's inner storm.

<b>

"From what I've heard about Suzy, there were several matching parts... so I had a suspicion."

"Matching parts? What do you mean by that?"

"Before that... Suzy, could you stay with us a bit longer?"

"Ah... y-yes."

<b>

Suzy, whose mind was wandering, was brought back to the present.

<b>

"I will ask you a few questions now. Please answer all my questions with 'yes.'"

"Y-yes... I understand..."

<b>

Suzy nodded.

<b>

"First, are you an adult?"

"Yes."

<b>

The crystals in the corners of the stone tablet glowed red.

<b>

"Is your name 'Suzy'?"

"Yes."

<b>

The crystals did not glow.

<b>

"Are you male?"

"Yes."

<b>

Suzy felt a slight jolt, but the crystals glowed red.

<b>

"When you give an answer that contradicts the facts, the crystals will glow red. This reacts when there is a discrepancy with the information of the etheric body. It can also reveal truths that you may not have known or realized."

<b>

Suzy let out a soft "Ohhh" in admiration.

<b>

"If you don't mind, may I ask about your family, Suzy?"

(Oh, Lord Cloud is looking at me with concern... I see, he has been worried about my family from the start... He probably wants to know if my parents are safe... But what is the actual situation?)

<b>

Suzy's body was originally that of a game character. Naturally, she shouldn't have any parents. However, she was here now. So does that mean there are parents in this world? Will it just end with "they don't exist"? Is there a "parent" that she doesn't even know about? Or will real-world information be applied? This was a matter of some interest.

<b>

"Yes... please... ask..."

<b>

Suzy decided to let them investigate... and the result was.

<b>

Suzy did not know her parents' faces and was raised by her grandfather along with several non-blood-related siblings...

<b>

(So that's how it is... This is just the roleplay setting I created in the game! So that's how it comes! I see! Oh, I made Lord Cloud look so solemn... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to make him look like that, this was supposed to be just a setting... But it's strange that it has become 'fact'! Ahhh! What should I do!? Alright! Just smile it off!)

<b>

Suzy tilted her head and threw her biggest smile at Howard.

<b>

Howard returned a slightly troubled smile to Suzy.

<b>

<b>

"I've taken quite a bit of time. Suzy, you must be tired, right?"

"Thank... you... I'm... still... okay..."

<b>

Henry asked Suzy with a caring tone, and she smiled in response to his concern.

<b>

"Now, this will be the last question. Is that alright?"

<b>

Suzy nodded.

<b>

"Suzy, are you... a resident of this world?"

"！... Yes."

<b>

The crystals glowed red.

<b>

"Is that so?"

"Henry... what does this mean?"

"It means she is not from this world..."

"What are you saying, Henry? Such an absurd thing...!"

"I had a premonition... the disturbance in Deipara."

"...How does that relate to Suzy? She appeared in the forest before the disturbance! The correlation is slim!"

"Several days before the disturbance occurred, significant fluctuations in magic power were observed deep in the Iroshio Great Forest... It seems like large-scale magic was activated."

"What!? There have been no such reports!"

"Yes, even after the disturbance, fluctuations in magic power have continued to be confirmed. Measurements are ongoing."

<b>

(Wow! Did I just get exposed as a person from another world? I barely interacted with anyone for half a day and got found out! Is this some kind of skill? Moreover... the fluctuations in magic power are probably due to my actions?! Oh wow... But more importantly, let's talk about something more fun! Come on! Didn't you say tonight was about deer? Deer, right? Deer steak!! You are a deer! You will become a deer! Huh? No? What was it again??)

<b>

Suzy's mind was trying to escape reality again.

<b>

"...What does this mean?"

"There are unusual magical energies swirling in the Iroshio Great Forest. We cannot predict what might happen with just one trigger. As represented by the appearance of the hero 200 years ago, visitors from other worlds have been confirmed in the Iroshio Great Forest."

<b>

(Wow! Suddenly the hero legend?! Isn't that abrupt?! I had no idea such a story existed! Of course! I have no way of knowing!! But wait, is the conversation going in a strange direction?! You two!!)

<b>

While Suzy felt a strange shiver at the mention of the hero, Howard and Henry's conversation continued.

<b>

"The only ones with certain records are those referred to as 'heroes' and their companions! There is no evidence beyond that! It's just nonsense! There's no way this child is related to that!!"

"In the last ten years, I have confirmed three corpses. Unknown decorations, unknown writing. And the results from the spirit examination show an unknown place of origin. If the fluctuations in magic power are a premonition or foreshock of the disturbance, then it is not strange at all if a massive vortex of magic distorted space and connected to another dimension."

"But! To link that to Suzy is too simplistic!!"

"However, the results indicate a positive correlation. Lord Cloud, this is a measured fact."

"...Even if that is the case, what are you saying this child is?"

"Lord Cloud, the environment of the Iroshio Great Forest is harsh. What would happen if an ordinary person were suddenly thrown alone into the depths of it?"

"...They would likely lose their life in an instant."

"What about someone from this village?"

"Unless they are quite exceptional, they would be no different from an amateur alone in the depths!"

"Then, what would you call someone who survives alone in that place for several days?"

"............"

"Perhaps many people have wandered into Iroshio from other worlds for a long time... However, no one possessed the strength to survive the harsh environment of Iroshio. But if there were someone who could overcome that barrier..."

"Are you saying that is the existence that appeared 200 years ago? ...Henry. Are you suggesting that Suzy is the 'hero' who has manifested in the present?"

<b>

Howard and Henry exchanged sharp glances before turning their gaze to Suzy in unison.

<b>

(No way!! No way!! I'm not a hero!! Stop it!!)

<b>

Receiving their gaze, Suzy placed her hands neatly on her thighs, maintaining an oddly elegant posture, and vigorously shook her head side to side with a serious expression.

<b>

"No! No!! No... I'm not... a hero!!!"

<b>

Seeing Suzy's reaction, the two exchanged glances and broke into smiles.

<b>

"I can't compete with Suzy."

"Absolutely..."

<b>

Seeing the two suddenly break into smiles, Suzy tilted her head in confusion.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Lord Cloud, I am grateful to be present on this day and in this encounter."

"...Henry?"

"If, hypothetically, she could not survive in the Iroshio, she would not be here. Moreover, she would not have met Lord Cloud."

"In that case, I wouldn't be here either..."

"As you know, for the spirit examination device to function properly, the subject must be open-hearted. If Suzy had distrust towards us, the spirit examination would not have succeeded to this extent. I feel this is proof that the trust between the two of you has already been established."

"Suzy is a straightforward child..."

"Indeed, I understood that from our conversation. However, the bond between the two of you feels deeper than one would expect from just having met. It feels as if there is a connection that binds your souls..."

"...Henry... what are you saying?"

"As a messenger of divine reason, I do not believe in coincidences. Everything is a necessity..."

"........."

"I feel that no matter who Suzy is, her bond with Lord Cloud is genuine. Please cherish it... I apologize for my presumptuous remarks. Please forgive me."

"...Henry... thank you, Henry. I will engrave that in my heart. I'm sorry."

"Oh dear, we have left Suzy alone for too long. We must release her."

"That's not good. If we leave her too long, her stomach will start protesting again."

<b>

That would be quite a problem, haha, they both laughed as they approached Suzy.

<b>

Suzy was silently listening, wondering what they were talking about, but at Howard's last words, she thought,

W-what are you saying, Lord Cloud!!

<b>

With Henry taking her hand and helping her stand from the chair, Suzy pouted and shot a protesting look at Howard. Howard returned a troubled smile.

<b>

"Suzy, you must be tired, right? Please rest over there for a while. I can prepare some tea and, if you'd like, some cherry pie."

<b>

At the mention of cherry pie, Suzy's eyes lit up with joy.

<b>

"Cherry... pie?!"

"Oh, is it Daisy's cherry pie?"

"Yes, she baked it earlier today."

"That's a stroke of luck! Her cherry pie is the best in the village!"

<b>

A silent sigh of relief escaped Suzy's lips.

<b>

"Then let's go. I will have it ready soon."

<b>

Suzy's mood seemed to have brightened considerably.

She followed Henry happily as they left the room.

Howard watched them, following behind.

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was quite some time later that they finally left the temple.

<b>

"This is not good, the sun is quite low. I told Sonia I would return for dinner, so she must be worried."

<b>

The two walked side by side along the path flanked by wheat fields, heading home.

<b>

"I'm sure she's busy preparing the deer, so if we take too long, the meal will get cold."

"That would... be terrible... let's... hurry... home!"

"By the way, will you be alright for dinner after having a good cherry pie?"

"I can eat... sweets... separately!"

"I didn't know that."

<b>

They laughed as they hurried home.

<b>

<b>

Suzy, walking on Howard's left, suddenly stopped.

<b>

"Huh? What's wrong?" Howard looked at Suzy.

<b>

"Lord Cloud... Lord Cloud! ... Lord Cloud!!"

<b>

Suzy called out to Howard urgently.

<b>

"What is it, Suzy? Is something wrong?!"

<b>

Howard quickly turned to Suzy, concerned.

<b>

Suzy grabbed Howard's sleeve tightly with both hands.

<b>

"...The golden... sea... is... burning..."

<b>

She was staring wide-eyed at the western sky, completely still.

<b>

The setting sun illuminated the endless expanse of the wheat fields before her.

The waves of wheat swayed in large undulations, stretching to the horizon like a vast ocean.

The tips of the wheat swayed in the wind, spreading like ripples.

<b>

It was a golden sea under a sky ablaze with golden hues.

<b>

"...So beautiful..."

Suzy reflected the golden scenery in her eyes, not moving an inch.

"...It feels like a dream..."

"It is not a dream..."

<b>

Howard gently replied to Suzy's murmured words.

<b>

Startled, Suzy looked up at Howard.

Gazing into Suzy's eyes, Howard smiled gently.

<b>

Suzy turned her gaze back to the golden world... and a single tear rolled down from her large eyes.

<b>

Howard gasped in surprise.

<b>

"What’s wrong, Suzy? Why are you crying?"

"...Huh? ...Me? ...Crying?"

<b>

Suzy touched her cheek with her hand and realized it was damp with tears.

<b>

"...W-why? ...Am I... crying?"

<b>

She asked Howard, still letting the tears fall.

<b>

"...Suzy..."

<b>

This time, tears began to fall one after another.

<b>

"...W-why... is this... happening..."

<b>

Suzy clung to Howard, continuing to shed tears.

<b>

"What’s wrong?! Suzy! Are you feeling unwell? Is there somewhere that hurts?!"

<b>

Howard grabbed Suzy's shoulders in a panic.

<b>

"N-no! Sonia! Sonia!! Wait, Suzy! I’ll take you home right away!!"

<b>

Howard quickly lifted Suzy and started running down the path leading home.

<b>

Suzy continued to cry, reflecting the golden light in her eyes as she was held in Howard's arms.

<b>

----------------

The shocking truth is revealed! Suzy is actually 13 years old!!
