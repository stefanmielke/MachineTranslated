# Chapter 42: The Spring of Amukam

Thank you for your patience. Chapter 2 starts now.

For the time being, I will be posting the completed parts daily.

If you would like, please accompany me again.

<b>

A gentle sunlight that feels the arrival of spring.

The new greenery peeking out with the melting snow and the chirping of birds were heralding the end of winter.

<b>

It is now the blue moon of the second month.

Having passed the harsh cold of the red moon of the first month, it is the time when the winds begin to carry a gentle atmosphere.

<b>

The winter in Amukam is unexpectedly severe.

Typically, the snow melt must wait for the red moon of the second month, but this year, most of the snow had already transformed into the flow of the river.

<b>

Here in Coop Town, the gateway to Amukam County, there is no longer any white snow indicating winter except in the shadows that do not see the sun all day long.

<b>

Coop Town is the gateway and terminal town of Amukam County.

Those who have business in the villages of Amukam County must first stop by this town.

Additionally, those heading to the center from the villages will first take the stagecoach from here to Dekkenbel.

<b>

Coop Town is a small town with a total population of about 3,000.

The town, built around the stagecoach stop, features beautifully arranged cobblestones, spreading out in a grid pattern centered around the main street that leads south from the stop.

Most of the buildings are half-timbered, with beautiful white plaster walls creating a picturesque streetscape.

<b>

Buildings facing the main street are mostly shops dealing in Amukam-produced goods and wholesalers.

The main street sees not only stagecoaches but also many carts used by such shops for transportation.

One street in from the main street, the road is too narrow for carts to pass.

There is a lot of foot traffic, with countless retail stalls lining the streets, creating a bustling market atmosphere.

<b>

Coop Town is also a commercial area where more people come and go than its population suggests.

<b>

Where there are many people, troubles inevitably arise, and unsavory characters also emerge in due course.

In this country, the knights maintain public order.

However, there are no knights stationed in small regional cities like Coop Town.

Instead, soldiers known as guards are stationed to handle people's troubles and maintain order.

<b>

Thanks to the guards' efforts, the crime rate in Coop Town is extremely low.

This is due to the presence of the guards and the fact that the locals fully understand the strength of the residents of Amukam.

There are hardly any foolish individuals who would act out openly here.

However, it does not mean that there are no lawless individuals at all.

Most of those who cause disturbances are outsiders who do not understand Amukam.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Here too, there were outsiders who had flowed in from elsewhere, unaware of Amukam.

<b>

They were originally illegal immigrants. They did not choose honest jobs and did not hesitate to steal from others to make a living.

It was a dump where such people gathered.

They had eventually become bandits, a collective threat to the people.

<b>

Having flowed in from an eastern city, they initially thought they could easily exploit the northern country folk with minimal violence, as they always had.

However, they did not understand the strength of the northern people.

<b>

It was still a bright afternoon.

As they entered the town, the first place they set their sights on was a clothing store.

In front of the store were high-quality items that were rarely seen in the city they came from, carelessly displayed.

Inside the store were only two young girls, barely twenty years old.

<b>

In their eyes, this appeared to be the perfect prey.

<b>

This was a back street with few people around.

With this number, they could invade without resistance.

With such high-end goods displayed, the store's safe must surely contain enough cash to satisfy them.

If time allowed, they might even have the luxury of enjoying the girls.

No, they could just take them away and enjoy them fully before selling them.

<b>

They inflated such convenient imaginations and entered the store with lewd smiles on their faces.

<b>

The abnormality came suddenly.

As a seemingly timid girl approached for customer service, one of the men pointed a knife at her and made a crude threat.

In that instant, the man collapsed to the ground.

<b>

They did not understand what had happened; in the blink of an eye, half of their eight companions had been subdued.

Those who lost consciousness in an instant were fortunate.

Some were rendered unable to chew for life, some had their arms grotesquely twisted, and some would never again set foot on the ground.

That brutality was carried out by just two young female clerks.

Those who could not comprehend the situation were successively knocked down by them.

Only those with quick crisis detection abilities managed to escape from the scene.

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

They did not know how they had escaped.

When they realized it, they were left with just the two of them.

They desperately suppressed their ragged breathing and hid in an alley.

<b>

"What the hell?! What is going on here?!"

"I don't know! What the hell was that?! Did you see it?!"

"I don't get it... Wasn't that guy's lower leg in a weird shape?!"

"How many places was that arm bent at?"

<b>

The two recalled the scene, their faces smeared with unkempt beards that hadn't been groomed for days turning pale, feeling a chill run up their spines.

<b>

"This can't be possible! Are the store clerks in the north all crazy?!"

"Damn it! It's because there were knights in Dekkenbel! It all started from there! It all went wrong from there! The boss got caught, and we all got scattered! Why did we end up trying to escape to this backwater?! Damn it!"

"Who was the idiot who suggested we break into that store?! What are we going to do now?! This place is dangerous too! We need to get out of here fast!!"

"So where the hell are we supposed to escape to?! Damn it! It's that idiot who thoughtlessly brandished a knife!"

<b>

The two continued their meaningless argument.

Blaming each other for what happened, they endlessly repeated their self-centered excuses, insisting they were blameless.

<b>

Suddenly, both of them stopped moving.

They noticed a shadow approaching the small street adjacent to the alley where they were hiding.

It could be the guards pursuing them...

The two held their breath in fear and peeked out into the street.

However, what appeared was not the guards they feared.

<b>

It was a girl holding a large basket with both hands.

She was probably around 12 or 13 years old, a petite girl wrapped in a thick cloak, with her head covered by a hood.

Even from this distance, it was clear that the fabric of the cloak was of good quality.

This suggested that the girl lived in a wealthy environment.

Her rosy skin peeking out from under the hood, along with her well-shaped nose and mouth, easily hinted at her beauty.

<b>

The two exchanged lewd grins once again.

<b>

"That’s a rich kid. What should we do? Hey."

"Hehe, she looks like a girl from a good family... I could handle her alone! Sounds good, right? Hehe."

"If we strip her, she should fetch a decent amount of money... She must have enough cash! She could also serve as a hostage while we escape!"

"And we could have some fun with that stripped girl until we get away! Hehe."

"What? You like that kind of girl?"

"Huh? She’s definitely useful! If you’re not going to do it, I’ll handle it myself!"

"I didn’t say I wouldn’t do it! After everything we’ve been through, I deserve a little comfort!"

"Hehe! Then it’s settled!"

<b>

With such self-centered reasoning, the two deepened their vulgar smiles.

And once they confirmed that the girl had turned her back, they quickly dashed out from the alley.

<b>

What they had to do was simple.

Subdue her by force, silence her with a knife, bind her with the rag they had, and carry her away.

With such a haphazard and sloppy plan in mind, the two ran towards the girl.

One of the men expertly twirled the knife in his right hand and reached out with his left hand to cover the girl’s mouth from behind.

<b>

Just as that hand was about to touch the girl, her figure vanished from sight.

In the next moment, the man felt his body floating in the air.

Suddenly, his vision showed the sky.

At the same time, something flew into his body.

It struck him hard in the solar plexus, causing the contents of his stomach to rise to his throat.

Immediately after, he received a strong impact to his face and lost consciousness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Two filthy men lay in an unnatural position, piled up against the wall of a back street where snow still remained.

The men had crashed into a high stack of wooden boxes piled against the wall, causing the bottles of liquor packed inside to shatter spectacularly.

Due to the loud noise, many people began to peek into the deserted street, some opening windows to see what was happening.

<b>

The gaze of the people was directed at a girl holding a large basket with both hands, looking down at the two men.

<b>

The girl shook her head while still holding the basket and skillfully lowered her hood.

The red hair that spilled from the hood sparkled in the light. Freed from the confines of the hood, her hair, gathered in pigtails, bounced as if bursting.

Her flame-like hair shimmered in the light, scattering a ruby-like brilliance, and the overflowing sparkle dissolved into the atmosphere.

<b>

Her cobalt green eyes, clear like the sea, blinked.

Those large eyes, seemingly overflowing with light, shone brightly.

<b>

<b>

In the shadowy back alley, only one corner was illuminated by dancing light.

<b>

<b>

The people peering into the back alley could not take their eyes off that scene.

They simply stared at it in a daze.

<b>

That corner where the light danced.

The girl who tilted her head in wonder, looking down at the men.

<b>

Suzie Cloud, with her ruby-like hair sparkling.
