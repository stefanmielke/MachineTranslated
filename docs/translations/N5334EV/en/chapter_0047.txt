# 42 - Spring in Amkam

Thank you for your patience, and here we are at the start of chapter 2.

In the meantime, we will continue to bring up what we are currently writing on a daily basis.

Please come back and visit us if you like.

Mild sunshine with the feeling of spring.

Fresh greenery peeked out as the snow melted, and the chirping of birds also signaled the end of winter.

<blank>

Now it's 2 Souzuki.

After the coldest month of the year, the red month, the wind begins to bring a gentle breeze.

<blank>

The winters in Amkam are surprisingly harsh.

Usually we have to wait for two red moons for the snow to melt, but this year most of the snow has already transformed itself into a river flow.

<blank>

Even here in Copetown, the gateway to Amcom County, you will not see the whiteness of winter snow on the cobblestones except in the shade where the sun does not shine all day long.

<blank>

Copetown is the gateway and terminal town for Amcom County.

Those who have business in the villages of Amkham County must first stop in this town.

Those from the villages who wish to reach the center must first take a stagecoach to De Kembel.

<blank>

This Copetown is a small town with a total population of about 3,000.

The townscape, built around a stagecoach stop, is beautifully laid out with neatly arranged cobblestones, and spreads out in a grid pattern around the main street that runs from the stop to the south.

Most of the buildings were made of half-timber frame construction, with white plaster walls creating a beautiful cityscape.

<blank>

Most of the buildings facing the main street are stores and wholesalers of Amkam products.

The boulevard is not only used by stagecoaches, but also by the many horse-drawn carriages used by stores like this one for transportation.

One turn off the main street and the street width is impassable for horse-drawn carriages.

The market was bustling with people and countless retail stalls.

<blank>

Copetown is also a commercial area with more people coming and going than its population numbers.

<blank>

If there are many people, there will inevitably be trouble, and there will inevitably be bad people.

In this country, the security is maintained by the Order of the Knights.

However, there are no regular knights residing in small provincial cities like Copetown.

Instead, guards were stationed to deal with people's problems and maintain order.

<blank>

The crime rate in Copetown is extremely low, due in part to the service of the guards.

This is because, along with the presence of the guards, everyone in the region is fully aware of the power of the inhabitants of Amkam.

There is no one here who would do anything foolish on the surface.

However, this is not to say that there are no lawless people.

However, most of those who cause a commotion are strangers who do not understand Amcam.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Here, too, were those who had drifted in from other places where they had never heard of Amkam.

<blank>

They are former illegals. They do not choose serious jobs and do not hesitate to rob others for food.

It was a cesspool of such people.

They had at some point become bandits and collectively threatened the people.

<blank>

They had drifted in from the eastern cities and at first thought they could easily exploit the northern countryside with a little violence, as they had always done.

But they did not understand the power of the people of the North.

<blank>

The sun is still high in the afternoon.

When they entered the town, the first thing they noticed was a western clothing store.

In the storefronts, high quality goods, rarely seen in the cities they were in, were randomly lined up.

The only two people in the restaurant are two young girls who are not yet twenty years old.

<blank>

In their eyes, it was the perfect prey.

<blank>

This is a back street with few people.

If this many people break in, we can overrun them without making them resist.

With such an array of luxury goods, there should be enough cash in the store's vault to satisfy themselves.

If time permits, there may be room to have fun with these girls.

No, just take them away and enjoy them to the fullest and then sell them.

<blank>

They walked into the store with such a convenient imagination and a churlish smile on their faces.

<blank>

The anomaly was abrupt.

The moment one of the men pointed a knife in his hand at the quiet-looking girl who approached him to serve him and made a crude threat.

The man collapsed on the spot.

<blank>

I didn't know what happened; before I could see, half of my eight companions had been seized.

Those who were hunted into consciousness in an instant were lucky.

Some were rendered unable to chew for the rest of their lives, some had their arms bent crookedly, and some would never be able to step on the earth again.

The tyranny was perpetrated by only two young, elderly female clerks.

Those who failed to understand the situation were reaped by them one after another.

Only those who were able to perceive the danger very quickly were able to escape from the situation.

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

I don't know where he escaped from.

They found themselves alone together.

They struggled to control their ragged breathing and hid in an alleyway.

<blank>

What? What the hell is this?

I don't know! What the hell was that? Did you see that?

I don't know... did he have a weird shape from the knees down?

That arm... how many places was it bent?"

<blank>

They both remembered the scene, their faces blue with stubble that had not been groomed for days, and felt a chill shiver run up their spines.

<blank>

This is impossible! Are the people up north crazy, even the clerks?

Tic'sho! It's because the Knights of Dekenberger were there! That's where it started! That's where things started to go wrong! That's where they got the head, that's where we all got split up! How the hell did we end up running away to the countryside? Shit!

Who the hell is that? Who was that guy who suggested breaking into that store? What are we going to do? This place is in trouble too! We gotta get Toto and get out of here!

I said, "So where do you want me to run to? Damn it! That idiot pulled a knife on me without thinking!

<blank>

They continued to have such meaningless arguments.

They go on and on about how it's that thing's fault, whose fault it is, and how they have nothing to blame themselves for.

<blank>

Suddenly they stopped moving.

They noticed a figure approaching the small street bordering the alleyway where they now lurk.

It could be the guards following the two .......

The two held their fears and peeked down the street under their breath.

But it was not the guards they feared who appeared there.

<blank>

It was a girl holding a large basket with both hands.

A petite girl, probably 12 or 3 years old, is walking around in a thick cloak and hood up to her head.

Even from here, one can tell that the fabric of the cloak is of good quality.

It was a sign that the girl was living in a rich environment.

The girl's good skin, which peeks out from her hood, and the tip of her nose and mouth, which are well-shaped, make it easy to imagine the girl's capacity as well.

<blank>

Grinning, the two men smiled again, a wild, thin smile.

<blank>

'That's a rich kid. What are you going to do? Hey."

I'm sure I'll be fine on my own! It's good, isn't it? Heh heh heh.

I'm sure you've got plenty of money! You've got enough money! You could be a hostage while we escape!

And I can play with the skinny kid until I get away with it! Heh heh heh.

"What? You like that kid?"

What? I can use it well enough! If you don't do it, I'll do it myself!

I never said I wouldn't do it! I've been through a lot up to this point. It wouldn't hurt to have a little consolation!"

Heh heh heh! Then it's settled!"

<blank>

With such self-centered logic, the two went on to further deepen their servile smiles.

Then he made sure the girl showed her back and quickly ran out of the alleyway.

<blank>

What we have to do is simple.

You can restrain them by force, silence them with a knife, restrain them with the rags you have, and carry them away as they are.

Drawing up such a haphazard and sloppy plan, the two run toward the girl.

A man spun a knife in his right hand as if he were familiar with it, and reached out with his left hand to hold the girl's mouth from behind.

<blank>

When his hand was about to touch the girl, her figure was scratched out of sight.

The next moment, the man felt his body floating in the air.

Suddenly, the vision reflects the sky.

At the same time something jumped into my body.

The sole is reduced to the dove tail without killing the momentum, and the contents come up to the man's throat.

Immediately after, he received a strong shock to the face and let go of consciousness as it was.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Two dirty men were folded in an unnatural position against the wall of a still-snowy back street.

The men jumped into a pile of crates stacked high on the wall, splitting and splattering the liquor bottles that were packed inside along with the crates.

The sound was quite loud, so many people peeked into the empty streets and opened their windows to see what was going on. Many people peeked into the empty streets and opened their windows to see what was going on.

<blank>

The people were looking at a girl holding a large basket in both hands and looking down at the two men.

<blank>

The girl shook her head while holding the basket and dexterously lowered the hood that covered it.

Her red hair, spilling from her hood, shimmered in the light. Released from the hood, her hair, which had been held in place by a picktail, shook as if it were bouncing.

Her flaming hair shimmers like rubies through the light, and the overflowing sparkles dissolve into the air and disappear.

<blank>

Cobalt green eyes like the clear ocean twinkled.

Her eyes are large and bright and seem to be overflowing with light.

<blank>

<blank>

In the sun-shadowed back alley, a glow danced only in one corner of it.

<blank>

<blank>

People peering into the back streets could not take their eyes off the place.

I just kept looking at it as if I were dumbfounded.

<blank>

The corner where its light dances.

Tilt your head curiously and look down at the girl looking down at the men.

<blank>

Suzy Cloud with her shimmering red jade hair.
