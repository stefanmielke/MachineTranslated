# Chapter 182: The Niven Family Father and Son

"Recently, it seems you've discovered some irregularities in the academy's administration?"

<b>

The mouth, adorned with a rich mustache, spoke towards Dalton.

<b>

His slightly wavy white-blond hair was evenly parted in the center and flowed naturally back.

Even in middle age, his low voice, emanating from a muscular body exceeding 180 centimeters, could easily instill a sense of intimidation in others.

<b>

However, the person directly addressed remained remarkably calm.

<b>

"It is due to my own lack of virtue. I am currently in the process of thorough examination. Lord Goldberg."

<b>

Dalton Banjo placed his hand on his chest and bowed his head, informing Robert Randall Goldberg.

<b>

"As one of the academy's directors, I cannot overlook this matter. I urge you to expedite the investigation by any means necessary."

<b>

"Yes. I plan to convene an emergency board meeting within this month. I would greatly appreciate your attendance."

<b>

"Understood."

<b>

<b>

<b>

"—It would be irresponsible to trouble you, my lord..."

<b>

A whisper drifted from a group a little distance away.

When Dalton glanced over, he saw Lawrence Niven slightly shrugging his shoulders, turning his back.

<b>

"Indeed, there is responsibility! After all, once resolved, I shall resign..."

<b>

"Wait, wait, Dalton. No one will accept such a convenient way for you to take responsibility, you know?"

<b>

"Indeed. Banjo, in your position, you must fulfill your duties."

<b>

"Ugh, Bona, even Lord Goldberg..."

<b>

"However, I hear that the matter will soon be settled."

<b>

"Yes, indeed, Lord Reinberger. Thanks to the capable staff I was able to borrow."

<b>

Dalton replied to the seemingly kind gentleman, Codeweiner Reinberger, head of the Dekkenbel Magical Information Bureau, who was stroking his chin.

<b>

"Ah, it was cooperation from Lord Cloud, wasn't it?"

<b>

"Indeed, he is exceptionally capable and has been a great help."

<b>

"Well, that is reassuring."

<b>

Codeweiner Reinberger nodded with a soft smile, his chestnut hair resembling that of his son.

<b>

"By the way, it seems that Elder Manavidan is not here? Knowing him, I can't imagine he would refuse an invitation to a banquet..."

<b>

"Apparently, one of his young disciples has just completed their first job today. He is said to be attending that celebration. I hear he will come over at an appropriate time."

<b>

"Hmm, as expected of the head of Dekkenbel."

<b>

"Speaking of which, Dalton, it seems that Grand Archbishop Kasvado is also absent?"

<b>

"Grand Archbishop Kasvado is currently heading to the Ael Temple in Izumira, located on the border with Tobajion."

<b>

"This is Lord Goldberg, I apologize. However, it seems there is some urgent matter."

<b>

"Recently, it seems that temple was ransacked and sacred treasures were stolen."

<b>

"What! There must have been some disrespectful individuals involved."

<b>

"Indeed. It is believed to be the work of foreigners, but there have been several incidents in recent years. It might be time to reconsider the temple patrol plans."

<b>

"Dalton, is the Great Temple of Dekkenbel safe?"

<b>

"The Great Temple is located within the academy grounds, so it is not easy for unruly individuals to intrude. That is why Grand Archbishop Kasvado can leave Dekkenbel with peace of mind."

<b>

"I see, indeed, if it's within the academy, it can be entrusted without worry."

<b>

"However, Dekkenbel itself has been a bit unsettled lately."

<b>

"Lord Reinberger, has something happened?"

<b>

"It is a dispute among ruffians."

<b>

"As Codeweiner mentioned, since the beginning of this month, gang conflicts have continued in the old city. Most of the leaders of the new faction disappeared at the end of last month, leading to a resurgence of the old faction. While only the lower ranks are actually fighting and causing damage, the number of casualties has already exceeded three digits. It is not a number to be taken lightly. The body storage may overflow tonight. Reports indicate that capacity has already been exceeded."

<b>

"Thanks to that, the number of guards at this consulate has been deployed at more than double the usual amount... a naturally accepted flow."

<b>

"It serves as a good pretext for creating a cage."

<b>

The last conversation between Dalton and Bona was quiet, inaudible to those around them.

Then the two lightly clinked their glasses together.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

Hearing the faint conversation of Dalton and the others, Lawrence clicked his tongue softly.

The fools from Fluke's side continue to obstruct us at every turn.

<b>

"Father, I brought a replacement for your glass."

"Hmph."

<b>

His son, taller than Lawrence, slightly bent at the waist to match his father and offered the glass from below.

<b>

"What has become of that matter?"

"Proceeding smoothly."

"Here, watch for an opening and move as planned."

"Of course, I understand."

<b>

The recent destruction of Fluke's office.

The confidential documents and contracts stored in the safe there.

Anything that would directly cause me trouble is not kept there.

It is stored in a different location, one that cannot be breached without the knights' involvement.

<b>

However, while I may have scattered the minor documents, a few of them still certainly exist.

If there is something that could serve as evidence of my involvement, there is a significant possibility it could lead to trouble.

It would be better if Stearpike had taken them as my cards.

But if they remained in Fluke's office...

<b>

I was aware that the search of Fluke's office was conducted on a large scale, with the Amkam consulate providing a lot of manpower for it.

I also received information that the large amount of seized documents was temporarily gathered at this consulate for examination.

<b>

The current situation is extremely opaque.

If I act carelessly, I might give them an opening to exploit.

However, I cannot simply leave anything that could connect to my weaknesses unattended.

<b>

I contemplated infiltrating the Amkam consulate, but the strength of their defenses was extraordinary.

The risks of failure are far too great.

<b>

Yet this time, they have deliberately provided me with the opportunity to be invited into the consulate openly and without pretense.

<b>

Amkam is connected to McGavin, whom I am currently trying to oust.

<b>

They will likely be cautious of me, but at this time of year, with elections approaching next year, they cannot fail to send an invitation to the head residing in Dekkenbel for a party.

Naturally, the invited side must respond, or it would be unnatural.

<b>

<b>

Lawrence has been unable to gauge the true extent of Amkam's power.

The stories he hears are all absurd and seem too outlandish to take seriously.

<b>

However, the defensive capabilities of this consulate are indeed high. He understood this when he visited today.

The equipment is not at a guard level. It is undoubtedly knight-class. It is clear even to Lawrence that it is not something amateurs can handle.

<b>

It is certain that they are not an opponent to be taken lightly.

Now is not the time to increase adversaries unnecessarily. I should focus on solidifying my own position.

In about six months, I should be able to take Rienkanal.

By then, I will have secured the entire mining area.

Once that happens, the land and waterways east of Karais will be completely under my control.

<b>

There is no need to rush here.

<b>

...There is no need, but it is also not a matter to dismiss the possibility of being undermined.

Therefore, I will view this situation as an opportunity.

<b>

No matter how knight-class the defenses of the Amkam consulate may be, once I am inside, I can handle things with Van's power.

<b>

The ink used for signing contracts typically contains magical compounds.

This ensures that the signature does not disappear, records the signer's magical power, and allows for identification of that individual.

<b>

With Van's exceptional ability to detect magical power, he can trace even the faint magical traces recorded.

If there are documents with my signature, Van will surely find them.

<b>

This is one of the most useful pieces I possess.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Van had always been a child who stood out far above his peers since he was young. However, he also possessed a peculiar trait of not expressing his emotions on his face.

<b>

I don't remember when it happened or what triggered it, but there was a time when I struck him repeatedly with my cane.

Yet this child did not cry, merely enduring it with a blank expression.

Depending on how you look at it, he was a creepy child, but at that moment, I was certain: "This is a useful piece."

<b>

As expected, he proved to be exceptional. He finished nearly all his education at the top of his class, and even after I began to have him assist with work, he calmly handled the tasks at hand.

His ability to navigate matters to his advantage from a flat perspective, without involving emotions, greatly satisfied me.

<b>

However, there is one time when that icy expression changes. It is when he is mercilessly destroying an irretrievably weak individual.

At that moment alone, he reveals his emotions.

<b>

Even knowing his horrifying penchant for tormenting small beings who have no power or ability, until the very end, Lawrence's evaluation of him does not change.

Rather, he is easier to handle than those with normal sensibilities.

Such individuals often hesitate in their work, citing social or human concerns.

<b>

With Van, it is enough to allow that and simply provide the space.

In fact, he has already arranged a convenient environment for himself, creating situations to enjoy at his leisure. He is truly low-maintenance.

<b>

He is an exceptionally capable piece, without any trouble.

<b>

Since about five to six years ago, he has willingly taken on deeper work. Around this time, he mentioned that his research on techniques had surpassed a barrier.

He claimed that the precision of the techniques for leading negotiations favorably had significantly improved.

Speaking of which, it was around this time that Van brought in someone to organize the area around Hexagom.

<b>

Thanks to that, the time spent on preparations has greatly increased the number of moves I can make. In two to three years, I should be able to carve out a rough shape.

I cannot afford to fumble around in a place like this.

<b>

"Good, do not miss this opportunity. Search the estate for documents and confirm their presence. Dispose of them as soon as they are discovered."

"Leave it to me."

<b>

At Lawrence Niven's words, Van Niven deeply bowed his head.

At the same time, he raised his mouth into a horrifyingly deep and wide grin.
