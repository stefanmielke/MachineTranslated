# 182 Father and Son of the Niven Family

I understand you recently discovered some irregularities in the school's affairs?"

<blank>

A mouth full of rich mustache spoke the words to Dalton.

<blank>

His white blonde hair, which, like his mustache, has a slight habit, is parted evenly in the center and is naturally swept back as it is.

Although he is a mature man, the low-pitched voice emanating from his muscular body over six feet tall can be intimidating.

<blank>

However, the person who received these words was quite cool.

<blank>

It is my fault. I am currently working on a detailed investigation. Lord Goldberg."

<blank>

Dalton Banjo puts his hand on his chest, bows his head, and tells Robert Randall Goldberg so.

<blank>

As a member of the school's board of directors, I cannot overlook this incident. I hope that you will do everything in your power to speed up the investigation of this matter.

<blank>

Yes. We will be calling an emergency meeting of the Board of Directors this month. We hope you will be able to attend."

<blank>

"Yes. Yes, sir."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"-I can't let you get away with this, Sir, without getting into some liability issues. ......

<blank>

Such murmurs come from a group a short distance away.

Dalton looked over and saw Lawrence Niven, whose back was turned, shrug his shoulders slightly.

<blank>

I am certainly responsible for this! After all, when the matter is resolved, this is one place where I will step down from my position. ......"

<blank>

Wait, wait, wait, Dalton. No one is going to accept that kind of blame that suits you, okay?"

<blank>

You're right. Banjo, you should do your duty in your position."

<blank>

Ugh, Bona. To Lord Goldberg at ......."

<blank>

But I'm told it's all settled now."

<blank>

Yes, that's right, Lord Leinberger. We are very fortunate to have such a competent staff."

<blank>

Dalton replies to Cordwainer Reinberger, head of the De Kembel Magical Information Bureau, a good-natured-looking gentleman who rubs his chin and calls out to him.

<blank>

"Oh, it was Lord Cloud who helped you, wasn't it?"

<blank>

They've been really good and helpful."

<blank>

"Oh, that's very encouraging."

<blank>

Cordwainer Leinberger shook his chestnut hair, much like his son, and nodded with a soft smile.

<blank>

'Speaking of which, you don't seem to be able to see Old Manavidan, do you? That man, I don't think he would turn down a banquet. ......"

<blank>

One of his young apprentices is celebrating the completion of his first job today. He is going to attend the celebration. I heard that he will be on his way here at a suitable place.

<blank>

"Hmmm, you are the best master in De Kembel, aren't you?"

<blank>

Dalton: "Speaking of which, Dalton. I don't see you here, High Priestess Kasvado?"

<blank>

Lady Kasvad Fianna is now on her way to the Temple of Ael in Izmira, on the border with Tobazion.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Lord Goldberg, but you seem to be here at short notice. But what seems to be the urgency of the matter?"

<blank>

I heard that the temple was recently ransacked and its sacred treasures stolen."

<blank>

"My goodness! There are some who would be disrespectful."

<blank>

No," he said. They are probably from outside the country, but there have been a few incidents in the past few years. It may be time to rethink our temple patrol plan.

<blank>

Dalton, is the Great Temple of DeKembel safe?"

<blank>

The Great Temple is on the grounds of the school, so it is not so easy for the riffraff to break in. That is why Kasvad-sama, the head of the Great Temple, can leave Dekenberu with peace of mind.

<blank>

I see. I can certainly trust you in the academy.

<blank>

But DeKembel itself has been a bit unsettled of late.

<blank>

'Lord Leinberger. Is there something I can help you with?"

<blank>

It's a fight amongst the unreliable."

<blank>

As Cordwainer says, "There has been a lot of clique warfare going on in the old city center this month. Since most of the new force's leaders disappeared at the end of last month, we believe that this is happening because the old force is reeling. Only those on the fringe are actually suffering from the fighting, but the number of casualties has already exceeded three figures. It's not a foolproof number. The morgue may overflow tonight. Reports are coming in that the capacity has already been exceeded.

<blank>

Thanks to this, the number of security guards at this consulate is more than double what it normally is. It's a natural progression that everyone at ...... agrees on."

<blank>

So it's a good name for a cage."

<blank>

The last conversation between Dalton and Bona was small and inaudible from the surroundings.

Then they clink glasses lightly.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Lawrence was clucking his tongue at the faintly audible conversation of Dalton and the others.

Those idiots at Fluke's place will go to any lengths to get in our way.

<blank>

Father, I have a replacement glass for you."

"Humph."

<blank>

The son, taller than Lawrence, bent slightly at the waist to match his father and offered the glass in his hand from below.

<blank>

How did you handle that thing?"

"Without delay."

Now, look for an opening and follow the plan.

Of course I know.

<blank>

The recent destruction of the Fluke office.

A number of confidential documents and contracts stored in a safe there.

I don't let them store anything there that would be directly inconvenient to me.

I have them stored in a more separate place, a place where even the knights have to travel to break it down.

<blank>

However, although the documents of details were diffused, they were indeed present, albeit in a small amount.

If there is something there that could be evidence of your involvement, there is a good chance that it could lead to trouble.

It is still good if Steerpike took it as a handbill to himself.

But if you were still in Fluke's office, you can visit .......

<blank>

The search of Fluke's office was conducted on a large scale, and the fact that the Amcam consulate had provided a lot of manpower for it was gripping.

We are also informed that a large amount of confiscated documents are temporarily collected at the consulate for further inspection.

<blank>

The situation now is really uncertain.

If we make a bad move, we could give them an opening to take advantage of us.

But we can't just leave something that may lead to a weakness on our side.

<blank>

We even planned to break into the consulate of AMCAM, but the security of this place was not so strong.

The risk of failure is too great.

<blank>

This time, however, the other side was kind enough to give me the opportunity to invite them into the consulate in such a straightforward and dignified manner.

<blank>

Amcam has a connection to McGovern, whom he is now trying to oust.

<blank>

The other side may be wary of us, but if we hold a party at this time of year, with elections coming up next year, we cannot afford not to extend an invitation to the heads of state who are in De Kembel.

Naturally, the invited party must respond to the invitation, or it becomes unnatural.

<blank>

<blank>

How much power Amcam had, in fact, Lawrence had no idea at the bottom of it.

All of the stories I have heard are ridiculous and of a level that I am afraid to take seriously.

<blank>

However, this consulate is certainly well defended. I understood that when I visited here today.

The equipment is not at the level of a guard. It was definitely of the knightly class. It was clear to Lawrence that it was not something that an amateur could handle.

<blank>

There is no doubt that this is an opponent that cannot be antagonized carelessly.

We should not increase the number of opponents at this time. We should be working hard to solidify our foothold in the market.

Another six months and Lien Canal can be dropped.

By that time, we should have the entire mine area in our hands.

If this happens, the overland and waterways east of Calais will be completely under his control.

<blank>

There is no need to panic here.

<blank>

It's not ......, but it's also not a problem that can be dismissed as a possibility of being caught flat-footed.

So let's take this time as an opportunity.

<blank>

No matter how knightly class the Amkam consulate's protection is, once they are inside, Van's power will not matter.

<blank>

Inks used for signatures on contracts generally contain magical compounds.

The signature will not disappear, and it will be possible to record the magic power of the person who enters the signature and identify him or her.

<blank>

Van's superior ability to detect magic allows him to follow even the slightest trace of recorded magic.

If there is a document with your signature on it, Van will find it.

<blank>

This is one of the most useful pieces I have that jumps out at me.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

From an early age, Van was a child who excelled a head or two above his peers. However, he also had a peculiar side to him that he did not express on the surface.

<blank>

I don't remember when it was or what prompted me to do it, but I once struck with a stick I was holding, as if it were the best I could do.

The child, however, did not cry out, but simply continued to receive the treatment without any expression on his face.

A creepy looking kid to some, but Lawrence was convinced then and there. This is a piece I can use.

<blank>

As expected, he was excellent. He completed almost all of his education at the top of his class, and even after he was assigned to help out with work, he continued to work on the matters in front of him without hesitation.

Lawrence was very pleased with the way he worked, leading things to his advantage from a flat perspective, with no emotional involvement.

<blank>

But there is only one time when that icy look moves. It is when it irretrievably destroys the irresistible weak.

Only then does Kore reveal his emotions.

<blank>

Even after learning of his fearless propensity to take the time to violate a small being with no power or ability to resist to the very end, Lawrence's opinion of this man has not changed.

They are easier to deal with than those who have straight nerves.

These people often hesitate to do our work, saying that it is social or human.

<blank>

We just have to allow it to happen and give Kore the space to do it.

No, he has already set up a convenient environment for himself and created a situation where he can enjoy himself whenever he wants. It's really not that complicated.

<blank>

Totally hassle-free and an excellent piece.

<blank>

Around 5-6 years ago now, he began to do deep work on his own initiative. Around this time, he said, his research on jutsu also went over the wall.

He says that the accuracy of his art of leading negotiations to an advantage has improved dramatically.

Come to think of it, it was around this time that Van brought in the person who is now having the area around Hexagom organized.

<blank>

Thanks to the time spent on preparation, the number of hands has increased considerably, and we should be able to cut out most of the shapes in two or three years.

We can't afford to get bogged down in a place like this.

<blank>

Don't let this opportunity pass you by. Search the residence, see if there are any documents, and take care of them as soon as you find them."

Leave it to me."

<blank>

Van Niven bows deeply at Lawrence Niven's words.

At the same time, his mouth hung fearlessly, deeply and widely.
