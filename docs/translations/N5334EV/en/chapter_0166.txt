# 154 A Quake

I felt the earth shake.

It is as if a huge dragon is slowly advancing.

<blank>

It seems to be shaking the atmosphere.

The thud ...... thud ...... and the vibration gradually gets louder and louder.

Each time I do, I feel a big jump in my body.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

No, not .......

This is my body shaking. This is my body shaking.

Why on earth am I shaking? Am I shaking?

............ frightened?

<blank>

You say you are frightened?

What on earth are you scared of?

What happened to that feeling of omnipotence you had a moment ago? There is no need to be frightened.

<blank>

Boom! and the body jumps again.

<blank>

What the hell is going on?

What makes my body jump so much ......?

<blank>

Oh well, the body responds on its own.

They are trembling and frightened on their own.

These vibrations are the beats of my own heart.

My heart is beating horribly.

<blank>

I found myself sweating like a waterfall.

This is an instinctive fear.

A fear of something fundamental that cannot be controlled by one's reason.

<blank>

And then I noticed the presence there.

The moment I saw it, I suddenly understood that my soul was afraid.

<blank>

Fluke felt at that moment that the red jade light that shimmered around him was like sparks from the flames of rage that erupted from him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Wait, Susie! Calm down first."

What about?" What are you talking about, Irving? I'm calm.

Then you'd better control your killing spree!"

<blank>

Pardon me!

Irving, you are talking as if I am leaking murderous intent.

It was as if the area shook every time I walked!

I'm not that heavy!

<blank>

I don't care about that, Irving. What's this all about?

<blank>

I couldn't even speak at the sight of the devastation unfolding before my eyes. I am, but I am still speaking out.

<blank>

Why is Irving here, and why is this happening?"

<blank>

I saw the dog that had been growling near Karen trying to get up.

The waist is squishy and wriggling around. The wound seems to be regenerating.

Hmm? What is this guy? Is he going to jump on Karen?

<blank>

Why are you being so difficult to deal with?"

<blank>

I lightly turned my wrist and snapped my fingers at this guy.

As soon as the directional shockwave with strong Ki on it reaches this guy, the body of the magical beast pops like a water balloon.

<blank>

How could Karen, Miss Cordelia, and Annie have been hurt so badly?

<blank>

I felt my core grow cold.

Karen is the only one sitting conscious. No, that Karen is also barely conscious?

<blank>

Miss Lucille has both arms broken.

Miss Catherine's side is bleeding badly. This is going to damage her internal organs.

Miss Cordilia has a gouged shoulder and even a blue bruise on her beautiful face ....... And her fingers, broken?

And small animals? This one is terrible. Her heart is barely beating weakly, but it's about to stop.

Annie ....... Oh my god ...... how could this be so bad? It looks as if she's been kicked repeatedly. There's even blood around her mouth after she vomited blood.

Karen, the only person who remains conscious, is also terrible.

That sheltering right arm is broken. How many fingernails have been removed from that beautiful hand?

It seems to be damaging to my body. He's coughing ....... Any damage to the ribs or lungs?

<blank>

...... Irving!"

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

'Soo, Soo! Ha, Haggard, you're here to help!"

Why are you even injured? Are you going to fall behind your opponent like this? Aren't you sagging?"

"No face."

<blank>

I almost hit Irving too hard.

If Irving is as good as he seems to be, he should be able to handle an opponent of this caliber with ease.

So why not?

<blank>

But if you look closely, Irving is pretty damaged too.

In addition, you can visit .......

<blank>

I mean, why are you the only one in a poisoned state?"

What about? Poison?"

"You're in a highly poisonous trance, okay? Did you not know that?

'Is it the poison that's making me all queasy and dizzy from earlier?'

You were coughing up blood!"

"By any chance, ......, was that a close ......?"

<blank>

Irving was still Irving.

<blank>

Why is this guy so careless about his own body?

Do you know what Bibi is always lamenting?

Well, riders tend to be similar.

I wonder if all the people in Haggard's house are like that.

<blank>

I'm going to go to ...... and treat it all at once. I'll treat it all at once.

What? Treatment? All at once? What? Here?

We need to do something about these kids right now.

<blank>

The Field Greater Heel."

Furthermore.

Bright of Purge."

Centered on me, healing light spread throughout the alley.

Suddenly, everyone's injuries are fully healed.

<blank>

What? Soooo, awesome ......"

<blank>

When Karen sees that her peeled fingernails and broken arm are healed, she looks surprised and wriggles her hand with wide eyes.

<blank>

Bright of Purge" is to cure Irving's highly poisonous condition.

And Karen.

I don't know why, but this girl has a funny debuff on her.

<blank>

<blank>

"De, de, de, de! D-B-A-B-A-A-A-A!"

<blank>

Just when I thought I was relieved, some strange guy started screaming.

What is this guy? Is he human?

Hmm? DeGrayed Man? Isn't that the ...... guy? Are you saying that these are the hexenbiests I've been tracking?

<blank>

I don't know what it is, but I was thinking that half of the ten magical beast reactions I detected, five of them were gathered here, and two of them were humanoid?

I should have been more aware of the reaction of the hexenbiest.

<blank>

<blank>

But I'm pretty sure that these are the same people who did this to my kids.

But still, you can go to .............

<blank>

"Oh, no!"

<blank>

The guy from earlier comes barreling in, screaming something.

It's so noisy! I don't even understand what they are saying!

One of the dogs was coming toward us, so I kicked it toward that "failure.

<blank>

Pappe!"

<blank>

A kicking dog hits this guy at a speed faster than sound.

The dog flew straight away and joined that guy and hit the front wall and bounced off.

Results.

The fusion of what looks like a person and what looks like a dog will result in an object that is so unpleasant.

<blank>

He's in such a state, but he's still moving around, saying "Gebi Gebi" and stuff.

It's really gross. I'll burn it later.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suddenly, I noticed that the sword blade had fallen at my feet.

I pick it up with a thud.

It is a short, wooden mock sword.

<blank>

This is a piece of a wooden sword that Annie was happy to be allowed to belt.

I picked it up and wrapped it in my hand, and I could feel Annie's ch'i wrapping around it.

<blank>

You fought with this one, Annie.

I can't believe I was even able to do that before I knew it. ......

That's great, Annie. I'll give you lots of praise later.

<blank>

Carefully and quietly, he put his "Ki" into the Soret in his hand.

He then picks it up with his fingertips as if he were holding a conductor's baton, and with the tip of the baton, he cuts the wind in fine, quick strokes.

The "Ki" that she was clad in instantly sliced apart the demonic beast that was about to turn on Miss Cordelia and the others.

<blank>

Her paws seemed to be regenerating, but there was no way I would have missed it, aiming at a girl right after her regeneration!

<blank>

<blank>

I've had to dispose of many of the same kind before I came here, and the quickest way to dispose of them is to cut them up or blow them up like this.

<blank>

They are not very strong, but they have a great regenerative ability.

I was curious as to why it regenerated so much, so I read deeply into the etheric information of one of them and noticed that a strange one was in its body.

What would you call it? There was this ...... ouzo ouzo, mozomoso, myriad wriggling entities all over my body.

Parasites? Like what?

Is he a dog with regenerating bugs all over his body? Is he an infinite dog? I wanted to poke him in the eye.

<blank>

I thought that if I could destroy only the bugs, they would not be able to regenerate, so I tried it.

<blank>

What I tried was an anomaly in "Impact Blaster".

It's been tried and true for a long time.

It is not a surface attack like "Impact Storm" or "Impulse Burst" which can attack a range, but an attack on multiple points.

<blank>

After all, with this ranged attack, if there are other allies in the range besides the enemy, they will be damaged as well!

If we were in a melee in a PT group, it would be too dangerous to use.

<blank>

So I've been developing this as one of my skill controls to see if I could hit multiple targeted points.

<blank>

Thanks to this, I can now tag more than one being at a time if I concentrate.

This time, I was able to hit hundreds of tags in the dog's body.

<blank>

Maybe if I concentrate more, I'll get a feel for how to raise the number of targets by several orders of magnitude. ......, but to be honest, it's quite tiring. I don't want to do it too much.

I don't think it's that common to be dealing with thousands and thousands of people!

<blank>

I was able to use my skills this time to destroy all those wriggling around inside the dog.

<blank>

As a result, we were able to kill the dog without regenerating it, but it looked like a badly shredded rag.

Wouldn't it be easier to just cut it off or blow it up from the start? Isn't that just tiring and the worst cosmetics?

That is how we came to this conclusion.

<blank>

So, the best way to deal with these guys is to cut them up roughly, or blow them up, or ....... Other than that, I think the right way to deal with them is to stain the walls. Duh.

<blank>

Oh, and maybe we can use it as charcoal extinguisher.

However, I can't really recommend it in the city, because if a burning magical beast were to run around, it would be quite a problem.

<blank>

<blank>

So, there is only one ...... left in the place, or one of them.

I turn my attention to that last one.

<blank>

Is it you, ......, who did this to my Annie?"

"Ji-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!"

Stop the noise."

<blank>

He swings the piece of wooden sword in his hand again.

With a fine wind-cutting sound, Ki's blades cut through the limbs and torso of this guy.

<blank>

At the same time, the wooden sword in his hand falls to pieces.

The strength of the material could not withstand the Ki I put into it.

Oh, and by the way, the sword that Irving had was badly mangled. ......

I can think of a few things. ......

<blank>

After all this time, it's still important to have equipment that can withstand my power.

I'll talk to your uncle about Irving's equipment later.

<blank>

I told you, didn't I?

<blank>

He looks very different, but he is probably the same Fluke I beat up last night.

He was definitely a human last night, but now his race name is already "DeGrayed Man" like the guy from earlier.

What in the world has happened in the last few hours?

<blank>

I have no idea, but I honestly don't care about that.

<blank>

The next time he appears in front of Karen, he'll pull his head off ---- and..."

<blank>

The limbs and chest down were scattered, turning into pieces of dismembered flesh.

From the head down, the remaining head, now a bust, falls into the sea of flesh and blood that he has scattered.

<blank>

Aba gyabo gyabo hgy gyabo gw----!!!"

<blank>

The man jumps around in a sea of blood, spitting out incomprehensible noises from his mouth.

Really, it's seriously fearless to be able to move around in this condition!

<blank>

I held him with my foot and squeezed his skull.

The iron claw is done with great care so that it does not go squishy in the hand due to excessive force!

<blank>

"Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! Giiiiiiiiiidee! "Gee-dee-dee-dee!"

<blank>

But this filth makes a loud noise about itty-bitty pain.

I am so worried about you! I've been taking such good care of you!

What do you think my consideration is? How can you be so insensitive?

<blank>

When I look at this guy, I feel like I'm being confronted with my own naivete.

There is no doubt that I missed this guy last night, and that is why Annie, Karen, and Miss Cordelia are in such a bad way today.

Those beings who harm others with impunity should be dealt with on the spot without hesitation.

I thought I had learned it well at AMCAM, but I was the one who was slackened by the atmosphere in the city. I can't blame Irving.

I shudder to think if I had come a little later.

I am utterly disgusted with my own warmth.

<blank>

Just listening to him yelling as usual, I was getting more and more pissed off, so I just slammed him against the wall in front of me.

<blank>

Gosh!

<blank>

With a tremendous bang, he flew through the wall and flew straight through a few houses.

Zzzzzz ...... and the houses in front of it are collapsing.

<blank>

Stone walls are more fragile than flesh?

Is this guy's body much tougher than the guy and the dog from earlier?

It's kind of like a natural disaster that happened to the houses. ......

<blank>

Oh, no! He did it! I told you to calm down!

What? What? What? What is this?

<blank>

I kind of thought I heard Irving and Karen's voices, but ......, oh well.

<blank>

Zgogogogogo, through the dusty debris, and continue on to the one that flew away.

<blank>

He made a long crater that looked like it had been dug up and buried in the middle of the street at the river's edge.

Already, right in front of us is the Maguarat River.

<blank>

I grabbed him by the head, which was buried in the ground, and dragged him outside.

<blank>

"......aa, gape, gopaa ......"

<blank>

When I grabbed its head and let it dangle, the ouzo wriggled and wriggled all over its body, trying to regenerate its flesh.

It's really gross! The immortality of the body is also quite disgusting.

But you can also visit ......!

<blank>

Since the time of mythology, there has been a formula for dealing with immortal opponents."

I'm going to go to "Aga? kepe......"

Burn! Ignis Flame!"

<blank>

For single attack, continuous damage skill for the divination magic job "Arc Wizard".

<blank>

If the magic power is too large, it will burn up in an instant, so the magic is activated by thinning the minute amount of magic power to such an extent that it will burn up in an instant.

<blank>

'Ng aaaaaaaghgiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. --------！！！！！！"

<blank>

A small magical fire, which will never be extinguished until the caged magic power is exhausted, burns the flesh after which it is regenerated alive.

<blank>

He tossed this guy, who was on fire, back onto the gouged out ground.

With a fearless cry, the black smoke of burning flesh rises slowly, like a wolfsbane, toward the autumn sky of Dekenbel.
