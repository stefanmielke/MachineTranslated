# Chapter 154: Tremor

I felt the earth shake heavily.

It was as if a gigantic dragon was slowly advancing.

<b>

It seemed to be shaking the very atmosphere.

The vibrations gradually grew stronger, thudding… thudding…

With each tremor, I felt my body jump.

<b>

<b>

<b>

No… that's not it.

It's my own body that's shaking. It's trembling.

Why on earth am I shaking? Trembling?

…Am I afraid?

<b>

Am I really saying that I'm afraid?

What on earth am I afraid of?

What happened to the omnipotence I felt just a moment ago? There's no reason to be afraid.

<b>

My body jolted again with a thud!

<b>

What on earth is going on?!

Why is my body jumping like this…?

<b>

I see, my body is reacting on its own.

It's trembling and shaking involuntarily.

This vibration is the pounding of my heart.

My heart is beating terrifyingly fast.

<b>

Before I knew it, sweat was flowing down like a waterfall.

This is a primal fear.

A fear of something fundamental that I cannot control with my reason.

<b>

And then, I became aware of the presence that was there.

The moment I saw it, I suddenly understood that my soul was afraid.

<b>

Fluke felt at that moment that the being scattering the light of the ruby was like the sparks of a fiery rage erupting.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Wait, Suzy! First, calm down.”

“Huh? What are you talking about, Arvin? I am calm, okay?”

“Then suppress that killing intent!”

<b>

How rude!

That Arvin, saying that I’m leaking killing intent everywhere.

As if the ground shakes every time I walk!

I’m not that heavy!

<b>

“More importantly, Arvin. What is going on here?”

<b>

I was at a loss for words at the horrific scene before me. No, I was speaking.

<b>

“Why is Arvin here, and why is this happening?”

<b>

I noticed a dog that had been groaning near Karen trying to get up.

Its waist was squirming and writhing. It seemed its wounds were regenerating.

Huh? What’s this guy? Is it planning to pounce on Karen?

<b>

“Why are you struggling against something like this?”

<b>

I lightly flicked my wrist and snapped my fingers at it.

The strong shockwave infused with ‘ki’ hit it, and the beast’s body burst like a water balloon.

<b>

“Why are Karen, Lady Cordelia, and even Annie, so badly injured?”

<b>

I felt the core of my body growing cold.

Only Karen was sitting there, barely maintaining consciousness. No, even she was just barely holding on, right?

<b>

Lady Lucille had both arms broken.

Lady Catherine was bleeding heavily from her side. This could damage her internal organs.

Lady Cordelia had her shoulder flesh gouged out, and her beautiful face was bruised… Were her fingers broken too?

Even the small animal? This poor thing is in a terrible state. Its weak little heart is barely beating, but it looks like it will stop soon.

Annie… What happened… How did it come to this? It looks like she’s been kicked multiple times. There’s even blood at her mouth.

Even Karen, who was the only one maintaining consciousness, looked terrible.

That right arm she was protecting is broken. Were the nails of that beautiful hand torn off?!

It seems she has damage to her body too. She’s coughing… Are her ribs or lungs injured?

<b>

“…Arvin!”

“I’m sorry. I was inadequate.”

“S-Su-chan! H-Haggard-kun came to help!”

“Why are you injured too? Falling behind against something like this? Are you slacking off?”

“I’m sorry.”

<b>

I almost lashed out at Arvin.

With his abilities, he should have been able to handle an opponent like this easily.

So why?!!

<b>

But looking closely, Arvin also seemed to have taken considerable damage.

On top of that…

<b>

“...By the way, why are you the only one poisoned?”

“Huh? Poison?”

“You’re in a state of severe poisoning, you know? Didn’t you realize that?”

“Is that why I’ve been feeling nauseous and dizzy since earlier?”

“You were even vomiting blood!”

“Could it be… I was in danger…?”

<b>

Arvin was still Arvin.

<b>

Why is he so oblivious to his own body?

Doesn’t he understand why Bibi always complains?!

Speaking of which, Rider seems to have a similar tendency.

Is everyone in Haggard’s family like that?

<b>

“...It can't be helped. I’ll heal you all at once.”

“Huh? Heal? All at once? Here?!”

“I need to do something about these kids right away.”

<b>

『Field Greater Heal』

Furthermore.

『Bright of Purge』

A healing light spread throughout the alley centered on me.

In an instant, it completely healed everyone’s injuries.

<b>

“Huh? A-amazing…”

<b>

When Karen confirmed that her torn nails and broken arms were healing, she opened her eyes wide in surprise and started to wiggle her hands.

<b>

『Bright of Purge』 was to cure Arvin’s severe poisoning.

And Karen.

I don’t know why, but this girl seems to have some strange debuff on her.

<b>

<b>

“D-deme! D-deme baaaan!!”

<b>

Just when I thought I could breathe easy, a strange guy started shouting.

What is this guy? Is he human?

Huh? “Degraded Man”? …Not human? Is this what the beasts I detected were?

<b>

I thought that half of the ten beast reactions I detected were gathered here, and it turns out two of them were humanoid?

I should have paid more attention to the beast reactions.

<b>

<b>

But these guys are definitely the ones who put my kids through hell, without a doubt.

Still…….

<b>

“Shut up.”

<b>

While shouting something, the previous guy charged in.

It was so noisy! I couldn’t understand what he was saying at all!

I noticed a dog was also coming towards me, so I kicked that “failure” away.

<b>

“Pakyoppe!”

<b>

The dog I kicked collided with it at a speed that broke the sound barrier.

The dog flew and crashed into the wall in front, bursting apart.

As a result.

A creature that looked like a human and a dog fused together, creating a truly disgusting object.

<b>

Even in that state, it was still moving around, making “gepi gepi” sounds.

Really gross. I’ll burn it later.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, I noticed a blade lying at my feet.

I picked it up gently.

It was a short, wooden practice sword.

<b>

This was a fragment of the wooden sword that Annie had been so happy to be allowed to wear.

As I held it in my hand, I could faintly feel Annie’s ki surrounding it.

<b>

So you fought with this, Annie.

I can’t believe you’ve become capable of such things without me noticing…

You’re amazing, Annie. I’ll praise you a lot later.

<b>

I carefully infused “ki” into it.

Then, I pinched it as if holding a conductor’s baton and swiftly cut the air with the tip.

The infused “ki” instantly sliced through the beast that was about to attack Lady Cordelia.

<b>

It seemed its front legs were regenerating, but there was no way I would let it target a girl right after regenerating!

<b>

<b>

By the way, I had disposed of several of its kind before coming here, but cutting them up like this or making them explode is the quickest way to deal with them.

<b>

They’re not particularly strong, yet their regeneration ability is incredibly high.

I was curious about why they regenerate so much, and when I delved into the ether information of one of them, I noticed something strange inside its body.

What can I say? There were countless wriggling entities all over its body.

Parasites? Something like that?

Are they keeping regeneration worms all over their body? An infinite dog?! I felt like saying that.

<b>

So, I thought if I could just crush those worm-like things, they wouldn’t be able to regenerate, and I decided to try it.

<b>

What I tried was a variant of “Impact Blaster.”

I had been experimenting with it for a while.

Instead of area attacks like “Impact Storm” or “Impulse Burst,” which could hit allies in a chaotic battle, I aimed for multiple points.

<b>

With area attacks, if there are allies within the range, they would take damage too!

When in a party and things get chaotic, it’s dangerous to use them.

<b>

So I had been developing a way to hit multiple targeted points as one of my skill controls.

<b>

Thanks to that, now I can target multiple entities at once when I concentrate.

This time, I was able to hit several hundred targets within the dog’s body.

<b>

If I concentrate even more, I feel like I could increase the number of targets I can hit by several orders of magnitude… but honestly, it’s quite tiring. I don’t want to do it too much.

After all, I don’t think I’ll often face thousands or tens of thousands of targets!

<b>

This time, using my skill, I was able to crush all the wriggling things inside the dog.

<b>

As a result, I managed to take it down without allowing it to regenerate, but it looked like a horrible, tattered rag.

Wouldn’t it have been easier to just cut it up or make it explode from the start? It was exhausting, and the cost-effectiveness was terrible, right?

That’s what I realized.

<b>

So, for dealing with these guys, cutting them up or making them explode… I think that’s the correct way to handle them. Yup.

<b>

Oh, and turning them into charcoal might be an option too.

But if a burning beast runs around in the city, it could cause quite a problem, so I can’t really recommend it.

<b>

<b>

With that said, there’s only one more left… no, one beast left.

I turned my gaze to that last one.

<b>

“Was it you who did this to my Annie…?”

“J-jidanagadda, ah, ahndano, miudidanangda!!”

“Stop spewing noise.”

<b>

I swung the piece of the wooden sword in my hand again.

With the sound of slicing wind, the ki blade shredded its limbs and torso.

<b>

At the same time, the wooden sword in my hand crumbled and fell apart.

The material couldn’t withstand the ki I infused.

Oh, speaking of which, the sword Arvin had was also in terrible condition…

I had a feeling that I should have thought of that…

<b>

It’s a bit late now, but having equipment that can withstand my power is important.

I’ll consult with my uncle about Arvin’s equipment later.

<b>

“I told you, didn’t I?”

<b>

Though its appearance has changed significantly, this is probably the Fluke I beat up last night.

It should have definitely been human last night, yet now its species name has changed to “Degraded Man,” just like the previous one.

What on earth happened in these few hours?

<b>

I have no idea, but honestly, I don’t care.

<b>

“If you appear before Karen again, I’ll rip your head off――――”

<b>

Its limbs and chest turned into scattered chunks of flesh and flew apart.

The remaining head and torso, now resembling a bust, fell into the sea of blood and flesh it had created.

<b>

“Abagiyabogiyahgiygobg――――！！！"

<b>

While spewing incomprehensible sounds from its mouth, it flailed around in the sea of blood.

Seriously, being able to move around in that state is truly horrifying!

<b>

I pressed down on the writhing creature with my foot and gripped its skull tightly.

I made sure not to crush it with too much force while applying my iron claw!

<b>

“Giiigya! Igiiyiiid! Iidiiidii!”

<b>

Yet this filth was loudly screaming in pain.

Seriously! Even though I’m being so considerate!

What does it think my consideration is?! It’s incredibly insensitive, isn’t it?!

<b>

Looking at it makes me feel like I’m being confronted with my own softness.

There’s no doubt that by letting this guy go last night, I caused Annie, Karen, and Lady Cordelia to suffer such terrible fates today.

An existence that can harm others without hesitation should be dealt with on the spot without hesitation.

I should have firmly ingrained that in me through Amukamu, yet I had relaxed in the atmosphere of the city. I can’t blame Arvin.

I shudder to think what would have happened if I had been even a little later.

I’m utterly disgusted with my own softness.

<b>

Just listening to this guy’s screams was making me more and more irritated, so I slammed him against the wall in front of me.

<b>

BAM!

<b>

With a tremendous sound, it broke through the wall and flew through several houses.

The houses in front began to crumble with a sound like “zuzuzuzuzu…”

<b>

Huh? Is the stone wall weaker than flesh?

Is this guy’s body much sturdier than the previous ones and the dog?

It looks like a disaster has struck the houses…

<b>

“Uwah! You did it! That’s why I told you to calm down!”

“Huh? Huh?! What? What is this?!”

<b>

I thought I heard Arvin and Karen’s voices, but… well, whatever.

<b>

I moved through the dust and rubble to where the guy had flown.

<b>

He had created a long crater as if it had been dug up and was buried in the middle of the street by the river.

Right in front of me was the Magu Rat River.

<b>

I gripped the head of the guy buried in the ground and dragged him out.

<b>

“...Ah, gape, gopa…”

<b>

When I grabbed his head and hung it, countless wriggling entities were squirming all over its body, trying to regenerate its flesh.

This is seriously gross! I’m utterly amazed by its immortal body.

But…!

<b>

“There’s a method to deal with immortals since the mythological era.”

“Ah? Kepe…”

“Burn! ‘Ignis Flame’!”

<b>

A single-target, continuous damage skill of the divine magic class “Arc Wizard.”

<b>

Since too much magical power would burn it up instantly, I finely tuned the magic to a very small amount to cast the spell.

<b>

“Ngahhhhhh――――――――――――――――――――――――――！！！！！！”

<b>

The small flame of magic, which would never extinguish until the infused magical power ran out, charred its flesh while it was still alive, burning it from behind as it tried to regenerate.

<b>

I threw the guy engulfed in flames back onto the gouged ground.

With a horrifying scream, the black smoke from the burning flesh slowly rose into the autumn sky of Dekember.
