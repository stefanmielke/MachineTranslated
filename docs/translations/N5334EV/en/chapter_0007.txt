# Episode 07: Suzy and the White Mountain Range

The altitude had already exceeded 8,000 meters.

However, the equipment was still just a single fur coat.

<b>

(So, Everest has temperatures around minus 30, right? I guess you need an oxygen mask too, but really... With this light gear at an altitude comparable to Everest! If a mountaineer heard about this, they’d probably say, 'Are you kidding me?!' But it's a dream, after all! It's a stable dream quality!!)

<b>

It was nice and easy! … or so I thought.

<b>

<b>

"However... I feel like the mobs are getting bigger as we get closer to the summit."

<b>

I had taken down quite a number of mobs from the place where the gatekeeper was to here.

Now, I had downgraded my gear from level A to D.

<b>

<b>

D gear consisted of a white half-plate armor.

<b>

The throat guard, shoulder guards, chest guard, shin guards, and gauntlets were adorned with white plates, and beneath the waist skirt made of thick leather, my white thighs peeked out, dazzling when I moved.

<b>

The chest area was also open, revealing a tantalizing glimpse of my twin peaks.

<b>

My weapon was a one-handed sword called the Generation Sword.

As usual, I held two of them in both hands.

<b>

The thick blade with a robust grip and large cross guard protruded forward like spikes, intricately engraved with reliefs.

<b>

<b>

"After dropping the weapon rank to D, it stopped exploding... but it still finishes in one hit! That 'Frost Dragon' earlier was huge, yet its head came off easily... And the 'Frost Giant' before that? It was about 18 meters tall, roughly the same size as what I saw in Odaiba. But this one was also easily sliced in half with a swift strike..."

<b>

I tapped the belly of the sword in my right hand against my shoulder, murmuring to no one in particular.

<b>

"Everything here is still bright blue, huh? I guess they're stronger than those below, but... I can't tell the difference anymore!"

<b>

As I climbed the mountainside, I muttered to myself in resignation.

<b>

The summit was right in front of me.

With Suzy's physical abilities, I could probably reach it in a single leap.

Before reaching the peak, I stopped, turned around, and gazed down at the world from an altitude exceeding 9,000 meters.

<b>

"Wow, at this height, the horizon looks round... It's incredible! This view is something you can only reach in a dream... a sight you can't see otherwise."

<b>

Below me, the mountain range extended to the forest where I had been just the day before yesterday.

It was indeed vast.

I could see it stretching far to the south.

The horizon was shrouded in a sea of clouds, and I could barely make out the end of the forest.

However, far beyond the forest, I could just about discern a flatland where people might live.

<b>

This vast forest had spots that looked like they were hollowed out, as if eaten away by insects, revealing open areas.

There were probably lakes or wetlands somewhere.

Considering the distance, it must be a pretty large lake... I thought as I looked.

<b>

Further to the west, the mountain range and forest continued endlessly into the distance.

However, I could see a river cutting through the forest, flowing south.

Even from this distance, it was clear that it was a significant river.

<b>

In the eastern direction, I could see the end of the forest.

Was it 100 kilometers ahead? I could see the ocean spreading out.

Above it, there seemed to be cumulonimbus clouds. It looked like clouds were rising from the sea.

<b>

With a deep sigh, I took a moment to immerse myself in this hazy, vibrant view, captivated by the world.

<b>

<b>

"…Now then."

<b>

How much time had I been standing there?

I shifted my gaze from the world below and turned my body towards the mountain, narrowing my eyes.

<b>

"They're there, aren't they... on the other side."

<b>

With that, I leaped up, digging into the mountainside, and jumped straight to the summit.

Upon reaching the peak, I immediately directed my gaze downward.

What spread out before me was the white world behind the mountain range.

A world purely white, so clear that it felt devoid of any traces of life, in stark contrast to the vast world brimming with vitality behind me.

<b>

"…Incredible, it's like this mountain range is hiding something behind it."

<b>

<b>

Beyond the altitude of 9,000 meters, an immense caldera rim stretched endlessly to the east and west.

Deep within lay the outer rim of a massive, bowl-shaped caldera.

<b>

The distance to the caldera's edge was about 10 kilometers from here.

The diameter of the caldera's outer rim was more than double that, easily exceeding 20 kilometers.

<b>

On the other side of that outer rim, mountains of the same height towered.

To the east and west.

As if to cover this caldera.

<b>

And in the center of that caldera, which was shaped like a bowl...

<b>

<b>

"…There it is."

<b>

Suzy crossed her arms and murmured while looking down at the center.

<b>

"I've come this far, there's no option to not go see... It’s likely a raid, but as long as I don’t engage, I should be fine... or was that just because it was a game? Either way, I have to get to a point where I can see it! I've come all this way... If it looks dangerous, I’ll just run away immediately!!"

<b>

I muttered to myself as if making a final confirmation.

<b>

<b>

"There are still quite a few mobs along the way, so let’s get through them quickly!"

<b>

With a light kick, I pushed off the summit and leaped into the air.

I skillfully slid down the snowy slope as if skiing, using only the soles of my feet.

<b>

On this side of the mountain, what lay before me was a monochromatic white world of snow and rock.

I slid and jumped forward.

<b>

Suddenly, the snow ahead began to bulge, like a mole's tunnel, as something approached me.

In the next moment, a long, massive creature burst through the snow with great force.

<b>

<b>

The 'Polar Worm,' a gigantic worm-like creature over 30 meters long and 1 meter thick.

At its front, it had sharp, gigantic mandibles like a stag beetle.

<b>

The Polar Worm opened its mandibles wide and charged straight at Suzy, trying to tear her apart.

<b>

Just before contact, Suzy jumped forward, twisting her body sideways and spinning like a top.

The blade in her hand sliced vertically through the Polar Worm's body.

<b>

The white giant split apart, scattering blue bodily fluid as it sank into the white earth.

<b>

Upon landing, Suzy continued to run as if nothing had happened.

<b>

<b>

"Huh, now it’s a pack? The 'Great White Hound' and 'White Fenrir,' that must be the boss."

<b>

Each creature was about 7 to 8 meters long, while the boss was nearly twice that size.

The pack of about eight surrounded Suzy, encircling her around the boss.

<b>

(It looks like something a princess would ride. The charging power is like that of a rhino or hippo.)

<b>

With a deep breath, I leaped into the air.

Using my outstretched arms as an axis, I rotated my body forward, flying towards the Fenrir positioned behind me in a graceful arc.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The Fenrir momentarily lost sight of its prey due to Suzy's swift leap, but quickly realized that she was coming from above.

<b>

If it was coming from that direction, it was just right; it would leap up to match the timing and catch her with its fangs.

The Fenrir thought this and timed its leap, baring its fangs.

<b>

Suzy easily dodged those fangs, stepping on its snout and landing behind it.

The Fenrir, with its snout stepped on, was slammed down to the ground.

<b>

Meanwhile, the pack, having missed their target, hurriedly turned back towards the Fenrir.

<b>

Suzy positioned herself perfectly behind the Fenrir, preparing to unleash a skill aimed at the front.

She lightly spread her legs and lowered her waist, extending both hands forward, pointing the tips at the target.

<b>

"I'll carve you up! Biiiiiito!!!"

<b>

≪Impulse Burst≫

A skill of the 'Duel Barbarian.'

It shoots out sword energy in front of her, a close-range area attack skill that targets multiple enemies.

<b>

With a swift motion, she opened her swords horizontally behind her, cutting through the space ahead.

The shockwave that spread from the opened sword tips instantly sliced through the Fenrir and the pack of White Hounds.

<b>

Suzy glanced at the blood and flesh splattering across the white snowfield before immediately running off.

<b>

She encountered several lizard-like and insect-like mobs along the way, but mostly dealt with them while passing by.

Eventually, after running for about five minutes, she reached the foot of the outer rim and quickly dashed up to the ridge.

<b>

"There are no mobs inside except for that one... Next time, I need to prepare properly before going in."

<b>

Saying this, she switched her gear from D to G Zero.

<b>

Wearing dark green heavy armor and a pale pink cape.

She held a rugged sword that discharged electricity in both hands.

<b>

Then she began to self-enchant, enhancing her abilities.

<b>

"I have plenty of top-tier healing potions, over 100 Phoenix Drops, and emergency escape scrolls for when things get tough! Alright! Snacks are limited to 500 yen! Bananas don’t count as snacks! The expedition lasts until I return! Alright, let’s go!!"

<b>

She leaped off the ridge and started running towards the center of the white caldera.

<b>

Jumping, running, and descending the inner side of the caldera, which was almost like a cliff.

As she kicked up snow dust while racing down, she soon caught sight of it.

<b>

(...It's looking this way, right? That thing isn’t an object. It definitely noticed me from beyond the mountain.)

<b>

<b>

Now that targeting was possible, I could finally confirm its name.

<b>

('Cocytus Dragon Kaina'? Whoa, there are several others too! What color is it... yellow? That would put it around level 100, I guess? That's a bit iffy. I wonder if I could take on a normal mob? ...No way! This one definitely looks like a boss or a raid. If it's a raid, I’d lose even against a pale blue one, right? I should probably just land a hit for the record and then run away... But still, it’s huge!)

<b>

I had already closed the distance to about 100 meters, and I could see its size clearly.

<b>

(Did super-sauruses look like this?)

<b>

It was approximately 40 meters long.

Its neck was long like a sauropod, and its limbs were thick and powerful like those of an elephant or rhinoceros.

<b>

Its entire body was as white as snow, covered in scales that resembled ice or crystal, casting a deep blue shadow in the light.

Two pairs of wings sprouted from its back. The four bat-like membranes were slightly bluish.

From its head, thick horns twisted like those of a goat, extending long towards the back.

Its face was adorned with countless spikes, glistening like icicles.

<b>

<b>

<b>

As I approached within about 50 meters, I moved slowly, trying to gauge its alertness.

It lay on the ground as if sleeping, but I could see its eyes slightly open, peering at me.

<b>

At 40 meters, it exhaled through its nostrils.

<b>

At 30 meters, it turned its jaw towards me.

<b>

At 20 meters, it lifted its jaw from the ground, facing me with its golden eyes wide open.

<b>

(...This is it, this line is the battle point.)

<b>

A tremor echoed through the ground, likely from this dragon.

<b>

"Child of power, you who stand before me, worthy of strength."

<b>

(Woah, it spoke!? Can it communicate?)

<b>

"Endure my trial and demonstrate your power."

<b>

With that, it slowly rose, tilting its head upward, and I could see its throat swelling.

<b>

"!!!?? Yikes!!"

<b>

In an instant, I switched from dual swords to a shield.

A large shield appeared on my left arm.

<b>

"What the?!"

<b>

≪Fledge of Guardian≫

A skill of the shield class 'Sentinel Knight.'

It increases shield defense by 2,000, magic and physical defense by 250%, and evasion rate and speed by 80%, specializing in shield defense.

<b>

I raised the enormous shield, resembling a long kite shield, and forcefully thrust its sharp edge into the ground.

<b>

Immediately after, a torrent of white light surged toward me.

The dragon's powerful breath carved through the surrounding snowfield.

However, it could not reach Suzy, blocked by the shield.

<b>

"Is it going to be like this again!? I was kind of hoping we could talk this time!!"

(?! No damage? Is it just a warning? Is it observing me?)

<b>

The white light faded.

Suzy seized the opportunity.

With her sword still in hand, she thrust her right fist toward the dragon and shouted.

<b>

"Here I go, I'm gonna do it!!!"

<b>

≪Magic Break≫

A skill of the magic attack class 'Arc Wizard.'

It destroys the target's magical defense and deals magical damage.

This is a staple skill for magic classes.

<b>

The sound of shattering glass echoed across the snowfield.

A magic circle, torn like a spider's web, appeared around the dragon, melting away into nothingness.

<b>

"Gaahh!?!" 

<b>

The dragon recoiled, and I could see its white scales shimmering like ice shards as they scattered.

It then slowly fell to the ground, shaking the earth and kicking up snow.

<b>

"Wait?! What? Why? Why? Huh? Did it fall??"

<b>

I was taken aback by how easily the dragon had fallen.

<b>

But then, the dragon lifted its head and jaw, raising its body.

<b>

"…Nn, muuh…"

<b>

"Was that a feint!? I knew it, there’s no way it would be that easy."

<b>

I gathered my strength again.

<b>

"Then how about this?!"

(I haven't switched to my staff, but that's okay for now! ...After I cast this, I’ll run!)

<b>

I raised my right hand high, then swung it down forcefully while shouting.

<b>

"Take this! Feel it!!!"

<b>

≪Mars Inferno≫

A high-level fire attack skill of the 'Arc Wizard.'

It releases ultra-high-temperature flames reaching tens of thousands of degrees, compressed to an extreme density.

This is the magic skill with the highest fire attribute attack power.

<b>

<b>

<b>

It happened in an instant.

<b>

<b>

Above the dragon, a small sun-like brilliance appeared just a few meters above it, and in the next moment...

<b>

The ground dissolved along with the dragon.

The explosion caused by the ultra-high pressure at high altitude produced an extraordinary destructive force.

<b>

The plasma generated from the released high-density flames grew even larger due to the low air pressure, eroding the earth.

The devastating shockwave blew away snow and earth like dust.

The ridge of the outer rim was mostly scraped away, and the outer mountain range crumbled and flew away.

Clouds were blown away along with the atmosphere, and the violent winds swept across the ground, knocking down trees over a wide area.

<b>

Having lost the ground beneath her feet in an instant, Suzy was helplessly swept away by the blast and was blown away.

<b>

"Wh-what!? Bwah! Gah! Ouch! What the?!"

<b>

She slammed into the ground, was blown away, and continued to dig into the earth.

<b>

Her body was hurled all the way to the outer mountain range.

Even as she dug into the mountainside, she couldn’t slow down, and she was thrown out over the mountain peak.

<b>

"Ugh! What the?! Gah! Huh?! Ouch?!"

<b>

She bounced off rocks and tumbled down for 400 to 500 meters.

<b>

"Whoa! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! What the?!"

<b>

Finally, she crashed into a large boulder, cracking it, and came to a stop.

<b>

"Guhh!"

<b>

She lay face down, her butt sticking up in the air, with her head turned towards the summit.

The roaring winds continued to blow from the epicenter of the explosion.

<b>

(What... what just happened?!)

<b>

Eventually, the winds heading downwards calmed, and then, in reverse, winds began to blow back towards the epicenter.

Suzy's cape, which had covered her body, was blown up, revealing her exposed backside.

<b>

A comical image of hiding her head while exposing her rear.

<b>

For a moment, this state continued...

<b>

"Ahhh! What the hell! Damn it!!"

<b>

She brushed off her cape and stood up vigorously.

<b>

<b>

"What the hell happened!? What the hell is going on!!!"

<b>

She looked around, her face slightly contorted.

<b>

"Whoa, what... what is this?"

<b>

Most of the snow had been blown away, revealing the rocky surface of the mountain, with scar-like marks extending from the summit downwards.

<b>

"What happened to the inside... what is going on?"

<b>

Feeling a cold sweat trickling down her back, she leaped towards the summit.

Soon, she reached the peak, but...

<b>

"Wh-what... the shape of the mountain range has changed?"

<b>

Sweat poured down her entire body.

<b>

<b>

"It looks completely different from when I first saw it. The peaks and valleys seem to have significantly lessened... right? Which was the highest peak? Is it... gone?"

<b>

The outer rim that should have been inside the mountain range had mostly left only traces behind.

The snow had completely disappeared.

Moreover, the caldera had been deeply gouged, blackened, and in some places, still smoldering red like magma.

<b>

It was a devastating act of environmental destruction.

It seemed like she might earn the title of 'Destroyer of World Heritage.'

With her face drained of color, she slowly turned around to check the state of the foot of the mountain.

<b>

From here, the sea of clouds had disappeared for quite a distance.

The impurities in the atmosphere seemed to have vanished; the view of the world below was unusually clear.

Was it just her imagination, or did the edge of the sea of clouds form a perfect circle around this point?

<b>

The whiteness of the snow had vanished for several kilometers from the summit.

Trees had been felled in a radiating pattern for 20 to 30 kilometers from the peak.

<b>

"Is this the Tunguska event?! No, that one reportedly caused damage over an area the size of Tokyo... so this is safe. Yes! Safe!!"

<b>

It's out, it's out!
