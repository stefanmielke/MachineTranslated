# 07 Susie and the White Mountains

The elevation was already over 8,000 meters.

However, the equipment is still just a fur coat.

<blank>

(Everest has a temperature of -30 or something, right?　I know you need an oxygen mask or something like that, but really, you can go to ....... This light equipment at an altitude as high as Mount Everest!　If a mountaineer heard this, he or she would say, "You've got to be kidding! but it's just a dream!　(And it's a stable dream, too!)

<blank>

It's easy, isn't it? I was thinking of .......

<blank>

<blank>

But ......, the closer we get to the summit, the bigger the mobs seem to get."

<blank>

We have slaughtered quite a few mobs from where the gatekeeper was to here.

The current equipment is further down a level from A to D equipment.

<blank>

<blank>

D equipment is white half-plate armor.

<blank>

The throat pads, shoulder pads, torso pads, shin pads and gauntlets are decorated with white plates, and under the grass skirt at the waist is an over-the-knee skirt made of thick leather, dazzling white thighs that peek out when the wearer moves.

<blank>

The bosom is also open, giving a remarkable peek at the twin dunes inside.

<blank>

The weapon is a one-handed sword called the Generation Sword.

As usual, he had two bottles in each hand.

<blank>

The thick blade has a thick grip, and the large cross-shaped brim protrudes forward at both ends like spines, with finely carved relief.

<blank>

<blank>

"When I dropped the rank of the weapon to D, it stopped blowing up,......, but I knew it would only take one hit!　The 'Frost Dragon' that was there earlier was also easily decapitated, even though it was big. ...... The "Frost Giant" that was there before that?　It was about the same size as the one we saw in Odaiba, so it must have been about 18 meters long.　But this one was also easily cut in half with a piece of bamboo. ......

<blank>

He mutters to no one in particular as he taps his right shoulder with the belly of the sword in his right hand, using it like a shoulder tap.

<blank>

"After all, Coco is also very blue. I guess it's stronger than the one below, but it's ....... I can't tell the difference anymore!"

<blank>

As he continued along the mountainside, he talked to himself as if he had given up.

<blank>

The summit is already in sight.

Suzy's physical ability would allow her to reach it in one leap.

Before reaching the summit, I stopped to turn around and look down from an altitude of over 9,000 meters.

<blank>

I knew it was this high up, the horizon is round. ...... It's amazing, it's not just a spectacular view, it's a view you can only dream of!　It's a view you can only reach ...... in your dreams."

<blank>

Beyond the mountain range spread out below us was the forest where we had been until the day before yesterday.

It is still quite vast.

It can be seen extending far to the south.

The horizon was so hazy with a sea of clouds that the end of the forest was only vaguely visible.

However, far beyond the forest, I could barely make out a flat area that might be inhabitable.

<blank>

This vast forest is also visible in some places, where the trees seem to be hollowed out and open, as if by insect bites.

Perhaps a lake or wetland.

I thought as I looked at ...... that the lake must be quite large since I could recognize it from this distance.

<blank>

Further to the west, on the right, this mountain range and forest continued unbroken far into the distance.

However, we could also see that a river continued to the south, cutting through the forest.

This must be a very large river, since it is clearly recognizable as a river from this distance.

<blank>

In the eastern direction, we could also see the end of the forest.

The sea is probably 100 kilometers ahead of us.

There must be cumulonimbus clouds above it. The clouds looked like they were rising from the sea.

<blank>

With a deep sigh, I placed myself in the midst of this hazy and brilliant landscape and admired the world for a while.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Well."

<blank>

How long had I been standing there?

He took his eyes off the world below and squinted as he turned himself toward the mountain side.

<blank>

I know you're out there, ......, on the other side.

<blank>

With a thud, it gouged the mountainside and leaped all the way to the top of the mountain.

As soon as he reaches the top, he turns his gaze immediately below.

What unfolds there is a white world behind the mountain range.

The world behind the vastness of life is the exact opposite of the world behind the vastness of life, a world so clear and closed off and purely white that not even a trace of life can be felt.

<blank>

...... great, it's like they're using this mountain range as an impulse to hide something."

<blank>

<blank>

The backside of a distant mountain range that rises over 9,000 meters above sea level and stretches far east and west.

At the far end was the outer rim of a huge, mortared, caldera.

<blank>

From here to the ridge at the edge of the caldera, the distance is about 10 km.

The diameter of the caldera's perimeter is twice that, probably well over 20 kilometers.

<blank>

On the other side of the outer rim of the mountain rose mountains at the same altitude as this one.

East and west.

It is as if this caldera is covered.

<blank>

And in its caldera, in the center of its mortar-shaped depression. ......

<blank>

<blank>

"...... there he is."

<blank>

Susie folded her arms and muttered as she looked down the center of it.

<blank>

'I've come this far, I don't have a choice but to not go see ....... There's a good chance it's a raid, but if you don't touch it, you'll be fine ...... because it was a game?　Either way, we need to get to where we can see it!　We've come this far ......, and if it's bad, we'll run immediately!

<blank>

He whispers to himself, as if making a final check.

<blank>

<blank>

There's a fair amount of mobs along the way, so let's just go for it!"

<blank>

With a thump, he kicked the mountaintop and leaped into the air.

He slides down the steep snow slope as dexterously as a ski with only his soles.

<blank>

On this side of the mountain, now spread out before us, is a monochromatic white world of nothing but snow and rock surfaces.

He slid there and jumped ahead.

<blank>

And then, the snow ahead of us started to rise up like a mole's path, and something was coming toward us.

Immediately after, a long, white, gigantic creature broke through the snow and leapt out with great force.

<blank>

<blank>

The Polar Worm is a giant worm-like creature, one meter thick and over 30 meters long.

At its tip is a huge, sharp, stag-like mandible.

<blank>

The Polar Worm opened its large jaws wide and came barreling straight at Suzie, trying to devour her.

<blank>

Just before contact, Susie jumped forward and then turned her body sideways, twisting and turning like a top.

The blade in his hand rips vertically through the body of the Polar Worm.

<blank>

The huge white body splits to the left and right with its momentum intact, splashing blue bodily fluids, and sinks into the white earth.

<blank>

Suzy landed on her feet and continued running as if nothing had happened.

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmm, now a pack?　The Great White Hound and White Fenrir are the bosses.

<blank>

One of them is 7 to 8 meters long, and the boss is almost twice as long.

A herd of about eight of them came around Suzy, with the boss in the center.

<blank>

(It looks like Princess Nantouka is riding on it. The power that comes rushing in is like a rhino or a hippopotamus)

<blank>

He huffed and puffed and leapt.

With his outstretched arms on their axis, he rotates his outstretched body forward and flies in a beautiful arc toward Fenrir, who is positioned behind him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Fenrir's eyes widened as he momentarily lost sight of his prey, but he soon realized that it was coming at him from above.

<blank>

If it comes from the other side, it's just right, so we'll make time, jump up and catch it directly with our fangs.

Fenrir thought so and timed his kick to the ground and bared his fangs.

<blank>

Suzy effortlessly dodged its fangs, stomped on the bridge of its nose, and landed backward.

Fenrir was stomped on the nose and knocked straight down to the ground from the chin.

<blank>

Meanwhile, the herd, having missed its prey, panics and turns on its heel toward Fenrir in the rear.

<blank>

Suzy takes up an exquisite position behind Fenrir and prepares to fire her skills forward.

He lightly opened his legs back and forth, sat back, and thrust out his hands, pointing the tip of the cut at the target.

<blank>

I'm chopping it up!　BEEEEETT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

≪Impulse Burst.

Skills for "Dueling Barbarians."

It is a melee ranged attack skill that shoots sword chi forward to attack a wide range of enemies.

<blank>

The swords in both hands were opened horizontally to the rear at once, as if to cut through the space in front of them with a gust of wind.

The shockwave that spread from the open tip of the sword sliced through Fenrir and the pack of whitehounds in an instant.

<blank>

Suzy took one look at the white snowfield with blood and flesh splattered all over it and immediately started running.

<blank>

After that, we came in contact with several more lizards and insect-like mobs, but we mostly just passed each other as if we were passing each other.

Eventually, after five minutes of running, we reached the foot of the outer rim of the mountain and ran all the way up to the ridge.

<blank>

"There's no Mob inside here except for that thing. ...... I'll have to be better prepared this time."

<blank>

When he said this, he switched his equipment from D to G Zero.

<blank>

Dark green heavy armor and light red cape.

He holds an armed sword that discharges in both hands.

<blank>

He began to enchant himself and raise the level of his abilities.

<blank>

I've got enough top quality recovery drugs, over 100 drops of Phoenix, and an emergency breakaway scroll for when the need arises!　Mm!　Snacks are limited to 500 yen!　Bananas do not count as snacks!　It's an expedition until you get back!　Let's go!

<blank>

At once, we jumped off the ridge and ran toward the center of the white caldera.

<blank>

We jumped, ran, and descended inside the almost cliff-like caldera.

As I ran down the road with a cloud of snow, I was able to see it.

<blank>

(...... looking at you, right? I knew it wasn't an object. I'm sure he noticed me from the other side of the mountain.)

<blank>

<blank>

It was only when it became possible to tag it that the name was confirmed.

<blank>

("Cocytus Dragon Kaina"?　Wow, there are a few more of them already!　I'm sure there are some more!　The color is ...... yellow, or is it around 100 levels?　That's subtle! I wonder if normal mobs can go there?　...... No!　No!　This guy is just like a boss or a raid.... If it's a raid, even a pale blue can beat it, right?　I'll just have to take a hit in commemoration and run away!　I guess I'll just have to take a hit as a souvenir and run back home.　(Even if it's ......, it's still huge!)

<blank>

The distance has already been reduced to about 100 meters, but the size of the area can be clearly seen.

<blank>

(I wonder if it was something like this, like a supersaurus?)

<blank>

The total length is approximately 40 meters.

Its neck is long like that of a long-necked dragon, and its limbs are thick and strong like those of an elephant or rhinoceros.

<blank>

Its entire body is white as snow, covered with scales like ice or crystal, and casts a dark blue lapis lazuli shadow in the light.

Two pairs of wings grow on its back. The four bat-like wings have a light bluish tinge.

White, goat-thick horns twisted from the head, extending backward for a long time.

His face was forested with countless thorns like a beard, shining like icicles.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When we got as close as about 50 meters, we yukked it up and proceeded to explore the warning points.

He is lying on the ground as if asleep, but I can see that he has opened his eyes and is looking at Suzy.

<blank>

At 40 meters, blow out your breath through your nose.

<blank>

At 30 meters, it turns its chin toward us.

<blank>

At a distance of 20 meters, he lifted his chin from the ground, turned his head toward us, opened his golden eyes, and stared at us.

<blank>

(This... this line is the battle point.)

<blank>

There is an earth-shaking echo, probably coming from this dragon.

<blank>

'Son of man in power, mighty man worthy to stand before my face.

<blank>

(Oh, he's talking!　Can you talk to him?)

<blank>

'Endure my trials and show me your strength.

<blank>

He stood up and turned his face upward as if to avert his eyes, and I could feel his throat swelling.

<blank>

What?　Yuck!!!!"

<blank>

Quickly re-equip from two swords to a shield.

A large shaped shield appeared on his left arm.

<blank>

Oh my God!"

<blank>

≪'fredge of the guardians'.

Skills for the shield position "Sentinel Knight".

It is a shield defense-specific skill that increases shield defense by 2,000, magical and physical defense by 250%, and evasion rate and speed by 80%.

<blank>

Holding a huge shield in his left hand that resembled a long, vertical kite shield, he raised it and thrust its sharply angled lower part into the ground with a mighty thud.

<blank>

Immediately afterwards, a torrent of intense white light runs and closes in.

The dragon's powerful breath chipped away at the snowfield around it.

However, Suzy is blocked by the shield and cannot reach it.

<blank>

Again, no questions asked?　I was hoping we could have a conversation this time!

(!!!?　No damage?　Checking?　(Wait and see?)

<blank>

The white light was interrupted.

Suzy doesn't miss that pause.

He thrust his right fist, still holding his sword, toward the dragon and shouted.

<blank>

YEAH, I'M GOT IT!!!!"

<blank>

≪'Magic Breaks'.

The skills of the magic attack job "Arc Wizard".

Destroys the target's magic defenses and also deals magic damage.

It is the first ironclad skill in the magic profession.

<blank>

The sound of destruction, like shattering glass, echoed across the snowfield.

A magic circle like a shredded spider web appears around the dragon, then melts and disappears.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to say.

<blank>

The dragon flipped over and I saw the white scales on its back shimmering and splattering like shards of ice.

As it is, the dragon echoes the earth with yukkuri and falls to the snowfield in a cloud of snow.

<blank>

Huh?"　Oh, that?　Hey, why?　Why?　Huh?　Did you fall down?

<blank>

They are upset that the dragon fell so easily.

<blank>

And then, zzz, zzz, the dragon lifted its neck and jaw, and then lifted its body by standing up on all four limbs.

<blank>

'......nu, muh ......n.'

<blank>

"Feint?　I know, I know, it can't be that easy.

<blank>

The strength that had been slipping from his body was reinserted.

<blank>

Well, how about this guy next?

(I haven't switched to a cane, but we'll see how it goes!　...... once I shoot this one, I'll run for it!)

<blank>

He shouted as he raised his right hand high and then swung it down vigorously.

<blank>

Eat me!　Eat me!!! ！！！！"

<blank>

≪'Mars Inferno'.

High-level flame-hitting skills in "Arc Wizard."

High-heat flames reaching tens of thousands of degrees compressed at ultra-high density are released all at once.

It is a magic skill with the highest attack power of the flame attribute.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was a moment.

<blank>

<blank>

A moment later a small sun-like glow appeared in the space a few meters above the dragon's head.

<blank>

The earth dissolved along with the dragons.

The super high-pressure detonation that occurred at high altitudes with low atmospheric pressure produced unusual destructive power.

<blank>

The plasma generated from the high-density flames that were released became even more massive due to the low atmospheric pressure and scraped the earth.

The destructive blast blew snow and earth like dust.

Most of the outer ridge of the mountain has been scraped away, and the mountain range on the outer rim is crumbling and flying away.

Clouds were blown away from the atmosphere, storms crawled over the ground, and trees were reaped over a wide area.

<blank>

Suzy, who had instantly lost the earth she was supposed to step on, was swallowed up and blown away, helplessly by the blast.

<blank>

Dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　Bek!　Bwah!　Guhaah?　Ideeaaa!　Bubbeh!

<blank>

It strikes the earth, is sent flying, and blows away, gouging the earth further.

<blank>

It blew up to the outer rim of the mountain range, gouging the earth with its body.

It was unable to kill the momentum as it fell into the mountainside, and it was scraped up to the top of the mountain and thrown out of the mountain range.

<blank>

Zumbelabo!　Ah-da!　Gahahah?　Ada-da-da!

<blank>

They hit rocks or other objects that jut out of the mountain face and roll down 4 to 500 meters, jumping and bouncing.

<blank>

Oh-oh-go!　Oh-oh!　Ooooh!　Ooidee-dee-dee!　Bo-hee!　Oh-oh-oh!"

<blank>

Finally, we hit a large boulder and finally came to a stop, cracking the rock.

<blank>

Gubbaaahhhh!"

<blank>

Patari ...... and fell down on the spot with his buttocks sticking up, with his head in the direction of the summit.

Roaring, strong winds that still diffuse from the hypocenter continue to blow.

<blank>

(What the ......, what the ......, what the hell happened?)

<blank>

Eventually, the wind toward the foot of the mountain subsided, and the wind began to blow back toward the hypocenter, this time swinging back the other way.

The cloak covering Suzy's body was agitated and rolled up, covering her head and exposing her buttocks.

<blank>

The figure of the head and not the buttocks.

<blank>

It remained in place for a while, but .......

<blank>

It's "Dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　Get out of the way!　contchooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

He brushed off his cloak and stood up vigorously.

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell is going on?　I said, "What the hell is going on!

<blank>

He looks around on the spot and pulls a light face.

<blank>

"Oh, ko ......, koriwa ......?"

<blank>

Most of the snow had been blown away, leaving the white surface of the mountain bare and rocky, with scar-like marks extending from the summit down to the bottom.

<blank>

"Inside is ......, what the hell happened to ......?"

<blank>

I leaped toward the summit, feeling an unpleasant sweat trickling down my back.

Eventually, you will soon reach the summit peak, .......

<blank>

"Is this ......, or is it ...... with a different shape for the mountain range?"

<blank>

Sweat is pouring down his entire body.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm not sure if the dive is different from when I first saw Coco. I feel like the peaks are a lot less uneven. ......? Which was the highest peak? I mean, is it the one that's gone ......?"

<blank>

The outer rim of the mountain, which should have been inside the mountain range, is almost all that remains.

The snow had disappeared nicely.

On the contrary, the caldera was gouged out and melted black, and in some places it was still smoldering like red magma.

<blank>

It is a spectacular destruction of nature.

It's going to get the title of World Heritage Destroyer.

With a great deal of blood on my face, I turned around and checked the foothills.

<blank>

The sea of clouds is gone for a long way from here.

The view of the lower land is unusually good, probably due to the absence of atmospheric impurities.

Is it my imagination that the edge of the sea of clouds seems to be nicely circular around here?

<blank>

The whiteness of the snow is gone for miles from the summit.

Trees had been reaped for 2 to 30 kilometers, radiating out from the top of the mountain.

<blank>

Is this the Tungusic explosion?　No, no, we're talking about an area the size of Tokyo that was damaged, so ...... this is safe. Unh!　Safe!

<blank>

Out, out, out!
