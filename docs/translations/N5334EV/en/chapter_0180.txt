# 168 The Guards of the Backstreets

I'm not impressed that you'd go into a place like this with just the girls."

<blank>

The red one I had marked is farther back. It's still way over on that corner.

At least the person who just approached me is not red.

And his tone is a bit stern and scolding, but with a hint of gentleness.

<blank>

'You're a traveler? Didn't they teach you that when you entered the city? It is very dangerous for a small group of people to enter a place like this.

<blank>

Two men dressed as guards approached us.

The two were breathing slightly hard, as if they had come running in a great hurry.

<blank>

Even at ......, these two are pretty decent guards, aren't they?

The guard at the entrance to the city looked like a real thug, badly outfitted. ......

These two are well dressed and are comparable to the guards in other cities such as Amkam and Dekembel.

His expression is tight and he appears to be an honest person.

One person's shoulder patch has one more line, so it looks like a boss and a subordinate?

Is he really of the same species as the entrance guard who had a loose face?

<blank>

No, nothing in particular was said ......"

'No explanation given? At all! What is the person in charge doing!"

Guard Chief ...... is in charge of the guys in squad 5 today."

Shit! Ladies, let's hurry back to the main road! You got a place to stay? If I know the name, I'll send you there!"

<blank>

The two turned their backs to us as if to protect us, as if to warn us of the area, and said they would take us back to the inn.

Hmm? This is not what I expected. What's going on here? As I was making eye contact with Bibi, they appeared from the corner where we had turned.

<blank>

What's that? Aren't these the guards at the entrance of the city?

He finds Mia and smiles a nifty smile.

Wow! This guy is creepy! Seriously, he's just a thug, isn't he?

<blank>

As you can see from my first impression, these guys were wearing their uniforms in a messy and, to put it bluntly, disheveled manner.

Moreover, if you look closely, the stains on the clothes are quite noticeable!

<blank>

In comparison, the people in front of me now are neatly dressed in their guards' uniforms, and their appearance and movements seem disciplined.

<blank>

"...... Shit!"

'Ladies, I'll protect you no matter what. See an opening and run to the main street."

<blank>

Seeing the thug, the two guards who were standing by us gave a small snide remark.

<blank>

"Well, look who it is, the head of guard Crunch of Team 2, isn't it? Selling oil in a place like this?"

We're on patrol. What are you doing here? This is not the jurisdiction of Team 5.

We got a call. I'm on duty right now."

<blank>

They look at us with an unpleasant smile on their faces.

<blank>

Oi! You girls there! Why don't you behave yourselves? I'm going to have to ask you to come to the guardroom."

"At the Tsumesho? Can you tell us why?

He said, "I'm suspicious when you're hanging around these back streets! I'll take him in anyway."

We were just looking for a shortcut to the hotel!

I'll listen to what you have to say. Come on!"

<blank>

The thuggish guard modo comes to me, grinning and answering to Bibi, and reaches out his hand.

No questions asked?

That's a very arrogant thing to say. Is it natural because he's a thug?

I would like to say a few words here.

<blank>

My father told me not to follow strangers in a new city.

"Yeah? We are guards! Can't you see that?

"EMT, is this ......? I'm sorry, I don't understand.

You're naive! Look at me! You're just like them, aren't you?

You say, "...... What? Isn't it? Compared to the people here, you look much poorer, don't you?"

What the hell?

I wonder if they are the ones who imitated the outfits? And. And ......"

<blank>

He took out a handkerchief, held it to his mouth and showed it with a raised eyebrow.

Then, furthermore, he dropped one incendiary word, miryu!

<blank>

It's a little too smelly for me to want you to go near.

"......!!!!"

<blank>

When I said, "It stinks," one of the guards on this side of the room blew up. I said, "It stinks," and one of the guards on this side of the room blew up. The one who was called "Chief Crunch Guard" slightly twitched his cheek, "...... oui oui oui," and stepped forward as if to protect me.

<blank>

No, no, no, no, no, no!

I guess I'm going to have to teach you a lesson!

<blank>

Two of the goons are red in the face and look like they are about to let the steam out of their heads.

<blank>

Wait a minute! They are not criminals! They're civilians!

Move! Crunch!

We'll decide that!"

<blank>

Do you think I would let such lawlessness pass me by?

<blank>

The one called "Mr. Crunch" got between us and the thug guards and tried to control their movements with his body.

However, as if they were annoyed that Mr. Crunch had stopped them, the two hoodlums' faces changed.

<blank>

You don't get it, do you? Oi! Crunch!

We have the right to make decisions! Have you forgotten that?

<blank>

That's not true!

Don't get carried away, Crunch! You got a little crush on my daughter? Yeah?

"...... you!"

<blank>

One of the goons held Mr. Crunch by the throat with his arm and pushed him forcefully against the alley wall.

<blank>

How are your wife and daughter? Have you seen their faces lately? Baboon!

OH, ......!"

Hey! You guys, come on. ......"

You too, Martell! You too, Martell!

<blank>

The second thug pushes the other guard, whose body is still pushed against the wall.

This guard is said to be Mr. Martel.

<blank>

With the impact of the large man's body slamming into the wall, pieces of the wall, like clods of dirt, fall from above.

<blank>

Whether people live here or not, the area is almost a slum, and the condition of the buildings is quite bad because they are not cared for.

<blank>

Looking toward the top of the wall where the clods had fallen, I saw several flowerpots placed in the overhanging window.

It must not have been cared for for a long time. The wooden planks that extend over the edge of the window to hold the pots are so tattered that they look as if they are about to fall down.

<blank>

<blank>

But what is this?

The scene of a legitimate guard being held down by a thug is an unbelievable scene unfolding in front of our eyes.

Who's the picture of a dirty little thug wall-donning a dignified guard-sama?

<blank>

I gave a small sigh and quickly picked up a coin ......1c copper coin in my skirt pocket.

He plays it with his thumb and shoots it diagonally upward.

For a moment, there was a small, high-pitched metallic "kin! The two hoodlums did not seem to pay any attention to the high-pitched metallic sound.

<blank>

The coin instantly shattered the tattered boards on the window.

The multiple flowerpots on it descend straight down without defying gravity.

Then, as if sucked in, it hit the two hoodlums directly on the head.

<blank>

Gabapetto! Ngobap!

<blank>

The two who received direct hits made funny noises and fell into a coma on the spot.

I knew a helmet was important!

Two of the guards were wearing proper helmets, but the two goons took a direct hit to their bare heads and this is what happened. ......

<blank>

It's bad enough that you're right under a collapsing building, rampaging around without a care in the world about the area.

If they had been wearing helmets, this tragedy would not have happened.

<blank>

What an unfortunate lot, you know."

<blank>

Bibi and Mia look at me with a jealous look in their eyes at my silliness.

<blank>

Yes, I know what you're looking at me like that, okay?

Mia would put weights on the falling pots, doubling their weight, right?

Bibi was using an air curtain to set the trajectory of the fall, wasn't he?

<blank>

When I complained about it with my eyes, they both swept their gazes in the wrong direction. Noooo .......

<blank>

What the hell? What the hell is ......?"

Something fell from above. It's not safe to be near the wall, okay?"

<blank>

The two guards were unable to swallow the situation when the two hoodlums suddenly collapsed.

When I explained the situation to him, his eyes widened again and he said that it was dangerous here and carried the two fallen hoodlums to a safe place.

<blank>

I can't leave it like this. Martell! You watch the two of them! I'll go to the guardroom and get someone."

<blank>

I told him not to move me because I had hit my head, and the head guard said, "Sorry to bother you, but ......" and said he would take us to the main street.

<blank>

As we walked away, I thanked him for his help and said, "No, on the contrary, I am sorry for being so ungrateful," the chief guard said, as if embarrassed.

<blank>

Even so, I was impressed by the fact that the chief of guards was so considerate of such a thug, and I was impressed by the fact that there are good people everywhere. I was moved by this.
