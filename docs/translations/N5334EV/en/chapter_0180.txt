# Chapter 168: The Guards of the Back Streets

"To think you girls would wander into a place like this, I'm not impressed."

<b>

The red mark I was watching is further back. It's still way beyond that corner.

At least the person who just spoke isn't wearing red.

Moreover, their tone is a bit stern, almost scolding, but it carries a hint of kindness.

<b>

"Are you travelers? Didn't anyone tell you when you entered the city? It's extremely dangerous to wander into places like this with such a small group."

<b>

The ones who spoke are a pair dressed as guards.

They seem to have rushed over in a panic, slightly out of breath.

<b>

...But these two are quite decent guards, aren't they?

The guards at the entrance of the city looked so poorly equipped that they resembled real thugs... 

These two are well-dressed, and compared to guards from other cities like Amukam or Dekkenbel, they are not lacking at all.

Their expressions are tight, and they seem like honest people.

One of them has an extra stripe on his shoulder, so it feels like a superior and subordinate relationship, right?

Are they really of the same kind as the slacker guard at the entrance?

<b>

"No, I wasn't told anything in particular..."

"Not a single explanation? Honestly! What is the person in charge doing?!"

"Captain of the guards... today's duty is with the fifth squad."

"Damn! Ladies, we need to hurry back to the main street! Do you have a place to stay? If you tell me the name, I'll escort you there!"

<b>

The two of them turned their backs to us, as if to protect us, and said they would escort us to the inn.

Hmm? This isn't the situation I anticipated. What should we do here? As I exchanged glances with Bibi, those thugs popped their heads out from the corner we had just turned.

<b>

Huh? Aren't they the guards from the entrance of the city?

They spotted Mia and broke into a creepy grin.

Eww! This guy is gross!! Seriously, just a thug, right?

<b>

As expected from my first impression, these guys are wearing their uniforms in a slovenly manner, to put it bluntly, they look disheveled.

Moreover, upon closer inspection, the dirt on their clothes is quite noticeable, making them look really filthy!

<b>

In contrast, the people right in front of me are wearing their guard uniforms properly, and there's a sense of discipline in their demeanor and movements.

<b>

"...Damn!"

"Ladies, I will protect you no matter what happens. Look for an opportunity to run to the main street."

<b>

The two guards near us muttered under their breath as they looked at the thugs.

<b>

"Oh, if it isn't the second squad's Crunch, what are you doing slacking off here?"

"We're on patrol. What are you doing here? This is not under the jurisdiction of the fifth squad."

"We received a report. We're currently on duty."

<b>

With an unpleasant grin, those thugs shot us a glance.

<b>

"Hey! You girls over there! Stay quiet, okay? You're coming with us to the station."

"To the station?! Could you please tell us the reason?!"

"Just wandering around in a back alley makes you suspicious! For now, we're taking you in."

"We were just looking for a shortcut to our hotel!"

"I'll listen to your story at the station. Just come with us!"

<b>

The thug guard reached out towards Bibi with a smirk.

No questions asked, huh?

That's quite a brazen way to speak. I guess it's to be expected from a thug?

Well then, let me say a word too.

<b>

"My father told me not to follow strangers in a new city, and I'm following his advice."

"Oh? We're guards! Can't you tell?!"

"Guards... you say? I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand."

"Are you ignorant of the world? Look closely! You're the same as those guys, right?!"

"...Eh? Is that so? Compared to these people, you look quite shabby, don't you?"

"What did you say?!"

"Are you perhaps imitating those people? And also..."

<b>

I took out a handkerchief, covered my mouth, and furrowed my brow.

Then, I decided to throw in a provoking remark!

<b>

"You smell too bad for me to want to get close."

"...!!"

<b>

When I said "smell," the guard on our side burst out laughing. The one called Crunch slightly twitched his cheeks and stepped forward as if to protect me.

<b>

"Y-You little brat!"

"It seems you don't understand your place!"

<b>

The two thugs turned red in the face, looking like steam was about to come out of their heads.

<b>

"Hey, wait! They're not criminals! They're ordinary citizens!"

"Get out of the way, Crunch!!"

"That's for us to decide!"

<b>

"Do you think I would overlook such lawlessness?!"

<b>

The one called Crunch stepped between us and the thugs, trying to restrain their movements with his body.

However, it seemed that being stopped by Crunch irritated the thugs, and their expressions changed.

<b>

"You really don't get it, do you?! Hey! Crunch!!"

"The decision-making power lies with us! Have you forgotten that?!"

<b>

"That doesn't matter!!"

"Don't get cocky, Crunch! Are you reminded of your daughter? Huh?!"

"â€¦You bastard!"

<b>

One of the thugs grabbed Crunch by the throat and forcefully pressed him against the wall of the alley.

<b>

"How's your wife and daughter? Have you been able to see their faces lately? Hehe!"

"You...!"

"Hey! You guys better stop..."

"You too, Martel! Don't get cocky either!"

<b>

The second thug shoved the other guard, who is apparently named Martel, against the wall as well.

<b>

The impact of slamming the large man's body against the wall caused bits of dirt to fall from above, like small clumps of soil.

<b>

Whether people live here or not, this area seems to be mostly a slum, and the state of the buildings is quite poor due to lack of maintenance.

<b>

Looking up at the wall from which the dirt was falling, I noticed several flowerpots placed on a protruding window.

They probably haven't been taken care of for a long time. The board laid out to hold the pots is already falling apart and looks like it could collapse at any moment.

<b>

<b>

But what is this?

An unbelievable scene is unfolding before my eyes, where thugs are pinning down decent guards.

What kind of ridiculous image is it to see filthy thugs walling in dignified guards?!

<b>

I let out a small sigh and quietly took a coin... a 1 copper coin from my skirt pocket.

I flicked it with my thumb, sending it flying diagonally upwards.

For a moment, a high-pitched metallic sound of "kin!" echoed softly around, but the two thugs showed no sign of noticing.

<b>

The coin instantly shattered the rotting board that was laid over the window.

The multiple flowerpots resting on it fell straight down without defying gravity.

And they struck the two thugs' heads directly as if they were being sucked in.

<b>

"Ga-pe?!?!" "N-go-ba!!"

<b>

The two thugs, hit directly, made strange noises and collapsed on the spot.

Helmets really are important, aren't they?

The decent guards were wearing helmets properly, while the thugs took a direct hit on their bare heads and ended up like this...

<b>

It's their fault for causing a ruckus right under a crumbling building.

If they had been wearing helmets, such a tragedy wouldn't have occurred.

<b>

"What an unfortunate bunch, indeed."

<b>

At my nonchalant remark, Bibi and Mia shot me a glare.

<b>

No, even if you give me that look, I know, okay?

Mia doubled the weight of the falling pots, didn't you?

Bibi used an air curtain to adjust the trajectory of the falling pots, right?

<b>

When I conveyed that with my eyes, both of them looked away in a different direction. Hmph...

<b>

"What? What on earth..."

"It seems something fell from above. The wall side is dangerous, you know?"

<b>

The two guards were unable to comprehend the situation regarding the suddenly collapsed thugs.

When I explained the situation, they opened their eyes wide again and decided to move the collapsed thugs to a safe place, saying this area was dangerous.

<b>

"We can't just leave them like this. Martel! Keep an eye on those two! I'll go to the station and call for help."

<b>

After instructing them not to move due to the head injury, the captain of the guards said, "Sorry for the inconvenience, but..." and offered to guide us to the main street.

<b>

As we walked, I thanked him, saying, "Thank you for your help," to which he replied, "No, I'm sorry for being so incompetent," with a humbled expression.

<b>

Even so, I was slightly moved by the captain of the guards, who didn't forget to show concern even for those thugs. It seems that capable people can be found anywhere.
