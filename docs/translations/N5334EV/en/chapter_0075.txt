Lisa was pulled up by a chain wrapped around her right ankle, her left leg was open without effort, her robe was rolled up and hanging down, and her thigh was exposed in all its glory.

The woman wearing chains lifts the base of Lisa's legs up to the level of her face, puts her nose close to the base of Lisa's legs, sniffs them, and says happily, "It's my first time to smell something!

<blank>

Look, look, a maiden who has not yet known a man. And she is a priestess! A saint, a holy woman! Oh, Halbert, you'll be so pleased."

<blank>

Marina. The maiden is fine, but isn't that saint going to die soon if she stays like that? She has such a big hole in her belly, and she spilled a lot of blood, didn't she? What a waste. We must keep her alive until we deliver her to Mr. Halbert. Well, you can enjoy it even if it's dead, but it's a maiden, isn't it? I would like you to enjoy it while it's still alive.

<blank>

A woman in black stood beside Lisa, crawling her fingers with glazed movements on Lisa's right leg, which was suspended, and spoke to the woman she herself called Marina.

<blank>

Marina muttered to the woman in black, "That's true," and then she grabbed the chain that came out of Lisa's back and pulled it out with great force.

<blank>

'Geeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ！！！！！'

<blank>

Lisa's shrieks echoed around the area.

<blank>

"Ummm, good voice...did it hurt? Hmmm... ......"

<blank>

Marina squinted happily and looked down at Lisa's suspended face.

As it is, he puts out his right hand and roughly pulls off the front drape of the robe that is hanging down.

<blank>

Aggghhhh!"

<blank>

Lisa screams.

Her exposed lower abdomen was overflowing with blood, her shorts, which would have been white, were stained bright red with the overflowing blood, and the wound below the navel was about to overflow with an unstoppable flow of blood.

<blank>

Marina puts her right hand on it and strokes the wound with a glazed movement.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm not sure! Iya ...... yiyaaaa! Aaah!

<blank>

Lisa sulked and screamed some more.

<blank>

Look, I've plugged the hole, so we'll wait a while, okay?"

<blank>

When Marina removed her hand from Lisa's lower belly, the wound was already gone there.

As it is, Marina happily licks off Lisa's blood on her hands with her long, outstretched tongue.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A vampire used healing?

Damn." Lisa! Wait for me! I'm coming for you!

Don't get distracted, Kyle! Cornell! Deploy the stiffs! Get the non-combatants back!

<blank>

Tony shouted in surprise, while Cedric held back Kyle, who was about to jump out of the way, and without taking his eyes off the vampires, he flew instructions to the troops in the rear.

<blank>

Conrad!

Oh, yeah!"

<blank>

Howard and Conrad kick the ground again and run toward the enemy in front of them. Their goal is a woman in chains. She is a vampire called Marina.

Shoot and destroy them all at once, and rescue the captives.

<blank>

When Marina noticed them approaching and smiled suspiciously, the chains surrounding the woman surged and stretched up toward them.

Conrad held a huge battle-axe in front of him and spun it forward as if it were a baton made of twigs.

The double-bladed battle axe, roaring with power and cutting through the surrounding atmosphere, flicked, entangled, and broke the chains that were closing in on the two men.

<blank>

Howard slips through the gap where the chains have scattered and closes in on the marina in a single breath.

He swung his "Grand Divider", which was covered with a blue, nebulous light, to the upper left and shot down at the woman without any hesitation at all.

Marina's smile disappeared and her gaze turned stern for a moment. A moment later, just as it seemed that the black blade would reach her, a violent metallic sound echoed and sparks flew around the area.

<blank>

Nu?"

Kuh-ah?

<blank>

Howard's great black sword was piercing the earth.

In that instant, Marina leapt further backward, along with the victims she had entangled in chains.

<blank>

I'm outbid?

<blank>

The brown woman raised her own greatsword to catch Howard's shot-down sword rage, but was sent flying with the whole greatsword.

He spun his body on the spot to kill the momentum, then turned to face Howard again, his eyes wide and his voice incredulous.

<blank>

Joel! Back off!!!!"

<blank>

Reacting to the voice coming from behind her, the brown woman quickly backed up, and a pale green sword flash ran through the place where she had been a moment before.

With the shimmering green glow of his eyepatch shimmering, he ran his sword and dagger in two and three successive flashes, and Gilberto chased down the brown woman called Joel.

<blank>

The next moment, however, Gilberto was hit by several flaming bullets in rapid succession.

Gilberto ducks just in time, but the flaming bullet misses its target and explodes, piercing the ground.

Each of the flame bullets is powerful enough to blow off half of a person's body if it hits an ordinary person.

<blank>

'Tsk! That was an unnecessary move, Elektra!"

"Oh? Did I look like I was being pushed, Joel?"

Hmph! Marina! Did you pick any more?

"Hmmm, I lost a few, but I caught three already, didn't I?"

<blank>

Howard and the others were taken aback by that line.

While Howard and his men were slashing with the three vampires, the attack and defense between the demon chains and the knights was going on behind them.

<blank>

In the rear, several members of the Knights have fallen, and several non-combatant members of the logistics unit are lying on the ground and moaning in agony.

Around them, many cut-off chains wriggled like snakes, eventually dissolving into a mist of blood and disappearing into the atmosphere.

<blank>

Cedric had cut off several chains that were closing in on Joseline, who was riding on a stretcher with three doctors.

Tony and Kyle were also vigilant around the three doctors and the logistics unit, repeatedly attacking and defending themselves against the chains that repeatedly made anomalous movements beside Cedric.

Magritte and Raisa, with the help of Djimon and others, also fought off the chains that were closing in on them.

But still, there were casualties among them.

<blank>

You have blinded us?

"I'm sorry Master, my eyes failed to catch it."

Howard! These guys are tricky!

<blank>

The three men lined up in a row, their eyes sharp and ready.

<blank>

Jangling chains hung in the air, and the flickering flames of the still-burning trees illuminated the new victims floating from the dark depths of the forest.

One person in knight's equipment is unconscious. The other two were logistics personnel in work clothes like chaps.

One of them was still conscious and was letting out a small scream with a muffled moan.

All three girls are still young.

<blank>

C'mon!

<blank>

Howard grits his teeth.

<blank>

Now, I am very sorry to leave you, but I have kept the Lord waiting, so I must be off.

You think I'm going to let you get away with this?

<blank>

Conrad's voice rose to a howl and he kicked the ground at the words of the woman in black called Elektra.

Then a brown woman called Joel snaps her fingers.

The next moment, a black wall rose up between Howard and the women with a roar that tore the earth apart.

<blank>

It was not a wall, but a huge black skeleton reminiscent of a reptile.

Three of them, one after another. They rose up from the earth, pushing up the surface of the earth, and stood in front of the three like a wall.

<blank>

Howard and his team quickly leap back and distance themselves.

<blank>

"...... Nuh? Another 'Old Scale Dinosaur'?"

<blank>

Conrad looked up at it with steely eyes and muttered.

<blank>

Old Scale Dinosaur" is a giant theropod undead.

The skeleton, salvaged from its prehistoric age, is a murky yellowish-brown color, stained and spreading, and the bones are chipped here and there, showing signs of weathering.

The 14- to 5-meter-long body was supported by a thick, massive femur at about its center, and a long, human-height skull was lined with knife-like fangs, indicating that the skeleton's owner was clearly a carnivorous creature.

It is a huge undead creature reminiscent of a carnivorous dinosaur similar to a T. Rex. If several of them appeared, the Knights alone would not be able to hold them off.

The two soles that appeared in the evening reaped a number of knights and swallowed several non-combatants whole.

But it was Howard, Conrad, and Gilbert who took them down.

<blank>

However, the thing that now appears in front of me is clearly different from the previous one.

Its body was more than one size larger than the others, and its body had a black glow as if it were made of obsidian.

<blank>

Conrad! This is clearly different from the one we destroyed earlier in the evening! Stay with me!

<blank>

Howard voiced to Conrad to be on the lookout.

<blank>

"It was given to me by the Lord for my common use, you know?"

<blank>

Isn't it adorable?　And before long, a woman in black called Electra spoke to Howard and the others as she sat sideways on its skull and stroked its head.

<blank>

I'd like to go play around with this some more. ......

<blank>

A brown woman called Joel, astride a skull, said, ruefully brushing her bangs up.

<blank>

We'll deliver the food first. We'll take it easy afterwards. ......?"

<blank>

A woman, still straddling the skull and wearing a chain called Marina, looked down at Howard and the others with a quiet smile and said.

<blank>

I told you I won't let you get away with it!"

<blank>

As Conrad kicked the ground again, the three ancient dragon bones lowered themselves in unison, opened their massive jaws, and roared a dragon roar.

It was lower and heavier than any brass instrument with a heavy bass sound, vibrating both the earth and the atmosphere and creating a gust of wind around the area.

<blank>

Conrad was caught up in the air by the vibrations and was flung backward.

<blank>

Let's do ......!

<blank>

Stomping on the ground, Conrad was the first to take a bite out of one of his eighteen howl systems, and he gritted his teeth with a ferocious smile at his unawareness.

<blank>

I will visit you again after midnight. Until then, I bid you adieu for the time being.

<blank>

Elektra raised one hand above the black skull to converge the magic.

The magical power became a flame, and Electra's upward-pointing palm began to rotate as a saucer. The density of the magic increased even more, and it began to shine so brightly that one could not see it directly.

<blank>

No! Conrad, get down! Cedric, my Lord! Get me out of here!

<blank>

Light shot out with a series of explosions, and countless flaming bullets shot into the area.

<blank>

Flame bombs that hit the ground exploded and made large holes in the earth, and if they hit trees, they punched holes in them, knocked them down, and set them ablaze.

If it hit the wall the Knights had built, it gouged out the wall material as if it had been shot at, creating large and small craters in the wall.

Even heavily armed knights could not get away with a direct hit.

In an instant, the whole area was transformed into a devastation that looked like a bombed-out battlefield site.

<blank>

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Please have your party ready by the time I return. We look forward to it.

<blank>

After the fire bombardment subsided, the three vampires were gone, along with the three huge black dragon bones.

<blank>

<blank>

Cedric Meyer lowered his own kite shield, which cut and smoked against the flaming bullets, and looked up and around with his sword propped up and on one knee.

The surface where many craters had formed was still smoking, and the flames from the fallen trees illuminated the area.

About a third of the barricades and walls built by the logistics forces had fallen down and were still smoking.

Most of the knights were damaged and moaning. Some of them were seriously wounded, bleeding and unable to move.

<blank>

"............ half destroyed the Knights with a single blow?"

<blank>

With a look of disbelief on his face, Cedric Meyer looked deep into the forest where the vampires had disappeared.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A rough plain where the living and the unborn overflow the earth and stir. The black walls that surround it rise and fall.

And a cave in the black wall overlooking the dead.

<blank>

At the end of the entrance, there was a small space.

The space, which spread out like a small hall, was supported by pillars of rock piled up by time.

Around it, too, the walls are piled up like layers and layers of veils with waves of black rocks, the result of a long time passing.

It was a majestic space reminiscent of an otherworldly temple.

<blank>

As soon as one stepped into the hall, a huge tent made of thick red fabric occupied the space.

Hanging from the ceiling of the hall, the blood-red velvet fabric, with its loose drapes folded in layers, had an overwhelming presence in that black space.

<blank>

Black columns and walls and a red velvet tent. It was like a huge pool of blood invading the black temple.

That was the only space that was disconnected from reality.

<blank>

The tent, which looked like a pool of blood, was spacious, and in the center was a large bed that looked like it had been carved out of a large black rock.

The sheets covering the bed were blood-red, and several large and small cushions, also red in color, were piled on top of them.

The floor was covered with a long, black, shaggy carpet that looked like night, a red bed floating on a dark abyss.

<blank>

Three women were lying on the bed, their limbs intertwined with each other's as if folded on top of each other, breathing sweetly.

<blank>

"Mr. Halbert, you made me very happy. ......, ugh, good for you."

<blank>

A pale blue-skinned woman, her hair unbound on her head and flowing like a silver river on the red bed, gulped down a glass of red liquid and spoke gleefully.

<blank>

I hope you've had enough fun to last you until morning. ......

<blank>

A woman with golden blonde hair in loose waves mutters as she exhales with her hand on her cheek, listening intently to the faint, broken screams that leak from the depths of the rock.

<blank>

I don't care what it takes to keep Master Halbert happy. ......

<blank>

The brown-skinned woman lies on her back, tilts the glass up to her face, and lets the red liquid fall into her mouth, her ample breasts rippling in the dusk as she slurps and swallows.

The woman muttered as she let her long, untied black hair fall to the floor from the edge of the bed.

<blank>

All the women had taken off their outward appearances and were dressed in thin, white fabrics, like loungewear.

It is similar to the chiton worn by the ancient Greeks, which is a piece of cloth folded and fastened at the shoulders with metal fittings and tied around the body with a single cord.

The fabric is thin like lace, and the area of the fabric itself is not large, so the sides are wide open and the hem is short, exposing most of the thighs.

<blank>

The brown-skinned woman known as Joel caught the last drop of water dripping from the raised and tipped glass with her long, outstretched red tongue before continuing.

<blank>

Yes, ......, whatever that bitch thinks she's doing, as long as she can get Master Halbert to enjoy it!"

<blank>

Joel spit out the words in disgust, threw away the empty glass, pulled a large cushion aside, and rested his upper body on it with his elbows on the cushion and his right side down.

Then, the woman called Elektra moved smoothly to Joel's side and leaned in so that she was facing him.

<blank>

I'm sure you'll agree with me. No matter how much you don't like it, they are still higher beings than we are, aren't they?

<blank>

Elektra placed her right index finger on Joel's lips, then continued to trace her breast slowly with her fingernail, murmuring quietly, as if gently admonishing him.

<blank>

"...... say so, and even you, you ......, that guy, that guy! How can you admit that Clarimonde?

"You're silly. ......, hey? Joel?"

<blank>

Elektra gently cradles Joel's face in her hands and gently licks away with her long red tongue the traces of red liquid that dripped from her mouth and remained on Joel's face.

<blank>

Do you really think I would accept a woman like that?"

<blank>

Electra licks off the rest with her long, lizard-like tongue, and then continues on with her words, holding Joel close and running her hands over his body as if to confirm his presence.

<blank>

He has given his body and soul to a lowly human being. He says that he will give his body only as he is told.

<blank>

I'm not kidding!　As she continued, Elektra's hand clawed out sharply from behind her back and dug into Joel's brown skin.

Joel turned himself around and let out a small scream.

<blank>

But that is what Master Halbert wanted ......

<blank>

I heard such mutterings from their feet.

It was a murmur uttered by Marina, the pale blue-skinned woman whose legs were entwined with Joel's and whose thighs were stroked up.

Hearing this, they look at Marina in surprise for a moment, but then immediately raise their eyebrows in frustration and avert their gazes.

<blank>

But! But I'd go to ......! All of me belongs to Master Halbert! I wouldn't give myself to anyone but Master Halbert! I can't think of anything else!"

<blank>

They told me to turn it in. ......　And Joel turns to the side and spits out the words in frustration.

<blank>

You're a good girl, ......, here, have some more."

<blank>

Marina then reaches for the round table next to the bed.

On a round table with a black board set beside the bed was a large glass decanter with a pool of red liquid at the bottom of the container.

The amount of liquid remaining is about one or two glasses, which is a fraction of the capacity of the entire decanter.

<blank>

Above the open mouth of the decanter hung a single chain.

The chain is about a meter long, and it hangs from a large, curly, fat mass of chains further up.

<blank>

Marina keeps her hand on the decanter and squints at the mass of chains that looks like a cocoon encasing something.

Then the chain began to move in a gripping and spinning manner to tighten itself.

A sound like something being grinded leaked out from the chain, and a red liquid, as if squeezed out, dripped down the hanging chain into the decanter and collected there.

<blank>

I wonder if this is the last time I'll see you at ......."

<blank>

Marina muttered as she watched the glassful of wine being poured into the decanter.

With the decanter in her hands, Marina straddled Joel's body and moved her hips up to Joel's chest in a nursey motion, increasing the degree of contact.

<blank>

See, take it in stride, will you?"

<blank>

With that, Marina tilted the decanter over Joel's face and yukked up the red liquid.

Joel, whose chest was held back and his body was unable to rise, stretched out his neck and opened his mouth wide to catch it.

The red tongue is also stretched out long enough not to spill even a drop.

<blank>

Marina tilts the decanter around to play with Joel's mouth, and then she pours the wine into the decanter in an agitated manner.

Joel gulps down a mouthful of the poured product with his mouth open, gulping and slurping, savoring the full mouthful of liquid.

<blank>

Even so, not a few of them spilled out of her mouth, and Elektra, in her haste to save them, licked them off one after another.

Eventually it reached the liquid stream pouring into Joel's mouth and began to extend its tongue directly into it.

<blank>

Marina, seeing this, muttered, "I have no choice," with narrowed eyes, and poured the remaining contents of the decanter into her mouth.

He tosses the empty decanter, and then puts his hands directly on Electra's head and leads her to his lap, where he sits on the bed.

On Marina's thigh, Marina drops a mouthful of red liquid into Electra's mouth with her head turned up.

<blank>

Elektra catches the dripping liquid in her mouth and swallows it down enthusiastically.

But soon, that was not enough, he lifted his head, pressed his mouth to receive it directly from Marina's mouth, and began to slurp.

As they devour each other's mouths, Joel licks off the red drops that drip from them and extends his tongue to their mouths, as if wanting to share his own.

Rivers of silver, gold, and black mingle and melt on the red sheets.

Inside the red tent, the smell of sweltering blood, bodily fluids, and women filled the air, and their feverish voices echoed and intertwined with each other.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

With a thud, the empty decanter, which had fallen to the floor, was placed on the black round table.

At the sudden presence, the three women quickly left the scene and fell back on the bed.

<blank>

Were you having fun with ......?"

<blank>

And with a quiet look in her eyes, a woman in a garnet dress, redder and deeper than blood, uttered the words.

<blank>

K, Clarimond ..................

<blank>

Marina was on all fours on the bed, jittering back like a wary quadruped, looking up at Clarimonde and muttering.

Clarimonde quietly shifts her gaze from the decanter on the round table to the three people on the bed.

<blank>

The shiny platinum blonde hair parted neatly from the top of the head to the left and right, flowing down to the chest, further increasing the luster of the hair.

The garnet dress that envelops her translucent white porcelain skin is wide open at the shoulders and chest, generously showing off her overflowing, abundant twin dunes.

Her eyes, deep and slitted like statues, glared coldly at the three people on the bed.

<blank>

Looking up at its unrealistically shaped, beautiful face, Marina realizes that she has been admiring it for a moment.

Marina came to herself and bit her lip in frustration and looked away.

<blank>

Clarimonde's eyes, which had been sky-blue, began to glow and eventually emitted a golden glow.

Looking down at them with those golden eyes, the three women huddle together on the red sheets and back away further.

<blank>

I thought it was time to finish up, so I came to see how you are doing."

<blank>

Clarimonde spins her words in a gentle voice, sweet and quiet, like rolling a bell.

The women felt a chill rise up their spines as they silently huddled to listen to the voice.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Marina got off the bed and stood up, and the kitten-like loungewear she was wearing slipped off her feet.

With nothing to wear, she stepped forward, her long silvery-white hair swinging, and from the shadows at her feet, a group of maid-like figures, all dressed in white, appeared.

The white maids combed Marina's hair, put it up, and dressed her.

<blank>

There is already no Clarimonde in the place.

The tension in the air disappeared, and the women got off the beds and began to get ready as they pleased.

Elektra and Joel are also standing bare-headed, while the white maids are getting ready for the day.

<blank>

It's been well past midnight, that's for sure.

<blank>

The belt of the bondage tightened as if it was eating into her flesh, and Marina muttered a small "hmm!　Marina muttered, letting out a gasp.

<blank>

I don't want to keep our guests waiting too long," he said. Besides, there was a beautiful lady who looked delicious ....... ......

<blank>

Electra said with a bewitching smile, running her tongue over her fingers as she slipped into a black nightdress.

<blank>

'Elektra, please, tonight, don't straddle me from one side to the other, okay?

<blank>

Joel, whose hair was tied up and draped in a long knot, sighed and threw the words at Elektra.

<blank>

What do you say? It's a woman's duty to be with the right man, isn't it?"

But please don't make us spend three or four days on this like we did when we destroyed the orc settlements and the homes of the ogres.

There's nothing more beautiful than a dying man, Joel. There's nothing more beautiful than a dying man, Joel?

<blank>

Elektra clutched her own shoulder, licked up her own lips with her long, outstretched tongue, and spilled the words with an ecstatic expression.

Joel looked back at Elektra with a dazed look in his eyes, "I'm not happy to be connected to an orc. ......

<blank>

Joel, are you sure you want to keep getting bladed again in your flimsy clothes? Even if you're having fun, ......, you should go easy on yourself."

<blank>

Elektra stroked Joel's bare abdomen with her fingertips, whispering in disgust that he had such a beautiful body.

Joel twitched slightly at the movement of Elektra's fingers, but immediately turned to the side and muttered shyly, "It's good, isn't it? ......

<blank>

Now that you're all packed up, let's go, shall we? "Well, if you're done, why don't we go? Our guests are waiting for us.

<blank>

Marina puts her hands around their waists from behind and calls out to them happily.

The three of them looked each other in the eye, smiled pleasantly, and stepped forward together with light steps, as if they were heading for a glittering social gathering.

<blank>

Bwari, the wind scatters inside the red tent.

The white maids hung their heads deeply toward the exit of the tent.

In a tent with no sound except for a slight breeze rustling, the white maids sink into the shadows at their feet, their heads hanging down.

<blank>

The red tent, which had lost all sound and movement, stood silently in the black cave.

But from the depths of the cave, the smell of gruesome blood and a deathly wind blows through the air.

<blank>

Echoing from the deepest depths of the rock were the alternating, faint, interrupted sounds of sobs and screams filled with fright and despair, and the plaintive, muffled cries of a daughter in the service of the gods.

Eventually, the wind carrying that despair leaves the cave and is swallowed up by the vindictive voices of the fearless number of departed that fill the plains.

<blank>

It was a place of demise for the living. It was the realm of the dead, where the living could not exist.

Thank you for reading!

I'm really glad to hear your buzz and appreciation!

<blank>

Since the yuri expressions are no longer "flavorful" (or were they already?), I'll add "girls' love" to the list (^^ Isuzu). I'll add "girls' love" to the list.

<blank>

Hopefully the next one will be up by the end of July....
