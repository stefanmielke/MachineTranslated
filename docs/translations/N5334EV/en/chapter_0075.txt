# Episode 70: Whispers of the Dark Forest

Thank you for your patience.

<b>

There are extremely cruel expressions and yuri depictions.

Those who are not comfortable or feel discomfort, please be cautious.

<b>

Lisa was lifted by the chains wrapped around her right ankle, her left leg weakly spread apart, and her robe was rolled up and hanging down, exposing her thighs indecently.

The woman entwined in chains lifted Lisa's leg to her face level, brought her nose close, sniffing and joyfully exclaiming about the scent of a maiden.

<b>

"Look, a maiden who still doesn't know a man! And a holy one! A saint, a saint! Lord Halbert will be pleased!"

<b>

"Marina. The maiden is fine, but that saint, won't she die soon like this? With such a big hole in her belly, she's losing quite a bit of blood, you know? What a waste. She must stay alive until we deliver her to Lord Halbert. Well, even if she's dead, we can still enjoy her, but since she's a maiden, shouldn't we enjoy her while she's alive?"

<b>

The woman in black stood beside Lisa, sensually tracing her fingers along Lisa's right leg while speaking to the woman she called Marina.

<b>

Marina murmured in agreement with the black-clad woman's words, then slowly grabbed the chain coming from Lisa's back and yanked it out forcefully.

<b>

"Ygggghhhhhh!!"

<b>

Lisa's desperate scream echoed around.

<b>

"Hehe, what a nice voice♪ Did it hurt? Hehe..."

<b>

Marina squinted her eyes in delight and looked down at Lisa's face, still hanging. She then extended her right hand and roughly tore away the front of the hanging robe.

<b>

"Ahhhh!!"

<b>

Lisa screamed.

Her exposed lower abdomen was overflowing with blood, and the white panties that should have been there were dyed bright red with the spilled blood, while blood gushed endlessly from the wound below her navel.

<b>

Marina placed her right hand on it and began to sensually stroke the wound.

<b>

"Ygg! No... no! Ahh!"

<b>

Lisa squirmed and screamed even more.

<b>

"See, I've closed the hole, so you'll have to wait a bit, okay?"

<b>

When Marina removed her hand from Lisa's lower abdomen, the wound was already gone.

Marina then began to happily lick the blood of Lisa that was on her hand with her long, extended tongue.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Did the vampire use healing?!"

"Dammit! Lisa! Just wait! I'm coming to save you!!"

"Don't rush, Kyle!! Cornell!! Form the solid squad!! Get the non-combatants back!!"

<b>

Tony shouted in surprise, while Cedric restrained Kyle, who was about to jump out, without taking his eyes off the vampires and directing the rear troops.

<b>

"Conrad!!"

"Got it!"

<b>

Howard and Conrad kicked the ground again and charged toward the enemy in front of them. Their target was the woman entwined in chains, the vampire called Marina.

They aimed to wipe her out in one go and rescue the captives.

<b>

Noticing the two approaching, Marina smiled suspiciously, and the chains surrounding her swayed and reached up toward the two.

Multiple chains approached like spears toward the two, but Conrad raised the massive battle axe he held in front of him and began to spin it as if twirling a baton made of twigs.

With a roar, the double-bladed battle axe, slicing through the surrounding air, deflected, entangled, and severed the chains that were rushing toward them.

<b>

Howard slipped through the gap created by the scattered chains and rushed toward Marina in one breath.

He swung the "Grand Divider," enveloped in a pale blue light, over his left shoulder and shot it down toward the woman without any hesitation.

Marina's smile vanished, and her gaze turned serious for an instant. Just as it seemed the black blade would reach her, a loud metallic sound echoed, and sparks flew around.

<b>

"Huh?"

"What?!"

<b>

Howard's black great sword had pierced the ground.

In that moment, Marina jumped back further, entangled with the victims in chains.

<b>

"Did I lose the contest?!"

<b>

The brown-skinned woman raised her great sword to block Howard's downward strike but was instead knocked back along with her great sword.

She spun around to kill the momentum and faced Howard again, her eyes wide in disbelief.

<b>

"Joel! Get back!!"

<b>

Responding to the voice from behind, the brown-skinned woman quickly stepped back, and a faint green sword flash swept through the spot where she had just been.

As the shimmering green eye patch glimmered, Gilbert continued to pursue the brown-skinned woman called Joel with successive sword and dagger strikes.

<b>

However, in the next moment, several fireballs were rapidly shot toward Gilbert.

Gilbert narrowly dodged them, but the fireballs that missed exploded into the ground.

Each fireball had enough power to blow off a limb if it hit an ordinary human.

<b>

"Tch! Unnecessary interference, Electra!"

"Oh? You seemed to be struggling, Joel?"

"Hmph! Marina! Did you catch any extras?!"

"Hehe, a few got away, but I've caught three more!"

<b>

At those words, Howard and the others were taken aback.

While Howard and the others were engaged in battle with three vampires, a fierce struggle was unfolding between the enchanted chains and the knights in the rear.

<b>

In the back, several members of the knight squad had fallen, and many non-combatants from the logistics team were also lying on the ground, groaning in pain.

Around them, many severed chains writhed like snakes, eventually dissolving into a mist of blood that disappeared into the air.

<b>

Cedric was cutting down several chains that were approaching Joseline, who was on a stretcher with the three doctors.

Tony and Kyle were also on guard around the three doctors and repeatedly clashed with the chains that were moving erratically beside Cedric.

Magritte and Lysa also pushed back the chains approaching them with the help of Simon and others.

Yet, even so, there were still casualties among them.

<b>

"Did you deceive our eyes?!"

"I apologize, my lord, my eyes failed to catch it."

"Howard! These guys are not to be underestimated!!"

<b>

Determined not to let anything slip by any longer, the three lined up and readied themselves with sharp gazes.

<b>

The chains rattled as they hung up, and the still-burning trees' flames flickered, illuminating new victims emerging from the depths of the forest's darkness.

One was a knight in armor who had lost consciousness. The other two were members of the logistics team dressed in work overalls.

One of them still seemed to be conscious, letting out muffled groans and small screams.

All three were still young girls.

<b>

"You bastards!!"

<b>

Howard gritted his teeth.

<b>

"Now then, I’m very sorry to leave, but my master is waiting, so I must take my leave soon."

"Do you think we’ll let you escape like this?!!"

<b>

Conrad shouted, kicking the ground in response to the words of the woman in black called Electra.

At that moment, the brown-skinned woman called Joel snapped her fingers.

In the next instant, a deafening roar split the ground, and a black wall rose up between Howard and the women.

<b>

What rose from the ground was not a wall but a massive skeletal structure reminiscent of a reptile.

Three of them stood up, pushing up from the earth, blocking the way like a wall before the three.

<b>

Howard and the others instinctively jumped back to create distance.

<b>

"...Nuh?! Another 'Old Scale Dinosaur'?!"

<b>

Conrad muttered, looking up at it with a tense gaze.

<b>

The "Old Scale Dinosaur" was an undead theropod.

Its skeletal structure, pulled up from the ancient era, was stained with a murky yellow-brown and showed signs of erosion, with many bones chipped away.

Standing at about 14 to 15 meters long, its massive thigh bones supported its body, and its long skull, about the height of a person, was lined with knife-like fangs, indicating that its owner was clearly carnivorous.

It resembled a T-Rex-like carnivorous dinosaur. Its threat level was 125. If several appeared, it would be impossible for the knight squad alone to contain them.

The two that appeared at dusk had mowed down many knight squad members and swallowed several non-combatants whole.

However, Howard, Conrad, and Gilbert had defeated them.

<b>

But now, what appeared before them was clearly different from the previous ones.

It was larger than the earlier ones, and its body shone with a black brilliance as if made of obsidian.

<b>

"Conrad! This is clearly different from the one we crushed in the evening! Be on guard!!"

<b>

Howard shouted to Conrad to be cautious.

<b>

"It was a gift from my master for our use, you know?"

<b>

Isn't it lovely? The woman in black called Electra spoke to Howard and the others while sitting sideways on the skull, stroking it.

<b>

"I want to play a little longer, though..."

<b>

The brown-skinned woman called Joel said regretfully, pushing her bangs back while straddling the skull.

<b>

"Delivering the meal comes first, you know? We can take our time afterward... right?"

<b>

The woman called Marina, who was entwined in chains, said quietly with a smile as she looked down at Howard and the others.

<b>

"So, I’m telling you that we won’t let you escape!!"

<b>

As Conrad kicked the ground again, the three ancient dragon bones lowered their massive jaws and roared like dragons.

The sound was lower and heavier than any brass instrument, vibrating the ground and air, creating a gust around them.

<b>

Conrad was swept away by the vibrations and was flung backward.

<b>

"...You bastards!!"

<b>

Conrad, having planted his feet firmly, was hit first by one of his signature howl attacks and grinned fiercely, clenching his teeth in frustration.

<b>

"I'll visit again after midnight. Until then, it's a brief farewell."

<b>

Electra raised one hand from atop the black skull and began to concentrate her magical power.

The magic turned into flames, and the palm that Electra raised began to spin like a bowl. The density of the magic increased further, and it began to emit a brightness that was almost blinding.

<b>

"Not good! Conrad, get down!! Cedric—! Brace yourself—!!!"

<b>

With a series of explosive sounds, light burst forth, and countless fireballs were shot indiscriminately around.

<b>

The fireballs that hit the ground exploded, creating large holes in the earth, while those that struck trees bored holes and knocked them down, setting them ablaze.

When they hit the wall created by the knights, it gouged the wall material as if it had been shot, creating craters of various sizes.

Anyone hit would have limbs blown off with just a graze, and even the heavily armored knights wouldn't escape unscathed if they took a direct hit.

In an instant, the area transformed into a scene reminiscent of a battlefield that had been bombed.

<b>

"Well then, everyone, take care. Please prepare for the party before you return. I’m looking forward to it..."

<b>

After the bombardment of fireballs subsided, along with the three massive black dragon bones, the three vampires vanished, leaving only the sound of their laughter echoing in the darkness of the forest.

<b>

<b>

Cedric Meyer lowered his kite shield, which was still smoking from blocking the fireballs, and knelt on one knee, looking around.

The ground was still smoking from the many craters, and the fallen trees were illuminated by the flames surrounding them.

The barricades and walls created by the logistics team had collapsed by about a third and were also smoking.

Most of the knights had sustained damage and were groaning in pain. Some had received serious injuries, bleeding and unable to move.

<b>

"……Did they really half-destroy the knight squad with just one attack?"

<b>

With a look of disbelief, Cedric Meyer turned his gaze toward the depths of the forest where the vampires had disappeared.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

A rough plain swarming with the living dead, surrounded by towering black walls.

And, as if looking down on those dead, a single cave pierced through the black wall.

<b>

Inside that entrance, a slightly spacious area opened up.

The space, which spread like a small hall, was supported by several pillars of rock stacked over time.

The surrounding walls were also piled up like waves of black rock, formed over an eternity.

It was a majestic space reminiscent of a temple from another world.

<b>

As soon as one stepped into that hall, a massive tent made of thick red fabric occupied the space.

The blood-red velvet fabric, hanging from the ceiling of the hall, draped in layers, showing an overwhelming presence in the black space.

<b>

The black pillars and walls contrasted with the red velvet tent, resembling a giant pool of blood invading a black temple.

That place was entirely detached from reality.

<b>

Inside that blood-like tent was spacious, with a large bed seemingly carved from black rock placed in the center.

The sheets covering the bed were also blood-red, and various red cushions were piled on top.

The floor was covered with a long-haired black carpet, making the red bed appear to float above the dark abyss.

<b>

On the bed lay three women, intertwined with each other, exhaling sweet breaths as they rested.

<b>

"Lord Halbert was so pleased... Hehe, I'm glad."

<b>

A woman with pale blue skin, who had let down her hair that had been tied up, drank from a glass filled with red liquid and said happily.

<b>

"I hope you enjoy it enough to last until morning..."

<b>

With a sigh, she placed her hand on her cheek, listening to the faint, intermittent, delicate screams leaking from deep within the rock, while a woman with golden blonde hair in loose waves murmured.

<b>

"I just want Lord Halbert to be satisfied with anything..."

<b>

The brown-skinned woman tilted her head back, pouring the red liquid from the glass she held into her mouth, causing her ample bosom to ripple as she swallowed.

The women had all shed the outfits they had worn outside and donned white, thin, room-like garments.

They resembled the chitons worn by ancient Greeks, made from a single piece of fabric folded and fastened at the shoulder with a clasp, tied around the waist with a single cord.

The fabric was thin like lace, and since the area of the fabric was not large, it was cut high on the sides, revealing most of their thighs.

<b>

After catching the last drop dripping from the glass she had tilted, the brown-skinned woman called Joel continued speaking.

<b>

"That's right... No matter what that damn woman intends, if it pleases Lord Halbert, then!"

<b>

As Joel spat out those words with disdain, she tossed the empty glass aside and pulled a larger cushion beside her, resting her elbow on it and leaning her upper body to the right.

Then, the woman called Electra smoothly moved beside Joel, leaning in to face her.

<b>

"Be careful with your words, Joel. No matter how displeased you may be, she is, after all, a higher being than us, you know?"

<b>

Electra placed her right index finger on Joel's lips and then slowly traced her finger down her chest, gently admonishing her in a soft voice.

<b>

"...But you, can you really accept her? Her! Clarimond?!"

"You're such a fool... right? Joel?"

<b>

Electra gently cupped Joel's face with both hands and began to lick away the red liquid that dripped from the corners of her mouth with her long, red tongue.

<b>

"Do you think I would ever accept a woman like that?"

<b>

As she continued to lick away the remaining traces with her lizard-like long tongue, Electra pulled Joel closer, her hands roaming over her body as she continued her words.

<b>

"That woman is devoted body and soul to a base human. She simply offers her body as she is told."

<b>

"That's not a joke!" Electra continued, extending her sharp nails behind Joel's back and digging into her brown skin.

Joel arched her back, letting out a small scream.

<b>

"But that was what Lord Halbert desired..."

<b>

From below the two, a whisper was heard.

It was Marina, the pale blue-skinned woman who had been entwined with Joel's legs, stroking her thighs.

Hearing that, the two momentarily looked at Marina in surprise but quickly frowned in regret and averted their gazes.

<b>

"But! But I...! Everything I have belongs to Lord Halbert! I can't even think of offering myself to anyone else!"

<b>

Even if they told me to offer myself...! Joel said, turning sideways and expressing her regret.

<b>

"You're such a hopeless girl... Here, have a little more."

<b>

Saying this, Marina reached for a round table beside the bed.

On the round table with a black surface was a large glass decanter, and at the bottom of the container was red liquid.

The remaining amount of liquid was about one or two glasses, but considering the total capacity of the decanter, it was just a tiny bit.

<b>

A chain hung down from the open mouth of the decanter.

The chain was about a meter long and hung down from a large, coiled mass of chains above.

<b>

Marina glanced at the coiled mass of chains, which looked like it was wrapping something, while keeping her hand on the decanter.

Then, the chains began to move, tightening as if to crush something inside.

As a sound like something being ground leaked out, red liquid that seemed to have been squeezed from the chains dripped down and filled the decanter.

<b>

"...Is this the last of it?"

<b>

Marina murmured as she watched the amount of liquid equal to a glass pour into the decanter.

Holding the decanter, Marina straddled Joel's body, increasing their closeness, and smoothly moved her hips down to Joel's chest.

<b>

"Now, make sure to catch it, okay?"

<b>

Saying this, Marina tilted the decanter over Joel's face, slowly dripping the red liquid.

Unable to fully rise due to Marina pressing down on her chest, Joel stretched her neck and opened her mouth wide to catch it.

Not wanting to spill a single drop, she extended her red tongue as well.

<b>

Marina toyed with Joel's mouth, tilting the decanter and teasingly dripping the liquid.

Joel gulped, savoring the liquid filling her mouth, and gradually swallowed it down.

<b>

Even so, there was still plenty spilling from her mouth, which Electra hurriedly leaned in to catch, licking up the drips one after another.

Eventually, this extended to the flow of liquid pouring into Joel's mouth, and she began to stretch her tongue directly to catch it.

<b>

Seeing this, Marina sighed and squinted her eyes, murmuring, "You’re hopeless," as she took the remaining contents of the decanter into her mouth.

Throwing the now-empty decanter aside, she placed both hands on Electra's head and guided her to sit on her lap.

On Marina's thighs, with her head tilted back, Electra eagerly received the red liquid that dripped from Marina's mouth.

However, she soon found it unsatisfactory and raised her head, pressing her mouth against Marina's to receive directly, starting to gulp.

As the two devoured each other's mouths, Joel licked up the red drops that dripped from them, stretching her tongue toward their mouths as if to say she wanted some too.

On the red sheets, rivers of silver, gold, and black intertwined and melted together.

The inside of the red tent was filled with a suffocating mix of blood, bodily fluids, and the scent of the women, resonating with heated voices as they intertwined.

<b>

<b>

<b>

With a clatter, the empty decanter that had fallen to the floor was placed on the black round table.

Suddenly sensing a presence, the three women instinctively moved away from the bed, stepping back.

<b>

"Were you enjoying yourselves...?"

<b>

A woman clad in a deep garnet dress, even redder than blood, spoke with a calm gaze.

<b>

"Y-Your Grace... Clarimond..."

<b>

Marina murmured as she crouched on the bed, cautiously backing away like a wary beast, looking up at Clarimond.

Clarimond quietly shifted her gaze from the decanter on the round table to the three women on the bed.

<b>

Her shining platinum blonde hair was neatly parted from the crown of her head, flowing down to her chest, increasing its luster.

The garnet dress enveloping her porcelain-like skin was cut low at the shoulders and chest, unabashedly revealing her ample bosom.

Her deep, statue-like eyes glared coldly at the three women on the bed.

<b>

Marina, who had been gazing up at that otherworldly beauty, suddenly realized she had been captivated by it.

Startled back to reality, Marina bit her lip in regret and averted her gaze.

<b>

Clarimond's sky-blue eyes began to shine, eventually radiating a golden glow.

As the three women were looked down upon by those golden eyes, they huddled together on the red sheets, backing away even further.

<b>

"I thought it was about time for the finishing touches, so I came to check on you."

<b>

Clarimond spoke in a sweet, gentle voice, like the sound of rolling bells.

The women felt a chill run down their spines at her voice, quietly huddling closer, listening intently.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

As Marina stepped down from the bed, the chiton-like garment she had been wearing slipped down to her feet.

With nothing on her body, she stepped forward, her long silver hair swaying as figures resembling maids clad entirely in white emerged from the shadows at her feet.

The white maids began to comb Marina's hair, gathering it up and dressing her.

<b>

Clarimond's figure was already gone from the scene.

The tense atmosphere dissipated, and the women began to descend from the bed, preparing themselves.

Electra and Joel, also standing bare-skinned, were diligently dressed by the white maids.

<b>

"Indeed, it's already quite late into the night."

<b>

As the bondage belt tightened around her flesh, Marina let out a small "Hmm!" as she murmured.

<b>

"We can't keep our guests waiting too long. Besides, there were some delicious... handsome gentlemen among them..."

<b>

While donning a black nightdress, Electra ran her finger along her tongue, smiling seductively as she spoke.

<b>

"Electra, please, for tonight, can you refrain from jumping on every man you see?"

<b>

With her hair gathered and tied back, Joel sighed as she spoke to Electra.

<b>

"Oh? To be united with a lovely gentleman is a woman's true desire, you know?"

"Even so, please don't take three or four days like you did when you were destroying the orc village or the ogres' lair."

"The men who are about to die are the most wonderful things, Joel. I will embrace that moment... Ah, it's the ultimate bliss."

<b>

Electra hugged herself, licking her lips with her long tongue, expressing her ecstasy.

Joel looked back at Electra with an exasperated expression, thinking, "I wouldn't be happy even if I connected with an orc..."

<b>

"Joel, are you really planning to keep wearing that skimpy outfit and keep taking hits? No matter how fun it is... please be moderate?"

<b>

Electra said with a hint of exasperation, tracing her fingers over Joel's exposed abdomen, whispering, "Such a beautiful body."

Joel slightly twisted her body at Electra's touch but quickly turned away, muttering shyly, "What's wrong with that...?"

<b>

"Now, if you're ready, let's go? If we don't hurry, the night will break. Our guests are waiting, you know?"

<b>

Marina wrapped her arms around the waists of the two from behind, cheerfully encouraging them.

The three exchanged glances, sharing joyful smiles, and stepped forward together with light steps toward the dazzling social gathering.

<b>

A gust of wind swept through the red tent.

The white maids bowed deeply toward the exit of the tent.

Aside from the slight breeze, the tent was silent, and the white maids sank into the shadows at their feet, heads still bowed.

<b>

The red tent, devoid of sound and movement, stood quietly in the black cave.

Yet from the depths of the cave came the horrific scent of blood and the wind laden with death.

<b>

From the innermost depths of the rock echoed the sobs and screams filled with fear and despair from the daughters serving the gods, alternating with high-pitched cries, faint and intermittent.

Eventually, as the wind carrying that despair flowed out of the cave, it was swallowed by the horrendous voices of the countless vengeful spirits filling the plain.

<b>

That place was the end for the living. A realm of the dead where the living could not exist.

Thank you for reading!

Bookmarks and evaluations truly make me happy!!

<b>

The yuri expressions have gone beyond "flavor" (or had they already?), so I’ll add "Girls Love" to it. (^^ゞ

I hope to upload the next chapter by July...
