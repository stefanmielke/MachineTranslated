# Episode 2: Suzy Feels Surprise

For the time being, no one other than the protagonist will appear＾＾；

----------------

<b>

A part of the forest was gouged out, emitting white smoke.

<b>

“No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no, no!”

<b>

Seeing the “mark” I created again made me freak out.

<b>

“It’s just a dash skill, right?! It’s a skill with no attack power?!”

<b>

The target was no longer a fragment.

<b>

“Eh~~? Why? Is it because the level difference with the mob is too great? Even so, it’s too flashy just because it’s a dream, right?!”

<b>

With a crunching sound, the gouged and shattered trees began to collapse.

<b>

“That mob was like a big bear… I think I could tell its name when I targeted it, but it blew up right away.”

<b>

Was it something like Nanto Bear? I muttered while letting a bead of sweat fall, as if to turn my eyes away from the gruesome scene I had created.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Startled by the resounding loud noise, many creatures fled the scene.

<b>

However, among them, there were those who were instead drawn to it.

Those who recognized themselves as “strong beings.”

<b>

<b>

They were irritated; the sudden shock and loud noise had wounded their pride.

<b>

If they followed their instincts as living beings, they should swiftly distance themselves from any perceived threat.

That would be fine for a beast without wisdom, but they were “strong beings.”

They could not leave the source of the threat unchallenged.

<b>

They needed to make it known to their opponent who they had bared their fangs at.

<b>

Without hiding their anger, they hurried toward the direction of the sound.

<b>

<b>

When they confirmed the location, they felt surprise once again.

Not at the devastation, but at the being that was there.

A being that should not be in such a place.

A “human” they would normally have to go far from here, to the edge of the forest, to encounter.

<b>

Moreover, a “young female.”

<b>

<b>

They felt their surprise and irritation transform into delight.

At this point, the identity and cause of the loud noise no longer mattered.

Before them was a rare and exquisite prey.

<b>

<b>

A “human” could be easily subdued.

Though there were occasionally those who wielded weapons, their meager blades could hardly scratch their fur.

It would be over with just a grip of their legs.

Moreover, these creatures would make noise as soon as claws lightly dug into their flesh.

Especially the sounds made by “females” were incredibly delightful.

<b>

They would extract plenty of sounds and savor them before feasting on the flesh.

Imagining the feast they could enjoy, their mouth, equipped with massive fangs reminiscent of a saber-toothed tiger, twisted in a grin.

<b>

<b>

A massive form reminiscent of a black feline, reaching five meters, slowly sank into the ground as if crawling.

Two tentacles extending from its shoulders trembled, and as its golden eyes narrowed, its presence began to fade.

<b>

【Invisibility】インヴィジビリティ

By manipulating magical power, one can blend their existence into the space, making it impossible for others to recognize them.

A “human” could never find them.

<b>

There were those who could detect with magical power, but this could not be captured by a “human’s” level of magical energy.

They would pin down their prey and reveal themselves while digging in their claws.

Surely, they would produce a very delicious sound.

And with that cold pleasure, they leaped toward their prey.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

They opened their body to the right, twisting their upper body and swinging their arm as if throwing, slamming the blade down.

With a flashy explosion, the creature that had leaped at them burst apart.

<b>

“Whoa!”

<b>

Like a burst water balloon, black fur and flesh scattered everywhere.

<b>

“Ugh, it exploded again… It really is a grand overkill. Was that one called ‘Kuar Jaguar’? I wonder if the mobs around here are at the initial village level?”

<b>

They muttered to themselves while gazing at the splattered flesh, brain matter, and fragments of internal organs.

<b>

(This is quite a gruesome scene… but strangely, I’m okay with it? Am I really resistant to gore? It must be because it’s a dream.)

<b>

They were satisfied with that thought.

<b>

“But it seems I’ve figured out how to use the skill!”

<b>

It seemed that skills existed as images in their consciousness.

There were no icons like in a game screen.

It appeared that if they consciously wished to use a skill, it would activate.

It was almost like choosing whether to throw a straight punch or a hook.

<b>

“Using magic feels similar, right? For now, let’s enchant it.”

<b>

Saying that, they raised both hands above their head while still holding the sword and began to dance as if swaying.

A whisper-like chant leaked from their mouth.

As if in sync with the chant, the sounds of instruments began to resonate.

<b>

Horns, lutes, harps, drums, guitars, organs—various instruments were played by small fairies that appeared and began to perform.

<b>

HP, MP increase and recovery values, attack, magic, speed, physical and magical defense, evasion, critical hit occurrence and damage, movement speed, resistance to various attributes, resistance to mental and physical abnormalities.

One after another, their physical abilities significantly increased.

<b>

<b>

(I can use magic in a similar way. Moreover, it seems I can set it up like a macro? Should I try out skill combos too…?)

<b>

Eventually, the small fairies that had finished their performance disappeared.

<b>

“Although a lot scattered due to that loud noise earlier, there are still quite a few mobs nearby.”

<b>

Looking around and using their own exploration ability to confirm the positions of the mobs.

<b>

They licked their upper lip with their tongue.

<b>

“Well then, let’s give it a little try!”

<b>

With a slightly confident smile, they dashed toward the nearest enemy.
