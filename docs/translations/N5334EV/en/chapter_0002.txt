# 02 Suzy Surprises

For the time being, there will be no other person than the main character;


----------------

<blank>

Parts of the forest were gutted and white smoke was rising.

<blank>

No, no, no." No, no, no, no, no!"

<blank>

I'm scared again when I see the "marks" I've made.

<blank>

It's just a dash move, you know? It's a skill with no offensive power.

<blank>

There is no longer a piece of what was the target.

<blank>

What? Why? Is it that there is too much difference in level between the mobs? Even if that's the case, it's too flashy just because it's a dream!

<blank>

With a crackling sound, the gutted trees collapsed.

<blank>

It was a big bear-like mob ....... It seemed to 'know' its name when it was tagged, ......, but it blew up so quickly."

<blank>

Was it Nantucka Bear?　he muttered, a single bead of sweat dripping down his face as he turned away from the devastation he had gutted.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Surprised by the loud noise that echoed through the area, many creatures fled away from the scene.

<blank>

However, some things are attracted by it.

Those who consider themselves "strong".

<blank>

<blank>

Sole was irritated, the sudden shock and loud noise upset Sole's pride.

<blank>

If we follow our instincts as living beings, if we feel threatened in any way, we should leave there as soon as possible.

That would be fine for a beast without wisdom, but it is a "strong man".

We cannot leave things that pose a threat to ourselves untouched.

<blank>

We need to let them know against whom they have turned their fangs.

<blank>

Sole made no attempt to hide his indignation and hurried his feet in the direction from which the sound originated.

<blank>

<blank>

When Sole confirmed its location, he was again surprised.

Not for the devastation, but for those who were there.

They are not supposed to be in a place like this.

It is a 'person' that you have to go farther from here, to the edge of this forest, to encounter.

<blank>

And they are 'young bitches.

<blank>

<blank>

Sole felt surprise and irritation turn to pleasure.

At the earliest, the identity and cause of the loud roar is unimportant.

Right in front of you is a rare and exquisite catch.

<blank>

<blank>

The 'people' can be easily suppressed.

Some of them have weapons, but their meager blades can't do much damage to our furs.

If you hold it back with your legs, that's it.

And they make a sound immediately with a light touch of their fingernails on their bodies.

The sound that the 'bitches' make is especially delicious.

<blank>

Let the sound be squeezed out of the tap, taste it as if you were sipping, and then eat the meat.

Thinking of the feast he is about to enjoy, his mouth, equipped with huge fangs reminiscent of a saber-toothed tiger, twists.

<blank>

<blank>

A huge body reminiscent of a black feline reaching five meters slowly sank to the ground.

The two tentacles extending from its shoulders tremble, and its golden eyes squint and narrow, and its presence fades away.

<blank>

[Hidden form] Invisibility

By manipulating magic power, he makes his presence dissolve into space, making it unrecognizable to others.

You'll never find it in a "person".

<blank>

There are those who can detect with magical power, but the amount of magical power of a "person" is not enough to capture this.

Let's let them appear while we continue to assemble them and eat their claws.

I'm sure it will sound very tasty.

and leapt at his prey with chilling glee.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The body is opened halfway to the right, the upper body is twisted, the arm is thrown around, and the blade is slammed in the grip.

With a loud popping sound, the thing that had jumped at him burst open.

<blank>

Whoopee!"

<blank>

Like a burst water balloon, black fur and flesh and blood splattered.

<blank>

'Uh oh, another bombing. ....... I knew it was a big overkill. ...... Was that guy just now named 'Quar Jaguar'? I wonder if the mobs around here are in the early village class?"

<blank>

I thought to myself as I looked at the splattered flesh and blood, brain plasma and internal organ fragments.

<blank>

(It's a pretty grotesque scene, but ......, you don't mind, do you? I have a high tolerance for grotesqueries? I guess it was just a dream.)

<blank>

I was convinced that such things were possible.

<blank>

But I think I know how to use my skills!"

<blank>

The skill seems to exist as an image in the consciousness.

There are no icons like on a game screen.

It seems that if you are aware of the skills you want to use, they will be activated.

It's almost like choosing whether to punch straight or hook.

<blank>

I wonder if it's the same with enchantment? Let's just enchant for now."

<blank>

With that said, he raised his hands above his head while holding his sword and began to sway and dance.

A whispered chant escapes from his mouth.

Then the sounds of musical instruments began to echo in time with the chanting.

<blank>

Horns, lutes, harps, drums, guitars, organs, and various other instruments are played by little elves.

<blank>

Increased HP, MP and recovery values, attack, magic, speed, physical-magical defense, evasion, critical generation and damage power, movement speed, resistance to various attributes, and resistance to mental and physical abnormalities.

and so on, with a series of significant increases in physical capabilities.

<blank>

<blank>

(I can use magic in the same way. And it seems like it can be set up and used like a macro set up? I'll try the skill combo too ......)

<blank>

Soon after the performance, the little fairies disappear.

<blank>

That loud noise just now scattered a lot of them, but there are still a lot of mobs nearby."

<blank>

He looks around and checks the location of the mob using his radar ...... and his own search ability.

<blank>

He licked his upper lip with his tongue perorally.

<blank>

Well, let's give it a try!

<blank>

With a slightly bullish smile on his face, he took off toward the nearest enemy.
