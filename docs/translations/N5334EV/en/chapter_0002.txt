# Episode 02 - Susie is surprised

For the time being, no one other than the main character appears ^^;

A part of the forest was gouged out and was billowing white smoke.

<blank>

"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

<blank>

I was scared when I saw the 'traces' I had made.

<blank>

"It's just a dash move, right? It's a skill with no attack power, right?!”

<blank>

There was not a single piece of the target left.

<blank>

"What? Why? Is it because there's too much of a level difference with the mob? Even if that's the case, it's too flashy for a dream, isn't it?

<blank>

The trees that had been gouged out with a cracking sound collapsed.

<blank>

“It was a Mob that looked like a huge bear... It seemed like I could 'understand' its name if I tagged it, but it blew up right away."

<blank>

I muttered, turning away from the devastation I had caused, and dripping with sweat.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Startled by the loud noise, many creatures fled away from the scene.

<blank>

However, there were also those who were drawn to it.

Those that consider themselves 'strong'.

<blank>

<blank>

It was irritated, the sudden shock and loud noise had shaken its pride.

<blank>

If you follow your instincts as a creature, if you sense some kind of threat, you should quickly move away.

That would be fine if it were a beast without wisdom, but it is a 'strong one'.

It cannot leave the thing that has threatened it as it is.

<blank>

It needs to make the other party aware of who it has turned its fangs on.

<blank>

It did not even try to hide its anger, and hurried towards the direction from which the sound had come.

<blank>

<blank>

When it confirmed the location, it was surprised all over again.

Not by the devastation, but by the person who was there.

Someone who should not be in a place like this.

Someone who could only be encountered if you went to the edge of the forest, which was much further away.

<blank>

And a 'young female' to boot.

<blank>

<blank>

It felt its surprise and irritation turn to joy.

It no longer cared about the identity or the cause of the loud noise.

It had the most exquisite prey in front of it, something it rarely saw.

<blank>

<blank>

'People' are easy to subdue.

Although there are the occasional ones who carry weapons, their puny blades can't even scratch our fur.

If you hold them down with your legs, that's the end of them.

Besides, these guys make noise as soon as you lightly scratch them with your claws.

The sound made by the female is especially delicious.

<blank>

Let them make plenty of noise, and then savor it as you would a sip of wine before eating the meat.

The mouth, with its huge fangs reminiscent of a sabre-toothed tiger, contorts as you think of the feast to come.

<blank>

<blank>

The huge body, reminiscent of a black cat that can reach five meters in length, slowly sank as if crawling along the ground.

The two tentacles that extended from the shoulder quivered, and as the golden eyes narrowed, its presence faded away.

<blank>

【Invisibility】 Invisibility

By manipulating magic, it blends its own existence into the space, making it impossible for others to perceive it.

It is impossible to find it with the human senses.

<blank>

There are those who use magic to detect it, but this cannot be detected with the magic power of a human.

I will make it appear while pinning it down and digging my claws into it.

It will surely make a very delicious sound.

He leapt at his prey, immersed in cold glee.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

He opened his body to the right, twisted his upper body, and threw his arm around, slamming the blade he was holding down.

The thing that had jumped at him with a loud popping sound burst open.

<blank>

“Uwaaah!“

<blank>

Black fur and blood splattered like a burst water balloon.

<blank>

”Aaaah, it exploded again... It's definitely an overkill. ...I wonder if the name of that one was 'Quar Jaguar'? Are the mobs around here just the initial village class?"

<blank>

He muttered to himself as he looked at the scattered blood, brain matter and pieces of internal organs.

<blank>

(It's quite a gruesome scene... but I'm not bothered by it? Am I really that tolerant of gore? It's just a dream, after all.)

<blank>

He was satisfied with this.

<blank>

"But I think I've figured out how to use the skills too!”

<blank>

It seems that skills exist as images in your consciousness.

There are no icons like in a game screen.

It seems that if you are aware that you want to use a skill, it will activate.

It's almost like choosing whether to punch straight or hook.

<blank>

“I wonder if using magic is the same? I'll just enchant it for now.”

<blank>

With that, he raised both hands above his head, holding his sword, and began to dance.

A whispering chant escaped from his mouth.

Then, as if in response to the chant, the sound of musical instruments began to echo.

<blank>

Fairies appeared, playing various instruments: horns, lutes, harps, drums, guitars, organs.

<blank>

HP, MP, recovery values, attack, magic, speed, physical magic defense, evasion, critical occurrence and damage, movement speed, resistance values for various attributes, resistance to mental and physical abnormalities.

Your physical abilities increase dramatically one after another.

<blank>

<blank>

(I can use magic in the same way. And it looks like I can set it up like I would a macro? I'll try out some skill combos...)

<blank>

Eventually, the pixies who had been playing the instrument disappeared.

<blank>

“The loud noise from earlier scattered them, but there are still quite a few mobs around.”

<blank>

Looking around, using the radar... using her own search abilities, she checks the location of the Mob.

<blank>

She licks her upper lip with her tongue.

<blank>

“Well, I think I'll give it a try!”

<blank>

She smiles a little confidently and darts off towards the nearest enemy.
