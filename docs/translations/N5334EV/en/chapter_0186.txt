# Episode 174: The Inviter from Above

"Come out!"

<b>

With a creaking sound that echoed like a scream, the rusty iron door opened.

<b>

When the door showed signs of opening, Raria-san and Viola-chan clearly displayed signs of fear.

I whispered, "It's okay," and stepped in front of the door to protect the two.

<b>

<b>

Surprised that I was standing near the door, the man who opened it widened his eyes for a moment.

But he quickly grabbed my upper arm and forcibly pulled me outside.

<b>

The two of them let out small voices upon seeing this, but I sent another reassuring glance to the mother and daughter and slipped through the door as I was pulled.

<b>

<b>

For now, Bibi and Mia should be aware of this place.

I had already sensed their presence at the front of the building while talking to the mother and daughter earlier. The small animal peeking out at that time had been making small sounds, so there was no doubt they noticed it too.

<b>

Additionally, I had given Viola-chan a marker to prepare for unforeseen circumstances, and I had also cast a buff on her.

There’s no way anything would happen to these two.

<b>

<b>

As I stepped out from the door, it turned into a somewhat larger room.

Perhaps it felt even more spacious because the place we had just been in was too cramped.

On either side of the door I came out from, similar iron doors lined up. I could sense that there were others being held captive here.

I was filled with the urge to quickly take down the people in front of me and rescue those others, but I held back.

<b>

Currently, there were five people visible in this underground area. There should have been one more, but it seemed they weren't here right now.

<b>

The guy who brought me out of the room.

The one who is closing the door of the room.

In front of me, there was a staircase leading up, and someone was standing still halfway up, looking up as if waiting for something.

The remaining two were sitting at a table placed in the center of the room.

<b>

They were holding mugs that presumably contained alcohol, and they looked at me with lewd grins as I was brought out of the room.

<b>

"You're looking pretty relaxed, huh? Huh?"

<b>

One of the men sitting at the table called out to me.

He casually poured the contents of the mug he was holding into his mouth, then slammed the mug down onto the table.

Then he stood up unsteadily, swaying as he approached me.

<b>

I recognized this guy.

He was a thug who had chased us as soon as we entered this town yesterday.

It seemed he no longer cared to hide the fact that he was one of the thieves.

<b>

But this guy took a flower pot to the head yesterday, so… is he already okay?

Oh, he does have a bandage wrapped around his head, at least.

<b>

And… 

In a shocking turn of events, this guy is also the pervert who groped my packaged behind!!

<b>

"You’re being kidnapped, so show a little more fear on your face!"

"Hey, be quiet for now."

"Shut up!"

<b>

What’s with this guy? Is he in a bad mood?

I’m the one who’s in a bad mood here.

<b>

"How are the mother and daughter inside? Hehe."

<b>

The thug asked me about the two in the room with a lewd grin.

I replied nonchalantly, "They seemed to be doing very well," and his face immediately twisted in anger.

<b>

"Don’t mess with me! You and those Crunch bastards are definitely underestimating me, you little bastards!!"

<b>

It seems my calm demeanor was not to his liking.

He wanted to see a more frightened face to enjoy while drinking here… what a lowlife! That’s quite disappointing.

<b>

Furthermore, hearing that the mother and daughter inside seemed well must have ignited something within him.

<b>

"Hey, shut up."

"I said shut up, didn’t I?! You bastard! If you want to get hit, I’ll gladly beat you up today too!!"

<b>

The man holding my arm tried to intervene, but this unstable guy was not listening at all.

<b>

But this guy is completely out of line.

The fresh bruises on the two indicate that he was the one who caused them. Did he take his anger out on them yesterday?

It seems he can’t calm down hearing that they’re doing well. Don’t mess with me.

Of course, if he were to hit the two now, it would be his fist that would get hurt due to the buffs they have.

<b>

Still, the anger bubbling up inside me wouldn’t settle.

I thought I was keeping my composure, but it seems I was inadvertently letting anger leak from my eyes.

Noticing my gaze, he froze for a moment, startled.

<b>

But he quickly shook his head as if to brush something off and glared back at me.

<b>

"W-What the hell is that look?! Don’t underestimate me, you bastard!!"

<b>

The thug stepped forward as if to pounce on me.

Is it really okay to move so recklessly while drunk? That’s dangerous, you know?

<b>

As expected, right in front of me, he stumbled and fell over with a loud crash.

Well, that was just a result of me slightly shifting my awareness of action.

<b>

I adjusted my wrist slightly to match his fall.

The handcuffs on my wrist lifted just a few millimeters…

<b>

"Boguh!!"

<b>

At the perfect timing, the edge of the handcuff dug into his nose.

And then, with incredible force, he sprayed blood from his nose and flew to the opposite side in an arc.

<b>

I secretly thought it looked like a tennis manga where someone flies through the air due to the force of their nosebleed!

<b>

"What the hell are you doing?! Are you an idiot?!"

<b>

The man who had been holding my arm shouted at the thug who had fallen.

At the same time, he looked at me suspiciously and muttered, "No way, it couldn’t have been you…?" but when he placed his hand on my handcuffs, he quietly said, "No way…"

<b>

The man quickly moved away from me and checked the condition of the fallen thug.

<b>

"His nose is crushed…! Hey! Carry this guy! You idiot! You’ve made extra work for us!!"

<b>

The other one at the table, being scolded, hurriedly stood up and tried to lift the unconscious thug by putting his hands under his arms.

<b>

"It’s noisy, hey."

<b>

Almost simultaneously, a man’s voice echoed from above the staircase into the underground.

Immediately, I could see the bodies of those in the underground visibly stiffen.

<b>

Coming down was a pale-faced man with terrible dark circles under his eyes, a lanky and creepy-looking guy.

<b>

"Huh? What’s this? What are you doing?"

"Uh, this drunkard fell over…"

"Oh? Just leave that alone."

<b>

The man glanced disinterestedly at the crushed-nose thug, then slowly descended the stairs while shifting his gaze to me.

When he reached right in front of me, he peered into my face with narrowed eyes as if assessing me.

<b>

"Is this the girl in question?"

"I’ve put the cuffs on her as you instructed!"

<b>

I could tell just by looking into his lifeless eyes.

This guy is the type who doesn’t see people as human beings.

He sees humans as mere consumables or something.

It’s a truly unpleasant gaze.

<b>

"You’re quite a composed young lady, huh? You don’t look bad either…"

<b>

As I silently returned his reptilian gaze, he snorted and said that.

On top of that, he even had the audacity to hook his finger under my chin and do a "chin lift"!

<b>

By the way, his fingers are cold. It’s as if I can’t feel any body heat.

Getting fed up, I shook my chin and brushed his finger away.

<b>

"…Hmph, you’re quite strong-willed, huh? I like that, it’s my type."

<b>

I’m not his type!

<b>

Ignoring my irritation, the cold-eyed man began giving orders to the men in the basement. It seemed they were going to put me in a carriage.

Before that, he instructed them to blindfold me here.

<b>

"This is the thieves' hideout, right?"

"…………"

<b>

As a cloth was placed over my face for the blindfold, I decided to ask the man a question.

I made eye contact with the man who had his finger on his chin and slightly opened his eyes.

<b>

"Where exactly are you planning to take me from here?"

"…So you’re aware of various things? Well, that’s fine. Just make sure not to do anything unnecessary, alright? I don’t want to ruin a fine piece like you."

<b>

As my vision was covered by the cloth, I could sense a tone of delight in the man’s voice, which was unpleasant.

<b>

"But, well, if you escape, I’ll have to deal with it accordingly. …Well, I don’t intend to pass such enjoyment onto others."

<b>

A human-like laugh, devoid of humanity, echoed off the cold walls of the underground.

<b>

It seems I’m about to be invited to their main base.

<b>

Yes, I understand.

Until I arrive at the destination I’ve been invited to, I will behave properly.

Yes, yes! That’s the decorum of a lady, after all! Of course, I understand!!
