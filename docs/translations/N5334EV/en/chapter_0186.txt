# 174 Episode The Inviter on the Floor

Get out!"

<blank>

The rusty iron door opens with a creaking sound like a scream.

<blank>

When we felt the door open, Ralia and Viola were clearly showing signs of fright.

I muttered, "It's okay," and stepped in front of the door as if to protect them.

<blank>

<blank>

Perhaps surprised that I was standing so close to the door, the man who opened it looked wide-eyed for a moment.

But he immediately grabs me by the arm and pulls me out the door.

<blank>

I gave the mother and daughter a "don't worry" look again and dove through the door as I was pulled in.

<blank>

<blank>

At any rate, Bibi and Mia should have a good grasp of this location.

When I was talking to the mother and daughter earlier, I knew that they had already noticed the two of them coming to the front of the building. The small animal that was peeking in at that time was also making many small noises, so the two of them definitely noticed them too.

<blank>

And just in case, Viola has been given a marker and buffed in case of any unforeseen circumstances.

These two should not be so treated in any way.

<blank>

<blank>

When I walked out the door, I found myself in a rather large room.

Perhaps it feels even more spacious because the place where I was just now was too small.

On either side of the door I came out of, there is a row of similar iron doors. I can tell by the signs that there are other people being held captive in this place.

I was tempted to quickly take out the people in front of me and rescue them, but I held my ground.

<blank>

There are a total of five people in the basement that I can see right now. There was one other person, but I don't think he is here now.

<blank>

The one who took me out of the room.

The one that closes the door to the room it came out of.

There is an ascending staircase in front of the building, and in the middle of the staircase there is a guy who stops and looks up as if he is waiting for something.

And the other two sat at a table in the center of the room.

<blank>

They were grinning at me as I was led out of the room with a mug of sake in my hand, and they were smiling at me in a disgusting manner.

<blank>

You look pretty comfortable, don't you? Huh?

<blank>

One of the men sitting at the table called out to me.

He poured the contents of the mug he was holding into his mouth and slammed it down on the table.

Then he stood up and approached me, swaying his body.

<blank>

I recognize this guy.

He is a thug who chased us as soon as we entered this town yesterday.

It seems that this guard modo is no longer willing to hide the fact that he is one of the bandits.

<blank>

But this guy must have taken a direct hit from a flowerpot on the head yesterday. ...... is he okay now?

Oh, I do have a bandage on my head, in case you're wondering.

<blank>

And it's .......

Of course, this guy is also the perverted jerk who fondled my bagged hips!

<blank>

They're kidnapping me, so show me some more of that frightened look!"

Oi, don't make a fuss now."

Shut up!"

<blank>

What is this guy? Is he in a bad mood?

We're the ones in a bad mood.

<blank>

"How are the mothers and daughters in the middle? "Hee-hee."

<blank>

The thug grins disgustedly and asks me how the two of us in the room are doing.

I replied, "You looked very healthy," and his face instantly contorted.

<blank>

"You've got to be kidding me! Crunch and his friends are still trying to fuck with me, you fucking pricks!"

<blank>

Apparently, they don't like my nonchalant attitude.

He was drinking at Coco's to see more frightened faces and to have a drink with them. ......

What a lowlife! Well, that was disappointing.

<blank>

On top of that, hearing that the mother and daughter inside also seemed to be in good health seems to have ignited something inside this guy.

<blank>

Hey, shut up.

I told you to shut the fuck up! I'll beat you up again today if you don't want to get beat up enough! If you don't want to get hit enough, I'll hit you again today, as you wish!"

<blank>

The man holding my arm calls out for me to stop him, but this emotionally unstable-looking guy is not listening to me at all.

<blank>

But this guy is totally out of line.

The brand new bruises on their faces were apparently made by this guy. Are you saying that he beat them up yesterday?

He's not happy to hear that they're doing well. Don't be a fool.

Granted, if you hit the two of them now, it will be this guy's fist that gets crushed because it's buffed.

<blank>

Still, it did not stop the resentment that was welling up inside me.

I thought I was maintaining my composure, but it seems that anger was leaking from my eyes.

He noticed my gaze and froze for a moment. He froze for a moment.

<blank>

But he immediately shook his head as if to shake something off and stared back at me.

<blank>

What's that look in your eye? Don't fuck with me, motherfucker!

<blank>

A thug stepped toward us to grab us.

Can you be that careless with your feet when you're drunk? It's dangerous, okay?

<blank>

Sure enough, he came crashing down in front of me.

Well, as a matter of course, this is the result of my shifting my awareness of my actions a bit.

<blank>

I slightly turn my wrist to meet his as he falls down.

The shackles on his wrists are raised just a few millimeters. ......

<blank>

Boguw!!!!"

<blank>

At the perfect moment, the corner of the manacle digs into his nose like a gouge.

The nose blew and popped with great force, and then blew to the other side in a circle.

<blank>

Don't tell me you thought it was like a tennis cartoon flying through the air at the force of a nosebleed!

<blank>

What the hell are you doing? What the fuck are you, a fucking moron?

<blank>

A man who had been holding my arm as I was watching him shouted curses at the thug who had rolled over.

At the same time, he looked at me quizzically and muttered, "Don't tell me you're ......?" He muttered, but as he put his hand on my manacle, he mouthed again in a small voice, "Impossible or .......

<blank>

Immediately, the man moves away from me and checks the condition of the fallen thug.

<blank>

You've got a busted nose. ...... Oi! Bring him in! You idiot! You're making me do more work than I have to!

<blank>

The other person at the table was reprimanded, got out of his seat in a hurry, stuck his hands into the sides of the comatose thug, and tried to pick him up on the spot.

<blank>

You're making a lot of noise.

<blank>

At about the same time, a man's voice echoes through the basement from the top of the stairs.

Immediately, the bodies of those in the basement visibly tensed up.

<blank>

Down came a lanky, thin, ghastly man with a very pale complexion and terrible dark circles under his eyes.

<blank>

What? What the hell is this? What the hell are you doing?"

Yo, this drunken guy just pulled a ......

"Oh? Leave that thing alone."

<blank>

The man took one boring glance at the man with the smashed nose, and then slowly came down the stairs, shifting his gaze to me.

When he came up to me, he looked into my face with narrowed eyes, as if he was trying to decide what to buy.

<blank>

Is this the girl?

I even put on the shackles like you said!"

<blank>

I can see it in its eyes, which have no heat.

This guy is the kind of guy who doesn't even think of people as people.

It's the eye of someone who thinks people are expendable or something.

It's a really nasty eye.

<blank>

'You're a pretty ballsy young lady, aren't you? Not bad to look at either. ......"

<blank>

As I silently looked back into his reptilian eyes, he sniffed and said something like that.

He even put his finger on my chin and did a "chin squeeze" on my chin!

<blank>

By the way, his fingers are cold. It's as if they don't feel body heat.

It was depressing enough, so I shook my chin and paid him off with my finger.

<blank>

"......, you're a strong man, aren't you? That's nice, I like that."

<blank>

I don't like it!

<blank>

The cold-eyed man, who was not concerned about my frustration, gave instructions to the men in the basement. He is going to put me on a carriage.

Before that, he tells me to blindfold myself with Coco.

<blank>

Is this some kind of bandit hideout?

"............"

<blank>

While a cloth was being put over my face to blindfold me, I asked the man for a moment.

His eyes meet with a man who puts his finger on his chin and opens his eyes slightly.

<blank>

Where the hell are you taking me from here?

You mean you're aware of all the ...... stuff? Well, that's okay. I don't want to damage the top of the ball. I don't want to damage the top of the ball."

<blank>

With my vision closed by the cloth, I could read the sound of amusement in the man's voice, along with an unpleasant sensation.

<blank>

'But, well, if you run away, you have to deal with it in a certain way. ......Well, I'm not going to give up that kind of pleasure to anyone."

<blank>

The impersonal laughter, squeezed from the back of his throat, echoes off the cold walls of the basement.

<blank>

They are now going to invite us to their home base.

<blank>

Yes, I know.

I will be properly quiet until I arrive at the place where you have invited me.

Yes, yes! That's what a lady is supposed to do! Of course I understand!
