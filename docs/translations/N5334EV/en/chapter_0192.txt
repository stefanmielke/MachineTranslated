# 180 Annie's Party

That day, Annie woke up earlier than usual.

I was a little late getting into bed last night, but I snapped out of bed and my eyes opened.

Is he still a bit excited?

<blank>

Annie slid out of bed, opened the curtains as she did, and let the morning light that filled the bedroom catch her whole body.

Then he stands a little taller, pours the water from the jug into the basin, and carefully washes his face with the water.

Wiping her face, which was dripping with water, with a soft towel, Annie thought that it was indeed a refreshing morning.

<blank>

It is not surprising that Sari, the maid of honor who came to wake Annie up, was very surprised.

Every day, every morning, Annie usually doesn't wake up after I wake her up once or twice.

On this special day, I came to wake her up a little early, but when I opened the bedroom door, I was greeted in the morning by Annie, who was holding her face with a towel. I couldn't have been surprised.

<blank>

<blank>

Sari's astonishment is understandable, but after all, today is Annie's birthday party, and she is the hostess.

<blank>

I have a role to entertain the many guests who come to the restaurant to the best of my ability.

And since there is even a big event planned at the end of the event, it is only natural that people would be enthusiastic about it.

There was no way I could stay in bed until I was woken up, as I usually do.

<blank>

<blank>

The fact that her brother Will came home yesterday for the first time in a long time was one of the factors that kept Annie excited.

If it were true, I would like to spend the whole day with him on his birthday, but unfortunately, I don't have that kind of time to spare today.

Last night, being able to monopolize Will's lap was satisfying for now.

Therefore, Annie is of the mind that "I'm going to leave Brother Will with Sister Colin for the rest of the day.

<blank>

<blank>

And the twins.

Today will also be the last day I spend with them in this house.

<blank>

Two weeks had already passed since the twins were taken care of by the Cloud family.

He said that the delay in the procedure was longer than expected, but that it is finally in place.

They will be spending the beginning of the week at the temple facility on campus. This will be the last time they will spend time together.

<blank>

For Annie, who already felt that the twins who adored her were like her younger brothers and sisters, the loneliness of being separated from them was greater than she had expected.

But from now on, they will always be in the academy.

With this in mind, I can send them off with a smile as they enter their new lives, rather than the loneliness I feel from being away from my twins.

So I want today to be a memorable day for both of us.

<blank>

<blank>

It was probably the parents who were more damaged by the separation from the twins, as their emotions had been transferred to the twins.

Especially the mother, Liliana, for example, was holding the twins in her arms last night and would not let go of them.

The twins, who had missed her completely, were even more so as they clung to Liliana.

<blank>

Father Philip hugs the three of them together from behind, holding back his tears.

The butlers and maids of honor wept at the sight of this.

<blank>

Siblings Annie and Will, who felt somewhat "left behind," smiled troubled smiles at the picture and exchanged glances with each other.

If Suzy had been there, she must have muttered something like, "What is this chaos?

It was the night before Annie's birthday.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And on this morning, the day of the birthday, people were moving around the Cloud residence in a flurry of activity.

<blank>

At the main residence, Annie's friends arrived before noon, and everyone enjoyed tea, lunch, and entertainment.

<blank>

Then, after the afternoon tea, the adults will begin to gather at the consulate, where the evening session will begin.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The banquet room, which will be the main venue at the Cloud residence, is approximately 10 meters square with beautiful chalk-white painted walls without a single stain.

The delicately decorated folded ceilings were stacked one or two high, making the interior space seem larger and more spacious.

<blank>

The south side of the room also faced the garden, with a series of glass doors that reached the ceiling and occupied the entire side of the room.

It is a structure that allows you to overlook the splendid garden of the Cloud residence while staying indoors.

<blank>

Normally, the deep red velvet curtains that give the room a sense of stateliness are flanked by windows like decorations that enliven a glamorous stage.

But now they have been removed and all the glass doors have been opened, and the stage has been unveiled as an entrance to the garden, as if inviting us into the stage.

<blank>

In the garden, a small orchestra always plays gentle music, and a small stage in the garden is used for small performances.

The guests enjoy the aroma of tea at the table where the tea is set to bloom.

<blank>

<blank>

Annie also remembers to introduce the twins to her classmates' friends whom she invites to the party, saying that they are her younger siblings who will start kindergarten next week.

The friendly twins were immediately accepted by their friends, and Annie was pleased to see that they generally made a good impression.

<blank>

<blank>

It was not only classmates who gathered before noon.

<blank>

All of Amcam's seniors were there, including Colin, whom I adore like a sister.

Carla, Alicia, and Jessica, three girls in their third year of middle school.

And Arrows and Victor, also third-year boys.

<blank>

Victor didn't pause in his visit before turning to Annie's female classmates and, as he should have, kneeling down on the spot, taking their hands in his and dropping sweet nothings in their laps.

Young girls scream at the sweet words brought by the rumored vice president of the student council.

Some of them even lost consciousness.

<blank>

Jessica, the "Iron Clawed Saint," grabs the face of the color demon that plunged the party venue into chaos in an instant and immediately sets about eliminating it.

Then Arrows runs to follow up on the spot. Kara and Alicia following.

This chaos could be described as the usual appearance of a third-year student.

<blank>

Willie, a sophomore, looks on in amazement. Dana is pointing and laughing. Colin and Will are helping Carla and the others to get things back on track.

Irving and Lombardo, the last freshmen to enter, paid no attention to the commotion and, without so much as a hello, headed straight for the corner where the food was lined up, where they began the task of quickly storing it in their own digestive systems.

<blank>

The people of Amkam are indeed a very fast-paced people.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Everyone looks as happy as ever."

<blank>

A young lady with long white-blonde hair carefully pulled back and dressed in a soothing baby blue dress stepped forward to Annie.

<blank>

Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Goldberg.

<blank>

Happy birthday, Annie. I hope you have a wonderful birthday."

<blank>

Thank you.

<blank>

Congratulations, Miss Annie. Thank you for having me today."

<blank>

Another young man with shimmering steeplechase hair, escorting Caroline Goldberg, offers his congratulations to Annie.

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Leinberger.

<blank>

I'm glad you're here, Carrie. And thank you, Mr. Chairman, for coming as well."

<blank>

Colin, spotting them, approaches and thanks Annie from behind for the visit.

<blank>

<blank>

The little ladies were once again colored by the appearance of the student body presidents.

<blank>

At the same time, Kara, Alicia, and the others turn their gazes toward it.

<blank>

-No, it doesn't have to be me, at least not today.

I'll leave it to you guys from my hometown to take care of it, no problem, right?

I brought him here, didn't I? --

<blank>

I can't help but feel the pain in my eyes.

But now it was student body president Anthony Reinberger who decided not to dare look.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm still waiting for the "...... Is Sue still there?"

<blank>

...... Yes, but still, the pigeons arrived earlier in the evening."

<blank>

I hear you've done quite well.

<blank>

Hi! Dear Mr. Leinberger! I hear you've raised a very large bucket!"

<blank>

Oh, my! That's just great, Sue! I wonder what you've accomplished? Did you just clear a village of bandits?

<blank>

I'd like to think ...... that you haven't ............ gone as far as that."

<blank>

In reality, it was nothing more than that, as it blew the mountain down the middle, but Colin, still unaware of this, just hoped that it was nothing serious.

<blank>

<blank>

By the time afternoon tea time arrived, not only Annie's classmates and close friends, but also the children of former nobles and other well-known families in De Kembel arrived, accompanied by their parents.

<blank>

It is not every day that one comes into contact with the Cloud family, a former high ranking noble family. It is unlikely that anyone living in the province of Calais would turn down the invitation. This is especially true for those who were not able to enter Milia Castel Eye.

There are many who would like to take this opportunity to connect face to face with the Cloud family.

<blank>

Some say this is also the result of Philippe's parental stupidity, sending invitations from one end to the other. Mostly from his own people.

<blank>

After congratulating Annie, the parents and their children split into their own groups.

Eventually, they would engage in small talk until the consulate venue was ready, warming their friendship and serving as a stepping stone to building new relationships.

<blank>

<blank>

As the outsiders began to gather, a gentleman with magnificent blonde hair, styled in an all-back, stepped up to Annie.

His quiet appearance seems to reveal his gentle personality.

The gentleman then escorts the two ladies on either side of him. Both are two people Annie knows.

A smile floods Annie's face and she walks over to the three of them to greet them.

<blank>

Happy Birthday Miss Annie. What a wonderful event."

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Casper! Please make yourself at home."

<blank>

Congratulations! Annie! What a wonderful birthday!"

<blank>

Thank you, Miss Cordelia."

<blank>

Happy Birthday, Annie!"

<blank>

Thank you, Miss Karen. That dress looks great on you!"

<blank>

Thank you, Annie."

<blank>

Karen responded to Annie's compliment on her dress with a slightly embarrassed smile.

The dress is a one-shoulder A-line dress. The fabric color is a soothing lilac.

<blank>

The original plan was to use scarlet fabric, but when they realized that the purpose of the dress was to be used for a birthday party, it might stand out more than the guest of honor, they cried and pulled the idea. However, Mrs. Anna and her staff members realized that the purpose of using the dress for the birthday party was to stand out more than the guest of honor, and they had to pull out the idea in tears.

Karen was feeling a lot of pressure, thinking that the outfit was going to be nothing but flashy, but as a result, the fabric was settled on lilac and the flashiness was reduced. Needless to say, she felt relieved and relaxed.

<blank>

However, the fabrics are being made more precisely and luxuriously as planned for the year-end Kirameki Festival, but Karen has no knowledge of this.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"............I knew Sue wasn't ready ......"

<blank>

Karen looks around and notices that Suzy is not there.

<blank>

Yes, Miss Cullen. But I'm told they're on their way."

<blank>

The pigeons informed us that they would be there in time for dinner.

Annie is certainly sad that Suzy is not here right now.

But still, the report of Suzy's big battle on her birthday made Annie feel proud, more than anything else.

<blank>

When Karen and Cordelia were told that Susie would be late, their eyebrows lowered in concern, but they were still quietly relieved to see Annie, who told them that they would be able to have dinner together.

<blank>

They both know that Annie adores Suzy like a worshipper.

I was worried about how much this little friend's heart was hurting because Suzy couldn't come.

However, I could tell by the proud look on Annie's face that it was just a groundless fear.

<blank>

<blank>

One more person approached them.

When Annie noticed this, she turned around to see the other party, whose gray eyes were drooping and kindly narrowed, smiling and congratulating her.

<blank>

Congratulations, Miss Annie. Thank you for having me today."

<blank>

"Dear Mr. Dalton, thank you for coming! Thank you for coming!"

<blank>

Dalton Banjo, who is distantly related to the Cloud family, sends Annie flowers every year on her birthday.

It's been several years since Dalton, who is usually busy, has been able to congratulate her in person in this way. Annie's voice naturally perked up.

<blank>

But Karen's eyes widened when she saw the dolton.

<blank>

You're right on time, Dalton.

Of course. I've been looking forward to this day. You are as always on time, Bona."

<blank>

With that, Dalton Banjo and Bona Raven Casper shake hands and pat each other on the shoulder with big smiles on their faces.

From their appearance, it is clear that the two are old acquaintances and quite close.

<blank>

What?" ...... of the Rose Garden? ...... Oh, did you two know each other?"

<blank>

He, Dalton Banjo, is the president of the Milia Castel Eye boarding school you attend.

<blank>

What's the matter with you? Didn't you know?

Bona asks his two daughters.

Of course, this is the first time I'm hearing about this, so both of them are shaking their heads vigorously and repeatedly with their eyes wide open.

<blank>

We've had a rotten relationship since we were students."

<blank>

The four of us used to hang out together in Milia."

<blank>

"......4 people?"

<blank>

It's me, Dalton here, and Kane and Leela."

<blank>

"! ...... father? ...... mother?"

<blank>

I knew you weren't talking, Dalton. You are as bad as ever."

<blank>

I didn't mean to offend you. I was just trying to find the right time to say it, you know? But you didn't tell me either.

<blank>

It would be too tactless of me to tell you, wouldn't it?"

<blank>

Don't these two look alike? I think Cordilia and Karen exchange a look.

<blank>

I used to visit the Merlins a long time ago.

<blank>

I'm sorry, too! I don't remember a bit of it. ......"

<blank>

Don't be sorry, it's my fault for not telling you. Besides, you were very young. It's understandable that you don't remember.

<blank>

Perhaps that rose garden is ......"

<blank>

......As I said, your eyes are like Leela's."

<blank>

Dalton Banjo, with kindly squinted eyes, spoke to Karen Merlin in a muttered voice.
