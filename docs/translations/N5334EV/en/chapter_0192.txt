# Chapter 180 Annie's Party

On that day, Annie woke up earlier than usual.

Although she had gone to bed a little later than usual the night before, she opened her eyes in bed with a snap.

Perhaps she was a bit excited after all.

<b>

Annie slid out of bed, opened the curtains, and welcomed the morning light that flooded the bedroom with her whole body.

Then, she stretched a little and poured water from the pitcher into the basin, carefully washing her face with it.

As she wiped her dripping face with a soft towel, Annie thought it was indeed a refreshing morning.

<b>

It was no surprise that Sally, the maid who came to wake Annie, was greatly astonished.

Annie usually wouldn't wake up even if she was called once or twice every morning.

Today, being a special day, Sally had come to wake her up a little earlier, but when she opened the bedroom door, she was greeted by Annie, who was pressing a towel to her face. It was only natural for her to be surprised.

<b>

<b>

Sally's astonishment was understandable, but today was Annie's birthday party, and she was the host.

<b>

She had the role of welcoming many guests to the best of her ability.

Moreover, there was a major event planned for the end of the day, so it was only natural for her to be pumped up.

There was no way she could just sink back into bed until she was called like usual.

<b>

<b>

Yesterday, her brother Will returned home after a long time, which was also one of the factors that raised Annie's spirits.

Ideally, she would want him to spend the whole day with her on her birthday, but unfortunately, she didn't have the luxury of time today.

Having monopolized Will's lap last night, she was at least satisfied for now.

So, Annie thought, "For today, I will leave Will to Sister Colin."

<b>

<b>

And then there were the twins.

Today would be their last day together in this house.

<b>

It had been nearly two weeks since the twins started staying with the Cloud family.

It seemed that the procedures had taken longer than expected, but they had finally been sorted out.

Starting next week, the two would be spending their time in the temple facilities within the academy. This would be the last time she would spend with them.

<b>

For Annie, who had already come to feel the twins were like younger siblings, the sadness of parting was unexpectedly great.

But from now on, they would always be within the academy.

Thinking that way, she could send them off to their new life with a smile, rather than feeling sad about being apart.

So today, she wanted it to be a memorable day for the two of them.

<b>

<b>

In fact, it was the parents who were more affected by the parting with the twins, having grown attached to them.

Especially her mother, Liliana, had a hard time letting go of the twins last night.

The twins, who had become quite attached, clung to Liliana even more.

<b>

Their father, Philip, held the three of them from behind, holding back tears.

The butler and maids watching the scene were also moved to tears.

<b>

Feeling a sense of "being left behind," Annie and her brother Will exchanged troubled smiles as they looked at the scene.

If Suzy had been there, she would have surely muttered, "What is this chaos?"

That was the night before Annie's birthday.

<b>

<b>

<b>

And now, on the morning of her birthday, the Cloud residence was bustling with people moving about.

<b>

At the main residence, Annie's friends began arriving around noon, enjoying tea and lunch together while participating in various festivities.

<b>

Then, around the time afternoon tea was over, the adults began gathering at the consulate, where the evening events were set to begin.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The banquet room, which would serve as the main venue at the Cloud residence, was about 10 meters square, a beautifully painted room with pristine white walls.

The intricately decorated coffered ceiling, with its layered design, made the indoor space feel even larger and more expansive.

<b>

Additionally, the south side of the room faced the garden, with several glass doors reaching up to the ceiling, occupying the entire side.

This design allowed for a splendid view of the Cloud residence's magnificent garden from inside.

<b>

Normally, heavy crimson velvet curtains would adorn the windows, enhancing the festive atmosphere.

But now, those had been removed, and all the glass doors were opened, inviting guests into the garden.

<b>

In the garden, a small orchestra played gentle music, and a modest performance was held on a small stage within the grounds.

Guests enjoyed the aroma of tea at tables arranged like blooming flowers.

<b>

<b>

Annie did not forget to introduce the twins to her classmates as "my younger siblings who will be entering kindergarten next week."

The friendly twins were quickly accepted by her friends, and Annie seemed satisfied with their generally positive impression.

<b>

<b>

The classmates who gathered before noon were not only her classmates.

<b>

Colin, whom she adored like a sister, and seniors from Amcam were all present.

Karla, Alicia, and Jessica, a trio of third-year girls from the middle school.

And also, the third-year boys, Arrows and Victor.

<b>

As soon as Victor arrived, he approached Annie's female classmates, naturally kneeling and taking their hands, showering them with sweet words.

The young girls screamed at the sweet words delivered by the rumored vice president of the student council.

Some even fainted from the excitement.

<b>

The "Iron Claw Saint" Jessica swiftly grabbed the face of the color demon who had turned the party venue into chaos and immediately began to expel him.

Arrows rushed in to help, followed by Karla and Alicia.

This chaos was just another typical scene for the third years.

<b>

Willy, a second-year student, watched the scene with a look of disbelief. Dana pointed and laughed, while Colin helped Karla and the others restore order.

Finally, first-year students Irvin and Lombard entered, ignoring the commotion and heading straight to the food area to begin their rapid consumption.

<b>

They were truly laid-back Amcam residents.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Everyone seems to be having fun as usual."

<b>

A young lady with long white-blonde hair neatly styled and dressed in a calming baby blue dress stepped forward to Annie.

<b>

"Thank you for coming today, Miss Goldberg."

<b>

"Happy birthday, Annie. It looks like it's going to be a wonderful celebration."

<b>

"I appreciate it."

<b>

"Congratulations, Miss Annie. Thank you for inviting us today."

<b>

And another young man, whose dark hair swayed as he escorted Caroline Goldberg, offered his congratulations to Annie.

<b>

"Thank you, Mr. Reinberger."

<b>

"I'm glad you came, Carrie. Thank you for coming, President."

<b>

Colin approached the two upon spotting them, thanking them for their visit from behind Annie.

<b>

<b>

With the arrival of the student council president, the little ladies became excited once again.

<b>

At the same time, the gazes of Karla, Alicia, and the others turned toward them.

<b>

--No, isn't it fine if it's not me today?

Isn't it fine to leave the cleanup to you guys from the same hometown?

You brought them here, right?--

<b>

The gaze was painfully intense.

However, the student council president, Anthony Reinberger, decided to deliberately ignore it for now.

<b>

<b>

"…Oh? Is Suzy still not here?"

<b>

"…Yes, but I just received word that she will arrive by tonight."

<b>

"She seems to have been quite active."

<b>

"Yes! Mr. Reinberger! I've heard she achieved quite a significant result!"

<b>

"Wow! As expected of Suzy! What kind of achievement did she make?! Did she flatten the bandit settlement?!"

<b>

"I hope she didn't go that far... I want to believe she didn't..."

<b>

In reality, she was blowing up mountains from the middle, so it was far from that, but Colin, who still didn't know, could only pray that it hadn't escalated into a major incident.

<b>

<b>

By the time afternoon tea was served, not only Annie's classmates and close friends but also former nobles residing in Dekkenberg and children from notable families arrived with their parents.

<b>

Connections with the old upper-class Cloud family were not easily obtained. Those living in Kalais would hardly decline such an invitation. Especially for those who couldn't enroll in Milia Castle Eye.

Many wanted to take this opportunity to connect with the Cloud family.

<b>

This was also a result of Philip's doting parent power manifesting, sending out invitations left and right. Mainly from family members.

<b>

After exchanging congratulatory words with Annie, these families split into their respective groups.

Until the preparations for the consulate venue were complete, they would engage in small talk, strengthen friendships, and lay the groundwork for new relationships.

<b>

<b>

As outsiders began to gather, a gentleman with beautifully styled blonde hair approached Annie.

His calm demeanor suggested a gentle personality.

And this gentleman was escorting two young ladies on either side, both of whom Annie recognized.

Annie couldn't help but smile and walked over to greet the three.

<b>

"Happy birthday, Miss Annie. This is a wonderful event."

<b>

"Thank you, Mr. Caspar! Please enjoy yourselves."

<b>

"Congratulations! Annie! It's a lovely birthday!"

<b>

"Thank you, Miss Cordelia."

<b>

"Happy birthday, Annie-chan."

<b>

"Thank you, Miss Karen. That dress suits you!"

<b>

"Thank you, Annie-chan."

<b>

Karen, praised by Annie for her dress, responded with a slightly embarrassed smile.

The dress was a one-shoulder A-line dress in a calming lilac color.

<b>

Originally, it was supposed to be made of scarlet fabric, but realizing that the purpose of this dress was for a birthday invitation, it might overshadow the guest of honor, Lady Anna and the staff reluctantly scrapped that idea.

Karen, who had felt immense pressure thinking it would turn out to be a flashy outfit, ended up with the fabric in lilac, which subdued the flashiness. It goes without saying that she felt relieved and relaxed.

<b>

However, it was being crafted more elaborately and luxuriously with the originally planned fabric for the upcoming Night Ball of the Glimmering Festival at the end of the year, a fact that Karen was completely unaware of.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…So, Suzy-chan is still not here, huh…"

<b>

Looking around, Karen noticed Suzy was absent.

<b>

"Yes, Miss Karen. However, I heard she is on her way."

<b>

The pigeon had conveyed that she would "make it in time for dinner."

Annie indeed felt a sense of loneliness at Suzy's absence.

But still, the report that Suzy had achieved great results on her birthday made Annie feel prouder than anything.

<b>

Hearing that Suzy would be late, Karen and Cordelia furrowed their brows with concern, but seeing Annie calmly say, "It seems we can have dinner together," they quietly sighed in relief.

<b>

The two knew how much Annie adored Suzy.

They were worried about how much their little friend was hurting because Suzy couldn't come.

However, upon seeing Annie's proud face, they understood that it was just an unnecessary worry.

<b>

As they were chatting, another person approached them.

Noticing this, Annie turned around to see the person with gentle gray eyes smiling and offering words of congratulations.

<b>

"Congratulations, Miss Annie. Thank you for inviting us today."

<b>

"Mr. Dalton! Thank you for coming!"

<b>

Dalton Banjo, who was distantly related to the Cloud family, had been sending Annie bouquets every year on her birthday.

It had been several years since Dalton had personally come to celebrate her birthday. Annie's voice naturally brightened.

<b>

However, Karen's eyes widened upon seeing Dalton.

<b>

"You made it here on time, Dalton."

"Of course. I've been looking forward to this day. By the way, Bona, you're still punctual as ever."

<b>

They shook hands, beaming smiles as they patted each other's shoulders, revealing that Dalton Banjo and Bona Raven Caspar were old friends and quite close.

<b>

"Huh? …The Rose Garden? …You two knew each other?"

<b>

"He's Dalton Banjo, the chairman of the Milia Castle Eye boarding school you attend."

<b>

What are you talking about? Didn't you know?

Bona asked the two daughters.

Of course, it was the first time they heard this, so both widened their eyes and vigorously shook their heads.

<b>

"We've been close since our student days."

<b>

"We often hung out together in Milia."

<b>

"…Four of us?"

<b>

"Myself, this Dalton, and then Kane and Leela."

<b>

"！…Father? …Mother?"

<b>

"I see you haven't told them, Dalton? You're still as mischievous as ever."

<b>

"I didn't mean to. I was just waiting for the right moment to bring it up. But you haven't mentioned it either."

<b>

"It would be quite rude for me to say it myself, wouldn't it?"

<b>

Cordelia and Karen exchanged glances, thinking that these two seemed similar.

<b>

"Long ago, I often visited the Merlin family."

<b>

"I'm so sorry! I don't remember at all…"

<b>

"Don't apologize. It's my fault for keeping quiet. Besides, you were quite young. It's understandable that you don't remember."

<b>

"Could it be that the Rose Garden is…"

<b>

"…Indeed, your eyes resemble Leela's."

<b>

Dalton Banjo, with his gentle eyes, murmured to Karen Merlin.
