# 54 - The Council of Amkham

So you're saying everything is fine at this point?

<blank>

August Dulles asked back in a low voice.

<blank>

Yes, we have three teams, including an A-grade team, immediately after receiving a report from "Team Aria. Yesterday, I sent three teams, including an A-grade team, to patrol the area, but so far, there have been no reports of any abnormalities with regard to magical beasts. I think there is a lull in the overflow."

<blank>

Listening to the report of the staff member with the documents in his hand, August, sitting at his office desk, wrinkles between his eyebrows deepened.

<blank>

I'm sorry for your head, but it's a good thing she was in the middle of her ordeal this time..."

No, this is not the only time.... She has taken care of me many times.

<blank>

Silence Croquis interrupted August's words, which he uttered while relaxing.

<blank>

Beatrice's father, Silence, is the current patriarch of the Kroki family, who will turn 48 this year.

She has amber eyes and a large forehead, much like her daughter's, and slightly quirky, fly-colored hair that is cut short.

The sharpness of his eyes, which peek out from the depths of his eyes, suggests that he has a deep insight.

<blank>

Now Silence was sitting on a sofa in the office of the village head of Amcam House, listening to the reports from the staff with August.

<blank>

August looks from the staffer standing in front of his desk in the Oval Office to Silence, who is relaxing on the sofa diagonally in front of him.

<blank>

Yes, you're absolutely right. We owe her a debt we cannot repay..."

"Borrowed... or maybe she doesn't think so..."

<blank>

Silence took the cup on the table, sipped the tea, and muttered to herself.

<blank>

But even if it is," he said. We must reward her. We will not make the same mistake as the village of old.

<blank>

August clasped his hands together as he stood on his desk, and in a quiet tone of voice, he told Silence emphatically.

Silence sipped from his cup and muttered, "Of course.　I'm sure of it," he muttered to himself.

<blank>

So, what happened to our 'princess' ceremony?"

Yes, I just received word that it was completed without incident.

<blank>

August's question was answered by a staff member who checked the documents in his hand.

<blank>

Well, the ......... meeting starts at 10:00, but I'm sure the Goshen and Alphonse will be here shortly."

"Yeah? It's still early, isn't it, just after eight o'clock?"

The daughter of the head of the head of the family is a boast, and Alphonse is not the only one! Naturally, the spear is pointed at us, too. I can just see his face, itching to catch us and make us listen!"

<blank>

August and Silence are conversing as they look at the large longcase clock mounted on the wall in front of their desks.

A large, finely carved clock with a beautifully crafted, filled-in surface glowed a golden color, and the pendulum ticking away the hours beneath it played a rhythm that resembled a gentle heartbeat.

<blank>

I wish you would know the extent to which you are being foolish with your parents.

'...... Silence... you say that? You know the extent of your parental stupidity...? You?"

I said, "...... what? Did I say something funny?"

No, it's nothing, don't worry about it."

<blank>

August and the staff, who had been looking at Silence with indescribable expressions on their faces, quietly put their cups to their mouths and sipped their tea, looked at each other yukily and then let out a sigh of resignation.

<blank>

In the quietness of the office, the only sound was a heavy and precise verse, echoing in the shimmering air.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Let's see, ...... Anna...Mary...is it?"

<blank>

What's that? I think I've heard that one before.

I recited your name as if I was asking you....

<blank>

'My name is AnnaMarie, Miss. Please call me AnnaMarie."

Ah...eh? Huh?"

<blank>

It came back without a pause! I took a step back!

<blank>

AnnaMarie! Miss."

<blank>

Once again, he repeated it by bringing his face close to mine with a zwick!

It's important, isn't it? So important that you have to repeat it? AnnaMary!

That's your name, isn't it? It's important, isn't it?

<blank>

She used to be a housemaid at Amukam House. She helped you dress for the harvest festival...don't you remember?"

<blank>

Sonia Mom's words.........

Yes, I remember, I remember these finch glasses on my nose.

She was one of the maids who helped me with the corset and dressing for the dress with great care that time!

Come to think of it, did they introduce themselves to you then, too?

<blank>

I remembered! I wonder if I made a face that said... AnnaMarie looked at me and nodded, smiling once again.

<blank>

"Oh, well, thank you... for your help... ......"

<blank>

When I tried to bow my head, AnnaMarie just turned her palm toward me and said, "Wait....

<blank>

No need to worry, miss. That is our job. Besides, we will be taking care of your daughter every day from now on!

<blank>

He said emphatically.

What? Every day? What? What are you talking about? This guy!　I turned to Sonia-mama and asked her with my eyes.

<blank>

AnnaMarie is here to be your maid of honor. We will be together every day from now on, so please be good friends.

<blank>

He said with a wonderful smile on his face.

<blank>

Huh? Jijo?

What is it that Mama Sonia is talking about? A lady-in-waiting is a person who is attached to a nobleman or a good young lady, right? A lady-in-waiting is a person who accompanies a nobleman or a good young lady, right? I can understand that in Bibi's family, but a maid of honor for me? No way...no way.... I can understand if it was the Cloud family when there was a noble system.... But they are not nobles now, you know? It's a normal family. It's not suitable for my stature! I am not worthy of it!

May I? I am a commoner, you know? I'm a commoner, you know? I'd be an embarrassing and silly girl if someone else saw me like this. Why are you my maid of honor?

<blank>

I don't know what it means!

<blank>

You know what, Susie? You don't have to think so hard, okay?"

<blank>

As my head was spinning and my eyeballs were whirling with this unexpected event, Sonia-mama called out to me, "Well, well, well. Oh, my God!

<blank>

You know that Elrose used to be in a position of responsibility at Amcom House, right?"

I was a housekeeper, I think. I believe you were a housekeeper, and..."

Yes, that was more than 10 years ago. So, sometimes maids from Amcome House are sent to Elrose for training. We often accept them and help them with their maid training. This time it was AnnaMarie.

<blank>

So AnnaMarie is coming to our house for training for a while?

<blank>

I'm here to train to be a maid of honor! AnnaMarie is here to train to become a maid of honor! So while you're at it, you might as well learn some manners and behavior! Yes! And while we're at it, we're at it!

<blank>

That's right!　And with a clap of her hands on her chest, Sonia Mama was able to continue her story.

<blank>

So, Susie has to serve AnnaMarie as her maid of honor! Otherwise, she won't get any training! Do you understand? Susie!

<blank>

Even with those words from Sonia-mama, I was still perplexed...

<blank>

"...and, you know, this is something that Howard and I have been talking about for a while..."

<blank>

With that, he approached me and continued his story.

<blank>

I'm sure you already know this, but we often have to deal with other people. I was hoping Susie would remember how to behave in such situations.

<blank>

Mama Sonia took another step forward and continued talking while holding my hand.

<blank>

Of course, I know you don't like that kind of thing. If you really don't like it, you don't even have to show up! We'd like to help you as much as we can, though.

<blank>

Saying this, she took my hand in hers and brought it to her own breast.

<blank>

I'm sure Elrose and I could teach her the manners, but I thought it would be easier for Susie to learn from her older sister, who is closer to her in age. After all, AnnaMarie has a perfect knowledge of manners.

<blank>

When Mama Sonia said this, AnnaMarie smiled and said, "Leave it to me!　She nodded.

I could only reply with ah...yes....

<blank>

Come on, come on! Let's not stay here forever, let's go inside! Suzy, go take a bath, clean yourself up, and get dressed. AnnaMary, please?"

Yes, ma'am. "Yes, ma'am! Miss, let's go!"

<blank>

AnnaMarie puts her hand around my waist and holds my hand as if she were escorting me to a dance, and takes me inside the house.

<blank>

'Let us polish you up well! Miss!"

What?" Polishing? ...Huh? Oh, bath? A, AnnaMarie...?"

AnnaMarie,! Miss. Don't worry. I'll make sure every inch of your room is spotless, okay?

<blank>

So AnnaMarie brought her mouth close to my ear and whispered softly in a small voice.

<blank>

What? That...? Yeah! I'm all alone... hey... hey!

<blank>

While I was in a panic, AnnaMarie happily dragged me to the bathroom.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The Amkam House, or the former residence of the Count of Amkam Frontier, is one of the most majestic buildings in the country, known as the "Palace of the North.

The structure is composed of two wings extending squarely from the main building of the palace toward the gate, and a courtyard surrounded by square walls. The courtyard is surrounded by a square wall.

Its exterior was formed by a pattern of hammered stone walls, and the unevenness of the stone with repeated steps gave the entire building a powerful presence.

The outer tower, which extends one level outward at the four corners of the walls surrounding the main house, is seen by some to resemble a beast sitting on all four legs. The roof is high and steeply pitched, with a slate hipped roof.

Its lacquered roof, bathed in sunlight, added a quiet glow to the heavy building, giving it an even greater presence in the northern lands.

<blank>

A room at the far end of the palace in such a stately building.

It is called the "inner room" by those who serve in the castle, and is the largest meeting room in the Amcam House, the "Amcam Council Meeting Room".

<blank>

Council Chambers.

It is the center of the AMCAM Protectorate, which is composed of the 12 AMCAM teams, and only members of the council are allowed to enter.

<blank>

The room on the third floor of the main house, facing north, has several large windows that offer a panoramic view of the mountains of Deipala.

<blank>

The walls of the room were over 10 meters on each side, and a large board was mounted on the south wall, opposite the window, on which small wooden bills were placed in neat rows.

It is the name tag of the Amkam Protectorate and its members.

<blank>

Unlike the nameplate hangers found in dojos in Japan, these were made of a piece of wood that was inserted horizontally.

Several wooden tags are lined up vertically, and furthermore, they extend to the left and right like a belt.

That's three tiers. The top, middle and bottom, filled the walls.

<blank>

Those housed in the lower section are from 1st to 3rd ed.

The middle row is from 4th to 7th.

The upper rows are from the 8th to the 10th, and these are the original ones that were called the upper and middle ranks.

Today, another new bill also fits in that last row.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A huge mantelpiece is set into the east wall of the room.

Above it hung a portrait, finely crafted in gold and framed in a thick, luxurious frame. It was as if the person depicted in the portrait was looking around the entire room.

The man in the portrait, with his white beard and regal bearing, looked somewhat like Howard Cloud.

<blank>

Facing the front of the portrait, there was a man looking sharply at the front of the portrait. It was Howard Cloud himself.

The chair Howard sits in is a massive mahogany one.

The back of the chair was straight and high, and the magnificence of the ornamentation on it indicated that it belonged to the master of the room.

<blank>

Now Howard was slumped in his chair, resting his cheekbones on the table with his lightly gripped left hand, quietly watching the meeting progress.

<blank>

<blank>

And? Who's the grader headed for confirmation?"

It's Rhea, the late Ramzin's son."

<blank>

Harry, the patriarch of the Haggard family, who is considered the best warrior in Amkham, is over two meters tall.

August Dulles answered the question that Harry Haggard had posed to him as he walked around his huge frame.

<blank>

Harry, who is also Ryder and Irvin's father, has the same sometimes golden umber Wolf Eyes and dark blonde hair as they both have.

This is also a characteristic of the Haggard family, and Bert, the eldest son, who is not in the village now, has the same thing.

<blank>

Harry had his long hair brushed back in an all-back style and had a look worthy of being called "The Lion".

<blank>

"As the eldest son of the Campbell family, what could possibly go wrong?"

<blank>

And when Silence Croquis asked Harry to agree, he nodded silently.

<blank>

So you're saying there's a lull in the 'overflow'?"

I don't know yet, I'm just saying things are calmer now."

<blank>

Richard, the Matisun family patriarch, asked for confirmation.

To which August shakes his head and replies, "You never know.

<blank>

Richard, Mia Mathieson's father, is a thin man, if only in appearance, with the same ultramarine eyes, gently wavy natural brown hair, and mustache as his daughter.

But with his two names, "The Annihilator of the Blue Clouds" and the class of Akashic Lord, he is also one of the most powerful firepower in Amkam.

<blank>

'I assume the other villages continue to call for assistance?'

The village of Ouadh is particularly hard hit. Bram, the village chief, came to me and said the mine was unusable."

<blank>

Frank Long then asks Silence.

<blank>

I heard that Kobolds are springing up in the mountains. There are so many of them that they don't have enough to deal with..."

Every village is like that. They all want the same number of hands."

We don't have enough to do.

<blank>

August adds to Silence's explanation, and Alphonse Beers informs him of the current situation.

Hearing this, Gary Meyers folded his arms and made a reluctant face.

<blank>

Still, we have to make the necessary arrangements. What of the forces that remain now? August.

As you can see, nearly half of the Group 12 patriarchs are out of the office. Inevitably, less than half of them have a grade.

<blank>

August responded to Howard's question by looking at the nameplate on the wall.

<blank>

There are only seven patriarchs of the 12 families here now.

At the round table in the conference room, August, the chairman, was seated in front of Howard, Silence was on his right, and Alphonse was on his left.

<blank>

Half of the nameplates hanging on the wall in the upper section are white, and one-third of those in the middle section are also white.

<blank>

Those who stay in the village are inscribed with their names in black on the front and white on the back, while those who are out of the village and not present are displayed on the wall as white tags.

<blank>

I guess I was a little premature in allowing the rider to leave..."

I'm not going to let him go. Harry, I'm going to ask Wuerd to go with you. We need at least five teams, and let me know when you've selected them. At least five teams, and let us know when you've selected them.

<blank>

Harry rubbed his chin in thought as he looked at the nameplate hanging in front of him, but nodded his head in agreement to Augusto's words.

<blank>

What about the other villages? If you want, I can come with you."

Alphonse. This is not a matter that can be done in a few days' trip. You three patriarchs cannot be away from Amkam for an extended period of time, can you?"

That's what I mean, Alphonse. I appreciate the offer, but I'm not going to do it this time. So, Gary will go to Marvel, Frank to Argosy, and Richard to Wand. That leaves us three families as the only twelve remaining in Amkam.

<blank>

Howard stopped Alphonse's suggestion. As it was, August told him of the village where the remaining three were headed and showed him with a cowering shoulder that Amkam had only three families remaining.

<blank>

With the three of you, do you have any concerns about our strength?"

<blank>

Harry said, amused.

<blank>

Well, we'll take care of the village, and you can go off and do whatever you want."

<blank>

The silence also sent a wry smile to Harry, who was lifting the corners of his mouth.

<blank>

Don't be a psycho! Don't encourage Harry. What if he shuts down the mine itself?"

<blank>

August's words... "You're going to go that far?　When Silence looks at Harry, Harry cries, "I don't know," and evades answering.

<blank>

In any case, other villages are still 'overflowing. We don't know how long this lull will last. Just be prepared for the long haul.

Under the circumstances, the arrival of the Knights next month...I still don't think we have the manpower."

The grade-holders will be sent away, but there are enough 10th team members to go around. There should be no problem in selecting the Knights' companions from among them."

<blank>

August looked around at the people in the room and announced his intentions.

However, Gary expressed concern about the number of people who would accompany him on the Knights' search for Irosio the following month, but Silence nodded his head in assent.

<blank>

I'm glad you're here at this time.

I'm telling you, if it weren't for her, we wouldn't have a village to protect.

<blank>

Harry propped both elbows on the table and rested his chin on the back of his hand, muttering to himself as he looked at the brand new wooden plaque that had just been added to the last row today.

In response, Richard also turned his eyes to the wall and followed Harry to award the owner of that tag.

<blank>

So?" How did it go? Alphonse. How were the trials of our 'princess'?"

Hmm...? Hmm... that. You have performed your duties in an orderly and honorable manner..."

<blank>

Frank asks about today's ritual, but Alphonse's reply is nowhere near as crisp.

<blank>

"...? Really? That's the best of all worlds, isn't it? ...more importantly, during the ordeal, you defeated numerous magical beasts, and you also took out the Red Pongo almost single-handedly, right?"

Oh, yes, and I've had the wreckage collected by Rhea and the others inspected."

<blank>

When I asked him further about his story during the ordeal with some doubt, Alphonse answered that it was still a brilliant performance. Frank and Richard congratulated Howard.

<blank>

No, it's really a great achievement! Congratulations again, Your Highness.

Congratulations, Your Highness.

Mm-hmm! Thanks, Frank! Richard! My daughter...Susie is very happy with the results. They even had time to prepare a souvenir.

I'm not sure! A souvenir? That's a lot of leeway! What did you get?"

<blank>

Unexpectedly, Gary was interested in what Howard said, and what is it?　He asked.

At that moment, Howard's eyes lit up.

Alphonse, August, and Silence all reacted to this, but Gary was completely oblivious.

<blank>

"Huh. ......, here it is."

Is this... a sculpture?"

Oh, it's a sculpture. This is a sculpture of an eagle. He made it as a consolation for the time he spends in the tent..." "Even if it's a consolation... it's really well made. Even if it's just for comfort...it's really well done. Don't you think so?

It's very rough...I'd say bold..."

I suppose it is! They say it's good to have the cut left by the knife. That's what makes it taste so good! They made an eagle's nose out of these horns.

I see... now that you mention it... it does look that way..."

I know it is so! I know you did! He said it was difficult to express the majestic beard under his nose! It's well done, isn't it? Isn't it? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

August had a light sense of déjà vu as he watched Howard hit the back of Gary's voice saying, "Yes, sir.

At the same time, this will continue for a while.... With a deep sigh, I felt a sense of resignation.

Alphonse and Silence are also looking at Gary with pitying eyes.

Ah, the morning is here again," he said.

<blank>

Gary's back, which is making a loud bang-bang sound, is also shaking a little louder.　August rubs his aching back and gets up from his seat to stop Howard.

<blank>

The council chambers still echoed with Howard's high-pitched laughter.



<blank>

----------------

"Well, I often get presents from my daughter..."

'Well, Silence. Tell me another time."

Well, don't be shy, Alphonse. We'll get you out of there."

'So you don't have to take out your breast pocketbook. You don't have to open it, Silence!"

There, look. Here's one from last year. Isn't it beautiful?"

So I know the pressed flowers are there. No need to be coy about it, Silence."

And this one is from the year before that. Look, it still has a nice color."

Hey, Harry! Look at me! Don't look away!

This is the tenth year that he has made me a wreath for my birthday. Every year she says, 'I'll make you another one next year,' and it's already been 10 years. Isn't she a very healthy and good girl who never makes good on her promises? Alphonse."

Oh, yes, you're right, Silence. That's a good boy indeed. Hey, Frank! Frank! Why did you move one seat away from me? So turn around!

'She makes all the wreaths into pressed flowers before they die. She's really a sweet girl.... Look, this one is five years old, but this one has different petals from the others, you see?"

Oh, I can see that you and your head are of the same race! Hey Richard! You're a stranger, aren't you? So don't look away!

And this was ...... six years ago."

...... somebody... stop this guy."
