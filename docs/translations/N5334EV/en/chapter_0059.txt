# Chapter 54: The Amukam Council

"Then, does that mean there are no issues at this point?"

<b>

August Dales asked in a low voice.

<b>

"Yes, we received a report from 'Team Aria' immediately, and three teams, including an A-grade team, have been dispatched for patrol since yesterday. Currently, there have been no reports of abnormal occurrences of magical beasts. The 'overflow' seems to be in a state of calm."

<b>

Listening to the report from the staff member holding the documents, August, sitting at his desk, deepened the furrow in his brow.

<b>

"I apologize to the head, but it was fortunate that she was undergoing her trial this time..."

"No, this isn't just about this time... That girl has helped us many times."

<b>

As August spoke with a relaxed tone, Silence Croki interjected.

<b>

Silence, the father of Beatrice, is the current head of the Croki family, which is 48 years old this year.

He has amber eyes similar to his daughter, a large forehead, and slightly wavy, short, light-colored hair.

The sharp gaze peering from his deep-set eyes hinted at a profound insight.

<b>

Currently, Silence was seated on the sofa in the village chief's office of Amukam House, listening to the report from the staff along with August.

<b>

August shifted his gaze from the staff member standing in front of the desk to Silence, who was relaxing on the sofa diagonally in front of him.

<b>

"Indeed, that's absolutely correct. We owe her an unpayable debt..."

"Debt... well, she probably doesn't think of it that way..."

<b>

Silence held the cup placed on the table and sipped his tea, muttering as if to himself.

<b>

"Even so, we must repay her. We will not tread the same path as the former village."

<b>

August firmly told Silence in a quiet tone while clasping his hands together on the desk.

Silence, with his lips to his cup, murmured quietly, “Of course.”

<b>

"So, how did our 'princess's' ceremony go?"

"Yes, I just received word that it has been completed without any issues."

<b>

In response to August's inquiry, the staff member checked the documents at hand and answered.

<b>

"I see... The meeting is at 10 o'clock, but it seems the head and Alphonse will arrive soon."

"Huh? Isn't it still early? It's just past 8 o'clock."

"The head won't be satisfied with just Alphonse bragging about his daughter! Naturally, the spear will be directed this way too. I can almost see the head's face itching to catch us and talk!"

<b>

August and Silence exchanged words while looking at the large long-case clock mounted on the wall opposite the desk.

The large clock, adorned with intricate carvings, shone with a beautiful dial filled with exquisite craftsmanship, and the pendulum ticking below played a rhythm reminiscent of a gentle heartbeat.

<b>

"Honestly... I wish the head would understand the limits of his doting."

"… Silence… are you the one to say that? To know the limits of doting… you?"

"… What? Did I say something funny?"

"… No, it's nothing, don't mind it."

<b>

As Silence quietly brought the cup to his lips and took a sip of tea, August and the staff exchanged looks with an indescribable expression before letting out a sigh of resignation.

<b>

In the quiet office, only the heavy and precise ticking of the clock echoed through the still air.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Um... Anna... Mary, is it?"

<b>

Huh? I feel like I've heard that name before...

I repeated the name as if to ask...

<b>

"It's Anna Mary, my lady. Please call me Anna Mary."

"Oh... eh? What?"

<b>

The response came back immediately! I instinctively took a step back!

<b>

"It's Anna Mary! My lady!"

<b>

Once again, she leaned in closer and repeated it!

It's an important thing, isn't it? It's important, so she repeats it, right? Anna Mary-san!!

Of course, it's her name! It's important, isn't it?!

<b>

"This girl has been a housemaid at Amukam House until now. Remember, she helped you with your dressing during the harvest festival... don't you recall?"

<b>

At Sonia Mama's words, I exclaimed, "Ah!"

That's right, I remembered; I recognize the Finch glasses perched on my nose.

That was one of the maids who helped me with the corset for wearing the dress and was very meticulous in assisting with my dressing!

Now that I think about it, she introduced herself back then too, didn't she?

<b>

Did I have a face that said I remembered? Anna Mary-san looked at my face and smiled again, nodding.

<b>

"Ah, um, thank you for your help back then..."

<b>

As I tried to bow my head, Anna Mary-san raised her palm towards me as if to say wait...

<b>

"My lady, there's no need for such courtesy. That is our job. Besides, more than anything, I will be taking care of you every day from now on!"

<b>

She said firmly.

Huh? Every day? Huh? What is this person saying? I turned to Sonia Mama with questioning eyes.

<b>

"Anna Mary was called here to be your maid. You'll be together every day, so please get along, okay?"

<b>

She said with a wonderfully bright smile.

<b>

Huh?! A maid?! 

What is Sonia Mama saying? A maid is someone who attends to nobles or well-off young ladies, right? I can understand it if it's Bibi's house, but a maid for me? No way... it's impossible... I could understand it if it were during the time of the noble system in the Cloud family... but now there are no nobles? It's an ordinary household! This is beyond my means! 

Do you understand? I am a commoner! To others, this would make me a ridiculously ignorant and embarrassing daughter! Why would I have a maid?!

<b>

I don't get it!

<b>

"Hey, Suzy? You don't have to think so hard about it, okay?"

<b>

As my mind twisted around this unexpected event, my eyes spinning, Sonia Mama said in a soothing tone.

<b>

"You know that Elrose used to hold a responsible position at Amukam House, right?"

"… Ah, yes. I believe she was a housekeeper..."

"Yes, that was over ten years ago... And because of that, sometimes maids from Amukam House are sent to Elrose for training. We often accept such girls and help them with their maid training. This time, it was this girl, Anna Mary."

<b>

"Eh... So Anna Mary-san will be coming here for training for a while?"

<b>

"… Yes, training... Yes, training! Anna Mary came for training to become a maid! So it would be good for you to learn etiquette and manners along the way! Yes! Just along the way!"

<b>

That's right! Sonia Mama clapped her hands at her chest and continued speaking.

<b>

"So, Suzy, you have to let Anna Mary serve you properly as a maid! Otherwise, it won't be training, you know?! Do you understand, Suzy?"

<b>

Even with Sonia Mama's words, I was still bewildered...

<b>

"… And you know, this is something I had discussed with Howard from before..."

<b>

Sonia Mama said as she approached me and continued speaking.

<b>

"You probably understand, but we have many occasions where we need to socialize with others. If possible, I wanted you to remember the etiquette for such times."

<b>

Sonia Mama stepped forward, holding my hand as she continued to speak.

<b>

"Of course, I know you find such things difficult. If you truly dislike it, you don't have to show your face at those places! ... But, we want to do as much as we can for you."

<b>

As she said this, Sonia Mama brought my hand to her chest.

<b>

"While I can teach you etiquette, I thought it would be easier for you to learn from an older sister close to your age. After all, Anna Mary has perfect knowledge of manners."

<b>

When Sonia Mama said this, Anna Mary-san nodded with a smile, saying, "Leave it to me!"

I could only respond with a simple, "Ah... yes..."

<b>

"Now, now! Don't stay here forever, let's go inside! Suzy, go wash up in the bath and change. Anna Mary, please take care of her!"

"Understood, madam. Now, my lady, let us go!"

<b>

Anna Mary-san wrapped her hand around my waist as if escorting me to a dance, leading me into the house.

<b>

"I will make sure to polish you up properly! My lady!"

"Eh? Polish? ... Huh? The bath? A-Anna Mary-san... will do it?"

"Anna Mary, my lady. ... Please don't worry. I will thoroughly... meticulously... polish you, okay?"

<b>

Anna Mary-san leaned close to my ear and whispered softly.

<b>

"Eh? W-what?! No! I-I can do it myself... wait a moment!"

<b>

While I was flustered, Anna Mary-san happily dragged me towards the bathroom.

<b>

Amukam House, formerly the residence of the Amukam Baron, is one of the most magnificent buildings in the country, known as the "Northern Palace."

Its structure features two wings extending in a square shape, cradling the main building as it leads towards the gate. It is evident that it is an evolved form of fortress architecture, surrounded by square walls enclosing a courtyard.

The exterior is formed by a pattern of stone walls, with the unevenness of the stone creating a strong presence throughout the building.

At the corners of the walls surrounding the main building, outer towers expand outward, resembling a beast sitting on four legs. The roof is high, with a steeply pitched gable covered in slate.

The lacquered roof, bathed in sunlight, adds a quiet brilliance to the heavy building, enhancing its presence even more in the northern land.

<b>

In one room located at the innermost part of this heavy structure.

This is the largest conference room in Amukam House, known as the "Amukam Council Chamber," referred to by those working in the castle as the "Inner Room."

<b>

"Council Chamber"

It is a place composed of the 12 teams of Amukam, where only council members are permitted to enter, essentially the core of the Amukam Guard.

<b>

Located on the third floor of the main building facing north, the room has several large windows, allowing a panoramic view of the mountains of Daypara from within.

<b>

The walls of the room exceed 10 meters on each side, and on the south wall opposite the windows, a large board is mounted, neatly displaying small wooden nameplates.

These are the nameplates of the members of the Amukam Guard.

<b>

Unlike the nameplate racks seen in Japanese dojos, the wooden pieces are inserted horizontally.

The horizontal wooden plates are arranged vertically, extending left and right like a belt.

There are three tiers: upper, middle, and lower, filling the wall.

<b>

The lower tier contains members from 1st to 3rd.

The middle tier contains members from 4th to 7th.

The upper tier contains members from 8th to 10th, which is the basis for the upper and middle ranks.

Today, a new plate will be added to that last row.

<b>

<b>

<b>

On the east wall of the room, there is a massive mantelpiece.

Above it hangs a portrait framed in a thick, luxurious frame adorned with intricate gold detailing. It seems as if the person depicted in the painting is surveying the entire room.

The figure in the portrait, with a white beard and a dignified demeanor, bore a resemblance to Howard Cloud.

<b>

Facing forward, with a sharp gaze, stood a man also looking straight ahead. It was Howard Cloud himself.

Howard sat in a heavy mahogany chair.

The backrest was straight and high, and the exquisite decorations indicated that this chair belonged to the master of the room.

<b>

At this moment, Howard was seated in that chair, lightly resting his left hand on the table, watching the progress of the meeting quietly.

<b>

<b>

"So, who was the grade holder sent for confirmation?"

"It was Raia, the son of Ramjin."

<b>

Harry Haggard, the head of the Haggard family, known as the finest warrior of Amukam, stood over 2 meters tall.

In response to Harry's question, August Dales answered.

<b>

Harry, the father of Ryder and Irvin, has golden amber wolf eyes that occasionally shine and dark blonde hair.

This is a characteristic of the Haggard family, and even their eldest son, Bart, who is not in the village, possesses the same traits.

<b>

Harry styled his long hair back and had a visage befitting the title of "Lion."

<b>

"If it's the eldest son of the Campbell family, there shouldn't be any issues, right?"

<b>

Silence Croki sought Harry's agreement, and he nodded silently.

<b>

"Then the 'overflow' is in a state of calm?"

"Not yet clear; it is only calm 'for now.'"

<b>

Richard, the head of the Mattison family, asked for confirmation.

In response, August shook his head, indicating that they should not let their guard down.

<b>

Richard, the father of Mia Mattison, has ultramarine eyes and naturally wavy brown hair with a mustache, appearing somewhat slender.

However, his moniker, "The Ultramarine Annihilator," and his class as an Akashic Road holder make him one of the highest firepower members of Amukam.

<b>

"Requests for support from other villages are still ongoing, right?"

"Ward Village is particularly severe. The village chief, Bram, said the mines are unusable."

<b>

Frank Long continued to question Silence.

<b>

"It seems there are kobolds swarming the mountains. Apparently, there are too many of them, and they can't keep up..."

"Other villages are in similar situations. They all need more manpower."

"We also lack manpower on our side."

<b>

August supplemented Silence's explanation, and Alphonse Beas conveyed the current situation.

Hearing this, Gary Mayers crossed his arms, making a grim face.

<b>

"Still, we must take action. What about the remaining forces? August?"

"Yes, nearly half of the heads of the 12 teams are out, as you can see. Consequently, the number of grade holders is also less than half."

<b>

In response to Howard's question, August shifted his gaze to the nameplates on the wall.

<b>

Currently, only seven heads of the 12 families are present.

At the round table in the conference room, August, the chairperson, sat directly across from Howard, with Silence on his right and Alphonse on his left, representing the three main families. On Howard's left, Gary and Frank sat on the south side, while Harry and Richard occupied the north side.

<b>

The nameplates hanging on the wall also showed that half of the upper tier and a third of the middle tier were white plates.

<b>

The nameplates are black on the front and white on the back, with names engraved on them. Those staying in the village have black plates, while those who are away from the village have white plates displayed on the wall.

<b>

"Perhaps it was a bit premature to allow Ryder to depart..."

"What's done is done. Harry, you will go to Ward. They need manpower, at least five teams. Let us know once you select them."

<b>

Harry, who had been pondering while stroking his chin and looking at the nameplates, nodded in response to August's words.

<b>

"What about the other villages? If necessary, I can go as well."

"Alphonse. This is not a matter that can be resolved in a few days. The heads of the three families cannot leave Amukam for an extended period."

"That's right, Alphonse. Your offer is appreciated, but we will refrain this time. So, Gary will go to Malvel, Frank to Argosh, and Richard to Wand. That leaves only the three families remaining in Amukam."

<b>

Howard halted Alphonse's suggestion. August then stated the villages the remaining three would head to, shrugging to indicate that only the three families remained in Amukam.

<b>

"With the three of you here, is there any concern about the remaining forces?"

<b>

Harry said with a hint of amusement.

<b>

"Well, leave the village matters to us, and you three can go have your fun."

<b>

Harry, with a smirk, received a similarly defiant smile from Silence.

<b>

"Silence, stop! Don't provoke Harry. What if he ends up destroying the mine itself?"

<b>

As August spoke, Silence shot a glance at Harry, asking, "Would you really do that?" Harry shrugged and evaded the question.

<b>

"In any case, the other villages are still experiencing the 'overflow.' We don't know how long this calm will last. Be prepared for a long-term battle."

"With this situation, the knight brigade will arrive next month... we are indeed short on manpower."

"While the grade holders will be out, there are still enough 10th teams. There should be no problem selecting companions from them for the knight brigade."

<b>

August surveyed the room, announcing his intentions.

However, Gary expressed concern about the personnel accompanying the knight brigade arriving next month, but Silence's words made him nod, indicating that he was somewhat reassured.

<b>

"Truly, I am grateful that the young lady is here with us at this time."

"Indeed, without her, we wouldn't be able to protect the village."

<b>

Harry leaned on the table with both elbows, resting his chin on his hands while gazing at the brand-new wooden nameplate added to the last row today.

In response, Richard also turned his gaze to the wall, following Harry's lead in honoring the owner of that plate.

<b>

"So, how did it go? Alphonse. How did our 'princess's' trial go?"

"Um...? Yes... she completed it splendidly without any issues..."

<b>

When Frank inquired about today's ceremony, Alphonse's response was somewhat hesitant.

<b>

"…? Is that so? That's good to hear... But more importantly, during the trial, she defeated many magical beasts and almost single-handedly took care of the Red Pongo, right?"

"Ah, yes, I had the chance to examine the remains collected by Raia and the others."

<b>

Feeling some doubts, I further inquired about the trial, and Alphonse's answer confirmed her remarkable performance. Frank and Richard offered their congratulations to Howard.

<b>

"Indeed, it is truly impressive! Head, congratulations once again!"

"Congratulations, Head."

"Yes, yes! Thank you, Frank! Richard! My daughter... Suzy is also satisfied with the outcome this time. It seems she even had the luxury to prepare a souvenir."

"Really? A souvenir? That sounds like quite a luxury! What kind of thing is it?"

<b>

At Howard's words, Gary couldn't help but show interest, asking what it was.

At that moment, Howard's eyes sparkled.

Alphonse, August, and Silence reacted slightly, but Gary was completely oblivious to it.

<b>

"Hehe... here it is."

"This is... a sculpture?"

"Ah, yes, it's a sculpture. Apparently, it's a depiction of me. They made it as a pastime while spending time in the tent... Even as a pastime, it's remarkably well done. Don't you think so?"

"Y-yes, indeed... it's quite rough... or rather, bold..."

"Isn't it! They say the knife marks left on it are what give it character! They used the corner here to create my nose; do you think it resembles me?"

"R-really? Now that you mention it... it does look somewhat like you..."

"That's right! That's right! They said it was difficult to express the dignified beard under my nose! It's well done, isn't it! Hahaha!"

<b>

As Gary said, "Indeed," Howard continued to pat him on the back, and August felt a slight sense of déjà vu.

At the same time, he felt a deep sigh of resignation, thinking this would continue for a while.

Alphonse and Silence looked at Gary with pitying eyes.

Ah, the morning has returned, he thought.

<b>

The loud sounds of Gary's back being patted grew gradually larger. August thought he should stop soon, or Gary's departure would be delayed, and he stood up to stop Howard.

<b>

The laughter of Howard still echoed throughout the council chamber.

<b>

----------------

"Hmm, I often receive gifts from my daughter as well..."

"Is that so, Silence? Tell me about it next time."

"Well, don't hold back, Alphonse. I can show you right away."

"There's no need to pull out the notebook from your chest. You don't have to open it, Silence!"

"Look here, this is from last year... Isn't it quite beautiful?"

"Yes, I know the pressed flowers are there. There's no need to go out of your way to show it, Silence."

"And this is from the year before that. Look, it still has a nice color."

"Hey, Harry! Look over here! Don't look away!!"

"It has been ten years since she started making flower crowns for my birthday... Every year she says, 'I'll make one for you next year,' and yet it's been ten years. I think she's a really good girl who keeps her promises, don't you, Alphonse?"

"Ah, yes, that's true, Silence. She's truly a good child. Hey! Frank! Why did you move one seat away? Look this way!"

"She presses all the flower crowns before they wilt. She's really a kind girl... Look, this one is from five years ago, but this one has petals that are different from the others; can you tell?"

"Ah, it's clear that both you and the head are of the same kind! Hey, Richard! Are you an outsider? Don't look away!!"

"And this one is from six years ago..."

"… Someone… stop this guy."

<b>

Next time: "The Maid of the Cloud Family"
