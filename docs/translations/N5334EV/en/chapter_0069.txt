# Episode 64: The Sanctuary of Amukamu

It was a small hill with a grassy area of about 30 meters square.

<b>

Located about 5 kilometers from the entrance of the forest, it was already said to be in the mid-layer region.

However, no magical beasts intruded upon this hill.

It was the only safe zone in the Amukamu forest.

<b>

On the way here, there had been a fair number of magical beast attacks.

However, within the knight order, there was no one who lagged behind against magical beasts in this area.

It could be said that they had smoothly completed the first day's journey.

<b>

“Oh! Is this the famous ‘Hero’s Hill’?”

<b>

As soon as the leader of the third squad, Tony Easton, stepped onto the hill, he exclaimed with overwhelming emotion.

His face was filled with joy, a look that truly resembled that of a boy in front of his admired hero.

<b>

The story of the hero was a fairy tale that the people of this country had heard many times since childhood.

Tony Easton was no exception to this. He had spent his boyhood dreaming of the hero’s tale.

<b>

Perhaps most of those belonging to the knight order shared the same excitement for the hero’s story as he did. Everyone’s eyes sparkled in unison.

<b>

“This isn’t a place with such a grand name.”

<b>

Then, a gruff voice called out from behind Tony.

<b>

Startled by the sudden voice, Tony turned around to find a large man carrying a massive battle axe.

The man, with a carrot-orange beard mixed with gray hair, was quietly surveying the surroundings of the hill while stroking his beard with his left hand.

His leather breastplate pushed up, and the muscular body carrying the battle axe was certainly not that of a man approaching seventy.

Everyone present could feel the overwhelming aura of a powerful warrior emanating from him.

<b>

Standing there was Conrad Blouk, the former head of the Blouk family, one of the twelve squads of Amukamu.

<b>

Overwhelmed by Conrad’s presence, Tony momentarily forgot to breathe and swallowed hard.

<b>

“Ah... no, but! This is the place where the hero once manifested...”

<b>

“It’s not such a grand place!”

<b>

Even so, Tony wanted to convey that many knew the name of this place, and that many, including himself, held a longing for it.

He wanted to express that he was not belittling this place in any way.

However, he could not continue his words as Conrad’s tone grew stronger, cutting him off.

<b>

“Stop it, Conrad.”

<b>

Howard placed a hand on Conrad’s shoulder.

Conrad clicked his tongue and averted his gaze, then spoke to no one in particular.

<b>

“This place is... nothing more than a spot where a single girl wished to return home and see her family. It’s just a place where such a thing happened a long time ago. Don’t call it by such a grand name.”

<b>

With that, Conrad left the spot and went over to where Gilberto had dropped his heavy load.

<b>

“I’m sorry, Lord Meyer. Please don’t mind it.”

“No! I too failed to consider everyone’s feelings... I apologize.”

<b>

Howard and Cedric Meyer were apologizing to each other for their family’s rudeness.

<b>

“Just understand, Lord Meyer. This place holds deep significance for the people of Amukamu. Some may feel a bit resistant to letting outsiders use it.”

“Even so, I cannot help but feel gratitude for being allowed to use it. I will use it with all due respect!”

<b>

Howard’s face brightened at Meyer’s formal words.

<b>

“That said, don’t hesitate to use it as a regular campsite. Conrad, despite his appearance, is fundamentally just a soft-hearted guy. He’s probably feeling awkward right now. I’ll have him help set up the camp later.”

“Yes, thank you, Lord Cloud.”

<b>

Meyer smiled in agreement with Howard, who wished to give Conrad a chance to dispel any bad impressions.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“W-What a place... What kind of place is this?!”

<b>

Connor Clark muttered, his face pale.

<b>

The journey from the royal capital to Amukamu had been comfortable along the well-maintained roads.

Even so, he had experienced a fair share of encounters with magical beasts in the wilderness.

<b>

For Clark, who had only known life in the royal capital, the first magical beast he saw was pure terror.

A mountain dog with red eyes. A beast resembling a monkey that attacked with a shriek. A boar as big as a calf.

He had also encountered a group of goblins.

<b>

There was no doubt that if ordinary humans like them encountered even a single magical beast, they would surely lose their lives.

<b>

However, the members of the knight order had been defeating such terrifying opponents one after another, just one or two at a time.

Watching this, Clark thought that the knight order was indeed the strongest. He felt special to be protected by such individuals, satisfying his self-esteem while also assuring himself of the safety of this journey.

<b>

But what about since coming to this forest?

It had only been half a day, but what was with the abnormality of this forest? It was clearly different from the paths they had traveled before.

<b>

The knights were not struggling, but the frequency and number of magical beasts appearing were different.

How many magical beasts had attacked in just this half day?

<b>

On this journey through the forest, there were no carriages to protect them.

What was that giant scorpion? He had never seen such a large gray wolf! And that giant snake with two heads!

If even one of those got past the knight order’s encirclement... just imagining it made cold sweat run down his back.

<b>

This was a magical realm that far exceeded his imagination.

In just half a day, Clark began to regret embarking on this journey.

<b>

“...Sir Clark, could you please confirm this area?”

<b>

As Clark bit his lip, two subordinates brought along as his aides called out to him.

They held a cylindrical object with a crystal ball attached and magical seals engraved on it.

This was a magical tool that could record images by flowing a small amount of magical power into it.

<b>

“What?! You do it yourselves! Don’t bother me with this!!”

“No, I’m sorry... but without your approval, Sir Clark, we cannot save the records...”

<b>

Taking records of the expedition was the reason they were accompanying the knight order.

They could not neglect their original job.

<b>

“Tch! Fine! Hand it over!!”

<b>

Clark clicked his tongue in annoyance and roughly snatched the recording device from the staff’s hands.

He began to read the device’s records, but the contents did not register in his mind.

His thoughts were solely focused on how to survive the next few days and return safely.

As he looked at the images of the magical beasts flowing from the recording device, Connor Clark’s survival instincts screamed.

If it came to that, he would have to survive even if it meant using them as shields. The most important thing was his life! He was tormented by a sense of urgency, peering at the two staff members with bloodshot eyes.

<b>

In just half a day, merely passing through the Amukamu forest, Connor Clark’s mind began to fray.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“Uhyohyo! How delightful, how delightful! Truly delightful!”

“Nosori, you seem to be having quite a good time. Did something good happen?”

“What are you saying? Morris? We’re in such a wonderful place! Have you gone senile?!”

“Idiot! I’m not senile! You’re just getting all worked up over the magical beasts pouring in one after another!”

“Absolutely! This place is incredible!”

<b>

“What’s going on? You two seem to be having quite a ruckus.”

“Oh! Isn’t that the assistant of Seiwashi? Please do something! Nosori is being too loud!”

“Ah, what’s happened? Nosori-sensei?”

<b>

“What have you seen up to this point? This is a treasure trove of magical beasts born from magical power that has turned into miasma! In the shallow parts of the forest, there are still some magical beasts that are just ordinary creatures transformed by miasma, but as you go deeper, it’s likely to be all generated beings! To see magical beings born from magical power so closely and in such large numbers is something that could never happen in the royal capital! How can one not be excited?!”

“Ah, I see. But please calm down, Nosori-sensei. Your blood pressure is going to be a problem.”

<b>

“Hm? What’s wrong, Joseline?”

“Oh, Seiwashi-sensei! Nosori-sensei is in trouble!”

“Hm, I understand why Nosori is excited.”

“Is that so?”

“Hm, the amount of magical power in this area and its flow is extraordinary.”

“Hmm! Seiwashi is getting excited too?!”

“Hm, it’s as if magical power from all over the world is gathering here. The deeper you go, the denser the magical power becomes. The eddies created in such a flow of magical power must be considerable. It’s only natural that powerful magical beasts would emerge in such a place.”

<b>

“Ah, Seiwashi-sensei, you’re getting a bit excited too.”

“Isn’t it? But Seiwashi, is it really safe for ordinary humans in such a dense magical power area?”

“Hm, those bureaucrats, right? Well, in this area, they should still be fine. However, if we go 4-5 thousand meters deeper, it won’t be so easy for those who aren’t adept at handling magical power like us or the knight order.”

“Eh?! That’s quite serious! Those people will be crushed by the magical pressure!”

“Hm, Joseline, you really have a way of making things sound less tense. Well, either way, it shouldn’t be a problem. With the anti-magic gear I provided, they should be able to endure it.”

“Ah, that cape was it, right?”

“I see! Then that’s a relief!”

“Hm, well, it should last for another 30-40 kilometers! Even we would be lucky to last up to around 50 kilometers without any countermeasures.”

<b>

“I see, that’s quite serious! But... right now, I’m more interested in the structures beneath my feet!”

“Hm, you mean the underground structures that Henry told us about in the village? They are indeed intriguing.”

“What are they made of? Where did they mine and transport them from, and how were they processed?”

“Hm, the magical density in this area is thin and the flow is quite gentle. It wouldn’t be strange to think there’s a causal relationship with the underground structures. Hm, it’s definitely worth investigating.”

“Isn’t it? Can we investigate? Can we dig it up?”

“Please stop, both of you! If you do that, you’ll cause trouble for the villagers!”

<b>

“Hm, I see. It wouldn’t be fair to Henry, who told us about it.”

“Hmm, Henry, indeed. He was the one researching this place. We can’t just dig it up without permission.”

“That’s right! Besides, you two knew the head priest and everyone, didn’t you?”

“Hm, didn’t you know? Joseline? Henry used to teach at the university.”

“That was ten years ago, so the assistant probably doesn’t know.”

“Wow, is that so? That’s the first I’ve heard of it!”

<b>

“He was still as serious as ever.”

“Whoa! Nosori, you’re alive?!”

“I’m alive, you know! Don’t go killing people off, Morris!”

“I thought for sure your blood vessels had burst, but it seems you’re safe.”

“Safe? What do you mean by that?!”

“Nosori-sensei! Nosori-sensei! You really look like you’re about to burst a blood vessel, so please calm down!”

“Hm, Joseline, you really lack a sense of tension. Hm, about Henry, though. I thought he might have loosened up a bit since he got married, but it seems he hasn’t changed at all.”

“Uhyohyo! After all, he ended up with one of his students!”

“Eh?! Is that so? That serious-looking guy was after a student?!”

“Well, it seems she was a bit of a homewrecker. She chased after Henry when he left for the village and ended up staying.”

“Wow, either way, that’s unexpected. Ah, everyone! It seems the tents have been set up. Please move your belongings quickly. Come on, let’s move!”

“Hmm, you don’t need to push! Seiwashi! Your assistant is still as inconsiderate as ever, isn’t he?!”

“Hm, Joseline doesn’t have any respect for us, so it can’t be helped.”

“Yes, please walk quickly!”

“It’s truly lamentable. Whoa! I can walk without being pulled!”

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

That evening, I received an invitation from Cameron Fourier, the representative of the delegation.

Well, it’s practically “again”...

<b>

Today is the 4th of the second month. It has already been six days since Howard and the others set out.

<b>

My “exploration” can recognize up to about a 10-kilometer radius.

From Amukamu House to the edge of the forest is roughly 4 kilometers.

From there, it was another 5 kilometers to the “Hill of Lamentation” where Howard and the others camped on the first day.

<b>

The next day, as soon as we left the “Hill of Lamentation,” I was already out of my exploration range.

I even went as far as the front of the first outpost to check, but the next day I was out of my exploration range again.

<b>

I considered sneaking into the forest multiple times to confirm things.

But if I used “Invincible,” I felt Anna Mary would notice.

Of course, even if Anna Mary noticed, I thought she would keep quiet...

<b>

I even thought about sneaking deep into the forest, erasing my presence, and swiftly eliminating any magical beasts that might harm Howard and the others.

However, I couldn’t bring myself to do that, as it felt like it would hurt Howard’s pride.

<b>

Understanding the concept of “a man’s dignity” made it difficult for me to either stop or assist Howard.

On the contrary, I wanted him to stay home, not caring about such things.

The desire for him to be by Sonia Mama’s side was strong, creating a fierce dilemma within me.

<b>

Even so, I believe that fully equipped Howard could easily defeat magical beasts even at a depth of about 50 kilometers in the forest.

The magical beasts at the 50-kilometer mark had a threat level of around 100.

Against such an opponent, both Howard and Conrad would have no worries in a one-on-one fight.

However, it would be quite tough for the members of the knight order.

Thus, Howard’s view was that they wouldn’t venture that deep on this exploration...

<b>

So there shouldn’t be any need for concern... there shouldn’t be.

<b>

Even though there shouldn’t be, both Sonia Mama and I felt a knot in our chests since we heard about this.

That knot, of course, still exists and seems to be growing little by little.

<b>

It had already been nearly a week since the investigation team entered the forest, so it would be reasonable to expect some form of communication, but the absence of any news only amplified this feeling.

Tomorrow marks exactly one week!

If there’s no news by tomorrow, I intend to charge into the forest tomorrow night! I swear!

<b>

<b>

And the invitation from Mr. Cameron Fourier only further aggravated my troubled mind.

<b>

Mr. Fourier’s invitations were not new; they had been ongoing since the very first dinner on the day the investigation team departed.

<b>

The first night was fine as I was with the families of the Dulles and Kuroki families.

After that, it became just Sonia Mama and me having to entertain him.

Sonia Mama had been trying to politely decline every night, but he insisted on having dinner with just the two of us.

Though Sonia Mama had refused his requests, he had been quite persistent.

So, I accepted this as my role as the daughter of Lord Cloud, the host of Amukamu.

Sonia Mama was worried, though...

<b>

Moreover, this old man had already noticed that I was his target!

And it was becoming increasingly obvious!!

His gaze towards me was blatant, indeed!

<b>

For the first time as a woman, I realized how persistent a man’s gaze could be!

I could clearly feel the stares directed at my open neckline, back, waist, and the line of my hips and butt!

Even when pretending not to look, I could feel his gaze crawling over me!

Ugh! I wanted to punch the old me in the temple and say, “You idiot!”

<b>

Well, even so, I’m not so generous as to show off just because I know Mr. Fourier is watching!

I only wore a dress that revealed my chest and back during the welcome banquet.

After that, I’ve only worn outfits that are fully closed up.

I’m not a cheap woman who would expose my bare skin for free!! Hmph!

<b>

Even so, it’s quite intimidating how he tries to peek through my clothes!

I had forgotten about a man’s imaginative gaze! Ugh, it gives me the creeps!

<b>

Seriously! At his age, to look at a 14-year-old girl with such lewd eyes... what a terrible lolicon!

How could he feel lust for such a child?!

<b>

...Huh? Huh? What? That’s strange. I feel like I just got hit with a major boomerang... but it must be my imagination! Yes! No problem! I’m the one involved! Yes! I’m fine!!

<b>

<b>

So, dining with Mr. Fourier, who has ulterior motives and is transparent about his intentions, is nothing short of a trial.

His conversation starts with his own bragging, then moves on to life in the royal capital, how well-maintained the city is, and how beautiful and grand the buildings are.

The people living there are very stylish, all wearing the latest fashions...

And so on, it’s nothing but a stream of praises from Mr. Fourier.

<b>

“How about it? Are you interested in the royal capital?”

“...Well, yes, I can tell from your stories that it’s a wonderful city.”

“Indeed! If Princess Suzy would like, I would be happy to guide you anytime. Or better yet, why not study abroad in the royal capital? I would spare no expense to assist you for the princess’s sake! I can prepare a mansion for you right away!”

“No, I truly appreciate your feelings, but I plan to attend the Dekkenbell school next year.”

“...I see, the Millia Castle Eye boarding school? That boarding school indeed has a prestigious sister school in the royal capital... However! I must say, it is not fitting for a princess to be languishing in such a rural area!”

“...Is it really a rural area?”

“Indeed! In the royal capital, your talents can surely flourish! The glamorous royal capital is where you truly belong!!”

<b>

It seems this gentleman is trying to entice me to the royal capital.

He keeps explaining how wonderful the royal capital is and how much of a backwater Amukamu is.

<b>

To be honest, I couldn’t care less about the royal capital.

I’m already feeling heavy about going to Dekkenbell, and there’s no way I could go even further to the royal capital!!

I can’t even think about being away from Sonia Mama and Howard Papa for an extended period!!

<b>

It seems this man has no idea of my inner feelings.

He relentlessly pushes the royal capital on me.

<b>

...This is bad, I’m getting more and more irritated.

This guy not only praises the royal capital but also begins to belittle Amukamu as a backwater.

<b>

“Furthermore, I must say, your father, Lord Cloud, is getting on in years. If possible, wouldn’t it be filial piety to show the refined princess’s appearance in the royal capital as soon as possible?”

<b>

Ah, I’m seriously pissed off now.

<b>

This pig just referred to Howard Papa as an old man with a short lifespan!

Has he not seen that dignified and spirited figure? This bastard...

Should I just tear off that unnecessarily large nose of his...?

<b>

...Wait, no, no. I need to calm down. I’m reflecting on this.

Anna Mary, who is accompanying me, also has an unsettling look in her eyes.

<b>

This is dangerous; I should withdraw quickly.

So, I decided to cut the conversation short and bid farewell to Mr. Fourier.

<b>

Honestly, dining with Mr. Fourier is exhausting!!

He forces his own stories on me without regard for my feelings, just like a shady circle or a religious recruitment tactic!

...Wait! Does that mean that unless I firmly refuse, this will continue indefinitely?

Ugh, please stop...

<b>

As I thought about this and felt like I might implode, I decided to take a moment to calm down by having tea in our family’s living room.

<b>

Upon entering the living room, I found Sonia Mama already sitting on the sofa.

She seemed to be embroidering something, holding a hoop in her hands.

<b>

When she noticed me entering, Sonia Mama stopped her embroidery, patted the seat beside her, and smiled gently, inviting me to sit next to her.

<b>

I quickly moved to sit beside Sonia Mama, bypassing the table.

Then, I sat down next to her, leaning against her.

<b>

“Are you okay, Suzy...? Did you have an unpleasant experience?”

“Yes, I’m fine, Sonia Mama. There’s nothing wrong.”

<b>

Sonia Mama placed her hand gently over mine, looking worried as she asked.

When I assured her that I was fine, Sonia Mama turned her gaze to Anna Mary.

<b>

“Leave it to me, madam. If necessary, I will handle it swiftly at any time.”

<b>

In a tone as if she were discussing the processing of a hunted prey, Anna Mary answered calmly.

So please stop! No need for such ominous things!!

<b>

Sonia Mama smiled a troubled smile at Anna Mary, then turned her gaze back to me and said, “Shall we take a breather?” and asked Elrose to prepare some tea.

<b>

<b>

The living room we were in was located between my room and the bedroom of Sonia Mama and Howard Papa.

Of course, being the living room of Amukamu House, it was many times larger than the one at home!

It was as big as a classroom.

<b>

The mantelpiece was also incredibly large and luxurious.

It was probably twice the size of what we had at home.

The sofa and table we were sitting on were chic yet splendid.

The frames were crafted with gentle curves, and the reliefs of intertwining plants were intricately and meticulously carved, showcasing the craftsmanship.

The red velvet-covered sofa was plush, and it felt too luxurious for a commoner like me.

<b>

Ah, I wish I could relax in my home’s living room soon...

<b>

<b>

“Howard used to hardly ever stay calm in the village...”

<b>

Sonia Mama began to speak quietly as she placed the teacup on the saucer in her hand.

<b>

The conversation was about Howard Papa.

Both Sonia Mama and I didn’t particularly care about Mr. Fourier, so our feelings quickly shifted away from him.

What we were truly concerned about was Howard Papa. It had already been a week. Both of us couldn’t help but think about him.

<b>

I leaned against Sonia Mama’s side, looking up at her as I waited for her to continue.

<b>

“He often left the village for requests from elsewhere, but most of the time, it was to challenge the depths of the forest... He had been saying since childhood that it was his mission to develop Iroshio.”

<b>

Sonia Mama spoke with a slightly amused tone, her gaze falling into the teacup as if she were finding past memories in the tea surface.

<b>

“This time it’s only been a week, but there were times when he wouldn’t be in contact for a month or two... There were even times when he didn’t return from Iroshio for half a year. Each time, he never once considered how worried I was, you know? He would always say, ‘Sonia, I’m back,’ and hug me with a happy smile. I would always respond, ‘Welcome back, Howard. Aren’t you tired?’ Because I didn’t want to show him how worried I was, I always tried to respond as coldly as possible.”

<b>

I found it quite fresh and adorable to hear Sonia Mama speak in a slightly sulky tone.

I could vividly imagine the exchanges between Howard Papa and Sonia Mama at that time.

<b>

“Since Lavie was born, Howard has been home more often. Then, when Lavie turned five, he declared his retirement and chose to leave the front lines...”

<b>

With that, Sonia Mama turned her gaze to a photo frame placed on the mantelpiece.

<b>

Yes, there are photos in this world too. Though they are in black and white.

They look much blurrier than those in the original world. They resemble the photos of old samurai, with still-primitive technology.

<b>

Now, several photos that Sonia Mama brought from home were placed on the mantelpiece in this living room.

There were individual photos of me, Sonia Mama, and Howard Papa. A family photo of the three of us. A young photo of Howard Papa. A young photo of Sonia Mama. And... a photo of Lavie.

Sonia Mama said she had kept Lavie’s photo tucked away for years without displaying it. She mentioned that she hadn’t been able to look at it properly for years.

After taking the family photo, she wanted to place it alongside Lavie’s photo, so she took it out from the back of the desk and placed it next to my photo.

I remember being so happy when Sonia Mama said that now our family could be together.

<b>

Now, while gazing at Lavie’s photo, Sonia Mama continued her story.

<b>

“After that, it seems he found fulfillment in nurturing the next generation... But still, the feelings he had since childhood are not something that can be easily erased... When he said he was going to Iroshio, the same light was in his eyes as back then. The truth is... I didn’t want him to go to Iroshio. I wanted to stop him... But when I saw those eyes, I couldn’t stop him at all. After all, he is... Howard is a man of Amukamu, and I am a woman of Amukamu. That will never change, no matter how far we go...”

<b>

Setting the teapot on the table, Sonia Mama gently stroked my head as if to comfort me.

I took both of Sonia Mama’s hands in mine and leaned closer.

<b>

“But it’s okay... It’s okay. Howard always comes back without any issues. This time will be the same... He will come back with a smile saying, ‘I’m back,’ just like always. So... it’s okay.”

<b>

Sonia Mama repeatedly told me, “It’s okay.”

<b>

As if she were trying to reassure herself, she kept saying it over and over...

I silently looked up at Sonia Mama, holding her hands tightly.

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

On the 5th of the second month, at 4:05 AM

In the pre-dawn darkness, the mobile heavy cavalry unit stationed at the “Hill of Lamentation” was suddenly engulfed in chaos.

<b>

Among the backup units from the 7th to the 10th squads, the 9th and 10th squads were on standby in Amukamu village.

Currently, a total of 20 members, including 10 from the 7th and 8th squads and 10 from the logistics unit, were stationed at the “Hill of Lamentation,” waiting for communication from the front lines and preparing for supplies.

<b>

Now, a knight on a black horse came rushing in from the depths of the forest with tremendous speed.

He trampled over the hastily erected barricades, knocked down the bonfire, and the horse collapsed on the spot, foaming at the mouth.

The rider was bloodied and thrown to the ground.

<b>

“Severe bleeding! Medical team! Hurry!!”

“Return? Just one person?! Where are the others?!”

“Captain Trevor! This is Casey from the 2nd squad! Casey Guinness!!”

“One of the advance team? You’re not a messenger?!”

<b>

“Captain! Guinness has opened his eyes!”

“Are you okay? Can you talk now?”

“He’s calling for the captain. Please do not move him.”

<b>

“Guinness, do you understand? What happened? What about the others? What happened to the battalion commander?!”

“...Y-Yes, yesterday... at 17:00... approximately 30 kilometers from here... we... encountered enemy forces... We began combat... but the difference in strength is... immense... We request immediate... defensive preparations...”

“Defensive?! Not reinforcements?! The people here can head out right away!”

“Construct the... defensive line... The enemy’s... numbers are... confirmed to be... up to 2,000... However... I cannot ascertain the total number... Quickly establish the defensive line!! They will... overflow in!!!”
