# 64 Episode The Sanctuary of Amkam

It was a small hill with a grassy area of 30 meters square.

<blank>

About five kilometers from the forest entrance, the area is already known as the middle level.

But no demonic beasts invade these hills.

It is the only safe zone in the Amcam forest.

<blank>

On the way here, there were a fair number of attacks by magical beasts.

But no one in the knights' order has ever fallen behind the hexenbiests in the realm so far.

I can say that we have come well and ripe for the first day's journey.

<blank>

"Oh! Is this the famed 'Hill of the Brave'!"

<blank>

Tony Easton, the leader of the third team, shouted with emotion as soon as he stepped onto the hill.

His face is full of joy. It is exactly the expression a boy would have when confronted with the hero of his dreams.

<blank>

The tale of the heroes is a fairy tale that has been told many times since childhood if you are from this country.

Tony Easton is naturally no exception. He has spent his boyhood yearning for tales of heroism.

<blank>

Perhaps most of those who belong to the Order of the Knights remember being as excited by the tales of the heroes as he was. They all have a twinkle in their eyes.

<blank>

This ain't no place with a name like that.

<blank>

Then a blunt, wild voice called out to me from behind Tony.

<blank>

Surprised by the sudden voice, Tony turned around to find a large man carrying a huge battle-axe standing there.

The man is looking around the hill with a quiet face, picking up his carrot-orange beard, which is the same shade of gray as the hair on his head, with his left hand, shrugging it off.

Pushing up his leather breastplate and carrying a battle-axe, he has the body of an old man approaching 70 years of age.

Everyone present could sense the fighting spirit of an overwhelmingly strong man leaking from within.

<blank>

Standing there is Konrad Blouk, former patriarch of the Blouk family, one of the 12 Amcam groups.

<blank>

Tony was so overwhelmed by Conrad's presence that for a moment he forgot to breathe and swallowed raw saliva.

<blank>

Oh ......, but no! This place was once manifested by a brave man and ......"

<blank>

It's not that big of a place!

<blank>

Nevertheless, Tony was about to tell them that many people know the name of this place and that there are numerous people who long for this place, including himself.

I wanted to let you know that I do not mean to belittle this place.

However, Tony was unable to continue because of Conrad's strong tone, as if to interrupt him.

<blank>

No, Conrad.

<blank>

Howard put his hand on Conrad's shoulder.

Conrad looks away with a single click of his tongue, and then, without anyone else in the room, he spins his words.

<blank>

This place ...... is nothing but a place where a girl only wished to return home and see her family. It's just a place where that happened a long time ago. Don't call it by such an ostentatious name."

<blank>

With that, Conrad left and went to Gilberto, who took the large luggage off his back.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Mister Meyer. Don't worry about it."

No, I'm sorry I didn't think of your feelings! I'm sorry I didn't think of your feelings ......."

<blank>

Howard and Cedric Meyer apologized to each other for the rudeness of their people.

<blank>

Just understand, Mr. Meyer. This is a place that is very dear to the people of Amkam. Some of us are somewhat reluctant to allow anyone other than the villagers to use it."

I can't thank you enough for allowing us to use it. We will use it with all possible civility!"

<blank>

Howard's face breaks at Meyer's stiff words.

<blank>

I said, "You can use it as an encampment without hesitation. Conrad may look like a good-natured guy, but he's really just a good-natured guy. I'm sure he's feeling a little embarrassed right now. I'll send him to help set up camp later.

Yes, thank you, Sir Cloud."

<blank>

When Howard asked Conrad to give him a chance to get rid of the bad impression, Meyer agreed with a smile on his face.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

"Well, what a place ......, what a place ......, what a place this is!"

<blank>

Conor Clark muttered, his face pale.

<blank>

The journey from the royal capital to reach Amkam was comfortable on well-maintained roads.

Still, in a place far from human habitation, he had experienced encounters with magical beasts in his own way.

<blank>

For Clark, who had only known life in King's Landing, seeing a magical beast for the first time was a terrifying experience.

A wild dog with red eyes. A monkey-like beast that attacked us with a strange cry. A boar as big as a calf.

I once came across a group of goblins.

<blank>

I am not very sure, but I am convinced that if we ordinary humans were to come across one, even just one magical beast would surely kill us.

<blank>

However, those of the Order defeated such fearsome opponents one after another with just one or two men.

Seeing this, Clark realized that the Knights were the strongest. He was satisfied with his own self-esteem, and at the same time, he was convinced of the safety of this trip. He was satisfied with his self-esteem, and at the same time, he was convinced of the safety of this trip.

<blank>

But what about since we came to these woods?

It's only been half a day, but what is so unusual about this forest? It is clearly different from the path we have taken so far.

<blank>

By no means are the knights struggling, but the frequency with which the demonic beasts appear is different, their numbers are different.

How many magical beasts have attacked us in the past half day?

<blank>

On this journey through the forest, there is no such thing as a carriage that used to protect me.

What in the world is that giant scorpion? I've never seen such a big gray wolf! And that huge snake with two heads!

If even one of them comes through the siege of the Knights, ....... Just imagining it makes a disgusting sweat fall down my back.

<blank>

This was a magical place, far beyond his imagination.

After only half a day, Clark was beginning to regret taking this trip.

<blank>

"......Mr. Clark, can you check this ......?"

<blank>

Clark, biting his navel, was approached by two of his subordinates who had been brought in under the guise of assisting him.

In their hands, they held a cylindrical object with a crystal ball attached and a magical mark engraved on it.

This is a magical tool that can record images by pouring a small amount of magical power into it.

<blank>

What? You guys can do that on your own! Don't bother me with all that!

No, no, I'm sorry ......, but I can't save the records without Mr. Clark's approval ......."

<blank>

Keeping track of the expedition is the reason they are accompanied by the Order.

Quicksilver cannot afford to neglect its primary task.

<blank>

Tsk! Give it to me! Give me that!

<blank>

Clark clicked his tongue abominably and roughly snatched the recording device from the hands of the staff member.

I read the records of the device, but I could not get the contents into my head.

All he could think about was how he could spend the next few days and return home safely.

Once again, Connor Clark's survival instincts screamed at the sight of the magical beast streaming from the recording device.

If push comes to shove, I must survive even if I have to use these guys as shields. The most important thing is my life! I looked at the two officials with bloodshot eyes, frustrated.

<blank>

After only half a day, just half a day through the Amcam forest, Connor Clark's spirit was beginning to creak.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Woo hoo hoo hoo." Delightful, delightful. Very funny! Oh, yeah!"

"You seem to be having a good time, Mr. Nosoli. Did something good happen to you?"

What are you talking about? "What are you talking about, Mr. Morris? What is Mr. Morris saying? I must have lost my mind!

I'm not a fool, you idiot! I'm not crazy! You're just getting heated up with all the magical beasts that keep coming in one after another!

I'm not at all! This is a great place! This place is awesome!

<blank>

What is it? You seem to be having a lot of fun and making a lot of noise. You two..."

Oh, it's Mr. Seiwashi's assistant! It's you, Mr. Seiwashi's assistant, isn't it? Do something about it! Mr. Nosoli is too boisterous for me!"

"Well, what's the matter with you? Dr. Nosoli..."

<blank>

What have you seen all the way here? This place is a treasure trove of magical creatures, or magical beasts born from the miasma that has turned into a miasma! In the shallower parts of the forest, there are still the same kind of magical denatured creatures as outside. In the shallower parts of the forest, there are still the same kind of magical degenerated creatures as outside, some of which are ordinary creatures transformed by the miasma, but if you go deeper into the forest, you'll probably find only the generated creatures! It was impossible to see magic-generating creatures so close up, and in such large numbers, in King's Landing! How can I not be excited!

Oh, I see. But please calm down, Dr. Nosoli. Your blood pressure is going to be in trouble.

<blank>

"Hmmm, what's the matter, Joseline?"

Oh, Mr. Seiwashi. Dr. Nosoli is in trouble.

"Well, I can see why Mr. Nosoli is so excited.

Is that so?"

"Well, the amount of magic in this place and its flow is extraordinary.

"Mmm! Even Mr. Seiwa is getting excited!"

It's as if there is magic from all over the world here. The deeper you go, the greater the density of magic power. The more you go deeper into the place, the more the density of magic power increases. It is a natural place for powerful magical beasts to be generated.

<blank>

Oh, Dr. Seywash, you're really turning up the heat, aren't you?

I know, don't you? But, Mr. Seiwashi. But, Mr. Seiwashi, is it safe for a normal human being to be in such a place where magic is so strong?"

"Hmm, those are the civil servants, aren't they? Well, I guess there is still no problem in this area. However, if we dive another 4 to 5 thousand meters, it will only be a matter of time unless we and the Knights are skilled in handling magic power.

"Oh, that's so hard, isn't it? Those people will be crushed under the pressure of the magic power.

Hm, Joseline, as usual, when you say it, it makes me nervous. Well, it doesn't matter anyway. The anti-magic equipment I lent you should be enough to withstand it.

'Ahhh, that's what that cape was all about!'

I see! That's a relief!"

Well, it will last another 3 to 40 kilometers," he said! If we don't do anything, we should be able to hold it for 50 kilometers or so.

<blank>

I see, that's a lot of work! It's hard work, but ...... right now I'm more interested in the structure at my feet!"

"Hmm, you mean those subterranean structures that Henry told me about in the village? It's certainly interesting."

What is it made of? Where did they mine it, where did they bring it from, and what kind of processing did they do to it?"

The magic concentration is very low and the flow is very calm in this area. It is not unreasonable to assume that there is a causal connection with the underground structure. It is worth investigating.

"Right, right? Can I check it out? Can I dig it up?"

"Stop it, you two, you'll cause trouble for the villagers if you do that.

<blank>

'Hmmm, well, I suppose I should feel bad for Mr. Henry who taught me.

"Well, Mr. Henry, it is true that he was the one who did the research here. I don't think we can dig him up without his permission.

Yes, that's right. But still...you all knew that temple director, didn't you?"

'Hmmm, you didn't know, did you? Mr. Joseline. Henry, you used to teach at the university."

It was ten years ago. Your assistant wouldn't have known about it.

"Oh, I didn't know that. That's new to me.

<blank>

He's still a fucking serious guy."

"Oh! Mr. Nosoli, you're alive!

I'm alive! Don't kill people on your own, Mr. Morris!

I thought for sure you had a severed blood vessel in your head, but I'm afraid you're all right.

What do you mean you hate me?

"Dr. Nosoli - Dr. Nosoli - I still feel like I'm going to break a blood vessel, please calm down..."

"Hmmm, Joseline, I still don't see the tension in you. "Hmmm...and Henry, you know, I thought he'd be a little more relaxed now that he's married. I thought he might be a little more relaxed now that he's married, but I guess you could say he's still the same.

"Wow, after all, I've hooked up with my student!"

"Oh, really? That serious-looking guy was messing around with your student?"

I heard that she was a forced wife. I heard that she followed Mr. Henry who left for the village and stayed there.

"Heh, either way, I'm surprised. Ah, everyone, it looks like the tents have been assembled. Please move your luggage as quickly as possible. Come on, let's get moving.

I don't need to push it, it works just fine! Mr. Seiwashi! Your assistant is as unreserved as ever with us, isn't he?

"Well, Joseline, you have no respect for us, so I don't blame you.

"Yes, please walk in a very short distance..."

It's absolutely deplorable. Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh! I can walk without pulling ......!"

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I had been invited to dinner that night by Cameron Houllier, a representative of the delegation.

Well, it's practically 'today' too. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Today is the 4th of the 2 red months. It had already been six days since Howard Papa and his family left.

<blank>

My 'search' is recognizable up to a radius of about 10 km.

It is approximately 4 km from the Amcam House to the edge of the forest.

It was another five kilometers to the "Hill of Sorrows," where Howard Papa and his friends had camped on the first day.

<blank>

The next day I left "The Hill of Sorrows" and immediately went out of my search area.

I even went to the front of the One's Tsumesho to look for it, but it was still out of my search area the next day.

<blank>

Many times I thought about sneaking into the woods to check it out.

But I feel that if I use "Invincible", AnnaMarie will notice me.

Although, I'm sure AnnaMarie would keep quiet if she noticed. ......

<blank>

Should we go deep into the forest, making no sign of them, and if there were any magical beasts that might harm Howard Papa and the others, should we quickly eliminate them before they get to him? I thought about it.

But I couldn't do it because I felt like it would hurt Howard Papa's pride.

<blank>

I am hesitant to stop or help Howard because I somehow understand the "dignity of men.

On the contrary, I don't care about those things, I want you to stay home.

There was also a great desire to have Sonia Mama by my side, which created an intense dilemma for me.

<blank>

Still, I think a fully equipped Howard Papa would slaughter it without a hitch, even against a magical beast about 50 kilometers deep in the forest.

I believe the threat value was about 100 for a magical beast at 50 km.

With that level of opponent, there is nothing to worry about for either Papa Howard or Mr. Conrad in a one-on-one fight.

But I think it's quite tough for the knights.

So it was Howard Papa's opinion that this search would not go that deep .......

<blank>

So there should be no need to worry, there should be no .............

<blank>

I don't know why, but for some reason, both Sonia-mama and I have felt a lump in our chests ever since we heard this story.

That lump is still there, of course, and it's getting a little bit bigger.

<blank>

It has been almost a week since the survey team entered the forest, so there should have been some sort of communication by messenger or something, but the fact that there is nothing makes this feeling even greater.

It's exactly one week tomorrow!

If I don't hear any news tomorrow night, I'm going into the woods tomorrow night! Already!

<blank>

<blank>

And Mr. Cameron Houllier's invitation further strokes my spirit with such melancholy.

<blank>

This is not the first time that Houllier's representative has invited me to a meeting.

Already, it's been going on since dinner the day the survey team left.

<blank>

The first night was good, though, because we were also with the Dulles and the three Croquis families.

After that, it was just me and Sonia's mother who had to deal with them.

Sonia mom had refused to have dinner with me every night for some reason, but she still insisted that I have dinner with her.

Sonia-mama had also refused the request, but she was very insistent.

So I was allowed to accept this as my role as a daughter of the Cloud family, the hosts of AMCAM.

Sonia mom was worried though. ......

<blank>

Besides, this old man already knew that I was his objective!

That's becoming more and more blatant!

The way they look at me is blatant, really!

<blank>

The nebulousness of a man's gaze, which you don't know until you've been in a woman's shoes!

I can clearly see the eyes that were on the open bosom, back, waist and buttocks of the nightdress!

I now understand that even if I pretend not to look at them and glance at them, I can still feel their eyes on me.

Ummm..! I just wanted to grind my old rice cakes with my knuckles like the idiot that I used to be!

<blank>

Well, even so, I am not so service minded as to show them to Mr. Houllier knowing that he will see them.

The only time she wore a dress that was open at the bust and back was at the welcome banquet.

The rest of the costumes are all tightly closed at the chest.

I'm not so cheap that I'm just going to expose my bare skin! Hm!

<blank>

Still, it is amazing to see the way they crawl over the clothes as if they are trying to see through the inside of the clothes!

I forgot how much a man's fantasy eye can take! Kuaaaaah~~! I'm so creeped out, I'm so creeped out!

<blank>

But still! He's a pedophile! He's so old that he's looking at a 14 year old girl with a pornographic eye!

Don't get horny with this little girl!

<blank>

............ Ng? Hmm? Huh? That's funny. I felt like I just had a big boomerang, but ......, I must be imagining things, eh! No problem! It's him! He's the person himself! It's a good thing!

<blank>

<blank>

So, to dine with such a Fourier representative, who has a big belly, a lot of baggage on his back, and a glass-half-full ulterior motive, is a real pain in the ass.

He began by boasting about himself, his life in the royal city, and how well maintained and livable the city is. The architecture is majestic and the streets are large and beautiful.

The people who live there are also very smart, and everyone wears the latest fashions with .......

Well, all those things are leaking out of Mr. Fourier's mouth.

<blank>

"What do you think? I think you might be interested in King's Landing."

......Yes, I can hear from what you're saying that it's a wonderful city.

I'm sure you're right, I'm sure you're right! If it is all right with you, Princess Suzy, I will be happy to show you around. Or, how about going to study at a school in King's Landing? I, for your sake, will spare no expense to help you! I will have a residence prepared for you immediately!

No, I appreciate the sentiment, but I will be going to school in De Kembel next year.

I see..."...... So it's the Milia Castel Eye boarding school, is it? Indeed, that boarding school is prestigious, with a sister school in King's Landing. ...... However! With all due respect, the princess is not a good person to be smoldering in the countryside like this!

"...... is, uh, rural ......, huh?"

I am sure she will be able to develop her talents in King's Landing! It is in the royal city that you will be able to develop your talents! The glamorous capital is the place for you!

<blank>

It seems that this gentleman is inviting me to come to King's Landing.

He is constantly explaining how wonderful the royal city is and how rural Amkam is.

<blank>

To be clear, I don't care about King's Landing.

Even just going to Dekenberu is too much for me. ......, how can I go to the royal capital, which is even farther away!

I can't imagine leaving Amcam ......, because I can't imagine living away from Sonia Mom or Howard Dad for an extended period of time!

<blank>

I am sure she has no idea what is going on in my heart.

They just keep pushing the King's Landing thrust into the gory details.

<blank>

...... is bad... I'm getting more and more frustrated.

This guy not only came to praise King's Landing, but also started to put down Amkam as such a remote and rural area.

<blank>

I am sorry to say this, but your father, Sir Cloud, is old enough. Wouldn't it be a filial duty to show him a refined princess in King's Landing as soon as possible?

<blank>

Oh, I've got a magic stick on me, you son of a bitch.

<blank>

He calls Howard Papa an old man with a short life expectancy for lack of a better word!

Have you not seen that dignified and supreme figure? You son of a bitch. ......

Shall I shred off that big, useless nose of yours ......?

<blank>

...............I can't...I can't...I can't...I can't...I can't. My thinking has become a little bit swarthy. I'm sorry.

Even AnnaMarie, who is accompanying him, has an unsettling look in her eyes and the atmosphere she creates.

<blank>

It's dangerous, let's pull out of this place quickly.

So I ended the conversation at an appropriate point and told Mr. Fourier I was leaving.

<blank>

I'm really tired! Dinner with Mr. Fourier!

It's like a solicitation for a suspicious circle or a religion!

...... Ha! So does that mean it's still going to go on forever unless I say no to it outright?

Uggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ......

<blank>

<blank>

I almost fainted at the thought, so I decided to have some tea made in our living room to calm down a little.

<blank>

When I entered the living room, Mama Sonia was already on the sofa.

Sonia Mama had a hoop in her hand and looked like she was being embroidered.

<blank>

When she noticed me entering the living room, she stopped her embroidery, patted the sofa seat next to her, and said with a smile and narrowed eyes, "Come next door.

<blank>

I moved quickly around the table in the large living room to be near Mama Sonia.

Then I sat down next to her so that I could stick to Sonia-mama.

<blank>

'Was everything alright?' Susie ....... Did you have any bad thoughts?"

Yes, it's all right, Sonia-mama. Everything is fine.

<blank>

Sonia mom sat down next to me and laid her hand on my hand and asked me worriedly, "Why are you doing this?

When I replied that there was nothing to worry about, Soniamama turned her attention to AnnaMarie.

<blank>

I'm at your service, ma'am. If necessary, we will take care of it as soon as possible."

<blank>

AnnaMarie answered in a matter-of-fact manner, as if she was prepping the fish she had hunted.

So, I told him to stop! Such a sword swallowing thing!

<blank>

Sonia smiled at AnnaMarie as if she was troubled, then dropped her gaze at me and asked me if I needed to take a break.　She asked Elrose to prepare some tea.

<blank>

<blank>

This living room where we are now is between my room and the bedrooms of Sonia-mama and Howard-papa.

Of course, it is the living room of the Amcam House, so it is many times larger than the living room in your house!

This place alone is about the size of a school classroom.

<blank>

The mantelpiece is huge and gorgeous.

It's probably twice as big as what you have at home.

The sofa and table I am sitting at now are also chic but still magnificent.

The frame is made with gentle curves, and the intertwining reliefs of plants are carefully and finely carved, as if to show off the craftsmanship of the artist.

The sofa, upholstered in red velvet, is soft and comfortable, too luxurious for me, a commoner.

<blank>

Ahhhh, I can't wait to get yukked up in my living room~~.......

<blank>

<blank>

Howard, you know, used to be so calm, he was hardly ever in the village ......."

<blank>

Mama Sonia began to tell a story as if she was quietly murmuring while placing a teacup on a cup saucer in her hand.

<blank>

The story is about Howard Papa.

Neither I nor Sonia's mother consider Mr. Fourier to be of any particular importance. Our feelings are quickly disconnected.

I'm still concerned about Howard's dad, after all. It's been a week now. We both can't help but feel that way.

<blank>

I leaned against the right side of Sonia Mama as if to lean on her body, looking up at her face and waiting for her to continue her story.

<blank>

"I often had to leave the village for requests from other places, but it was usually for exploration that took me deep into the forest. ...... He always said, even as a child, that it was his mission to explore as much of Irosio as he could.

<blank>

Sonia Mama laughed a little and looked down into her teacup, as if she was finding a shadow of her past on the surface of the tea.

<blank>

It's only been a week this time, but it was not uncommon for me to not hear from her for a month or two ......, or worse, for her to not come back from Ilocio for six months. It never occurred to me how worried I was each time. She would always say, "Sonia, I'm back now," and then she would hug me and smile happily. I'd say, "Welcome back, Howard. You're not tired? I would always say, 'No, I'm not tired. I always answered, "No, I'm not tired," because I didn't want to let him know how worried I was. So I would answer her as curtly as I could.

<blank>

I thought it was very fresh and cute that Mama Sonia spoke in a slightly sultry tone.

I can't help but think of the exchange between Howard's dad and Sonia's mom at that time.

<blank>

Howard stayed home more often after Ravi was born. Then when Ravi turned five, he announced his retirement and chose to retire from the front lines. ......

<blank>

Soniamama then turned her attention to the picture frame on the mantelpiece.

<blank>

Yes, there are pictures in this world. Though in black and white.

It looks much more out of focus than it was in the original world. It's still a poorly crafted photograph, as if it were of an old samurai or something.

<blank>

Now, on the mantelpiece of this living room, there were several photos brought from home.

Sonia-mama brought it to us because she would not be able to go home for a while.

<blank>

A picture of me, Sonia's mom, and Howard's dad, one of each of us. A family photo of all three of us together. Howard when he was a young man. Sonia's mom when she was young. And a photo of Ravi from .......

Ravi's photos had been stored away for a long time without being displayed. He said he had not been able to look at them properly for years.

After the family photo was taken, Sonia-mama said she wanted to put them together, so she took them out of the back of her desk and put them next to my photo.

I remember how happy Mama Sonia was when she said, "Now we can stay together as a family.

<blank>

Now, while looking at that picture of Mr. Ravi, Sonia-mama continued her story.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to go to Irosio, but it's a good idea to go to Irosio. The same light was in her eyes when she said she was going to go to Irosio as she had been back then. The truth is,......, I didn't want her to go to Ilocio, you know? I really wanted to stop him,...... but when I saw his eyes like that, I couldn't stop him very much. After all, he is ...... Howard is an Amkam man and I am an Amkam woman. No matter how far I go, that's something that will never change. ......"

<blank>

I put the tea cup on the table, and Mama Sonia gently patted my head as I snuggled up to her.

I grasp the other Sonia's hand with both of mine and lean in closer.

<blank>

But don't worry ......, it'll be fine. Howard always came back without incident. It's the same ...... this time. He'll come back with a smile on his face and say, 'I'm back now,' like he always does. So ............ don't worry."

<blank>

Sonia Mama kept telling me over and over again, 'It's okay.

<blank>

As if you were saying it to yourself, over and over again, .......

I silently looked up at Mama Sonia and continued to hold her hand.

2 Red Moon 5, 4:05 AM

In the still pre-dawn twilight, the rear-guard unit of the Mobile Heavy Knights stationed at the "Hill of Sorrows" was suddenly engulfed in a clamor of events.

<blank>

Of the backstopping units from Group 7 to Group 10, Group 9 and Group 10 are waiting in Amkam village.

Currently, a total of 20 people, 10 from Group 7 and 8 and 10 from the logistics unit, were on standby duty at "Hill of Sorrows" as a campsite, waiting for word from the front line and preparing for supply.

<blank>

Now, a knight on a black horse came galloping into the campsite from deep in the woods at a furious pace.

The hastily constructed fence was overthrown, the bonfire was knocked down, and the horse fell over, foaming on the spot.

Those on horseback were also covered in blood and thrown to the ground.

<blank>

'Bleeding badly! Sanitation team! Hurry up!

"Return? All alone? Where are the others?

"Captain Trevor! This is Casey from Team 2! Casey Guinness!

"One of the advance party? You're not a messenger?

<blank>

Squad Leader! Guinness has opened his eyes!"

Are you all right?" Can we talk now?"

I'm calling for the group leader. Please do not move him.

<blank>
