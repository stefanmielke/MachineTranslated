# Chapter 177: Showtime

I think it's been almost an hour since I sent Chidori flying.

I was told to wait for a while, but isn't this seriously too long to keep me waiting?

<b>

...Could it be that they're really preparing for a welcome party?

No way! If that's the case, they're making the guests wait way too long! I've been standing here since I entered the room! So annoying!

Well, there is an old bench inside the room, so it's not like I can't sit on it... 

But it's just too dirty.

It's covered in something mossy, and there are all sorts of stains that I can't quite identify, making it quite repulsive.

What on earth was spilled here?!

<b>

Even though this dress was prepared on short notice, the pleats of the skirt and the way the frills are attached are kind of cute. The color is also to my liking.

So, I really don't want to sit defenselessly in this filthy place and dirty my lovely dress.

That's why I've been standing for about an hour now.

<b>

<b>

After a while, finally, someone came towards me.

Three people, I think? For now, I should put the blindfold back on.

<b>

The one who opened the door seemed surprised to see me standing right in front of him.

What’s the deal? Is it surprising that I'm standing here?

<b>

After a brief pause, he approached me and started fiddling with the handcuffs.

The man quickly stepped back, but I felt the handcuffs being pulled, and he said, "Follow me."

<b>

It seems he tied a string or rope to the handcuffs and is pulling it. I followed him out of the room.

<b>

The man pulling me along, with two others following closely behind me.

Without caring that I can't see due to the blindfold, the man walked down the stone corridor without hesitation.

<b>

“...Hey, how can you walk normally with that? You raised it to 50, right?”

“How would I know?! Ask the one who operated it!”

“Don't mess with me, you idiot! Do you want to die?!”

<b>

It seems the two behind me are whispering to each other. I don't know what they're talking about, but their hushed voices are echoing quite a bit.

<b>

“Shut up and walk!!”

““S-Sorry!””

“Tch!”

<b>

See, they got scolded.

The man in front clicked his tongue in annoyance but kept walking without stopping.

We continued walking for a while, but it seems we still haven't reached our destination.

I think the place we're aiming for is that circular area where a lot of people are gathered... but we're taking quite a detour.

<b>

After being led around in circles, I was finally told to stop. It seems we've finally arrived at our destination.

I heard the sound of a heavy door opening right in front of me, and I felt the wind brush against my cheek. I could sense the cool autumn night air slightly prickling my skin. I realized I had entered a spacious area.

<b>

I was then led further, probably to the middle of that space.

<b>

“Remove the blindfold.”

<b>

A voice called from above, and the blindfold was immediately taken off me. The men who brought me here ran away from the scene as if escaping.

<b>

<b>

As my surroundings were revealed, I looked around and realized that this place is indeed like a circular arena.

However, it isn't as large as a coliseum. It's about 20 meters in diameter?

The stone walls surrounding it look ancient and have a distinctly historical feel. They might not even be three meters high.

There’s no ceiling, and I can see the starry night sky. When the door to this place was opened, it felt like stepping outside.

This place might have originally been a training facility for a fortress.

<b>

On top of the walls, there are steps arranged like spectator seats.

Many men are peering over the edge, looking down at me with gleaming eyes. There are probably about 50 to 60 of them. They all have rather unsightly faces.

<b>

“Thank you for your hard work. It must have been tough to get here.”

<b>

In the front row? Or is it a dais? Three men are seated, all looking down at me.

On the right side is an old man with a bald head and a long white beard, his three white eyes giving him a rather villainous look.

On the left is a big, dark-skinned man with a bushy beard, looking very much like a mountain bandit.

<b>

And in the center, a man sitting in a particularly large chair, leaning back and looking down at me.

He calls himself the “Advisor.”

If he claims not to be the boss, then what on earth is he?

<b>

“No, not particularly.”

<b>

“Is your attitude one of commendable patience, or are you simply oblivious? Heh heh...! Well, anyway, the preparations for the welcome are complete. That's why we called you here.”

<b>

When I answered him curtly, he raised his eyebrows slightly for just a moment but quickly let out a laugh that sounded amused.

His reptilian-like cold gaze and bloodless white face are truly unsettling.

Still, he sure is rude! This guy!!

<b>

“Isn't it taking too long for a welcome? I don't think it's right to keep a lady waiting.”

<b>

“Ahaha! How rude! I wanted you to rest a bit after your long journey! How are you feeling? Have you had enough time to recover?”

<b>

“I just had too much time on my hands.”

<b>

“...You're still a feisty young lady. You can't possibly be truly insensitive, can you...? It’s not good for your body to keep up this facade. You're wearing something that weighs that much. Why not show it on your face a little?”

<b>

What on earth is this guy talking about?

What does he mean by “keeping up a facade”? What weight?

<b>

“Since you arrived at this fortress, the weight of those handcuffs has been raised to 50 kilograms. We are surprised that you managed to walk all the way here.”

<b>

Oh?! They increased the weight of the handcuffs?!

Oh no! I didn’t notice at all!

Now that I think about it, after we arrived at this historical site, that guy was fiddling with the handcuffs, right? And he was laughing in a rather unpleasant way?

...Now that I think about it, it did feel like the weight increased at that moment... maybe...?

<b>

Grrr! Even if they call me “insensitive” again, I can't find a retort!

I thought I had lowered my physical level to the minimum, but maybe I accidentally exerted myself when I met that mother and daughter in the basement? Did I let my strength overflow from that point?!

No, no, wait! There’s also the possibility that the handcuffs aren’t functioning properly!

There’s no need to panic clumsily in a place like this! Calm down! I need to calm down!

<b>

Upon observing the handcuffs again, it seems they are imbued with a “mass increase” magic.

I don’t feel like there’s a magic battery in them... Could it be that they’re using the wearer’s magical power to activate the magic?

I see, so the more weight they add, the more stamina and magical power they consume, wearing down both body and mind.

That’s quite brutal, isn’t it?!

<b>

<b>

“I understand that MacGavin is trying to deepen his relationship with the Bradley family. If the security team he’s preparing is fully implemented, the once-dead Bradley might just come back to life.”

<b>

Suddenly, the old man sitting to the right of the “Advisor” started talking.

Bradley is the family name of the head of the Karnaflemel County.

According to Roderick, they are currently facing significant internal unrest.

So these guys are indeed scheming within the county.

<b>

“We have spent considerable time and effort nurturing this up to this point. It is indeed a very concerning matter for us.”

<b>

“However, this time! It was quite fortuitous that we were tasked with dealing with MacGavin! Thanks to that, we can wipe out the resistance in one fell swoop!”

<b>

The mountain bandit-like big man also began to raise his voice. His voice is so loud that it seems to vibrate the surrounding air.

<b>

“If you truly are the daughter of some old noble, we could have proposed a ransom along with luring out MacGavin...”

“But! You certainly don’t look like an ordinary girl!!”

<b>

What are these guys?

Aren't they being a bit rude?! Hey!

From any angle, I look like a proper noble lady, don’t I?

How can they see me otherwise?!

<b>

“An ordinary noble lady wouldn’t be able to respond calmly while I’m exerting pressure on her face-to-face. Even now, with this much pressure around you, you’re still calm. That’s not normal.”

“...Is that so?”

<b>

Was it showing on my face? I thought I was keeping it together, but the “Advisor” said with a smirk that I was “different from the norm.”

<b>

Ah, so that’s it. I was under pressure in the carriage.

I didn’t notice it at all...

Even if they call me “insensitive” again, I still have no retort! Damn it!!

<b>

“Therefore, I judged you to be a rather composed bouncer. It seems you are indeed worthy of being hired by MacGavin. Is that what it is?”

<b>

“That’s quite a bold deduction.”

<b>

“So, we decided to call him here. Your job is to find our hideout, right? That’s why you’ve come along quietly up to this point. Did you manage to contact MacGavin with the time we gave you earlier?”

<b>

Oh? Did they notice that I sent Chidori flying?

No, they probably don’t know about Chidori specifically.

That’s a bit out of the ordinary. The existence of something like that is beyond common sense.

But perhaps they have some idea that I contacted him by some means.

<b>

“So? Are you planning to have the people gathered here deal with Roderick and the others?”

<b>

“No matter how skilled a bouncer is, they are still just one team! Even if you combine MacGavin’s escort with the ragtag county knights, it wouldn’t even reach 50! Moreover, nearly half of them have already started heading south on the southern road to rescue hostages!!”

<b>

“...Hostages?”

<b>

“Why do you think I went all the way to the hideout in the city? It was to prepare for this.”

<b>

“Prepare?”

<b>

“Just to make sure you can't escape easily, I’ll do a little bit of processing. ...Just a little bit, heh heh...”

<b>

Saying that, he lightly waved his fingers as if to cut something. Then he let out a laugh that was unpleasantly reminiscent of a throat-clearing sound.

<b>

“...Could it be that the mother I saw in the basement, her toes... was it you?”

<b>

“Ah, yes. I have no intention of passing up such fun to anyone else. ...Oh? Didn’t I mention this before?”

<b>

I see, he’s a hardcore sadist.

He’s the type who would appear in front of others just to satisfy his own hobbies.

<b>

“There’s also the option of taking down those lurking on the roads one by one to weaken MacGavin’s forces, but we have no intention of employing such foolish tactics.”

<b>

“MacGavin, who was lured here by you! We will take him down with our maximum force all at once!!”

<b>

“I admire your courage for coming in alone. You might have had a plan to escape from here, but we have no intention of allowing that. That’s why we made you wear those from the start.”

<b>

“Those? These utterly unlovable handcuffs? If possible, I would have preferred something with a bit more charm in its design.”

<b>

“...You’re still an unlovable lady even at this point. Listen, a magical power of 50 is not a number to be underestimated. The fact that you can use magic means just that. That’s why it’s called a ‘binding magical tool.’ It seals your magic. Didn’t you notice?”

<b>

Yes! I didn’t notice at all!

Binding magical tool? Sealing magic?

Huh? But I used Heal in the basement, right? I also cast buffs, didn’t I?

Hmm――――――？

<b>

“I’m curious to see how long you can keep that composed face.”

<b>

Saying that, he snapped his fingers.

At that signal, the large door in front of me in the arena creaked open.

<b>

From the darkness beyond, multiple beastly growls echoed.

Eventually, a magical beast with red lights in its eyes slowly emerged from the depths.

<b>

The creature that appeared is called a “Scale Jaguar.”

It’s a magical beast resembling a large feline, and as the name suggests, its entire body is covered in scales.

Its slender and flexible body has high agility, and it excels in three-dimensional movements, attacking from above the trees.

Its scales are quite tough, so it would be difficult for the weapons held by the city guards to penetrate its armor.

<b>

“Now, that beast will be your opponent. Please enjoy yourself with it.”

<b>

With the appearance of the magical beast, the men packed into the audience began to stomp their feet and shout loudly.

The air in the arena trembled with the constant roar from the crowd.

<b>

“You're... controlling the magical beast?”

<b>

Controlling a magical beast is something that normally shouldn’t be possible. But I’ve seen it before. Is it trending recently?

This isn’t something anyone can do so easily. I see, so the root is the same.

<b>

“That beast will knock you down, drag you around, and toy with you like a rag doll! Please showcase your beautiful face trembling in fear, distorted in pain, and crying out!”

<b>

When he raised his voice particularly loudly, the men in the audience responded by raising their voices even more.

<b>

“No matter how much your body is torn apart or your insides spill out, as long as you can scream, it will continue!”

<b>

On the other hand, he seemed to be getting excited, standing up and starting to speak with grand gestures.

His voice was gradually becoming more heated.

<b>

“But rest assured! No matter how much you’re hurt, there’s a wonderful medicine that can restore you back to your original beautiful self! I’ll make sure to return your face and body to their proper form!”

<b>

His speech was reaching a fever pitch. As his volume increased, his theatrical movements became more exaggerated. It was truly unsettling.

<b>

“...However, your hands and feet are a different story. We don’t need those! We’ll cut off your delicate elbows and knees! Then you will live as a ‘human dog’! First, I will personally train you as a dog, and after thoroughly using you, I’ll satisfy everyone in the fortress!!”

<b>

The excitement of the men surged, shaking the walls and the ground, their shouts echoing throughout the arena.

Is he out of his mind? This guy.

He looks like someone who’s high on some dangerous drug?!

So creepy!

<b>

“And if you’re still alive... I’ll offer you to the wealthy perverts abroad. I’m sure they’ll be delighted to purchase you.”

<b>

His smile stretched impossibly wide, showing me a malicious grin.

I see, he means to toy with me until I die.

It’s giving me the creeps. It’s really giving me the creeps.

<b>

“Please direct all your resentment towards MacGavin, who sent you here. Now! The curtain rises on an exhilarating showtime!!”

<b>

And he let out a dry laugh from deep in his throat, as if to shower me with it.

Well, this was a perfect scene to understand just how creepy his sadism is.

As these guys heated up, my mind grew colder.

<b>

<b>

“Lastly, let me confirm something. What happened to Walter Miller?”

<b>

Amidst the unsettling laughter of that guy and the horrifying screams of the men, I wanted to confirm one thing.

The surrounding noise hasn’t died down, but my voice seemed to reach him clearly.

He raised his eyebrows slightly in surprise for a moment, but then spoke calmly.

<b>

“...Ah, the one you mentioned in the carriage. Sorry, but I’ve dealt with most of those who got involved with me. To be honest, I don’t really remember who you’re talking about. Heh heh.”

<b>

That means he’s certain about what happened to Mr. Miller.

Even if he says he doesn’t remember, his amused squinting eyes tell a different story.

<b>

“You didn’t just happen to run into Mr. Miller, did you? ...Who did you ask for help?”

“Like I said, I don’t remember, young lady.”

“Was it Lawrence Niven?”

<b>

“Enough already! You little brat!!”

<b>

The dark-skinned big man shouted angrily.

His voice was filled with pressure, shaking the air.

It seems my assessment didn’t sit well with him.

<b>

“You’re done here! Quietly let the magical beast tear you apart and show us your miserable cries!!”

<b>

“Uh, so, is the leader of the ‘Blue Fang’ Bagat and the leader of the ‘Cursed Serpent’ Garey, right?”

<b>

The bandit-like Bagat and the old man Garey.

When I called their names, the two opened their eyes and froze in place.

<b>

“‘Blue Viper’ is the name used when moving the ‘Blue Fang’ and ‘Cursed Serpent’ together, right? And there are also a bunch of miscellaneous thieves, right? ...Oh, and are there knights from some country? Are they active? About three squads, I think?”

<b>

“You...! What are you saying!!”

<b>

“I heard that ‘Goul’ doesn’t show up in public, but I see, you... ‘molt,’ don’t you?”

“Do it!!!”

<b>

The “Advisor,” also known as “Goul,” spoke in an unusually low voice.

<b>

Suddenly, three magical beasts charged towards me.

Their movements were coordinated as they crossed paths and switched positions.

<b>

In the blink of an eye, they closed the distance, relentlessly trying to stab and tear me apart with their claws and fangs.

But, of course, they didn’t even graze me.

<b>

Oh, but did one just barely graze the frill of my skirt?

Ah! It tore just a little bit!! You little bastards!

<b>

I was momentarily annoyed, so I kicked the jaw of the magical beast that scratched me!

In that instant, the chains attached to my feet snapped off without resistance. Oh right, I had those on, didn’t I?

<b>

With a sound like a large paper bag bursting, the upper half of the magical beast exploded like a water balloon.

Its lower half was blown away by the force, spinning rapidly as it flew towards the wall in front of me.

The creature that had slammed into the wall became a stain on it, scattering the pieces of flesh that made up its body around the area. Wow, that was quite a splatter. If it had been in vivid colors, it might have been a bit fancy!

<b>

The audience members who were showered with the remnants of the magical beast seemed to be in shock, not understanding what had just happened.

<b>

“““...........Huh?”””

<b>

The three sitting above looked down with dazed expressions.

The arena, which had been noisy just a moment ago, fell silent in an instant.

But I think it’s still too early to be dazed?

<b>

<b>

For now, since they said I couldn’t use magic because of the handcuffs, let’s give it a little test.

<b>

Now that I’ve exploded one of the three magical beasts, the remaining two instinctively jumped back, perhaps sensing danger.

I raised my hand towards the one that jumped to the right, aiming carefully.

<b>

“Fire Strike”

It’s my initial single-target attack spell that I already possess.

I’ve overdone it with this spell many times before, so I won’t forget to hold back the magical power!

I gently extended three fingers—my thumb, index, and middle finger—like I was pinching a ping pong ball, carefully squeezing out the magical power.

<b>

The fireball that appeared at the tip of my fingers, about 5 centimeters in diameter, struck the magical beast the moment it manifested.

The suddenly heated air expanded rapidly, creating a thunderous roar as it blew the magical beast to smithereens.

<b>

<b>

I can still use magic normally!

<b>

The wall that was in the line of fire was blown away along with the audience seats, about 5 meters wide.

With the wall blown out, the airflow became quite pleasant.

There were about ten thieves caught in the audience who got caught up in the blast. Some of them are in pretty bad shape... but I guess it’s not worth worrying about.

<b>

<b>

Now, let’s see how the regular version of the spell works.

This time, I’ll imagine pinching with my left thumb and index finger and shorten the incantation to just the spell name.

<b>

“Fire Bread”

This time, a fireball the size of a marble appeared at my fingertips.

Hmm? I felt a slight haze, but it didn’t hinder the spell activation.

<b>

The released fireball made a light popping sound as it flew straight towards the Scale Jaguar, sinking into its forehead.

The flames burned and charred the insides of the magical beast, which collapsed right there.

<b>

<b>

“...I can use it, huh?”

<b>

I can use magic, but what does this mean? I shot a side-eye at Goul on the dais.

<b>

I think this binding magical tool interferes with the wearer’s spiritual seal, hindering the manifestation of magic.

However, if you exert magical power that exceeds that capacity, the interference becomes meaningless.

It’s like a small wave being swallowed by a big wave.

<b>

Thinking it’s a rather pointless item, I decided to check the engraved magical seals and twisted a bit... only for it to snap easily.

I knew it was fragile!

<b>

“...What the hell is going on?!”

<b>

Oh? Goul’s language seems to have gotten rough.

<b>

“We had no intention of gradually deploying our forces from the start.”

<b>

“What do you mean?!”

<b>

“I said we came to strike with our maximum force from the beginning.”

<b>

“What are... you saying?”

<b>

“Well then, you lot.”

<b>

I lowered my right hand to my side, bent slightly at the waist, and extended my left elbow outward while opening my palm in front of my face, glaring at the dais through the gaps between my fingers.

<b>

“...Since when did you think you had a choice?”

<b>

Oops, I ended up striking a pose in the moment.

<b>

----------------

Suzie: “I’m going to... 56 vinegar.”

Goul: “What’s with this person?”

I won’t self-destruct.
