# 177 Showtime

I think it has been almost an hour since I flew the plover.

They told me to wait a while, but seriously, aren't they making me wait too long?

<blank>

...... You don't really think you're preparing for a welcome party, do you?

No, if that's the case, you're making your guests wait too long! We've been on our feet since we entered the room! Pfft!

Well, there is one old bench in the room, so there is nothing you can't sit on. ......

It's just too dirty.

There were moss-like growths and some kind of stain that I couldn't understand, and it was oddly fearless.

What the heck is this after all the blather?

<blank>

This dress was prepared on short notice. The pleats on the skirt and the way the ruffles are attached to the hem are a little cute. The color is also my favorite.

So, well, I don't want to sit here unprotected in a dingy place and stain my cute little dress.

So I've been on my feet for the past hour.

<blank>

<blank>

After a while, someone finally came toward my place.

Three? In the meantime, let's put back the blindfolds we shifted.

<blank>

When he opened the door, he was surprised to see me standing right in front of him.

What? Would it surprise you if I were standing there?

<blank>

After a beat, he approached me, came to my side, and started clinking something on his manacles.

The man backed away immediately, but I felt something pull at my shackles. Then he said, "Follow me.

<blank>

Apparently, he had some kind of string or rope strapped to his manacles and was pulling on them. I followed the man as he pulled me and left the room.

<blank>

A man pulls me and two others come from behind to flank me.

The man walked down the stone passageway without a care in the world for me, who was blindfolded and unable to see.

<blank>

"...... Hey, how come you can walk normally with that thing up to 50?"

'I don't give a damn! Tell it to the guy who operated it!"

"Are you kidding me, asshole? You wanna die?

<blank>

There's some kind of whispering between the two people behind me. I don't know what they're talking about, but for a whisper, the sound is echoing, okay?

<blank>

Shut up and walk!

"Sorry, sorry."

Tsk!"

<blank>

Hola I was angry.

The man in front of me clicked his tongue in annoyance, but kept going without stopping.

Then we kept walking for a while again, but we still didn't seem to get where we wanted to go.

Maybe what you're aiming for is that round circle where a lot of people are gathered. ......, you're taking a very big turn.

<blank>

After being made to walk in circles, I was finally told to stop. It seemed that we had finally arrived at the place we were aiming for.

I thought I heard a heavy door open in front of me, and I felt the wind on my cheek. I felt a slight sting of the autumn night wind on my skin. I knew I was in a large space.

<blank>

I was made to walk again and was brought to about the middle of the space.

<blank>

Take off the blindfold for him."

<blank>

A voice from above called out to me and immediately removed the blindfold from me. After the blindfold was removed, the men who had brought me ran away from the place.

<blank>

<blank>

I looked around again as my eyes were exposed, and I realized that this was indeed a place like an amphitheater.

However, it is not so big as to be called a colosseum. It is about 20 meters in diameter.

The stone wall that surrounds it is old and looks like a historic site. It is no more than three meters high.

There is no ceiling and a starry night sky. This is why I felt like I was outside when the door to this place was opened.

Maybe this place used to be a fort training facility or something.

<blank>

The top of the wall was lined with tiers in a mortar shape, like spectator seats.

Many men are standing on the edge of the wall, peering at us with glazed eyes. There are about 50 to 60 of them. All of them have vulgar faces.

<blank>

Thank you for your hard work. It must have been hard to get here."

<blank>

Front seating? A dais? Three men were sitting on the dais, all looking down at us.

On the right side is an old man with a balding head and a white hermit's beard. The scar on his head is a bandit-like scar.

To his left is a large, black, lanky man with a beard, who looks like a bandit.

<blank>

In the middle of the room, a man sits in a large chair and looks down at us.

He calls himself a 'consultant.

If that's not the boss, then what the hell is?

<blank>

No, not particularly.

<blank>

Is your attitude admirable patience or just plain insensitivity? Kuhkuh ......! Well, at least we are ready to welcome you. I have invited you to join us.

<blank>

When I answered him curtly, his eyebrows moved slightly for a moment, but then he immediately burst into a throaty laugh as if he was amused.

His reptilian cold eyes and bloodless white face are truly uncanny.

But still, he's rude to me! This guy!

<blank>

"You're taking too long to get ready for the welcome party, aren't you? I don't think we should keep the ladies waiting too long, do you?"

<blank>

Kuhkuhkuh." Excuse me! I wanted you to get some rest after your long trip! How are you doing? Are you rested enough?

<blank>

I just had too much time on my hands."

<blank>

'...... You're still a bossy young lady. I don't think you are really insensitive. ...... It's not good for you to be so skinny. You're wearing something that weighs that much. Why don't you show it in your face a little?"

<blank>

What has this guy been saying all this time?

What's skinny? What's the weight of what?

<blank>

When we arrived at this fort, we raised the weight of those manacles to 50 kilograms. Now we're amazed that they even made it this far on foot."

<blank>

Oh? Did you say the shackles were getting heavier?

Oh no! I hadn't noticed that at all!

I remember after we arrived at this historic site, he was touching his manacles? And then, he was laughing like a jerk, wasn't he?

......If you ask me, it seemed like the weight increased at that time, ...... but it didn't ......... ...no?

<blank>

Gnnnnnnnnnnn! I can't find the words to reply if you call me "insensitive" again now!

I thought I had reduced my own physical level to the bare minimum, but when I met the mother and daughter in the basement, was it because I got a little too powerful? Was it because I was overflowing with power from that area?

No, no, no, wait! It's possible that the shackles aren't working properly to begin with!

There's no need to be so foolishly upset in a place like this! Calm down! Calm down, I am!

<blank>

Observing the shackles again, it seems that the shackles have a "mass-increasing" magic attached to them.

It doesn't feel like there is a magic battery. ...... Is this using the wearer's magical power to activate the magic?

I see, the heavier the weight, the more physical and magical power it consumes, and the more it reduces both body and mind.

Is it moderately egregious?

<blank>

<blank>

We know that McGovern is trying to deepen his relationship with the Bradleys. Once the security force he is preparing is in place, the Bradleys, who have been on the verge of death, could come back to life.

<blank>

The old man sitting to the right of some 'advisor' suddenly started talking.

Bradley is the family name of the head of Carnafraemer County.

Roderick told me that they are having a great deal of anxiety about internal affairs right now.

I knew these guys were in the dark inside the county.

<blank>

We have spent a lot of time and effort to bring them up to this point," he said. For us, it is a very serious matter.

<blank>

But this time! It was a great opportunity for me to get rid of McGovern! Now we can wipe out the resistance in one fell swoop!"

<blank>

A large man who looked like a bandit also began to raise his voice. But still, his voice is so loud. The air around us is vibrating.

<blank>

If you really are the daughter of some old nobleman, I had a plan to lure McGovern out with a ransom demand. ......

"But! She doesn't look like a normal girl by any stretch of the imagination!"

<blank>

What's with these guys?

These guys are just as rude as they sound, aren't they? Hey!

From all appearances, she is a respectable young lady, isn't she?

How can you tell me it looks any other way?

<blank>

An ordinary young lady would not have the guts to be so nonchalant in the face of my constant pressure on her. Even now, I am under so much pressure from the people around me, and she seems unconcerned. I am not ordinary.

"............ yes, is that right?"

<blank>

Was it on my face? I thought it would never happen, but the "advisor" said to me with a wry smile, "It's not normal.

<blank>

Oh, I see, you were pressured in the carriage.

I didn't even notice it, .......

I have no words to reply to the word "insensitive" again, right? Damn!

<blank>

"So I judged her to be a bouncer lady with a moderately strong liver. She is only hired by McGovern. Is that what you're saying?"

<blank>

It's a bold guess, yes.

<blank>

So we decided to call him in. Your job is to track down our hideout, isn't it? That's why you've followed us all the way here. Were you able to contact McGovern in the time I just gave you?"

<blank>

Oh, no, did you notice that I flew the plover?

No, you don't even know what a plover is, do you?

It's a little bit out of the ordinary. It's out of the realm of common sense that something like that could exist.

But I wonder if they have a bite that they have been contacted in some way.

<blank>

So what do you think? So, what do you think, we'll take the guys we've got here now to deal with Mr. Roderick and the others?"

<blank>

No matter how good a bouncer you are, you are only a team! McGovern's bodyguards and a small group of county knights combined have less than 50 cavalrymen at best! And nearly half of them have started to head south on the southern road to rescue the hostages!

<blank>

...... hostages?"

<blank>

Why do you think I went all the way to your hideout in the city? To do some preliminary work.

<blank>

"Preparation?"

<blank>

What? We're going to give you a little something so you can't get away with it so easily. ...... only a little. Damn ......."

<blank>

Then he lightly shook his aligned fingertips as if he was going to cut something off. Then he let out a throaty, sickening laugh.

<blank>

"...... by any chance, your mother's toes in the basement, ............ Anta, were?"

<blank>

Oh, yes, I do. I'm not going to give up this kind of fun to anyone else. ...... Oh? Didn't I mention this before?"

<blank>

So, this guy is a hard-core abuser.

Is he the type of person who would come out in public with impunity to satisfy his own interests?

<blank>

There is a way to reduce McGovern's strength by setting up a string of lurkers on the streets, but we have no intention of making a foolhardy attempt to deploy our forces one after the other."

<blank>

McGovern, who was lured to this fort by you! I will slaughter you at once with my full strength!"

<blank>

I admire your strength to come in here by yourself," he said. I'm not sure if you had a plan to get out of here somehow, but I have no intention of allowing you to do that. That's why I had you wear it from the beginning.

<blank>

"Sole? These shackles that lack any cuteness? In any case, I would have preferred something with a more adorable design.

<blank>

I'm not a pretty young lady here at ....... May I? 50 magic power is not a number to be underestimated. That's what it means to be able to use magic. That's why it's the "binding magical tool". It seals your magic. Didn't you notice?"

<blank>

Hi! I was not aware of this!

A binding magical tool? Sealing magic?

What? But I used heals in the basement, didn't I? I buffed it, too, right?

Hmmm ------?

<blank>

Let's see how long you can keep that smug look on your face.

<blank>

When he said this, the guy snapped one finger.

At the same time as the signal, the large door in front of me on the arena wall is opened with a creaking sound.

<blank>

From the darkness behind it, multiple snarls of the beast echoed.

Soon, a magical beast with red lights in its eyes slowly emerged from behind it.

<blank>

What came out was a magical beast called "Scale Jaguar.

It is a magical beast with a large feline appearance, and as its name suggests, its entire body is covered with scales.

Its thin, supple body is highly athletic, and it is a magical beast that specializes in three-dimensional movements, attacking from the tops of trees.

Its scales are also quite hard, so it would be difficult to penetrate its armor with the weapons of the city guards.

<blank>

The animal will be your partner from now on. Please let him take care of you."

<blank>

With the appearance of the magical beast, the men who had packed the auditorium began stomping their feet and shouting wildly.

The air in the arena is shaken by the incessant shouts of anger raised by those around them.

<blank>

"Manipulating a hexenbiest with ......?"

<blank>

It's not normal to be able to control a magical beast or something like that. But I saw that a while ago. Is it even trending these days?

This is not something anyone can do so easily. So the root of the problem is the same.

<blank>

They will beat you, drag you around and play with you like a rag! Show them how your beautiful face shakes with fear and cries out in pain!

<blank>

When he raises his voice, the men in the audience respond by raising their voices even louder.

<blank>

Whether your body is shredded or your entrails are spilled, it will continue as long as your squeals are heard!"

<blank>

On the other hand, the guy started to get excited, got up and started talking with big gestures.

The tone of his voice is becoming more and more passionate.

<blank>

But don't worry! No matter how damaged you are, there is a wonderful medicine that can restore you to your original beauty! I will restore your face and body to the same beautiful, even tone!

<blank>

His speech is on a roll. As the volume of his voice rises, so does his theatrical movements. It was really creepy.

<blank>

You can find the answer at "............, but not the limbs. We don't need limbs! Let's cut off the ends of those skinny elbows and knees! And you will live as a 'man-dog! I will train him first as a dog myself, and after I have used him enough, he will satisfy all the men of the fort!

<blank>

As if the excitement of the bastards had swept over them, the walls are shaking, the ground is shaking, and angry shouts are echoing all over the arena.

Are you crazy? This guy.

It looks like someone who has decided to take some bad medicine?

It's so gross!

<blank>

"If you are still alive, please contact us at ....... We can offer you even the wealthiest of out-of-country vices. I am sure they would be happy to purchase it."

<blank>

His mouth turns up to an unbelievable level and he flashes a malicious smile at me.

I see... so you want me to play with you until you die.

It's creepy. It's really creepy.

<blank>

"You should hate McGovern as much as you can for sending you here. Come on! It's time for the exciting show!

<blank>

And then he raises a dry laugh from the back of his throat, as if to shower me with it.

Yes, it was an act that really showed the grossness of this guy's addictive nature.

My head was really cold in the face of these guys as they heated up.

<blank>

<blank>

Let me ask you one last time. What did you do with Mr. Walter Miller at ......?"

<blank>

While the man's sickening laughter and the men's horrified screams have yet to subside, I have to confirm one thing with this guy.

The noise around me had not subsided, but my voice seemed to have reached them straightaway.

For a moment, he raised his eyebrows slightly in suspicion, but then immediately spoke with a calm air.

<blank>

You said, "...... Oh, you're that guy you were talking about in the carriage. I'm sorry, but I've taken care of most of the people who have been involved with me. To be honest, I'm not sure which one you are talking about. Kuhkuh."

<blank>

That means you are sure what you did with Mr. Miller.

You may say you don't remember, but your amused, squinty eyes don't say so.

<blank>

You didn't meet Mr. Miller by chance, did you? ...... who sent you?"

So I don't remember, miss."

Lawrence Niven, huh?"

<blank>

'Come on! Little bitch!"

<blank>

A large, dark-skinned man shouted angrily.

It is a loud voice filled with intimidation, as if the atmosphere is shaking.

Apparently, I did not like the way I saw it.

<blank>

You are finished here! Let the beast tear you to pieces and show you how to cry out in misery!

<blank>

Let's see, I'm thinking of Bagad, the head of the "Blue Fang" and Garey, the head of the "Abominable Serpent."

<blank>

The bandit style is Bagad and the old man is Garey.

When their names were called, they opened their eyes and stopped moving.

<blank>

The "Blue Viper" is the name used to refer to the "Blue Fang" and the "Abominable Serpent" as a whole, right? The rest are just a bunch of random bandits, right? ...... Oh, and there's a group of knight-errantry, too? And then there are ...... the knights of either country? Is this active? That's about three platoons, right?"

<blank>

"You ......! What are you talking about!

<blank>

I had heard that 'Gohl the Blue Snake' was not a public figure, but... I see, you ............ are going to 'shed your skin'."

Do it!

<blank>

Gohl the Blue Snake, a.k.a. "The Advisor," says in his lowest voice yet, "I've never seen anything like it.

<blank>

Suddenly three magical beasts came running toward me.

The way they crossed each other and switched positions as they came toward each other was truly a coordinated move.

<blank>

The three of them quickly closed the gap between us, and their claws and fangs, their weapons of choice, were constantly coming at me, trying to tear my body apart.

But, as a matter of course, I can't even snatch it from me.

<blank>

Oh, but did you just snatch a little bit of chocolate off the end of the ruffle at the hem of your skirt?

Ah! You ripped just a little bit! Konyaro ga!

<blank>

I was so miffed that I kicked the hexenbiest in the mandible, which caught its claws right there and then!

The chain attached to my leg popped and shredded without any resistance at that spur of the moment. Well, it was like it was attached, wasn't it?

<blank>

The sound of a large paper bag being smashed open echoed around the area, and the upper half of the beast's body popped like a water balloon.

Its lower body is blown away by the force of the bullet and flies to the front wall, spinning vertically at high speed.

The object, which was a demonic beast, hit the wall with such force that it turned into a stain on the wall on the spot, splattering the pieces of flesh that made up its body around the wall. Oooh, that's quite a splatter. It would have been fancier still if it had been extremely colorful!

<blank>

The people in the audience, who had been drenched in the wreckage of the magical beast from their heads, did not seem to understand what had just happened.

<blank>

What is "..................?"

<blank>

The three guys up there are looking dumbfounded and dumbfounded.

The arena, which had been noisy earlier, was quiet in the present instant.

But I don't think it's too early to be dumbfounded, do you?

<blank>

<blank>

At any rate, since you said you can't use magic with the manacle gimmick, let's give it a try.

<blank>

Now, by detonating one of the three magical beasts, the remaining two jumped back to the left and right, as if they had been instantly alerted.

Raise your hand and aim it at the one that jumped to its right.

<blank>

Fire Strike."

It's the original, self-explanatory, initial single-attack magic.

I've seen too many times when I've used this thing, and I've seen the pain it causes, so I don't forget to suppress the magical power that is caged inside!

Three fingers on the right. Gently stick out your thumb, index, and middle fingers and squeeze the magic power as if you were gently plucking a ping pong ball.

<blank>

A flame bullet of about five centimeters in diameter appeared at the tip of his finger as he had imagined, and the next moment it manifested, it landed on the magical beast.

The instantaneously heated air expands at once, blowing the body of the demonic beast to pieces with a roar that seems to gouge the earth.

<blank>

<blank>

I knew you could use magic as usual!

<blank>

The wall that was in the line of fire of the firebomb also blew away the entire spectator area, about five meters wide.

The walls have blown out to the outside and are completely airy.

I see about a dozen bandits who were in the audience and got caught in the middle of it. Some of them have got their arms and legs badly injured. ...... I guess I don't need to worry about it.

<blank>

<blank>

Okay, so what about the magic of the evergreen version?

Now imagine that you are plucking with your left thumb and forefinger, shortening the chant and chanting the magic name.

<blank>

Fire Bread

This time, a fireball the size of a pachinko ball manifested from the fingertip.

Hmm? I felt some fuzziness, but it doesn't interfere with the magic activation.

<blank>

The released fire bullet made a light popping sound and went straight toward the scaled jaguar, and was reduced to being sucked between its eyebrows.

The magical fire scorched its insides, and the demon beast, charred from the inside out, collapsed on the spot.

<blank>

<blank>

"I can use ......, but?"

<blank>

I can do magic, but what does that mean? I turned to Gohl on the dais and gave him the jitters.

<blank>

Perhaps this magical tool called a binding charm has the effect of interfering with the wearer's spirit seal and preventing the manifestation of magic.

But if you use magic beyond its capacity, that interference becomes meaningless.

It's like a small wave being swallowed by a big wave.

<blank>

I thought it was a meaningless item, so I twisted it a little to check the magic seal on it and found ....... This one cracked easily.

I knew it was fragile!

<blank>

"............ this, ...... what the hell is going on?!"

<blank>

Oh? Gohl's language is becoming dirty.

<blank>

We don't want to start with a sequential deployment of forces, you know."

<blank>

What?

<blank>

I say we came here to hit them with maximum force right from the start."

<blank>

What the ............ are you talking about?

<blank>

"Well, boys."

<blank>

Let your right hand fall a little to the side of your waist, bend that waist lightly, open your palm in front of your face while thrusting your left elbow out to the side, and stare at the podium from between your open fingers.

<blank>

Since when did ...... give us the illusion that we had a choice?"

<blank>

I even ended up posing in a savory way.



<blank>

----------------

Suzy, "I'm going to ......56 vinegar you."

Gohl: "What is this guy? This guy."

No self-destruction.
