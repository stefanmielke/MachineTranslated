# Episode 10: Meeting Suzy the Pig

"How are you feeling? Your face is completely pale."

"It's pretty bad... If I burn out like this, I'm going to take the day off."

"This is the first time I've seen you looking so unwell."

"It happens sometimes, you know? It seems like the accumulated fatigue comes out every few years... It hits my intestines... I get terrible diarrhea and fever, and I feel completely drained... At times like this, I just have to honestly go to bed..."

"Shall I try something?"

"What? What are you going to do?"

"No, I was thinking of injecting some 'ki'..."

"Huh? What is that? Is it going to change anything?"

"Well... It's my first time doing this, so I don't know how it will turn out... But I know that this is how it's done... Oh! Interesting. Your 'ki' color is starting to blend with mine."

"What? That's scary! Can you even see colors?"

"Yes, I can. Didn't I mention it? Yours is green, and mine is orange... Look, it's mostly blended! Now, you're the same color as me. How does it feel? Has anything changed?"

"Hmm? My body feels warm? Around my body? It feels like I'm in a bath... Oh, and my body seems to be moving? Yeah, it moves. Even though my body is broken and drained, it doesn't hurt to move normally... It's a strange feeling."

"Just because you can move doesn't mean you should push yourself. Your body isn't healed yet. Right now, it's just like you've added a reserve fuel tank. So just go home and rest."

"Wow, this feels really strange. I feel like I could run normally or even pull an all-nighter tonight!"

"Well, you might be able to do that. But if the reserve tank runs out, you'll collapse again! Right now, the right thing to do is to use that tank's contents for your body's recovery!"

"I understand. I'll honestly go home today."

"Also, before you rest, I think you should try incorporating the 'ki' of the earth that I taught you last time. You remember how to do it, right?"

"Yeah, I take it in from under my armpits, right? First, I loosen my chest and around my armpits, then I suck it in from under my armpits and store it in my chest, then I send it to my lower dantian to store it for a while."

"After that, please store the 'ki' in your bones. The femur is the thickest, so you can store as much as you want. Imagine the red 'ki' of magma making your femur glow red like molten iron. The red 'ki' warms your body and gives you vitality."

"Does the effect of 'ki' change depending on its color?"

"I don't know much about it yet, but it seems that pure 'ki' has no color. My master said that the 'ki' from the mountains is cold-colored and cools the body. He mentioned it's good for cooling the head, but if you inhale it carelessly, it can cool your core and cause intense pain like when you eat shaved ice, so be careful. Do you want to try it later?"

"I'm not trying it! I have confidence that I would die if I did it now!"

"If that happens, I'll try something different, so it'll be fine!"

"Ah! You! Do you think I'm some kind of test subject?! That's scary!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

That day's outfit was different from usual.

<b>

'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes'

It was a quest item for progressing the 'Errand Quest.'

<b>

In an event, it was a key item for carrying clothes from the village chief's house to his granddaughter's place as part of the 'Errand Quest.'

Since it had been forgotten during the quest progression, the item remained.

<b>

The 'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes' is a simple dress.

The neckline has a cut in the front to make it easier to put on.

<b>

It has a straight shape, and the skirt length is below the knee.

The sleeves are long enough to cover the elbows slightly.

The overall color is light yellow, with thick orange lines around the sleeves, skirt length, and neckline.

<b>

A long white belt wraps around the waist, tied on the right side, with the excess hanging down.

From just the silhouette, it resembles a Mongolian deel with short sleeves and length.

<b>

Thus, the current state has zero defense and attack power due to the equipment.

<b>

To an outsider, she looks like an ordinary village girl.

<b>

Additionally, she is not wearing anything underneath.

In other words, she is in a 'no underwear' state.

<b>

The reason is that she just washed them earlier.

<b>

Usually, she washes and hangs them up before bed.

After all, there are no replacements.

She gets dirty every day, so she has to wash them.

<b>

However, last night, she accidentally went to bed without washing.

<b>

The washed underwear is currently stored in her inventory.

She doesn't want to wear wet underwear.

But she also can't just leave them hanging and move on.

So, she plans to take them out and hang them somewhere suitable.

<b>

Well, she is enjoying her current state, so it's fine.

<b>

"This breezy feeling is amazing! There's nothing getting in the way while I run! The sense of liberation and anxiety that is different from men... Hmm... No bra makes my breasts jiggle nicely. And they rub against each other... If I move too much, it might become a bit troublesome."

<b>

What could be troublesome!

<b>

This time, she camped about 20 kilometers from the edge of the forest.

<b>

If she aims for human habitation, it would be safe to proceed along the river... So, she is heading south along the river from the waterfall.

<b>

With that mobility, she thinks it would be better to rush straight to human habitation, but she needs to prepare various things.

<b>

Especially mental preparation.

<b>

Controlling her combat power is also important.

If she accidentally turns the town into ruins... that would be absolutely bad.

The collapse of the mountain range has left quite a trauma.

<b>

After all, the original person inside is quite a coward.

<b>

She feels somewhat hesitant about communicating with the people of this unknown world in this body.

<b>

She truly longs for a human-like life, meals, food, and cooking... but for various reasons, she keeps putting it off.

<b>

<b>

Now, she is exploring her surroundings while slowly heading south.

<b>

"With this state, I shouldn't be able to attack with my armor. I should look for something suitable and try it out."

<b>

With a slightly cheerful demeanor, she even skipped along.

In a normal skirt, she felt like she was on a picnic.

<b>

Then, a small animal appeared ahead.

<b>

"Huh? A rabbit? It's a herbivore, but it seems to be coming this way? Alright! Welcome! I'll take on anyone's challenge!"

<b>

She closed the distance of about 10 meters with quick hops and jumped in from about 5 meters away.

With the speed of a cannonball, it hit Suzy's chest and bounced off.

<b>

"Whoa! That just bounced off! My chest just bounced! Whoa!"

<b>

What is so delightful about that?

<b>

The rebounding rabbit jumped again as soon as it landed.

It kept bouncing against her stomach, sides, waist, back, and butt, but each time it did, it dealt zero damage.

<b>

(Is it really a level difference? I shouldn't have done anything...)

<b>

Suddenly, a loud popping sound echoed around her side.

<b>

"Huh! Damage? Oh, it healed instantly. Was that damage 1? Still, it's my first experience! My first damage!"

<b>

The fabric from under her chest to her side ripped, exposing that part of her skin.

<b>

"Did a critical hit occur? A critical hit with damage 1 means there's a significant level difference... But still, to trigger a critical hit with that level difference, how high is this rabbit's critical rate?!"

<b>

She targeted the rabbit again.

<b>

"'Snuff Rabbit'? A head-hunting rabbit?! Oh! This one! Now that I look closely, its front teeth are terrifyingly long! Is it aiming for the carotid artery and trying to take my head off with a critical hit?! What a dangerous creature!"

<b>

If it were a normal human, there would be a good chance of having their head taken off the moment they encountered it...

It may not be strong, but it is quite a troublesome opponent.

<b>

"You’re dangerous! Take that!"

<b>

She delivered a light chop to the front of the flying rabbit.

The rabbit was slammed into the ground and became a stain on the earth.

<b>

"Hmm, it looked like just an ordinary white wild rabbit, but it was a vicious one. It must be called 'White Devil' by the locals!"

<b>

With a name like 'the white devil' attached to it...

<b>

She unconsciously gave it a nickname.

<b>

"Ah, my clothes ripped... Is this also my first experience of damage to my equipment? By the way... can you see my sideboob? Is it a bit sexy?"

<b>

She slipped her fingers into the tear and explored inside.

<b>

"...Oh, I accidentally touched the tip... Hmm... Oh, that felt a bit nice... Hehe."

<b>

That's not a 'heh'! There's no wavering in situations like this.

<b>

Then, she noticed several mobs approaching her.

<b>

(Three? Are they moving together? ...Is that a small group? A pack?)

<b>

After a while, their figures became visible through the trees.

<b>

Bipedal humanoids.

They were wrapped in filthy leather or cloth around their waists, each holding a rusty sword, an awkward club, or a weapon resembling a large, chipped axe.

<b>

Their skin appeared white and flabby.

Their faces were just like pigs.

Moreover, they had the mean, villainous faces of pigs.

They were about 160 centimeters tall, not very large.

<b>

"Orcs. They look completely different from the orcs I know. This world is indeed different..."

<b>

She muttered somewhat ennui.

<b>

On the other hand, the orcs approached excitedly, sniffing the air with their noses twitching.

<b>

Eventually, it seemed they caught the scent and noticed Suzy.

<b>

"What! What are these guys?! They're staring at me with such intense nostrils?! What are they excited about... Whoa! Why is the front of their loincloth bulging?! Don't point at me! Ugh! They're thrusting their hips!! Oh no! There's a stain spreading in their groin! Ugh! They're coming this way!! Don't come near! There's no gap for you to insert that thing!!"

<b>

In a panic, she turned her legs inward and held her groin over her skirt, shouting.

<b>

The orcs had bloodshot eyes, breathing heavily, and drooling as they charged at her with tremendous force.

<b>

"Don't come near, you bastards! Burn!!"

<b>

≪Fire Strike≫

A skill of the Arc Wizard.

An initial fire-type magic for single-target attacks.

<b>

From Suzy's outstretched palm, a fireball the size of a baseball was launched.

The fireball sank into the chest of the leading orc as if it were being sucked in.

The orc was instantly engulfed in flames.

Although it was a single-target attack magic, the flames that enveloped one orc also burned the two others nearby to ashes.

<b>

"May you become char siu!"

<b>

With her hands on her hips, she glared at the three charred remains.

<b>

"But seriously! What are these guys? Are they the embodiment of lust?! This is outrageous!! They caught the scent of a woman and came straight here?! They seem to be nothing but a presence that thinks of nothing but doing it! I feel a mix of disgust and danger rising from my groin! Is this a sensation that only comes from being a woman? It's a tingling, first-time sensation! A maiden's crisis?!"

<b>

She hugged her shoulders and shivered slightly.

<b>

"These guys are no good! Their very existence is an enemy to women! Pig slaughter at first sight! I'll crush them without question upon sight!!"

<b>

With a slightly pale face, she clenched her fists.

<b>

"Wait! Could there be others nearby?!"

<b>

She looked up and began to scan the area.

<b>

"They came from over there..."

<b>

Saying that, she kicked the ground and jumped into the air to get a better view.

From above, she could see that about two kilometers southeast from her position, the trees broke, revealing an open space.

<b>

"That's it. There's a gathering of presences over there. It feels really bad! There's no doubt it's coming from there."

<b>

As she began to descend while glaring at that location, she made sure her skirt wouldn't fly up during her descent, as is the etiquette of a maiden.

After all, she was currently in a 'no underwear' state!

Upon landing, she ran straight toward the place where she instinctively felt disgust.

<b>

<b>

<b>

That place was indeed a settlement.

A depression about 100 meters in diameter.

It was slightly sunken from the surroundings, with a small cliff rising to the east, forming a wall-like enclosure.

<b>

To the north was a mountain, and on this side, the cliff had exposed rock faces as if it had been carved away.

In front of that was a stage slightly higher than the others.

<b>

In the square, tents of various sizes and simple huts were built.

Scattered about were suspicious bones and various animal remains, both upper and lower halves, displayed or hung haphazardly, giving a sense of life.

<b>

On the stage in front of the northern cliff stood a hut that seemed somewhat better than the others, with many decorations around it.

That was likely where the leader of the settlement was.

<b>

In this place, over 200 orcs were writhing about, taking up every inch of space.

<b>

Suzy stood at the western edge of the settlement, staring intently at a point on the eastern side.

<b>

The eastern cliff was about 2 meters high.

There was a part near the north of that cliff that was indented as if it had been gouged out.

There, a simple hut was built, covered with a makeshift roof and open at the front.

<b>

Inside that hut, something was writhing slightly.

Suzy fixed her sharp gaze on it.

<b>

Suzy then jumped from her current position, landing right in front of the hut from above.

<b>

As Suzy landed with the force of the earth, a shockwave spread around her.

The nearby orcs were blown away by the shockwave.

<b>

The orcs that remained unscathed were startled by the impact, and many were bewildered, but they quickly noticed the woman who had suddenly appeared and became excited.

Why did she suddenly appear? The orcs lacked the intelligence to ponder such questions.

<b>

What mattered was that there was a healthy, fully usable female right in front of them!

<b>

The orcs became agitated by the scent of a woman.

In the orcs' minds, there was nothing but the thought of mating with the woman before them.

<b>

The orcs, with lustful expressions, lunged at Suzy one after another.

But Suzy, still glaring at the hut, swung her left arm vigorously as if to brush them off.

Once again, a shockwave spread from that spot, sweeping away the lunging orcs.

<b>

<b>

Inside the hut, two orcs were engaged in some activity, moving continuously.

<b>

They were likely once human beings.

How long had it been since they had perished? Had they undergone some processing? They showed no signs of decay.

But they had already begun to mummify.

<b>

Their eye sockets were wide open, and their skin barely clung to their bones.

A metal collar was fastened around their necks, chained to an iron stake driven into the ground.

<b>

The orcs were continuously thrusting themselves into such beings.

<b>

The one in front that had been moving noticed Suzy and widened its eyes.

As it looked over Suzy's body from top to bottom, its movements became faster and more intense.

<b>

And, drooling, it opened its eyes wide...

<b>

Suzy felt her mind going blank with rage.

<b>

"…You rotten piece of shit!!!"

<b>

Suzy furrowed her brow fiercely and spat out the words as if squeezing them from the depths of her belly.

At the same time, the upper body of the orc exploded as if it had been detonated.

<b>

The other orc, surprised by the explosion and the splattering of brain matter from the orc next to it, froze in place.

Immediately after, Suzy appeared before the headless orc and kicked its body away.

The motionless orc collided with the headless body, and both were sent flying off the cliff, crashing down and leaving an ugly stain on the wall.

<b>

<b>

Outside, the orc king, the leader of the settlement, had also rushed out, having caught the scent of Suzy.

<b>

Its physique was larger than the other orcs by more than a head.

It stood over 2 meters tall.

Muscular and powerful, it was incomparable to the other pigs.

<b>

It charged straight at Suzy.

The orcs in its path were all knocked away.

<b>

With a powerful leap, it landed near the hut.

The other orcs present were trampled, clearing the area.

<b>

The king, drooling and grinning, presented its aroused self before Suzy, who had just emerged from the hut.

<b>

Suzy deepened the furrow in her brow.

<b>

"You filthy creature! Don't expose your stinking filth in front of others!!"

<b>

She spat, instantly equipping her dual swords.

<b>

"Shatter!!!"

<b>

≪Final Sonic Breaker≫

A skill of the Duel Barbarian that unleashes a series of attacks that exceed the speed of sound with dual weapons charged with sword energy.

<b>

In an instant, multiple sword tips were thrust out.

However, before the first strike even made contact, the orc king's body had already exploded.

But the skill did not stop.

The shockwave generated by that sword technique carved out the earth, blowing away the surrounding orcs and even the northern cliff and mountain.

<b>

Half of the settlement was reduced to rubble in an instant.

<b>

In the face of this sudden storm-like event, some were left dumbfounded and frozen, while others panicked and fled in all directions, with over 100 orcs in a state of chaos.

<b>

As she glared coldly at the orcs, Suzy roared.

<b>

"Filthy insects, stop scurrying around!!!"

<b>

With a leap, she landed in the center of the horde and activated her magic.

<b>

"Burn to ashes!!!"

<b>

≪Flame Tornado≫

An area-of-effect fire attack skill of the Arc Wizard that spreads flames in a wide circle around herself.

<b>

Flames swirled and spread throughout the settlement.

The orcs engulfed in the ultra-high-temperature flames turned to charcoal in an instant, unable to escape or even scream.

<b>

The massive amount of heated air rose into the sky, causing winds to blow into the square.

The wind carried away the ash, erasing all traces of the settlement.

<b>

It all happened within just 1 to 2 minutes after Suzy arrived in this depression.

<b>

<b>

After confirming that the traces of the orcs had vanished from the depression, Suzy began to walk away.

<b>

She returned to the very spot where she first landed.

There, it seemed as if the flames had avoided that place, leaving no traces of fire.

<b>

The hut remained as it was.

<b>

Suzy knelt beside one of the mummified corpses.

She crushed the iron collar that had chained it with her fingertips and gently brushed aside the disheveled hair that covered the face of what had once been a woman.

<b>

"I'm sorry... If I could have arrived sooner... No, if I could have come before you were brought to such a place... You must have been scared, you must have hated it, you must have regretted it... I'm sorry, but it's okay now, you're no longer here... I'm going to take you outside now..."

<b>

Tears flowed uncontrollably.

For some reason, she felt sad and regretful, and tears streamed down her face, falling one after another.

While crying, she gently lifted the corpse and took it to the center of the depression.

<b>

Inside the hut, there were three mummified bodies.

In addition, there were several human bones scattered about, which she gathered and neatly arranged in the center of the depression.

<b>

"I'm sorry, but this is the only way I can clean you up..."

<b>

Saying that, she spread her arms wide and used magic to ignite flames over the bodies.

<b>

She felt like she was starting to understand how to control the flames a little.

Just like when handling 'ki,' she poured her image into the flames from her palms.

Gently and purely, she infused the flames with the pure white 'ki' rising from the earth to purify the impurities.

<b>

Eventually, all the bodies turned into white, beautiful ash.

Suzy knelt beside them, scooped up the ash with both hands, and raised it high to the wind.

<b>

"You don't want to sleep in a place like this, do you? I hope you can return to your family..."

<b>

She continued to pray as she entrusted the ash to the wind, scoop by scoop, until there was none left.

The prologue will conclude in the next episode. It's the epilogue.
