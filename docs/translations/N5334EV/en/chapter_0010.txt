# 10 Meet Suzy Pig

How are you feeling?　You look pale.

"It's bad indeed. ....... I'm going to bake this and then I'm out of here for the day."

I've never seen a senior look so sick."

"It happens sometimes, it's like the exhaustion that builds up over the years comes out of me. ...... It comes to my intestines,...... and I'm left helter-skelter with terrible diarrhea and fever,...... and in times like this, I just have to go to bed honestly."

Let's give it a try: ......"

What? What are you doing?"

"No, I'm thinking of injecting 'Ki' into ......."

What's that?　What's that?　Does that change anything?"

"Well, I've never ...... done this before, so I don't know what's going to ...... happen, but I know what to do. ......　Interesting. The color of your senpai's "Ki" is turning into my color.

What?　What's so scary?　I mean, can you see any colors?"

Yes, I did. Didn't I tell you?　My senior's is green and mine is orange...see, it's mostly dyed!　Now they're the same color as mine. What do you think?　Any change?"

Hmm?　Something warm around the body?　Around that body?　It's warm like you're taking a bath... oh, and something about your body moves?　Unh, it moves. My body is still broken and exhausted... but it's not hard to move normally... which is kind of weird."

Don't push yourself just because you can move. Your body is not healed. I just put a spare fuel tank on it. Please go home and take a rest.

It's really a strange feeling. I feel like I could run like a normal person or even stay up all night tonight!

Well, you can do what you can do," he said. If the reserve tank runs out, you will collapse again! The right thing to do now is to use the contents of that tank to repair your body!"

I know. I'm honestly going home today.

"Also, before you take a break, I think you should try and see if you can incorporate the "Ki" of the earth that I taught you the other day. You remember how to do that, don't you?"

"Oh, you take it in from the armpits, right? "Yes, you take it in from under the armpits, and then you send it immediately to the lower tanten and let it accumulate.

Then store the ch'i in the bones. The femur is the thickest bone in the body, so you can store as much as you want. The femur should become red like a burnt iron by taking in the magma's red ch'i. The red ch'i will warm you and give you vitality. The red Ki will warm your body and give you vitality.

Does chi have different effects depending on its color?"

I don't know much about it, but I've heard that pure Ki has no color. My teacher told me that the ch'i of the mountains, contrary to that of the earth, is cold and cools the body. He said it is good for cooling your head, but if you inhale it unprotected, it will cool your core and make it hurt like when you eat shaved ice, so be careful. Would you like to try it later, senpai?"

I won't try it!　I'm sure I'd die if I tried it now!"

I'll try something else then, okay?"

Oh!　You!　You think I'm some kind of lab rat or something?　You're scary!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The equipment that day was different from the usual.

<blank>

The village girl's everyday clothes.

This is a query item to advance the "errand query".

<blank>

It was a key item in the "Errand Quay" event, where the clothes were carried from the village chief's house to his granddaughter's place.

The items were left behind because they were forgotten when the quest stopped in the middle of its progress.

<blank>

The "village girl's everyday clothes" is a simple one-piece dress.

The neck area has a slit in the front for easy opening to put the head in.

<blank>

It is stoned and the skirt length is below the knee.

The length of the sleeves also hides the elbows a little.

The overall color is light yellow with thick lines around the sleeves, around the length of the skirt, and around the neck dyed orange.

<blank>

It is wrapped around the waist with a long white sash, stopped at the right side, and the excess portion is dropped directly down.

The silhouette alone is similar to a Mongolian dale with short sleeves and length.

<blank>

So the current state is zero defense and zero attack with the equipment.

<blank>

From the outside, she is a perfectly normal village girl.

<blank>

And by the way, I'm not wearing anything inside.

In other words, it's a 'high tenor' situation.

<blank>

Because I just washed them a while ago.

<blank>

I usually wash and dry them before bedtime.

After all, there is no replacement.

After all, we can't afford not to wash them because they get dirty in various ways every day.

<blank>

However, last night I ended up going to bed without washing it.

<blank>

The washed underwear is now stored in the inventory.

I don't want to wear wet underwear.

But we can't just leave them hanging out to dry and move on.

So, I am planning to take it out and dry it somewhere appropriate.

<blank>

Well, it is good that he is enjoying his current state.

<blank>

　There's nothing to get in my way when I run!　The sense of freedom and uneasiness that is different from men's is also ....... I can't help but feel a sense of freedom and uneasiness that's different from men. It rubs against my tits and if I move too much,......, I might get in trouble.

<blank>

What is the trouble?

<blank>

This time, we camped just 20 kilometers from the edge of the forest.

<blank>

If you are going to reach a human village, you can be sure to follow the river ......, and from the waterfall, you are heading south along the river.

<blank>

If you have that mobility, you might want to get out to the human village at once, but a lot of preparation is needed.

<blank>

Especially mental preparation and so on.

<blank>

It's like controlling combat power and so on.

It's definitely not a good idea to go wrong and leave the city in ruins .......

The collapse of the mountain range has been quite traumatic.

<blank>

After all, the original person in the room was pretty jumpy.

<blank>

He is also somewhat nervous about suddenly communicating with people from a world he doesn't know, using this body.

<blank>

The truth is that I am longing for a human-like life, food, food and cooking ...... as soon as possible, but I am putting it off for various reasons.

<blank>

<blank>

Now we are exploring the surroundings and bobbing our way south.

<blank>

I'm sure that in this condition, the armor won't attack me. I'll find something suitable and give it a try.

<blank>

He seemed to be in a bit of a good mood without a care in the world and was even skipping.

She looks like a picnic in a regular skirt.

<blank>

And then a small animal appeared ahead.

<blank>

"Hmm?　A rabbit?　You're a herbivore, but you're coming at me, aren't you?　All right!　Come on in!　I'll accept anyone's challenge!"

<blank>

He shortened the distance to about 10 meters ton ton ton ton, and then jumped in at once from around 5 meters.

It is as fast as a cannonball, but it hits Suzy in the chest and bounces back with a pop.

<blank>

"Oh my gosh!　My chest just popped!　My chest just popped!　Oh, my chest just popped!

<blank>

What makes you so happy?

<blank>

The bounced rabbit comes leaping again as soon as it lands.

They come at you every time you play them in the stomach, sides, waist, back, and buttocks, but they do zero damage in every case.

<blank>

(Is it the difference in level?　I didn't do anything.)

<blank>

And suddenly, a popping sound echoed around my side.

<blank>

Mhm!　Damage?　Oh, it healed in an instant. Damage 1?　Still. My first time!　My first time with damage!

<blank>

Her clothes are ripped from under her breasts to her armpits, revealing skin in that area.

<blank>

'Did this one get a critical?　There's a significant level difference between a crit and a bad one. ...... But how high is the crit rate to generate a crit with that level difference?　How high is this guy?"

<blank>

Once again, I'm going to try to tag a rabbit.

<blank>

A "snuff-rabbit"?　You mean a head-hunting rabbit!　Ah!　This guy!　If you look closely, you can see its long front teeth!　You're going to use this to aim for the carotid artery and decapitate it with a critical hit?　That's a bad guy!

<blank>

If you were a normal human being, it is quite possible that you would have been decapitated the moment you encountered them....

They are not strong, but they are quite troublesome opponents.

<blank>

You're so stupid!　Teiii!"

<blank>

He took a light chop to the front of the flying Rabbit.

Rabbit was knocked straight to the ground and became a stain on the ground.

<blank>

He looked like a white rabbit, but he was a vicious one. The locals must have called him the 'White Devil' or something like that!

<blank>

It's headed, federally, or something like that, and is available at .......

<blank>

I took the liberty of giving it two names.

<blank>

Oh, I ripped my clothes. ...... Is this the first time I've experienced damage to my equipment? But still ...... can you see my side boobs from the sides?　Is it a little bit too much?"

<blank>

He puts his fingers in the side crevices and explores inside.

<blank>

"......Ah, I touched the tip. ......Nyu. ......Ah, a little bit of Jun came. ...... Tehe."

<blank>

It's not tehe!　There is no blurring in these places.

<blank>

<blank>

I noticed a few mobs coming toward us.

<blank>

(Three of them?　Are they working together?　...... Not many for a herd?　(Groups?)

<blank>

After a while, those guys came into view through the trees.

<blank>

Bipedal humanoid type.

Wrapped around his waist was a dirty leather or cloth-like cloth, and in each hand he held a rusty sword, a misshapen club, and an axe-like weapon with a large chipped blade.

<blank>

The skin looks white and buoyant.

The face is that of a pig itself.

And he's an evil-looking pig with a bad eye.

He is about 160 cm tall, or not so big.

<blank>

Orcs. It's totally different from the orcs I know. I knew the world was different. ......"

<blank>

He mumbles a little ennui.

<blank>

The orcs, on the other hand, seemed excited and came closer, their noses twitching as they sniffed.

<blank>

Eventually, the orcs noticed Suzy, perhaps because they could smell her.

<blank>

Hey! What! They're snickering and staring at me! They are snickering and staring at me! What are they so excited about? Why is the front of the loin cloth so puffed up? Don't point at me! I'm not pointing at you! I've been looking for a way to get a little more privacy! Oh, my crotch is spreading! Ahh..! He's coming towards me! Don't come! Stop coming! There's no room for that thing!

<blank>

As quickly as I could, I turned inward and held my crotch over my skirt and screamed.

<blank>

The orcs came charging at us furiously, bloodshot-eyed, huffing and puffing, and spraying drool.

<blank>

Don't come here, you son of a bitch!　Burn!

<blank>

≪Fire Strike.

Arc Wizard Skills.

It's a flame-based initial magic for single attacks.

<blank>

A ball of flame the size of a baseball was shot from Susie's palm, which was thrust forward.

The mass of flame was reduced to the chest of the orc that was rushing forward at the head of the pack, as if sucked in.

The orcs were instantly engulfed in flames.

Although this magic is designed for a single attack, the flames that engulfed one body also engulfed and consumed the two bodies around it.

<blank>

"I'll be a pork chops!"

<blank>

Glaring at the three lumps of charcoal with his hands on his hips with a hmmm.

<blank>

I'm not sure! What are these guys? Are they the rightful owners of sexual desires? What a bunch of idiots! They smell a woman's scent and come straight for her? They don't think about anything but what they're going to do, do they? I felt a mixture of disgust and a sense of danger coming up from between my legs! Is it because it's a woman's body that I'm feeling this way? It's the first time I've ever had that feeling! I'm having a girl's crisis!

<blank>

He held his own shoulder and shook himself in a burr.

<blank>

They're no good!　Their very existence is already an enemy of women!　Slay the pigs immediately!　As soon as I find them, I'll crush them without question!

<blank>

He clenched his fists with a slightly bloodshot complexion.

<blank>

Ha!　Don't tell me there are still others nearby?

<blank>

Mhmm..." I look up and search around! I looked up and explored the area.

<blank>

They're from over there. ......

<blank>

With that, he leapt into the air, kicking the ground with a thud to get a better look at his surroundings.

From the air, we could see that about 2 km southeast of the site, the trees had broken off and there was a space.

<blank>

There it is. There's a lot of signs gathering over there. It feels really bad!　It's definitely coming from there.

<blank>

The fall begins as you stare at the spot.

It is a maiden's prerogative to be careful not to roll up her skirt while falling.

After all, they are "high tenor" now!

When he landed, he started running in a straight line to that instinctive place of disgust.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The place was still a village.

It is a depression about 100 meters in diameter.

It was slightly sunken in from its surroundings, so that the small cliff to the east, or across the street, loomed up and became like a wall around it.

<blank>

To the north is a mountain, and on this side is a cliff with a rocky surface that looks as if it has been chipped away.

In front of it is a stage that is one level higher than the others.

<blank>

Tents of various sizes and simple huts were erected in the plaza.

Here and there, suspicious-looking bones and the lower and upper halves of animals were hung up in disorder, giving the place a lived-in feel.

<blank>

The hut standing on the stage in front of the cliff on the north side is somewhat better than the others, and there seems to be more decorations of some kind around the hut.

Perhaps that is where the head of the village is.

<blank>

There were more than 200 orcs, in number, writhing about in this place.

<blank>

Suzy stands on the western edge of the settlement, staring at a point to the east.

<blank>

Cliff on the east side, about 2 meters high.

Near the north of that cliff, there is an indented area where part of the cliff is gouged out.

A simple shed had been built there, covered with simple columns and a roof, with an open front.

<blank>

Something stirs in its shed in small increments.

Suzy glared at it with a sharp gaze.

<blank>

Suzy slowly leapt from where she was standing and landed in front of the hut at once from the sky above.

<blank>

A shockwave spreads around Suzy as she lands on the ground.

The shockwave engulfed the orcs nearby and blew them away.

<blank>

Many of the orcs were surprised and dismayed by the shock, but they immediately noticed the woman who had suddenly appeared there and became excited.

Why did it suddenly appear? Orcs do not have the intelligence to ask such questions.

<blank>

The only thing that matters is that I have a healthy and fully functioning bitch in front of me right now!　The only thing that matters is that we have a healthy, usable female in front of us right now!

<blank>

At the scent of the woman, the orcs all at once became furious.

The only thing on the orcs' minds at the moment is to seed the woman in front of them.

<blank>

The orcs, full of lust, jumped on Suzy from one side to the other.

But Suzy, glaring at the hut and looking depressed, swung her left arm out vigorously as if to shake it off.

Once again, a shockwave spreads around the spot, uprooting the orcs that leap at it.

<blank>

<blank>

Inside the hut, two orcs were attached to something and were constantly moving.

<blank>

It is probably a being that was once human.

How much time has passed since the incident?　I wondered how long it had been since they were destroyed, and whether they had undergone any kind of treatment.

But already the Kinoyization has begun.

<blank>

The eye sockets are wide open and the skin is barely attached to the bone.

An iron collar is attached to its neck, and a thick chain ties it to an iron stake propped up against the ground.

<blank>

Oak continues to thrust itself against such opponents.

<blank>

One of the front ones, which was moving itself, noticed Suzy and looked at her.

He looks around Susie's body from top to bottom as if licking it, his movements increasing in speed and intensity.

<blank>

Then, he opened his eyes, drooling, and went to ..........

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy's mind seemed to go blank with indignation.

<blank>

"............ kon!　You rotten piece of shit!

<blank>

Suzy wrinkled her brow furiously and spat out the words as if squeezed from the depths of her heart.

At the same time, the orc's chest and above suddenly blew up like an explosion.

<blank>

The other orc also stopped moving, startled by the fact that the orc next to him had been blown away, splattering brain plasma.

Immediately thereafter, Suzy appeared in front of the headless orc and kicked its body away.

The headless body slammed into the orc that had stopped moving, sending both of them flying to the cliff, where they were crushed, creating an ugly stain on the wall.

<blank>

<blank>

Outside, the Oak King, the chief of this community, had also come running out upon smelling Suzy.

<blank>

Its stature is more than one size larger than that of other orcs.

He is over two meters tall.

Their muscularity and strength are unmatched by other pigs.

<blank>

This guy rushes toward Suzy at once.

All the orcs on the king's running line were blown away.

<blank>

He took a big leap of momentum and landed near the hut.

The other orcs present were trampled and vacated the spot.

<blank>

Drooling and contorting his face in glee, the king thrust his erect self in front of Suzy as he emerged from the hut.

<blank>

Suzy's furrowed brow deepened further.

<blank>

"...... rot!　Don't expose your stinking filth to the public!"

<blank>

He spits out, "I'm not going to do it," and instantly equips D two swords.

<blank>

Smash it!

<blank>

≪'Final sonic breaker'.

A two-bladed weapon with a pool of sword chi unleashes a series of attacks that transcend the speed of sound.

Dueling barbarian melee attack maximum skill.

<blank>

Instantly, the tip of the sword was thrust out in several stripes.

But before the first blow...before the first sword tip touched, the Oak King's body had already been obliterated.

But the skills don't stop there.

The shockwave created by his swordsmanship chipped away at the surrounding orcs and blew away the cliffs to the north as well as the mountain itself.

<blank>

Fifty percent of the village was reduced to rubble in an instant.

<blank>

Some were stunned by the sudden storm-like event and did not move an inch. Others were dismayed and fled to the right and left, and still more than 100 orcs were panicking.

<blank>

Suzy barked as she glared coldly at these orcs.

<blank>

Stop you dung beetles from littering the place!

<blank>

With one leap, he landed in the center of the herd and activated his magic.

<blank>

Burn, damn you!!!!!!!"

<blank>

≪Flame Tornado.

Arc Wizard's flame-based ranged attack skill that spreads a wide circle of flame around you.

<blank>

At once the flames swirl and spread throughout the village.

The orcs, engulfed in superheated flames, were instantly carbonized and crushed before they could escape or even let out a scream.

<blank>

The large volume of air heated by the hot flames rose into the air, bringing winds from the surrounding area into the plaza.

The wind carries away the ashes that have been burned away, erasing any trace that there was ever a settlement on the land.

<blank>

It happened only a minute or two after Suzy arrived at this depression.

<blank>

<blank>

After looking around and making sure that all traces of orcs were disappearing from the hollow, Suzy started to walk away.

<blank>

Go to the first place you landed.

There are no traces of flames in the area, as if the flames had only avoided that area.

<blank>

The hut remained intact.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy went inside and kneeled beside one of the Kinoyiized bodies.

<blank>

He breaks the iron collar that holds her chain with his fingertips, and gently pulls the sparse hair from her once-feminine face with his fingertips.

<blank>

"......I'm sorry ....... If you could have come earlier,...... no, before they brought you to this place,...... you would have been scared, you would have hated it, you would have been frustrated.... ...I'm sorry, but it's okay, I'm not here anymore,...... so I'm going to let you out now,......"

<blank>

I couldn't stop crying.

For some reason, I became sad, frustrated, and tears started to spill over and spill over and spill over later and later.

He gently picked up the crying body and took him to the center of the hollow.

<blank>

Inside the hut, there were three Kinonized bodies.

<blank>

In addition, there were several other objects that looked like human bones lying randomly, so we collected them all and arranged them neatly in the center of the depression.

<blank>

Sorry, this is the only way I can clean it up for you. ......

<blank>

After saying this, he spreads his arms wide and magically lights a flame over the corpse.

<blank>

I thought I was beginning to understand how to control the flames a little better.

Just as when dealing with Ki, the image is poured from the palm facing the flame.

A gentle, pure flame, filled with the pure, white, silver "Ki" that rises from the earth to purify the impurities.

<blank>

Eventually, all the bodies are reduced to clean white ashes.

Susie kneeled beside him, scooped up the ashes with both hands, and held them high in the air.

<blank>

'Wouldn't want to sleep in a place like this, would you?　Hopefully, you can go home to your family: ......"

<blank>

Scoop by scoop, scoop by scoop, I continued to pray and leave the ashes to the wind until they were gone.

The next installment will conclude the introduction. Epilogue.
