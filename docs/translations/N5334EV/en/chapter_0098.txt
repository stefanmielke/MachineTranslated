# Chapter 86: Nostalgic Reunion

The dorm room was much larger than I had expected.

<b>

The large window on the south side flooded the room with sunlight.

The wind from outside blew in through the open window, gently swaying the sunshade curtains.

The breeze that wafted through the room carried the scent of the trees on the premises, making it very pleasant.

<b>

Inside the room, there were two dressers, two desks, two bookshelves, and two beds placed along the left and right walls.

The space between the beds was quite wide. I think it’s more than 2 meters apart?

All the furniture in the room was simple and unpretentious, but it had a very harmonious and chic design.

<b>

As I looked at the layout of the room, I walked to the center and sat down on one of the beds.

The cushion felt good as I sank into it.

Without thinking, I collapsed my upper body onto the bed.

Yeah, this bed is definitely comfortable to sleep on.

With my arms spread wide, lying on my back, I became convinced that I wouldn’t have to worry about sleep during my dorm life.

After all, the comfort of the bed is a great relief when starting a new life.

<b>

<b>

To be honest, I’m quite nervous about having to live with a stranger in the same room.

If it were someone from my hometown, like Bibi or Mia, it might be different, but apparently, this person has no connection to Amukamu at all!

I can’t help but be anxious about this, can I?

<b>

Separated from Sonia Mama and Howard Papa, just the thought of living alone far away makes me feel extremely lonely inside...

The only consolation is that Anna Mary came with me.

Just having Anna Mary by my side gives me so much reassurance right now!

I’m truly grateful to Sonia Mama for making Anna Mary my maid!

But still, that doesn’t mean all my anxiety disappears completely.

I can only hope that the roommate who hasn’t arrived yet is a cute and nice person——… that’s what I sincerely wish for now.

<b>

<b>

Well then, if Anna Mary sees me sprawled out like this on the bed, she might scold me for being improper!

But it can’t be helped, right? I’m tired from the long journey!

It’s been a while since I could lie down like this during the day, and this feeling of freedom is nice.

The carriage was much more comfortable than I expected, but still! Being in a carriage for almost an entire day is exhausting.

However… the most tiring part was definitely the last lucky incident that happened!!

<b>

Why did it have to happen at this timing?!

At the very end of this journey!

No! Was it the first step of my new life?!

Or does such a thing happen at a time like this?!

Ugh~~~! Just thinking about it makes my face heat up again!

No! Stop it! I’m finally enjoying the comfort of the bed! I need to change my thoughts quickly!!

<b>

Oh right! Even if the bed is nice, I still need a proper pillow!

I opened my bag and took out my beloved pillow.

I placed it on the bed, hugged it, and threw my body back onto the bed again.

<b>

Mmm, this is it. Now I can sleep soundly...

Burying my face in the pillow and taking a deep breath, I felt more and more at ease, as if I were in my own room in Amukamu.

Ah, I guess I was quite nervous about starting this new life after all.

Feeling my body relax, I became aware of that fact again.

<b>

Alright! Let’s quickly organize my space and make it feel like my own!

Shaking off the desire to sink deeper into the pillow, I decided to take out my belongings from the bag and start organizing my room.

<b>

The next thing I pulled out from the bag was a fluffy brown lump.

Yes! This is the Brown Crawler plushie!

The plush is over 50 centimeters tall and is quite realistic in size, but its fluffy texture makes it look adorable.

After all, this is the masterpiece of Fiorina, who is skilled at sewing!!

<b>

The Brown Crawler is a magical beast, but it’s popular among children. After all, it’s a source of pocket money for them!

Once, when the topic of whether I liked the Brown Crawler came up, I said I liked it, and Fiorina remembered that and gifted it to me this winter.

Since then, this little one has been my companion on my bed. I can’t sleep without it!

<b>

Then, I pulled out another plushie.

This one is a slightly misshapen Jackalope plushie, small enough to fit in my palm.

This one was actually made for me by that rascal, Stefan!!

<b>

Stefan, the mischievous boy, is probably the fastest in the village.

He has always been a troublemaker, slipping away from upperclassmen and adults, and running around nimbly.

Because of this, Stefan’s shirts and pants were always getting caught on something and tearing.

It’s not that the Jing family was poor! It’s just that Stefan’s mother couldn’t keep up with his destructive speed in mending his clothes.

One day, after being caught by his frustrated mother, Stefan was made to repair his own clothes instead of receiving a lecture or punishment.

At first, he was reluctant, but with his mother teaching him closely, whether he had a knack for it or not, Stefan quickly improved his sewing skills.

This surprised Stefan’s mother greatly. Well, Stefan was always quite handy!

<b>

One day, Stefan brought a patchwork cushion he made for himself to school.

When I learned that it was his creation and was impressed by its quality, I suggested that he could make plushies too, which led him to start making them.

After several prototypes, he finally completed this Jackalope plushie and gifted it to me.

Whenever I see it, I can see Stefan’s effort, and I’ve cherished it ever since.

<b>

After learning to sew, it seems Stefan’s mischief has calmed down a bit.

Even so! He still targets my skirt lifting, just like before!

Of course! There’s no way I would give him an opening to do that! Hehe!!

<b>

…That’s right. I have no openings! I shouldn’t have any openings!!

Yet! Why do I keep falling victim to lucky incidents?! Why does something like that happen?! Ah! No, no! My thoughts are wandering again… Stay calm, stay calm! Change my mindset!!

<b>

For now, I’ll keep pulling things out of my bag!

My favorite cushions. Hairbrush and mirror. My beloved books and various small containers.

I took them out one after another, filling the room with my belongings.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Despite the size of the bag, it holds quite a lot, but that’s because it has a magic similar to the carriage we rode to compress space.

I said similar, but the volume ratio is quite different.

The magic in the carriage expanded its volume to about 1.5 times the original. In contrast, the volume of this bag is about five times larger.

This difference is due to the supply of magical power.

<b>

The magic seal engraved on the carriage frame automatically absorbs a small amount of magical power from the mana flowing in the atmosphere or from the underground ley lines, allowing the magic to continue operating without the user needing to supply magical power. This is called “Mana Assist.”

<b>

On the other hand, the bag also has a magic seal engraved on its frame, allowing the magic to keep operating, but the magical power is supplied by a “magical power battery.”

When the magical power in the “magical power battery” runs out, it needs to be replaced, but it can consistently supply a stable amount of magical power.

Well, the amount of magical power used is proportional to the size of the volume.

<b>

When the magical power runs out, the magic will stop, and everything inside the bag will spill out.

To prevent that from happening, I’ll empty everything out and then replace the “magical power battery,” but with a carriage, that’s not possible. Everything inside would spill out, including the interior and furnishings!

That’s why for things like carriages that need to have space compression magic applied at all times, they use “Mana Assist,” which keeps the supply of magical power small and stable without interruption.

<b>

By the way, no matter how much space expansion is done to increase the volume, the weight itself cannot be changed.

If I pack the bag until it’s five times its volume, the weight will naturally increase as well. It’s not like the bag connects to another dimension and the weight doesn’t matter!

If I boost the magical power supply significantly, it seems that even this bag’s size could be increased to the volume of a whole warehouse, but I wouldn’t be able to lift such a thing, and even if I could carry it, if I placed it on the floor of my house, the floor would collapse and the house would fall apart. It’s a very impractical method! That’s what Marsh said!

So the amount of magical power used for space compression needs to be adjusted to what I can carry.

<b>

Well, I set the volume of my bag to about five times its original size!

This much is manageable. …I think Anna Mary looked at me with a face like, “Huh? That much?” when I set the volume...

Isn’t it normal for people from Amukamu? Everyone entering Iloshio for exploration usually sets their backpacks to about that size, right?

Conrad and Gilbert always said that was the case! …It’s normal, right? It’s normal, right?!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

While I was doing this, my luggage that I had left at the guard station arrived, and Anna Mary came to help, so the unpacking went surprisingly quickly.

I wondered why the guards who delivered the luggage looked so exhausted?

In any case, I wrapped some cookies baked in Amukamu and gave them to the guards as a thank you.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Shuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!!”

“Nyamyu…!”

<b>

The first to hug me was, as expected, Dana.

<b>

“Oh? Have you grown again? Yes, yes, good, good! You’re becoming more and more to my liking♪”

“Nyah nyah?! D-Dana?! W-What’s with the suddenness?! Nyan nyan meowww!!”

<b>

Dana moved her fingers all around, checking her existence, right, left, up, and down.

As I was in agony from Dana’s usual harassment, I heard a loud sound behind her, just as usual.

It was the sound of Dana’s head being hit hard by something solid!

<b>

“Ugh! Agh agh! My head! My head is splitting! It’s splitting!!”

“Dana! Enough already!”

<b>

Colin had hit the back of Dana’s head with the tray carrying the tea set he brought!

Dana was rolling on the floor, holding her head.

<b>

We were in one of the larger common rooms in the girls' dormitory.

The three of us had finished tidying up the room, and Colin had come to take us here.

While Colin went to prepare tea, Dana had found us in the common room and attacked us.

<b>

The common room was very spacious, with several sofas and tables, and even something resembling a bar counter in the back?! No way! Can you drink alcohol here?! Seriously?!

Oh, it turns out you can only drink coffee or tea… Oh, I was surprised. Apparently, there’s a dedicated barista who can brew any drink for you.

Indeed, the shelves in the back were lined with coffee and tea. Oh, the items on the left and right shelves are different so that the coffee aroma doesn’t mix.

Oh, the shelf over here has fruit juices? It seems there are strawberry juice, apple cider, ginger ale, and various others.

<b>

“There’s still a bit of time until dinner.”

<b>

Colin poured the tea from the pot into the teapot. Sitting down, I felt relieved as I enjoyed the tea and cookies he prepared.

After all, a lot had happened today.

<b>

“So, Su, let me introduce you! This is Amanda, my roommate!”

“G-Good to see you, Princess! I’m Amanda Lee from Wand!”

<b>

I didn’t quite understand what “so” meant, but after recovering from the damage to her head, Dana introduced me to her roommate who was also in the common room.

The introduced Amanda was a beautiful older girl with long silver-blonde hair that reached her back and gentle blue eyes.

<b>

Amanda is also from Wand village in Amukamu, just like us.

<b>

From what I heard, Amanda had come to Amukamu during last year’s harvest festival, and she said she had greeted me once then… Oh no! I don’t remember!

Oh no~~! I’m so sorry!! That’s very rude of me!!!

In a panic, I apologized, and she seemed embarrassed and flustered in return!

<b>

As we both panicked, we said we would get along from now on since she was my junior, but… am I still being called “Princess” here too?!

Please, spare me from that title, I can feel my cheeks heating up as I ask Amanda to stop calling me that, and then more people gathered around, calling out “Princess, Princess” in unison!

It seems everyone is from the vicinity of Amukamu, but please stop that! While I was getting more flustered, Bibi and the others just watched me with smirks, showing no signs of helping me at all!!

Isn’t that a bit cruel?!!

<b>

“There you are! You really are here!”

“Su! Long time no see!!”

“Oh my! You’ve become such a beautiful lady!!”

“K-Karla?! Jessica! W-Wait!! Alicia! N-No, not there! Nyaaaah!!”

<b>

As more people started gathering, the common room became lively with the arrival of three upperclassmen from Amukamu: Karla, Jessica, and Alicia.

<b>

In this boarding school, there are long breaks in summer and winter, and during those times, students are allowed to leave the dormitory and return home.

Everyone from Amukamu usually goes home during those times.

However, all three of them hadn’t returned to Amukamu this year because they had things to do here in summer and winter.

So, this was the first time in a year that I was seeing them.

While I was genuinely happy to reunite with the three of them after a year, this… this is a bit too much…!!

<b>

“Sniff sniff… Yes! It’s definitely Su!”

“Hmm, hmm, this feels even more…!”

“Mmm! This purple lace is so detailed! Beautiful!!”

“T-That’s why don’t sniff there… Nyaaaah! Why are you pinching me…?! N-No! Don’t lift that!!”

<b>

It’s the usual thing, really.

When I meet them after a long time, it’s always like this, getting all mixed up.

I knew it! I knew it!

<b>

But! After a year, isn’t this a bit worse than usual?!

They’re touching me in places that shouldn’t be touched! Sniffing me! Lifting my skirt!

They’re rubbing me, squeezing me, pinching me! This has gone beyond the level of harassment, hasn’t it?!!

<b>

“Hyah! Nya! Nya! Nyaaaah!!!”

<b>

An embarrassing voice that I couldn’t stop echoed throughout the room...

I could tell that the newcomers who had come to greet me were shocked by the scene unfolding in broad daylight… Sniff sniff.

After thoroughly enjoying themselves, the three of them released me, and as usual, I sank into a chair, feeling blank and as if my soul was about to escape from my mouth. Ouch!

<b>

After they had their fill, the three of them moved away from me and exchanged greetings with Bibi and Mia.

That’s strange? Why is their greeting so normal?

<b>

But is it just my imagination that Mia’s face looks slightly strained? And Anna Mary, who came later, seems to be standing behind with her cheeks twitching?

Well, I’m currently in a state where my soul is about to escape, so I don’t really understand...

<b>

“Hey Su, you must be tired after everything that happened today, right? Why don’t you go outside and take a breather? It’ll help you relax.”

<b>

Colin said kindly, as if concerned for me.

Is she trying to shield me from further abuse by placing me between her and Dana?

But! I’m fully aware that Dana and Colin were just now also snuggling and sniffing me together!!

<b>

Even so! I gratefully accepted Colin’s concern and decided to step outside quietly.

Everyone seems to be radiating a tense aura, glaring at each other...

What on earth is making them so heated?!

<b>

Speaking of which, I remember that back in Amukamu, there were times when we would butt heads like this...

And in the end, they would always ask me, “So, what do you think?! Suuu!!”

Usually, I would scream, “I-I don’t know! I don’t know!!” and run away!

Because I really don’t know! Fundamentally, I have no idea what opinion they’re asking for! There’s no way I could answer that!!

<b>

Right now, Mia and Anna Mary are glaring at Karla and the others, radiating an unusual aura.

It’s nice to be able to leave this scene quickly, just like usual.

<b>

I hid behind Colin, concealed my presence, and quietly slipped out of the common room without anyone noticing.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“It’s fine to leave the dormitory grounds, but you can’t go beyond the garden. Beyond that is the main school building’s grounds. During the break, entry to the main school building without permission is prohibited.”

<b>

That’s what Colin told me.

I don’t intend to go to the school building, but I’m a bit curious about the garden. After all, after being cooped up in a carriage for several days, it feels good to be in a spacious area.

Once I entered the school grounds, there was plenty of greenery, and I felt quite relieved, but I heard that the garden here is well-maintained, so I thought I’d extend my walk there.

<b>

I passed through a square with an open café, went through the white pillars that mark the entrance to the dormitory grounds, and walked back a bit on the red brick path I had come from, where a small entrance appeared to the right.

I had seen the flowers and plants flourishing at the end of this path when I arrived.

After descending the small stairs at the entrance and walking a bit down the path, I found a garden overflowing with greenery and flowers.

<b>

Neatly trimmed hedges were lined up, forming geometric patterns.

As I descended further into the garden, the shape of the garden became unclear, but I was surrounded by flowers and greenery.

<b>

Are those dahlias blooming? The yellow marigolds look cute.

Under the still hot sun, summer flowers were blooming vigorously everywhere.

A little further ahead, I could see a gazebo that looked majestic even from here.

Isn’t this place even more impressive than the garden at Amukamu House?

<b>

Well, this place was originally the castle of the local lord, so it’s probably natural for the garden to be beautifully designed.

<b>

The arched area in front of me must be the rose garden.

Colin had mentioned that this place takes pride in its rose garden.

Since it’s not the season for roses now, there probably aren’t any flowers, but I’m sure that during the season, that area will be filled with roses.

Oh, but it seems there are varieties that bloom in summer. I can see a few white flowers blooming here and there. I’ll go a bit closer to take a look.

<b>

<b>

“Oh? Are you a new student? Have you gotten lost?”

<b>

Just as I approached the arch, I was suddenly spoken to.

I knew there was someone working in the garden near the rose garden, so I had quietly approached to avoid disturbing them, but it seems I was noticed.

Well, it’s not like I was trying to hide my presence or anything.

<b>

“Hmm, it doesn’t seem like you’re lost. Were you perhaps out for a stroll?”

“Ah, yes! I heard there was a large garden, so I came to take a look!”

<b>

Peeking from behind the bushes was a man wearing a straw hat and work clothes.

He was probably the gardener. He looked to be in his thirties? Maybe around that age?

His half-closed eyes gave off a relaxed vibe, and he had a nostalgic look that made me feel strangely at ease.

<b>

Oh, calling him “old man” at that age might be rude, huh? I can almost envision my past self being called “old man,” clutching my chest and kneeling down.

…Yeah! “Old man” sounds a bit sad. I’ll call him “big brother” instead!

<b>

The gardener “big brother” was holding shears. It seemed he was pruning the roses alone in this heat.

<b>

“Thank you for your hard work in this heat. Are you taking care of this place all by yourself? That must be tough.”

“Hmm? Well, even if I say I’m alone, I’m only taking care of the rose garden. It’s not that tough. Besides, taking care of it at this time is important. I try to give it as much attention as possible.”

“I think the rose garden alone is quite large. It must be challenging.”

“Is that so? Well, this is partly a hobby of mine, so I enjoy doing it.”

<b>

I spoke casually, as I would with farmers back in Amukamu, but the gardener “big brother” smiled warmly and said so.

His carefree and genuine smile made it clear that he truly enjoyed his work, and I couldn’t help but smile back.

The “big brother” then started talking about the roses here.

The summer roses that are currently blooming. The roses that will fill this place during their peak season.

He spoke so joyfully that I found myself squatting down and listening to him, getting lost in the conversation.

<b>

Unintentionally, I was able to get closer to the gardener “big brother” and spent a delightful time with him.

I didn’t think I had spent that long there, but it seemed the sun had tilted slightly since I arrived.

The short summer shadows had grown quite long.

<b>

Then, I sensed someone approaching.

I could tell they were entering the garden, seemingly searching for something.

But soon, they seemed to find what they were looking for, and their movements became purposeful.

They walked straight toward me.

Could it be someone from the dormitory looking for me? But it doesn’t feel like someone I know...

Eventually, the person came right next to me and called out to me.

<b>

“Um! I heard there’s supposed to be someone taking care of the garden here… Our dorm supervisor told me to come and get you!!”

<b>

The person who approached was a male student.

It seems he wasn’t looking for me but rather came to call the gardener “big brother.”

<b>

The boy probably didn’t expect anyone else to be there besides the “big brother.” As he approached him, he noticed me squatting there and stopped in surprise, his eyes wide open.

I also stood up to apologize for startling him and turned my gaze toward the male student.

<b>

Hmm, since he has the same uniform color as us, he must be a first-year… a new student.

He had soft, curly brown hair and bluish-gray eyes.

Well, he doesn’t look bad at all! He has an appealing vibe that might attract girls.

Hmm? But I feel like I’ve seen him somewhere before? Where was it? Have we met somewhere?

Oh, could it be someone I met during the harvest festival, like the girls in the dormitory? Wait, how was it? What was it? I need to remember!

<b>

It seems he was also thinking something similar.

He looked at me with a thoughtful expression, stroking his chin.

However, while he was furrowing his brow and scanning me from head to toe, I couldn’t help but think it was a bit rude for a first-time meeting with a girl. But if I forgot about him, that would be a serious offense. I held back my urge to say something and desperately searched my memory for clues.

<b>

Eventually, as he raised his gaze from my feet to my waist, he seemed to realize something. Then, he clapped his hands as if to say, “I see!”

What? Did he remember something? It seems he figured it out before I did, and I felt a slight sense of defeat. I decided to switch my focus and prepare myself.

He would probably start with something like, “Long time no see, Princess Su!” which I’ve been hearing a lot lately.

Then I could respond, “It’s been a while! Um, where did we meet before? Hehe,” and that would help me figure out where we knew each other from.

I’ve only attended proper gatherings like the harvest festival in Amukamu, and I’ve only been to a few other events, so I should be able to remember where we met if I asked. Probably!!

<b>

As I maintained a calm smile while internally bracing myself, he suddenly hit me with a powerful strike from a diagonal angle with a delighted smile!

<b>

“Oh! The one in front of the main gate!! The girl in the purple thong!!!”

<b>

It’s a T-back, you little bratーーーーーーっっっ!!!!!!

Immediately after, my corkscrew caught his face, and I thought it was completely unavoidable!!
