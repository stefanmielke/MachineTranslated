# 86 A nostalgic reunion

The dorm room was much larger than I had expected.

<blank>

Large windows on the south side flooded the room with sunlight.

A breeze blew in through the open window, shaking the awning curtains.

The breeze that breezes inside the room carries the scent of the trees on the property, which is very pleasant.

<blank>

The room contained a dresser, a desk, a bookcase, and two beds, one on each side of the wall.

The space between the beds is quite wide. The spacing is probably more than 2 meters.

All the furniture in the room is plain and unobtrusive, but very harmonious and chic in design.

<blank>

I walked to the center of the room, looking at the structure of the room, and sat down on the bed there.

The cushioning is also good for your buttocks to sink into.

Unintentionally, the comforting feeling of the room causes the upper half of the body to fall into the bed as well.

I knew it. This bed is very comfortable.

With my arms outstretched and my body on the bed on my back, I am convinced that I have nothing to worry about when it comes to sleeping in the dorm.

After all, the comfort of sleeping is enough of a relief to start a new life!

<blank>

<blank>

To be honest, I am quite nervous about having to live in the same room with a stranger.

It would have been different if this was Bibi or Mia or some other hometown kid, but instead of being related to Amcam, this is someone who has no connection to it at all!

I can't help but freak out about this, okay?

<blank>

Just the thought of having to leave Sonia Mama and Howard Papa as well, and having to live far away from home alone, is enough to cause a furious feeling of discouragement to swirl around in my chest. ......

The saving grace is that AnnaMarie came with me.

I can't tell you how much peace of mind I feel now that AnnaMarie is by my side!

I am deeply grateful to Mama Sonia for making AnnaMarie my maid of honor!

But even so, it is a problem that does not eliminate the anxiety cleanly.

At the very least, I am now sincerely hoping that my roommate, who has yet to arrive, will be a cute and nice girl - .......

<blank>

<blank>

Now, if I were seen throwing myself onto the bed like this, just because it was comfortable, I would be scolded by AnnaMarie! I wonder if AnnaMarie would scold me?

But, what can I do? I'm tired from the long trip!

It's been a long time since I've been able to throw my body out like this in the daytime, and this sense of freedom feels good.

The carriage was much more comfortable than I expected, but still! Being in a carriage almost all day, every day, is still tiring!

But ......, most of all, the most tiring part was the last lucky shot, though!

<blank>

I wonder why it would be triggered at this time?

At the end of this trip!

Nope! At the first step of your new life?

Or does it happen because of that kind of timing?

U"~~~~! My face gets hot again when I remember!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Stop, stop! I'm enjoying the comfort of my bed! I have to change my mind quickly!

<blank>

Oops, that's right! Even if the bed is good, you have to have the all-important pillow!

I opened the bag I had brought and took out my favorite pillow from inside.

I put it on the bed and threw my body on the bed again to embrace it.

<blank>

Hmmm...here it is. Now you can get a good night's sleep. ......

Burying my face in the pillow and taking a deep breath, I feel a rush of calmness as if I am in my own room at Amcam.

Oh, I must have been nervous about my new life, after all.

I felt my body relaxing and became aware of such things again.

<blank>

Alright! Let's quickly dye this space for ourselves in our own color and establish our calmness!

Shaking off the desire to sink further into the pillows, I decided to take out my personal belongings from my bag and start organizing my room.

<blank>

At any rate, the next thing I pulled out of my bag was a fuzzy brown mass.

Yes! This is a stuffed brown crawler!

The stuffed animal is more than 50 centimeters long and very realistic in size, but its fuzzy texture is still very Chopin-like and very cute.

After all, this is the work of Fiorina, who is a good seamstress!

<blank>

Brown Crawlers are magical beasts, but they are popular with children. After all, it is a source of pocket money for children!

When we talked about whether we liked or disliked this brown crawler, Fiorina remembered that I said I liked it, and she gave it to me as a gift this winter.

Since then, she has been my bed companion. I can no longer sleep without her!

<blank>

Then he pulls out another stuffed animal.

Kochi is a slightly snooty stuffed jackalope that fits in the palm of your hand.

What a surprise! It was made by that Stefan!

<blank>

Stefan, a bratty kid, is probably the quickest in the village.

He has always been naughty and quick to slip through the hands of upperclassmen and adults and get away with it.

Because of this, Stefan's shirts and pants were always getting caught somewhere, ripping and tearing all over the place.

It's not that the Jing family was poor, okay? It's just that Stefan's mother's repairs couldn't keep up with the speed of Stefan's tyranny at all.

One day, Stefan was captured by his mother and forced to mend his clothes instead of being lectured and punished.

At first he was reluctant to learn, but his mother taught him, and whether he was suited to it or had a talent for it, Stefan's sewing skills quickly improved.

This was much to the surprise of Stefan's mother. Well, Stefan has always been very dexterous!

<blank>

Then one day, Stefan brought to school a patchwork cushion for himself.

I was so impressed with the quality of the finished product that I asked him if he thought it would be possible to make stuffed toys with it. I was so impressed with the quality of the finished product that I asked Stéphane if he could make a stuffed animal with it.

After many prototypes, Stefan presented me with this stuffed jackalope, which he had finally completed.

I can see Stefan's hard work in this, and I have treasured it ever since he gave it to me.

<blank>

She has learned to sew, and Stefan's pranks have become somewhat more mature.

Still! They were still trying to roll up my skirt, though!

Of course! There's no way I'm going to let you roll me up! Hmph!

<blank>

...... That's right. I don't have that kind of space! I'm not supposed to!

And yet! Why do I get hit by Lucky Scheme? Why is it that the wind is so damn windy ............? I can't do it! I'm going to go back to the direction I was ...... in, and I'll be fine, fine, fine! Switch, switch, switch!

<blank>

For now, let's just go on dong the contents of the bag!

Your favorite cushions. Hairbrushes and mirrors. My favorite books and several small containers.

One after another, I took them out and filled the room with my personal belongings.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The bag is quite large for its size, but this is because it is equipped with space compression magic similar to that of the carriage we rode in.

I said similar, but the ratio of their volumes is very different.

The magical expansion in the carriage was approximately 1.5 times the original volume. In contrast, the volume of my bag is about five times larger than the original.

This is due to the difference in the supply of magic used.

<blank>

The magic seal engraved on the frame of the carriage is said to be a system that automatically draws in small amounts of magic from mana flowing in the atmosphere or from underground veins in the ground, and is an automated institution that keeps magic activated even if the user does not supply the magic power. This kind of thing is called "mana assist.

<blank>

The bag, on the other hand, has a magic seal engraved on its frame, and the same magic keeps activating, but its magic power is supplied by a "magic battery".

The "magic battery" must be replaced when it runs out of magic power, but it can always provide a stable supply of magic power of a reasonable size.

Well, the amount of magic used is proportional to the size of the volume.

<blank>

If the magic runs out, the magic will run out and all the contents of the bag will fly out of the bag.

To prevent this from happening, we have to take out all the contents before replacing the "magic battery," but that is not possible with a carriage. Even the interior and furnishings would overflow outside!

Therefore, for things like horse-drawn carriages, which require constant application of space compression magic, they use "mana assist," which suppresses the supply of magic power to a small level and ensures a constant and stable supply without interruption.

<blank>

Incidentally, no matter how much space expansion is done to increase the volume, the weight itself cannot be changed.

If you fill the bag until it is five times the volume of the bag, the weight will naturally increase as it is. It is not magic that the bag is connected to another dimension and weight is irrelevant!

I heard that if we boosted the supply of magic power, we could raise the volume of this bag to that of a warehouse, but we could never lift such a thing, and even if we could carry it, the day we put it on the floor of the house, the floor would fall out and the house would collapse. It's a very impractical way of doing things! said Mr. Marsh!

So the amount of magic power to apply spatial compression needs to be adjusted to what you can hold.

<blank>

I have about five times the volume of my bag, though!

I can usually hold this much. When I set the ...... volume, I asked AnnaMarie, "What? That much?" I might have felt like she looked at me like that. ......

That's normal for AmCam people, right? Those of you who are going into the search for Irosio always keep your backpacks at that volume, don't you?

Mr. Conrad and Gilberto always said that's about right! ......It's normal, right? It's normal, isn't it?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, the luggage that had been left at the guard station arrived, and AnnaMarie also arrived, so the packing up of the luggage was finished earlier than expected.

What was it about the guards who delivered our luggage that made them look so tired?

At any rate, I wrapped up several cookies I had baked at Amcam and let the guards have them while thanking them for their hospitality.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

Hanyamyu ......!"

<blank>

The first to embrace me was, as expected, Dana.

<blank>

What? Growing up again? "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! It's getting more and more to my liking.

Nyanya? Da, da, da nya? I'm sorry, I can't hear you! Nyameyaaaa!"

<blank>

Dana moves her fingers all over the place, right, left, up, and down, as if to confirm their presence.

As usual, I was fainting in agony from Dana's sexual harassment, and as usual, pakoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong! and a good sound echoed behind it.

It was the sound of Dana's head being smacked as hard as it could with a hard object!

<blank>

Agagatsu! Agagatsu! Agatagatu head cracks! It's cracked, it's cracked, it's cracked, it's cracked!

That's why I'm here, Dana! That's enough!"

<blank>

It was the sound of Colin hitting Dana on the back of the head as hard as he could with the tray that held the tea set he had brought in!

Dana is rolling around on the floor with her head in her hands.

<blank>

This is one of several larger common rooms in the women's dormitory.

Colin came and brought us here just as the three of us were finishing cleaning up.

While Colin was out of his seat, he was discovered by Dana, who came to the common room and attacked him.

<blank>

The common room is very large, with several sofas and tables, and even a bar counter in the back? No way! You can even drink here? Seriously?

Oh, what, it's coffee and tea that you can drink. ...... Oh, I'm surprised. They have a dedicated barista who can brew any kind of beverage.

It is true that the shelves in the back contain only coffee and tea. Ah, so the left and right shelves contain different things because the aroma of coffee is transferred to the left and right shelves.

Oh, so what's on the shelf over here are fruit juices? I hear they have strawberry juice, apple cider, ginger ale, and many others.

<blank>

There's still a little time left for dinner."

<blank>

Colin poured a pot of tea into a tea cup. I sat down in the chair and enjoyed the tea and cookies, and felt relieved and at ease.

What a lot has happened today!

<blank>

So that's why I'm here, Sue. "So, Sue, I'd like to introduce you to my roommate, Amanda! This is me and my roommate, Amanda!"

Hello, it's been a while, Princess! I am Amanda Lee of Wand!"

<blank>

I don't know what the 'reason' is, but Dana, who had recovered from the damage to the top of her head, introduced me to her and her roommate who had come to the common room with her.

Amanda, who introduced me, was a beautiful lady with long silver blonde hair that reached her back and kind blue eyes.

<blank>

Amanda is from Wando Village in Amkam District, same as us.

<blank>

I heard that Amanda came to AMCAM last year during the Harvest Festival, and that she greeted me once at that time, but ...... is not good! I don't remember her!

Hee~~! I am so sorry~! I am very sorry~!

When I apologized in a panic, he was conversely horrified and made me wince!

<blank>

We were both waffling around like that, and I said, "I'm your junior from now on, so I'm looking forward to working with you! I said, "I'm your junior from now on, so I'm looking forward to working with you!

As I asked Amanda, feeling heat rising in my cheeks, to please don't call me that, people besides Amanda gathered around and started calling out, "Hime-sama, Hime-sama!

Apparently, they were all from the Amkam area, but please don't do that! I was getting even more upset, but Bibi and the others just looked at me with a grin and didn't seem to be helping me at all!

Isn't that kind of sidetracking!

<blank>

There he is! There he is!

Sue! Long time no see!

'Oh my god! You've become such a beauty!"

Ka, Kara?" Jessica! Wait, wait! Alicia! That's it, nyame there! Alicia!

<blank>

People began to gather in the common room, which was suddenly becoming lively, and more assailants joined them!

They are Kara, Jessica, and Alicia, three of Amcam's senior girls.

<blank>

<blank>

The boarding school has long vacations in the summer and winter, when students are allowed to leave the dormitory and return home.

Everyone in Amcam always returned to their hometowns at that time, too.

But none of the three have returned to Amcam this year, saying they have things to do here in the summer and winter.

So it has been a year since we have seen each other in this way.

I am really happy to see the three of them again after a year! This is ...... hey, hey ......!

<blank>

'Kunkakunka kunka ...... yeah! It's Sue! It's definitely Sue!"

The "mmmm, mmmm, mmmm, this! The feeling is even more ......!"

Mmmm! This purple lace is so finely made! Beautiful!!!!"

I'm not going to sniff your pussy ......! I'm not going to pick it ......! What? Don't roll me up!

<blank>

It's just the way it's always been.

When I see the three of them after a long time, they squirm like this as usual.

I knew it. I knew it, though!

<blank>

But...! It's been a year, and this time it's even worse!

They even put their hands in impossible places! They were sniffing and sniffing me! They rolled me up!

I was rubbed around, squeezed, and plucked! It's beyond the level of sexual harassment, isn't it?

<blank>

Hinya!" "Hinya! Nyah! Inya! Inyaaaaaaaaaa!!!!"

<blank>

An embarrassing voice that I can't stop myself echoes through the room. ......

I can see that the people who came to greet me, whom I have never met before, are very much disappointed when they see my lasciviousness unfolding in broad daylight. ...... shikshitsu shikshitsu shikshitsu.

I was released by the three men who had enjoyed themselves to the full, and as usual, I sank down helplessly into a chair with lewd eyes, turning white and my soul nearly falling out of my mouth. Ahh!

<blank>

Having enjoyed themselves to their heart's content, the three of them left me and also exchanged reunion greetings with Bibi and Mia.

That's funny, isn't it? Why is the greeting so normal over there?

<blank>

But is it my imagination that Mia's face is slightly twitching? Or is it that AnnaMarie, who came later, standing behind her, also seems to have a twitch in her cheeks?

Well, I'm not really sure because I'm on the verge of losing my soul. ......

<blank>

Hey Sue, I'm sure you're tired from everything that's happened today. Why don't you go out for some fresh air and relax a little?

<blank>

Colin spoke kindly to me, as if he cared.

Is it possible that you are putting yourself between me and Kara and the others in order to protect me from further tyranny?

But...! I am aware that both Dana and Colin got together earlier and sniffed each other!

<blank>

Still! I gratefully accepted Colin's concern and decided to quietly go outdoors.

They are all staring at each other, giving off a rather tense vibe. ......

What is it that makes these women so passionate?

<blank>

Come to think of it, even in the old days with Amcam, we used to pungska pungs like this! and sometimes we used to butt horns like this ......?

And at the end, they always say, "How's it going? Soooooo!!!!" and ask for my opinion.

I usually say, "I don't know! I don't understand that! and run away!

Because I don't know, don't I? Fundamentally, it is a mystery what opinion is being sought! There is no way I can answer that!

<blank>

Now, Mia and AnnaMarie are mainly staring at Kara and the others, radiating an extraordinary aura.

After all, the atmosphere was as usual this time, so I was grateful to be able to leave the place with Totto.

<blank>

I hid behind Colin and was able to slip out of the common room without anyone noticing.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

You can leave the dormitory grounds, but don't go beyond the garden, okay? You may leave the dormitory grounds, but you must not go beyond the garden, because that is the main school grounds. During the vacations, you are not allowed to enter the main school building without permission.

<blank>

Colin had taught me that.

I'm not interested in going to the schoolhouse, but I am a little curious about the gardens. After all, it was after a long journey in a horse-drawn carriage for days. After all, it feels good to be in a large space.

I'm quite relieved to see a lot of greenery once I get to the school grounds, but I've heard that the gardens at Coco are well-maintained, and I thought I'd extend my visit there anyway.

<blank>

Passing through the plaza with the open café and past the two white pillars that are the entrance to the dormitory grounds, a short distance back along the red brick road you walked down, you will soon come to an entrance on the right.

When I came, I could see the grass and flowers at the end of this path.

If you go down the small staircase at its entrance and go a little further down the path, you will find a garden full of greenery and flowers.

<blank>

The neatly trimmed hedges seemed to line up neatly and form a geometric pattern.

If you descend one or two more steps and find yourself in the middle of the garden, you will lose sight of its shape, but everything around you will be surrounded by flowers and greenery.

<blank>

Is that a dahlia blooming there? The yellow marigolds are lovely.

Under the still hot sun, summer flowers were blooming strongly all over the place.

A little further on, you can see a gazebo (pavilion), which even from here is a majestic structure.

Isn't this place more amazing than the gardens of Amcam House?

<blank>

Well, it is said that this place was originally the castle of a local lord, so perhaps it is only natural that the gardens inside the castle are of magnificent construction.

<blank>

The archway in front must be a rose garden.

Colin also told me that Coco is proud of its rose garden.

It's not rose season right now, so there are probably no flowers on it, but I'm sure the whole place will be covered with roses in season.

Ah, but it looks like there is a variety that blooms in summer. I can see some white flowers blooming. Let's go a little closer and take a look.

<blank>

<blank>

'Oh? Are you a new student? Are you lost or something?"

<blank>

As I approached the arch, I was suddenly approached by a voice.

I knew there were people working in the garden around the rose garden, so I approached quietly so as not to disturb them, but they seemed to be aware of me.

Well, I wasn't hunting, so I wasn't trying to eliminate the signs.

<blank>

"Well, it doesn't look like you were lost, does it? Perhaps you were out for a stroll?"

Oh, yes! I heard there's a big garden and I'm here to see it!"

<blank>

A man in work clothes wearing a large straw hat emerged from the other side of the plantation.

Perhaps he is a gardener. Age around 30? Alaska?

His languid, half-lidded eyes seem kind, and there is a sense of nostalgia that I have seen him somewhere before, making me feel strangely at ease.

<blank>

Oh, is it rude to be an "uncle" in Alaska? I have a vision of my former self being called an "uncle" and dropping to my knees, clutching my chest.

I'm sorry to hear about "Uncle"! I feel sorry for "Uncle", I feel a little pain in my heart too. ...... Let's call him "Oniisan" here! I'll call him "Oniisan"!

<blank>

The gardener, "Oniisan," had a pair of scissors in his hand. He seemed to be pruning roses all by himself in this hot weather.

<blank>

Thank you for your hard work in the heat. Do you take care of this place all by yourself? It must be hard work.

Hmmm?" Well, I'm only working in the rose garden, even though I'm alone. It's not that hard. Besides, it's important to take care of the roses this time of year. I try to take care of it as much as possible.

I think the rose garden alone is quite large. It still seems like a lot of work."

"Really? Well, it's kind of a hobby of mine, so I enjoy doing it.

<blank>

I unintentionally called out to him with an am-cam, as if I were talking to a farmer, but the gardener smiled at me and said, "I'll be right back.

It was an honest, carefree smile that showed they were really enjoying themselves. So, my mouth relaxed as I was taken in by her smile.

After that, "Oniisan" told me many things about Coco's roses.

The summer roses that are blooming now. The roses that fill this place at the height of their season.

He spoke so happily that I, too, enjoyed listening to him, and before I knew it, I was squatting there, listening to his story.

<blank>

Unexpectedly, I was able to spend a pleasant time getting to know the gardener, "Oniisan.

I don't think I spent that much time there, but the sun seems to be shining a little more than when I arrived here.

The summer shadows, which were supposed to be short, had grown much longer.

<blank>

There, I could sense the presence of people approaching.

I know that he enters the garden as if he is looking for something.

But soon, as if he had found something, he was no longer lost in his movements.

They come walking straight to here.

Is it someone from the dorm who came looking for me? But it doesn't sound like anyone I know, does it?

Eventually, the person came right up to us and called out to us.

<blank>

Oh, um! I came here because I heard that you were supposed to be tending to the garden here ....... My dorm supervisor told me to go get him!"

<blank>

It was a male student who came.

It seems that he came to call the gardener, not me.

<blank>

I guess the boys did not expect anyone else to be there except for "Oniisan. When he approached the "older man" and noticed me squatting there, he stopped and looked at me with surprise.

I stood up to apologize for startling him, too, and turned my attention once again to the boys.

<blank>

Hm, since the color of the tie is the same as ours, we must be the same freshman ...... new students.

Soft brown kinky hair and bluish gray eyes.

Yeah, I guess it's not bad looking. It looks like it would be a girls' thing.

Hmm? But I think I've seen it somewhere? Where was it? Have I met you before?

Oh, don't tell me it's someone you met at the harvest festival or something, like you did at the girls' dorm earlier? Huh? How was it? How was it? Remember me!

<blank>

Something tells me that the other side was thinking something similar.

He looked at me with a thoughtful face, rubbing his chin.

But the way she wrinkled her brow and looked at me from the top of her head to the tips of her toes was a little impolite for a girl whom I had just met, don't you think? I have to admit that it is a bit rude to look at a girl you've just met, but if you're forgetting about her, it would be extremely rude. I wanted to say something to him, but I held back and searched my memory desperately to remember him.

<blank>

When he looked up from my feet and shifted his gaze to my waist, he made a face as if he had suddenly noticed something. And then, he hit his hand as if to say, "I see! He then clapped his hands as if to say, "I see.

What is it? Did he remember something? Feeling a little defeated that he seemed to have remembered something first, I switched my attention to the other side of the room and prepared myself, hoping to at least get some information about where we had met.

Perhaps, "It's been a while, Princess Susie! or some other line that is often said these days.

Then he said, "It's been a while since we've met. Well, where was the last time we met? I can tell where we met by asking something like that.

The only proper soirée I've been to is the Amcam harvest festival, and only a few other things, so if I asked him where we met, he would immediately remember. Maybe!

<blank>

As I was smiling as calmly as I could, but inside I was bracing myself, he came in with a very happy smile on his face, and fired a powerful blow from diagonally behind me!

<blank>

Oh! In front of the main gate! The kid with the purple loincloth!

<blank>

It's a thong...konjarooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！

I think it was completely and utterly inevitable that my corkscrew caught him in the face right afterwards!
