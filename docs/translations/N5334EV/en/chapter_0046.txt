# Episode Zero

In the year 2418 of the Stellar Calendar, on the 6th night of the Red Moon in March

<b>

It was deep within a forest.

A sea of deep trees that continued to the ends of the earth.

As two moons, overlapping while leaving behind a faint light, were about to be shrouded in true darkness, four shadows swiftly ran across the land.

<b>

"Finally, finally made it?!"

<b>

A shadow the size of a child murmured with relief.

<b>

"Once we’ve come this far, the magical beasts cannot intrude. This land is protected by an ancient barrier."

<b>

A shadow with a silhouette resembling a woman quietly replied.

<b>

"Hah! What a ridiculous place! Well, it was somewhat enjoyable! Although, it’s all over now! Kahaha!"

<b>

A particularly large shadow spoke with amusement.

<b>

"It took longer than I thought. Let’s hurry."

<b>

A figure cloaked in robes urged them to move quickly.

<b>

"Yes! Lord Rodolph!"

"Damn it! Why do I have to go through this?!"

"Well, it’s good that we made it here safely, right?! Hey, Olbett! Kahaha!"

"I’m not a battle maniac like you! Halbert!"

"Hm? For someone who claims that, you sure have plenty of energy left! Huh? Kahaha!"

"Tch!"

<b>

<b>

It was a space that suddenly opened up amidst the densely growing trees.

The tall trees did not stretch high, but a field of grass thick enough to hide a person's form spread across the area, about the size of a sports stadium.

There was a raised area overlooking the open grassland.

<b>

Covered in plants yet revealing rocky surfaces, the elevated ground rose to overlook this plaza.

<b>

The four shadows climbed up to that high ground.

The opposite side of the plaza sloped gently, designed for people to ascend.

At the top, there was a small space resembling a stage or an altar.

It was just enough room for one person to stand.

<b>

"Clarymond. You all wait here."

<b>

The shadow called Clarymond, with beautiful platinum blonde hair, bowed gracefully.

<b>

"Understood, Lord Rodolph."

<b>

The figure draped in a heavy robe, referred to as Rodolph, stepped onto the altar site.

Though his face was obscured by a hood, the slight glimpse of his mouth revealed that he was a man not yet reached middle age.

The black robe had a velvet-like sheen, and the intricate embroidery made with golden threads at the cuffs and seams hinted at the high status of the one wearing it.

<b>

"Tch! How arrogant for a mere human..."

<b>

The small shadow called Olbett spoke with a tone of disdain.

His attire consisted of a black outer garment and a white shirt, adorned with a frilly jabot typical of nobility, at the center of which a vivid crimson jewel radiated a pure light.

<b>

"You’re in a bad mood, aren’t you, Olbett? Kaha!"

<b>

The shadow named Halbert was large and had a dark complexion.

Aside from wearing loose-fitting fabric resembling harem pants, he donned a small vest.

His half-naked body bore many tattoos that seemed to have magical significance.

His long dreadlocks and the red eyes peeking from behind his black beard held a light that belied his casual tone, suggesting a readiness for danger.

Strapped to his back was a massive sword, almost as large as he was.

It had a ruggedness that suggested it was made of strange bones, and the exposed blade gleamed with a gruesome luster, as if solidified with blood.

<b>

"Both of you, please be quiet. The ritual will commence shortly."

<b>

Clarymond, dressed in a red dress with exposed shoulders and a wide neckline, urged the two to be silent.

<b>

<b>

Standing at the center of the altar, Rodolph took out a small object from his pocket.

It resembled a tiny lantern that could fit in his hand.

He placed it in his right palm and raised it high towards the sky.

<b>

In the sky, the two moons beautifully overlapped, and soon the last remaining light was hidden.

As the world was engulfed in a shroud of darkness, the stars in the sky began to twinkle more brightly, illuminating the ground below.

Light gathered around the lantern, as if squeezed out from the darkness, and its center began to glow faintly.

<b>

As if responding to the lantern that emitted a pale lime green light, the ground beneath the man also began to emit light.

It wove geometric lines around the altar, inscribing a magic circle.

As the magic circle enveloped the altar, the plaza below began to emit light in response.

The earth covered in plants shone, and a similar pattern spread out, tracing the magic circle drawn on the altar, lifting the surrounding vegetation as pillars of light rose.

<b>

All the light began to converge within Rodolph's raised palm.

The light rising from his feet, the immense light ascending from the plaza below, and the starlight pouring down from the sky all gathered into the man's right hand.

The light was drawn into the lantern as if being absorbed, and… then everything from the sky fell down.

<b>

<b>

"……Wonderful. Lord Rodolph!"

"That’s amazing… there’s an unbelievable amount of magical power packed in there."

"Tch."

"This place was once a ritual site created during the age of the gods to summon deities from other realms. Whether that plan succeeded, we can no longer know… However, it is precisely during this time of the great eclipse when the two moons align and wane that this ritual circle can be activated. At present, all the magical power necessary for this ritual has been absorbed into the magic crystals. Currently, this area has become a void of magical power. Truly remarkable, Lord Rodolph! To gather such a torrent of magical power without waste is no ordinary feat!"

"That’s all thanks to the king’s assistance! Make sure to express your gratitude, human!"

"Of course, Olbett. It is only due to my lord's guidance that we have reached here. The gate we used to arrive was also due to my lord's power. I must surely follow that intent and put my strength to use! Olbett."

"Tch!"

<b>

<b>

"The path to the 'key' is still closed… huh."

<b>

Rodolph murmured as he gazed at the softly glowing magic crystal contained within the lantern.

<b>

"Clarymond. Let’s hurry."

"Yes! Lord Rodolph!"

"What? Didn’t we finish what we had to do?"

"Halbert. Currently, this entire area is in a state of magical vacuum. Soon, a wave of dense magical power from Iroshio will come rushing in to fill this void. The approaching magical power will become a tempest, and we will not be safe from it."

"Hey, hey, isn’t that dangerous? Do we have time to return to where we came from?"

"I have the gate key entrusted to me by my lord. However, there is no magical power available in this land to activate it."

"Hey! What do you plan to do, human?!"

"I will use that."

<b>

Rodolph pointed to the crimson star jewel shining on Olbett's chest.

<b>

"What?! Don’t mess with me!"

<b>

Olbett realized that Rodolph intended to use his own star jewel for the necessary magical power and became agitated.

<b>

"This is my secret treasure! Why should I have to use it for something like this?!"

"Fulfill your role. Lord Olbett."

"Y-you bastard! You were planning to use me as a spare source of magical power from the start, weren’t you?! This is no joke! Who would use my precious star jewel for you?! Just go ahead and get swallowed by the magical storm or whatever! It has nothing to do with me!"

<b>

Olbett did not hide his anger, baring his teeth and shouting at Rodolph.

<b>

"Will you refuse?"

"Of course! I absolutely refuse!!"

"Hmm, very well. Clarymond."

<b>

Rodolph withdrew his outstretched hand from Olbett and turned to face Clarymond.

<b>

"Yes! Lord Rodolph!"

"I will take you here."

"Ah! Lord Rodolph! Lord Rodolph!! Right now! I can offer myself to you! Ah!!"

<b>

Clarymond, with tears in her eyes, clung to Rodolph.

<b>

"What? What are you suddenly saying? What are you all doing?"

"It’s decided! You can use my life! My soul can be used by Lord Rodolph! Ahh! What happiness this is?!"

"Are you planning to convert Clarymond's soul into magical power to use the gate key?"

"What?! Are you insane?! You’re going to erase your existence for a human?!"

<b>

Ignoring Olbett, who looked exasperated, Clarymond gazed up at Rodolph with an ecstatic expression.

<b>

"Ahh… I am so happy, so happy. Lord Rodolph…"

"I’ll make it clear… I will use Clarymond. I have no intention of taking you who have not fulfilled your roles."

<b>

Rodolph embraced Clarymond, who had leaned into him, and carelessly pulled down the neckline of her dress.

The two large bosoms that had been restrained spilled out, swaying.

Clarymond trembled in response to the sudden movement.

With her glistening eyes, she looked up at Rodolph.

Rodolph, still gazing into Clarymond's eyes, let his right fingers wander to her chest.

Clarymond shivered and let out a soft sigh from her lips.

Rodolph's right hand emitted light, inscribing a small magic circle.

Clarymond's breath quickened, and her flushed face began to glow with joy.

What is happening! Olbett cursed inwardly.

<b>

"These guys! But if I forcibly take that magical tool, it should solve the problem!"

"Don’t do it. You don’t have the power to handle that. Olbett. You know that, right?"

"Damn it! Then you help too, Halbert!"

"That’s why I told you I’m completely drained! I used everything up fighting those magical beasts to get here! There’s nothing I can do today."

"How pathetic for someone called the 'Undying General Halbert.'"

"Just give in, Olbett."

"What did you say?!"

"Think about it. Even if we withstand the magical storm, we can’t get out of Iroshio without dealing with the magical beasts around here. Can you handle them? Moreover, there are many magical beasts that devour magical power around here. Even if you took 200 or 300 years, you wouldn’t be able to get out from here! Well, I wouldn’t mind that! And more importantly, it would be a waste to use Clarymond, such a sexy woman, like this! Kahaha!"

"Tch! You perverted battle maniac!!"

"Kahaha! Besides… the lord desires that too."

"Damn it… even the king."

"Think, Olbett. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here now."

"………Tch! I understand, Halbert. This time, I admit defeat. Hey! Human! Rodolph!!"

"…………"

"I’ll give this to you! But! This is a big favor! You understand, right?! Rodolph!!"

"……Thank you. Lord Olbett."

"Tch!!"

<b>

Receiving the crimson star jewel from Olbett, Rodolph picked it up with the tip of his right fingers.

He held his right palm upward at his chest, pinching the star jewel between his thumb and middle finger.

Then, he activated the gate key hidden in his right hand.

A small geometric magic circle unfolded in his hand.

At its center, Rodolph crushed the star jewel.

With a sharp sound, the shattered pieces of the star jewel scattered and dissolved into the atmosphere.

The released magical power swirled and intertwined with the magic circle.

The magic circle detached from Rodolph's hand, increasing in size and brightness, and eventually opened a gate before him.

<b>

"It seems to have opened well. Clarymond. Lead the two of them."

"Understood. Lord Olbett, Lord Halbert. Please hurry this way."

<b>

Clarymond, having straightened her disheveled attire, stood by the gate to guide the two.

<b>

"Hmph! I used my secret treasure! Of course!"

<b>

Olbett, with a sullen expression as if it were only natural, was the first to pass through the gate.

<b>

"Lord Halbert. I have one more request."

<b>

Rodolph called out to Halbert as he approached the gate.

<b>

"Sure, no problem… but it depends on the reward. Kaha."

<b>

Halbert replied while eyeing Clarymond from head to toe.

Clarymond did not move a single eyebrow.

<b>

"I’ll ask you later."

<b>

Without looking back, Halbert raised his hand and passed through the gate.

Clarymond followed after bowing to Rodolph.

<b>

Left alone, Rodolph turned his gaze northward towards the white towering mountains and directed a sharp gaze from beneath his hood.

<b>

"What significance does it hold for a god that merely exists? Even if the day comes when the world ends, they can just sit there and watch."

<b>

Weaving words as if to reproach something unreachable, Rodolph turned his back to the mountains and disappeared through the gate.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Soon, the moons that had been waning regained their light and began to illuminate the ground once more.

At the same time, an unseen storm swept across the earth.

It violently shook the plants, tearing apart those who unwittingly wrapped themselves in magical power, mixing and scattering them.

And the vast wave of magical power converged in the plaza, exploding.

The plaza, once covered in plants, was blown away, turning into a wasteland littered with rubble.

<b>

<b>

Eventually, tranquility returned to the deep forest.

The moons regained their original brilliance and illuminated the ground.

As if nothing had happened, the wind blew through the sea of trees, rustling the green waves.

<b>

In the deep forest, unchanged from before, a figure stood on a small elevated area resembling a stage.

The moons gently illuminated that figure.

A gentle breeze slipped through the trees, rising to the high ground.

The figure, standing still like a beautiful statue, let the pale pink cloak it wore sway softly in the wind.

The intermission ends here.

From the next time, it will be Chapter 2… but! It seems it will still take some time ＞＜

Please wait a little longer for Chapter 2 "The Undying Legion of Iroshio" <(_ _)>
