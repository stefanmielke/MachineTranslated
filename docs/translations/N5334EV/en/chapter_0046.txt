# episode zero

Midnight of the 6th day of the 6th month of the red month of the year 2418 3 in the history of the cinnabar.

<blank>

It is in a deep forest.

In a deep sea of trees that extends to the ends of the earth.

The two moons, both covered by shadows, overlap, leaving only a little light behind, and soon true darkness is about to fall on the land.

Four shadows run swiftly across the land.

<blank>

Finally, finally, we're here?

<blank>

A shadow the size of a child murmured reassuringly.

<blank>

The monsters can no longer penetrate here. This land is protected by an ancient ward.

<blank>

A shadow with a woman-like silhouette answers quietly.

<blank>

"Ha! This is a hell of a place! Well, it was fun in its own way! But I'm done with it now! Ha ha ha ha!

<blank>

One large shadow uttered the words in amusement.

<blank>

I took longer than I thought I would. Let's hurry."

<blank>

A robed figure urged them to hurry forward.

<blank>

Yes, sir! Master Rodolphe!"

I was like, "Damn! How could you do this to me?

Well, we got here in one piece, didn't we? Hey, Orbet! Kuhahahaha!

I'm not a battle freak like you! I'm not a battle maniac like you! Halbert!

Hmm? You have plenty of energy for that, don't you? Huh? Kuhahaha!

Tsk!"

<blank>

<blank>

It was a space that suddenly opened up amidst the deep growth of trees.

The space is about the size of an athletic field, with no tall trees growing, but enough grassy vegetation to hide people from view on all sides.

There is a hill overlooking the open meadow.

<blank>

A high plateau, covered with vegetation but with a rocky surface, rises up to overlook the plaza.

<blank>

Four shadows climbing up to its heights.

It was built with a gentle slope on the other side of the plaza for people to climb up.

At the end of the climb, there was a space that looked like a small stage or the remains of an altar.

It is fine and spacious enough for one person to stand.

<blank>

Clarimonde. You guys wait there."

<blank>

The shadow called Clarimonde was tut-tutting, dropping her beautiful platinum blonde hair.

<blank>

"Awe, Master Rodolphe."

<blank>

One figure in a heavy robe, called Rodolphe, steps into the ruins of the altar.

His head is covered by a hood, making it difficult to see his expression, but the slight glimpse of his mouth reveals that he is a man who has not yet reached his prime.

The velvety luster of the black robe and the luxuriousness of the fine embroidery with gold thread on the cuffs and front joints suggest the high status of the person wearing it.

<blank>

"Damn! You're just a human being, you know that?"

<blank>

The little shadow called Orbet uttered the words evasively.

He wore a black outer garment, a white shirt, and a jabot with many folds on the chest, like those worn by nobles, and at the center of the jabot was a jewel shining bright crimson, radiating a pure light.

<blank>

I'm in a bad mood. Orbet? Kuha."

<blank>

The shadow, called Halbert, was large and sallow-skinned.

Except for the lower half of the body, which is clothed in a loose fabric like sarouel pants, he wears a small vest-like object.

His half-naked body showed many tattoos with magical connotations.

His long dreadlocks and red eyes peeking out from a face covered with a black beard had an unguarded glint to them, despite his light tone.

On his back is a huge sword as big as he is.

The bare blade of the sword, which was not even sheathed, had a fearful luster as if the blade had been hardened with blood and created.

<blank>

Please remain calm, both of you. The ritual will be activated shortly.

<blank>

Clarimonde, wearing a red dress with her shoulders bare and her bust wide open, called their attention to them.

<blank>

<blank>

Rodolphe, standing in the center of the altar, pulled one of his tools from his pocket.

It's like a lantern, small enough to fit in your hand.

He placed it on his right palm and raised it high into the sky.

<blank>

In the sky, the two moons overlapped each other beautifully, and soon the little light that remained was hidden.

As the darkness shrouds the world, the stars in the sky shine brightly and illuminate the ground.

The lanterns were lit up as if squeezed out of the darkness, and the center of the lanterns became faintly luminous.

<blank>

The man's feet also began to glow, as if responding to the lantern's pale lime-green glow.

It weaves in and out in geometric lines to form a magic circle around the altar.

As the magic circle covered the altar, the plaza below lit up in response.

The earth covered with plants shined, and the same figure spread and drew enormously, like a magic circle drawn on an altar, and a pillar of light rose up, coiling up the plants covering the earth.

<blank>

All the light begins to gather in Rodolphe's raised palm.

The light that rises from his feet, the huge light that rises from the square below him, and the stars that fall from the sky gather to the man's right hand.

Into that lantern, the glow converged as if absorbed...and then everything in the sky fell.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... is wonderful. Dear Rodolphe!"

Wow... it's filled with a tremendous amount of magic power, isn't it?

"Tsk."

It is said that this place was once the site of a ritual created in the age of the gods to bring down the gods of the other world. Whether this plan worked or not, I do not know now.... Nevertheless, it is precisely at this time of the eclipse, when both moons are absent, that this ritual can be performed. Now, all the magic power to perform this ritual has been absorbed into the magic crystals. This area is now a magic vacuum. You have done a marvelous job, Mr. Rodolphe! It is no ordinary feat for you to gather up such a torrent of magical power!

It was only with the king's help that I was able to do this! Be thankful, human!

Of course, Master Orbet. It is only with My Lord's guidance that I can reach this place. The gate to reach this place is also by the power of My Lord. I must obey his will and make use of his power! Dear Orbet."

Tsk!"

<blank>

<blank>

The road to the key is not yet open...

<blank>

Rodolphe muttered as he stared at the pale, glowing magic crystals nestled in the lantern in his hand.

<blank>

Clarimonde. Let's hurry."

Yes, sir! Master Rodolphe!"

"What? Aren't you done doing what you're supposed to be doing?"

"Dear Mr. Halbert. There is currently a magical vacuum in this area. Soon a wave of Irosio's dense magic will come rushing in to fill the vacuum. The approaching magic will become a storm, and even we will not be safe.

"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Do we have enough time to get back to where we came from?"

We have the gate key from My Lord, but we don't have the magic to activate it. However, the magic needed to activate it is not available here at this time.

What are you going to do, human? What are you gonna do, human?

I will use it."

<blank>

Rodolphe pointed to the crimson star bead shining on Orbet's chest.

<blank>

What? Don't play with me!"

<blank>

Orbet fretted when he realized that Rodolphe intended to use his own star beads to apply the magic needed for activation.

<blank>

This is my keepsake! Why did I have to use it for this?

Do your part. Lord Orbet."

You! You've been planning to use me as a backup magic power from the very beginning, haven't you? You've got to be kidding! Who's going to use my precious star gem for you? I'm not going to use my precious star beads for you! It's none of my business!

<blank>

Orbet made no attempt to hide his anger, baring his fangs and shouting angrily at Rodolphe.

<blank>

Will they refuse?"

It's no wonder! I refuse!"

'Hm, good. Clarimonde."

<blank>

Rodolphe returns the hand he had extended to Orbet and turns to Clarimonde.

<blank>

Yes, sir! Master Rodolphe!"

I'll take it from here. I'll take you."

Oh! Master Rodolphe! Master Rodolphe! Now! Here! I can offer myself to you! Aah!

<blank>

Clarimonde's eyes were moist and she clung to Rodolphe as if to cling to him.

<blank>

What the hell? What are you talking about all of a sudden? What are you doing?

I have decided! My life! My soul is yours, Master Rodolphe! Oh, what happiness! What happiness!

"Are you going to convert Clarimonde's soul into magic power and use the gate key?"

What? Are you stupid? You! For the sake of humanity! You're gonna wipe us out for this?

<blank>

While Orbette's expression was twitching with dismay, Clarimonde was looking up at Rodolphe with a look of ecstasy on her face.

<blank>

Oh, I'm so happy, so happy, so happy. Oh, Mr. Rodolphe. ......"

I must warn you...you will be using my Clarimonde. I will not take you who will not do your part."

<blank>

Rodolphe took Clarimonde, who was leaning back, in his arms and pulled down the bust of her dress carelessly.

The two large tassels that had been held in place burst out and swayed as if popping.

Clarimonde shook herself in response to the popping tremor.

Clarimonde looks up at Rodolphe with moist eyes.

Rodolphe kept his eyes fixed on Clarimonde's and crawled his right five fingers across his chest.

Clarimonde writhed and wriggled, and a wistful breath escaped from her mouth.

Rodolphe's right hand glows and carves a small magic circle.

Clarimonde went, her breath uneven and her upturned face tinted with pleasure.

What the hell is wrong with you?ã€€Orbet said venomously.

<blank>

They are! But if you take that magic tool by force, it's all over!

Don't do it. You're not strong enough to handle it. Orbet. You know that, don't you?

Then help me out! Then you'll have to lend a hand too! Halbert!

I told you, I'm out of money! We used up everything we had against those monsters to get this far! There's nothing we can do today."

The "Immortal General Halbert" is pathetic!

Break here, Orbet."

What the hell?

Think about it. Even if you survive the magic storm, you will never get out of Irosio without taking on the monsters and beasts around here. Can you compete with them? And there are many magic-eating beasts around here. Even if it takes you 200 or 300 years to deal with them, you will never get out of Irosio! Well, I don't mind if you do! And besides, it would be a shame to waste Clarimonde, such an erotic woman, in a place like this! Kuhahaha!

Damn you, you battle maniac pervert! You battle maniac pervert!"

Kuhahaha! Besides ... Lord wants it too."

Damn... and the king, too.

Think about it, Orbet. Or else you wouldn't be here right now."

I'm at .........! All right, Halbert. This time, I'm losing now. Hey! Human! Rodolphe!

"............"

I'll give you this! But, you know what? You owe me big time! You know that, don't you? Rodolphe!

"Let us thank ....... Lord Orbet."

Tsk!"

<blank>

Rodolphe received a crimson star bead from Orbet and picked it up with the fingertips of his right hand.

Hold the right palm upward at the chest, plucking the star bead with the thumb and middle finger.

He then went on to activate the gate key in his right hand.

To the right, a small geometric magic circle unfolds.

At its center, Rodolphe shattered a star bead.

The pieces of the star beads, which scattered with a high sound, dissolved into the atmosphere and disappeared.

The unleashed magic power swelled and spread, swirling and overlapping with the magic circle.

The magic circle left Rodolphe's hands, grew in size and brilliance, and soon opened a gate in front of him.

<blank>

It seems to have opened well. Clarimonde. Lead the two of them out."

Thank you very much. "My dear Mr. Orbet, my dear Mr. Halbert. This way, please, pass quickly."

<blank>

Clarimonde, who had straightened out her attire, stood by the gate as if to guide them.

<blank>

"Hmmm! He used my trinkets! Of course I did!"

<blank>

Orbet is the first to go through the gate with a discouraged look on his face, as if it were a matter of course.

<blank>

"Mister Halbert, I have a favor to ask you. I have a favor to ask you once more."

<blank>

Rodolphe called out to Halbert as he approached the gate.

<blank>

I don't mind. Well, it depends on the reward.... Kuha."

<blank>

Halbert replied as he looked at Clarimonde, licking her from top to bottom.

Clarimonde doesn't move an eyebrow.

<blank>

I'll ask you later.

<blank>

Without looking back, Halbert walked through the gate, raising his right hand.

He bows to Rodolphe and Clarimonde follows.

<blank>

Rodolphe, who remained alone, turned his gaze sharply from behind his hood to the mountains rising white in the north.

<blank>

What is the meaning of existence of a God who merely exists? Even if the world comes to an end, we should just sit there and continue to watch.

<blank>

Rodolphe spun his words as if he was accusing something unreachable, then turned his back on the mountains and disappeared through the gate.

<blank>

Soon the missing moons returned and began to illuminate the earth with their own light once again.

At the same time, an invisible storm blows through the ground.

It shakes the grass and trees violently, tearing, stirring and blowing about those who wear magic on their bodies unprotected.

Then the enormous wave of magic converged in the plaza and exploded.

The plaza, which had been covered with vegetation, was uprooted and turned into a wasteland of rolling debris.

<blank>

<blank>

Soon, silence returns to the deep forest.

The moons regain their original brilliance and illuminate the earth.

The wind blew through the sea of trees as if nothing had happened, causing the green waves to rustle.

<blank>

In the midst of the deep forest, which had remained unchanged from before, a figure somehow stood on a small stage-like elevation.

The moons gently illuminate the figures.

The wind gently blowing through the trees and up to the high ground.

The figure stood like a beautiful object, not even moving its body, and the light red cloak it wore was swaying softly and secretly in the wind.
