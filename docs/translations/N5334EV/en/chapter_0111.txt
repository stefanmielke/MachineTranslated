# Episode 99: Blue Reverie

A story from the day before the entrance ceremony

----------------

<b>

For the girl, it was a vague and very strange time, as if she were dreaming.

The carriage carrying the girls, along with the large black horses pulling it, moved silently like shadows along the road through the dark forest, where the sun no longer shone.

<b>

The interior of the carriage was spacious, with ebony furnishings and a sofa covered in deep sea-like blue velvet, which stood out prominently within.

On that large sofa sat a woman, stretching her long legs and leaning back in a languid pose.

The outfit the woman wore was something not often seen in this country.

<b>

The fabric she wore was predominantly indigo, and when she sat on the blue sofa, it seemed as if the place where she sat was connected to the depths of the sea.

The woman's skirt was layered with many drapes and adorned with numerous decorations. As her legs moved, various patterns appeared and disappeared, as if one were looking through a kaleidoscope.

Watching her, one could almost feel a strange illusion, as if legs, arms, body, and face were peeking out from behind multiple layers of blue curtains on a stage.

<b>

The woman's outfit was open from below her chest to her lower abdomen, revealing her brown skin without hesitation.

The fabric that was supposed to cover her chest was wide open, unabashedly displaying the woman's graceful cleavage.

For the girl sitting across from her, the woman's attire was somewhat overwhelming as a fellow woman.

Even for the young twins sitting beside her, the outfit seemed a bit too stimulating, and she reached out to embrace them, but the two had already leaned against the girl and were quietly sleeping.

<b>

"It's no wonder, you must have been quite tired."

"…Y-yes, thanks to you, I was saved."

"It's alright, this must be some kind of fate. We help each other in times of trouble, right?"

<b>

The woman's voice was cool and pleasant, and the girl felt strangely at ease.

The woman narrowed her emerald eyes gently and spoke kindly to the girl in her beautiful voice.

<b>

<b>

A little while ago, when the carriage the girls were riding in was traveling along the dark forest road, it was suddenly attacked by a magical beast.

It was a large mountain dog-like magical beast with red eyes glowing in the dark.

The coachman and his assistant were also acting as guards, but against a pack of more than five, they had no means to defend themselves, and the carriage was dragged down, injuring them, while simultaneously losing their horses.

Just when it seemed their lives were about to be taken, the woman's carriage happened to pass by, and her attendants drove off the magical beasts.

<b>

After that, the woman and her attendants even towed the girls' carriage, which had lost its horses, to a nearby village.

However, they were told that procuring new horses would not be possible immediately, so the passengers were to be stranded in that village.

<b>

However, for the girl, this situation was serious.

The journey was already delayed, and now it was certain that she would not make it in time for the entrance ceremony scheduled for tomorrow.

<b>

Perhaps sensing the girl's anxiety, the woman offered to take her to the intended city.

While it was a grateful offer for the girl, she could not accept help for herself alone, leaving the other passengers behind. Moreover, she did not want to impose such a burden on someone she had just met, so she was about to decline the offer.

However, the elderly couple and a middle-aged man who claimed to be a merchant, who were also in the carriage, were mentally exhausted from the magical beast attack and were not feeling well, so they wanted to stay overnight in the village.

"We will take our time to proceed once the new horses arrive, so you should accept the ride," they encouraged her.

Furthermore, the woman said, "I can't just leave such small children unattended for long," and before she knew it, the girl was being ushered into the carriage.

<b>

◇　◇

<b>

"By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm Rual. I travel around various countries and engage in trade."

"…Ah, I-I'm Karen Merlin. Th-these two are my younger brother Dan and sister Nan. Thank you again."

<b>

The girl, distracted by the woman's attire, hurriedly responded to Rual's introduction and expressed her gratitude.

<b>

"Hehe, it's a dress you don't see much in this country, right? I handle quite a few unusual items like this."

<b>

Noticing the girl's curious gaze, Rual smiled, lifting the hem of her skirt playfully while explaining her outfit.

On the other hand, the girl realized her gaze had been rude and, feeling embarrassed, lowered her eyes.

<b>

"Ah, um, s-sorry…"

"Hehe, it's fine, I don't mind. In fact, I'm happy that you're interested in it."

"R-really?"

"Yes, really! It's nice when others like something you like, isn't it? Haven't you ever had that experience?"

"W-well, I suppose there might have been…"

"Really? Is that a friend? It's wonderful to have a friend who likes the same things."

"A-a friend… I-I don't have anyone like that anymore…"

"Oh? Is that friend no longer around?"

"…"

"One realizes what is precious only after losing it."

"…"

"Then you should cherish it next time."

"…Huh?"

"When you make a friend next time, just make sure to protect them so you don't lose them again."

"W-wait… for me to have friends again…"

"You can! You're so charming."

"Th-that can't be… I'm not…"

"Hehe, you are charming! You're very cute."

"That's… something I've never been told…"

"Hehe, that's because others have been jealous of you. You've probably been in such an environment until now… how unfortunate."

"…Ah, n-no, that's not true…"

"But it's okay, you will be loved. You'll surely make wonderful friends."

"W-me?!… N-no, I…"

"And… one day, the things you've lost may come back to you."

"…the things I've lost…"

"So you should protect what is precious to you. Just like you're holding those two little ones."

"Protect…? Me?"

"Yes, you must protect what is important to you. Hold it tightly to your chest and don't let it go this time."

"My… precious thing…"

"What could your precious thing be, I wonder?"

<b>

With narrowed eyes, Rual reached out and touched the small pendant hanging at the girl's chest with her slender fingertip.

<b>

"It's small but a lovely stone, isn't it? Isn't this also something precious?"

"T-this is a precious pendant I received from my mother on my birthday! It's very important to me!"

<b>

The girl hurriedly shielded the pendant with both hands, pulling her body back.

<b>

"Hehe, it's alright, I won't take it. I'm sorry if I startled you."

"N-no… I apologize for that."

"But you still have something precious, don't you? It's a very beautiful stone."

"Y-yes… I like the color red…"

"…Red is a wonderful color. Deep, warm… and very sweet."

"…? Y-yes."

"Make sure to keep it tucked away safely in your chest, so it can surely convey your heartbeat above your heart…"

"…above my heart."

<b>

As the girl positioned her hands to protect the red gem on her chest, Rual gently placed her right hand over the girl's hands, whispering softly as if to reassure her.

<b>

"This is the proof of your life. The weight of your heart, equal to that of a precious person. Losing this would mean losing that precious person again. If that precious person disappears from your side, your heart may also vanish…"

"Th-that… I don't want that…"

"Oh? Then you must protect what you love dearly. You must never let go of that precious person. Feel it more with your hands, your heartbeat, your life."

"…my life?"

<b>

Rual's voice was soothing, and her emerald eyes sparkled like lights swaying in the dark night, making it impossible for the girl to look away from her.

For a moment, the girl felt a golden shimmer in Rual's emerald eyes, but she did not pay it any mind.

<b>

She simply listened to Rual's words, surrendering herself to the melody of her voice and her gentle words, feeling that the ambiguous answers she repeated were very comforting.

It felt as if she were in a dream, with a thin veil of reality, and she even sensed a strange floating sensation.

<b>

How long did that dream-like time last?

With a vague feeling as if she were moving through mist, she had somehow arrived at the facility where her young siblings, Dan and Nan, were to be left.

<b>

She couldn't even remember when she had reached the city of Dekkenbel.

Rual, saying it would be cruel to wake the sleeping children, had her attendants carry the two inside the facility.

While lovingly stroking the heads of the two who remained asleep, she asked the elderly couple managing the place to take care of the twins, and the girl left the facility.

<b>

"You must protect what is precious."

<b>

When she returned to the carriage, Rual spoke those words.

The girl nodded slightly, holding back tears that threatened to spill.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, can I give you a present?"

"…Huh?"

<b>

At Rual's sudden proposal, the girl looked up, unable to hide her confusion.

She realized that the item in Rual's hand was a simple, thin box, but it was clearly a jewelry case for holding gems.

<b>

"Hehe, it's a gift. I want to give you something to commemorate today."

"W-wait, for someone I've just met…"

"Time doesn't matter. I just want to give you a gift. Here, take it."

<b>

When Rual opened the case, a small red stone connected by a thin chain was nestled in the center, wrapped in a blue satin glow.

The girl gasped, realizing it was a luxurious item that clearly didn't suit her.

<b>

"What? S-such a beautiful thing? This gem…"

"This isn't a gem, you know? It's a magical stone."

"A magical stone…?"

"This anklet has a body enhancement spell enchanted on it. I'm sure you'll like it. Plus, with its blessing, your body will feel lighter, and you'll be able to run a bit faster. You said you like running, right? I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

<b>

Hearing that it wasn't a gem eased the girl's feelings slightly.

Seeing this, Rual took the girl's leg and gently lifted her slender leg.

<b>

"I'll put it on your left foot, so lift your leg a little…"

<b>

As if handling something fragile, she carefully adorned the girl's ankle with the thin golden chain anklet using her delicate fingers.

<b>

"Yes, see? It's beautiful. The red color really suits you."

"D-do you think so…?"

<b>

"I also create magical equipment. This is one of my prototypes. It's safe, you know? If you feel any discomfort, you can take it off. I want you to try it out and tell me how it feels the next time we meet."

"…I'll borrow it."

"That's right. So, just return it to me the next time we meet."

<b>

<b>

<b>

Before she knew it, the girl had stepped out of the carriage and was standing before a large gate made of two stone pillars.

The gate was already closed, but the girl caught a glimpse of Rual's attendant communicating something to the gatekeeper, and one of the guards ran inside.

Rual also stepped out of the carriage, standing before the girl, gently placing her hand on the girl's cheek, and looking down at her small frame with kind, narrowed eyes.

<b>

"I hope to see you again, Karen. I'm looking forward to the next time we meet. Truly, I'm really looking forward to it."

<b>

As she stroked the girl's cheek with a hint of reluctance, Rual smiled, raising the corners of her deep crimson lips, and then disappeared into the shadows at the back of the carriage.

The black carriage that had swallowed Rual also vanished silently, as if melting into the mist.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The girl couldn't remember when she had passed through the gate of the school.

By the time she realized it, she was walking behind a woman who introduced herself as the dormitory supervisor.

The dreamy, half-asleep time had passed.

<b>

The girl was led by the dormitory supervisor, progressing down the already darkened hallway. The faint light from the lamps lining the corridor illuminated her feet.

With each lamp she passed, she felt a strange sensation, as if she were waking from a dream and returning to reality.

<b>

As her senses regained their reality, a wave of anxiety began to rise within the girl's chest.

The life she was about to begin for the first time, the people she would be living with for the first time, thinking about the days ahead made her feel as if ice had been inserted into the core of her body.

<b>

Following the straight back of the supervisor down the dimly lit hallway, she realized she was more tired than she had thought, as the weight of the bag she held began to dig into her hands.

When that back stopped in front of a door, the stone in her chest felt heavier and larger, as if it were about to crush her.

<b>

The supervisor knocked on the door, placed her hand on the doorknob, and slowly opened the door.

A gentle light spilled out from the room into the dark hallway.

And beyond the opened door stood a girl radiating the light of a ruby.

<b>

It was there that the girl met her for the first time.
