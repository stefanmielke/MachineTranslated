# 99 Blue Sleep

The day before the entrance ceremony


----------------

<blank>

It was a very strange time for the girl, as vague as if she were dreaming.

The carriage in which the girls rode, and the horses that pulled it, were as black and large as night, and ran noiselessly like shadows on the road through the forest, which was no longer lit by the sun.

<blank>

The interior was spacious, with an ebony interior and a sofa made of blue velvet fabric that resembled the deep sea.

On the large sofa, a woman stretches her long legs and leans her body lazily against it.

The woman wears a costume that is not so familiar in this country.

<blank>

The fabric she wears is a blue indigo all over, and when she sits on the blue sofa, it is as if she is connected to the bottom of a deep sea, just where she is.

The skirt worn by the woman has many layers of drapes and is decorated with many ornaments. As if she were turning a kaleidoscope, various patterns appear and disappear as she moves her legs.

Watching the performance, I even had the strange illusion that my legs, arms, body, and face were peeking out from between the many layers of blue rugs on the stage.

<blank>

The woman's costume is open from the bottom of her chest to her lower stomach, showing off her brown skin without hesitation.

The fabric that would normally cover her bosom was wide open, generously revealing the woman's ample cleavage.

For the girl sitting across from the woman, the woman's attire was a sight for sore eyes as a member of the same sex.

I thought the outfit was a bit too much of a stimulant even for the young twin brother and sister sitting on either side of me, and I reached out to hold them, but they were already leaning against the girl and quietly sleeping.

<blank>

No wonder. You must have been very tired.

"......, yes, thanks for the help."

It's okay, this is just another chance for us to be together. When you're in trouble, it's mutual.

<blank>

The woman's voice was cool and pleasant, and the girl felt strangely calm.

The woman squints her emerald eyes tenderly and speaks softly to the girl with her beautifully toned voice.

<blank>



<blank>

A short time before now, the carriage in which the girls were riding was driving along a dark forest road when it was suddenly attacked by a magical beast.

It is a large, black-furred, mountain-dog magical beast with glowing red eyes.

The coachman and his assistant, who were also his escort, were dragged down by a herd of five or more horses, leaving them both helpless, wounded, and without a horse.

Just as they were about to be reaped to life, this woman's carriage passed by, and her followers fought off the magical beasts.

<blank>

Afterwards, the woman and her followers even towed the girls' horse-drawn carriage, which was now without a horse, directly to a nearby village.

However, the passengers were stranded in that village because new horses could not be procured immediately.

<blank>

But for the girl, the situation was serious.

Even the itinerary had been delayed, but now they would certainly not make it in time for the entrance ceremony scheduled for tomorrow.

<blank>

Perhaps sensing the girl's impatience, the woman offered to drive her to the desired town.

The girl was grateful for the offer, but she could not leave the other passengers behind and be the only one taken care of. She was about to turn down the offer, thinking that she could not cause that much trouble for someone she had never met before.

However, an elderly couple who shared a carriage and a mature man who said he was a merchant were mentally exhausted and not in good health after the attack by the magical beast, so they wanted to stay overnight in this village.

We will move on slowly after the new horse arrives, so the girl should be sent on her way. He pushed her back.

The woman also said to me, "You can't leave those little children there forever," and so I was unceremoniously put on a horse-drawn carriage.

<blank>



<blank>

Oh, by the way, I haven't introduced myself yet. My name is Luar. I'm Luar, and I'm a businessman who travels to many countries.

...... "Oh, wow, my name is Karen Marlin. These two are my brother Dan and my sister Nan. Again, thank you."

<blank>

The girl, who had been distracted by the costume the woman was wearing, hurriedly responded to the woman's introduction and thanked her.

<blank>

We sell a lot of unusual items like this," she said. We carry a lot of unusual items like this.

<blank>

Noticing the girl's curious gaze, the woman, who identified herself as Luar, lifted the corner of her red lips and happily picked up the hem of her skirt as she explained the outfit she was wearing.

The girl, on the other hand, realized that her gaze had been impolite and dropped her gaze, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment.

<blank>

Oh, um, I'm sorry. ......"

'Hmph, that's okay, I don't mind. I'm just glad you're interested in this."

Is that so?"

Yes, it is, isn't it? Isn't it nice when you like something and others like it too? Don't you ever feel that way?"

"Well, that's not ...... true, no, come to think of it, there may have been ...... such a thing ......."

'Is it? Is that a friend? It's so nice to have a friend who likes the same things you do."

"Oh, I can't ...... believe you're my friend, and I can't ............ believe you're such a child anymore."

"Oh? Is your friend gone?"

"............"

You don't realize how important something is until you've lost it.

"............"

Then take care of it this time."

"...... what?"

Next time you have a friend, just take good care of it so you don't lose it, okay?"

"Oh, no. ...... I don't have any friends ...... again."

You can do it, you're such a charmer."

"Oh, no, that's not ...... what I'm ...... about."

"You're charming, aren't you? You're very pretty."

"I've never ...... been told such a thing ......."

'Huh, that's because everyone around me was jealous of you. I bet you've been in that kind of environment all your life. ...... Poor thing."

"...... ah, ah, ...... no, no, that's not ......"

But don't worry, you will be loved. You'll make great friends.

Wow, me?" ...... No, no, I'm ......"

And ...... someday, even lost things might come back."

"...... Lost and Found, Mono ......"

So you just go and protect what's important to you, just like you're holding those two little people. Just like you are holding those two little ones."

"Protecting ......? Me?"

Yes, you have to protect what is important to you. You must hold it firmly in your heart and never let it go this time so that you will never lose it again.

"My ......, my precious ......"

I wonder what it is that you value so much?"

<blank>

Squinting, Rual extended his arm and ran his slender fingertips over a small pendant that hung on the girl's chest.

<blank>

'It's a small but pretty stone. Isn't this one of those precious things, too?"

This is a precious pendant that my mother gave me for my birthday a long time ago! It is very precious!"

<blank>

The girl panicked and pulled her body back, protecting the pendant that Luar had put her fingertips on with both hands.

<blank>

"Don't worry, I won't take it away. I'm sorry, did I scare you?"

No, no, ......, here's my apology.

But you still have something very important, don't you? It's a very beautiful colored stone.

"is, yes ......, red is my favorite color and ......"

...... red is a wonderful color. Deep, warm ...... and a very sweet color."

?" ......, yes."

Keep it tucked away in the back of your chest, out of sight and out of mind. Keep it hidden from the public eye, so that it may be sure to beat on your heart. ......"

"...... on the heart."

<blank>

The woman gently placed her own right hand on top of the girl's two hands, which were clasped together as if protecting a red jewel on her chest, and whispered quietly, as if to say so.

<blank>

This is the proof of your life. This is your heart, which weighs the same as your loved ones. If you lose this, you will lose your loved one again. If your loved one disappears from you, your heart may disappear as well. ......

"Oh, no ......, I don't want to do that ......, I don't want to do that ......."

I'll tell you what. Then it's what you love. You have to protect it so that you never let go of the one you love. Put your hands on it more, feel your heartbeat, feel your life."

"...... my, life?"

<blank>

Ruar's voice was pleasant, and his emerald eyes were like lights flickering in the dark night, making it impossible for the girl to take her eyes off Ruar.

For a moment, I thought I saw a golden gleam in Rual's emerald eyes, but the girl paid no attention to it.

<blank>

Just listening to Ruar's words, letting the tone of his voice, his gentle words, and repeating his vague answers, seemed very comfortable to the girl.

It was as if I was in a dream, with little sense of reality, and I even felt a strange floating sensation.

<blank>

How long did these dreamlike moments last?

With a vague sense of progress, as if we were moving through a fog, before we knew it, we had arrived at the facility where we were taking care of Dan and Nan, my younger siblings.

<blank>

The girl does not even remember when she had reached the city of Dekenbel.

Luar had his squire hold them and take them inside the facility, because it would be pitiful to wake a sleeping young child.

The girl left the facility, patting their heads lovingly and asking the elderly couple who ran the place to take good care of the twins.

<blank>

You have to protect what's important to you."

<blank>

Back in the carriage, Rual says a few words.

The girl gave a small nod to his words, holding back the tears that were about to spill out.

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, yes, will you allow me to give you one of these?"

"......, yes?"

<blank>

The girl looked up, unable to hide her confusion at Rual's sudden suggestion.

The object in his hand, though a thin box of simple construction, was a jewelry case of some kind, he realized.

<blank>

I have a gift for you. I want to give you a gift in honor of today."

Oh, no. I just met you. ......"

I don't care what time it is. I just want to give you a gift. Here, take it."

<blank>

When Rual opened the case, it was covered in a blue satin shine and a small red stone, connected to a thin chain, was in the center of the box.

The girl is blindsided by the fact that it is clearly a luxury item that she and others do not deserve.

<blank>

What? This beautiful thing? Jewelry like this ......"

This isn't a gemstone, okay? It's one of those magic stones."

"Well, is it the magic stone ......?"

The anklet is enchanted with a strengthening magic. You will love it. It will also make you feel lighter and run a little faster. You said you like to run, didn't you? I think you'll like it.

<blank>

The girl's feelings relax slightly at Rual's words that it is not jewelry.

When Luar spotted this, he took the girl's leg and gently lifted it in his hand, taking the girl's frail leg in his.

<blank>

"Put it on your left leg and raise it up, try lifting your leg a little ......"

<blank>

As if handling a fragile object, he carefully placed an anklet of thin gold chains around the girl's ankle with his slender fingertips.

<blank>

Yes, it's beautiful. The red color suits you.

Is that right ......?"

<blank>

I also make magical equipment. This is one of the prototypes. There is no danger. If you feel any discomfort, you can take it off. I'll lend it to you so you can try it out and let me know how it feels the next time we meet.

"...... to borrow."

Yes, I do. So just give it back to me the next time you see me."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The girl found herself getting off the carriage and standing in front of a large gate made of two stone pillars.

The gate door was already closed, but out of the corner of the girl's eye she could see one of the guards running to the back of it as Rual's squire told the gatekeeper something.

Luar also dismounted from the carriage and stood in front of the girl, placing her hand on her cheek as if to bid her farewell, and looking down at her petite body with kindly eyes.

<blank>

I look forward to seeing you again Karen. I look forward to seeing you again. I'm really, really looking forward to it."

<blank>

She stroked the girl's cheek regretfully, and said so as she lifted the ends of her thin crimson lips. Then she sank into the shadows behind the carriage and disappeared from sight.

The black carriage that had swallowed Rual also disappeared without a sound, as if melting into the fog.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The girl does not remember when she passed through that gate of the school.

I found myself walking behind a woman who identified herself as the dorm supervisor.

Time had passed in a hazy, dream-like sleep.

<blank>

The girl is led by the dorm supervisor down an already darkened corridor. The faint lights of the lamps lining the corridor illuminate the girl's feet.

Each time she crossed one of the lights, she felt a strange sensation as if she was waking up from a dream and coming back to reality.

<blank>

As her senses regain a sense of reality, anxiety wells up in the girl's chest.

When I think of my first life, the people I will be living with for the first time, and the days that lie ahead, I begin to feel as if ice had been shoved into my core.

<blank>

As I followed the straight back of the dorm supervisor down the dark corridor with only a faint light, I was perhaps more tired than I had expected, and the weight of the bag in my hand was digging into my hand, jitterily.

When his back stopped in front of one of the doors, the stone in his chest grew heavier and heavier, and he felt as if he were about to be crushed by it.

<blank>

The dorm supervisor knocks on the door, puts his hand on the knob as it is, and slowly opens the door.

The dark hallway was lit up by a gentle light coming from the room.

Then, behind the opened door, there she was, sprinkling red jade light.

<blank>

The girl met her there for the first time.
