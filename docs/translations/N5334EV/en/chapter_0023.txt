# 23 - Morning Classroom with Suzy Cloud

The next morning, I woke up healthy, with no particular hoarseness or fatigue.

<blank>

The reason why I was worried about my voice being broken was because I was shouting a lot in the middle of the night, but I cannot reveal what I did because it is forbidden to do so.

But he knows better.

Suzy felt embarrassed when she remembered it again.

<blank>

"Roussei ... today ... no! ...you think... right?"

<blank>

I'm losing confidence...very impatient.

<blank>

I jumped up to shake off my impatience! I jumped up to shake off my impatience.

I slapped my cheeks and opened the window, and breathed in the fresh air, thinking, "Oh, it's a nice morning again today.

<blank>

Immediately, the impatient thoughts fade away, and a healthy mind is restored.

Suzy is quick to change her mind and get back on her feet.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

That morning, Mia visited the Cloud family to pick up Suzy.

<blank>

Good morning, Sue. I'm here to pick you up."

Good morning... Mia?"

<blank>

It seems that Mia took advantage of her proximity to the school to quickly secure Susie, who is often occupied by two upperclassmen.

<blank>

<blank>

I've always wanted to see your house up close. I've always wanted to see it up close.

<blank>

That's what Mia told me as we walked down the hillside in front of the Cloud residence.

For a long time, he had been curious about the unique roof of this Cloud residence.

<blank>

(I just remembered, this is called a "gambrel roof," which is called a "komagata gable roof" because its shape resembles a chess piece!)

<blank>

It's a pretty green gable, isn't it?"

<blank>

I noticed a hiccup.　Kiri-...... gable...? ...... green gable roof?　I looked back at the mansion fearfully.

<blank>

Looking up from the bottom of the hillside, only the roof is clearly visible.

<blank>

Green roof, gable roof, greige ....... Next, he plucks his own hair and checks it again.

<blank>

Redhead: Hetari and his hands on the ground without strength.

<blank>

What's wrong, Sue? Does it hurt somewhere?"

<blank>

Mia rushes to stand by Suzy's side.

<blank>

Oh...oh...oh...my...god...what...what...what...what...what...what...what...what...what...what...what...what!

Are you okay? Sue!"

<blank>

Mia, concerned about Suzy's trembling, called out to her.

<blank>

I... I... I... ahhhhhh!

<blank>

Suddenly, Suzy breaks down in tears, and Mia is flustered.

<blank>

Sue! Are you okay! Are you sick? Let's go home!

<blank>

I am! I am! I am! I'm sorry! To all the Momo Gomery fans around the world! I can't believe that someone like me is in such a ...... position! I can't believe I'm in such a position! Please forgive me! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!  I didn't mean that! I hope someone like me is taken to another dimension through a gable window! Wow!

<blank>

Suzy shakes her head no, and tears like a waterfall are scattered.

<blank>

"Suu, Suu! I don't understand a word you're saying! Hey! Calm down! Let's calm down!

<blank>

Mia pushes Suzy into her ample bosom in an attempt to calm her.

<blank>

Fumiyu!"

<blank>

Suzy fought for a moment, but soon grew quiet.　I'm so happy to be able to ...... fufu fufu fufu fufu yu~~~ I grabbed the soft thing between my face with both hands and rubbed it.

<blank>

Oh! Su, Su-chan...ticklish ......? Aah!

<blank>

She never stops rubbing, moving her hands up and down, pulling them up and away, and continuing to fully enjoy the supreme sensation with her hands and head.

<blank>

"Sue? I'm sorry...? Can I...? Nn! Is it okay? Is it? Ah!

A little bit... more... like this.

I can't help it. ...... nn!"

<blank>

Suzy had completely recovered. She recovered quickly.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy has regained her composure and is walking hand in hand with Mia on her way to school.

They are holding hands because Mia was worried about Suzy and suggested that they hold hands.

<blank>

But I was surprised, wasn't I? "But I was so surprised," he said, "because you suddenly broke down crying. Are you really okay now?

I'm sorry... I remember... a long time ago... a sad... fact... and I'm so sorry... I can't help it... I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... I can't help it...

I'll hold you anytime you feel sad, okay? If it's okay with me, I'll always hold you... right?

Yeah... thanks... Mia... I love you."

<blank>

When Suzy smiled at Mia with her cheeks tinted with a smile, an onomatopoeic sound echoed in Mia's chest.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, you're so cute, Sue! You're so cute, Sue! You're too cute!

Can't I just take it home with me? Is it bad?

<blank>

I had a dangerous thought in my mind, but Suzy had no way of knowing.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I also met Beatrice before arriving at the school.

<blank>

Good morning, you two! Oh, hey. You're here together, aren't you?"

'Good morning, Bibi. Yes, I'm here to pick you up."

"Good morning... Bibi... Bibi too... will you... come... with me... tomorrow?"

<blank>

I tilt my head and ask Beatrice.

<blank>

I'll meet you at the entrance to the boulevard! If we meet at the entrance to the tree-lined avenue, will that save us both the detour?"

<blank>

After a few moments of thought, Beatrice answered.

<blank>

Then... tomorrow... we'll... go... together... right? ...eheh."

What are you doing? You are!"

<blank>

Beatrice pokes Suzy on the cheek, looking not too full. Suzy runs away, laughing.

Mia's cheeks are slightly puffed up as she says, "I'll have less time all to myself.

<blank>

<blank>

Good morning Sue! and two young girls came clothed at the entrance of the school.

<blank>

Good morning... Leila... Mabel.

<blank>

Suzy takes turns rubbing her cheek against their cheeks.

<blank>

<blank>

When I entered the classroom, Colin was already in the room reading a book.

<blank>

As I exchange greetings with Colin, a familiar presence approaches from behind me again from yesterday.

<blank>

(Oh, maybe he liked her after all? Usually boys only roll up their skirts for girls they like...and considering the boy's feelings, I don't want to treat him too badly. ......)

<blank>

As I was thinking this, Stefan approached me and pulled up my skirt from behind as hard as he could.

By the way, today it's the venerable light blue striped pants.

<blank>

Pyaaah!"

<blank>

(Ahh...I know! I'm still a little embarrassed to have my butt exposed. Oh, what? Is this a greeting by any chance? A good morning greeting? A skirt roll-up in lieu of a good morning greeting? Was yesterday's skirt rolled up in lieu of a good-bye? Ah! It's the kind of idea a pure-hearted prankster boy would have...aha.

I'll have to scold him a little bit. (I hope it won't be too bad... maybe a pinprick will do...?)

<blank>

He momentarily performs such a thought, and just before Stephan's forehead, just before he enters the escape position, he quickly puts out his middle finger, which is held in place by his thumb, and lightly - quite lightly by Suzy's standards ～～～～～～ - plays his middle finger.

<blank>

Immediately after, pg! and a tremendous sound rang out, and Stefan was blown to the back of the classroom.

<blank>

Inside the classroom, desks were blown away and pulled back, and the walls where Stephan had hit them creaked and made a high-pitched screeching sound.

The students were wide-eyed and frozen, unable to move an inch.

<blank>

Dana, who was just about to enter the classroom, witnessed Stefan flying in front of her and froze with her eyes wide open as well.

<blank>

Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Stefan! Stefan! All right? All right? All right? I'm all right! Okay!

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy rushes over to Stefan in a panic.

I'm already half crying.

I held Stefan in my arms as I said ahhh.

<blank>

Oh, oh! Are you okay? ... ahhh... ahhh... Uh-uh.

<blank>

Eggy and teary-eyed, Suzy gently puts her hand on Stefan's forehead.

<blank>

What? What? What happened? What?

<blank>

Dana comes to her senses and tries to assess the situation.

<blank>

"Dana... Stefan... are you okay? I'm all right?

<blank>

Suzy looks at me with clinging eyes.

<blank>

Which one? What happened?"

<blank>

When Dana approached Suzy and kneeled down to check on Stefan.

<blank>

<blank>

Stefan's eyes widened with a start and he stood up with a gulp.

<blank>

While everyone else around him was oohing and aahing, Stefan was just thinking, "What was that? What was there? He looked around as if to say, "What happened?

Then, when his eyes met Suzy's tearful ones, he clamped his forehead in his hands, his face turning bright red as he ran out of the classroom.

<blank>

The remaining Suzy can be found at .......

<blank>

"Good...good...good...good...good...good...good...good...good..."

<blank>

I sat down on the floor with a heckler.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Sue, are you okay?"

Nmmm...mmmm...mmmm...okay...mmmm...mmmm..."

<blank>

Now Suzy is clinging to Mia and burying her face in her chest.

It seems that Mia's chest has already established itself as a healing point for Suzy.

<blank>

Goodness gracious, Mia is stroking Susie's head.

<blank>

"My... claws... hurt, didn't they?"

Sue! I don't think that's such a problem!"

"Hm? ...but... the... knuckles... are... too... pitiful... and...

"Sue? I don't think that's what you mean.

I mean, Sue, why did you let her skirt come up without telling me? Couldn't Sue have avoided that?"

Oh, you're an exhibitionist, aren't you? I knew it! Maybe you like to show your butt!"

Chi! Chi! ...no... no..! . ..butt... . ..no! Mon... mon...

Okay, okay, okay, okay! All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right!

No... no... mon.

But Sue, don't you think it's too late to get wound up?"

But... I... didn't... do... anything... wrong... I... think...

Sue said, "Oh, yes, you're right. I think Sue is right. But think about it, Sue. It's okay if it's just a skirt rip...no, it's not okay, but what if it's something that could hurt someone? What if it's something that could hurt someone? What if you don't do anything until they get hurt? Isn't it important to prevent things before they happen?"

Ah.

Sue can do it, right?"

Yes... I understand..! ...from next time... prevention...! Yeah! ...but ... Colin ... you're ... you're ... you're ... you're ... you're ... you're ... you're ... you're ... you're ...

I'll tell you what! You're just out of it!"

"Oh... that... that... you... heard... yesterday, too?"

<blank>

All four nodded in unison.
