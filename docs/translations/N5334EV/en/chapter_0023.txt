# Chapter 23: Suzy Cloud and the Morning Classroom

The next morning, I woke up feeling refreshed, without any hoarseness or fatigue.

<b>

The reason I was worried about my voice being hoarse was that I had shouted loudly all night, but I can't reveal what happened due to a confidentiality clause.

But I understand it well.

When I think back on it, I find it strangely embarrassing, which Suzy thought was troublesome.

<b>

"Roshutsu... kyou... chigau!... omou... yo ne?"

<b>

My confidence started to wane... I was very anxious.

<b>

With a sudden "Eei!" I jumped up as if to shake off my anxiety.

I slapped my cheeks to pump myself up, threw open the window, and took a deep breath of the fresh morning air, thinking, "Ah, it's a nice morning again today."

<b>

Instantly, my anxious feelings disappeared, and I felt a sense of well-being.

Suzy was quick to switch her mindset and recover.

<b>

<b>

<b>

That morning, Mia came to pick up Suzy at the Cloud residence.

<b>

"Good morning, Su-chan. I came to pick you up."

"Good morning... Mia?"

<b>

It seems that Mia took advantage of the fact that Suzy's route to school was close, which often made her occupied by two upperclassmen, and acted quickly to secure her.

<b>

<b>

"Su-chan's house has that cute, jagged roof. I wanted to see it up close for a long time."

<b>

Mia said this while walking down the hill in front of the Cloud residence.

She had been curious about the unique roof of the Cloud residence for quite some time.

<b>

(Oh, I remember now, this is called a 'gambrel roof,' and it's shaped like a shogi piece, which is why it's referred to as 'komagata kiritsuma roof'!)

<b>

"It's a cute green gable, isn't it?"

<b>

I suddenly realized. Gree... gable...? A green gable roof? I cautiously turned back to look at the mansion.

<b>

Since I was looking up from the bottom of the hill, I could see only the roof clearly.

<b>

A green roof, a gable roof, green... Next, I grabbed my hair to confirm again.

<b>

It's red hair. I collapsed weakly onto the ground.

<b>

"W-what's wrong, Su-chan!? Are you in pain?"

<b>

Mia hurriedly rushed to Suzy's side.

<b>

"Ah... ah... wh-what... what is... this!!!"

"Are you okay? Su-chan!"

<b>

Mia, concerned for the trembling Suzy, spoke to her.

<b>

"I... I... aahhh!!!"

<b>

Suddenly, Suzy burst into tears like a waterfall, causing Mia to panic.

<b>

"Su-chan! Are you okay!? Do you feel unwell? Should we go back home!?"

<b>

'What a disaster—!! I am! I am!! I'm sorry! To all the fans of Montgomery around the world!! How can someone like me be in such... such!!! Such a position!! Please forgive me! I'm sorry—!! Gr, Green...!! Ah... red hair!! Uwaaaahhh, I'm so sorry—!!! I didn't mean it!!! Someone like me should just be taken to another dimension through a gable window!!! Uwaaaahhh!!!!'

<b>

Suzy shook her head vigorously, scattering tears like a waterfall.

<b>

"S-Su-chan!? I don't understand your words?! Okay? Calm down! Let's calm down?"

<b>

Mia tried to calm Suzy by hugging her tightly.

<b>

"Fumigyu!"

<b>

Suzy resisted for a moment but soon became docile. Hah, what is this feeling of happiness... it's so soft... I grabbed and squeezed the soft thing that was holding my face with both hands.

<b>

"Ah! S-Su-chan... th-that's... ticklish... you know? Nn!"

<b>

Without stopping her hands, she continued to enjoy that supreme sensation, moving it up and down.

<b>

"Su... chan? Is it... okay? Nn! I think it's okay? Maybe?! Ah!"

"Y-yeah... just a little... like this..."

"Nn, well, I guess I have no choice... Nn!"

<b>

Suzy had completely recovered. She was quick to bounce back.

<b>

<b>

Having regained her composure, Suzy walked hand in hand with Mia on the way to school.

They were holding hands because Mia was worried about Suzy and suggested they walk together.

<b>

"But I was surprised, you know? You suddenly started crying. Are you really okay now?"

"Nn... I'm sorry... I remembered... a sad... fact from the past... and I couldn't bear it... but... I'm okay... right?"

"I see... If you ever feel sad, just tell me, okay? If it's okay with me, I'll always hold you."

"Yeah... thank you... Mia... I love you."

<b>

Suzy smiled at Mia with rosy cheeks, and in Mia's heart, a sound of "Kyuuuuun" echoed.

<b>

<b>

Ah! Su-chan is so cute! Too cute!!

Is it okay to take her home like this? Is it not okay?!

<b>

While I was having such dangerous thoughts, Suzy had no way of knowing.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Just before arriving at school, they also met Beatrice.

<b>

"Good morning, you two! Oh? You came together?"

"Good morning, Bibi-chan. That's right, I went to pick her up."

"Good morning... Bibi... are you going to... join us... tomorrow?"

<b>

I tilted my head and asked Beatrice.

<b>

"...Well, if we meet at the entrance of the tree-lined path, we can avoid making you two take a detour, right?"

<b>

After a moment of thought, Beatrice replied.

<b>

"Then... tomorrow... the three of us... together... okay! ...Ehe."

"Why are you so happy about it!? You!"

<b>

Beatrice poked Suzy's cheek with a not-so-unpleasant expression, and Suzy laughed and ran away.

Mia puffed her cheeks a little, thinking that her alone time was decreasing.

<b>

<b>

"Good morning, Su-chan!" Two younger girls clung to Suzy at the school entrance.

<b>

"Good morning... Layla... Mabel."

<b>

Suzy rubbed her cheek against each of the two girls alternately.

<b>

<b>

When they entered the classroom, Colin was already reading a book inside.

<b>

As I exchanged greetings with Colin, I sensed a familiar presence approaching from behind, just like yesterday.

<b>

(Ah, I wonder if I've been liked? Normally, boys only lift skirts of girls they like... Considering a boy's feelings, I don't want to do anything too harsh...)

<b>

While thinking about this, Stefan came up from behind and lifted my skirt with all his might.

By the way, today I'm wearing the traditional light blue striped panties.

<b>

"Upyah!"

<b>

(Ah! If my butt is exposed, it might be embarrassing. Ah, wait? Is this a greeting? A morning greeting? A skirt lift as a greeting? Was yesterday's lift a farewell gesture? Ah! What a pure-hearted prankster's thought... Ah ha.

Well, I guess I should scold him a bit? I shouldn't be too harsh... Is a flick on the forehead okay...?)

<b>

I quickly thought this through, and just before Stefan went into escape mode, I swiftly flicked my middle finger, which was held down by my thumb, lightly—very lightly, according to Suzy's standards—against his forehead.

<b>

Immediately afterward, a loud "PAGOOOON!" echoed, and Stefan was blown to the back of the classroom.

<b>

Desks were overturned, and the wall Stefan hit creaked, making a sound like a high-pitched scream.

The students were wide-eyed and frozen, unable to move.

<b>

Dana, who was just about to enter the classroom, also witnessed Stefan flying in front of her and froze with wide eyes.

<b>

"Ah! Ah! Ah! ...S-Stefan! ...Are you okay!? ...Safe!? ...Are you okay!? ...Hey? ...Are you okay!? ...Ah!"

<b>

<b>

Suzy rushed over to Stefan in a panic.

She was already half in tears.

She was saying "Aah, aah" while holding Stefan.

<b>

"Ah, ah! ...Are you okay? ...Ah, ugh... are you fine? ...Ugh."

<b>

With tears welling up, Suzy gently placed her hand on Stefan's forehead.

<b>

"W-what? Huh? What happened? Huh?"

<b>

Dana seemed to come to her senses and tried to assess the situation.

<b>

"Dana... is Stefan... okay? ...I wonder?"

<b>

Suzy looked at her with pleading eyes.

<b>

"What? What happened?"

<b>

As Dana approached Suzy and knelt down to check on Stefan's condition.

<b>

Suddenly, Stefan opened his eyes wide and jumped up.

<b>

Ignoring the surrounding gasps of "Whoa," Stefan looked around as if to say, "Huh? What happened?"

And when his eyes met Suzy's tear-filled ones, he quickly pressed both hands to his forehead, turning bright red, and dashed out of the classroom.

<b>

Left behind, Suzy...

<b>

"Y-yeah, I'm glad... I'm glad... safe... I'm glad..."

<b>

She collapsed weakly onto the floor.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Are you okay, Su-chan?"

"Nn... I'm... okay... m-myu."

<b>

Right now, Suzy was clinging to Mia, burying her face in her chest.

It seemed that Mia's chest had already established itself as a healing point for Suzy.

<b>

Mia gently stroked Suzy's head.

<b>

"Did your... nails... hurt... maybe?"

"Su! I don't think that's the main issue!"

"Nn? ...But... the fist... is... poor..."

"Su-chan? I don't think that's the case either?"

"Basically, Su, why did you let him lift your skirt without saying anything? You could have avoided it, right?"

"Ah! So you are an exhibitionist? You like showing your butt, don't you?!"

"N-No! ...That's not it! ...My butt... is different! ...!"

"I-I got it! I understand, so calm down!"

"....It's different...!"

"But Su-chan, I think it's too late after your skirt has been lifted, don't you?"

"....But... I didn't... do anything... I don't think it's wrong to scold him..."

"Ah, that's true, I think what Su says is correct. But think about it, Su. It's good that this is just a skirt lift, but... no, it's not good, really. What if someone got hurt? Would you wait until someone got hurt? Isn't it important to prevent things before they happen?"

"....Ah."

"You can do it, right?"

"Yeah... I understand! ...I'll prevent it... next time!! ...Yeah! ...But... Colin... is really... amazing!"

"So! You're just the one who's lacking!"

"Ugh... I heard that... yesterday... too...?"

<b>

The four of them nodded in agreement.
