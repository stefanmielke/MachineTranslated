# Chapter 66: The Escape of Jules Narl

“Damn it! Hey! You lot! Go grab that girl! You can be a bit rough, but don’t leave any marks! Got it!!”

<b>

Cameron Fourier, showing no signs of hiding his irritation, barked orders at the five guards he had brought along.

<b>

“The rest come with me for protection! We’re heading back to Corptown! You lot bring the girl there!!”

<b>

Fourier quickly rattled off these instructions and immediately headed down the corridor toward his room.

<b>

Of the five men, two exchanged glances and quickly followed Fourier.

Another two men nodded at each other with smirks and headed in the opposite direction.

<b>

The last remaining man, Jules Narl, furrowed his brow, scratching his fallen cheek with his right hand, and looked up at the ceiling with his droopy eyes.

<b>

This is no good.

When told to grab the young girl, he had turned his body toward the two who had gone off with a grin, but it felt as if he were blocked by a massive, thick steel wall, and he had no motivation to move forward.

Even when he tried to follow Fourier, it felt as if his feet were shackled by heavy chains, and they wouldn’t budge.

<b>

Am I stuck?

<b>

Scratching his round nose, he let out a big sigh, murmuring in frustration.

<b>

<b>

Jules Narl had been living in the back alleys of society since he could remember. He didn’t even know the faces of his parents or siblings.

He had done anything to survive.

Harming and stealing from others was a matter of course.

He felt no pangs of conscience about it.

<b>

It was no different from wild animals preying on other creatures.

For him, that was simply living.

<b>

The reason he had managed to survive in such a perilous life, akin to that of wild animals in human society, was due to his absolute ability to sense danger.

<b>

Paths he must never tread.

Choices he must never make.

<b>

By always trusting that divine warning emanating from within himself, he had managed to survive until today.

<b>

<b>

<b>

When he took on this bodyguard job, he thought it would be quite an easy task.

In reality, it was enough to be surrounded by the knight order and protect the inside. There was no way anyone could breach the knight’s wall.

There was hardly anything to do while on the move.

Most of the time, he enjoyed himself inside the carriage, which was hidden from view.

<b>

In the first place, the true job of this employer was to guide and protect him when he went to enjoy the underground places in various towns during his travels.

<b>

Since the employer had quite a good taste, the establishments that suited his preferences ended up being illegal places in deeper areas.

Naturally, there was no way to bring the knight order along as protection, let alone guide them, so it became their turn to act.

<b>

This employer seemed to have a particular fondness for tormenting young girls, and satisfying such a kink inevitably led them far away from legitimate businesses.

Despite having such tastes, he was overly concerned about appearances.

<b>

At one point, he even said that he had to strangle something during the act because he was seen in a well-lit area. He also told them to take care of the cleanup afterward.

They had to negotiate for compensation for damages with the store and handle the disposal as well.

Jules Narl thought to himself, how much more the ones in power can do as they please, while processing the body of the girl who had become a silent witness.

He felt no aversion or guilt about such tasks. To him, it was just another mundane job.

Cleaning up after the employer and covering his tracks; most of the work on this journey had been like this.

<b>

Of course, he also did his job as a bodyguard properly.

Having survived in the underworld from the beginning, he had considerable confidence in his skills.

<b>

By acting alongside the knight order, he could gauge their abilities as well.

He could handle members of the order without any issue. Even if surrounded by several, he could likely break through the encirclement. He could manage even with squad leaders.

However, that brigade commander and vice-commander were on a different level.

<b>

Such monsters were not seen every day.

Unless they were bodyguards for some major player in the underworld or hitmen, he couldn’t deal with them.

Even he, who had faced many strong opponents, felt a power that made him think he could never match them.

<b>

<b>

But more shocking than that was the Amkam.

<b>

What on earth are the residents here?

<b>

For a long time, there had been talk of Amkam among the underworld dwellers.

<b>

Don’t mess with the Amkam.

If you ever find yourself in a situation with them, run without hesitation.

They are untouchable. Don’t think you can do anything with numbers or weapons. Stay away from them!

<b>

He had occasionally heard such phrases, but they were mostly during drinking sessions. He had taken them with a grain of salt.

<b>

However, upon actually coming to Amkam, he realized that it was neither a metaphor nor an exaggeration.

Anyone walking around there was clearly stronger than a squad leader.

His instincts blared alarms, warning him to stay away from them.

Among them, there were several who seemed far more monstrous than that vice-commander or brigade commander.

<b>

He wondered how aware the others he was working with were of this.

At least two seemed to sense some kind of discomfort. Those with sharp instincts tend to live longer in this world.

<b>

But the other two were hopeless.

They were still treating the maids here the same way they had in the mansion where they had been employed in another town.

The maids deftly avoided their hands without being touched.

The two men merely tilted their heads, unaware they were being dodged.

The maids here were also quite the monsters. Those who couldn’t even notice such things would undoubtedly not live long.

<b>

Even now, they laughed as they headed to kidnap the lord’s daughter, thinking it was an easy job.

<b>

Are they idiots? 

<b>

An easy job? No way!

On the surface, they might seem like ordinary girls, but she is the biggest monster in this village!

The fact that she gives off no aura of a strong person is even more unsettling.

<b>

And those eyes!

Those cobalt green eyes, like the sea, seemed to connect to an unfathomably deep ocean.

Just a glance from those eyes made him feel as if they were peering deep into his soul.

<b>

He couldn’t see the bottom of her depths at all.

<b>

Yet those guys… those who cannot see are truly fortunate.

It would be far safer to dive into the lair of the Queen Hydra and collect some eggs than to mess with her!

Those who don’t understand that are already done for.

The employer who gave that order won’t last long either.

<b>

Going forward is no good. Going back is also the end. I’m really stuck. This is it.

<b>

If both front and back are no good, I have no choice but to take another path.

<b>

Jules Narl opened the window in front of him, wrapped his slender body in his cloak, and silently left the Amkam House.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The drug they were about to use was a paralyzing poison.

It was a type of muscle relaxant.

It was a powerful drug, but it was also highly volatile, and if used outside, it would hardly be effective unless directly applied to the face.

<b>

However, indoors, the effect could be expected to be sufficient.

Given the width of this corridor, if they threw the container of the drug at their feet and scattered its contents, a space of about one meter in radius would be filled with the drug’s effect for nearly 30 seconds.

If they protected their mouths with a damp towel, they could prevent the drug, but hardly anyone would think of such a thing in a pinch. One breath would be the end.

<b>

Well, even if by some chance the drug was dodged, they could just threaten with a blade.

The lord’s daughter… a girl from a good family could be dealt with quickly with just a bit of violence. It was truly an easy job.

Since the order was not to leave any marks, it would be quick if the drug worked.

<b>

The two men huddled around the corner of the corridor and peeked into the passage beyond.

Just then, the target girl was approaching with a maid.

The two men exchanged glances, nodded, covered their mouths with masks, and threw the container of the drug at the target’s feet.

The distance to the target was less than 10 meters. They started running at the same time they threw the drug bottle.

The container shattered right at the target’s feet as intended.

A colorless, odorless gas overflowed, and the effect should manifest almost instantly.

<b>

The men ran toward their respective targets, the girl and the maid. They intended to catch their bodies to prevent any loud noise when they fell due to the drug’s effect.

<b>

However, there was no sign that the drug was working on the targets.

The girl stopped, looking down at the broken container at her feet, but her consciousness remained intact.

<b>

The two men gaped in surprise at the fact that the drug had no effect, but they quickly drew their knives from their waists and thrust them forward.

Somewhere, there might have been a shift in the air that they couldn’t perceive, causing the drug to dissipate before it could take effect.

If one cannot adapt to a sudden situation, they cannot call themselves professionals.

The men decided to use the most straightforward and effective means of making them comply: violence.

<b>

They ran low toward their respective targets.

The man heading toward the girl held a knife in his right hand, spread his left hand to block her path, and charged forward.

He intended to scoop her up, cover her mouth with his hand, and press the knife to her throat.

<b>

Just as his foot kicked the floor, and it seemed he could reach the girl, she raised her left hand, and he felt her fingertips touch his right hand that held the knife.

In that instant, the man’s consciousness was blown away.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

With a sound like a whirl, the man’s body spun like a top, slicing through the air at high speed.

Immediately after, a sound like something bursting echoed in the area.

<b>

The man who had approached Suzy, with his right hand holding the knife, was blown outward as if his arm were being yanked, and his body was dragged along with that momentum, spinning rapidly and crashing into the wall.

<b>

His right arm bent in an unnatural shape, and his entire body was plastered against the wall like a squashed frog.

His face might have been crushed, but he seemed to be barely alive.

<b>

“Fragile!? Why? Why? I used the Friendly Finger like I did with Stefan, didn’t I?”

<b>

Suzy tilted her head, expressing her bewilderment at the situation.

She seemed to think she was being cute, but the gruesome scene remained unchanged.

<b>

“My lady… it is a mistake to treat the people of Amkam and outsiders as equals.”

“Is that so? Hmm… is that so…?”

<b>

Anna Mary admonished Suzy, but Suzy, showing no signs of remorse, continued to tilt her head in confusion.

She thought, it’s their fault anyway.

She felt no pangs of conscience or pain toward the man who was now a pitiful sight stuck to the wall.

After all, he was someone who had attacked her with unpleasant malice directed not only at her but even at Anna Mary.

There was no reason to show any kindness or restraint.

<b>

On the other hand, the man who had approached Anna Mary was being pinned down by her foot.

The man at her feet, who should have been holding a knife, had his right arm bent as if another joint had formed from his upper arm, pressed against the floor by Anna Mary’s foot.

His face, pressed down to the floor, was turned white, frothing at the mouth, and he seemed to have long lost consciousness.

<b>

<b>

The paralyzing poison that had been dispersed had already evaporated, losing its toxicity.

Suzy noticed that some kind of poison had been sprayed, but before she could even think about it, her body had already resisted the poison.

There was no way such a low-grade poison could affect Suzy’s body.

<b>

Furthermore, Anna Mary was nearby, and there was no sign that the poison had affected her either.

<b>

“Anna Mary. I thought poison had been sprayed… are you alright?!”

“Thank you for your concern, my lady. However, there is no need to worry. I have been trained since childhood to have resistance to all kinds of poisons, so this level of paralyzing poison has no effect on me.”

“...Ah, I see.”

<b>

She thought perhaps Anna Mary had taken some kind of countermeasure, but it felt like she had just casually said something impressive.

It was amazing that she could identify that as paralyzing poison so easily… What kind of early childhood education does the Bylos family provide?!

What on earth are they trying to raise?!

Suzy’s cheeks twitched as she pondered this.

<b>

While she was thinking about such things, Anna Mary clapped her hands.

<b>

“I just instructed to clean up this filth. I ended up taking unnecessary time, but my lady, let’s hurry to your room.”

<b>

While Anna Mary was saying this to Suzy, several maids silently gathered at the scene.

As Anna Mary waved her hand lightly toward the men, the maids began to carry the men away with fluid movements, cleaning up the dirty floor and walls.

<b>

“Now, my lady, let’s leave this to these girls. We must hurry.”

“...Yes, Anna Mary, let’s hurry. We need to prepare quickly!!”

“The purpose and mastermind behind these individuals can be entrusted to these girls without worry. They will do a good job, so you can rest assured… Well, it’s obvious who is behind this, but testimony is necessary… ufufufu.”

“...Ah, I see…”

<b>

Suzy, slightly twitching at Anna Mary’s faint smile, took her hand and hurried toward the Amkam House’s private room.
