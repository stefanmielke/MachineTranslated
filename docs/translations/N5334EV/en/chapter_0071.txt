# 66 Jules Nard's Escape

Damn! Oi! You guys! Go get that girl! You can be a little rough with her, but don't hurt her! But don't hurt her! Yes, sir!

<blank>

Cameron Fourier made no attempt to hide his irritation, and gave orders to the five guards he had brought with him in a foul-mouthed manner.

<blank>

The rest of you come with me and escort me! We're going back to Copetown! You two bring my daughter back there!

<blank>

Houlihan said this quickly, and then immediately headed down the aisle in the direction of his room.

<blank>

Two of the five men looked at each other and immediately followed Fourier.

Two more men nodded to each other, fishing the corners of their mouths, and headed in the opposite direction.

<blank>

Jules Nard, the last one left, was furrowing his brow, scratching his own calloused cheek with the fingers of his right hand, looking up at the ceiling with wide, droopy eyes.

<blank>

I can't help it.

When I turned my body toward them, grinning at the thought of an easy job, I felt as if I were being blocked by a huge, thick wall of steel, and I had no desire to move my body forward.

I tried to follow Fourier, but my legs seemed to be trapped in a heavy chain and would not move forward.

<blank>

Is this a dead end?

<blank>

He scratched his round nose and sighed heavily, as if he was troubled.

<blank>

<blank>

Jules Nard has been on the backstreets of society for as long as he can remember. He does not even know the faces of his parents and siblings.

We did whatever we had to do to survive.

Harming and robbing others. It was a natural act.

I don't particularly have a conscience about it.

<blank>

It is no different than wild animals preying on other animals.

For him, it was a way of life.

<blank>

He had been living a life as swarthy as a wild animal in human society, but he has survived until today because of his absolute ability to sense danger.

<blank>

A path that should never be taken.

A choice that should never be made.

<blank>

He has survived to this day by always believing in the divine warnings that emanate from within him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I took this escort job, I thought it would be a very easy job.

In fact, it is enough to be surrounded by the Knights and protect the inside of them. There is no way that anyone can transcend the walls of the knighthood.

There is little to do on the move.

Most of the time, I was in a carriage that could not be seen from the outside, and I was entertained in my own way.

<blank>

In the first place, it was really their job to guide and escort their employers on their travels to the under-the-radar places of amusement in the cities they were in.

<blank>

The employer has moderately good taste, so the stores that suit his taste end up being illegal stores in deeper places.

Naturally, there was no way they could escort the knights, much less guide them, so it was up to them.

<blank>

This employer seems to have a great fondness for shagging young boys, and satisfying such a proclivity inevitably takes him far away from his official place of business.

Despite such a habit, he cares more than necessary only about the world.

<blank>

On one occasion, he told me that he had strangled himself during the act because he had been seen with his face in a lighted place. He also told me to clean up the mess.

They also negotiated with the store for compensation for the damage and disposal of the product.

Jules Nard was laughing as he processed the body of his daughter, who had become a mute figure.

Jules Nard does not feel evasive or guilty about this kind of work. For him, it is just another ordinary task.

Cleaning up after their employers and cleaning up after themselves. Most of the work on this trip was like this.

<blank>

Of course, we did a good job of escorting them.

He had lived through the underworld from the beginning. He had a lot of confidence in his skills.

<blank>

I worked with the Knights and was able to estimate their competence with them.

The group class can handle it with no problem. Even if they are surrounded by several people, they will be able to get out of the encirclement. Even the group leader class will have no problem.

But that battalion commander and his XO were something else.

<blank>

I don't see those monsters.

Unless you are a bodyguard of a big shot in the underworld, or a scavenger, you can't take on this guy.

Even he, who had faced many strong men, felt a power that made him feel that he was beyond his reach.

<blank>

<blank>

But even more shocking was the amcam.

<blank>

What in the world is it with these people?

<blank>

For a long time, there has been talk of Amcam from the mouths of underdog residents.

<blank>

Don't mess with the guys from Amcam.

If you are about to get into a fight with them, don't hesitate to run away without looking aside.

They are untouchable. Don't think you have the numbers or the weapons to stop them. Don't get involved with them!

<blank>

I had heard such lines from time to time, but usually at the drinking table. I listened to them halfheartedly.

<blank>

But when I actually came to AMCAM, I realized that it was neither a metaphor nor an exaggeration.

The guy walking around there is clearly stronger than the group leader class.

My own sense of smell is ringing off the hook, telling me to stay away from those people.

Some of them were far more monstrous than that XO and battalion commander.

<blank>

I wonder to what extent the people they are hired with are aware of this...

At least two of them seem to feel some kind of discomfort. The person with such a keen sense of smell will live longer in this world.

<blank>

But not the other two.

He was messing around with the maids here in the same sense as in the mansions where he had been taken care of by his employer in other cities.

The maids were not touched by them, and they were able to avoid their hands with natural movements.

They just tilt their heads and don't even think they're losing.

The maids here are a kind of monster. These people who don't even notice such things definitely won't live long.

<blank>

Even now, he was laughing as he headed off, saying that kidnapping the lords' daughters was an easy job.

<blank>

Are they idiots? Are they?

<blank>

You think it's an easy job? No kidding!

On the surface, she may look like any other little girl, but she is the biggest monster in this village!

The fact that there is no sign of the strongman at all makes it all the more eerie.

<blank>

And those eyes!

Those ocean-like cobalt green eyes seemed to lead to the bottom of an unbelievably deep ocean.

Just one glance with those eyes made me feel as if I was being looked into the depths of my soul.

<blank>

Like those endlessly deep eyes, I can't see the bottom of my daughter's head.

<blank>

And yet, those people...those who can't see things are very lucky.

If you want to mess with that thing, it is much more likely to survive if you dive into the Queen Hydra's den and pick up some eggs!

Those guys who don't understand that are finished.

The employer who directed it also has no future first.

<blank>

You go forward, but no. Going backwards ends. I'm still stuck. This is the tide.

<blank>

If neither the front nor the back works, we have no choice but to go our separate ways.

<blank>

Jules Nard opened the window in front of him, wrapped his slender body in his cloak, and left the Amcam House without a sound.

<blank>

<blank>

The drug they were going to use was a paralyzing poison.

They are the so-called muscle relaxants.

It is a powerful drug, but it is also highly volatile, so if it were to be used outside, it would have to be applied directly to the face to have any effect.

<blank>

But indoors, the effect can be quite effective.

With the size of this corridor, if a container of medicine is thrown at a person's feet and its contents scatter, a space with a radius of about one meter should be filled with the effects of the medicine for less than 30 seconds.

Protecting the mouth with a damp towel would have prevented the drug, but not many people would have thought of that on the spur of the moment. A breath of air is all it takes.

<blank>

Well, if by any chance the drugs were to be lost, it would only be a matter of threatening them with a knife.

A daughter of a lord...a little girl from a good family...a little show of violence and it's over in a jiffy. It's an easy job.

The order was not to damage the body, so it would be quicker if the medicine would take care of the problem.

<blank>

They huddled in the corner of the aisle and peeked down the other side.

The target's daughter was just on her way here with her maid.

The two men looked at each other, nodded, covered their mouths with masks, and tossed a container of pills at the target's feet.

The distance to the target is less than 10 meters. He starts running at the same time as he throws the medicine bottle.

The container broke like a bullet at the target's feet, just as he wanted.

A flood of colorless, odorless gas should appear and take effect almost instantly.

<blank>

The men run toward their respective targets, the daughter and the maid. When the drug takes effect and they fall into a coma, they intend to catch their bodies in order to prevent them from making a loud noise when they fall.

<blank>

But the drugs don't seem to be working on the targets.

My daughter stops and looks down at the broken container at her feet, but her consciousness remains normal.

<blank>

The two men were blindsided by the fact that the drug had no effect, but they immediately ran, pulled out knives from their waists, and held them out.

Somewhere, there was a movement in the air that could not be detected from here, and it may have dissipated faster than the medicine took effect.

If you can't stand up to a situation on the spur of the moment, you are not a professional.

The men decided to use the simplest and most effective means of getting them to do what they said by violence.

<blank>

They ran low toward their respective targets.

The man facing his daughter has a knife in his right hand and his left hand outstretched as he lunges forward to block her path.

He intends to hold her in place, cover her mouth with his hand, and then hold the knife to her throat.

<blank>

Her legs kicked the floor, and just when it seemed she could reach her daughter, she raised her lowered left hand and felt the tips of her fingers touch her own right hand, which was holding the knife.

At that moment, the man's consciousness was blown away.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The man's body spun at super-speed like a top, slicing through the air.

Immediately afterward, a popping sound like something exploding echoed through the place.

<blank>

The man's right hand, which was holding the knife, was blown outward, and his body was dragged by his arm, which spun him around at high speed and sent him crashing into the wall.

<blank>

His right arm was bent into an insane shape, and his entire body resembled a squashed frog, clinging to the wall.

His face may have been crushed, but he barely seems to be alive.

<blank>

Brittle! Nande? Why? Did you use your friendly finger like you do to Stefan, hmm?"

<blank>

Susie tilted her head and said that this was indeed a puzzling situation.

They think they are being cute, but the devastation is still the same.

<blank>

Miss ......, it is a mistake to equate those in Amkam with those outside."

Really?" Oooooooo ......, yeah, right, ......?"

<blank>

AnnaMarie tried to warn Susie, but Susie did not seem offended and kept tilting her head curiously.

They are the ones who are at fault.

There is no remorse, no pain, no remorse at all for the man who is slumped against the wall, exposed to the cruelty of the situation.

The one who had originally attacked AnnaMarie, not to mention himself, with unpleasant and harmful intentions.

There is no reason to go easy on them.

<blank>

Meanwhile, the man who went to AnnaMarie was trampled under her feet.

The man at his feet has his right arm, which should have been holding a knife, bent as if it had another joint from the second arm, and is being pushed and stomped on his back by AnnaMarie's foot.

Pressed face down on the floor, his face is white-eyed and bubbling, and he seems to have long since given up consciousness.

<blank>

<blank>

The paralytic poison that was sprayed has already volatilized and lost its toxicity.

Suzy was aware that some kind of poison had been sprayed, but before she was aware of it, her body had already resisted the poison.

There is no way that a poison of this low level would have any effect on Susie's body.

<blank>

Furthermore, AnnaMarie was also nearby, but there was no indication that the poison had worked on her either.

<blank>

AnnaMary. I'm sure the poison was sprayed on ......, but are you ok, are you ok?

Thank you for your concern, Miss. But there is no need to worry. I have been trained from an early age to be resistant to all poisons, so a paralyzing poison of this magnitude would have no effect on me.

"...... Oh, yes, I see."

<blank>

I asked him about it, thinking that perhaps he was taking some kind of action, but I felt like he casually said something great.

It's amazing that you can so easily figure out that it was a paralyzing poison. ...... What kind of early childhood education do they have? What about the Byros family?

What on earth are you going to raise?

Suzy's cheeks twitched at the thought.

<blank>

As I was thinking about this, AnnaMarie clapped her hands in a pompous manner.

<blank>

I have just instructed you to clean up this mess. I'm sorry to have wasted your time, but, miss, let's hurry up and head to your room."

<blank>

While AnnaMarie was saying these words to Susie, several maids gathered there without a sound.

AnnaMarie waved her hand at the men, and the maids took them out in a fluid motion and began cleaning up the dirty floors and walls.

<blank>

Now, my dear lady, let's leave the matter to these girls. We must hurry as quickly as possible."

......Yes, AnnaMarie, hurry up, let's hurry up and get ready! Hurry up and get ready!

You can be sure that these girls will know what these people are up to and who is behind it. Don't worry, they will do a good job, you can rest assured. ...... Well, it's obvious who's behind it, but we need testimonies. ......

"......, or ............."

<blank>

Suzy, slightly twitching at AnnaMarie's thin smile, took her up and walked briskly to her room at the Amcam House.
