# Chapter 27: Amukamu's Summer Vacation Part 1

Let me explain the world view a little.

----------------

<b>

I had heard the name Ravi several times before.

<b>

Some of the people who saw me for the first time instinctively mentioned it.

At first, I didn't think much of it, but when several people brought it up, it started to bother me.

<b>

<b>

I thought I would ask Rider-san about it this time, but I never expected to see such a pained expression on his face.

<b>

This matter doesn't seem like something I should casually poke my nose into.

It would be a lie to say I'm not curious, but if my imagination is correct, my desire to know might end up saddening Sonia Mama and Howard Papa... then there's no need to force myself to find out.

<b>

I'll leave it to fate; if the time comes to know, then I'll understand then, right?

From now on, I think I'll refrain from taking any action myself.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The day after that joint sparring session, the graduation ceremony went smoothly, and we entered summer vacation just like that.

<b>

After sparring in the training grounds, I asked Sonia Mama if there were any training clothes I could use in the training grounds, and she brought out some loose pants and a V-neck shirt.

<b>

Since entering summer vacation, I've been running around the village every morning in this outfit.

Running is fundamental for body control, after all.

I want to instill the right amount of strength into my body while varying the intensity of my kicks against the ground.

<b>

Also, since I take the course along the path by the forest, I never forget to sense the presence in the woods every morning.

<b>

When I return from running, Howard-san is always practicing his swordsmanship in the garden.

<b>

He moves the sword with quiet breathing, sometimes slowly and sometimes quickly, confirming each form.

<b>

<b>

Since I have never formally learned how to use a sword, I asked Howard-san if he could teach me this time...

<b>

"Suzy wields a sword far beyond what I can teach. There’s nothing I can impart to you."

"But... I... have never learned... so I'm just... moving... with the sword... as it is..."

"In that case, even more so. What we aim for is a sword that moves naturally without forcing it, both for people and the world. To teach you, who is already at that level, with my half-baked swordsmanship would only disrupt your fine technique."

<b>

With that, I was declined any sword instruction from Howard-san.

<b>

However, that doesn't mean I can't watch Howard-san's training!

<b>

So every morning after returning from my run and taking a shower, I quietly watch Howard Papa's training!

<b>

<b>

Howard-san's sword techniques are powerful and graceful.

<b>

Every time he swings the sword and steps forward, all the muscles in his body tense and come alive.

<b>

Sweat drips off and the steam rising from his body swirls around him like a mirage.

<b>

His powerful sword strokes leave flashes of light reflecting the morning sun, creating multiple beams of light around Howard-san.

<b>

<b>

Howard-san's sword techniques are cool and very beautiful.

I have come to love the time I spend quietly watching him.

Handing a towel to Howard Papa after his training is also an important role for me.

<b>

When I hand him the towel, Howard-san receives it with a genuinely happy expression.

Seeing that face makes me incredibly happy too.

<b>

With that happy feeling, Howard-san heads for his morning shower, and I go to prepare breakfast.

This is a moment of the Cloud household in the morning.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After breakfast, it's time for cleaning the mansion and doing laundry.

<b>

Cleaning involves sweeping, wiping, and polishing, which are basic tasks, but until now, Elrose-san was in charge of the second floor, and Sonia-san was in charge of the first floor.

This was to prevent Sonia Mama's legs from being burdened by going up and down the stairs.

<b>

Now that I'm here, I’m allowed to take care of both the first and second floors, focusing on the areas around the stairs.

<b>

After all, I'm young! I can move around!!

<b>

However, if I rush and leave some spots uncleaned or unwiped, I get caught by Elrose-san's strict checks... ah!

<b>

Laundry is the same; since there’s no washing machine, everything is done by hand! If I apply too much force, the fabric gets damaged; if I don't apply enough, the dirt doesn't come out, and I end up having to redo it several times.

Elrose-san is indeed a strict person, just as I imagined!

<b>

For about two hours after breakfast, I spend every day helping with housework under strict guidance.

Heh heh heh, I can feel my feminine skills improving day by day!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After helping with housework, I go to the temple almost every day.

At the temple, I receive teachings primarily about the customs and social norms of this country, which I lack the most.

<b>

I often spend time with Mia and Vivi at the temple.

Both of them are here to study magic.

<b>

I meet these two almost every day during summer vacation.

In the mornings at the temple, and in the afternoons, if we're free, we usually spend time together.

I spend overwhelmingly more time with Mia... but wait? I might not have missed a day without meeting her...

Since Professor Daisy is also at the temple, I am very grateful to be taught reading and writing as well.

<b>

<b>

Thanks to that, my knowledge about this country has been increasing.

<b>

First, the date and time.

Right now, it is the 4th month of the year 2418 in the Dragon Star Calendar.

A year has 365 days, and a month has either 30 or 31 days, with the blue and red months alternating up to the 6th month.

<b>

In other words, a year has 12 months.

A week has 7 days.

A day has 24 hours.

It's almost the same as modern Japan.

<b>

By the way, the reason there are blue and red months is that... there are two moons orbiting this planet, one blue and one red.

These moons orbit each other while revolving around this planet, like binary stars.

<b>

<b>

In other words, the positions of the blue and red moons alternate in front and behind each month.

The red moon is slightly smaller than the blue moon, so even when the red moon is in front, the outline of the blue moon can still be seen.

That's why during the blue moon, the date is said to be one day longer.

<b>

<b>

Actually, just the other day, the red moon was in front, and the two moons overlapped, and then there was even a total lunar eclipse.

In other words, a rare celestial show occurred where the sun, this planet, and the two moons aligned in a straight line, something that happens once every hundred years or so.

<b>

Hmm... I feel like I missed something precious...

Not being able to see it makes me feel like I lost out!

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, regarding the currency in this country, the smallest unit is called "c."

<b>

Coins come in 1, 5, 10, and 25 copper coins.

50, 100, 250, and 500 silver coins.

From 1000 kuplu, it changes to a unit called "a" and becomes gold coins.

<b>

Aul gold coins come in three types: 1, 5, and 50.

In addition, there are two types of Aurora banknotes, 10 and 100, which are bills.

<b>

The size and thickness of the coins increase as their value increases, so you can tell just by touching them.

A 50 Aul coin is quite large, so it's too big for me to hold in my hand.

<b>

By the way, while I said that kuplu is the smallest unit, there are actually iron coins called "stan" below the copper kuplu.

This is 100s for 1c. It seems to be used mostly for children's allowance.

The currency above the copper kuplu is issued by the country, but the iron coins are made by local governments. Therefore, they cannot be used in other areas.

<b>

As for the currency value, I think 1 Aul is about 10,000 yen in Japan? This is just my subjective feeling...

However, the Cloud household said that with 11a, it is enough to live for a month. So it doesn't seem to fit the value standards of modern Japan.

<b>

<b>

As a side note, in Amukamu, the fur and bones of the magical beasts hunted can be bought by the village.

The village processes and sells them to supplement the operating costs of the civil guard.

<b>

The boa and wolf that Howard-san and I hunted the other day were magical beasts from a relatively deep middle layer, so the purchase price was high, and the boa alone was said to be around 17-18a.

Snake skin is indeed expensive!

<b>

Wolf pelts are also rare if they are undamaged, and one was said to be around 12-13a.

<b>

In the end, I was stunned when I was handed over more than 100a for the severed wolf.

<b>

I said it was too much, but I was laughed at, saying that if it were sold in the royal capital, it would be traded for more than ten times that amount, so it wasn't too much at all. But that's not the point!

<b>

Since I'm being taken care of, I need to make sure Howard-san receives it!

Taking care of living expenses is a privilege of guardians, so it's not something a child should worry about.

<b>

There were various discussions, but in the end, it was settled that I would use it for my school fees, and Howard-san would keep the rest saved until I become an adult.

<b>

I asked him to take the money for the clothes I bought before going to school from this, and... he said with a sad face, "Please don't take away my enjoyment of buying Suzy's clothes."

<b>

Ugh... Seeing Howard Papa make that face makes it hard for me to stand my ground...

<b>

By the way, the reason the purchase price was around 100a for 12-13a for 10 bodies is that a part of the wolf and boa pelts is being used to make my hunting gear!

It seems it will be completed during summer vacation, so I think it will be ready soon.

I'm looking forward to it! I hope it's cool gear!

<b>

<b>

One shocking fact I learned is that the Cloud household is actually from a family of border barons.

<b>

Surprising, right? If it were in a different world, Howard-san would be a count... or was it a marquis? I'm not really sure about those things...

In fact, it seems Howard-san's great-grandfather was a border baron.

<b>

By the way, the name Amukamu was the family name of the border baron at that time, and when the feudal system was dismantled and democratization occurred 150 years ago, they renounced their titles and abolished their family name.

<b>

The Cloud surname is said to have been the maiden name of the lady of that time, and it was adopted thereafter.

<b>

And the village adjacent to the Amukamu Forest, also known as the Iroshio Great Forest, consists of a total of five villages, including Amukamu Village.

These five villages and one town are collectively called Amukamu County.

These used to be part of the "Amukamu Border Baron Territory."

<b>

The civil guard responsible for the defense of the Amukamu Forest is overseen by this Amukamu County.

And the highest authority is our Howard Cloud-san!

<b>

There are people who call Howard-san "Goshushou" or "O-kashira," but it seems that's what it means.

<b>

The families of the civil guard leaders were originally vassals of the Amukamu border baron, so even in modern times, due to Howard-san's abilities, they are always treated with respect.

<b>

But could you please stop calling him "O-kashira"?

It sounds like a thief or a bandit, and I don't like it!

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

In the afternoons, I often go out, but after evening, I help out at home again.

<b>

Mainly under Sonia Mama's guidance, I do sewing, cooking, and general housework.

<b>

Originally, I had been living on my own for about 15-16 years, so I had confidence in doing most housework.

I had confidence, but... the level here is different!!

<b>

Well, when I think about it, it's only natural.

There are no vacuum cleaners, washing machines, microwaves, or gas stoves here! Everything is done by hand.

I had only done things like sewing on buttons before.

I never thought I would be doing things like weaving lace or embroidery!

<b>

And, surprisingly, Sonia Mama is quite strict.

Always cheerfully saying, "Oh, you did well! Now, shall we try it again?" or "Oh, you can do it now? Good job! Now let’s try this next," presenting tasks one after another without giving me a chance to refuse.

<b>

As the level of the tasks I am given keeps increasing, I feel like I'm going to get dizzy, but I keep challenging myself.

Fortunately, Suzy's body is very dexterous and has a good memory.

If I were in my original body, I wouldn't be able to keep up at this pace.

<b>

Furthermore, if I were still in my original body, I think I would have been fed up with doing lace and embroidery. But for some reason, I, Suzy, am enjoying it. When the finished product is cute or beautiful, it really lifts my spirits.

<b>

It's a feeling that I can't imagine from my original self, but perhaps this is what it means for the body and mind to be in sync...

I can feel my original memories and body gradually diverging, but I wonder if that will lead to the creation of "Suzy Cloud"?

<b>

At the very least, I really like the way Suzy is now and the environment around her.

A teenage girl with the memories of her original self...

That is me now, "Suzy Cloud," and I am aware of it.

<b>

Now! Sonia Mama, please continue to train me! I will become a splendid lady who won't be ashamed to be anywhere, meeting your expectations someday!

<b>

<b>

<b>

Also, about the shower, hairdryer, and washlet! The reason I can use these devices is because of the existence of "magical tools."

Hmm... it's truly fantastic!!

<b>

The central part of this device contains a removable magical power battery.

It's a bit strange to call it a "battery" since it doesn't store electricity!

<b>

<b>

"Magical tools" are devices that can use only one type of magic, and by charging the "magical power battery" or replacing it with a new one, they can be used for a long time.

The "magical power battery" is literally cylindrical, like a battery; the smallest ones are about the size of AA batteries. The largest one we use in the Cloud household is for the hot water magical tool, about the size of a hairspray can.

<b>

This cylinder has a long, narrow window on its body, from which a faint emerald green light leaks out.

When this light weakens, it means the internal magical power is low, so at that time, it should be charged.

If the light doesn't emit and the contents become stagnant even after charging, that means the cell has reached the end of its lifespan, and at that time, the "magical power battery" should be replaced.

<b>

Used "magical power batteries" are collected by the village's fuel shop.

At that time, we are taught by Sonia-san to send them off with gratitude, saying, "Thank you for your hard work until now."

Yes, it's a good culture to cherish things!

<b>

<b>

However, when I asked why they don't use such convenient things for more various purposes, I was laughed at and told, "We have lamps for light, and we have firewood for ovens. There's no need to go out of our way to use magical tools. You're a strange child."

<b>

In this country... at least for the people in this village, if what they have is sufficient, they should just use that. It's common sense that there's no need to use magical tools unnecessarily.

<b>

Even so, the standard of living isn't that low; it's quite modern? At least it's not medieval.

I wonder if it's around the 19th century? But since there's no internal combustion engine, it feels a bit off.

<b>

Is it safe to say that this is a world where magical technology has advanced instead of internal combustion engines?

What do you call this kind of world view...?

<b>

<b>

By the way... I can't use these "magical tools."

Oh, saying I can't use them is a bit misleading; I can't activate them.

<b>

In other words, I can't turn the main power on or off.

<b>

What I can do is use things that are already activated.

So, for the shower, I can turn on the hot water or change the temperature after it's been activated, but if no one is around to activate it, I can't use it.

<b>

This "magical tool" requires a qualification to activate.

It seems there is a national certification system recognized by Auroral called the "Magical Skills Qualification Examination."

The name suddenly sounds less fantasy-like!

<b>

However, the content of the qualification seems to be very fantasy-like.

When you pass the exam, a magical mark corresponding to the qualification level is recorded in your ether body, allowing you to use magical tools that only qualified individuals can use.

<b>

<b>

With a Level 4 "Magical Skills Qualification," you can activate magical tools.

<b>

With Level 3, you can charge magical power into batteries, etc.

<b>

At Level 2 and above, you can perform maintenance and development of magical tools.

<b>

Having Level 2 is said to be sufficient for daily life.

The magical tool shop in this village is also run by a Level 2 holder. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to do business.

<b>

What about Level 1, you ask?

<b>

Level 1 holders are practically gods! ...or rather, there’s a huge difference between Level 1 and Level 2, and it seems to be at that level.

<b>

If you have Level 1, you are also permitted to develop new magic.

The country prohibits the development of chaotic magic that carries risks.

However, once you become a Level 1 holder, you are allowed to conduct research.

Moreover, instruction at the highest educational institutions, such as universities, is conducted by Level 1 holders.

<b>

So, in fact, Professor Henry Jameson was a Level 1 holder!

<b>

By the way, all the adults in our household are said to hold Level 3.

That's why they can charge the magical power batteries, so even if the magical power runs out, there's no need to worry.

<b>

However, it was a bit surprising that not only Howard-san but also Sonia-san and Elrose-san can use magic.

<b>

<b>

Furthermore, this qualification can be obtained in major cities or the royal capital, and if you enter a high school in a major city, you can obtain it directly through magical skills classes.

In higher-level schools, passing the entrance exam also grants you the qualification!

So, in this village, the advancement rate to high school is said to be almost 100%.

<b>

For that reason, none of the children in the village can activate magical tools right now.

It seems that when Carla and the others return after summer vacation, they will be qualified individuals...

Not that I'm jealous or anything!
