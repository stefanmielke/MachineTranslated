# 27 Summer Vacation in Amkam, Part 1

Explain the world view for a moment.


----------------

<blank>

I had heard the name Ravi several times before.

<blank>

Several of those who saw me for the first time spoke up on the spur of the moment.

At first I didn't mind that much, but when I saw several people like that, it became a quandary.

<blank>

<blank>

I asked Mr. Ryder with a light heart, thinking it was a good time to ask him...but I never expected to see such a pained expression on his face.

<blank>

This case does not seem to be one that can be casually shoved in one's face.

I'd be lying if I said I didn't care, but if my imagination is correct, I might make both Sonia-mama and Howard-daddy sad by trying to know ......, so there's no need to force them to know.

<blank>

Let it happen, and when the time comes to know, I'll know, right?

From now on, I will try not to take action on my own.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The day after the joint meeting, the graduation ceremony was over and we went on summer vacation.

<blank>

After our meeting at the training hall, I asked Sonia-mama if she had any training wear for me to use at the training hall, and she gave me a pair of loose-fitting pants and a V-neck shirt.

<blank>

Every morning since the summer vacation, I have been running around the village wearing this.

Running is the basis for body control.

I would try to imbibe the right amount of force in my body, while adding the strength of kicking the ground with my feet.

<blank>

Later, since I take the course to the side of the forest, I don't forget to search for signs in the forest every morning.

<blank>

When I come home from a run, Howard is always in the yard of our house training his sword.

<blank>

As if checking each kata one by one, sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, he manipulates the sword with quiet breathing.

<blank>

<blank>

I had never learned how to use a sword formally, so I asked Mr. Howard to take this opportunity to teach me....

<blank>

Suzy is far more skilled with a sword than I am. There is nothing I can teach him.

But...I...have...never...learned...how...to...use...my...body...power...just...using...the...power...of...my...body.

Then so be it. The sword that we are aiming for is a sword that can be wielded with honesty, without giving too much to the person, the sword, or the world. If I teach Suzy's sword, which is already at that level, the half-finished sword that I wield, it will disrupt the line of the sword.

<blank>

That said, Mr. Howard refused to give me sword instruction.

<blank>

However, that doesn't mean that watching Mr. Howard work out is a bad thing!

<blank>

So every morning after I get home from my run and take a shower, I sit quietly and watch my dad work out!

<blank>

<blank>

Howard's swordsmanship is powerful and supple.

<blank>

Every time he swings his sword, every time he steps forward, every muscle in his body tenses and leaps.

<blank>

Dripping sweat is shaken off and the steam from the body is scattered like a mirage as it winds around the body's movements.

<blank>

The powerful sword left a flash of light that reflected the morning sun, creating many streaks of light around Mr. Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard's swordsmanship is cool and very beautiful.

I have come to love the quiet time I spend watching.

It is also my important role to hand a towel to Howard Papa when he is done working out.

<blank>

When I hand him the towel, Howard accepts it with such glee.

Seeing their faces makes me very happy too.

<blank>

With that happy feeling, Howard went to take his morning shower and I went to prepare breakfast.

This is one morning in the Cloud family.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After breakfast, it's time to clean the mansion and do laundry.

<blank>

Sweeping, wiping, and polishing are the basic tasks, but until now, Elrose has been in charge of the second floor and Sonia of the first floor.

Don't put too much strain on Sonia-mama's legs going up and down the stairs.

<blank>

Now that I'm here, I'm allowed to work on both the first and second floors, mainly around the stairs.

<blank>

After all, I'm young! I can move around!

<blank>

But if you go too fast and leave some things to be swept or wiped, you'll be caught in Elrose's strict checks. ...... ahhh!

<blank>

The same goes for laundry; there are no washing machines, so everything is washed by hand! Too much force damages the fabric, too little removes the dirt, and you are forced to start over again and again.

Elrose is a spartan person, just like his image!

<blank>

After breakfast, I spend about two hours a day helping with the housework under his strict guidance.

I feel that my girl power is definitely improving day by day!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After helping with the household chores, he goes to the temple almost every day.

In the temple, I am taught mainly about customs and social common sense in this country, which I lack the most.

<blank>

In the temple, he is often with Mia and Bibi.

They are both here to study magic.

<blank>

I see these two almost every day during the summer vacation.

We are usually at the temple in the mornings and usually together in the afternoons when we are free.

You and Mia are together by far the most often. ......, but what? I don't think there's a day that goes by that we don't see each other. ......

We are very grateful to have Ms. Daisy at the temple, who also teaches us how to read and write.

<blank>

<blank>

Thanks to this, I have increased my knowledge about this country in many ways.

<blank>

First, the date and time.

Now is the blue moon of 2418 years 4 of the Cinnabar history.

The year has 365 days, one month has 30 and 31 days, and the month of 1 alternates between ao and beni until the month of 6.

<blank>

In short, a year is 12 months.

A week is seven days.

A day is 24 hours.

Almost the same as in modern Japan.

<blank>

In case you are wondering why there are blue and red moons, ......, there are two moons orbiting this star, one blue and one red.

These stars orbit each other like a binary star.

<blank>

<blank>

This is because the positions of the blue and red moons alternate between the front and the back every month.

The red moon is slightly smaller than the blue moon, so the outline of the blue moon is visible even when the red moon is in the foreground.

So we're talking about one day more date when it's a blue moon.

<blank>

<blank>

So, in fact, just the other day, the two moons overlapped with the red moon in the foreground, and even a total lunar eclipse occurred as it was.

In other words, the sun, this star, and the two moons have just coincided in a straight line, a rare celestial show that occurs only once every hundred or so years.

<blank>

Hmm~! What a shame....................................

I felt like I had lost so much by not being able to see it!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And the currency in this country, the smallest unit is called c.

<blank>

Coins are 1, 5, 10, and 25 copper coins.

50, 100, 250, and 500 silver coins.

From 1,000 kupr, the unit is changed to 1a, which is a gold coin.

<blank>

The Ault gold coins come in three denominations: 1, 5, and 50.

In addition, there are two other types of aurora bills, or bills, 10 and 100.

<blank>

The size and thickness of the coins can first be determined by touching them, as they become larger and thicker as they increase in value.

The 50 awl, for example, is quite large, so large that I cannot grip it in my hand.

<blank>

In case you are wondering, although I said that the kupuru is the smallest unit, there is actually a further iron coin called a stan under the kupuru copper coin.

This is 1c for 100s. Mostly, it seems to be used for things like pocket money for kids.

Coins from the Kupru copper coin on up are issued by the national government, but the iron coins are made by the local governments. Therefore, they cannot be used in other places.

<blank>

As for currency value, is one awl about 10,000 yen in Japan? It's just my own sense. ......

But my family, the Claudos, said that 11a is enough to live for a month. So, I don't think it is really applicable to the modern Japanese value system.

<blank>

<blank>

As a side note, in Amkam, the fur and bone materials of the hunted demonic beasts can be bought in the village.

The village processes and sells them to supplement the Protectorate's operating expenses.

<blank>

The boa and wolf that Mr. Howard and I hunted last time were demonic beasts from deep in the middle layer, which are rarely seen, so the purchase price became expensive, and one boa went for 17-8a.

I knew snakeskin was expensive!

<blank>

Wolf skins were also rare to find intact, and I was told that one piece was 12-3a.

<blank>

In the end, I froze when he handed me about 100 a., including the wolf he had cut into two pieces, and told me it was for you.

<blank>

I told him that he was getting too much, but if this was sold in King's Landing, it would be sold for more than ten times this amount, so there was no such thing as too much. He laughed at me, but that's not the point!

<blank>

I'm going to take care of you, and I need Howard to take care of you!

It is the prerogative of guardians to take care of their children's needs, so it is not something for children to worry about.

<blank>

But there was a lot of confusion.

In the end, we agreed that the money would be used for my tuition, and the rest would be saved and kept by Howard until I reached adulthood.

<blank>

Please take the money for clothes you bought before you went to school and other things from here.

I asked him to do it and he said .......　I asked him not to take away my pleasure of buying Suzy's clothes.　I was told with a sad look on my face.

<blank>

Ugh ...... I can't stop myself from pulling a face like that at Howard Dad....

<blank>

Incidentally, the reason why the purchase price is about 100a even though there are 10 12-3a is because I am using some of those wolf and boa skins to make my hunting equipment!

They say it will be ready during the summer vacation, so I am sure it will be soon.

I'm looking forward to it! I hope it's cool equipment!

<blank>

<blank>

One shocking fact I learned was that the Cloud family was actually a frontier count's family.

<blank>

What a surprise! In this day and age, Mr. Howard would be an earl. ...... I don't know much about that kind of thing. I don't know much about ...... that kind of thing. ......

As a matter of fact, Howard's great-grandfather was a frontier count.

<blank>

When the feudal system was dismantled and democratization took place 150 years ago, the title was returned and the family name was abolished.

<blank>

The last name "Cloud" was his wife's maiden name at that time, and he has been using it ever since.

<blank>

And there are a total of five villages adjacent to the Irosio Great Forest, the Amkamu Forest, including Amkamu Village.

These five villages and one town together are called Amkham District.

These are the former "Amkham Frontier Counties".

<blank>

The Amkamu County oversees the defense of the Amkamu Forest.

And the chief executive is our own Howard Cloud!

<blank>

There are people who call Mr. Howard "head of the head" or "head of the head," and this is what they mean.

<blank>

The members of the family who head the Protectorate's group are from families who were originally squires of the Count of Amkam frontier, so even today, Howard's competence and his responses are always respected.

<blank>

But can we please stop with the 'head'?

It looks like a bandit or a bandit, something I don't like!

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

So, I usually go out in the afternoon, but after the evening, I am supposed to help out at home again.

<blank>

I'm mainly doing general household chores such as sewing and cooking under the guidance of Sonia-mama.

<blank>

Originally, I had been living on my own for 15-6 years and had done most of the housework, so I was confident.

There were, but that of ...... Coco was on a different level!

<blank>

Well, it's obvious when you think about it.

There are no vacuum cleaners, washing machines, microwaves, or gas stoves here! Everything is done by hand.

I'd only ever done sewing and buttoning.

I never thought I'd be knitting lace or doing embroidery!

<blank>

And, Sonia's mom was a Spartan, if you ask me.

Always smiling. Oh, well done. So let's try again, shall we?　　Yes, you can do it now, can't you? That's great! Then, let's try this one next time, shall we?　And so on...and so on...and so on.

<blank>

As the level of the assignments became more and more advanced, I almost rolled my eyes, but I was up for the challenge.

Thankfully, this Suzy's body is very dexterous and she remembers things well.

If it were Osan's original body, he would not be able to do it at such a pace.

<blank>

Furthermore, when I was an Osan, I would have been fed up with lace and embroidery. But for some reason, I, Suzy, enjoy doing it. When the finished product is pretty or beautiful, I get very excited.

<blank>

It is an unthinkable movement of mind from the original Osan, but I wonder if this is what it means that the body and the mind are in sync....

I feel that my original memories and my mind and body are gradually diverging, and I wonder if this is what is going to create "Suzy Cloud". I wonder if this is what will make "Suzy Cloud".

<blank>

At least I like the way Susie is now and the environment around her very much.

An adolescent girl with memories of her former Osan. ......

I am aware that this is who I am now, "Suzy Cloud.

<blank>

Come on! Sonia mama. Please keep working on me, okay? Someday, I'll become a respectable lady who won't be ashamed to show her off anywhere, so that I can live up to your expectations, you know!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And that one! Showers, hair dryers, and washlets! The reason why the equipment in this area was usable.

This was because of the existence of 'magic tools'.

Hmmm...! Very humdrum indeed!

<blank>

The central part of this device is loaded with a battery-like object filled with removable magical power.

It does not store electricity, so the term "battery" is a strange one!

<blank>

<blank>

The "magic tool" is a device that can be used only for one magic, and it can be used for a long time by filling the "magic battery" with magic power or by reloading it with a new one, according to the company.

The "magic battery" is literally a cylindrical shape like a battery, and the smallest one is about the size of an AA battery. The biggest one we use at the Cloud house is for magic tools that produce hot water, and it's about the size of a hairspray.

<blank>

The body of this tube has a narrow vertical window through which a pale emerald green light leaks.

When this light weakens, the built-in magic power is also low, so they fill it with magic power and use it at that time.

I was taught that if the contents of the cell became stagnant without emitting light after filling it, it was the life of the cell and the "magic battery" should be replaced at that time.

<blank>

Used "magic batteries" will be taken back by the village fuel shop.

Sonia taught me that at that time, we should send off the discarded cells with our hands together, saying, "Thank you for all your hard work so far.

Yeah, it's a good culture of taking care of things!

<blank>

<blank>

But I asked him if such a useful thing exists, why don't we use it for more things?　We have lamps for lights, don't we? We have wood for ovens. Why go to the trouble of using magic tools? He laughed at me and said, "You are a funny girl.

<blank>

This country is ...... at least for the people of this village, if what they have is enough, they can go with it. If you have enough with what you have, you can just use it. It seems to be the norm in this country.

<blank>

Still, the standard of living is not that low, pretty modern? At least it's not medieval or anything.

Is it still about the 19th century? But it's a world without internal combustion engines, so there's a subtle sense of discomfort...

<blank>

Is that it? Are we talking about a world where magic technology has advanced in place of the internal combustion engine?

What do you call this kind of worldview ......?

<blank>

<blank>

And by the way, ...... this "magic tool" is not available for me.

I can't start it. I can't start it.

<blank>

In short, I cannot turn on and off the main power supply with my authority.

<blank>

All you can do is use what is already activated.

In other words, if you have a shower, you can start it up and then run hot water or change the temperature, but if no one is in the room, you cannot use the shower because it cannot be started up.

<blank>

You need to be qualified to activate this "magic tool".

It is a national certification system recognized by Aurora and is called the "Magical Technician Qualification Examination".

The name of the company has suddenly deviated from fantasy!

<blank>

But I think the qualifications are fantasy.

If you pass the exam, your etheric body will record a magic seal that matches the grade of your qualification, and you will be able to use magic tools and other items that can only be used by qualified persons.

<blank>

<blank>

This "Mage Certificate" at the fourth level will enable you to activate magic tools.

<blank>

At the third level, it is possible to fill magic batteries, etc. with magic power.

<blank>

At the second level and above, they are able to maintain and develop magical tools.

<blank>

They say that if you have the second level, you will be able to make a good living.

The magic tool shop in this village is also a second class holder. Otherwise, they can't do business.

<blank>

Huh? What about the first class? I mean?

<blank>

First kyu holders are gods! ...... or rather, there is a difference between first and second kyu, and it seems to be at such a level.

<blank>

If you have the first class, you are allowed to develop new magic.

The development of unregulated magic, which can be dangerous, is prohibited by the state.

They are allowed to study it when they become first class holders.

In addition, first-class instructors are required to teach at the highest educational institutions, such as universities.

<blank>

Yes, in fact, Professor Henry Jameson was a first class holder!

<blank>

In case you are wondering, all of our adults have the third grade.

So they can fill it, so they don't have to worry about running out of magic power in the magic battery.

<blank>

But it was a bit of a surprise to me that not only Howard, but also Sonia and Elrose could use magic.

<blank>

<blank>

And this qualification can be obtained in major cities and royal capitals, so if you enter a high school in a major city, you can obtain it in the magic skills class.

At the higher level schools, if the entrance exam is passed, the student will be qualified!

So in this village, the percentage of students who go on to higher education is almost 100 percent.

<blank>

That is why none of the children in the village can activate their magic tools now.

Karla and her family, who will be going on to higher education after the summer break, will be qualified the next time they return. ......

<blank>

I'm not a little bit disappointed at all, you know!
