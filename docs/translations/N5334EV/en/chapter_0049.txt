# 44 The Rite of Amcam Growth

Oh, it glowed.

<blank>

In the dimly lit room of the magic wing, Dana holds out her hand, and the five seminal plates emit a pale light.

Green and blue. The imprint of the parts that governed wind and earth shone softly.

<blank>

"I can't believe the vanguard responds to multiple attributes: ......"

<blank>

Colin raised his glasses with a snap, the frames glinting as he muttered.

<blank>

Originally, it is not possible for a genuine vanguard to show aptitude for more than one spirit.

That's why two people responded to multiple attributes in a row today.

Irving also nanted before this! He was reacting to the three attributes of fire, wind and nothingness!

<blank>

Impossible..." Bibi and Mia rolled their eyes and stared at Irving.

<blank>

Is this it? Could it be that the focus on running and kata practice went better than expected? Either way, this means that Dana no longer has to worry about the entrance exam coming up next month!

Duh! Good, good!

<blank>

Sue! Thanks! I owe it all to Sue!!!!"

Mew-mew-mew!"

<blank>

Dana hugged me as hard as she could.

My face is buried in its more than enough elastic bosom.

This is quite shiawase.

<blank>

I'm glad to hear that, Dana. I'm relieved, too.

<blank>

I looked up while buried in the comfortable chest and answered Dana with a big smile on my face, too.

Then, Dana, who was looking down at me, put more effort into it with a tinge in her cheeks.

<blank>

Oh, God! Already! Sue is too cute!"

<blank>

He was petting the dog and stroking it!

No, not on the sides! Oh, and the buttocks, too!

<blank>

I was writhing and enduring Dana's attack, when I felt a piercing look from behind me!　As I twisted and turned to withstand Dana's attack, I felt a piercing look from behind me.

If you turn your attention in that direction, you will see Mia looking at you with her hands flailing, as if she is aiming at her prey!

Mia? Why are you looking at me like that? Why are you breathing so hard? What are you doing with your hands? What are you doing?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Speaking of which, Sue. The day after tomorrow, right? I wonder if you've finished getting ready?"

<blank>

When Dana caught me and I was shivering with the aura that Mia exudes, Colin brought up the subject as if to offer a helping hand.

<blank>

I received the sword and the leather armor yesterday after they were adjusted! Yesterday, I received the sword and the leather armor... after they were adjusted! ...and I'm here... now!

<blank>

I answered Colin as I escaped from Dana's arms.

<blank>

We were already prepared for the encampment except for the swords and leather armor, so most of the preparations were ready when we received them yesterday.

<blank>

I'm sure you've got nothing to worry about! You have nothing to worry about.

Thanks Bibi! I'll do my best, okay?

<blank>

The "Amkham Coming of Age Ceremony" is a time-honored tradition for Amkham children to become independent at the age of 14.

<blank>

It's not hard to do.

All you have to do is go into the Amcam forest for a week and then come back alive.

This is a custom that has continued in this area for hundreds of years, and in the original world, it would be like the Genpuku ceremony.

<blank>

In the old days, children who entered the forest risked their lives.

Not all children made it back safely.

There were many children who could not come back.

That is why, before entering the forest, the children were given metal tags so that they could be identified in case of emergency.

It is a simple metal plate with no particular magic power inside, just a name, date of birth, and the name of the village from which he was born.

It's just a piece of metal to identify the person.

<blank>

When they return to the village after a successful week, they are recognized as a full-fledged person for the first time there.

Tag is that one villager...in those days, it was Amkam territory.

It is also a sign that you have officially become a resident of this Amcam.

<blank>

I think it was a very hard habit of the people who lived with the forest of Amkamu, where the magical beasts lived.

<blank>

Nowadays, there are safety measures in place, and it is rare for a child to not be able to return home.

The members of the Protectorate are guarding us without being attached to us.

Now it is just a convention, but it is still a week of survival living alone in the woods.

<blank>

Even today, bringing home a tag is a sign that a child has become a full-fledged member of the family.

<blank>

For me, having a tag means that I have become a true resident of the village.

So I'm really looking forward to that time, and I'm really looking forward to it!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What happened to everyone else?"

<blank>

I got a little excited thinking about the day after tomorrow and wanted to hear from someone who has been there.

<blank>

I...didn't do much of anything, I guess..."

<blank>

Irving began to speak as he recalled with his right hand lightly on his chin.

Irving's birthday is in the red month of 5, so he's done in early fall.

<blank>

I've been thrown into the woods by my father every so often since I was a kid of about five. I usually lived on my own for 10 or 20 days...and then I'd be out there for a week or so, and I'd feel like it was a new thing.

<blank>

My brothers said it was similar,?　said Dr. Irving.

Oh, I was talking about people who shouldn't be referred to here.

<blank>

What are you doing? What are you making me do, Haggard family? Mr. Harry!

What if something happens to your children?

What will you do if you don't come back? How Spartan can you be?

Oh...but Harry, you are the "Golden Lion", right?

The lion pushes his cub down into the valley of a thousand questions? Like a lion pushing his cub into the forest?

But usually you can't! Because you'll die!

And yet Irving is pretty funny too, talking about it with a nonchalant face, you know?

It's already scary, the Haggard family!

Is this how the boys of Amkam's heroic family grow up?

<blank>

"Da, how was Dana?"

<blank>

Let's put aside for the moment the opinions of people who are not helpful, and seek fruitful stories.

I think the right thing to do is to ask the experienced upperclassmen here.

<blank>

I just kept on hunting horned rabbits!

<blank>

Hmm?

<blank>

'The number of birds I hunted in a week, 43 in all! Isn't that great? I don't think this record is going to be broken anytime soon!

<blank>

Huh? Well.... Oh, by the way! A horned rabbit is a beast that lives in the shallows of the forest, not a demonic beast. Since it is not a magical beast, its meat can be eaten normally.

Its appearance is that of a large rabbit with antlers like a deer. Its meat is quite tasty, and its fur is versatile and can be used in many ways.

Moreover, the quality of Amkham products is better than that of other places, and they are one of Amkham's specialties.

Even children can hunt safely, so they are exclusively useful as good pocket money earners for the children of AMCAM...but...!

They are not easy to hunt, as they are very alert and extremely fast.

I often hear stories of people spending an entire day with zero results.

<blank>

Well, since they can be such a hard catch, I can get a good price for them and get some extra money in my pocket!

<blank>

And Dana continued to hunt such hard-to-capture horned rabbits at an average rate of five to six a day?

You know, hunting five horned rabbits in one day is impossible for normal kids, right? That's an unusual number, you know?

<blank>

I'm not going to be able to hunt in the woods for a week! I've never had the opportunity to hunt in the woods for a week! I was crazy about setting a record!"

<blank>

Dana smiles proudly, "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Yes, I knew I was a bad person too.

<blank>

This ritual was originally intended to test the life force and survival skills of a single person in the harsh Amkamu forest.

And yet, Dana had abandoned the original purpose of the ordeal, chasing around the horned rabbits, which are even more difficult to hunt, and became obsessed with increasing her score....

No, no, no, this person! She was the kind of older sister that juniors should not emulate!

<blank>

<blank>

Oooh, now I'm well aware that Irving and Dana are fellow brainiacs!

So, Fiorina! Don't nod your head in admiration like that! You know what? You see the look of dismay on Carl's face? These two are out of character, okay? Don't imitate them! Don't imitate them! Let's learn from normal people!

<blank>

I looked around in dismay at the two of them, and my eyes met Bibi's. Bibi cowered her shoulders, let out a sigh, and shook her head.

Oooh, the feelings are synchronized. These two are no good, right?

I looked at Colin with a fearful gaze in anticipation... Colin would be fine, right?

<blank>

Well, did I start by finding a safe place to camp?"

<blank>

Oh! This is it! That's a normal and obvious answer! This is what I was looking for! This is what I was looking for!

Quintessential honor student, Sister Colin! I love you, too!

<blank>

Unh! Unh! So? So?

<blank>

Zzzz! and urged Colin to approach and proceed.

<blank>

It's a good thing I practiced setting up the tent before I went out, because I would have lost a whole day if I hadn't been used to it. If I hadn't been used to it, I would have lost a whole day. I could get my own water, so that wasn't a problem, but I did have to be careful about getting and keeping a fire going.

<blank>

I knew it was quintessential! Bibi and I nodded our heads and listened to Colin's story.

Well, Bibi will have his "coming of age ceremony" the month after next! I'm sure I'll listen to what these well-informed people have to say!

It is instructive to hear stories like this that can only be told by someone who has been there.

What was good? What went wrong? This is what I wanted to hear!

<blank>

Oh, by the way, where's the other experienced person? I looked around and saw Mia looking at me with a "welcome anytime" look on her face.

<blank>

Oh, um... how was Mia?"

<blank>

As soon as I asked him, "What do you mean? He looked so happy and started talking about it.

<blank>

I was 6 Sougetsu, wasn't I? I was 6 in the blue moon, right? It was already snowing, so I thought it would be hard to stay in the tent, so I enclosed the tent with plants.

<blank>

According to Mia, a small dome-like wind shelter was created by extending tree branches around the tent and by magically binding the ivy together.

The snow piled up there and made it look like a little hut, in which the people sheltered from the cold.

<blank>

The snow and wind were cold, and I had to make the fire myself, so it was very hard work!

<blank>

Yes, these "trials" change in difficulty depending on the season and weather.

It's supposed to be a week from the birthday, so there's no postponement or advance due to bad weather.

There have been instances where the schedule has been moved up, but there is no change in the schedule due to weather conditions.

So, while some children, like Mia, have to have their sessions in the cold season, others, like me and Bibi, have to have them in a more comfortable season.

But even if the season is good, you will have a hard time when a storm comes and the weather is stormy.

It's also the season when wild animals become more active! Either way, we must not let our guard down.

<blank>

But we had enough food for a week, a tent and sleeping bag to keep us warm, and we were allowed to use the magical equipment to heat the house," he said. We were also allowed to use the magical equipment for heating, so we made it work."

<blank>

The inexperienced children are relieved when Mia explains that

Yes, a child in a difficult situation like this can get food and other follow-up services.

It's tough to be self-sufficient in food in the winter!

On the other hand, those of us in more comfortable seasons have to make do with food on our own.

Well, that's why Dana and Irvin were able to hunt and fend for themselves with impunity!

<blank>

<blank>

But still, I had to endure the cold for a week.... Oh, the cold came back when I remembered! My body needs some warmth, don't you know?

"...! Fumyunpu?

<blank>

Just as I thought I had said that, Mia hugged me from the front! My face was buried in Mia's large mass!

<blank>

Oh, it's warm...it's warm, Sue-chan."

<blank>

This, this! Mia's signature depraved meat hold!

It's a meat trap that exploits my habit of getting buried in this comfortable space and not being able to leave!

Mia's hands were stroking his motionless body in every direction!

<blank>

Ah...ah...ah...ah...ah...ah..." Apu-nnnn! Meow! Sho, Shoko..! Don't stroke me...! Nnnnggg!

I'm warm....Soo-chan warm...! It's warm...soo warm...! And... soft..."

<blank>

Mia's hands were caressing my back, armpits, and waist! And even her buttocks were being caressed with her hands!

Ah! Was this what you were aiming for?

<blank>

Even though she was doing this to me, I didn't take my face away from between the pincers, and I was puffing and puffing on the corrupt flesh with both of my hands!

Ah! What a depth of my own karma?

Fearless! Fallen meat hold!

But, but..! While we're at it, Mia's attackers will invade further! That's..! There! Don't reach for it! No!

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Meow! Nyuhhhhhhhh!"

<blank>

And today, my embarrassing voice echoed in the room like a punch line again.

<blank>

<blank>



<blank>

----------------

Irving and the boys, who were gawking at Sue-chan, who was writhing around cutely, were kicked in the butt by Bibi and kicked out of the room!

And by the way...it was my turn at the end! Willie, who was breathing hard, was kicked out with him, and he realized that he had been airborne. Chan chan...
