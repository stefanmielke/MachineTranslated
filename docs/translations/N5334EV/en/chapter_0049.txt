# Chapter 44: The Amukam Growth Ceremony

"…Ah, it lit up."

<b>

In the dimly lit magic building, the five spirit plates that Dana held emitted a faint light.

Green and blue. The engravings of the parts governing wind and earth glowed softly.

<b>

"To think the front line reacts to multiple attributes..."

<b>

Colin adjusted his glasses, the frame glinting as he murmured.

<b>

It is said that it is almost impossible for a pure front-line job to show aptitude for multiple spirits.

Yet today, two people reacted to multiple attributes in quick succession.

Arvin had also reacted to three attributes: fire, wind, and void, just the other day!!

<b>

Unbelievable... Bib and Mia stared wide-eyed at Arvin.

<b>

Could this be it? Could it be that the concentration from running and the kata practice went better than expected? In any case, this means Dana no longer has anxiety about the entrance exam coming next month!

Yes! I'm so glad, so glad!!

<b>

"Thank you, Sue! It's all thanks to you!!"

"Mewgyum!"

<b>

Dana hugged me tightly.

My face was buried in her sufficiently elastic chest.

This is quite happy in its own way.

<b>

"I'm glad, Dana. I'm relieved too, you know?"

<b>

While buried in the comfortable chest, I looked up and replied to Dana with a broad smile.

Then, Dana, looking down at me, blushed and squeezed even tighter.

<b>

"Ahhh! Sue is just too cute!!!"

<b>

She exclaimed, ruffling my hair all over!

W-wait, not the sides! N-not the bottom too!

<b>

As I squirmed and endured Dana's attack, I felt a piercing gaze from behind.

When I turned my attention that way, Mia was looking at me with both hands flailing, like a predator targeting its prey?!

M-Mia?! Why are you looking at me like that?! Your breathing is heavy?! What are those hands for? What do you plan to do?!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"By the way, Sue. It's the day after tomorrow, right? Have you finished your preparations?"

<b>

Just as I was caught by Dana and trembling at the aura Mia was giving off, Colin changed the subject as if to throw me a lifeline.

<b>

"Yup! Yesterday, I finished adjusting my sword and leather armor, and I received them! ...They came... right?"

<b>

I answered Colin while escaping from Dana's arms.

<b>

Aside from the sword and leather armor, the preparations for camping were already done, so with yesterday's receipt, most of the preparations were complete.

<b>

"Well! I have no worries about you, but do your best!"

"Thanks, Bib! I'll do my best!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"The 'Amukam Coming of Age Ceremony' is a tradition that has been passed down for generations, conducted when the children of Amukam turn 14 years old to signify their independence."

<b>

What needs to be done is not particularly difficult.

All you have to do is enter the Amukam forest for a week and return alive.

This has been a custom in this region for hundreds of years, akin to a coming-of-age ceremony in the original world.

<b>

In ancient times, it was indeed life-threatening for children to enter the forest.

Not all children returned safely.

Many children were said to have not come back.

Thus, before entering the forest, children were given metal tags to ensure their identity could be verified in case of emergencies.

These were just plain metal plates engraved with their name, date of birth, and the name of their village, without any magical power.

Just a metal piece for identification.

<b>

When they returned to the village safely after a week, they were recognized as adults for the first time.

The tag was a mark of being a full-fledged villager... back then, it would be the Amukam territory.

It was also proof of officially becoming a resident of Amukam.

<b>

I think it was a rather harsh tradition for the people living alongside the magical beasts of the Amukam forest.

<b>

In modern times, solid safety measures have been implemented, and there are hardly any children who do not return.

The members of the guard are protecting them closely, after all.

Now it is merely a custom, but it remains unchanged that one must survive alone in the forest for a week.

<b>

Even today, bringing back the tag signifies that the children have truly become adults.

<b>

For me, being able to carry the tag feels like proof that I have truly become a resident of the village.

So, I am very much looking forward to that moment and eagerly anticipating it!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What was it like for everyone?"

<b>

Thinking about the day after tomorrow got me a bit excited, and I wanted to hear stories from those who had experienced it.

<b>

"I... didn't really do anything special..."

<b>

Arvin began to speak, lightly resting his right hand on his chin as he reminisced.

Arvin's birthday is in the 5th month of the red moon, so he had already completed it by autumn.

<b>

"Basically, since I was about five, my dad often threw me into the forest. I normally lived alone for 10 or 20 days... so a week felt like nothing special."

<b>

He said that his older brothers had similar experiences. Ah, this was not someone whose story I should take as a reference.

<b>

What are you doing? What are you making the Haggard family do?! Harry?!

What would you do if something happened to your children?!

What if they didn't come back?!! This is too much of a Spartan approach?!

Ah... but wasn't Harry a 'Golden Lion'?

Isn't it like a lion throwing its cub into the depths of a valley? Like deliberately pushing them into the forest?!

But normally, that's impossible! They would die!!

Yet Arvin speaks about it with a straight face, which is quite strange?!

The Haggard family is scary!

Is this how the sons of the Amukam hero family are raised?!

<b>

"W-what about you, Dana?"

<b>

Putting aside the opinions of those who are not helpful, I sought a more substantial story.

I thought it would be right to ask the experienced upperclassmen present here.

<b>

"I just kept hunting horned rabbits!"

<b>

Huh?

<b>

"I hunted a total of 43 in a week! Isn't that amazing?! I don't think this record will be easily surpassed!!"

<b>

Oh? Um... By the way! Horned rabbits are beasts that inhabit the shallow layers of the forest and are not magical beasts. Since they are not magical beasts, their meat is safe to eat.

They are large rabbits with antlers like a deer. Their meat is quite tasty, and their fur is highly versatile and can be used for various purposes.

Moreover, the Amukam variety is said to be of better quality than those from other places, making it one of Amukam's specialties.

Since they can be safely hunted even by children, they serve as a good source of pocket money for the children of Amukam... but!

They are also very cautious and incredibly fast, making them not easy to catch.

It's common to hear stories of people spending a whole day without catching anything.

<b>

Well, since they are so hard to catch, they can be sold for a good price, which helps with pocket money!

<b>

So, Dana managed to hunt those hard-to-catch horned rabbits at an average pace of 5 to 6 a day?

Hunting five horned rabbits in a day is impossible for ordinary children! That's an extraordinary number!

<b>

"After all! There’s no opportunity to be allowed to hunt in the forest for a week! I got so caught up in it that I challenged myself to break the record!!"

<b>

Ahahaha! Dana laughed proudly. Yes, it seems she is also someone not to be emulated.

<b>

Originally, this ceremony is meant to test one's vitality and survival skills to see if one can survive alone in the harsh Amukam forest.

Yet Dana completely disregarded the true purpose of the trial, chasing after the already difficult-to-hunt horned rabbits and getting absorbed in increasing her score...

This person is not suitable for a junior to emulate!!

<b>

<b>

Yes, it's clear now that Arvin and Dana are both in the same muscle-headed group!

So Fiorina! Don't nod in admiration like that! Look! Karl is also looking exasperated! These two are outside the norm! Don't try to imitate them! Absolutely not!! Let's learn from normal people!!

<b>

As I looked around in exasperation at those two, my gaze met Bib's. Bib shrugged and sighed, shaking her head.

Yes, I felt synchronized with her. These two are hopeless, right?

Then, with expectations in mind, I cautiously turned my gaze to Colin... Colin should be fine, right?

<b>

"Well, I think I started by looking for a safe camping spot first?"

<b>

Oh wow! This is it! This is the kind of normal, expected answer I was looking for! This is the one!!

As expected of the honor student, Colin! I love you!!

<b>

"Yes! Yes!! And then? And then?!"

<b>

I moved closer to Colin, urging her to continue.

<b>

"It was good that I practiced setting up the tent beforehand so I could do it by myself. If I hadn't been used to it, I would have definitely wasted a whole day. I could get water myself, so that wasn't a problem, but I had to be careful about securing and maintaining the fire."

<b>

As expected, she is impressive! Bib and I nodded along, listening intently to Colin's story.

Yes, Bib's coming-of-age ceremony is next month too! We should listen to the stories of such reliable people!!

These are the kinds of stories that can only be told by those with experience, and they are educational.

What went well? What were the failures? These are the things I wanted to hear!

<b>

Ah, speaking of which, where's the other experienced person? As I looked around, I saw Mia looking at me with a welcoming expression.

<b>

"Ah, um... Mia, how was it for you?"

<b>

As soon as I asked, she began to speak with a face full of joy, as if she had found her voice!

<b>

"Look! I was born in the 6th month of the blue moon, right? Since the snow was already piled up, I thought it would be tough to spend time in the tent, so I used plants to surround the tent."

<b>

According to Mia, she extended tree branches around the tent and used vines to magically bind them, creating a small dome-shaped windbreak.

The snow piled up there, turning it into a sort of igloo, and she managed to keep warm inside.

<b>

"The snow wind was cold, and I had to start the fire myself, so it was really tough!"

<b>

That's right, this "trial" changes in difficulty depending on the season and weather.

It is set to one week from the birthday, so there are no postponements or advancements due to bad weather.

There are cases where it is advanced, but there are no changes in schedule due to weather.

So, there are children like Mia who have to do it in cold periods, while others like me and Bib do it in more comfortable seasons.

However, just because the season is good doesn't mean you won't face difficulties if a storm hits and the weather turns bad.

It's also the season when wild animals become more active! Either way, one must not let their guard down.

<b>

"But I was allowed to bring a week's worth of food, and I had a cold-resistant tent and sleeping bag. Plus, I was allowed to use heating magical tools, so I managed somehow."

<b>

Mia's explanation relieved the inexperienced children.

That's right, children in harsh situations receive support for food and such.

Self-sufficiency for food in winter is tough!

On the other hand, those of us in more comfortable seasons must manage to provide for ourselves.

Well, Dana and Arvin were fine hunting and living on their own, though!

<b>

<b>

"Even so, I still had to endure the cold for a week... Ah, remembering it makes the cold come back! My body craves warmth?!"

"…! Fuhyunpu?!"

<b>

Just as she said that, Mia hugged me from the front! My face was buried in Mia's large form!!

<b>

"Ah, it's warm... so warm, Sue-chan."

<b>

Th-this is! Mia's signature soft meat hold!!

Once I get buried in this comfortable gap, I can't escape; it's a trap of flesh that exploits my tendency to become immobile!

Her hands are freely and wildly stroking my immobile body!!

<b>

"Ah... ah! Nyu! Nyuuhhh!! Nyaaa!! D-don't...! Don't stroke...!! Nn!!"

"Ah! It's warm... Sue-chan is warm...! And... so soft♪"

<b>

M-Mia's hands... are stroking my back, sides, and waist! And then both hands are flailing at my bottom!

Ah! Was she aiming for this when she was flailing earlier?!

<b>

Even while this is happening, I can't pull my face away from the gap, and I'm even using both hands to pat her soft flesh!!!

Ah! What depth of my own misfortune!

The fearsome soft meat hold!!

But! While I’m in this situation, Mia's attacks are advancing further!! No! Stretching your fingers there is forbidden!!!

<b>

"Ahh! Nya! Nyuuhh—nnnnnnn!"

<b>

And once again, my embarrassing voice echoed in the room like a punchline.

<b>

<b>

<b>

----------------

The boys, including Arvin, who had been staring intently at the writhing Sue-chan, were kicked out of the room by Bib-chan!

Additionally... Willie, who was ready for his turn at the end, was also kicked out, realizing he was just air. The end♪
