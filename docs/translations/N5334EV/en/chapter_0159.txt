# Chapter 147: Murky Droplets

Around the Purple House, five guards were on duty that day.

In the blink of an eye, they were all knocked down.

<b>

When a large dog attacked the guards, two men took advantage of the distraction to launch their own assault.

The men each held something resembling a club in their hands and swung it full force at the guards' heads and faces.

<b>

The clubs were about the length and thickness of baseball bats, but at their ends were lumps that were likely larger than the men's clenched fists. Additionally, stones of various sizes were embedded in them, creating an irregular surface.

<b>

The armor and helmets worn by the guards could not withstand the impact, and they were dented and caved in with a single blow.

<b>

"Red eyes? Could it be a magical beast?! Did you send the guards to attack with a magical beast?!"

"Impossible! Are you saying someone is controlling a magical beast?!"

"Controlling a magical beast... It's not impossible..."

<b>

Lucille discerned from the glowing red eyes that the large dog was indeed a magical beast.

To Annie, who couldn't believe it, Cordelia quietly stated, "There is a way."

<b>

As the guards fell and let out weak groans, the smaller of the two men shouted towards the facility.

<b>

"I know you're in there! Come out, Karen!!"

<b>

"Do you have business with Karen?"

<b>

Without flinching at the devastation happening right before her eyes, Cordelia returned the man's question with a strong gaze.

<b>

"Upon closer inspection, aren't you the one who fled yesterday? You came back without learning your lesson?"

<b>

While deliberately provoking him, she stepped forward to shield Dan and Nan. She gestured behind her to guide the two inside the facility, but they clung to Cordelia's back and refused to let go.

<b>

"Didn't I tell you, Parker?! What's wrong? Weren't you going to repay yesterday's debt?"

"I know! Mr. Fluke!"

<b>

Parker grimaced and swung the club he was holding down.

With a loud thud, the cobblestones shattered.

<b>

"Just because it's Miriya, don't get cocky! Look out!!"

<b>

In that moment, Cordelia's body jolted slightly, but she showed no sign of it, hiding her mouth with the fan she had taken out.

<b>

"Oh? Is that what you call a defeated dog's howl?"

<b>

"Like I'd fall for the same trick! 'Fireball'!"

"What?!!"

<b>

Parker thrust the club towards them, clumsily chanting the spell's name, and a fireball was conjured at its tip, heading straight for Catherine.

The fireball, both in size and speed, was far inferior to what a Miriya student would typically conjure.

However, it was enough to stop Catherine, who was about to cast a spell.

<b>

"!!"

"You cast a spell?!"

"Hahaha! I'm just getting started! 'Fireball', 'Fireball', 'Fireball'!"

<b>

Catherine's arms, which she raised instinctively to shield herself, took the full brunt of the magic.

The power of the basic spell was not a significant threat.

The flames merely singed the sleeves of her uniform, which had magical resistance.

Yet, unbelievably, the opponent was firing them in rapid succession.

<b>

"Wait?! In a row? Just by saying the spell's name?!"

<b>

Normally, to use magic, one must channel magical power through what could be called a spiritual conduit etched into the mind and body, manifesting the magical seal as the foundation.

<b>

But what about the opponent casting magic right before her?

It was hard to believe that magical power was flowing through the conduit.

It didn't look like magic was manifesting from the magical seal at all.

<b>

The flow of magical power through the proper channels is orderly and coherent. It shouldn't be this rough.

<b>

There was no quiet, natural flow of magical power like when using elemental magic.

What was present was a turbulent, chaotic, and forceful explosion of magical energy, as if it were a murky torrent.

It looked as if they were forcibly jamming magical power through an irregular route to trigger the spell.

<b>

Upon closer inspection, when the magic was activated, several stones embedded at the tip of the club were glowing.

<b>

I see! Those are not even a proper "staff," but a haphazardly constructed magical tool meant to activate magic.

That weapon was designed to forcibly siphon magical power from an opponent without a magical seal to trigger spells. Cordelia understood this by observing the spilling light of magical energy.

<b>

At the same time, Cordelia began to cast a spell from the tip of the fan she had thrust forward.

"Magical Barrier"

A shield spread in front of Catherine, beginning to block the fireball.

<b>

"Thank you, Cordelia-sama."

"No, ... there is no damage, right?"

"Of course not."

<b>

The flow of magical power Cordelia had just used and the murky torrent of magical power Parker was using right in front of her were completely different.

The flow and quality of the magical power were that distinct.

<b>

Soon, blood began to trickle from Parker's nose, ears, and eyes.

<b>

"If you keep this up! Your body will...!"

"Hya-hahaha! Hya-haaa! Hya-hah!!"

Magical power exceeding his capacity coursed through his body, bursting capillaries and destroying his flesh.

Even so, Parker continued to laugh maniacally, spraying his blood around as he kept casting spells.

<b>

"You! If you keep using that, you'll die!"

<b>

As Cordelia shielded the screaming twins from the incoming fireballs, she called out to Parker.

As if to prove her words, blood continued to pour from Parker's body.

<b>

Parker was still laughing maniacally.

But soon, he lowered the club, panting heavily.

His complexion was certainly not good. He leaned against the raised club, gasping for breath.

<b>

"Look! You can't go any further..."

<b>

Cordelia cautiously spoke to Parker, who had lowered his weapon.

Even if it was a basic spell like "Fireball," even Miriya students could only fire about five or six at most at once.

If they tried to cast more, they would undoubtedly faint from magical exhaustion.

Parker had already fired more than ten. It was a miracle he hadn't exceeded his limits.

<b>

Parker's condition was visibly dire.

His pale face was streaming with sweat and blood like a waterfall.

His breathing was ragged, and he looked as if he were on the verge of suffocation.

He was barely standing, leaning against the club.

<b>

With that much exhaustion, he shouldn't be able to cast any more spells, let alone even stand.

Cordelia reached out to guide the twins into the building for safety.

<b>

However, something about Parker's demeanor was strange.

He still hadn't stopped laughing.

That behavior felt extremely eerie to Cordelia.

<b>

"Hih... Hih! ... Hya-hah!"

"Here! Keep one more ready."

<b>

Fluke tossed something to Parker.

<b>

With trembling hands, Parker managed to catch it. Then, with his shaking hands, he snapped it in half in the middle.

<b>

It was a small vial that fit in his hand.

Parker tilted the broken vial towards his mouth and gulped down its contents in one go.

<b>

"――――――――!"

<b>

With the club still planted in the cobblestones, Parker's complexion rapidly reddened as he drank the contents of the vial.

Not only that, but it seemed his blood flow had increased excessively, causing the blood vessels in his head to bulge. The redness on his face, which looked like it was boiling, turned dark.

<b>

"Awesome! This is amazing! Fluke, you're incredible!!"

"Of course. It's a 'special' after all."

<b>

Yet, despite such horrifying changes, Parker's excitement was abnormally high.

Fluke, in response, seemed somewhat pleased, as if there were no tension at all.

<b>

<b>

However, amid such vulnerable men, Lucille was on the move.

<b>

Having been caught off guard by a surprise magical attack, the situation had unintentionally begun at their pace, but this opening was not to be missed.

<b>

Lucille lowered her body and dashed through their blind spots, swinging her dagger fiercely at Parker.

<b>

"?!"

<b>

However, the dagger did not reach Parker.

It was caught firmly by Fluke, who had carelessly extended his left hand in front of Parker.

<b>

"Huh? What is it?"

<b>

Parker belatedly noticed Fluke's arm thrust out in front of him and let out a dull voice.

<b>

"Do you think this toy is useful?"

<b>

Ignoring Parker, Fluke lifted Lucille's arm along with the dagger he had grasped and smirked lewdly.
