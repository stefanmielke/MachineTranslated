# 147 The Starchy Drop

The Purple House was surrounded by five guards that day.

It was all reaped before I saw it.

<blank>

When a large dog attacked the guards, they tried to react, but two men took advantage of the opportunity and attacked them.

The men each held a club-like object in their hands and struck the guards in the head and face with full swing.

<blank>

The club was about as long and thick as a baseball bat, but it had a bump on the end that was probably larger than the men's fists. In addition, there were stones of various sizes embedded in it, creating a distorted, uneven surface.

<blank>

The armor and helmets worn by the guards could not withstand the impact of it, and they caved in, heavily dented by the blow.

<blank>

Red eyes? Are you sure it's not a hexenbiest? You let a hexenbiest attack the guards?

No way! Are you telling me that you are controlling the whole thing?

"Control the Hexenbiest ....... It's not something you can't do. ......"

<blank>

Lucille recognized the large dog as a magical beast from its red, insinuating eyes.

Annie says she can't believe it, but Cordelia quietly tells her, "We have the means.

<blank>

As the guards fell to the ground and groaned weakly, the smaller of the two men raised his voice to the facility.

<blank>

I know you're in there! Come out, Karen!

<blank>

Is there something Karen can help you with?

<blank>

Cordelia asked the man with a strong gaze, not intimidated by the drama of violation that had just taken place in front of her eyes.

<blank>

I looked at him carefully and saw that you were the one who ran away yesterday. Have you not learned your lesson and come again?"

<blank>

He stepped forward as if to protect Dan and Nan, daring to provoke them, and indicated with his hand behind his back that he wanted them to go inside the facility, but they clung to Cordelia's back and would not move away.

<blank>

"That's what they say, Parker! What's the matter? I thought you were gonna pay me back for yesterday."

I understand." Mr. Fluke!"

<blank>

Parker's face contorted and he swung the cudgel down in his hand.

With a thud, the cobblestone bricks shattered.

<blank>

Don't get carried away just because you're Milia! Gora-DAH!"

<blank>

At that moment, Cordelia's body jumped, but she did not show any concern and hid her mouth with the fan she had taken out.

<blank>

"Oh? Is that what you call a loser's howl?"

<blank>

I'm not going to fall for that! "Fear no more!"

?

<blank>

Parker held out his club toward them and chanted a poor magic name, which triggered the magic at the tip and created a fireball. A fireball was born at the tip of the club. It headed straight for Katherine.

The fireballs that were shot out were quite inferior in size and speed to those used by Myria students.

But it was enough to stop Catherine, who was about to cast a spell.

<blank>

!!!"

Did you use magic?

Hi-hahaha! I'm not done yet! Hooray, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo!"

<blank>

Both of Catherine's arms, which she quickly covered up, take a direct hit from the magic.

The power of the basic magic released is not enough to pose a threat.

The fire only slightly scorched the sleeve of the uniform, which is granted magical resistance.

But unbelievably, the opponent is firing it in rapid succession.

<blank>

Oh, no! In a row? You only use the name of the magic?

<blank>

Originally, in order to use magic, one had to pass magic power through a spiritual groove, which could be called a magical circuit, carved into the body and mind, and use the spiritual mark as the backbone of expression.

<blank>

But what about the person who is using magic in front of you right now?

It is very hard to believe that magic is flowing in the spirit groove.

It does not look as if magic is being manifested from the spirit seal.

<blank>

The flow of magical power through a legitimate path is orderly and consistent. It cannot be such a rough flow.

<blank>

There is no quiet, natural flow of magic here, as there is when using spirit magic.

It is such a muddy stream of magic power that seems to be exploding wildly, chaotically, and forcefully.

It looks as if he is forcibly activating magic by forcibly twisting magic power from an unauthorized route.

<blank>

If you look closely, you can see that when the magic is activated, several stones embedded in the end of the club are glowing.

<blank>

I see! That's a messy, unorganized, magical tool that can't even be called a "wand," and it's used to invoke magic.

That weapon is used to forcibly absorb magic power from an opponent who does not have a spirit seal and activate magic. Cordelia understood this when she saw the light of magic power leaking from the weapon.

<blank>

At the same time, Cordelia deploys the magic she had been chanting from the tip of her fan, which she thrust forward.

The Magic Barrier.

A shield spread out in front of Catherine, who was under magic, and began to block that fireball.

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Cordelia."

No, there is no ...... damage, is there?"

Of course.

<blank>

I can see that the flow of magic that Cordilia just used and the muddy stream of magic that Parker is using in front of him are two completely different things.

That's how different the flow and quality of the magic is.

<blank>

Soon, blood spills from Parker's nose, ears, and eyes.

<blank>

You can't keep doing that! Your body is ......!"

'Hyahahahahhhhhhhh! Hyahahahahhhhhhhh!"

<blank>

Magic power beyond his own capacity rushes through his body, rupturing his capillaries and destroying his physical body.

Still, Parker laughs like a madman and continues to shoot magic, while sprinkling his own blood around.

<blank>

Anata! If you keep using that thing, you'll die! You'll die!"

<blank>

Cordelia shouted to Parker, shielding the screaming twins from the flying fireballs.

As if to prove his words, Parker's body continues to flood with blood.

<blank>

Parker was still laughing like crazy.

But soon after, he drops the cudgel, out of breath.

His complexion is not as good as it should be. He rested himself on the cudgel he had erected, breathing on his shoulders.

<blank>

See, no more ......"

<blank>

Cordelia speaks fearfully to Parker, who has lowered his weapon.

Even with the basic magic "fireball," even Cordelia and the other students of Milia can fire at most five or six shots at a time.

If he tried to use more than that, he would surely run out of magic power and fall into a coma.

Parker had already fired a dozen or so shots. It would be crazy not to go over the limit.

<blank>

In fact, Parker's condition is as bad as it looks.

His bloodless face is drenched in a waterfall of sweat and blood.

His breathing is very labored and he seems to be having difficulty breathing.

It's as if they are barely standing with their bodies resting on a cudgel.

<blank>

With all that wear and tear, it should be difficult to even stand up, let alone shoot magic any more.

Cordilia reached for their bodies to evacuate the twins into the building while she still could.

<blank>

But there is something wrong with Parker.

I still haven't stopped laughing.

The situation is terribly eerie to Cordelia.

<blank>

"Hiccup ...... hiccup! ...... hihah!"

Here you go! Keep another bottle open."

<blank>

Fluke threw something at that parker.

<blank>

With a trembling hand, Parker finally grabbed it. With trembling hands, he snapped it open from the middle.

<blank>

It is a small ampoule that fits in your hand.

Parker tips the broken ampoule into his mouth and pours its contents in one gulp.

<blank>

"--------!"

<blank>

Parker's complexion grows redder as he gulps down the contents of the ampoule, his club still propped against the cobblestones.

In fact, the blood flow increased more than necessary, and the blood vessels in my head began to appear. The redness of his face, which looked as if it had been boiled, turned black.

<blank>

This is great! This is awesome! This is awesome, Mr. Fluke!

Of course. After all, it's a 'keeper'."

<blank>

But Parker's tension is unusually high despite such fearless changes.

Fluke, in response, is somewhat proud of himself. There is not a trace of tension in his voice.

<blank>

<blank>

But Lucille was moving against these gaping men.

<blank>

The magic was used as a surprise attack, and the game started at the pace of the opponent, but this opening was not to be missed.

<blank>

Lucille lowered herself, ran through their blind spot, and swung her dagger as hard as she could at Parker.

<blank>

?

<blank>

But the dagger did not reach Parker.

The dagger had been grabbed firmly by Fluke's left hand as it was held out haphazardly in front of Parker.

<blank>

What? What is it?"

<blank>

Parker notices Fluke's arm, held out in front of him, a beat later, and lets out a pause.

<blank>

Do you really think these toys are going to help?"

<blank>

Fluke paid no attention to Parker, who lifted Lucille's arm with the dagger in his grip and lifted the corners of his mouth disgustedly.
