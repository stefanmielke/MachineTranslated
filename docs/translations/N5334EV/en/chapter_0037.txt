# Episode 37: Suzy Cloud Charges!

Suzy side.

----------------

<b>

This morning's running practice is really paying off.

Even at this speed, I can run without causing any damage around me.

I'm amazing!

<b>

For now, I've cleared the path to the temple up to this point.

I have to keep the path clean for Mr. Henry! I'm tidying up everything I see.

<b>

I just blew up two little dogs.

That's the 21st one.

And 18 bats.

A considerable number have infiltrated the entire village.

There are over 200 dogs alone, and at least 300 bats.

<b>

<b>

It feels less like they're rampaging chaotically and more like they're moving in an organized manner.

I think it's safe to assume there’s a leader?

Those few at the edge of the forest are probably the main ones.

<b>

But more dangerous than that are the large groups lurking in this forest!

I absolutely have to do something about this!

They don't seem to be moving yet, but I need to crush them quickly!

<b>

Overall, the path to the temple has been cleared.

Mr. Henry shouldn't be attacked anymore.

All that's left is to clean up the trash clinging to the temple!!

There are 8 bats and 15 dogs at the temple!!

What a number in one place!

<b>

I kicked off the ground and jumped towards the temple.

My skirt flapped wildly in the wind, making noise.

But my skirt won't fly up!

It's a lady's decorum!!

<b>

<b>

I approached the temple from above, descending in a large arc.

I'm going at quite a speed.

<b>

I unleashed sword energy at the bats from above.

One, two, three, four, five shots.

I fired them continuously without pause.

In an instant, five bats exploded.

I then descended through the bats, swinging my sword to slash three more as I passed by.

That takes care of the bats!

<b>

There were dogs in my landing spot, so I kicked one away just before landing to secure my landing area.

I twisted my body and slashed the surrounding dogs with my sword.

With the momentum, I dug my boots into the ground and landed perfectly!

Isn't a score of 10.00 certain? I crushed five dogs with that landing, so I might get some technique points?!

<b>

I kicked off the ground and quickly moved in a low stance.

I sliced through the dogs swarming around the temple with my dual swords.

Only three remained attached to the front door, and they finally noticed my presence, turning their noses towards me, but… it was too late.

By that time, I had already reached the door.

Of course, I had already cut down the three.

<b>

Yeah, I think it took about three seconds to land inside the temple grounds?

With that, all the magical beasts around the temple have been dealt with.

<b>

Now, only Ms. Daisy is inside the temple.

Is she safe?! There should have been dogs at the door, but for some reason, the thick door of the temple is unscathed.

<b>

I sheathed my two swords in the sword belt and approached the door.

As I reached out to the door, I felt a slight resistance just before contact.

Oh, could this be a protective barrier? Is that why the door is unharmed?

Anyway, I knocked on the door and called out to Ms. Daisy.

<b>

"Su, Suzy? Is that you?! Where's Henry?! Is it safe outside?! Is Henry okay?!!"

<b>

It seems the teacher is safe.

It appears she has been continuously channeling magical power into the temple's barrier device, allowing her to withstand it.

<b>

"Mr. Henry will arrive soon. Ms. Daisy, please wait just a little longer."

<b>

I informed Ms. Daisy that Mr. Henry was safe and that I had secured the way back ahead of time.

I told her I was heading home and tried to leave the temple, but… I was stopped when she grabbed my hand.

<b>

"Suzy! What about the school… the children… is everyone okay?! … Oh, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you that. You just returned to the village, so you wouldn't know… I'm sorry."

<b>

I was taken aback by the sudden question.

But it seemed the teacher quickly realized and released my hand, weakly pulling it back to her chest, looking down apologetically.

<b>

"It's okay, teacher. Everyone is fine. I will make sure to protect everyone!"

<b>

I smiled at the teacher to reassure her.

I don't know if that eased her anxiety, but… it's all I can do for her right now… it's pathetic, but it's all I can do.

<b>

<b>

So I hurried home.

To get to school as soon as possible!

<b>

Because Sonia Mama is at home in a wheelchair!

She said she was fine in the morning, but she looked like she was in pain!

I can tell our home is surrounded!

I have to hurry! I need to get back quickly!!

<b>

I haven't even reached the hill leading to home yet.

But I can tell! There are 7 dogs and 5 bats!

I can see Sonia Mama is in front of the terrace!

Why?! Why is she outside?!

Is Elrose-san in front of Sonia Mama?

Is she protecting Mama?

Gilberto-san is going towards the dogs?!

<b>

No! Hurry! Move faster!! If I don't hurry, I won't make it!!

A dog is jumping at Mama!!

No! No! Stop it!! Noooooo!!!!!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

I thought my speed was fast.

<b>

Since coming to this world, I've been moving with incredible physical abilities, feeling like I can move faster and stronger than anything else.

I even started to think there was nothing I couldn't do.

<b>

But no! No!! Why am I so slow?!

Please, let me make it in time!!

<b>

If I get too cocky, I'll definitely be tripped up from an unexpected direction.

<b>

I know that from 30 years of life experience!

I should have learned that lesson many times over!

Why can't I use my experience?

Why do I keep repeating this?!

And to come in such an irretrievable form is just cruel!!

Please! Please don't take Mama away from me!! Please! I'm begging you!!!!!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

At that moment, as I reached the top of the hill to my home, what came into view was the scene where the dog's fangs were just about to reach Sonia Mama.

<b>

It felt like slow motion.

The fangs were closing in on Mama.

I thrust my sword forward to unleash the sword energy I had gripped.

It should have been a momentary movement, but my body felt terribly slow.

It felt like something was sticking to my body; I should be able to move faster, but my arms wouldn't go forward as I wished.

<b>

And just a moment before the sword could be thrust forward...

<b>

<b>

<b>

The dog's skull was crushed.

<b>

"...Huh?"

<b>

Elrose-san had struck the dog's head with a blunt weapon that looked like a tonfa.

<b>

The dog's body bounced off the ground with the force of the blow to its head, scattering brain matter everywhere.

Its neck twisted in an unnatural direction, and it bounced away from Sonia Mama, rolling to the ground.

<b>

"Eh? Huh? Huhhhh??"

<b>

As for Sonia Mama… she was sitting in her wheelchair, calmly gazing at the garden ahead as if nothing had happened…

<b>

She was drawing her bow!

What the heck??! Why?! 

<b>

With her left hand, she held the bow and with her right hand, she drew the arrow, but… she had two more arrows in her right hand, separate from the one nocked on the bow.

<b>

With a smooth motion, she shot three arrows in quick succession without pause.

<b>

The released arrows pierced and shot down three bats that were in the air as if they were sucked in.

<b>

Sonia Mama then pulled out the next arrow from behind her wheelchair and shot another three arrows in quick succession, taking down two bats and one dog in rapid succession.

It seems Sonia Mama is wrapping magical power around the arrows when she releases them, significantly increasing their power.

<b>

That's right! What about Gilberto-san?!

When I looked towards where I remembered him going…

Gilberto-san was running low to the ground between the dogs, wielding a longsword in his right hand and a dagger in his left, moving with incredible speed as he swiftly dispatched two dogs.

<b>

Wow! What was that? That movement!

It's a sharp and precise maneuver that I couldn't have imagined from his usual carefree demeanor?!

<b>

There were three dogs left.

Two of them were instantly killed by Sonia Mama's arrows, and the remaining one was easily taken down by a rapid series of strikes from Elrose-san's tonfa.

<b>

Elrose-san's movements were also incredibly graceful and powerful!

It's hard to believe that this is the same person who usually carries herself so elegantly!

<b>

<b>

What is this? What is going on?

I was almost stunned by the overwhelming situation, but I looked around and moved forward.

<b>

It seems there were more magical beasts than I initially confirmed.

There were a total of 14 dogs.

And 12 bats were lying around.

So this is Amukamu...

This is the potential of the warrior tribe Amukamu!

<b>

<b>

Confusion, relief, and disbelief mixed together, putting me in a somewhat delicate psychological state, but still, seeing Sonia Mama safe made me feel relieved and happy, and I couldn't help but run over.

<b>

"Sonia Mama!!"

"Suzy?! Oh my! Suzy! What happened?! Did you just arrive?"

"Mom! Sonia Mama!! I'm so glad you're safe! Sonia Mama!!"

<b>

I rushed over to the wheelchair and hugged Sonia Mama.

Is it cramped for her to be hugged like this while sitting in a wheelchair? Is it uncomfortable?

<b>

But I'm so happy. I'm relieved. I thought I wouldn't be able to see Sonia Mama again...

Oh no, I feel like I'm going to cry...

<b>

The smell and warmth of Sonia Mama make me feel so at ease.

I'm sorry, please let me stay like this for just a little longer.

<b>

<b>

"Suzy... were you worried about me?"

<b>

Sonia Mama asked while gently stroking my head.

I nodded while burying my face in her lap.

I really was, really worried!

<b>

"Thank you, Suzy. I'm sorry for making you worry..."

<b>

I shook my head.

It's not like that! I'm just glad you're safe!

I replied by moving my neck while still burying my face.

If I look at her face, I'll definitely cry!

<b>

"...Suzy, ...hey? Suzy?"

<b>

Sonia Mama asked with a happy voice while gently stroking my hair.

I tightened my grip on her hand and pressed my face against her even more, answering.

<b>

"You just called me... Mama, didn't you? Sonia Mama."

<b>

I froze for a moment!

Oh no! I shouldn't have let that slip out so suddenly!!

I usually call her that in my heart, but I've never said it out loud before!!

This is bad! This is super embarrassing!

I hope she doesn't think I'm being too forward!

It's okay, right? Oh no! I can't lift my face!

<b>

"Suzy, could you say it one more time? Please, Suzy."

<b>

Ugh... so embarrassing...

It's embarrassing, but Sonia Mama keeps asking, "Please" while stroking my hair.

It seems she doesn't think I'm being too forward, but still, it's embarrassing, so I hesitantly lifted my face...

<b>

"...Sonia Mama."

<b>

I tried my best to say it.

My face must be bright red right now.

<b>

<b>

Then Sonia Mama hugged me tightly.

<b>

"Thank you, Suzy! Thank you! I'm so happy, Suzy... truly happy!"

<b>

She hugged me and rubbed her cheek against mine, repeatedly saying how happy she was.

Eventually, Sonia Mama turned to Elrose-san and Gilberto-san, who had come nearby, with a beaming expression.

<b>

"Look! Elrose, Gilberto! This is my daughter! My daughter Suzy!"

<b>

She joyfully announced to the two of them.

<b>

The two responded, "We are aware, madam... It's wonderful to see you, young lady..." with narrowed eyes.

Oh, Sonia Mama's eyes are glistening...

As I leaned my head against her shoulder while being hugged, an overwhelming feeling of happiness welled up inside me.

<b>

But right now, I don't have time to bask in this happiness.

Reluctantly, I pulled away from Sonia Mama.

She seemed reluctant to let go, stretching her hand towards me until it could no longer reach.

<b>

"Sonia Mama, I'm going."

<b>

I said that and drew my sword from the sword belt, pointing it towards the bushes in the garden and unleashing sword energy.

<b>

The released sword energy instantly exploded the dog that was there.

<b>

The adults watching gasped in surprise, but I went right up to the exploded dog, crouched down, and picked up the small creature that was unable to move, breathing heavily.

<b>

<b>

I cupped it in my hands and returned to where the mamas were.

Elrose-san came over and peered at the little one.

<b>

"Young lady, what is this?"

<b>

I replied.

<b>

"This is Algernon. Bibi's... familiar."

<b>

Yes, this is Bibi's Algernon.

Its body was covered in wounds.

There were several places where its skin was torn, as if it had been gouged by fangs.

Its beautiful white fur was stained bright red.

<b>

Did you come to get me? Did you come to call for help even in this condition?

<b>

Elrose-san sadly murmured, "This one won't last much longer..."

<b>

Yeah, this one is beyond saving. There's no time for treatment now.

<b>

So "treatment" won't do.

<b>

That's why I will use my innate "Heal."

<b>

Now that I think about it, this is the first time I've used "Heal" since coming here.

Rejoice, Algernon. You will be the first one I heal in this world.

<b>

I placed Algernon in my left hand and raised my right hand to chant "Heal."

<b>

A pillar of light appeared around Algernon, enveloping him.

Sparkling particles of light danced and gathered towards Algernon.

<b>

<b>

The adults were watching in awe, holding their breath.

Eventually, all the light converged on Algernon and then disappeared.

Immediately, Algernon regained consciousness, sniffing and moving around on my palm as if checking his body.

He seemed to have fully healed and recovered.

<b>

"Y-Young lady! W-What is this?! ...What is happening?!!"

<b>

Elrose-san, who usually maintains a poker face and rarely shows emotion, was half in shock, staring at Algernon.

Gilberto-san kept repeating, "As expected of the young lady! Indeed! Truly impressive!!" for some reason.

Sonia Mama seemed surprised with wide eyes, but for some reason, she nodded in understanding.

<b>

Then, Algernon kept making sounds as if he was trying to communicate with me.

<b>

"Eh? What are you... eh? You want to go with me, right...? Eh?"

<b>

For some reason, it felt like Algernon was saying he wanted to take me with him.

<b>

"I see, so that little one is a familiar? That's what it is."

<b>

Sonia Mama seemed to understand something, but I tilted my head in confusion.

<b>

"That's fine, Suzy. Go follow that little one. And... as the daughter of the Cloud family, make sure to protect everyone properly."

<b>

Sonia Mama straightened her posture and told me that.

In response, I turned to face Sonia Mama.

<b>

"Yes, I will definitely help everyone."

"Yes, I know you don't need me to worry about you... but still, be careful."

"Yes."

"You'll surely come back hungry, right? So I'll prepare some herb chicken for you. Come back as soon as you can."

"Yes!!"

<b>

I couldn't help but smile widely as I replied.

Algernon also let out a loud cry in response to me.

<b>

At that moment, my body was enveloped in light centered around Algernon.

And just like that, my vision went white.

<b>

...What the hell!!
