# 37 Suzy Cloud Runs!

Suzy SIDE.


----------------

<blank>

I know this is helping with the running every morning.

Even at this speed, I'm able to run completely unharmed by the surroundings.

I'm amazing!

<blank>

At any rate, we have cleared the road to the temple so far.

I have to keep the path that Dr. Henry walks on clean! I'm tidying up from the edges that I see.

<blank>

Even now, I've had two dogs blow up.

This is the 21st fish.

The bat is 18.

Quite a few of them have infiltrated the entire village.

The total number of dogs alone is over 200, and when it comes to bats, there are at least 300.

<blank>

<blank>

It's not so much that they're running around in a disorderly fashion, but rather that they're organized.

Am I correct in assuming that there will be a leader first?

These guys in small numbers at the edge of the forest are probably the main players.

<blank>

But what's worse is the hordes that lurk in these woods!

If we don't do something about this, we are definitely in trouble!

It doesn't seem to be working yet, but it needs to be shut down ASAP!

<blank>

Generally, the road to the temple was clean.

The teacher should not be attacked anymore.

All that remains...is to clean up the trash that is clinging to the temple!

Bat 8 in the temple, dog 15!

What a number in one place!

<blank>

With a ba-ba-ba, he kicked the ground toward the temple and leaped up.

Flap, flap, flap, the skirt is violently agitated by the wind, making noise.

But the skirt won't be rolled up!

It's a girl's best friend!

<blank>

<blank>

It descends and approaches the temple from the sky in a wide arc.

That's pretty fast.

<blank>

Shoots sword ki at the bat from above.

One, two, three, four, five shots.

He released them in rapid succession without pause.

In an instant, five bats explode and scatter.

He descends through the bats, passing three bats as he passes by, swinging his sword and slashing wildly at them.

This is the end of the bat!

<blank>

Since there were dogs in the landing area and they were in the way, he kicked one of them away just before landing to secure the landing site.

He then twisted his body around and slashed the dogs around him with his sword.

He killed the momentum of the attached by drilling the ground with his boot and landed beautifully!

10.00 is a solid 10.00, isn't it? The dog also crushed 5 dogs on this landing, so maybe the technical points add up?

<blank>

Kick the ground as it is and move quickly in a low position.

The dogs swarming around the temple are chopped up from one end to the other with two swords in each hand.

Only three of them were left attached to the front door. They finally noticed my presence and turned their noses toward me, but... it was too late.

By then I had already reached the door.

Of course, after three of them were cut down.

<blank>

Yeah, I'd say 3 seconds after landing on the temple grounds.

Now all the demonic beasts around the temple have been cleared.

<blank>

Right now, the only person in the temple is Dr. Daisy.

Is the doctor okay? The dog must have been attached to the door, but somehow the temple's thick door is intact.

<blank>

He puts the two swords in the sheaths of his sword belt and heads for the door.

As I reached for the door, I felt a slight resistance just before contact.

Oh, by any chance is this a protective ward? So the door is intact?

Anyway, I knocked on the door and called out to Dr. Daisy.

<blank>

"Suzy, Suzy? You're Suzy, aren't you? Where's Henry? Where's Henry? Is everything okay out there? Is Henry okay?

<blank>

The doctor seems to be safe.

Apparently, the temple's warding device kept the magic flowing and was able to withstand it.

<blank>

Dr. Henry will be here shortly. Miss Daisy, please wait just a little longer."

<blank>

To Dr. Daisy, that Dr. Henry was safe and that I was ahead of him and had made my way home.

I told him that I was on my way to the temple in a hurry.

I told him I was going home and was about to leave the temple, but he held my hand and stopped me.

<blank>

'Susie...where's the school...where's the kids...where's everyone? The school... the children... everyone? Is everyone all right? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You just came back to the village, you couldn't possibly know... I'm sorry.

<blank>

I was puzzled by the sudden question, though.

Immediately the teacher pulled his hand away as if he had noticed, pulled it back with no effort, held it to his chest, and looked down apologetically.

<blank>

He said, "Sir, it's all right. Everyone will be fine. I'll protect you all, I'll protect you all!

<blank>

I smiled at him to reassure him.

I don't know if that helped him to get rid of his anxiety...but it's the only thing I can do for him now...it's pathetic, but it's all I can do right now.

<blank>

<blank>

So I rushed to the house.

To head to school as soon as possible!

<blank>

Because now you have Sonia-mama in a wheelchair at home!

He said he was fine in the morning, but it looked painful!

You can see that your house is surrounded now!

Quickly! I have to get back soon!

<blank>

We haven't even reached the hillside of your house yet.

But I know! There are 7 dogs and 5 bats!

I know that Sonia Mama is in front of the terrace!

Why? Why are you out there?

Is Ms. Elrose in front of Sonia Mama?

Are you defending your mom?

Did Mr. Gilberto go to the dog?

<blank>

No, no, no! Hurry! Hurry! If you don't hurry, we won't make it in time!

One dog is jumping at mom!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No! No! No! ！！！！

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I thought I was fast.

<blank>

When I came to this world, I felt I could move around with incredible physical ability, and could get around quicker and stronger than any object.

I was even beginning to think that maybe there was nothing I couldn't do.

<blank>

But no! But no! Why am I so slow?

Please, please, please make it in time!

<blank>

If you are in a good mood and buy a drink, you will definitely get your foot in the door from a place you never imagined.

<blank>

That's a habit I know from 30 years of lived life experience!

I'm sure you've been reminded of this over and over again!

Why can't I take advantage of the experience?

Why repeat it again?

And it's terrible that it comes in a way that can't be undone!

Please! Please don't take my mom away from me! Please! Please! ！！！！

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, I climbed up the hillside of your house and what I saw was the sight of the dog's fangs just about to close in on Mama Sonia.

<blank>

It is as if in slow motion.

Fangs close in on Mom.

I thrust forward to send the ki of the sword in my grip flying.

It should really be an instantaneous movement, but it feels terribly slow.

It was as if something was sticking to my body, and I should be able to move faster, but my arms were not moving forward as I wanted them to.

<blank>

And a moment sooner than the sword moves forward. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The dog's cranium was crushed.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

Elrose hit the dog on the head with a blunt object like a tonfa in his hand.

<blank>

The dog's body bounced heavily on the ground from the force of the blow to the head, scattering brain plasma from the ruptured head.

It twisted its neck in a strange direction, bounced away from Sonia-mama, and then rolled and fell to the ground.

<blank>

"Huh? Huh? Eeeeeeeee?"

<blank>

As for Mama Sonia, she was sitting in her wheelchair, quietly staring out into the garden with a calm expression on her face, as if nothing had happened.

<blank>

He drew his bow and squeezed!

What the hell? Whyhhhhhh?

<blank>

He holds the bow with his left hand and draws the arrow with his right hand...but he has two more arrows in his right hand, in addition to the arrow that is attached to the bow.

<blank>

With a fluid motion, he shot three arrows in rapid succession without a pause.

<blank>

The arrows were released and shot down through the three bats in the air as if they were sucked in.

<blank>

Soniamama went on to pull the next arrow from the back of her wheelchair and shot another three arrows in a row, knocking down two bats and a dog in quick succession.

It seems that when she shoots an arrow, Sonia-mama imbues the arrow with magic power from the fingers of her left hand, which hold the bow, greatly increasing the power of the arrow.

<blank>

Yes, it is! Mr. Gilbert is!

I remembered and looked in the direction I was heading....

Gilberto ran through the dogs with a low posture as if he were on the ground, and with a long sword in his right hand and a dagger in his left, he swung it around at great speed, slaughtering two of the dogs in a single bound.

<blank>

Wow! What's that? That move!

I can't imagine how sharp and sharp he is from his usual aloofness!

<blank>

There are three dogs left.

Two of them were instantly killed by Sonia Mama's arrows, and the one that remained was also sunk by a barrage of Elrose's tonfers, which came forward like a whammy.

<blank>

E, Elrose's movements are also amazingly brilliant and powerful!

The movement of this person is not what you would expect from a person who usually behaves in a neat and elegant manner!

<blank>

<blank>

What is this? What is this?

I was a little too stunned to look around, but I looked around and moved forward.

<blank>

Apparently, there were more magical beasts than I had first confirmed.

The total number of dogs is 14.

There are also 12 bats lying around.

This is Amcam or .......

Is this the potential of the villagers of Amkam, a fighting people?

<blank>

<blank>

I'm in a bit of a delicate state of mind, a mixture of confusion, relief, and dismay...but still, I'm so relieved and happy to see Sonia's mom safe and sound again that I can't help but run over to her.

<blank>

Sonia Mom!

Susie? Well! Suzy! What's wrong? Did you just get here?

Mama! Sonia mama! Thank God, thank God you're safe! Sonia-mama!

<blank>

I ran up to the wheelchair and hugged Mama Sonia just like that.

Would it be too tight for Sonia-mama if she were sitting in a wheelchair and I just hugged her? Would it be painful?

<blank>

But I'm happy. I was relieved. Because I thought it was already over...I thought I would never see Sonia-mama again....

Oh, no, I'm going to cry. ......

<blank>

The smell of Sonia's mother and her body warmth made me feel very relaxed.

Sorry, let me stay like this just a little while longer.

<blank>

<blank>

'Suzy...are you worried about me?'

<blank>

Sonia-mama asks while patting my head.

I nodded yes with my face buried in Sonia's lap.

I was really, really worried!

<blank>

Thank you Susie. I'm sorry I made you worry..."

<blank>

I shake my head.

That's not true! It's okay because you're safe!

I still keep my face buried and reply with a movement of my neck.

Because I would definitely cry if I saw your face!

<blank>

"...Susie, hey? Susie?"

<blank>

Sonia-mama gently strokes my hair and asks me in a happy voice, "What is it that you want me to do?

I'm like... Hm? What is it?　I answer by pressing my face against the hand that clings to me, as if to pamper it a little more.

<blank>

You just called me...mama, didn't you? Sonia Mama."

<blank>

I froze in my tracks!

Hahhhh! That's not good! It just came out of my mouth on the spur of the moment!

I usually call them in my mind, but I had never called them by name before.

Oh no~~! This is so embarrassing!

I hope they don't think I'm being too generous or anything.

It's all good, right? Eeeee~n! I can't raise my face!

<blank>

"Susie, can you call me again, just one more time? Okay? Please, Suzy."

<blank>

Ugh...so embarrassing....

It was embarrassing, but Mama Sonia kept saying please and stroking my hair.

At any rate, they don't seem to think I'm being thick...but I'm still embarrassed, so I look up at them fearfully...

<blank>

Sonia, Mama.

<blank>

I tried my best to call it.

I am sure my face is red right now.

<blank>

<blank>

Then, Sonia Mom hugged me tightly.

<blank>

Thank you, Susie! Thank you! I'm so happy, Susie... so happy!"

<blank>

He hugs me, rubs his cheek against me, and tells me how happy he is so many times.

Soon, Sonia-mama was smiling at Elrose and Gilberto, who had come to her side....

<blank>

Look! Elrose, Gilbert! It's my daughter! It's my daughter Suzy!"

<blank>

He told them so happily.

<blank>

I know who you two are, ma'am...　　Good evening, miss..." they both said, squinting at me.　they said, squinting their eyes at me.

Oh, Sonia Mama's eyes are moist...

When I rest my head on my mom's shoulder and hug her, I am filled with a very happy feeling.

<blank>

But now is not the time to bask in the afterglow of this happiness.

I backed away from Sonia-mama with a feeling of being pulled back.

Mom, too, is reluctant to leave me, and extends her hand to my cheek until I can't reach it anymore.

<blank>

Sonia, Mom, I have to go.

<blank>

With that I pulled my sword from my sword belt, pointed it at the end of a bush in the garden, and fired my sword ki.

<blank>

The sword ki that was released instantly exploded the dog that was there.

<blank>

The adults who were watching were wide-eyed and amazed!　I walked up to the dog that had set off the explosion, bent down, and picked up the little creature, which was breathing heavily and unable to move.

<blank>

<blank>

He places it in his palm as if scooping it up with both hands and returns to his moms.

Mr. Elrose came to the side and looked into the child.

<blank>

"Miss, what's this?"

<blank>

He asked.

<blank>

Algernon. Bibi's... follower."

<blank>

Yes, this is Bibi's Algernon.

There are scars all over the body.

The skin was torn here and there, and there were several marks that looked as if they had been gouged out by fangs.

The white fur, which had been beautiful, had turned bright red.

<blank>

Did you come for me? Did you come to call for help in spite of all this?

<blank>

Elrose-san said sadly, "This one won't hold anymore....　he muttered sadly.

<blank>

Yeah, this is no longer good. We can't make it with the allowance anymore.

<blank>

Yes, 'handouts' will not do.

<blank>

So use the 'heel' that you have.

<blank>

Come to think of it, this is the first time I've used "heel" since I came over here.

Rejoice, Algernon. You're going to be my first heel in this world, aren't you?

<blank>

I placed Algernon on my left hand, held out my right hand and chanted "Heal.

<blank>

A pillar of light appears and surrounds Algernon.

Sparkling particles of light dance and gather at Algernon.

<blank>

<blank>

The adults gulped and stared at the scene.

Eventually, all the lights converge on Algernon, and then disappear.

Algernon, who immediately came back to consciousness, sniffed and moved around on my palm as if checking his body here and there.

He seems to be safe, his wounds are completely healed and he has made a full recovery.

<blank>

Oh, miss! This, this! ...is this?!

<blank>

Elrose, who normally has a poker face and does not show much expression, stares at Algernon in surprise, looking half distraught.

Gilberto is indeed a lady! Mm! As expected!　and for some reason, he kept saying 'as expected'.

Sonia Mom also seemed surprised with her eyes wide open, but for some reason she nodded her head in agreement.

<blank>

And then Algernon came squeaking and squeaking, as if he was talking to me.

<blank>

What? What are you...? What? With you? Are you saying you're taking me with you? What?

<blank>

For some reason, I felt as if Algernon was telling me that he was taking me with him.

<blank>

"Oh, so she's a follower? That's what I mean.

<blank>

Sonia mom seems to know what's going on...but I can't help but tilt my head.

<blank>

It's okay, Susie. Go with her. And...as the daughter of the Cloud family, protect them well."

<blank>

Sonia Mama straightened her posture and told me so.

With that, I too turned to Sonia-mama.

<blank>

Yes, I will save everyone, I promise.

Yes, I know I don't need to worry about you, but still, be careful."

Yes."

I'm sure you'll come home hungry. I'll prepare the herb bird for you. So come back as soon as you can.

Yes!

<blank>

I couldn't hold back my happiness and replied with a big smile.

Algernon joined in with me and let out one loud squeal.

<blank>

At the same time, my body was enveloped in a light centered on Algernon.

And just like that, his vision went into a whiteout.
