# Chapter 22: Suzy Cloud's Midnight Investigation

≪Invisible Move≫

A skill of the Enchant Channeler.

For a certain period, it erases one's presence, preventing preemptive attacks from mobs.

The state is解除される by taking any action against a mob.

<b>

<b>

In the dead of night, Suzy, who had vanished using her skill, headed towards the forest.

<b>

She temporarily changed into D equipment indoors, used her skill, and exited through the window.

While the skill was in use, her presence was unrecognized by anyone, allowing her to advance deep into the forest without being noticed by the people of the Cloud residence or the villagers on night watch.

<b>

After about 15 minutes of leaving the house, she arrived at the last water source where she had camped.

It was located approximately 20 kilometers from the village.

<b>

"It hasn't even been a week since then... but it feels like it was ages ago."

<b>

Standing at the spot where she last pitched her tent, she gazed at the river's flow and murmured with deep emotion.

<b>

"I wore the 'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes' here, didn't I?"

<b>

Saying this, she changed her equipment from D equipment to the 'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes.'

<b>

The 'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes,' which had been torn by a rabbit and was in tatters from running around the forest, had been washed and repaired with Elrose's beautiful needlework.

<b>

"Putting it on again like this feels a bit nostalgic?"

<b>

She stroked the mended areas, confirming them as she murmured.

Then she changed into the nightwear she had worn in her room.

<b>

"And this nightwear has been 'stored in the inventory'—how mysterious!"

<b>

She had tried to store various items in her inventory but had failed every time.

Mobs she had defeated, small items, clothes, shoes, tools, and even a slice of cherry pie... none of them could be stored.

<b>

<b>

She took off her nightwear and was left in just her shorts.

She attempted to store the nightwear in her inventory, but... it didn't work.

<b>

She put the nightwear back on and changed to D equipment.

This time, both the nightwear and shorts were stored in the inventory together.

<b>

"So, if it's an exchange with stored equipment, then even new items can be stored... maybe?"

<b>

She changed back into the 'Village Girl's Everyday Clothes' once more.

<b>

<b>

"I was able to store the water in the event item jar. I haven't tried it yet, but if I put items in the jar, can they also be stored?"

<b>

She equipped a G0 weapon with a clank.

Continuing to change her equipment from A to D, she finally stored the weapon and ended up unarmed.

<b>

<b>

"Also, it seems like storage numbers and weight limits are being ignored, right? Maybe these items don't exist as physical objects? It's like they are just data somewhere..."

<b>

She equipped the G0 dual blades again.

<b>

"When I say 'data,' it feels like I'm still in a game, but... hmmm... is that really the case? The inventory is just too much of a mystery for me right now! Enough! I'll put off what I don't understand for later! Procrastination!!"

<b>

She switched from G0 equipment back to her nightwear and struck a victory pose.

<b>

<b>

"So! The main event tonight is the magic verification..."

<b>

She took out a weapon from her inventory and re-equipped the 'Beginner's Dagger,' one of the beginner's gear she started with in the game.

<b>

"This one has the weakest magical power, but the staff I used today is even weaker... If I can get that, I'll use that next time."

<b>

She infused magical power into the dagger.

<b>

"Hmm... even so, this one seems easier to control the magical power."

<b>

She cast magic at a tree on the opposite bank.

<b>

<b>

≪Air Strike≫

The initial attack skill for all magic professions.

A wind attribute attack magic that shoots compressed air bullets at enemies.

<b>

<b>

The tree hit by the air bullet was gouged out in a circular shape about one meter wide in the middle, and the upper part cracked and fell to the ground, taking surrounding trees with it.

<b>

A mob that had been waiting on a branch to attack was blown apart by the direct hit of the air bullet.

<b>

"With the weakest equipment and the weakest magic, this much power... Next, I'll try to shoot with the weakest magical power possible."

<b>

<b>

Just like she did earlier, she imagined infusing just a drop of magical power into the weapon... and shot. The second mob had a large hole opened in its torso. Its body was torn in two and fell to the ground.

<b>

"Even weakened, this power... Can I make it even weaker? That's something to practice."

<b>

<b>

She noticed the surrounding trees rustling, and many mobs were gathering.

<b>

"Is that a 'Yellow Ape'? They weren't around here before. The number is... 20. Looks like a swarm. They seem to be coming from deeper in the forest. Then!"

<b>

One of the reasons she came here. Magical beasts that come from deeper than the mid-layer, as Howard said. If they encroach, she would exterminate them.

<b>

She had already wiped out most of the mobs near the village due to her own blunders.

If excessively strong magical beasts from elsewhere encroach in that gap, it could cause serious damage to the village.

She felt it was her responsibility to do something about it.

<b>

<b>

This time, she infused a bit more magical power and aimed for the center of the swarm to shoot.

<b>

A wide area of trees in the forest was knocked down.

A massive air bullet gouged out an area with a diameter of 10 meters.

Most of the swarm was caught in it and blown away.

<b>

Those that didn't take a direct hit were not safe either.

They were swept away by the wind pressure and blown away along with the trees.

<b>

"Whoa! Just adding a bit more power resulted in several times the destructive power!? 'Air Strike' is supposed to be a single-target attack, right!? This isn't just a matter of doubling the magical power! This is bad! I really need to learn how to control the power, or I'll destroy the village!"

<b>

<b>

Imagining her carelessness turning the village into ruins made her want to cry.

<b>

"Ah, could it be that the magic I used at the mountain top also had its power boosted too much? If I was able to achieve that level of power with a sword that has poor magical efficiency, what would have happened if I used a staff?? This is bad! I absolutely can't use anything higher than that elemental burst type! If I'm not careful, I could gouge a star! I could become like Frieza!! Sealed! Sealed! Absolutely sealed!!"

<b>

She found herself getting flustered but placed her hand on her chest, took a deep breath, and regained her composure.

<b>

"For now, I won't use my own high-level attack magic. If I do, I'll stick to the spirit magic taught at school for the basics. I'll learn to control it here by using weak magic little by little."

<b>

<b>

Spirit magic is a method that allows for significant effects with a small amount of magical power by ordering spirits.

<b>

In contrast, the magic she uses directly orders the ether.

<b>

While this consumes more magical power, the effects are considerably greater compared to spirit magic. The changes in effect based on the increase or decrease in magical power are evident from what she just witnessed.

<b>

For the people of this world, taking the approach of directly appealing to the ether must be quite difficult, given the limited amount of magic they can use.

<b>

In this world, converting magical power or MP into numbers seems to have little meaning, but if she were to do it anyway...

<b>

The MP that people here possess is probably not more than '20' at most.

Henry probably has around '15'? Beatrice and Mia likely have '5' or '6'.

<b>

Spirit magic can be used with a consumption of 1 MP.

This means that Beatrice and the others can use magic 5 or 6 times a day.

<b>

In contrast, the magic she uses consumes a lot of MP.

The 'Air Strike' she just used has the weakest power and the minimum consumption of 15 MP.

However, that consumption makes it difficult for the people of this world to use it.

<b>

Mia and Beatrice wouldn't be able to use it either.

<b>

Furthermore, her MP amount is likely in the five digits due to the passive effects of being a magic profession.

<b>

"There's no doubt that it's bottomless..."

<b>

She felt a slight dizziness and placed her fingers on her forehead.

The feeling of being in a world with fundamentally different setting principles was overwhelming.

<b>

"Well, I just have to adjust and adapt to it. It seems tough, but I have to make it work somehow!"

<b>

As long as she lives in this world, she has to adjust to its common sense.

<b>

After all, what she aims for is to be an inconspicuous commoner!

She must search for ways to restrain herself so as not to stand out even a little!!

<b>

<b>

"Now then! I can't take too long, so I should do a quick patrol! ...And when I'm done, it's okay to reward myself, right? Since I'm in a nice, open place with no people around... right? Hehe!"

<b>

She giggled and began to blush slightly, fidgeting.

<b>

"Alright! Let's finish this quickly and get on with it!! Yes! Let's do it!!"

<b>

She dashed out as if she couldn't wait.

She seemed eager to get something done.

Whether she truly intends to restrain herself is highly questionable.

<b>

----------------

Highly questionable indeed!! w
