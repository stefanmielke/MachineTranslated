# 22 - Suzy Cloud Midnight Verification

≪'Invisible Moves'.

Enchantment Channeler Skills.

The presence of the object disappears for a certain period of time, making it impervious to preemptive attacks from mobs.

The condition is removed by taking an offensive action against the mob.

<blank>

<blank>

Late at night, Suzy disappeared with her skills and headed for the woods.

<blank>

Once indoors, I converted to D equipment and used my skills to go out the window.

Since no one would recognize my presence while I was using the skill, I proceeded deep into the forest, unnoticed not only by the people at the Cloud residence but also by the villagers who were on vigil in the forest late at night.

<blank>

Fifteen minutes after leaving the house, we arrived at the watering hole where we last camped.

The place is located approximately 20 kilometers from the village.

<blank>

It's been less than a week...and it feels like ages ago."

<blank>

Standing at the spot where he had last pitched his tent, he muttered emotionally as he watched the river flow by.

<blank>

You put on your 'village girl's everyday clothes' here."

<blank>

With that, he changes his equipment from D equipment to "village girl's normal clothes".

<blank>

The "village girl's everyday clothes," which had been ripped by a rabbit the other day and torn to shreds from running around in the forest, had been washed and repaired with Elrose's beautiful needlework.

<blank>

"It's very moving to see you dressed like this again, isn't it?"

<blank>

He stroked the mended marks and muttered to himself as he checked them.

And now he converts it into a nightgown that he wore in his room.

<blank>

And then I wondered why this nightgown was "stored" in my inventory!

<blank>

I've tried to store all kinds of things in my inventory and have failed at every attempt.

Slaughtered mobs, knick-knacks, clothes, shoes, tools, and a slice of cherry pie....

All of them could not store anything.

<blank>

<blank>

Take off your nightgown and go down to just a pair of shorts.

I try to store the nightgown in my hand in my inventory...but I can't.

<blank>

Put on your nightgown again and then convert to D equipment.

This time a set of nightgowns and shorts were stored in the inventory.

<blank>

"Does this mean that new equipment can be stored if it is exchanged for stored equipment?"

<blank>

I changed once again into my "village girl's normal clothes".

<blank>

<blank>

I have not tried it yet, but if I put an item in the jar, will it be possible to re-store this item as well? I haven't tried it yet, but if I put an item in the jar, will it be possible to store this one as well?"

<blank>

I'm going to try to equip a G0 weapon with a jackon.

He continued to change his equipment from A to D. Finally, he stowed his weapon and left it unarmed.

<blank>

<blank>

And they don't care about storage capacity or weight restrictions, do they? Maybe this thing doesn't exist as a substance? It's as if it just exists somewhere as data. ......

<blank>

Equip the G0 two swords again.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's still in the game, but...what about the data? Inventory is still too mysterious to me now! Enough already! I'll put off what I don't understand! Putting it off~~!

<blank>

I changed back to my nightgown from my G0 equipment and posed with a banzai and a hand up.

<blank>

<blank>

So! Tonight's main focus is magical verification, so ......"

<blank>

It is one of the beginner's equipment that you have at the beginning of the game "Beginner's dagger" to take the weapon out of your inventory and re-equip it.

<blank>

This one is the weakest in magic power, but the tact I used today is much weaker... If I get that one, I'll use that one this time."

<blank>

I go to the dagger and put magic power into it.

<blank>

I still think it's easier to control magic with this one."

<blank>

In the middle of one tree on the other side of the river, he releases a spell.

<blank>

<blank>

≪Air Strike≫.

Initial offensive skill for all magic professions.

It is a wind attribute attack magic that shoots compressed air bullets at the enemy.

<blank>

<blank>

The tree hit by the air bullet is gouged into a one-meter circle in the middle, and the upper part of the tree falls to the ground, winding around the surrounding trees.

<blank>

The mob, which had been riding on a branch and looking for the right moment to attack us, was shattered by a direct hit from an air bullet.

<blank>

The weakest magic with the weakest equipment is this powerful... Next time, let's try shooting with as little magic power as possible."

<blank>

<blank>

I shoot with the image of only a drop of water in the weapon, as I did today. The second one was pierced by a large hole in its torso, and its body was torn in two and fell to the ground.

<blank>

"Can you make it weaker and still have this power ......? It takes practice."

<blank>

<blank>

The trees around you are shaking, and you can see that many mobs have gathered.

<blank>

Yellow Ape". They haven't been around here before. They're coming from further in than this. Well, then!"

<blank>

Another reason to come here. The demonic beasts come from deeper than the middle level, as Mr. Howard says. If they invade, we will destroy them.

<blank>

Originally, the mobs near the village were roughly exterminated by my own screw-up.

If a stronger-than-necessary magical beast invades that gap from somewhere else, it could cause serious damage to the village.

I believe it is my responsibility to do something about it.

<blank>

<blank>

This time, he cages in a little more magic power and shoots at the center of the herd.

<blank>

Trees in the forest were knocked down over a wide area.

It is the mark of a huge air bullet, up to 10 meters in diameter, that has gouged it out.

Most of the herd was engulfed and obliterated.

<blank>

No one who did not receive a direct hit survived.

The wind pressure reaped them and blew them away, along with the trees.

<blank>

Choo! Just a little more baskets, but several times more destructive power! Air Strike" is supposed to be a single attack, right? If you double the amount of magic power, it will double the power. It's not like that! That's not good! If we don't learn to adjust the power, we'll destroy the village!

<blank>

<blank>

I almost cry when I imagine my carelessness and the ruins of my village.

<blank>

I was wondering if the magic I used at the top of the mountain was also ridiculously powerful because I put too much effort into it? If it was that powerful using a sword with poor magical efficiency, what would have happened if I had used a wand? Oh no! I can never use an elemental burst system higher than that! If it's bad, the stars will be gouged out! I'll end up like Fuuza-sama! Seal it, seal it! Definitely sealed!

<blank>

I was so distraught that I had to put my hand on my chest to breathe and regain my composure.

<blank>

I don't use my own higher level offensive magic for now. If we do, let's use the spirit magic taught at school to handle the basics. As for control, let's use weak magic here and learn to adjust it little by little."

<blank>

<blank>

Spirit magic is a method of ordering spirits to perform magic, which can be expected to have a great effect even with a small amount of magic value.

<blank>

In contrast, the magic I use from my own source is directly ordered through the ether.

<blank>

Although it consumes more magic power, the effect is much greater than that of spirit magic. The effects that change with the increase or decrease of the magic power used are as we have just seen.

<blank>

It would be very difficult for the people of this world to take this method of appealing directly to the ether, given the amount of magic available.

<blank>

In this world, I don't think it makes much sense to convert magic power, MP, etc. into numbers, but if I dare.

<blank>

The people here probably don't have "20" MP at most.

Henry is probably about a '15'? I think Beatrice, Mia and the others are 5 or 6.

<blank>

Spirit magic can be used with a consumption of MP 1.

I think that means Beatrice and her friends can use magic five or six times a day.

<blank>

In contrast, the magic I use consumes more MP.

The "Air Strike" used earlier. This is the least powerful and consumes the least amount of MP, 15.

But with that consumption it is difficult to use it in MP for people in this world.

<blank>

It can't even be used in Mia or Beatrice.

<blank>

Furthermore, the amount of my MP should probably be in the 5 digits because of the passive magic profession.

<blank>

This is definitely bottomless. ......

<blank>

I felt mildly dizzy and put my finger to my forehead.

There is a strong sense that we have come to a world with a fundamentally different set of principles.

<blank>

I have to adjust myself to the situation," he said. I know it sounds like a lot of work, but I've got to make it work!

<blank>

As long as we live in this world, we have no choice but to conform to the common sense of this world.

<blank>

Because my goal is to be an inconspicuous commoner!

I'll have to find a way to weigh myself so that I don't look as bad as possible!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, I don't want to be too late! I don't want to stay up too late, so I think I'll go make a quick round! ...And when I'm done, can I have a treat for myself? We're in an open, unpopulated place, so why not ......? Hehe!

<blank>

She starts to squirm around with her inner thighs turned inward and her cheeks a little tinted.

<blank>

I'll get it done quickly and let's get on with it! Let's just get it over with and get on with it! Yeah, let's do it! Let's do it!

<blank>

As if he couldn't wait any longer, he ran out of the house.

I'm ready to do something with Sassa.

Are they really willing to pull their own weight? I highly doubt it.



<blank>

----------------

It is highly doubtful! W!
