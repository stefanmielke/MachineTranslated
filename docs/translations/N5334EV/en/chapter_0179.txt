# 167 Episode 167 Terminal City

We disembarked from the wagon just after entering the town of Hexagom.

<blank>

I'll leave the carriage at the branch. You guys can take her and go to the hotel first!"

<blank>

Mr. Roderick looks out the window of the carriage and announces to Bibi and Mia in a louder-than-necessary voice.

<blank>

I understand! We will continue on to the hotel! Please join us as soon as possible!"

<blank>

Bibi replies in a voice that is not to be outdone.

<blank>

Even though the surroundings are noisy and noisy, I don't think it's necessary to be so loud at this distance.

A little too much appeasement, don't you think? It's getting a little too deliberate, isn't it?

Mr. Rudri, who is seated in the governor's seat, is wandering his gaze in the wrong direction with a blank expression on his face.

Is your mouth a little bit too much?

<blank>

<blank>

We saw the carriage off as it was and decided to separate from Roderick and his group for the time being.

We were to make our way to the hotel, peeking into the stores along the street.

<blank>

...... seems to be catching on!"

Yeah, two ...... so far?"

<blank>

Bibi and Mia are talking about the people who are following us.

It had been less than ten minutes since we got out of the carriage.

Well, I guess that means they stood out well on the way down.

They're too busy eating! I can't help but think that this could be just a pick-up artist or a pickpocket of some kind.

But the distance is more than 5 meters away, and I guess the right thing to do is to wait and see a little.

<blank>

I think we are walking on the main street of this town. There are so many people passing by that we cannot go straight ahead.

It is a logistics town in the eastern part of the state of Calais, and although it is not as busy as Dekenbel, there are open-air markets and stores lining both sides of the street, and I think it is reasonably bustling. ...... I don't like the atmosphere.

<blank>

I can't quite put into words what's wrong with it. ...... Would you say that it's just not getting any more vibrant?

If I had to say, everyone is more concerned about their surroundings than they should be, like ......? That kind of feeling?

<blank>

Well, if you look around the city for signs and see them, you'll naturally understand why. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Now, let's move a little here and make eye contact with Bibi.

It's not that I'm going to start running.

Just move between people and walk a little faster.

That one, the image of a parent and child, like ...... where the child suddenly found something in the crowd and started running?

What is that? or something like that?

<blank>

Never too fast, it sloshes through the crowd.

Bibi and Mia followed closely behind me.

<blank>

Yes, you are following me very closely.

Once again, I turn my attention to them and look at them to make sure they are right.

<blank>

<blank>

If I tag an opponent with my "Search" skill, I can see the degree of his strength in the image of his color.

Is this some kind of leftover game spec?

I think to myself that perhaps I am reading the etheric information of my opponent, but in fact there are other things I can identify besides strength.

<blank>

At the time of the game, PK, or player-killed characters had their names in red.

He is what is called a "red-needle.

<blank>

Even in this world, there are people who can see red.

<blank>

It doesn't mean that I really see red. I just know that it is.

Apparently, those who have taken action against an unresisting opponent can see it that way.

It seems that those who have done this repeatedly or most recently have a darker coloring.

I noticed this clearly last year when we took down a band of thieves and pirates.

They were all red-hot.

<blank>

When I came to Dekenberger, I saw such people from time to time. I guess that in a big city, there are more people, so the chances of encountering such people inevitably increase.

<blank>

I saw even more in the slum area.

When I went out to clean up for the night, there was still a rumble.

Most of the people who came out of what appeared to be a hideout were red, so it was easy to determine that they were our friends.

That fluke was red enough that I didn't feel like going easy on him.

<blank>

I don't always see this kind of thing all the time.

It would be depressing if I had to see them all over town on a regular basis!

Normally, they are adjusted so that they cannot be seen without conscious effort.

Well, it's the same way as saving physical ability.

Is it like you're squeezing it tight and reducing the sensitivity?

<blank>

I was thinking about ......, but I think I'm talking about occult-like things, like seeing and not seeing.

Are you a little girl who sees by any chance?

Well, we're in a world of magic, astral and ether, so maybe it's similar? I don't know!

<blank>

And.

They are all red. It is very easy to understand.

Is this confirmed? And I look at Bibi and Mia and nod to each other.

<blank>

We continued around the corner and entered a back street or two from the main street.

The further down the road you go, the more people disappear.

If you turn the corner there, it's going to be completely unpopular.

<blank>

Wait! You three!

<blank>

As we entered an unpopular alley, someone called out to us in a panic from behind.

I hung up! I thought it was .......

Hmm? Huh? Huh? Huh?
