# Episode 167: Terminal City

Hexagom's streets were bustling as we got off the carriage.

<b>

"We'll leave the carriage here at the branch. You all take this child and head to the hotel first!"

<b>

Mr. Roderick leaned out of the carriage window and spoke in an unnecessarily loud voice to Bibi and Mia.

<b>

"Understood! We'll head to the hotel right away! Please join us as soon as you can!"

<b>

Bibi replied back with a voice that matched his volume.

<b>

Even though the surroundings were noisy, I thought it was unnecessary to be that loud at this distance.

Isn't it a bit too much? Doesn't it feel a bit forced?

The coachman, Mr. Rudori, was pretending not to notice, his gaze wandering elsewhere.

Isn't he grinning just a bit too much?

<b>

<b>

We waved goodbye to the carriage and decided to part ways with Mr. Roderick and the others for the time being.

We were to proceed towards the hotel, peeking into the shops along the street like tourists.

<b>

"…Looks like we’ve got some followers!"

"Yeah, so far it seems like two… maybe?"

<b>

Bibi and Mia were talking about the people following us.

It had barely been ten minutes since we got off the carriage.

Well, I guess we stood out when we got off.

I can't help but think this is a bit too easy! But there’s also the possibility that they’re just pick-up artists or thieves.

However, they’re more than five meters away, so it’s probably best to observe for a bit.

<b>

I think we’re walking down the main street of this town. There are so many people that we can’t walk straight.

Given that this is a hub for logistics in the eastern part of Karais, there are stalls and shops lining both sides of the road, making it fairly lively, but… the atmosphere feels off.

<b>

I can’t quite put into words what feels off… It’s like there’s a lack of energy?

If I had to say, it seems like everyone is overly concerned about their surroundings…? That’s the feeling I get.

<b>

Well, if I look around the town and sense the atmosphere, I’ll naturally understand the reason for it…

<b>

<b>

Now, I’ll try to make a little movement, making eye contact with Bibi.

I’m not planning to start running.

I’ll just weave through the crowd, slightly increasing my walking speed.

You know, like a child suddenly spotting something in a crowd and running off… something like that?

"What's that?!" I might say.

<b>

At a pace that’s definitely not too fast, I smoothly navigate through the crowd.

Bibi and Mia are closely following behind me.

<b>

Yeah, they’re sticking right with me.

I focus on them again and confirm their presence.

<b>

<b>

Using my skill "Exploration," I can target the individuals and see their strength represented by a color.

I wonder if this is some remnant of game mechanics?

I think I’m reading their ether information, but there are actually other things I can identify besides strength.

<b>

In the game, characters who had committed player kills (PK) had their names displayed in red.

These were the so-called "red names."

<b>

In this world, there are also people who appear red.

<b>

It’s not that I see them as literally red. I just know that they are.

It seems that those who have acted against defenseless individuals appear this way.

The more they repeat their actions or the more recent their actions, the darker the color seems to be.

I first clearly noticed this when I took down a bandit group or pirates last year.

Every single one of them was bright red.

<b>

When I came to Dekkenbel, I also spotted a few of that kind. I guess in a big city like this, the chances of encountering such individuals naturally increase.

<b>

I saw even more of them in the slums.

When I went out for nighttime cleaning, they were definitely around.

Most of the people who came out from what seemed to be their hideouts were red, making it easy to identify them as allies.

That Fluke was also sufficiently red, so I had no intention of holding back.

<b>

I don’t always see this.

If I were constantly looking for them in the streets, it would be quite bothersome!

I usually adjust my perception so that I don’t see them unless I focus.

It’s similar to how I save my physical abilities.

It feels like I’m tightening and suppressing my sensitivity.

<b>

…Now that I think about it, saying I can see or can’t see feels a bit occult-like, doesn’t it?

Am I perhaps a "child who can see"?!

Well, since I’m in a world with magic, astral beings, and ether, it might be something similar? I’m not really sure!

<b>

So then.

The ones following us are all undoubtedly red. Yes, it’s very clear.

I can consider this confirmed, and I exchange glances with Bibi and Mia, nodding in agreement.

<b>

We then turned the corner and entered one or two back streets away from the main road.

As we moved deeper into the alley, the number of people dwindled.

If we turn the corner there, it seems like it will be completely deserted.

<b>

"Stop! You three there!"

<b>

Just as we entered the deserted alley, someone called out to us in a flustered manner from behind.

Gotcha! I thought, but… 

Huh? What? What’s going on?
