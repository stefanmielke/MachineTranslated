# 107 After the Fight

A few additions.

After the dueling uproar, stormy days followed.

For some reason, right after that, I was surrounded by strangers, accosted, talked to, invited to tea parties, and so on. It made my eyeballs go round and round!

In general, why do they come to me?

You dueled with Irving! Why don't you just go to Irving?

<blank>

Well, Irving was surrounded, too!

But that was Bibi taming it, you know!

I'd like to say, "I'd like to do something about the people who came to see me, too! I'd like to say!

Well, that's okay!

I know Irving is more important to you!

Female friendships are just like that. It's nothing short of sad! It's a sad story!

<blank>

I guess he was saying, "You're supposed to take care of this stuff yourself. That's the way he looked at me, Bibi. Besides, Irving was swallowed by a huge wave of people. ...... I know!

But it was seriously hard work!

After all, I didn't turn down Carrie-sama's invitation to a tea party, and there was no way I could refuse! Sic sic sic sic sic .......

Although the invitation this time was not on the same day as the last time, I was really scared because I could see Carrie behind the smiling face of the lady who brought the invitation card, and she had a very strong atmosphere!

<blank>

Carrie's tea party was like the one I had feared when she first invited me, surrounded by her sisters.

Oh, no! I was really surrounded!

<blank>

Those sisters ...... and the three seniors who are Carrie's cronies.

One was a senior named Josie McCoy, with auburn hair in a medium bob.

She's a sprightly, lively, big sister, I guess you'd call her, and she's the one who brings the three of us together.

<blank>

The other is Valerie Brown, a senior with healthy brown skin and shiny black hair.

He is probably the most sensible person here. He sometimes admonished Carrie for her excessive behavior. Carrie does not mind that. They must have a good relationship.

<blank>

And the last sister is a senior named Melody Valentine with blond hair and blue eyes.

She has a soft blonde hair and a lovely face, she looks like a doll, but ......, she has a strange sense of distance! The moment I met her, she hugged me and kissed me on my cheek! From the reactions of other senior members, she seems to be a natural wonder girl! After Carrie, she is the second most dangerous sister!

<blank>

The tea party was held in the school's botanical garden, where we sat on benches in the garden's pavilion, surrounded and sandwiched by the older ladies who held us tight and said, "This way this time, this way next! Come back quickly! My eyeballs were also turned in a circle, and I was in a lot of trouble!

<blank>

Furthermore, Carrie-sama, while having tea, looked at me, who was held firmly by her sisters, from the front, and said something frightening in a truly joyful manner.

<blank>

Your knightly fighting was truly amazing. Irving Haggard's skills must have been well-known throughout the school during the duel the day before yesterday.

"...... is, ha, ah, thank you, thank you?"

Another one, I believe, from the Brooke family: ......."

"This is Mr. Lombard Braque, Mr. Carey."

Thanks Valerie. I wonder if he, Lombard Burok, is as good as Irving Haggard? Sue.

Yes, that's right. We always have a good fight.

'Hmmm...quintessential. As Dana and Colin said, ......, no, it's more than that."

Huh? Huh. ......"

And Beatrice Croquis, who has high magical powers, aptitude in all five attributes, and has been the top student in the entrance examinations of the last decade, has been called 'the one brilliant girl in 20 years'.

Mia Mathieson, who has demonstrated a high aptitude for all four attributes and the greatest magical power in the school's history."

Suzy Cloud, the next head of AMCAM, is the one who unites and follows them. "Suzy Cloud, the next head of AMCAM, who will lead them all. You've only been here half a month, and already your position in the school is unassailable.

Huh? Heh? Heh heh heh heh?

<blank>

What the fuck? What is it? What's that standing there? What is it? What do you mean, "something unshakable"? We don't need that!

Master Carrie's smile was really scary too, and I was really about to cry, you know?

<blank>

If Colin and Jessica hadn't come to pick me up, I would have been taken home by Carrie! No, seriously!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After surviving such a raging day, we decided to visit Uncle Philip's mansion for the weekend, as we had promised to do.

Your uncle's mansion is also the consulate of Amkam.

So this time, all of us who came out from AMCAM also paid a visit to greet my uncle, the consul general.

<blank>

So I asked him to take a day off from his work in the "big front yard" today.

Selkie and Merle both said they were also closed today, so Karen would be the only one going to the store.

That worries me very much.

<blank>

<blank>

In case you are wondering, Merle gave me a shortcut to get to the store the other day.

This is like running down from the high plateau where the school is located. It is a short cut without using a carriage, and you can go down to the town below, but it is also a very hard route.

Merle said, "Don't tell the other girls, but ......," but I don't think this route can be used so easily even if I told them. I don't think it is a road that a "daughter with a deep window" should use, although it is not a very good road. The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get to the top of the mountain is to be able to see the road and not to go through the middle of the mountain.

I thought it was great that Mr. Selkie was running down such a route with me, saying in a dumbfounded manner, "Merle is a total .......

<blank>

Of course, our group could follow them without any difficulty. Compared to running through the Amkamu forest, it's not particularly dangerous. I didn't miss Merle's eyes widening when he saw us following him without a care in the world.

But what made my eyes widen even more was when I saw Karen following him without a care in the world. Yes, this surprised me too.

I had heard that he liked to run, but I had not expected him to enjoy following me on a route with steep downhill slopes and obstacles so happily and without lagging behind everyone else.

I think Merle was watching us at first, and he was holding back his speed, but then he really started to get serious. When we arrived at the store, he was a little out of breath.

<blank>

Still, I was amazed at Karen's physical ability. She is definitely better than Bibi and Mia. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were both pretty out of breath, but Karen seemed to be fine. Merle, looking at Karen, let out a mumble that sounded like, "Are you a ...... Bakemon?" Suzy Year had caught Merle's mutter of "Are you a  Bakemon?

But really, is she going to go on to a magic career? Even though she has an aptitude for two attributes, I think it's a shame to go the other way.

For the most part, even those Dana and Irvin now have two attributes!

Yes, I should invite him to run and train at our house next time.

<blank>

Well, that's how it is, so I'm not too worried about Karen going to the store by herself.

So what I'm worried about is ......, what happens after her work is done. I'm worried about what happens after it's over!

<blank>

That was after work last week.

Karen said that she would not return to the dormitory that day, but would continue on to the facility where her younger siblings were staying, where she would have a sleepover and the three of them would spend the night together tonight.

I was relieved to hear her say that she had permission to stay out overnight for this purpose, but at the same time, I felt a certain uneasiness.

What can I say, ......, the light-hearted atmosphere she exudes makes me very, very uneasy about letting her walk alone in the city at night. I mean, is she overprotective? I guess you could say that I am overprotective of her!

Karen, can you go by yourself? Is she going to be okay? I asked her if she was okay going by herself, and she replied, "No problem. She answered, "No problem.

But...! I was really worried, so I decided to follow him to the facility and drop him off.

Merle said, "You're overprotective! You're a mother!" but so what? I'm going! Mr. selkie, please close that cat later.

<blank>

And I was surprised! The facility in question was built in a pretty amazing place.

It was at the edge of the downtown area, but two streets away, the downtown area is lined with buildings where the callers' older brothers and sisters attract customers and swallow them up.

Moreover, from the standpoint of public morals, they are all stores that are not suitable for children.

Even though the sun is just beginning to set, several stores are already open for business and people are coming and going.

When I asked Karen if the facility was safe in such a location, she replied with something out of focus. Karen replied with something out of focus, "During the daytime, there are hardly any people around, and it's quiet most of the time.

<blank>

This is not good. My intuition was right. It was not a good idea to let Karen walk alone in such a place and at such a time of day!

If you let Karen, who has such a thin-skinned constitution, walk around in a place like this, she could get into a hell of a lot of trouble sooner or later!

<blank>

Should we have a lookout or guard ......, I'll talk to AnnaMary about it when we get back to the dorm. I will also talk to my uncle about this and ask him if he has any good ideas.

It's the town of DeKembel, and your uncle might be able to give you some good advice.

<blank>

I decided to lend Karen my hood, which has a recognition blocker attached to it.

This is what I had my children wear when I would take them into the woods with my children in Amkam, when I would not let them participate in the hunt, but would take them to lower levels to gain experience.

It is not a powerful grant, but it is effective enough for demonic beasts with a threat value of 2 to 3 that are in the shallow layers of the forest.

Well, since it is such a product, there is no problem at all if you are dealing with street thugs with a threat value of 0.2 or even less.

<blank>

Wear this and move around so you don't pass any suspicious places. I gave it to Karen.

<blank>

At first, Karen tried to refrain from wearing it, saying, "I can't afford such an expensive piece of equipment! But I was so worried that if she didn't wear it, I couldn't do anything about it! I can't help it if you don't wear it!

<blank>

So, although it was a bit forced, I am relieved that he managed to wear this.

<blank>

But I still think they should put up a guard or something at some point. ...... In general, it's a big problem because there are drunks sleeping on the street where that facility is located, too! Why would they build a facility in a place like that?

...... No, why don't we just clean up that whole area? We should disinfect the filth, right?

<blank>

He was mumbling and mumbling and mumbling.

Bibi, who had heard what was going on, came up to me with a serious look on his face and said, "This is going to be really embarrassing! He came at me with a serious look on his face.

No, I don't do anything too big. But he would reply, "You don't know the difference between right and wrong! but he replies, "You don't know the difference between what is right and what is wrong!

Oh, no! I'm growing up too! I can adjust my body temperature normally! If I appealed to him, he would say. "Your normal is far from normal! I was told, "Your normal is far from normal!

What? That's not true, is it? Right? When I asked them, they all nodded their heads and said, "Bibi is right, hands down.

<blank>

Hey, hey! Everyone is being kind of awful!
