# Chapter 107: After the Battle

I made a few additions.

----------------

<b>

After the duel commotion, stormy days came rushing in.

For some reason, right after that, I was surrounded by strangers, being spoken to and invited to tea parties left and right. Thanks to that, my head was spinning!

Why do they come to me anyway?

It was Irvin who had the duel! Shouldn't they go to Irvin instead?!

<b>

Well, Irvin was surrounded too!

But it was Bibi who was handling it!

If anything, I want to say to those who were coming to me, "Why don't you go to him instead?!"

Well, it's fine!

I know that for you, Irvin is more important!

Friendship among women is ultimately just like that. It's really sad! Hmph, sniff sniff, meow meow!!

<b>

It's probably a message of "Handle this yourself." Bibi was looking at me with that kind of gaze. Plus, Irvin was being overwhelmed by a massive wave of people... I get it!

But it was seriously tough!

In the end, I couldn't refuse the invitation to the tea party from Lady Carrie, nor could I have! Sniff sniff...

This time, the invitation wasn't like last time where it was on the same day, but the atmosphere of the smiling maid who brought the invitation left no room for refusal, and I could clearly see Lady Carrie behind her, which was really scary!

<b>

Lady Carrie's tea party was just as I had feared during the initial invitation, surrounded by older ladies.

No! I was really surrounded!

<b>

Those older ladies... were the three senior ladies who were Lady Carrie's entourage.

One of them was a senior named Josie McCoy, with medium bob red-brown hair.

She was a lively older sister, you could say she had a big sister vibe? She felt like the one who brought the three together.

<b>

Another one was a senior named Valerie Brown, with beautiful healthy brown skin and glossy black hair.

She was probably the most sensible among them. She occasionally admonished Lady Carrie's excessive behavior. Lady Carrie didn't seem to dislike it. They probably have a good relationship.

<b>

And the last older sister was a senior named Melody Valentine, with blonde hair and blue eyes.

With soft blonde hair and a lovely face, she looked like a doll... but this person had a strange sense of distance! The moment we met, she hugged me and planted a big kiss on my cheek!! Judging by the reactions of the other seniors, she seemed to have a natural quirky character! She's the second most dangerous lady after Lady Carrie!!

<b>

The tea party held in the school's botanical garden took place while sitting on benches set up in the garden's gazebo, but there I was firmly held and surrounded by the older ladies, being spun around with phrases like "Now this way," "Next this way!" and "Come back quickly!" My eyes were spinning, and it was a real ordeal!!

<b>

Furthermore, while sipping tea, Lady Carrie looked directly at me, who was firmly held by the older ladies, and said something truly terrifying with a cheerful expression.

<b>

"Your knight's fighting style was truly wonderful. The prowess of Irvin Haggard must have spread throughout the academy after the duel the day before yesterday."

"Uh, th-thank you very much?"

"And another, if I recall correctly, from the Blough family..."

"That's Lombard Blough, Lady Carrie."

"Thank you, Valerie. Does that Lombard Blough also possess strength equal to Irvin Haggard? Su?"

"Y-yes, he always puts up a good fight during matches."

"Hehe, as expected. Just as Dana and Colin said... no, even more than that."

"Huh? Uh..."

"And with high magical power and aptitude for all five attributes, Beatrice Croki, who has achieved the top score in the entrance exams over the past decade, is called 'a genius once every twenty years.'"

"Mia Mattison, who demonstrated high aptitude for four attributes and the highest magical power in the academy's history."

"And finally, Suzy Cloud, the next head of Amkam, who gathers and leads them all. Hehe, well done, Su? Despite having only been here for half a month, your standing in the academy has already become unshakeable."

"Eh? Huh?? Huhhhh?!"

<b>

What is this? What is this standing?! What does unshakeable mean?!

I don't need something like that!!

Lady Carrie's smile was really scary, and I was about to cry?!

If Colin and Jessica hadn't come to pick me up, I would have surely been truly "taken home" by Lady Carrie! No, seriously!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

Having endured such tumultuous days, the weekend arrived, and as promised, I was to visit Uncle Philip's mansion.

Uncle's mansion also serves as the consulate for Amkam.

So this time, everyone who came from Amkam was visiting to greet Uncle, who is the consul.

<b>

Therefore, today I took a break from work in the "large front yard."

Both Selkie and Meruru said they were taking the day off, so it would just be Karen going to the shop alone.

That worried me a lot.

<b>

<b>

By the way, recently, Meruru taught me a shortcut to get to the shop.

It's like rushing down from the hill where the academy is located, allowing us to reach the lower town without using a carriage, but it's quite a hard route.

Meruru said, "It's a secret from the other kids..." but even if she told me, I don't think this route can be used so easily. It's definitely not a path suitable for a "delicate young lady." No, I felt like we passed through places that weren't even roads at some points... Is it a shortcut only someone with high physical abilities like Meruru could use?

While I was thinking that, Selkie, who was running down with me, also seemed quite amazing, saying, "Seriously, Meruru..."

<b>

Of course, our group could easily keep up. Compared to running through the Amkam forest, it wasn't particularly dangerous. I noticed Meruru lightly widening her eyes when she saw us keeping up without any issues.

But even more surprising was when she saw Karen keeping up effortlessly. Yeah, I was surprised too.

I had heard she liked running, but I never expected her to enjoy such a steep downhill and obstacle-filled route without falling behind everyone.

I think Meruru was initially holding back her speed while watching us, but she definitely got serious partway through. By the time we reached the shop, she was slightly out of breath.

<b>

Still, I was amazed by Karen's high physical abilities. She's definitely better than Bibi and Mia, right? By the time we arrived at the shop, both of them were quite out of breath, but Karen had a perfectly fine expression. I caught Meruru muttering, "Is she a monster?" while looking at Karen!

But is this girl really planning to pursue a magical profession? Even though she has aptitude for two attributes, it feels like such a waste.

After all, even Dana and Irvin now have two attributes!

Yeah, I think I should invite her to join our running and training sessions next time.

<b>

Well, with that said, I'm not too worried about Karen going to the shop alone.

So what am I worried about...? It's about what happens after her work. I'm worried about after it ends!

<b>

That was after last week's work ended.

On this day, Karen didn't return to the dormitory but said she was going to the facility where her siblings were and would spend the night together with them.

She said she had obtained permission for an overnight stay, and I was somewhat relieved to hear her talk about it so happily, but at the same time, I felt an inexplicable anxiety.

How should I put it... The faintly unfortunate aura she exuded made me very uneasy about her walking alone in the night streets. Yes, if someone calls it overprotective, that's true!

When I asked Karen if she could go alone, she replied that it was fine, no problem.

But! I was extremely worried, so I decided to accompany her to the facility.

Meruru pointed at me and said, "You're overprotective!" "You're like a mother!" but so what! I'm going!

Selkie, please take care of that cat later.

<b>

And then, I was surprised! The facility in question was built in quite an impressive location.

It was at the edge of the entertainment district, but just two streets over, there were buildings packed with people trying to attract customers.

Moreover, the shops there were not suitable for children to see.

Even though the sun had just begun to set, several shops had already started business, with people coming in and out.

When I asked Karen if it was okay for a facility to be in such a location, she replied, "During the day, there are hardly any people, and it's usually quiet," giving me a somewhat off-target answer.

<b>

This is not good. My instincts were not wrong. I can't let Karen walk alone in a place like this at this time!

If I let someone with such an unfortunate disposition as Karen walk around here, she might get caught up in some terrible trouble!!

<b>

Should I assign a guard or something...? I'll consult Anna Mary when I return to the dorm. I should also discuss this with Uncle to see if he has any good ideas.

Since it's about the city of Deckenberg, I might get some good advice from Uncle.

<b>

For now, I decided to lend Karen a hood that grants recognition inhibition.

This is something I had the children wear when entering the forest in Amkam, to let the lower-tier children gain experience without participating in the hunt.

It's not a powerful enchantment, but it works well against magical beasts with a threat level of 2-3 that dwell in the shallow layers of the forest.

Well, since it's such an item, it would have no problem against thugs in the city with a threat level of less than 0.2.

<b>

I handed it to Karen, telling her to wear it and avoid suspicious places.

<b>

At first, Karen was trying to politely refuse, saying, "Such an expensive enchanted item is too much!" but I half-forced it on her, saying, "If you don't wear it, I'll be so worried I won't know what to do!"

<b>

So, even though it was a bit forceful, I managed to get her to wear it, which was a relief.

<b>

But still, I think I should eventually assign a guard or something... After all, on the road where that facility is located, there are even drunks sleeping without a care, which is a big problem! Why would they build a facility in such a place?!

...No, maybe I should just clean up that whole area? It's best to disinfect filth!

<b>

I seemed to have muttered such things aloud.

Bibi, who overheard me, approached with a serious expression and said, "If you really do that, it will become a serious matter, so stop!"

No, I wouldn't do anything that extreme. But she replied, "You don't know how to hold back!"

What?! I'm definitely growing! I can hold back normally! When I protested, she said, "Your normal is far from what is generally considered normal!"

Huh? That's not true, right? Right? When I asked everyone, they all nodded in agreement, saying, "Bibi is overwhelmingly correct."

<b>

Hey now! Everyone is being so harsh!!
