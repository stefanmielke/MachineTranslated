# 102 The Little Animal Incident

Whew, that was a moderately tense meeting."

Oh, yeah? I had a good time."

You're a rock, Carrie."

<blank>

When I say this, she starts giggling, as if she is really enjoying herself.

<blank>

I wish I could have held her at least once. I wish I could have held her in my arms at least once."

I'm proud of you for putting up with it.

I know, right? Really, I've already put up with that so, so, so much!"

<blank>

She stresses how patient and strong-willed she was.

So much so that she would like to say that it took a great deal of willpower to resist the temptation.

What in the world are you trying to force ...... to do?

<blank>

She is indeed a beautiful girl.

Her face is so beautifully arranged that you would think she was a doll, and her hair shimmers like rubies when the light hits it. Just by being there, she has something that catches people's eyes and keeps them there.

Many times I have seen students, both girls and boys, who have seen her talk about her excitedly.

No wonder the students were excited when they actually saw it up close.

However, the cobalt green eyes made me feel as if I were sinking into a deep sea, and I was a little creeped out.

<blank>

'I appreciate the advice I got from Colin, Carla and the others. Eddie, how was she from your perspective?"

I have been trying to be as invisible as possible when I am looking after the young lady, but she has always been able to catch me. I was just amazed at how good the Princess of Amkamu is, Ed Hamilton.

"You let Eddie tell you that much: ......"

<blank>

Eddie is a professional butler at the salon, and at the same time, he is in charge of escorting students who use the salon.

The class is called "Brainwalker," a specialized senior position.

She is also a practical skills instructor in the upper division, and her ability to make such comments is evident.

<blank>

"...... even though he's so adorable and rolls around with just a little poke and he's so adorable ......"

<blank>

Carrie put her hand on her cheek and murmured as if thinking back.

Your eyes are a little moist and your cheeks have a slight blush. ......

As far as I'm concerned, she doesn't say anything when she looks like this, as if she's fascinated by something.

<blank>

If I were to thrust my blade at him, he would devour him in an instant. ...... the true manifestation of Amukam itself. I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not! I'm thrilled!"

So stop saying horrible things, Carrie. It's our duty to make sure that doesn't happen."

Oh? I know, Anthony. I've told you a thousand times. I'm just saying she's a nice girl, okay?"

<blank>

Once again, she said that she had a sense of moderation. She said something like, "I have a sense of moderation.

So that's the kind of tokoro I'm talking about. ...... Please really give me a break, Carrie.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The next head of AMCAM will enter the academy.

This caused more than a few ripples within the school.

<blank>

Few people in the state of Calais, where we live, know the name AMCAM and its brand.

Amkam is a producer of high quality products derived from magical beasts.

This is the home town of specialists who use their experience in dealing with magical beasts to undertake exterminations of magical beasts in various locations.

That's probably how most people perceive AMCAM.

<blank>

Not many, however, understand its true nature.

It is not a place that a half-hearted person should meddle in. If it is brought to their attention, even the country could be tipped over the edge.

The true nature of amcam is not something that should be made public. Only those who should know should understand.

We have been successfully balancing that relationship, that balance, in this city so far.

We will have to build that relationship successfully with her as well from now on.

<blank>

<blank>

In the future, those who are only interested in Amkam's good taste will try to get to her somehow.

However, it is not at all desirable to be stirred up by such half-wits and cause her and AMCAM discomfort.

We must not let that happen, and we have no intention of letting it happen.

<blank>

Does she realize that this tea party was, in effect, the top meeting in this school? No, according to Colin, that girl is not of the quality to be concerned about that side of things.

Well, that's good.

All that matters is the fact that the three of us were meeting. That's all that matters now, as long as everyone knows that.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I was eventually released from the lounge more than 30 minutes after the chairman arrived.

I had to move my shift at ...... i.e. my part-time job at the tea house by an hour because I had an appointment, so I had to leave the school now to make it in time. I told them to let me go.

After all, it's a matter of good name for the school to back out of a whole job!

Cali...... Caroline finally gave up and came to the entrance of the lounge to send me off.

<blank>

You can use this lounge whenever you want. Let's talk more leisurely next time, okay?"

Yes, yes, you're right. ......

'Oh, yes! Now that girl ......, yes! Come with Miss Cordilia Casper. You two are close, aren't you?"

Uh, let's see... ......."

<blank>

Colin said the tea party was just a "meet-and-greet," but even so, it seemed like a very intense and exhausting time.

Colin is right, I know that Lady Caroline has a good personality, but I can smell the same odor from this person as I do from Carla and the others: ....... I have a feeling that if we are not careful, she could really take us home with her! I can feel it!

<blank>

It was a very good time, and I look forward to working with you again in the future. I look forward to working with you in the future."

It's nice to meet you, too.

<blank>

Mr. Leinberger told me a little bit about the student council, and it seems like they are having a lot of trouble.

<blank>

'No, Victor sums it up well. ...... does a good job of summarizing."

<blank>

The story of the hardship was somewhat softly told, but well, when the main cause of the hardship is due to those of Amcam, I feel responsible for it. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Victor Frank is in the same grade as Carla and her friends, two years older than us, the older brother of Mary and Shelley, and the mysterious Object X!

<blank>

That was the day I entered the dormitory, after the "Scourge of the Rose Garden" happened ...... It's not actually a "scourge", but ...... it's not there!

When everyone was heading to the main dining hall for dinner, it came.

As usual, there was no sound or sign of life, and no one noticed that we were closing in on them.

<blank>

However! Myashi!

I, too, will not remain the same forever!

I thrust out my elbow on the line of movement of the absent-minded person who is creeping up behind me.

The elbow, thrust out with exquisite timing, caught him in the water moon and sent him flying backward with a sound that could not have come from a human being! and a sound that could not have been made by a human being erupted from his mouth, and he flew backward as it was!

<blank>

YES!

<blank>

Hmmm! It's not going to be like the old days anymore! I can easily catch even an unwitting opponent now!

For me, Victor's fear is no longer enough to be feared! I am no longer the young man I was when I was a child. ......

I'm really impressed with how far you've come, baby......! Now, I'm going to escort you gently from here on out, baby.

<blank>

I froze with my eyes wide open.

Victor, who had supposedly flown backwards, was there. He is at my feet! Between my legs! Lying on my back, looking up, I see him!

<blank>

Do, do, do, do...where are you looking?

He was talking to me in a friendly way, and he was moving his fingers up and down my legs with exquisite force!



A powerful gush of air erupted from the back of my throat, and a cry from my soul echoed throughout the area.

At the same time, the face of the pervert on the floor is smashed! and stomp down on the face of the pervert on the floor at the same time! I heard the sound of something being crushed, but I didn't care, I just kept on stomping! I heard a sound like something was crushed, but I kept on stepping on it regardless!

<blank>

This black thing won't die with this! You can't kill it with this!

Immediately recognizing my voice, Kara, Jessica, Alicia, and Dana flew in and together we stomped the G-class pests!

Hiiii! It moved! Is he alive? Huh! How fast?

No, don't miss! No, you can't miss it! I'm sure it will grow back! It will grow back!

..! ・・・・・・! ・・・・・・・・・！！！！

<blank>

<blank>

And so, my reunion with Victor was fearless and noisy. ......

<blank>

But can you believe that she is the second most popular girl in the school after the student body president and the vice president of the student council?

Surprise, right? I can't believe the nerve of these senior girls for a minute!

Surely everyone must be fooled! I bet they are! They're just good looking like that! Only in appearance!

<blank>

Alphonse's toco, Arrows, who greeted me afterwards, was still a normal guy and very gentlemanly!

I really admire him for being so normal! I think that gentleman Arrows is much more popular than object X Victor! I am!

<blank>

However, perhaps thanks to the popularity of the girls, they are able to mediate problems between students (especially between female students!). They are able to mediate problems between students (especially between female students!).

Mr. Rheinberger, the student body president, said so.

<blank>

But more than that, it is also Victor who brings trouble to the student body. ......

Yeah, sorry. I'm really sorry, Amcam's guy!

<blank>

So, I feel guilty for Mr. Rheinberger and shudder for Mr. Goldberg!

This tense tea party, which I did not understand at all, came to an end.

<blank>

I'm tired, really. ......

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

And since I couldn't get to work on time, I asked Karen to go ahead of me.

Of course, I am not alone. Mr. Merle and Mr. Selkie are with me.

I was a little worried because I haven't been able to talk to Karen properly after this morning's mess, but I've asked Mr. Selkie to take care of her, so she'll probably be fine. And it's not just Mr. Selkie and the others at work, there are senior staff as well!

A proper talk would probably be better done in your dorm room after you return and settle down.

I don't think it's something to talk about in a hurry.

<blank>

Karen and the others would go ahead of me, but Bibi and Mia said they would wait for me.

I would like to rise in the ranks of the union together," said Bibi! says Bibi.

Vivi is a good girl with a good heart for her friends, really!

<blank>

I met them at the main gate, but since we were running a little behind schedule, I proceeded a little faster down the forest road.

And for some reason, there is a sign of Bibi and the others in the middle of the forest road. And it is not only Bibi and Mia.

...... Is this Miss Cordelia?

Why are Bibi and Miss Cordelia confronting each other here?

<blank>

As I got closer, I saw Mia standing there with Bibi by her side, looking indescribably dumbfounded.

The two attendants of the other woman, Miss Cordelia, looked flustered and flustered.

<blank>

<blank>

I hope you don't think you're the only one who has a follower from Novice!"

<blank>

Miss Cordilia said something.



What is it? Are we going to start some kind of performance?

<blank>

Oh, yes!

<blank>

Bibi, on the other hand, is uninterested and salty!

At his shoulder, Algernon is twitching his nose in a kikikyu, and unlike his master, he seems to be interested in something.

<blank>

"Behold! Look at my follower! He is but a child, but he will grow up to be a divine beast, and he will be fierce!

<blank>

Oh, no! Miss Cordelia is getting excited!

Oh, two of your attendants noticed Koch.

<blank>

'No, no, no, Master Cloud! Cordelia-sama is a little out of herself, and she is a little ...... out of her voice! A little bit! You know what? You see!

<blank>

He kind of looks like he's going to cling to me, doesn't he? The other taller girl is also a little pale, but she is shaking her head with great vigor to match her partner. Is it my imagination that somehow both of these girls are in a completely different mood than they were in the morning?

I remember that on my first day at the school, I seemed to be moving quite briskly as Miss Cordelia's attendant. ......

I get a very different impression from the two of them now than I did then.

<blank>

Oh, if you don't look well, I don't think you should push yourself too hard. If you don't feel well, I think you should get some rest as soon as possible, okay?

Oh, I remember that one of the herbs that Mama Sonia gave me was supposed to improve blood circulation and help me get a healthy sleep. I'll ask AnnaMarie to bring it later.

<blank>

Come on out! Sturgeon!!!!"

<blank>

Miss Cordilia's voice was high pitched as she kept her right hand pointed at Bibi.

Then, as if in response to her voice, a white shadow moves quickly at her feet.

It ran up her body and came to the end of her right hand, which was held out toward Bibi, where it stood proudly against her chest.

<blank>

Hmm? Is this a white kitten?

No, the body is thin, long! Round ears, tiny face!

There it is! That's Okojo! It's a little ocotillo!

It's about 10 centimeters long, including the tail, which is not even half of Algernon, who is 30 centimeters long!

They are squeaking and twitching their noses!

Wow, isn't it so small that it fits in your palm?

Oh, man! This guy is cute! He's so cute!

<blank>

Come on! Scrape your eyes! This cub is my follower of the divine beast Bran Renard! If he continues to grow, he will become one of the divine beasts! The founder of the Casper family was a renowned master tamer of divine beasts! I, too, will become a legendary "Fantastica Tamer" along with this cub! Now! You are witnessing the first steps of that legend!

<blank>

Miss Cordelia seems to be saying something in a high voice, but my attention is glued to the small white animal on her hand!

<blank>

What is this guy?

Their dull black eyes clicked!

He stands on his hind legs and sticks out his front paws and squeaks!

This little guy is too cute! Oh, my God!

<blank>

Yeah?

Sturgeon?

<blank>

While I was writhing in agony at the cuteness, Algernon and his ocotillo suddenly jumped off the shoulders and hands of the two masters and started running.

The two animals quickly reach and face the exact midpoint of the two girls facing each other.

Bibi and Miss Cordelia were startled by the sudden movement of the two animals, but the small animals did not seem to be bothered by their master's surprise, and began to communicate with each other in a kikikyu-kikyu, pikikyu-kikyu fashion.

<blank>

Algernon stands on his hind legs and looks down at Okojo.

In a normal natural world, I think rats would be in the position of being preyed upon by ocojos. ...... What's the big deal about Algernon against someone who is only half as big as he is? Kiki-kikikyuu! and he makes a gesture like turning his chest away from his body.

Okojo, on the other hand, bowed his head in a pique-like gesture!

Fluffy! What's soooo cute now?

<blank>

"...... fu"

Sturgeon?

<blank>

What is it? Have you created a hierarchical relationship among small animals? Is it a fantasy that a rat would be on top of an okoujou, even though the latter is bigger than the former?

The reactions of the two masters who were watching this situation are also truly contrasting.

If she's scared, she's snickering as if to say she's won, and Miss Cordilia looks like she's about to cry, which doesn't suit her bullheadedness.

<blank>

Well, is it a world of squires? You mean the world of the demons, the relationships, the customs, the way things are done? I don't really know! I wonder if they are discussing such things.

Frequently, Algernon seems to be giving Okojo some kind of guidance.

But isn't Algernon a bit too much of a mount just because he's so small? It seems to me that you are talking like a big man!

<blank>

Huh? Huh? Algernon? What are you talking about? What are you doing? Hey, hey, hey! You're ......!

'Nah nah nah, what? Sturgeon? Sturgeon?

<blank>

Hmm? What is it? The two masters are starting to act strangely. What's up?

The two small animals turned their noses toward me and came running toward me in a straight line.

Oh? Algernon, are you trying to bring that little guy to my place? Oh, well! You're so clever!

Come on, jump into your sister's chest! I'll give you a big smooch!

<blank>

Without looking aside, they came straight at me, kicked the ground and jumped up in front of me, and flew to my chest in a parabola.

Wooooooooooooo! Fluffy on the chest ～～～～.......

However! It was only for a brief moment that I could feel such a mofo.

<blank>

Nyah? Meow! Nyaa! Nyaaahhh! Ah? Aah! A-nyaaaahhhhh!

<blank>

As soon as they reached my chest, these little animals had the audacity to slip through the cracks of my shirt and into the inside of it in an instant!

Blah, blah, blah! Algernon! Wait a minute! What's that? Sleigh!

<blank>

Nya! Nyah! Hyah!

<blank>

They do the most extraordinary things! They continue to move exquisitely around in the secret places of the maidens inside their shirts.

I could do nothing but toss and turn, thrashing about, my back shattered, and screaming in a strange way.

<blank>

Finally, I ran out of strength and sat up, breathing hard and putting my hands on the ground.

Then, two white shadows leapt out of the gap in my shirt as I looked down. The recoil of the shadows made my body move even more jerkily.

<blank>

 Kickkickkickkick! He was standing in front of me with his chest outstretched like a big man.

The little one standing in front of him, Okojo, is also purring! or so he replied with a plaintive squeal!

<blank>

......I kind of understand the conversation you just had!

This is the point to please Miss! You get it? You said something like that, didn't you? Algernon!

So, we know who Okojo is! Master..! And you answered like that, didn't you? Yeah? Hey!

<blank>

"Ah, ah, ah! Algernon! What are you ...... doing? Antaaaah!"

"Susu susu Sturgeon? Sturgeon! What, what, what ...... what?!!!!"

<blank>

At the same time that the cries of the two masters echoed around the area, the white furballs ran from the scene and disappeared!

It was as if it was a pewter, and it ran away and vanished in a spectacular manner!

<blank>

Oh, you know what, Sue? Here this, this is the thing! That's the thing!

"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"

<blank>

Bibi approaching fearfully and Miss Cordelia's voice ...... apologizing and shouting as she moves away.

However, there was no way I could afford to react to them.

He could only pull and shake his body in a small way, with his soul slightly peeking out of his mouth!

What a humiliation!

Oh, oh! Oh! Oh, you little animals!
