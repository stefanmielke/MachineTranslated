# Episode 102: The Small Animal Incident

"Ah, that was quite a tense meeting."

"Oh really? I had fun."

"You really are something, Carrie."

<b>

Saying that, she starts to giggle with genuine delight.

<b>

"Because she was really such a cute girl, right? I wanted to hold her at least once."

"You did well to hold back."

"Right?! I really, really held back!"

<b>

She passionately emphasizes how patient and resolute she was.

It seems she wants to convey just how much willpower was required to resist that temptation.

What on earth is she going on about...?

<b>

Indeed, that girl is a beautiful young lady.

Her face is so perfectly shaped that one might think she's a doll, and when the light hits her hair, it sparkles like rubies. Just by being there, she possesses something that captivates people's eyes.

I've seen students who have seen her, both girls and boys, excitedly talking about her numerous times.

Seeing her up close, I can understand the students' excitement.

However, her cobalt green eyes seem to draw me in like a deep ocean, sending a slight shiver down my spine.

<b>

"I'm grateful for the advice from Colin and Carla. Eddie, what did you think of her from your perspective?"

"Yes, when I was attending to my lady, I tried to remain as inconspicuous as possible, but she was always aware of my presence. I, Ed Hamilton, can only be in awe of how the princess of Amkam is like this."

"She can make Eddie say that..."

<b>

Eddie is not only the specialized butler of this salon but also has the duty of protecting the students who use the salon.

That class is known as the specialized advanced job called "Brainwalker."

With him also serving as an instructor for practical classes in the upper-level subjects, her capabilities are evident in how far she can push him to say such things.

<b>

"She’s so adorable, yet with just a little poke, she rolls over, so very cute..."

<b>

Carrie rests her hand on her cheek, murmuring as if reminiscing.

Her eyes are slightly moist, and her cheeks are tinged with a hint of red...

When she has that look of being captivated by something, she tends not to say anything sensible.

<b>

"Even though she's such a soft girl... if I were to thrust a drawn blade at her just once, she would instantly tear my body apart, wouldn’t she? ... Truly the embodiment of Amkam. Ah! It gives me chills!"

"Please stop saying such terrifying things, Carrie. It’s our duty to ensure that doesn’t happen."

"Oh? I know that, Anthony. I’ve said it many times. I’m just saying that girl is wonderful, you know?"

<b>

Once again, she starts to assert that she understands the concept of moderation. 

That's why in such matters... Please, just spare me, Carrie.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next head of Amkam is enrolling in the academy.

That fact has caused quite a stir within this academy.

<b>

If you’re from this Karais state, almost no one is unaware of the name Amkam or its brand.

Amkam is the production area for high-end goods derived from magical beasts.

Utilizing their experience with magical beasts, it’s the hometown of specialists who undertake magical beast extermination across various regions.

That’s generally how people perceive Amkam.

<b>

However, not many understand its true nature.

It’s not a place for the faint-hearted to meddle in. If one touches its reverse scales, it could topple even a nation.

The true form of Amkam is not something that should be made public. Only those who need to know should understand it.

We have managed to maintain that relationship, that balance, well in this town until now.

From now on, we must build that relationship well with her as well.

<b>

<b>

In the future, those who only see the benefits of Amkam will likely try to ingratiate themselves with her.

However, it’s entirely undesirable for her or Amkam to be disturbed by such half-hearted individuals.

Such situations must not occur, nor do we intend to let them happen.

<b>

Does she realize that this tea party was effectively the top-level meeting within the academy? No, according to Colin, she said that girl is not the type to think in that direction.

Well, that’s fine.

What matters is that the fact that the three of us met exists. For now, as long as that is conveyed to everyone, that is enough.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, I was released from the lounge more than 30 minutes after the president arrived.

I was released because I had a prior engagement... in other words, I had to shift my shift at the tea house by an hour, or I wouldn’t make it out of the academy in time.

After all, completely skipping work would reflect poorly on the academy’s reputation!

Carrie... Lady Caroline, finally had a face that seemed to give up and came to the entrance of the lounge to send me off.

<b>

"You can use this lounge anytime you want, so feel free to come whenever you like, okay? Next time, let’s talk more leisurely?"

"Y-yes, I will..."

"Right! Next time, bring that girl... yes! Miss Cordelia Casper with you. You two are good friends, aren’t you?"

"Uh, um..."

<b>

Colin said that this tea party was just a mere 'meet and greet,' but it felt like quite a dense and exhausting time.

As Colin said, I understood that Lady Caroline has a good personality, but there’s something about her that reminds me of Carla and the others... I have a real sense of crisis that if I’m not careful, I might genuinely be taken away! I can feel it strongly!

<b>

"It was truly a meaningful time. I look forward to working with you in the future."

"Likewise, I look forward to it."

<b>

I heard a little about the student council’s situation from Lady Lineburger, and it seems they’re having various troubles.

<b>

"No, Victor does a good job of keeping things together. ...He does manage to keep things together."

<b>

She spoke somewhat gently about their struggles, but if the main cause is due to the people from Amkam, I can’t help but feel a sense of responsibility...

<b>

<b>

<b>

Victor Frank is in the same grade as Carla and the others, two years older than us, and he’s the brother of Mary and Shelley, and also a mysterious entity X!

<b>

On the day we moved in, after the "Tragedy of the Rose Garden" occurred... well, it wasn’t actually a "tragedy" but... it wasn’t, you know!!

When we were heading to the dining hall for dinner, it came.

As usual, without a sound or presence, it approached unnoticed.

<b>

But! Not anymore!

I’m not the same as I used to be!

As it crept up behind me, I swiftly thrust out my elbow into its path.

The perfectly timed elbow struck its water moon, and it let out a sound that one wouldn’t expect from a human, "Ugeibaro-boooouuu!!" and flew backward!

<b>

YES!!

<b>

Hmph! I won’t be caught off guard like before! Even an unseen opponent is easy for me to catch now!

For me, Victor’s terror is no longer something to fear! I’m no longer that young me from back then...

"Impressive, baby... I’m truly moved to see how much you’ve grown! Now, I’ll gently escort you from here, baby."

<b>

I involuntarily widened my eyes and froze.

Victor, who should have flown backward, was right there. At my feet! Between my legs!! Lying on his back and looking up at me!!

<b>

W-where are you looking?!!!

On top of that, he was whispering sweet nothings while crawling his fingers along my legs, moving with just the right amount of pressure!

"Iiiiiiiiiiyaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!"

A rush of air burst from my throat, and a scream from my soul echoed around.

At the same time, I stomped down hard on the face of the pervert on the floor! I heard a sound like something being crushed, but I continued to stomp!

<b>

That black thing won’t die from something like this! It can’t be exterminated like this!!

Immediately, Carla, Jessica, Alicia, and Dana, who noticed my voice, rushed in and joined me in stomping the G-class pest!

Hiiiii! It moved! Is it still alive?!! Wow! It’s fast?!!

No, don’t let it escape! No, absolutely not!! It will definitely grow back! It will grow back!!

...!...........!!..............!!!!!!

<b>

<b>

Thus, my reunion with Victor was a horrifyingly noisy affair...

<b>

But can you believe that someone like that is not only popular among girls second only to the student council president but also the vice president of the student council?!!

It’s shocking, right?! I can’t believe the senior girls’ nerves!

They must all be deceived! It has to be! Even though he looks good, that’s all there is to it! Just looks!!

<b>

After that, Alphonse’s Arrow from the student council was, after all, a normal person and very much a gentleman!

Normal is nice, really, I admire it! I think a gentleman like Arrow would be much more popular than the entity X, Victor! I really do!

<b>

But thanks to that popularity among girls, it seems he effectively mediates troubles between students (especially among female students!).

Lady Lineburger said so.

<b>

However, beyond that, it seems Victor is also the one who brings troublesome matters to the student council...

Yeah, I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry for the people from Amkam!

<b>

Thus, feeling indebted to Lady Lineburger and trembling at the thought of Lord Goldberg!

This oddly tense tea party came to an end.

<b>

I’m exhausted, really...

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

Since I couldn’t make it to work on time, I had asked Karen to go ahead.

Of course, she wasn’t alone. Meruru and Selkie were with her.

After the morning’s commotion, I hadn’t had a proper conversation with Karen, so I was a bit worried, but I’ve asked Selkie to look after her, so it should be fine. There are also seniors at the workplace!

It’s probably better to have a proper conversation after returning and settling down.

I don’t think it’s something that needs to be rushed.

<b>

While Karen and the others went ahead, Bibi and Mia said they would wait for me.

After all, they want to rank up in the union together! That’s what Bibi said.

Bibi is such a good friend, really!

<b>

I’m supposed to meet them at the main gate, but since I’m a bit late, I walked a little faster down the forest path.

Then, for some reason, I sensed Bibi and the others along the way. And it wasn’t just Bibi and Mia who were there.

...Is that Miss Cordelia?

Why are Bibi and Miss Cordelia facing off in a place like this?

<b>

As I got closer, I could see Mia standing next to Bibi with an indescribably exasperated expression.

The two attendants of Miss Cordelia seemed to be flustered and in a bit of a panic.

<b>

<b>

"I don’t want you to think that I’m the only one with a familiar since I’m a novice!"

<b>

Miss Cordelia suddenly said something.

She pointed her finger sharply at Bibi.

What’s going on? Is she about to start some kind of performance?

<b>

"Oh, really!"

<b>

In response, Bibi gave a disinterested reply!

On her shoulder, Algernon was twitching his nose, seemingly interested unlike his owner.

<b>

"Look! My familiar! Although still a young one, it will eventually grow into a divine beast (hopefully), in its fierce form!!"

<b>

Whoa! Miss Cordelia seems to be really hyped up?!!

Oh, the two attendants noticed me.

<b>

"Th-that’s not it, Lord Cloud! M-Miss Cordelia has lost herself a bit... her way of speaking is a little! Just a little! Um! That!"

<b>

They seem to be on the verge of clinging to me? The taller one also looks a bit pale, but in sync with her partner, she’s nodding vigorously. Is it just my imagination, or do these two seem completely different from how they were this morning?

On the first day of school, they seemed to move quite briskly as Miss Cordelia’s attendants...

Now, I feel like they give off a considerably different impression.

<b>

Oh, the one looking pale shouldn’t push herself too hard. If she’s feeling unwell, she should rest quickly.

Right, one of the herbs Sonia Mom gave me is supposed to improve circulation and lead to healthy sleep. I should have Anna Mary take it to her later.

<b>

"Come forth! Sturgeon!!"

<b>

Miss Cordelia raised her voice proudly, still pointing her right hand at Bibi.

Then, in response to her voice, a white shadow swiftly moved at her feet.

It climbed up her body and stood proudly at the tip of her outstretched right hand.

<b>

Hmm? Is that a white kitten?

No, it’s too slender and long! Its ears are round, and its face is small!

That’s it! It’s a weasel! A tiny weasel!!

Including its tail, it’s about 10 centimeters? It’s less than half of Algernon’s 30 centimeters!

It’s making little squeaky sounds, twitching its nose!

Wow, it’s so small it could fit in the palm of my hand!

Oh no! This thing is adorable! It’s so cute!!

<b>

"Now! Behold! This little one is my familiar, connected to the divine beast Blanc Lunare! If it grows like this, it will eventually become a divine beast! The founder of my Casper family was renowned as a great tamer who controlled divine beasts! I too will eventually become a legendary 'Fantastica Tamer' alongside this little one! Right now! You are witnessing the first step of that legend!!"

<b>

Miss Cordelia seems to be saying something proudly, but my attention is completely glued to the little white animal on her hand!

<b>

What is this thing, what is this thing?!

Its black, beady eyes are sparkling!

Standing on its hind legs, with its front paws extended, it’s making squeaky sounds!

This little one is just too cute! So cute!!

<b>

"Huh?!"

"Sturgeon?!"

<b>

As I was melting over its cuteness, Algernon and the weasel suddenly jumped off their owners' shoulders and ran off.

The two of them quickly reached the midpoint between the two confronting girls and faced each other.

Bibi and Miss Cordelia were surprised and exclaimed at the sudden movement of the two little animals, but the little creatures began communicating with each other, seemingly ignoring their owners' surprise.

<b>

Algernon stood on his hind legs, looking down at the weasel.

In a normal natural setting, I think mice are prey to weasels... Yet, Algernon seems to be acting all high and mighty in front of an opponent that’s only about half his size! He’s puffing out his chest while making squeaky sounds.

In contrast, the weasel is bowing its head in a gesture of submission!

Wow! That was super cute just now?!

<b>

"...huh."

"St-Sturgeon?!!"

<b>

Whoa, did they just establish a hierarchy among the little animals? Even though Algernon is bigger, is it a fantasy that a mouse is above a weasel?

The reactions of the two owners watching this scene are quite contrasting.

Bibi seems to be smirking as if to say she won, while Miss Cordelia has a face that looks like she’s about to cry, which doesn’t suit her strong demeanor at all.

<b>

Well, is it the world of familiars? Relationships and customs? I don’t really understand, but maybe they’re having some sort of exchange or discussion about that?

Algernon seems to be instructing the weasel about something.

But just because the other one is tiny, isn’t Algernon being a bit too domineering? He looks quite arrogant, squeaking away!

<b>

"Eh? Eh? A-Algernon? What are you saying?! What are you doing?! Hey! You...!"

"N-n-n-n-n-n, what? Sturgeon? S-Sturgeon?!!"

<b>

Huh? What’s going on? Both of their owners are starting to panic? What’s happening?

The two little animals turned their noses towards me and ran straight towards me.

Oh? Is Algernon bringing that little one over to me? Oh, how thoughtful of you!

Come on, little one, jump into my arms! I’ll give you plenty of cuddles!!

<b>

Without looking away, the two of them jumped up right in front of me, kicking off the ground and flying towards my chest in a parabolic arc.

Uuuhh~~! Fluffy against my chest~~...

But! That feeling of fluffiness lasted only a moment.

<b>

"Nyah?! Nyah! Nnuh! Nnnyahihyahaah! Huh?! Ah! Nnyahhhhhh!!!"

<b>

The moment they reached my chest, those little creatures, unbelievably, dove right inside my shirt through the gap!!

W-what the! Algernon! Wait! W-where are you going?! No, no!!

<b>

"Nnyah! Nnyahnyah!! Hyauu!!"

<b>

These little guys are doing something outrageous! Inside my shirt, they’re moving around in all sorts of ways!

I could only be tossed around by it, writhing, my waist giving way, and I could do nothing but let out strange screams.

<b>

Finally, exhausted, I collapsed to the ground, breathing heavily with my hands on the ground.

Then, from the gap in my shirt, two white shadows popped out. The recoil made my body twitch even more.

<b>

The larger one, Algernon, stood before me, making a proud sound like "Kikyuukikyuukyu!" as if to show off.

The smaller one, the weasel, also responded with a clear "Pukiki!" sound!

<b>

...I somehow understood their conversation!

It was something like, "This is how to please the lady! Got it?!" from Algernon!

And the weasel was like, "Understood, boss!" in response?! Huh?! Hey!!

<b>

"Ah, A-A-Algernon! What are you saying... What are you doing?! You!!!"

"S-S-S-Sturgeon?! Sturgeon! W-what are you... what are you doing?!!!"

<b>

At the same time as the cries of their two owners echoed around, the white furballs dashed away from the scene!

It was as if you could see the words "Pew!" written in the air as they disappeared perfectly!!

<b>

"Uh, um, this is, this is, um, this is that! That!"

"Ahhhhhh, I-I’m so sorry, Lord Cloud! I-I-I’m so sorry!!!"

<b>

The voices of Bibi, who was cautiously approaching, and Miss Cordelia, who was apologizing while retreating...

But I had no room to respond to either of them.

With my soul barely peeking out of my mouth, I could only tremble and shake my body!

What a humiliation!!

Y-you little creatures!!!
