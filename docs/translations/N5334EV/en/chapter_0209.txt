"Su! Answer me! Please answer me!! Damn it... This can't be a joke, right? Su! Su!!!"

<b>

"What the hell is going on... Damn it! Those aristocrats...! It's my fault for letting the survivors go! Su! Please, just answer me!!"

<b>

"It should have been over three months since the situation on your side started. Is it still not settled? ...Or could it be... no way. No! That can't be!"

<b>

"Su! Please! Just stay alive! ...Otherwise, I... I will!"

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"...... As expected, there are no signs of communication... Zero reception records for the past year..."

<b>

"I have sent many people to your side, but I still can't find a trace of you... It seems that..."

<b>

"I have reduced the power of the aristocrats economically and militarily! The groundwork I have laid for a long time is finally bearing fruit! The democratization of this world you aimed for is right in front of us!!"

<b>

"...... Damn it! Why is this happening! What did you do? Suddenly brought to this world! Torn away from your family! Celebrated as a hero, only to be burdened with the responsibility of defeat and sacrificed! And now, to lose your life like this?! Don't mess with me!!!"

<b>

"In the end... In the end, I couldn't protect you! Not for this world! Damn it! Damn it!!!"

<b>

"I absolutely cannot forgive this world that took everything from you! This world that took you from me!!"

<b>

"I understand... I understand, Su. But it doesn't matter. A world without you... I... I! ...Su. ...Su!!"

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"...... Su, I understand the meaning of the inscription."

<b>

"I've decided... I will aim for the other side of the door."

<b>

"I know, Su. You wouldn't allow such a thing. ...Indeed, I have things I want to protect in this world as well."

<b>

"But it doesn't matter, Su! In a world without you!!"

<b>

"...... I have decided to play along with his words. I know where the stone is. I won't rely on the power of a god that does nothing but exist!"

<b>

"And I will obtain the cup. No matter how heinous the act may be..."

<b>

"It's okay... It's okay, Su."

<b>

"If I can reach the door that exists in all continuous time... If there's a possibility of meeting you again there... I will! Even if it means this world will perish as a result!"

<b>

"It's okay, Su. We will meet again. I will make it happen! ...Suzuka!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Su-chan, wake up."

<b>

With Alma's quiet yet slightly tense voice, I instantly wake up.

The voice is coming from outside the tent.

Reflexively, I look at the folding clock placed by my pillow inside the tent, and it indicates that it's almost 11 PM.

It's still a bit early for the change of the night watch.

I see, it's an emergency.

I immediately crawl out of my sleeping bag, inform Alma that I'm awake, put on my gear, and step outside the tent.

<b>

"Multiple hostile reactions are heading this way from a wide area. We've already intercepted several, but I want you to be prepared for an ambush too, Su-chan."

"An ambush... you mean, even you can't fully grasp the enemy?"

"There are quite a few moving underground. I can't pinpoint their exact locations in the soil."

"That's troublesome."

<b>

Alma's detection magic captures the vibrations in the air to grasp the situation within the detection range.

If it's something moving on the ground or flying in the air, she can almost completely grasp it...

Truly, Alma's detection magic is incredible.

<b>

However, when moving underground, it can be detected to some extent by the vibrations of their movement, but unfortunately, their exact positions cannot be determined.

<b>

"I wish it were something like that."

<b>

As she says this, Alma directs her gaze toward the mountains ahead.

Far in the distance, two magical beasts are flying toward us.

About 500 meters away. At an altitude of about 100 meters?

In this moonlight, it's still difficult to visually identify them at this distance. I can tell from my own exploration, but Alma must be detecting them with her magic as well.

<b>

They were flying at quite a speed.

Since their bodies are relatively large, once they get within 100 meters, I can easily track them with my eyes.

Those are magical beasts called "Pygmirelf," large predatory birds.

They are nearly 2 meters long. Their legs are disproportionately long compared to a normal eagle. Their claws are large enough to easily grasp a person.

<b>

As they approached within 50 to 60 meters, Alma raised her hand to her chest and cast a spell with a single hand gesture.

"Resonance Slash."

With Alma's call, a line of light was drawn from the ground to the sky. A high-pitched sound like ringing echoed around us.

<b>

The line moved while emitting yellow light, crossing the bodies of the predatory birds. At the same time, their bodies were cleanly sliced where the light traced.

The dying screams of the magical beasts echoed in the night sky.

<b>

Following that, the second and third lines ran through the air.

Alma's fingertips moved intricately, manipulating the lines.

<b>

Multiple lines further sliced the bodies of the magical beasts.

The magical beasts were now like shredded paper.

Wow, that's brutal... I thought as I looked at Alma, but she seemed to have a slightly serious expression.

<b>

When I turned my gaze back to the remains of the magical beasts, I noticed something strange about their movements.

They should be falling, caught in the wind, but... they're wriggling?

Wait? Are the fragments sticking together in mid-air?

<b>

"That's a 'Linear Magical Lifeform' that Nosori found."

<b>

Morris-sensei, who had appeared beside me without me noticing, spoke up.

I see, that wriggling thing has such a name. I had no idea. Huh? Was I just not paying attention?

<b>

In the meantime, the fragments of the magical beasts were increasingly sticking together. Are they healing faster than the magical beasts I saw in the city?

And several pieces finally formed into one mass!

Incredibly, the two magical beasts merged into one!!

But it looks all messy. It has four wings but can't fly at all, and it's still falling!

Isn't that just a lump of meat?! Gross!!

<b>

At that moment, Alma snapped her fingers.

Then, a particularly thick line of light shot up toward the mass of magical beast meat in the sky.

<b>

The moment the light pillar hit the mass, a loud sound echoed, and the lump of meat exploded.

What a filthy firework...

<b>

"These guys are a hassle because they don't just end with being sliced."

"Indeed! As Seiwas-kun said, injecting high-pressure magical power is effective!"

<b>

Alma had been systematically eliminating the magical beasts that entered her detection range like this.

It seems she deliberately let the two magical beasts come close to demonstrate for me.

<b>

"It's easy when they come from the sky."

<b>

Enemies coming from the open sky, with no cover, are merely targets for Alma, who expands her detection range.

She can shoot them down one by one as they enter her detection range.

<b>

But, you know... Alma continued.

<b>

"With the chips scattered today, I can't deal damage to enemies underground."

<b>

Alma said this with a slightly regretful tone.

I see. That's why she told me to be on guard.

<b>

It's possible that enemies could come from extremely high altitudes outside the detection range, but in that case, they can just aim and shoot once the targets enter the detection range.

However, if they suddenly appear from underground, we can only strike where they emerge.

It's like playing whack-a-mole over a wide area, which becomes quite troublesome.

<b>

So far, they haven't appeared at close range, but if multiple magical beasts suddenly show up right in front of me, it would be extremely problematic.

<b>

"That's why I want you to be on guard, Su-chan."

"I see."

<b>

With that, I also began to search the area with my exploration.

Then... there they are.

I confirmed multiple hostile reactions heading this way in my exploration.

The closest one is less than a kilometer away. About 500 to 600 meters?

<b>

I drew my silver sword from the sword holster at my waist and aimed it at the nearest target with just my right hand.

It's moving in a zigzag underground. Is it avoiding hard rock layers and choosing easier places to dig?

The creature is a magical beast called "Earthworm," about the size of a large dog.

<b>

There might be various rocky layers in the line of fire, but it should be fine.

I infused a little "Qi" into the tip of the sword held out in my right hand and fired a thin, concentrated "Impact Blaster."

<b>

The compressed "Qi" pushed aside the surrounding atmosphere. The sword energy transformed into white light and extended.

It reached the mountainside in front of me and pierced through it in an instant.

In the next moment, I felt the impact of my technique reaching the target. After a brief pause, I could tell the ground beyond the mountain had exploded.

After lowering the sword tip and waiting a moment, a heavy sound of impact echoed back to us.

<b>

"...... Su-chan, that's overkill. You went too far."

"Huh?"

"If you keep shooting things like that, the terrain around here will change drastically!!"

<b>

I received criticism from Alma and Morris-sensei!

It seems Alma can also confirm the situation at the scene with her detection magic. Amazing, Alma's magic can even tell that.

According to her, a pretty big crater has formed at the foot of the mountain...

<b>

Oh no... Is my "Qi" still too abundant?

Do I need to refine it further? Ugh... What should I do?

<b>

"Why not try aiming at multiple targets at once?"

"Huh?"

<b>

Alma's casual suggestion made me think, "Hmm."

<b>

I could use that technique I employed in the city, where I targeted the wriggling creatures all over the dog's body at once.

That way, I can aim at many at once, but the power of each would be significantly reduced.

Maybe I should give it a try.

<b>

I drew another silver sword and raised both hands, pointing the two swords upward.

I then used my exploration to grasp all the enemies within my detection range.

I captured a total of 64 creatures. Among them, 31 are underground. Quite a few.

But the number I need to target is less than a hundred. This should be easy♪

I firmly locked onto each one and unleashed an "Impact Blaster" all at once.

<b>

The "Impact Blaster" shot into the sky and immediately exploded like fireworks.

Then, the finely divided white lines fell toward each targeted creature.

A series of impact sounds echoed as they pierced the ground. Alright, there wasn't any significant dust cloud rising!

<b>

As for the targeted creatures... well, no problem. They all exploded beautifully.

How's that, audience?! I glanced back at Alma, only to find her staring intently at a point in mid-air.

<b>

"...... Yeah, the damage to the surface isn't too significant. Not that much..."

<b>

It seems she's checking the situation around the impact points with her detection magic.

According to her, while there are many holes scattered around, there aren't any large craters... apparently.

But not large ones! ...She emphasized.

<b>

"With that, all the magical beasts in this area, including those underground, are annihilated. There are still 20 to 30 kilometers away, but I think it will take them over an hour to reach here."

<b>

Alma says she will crush any magical beasts that come into sight, so there's no need to rush.

<b>

"But why did they suddenly attack now? Until now, there haven't been any magical beast attacks, right?"

"It seems wild animals occasionally came close, but they say they've never seen magical beasts."

<b>

Morris-sensei seems to have summarized what the part-timers have heard.

According to the part-timers who have been here for a week, there were no magical beasts from the beginning.

That makes sense. It's not like this is Amukamu, where magical beasts attack as soon as you enter the forest.

Exactly! This isn't Amukamu!

<b>

<b>

"It's strange, isn't it? Did something special happen?"

<b>

For so many magical beasts to suddenly gather and attack in a place that isn't even their territory, something special must have occurred.

What could be here?

As I voiced that question, for some reason, Morris-sensei and Alma looked at me with strangely warm eyes. ...Huh? The part-timers too?

<b>

"...... W-what is it?"

<b>

I tilted my head slightly and asked.

<b>

"Su-chan... could it be you?"

"Indeed! It's likely the princess's magical power."

"Eh?"

<b>

Are Alma and Morris-sensei saying it's my fault? Why? What do they mean?!

"If you release that much magical power all at once, it's no wonder it stands out! It's not surprising that the magical beasts reacted!"

<b>

No! Sure, it's my magical power, but?! 

I didn't use it!

Isn't it unfair to say it's my fault like that?!

Can I pout a little?!

<b>

"Also, it seems there's someone who doesn't want this place to be disturbed... perhaps?"

"Alma?"

"That someone felt threatened by the overwhelming amount of magical power released... or something like that?"

"...... What do you mean?"

"That there might be something here."

"............"

<b>

I wanted to protest a little! I took a deep breath, but Alma's voice and expression as she gazed somewhere had no warmth at all.

In that state, I couldn't help but feel bewildered and hold my breath.

<b>

What on earth is Alma trying to say?

Just as I was about to ask her the meaning, I detected a single reaction approaching us at high speed.

It was quite small. And it didn't show any hostile reactions.

<b>

Even though it was night, I quickly caught sight of it.

It was wrapped in a familiar magical power.

That's the "Dove" clay golem. It must be something Vivi sent. I can clearly feel that child's magical power.

The "Dove" flew straight toward us at considerable speed. It was probably over 100 kilometers per hour.

<b>

Even so, as it got closer, it spread its wings to slow down and quickly reduced its speed.

Then it descended slowly right in front of me.

I raised my left arm to welcome the "Dove" to my eye level. The "Dove" landed on my arm without hesitation.

I brought the "Dove" close to my forehead to "communicate."

As the "Dove" touched my forehead, the message contained within flowed into me.

<b>

"We are currently repelling a large-scale attack at the campsite! Please join us urgently!"

<b>

Vivi's urgent voice echoed in my mind.

It must have been a real emergency. Normally, the "Dove" can carry a much longer message, but all that was contained was this short sentence.

<b>

"...... What happened?"

"It seems the 'Outdoor Class' is under attack."

<b>

I quietly answered Alma's question.

We had arranged to communicate via doves in case something happened with Vivi and the others.

This urgent message from Vivi.

If it's those kids, they should be able to handle a few magical beasts that might appear in this area, which isn't Amukamu.

They would usually manage things on their own.

However, the message from the dove conveyed that the situation was urgent.

<b>

The director and others were concerned about the possibility of an attack.

But for such emergencies, they had assigned several bouncing teams like Rudori and others.

Even so, for them to send for reinforcements like this... it shows how urgent the situation is.

Alma mentioned earlier that there might be something here.

In this mountain where Karen's family resides, and where her misfortune began.

<b>

The magical beasts attacked as soon as the investigation of this mountain began.

Moreover, they are all magical beasts that possess the ability to heal rapidly and harbor the aforementioned wriggling creatures within them.

Are these unrelated to the magical beasts that attacked Karen and the others in the city?

And at the same time, the "Outdoor Class" where Karen is now is also under attack.

Who on earth is attacking them?

Where is the missing former eldest son now?

<b>

Something within me was beginning to connect.

<b>

"You’re going, aren’t you, Su-chan?"

"Can I leave this to you?"

"Don't worry. Thanks to you, we have time to prepare countermeasures."

<b>

Alma was carving some kind of mark on the surface of the wooden chips she took out from her waist pouch.

<b>

"I'll scatter these new ones."

"Those are Batin runes, right?"

<b>

As I watched Alma mass-produce the carved chips, Morris-sensei explained what she was carving.

He was directing the part-timers next to me, who were running around with various supplies.

<b>

"Each of those characters contains magical effects. Alma-nee-chan is a user of Batin magic."

<b>

Batin magic is an ancient magic that has been lost in modern times.

In school lessons, there's only a line stating that it was once a lineage of magic that existed, but nothing more is known.

Alma is said to be a user of such magic.

Could it be that this person is incredibly talented?

No, I realized how amazing she was throughout the day... but I still can't see the bottom of her abilities.

<b>

"With this, I can send echoes underground and accurately pinpoint locations. Moreover, I can activate magic at the locations I detect."

<b>

As she said this, Alma began to scatter the newly carved chips into the wind.

The magic that can be activated is said to be "Stone Seal," a spell that seals the target into stone.

Since it's activated underground, its effectiveness is said to be quite high... Truly, it's "inside the stone"!

<b>

"I'm ready over here!"

<b>

When I looked over at Morris-sensei, who raised his voice, he was holding a square box with stick-like objects protruding from it.

What is that? It looks like something often used to trigger explosions?

<b>

"I'm going to use the 'Rock Forging' layered cylindrical magic circle that I prepared for situations like this! The adapter for repurposing the magical power stored in the magic accumulation container filled with the princess's magical power is also connected! With this, we can use it almost endlessly! Gahaha!"

<b>

Oh wow! Thank you for "being prepared for situations like this!"

Thank you!

<b>

The "Rock Forging" magic creates sturdy stone walls and is used for constructing fortifications and defenses.

If a large amount of magical power is infused, walls can even be created underground, making it effective against enemies approaching from below, as in this case.

The part-timers have been running around setting up the "Rock Forging" layered cylindrical magic circles around the campsite. The trigger switch that Morris-sensei is holding seems to be the activation switch for that.

<b>

"So you can go without worry."

"Thank you, Alma. And Morris-sensei, please don't overdo it."

<b>

As Alma continued to scatter the chips into the wind, she said this.

I expressed my gratitude and conveyed my hope that Morris-sensei wouldn't overexert himself.

The two of them smiled and sent me off with "Go ahead."

<b>

I immediately started running from there. I was already fully equipped. My destination is the natural park at the foot of the Rohang volcano, where I was until this morning.

I will return to the location of the "Outdoor Class" with all my might.

There probably isn't much time left. But I will definitely make it in time.

<b>

That's right! I should use that thing I improved while consulting with Seiwas-sensei.

This time, I will definitely break through the sound barrier.
