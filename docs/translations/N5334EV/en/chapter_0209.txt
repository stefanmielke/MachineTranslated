Tin! Answer me! Answer me! Damn it, ...... you're kidding, right? Tin! Tin!

<blank>

What the hell, this ....... Damn! Those aristocrats ......! It's my fault for missing the survivors! Tin! Please answer me!

<blank>

It must have been more than three months ago. Hasn't the situation there calmed down yet? ............ or ...... No way. No way! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! It can't be!

<blank>

Tin! Please! Stay alive! If not for ......, I'd be ...... me!"

<blank>

<blank>



<blank>

<blank>

"............ still no sign of any communication ...... and no record of receipt in the past year ...... "

<blank>

I've sent many of you out there and I still can't find a trace of you ....... After all, you're already on ......."

<blank>

We have reduced the power of the aristocrats both economically and in terms of strength! The long process of laying the groundwork is beginning to bear fruit! The democratization of this world, which you have been striving for, is just around the corner!

<blank>

"............ Damn it! Why are you doing this? What have you done? Suddenly you're brought into a world like this! Stripped from your family! You've been feted as a hero, and then you're forced to take the blame for your defeat, and you're a human sacrifice! And then you come all this way, and in the end your life is taken away like this? You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

After all ...... I can't protect you in the end! You for this world! Damn you! Damn you!

<blank>

I just can't forgive you! This world that took everything from you! This world that took you from me!

<blank>

'I know ...... I know, tin. But no. In a world like this without you,...... I'm not,...... I'm not! ...... Tin. ............ tin!

<blank>

<blank>



<blank>

<blank>

'...... tin, I see now what the inscription means.'

<blank>

I've decided to go to ....... I'm going beyond the door."

<blank>

I know, Tin. I know you wouldn't allow that to happen. ...... certainly made me and this world what I want to protect."

<blank>

'But it's no good, Tin! Not in this world without you!

<blank>

I decided to take him up on his offer: "............. I know where the stone is. I'm not relying on the power of a god who does nothing but stay!"

<blank>

And then we will get the sake cup. No matter how outrageous the deed may be. ......"

<blank>

"It's all right ....... It's okay, Tin."

<blank>

If I can reach the end of the door that exists in all successive times,...... if there is a possibility that I can see you again,...... I will! Even if it means the end of this world!"

<blank>

It's okay, Tin. We'll meet again. I'll show you! ...... Ryoka!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

-***** --****--****--****--****--****--****--****--****--****-

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Sue, wake up.

<blank>

Alma's quiet but slightly tense voice wakes me up instantly.

The voice is from outside the tent.

Reflexively, I looked at the folding clock on the bedside table in the tent and saw that it was about to strike eleven at night.

It is still a little early for the night watchman's shift.

I see. So it's an emergency.

I immediately crawl out of my sleeping bag, tell Alma I'm awake, put on my gear, and head out of the tent.

<blank>

We have multiple hostile reactions heading toward us from a wide area. We've already intercepted several, but I want you to be prepared for a surprise attack.

"It's a surprise ......, huh? A partner that even Mr. Alma can't fully grasp?"

There are a lot of things moving around in the ground. It's hard to get a clear picture of where they are when they're in the ground.

It's tricky, you know.

<blank>

Alma-san's search-and-destroy magic captures the vibrations of the air and the situation within the search-and-destroy range.

If something is going on the ground or flying in the sky, they can almost completely grasp it. ......

I'm glad to see that Alma's search magic is outrageous.

<blank>

However, when they are moving underground, they can be captured to some extent by the vibrations of their movement, but unfortunately, they cannot tell their exact location.

<blank>

It would be easier if it was something like that."

<blank>

As she says this, Alma turns her face toward the mountain top ahead of her.

Far beyond the line of sight, two demonic beasts are flying toward us.

The distance is about 500 meters. 100 meters above the ground?

In this moonlight, it is still difficult to see them at such a distance. I know this from my own search, but Alma must have caught it with her own search magic.

<blank>

These guys were flying pretty fast.

Since he is also quite large, he can be followed by eye when the distance is less than 100 meters.

It is a large raptor magical beast called a "pigmyrf".

It is nearly two meters long. Its legs are unbalancedly long and huge compared to those of a normal eagle. Its claws are large enough to grab a person with ease.

<blank>

When the distance was close to 5 to 60 meters, Alma raised her hand to her chest and chanted the magic name as if making a sign with one hand.

Resonance Slash

With Alma's call, a line of light was drawn from the ground to the sky. A high-pitched sound like a ringing in the ears echoed around the area.

<blank>

The line moved across the raptors, emitting a yellow light. At the same time, their bodies were neatly sliced apart where the light had traced them.

The cries of the demonic beasts echoed in the night sky.

<blank>

Continuing further, the second and third lines run in the sky.

Alma's fingertips move minutely as if manipulating a line.

<blank>

Multiple lines cut the bodies of the magical beasts into even finer pieces.

The beasts are like shredded pieces of paper.

Wow, that's eggy. ....... I looked at Alma thinking, but she looks a little difficult somehow.

<blank>

I looked again at the wreckage of the magical beasts in front of Alma's eyes and saw that ...... something was wrong with their movements.

It's supposed to be falling in the wind, but it's ......, something unnyo?

What's that? Did the pieces stick to each other in mid-air?

<blank>

That's the linear magical life form that Mr. Nosoli found, isn't it?

<blank>

Dr. Morris, who had come to stand by my side before I knew it, said so.

Oh, I didn't know they named those swellings that way. I had no idea. What? I just didn't hear about it?

<blank>

In the meantime, the pieces of the hexenbiests are sticking together more and more. Are they more resilient than the demonic beasts we saw in the city before?

And finally, the many fragments became a single mass!

What a surprise, the two magical beasts became one!

But it's kind of a mess. It has four wings, but it's not flying at all, and it's still falling!

That's just a lump of meat, isn't it? Gross!

<blank>

Then Alma snaps one finger.

Then a line of light, one of the thickest, stretched up toward the mass of demon beast flesh above.

<blank>

At the moment when the pillar of light hit the mass, the mass of flesh exploded with a violent sound.

It's a dirty firework or .......

<blank>

These guys are a pain in the ass because you can't just cut them open and be done with it.

"Mm! As Mr. Seiwashi said, it is effective to use high-pressure magic!"

<blank>

I heard that Mr. Alma used to dispose of magical beasts that came within his search range by blasting them from one side to the other, as he is doing now.

The two bodies now seem to have been let off the hook and brought this close for the purpose of demonstrating them to me.

<blank>

It's easy to come in from the sky.

<blank>

An enemy from the sky with nothing to shield it is a mere target for Mr. Alma, who spreads his search over a wide area.

They shoot down the objects in the search range one after the other, and that's the end of it.

<blank>

But you know, ......, Alma continues.

<blank>

With the chips we've scattered today, we don't have the power to strike a subterranean opponent.

<blank>

A little frustrated, Alma says.

I see. So that's why you told me to be on the lookout.

<blank>

It's possible that they could come from very high altitude out of the search range, but then you just have to aim and fire when the target is in the search range.

However, if it suddenly appears out of the ground, the only way is to hit it where it comes out.

That's already like playing whack-a-mole over a wide area, and it can be quite messy.

<blank>

So far they haven't appeared at close range, but if multiple magical beasts suddenly appeared right in front of us, it would be very troublesome.

<blank>

That's why I'd like you to be on the lookout for Sue."

I see.

<blank>

Then, I also explored the area by searching.

Then you're at .............

My search also revealed several hostile reactions coming toward us.

The closest ones are less than a kilometer apart. Roughly 5 to 600 meters?

<blank>

He draws a silvery-white sword from the sword holster at his waist and takes aim at the nearest target with just one right hand.

They are moving very zigzaggingly through the ground. I wonder if they are avoiding the hard bedrock of the strata and picking out places where it is easy to dig?

There is an "earth balm," an ocellated magical beast about the size of a large dog.

<blank>

There may be all sorts of bedrock and other mess in the line of fire, but that's not a problem.

With his outstretched right hand, he lightly applied Ki to the tip of his sword and fired a thin, narrowly focused "Impact Blaster".

<blank>

A "thud" of compressed "Ki" pushed the atmosphere away! The compressed Ki pushed the atmosphere away. A white light of sword ki extends from the tip of the sword.

It reaches the mountainside in front of you and pierces it in an instant.

In the next instant, I felt a palpable sensation that the technique I had released had reached its target. A beat later, I could feel the earth beyond the mountain pop.

After a short pause, a shocking sound echoed up to us.

<blank>

"...... Sue, too much overkill. Too much."

Huh?"

If you keep shooting like that, you're going to change the terrain around here!

<blank>

Mr. Alma and Dr. Morris gave me a no-no!

It seems that Alma can also check the scene of the crime with her search magic. Alma's magic is amazing. I didn't know she could do that.

According to the report, it looks like a pretty big crater is forming at the base of the mountain. ......

<blank>

Ofu ....... Still too much "Ki" to put in?

You're saying I need to squeeze thinner? Noooo~...... what are you going to do about it?

<blank>

"...... why don't you just go after more than one at a time?"

"Nymm?"

<blank>

Alma's casual words made me think, 'Hmm.

<blank>

I was in town the other day and wondered if I could use that thing that targeted all the ungulates in the dog's body at once.

With that thing, you can aim at many things at once, but each one is much less powerful.

Let's give it a try.

<blank>

He also drew his other silver sword and raised both hands to thrust the two swords upward.

Continue the search and understand all the enemies within your search range.

We captured a total of 64 animals. Of these, 31 are in the ground. That's a lot.

But there are no more than a hundred to aim at. It's a piece of cake.

He captures each one firmly, and then fires the "Impact Blaster" at once.

<blank>

The "Impact Blaster" shot into the sky and immediately opened wide like a firework.

The finely divided white lines then fall toward their respective targets.

Immediately, a series of earth-piercing impacts rang out. Okay, there's no particularly big cloud of dust or anything!

<blank>

The target body I aimed at is ...... Mm, no problem. Everything is blowing up nicely.

What do you think, customer? I looked back at Ms. Alma and saw her staring at a point in the sky. She was staring at a point in the sky.

<blank>

"............ Yeah, there's not that much damage to the surface. Not that much. ......

<blank>

It also seems that they are using search magic to check the situation around the point of impact.

According to the report, there are bobbing holes here and there, but nothing like a big crater .......

The big one! ...... and the nail was stuck.

<blank>

Now all the monsters in the area have been wiped out, including the ones in the ground. They are still a couple of miles away, but it will be more than an hour before they come this way.

<blank>

We will destroy the monsters on the ground as soon as we see them, so there is no need to be in a hurry anymore. Alma says, "We are going to destroy the monsters on the ground as soon as we see them.

<blank>

But why did they attack us out of the blue? There have never been any attacks by hexenbiests before, have there?"

Wild animals have come close to him from time to time, but he says he has never seen any kind of magical beast.

<blank>

It seems that Dr. Morris has heard from the part-timers and put it all together.

According to the part-timers who have been here for a week, there were no magical beasts here from the beginning.

That's right. It's not like it's Amkam, and it's not every day you go into a forest and a hexenbiest attacks you.

Yes! It's not an amcam!

<blank>

<blank>

It's strange, isn't it? Is there something special going on?"

<blank>

There was no way that such a large number of magical beasts could suddenly gather in a place that was not their own territory and attack them, unless something special happened.

What in the world is here?

And that's why I mentioned the question to ....... For some reason, Dr. Morris and Alma gave me a strange, lukewarm look. I was just wondering why Dr. Morris and Ms. Alma were looking at me so strangely lukewarm. ...... I'm not sure what to do with the rest of it.

<blank>

"...... na, what, what?"

<blank>

I tilted my head a little and asked.

<blank>

Is it "Sue-chan ......?"

"Mm! Must be the Princess's magic."

Yes?"

<blank>

Are Mr. Alma and Dr. Morris both saying it's my fault? Why? What do you mean?

<blank>

The amount of magic power released all at once will be noticeable, no matter how much you want it to be! No wonder the monsters reacted.

<blank>

No, it's not! It's my magic power, of course! But?

I didn't use it!

Isn't it awful to say it like it's my fault?

Can I get a little bit miffed?

<blank>

"And then there's still ...... someone who doesn't want this place touched, like ......?"

Mr. Alma?"

Someone felt threatened by the amount of magic that was being released, that it was too much for them to handle. ......?"

"...... how would you say that?"

That something like that might be out there.

"............"

<blank>

Let's have a little protest," I breathed! I breathed, but there was no temperature in Alma's voice and expression as she spoke while staring off somewhere.

I gulp in bewilderment at the state of things.

<blank>

What in the world is Alma trying to say?

When I was about to ask him to tell me what he meant by that, I caught one of the reactions approaching me at high speed.

It is quite small. And it is not a hostile reaction.

<blank>

I immediately caught sight of it, even though it was nighttime.

I was wearing the familiar magic.

That's a clay golem "pigeon". It must have been flown by Bibi. I can clearly feel her magic.

The "pigeons" are flying in a straight line at a very high speed. The speed of the pigeons is probably more than 100 kilometers per hour.

<blank>

Still, when it gets close, it spreads its wings and brakes, instantly slowing down.

Then it slowly descended to right in front of me.

I raised my left arm to eye level to greet the "dove. Without hesitation, the "dove" fluttered up and attached itself to my arm.

Bring the "pigeon" close to your forehead in order to "commune" as it is.

When "Dove" touched his forehead, the message contained in it flowed in.

<blank>

A large scale attack is being intercepted at the campsite! Please join us as soon as possible!

<blank>

Bibi's urgent voice echoes in my head.

It must have been really urgent. The pigeon could have contained a much longer message, but all it contained was this short sentence.

<blank>

...... what's up?"

It looks like the "field trip" is under attack.

<blank>

I quietly answer Alma's question.

Bibi and the others had arranged to communicate with each other by pigeon in case of any problems.

Such is the urgent call from Bibi.

<blank>

Those kids should be able to handle a few magical beasts in this area, which is not Amkam, even if they spring up.

They will be able to handle most things on their own.

However, the message from the pigeons conveys the urgency of the situation.

<blank>

The chancellors were concerned about the possibility of a raid.

But for such an emergency, Rudri and his team of bouncers had several bouncer teams attached to them.

Still, it's a shame that they would come to ...... for reinforcements like this. The urgency of the situation is apparent.

<blank>

Alma said earlier, isn't there something here? I said.

Karen's family home is located on this mountain where her misfortune began.

<blank>

The demonic beasts attacked us as soon as we started investigating this mountain.

Moreover, they are all magical beasts with super-healing powers that keep Unyo in their bodies, for example.

Does this have anything to do with those hexenbiests who attacked Karen and her friends in the city that time?

And at the same time, the "outdoor class" where Karen is now is also under attack.

Who are these people who are attacking us?

Where is that missing former eldest son now?

<blank>

What was about to be connected to one in my mind.

<blank>

You're going, aren't you? Sue-chan."

"May I leave this to you, sir?"

I'll be fine. Thanks to you, I have time to prepare countermeasures."

<blank>

Alma was carving some kind of mark with her fingertips on the surface of the wooden chip she had taken out of the pochette at her waist.

<blank>

I'm going to spread this newly chopped up stuff all over the place.

Those are batine letters, aren't they?

<blank>

As I watched Alma mass-produce one chopped chip after another, Dr. Morris told me about the things he was chopping.

The teacher was giving instructions to the part-timers beside me. The part-timers were running around with their luggage.

<blank>

Each letter has its own magic effect. Sister Alma is a master of batine magic.

<blank>

Batine magic is an ancient magic that has been lost in modern times.

Even in school classes, there is only a sentence that says it is a line of magic that once existed, but we don't know anything about it in detail.

Alma says she is such a magician.

Is he a great person by any chance?

No, I've had enough of the greatness for one day. ...... I can't see the bottom of this person at all.

<blank>

With this, we can send echoes into the ground and pinpoint the exact location. We can then trigger the magic on the ground.

<blank>

With that said, Alma-san sends the newly chopped chips in her hand flying into the wind one after another.

The magic that can be invoked is called "Ishi-seize," a magic that seals the object in stone.

I heard that ...... is very effective because it is activated in the ground. It is truly "in the stone"!

<blank>

We're ready for you, too!"

<blank>

Dr. Morris raised his voice, and when I looked in his direction, he was holding a square box with some kind of stick-shaped object sticking out of it.

What is it? It looks like a switch that is often used to detonate an explosion.

<blank>

I'm going to use the stacked cylindrical magic circle of 'rock forging' that I prepared just in case something like this should happen! I've also connected an adapter to divert the magic power of the magic storage cabinet that Hime-san has filled with magic power! With this, you can use it almost unlimitedly! Gahahahaha!

<blank>

Oh, wow! I got it, "This could happen to you."

Thank you very much!

<blank>

This "rock forging" magic is used to create strong stone walls and is said to be used in the construction of fortifications and other defenses.

If the amount of magic power contained in the device is large enough, it can create walls in the ground, so it is expected to be effective against enemies who approach from underground, as in this case.

<blank>

It seems that the "rock forging" laminated cylinder magic circle that the part-timers had been running around setting up to surround the campsite earlier was the "rock forging" laminated cylinder magic circle. The detonation switch in the teacher's hand is said to be the activation switch.

<blank>

So you can go ahead and go in peace."

Thank you, Alma. I hope Dr. Morris will not be too hard on himself."

<blank>

Alma said this to me as she blew the chips away one after the other.

I thanked him and told Dr. Morris to take it easy.

The two men laughed and sent me off, saying, "Go ahead.

<blank>

I immediately start running from there. I already have all my gear on. My destination is the nature park at the foot of the Rohan volcano, where I was until this morning.

We just have to return to the "outdoor class" location as fast as we can.

We probably don't have much time. But I will make it happen.

<blank>

That's right! Let's use that thing we improved while consulting with Dr. Seiwashi.

Let's go beyond the sound barrier this time.
