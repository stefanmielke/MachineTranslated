# Episode 40: A Bouquet for Lavinia Cloud

The conclusion is finally at hand.

<b>

<b>

Just a little bit... just a tiny bit more to add... (^▽^;)

----------------

<b>

"Why?! Lord Orbet?!"

"What the hell?! What’s going on?! Ahab! What happened?!"

<b>

Ahab, along with the five vampires—Putora, Laila, Barney, and Lawrence—became agitated.

As if a shocking event had occurred, they began to stir in confusion.

And the front lines started to falter.

<b>

"Calm down, you guys! Lord Orbet is safe!"

"Ahab! I'm going!"

<b>

<b>

As the sun dipped below the horizon and the night began to fall, the vampires overflowed with their minions from the shadows.

The servants of those with white skin.

Night is the time when vampires can fully exert their power.

Even if they are lowly servants, their strength should not be underestimated.

<b>

The five vampires left the fighting to their minions and began to withdraw from the front lines one after another.

<b>

However, one of them was blocked by Rider Haggard.

<b>

"Where do you think you're going, vampire? I'm your opponent."

"Get out of the way! I don't have time to deal with you!!"

"Then try to make me move!?"

"You! Don't get cocky, human!!"

<b>

Blocked by Rider, the vampire named Lawrence transformed his hand into a vicious claw and thrust it toward Rider.

Rider deflected it with his knight sword.

<b>

"Hmph, a mere human!"

<b>

Lawrence smirked, and his body blurred.

In an instant, he disappeared from that spot and appeared behind Rider.

<b>

"Too slow! You sluggish human!!"

<b>

He lunged forward, aiming his claws at Rider's heart.

But Rider, still facing away, twisted the knight sword behind him over his shoulder and caught the claw.

<b>

"You vampires are always together. Just 'fast.' And you lack finesse in what you do."

"W-What did you say!?"

<b>

Lawrence's eyes widened.

Rider, while lifting the claw with the knight sword, turned to face him and swiftly slashed off Lawrence's arm from the elbow down with a sword enveloped in golden holy energy.

Lawrence instinctively jumped back, but the severed arm spun in the air before falling.

<b>

"Ugh! What is this pain?! Gahhh!!"

"You vampires can regenerate your bodies like lizards no matter how much you injure them. So...!"

<b>

Rider pierced the falling Lawrence's arm with the knight sword from below and infused it with concentrated golden holy energy.

Lawrence's arm exploded into particles of light and dissolved into the atmosphere.

<b>

"That's why I will infuse it with holy energy and obliterate your very soul!"

<b>

Rider swung down the knight sword vigorously and declared loudly.

<b>

"You! You! You!!!"

<b>

As he shouted, Lawrence's appearance began to change.

His mouth split open, his face became flat, and his nose elongated.

His eyes turned entirely blue and began to emit a dull light.

His fingers transformed into sharper claws, and his legs morphed into those of a beast.

He took on the form of a bipedal reptile.

<b>

"You've become more like a vampire!"

<b>

Rider charged at Lawrence, his eyes filled with golden light.

Multiple small magic circles appeared in front of Lawrence.

From them, ice pillars the size of a human arm emerged and were shot toward Rider one after another.

Rider dodged them, slashing with his right-hand sword, shattering with his left fist, and dispelling them with an open palm as he closed in on the grotesque creature.

Lawrence swung his left claw down at Rider, who had entered his range.

Rider dodged it, but Lawrence aimed a kick with his right claw at Rider's face.

However, Lawrence was also dodged, and Rider attached himself to Lawrence's right side.

Rider thrust the knight sword into Lawrence's side and drove it through to his heart.

<b>

"Gwaaaah!!!"

"It's over... vampire."

<b>

Rider quietly told the screaming and blood-spitting Lawrence, infusing the knight sword with golden holy energy.

The vampire was enveloped in light and exploded into particles, disappearing.

<b>

Rider quietly withdrew the knight sword he had plunged into the void and shook off the blood as if to clean it.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ahab! Lawrence isn't following us!"

"Leave him! Right now, Lord Orbet is our priority!"

"Over there, he's heading toward the ghouls that Lord Orbet sent out."

"Go after them!"

<b>

The four vampires raced silently through the forest.

Leading the way, Ahab commanded the shadow ghouls lurking in their shadows.

<b>

From their shadows, several masses overflowed and stretched upward, disappearing into the depths of the forest through the trees.

<b>

"I will never forgive them! I will absolutely tear them apart!"

"What are they? Lord Orbet seems to be safe for now."

<b>

Suddenly, a shockwave spread through the forest.

At the same time, the vampires felt that all the shadow ghouls had vanished.

<b>

"Huh? What the?!"

"N-No way!!"

"Ahh!!"

<b>

Three vampires exploded one after another.

<b>

"Laila?! Barney?! Putora?! What on earth…"

<b>

The elder vampire known as Ahab

saw the last thing he would witness: a fluttering light green skirt and a silver blade rushing toward him.

The vampire who had existed for over 200 years turned into white particles and melted into the atmosphere in the next moment.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

A thunderous sound echoed above the forest.

And in an instant, a massive pillar of fire vanished.

Many who had been engaged in battle on the front lines heard that sound and witnessed the fire pillar.

<b>

"Chief! What was that sound?!!"

<b>

Marcel Avance, cutting down lesser vampires with wind blades, turned to Howard Cloud in a panic and asked.

<b>

"Hmph... that rascal."

<b>

Howard, also cleaving lesser vampires with his zweihander, muttered with a surprisingly pleased smile.

<b>

<b>

The servants left behind by the vampires, the white-skinned lesser vampires.

Even if they are considered lowly servants, they are originally powerful monsters.

For the lower and middle-tier members, it was too much to handle.

They had to focus on defense to prevent them from breaking through the defense line, while Howard and the higher-ranking members dealt with the extermination.

But there were simply too many of them.

The number of servants summoned by a single vampire was 13 to 15, totaling over 70.

Although Howard and the others were cutting them down one after another, their numbers still hadn't dropped below 50.

<b>

<b>

"Cloud-san!"

<b>

Rider, while slaying lesser vampires, approached Howard.

The lesser vampires, known as "Golden Bloodsucker," were easily turned to dust by Rider's sword.

<b>

"Rider, have you cleared your regrets?"

"Yes, one for sure. The rest..."

"…I see. …Hmm!?"

<b>

At that moment, both of them sensed a dreadful presence approaching them.

<b>

"Chief! Th-this is!!"

"Don't make a fuss!!"

<b>

Marcel called out to Howard in a fluster.

<b>

This foul presence was familiar.

It was something they had just faced and could not forget.

And it was rapidly closing in on them.

<b>

What flew in from the sky, tracing an arc, crashed into the ground with force, creating a hole and rolling, eventually stopping right in front of Howard and the others.

<b>

It then grabbed the ground with both hands, rose its dirt-covered body, and began to spew curses.

<b>

"You! I will not forgive you!! I will not forgive that redhead!!! I will kill you! I will tear you apart! I don't need your blood anymore! I will rip off your fingers one by one and slowly tear you apart! That girl!! I will make her realize who she has trampled on! Scream and suffer to death! Drown in your own blood while regretting it! Hahaha! Hyahhahaha!!!"

<b>

Orbet Mash let out a distorted laugh from his grotesquely twisted mouth.

<b>

"Have you changed quite a bit in the short time I've been away? Child Eater?"

"What?! You! Why are you here?!!"

"Pathetic Child Eater. You wouldn't want to keep exposing yourself like that, would you? Out of pity, I will now guide you to your end with my own hands!!"

<b>

"Ugh! You old man...! Enough! No more holding back! I will use everything to trample you all!!"

<b>

With that, Orbet ripped the blue star beads from his chest and crushed them in his mouth.

He also tore off many star beads that he wore around his neck and gathered them in his hands.

<b>

"I will use all my collection! You will pay the appropriate price!!"

<b>

Orbet crushed the star beads one after another.

A torrent of magical power and souls swirled and rampaged within his body.

Breathing heavily, he forcefully swallowed the swirling magical power, and Orbet's body began to change rapidly.

His flesh bubbled up as if foaming, filling in the lost lower half and forming the missing parts.

Soon, his limbs were covered in powerful muscles, and vicious sharp claws dug into the earth.

His nose elongated, and sharp fangs crowded his wide-open mouth.

His entire body became covered in large, rough scales, murky like stagnant blood.

A thick, long tail whipped the ground, creating heavy thudding sounds that shook the area.

<b>

Orbet let out a rumbling growl like an earthquake.

His form, exceeding 5 meters in length, resembled a massive crocodile with a long neck and distorted bat wings.

<b>

Still bubbling and frothing, Orbet raised his head high and roared like thunder, suddenly lunging at the lesser vampires around him.

With his massive jaws, he bit down on two or three prey at once, crushing and swallowing them.

After devouring several lesser vampires in quick succession, Orbet's body finally settled down.

He growled lowly and fiercely, glaring at Howard.

<b>

"Prepare yourselves! You will all be slaughtered! Adults and children alike! I will kill every last villager! I will feast on them myself! Die with honor!"

<b>

"Try if you can! Child Eater!!!"

<b>

Howard readied his zweihander, its magical power glowing brightly.

<b>

With a roar, Orbet surged forward, undulating his massive body with surprising speed toward Howard.

<b>

Orbet opened his mouth wide, aiming to bite Howard head-on.

However, just before the fangs could reach him, Howard pulled back his right foot and dodged the attack.

He then planted his foot on the ground, gathering strength, and explosively slashed upward with the zweihander.

<b>

"Ughhhh!!!"

<b>

The sword strike, released with a fierce shout, sent Orbet's jaw flying upward.

<b>

"Gu-puh?!"

<b>

Orbet's head was thrown back.

For a moment, his eyes rolled back, but he quickly seemed to realize something and spun his massive body to retreat.

In the next instant, a blue sword flash sliced through the spot where Orbet's throat had been exposed.

The zweihander cut through the air as Howard spun around on the spot.

<b>

"Hmph, I intended to slice off your snout... but it seems I lacked the power. However, even with your larger size, your escape is still as swift as ever, Child Eater!?"

<b>

"Shut up, old man!"

<b>

Orbet turned away from Howard and began to run.

<b>

"I don't need to deal with you first!"

<b>

Orbet directed his snout toward the area where the lower-tier members were gathered.

<b>

"You! Are you running away again?!!"

<b>

Howard began to chase after Orbet.

Seeing this, Orbet smirked.

He twisted his body as if to turn around and swung his thick tail toward Howard's side.

Howard was sent flying, crashing through wooden barricades and trees, landing deep in the forest.

<b>

"Chief!!"

<b>

Gary Myers couldn't help but shout.

Orbet looked at the destroyed barricade, twisting his mouth in a grimace.

But in that instant, a sword flash gleamed at Orbet's snout.

A knight sword enveloped in golden holy energy left a deep gash on Orbet's nose.

Orbet screamed and recoiled.

<b>

"Do you have the luxury to look away, Child Eater?"

<b>

Rider Haggard, swirling the knight sword, maintained a cautious distance from Orbet while keeping a sharp gaze on him.

<b>

"Curse you all!! Every last one of you!!"

<b>

Orbet ground his teeth in frustration, his claws digging into the ground.

<b>

"You have no room for error! Did you think Cloud-san would be defeated by that?!"

<b>

"Honestly, to fall for such an obvious trick... I will surely be scolded by Suzy to keep it together."

<b>

Howard emerged from the debris of the barricade he had shattered.

He placed his right hand on the back of his neck and cracked it.

Returning to the square, he swung the zweihander wide to loosen his shoulders and then swiftly unleashed blue sword flashes in all directions.

<b>

"Are we done with our warm-ups? Child Eater?"

<b>

"Shut up! You old bastard!!!"

<b>

Orbet let out a roar, and magical power began to gather and shine at his forehead.

The mass of magical power surged into a torrent, beginning to shoot in all directions around Orbet.

Howard and the others instinctively dodged the magical lines, but some members were unable to evade, and parts of their equipment were scorched and blown away.

The magical lines that reached the ground released compressed energy, causing explosions in the vicinity.

<b>

"Hyahhahaha! Die! Die! Die!!!"

<b>

Orbet fired magical lines repeatedly.

The area was engulfed in explosions and flames, and amidst it all, his insane laughter echoed.

<b>

"You Child Eater!! Rider!!!"

"Yes!!"

<b>

Howard exchanged eye contact with Rider and began to run toward Orbet.

Seeing this, Orbet concentrated his magical power and fired it at Howard.

<b>

"Be obliterated, old man!!!"

<b>

Howard's equipment shone brightly, and the blue light surrounding the zweihander intensified.

<b>

"Ughhh!!"

<b>

Howard faced the incoming magical lines with determination, channeling all his strength into a powerful upward slash with the zweihander, deflecting the beam of light.

<b>

"What?! Impossible?!!"

<b>

Surprised that his magical line had been deflected by a sword strike, Orbet widened his reptilian eyes in shock.

Seizing the moment, the knight sword pierced into the center of his forehead.

Rider clung to Orbet's head, plunging the knight sword deep, enveloped in golden holy energy.

<b>

Orbet let out a scream of agony, shaking his head to throw Rider off while rising on his hind legs.

<b>

In that exposed moment, Howard leaped in.

In an instant, the massive sword slashed through the air with a fierce shout, slicing through Orbet's torso.

The slash cleaved Orbet’s body in two.

<b>

The strike cleaved Orbet's body from his left abdomen to the root of his right front leg, and slowly, his massive form began to slide down, crashing to the ground with a tremor.

As his giant body began to dissolve like when he absorbed magical power, it bubbled and melted away.

Eventually, only the white, emaciated upper body of a child remained at the scene.

<b>

"Impossible... why... why... am I... like this..."

<b>

Orbet murmured in disbelief, steam rising from his entire body as he struggled to comprehend the situation.

<b>

"This is the end, Child Eater..."

<b>

Howard approached Orbet, who was writhing on the ground, and quietly declared.

<b>

"...Rider. You finish this."

"What?! Cloud-san?!"

<b>

Howard, with a calm expression, looked down at Orbet and instructed Rider to deliver the final blow.

<b>

"This... this should be done by you, Cloud-san! I... I could only help up to this point...!"

"Don't push the elderly too hard... I have nearly exhausted my power with that last attack! I don't have the strength left to eliminate him now. You do it, Rider. And move forward! You must finish this with your own hands!"

"…Cloud-san…"

<b>

Howard nodded firmly while looking into Rider's eyes.

Rider stepped forward, readjusting the knight sword in his hand to a reverse grip.

He began to gather golden holy energy, infusing it densely.

And then, right at Orbet, who was still writhing at his feet...

<b>

"This is the end, Child Eater. Disappear! Forever!!"

<b>

With that, he plunged the shining golden knight sword into Orbet's forehead.

Orbet's body shattered and dissolved into particles of light, vanishing into the atmosphere.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

**************************************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"……Orbet has disappeared."

<b>

In a dim room, amidst a long, quiet silence, a man murmured softly.

<b>

It was a small room.

In the light of a small oil lamp, several shadows flickered and swayed in the darkness.

The shadow that had just spoken leaned back comfortably in a large, heavy chair.

<b>

His body was dark-skinned, with long, straight black hair cascading over the back of the chair and flowing down behind the seat.

He wore only a waist cloth with a front flap, leaving his upper body bare.

Around his neck was a wide necklace crafted from gold and silver, golden bracelets adorned his arms, and a thin silver crown rested on his forehead, each reflecting the lamp's light faintly in the dark.

And more than that, two sharp, cold eyes emitted a bright glow.

<b>

The person at the end of those sharp gazes wore a thick black robe, with only his mouth visible beneath the hood, but it was clear that he was a man not yet in his middle age.

He responded to the previous murmur.

<b>

"…Is that so? It seems he was not strong enough after all."

"Hmm... Rodolf Darker. You used Orbet, didn't you?"

"……………"

"You used Orbet as a measuring stick, didn't you?"

<b>

A woman who had been standing behind Rodolf stepped forward and interjected in a flustered manner.

<b>

"Forgive me, my lord! Rodolf-sama holds no ill will against you!!! Rodolf-sama is…!!"

"Enough, Clarimond. I am not blaming your master."

"Indeed, the extent of his power in Tribune's village was uncertain. The skills of the skilled ones in that village are extraordinary. However... this was faster than I had imagined..."

"…What do you think, Abdo?"

<b>

The man on the throne posed a question to one of his attendants who stood nearby.

<b>

"Yes! Forgive me. That was due to his overconfidence; he likely became complacent and underestimated them."

<b>

The attendant named Abdo replied to the man's inquiry.

<b>

"Now, Rodolf? Did you wish to gauge the strength of those skilled ones?"

"The strength of his village is uncertain, after all..."

"Hmph, including the hero's power, 'uncertain'... is it?"

"…………"

"Is it surprising? Even I, though not as much as you, have my eyes and ears open."

"…You jest."

"Hmph, jesting... yes, this is jesting... heh heh."

"I knew that if it were the skilled ones of that village, even Orbet would be in danger... thus, I had prepared my moves..."

"Hmph, I said he 'disappeared,' didn't I? Orbet was obliterated."

"What?!"

<b>

Abdo exclaimed in surprise.

<b>

"True vampires like Orbet, even if their bodies are destroyed, will eventually revive. However, if their existence is obliterated, they cannot come back. He was erased along with his soul."

"To have such power...?"

"Do the skilled ones of the village possess such power?"

"…………"

"Is it the 'hero' who has manifested after 200 years? How delightful. Isn't it, Rodolf?"

<b>

The man on the throne chuckled quietly.

Abdo's eyes widened at the mention of the 'hero.'

<b>

"Have we made any moves regarding the Fire Temple? Water has been found by Hazod. Leave that to Luar."

<b>

Everyone placed their hands on their chests and bowed their heads in a show of loyalty.

<b>

"Rodolf. You may act as you wish. Gather your strength for that time. And do not forget to entertain me."

"「「「「Yes!」」」」"

"After I awaken from my slumber, for the ceremony to celebrate my pure priestess and her holy grail, make sure to add some flourish."

<b>

"Yes! As you wish, Lord Alz Aluf, the King of Beginnings."

<b>

The man named Rodolf, cloaked in robes, knelt and bowed his head.

Following suit, the woman named Clarimond did the same.

Those who had been surrounding the throne also followed suit.

<b>

The cheerful chuckle of Alz Aluf echoed softly in the dim room.

<b>

<b>

<b>

**************************************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When Suzy arrived, there were still a few white vampires remaining.

She observed from a distance as three low-tier members held back four lesser vampires with their shields.

<b>

Suzy kicked off the ground from behind the three, spun in the air, and slashed down with her dual swords, cutting the vampires to pieces.

She exploded the vampires and landed smoothly.

<b>

The three, witnessing the fragments of the vanishing vampires before them, exclaimed in awe.

Confirming that the three were safe, Suzy hurried to Howard.

<b>

"Howard-san! Howard-san!!"

<b>

Suzy joyfully called out as she approached Howard.

<b>

"Howard-san!! Thank you for the wonderful sword!"

<b>

When she reached Howard, Suzy beamed a smile and expressed her gratitude for the sword.

<b>

"Oh! Suzy! You've returned?! How is it? How does the sword feel to use?"

"Yes! It's very, very easy to use! And... I'm so happy for your feelings, Howard-san!!"

<b>

For a moment, she looked down shyly but quickly lifted her face, gazing straight up at Howard as she spoke.

Howard nodded repeatedly, smiling broadly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Gary Myers slayed the last lesser vampire, turning it to dust.

Seeing this, Rufino sat down as if exhausted.

Next to him, Randolph leaned against his tower shield, panting heavily.

<b>

"It seems it's over..."

"Yeah... I can't stand anymore!"

"Me neither... But... that was Suzy Cloud who just came, right...?"

"That's right... That's her... impressive, isn't it?"

"…Impressive... hey, Kenneth?"

"What is it, Rufino?"

"………How can I get a membership card?"

"Rufino?! Are you serious?!!"

"I'm serious, Randolph. I'm serious."

"Our fan club welcomes anyone who understands her greatness."

"………Is it okay for my... share?"

"No problem, Randolph! Just let me know anytime!"

<b>

It seems two new membership cards will be issued.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It seems it's over..."

<b>

Howard murmured as he watched the last dust of the vampire disappear.

<b>

"The school is already being cleaned up."

<b>

Suzy said, gazing toward the village.

<b>

"Did you take care of it?"

"Yes, everyone is safe. Everyone is doing well!"

<b>

Suzy replied with a smile.

At her words, Marcel Avance let out a sigh of relief, "Ahh!" and sat down.

Gary Myers patted Marcel's shoulder, nodding, sharing in the joy of their ally's relief.

<b>

"Our home is safe... oh! Sonia Mama is preparing herb chicken for us! Let's hurry home, Howard-san!!"

<b>

Suzy clapped her hands together as if realizing something and excitedly urged Howard to hurry home.

<b>

"Wait, Suzy? Did you just call Sonia 'Mama'?"

"…Ah."

<b>

Howard and Suzy exchanged glances for a moment.

<b>

"Um... well, how should I put it... I... um, how about...?"

"Eh? ...Ah, um... H-Hawad... P-uh... um..."

<b>

Howard scratched his cheek, looking embarrassed while urging Suzy with his eyes to continue.

Suzy's eyes darted around, and her face turned bright red.

<b>

"H-Hawad-san! H-Hawad-san!!"

<b>

She couldn't help but shout.

<b>

"S-Suzy...?"

<b>

Howard's face turned slightly desperate.

Rider, who was watching from the side, burst out laughing.

<b>

"C-Chief?! Bwahaha!"

"R-Rider? Y-You?!"

<b>

Howard looked at Rider with an awkward expression, seemingly forgetting he was there.

Rider had completely relaxed, no longer resembling the man who had just fought fiercely.

He no longer resembled the fierce warrior who had just been in a deadly battle. The “Iron Demon” from earlier now looked like a simple, good-natured old man.

Rider laughed heartily.

Howard scratched his cheek even more awkwardly.

Seeing this, Suzy pouted at Rider, wondering why he was laughing at Howard.

Rider, with tears in his eyes, bowed his head apologetically to Suzy.

<b>

"Howard... I will head back home first after school, okay?"

<b>

"You still have some cleanup to do, right?" Suzy said, turning back to Howard, straightening her posture.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work."

<b>

She bowed deeply.

Rider's eyes widened at Suzy's demeanor.

<b>

"Yes, Suzy, you did well."

"No! Everyone did their best!"

<b>

Suzy beamed at Howard.

Then she turned to Rider, tilting her head slightly, and offered him a bright smile, expressing her gratitude.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work! Rider-san!"

"Thank you for your hard work! Rider!"

<b>

In Rider's widened eyes, Suzy's figure overlapped with Lavinia's smile.

Just like Lavinia always did, tilting her head and spreading her smile.

<b>

"…Ah! …L-Lav..."

<b>

A rush of warmth surged within Rider's heart.

Suzy then told Howard to come back quickly and ran off toward the school.

<b>

"Yeah... yeah, Lavinia... yeah."

<b>

Rider watched Suzy leave, but her figure became distorted and hard to see.

<b>

Howard stood next to Rider, pulling him close and gently patting him on the shoulder.

"Tomorrow, I will bring flowers. I must report to Lavinia..."

"Yes... yes!"

<b>

Rider continued to shed large tears.
