# 40 Episode Flowers for Lavinia Cloud

Finally, the decision is made.

<blank>

<blank>

Just a little ......, just a little bit more ......(^▽^;)


----------------

<blank>

Why? Lady Orbette!

What? What do you mean? Ahab! What's going on?

<blank>

The five vampires, including Ahab, Putola, Lila, Barney, and Lawrence, were colorful.

Suddenly, as if a startling event has occurred, they begin to rustle and shake with obvious agitation.

Then the battle lines began to be disrupted.

<blank>

Calm down, boys! Lady Orbet is safe!"

Ahab! I'm going!"

<blank>

<blank>

As soon as the top of the sun's head sank to the horizon and the nighttime curtains began to fall, the vampires were flooding the area from their shadows, their dependents.

Servant of the white-skinned guys.

Night is the time when vampires can wield their full power.

We cannot underestimate the power of these people, even if they are low-class servants.

<blank>

The five vampires left their servants to deal with Howard and the others, while they themselves left the front one by one.

<blank>

However, Rider Haggard stands in front of one of them.

<blank>

Where are you going, vampire? I'm the one you're dealing with."

I don't have time for you! I don't have time for you!

Then why don't you just let them retreat!"

You! Don't be a figurehead! You human!

<blank>

The vampire called Lawrence, who was blocked by the rider, transformed his hand into a vicious claw and thrust it toward the rider.

The rider plays it off with his nightsword.

<blank>

"Hmph, you human wanker!"

<blank>

Lawrence grins and his body blurs.

It disappeared from the scene, and the next moment it appeared behind the rider.

<blank>

It's too late! You slow, slow, slow human!"

<blank>

He thrust his claws vigorously toward the rider's heart.

But the rider, with his back turned to him, turned his nightsword over his shoulder to the back and caught the claw.

<blank>

You're always together, vampire. You're just fast. And you're not very good at what you do."

What the hell?

<blank>

Lawrence peels his eyes away.

The rider turned to face the front, winding up the claws with his nightsword, and quickly slashed Lawrence from elbow to elbow with his sword, which was covered with golden holiness, as if he was going to slash him up.

Lawrence jumped backward as quickly as he could, but the slashed arm was dancing in the air above him, spinning around and around.

<blank>

What is this pain? What is this pain? Aaagh!

You vampires, no matter how much damage you do to your bodies, will soon regenerate like lizards. So...!"

<blank>

The rider pierced Lawrence's falling arm from below with his nightsword and struck him with concentrated golden holy chi.

Lawrence's arm explodes into particles of light and dissolves into the atmosphere.

<blank>

"So I'm going to cage the holy chi in this way and extinguish the whole soul!"

<blank>

The rider swung down his nightsword vigorously and declared loudly.

<blank>

O-No-Ore! Onoree! Onoree!

<blank>

Lawrence's aspect changes as he screams.

The mouth is cleft, the face is flattened, and the nasal surface is elongated.

The eyes became entirely bluish and began to glow with a dull light.

The claws of the limbs turn into sharper claws, and the legs turn into those of the beast.

It is a bipedal reptilian figure.

<blank>

You're starting to look the part, vampire!"

<blank>

The rider charged toward Lawrence with a golden light in his eyes.

A number of small magic circles appeared in front of Lawrence.

From there, icicles the size of a human arm appear and shoot out one after another at the riders.

The rider ducks it, slashes away with his right sword, smashes it with his left fist, and proceeds to strike it out with his open palm in front, entering the bosom of the deformed one.

Lawrence launched a left claw down at the rider in time.

The rider ducks, but Lawrence kicks him in the face with his right claw.

Lawrence, however, was also evaded and was attached to the right side by the rider.

The rider thrust his nightsword into Lawrence's side on the spot, and then went straight through to the heart.

<blank>



It's over... vampire.

<blank>

As Lawrence screamed and spat out blood, the rider quietly told him and poured golden holy chi into his nightsword.

The vampire is enveloped in light, bursts into flames, and disappears as particles.

<blank>

The rider quietly pulled back his nightsword, which he had thrust into the void, and swung it away as if to dispel the drawn blood.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ahab! Lawrence isn't following me!"

Leave her alone, Putra! Let Lady Orbet go first!

There they are, right where Master Orbet's ghouls are headed.

You guys head over there!

<blank>

The four vampires were running soundlessly through the forest.

Ahab, in the lead, flew orders to the shadow gurus lurking in their shadows.

<blank>

Several lumps of water overflow from their shadows and disappear deep into the forest, passing through the trees.

<blank>

I'll never forgive you! I'll rip you to pieces for sure!"

Who the hell are you? It seems that Lady Orbet is still alive."

<blank>

Suddenly, a shockwave spread through the forest.

At the same time, the vampires sensed that all the shadow ghouls had disappeared.

<blank>

What? Why ebohyuu!"

Nah, gopayabo!

Akyup!"

<blank>

The three vampires fly into the air one after another.

<blank>

Lila? Barney? Putola? What the..."

<blank>

Elder vampire called Ahab.

The last thing he saw was a fluttering young grass-colored skirt and a silvery white blade looming in front of him.

The vampire, which had existed for over 200 years, next dissolved into the atmosphere as white particles.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A roar rang out over the forest.

And a huge pillar of fire that disappeared in an instant.

Many of those on the front lines participating in the battle heard the sound and saw the pillars of fire.

<blank>

Goto head! What is that sound?

<blank>

Marcel Avans slaughtered a lesser vampire with a blade of wind and turned to Howard Cloud in a panic and asked him.

<blank>

"Huh... that Yanka."

<blank>

Howard's mouth was still open and he muttered happily as he used his Zweihender to cut the Lesser Vampire in two.

<blank>

<blank>

Their servants left behind by vampires, the Lesser Vampires in white.

To them, we may be lowly servants, but we are inherently powerful demons.

The load is too heavy for the low and middle group members.

They were kept on the defensive so that they would not be able to break through the defensive battle, and Howard and his higher-ranking staff were in charge of exterminating them.

But there are too many of them.

The number of servants invoked by one vampire ranged from 13 to 15, and the total number of servants exceeded 70.

Although Howard and his men were cutting them down one by one, the number was still less than 50.

<blank>

<blank>

Mr. Cloud!"

<blank>

A rider came toward Howard, slaughtering a lesser vampire.

Cut down by the sword of the rider known as the "Golden Vampire Slayer" on the western frontier, the lesser vampire is easily reduced to dust.

<blank>

"Rider, have you been cleared of your regrets?"

Yes, one indeed. The rest..."

"...I see. ...Mm!"

<blank>

At that time, they both sensed a fearless presence approaching them at the same time.

<blank>

Goto head! This, this!

Don't make a fuss!

<blank>

Marcel called out to Howard in a panicked tone.

<blank>

I remember this filth-like presence.

It is an unforgettable object that I confronted just a few minutes ago.

It is rapidly approaching us.

<blank>

It arced out of the sky, hit the earth with all its momentum, gouged a hole, rolled, and eventually came to a stop right in front of Howard and the others.

<blank>

Sole eventually gripped the ground with both hands, raised her earth-covered body, and began to spit out curses.

<blank>

I'll never forgive you! I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you, that redhead! I'll kill you! I'll rip you to pieces and kill you! I don't need your blood anymore! I'll tear off your fingers and toes one by one, and then I'll tear you to pieces! That girl! I'll make you realize who you've kicked in the foot! I'll make you cry out and die in agony! Drown in your own blood with regret! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

Orbet Mash's ugly, twisted mouth emitted a distorted laugh.

<blank>

I'm sure I've looked a lot like you in the little time I've been away, haven't I?" Childeater?"

What? You! What are you doing here?

You look pathetic, Childeater. You don't want to stay like that forever, do you? As a small measure of compassion, I'm going to give you up now with my own hands!

<blank>

Damn it! You old man...! That's enough! No more sparing! I'm gonna use it all up and lay waste to you all!

<blank>

Orbet then plucked a blue star bead from his chest, put it in his mouth, and chewed on it.

He also ripped off a number of star beads, which he wore around his neck like a necklace, and placed them in his hand.

<blank>

I'm going to use my entire collection! And you will pay for it!

<blank>

Orbet chewed one star bead after another in his grip.

A torrent of magical power and souls swirls and rages through the body.

Breathing hard, he forcefully swallowed down the opposing magic, and Orbet's body rapidly began to change.

The flesh rises like a bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling, bubbling.

Soon its limbs were covered in strong muscles and thickened, and its viciously sharp claws gripped the ground.

The snout is elongated and the wide-open mouth is rife with sharp fangs.

The whole body was covered with large, rough scales, muddy and reddish-black like stagnant blood.

Its long, thick tail whips the earth, and a heavy thud shakes the area.

<blank>

Orbet let out a rumbling, earth-shaking roar.

More than five meters long, it looks like a giant crocodile with a long neck and distorted bat wings.

<blank>

Orbette, her body still bubbling, raised her head above the ground and let out a thunderous roar, and suddenly she was bitten by the lesser vampires around her.

With their huge jaws, they chew and swallow two or three prey at a time.

After having been eaten by more than a dozen lesser vampires in quick succession, the changes in Orbet's body finally calmed down.

Then he glugged and gave a low, ferocious snarl and glared at Howard.

<blank>

Prepare yourselves! You are all dead! All of you, adults and children! I'll kill them all! Every last one of you, every single villager, I'm going to eat you up myself and feed you to me! Die with honor!

<blank>

If you can do it, do it! Childy-iitaaaaaaahhhhh!"

<blank>

Howard held up his Zweihender, his equipment shining through the magic.

<blank>

Orbet howled a single cry, his whole body rippling from side to side as he closed in on Howard at a speed that did not match his huge body, closing the gap at once.

<blank>

Orbet opens his mouth to bite it head on and challenges Howard.

But just before the fangs reached him, Howard pulled his right leg and removed himself from the line of fire.

The Zweighender, which had been on the ground and building up its strength, was slashed with explosive force from below.

<blank>

Nuh-uh!!!!"

<blank>

The sword strike, fired with spirit, bounced Orbet's jaw upward with a powerful sound of a blow.

<blank>

"Gup...?

<blank>

Orbet's head was bounced upward.

For a moment, Orbet's eyes flashed white, but then, as if immediately realizing something, he spun his huge body around and moved out of the way.

A moment later, a blue sword flash ran directly across the place where Orbet's throat had been exposed.

The Zweighender cuts through the air, and Howard spins on the spot with the same momentum.

<blank>

I was going to cut off his nose, but... not enough. But even though you've grown bigger, you're still just as fast on the run as ever, aren't you? Childeater!

<blank>

Let me out! Mentor!

<blank>

Orbet just turned away from Howard and ran.

<blank>

I don't have to deal with you first!

<blank>

Orbet turned his snout toward the place where the low-ranked gathered.

<blank>

"You son of a bitch! Running away again?

<blank>

Howard ran after Orbet.

Orbet sees this with a sideways glance, and his mouth is agape.

Orbette spun on the spot and slammed her thick tail into Howard's side.

Blown away, Howard was knocked into the woods, clearing log barriers and trees.

<blank>

Gokouzu!

<blank>

Gary Meyers couldn't resist shouting.

Orbet looked at the destroyed protective fence and twisted his mouth.

But a moment later, a sword flash flashed across Orbet's nose.

The nightsword, clad in golden sanctity, made a deep wound in the bridge of Orbet's nose.

Orbet screams and twists and retreats.

<blank>

'Can you afford to look the other way? Childeater?"

<blank>

Rider Haggard was turning his nightsword in a yurgling motion, keeping a sharp eye on Orbet while keeping a guarded distance between him and her.

<blank>

I'm not going to let them get away with it! Every one of them!

<blank>

Orbet gnashed his teeth with his fangs, which grew in a rough, gnashing manner, and thrust his claws into the ground.

<blank>

I already have no room for you! Did you really think that was going to get you, Mr. Cloud?"

<blank>

I can't believe I'm falling for such a trick...Suzy is going to scold me again for being so naive.

<blank>

Howard emerged from between the protective fences he had shattered with his own body.

Put your right hand on the back of your neck and turn your head with a coquelicot.

Returning to the plaza, he turned his Zweihender in a wide circle as if to unshackle the shoulder area, and then quickly flashed his blue sword in all directions.

<blank>

Are we done prepping each other?" Child Eaters?"

<blank>

'Fuck you, you old bastard! You old bastard!

<blank>

Orbet roars, and the magic converges in the area between the eyebrows, emitting a radiance.

The magic power that gained mass became a torrent and began to shoot around Orbet.

Howard and his teammates quickly ducked, but some of them were unable to do so, and the parts of their equipment that were snagged were blown away in a blaze of flame.

The magic ray that reached the ground released convergent compressed energy and launched a blast flame in the area as well.

<blank>

'Hyah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Die, die, die! Die, die, die!

<blank>

Orbet shoots out magic rays repeatedly.

The area is enveloped in explosions and flames, and a loud, crazy laugh echoes through the air.

<blank>

Childeater! Rider!

Yes!

<blank>

Howard exchanged eye contact with Ryder and started running toward Orbet.

Orbet, seeing this, concentrates his magical power toward Howard and fires.

<blank>

Wipe it out! Moldy!

<blank>

Howard's equipment shines brightly, and the blue light that Zweighender wears increases in intensity.

<blank>

Noooooooo!"

<blank>

Howard faced the magic ray that was closing in on him, and with all his might, along with his spirit, he slashed the Zweihender from below and flicked off the bundle of light.

<blank>

What? That's ridiculous!

<blank>

Surprised that his own magic ray had been repelled by the sword strike, Orbet's huge reptile-like eyes widened.

Taking advantage of this momentary gap, the nightsword bit into the area between its eyebrows.

The rider attached himself to its head and thrust his nightsword deep into it, imbued with golden sanctity.

<blank>

Orbet let out a scream of sudden intense pain and stood up on his hind legs, shaking his head to shake off the rider.

<blank>

In an instant, Howard jumped into that widened pocket.

A moment later, a powerful sword draws a blue sword flash with a split energy, and it flashes across Orbet's torso.

The sword strike had cut both sides of Orbet's body.

<blank>

Orbet's body was severed from his left abdomen to the base of his right foreleg, and his huge body slid down the slit and collapsed with a tremor on the ground.

The flesh of his huge body bubbles up like when he took in magic power, and this time it crumbles and melts away.

Soon, only the white, scrawny, childlike upper body remained in its place.

<blank>

"You idiot ......, ...... what is ........., ...this... ...I'm ......, I'm .................."

<blank>

Orbet is blowing smoke like white vapor rising from his entire body, muttering without strength and unable to comprehend the current situation.

<blank>

This is the last one, Childeater. ......

<blank>

Walking up to the side of Orbette, who was writhing on the ground, Howard quietly announced.

<blank>

"...... Rider. You finish it."

What? Mr. Cloud? !"

<blank>

Howard looks down at Orbet with a quiet face and tells him to put a stop to the riders.

<blank>

"This ...... this guy should do it, Mr. Cloud! I'm ...... only able to help you this far ......!"

Don't push the old man too hard... I've used up most of my strength! I've used up most of my strength! I don't have enough power left to kill him now. You do it, Ryder. And go on! You finish it yourself!"

"...... Mr. Cloud ........."

<blank>

Howard looked Ryder in the eye and nodded vigorously.

The rider stepped forward and re-holstered the nightsword in his hand in the opposite hand.

The golden holy chi is then kneaded into the air and caged in a dense atmosphere.

And just like that, to the orbette still writhing at my feet....

<blank>

It's over, Childeater. It's over, Childeater! Forever!

<blank>

With that, he thrust a golden nightsword between Orbet's eyes.

Orbet's body shattered, dissolving into particles of light and disappearing into the atmosphere.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

**************************************************

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

............ Orbet is gone."

<blank>

In the dimness of the room, in the long, silent silence, the man muttered quietly.

<blank>

It was a small room.

With only a small oil lamp as a light source, several figures floated and swayed like shadows in the darkness.

The figure that had just uttered a murmur is leaning back in a large, massive chair as if relaxed.

<blank>

His body was sallow black, and his long, straight black hair hung down the back of the chair and cascaded down the back of the seat.

The only thing she wears is a loin cloth with a droop in front, leaving the skin of her upper body exposed.

Around her neck was a broad necklace of gold and silver, around her arms were golden bracelets, and on her forehead was a thin silver crown, each shining faintly in the darkness, reflecting the light of the lamp.

And two sharp, cold eyes that shine even brighter than that.

<blank>

The man in front of the sharp eyes wears a thick black robe and a hood that reveals only his mouth, which belongs to a man who has not yet reached the prime of his life.

The man responded to the earlier murmur.

<blank>

I am not sure if it is ....... After all, he is not strong enough.

"Hmmm, ...... Rodolphe Darker. You used Orbet, didn't you?"

"..............."

"They must have used Orbet as a measuring stick, right?"

<blank>

At the question of the man sitting on the throne one step higher, the woman behind the man called Rodolphe stepped forward and interrupted him as if in a hurry.

<blank>

I am afraid, Mylord! Master Rodolphe is in no way against Mylord! Master Rodolphe is ......!

Good Clarimonde, I do not blame you. I do not blame your Lord.

It is true that we did not know how well his power would work in the village of Tribune. The ability of the skilled people in that village is extraordinary. But ...... this happened more quickly than I had imagined.

"...... What do you think, Abdo?"

<blank>

The man on the throne asked a question to one of those who were waiting around him.

<blank>

I'm afraid." With all due respect, sir. I think it is the result of his being a good-natured person, being overprepared and underprepared, and underestimating his power.

<blank>

A follower called Abd answers the man's question back.

<blank>

"Hey, Rodolphe? Did you want to measure the skill of these skilled men?"

The strength of his village is unknown to us. ......

"Hm, 'unknowns' ......, including the power of the brave?"

"............"

"Why am I not surprised? I may not have your eyes and ears, but I have your eyes and ears.

"...... have fun."

"Hmmm, a play. ...... yes, this is a play. ...... hmmm."

"I knew that with all the skill in that village, even Lord Orbet was in danger,......, but I had been working on it,.......

"Hm, I said 'disappeared,' didn't I? Orbet was made to cease to exist.

What? What?

<blank>

A follower, called Abd, voiced his surprise.

<blank>

Orbette, the True Vampire, will be resurrected one day, even if she is destroyed. But she can't come back if she's been erased from existence. The soul of Orbette has been erased from existence.

"With ...... that much power."

"Do the village's skilled workers have that much power?"

"............"

The "first 'hero' to manifest in 200 years?" Isn't this something to look forward to? Right, Rodolphe? Rodolphe."

<blank>

The man on the throne chuckles quietly.

A follower called Abdo opened his eyes at the words of the 'brave'.

<blank>

'Can't you get around to the Temple of Fire? Hazod found the water. Let Luar take care of that.

<blank>

They all put their hands on their chests and bowed their heads in reverence.

<blank>

Rodolphe. Move as thou wilt. Save your strength for the moment. And remember to entertain me at all costs, will you?"

「「「「 haha! 」」」」

"Let me add a little more splendor to the celebration of my unholy priestess and her chalice, where my slumber has opened up."

<blank>

"Ha! As the King of the Beginning, Ars Alf, wills."

<blank>

The robed man called Rodolph dropped to one knee and hung his head.

And the woman called Clarimonde followed suit.

The men surrounding the throne followed suit.

<blank>

A chuckle of amusement from Ars Alf echoed softly through the dimly lit room.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

**************************************************

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When Suzy arrived, there were still some white vampires left.

Suzy was watching from far back where the three low-ranked group was holding back four lesser vampires with their shields.

<blank>

Suzy kicked the ground behind the three, spun around in mid-air, and with her head down, swung her two swords and slashed wildly at the vampire.

Suzy blasts away at the vampire and lands on her feet.

<blank>

When the three of them saw the vampire pieces vanishing before their eyes, they exclaimed, "Wow!　they exclaimed in amazement.

After confirming with a sideways glance that the three were safe, Susie rushed straight to Howard's side.

<blank>

Mr. Howard! Mr. Howard!

<blank>

Suzy, who had identified Howard, squealed with delight and rushed over to Howard.

<blank>

Howard! Thank you, thank you, thank you, for the beautiful sword!"

<blank>

When she comes to Howard's doorstep, Suzy smiles a spilling smile and goes to thank him for the sword.

<blank>

Oh! Suzy! You're back, aren't you? How do you like it? How does it feel to use that sword?

Yes, it's very, very easy to use! It's very, very easy to use! And...I'm so happy that Howard is so nice to me!"

<blank>

Susie looked down for a moment, but immediately raised her head and looked straight up at Howard.

Howard nodded his head repeatedly, his face breaking into a smile.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Gary Meyers slaughters the last of the Lesser Vampires and leaves them in the dust.

Ruffino, who was watching, sat down on the spot as if he had run out of patience.

Next to him, Randolph also leaned his body against the tower shield and breathed on his shoulder.

<blank>

"Oh, looks like it's over..."

Oh ......, I can't get up now!"

I can't either...I can't ...... but ...... I just got here...Suzy Cloud?

Yes... she's Suzy. ...... isn't she awesome?"

...... awesome,...hey, Kenneth?"

What is it? Ruffino."

"......... how do I get a... membership card?"

Ruffino! Are you serious?

I'm serious, Randolph. I'm serious."

Our fan club welcomes anyone who understands how wonderful she is."

"......... for my... stuff, okay?"

No problem, Randolph! You can tell me anytime!"

<blank>

It appears that two new membership cards will be issued.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Looks like it's over..."

<blank>

Howard muttered as he watched the last of the vampire dust disappear.

<blank>

Schools have been cleaned up.

<blank>

Suzy said as she looked out into the village.

<blank>

"So Suzy went to you?"

Yes, everyone is fine. Everyone is fine!

<blank>

Suzy smiled and answered.

At those words, Marcel Avans ahhed!　and sat there with a sigh of relief.

Gary Meyers patted Marcel on the shoulder and nodded, sharing his friend's joy as he patted his chest.

<blank>

The house is safe and sound.......! Sonia-mama has prepared a herb bird for us! Let's go home soon! Mr. Howard!

<blank>

Yes, I know! Suzy clapped her hands in front of her chest as if to say, "Yes!

<blank>

Wait a minute, Susie? Did you just call Sonia 'mom'?"

Ah.

<blank>

Howard and Suzy look at each other for a while.

<blank>

"That ...... mmm, what can I say... I'm ...... mmm, well, I don't know ......? I'm .........."

What? ... ah, uh... ah, ha, hawad... pah... ah, uh, ・・・・・・"

<blank>

Howard scratches his cheek and looks embarrassed, but his eyes are urging Suzy to say something first, as if he's begging her.

Suzy's eyes were swimming and her face was turning red.

<blank>

Howard!" Mr. Howard!

<blank>

I yelled.

<blank>

"Su, Suzy ......?"

<blank>

Howard's face took on a look of mild despair.

The rider who was watching the scene beside me blew up.

<blank>

"Goh, go-head? Boo-hoo!

"La, rider? Oh, you!

<blank>

Howard looks at Ryder with an embarrassed look on his face. Apparently, he had forgotten he was there.

The rider had completely relaxed his shoulders.

It is hard to believe that this is the man who had been fighting to the death. The "Iron God" who was there just a few minutes ago has now become just a good-natured old man.

Ryder laughed aloud.

Howard scratches his cheek even more uncomfortably.

Suzy, who was watching the scene, asked Ryder, "Why are you laughing at Howard? She protested to Ryder, "Why are you laughing at Howard?

With tears in his eyes, Ryder apologized and bowed to Susie.

<blank>

"Howard, I'm going to school and then I'm going home, okay? I'm going to school and then I'm going to go back to the house, okay?"

<blank>

You still have some cleanup to do, don't you?　After saying this, Susie turned to Howard and straightened her appearance once again.

<blank>

Thank you for your service."

<blank>

and bow deeply.

The rider was blindsided by the sight of Suzy.

<blank>

Mm, Susie did a great job."

No, it's because of everyone's hard work! It's because you all worked so hard!"

<blank>

Suzy turns her spilling smile to Howard.

He immediately turned to the rider, tilted his head, smiled as best he could, and said, "You, too, Mr. Ryder.

<blank>

Thank you for your service! Mr. Ryder!"

'Thanks for your efforts! Rider!

<blank>

The rider's eyes, wide open, reflected Ravi's smile, superimposed on Suzy's image.

I saw Ravi tilting his head and smiling, just like he always did.

<blank>

"...... Ah! ......... Ah, la..."

<blank>

A hot feeling rose up in the rider's chest at once.

Susie told Howard to come home as soon as possible and ran off to school.

<blank>

"Yeah ...... yeah, Ravi ...... yeah."

<blank>

The rider looks away from Susie, but her back is distorted and she cannot see well.

<blank>

Howard stands beside Ryder, hugs him and gently taps him on the shoulder.

'I'll bring flowers tomorrow. I'll have to report back to Ravi. ......"

Yes. ......... Yes!"

<blank>

The rider just kept spilling large tears forever.
