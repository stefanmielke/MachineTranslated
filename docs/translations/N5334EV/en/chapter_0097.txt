# 85 - The Dormitory Supervisor at the Women's Dormitory

When Colin and AnnaMarie came to get their school ID cards, they asked me what was going on and what was going on. I just told them that 'evil has come to an end.

They looked at Irving, who was holding his face and pulling away, and he looked as if he had understood them.

<blank>

Make sure you get rid of those bruises on your face, okay?"

<blank>

When Colin muttered this in Bibi's ear, Bibi sighed loudly and said, "I have no choice!ã€€He sighed loudly as if to say, "I can't help it!

Yes, it's true! That one (Irving) is under Bibi's jurisdiction! I really wish he'd put a noose around his neck! But that's not possible, that's what bothers me!

<blank>

We were told that our luggage would be taken to our rooms later if we left it at the guard's office after being unloaded from the carriage.

The guard gave me an entrance pass, which I hung around my neck, and Colin led me through the gate, where I found a row of deep green trees.

It looked like a very well-kept park.

The path, paved with red bricks, curves gently through the trees to the rear of the property.

<blank>

Unlike the stony streets of the city, Coco is filled with the smell of earth and greenery, which is somehow relaxing.

It is long past tea time, but the summer sun is still strong.

Walking along the shaded paths, the gentle breeze also carries the whispers of the trees amidst the echoes of the cicadas' chirps.

Is the tree shading the side of the road a dogwood? I believe it had white flowers when I came to take the test.

The trunk of the tree, with its finely cracked bark, has grown thick, and its spreading branches and thick foliage cast gentle shadows over us.

I'm walking with a big bag, but the breeze blowing gently in the shade of this tree is very comfortable.

<blank>

<blank>

Colin led the way through the shaded path for a while, and in the distance, among the trees, an orange roof was glimpsed between the fresh greenery.

Maybe that's the school building.

<blank>

That orange gable roof was steeply pitched, and the ivory plastered building was, as I recall, three stories high.

I took my exams in that building and I remember it was a very beautiful building.

<blank>

Looking at the building on the left, I went further along the forest road to go around it and saw another building behind the trees.

The building is surrounded by a fence, even though it is on school grounds.

The fence, however, was not a majestic iron fence like the ones that surrounded the school, but a wooden one with planks on wooden stakes, the kind you would see in an ordinary house site.

In addition, inside the fence, there is a hedge with a golden osmanthus planted, so although we could not see the entire building, we could see from a distance that it was a building with white walls.

<blank>

Eventually, the wooden fence was stopped by white posts and an entrance to the built-up site appeared.

The entrance is only that pillar painted white, with no gate.

Beyond the entrance was a square-like space paved with white stones.

Inside the circular white cobblestone pavement is a lush lawn surrounded by flower beds, and furthermore, a cool fountain rises in the center of the lawn.

And in that white square, there are still white benches, a large parasol, a round table, and a few chairs surrounding it.

Several tables were lined up inside a cute white-walled building at the edge of the plaza, where people were drinking tea inside.

What is this? Is this a fancy open-air cafe? It's on school grounds, why is there something like this?

<blank>

While we were amazed at the space in front of us, Colin was moving forward in the plaza.

People sit sparsely on benches and tables on the terrace.

On one of the benches there, a cool breeze was swaying in the cool air, shaded by the branches of a large, overgrown tree.

The person sitting on the bench noticed immediately when Colin approached, closed the book he was reading, lifted his glasses with the middle finger of his right hand, turned his head toward us and opened his mouth.

<blank>

"Hey, you're a lot later than you were supposed to be. What's up?"

<blank>

It was someone we knew well. He was Willie Hodgson, one year above us, in the same grade as Colin and the others.

Willie questioned me like that as he stood up. It looks like we've been waiting here for a very long time.

I am sure that the news of what happened in Palouse did not reach Willie.

<blank>

Ask them both later for the details, Willie. Now we need to get everyone to the dorms. You take them to the men's dorm as planned.

Hm, okay, I see what you mean. Well then, Irving, let's go to Lombard. "Well, Irving, let's go to Lombard. Tell me some more stories later.

<blank>

Willie patted Irving and Ron on the shoulder and smiled at us.

Hm, I wonder if Willie's good-looking coefficient has gone up after not seeing him for a while?

<blank>

Well, to look at him for a moment, he's a fresh-looking glasses guy, so I think he might be popular with girls. ......

<blank>

But we know that he is a muthafucka on the inside!

The fact that I used to try to see the contents of my rolled-up skirt with other boys is not something that will ever go away, though!

It is stored securely in my memory storage box and can be retrieved at any time, just like a freshly picked vegetable, with all its freshness.

In my mind, Willie is still registered as Mr. Muttsuri!

Willie, unaware of my inner assessment, shook his head lightly to remove the bangs from his glasses, lifted them up again, smiled at me and waved his hand in a handsome gesture, then led us on our way. He then led them on their way down the road.

<blank>

Shall we go, too?

<blank>

After seeing the three of us off, Colin again led us in the opposite direction from where Willie and the others had gone.

Immediately, a building that I had just seen from outside the fence appeared. It looked like an apartment building with white walls.

This is the dormitory where we will be living.

<blank>

Anyway, I passed several students on the way here, and each time I said hello to Colin, saying, "How do you do, Mr. Saunders?

Colin responded with a friendly hello.

Is it the default at school to exchange greetings when passing each other? It seems like a more ladylike school than I imagined. ......

Or is Colin a celebrity in the school? Everyone has been calling him by his name properly. ......

<blank>

While I was thinking about this, Colin opened the large double doors in the center of the building and invited us into the dormitory.

The entrance hall of the dormitory was very spacious with a stairwell to the second floor, and sunlight shining through the stained glass windows colored the floor with sparkles.

There was a large staircase in front of the building, and from the landing, the stairs split off to the left and right, leading directly to the second floor. On the landing, a large long case clock looked down on us, and the whole floor was filled with the sound of the slow ticking of time.

<blank>

What is this? Seriously, I'm getting the feeling that we've come to a place that is out of touch with the common people. Am I going to be okay? Am I?

While we were gulping at the majesty of the entrance hall, Colin was knocking on the large, strict-looking door adjacent to the hall.

<blank>

Mrs. Sheldon. I'm here to show the new students around."

Thank you for your time, Miss Saunders. Thank you, I will take you the rest of the way, you may rest now."

<blank>

The lady who came out of that door was slender, slender, and very well-postured.

Her gray hair was pulled back in a tight bun and pinned on top of her head, and square glasses sat on her high nose. She was about one year younger than Mama Sonia and Ms. Elrose, I guess. But I could tell from her appearance that she has a different kind of sternness from Elrose's.

After exchanging a few words with Colin, he looked at us and we all stood up straight.

<blank>

May I ask your name?"

Yes, yes, I am Suzy Cloud! Susie Cloud, sir!"

My name is Beatrice Croquis!

Mia Mathisun, sir!

<blank>

He asked me my name right in front of him, and I just stood erect and answered!

The tension in this person's eyes is unbearable!

<blank>

I have checked ....... Welcome to our traditional Milia Castel Eye boarding school girls' dormitory. My name is Sheldon, and I am the dorm supervisor for the girls' dormitory. For the next three years, I ask that you all live a life of moderation befitting a student of our school."

<blank>

When I looked through the documents in the binder in my hand and confirmed our names, the dormitory supervisor said so with a straight posture and without moving an inch.

I don't know, but I was really nervous. The three of us gulped down a mouthful of saliva!

<blank>

"...... and Miss Byros. Is it you, ............?"

It's been a while, Mrs. Sheldon. I'm glad to hear you're doing well."

"You look the same ......, though I'm afraid you must look a little different, Miss Byros."

I'm not worried, Mrs. Sheldon. The Annemarie Bairos will never disappoint you."

I'm sure you can do the job with confidence. ......Yes, I can certainly entrust you with the job with peace of mind,...... but please don't ever, ever, ever cause any problems. Yo, Miss Byros."

"I know exactly what you mean, Mrs. Sheldon."

<blank>

A conversation that I don't understand was going on between Mrs. Sheldon, the dorm supervisor ......, and AnnaMarie.

Finally, Mrs. Sheldon, who put her hand lightly on her forehead and shook her head as if to say, "No, thank you very much.

<blank>

I wonder. I knew AnnaMarie was a graduate of this school, but I didn't realize she was also acquainted with this dormitory supervisor. Well, that's not surprising!

I thought you knew that AnnaMarie was going to take a job in this dormitory, so was that just a precautionary measure?

Still, compared to the old AnnaMarie, she still seemed to be worried about something. ...... I wonder if AnnaMarie used to be a bit of a rascal in this school. ............?

<blank>

When I glanced at AnnaMarie, she noticed my gaze and gave me a soft smile.

<blank>

I have to go to the dormitory office now, Miss. I will be leaving you for a short while, but I will be back as soon as I finish the paperwork. Your daughter's luggage will arrive shortly, and then we will put your luggage away. I know you must be feeling a little alone, but please wait here for a moment, okay?"

<blank>

Immediately, AnnaMarie took my hand and said to me in a very worried tone.

It's kind of like the attitude of a young child who is afraid to be left alone.

I felt my cheeks heat up a little at the thought of being treated like that in front of someone I had never met before.

Am I really that unreliable? I don't think I look that young anymore. I'm in high school, after all!

Yes! I am a high school girl! I am!

It's JK, right?

J.K.!

<blank>

I'll be fine! Don't worry! AnnaMary, please take care of your own business first!"

"Oh, miss ............?"

<blank>

I was embarrassed by AnnaMarie's overprotective attitude, and in a rather pouty manner, I made a little bit of a rebuffing remark.

But AnnaMarie takes my attitude and breaks down as she looks at me, still holding my hand.

<blank>

"Oh, but, it would be ...... nice if you could hurry up and come ...... quickly."

Oh! Miss! Awe, my lady! I'll be right with you!"

<blank>

I look into AnnaMarie's moistened eyes and withdraw my little tsuppari!

I am ashamed of my sulky attitude over a trivial matter, but I am relieved to see AnnaMarie's happy face.

<blank>

Miss! Wait a moment, My Lady! I'll be right with you, miss!

<blank>

AnnaMarie said happily as she rattled off her large trunk and went off at a terrific pace down the hallway.

<blank>

"Walk more quietly, Miss Byros!"

<blank>

Mrs. Sheldon shouts sharply to AnnaMarie as she moves away, but AnnaMarie has already turned the corner of the hallway and is nowhere to be seen.

Mrs. Sheldon put her hand to her head and sighed, oh dear.

<blank>

Now, we can't leave you here forever. For now, let me show you to your rooms. Please follow me."

<blank>

Mrs. Sheldon, seemingly regaining her composure, led us to our respective rooms in the back of the dormitory.

<blank>

The dormitory will be a double room for first and second year students, and they will be given private rooms from the third year.

In the hallway, Mrs. Sheldon gave us our keys and told us our room assignments. The three of us were assigned to different rooms.

<blank>

While listening to the explanation of the room assignment, Mia was muttering "Sue and another room, Sue and another room, Sue and another room, Sue and another room ............" in a small voice like an incantation while sinking her teeth into her thumb. It was a little bit scary. ......

But I was secretly nervous that Mia would make a fuss about it, asking Mrs. Sheldon to change the room, but I was relieved to see that she didn't.

Well, I will say that Mia was sensible enough!

I don't know how I could take a bite out of ......, or Mrs. Sheldon, for that matter!

<blank>

I wish I could be in the same room with Mia, but it's not like I can ask her every time I want to.

I heard that Bibi and Mia's room has already been occupied by the girl who will be my roommate, but the girl who will be my roommate has not yet arrived at the school.

<blank>

Then, in the hallway, Mrs. Sheldon handed us the key, looked at us with the key in her hand, and said, "I'm sorry.

<blank>

Now, go to your rooms. This is your home from now on."

<blank>

It was a quiet and very gentle voice.
