# Episode 85: The Dormitory Supervisor

Colin and Annemarie, who had come with their admission certificates, were making quite a fuss, so I asked what was wrong. I simply told them, "The demon has been vanquished."

The two of them looked at Irvin, who was trembling while holding his face, and their expressions seemed to say they understood, so I think they got it.

<b>

"Make sure to get rid of that bruise on your face, okay?"

<b>

When Colin whispered this into Bibi's ear, Bibi let out a big sigh as if to say, "What can you do?"

That's right! That (Irvin) is under Bibi's jurisdiction! Ideally, I would want him to be tied up, but it's troubling that I can't do that!!

<b>

<b>

Our luggage, which was taken down from the carriage, could be left at the guard's office, and it would be delivered to our respective rooms later, so we just took our hand luggage and asked the guard to help us proceed through the campus with the larger items.

We received our admission certificates from the guard, hung them around our necks, and followed Colin through the gate, where lush green trees lined the path.

It looked like a well-maintained park.

The path, paved with red bricks, curved gently between the trees and continued deeper into the grounds.

<b>

Unlike the city with its stone smell, this place was filled with the scent of earth and greenery, which was quite soothing.

Although tea time had long passed, the summer sun was still strong.

As we walked along the shaded path, the sound of cicadas echoed, and a gentle breeze carried the whispers of the trees.

The trees creating shade by the roadside were probably dogwoods? I think they were blooming with white flowers when I came to take the exam.

The trunk, which looked like it had fine cracks, grew thick, and the leaves spreading from the branches gently cast shadows over us.

Even though I was walking with a large bag, the breeze rustling through the shade felt very pleasant.

<b>

<b>

As we followed Colin along the shaded path for a while, I spotted an orange roof peeking through the new green among the distant trees.

That must be the school building.

<b>

The orange gabled roof was steep, and the building painted with ivory plaster was three stories high.

I remember taking the exam inside that very building, and it was a beautiful structure.

<b>

As I passed the building on my left and continued along the forest path, another building appeared deeper among the trees.

Even though it was on school grounds, that building was surrounded by a fence.

However, the fence was not the majestic iron type that surrounded the school but rather a simple wooden one made of planks nailed to wooden posts, like those seen around ordinary houses.

Moreover, inside the fence were planted osmanthus trees, forming a hedge, so the entire building was not visible, but I could tell from afar that it was a white-walled structure.

<b>

Eventually, the wooden fence was stopped by white pillars, revealing an entrance to the area where the building stood.

The entrance had no gate, just the white-painted pillars.

Beyond that entrance was a space resembling a plaza, paved with white stones.

Inside the circular white stone pavement was a lawn surrounded by flowerbeds, and in the center, a refreshing fountain was rising.

And in that white plaza, there were also white benches, large umbrellas, round tables, and several chairs surrounding them.

Inside the cute white-walled building at the edge of the plaza, there were several tables lined up, and I could see people enjoying tea inside.

What is this? Is this a chic open café?! Why is there such a thing on school grounds?!!

<b>

While we were surprised by the space in front of us, Colin continued to move deeper into the plaza.

There were a few people sparsely seated at the terrace benches and tables.

One of the benches had a large tree branch creating shade, and a cool breeze was swaying gently.

As Colin approached, a person sitting on that bench immediately noticed him, closed the book he was reading, adjusted his glasses with his right hand's middle finger, and looked up to speak to us.

<b>

"Hey, you were quite late. Did something happen?"

<b>

That was someone we all knew well. It was Willy Hodgson, a year above us and in the same grade as Colin.

Willy stood up and voiced his question, indicating he had been waiting there for quite a while.

Surely, the news about the incident in Palus hadn't reached Willy yet.

<b>

"I'll tell you the details later, Willy. For now, we need to take everyone to the dormitory. Please take the two of them to the boys' dorm as planned."

"Hmm, got it. Then, Irvin, let's go to Lombard. It's been a while, Mia, Suzy, Bibi. Tell me all about it later."

<b>

After patting Irvin and Ron on the shoulders, Willy smiled at us.

Hmm, it seems Willy's attractiveness has increased a bit since I last saw him?

<b>

Well, at first glance, he looks like a refreshing glasses guy, so he probably has a decent female fanbase...

<b>

But we know that he's actually quite reserved!

The fact that he once tried to peek under my skirt with other boys is something that will never disappear!!

That memory is firmly stored in my mind, and I can recall it at any time, as fresh as just-picked vegetables.

In my mind, Willy is still registered as a reserved guy!

Unaware of my inner evaluation, Willy lightly shook his head to brush away his bangs and adjusted his glasses again, smiling at us and giving a light wave before leading the two of them down the path.

<b>

"Shall we go as well?"

<b>

After seeing the three off, Colin once again led us, this time in the opposite direction of where Willy had gone.

Soon, the building we had seen from outside the fence appeared. It looked like a white-walled apartment building.

This was the dormitory where we would be living from now on.

<b>

By the way, along the way, I passed a few students, and each time they greeted Colin with "Good day, Mr. Saunders."

Colin returned their greetings with "Good day."

Is it customary to exchange greetings when passing by at school? This place feels more like an elite girls' school than I imagined...

Or is Colin a celebrity within the school? Everyone is calling him by name...

<b>

While I was pondering this, Colin opened the large double doors in the center of the building and invited us inside the dormitory.

The entrance hall of the dormitory was very spacious, with a high ceiling up to the second floor, and the sunlight streaming in through the stained glass created a sparkling pattern on the floor.

In front of us was a large staircase, and from the landing, the stairs split to the left and right, continuing up to the second floor. A large longcase clock looked down at us from the landing, echoing the sound of time ticking slowly throughout the floor.

<b>

What is this? I seriously feel like I've come to a place far removed from the common folk? Am I going to be okay?!!

As we were taken aback by the grandeur of the entrance hall, Colin knocked on a large, stern-looking door adjacent to the hall.

<b>

"Mrs. Sheldon, I have brought the new students."

"Thank you, Miss Saunders. You may rest now; I will take it from here."

<b>

The person who came out from that door was a slender, tall lady with excellent posture.

Her gray hair was neatly tied up, and she wore square glasses perched on her high nose. She seemed to be a bit younger than Sonia Mama and Mrs. Elrose, but she had a different kind of strictness about her that was evident from her demeanor.

After exchanging words with Colin, she turned her gaze toward us, and everyone instinctively straightened their backs.

<b>

"May I have your names?"

"Y-yes! Suzy Cloud!"

"I am Beatrice Crook!"

"I-I am Mia Matheson!!"

<b>

Faced with the question of our names, we stood at attention and answered!

This lady's intensity and the tension in the air are overwhelming!!

<b>

"…I have confirmed. Welcome to our prestigious Millia Castle Eye Girls' Dormitory. I am Sheldon, the dormitory supervisor. For the next three years, I ask that you lead a life befitting the students of this academy."

<b>

After checking the documents in the binder she held, the dormitory supervisor spoke with a straight posture without moving a muscle.

What is this? The tension is incredible. We three couldn't help but swallow hard!

<b>

"…And, Miss Vylos. Is that you…?"

"Long time no see, Mrs. Sheldon. I’m glad to see you well."

"You too seem unchanged… well, I hope you have changed a little, Miss Vylos."

"Rest assured, Mrs. Sheldon. This Annemarie Vylos will not disappoint your expectations."

"Is that so?… Yes, indeed, I can trust you with my work, but… please, please ensure that no problems arise, Miss Vylos."

"I understand perfectly, Mrs. Sheldon."

<b>

An unfamiliar conversation unfolded between the dormitory supervisor… Mrs. Sheldon and Annemarie.

In the end, Mrs. Sheldon lightly placed her hand on her forehead and shook her head slightly as if to say no, and concluded the conversation with, "That's enough; in any case, please take care of things."

<b>

What’s going on? I knew Annemarie was an alumna of this school, but she was also acquainted with this dormitory supervisor. Well, that makes sense!

Since Annemarie was supposed to be working in this dormitory, was that a kind of prior warning?

Even so, it seemed like she was still worried about something compared to her past self… Did Annemarie get into trouble at this school before…?

<b>

When I glanced at Annemarie, thinking about this, she noticed my gaze and returned it with a soft smile.

<b>

"Young ladies, I must head to the dormitory office for a moment. It will be a brief farewell, but I will come as soon as I finish the paperwork. Your luggage should arrive shortly, so once it does, we can unpack it together. I know you might feel lonely alone, but please wait just a little while, okay?"

<b>

Immediately, Annemarie took my hand and said this with a very worried tone.

It felt like she was treating me as if I were a young child left alone.

I could feel my cheeks heating up a bit at being treated like that in front of someone I had just met.

Am I really that unreliable? I don't think I look that young! After all, I'm in high school now!

Yes! I'm a high school girl!

I'm a JK!!

J・K！！

<b>

"I'm fine! Don't worry! Annemarie, please take care of your work first!"

"W-What, young lady…?"

<b>

Embarrassed by Annemarie's overprotective attitude, I ended up responding a bit defiantly.

However, Annemarie, upon receiving my attitude, held my hand and her expression softened.

<b>

"B-but, it would help if you could come quickly… I would be happy if you could hurry…"

"Ah! Young lady! Understood, young lady! I will take care of it right away!"

<b>

Seeing Annemarie's eyes glisten, I quickly retracted my little defiance!

Feeling ashamed for having acted a bit sulky over something trivial, I was relieved to see Annemarie's happy face.

<b>

"Young lady! Please wait a moment! I will be right there, young lady!!"

<b>

With a cheerful tone, Annemarie dragged her large trunk and hurried down the hallway.

<b>

"Please walk more quietly, Miss Vylos!"

<b>

As Annemarie walked away, Mrs. Sheldon called out sharply, but Annemarie had already turned the corner and was out of sight.

Mrs. Sheldon placed her hand on her head and sighed in exasperation.

<b>

"Now, I can't keep you all here forever. For now, I will show you to your rooms. Please follow me."

<b>

Regaining her composure, Mrs. Sheldon said this and guided us to our respective rooms in the back of the dormitory.

<b>

The first-year and second-year students share rooms, while third-year students are given individual rooms.

In the hallway, Mrs. Sheldon handed us the keys and explained the room assignments. The three of us were assigned to different rooms.

While listening to the room assignment explanation, Mia was muttering "Separate room from Su-chan, separate room from Su-chan, separate room from Su-chan..." while digging her thumb into her mouth, which was a bit scary...

However, I was relieved that Mia didn't start causing a fuss asking Mrs. Sheldon for a room change.

Well, it seems Mia has enough sense!

…Not that I could imagine anyone being able to confront Mrs. Sheldon!

<b>

If possible, I would have liked to be in the same room as Mia, but it's not like they could accommodate our preferences.

I heard that the girls who would be sharing rooms with Bibi and Mia had already moved in, but it seemed that the girl who would be sharing a room with me had not yet arrived at the academy.

<b>

After handing us the keys in the hallway, Mrs. Sheldon looked at us holding the keys and said,

<b>

"Now, please enter your respective rooms. This will be your home from today."

<b>

Her voice was calm and very gentle.

I will continue to update little by little.

I would be happy if you could wait patiently (>_<)

The fact that I've come this far is thanks to all of you who have bookmarked, evaluated, and read my work.

Thank you!!

I will continue to work steadily!

I look forward to your continued supportーー！！<(_ _)>
