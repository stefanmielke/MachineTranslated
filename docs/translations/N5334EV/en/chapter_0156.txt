# 144 Annie's Promise

Happy New Year!

This is the first drop of the year.

We look forward to working with you again this year!

Last night Annie was told by her father, Philip, "I'm done working. There is no need to go to the diner tomorrow.

Of course Annie couldn't swallow such words, "I don't agree! The work is not done yet! She retorts, "I'm not convinced!

However, Philippe assured him, "The child's work is done. From here on, it's the job of adults.

<blank>

Parents and children say, "I'll go!" No need!" After repeated arguments, the father and son finally unleash the family's most treasured sword: "I hate your father! Finally, the family's most treasured sword, "I hate my father," explodes.

<blank>

It was Philip who suffered the major damage as a result, and that evening, with the comfort of his wife, he opened a bottle of his reserve and slurped it down. ......

However, Annie had no idea about such things.

<blank>

<blank>

Nevertheless, Annie was able to leave the mansion alone the next morning.

I was prepared to be stopped, but I was not surprised.

Sari says that both her father and mother went out last night and have not returned yet.

<blank>

I don't know what happened, but it was convenient for Annie. Thanks to her, I can go to the facility where the twins are without hesitation.

When I told Sari that I was going to visit a friend, she was happy and ready to go.

<blank>

Sari's father may have told her not to let Annie go to work, but he doesn't think Sari is cholo, etc., because it is true that Annie goes to her friends. Maybe.

<blank>

He then puts away the chocolate wafers that Sari prepared for him as a souvenir in his pochette.

I love these crispy wafers covered in chocolate.

The crunchy texture and sweetness of the chocolate fills one's mouth, and one often gets scolded by one's mother for eating too much of this snack.

But both Sis Colin and Sis Suzy said they loved it. I am sure Dan and Nan and the children at the facility would love it.

When I imagine this, I am filled with the desire to deliver this as soon as possible.

<blank>

Besides, yesterday, Annie, who couldn't bear to see Cordelia in a depressed mood, had made a promise to her as well.

<blank>

I think Karen is having a hard time dealing with the suddenness of the situation. Why don't you come back tomorrow morning?

I'm planning to come by tomorrow to see how Dan and Nan are doing. Would you like to join me then?

<blank>

Cordelia's eyes welled up as she asked Annie if she could join her, but Lucille and Catherine pushed her away and took Annie's hand, saying, "We'd love to have you.

<blank>

Lucille and Catherine both compared her to the clunker they were serving and said, "What a neat girl for such a young age! "It's all the fault of Master Cloud's cousin!" They were sobbing with tears of joy and waving Annie's hand up and down again and again.

<blank>

I had such an exchange with Cordelia and her team yesterday.

So no matter what happened, Annie could not imagine not going today.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When Annie arrived at the facility, Cordelia and the others were still nowhere to be seen. The time was a little after seven o'clock.

The appointment was "in front of this facility around 8:00", so I had no choice but to come too early myself.

<blank>

Should I just wait for Cordelia for now? Or do we offer the children the snacks we brought earlier?

While Annie was going through these doubts, the entrance door was unexpectedly opened and Karen Merlin appeared from inside.

<blank>

Karen's eyes widened for a moment in surprise when she saw Annie standing in front of the door, but she immediately bent down slightly and opened her mouth as if she had just had an idea.

<blank>

You said, "Annie, you're ......, right? It's ...... at this early hour. Have you come to see Dan and Nan by any chance?"

<blank>

Karen makes eye contact with Annie and asks gently.

<blank>

Yes, I am Annie Cloud! I'm Annie Cloud. Good morning, Mr. Merlin."

'Phew, good morning. You can call me Karen. Oh, and I can call you Annie, too, if you'd like ......?"

Of course! Lady Karen!"

"Really? Thank you.

<blank>

Karen gently stroked Annie's head as she let out a "hmmm" laugh.

<blank>

Annie noticed that Karen made a much different impression on her than when she first met her at the tea house.

<blank>

At first, I thought she was very introverted, but now she is a bright and friendly sister, just like her sisters Colin and Susie.

<blank>

It makes sense that Dan and Nan always say that she is a "kind and proud sister".

I don't know why I got that impression at the time.

Now I thought his smile was very attractive.

<blank>

Dan! Nan! Annie's here!"

<blank>

As Karen raised her voice toward the inside of the facility, she heard two small footsteps approaching, pattering from inside.

<blank>

"...... Annie. Can I ask you a little favor?"

<blank>

Karen approached Annie, listening to the sound with a kind smile on her face.

<blank>

Can I help you?"

<blank>

The two caretakers haven't been back since last night. I'm very worried about them after what happened yesterday, but the guards told me they would have a secure facility for me after noon today. ......"

<blank>

Annie thought to herself as she listened to Karen, "Oh, this is your father's arrangement.

Last night my father repeatedly said about this facility that arrangements had been made and that there was no need to worry.

When Annie realized this, she felt proud and said, "That's my father! but at the same time, she also remembered that her father had unreasonably denied her attitude toward her work.

Then, a sense of frustration welled up from deep within my chest.

Now in Annie's heart, pride and abhorrence for her father are intricately intertwined and swirling violently.

<blank>

I am very grateful for the kindness of the Guard for such a small facility, but I think the little ones are very anxious. But I think the little ones are very anxious, so I'm going to stay here with them for the rest of the day. That's why I'm going to stay here with them for the rest of the day. But I have to work this morning, so I wanted to go to ...... to say no to the store. I'll be right back, so can I ask Coco to stay with me for the time being?"

<blank>

Of course, of course! Please go ahead and have a good time!

<blank>

Annie was about to get depressed, remembering the father-daughter fight, when Karen asked her about it, and she responded with a reflexive answer. Of course, she really wanted Karen to go without hesitation.

<blank>

I'll be back in less than half an hour! Thank God, I think I can be back in less than half an hour."

"Annie, girl!"

<blank>

Dan and Nan ran out of the facility and jumped on Annie.

Annie catches them both.

<blank>

Dan, Nan. I'm going to take your sister to the store for a little bit, and I was wondering if you and Annie could stay with me until then?"

With Annie? With your sister?

'Yeah, just for a little while. Are you okay? Can you do it?"

I'm going to entertain you, Annie! I'm gonna make Annie feel welcome! I'm gonna treat you!

Thank you, Dan and Nan. Please do."

Yes!"

Well then, Annie, I look forward to working with you."

Yes, sir! Welcome aboard!"

<blank>

The three of us lined up as it was and saw Karen off as she hurried to the "big vestibule".

<blank>

Well then, I've brought some more treats, so let's all eat inside!"

Silly? Yes!

<blank>

Just as Annie was about to take the twins' hands and go inside after seeing Karen off.

<blank>

Oh! Good morning! Good morning!

<blank>

Some of them came running into the place, gasping violently for breath.

Cordelia Casper.

Also coming along behind them are two of their attendants, Lucille Moore and Catherine Moore.

<blank>

The two attendants guided Cordilia along the way to make sure she did not get lost and to ensure her safety.

Also, she often crashes into walls while walking. This is especially noticeable when she is in a hurry.

The two continued to be very careful not to let such a situation arise, and a slight look of frustration was on their faces.

<blank>

Co-cha! Co-cha!

<blank>

The twins noticed Cordelia and immediately jumped on her.

<blank>

Abu! Ah, ah, oh, good morning. Dan, Nan."

Good morning! Koacha! Good morning, Co-tea! Good morning!

<blank>

Cordelia was almost knocked off balance by the force of the jump, and her legs became tangled. However, she managed to regain her balance and was able to return the morning greeting to the two men.

<blank>

Good morning. Miss Cordelia."

Good morning, Annie. Is, uh, Karen here ......?"

That's what I just passed by and went to ......

Yes, it is. ......'s?"

<blank>

Really, I was here just now, but we passed each other beautifully.

What can I say, I feel like I have witnessed the in-betweenness of this person.

Cordelia's expression fades as she watches.

<blank>

Ah! And, but...! You'll be back soon, why don't you wait inside?"

What?" I'm an outsider. I'm an outsider. Is ...... okay with you?"

No problem! No problem! Dan? Dan? Nan?

<blank>

I would love to have you!"

It helps."

<blank>

Lucille and Catherine answered Annie with vigor on behalf of Cordilia.

Annie involuntarily backs away from the momentum.

However, he quickly regained his composure and decided to ask them to enter the facility.

<blank>

Let's all go inside and wait for them. Dan, Nan, we'll be waiting for you at ......."

<blank>

<blank>

At ---- that moment, something intense gushed down Annie's spine. At the same time, her body stiffened and her face lost color.

Annie suddenly stopped moving. The people around her tilted their heads.

<blank>

<blank>

......I have never felt anything like this before. 

What the hell is this I'm feeling from the other side of this building? What the hell is out there?

<blank>

? Annie? Can I help you? ......?"

<blank>

When Annie did not move, Cordelia put her hand on her shoulder in disbelief.

But even Cordelia was at a loss for words when she saw Annie, who had lost her color and continued to sweat with her eyes wide open.

But Annie, as if determined, turned around to face Cordelia and the others and shouted.

<blank>

Ladies and gentlemen, let's get out of here as soon as possible! Let's get out of here as fast as we can!"

What are you saying?" Annie. You have children inside, don't you?"

<blank>

It was! We can't leave the kids inside!

However, it was impossible for me to get close to them in the midst of such an ominous atmosphere.

<blank>

And you have your guards here, don't you? If you need something, why don't you ask them?"

<blank>

Cordelia's words made me realize that there were guards standing around the facility as if they were protecting the building.

<blank>

One of the guards, noticing Annie's gaze, smiled and gave a good-natured smile.

The next moment, however, the guard was jumped by something huge and was blown straight to the side.

<blank>

!!!!"

<blank>

Everyone present was speechless.

After defeating the first guard, Sole leaped upon the second guard without a moment's pause, and in no time at all, he had neutralized all of the guards.

<blank>

"Ha-ha-ha! The guards are not as numerous as you think they are! Now we're out of the way?

<blank>

While Annie and the others were stunned, a man's voice, clad in malice, echoed around the area as if taunting them.

<blank>

Let's continue where we left off yesterday! Let's continue where we left off yesterday!
