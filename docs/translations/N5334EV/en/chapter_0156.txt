# Chapter 144: Annie's Promise

Happy New Year!

This is the first post of the year.

I look forward to your continued support this year!

Last night, Annie was unilaterally informed by her father, Philip, that "the work is done. There is no need to go to the cafeteria from tomorrow."

Naturally, Annie could not swallow such words and retorted, "I can't accept this!" "The work isn't finished yet!"

However, Philip declared, "A child's work is done. From here on, it's an adult's job."

<b>

After several rounds of back-and-forth between parent and child, with "I will go!" "No need!" being repeated, the ultimate weapon of "I hate you, Father!" was unleashed.

<b>

As a result, it was Philip who suffered significant damage, and that night he ended up opening a special bottle while receiving comfort from his wife.

However, such matters were entirely beyond Annie's concern.

<b>

<b>

Even so, Annie was able to leave the mansion alone the next morning.

She had braced herself for being stopped, but it was unexpectedly anticlimactic.

According to Sally, both her father and mother had left the night before and had not yet returned.

<b>

What had happened was unclear, but it was convenient for Annie. Thanks to this, she could go to the facility where the twins were without any reservations.

When she told Sally that she was going to play at a friend's house, Sally happily prepared to go out.

<b>

Sally might have been told by her father, "Don't let Annie go to work," but since it was true that Annie was going to a friend's house, she didn't think of Sally as naive. Probably.

<b>

Thus, she tucked the wafer chocolate that Sally had prepared for her as a souvenir into her pouch.

This snack, a crispy wafer wrapped in chocolate, was something she loved as well.

With its crunchy texture and the sweetness of chocolate spreading throughout her mouth, she often ended up eating too much and getting scolded by her mother.

However, both Sister Colin and Sister Suzy had said they liked it too. Surely, Dan, Nan, and the children at the facility would be delighted as well.

Imagining that scene, her desire to deliver this treat quickly overflowed.

<b>

Moreover, yesterday, seeing Cordelia downcast, Annie had made a promise with her.

<b>

"I think Lady Karen is quite flustered by the sudden events. How about coming again tomorrow morning?"

"I also plan to come tomorrow to see how Dan and Nan are doing. Would you like to join me then?"

<b>

To Annie's proposal, Cordelia, with teary eyes, timidly asked if she could join, but Lucille and Catherine pushed that aside, taking Annie's hand and saying, "We would love for you to join us."

<b>

Lucille and Catherine, comparing her to the incompetent ones they served, were moved to tears, saying, "What a dependable child for her age!" "As expected of Lady Cloud's cousin!" while shaking Annie's hand vigorously.

<b>

That exchange had taken place with Cordelia yesterday.

Therefore, no matter what happened, the option of not going today was simply unthinkable for Annie.

<b>

<b>

<b>

When Annie arrived at the facility, Cordelia and the others were still not in sight. It was just past 7 o'clock.

The promise was to meet "around 8 in front of this facility," so it was understandable that she had come too early.

<b>

For now, should she wait for Cordelia like this? Or should she go ahead and give the snacks she brought to the children?

As Annie pondered such things, the entrance door suddenly opened, and Karen Merlin appeared.

<b>

Karen was surprised to see Annie standing in front of the door, her eyes widening for a moment, but she quickly bent down slightly and opened her mouth as if she had just thought of something.

<b>

"Annie-chan... right? At such an early hour... Could it be that you came to see Dan and Nan?"

<b>

Karen met Annie's gaze and gently asked.

<b>

"Yes! I am Annie Cloud. Good morning, Lady Merlin."

"Fufu, good morning. You can just call me Karen. Oh, is it alright if I call you Annie-chan too?"

"Of course! Lady Karen!"

"Really? Thank you, I'm so happy."

<b>

Karen smiled and gently patted Annie's head.

<b>

Annie noticed that Karen's impression was quite different compared to when they first met at the tea house.

<b>

At that time, she thought she was a rather introverted person, but now she seemed bright and friendly, just like Sisters Colin and Suzy.

<b>

She could understand why Dan and Nan always said, "She's our kind and wonderful big sister."

She couldn't recall why she had such an impression back then.

Now, she thought that Karen had a very charming smile.

<b>

"Dan! Nan! Annie-chan has come to see you!"

<b>

When Karen called out toward the facility, she could hear the sound of small footsteps approaching quickly from inside.

<b>

"…Annie-chan. May I ask you for a favor?"

<b>

Listening to that sound with a gentle smile, Karen spoke to Annie.

<b>

"Is something the matter?"

<b>

"The two caretakers haven't returned since last night. I'm really worried about yesterday's events, but the guards said they would prepare a safe facility by this afternoon..."

<b>

As Annie listened to Karen's story, she thought, "Ah, this is arranged by my father."

Last night, her father had repeatedly said about this facility, "Arrangements have been made," and "There is no need to worry."

Realizing this, Annie felt a sense of pride in her father, but at the same time, she recalled how he had unreasonably denied her attitude toward her work.

Then, frustration began to boil up from deep within her.

At that moment, pride and resentment toward her father intertwined complexly in Annie's heart, swirling violently.

<b>

"It’s truly a blessing that the guards are so concerned about such a small facility. However, I think it must be very unsettling for the little ones. So, I plan to stay here with them today. But I have work to attend to from this morning, so I wanted to let the shop know... I’ll be back soon, so may I ask you to look after things here in the meantime?"

<b>

"Of course! Please go ahead without worrying!"

<b>

Remembering the fight with her father, Annie was about to feel gloomy when Karen's question snapped her back, and she reflexively answered. Of course, it was her genuine wish for Karen to go without any reservations.

<b>

"Really?! That’s a great help! I think I can return in less than 30 minutes."

"Annie-oneechan!"

<b>

Dan and Nan burst out from the facility and jumped onto Annie.

Annie caught the two of them.

<b>

"Dan, Nan. I'm just going to the shop for a little bit, so could you stay here with Annie-chan until then?"

"With Annie-oneechan?" "With oneechan?"

"Yes, just for a little while. Is that okay? Can you do it?"

"Yeah! I’ll take care of Annie-oneechan!" "I’ll take care of her!"

"Thank you, Dan, Nan. I’m counting on you."

"“Yeah!”"

"Then, Annie-chan, please take care of them."

"Yes! Have a good trip!"

<b>

The three of them lined up and hurriedly saw Karen off as she headed toward the "large front yard."

<b>

"Then, I brought some snacks, so let’s eat them together inside!"

"Snacks?!" "Yeah!!"

<b>

After seeing Karen off, just as Annie was about to take the twins' hands and enter, at that moment.

<b>

"Oh! Good morning!!"

<b>

Someone burst in, panting heavily.

It was Cordelia Casper.

Behind her were her two attendants, Lucille Moore and Catherine Moore.

<b>

The two attendants had guided Cordelia to ensure she wouldn’t get lost along the way, securing her safety.

Moreover, she often collided with walls while walking. This tendency became particularly noticeable when she was in a hurry.

The two continued to be mindful to avoid such situations, and a slight sense of urgency was visible on their faces.

<b>

"Ko-cha!" "Ko-cha!!"

<b>

The twins immediately jumped onto Cordelia as they noticed her.

<b>

"Ah! G-good morning. Dan, Nan."

"Good morning! Ko-cha!" "Ko-cha! Good morning!"

<b>

Cordelia, thrown off balance by the sudden embrace, almost stumbled. However, she managed to regain her posture and returned the morning greeting to the two.

<b>

"Good morning. Lady Cordelia."

"Good morning, Annie. Ah, um, is Karen here... perhaps?"

"Actually, she just left to go out..."

"Oh, I see..."

<b>

Indeed, they had just missed each other, even though Karen had been right there until a moment ago.

It felt as if she had witnessed this person's unfortunate timing firsthand.

Cordelia's expression visibly wilted.

<b>

"Oh! But! She will be back soon, so why don’t we wait inside?"

"Eh? W-would that be alright? I’m an outsider, you know..."

"Of course! No problem at all!! Right?! Dan?! Nan?!"

<b>

"Please do!"

"That would be a great help."

<b>

In place of Cordelia, Lucille and Catherine eagerly responded to Annie.

Startled by their enthusiasm, Annie instinctively took a step back.

But she quickly regained her composure and decided to let them in.

<b>

"Then everyone, let’s wait inside. Dan, Nan, I will guide everyone..."

<b>

<b>

――――At that moment, a powerful sensation surged down Annie's spine. Simultaneously, her body froze, and color drained from her face.

The others around her tilted their heads in confusion, wondering what was happening to the suddenly motionless Annie.

<b>

<b>

...She had never felt anything like this before. The threat she felt when facing the magical beasts in Amukam was not nearly as ominous as this.

What on earth was this sensation coming from beyond the building? What could possibly be there?

<b>

"Annie? What’s wrong...?"

<b>

As Cordelia placed a hand on Annie's shoulder, sensing her stillness, she too lost her words upon seeing Annie’s pale face and wide eyes, dripping with sweat.

However, Annie, as if steeling herself, turned to Cordelia and the others and raised her voice.

<b>

"Everyone! We need to leave here quickly!"

"What are you talking about, Annie? There are children inside, aren’t there?"

<b>

That's right! She couldn't just leave the children inside!

But with such a sinister presence, it was impossible to approach.

<b>

"And besides, the guards are here, right? If something happens, we can ask them for help."

<b>

Startled by Cordelia's words, Annie looked around the facility and saw guards standing watch over the building.

<b>

One of the guards, noticing Annie's gaze, smiled warmly.

But the next moment, that guard was pounced upon by something enormous and was sent flying sideways.

<b>

"!!!"

<b>

Everyone present lost their words.

The creature that took down the first guard leaped at the second without hesitation, incapacitating all the guards in no time.

<b>

"Hah hah! Guards are nothing to worry about!! Now, are there no more nuisances?!"

<b>

As Annie and the others stood in shock, the voice of a man wrapped in malice echoed mockingly around them.

<b>

"Now then! Let’s continue from where we left off yesterday!!"
