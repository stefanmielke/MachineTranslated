# Chapter 101 After School Tea Time

We don't really form a band, you know? (・ω・)

----------------

<b>

"This is tea made from leaves sourced from the southern region of Abenant."

<b>

Abenant is the name of a country located to the west of the Auroral Republic.

Unlike Auroral, which has few seas, Abenant, which is in close contact with the ocean, is said to be a country with active trade.

The tea leaves harvested in its pleasant southern region are of high quality and are known as one of the expensive delicacies exported overseas.

A dandy butler with a white mustache gracefully brews the expensive tea and places the cups before us with great elegance.

With smooth movements, he presents the cups and gently smiles, saying, "Please, enjoy!"

<b>

"Now, please don't hesitate to enjoy it."

"Yes. Thank you very much."

<b>

I took a sip of the tea, which had a rich aroma, as I was encouraged.

<b>

We are currently in one of the lounges located on the top floor of the main school building.

This academy has several lounges, but this one has a slightly different atmosphere from the others.

Apparently, during the time when the aristocracy was still in place, only the daughters of high-ranking nobles were allowed to use this room...

<b>

Indeed, compared to the other lounges, the heavy construction of this room is completely different.

The columns and wainscoting are intricately and delicately carved, lavishly adorned with gold leaf.

The ceiling is painted with a heavenly world in fine brushwork.

It feels like a luxurious structure reminiscent of some palace in Bell or Saiyu.

The butler from earlier is said to be a special person dedicated to this room.

<b>

And most importantly, the person in front of me is Caroline Goldberg, the former daughter of a duke!

A former duke's family, you know? A duke's family!! In other words, this means royal blood, right?!

<b>

Why am I here in a room that looks like a palace salon, in front of such a person?!!

This is definitely not a place for commoners to come, no matter how you think about it! Right?!!

<b>

But since I had heard it was a tea party, I was genuinely terrified that I would be surrounded by the older sisters of the Goldberg faction, but in reality, I was only waiting for the young lady herself.

<b>

"I hope my sudden invitation wasn't a bother? Honestly, I thought you would refuse."

"N-no, to refuse would be unthinkable. I am honored to have been invited."

"Really? If that's the case, I'm glad! I was really looking forward to having tea with you like this."

"Th-that is quite humbling."

<b>

Lady Goldberg seems to be genuinely enjoying our conversation.

Her soft, white-blonde hair, gathered up on her head in waves, exudes a sense of elegance.

Her demeanor is softer than I had imagined, and her tone is casual, giving off a "kind older sister" vibe.

<b>

Even so, I still feel that such occasions are not really suited for me.

No matter how you look at it, I'm just a commoner!!

I can't help but feel an uncomfortable restlessness in my seat, which I think is only natural.

<b>

The young lady seems to notice my discomfort or perhaps not, as she continues to smile and chat happily. Oh, is this shortbread you recommended? Yes, it is very delicious. The sweetness is refined, and the rich butter aroma melts and crumbles in my mouth. Ah, this tea I’m having with it is truly delightful. The butler notices my cup has been reduced without me realizing it and says with a shining smile, "Shall I pour you a refill?" Ah! Right now, this romance-gray, nice middle-aged butler is my only source of comfort!

<b>

"Really, you are as charming as the rumors say, and I can't take my eyes off you."

<b>

Lady Goldberg speaks with such excitement that it feels like she might even attach a heart mark at the end of her sentences. Where on earth did those rumors come from? Am I like a show panda? Am I going to be celebrated just for standing there like that certain Fuutarou-kun who swept the world?

<b>

"As Colin and Dana said, I can't help but feel the urge to hug you and take you home..."

"Y-you're joking, right?"

"Uhehehehe."

<b>

Oh, you're not denying it?

And it turns out the source of the rumors is from her acquaintances.

Please spare me, Sister Colin! After receiving the invitation, when I asked about Lady Goldberg, you said, "She's a kind girl, you know? I think she will be nice to a well-behaved junior!" Plus, you also told me that this lady is the leader of the largest faction in the academy!

And then you said, "Anyway, just do your best!" which was terrifying!

Thanks to that, my hesitation grew immensely!

<b>

So, after receiving the invitation, I was in a state of panic and desperately asked Bibi and Mia to accompany me.

And yet! I was left to go alone!

Bibi said, "There's no way we can go to a lounge only for former high-ranking nobles!"

Well, that's true! But still, I feel like everyone is being too cold! Sniff sniff...

<b>

"I heard about this morning's incident, and I was very impressed. That's why I wanted to talk to you today."

"This morning's... you mean?"

"You quickly resolved the conflict between the new students, right? That's not something just anyone can do."

"Ah, um... n-no, it wasn't anything that grand..."

"Hehe, you also have a sense of humility, don't you?"

<b>

It seems Lady Goldberg is talking about the commotion that happened in front of the classroom this morning. In other words, she is referring to the battle between Miss Cordelia and Miss RuuRii.

But I don't think I really resolved anything. I hardly did anything at all, right?

Rather, I felt like it was Bibi and Mia's pressure that made Miss RuuRii back down. I really didn't do anything!

As I was thinking about this, Lady Goldberg set down her teacup and began to speak in a quiet tone.

<b>

"There are always a few students who misunderstand themselves when they enter this academy."

"Misunderstand... you say?"

"They overestimate themselves, believing they are superior to others, that they are somewhat different from everyone else. Such children, who become trapped in thoughts that don't match their current situation, inevitably arise. It may be unavoidable when they are conscious of their family's expectations and society's gaze..."

<b>

Lady Goldberg spoke with a slight furrow in her brow, looking a bit troubled.

<b>

Although the aristocracy has been abolished for over 150 years, and society appears democratized, the nobles have not lost their status or power.

Many students in this academy are selected from among the children of former nobles or those who have succeeded socially, making them a small elite.

The fact that they attend or have attended this school is recognized as a very high status among the people of the city of Deckenberg.

<b>

I felt this when I registered with the guild.

By starting to work at the tea house, I had the opportunity to understand how the general public perceives us.

Indeed, the trust in students from the academy is extraordinarily high in the city.

<b>

In such a societal perception, some students may become a bit too proud simply because they are students of this school.

What Lady Goldberg is saying is likely about that...

<b>

That being said, when I think about it again, this academy really does have the position of being an "elite school for children of good families," doesn't it?

It feels like I'm saying to myself, "I'm a lady" or "I'm elite," and it makes me feel uneasy. This is way too out of place! I still can't sit comfortably!

After all, I'm not the type to be called a "lady." I only got into this academy because I did a bit better on the physical tests!

That's right! That's right! It's all about physical ability! I'm just a bit good at using my body, not a lady!

In fact, Dana and Irvin are also properly students of the academy, so it's not strange at all! Right?!

<b>

...No, no, no, wait a minute! What am I saying? That would make me sound like I'm part of the muscle-head crew!

That's not it! I'm not one of Dana or Irvin's friends! Absolutely not!!

Ugh, dang it, that hit me a little hard...

<b>

"It's good to have pride, you know? But causing trouble for those around you because of it... that would be troubling, wouldn't it?"

"Y-yes, that's true."

"But you know, as you strive alongside your excellent classmates, I think those kinds of students will naturally settle down."

"Is that how it works?"

"That's how it works. And besides, it seems that this year's new students are quite outstanding..."

"Y-yes, if there are so many outstanding students... then I feel reassured, right?!"

"Really... I have high expectations for you. Ufu."

"Ubu!?"

<b>

I accidentally spat out my tea!

Because Lady Goldberg was smiling so beautifully, with a full smile that seemed to say, "I’m counting on you," and she directed that smile at me!!

I thought she was just making a funny comment, and before I could look for an escape, this happened?!

In other words, she’s saying, "From now on, I’m leaving the new students' troubles to you," right?!

How did it come to this?! That's impossible, right? Right?!

<b>

"Um, Lady Goldberg, that's a bit too much for me..."

"Oh? Aren't you going to call me by my name?!"

"H-huh?"

"Because we're friends now, right? I want to call you 'Suu' like Colin and Dana! ...Is that not okay?"

"N-no! It's not that it's not okay, but..."

"Really?! I'm so happy, Suu! Oh, please call me Carrie!"

"Eh? Ca...? Huh? Huh?"

"Hey, Suu, can I just take you and bring you back to my room...? Is that not okay?"

"Wha?! ...T-that would be a problem, a problem!!"

"Oh, is that so? What a shame."

<b>

What is she saying? What is this person talking about?!!

The conversation is going all over the place, and I can barely keep up, and then she suddenly says she wants to take me home!

This is bad! This is really bad! My mind is spinning!

This person is quite dangerous! If this continues, I feel like I'm going to end up in a terrible situation!

I have to escape! I need to get out of here quickly!!

<b>

<b>

"Hey, you seem to be in a really good mood."

"Oh, you were late, Anthony."

"I'm sorry, the committee took longer than I expected. But it's been a while since I've seen Carrie looking so happy, hasn't it?"

"Oh? Was it? Ufu."

<b>

Just as I was trying to find the right moment to escape while my mind was spinning, a male student opened the door to the lounge.

With his auburn hair flowing and walking in with a natural gait, he seemed to command the afternoon sunlight streaming into the room.

<b>

I know this person.

No, I believe all the students in the school must know him.

He was the one who gave a congratulatory speech to the new students from the stage during the entrance ceremony.

<b>

"H-h-how do you do, Mr. Reinberger? I am Suzy Cloud from Amcam."

<b>

I immediately stood up and greeted him with a curtsy.

By the way, as I stood up, the butler, who had not been informed, silently pulled my chair back for me.

This person is amazing! A true professional!!

<b>

"Ah, thank you for the polite greeting, Miss Cloud. I am Anthony Reinberger. Let's skip the formalities. Please have a seat."

<b>

Anthony Reinberger... the eldest son of a former marquis family (according to Bibi) and a senior student. He is also the student council president, who is ranked number one in popularity among girls (according to Meruru).

Why is he here?! I had no idea he was coming to this tea party?!

<b>

Mr. Reinberger, while encouraging me to sit down, was naturally pulled back by the butler's flowing movements and sat next to Lady Goldberg as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

When I glanced at him, Lady Goldberg noticed my gaze and gave me a very cheerful smile.

<b>

Did I lose my chance to escape?

Ugh, that's scary! That smile is scary!

<b>

----------------

"Hey, are you really okay on your own, Suu-chan?"

"Well, I have some anxiety, but..."

"Isn't it okay? Today is just a face-showing."

<b>

"But I can only see Suu-chan panicking!"

"I can't deny that!"

"This is practically the first top-level meeting of the academy."

"What would Suu-chan say if she knew that?"

"I'd keep quiet!"

"Of course, I won't tell you!"

"I can't say it either..."

<b>

"Well, even if I knew, it wouldn't change anything."

"That's right!"

"What if they think it's easy to take advantage of us?"

"Carrie and the president won't look at us that way."

"If they were the kind of people who would judge us with such eyes, then they are not worth our time!"

"They're not the kind of people who would overlook that, so it's fine."

<b>

"Are they really that kind of people?"

"Well, they will eventually become our major clients. So, Suu, you need to handle them well."

"Well, we can take care of the details! It would be fine for Suu to be taken home once and become a pillow for a night to deepen the friendship!"

"Ahahaha, don't say that to Suu, Bibi! Ahaha."

"No way! A pillow is absolutely out of the question! Lending it out is obviously prohibited!! I won't allow it!!! No way!!"

"「…………」"

"That's not allowed, okay?"

"…It was just a joke, right?"

"If you were taken away, you'd be thinking, 'Well, that's that.'"

"「I wouldn't think that! I wouldn't think that!'」"

Thank you for always reading!

It's been a while since the afterword SS.

I completely forgot I had written this, and I'm adding it now (^▽^;)
