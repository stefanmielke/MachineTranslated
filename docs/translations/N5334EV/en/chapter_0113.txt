# 101 After School Tea Time

I don't have a band.


----------------

<blank>

The tea comes from the southern part of Avenant.

<blank>

Avenant is the name of the country bordering the western side of the Republic of Aurora.

Unlike Aurora, which has few oceans, Avenant, which is widely connected to the sea, is said to be a prosperous trading nation.

The tea leaves from its southern part, where the climate is favorable, are of good quality and are known as one of the most expensive masterpieces to be exported abroad.

The butler, a dandy with a white mustache, brewed the expensive tea in a flowing and graceful manner and placed the cups in front of us in a very elegant manner.

The way she held out the cup with a steady movement and smiled gently, saying, "Here you go," was very dazzling!

<blank>

Please don't hesitate to eat it."

Yes. Thank you very much.

<blank>

I took a sip of the tea, which had a mellow aroma, as recommended.

<blank>

We are now in one of the common rooms on the top floor of the main school building.

The school has a number of common rooms, but this one is a little different from the others.

When the aristocracy was alive and well, only the children of upper nobility were allowed to use this place. ......

<blank>

Indeed, compared to the other common rooms, the room's construction is quite different.

The pillars and hip boards are carved with fine and delicate carvings, which are lavishly decorated with gold leaf.

On the ceiling, the heavenly world is painted with fine brush strokes.

It is as luxurious as a palace in Belle or Sailles.

Even the butler I mentioned earlier is a special person who is exclusive to this room.

<blank>

And, after all, the former duchess Caroline Goldberg is in front of me right now!

Former dukes, you know? Dukes! In other words, this is the bloodline of a king, right?

<blank>

Why am I in front of such a person in a room that looks like a palace salon?

This is not a place for common people to come, no matter what you think! Right?

<blank>

But since I had heard that it was a tea party, I was really scared to death that I would be surrounded by Goldberg-sama's faction sisters, but in fact, it was only the young lady who was waiting for me.

<blank>

I hope I didn't inconvenience you with my sudden invitation. To be honest, I was afraid you would refuse?"

No, no, it would be absurd for me to refuse. I am honored to be asked.

Really? I'm glad to hear it! I've been looking forward to having tea with you.

I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

<blank>

Mr. Goldberg seems to be enjoying himself very much as he says.

Her soft, wavy white-blonde hair, pulled back on top of her head, looked very classy.

Her manner is softer than I had imagined, and her tone of voice is more relaxed, like a 'kind older sister.

<blank>

Nevertheless, I still do not feel that I am suited to this kind of place.

No matter how far you go, you are still a commoner inside!

It can't be helped that the buttocks on which I sit feel unsettled and uncomfortable.

<blank>

Whether or not she noticed me, she was smiling and talking happily to me all the time. Oh, is this the shortbread you recommended? Yes, it is very delicious. The sweetness is very delicate and the buttery flavor is so rich that it seems to fall apart and melt in your mouth. And the tea is really delicious. The butler noticed that the cup of tea was getting low before I knew it and said with a bright smile, "I'll pour you another cup of tea. Oh! So this romance gray, nice middle butler-san is my only comfort now!

<blank>

She really is as lovely to look at as they say she is."

<blank>

I wonder if he put a heart mark at the end of each word. He said it with such glee in his voice that I thought he might have put a heart mark at the end of his sentence.

Where in the world is this rumor coming from? Am I like a panda freak show? Like a certain Futa-kun, who took the world by storm, will I be appreciated just for standing up?

<blank>

As Colin and Dana said, "I can't resist the urge to grab a hug and take it home with me. ......"

You're kidding, right?"

"Mm-hmm."

<blank>

Oh, you don't deny it?

And it turns out that the source of the rumor is a family member.

Give me a break, Miss Colin! When I asked you about Master Goldberg after you gave me the invitation, you said, "He's a good, caring boy, you know? I'm sure he's kind to juniors who are doing well," you said! He also informed me that he is the head of the largest faction in the school!

At the end, he said something like, "Anyway, good luck and have a good trip," which was also scary!

This is the reason why I was so reluctant to go to the store!

<blank>

So, after receiving the invitation, I was so scared that I asked Bibi and Mia to accompany me.

But he was told to go by himself!

Bibi said, "There is no way we can go to a lounge that only former high-ranking nobles can use! Bibi said.

Well, you're right! But I feel like everyone is being too cold? Sick Sick Sick Sick .......

<blank>

I was very impressed with what you said this morning, and I really wanted to talk to you today. I really wanted to talk to you today.

"This morning ......, you say, and?"

You must have been able to put the freshmen squabble behind you in no time at all," he said. That's not easy to do.

"Oh, ah ......, no, no, it's not that big of a deal, it's ......."

"Hmmm, you have humility, too."

<blank>

Apparently, Mr. Goldberg is talking about the mess in the hallway in front of the classroom this morning. In other words, he is talking about the battle between Miss Cordelia and Miss Lurie.

No, but doesn't that mean that I'm not the one who put it away? I didn't do anything.

I felt that the pressure from Bibi and Mia made Miss Ruly back off. I didn't do anything, after all.

As I was thinking about this, Mr. Goldberg put down his teacup and began to speak in a quiet tone.

<blank>

There are inevitably a few children who are mistaken about who they are when they enter this school.

"It's a misunderstanding ......, huh?"

I'm better than the others. Overconfidence that they are a little bit different from others. Not a few children are born with this kind of thinking, which is not in line with their current size. It may be inevitable when they are aware of the expectations of their families and the world's eyes on them. ......

<blank>

Mr. Goldberg said, raising his eyebrows slightly and looking a little troubled.

<blank>

More than 150 years have already passed since the abolition of the aristocracy, and although the society appears to have been democratized, the aristocrats have not lost their status or power.

And many of the students at this academy are children of former nobles, socially successful, etc., a select few further selected from the children of prominent families.

The fact that he is or used to be a student here seems to be recognized as a very high status by the people of De Kembel.

<blank>

That is what I felt when I registered with the union.

By starting to work at the tea house, I had the opportunity to learn about the public's perception of me.

After all, the city has an outstanding level of trust in the school's students.

<blank>

In the midst of such public perception, some students become a little overzealous in becoming a student of this school.

I guess that's what Mr. Goldberg is talking about. ......

<blank>

But still, it's something, isn't it? ......, when you think about it again, this school is an "elite school for children of good families," isn't it?

I feel like I'm calling myself a "lady" or an "elite" and it's making my butt itch. This is so out of place! I'm not sitting well!

I am not a "young lady" at all. I am sure that I was able to get into this school because of my good results in the physical fitness test!

Yes, it is! That's right! Physical strength! I'm just good at using my body a little bit, but I'm not a lady!

In fact, even Dana and Irving are now students at the school, so it's not so strange! Hey, you know what?

<blank>

...... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait me! What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You make it sound like I'm one of the brainiacs!

No, I'm not! I'm not with Dana or Irving! I am definitely not!

Gosh, shoot, now that was sobering to me. ......

<blank>

'It's good to have pride, okay? But if you let it get in the way of being around people, you're going to be in trouble ......?"

Yes, I do.

But don't you think that after some friendly competition amongst the best and brightest students, these kids will naturally settle down?"

Is that what you call it?

That's just the way it is. And after all, this year's freshman class seems to have a lot of talented kids. ......

"Well, if there are so many excellent students, then you can rest assured, can't you, ......?

'Really, ....... I'm counting on you, okay? Ugh."

"Oh, shit!"

<blank>

I couldn't help but blow out my tea!

Because Mr. Goldberg has such a nice smile, such a big smile, as if to say, "I'm asking you to do it!

I was thinking, "This is a funny way to start a conversation," and then, before I had time to look for an escape route, I found this?

In short, they're saying, 'You're in charge of the new student mess from now on,' right?

How did this happen? It's impossible, isn't it? Right?

<blank>

I'm sorry, Mr. Goldberg, but I'm a little overwhelmed. I'm a little overloaded ......"

"Oh, no? You don't read me by name?

Huh?"

I want to call you 'Sue' like Colin and Dana! I wish I could call you 'Sue' like Colin and Dana! ...... no?"

No, no! It's not a no-no, but it's a ......!

Really? I'm so happy for you, Sue! Oh, and you can call me Carrie, right?

What?" Ca ......? Huh? Huh?"

I said, "Hey Sue, why don't I just hold you like this and take you back to your room ......?"

I'm sorry, I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble! ......Ko, I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble, I'm in trouble!"

Oh, really? Too bad."

<blank>

What are you saying? What are you saying? This person?

The conversation went so far and so fast that I could barely keep up with him, and finally he started saying he wanted to take me home!

Oh no! My eyeballs are spinning!

This guy is in a bad way! I have a feeling that he's going to get himself into a lot of trouble if he continues like this!

We must escape from this! We must get out of here quickly!

<blank>

<blank>

Hey, you're in a great mood."

"Oh, you're late, Anthony."

I'm sorry, the committee meeting ran longer than I expected. Still, it's been a long time since I've seen Carrie looking this happy, hasn't it?"

"Oh? Did I? "Uh-huh."

<blank>

Just as I was rolling my eyes and trying to find the right moment to escape, a male student opened the door to the common room.

With her steeple-colored hair fluttering in the wind, she walks into the room with natural steps without hesitation, as if following the afternoon sunlight shining into the room.

<blank>

I know Him.

No, probably the whole school knows about it.

This person was giving a congratulatory speech on behalf of the current students from the podium to the new students during the entrance ceremony.

<blank>

Nice to meet you, Mr. Rheinberger. I am Susie Cloud of Amcam.

<blank>

I immediately got up from my seat and greeted him at the curtesy.

In case you are wondering, as I stood up, the butler was behind me and pulled out my chair without a sound, even though I didn't tell him anything.

This guy is awesome! You are a pro!

<blank>

'Oh, thank you for the polite greeting, Miss Cloud. My name is Anthony Reinberger. Let's dispense with the formalities. Please have a seat."

<blank>

Anthony Leinberger ......, former Marquess's eldest son (according to Bibi) and the most senior student. He is the most popular female student body president at the school (according to Merle).

Why is this person here? I haven't heard at all that he is coming to this tea party?

<blank>

Mr. Leinberger, while urging me to sit down, was pulled out of his chair by Ms. Butler, who also moved fluidly, and naturally sat down next to Mr. Goldberg.

When I glanced next to him, Mr. Goldberg noticed my gaze and gave me a very happy smile.

<blank>

Lost the chance to escape?

 That smile is coy!



<blank>

----------------

Hey, did you really manage all right by yourself, Sue-chan?"

Well, if there's one thing I can say, it's that I'm anxious!"

"I think it's okay, don't you? It's just for show."

<blank>

But all I can see is a picture of Su-chan being nervous.

There's no denying it!"

In effect, this will be the first meeting between the heads of the schools."

What would you say to ...... Sue, if you knew?

I'll keep my mouth shut!"

Of course I won't let you know, will I?"

I can't tell you either. ......

<blank>

Well, knowing about it doesn't change anything.

That's what I mean!"

What if the other side of ...... thinks it's easy to take advantage of?"

Neither Carrie nor the chairman will ever look at you that way, okay?"

If they're judging us with those eyes, then that's all they'll ever be!"

They're not oblivious to it.

<blank>

Is that all they are?"

Well, this is going to be a big client of ours in the near future. We need Sue to deal with them properly.

I'm sure we'll take care of all the details! I'd be happy to have Sue take me home at least once to cuddle with me for the night and get to know me a little better!

Haha, don't tell that to Sue, okay? Bibi! Ha-ha-ha."

Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! And cuddly pillows are definitely not allowed! Lending them out is also forbidden, of course! I will not allow it! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

"............"

No, okay?"

...... just kidding, right?"

"If they take you, you're thinking, 'Well, that's just the way it is,' right?"

I don't think! I don't think!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

This is the first postcard SS in a long time.

I completely forgot that I had written this, so I am just now adding it.
