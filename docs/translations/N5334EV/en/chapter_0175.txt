# 163 Episode Lady Crimson

Oi! Are you listening to me?

<blank>

As if numbed, the man who had just called out to me came screaming at me.

Oops, I got caught up in reminiscing and forgot about this guy.

I guess it's not polite if I don't give him some company.

<blank>

"Don't be a bitch, you little bitch! I'm calling you! Don't ignore me!

<blank>

This guy slams his fist on the table and raises his voice.

You've turned red in the face, your boiling point is so low.

But still, calling a girl you just met a "female" is quite a thing, don't you think?

<blank>

You have a good girth, don't you?

Is he a little shorter than Lombardo in height?

There's something not quite right about unlimited growth of stubble.

He looks like he smells. I don't want him to get too close to me.

<blank>

Suddenly, I looked at the expressions on Bibi and Mia's faces at the edge of my vision and saw .......

No, there is no temperature in their expressions.

<blank>

Come on, come on, come on, come on!

<blank>

Then, he reached out his hand to me, screaming.

Maybe he was trying to grab my arm. ...... Sure enough, the hand grabs the sky with an empty hand.

For a moment, this guy looks dumbfounded, unable to understand why his hand was flailing.

Furthermore, he fell forward on the spot and hit his face on the floor without being able to catch himself.

<blank>

Oh, what a "buggy!" or some terrible voice leaked out. Did you crush your nose?

<blank>

Well, I didn't do much. All I did was shift this guy's behavioral awareness a little bit.

He probably thought he was stepping forward, but his feet were not actually moving, so it was inevitable that he would roll if he moved his center of gravity forward as he did.

<blank>

I often do this as a first check when I'm standing in amcam, but my kids wouldn't be scared off by this level of shifting.

I think this guy is a bit short on training.

<blank>

But is it a little tragic to plunge face-first into the floor?

<blank>

Shit! Who was that? Who tripped me up?

<blank>

No, Anta, he said he rolled on his own.

However, I'm sorry to say that I find it a little funny to see a stern man with tears in his eyes and a nosebleed dripping down his nose.

<blank>

Hey, you! Did you just laugh at me? You little bitch!

<blank>

So stop calling girls you've never met a female a female.

As he tries to stand up further, ivy suddenly grows from the floor and tangles around him.

<blank>

Yeah, it was Mia.

Mia now snapped her fingers and activated the magic.

<blank>

Suddenly, the man is wrapped in ivy all over his body.

The man is still trying to mumble some words even though he is wrapped in a bamboo screen, but the ivy is wrapped all over his face as well, so only muffled sounds are coming out.

<blank>

Do you want me to stop talking?"

<blank>

Mia drops a chilling ......, voice chilled to absolute zero from above.

Yes, this is chilling.

The eyes looking down at you are really chilling. I'm glad you didn't see it.

<blank>

Even though he could not see, the man, perhaps sensing the mia's presence, moved his body once with a jerk and then went quiet.

<blank>

Can you leave it at that?"

<blank>

Then a voice came from the back of the store. A husky but probably female voice.

Immediately the owner of the voice stood up.

You can tell he is a very big man.

<blank>

And you, young lady over there, would you please stop doing that kind of dangerous magic in such a small place?"

<blank>

Bibi had deployed several gravels on top of the man who had been lying down for some time.

A dozen or so pebbles, each about five centimeters in diameter, are spinning at high speed, waiting to shoot out around the man at any moment.

This is a "gravel bullet," a magic with a small earth attribute.

It's true that if I shot out this kind of magic here, these floorboards would be battered and bruised.

<blank>

There is no hostility on his part as he approaches with a wry smile.

When Bibi realized this, he gave a small shrug and then dispersed the magic and disappeared.

<blank>

Thanks. He's a newcomer to town. He's a self-deluded, ignorant, self-deluded idiot, but it's good medicine.

<blank>

The woman who approached me was still quite large.

I think he's taller than Howard Papa.

His body was very muscular and his skin had a light green tinge.

The grinning mouth has white fangs that are a little long to be called double-toothed.

Its appearance is definitely a sea ha0k!

<blank>

This person is that one, the one of the species called "Half Giant".

I've seen you around town from time to time, but this is the first time we've spoken in person.

<blank>

That's bad. Bouncers come in all shapes and sizes. The kind of bouncers you have just met are at best bouncers for small-town thugs. They can't be attached to protect VIPs at all.

<blank>

The person muttered, "Even more so for those who can't even gather information properly ......," and instructed others to carry the man lying on the floor.

We know that he is someone who has influence over these men.

<blank>

You guys are here for the association, right? The reception desk is this way. I'll show you around."

<blank>

The person looked over his shoulder and said so.

<blank>

Oops, I'm late. My name is Rudri. Nice to meet you!

Oh, we're at .......

I mean, why did you guys come in through the back door of the pub?"

<blank>

Hmm?

<blank>

If you'd come in through the front entrance, you'd have walked straight up the stairs to the reception desk."

<blank>

Yes?

<blank>

The pub was set up to make it easy for MISHOP members to use it for after-work relaxation, meetings, etc. "You didn't get caught by the smell of alcohol, did you? I'm sure you weren't lured by the smell of alcohol, were you?" I said, laughing.

<blank>

Oh, yeah? And if you look at Bibi and Mia, you'll see .......

<blank>

Because, Sue, you are going forward so confidently. I wondered if she wanted to enter from this side. I wondered.

I know it's not what you're after! I know you weren't aiming for that!"

<blank>

By the way, Cu Emel, when you showed me the location on the map, you pointed to about two places ...... like ......?

Kuh-oh! Was I being toyed with again?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

............ that's the "Lady in Crimson."

<blank>

Huh? What? Did someone say something?

<blank>

Here we go! Sue, let's go!"

"...... Uh-huh."

<blank>

I turned around but no one was looking at me.

Oh well.

We followed Rudri's lead and went through the thick door at the back of the pub.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Is that thing ...... so?"

Oh, there's no mistaking it. There is no mistaking that hair. I definitely saw her slaughter a hexenbiest in an instant."

<blank>

I also heard that you destroyed the Anatolian organization in the old civic district.

Yes, that's her. I saw that too. I am horrified even now when I remember it. What's terrifying is that she's causing a pool of blood around her, and yet she doesn't get a single drop of blood back. And yet, her eyes looking around coldly... ......!

<blank>

Everyone thought the stories that came out last year about taking down a thousand bandits in Grolska and destroying a pirate fleet off the coast of Oceanoos were eyebrow-raising. ......

You saw that thick killing spirit that was released just for a moment. He didn't even realize that he had momentarily atrophied."

<blank>

That's the thing, Amcam's ......."

Yes, no doubt about it. That's Lady Crimson, the Bloody Lady. The Princess of Amkam.
