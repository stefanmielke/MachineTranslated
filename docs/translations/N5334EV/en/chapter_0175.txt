# Chapter 163: Lady Crimson

"Hey! Are you listening?!"

<b>

The man who had called out to me earlier shouted at me, seemingly losing his patience.

Oops, I got so caught up in my memories that I forgot about this guy's presence.

Isn't it a bit rude not to engage with him at all?

<b>

"Don't act all cool, you little brat! I'm calling you! Don't ignore me!"

<b>

He slammed his fist on the table, raising his voice.

His face was bright red; he has quite a low boiling point.

Still, calling a girl he just met a "brat" is a bit much, isn't it?

<b>

He's got a good build.

He's probably just a bit shorter than Lombard?

His unkempt beard looks kind of gross.

He looks like he would smell bad. Definitely the type I don't want to get too close to.

<b>

Glancing at the expressions of Bibi and Mia at the edge of my vision...

Not good, their faces are devoid of warmth.

<b>

"Just come here already!!"

<b>

Then, while he was yelling, he reached out his hand toward me.

He might have intended to grab my arm, but... as expected, his hand grasped nothing but air.

For a moment, he seemed unable to understand why his hand had missed, wearing a dazed expression.

Then he toppled forward, unable to brace himself, and slammed his face into the floor.

<b>

Oh, I think I heard a terrible sound like "bugyuu!" Did he crush his nose or something?

<b>

Well, I didn't do much. All I did was slightly shift his awareness.

He probably thought he was stepping forward, but his feet weren't moving at all, so it was inevitable that he would lose his balance if he shifted his weight forward.

<b>

It's something I often do at the start of an Amukam match, but my kids wouldn't even flinch from this level of distraction.

This guy might just not be trained enough.

<b>

However, face-planting into the floor is a bit tragic, isn't it?

<b>

"Damn it! Who tripped me?!"

<b>

No, you fell on your own.

But seeing this tough guy with tear-filled eyes and blood pouring from his nose while yelling is, I must admit, a bit funny.

<b>

"Y-you! You just laughed, didn't you?! You little brat!!"

<b>

So stop calling a girl you just met a brat.

As he tries to get back up, suddenly vines reach out from the floor and wrap around him.

<b>

Yep, that's Mia's doing.

Mia just snapped her fingers to activate her magic.

<b>

In an instant, the man was completely bound up in vines.

Even though he was wrapped up, he was still trying to mumble something, but since the vines were tightly wound around his face, only muffled sounds escaped.

<b>

"Could you not talk?"

<b>

Mia's voice fell from above, cold as ice... absolutely frigid.

Yeah, that sends a chill down my spine.

Her gaze looking down at him is also incredibly chilling. It's a good thing he can't see it.

<b>

Even without seeing, the man seemed to sense Mia's presence, and after a brief shudder, he fell silent.

<b>

"Could you keep it down over there?"

<b>

At that moment, a voice came from the back of the tavern. It was husky but probably a woman's voice.

Immediately, the owner of the voice stood up.

It's clear she's quite large.

<b>

"Hey, miss over there, could you stop using such dangerous magic in this cramped space?"

<b>

Bibi had somehow summoned several small stones hovering over the man who was now rolling on the ground.

About a dozen small stones, each around 5 centimeters in diameter, were spinning rapidly around him, ready to be launched at any moment.

This is a low-level earth magic called "Stone Bullet."

If she were to cast such magic here, the floor would definitely get wrecked.

<b>

As she approached with a wry smile, there was no hostility in her demeanor.

Realizing this, Bibi shrugged slightly and dispersed her magic.

<b>

"Thanks. This guy's a country bumpkin who just came to town recently. He's a fool who mistook his ignorance for confidence, but I guess this was a good lesson for him."

<b>

The woman who approached was indeed quite large.

She might even be taller than Papa Howard?

Her body was very muscular, and her skin had a slight green tint.

Her smile revealed slightly elongated fangs that gleamed white.

Without a doubt, she looks like a Sea H〇wk!

<b>

This woman belongs to the race known as "Half-Giants."

I've seen them around town occasionally, but this is the first time I've talked to one directly.

<b>

"Sorry about that. Not all bouncers are created equal. The kind of guy who just tried to mess with you is usually just a thug from a small town. They can't be relied on for protecting important people."

<b>

She muttered, "Especially those who can't even gather information properly..." while directing those around her to carry the man who was now on the floor.

It's clear she's someone with influence over these men.

<b>

"You all have business with the guild, right? The reception is over here. I'll guide you."

<b>

She looked over her shoulder at us and said that.

<b>

"Oh, I should introduce myself. I'm called Rudori. Nice to meet you!"

"Oh, we are..."

"By the way, why did you all come in through the back pub?"

<b>

Huh?

<b>

"If you had entered through the front entrance, you would have gone straight up the stairs to the reception."

<b>

Huh?

<b>

Apparently, this tavern is a pub set up for guild members to use for relaxation after work or for meetings. She laughed and said, "You didn't get lured in by the smell of alcohol, did you?"

<b>

R-really? I looked at Bibi and Mia...

<b>

"Well, because Sue was confidently leading the way. I thought maybe she wanted to come in from this side?"

"Well! I knew you weren't aiming for it, but still!"

<b>

Now that I think about it, when Kuu Emel showed me the map, she pointed to two places... didn't she?

Ahh! Was I being toyed with again?!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"...........That is 'Lady Crimson.'"

<b>

Huh? What did someone just say?

<b>

"Look! Sue, let's go!"

"....Oh, okay."

<b>

I turned around, but no one was looking our way.

Well, whatever.

For now, I followed Rudori, who was guiding us, and we passed through the thick door at the back of the pub.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Is that... really it?"

"Yeah, no doubt about it. That hair is unmistakable. I definitely saw her slay a magical beast in an instant."

<b>

"I heard she wiped out the Anatris organization in the old citizen district."

"That's right, it was her. I saw that too. Even now, it sends chills down my spine. What's terrifying is that while the surroundings were a sea of blood, she didn't have a single drop on her. And that cold gaze as she surveyed the area...!"

<b>

"Last year, there were rumors that she defeated a band of thieves numbering around a thousand in Grolska, and that she annihilated a pirate fleet off the coast of Oceanos. Everyone thought those stories were exaggerated..."

"I saw it, that intense killing intent released for just a moment. She didn't even realize she had shrunk back in fear."

<b>

"That is... Amukam's..."

"Yes, without a doubt. That is Lady Crimson, 'The Bloodstained Lady.' The princess of Amukam."
