# Chapter 190: Outdoor Class

Starting this weekend, the first-year students are scheduled to participate in a group activity called "Outdoor Class."

This is about "learning how to live in nature," commonly referred to as "bushcraft."

The camp will take place over a two-night, three-day schedule starting this weekend.

<b>

The location is the Rohan Nature Park in Boltosnan.

It is where Miss Cordelia's family home is located.

<b>

This nature park has a long history and is said to be a famous tourist spot.

The nature park is very comfortable even in this season due to the geothermal heat from the Rohan volcano, and hot springs and geysers can be seen in various places.

The hot springs flow down to the foot of the mountain, where the hot spring town shows its lively atmosphere.

<b>

The nature park itself is quite far from human settlements, deep in the mountains, and is isolated from the secular world.

The rivers and springs are rich in fish, and wild plants and fruits are abundant, making it a place overflowing with the blessings of the mountains.

<b>

Camping for two nights and three days in this nature park and living self-sufficiently is what this "Outdoor Class" is about.

<b>

<b>

However, there is a deep forest between the nature park and the Rohan volcano, and it is said that there are some magical beasts there.

Even so, the threat level is said to be at most between 0.3 and 0.6, not even reaching 1.

<b>

If you go near the volcano, there are magical beasts with threat levels exceeding 10, but you would have to venture quite deep into the forest to encounter them.

Well, it is said that there are sufficient barriers in the nature park, so it probably isn't something to worry about too much.

In any case, it can't be compared to the Amukam Forest.

<b>

<b>

"Is it true that you will be providing protection for the students during this 'Outdoor Class'?"

<b>

The "big brother" of the gardeners, the chairman, came to ask for protection this weekend.

Considering the "Outdoor Class" taking place this week and the recent incident involving Karen, I wondered if that was the case and asked the chairman...

<b>

"The Amukam folks have been on the teaching side every year."

<b>

In response to my question, the chairman replied with a smile.

<b>

Indeed, if they are from Amukam, camping in the forest for a day or two is something they do regularly.

Moreover, the people of Amukam gain experience living alone in the forest for a week when they turn 14.

<b>

According to the chairman, if an Amukam person joins the camping team, the others get left behind and it doesn't become a learning experience...

That makes sense.

<b>

Therefore, it seems that Amukam alumni are "to refrain from intervening and only provide minimal advice and guidance."

In this "Outdoor Class," the Amukam group is said to be in a supervisory position rather than as students.

<b>

"â€¦So, I think you can provide security for the students without it being unnatural."

<b>

I have heard the details of the recent incident involving Karen from Uncle Philip.

It is undoubtedly true that the eldest son of the Niven family is targeting her, and personal protection is still ongoing.

In particular, the enthusiasm of the Amukam brothers and sisters is extraordinary.

Moreover, it seems that Will, who should have already returned to knight school, has extended his stay by about a week with the permission of Lady Carry's father to help protect the academy.

<b>

As for me, I am determined to swiftly return anyone who dares to extend their malicious hands not only toward Karen but also toward the twins, as soon as they are detected.

<b>

<b>

"I understand. Please leave Karen's protection to me."

<b>

"Yeah. I have judged that there is no problem entrusting her to you from the beginning..."

<b>

"?"

<b>

"But before that, I would like you to provide protection for certain individuals."

<b>

Huh? It's not for Karen's protection?

I peered suspiciously at the chairman's face while holding my cup.

<b>

"I would like to ask for protection to the Munanotos Mine."

<b>

Huh? Is that related to Karen's family?

Whose protection are you planning to request?

A multitude of question marks bounced around in my head.
