# 190 Outdoor Class

Starting this weekend, freshmen will have a group activity called "outdoor class.

This is called "learning how to live in nature," or "bushcraft.

This camp will be held for three days and two nights starting this weekend.

The location is Rohan Nature Park in Bortosunan.

This is where Miss Cordilia's parents live.

<blank>

This natural park has a very long history and is a famous tourist attraction.

The natural park is said to be very pleasant even in this season due to the geothermal heat of the Rohan volcano, and hot springs and geysers can be seen in many places.

The hot spring water that gushes out runs to the foot of the mountain, and the foot of the mountain is a bustling hot spring resort.

The nature park itself is located deep in the mountains, well away from human habitation and secluded from the secular world.

The rivers and springs are rich in fish, and the wildflowers and nuts are abundant and full of the bounty of the mountains.

<blank>

The "outdoor class" is to spend three days and two nights camping in this nature park, and to be self-sufficient.

But there is a deep forest between the nature park and the Rohan volcano, and they say there are some magical beasts there.

Even so, they are all less than 1, with a threat value of 0.3 to 0.6 at best.

<blank>

If you go close to the volcano, there are apparently a fair number of magical beasts with a threat value of 10 or higher, but you are unlikely to encounter them unless you go very deep into the forest.

Well, they say the nature park is well warded, so I guess it is nothing to worry about so much.

Either way, it doesn't need to be compared to the Amcam forest.

"You mean you'll be escorting the students on this 'field trip'?"

<blank>

The chairman of the board, the gardener's 'brother', asked me to escort him this weekend.

Is that what the "field trip" this week, combined with the incident that happened to Karen the other day, is all about? I decided to ask the Chancellor about it. ......

<blank>

We have the AmCam guys on the mentoring end of things every year."

<blank>

To my question, the chairman of the board responded with a smile.

<blank>

It's true that if you're from Amkam, it's normal to camp out in the woods for a day or two.

Above all, the people of Amkam have the experience of surviving in the forest alone for just one week for anyone who reaches the age of 14.

<blank>

According to the board president, when an Amcam person joins a camp team, the people around them are left behind and don't learn. ......

You are quite right.

<blank>

That's why he asks those from Amcam to "stay out of it as much as possible, and give them the bare minimum of advice and counsel.

For this "outdoor learning," the AMCAMs are in a position to supervise, not to be on the student side.

<blank>

Since it's ......, I'm sure they'll be able to provide security for the students without any unnaturalness."

<blank>

I heard about Karen's story the other day from my Uncle Philip.

There is no doubt that the guy who was the eldest son of the Niven family is targeting him, and his personal security is still in place.

In particular, the motivation of the older brothers and sisters of AMCAM is not too strong.

Will, on the other hand, should have already returned to the knight's school, but he has extended his return to the school for about a week to protect the school because he got permission from Carrie-sama's father.

<blank>

I, for my part, am determined to return to the atom as soon as my detection catches any person who tries to extend his evil hand not only to Karen but to the twins as well.

<blank>

<blank>

I understand. Leave it to me to take care of Karen.

<blank>

'Yeah, I'm sure she's fine with it. As for her, I've decided from the beginning that I have no problem letting you handle her. ......"

<blank>

?"

<blank>

But first, I'd like you to help me escort a few people.

<blank>

Huh? Aren't you Karen's escort?

He looked quizzically into the chancellor's face as he held the cup.

<blank>

I need you to escort me to the Munanotos mine."

<blank>

Huh? Is that Karen's parents' house?

Who are you planning to ask to escort you?

A number of question marks popped up around my head.
