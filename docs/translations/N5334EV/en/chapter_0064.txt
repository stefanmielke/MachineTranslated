# Chapter 59: Howard Cloud's Decision

What was prepared was a night dress with a heart-shaped cut at the chest and large shoulders exposed.

It was tightly cinched to emphasize the waistline, and from there, a tiered skirt with plenty of frills spread out.

The snow-white fabric had a subtle bluish hue that was elegant.

It looked very cute, and it was to my liking.

<b>

But thinking about being exposed to that gaze again makes me feel heavy.

Well, emotionally, I've already pulled myself together! But still, unpleasant things are unpleasant!

<b>

The welcome event for the delegation that night was held in the form of a standing buffet.

<b>

As expected, the unpleasant gazes were sticking to me, but Anna Mary, who was by my side, seemed to notice that I was uncomfortable with Mr. Fourier's gaze and maintained a position that casually blocked the view.

<b>

I can already ignore such gazes, so I'm fine, but... I appreciate that thoughtfulness!

<b>

"Your Highness?! It really is Your Highness!"

<b>

A familiar voice flew in from the side.

<b>

"Good evening, Lysa. Are you having fun?"

<b>

"Ah! Your Highness! That appearance! Your demeanor is truly lovely!!"

<b>

Please stop! I was just trained for this! The gazes of Anna Mary and Miss Elrose watching from behind are scary! It's just a temporary measure!!

<b>

"The color of the dress suits you very well. It's truly wonderful, Princess Suzy."

<b>

Marguerite and Simon were also present.

Eek~~! Is that a killer compliment from Marguerite?

Simon was just nodding with a smile!

<b>

All three of them seemed to be in knightly formal attire.

They were without their usual gauntlets and shin guards, and their jackets were well-tailored.

They wore epaulettes on their shoulders and had gold braids on their chests.

It looked distinctly like military formal wear.

<b>

The decorations are quite flashy, aren't they? Kind of like Takarazuka?

Especially for a beauty like Marguerite, the charm of a woman in men's clothing is overwhelming, right?!

Is it that they bloom nobly?!

And on top of that, those lines! Are they trying to bring me down?!!

<b>

<b>

"Just in time, Your Highness, let me introduce you. This is our battalion commander."

<b>

Marguerite brought over a robust-looking older man.

He must be over 180 cm tall? With black hair and a mustache, and many scars on his cheeks.

His sharp gaze clearly belonged to a seasoned warrior.

<b>

"It is an honor to meet you. I am Cedric Meyer, commander of the 12th Mobile Heavy Cavalry Brigade, and I have been entrusted with the command of this knightly order. Princess Suzy of Amcam."

<b>

When Mr. Meyer introduced himself, he stared intently at me.

How nice... a true warrior's eyes. They are the same as everyone from Amcam. Totally different from that representative!

I couldn't help but smile happily.

<b>

"Nice to meet you, I am Suzy Cloud. I sincerely welcome you all to our arrival."

<b>

As I returned the introduction, Mr. Meyer murmured with admiration.

<b>

"As expected of the Princess of Amcam. You possess strong eyes that do not fear."

<b>

Huh? Did I just get complimented? I tilted my head in surprise.

<b>

"No, it seems I have a rather poor gaze, and I often frighten women, especially at first sight..."

<b>

He smiled a bit shyly.

<b>

"I don't think that's the case, do you? You have very deep, compassionate eyes."

<b>

"Commander! What is the meaning of this?! The commander is chatting with a girl? Seriously?!!"

<b>

While I was laughing with Mr. Meyer, someone from behind called out in surprise.

<b>

"Stand down, Kyle! This is the Princess of Amcam! My apologies, Your Highness. This is Kyle Irvine, the deputy commander of our battalion."

<b>

When I turned around, there stood a handsome young man with beautiful blonde hair and gentle eyes.

His eyes were a clear sky blue, and his nose was straight and well-formed.

Wow... what should I do, he's incredibly handsome... Is there some sort of spotlight shining from behind him?

<b>

"My apologies, Princess. I am Kyle Irvine, the captain of the first hundred of the Mobile Heavy Cavalry Brigade. It is a great honor to have the opportunity to meet you."

<b>

As I was captivated, he gave an exaggerated greeting, knelt before me, took my hand, and... k-k! He kissed it!!

A knight! There's a knight here!! A knight! Oh, it's a knightly order!

What am I saying?!!

<b>

"...I am Suzy Cloud. Mr. Irvine. That is a very elegant greeting. Do all the knights of the royal capital do this?"

<b>

"Princess! Please grant me the honor of calling you Kyle. My knee also seeks to submit to your beauty... I cannot help but wish for a bond with you that will last through the ages..."

<b>

Isn't he saying something incredibly cheesy?! The grip on my hand is getting stronger!!

I can feel my face heating up from the intense gaze piercing from below!!

<b>

"Your Highness! Please be careful! Deputy Commander Kyle is known as a 'womanizer'!"

<b>

Lysa warned me from behind! So he's really a womanizer!!

<b>

"His skills are the best in the battalion, but... when it comes to women... Hey, Kyle! You're being too rude to the Princess!"

<b>

"What are you saying, Commander! I'm being completely serious! This is my true feeling!! It's love at first sight!!!"

<b>

Bwahh!!

<b>

"...You, huh..."

<b>

"My apologies, young lady. Your lord is calling for you."

"Anna Mary... I understand, I'll go right away. I'm sorry, but I'm being called by my father, so I must take my leave. Please continue to enjoy yourselves."

<b>

<b>

At the perfect timing, Anna Mary pulled me away.

I was about to freeze up!

Oh no, I'm sure my face is bright red!

Are all handsome men like this? 

Is it that all pretty boys are enemies?!!

<b>

"Thank you, Anna Mary. I don't know what to do anymore..."

"He's a dangerous person... Shall we deal with that filthy representative tonight?"

"What do you mean? That sounds scary?! Please stop it!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

****************************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Kyle, you're being too ridiculous! Think a little about your position!"

"No, I'm being completely serious! She'll be an incredibly beautiful woman in 4 to 5 years! She'll definitely be the talk of the country! If I don't reserve my place now, I'll regret it for sure!!"

"That's why saying things like 'reserve' for women is... Enough! Either way, that princess is not that kind of person!"

"What kind of person do you mean?"

"I've heard various rumors before coming here... so I decided to test her a bit."

"Huh? What are you trying to do, Commander?"

"I infused a bit of killing intent when we exchanged greetings. It's something that would make a typical girl sit down. It's not a big deal."

"Ugh?!"

"I was surprised. Instead of being shaken, she smiled back! She doesn't even feel our level of killing intent as a breeze! Wow! The Princess of Amcam is something else!"

"What are you doing?!! You can't be serious! She's the daughter of a lord?! This isn't a time to be laughing!! What are you doing?!"

<b>

"Marguerite, commander..."

"I know, I know, Lysa. I can't let this commander or the deputy commander run wild..."

"We'll do our best together, the three of us! Commander!!"

"Please, Lysa and Simon. I trust you..."

"Trusting Lysa completely is a bit dangerous, though..."

"J-Jimon, that's cruel?!!"

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The knightly order arrived in Amcam, and the next morning.

Amid the transparent morning sunlight and the sound of birds, Amcam House was already enveloped in the bustle of many people.

It might remind one of the time when this building was used as a castle.

<b>

In such an early morning hour, a tense voice echoed through a room in Amcam House.

<b>

"What is the meaning of this...? Do you intend to settle for such a level of military strength? To say that nameless individuals should accompany the knightly order?"

"However, Representative Fourier, this is the maximum military strength at present. Moreover, they are not inferior to those with grades."

"Hmph! What use is it to have people whose names are unknown?! The citizens do not seek such individuals! Isn't that right, Representative Fourier?"

<b>

Nodding with a stern expression, Cameron Fourier acknowledged Connor Clark's words.

<b>

This is the third conference room on the first floor of Amcam House.

In this room, about one-third the size of the council chamber, the men were engaged in heated discussions.

One was Cameron Fourier, the representative of the delegation that arrived yesterday.

And the other was Connor Clark, who served as the assistant representative of the delegation.

They were discussing the departure of the investigation team involving the three great families of Amcam and Howard Cloud.

<b>

Currently, Cameron Fourier and Connor Clark were openly expressing their dissatisfaction with the insufficient military strength provided by Amcam.

August Dales, the village chief, was attempting to explain the current situation and admonish them.

<b>

"...It is not the citizens who are seeking, but you."

"Stop it! Silence!"

<b>

Silence Kuroki spat out venomous words.

Alphonse Beas admonished him.

<b>

Howard Cloud quietly listened to their debate.

<b>

"If you want to assign those with grades... those above A grade, you will have to wait another month, you know?"

"Do you intend to take another month?! We have already consumed nearly three months since leaving the royal capital! The citizens wish for a resolution as soon as possible! Are you saying you want to extend their days of anxiety by another month?!"

<b>

At August's words, Connor Clark stood up and raised his voice.

<b>

"Then you should go by yourselves."

"That's why I'm telling you to stop, Silence."

<b>

Once again, Silence muttered poison.

Hearing that, Connor Clark glared at Silence with a nervous expression.

<b>

"What does it mean that there are almost no upper-level forces? Isn't there a flaw in the management system?"

<b>

Cameron Fourier restrained Connor Clark with his hand and quietly questioned Amcam's management system.

<b>

<b>

"First of all! More than half of those with grades are out on requests from the country! Don't you have any awareness of the country's responsibility?!"

"That is not our jurisdiction! It is unreasonable to bring this up with the investigation team!! What we are asking now is how you intend to provide the necessary military strength!!!"

<b>

Silence couldn't hold back and raised his voice.

Connor Clark snapped back at him.

<b>

"Don't make me say it again! Those with grades won't return for another month!"

"Isn't it your duty to do something about that?! The agreement with the kingdom! Do you intend to fulfill it?!"

"…!! Are you bringing that up here now?! We have already provided sufficient military strength and technical assistance!!"

"Hmph! Is it not rude to treat Representative Fourier with such disrespect?! There is no sense of respect towards him! Representative Fourier is of the bloodline connected to General Baldermonte! It would not be strange for him to hold a title in another era! And yet...!!"

"Hmph! Is there anyone in Amcam who bows their head to bloodlines?!"

"Tch! 'The blood of the frontier is thin' is a saying well known..."

"'The blood of the center is fragrant' is also often heard!"

"!! What?! Are you intending to criticize the kingdom?!!"

"Stop it, Clark."

"Silence! Enough already!!"

<b>

As Clark stood up, Fourier restrained him with his hand, and Alphonse placed a hand on Silence's shoulder, admonishing the two who were exchanging words.

<b>

Watching quietly, Howard finally spoke up.

<b>

"......Is it that you feel uneasy with just the 10th's members? Is that what you're saying?"

"Of course! Only those of renown can ensure the success of this investigation. Naturally, the citizens will feel reassured by that."

<b>

Under the pressure of Howard's gaze, Cameron Fourier momentarily held his breath.

However, trying to push back that fear, he leaned forward and implored for his demands.

Before long, Fourier was lightly sweating on his forehead.

<b>

"You are in a hurry... You wish to depart immediately. Is that what you're saying?"

<b>

An even stronger light ignited in Howard's eyes.

<b>

"...Y-yes, that is correct. It has already been nearly a year since the anomalies began... For the sake of the citizens... I believe we should head to the Great Forest as soon as possible..."

<b>

Fourier tried to speak again but realized his lips were dry.

Clumsily licking his lips and swallowing, he answered Howard's question while suppressing his trembling throat.

Next to him, Clark was wide-eyed, frozen in place, experiencing the pressure of a strong person for the first time.

<b>

The air in the room felt heavy, as if it were pressing down on their bodies.

<b>

<b>

"I see... I understand! Then I shall go myself!!"

<b>

However, Howard, seemingly unconcerned with the atmosphere in the room, casually declared.

<b>

"Wha?! W-what do you mean?!"

"Commander! What are you doing?!"

"That's reckless, Commander!!"

"Commander! Please wait!"

<b>

At Howard's words, Fourier gasped, and August, Silence, and Alphonse widened their eyes in protest.

<b>

"Am I lacking in military strength? Is that what you're saying, Fourier?"

"N-no, that is absolutely not the case! What dissatisfaction could there be in having Lord Cloud, known as the 'Iron Demon God', lead the expedition?!"

<b>

"Then it's settled. We will depart three days from now. Prepare urgently in the meantime."

"Commander! Please wait! Reconsider your decision!!"

"Don't worry, August. It's been a long time since my last expedition! Silence! Alphonse! Let's start preparing!!"

<b>

Ignoring the bewildered Fourier and the attempts of August to stop him, Howard was raising his voice alone.

<b>

"Give up, August. Once the commander has made up his mind, he cannot be stopped."

"But! ...What will you say to Lady Sonia?!"

<b>

Having quickly given up on persuading Howard, Silence tried to soothe August, but August expressed his concern for Sonia.

<b>

"I'm sorry, August. This is my last selfish act... I will speak to Sonia myself."

"…C-Commander..."

<b>

Placing a hand on August's shoulder, Howard spoke with a calm expression.

Feeling the warmth of that shoulder, August clenched his hands in regret.

<b>

"Fourier, you should focus on the rest of your personnel! Iroshio is an unusual magical realm. Make sure to recover your strength sufficiently!"

"…Yes. I appreciate your thoughtfulness."

"August! Silence! Alphonse! Prepare for the exploration of Iroshio! We depart three days from now! On the 29th of the second blue moon!!"

<b>

That day, Howard Cloud made the decision to depart with the investigation team.

<b>

----------------

"Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Meyer. Make sure to replenish your energy tonight!"

"Thank you, Lord Cloud. I express my gratitude on behalf of the team."

"Indeed! I have also received the letter from Reinwald. I will not cause you any inconvenience during your stay in Amcam."

"Yes! I am honored. The knight commander has also instructed me to convey his regards to Lord Cloud."

"Hmm, Reinwald Kreiner... I'm glad to hear he's doing well. If you need anything during your stay, feel free to ask at any time."

"Thank you. The three members of the advance team here are already known to you. If you have any requests, please contact either of us or our deputy commander, Kyle Irvine."

"Yes, yes! I look forward to working with you, Mr. Irvine!"

"Yes! I am Kyle Irvine, serving as the deputy commander. Please remember me."

"…By the way, Mr. Irvine, I hear you are the best knight in this team?"

"No, I'm still just a novice..."

"Ah! You have humility as well! Very well! How about we have a sparring match after the banquet?"

"…After this?"

"Yes! Reinwald also asked me to take care of those with potential! It would be better to do it sooner rather than later, right?"

"…Is that so…"

"Don't worry! It's just a light sparring after a long journey! You might even sleep better afterward! Right?"

"…Yes."

"Yes! A proper sparring match is best in the morning! Yes, yes! Let's enjoy ourselves to the fullest tomorrow morning! Right, Mr. Irvine? Hahaha!"

"…Huh…"

"Uh, um, Commander Cloud... doesn't he seem a bit different than usual... scary?"

"Keep your voice down, Lysa! He'll hear you."

"Ah, I-I feel like a really dark aura is rising from Lord Cloud!"

"This is the deputy commander's karma. It's self-inflicted."

"Eek! I feel like Lord Cloud's eyes are glowing red?! Is it just my imagination?!"

"It seems the deputy commander's greeting caught Lord Cloud's attention."

"Jimon... does that mean the deputy commander is... Oh no! Lord Cloud's aura has swelled even more!"

"Look at the commander... he's already ignoring the deputy commander and avoiding any involvement. We shouldn't look either! Understand?"

"Ah... Deputy Commander, my condolences. But it's your own doing..."
