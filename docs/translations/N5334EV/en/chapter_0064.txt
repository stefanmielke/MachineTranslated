# 59 Howard Cloud's Decision

The nightdress provided was a nightdress with a heart-cut top at the bust and large shoulders.

The waistline is tightened to emphasize the waistline, and the tiered skirt with many frills spreads out from there.

The snow-white fabric has a refined pale blue tinge.

It looks very pretty and is just the way I like it.

<blank>

But I'm so nervous about being subjected to that gaze again.

Well, I've long since changed my mind! I don't like what I don't like, after all!

<blank>

That evening, the reception for the delegation took the form of a standing buffet party.

<blank>

As I expected, a nasty look came to me, but AnnaMarie, who was standing by my side, seemed to notice that I did not like the way Mr. Houllier was looking at me, and she maintained a position that prevented me from looking at him.

<blank>

I can already pass through such stares, so I'm fine with it...but I'm glad you're so considerate!

<blank>

Princess? I knew it was the Princess!"

<blank>

A familiar voice came flying in from the side.

<blank>

How are you doing, Raisa? Are you enjoying yourself?"

<blank>

Oh! Princess! Your appearance! You are so beautiful in your behavior!"

<blank>

Please stop! I was just trained! I'm afraid of the stares from AnnaMarie and Elrose, who are watching behind me, telling me to behave properly in this kind of situation! I'm afraid of the stares of AnnaMarie and Elrose, who are looking at me behind my back and telling me to behave properly in such an occasion!

<blank>

The color of your dress is very flattering on you. It's really lovely, Princess Susie."

<blank>

Mr. Magritte and Mr. Djimon were also there.

Hee~~! Mr. Magritte, is that your kill line?

Mr. Djimon just smiled and nodded!

<blank>

All three of you seem to be dressed in knight's formal wear.

He is wearing a well-tailored jacket without the usual cuirass and shin guards.

She wears epaulettes on her shoulders and gold braid on her chest.

It was clearly the formal attire of the military.

<blank>

Are the decorations quite gaudy? Is it somewhat Takarazuka-esque?

Especially with a beautiful woman like Ms. Magritte, she looks like a beautiful woman in men's clothing!

Blooming nobly, you mean?

And then that line! Oh, are you trying to drop me?

<blank>

<blank>

I am pleased to introduce you to the Princess. This is the Captain of our troop."

<blank>

Mr. Magritte brought in a sturdy-looking old man.

I'd say he's over 6 feet tall. He has black hair, a mustache, and many scars on his cheeks.

The sharp look in his eyes is clearly that of a warrior of many battles.

<blank>

'It is an honor to meet you. Princess Suzy of Amkam. My name is Cedric Meyer, Commander of the Twelfth Mobile Heavy Knight Corps of a thousand men. I have been entrusted with the command of this Order.

<blank>

When Mr. Meyer introduced himself, he stared at me.

I like it.................................the eyes of a genuine warrior. It's the same eyes as all of Amcam. It's totally different from that representative!

I can't help but smile with delight.

<blank>

Nice to meet you, Susie Cloud. I'm Susie Cloud, and I'd like to welcome you all to my home.

<blank>

When I introduced myself, Mr. Meyer muttered, "Wow," as if he was impressed.

<blank>

She is the princess of Amkam. She has strong eyes that are not afraid of anything.

<blank>

Huh? Did you get any compliments? I couldn't help but tilt my head a little.

<blank>

No, I don't think I have good eyesight, and I am often frightened by first-time visitors, especially ladies..."

<blank>

He laughed, a little embarrassed.

<blank>

I don't think so, okay? It's a very compassionate look.

<blank>

Battalion Chief! What do you mean? The battalion chief is chatting with a girl? Are you serious?

<blank>

As I was laughing with Mr. Meyer, someone came up behind me and called out to me in a slightly unconcerned manner.

<blank>

'Hold back, Kyle! She's the Princess of Amkam! Excuse me, Your Highness. I'm Kyle Irvine, XO of the battalion.

<blank>

I turned around and there stood a brother with beautiful blonde hair and kind eyes.

Her eyes are a clear heavenly color, and her nose is clean and well-defined.

Wow...what to do, it's a great beauty... What's with all the lighting from behind?

<blank>

I beg your pardon, Your Highness. It is with great pleasure that I have been granted an audience with Kyle Irvine, the first centurion of the Mobile Heavy Knights.

<blank>

I couldn't help but stare at him, and then he greeted me with an exaggerated greeting, got down on one knee in front of me, took my hand, and kissed it! I was kissed on the mouth!

Nah, he's a knight! There's a knightly man! There's a knight! Oh, it's a knight!

What am I talking about?

<blank>

Suzy Cloud, sir. Dear Irvine. A very elegant greeting, isn't it? Is this how all the knights of King's Landing do it?

<blank>

Princess! Please grant me the honor of calling you Kyle. My knees also demand obedience to your beauty.... I cannot help but hope that my relationship with the Princess will last for eternity."

<blank>

Are you saying something very disturbing? The hand you are holding is getting stronger and stronger!

I can feel my face starting to burn from the hot eyes piercing from below...ohhh!

<blank>

Princess! Please be careful! For XO Kyle is a reputed 'codswallop'!"

<blank>

Mr. Raisa warned me from behind! Oh well! You are a codswallop after all!

<blank>

I'm the best in my unit at what I do, but when it comes to women.... Hey, Kyle! You're being too rude to the princess!

<blank>

What are you talking about, Battalion Chief? I'm very serious! I mean it! It's love at first sight!

<blank>

Bwah!

<blank>

You know what?

<blank>

"Pardon me, miss. The master wants to see you."

AnnaMarie... I understand, I'll be right there. I'm sorry, my father has called me, so I'll leave you now. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your stay."

<blank>

<blank>

AnnaMarie took me out at the perfect time.

You almost froze the whole thing!

Oh my god, my face is absolutely red!

Are all beautiful men all anna's?

After all, colored men are the enemy!

<blank>

"AnnaMarie...thank you. I don't know, I just don't know what to do anymore, you know?

You are a tricky man, aren't you? Shall we deal with that filthy representative tonight?

What is that? I'm scared! Stop him if you can!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

****************************************

<blank>

<blank>

Kyle, you've got to be kidding me! You need to think about your place in this world!"

No, I'm serious. I am! She's going to be a very good woman in four or five years! She's going to be famous all over the country! If you don't make a reservation now, you will definitely regret it!

'So, you can't just tell a woman you have reservations or whatever at ....... Enough said! Either way, that princess doesn't have the balls to do that, okay?"

"Yes? What kind of balls are you talking about?"

I heard a lot of rumors before I came here... so I tried a few things."

What is it? What's going on, Battalion Chief?"

I tried to put a bit of a deadly glare on him as we exchanged hellos. What, a little girl would just sit there. It's no big deal."

"AUGH?

I was surprised. Instead of moving, he was calm and even smiled back at me! It doesn't even feel this level of deadly force as if it were a gentle breeze! Oh, no! The Princess of Amkam knows no bounds!"

What the hell are you doing? What are you doing? That's what I can't believe! The other party is the princess of your lord! This is no time to be laughing! What are you doing?

<blank>

Magritte Butaichi..."

I know, I know, Raisa. I know, I know, Raisa. I know, I know.

The three of us will do our best to get you there! Captain!

Please, Raisa, Djimon. I believe in you..."

It's a little risky to trust Raisa, though..."

Djimon-san is awful!

<blank>

The next morning after the knights arrived in Amkam and dawned.

With the clear morning sun and the birds singing, the Amcam House was already filled with the hustle and bustle of many people.

It may be reminiscent of the time when this structure was once used as a castle.

<blank>

It was still early in the morning, and a swarthy voice was echoing in a room of the Amcam House.

<blank>

What can I say? Are you going to settle for a force of that size? Do you want these nameless men to join the Order?"

But, you know, these are the best we have at the moment," he said. Besides, they are not inferior to the grade holders.

"Hmmm! What good is a man whose name no one knows? The people do not want such a person! Do you agree? Representative Houllier!

<blank>

Mm," said Connor Clark, to which Cameron Houllier nodded with a stern look on his face.

<blank>

<blank>

This is the third conference room on the ground floor of the Amcam House.

In this room, about a third of the way down the council chambers, men were discussing the issues.

<blank>

One is Cameron Fourier, a delegation representative who arrived yesterday.

And another, Connor Clark, who also assists the delegation's representative.

It's a discussion with the three families of Amcam and Howard Cloud for the departure of the survey team.

<blank>

Now, both Cameron Fourier and Connor Clark were complaining that the forces provided by Amcam were not enough.

The village head, August Dulles, explained the current situation and attempted to admonish him.

<blank>

"...It's not the people who don't want it, it's you.

Silence! Silence!"

<blank>

Silence Croquis spits venom as if muttering.

Alphonse Beers admonishes him for that.

<blank>

Howard Cloud just quietly listened to their discussion.

<blank>

"If you want to put someone with a grade...A or above, you'll have to wait another month, won't you?"

You still intend to wait a month? We have already spent nearly three months since we left King's Landing! The people want a resolution as soon as possible! Are you asking me to extend the people's anxieties for another month?

<blank>

August's words caused Connor Clark to stand up and raise his voice.

<blank>

Then you can go on your own."

I told you to stop, Silence.

<blank>

Silence muttering venom again.

Conor Clark, perhaps hearing this, glanced nervously at Silence.

<blank>

What do you mean when you say that almost all of the top management is absent? Is there a flaw in the management system?

<blank>

Cameron Houllier won Connor Clark over with a hand and in a quiet tone questioned Amcam's management system.

<blank>

<blank>

'To begin with! More than half of the grade holders are out of the country at the request of the government! Don't you realize that it is the government's responsibility?

We don't have jurisdiction over such things! It's not our place to tell the survey team what to do! What I'm asking you now is what you intend to do with the forces you need!

<blank>

Silence voiced that he couldn't stand it.

Conor Kurer bites into it.

<blank>

Don't make me say it again! Grade holders won't be back until a month from now!"

It is your duty to do something about it, isn't it? The agreement you made with the kingdom! Do you intend to fulfill it?

"...! You bring that up now? We've already provided you with enough power and technology!

Hmph! Isn't it rude of me to be so rude to you? I can't feel any respect at all in your attitude toward the representative of Fourier! Mr. Fourier is of the lineage of that General Valdemonte! In this day and age, he should have a knighthood! You can see that at ......!!!!"

"Hmph! No one in Amkham hangs his head over his bloodline!"

Tch! It is often said that 'frontier blood is thin'...!"

Don't hear a lot of 'central blood is savory' either!"

! What...? You dare to criticize the kingdom?

"That's enough, Mr. Clark."

Silence! That's enough!

<blank>

Fourier held Clark's hand as he stood up, and Alphonse put his hand on Silence's shoulder, admonishing them for their repeated exchange of words.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard, who had been quietly watching, slowly opened his mouth.

<blank>

The people at ......10th are not enough. Is that what you're saying?"

Of course, of course. Only if the most prestigious people are on their way will this investigation be successful. Naturally, the people will be relieved.

<blank>

Cameron Fourier gulps for a moment as the pressure of Howard's gaze presses down on him.

However, in an attempt to push back his trepidation, he immediately leaned forward and appealed for his own needs.

At some point, Fourier had a thin sheen of sweat on his forehead.

<blank>

He said he didn't have time to waste. He wants to leave immediately. Is that what you're saying?

<blank>

An even stronger light illuminates Howard's eyes.

<blank>

I am afraid that I am not sure. It has already been nearly a year since the anomaly occurred.... For the sake of the people, I think we should head for the Great Forest as soon as possible.

<blank>

Fourier was about to open his mouth again when he realized his lips were thirsty.

Clumsily licking his lips and swallowing his spit, he answered Howard's question while holding his twitching throat.

Next to him, Clark's eyes widened at the pressure of the strong man he was being subjected to for the first time in his life, and he froze, unable to catch his breath.

<blank>

The air in the room was heavy and seemed to stretch over my body.

<blank>

<blank>

I see... I see what you mean! Then I'll get it!

<blank>

Howard, however, seemed to pay no attention to the state of the room, and said nothing at all.

<blank>

What? Is that...?

Gokouzu! What?

You're out of your mind, Head!

Gokusho! Wait for me!

<blank>

Fourier gulps at Howard's words, and August, Silence, and Alphonse object with wide eyes.

<blank>

"Am I not strong enough? Mr. Fourier?

What a shame! What is there to complain about having Sir Cloud, the "Iron God" heard at the sound, go to battle with us!

<blank>

Then it's settled. We will leave in three days. In the meantime, I will make preparations as quickly as possible.

Your Highness! Please wait! Think again!

No, don't worry, August. It's been a long time since I've been away! Silence! Alphonse! Let's start getting ready!

<blank>

While Fourier was puzzled and August was trying to stop him, Howard's voice was soaring.

<blank>

Give it up, August, there's no stopping the oligarch now.

But! What are you going to tell the ...... Mistress?

<blank>

Silence, who gave up trying to persuade Howard early on, appeases August, but August expresses concern for Sonia.

<blank>

I am sorry August. This is my last ego... and I will speak to Sonia."

"...go, your head ......"

<blank>

Placing his hand on August's shoulder, Howard tells him quietly.

Feeling the warmth of his shoulders, August clasped his hands together in frustration.

<blank>

"My Lord Fourier, you must be mindful of the rest of your personnel! Irosio is an extraordinary magical place. Make sure they recover their strength!"

"...is. Thank you very much for your consideration.

August! Silence! Alphonse! Prepare for the search for Irosio! We leave in three days, on the 29th of the second month!

<blank>

That day, Howard Cloud made the decision to launch the survey team.



<blank>

----------------

I am sure you have traveled a long way, Mr. Meyer. Tonight, you will be well rested!"

Thank you, Sir Cloud. On behalf of the entire unit, I thank you."

I have received the letter from Rheinwald! I have indeed received the letter from Reinwald. I will not inconvenience you during your stay in Amkam."

Ha! I am sorry, sir. The Commander of the Order has asked me to convey his regards to Sir Cloud."

"Well, Reinwald Kleiner, I'm glad to see you are in good health. If you guys need anything else during your stay, just let me know.

Thank you very much. I believe you already know the three members of our advance team who are here. If you need anything else, these men, myself, or my deputy, Kyle Irvine, will be your point of contact.

I'll be in touch with you! Good luck, Lord Irvine!"

Hail! My name is Kyle Irvine and I am the Assistant Director. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"At ......, I hear that Lord Irvine is the finest knight in this troop?"

No, I am still a young man..."

'Mm! You have humility, too? Good! How about we have a hand-to-hand combat after the feast?"

Are you sure you don't want to... later?

Yes! Reinwald has asked me to take care of anyone who has something to see! The sooner, the better, right?"

Is that so?

What? After a long journey, it's just a light game! You might even sleep better. Hmm?

Yes... yes.

Hmmm...I guess we'll see tomorrow morning! Tomorrow morning would be good for a full-scale meeting! Mm-mm-mm! Let's enjoy it to the fullest tomorrow morning! Hey, Mister Irvine! Irvine-dono! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

"...... is ........."

Oh, that unit leader. Sir Cloud..., isn't something unusual and scary...?"

Raisa," he said, "keep your voice down! Sir can hear you."

"Ah, I think there's a huge black aura rising from Sir Cloud!

This is what I call the XO's karmic retribution. He got what he deserved."

Hiiiiii! I think Sir Cloud's eyes are glowing red...? Is it my imagination?

Apparently, the XO's greeting caught the attention of Lord Cloud.

Mr. Djimon... then the XO... Ah! Sir's aura has swelled even more ah!"

Look at the battalion commander... He has already decided to take the XO out of sight and out of mind. We mustn't turn our eyes on him either! Good!"

"Ahhh... I'm sorry to hear that, XO. It's just something that came out of me..."
