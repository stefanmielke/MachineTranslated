"How's it going? How's the equipment I sent you?"

Yes, it's great! The power and defense increased many times! Everyone in AMCAM is using this, right?"

Tin's is a one-of-a-kind prototype, so it's better than the others, but I think everyone else's is just as good."

I see... ......, but still! If everyone is using this, I'm not afraid of an 'overflow'! I'm sure a lot of people can reach the shallows of the forest."

Shallow layers are no longer a threat.

Wow, that's great, that's amazing! You have systematized magic, haven't you? Amkam is getting stronger and stronger, isn't he!

<blank>

'With the help of that High Elf, we were able to secure the etheric archive and record it there,' he said.

So now everyone can use the magic that we used to use."

Yes, because they systematized it, along with the magic that originally existed in this world."

<blank>

The magic we've been able to use since we came to this world is based on a story we came up with together when we were little,...... right?"

Yeah, most of the stuff we thought up back then.

Our fantasies have become reality. ......

That's what magic is all about. High imagery and strong willpower create reality.

"Have we ...... changed ...... this world ............?"

<blank>

Tin. If you're saying you feel responsible for this, that's because you're wrong. It's not Tin's fault that this happened."

But it makes no difference that we are changing the world. But it doesn't make any difference that we are changing the world, and what we are going to do now is also ......"

Tin has no responsibility. Tin has no responsibility. I'll take care of all that. Didn't I tell you that at the beginning?"

"......, Mr. Toll."

<blank>

But that doesn't matter. The ship is finished.

Huh?"

With Oceano's help, we've secured passage. This time we can go directly there!"

Really?

He said, "Yeah, we'll be sailing by the end of the month. You've kept us waiting a long time."

Really?" ...... Really! You said before that it would be within a year, and now it's stretched six months!"

I'm sorry about that. The boat turned out to be a bigger deal than I thought. ......"

I know. I know you've been working hard, Thor."

But we're talking about two months, since we'll be going around the open sea. Still, we will see Tin in about three months."

"...... so three months to go...... hmmm, we're in the middle of summer!"

Oh, oh, oh! I'll be spending my midsummer vacation on a boat this year!"

Oh, that's so slippery! That's soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool!"

I'll give you a little ride on the boat when we get there."

Really? Hmm, I promise, right?"

Yeah, I got it.

"Yeah, ...... glad to hear it."

Sorry to keep you waiting.

...... Yeah, I had to wait."

Just hold on a little longer."

Yes, I'm waiting. I'll be waiting for you. It's okay, Thor.

"...... tin"

I'll be fine, I'll be waiting for you, ...... Thor you. It's okay."

Earlier in the week, I invited Karen to join me for a morning amcam workout.

<blank>

Initially, Karen had also woken up when I was getting up early in the morning, and I had apologized for waking her up, but she had said that she used to get up around this time even when she was in her hometown.

Recently, I have come to realize that Karen also likes to be physically active, so I asked her if she would like to run with me starting today. I asked her if she would like to run with me.

<blank>

Then I said, "What? Can I go with you?" And Karen's biting answer was more than I expected.

Seeing Karen happily changing into her training clothes makes me think that I was right to invite her.

<blank>

I found out after running with her that Karen's legs and feet were still quite hammered!

This is not only Bibi and Mia, but also Irving, I think.

<blank>

I knew I should let Alicia take care of this place.

After all, Alicia is the toughest sister in the AMCAM group, having already taken the advanced class of "Iron Knuckle" fighting in the Kuken Department!

<blank>

<blank>

So, after the run was over, I left Karen with this Alicia, as I had originally planned.

<blank>

After introducing themselves to each other, they began to do some light kumite to confirm their respective kata. After a while, both of them were exchanging kicks and thrusts, looking like they were having a lot of fun.

<blank>

Are they compatible with each other? Do they have something in common?

<blank>

Honestly, I've never seen Karen looking this happy before. I knew she was definitely a battler, right? Definitely!

<blank>

Not only Bibi and Mia, but also Irving and even Davis, who had started participating in morning training the other day, looked at each other with a surprised look on their faces.

<blank>

I asked Irvin if he wanted to try it out and see if he could stand up to Karen and he said, "No, if I were unarmed, I probably wouldn't win. ......". Seriously?

Mr. Davis looked truly surprised at Irving's words, too.

<blank>

Irving! Come over here for a minute!"

<blank>

As if she had heard this conversation, Alicia called out to Irving. Irving straightened his back for a moment when he was called, but then he gave a small sigh of resignation and went straight toward Alicia.

<blank>

This girl, Karen, has almost no experience in interpersonal training.

...... Yes, I'm embarrassed to say that for the last five or six years I've only trained alone."

And he says he has no experience in kumite with an opponent with a weapon.

Oh, oh.

<blank>

Alicia looks very happy and Karen looks a little shy.

Irving hears this and responds shortly, as if to say, "Oh, I know what they're going to make me do.

<blank>

Let's start with Irving, shall we? I'll show you how it's done! Karen is watching me, okay?

Hi! Alicia senior!"

<blank>

I don't know, the distance between the two of us is getting a lot closer, isn't it?

Alicia instructs Irving to swing his sword down there.

<blank>

Irving raises his sword as if to say, "Good grief!" and "Get fired up!" Alicia's fiery voice shouts. Suddenly, Irving takes up his sword in a spirited stance.

<blank>

When the two are poised, "Okay," says Alicia, and Irving makes his move with an eye contact.

<blank>

Irving swung his sword down quickly. Alicia shifted her body slightly and handled that sword with her right hand in a casual movement, and the next moment, Alicia's left elbow was buried in Irving's right side.

<blank>

"Ugh!"

<blank>

Irving collapses on the spot, clutching his side as he lets out such a funny sound.

<blank>

Well, it's like this! Take your time at first, but be precise with your shapes."

Hi!"

I'm not going to let you do this! Irving, get up and get ready!"

Please say hello." Mr. Haggard!"

"...... Oh, oh."

<blank>

For now, let's do about 50 of these this morning."

Yes!"

When you get the shape, I'll teach you the next one."

Hi!"

In AMCAM, there are not only swords, but also spears, axes, and daggers, so you can learn them all!"

Hi! Thank you! Alicia senior!

<blank>

Alicia's words were met with a twitch from Dana, Lombardo and Carla.

Is Alicia going to let Karen play "Amcam Juban"?

<blank>

Well, I'm glad Karen seems to be having fun.

Really, I never thought I would be here to see the moment when athletic seniors and juniors are formed.
