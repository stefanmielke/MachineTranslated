“How is it? How’s the gear I sent?”

“Yeah, it’s amazing! My strength and defense have suddenly multiplied by several times! Everyone in Amukamu is using this too, right?”

“Yeah, well, yours is a one-of-a-kind prototype, so it’s better than the others, but everyone else’s is similar in performance.”

“I see... Even so! If everyone is using something like this, we don’t have to be afraid of the ‘Overflow’! I think quite a few people can reach the shallow layers of the forest, right?”

“Yeah, the shallow layers are no longer a threat.”

“Wow, that’s incredible! The magic has been systematized too, right? Amukamu is getting stronger and stronger!”

<b>

“With the cooperation of that High Elf, we were able to secure the Ether Archive and record information there.”

“So now everyone can use the magic we were using.”

“Exactly. It was systematized along with the magic that originally existed in this world.”

<b>

“...The magic we’ve been able to use since we came to this world is based on the stories we created when we were little, right?”

“That’s right. Most of what we thought of back then is what we’re using now.”

“Our imagination has become reality...”

“That’s how magic works. A strong imagination and willpower create reality.”

“...Did we... change this world...?”

<b>

“Suzu. If you’re feeling responsible, that’s misplaced. It’s not your fault.”

“But it’s true that we’re changing this world. What we’re trying to do from now on...”

“You have no responsibility. You don’t need to carry that burden. I’ll take care of all of it. I said that from the beginning, didn’t I?”

“...Thorl-kun.”

<b>

“More importantly, the ship is finished.”

“Eh?”

“We’ve secured the route with the help of Oceanus. This time, we can go directly there!”

“Really?!”

“Yeah, we’re planning to set sail within this month. I’ve kept you waiting for a long time.”

“Really? ...It’s true! You said it would be within a year before, but it got extended by six months!”

“I’m sorry. The ship turned out to be more elaborate than I thought...”

“Yeah, I understand. I know you’ve been working hard, Thorl-kun.”

“But since we’ll be going around the open sea, it’ll take about two months. Still, I’ll be able to see you in about three months.”

“...Right, three more months... Hehe, right in the middle of summer!”

“Y-Yeah! This year, I’ll spend my summer vacation on the ship!”

“Ah! That’s so unfair!”

“Haha, once we get there, I’ll let you ride the ship for a bit.”

“Really? Hehe, it’s a promise, okay?”

“Yeah, leave it to me.”

“Okay... I’m happy.”

“Thanks for waiting.”

“...Yeah, I’ve been waiting.”

“Just a little longer, please wait.”

“Yeah, I’ll wait. I’ll keep waiting. It’s okay, Thorl-kun.”

“...Suzu.”

“It’s okay, I’ll be waiting... Thorl-kun. It’s okay.”

<b>

This morning, I invited Karen to join the morning training at Amukamu.

<b>

At first, I thought I might have woken her up when I got up early, but she said, “I used to wake up around this time when I was back home.”

Recently, I’ve come to understand that Karen also enjoys moving her body, so I invited her to run together starting today.

<b>

Then she replied, “Huh? Is it okay for me to go with you?” with more enthusiasm than I expected.

Watching Karen happily change into her training clothes made me feel that inviting her was definitely the right choice.

<b>

After running together, I realized that Karen’s legs and hips were quite impressive!

She’s not just on par with Vivi and Mia; she might even surpass Irvin.

<b>

I think it’s best to leave this to Alicia.

After all, Alicia is already in the advanced class of martial arts called “Iron Knuckle” in the Empty Fist Department, making her the toughest sister in Amukamu!

<b>

<b>

So, after finishing our run, I left Karen in Alicia’s care as originally planned.

<b>

After the two introduced themselves, they started light sparring to check each other’s forms. Before long, both were having a great time exchanging kicks and punches.

<b>

Are these two really compatible? Is there some kind of connection between them?

<b>

Honestly, this is the first time I’ve seen Karen look so happy. She’s definitely a battle-type person, right?! No doubt about it!!

<b>

Of course, Vivi and Mia, as well as Irvin and Davis, who just started joining the morning practice, were watching their sparring with surprised expressions.

<b>

When I asked Irvin if he wanted to spar with Karen, he said, “No, if it’s unarmed, I probably wouldn’t win...” Seriously?!

Irvin’s words left Davis looking genuinely shocked.

<b>

“Irvin! Come over here for a second!”

<b>

Just as if she had heard that conversation, Alicia called Irvin over. Irvin straightened up for a moment when called, but then sighed softly as if giving up and walked over to Alicia.

<b>

“This girl, Karen, has hardly any experience in combat training.”

“...Yes, it’s a bit embarrassing, but for the past five to six years, I’ve only trained alone.”

“And she says she has no experience sparring with someone wielding a weapon.”

“Y-Yeah.”

<b>

Alicia was chatting excitedly, while Karen looked a bit embarrassed.

Listening to them, Irvin seemed to want to say, “Oh, I see what’s going to happen.”

<b>

“Let’s try sparring with Irvin first, okay? For now, I’ll show you a demonstration! Karen, make sure to watch closely, okay?!”

“Yes! Alicia-senpai!!”

<b>

It seems like the distance between the two has suddenly shrunk, hasn’t it?!

Alicia is instructing Irvin to swing his sword down.

<b>

As Irvin raises his sword, looking like he wants to say, “Here we go,” Alicia shouts, “Focus!” Instantly, Irvin takes a stance filled with energy.

<b>

Once they’re both ready, Irvin moves at Alicia’s signal.

<b>

Irvin swings his sword down quickly. As Alicia slightly shifts her body, she effortlessly deflects his sword with her right hand, and in the next moment, Alicia’s left elbow is buried in Irvin’s right side.

<b>

“Ugh!”

<b>

With that strange sound, Irvin collapses on the spot, holding his side.

<b>

“Well, that’s how it goes! Start slowly, but make sure your form is accurate.”

“Yes!”

“Come on! Irvin, get up and get ready!”

“Nice to meet you! Haggard-kun!”

“...Y-Yeah.”

<b>

“For now, let’s try doing about 50 of these this morning.”

“Yes!”

“Once you can get the form down, I’ll teach you the next step.”

“Yes!”

“In Amukamu, there are also spear users, axe users, and dagger users, so you can learn a bit of everything!”

“Yes! Thank you very much! Alicia-senpai!!”

<b>

At Alicia’s words, Dana, Lombard, and Carla reacted slightly.

Is Alicia planning to have Karen do the “Ten Battles of Amukamu” too?

<b>

Well, I’m glad Karen looks happy.

Honestly, I never expected to witness the moment when a sports club-like senior-junior relationship would form in a place like this.
