# 191 Episode 191 Subject of Escort

In other words, it's a 'magic-generating organism' come to life!"

<blank>

The person speaking while twirling a test tube in his hand is Dr. Nosoli Casbal, professor of "Magical Biology.

The teacher was very excited and seemed to be in a good mood.

<blank>

However! Once established, it takes in the host's flesh and blood, or even the etheric body, and grows its magical body, transforming the host's very being.

<blank>

The liquid in the test tube was slightly cloudy white, and every time it shook, something sparkled inside, sprinkling a small light.

This glitter is apparently the seed of a "magic-generating organism.

It is said that they "germinate" by feeding on a small amount of magical power of the people who take them in.

The liquid itself is also dangerous enough, and ingesting it is suicide, according to the doctor.

<blank>

Dr. Nosoli is now in possession of an illegal drug called "Back Door" as an example.

The teachers were asked to analyze Kore.

<blank>

Just as the results of the analysis were being compiled, the doctor came to us and happily told us about this "illegal drug.

What brought me here in the first place is that I came to ....... I came to greet the "target of the escort" requested by the school's chairman. ......

<blank>

But as soon as he entered the room, Dr. Nosoli said, "This is clearly an artificial entity! However, the more I investigate how it was created, the more I am intrigued! The more I investigate how it was created, the more I am intrigued! The more I investigate how it was created, the more I am intrigued!

<blank>

Huh? Was this teacher always this intense? ......

Dr. Morris Baltasar, author of "Structural Geology," said, "Nosoli, you're so excited! You're so excited, aren't you? Only for you, Nosoli! I don't know what he meant.

Bibi and Mia, who came with me, are used to it and are looking at the teacher quite coolly, but Karen and Miss Cordelia, who came here for the first time, are naturally a bit taken back.

<blank>

<blank>

This morning, the chairman of the board of directors said, "Reports are coming in that the analysis we requested has been done, so you should go and ask about it.

If so, "I'll go there after school," I replied to the chairman of the board.

<blank>

When I told everyone about it in the cafeteria during lunch break, not only Bibi and Mia, but even Irving and Lombardo said they would go.

And somehow, Karen, who was listening to the conversation on the side, and Miss Cordelia and her two attendants, who were following her, were also there!

As a result, we were forced to come in as a large group, as many as nine people.

After all, everyone seems to have a certain amount of interest in the "illegal drugs" in question.

<blank>

But the room was supposed to be quite spacious, but it feels much smaller than before.

Hasn't this been a lot of luggage since you were here last time?

What's with all those old books with a mysterious aura?

Is that a specimen? Is that a formalin-soaked specimen? Some of them are bigger than my height.

What about the stones and rocks of various colors and sizes lying randomly here and there? Don't they catch your feet and make you fall?

<blank>

I don't know why so many of you are here, but it feels pretty small, doesn't it? "This! Such a large number of customers...? Tea! Tea! But in the end, it was Norman Lance, who was supposed to be the teacher's escort as usual, who made the tea.

<blank>

Norman, you look a little tired.

It seems that the number of items in his luggage increased at a rate that Mr. Norman could not keep up with.

What is Dr. Joseline, the self-proclaimed doctor's assistant, doing?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When it enters the host's body, it takes on a fine, thread-like form, supplementing the host's nervous tissue and even strengthening its muscles. Moreover, if the host's body is damaged, it repairs itself!

<blank>

The tension was high and Dr. Nosoli's narrative continued.

<blank>

It is much like certain kinds of bugs that parasitize the bodies of magical beasts, says the teacher.

The bugs are host to magical beasts, and when their bodies are wounded, they repair the wounds.

Low-level bugs can do little more than close wounds and stop bleeding at best, but some of them can heal wounds instantly and even replace missing parts of the body.

<blank>

They repair the host's body for coexistence, whereas they prey upon the host and ultimately cause its death!

<blank>

Most of the corpses in the morgue that turned into undetected were not addicts? The doctors believe that most of them were addicts.

I have heard that even after the body of an undette was cut in half, the body was connected and started moving again. It's absolutely horrifying.

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmm, but it can't sustain its own existence if it is subjected to powerful external magic, can it?

The original is like this dust. If you can handle magic power normally, even if you take it into your body, these guys don't exist!

"Well, the drug is a big reason why there are so many addicts in the city, especially in the slums, where there are many people who cannot handle magic.

<blank>

According to Professor Seiwashi Melchio of "Magickal Mechanics," they are surprisingly fragile because their existence itself is uncertain as a substance.

The amount contained in them is so miniscule that a person who can handle magic power normally would not be affected even if he or she took in five or six bottles at once.

However, he also said that the base solution itself is a dangerous enough drug that if one were to ingest that much at one time, he would probably not survive due to poisoning symptoms.

<blank>

"But we've found quite a few that look like they've been eaten to pieces."

<blank>

Dr. Nosoli also suggested the possibility of cannibalism of parasitic individuals.

Although there is no proof, there is a possibility that some of the parasites may have more parasites in their bodies and try to increase their power by feeding on other individuals.

<blank>

Such individuals can be very troublesome, he says, because their power itself will be greatly increased and their durability will also increase.

Isn't the vampire in the example an entity that has increased its power in that way? And.

<blank>

Hm, but even if it has grown enough, if powerful magic power or strong holy energy is poured directly into the host's body all at once, it will cease to exist, won't it?

<blank>

According to what I heard, Alicia slammed her knee spike, which was covered with "Ki", into her opponent's chest and crushed it there.

Normally, a low-ranked vampire would have been killed with a single blow that would have crushed his heart.

But in the teachers' opinion, they say, the unyo in the body must have immediately repaired and reinforced the damaged body.

<blank>

In order to completely destroy it, they say, it is necessary to directly inject holy chi or other powerful magical power into the body.

<blank>

If Alicia had driven the knee spike completely into her chest like a stake and then poured Ki into it, she would have been able to finish him off without any problem, wouldn't she? She also said that if Alicia had driven the knee spike completely into her chest like a stake and then poured Ki into it, she would have finished him off without any problem.

<blank>

Or, from the outside, burn it all up at once with a high-temperature flame.

It seems that the process that Arrows went through was indeed the right one.

<blank>

When Irvin heard this, he thought something over.

Certainly the Haggards are skilled in handling powerful holy chi.

And they say that the only wound that Irving had made didn't show any sign of repair.

However, he said with regret that the sword did not pass through properly.

<blank>

I knew I ain't got enough power. ......

<blank>

Irving is mumbling.

I guess the only way to do this is to improve your groundwork. If you want to train, I'll go along with you.

Well, there are some things that temporarily increase the attack power, loa type skills. ...... Hom, I don't know what to do.

<blank>

<blank>

Karen and Miss Cordelia and the others also had hardened expressions at the mention of drugs and hosts.

It is not unreasonable to think that these children have directly confronted the thing and experienced its fearlessness firsthand.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Hm, sometimes you guys seem to have some interesting stuff."

<blank>

Hah? Hahi?

<blank>

Mistress Cordilia is making a bare-bones voice that is not unladylike.

Dr. Seywash suddenly turned to Miss Cordelia and approached her face.

Well, if a beautiful elf came up to you with her beautiful, well-shaped face, your adolescent daughter's heart would probably leap out of her chest.

<blank>

"What's the matter, Mr. Seiwashi? I can't believe that a teacher... would be interested in a female student.

<blank>

"Hmm, you seem to be carrying something a little unusual on your chest."

These magic waves are ...... pretty high purity lobe crystals, aren't they?"

"Oh, I'd like to take a look if you don't mind."

<blank>

The teachers seemed interested in what Miss Cordilia had in her possession.

When I asked her if she had anything with her, Miss Cordelia pulled out a brooch from her breast pocket and showed it to me.

Is it made of silver? It's a brooch with a golden stone about three centimeters long that sits on a silver base that looks like ivy woven into a heart shape.

<blank>

Oh, your father gave it to me. I can't put it on my uniform, so I keep it in my bosom like this.

<blank>

At the request of the teachers, who asked to see a little of it, Miss Cordelia begrudgingly held out the brooch.

Do not break it, teachers, okay? I'm talking about Miss Cordelia's precious things. If you do anything strange with it, I will be very angry.

<blank>

I know what I'm doing. ......Whoa, this is a rare one."

"That's definitely the one, Terrill's ......"

Hmm, the odds are about one in five. ......

<blank>

The teachers each take a brooch in their hands and say ah-ha! Do the teachers know what it is?

<blank>

I'm sorry.

He showed me something rare. Take good care of it.

The person you sent it to seems to think very highly of you. Please don't let him or her worry about you.

<blank>

I'm going to go to ...... and say, "Oh, yes. Thank you ......."

<blank>

Perhaps satisfied, the teachers gently returned the brooch to Miss Cordilia.

Hom, it seems that you took better care of it than I expected. Does that mean it was a valuable item?

Miss Cordilia's eyes widened somewhat when she received the brooch, perhaps surprised by the teachers' treatment of it.

Afterward, he held the brooch that had come back to him so dearly on his chest, probably thinking of the person who had given it to him, in response to the teacher's words.

<blank>

"Hmmm! Looks like you're wearing something unusual too!"

Yes? Yes?

<blank>

Dr. Seiwashi, now glumly, thrust his face toward Karen!

Karen would be so surprised. She responds in a funny voice.

<blank>

"Oh, this is another unusual sign! This is another unusual sign."

"Hmm? This ...... seems to contain a small amount of divine energy!"

Hm? Besides that, you're wearing something else. This is very faintly ...... faint..."

Aaaaahhhh! Teachers...! It's time to go!

<blank>

Oooh! Surprise!

Dr. Joseline suddenly shouted out as she placed the teacup she was holding on the table with a clatter and looked at the hall clock on the wall.

At his loud voice, everyone is startled and turns to look at the assistant teacher.

<blank>

"Oh my God! The time for the debriefing is approaching!

Hm, I think there's still time."

What are you talking about? The debriefing starts at 5:00 p.m! It's already a little before 4pm! Please hurry up.......! Lord Goldberg is waiting for you...!

I think it's time to start getting ready, and I think we'll be ready in time.

I'm always saying things like that... and I'm always late! When I'm late, Mr. Sheldon always scolds me!

You always rush around at the end of the day, scattering papers and documents around, don't you? You deserve it, don't you?"

"Ahhhhh...! I don't care about that! Hurryーーーprepare yourselfーー! Ahhh! You all have reports scattered all over the place! Please help me collect them!

<blank>

Whoa, what's all the flapping all of a sudden?

I can't help but feel that Dr. Joseline is the only one who is jittery about something. ......

Well, being scolded by Mrs. Sheldon is certainly scary.

<blank>

So, after everyone hurriedly gathered up the documents that looked like reports scattered on the tables and floor and handed them to the teachers, we were all thrown out of the room with a pop-poy by Dr. Joseline.

<blank>

"Todayーー・Thank you for your hard workーー! See you tomorrow on campus!

<blank>

The door was closed like a storm, and we were stunned.

It was odd to see Mr. Norman bowing his head apologetically behind the door.

<blank>

"Come on, teachers! Let's get ready for our departure! ............ Aigi-Peko!"

Jo, Joseline? Why are you head over heels for the specimen? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! If you don't pull it out soon, she'll suffocate!

Oh, no! A specimen of a rare magical beast! What are you doing? You little assistant!

What are you doing to a precious mineral specimen? What are you doing to my precious mineral specimens? Your report is covered in specimen solution!"

"Hmmm, so we end up in the same pattern as usual.

<blank>

Dongaragashaan! and a tremendous sound came from behind the door.

Immediately after, Mr. Norman, in a great hurry, and the reprimanding voices of the teachers echoed from inside the door.

<blank>

Are you okay with ......? Dr. Joseline .......
