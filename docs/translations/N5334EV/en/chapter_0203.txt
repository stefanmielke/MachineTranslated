# Episode 191: Target of Protection

"One could say this is a failed attempt at becoming a 'magic power generating creature'!"

<b>

Spinning a test tube in hand, the one speaking is Professor Nosori Kasubaru of 'Magical Biology'.

The professor seems quite high-spirited and thoroughly engaged.

<b>

"However! Once it establishes itself, it will absorb not only the host's blood and flesh but even their etheric body, growing its magical power and altering the very existence of the host!"

<b>

The liquid inside the test tube is slightly cloudy and sparkles as it sways, as if something inside is scattering tiny lights.

This sparkle seems to be something akin to the seed of a 'magic power generating creature'.

It is said to 'germinate' by feeding on the minute magical power of the human it has absorbed.

The liquid itself is a dangerous substance, and the professor states that consuming it is akin to a suicidal act.

<b>

What Professor Nosori is currently holding is the infamous illegal drug known as 'Back Door'.

It seems the faculty had been commissioned to analyze this.

<b>

Just as the analysis results were being compiled, we arrived, and the professor was excitedly discussing this 'illegal drug' with us.

The reason we happened to come at such a time is that we were asked by the academy's chairman to greet the 'target of protection'...

<b>

However, as soon as we entered the room, Professor Nosori exclaimed, "This is clearly an artificial entity! But! The more I investigate how it was generated, the more my interest is piqued!" in a strange tone.

<b>

Huh? Was this professor always this energetic...?

Professor Morris Baltasar of 'Structural Geology' remarked, "Nosori-kun, you're so excited! You're really into this, aren't you?! Just like you, Nosori-kun!" saying something nonsensical.

Bibi and Mia, who came with me, are quite accustomed to this and are observing the professor with a cool demeanor, but Karen and Lady Cordelia, who are here for the first time, are understandably taken aback.

<b>

<b>

This morning, the chairman said, "I've received a report that the analysis results you requested are in, so it would be good to hear about it while you're at it."

So I replied to the chairman, "I'll go after school."

<b>

Then, during lunch in the cafeteria, when I shared this with everyone, Bibi and Mia, of course, and even Irvin and Lombard said they would go.

Furthermore, for some reason, Karen, who was listening to the conversation, along with Lady Cordelia and her two attendants, decided to join in!

As a result, we ended up with a large group of nine people showing up.

It seems everyone has a certain level of interest in the aforementioned 'illegal drug'.

<b>

But even though it should be a fairly spacious room, it somehow feels much smaller than before?

Hasn't the amount of stuff increased since the last time we came?

What are all those suspiciously glowing old books?

Are those specimens? Like formalin-preserved ones? There are several that are taller than me?

Various stones and rocks of different colors are scattered haphazardly everywhere. Won't someone trip over those?

<b>

Given that we barged in with this many people, it feels quite cramped, doesn't it? "W-what is this—so many—customers—?! Tea! Tea—!" while saying this, Professor Joseline Joslan was flustered, but in the end, it was Norman Lance, who is supposed to be the faculty's bodyguard, who made the tea as usual.

<b>

Norman looks a bit tired.

It seems that the amount of stuff has increased at a pace that Norman can't keep up with.

What exactly is the self-proclaimed assistant, Professor Joseline, doing?

<b>

<b>

<b>

"When it enters the host's body, it takes on a thread-like form, supplementing the host's nerve tissue and even enhancing their strength. Moreover, if the host's body is damaged, it will repair it!"

<b>

With his energy still high, Professor Nosori continued his explanation.

He stated that this is quite similar to certain types of insects that parasitize magical beasts.

These insects use magical beasts as hosts and repair their injuries when the host is wounded.

While low-level insects can at most stop bleeding by sealing wounds, there are some that can instantly heal injuries and even compensate for missing body parts.

<b>

"While those creatures repair the host's body for coexistence, these ones firmly feed on the host and ultimately lead them to death!"

<b>

The professors suspect that most of the corpses found in the morgue, which had turned into undead, were habitual users of this substance. There are even stories of undead being cut in half yet still rejoining and moving again. It's truly horrifying.

<b>

<b>

"Hmm, however, if they receive a powerful magical force from the outside, they cannot maintain their existence."

"Their original state is so pitiful. If someone can handle magic normally, they won't exist even if they are absorbed into the body!"

"Hmm, the fact that the drug has created habitual users primarily in the slums, where many cannot handle magic, is a significant reason."

<b>

According to Professor Seiwashi Melchio of 'Magical Dynamics', these creatures are surprisingly fragile because their existence as a substance is uncertain.

Since the amount contained is extremely minute, if someone who can handle magic normally were to absorb about five or six of them at once, they would likely have no effect.

However, the base solution itself is a sufficiently dangerous chemical, so consuming that much at once would likely lead to poisoning symptoms, he added.

<b>

"However, quite a number of individuals that appear to have been eaten away have been discovered."

<b>

Professor Nosori also suggested the possibility of cannibalism among the parasitic entities.

While there is no certainty, he stated that there might be individuals that consume other entities to host more parasites within their bodies and increase their power.

<b>

Such individuals would significantly increase their strength and durability, making them a very troublesome existence.

Could the vampire in question be one that gained power in such a way?

<b>

"Hmm, however, even if they have grown sufficiently, if a powerful magical force or strong holy energy is poured directly into the host's body, they will cease to exist."

<b>

From what I've heard, Alicia struck the opponent's chest with a knee spike enveloped in 'ki', crushing that area.

Normally, that single blow should have been enough to crush the heart of a low-level vampire.

However, according to the professors, the squirming entities inside the body likely repaired the damaged flesh immediately.

<b>

To completely eradicate this, it is necessary to directly inject holy energy or powerful magical force into the body.

<b>

If Alicia had completely driven the knee spike into the chest like driving a stake and then channeled 'ki', she would have been able to take it down without issue, they said.

<b>

Alternatively, from the outside, one could completely incinerate it with high-temperature flames.

It seems that the method Arrows used was indeed correct.

<b>

Upon hearing this, Irvin fell into deep thought.

Indeed, members of the Haggard family are skilled at handling powerful holy energy.

It is said that only the wounds inflicted by Irvin did not show signs of healing.

However, he lamented that his sword could not penetrate properly.

<b>

"I guess I'm just not strong enough..."

<b>

Irvin muttered.

In this case, the only option is to increase one's base strength. I can accompany him if he wants to train.

Well, there are temporary skills that can boost attack power, but... Hmm, what should we do?

<b>

<b>

Karen and Lady Cordelia also had serious expressions regarding the discussion of drugs and hosts.

Thinking about it, these girls have directly faced that horror and experienced it firsthand, so it's no wonder they react this way.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hmm, by the way, it seems you have something interesting with you."

<b>

"Huh? Huh?!"

<b>

Lady Cordelia let out an unladylike yelp.

Professor Seiwashi suddenly leaned in closer to Lady Cordelia.

Well, if a handsome elf suddenly brought their beautifully arranged face close, it's no surprise that a girl in her adolescence would have her heart race.

<b>

"What is it, Professor Seiwashi?! I can't believe you're interested in a female student!"

<b>

"Hmm, it seems you have something rare hidden in your bosom."

"This magical wave... it's quite a high purity Rawb Crystal, isn't it?"

"Oh, if you don't mind, could you show it to me?"

<b>

The professors seem interested in what Lady Cordelia has.

When asked if she had something, Lady Cordelia took out a brooch from the pocket of her chest to show.

Is it silver? On a silver base woven into a heart shape with vines, there is a golden stone about three centimeters in size.

<b>

"I received it from my father. I can't wear it on my uniform, so I keep it in my bosom like this."

<b>

When the professors requested to see it a little closer, Lady Cordelia shyly offered the brooch.

Professors, please don't break it? This is something precious to Lady Cordelia. If you do something strange, I will get angry!

<b>

"I understand. ...Oh, this is quite rare."

"Without a doubt, it's that, from Teril's..."

"Hmm, the probability is about one in five... perhaps."

<b>

The professors each took the brooch and began discussing it, wondering if they understood what it was.

<b>

"I'm sorry about that."

"It seems we've had the chance to see something rare. Take good care of it."

"Hmm, the person who sent it seems to care for you very much. Be sure not to worry that person."

<b>

"…Ah, yes. Thank you…"

<b>

Having satisfied themselves, the professors gently returned the brooch to Lady Cordelia.

Hmm, it seems they treated it more carefully than I expected. Could it be that it was a surprisingly valuable item?

Lady Cordelia, too, seemed surprised by how the professors handled the brooch, as she widened her eyes slightly when receiving it.

Afterward, she held the returned brooch close to her chest, likely thinking of the person who gave it to her, influenced by the professors' words.

<b>

"Hmm! It seems you also wear something rare!"

"What?! Huh?!"

<b>

Professor Seiwashi suddenly turned to Karen and thrust his face forward!

Of course, Karen was surprised. She responded with a strange voice without thinking.

<b>

"Oh! This has a rare aura as well!"

"Hmm?! This seems... slightly, but there is holy energy contained within!"

"Hmm? You are also wearing something else. This is very faint... faint but—"

"Ahhh! Professors! This is bad! We're out of time!"

<b>

Whoa! That startled me!

Professor Joseline slammed her teacup onto the table and suddenly shouted while staring at the wall clock placed nearby.

Everyone turned their surprised gazes toward the assistant professor.

<b>

"This is bad! The report meeting is approaching!"

"Hmm, I think we still have time."

"What are you talking about?! The report meeting starts at 5 PM! It's already just before 4 PM! Hurry up, please! Lord Goldberg is waiting!"

"I think we can start preparing soon and still make it."

"You always say that, and yet you end up being late! I'm the one who always gets scolded by Mr. Sheldon when we're late!"

"That's because you always end up being the last one, flustered, scattering documents and materials, right? It's your own fault!"

"Ah! That doesn't matter! Hurry up and get ready! Ah! Everyone, please help me gather the scattered reports!"

<b>

Whoa, things suddenly got hectic!

It feels like only Professor Joseline is the one in a flurry...

Well, being scolded by Mrs. Sheldon is indeed scary.

<b>

With that, we hurriedly gathered the documents that seemed to be reports scattered across the table and floor and handed them to the professors, only to be promptly thrown out of the room by Professor Joseline.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work today! Let's meet again tomorrow on campus!"

<b>

The door was slammed shut like a storm, leaving us in a daze.

Norman, on the other side of the door, was bowing his head apologetically, which oddly stuck in my mind.

<b>

"Now then, professors! Are we ready to depart?! ...Aghyopegyo!"

"J-Joseline?! Why are you headfirst into a specimen?! No! You have to get out quickly or you'll suffocate?!"

"Nooo! The rare magical beast specimen! What are you doing, assistant?!"

"What are you doing to the precious mineral specimen?! Hmm?! The reports are soaked in the specimen's solution!"

"Hmm, it seems we're back to the same pattern as always."

<b>

A loud crash echoed from the other side of the door.

Immediately after, the panicked voice of Norman and the professors' scolding could be heard from inside.

<b>

...Is Professor Joseline going to be okay...?
