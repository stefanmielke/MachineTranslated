# 65 Cameron Fourier's Upset.

That evening, Cameron Fourier took to the floor in a good mood.

Finally, I was able to have dinner alone with the girl I was looking for.

<blank>

Up until now, I have not been able to have serious conversations because of the large group dinners and the extra hump that comes with being a mother.

But that finally came true on this day, and I am pleased with the conversation.

<blank>

He nodded his head in admiration, both at his own background and at the state of King's Landing.

It is only natural that a girl of her age would show interest if I told her a little about King's Landing.

By now, they must be excitedly dreaming about the gorgeous royal city.

After all, she is just a country girl. If I talk to her about King's Landing two or three more times, her mind will be occupied with King's Landing. Then it will be ours.

<blank>

That girl is a top-notch woman that you don't see even in King's Landing.

They are still young, but it is time for them to learn to socialize with adults.

At least, Fourier decided, they had grown enough for him to teach them.

<blank>

Her slender shoulders and fresh arms extend from them. Her white fingertips, which move in a fluid motion, cannot help but catch the eye as they move.

The slightly smaller head rests on a slender, supple neck and is wonderfully balanced.

The line from the top of the well-shaped oval head to the small, gently flowing, pointed chin.

And in the center of it, a small but well-shaped pointed nose looks toward the front.

The two eyes across the nose were large and filled with a cobalt green glow.

Once you look into her eyes, you can't take your eyes off of her. It is as if they are filled with enchantment.

And her hair is red and translucent, catching the light and emitting a clear glow. It is like the radiance of rubies.

Furthermore, the twin dunes of her bosom are already large enough to satisfy a man's needs.

And that thin waist.

The rounded curves that continued from there were lush and promising of the maturity that would soon come.

<blank>

What an exquisite product!

I am so lucky. I never thought I would be able to pick up so many things in such a rural area!

I can't imagine how much fun it would be to take her to King's Landing and surround her. ...... I can't help but laugh just thinking about it.

<blank>

Now there is no bothering father.

He and his mother must be feeling rather lonely in the absence of the family patriarch.

If you give them kind words, understanding, and dreams for the future, it is easy to gain their trust.

Now is the perfect time to round them up.

We have done this many times before, so there is no mistake.

Nothing is easier to fall for than a girl of that age.

<blank>

Cameron Houllier continued to laugh his insipid laugh, thinking of the pleasures he was sure would soon come his way.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The next day, when the sun had not yet dawned, Cameron Houllier's pleasant dreamtime was brought to an end by a raucous clamor.

<blank>

Fourier grimly got out of bed, put on a gown, and opened the door with force to slam the protest to the source of all this noise.

<blank>

Ah! Mr. Fourier! Thank goodness! I was just about to call for you!

What's going on, Magog? What's all this noise?

<blank>

It was one of the followers Fourier had brought with him from King's Landing.

Fourier had brought several squires and a personal escort with him on this trip to take care of his personal needs.

The guards are necessary when the houriers go to places that are out of bounds in the eyes of the Order, and they are the ones who will do most of the work as long as they are given money and goods.

<blank>

The travel expenses of these men are also covered by the delegation's expenses, but Fourier considers them a necessary expense and does not believe that they are using public funds for private purposes.

That's why they only consider it their job when civil servants take time out of their sleep to account for their expenses.

<blank>

Now one of the followers he had brought with him, a small, mature man called Magok, peeled his downcast eyes and turned to Fourier, who spoke in a flustered manner.

<blank>

'Word has reached us from the forest campsite! The Knights have asked me to summon Master Fourier at once!"

Is it the messenger? Surely, according to the schedule, the supply base should be ready and the messenger should be back by now.... But even so, isn't it too noisy? What's all this commotion while it's still dark? What's all the fuss over a messenger? Hmm? Isn't it so, Magog?

Ha, ha! Yes, sir! Your left, but ......, the customer would like to report to Mr. Fourier once and ask him to confirm the ......"

"A guest for me? Confirmation? Who is it? Who is that rude fellow making a fuss so early in the morning? Are you sure he is of the Order of the Knights?

Ha, hi! There is no doubt about it! I have seen you every day during this trip, so there can be no mistake! I am Luke Trevor, leader of the 7th Mobile Heavy Knights!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Luke Trevor was hurrying back to Amcam with his own team in the early morning before dawn, immediately after receiving a report from Casey Guinness.

The purpose is to report the emergency situation to Cameron Fourier, the head of the survey team who is currently at Amkam House, and to ask for instructions afterwards.

<blank>

Before arriving at the Amkam House, he had issued instructions to the Protectorate at the I blockade and to the Knights, who were waiting in temporary quarters in the village with their men in tow, to prepare themselves for an emergency situation.

He was to go immediately to Irosio's friends as reinforcements.

<blank>

Casey called them "defensive preparations" not reinforcements, but he wasn't kidding. No mobile heavy knight would abandon his comrades!

What Casey brought with him, shown on the video equipment, is indeed a great threat. It is a horrifying situation to be confronted with such a thing.

But! That's why! There is no way we can abandon our friends in such a situation!

<blank>

The defense system was to be left to the Amkham Protectorate, and as soon as we had Fourier's permission, we would set out as reinforcements for Irosio as soon as possible.

<blank>

While Trevor was waiting in the hall of the Amkam House for Fourier's followers to intercede for him, August Dulles, the village chief, who had heard of the situation, and the three Amkam patriarchs, Silence Croquis and Alphonse Beers, as well as the headwoman and her daughters, Sonia and Suzy, had also gathered to learn more about the situation. The head lady and her daughters, Sonia and Susie, had gathered there to learn the details of the situation.

<blank>

Is this really the time for all of you to be here, making a fuss at this hour? Is it just the return of the messenger?"

<blank>

Cameron Fourier looked around at those gathered in the hall, sniffed loudly and tossed them a word in disgust.

<blank>

"...... Apparently, you lack awareness of what's going on."

<blank>

Fourier frowned at Silence's mutterings.

<blank>

A messenger arrived at the camp site 30 minutes before " Contact with enemy forces at a depth of 35,000 at Irosio. Total numbers reported to be in excess of 2,000.

<blank>

Trevor, not being caught in the middle of their exchange, immediately stepped forward and began reporting.

<blank>

To "......, 2,000! Enemy? Not a hexenbiest? But we're talking more than 30 kilometers away, aren't we?"

<blank>

Trevor is upset by the number, but immediately tries to reassure himself that it is much further than this.

<blank>

Please check here first.

<blank>

So saying, Trevor took out a brass-colored cylindrical object and went straight to the table prepared in the center of the hall by the Amcam House butlers.

<blank>

On the table, a transparent half sphere, which looked like it was made of crystal, was installed on the entire tabletop.

Sonia overhears Suzy say that this is an image projection device.

Suzy's eyes widened in surprise at seeing the magical tool for the first time.

<blank>

Trevor inserted the cylindrical object he was holding into the side of the projection device and began to operate the magical tool as it was.

<blank>

To Susie, the cylindrical object looked similar to the "stacked cylinders magic circle" she had seen in the temple.

Sonia told me that this is a "magic storage cabinet" that contains a magic circle that records information and also contains a magic battery.

<blank>

While I was receiving such explanation from Sonia, the crystal hemispheres on the table came into light.

The inside of the crystal, which had been transparent, becomes hazy, as if it were foggy.

Soon, something blurred in the fog begins to move.

The vague contours moving in the fog gradually came into focus and began to take shape as images.

<blank>

I notice that the knights in mobile armor are running.

The trees seem a little sparse for deep in the forest.

A member of the knighthood is facing us, pointing to the rear and shouting something.

He was opening and closing his mouth wide. Perhaps he was telling them to get back.

Immediately it went straight ahead.

<blank>

The images had no sound and no color.

Susie stared at the image, thinking it looked like an old talkie movie.

No, the movement is even rougher than in the past black-and-white images seen on television and other recorded images. It is like a frame-by-frame movie. I think the focus is also very poor.

<blank>

Still, I knew what was going on.

<blank>

Something white emerged from the trees ahead.

The water was flowing out of the house, one after the other.

<blank>

It was a white bone with a weapon in its hand.

A swarm of armed skeletons swept in.

<blank>

Ridiculous! A skeleton warrior?

No." It's not just bones! It's flesh, it's moving fast, and there are undead warriors out there!"

<blank>

Silence and Alphonse raised their voices with their eyes.

On the screen, we see the knights reaping off such hordes of undead one after another.

The recorder must have felt reassured by the dependable appearance of the Knights, and a sense of stability emerged in the images that had been shaking so hurriedly.

<blank>

What's this ......, no need to panic, is there? It doesn't look like we need to send reinforcements, does it?"

<blank>

"...... Now, that was 'Black Rock' you just saw on the screen for a second, wasn't it?"

Yes, the distance you said 35,000 and the ...... match up with the proposed camp site."

The undead have sprung up near "Black Rock"? And in such numbers? That's ridiculous! That's impossible!

<blank>

I said, "...... No, wait! What the hell was that?

<blank>

While Fourier's face contorted at the fearlessness of the undead he was seeing for the first time, he was relieved at the success of the knights and told them that they were being too cautious, but August, Alphonse, and Silence certainly sensed the abnormality of the situation.

<blank>

August and Alphonse judged it to be in the vicinity of "Black Rock" from a small black hill-like object that appeared for a moment behind the screen through a gap in the trees.

Silence voices that there is no way the undead can occur in that place.

<blank>

This is Irosio, not the ruins of an ancient battlefield. Even if undead were to appear, at best there would only be a few at a time.

In order for the undead to arise in large numbers, they need dense magic power and a huge amount of human emotional stagnation.

Irosio is indeed a place with a high concentration of magic, but the flow is fast near this "black rock" and it is not a place where a large magical stagnation can easily occur.

At first glance, the number of undead on the screen appears to exceed three digits.

There is no cause for that much undead to be created here.

<blank>

While Houllier tried to find optimistic hope, the three of them, their brows wrinkled, looked at each other even more in the next moment.

<blank>

Up above, among the branches of the trees in the back of the screen, something appeared from the other side of a coniferous tree more than 20 meters high.

It is a large, white, rounded object.

Eventually a dark, deep eye socket peeked out from the side of the tree, and it was clearly a huge skull.

A skeleton with a skull the size of a human being stood in place and stepped out with giant feet.

<blank>

As it was, it swung its long arms around and began reaping the knights in its place.

<blank>

What is this? What is this? What is this monster?

Great Skull?

A higher species of the undead? That's ridiculous!

Threat value is 70! You don't just show up here!

<blank>

Fourier screamed and backed away from the huge figure.

August and Silence identified it as a higher level undead named "Great Skull".

Against this opponent, Alphonse sees that the strength of the Knights on their own will be tough.

<blank>

The combat value of a member of the Order is roughly 20, which is equivalent to the 5th of the Protectorate.

30 in the group leader class, which is in line with the 6 st.

The safety margin should be at least four people in the troop and two to three in the team leader class.

<blank>

But that makes sense only if a solid one-on-four formation is in place.

In this turbulent situation, we should not expect that balance of power to be maintained at all times.

We should consider that those on the front lines are always under five or six times the normal load.

<blank>

Dulles and the three others sank into heavy thoughts without uttering a word.

<blank>

What? What is it? What is this?

<blank>

And Fourier exclaimed anxiously at the sudden turbulence of the image.

<blank>

The photographer must have discovered something. By moving to the left and to the right on the screen, we can see that the operator of this magical tool is moving to the right and to the left.

Eventually, the image suddenly stopped moving and was yukking backward as if it was slithering backward.

<blank>

However, the image suddenly rattled from backward to forward as if it were stumbling.

<blank>

Then a shadow of something fell on the photographer, and the next moment the viewpoint of the screen rose higher, and the image began to rotate vertically as it was.

The filming equipment, which must have been flying in a spinning circle, was streaming across the screen, moment by moment, showing the sky, the forest trees, the ground, the undead writhing in the forest, and the knights who were reaping them.

Eventually, the apparatus fell to the ground, the screen bounced slightly, and the movement was fixed as it was.

Then, the image was interrupted by something huge and white closing in.

<blank>

"...... what's that last one?"

It's huge... Great Skull ......?"

No! That's not a humanoid thing!"

<blank>

August, Alphonse, and Silence considered the last of the images.

That scale is no mistake, it belongs to the large undead.

However, that white shadow that snatched the screen at the end, which must have struck the photographer, did not seem to be a very human figure.

<blank>

In addition to the Great Skull, other large undead have been identified as the Skull Sentipede and the Old Scale Dinosaur.

""......?!!!""

<blank>

Trevor's report was met with rapt attention by all three.

<blank>

Both of them have a threat value of over 100! The Knights alone cannot take them on unprepared!"

No. But the Imperial Head and Old Man Conrad would! But the Imperial Head and old Conrad would!"

<blank>

Threat value over 100.

Its strength cannot be simply calculated to be equal to that of five persons with a combat value of 20. It is already an existence of another dimension.

The combat value is 50 for the 8th in the upper group, and 90 for the 10th.

The only ones who can compete with them on their own are those who have a combat value of over 100. In other words, only those above grade A, known as "graded" or "graded holders," can compete with them.

<blank>

Grade A has a combat value of 110.

Howard and Conrad, who have already retired from the front lines, are tentatively assigned Grade A status.

However, they were both in the Exceeds class beyond "AAA" during their working years.

At one time its combat value was over 200.

<blank>

They are now wearing equipment that has been adjusted by Marsh Cauzbert, and they say they have regained their active strength.

With these two together, there is nothing to fear even if a threat value of over 100 comes in.

<blank>

But see .............

<blank>

He says he's seen multiple large undead. At least five or more of each were seen by Casey at ......."

""......!!!""

<blank>

The three peeled their eyes for the third time and were speechless.

<blank>

Sonia's hand is cupped and discolored white.

Suzy saw this and placed her own hand on Sonia's hand.

<blank>

There are several with a threat value over 100. And they say there may be more than 10 of them.

In a one-on-one battle, there is no way those two would fall behind.

However, it is a different story when it comes to facing 10 or more of them. The level of difficulty is completely different.

And even though they are small fry, they have to deal with an army of undead at the same time.

Even if they were to form a joint front with the Knights, the difference in quantity is too overwhelming.

<blank>

We were further informed that they were taking a coordinated move. In other words, ......."

"Who's in command? An army of the undead?

Yes, I have confirmed up to 2,000 of them, but probably the real number is several times more.... Casey said he heard a voice saying that 60% of the earth is filled with white ......, and it is marching in! With ......."

Oh my god ......!!!"

<blank>

August couldn't help but blurt it out.

It's a vast horde of undead, including several large forms that are just plain nasty.

Moreover, they say that it is not just a herd, but may be an army that is marching with a will.

Where in the world have all these troops been hiding?

<blank>

August, this is what caused the 'overflow.'

"...... Oh, first of all, no doubt. It is now about to overflow from the forest out ......"

<blank>

August and Alphonse reasoned that this legion of undead was the cause of the "overflow" on the villages.

The undead swelled up and went, the demonic beasts were pushed out, and an 'overflow' was occurring. ......

<blank>

And now, from the depths of the forest, this army is on the move.

<blank>

"Shit! I'm leaving! August! I've got to get my men up here now!

Wait, Silence!

'Time is of the essence! We'll talk later!!!!"

<blank>

Wait a minute! What the hell? What the hell is going on?

<blank>

Cameron Fourier asks Silence, who is beginning to move in a hurry and makes no attempt to hide his concern.

<blank>

Don't you get it? It has already been more than 15 hours since the Knights made contact with them! They are fast and need no rest! They can't be any slower than the messenger! The messenger came back this morning! And they still haven't made it here! Do you understand? That means someone is holding them off!

<blank>

Silence told Fourier in an exasperated tone.

It is not surprising that the hordes of undead have already avalanched into this village, as they should have.

But deep in the forest, the survey team is still damming it up.

<blank>

Fourier's face visibly lost blood as he realized that the Immortal Legion could appear here at any moment.

<blank>

Wait a minute! So you mean to tell me that at any moment these monsters could come crashing down on us?

'I told you so! Hurry up, Alphonse! I'm on my way with all my strength!

"Fourier," he said! Permission for us to go out as well! We cannot abandon our comrades like this!"

<blank>

As if there is not a moment to lose, Silence announces reinforcements to the forest.

Trevor, too, was not to be delayed, and he asked Fourier for permission to go out.

<blank>

Ba, silly! A sortie? What are you talking about? I can't allow you to ...... do that! It's defense! Defend... defend yourselves! You too! I will not allow the Amkham Protectorate to go out! All existing forces will do everything in their power to protect you. ！！！！"

<blank>

Shit! You've got to be kidding me! I didn't hear you talking like this!

<blank>

Houllier was swearing deep in his gut.

<blank>

I had been told that this trip was the safest one, and I had convinced myself of that.

But I had never heard of the possibility of such monsters advancing on us!

Neither His Highness nor His Eminence the Chief Grand High Priest has said a word! If I had heard them, I would not have come to this place!

I took this job because your eminence insisted! It's not worth it if I don't get a special reward when I get back!

<blank>

Damn it! And what are you going to do in case you move your army and thin out your defenses and such an army breaks through here?

If it overflows into the country as it is and causes damage, who will be responsible?

If that were to happen, it would damage my career! I'm not kidding!

I don't care what happens to these villages, but that must be avoided at all costs!

Whatever the cost, we must do everything we can to stop them here!

<blank>

But, but Representative Houllier!

Don't be silly! You won't allow it? Where is the need for us to follow your orders?

<blank>

At Houllier's words, Trevor and Silence stopped moving, their eyes wide open.

Silence then raised his voice, saying that the survey mission had no authority to give orders to AMCAM, even though it was a national organization.

Everyone present stared at Fourier with astonished eyes as he told them that he would not allow them to send out their troops.

<blank>

Frightened by the silences and people's eyes, Fourier continues further.

<blank>

'Woe, I am the nominal representative of the Aurora Council of State and the Royal Office! My word is the will of the state! If you stand in direct opposition to it, know that you are in rebellion against the state!

You want us to abandon those on the front lines? Can't you see that even at this very moment, the Imperial Head and old Conrad are standing as a wall to protect us!

I don't give a shit about you, old man! But more importantly! Who is going to take the responsibility of unleashing such monsters in this country? Defense! Defend to the death!

<blank>

He says that his decisions are synonymous with the country's decisions in the here and now, and he forces the Fourier to build a strong line of defense.

And he even went so far as to suggest that Howard and Conrad be abandoned.

At that moment, the air in the place freezes.

At the same time, Silence grabbed Fourier by the chest and raged.

<blank>

You!

Hiii! Then! Amkam... a, I judge that you have the will to rebel against the Kingdom of the Republic of Aurora until ......!

"......! You!!!!"

<blank>

With his face pale as Silence grabs him by the chest, Fourier still insists that his rebellion against him is treason against the state.

Although thinking that there is no way such a forceful talk will go through, Silence is immensely impressed by Fourier's strong-mindedness.

Slipping out of Silence's hands, which relaxed involuntarily, Fourier held his rising breath and fixed his collar while staring at his hands, avoiding eye contact with Silence.

Then Trevor began to plead for the departure of the troops.

<blank>

Representative! Please! Please... please bring us back to our friends on the front line! Please take us!

No, no, no! I will not allow even a single soldier to go into battle! I tell you to establish a line of defense with all our forces!"

I'm asking you to bend over there! Please!!!!"

I won't allow it! I'll never forgive you! If you insist, you can go to ...... alone! You alone!

"............ck!"

<blank>

This time, glaring at Trevor, Fourier cut off his plea.

Houllier is definitely a decision maker when it comes to the Knights.

If he doesn't allow the Knights to go out, he can't send out the troops.

Trevor bites back at Fourier, but is speechless when he is dismissed off the top of his head.

<blank>

Behind Trevor, who gritted his teeth and clenched his fists in pain, August stepped forward with his right hand raised lightly as if to say, "Wait.

<blank>

Then, would you mind if we send one of our teams to ......?"

What the hell?

"It's one team, just a few of us. ......

Mu......, but ......"

"The total number of villagers remaining in the village of Amkham today is 2,352. The people of Amkham, even the old and the children, are more capable of fighting than the guards in the area, you know?"

"......n, mu......"

Only one team of women will be sent out to face them. Either way, we need reconnaissance, don't we? We need a way to know when and where they are coming from. Am I wrong?"

<blank>

Augusto asked me to send one team out to do a reconnaissance.

But Augusto is not talking while looking at Fourier.

At the end of his gaze, Suzy is there.

<blank>

Suzy and August exchanged glances and nodded.

<blank>

Houlihan ponders, oblivious to August's gaze.

<blank>

Reconnaissance is certainly necessary. We can at least get out of the uncertainty of not knowing when they will come.

Besides, I say it's just one team of women. At least there is no less of a loss of strength than ripping up the Knights' personnel.

And he is from Amkam, which knows the forest. No doubt they are better suited for scouting than those of the Knights.

Besides, we want a strength of over 2,000 people.

I wonder how long it would take to get that many guards in place if we were to release contacts to nearby cities now. ......

Conditions are not bad.

We have nothing to lose.

A strike force will be organized from the rear, and we can hold it until it gets there.

Nope! It is important that you hold it until I evacuate to a safe zone! I don't care what happens after that.

Perhaps this village is finished.

Trampled by the attacking undead, and eventually overrun by magical beasts, it will disappear from the map of this country.

<blank>

"......Mu, ......Mu, that's just one team! Every other villager, women and children alike, every last one of them, must be put on the defense! Understood?

<blank>

Fourier thought about it as quickly as he could and slammed the words down on August as if to spit them out.

<blank>

"Ma, Magok, hurry up! Hurry up and get ready to leave!"

?" ...... is Yes! Just now! Hurry up, now!

<blank>

Evacuating while you can is definitely the right choice.

It would be better to secure ...... what can be protected as much as possible from this village that will be destroyed from now on.

<blank>

After further contemplating this, Fourier, after flying an order to his followers, reached out his hand toward Suzy.

<blank>

Come on! Princess, here I come!"

"Yes? It's me, huh?"

Of course! I would like to ask you to come here with me, Cameron Fourier! I beg you to come with me and Cameron Fourier."

Where is Master Fourier going at this critical moment?

Of course we have to evacuate! We must leave this village as soon as possible.

I see. ......, I can't go. Please take care and evacuate, Mr. Fourier.

I'll tell you what..."...... Come on, come here!

<blank>

Normally, there would be no way to be at peace when a village is in such a critical situation.

And a young girl of no more than a few years old would not be intimidated.

With this in mind, Fourier invited Susie to go with him.

<blank>

Suzy, however, is not so sure, and she turns away from Fourier's invitation with an awakened expression on her face.

<blank>

Irritated, Fourier grabbed Susie's slender arm and reached out to take her by force.

<blank>

But no matter how much she tried to reach out, Fourier's hand never reached Suzy's arm.

Sulisuluri and for some reason, it grabs the sky and can't catch Suzy.

<blank>

Mmm-hmm? This? Mm?"

<blank>

Fourier could not understand that.

Is something happening to me? I stare at my hand that I pulled back, wondering if I am being shown some kind of hallucination.

<blank>

"Please, run along to ......, Mr. Fourier?"

Crap!"

<blank>

Suzy said coldly with awakened eyes.

Fourier was frightened by the look in Suzy's eyes and choked on his words.

His deep cobalt green eyes stirred an unfathomable sense of unease, and I backed away.

<blank>

But Fourier was frustrated by the fact that his body had unconsciously lowered itself and his mind felt frightened.

What is a man like myself doing being so frightened of such a small girl?

<blank>

You'll regret this! You'll regret this! Shit! Magok! Let's go!

<blank>

Houlihan spat out an exasperated, discarded line, turned himself around, and left with his followers in tow.

<blank>

Trevor immediately took his leave!　and bowed to the Amkham men and returned to the temporary quarters of the Knights.

<blank>

He said he intended to head out into the woods, even if alone.

They are going back to their lodgings to tell the group leaders what happened and leave the rest of the work to them.

He then wants to meet up with Amcam's team going into the forest.

August gladly accepted and sent him on his way.

<blank>

After sending Trevor off, August turns to Suzy and says a few words.

<blank>

"...... Suzy."

<blank>

Susie made eye contact with August and nodded, then asked AnnaMarie, who was standing next to her, with a small tilt of her head.

<blank>

AnnaMarie, can you go get my gear right away?

Rest assured, young lady, your belongings are already at the Amcome House.

<blank>

Suddenly, AnnaMarie bowed her head at Suzy's side and answered without starch.

<blank>

In 15 minutes, your daughter will be ready and ready for you to see.

Thank you, AnnaMarie. Mr. August, I'll be at the One's office in half an hour."

<blank>

At Suzy's words, August stepped forward.

<blank>

"Mr. Suzy, ......, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, ...... your head."

<blank>

Alphonse and Silence, too, please, Suzy. Please, miss," followed August.

Suzy smiled at the three of them and said yes.

<blank>

As it is, Suzy faces Sonia.

<blank>

"Suzy ......, get that man, ...... Howard, please."

<blank>

Sonia takes Susie's hand and spins words as if she is praying.

<blank>

It's okay, Sonia. I'm going to bring your father home, who is so busy with his work that he makes your mother lonely. Don't worry, okay?"

<blank>

Suzy tilted her head and smiled as she said this.
