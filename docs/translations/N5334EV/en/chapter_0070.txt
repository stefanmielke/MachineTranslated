# Chapter 65: Cameron Fourier's Disturbance

That night, Cameron Fourier went to bed in high spirits.

He had finally been able to have a dinner alone with the girl he had been aiming for.

<b>

Until now, the dinners had always been with a large group, or with the unnecessary burden of her mother tagging along, making it impossible to have a proper conversation.

However, that had finally come true on this day, and he was satisfied with the content of their conversation.

<b>

He had nodded in admiration throughout, impressed by his own background and the state of the royal capital.

It was only natural that a girl of that age would show interest if he talked a little about the royal capital.

By now, she must be dreaming of the glamorous royal capital and feeling excited, right?

After all, she was just a country girl. If he talked about the royal capital two or three more times, her head would be filled with thoughts of it. Then she would be his for sure.

<b>

That girl was a rare beauty, even in the royal capital.

Though she still had some childishness, she was at an age where she could start to learn about adult interactions.

At the very least, Fourier judged that she had grown enough for him to guide her.

<b>

Her slender shoulders and the fresh, supple upper arms extending from them. The flowing white fingertips moved in a way that was hard to ignore.

On her slender, graceful neck rested a slightly smaller head, creating a wonderful balance.

From the top of her well-shaped oval head, the line gently flowed down to a small, pointed chin.

And at the center, a small but well-shaped pointed nose was gazing straight ahead.

The two large eyes, separated by her nostrils, glimmered with a cobalt green light.

Those eyes, on the verge of spilling over, would captivate anyone who looked into them just once, as if enchanted by a spell.

And her hair was a translucent red, reflecting light and emitting a clear glow. It was like the brilliance of a ruby.

Furthermore, the twin hills of her chest were already of sufficient size to satisfy a man's desires.

And that slender waist.

The rounded curves continuing from there were fresh and promised the maturity to come.

<b>

What an exquisite item she was!

How lucky he felt. To come to such a rural area and find such a treasure!

If he were to take that girl to the royal capital and keep her to himself, how much enjoyment could he experience… Just imagining it made him want to laugh.

<b>

Now, there was no noisy father around.

Rather, her mother and she must be feeling lonely due to the absence of the head of the household.

If he offered her kind words, understanding, and dreams for the future, gaining her trust would be easy.

Now was the perfect opportunity to wrap her around his finger.

He had done this many times before, so there was no doubt about it.

There was nothing easier to ensnare than a girl of that age.

<b>

Cameron Fourier continued to indulge in thoughts of the pleasures he was sure would come, laughing lewdly without getting bored.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The next day, before the sun had risen, Cameron Fourier was jolted awake by a loud commotion that shattered his pleasant dreams.

<b>

Fourier got out of bed in a bad mood, put on his gown, and forcefully opened the door to protest against the source of the noise.

<b>

"Ah! Lord Fourier!! Thank goodness! I was just coming to call for you!!"

"What is it, Magock?! What is all this noise?!"

<b>

It was one of the attendants he had brought from the royal capital.

For this trip, Fourier had brought several attendants to take care of his personal needs, as well as personal guards separate from the knight order.

The guards were necessary when Fourier went to places where the knight order's eyes would be a hindrance, and they would do most things as long as they were compensated.

<b>

The travel expenses for these individuals were also covered by the delegation's budget, but Fourier did not think for a moment that he was using public funds for personal use.

Even if the bureaucrats were kept awake calculating expenses, he only thought that it was their job.

<b>

Now, one of the attendants he had brought, a small middle-aged man named Magock, looked at Fourier with wide, sunken eyes and spoke hurriedly.

<b>

"I have received word from the camp in the forest! The knight order has urgently requested your presence, Lord Fourier!!"

"A messenger? Certainly, according to the schedule, the supply base should be ready, and the messenger should be returning soon… But isn't this too noisy?! What is this commotion so early in the morning?! Is it necessary to make such a fuss just because a messenger has arrived? Huh? Isn't that right, Magock?!"

"Y-Yes! That is correct! However… the guest has requested that you be informed and confirmed first…"

"A guest? Confirmation? Who is this rude person making a fuss so early in the morning? It must be someone from the knight order, right?"

"Y-Yes! There is no mistake! I have seen him every day during this journey, so I can assure you! It is Luke Trevor, the leader of the 7th class of the mobile heavy knight order!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Luke Trevor had hurried back to Amukamu with his class immediately after receiving a report from Casey Guinness early in the morning, before the sun had risen.

He was there to report an emergency situation to Cameron Fourier, the representative of the investigation team currently at Amukamu House, and to seek further instructions.

<b>

Before arriving at Amukamu House, he had instructed the civil defense group at the first post and sent his subordinates to the temporary lodgings in the village to prepare for the emergency situation.

They were to head to the allied forces of Iroshio as reinforcements at once.

<b>

Casey had called it "defense preparation," but that was nonsense. There was no way a mobile heavy knight would abandon his comrades!

The images brought by Casey were indeed a significant threat. Facing such things was a situation that should instill terror.

But! Precisely because of that! There was no way he could abandon comrades who were in such a situation!!

<b>

The defense system was entrusted to the Amukamu civil defense group, and as soon as they secured Fourier's permission, they would set out for Iroshio as reinforcements as quickly as possible.

<b>

While Trevor waited in the hall of Amukamu House, asking Fourier's attendants to relay his message, the village chief, August Dales, and the heads of the three families of Amukamu—Silence Croki, Alphonse Beas—along with the chief's wife and daughter, Sonia and Suzy, gathered to learn the details of the situation.

<b>

"Is it really necessary for all of you to gather and make such a fuss at this hour? It's only a messenger returning, after all?"

<b>

Cameron Fourier looked around at those gathered in the hall and, with a snort, spoke to them in disbelief.

<b>

"…It seems that there is a lack of awareness regarding the current situation."

<b>

At Silence's murmur, Fourier frowned.

<b>

"Thirty minutes ago, a messenger arrived at the camp. They reported contact with enemy forces at a depth of 35,000 in Iroshio. The total number exceeds 2,000."

<b>

Ignoring the exchange between the two, Trevor stepped forward and began his report.

<b>

"W-What?! 2,000?! Enemies? Not monsters? B-But that should be over 30 kilometers away, right?"

<b>

Trevor was shaken by the number but quickly tried to reassure himself that it was far ahead.

<b>

"First, please confirm this."

<b>

Saying this, Trevor took out a brass-colored cylindrical object and headed towards the table that the butlers of Amukamu House had prepared in the center of the hall.

<b>

On that table was a transparent hemisphere that looked like it had been crafted from crystal, taking up the entire surface.

Sonia whispered to Suzy that this was a projection device.

Suzy, surprised by the magical tool she was seeing for the first time, widened her eyes.

<b>

Trevor inserted the cylindrical object into the projection device and began to operate the magical tool.

<b>

To Suzy, that cylindrical object resembled the "layered cylindrical magic circle" she had seen in the temple.

When she asked Sonia, she was told that this was indeed a magical storage device containing a magic circle for recording information, with a built-in magical battery.

<b>

While receiving such an explanation from Sonia, the crystal hemisphere on the table began to glow.

The transparent interior of the crystal became misty.

Eventually, something blurred began to move within the mist.

The vague outline moving in the mist gradually began to come into focus, taking shape as an image.

<b>

It was clear that members of the knight order wearing mobile armor were running.

The trees seemed a bit sparse for being deep in the forest.

A knight was pointing backward and shouting something as he approached.

He was likely saying "Get down."

He soon moved forward and disappeared from view.

<b>

The image had neither sound nor color.

Suzy thought it looked like an old talkie film as she stared at the image.

No, it was even more jerky than the old black-and-white footage she had seen on television. The focus was quite soft as well.

<b>

Even so, she understood what was happening.

<b>

From between the trees ahead, something white emerged.

It seemed to overflow out one after another.

<b>

It was a horde of skeletal warriors armed with weapons.

<b>

"Impossible! Skeleton warriors?!"

"No! It's not just bones! There are flesh-covered ones too, and undead warriors that move quickly!"

<b>

Silence and Alphonse exclaimed in astonishment.

The screen showed the knights of the order cutting down the horde of undead one after another.

The recorder likely felt a sense of reassurance at the knights' reliable figures, as the previously shaky image began to stabilize.

<b>

"W-What… if this is the case, isn't there no particular need to panic? It seems we don't need to send reinforcements?"

<b>

"…What I just saw for a moment was 'Black Rock,' wasn't it?"

"Yes, it matches the distance of 35,000 and the planned camp location."

"Undead appeared near 'Black Rock'? And in such numbers? Impossible! That can't be true!!"

<b>

"…Wait! What is that?!"

<b>

Fourier grimaced at the horrifying sight of the undead he was seeing for the first time but felt relieved by the knights' performance, suggesting that perhaps they were being overly cautious. However, August, Alphonse, and Silence were keenly aware of the abnormality of the situation.

<b>

August and Alphonse judged that the small black hill that had briefly appeared in the background of the screen was near 'Black Rock.'

Silence raised his voice, stating that there was no way undead could appear in that location.

<b>

Unless it was the site of an ancient battlefield, this was Iroshio. Even if undead were to appear, it would be at most a few at a time.

For a large number of undead to arise, a dense magical energy and a significant accumulation of human emotions would be necessary.

Iroshio was indeed a place rich in magical energy, but the flow was swift near 'Black Rock,' and it was not a place where a significant magical accumulation could easily form.

The undead appearing on the screen seemed to exceed three digits at a glance.

There were no factors present here that could give rise to that many undead.

<b>

While Fourier sought to find an optimistic hope, the three, with deepening furrows on their brows, were further astonished the next moment.

<b>

From above, between the branches of the trees in the back of the screen, something large and white emerged from beyond the coniferous trees, exceeding 20 meters in height.

Eventually, it revealed its dark, deep eye sockets from behind the trees; it was clearly a gigantic skull.

A skeleton with a skull the size of a person stood there and took a giant step forward.

<b>

It began to swing its long arms, sweeping away the knights in the area.

<b>

"W-What is this?!! What kind of monster is this?!!"

"Great Skull?!"

"Is it an upper-tier undead?! Impossible!!"

"Its threat level is 70! This is not something that should appear here!!"

<b>

Fourier screamed and took a step back at the sight of the gigantic figure.

August and Silence identified it as an upper-tier undead known as 'Great Skull.'

Alphonse believed that, against such an opponent, the combat power of a single knight would be insufficient.

<b>

The combat value of the knights was roughly 20, equivalent to the 5th of the civil defense group.

For class leaders, it was 30, comparable to the 6th.

A safety margin of at least four knights was needed for a single knight, and even class leaders would require two to three.

<b>

However, that only made sense if a solid formation was maintained in a one-on-four scenario.

In the chaos of battle, it would be unrealistic to expect that power balance to be consistently maintained.

One should consider that those on the front lines were under five to six times the normal load.

<b>

Dales and the other three sank into heavy thoughts without uttering a word.

<b>

"W-What?! What is happening here?!!"

<b>

Suddenly, Fourier anxiously shouted as the image became distorted.

<b>

The recorder must have discovered something. The screen moved right and left, indicating that the operator of this magical tool was in a panic.

Eventually, it suddenly stopped moving and appeared to be slowly backing away.

<b>

But then, it abruptly lurched forward, and the image jolted.

<b>

Then, a shadow fell over the recorder, and the next moment, the viewpoint of the screen rose high, and the image began to rotate vertically.

The recording device was likely spinning as it flew, capturing the sky, the trees of the forest, the ground, and the undead writhing within it, along with the knights sweeping them away, each appearing for just a moment.

Eventually, the device must have fallen to the ground, as the screen bounced slightly, and the movement became fixed.

Then, a massive white something loomed, and the image cut off.

<b>

"…What was that last one?"

"A large object… Was it a Great Skull?"

"No! That is not a humanoid figure!"

<b>

August, Alphonse, and Silence were pondering the last image.

That scale was undoubtedly that of a large undead.

However, the white shadow that had brushed past the screen, which must have attacked the recorder, did not seem to take on a human form at all.

<b>

"It seems that large undead other than the 'Great Skull' include 'Skull Centipede' and 'Old Scale Dinosaur.'"

"「「「…What?!!」」」"

<b>

The three were left speechless by Trevor's report.

<b>

"Both of them have threat levels over 100!! They are not opponents that can be faced without preparation by the knight order!"

"No! But if it's the head of the order and old Conrad…"

<b>

Threat level over 100.

That combat power does not simply equate to five individuals with a combat value of 20. It exists in a different dimension altogether.

The upper-tier 8th has a combat value of 50. Even the 10th has 90.

Only those with a combat value exceeding 100, known as "Grade Holders," can match them.

<b>

The combat value of a Grade A is 110.

The two who have already retired from the front lines, Howard and Conrad, are currently considered Grade A temporarily.

However, during their active years, they were Exceed classes that surpassed 'AAA.'

Their combat values once exceeded 200.

<b>

The two are now wearing equipment adjusted by Marsh Cowzbart, regaining their former strength.

If these two were together, they would not need to fear even if faced with threats over 100.

<b>

But…….

<b>

"It seems that multiple large undead have been confirmed. At least five of each have been seen, according to Casey…"

"「「「…!!」」」"

<b>

The three widened their eyes and lost their words for the third time.

<b>

The grip in Sonia's hand tightened, turning white.

Seeing this, Suzy gently placed her hand on Sonia's hand.

<b>

Multiple threats over 100. Moreover, there could be more than 10 of them.

In one-on-one combat, there was no way those two would fall behind.

However, if it came to facing more than 10, the situation would be entirely different. The difficulty would be on a completely different level.

Furthermore, even if they were weak, they would have to deal with the horde of undead at the same time.

Even if they formed a joint front with the knight order, the disparity in numbers would be overwhelming.

<b>

"Furthermore, we have received reports that they were moving in a coordinated manner. In other words…"

"Is there someone commanding them?! An undead army?!!"

"Yes, it has been confirmed that there are up to 2,000 of them, but the actual number is likely several times that… Casey heard that six-tenths of the land is covered in white… and that they are advancing!…"

"What the hell…!!"

<b>

August exclaimed involuntarily.

It was a massive horde of undead, including troublesome large ones.

Moreover, it might not just be a horde but an army advancing with intent.

Where on earth had such a force been hiding until now?

<b>

"August, this must be the cause of the 'overflow.'"

"…Yes, there is no doubt about it. They are about to overflow from the forest into the outside…"

<b>

August and Alphonse theorized that this undead army was the cause of the "overflow" affecting the villages.

As the undead swelled, the magical beasts were being pushed out, causing the "overflow" to occur.

<b>

And now, this army was moving out from the depths of the forest.

<b>

"Damn it! I'm going out! August!! Hurry and gather the personnel!"

"Wait, Silence!"

"Time is of the essence! We'll talk later!!"

<b>

"W-Wait! What is happening here?!!"

<b>

Cameron Fourier, unable to hide his anxiety, questioned Silence, who had begun to move hurriedly.

<b>

"Don't you understand?! It has already been over 15 hours since the knight order made contact with them! They move quickly and do not need to rest! It is impossible for them to be slower than the messenger! The messenger returned this morning! Yet they have still not arrived here! Do you understand?! Someone is holding them back!"

<b>

Silence snapped at Fourier in frustration.

The undead horde should have already been crashing into this village by now.

Yet the investigation team was still holding them back deep in the forest.

<b>

Fourier's face visibly lost color as he understood that the undead army could appear at any moment.

<b>

"W-Wait! Are you saying that these monsters could come crashing in here at any moment?!"

"That's exactly what I'm saying! We need to hurry, Alphonse! We are going with all available combat power!!"

"Representative Fourier! We cannot abandon our comrades! Please grant us permission to deploy!"

<b>

Silence declared the need for reinforcements to the forest as if there was no time to waste.

Trevor also pressed for permission to deploy, approaching Fourier.

<b>

"N-No! Deploy? What are you saying? Such a thing… I-I cannot permit it!! Defense! Fortify the defenses…!! You all too! I will not allow the Amukamu civil defense group to deploy! All available forces must be dedicated to defense!!!!"

<b>

Damn it!! This is no joke!

<b>

Fourier cursed inwardly.

<b>

He had been told that this journey was the safest option, and he had accepted that.

However, he had never heard that such monsters could be advancing!

Neither the prince nor the head priest had said a word! If they had, he would never have come this far!!

He had taken on this job because the head priest insisted! When he returned, he expected a special reward; otherwise, it wouldn't be worth it!

<b>

Damn it!! And what if, by moving the troops and thinning the defenses, such an army breaks through here?!

They would overflow into the country, and if any damage occurred, who would take responsibility for that?!

If that happened, it would tarnish my reputation! This is no joke!!

He didn't care what happened to this village, but that was something he absolutely had to avoid!

No matter what sacrifices it took, he had to stop them here!

<b>

"B-But, Representative Fourier!!"

"Don't be ridiculous!! Why should we have to obey your orders?!!"

<b>

At Fourier's words, Trevor and Silence widened their eyes and stopped moving.

Silence raised his voice, stating that even if it was a national agency, the investigation delegation had no authority over Amukamu.

Everyone present looked at Fourier, who refused to allow the troops to be deployed, with astonished expressions.

<b>

Despite being intimidated by Silence and the others, Fourier continued.

<b>

"I am the representative of the Aurora National Council and the Royal Office! My words are the will of the nation! If you oppose me directly, know that it is treason against the state!!"

"Are you telling us to abandon those on the front lines?!! Don't you see that the head of the order and old Conrad are holding the line even now?!"

"I don't care about that old man!! More importantly! Who will take responsibility for unleashing such monsters… into the country?!! Defense! We must establish a defensive line at all costs!!!"

<b>

Fourier insisted that his decision was synonymous with the nation's decision at that moment, forcing the establishment of a defensive line.

Moreover, he even suggested abandoning Howard and Conrad.

At that moment, the air in the room froze.

Simultaneously, Silence grabbed Fourier by the collar, furious.

<b>

"You bastard!!!"

"Y-Yes! Then! I will judge that Amukamu has the intention of rebellion against the Aurora Republic…!!"

"…!! You!!"

<b>

As Silence gripped his collar, Fourier's face turned pale, declaring that any rebellion against him was a rebellion against the state.

Such a forceful argument could not possibly hold, yet Silence was left speechless by Fourier's audacity.

As Silence involuntarily relaxed his grip, Fourier escaped and, while suppressing his breath, straightened his collar, avoiding Silence's gaze.

At that moment, Trevor began to plead for deployment.

<b>

"Representative! Please!! We must go to our comrades on the front lines!! We need to…!!"

"No! No! I will not allow even a single soldier to deploy!! I am telling you to build a defensive line with all available forces!!"

"Please! Just this once! I beg you!!!"

"N-No! I absolutely will not allow it!! If you insist… then… you go alone! Just you alone can go!!!"

"…………Ugh!"

<b>

This time, while glaring at Trevor, Fourier dismissed his plea.

Fourier undoubtedly held the decision-making power over the knight order.

If he did not approve the knight order's deployment, they could not move.

Trevor pressed on, but was rejected outright, leaving him speechless.

<b>

With a pained expression, Trevor clenched his teeth and balled his fists, while August raised his hand lightly as if to say wait, stepping forward.

<b>

"If that's the case, could we send just one team… to scout?"

"What?!"

"Just one team, a mere handful of people…"

"Ugh… But…"

"The total number of villagers remaining in Amukamu is 2,352. Even the elderly and children among the Amukamu people are stronger than the guards around here, right?"

"…Mmm…"

"From that group, we would send only one team of women. We need scouts regardless. We need a means to know when and where they are coming from. Don't we?"

<b>

August proposed to send just one team for scouting.

However, August was not looking at Fourier while speaking.

His gaze was directed at Suzy.

<b>

Exchanging glances with Suzy, August nodded.

<b>

Fourier, unaware of August's gaze, contemplated.

<b>

Indeed, scouting was necessary. They needed to escape the uncertainty of not knowing when the enemy would arrive.

Moreover, he was saying it would be just one team of women. At the very least, that would not reduce their combat power as much as splitting the knight order.

Moreover, the people of Amukamu, who knew the forest well, would undoubtedly be more suited for scouting than the knights.

And they needed over 2,000 combatants.

Even if they sent word to nearby cities now, how long would it take to gather that many guards…?

The conditions were not bad.

In fact, they had nothing to lose.

They just needed to hold out until a hunting party could be organized from the rear and arrive.

No! It was crucial to hold out until he could escape to a safe zone!! He didn't care what happened after that.

This village would likely be finished.

It would be trampled by the advancing undead and eventually ravaged by magical beasts, disappearing from the map of this country.

<b>

"…Fine, just that one team!! All other villagers, regardless of gender, must remain for defense! Understood?!!!"

<b>

Fourier quickly thought of that and spat the words at August.

<b>

"Magock, hurry! Prepare for departure immediately!!"

"Y-Yes! Right away! I'll hurry and get everything ready!!"

<b>

It was undoubtedly the right choice to evacuate now.

It would be best to secure… no, protect as much as possible from this village that was about to be devastated.

<b>

After issuing orders to his attendants, Fourier reached out his hand toward Suzy.

<b>

"Come! Princess, we must go!"

"Me? Is it me?"

"Of course! There is no one else but you, Princess Suzy! I earnestly request that you accompany me, Cameron Fourier."

"Where are you going at such a critical time, Lord Fourier?"

"Of course, to evacuate! We must leave this village as soon as possible."

"I see… I cannot go. Please take care and evacuate, Lord Fourier."

"…Tch! Just come over here!!"

<b>

Under normal circumstances, one would not be able to remain calm in such a critical situation.

Especially not a young girl, who would be expected to be frightened.

Fourier thought this and invited Suzy to come with him.

<b>

However, Suzy coldly rejected Fourier's invitation with a composed expression.

<b>

Irritated, Fourier reached out to grab Suzy's slender arm, trying to forcibly take her with him.

<b>

But no matter how much he reached out, Fourier's hand could not grasp Suzy's arm.

He found himself grasping at air, unable to catch Suzy.

<b>

"W-What? What is this? Huh?"

<b>

Fourier could not understand what was happening.

Had something happened to him? Was he seeing some kind of illusion? He stared at his own hand that he pulled back.

<b>

"Please, escape… Lord Fourier?"

"Ugh!"

<b>

Suzy spoke coldly with her awakened eyes.

Fourier was intimidated by the look in Suzy's eyes, his words caught in his throat.

Those deep cobalt green eyes stirred up an unfathomable anxiety within him, causing him to step back.

<b>

However, Fourier felt irritated that his body had unconsciously retreated and that he felt fear.

What was he afraid of against such a young girl?!

<b>

"You! You will regret this! Tch! Magock! Let's go!!"

<b>

Fourier, with irritation, spat out a parting remark and turned away, leading his attendants away from the scene.

<b>

Trevor immediately bowed his head to the people of Amukamu, saying, "Excuse me!" and returned to the knight order's temporary lodgings.

<b>

He said he intended to head into the forest alone.

He would return to inform the class leaders of the situation and leave the rest to them.

After that, he wanted to join the Amukamu team entering the forest.

August welcomed this and sent him off.

<b>

After sending Trevor off, August turned to Suzy and spoke.

<b>

"…Suzy."

<b>

Suzy met August's gaze and nodded, then tilted her head to ask Anna Mary, who was standing next to her.

<b>

"Anna Mary, can you go get my equipment right away?"

"Don't worry, my lady; your belongings are already at Amukamu House."

<b>

Anna Mary bowed slightly beside Suzy and answered smoothly.

<b>

"I will have your preparations ready for you in 15 minutes."

"Thank you, Anna Mary. August, I will visit the first post in 30 minutes."

<b>

At Suzy's words, August stepped forward.

<b>

"Suzy… please, please take care of the head of the order…"

<b>

Alphonse and Silence also added, "Please, Suzy. We're counting on you, my lady," following August.

Suzy smiled at the three and simply replied, "Yes."

<b>

Then Suzy faced Sonia.

<b>

"Suzy… please take care of that person… Howard."

<b>

Sonia took Suzy's hand and spoke as if praying.

<b>

"Don't worry, Mama Sonia. I will bring back Papa Howard, who has been making you lonely with his work. Please wait in peace, okay?"

<b>

With that, Suzy tilted her head and smiled sweetly.

<b>

Thank you for reading.
