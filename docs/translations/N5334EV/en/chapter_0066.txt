# 61 A Visit from Marsh Cowsbert

I'll take it! Is this how it's going to be?"

<blank>

I put my hands on my hips and exhaled contentedly in front of the large breakfast prepared in the kitchen.

<blank>

Scrambled eggs and thick cut bacon. Amkamboa rose stew and honey toast.

<blank>

The actual cooking was done by the head chef of the Amcam House....

The food was for nearly 100 people. I helped with the serving.

<blank>

I would have liked to help out with the serving, but the work in the AMCAM house has settled down and the maids have freed up their hands, so they have all come over here to help.

<blank>

I don't even need to come out...stay back...shh shh shh....

I lost my job as the "diner's signature girl." ......

<blank>

Well, I was also told by Sonia-mama and AnnaMarie not to show myself in front of the Knights more than necessary....

I am currently unemployed....

<blank>

But there is plenty of work to be done behind the scenes.

<blank>

In short, we can work out of sight of our customers!

I help with the cooking like this! There's also prepping, setting out the plates, cleaning up, and washing dishes!

<blank>

If you are indoors, you can do laundry and cleaning!

<blank>

But if the maids catch you doing that, they will suddenly take away your job...!

<blank>

Still, when I see a gap, I find a job and do it! Uhi!

<blank>

<blank>

I found a laundry job like that, and when I finished spreading and hanging out the laundry to fill the plaza on the south side of the east wing and stretched out comfortably, a familiar figure caught my eye.

<blank>

"Mr. Marsh? What are you doing here so early?"

<blank>

There he was, Marsh Cowsbert, head of the blacksmithing workshop in Copetown.

<blank>

Oh! It's Cloud's missus, isn't it? What's up? Helping out in the village?"

<blank>

'Yes, I am...what is it Marsh? ...... perhaps a delivery of weapons and armor?"

<blank>

Mr. Marsh was carrying a large leather bag, which he had slung over his right shoulder.

Hmm? But not a lot of luggage for a delivery?

<blank>

"Yeah? Well, that's about it... oh, and just in time, young lady, do you know where the Knights are?"

We have a temporary accommodation at the end of the east wing here....

That's great. Please, girl."

<blank>

Apparently, Mr. Marsh has an errand for someone in the logistics unit, not the Knights themselves.

<blank>

I had a little help with something early last fall... and I'm here to see how it turned out."

<blank>

Come to think of it, you were in King's Landing for about two months last year.

<blank>

Mr. Marsh said he came to check on the quality of the work he had done at that time.

He said that when the Knights arrived in Copetown, they didn't have much time, so they asked him to come and see them after they settled in at the Amcam House.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Well, there's more work to be done than that...' Oh! There he is! Hey! Fred!

What...?" Ah! Rev. Cowsbert! You came?

<blank>

As we approached the tent that the Knights had set up as a simple storage facility, Mr. Marsh raised his hand and called out to someone who was in front of the tent.

<blank>

The person called Mr. Fred did not wear leather jackets, boots, or gloves like the others in the Order.

Instead, he was dressed in khaki-colored, tuna-like clothing and leather boots.

He wears a black psychedelic patterned bandana around his black head like a beehive, and he has great stubble around his rounded chin.

Are his blue droopy eyes a little droopy? Maybe he's not sleeping well because his dark circles are great?

<blank>

What is this guy? What's with this outfit? It doesn't look like a futanjie, does it?

The way he was scratching his head with the pen in his hand and checking the documents in the binder in the other hand, he is a mechanic himself!

<blank>

Fred raised his hand, which was holding a pen, to greet Mr. Marsh.

<blank>

Thank you for your hospitality, Rev. Cauzbert! I had it for you!"

<blank>

After saying this, he walked up to Mr. Marsh and held both of his hands, shaking them up and down and talking to him happily.

<blank>

We have made adjustments to the Master's remaining Type 4 Kai, and it is now successfully in operation as a Kaiji! Please take a look at it!

<blank>

What? What? What is it? What's that word you're spitting out that's even more inappropriate for fantasy?

Type 4? Kaiji?

Gale? Anchor? You want to say, "What's that word?

<blank>

At first, I was planning to leave immediately after showing Mr. Marsh around, but curiosity got the better of me and we ended up at the entrance to the tent together.

Because what is it that they call Type 4 or Kaiji?

What on earth did you make? I can't sleep at night because I'm curious! Hey, you know what?

<blank>

When I reached the front of the tent, Mr. Magritte and Mr. Djimon came out from inside.

<blank>

Princess? What are you doing here? You've come to the wrong place!

<blank>

When Mr. Magritte found me, Fred's eyes widened for a moment and he said, "Princess?　But Mr. Djimon told me not to make too much noise.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The reason why Mr. Magritte and his team are here is that Mr. Magritte, who is the commander of the advance unit that precedes the main body of the Knights and plays a key role in the unit's advance, is also in charge of overall logistics.

<blank>

He told me that it was Mr. Magritte who visited Mr. Marsh in Copetown on his way to Amkam and asked for him.

<blank>

I'm so glad you could make it, Mr. Cowsbert. Chief Loring has been anxiously awaiting your arrival.

<blank>

Mr. Marsh was shaking hands with Mr. Magritte and Mr. Djimon.

Fred Loring, who was Mr. Marsh's technical instructor when he was in King's Landing, is the chief of maintenance for the logistics unit.

In other words, he is one of Mr. Marsh's disciples.

<blank>

I was just about to go through the items that have been serviced to make sure they are in working order. Thank goodness! Now we can check with Rev. Cauzbert!"

<blank>

"Oh, that's good timing, isn't it? Then let's have a quick look!"

<blank>

Confirmation of operation? Is that a Type 4 or something? The one they're calling the "second revision"?

What in the world is that about? I want to see! I want to see! I want to see it!

<blank>

"What? You want to see it too, missy?"

<blank>

Mr. Marsh looked at me and said.

Was it on my face? I felt like I had a very curious and greedy look on my face... I felt a little embarrassed.

<blank>

Seeing my embarrassment, Mr. Marsh smiled and asked Magritte and the others to confirm the visit.

<blank>

Mr. Magritte smiled and gave me permission....

The gentle look in her eyes, as if she was looking at something smiling, stimulated my sense of shame even more, and I felt heat on my cheeks.

<blank>

<blank>

With Mr. Magritte's permission, I will be joining you all.

The place to go is the training hall in the east wing.

<blank>

The east wing, which is connected to the main building of Amkamu House, was originally the quarters of the knights and soldiers who served the castle during the Amkamu domain.

The facilities that were there remain as they were in that era and are still in use today.

<blank>

I hear that is a much sturdier construction than the training hall at the school.

The grade-holders also use it often, so we can see that it is a very good product.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I arrived in front of the training hall, I found a ragged-looking human-like mass writhing on a bench in front of the entrance, seemingly out of breath.

<blank>

If you look closely, you will see that it is Mr. Kyle, one of the knights you met yesterday!

<blank>

Why in such a place and in such a state?

<blank>

I ran up to him and tried to talk to him, but....

Both Mr. Magritte and Mr. Djimon quickly looked away, pretending they had not seen him, and walked quickly past him.

Marsh and Fred were not bothered by the original and were chatting and laughing as they droned on.

<blank>

...Hmmm, should I just pretend I didn't see this at ......?

<blank>

I don't have any particularly bad injuries, and I've probably been working out like crazy since this morning. I'm sure he'll regain his strength if he rests for a while.

<blank>

That's right! It's embarrassing for a girl to see you in tatters, isn't it? Well, let's pretend we didn't see this!

That's what a 'caring girl' is!

Duh! I'll pretend I didn't see that! I'll do that!

<blank>

I was a little taken back, but I followed the others into the training hall building.

<blank>

<blank>

At the end of a 10-meter-long corridor with locker rooms and shower rooms, a thick, large, martial double-opening door is opened to enter the training hall.

The size of the training hall is about 30 x 30 meters.

I guess it's the size of a two-court indoor tennis field.

<blank>

In the middle of it, about 20 backpack-like objects were neatly arranged on the ground.

<blank>

Someone was carrying one of them on his back to see how the backpack was carrying him.

He wears cuirasses, shin guards, and a leather jacket, so you can tell he is a member of the Order.

Mr. Magritte was calling on that person.

<blank>

They are going to check the operation now! Mr. Cowsbert! Please come closer!

<blank>

Ms. Magritte raised her voice and called for Mr. Marsh.

<blank>

"Tony, can you start us off?"

<blank>

The one called Tony nodded lightly as Fred, who had gone behind the back of the backpack and was checking something, spoke to him.

This backpack also looks a little different from ordinary ones when you look at it closely.

I wonder if the material isn't cloth, too. It is not lumpy and feels much more rigid than cloth.

It looks somewhat like a space suit backpack.

You can see a sword...perhaps a nightsword...sticking out of the left side of the backpack. Isn't it difficult to pull it out in that position?

<blank>

The straps extending from the shoulders are also much thicker than normal.

The chest strap that stops the chest is also thicker and has a large circular piece where it intersects with the shoulder strap on the left side.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that there is a magical bead embedded in the center of the part.... Hmm? No, is that a ...... control bead?

<blank>

The straps that fasten around the waist are also very thick and metallic.

It's kind of like a la0dder belt...?

<blank>

When I tried to get closer to get a better look, Mr. Djimon stopped me about a meter away and told me to wait here.

Fred also stepped down and nodded toward Tony.

<blank>

Heavy Mobile Magic Armor Deployment

<blank>

Tony placed his hand on the control bead on his chest and as he chanted, the control bead glowed. Magic power was poured into it.

<blank>

At the same time as the cyan-blue light enveloped the area, the backpack on his back opened and broke into several pieces, covering Tony's body!

<blank>

In the chest! On the abdomen! To the thighs! To the waist! On the arms! On the shoulders!

As you look at it, its body is covered with heavy armor!

Finally, the head!

Crushers extend and close around the mouth from both sides!

Parts covered the face afterwards, like a full-face helmet.

<blank>

When the light subsided, the knight in full plate heavy armor was there!

<blank>

<blank>

What is it? 

I'm blown away... ！！！！

<blank>

<blank>

Tony's left arm was fitted with a kite shield.

The sharp end is the elbow side, the open end is the wrist side.

The hilt of a nightsword protruding from a kite shield is visible on the back of the left wrist.

He slowly pulled it out with his right hand and slashed the sky with it.

He continued to show one or two kata of swordsmanship, and then stopped moving.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

My mouth has been wide open since a while ago, as if my jaw had fallen off!

Even their eyes are wide open!

<blank>

I used to make this face at Bibi and the others! I never thought I would be the one to do it!

I am well aware that I am not a hashtag to look like this! But you know what? But, but!

<blank>

Is this the Type 4? Is this the second revision?

Is this possible? Is this possible?

<blank>

This! How could it be a power suit?

This way of wearing it is like the iron man of famous American comic heroes, isn't it? Or the teachers who wear flaming red roses on their chests?

Where did he go? 

<blank>

No, but the finish is definitely heavy full plate armor, right?

The left breast toco has a beautiful blue control pearl shining on it, but it's proper armor!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Hmmm... a beta alloy of mithril and magic titanium... The mithril comes from... the Mine Mine east of King's Landing, right? Did they keep costs down by mining in nearby mines?"

Yes, we have reduced the quality of the materials, but we have succeeded in increasing the magic conductivity to 80% of the original. This is a practical value. Mass production has also become possible from a cost standpoint.

<blank>

Mr. Marsh started a technical conversation with Fred while he was conking and stroking the armor.

<blank>

It seems that this was a normal behavior for everyone, and I seem to be the only one who is peeling my eyes away from what just happened in front of my eyes.... Seriously!

<blank>

Princess...are you surprised?"

<blank>

I was stunned, but Mr. Magritte approached me as if to ask me a question.

<blank>

Unlike the heavily armed guardian knights who play a key role in the defense of bases, we mobile heavy knights, who are constantly marching on the front lines and frontiers, cannot always wear heavy equipment. However, it is this heavy mobile magic armor that allows the knights to maintain their strength without reducing our original mobility.

<blank>

That's how Magritte explained it to me.

<blank>

The gloves and boots I normally wear really became hand and shin guards as they were.

The pilot jacket-like jacket and leather pants are said to serve as under armor and help cushion the impact.

<blank>

Mr. Marsh was still talking with Fred.

I recovered from my daze and thought that I would only be intruding if I stayed here any longer, so I told Mr. Magritte I was leaving...

<blank>

I'm sorry, miss! Can you tell your husband that I'll start the maintenance today? Tell him I'll have him back in service by the end of the day tomorrow!

<blank>

He asked Mr. Marsh to take a message to Papa Howard.

You also mentioned that you would be staying here for a couple of days, so I'm wondering if there is anything else to maintain besides this place.

<blank>

Oops, before I knew it, it was already time to start preparing for lunch.

I will pass on Mr. Marsh's message to Papa Howard when I deliver lunch later.

<blank>

I thanked everyone for their hospitality and left.

<blank>

Marsh and Fred's excited voices echoed in the training hall until the big door was closed.

----------------

Ughhhhhh ...... not enough Sue-chan ingredients...!

I just finished my ordeal, and now I can't come back to school for a while?"

I can't help it, the village is going through a difficult time right now... she's a hard worker."

'This is an opportunity! As the daughter of the head of Amkam! "I hope you will take this opportunity!"

"Well, I don't know. She's not very good at that sort of thing, and she's very slow.

"Ughhhhh...Sue, I want to hold you so bad..."

I know..." "Right..! Sigh~...! We still have to cover for them!"

It's the job of the three families to follow up on the head of the family anyway, isn't it?"

I'm sure you're right! That's right!"

"Ughhh~~~...... Sue, I... want to be a pussy..."

And Sue trusts Bibi a lot more than we do. She's counting on Bibi, so why don't you help her out?

Oh, my God! Well, yes! Well, maybe you're right! I can't help it if they ask me! It's the duty of the Kuroki family!

Bibi, you're smiling. If you're so happy to be asked to do something, why don't you just say you're happy? Ha ha!

Ni! The one that isn't grinning!"

"Ugh～～～～...... Sue, I want to...sniff you..."

"Anta! You've been totally unwavering since the last time I saw you!

UGH～～～～～....Sue-chan..."

I was thinking... "Oh, by the way! When we had dinner together yesterday! You said something about having some free time this afternoon!"

I don't see why not. Well, then, with your permission, why don't we go to Sue's this afternoon?

Oh? That's good! I wanted to see the Knights of King's Landing up close, too! Let's go, let's go, let's go! Let's go, let's go!

"Uu~~~...Sue-chan...hmm? What? Are you going to Sue's place? I'm going with you! I'm coming!

I'm sure you're right..! Sue's campaign visit and helping out...! Now, that's something I can't get enough of!

"Done! Then I'll go and get the doctor's permission."

When you're done with your meal! Let's head straight over!"

I'm looking forward to the afternoon! Hehe, I'm starting to look forward to this afternoon!"

Yeah! Sue-chan, wait for me! I'll be right back to give you a tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle!

I'm going to go to ...... and see what I can find! You're really not blinking, are you!"
