# 115 Nightmare Head

Please note that there are some cruel descriptions.

 --------------------

The sound of a man placing a hard object on an old wooden table echoes in the narrow stone room.

<blank>

Hey, don't put that there.

<blank>

The other man in the room opens his eyes in surprise and looks at the object on the table.

He then raised his voice sharply at those who carried it.

<blank>

"Oh? "Oh, it doesn't matter, does it? We're not detecting any dangerous magical reactions.

That said, it's not very pleasant.

"Really? Nothing particularly odd about that, right?"

<blank>

Gorged, silvery egg-like shape.

It looks like a lump of silver, but the surface is very dull.

It is rough to the touch and not very pleasant to the touch.

<blank>

<blank>

This is a town called Palouse, about 20 km north of Dekenbel.

The men were in the basement of the city's guardhouse, where the guards were waiting to monitor the prison.

<blank>

In the room, which is also adjacent to the prison interrogation room, two guards were spending the late evening with one of the pieces of evidence in front of them.

There are three men on duty, but one is currently patrolling the prison, so these two men are the only ones in the room.

<blank>

I try to admonish my colleague for his careless handling of evidence, but this guard blows such advice out of the water to fill the time he now has.

<blank>

After all, the two interrogators still in the next room, when they had just measured the magic of this thing, had said, "We recognize some mysterious magic retention, but it doesn't seem to be anything particularly urgent.

<blank>

But that doesn't mean I have permission to take you out of the case. Get them back there now."

It's all right! I'll just take a look. I'm not going to drop you."

It's obvious! Just put it away!"

<blank>

It's not as heavy as it looks. Is the surface rough, almost like lizard skin or something?"

"So put it away and ......"

Ow!

<blank>

Hey, what's up?"

"My thumb is ...... ugh on something!"

Let me see." Wow! That's a hell of a lot of blood!"

<blank>

When I looked, I saw that the man had made a straight horizontal groove on the belly of his thumb, as if he had carved it out with a carving knife, and that the flesh there had been scraped off.

<blank>

What's up?" What's all the fuss?"

I've come to the right place." "Hey, get me some gauze from that shelf over there! Get me some gauze from that shelf over there to stop the bleeding!"

<blank>

Just then, another guard who had been out on patrol returned.

But he calls out quizzically to his noisy colleagues, but his eyes widen when he sees the blood overflowing onto his desk.

<blank>

What? Ugh! What's with the blood? Hold on a second!

The wound is pretty deep. The flesh on the belly of your thumb is a little gouged out."

Here, hold him down with this."

I'm sorry," he said. Here, hold it like this. How does that feel? Does it hurt?"

Oh, it's starting to hurt slowly. ...... Chickenshit."

<blank>

'Wow, there's blood all over the evidence! ...... why is this stuff out here?"

Hey! Don't touch that! You'll get hurt, too, if you touch it!"

"Hmm? What? What's wrong with this? ...... Whoa!"

<blank>

What's wrong? Are you hurt too?

Yes, no, something about this guy, like he just moved ......

What? It moved? ...... Wow!"

<blank>

One of the guards looked at the eggs and his eyes widened and he screamed loudly.

On its surface, I saw a vein-like streak the size of a man's finger begin to emerge and pulsate.

<blank>

It's not good! Hurry up and put it in the case! Lock the magic seal!"

<blank>

The guards lost color and screamed at the impossible change caused by the silver egg and the unusual atmosphere exuding from it.

<blank>

The egg thumped like a bare heart beating fast! Thump, thump, thump! and the contraction repeats with a violent pulsation.

In terms of time, it is a mere five or six seconds. But to the three guards watching, it seems like an eternity.

<blank>

The repeated pulsations felt as if they were echoing from the depths of the earth, and the vibrations seemed to be transmitted to my lower abdomen. The vibrations seem to be transmitted to my lower abdomen.

Furthermore, when it felt as if a terrible, foul-smelling miasma filled the room, making it difficult to even breathe.

<blank>

Sole shook his head.

<blank>

And -------- --

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The two investigators, who were still working in the interrogation room, opened their eyes to the changes they sensed in the adjoining room.

At the same time that I felt an unusual release of magical energy, multiple screams were clearly coming from the next room.

<blank>

The two hold short swords for self-defense in their hands and draw their double-edged blades.

Then they nodded to each other, and one of them put his head against the door to look for signs of the outside.

Judging that there was no sign of movement outside, I quietly opened the door a little and looked outside.

<blank>

I don't see anyone outside."

Any sign of the bandits?

I can't judge from here. I'm going to go to the next room to see what's going on."

Stay alert. You take the room, I'll take the hallway. I'll watch the hallway."

Roger that.

<blank>

While one of us was on guard in the corridor, the other leaned against the door of the guard's waiting room. While one of them was on guard duty in the corridor, the other one leaned in close to the door of the guard's waiting room.

I peeked inside through the small opening, but could not see anything unusual. I could not see any guards who were supposed to be in this waiting room.

When I opened the door a little wider to see what was going on inside, the man holding the door jerked his hand to a stop! The man holding the door stopped.

<blank>

"Ugh!

What's wrong? What's going on?

<blank>

To the exclaiming man, the other man asks in a quiet voice.

<blank>

What's that?" This eating mess: ......"

<blank>

But the man's attempt to answer the question is cut short before he can tell all.

The man's head disappeared and his body collapsed in place, spewing blood from it.

<blank>

Nah?

<blank>

The suddenness of the event almost made him scream, but he pushed it away and the man jumped back as quickly as he could.

<blank>

But at the moment of landing, he loses his balance and rolls there.

The man has no idea what happened.

He should have landed on the ground with both feet, but he did not feel his right foot touch the ground.

<blank>

As I rolled on the ground, I looked down at my feet to see what had happened, and saw that my right leg had disappeared from the knee down, and blood was gushing out of it.

<blank>

A series of events occurred suddenly, and I could not keep up with my understanding.

The man looked around, breathing hard like a fish washed up on land, scratching algae in the pool of blood he had created, and looking around without understanding what was going on.

<blank>

And then I noticed the thing there.

<blank>

Wiggle your silvery body around and see what slowly approaches you.

It made a sound as if a crack in the flesh was widening, and showed countless needle-like fangs that stood in a forest inside, and then came crawling toward us.

<blank>

The last thing the man saw was the mouth, which was wide open and seemed to be closed to the darkness.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The door to the room opens slightly with a creaking sound.

In the room is a crude desk and some chairs.

Then there was one figure, strapped into a sturdily constructed chair.

<blank>

His face was swollen beyond recognition, and his exposed upper body was covered with brand-new bruises and countless cuts.

That is clearly the appearance of a tortured person.

As if to prove this point, a number of tools for such work are lined up on the desk.

<blank>

It was the figure of a man once called "Masuka" by his friends.

<blank>

The person who felt the presence of something entering the room muttered something in his mouth.

<blank>

"I already told you everything. ...... I don't know ...... any more."

<blank>

He looks clearly frightened and repeats a small "I don't know" in his mouth.

<blank>

The sole that entered the room took no heed of such mutterings and bit the ankle without hesitation.

<blank>

I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! Ggh! Gyaaaah! Geeeeaaaahhhh!

<blank>

Screams echo through the room, accompanied by the sound of flesh being devoured.

<blank>

Around the same time the screams were rising, screams began to rise from the four underground prisons.

<blank>

Oh, my leg! My leg!

Stop it! Stop itoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

Get me out of here! Get me out of here ......aaaagh!"

<blank>

Every corner of the basement is filled with screams of despair and fear, and the smell of blood and miasma fills the air.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A shadow swayed in the depths of the basement, where muffled screams and moans could be heard amidst the reverberating sounds of flesh being devoured here and there.

<blank>

I came here and saw that you were eating here. I came here when I felt you start to move, and here you are, eating in a place like this."

<blank>

The blue and indigo drapes swayed and the glossy brown thighs split the shadows.

<blank>

I left it with you to use in case of emergency, but I can't believe I woke you up in a place like this. ...... Ummm...does that add up to anything?"

<blank>

Her hair, black as darkness, spills silently, revealing the emerald eyes hidden behind them, which are squinted happily.

<blank>

'Well, if we use them, they will eat us together, so it makes no difference either way. Uh-huh. ......"

<blank>

The brown-skinned woman, with a rich brown fruit about to spill out from the bosom of her wide-open blue-blue dress, extended her slender fingertips toward the silver demon approaching at her feet.

Then Sole slides herself into the woman's brown hand with satisfaction and begins to curl around her fingertips happily.

<blank>

Have you eaten back a little of the edge? I see."

<blank>

Several more demons gathered and rubbed themselves against the brown woman as if to pamper her.

<blank>

Oh?" Some of them are starting to get mixed up a little bit? Well, let's collect them, shall we?

<blank>

Her crimson mouth turns up slightly in amusement, as if she has heard something interesting.

<blank>

A hard thumping sound echoes on the cold floor of the basement, filled with death and silence, where not even the sound of moaning can be heard anymore.

The sound of countless earth-crawling sounds followed it as it moved through the closed stone walls, filled with the smell of sweltering blood.

<blank>

<blank>

Soon the echoes, along with the brown woman in the blue dress and the silvery demon, disappeared into the shadows as if they had never existed in the first place.

<blank>

All that remains is a cold stone wall, filled with the stench of fearful death, and pieces of devoured flesh lying in a pool of blood.

<blank>

5 ao month 11.

It was shortly after the date. It was a tragedy in the prison, in the guardhouse of the Palouse Guard.
