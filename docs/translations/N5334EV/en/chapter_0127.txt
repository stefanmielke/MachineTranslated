# 115th Chapter: Nightmare Head

※ There are cruel depictions, please be careful.

――――――――――――――――――――

The sound of a man placing a hard object on an old wooden table echoes in the stone-walled, narrow room.

<b>

"Hey, don't put that there."

<b>

The other man in the room opens his eyes wide in surprise and looks at the object placed on the table.

He then sharply raises his voice at the one who placed it there.

<b>

"What? It's not a big deal, right? There's no particularly dangerous magical reaction detected."

"Even so, that's not something pleasant."

"Is that so? There's nothing particularly strange about it, right?"

<b>

A rounded, silver egg-like shape.

It looks like a lump of silver, but the surface is quite dull.

When touched, it feels rough and is not something that gives a good sensation.

<b>

<b>

This is the town called Palus, located about 20 kilometers north of Dekkenbel.

The men are in the underground waiting area of the town's guard station, where guards are stationed to monitor the prison.

<b>

In that room adjacent to the interrogation room of the prison, two guards were spending the late hours of the night in front of one of the evidence items.

There are three on duty, but one is currently patrolling inside the prison, leaving only these two men in the room.

<b>

Trying to admonish his colleague for handling the evidence carelessly, this guard is ignoring such advice to fill the idle time he has.

<b>

After all, the two interrogators in the next room, who are still conducting the interrogation, had just said when measuring the magical power of this item, "A mysterious magical power retention is recognized, but it doesn't seem to be something that requires immediate action."

<b>

"That said, you don't have permission to take it out of the case. Put it back quickly."

"Don't worry! I'm just taking a quick look. I won't drop it."

"Of course! Just put it away!"

<b>

"Hmm, it's not as heavy as it looks. The surface is rough, is it similar to the skin of a lizard or something?"

"That's why I said to put it away..."

"Ouch!"

<b>

"Hey, what happened?"

"My thumb got caught on something... ugh!?"

"Let me see! Whoa! That's some bad blood!"

<b>

Looking closely, a groove had formed horizontally on the pad of the man's thumb, as if it had been carved away with a chisel, and the flesh there had been scraped off.

<b>

"What happened? What's all the commotion?"

"Just in time! Hey! Grab some gauze for stopping the bleeding from that shelf!"

<b>

Just then, another guard who had been on patrol returned.

However, he suspiciously asks his noisy colleagues, but upon seeing the blood spilled on the table, his eyes widen.

<b>

"What the hell? Whoa! What happened to all that blood?! Just wait a second!"

"That's quite a deep wound. The pad of your thumb is a bit gouged."

"Here, hold this to stop the bleeding."

"Sorry. Just hold it like this. How does it feel? Does it hurt?"

"Yeah, it's starting to throb... damn."

<b>

"Whoa, the evidence is covered in blood! ...Why is this here?"

"Hey! Don't touch that! If you handle it carelessly, you'll get hurt too!"

"Huh? What? Is there something wrong with this? ...Whoa!!"

<b>

"What happened?! Did you get hurt too?!"

"N-no, it felt like it moved just now..."

"Huh? Moved? ...Whoa!!"

<b>

One of the guards stared at the egg, eyes wide, and shouted loudly.

He had witnessed a vein-like line, as thick as a man's finger, rising to the surface and beginning to pulse.

<b>

"This is bad! Quickly put it back in the case! Lock the magical seal!"

<b>

The silver egg caused an unimaginable change, and the unusual presence seeping from it made the guards lose their color and scream.

<b>

The egg throbbed like an exposed heart speeding up its beat, thump! thump! contracting and pulsating violently.

In terms of time, it was only a matter of 5 to 6 seconds. But for the three guards watching, it felt like an eternity.

<b>

The repeated throbbing felt as if it resonated from the depths of the earth, transmitting vibrations down to their lower abdomen. It echoed deep within their eardrums.

Furthermore, a foul, fishy miasma seemed to fill the room, making even breathing hesitate.

<b>

It then raised its head.

<b>

And――――――――――

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The two investigators continuing their work in the interrogation room opened their eyes wide at the change they sensed from the next room.

At the same time they felt an abnormal release of magical power, they clearly heard multiple screams coming from the adjacent room.

<b>

The two held their short swords for self-defense, drawing their double-edged blades.

Nodding to each other, one pressed his ear to the door to sense the presence outside.

Determining there was no movement outside, he quietly opened the door slightly to peek outside.

<b>

"There's no one outside."

"Any signs of intruders?"

"I can't tell from here. Let's go check the next room."

"Don't let your guard down. You watch inside. I'll keep an eye on the hallway."

"Understood."

<b>

While one was on guard in the hallway, the other leaned against the door of the guard's waiting room. Peeking inside while holding the doorknob, he slowly pulled it to create a narrow gap.

Peering through the small opening, he saw nothing particularly unusual in the visible area. He couldn't even confirm the presence of the guards who should be in this waiting room.

As he tried to check the inside a bit more, when he opened the door wider and could see inside, the hand of the man holding the door suddenly froze.

<b>

"Ugh!?"

"What happened? What is it?!"

<b>

The man, speechless, was questioned in a small voice by the other.

<b>

"What is this mess...?"

<b>

However, the man's words, trying to answer that question, were cut off before he could convey everything.

His neck vanished, and blood gushed from it as his body collapsed to the ground.

<b>

"What the...?!"

<b>

About to scream at the sudden event, he suppressed it and instinctively jumped back.

<b>

However, at the moment of landing, he lost his balance and fell over.

The man had no idea what had just happened.

Though he should have landed on both legs, he felt no contact with his right foot on the ground.

<b>

As he lay on the ground, looking down at his feet to understand what had happened, he saw that the lower part of his right leg had vanished, blood gushing from the wound.

<b>

Unable to comprehend the sudden series of events, the man gasped for breath like a fish washed ashore, flailing in his own pool of blood, looking around in confusion.

<b>

And then he noticed the thing that was there.

<b>

A silver body writhing, slowly approaching him.

It made a sound like flesh tearing apart, exposing countless needle-like fangs within, and crawled closer.

<b>

The last thing the man saw was that gaping, dark mouth, wide open.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

The door to the room creaked open slightly.

Inside the room, there was a shabby desk and several chairs.

And there was a person tied to a sturdy chair.

<b>

The person's face was so swollen that its original shape was unrecognizable, and there were fresh bruises and countless cuts all over the exposed upper body.

It was clearly the figure of someone being tortured.

To prove this, numerous tools for such work were lined up on the desk.

<b>

That was the figure of a man who was once called "Masuka" by his comrades.

<b>

Feeling a presence entering the room, he muttered something softly in his mouth.

<b>

"I-I already told you everything... I don't know anything more..."

<b>

Clearly frightened, he repeatedly muttered "I don't know" softly.

<b>

The thing that had invaded the room paid no heed to such murmurs, biting down on his ankle without hesitation.

<b>

"Ughhh! I don't know! I don't know!! Gah! Aah! Aahhh!!!"

<b>

The sound of flesh being torn apart echoed in the room, accompanied by the screams.

<b>

At the same time the screams rose, screams began to emerge from the four cells in the underground.

<b>

"My leg! My leg is gone!!"

"Stop! Please stop!!"

"Let me out! Get me out of here... Aahhh!!!"

<b>

The underground was filled with the dying screams and terrified cries, the smell of blood and the stench of decay permeating the air.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Amidst the echoes of flesh being torn apart, faint screams and groans could be heard from deep within the underground, where a shadow swayed.

<b>

"Oh? I felt a movement, so I came to see you were having a meal here."

<b>

The blue drapery swayed, revealing the alluring brown thighs that split the shadows.

<b>

"I entrusted you to be useful in times of need, yet you woke up in a place like this... Hehe, did it help a little?"

<b>

The dark hair, as black as the night, flowed down, revealing emerald eyes that sparkled with amusement.

<b>

"Well, since if you use it, you'll be devoured along with it, it's all the same anyway. Hehehe..."

<b>

The brown-skinned woman, with her blue dress wide open at the chest, seemed about to spill her rich bounty as she approached the silver creature at her feet, extending her slender fingers towards it.

Then it rubbed against her brown hand contentedly, beginning to wrap around her fingertips playfully.

<b>

"Did the 'leftover' eat a bit? Is that so?"

<b>

More creatures gathered, rubbing against the brown woman as if seeking her affection.

<b>

"Oh? Was there a bit that started to mix in? Then let's collect that."

<b>

Her crimson lips curled up slightly, as if she had heard something interesting.

<b>

The cold, silent floor of the underground, filled with death and silence, echoed with hard sounds.

Amidst the suffocating smell of blood, it moved between the closed stone walls, pursued by the sounds of countless creatures crawling along the ground.

<b>

<b>

Eventually, that sound, along with the brown woman in the blue dress and the silver creatures, melted into the shadows as if they had never existed there from the beginning.

<b>

What remained was the scattered pieces of flesh rolling in a vast pool of blood and the dreadful stench of death sealed within the cold stone walls.

<b>

On the 11th of the Fifth Moon.

It was shortly after the date changed. A tragedy unfolded in the Palus guard station, within the prison.
