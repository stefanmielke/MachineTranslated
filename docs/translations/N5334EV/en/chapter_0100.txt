# Episode 88: Lucille Moore's Melancholy

"I thought I had taken the upper hand, but the result was completely the opposite!"

<b>

Bibi said proudly.

<b>

"You have to set things straight from the beginning with those types! Amukam can't be underestimated! I made it so they came to greet us themselves!!"

"I see! Bibi! Well done!!"

<b>

While enjoying tea in the lounge, Carla and the others were praising Bibi as she reported on the events after the entrance ceremony.

<b>

"The difference in status between just a daughter and the next head is significant!"

<b>

At Bibi's words, Carla and the others became excited, and Anna-Mary and Mia nodded vigorously in agreement...

<b>

Please, Beatrice! Just spare me this!!

My face is burning so badly that I can't lift my head while holding my tea!!

<b>

"Well, with this, the largest faction has already formed among the new students."

"Huh? A, a faction?! The largest?!"

<b>

I couldn't help but raise my voice in surprise at the ominous word that slipped from Colin's mouth.

<b>

"There's always some sort of faction in every grade, big or small, right? It's not like there's a faction war like in politics, but you just gather around a specific girls' group saying, 'I'm part of this faction~'"

"I, I see... But..."

"I heard that the young lady of the Casper family is quite strong-willed even before enrollment, so I thought she might be proactive about forming factions~"

"She probably came with that intention, but I crushed that idea right away!!"

<b>

Scary... girls are scary... Bibi is really scary.

<b>

"With this, it's confirmed that the head of the largest faction among the new students is Sue... I guess."

"That's great! Bibi! As expected of you!!"

"Ueeeee...?"

"Well, once Sue's abilities become known, whether they like it or not, attention and people will gather around her. I wanted to avoid standing out at first, but it's just a matter of whether it's early or late."

"W, standing out... But, I was told to avoid standing out as much as possible when it comes to August..."

"That's until people firmly recognize you as part of Amukam! ...and as the next head!"

<b>

That's right, I was told by the top brass of Amukam, including August, to keep my power in check at school.

So even during the entrance exam, I had Bibi and Mia check on me to make sure I was holding back.

I was super careful during the physical fitness tests, both short and long-distance runs, and sparring, and I controlled my magical power to show decent results! (I think!! ...probably)

Because unlike before, I've learned to control my strength to be on par with normal kids now!

Yup! I can do it if I try!!

<b>

So why... did I end up standing out in a different way on the first day of school?!

I wanted to start a peaceful school life without standing out, you know? ...sniff sniff.

<b>

"Well! That's why! If I'm recognized as the head of the largest faction, that's a fortunate thing!!"

<b>

Bibi is really an aggressive woman, isn't she? She has that mischievous smile on her face...

Speaking of which, Silence sometimes had that kind of smile too.

Really, Bibi takes after her dad...

<b>

<b>

After returning to the dorm room, Karen asked me if anything happened in Group 1 today.

However, having just carved a new black history for myself, I dove into my bed and sank, pleading, "Please don't ask me right now!"

<b>

"That's why I said we should just leave it alone..."

"...By the way, Lady Cordelia, you were only second in the academic subjects..."

"Ah! L-Lucille? D-don't say such things now!!"

"Did you really not know? The Duke's rank is higher than the Count's..."

"Well... maybe I thought that...?"

"Then you barged in so confidently?"

"B-but! I didn't think you would be with us, did I?!!"

"You knew we were in the same class, right?"

"...Catherine... your words are harsh..."

"But Lady Cordelia blushing under Lord Cloud's gaze... was so precious..."

"Huh?"

"No, nothing."

"...Catherine, let's keep it moderate... okay?"

<b>

As the three of them chatted noisily while walking down the hallway, Lucille Moore admonished Catherine Moore.

No matter how much she was warned, Catherine always acted as if she didn't care.

Lucille sighed at her cousin of the same age but had long since given up on trying to change her ways.

However, at the very least, she wished Catherine would refrain from speaking in front of the person involved.

<b>

After all, we are servants, and we should focus on elevating our master, Lady Cordelia, rather than using her as a topic of conversation.

Lucille always thought it was inappropriate, but Catherine never seemed to listen to her on this matter.

<b>

"Still, it's good that Lord Haggard was there. We got to see him up close... right? How was it, Lady Cordelia?"

"Uh? ...Y-yes, he was... dashing and truly a knight as the rumors say."

<b>

Seeing Cordelia blush slightly as she answered, Lucille sighed again.

Indeed, she was supposed to just go see Arvin Haggard, who is renowned as the top knight candidate among this year's new students.

It should have been enough to see him from a distance, but for some reason, Cordelia panicked when the door was closed and suddenly shouted loudly while banging on it.

This left both Lucille and Catherine with their jaws dropped in shock. How did it come to this?!

Nonetheless, both Lucille and Catherine had been serving Cordelia since childhood. They instinctively remembered to support their master in that moment. It was a reflex ingrained in them.

But even more astonishingly, Cordelia ended up challenging Beatrice Croki to a fight. A headache suddenly hit Lucille. Why did it have to come to this?!!

<b>

It was rumored that Arvin Haggard and Beatrice Croki were on friendly terms, and it could be considered that Cordelia's reckless act stemmed from a sense of rivalry with her.

Still... still! Cordelia's outbursts weren't new, but this time it was a bit too much. To mess up on the first day of school is just too much to ask. What did they think of her? I sincerely hope that Lady Cloud's last smile was genuine... no, I desperately hope so!

<b>

Why does this girl become so unbearable in such situations...?

Recalling this, Lucille felt a wave of dizziness and headache wash over her.

<b>

"By the way, Lucille, your magical power test was on the same day as the Amukam people, right? Cordelia and I had different schedules, so we didn't see it... How was it? Those people?"

"...Well, the Amukam people were a bit unique, I suppose..."

<b>

As Lucille Moore said this, she recalled the whispers about the Amukam princess that had circulated in the days since entering the dormitory.

<b>

Surrounded and protected by excellent individuals

She herself is excellent, but that's all

Compared to those around her, she falls short

<b>

The Amukam princess is beautiful and catches people's eyes wherever she goes.

Thus, many people are drawn to her, and even the slightest information spreads quickly.

<b>

Even if the truth of the stories heard is dubious, people tend to take the rumors at face value.

Even if it differs from the truth, it takes time for the initially spread rumor to be overwritten.

<b>

"Being surrounded by excellent individuals is good, but being compared to them is just unfortunate, to put it mildly."

<b>

Cordelia slightly opened the fan she was holding, hiding her mouth, and murmured with a small furrow of her brow.

<b>

"...Yes, that's true."

<b>

Lucille placed her hand on her hair and smoothed it down.

As if to tidy up hair that had been disheveled by a storm. And as if recalling something, a small shiver ran through her.

<b>

"Lucille? What happened?"

"No, Lady Cordelia, it's nothing."

<b>

Lucille turned to Cordelia with a gentle smile.

<b>

"I believe everyone will understand in time."

<b>

Thus, Lucille Moore quietly replied.
