# 88 The Melancholy of Lucille Moore

You thought you had it all mounted, but it turned out to be just the opposite!

<blank>

Bibi said with pride.

<blank>

We have to be the first to decide on that sort of thing! We can't afford to be licked by AMCAM! I've made myself look like I'm here to greet you!

I see." Bibi! Well done!!!!"

<blank>

While having tea in the lounge, Kara and her friends were raving about Bibi, who was reporting on the events after the entrance ceremony.

<blank>

There's a difference between a mere breathing woman and the next head of state!"

<blank>

Kara and the others fussed and fussed at Bibi's words, while AnnaMarie and Mia nodded their heads in agreement! and nodding grandly. ......

<blank>

Please, Beatrice. Please don't do this again!

My face burns so badly that I can't look up while holding my tea!

<blank>

Well, now we already have the largest faction of new students.

What about? Faction? Maximum?

<blank>

The disturbing words coming out of Colin's mouth made me turn my voice inside out to listen.

<blank>

Every grade level has its own factions," she said. It's not like in politics, where there are factions.

"So, it's ......? No, no! But ......"

I had heard before I enrolled that the Casper family is a strong-willed family, so I wondered if they were aggressive in forming factions. I had a feeling that they would be aggressive in forming factions.

I suppose you came here as a check! I've already destroyed it! I crushed it as fast as I could!

<blank>

Scary ......, girl scary ....... I'm scared of Bibi.

<blank>

I guess we can now confirm Sue as the head of the largest faction of new students .......

'Erai! Bibi! It's Sasuga!

"Oooooohhhhhh ............?"

I didn't want to make a big show of it at the beginning, but it's only a matter of time before people see it. I didn't want to be noticed at the beginning, but it's only the difference between being late and being early.

I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'd like to tell Mr. August to refrain from doing anything too obvious ....... But I told Mr. Augusto to try to refrain from showing off ......."

That's you, AmCam! He said ......! You're the next head of AMCAM! You're the next head of AMCAM!

<blank>

Yes, Mr. August and other top Amcam officials had told us to keep our power as low as possible at the school.

So even during the entrance exam, I was checked by Bibi and Mia to keep in mind to save my strength.

I was very careful in the long and short distance running for physical fitness tests, and in the standing competition, and even in the measurement of magic power, I showed a good result by controlling it completely! (I'm sure! (...... maybe)

Because unlike in the past, I can now control my power like a normal child!

Un! I'm a can-do girl!

<blank>

So why would ...... make you stand out in a different direction on your first day of school?

I wanted to start my school life discreetly and peacefully, you know? ...... shikshikshikshik.

<blank>

I'm not sure I want to go back to the old days! That's why! I'm just happy to be recognized as the head of the largest faction!

<blank>

Bibi, you are an aggressive woman to no end. She's got some kind of evil smile on her face. ......

Come to think of it, Mr. Silence used to smile like that from time to time.

Really, Bibi is just like his dad. ......

<blank>

<blank>

After returning to my dorm room, Karen asked me if anything happened in the first group today.　I was asked something like.

But I had just made a new black history!　and I dove into bed and sank to the ground.

<blank>

'So let's not do it. ......, you said.'

"...... generally, Mr. Cordelia, the only time you were next in line was in the classroom, and ......

"! ...... Lucille, Lucille? Don't say that now!

I'm sure you didn't know that. The Count of the Frontier has a higher title than the Count of ......."

"............ so maybe it was ...... at least? ............"

And yet you went in with such a bullish attitude?"

Because..." You don't think I'm with you?

You knew we were in the same class, right?"

"...... Katherine ......, that's a harsh way to put it ......."

But Cordelia was blushing as Cloud-sama stared at her ...... and said, "You're so precious ......."

What about?"

No, nothing.

"...... Catherine, let's not go overboard ......, okay?"

<blank>

As the three of us walked adulterously down the hallway, Lucille Moore chided Catherine Moore.

No matter how many warnings I give her, Catherine always seems to be in the wind.

Lucille sighs at this cousin of her age, but has long since given up meddling in her hobby.

But at least refrain from speaking in front of the person in question.

<blank>

I have always thought that since we are servants, we should focus on supporting our master, Cordelia, and not making a side dish for her, but Catherine would not listen to me.

<blank>

Still, it was nice to see you there too, Mr. Haggard. It was nice to see you so close to ......, wasn't it? How was it? Mr. Cordelia."

What? ......Yes, he was ......, he was a gallant man, a knightly man, as they say."

<blank>

Lucille sighed again when she saw Cordelia respond with a slight flush on her cheeks.

Yes, I was originally supposed to have just gone to see Irving Haggard, who is renowned as the best candidate for knighthood among this year's new students.

Cordilia, who should have been seen from a distance but somehow got nervous when the door was closed, suddenly shouted loudly and slammed the door open.

Lucille, of course, and Catherine, too, were stunned by this! Her mouth dropped open as if her jaw had been dislocated. How did that happen?

Still, both Lucille and Catherine have been Cordelia's attendants since childhood. They never forget to support and assist their hostess on the spur of the moment. It can be called an ingrained spinal reflex.

Cordelia, however, had even put up a fight with Beatrice Kuroki before she knew it. A headache comes over me all at once. So how did that happen?

<blank>

Perhaps it was rumored that Irving Haggard and Beatrice Croquis were close friends, and Cordelia's outburst was due to the rivalry he felt toward her.

But still, ......, that's all the more reason to go for it! This is not the first time that Miss Cody has been out of control, but this time it's just a little too much. I hope she doesn't do it on her first day at school. What did they think? I hope Miss Cloud's smile at the end is not a backhanded one ...... No, I really hope so!

<blank>

Why is she so blind when it comes to that aspect of her life? ......

Lucille recalls feeling dizzy and her headache increasing.

<blank>

I was wondering, "Oh, by the way, Lucille, didn't you have your magic exam on the same day as the Amcam people? I and Lady Cordelia didn't see it because our dates were different. ...... How were they? How were they?"

"......Yes, the AmCam people were a little unique, weren't they......?"

<blank>

As she said this, Lucille Moore recalled the whispers whispered around her in the days since she had entered the dormitory about Amcam's reputation as a princess.

<blank>

Surrounded and protected by the best and brightest.

He's excellent, but that's all.

It's still comparable to its surroundings.

<blank>

Amcam's princesses are beautiful to look at, and they are always visible no matter where they are.

So many people are intrigued by him, and even a small amount of information spreads quickly.

<blank>

Even if the truth of a story is vague, people will believe the rumors that are spread.

Even if it is not true, it takes time for the rumors initially spread to be overwritten.

<blank>

It's all well and good to be surrounded by the best, but it's a pity to be compared to them.

<blank>

Cordelia opened the fan in her hand slightly, covered her mouth, and muttered this with a small furrowed brow.

<blank>

...... yeah, right."

<blank>

Lucille ran her hand through her own hair and stroked it.

It was as if she was adjusting her disheveled hair, exposed to the storm. Then, as if remembering something, a small shiver runs through me.

<blank>

"Lucille? What's wrong?"

No, Mr. Cordelia, it's nothing.

<blank>

Lucille gives Cordelia a soft smile.

<blank>

I'm sure you will all understand in time."

<blank>

So Lucille Moore quietly replied.
