# Chapter 183: Karen's Memory

"Thank you for coming today despite your busy schedules. As of today, I, Annie Cloud, have turned 8 years old."

<b>

On the stage stood Philip Cloud, the organizer, and his daughter, the star of the party, Annie Cloud, greeting the guests. Annie was in the midst of her costume changes and was now wearing a pure white fish-tail dress.

<b>

Karen and Cordelia felt an unintentional sense of pride as they watched their little friend behave so confidently in front of so many people.

Holding hands and watching her, the two might have developed a protective feeling towards Annie in place of Suzy, who was absent.

<b>

Bona Raven Casper, witnessing her daughter's slight growth, stood beside them, narrowing her eyes lovingly as she looked at her daughter.

Her gaze fell on the small stone that sparkled with golden light at Cordelia's chest.

<b>

"You've been keeping that close to you, haven't you, Cordy?"

"Ah, yes, Father! I can't wear it where it can be seen at the academy, but I always carry it with me!"

"That 'Blessing of Teril' was sent with my wishes for your safety. I’m very happy that you always wear it, Cordy. …That red stone of yours too, Karen. Leela sent it to you wishing for your well-being. Take good care of it."

"My mother… Thank you very much, Uncle Bona."

"I'll take good care of it too! Father!"

<b>

Dalton Banjo quietly joined his friends and their two daughters.

Annie's greeting on stage had ended, and the audience was applauding the girl, who took a beautiful bow.

<b>

After exchanging glances with Bona, Dalton nodded briefly at Philip on stage.

<b>

<b>

"Now, everyone! I would like to introduce to you! My daughter Annie and our mutual friend, Miss Karen Merlin, who is the niece of the next head of Amukam, Suzy Cloud!"

<b>

Startled by the sudden call of her name, Karen gasped.

Philip on stage was extending his hand as if to beckon her over.

<b>

Cordelia, holding Karen's hand, was looking at her with a serious expression.

Looking around, Bona and Dalton were directing soft gazes towards her while applauding.

Caroline Goldberg and Anthony Reinberger, who had arrived at some point, were also clapping nearby.

Caroline slightly tilted her head toward the stage, her eyes saying, "Go on."

<b>

And Cordelia's grip on her hand tightened.

Holding Karen's hand, Cordelia led her forward and entrusted her to Philip, who was extending his hand.

<b>

Not understanding what was happening, Karen could only widen her eyes, sandwiched between Philip and Annie on stage.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Let me introduce her again. This is Miss Karen Merlin from Munanotos!"

<b>

Still bewildered, Karen was left behind as Philip grandly waved his hand and continued speaking.

<b>

"With the approval of Lord Goldberg, I, Philip Cloud, along with Dalton Banjo, the chairman of the Miria Castle Eye Academy, and Bona Raven Casper of Boltosnan, have become her guardians!"

<b>

Amidst the applause from the guests, Karen on stage opened her eyes wide.

Indeed, when Dan and Nan were taken into the academy, Philip had mentioned that guardians would be assigned to them.

At that time, he had said, "A few of us, including myself, will become guardians."

But to think it would be Uncle Bona and, unexpectedly, the chairman!

Moreover, to have this announced in such a crowded place, she had heard nothing about it at all!!

<b>

She didn't let her mouth hang open in surprise, but she couldn't help but widen her eyes.

When she cautiously glanced at Philip, he winked lightly at her.

<b>

Ah, this person is a confirmed culprit.

<b>

"Furthermore! I would like to report here that the mining operations in Munanotos, which have been halted, are scheduled to resume next year with our support!"

<b>

The mining operations that had been stopped for years were set to restart.

She hadn’t heard anything about that.

However, the idea of the mine starting up again and bringing vitality back to Munanotos was also a wish of her parents.

<b>

Unknowingly, Karen's heart began to race.

<b>

That was something she had wished for all along.

She wanted to fulfill the wishes her father and mother could not.

That was why she had resolved to stay in that land and declined the invitation from the Casper family.

<b>

Why had she forgotten that until now?

As she was lost in thought, Annie gently placed her small hand over the one she was tightly holding.

<b>

<b>

"Such nonsense cannot be accepted!!"

<b>

A rough voice suddenly echoed through the hall.

In response to that one-sided declaration, Lawrence Niven raised his voice.

<b>

<b>

――That was the prey she had taken time to ensnare. Was he planning to snatch it away at this sudden moment?!

She had never been treated so rudely before!

Enough with the foolishness!!――

<b>

<b>

"Is there a problem with what I just said, Lord Lawrence Niven?"

<b>

Philip, glancing at Lawrence, opened his eyes as if surprised and asked what was the matter.

Feeling the blood rush to his neck from that insincere attitude, Lawrence shouted, "Of course!!"

<b>

"First of all, I am the guardian of that girl, and I have taken over the mining operations! It is not the place of unrelated individuals to interfere! This is an overreach! It is a clear takeover of the business!!"

<b>

"You claim to have taken over the business, but since the accident, no work has been done in the mine, including investigations, has it?"

<b>

"That is our business! It’s a matter of budget allocation! We plan to resume once the plans are in place! It is not your place to comment on such matters from the outside!!"

<b>

"By the way, is there even a plan document? You claim to have taken over the business, but what proof do you have? Is the contract itself legitimate?"

<b>

"What are you trying to say?! This is an agreement made by my trading company… by me! With the late Mr. Merlin! I took in his child, Miss Karen! I swore before his grave that I would raise her well! What right do you have to trample on that vow?!"

<b>

Lawrence, with a pained expression, cried out, "I swore before his grave," gathering sympathetic gazes and voices from the audience.

Seeing that, Lawrence smirked inwardly.

<b>

"The feeling of loving a child… I understand it well! I can only imagine how much you cared for your children…"

<b>

"If that's the case, then you should understand my feelings as well?! That Mr. Merlin's legacy is under my protection! Stop making baseless accusations!!"

<b>

Every time Lawrence's rough voice echoed, Karen felt distortions in her vision.

Why? Her breathing was strangely shallow.

<b>

Who was that shouting over there?

The deep wrinkles etched in his forehead and his fierce eyes appeared to her as a very terrifying expression.

Just a moment ago, he had seemed so kind, so why was that?

<b>

No, had it always been like this?

The deep wrinkles in his forehead were etched sharply, and those cold eyes always looked down on others.

She remembered the first time she had seen those eyes, instinctively hiding behind her father's body.

<b>

"What about those young twins? Shouldn't those children be protected under trustworthy guardians?"

<b>

"Of course! That's why I searched for a facility where the two could spend time close to their sister!"

<b>

<b>

"That facility was in a redevelopment area. You can't say you didn't know that?"

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

"There are hardly any residents around, and the place is filled with buildings waiting to be demolished due to aging. Moreover, those claiming to be the facility's managers are unregistered operators running a shady facility. Are you saying you were unaware of that?"

<b>

"…What? What does it matter if such a place exists! It might have been scheduled for relocation soon!"

<b>

"From that facility, a horrifying record called a shipping ledger has emerged."

<b>

"What did you say…"

<b>

"Those self-proclaimed managers were selling the children in the facility as products. That was a facility for human trafficking of orphaned children."

<b>

"Don't be ridiculous! Such lawlessness could not possibly happen in this town! You are mocking Lord Goldberg's duty to maintain the peace in this town! Do you understand?! What evidence do you have to make such absurd claims?!!"

<b>

――That place was supposed to be disposed of soon.

After dealing with all the children, everything was to be cleaned up, leaving no evidence behind.

Thanks to Fluke collapsing, all of this remained as it was――

Lawrence unknowingly clenched his jaw tightly.

<b>

"The managers of that facility profited from trafficking children. And you were the one who introduced that facility. You must have known they were intermediaries for a child trafficking organization."

<b>

"Don't say such foolishness! What evidence do you have for such claims! I could never have known such a thing! I was just introduced to that place!"

<b>

When Lawrence looked at Karen standing on stage, she was pale, staring at him with emotionless eyes, not blinking.

<b>

"Karen, please understand! I searched for that facility for your sake! I was just told it was trustworthy!"

<b>

<b>

In Karen's mind, memories were swirling chaotically in that brief moment.

<b>

What memory is this? When did that happen?

Is this my father?

Is he angry about something?

<b>

"Damn it! I can't believe I have to go along with his story!"

"…Kane."

"Walter has completely lost contact… I mean, Walter could never do such a thing! Thinking back, it was strange from the start! …Could it be that he was pulling the strings from behind from the very beginning?!"

"Kane! The children are watching. Besides… we have no proof."

"Oh, I'm sorry, Karen. It's okay, I'm not angry. Yeah, it's okay, Nan. Dad and Mom aren't going anywhere. We'll always be together. Don't worry, go back to bed, Dan. Go with Nan. Karen, I'm counting on you to take care of them."

"Karen, are you worried? But we'll be fine. Believe it or not, Dad and Mom are strong, you know? If it comes to it, Bart will surely come to help. So, okay? It'll be fine. This red stone will protect you. Please take care of the two of them, Karen. I love you."

<b>

The gentle gaze of her father and the warmth of her mother gently touching her cheek.

<b>

<b>

――――――――――

<b>

<b>

"For a while, it seems I can breathe with this."

"For now, yes. But if only it were with someone more trustworthy…"

"Right now, we can't rely on them. They are in a difficult situation themselves. I feel useless for not being able to help them."

"I understand, Kane. Bona is focused on the reconstruction of Boltosnan, so she has no spare capacity for other matters. Moreover, I've heard that there are those who are hindering the distribution of relief supplies."

"Dalton just took over the academy from your father. I've heard that there are many trying to undermine him due to vested interests. It’s not a situation where we can ask for help."

"I've sent a letter to Bart, but… I don't know where he is now, so I can't count on him."

"That's fine, we'll manage somehow! Everyone is going through tough times right now. Once we get through this, let's gather again like we used to."

"Yes, we must get through this! For these children. Hehe, it's been years since we all gathered together, hasn't it?"

<b>

Despite the difficult times, her father and mother still laughed together.

<b>

<b>

――――――――――

<b>

"That he can't come? They specified today for him to come."

"They said something urgent came up. Since we can manage the inspection ourselves, they want him to go there."

"Still as selfish as ever!"

"Calm down, Kane. The preparations for the inspection are ready, and people are waiting in the mine."

"I know, Leela. They probably sent a geologist over, right?"

"Yes, though it's questionable whether they are genuine… they are already on-site."

"That's irrelevant now, Leela. But Lawrence Niven, he is the one I cannot trust. We must keep a close watch on his movements."

"I understand, Kane. That man could employ any means necessary."

"Yes, if everyone is waiting, let's hurry, Leela. Karen, I'm off."

"Please take care of things while I'm gone, Karen. Dan, Nan, listen to your sister, okay?"

"I'll be back by evening, Karen."

"Let's have dinner together tonight. I'm off, Karen."

<b>

The warning from her father not to trust that man and the warmth of her mother’s last touch.

<b>

<b>

――――――――――

Why had she forgotten until now?

The last memory of her father and mother.

The heavy lid that had been sealed suddenly burst open, and the memories that had been trapped began to overflow.

<b>

Since just a little while ago… after the incident with that facility, she had felt the fog that had been hanging over her mind dissipating.

Day by day, her focus seemed to be sharpening little by little.

And now.

The moment she recognized that Lawrence Niven's expression was terrifying, the remaining fog completely vanished, and the memories hidden beyond it surged back all at once.

<b>

Lawrence Niven. No doubt, this man had ensnared her father and mother.

And even tried to sell Dan and Nan?

So why had she trusted this man until now?

<b>

Her body swayed for a moment. Karen instinctively placed her right hand on her head.

Noticing this, Annie hurriedly held Karen down with her whole body.

Karen quickly regained control of her body and smiled at Annie, saying, "I'm okay, thank you."

<b>

But immediately after, her gaze turned toward Lawrence Niven, who was less than five meters away from the stage.

<b>

Receiving Karen's gaze, Lawrence involuntarily gasped.

During the exchange with Philip, he had been stepping forward with each word, but when he met Karen's eyes, he could no longer move forward.

<b>

Karen's expression had changed from before. Van had not been wrong when he said the "control" had been lifted.

<b>

"Karen! Please listen! This is a misunderstanding! Everything I did was for your sake! There may have been some unfortunate misunderstandings, but please believe me! Everything is for you! I am on your side!!"

<b>

Lawrence placed his right hand over his chest as if to prove his innocence, pleading with Karen that it was all a misunderstanding.

But those empty words did not reach her.

<b>

Her eyes… Karen's eyes were simply piercing through Lawrence Niven.
