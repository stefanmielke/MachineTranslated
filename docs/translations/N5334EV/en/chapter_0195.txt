# 183 Karen's Memory

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to join us today. As of today, I, Annie Cloud, am eight years old.

<blank>

On stage, organizer Philip Cloud and his daughter, Annie Cloud, the star of the party, stand to address the guests in attendance. Annie has changed outfits for the first of several times today, and is now in a pure white fishtail dress.

<blank>

Karen and Cordelia felt a sense of pride at the sight of their little friend behaving so grandly in front of so many people.

They held hands and watched her, perhaps feeling protective toward Annie in her place now that Suzy was absent.

<blank>

Bona Raven Casper, who witnessed the slight growth of her daughter, stands beside them and looks at her daughter with her eyes narrowed lovingly.

His eyes turned to the small stone that gleamed with golden light on Cordilia's chest.

<blank>

You carry it with you, Cody.

Oh, hi, Dad! I can't wear it where you can see it on campus, but I carry it with me at all times!"

I sent that 'Terrill's Blessing' to wish you well, and I am so glad you wear it always, Cody. I'm so glad you wear it always, Cody. ...... so is that red stone of yours, Karen. Leela sent it to you wishing you well. Take good care of it."

"Your mother is ....... Yes, thank you, Little Father Bona."

I will take good care of you! Father!

<blank>

Dalton Banjo joins his friend and his two daughters in quiet steps.

On the stage, Annie's greeting was finished, and the applause of the entire audience praised the girl who took a bow with a beautiful posture.

<blank>

Dalton looked at Bona, then exchanged glances with Philip on the podium and nodded briefly to each other.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, ladies and gentlemen! I am pleased to present to you! My daughter Annie and my niece, Miss Karen Merlin, mutual friends of Suzy Cloud, the next head of AMCAM!

<blank>

Karen gasps at the sudden call of her name.

Philip, on the platform, is holding out his hand, as if to say come here.

<blank>

Cordelia, holding Karen's hand, has a serious gaze fixed on her.

Looking around, I saw Bona and Dalton giving themselves a soft look and clapping.

Caroline Goldberg and Anthony Reinberger, who I don't know when they arrived, are clapping their hands right beside me.

Caroline made a small movement of her little head toward the podium, and her eyes said, "Go on.

<blank>

And Cordelia's grip tightens.

Cordelia, who had grabbed Karen's hand, stepped in with her and left Karen in the care of Philip, who extended his hand from the podium and said, "I'll leave it to you.

<blank>

Karen, who had no idea what was going on, just kept her eyes black and white and was flanked by Philip and Annie, father and daughter, on the platform.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I am pleased to introduce to you once again. I am Miss Karen Merlin of Munanotos!"

<blank>

With the still puzzled Karen left behind, Phillip waves his hand grandly and continues to speak.

<blank>

With Lord Goldberg's approval, I, Philip Cloud, Dalton Banjo, President of the Miria Castel Eye Boarding School, and Bona Raven Casper of Boltusnan, have been appointed her guardians. I, Philip Cloud, and Mr. Dalton Banjo, Chancellor of Miria Castellai Boarding School, and Ms. Bona Raven Casper of Boltsunan, have been appointed her guardians.

<blank>

Karen's eyes widen on stage amidst the applause from the guests.

Indeed, when I took Dan and Nan into the academy, Philip told me that they would have guardianship for themselves and their siblings.

At the time, I was indeed told that "several people, including myself, were to be placed under guardianship.

But I didn't realize that it was Bona's little father and, no way, the chairman of the board!

And to be presented at such a large gathering, I didn't hear anything at all!

<blank>

I was so surprised that I didn't even open my mouth to speak, but I still couldn't help but open my eyes.

I looked fearfully at Philippe, who lightly winked at me.

<blank>

Oh, he's so sure of it.

<blank>

Furthermore! I am happy to report that the mining operations in Munanotos, which are currently halted, will resume next year with our support!

<blank>

Mining operations, which had been halted for years, restarted.

I haven't heard that story either.

However, it was the wish of the parents that the mine would come back into operation and that Munanotos would regain its vitality.

<blank>

Karen's heart throbs without her knowledge.

<blank>

It was something I had been wishing for a long time.

I want to fulfill the wish that my father and mother could not fulfill.

It is precisely because he thought so that he must have rejected the Casper family's invitation and made up his mind to remain on that land.

<blank>

Why had I forgotten about it until now?

Annie gently put her own small hand on the hand that I had been clutching.

<blank>

<blank>

I don't accept that nonsense!"

<blank>

Then a rough voice was thrown into the air, echoing throughout the hall.

The sheer one-sidedness of the declaration caused Lawrence Niven to speak up unexpectedly.

<blank>

<blank>

--It's something you've spent a lot of time on, something you've been circling. And you're suddenly going to snatch it from the side at this point in time?

I've never been treated in such a way before!

You've got to be kidding me! --

<blank>

<blank>

This is Mr. Lawrence Niven! Is there something wrong with what you just said?"

<blank>

When Lawrence raised his voice, Philip took one look at him, opened his eyes as if to say he was surprised, and asked him what was going on.

Feeling the blood rush to his neck at the blandness of his attitude, Lawrence said, "Of course! and raised his voice even higher.

<blank>

I am the guardian of the daughter, and I took over the mining business! It is not for an unrelated person to interfere! This is an overreach! This is a clear takeover of the business!

<blank>

You say you have taken over the business, but you have not done any work at the mine since the accident, including the investigation, have you?

<blank>

It's a matter of budgeting! It's a matter of budgeting! As soon as we have a plan in place, we will reopen! I don't need to be told this from the outside!

<blank>

You say, "In the first place, does a written plan exist? You say you have taken over the business, but how do you prove it? Is the contract itself legitimate?"

<blank>

What in the world is your point? This is the agreement that my Chamber of Commerce has made with ...... and myself! This is the covenant I made with the late Lord Merlin! I have also entrusted her child, Miss Cullen, to your care! I swore on my grave that I would raise her well! What right do you have to trample on that oath?

<blank>

Lawrence, with a sad look on his face, exclaimed, "I swore on my grave," drawing sympathetic glances and voices from the audience.

When Lawrence confirmed this, he chuckled inside.

<blank>

"I love my children. ....... I understand it well! I can only imagine how much of your heart you have left ...... for your children."

<blank>

If that is the case, then you can understand why I have entrusted it to you! The last remaining possessions of Mr. Merlin are now under my protection! I beg you to stop making false accusations!

<blank>

Karen felt her vision becoming distorted every time she heard Lawrence's rough voice.

Why? His breathing is awfully shallow.

<blank>

Who the hell is that yelling over there?

The deep furrow between his brows and his steely eyes somehow make him look very frightening.

Why in the world did he look so kind just a few minutes ago?

<blank>

No. Has it always been this way?

The furrows between his brows were steep and deeply furrowed, and his cold eyes always looked down on others.

I remember the first time I saw those eyes and unintentionally hid behind my father's body.

<blank>

What about the little twins? Shouldn't she be the one being sheltered in a trusted home?"

<blank>

'Of course! That's why I sought out a facility for the two of us to stay close to my sister!"

<blank>

<blank>

The area where that facility was located is a redevelopment area. Don't tell me you didn't know that."

<blank>

What?

<blank>

There are hardly any permanent residents around, only buildings that have deteriorated over the years and are waiting to be demolished. Moreover, the people who claim to be the managers of the facility are also unregistered operators of the facility. Are you saying you didn't know that?

<blank>

I'm going to go to "......" and see what's going on. What's wrong with such a place? Maybe they were planning to move soon!"

<blank>

The facility has produced a fearless record of shipments.

<blank>

"What the hell is ......?"

<blank>

The owners were selling the children as merchandise," he said. It was a facility for trafficking unaccompanied children.

<blank>

Don't be a fool! Such an outrageous thing would never happen in this city! You are mocking the work of Lord Goldberg, who is in charge of the security of this city! Do you understand? What proof do you have that you are speaking such nonsense?

<blank>

--that was the place to get rid of it in the near future.

After all the children were processed, the plan was to clean everything up and leave no evidence.

Thanks to Fluke's collapse, all of this was left intact--all of it.

Lawrence clenches his back teeth in a self-inflicted fury.

<blank>

The administrators of the facility were profiting from the trafficking of children, and you were the one who introduced them to the facility. And you were the one who introduced them. You knew, didn't you? That they were brokers for a child trafficking ring."

<blank>

Don't be ridiculous! What on earth could you possibly have to prove such a thing? How could I possibly know that? I was only referred there! I was only referred there!"

<blank>

When Lawrence looks at Karen standing on the podium, she stares at him without blinking, her face colorless, her eyes void of emotion.

<blank>

Karen, you have to understand! I looked for a facility for you guys! I was only referred there because I knew I could trust them!"

<blank>

<blank>

In this brief moment in Karen's brain, memories were dizzyingly intersecting.

<blank>

When do you remember this? When did this happen?

Is this your father?

Are you angry about something?

<blank>

I'm so glad I got him! I can't believe I'm going to have to go along with him!

'...... Kane.'

'I'm completely out of touch with Walter at ....... There is no way that Walter could have done this! It was strange from the beginning, when you think about it! He's had his hands behind his back from the beginning!

'Kane! The kids are watching. And ...... nothing is certain."

'Oh, I'm sorry Karen. It's okay, I'm not mad at you. Yeah, I'm fine, Nan. Mom and Dad aren't going anywhere. They're with us. Don't worry, Dan. You and Nan can go now. Karen, take care of them.

'Karen, I know you're worried. But we'll be fine. Your father and mother are both very strong, you know. If there is an emergency, I am sure that even Vato will come to us. So, you know? Don't worry. This red stone will protect you too. I love you.

<blank>

The soft look in your father's eyes and the warmth of your mother gently touching your cheek.

<blank>

<blank>

----------

<blank>

<blank>

It's going to keep me breathing for a while.

'Yes, barely. But at least if they were more trustworthy: ......"

I can't rely on them right now. They are in a difficult time themselves. I'm not worthy of their help.

I know, Kane. I know, Kane," he said. "Bona is so busy rebuilding Boltusnan that they can't afford to do anything about the rest of the country. In fact, I've heard reports of people who are dragging their feet in the way of aid.

Dalton has just taken over the academy from his father. I hear that there are many people who are trying to scoop up his feet. We are not in a position to ask for help right now.

I've already sent a letter to the Vaat, ......, but I don't know where she's going right now, so I can't rely on her."

We'll take care of it! We are all going through hard times right now. When we get through this, we'll all get together again like we did in the past.

'Yes, let's get through this, whatever it takes! For their sake. It's been years since we've all been together, hasn't it?

<blank>

Father and mother laughing with each other even in the midst of a difficult time.

<blank>

<blank>

----------

<blank>

<blank>

He can't come? He's the one who asked for today.

He said, 'I'm here to tell you that I have an urgent requirement. We will be sufficient for the inspection, so they want you to go there.

You are as selfish as ever!

Kane: "Calm down, Kane. We've already prepared for the inspection and there are people waiting for you at the mine.

'I know, Leela. They sent their own geologists, didn't they?"

Yes, I've already been in the area, although I doubt it's real. ......

'It's too late for that, Leela. But Lawrence Niven, he's the only one I don't trust. Let's always keep an eye on him.

I know, Kane. I know, Kane, what kind of moves that man can make.

'Mm, well, if you're keeping everyone waiting, hurry up, Leela. Karen, I'm off.

'You're going to have to stay, Karen. Dan, Nan, you listen to your sister, okay?"

I'll be back in the evening, Karen.

'Let's all have dinner together tonight. I'm off, Karen.

<blank>

Your father telling you not to trust that man alone, and your mother's body heat touching you at the end.

<blank>

<blank>

----------

<blank>

How could I have forgotten until now?

The last memory of your father and mother.

The heavy lid that had sealed it suddenly burst open, and memories of the past that had been locked away spilled out like an overflow.

<blank>

Just recently, ......, I felt the haze that had been hanging over my head since that facility thing happened was disappearing.

Each day seemed to bring a little more focus to my consciousness.

And now.

As soon as I recognized that Lawrence Niven's expression was horrifying, the remaining haze disappeared cleanly, and the memories that had been hidden behind it came back all at once.

<blank>

Lawrence Niven. No doubt, this is the person who framed your father and mother.

And even tried to sell out Dan and Nan?

So why did you trust this man until now?

<blank>

Her body seemed to wobble for a moment. Karen involuntarily put her right hand on her head.

Annie noticed this and hurriedly restrained Karen with her whole body.

Karen immediately regains control of her body and tells Annie with a small smile, "I'm fine, thank you.

<blank>

But immediately his eyes turned to Lawrence Niven, who was less than five meters away from the podium.

<blank>

Lawrence catches Karen's eyes and gasps on the spot.

He had been moving his feet forward with each word he exchanged with Philip, but when he met Karen's gaze, he was unable to move his feet any further.

<blank>

Her expression has changed from Karen's so far. Van was not wrong when he said that his 'control' had been broken.

<blank>

Karen! Listen to me! This is a misunderstanding! Everything we've done has been done with your best interests in mind! There may be a few unfortunate misunderstandings, but please believe me! It's all about you! I am on your side!

<blank>

Lawrence puts his right hand on his chest as if to prove his innocence, and pleads with Karen that it was all a misunderstanding.

But those fruitless words do not reach Karen.

<blank>

The eyes of the ...... Cullen were simply and silently shooting through Lawrence Niven.
