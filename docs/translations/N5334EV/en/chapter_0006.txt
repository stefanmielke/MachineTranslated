# 06 Suzy and the Gatekeeper

Anyone can produce 'Ki'," he said. I mean, we all use it naturally, don't we?"

I don't remember using it.

The same is true of "being attentive" and "reading the atmosphere! The same goes for 'atmosphere,' 'presence,' 'feel good, feel bad,' 'get along, get along, get along,' and as the section chief often says, 'Have a lot of spirit! And the chief of the section often says, "Have spirit!

I'm not sure if that's true when you put it that way. I guess so, but I can't quite put my finger on it.

Whether you are aware of it or not, athletes use it in their daily lives. If you are a baseball player, the ball will be heavy if you put Ki on it, and if you hit it with a bat covered with Ki, the ball will be sharp. A basketball player can absorb the ball in his palm, and when he passes or shoots, he can push it out with Ki on it. And so on.

What a sucker!"

It means you can use it that way, too. There is a pressure point here at the base of the thumb. You can inhale and exhale from here.

"What's that, Android What? What's that?"

I don't think I'm wrong about the image," he said. Also, blood flow and breathing have a lot to do with it."

Blood flow?

If the blood flow is poor, ch'i will not be able to pass through the body. If the carpal bones are not open, the chi will not come out properly. If you have a stiff body, it's no use to me.

Did he just casually disrespect me?　You're right, I'm a little stiff, but still!"

<blank>

After spending the morning by the lake and echoing the area over and over again in the refreshing early morning scenery, we packed up and left Plateau Lake, breathing heavily.

<blank>

He thought there was no end to the story.

I dare not mention what is 'endless'.

<blank>

<blank>

The day went on and went through the highlands in one fell swoop.

Soon the greenery begins to disappear and the landscape becomes more like a snowy country.

<blank>

The query item, "Coat of Yeti," equipped from the time snow began to appear around the area.

<blank>

I arrived here with only my white winter coat, which was made from Yeti fur.

<blank>

The altitude must have already exceeded 7,000 meters, but I was told that I would have no problem wearing only a coat without an oxygen mask!　I muttered to myself as I continued onward across the snow-covered white plateau.

<blank>

<blank>

We passed through a forest of ice and snow piled up like large spikes on the slopes, creating a forest of ice trees.

Eventually, after passing through the woods, we came to a slightly open area.

There is space for about two tennis courts.

<blank>

In front of it is a white wall covered with snow.

A part of the wall, which seemed to go on forever, has a large tear in it.

The path opens as if to lead visitors to the top of the mountain.

<blank>

At its entrance it was.

This is the first artifact I have seen since I arrived here.

<blank>

The gate was made of a series of wedge-shaped stones piled up on top of each other to form an arch.

<blank>

The gate is 2 meters wide and about 4 meters high.

The piled rocks on the left and right had carvings resembling pillars, and the tops of the arches had some kind of relief, but they are like wreckage with only a few traces of how long time has been chipping away at them.

<blank>

And it was there before.

The gatekeeper wrapped in a full plate of shining silver.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"...... funny, it doesn't respond to search ......?　An object?"

<blank>

Suzy decided to take a look around a bit.

<blank>

It stood majestically in front of the gate, with the huge halberd's stone pith in its right hand standing on the earth and its left hand on its hip.

<blank>

If you look closely, you can see two pairs of outstretched wing-like designs on the front of the helmet, on the breast of the armor, and on the axe of the halberd.

<blank>

(Is it a ...... set design?)

<blank>

Sole has not moved an inch.

The more you look at it, the more it seems like an object.

When I moved closer to a distance of about 10 meters to get a better look. ......

<blank>

"If you want to pass through this gate, show me your proof!"

<blank>

Suddenly, a voice rang out.

Immediately, he jumped backward about five meters.

<blank>

（What's that word?　I don't know that word?　But I know what it means.)

<blank>

I searched again, but still no mob response in the search.

<blank>

"If you want to pass through this gate, show me your proof!"

<blank>

Once again, voices echoed around the area.

<blank>

(Are you asking for a response?　Is it an automatically controlled object?　Like an ETC?)

<blank>

I... want... to... go... to... school... for... myself... and... my... friends... and family.

<blank>

(Is this how you pronounce it?　How do I know how to pronounce it?　(Oh no, I'm a dream cheat!!!!)

<blank>

I thought about that as I responded with words I had never used before.

<blank>

No one without a certificate is qualified to cross the gate!　Only those who are willing to spare their lives can pass through!　If you do not wish to live, leave quickly!

<blank>

He shouted, "I'm not a good person, I'm not a good person!

<blank>

Nu?"

<blank>

Swaying as if sensing something, Suzy instantly disappeared from the spot.

At the same time, thunder rumbles and a violent lightning storm runs through the place.

However, the purple lightning that lost its landing point ripped through the atmosphere, gouging the earth where Suzy had just been and vaporizing the snow.

The smell of ozone filled the area.

<blank>

（Thunderbolts?　They shot at us without ta-me?　......!　Geez!)

<blank>

Without relaxing, he kept his distance from the gatekeeper and turned his attention once again to the other party around him.

Then I noticed that the response to it was to Mob.

And .......

<blank>

Red?　Can't you escape?　Can't you escape?

<blank>

Mob is red.

This is the sign of a strong enemy in the game who is plus 25 or more levels higher than you.

If they meet, they will not be able to escape.

If the attack hits, the level difference is that one or two shots will kill you.

<blank>

I feel the blood drain from my entire body.

Immediately, all equipment was returned to G Zero rank.

<blank>

（I'm so stupid!　I didn't even enchant it!　I'm too stupid to go into battle unprotected!)

<blank>

Avoiding the lightning flash that runs again, he jumps back and hits a rock sticking out of the snow with his right hand, still holding his sword, and uses the momentum to roll sideways to avoid it.

<blank>

(Huh?　This guy isn't alone, is he?　(Is this a party of "helmet with no name," "armor with no name," "small hands with no name," and "halberd with no name"?)

<blank>

He put his chi into his sword as he dodged a further series of lightning strikes.

<blank>

(Kuso!　If I run away like this, will I get hit from the back?　Can you get a blow in to check him?　Can you back him up?)

<blank>

Between lightning strikes, he half-turned in mid-air while avoiding the side air, and then, upside down, he thrust out his sword and struck with his skill.

<blank>

I'm shaking!　Haaaatttt!!!!"

<blank>

≪Impact Storm≫.

Dueling Barbarian Skills.

It is a long-range ranged attack skill that releases sword chi to damage enemies at a distance and around them as well.

<blank>

A shining white sword qi flew.

<blank>

In an instant the light reaches the armor.

Instantly, a shock accompanied by a flash of light spread out in a circle.

Armor, helmets, small arms, halberds, all were swallowed by the shockwave, making a creaking, disgusting metallic sound as they were consumed by the wave of destruction.

<blank>

A roar shakes the atmosphere and a vicious blast blasts the area.

With the storm drenching the area, the remnants of what used to be armor and weapons crumpled, ripped, bent, and shattered, flying in shreds like paper shreds.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Oh, what?　Huh?　Huh?　Huh?

<blank>

Susie dropped her hands and stared at the spot where her armor had stood with a stunned expression on her face.

The snow had blown away and the ground had been gouged out, creating a large crater over 20 meters in diameter.

The center of the crater is also charred and smokes busily.

<blank>

"They were all red, weren't they?　Huh?　Why are you so stunned ......?　Was it really a ...... object?　Was it just an object that restricted traffic and shouldn't have been attacked?　Was the thunderbolt actually not that powerful?　Or that we shouldn't have destroyed it?　Or?　Or?

<blank>

I'm starting to get a nasty sweat on my back.

In my mind's eye, the image of a runaway car smashing through the ETC bar at the entrance to the highway and entering at great speed comes to mind.

<blank>

"......, can we just pretend it never happened ......?"

<blank>

Somehow, I scurried around.

<blank>

No, no, no!　There's no such thing as surveillance cameras!　And this is a dream!　It's a dream!　It's not a problem!

<blank>

They were looking for surveillance cameras.

<blank>

Hahhhhhh .......

After he shouted into the void, he put away his weapon and returned his equipment to the black A-rank.

<blank>

He lightly clenches his fist to his mouth and clears his throat lightly with a cooing sound.

<blank>

I said, "All right!　The way is open!　Let's move on!

<blank>

He seems to think he's reworked it.

<blank>

He took his white coat from his inventory again and put it on with a grand gesture.

<blank>

We went straight through the gate and ran up the road to the top of the mountain at once.

<blank>

It's as if they are fleeing the scene of the crime as quickly and as far away from the crime as possible.

Just like a hare, they leapt, ran, and ran away.
