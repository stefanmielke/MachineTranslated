# Episode 06: Suzy and the Gatekeeper

"Anyone can produce 'ki.' In fact, everyone uses it as a matter of course, you know?"

"I don't remember using it."

"'Being considerate' or 'reading the air' are examples! Things like 'atmosphere' or 'presence,' 'feeling good or bad,' 'getting along or not,' and then there's what the section chief often says, 'Have spirit!' That's also related, you know?"

"Hmm, when you put it that way, I guess it could be true? But I still don't quite get it."

"Whether you're aware of it or not, athletes use it normally. For a baseball player, if the 'ki' is on the ball, it becomes a heavy pitch, and if they hit it with a bat wrapped in 'ki,' the hit will be sharp. For a basketball player, they stick the ball to their palm and when passing or shooting, they push it out with 'ki,' for example."

"Like a suction cup!?"

"That's one way to use it. There’s a pressure point here at the base of the thumb. You can suck or release 'ki' from here."

"Sounds like some kind of android or something?"

"You're not wrong with that image. Blood flow and breathing techniques are also related."

"Blood flow?"

"If blood flow is poor, the 'ki' won't circulate well. This part of the palm won't work properly unless the carpal bones are relaxed and open. If your body is stiff, it's not going to work."

"Did you just casually diss me!? I know I'm stiff, but still!"

<b>

As dawn broke by the lakeside, after resonating voices echoed around multiple times in the refreshing scenery, I prepared myself with heavy breaths and left the highland lake.

<b>

It seemed they thought it was endless.

What was 'endless' was deliberately left unmentioned.

<b>

<b>

That day, they dashed through the highlands all at once.

Eventually, the greenery began to disappear, and the scenery started to resemble a snowy country.

<b>

When the snow began to appear around, they donned the quest item 'Yeti's Coat.'

<b>

They had come this far wearing only a white winter coat made from Yeti fur.

<b>

The altitude must have already exceeded 7,000 meters, yet without an oxygen mask, they had no issues with just this coat—what a dream quality! They murmured such things while advancing through the white highland snow.

<b>

<b>

Ice and snow piled up on the slope like large thorns, creating a forest of frost-covered trees.

Eventually, upon exiting that forest, they arrived at a slightly open area.

There was a space about the size of two tennis courts.

<b>

In front of them stood a white wall covered in snow.

There was a large gash in part of the wall that seemed to stretch endlessly.

It appeared to create a path that guided visitors as if leading them to the summit.

<b>

It was there at the entrance.

The first artificial object they had seen since arriving in this land.

<b>

On either side of the gash, stones were stacked to form an arch, with wedge-shaped stones piled on top.

<b>

The width of the gate was about 2 meters, and its height was around 4 meters.

The stacked stones on either side had carvings resembling pillars, and there seemed to be some kind of relief at the apex of the arch, but after who knows how long, it had become little more than a remnant with only faint traces remaining.

<b>

And there it stood before them.

A gatekeeper clad in shining silver full plate armor.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"...That's strange, no response to the exploration...? Is it an object?"

<b>

Suzy decided to observe for a moment.

<b>

The gatekeeper stood proudly in front of the gate, with a massive halberd's stone tip planted in the ground and their left hand resting on their hip.

<b>

Upon closer inspection, it was clear that the front of the helmet, the chest of the armor, and the axe part of the halberd were adorned with designs resembling two pairs of outspread wings.

<b>

(...Is it a set design?)

<b>

It didn't move an inch.

The more they looked, the more it seemed like an object.

As they approached within about 10 meters for a better look...

<b>

"If you wish to pass through this gate, show me proof!"

<b>

Suddenly, a voice echoed.

They instinctively jumped back about 5 meters.

<b>

(Huh? An unfamiliar language? But I understand the meaning??)

<b>

They searched again, but still, there was no mob reaction to the exploration.

<b>

"If you wish to pass through this gate, show me proof!"

<b>

The voice echoed once more.

<b>

(Are they asking for a response? Is it an automatically controlled object? Like an ETC system?)

<b>

"I... seek... passage...!"

<b>

(Is this pronunciation okay? And why do I understand the language?! This is crazy, dream cheat!!)

<b>

While responding with words they had never used before, they thought such things.

<b>

"Those without proof have no right to pass the gate! Only those who do not value their lives may pass! If you hesitate, quickly depart!!"

<b>

With that shout, the gatekeeper readied the halberd and pointed its spear tip at Suzy.

<b>

"Huh?"

<b>

As if sensing something, the gatekeeper swayed slightly, and Suzy instantly vanished from that spot.

At the same time, a thunderclap roared, and a fierce lightning bolt raced through the area.

However, the purple lightning, having lost its target, tore through the air and gouged the ground where Suzy had just been, evaporating the snow.

The smell of ozone filled the air.

<b>

(Thunderstrike? Did it fire without charging? ...Ugh! What the heck?!)

<b>

Without relaxing their guard, they maintained their distance from the gatekeeper and focused their awareness on the surroundings.

Then... 

<b>

"Bright red, huh!? Oh no!! Can I escape this?!"

<b>

The mob was red.

In gaming terms, this indicated a strong enemy with a level 25 or more above theirs.

If they encountered it, escape was unlikely.

If attacked, the level difference meant they could die in 1 or 2 hits.

<b>

They felt the blood drain from their face.

Instinctively, they returned all their equipment to G Zero rank.

<b>

(Oh no, I'm such an idiot! I didn't enchant anything!! Charging into battle unprepared is beyond foolish!!!)

<b>

Dodging the lightning once more, they punched a rock protruding from the snow with their right hand still holding the sword, using the momentum to perform a somersault to evade.

<b>

(Huh? This isn't just a single entity? 'Nameless Helmet,' 'Nameless Armor,' 'Nameless Gauntlet,' 'Nameless Halberd'—are they a party?!)

<b>

While dodging the successive lightning strikes, they focused their energy into the sword.

<b>

(Damn it! If I just run away, I'll get hit from behind?! Can I land a hit to keep them at bay? Can I back off like that?!)

<b>

In the gaps between the lightning strikes, they performed a sideways somersault, half-rotating in mid-air, thrusting the sword downward with skill.

<b>

"Feel the tremors! Haaaaart!!!"

<b>

≪Impact Storm≫

A skill of the Duel Barbarian.

A ranged area attack skill that releases sword energy to damage distant enemies and those around them.

<b>

The white shining sword energy flew forth.

<b>

In an instant, the light reached the armor.

At that moment, a shockwave accompanied by a flash of light spread out in a circular shape.

The armor, helmet, gauntlet, and halberd were all engulfed by the shockwave, emitting a disturbing metallic sound as they were consumed by the wave of destruction.

<b>

A deafening sound shook the atmosphere, and a fierce blast of wind swept through the area.

With the raging wind, the remnants of what had been armor and weapons were crushed, torn, bent, and shattered, scattering like paper scraps.

<b>

<b>

"...Huh? Wait, what? What? What the heck??"

<b>

Suzy lowered both hands, staring in shock at the spot where the armor had stood.

The snow had been blown away, and the ground had been deeply gouged, creating a large crater over 20 meters in diameter.

The center of the crater was charred and emitting smoke.

<b>

"Those guys were bright red, right? Huh? Why was that so anticlimactic...? Really... were they just objects? Something that only restricts passage, and I wasn't supposed to attack? Was that lightning strike not that powerful? Was I not supposed to destroy them? Or something?!"

<b>

They began to feel an unpleasant sweat on their back.

An image of a runaway car crashing through the ETC barrier at a highway entrance flashed in their mind.

<b>

"...Is there any way to pretend this didn't happen...?"

<b>

They looked around somewhat nervously.

<b>

"No, no, no! There can't be surveillance cameras! And besides, this is a dream! Yes, it's a dream!! There's no problem!!!"

<b>

It seemed they were looking for surveillance cameras.

<b>

Sighing deeply... 

They let out a weak voice into the void, then sheathed their weapon and returned their gear to black A rank.

<b>

They lightly brought a clenched fist to their mouth and cleared their throat.

<b>

"Alright! The path is open! Let's move on!!"

<b>

It seemed they were trying to reset their mindset.

<b>

They took out the white coat from their inventory once more and dramatically draped it over themselves.

<b>

Then, they passed through the gate and dashed up the path to the summit.

<b>

Like someone trying to escape from a crime scene as quickly and as far as possible.

Truly like a fleeing rabbit, they jumped, dashed, and ran away... and ran off.
