# 161 - Episode 161 - Measurements and Rank Up

Located in the middle of Alfalfa Street, "Cute Flint" is famous for being the most exclusive boutique in Dekenber.

His wife, Mrs. Anna Barbara, is a very talented designer and has designed most of the items in the store.

<blank>

When I asked her why the name of the boutique was "flint," she smiled and even winked at me, saying, "When you wear a nice, pretty outfit, that alone lights a fire in the hearts of the ladies.

<blank>

The store was a very cute creation.

The dazzling white exterior walls and rounded orange tiled roof.

The arched upper windows were covered with dome-like rounded eaves like a hat, which looked very nice against the white exterior walls with its bright carmine.

The large white entrance door is fitted with a brass doorknob inlaid like a bouquet of flowers.

I am sure that the owner's hobbies are being utilized in its entirety.

<blank>

As soon as the entrance door was opened and I was invited inside by Mrs. Kato, a sister flew in from the back of the store.

Oh! Miss! We have been waiting for you! Thanks to you, I am without a scratch on my body! Thank you for your help, saint!"

I am not a saint! I'm not a saint, sir!

<blank>

She held my hand with moistened eyes and shook it vigorously up and down.

This person seems to be Judy, whom Mrs.

When I explained to Judy that I was not a saint, she said, "Yes! I know! I know! I understand! She would not take it any more. I told her that I am not a theology student!

<blank>

Judy is the store's top tailor, and her skills are the best in the country, according to Mrs. Kosaka.

The couple told us along the way that he is well-liked by the children in the store and is a talented and dependable person.

<blank>

Judy! I know you want to say thank you. But time is limited!"

<blank>

Mrs. Anna clapped her hands with a clap, her well-defined voice echoing through the restaurant.

<blank>

Then Judy said, "Yes, I did! and then she quickly moves away from me.

Apparently, they had decided from the beginning to have our measurements taken by the end of the day.

Muhu ....... Was there another layer of implication in the tangerine eyes at that moment? After all this time, I realized the meaning of Colin's smile. It means that he had been planning to do this from the beginning.

<blank>

<blank>

Judy immediately ordered us to go, and we were immediately surrounded by the staff ladies.

They were taken directly to the back of the store, where they were suddenly stripped of their uniforms and started taking their measurements.

<blank>

Both Karen and I were very upset when our clothes were suddenly ripped off.

If they were to measure my inseam, etc., I would make strange noises on the spur of the moment.

<blank>

Bibi and Mia, however, were unfazed.

Mia, in particular, has such an imposing appearance. ......

There was even a sister who let out a gasp of admiration at the sheer imposingness of the product. Gnnnnnnn .......

<blank>

I was still too embarrassed to take my measurements, but they were taken soon after. I asked Mrs. Anna, "I will ask you again when the fabric arrives," she whispered to me.

So I say she is not a saint!

<blank>

I thought it went surprisingly quickly, but that didn't seem to be the case with Karen. She was being attached by her sisters, who were saying things like, "You said you liked red, so let's use a brighter scarlet," or, "Drape a little more around the waist," or, "Hold the ribbon here."

A lot of cloth was brought in, and from one end to the other, it was addressed to the body and kneaded together considerably.

<blank>

Under his wife's supervision, Karen takes the measurements and even completes the fitting at the same time.

Karen's eyeballs are already in a whirlpool pattern in the center of the flurry of activity, which is like a war zone.

At the end, I saw Karen's soul spilling out of her mouth!

<blank>

We asked Mrs. Karen to take care of Karen for a while, and we left the "lovely flint".

<blank>

We had other plans for today.

It is not that there is a shift in the "big vestibule" as usual.

The store is taking us and Karen off shift for a little while.

<blank>

Karen until the mess settles down.

We have been upgraded to a higher rank in the Adventurers' Guild, so until that process is completed, we will not be able to go to the Adventurers' Guild again.

<blank>

Yes, that means that today I was going to go to the Adventurers' Guild to go through the procedures for upgrading my rank.

<blank>

I'm sure Karen and the rest of us will be back at the store when things settle down.

<blank>

Karen was pulling back her hair as she pleaded with us not to leave her behind, but Bibi and Mia dragged us to the Adventurers' Guild, telling us to trust Barbara and her husband.

Congratulations on moving up in the ranks, ladies and gentlemen."

Thank you very much. Mr. Kuwuemel."

<blank>

Cu Emel greeted us at the Adventurers' Union counter.

<blank>

For those of you who have moved up to the "D" rank, you will now be able to work in a specialized department according to your aptitude and skills. Would you like an explanation?

I beg of you." Some of us haven't figured it out yet!"

"Thank you."

<blank>

After Bibi turned to me, I asked Cu Emel to explain.

I certainly don't understand.

Does that mean Bibi knew what he was doing? I don't understand what's going on. Hmmm.

<blank>

First of all, we at Northmilia Adventurers Association have a number of specialized departments that we use to take on jobs. This is to take advantage of the expertise of our members.

<blank>

Cu Emel explained that the specialized department is for people who specialize in technology, knowledge, and skills.

For example, cooking technology. For example, magic technology. For example, calculation technology. For example, dispensing technology.

They have specialized department contacts so that people with specialized skills can work in those areas.

<blank>

We ask that everyone at AMCAM belong here."

<blank>

The specialized department indicated by Mr. Cu Emel was called "bouncer.
