# Chapter 161: Measurements and Rank Up

Located in the middle of Alfalfa Street, "Cute Flint" is famous as the most luxurious boutique in Dekkenbel.

Madam Anna Barbara, the owner, is said to be an excellent designer, handling most of the designs for the store's items.

<b>

When I asked the lady why the boutique was named "Flint," she winked at me with a wonderful smile and said, "When you wear a lovely and cute outfit, it lights a fire in a gentleman's heart."

<b>

I see, the store was very charmingly designed.

With dazzlingly bright white outer walls and a rounded orange tiled roof.

The arched windows on top had dome-like round awnings that sat like hats, vividly contrasting against the white outer walls in a bright carmine.

The large white entrance door was fitted with a brass doorknob intricately crafted like a bouquet of flowers.

Surely, the owner's taste is fully reflected in it.

<b>

As the entrance door was opened, I was invited inside by the lady, and immediately, a young woman flew in from the back of the store.

"Oh! Young lady! We have been waiting for you! Thanks to you, I am in perfect condition! I thank the saint for her power!!"

"W-wait! I am not a saint!?"

<b>

With tears in her eyes, the young woman grabbed my hand and shook it vigorously up and down.

This must be Judy, the person the lady mentioned.

Even when I explained that I was "not a saint," Judy kept repeating, "Yes! Yes! I understand! I understand!!" without acknowledging my words. I keep telling you I'm not a theology student!

<b>

Judy is the top tailor at the store, and the lady said her skills are the best in the country.

The staff also hold her in high regard, and the couple told me she is a reliable and excellent talent.

<b>

"Judy! I understand you want to express your gratitude. However, time is limited!"

<b>

Madam Anna clapped her hands, her clear voice echoing through the store.

<b>

Then Judy said, "That's right!" and quickly stepped away from me.

It seems that it had already been decided from the beginning to take our measurements today.

Hmm... There was more to that mikan-eyed look back then. I realized the meaning of Colin's smile. They had planned this from the start.

<b>

<b>

And immediately under Judy's command, we were surrounded by the staff.

We were taken to the back of the store, and suddenly our uniforms were stripped off, and the measurements began.

<b>

In the sudden turn of events where our clothes were being taken off, both Karen and I were quite flustered.

If they measured my inseam, I might let out a strange sound in surprise.

<b>

However, Bibi and Mia remained calm.

Especially Mia, who stood there with an air of confidence that was almost overwhelming...

There was even a staff member who let out a sigh of admiration at her composure. Guh...

<b>

Even so, before I could feel embarrassed, the measurements were quickly finished. "Once the fabric for the saint arrives, I will ask you again," Madam Anna whispered to me.

So I keep saying I'm not a saint!

<b>

I thought it ended surprisingly quickly, but it seemed that wasn't the case for Karen. "Since you said you like red, let's use a brighter scarlet," "Let's add a bit more drape around the waist," "Hold the ribbon here," and so on, she was being fussed over by the staff.

A lot of fabric was brought in, and they were draping it all over her, thoroughly manipulating it.

<b>

Under the supervision of the lady, Karen was not only being measured but also had her fitting done at the same time.

In the center of the bustling chaos that felt like a battlefield, Karen's eyes were already swirling in a dizzying pattern.

At the end, I definitely saw Karen's soul escaping from her mouth!!

<b>

Since it would take a while longer, we left Karen in the lady's care and decided to leave "Cute Flint."

<b>

We had other plans for today, after all.

It wasn't like we had a shift at the "Large Front Yard" as usual.

Right now, the store had taken both Karen and us off the schedule for a little while.

<b>

Karen until the commotion settles down.

Us because our adventurer guild rank had gone up, and we needed to complete the paperwork for that.

<b>

So, in other words, we were planning to go to the adventurer guild today to process our rank up.

<b>

Once things settle down, I think both Karen and we will be back at the store.

<b>

While being pulled away by Bibi and Mia, who urged me to "Trust the Barbara couple," I was torn by Karen's pleading eyes saying "Don't leave me behind," and we headed towards the adventurer guild.

<b>

<b>

"Congratulations on your rank up, everyone."

"Thank you very much, Kuu Emel."

<b>

At the adventurer guild's counter, Kuu Emel welcomed us.

<b>

"Those who have moved up to 'D Rank' as general members will now be able to work in specialized departments according to their aptitudes and skills. Would you like an explanation?"

"Yes, please! There are still some who don't understand!"

"I understand."

<b>

After Bibi looked at me, she asked Kuu Emel for an explanation.

Hmm, I certainly don't understand.

Did Bibi understand? I'm feeling a bit unsettled about that. Hmm...

<b>

"First, at the Northmilia Adventurer Guild, we have established several specialized departments for receiving work. This is to make use of the expertise of our members."

<b>

According to Kuu Emel's explanation, the specialized departments are for those who excel in skills, knowledge, and techniques.

For example, cooking skills. For example, magical skills. For example, calculation skills. For example, potion-making skills.

There are windows for specialized departments so that those with each of these skills can work in those areas.

<b>

"We would like to ask the Amukam members to join this department."

<b>

The specialized department that Kuu Emel pointed to was called "Bodyguard."
