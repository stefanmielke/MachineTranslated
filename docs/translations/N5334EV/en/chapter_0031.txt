# 31 The Disaster of William Cloud

Susie, let me reintroduce you. William Cloud, Howard's brother, Philip's son. He's our nephew.

I'm 17 now. You just recently became a senior in high school. I used to come here every summer for the vacations, but this year, circumstances have forced me to come this late in the year, right?"

<blank>

'Yes, Aunt. Once again, I am William, your nephew. Call me Will. Nice to meet you Susie."

I'm Suzy. Nice to meet you, please. Will."

<blank>

I was actually short-staffed during the summer in the Royal Order of the Knights. I was there to make up for it under the guise of training and testing. I was there the other day for a while, and I was able to come here today after taking a late summer vacation.

Well, thank you very much.

<blank>

Susie observes William carefully as she says a few words of exertion.

He is a tall, muscular, fearless young man.

His blue-gray eyes and youthful ashy sandy blonde hair that falls over his eyes remind me of Howard in his younger days.

<blank>

(I wonder if Mr. Howard looked like this when he was young? (I wonder if Mr. Howard looked like this when he was young?)

<blank>

Suzy is enjoying herself, looking at William's face and imagining Howard in his heady days.

<blank>

What's wrong? Is... something wrong?

<blank>

William asks uncomfortably of Suzy, who is staring at him with a happy grin on her face.

<blank>

No, I'm sorry, it's nothing."

<blank>

Suzy then approached Sonia and put it in her ear....

<blank>

（Will, is he like Mr. Howard when he was younger?)

（Yes, the eyes and the bridge of the nose look exactly alike.)

(I knew it? Was he cool?)

(Hmmm, that was good. Hmmm.)

<blank>

Cackling and Suzy is all over Sonia, and Sonia is laughing happily.

<blank>

<blank>

Earlier, when Sonia was brought downstairs from Susie's room on the second floor, Howard carried her upstairs in his arms.

It is what is called a princess hug.

<blank>

Suzy saw it up close and personal, and the tension remains high.

<blank>

<blank>

While the women were happily enjoying themselves, the two men had no choice but to stand there with puzzled looks on their faces.

<blank>

Good for you, Uncle."

'Um, thanks Will. I'm sorry to have bothered you."

No, but I could see how happy they were. I haven't seen your aunt's face smiling so happily for the first time in a long time. How long has it been since I have seen your aunt's face smiling with such happiness?

Oh, yes. Susie is now an indispensable part of us. Do you understand? Will.

...... Yes." Uncle."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, by the way, I heard Will came to the Cloud house yesterday!"

<blank>

Beatrice came over to speak to Algernon, who was on her shoulder, giving him a piece of cookie.

<blank>

I came home yesterday and there he was. Bibi, you know me well, don't you?"

<blank>

Susie also replies as she reaches for the dried fruit cookies spread out after the meal.

The sweetness of dried strawberries spreads happiness.

<blank>

He said, "Your father told me that you would be at school today and that I should say hello to you when I see you! He's supposed to be at school today, and he wants me to say hello to him when I see him!"

"Yeah, I'm going to be here for a week, and Will said he's going to be in the training grounds during that time."

<blank>

I didn't hear you! I didn't hear that! I didn't hear that at all, not at all!"

<blank>

Suddenly, Colin came at Suzy as if to question her, slipping off his glasses.

<blank>

<blank>

What? Why? Why Colin?"

Oh...no, no, it's nothing, it's nothing Sue, never mind, I'm sorry."

<blank>

As Colin neatly walks away, fixing his misaligned glasses, Suzy's head is filled with question marks.

I look around, but they all quickly look away.

Susie tilts her head even more.　Maybe we should go see what's out there today...hmmm...Beatrice and Mia are whispering...what? I don't know!

<blank>

For some reason, Colin is grumpy and silently chomping on a cookie.

<blank>

Dana came up to me with a sideways glance at Colin, grinning for some reason....

<blank>

Hey?" Sue. How was Will?"

What? How...?"

What do you mean, hmm? ...hinsho? ...Hola! Like the atmosphere? Like looks? ...You know, as a man? And?

<blank>

Colin's shoulders go up! and Colin's shoulders go up.

<blank>

Atmosphere? The look? Well, you know, you look like Howard when he was young and cool. As a man? ... Physically, he's solid and dependable. Isn't he nice? I guess.

I'm a little stuck on the questioning, but... well, in general, did Sue like Will? Like him, okay?"

<blank>

Dana asks with a really fresh smile.

<blank>

Hmm? Yeah. I like Will, okay?"

I'm not kidding! Sue, did you have a crush on Will?

<blank>

Mia suddenly became colorful and crowded in.

<blank>

"Ew? And a crush? Why? There's no such thing! There is no such thing! Mia, Mia! Face! It's close! Close!

<blank>

(Why do you say "crush..."? I don't think so.... It's true that once before I got a crush on a close-up of Victor, but that was a unique case.... I mean, he's a teenage boy, right? A child? No way. There's no way I could have a crush on him.... ...But more importantly, Mia! Your face! Your face is too close! You're breathing on me!)

<blank>

When I denied it with a blush on my face, Mia looked a little skeptical and sat back down.　Mia looked a little skeptical and sat back down.

For some reason, Colin is also looking restless on the other side of the room.

<blank>

Dana and Beatrice are whispering to each other, smirking and whispering about something.

<blank>

I'll be right back! Sue? Where is Will going to sleep for a week!"

<blank>

Beatrice asked.

<blank>

Hmm? The guest room, right? The upstairs guest room?"

<blank>

I felt Beatrice's eyebrows twitch up.

<blank>

"Oh, no? Isn't Sue's bedroom upstairs too?

"Yes, you are. The guest room is in front of my room, right?"

<blank>

Suu, Suu-chan! I don't think you can be serious!

<blank>

Mia crowded into Suzy again and gripped both of her shoulders gingerly.

<blank>

I made a mistake! I'm not going to do something like that! I... don't... make... any... mistakes, okay?"

"Mistake? A what?"

Yes, together! ...... in your room! Hey, you want to... sleep?

In the same room together? Why?"

<blank>

Mia's exuberant excitement again causes Suzy to put a question mark around her head.

For some reason, Colin also shifts his glasses and comes leaning in, eyes wide open.

<blank>

"Yes, yes, it's good, it's good, it's good. Then it's okay.

<blank>

Deciding that nothing seemed to be wrong for the moment and that Susie was not even conscious, Mia moved away from Susie and sat down again.

Colin, too, pushed up his misaligned glasses with his fingers and adjusted his appearance.

However, the expression on his face says that his consciousness is not here.

<blank>

Dana and Beatrice can't stop giggling at Colin.　I mean, it's not so pathetic any more, is it?　Oh, I don't know. But today's training session is going to be interesting! This is not the time to be running!　and for some reason, they whisper to each other as if trying to hold back their laughter.

Lunch time was filled with an air of mystery.

Suzy could only tilt her head.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Hi, Susie. I'm here.

"Good day, Will. Nice to see you today.

<blank>

When Suzy and the others entered the training hall, they were greeted by William, who had already come and done his upkeep.

<blank>

Hey! Will! Long time no see! Looks like you're up to speed again, huh? I'm looking forward to it."

Dana, it's been a long time. You seem to be getting better. Take it easy on me."

<blank>

Hi Will! It's been a while! Your father sends his regards!"

It has been a long time, Beatrice. I will visit your father tomorrow. Please give him my best regards."

<blank>

"Good day Will ... it's been a while."

It's been a while, Mia. Um... what's wrong?"

<blank>

Mia greeted William, holding Susie from behind as if she was holding something precious, but when William asked her, she turned her head to the side and looked away!　She turned her head to the side and looked away.

<blank>

William asked Susie in a whisper if she had done something to offend Mia, but she only tilted her head and laughed in annoyance.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sure the kids from the magic group are here today, too, right? Are they here to observe?"

<blank>

I asked as I looked around at the other children, taking my eyes off Mia to get away from the topic.

<blank>

We heard you were coming today, so we all came to say hello."

<blank>

Colin announced from the last row of girls.

<blank>

I was going to surprise you by coming out of nowhere, but...alas! I guess it was obvious. Long time no see! Colin! I missed you so much."

It's been a while, Will. It's okay, I was surprised. Yeah, yeah! I was surprised enough! I can't believe you didn't tell me about this until just now... it really, really surprised me!

<blank>

Huh? That's weird, what's wrong with Colin?

William could not see the expression on Colin's face because his glasses were reflecting the light.

The occasional peeking eye sitting up.

He sensed that the atmosphere rising from the body contained a very swarthy spirit.

<blank>

"Uhhhhh... Colin? Is something wrong? Is something wrong?

<blank>

William asked Colin fearfully.

<blank>

What's wrong? Something wrong? Is that what you say when you see me? Is that the first thing you say when you see me?"

<blank>

Oh, this is a bad one!

<blank>

William realized with a gut feeling that comes from instinct.

<blank>

Wait a minute, Colin. I think there's been a slight misunderstanding."

Wait? Wait what? Misunderstanding? Misunderstand what? I don't know what you mean!"

<blank>

William, a large man, and Colin, a small man by nature.

The height difference is 20 centimeters. Even though Colin was looking up at him from below, William could not help but feel intimidated.

He had a single bead of sweat on his cheek.

<blank>

I'm sorry if I did something to offend you. I'm sorry if I did something to offend you. I'm sorry.

What's wrong? Did you do something for which you owe me an apology? Are you even aware of that?

Uh...er......... and..."

<blank>

William frantically turns his head.

<blank>

(What? What's Colin so mad about? What did I say? What did you do? What did Colin say? Think ......! Remember! (............)

<blank>

I'm sorry, I didn't get back to you immediately! I'm sorry!

<blank>

William vigorously turned at right angles to Colin and bowed his head. With a glimpse of Colin's face ...

<blank>

(A, Atari? Hazard or ......?)

<blank>

I'm sure you've forgotten about me anyway! ...you forgot about me anyway, didn't you ......?"

I don't think so! That's not true! I was actually going to go say hello to the Saunders family once before dinner! But, well, we got a little chatty ...... and..."

<blank>

I was so engrossed in the story... I know ...... that Sue is a lovely thing, isn't she? She's so beautiful... it's no wonder that gentlemen who meet her for the first time are so fascinated with her. ......

No, no! No, no! That's not what I meant. ......"

<blank>

I don't have to! You'd have grown a nose for Sue anyway and forgotten about me, wouldn't you!

I'm not extending it! You know you're the only one I'm into! I'm not extending my nose to anyone but you! I would never stretch it!

What?

<blank>

The girls cheer.

Colin's face turns red as he watches.

<blank>

I don't think you're stretching it or not...not at all! Don't talk like that! And...and...and...and...and that kind of thing! That's not something you say in public!

<blank>

Colin turns red and teary-eyed as if he were boiling.

<blank>

"Oh... sorry..."

Oh, my God! Will's an idiot! I don't know you anymore!!!!"

<blank>

<blank>

Colin runs away from the training hall like a hare.

<blank>

'Corin, Corin! Wait a minute! We haven't talked..."

<blank>

William reached out to follow, but his hand dropped without effort.

<blank>

What are you doing? Will! This is the part where you chase after them! If you don't catch up soon, you're going to be in even more trouble!"

<blank>

Beatrice's words made William gasp! William gulps.

<blank>

Colin, wait! Colin!!!!!!!"

<blank>

William, too, is flying out of the training hall like an arrow, catching up to Colin and holding him back.

<blank>

<blank>

Those left inside peek out the windows and watch with baited breath as the events unfold.

<blank>

Colin and William are facing each other and arguing about something, but I can't hear them because they are outside.　I hear bits and pieces of "you, me, me, you," but I can't make them out.

<blank>

Eventually Colin covered his face with his hands and turned over and his shoulders began to shake.

William gently hugged Colin in an enveloping manner.

Colin's arm is also put around William's back, and the two embrace.

A sigh escaped from the girls who were watching.　That's a kiss," I thought I heard Dana's voice!　I thought I heard Dana's voice, but I didn't care.

For the time being, it seems that the matter has been settled.

<blank>

I didn't think it would be this exciting. I didn't think it would be this exciting.

I agree! If Will had been a slacker, it would have been out of control! In that sense, it was very tense!

Well, now that I've seen something interesting! I'm going for another run! I think I'm getting somewhere!"

<blank>

'You... you guys... you've been egging Colin on? What if Will is a slacker? ...That's bad taste. ......"

<blank>

Irving looks at Dana and Beatrice alternately and says in disgust.

<blank>

"Hmmm, is that what Irving would call it? You call him a slacker? ...He's in the habit of stretching his nose too! Blah...blah...blah...blah!

I'm going to go for a run! See ya! Dana! Wait for me!

<blank>

"You ran away again, Irving."

He got away, you see.

Hmph!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After Suzy had completed her training with the children, Dana and Irving returned from their run, and were taking a break when William and Colin came back to the training hall.

<blank>

Where had the two of us disappeared to for an hour!

The mystery only deepens, but no one says anything.

Suzy was impressed by the fact that they are all children... but they are all adults.

<blank>

We apologize for any inconvenience.

It's really not funny."

<blank>

Colin and William came together to bow their heads.

They really work well together.　A lovey-dovey couple, huh?　Suzy pokes her head in.

<blank>

Colin and Will were dating, weren't they?"

"Uh-huh, well, that's what I mean..."

<blank>

William scratched his cheek as he turned his head to the side in embarrassment.

<blank>

But it's terrible! Dana and Bibi are always saying things that make me nervous!"

Well, well, well, it seems to have strengthened our bond! I'm sure we'll get along just fine! Right?"

<blank>

Dana wipes her sweat off with a towel she received from Helena and tells her with a fresh smile and no ill will.

<blank>

I'm so glad to see you! I can even hold hands in public like that now!"

<blank>

Beatrice pointed out the problem, and the two of them suddenly came to their senses.

<blank>

"Sneak, lover, connect!"

<blank>

Colin blushed even more at Suzy's tut-tutting....

<blank>

Oh, God! Remember! Both of you!

<blank>

and breathed in Dana and Beatrice.
