# Chapter 31: The Misfortunes of William Cloud

"Suzy, let me introduce you again. This is William Cloud, the son of Philip, Howard's younger brother. Our nephew.

He's 17 years old now. He just became a junior in high school recently. Normally, he would come to visit us during the long summer vacation every year, but... this year, due to circumstances, he was only able to come at this time, right?"

<b>

"Yes, Aunt. I am William, your nephew. Please call me Will. Nice to meet you, Suzy."

"It's Suzy. Nice to meet you. Will."

<b>

"Actually, during the summer, there was a shortage of manpower in the knight order of the royal capital. I participated under the pretext of training and exams. It has finally settled down, and I was able to take a late summer vacation to come here today."

"Thank you for your hard work."

<b>

Suzy carefully observes William while offering words of encouragement.

He is a tall, muscular, and handsome young man.

His grayish-blue eyes and youthful sandy blonde hair with a strong grayish tint remind one of Howard in his younger days.

<b>

(I wonder if Mr. Howard looked like this when he was young? His well-defined nose resembles Mr. Howard's and is quite handsome♪)

<b>

While looking at William's face, Suzy imagines a spirited young Howard and finds herself enjoying the thought.

<b>

"W-what's wrong? Did something... happen?"

<b>

William asks uneasily as Suzy gazes at him with a happy grin.

<b>

"No, I'm sorry, it's nothing."

<b>

Saying this, Suzy approaches Sonia and whispers in her ear...

<b>

(Does Will resemble Mr. Howard when he was young?)

(Yes, his eyes and nose are just like his.)

(Really?! Was he handsome?)

(Hehe, yes, he was.)

<b>

Squealing with delight, Suzy clings to Sonia, who is laughing happily.

<b>

<b>

Earlier, when bringing Sonia down from Suzy's room on the second floor,

Howard had carried her down in a classic princess carry.

<b>

Suzy, having seen that up close, is still excited.

<b>

<b>

While the women are having fun, the two men can only stand there with puzzled expressions.

<b>

"Uncle, I'm glad for you."

"Yeah, thanks, Will. You've been considerate."

"No, but I can see that both of you look so happy. It's been a while since I've seen Aunt with such a joyful smile."

"Ah, that's right. Suzy is now an indispensable part of us. Do you understand, Will?"

"...... Yes, Uncle."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"By the way, I heard that Will came to the Cloud family yesterday?!"

<b>

Beatrice said while giving a piece of cookie to Algernon on her shoulder.

<b>

"Yeah, when I got home yesterday, he was there. Vivi knows him well, right?"

<b>

Suzy replied while reaching for the dried fruit cookies spread out after the meal.

The sweetness of the dried strawberries spreads happiness.

<b>

"My father told me! He should be coming to school today, so make sure to greet him properly when you see him!"

"Yeah, he said he would be here for a week and that he would stop by the training grounds during that time."

<b>

"W-what?! I didn't hear anything about that! Not at all, not even a little!"

<b>

Suddenly, Colin, adjusting his glasses, pressed Suzy with a questioning look.

<b>

<b>

"Huh? Why? What's wrong, Colin?"

"Oh... no, it's nothing, nothing at all, Su, don't worry about it, sorry."

<b>

As Colin adjusts his misaligned glasses and steps back demurely, Suzy is left with a question mark floating around her head.

Looking around, everyone quickly averts their gaze.

Suzy tilts her head further. I wonder if I should go check over there? Yes, yes, Beatrice and Mia are whispering to each other... What? I don't understand!

<b>

Colin, for some reason, is silently nibbling on cookies with a displeased expression.

<b>

While glancing at Colin, Dana approaches with a grin for some reason...

<b>

"Hey, Su. How was Will?"

"What? ... How was... what?"

"How was he, hmm. Impressions? ... You know! The vibe? The looks? ... As a man?!"

<b>

Colin's shoulders jerk up slightly.

<b>

"Vibe? Looks? Well, he looks like a young Mr. Howard, and he's handsome. As a man? ... His physique is solid and reliable? Isn't he wonderful?"

"There's something about your question that feels off, but... well, generally, you liked Will? Is it safe to say you have a crush on him?"

<b>

Dana asks with a refreshingly bright smile.

<b>

"Huh? Yeah. I like Will."

"What?! No way! Su-chan, have you developed a crush on Will?!!"

<b>

Mia suddenly gets excited and closes in on her.

<b>

"Huh? A crush? W-why?! There's nothing like that! N-no! Mia! Your face! It's too close! Too close!!"

<b>

(A crush... why on earth?! There's no way! Sure, I felt my heart race once when I saw Victor up close, but that was a special case... Thinking normally, he's just a teenage boy, right? A kid! There's no way! A crush is impossible... More importantly, Mia! Your face! It's too close!! I can feel your breath!)

<b>

As she denies it with a flushed face, Mia, still a bit skeptical, pulls back and sits down again.

For some reason, Colin also seems unsettled over there.

<b>

Dana and Beatrice are whispering to each other with grins.

<b>

"Hey! Su? Where is Will going to stay for a week?!"

<b>

Beatrice asks.

<b>

"Huh? The guest room, right? It's on the second floor, though?"

<b>

Beatrice's eyebrows seem to twitch slightly.

<b>

"Oh? Isn't Su's bedroom also on the second floor?!"

"Yeah, that's right? The guest room is right in front of my room, you know?"

<b>

"S-Su-chan! I-I don't mean to imply anything, but!!"

<b>

Mia again approaches Suzy, gripping her shoulders tightly.

<b>

"Y-You’re not going to… do anything… u-unseemly… r-right?"

"Unseemly? What do you mean?"

"L-Like… sharing… the same r-room… and s-sleeping… t-together?"

"Sharing the same room? Why?"

<b>

Suzy, puzzled by Mia's excitement, has question marks floating around her head again.

For some reason, Colin also adjusts his glasses and leans forward with wide eyes.

<b>

"Y-yeah, that's fine, it's fine. If that's the case, it's all good."

<b>

Since it seems like nothing is going to happen, Mia, thinking that Suzy is not aware of it, steps back and sits down again.

Colin also pushes his misaligned glasses back up and straightens his posture.

However, his expression suggests that his mind is elsewhere.

<b>

Dana and Beatrice can't stop grinning at Colin. Isn't this a bit too cruel?! Is it? But today's training ground is going to be interesting! This isn't the time to be running! They whisper to each other, trying to stifle their laughter.

A strange atmosphere envelops the lunchtime.

Suzy could only tilt her head in confusion.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey, Suzy. I came to see you."

"Hello, Will. Nice to meet you today."

<b>

When Suzy and the others entered the training ground, William, who had already arrived and warmed up, greeted them.

<b>

"Hey! Will! Long time no see!! It looks like you've improved again? I'm looking forward to it."

"Dana, long time no see. It seems like you've improved too. Please go easy on me."

<b>

"Hello, Will! It's been a while! My father said to say hello to you!"

"It's been a while, Beatrice. I'll visit your father tomorrow to greet him. Please convey my regards."

<b>

"Hello, Will... it's been a while."

"It's been a while, Mia. Um... is something wrong?"

<b>

Mia, holding Suzy from behind as if cradling something precious, greeted William, but when he asked her if something was wrong, she turned away and averted her gaze, saying, "It's nothing!"

<b>

William quietly asked Suzy if he had done something to upset Mia, but Suzy only tilted her head and smiled, looking troubled.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, I see that the magic group kids are here today too? Are they here to observe?"

<b>

Trying to change the subject, William looked away from Mia and scanned the other children.

<b>

"I heard you were coming today, so everyone came to greet you."

<b>

Colin announced from the back row of girls.

<b>

"Haha, I was planning to surprise you by suddenly showing up... too bad! It seems like it was too obvious. It's been a while! Colin! I've missed you."

"It's been a while, Will. It's okay, I was surprised. Yes, yes! I was really surprised! I had no idea until just now... I was truly shocked!"

<b>

Huh? That's strange, Colin seems off?

William noticed that Colin's glasses reflected light, obscuring his expression.

He also noticed that Colin's eyes seemed vacant at times.

The atmosphere emanating from Colin's body felt very tense.

<b>

"Uh... Colin? Is something wrong? Did something happen...?"

<b>

William cautiously asked Colin.

<b>

"Is something wrong? Did something happen? ... I see? The first thing you say when you see me is that kind of remark?"

<b>

Oh no, this is bad!

<b>

William instinctively sensed the situation.

<b>

"Wait a minute, Colin. It seems there’s been a misunderstanding."

"Wait? What? Misunderstanding? I don't understand what you mean!"

<b>

William, who is tall, towers over Colin, who is already small for his age.

Despite being looked up at by Colin, William couldn't shake off the feeling of intimidation.

A bead of sweat trickled down his cheek.

<b>

"Uh, um... sorry. If I did something to upset you, I apologize. I'm sorry."

"Oh? Did you do something you need to apologize for?! Are you aware of that?!"

"Uh... um..."

<b>

William desperately tried to think.

<b>

(What?! Why is Colin angry? What did I say?! What did I do?! What was Colin saying? ... Think! Remember!! ...)

<b>

"Um, uh... I-I’m sorry! I should have contacted you sooner!!"

<b>

William suddenly bowed deeply to Colin, glancing at his expression...

<b>

(Was that right? Or wrong...?)

<b>

"Of course! ... Of course, you forgot about me, right...?"

"No! That's not true! I actually planned to visit the Saunders family to greet you before dinner! But, um, I got caught up in a conversation... and then..."

<b>

"Ah, you were so engrossed in conversation... yes, that's right... Suzy is so cute. She's beautiful... it's only natural for a gentleman meeting her for the first time to be captivated... right?"

"I-I no! That's not it! It's not like that at all..."

<b>

"You don't have to force it! You must have been so smitten with Su that you forgot about me, right?!!"

"I-I’m not smitten!! You know I'm only interested in you!! I wouldn't be smitten with anyone else! There's no way I would be!!"

"Wh-what?!!!"

<b>

A chorus of squeals erupted from the girls.

Colin's face turned beet red in an instant.

<b>

"W-w-wait! It's not like I was saying anything about being smitten or not! That's such a crude way to put it!! ... And... and saying that in front of others is just wrong!!"

<b>

Colin turned as red as a boiled lobster, tears welling up in her eyes.

<b>

"Ah... s-sorry..."

"Ugh! Will, you idiot!! I'm not talking to you anymore!!!"

<b>

<b>

Colin dashed out of the training ground like a rabbit.

<b>

"C-Colin! Wait! We still need to talk..."

<b>

William reached out to chase after her but let his hand drop weakly.

<b>

"What are you doing?! Will! This is the time to chase after her! If you don't catch up quickly, things will get even worse!"

<b>

At Beatrice's words, William gasped.

<b>

"Colin, wait! Colin!!!"

<b>

William dashed out of the training ground like an arrow, chasing after Colin to stop her.

<b>

<b>

The ones left inside peeked out the window, watching the unfolding situation with bated breath.

<b>

Colin and William were facing each other, arguing about something, but it was hard to hear outside. They could catch snippets like "You," "I," "Me," "You," but it was unclear.

<b>

Eventually, Colin covered her face with her hands, bowing her head, and began to tremble.

William gently wrapped his arms around Colin, pulling her close.

Colin's arms also wrapped around William's back, and they embraced each other.

A sigh escaped from the girls watching. I feel like they should kiss! I think I heard Dana say that, but I ignored it.

For now, it seemed like a tentative resolution had been reached.

<b>

"Wow, that was amazing! I didn't expect it to get this intense."

"Yeah! If Will had backed down, it would have been a mess! In that sense, it was quite tense!"

"Well then, I saw something interesting! I'm going to go do some running again! I feel like I'm close to grasping something!"

<b>

"Hey... you guys were egging Colin on, weren't you? What would you have done if Will had backed down? ... That's pretty bad taste..."

<b>

Irvin said, looking at Dana and Beatrice with a look of disbelief.

<b>

"Huh? Irvin, you say that? You call him a coward?! ... Even though you're the one who gets flustered! Hmph!"

"Uh... I-I’m going to go do some running too! See ya!! Dana! Wait for me!!!"

<b>

"You ran away again, Irvin."

"You ran away, huh?"

"Hmph!!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

After Suzy finished training with the kids, Dana and Irvin returned from their running session, and just as they were taking a break, William and Colin timidly returned to the training ground.

<b>

Where had the two of them disappeared for over an hour!?

The mystery deepens, but no one says anything.

Suzy was impressed that even though they were all kids... they acted like adults.

<b>

"We're very sorry for the disturbance."

"We truly apologize."

<b>

Colin and William bowed their heads in unison.

They were in perfect sync. Are they a married couple?! Suzy thought to herself.

<b>

"Colin and Will are dating, huh?"

"Y-yeah, well, that's how it is..."

<b>

William turned his head shyly while scratching his cheek.

<b>

"But that's terrible! Dana and Vivi keep saying things that stir up anxiety!"

"Well, well, thanks to that, it seems your bond has deepened! So, it’s all good, right?"

<b>

Dana said with a refreshing smile as she wiped her sweat with a towel she received from Helena, without a hint of remorse.

<b>

"That's right! Now you can hold hands in public like that!"

<b>

Beatrice pointed out, and the two suddenly realized, pulling their intertwined fingers apart in a flurry, their faces turning red.

<b>

"W-we're holding hands!!"

<b>

Colin blushed even more at Suzy's comment...

<b>

"Ugh! Remember this, you two!!!"

<b>

Colin huffed at Dana and Beatrice.

<b>

----------------

...As expected of Suzy.
