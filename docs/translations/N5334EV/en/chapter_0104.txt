# Chapter 92: Arvin Haggard Gets Involved in Trouble

Behind the building that houses the classroom for the first year, there is a place where trees grow thickly, resembling a forest.

This is part of a park designed to surround the main school building, and when Arvin Haggard discovered a well-branched tree near the school, his cheeks naturally relaxed.

This seems like a good spot.

Since it is behind the school building, very few people come here. It is nice to be away from the noise of people and enjoy the quiet.

Arvin climbed the tree smoothly, checked his surroundings, and smiled contentedly.

About ten meters ahead of this tree, there is a forest path that students use for running, but it doesn't bother him at all to sleep up in this tree.

<b>

The tree has thick branches that can support his weight and leafy branches that provide a nice shade.

When the wind blows, the leaves rustle, creating a pleasant sound that is just right for dozing off.

As a place to relax after lunch, it is truly perfect.

<b>

The first week since enrollment has passed in a flurry, and tomorrow will be the first holiday since coming here.

Today's classes ended in the morning, so after a quick meal in the cafeteria with everyone, he decided to take a nice long nap, retreating here while the girls were engrossed in their chatter.

<b>

<b>

However, just as Arvin was satisfied with securing the spot and was about to drift off comfortably, he noticed the presence of someone approaching.

He clicked his tongue in frustration, having missed the chance for a pleasant nap.

But what was lost would not return immediately.

Sighing in resignation, he whimsically turned his attention to the intruder who had disturbed his drowsiness.

Four people approached.

One girl and three boys. They were making their way into the narrow backyard between the school building and the forest.

<b>

Two of the boys stopped at the corner of the school building, while one boy and one girl moved ahead. Are they up to something? The two boys seem to be keeping watch?

But the girl is... following closely behind the boy in front... it doesn't seem forced... huh? What's going on?

Is this some kind of confession event? It's only been a week since school started, and these guys are already in a hurry. Well, the boy looks like a real player...

<b>

As Arvin observed, the boy stopped in his tracks and turned to face the girl.

<b>

"…W-why did you call me out to a place like this… what do you want, Rayleigh?"

"Karen. Do you even understand your position? Huh?"

"W-what do you mean? I-I’m not…"

"Do you know your place or not?! I'm asking you?!!"

"Ah! P-please let go of me!"

"Since you got here, you haven't even said hello! What’s up with that?! Huh?!"

"…………"

"Do you know who you can go to school normally because of?! Huh?! Do you understand?!!"

"………………"

"Tch! You go quiet the moment things get inconvenient… scum!!"

"Ah!"

<b>

As soon as they faced each other, the boy began to raise his voice at the girl.

The girl named Karen was trembling in fear from the boy's voice but was desperately trying to maintain a dignified posture against it.

However, it seemed that the girl's attitude displeased him. The boy named Rayleigh, not bothering to hide his irritation, grabbed Karen's arm.

Rayleigh twisted the arm he had grabbed and ultimately threw Karen to the ground.

<b>

"Hey, isn't that a bit much?"

<b>

Suddenly, a voice came from behind, startling Rayleigh.

He felt a chill for a moment from the unexpected presence in a place that had been empty, but when he turned around, he saw a boy of the same age standing there.

For a moment, Rayleigh's blood boiled at the thought of being startled by such a guy.

<b>

"What the hell are you?!! Ah!!"

<b>

Arvin, standing behind Rayleigh with a nonchalant expression, paid no mind to Rayleigh's threatening attitude and simply reached out to Karen's arm, which was on the ground.

<b>

"Seriously, you shouldn't be knocking a girl down like that... Come on, can you stand?"

"Ah, th-thank you…"

<b>

Arvin took Karen's arm and gently helped her up, quietly allowing her to stand.

Karen was surprised by Arvin's sudden appearance and, while confused, stood up as he pulled her up, finally managing to express her gratitude.

<b>

"You!! Ignoring me, what do you think you're doing?!! Huh?! Don't get in my way when it’s none of your business!!"

"…………It’s not entirely none of my business, though."

"Huh?"

<b>

Rayleigh shouted even louder, but Arvin remained unfazed.

Still, Karen, who caught the small murmur that slipped from his mouth, looked up at Arvin with a puzzled expression.

<b>

"This guy! He’s Arvin Haggard from Class 1! Rayleigh!"

"Ah?!"

<b>

The two boys at the corner of the school building noticed the commotion and rushed over to surround Arvin and Karen.

Then, one of the boys pointed at Arvin and shouted that he knew him.

<b>

"That's him! The guy who said he fought off the bandits that attacked the carriage!"

"Ah? This guy?"

"?!... What do you mean?"

"Hmph! So you’re the self-proclaimed 'hero'…?"

"Huh?"

"And?! You’re here playing the 'hero' again, trying to get in my way?! Huh?! You’re getting pretty cocky, huh?! Hey!!"

"What? What are you talking about?"

"You’ve been spreading the word that you took down a group of bandits all by yourself, right?! Huh?!!"

"…No, I didn’t do it all by myself."

"And? What kind of trick did you use to fool the officials? Huh?!"

"What the hell are you talking about?"

"There’s no way you could take on a large group of bandits by yourself! There must be something behind it!!"

"No, I’m saying I wasn’t alone… Hey, are you even listening?"

"Either way, you definitely used some dirty trick! I’ll expose your true nature!!"

"…This guy… is dangerous."

"Hey! You bastard! Listen to what I’m saying!!"

"No, no, no, wait. You’re the one not listening, right?"

"You! Do you know who I am and are acting all cocky?!!"

"…Is this guy perhaps unable to hold a conversation?… So? Who are you…?"

"You…! You won't understand until you get hurt?!! Ah?! Woody! Ben! Get over here and help me!!"

<b>

Rayleigh shouted angrily at his two companions to try to subdue Arvin.

<b>

Ugh, this is annoying...

<b>

Arvin couldn’t help but feel like he wanted to hold his head in his hands at Rayleigh's behavior.

He never expected someone to be this mentally unstable.

<b>

Should I just knock him out and end it?

<b>

Feeling slightly irritated, he stopped himself from throwing a punch.

If I cause a scene over something like this, I’ll definitely get a long lecture from Bibi...

<b>

Before coming to Amukam, both his mother and Beatrice had repeatedly warned him, "Don’t think it’s the same as being at Amukam!"

<b>

Still, these guys have been making a racket for a while now...

In any case, it’s clear they’re a nuisance!

<b>

<b>

With Rayleigh at the forefront, the three of them lunged at Arvin and Karen, but Arvin protected Karen's body, skillfully dodging their hands while guiding her, maintaining an exquisite position.

Karen, being led by Arvin, sometimes found herself turned around, letting out confused sounds, but Arvin continued to lead her with a smirk on his face.

From a distance, it might look like a girl was hiding behind the school building, awkwardly learning to dance.

However, the furious shouts and desperate expressions of the three chasing them made it clear that this was not a cute scene.

<b>

"Hey, look! …Wow? You’re keeping up well, huh? Haha! This way?"

"Huh? Ah! …Huh? Th-thank you… eek!"

"See? T-tch!"

"Whoa! This guy…!!"

"You! You bastard! Don’t mess with me!!!"

<b>

As the three of them shouted angrily and lunged at them, Arvin and Karen danced away gracefully.

Arvin was guiding her with relatively vigorous movements, but he was slightly surprised at how well Karen was keeping up without losing her balance.

Maybe I didn’t even need to step in? While he thought this, Rayleigh and his two companions stopped, panting heavily with flushed faces, glaring at Arvin and Karen.

<b>

"You guys! Enough already… just stop it! You bastards!!!"

"What? Are you already out of breath? Maybe you need to train harder? If you want, you can join our running practice next time?"

"Ha! Don’t mess with me! You’re messing with me!!! You bastards! I won’t let you get away with this! Huh?! Do you understand?! Karen!!!"

<b>

Karen stiffened slightly and took a step back. But Arvin gently placed a hand on her shoulder to support her.

<b>

"…It’s fine to act tough, but… let’s consider the place, okay?"

"Ah?! The place?!! What are you talking about? No one here…"

<b>

"Hey! You guys!! What are you making a fuss about here?!"

<b>

Rayleigh jumped at the sudden voice and turned around.

There stood a tall, slender student, arms crossed, glaring at Rayleigh with piercing eyes.

From the color of his tie, it was clear he was a senior.

The senior raised his right hand, pushing his glasses up with his middle finger. The blue eyes behind them glimmered coldly.

<b>

"New students, huh? It’s understandable to get excited before your first holiday, but… you should keep it moderate."

"Why… why is there someone here…"

"Well, if you make that much noise, a crowd will gather."

"?!"

<b>

Rayleigh finally noticed the students gathered around, thanks to Arvin's pointed remark.

Despite being behind the school building, many students were lined up at the windows, looking down at them.

They had gradually gathered after hearing the commotion coming from behind the school.

<b>

"It seems you were quite rowdy, huh? I received reports from several students."

"Tch! What the hell! You too?! Are you going to get in my way?!"

"I am Fritz Reinbard from the student council executive committee. If you continue to cause a disturbance, you will face appropriate consequences."

<b>

Rayleigh gritted his teeth so hard it made a sound, glaring at Fritz with burning eyes.

However, Fritz's gaze remained cold, unaffected by Rayleigh's anger.

<b>

"He is Rayleigh Niven from Class 2, from Grusmil, the second son of the Niven family. The two over there are also from Class 2, Woodley Macht and Ben Bozart, also from Grusmil. And the girl over there is Karen Merlin from Class 3… and this is Arvin Haggard from Class 1, from Amukam."

<b>

A small girl appeared from behind Fritz, glancing down at the binder in her hands as she listed the names of the five present.

Rayleigh and his two companions were taken aback, wide-eyed at the sudden appearance of the girl and her ability to accurately name them.

Karen was similarly surprised, but Arvin looked at the girl with admiration.

The girl who emerged from behind Fritz was much shorter than him, by at least two heads.

<b>

Is she possibly shorter than Bibi?

Arvin thought to himself as he looked at the girl.

Next to the tall Fritz, the height difference was striking. It was like an adult standing next to a child.

If they were holding hands while walking, they would definitely be seen as parent and child! A brother and sister with a significant age gap?

Of course, he wouldn’t voice such thoughts… but for some reason, he felt like the girl glared at him.

<b>

Fritz had light brown hair, and his smooth bangs brushed against his glasses frame every time he moved his head.

In contrast, the small girl had long, dark silver-gray hair with a strong wave, tied into two thick braids that hung straight down from her shoulders.

Additionally, her glasses were thick like milk bottle bottoms, in stark contrast to Fritz's thin, delicate ones, making it impossible to read the expression in her eyes.

<b>

"I am Nancy Cruz from the student council executive committee. I am aware of you all."

<b>

While holding the binder in her left hand, Nancy twirled a pen in her right hand, seemingly reading through the documents sandwiched in the binder with her expressionless eyes behind her glasses.

The sight of the two standing together, with such contrasting appearances, was indeed a peculiar scene. Yet, at the same time, it also felt strangely oppressive.

In fact, Rayleigh and his two companions found it difficult to meet their gazes, instinctively beginning to shrink back.

<b>

"I’m giving you a warning. If you don’t listen, you’ll end up with a disgraceful record right after your enrollment."

"Tch! Let’s go!!"

<b>

Rayleigh glared at Fritz and then at Arvin and Karen in turn, leading his companions away with a rough gait.

After watching them disappear around the corner of the school building, Fritz sighed as if relieved and turned to Arvin with a sharp gaze.

<b>

"I’ll let this slide this time, but… you should be careful with your actions."

"I didn’t do anything!"

<b>

Arvin raised both palms toward Fritz, waving them as he asserted that he hadn’t laid a hand on anyone.

Seeing this, Fritz turned away and stepped forward, blocking Arvin’s path.

Fritz stood close enough that their chests almost touched, looking down at Arvin while pushing his glasses up and speaking.

<b>

"I’m saying that careless provocations incite those who don’t know their place. Just because you haven’t laid a hand on anyone doesn’t mean it’s okay."

"………………"

<b>

Fritz spoke to Arvin with a strong gaze, and Arvin, pulling back the lighthearted demeanor he had earlier, looked up quietly, silently accepting his gaze.

Among the students watching from the school windows, many gasped or let out sighs of amazement.

Noticing this, Nancy lightly cleared her throat, redirecting Fritz's attention toward her.

<b>

"……Fritz, that’s enough."

"…Yeah, you’re right. I apologize for stopping you. You all should go now."

"Yes, I will remember your words."

<b>

Arvin lightly bowed and then took Karen’s hand to leave.

Suddenly grasped by the hand, Karen’s cheeks flushed immediately.

While being led by Arvin, Karen bowed to Fritz and Nancy, and then followed Arvin as they left the scene.

<b>

After watching the two disappear around the corner of the school building, Fritz relaxed his body and let out a quiet sigh.

He then turned his body toward the school building and clapped his hands loudly.

<b>

"Alright everyone! The show is over! Those with no business here should promptly leave!"

<b>

At Fritz's voice, the students pulled away from the windows and scattered back into the school.

For some reason, many of the girls leaving seemed to have flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, leaving the scene with an excited demeanor.

Fritz watched this with a puzzled expression, but once the last person disappeared into the depths of the school, he let out a sigh that seemed to express his defeat.

<b>

"…Good grief! It was even more than I heard about! That was something!"

"Indeed… He’s the only new student who noticed my presence."

"I was quite surprised by that. A new student who can see through your 'hiding'…"

"Perhaps what Dana and the others said wasn’t exaggerated after all…"

"That might be true… but! That flirtatious behavior! Is he natural, or is he a kindred spirit of Frank-senpai?!"

"…No, surely that’s…"

"The girls who were peeking seemed to be quite excited too, right?"

"…That was due to the last two-shot between you and him…"

"What? What do you mean?"

"No, it’s something you don’t need to worry about."

"?!… Should I leave it to Frank-senpai as a fellow countryman?"

"…………Fritz? Are you in your right mind?"

"……………………No, I’m sorry. It’s probably more appropriate to have Colin Saunders keep an eye on him."

"That’s right, Colin is suitable. There’s no doubt about it. Let’s leave the matters of Amukam to her."

"…In any case, let’s hope he doesn’t become a headache."

"…I completely agree."

<b>

As they continued their conversation, the two disappeared around the corner of the school building.

Behind them, the noise that had been present until then faded away, and the area behind the school regained its tranquility. Soon, a gentle breeze blew through the backyard, rustling the grass and trees, and the whispers spread throughout the area.
