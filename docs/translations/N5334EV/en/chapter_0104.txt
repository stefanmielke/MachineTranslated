# 92 Irving Haggard, Getting into Trouble.

Behind the building where the first-year classrooms are located, there is a wooded area with trees.

It is part of a forest-like park that surrounds the main school building, and Irving Haggard's cheeks naturally relaxed when he spotted a tree with good branches near the school building.

This looks like a good place.

It is behind the school building, so few people seem to come. I like the quietness of this area, away from the noise of people.

Irving's mouth relaxed with even more satisfaction as he slinked up the tree and checked his surroundings.

About 10 meters beyond these trees, a forest road that the students also use for running in is passing by, but it does not bother me at all as long as I sleep on this tree.

<blank>

The top of the tree has thick branches on which one can lean one's body, and leafy branches that cover the branches, creating a shade that is quite good.

When the wind blows, it shakes the leaves, and the trees make a breezy sound that is just right for sleeping.

It is indeed a perfect place to rest after lunch.

<blank>

The first week of school has passed in a flurry, and tomorrow is my first holiday since arriving here.

Since today's classes were to end only in the morning, I decided to take it easy and sleep after lunch, so I had a quick meal with the others in the main cafeteria and retreated to this place while the girls were chatting away.

<blank>

<blank>

However, when Irving is satisfied with his location and is about to enter a pleasantly micro-sleep, he notices the presence of someone approaching it.

Irving clucked his tongue as he missed out on a comfortable bedtime banana.

But what you miss won't come back immediately.

I sighed, and turned my attention whimsically to the disturber who had disturbed my slumber.

Four people came.

One woman and three men. They proceed to the narrow backyard between the school building and the woods.

<blank>

The two men stopped at the corner of the school building and one man and one woman went ahead. What are you trying to do? The two guys look like lookouts, right?

But the girl is ...... walking properly behind the guy who is walking in the front. ...... You don't mean forcing her, do you? ...... yeah? What do you think?

Is this some kind of confession event? It's been barely a week since they entered the school, and they're so quick-tempered. Well, the guy seems to be a bit of a player. ......

<blank>

As Irvin looked on, the boys stopped, turned around on the spot and faced the female student.

<blank>

"......, call me up here ......, what is it Reilly?"

Karen. Do you know your position? Huh?"

What are you talking about? I don't know, I'm just ......"

I said, "Do you even know where you stand? I said?

Aah! Let go of me, please ......!"

Koch since you entered the school! What do you mean you haven't even said hello? What?

"............"

I said, "Who did it for me to be able to go to school normally like this? You know what I mean? You know what I'm talking about?

".................."

"Tsk! You'll shut up like that as soon as things get bad. ......, you piece of shit!"

Aah!"

<blank>

Immediately after facing each other, the boys began to raise their voices at the female students in a stout manner.

The female student called Karen is frightened by the voice of such a male student, but tries hard to maintain a resolute appearance to resist it.

But he did not like the attitude of the female student. The male student, called Reilly, made no attempt to hide his irritation and grabbed Karen's arm.

Reilly twisted his arm in his grasp and finally pushed Karen to the ground.

<blank>

Hey, what's the big deal?"

<blank>

Reilly's shoulders jumped with a start when he was suddenly approached from behind.

I felt a chill for a moment at the presence that suddenly appeared in an empty place, but when I turned around, I saw a boy of the same age standing alone there.

The thought of being startled by such a man, even if only for a moment, made Reilly's blood boil instantly.

<blank>

What the fuck? Aah!

<blank>

Irving, who had been standing behind Reilly with a shirked look on his face, paid no attention to Reilly's argumentative attitude and went straight to his feet and put his hand on Karen's arm as she fell down.

<blank>

"You're right, there's no such thing as rolling a girl. ...... You want to stand up?"

"Oh, ......, thank you ......, thank you .........."

<blank>

Irving took Karen's arm and pulled her up and quietly helped her to her feet.

Karen is surprised and puzzled by Irving's sudden appearance, but stands up as his arm pulls her to her feet, and she finally, though timidly, says a few words of thanks.

<blank>

What the hell do you think you're doing? How dare you ignore me! Aaah? Don't you dare to interfere with me when I have nothing to do with it!

............ is not all that unrelated, though."

Huh?"

<blank>

Reilly screams even louder, but Irving is having none of it.

Still, Karen caught the little murmur that escaped from his mouth and looked up at Irving suspiciously, a question popping out of his mouth.

<blank>

This guy! It's Irvin Haggard of the first group! Reilly!

Aaah?

<blank>

Two people in the corner of the school building noticed the commotion and rushed over to surround Irving and Karen.

Then one of the boys points at Irvin and says he knows this guy.

<blank>

That's him! That's the guy who said he returned the bandit who attacked his carriage!"

"Uh-huh? This guy?"

?" What's ......?"

"Hmph! You mean you're the self-proclaimed 'hero' summer ......?"

Ah?"

"So? So, here you are again, pretending to be a "hero" and trying to get in my way, huh? Oh? Zibun, you're on a roll, aren't you! What? Hey!

What? What are you talking about?"

"You've been talking about how you beat up a gang of thieves by yourself, right? What?

...... No, I didn't do it alone."

So? What kind of tricks did you use to get the officials to go along with you? Ah?

What the hell have you been saying all this time?"

There is no way a single person can take on a large group of thieves! There's got to be an angle!

No, so you're not alone. ......, hey, are you listening to me?"

Either way, there's no doubt you've played dirty tricks on me! I'm going to take off your skin!

"...... this guy ...... is fucked."

Oi! You son of a bitch! Listen to me!

'No, no, no, no, no, wait. You're the one who's not listening to me."

You! You know who I am and you're taking advantage of me?

I'm not sure if he's a ...... guy, or if he can't even hold a conversation. At ......? Who are you ......?"

You ......! You're gonna have to hurt me to see that, aren't you? Aaah! Woodley! Ben! Get your ass over here and help me!

<blank>

Reilly shouted angrily at his two companions to seize Irving.

<blank>

Wow, that smells like trouble. ......

<blank>

Reilly's words and actions almost made Irving's head spin.

I had not expected him to have so many loose screws in his head.

<blank>

Can't I just punch him out and be done with it?

<blank>

Feeling slightly annoyed, I stop my hand from going out.

If you make a fuss over something like this, you'll definitely get a big lecture from Bibi. ......

<blank>

I remember that before I left Amkam, I was told by my mother and by Beatrice, "Don't think it's the same as being in Amkam! I remember that I had been told by both my mother and Beatrice before I left Amkam, "Don't think it's the same as being in Amkam!

<blank>

But still, these guys have been making too much noise since a while ago. ......

Anyway, I knew he was a nuisance!

<blank>

<blank>

Led by Reilly, the trio grabbed onto Irving and Karen, but Irving protected Karen's body and guided her, while slipping and ducking the three men's hands and taking exquisite positions.

Karen let out a confused sound as Irving pulled her hand and sometimes turned her body, but Irving continued to lead her, keeping the corners of his mouth turned up in amusement.

At first glance, it looks as if the girls are hiding in the backyard of the school building, receiving dance instruction with their poor gait.

But the angry voices and frantic looks of the three chasing after them remind us that this is not such a smiley thing.

<blank>

Yo, look! ...... huh? You're following along nicely, aren't you? Ha-ha! This way?

What? Oh! What about ......? Oh, thank you very much. ...... Kya!"

What? Damn it, damn it!"

He said, "Oooh! This guy ......!

"Hey, you! You son of a bitch! You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

Irving and Karen dodge the three men who grab them with furious shouts as if they were dancing.

Irving was guiding and moving her with a fair amount of intensity, but he was more than a little surprised to see Karen following him with hardly a blip of her torso.

If this is the case, perhaps I didn't even need to get involved? While I was thinking this, Reilly and the other three stopped moving, red-faced and breathing on their shoulders, and stared at Irving and the others as hard as they could.

<blank>

I'm not going to let you do this to me! I mean, come on, ......, come on! You son of a bitch!

What? Are you already out of breath? Maybe you don't train hard enough every day. If you want, you can join us for a run next time."

Huh." Screw you! Fuck you! Fuck you! You, you ...... ain't getting off for free no more! Aaaaah! Do you understand? Kareen!

<blank>

Karen's body stiffens slightly and she backs away. But Irving gently put his hand on her shoulder as if to catch her.

<blank>

"It's okay to be ...... icky, but ....... Let's just think about where we're going, okay?"

"Aaah? Where is it? What the hell are you talking about? This is the place! No one is ......"

<blank>

Hey! You guys! What are you doing here?

<blank>

Reilly's shoulders shook at the unexpected voice, and he turned around.

There was a slender, tall student standing quietly with his arms crossed, staring at Reilly with a piercing gaze.

The color of the tie also identifies me as their senior.

The senior student raised his right hand from his crossed arms and pushed up his glasses with his middle finger. The blue eyes behind them glanced coldly at me.

<blank>

"Are you a freshman? It's understandable to be excited about your first vacation, but ...... you need to keep it in check."

"Why, ...... why are people coming to these places ......?"

You know, with all that noise, you're bound to attract a gallery."

?

<blank>

Irving pointed out with a bitter smile, and it was only then that Reilly became aware of his surroundings.

Even though it is on the back side of the school building, many students line up at the windows and look down on us.

They all heard the commotion echoing from somewhere behind the school building, and gradually gathered there.

<blank>

"You've been very busy, haven't you? I've heard from a number of students.

Chiiiiiiiii! What the hell? What are you doing? You're gonna get in my way, too?

I am Fritz Reinbard of the Student Council Executive Board. If you continue to make a scene, you will be dealt with accordingly.

<blank>

Gritting his teeth until they clench, Reilly stares at Fritz with burning eyes.

But Fritz's eyes are only cold when he is confronted with this indignation.

<blank>

'He's Reilly Niven, from Year 1, Class 2. He's from Grouse Mill, the second son of the Niven family. The two over there are Woodley McDonald and Ben Bossert, also from Grouse Mill, also in Class 2. The two girls over there are Karen Marlin from class 3. ...... and the first class, Irvin Haggard of Amkam."

<blank>

A petite female student emerges from behind Fritz and, looking down at the binder in her hand, lists the names of the five people present, one after another.

Reilly and the other three were taken aback by the sudden appearance of the female student and the fact that she was able to guess their identities without hesitation.

Karen's eyes were wide open as well, but only Irving looked at her in admiration.

Emerging from the shadow of Fritz is a small student who is two heads shorter than him.

<blank>

Are you shorter than Bibi by any chance?

Irving looked at the female students with this impression in his mind.

When lined up with the taller Fritz, the difference in height is obvious. They are like an adult and a child.

If they were walking hand in hand, they would definitely be seen as father and son! Siblings who are not too old?

Of course, I don't speak of such impressions ......, but for some reason I think the female students were staring at me.

<blank>

Fritz's hair is light brown, and his silky bangs brush the frames of his glasses as he moves his face.

In contrast, the small female student's hair was a long, dark, habitual silver-gray, which she wore in two thick pigtails that hung straight down from her shoulders.

Also, in contrast to Fritz's thin, narrow glasses, hers are as thick as the bottom of a milk bottle, and it is impossible to read the expression in the eyes behind them.

<blank>

I'm Nancy Cruz, Student Council Executive Director. I know who you are.

<blank>

Nancy held the binder in her left hand, the pen in her right toying with it in her fingers, and with eyes behind expressionless glasses, she appeared to be taking her time and looking through the documents tucked into the binder.

It is a strange sight to see these two contrasting figures standing together. At the same time, however, it is also strangely intimidating.

In fact, Reilly and the other three could not even make eye contact, and were unconsciously beginning to sit up.

<blank>

I'm warning you. If you don't listen well, you will have a dishonorable career as soon as you enter school."

Tsk." Let's go!"

<blank>

Reilly glared at Fritz and the other two upperclassmen, then at Irving and Karen in turn, and walked away with his friends in tow with a rough gait.

After watching them disappear across the school building, Fritz turned around with a sigh and a sharp look at Irving.

<blank>

I'll let it slide this time, but you, too, ......, must be very careful what you do."

I didn't do anything, did I?"

<blank>

Irving faces Fritz with both palms facing him, waving them in the air and insisting that he has not laid a hand on him.

Fritz saw this and ducked forward, standing directly in front of Irving.

Fritz, who faces Irving at a distance where their chests are about to be attached, looks down on Irving from above and opens his mouth while pushing up the frames of his glasses.

<blank>

I'm saying that easy provocations incite those who don't know their place." I'm not saying that because we haven't laid our hands on them, we can get away with it."

".................."

<blank>

Fritz turned to Irving, looking down at him with a strong gaze, and told him the story.

Irving, having withdrawn his light tone, looks up with a quiet face and silently meets his gaze.

<blank>

Among the students watching from the windows of the school building, there were many who gulped and others who let out a gasp.

Nancy notices this and coughs lightly, bringing Fritz's attention back to her.

<blank>

............ Fritz, that's enough of that."

...... Mm, you're right. I'm sorry I held you up. You guys can go now."

Yes, I will keep your words in mind."

<blank>

Irving bowed lightly and grabbed Karen's hand to leave.

Suddenly, Karen's hand is held, and her cheeks instantly turn red.

Karen bailed out to Fritz and Nancy while Irving took her by the hand, and then Irving led her away.

<blank>

As he watched them disappear over the corner of the school building and beyond, Fritz relaxed his body and sighed quietly.

Then he turns his body toward the school building side and claps his hands loudly.

<blank>

Come on, guys! Show time is over! All those who have no business here, clear out quickly!"

<blank>

At the sound of Fritz's voice, the students leave the window and scatter, disappearing into the school building.

For some reason, many of the female students who left there had cheeks tinted and sparkling, and their excitement had not abated.

Fritz looked at him quizzically, but when he saw the last one disappear into the back of the school building, he let out the biggest sigh of the day, as if to say, "Oh my God.

<blank>

"...... totally! That's more than I've heard! That thing!"

'Yes. ....... He was the only freshman who noticed my presence, you know."

That is indeed a surprise to me. New students who can see through your 'lurking', etc. ......"

I guess you could say that Dana and the others weren't exaggerating when they said that. ......

'Maybe so, ......, but..! That codswallop! Is that natural? Or is he just another one of Frank's senior class?

"...... No, indeed, that's ......"

The girls who were peeking in seemed to be having a lot of fun, too.

"...... that's the last two shots of you and him at ......"

What? What?"

No, you don't need to worry about it.

?" ...... should we leave it to our hometown predecessor, Senior Frank, after all?"

"............ Fritz? Are you insane?"

"........................ No, sorry. I still think it would be appropriate to have Colin Saunders look at it."

Colin is the right person for the job. Colin is the right person for the job. Let's leave the Amcam thing to her and throw ...... her under the bus."

Anyway, I hope ...... doesn't give you a headache."

I totally agree with ......."

<blank>

As they continue their conversation, they disappear together to the other side of the school building.

Later, the back of the school building regained its serenity, as if all the previous noise had been a lie. Soon, a fine breeze blew in the backyard, shaking the grass and trees and spreading its whispering sound to permeate the area.
