# 56 - A Harbinger from DeKembel

"Susie... have you changed a little?"

<blank>

After breakfast was cleaned up and the morning cleaning was done, I was practicing "kata" in the garden when I was approached by Papa Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

After finishing the "ordeal" the day before, I am allowed to take a day off today to recover from the fatigue.

I was told that I could have taken a week off, but I was told that I was free to do so, so I was allowed to take a day off just for today.

<blank>

I was supposed to be on vacation, but I was working out as usual when Papa Howard came to see me.

<blank>

...changed...?"

<blank>

I had just finished the "kata" and took a break to reply.

<blank>

Apparently, Howard had something in mind when he saw me practicing kata.

I never thought I would hear from Howard Papa about the sword!

This is rare! You have to ask properly!

<blank>

Um, sorry, did I interrupt you?"

No, it was a good break. Did ...... change anything for me?"

'No, what would you say... thinner, I guess you'd call it?'

Thin...is it?"

'Umm...should I say that not too long ago, Suzy had a much thicker, stronger presence?'

It was intense...?"

"...have you found something in your training, after all?"

Um...yes, right?

<blank>

Well, I think I've been able to adjust my "skills" a lot through kata practice, but... I wonder if there is that much of a difference in the way they look?

<blank>

'You used to go out at night to practice, didn't you? 'Cause Elrose would scold me if I moved around the house."

<blank>

Then Papa Howard squinted his eyes and looked funny, then showed one eye meditated.

<blank>

"Uh huh? Aaah? ...eh?

<blank>

Oooooohhhh? How did you know? I was using Invisible. How could you possibly know?

Why? Why? Does Howard have some kind of detection skill I don't know about?

<blank>

I have a daughter of her age, and I can't stand to see her out and about at night, but I don't think there's anyone who can do anything about you. Even if there were, it would be a crisis for the village."

<blank>

Ahhh...ahh."

<blank>

...my head and eyeballs were going round and round! Still, Howard Papa's story continued.

I felt awkward and embarrassed that my dad had noticed me when I thought he hadn't found me!

My face is getting so hot! I can't look straight at my dad's face! I can't stay!

<blank>

'And I suppose you made the rounds from time to time, too?

"Huh?"

Sometimes there were monsters with a high threat value that would slip through the forest's security net.... Sometimes the night shift had difficulty dealing with them or discovered them too late.... And so on.

Ah... ah... ah..."

<blank>

The gaze swims around even more.

<blank>

The next day, I searched the area where the battle took place and found only a few traces of the battle, which seemed to have ended unilaterally. The next day, when I searched the site, I found only a few traces of a battle, but it looked like it had ended unilaterally... the way powerful people do. Such a scene was well found."

"Oh... it can be... difficult, can't it?"

<blank>

I can't see any way out!

<blank>

But for some reason, they're always done on the night Susie goes out. Isn't that strange?"

<blank>

Papa gave me a fresh and beautiful smile again!

Forgive me! Please forgive me! The fugitive jail breaker will neither run nor hide anymore! Ahh..!

<blank>

Thank you. You've been protecting Amkam all these years."

<blank>

Ugh? What is this! Howard Papa suddenly bowed down to me?

I thought you were going to be condemned for being a bad girl!

I really don't understand it, do you?

<blank>

How could I have known your movements? You don't look happy about it, do you?"

<blank>

That's right, isn't it? It's impossible to see it in a normal way, isn't it? If you don't have the skill to see through skills, you'll never see them!

<blank>

As I think I've said before, you're usually very present.

<blank>

...presence...strong?

<blank>

That strong presence of yours that was supposed to be there a moment ago, suddenly disappears at night.

Ah!"

<blank>

I thought of a batch!

That's right! It hides the existence of "Invisibles!

If the presence you had felt before suddenly disappeared, you would think it was gone!

<blank>

Ahhhh, ～～～～～～! I wish I could punch myself in the past for saying, "If only I could erase the presence, I'd feel safe and secure♪"!

<blank>

I was wondering if you were on to something during the night. I was wondering if you might be on to something during the night... or not?"

Oh...uh...no...no...uh..."

<blank>

What's with this feeling of being a monkey on a big palm? I can't stay!

<blank>

I've told AnnaMarie that you sometimes leave the house at night. Don't worry about her."

Ah... yes, thank you... thank you very much."

I'm so grateful to you, as the leader of the Protectorate, for looking out for us when we are out of sight.... Thank you again, Susie.

Oh, no! Oh, please raise your head, Daddy Howard! I... no!

But you know... as a parent with a daughter... I would appreciate it if you would do your best to avoid going out at night."

I'm sorry.... No, I will refrain from doing so.

<blank>

I know, right? Normally, if a father knew that his daughter was out at night at such an age, he would stop her, wouldn't he?

<blank>

Thank you, Susie.

<blank>

Then Papa Howard stroked my head with his big hand.

It feels so good to be stroked by big daddy's hands that it makes me go all funy-funy.

I'm sorry. I'll try to refrain as much as possible from now on.

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Congratulations on this achievement. Susie."

Thank you, Dr. Henry.

<blank>

After lunch, I visited Dr. Henry at the temple.

I came to return a book I had borrowed and to ask a few questions.

<blank>

So, you prayed for the success of the ritual today?"

Oh, yes, and prayers, too. I just wanted to drop by to return this to you."

<blank>

With that, he offered the teacher a book he had borrowed.

<blank>

Was this helpful?"

Yes, I have learned a lot. But sir, the names of the brave men are not mentioned in this, are they?"

Hm, yes, because there are no names marked on these..."

Is there a reason why your name isn't listed?"

I am sorry to say that this is the only book on heroes that I have that you can read. Unfortunately, this is the only book on heroes that I currently own that Suzy can read.

<blank>

So, I guess this book is a digest version of the heroic biography? But it is a good choice as an introductory book, don't you think?

<blank>

In the past, we used to have easy-to-understand books on heroes, but the people of AMCAM don't like the word 'hero'..."

<blank>

The doctor looked sad.

Heh, I see, don't people like the word 'brave'? I didn't know that.

<blank>

Nowadays, all I have on hand are books for research purposes, and they are a bit more difficult to understand. The original "Yusha Tsutaeru" also consists of five volumes, and the original is not in the modern language.

<blank>

With that, he pulled out a thick, old book from the bookshelf and flipped through the pages.　You will learn these letters after you go on to higher education...," Henry continued.

<blank>

I see, it was 200 years ago now that a brave man appeared.

Cultural forms have changed since the days when feudalism was alive and well.

The literary style used must have been different....

The records of the time are old and written in a style that must be like the Japanese...Edo period's "koumon". It will be a while before I can read the original text.

Ah, but does the name appear in the original book?

<blank>

His name is not in this book either. The information about the heroes, including their origins and names, was concealed by the royal court at that time, so there are no records of them.

<blank>

Huh? Then why is there still a "Biography of a Brave Man" or something like that? Ah! Is that it? Is that the kind of propaganda that is common in history, where only what is politically expedient is left behind?

<blank>

The doctor nodded his head and said, "That's what I mean.

Even so, no matter how much they have covered up, if you carefully probe them one by one, you will naturally discover their origins.... That is what researchers are for. He said with a refreshing smile.

<blank>

And...Suzy, you've already learned about Baron Kanoe, haven't you?"

He was a key figure in the country's democratization efforts in 2255. And I was taught that this man was a brave man."

Yes, "Baron Suzuka Kustos Kanoe." She is the woman who decided the course of this country. And she is the 'hero of the dawn' himself, a fact known to everyone in this country, even if it was hidden from them by the former state.

<blank>

Oh! I found out the full name of the "heroine"? And it's "The Lady"! It was even revealed that she is a woman!

But why is he only mentioned in a few textbooks when everyone knows him as a brave man? Is there some kind of "story" behind it?

Well, I guess that's what I'm saying when only names are listed.

<blank>

Speaking of which, did you know that the cemetery of the brave is in King's Landing?"

What?" There is a cemetery?"

<blank>

A cemetery in the royal capital while being kept secret by the state? There must be some complicated circumstances....

<blank>

There is a monument to the accompanying person, along with a monument in the corner of the National Cemetery in King's Landing. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the capital.

<blank>

Oh, it's a tourist attraction thing...haha. Is that it? Is it like the Katsuumifune or Sakamoto Ryuuma in the original world?

<blank>

The cemetery in King's Landing is large, but it was originally a monument, so it's only a formality.

<blank>

The doctor looked a little annoyed. Oh, so he is a historical figure? A renegade who wants to hide his treachery, but is so popular among the people that they have erected a statue of him in Onshi Park?

<blank>

The real tomb is located further south in Maius. It's not far enough to go and have a look..."

And, yes...ah, ha ha."

<blank>

Maius" is one of the 12 cities, the same as Dekenbel.

It is located in the southern part of the country, more than 1,500 kilometers away from Dekenberu.

It's over 3,000 kilometers one way...you know, it's a trip all the way across the Kingdom of Aurora! Even if I ran as fast as I could, I don't think I could easily get there and back!

But...hmm? But...what?

<blank>

"? Oh, that 'attendant'?"

An "attendant"? Well... its existence does not appear in any textbooks, nor does it appear in most of our research books. At best, they are treated as one of our collaborators. It is treated as one of the collaborators at best. But you didn't know about the "attendants"?

<blank>

Uh...hmmm...have I heard of this before? I don't think I have...? Hmmm...I don't know!

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm a little confused.

I see... I was wondering if you had heard of this before, since AMCAM has a small amount of material on the attendants.

I'm sorry, Dr. Henry, I had no idea.

No, no, I am the one who should apologize. It's my own conjecture, so it's not for you to apologize.

<blank>

With that, Dr. Henry kept smiling, closed the book he was holding, put it back on the bookshelf, and began looking for a new book.

<blank>

The "attendants" are those who visited the land with the heroes and were said to have worked with them, supported them, and fought alongside them.

<blank>

That! That's the first I've heard of that! Another potential player who was there? The second high level holder?

<blank>

What happened to... that... person?

<blank>

The records of the "attendants" are even fewer than those of the "heroes. We can only find a few traces of them in various places. I think that the records of "attendants" in Amkham are the most numerous..."

<blank>

Mysterious attendants? But, rather than going to King's Landing to search for records of heroes hidden in the country, would it be better to investigate the "attendants" at AMCAM, so that the "investigation of the legend of heroes" will be more successful...?

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy, do you know about the "hill" in the forest of Amkamu?

The "what? The 'hill'...? What hill are you talking about?"

<blank>

Did you suddenly jump from talking about the attendant? Which hill is the teacher referring to?

The forest is full of ups and downs, so there are hills and valleys here and there....

<blank>

It is located 5 kilometers from the entrance of the forest...in the middle of a thickly vegetated forest, there is an open hill that looks like it has been cut off from the rest of the forest. I have been taken there several times for research... It has been more than 200 years since its discovery, but it seems to be the same as before. It is called the 'Hill of the Braves' by our researchers.

<blank>

No, no, I don't know. The Hill of the Braves? I've never heard of it!

<blank>

It is an ordinary hill only 30 meters square, but strangely enough, no demonic beasts invade it. But strangely enough, no demonic beasts invade the place, as if it were warded off.

A place like that?"

<blank>

We call the place 'The Hill of the Braves,' but that's just what researchers call it after reading past records."

<blank>

Dr. Henry stood, closed the faded book in his hand, and placed it laboriously and quietly on his desk.

He then turned his gaze to the north window overlooking the mountains of Aurora and continued his words with a quiet expression on his face.

<blank>

But the people of Amkham still call that hill what it has always been called... 'The Hill of Sorrows.

<blank>

He said this in a solemn tone, as if he were offering a prayer.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After tea and another short lecture on the legend of the heroes, we left Dr. Henry's temple.

<blank>

I got more than I thought I would...I mean...! There's so much information, I can't keep up with it all!

Well, I'll have to organize and compile some information on this....

<blank>

Well, there's no need to rush, so let's just take our time and get on with it. If something comes up that I don't understand, I can just ask Dr. Henry again!

<blank>

<blank>

...And yet, "The Hill of the Brave"...or perhaps "The Hill of Sorrows"....

I didn't know such a place existed.

<blank>

Did I mention it's about 30 meters wide, open and treeless...?

Come to think of it, there might have been a place like that north of the One's Tsumesho.

I think the road led straight from the Tsumesho....

<blank>

Well, with just the kids, we couldn't go beyond the safe zone, and there were no magical beasts even during the night patrols, so we thought it was just one of the battle points and didn't pay any attention to it...

<blank>

<blank>

...But that was the place where the "brave" and the "attendant" appeared.

<blank>

According to the doctor's exploratory magic research, it is known that there is something like a stone stage assembled in a three-dimensional circular shape underground.

Like Stonehenge buried in the ground?

It's like saying, "I'm going to summon something! It's like you're saying, "I'm going to summon something!

<blank>

But still....

An open summoning place where neither forest trees nor magical beasts can approach... right?

<blank>

I can think of a lot of guts, can't I?

<blank>

<blank>

That day I learned for the first time that I had something in common with the heroes.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

As I was thinking about this, I was already right in front of your house.

<blank>

I stayed longer at Dr. Henry's than I thought I would...is it already around 4:00?

AnnaMarie is standing in front of the door. It looks like she's been waiting for me.

<blank>

Did I worry you? I was really planning to leave earlier than I did.

<blank>

AnnaMarie smiled in relief when she saw me.

I smile back at him.

<blank>

AnnaMarie reached for the doorknob and opened the front door before I could get to it.

I thanked AnnaMarie for opening the door for me and went inside the house. I could hear the sounds of dishes being done and water running in the kitchen, indicating that cooking was about to begin.

<blank>

I almost made it! We've only just started preparing dinner.

When I entered the kitchen, Elrose-san was arranging the cooking utensils and Sonia-mama was taking out the meat of the rabbit (already laid down) that I had brought to be processed.

<blank>

That was a close call! We were on the verge of having our food processed by Sonia's hands right now!

<blank>

Oh, my God, Susie, you're back. You didn't have to rush. You can still rest, right?"

No, I want to cook this properly and serve it to Howard Papa! I want to cook it properly and serve it to Howard Papa! I'll take care of it!

I think Howard would like it better if Susie made it. I think Howard would like it better if Susie made it. Okay, I'll be your assistant. Okay?

Yes! Thank you Sonia Mom! I'll do my best!"

So, am I right to make sautéed horned rabbits?"

Yes, I use the thighs for sautéing. We will also make a soup with the meat around the abdomen and root vegetables. I will also use hodo taro that I picked up, so I think it will be a thick soup.

I see. So you're going to put your hands in the dishes you made during the trials?"

Hi! I would love to hear your thoughts!"

"Hmmm, that sounds like fun. I'm sure Howard would love it.

I'll do my best!"

<blank>

<blank>

The cooking was done without delay with the help of Sonia Mama and Elrose.

<blank>

During the process, AnnaMarie reached out to me several times to help, but each time she was blocked by Elrose, who ended up doing the cooking cleanup work.

What is it? I'm getting a dangerous scent from her when it comes to cooking....

<blank>

You don't think he's a perfect superhero, but his cooking is just devastating...? Is that the kind of thespian you're thinking of?

...No way, no way, hey?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The resulting dishes were generally well received.

<blank>

Howard Papa said it was delicious, delicious, and he refilled the soup several times.

Sonia Mama complimented me on how interesting it was to use these spices here.

<blank>

Thanks to this, I was able to enjoy a nice cup of tea after dinner with a moderate sense of accomplishment.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

That night, AnnaMarie agreed to give me a massage in my room after my bath and before bed.

<blank>

It is said that there is something called "magical stiffness," and that people who have a lot of magical power tend to get stiff, and if not regularly relieved, the stiffness can accumulate and become a serious problem if left unchecked and unacknowledged.

<blank>

I had never heard of such a thing before...but I don't mind massages, and I thought it would be a good idea to have one once in a while. I decided to have it done.

<blank>

So I had it done...! This is bad. This is bad! It's bad!

This feels too good, doesn't it?

This is no good...this is the one that will ruin it!

<blank>

It was an oil massage with a towel on the bed...it felt so good that it became a habit! It's so good, it's addictive!

<blank>

It melted! It melted and became taresjy!

How many times have you almost ascended ......?

<blank>

I was so embarrassed that my voice came out on its own, so I buried my face in the pillow, but I'm pretty sure it leaked out...?

Some of them were in a lot of trouble...ahhh.

<blank>

He casually left me a change of clothes, so I knew he was aware... right?

I knew AnnaMarie was mature enough to pretend not to see it....

<blank>

He said it would be better to do it regularly, so the next one would be in about two weeks.

That's what I'm looking forward to, and that's what I'm afraid of...ugh.

<blank>

<blank>

Anyway, before going to bed that day, I felt more restless in bed than usual... but I slept soundly without dreaming and woke up feeling good, so I guess it was good for my health... right?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

However, things were moving in a way that I, who had been enjoying a good night's sleep in peace, was unaware of.

<blank>

That morning, the sun had not yet risen.

The news reached Papa Howard that the pioneer of the Order had arrived at the Amcam House.



<blank>

----------------

"Sue, who is this guy?"

I'm AnnaMarie, your maid of honor. Good morning, Mia.

"A lady-in-waiting...? Hmmm..."

"Mi-Mia? Why are you holding me so tight?"

"You're a maid of honor..."

Then, Master Mia, you will take good care of the young lady, won't you?"

Mia? Hey, is there any power in this?"

...... Sue is mine."

"Uh, uh, Mia? The power..."

I'll take care of your daughter for a moment, okay?"

"Sue-chan is mine, though, right?"

"Um...Mia? Ugh, it's buried, it's buried, okay?"

Just for a moment, please?"

It's mine!

Mia ......?"

I'll leave you alone for a little while...okay?"

It's mine!

"Yeah, uh? Mia?"

<blank>

Next "Envoys of Meridies"

I will start posting again when I have saved up another 5 or 6 stories.
