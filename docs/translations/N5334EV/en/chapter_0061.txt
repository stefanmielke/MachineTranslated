# Episode 56: A Prelude from Dekember

"Suzy... have you changed a bit?"

<b>

After finishing breakfast and completing the morning cleaning, I was practicing my 'forms' in the garden when I was called by Papa Howard.

<b>

<b>

Having completed the 'trial' the day before, I was allowed to take it easy today to recover from my fatigue.

It seems I could have taken a week off, but since that was flexible, I decided to take just today off.

<b>

Even though it was supposed to be a day off, Papa Howard came to see me while I was training as usual.

<b>

"...Changed... you say?"

<b>

I had just finished a round of 'forms', so I took a breath and replied.

<b>

It seems Papa Howard had been watching my practice and had some thoughts about it.

I never expected to receive advice from Papa Howard about swordsmanship!

This is rare! I have to listen carefully!!

<b>

"Um, I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?"

"No, it was a good stopping point. ...But, have I changed in some way?"

"No, how should I put it... you seem to have become less pronounced, perhaps?"

"Less pronounced... you say?"

"Um... until a little while ago, Suzy had a stronger presence, should I say?"

"I had a stronger presence...?"

"...Have you discovered something in your training?"

"Um... I suppose so?!"

<b>

Well, I think I've been able to adjust my 'skills' quite a bit through form practice... but has there been such a noticeable difference in my appearance?

<b>

"You often went out at night to train, right? You can't move around the house without being scolded by Elrose."

<b>

Saying this, Papa Howard squinted his eyes and looked amused, then winked at me.

<b>

"Wha?! Huh? ...Eh?!!"

<b>

Whaaaat?! How did he know? I was using 'Invisible'! He shouldn't be able to sense me!

Why? Why?! Does Papa Howard have some detection skill I don't know about??!!

<b>

"As a parent with a daughter of your age, I can't overlook you wandering out at night... but I don't think there's anyone who could handle you... If there were, it would be a crisis for the village."

<b>

"Ah... ahh."

<b>

...My head and eyes were spinning! Still, Papa Howard continued to speak.

It's so awkward and embarrassing to think I wasn't being noticed, but here I am, completely caught by Papa!

My face was getting really hot! I couldn't look directly at Papa's face! I felt so ashamed!!

<b>

"And sometimes, you've been on patrol, haven't you?"

"Wha?"

"There were times when a high-threat magical beast slipped through the forest's watch. It was tough for the night shift to deal with it, or they were late to discover it... and so on."

"Ah... ahh."

<b>

My gaze was swimming even more.

<b>

"But soon, it would be as if nothing happened. When I explored the site the next day, there were only slight traces of battle, and it seemed to have ended unilaterally... it was the work of someone powerful. It's surprising how often such sites are found."

"Ah... that can be quite serious, can't it?"

<b>

I can't see any escape route for myself!!

<b>

"But for some reason, it always seems that the extermination is done on the nights you go out. Isn't that strange?"

<b>

Once again, Papa smiled brightly at me!

Please forgive me! Please let me off the hook! I won't run away or hide anymore! Aah!

<b>

"Thank you. You've been protecting Amukamu all along, haven't you?"

<b>

Wha?! What is this?! Did Papa Howard suddenly bow his head to me?!

Wasn't I supposed to be judged as a delinquent daughter?!

I really don't understand what's going on here?!

<b>

"You're looking puzzled about how I noticed your movements, aren't you?"

<b>

Of course I am! It's impossible to think normally! You can't see it unless you have a skill to see through skills!!!

<b>

"As I mentioned earlier, your usual presence is strong."

<b>

...A strong presence?

<b>

"That strong aura of yours, which should have been there until just now, suddenly disappears at night."

"Ah!"

<b>

I suddenly realized!

That's right! 'Invisible' completely hides my presence!

If the aura I felt until then suddenly vanished, anyone would think I was gone!!

<b>

Ughhh! I want to punch my past self who thought I could relax as long as I could hide my presence!!!

<b>

"The night after Suzy's presence vanished, you usually practice a new form. I thought perhaps you were grasping something during the night... was I wrong?"

"Ah... um, n-no... um."

<b>

What is this feeling, like I've become a little monkey proudly sitting on a big palm? I can't bear it anymore!

<b>

"I've told Anna Mary that you sometimes leave the house at night. You don't have to worry about her."

"Ah... yes, thank you..."

"You being out of our sight is something I'm truly grateful for as someone who leads the militia... Let me thank you again, thank you, Suzy."

"Th-that's not necessary! P-please raise your head, Papa Howard! I..."

"But you see... as a parent of a daughter... I would appreciate it if you could refrain from going out at night as much as possible."

"...Ah, yes... I'll do my best... no, I'll refrain from going out."

<b>

That's right! Normally, if a father knew his daughter was wandering out at night, he would stop her!

<b>

"Thank you, Suzy."

<b>

Saying this, Papa Howard gently patted my head with his large hand.

It felt nice being patted by Papa's big hand, and I felt all fuzzy inside.

Um... I'm sorry. I'll try to refrain from going out as much as possible from now on.

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Congratulations on your success. Suzy."

"Thank you very much, Henry-sensei."

<b>

After having lunch, I visited Henry-sensei at the temple.

I returned the book I had borrowed and intended to ask him a few questions.

<b>

"So, today is for the prayer of success for the ritual?"

"Ah, yes, while it's for the prayer, I also came to return this."

<b>

Saying this, I offered the book I had borrowed from him.

<b>

"Did this help you?"

"Yes, I learned a lot from it. But, sensei, the name of the hero isn't mentioned in this, is it?"

"Well, that's right. The name isn't recorded here..."

"Is there a reason why the name isn't included?"

"...Well, this book can be considered a summary of the hero's legend, or a commentary, if you will. Unfortunately, this is about all I have in terms of books related to heroes that you can read, Suzy."

<b>

So, this book is a digest version of the hero's legend? But it seems like a good choice as an introductory book.

<b>

"In the past, there were easier-to-understand books about heroes, but... the people of Amukamu don't like the term 'hero'..."

<b>

The sensei looked a bit lonely as he said this.

Oh, really? So, everyone doesn't like the word 'hero'? I didn't know that.

<b>

"Now, I only have research books, which are a bit more difficult. The original 'Hero's Legend' consists of five volumes, and the original text isn't in modern language."

<b>

As he said this, the sensei took out a thick, old book from the bookshelf and flipped through the pages. "I think you'll learn this kind of writing after you advance in your studies..." he continued.

<b>

I see, the hero appeared 200 years ago.

The cultural forms have changed since the feudal system was still in place back then.

The literary style used must have been different too...

The records from that time are written in an old style, probably similar to the classical Japanese... like the Edo period's classical writing. It seems it will be a while before I can read the original text.

Oh, but does the original text mention the name?

<b>

"The name is not included in this book either. After all, the hero's information, including their origin and name, was concealed by the royal court of that time, so it hasn't been recorded."

<b>

Huh? Then why is there a 'Hero's Legend' left? Ah! Is it that? The typical propaganda where only politically convenient things are preserved in history?

The sensei nodded, agreeing with that notion.

Even so, no matter how much they tried to conceal it, if you carefully investigate one by one, you will naturally uncover their origins... That's what researchers do, he said with a bright smile.

<b>

"By the way... Suzy, you have already learned about Baron Kanoe, haven't you?"

"Ah, yes. I learned that he was a central figure during the democratization of this country in 2255, and that he was the hero."

"That's right, 'Suzuka Kustos Kanoe'. The woman who determined the fate of this country. And she is the 'Hero of Dawn', a fact that everyone in this country knows, even if the former state tried to hide it."

<b>

Oh! I just learned the full name of the 'Hero'?! And she's a 'heroine'! It's clear now that she's a woman!!

But if everyone knows about the hero, why is there so little about her in textbooks? Is there some sort of 'backstory'?

Well, the fact that only the name is mentioned already suggests that.

<b>

"By the way, do you know that there is a tomb of the hero in the royal capital?"

"Huh? There's a tomb?"

<b>

A tomb in the royal capital while being concealed by the state? It seems like there are quite complicated circumstances surrounding it...

"There is, in a corner of the national cemetery in the royal capital, alongside the monument of her companions. It's one of the popular tourist spots in the royal capital."

<b>

Oh, so it's a tourist attraction... haha. Is it like the statues of famous figures in my original world, like Katsu Kaishu or Sakamoto Ryoma?

<b>

"Although the tomb in the royal capital is large, it's more of a memorial, so it's merely a symbolic structure."

<b>

The sensei said this with a slightly troubled expression. Ah, so it's treated like a historical figure? They want to hide the fact that she was a traitor, but since she's popular with the people, they put up a statue in a park... something like that?

<b>

"The real grave is located further south in Maius. It's not a distance you can just visit casually..."

"Oh, I see... ah, haha."

<b>

'Maius' is one of the twelve cities like Dekember.

It's located over 1,500 kilometers south of the royal capital, across from it.

A round trip of over 3,000 kilometers... I can't imagine being able to go there and back easily, even if I run with all my might!!

...Huh? But... wait a minute?

<b>

"Huh? What do you mean by 'companions'?"

"The 'companions'? Well... their existence is not mentioned at all in textbooks, and they hardly appear in research books either. They are treated as merely one of the collaborators... However, you didn't know about the 'companions'?"

<b>

Ah... um... I think I've heard of them? Or maybe I haven't? ...Hmm, I don't know!

<b>

"I'm sorry, I don't quite understand."

"I see... I thought there might be some materials about the companions in Amukamu, so I assumed you might have heard something."

"I'm sorry, Henry-sensei, I had no idea."

"No, no, it's my fault for assuming. You don't need to apologize, Suzy."

<b>

Saying this, Henry-sensei smiled and closed the book he had in his hand, returning it to the shelf and starting to look for a new book.

<b>

"The 'companions' are said to be those who came to this land with the hero, acted together, supported her, and fought alongside her."

<b>

So! This is the first time I've learned this! So, there was another potential player?! A second high-level holder?!!

<b>

"S-so... what happened to that person...?"

<b>

"The records of the 'companions' are even scarcer than those of the 'hero'. You can only find a few traces of them in various places. Perhaps the materials remaining in Amukamu have the most records of the 'companions'..."

<b>

A mysterious companion?! But rather than searching for the concealed records of the hero in the royal capital, it might be more fruitful to investigate the 'companions' in Amukamu for now...?

<b>

<b>

"Do you know about the 'hill' in the forest of Amukamu?"

"Huh? The 'hill'? Which hill are you talking about?"

<b>

Did he suddenly jump from the companions to a hill? I wonder which hill he is referring to?

The forest is quite hilly, so there are many hills and valleys scattered around...

<b>

"Beyond 5 kilometers from the entrance of the forest... in a place where the dense trees open up as if cut out, there is a hill. I've been taken there several times for research, and it seems that even after over 200 years since its discovery, its state hasn't changed. Among researchers, we call that place the 'Hero's Hill.'"

<b>

"I-I don't know about that. 'Hero's Hill'? That's the first I've heard of it!"

<b>

"It's just an ordinary hill, about 30 meters square. However, strangely, magical beasts do not invade that place as if a barrier has been set up."

"...A place like that?"

<b>

"We call that place 'Hero's Hill', but that's just a name given by researchers based on past records."

<b>

Henry-sensei stood up, closed the faded book he had been holding, and gently placed it on the desk.

Then, he turned his gaze toward the northern window overlooking the Auroral mountains, and continued speaking with a solemn expression.

"However, the people of Amukamu have always called that hill... 'The Hill of Lamentation.'"

<b>

He said this in a solemn tone, as if offering a prayer.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After having tea and receiving further lectures about the hero's legend, I left Henry-sensei's temple.

I gained more than I expected... or rather! There was so much information that I couldn't keep up with organizing it!

Okay, I need to sort this information and summarize it...

Well, there's no need to rush, so I'll take my time and do it. If I come across something I don't understand, I can just ask Henry-sensei again!

<b>

<b>

...By the way, 'Hero's Hill'... or rather, 'The Hill of Lamentation'...

I didn't know there was such a place.

<b>

He mentioned it was about 30 meters wide, an open area without trees...?

Now that I think about it, there might be such a place north of the first outpost.

I think there was a straight path leading from the outpost...

<b>

That's right, the kids couldn't go beyond the safe zone, and even during night patrols, magical beasts didn't appear, so I thought it was just one of the battle points and didn't pay it any mind...

<b>

<b>

...But that was the place where the 'Hero' and the 'Companion' appeared.

<b>

According to the exploration magic investigation conducted by the sensei, there seems to be something like a three-dimensional circular stone stage buried underground.

It feels like a Stonehenge buried underground?

It really seems like it's saying, "We're going to summon something here!"

<b>

But still...

An open summoning place where neither the trees of the forest nor the magical beasts approach...

<b>

I'm getting a lot of ideas here?!

<b>

<b>

That day, I learned for the first time that I had an unexpected commonality with the heroes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As I was walking while thinking about such things, I was already in front of my house.

<b>

I ended up staying longer at Henry-sensei's than I expected... it's probably past 4 o'clock now?

Anna Mary was standing in front of the entrance. It seemed she was waiting for me.

<b>

Was she worried? I had planned to return much earlier.

<b>

When Anna Mary saw me, she smiled with relief.

I returned her smile.

<b>

Before I could reach the entrance, Anna Mary quickly reached for the doorknob and opened the door for me.

I thanked Anna Mary for opening the door and entered the house, where I could hear the sounds of dishes being arranged and water running from the kitchen, indicating that cooking was about to begin.

<b>

That was close! I made it just in time! Dinner preparations had only just begun.

As I entered the kitchen, Elrose was arranging the cooking tools, and Sonia Mama was taking out the meat of the horned rabbit (already rested) that I had brought to prepare.

<b>

That was really close! I was just about to have the ingredients cut by Sonia Mama!

<b>

"Oh, welcome back, Suzy. You didn't have to rush. You can still take your time resting, you know?"

"No! I want to cook this properly and have Papa Howard enjoy it! I'll do it right!"

"...I see, you're right. Howard would be happier if you made it. Alright, I'll be your assistant, so make sure to do well, okay?"

"Yes! Thank you, Sonia Mama! I'll do my best!"

"So, is it alright to make sautéed horned rabbit?"

"Yes, I'll use the thigh meat for the sauté. And I'll make a soup with the meat around the ribs and root vegetables. Since I'm using the Hodimo potatoes I brought, I think it will be a rich soup."

"I see. You're going to add your cooking from the trial, aren't you?"

"Yes! I'd love to hear your feedback!"

"Hehe, that sounds fun. Howard will surely be pleased."

"I'll do my best!"

<b>

<b>

The cooking progressed smoothly with the help of Sonia Mama and Elrose.

Along the way, Anna Mary tried to help several times, but each time she was stopped by Elrose, and she ended up just tidying up after the cooking.

What is it? She gives off a dangerous vibe when it comes to cooking...

<b>

Could it be that she's a perfect person but completely hopeless in the kitchen? Is that a typical trope?

...No way, right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

The dishes we prepared turned out to be generally well-received.

Papa Howard praised the soup, saying it was delicious and asked for seconds multiple times.

Sonia Mama also complimented me, saying, "It's interesting to use this spice here."

<b>

Thanks to that, I felt a pleasant sense of accomplishment and enjoyed the tea after the meal.

<b>

<b>

<b>

That night, after taking a bath and before going to bed, Anna Mary was going to give me a massage in my room.

<b>

I heard that there is something called "magic power stiffness," and that people with a lot of magic power tend to get stiff, and if not regularly relieved, it can accumulate without them realizing it, leading to serious issues.

<b>

I had never heard of such a thing, but... I don't dislike massages, so I thought it would be fine to have one occasionally.

<b>

So, I went ahead and got one! And it was amazing. It was incredibly good!!

It felt too good!

This is bad... this is going to be addictive!

<b>

I laid a towel on the bed, and while receiving an oil massage on top of it... this feels too good; it's going to become a habit! It's too much!!

<b>

I melted! I turned into Talessuzi!

How many times did I almost reach heaven... uh, never mind...

<b>

I was embarrassed because I involuntarily let out sounds and buried my face in the pillow, but I'm sure I made some noise, right...?

There were some pretty intense moments too... ahh.

She casually left a change of clothes, so she must have noticed... right?

Being able to pretend not to see is definitely a sign that Anna Mary is an adult...

<b>

Since it's said that it's better to do it regularly, the next time will be in about two weeks.

I'm looking forward to it, but also a bit scared... ugh.

<b>

For now, that night, I fidgeted more than usual in bed before sleeping... but I slept soundly without dreaming and woke up feeling good, so maybe it's good for my health?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

However, while I was enjoying such peaceful sleep, events were unfolding without my notice.

<b>

That morning, before the sun had risen.

News reached Papa Howard that the vanguard of the knight order had arrived at Amukamu House.

<b>

----------------

"Su-chan, who is this person?"

"This is the maid Anna Mary. Good morning, Mia-sama."

"A maid...? Hmm..."

"M-Mia? Why are you holding her so tightly?"

"She's a maid..."

"Then, Mia-sama, please take care of the young lady, okay?"

"Mia? W-What's with the grip?"

"......Su-chan is mine, you know."

"Eh, um, Mia? Your grip..."

"For a little while, please take care of the young lady, okay?"

"Su-chan is mine, you know?"

"Um... Mia? Y-you're going to crush me!"

"For just a little while, please?"

"She's mine!!"

"Mi-Mia...?"

"For just a little while, I'll be borrowing her... okay?"

"She's mine!!"

"Eh, um? Mia?"

<b>

Next time: "The Envoy of Meridies"

I'm sorry! I've run out of material!! This is where the posts end for now;

I'll start posting again once I have 5-6 more chapters, so please look forward to it then <m(__)m>
