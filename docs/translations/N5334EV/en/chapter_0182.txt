# 170 Episode Hexagom's Tavern

The place where I was told by the innkeeper that I could have dinner was not a very pretty restaurant.

Again, it's a speakeasy in the middle of nowhere, this one!

I think there's been an increase in these kinds of bedfellows lately.

<blank>

Well, it's not that I don't like them.

It's like a messy downtown tavern, not too cozy. I think I can hear a voice from the depths of my distant memory saying, "It's not so bad.

<blank>

After all, isn't it better to enjoy a good meal when everyone is together around the table without being overbearing? Just like common people!

<blank>

But at the same time, I can't help but be exposed to the unsolicited stares of those around me.

Well, it's not surprising that they stand out because of these men.

<blank>

First, the client, Roderick.

He seemed to be in a good mood the whole time and was smiling with great joy.

Every time Mr. Roderick lets out a loud laugh, people around him look at him.

<blank>

<blank>

And Rudri, the leader of this escort mission.

Two members of Mr. Rudri's team and elves, Namiena and Sareina.

<blank>

Mr. Rudri is a big-bodied, she-ha-ha, dynamite-buddy person, so his unevenness is ghastly.

In a way, as good as Aria? Yes, Suzyeye says that Mr. Rudri is better in the degree of melioration!

The light leather armor they wear is like a traditional costume and exposes a lot of skin.

I mean, a butt is just a piece of string, isn't it?

Isn't that Fundosi?

<blank>

The view of the healthy inner thighs peeking out from the grass-slip hanging down to the bottom at the front is quite heinous.

The large chest armor protruding from the body also looks as if it is about to pop off, unable to fit into the leather armor.

So overall, we think the stimulus is a strong figure!

<blank>

<blank>

Ms. Salaina wears a robe, as she is a magician, but the slit on the side of the robe is so deep that whenever she walks, it opens up to her waist, revealing her white legs to the public!

When sitting in a chair, the line to the waist peeks out through an open slit. ......

Isn't that look HAITENAIn by any chance?

The breast area is ............ ah, a fine thing, to be sure, but the opening is large and dangerous from some angles ...... Kiken Is it ......? I wonder?

<blank>

Why is the skin ratio so high, even though Namiena is also equipped with armor?

Her healthy white thighs are eye-catching, popping out in all their gnarly glory. The metal weed sliders are attached around her waist, but why is she wearing such a revealing high-leg? The slit goes lightly above her waist, doesn't it?

The upper body is ...... quite severe, but the metal armor with a large chest opening is ...... well, it fits.

<blank>

This may be an area that neither Namiena nor Sareena should touch too much.

So I gently looked away from the two of them, and for some reason my eyes met Bibi's there.

Again, he wanders around as if he didn't see anything.

<blank>

Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!

Bibi is coming over to look at me with his awesome eyes!

It's nothing, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm not saying that "Nuhu is a status! I'm not saying that!

<blank>

Well, in short, I would like to say that Mr. Rudri's team is not only talented, but also very eye-catching.

Mr. Roderick's attention will inevitably increase with .......

<blank>

I'll be right with you! You're the best ............, by any chance, this princess, are you unaware?"

<blank>

Rudri's eyes widened in surprise as she looked at me, but she immediately shifted her gaze to Bibi as if to confirm something.

Bibi takes it in stride and nods broadly, letting out a sigh.

<blank>

What? What do you mean?

You want to say I stand out?

Nope! I'm aware that I'm well formed, you know?

I mean, there is, but it's nothing compared to the dynamite presence of Mr. Rudri, right?

If Mia were next to me, my presence would be blurred by the overwhelming volume of things!

I'm in disguise, for the most part!

Right? Right?

<blank>

"...... Oh, I see. Unaware."

Yes?"

<blank>

Mr. Rudri is laughing dryly, as if he were dumbfounded.

What do you mean?

<blank>

And then there are three Amcam people, Bibi, Mia and myself.

I'm a lady with a wig, though!

I hate to say it, but there are only beautiful women here.

<blank>

Surrounded by six such beauties, Roderick was, from his side, in a veritable harem!

The sound of men's gnashing of teeth can be heard from everywhere.

<blank>

The order of seating is that Roderick takes the center seat and I take the seat to his left.

To my left sat Bibi and Mia, and to Roderick's right were Rudri, Nami, and Saleh, followed by seven people around a round table.

<blank>

No, no, you have a very admirable hostility towards me.

<blank>

Mr. Roderick said it in such a casual manner.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now, let me explain a little abruptly about De Kembel's administration.

<blank>

Unlike other counties, Nasantorca County, where De Kembel is located, does not have a head house.

The center of government is run by the county councilors, known as the "seven seats.

The county councilors are composed of the consuls of each county and intellectuals, and the seven highest seats are elected once every seven years from among the county councilors.

In short, there is an election.

<blank>

Next year will be the seventh year, and this year, the legislators are holding more frequent parties.

Well, I guess it's just a political gathering to confirm their connections and factions.

<blank>

That is why the current "7 seats" and those who will be in charge of the next generation will be present at this year's party. The current "7 seats" and those who will lead the next generation are sure to attend the party.

Re-elections and seat swaps will be the result of the elections.

Lobbying at these events is indispensable, he says.

<blank>

Annie's birthday party the day after tomorrow is one such gathering.

You might say, "How can you use a child's birthday party to play politics? But Annie herself knows this and says, "The bigger the party is, the more friends I can invite, and the more I can enjoy it! She is indeed Aunt Liliana's daughter.

<blank>

In case you are wondering, Roderick is one of the current "7 seats".

So, of course, he plans to attend the party the day after tomorrow.

<blank>

However, if there are those who find Ms. Roderick's presence alienating, they will by all means want her to be absent.

Maybe they are planning to do more than that. ......

<blank>

Still, a cautious partner would suspect that there is more to it than that, going out at a time like this!

Most of the people at the end of the line have no idea what they're doing."

I don't think we'll ever know the power of the Kochs.

<blank>

Rudri, Bibi, and the others are sneaking around, talking to each other as they bring the food on the table to their mouths.

<blank>

Roderick, who was at the center of the table, coughed and looked around at all of us sitting at the table. Then, he spoke slowly.

<blank>

We'll be heading to Lien Canal first thing tomorrow morning as planned. We'll leave him here, so please take care of him!"

We'll take care of it!"

<blank>

<blank>

Roderick, trying to be as loud as possible so that those around him could hear him, said.

In turn, Bibi and Mia also nodded with a loud reply.

And I show them "hello" in a small voice.

<blank>

Well, I am the "this girl" as Roderick calls her. ......

Is this okay? Doesn't it look like a trifecta?
