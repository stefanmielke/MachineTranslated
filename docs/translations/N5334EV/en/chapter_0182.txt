# Chapter 170: The Hexagum Tavern

The place I was told I could eat at the inn was hardly what you would call tidy.

This is definitely a rundown tavern, right?!

I feel like I've been encountering more places like this lately.

<b>

Well, I don't particularly dislike it or anything.

It feels like a cluttered downtown izakaya, and the atmosphere isn't bad. I feel like a voice from a distant memory is echoing that sentiment.

<b>

After all, isn't it more enjoyable to gather around the dining table without any pretense? Just like common folks!

<b>

However, at the same time, there's no escaping the unreserved gazes from those around us.

Well, given this group, it's unavoidable that we stand out.

<b>

First, there's our client, Mr. Roderick.

He seems to be in a great mood, laughing heartily.

Every time Mr. Roderick lets out a loud laugh, eyes turn toward us.

<b>

<b>

Then there's Mr. Rudri, the leader of this escort mission.

And the two elves on Mr. Rudri's team, Ms. Namiena and Ms. Sareina.

<b>

Mr. Rudri is a big guy with a dynamite body, so his curves are quite striking.

In a sense, he's on par with Aria? No, according to Suzy, Mr. Rudri's level of definition is even higher!

The light leather armor he wears resembles ethnic clothing and reveals quite a bit of skin.

Isn't his rear just held up by a single string?!

Isn't that FUNDOSI?!

<b>

The way the healthy inner thighs peek out from the grass skirt hanging down in front is quite fierce, I think.

The large breast armor protruding from his leather armor looks like it could pop off at any moment.

Overall, I think his appearance is quite stimulating!

<b>

<b>

Ms. Sareina, being a magic user, is wearing a robe, but the slit on the side of her robe is ridiculously deep, opening up to her waist with every step, showcasing her white legs to everyone!

When she's sitting, the line from her waist peeking through the open slit...

Isn't that possibly HAITENAI?!

Her chest... well, it's certainly delicate, but the opening is large, so depending on the angle, it could be dangerous... risky... maybe?

<b>

Why does Ms. Namiena, who is also in armor, have such a high skin exposure rate?

Her healthy white thighs are sticking out, drawing attention. She has a metal grass skirt around her waist, but why is she wearing such a daring high-leg outfit underneath?! That cut goes up to above her waist, right?

Her upper body... it's quite imposing, but the metal armor with a large opening at the chest... well, it fits well.

<b>

This might be an area that Ms. Namiena and Ms. Sareina shouldn't touch too much.

Thinking that, I gently avert my gaze from the two of them, only to unexpectedly lock eyes with Vivi.

Once again, I quietly wander my gaze away as if I hadn't seen anything.

<b>

Hiiiii!

Vivi is staring at me with intense eyes!!

It's nothing, I'm sorry! I didn't say anything about "Nyu being a status!" or anything!!

<b>

Well, in short, I want to say that Mr. Rudri's team is not only powerful but also quite eye-catching.

Mr. Roderick's level of attention inevitably rises as well... 

<b>

"Wait a minute! No matter how you look at it, you're the most... could it be that this princess is unaware of it?"

<b>

Mr. Rudri looked at me with wide eyes in surprise, but quickly shifted his gaze to Vivi as if to confirm something.

Vivi responded with a sigh and a big nod.

<b>

What? What does that mean?

Are you saying I'm standing out?

No! I am aware that my appearance is well-formed!

I know, but I can't compare to Mr. Rudri's dynamite presence, right?

If Mia is next to me, my presence would be overshadowed by her overwhelming volume!

Besides, I'm in disguise right now!

Right?! Right?!

<b>

"Ah, I see. Unaware, huh."

"Yes?"

<b>

Mr. Rudri let out a dry laugh, seemingly exasperated.

What does that mean?!

<b>

And then there's Vivi, Mia, and me, the three members of the Amukamu group.

I'm in a lady's disguise with a wig on!

I don't mean to brag, but there are only beautiful people here.

<b>

Surrounded by such six beautiful people, Mr. Roderick is, from an outsider's perspective, in a harem situation!

I can hear the grinding of teeth from the men around us.

<b>

The seating arrangement is centered around Mr. Roderick, with me sitting on his left.

To my left are Vivi and Mia, and on Mr. Roderick's right are Mr. Rudri, Ms. Nami, and Ms. Sare, making a total of seven of us around a round table.

<b>

"No, no, the hostility is quite evident."

<b>

Mr. Roderick said this in a carefree manner.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, let's take a moment to explain the administration of Dekember.

<b>

In the Nasanturka district where Dekember is located, unlike other districts, there is no head family.

The administration is carried out by district councilors known as the "Seven Seats."

The district councilors are composed of consuls from each district and knowledgeable individuals, and these top seven seats are elected from among the councilors every seven years.

In other words, there are elections.

<b>

Next year marks that seventh year, and this year, parties are being held frequently by the councilors.

Well, I suppose it's a political gathering to confirm each other's connections and factions.

<b>

For that reason, those currently in the "Seven Seats" and those who are likely to take over in the future must attend the parties held this year.

Re-elections and seat changes will result from the election outcomes.

Lobbying in such settings is said to be indispensable.

<b>

Annie's birthday party the day after tomorrow is one such gathering.

It might be said that using a child's birthday party for politics is... but Annie herself is quite savvy about it, saying, "The bigger the party, the more friends I can invite, so it will be that much more fun!" She certainly has the strength of being the daughter of Aunt Liliana.

<b>

By the way, Mr. Roderick is currently one of the "Seven Seats."

So, of course, he plans to attend the party the day after tomorrow.

<b>

However, if there are those who resent Mr. Roderick's presence, they would likely wish for him to be absent.

Perhaps they might be plotting something even more than that...

<b>

"If they're cautious, they might suspect that there's something behind going out at a time like this!"

"The lower ranks are mostly thoughtless."

"I don't think they can grasp our strength."

<b>

While bringing food to their mouths, Mr. Rudri and Vivi are whispering such conversations.

<b>

In the center of the table, Mr. Roderick cleared his throat and looked around at us seated at the table. He then spoke up.

<b>

"Well then, as planned, we will head to the Rien Canal first thing tomorrow morning. Please take care of this child we leave here!"

"Leave it to us!"

<b>

<b>

Mr. Roderick raised his voice so that those around could hear.

In response, Vivi and Mia also nodded with big replies.

Then I quietly murmured "Thank you" to the two of them.

<b>

Well, the "this child" Mr. Roderick refers to is me...

Is this really okay? Does it not look like a third-rate play?
