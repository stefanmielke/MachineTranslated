# Chapter 208: Love is Fate, Fate is Death

From the wounds of the giant body lying on the ground, fine white fibrous substances were overflowing along with blood.

They writhed grotesquely in the pool of blood spreading around, but soon disappeared as if dissolving into the atmosphere.

By themselves, they had no power to reconnect broken cells.

If they came into contact with the atmosphere alone, they could not maintain their existence.

<b>

Now that the being that governed them was gone, they tried to gather again within the body, but the 'Qi' swirling inside still did not allow it.

<b>

They flowed out into the outside world along with the spilled blood, writhing small and disappearing like splashes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The stone pavement that had been neatly laid out on the observation deck was now cracked and upheaved in various places.

The modest lights that had gently illuminated the surroundings had now lost more than half of their brilliance.

<b>

"Did we defeat it...?"

<b>

In this place, which no longer resembled the calm space just moments ago, the giant body of the synthetic magical beast was twitching slightly.

Sitting flat on the ground, Cordelia stared blankly at the scene and involuntarily murmured.

<b>

"！ Cordy！！"

<b>

Karen, having relaxed her stance, noticed Cordelia and hurriedly ran over to her.

<b>

"Cordy! Are you okay?! Are you hurt?!"

"I'm fine, Karen. Look, just like this... Ouch!"

"Cordy?! Cordy! Is something hurting?! Are you injured?!!"

"No, just a little on my hand..."

"Show me! ...What is this? It's rotting? That's terrible..."

<b>

Karen took Cordelia's hand and, upon seeing her palm, widened her eyes and frowned.

<b>

Cordelia's palm was painfully swollen and red, as if it had rotted.

<b>

"W-why... is it like this?"

<b>

Seeing it in such a state, like a burn, tears naturally welled up in Karen's eyes.

<b>

"I-it's okay, Karen! It doesn't hurt as much as it looks! I just used 'Healing Wind', and if I get treated by a priest later, it'll heal right away!"

<b>

Seeing Karen's eyes welling with tears, Cordelia hurriedly reassured her.

<b>

This was probably the doing of the so-called 'linear magical life form'.

While using 'Familiar's Blessing', pain had shot through her hand that had been touching the magical beast.

It must have been trying to invade through her hand.

Thinking back on it now, it was a chilling thought, but that thing probably didn't have the power to directly pierce human skin.

<b>

"I'm fine. It stings a little, but..."

"Even so! You're being too reckless, Cordy!"

<b>

Cordelia felt that way, but if she voiced it, her friend would only worry more than she already was.

So Cordelia quietly smiled at Karen, assuring her that she was okay.

<b>

"I'll use the healing ointment I got from Su-chan."

<b>

Karen took out a small bottle from the pouch at her waist.

It was shaped like a small test tube, about 1 centimeter in diameter and 5 centimeters long.

The mouth was sealed with a cork, and inside was a pale red liquid.

<b>

"They said it would heal minor burns and scrapes in no time..."

<b>

She flicked off the cork with one hand, and as she tilted the container, the pale red viscous liquid dripped out.

Karen dropped it onto Cordelia's palm.

The liquid spread across her palm, disappearing as it seemed to dissolve into the wound.

<b>

"...Ah, it doesn't hurt anymore."

"Really?! Let me see!"

<b>

The healing ointment made by Amukam, which was passed down from Suzy, was far more effective than anything they knew.

The medicine that dissolved into the wound quickly repaired the rotting skin.

<b>

Karen took Cordelia's hand, cautiously running her fingers over her palm and asking, "Does it hurt?"

When Cordelia nodded, Karen wrapped both of her hands around that hand.

<b>

"K-Karen?!"

"I'm so glad! I was really worried about what would happen if such a beautiful Cordy's hand stayed injured!"

"…Geez, Karen."

<b>

With her hand still held by Karen, Cordelia's cheeks flushed slightly.

Holding Cordelia's hand, Karen turned her gaze to the faint blue light visible from the observation deck... the light emitted by the barrier device.

<b>

"Now, let's go back to everyone. They must be worried by now."

"Yes, it seems like things are quite chaotic down below..."

<b>

The monsters had said that the barrier device was activated.

And the unpleasant presence felt from deep within the forest...

<b>

She had also sent a message about Sturgeon. The county knights would likely act soon.

Even if a magical beast stampede were to occur, it shouldn't easily reach the human settlement.

<b>

Still, they must have noticed that they were missing down below.

If they didn't return for a long time, people might be sent out to search for them.

If that happened now, it would undoubtedly become a significant burden.

Before that could happen, they needed to regroup with everyone quickly.

<b>

Seeing Cordelia's thoughtful expression, Karen spoke up.

<b>

"Don't worry, Cordy! I'll protect you!"

"Yes, with you by my side, I'm not afraid of anything!"

<b>

A slight strength filled Karen's hand as she held Cordelia's hand.

Seeing that hand, Cordelia tilted her head slightly, wondering what was wrong.

<b>

While looking at their clasped hands, Karen thought again, "I'm really glad Cordy is safe."

<b>

Just the thought of anything more happening to Cordelia tightened her chest with a terrifying grip.

That's why she felt even more joy at the sight of Cordelia safe in front of her.

<b>

Karen took Cordelia's hand, holding it tightly once more.

In doing so, she felt that the bond they had formed in their childhood was something solid.

That bond was now tying the two of them even stronger.

<b>

No matter what happens from now on, they believed they would be together.

They truly felt that they would never let go of this hand.

As Karen's conviction solidified, something warm overflowed within her.

Cordelia must have felt the same way.

The two looked at each other and, without either prompting, smiles broke out.

<b>

"Alright! Let's go, Cordy!"

"Yes! Karen!"

<b>

They intertwined their fingers and, hand in hand, stepped forward toward the exit of the observation deck.

<b>

<b>

<b>

At that moment, Karen felt something blue flash at the edge of her vision.

A small sound like slicing through the wind reached her ears.

<b>

"Ka-hyu?!"

"…………Eh?"

<b>

She felt something warm bounce against her cheek.

Karen's brain couldn't keep up with what had just happened right in front of her.

Only a dazed voice escaped her lips.
