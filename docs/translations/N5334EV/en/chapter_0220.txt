# 208 Love is Destiny, Destiny is Death

A fine white fibrous substance was overflowing from the wound on the huge body on the ground, along with blood.

It stirred fearlessly in the pools of blood that spread around the area, but soon disappeared as if melting into the atmosphere.

By itself, it has no power to connect and heal broken cells.

If it touches the atmosphere on its own, it will not be able to maintain its own existence.

<blank>

Now that there is no longer an entity to control them, they try to come together again, but the "Ki" that is still swirling inside them will not allow it.

<blank>

They flow out into the outside world one after another with the overflowing blood, and disappear like droplets in a small flailing stream.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The cobblestones that had been neatly laid out on the observation deck are now crushed and frayed on all sides.

The modest light that had gently illuminated the area had now lost more than half of its luster.

<blank>

Did you manage to defeat ......?"

<blank>

The huge body of the synthetic magical beast is bouncing around in this place, which is no longer the calm space it used to be just a few moments ago.

Cordilia, sitting on the ground and looking at the scene in a daze, made a small remark.

<blank>

"!　Cody!

<blank>

Karen, who was unprepared, noticed Cordelia and rushed over to her and called out.

<blank>

Cody!　Are you okay?　Are you hurt?

I'm fine, Karen. See this ......, oh pain!"

Cody?　Cody!　Where does it hurt?　Are you hurt somewhere?

No, I have a few hands ......"

Let me see."　...... What's this?　Is it sore?　It's terrible ......"

<blank>

Karen takes Cordelia's hand and looks at her palm, her eyes widen and she frowns.

<blank>

Cordelia's palm was painfully red and swollen, as if the whole area was sore.

<blank>

Hey, why ...... like this?

<blank>

Karen's eyes naturally welled up with tears as she looked at the burns.

<blank>

It's okay, Karen!　It doesn't hurt as much as it looks!　I just used the 'healing wind' and I'm sure I'll be fine as long as I get the treatment from the priests later!"

<blank>

Seeing Karen with tears in her eyes, Cordelia wound up as if in a panic.

<blank>

<blank>

Perhaps this is the work of the "linear magical life form".

The hand that had been in contact with the beast during the entire time he was using the "blessing of the follower" was in pain.

I am sure they were trying to invade here through their hands.

It is horrifying to think about it now, but I don't think that thing had the power to directly penetrate human skin.

<blank>

I'm fine. It does tingle a little, but it's ......"

Still!　You're being too reckless, Cody!"

<blank>

Cordelia felt such a thing, but if she mentioned it, this friend would worry her even more than she does now.

So Cordelia turns to Karen and smiles quietly, saying it's okay.

<blank>

I'm going to use some of the wound medicine Sue gave me."

<blank>

Karen pulled one of the vials from her hip pouch.

It was shaped like a small test tube, about 1 cm in diameter and 5 cm long.

Its mouth is corked and filled with a light red liquid.

<blank>

He said a minor burn or scrape would heal in no time. ......

<blank>

Popping the cork with one hand and tipping the container with the other, a light red, thick liquid drips out.

Karen dropped it into Cordelia's palm.

The liquid spreads in the palm of the hand and disappears as if melting into the wound.

<blank>

...... Oh, it doesn't hurt anymore."

Really?　Let me see!"

<blank>

The Amcam-made wound medicine, given to them by Suzy, is far more effective than anything they know.

The medicine dissolved into the wound and repaired the sore skin as it was seen.

<blank>

Karen takes Cordelia's hand, runs her fingers fearfully over the palm of it, and asks, "Does it hurt?" She asks, "Does it hurt?

When Cordilia nodded, Karen wrapped her hands around them with her own.

<blank>

Karen?

I was so glad to hear that!　I was really worried that Cody's beautiful hands would be left bruised!"

"...... Oh my god, Karen."

<blank>

Cordilia's cheeks are faintly tinted as she holds Karen's hand.

Holding Cordelia's hand, Karen turned her attention to the lights emitted by the small, pale blue lights ...... warding device that she could see from the observation deck.

<blank>

Come on, let's get back to the guys. I'm sure they're worried about us right now."

I guess so. And it looks like it's a lot of work down there, too. ......"

<blank>

The demon said that the warding device had been activated.

Then there was also a bad feeling I felt from deep in the forest: .......

<blank>

I also sent word of Sturgeon. Perhaps the county knight will move soon.

Even if there is a stampede of magical beasts, it should not be so easy to harm a human village.

<blank>

Still, I think they realize they are not there down there.

If they don't return anytime soon, people may be assigned to search for them.

Letting them do that now would definitely be a huge burden.

We must join up with everyone as soon as possible before that happens.

<blank>

Karen sees Cordelia's thoughtful expression and speaks to her.

<blank>

I'll protect you, Cody!　I'll protect you!"

I agree. With Karen, I'm not afraid of anything!"

<blank>

Karen's hand, holding Cordelia's, is filled with a little bit of strength.

What's wrong with your hand? Cordilia tilted her head.

<blank>

As she looked at the hand she was holding, Karen thought again. I'm so glad Cody is okay."

<blank>

Karen feels a terrible tightening in her chest just at the thought of anything more happening to Cordelia.

That is why I am even more delighted to see Cordelia in safe and sound form in front of me now.

<blank>

Karen took Cordelia's hand, which she tilted her head, and squeezed it tightly once more.

In this way, I feel that this bond we formed when we were young is a solid one.

It now binds them together more strongly.

<blank>

I can believe that no matter what happens in the future, they will be together.

I truly felt that I would never let go of this hand.

Karen's heart overflows with hotness when she is so sure.

I am sure Cordilia feels the same way.

They looked at each other, and a smile broke out on both of their faces.

<blank>

Let's go, Cody!　Let's go, Cody!"

Yes!　Karen!"

<blank>

Hand in hand, interlacing their fingers, Karen and Cordelia both stepped forward to head for the observation deck's landing.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, Karen felt something blue pass the edge of her vision.

A small, wind-swept sound reaches your ears.

<blank>

Kahyuh!

"............ yeah?"

<blank>

I felt something warm bounce against my cheek.

Karen's brain cannot process what just happened in front of her.

Only a stunned voice escaped from his mouth.
