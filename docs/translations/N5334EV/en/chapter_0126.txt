# 114 Episode 114 Leave it to Annie!

What do you mean? Ron."

Just as I saw it.

No, I don't know! I don't know!

<blank>

Lombardo's curt response is met with an involuntary tsk-tsk from Irving.

<blank>

For the most part, I don't understand the situation.

I tried to find the head chef in the cafeteria, who was in charge there, but there was no sign of him inside.

Suddenly, I noticed that there was a lot of noise outside, and when I came outside, I found that the head chef had a scrunched-up face in front of Annie.

What do you say happened in this short period of time?

<blank>

I don't understand.

<blank>

Oi! Irving! Lombard! You guys know this kid?

<blank>

Toby, the head chef, shouted to Irving for help.

<blank>

Yeah, but..."

Then do something about it!"

No, so what's the situation?"

This man was trying to ramble on to these kids!"

I didn't!

<blank>

Annie stood in front of Toby, protecting the two small children, and gave him a sharp look.

In response, Toby complains to Irving that it was a misunderstanding.

<blank>

I don't know, man. Toby, what's going on?"

<blank>

This little guy was asking me to do his job, and I told him I couldn't do it, so I turned him away."

<blank>

'These kids just rolled out the door! This man threw these little ones out!"

I was like, "No, no! I opened the door and it just rolled right off. ......"

<blank>

Irving knows. He knows it empirically.

When a girl is going through a rough patch, if you object poorly, as far as I'm concerned, it's not going to get you anywhere.

<blank>

Especially the more impassioned a girl is, the more she knows never to touch it once it is lit.

I know things very well, in familiar places!

<blank>

I don't think it's manly to play nice!"

<blank>

Irving looked up at Annie, who was even angrier than before, and wondered what she had seen.

Whenever Toby says a word back, Annie's verbal attacks intensify.

<blank>

My brothers also said.

A girl is a girl, no matter how young. They should not go against an angry girl.

<blank>

Once this happens, a poor stimulus can be fatal.

Irving quietly and gently turned away from Toby, who was being punched and sandbagged by the words.

<blank>

Then, as if there is only one way to solve the problem, he addresses the other party.

<blank>

'Did you guys do something terrible to this old guy?'

Oh, no, that's not true."

They haven't done anything to me.

<blank>

But they threw you out the door, didn't they?"

I was so scared I fell over!"

I fell down with him!

<blank>

The two of them are in sync with each other. If you look closely, they both look alike.

Are these guys twins?

<blank>

What brings you guys to this place?"

I'm here to get a job!"

I want my money!"

<blank>

Work?

Mark told me this before!"

I've been hired here!"

<blank>

Who's Mark?"

I was with you before!"

I'm the same guy who used to work with you!"

<blank>

Why did you want the money?"

My sister is in trouble!"

I'm trying to save my sister!

<blank>

When I asked her why the "lady" was having a hard time, she didn't really get the point and didn't really understand.

But it was clear to Irvin that the two were serious about wanting the job.

<blank>

Toby, have you ever put a kid to work before?"

<blank>

Irving, who had somehow relaxed his anger toward Toby slightly, turned to Annie, who had been listening to these children, and Toby, who was still quiet, and asked the stern-faced man.

<blank>

No. ...... work?"

They must have tricked me and stiffed me anyway!"

No, no! That's not ....... Yeah, but I'd call it work, ah, ......."

Do you have any idea what's going on?

The other day there was a little boy who wandered into the house. I fed him leftovers, and he said he was thanking me and helped me sweep the floor.

"......"

I'm not sure why you're staring at me, girl! I once gave her a five-kuple copper coin as a reward. ......

<blank>

"5c hey ....... You guys talking about that?"

I'm not sure."

I don't know, but he said he cleaned up!"

I said I got it!

<blank>

Apparently, these twins had come here to work together, relying on what they had heard before.

<blank>

We're going to clean up!"

We want to work!

<blank>

Toby is in charge of this diner.

Even if we are dealing with such a young child, if we let him work here, that is a decision Toby can make on his own.

I don't know how I'll excuse myself to my sister later. ......

<blank>

Irving turned his attention back from the twins to Toby and asked probingly.

<blank>

What do you think, Toby? Are you going to let these guys do their job?"

What are you talking about, Irving? I can't believe I'm leaving these kids in the hands of such a rambunctious man!"

<blank>

Annie, with an angry look in her eyes, slams Toby with one word, "Such a rambunctious person," and complains to Irving that she cannot accept entrusting these children to him.

Toby, confronted with a hard stare, looks momentarily intimidated, "Ugh! but he still makes his will known.

<blank>

'Yes, pretty much! In the kitchen, there are knives and fire! What do you think will happen if you tip over the oil? You can't just let a little kid like this in here!"

But you've had him do it before, right?"

I was cleaning the hall. I didn't let them in the kitchen.

<blank>

I see," sighed Irving, speaking to Annie in a hushed tone.

<blank>

Toby is a sweet old man with a bad mouth," he said. The point is, he doesn't want the kid to get hurt. You're worried about your kids, right? Right?

"...... shut the fuck up."

'Stop it, don't go red ...... nice old man is disgusting.'

Shut up!

<blank>

I don't trust him! It's too dangerous to entrust these children to such a man!"

<blank>

Annie, who looked at the two of them with a scowl, was still incredulous and prodded.

Irving looks at Toby with eyes that see something unfortunate.

<blank>

But Annie, who was still in a rough state, had a small hand outstretched to her.

<blank>

Please, onee-chan, we want to do a job! We want to work!

Onee-chan, please! We want to clean the house!

"......?!"

<blank>

Annie received the request head-on as the twins came up beside her, grabbed her by the sleeves from both sides, and looked up at her with wide eyes.

And for that moment, I froze in my tracks.

As she gazed into those moist, glassy, cerulean blue eyes, she felt something rising up from deep within her chest.

<blank>

"...... lady?"

I'm begging you! Onee-chan!"

Onee-chan! I'm begging you!"

<blank>

Every time the twins call me "Onee-chan," something deep in my chest grows. I can't take my eyes off of them.

<blank>

Something is swirling inside Annie right now.

<blank>

My favorite brother William, my sister Colin, and my gallant sister Sue. ......

<blank>

Until now, I have been a "younger sister," the one who is protected.

There was also the feeling and joy of being constantly protected by the older brothers and sisters that I admired.

<blank>

At the same time, however, he was also aware that he always had a thirst to catch up and stand in line.

<blank>

I'm going to go to ...... and ask her, "Hey, lady? You mean me?"

I said, "Yes, I am! I'm a onee-chan! I'm a onee-chan!"

"......!!!!"

<blank>

Here and now are young children who call themselves "Onee-chan" and come to rely on and cling to me.

He looks at me like he does when he depends on his brothers and sisters, and he clings to me, asking me to do something about it.

<blank>

"...... got it."

<blank>

It was then that something was born within Annie.

<blank>

I'll take care of everything! I'll take care of everything!

<blank>

"Huh?!"

<blank>

Irving and Toby asked, "What is this kid talking about all of a sudden?" They shouted at the same time.
