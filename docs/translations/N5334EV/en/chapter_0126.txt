# Chapter 114: Leave It to Annie!

"What does this mean? Ron?"

"It's just as you see."

"No! I don't get it!!"

<b>

Arvin couldn't help but interject at Ronbart's blunt answer.

<b>

Overall, the situation was quite unclear.

He had tried to find the head chef, who was responsible for the dining hall, but it seemed he wasn't inside.

Suddenly noticing the commotion outside, he stepped out to find the head chef, Toby, grimacing in front of Annie.

What on earth happened in such a short time?

<b>

It didn't make sense.

<b>

"Hey! Arvin! Ronbart! Do you guys know this kid?!"

<b>

Toby, the head chef, called out to Arvin as if seeking help.

<b>

"Yeah, I do."

"Then do something about it!"

"No, but what’s the situation here?"

"This person was trying to bully these kids!"

"I wasn't!!"

<b>

Annie stood in front of Toby, protecting the two small children, glaring sharply at him.

In response, Toby pleaded with Arvin, claiming it was a misunderstanding.

<b>

"Yeah, I still don't get it. Toby, for now, just tell me what happened."

<b>

"These little brats were saying they wanted to work, so I just sent them back, saying that was impossible."

<b>

"These kids rolled out from the door! This person threw such small children out!!"

"N-no! They just rolled out as soon as I opened the door..."

<b>

Arvin knew. He knew from experience.

That when a girl is in a rage, opposing her carelessly leads to nothing good.

<b>

Especially with passionate girls, once they get fired up, you should never touch them.

He knew this all too well from personal experience!

<b>

"I think making excuses isn't very manly!!"

<b>

Seeing Annie's anger escalate beyond what it was before, Arvin looked up to the heavens, as if to say, "I told you so."

Every time Toby tried to say something, Annie's verbal attacks grew fiercer.

<b>

His older brothers had said the same.

No matter how young they are, girls are still girls. You should never oppose an angry girl.

<b>

Once it reached this point, any careless provocation could be deadly.

Arvin quietly averted his gaze from Toby, who was being battered by words like a punching bag.

<b>

Then, as if the only way to resolve this was to speak to the other party involved, he turned to the other person.

<b>

"Did this old man do something terrible to you?"

"No, that's not true."

"Nothing happened."

<b>

"But you were thrown out from the entrance, right?"

"I-I got surprised and just rolled out!"

"I rolled out too!"

<b>

They really seemed to be in sync. Upon closer inspection, they looked very similar.

Are they twins?

<b>

"Why did you come to this place?"

"We came to get a job!"

"We want money!"

<b>

"A job?"

"Mark said something before!"

"He said we could work here!"

<b>

"Who is Mark?"

"He was with us before!"

"He was the older brother who was with us!"

<b>

"Why did you want money?"

"My older sister is in trouble!"

"I want to help my older sister!"

<b>

Even when he asked why that "older sister" was in trouble, he couldn't quite grasp it.

However, Arvin understood that the two were genuinely seeking work.

<b>

"Toby, have you ever made kids work before?"

<b>

Arvin had unconsciously eased his anger towards Toby and turned his attention to Annie, who was listening intently to the children's story, and Toby, who had also quieted down, and questioned the stern-faced man.

<b>

"Well... work?"

"You're just trying to trick them and make them work, aren't you?"

"N-no! That's not it... But, well, I guess you could call it work..."

"Do you have any idea what you're talking about?"

"There was a little brat who wandered in the other day. I fed him leftovers, and he helped clean the floor as a thank you."

"…"

"W-why are you glaring at me, girl?! And I did give him 5 copper coins as a tip, but…"

<b>

"5c, huh... Is that what you’re talking about?"

"“We don’t really understand.”"

"We don't know, but he said he cleaned!"

"He said he received something!"

<b>

It seems these twins came here relying on a story they heard before, hoping to get work together.

<b>

"We want to clean!"

"We want to work!"

<b>

The person in charge of this dining hall is Toby.

Even if it’s such young children, if they were to work here, it would be Toby's decision alone.

He didn't know how he would explain it to the boss later...

<b>

Arvin turned his gaze back to Toby and asked, probing.

<b>

"So, what do you say, Toby? Are you willing to let them work?"

"What are you saying, Arvin! I can't leave these rambunctious kids with this guy!"

<b>

Annie, with a gaze filled with anger, threw the words "this rambunctious guy" at Toby, pleading with Arvin that she couldn't accept leaving these kids with him.

Toby, confronted with her fierce glare, showed a moment of hesitation, but still insisted on his stance.

<b>

"F-first of all! The kitchen has knives, and we use fire! What do you think would happen if oil spilled?! There's no way I can let such little kids in here!"

"But you let them work before, right?"

"That was just cleaning the hall. I didn't let them into the kitchen."

<b>

I see, Arvin sighed and spoke to Annie in a calming manner.

<b>

"Well, you see, Toby may have a bad mouth, but he's actually a kind old man. The point is, he doesn't want to see kids get hurt. He's worried about them, right?"

"…Shut up."

"Don't turn red... It’s creepy for a good guy to be like that."

"Shut up!!"

<b>

"I can't trust someone like that! It's way too dangerous to leave these kids with a person like him!"

<b>

Annie, looking at the two with suspicious eyes, firmly rejected the idea, still unable to believe it.

Arvin looked at Toby with a disappointed gaze.

<b>

However, just then, small hands reached out towards the still agitated Annie.

<b>

"Please, big sister! We want to work!"

"Please, big sister! We want to clean!"

"…?!"

<b>

Annie was taken aback as the twins approached her, grabbing her sleeves and looking up at her with big eyes, making their request directly.

In that moment, she froze.

Staring into their glass-like, cerulean blue eyes, she felt something welling up from deep within her chest.

<b>

"…Big sister?"

"Please! Big sister!"

"Big sister! Please!"

<b>

Every time they called her "big sister," something deep within her grew larger. She couldn't take her eyes off them.

<b>

Right now, something was swirling within Annie.

<b>

Her beloved brother William, her sister Colin, and the dignified sister Su...

<b>

Until now, she had always been the "younger sister," a being who was protected.

She had always felt the joy and reassurance of being protected by her admired older brothers and sisters.

<b>

But at the same time, she was always aware of her desire to catch up and stand alongside them.

<b>

"…Big sister? Are you talking about me?"

"“Yes! You're the big sister! Please!!”"

"…!!"

<b>

Here, there were young children who called her "big sister" and were relying on her.

They looked at her with the same eyes she had when she relied on her brothers, pleading for her to do something.

<b>

"…I understand."

<b>

At that moment, something was born within Annie.

<b>

"I understand! Leave everything to me!!"

<b>

"“Huh?!!”"

<b>

Arvin and Toby both exclaimed simultaneously, "What is this child suddenly saying?"
