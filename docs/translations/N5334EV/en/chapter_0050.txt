# 45 The Cloud Family's Dinner

Nice to meet you, young lady. I am Magritte Gauche, the leader of the advance team of the 12th Mobile Heavy Knights.

I'm Djimon Reetzmann, likewise. Pleasure to make your acquaintance."

'This is Raisa Ulunova. Miss!"

<blank>

When I got home from school that day, I was introduced to two women and a man by Papa Howard, and one by one I shook hands with each of the three guests from the Order.

<blank>

<blank>

I had an image of the Knights wearing full plates, but this was not the case. They were wearing short, camel-colored, shoulder-length, silhouette, rider's jacket (?) like jacket and leather pants.

The feet are knee-high boots. No, they are covered with a white plate, so I guess they should be shin guards. I am not sure if it is correct or not.

The cuirass is ...... and you're taking it off because you're indoors.

It was on the couch where I was sitting.

<blank>

This cuirass and shin guards alone make it look like a full plate knight.

But the design looks more like plate-covered rider boots and gloves than medieval armor, which is very modern.

<blank>

If anything, the outfit looks like a pilot's suit from a science fiction movie.

Or people who are getting rid of ...... something, like ......?

Well..! I think the reason I find it "cool" is because it touches my inner kitchen spirit!

<blank>

<blank>

Ms. Magritte is about Alicia's height, a crisp beauty with dark brunette hair braided and gathered on top of her head.

Is it because he is in charge of the unit that he has one more line on his jacket shoulder patch than the other two?

<blank>

Mr. Djimon is a head taller than Mr. Magritte.

Her short-cropped black hair and chiseled gray eyes give her a strong will, but her soft smile reveals a gentle personality.

<blank>

Raisa is a little petite, looks red in some light, has beautiful honey blonde hair cropped around her shoulders, and is a pretty lady with a cute smile.

<blank>

<blank>

I apologize for interrupting your conversation.

I was just about to leave. I have done what I had to do and was about to leave. It was fortuitous for me to finally see the face of the Princess of Rumor."

I am ......, no, no! I'm not, son, no. ......"

She is as charming as they say she is."

I'm going to brag to everyone in the troop! I met the princess of AMCAM today!"

"...... ah, eh? ...... ah, eh?"

<blank>

What do you mean? Why are you calling me a princess?

I was about to say, "I'm not a princess or anything like that!

Because he's a knight? Because I'm a knight? It's a rule that knights treat girls like princesses, so what?

Howard Dad, please stop with that smug look on your face!

<blank>

<blank>

While I was flustered, the three knights left.

I was half-conscious, astride my own horse, seeing off the returning knights.

However! I immediately came to my senses and told Howard Papa .......

<blank>

It's terrible! Why didn't you admonish me? I'm not a princess! I was so embarrassed!

<blank>

I protested in a defiant manner, feeling my face flush, but Dad said, "Ummm, they are quite a sight to behold! He nodded his head and said, "Mm, mm, mm, mm!

If you think so, you can find Sonia Mama at .......

<blank>

I keep telling you Suzy is a princess, don't I?"

<blank>

And then he came after me!

When he says something like that with a big smile on his face, I can't help but giggle ......!　I flinch.

<blank>

It can't be helped, my lady. ......

<blank>

Elrose explained.

<blank>

<blank>

They are an organization based in the center, i.e., King's Landing, from the beginning.

<blank>

Although it has been more than 150 years since the aristocratic system was abolished, there is still a strong tendency to respect the position of the nobility at the center of the country.

For them, who are registered in such a central place, it is in a way natural to treat the daughter of a former lord's family as a princess. ......

<blank>

What's that? Isn't that a bit anachronistic?

I'm not a daughter, after all! I'm a commoner!

And what's that? 'Rumored Princess'?

I don't remember being gossiped about by strangers!

<blank>

No, your daughter was recently active in Copetown. ......

<blank>

When Mr. Elrose said this with a smile, I couldn't take a second look at him.

<blank>

Oh, that's not such an active thing, is it?

<blank>

With these unsettling thoughts in my mind, I returned to my room, changed my clothes, and immediately began helping prepare dinner.

<blank>

We had decided to cook tonight using the "amukam boa" that we had all hunted the other night, and I was to be the main meat cook.

<blank>

<blank>

Amkam boas, like jackalopes, are not magical beasts, but boars that live in the Amkam forest.

<blank>

The meat has a few quirks, but is quite popular for its rich flavor.

<blank>

They may look like them, but they are nothing compared to the Nantokanushi-like hexenbiests I once ate!

When it comes to that taste, you can find it at .......

Oh, no. ....... That taste still makes me cry when I remember it. ...... Traumatic in a way.

So we're going to override this trauma with boa meat!

I'm going to taste it, you know... contra-fucking-shit!

<blank>

<blank>

The main course is a steak of ribs and braised arm meat in red wine.

<blank>

The arm meat is prepared with a knife while being taught how to handle it by Sonia-mama.

<blank>

Insert a knife into the tibia bone as if scraping it off, and peel off the meat.

Mom teaches me how to cut the meat from the bone.

<blank>

What do you think? I think I've got it apart pretty good, don't you? Hmmm! How do you like it? I'm not the same person I used to be. I can dismantle things properly now!

After all, I'll be living in a survival situation for a week starting the day after tomorrow! Don't think I'm with the old zero survival skills! I'm not!

<blank>

Sorry .......

For some reason, I got heated up on my own.

He seemed strangely excited to be able to process meat. ......

<blank>

The meat is ready, so we start cooking the tots.

Sonia Mama teaches me how to fry, stew, and remove the lye.

The stove requires a lot of care in adjusting the heat, as I am used to using a gas stove.

I used to make mistakes all the time.

Gently peek at the expressions on the faces of Mama Sonia and Ms. Elrose.

For the time being, it seems to be proceeding without problems.

<blank>

After a round of cooking, we are given a taste of the onion sauce for the stew and steaks.

Mama Sonia and Ms. Elrose smiled back at me.

Yes!

When they saw this, they both rolled their eyes.

Elrose chided her for being so "petty," and Sonia-mama laughed.

<blank>

<blank>

The dishes other than the main course were prepared by Sonia Mama and Elrose.

Dinner is served to the table and dinner begins.

<blank>

Howard Papa was smiling and happy to eat the food anyway.

Well, speaking for myself, I think I did well enough this time.

Cooking on the stove was really difficult at first!

<blank>

The meat is tender and melts on the tongue.

<blank>

The steak also soaks up flavor with every bite, and the onion sauce further enhances the taste.

Ooo! The deliciousness soaks into my body with happiness...! Paint the trauma!

<blank>

<blank>

Over dinner, the topic of conversation turned to the knights who had arrived in the evening.

Those people visited Howard Papa to greet him as a pioneer.

<blank>

The thaw this year has been unexpectedly fast. ......

<blank>

Originally, a survey team was supposed to be sent to the Iroquois Great Forest before last fall.

That departure was delayed for various reasons, winter arrived, and the departure was extended to this spring. ............

<blank>

NARUKHODO.

Narhodone .......

De DiPaola's mutation? I wonder if that's possible?

What sounds like a serious story, doesn't it? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ...... ha-ha-ha-ha

<blank>

...... Oh, my apologies. For some reason, reality seems to have started escaping. Agh!

<blank>

<blank>

It will take a month for the main group to be ready. When they are ready, they will contact us again and leave Dekenbel. ......

'Then we need to start preparing for acceptance: ....... What is the size of the contingent?"

Ten ahead of you, twenty in the main body, twenty in the rear.

It's smaller than I thought it would be. ......

"What, you don't expect me to break through Irosio right from the start?"

"...... got it, I'll contact Molly Beers tomorrow. Elrose, please."

Um, I'll take care of it.

<blank>

While I was escaping from reality, the two of them were talking and Elrose was bowing to them.　I was bowing my head to them.

<blank>

I'm not interested in that, Susie. How was the equipment you picked up yesterday? Did you have any problems with it?

Oh, hi. I was so impressed with your very careful hands!"

<blank>

Howard nodded happily, and the topic of conversation turned to the "coming-of-age ceremony" the day after tomorrow.

Are you ready? Are you prepared? Take precautions. Just be careful about what you eat. ...... They advise us to be careful about what we eat.

<blank>

Since the meal was mentioned.

That's the hardest thing for me to think that these family meals ...... Sonia Mama's cooking won't be available for a week.　I would say.

<blank>

'Ala-alah, if I miss you after only a week, what will happen next year when you start going to school in DeKembel?'

<blank>

I heard Mama Sonia say with an annoyed laugh, "I'm sorry, but I can't help it! I dropped the knife and fork I was holding in my hand.

<blank>

Next year?

De Kembel's School ...... boarding school?

Three years of dormitory life?

Can't get Mom's cooking for three years?

You're going away from here for 3 years?

<blank>

Even after all this time, I felt that fact sticking deep in my chest. ......

Impossible! I can't do it!

<blank>

I can't go to the dormitory for three years. ......I don't want to go, I don't want to go. ......I don't want to leave here. I don't want to leave here. ......

<blank>

For some reason, I began to feel sad, and with tears streaming down my cheeks, I pleaded that I didn't want to go anyway.

I'm aware that I'm being extremely selfish, but for some reason I can't stop crying.

<blank>

"Mm-hmm? No, no, no! Suzy! You don't have to go. Mm-hmm! You don't have to go! You don't have to go! Stay here! Mm-hmm! Yes, stay here forever!

<blank>

Howard Papa stood up as if in a panic and said something like that in a quick voice.

<blank>

Howard? Howard, what are you talking about? That's not how it works, is it? And Suzy, you know? It's not immediate. Let's just calm down, okay? Stop crying, sweetie.

<blank>

Sonia-mama stood up and put a handkerchief on my tears.

<blank>

<blank>

As I was eating and having my tears wiped away, I began to remember the first time I had a meal here, and the tears started to flow even more.

<blank>

Howard Dad paces back and forth around the table as if in a panic.

<blank>

Sonia Mama speaks gently to me as she wipes away my tears, "Stop crying.

<blank>

Elrose gently places a napkin on her lap as if she is trying to help.

<blank>

When I feel the kindness of the three people who notice me, I cry even more.

I can't stop crying any longer no matter how I try.

Time just passed without me being able to stop myself from crying like an eggling child.
