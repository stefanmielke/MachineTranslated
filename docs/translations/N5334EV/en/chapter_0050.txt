# Episode 45: The Cloud Family's Dinner

"Nice to meet you, young lady. I am Magritte Gauché, the leader of the advance unit of the 12th Mobile Heavy Knight Brigade."

"Likewise, I am Jimon Reitzman. Pleased to make your acquaintance."

"I am Lysa Ulunova. Young lady!"

<b>

That day, when I returned home from school, I was introduced by Papa Howard to two women and one man. One by one, I shook hands with these guests from the knight brigade.

<b>

<b>

When I think of a knight brigade, I imagine them clad in full plate armor, but that wasn't the case. The attire of these individuals consisted of short camel-colored jackets that resembled a rider's jacket with a broad shoulder silhouette, paired with leather pants.

On their feet were knee-high boots. Well, since they are covered in white plates, I guess they could be called shin guards?

Their gauntlets were... well, they must have taken them off since we were indoors.

They were placed on the sofa where I was sitting.

<b>

Looking at just the gauntlets and shin guards, they do give off a full plate knight vibe.

However, the design feels more modern, resembling rider boots and gloves covered in plates rather than medieval armor.

<b>

If I were to compare, their attire looks like pilot suits from a sci-fi movie.

Or perhaps... those who are exterminating something...?

Well! I can't help but feel that it's "cool," which I think touches on my inner chuunibyou!

<b>

<b>

Magritte is about the same height as Alicia, with dark brunette hair neatly braided and tied up on her head, making her a striking beauty.

The shoulder insignia on her jacket has one more line than the other two, perhaps because she is the unit leader?

<b>

Jimon is a head taller than Magritte.

His short, cropped black hair and deep gray eyes convey a sense of strong will, but his gentle smile hints at a kind personality.

<b>

Lysa is slightly shorter, with beautiful honey-blonde hair that appears red in certain lights, cut around her shoulders, and she has a cute smile.

<b>

<b>

"I apologize for interrupting your conversation."

"Not at all. We were just about to take our leave. It was a stroke of luck to see the rumored princess's lovely face."

"...N-no! I'm not a princess or anything like that..."

"You are indeed a charming princess, just as the rumors say."

"I'll brag to everyone in the unit! I met the princess of Amukamu today!"

"...Huh? ...Whaaaat??"

<b>

W-what does this mean? Why are they calling me a princess?!

I was about to say that I'm not a princess at all when the other two piled on!

Is it because they are knights?! Is there some rule that knights treat girls like princesses?!

Papa Howard, please stop smiling so widely and let this go?!

<b>

<b>

While I was flustered and panicking, the three knights took their leave.

In a daze, I saw them mount their horses and ride away.

However! I quickly came to my senses and turned to Papa Howard...

<b>

"That's terrible! Why didn't you stop them?! I'm not a princess! I was so embarrassed!"

<b>

Feeling my face flush, I protested in a somewhat venting manner, but Papa nodded, saying, "Hmm, they are quite impressive! Hmm, hmm, hmm," as he agreed with himself!

Then Sonia Mama chimed in...

<b>

"See, I've been saying that Suzy is a princess all along, haven't I?"

<b>

And then, they pressed the attack!

With a big smile, they said that, and I couldn’t help but shrink back, going, "H-hiya…!"

<b>

"There's nothing you can do about it, young lady..."

<b>

Elrose explained.

<b>

<b>

The knight brigade is originally an organization based in the central region, that is, the royal capital.

<b>

Although the noble system has been abolished for over 150 years, the trend of valuing the status of nobility still remains strong in the central region.

For them, treating the daughter of a former lord's family as a princess is, in a sense, quite natural...

<b>

What is that? Isn't that a severe anachronism?

Besides, I'm not a noble! I'm a commoner!!

And what is this "rumored princess" nonsense?!

I have no recollection of being gossiped about by strangers!!

<b>

"No, young lady, you have been quite active in Corptown recently..."

<b>

When Elrose said that with a smile, I was left speechless.

<b>

That was not an achievement or anything like that!!

<b>

With such perplexing thoughts in mind, I returned to my room, changed my clothes, and immediately began helping with dinner preparations.

<b>

Tonight, we had decided to cook the "Amukamu Boar" that we had hunted together the other day, so I was in charge of the main meat dish.

<b>

<b>

The Amukamu Boar is not a magical beast like the jackalope but a wild boar that lives in the Amukamu forest.

<b>

Its meat has a somewhat unique flavor, but it is quite popular for its rich umami taste.

<b>

Though it looks similar, it cannot be compared to the magical beast I once ate that resembled something like a god of something!

That taste... 

Ah, no... Just thinking about that flavor makes me want to cry... In a way, it's a trauma.

So, I will overwrite that trauma with the boar's meat!

I will savor it thoroughly, damn it!!

<b>

<b>

The main dishes are pork belly steak and braised shoulder meat in red wine.

<b>

I cut the shoulder meat while learning how to butcher it from Sonia Mama.

<b>

I cut along the shin bone to separate the meat.

As I learned from Mama, I kept removing the meat from the bone.

<b>

How's that? I'm doing well, right? Hehe! How about it? I'm not the same as I used to be! I can properly dismantle meat now!

After all, I have a week of survival living starting the day after tomorrow! Don't think I'm the same as my past self with zero survival skills!! Hehe!

<b>

...I apologize.

For some reason, I got carried away.

I seemed to be overly excited about being able to butcher meat...

<b>

Now that the meat is ready, I quickly move on to cooking.

With Sonia Mama's guidance, I sauté, simmer, and skim the scum as I progress with the cooking.

Using a stove, which I am not accustomed to, requires careful attention to the heat control.

I used to fail often.

I subtly glanced at Sonia Mama and Elrose's expressions.

For now, it seems to be going smoothly.

<b>

After finishing the cooking, I had them taste the braised meat and the onion sauce for the steak.

Sonia Mama and Elrose smiled in response.

Yes! I couldn't help but do a fist pump.

Seeing that, the two of them widened their eyes.

Elrose scolded me, saying, "That's unbecoming," while Sonia Mama laughed heartily.

<b>

<b>

The other dishes were prepared by Sonia Mama and Elrose.

We set the table, and dinner began.

<b>

Papa Howard happily ate the food with a big smile on his face.

Well, I must say, I think I did quite well this time.

Cooking on the stove was really tough at first!

<b>

The meat that had been simmered for a long time was incredibly tender, melting away on the tongue.

<b>

The steak released its umami flavor with each bite, and the onion sauce further enhanced its taste.

Mmm! The deliciousness filled my body with happiness! Overwrite that trauma!!

<b>

<b>

While eating, the conversation turned to the knights who had visited in the evening.

It seems they came as a vanguard to greet Papa Howard.

<b>

"This year's snowmelt was unexpectedly early..."

<b>

Originally, a research team was supposed to be dispatched to the Iroshio Great Forest before last autumn.

However, due to various circumstances, their departure was delayed, and they welcomed winter, pushing their departure to this spring...

<b>

I see.

I see...

The disturbance in Deipara? Did that happen too?

It sounds like quite a serious matter, doesn't it? Ah, ahahaha... ah♪

<b>

...Ah, I apologize. For some reason, it seems I started to escape reality. Oh dear!

<b>

<b>

"It will take a month for the main unit to prepare. Once ready, they will contact us again and depart from Deckenbel..."

"Then we need to start preparing for their arrival... What is the scale of the unit?"

"Advance unit of 10. Main unit of 20. Rear unit of 20, I hear."

"That's smaller than I expected..."

"Well, they probably didn't expect to traverse Iroshio from the start, did they?"

"...Understood. I will contact Molly Beas tomorrow. Elrose, please take care of that."

"Yes, I will leave that to you."

<b>

While I was escaping reality, the two of them continued their discussion, and Elrose bowed her head, saying, "Understood."

<b>

"More importantly, Suzy. How was the equipment you picked up yesterday? Was there any inconvenience?"

"Ah, yes. They took great care in handling it, and I was quite moved!"

<b>

I see, Papa Howard nodded happily, and the conversation shifted to the "Rite of Passage" happening the day after tomorrow.

Is everything prepared? Are you mentally ready? Don't forget to be careful. Just be cautious about eating... The two of them offered advice.

<b>

Since the topic of food came up...

Thinking that I wouldn't be able to eat this family meal... Sonia Mama's cooking for a week is the hardest part. I said that.

<b>

"Oh dear, if you're feeling lonely after just one week, what will happen when you start going to school in Deckenbel next year?"

<b>

Hearing Sonia Mama say that with a chuckle made me gasp! I dropped the knife and fork I was holding.

<b>

Next year?

Deckenbel school... a boarding school?

Three years of living in a dorm?

Three years without Mama's cooking?

Three years away from here?

<b>

Realizing that fact now struck deep in my heart...

No way! No way!

<b>

"I-I can't do it... Three years in a dorm is impossible... I don't want to go, I don't want to... I hate leaving here..."

<b>

For some reason, I felt an overwhelming sadness, and tears began to flow as I desperately pleaded not to go.

I was aware that I was being unreasonable, yet for some reason, I couldn't stop crying.

<b>

"W-what? No, no! Suzy! You don't have to go if you don't want to! Yes! You don't have to go! Stay here! Yes, yes! Just stay here forever!!"

<b>

Papa Howard stood up in a panic and said that quickly.

<b>

"Howard?! What are you saying? That's not how it works, is it? Suzy too, right? It's not happening anytime soon. Calm down, okay? Be a good girl and stop crying?"

<b>

As she said that, Sonia Mama stood up and pressed a handkerchief to my tears.

<b>

<b>

As I was being wiped while eating, I recalled the first time I had a meal here, and it made my tears flow even more.

<b>

Papa Howard hurriedly walked around the table.

<b>

Sonia Mama gently spoke to me while wiping my tears.

<b>

Elrose quietly placed a napkin on my lap, showing her concern.

<b>

Feeling the kindness of the three of them made my tears overflow even more.

I couldn't stop crying no matter what.

Time just passed as I sobbed like a child.
