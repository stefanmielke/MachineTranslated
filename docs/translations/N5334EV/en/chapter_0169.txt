'Tall-kun: ...... Tall-kun! Answer! ...... Thor! Thor! Hey! Please! Answer me!

"It's ............ okay ...... tin. I'm fine, don't worry."

Good! Thor, Thor! Are you hurt? Are you okay to move now?

I'm fine. It wasn't a deep wound. ...... The wound is already closed."

"Are you sure? You're sure you're okay?"

I'm fine, don't worry. The boy is safe.

......Good, that was really good."

I left him with his stepfather and stepmother. You don't have to worry anymore."

I'm talking about you now! I said please don't do anything rash!"

But now the Alconnen family, which has exploited Amkham for so many years, is no more."

Still!

Alconnen is the second largest faction of the aristocracy after Valdemonte. This will make your move a lot easier."

...... that's true though!"

Your shadow warriors were reaching their limits. We had no choice but to do it here in time."

But! So what if something happens to you ......!

I don't care about me. Are you all right, Tin? Are you okay to move your body now?"

I'm fine. I'm fine! I'm fine! You need to take better care of yourself!

"......, as long as you're safe, that's all that matters."

"............ idiot, idiot!"

...... "This time, I screwed up. I was careless. I should have been more careful. ...... Sorry for worrying you."

I'm not going to do it again! Do that right away and ............ really, don't do anything reckless anymore. Please."

"...... yeah. I promise, no more recklessness."

It's true ...... I promise!"

...... someday, someday, I'll take that girl back there."

"............ yeah."

So can I leave the rest to you so you can do that?"

I'm here for that! I'll take care of it!"

All right, I'll leave it to Tin. ......

Yeah, I'm in charge! I'm in charge!"

I'm going to go to ...... and see if I can take a break for a bit." ...... for a little bit."

'Good one Thor. Get some rest. ......"

Someday ...... someday, the three of us will cross that sea together."

Yeah, yeah." Thor! You'll make it across! Someday the three of us will ...... be on that boat."

"...... oh, someday."

"...... yeah, someday."

The main cafeteria is quite busy again today.

Today, which is Saturday in the original world, all students spend the afternoon free.

The students all enjoy chatting over a meal or after-dinner dessert about what they will do in the afternoon.

<blank>

There is a pumpkin fair going on in the diner right now.

The menu includes not only pumpkin dishes, but also a wide variety of sweets made from pumpkin.

<blank>

I chose "pumpkin pudding" today.

The aroma of pumpkin is very rich, and when you put it in your mouth, the gentle sweetness combined with the savory caramel sauce almost spills out.

One bite and you will be filled with happiness, and your face will be full of joy.

<blank>

"Sue, you want to try some of this pie? Here you go.

Kara, it's not fair! Sue-chan, the Koch cake is delicious too! Yes, ahhh!"

No, no, no, Sue wants my bavarois first! Hi, ahhhhh..."

This one is marble cake with chocolate! Here you go, ahhhhh."

<blank>

Carla, Mia, Alicia, and Jessica come in with their spoons out as usual.

I am not a chick waiting to be fed!

<blank>

And yet! There is no way you can refuse the sweets in front of you. ...... The pie, the cake, the bavarois, the mouth receives them all without rejection!

<blank>

「「「「 delicious? 」」」」

It's delicious ......!"

<blank>

And every time I have it, I still put my hand on my cheek and full it.

This is like a reflex that the body reacts to on its own! So it can't be helped!

The beauty of Ikenai is that all of Coco's sweets are excellent!

<blank>

".................."

Can you please stop being so silly? It happens all the time!"

"Haha ......, it's a bit of a surprise when you see it in front of you for the first time ......"

<blank>

Hmm? What are Bibi and Karen saying to Miss Cordelia at the end of the table?

I don't think there's anything particularly unusual about it, do you?

<blank>

At this table now are Mistress Lucille, Mistress Cordilia, Karen, Alicia, and Carla.

And sitting opposite them were Miss Catherine, Bibi, Mia, myself, Jessica, and others.

Dana and Colin are gone now.

<blank>

Dana, as usual, had just finished her meal and left, saying she was going to work out for lunch, and Colin was still not there, saying he had something to do with the student council.

That's why these 10 people are sitting around the table today.

<blank>

And so the spoon attack of sweets was being unleashed one after another from both sides and the front! A-huh!

<blank>

<blank>

Since then, Karen has brightened up as if she had completely changed.

What was she like before? Her shy and unconfident appearance has gone down, and she is smiling carefree around us.

<blank>

When he had a near miss with Miss Lurie and her friends at the school, he didn't seem to be particularly put off at all.

I was watching them with concern, but Miss Lurie and the others seemed to be taken aback by their brazen attitude.

<blank>

Knowing only Karen's reserved nature, I can understand why this change would be confusing.

But this is the real Karen, says Miss Cordelia.

<blank>

Miss Cordilia says happily that she feels like she has finally met Karen.

Miss Cordilia said that she regretted the terrible words she had said to Karen in the past and was looking for an opportunity to make it up to her.

According to Miss Lucille, this was not going well, as her own outburst personality was causing things to spin out of control.

<blank>

Karen also said that she had always wanted to make up with Miss Cordilia.

Karen said that she was still stuck with the fact that she had rejected Miss Cordelia a long time ago and could not look her in the face properly.

<blank>

Seeing them smiling and talking to each other in front of me now, I can't help but feel relieved as someone who has heard of such a situation.

<blank>

I think Bibi also feels something for these girls.

I feel like you are losing your pertinence to Miss Cordelia, don't you?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

But surely this pudding looks good."

Yes, I suppose so.

Cody said, "You should try some, too. Hi, Arn."

I can eat it myself!"

"Ahn."

And so!

"Ahn."

"Oh, mooo......, ahhh......n."

Tasty?"

Oh, it's delicious ......, wow."

I'm glad to hear that! And I'm glad Cody's as cute as ever."

Oh, no, not again! Karen will be saying that soon!"

"...... no, was it?"

"...... no, not ......, it's ......, wow."

Really? That's good!"

Much, much more ......"

<blank>

<blank>

".................."

<blank>

What is it?

Now what have we been shown?

What's with these geeky girls?

What's with this cute little red creature?

"...... tee-hee."

<blank>

The words that came out of my mouth were covered with someone else's.

I glanced in the direction of the voice and saw that I was eye to eye with Miss Catherine.

Thumbs up to each other in silent exchange!

Hmmm! I have a feeling we're going to get along just fine with her!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ladies and gentlemen, we have a lovely guest.

<blank>

At our table, Mr. Selkie, who was in the same class with us, approached us.

A small figure peeks out behind the blue-haired selkie.

It immediately stepped forward and showed off its curtesy beautifully.

<blank>

Ladies and gentlemen, we will see you at noon.

<blank>

There was Annie, curtsying adorably.
