"Tor-kun... Tor-kun! Answer me!... Tor! Tor!! Hey! Please! Respond to me!!"

"........I'm fine... Suzu. It's okay, don't worry."

"That's great!! Tor, Tor! Are you hurt?! You can move now, right?!"

"I'm fine. It wasn't a serious injury... The wound has already closed."

"Really? You're really okay?"

"I'm fine, no need to worry. That child is safe too."

"......I'm glad, really glad."

"I left that child with my stepfather and stepmother. There's no need to worry anymore."

"Right now, it's about you! I told you not to do anything reckless!!"

"But with this, the Alconnen family, which has been exploiting Amukamu for many years, is finished."

"Even so!!"

"Alconnen is a major faction of the nobility, second only to Baldermonte. This will make things much easier for you."

"......That's true, but!"

"Your shadow double was reaching its limit. It was time to act here."

"But! If something happens to you... what will I do!!"

"Don't worry about me. Are you okay, Suzu? Can you move your body now?"

"I'm fine. I'm okay! So! You need to take better care of your own body!!"

"......As long as you're safe, that's enough."

"............You idiot, idiot!"

"......This time, I messed up. I was careless. I should have been more cautious... I'm sorry for worrying you."

"Geez! You always do that... Really, don't do anything reckless anymore. Please."

"......Yeah. I promise, I won't do anything reckless anymore."

"Really... It's a promise!"

"......Someday, someday I'll take that child and come back to you."

"............Yeah."

"So, can I leave the rest to you so that I can do that?"

"Yeah, that's why I'm here! Leave it to me!"

"Got it, I'll leave it to Suzu..."

"Yeah! Leave it to me!"

"......Can I rest a little?......Just a little."

"That's fine, Tor. Take your time to rest..."

"Someday... someday, let's cross that sea together, the three of us."

"Yeah, yeah! Tor! We'll definitely be able to cross! Someday, the three of us... on that ship."

"......Yeah, someday."

"......Yeah, someday."

Today, the dining hall is quite lively.

Today, which corresponds to Saturday in the original world, the students have free time in the afternoon.

The students are all enjoying their meals, chatting about what to do in the afternoon, or having dessert afterward.

<b>

Currently, the dining hall is holding a pumpkin fair.

There are not only pumpkin dishes but also a variety of sweets made with pumpkin on the menu.

<b>

What I chose today is "Pumpkin Pudding."

The aroma of pumpkin is very rich, and when you take a bite, the sweet caramel sauce mixes with it, creating a gentle sweetness that seems to overflow.

With just one bite, happiness spreads throughout my mouth, and I can't help but shake my face in delight.

<b>

"Suu, should we try this pie too? Here, ah~~n."

"Kaara, that's unfair! Su-chan, this cake is delicious too! Here, ah~~n."

"No, no, Suu wants my Bavarian cream first! Here, ah~~n."

"This one is a marble cake with chocolate! Here, ah~~n."

<b>

Kaara, Mia, Alicia, and Jessica are all offering their spoons as usual.

I am not a chick waiting for food!

<b>

Even so! I can't refuse the sweets in front of me... The pie, the cake, the Bavarian cream, my mouth can't help but accept them!

<b>

"Is it delicious?"

"Delicious...!"

<b>

And every time I take a bite, I can't help but shake my cheeks with my hands.

This is like a reflex that my body responds to on its own! So there's no helping it!

The sweets here are all so exquisite, it's just too much!

<b>

"............"

"Can you not be so amazed? It's the usual thing!"

"Ahaha... Seeing it for the first time right in front of me is a bit surprising..."

<b>

Huh? What's going on with Cordelia at the edge of the table? Bibi and Karen seem to be saying something to her?

I don't think anything unusual is happening, though?

<b>

At this table, there are Lucille, Cordelia, Karen, Alicia, and Kaara.

And across from them are Catherine, Bibi, Mia, me, and Jessica.

Dana and Colin are not here right now.

<b>

Dana, as usual, quickly finished her meal and said she was going out for afternoon training, and Colin is also absent due to student council duties.

So today, it's just the ten of us around the table.

<b>

With that, the spoon assault of sweets is coming from both sides and straight ahead! Ah, fun!

<b>

<b>

Since then, Karen has completely changed and become cheerful.

I want to say, what was she like before? Her previous timid and insecure demeanor has vanished, and she now spreads a carefree smile around her.

<b>

When she had a near miss with RuuRii and the others at school, she showed no signs of being intimidated at all.

I was nervously watching, but her confident attitude seemed to surprise even RuuRii and the others.

<b>

If you only knew the reserved Karen, it's understandable to be confused by this change.

However, Cordelia says this is the real Karen.

<b>

Cordelia seems happy to finally feel like she has met the real Karen.

Cordelia regrets having said terrible things to Karen in the past and has been looking for a chance to make amends.

It seems that her own overly impulsive personality had caused things to go awry, according to Lucille.

<b>

Karen also said she had always wanted to make up with Cordelia.

Karen had been troubled by having rejected Cordelia in the past and couldn't look her in the eye.

<b>

Seeing those two now, smiling and talking to each other, I can't help but feel warm inside knowing their circumstances.

<b>

I think Bibi feels something similar about them.

It seems like the intensity of her attitude towards Cordelia has lessened.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"But this pudding really does look delicious."

"Y-yes, it does."

"Cordy, you should try it too. Here, ah."

"I-I can eat it myself!"

"Ah."

"S-so!"

"Ah."

"Geez... ah... mmm."

"Is it delicious?"

"Y-yes, it's delicious..."

"Great! I'm so happy that Cordy is still as cute as ever."

"Y-you again! Karen, you always say that so quickly!"

"......Was that bad?"

"......It's not bad,...... at all."

"Really?! That's great!"

"Geez..."

<b>

<b>

"............"

<b>

What is this?

What are we being shown right now?

What is this beautiful girl?

What is this cute creature turning red?

"......so cute."

<b>

The words that slipped out were echoed by someone else.

When I glanced at the source of the voice, I met Catherine's gaze.

We exchanged silent thumbs-ups!

Hmm! I feel like I can get along well with her!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Everyone, we have a lovely guest here."

<b>

At our table, Selkie from the same class called out to us.

Behind the blue-haired Selkie, a small figure peeked out.

That figure quickly stepped forward and elegantly performed a curtsy.

<b>

"Everyone, I apologize for interrupting your lunch."

<b>

There stood Annie, cutely bowing.
