# Episode 171: Brawl at the Tavern

……I wonder what this is all about.

I can't help but think, is there really anyone who would fall for such an obvious trick? But according to Bibi and Mr. Rudori, the low-level thugs in this town are all short-sighted, so there's no problem.

Hmm, is that really how it is?

<b>

Feeling a bit embarrassed by the farce I just enacted, I cut the meat pie on the table into bite-sized pieces.

As I delicately bring one to my mouth, suddenly Algernon jumps up onto the table.

<b>

And while saying "Kyukyu," he starts urging Bibi to share some food.

<b>

I wonder if he went exploring somewhere around here?

Bibi takes out a handkerchief, dampens it a bit, and wipes Algernon's slightly dirty white fur.

Well, this tavern and the surrounding area can't be described as clean, to say the least.

If he slipped into a little crevice, it's no surprise he'd get dirty in no time.

<b>

Seeing the small animal stretch its back happily while being wiped by Bibi, Ms. Sareina picks up a nut from the plate of snacks she brought and gently offers it to Algernon.

Algernon looks at it, tilts his head slightly, and with a "Kikyu," takes the nut with his tiny front paws and starts nibbling on it right there.

<b>

"Well, well! Well!!"

<b>

Seeing Algernon, Ms. Sareina's face melts with delight as she exclaims.

<b>

Algernon then chirps something like "Kyukukyuu" as if talking to Bibi, who is still wiping him down.

Seeing this, even Ms. Namiena's face starts to soften.

<b>

As always, he's a small animal that women adore.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey there, buddy! Living the good life, huh?! Hey!"

<b>

A rude and boorish voice suddenly shatters the peaceful atmosphere, carelessly thrown toward our table.

<b>

"Can you handle it all by yourself, buddy?"

"How about we take one or two off your hands? Huh?!"

"It doesn't even have to be all of them, you know? Gahaha!"

<b>

As expected, some thug-like men started to bother Mr. Roderick.

It was as if they were saying, "We've been waiting for this!" with all their eyes quietly shining.

<b>

<b>

"You understand, right? Su! You absolutely must not get involved! Got it?!"

"Y-Yes, I understand!"

<b>

I nod in response to Bibi, who whispers a warning in my ear.

I noticed one of the men standing next to Mia, casting a lewd gaze in her direction.

That's why Bibi was trying to restrain me, but of course, I know better. Yes! I know!

<b>

"Hey, you! Who do you think you're trying to lay your hands on my girl without asking?"

<b>

Mr. Rudori stands up from his chair with a "Gatari!" and drops a heavy voice on the guy who was reaching out to Mia inappropriately.

The man freezes for a moment, startled by the voice, but another guy steps forward, closing the distance to Mr. Rudori.

<b>

With a dirty face covered in stubble, he smirks and tries to intimidate Mr. Rudori.

Despite being a head taller than Mr. Rudori, he has some guts.

Right in front of him, the tip of Mr. Rudori's fearsome chest armor is almost at zero distance!

<b>

The man grins lewdly, showing his yellow teeth.

<b>

"I wouldn't mind if you wanted to take me on, you know? Huh? Hey."

<b>

He brazenly tries to grab Mr. Rudori's overwhelming mass right in front of him!

<b>

Ah, this guy is done for...

<b>

We watch the scene, feeling a sharp tension in the air.

I could almost hear the sound of Mr. Rudori's mouth muscles tightening.

But in reality, there he is, grinning like a ferocious predator.

The fangs glistening in his mouth look truly ominous and terrifying.

<b>

"You were the one who threw the first punch, remember?"

"What?!"

<b>

Without any action, Mr. Rudori grabs the man's face effortlessly.

Holding the man's head, Mr. Rudori lifts him up close to the ceiling!

Wow! His hands are huge! His arms are long! Just as expected from a half-giant!

<b>

Still holding the man's head, Mr. Rudori throws him toward the other thugs who are frozen in place without any hesitation!

<b>

"Ugh!"

"Whoa!"

"What the?!"

"You! You bastard!!"

<b>

Whoa! Is he okay? Did his neck not snap off?

Well, I wouldn't really care if it did.

<b>

For now, the men who approached us were a group of four.

Mr. Rudori threw one of them toward the remaining three.

<b>

But only two of them took the direct hit.

The last one, shouting angrily, stepped forward toward Mr. Rudori.

But at that moment, Ms. Sareina grabbed the staff she had leaned against her chair.

<b>

It was her magical medium. A long staff that was about her height.

She lightly tapped it on the floor and instantly called out the name of the spell.

It was the spell "Quick Sleep."

The approaching man fell to the floor, defenseless.

<b>

I thought the same when we were dealing with magical beasts on the way here, but Ms. Sareina is indeed a skilled spellcaster.

<b>

The other men who had been knocked down were surprisingly quick to get back up.

One of them immediately lunged at Mr. Rudori, but the reach difference was overwhelming, and he was once again caught by the face before he could even close the distance. He was experiencing the same fate as the first man. Does he have no learning ability?

<b>

Another one tried to circle around to Mr. Rudori. This one was surprisingly agile.

However, Ms. Namiena quickly grabbed the kite shield that had been next to her chair and thrust it forward to strike.

The man hit by the shield flew about 4 to 5 meters away, crashing into a table and scattering the food that had been spread out on it.

He flew away with incredible force, but I wonder? Did Ms. Namiena use the shield bash of the shield class?

<b>

The first man who had been thrown finally stood up and hurled a mug that was on a nearby table at Mr. Rudori.

Not just the mug, but forks, plates, bowls, and everything else on the table were thrown one after another!

Is this a children's fight?!

<b>

He must be hesitating to approach Mr. Rudori after having his face grabbed earlier.

Then he should just run away, but... he doesn't.

<b>

Everything flying toward Mr. Rudori is being swatted away by Ms. Namiena with her shield.

It's almost like a tennis player returning volleys with graceful movements?!

Most of the things being swatted away were aimed at Mr. Roderick.

<b>

Meanwhile, the man who was throwing things like a child was being beaten up by the other customers sitting at that table. Well, that was bound to happen.

<b>

<b>

The second man who had his face caught by Mr. Rudori had somehow gone completely limp.

Ah, he's already lost consciousness. It's no surprise.

His face was completely engulfed in Mr. Rudori's hand, making it impossible for him to breathe.

<b>

But then, someone from behind tries to tackle Mr. Rudori.

They must have thought they could take him down with momentum, but Mr. Rudori doesn't budge at all.

<b>

Oh, another guy is charging in with a tackle!

Ah, he was easily kicked away.

<b>

The kicked man flew away and crashed into the wall, smashing the table underneath it.

<b>

Immediately after kicking, Mr. Rudori brought down a heavy elbow strike onto the back of the man who was clinging to him.

The man who was clinging to him let out a sound like a squashed frog and collapsed to the floor.

Then, as if to add insult to injury, Mr. Rudori threw the man he was holding at the one who had kicked the table.

<b>

Another man, holding a chair, swung it down toward Mr. Rudori.

However, Mr. Rudori lightly swatted it away with his left hand as if swatting a fly, and then thrust his right palm into the man's chest.

With a dull thud, the sound echoed, and the man flew away toward the wall.

<b>

He's unstoppable!

Mr. Rudori is invincible!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

But why is that?

The initial group of thugs was supposed to be four. Yet now, there are only about three or four men surrounding Mr. Rudori.

In addition, there are several others throwing things from the sidelines.

But even when something seems like it will hit him, Mr. Rudori dodges it without looking, and most of it is being swatted away by Ms. Namiena.

Besides swatting things away, Ms. Namiena also occasionally uses her shield bash to knock away anyone trying to charge in.

<b>

Considering the number of people who have been knocked out, it clearly exceeds ten. The number is definitely increasing.

If things go poorly, it might be that half of the people in this tavern are participating in the brawl.

<b>

By the way, those who have been knocked out and are lying around are being restrained by Ms. Sareina using a magic called "Resting."

This is a wood-type magic that binds the opponent with vines, which Mia often uses. I murmured "Amazing" when I saw Ms. Sareina instantly activate the magic. From Mia's perspective, it seems that Ms. Sareina's magical prowess is quite impressive.

<b>

Moreover, as if to add insult to injury, she layers on "Sleep" and even heals any wounds they have.

Despite dealing with worthless opponents, I can't help but be impressed by how thorough her aftercare is.

<b>

<b>

However, the inside of the tavern is in a state of chaotic brawl. It's turning into a bigger commotion than I expected.

<b>

But well? Since it all started with a sexual assault against Mr. Rudori, I guess there’s no real problem, right?!

I wouldn’t mind exterminating these guys, even if I crush them all!

It's truly the execution of justice!

<b>

Just as I was feeling a bit pumped up inside, something serious came flying toward our table.

<b>

It was clearly some kind of knife.

A thrown dagger.

It was flying straight toward Mr. Roderick's neck.

<b>

I flicked one of the nuts I was holding for Algernon with my fingertip.

It hit the flying object in an instant.

The nut itself shattered and disappeared, but the dagger's trajectory changed dramatically.

In the next moment, Ms. Namiena swatted it away with her shield.

Ms. Namiena's reaction speed is impressive.

<b>

"Right rear, about six meters. Behind the pillar."

"Algernon!"

"Kikyu!"

<b>

I quickly conveyed the location of the opponent to Bibi in a small, swift manner.

At the same time, Bibi gives instructions to Algernon.

<b>

Hmm, it seems like we really did get a bite.
