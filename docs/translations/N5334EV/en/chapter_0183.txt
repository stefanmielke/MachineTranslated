# 171 - Brawl Tavern

I guess it's .......

I can't help but wonder if anyone would fall for such a transparent trick. I can't help but wonder, but according to Bibi and Rudri, it's not a problem because the low-level people in this town are all short-sighted.

Hmmm...is that how it's supposed to be?

<blank>

I cut the meat pie on the table into bite-size pieces, feeling embarrassed at the trifecta I had just played out.

And as I was graciously bringing it to my mouth, Algernon suddenly came running up to the table.

<blank>

Then he starts urging Bibi to share his food with him, saying something like, "Cu-cu-cu-cu.

<blank>

Have you been exploring the area somewhere?

Algernon's white fur was a little dingy, and Bibi took out a handkerchief, wet it a little, and wiped his body.

Well, this neighborhood, including this bar, is not a very flattering place.

It's no wonder that if they slip into even the smallest of crevices, they quickly become flimsy and dirty.

<blank>

As Bibi wiped his back and stretched out his back comfortably, Saleina picked up a nut from the plate that had come as a snack and gently held it out in front of Algernon.

Arjanon turned his attention to it, tilted his head slightly, and with a "squeak," received the nut with his little paw and began chomping on it in place.

<blank>

Well, well! Well!"

<blank>

Seeing Algernon, Saleina, who handed him the nuts, shouted with a prodigal look on her face.

<blank>

Bibi wipes her body, and Algernon squeals "Kyu-kyu-kyu" as if he is talking to her.

Seeing this, even Namiena's face was even more prodigal.

<blank>

He's still the same little animal that the ladies love to receive.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Hello, mister! You're in good shape, aren't you? Hey!

<blank>

A rude and rude voice, which ruined such a peaceful space, was unkindly hurled at our table.

<blank>

"Can your husband handle himself?"

"How about we take one or two of them back here? You know what?

"It doesn't matter if we're all here. Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

Sure enough, some thug-like men got involved with Mr. Roderick.

It's exactly what we've been waiting for!" and everyone's eyes silently light up.

<blank>

<blank>

You know what I mean. Sue! You never mess with me! Okay?

I know.

<blank>

Bibi gives me a small reminder in my ear, to which I respond with a small nod.

I was so surprised to see one of the men standing next to Mia and dropping his lowly gaze to it.

I was about to make a move, but of course I knew it. Of course I know that! Of course I know that!

<blank>

"Hey, you. Who are you trying to mess with my kid when you said no?"

<blank>

Mr. Rudry "GATARI!" and gets up from his chair and drops his dusky voice over the top on the guy who was trying to reach Mia in a disgusting way.

The man stops moving for a moment, but another man steps in front of Mr. Rudri.

<blank>

Then he contorts his dirty face, full of stubble, into a thin smile, and cuts his mensch at Mr. Rudri.

He has surprisingly good nerve, even though Mr. Rudri is more than a head taller than him.

In front of the man's eyes, the tip of Mr. Rudri's vicious chest armor is at almost zero distance from him!

<blank>

The man grinned even more disgustedly and raised his mouth, revealing yellow teeth.

<blank>

I don't care if you're the one who has to deal with it. What? Hey."

<blank>

He grabbed the overwhelming mass of Mr. Rudri, who was looming right in front of him, without any hesitation!

<blank>

Oh, this guy's a dick. ......

<blank>

We watched the situation with a sense of tension that stung like a sharp needle.

I thought I heard an auditory hallucination of Mr. Rudri's palsy making a loud, loud noise that reached me.

In reality, however, Mr. Rudri is there with a predator's smile that fishes out his mouth viciously.

The fangs in its mouth, glistening and showing off, are truly horrifying and disastrous.

<blank>

You're the one who started it, remember?

What?

<blank>

Mr. Rudri had grabbed the man in front of him by the face with no action and without feeling any initial movement.

Grabbing the man's head in an eagle grip, Mr. Rudri lifted it all the way to nearly the ceiling!

Amazing! Hands, huge! Arms, so long! That's a half-giant!

<blank>

Grabbing the man by the head, Mr. Rudri threw him without hesitation toward the other thugs who were frozen in place!

<blank>

"Geez!"

Wow!"

What the hell?

You! You son of a bitch!

<blank>

Wow! Are you okay? You didn't lose your neck?

Well, I don't really care if it's a bit of a mess.

<blank>

The men involved in the take were a group of four.

Rudri threw one of them at the remaining three.

<blank>

But only two people took that direct hit.

The remaining one stepped toward Mr. Rudri, yelling.

But then Mr. Saleina picked up a cane that was propped up on his chair.

<blank>

It is the magical medium she uses. It is a long wand as tall as she is.

With it, he lightly knocks on the floor. At the same time, instantly call out the magic name.

It is a 'quick sleep' spell.

The man who came at him was defenseless and flopped down on the floor on the spot.

<blank>

I thought the same thing when we were dealing with the magical beasts on the road, but I knew that Ms. Sareena was a very skilled spellcaster.

<blank>

The other men who had been rolled were on their feet surprisingly quickly.

One of them immediately jumped on Mr. Rudri, but the difference in reach was so overwhelming that the man was grabbed in the face again, far in front of his own line of sight. He was in the same situation as the first guy. Can't he learn?

<blank>

Another one goes toward Mr. Rudri to go around. Is this guy moving surprisingly well?

But for that guy, Namiena quickly picked up the kite shield she had left by her chair, stuck it out and slammed it down.

The man who was hit by the shield flew to the wall about four or five meters away, smashed the table there, and scattered the food spread on it around the area.

It flew away at a great speed, but is it that thing? Did Namiena use a "shield bash" for her shield job?

<blank>

The man who was first thrown off the table finally got up and threw a mug from a nearby table at Mr. Rudri.

Not only mugs, but forks, plates, balls, and anything else on the table were thrown at us one after another!

Kids fighting?

<blank>

I am sure he is hesitant to approach Mr. Rudri because he was grabbed in the face earlier.

Then why don't they just sassily run away, but they don't ...... run away, do they?

<blank>

Namiena-san is knocking down various flying objects with her shield from one side to the other.

Is that a brilliant move, like a tennis player returning a volley?

All of the things we are knocking off are things that were almost reaching Mr. Roderick.

<blank>

Meanwhile, the guy who was throwing stuff around like a kid got taco-knocked over by the other patrons sitting at his table. Well, that's what happens.

<blank>

<blank>

The second man, who had been grabbed by Mr. Rudri by the face, has his whole body flaccid with dalliance for some time.

Oh, man, he's out of it. No wonder.

It is a thing that doesn't look like it can breathe, with its face completely in the palm of your hand.

<blank>

But then someone tackles Mr. Rudri from behind.

I guess he tried to pull me down with his momentum, but our Mr. Rudri didn't seem to be freaked out.

<blank>

Oh, and another guy tackled me with great force!

Oh, he was kicked off easily.

<blank>

The kicked man is blown away, crashing into a wall and even smashing the table beneath it.

<blank>

Immediately after the kick, Mr. Rudri had landed a heavy elbow strike on the back of the man who was holding on to him.

The man who had been holding on leaks a sound like a squashed frog and slumps to the floor.

And as if to add insult to injury, he had a (?) in his hand. I threw the guy at the guy who kicked him and crushed the table.

<blank>

Furthermore, a man with a chair swung it over his head and brought it down on Mr. Rudri.

But Mr. Rudri lightly brushes it off with his left hand, as if chasing a small insect, and then continues by thrusting the bottom of his right palm into the man's chest.

A dull thud echoed around the area! The man was blown away by the wall with a dull thud.

<blank>

Muso already!

Mr. Rudri Warriors!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

But why?

The first thugs who came to me were a group of four, I believe. But now there are three or four of them surrounding Mr. Rudri.

Besides that, there are a couple of guys throwing something at me from around.

But even when something is about to hit me, Rudri-san is no-look, and he's ducking, and Namiena-san is usually knocking it off.

In addition to knocking things off, Namiena also uses her shield to shield bash the occasional guy who runs into her with it.

<blank>

If you include those who are knocked out like that, the number is not just 10. Clearly, the number is increasing.

If I'm not mistaken, about half of the people in this bar are involved in the brawl.

<blank>

In case you're wondering, the guys who are knocked out and rolling around are being restrained by a magic called "restringing" by Ms. Salaina.

This is a 'wood attribute' magic that restrains the opponent with ivy, which Mia also uses often. Seeing Ms. Saleina instantly activate the magic, she muttered to herself, "Wow. From Mia's point of view, I guess that Ms. Saleina's magic ability is still quite good.

<blank>

And to top it all off, he even put a "sleep" on her and healed her wounds.

I was impressed by the thoroughness of his aftercare, even though he was dealing with a rogue.

<blank>

<blank>

Shucks, the store is in a top-to-bottom brawl. It's a bigger mess than I thought it would be.

<blank>

But what? Since the sexual misconduct against Mr. Rudri is the origin of this project, I don't see any problem with it!

I don't care if we exterminate them or crush them all!

It's really the execution of justice, isn't it?

<blank>

Just as I was getting a little bit excited, something unfashionable came flying at our table.

<blank>

That is a knife of sorts, no matter how you look at it.

Slow-indager.

It was flying straight for Roderick's neck.

<blank>

I popped one of the nuts in my hand with my fingertips to give to Algernon.

It hits the flying object in an instant.

The nut itself popped and disappeared, but the dagger changed its trajectory dramatically.

Furthermore, the next moment the dagger changed its trajectory, Namiena-san knocked it down with her shield.

Namiena's reaction time is also quintessential.

<blank>

Right rear, about 6 meters. Behind a pillar.

Algernon!"

Kikkuk!"

<blank>

I tell Bibi the location of the person to whom I released a small, quick shot.

At the same time, Bibi gives instructions to Algernon.

<blank>

Hom-hom-hom, looks like you really caught on.
