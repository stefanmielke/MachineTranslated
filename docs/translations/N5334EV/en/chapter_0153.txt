# Chapter 141: Each Night, Part 1 (In the Case of Philip Cloud)

"I hate you, Father!!"

"A-Annie?!"

<b>

With a strong retort, Annie rushed out of the room.

Philip watched her leave, his expression frozen in shock.

He then stumbled and collapsed onto a nearby sofa, sinking into it weakly.

<b>

He had braced himself for some rebellion, but he never expected that being directly told "I hate you" would hit him so hard.

<b>

"Listen, Philip. That's unacceptable. I can't see any way to win. Even surrounded by a horde of monsters in the depths of Iroshio, it wouldn't feel as hopeless as this. If you are a father with a daughter, you will eventually face this. Make sure you are prepared so that it doesn't become a fatal blow when it hits you unexpectedly."

He remembered his brother talking about this at a drinking party, but he never thought he would experience something like that himself...

<b>

Summoning the remaining strength he had, Philip pressed his arms against the edge of the sofa and finally managed to stand up.

From there, he made his way to the study's cabinet with unsteady steps. Normally, it would take him less than two steps to cover that distance, but today it felt so far away.

He retrieved the special malt whiskey he had stored inside.

<b>

He broke the seal on the bottle, and with a little effort, pulled out the cork, releasing a pleasant sound as the rich aroma of malt wafted out.

As he tilted the bottle into the crystal glass he had taken out, the amber liquid filled the glass with a rhythmic sound as it met the air.

Normally, he would savor that aroma and enjoy it slowly, but Philip gulped it down all at once.

<b>

I can't hold back any longer...

<b>

He tossed his jacket onto the sofa, unbuttoned the collar of his shirt, and tilted the glass two or three times, but that wouldn't lift his spirits.

<b>

Unknowingly, a deep sigh escaped him.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After receiving a report from Irvin during the day, he immediately sent the guards he had prepared to the facility.

Although nothing serious had happened, he felt a slight chill run down his back when he heard that Annie had engaged in combat afterward.

<b>

If she had grown up in Amukam from the beginning, perhaps it would be dismissed as "just this much." But no, he distinctly remembered how shaken his brother was when he heard that Ravi, at the same age as Annie now, had faced an orc.

<b>

However, Ravi's opponent at that time was a sick orc from Iroshio.

It was different from the thugs of Anatris. Moreover, it was said that Ravi had successfully repelled them... He recalled that the child had always been extraordinary.

<b>

No, no, this is about Annie.

<b>

<b>

Thanks to the somewhat suspicious situation in that country, the surrounding areas have begun to feel the effects. There's no doubt that this is a good opportunity. However, he couldn't bear to place his daughter in the midst of such turmoil any longer.

<b>

Even if he told Annie, "Your work is done," she would obviously not accept it. She would argue, "The work is not finished yet," and "I can't just give up halfway."

<b>

He had anticipated her rebellion, but he realized that his words had been insufficient.

He was also aware that his tone had become harsher.

Another deep sigh escaped him.

<b>

"Dear, even though it's after a meal, aren't you drinking a bit too much?"

"It's a matter of feelings."

"Please drink in moderation."

"I know... I know, but..."

"You really are hopeless."

<b>

Liliana, who had come to check on her husband, sighed in exasperation.

She then sat down next to him and said, "Since there's no helping it, I'll accompany you for a little while," prompting Philip to stand up happily to grab another glass.

<b>

However, at that moment, a quiet knock sounded at the door. From beyond the door, the house steward announced that urgent business had arrived.

If he allowed entry, the elderly steward would approach Philip with quiet steps and open his mouth.

<b>

"Sir, I have news from the Bear Trading Company."

"From Colette?"

"And also a report from the Bairos family."

"What happened?!"

<b>

Philip quickly gathered his thoughts and received the note the steward had brought, scanning it swiftly.

But immediately, his eyes widened in shock.

<b>

"Dear? What happened?"

"She did it! She really did it!!"

"She...?"

"It's Suzy! Haha! That girl has done something incredible!"

<b>

Philip, overwhelmed with emotion, slapped his palm against his forehead.

<b>

"She crushed all their bases, incapacitated almost all the soldiers, and even freed the hidden vault!"

<b>

That child had not yet conveyed that she had been preparing and watching for an opportunity against that gang of thugs.

What they had been trying to do for years, she accomplished in just one night.

<b>

"Isn't it a mockery of us who have been preparing for so long?!"

"You seem quite pleased."

"Haha! The schemes of clever people can be overturned in just one night! This is truly the embodiment of Amukam itself! How can I not laugh?!"

<b>

Philip couldn't hold back his laughter.

<b>

In Amukam, he had seen that child sparring with his brother many times. He had also sparred with her numerous times.

He fully understood that she was extraordinary beyond measure. He thought he understood Suzy's abilities.

<b>

But how could she pull off something so outrageous in such a short time without any information?!

<b>

His brother had repeatedly bowed his head, saying, "I think it will be troublesome, but please take care of it. Almost certainly, she will do something. I apologize for the inconvenience, but please take care of it." He had also mentioned, "I have assigned the daughters of the Kuroki and Matisson families as watchers, but when she does something, she really does it, so just be prepared."

<b>

What on earth! Even though she must have done something outrageous, why is my heart racing so much?!

<b>

"But this will significantly shorten our schedule! We can't miss this opportunity! Send a messenger to Chief Goldberg! I will request the deployment of the guards in Dekkenbel! Have them set up a siege by morning!"

<b>

Philip issued instructions to the steward, took his discarded jacket, and slipped it on.

<b>

"I will be going to Colette's place now. She must be in a panic by now."

"Then I will head to the Dekkenbel Defense Headquarters. I will convey the message to Lord Robert Randall Goldberg myself."

"Can I count on you?"

"Fufu! I am also very excited right now!"

"Haha! So am I! Now! Letâ€™s prepare for the festival!"

<b>

Even though night was beginning to fall, the lively voices of Philip and the others echoed throughout the Cloud residence.

<b>

It was just after Annie had cried herself to sleep, unable to digest her anger towards her father.
