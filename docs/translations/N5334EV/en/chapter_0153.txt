# 141 Episode 141: Those Nights, Part 1 (The Case of Philip Cloud)

I hate your father! I hate you!

Annie?

<blank>

Annie leaves a strong, discarded line and rushes out of the room with great vigor.

Philip looked away from it, a stunned expression clinging to his face.

He staggered and collapsed onto a nearby sofa, sinking into it helplessly.

<blank>

I was prepared for some rebellion, but I had never thought that being directly confronted with the word "hate" would be so heartbreaking.

<blank>

I'm not going to do that. I don't like it. I don't see any way to win. There's no feeling of hopelessness like being surrounded by a pack of monsters in the depths of Irosio. If you are a father of a daughter, you will probably encounter them at some point. Just be prepared so that you don't get hit unexpectedly with a fatal blow.

I remember hearing my brother talk about it before when we were drinking and just laughing about it, but I never thought I would have to go through it myself. ......

<blank>

Philippe finally stands up, straining his arms around the edge of the sofa as if to gather his remaining strength.

And from there, I reached the cabinet in the study with weak footsteps. Normally, it would have taken me less than two steps to get there, but today, it seemed so far away.

He then took out a bottle of his favorite malt whisky, which he had stored inside.

<blank>

When the bottle is unsealed and the stopper is pulled out with a slight effort, the mellow aroma of malt leaks out with a pleasant sound.

Tipping the bottle into the crystal glass that accompanied it, the amber liquid filled the glass with a rhythmic sound as it hit the air.

Normally, one would savor the aroma and savor it leisurely, but Philippe poured it down his throat in one gulp.

<blank>

I can't do without drinking this. ......

<blank>

I took off my jacket on the sofa, unbuttoned the collar of my shirt, and sipped my glass two or three times, but this was not going to make me feel better.

<blank>

A deep sigh escapes me.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After receiving Irvin's report at noon, he immediately sent the guards he had prepared to the facility.

Even though it turned out all right, when I heard that Annie had done battle afterwards, I felt a bit of a chill run down my back.

<blank>

If the child had been raised in Amcam from the beginning, he might have been told 'this is about as good as it gets'. ...... No, as I recall, when Ravi was the same age as Annie is now, his brother was very upset when he heard that he had confronted the orcs.

<blank>

But then Lavie's opponent was a sick oak in Irosio.

This is not the same as the rag-tag of Anatolis. Moreover, Ravi even successfully fought them off, ...... says. I remember that girl was always substandard too.

<blank>

No, no, now it's about Annie.

<blank>

<blank>

Thanks to the slight tampering in the country in question, the surrounding area is beginning to be affected as well. There is no doubt that this is an opportunity. But I am not willing to put my daughter in the middle of any more rough spots.

<blank>

When I told Annie that the job was finished, she naturally did not agree. She argues, "The job is not finished yet," and "I can't just throw it away in the middle of the job.

<blank>

Naturally, I expected defiance, but my words were not enough.

I am also aware that the way I say things has become stronger.

A loud sigh escaped from the overlapping sighs.

<blank>

"You've had a little too much to drink, even after dinner, haven't you?"

It's all about feelings."

Do not be too hard on yourself, sir.

'I know, I know. ....... I know, I know."

You're a pain in the ass.

<blank>

Liliana, who had come to check on her husband, sighed in disgust.

Then he sat down next to her husband and told him, "I have no choice, so let's have a little company," and Philip happily got up to get another glass.

<blank>

But then there was a quiet knocking on the door. From the other side of the door, the house orderly of the mansion announced that an urgent matter had arrived.

Allowing him to enter, the elderly family orderly steps quietly to Philip's front door and opens his mouth.

<blank>

Sir, I have news from the Bear Trading Company.

From Colette?"

And I have more news from the Byros family.

What happened?

<blank>

Philip instantly regained his awareness, received the note that the family orderly had brought, and quickly read it over.

But immediately his eyes widen as much as they can.

<blank>

"Hello? What's wrong?"

He did it! He did it, that boy!"

Is she ......?"

It's Suzy! Ha! That girl got me!"

<blank>

Philip struck his forehead with the palm of his hand as if moved to tears.

<blank>

They have destroyed all their strongholds, crippled most of their soldiers, and liberated their hidden vaults!

<blank>

The boy has not yet told that he was preparing for an opportunity against that group of fools.

We did in just one night what we have been trying to do for the last several years and could not do.

<blank>

It's as if you're mocking us for taking the time to prepare!"

You look kind of happy."

Haha! The schemes of the wily are overturned in just one night! This is the true manifestation of Amukam itself! How can you not laugh at this?

<blank>

Philip lets out an unbearable laugh.

<blank>

I have seen that boy many times on amcam where he is holding hands with his brother. I have also joined hands with him many times.

I know full well that the girl is substandard, substandard, substandard. I think I understand what Suzy is capable of.

<blank>

But, how could he do such a crazy thing in such a short period of time when he has no information?

<blank>

My brother also said to me, "I know I'm going to put you through a lot of trouble, but please take care of me. I am almost certain that I will do something wrong. I know I will cause you trouble, but please take care of me. He also said, "I have assigned the daughters of the Kuroki and Mathisons as attendants, but please just be prepared because if they make a mistake, they will make a mistake.

<blank>

Totally! I wonder why my heart is beating so fast, even though he must have done something terrible!

<blank>

But this will greatly shorten my schedule! We can't let this opportunity pass us by! Send a messenger to Director Goldberg! I want all the guards in De Kembel mobilized! Have the siege up and running by morning!"

<blank>

Philip sends instructions to the house orderly, then grabs his own jacket, which he had just taken off, and puts the sleeves on it.

<blank>

I'm going to Colette's now. She's probably in a panic right now.

I will go to the headquarters of the De Kembel Area Defense Organization. I will inform Mr. Robert Randall Goldberg.

Can you do that for me?"

I'm very excited about it, too, you know? I'm really excited about this too, you know?"

Haha! Me too! Come on! Let's launch the festivities!"

<blank>

Even though it was beginning to get late at night, Philip and his friends' energetic voices echoed inside the Cloud mansion.

<blank>

It was not long after Annie had fallen asleep, exhausted from crying, unable to digest her anger at her father.
