# 148 High Backdoor.

Fluke doesn't quite remember how he got to that room.

My memory is terribly fuzzy from the middle of the trip.

I also thought that maybe it was all a dream from the beginning.

<blank>

However, the pain that continually assaults his entire body reminds him that this is not a dream.

Why hasn't he died yet after all this pain? I even wish they would just kill me right away.

<blank>

All I can recall is that woman's horrifying face.

<blank>

With a face that looks fake, he looks at me with emotionless eyes.

The emerald green eyes seemed to be connected to some unimaginably deep place, and just staring into them made me feel as if I were being dropped somewhere extraordinary. It was the first time I had ever seen eyes that were so stunningly beautiful and yet so terrifying.

<blank>

<blank>

---- He looked me in the face and said clearly, "The next time you show your face, your life is not guaranteed." --...

<blank>

Fluke was shaken to his core at that moment.

I felt awe from the depths of my soul.

<blank>

And I have little memory beyond that.

<blank>

After that, I think I was surrounded by a number of men.

I wonder if those were the guys from the receiving group.

He seemed to be ranting about something and kicking at Fluke, but by then he had lost most of his senses and was immediately disoriented.

<blank>

I thought I heard them scream.

I thought I saw something like a white shadow.

But I couldn't understand it well because I could hardly see things.

<blank>

Either way, the next thing I knew, I was in a windowless office.

Then, after being forced to drink something, I was approached.

<blank>

Hey, are you conscious?

<blank>

After the trolley had gone down my throat, I no longer felt pain anywhere in my body that had been flailing around in such intense pain.

On the contrary, it is as if power is flooding through my body.

<blank>

I don't feel any pain anywhere. ...... What's going on?

I'm glad to hear that," he said. After all, it's specially made."

Is it a special ......?"

It's not some cheap, flimsy thing. It's a genuine, specially-made ascending medicine. It heals injuries in an instant!"

I'm sure that the injury is not so bad anymore. ...... Besides, the feeling of power coming up is amazing!

<blank>

The power that welled up from his body was unusual.

The more time passes, the more my mood goes up.

The sense of omnipotence that filled his entire body made him believe that he could do anything now.

<blank>

I can be sure that the knight-apprentice kid who mocked me during the day can be easily crushed now.

Just imagining beating him with my own hands fills my head with violent joy, and the corners of my mouth naturally hang open.

<blank>

I said, "You seem to be in good shape. This seems to be all right."

Yes! Thanks to you!"

Then you've got some work to do."

Please say whatever you want! I can do anything now!"

I knew you would say that."

<blank>

This is Steerpike's office.

It was already close to dawn, just before the sky began to turn white, but no sign of the outside could be felt in this windowless room.

<blank>

As Fluke sat on the floor and repeatedly reasserted his grip on his own hand, Steerpike kneeled down, placed a hand on his shoulder, and spoke kindly to him.

<blank>

Steerpike, who looks terrifying, speaks quietly with a soft expression on his face.

It is as if he is trying to exude more kindness than necessary, and those who know him well can even feel a chill of discomfort.

<blank>

You know that girl you've been messing around with lately?"

To ......? Yes."

"I'm pretty sure it was ......, Calle ...... what was it?"

Ka, is this Karen Merlin ......?"

'Yes, it's Marlin! It's Marlin! It's him, I know it.

<blank>

Steerpike slaps his knee, "That's him.

Fluke does not understand why Steerpike cares about Karen.

But, as far as I was concerned, I understood that it was a prelude to something worse.

<blank>

I want you to bring me the red stone he's wearing.

...... stone, is it?"

Yes," he said. Like this, you're wearing it on your chest ......? Yes, yes."

Ha, ha."

<blank>

Steerpike turns his gaze away from Fluke, as if he were confirming what someone was saying, and then goes on to spin his words.

Fluke realizes this and looks around for a moment to see if there are only two people in the room, but they are the only two people in the room.

<blank>

You take the stone, and my daughter is yours to do with as you please."

Yes!

We will give them plenty of medicine. I'll also give you some of our dogs. Use them well.

Is it Inu......?"

Yes, it's a "dog. Ask downstairs how to handle it. Oh, and as for your men, most of them have been taken away and so far we haven't been able to collect them. Sorry about that.

"............"

<blank>

"But I was able to retrieve one of them in the basement of your office. "But I was able to retrieve one of them in the basement of your office," he said, "and he was less sick than the others. I used drugs on him, so take him with you and use them."

"......, yes."

No, it's not hard to do. We're going to kidnap the girl and retrieve the stone. That's it. It's easy, isn't it?

Yes. ......."

<blank>

You say, "Well, ...... it's noon. It'll be fine until noon. Bring it here."

<blank>

Fluke looks up from below at Steerpike, who cuts off his words.

The air felt slightly tense.

<blank>

If you can't do that, go to ......."

<blank>

Fluke felt a chilling light in Steerpike's eyes. At the same time, he heard his own throat gulp.

<blank>

It's fish food for the mag-arat."

<blank>

Fluke feels as if every pore in his body is opening as Steerpike coldly tells him off.

<blank>

There were definitely their absolutes in the country.

There is no way they would be allowed to disobey.

It instantly reminds me of the kind of person Steerpike is.

<blank>

Oh, leave it to us! I promise you, I will bring you exactly what you want!"

<blank>

Fluke instantly straightened up, his back straightening and his voice rising from the pit of his stomach.

<blank>

I knew you would say that."

Ha!"

<blank>

Steerpike's mouth parted for a moment as he said this, but he immediately dropped a cold stare at Fluke.

<blank>

Go."

Ha!

<blank>

Fluke left that office without a sideways glance at Steerpike's quiet order.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, dear, in such a hurry."

<blank>

At the same time as Fluke hurriedly closes the door, a shadow in the corner of the room begins to shimmer and take human form.

<blank>

Are you sure? We're getting rid of this place, aren't we? Not that the boy will be back and there will be no one there?"

If I can get back. He will pay for himself. The stones are just a matter of time. Either way, I'm leaving him with a watchman and a liaison."

I see."

<blank>

A shadow in the shape of a person laughs.

<blank>

We're done here anyway. It's not a bad time to pull out."

So you left this behind? You're a terrible person."

You're going to check that thing anyway, aren't you?"

I'm sure you're right, we do need to collect. I thank you. Thank you for the good samples.

I'm just going to use it to get some stuff done."

<blank>

Steerpike placed a finger on the chin of the leaning brown woman, lifted it, and turned her beautiful face toward him.

<blank>

It's not bad to have fun with non-humans. I'll see you soon."

"Oh, no. You're a person, aren't you? I forgot."

<blank>

A shadowy brown-skinned woman leans her body against Steerpike, brings her face even closer, and laughs, as if she is enjoying herself.

<blank>

I'm always happy enough, aren't I?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After spending a few moments enjoying and devouring the last remnants, the man leaves the room without saying a word.

<blank>

"Well, I've got a treat for her, too."

<blank>

Lying on the sofa with her skin exposed, the brown woman mutters lazily.

<blank>

Maybe it's time to pull over to our side.

<blank>

Slowly getting up from the couch, the barely clad costume slips off in a fluid motion.

<blank>

The woman carried her slender legs forward, exposing her beautifully even limbs.

<blank>

'Oh ....... But he's going to speed up the sprouting process."

<blank>

He then ran his slender fingers up her body as if he was caressing his own body, and when he pushed his lips apart in annoyance, he intertwined his tongue with the tip of hers.

<blank>

I can't wait to see the flowers you'll make bloom, can you? Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ......"

<blank>

With a thin laugh, the brown woman disappears as if melting into the shadows.

In the empty office, only the echo lingered like a lingering scent.

<blank>

It happened that day in the dawning darkness, just a few moments before dawn.
