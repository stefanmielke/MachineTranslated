# Chapter 148: High Backdoor

Fluke does not remember well how he came to that room.

His memories from the middle are terribly vague.

He even thought that it might all be a dream from the beginning.

<b>

However, the pain that constantly assaults his entire body makes him realize that this is not a dream.

With this much pain, why am I still not dead? He even fleetingly thought that he wished to be killed right away.

<b>

What comes to mind is the terrifying face of that woman.

<b>

With a face that looks artificially perfect, she peers at him with emotionless eyes.

Her emerald green eyes seem to connect to an unfathomably deep place, and just being stared at makes him feel as if he might fall into some unimaginable abyss. He learned for the first time that there are eyes that can be so beautiful yet feel so terrifying.

<b>

<b>

――――She looked into my face and clearly said, "If you show your face again, there will be no guarantee for your life."――――

<b>

At that moment, Fluke was truly shaken.

He felt a fear from the depths of his soul.

<b>

And then, he has almost no memories of what happened next.

<b>

After that, he feels as if he was surrounded by several men.

Were they from the receiving group?

They seemed to be shouting something and kicking Fluke, but by that time, his senses had almost faded, and soon he lost consciousness.

<b>

He thought he heard their screams.

He felt as if he saw something like a white shadow.

However, since he could hardly see anything, he could not be sure.

<b>

In any case, when he next became aware, he was in a windowless office.

And after being forced to drink something, he was spoken to.

<b>

"Hey, are you conscious?"

<b>

After something slippery went down his throat, he no longer felt any pain in his body, which had been writhing in agony.

On the contrary, it felt as if strength was overflowing from his entire body.

<b>

"I... I don't feel any pain... What... what is happening?!"

"That's good to hear. After all, it's a special one."

"Special... you say?"

"It's not some cheap, flimsy thing. It's a genuine special recovery drug. It heals injuries in an instant!"

"Y-Yeah, that injury is already nothing... And I feel an incredible surge of strength!"

<b>

The power surging from his body was extraordinary.

The longer time passed, the better he felt.

The omnipotence surging throughout his body made him think that he could do anything now.

<b>

He was confident that he could easily crush that knight apprentice brat who had humiliated him during the day.

Just imagining smashing him with his own hands filled him with violent joy, and the corners of his mouth naturally curled up.

<b>

"You seem to be in good shape. It looks like there won't be any problems."

"Yes! Thanks to you!"

"Then, I have a job for you."

"Anything you say! I can do anything now!"

"I thought you'd say that."

<b>

This is Stearpike's office.

It was just before dawn, with the sky beginning to lighten, but in this windowless room, there was no sign of the outside.

<b>

Kneeling beside Fluke, who was repeatedly clenching his hands, Stearpike placed a hand on his shoulder and spoke gently.

<b>

Despite his terrifying appearance, Stearpike spoke quietly with a soft expression.

It seemed as if he was trying to exude more kindness than necessary, and anyone who knew him well would feel a chill at that sense of incongruity.

<b>

"Recently, there has been a girl you've been bothering, right?"

"…Huh? Y-Yes."

"Her name was... what was it again?"

"Is it... Karen Merlin?"

"That's right! Merlin! That's definitely her."

<b>

Stearpike clapped his knees and said, "That's her."

Fluke did not understand why Stearpike was concerned about Karen.

However, he understood that it was a prelude to something unpleasant.

<b>

"I want you to bring me the red stone she wears."

"…The stone, you say?"

"Yes. The one she wears on her chest… right? Yes, that's it."

"Y-Yes."

<b>

Stearpike looked away from Fluke, as if confirming something with someone, and began to weave his words.

Noticing this, Fluke quickly scanned the room, realizing that there should only be the two of them, and indeed, it was just the two of them.

<b>

"If you take the stone, you can do whatever you want with the girl."

"Y-Yes!"

"I'll make sure you have plenty of the drug. Also, I'll give you a few of the 'dogs' we keep. Use them well."

"D-Dogs... you say?"

"Yes, 'dogs.' Ask how to handle them downstairs. Oh, and about your subordinates, most of them have been taken, and we haven't been able to recover them yet. Sorry about that."

"…………"

<b>

"However, we managed to recover one person from your office's basement. It seems he was less injured than the others. I used the drug on him too, so take him with you and use him."

"…Y-Yes."

"It's not a difficult task. Just kidnap the girl and retrieve the stone. That's all. Simple, right?"

"Yes…"

<b>

"Well then… it's noon. You have until noon. Bring it here."

<b>

As Stearpike finished speaking, Fluke looked up at him from below.

He felt a slight tension in the air.

<b>

"If you can't do that…"

<b>

Fluke felt a cold light flicker in Stearpike's eyes. At the same time, he heard the sound of his own throat swallowing hard.

<b>

"You'll be fish bait for Maguarat."

<b>

Fluke felt a sensation as if all the pores in his body opened at Stearpike's cold words.

<b>

Without a doubt, the absolute ruler of this country was present there.

There was no way he could defy him.

Fluke instantly recalled what kind of person Stearpike was.

<b>

"Y-Leave it to me! I-I will definitely bring you what you desire!!"

<b>

Fluke straightened his back in an instant and raised his voice from the depths of his belly.

<b>

"I thought you'd say that."

"Yes!"

<b>

With that, Stearpike briefly smiled, but soon turned his cold gaze back to Fluke.

<b>

"Go."

"Yes!!"

<b>

At Stearpike's quietly spoken command, Fluke left the office without looking back.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Oh my, how hurried you are."

<b>

As Fluke hurriedly closed the door, a shadow in the corner of the room swayed and began to take on a human shape.

<b>

"Is it alright? You're leaving this place, right? If that child returns, there will be no one here, will there?"

"If he can return. He will have to pay his own debts. As for the 'stone,' that would be a bonus. In any case, I'll leave behind a watcher and a liaison."

"I see."

<b>

The shadow that had taken on a human form chuckled.

<b>

"Anyway, the tasks here are done. It's not a bad time to withdraw."

"And this parting gift? Hehe, you're terrible."

"You're going to check on that, right?"

"Yes, recovery is necessary. Thank you for the good sample."

"I'm just using it as a side benefit."

<b>

Stearpike placed his finger under the chin of the brown-skinned woman beside him, lifting it to bring her beautiful face closer to him.

<b>

"There's nothing wrong with enjoying oneself with non-humans. Perhaps again, someday."

"Oh? You were human, weren't you? I had forgotten."

<b>

The shadowy brown-skinned woman leaned against Stearpike, bringing her face closer and laughing as if she were having fun.

<b>

"I'm always having plenty of fun, you know?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

After enjoying a moment of lingering pleasure and indulging in time, the man silently left the room.

<b>

"Well then, I should give that child a reward."

<b>

Lying on the sofa in a revealing outfit, the brown-skinned woman murmured lazily.

<b>

"I suppose it's about time to draw them closer."

<b>

Slowly rising from the sofa, the barely-clad garment slipped off her like flowing water.

<b>

The woman moved her slender legs forward, exposing her beautifully proportioned body.

<b>

"Oh… But thanks to him, it seems the budding will come early."

<b>

Then, as if to caress her own body, she ran her slender fingers up and down, parting her lips in a seductive manner, and intertwined her tongue with it.

<b>

"I'm looking forward to the flowers you'll make bloom for me. Hehe, hehehehe, hehehehehehe..."

<b>

With a faint laugh, the brown-skinned woman melted into the shadows and disappeared.

In the now empty office, only the echo of her laughter lingered like a lingering fragrance.

<b>

It was a brief incident that occurred just before dawn on that day, in the twilight of night.
