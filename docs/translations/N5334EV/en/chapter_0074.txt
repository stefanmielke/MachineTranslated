# Chapter 69: The Three Scholars of the North

There are cruel depictions. Please be cautious if you are sensitive to such content.

<b>

"I think you already know that Manulite is an extremely high magic conductivity mineral... The high-purity vein is now spread out right here."

<b>

Morris Balthasar stepped out of the tent, carrying a small backpack on his shoulder, walking forward while pointing around.

<b>

"I've been experimenting for quite some time. Is it not possible to dig up just the desired mineral freely from the ground?"

<b>

Behind Morris, Seiwashi slithered along, and his assistant, Joseline Joslan, was being dragged along as well.

The knights of Cedric's group had followed them, coming up to the outside of the barricade they had set up.

Surrounding them were members of the sturdy team, including Cornell, walking in sync while keeping a lookout.

<b>

"Well, it didn't go as conveniently as I had hoped! ... But still! I was able to influence the target mineral! All that's left is the application of 'Earth Wall'!"

<b>

Morris was muttering things like "No, not quite. A little more." while searching the ground with his hands in various places, about 5 to 6 meters away from the barricade.

At one spot, when Morris exclaimed, "Yes, this is it!", he opened the bag he was carrying and took out a folded small survival shovel-like object.

Holding the thick handle of the shovel and the back handle, Morris pulled it with a grunt, and with a sound of "jakon," the shovel extended longer.

Then, with force, he plunged the sharp tip of the shovel deep into the ground.

<b>

"The cool thing about this is that as long as the target mineral exists, the effect will reach it! I call it 'Earth Awakening.' I brought it just in case something like this would happen! With this, I will build a grand wall!! But well, once the magic runs out, that's the end of it! ... So, Seiwashi, bring it out! You have something saved up, right?"

<b>

When prompted, Seiwashi Melchio raised an eyebrow and received a large round tube-like bag that Joseline was holding, taking out a brass-colored stick about 30 centimeters long.

The stick was connected to other items by a thin chain at one end, and with a rattling sound, several connected pieces were pulled out.

<b>

"Hmm, this is the 'Magic Accumulation Array.' I also brought it just in case something like this would happen. However, it only makes sense in a place like this where the magic pressure and flow are enormous, and it cannot be used unless one is well-versed in magic control like us. It's truly a localized and user-selective item that's incredibly inconvenient. Now, Joseline, are you ready?"

"Eh? M-me?! Am I doing it too?!"

"Hmm, of course! Now let's hurry up with the preparations."

<b>

"Uhyohyo! We can't dawdle around, can we?!"

"Of course not! Nosori, you have something too, right? Come on! Bring it out!!"

"Uhyohyo! Is this it?! The 'Magic Core Repulsion Coating' that I secretly developed just in case something like this would happen?!"

<b>

Prompted by Morris, Nosori Kasubaru rummaged through his lab coat and pulled out something that looked like a potion bottle.

<b>

"It was originally developed to repel the stagnant magic originating from magic-generating creatures! It seems like it could be effective against the undead!!"

<b>

Saying this, he threw the potion bottle toward Cedric.

<b>

"Here, Captain! When the wall rises, throw this bottle! Then, Morris's cheap earthen wall will instantly transform into a high-quality silver wall!!"

"What did you say?! The thin one is your head, Nosori!"

"I didn't say it was thin, did I?! Besides, I wasn't even talking about heads, you know?! It seems Morris has finally become senile up to his ears!"

<b>

"Hmm, both of you, our preparations are complete. Let's get started quickly."

<b>

Seiwashi, along with Joseline, spread out the stick-like items around the spot where Morris was standing, drawing what looked like a half-circle spider web magic circle.

Then, while placing the sticks, Joseline timidly voiced a straightforward question.

<b>

"Um... why is everyone so conveniently prepared with such useful items?"

<b>

At Joseline's words, Nosori, Morris, and Seiwashi all opened their mouths in disbelief, raising their eyebrows and giving her a pointed look.

<b>

"W-what's wrong?! Why are you all looking at me like I'm strange for asking such a thing?!"

"To not understand such an obvious thing... What a foolish girl..."

"Indeed, it's truly lamentable."

"Hmm, Joseline, as your teacher, I find this quite embarrassing."

"W-what?! What do you mean by that?!"

<b>

"That's because it's called 'standard practice.'"

<b>

"I-I don't understand the meaning of that?!"

<b>

<b>

"Hmm, well then, let's stop playing around and get started."

"Y-you were just toying with me?!"

<b>

The spider web-like magic circle created with the sticks spread out in a fan shape around Morris.

At the edge of this web, directly behind Morris, stood Seiwashi on his left, Nosori on his right, and Joseline in between them.

<b>

"Here we go! Are you ready?!"

"Hmm, no problems here. We three will control the magic, so Morris, you just focus on activating the spell."

"A-aah, aahhh!"

"Uhyohyo! Morris, there's no need for silly jokes. Just get on with it! Oh, have you already started to daze out?!"

"Shut up! Nosori! Here we go! This is the roar of the earth!!!"

<b>

Morris gripped the handle of the shovel he had plunged into the ground, channeling magic into the 'Earth Knocker' and unfolding the spell.

At the same time, the ground around the three surrounding Morris began to glow, and the light flowed into the magic circle, gathering towards the center where Morris stood.

<b>

"Hmm, the mechanism of this is quite simple. By intentionally creating a low-pressure area within the high-pressure magic flow of Iroshio, the magic will automatically be drawn in. Since we shape the path of that magic flow with our own magic, we need to concentrate, or else the magic will quickly deplete."

"Aah, aahhh! Aahhhhhh!"

"Hmm, the magic pressure is beyond expectations. We need to adjust the magic conduit while keeping the flow rate in check. If we exceed a certain speed, turbulence will occur, leading to significant losses. If we don't maintain laminar flow, the magic will be rapidly depleted."

"Fuhh, fuhhh! My veins are about to burst!"

"Uhyohyo! This works! My shoulders are feeling lighter by the second!!"

"My veins! My brain's veins are about to burst! It's going to burst! My nose! My nose is bleeding! ... Ubbebobobapipi!!"

"Uhyoo! This girl! Not only is she bleeding from her nose! She's blowing snot everywhere!! I can't bear to look at her face... How pitiful..."

"Bibobii! Bawaiboboka, Zubii, buppababay, obotte! Zubii, bibiyabuzeni! Zzubizubiyu!"

"How disgusting! Blow your nose, will you?!"

"Uuuh, zubibiiiiiim, zubiiim! Zubii! I can't get married like this! Sniff sniff sniff!"

"...... So, you still intend to go on, huh... I'm surprised."

"Hmm, truly a surprising coming out."

"That's too cruel! The teachers are too much!!"

<b>

"Uhohoho! Here it comes! It's boiling! It's boiling!! It's boiling over!!!"

<b>

Cracks began to run across the ground, spreading out from the shovel that was plunged into the earth, and faint light leaked out from the gaps formed in the ground.

<b>

"Awaken! Awaken! Stand up quickly!!!"

<b>

Morris turned the grip he was holding 90 degrees, pushing it down with all his might towards the thick cylindrical shaft.

At that moment, the light overflowing from the cracks shone brightly.

<b>

"That's it! Hahaha!!"

"Ho, Morris is getting into it."

"Hmm, it's rare to see him so pumped up."

"Wadajibaa, zoredogoro debaa, abibazeen! Adamaga adamaga waderuu!!!"

<b>

Morris increased the speed at which he pushed the handle down, as if pumping air into it.

In response, the light overflowing from the earth also grew larger.

The cracks widened and split further, and the ground began to bulge up due to the magic being pumped into it.

<b>

"Go! Let's go!!!"

<b>

With a thunderous roar echoing around, a black rock wall burst through the surface with great force.

<b>

The black wall, forming a circle with Morris at the peak, flung away the few undead nearby, pushed up trees, knocked them down, and spread out like a fan towards the 'Black Rock' far ahead.

It was rapidly being constructed to encircle the grotesque mass writhing in front of the 'Black Rock.'

<b>

"Now! Captain!! Throw the bottle!!"

<b>

At Nosori's shout, Cedric threw the bottle he was holding towards the rising wall.

The bottle hit the top of the wall that was still rising and easily shattered, scattering its contents everywhere.

<b>

"This coating agent spreads to a thickness of 0.02 microns to cover our magic! Such a meager wall will be completely covered in no time!!"

"What do you mean meager?! What do you mean meager?!"

<b>

As Nosori said, the black wall was quickly covered in the coating agent, transforming into a silver wall.

<b>

In less than ten minutes, a long silver wall shining over 5 meters high had been completed before the knights.

<b>

"...... This is... unbelievable."

"This is astonishing."

<b>

Howard and Conrad exclaimed in amazement, looking up at the wall.

<b>

"This 'Magic Core Repulsion Coating' strengthens its repulsion power in proportion to the amount of miasma held by the user, so the larger the contained magic power, the harder it becomes to approach! Uhyohyo!"

<b>

Nosori lay sprawled on the ground, speaking nonchalantly about his creation.

Around him, Seiwashi, Joseline, and a little distance away, Morris, were similarly sprawled out.

<b>

"Hmm, this is more exhausting than expected. It really took a lot out of me... I won't be able to move for a while."

"Ahh, I'm going to die! I'm going to die!"

<b>

"Hey! What are you dawdling for?! We need to bless this 'wall' too! Otherwise, even if an army of undead comes, I guarantee it won't budge!!"

"Even as it is, it can hold out for about five days! Uhyohyo!"

<b>

Morris, still lying down, raised a weak fist and shouted advice for further strengthening the 'wall.'

Hearing this, Lisa Tuttle hurriedly gathered the holy ones and rushed to prepare to turn the wall into a 'sacred object.'

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

"Fred! Hurry up with the evacuation preparations! We'll depart as soon as Lisa and the others finish their work!! Tony! Norman! Line up the surviving horses!!"

<b>

The knights moved swiftly after the wall was completed.

Cedric Meyer directed the leaders of each unit, urging them to hasten the retreat preparations.

The deep night had already fallen around them.

In the daily life of the town, people would be starting to prepare for bed to relieve the fatigue of the day.

However, in this deep forest, there was no one lacking in vigor.

<b>

"Cedric, do you think we can make it?"

"Lord Cloud! Lord Conrad! Thanks to the three scholars, it seems we can manage!"

<b>

Cedric replied to Howard with a clear voice.

<b>

"Indeed, just having a prospect for evacuation is a miracle."

"Absolutely! To completely seal that away is beyond imagination!"

<b>

Gahaha, Conrad laughed heartily, and Howard smiled in response.

But soon, he straightened up and spoke to Cedric.

<b>

"If we return to the village, there will be a 'large-scale protective barrier' deployed by the temple. Before that powerful and sacred barrier, the unclean cannot enter the village. Even an army of over ten thousand would be the same. As long as we can reach the village, it will no longer be a one-sided defense. We can fight head-on without worrying about what's behind us. 'Returning safely to Amukamu' is now our only victory condition."

<b>

Facing Howard's words, Cedric nodded silently.

<b>

"We three will take on the rear."

"But Lord Cloud! That means...!"

"Ha... Our duty is to guide the knights to Iroshio and return them safely! You all just need to hurry to the village without worrying about what's behind you!! Or is it that you are uneasy leaving your back to us?"

"Of course not! Having you all take on the rear is the most reassuring thing!"

"Then entrust your back to us and proceed without looking back!"

<b>

At Howard's words, Cedric took a step back and bowed his head quietly.

<b>

"Of course, I will accompany you."

"I would like to join as well! Please allow me!"

<b>

Kyle Irvine and Tony Easton stepped forward from behind Cedric.

Kyle seemed to imply that it was only natural for him to be with Howard and the others.

Tony bowed his head to Conrad, seeking permission to act together.

<b>

"Gahaha! You've developed quite a good demeanor in just a few days! Right, Tony?!"

<b>

Conrad laughed heartily, patting Tony's back.

<b>

"Let's drive the main body from behind and let your friends catch up!"

"Y-yes!!"

<b>

Conrad's loud laughter echoed even more.

Howard and Cedric watched their exchange from a little distance, quietly smiling.

<b>

<b>

Jalari... a small sound was heard.

<b>

<b>

Behind Howard and the others, many were bustling about, and a medley of sounds filled the air.

The sound of hooves as horses trod the ground.

The loud metallic clanging of weapons being carried by the logistics team.

The friction of heavy objects being dragged.

The hurried footsteps of many running around.

And the shouts of people calling out to one another.

<b>

"Really, my body won't move at all?"

"Uh oh! This is bad! At this rate, the already frail Nosori will become even more frail! This is serious!!"

"What are you saying?! Isn't Morris, who's already falling apart, in a worse state?! The consequences of overexertion are huge!!"

"Ah, I can't move at all. But being carried like this is really easy and makes me happy."

"Hmm, it seems everyone is not experiencing any consciousness confusion. The body may not move for a while, but there are no issues."

<b>

The usual banter of the three scholars and their assistant being carried on a stretcher by the logistics team could be heard.

<b>

<b>

...Jalari

<b>

<b>

"Lisa, are you done with your work?"

<b>

Kyle called out to Lisa Tuttle, who was walking towards them with the silver wall behind her.

<b>

"Yes, it's finished. This wall is amazing; its absorption rate of holy energy is very good. Soon the entire wall will become a 'sacred object.'"

<b>

<b>

...Jara, ...Jararara

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work, Lisa. I'm sorry we couldn't let you rest properly, but please hurry and start moving preparations with the others."

"Don't worry about me, Lisa. As long as we are behind you, the unclean won't be able to reach you."

<b>

As soon as Cedric finished his words of encouragement, Kyle smiled broadly, assuring Lisa that there was nothing to worry about.

Seeing this, Howard and Conrad exchanged glances and shrugged.

<b>

<b>

Jara! Jararalara...!

<b>

Lisa briefly gazed at Kyle with her large black eyes, then began to giggle softly...

<b>

"I understand, Kyle. Please... h-huh?! ... Eek?!"

<b>

Suddenly, she felt a jolt from behind as if something had poked her, causing her body to lurch forward.

When Lisa looked down at her abdomen in surprise, she saw a thick, blood-stained, rusted chain rising up like a serpent, writhing as if it were alive.

<b>

"...Ah,... ah,... hi, ah! ... Kuhii! Igi! Ah! Gii!!"

<b>

Lisa's eyes widened in horror as she struggled to comprehend what was happening to her, her hands grasping at the air as if trying to grab something.

The chain pushed through her flesh without restraint, the thick loop emerging from her abdomen, each time eliciting a cry of anguish from her throat.

The azure velvet robe she wore was soaked in her blood, spreading dark stains across it.

Lisa's legs trembled violently, unable to support her. Yet, her body did not fall to the ground.

The chain that had pierced her waist and protruded from her abdomen was lifting her body off the ground.

Blood flowed down her thighs, pooling at her feet.

<b>

"Hi! Agii!! Hiiigiiiii!!!"

<b>

The chain surged upward with renewed vigor. Against the backdrop of the faintly glowing wall, Lisa's scream echoed through the dark forest.

<b>

"Lisa!!!"

<b>

Kyle shouted her name as he ran toward her.

Just as he kicked off the ground, two shadows zipped past him like the wind. It was Howard and Conrad.

<b>

Though they had been a bit behind Kyle, they sprang into action the moment the chain pierced Lisa.

Kyle's initial movement wasn't slow; he had moved less than a second after seeing the chain.

It was more that the movements of the other two were extraordinary.

<b>

With the speed of a gale, the two rushed toward Lisa.

Howard reached out to suppress the rising chain, trying to protect Lisa.

Conrad raised his battle axe, aiming to sever the chain that extended from the darkness.

<b>

However, before they could reach Lisa, the chain quickly coiled around her entire body. Then, as if a giant had grabbed her ankle and was laughing, it yanked her down, dragging her into the depths of the forest's darkness in an instant.

<b>

"Hiig! Iya! Noooooo!!!"

<b>

Lisa's heart-wrenching scream faded into the darkness as Howard's hand grasped at empty air, and Conrad's battle axe merely struck the ground, sending dull vibrations through the area.

<b>

But there was another shadow breaking through the darkness.

Gilberto, with the magic mark of the eye patch that detects magic, raced toward the source of the chains.

Gilberto lowered his body, charging toward the grotesque entity writhing in the forest.

<b>

"Nu?! No! Get away, Gilberto!!"

<b>

Howard shouted just as the silver wall was enveloped in a flash of light.

<b>

Gilberto's eyes caught the anomaly simultaneously. He instantly leaped backward from that spot.

In the next moment, a deafening roar erupted as the spot where Gilberto had just been was blasted away, engulfed in a torrent of flames.

<b>

"Ku! A firestorm?!"

<b>

Cedric shielded his face with his arm to avoid being burned by the rising flames, shouting that it was a strike from a high-level spell.

The roaring flames subsided quickly, but the trees inside and outside the wall ignited, slicing through the darkness of the surrounding forest.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I came to check on the strange flow of magic... and it seems quite interesting is happening here, isn't it?"

<b>

Out of nowhere, a woman in a black night dress, incongruous with the deep forest, stood elegantly before the destroyed wall, with the burning trees behind her.

The woman, with golden blonde hair cascading in loose waves to her waist, let the heat of the surrounding flames dance around her as she placed her hand thoughtfully over her mouth and chuckled softly.

<b>

"Oh... there are some really strong ones here! I like it! Just my type!!"

<b>

From the right side of Howard and the others, another woman emerged from the darkness of the eastern forest.

This woman had brown skin, long black hair tied back with a hair tie, cascading down like a long tail.

She wore shoulder pads, gauntlets, and shin guards, but her body was clad only in thin strings and a bikini armor that barely covered her.

She carried a sword that resembled a large single-edged knife, almost as tall as herself, on her shoulder, grinning mischievously.

<b>

"Hehe, look, look! We caught a priest... and even a maiden! This will make the perfect offering to Lord Halbert."

<b>

Another woman appeared from the darkness of the west, making a clattering sound with her metal accessories.

With pale blue skin and slightly pointed ears, her white hair was tied up and gathered on top of her head.

She wore black leather bondage, with thin belts barely covering her private parts.

From the collar and shackles around her wrists and ankles, thick rusted chains hung down, clanking around her.

<b>

The chains surrounded her, pulsating as if alive. One of the chains rattled upward, rising into the air.

<b>

There, Lisa, who had just disappeared into the forest's darkness, was being hoisted up, groaning muffledly as she was lifted by her feet.

Upon closer inspection, several other chains were also pulling up, and behind the woman with the chains, multiple figures were suspended.

They were the holy members of the knight group, just like Lisa.

Now, all four holy members remaining in the squad were captured behind the woman, who was giggling.

<b>

"This is absurd...! When did this happen?!"

<b>

Kyle gasped, his eyes widening as he looked at the captured individuals.

He had been so focused on Lisa's attack that he hadn't noticed the others had been attacked as well, and he couldn't hide his agitation.

It wasn't just Kyle; Cedric, Howard, and Conrad felt the same way.

<b>

"Hehe, taking out the healing classes first is basic strategy in group battles, isn't it?"

<b>

The woman laughed, ringing her chains and bringing her hand to her mouth, licking the blood that had stuck to it sensually, as if it were only natural.

Before they knew it, the other two women had also gathered nearby, standing together.

All three had lips as red as blood, their eyes glowing like embers in the darkness of the forest.

<b>

"Vampires..."

<b>

Howard muttered, deepening the furrow in his brow.

<b>

Illuminated by the flickering flames still clinging to the trees, the three women grinned wickedly, their red lips curling up.

The sound of the roaring flames and the clanking of chains, along with the moans of the captured individuals, echoed as the women's defiant laughter resonated through the deep forest.

Please wait a while for the next post.

I hope it will be up around next week... (distant gaze)
