# 69 Episode 69 Three Doctors of the North

There are some cruel descriptions. Please be careful if you do not like it.

You already know that manulite is a mineral with an extremely high conductivity of magic power. ...... A vein of this high purity is spreading here now."

<blank>

Morris Baltasar was walking out of the tent, a small bag slung over his shoulder, pointing around him.

<blank>

I've been trying for a long time. "I've been trying for a long time," he said. "I wondered if I could dig out just the minerals I wanted freely from the ground. and ......"

<blank>

Behind Morris, Nosoli and Seyvashi are being dragged along, as is his assistant, Joseline Joslain.

Cedric and the rest of the Knights followed them to the outside of the barricade they had set up.

Around them, Cornell and the other members of the solidary are advancing at a steady pace, keeping a watchful eye on their surroundings.

<blank>

Well, it didn't work out that way! ...... Still! I can now affect the minerals I'm after! Now we just need to apply the 'earth wall'!"

<blank>

Morris was five or six meters away from the barricade.　Not by a little more.　Morris was mumbling something to himself as he put his hands on the ground here and there as if he was looking for something.

At one point, Morris muttered, "Hmm, here we are!　and opened his bag and pulled out a small, folded survival shovel-like object from it.

Morris takes hold of the shovel's thick handle and back handle and pulls with a jerk, and the shovel extends one step longer with a jerking sound.

As it was, the sharply pointed tip of the shovel was thrust vigorously into the ground up to the root with a zap.

<blank>

The cool thing about this is that it works as long as the target mineral is present! I've brought this for just such an occasion! With this, I'm going to build a great wall! But that's all if we run out of magic! ...... So, get me out of here, Mr. Seiwashi! You have it, don't you? You got something for me, too?

<blank>

Seiwashi Melchio raised one eyebrow and accepted a large, round, cylindrical, adjuster-case-like bag that his assistant Joseline had given him, and inside he pulled out a brass-colored stick-like object about 30 centimeters long.

The sticks were connected to other objects by thin chains at the ends, and were removed with a jingling sound, with several sticks connected to each other.

<blank>

I have also brought this with me for such an occasion. I also brought it with me for this kind of thing. It is useless unless there is a huge amount of magic pressure and flow like here, and it can only be controlled by people like us who are familiar with magic control. It is a very localized and extremely poor usability device that is very selective in its users. Now, Joseline, are you ready? Are you ready?

"Huh? Is it me? I'm going to do it too?

"Well, why not? Let's hurry up and get ready.

<blank>

"Wow, wow, wow, wow! I wonder if I'm getting blurry!"

Of course! Nosoli, you have one too, don't you? Come on! Let it out! Let me out!

"Woo hoo hoo hoo! Is this it? Is this the 'magic nuclear repulsive plating' that I've been secretly developing, just in case something like this happens?

<blank>

Prompted by Morris, Nosoli Casbal also rummaged through the pocket of his white coat and pulled out a medicine bottle-like object.

<blank>

The original purpose of this product was to repel the miasma that is caused by the miasma that is generated by magic-generating creatures! It is expected to be very effective against the undead!

<blank>

He then tossed the pill bottle toward Cedric.

<blank>

That's it, Battalion Chief! Throw this bottle at the wall when it comes up! "Throw this bottle at the wall when it rises up, and Morris's cheap mud wall will instantly turn into a luxurious silver wall!

What is it? It's your head that's flimsy!"

I didn't say anything about flimsy. I'm not talking about the head! It seems that Mr. Morris has finally become an old geezer even to his ears...!

<blank>

"Well, you two, we're all ready to go. Let's get on with it.

<blank>

Seywash, together with Joseline, had lined up and spread out sticks around the spot where Morris was standing, drawing a semicircular spider web-like magic circle.

Then Joseline asked a fearfully honest question as she put down her stick.

<blank>

"Oh, um... ............. How is it that you all have such a conveniently prepared and useful item?"

<blank>

At Joseline's words, Nosoli, Morris, and Seywash all opened their mouths lightly in dismay, their eyebrows furrowed in a figure of eight and their brows wrinkled, and they looked at her with a glare that was almost too much for them.

<blank>

What is it? Why are you all looking at me as if you're looking at me like I'm looking at something crazy?

"You're a dumb girl, ......, if you can't understand something so obvious. ......

"It's absolutely, absolutely lamentable."

I am truly ashamed of myself as your mentor. As your teacher, I am truly embarrassed.

What is this? What the hell are you doing?

<blank>

"That's why they call it 'joseki,' isn't it?"

<blank>

I don't know what you mean!

<blank>

<blank>

Hmmm, well, so much for the fun and games, let's get started."

"Oh, no, I've been played!"

<blank>

The web-like magic circle, made of sticks spread by Seywash, fanned out with Morris at its center.

At the edge of the web, just behind Morris on the inside of the outermost line, stands the sardine, to his left the nosori, and to his right Joseline.

<blank>

Let's do it! Are you ready for this?

"Well, that's no problem. The three of us will control the magic. Morris, you just have to concentrate on activating the technique.

Awww, awww."

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it! Mr. Morris. No need for your silly jokes. I'll just get on with it! Oh, I see you've already started to get dopey!"

You're a little shy, aren't you? Nosori, you are! Let's do it! This is the cry of the earth!

<blank>

Morris grips the handle of the shovel, which he thrust into the ground, and puts magic power into the shovel's main body, "Earth Knocker," to deploy a magic formula.

At the same time, the feet of the three people surrounding Morris lit up, and the light flowed directly into the magic circle, gathering to Morris in the center.

<blank>

The mechanism is quite simple. By intentionally creating a low-pressure field in the high-pressure flow of Irosio's magic power, the magic power will flow in on its own. The path of that magic flow is formed by our magic power, so if you don't concentrate, your magic power will be depleted at once. Be careful.

Aww, aww! Awww!"

The magic pressure is much higher than expected. We need to control the flow speed while adjusting the magic diameter. If the flow exceeds a certain speed, turbulence will occur, which will cause a lot of loss. If we don't maintain a laminar flow, we will lose a lot of magic power.

 My blood vessels are about to burst....

"Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow! It works! My shoulders are getting lighter and lighter!

My blood vessels...my blood vessels in my brain...they're going to break! It's going to break! In the nose! My nose is bleeding! ......ubbeboaapppppiii!"

"Woo hoo! This, this girl! Not a nosebleed! She's blowing her nose so much that I can't even look at her face! I can't even look at her face. ...... Poor ...... poor little thing."

Bibibibyee, bawaiibo bokaee, zubyee, bweebabayee, bobyee. Zubibi, bibai bouzenyi zubi zubidsubui!"

"You're so dirty! Blow your nose! Sniffle!

 Zubi! I can't go to the bride... shh shh shh shh shh shh... zviiiiiiiim!"

"I'm ............ surprised you're still willing to go, ......

"Well, that's quite a surprise coming out, isn't it?

It's too much! The teachers are too much!

<blank>

Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Here it comes! It's on the boil! It's overflowing! It's on a rolling boil!

<blank>

Cracks in the ground were spreading around the shovel that had been thrust into the ground, and a pale light was leaking from the cracks in the earth.

<blank>

Wake up! Get up! Get up, get up, get up, get up!

<blank>

Morris turned his grip 90 degrees, pointed it at the thick, tubular shaft, and pushed it in as hard as he could.

At that moment, the light overflowing from the crack shone brightly.

<blank>

That's it, that's it, that's it! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

"Oh, Mr. Morris, you're here for the ride."

"Hmmm, you're in a rare groove."

 Aaadadjibbaa, aaadjibbaa, aaadjibbaa, aaadjibbaa, aaadjibbaa, aaadjibbaa!!!"

<blank>

Morris increased the speed at which he pushed down on the handle, as if he were pumping air through it.

As if in response, the light overflowing from the earth grows louder.

The cracks widened and ran wider and wider, and the earth also swelled up, bobbing up and down with the magic power that was sent through it.

<blank>

Go, go, go, go, go, go! Let's go!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

A thunderous roar echoed around the area, and a black rock wall came crashing up through the ground surface with great force.

<blank>

The black wall, with Morris at its apex, drew a circle around it, scattering the few undead in the vicinity, pushing up trees, reaping them, and fanning out, rising up toward the "black rock" far in front.

It was rapidly building up to encircle the fearless group that was stirring in front of the "Black Rock".

<blank>

Now! Battalion Chief! Throw the bottle at him!

<blank>

At Nosoli's cry, Cedric threw the bottle in his hand against the rising wall.

When the bottle hit the top of the wall, which was still growing, it shattered easily, scattering its contents around the area.

<blank>

This coating spreads 0.02 microns thin to cover our magic power! It will cover this poor wall in no time!

What is "poor-ness? What is poor?

<blank>

As Nosoli said, the black walls were covered with a coating that transformed them into silvery white walls.

<blank>

Not more than ten minutes later, a long, shining, silvery-white wall more than five meters high was built in front of the knights' eyes.

<blank>

"This is ...... outrageous."

This guy, he really knocked my socks off."

<blank>

Howard and Conrad looked up at the wall, their eyes wide, and muttered in dismay.

<blank>

The more you have the ability to do this, the more you will be able to do it! The bigger the opponent's magic power is, the harder it will be to get close to him!

<blank>

Nosoli, lying on the ground with his arms and legs thrown out, spoke in an aloof tone about his creations.

Around them, Seiwaashi, Joseline, and a little further away, Morris are lying in the same way.

<blank>

Hm, more wear and tear than I expected. As I expected, they took it all. ...... I don't think I'll be able to move for a while.

"Ohhhhh, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die..."

<blank>

What the hell is this? What are you doing? Give the Wall your blessing as it is! Then, I assure you, the undead will not even be able to stand against an army of 10,000 men!

I can endure for five days or so as it is! Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

<blank>

Morris, sprawled out, raised a powerless fist and shouted advice for further strengthening of the "wall".

Hearing this, Lisa Tuttle hurriedly gathered all the people of the Holy Order and hurriedly ran to prepare the wall to be "sanctified".

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Fred! Hurry up with the cleanup preparations! We'll leave as soon as Lisa and the others are done! Tony! Norman! Get the surviving horses lined up!

<blank>

Once the wall was built, the Knights moved quickly.

Cedric Meyer sends instructions to the head of each unit to hasten preparations for withdrawal.

The deep night was already falling around the area.

In the city, people are getting ready for bed after a long day.

But in this deep forest, there was no one here whose movements were lackluster.

<blank>

"Mister Cedric, are you ready to go?"

Sir Cloud! Sir Conrad! Thanks to the three doctors, we're going to be okay."

<blank>

To Howard, who approached him, Cedric replied in a non-staccato voice.

<blank>

"Well, it's a miracle we even have a chance of pulling out."

It's completely unimaginable to contain that thing in its entirety! Containing that thing in its entirety is completely unimaginable!"

<blank>

Conrad bursts out laughing, and Howard's cheeks relax as if he is following his lead.

However, he immediately straightened his appearance and turned to Cedric and spoke to him.

<blank>

If you go back to the village, you will find a "large scale protective ward" deployed by the temple. Against such a powerful and sacred ward, no impurity can penetrate into the village. It is the same for an army of more than 10,000 people. Once you reach the village, it is no longer a one-sided defensive battle. We can fight each other head-on without worrying about what is behind us. The only condition for victory now is to return safely to Amkham.

<blank>

Facing Howard's words head-on, Cedric nodded silently.

<blank>

The three of us will take over.

But Sir Cloud! Then ......!"

It is our duty to lead the Knights to Irosio and return them safely! You guys can hurry on your way to the village without worrying about what's behind you! Or what? Are you worried about leaving us behind?"

No way! Nothing would be more reassuring than to have you all serve as my lord!"

Then put your backs to us and go forward without a second thought!"

<blank>

At Howard's words, Cedric stepped down and hung his head quietly.

<blank>

Of course I'm going with you.

Please allow me to join you! Please!"

<blank>

Kyle Irvine and Tony Easton came forward from behind Cedric.

Kyle tried to say that he deserves to be with Howard and the others.

Tony bowed to Conrad and asked for permission to join the action.

<blank>

Gahahahaha! You've got a good look in these days, don't you? Yeah? Tony?

<blank>

Conrad laughed boldly and slapped Tony on the back with a bang.

<blank>

Let's drive the main body from behind and let your friend who got ahead of us catch up!"

Yes, yes!

<blank>

Even louder, Conrad's high pitched laugh echoes.

Howard and Cedric, who were a short distance away, were watching the exchange with a quiet smile on their faces.

<blank>

<blank>

Jalali ...... and a small sound was heard.

<blank>

<blank>

Behind Howard and the others, many are moving hurriedly, and miscellaneous sounds abound.

<blank>

The sound of hoof beats of horses stamping their feet.

A hard, noisy metallic sound is made by the clashing of the armaments carried by the logistics unit.

The sound of friction dragging a large, heavy object.

The sound of quick footsteps, echoing as many run around.

And the cries of people who answer and call out for someone.

<blank>

"Are you sure you can't move your body?"

Mmm! It's not good, is it? At this rate, even a shriveled up old man like Mr. Nosori will turn into a shriveled up old man like Mr. Nosori! Oh, no!

What are you talking about? Morris, you're the one who's getting tired, your back is already in trouble, isn't it? The cost of overworking is huge!

"Oh, I can't move my body at all. But I'm very happy that I can be carried like this.

"Well, everyone seems to be in a clear state of consciousness," he said. The bodies will be immobile for a while, but there's nothing wrong with them.

<blank>

We also hear the same exchange between the three doctors and their assistants as they are carried away on a stretcher by the logistics team.

<blank>

<blank>

...... jalali

<blank>

<blank>

Lisa, have you finished your work yet?"

<blank>

Kyle called out to Lisa Tuttle, who was walking toward him against the silvery white wall.

<blank>

Yeah, it's done. It's amazing, this wall absorbs so much holy energy. Soon the whole wall will become a holy artifact.

<blank>

<blank>

......jarrah, ......jarrah

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you, Lisa. As far as I'm concerned, I'm sorry I couldn't give you a break, but I need you to get your unit ready to move out immediately."

Don't worry, Lisa. As long as we are behind you, you will not be touched by the unholy ones.

<blank>

As soon as Cedric finished his exertions, Kyle showed his white teeth and told Lisa there was nothing to worry about.

Howard and Conrad, who had been watching, looked at each other and shrugged.

<blank>

<blank>

Jalala! Jalala! ......!

<blank>

<blank>

Lisa stared at Kyle for a moment with her big black eyes, then giggled and laughed, laughing at .......

<blank>

I know, Kyle. Please ...... hahagukku? ......hi! ...... hih?

<blank>

With a thump, Lisa's body moves forward as if something poked her from behind.

<blank>

When Lisa looked at her lower belly, where she felt the shock, she saw a thick, rusty red chain covered in Lisa's blood protruding from it, like a snake lifting its sickle, and stretching out like a living creature.

<blank>

"......Ah, ......Ah, ......Hi, ah! ...... kuhi! Igi! Aah! Gee!

<blank>

Lisa's eyes widen to the point of overflowing, as if she has no idea what is happening to her, and her hands grip the sky repeatedly as if she is trying to grasp something.

The chain slid uninhibitedly, its thick ring pushing through and out of the flesh of her lower abdomen. Each time, Lisa's scream of agony was squeezed out from the back of her throat.

<blank>

The abdomen of the velvet robe, which had been a cool blue, was spread with Lisa's overflowing blood, spreading a thick, black stain.

Lisa's legs are shaking and she is in no condition to stand. But her body does not fall to the ground.

The chains that struck her lower back and protruded from her lower abdomen suspended her body.

The blood dripping down her thighs spreads the pool of blood that has formed at her feet.

<blank>

Hi-hi." Aggiiiii! Hiiiiiiiiiiiiii!!!"

<blank>

Jalala ......! and the chains stretched up even more vigorously. Against the backdrop of the wall, which began to glow with a faint holy light, Lisa's exclamation echoed through the dark forest.

<blank>

Risaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

Kyle ran toward her, shouting Lisa's name.

Just after he kicks the ground, two shadows overtake him as if breaking through the wind. They are Howard and Conrad.

<blank>

They were somewhat further back than Kyle and the others, but they were moving the moment the chain pierced Lisa.

Kyle's initial move was not slow. Even for him, less than a second passed between the time he saw the chains and the time he made his move.

More than that, their movements are unusual.

<blank>

With the speed of a gale, the two men close in on Lisa.

Howard holds back the growing chain and reaches out to protect Lisa.

Conrad raised his battle-axe to break the chains extending out from the darkness.

<blank>

However, before they could reach Lisa, the chain that had been extended momentarily entangled her entire body. And then, as if the giant who had grabbed her ankle had sneered and pulled her down all at once, the chain wrapped around her right ankle pulled her down, and in an instant Lisa's figure disappeared into the darkness of the forest.

<blank>

Hiig! Eeee! Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！！"

<blank>

Howard's hand gripped the sky, and Conrad's battle-axe simply pierced the earth, sending a dull vibration through the area as Lisa's shrieks of pain disappeared into the darkness.

<blank>

But there was one more shadow passing through the darkness.

Gilberto, insinuating the magical mark of an eyepatch that detects evil, runs toward the source of the chain.

Gilbert lowered himself and pushed forward to something fearless that was stirring in the forest that his eyes had caught.

<blank>

Nooo? No good! Dodge, Gilbert!

<blank>

At the same time Howard shouted this, the silvery-white wall that had been emitting a faint light was enveloped in a flash of light.

<blank>

Gilbert's eyes caught the anomaly at the same time. He instantly leapt backward from the spot.

Immediately after, the place where Gilberto had been just before was engulfed by a torrent of flames that roared, blew out the walls, and engulfed the place where he had been.

<blank>

I'm going to go to the bathroom and get some water! A firestorm?

<blank>

Cedric, protecting his face with his arms to avoid being burned by the growing flames, exclaims that it is the upper magic blow.

The stream of flames that roared and blew immediately subsided, but the trees inside and outside the walls were ablaze, cutting through the darkness of the surrounding forest.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"I came here because there was a very strange flow of magic, ......, and it's getting very interesting, isn't it?"

<blank>

When and from where did she appear? ......, a woman in a black nightdress that looks out of place in the depths of the great forest, or perhaps only uncomfortably so, stands lounging against the burning trees in front of a destroyed wall.

<blank>

The woman's golden blonde hair, which reached down to her waist in loose waves, was dancing in the heat of the flames that engulfed the area, and she was smiling with her hand over her mouth in distress.

<blank>

I'm sure there's a strong one here at ......! I like it! That's my kind of guy!

<blank>

On the right side of Howard and the others, who were looking at the woman in black against the wall, another woman appeared out of the darkness to the east of the forest.

<blank>

The woman has brown skin and long black hair tied back behind her head with a hair string that hangs down like a long tail.

Although they are equipped with shoulder pads, cuirasses, and shin guards, they have only thin strings and a small area of bikini armor on their bodies.

He carried a machete-like single-edged sword as tall as he was on his shoulder and smiled with the corners of his mouth turned up.

<blank>

'Hmmm, look how many clergymen I caught ...... and even a damsel. It will make a great offering to Master Halbert."

<blank>

Another, this time a woman appeared from the darkness to the west, jangling and clanging with metallic sounds.

She has pale blue skin and slightly pointed ears, and her silver-white hair is tied up and tucked over her head.

The body is clad in a black leather bondage, with a thin belt barely concealing the area.

Thick chains, both thick with martial red rust, hung from the collar and the shackles attached to their wrists and ankles.

<blank>

The chains were placed on the ground as if surrounding and circling the woman, pulsating and writhing on the spot. The chains extended outward from the woman's body.

One of the chains is pulled upward with a jingling sound.

<blank>

<blank>

There came Lisa, who had disappeared into the darkness of the forest earlier, lifted off her feet with a muffled moan.

I noticed that several other chains had been pulled up, and behind the chain-wearing woman, I could see several figures hanging from the chains.

It was the same knights of the Order of the Holy Order as Lisa.

Now, all four of the battalion's only four members of the Holy Order were captured behind the back of a giggling woman.

<blank>

'Stupid ......! When did that happen?

<blank>

Kyle turned to his captors and grunted.

Although he was distracted by Lisa, who was attacked in front of him, he could not hide his upset that he was unaware that anyone else had been attacked at all.

It was not only Kyle, but Cedric, Howard and Conrad as well.

<blank>

"Ummmmmmm...isn't it a basic principle of group warfare to destroy the recovery workers first?"

<blank>

The woman laughed as a matter of course as she snapped the chain and brought her hand to her mouth, licking off the blood that was sticking to her hand in a glistening manner.

<blank>

Before long, the other two women were close by, and the three women stood together.

All three have lips as red as blood and eyes as red as coals in the darkness of the forest.

<blank>

Vampires or ......"

<blank>

Howard's brow wrinkled deeply and he muttered.

<blank>

The three women, their red mouths hanging open, laugh suspiciously in the light of the flames from the trees that have not yet disappeared.

The sound of flames exploding, the metallic clang of chains, and the women's fearless laughter echoing through the deep forest, mocking the moans of anguish from the hanged.
