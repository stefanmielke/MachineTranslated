# 203 Episode 203 Reilly Niven's Regrets.

A continuous metallic sound echoes around the area.

Sparks fly in time with the sharp sound that echoes without pause, and each time a two-handed sword appears as if cut out of the darkness, claws like black daggers, Irving's face, which raises the corners of its mouth ferociously, and Van's face with its temperatureless expression, float in and out.

<blank>

We were just hoping to meet you."

I'm not surprised. Me too!"

<blank>

It is a brief momentary exchange between sparks.

The echo of the sword moves from place to place at a dizzying pace.

You hear the sound of swords clashing here and now, and a moment later sparks fly a few meters away.

It is not something that an ordinary person's eyes can follow.

<blank>

What about ......?"

What?　What?"

"Hey, you guys!　Back off!

<blank>

Beatrice sends a sharp warning to Reilly and Lurie, who are unable to keep up with the situation.

On both of her shoulders, two small white animals are peeking out.

Suddenly, Algernon, riding on his right shoulder, turned his nose toward the depths of the forest and made a short warning sound.

<blank>

The sound of a beast running looms from deep in the dark forest.

Beatrice clucked her tongue a little and put her hand on the ground to cast a spell.

A Thorn in the Earth."

Suddenly, the ground rose up like thorns, thrusting Beatrice forward.

<blank>

The terra-dogs on the front lines were instantly pierced by stone spikes.

But as if to continue further, several beasts came running through the trees from the back.

The beasts jumped over the barricades made of stone spikes one after another.

<blank>

Lurie Deet's throat twitched as she saw the fangs of the demonic beast approaching again.

<blank>

But those beasts are popping off from one end in midair.

The body was scattered as if popping from the edges, and only a piece of flesh could reach the ground.

<blank>

Something rumbled and rolled at Ruly's feet as he backed away with his buttocks on the ground.

When Ruly realizes that it is what used to be the head of a terra dog, he lets out a scream that squeezes out of the back of his throat.

<blank>

I better get the hell out of here."

<blank>

Mia glanced down at Lurie, who was twitching at her feet, and gave him a short warning.

As it is, Mia steps in front of Ruly, who crawls in front of her.

<blank>

Magic swirls around her arms as she thrusts them forward.

A yellow light overflows and falls from the magic bead embedded in the glove of his hand.

<blank>

Around Mia's wrist, the multiple gravels generated spun one by one at high speed and stayed in the sky to surround her arm.

Two fingertips outstretched as if capturing a target make a circular motion on the spot.

At the same time, a dozen gravels waiting around the wrist shot out in rapid succession at multiple targets with a burst of sound that pushed the atmosphere away.

<blank>

Extended Bullets

The cylindrical conglomerate, about 2 cm in diameter, has a small cavity inside.

The moment it lands on the target, it crushes the target, and at the same time, with a slight burst of magical power inside, it destroys the interior of the target in a wide area.

<blank>

The terra dogs that became the target were one after another blown up from the inside with their entire "linear magical life form" inside their bodies, and their activities were stopped.

<blank>

I guess this is the most efficient way."

<blank>

Mia made a small comment as she watched the terra-dogs continue to sweep and fly.

Mia's eyes light up with a cold light.

<blank>

Whee!"

<blank>

Lurie looks up into his eyes and lets out a scream, his throat twitching again.

<blank>

"All non-combatants must evacuate to their designated areas immediately!　You have been instructed to do so!"

<blank>

...... non-combatants."

<blank>

Reilly opens his eyes for a moment at the words Beatrice throws at him.

The fact that I am being told I am useless does not immediately enter my mind.

<blank>

Stand down!　I can't get in to cover Irving with you guys."

<blank>

Lombardo swung down a battleaxe to smash the individual, which had passed over the barricade of thorns and through Mia's barrage of bullets.

<blank>

If you see the AmCam forces in battle, you will know that they are "non-combatants" even if you don't want to be.

At the same time, I naturally understand that I am completely useless here.

<blank>

"Brother ............ Haggard!　Damn, damn ...... shit!"

<blank>

I feel a burning frustration rising up from the pit of my stomach.

But he also realized that it was his own frustration at not being able to be there.

<blank>

Let's go, Lurie."

What?　Huh?　Reilly?

<blank>

Reilly reached out his arm to Ruly, who was unable to stand up, and picked him up from his spot.

Ruly is startled by the sudden lifting of his head, and his voice rises involuntarily.

<blank>

"...... please."

<blank>

As it was, Reilly made no eye contact with anyone and muttered quietly.

Reilly himself does not know whether those words were directed at their own retreat or at his brother.

However, the feelings smoldering in my chest are so unbearable that I can hardly stand to be there.

The bite is so tight that it shatters the back teeth, blurring and distorting the vision.

<blank>

...... Reilly?"

<blank>

Reilly immediately ran from the scene, not making eye contact with Ruly, who called out to him from his arms.

<blank>

I'll take care of it.

<blank>

To which Beatrice replies in a small voice.

On their shoulders, two small animals raised their snouts.

In an attempt to follow the two, one terra dog jumped over a barricade of thorns.

But it is instantly shattered by a direct hit from Lombardo's swinging battleaxe.

<blank>

Beatrice again put her hand on the ground and increased the density of the "thorns of the earth". The thorns of the earth spread higher and wider.

Needle height was already beyond what a terra dog could jump over.

In order to follow them in the shortest possible time, we have to get through the gap in the barricade where Beatrice and Lombard are.

<blank>

But Mia quickly steps inside the barricade.

Then, with "extended bullets" deployed with both arms, he crushes the approaching magical beasts from one end to the other.

A series of bursting sounds tear through the atmosphere, and one after another, the decimations of the beasts disappear into the darkness of the forest with a cloud of blood smoke.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sorry you had to go through all that trouble to let a little bug like that escape.

I know he's your brother!"

It's just trash. The very existence itself is bothersome."

<blank>

As they are about to disappear among the trees, Van says abhorrently to them.

He tried to point his black claws at its back, but Beatrice's "thorn in the earth" buried the line of fire.

Then he frowned again in displeasure.

<blank>

Adore? Admire? It makes my skin crawl. It's a foolish desire that has no place in the scheme of things."

'What's wrong with a little brother yearning for a big brother!

I say that the very act itself is disrespectful!"

Oh yeah!!!!"

<blank>

Irving stepped in with a shout. The sharp blade he released again flicked off the black claw.

There is a momentary gap in the chest, but Van instantly moves backward with a gliding motion.

However, Lombardo, who was ready and waiting for him, swung his battle-axe at him and struck him down.

Blown away by the heavy impact, Van's back was crushed and he vomited blood profusely.

But before you can see it, the wound is repaired.

<blank>

I knew he could fix it.

<blank>

Irving, standing beside Lombardo, wrinkles his nose and speaks evasively.

<blank>

Another one of your signature pushy moves?"

Oh, my God!

<blank>

Keeping an eye on Van, Lombardo asks, "Are you going to go with your usual routine?" confirms Irving.

<blank>

You little bastards!"

<blank>

Van's red eyes flared with anger and he glared hatefully at Irving and Lombardo.
