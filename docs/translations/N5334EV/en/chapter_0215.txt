# Chapter 203: Rayleigh Niven's Regret

The sound of clashing metal echoes around.

With each sharp sound, sparks fly, and each time, the two-handed sword, the claws resembling a black dagger, the fiercely grinning face of Irvin, and the expressionless face of Van appear and vanish as if cut out from the darkness.

<b>

"I was just hoping to meet you."

"What a coincidence. So was I!"

<b>

A brief exchange amidst the flying sparks.

The sound of swords clashing shifts rapidly in location.

Just when it seems like the sound of swords clashing is here, moments later, sparks fly a few meters away.

To the ordinary eye, it is impossible to follow.

<b>

"…Huh?"

"Eh? What?"

"You two! Get back!!"

<b>

Beatrice sharply warns Rayleigh and Lulie, who are unable to catch up with the situation.

On her shoulders, two small white creatures peek out.

Suddenly, Algernon on her right shoulder turns its nose toward the depths of the forest and emits a short warning sound.

<b>

The sound of beasts running approaches from the depths of the dark forest.

Beatrice clicks her tongue softly, places her hand on the ground, and chants a spell.

"Thorns of the Earth"

Instantly, the ground erupts with multiple thorns, thrusting forward toward Beatrice.

<b>

The Terradogs running at the front line are impaled by the stone thorns in an instant.

However, more beasts continue to rush through the trees from deeper within.

The beasts leap over the barricade made of protruding stone thorns one after another as they charge forward.

<b>

Lulie Diet lets out a strained sound in her throat as the fangs of the approaching magical beasts close in.

<b>

However, those beasts burst apart in mid-air.

Their bodies explode from the edges, and only mere chunks of flesh manage to land on the ground.

<b>

Something rolls toward Lulie's feet as she sits back on the ground.

Realizing it was the head of a Terradog, Lulie lets out a scream that seems to be squeezed from the depths of her throat.

<b>

"Maybe we should run away quickly."

<b>

Mia glances down at the trembling Lulie and gives a short warning.

Without hesitation, Mia steps forward toward the crawling Lulie.

<b>

Magic swirls around the arm she thrusts forward.

Yellow light spills and falls from the magic orb embedded in the glove on her hand.

<b>

Around Mia's wrist, multiple generated pebbles spin rapidly, hovering in the air surrounding her arm.

Two fingertips extend to capture the target, drawing a circle in place.

At the same time, twelve pebbles that were waiting around her wrist emit a sound that pushes aside the air and are shot in rapid succession toward multiple targets.

<b>

"Expansion Bullet"

The cylindrical pebbles, about 2 centimeters in diameter, have small cavities inside.

Upon impact with the target, they crush significantly, simultaneously bursting the small amount of magic contained within, widely destroying the insides of the target.

<b>

The Terradogs that became targets are blown apart from the inside along with their "linear magical lifeforms," ceasing their activity one after another.

<b>

"After all, this is the most efficient way."

<b>

While continuing to fire and watching the Terradogs explode, Mia mutters softly.

A cold light flickers in Mia's eyes.

<b>

"Yikes!"

<b>

Lulie, looking up at those eyes, lets out another strained scream.

<b>

"Non-combatants should evacuate to the designated area immediately! Instructions should have been given!"

<b>

"…Non-combatants"

<b>

At Beatrice's thrown words, Rayleigh opens his eyes for a moment.

The fact that he is being told he is useless does not immediately register in his mind.

<b>

"Get back! You can't assist Irvin with you here."

<b>

Rayleigh watches as Lombard crushes a creature that has crossed the thorn barricade and passed through Mia's barrage with his battle axe.

<b>

Seeing the fighting of the Amukam forces up close makes it painfully clear that they are "non-combatants."

At the same time, he naturally understands that he is utterly useless here.

<b>

"Brother… Haggard! D-Damn it… Damn it!!"

<b>

He feels a burning frustration rising from the pit of his stomach.

But he also realizes that it is irritation directed at himself for not being able to be here.

<b>

"Let's go, Lulie."

"—?! Huh? R-Rayleigh?!"

<b>

Rayleigh reaches out to Lulie, who cannot stand, and lifts her up from the spot.

Startled by being suddenly lifted, Lulie inadvertently lets out a high-pitched voice.

<b>

"…Please."

<b>

Without making eye contact with anyone, Rayleigh whispers softly.

He doesn't know if those words are directed at their escape route or to his brother; even Rayleigh himself is unsure.

Only the feelings smoldering in his chest are unbearable, making it very hard to endure.

He grits his teeth so hard that his molars feel like they might shatter, and his vision blurs and distorts.

<b>

"…Rayleigh?"

<b>

Rayleigh does not meet Lulie's gaze as she calls out from his arms and immediately starts running from the spot.

<b>

"Leave it to me."

<b>

Beatrice responds softly to that.

On her shoulder, the two small creatures raise their noses.

As one Terradog attempts to leap over the thorn barricade to follow the two, it is instantly crushed by Lombard's swinging battle axe.

<b>

Beatrice places her hand on the ground again, increasing the density of the "Thorns of the Earth." The thorns rise higher and spread wider.

The height of the needles has already surpassed the height that the Terradogs could leap over.

To catch up with the two in the shortest time, they must slip through the gaps in the barricade where Beatrice and Lombard are.

<b>

However, Mia quickly moves inside the barricade.

Then, with the "Expansion Bullets" deployed from both arms, she crushes the approaching magical beasts one after another.

The sounds of explosions tearing through the air resonate continuously, and the dying cries of the beasts vanish into the darkness of the forest along with the blood mist.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"To go through such trouble just to let those little bugs escape."

"Isn't that your brother?!"

"Just trash. Their very existence is bothersome."

<b>

Van bitterly remarks toward the two disappearing among the trees.

He tries to direct his black claws at their backs, but Beatrice's "Thorns of the Earth" fills the line of fire.

He grimaces again in displeasure.

<b>

"Adore? Long for? It makes my skin crawl. It's a foolish desire that doesn't know its place."

"Is it wrong for a brother to admire his older brother?!"

"I'm saying that the act itself is disrespectful!"

"Is that so?!!!"

<b>

As Irvin raises his voice and steps forward, the sharp blade he unleashes once again deflects Van's black claws.

For just a moment, a gap appears in his chest, but Van swiftly moves back with a sliding motion.

However, Lombard, poised to intercept, meets him with a full swing of his battle axe.

The heavy impact sends Van flying, shattering his back and causing him to spew blood profusely.

But in no time, that wound begins to heal.

<b>

"That healing ability is insane."

<b>

Standing beside Lombard, Irvin remarks with a wrinkled nose in annoyance.

<b>

"Are you going with your usual brute force again?"

"Well, yeah!"

<b>

Without taking his eyes off Van, Lombard asks Irvin, "Are we going as usual?"

<b>

"You little brats!"

<b>

Van glares at Irvin and Lombard with his red eyes burning with anger, filled with hatred.
