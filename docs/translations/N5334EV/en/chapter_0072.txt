# 67 Team Aria's Sortie

This is the end of this series of posts.


----------------

<blank>

When Suzy got ready and arrived at the I Tsumesho on time, August was waiting with a team to accompany her to the forest.

<blank>

Susie, my lady!"

Thank you again, young lady."

"We've been expecting you, miss."

Susie! I've been waiting for you!"

<blank>

Aria?

<blank>

It was Millie Barrett, Ketty Forrest, Irta Lindeman, and Alia Burok of "Team Alia".

<blank>

'Suzy, you'll be working with Team Aria after this. AnnaMary, too, please."

I'm at your service, Chief.

<blank>

Augusto brought Suzy to Team Aria and then looked directly at AnnaMarie and nodded.

<blank>

Huh? Huh? AnnaMary? Huh? Why?"

I am the one who is supposed to take care of your daughter."

<blank>

Before I knew it, AnnaMarie had changed from her usual maid's uniform to exploratory equipment.

When did she change her clothes? Susie's eyes widened.

In reality, they were being quickly changed by other maids as they proceeded through the corridors of the Amcam House. ......

<blank>

What Suzy didn't notice was that the silhouette was still in her maid's uniform.

Still, what was that? Did he take off his apron? He seemed to think so.

<blank>

AnnaMarie was wearing her usual maid's uniform, boots, gloves up to her elbows, and an undercorset, a set of three items that promised to be explored.

In addition, several belts are wrapped around the waist, to which several pouches and knives are attached.

There was unmistakably a "fighting maid" there.

<blank>

Suzy, realizing this, is about to vomit blood for a moment, but she keeps her composure with her spirit and mental strength.

（AnnaMarie? (Anna-Marie? Oh no! Real combat maids are really badass!)

But that inner voice is screaming.

<blank>

<blank>

'Ah, AnnaMary, it's been a long time. I hope you'll be glad to see me this time. ......"

"Mr. Millie, you know AnnaMarie, do you?"

<blank>

Milly Barrett's voice brought Suzy, who had been moaning inside, back to reality.

<blank>

Oh, yes, yes! AnnaMarie and I were together for three years at the Milia Castel Eye boarding school."

'It's been a long time, Millie Barrett. Good to see you again."

"Ooohhhh! Suddenly, behind me? Don't scare me, AnnaMarie! I'm really scared!

What's up? It's been a long time since I've seen my classmates, and you're not twirling, Millie?"

"Hiii! That's why! Cowering! Scary!

<blank>

Before I knew it, AnnaMarie had gone around to Millie's back side and was crawling her fingers up Millie's neck.

Millie's complexion was flustered, turning red and blue.

<blank>

Hom, what was their relationship like when they were students?

Suzy rubs her chin and ponders, "What if there is some precious fragrance?　What if there's some kind of precious fragrance?　she imagines, and her nostrils flare.

<blank>

<blank>

"Is this the Byros family's treasured son who specializes in anti-personnel combat? ....... I'm counting on you!"

I am very pleased to meet you, Miss Alia. I am very grateful to the eldest daughter of the Blouk family for her high expectations.

I'm afraid he's modest. I'd like to have a meeting with you once, if possible.

"If it's all right with me, I'm always available?"

<blank>

For some reason, the two were laughing at each other while squinting at each other, "Kukkukkukkukkukkukkukku.

<blank>

When Aria says 'hand-to-hand', all I can think of is the already obscene image."

Ketty? What do you mean?

<blank>

Suzy rolls her eyes as Aria, who had been creating a piquant atmosphere and a manly smile, suddenly starts MANZAI.

Then with a clap of hands, August came in between.

<blank>

That's all I'm going to say. Time is running out. You know what you have to do."

<blank>

Of course!

I know what I'm doing.

<blank>

Aria and AnnaMarie answer August's question.

The other three nodded silently in place.

<blank>

AnnaMarie went behind Suzy's back, said, "Excuse me," and began to do her hair.

<blank>

Susie, you and AnnaMarie will now be joining Ilocio as members of Team Aria. You and AnnaMarie will now enter Irosio as members of Team Aria."

<blank>

August stood in front of Suzy and began to talk.

Susie tilted her head and looked up at August with a "why? Susie tilted her head and looked up at August with an expression that said, "Why?

<blank>

For those of us who live in the forests of Amkam, the powerful are respected and honored. Your power is known to everyone in the village. Everyone in the village rejoiced that you chose to stay and live with us in this village.

<blank>

At August's words, Aria, Irta, Ketty, Millie, and AnnaMarie nodded happily.

<blank>

We accept you and your power. But what about those outside? They see your power as a threat. When they learn of your power, they will try to eliminate you or bring you under their control.

<blank>

August's calm expression changed to a stern one.

Susie, too, turns a serious gaze toward August.

<blank>

But since you belong to AMCAM, we will protect you from any and all!"

<blank>

August placed his left hand on Susie's shoulder, clenched his fist with his right on his own chest, and declared emphatically.

<blank>

You have now begun to assume the role of 'Princess of Amukam' and this is a joy for everyone in the village. This is a joy for all of us in the village.

<blank>

<blank>

For a frontier place like Amkham, it is not the bloodline that is important to carry on the family name.

If a powerless person took over the reigns, the house could easily be lost, and the village itself could disappear.

From ancient times, the most important thing was 'strength'.

For this reason, he was constantly repeating the idea of having stronger personnel take over the house.

Bloodline is not important to Amcam.

It is important to have a container called a "house" to protect the people.

The politics should be left to the best and most experienced people around.

The flag bearer of Amcam must always be strong and lead the people.

Otherwise, this village could easily be swallowed up by Irosio.

<blank>

Because of this historical background of Amkham, Suzy was welcomed and worshipped by the villagers as the "Princess of Amkham.

<blank>

However, the person in question is making a subtle expression, saying, "Eeeee ......, princess is ...... that's ......, ahhhhhhh.

Whether or not he knew of Suzy's expression, August continued his story.

<blank>

We will protect your 'princess' face from now on, and your 'power' as well. And your 'power' as well."

<blank>

August's eyes are filled with power.

Suzy noticed this, too, and once again stared squarely into his eyes.

<blank>

The Order of the Knights is an organization under the direct control of the Royal Capital. If your power becomes known to the Order, it will be known to the Royal Council at the same time. That must be avoided at all costs. That is not what the head of the Order wants. Your presence as a force is the "best-kept secret" of AMCAM!

<blank>

At the same time August said this, AnnaMarie, who had Suzy's hair pulled up in a bun, wrapped her cloak around Suzy's body and put her hood deep over it.

<blank>

Excuse me, young lady, if I may be a little hot and bothered. My hair is loose and tied up so that it cannot be seen from the outside. Please put your hood up deeply so that no one can see your hair color.

<blank>

AnnaMarie came over to us as she put her hood up. When Susie looked up at AnnaMarie from behind her hood, she smiled and nodded.

<blank>

Susie, you took the Divination class last time after your ordeal. From now on, you will be a Uates member of Team Aria. Are we clear?"

<blank>

Suzy nodded at Aria's words.

<blank>

Oh." Yes, that's right! Try not to use words like that!

<blank>

I am sorry, Susie, for any inconvenience this may cause you. I am sure that with your help, you will be able to bring back the head of the order safely. And please do not let the Knights see you fighting with all your might."

<blank>

August said this was so that the sad events that once took place in the village would not be repeated.

Is this about the legend of the heroes? After all, something must have happened between the village, the heroes, and the country a long time ago..., Susie thinks when she hears this.

<blank>

Suzy remembered the gouged mountain range and put her hood back on deeply so as not to show her tense expression.

<blank>

We have horses ready for you. "Team leader Trevor is already on his way to the "Hill of Sorrows" and has already instructed the remaining knights on the hill to retreat. Team Aria will meet up with the leader there and head for the Black Rock.

<blank>

A village horse with no luggage should be able to reach Black Rock in four hours, August says.

<blank>

"Suzy, please ...... please ...... your head. Please!"

<blank>

August knelt down, took Susie's hand with both of his and placed it on his own forehead.

As if praying or wishing, the words escape from August's mouth.

Susie quietly knotted her mouth and nodded in silence to it.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Alia Burok of "Team Alia."

I'm Luke Trevor, leader of Team 7 of the 12th Mobile Heavy Knights. You may call me Luke."

I'm Aria, too. Please take care of me."

I'm looking forward to working with you! I hear you're already a 'grader' at such a young age? I'm counting on you!"

"Starting next month, though. So? Are you ready to go?"

<blank>

Aria and Trevor greeted each other with a handshake at their campsite on a hill where the sky was white.

<blank>

Around them, the knights were folding up their camp and preparing to retreat.

Instead, those from the Amkam Protectorate had begun to bring in the fence and prepare to build a protective fence.

There are more than a dozen members of the Protectorate here. These are the ones who have accompanied Trevor to the "Hill of Sorrows" with him.

In exchange, the knights were to return to the village.

<blank>

Yeah, we should be able to pull out in less than half an hour. I'm at ......, sorry, can you come over to the tent there for a minute? I could use a hand if I can borrow one."

<blank>

Trevor said and took Aria to the front, to the tent that was still set up.

<blank>

The members of "Team Aria" dismount from their horses to see them off, and they are all clumped together.

They are all wearing cloaks and hoods.

<blank>

Hey? Miss ......"

<blank>

And in a whisper, Ilta spoke to Suzy.

Susie looks up at Iltar from behind her hood.　and looks up at Iltar from behind his hood.

<blank>

'Miss, you chose 'Uates as your initial class, didn't you?

<blank>

Suzy nodded behind her hood.

<blank>

What about beyond that?" What 'class' will you choose after you go on to higher education and have your spiritual seal engraved?"

<blank>

Have you already decided?　Ilsa further inquires, "Have you already decided?

Suzy, in a slightly thoughtful manner, tilted her head and put her index finger in front of her chin .......

<blank>

Hmmm, Byrd?"

As expected! My Lady!"

<blank>

At Suzy's words, Ketty Forrest makes a small gut-punch.

<blank>

"...... huh, I knew you were right ......"

<blank>

And for some reason, Ilta let out a sigh.

Susie saw that, hmm? Why?　She tilts her head further.

<blank>

Iltá! Come here for a minute!!!!"

<blank>

Then Aria's voice echoes from the tent.

What's going on? and we all proceeded to the tent and went inside as we were invited in.

<blank>

The tent was unexpectedly large and lit by lamps. Inside, Trevor and Aria, who had entered earlier, and one logistics team member seemed to be taking care of a man lying on a cot.

<blank>

And furthermore, Suzy noticed the space beyond the cot, which was partitioned off at the end of the cot.

I know there is something on that side facing the outside.

Susie felt a familiar presence and peeked beyond the partition.

<blank>

Regulus?

<blank>

Suzy couldn't help but exclaim.

There he was, unmistakably the Cloud family's ......, Howard's beloved horse Regulus.

<blank>

Regulus was lying on a pile of blankets on the ground, bandages and large gauzes were placed all over his body, but he seemed to be bleeding badly and there was blood everywhere. He was breathing very hard and looked as if he was in a lot of pain.

Suzy unexpectedly sits down beside Regulus and puts her hands on his body.

Regulus also seemed to notice Suzy and turned to her, moving his face slightly.

<blank>

Do you know this horse?"

<blank>

Trevor saw Suzy's condition and called out to her.

<blank>

"......Yes, this is the horse he used to take good care of......"

<blank>

AnnaMarie answered between Suzy and Trevor, her face hidden by her hood.

<blank>

'Well, I heard it was your lordship's horse. ......?

"...... yeah, she's an animal lover, so ......"

'...... well, at any rate, it's nice to have someone who knows this horse. As you can see, this horse doesn't have long to ......, and I'm glad I got him to see the last person who knew him. ......"

<blank>

Those present relaxed their shoulders when Trevor did not pursue the relationship between Suzy and Regulus any further.

<blank>

...... this horse have a cure?"

<blank>

Ilta asked Trevor.

Trevor shook his head quietly at the question.

<blank>

Unfortunately, we don't have enough surgeons here right now to heal such a large animal. Even Casey, who is lying next to me, was able to close up a large wound, but has yet to fully recover. ......"

<blank>

Trevor looked alternately at Regulus and Casey Guinness, who was lying in bed with him, as if to say he was sorry.

<blank>

Casey is having a hard time getting her back to the village at this point. So I was wondering if we could ask the healers from Team Aria to help her recover. ......"

<blank>

Ilta looked at Aria and nodded to each other.

<blank>

I understand. I'll take care of it. But I need to concentrate, so I need everyone to stay out of the room except for the members."

I see! Will you do it? Thank you! All I have to do is stay outside? Okay! We'll be waiting outside, take care of Casey!

<blank>

After saying this, Trevor, accompanied by those from the logistics unit, bowed to Irta and walked out of the tent.

Suzy, who was squatting and stroking Regulus and looking at him sideways, turns to Ilta and speaks.

<blank>

......Ilta, may I have a go, please?"

I know, sweetheart. I knew you'd say that, which is why I asked those guys to leave the table ....... You want to fix this horse, don't you?"

<blank>

Suzy nodded as she looked up at Irta.

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Irta."

<blank>

After smiling at Irta, Suzy slowly uses her skills on Regulus and Casey Guinness.

<blank>

<blank>

≪Vitality Release.

The skills of the "Great Wiseman", Suzy's divinity rank recovery job.

All HP and MP of all allies around you are restored.

The extra HP recovery also restores stamina, and the skill keeps the HP automatically recovering for several minutes.

<blank>

A ripple of light spread around Suzy.

At the same time, a pillar of light rises from Casey Guinness and Regulus, and the damaged parts of their bodies and their strength are restored.

<blank>

As soon as the pillar of light disappeared, Regulus stood up and began to whine. He seemed to understand that he had been restored by Suzy.

He continued to rub the tip of his nose against Susie's face and began licking her face.

<blank>

Le, Regulus! Wow! I got it from ......! That tickled ......!

<blank>

Regulus' tongue, which licked and licked so hard that even Suzy's hood was almost rolled up.

AnnaMarie hurriedly put it back on from behind.

<blank>

Yes, what the hell was that light?

<blank>

The tent curtain was raised vigorously and Trevor came into the tent.

<blank>

Luke! It's bad manners to enter so abruptly!"

<blank>

Aria quickly slid her body between Suzy and Trevor, and then turned to Trevor and raised her voice.

<blank>

Oh ......, sorry ....... But! Now the light is ......, hey, what's this? No way!"

<blank>

Trevor's eyes widened when he saw Regulus cheerfully rubbing his face against Suzy.

It was unbelievable to see the horse, which was supposed to have been dying just a few minutes ago, standing up.

<blank>

I thought, "...... No way, oh! Casey! Are you okay? Can you get your body up?

<blank>

I turned to Casey Guinness, who seemed surprised to see his own body recovering as he sat up and looked at his hands.

<blank>

Is, yes ...... at all ....... No, no! Instead, I'm in better shape than before. ......

<blank>

Casey Guinness got off the bed and stood there, moving his extremities as if to check himself.

<blank>

"...... awesome ......, the quintessential AmCam ......, Class A team teaching officer! That's fantastic!!!!"

<blank>

Trevor's eyes sparkle with admiration as he turns to Irta.

<blank>

I never thought I would be able to recover so much in such a short period of time! Few people, even the elite of the Order's medical unit, are this skilled! It's wonderful! It's wonderful!

Oh, no, how about ......, you're welcome?"

<blank>

Iltar answered Trevor with a subtle shift of his eyes.

<blank>

'Oh, I knew it. It's a ...... waste not to choose to return to work ...... times when you already have this much healing power.'

'The class that derives from the Bird is a versatile job that is ripe for both recovery and attack. It's not a waste of time."

'Ha ......, yes, well, you certainly are ....... Your daughter can handle anything.

Nope!"

<blank>

Iltar and Ketty were whispering such things so that Trevor would not hear them.

<blank>

"...... Um, ............ Chief Trevor. May I?"

<blank>

Casey Guinness, sitting on the bed, begrudgingly asked Trevor.

<blank>

What's the matter, Casey? Still not feeling strong enough? You want to get some more rest and then head back to the village?"

No, no, that's not it. Are these ...... and the group leader going to ...... Irosio alone?"

<blank>

Casey Guinness, lying in bed, knew from the conversation between Trevor and Aria that they were the only reinforcements to Irosio.

<blank>

I beg your pardon, but that is too reckless. The enemy is not so naive as to think that a single team reinforcement can overturn it!"

Casey. You think we're going to die for nothing, don't you?"

<blank>

Casey nodded silently. The enemy he had just witnessed was not one that could be dealt with by five or ten more people.

If they head for it, it will be a burnout. They should not lose their strength unnecessarily. He didn't leave his people behind to let that happen.

<blank>

Seeing Casey biting his mouth with a grimace, Aria opened her mouth.

<blank>

I'm not just going in there without thinking about it. We have a secret weapon.

<blank>

Aria then looked at Irta and had her take the magical tool out of her sack.

Casey sees this and gives Aria a dubious look.

<blank>

This is a spare core for the 'large scale warding device' that I borrowed from the Temple Director."

<blank>

It is a magical tool in the shape of a disk about 40 centimeters in diameter and five centimeters thick.

At the center of the watch was a semi-spherical crystal, and smaller crystals were also embedded around the dial, like the dial of a clock.

<blank>

Only priests can activate it. The range of its effect also depends on the power of the surgeon. The head of the temple told us that our Iltar is capable of deploying a ward with a radius of one kilometer. Once the ward is in place, the impure will not be able to enter for 24 hours. What do you think? Don't you think it makes sense for us to go to Irosio with this?"

<blank>

Aria winked and explained the warding device to Casey.

<blank>

'So, then! With that, the squad leader and the battalion commander?!"

The temple director said, "If we deploy wards where the enemy layer is thick, we can purify a thousand or two thousand. We are lucky that the enemy is undead."

<blank>

Oh, wow! Mi, get everyone to ......! Get the squad leader!!!!"

<blank>

Casey looked up and sobbed. It was as if a light of hope had been lit in her eyes.

<blank>

I, Aria the Iron Wall, will hold back the enemy battalion! Once we have attracted as much of the enemy as we can, we will set up wards to entangle as much of their forces as possible, and then we will retreat from Irosio with the survivors! After that, we will retreat from Irosio with the survivors!"

<blank>

This is essentially a defense mechanism for an important village," Aria continued, explaining the plan to Casey.

Roughly, this is ......, and this warding device is the axis of the operation.

<blank>

But the real secret weapon is something else," Aria mutters in a whisper so that the two knights can't hear her, and looks at Suzy.

<blank>

<blank>

When did they prepare such a device?

Suzy asked AnnaMarie, tilting her head in a whisper.

<blank>

Before the chief gathered us at the village hall, we applied for cooperation from the temple and received these items.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to expect," Ilta told Suzy in a whisper.

The plan of operation was Augusto Dalles, the village mayor.

<blank>

To be honest, August did not believe that Suzy alone could destroy the entire enemy force.

But it will surely deal a heavy blow to the enemy group.

There, he thought, this large-scale warding device would provide a bulwark to force Howard and Conrad to retreat from the front lines.

<blank>

(Oh, well! With this, I only need to focus on helping Howard Papa! I may not have to worry about destroying nature any more than I have to!)

<blank>

Suzy, who heard this, also thought of such a thing and made a small gut-punch under her cloak.

<blank>

The rest is a race against time! We need to get to the front as soon as possible!

<blank>

Aria flipped her cloak and announced her departure. Everyone there responded with a small "Oh!

<blank>

I'm  and I'd like to ask for permission to go to the Abyss again! I am ...... and I, too, would like to ask your permission to proceed to the abyss again!

<blank>

Casey Guinness, looking at Trevor with a determined look in his eye, interrupted him.

<blank>

There are still my friends over there! I bet they are still fighting at this very moment! I am! I am not going to sit idly by in a safe place by myself! I understand that I am being selfish! However! If it is possible ......! Please, Captain Trevor! I want to ...... myself, I want to go back to that place again!

"Casey ......, you ......"

We may not be able to afford to protect you, you know?"

I don't care! I am a member of the Mobile Heavy Knights! Besides, I know where the front lines are! I can show you the closest road to ...... the path I have taken! Please ......, please, please, please! Let me show myself the way!

<blank>

Casey stood, fists clenched, bowing and pleading with Aria and Trevor.

<blank>

"But you ......, you're just now recovering from a serious wound. ...... are you sure you're okay?"

<blank>

While understanding Casey's thoughts, Trevor thought of the body and looked at Aria and Irta as if to ask them.

The two men stole a glance at Suzy without Trevor's knowledge, and Suzy gave a small nod of the head.

<blank>

I get it! ...... don't hate guys like you. We don't mind! Just make sure you show us the way!

Ah! Thank you!"

<blank>

At Aria's words, Casey again bows his head significantly.

<blank>

At the same time, Regulus began to whimper.

<blank>

What? Nah? Le, Regulus? ...... Eh? You're saying you're going, too?"

<blank>

Regulus was whining and sliding his body against Suzy.

As if she understood Regulus' words, Suzy muttered in confusion.

<blank>

It seems the horse wants to return to the Lord with her.

Wow ......, that's a horse for a head of state."

<blank>

When AnnaMarie told Trevor and Casey this, Aria happily stroked Regulus' cheek.

<blank>

You use the horse this girl rode in on! Come on! We're leaving right now!"

<blank>

Aria told Casey and left the tent with her team in tow.

<blank>

When they got out of the tent, they all straddled their horses.

Trevor and Casey mounted their horses, too, and the logistics men strapped their luggage to their horses.

Aria looked at Trevor with a "What's that? Aria looked at Trevor with a look that said, "What's that?

<blank>

The "spare" magic power storage device for mobile armors. In fact, this miniaturized version is classified by the Order of the Heavy Knights of Activation. ......

<blank>

Trevor then looks at the sack on Irta's back that contains the warding device.

Aria, seeing this, cowered her shoulders and said, "I guess it's mutual.

<blank>

<blank>

Originally, the plan was to deliver this battery after setting up a supply base at the "Black Rock" site.

Initially, there was enough room for the battery to last with it.

<blank>

But if the entire army has done maximum combat, the batteries will be severely depleted. At the front lines, they probably won't be able to fill up in time.

In order to withdraw at full force, a fully charged battery is desperately needed.

<blank>

I'm glad Casey is here. I couldn't carry all this stuff by myself, and I couldn't let anyone but the Knights carry it."

......, Trevor Squad Leader."

<blank>

Trevor looked at Casey and nodded.

Aria, watching, grinned and pouted from her horse.

<blank>

Our goal is "Black Rock"! Listen up! Cleave anyone who blocks you without mercy! All hands on deck!

<blank>

Aria barked high in the air, and everyone followed her with a rushing cry.

<blank>

Now, as the light of dawn was about to break, the war horses of Amkam roared and roared through the land and began their march into the depths of Irosio.

Thank you for reading!

We are encouraged by your buzzwords and ratings! Thank you!

<blank>

That's all for now.

I will write again and post a series.

<blank>

Perhaps the next series of posts will finish the two chapters. ...... maybe.

Yes, there are five more episodes to go in the plot, right?

But already, there are going to be a couple more episodes. ...... haha (big sweat)
