# Episode 67: Team Aria's Deployment

This concludes this round of consecutive posts.

----------------

<b>

When Suzy finished her preparations and arrived at the first outpost on time, August was waiting with the team accompanying him into the forest.

<b>

"Lady Suzy!"

"Lady, it's a pleasure to see you again."

"We've been waiting for you, miss."

"Suzy! I've been waiting for you!!"

<b>

"Aria?!"

<b>

It was the four members of "Team Aria": Millie Barrett, Keti Forest, Ilta Lindman, and Aria Blouk.

<b>

"Ms. Suzy, please act together with Team Aria from now on. Anna Mary, I'm counting on you too."

"Leave it to me, village chief."

<b>

August introduced Suzy to Team Aria and then nodded towards Anna Mary.

<b>

"Huh? Huh? Anna Mary? Huh? Why?"

"Taking care of you is my duty."

<b>

Before she knew it, Anna Mary had changed from her usual maid outfit into exploration gear.

When did she change?! Suzy was astonished.

In reality, while walking through the corridors of Amukam House, she had been quickly changed by the other maids...

<b>

The reason Suzy hadn't noticed was that her silhouette still resembled that of a maid.

Still, it seemed she thought, "Huh? Did she take off her apron?"

<b>

Anna Mary was wearing her usual maid outfit, but with boots, elbow-length gloves, and an under-corset, the three-piece set typical for exploration.

Additionally, several belts were wrapped around her waist, with multiple pouches and several knives attached.

Without a doubt, a "fighting maid" was there.

<b>

Realizing this, Suzy nearly coughed up blood but managed to maintain her composure through sheer willpower.

(Anna Mary?! No way! This is insane! A real combat maid is seriously amazing!!)

However, that inner voice was screaming.

<b>

<b>

"Ah, Anna Mary, long time no see. I look forward to working with you this time..."

"Millie, you know Anna Mary?"

<b>

Suzy, who had been internally fangirling, was brought back to reality by Millie Barrett's voice.

<b>

"Ah, y-yes! I was with Anna Mary for three years at the Miria Castle Eye boarding school."

"Nice to see you again, Millie Barrett. I'm glad to meet you again."

"Ugh?! Y-you're suddenly behind me?! D-don't scare me like that, Anna Mary!! I-I’m really scared!!"

"Oh? It's been a while since we met a classmate, yet you're so cold, Millie?"

"Eek! I-I told you! I'm scared! Scaryyy!!"

<b>

Before she knew it, Anna Mary had moved behind Millie and was tracing her fingers along Millie's neck.

Millie's face was rapidly changing colors, from red to blue.

<b>

Hmm, what kind of relationship did they have during their school days?

Suzy pondered while stroking her chin. C-could it be that there's some kind of noble fragrance?! She imagined with her own standards, flaring her nostrils.

<b>

<b>

"A precious child of the Bairos family, specialized in interpersonal combat... I have high expectations!"

"Thank you very much, Lady Aria. I am honored to receive such high expectations from the eldest daughter of the Blouk family."

"Your modesty is frightening. If possible, I would like to spar with you once."

"If it's me, I can be your opponent anytime."

<b>

For some reason, the two were chuckling and smiling at each other.

<b>

"When Aria says 'spar,' all I can think of is something lewd."

"Keti?! What do you mean by that?!!"

<b>

The tense atmosphere was suddenly broken by Aria, who wore a confident smile, starting a comedic exchange, causing Suzy to widen her eyes.

At that moment, August clapped his hands and stepped in between them.

<b>

"That's enough of the greetings. Time is limited; you know what needs to be done, right?"

<b>

"Of course!"

"I understand."

<b>

In response to August's question, Aria and Anna Mary answered.

The other three nodded silently in agreement.

<b>

Anna Mary then moved behind Suzy, saying, "Excuse me," and began tying up her hair.

<b>

"Ms. Suzy, you and Anna Mary will now enter Iroshio as members of Team Aria."

<b>

Please listen carefully, August began to speak as he stood in front of Suzy.

Suzy tilted her head, looking up at August with a puzzled expression.

<b>

"For us who live in the Amukam forest, those with power are respected and revered. Everyone in the village knows of your strength. The villagers were delighted that you chose to stay in this village and live with us."

<b>

At August's words, Aria, Ilta, Keti, Millie, and even Anna Mary nodded happily.

<b>

"We will accept you and your strength. However, what about outsiders? To them, your power will only appear as a threat. Once they realize your strength, they will either eliminate you or try to place you under their control."

<b>

August's previously gentle expression turned serious.

In response, Suzy directed a serious gaze at August.

<b>

"However, as long as you are one of us in Amukam, we will protect you from anyone!"

<b>

August placed his left hand on Suzy's shoulder and pressed his right fist against his chest, declaring strongly.

<b>

"You are now beginning your role as the 'Princess of Amukam.' This is a joy for all the villagers."

<b>

<b>

For the frontier of Amukam, what is important in inheriting a family name is not bloodline.

If someone without strength inherits the family head, the family can easily be lost, and the village itself may cease to exist.

Since ancient times, the most important thing has been "strength."

For that reason, they have always repeated the act of passing the family down to stronger individuals.

In Amukam, bloodline is not important.

What matters is the vessel that protects the people known as the "house."

Politics can be entrusted to capable and experienced individuals around them.

The banner of Amukam must always be strong and lead the people.

Otherwise, this village could easily be swallowed by Iroshio.

<b>

It is precisely because of this historical background of Amukam that Suzy was welcomed and revered by the villagers as the "Princess of Amukam."

<b>

However, the person in question was making a subtle expression, saying, "Eh? Princess? That’s... umm..."

Unbeknownst to her, August continued speaking.

<b>

"We will protect the public face of this 'princess' from now on, as well as your 'strength.'"

<b>

August's eyes were filled with determination.

Noticing this, Suzy looked back into those eyes directly.

<b>

"The knight order is a directly governed organization of the royal capital. If your strength becomes known to the knight order, it will simultaneously become known to the royal council. This must be avoided at all costs. The head of the council does not wish for this either. Your existence as a combat force is the 'secret of Amukam!'"

<b>

As August said this, Anna Mary, who had gathered Suzy's hair, draped a cloak over Suzy's body and pulled the hood down deep.

<b>

"Lady, it might be a bit hot, but excuse me. I've tied your hair so it won't be visible from the outside. Please keep the hood deep enough so that your hair color isn't discernible."

<b>

As Anna Mary placed the hood over her, Suzy looked up at Anna Mary from beneath the hood, and she smiled and nodded.

<b>

"Suzy, you took the 'Seer' class after the trial, right? From now on, you are the Wates of Team Aria. Got it?"

<b>

Suzy nodded at Aria's words.

<b>

"Ah! That's right! Please try to avoid using words as much as possible!"

<b>

"I'm sorry, Ms. Suzy, for the inconvenience. However, I believe that with your strength, you will surely bring back the head safely. And please, do not expose your full strength to the knight order."

<b>

This was to prevent a sad incident that had once occurred in this village from being repeated, August said.

Could it be about the hero legend? After all, something must have happened between the village, the hero, and the country in the past, Suzy thought upon hearing this.

<b>

Still, well, I can't really use my full strength, though, she recalled the jagged mountains and adjusted her hood deeper to avoid showing a stiff expression.

<b>

"Horses are ready. Captain Trevor has already headed towards 'The Hill of Lament,' and should be giving retreat orders to the knights remaining on the hill. Team Aria will meet up with the captain there and head towards 'Black Rock.'"

<b>

August said that a village horse without luggage should be able to reach Black Rock in about four hours.

<b>

"Ms. Suzy, please... please bring back the head... I'm counting on you!"

<b>

August knelt, took Suzy's hands with both of his, and pressed them to his forehead.

Then, as if praying, words spilled from August's lips.

Suzy quietly closed her mouth and nodded silently in agreement.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I am Aria Blouk of 'Team Aria.'"

"I am Luke Trevor, captain of the 12th Mobile Heavy Cavalry Unit, 7th Squad. You can just call me Luke."

"I can just call you Aria too. Nice to meet you."

"Likewise, nice to meet you! I hear you already have a 'Grade' at such a young age? Impressive!"

"Starting next month, but... so? Are you all set already?"

<b>

Aria and Trevor were exchanging greetings with a handshake at the camp on the hill as the sky began to brighten.

<b>

Around them, the knight order was folding up the camp and preparing for retreat.

In exchange, members of the Amukam Guard were bringing in barriers and starting to prepare for a protective fence.

There were about a dozen members of the guard here. They were the ones who had come ahead to 'The Hill of Lament' as Trevor's escort.

In turn, the knight order was preparing to return to the village.

<b>

"Yeah, we should be able to retreat in less than 30 minutes... but sorry, could you come over to that tent for a moment? If there's something we can borrow, I’d like your help."

<b>

Trevor said this and took Aria towards the tent that was still set up in front of them.

<b>

Watching them from the horses, the members of "Team Aria" had gathered together.

Everyone was wearing cloaks and had their hoods pulled down deep.

<b>

"Hey? Miss..."

<b>

Ilta quietly spoke to Suzy.

Suzy looked up at Ilta from beneath her hood, saying, "Hmm?"

<b>

"Miss, you chose the 'Wates' class for your initial class, right?"

<b>

Suzy nodded in the hood.

<b>

"What about after that? What class will you choose after advancing and engraving the spirit seal?"

<b>

Ilta asked further, "Have you already decided?"

Suzy tilted her head, pretending to think, and placed her index finger on her chin...

<b>

"Hmm... Bard?"

"Just as I thought! Miss!"

<b>

At Suzy's words, Keti Forest made a small fist pump.

<b>

"…Huh, I knew it..."

<b>

Ilta let out a sigh for some reason.

Seeing this, Suzy tilted her head again, asking, "Hmm? Why?"

<b>

"Ilta!! Come here for a moment!!"

<b>

At that moment, Aria's voice echoed from the tent.

"What is it?" Everyone moved towards the tent and entered as invited.

<b>

The tent was surprisingly large, illuminated by a lamp, and inside were Trevor and Aria, along with a member of the logistics team who seemed to be taking care of someone lying on a simple bed.

<b>

Then Suzy noticed a partitioned area beyond the simple bed.

She sensed something familiar on that side facing outside.

Suzy felt a familiar presence and peeked beyond the partition.

<b>

"Regulus?!"

<b>

Suzy exclaimed involuntarily.

There, without a doubt, was Howard's beloved horse, Regulus, from the Cloud family.

<b>

Regulus lay on a blanket spread on the ground, covered in bandages and large gauzes, but it seemed he was bleeding heavily, and his breathing was very rough, clearly in distress.

Suzy instinctively sat beside Regulus and placed her hand on his body.

Regulus seemed to notice Suzy and slightly moved his face towards her.

<b>

"Do you know this horse?"

<b>

Trevor asked, observing Suzy's reaction.

<b>

"…Yes, this is the horse I often took care of..."

<b>

Anna Mary stepped in between Suzy and Trevor, still hiding her face with her hood.

<b>

"I see, I heard this was the lord's horse..."

"…Yes, he loves animals..."

"…I see, in any case, I'm glad someone who knows this horse is here. As you can see, this horse doesn't have much time left... I'm glad I could let him meet someone he knows one last time..."

<b>

Trevor's words made those present relax, as he did not pursue the relationship between Suzy and Regulus any further.

<b>

"…Is there any healing for this horse?"

<b>

Ilta asked Trevor.

In response, Trevor shook his head quietly.

<b>

"Unfortunately, there aren't any healers here capable of healing such a large animal. Casey, who is lying next to him, was able to close his large wounds, but he hasn't fully recovered..."

<b>

Trevor looked regretfully between Regulus and Casey Guinness, who was lying on the bed.

<b>

"Casey won't be able to return to the village in this condition. So, I thought I could ask Team Aria's healer for recovery..."

<b>

Ilta exchanged glances with Aria and nodded.

<b>

"I understand, leave it to me. But I want to concentrate, so please have non-members step outside."

"Got it! Will you do it for us? Thank you!! Just stay outside, right? Understood! We'll wait outside, please take care of Casey!!"

<b>

With that, Trevor took the logistics team member with him and bowed to Ilta before exiting the tent.

Squatting down, Suzy was stroking Regulus while glancing at Ilta and spoke.

<b>

"…Ilta, may I... do it?"

"I understand, miss. I thought you would say that, so I had them step outside... You want to heal this horse, right?"

<b>

Suzy looked up at Ilta and nodded.

<b>

"Thank you, Ilta."

<b>

After smiling at Ilta, Suzy slowly used her skill on Regulus and Casey Guinness.

<b>

<b>

≪Vitality Release≫

A skill of Suzy's divine rank recovery class, "Great Wiseman."

It fully recovers the HP and MP of allies around her.

Any surplus from HP recovery also restores stamina, and for several minutes, HP continues to recover automatically.

<b>

A ripple of light spread from Suzy.

At the same time, pillars of light rose from Casey Guinness and Regulus, healing their injured parts and restoring their stamina.

<b>

When the pillars of light disappeared, Regulus immediately stood up and began to neigh. It seemed he understood that he had been healed by Suzy.

He then rubbed his nose against Suzy's face and started licking her.

<b>

"R-Regulus! W-wait... I-I get it... that tickles... fuhh!"

<b>

Regulus's tongue was licking so vigorously that it nearly pulled Suzy's hood off.

In a panic, Anna Mary quickly adjusted the hood from behind.

<b>

"W-what was that light?!!"

<b>

The tent flap was suddenly lifted, and Trevor entered the tent.

<b>

"Luke! It's rude to suddenly enter like that!!"

<b>

Aria quickly slipped her body between Suzy and Trevor, raising her voice at him.

<b>

"Ah... I'm sorry... But that light... n-no, what is this? No way!"

<b>

Trevor's eyes widened as he saw Regulus happily rubbing his face against Suzy.

He couldn't believe that the horse, which had been on the verge of death just moments ago, was now standing.

<b>

"…No way, ah! Casey! Are you okay?! Can you get up?!!"

<b>

Looking at Casey Guinness, he too was sitting up, surprised to see his own hands and realizing that his body was recovering.

<b>

"Y-yes... completely... I-I mean! I'm feeling even better than before..."

<b>

Casey Guinness got off the bed and began to move his limbs as if checking his body.

<b>

"…Incredible... as expected of Amukam's... A-class team commander! Wonderful!!"

<b>

Trevor's eyes sparkled as he praised Ilta.

<b>

"To recover this much in such a short time! There are hardly any elite members of the knight order with such ability! Amazing! Truly amazing!!"

"Ah, no... um... you're welcome?"

<b>

Ilta answered Trevor while subtly shifting her gaze.

<b>

『Ah, as I thought. With such healing power already possessed, not choosing a recovery class... what a waste.』

『The classes derived from Bard are versatile, excelling in both recovery and attack. Not a waste at all.』

『Huh... I see, well, that's true... Miss can do anything, after all.』

『Mm!』

<b>

Ilta and Keti whispered to each other, making sure Trevor couldn't hear.

<b>

"Um, …Captain Trevor, may I ask something?"

<b>

Casey Guinness, sitting on the bed, hesitantly asked Trevor.

<b>

"What is it, Casey? Are you still worried about your stamina? Do you want to rest a bit longer before heading to the village?"

"No, that's not it, Captain. Um... are you and these people going to Iroshio alone?"

<b>

Casey Guinness had heard from Trevor and Aria's conversation that they were the only reinforcements heading to Iroshio.

<b>

"With all due respect, that's far too reckless. A single team's reinforcements won't be enough to change the enemy's strength!"

"Casey. Do you think we're going to our deaths?"

<b>

Casey nodded silently. He had witnessed that the enemy was not someone who could be dealt with just by increasing their numbers by five or ten.

Even if they went, it would be like throwing water on a hot stone. He shouldn't lose unnecessary strength. He hadn't left his comrades behind for that.

<b>

Seeing Casey biting his lip, Aria spoke up.

<b>

"Don't worry, we're not just charging in without a plan. We have a 'secret weapon' prepared!"

<b>

As Aria said this, she glanced at Ilta, who took out a magical tool from her backpack.

Seeing this, Casey looked at Aria with a puzzled expression.

<b>

"This is a spare core of a 'large-scale barrier device' that I borrowed from the temple chief."

<b>

It was a disk-shaped magical tool about 40 centimeters in diameter and about 5 centimeters thick.

In the center was a hemispherical crystal embedded, and smaller crystals were embedded around the edge, resembling the numbers on a clock face.

<b>

"Only a priest can activate this. And the effective range depends on the caster's ability. The temple chief said that Ilta can deploy a barrier with a radius of 1 kilometer. Once the barrier is set, no impure beings can enter for 24 hours. What do you think? Don't you think it's meaningful for us to head to Iroshio with this?"

<b>

Aria explained the barrier device to Casey with a wink.

<b>

"S-so! If we use that, can the captain and the squad leader...?!"

"If we deploy the barrier in a densely packed area of enemies, the temple chief said we could purify a thousand or two thousand. It's fortunate that the enemies are undead."

<b>

"Ooh!! We can save everyone...! The captain!!"

<b>

Casey's face lit up with hope as he raised his head, tears welling up in his eyes.

<b>

"I, the 'Iron Wall Aria,' will hold down the enemy's battalion! Once I've drawn them in as much as possible, I'll set up the barrier and catch as many enemy forces as I can! After that, we'll retreat from Iroshio with the survivors!"

<b>

While explaining the operation to Casey, Aria continued, saying that this was an important village defense secret.

Roughly speaking, this barrier device would be the axis of the operation.

<b>

However, the real secret weapon is something else, Aria whispered quietly so that the two knights wouldn't hear, sending a glance at Suzy.

<b>

<b>

When did they prepare such a device?

Suzy tilted her head slightly, whispering to Anna Mary.

<b>

『The village chief gathered us at the outpost before asking for cooperation from the temple and borrowed this.』

<b>

Ilta informed Suzy in a low voice.

The operation was planned by village chief August Dales.

<b>

To be honest, August didn't believe that Suzy alone could annihilate all enemy forces.

However, it was certain that she would deal a significant blow to the enemy group.

He thought that using this large-scale barrier device would serve as a wall to withdraw Howard and Conrad from the front lines.

<b>

(I see! With this, I can focus solely on helping Papa Howard! I might not need to worry about causing unnecessary environmental destruction!)

<b>

Hearing this, Suzy thought about it and made a small fist pump under her cloak.

<b>

"Now it's a race against time! We must head to the front lines as soon as possible!!"

<b>

Aria declared, flipping her cloak. Everyone responded with a small "yeah."

<b>

"Uh, Captain Trevor! I... I would like to request permission to advance into the Abyss again!!"

<b>

At that moment, Casey Guinness, with a determined look, interrupted Trevor.

<b>

"There are still comrades there! They must still be fighting at this very moment!! I refuse to sit back and relax in a safe place alone!! I understand I'm being selfish! But if possible...!! Please, Captain Trevor! Let me... let me go back to that place!!"

"Casey... you..."

"We might not have the luxury to protect you!"

"I don't mind! I'm still a member of the Mobile Heavy Cavalry! Besides, I know the way to the front lines! I can guide you along the path I took... the closest route! Please... please let me guide you!!"

<b>

Casey stood, clenching his fists, bowing his head and pleading with Aria and Trevor.

<b>

"But you... you've just recovered from serious injuries... are you really okay?"

<b>

Understanding Casey's feelings, Trevor looked at Aria and Ilta, seeking their opinions.

The two exchanged glances with Suzy, who nodded slightly.

<b>

"Alright! I don't dislike someone like you. We don't mind! Count on you to guide us!"

"Ah! Thank you very much!!"

<b>

At Aria's words, Casey bowed deeply again.

<b>

At the same time, Regulus began to neigh.

<b>

"Huh? W-what? R-Regulus? ...Huh? Is he saying he wants to go too?"

<b>

Regulus was nuzzling against Suzy while neighing.

As if understanding Regulus's words, Suzy murmured in confusion.

<b>

"It seems this horse also wants to return to its master with this child."

"Oh... as expected of the lord's horse."

<b>

When Anna Mary conveyed this to Trevor and Casey, Aria happily stroked Regulus's cheek.

<b>

"Use the horse this child rode! Now! We will depart immediately!"

<b>

Aria told Casey this and led the team out of the tent.

<b>

As they exited the tent, everyone mounted their horses.

Trevor and Casey also got on their respective horses, and a logistics team member tied their gear to the horses.

When Aria looked at Trevor with a questioning expression, he replied,

<b>

"This is a spare 'magic power storage device' for the mobile armor. In reality, this compact version is treated as a confidential item of the Mobile Heavy Cavalry..."

<b>

Saying this, Trevor glanced at the backpack containing the barrier device that Ilta was carrying.

Seeing that, Aria shrugged, thinking, "We're in the same boat."

<b>

<b>

Originally, the plan was to set up a supply base at 'Black Rock' and then deliver this battery.

Initially, there was enough leeway to hold the battery.

<b>

However, after the maximum battle with the entire army, the battery would deplete rapidly. It was likely that recharging wouldn't keep up at the front lines.

To retreat at full strength, a fully charged battery was absolutely necessary.

<b>

"Honestly, I'm glad Casey came. Since this is something that can't be entrusted to anyone outside the knight order, I couldn't carry it all alone."

"…Captain Trevor."

<b>

Trevor nodded at Casey.

Seeing this, Aria grinned and raised her voice from her horse.

<b>

"Our destination is 'Black Rock'! Listen up! Anyone who stands in our way will be mercilessly cut down!! All units, deploy!!"

<b>

Aria shouted loudly, and everyone followed suit, raising their voices.

<b>

Now, as the dawn light began to break, the warhorses of Amukam neighed, shaking the ground, and began their advance into the depths of Iroshio.

Thank you for reading.

Bookmarks and evaluations are encouraging! Thank you!!

<b>

This is where I will end it for now.

I will write more and post consecutively.

<b>

I believe the next consecutive post will conclude Chapter 2... probably.

Well, according to the plot, there are still five more episodes, right?

But it seems like two or three more episodes will likely be added... uahaha (sweat)
