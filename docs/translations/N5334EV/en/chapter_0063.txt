# Chapter 58: The Relief of Magritte Goche

The knight order arrived three days later, on the afternoon of the 25th of the second month of the blue moon.

<b>

<b>

<b>

That day, when I went to Amkam House to meet Papa Howard and the others.

I was told that both Papa and Mama Sonia were busy and couldn't return home.

And it wasn't just Mama Sonia; Ms. Elrose was also busy.

Due to the emergency, the skills of a former housekeeper were needed.

<b>

As a result, it was decided that I would be home alone for a while!

Well, Anna Mary is here too, but...

However! With her current housekeeping abilities, Ms. Elrose concluded that it was concerning for just the two of us to be left alone!

<b>

For the time being, Mama Sonia said she would have the bedroom at Amkam House ready for us to use by today, so starting tomorrow, we should sleep here.

<b>

So, for just one night, I would be spending time alone with Anna Mary.

When Anna Mary heard that, she seemed somewhat happy, didn’t she?

<b>

But then, Mia cheerfully raised her hand and said, "Please let me take care of you at my house tonight!"

Mama Sonia clapped her hands in agreement, saying, "That would make me feel relieved!"

<b>

And so, that night, I ended up sinking into Mia's bed... nya.

But when Anna Mary heard we were staying at Mia's house, she looked somewhat despairing, but was it just my imagination...?

<b>

<b>

Starting the next day, I began living at Amkam House, but the room assigned to me was always so large that it made me uneasy.

<b>

The bed was a king size with a canopy.

Well, it was cute with its light pink lace, so that was fine... I guess.

<b>

In general, the princess-like setup here is quite overwhelming!

It almost makes me feel like I'm mistakenly thinking I'm a well-off young lady!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

During my stay at Amkam House, I ended up helping everyone out.

<b>

The preparations inside Amkam House were being handled by the maids, led by Mama Sonia, who were all working together.

What I could do was take care of the workers who were doing the construction.

<b>

Specifically, I would serve meals and clean up, helping out with the dining situation.

After all, Amkam doesn’t have a large dining hall!

There aren’t facilities here to quickly satisfy the stomachs of all the craftsmen currently present!

<b>

Since we couldn't fit everyone in the great hall of Amkam House...

We managed to provide meals made in the kitchen.

So, a simple dining area was set up.

That’s where the workers would have their meals.

<b>

However, the maids were so busy with chores inside Amkam House that they had little time to come here.

That’s why I was running around in this dining area!

<b>

<b>

I mean, taking orders, delivering food, and clearing away finished dishes. It’s just normal serving work! I’ve never done it before... but somehow I’m managing!!

<b>

But, wearing a big apron, a triangular headscarf on my head, and rolling up my sleeves while running around with a tray!

This is already a proper "diner waitress," right?!

<b>

Sometimes there are older men who try to pat my bottom!

But I quickly kick those kinds of people away, so it’s not a problem! No problem at all?!

<b>

<b>

In these three days, I’ve become quite friendly with Ms. Magritte and the others.

They always have their meals here, so we naturally end up talking.

We also often chatted when we had free time or during breaks.

<b>

Ms. Magritte is indeed a reliable older sister.

She efficiently organizes meetings to advance the work and remembers the names of each craftsman, making it clear that she’s a responsible leader who pays attention to the details.

<b>

Mr. Simon is just as he appears, a calm and capable deputy.

He accurately conveys Ms. Magritte's instructions to those around him and fills in the gaps.

It’s because of people like him that Ms. Magritte can work with peace of mind.

<b>

Ms. Lysa is... just so busy.

She seems to know what to do next before being told and is already moving ahead... She can do the work, but she always seems flustered...

Ms. Magritte and Mr. Simon often tell her to "calm down first," but she remains hurried.

However, her cute smile is so charming... that adorable smile is truly healing. She's the idol of the site, you know?!

<b>

<b>

But really! I wish they would stop calling me "Princess"!

I’m not a princess!

No matter how much I say it, neither Ms. Magritte nor Ms. Lysa will stop.

Thanks to that, before I knew it, the older men on site started calling me "Princess" too!

While serving in the dining area.

<b>

"Princess! Three lunches over here!"

"Make this one a large serving, Princess!"

<b>

I get called like that all the time!

I keep saying "Stop!" while my face turns red, but everyone just grins and doesn’t stop... What is this blame?!

How did it come to this?!!

<b>

<b>

Well, with all that said, I’ve become friendly with the three members of the knight order.

According to Ms. Lysa, the members of the main knight order who will be arriving soon are all friendly and good people, and the commander leading them is said to be a strict and cool, distinguished older gentleman.

Since this will be my first time seeing a full-fledged knight order, I’m looking forward to meeting everyone.

<b>

<b>

By the way, Ms. Magritte said she and Mr. Ryder were in the same class.

Apparently, when they first joined the knight order, they were assigned to the western frontier and spent two years together in the same unit.

Since Mr. Ryder was unusually promoted to the royal capital, they hadn’t seen each other since, and she was looking forward to seeing him again after such a long time.

<b>

"I see... Mr. Ryder went west, did he? I see... I’m glad... he can finally move forward..."

<b>

When I told Ms. Magritte that Mr. Ryder had headed west at the beginning of the year, she lowered her gaze, smiled a little in relief, and quietly murmured those words.

<b>

...Oh dear, Mr. Ryder, making such a beautiful woman show such an expression...

<b>

<b>

On the third day of serving, the lunchtime rush had settled down, so I ended up having a late lunch with Ms. Magritte and the other two.

While having lunch, Ms. Magritte shared stories about Mr. Ryder from the past.

<b>

To become a full-fledged knight, it seems one must graduate from the knight class in high school and undergo a two-year training period. However, Mr. Ryder was exempted from that and entered the knight order as if he had skipped a grade.

So, even though he was younger than the others, he attracted everyone's attention.

But apparently, he was quite cheeky.

<b>

"At first, since he was the only one younger, I tried to look out for him... but he was strangely hard to approach... On top of that, he was unfriendly! His gaze was fierce, and he wouldn’t listen to others!! Eventually, he started to earn resentment among his peers, but he was the best with a sword, incredibly strong... I never managed to win against him. I was completely outmatched..."

<b>

Mr. Ryder does have a fierce look, doesn’t he? If he had that frown back then, he might have been seen as a scary person... But unfriendly? I can’t really imagine that now.

<b>

"Buuhfabibibobebobobobobobob? Binbibabebebin!!"

<b>

Ms. Lysa is stuffing her mouth full and saying something. I can’t understand what she’s saying?!

Mr. Simon gave her a light smack on the back of her head, telling her not to talk with her mouth full.

With her cheeks puffed out, Ms. Lysa...

Is she a squirrel?! How cute!

<b>

"When it came to battle, he would be the first to charge in and take down the most enemies... Especially when a certain type of monster appeared, his fighting style was nothing short of spectacular... It’s what you would call overwhelming..."

"But when his allies were in danger, he would always rush to help, never backing down, no matter how injured he was... I’ve been saved by him more than once."

"Eventually, the team members began to recognize him, but... I’ve never seen him smile even once..."

<b>

Ms. Magritte spoke sadly.

<b>

...Mr. Ryder, making Ms. Magritte show such an expression...

<b>

"But now, I hear he smiles often? I’m glad... really. But I still wanted to see him at least once..."

<b>

Really, what are you doing, Mr. Ryder! Seriously!!

But you know, making a woman show such an expression means he must have been doing something worthwhile, right?

After all, he’s a Haggard man, isn’t he?

I see...

<b>

So that’s how it is, Mr. Ryder. Hmm, I see... wow...

<b>

Just then, a government official from the dining hall rushed in, panting.

It seems two of Ms. Magritte's subordinates who were left with the main unit have arrived.

<b>

They received word that the main knight order had departed from Coop Town in the early afternoon.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Suzie, you look great, it suits you well."

"Yes, our princess is something to be proud of anywhere."

<b>

Nyu... even Papa Howard is calling me princess...

<b>

Right now, we were waiting in formal attire at the front entrance of Amkam House to welcome the investigation delegation, alongside Papa Howard and Mama Sonia.

Mama Sonia was wearing white, and I was in an ice green afternoon dress.

My hair was tied back in a small bun, and Anna Mary had lightly applied blush on me, making me feel a bit embarrassed.

<b>

Looking up at Mama Sonia beside me, she had her hair elegantly styled and looked beautiful.

I couldn’t help but let out a sigh of admiration.

<b>

Noticing my sigh, Mama Sonia looked down at me and smiled, saying, "You look cute, Suzie."

That made me feel embarrassed again, and I replied softly, "Thank you," while looking down.

<b>

<b>

The road from Coop Town to Amkam passes along the east side of Amkam House and connects to the first outpost.

This is the main street of Amkam, which is also used during the harvest festival.

<b>

The delegation had already crossed the village boundary and was heading this way. They were about a kilometer away, I think?

When I explored, it seemed there were about 100 people in the delegation. They would need accommodation.

<b>

Eventually, a group appeared over the hill, led by several horsemen,

and a particularly eye-catching luxurious carriage came into view.

Following that, horsemen and carriages began to appear one after another from behind the small hill.

<b>

The leading horsemen passed through the southern main gate and entered the premises. Even from here, I could hear the sound of hooves and wheels striking the ground.

<b>

The line of horses that had been leading split to the sides, allowing the carriage to move to the front. The carriage proceeded directly to the front and came to a stop at the entrance.

<b>

The stopped carriage was a box-shaped carriage made of ebony, adorned with gold decorations that sparkled annoyingly.

The other carriages were all simple and practical, but this one was just overly flashy.

<b>

In front of that flashy carriage, Mayor Dulles and the members of the three prominent families were waiting, dressed in formal attire they usually didn’t wear.

After the carriage stopped, it took its time opening the extravagant door, almost as if to tease us.

<b>

Eventually, a person with a notably large nose and a protruding belly, exuding an imposing demeanor, stepped out.

<b>

Hmm? Is this person the commander? They look nothing like the image I had in mind...

<b>

I could see Mr. August greeting that person and exchanging words.

The other person seemed to listen to Mr. August's greeting with an arrogant attitude. It felt rather unpleasant.

<b>

Following that person, a dark-skinned man with a nervous-looking gaze stepped down and exchanged greetings with Mr. August and the others.

<b>

Then, after that, several women dressed in extravagant dresses came down?! Huh? Are they accompanying them to work?!

N-no, could they be the wives of the two? That’s it, right? There’s no way they would bring women along... right?

<b>

<b>

While I was thinking about that, the large-nosed man was guided by Mr. August to Papa Howard.

<b>

"I am Cameron Fourier, the 'Deputy Director of the Northern Disaster Response Committee, Deipara Investigation Delegation.' Thank you, Lord Howard Cloud, for graciously accepting our unreasonable request."

<b>

"I am Howard Cloud of Amkam. Thank you for coming all the way here, Mr. Fourier. First, please take your time to rest from your long journey and regain your strength. We will do our best to assist you. You can relax here."

<b>

"Thank you very much. I appreciate your thoughtfulness."

<b>

After the greetings between Papa Howard and Mr. Fourier were completed, Mama Sonia and I were introduced and allowed to greet him as well.

Thanks to Ms. Elrose and Anna Mary, who had been training me well, I think I managed to greet him properly.

<b>

...But I felt like I was being looked at with eyes that seemed to cling to every part of my body.

It was the first time I had been looked at like that, and it made me feel quite uncomfortable.

<b>

After that, I think I exchanged greetings with a few other people, who I believe were some scholars... but I felt so uneasy that I don’t remember well.

<b>

After watching Papa Howard and the others guide the investigation delegation into Amkam House, I clung to Mama Sonia's skirt.

<b>

Mama Sonia gently rubbed my back for a while.

<b>

----------------

"Hey, Irvin! Can I ask you something?!"

"What is it, Bibi? Why the sudden formality?"

"Since a while ago...! Is that a bangle attached to the strap of your shoulder bag?!"

"Huh? Oh, yeah."

"Wow...! Can I ask why you’re wearing it?!"

"Huh? I was told it was something I made during practice, so I should wear it since it would be a shame to put it away..."

"Wow...! By the way, what about the bangle I gave you?!"

"Huh? Look, I’m wearing it on my left hand, see? Hehe."

"…Do you know what the meaning of a bangle is?!"

"I-I know! Of course I do!! U-um... during the second month’s harvest festival, a girl gives it to someone she likes... and the guy who accepts those feelings wears it on his left arm... Ah! Saying it again makes me super embarrassed!!"

"…Well, that’s true! As long as you understand! Good! As long as you understand!!"

"…Y-yeah..."

"…So, who did you get it from?!"

"Huh? Mary gave it to me. She said it was for practice."

"Wow...! But there are four in total, right?!"

"Ah! The others are from Gloria, Irma, and Jarnis. They all came running with it saying, 'I’m giving this to Irvin!' Cute, right?"

"Wow...! Did you... accept them honestly?!"

"Huh? I mean, we’re kids, right? They just wanted to mimic the older girls and give them to someone."

"………Haaahhh～～～!"

"W-what’s with that huge sigh?!!"

"N-no?! It’s fine! Right! Irvin is a Haggard man, after all!"

"Huh? Y-yeah! I’m a Haggard man!!"

"That’s right...! You’re a Haggard man...! It can’t be helped...! Haaahhh～～～…!"

"W-what’s going on? What the heck?!!"

"Haaahhh～～～～………!"
