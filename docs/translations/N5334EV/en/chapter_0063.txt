# 58 Magritte Gauche's Relief

The knights arrived three days later, on the afternoon of the 25th of the 2 ao month.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I went to the Amcam House that day to meet the Howard Papas.

I was told that my dad, as well as my mom Sonia, were too busy to go back home.

And it's not just Mama Sonia, it's Ms. Elrose, too.

The emergency situation called for the skills of a former housekeeper.

<blank>

As a result, I had to stay home alone for a while! I was left alone in the house for a while!

Well, AnnaMarie is there too....

However! Her housekeeping skills are not adequate for the two of us to be away from home alone at the moment! Ms. Elrose made the following observation.

<blank>

Sonia told us that she would have the bedrooms at Amcam House ready for use by the end of the day, and that we should start sleeping here from tomorrow.

<blank>

So, for one night tonight, I will be alone with AnnaMarie.

I think AnnaMarie seemed kind of happy to hear that, don't you?

<blank>

But there, let me take care of you at home tonight! and Mia came cheerfully raising her hand.

Sonia-mama was relieved to hear Mia's suggestion!　and she agreed by clapping her hands on her chest.

<blank>

So that night, I ended up sinking into Mia's bed. ......

But when AnnaMarie heard that we were going to stay at Mia's house, she looked a little despairing, but was it just my imagination...? I don't know...?

<blank>

<blank>

From the next day, I started living in Amcome House, but the room assigned to me was always too big and I felt uncomfortable.

<blank>

The bed is also king-sized and even has a canopy.

Well, it's okay because it's pretty with pale pink lace....

<blank>

In general, the princess-like atmosphere of this place is very much like a princess!

It's almost as if she thinks she's a good toddler girl!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, I decided to help out while I was staying at the AMCAM House.

<blank>

All the maids, including Mama Sonia, are working on the preparations in the Amcam House.

All I can do is take care of the people who are doing the construction.

<blank>

Specifically, serving and cleaning up meals and taking care of such dining situations.

After all, there is no big restaurant in AMCAM!

There are not enough facilities here to quickly satisfy the stomachs of all the artisans present!

<blank>

We can't let everyone into the hall in the AMCAM house, you know....

But we can manage to cover our expenses with the meals we make in the kitchen....

Therefore, a simple cafeteria was built.

So the construction crews were asked to eat.

<blank>

However, the maids are so occupied with the chores in the AMCAM house that there is little to do for them.

That is why I am running around in the cafeteria here!

<blank>

<blank>

I take orders, serve the food, and put away the dishes when it's done. It's a normal waiter's job! I've never done it before...but I'm doing it!

<blank>

But I put on a big apron, put a triangle hood over my head, rolled up my sleeves, and ran around with a tray!

This is already a great "lady of a popular diner," isn't it?

<blank>

Sometimes there are old men who try to pet my butt!

I don't have a problem with people who do, though, because I promptly kick them to the curb! No problem, right?

<blank>

<blank>

Over the past three days, I have gotten to know Mr. Magritte and the others quite well.

They always take it to Koch when they eat. I naturally talk to them.

We often talked when our hands were free or when we were taking a break.

<blank>

Ms. Magritte was, after all, a sissy sister.

I could tell that he was in charge of a unit that was attentive to the smallest of details.

<blank>

Mr. Djimon, as you can already see, is a calm and excellent second-in-command.

He accurately communicates Mr. Magritte's instructions to those around him and fills in the missing pieces.

With people like this, Mr. Magritte must be able to work with peace of mind.

<blank>

Raisa is in a hurry to ...... rabbit.

They know what they need to do next before they are told, and they are already on their way... They may be good at their jobs, but they always seem to be on their toes....

Mr. Magritte and Mr. Djimon are always telling me to 'calm down first'...but I'm still in a hurry.

But her smile is so cute...I can't help but be soothed by that kaaiii smile. She is already an idol at the site!

<blank>

<blank>

Demonstration! I really don't want you to call me 'Princess', do you?

Princess Chigaukara!

And no matter how much I said, neither Mr. Magritte nor Raisa would stop me.

Thanks to this, before I knew it, the old men on site had started calling me "Himesama" or "Hime-sama!

He said he was serving in the cafeteria.

<blank>

Himesummer! Three lunches over here, please!"

I'm having a big one over here! Himesama!"

<blank>

I was called like that all the time!

Stop it! I said it over and over again with my face burning, but they wouldn't stop smiling at me.... What kind of blame is this?

What's wrong with you?

<blank>

<blank>

Well, that's how I've been getting along with the three members of the knighthood.

According to Raisa-san, the main body of the knights who will be coming from now on are all friendly and nice people, and the battalion commander who leads them is a strict, cool, and austere man.

Of course, this is the first time for me to see a full-fledged knighthood, so I am looking forward to meeting you all.

<blank>

<blank>

By the way, Mr. Magritte said that he and Mr. Ryder are in the same class.

He said that his first assignment after joining the Order was to the western frontier, where he had spent two years together in the same unit.

He had not seen Mr. Ryder since he was assigned to King's Landing due to his exceptional career advancement, so he was looking forward to seeing him for the first time in a long time.

<blank>

'I see... so the rider headed west? I see.... Good..., he can finally proceed. ......"

<blank>

When I told him that Mr. Ryder had headed west at the beginning of the year, Mr. Magritte cast down his eyes, smiled a little in a reassuring way, and said in a quiet, murmuring way.

<blank>

I can't believe you, Mr. Ryder, made such a beautiful woman look like this....

<blank>

<blank>

On my third day as a waiter, the lunchtime rush had died down, so I decided to have a late lunch with Magritte and the other three.

Over lunch, Magritte told me stories about Ryder's past.

<blank>

It is said that to become a regular knight, one must graduate from a high school knight class and then go through a two-year training period. However, Mr. Ryder was exempted from this requirement, and he skipped a class to join the knighthood.

So Mr. Ryder, who was the only one younger than the others, even though they were in the same class, was apparently the center of everyone's attention.

But he was cocky in every way.

<blank>

At first, I tried to pay attention to him because he's only one person older than me... but he's strangely unapproachable..." In addition, he's not very sociable! He has a bad look in his eyes and doesn't listen to people! He was the best with the sword, and he was so strong... I never beat him. I have never been able to beat him. I have never been able to beat him.

<blank>

Mr. Ryder has a hard look in his eyes.... When his eyebrows were wrinkled, I might have thought he had bad eyes.... But unsociable? I can't imagine that now.

<blank>

 Bin bibi babee babee!!!!"

<blank>

Raisa is stuffing her mouth full of food and saying, "I don't know what you're talking about! I don't know what she's saying!

Mr. Djimon told me, "Don't talk with things in your mouth!　he said, with a petch on the back of his head.

Raisa-san with both hoppes bulging roundly....

A squirrel? Isn't he cute?

<blank>

Once a battle broke out, he would go ahead of everyone else and kill more people than anyone else. Especially when a certain type of demon appears, his fighting style is one word for spectacular... I guess that's what I mean when I say he's "ghoulish." ......

But when my allies were in danger, I always rushed to their aid, never backing down, and always rescuing them no matter how badly I was hurt...I was saved more than once."

Eventually, everyone in the troop came to recognize him... but I never once saw him laugh. ......

<blank>

Mr. Magritte said sadly.

<blank>

....Mr. Ryder, you can't return this kind of face to Mr. Magritte....

<blank>

But I hear you laugh a lot now? I'm glad...really. But I still wish I could have seen you at first sight..."

<blank>

Really, what are you doing, Mr. Ryder? What are you doing, Mr. Ryder?

But, you know, if you can make a woman look like this, it means you've done something right, right?

After all, he is a Haggard man, right?

I see...

<blank>

Oh, so that's what you mean, Ryder. Hmmm, I see, hehe... ......

<blank>

Just as Mr. Magritte was muttering this, a government official appeared out of breath in the cafeteria.

Two of Mr. Magritte's men that he left behind in the main office have just arrived.

<blank>

It was news that the main body of the Order had left Copetown in the early afternoon.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

"Suzy, it's okay. You look great."

Ummm, I'm proud to call her my princess no matter where I send her."

<blank>

Nyuu......even Howard Papa calls her a princess....

<blank>

We were waiting in front of the main entrance of the Amcam House to welcome the research delegation, with Howard Papa and Sonia Mama in formal attire.

Mama Sonia wore a white and I wore an ice green afternoon dress.

Her hair was pulled back in a small bun, and she was a little embarrassed that AnnaMarie was even wearing a thin layer of rouge.

<blank>

Looking up at Sonia's mother next to me, I saw that she was still beautiful with her hair tied up neatly.

I can't help but let out a sigh of relief.

<blank>

Mama Sonia noticed my sigh, looked down at me, smiled, and complimented me on how pretty I was, Susie.

I was still embarrassed and looked down with a small "thank you.

<blank>

<blank>

The road from Copetown to Amcam runs through the east side of Amcam House and leads to the One's Tsumesho.

This is the main street of Amkam, which is also used for harvest festivals.

<blank>

The mission has already crossed the village boundary and is coming this way. I'd say we're about a kilometer away.

If you explore in search, there are about 100 people in the delegation. This would require accommodations, right?

<blank>

Eventually, we saw a group of people coming this way over the hillside.

An eye-catching, luxurious carriage appears, led by a dozen horsemen.

Following them, horsemen and carriages appear one after another from behind the knoll.

<blank>

The lead cavalryman passed through the main southern gate and entered the grounds. Even here, I could hear the sound of horses and carriages kicking against the ground.

<blank>

The line of horses in front of the carriages split to the left and right, and the carriages came out to the front of the line. The carriage went straight to the front and pulled up in front of the entrance.

<blank>

The carriage that stopped was a box-shaped carriage made of ebony and decorated with gold everywhere, glittering to the point of depressing.

I know that all the other carriages are simple and utilitarian, but this one is so gaudy.

<blank>

In front of the fancy carriage, the three families, including the Dulles village chief, were waiting in front of the carriage, wearing ceremonial clothes that are not usually seen.

The carriage stopped, took its time, and then opened its fancy doors to the side, as if it were trying to hurry us along.

<blank>

Soon after, a man with a big nose and a big belly came down from inside the room.

<blank>

Hmm? Is this the Commander? It's totally different from the image I've heard.

<blank>

I notice that Mr. August greets the person and exchanges a few words with him.

The other party seemed to be listening to August's greeting in a pompous manner. I felt bad.

<blank>

A sallow man with nervous eyes comes down after him and greets August and the others.

<blank>

Furthermore, after that, women in some kind of fancy dress came down, you know? What? No way, they were going to work together?

No, no, I think it's your two wives? Yes, right? I wouldn't bring a woman with me, no matter what..., hey?

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, someone with a big nose came to Howard Papa's front, guided by Mr. August.

<blank>

My name is Cameron Fourier, Assistant Deputy Director of the Northern Deipala Task Force of the National Disaster Preparedness Committee, and I am in charge of the Deipala Survey Mission. Sir Howard Cloud. Thank you very much for accepting my request.

<blank>

I am Howard Cloud of AMCAM. Welcome, Mr. Fourier, for coming such a long way from home. First of all, you should relax from the fatigue of your long journey, and nourish your health. We will be happy to assist you as much as we can. You may spend your time in peace.

<blank>

Thank you very much. I appreciate your concern.

<blank>

After greeting Howard's father and Fourier, Sonia's mother and I were introduced and greeted.

Elrose and AnnaMarie have been training me well, so I think I was able to greet them nicely.

<blank>

Even at ......, I feel as if they were looking at me with eyes that seemed to cling to every inch of my body.

I had never seen such eyes on me before, and it made me feel very uncomfortable somehow.

<blank>

I think I also greeted some other people afterwards, some scholars I think... but I don't remember well because I didn't feel well.

<blank>

After I watched the survey team as Howard Papa and the others led them into the Amcam House and then walked in, I clutched at Sonia Mama's skirt.

<blank>

Mom Sonia gently rubbed my back for a while.

"...Hey, Irving! Can I ask you something?

"Yes, Bibi? What's up?"

"From the other day...! That thing you're wearing on your shoulder bag belt... is it a bangle by any chance?

Yeah? Yeah, yeah."

Heh...! Why are you wearing it...! Can I ask you something?

He said, "Hmm? He told me to give it to you because he made it for practice, and he didn't want you to put it away, so he asked me to wear it..."

"Heh...! ...and what about the bangle I raised?

What? You see, I'm wearing it on my left hand like this. Heh heh.

"......The meaning of a bangle..! Do you know?

'Wow, I know! That's not true! Well, you know...2...on the occasion of the Thanksgiving of Sougetsu,...a girl...sends...a...friend...whom she likes...right? ...and the guy who accepts the thought...ugh....puts it on his left arm...like this............ Ah! Once again, I'm soooo embarrassed!

I'm going to go to "......" and see if I can find anything! Yes, that's right! I know! It's okay if you know! Yeah! If you know!

"...... um, yeah..."

So...so...! It's...! Who gave you...? The one from ......?"

Hmm?" Mary gave it to me. She said, "It's for practice."

Heh..! But! There are four in all, you know?

Oh! The rest are Gloria, Irma, and Janice. All three of them brought it, cackling, 'It's for Irving! Aren't they cute?"

Heh...! Irving, that...! Did you take it in stride?

What? Because you're a kid, right? You just wanted to imitate an older girl and give it up to someone else, right?"

"......... is aaaaahhh!"

What's with that big sigh? What's with that big sigh?

No? It's okay! Yes, it is! Irving is Haggard's man!"

What? Yes, that's right! I'm a Haggard man!

I know..! It's Haggard...! It can't be helped. ...... Haa~~~......!"

What the hell? What the hell?

Hah ～～～～.........!"
