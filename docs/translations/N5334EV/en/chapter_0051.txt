# Chapter 46: Suzy Cloud's Night Training

Slowly take a deep breath and let it settle into the lower abdomen.

While confirming that "Qi" is accumulating in the abdomen, this time, exhale only.

Repeat this several times, sufficiently storing "Qi" in the lower abdomen.

Then, open the chest and circulate the warmth within the body without obstruction, recognizing the surroundings deep within the forehead.

<b>

With a light exhale, kick the ground towards the perceived target and rush forward as if flying.

Then, lightly strike the target with the palm.

<b>

The moment the palm made contact, a thunderous sound echoed, and it exploded.

The body, covered in a hard exterior, shattered and scattered, with fragments sweeping through the surrounding trees.

The forest was left in a state as if it had been blown away by shotgun blasts over a wide area.

<b>

"Umm... that was surprisingly easy to blow away! Teehee♪"

<b>

Even with her cute gesture, the devastation remained unchanged.

The forest had vanished in a fan shape from the position where she stood.

<b>

The "Forest Giant" is a giant over 5 meters tall lurking in the woods.

It swings its long arms like clubs to attack its prey.

With skin like thick bark, it is difficult to spot its figure among the trees.

Its hard skin cannot be scratched by an ordinary sword.

Yet now, Suzy had blown away all of the giants, numbering in the dozens, along with the trees.

<b>

"Ahh, when I incorporate Qi, the power becomes incredible..."

<b>

This is going too far... she thought, placing a hand on her forehead and shaking her head.

<b>

<b>

During dinner today, for some reason, her heart was disturbed, and tears wouldn't stop flowing.

Considering this, she had attempted to stabilize her mind by practicing breathing techniques and incorporating "Qi" in the forest tonight, but somehow it had resulted in destruction.

It's incomprehensible...

<b>

In any case, tonight would be the last time she came deep into the forest before the "trial."

Tomorrow, she planned to rest leisurely in her bed.

After finishing her training tonight and taking a look around, it goes without saying that she was eager to do something outdoors as usual.

(After all, it should be better for mental health to completely disrupt this area after my heart is disturbed, right?!)

She had prepared an excuse that she wasn't quite sure who it was for.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

It has already been 10 months since Suzy first set foot in this forest.

In just two more months, it will be a year.

<b>

The place she is currently in is the water source where she spent the last night of her initial survival life.

Before she knew it, she had been using this location as a base.

She had come here almost every night to test her skills and control her power.

<b>

She thought her control had improved significantly, but when she put a little force into it, this was the result.

<b>

(After all, I need to be able to suppress my fundamental power as well...)

<b>

<b>

For now, she was able to suppress the leakage of power outward, but the internal energy was still accumulating inside.

Since the internal pressure was high, it was only natural that controlling its release was difficult.

<b>

(It's more like adjusting the volume rather than just switching it ON and OFF.)

<b>

With such thoughts, she directed her consciousness inward.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Over the past 10 months, Suzy had spent her time verifying her skills.

Of course, understanding their power and precision was important, but the primary goal was to grasp the skills she could use.

<b>

After all, she was not just one character. She could use all the skills of her characters.

She started by confirming each initial skill one by one.

<b>

<b>

In the meantime, she began to have a question.

<b>

"Why can I use this skill? Why do I know it? When and how did I learn it?"

<b>

While one could say that the character learned it in a game, she now had a physical body in reality. It wasn't just data.

Then where is that knowledge stored?

<b>

At the very least, she had no memory of acquiring the skills.

She didn't understand the logic behind how she could use them.

Yet, she could use the skills.

<b>

Is there a memory area somewhere that holds the information for using skills, or rather, the skills themselves? If so, where is it?

<b>

<b>

Suzy formulated a hypothesis.

<b>

<b>

She could read the information of the target she had locked onto, meaning the recognized target.

That was a common feature in games.

She could read the name of the targeted opponent, the level difference with herself, and sometimes even more detailed information.

However, that was only in the game.

So why could she now read information about others?

<b>

And Suzy remembered a method for knowing people's names and a technique for reading their information.

<b>

"Spirit Reading" is a technique for reading the information of the ethereal body.

<b>

The ethereal body is a kind of memory medium that stores the information of the physical body in the material world.

By focusing her consciousness on the other person, wasn't she performing spirit reading on that memory medium?

Hadn't she been able to access ethereal information from the beginning?

<b>

Yes, if she could read the ethereal information of others, wouldn't she also be able to read her own ethereal information?

The hypothesis that all her skills were read from her own ethereal information.

<b>

Skills do not exist as memories in the head or body but rather as information in the ethereal body, activated by accessing it each time, allowing the body to move naturally.

Thus, there are no memories of having learned the skills in her body or head, nor does she know how to use them.

<b>

In practice, when using a skill, it is difficult to change the movement midway.

While the power can be increased or decreased by how "Qi" is infused, controlling it through the body's strength is likely impossible.

One could say it feels like the body is moving automatically.

It is hard to imagine being able to adjust to relax just right or to avoid hitting vital points.

Of course, so far, she had only been using her skills to explode or chop things up, so she hadn't tried it...

However, if she were to use her skills against a human, it would probably be impossible to adjust properly.

Naturally, she didn't want to try it on a person.

However, adjusting the power of her skills was something she wanted to experiment with.

<b>

<b>

So Suzy decided to make her body learn the skills downloaded from the ethereal body anew.

<b>

Activating the skills, the movements of the body used at that time, the shifting of weight, the muscles used, the flow of magical power and "Qi," how to store it, where to circulate it, and the amount.

She would meticulously measure, trace, and memorize all of that.

<b>

And she would repeatedly perform those body movements and ways of using her consciousness to engrain them into her body.

<b>

Instead of selecting and activating skills from her consciousness, she aimed to master the techniques she had ingrained in her body.

<b>

<b>

At first, she started with the initial skills.

"Power Smash," which delivers a strong blow with a sword or blunt weapon.

It was simply a skill to strike down hard with a weapon.

<b>

Where to store power before delivering a blow, where is the center of gravity? Where is the consciousness? When does she start moving?

What about when she strikes down? What about after the strike?

<b>

She carefully broke down, subdivided, and examined all of these aspects to trace them accurately.

<b>

At first, she traced only the form accurately.

Then she traced the movements at various speeds.

Sometimes at high speed, taking only a fraction of a second.

Other times, slowly over more than an hour.

At this stage, the skill area in her consciousness (which Suzy called it) did not react.

It did not recognize that Suzy was seeking or trying to use a skill.

<b>

Eventually, she began to align the flow of consciousness with the movements of her body.

She moved her body and the flow of consciousness together, circulating throughout her body and gathering it in the parts she wanted to use.

She repeated this process over and over.

She practiced countless times until she could do it at various speeds just as smoothly.

<b>

By the time the fifth red moon appeared, Suzy had become capable of unleashing skills using only her control over her physical body, without utilizing the skill area.

<b>

<b>

After that, she traced skills one after another.

<b>

When actually activating skills and measuring movements, she practiced tracing those movements deep in the forest, while she also practiced outside the forest.

There were times she did it in her room. She fondly remembered being scolded by Elrose for making dust fall! How disgraceful!

There were also times she practiced in the garden before dinner.

Many times, she did it in the school's training grounds.

<b>

In the training grounds, she focused on repeating the forms traced at slow speeds.

<b>

The children were all watching Suzy's repetitive practice with great interest.

When asked what she was doing, she simply replied, "Practicing forms."

<b>

<b>

The first to move was Arvin.

<b>

There are techniques to enhance the power of strikes and slashes using magical power, but that felt different. What exactly is it? he wondered.

<b>

This technique increases the power of a single strike, but it does not use magical power.

<b>

Suzy answered.

At that time, Arvin, who still couldn't cultivate magical power, was intrigued.

<b>

"Can I do it too?" he asked.

"Can you teach me?" he inquired.

<b>

Suzy thought.

The people in this world enhance their bodies and increase the power of their attacks by wrapping themselves in magical power, but the awareness of using "Qi" is weak.

In reality, many people use it unconsciously, but there are few who consciously try to control it.

<b>

She remembered that in her original world, only a few Asians, like those from China and Japan, were skilled in handling "Qi," while people in Europe did not know how to use it.

<b>

Since using magical power has become the norm here, the awareness of using "Qi" may be even less.

Conversely, since Arvin still couldn't fully use magical power, he might find it easier to recognize "Qi," and it could be a shortcut to learning magical control.

Moreover, even after he became capable of using magical power, being able to use "Qi" would enhance his abilities.

Teaching him might be interesting, she thought.

<b>

<b>

So Suzy decided to give it a try.

Starting with the initial skill "Power Smash."

<b>

Arvin learned quickly.

He memorized the form in less than three days.

Within a week, he began to grasp the shifting of weight and how to deliver it.

By the tenth day, Suzy confirmed that a faint "Qi" was wrapping around the tip of his sword.

It seemed Arvin himself felt some kind of response.

<b>

Seeing Arvin, Dana also spoke up.

<b>

"Is there no spear technique?"

<b>

"There is,"

Suzy replied.

From there, it was like an avalanche.

"What about knife techniques?" Kate asked.

"Is there no axe technique?" Lombard inquired.

Before she knew it, she was teaching all of them the practice of forms.

<b>

<b>

However, Suzy was still unaware at this time.

This would lead to the children being cheat-trained.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suzy was creating an image of storing "Qi" inside herself.

Not suppressing or pushing "Qi" down, but taking it to a different phase.

She constructed her inner space to overlap with her body and reflected and transferred it there.

It exists simultaneously there while not being there.

<b>

The current state is akin to forcibly suppressing overflowing "Qi" inside her body.

<b>

If someone who can see "Qi" were to look, they would easily see that while it isn't leaking outside, "Qi" is swirling inside.

"No matter how much you suppress it, that dense presence cannot be hidden. Hehehe..."

They might say something like that!!!

<b>

If a former player were to encounter her and say such things, it would be unbearable!

That is not what Suzy desired.

She aimed to be an inconspicuous commoner!

She must avoid such a situation at all costs!!!

<b>

Thus, Suzy layered "Qi" as if it were not there inside her.

At the same time, she attempted the technique of using "Qi" when she wanted to, in the desired amount, and in the desired part.

<b>

First, she gathered "Qi" at her fingertips. While keeping the other parts of her body thin, she concentrated on the tip of her right index finger.

Compressing it densely there.

Even more, more densely...

<b>

Eventually, she pressed her index finger with her thumb and slowly protruded it forward.

Then she flicked her finger towards the depths of the forest.

<b>

BANG! The air trembled.

<b>

The trees and earth were gouged out as if a massive cannonball had struck.

She could see the distant rocky mountain shatter.

The clouds above scattered in accordance with the trajectory...

<b>

"Ah... this is bad..."

<b>

Suzy felt a significant amount of sweat flowing down her back.

Now, approaching the hero legend!
