# 46 Suzy Cloud Night Forging

Take a deep breath and let it fall into the lower part of the mind.

This time, while confirming that Ki is accumulating in the mind, exhale only the breath.

Repeat this several times to fully accumulate Ki in the lower abdomen.

Open your chest and let the warmth from the inside of your chest spread throughout your body without stagnation, and recognize your surroundings with the back of your forehead.

<blank>

He exhales lightly, kicks the ground toward the perceived target, and approaches it at once as if he were flying.

He then lightly applied a palm strike to that opponent.

<blank>

The moment the palm was hit, it roared and it exploded.

The body, which was covered with a hard exterior, was shattered and scattered, its fragments cleaving and gouging the trees around it.

Large swaths of forest were blown away by the scattering of bullets.

<blank>

I was surprised how easily it blew up! Tehe♪"

<blank>

Cute gestures don't change the devastation.

The forest had now disappeared in a fan shape from where she stood.

<blank>

Forest Giant" - A giant over 5 meters tall lurks in the forest.

They attack their prey by swinging their long, club-like arms.

With its thick bark-like skin, it is difficult to see among the trees.

Its hard skin cannot be scratched by an ordinary sword.

But now Suzy blew away all of the giants, of which there were more than a dozen, along with the trees.

<blank>

"Ahhh, I knew that if I kneaded Ki into it, it would be very powerful..."

<blank>

This is too much..." I put my hand on my forehead and shake my head.

<blank>

<blank>

At dinner today, for some reason, I was disturbed and couldn't stop crying.

In light of this, tonight I was attempting to promote mental stability by practicing Ki in the forest through breathing exercises, but somehow this resulted in destructive activity.

Unsolvable. .......

<blank>

Either way, tonight is the last night to come deep into the woods before the "ordeal".

Tomorrow, I plan to rest in my bed in my room.

Needless to say, I'm ready to do something outdoors tonight after training and looking around, as I always do.

(After all, after all, it is better for our mental health to be disturbed on this side as well, isn't it?)

I'm not sure to whom I'm referring, but I've already prepared an excuse.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

To think, it has already been 10 months since Suzy first landed in this forest.

Two more months and it will be a year.

<blank>

Where I am now is the watering hole where I spent the last night of my first survivalist life.

Before I knew it, I was using this place as a base of operations.

He would come here almost every night to test his skills and control of his powers.

<blank>

I thought my control had improved a lot by now, but when I put a little effort into it, it's a disaster.

<blank>

(I still need to be able to suppress the underlying forces...)

<blank>

<blank>

Although the leakage of power to the outside is suppressed now, it is still circulating around the inner workings and accumulating inside.

Since the pressure inside is high, it is not surprising that it is difficult to control it outward.

<blank>

(I don't mean turning the switch on and off, I mean imagining turning the volume up and down...)

<blank>

With these thoughts in mind, I turned my attention inward.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

For the past 10-plus months, Suzy has spent time validating her skills.

The first objective was to understand its power and accuracy, of course, but also to grasp the skills available to me.

<blank>

After all, it is not just one character. You can use all the skills for all the characters you have.

He started by checking each of the initial skills one by one.

<blank>

<blank>

Eventually, she comes to ask herself one question.

<blank>

'Why is this skill useful? Why do you know it? How and when did you learn it?'

<blank>

If we say that the character learned it in a game, that's all we can say, but now it is a real body with a physical form. It is not data.

Then where is that knowledge?

<blank>

I don't recall mastering the skill, at least not for myself.

I don't even know what the logic is for using it.

But skills are available.

<blank>

Is there a memory area somewhere where the skill is used, or rather, where the information about the skill is stored? If so, where?

<blank>

<blank>

Susie had one hypothesis.

<blank>

<blank>

You can read the information of the person you have tagged, or the person you recognize.

That was commonplace in the game.

I was able to read the name of the target, the difference in level between myself and the target, and in some cases, more detailed information.

But that's because it's in the game.

So why am I now able to read information about others?

<blank>

And Suzy had a memory, a way to know people's names, a skill to read people's information.

<blank>

Reisai" is a technique for reading information from the etheric body.

<blank>

The etheric body is a storage medium, so to speak, in which information about the physical body in the material world is stored.

Was I not conducting a psychic examination of that storage medium by turning my attention to the other person?

Did I not have access to ether information from the beginning?

<blank>

Yes, if you can read the etheric information of others, you must also be reading your own etheric information, right?

The hypothesis is that all skills are also read and used from one's etheric information.

<blank>

Skills are not stored in the head or body as memories, but in the etheric body, and by accessing the information each time, skills are activated and the body moves naturally.

So neither his body nor his mind remembers learning the skill, nor does he know how to use it.

<blank>

In fact, once the skill is used, it is difficult to change the movement in the middle.

It is possible to increase or decrease the power by the way "Ki" is applied, but it is probably impossible to control the power of the body.

In other words, it is the feeling of a body moving automatically.

I don't think you can make adjustments like relaxing for good or avoiding a sharp spot to hit it.

But so far I haven't tried it because I've been using my skills to blast them or chop them up...

However, when the skill is used against humans, it is probably impossible to take it easy on them.

Of course, I don't even want to try it on a person.

However, the adjustment of skill level is a project that we would like to try.

<blank>

<blank>

So Suzy decided to try to relearn the skills she had downloaded from the etheric body into her body.

<blank>

The body movements used to activate skills, the movement of the center of gravity and the muscles used at that time. The flow of magic power and Ki, how to accumulate it, and where and how much to circulate it.

All of them are meticulously measured, traced, and memorized.

<blank>

Then, the body is made to memorize these body movements and the use of consciousness through repetition.

<blank>

To become able to use the skills that have been memorized in the body, rather than selecting and activating the skills from the consciousness.

<blank>

<blank>

At first I tried to start with the initial skills.

Power Smash," which delivers a strong blow with a sword or blunt weapon.

It's just a skill to hit the weapon hard.

<blank>

Where is your center of gravity, where is your power, where is your center of gravity, before you strike the blow? Where is your consciousness? When you start to move?

What about when you shoot down? What about after you finish shooting?

<blank>

All of them are broken down and examined in detail and traced accurately.

<blank>

At first, only the mold was traced accurately.

Then trace the movement at various speeds.

Sometimes at high speeds of fractions of a second.

At one point, it took more than an hour to yuk it up.

The subconscious skill area (as Suzy calls it) does not react at this stage.

It has not been determined that Suzy wants or is going to use her skills.

<blank>

Eventually, the flow of consciousness is combined with the movement of the body.

The body's movements and the movements of consciousness are also combined to move the whole body and collect them in the areas to be used.

This too was repeated many times.

Over and over again until you can do it the same way at various speeds.

<blank>

At the time of the 5th red moon, Suzy was able to release her skills without using the skill area, but only by controlling her own body.

<blank>

<blank>

After that, I already traced the skills from one end to the other.

<blank>

The actual activation of skills and measuring of movements was done deep in the forest, while the training of traced movements was done outside the forest.

I once did it in my room. At that time, dust was falling! It's so immodest!　I was scolded by Elrose.

Sometimes we would do it in the garden before dinner.

There was a lot to do in the school's training hall.

<blank>

In the training hall, the focus was on repetition of the traced kata with yukuri movements.

<blank>

All the children watched Suzy's repetitive exercises with great interest.

When asked what he was doing, he simply said, 'practicing kata.

<blank>

<blank>

It was Irving who made the first move.

<blank>

There are techniques that use magic power to increase the power of blows and slashes, but I don't think that is the same thing. What on earth is it? I wonder.

<blank>

This is a technique that increases the power of a blow but does not use magic.

<blank>

Suzy replied.

Irving, who at the time was not yet able to knead magic, took the bait.

<blank>

Can I do that for myself?　And.

Can't I get myself taught? And.

<blank>

Susie thinks.

People in this world are clad in magical power to strengthen their bodies and increase the power of their attacks, but they have little awareness of using "Ki".

In fact, many people use it unknowingly, but no one is consciously trying to control it.

<blank>

I remember hearing that even in the original world, only some Asian people, such as the Chinese and Japanese, were skilled in handling Ki, and that Europeans did not know how to do so.

<blank>

Since it is natural to use magic power here, there may be even less awareness of the use of "Ki".

On the other hand, it may be easier for Irving, who cannot yet use enough magic power, to recognize Ki, and it may be a quicker way to learn to control magic power.

Also, even after they are able to use magic power, they will be able to use "Ki" to raise the level of their magic power.

Would it be interesting to teach it? I thought.

<blank>

<blank>

So Suzy decided to teach.

We start with the initial skill, "Power Smash".

<blank>

Irving was a quick learner.

If it was just a mold, I learned it in less than three days.

Within a week, he began to learn how to shift the center of gravity and how to drop it.

After ten days, Suzy's eyes confirmed that the tip of the sword was clothed in a faint "Ki".

Irving himself seemed to feel some kind of response.

<blank>

Dana, who was watching Irving, also approached him.

<blank>

No spear technique?

<blank>

Yes, I do.

Susie replied.

From there it was an avalanche.

What's your knife technique? And Kate.

Don't you have an axe to grind? and Lombardo.

I found myself teaching kata practice to everyone.

<blank>

<blank>

But Suzy was not yet aware of this at the time.

This led to the development of cheats for the children, he said.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy was creating an image of "ki" being tucked away "inside".

It is not to suppress or push Ki, but to bring it to another phase.

Create your inner space so that it overlaps your body, and reflect and transfer it there.

It is there at the same time, yet it is not there.

<blank>

The current state is the same as forcibly suppressing the overflowing Ki inside the body.

<blank>

Perhaps those who can see Ki can easily see that Ki is swirling inside, even if it is not leaking outward.

Even if you suppress it, there is no way to hide the richness of the atmosphere. Kukuk..."

I might be told to do so!

<blank>

I can't stand the day when I meet an ex-player and they say something like that to me, and I'm on their radar!

That is not what Susie should want.

I aim to be a discreet commoner!

Such a situation must be avoided at all costs!

<blank>

Therefore, Suzy piles Ki on the inside as something that is not there.

At the same time, we also tried to develop a technique to use Ki when and where we wanted to use it, in the amount we wanted to use, and in the areas we wanted to use it.

<blank>

First, try to collect Ki at the fingertips. The rest of the body remains thin, concentrating only on the fingertips, the tip of the index finger of the right hand.

Compress it so thickly.

Furthermore, more and more dense....

<blank>

Eventually, his index finger was pressed down with his thumb, and it slowly protruded forward.

Then he heads deeper into the forest and plays his fingers.

<blank>

Gong!　and the atmosphere trembled.

<blank>

The trees and the earth are gouged out like the remains of a huge shell piercing the ground ahead.

I could see the rocky mountains that were far away from me pop up.

The clouds in the sky above dissipate like a ballistic trajectory....

<blank>

"Oh... this is a bad one..."

<blank>

Suzy felt sweat pouring heavily down her back.



<blank>
