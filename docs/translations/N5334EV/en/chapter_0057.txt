# Episode 52: The Flood in the Amukam Forest

Thank you for your patience.

This is the last series of posts for this year, spanning the end of the year and New Year.

<b>

I plan to post 5 episodes, but if I can manage, maybe one or two more...

...I'll do my best! pT^T

----------------

<b>

The final day of the "Trial."

The forest that day was buzzing from the morning.

<b>

In the morning, I spent my time practicing my "forms," which has become a daily routine.

Today, I tried adding a little magical power to my sword...

<b>

This is quite different from infusing "ki," and surprisingly difficult.

<b>

If I don't consciously swing the sword, the magical power flows out uncontrollably.

Is this training just right for controlling the flow of magical power?

I might want to add this to my daily training regimen when I return to the village!

<b>

Eventually, the morning passed without incident...

I noticed Aria had left the campsite during my training.

It seems she had already finished lunch.

I decided to continue my training a little longer and then have a light lunch afterward.

After the meal, I took my time to loosen my body and prepare my equipment.

<b>

I tied my hair back with a string.

During the "Trial," I had sealed my usual pigtails and had been keeping it simple with this short ponytail.

After tying my hair, I sheathed my two silver swords in their holsters and checked the knife sheath hanging around my waist.

I also confirmed the sheath knife strapped to my leg, pulling it out and checking its fit.

Then, without putting on my cloak, I stepped outside the campsite.

<b>

I have no intention of hunting here anymore.

The "Trial" ends tomorrow.

I have more than enough food.

I plan to take the leftover food back as souvenirs.

I think the fur of the horned rabbit and the crawler silk are sufficient as the results of a week of hunting.

<b>

So, what I’m heading towards now is not hunting.

It’s the subjugation of magical beasts.

<b>

As I descended from the small hill that served as our campsite, I arrived at the lowlands of the eastern valley, where magical beasts were already present.

Well, I knew this would be the case, which is why I came down here.

<b>

"Green Frog"

Threat Level 0.8, a large frog magical beast.

Its body length is about 80 centimeters, roughly the size of a medium-sized dog.

It’s omnivorous and seems to think anything that moves, other than itself, is food.

It’s supposed to be a magical beast that doesn’t usually gather in groups, but there are about 10 of them croaking in this narrow valley.

<b>

Just as I stepped into the valley, the closest frog shot its long tongue at me.

Really, it stretches its tongue the moment it sees something moving!

I absolutely want to avoid getting wrapped up in that and covered in slime!

I absolutely refuse to engage in any slime tentacle play!

Not happening! Just in my imagination… uh, never mind...

<b>

Ugh, this is a hassle! Let’s finish this quickly!

<b>

I slashed the incoming slimy tongue with my right sword, moved swiftly to its front, and cleaved it in two from head to tail.

There was another one nearby, so I drew my left sword and sliced it from above, cutting it into rounds.

<b>

Without delay, I swiftly dispatched the remaining frogs, slicing them vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.

<b>

Their skins seem to have some demand, but I don’t have time to collect them now, so I’ll leave them as they are.

<b>

Immediately, I moved towards the magical beasts advancing from further in.

<b>

"Little Killer Bee"

Threat Level 0.6, as the name suggests, a bee magical beast.

These bees are about the size of a fist, and I wonder where the "little" comes from? There are about twenty of them heading this way.

<b>

They are highly aggressive and vicious bees, so normally, if children encountered such a swarm, they would need to run away immediately...

But, since I can’t run away, I charged into the swarm and knocked them down one by one.

<b>

After knocking down all the bees, I turned my attention to the yellow stains clinging to the ground and wrapping around tree trunks and branches.

<b>

"Yellow Ooze"

Threat Level 0.2, a slime-like magical beast.

There are about twenty of them, each the size of a cushion.

These are more like slime molds than slimes, and among the ooze types, these lower-tier ones spread and move slowly... but they seem to be moving unusually fast?

<b>

If you get caught by them, they stick to you like glue and are hard to peel off.

Moreover, they try to digest and absorb you while still attached.

Human skin isn’t easily dissolved by them, but fabrics are not so resistant, so getting attached can lead to quite a troublesome situation.

Furthermore, when they gather in groups, they can become a large troublesome individual, and they aren’t something you can deal with using blades.

<b>

Well, they aren’t difficult to handle, though.

<b>

So, I used the "Dry" spell I created while making firewood against them.

In no time, they dried out, became crumbly, and scattered like powder.

It’s like a s〇 hurricane!! What a sight!

<b>

The fact that so many magical beasts are gathering like this must be related to the commotion in the forest.

<b>

...And the source of that commotion... they are already approaching.

<b>

I wonder if Millie has noticed? No... she hasn’t noticed.

Those guys have a high skill in concealing their presence.

Moreover, Millie’s focus is on this side... on me.

She isn’t searching for them.

<b>

They are unintentionally taking advantage of the gap in Millie’s awareness.

<b>

<b>

Those beasts have been stirring up the forest since morning and are heading this way.

They are coming from about 7 to 8 kilometers deep, from what is said to be the mid-layer.

<b>

"Red Pongo"

A magical beast resembling an ape, over 180 centimeters in length.

Its body is like that of a mountain gorilla, but its long, rust-colored fur, which gives it its name, reminds one of an orangutan.

Amidst its dark skin, its crimson eyes emit a beastly light.

These creatures are one of the vicious magical beasts that attack prey in large groups.

<b>

Their threat level is 16.

They are not beasts that appear in shallow layers, but if it’s one-on-one, Millie should be able to win against them without issue.

<b>

However, I don’t know what will happen if they get the first strike.

But with Irta and Keti here, we should be able to hold our ground... but maintaining the front line is quite tough without Aria...

<b>

But still! I have no intention of letting Millie get hurt!!

<b>

So, I threw a slow-throw knife at one that was approaching Millie.

The distance between Millie and the Red Pongo is about 5 meters.

With their leg strength, they could reach her in a single leap.

<b>

I threw the knife with an underhand throw, aiming directly at the one targeting Millie without holding back.

The distance from here is about 40 meters.

With a whoosh that cut through the air, the slow-throw knife launched from the valley, spinning rapidly as it gouged into the mountainside, rising towards its target.

In the next moment, it tore through the torso of the Red Pongo and blew off its skull.

<b>

Recognizing the exploded Red Pongo, it seems Millie and the others noticed the situation.

Immediately, Irta began casting defensive magic, and Keti cast a buff.

<b>

I quickly pulled out the remaining slow-throw knives.

I have two knife sheaths on each side of my waist.

There are a total of four knife sheaths, each holding three slow-throw knives.

In total, there are 12 knives... having already taken care of one, I quickly threw the remaining 11 slow-throw knives as I ran up the valley.

<b>

As I cut through the mountain and swept away the grass and trees, the 11 spinning blades severed the enemies one after another.

<b>

Having used all the slow-throw knives I had on hand, I took down 12 Red Pongos.

By this time, Millie and the others should have gotten their bearings.

<b>

I ran past Millie, making eye contact, and then dashed into the depths of the group.

<b>

For now, I can still see about 5 Red Pongos nearby.

I’ll leave these to them and eliminate the ones deeper inside.

<b>

The total number of the group is 53.

Having already taken down 12, and leaving 5 to them, that leaves 36 remaining!

<b>

If Aria were here, taking down 53 Red Pongos would have been a piece of cake for the four of us, but now that wall of restraint is absent.

However, if we’re just looking at firepower, Millie is said to be approaching the upper tier. Three of us should have no problem with about 5.

<b>

I charged straight into the center of the group.

These 17 that attacked Millie and the others must have been hiding to launch a second and third wave...

But I had seen through them since this morning!

<b>

<b>

Still, why did they come up from the mid-layer?

It’s unusual for them to come up in a group from that deep... This is a pattern I haven’t seen before.

<b>

There have been magical beasts that have come up from shallower areas occasionally, but at most, it was 4 or 5.

Like that "Red Death Stalker."

<b>

...Well, there are exceptions... like the "Two-Headed Boar" and "Gray Wolf" that I faced last year with Papa Howard... Oh dear.

That was an unexpected situation caused by unforeseen circumstances! It’s not something that happens often! ...Right, it doesn’t happen!!

<b>

<b>

In any case, if I leave them be, they will reach the village.

They are quite spread out east and west, but I have no intention of letting them pass through easily.

<b>

I could easily wipe them out with an "Impact Blaster," but... since Millie and the others are watching, I can’t use such flashy skills!

<b>

So, I’ll slice them down one by one!

<b>

They are scattered, hiding in trees or bushes, but there are only 36 of them!

Compared to the time I faced a number approaching four digits... this is nothing!!

<b>

With each swing of my sword, I split their bodies in two... and it took less than a minute to repeat that 36 times.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I returned to Millie and the others, they were just finishing off the last one.

<b>

A quick glance revealed two charred and carbonized bodies.

Was it Keti’s summoning magic?

The two that were slaughtered had probably been pierced in their vital points, leaving behind clean corpses.

I could see Millie’s skill at work.

Taking down 5 magical beasts with a threat level of 16 in 1 to 2 minutes is truly Team Aria! They work fast!!

<b>

<b>

There are still some weak magical beasts in the shallow layers nearby, but they aren’t in groups...

It seems the commotion has settled down now that the Red Pongos have been dealt with... as long as they don’t come this way, I can leave them be.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I moved slightly away from Millie and the others and headed towards the campsite.

I didn’t make eye contact... since we are still in the "Trial."

Normally, it would be unthinkable to come into contact with "Team Aria," who are supposed to be guarding me...

<b>

...But this time is an exceptional emergency! For now, I intend to pretend I didn’t see Millie and the others!!

<b>

Aria should be back soon, so they should come up with a response over there!

So it should be fine!!

There’s no way the "Trial" will end in failure!!!

<b>

...It should be, right? It’ll be fine... right?

<b>

.................. For now, let’s just focus on finishing this trial safely! Yes!

Once tonight passes, the "Trial" will be over!!

<b>

<b>

Oh, right! I was planning to gather some sweet potatoes for tonight’s last supper!

<b>

Three days ago, I found some Hodou potatoes on the southern slope of the hill where I am now.

I had learned from Mia that they can sometimes be found on sunny southern slopes, so it was a good thing I was searching.

<b>

Hodou potatoes are a leguminous plant, and their large swollen tubers are nutritious wild food.

They taste like a mix of potatoes and sweet potatoes and can be delicious whether boiled or roasted.

So, I was able to make a rich potato potage!

Thanks to that, the subsequent meals became abundant!

<b>

<b>

For now, I found a well-grown vine in the cluster of Hodou potatoes and pulled it up, revealing several large tubers that seemed to have grown for about 3 to 4 years. They are all about the size of my fist.

<b>

I’ll take about 5 of these home, steaming 2 for snacks and using 3 for dinner! Hehe...

<b>

As I was looking at the slope with the Hodou potatoes, a mischievous thought bubbled up.

Just below where I dug the potatoes, there was a nice grassy slope that continued. It looked like some sort of embankment...

<b>

Could I do grass skiing or... grass sliding?

<b>

Looking down, the downhill slope continued for just over 20 meters.

In the space between the trees, the grass was lush, basking in the afternoon sun, and the leaves swayed in the wind.

The grass is only about 10 centimeters tall, so it might be a type of short grass?

It was mixed with taller grasses, covering this sunny slope entirely.

If I throw myself onto this lush green carpet, wouldn’t it carry me down to the bottom?

<b>

Thinking that way, I couldn’t resist!

YOU! Just do it!! I felt like I heard a voice in my head?! Maybe?!

<b>

Well, I don’t have any tools; in my original world, I would lay down cardboard to slide!

But still! I remembered that I was wearing a leather skirt made from wolf fur around my waist!

<b>

This not only helps with warmth but also has a high waterproof effect, so even if I sit on wet ground, my butt won’t get wet, making it a great item for sitting outdoors!

<b>

So I thought about using this as a sled instead!

<b>

I took the sword out of its sheath and sat down on the grass, holding the potatoes with me.

I pulled the fur out from between my legs and spread it under my butt...

This position, with a mini skirt and both hands tucked between my legs, might be a bit indecent, but... no one is watching, so it’s fine, right?!!

<b>

Then, I slid down the slope towards the valley with great momentum!

At that moment, I cast wind magic, creating a layer of air beneath my butt!

You know, the image is like air hockey!

<b>

This slide was better than I expected! Like the wind?!!

Was it wind?! A storm?! I slid down like a gale!

<b>

...Well, that’s an exaggeration... let’s not mention that I could probably run faster!

But it felt so good!

The sensation of sliding directly on my butt was wonderful, and when I lightly bounced up at the jump point, I let out a strange sound upon landing, "Ukyan!"... but it was definitely fun!

I felt so happy that when I finished sliding, I laughed out loud, "Ahahahaha!" while throwing my arms and legs out!

<b>

<b>

<b>

For a while, I lay on my back, gazing at the blue sky, the flowing clouds, and the grass swaying in the wind, soaking in the scent of the grass, surrendering myself to the moment...

But then, I suddenly noticed a magical beast in front of me.

<b>

Well, I knew there was one around, but since it had a small presence and didn’t seem to be attacking, I had ignored it...

<b>

Why is this turtle not moving, just one meter away from me? What’s going on?

I noticed its gaze and, thinking "What’s up with you?", I propped myself up with both hands behind me, pulling my legs closer so I could get up easily, and glared at it...

<b>

<b>

"Claw Turtle"

A land turtle magical beast with a threat level of 0.3.

It’s about the size of an elephant turtle, characterized by its large spiky shell dyed in teal green.

Its only attack method is a headbutt, so as long as you don’t get in front of it, even a child can easily deal with it.

<b>

...But why is this turtle just standing there in front of me?

Huh? No? Is it breathing heavily? Why has it been staring at me?

<b>

Oh, it started moving its head back and forth.

Right, this movement is how it attacks with a headbutt... but wait? Why is it just moving its head in place? Why isn’t it attacking? Is it a warning?

But it’s breathing heavily... and what has it been staring at this whole time?… What is it looking at while moving its turtle head like that...!!!

Suddenly, I sat up and held down my skirt!!

<b>

W-What the?! This turtle!! This turtle!! Is it getting excited by looking up my mini skirt?!!

<b>

Usually, when I wear this mini skirt in the village, I wear short underpants underneath.

Otherwise, Papa Howard wouldn’t allow it...

At first, he wouldn’t let me wear something so short that my underwear would be visible. Yeah.

I was finally allowed to wear it by wearing underpants...

<b>

But during the "Trial"... there’s no one around in the forest, so I’ve been going without underpants for a week, feeling liberated!

<b>

So, right now, I’m only wearing shorts without underpants... just a thin piece of cloth! The area down there is exposed... nyahhh!!! My face is getting hotter and hotter!!

<b>

I-I had been protected by an iron wall since summer! H-How could I be seen by such a stupid turtle!!! Ughhh!!!

<b>

And what’s with this turtle?! Why is it breathing heavily and moving its head so vigorously?!!

W-Wait! What the...! It’s inching closer... it’s coming!!!

<b>

"Y-You perverted turtle!!!"

<b>

With a kick, I immediately sent that lewd turtle flying into the sky!

<b>

----------------

"What?! What is this?!!"

"Hm... what’s wrong, Alan?"

"Bernap, I might have just missed something big!!"

"Hm... that sounds serious."

"Yeah! It’s serious! I feel like I missed something I absolutely shouldn’t have missed!!"

"What are you talking about, Alan? You’re as incomprehensible as ever."

"You don’t understand, Karl! This is a big deal!!"

"I don’t get it! First, calm down!"

"Damn it... damn it!! For some reason, I’m incredibly envious of that turtle!! Damn it!!!"

"Hm, hang in there, Alan."

"Alan... where are you trying to go...?"

"Damn
