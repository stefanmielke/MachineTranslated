# 52 - Flooding of the Amkam Forest

Thank you very much for your patience.

This is my last series of posts for this year over the year-end and New Year's holidays.

<blank>

The plan is to drop 5 episodes, and if we can make it, another one or two....

......Ganbatte! pT^T

The last day of "The Trials.

The forest was buzzing that morning.

<blank>

The morning was spent doing "kata practice," which has become completely routine.

I tried to do a little magic on the sword today. ......

<blank>

This is different from putting "Ki" into it, and is unexpectedly difficult.

<blank>

If you don't swing the sword with a keen awareness, the magic power will flow out without your permission.

Is this a good way to train to control the flow of magic?

This might be a good addition to the daily training menu after returning to the village!

<blank>

Eventually, the morning passes uneventfully...

During the training, I found out that Aria had left the campsite.

It seems that they have already finished their lunch.

I continued my training for a little while longer and then decided to have a light lunch.

After the meal, we took some time to yukkuri, unwind, and get equipped.

<blank>

Tie your hair back with a string and put it together.

During the "ordeal," I sealed off my usual picktail and stayed in this short, easy ponytail.

After gathering his hair, he places the two silver-white swords in his sword holster and checks the throw-in knife in the knife sheath that hangs around his waist.

The sheath knife strapped to the leg was also pulled out and checked to make sure it fit.

Then, without putting on a cloak, they go directly outside the encampment.

<blank>

I don't intend to hunt here anymore.

And the "ordeal" ends tomorrow.

There is more than enough food.

I plan to take the remaining food back home with me as souvenirs.

Is the fur of the Horned Rabbit and the yarn of the Crowler enough for a week's worth of hunting? I think so.

<blank>

So it is not hunting that we are headed for.

It's a demonic beast defeat.

<blank>

When we descended from the small mountain where we had set up camp and arrived at the lowland valley to the east, the magical beast was already there.

Well, I knew that, so I came down here.

<blank>

The Green Frog.

Threat value 0.8 It's a large frog monster.

The dog is about 80 centimeters long, and I'd say it's a medium-sized dog.

He is an omnivore, a voracious one who considers anything that moves as food, except himself.

They are supposed to be demonic beasts that don't tend to congregate, but here they are, ten of them, gibbering away in this narrow valley.

<blank>

As I stepped into the valley, the frog closest to me flicked its long tongue at me.

When they see something moving, they immediately extend their tongues!

I will do my best to avoid getting wrapped up in such a thing and getting coated in mucous membranes!

I refuse to play with mucous membrane tentacles!

That's just in my fantasy! Only in my fantasy. ............ Yeah, it's nothing. ......

<blank>

I'm not going to be able to do that! I'll finish it quickly!

<blank>

He slashed away the tongue covered with mucous membrane coming toward him with his drawn right sword, moved quickly to the front of the main body, and slashed it open in half from the head as it was.

In addition, there was one right beside me, so I pulled out my left sword and slashed it down from above, slicing it into a circle.

<blank>

The rest of the frogs were also cut without pause, tontontontonton...vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, and that was the end of it.

<blank>

I hear there is a good demand for the skins of these guys, but I don't want to waste time collecting them now, so I'll just leave it at that.

<blank>

Immediately, he moved toward the beast that was advancing on us from further back.

<blank>

Little Killer Bee."

Threat value 0.6 As the name suggests, it is a bee magical beast.

What's so little about a bee the size of your fist? I'm not sure, but there are about 20 or so of them headed this way.

<blank>

They are highly aggressive and ferocious bees, so normally, when children encounter a swarm of this size, it would be a bad idea to run away immediately. ......

Well, I couldn't run away, so I rushed into the herd and knocked them off one by one.

<blank>

After knocking off all the bees, I turn my attention to the yellow stains that cling to my feet and to the trunks and branches of the trees.

<blank>

Yellow Ooze.

Threat value 0.2 It is a slime-like viscous demonic beast.

There are more than 20 objects about the size of a cushion.

They are more like slime than slime, and these lowly oozes spread out and move slowly...but they seem to move strangely fast, don't they?

<blank>

If you get caught by these guys, they cling to you like a torimochi and you can't peel them off.

They will try to digest and absorb it directly while attached on top of it.

Human skin is not easily melted by them, but this is not the case with cloth, so they are quite nasty people who can cause trouble if they get attached.

Moreover, when several of them gather together, they become a large individual and are troublesome, and they are not someone you can do anything about with a blade.

<blank>

Well, it's still not hard to deal with.

<blank>

Therefore, the "dry" from the firewood production is used against these guys.

In no time at all, they were dry, crumbly, crumbly, powdery, and scattered.

The hurricane of the world's largest hurricane! Nanchichi!

<blank>

The fact that these beasts are swarming in rapid succession must have something to do with the forest's rumblings, I suppose.

<blank>

It's at ....... The source of that zawah...they're already there.

<blank>

Do you think Millie has noticed? No...she hasn't noticed.

These guys are very skilled at removing signs.

In addition, Millie's attention is on me.

I'm not pointing it at the search.

<blank>

They are unintentionally exploiting that gap in Millie's perception.

<blank>

<blank>

They are the magical beasts that have been rattling the forest since this morning and are coming this way.

They were coming up in schools from about 7 to 8 kilometers back from here, in what is known as the mid-water area.

<blank>

Red Pongo

It is an ape-like magical beast, over 180 in length.

Its body is like that of a mountain gorilla, but its long, rust-colored body hair, from which it takes its name, is reminiscent of that of an orangutan.

In his dark skin, his scarlet eyes shone with a light that was typical of a demonic beast.

These guys are one of those vicious magical beasts that attack their prey in large packs.

<blank>

Its threat value is 16.

It is not a magical beast that appears in the shallow layer, but Millie can beat it in a one-on-one, head-to-head fight.

<blank>

But you never know what will happen if they strike first.

But we have both Irta and Ketty, so we can hold up well enough ......, but now that Aria is gone, it's very hard to keep the front line going....

<blank>

But, however! I have no intention of injuring Mr. Millie in sight!

<blank>

So I throw a throw-in knife at one of them that is approaching Mr. Millie.

The distance between Millie and Red Pongo is approximately 5 meters.

With their leg strength, they could reach it in one leap.

<blank>

He fired a knife at the guy who was aiming at Mr. Milly with an underhanded underhanded underhanded underhanded throw.

The distance from here is about 40 meters.

The sound of the knife cutting the air is heard! and the sound of cutting the atmosphere, a throw-in knife sent flying from the valley gouges the mountain surface with a high-speed rotation and rises toward the target.

The next moment it ripped through the torso of the red pongo that was the target and blew out its cranium.

<blank>

Recognizing the popping red pongo, Millie and the others seemed to realize what was happening.

Immediately, Irta casts a defensive spell and Ketty buffs it.

<blank>

Immediately I pull out my remaining throw-in knife.

Two knife sheaths are attached around the waist on each side.

There are four knife sheaths in total, and three throw-in knives fit in one.

Twelve in all...I had already taken care of one, so I threw the remaining eleven throw-in knives in rapid succession as I ran up and down the valley.

<blank>

The eleven spinning blades cut down the mountain and cleave the grass and trees, cutting the enemy in two, one after the other.

<blank>

He used up all the throw-in knives he had on hand and killed 12 red pongos.

Between now and then, Millie and the others should be ready to go.

<blank>

I made eye contact with Millie as I ran past her, and then ran directly into the back of the herd.

<blank>

At any rate, there are still about five red pongos visible at close range.

Leave this to me and I will destroy those in the back.

<blank>

The total number of flocks was 53.

We have already crushed 12 and left 5 to them, so we have 36 left!

<blank>

With Aria, 53 red pongos would have been an easy win for the four of us, but now we don't have that wall of control.

But if you look at the firepower alone, I'm told that Millie is approaching the top group, and three people should have no problem at all with about five of them.

<blank>

I rushed straight into the center of the herd.

These guys were probably hiding to attack the second and third wave after the first 17 attacked Millie and the others, but they were obvious to me since ...... morning!

<blank>

<blank>

But why did these guys come up from the middle of the water?

I can't believe they are coming up in packs from that far back. ...... This is a pattern I've never seen before.

<blank>

Sometimes there were some magical beasts that came up from shallower water than these guys, but four or five at the most were good.

Like that "Red Death Stalker".

<blank>

......... Well, not without exceptions... like "Two Head Bore" and "Grey Wolf" who faced off against Howard Papa last year. ...... awa... I'm not sure how much of that is true, but I'm sure it's true.

Oh, that was a sudden exception caused by unforeseen circumstances! It never happens that often! ...... Un, it doesn't!

<blank>

<blank>

In any case, if we leave it at that, these guys will reach the village.

It's pretty much spread out and scattered east and west, but I'm not going to let it pass by in a straightforward manner.

<blank>

I guess I could easily wipe them out by shooting them with "Impact Blaster", but I can't use such a fancy skill because of the eyes of ...... Millie and her friends!

<blank>

So we cut them off one by one!

<blank>

They were scattered all over the place, on top of trees or hiding in bushes, but there were only 36 of them!

Compared to that time when the number of entries was close to four digits, ...... is nothing to worry about!

<blank>

With each flash of his sword, he would split his body in two...it took less than a minute to repeat the process 36 times.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I returned to Millie and the others, I was about to put a stop to the last one.

<blank>

I glanced at two individuals that looked like they had been smoked to charcoal.

Is it Mr. Ketty's summoning magic?

The two animals after being slaughtered are clean wrecks, probably having been stabbed in one sharp spot.

Millie's deftness is apparent.

It's quintessential Team Aria to take care of 5 magical beasts with a threat value of 16 in a minute or two! Fast work!

<blank>

<blank>

There are still some weak demonic beasts chomping around in the shallow layer nearby, but they're not there in packs...

I guess the buzz seems to have died down now that the red pongo has been taken care of...so if they don't come this way, I guess I'll just leave them alone.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I passed a short distance away from Millie and the others and moved toward the encampment.

I don't make eye contact...I'm still 'on trial'.

Normally, it would be impossible for me to be in contact with "Team Aria" who is escorting me....

<blank>

But this was an unusual emergency! For now, I'm going to pretend I didn't see Millie and the others!

<blank>

Aria will be back in a little while, so I'm sure they will think of a way to deal with the situation over there!

So it should be a divey jibe!

The "ordeal" should not be a failure!

<blank>

...... should be fine, right? It'll be fine...right?

<blank>

..................... and for now! Let's just think about getting this ordeal over with! Duh!

After tonight, the 'ordeal' will be over!

<blank>

<blank>

Oops, that's right! I was going to pick up some sweet potatoes for our last supper tonight!

<blank>

Three days ago, I found a hodo potato on the southern slope of the hillside where I am now.

Mia had told me that they could sometimes be found on these sunny southern slopes, so I was right to look for them.

<blank>

The hodo potato is a legume, a nutritious wild food whose large, swollen rhizome is edible.

Its taste is like a combination of potato and sweet potato, and it can be stewed or baked.

So I was able to cook a sizzling potage soup of potatoes.

This made the meal afterwards richer!

<blank>

<blank>

At first, I found an ivy that seemed to be growing well in the hodo potato colony and pulled it out, and out came a bunch of large potatoes that looked like they had been growing for three or four years. They were all as big as my fist.

<blank>

I'll bring home about 5 of these and steam 2 for snacks and 3 for dinner! Hehe...

<blank>

And as I was holding a hodgepodge of potatoes and looking at the slope, I got a little naughty.

A little below where we dug potatoes, there was a nice sloping grassy area. It looked like a bank somewhere.

<blank>

I think you could call this grass skiing... or grass sledding.

<blank>

Looking down, the descent continues for a little more than 20 meters.

Grass grows thickly in the space created between the trees, and the grass blades are calm in the wind as they bask in the afternoon sun.

The grass is only a little over 10 cm tall, so I wonder if it's a noshiba type of plant.

It was spread all over this sunny slope, mixed with other tall grasses.

If I throw myself on this lush carpet, will the flowers catch me and carry me down?

<blank>

When I feel that way, I can't help but do it!

YOU, you should do it! I thought I heard a voice in my head saying, "You! I felt like...?

<blank>

Well, that doesn't mean we have the tools. In the original world, we would have laid down cardboard or something and skated!

But...! I remember that I have a leathery buttock around my waist made of wolf fur!

<blank>

This is not only useful for keeping the waist warm, but it is also highly waterproof, so even if you sit on wet ground, your buttocks will not get wet, making it an excellent product for sitting anywhere outdoors!

<blank>

So I thought I might try this instead of sledding. I thought.

<blank>

He removed the sword by the scabbard from the sword holster and sat down on the grass, carrying it along with a potato.

As it was, he pulled the fur out from between his legs and spread it under his buttocks....

I mean, I'm not exactly dressed like I'm in a mini-skirt with my hands in my crotch, but...no one's looking, so it's okay, right?

<blank>

and slides out toward the valley ahead with great vigor!

At this point, I chanted wind magic as if I were creating a layer of air under my buttocks!

That's it, the image is air field hockey!

<blank>

This was a better run than I expected! Like the wind already?

Wind? The storm? It slid through like a gale!

<blank>

...... Well, the wind is exaggerated...but wouldn't it be faster to run by yourself? I'm sure it would be faster if you ran by yourself!

Well, that's how good it felt!

When I jumped up on a little elevated jump with the wind knocked out of me, I let out a weird yelp when I landed... but that was fun, too!　I let out a weird yelp when I landed... but it was fun, and I'm sure I had a great time!

<blank>

It was so much fun! When we finished skiing, we threw our arms and legs out and laughed!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

For a while I lay on my back, looking at the blue sky, the flowing clouds, and the grass blowing in the wind, soaking in the scent of the grass school, and surrendering to the air of the moment. ......

But then I suddenly realized that there was a hexenbiest right in front of me.

<blank>

Well, I knew he was around, but his presence was small and he didn't seem to be attacking me, so I left him alone. ......

<blank>

Is this guy staying less than a meter away from me? Why?

I noticed the look in his eyes and thought, "What? I raised my upper body so that I could support myself with both hands behind my back, pulled my legs up so that I could get up quickly, got up on my knees, and stared at him....

<blank>

<blank>

Crawl Tortoise."

It's a land tortoise hexenbiest with a threat value of 0.3.

It is a magical beast about the size of an elephant tortoise, with a large spiny carapace dyed tail green.

The only means of attack is a head butt, so as long as they don't go around the front, even children can easily deal with them.

<blank>

But why is this turtle standing right in front of me, not moving?

Hmm? No? Is he sniffing me? Have you been staring at me since a while ago?

<blank>

Oh, he started moving his head back and forth zukon-zukon.

Yes, his attack is to headbutt you with this movement ......, but what? Why is he just moving his head right there? Why doesn't he attack? Is it a threat?

But you're still snickering... and where have you been looking all this time? ...Where are you looking and moving your turtle head so much .........!

Gabba-ba-ba-ba! and as quickly as I could, I raised my body and held down my skirt!

<blank>

Co, co, co! This guy! He's so excited to look at me in my mini-skirt?

<blank>

Usually when I wear this mini-skirt in the village, I wear short under spats underneath.

Otherwise, it's a thing that Howard Papa won't allow. ......

At first, they didn't allow me to wear such a short one that I could easily see my underwear. Unh.

I was finally forgiven for wearing underwear....

<blank>

But during the "ordeal," ...... there is no publicity in the forest, so I've been open and ununderwearable for the past week, you know?

<blank>

So, so I'm still wearing just shorts with no underwear...just a thin piece of cloth! I'm going to open up the back of my pussy with the letter M. Oh ......! I'm so excited! My face! I'm going to get hotter and hotter!

<blank>

I've been...protecting it with iron walls since summer! This...this stupid turtle is peeping at me, I am so unworthy! I'm so sorry!

<blank>

And what's this guy? What's that turtle head that's snorting and thrashing about?

Hey, hey, hey! What a... hi! Hiwa! Hiwa hiiiinnn!

Nyoaaaah! This guy! He's coming at me....he's coming at me!

<blank>

I'm going to go to the beach! Ko! Kyo-no! Erotic turtles aaaaaaahhhh! ！！！！"

<blank>

Doggone it! Immediately, the insolent erotic turtle was kicked to the ground and turned into a star in the sky!



<blank>

----------------

Ha! What's this?

"What's wrong, Alan?"

Belknap, I think I may have missed something big!

That's a lot of work.

Oh! Oh my God, I feel like I'm missing something I shouldn't miss! I feel like I'm missing something I shouldn't miss!

What are you talking about?" Alan. You still don't make any sense, do you?"

Don't you see, Carl? This is a big deal!

I don't know! You calm down first!"

Damn it...damn it! For some reason I'm irresistibly jealous of the turtles! Damn it!"

Good luck, Alan."

"Alan... where the hell do you think you're going...?"

Dick!"

<blank>

Next "The End of Suzy Cloud's Ritual"
