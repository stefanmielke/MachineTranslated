# 187 A Demon Named Van Niven

Finally, the first post of the year: .......


----------------

<blank>

The carpet has a deep indigo ground with an intricate braid pattern woven into it with clean gold threads, giving it a sense of weight.

The blood was spreading over the blood, spreading like a fearless pattern.

<blank>

Several screams echoed from the hall.

Quickly, Philip Cloud instructed his guards to surround the hall and secure an evacuation route for visitors from the venue.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

He said, "Isn't he your own father? How could you do such a terrible thing!"

<blank>

Karen, her face colorless, asks the slender man who brought this tragedy about.

<blank>

We put away the tools when we are done using them. It's a normal thing for anyone to do. It's not particularly unusual, is it?"

<blank>

This slender man, Van Niven, replied as if to say that there was nothing to worry about.

<blank>

If I could have, I would have gotten rid of those useless idiots all together," he said. Unfortunately, that's all we were instructed to do. ......

<blank>

Van muttered, letting out a sigh of disappointment. Karen stopped listening and went on, wrinkling her brow deeply.

<blank>

"What are you talking about ......? What the hell is processing ......?"

<blank>

What? I'm talking about those fools. No matter how many arrangements I make for them, they can't even break your heart. ...... They are really useless fools.

<blank>

Is that Reilly? Don't tell me it's Ruly too? Oh, no! Reilly is not your brother! I can't believe you would get rid of your brother. ...... How can you say such a horrible thing?

<blank>

It doesn't work, so there's nothing we can do about it."

<blank>

Van said this with a severely temperatureless look in his eyes, then turned his attention to his feet and continued his words.

<blank>

I've done a good enough job of it," he said. It would make sense for me to clean it up myself, wouldn't it?"

<blank>

Hey, what ......"

<blank>

"I'm a fool for believing that Munanotos has a rare vein of ore, but ...... kuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh."

<blank>

"......?!"

<blank>

He even went so far as to believe that there was a temple where the treasure lay ...... Kuku Kuku! He worked really well, but he was really greedy and didn't know how far to go ....... Kukkukkukkuk ......"

<blank>

Van was so amused that he was stifling a laugh that was about to overflow.

The only color I see in the eyes of the man who lies there and is overflowing with blood is contempt.

Their malicious eyes are just fearless to Karen.

<blank>

Wait a minute! That makes it sound like you incited your father to ...... Laurence Niven to bring down Mr. and Mrs. Merlin.

<blank>

Dalton Banjo stands in front of Karen and asks her what's going on.

<blank>

I am telling you so. Don't you understand? Kuhuh!"

<blank>

You!

<blank>

Bona Raven Casper, along with Dalton, spoke up to protect her two daughters.

<blank>

"Oh, you're ......, what the hell are you ......!"

<blank>

Unbelievable, Karen's mouth would not continue to speak.

Cordelia stands behind Karen, and the hand holding her arm grows stronger.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Will! What's going on?

<blank>

As he proceeded to evacuate the guests, Philip, on the dais, raised his voice to his son William and asked him.

<blank>

There is currently a massive undetected outbreak within Dekenbel, centered on the morgue!"

<blank>

William takes up a position to protect the customer's exit, but keeps a watchful eye on Van as he replies.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

He's the one who did it, nine times out of ten! But now Kara, along with the Edgaras, are on their way to subdue the undead, as are the Arrows, Lombarts, and Dahnas! The same goes for the Arrows, Lombard, and Dana! Lord Goldberg! Please give Carla Edghara the authority to take command of the situation!

<blank>

Good! In my name I approve!"

<blank>

Robert Randall Goldberg, the head of the Defense Organization, who is in charge of De Kembel's security, replies in a loud voice that he approves William's application.

Goldberg instructed one of the guards who was nearby to escort him to quickly send a message.

Then he turns to William again.

<blank>

And?" Mr. William Cloud. Are you sure the one there who was the eldest son of the Niven family is a ...... demon?"

<blank>

Yes, sir! He is an 'Early Vampire'! He is definitely an evil demon!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

You are ......, what the hell do you want? What the hell do you want?

<blank>

"Is it ...... I want?"

<blank>

Van playfully tilts his head in response to Karen's question and asks back.

<blank>

It's no big deal. I only want one thing."

<blank>

He clears his throat to stifle a giggle.

<blank>

Karen, it's your despair.

<blank>

Van Niven's red eyes were distorted and the corners of his mouth were turned up as if he was licking his lips.

<blank>

I just want to see you cry out in despair, and I want to see you cry out in a fit of pique."

<blank>

What?

<blank>

Karen was simply overwhelmed by the insanity of the statement.

<blank>

'Yes, yes! Originally, those little twins should have been with me by now. If I had just pecked and shredded that little piece of meat a little bit, how many pleasant tones it would have made. ...... I had made all the necessary arrangements, but it is a shame that I cannot return the favor."

<blank>

"What ......, what ...... are you saying ......?"

<blank>

Karen's own hands could not stop shaking at Van's words, which were so fearless.

<blank>

It was inevitable because we have our priorities. But...! Rest assured. We will definitely pick you up soon! And after I have had my fill of the two of you, I will responsibly return the two heads I so lovingly adorned with gratitude! Please look forward to it."

<blank>

The corners of Van's mouth hangs impossibly high.

<blank>

The blood on Karen's face was disappearing as she looked at him. Her breathing was very labored.

It's like being coated in a horribly murky sludge that is a mixture of all the bad feelings in the world.

<blank>

Oh." That's it! That's it! You look so good, Karen!

<blank>

Van's laugh is squeezed from the back of his throat.

It is an unpleasant sound that makes the listener nervous, and it is not something that one would expect to be produced by a human being.

<blank>

In Karen's mind, the horrific images of Dan and Nan that Van described come to mind.

The fear of losing two irreplaceable people is chipping away at Karen's heart.

Van's mouth goes up even more as he looks it over.

<blank>

Breathing becomes fast and shallow and hands are very cold.

I think someone is calling to me in the distance, but I can't see very well because my vision is limited.

The world is losing color.

However, I was aware that my body was trembling tremendously, as if I was in an extremely cold place.

<blank>

<blank>

Cordelia quickly hugged Karen's body, which was still shaking, from behind with her whole body.

<blank>

Karen! You don't have to listen to those fearless words! Everyone here is on your side! No one is going to touch Karen and her sisters and brothers! No one will allow that to happen! That's why ......!"

<blank>

Cordelia puts her arms around Karen's body.

<blank>

So! Don't be afraid! I'm here!

<blank>

Cordelia's words, with her face pressed against her back, resonated directly with Karen.

The warmth she felt on her back brought back the iris to Karen's consciousness.

<blank>

"...... Cody. ......Thank you Cody."

<blank>

Karen put her own hand over Cordelia's, which clung to her chest, still cowering over it.

Karen felt Cordelia's warmth sink deep into her heart.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

......, you're doing a poor imitation of me."

<blank>

Van, who had seen Karen regain her senses immediately, raised his eyebrows uncomfortably and pointed his finger at Cordelia. It suddenly turned into a black spear and extended in a straight line toward Cordelia.

<blank>

But William slipped into the line of fire and quickly knocked down the black spear with his own round shield.

<blank>

I won't let you do it again!"

<blank>

Furthermore, Irving pops out from behind William.

In an instant, Irving was right in front of Van, where he swung his two-handed sword.

<blank>

Van, however, jumps back and ducks the tip of the knife with a single stroke of the paper.

<blank>

But as he jumped back, Alicia's kick struck Van.

<blank>

Alicia's kick, which exerted centrifugal force and emitted a strong glow of caged Ki, blew Van away and slammed his body head-on into the hall wall.

<blank>

Damn! I knew he was tough as hell."

<blank>

Alicia slowly folded and lowered her right leg, which was raised in a Y-shape, and muttered evasively.

<blank>

I'm a little disturbed. Are you a little presumptuous?"

<blank>

Pulling his body out of the large sunken wall, his face contorted in discomfort, Van also spits out a few words.

<blank>

Irving's two-handed sword, which he had just brought down, again came close to his shoulder.

Van swung his right hand up and swatted away the streak with his knife-like black claw.

<blank>

You're the one with hubris!"

<blank>

Immediately, William struck the van from below with his own round shield, snapping its jaw up.

He continues to thrust his right-hand longsword into Van's chest.

But Van grabs William's longsword and instantly stops him in his tracks.

<blank>

I say you are in my way!"

<blank>

Van's eyes burned red. At the same time, several magic circles appeared around it.

<blank>

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Back off, Irving! Alicia!

<blank>

William shouted and shielded his body with his own shield.

At the same time, icicles the size of a person's arm shot out in all directions from multiple magic circles floating around them.

<blank>

Irving slashes away the icicle with the blade of his two-handed sword, strikes it down with the hilt, and scrambles under it.

<blank>

Alicia raised both hands to guard, crushing the approaching ice with the backs of her fists, spinning like a dancing leaf and slipping between the icicles.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I've joined these two arms together! Now it's up to Colin and Willie to apply the 'body repair'! I'll try to resuscitate this one!"

<blank>

Upon arriving at the hall, Jessica Karloff immediately rushed to the injured and began treating them at the same time.

After Jessica finished treating the two guards who had their arms cut off, she kneeled beside Lawrence Niven, who had been stabbed in the heart.

<blank>

"Is this one poisoned, too? Is it more poisonous than the other two?"

<blank>

Jessica turns her head to the three who continue to fight as she applies the "detoxification" to Lawrence's body.

<blank>

"Careful, all three of you! His weapon is poison!"

<blank>

I know!"

<blank>

To Jessica's cry, Irving replies by knocking off a black nail with his haft.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Jessica, is there anything we can do to help?"

<blank>

As Jessica was about to begin her treatment, Anthony Reinberger and Caroline Goldberg approached and approached her.

<blank>

We've done detoxification and wound regeneration. We are going to try to perform CPR, but the resuscitation rate is not very high. If possible, I would like to ask them to help me increase the success rate by giving me life force.

Roger that.

I'll try. It's all right, isn't it? Father."

Oh, give him a hand."

"Send an urgent message to Daegami-dono! Make arrangements to receive them!"

<blank>

Robert Randall Goldberg allowed his daughter Caroline to help with the treatment.

At the same time, Cordwainer Rheinberger sends a messenger to prepare Lawrence for transport and to the Great Temple to make it ready to receive him.

<blank>

I'll begin! Pray for Rebirth"

<blank>

Placing both hands on Lawrence's chest, Jessica recites the prayer.

Soon a divine light spills from his hand and envelops the area.

<blank>

<blank>

Van caught the movement out of the corner of his eye, frowned and clicked his tongue loudly.

<blank>

I have already taken care of that. Please stop your unnecessary attempts!"

<blank>

Van turns to Jessica and activates the magic.

In the space between them, a dozen or so magic circles emerged one after another in just a few moments, from which icicles surged out all at once.

Jessica, however, is focused on the treatment, keeping her eyes on the hand and not moving.

<blank>

Tsk!"

You son of a bitch!

I can't! Jessica!!!!"

<blank>

The three who had been engaged in a battle with Van suddenly turn their bodies quickly to deal with the attack directed at someone other than themselves.

But before Alicia's fists, Irving's two-handed sword, and William's shield could extend, the magical icicles were closing in to crush Jessica and her friends with their overwhelming mass.

<blank>

A high-pitched screeching sound echoed throughout the hall as huge blocks of ice collided and regrouped, crushing each other with their mass. It seemed as if a huge ice block would form inside the hall, creaking.

<blank>

At ...... or so, the chunks of ice shattered and scattered.

<blank>

The shards of shattered ice shimmer in the light and scatter all over the area.

<blank>

'Am I Late? My Sweetheart"

No problem. No problem.

<blank>

There was Victor Frank, shining his light-armed magic seal and crushing ice cubes with the bucklers equipped on both hands.

To Victor, Jessica replies without taking her eyes off the hand.

<blank>

For my part, I think it could have been a little quicker, Victor."

You're a worrier, Mr. Chairman."

<blank>

As expected, it was very much like you.

'You do everything you can to live up to a lady's expectations, don't you? Princess."

<blank>

"Swashbuckler's 'damage limitation' caught you. That's impressive."

"Thank you, Lord Goldberg."

<blank>

Victor's use of "damage limitation" is a unique skill of his class, the swashbuckler.

It shrugs off physical damage with the expenditure of magic power, limiting the amount of damage suffered below a certain level.

Victor's high defense and recovery capabilities are the key to his success.

<blank>

"Well, gentlemen, leave the protection from here on out to me! Leave the protection from here to me and do your best to destroy the enemy!"

<blank>

The buckler equipped in both hands is gashiri! and Victor raises his voice.

<blank>

I don't need to be told!"

<blank>

Alicia returned the shout with a series of left and right blows as she shook her ponytail and turned her body.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A small bead of sweat appears on Jessica's forehead.

Soon, the radiance spilling from the palm shrinks, becomes a tiny thing, and fleetingly disappears.

Jessica exhaled a long, thin, threadbare breath.

At that moment, the chest of the prone Lawrence dips for a moment, and then his entire body jumps up in a big leap.

<blank>

Successfully performed CPR! Please take care of him at the Great Hall of the Goddess of Mercy immediately!

Yes, Father.

Mm! Brilliant!"

"Hurry up and transport him! At all costs, this man must be interrogated!"

<blank>

Under the direction of Cordwainer Leinberger, the survivors are carried out of the hall, followed by the Goldberg father and daughters.

Casper and Banjo also leave the hall, protecting their respective daughters.

The last remaining Cloud father and daughter served as the Lords of the house.

<blank>

Brother." Take care!"

<blank>

William, with Annie's words at his back, flicks the black spear away with the round shield on his arm.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Jessica looks away from it and turns her attention to the center of the hall.

<blank>

Thanks for waiting!

<blank>

Jessica put her hands together in front of her, closed her eyes and began to recite the prayer.

Magic power is gathered and a clean radiance emanates from the combined hands.

<blank>

A Sacred Blessing."

<blank>

The hall was filled with a holy radiance.

The blessing increases the healing power of allies, diminishes the power of evil, and imbues each weapon with a holy radiance.

<blank>

O old tree, recite to the wind. Sing with us a song of joy, a song of victory, and dance with us! 'Warlike spirits rise'!"

The afterglow of the flame, soar, fire god! Let the flame of life soar! Increase life force!

<blank>

Colin chanted war chants, raising the battle spirit of his allies in the field and raising the combat power.

Willie applies fire-based life-enhancing support magic to each of the vanguard members.

<blank>

<blank>

Van's face is distorted with hatred at the blessed light filling the hall.

<blank>

The abominable light! But! This is far from enough to diminish the power I have been given!"

<blank>

As if to say that such brilliance would not work, Van took Alicia's fist on the chest and even repelled it.

She then swings her arm out and brings down her black claw. With this blow, Alicia's body is blown away about 10 meters.

<blank>

Alicia immediately stood up and regained her stance, but her guarded arm had a mark like a slash and blood was dripping. In addition, black blood spilled from her mouth.

Alicia spits the blood in her mouth on the floor, wipes her own blood from her mouth with her arm, and runs toward the van again.

<blank>

Detox!"

<blank>

A sparkle was thrown toward Alicia as she ran.

The clean radiance envelops Alicia and then fades away as if soaking into her body.

<blank>

Alicia turns to Jessica, gives her a thumbs up, and runs straight to the van.

<blank>

Will! Protective barrier!"

<blank>

Colin further directs a support spell at William to increase the solidity of his shield.

William's round shield is bathed in a faint light as it receives magical power.

<blank>

With his shield, William struck the van head-on.

A "shield bash" was released.

Van was knocked back by a blow from the shield and was played backward.

<blank>

Alicia, let's go! Let the fighting spirit of the flame be in your sword. Wielding the flaming sword, the hero dances. The power of the warrior!"

<blank>

Willy flew a fire-attribute, attack-increasing support magic to Alicia.

<blank>

Alicia rotates her body vertically, as if cutting a dragonfly.

As if to greet Van, who had been flung away by William, he centrifuged upward toward Van's shoulder and slammed him down with a heel drop that was covered with the magic power of fire.

<blank>

Shit!"

<blank>

The impact unintentionally brings Van to his left knee.

But at the same time, he paid off his own arm and played Alicia again.

<blank>

In that moment, Irving sits back slightly and makes a puddle. His dark blonde hair sways and his eyes take on a faint golden hue.

At the same time, the sword body is clothed in a golden light.

<blank>

Slash Impact!"

<blank>

He steps forward, shattering the floor, and a light of slashes with "Ki" runs through the air, swept off to the side.

<blank>

At the moment of kneeling, Van showed a slight gap. The blade of the two-handed sword was sucked into his right side.

<blank>

<blank>

But the two-handed sword stopped biting about halfway down the width of the sword.

Still, the golden "Ki" of the sword blade roasts the meat in its mouth, making it billow white smoke.

<blank>

<blank>

I will not let you pass so many times! Well, before that, I say your sword is too light!"

Kuso!"

<blank>

Immediately, Van's black claws strike Irving.

Irvin's body was bounced to the wall and slammed from his back.

<blank>

<blank>

Jessica flies 'healing' to Alicia, who was played off, and to Irving.

At that moment, a line of blood poured from Jessica's nose.

<blank>

Jessica?

I'm fine. I'm fine.

<blank>

Quickly, Colin rushed over, wiped the blood off it, and applied "Vital Up" to Jessica.

<blank>

Before coming to the hall, Jessica had already restored two humans. Immediately upon arrival, she performed "healing" on two more guards, and performed a further miracle of resuscitation.

As of now, he maintains the sanctuary's boundaries and is also the sole healer.

The strain on her in this short time is extraordinary.

<blank>

Thank you, Colin. That's enough."

If you feel you've reached your limit, I'm going to take you from here, so brace yourself, my honey."

<blank>

Victor smiles at Jessica as he deals with the occasional ice block or black spear that comes at the rear guard to exploit an opening.

<blank>

Don't worry. It won't cost you anything more.

I'm sure it's ....... It's definitely been cut down a lot."

<blank>

Colin turned his magic-enveloped eyes on the enemy and gave a small gesture of agreement to Jessica.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Alicia, who again received support magic from Willie, breathes quietly on the spot.

Lowering the hips and breathing slowly and powerfully, gather Ki from the surroundings and store it in the lower abdomen.

Soon the air began to swirl quietly around Alicia.

Quietly, half-opened eyes serenely capture the target.

<blank>

Geezero Flying Knee Kick!"

<blank>

Alicia stomps violently through the floor and, as if shot out by a cannon, flies through the hall in a straight line.

The knee, with the glow of compressed Ki and compressed ether, spills light in its wake along with afterimages.

Leaving an explosion roaring backward on the floor, his knee kick pierced Van's chest with the force of a cannonball.

<blank>

Van's body was blown away by the explosive force of the blast and sent flying out of the room, shattering the glass door facing the garden.

<blank>

Let's go!

<blank>

William and Irving head out to follow.

<blank>

<blank>

In the glass-splattered courtyard, Van, on one knee, slowly raises himself up.

At the same time, the gouged-out and sunken chest area rises with a crackling sound, and the chest plate becomes thicker than the original.

His arms are now more than one size thicker, and his overall physique seems to have grown.

<blank>

His body, already stripped of his tattered jacket and shirt, was bloated and bore no resemblance to his original slender body.

Beneath the skin, several thick vein-like ducts emerged, occasionally writhing fearlessly.

It seemed to take on a faintly smoky silver color with each wriggle.

<blank>

Van steps forward as if proud of his undamaged body.

However, the wound on his side, inflicted by Irving, had not healed and was still smoking white.

<blank>

It's okay," he said. It seems that the harvest is already over. It's time for you to leave now."

<blank>

I'm sorry, but there is no way out of these wards."

<blank>

William steps over the glass scattered around the yard and steps toward the van.

<blank>

How about that?"

<blank>

In response to William's words, Van, with a wry smile on his face, suddenly held out both hands upward.

<blank>

"We would have been happy to overrun you, but ....... If you've already done what you have to do, you're welcome to return. You might as well be thankful for His mercy."

You're a sore loser!"

<blank>

William caught something above the van as Irving let out a yell.

He quickly restrains Irving, who is about to step out, and protects himself with his shield.

<blank>

At the same time, a bolt of lightning struck the van and a flash of light enveloped the area.

A roar ripped through the atmosphere, shaking the whole area around him, and he barely stopped himself from being blown away by the impact.

<blank>

"The 'Strike of the God of Thunder'?

<blank>

William looked around after the impact had subsided and shouted in surprise.

<blank>

I don't believe you pulled out the wards. I didn't expect an attack to get through here. ......"

<blank>

William raises his eyebrows at the charred human-shaped object lying where Van had been just moments before.

<blank>

Are you suggesting that they processed the evidence to destroy it?"

<blank>

The object, with its white smoke, is clearly what used to be a person.

It must have been instantly carbonized by the roaring thunder. So this guy was the same, but the guy who was using this guy is also a person who treats others as a disposable tool.

William cannot hide his displeasure at the sensitivity of his counterpart.

<blank>

<blank>

"No, he's not. This is not him.

<blank>

Alicia dismisses William's idea from behind.

<blank>

It's like Kara's cicada. They switched bodies. They got away with it."

<blank>

You're not saying you used 'target transposition'? A living opponent?

"Technically, it's not even alive, because the subject is a vampire ...... 'undead'."

<blank>

Colin, who came out of the room, also expressed his opinion. The "object transposition" is a magic that can swap two objects that are some distance apart.

It is common knowledge that the object is only an object and cannot be moved by living things.

Colin says that the subject is not a 'creature' this time.

<blank>

"We definitely had them cornered, ....... I didn't think we'd ever get past these wards."

<blank>

Jessica, who came out clutching Viktor's arm, spilled out some frustrated words.

<blank>

"There ain't enough ....... Not at all! I ain't got enough power!!!!"

<blank>

Even more frustratingly, Irving's exasperated cry echoes out.

Jessica's fist gently poked Irving's head.
