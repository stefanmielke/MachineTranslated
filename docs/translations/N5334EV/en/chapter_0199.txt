# Chapter 187: The Monster Named Van Niven

Finally, the first post of the year...

----------------

<b>

A heavy carpet woven with intricate patterns of pure gold thread on a deep indigo ground, giving a sense of depth.

On top of it, dark blood slowly spread, overwriting the dreadful patterns.

<b>

From within the venue, multiple screams echoed.

Philip Cloud quickly gave instructions to the guards, ensuring the encirclement of the hall and the evacuation routes for the guests.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Isn't that your father?! How could you do something so terrible?!"

<b>

Karen, losing color from her face, questioned the slender man who brought this tragedy.

<b>

"Once a tool is used, it must be disposed of. It's something anyone would do normally. It's not particularly unusual, is it?"

<b>

The slender man, Van Niven, replied as if it were a matter of course.

<b>

"If possible, I would have liked to dispose of those useless, dull-witted ones as well. Unfortunately, the only instruction I received was to handle this..."

<b>

Van sighed as if regretting it, and Karen caught that, deepening the furrow in her brow.

<b>

"What are you saying...? Handle what...?"

<b>

"What do you mean? I'm talking about those foolish brothers of yours. No matter how much I prepared everything, I couldn't even break your heart... Truly useless fools."

<b>

"Are you talking about Rayleigh? No way, Ruuri too?! No! Rayleigh is not your brother! To dispose of your own brother... How can you say something so terrible?!"

<b>

"They're useless, so it's unavoidable."

<b>

Van coldly declared that, then looked down at his feet and continued speaking.

<b>

"This has done its job well enough up to this point. It would only be proper for me to take care of it myself, wouldn't it?"

<b>

"W-What...?"

<b>

"That fool who believed there was a rare vein in Munanotos... Hmph."

<b>

"...What?!"

<b>

"Moreover, he seriously believed there was a temple where treasures sleep... Hahaha! They worked hard, but they were truly greedy, completely unaware of their own limits... Hehehehe..."

<b>

Van spoke as if he found it amusing, suppressing laughter that threatened to spill over.

In his eyes, looking at the man lying there bleeding, there was nothing but contempt.

That malicious gaze was utterly horrifying to Karen.

<b>

"Wait! It sounds like you're saying you incited your own father... Lawrence Niven, and trapped the Merlin couple."

<b>

Dalton Banjo stood in front of Karen, questioning what it meant.

<b>

"That's exactly what I'm saying. Don't you understand? Hmph!"

<b>

"You bastard!!"

<b>

Bona Raven Casper stood alongside Dalton, protecting the two daughters and raising her voice.

<b>

"Y-You are... Who are you?!"

<b>

Unable to believe it, words failed to continue from Karen's mouth.

Cordelia, standing behind Karen, tightened her grip on Karen's arm.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Will! What happened?!"

<b>

While facilitating the evacuation of the guests, Philip called out to his son William from the stage.

<b>

"Currently, a large number of undead are appearing centered around the corpse storage in Dekember!"

<b>

William positioned himself to guard the guests' escape route, answering without taking his eyes off Van.

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

"Most likely, it's his doing! However, Carla is currently heading to suppress the undead with the Edgar family subordinates! Arrows, Lombard, and Dana are doing the same! Lord Goldberg! Please grant Carla Edgar the authority to command on-site!!"

<b>

"Very well! I shall approve it in my name!"

<b>

Robert Randall Goldberg, head of the Dekember security organization, responded loudly, approving William's request.

Goldberg instructed one of the guards nearby to quickly send a messenger.

Then he turned his face back to William.

<b>

"So? William Cloud. Is that Niven family's eldest son... a monster?"

<b>

"Yes! He is an 'Early Vampire'! Without a doubt, an evil monster!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What do you want...? What is your desire?!"

<b>

"My desire...? Is that so?"

<b>

Van tilted his head mockingly in response to Karen's question.

<b>

"It's nothing grand. My desire is but one thing."

<b>

He chuckled, suppressing laughter.

<b>

"Karen, it is your despair."

<b>

With a twisted smile and a glint in his red eyes, Van Niven spoke in a chilling voice.

<b>

"I just want to see you crushed by despair, crying and screaming without restraint."

<b>

"Wha?!"

<b>

Karen was left speechless by his outrageous words.

<b>

"Indeed! Originally, those young twins should have been with me by now. If I had nibbled on that little flesh bit by bit, how delightful the sounds they would have made... I had everything prepared, but it is truly regrettable."

<b>

"What... What are you saying...?"

<b>

Unable to stop the trembling of her hands from Van's horrifying words, Karen felt a chill.

<b>

"There are priorities, so it was unavoidable. But! Rest assured. I will definitely come to pick them up soon! And after thoroughly enjoying the two of them, I will return their adorably decorated heads with gratitude! Please, look forward to it."

<b>

Van's mouth curled into an impossibly wide grin.

<b>

The blood drained from Karen's face. Her breathing became ragged.

It felt as if all the evil emotions in the world were mixed together, drowning her in a terrifying, murky sludge.

<b>

"Ah! Yes! That's it! Such a lovely face, Karen?!"

<b>

Van let out a laugh that seemed to come from the depths of his throat.

It was an unpleasant sound that grated on the nerves of anyone who heard it, something that seemed far from human.

<b>

Karen's mind conjured the horrific images of Dan and Nan that Van had described.

The fear of losing her irreplaceable two was gnawing at Karen's heart.

Van's smile only widened as he observed this.

<b>

Her breathing became quick and shallow, and her hands felt extremely cold.

She felt as if someone was calling her from afar, but her vision was narrowing, making it hard to tell.

Colors were fading from the world.

She was only aware of her body shaking as if she were in a place of extreme cold.

<b>

<b>

Cordelia instinctively hugged the trembling Karen from behind.

<b>

"Karen! You don't need to hear such horrifying words! Everyone here is on your side! No one can harm you and your brother! No one will allow such a thing!! So...!"

<b>

Cordelia tightened her arms around Karen's body.

<b>

"So! Don't be afraid! I am here!!"

<b>

Cordelia's words, pressed against Karen's back, resonated directly with her.

The warmth she felt on her back slowly brought Karen's awareness back into focus.

<b>

"...Cordy... Thank you, Cordy."

<b>

Karen placed her hand over Cordelia's hand, which was clinging to her chest, and added her strength from above.

She felt Cordelia's warmth seep deep into her heart.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"...What a foolish act you are doing."

<b>

Seeing Karen quickly regain her composure, Van frowned in displeasure and pointed a finger at Cordelia. It instantly became a black spear, stretching straight towards Cordelia.

<b>

However, William slipped into the line of fire and quickly knocked the black spear away with his round shield.

<b>

"I won't let you do as you please anymore!"

<b>

From behind William, Arvin jumped out.

Arvin quickly closed in on Van, swinging his two-handed sword.

<b>

However, Van dodged the blade by a hair's breadth.

<b>

But just after that, Alicia's kick struck Van.

Alicia's kick, infused with centrifugal force and glowing with contained "ki," sent Van flying, slamming his body against the wall of the hall.

<b>

"Damn! This guy is abnormally tough."

<b>

Alicia slowly lowered her right leg, which she had raised in a Y-shape, muttering in annoyance.

<b>

"This is getting a bit annoying. Are you getting a bit too full of yourself?"

<b>

Van dragged his body out from the large dent in the wall, his face twisted in displeasure.

<b>

Once again, Arvin's two-handed sword was about to strike Van's shoulder.

Van swatted away the sword with his right hand, using his knife-like black claws.

<b>

"You're the one who's getting full of yourself!"

<b>

Immediately, William struck Van's chin with his round shield from below.

Then he thrust his longsword into Van's chest.

However, Van caught William's longsword, instantly halting its movement.

<b>

"I'm telling you, you're in the way!"

<b>

Van's eyes burned red. At the same time, multiple magic circles appeared around him.

<b>

"Not good! Get back, Arvin! Alicia!"

<b>

William shouted, shielding himself with his shield.

At the same time, ice pillars as thick as a human's arm surged from the multiple magic circles floating around, shooting out in all directions.

<b>

Arvin slashed at the ice pillars with the blade of his two-handed sword, knocking them down with the hilt, and slipped beneath them.

<b>

Alicia raised both hands to solidify her guard, shattering the approaching ice with the back of her fists, while spinning like a leaf, slipping between the ice pillars.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I've joined the two of them! Now, Colin and Willy, cast 'Body Repair' on them! I will attempt this resurrection!"

<b>

Jessica Karoff, who had arrived in the hall, immediately rushed to the injured and began treatment.

After finishing the treatment for the two guards who had their arms severed, Jessica knelt beside Lawrence Niven, who had been stabbed in the heart.

<b>

"Is he also poisoned? More so than the other two?"

<b>

While applying "Detox" to Lawrence's body, Jessica turned her face towards the three who were continuing the battle.

<b>

"Be careful, all three of you! His weapon is poisoned!"

<b>

"I know!"

<b>

In response to Jessica's shout, Arvin knocked away the black claws with the hilt of his sword.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Jessica, is there anything we can help with?"

<b>

Anthony Reinberger and Caroline Goldberg approached Jessica, who was about to begin treatment, and spoke.

<b>

"I've finished detoxifying and regenerating the wounds. Now I'm going to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but the success rate isn't high. If possible, I would like to ask the two of you to help increase the success rate with 'Life Force Bestowal.'"

"Understood."

"I'll give it a try. Is that alright with you, Father?"

"Yes, go ahead and help."

"Hurry and send a messenger to the Great Temple! Prepare for their acceptance!"

<b>

Robert Randall Goldberg permitted his daughter Caroline to assist in the treatment.

At the same time, Codeweiner Reinberger sent a messenger to prepare for the transportation of Lawrence and the acceptance at the Great Temple.

<b>

"I'll begin! 'Resurrection Prayer.'"

<b>

Jessica placed both hands on Lawrence's chest and began to chant a prayer.

Immediately, divine light spilled from her hands, enveloping the area.

<b>

<b>

Van, catching sight of this movement from the corner of his eye, frowned and clicked his tongue loudly.

<b>

"That is something I have already taken care of. I would appreciate it if you would refrain from unnecessary actions!"

<b>

Van directed magic towards Jessica.

In the space between them, numerous magic circles appeared in a brief moment, and ice pillars surged forth from them.

However, Jessica remained focused on her treatment, not taking her eyes off her hands.

<b>

"Tch!!"

"Dammit!"

"Not good! Jessica!!!"

<b>

The three who were engaged in battle with Van quickly turned to deal with the sudden attack directed at someone other than themselves.

However, before Alicia's fist, Arvin's two-handed sword, or William's shield could reach, the mass of magical ice pillars rushed toward Jessica and the others with overwhelming force.

<b>

A loud, high-pitched scream echoed as massive ice blocks collided and crushed each other throughout the hall. It seemed as if a gigantic ice block was forming within the hall, creaking as it did so.

<b>

...But at that moment, the ice mass shattered into countless pieces.

<b>

The fragments of ice sparkled with light, scattering everywhere, and in the center stood a figure.

<b>

"Am I late, my sweetheart?"

"Just as usual. No problem."

<b>

Victor Frank, clad in light armor and glowing with magical symbols, had shattered the ice blocks with the bucklers he wielded in both hands.

To Victor, Jessica replied without taking her eyes off her hands.

<b>

"I think it would have been better if you had come a bit earlier, Victor."

"You worry too much, President."

<b>

"You certainly made an entrance that lived up to expectations."

"You must respond to a lady's expectations with all your might, right, Princess?"

<b>

"You used 'Damage Control' to absorb it, didn't you? Impressive."

"I am honored, Lord Goldberg."

<b>

The "Damage Control" that Victor used is a unique skill possessed by the class known as Swashbuckler.

It absorbs physical damage at the cost of magical power, limiting the amount of damage taken to a certain threshold.

This is only possible due to Victor's innate high defense and recovery abilities.

<b>

"Now, everyone! Leave the defense from here on to me, and focus on annihilating the enemy!"

<b>

Victor clapped his bucklers together and raised his voice.

<b>

"No need to tell me twice!"

<b>

Alicia, shaking her ponytail, shouted back while delivering a series of blows to the left and right.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

A small bead of sweat appeared on Jessica's forehead.

Gradually, the radiance that had been spilling from her palms contracted, becoming a mere flicker before fading away.

Jessica let out a long, thin breath.

At that moment, Lawrence's chest briefly caved in, then his body jumped up significantly.

<b>

"Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was successful! Please treat him urgently at the Great Temple!!"

"That's what he says, Father."

"Indeed! Splendid!"

"Hurry and transport him! We must interrogate this man at all costs!!"

<b>

Under the command of Codeweiner Reinberger, those who had survived were carried out of the hall, with the Goldberg father and daughter following suit.

Casper and Banjo also left the hall while protecting their respective daughters.

Lastly, the Cloud father and daughter served as the final escort.

<b>

"Brother! Be careful!"

<b>

William deflected a black spear with his round shield, responding to Annie's words as he moved.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After seeing them off, Jessica turned her gaze to the center of the hall.

<b>

"Sorry to keep you waiting!"

<b>

Jessica clasped her hands together in front of her, closed her eyes, and began to chant a prayer.

Magical power gathered, and a pure radiance emanated from her joined hands.

<b>

"Holy Blessing."

<b>

The hall was filled with sacred light.

Due to the blessing, the recovery power of allies increased, the evil forces diminished, and the holy light dwelled in each weapon.

<b>

"Old tree, sing in the wind. Play the song of joy, the song of victory, and dance together! 'Increase Battle Spirit!'"

"Flames of the remaining light, scatter fire god! Ignite the flame of life! 'Increase Life Force!!'"

<b>

Colin chanted a battle song, raising the battle spirit of allies within the field and enhancing their combat power.

Willy cast a support spell to increase fire attribute life force on each of the front-line fighters.

<b>

<b>

Van's expression twisted with hatred as he glared at the blessed light filling the hall.

<b>

"That accursed light! However! This level is far from enough to diminish the power I have received!!"

<b>

As if to say that this light would not affect him, Van received Alicia's punch with his chest and even deflected it back.

He swung his arm, bringing down his black claws. With that one strike, Alicia was sent flying over ten meters.

<b>

Alicia quickly stood up and regained her stance where she landed, but her guarded arm bore a slash mark and was bleeding profusely. Dark blood dripped from her mouth.

Spitting the blood from her mouth onto the floor, Alicia wiped the blood from her mouth with her arm and ran towards Van again.

<b>

"Detox!"

<b>

A glow was thrown towards Alicia as she ran.

The pure light enveloped Alicia, seeping into her body as it disappeared.

<b>

Alicia gave Jessica a thumbs-up and then ran towards Van.

<b>

"Willy!! 'Guardian Barrier!'"

<b>

Colin cast a support spell to enhance the firmness of William's shield.

William's round shield glowed faintly as it absorbed the magical power.

<b>

With that shield, William struck Van head-on.

What was unleashed was a "Shield Bash."

Van was knocked back by the impact of the shield.

<b>

"Alicia, let's go! Infuse the spirit of fire into your sword. Wield that flame sword, and let the warrior dance. 'Warrior's Power!'"

<b>

Willy cast a support spell to increase Alicia's fire attribute attack power.

<b>

Alicia rotated her body vertically like a dragonfly cutting through the air.

Then, as she approached Van, who had been knocked back by William, she aimed a downward kick infused with centrifugal force and fire magic at his shoulder.

<b>

"Ugh!"

<b>

The impact caused Van to instinctively kneel on his left knee.

But at the same time, he swatted Alicia away again.

<b>

In that moment, Arvin slightly lowered his waist to gather energy. His dark blonde hair swayed, and his eyes took on a faint golden hue.

Simultaneously, a golden light enveloped the blade of his sword.

<b>

"Slash Impact!"

<b>

As he stomped down, the "ki" wrapped around his horizontal slash shattered the floor.

<b>

In the moment Van knelt, a slight opening appeared. The blade of the two-handed sword ran into his right side.

<b>

<b>

However, the two-handed sword stopped halfway through the width of the blade.

Even so, the sword wrapped in golden "ki" burned the flesh it touched, emitting white smoke.

<b>

<b>

"I won't let you through that easily! Well, before that, I told you your sword is too light!"

"Dammit!"

<b>

Immediately, Van's black claws lunged at Arvin.

Arvin was sent flying against the wall, crashing down on his back.

<b>

<b>

Jessica sent healing magic to both the knocked-back Alicia and Arvin.

At that moment, a trickle of blood flowed from Jessica's nose.

<b>

"Jessica?!"

"Don't worry, I'm fine."

<b>

Colin rushed over, wiping the blood away and casting "Vital Up" on Jessica.

<b>

Before arriving at the hall, Jessica had already healed two people. Immediately upon arrival, she had also healed two more guards and performed further miracles of resurrection.

Currently, she was maintaining the sanctum's barrier and taking on the role of healer.

The burden on her during this short time was not trivial.

<b>

"Thank you, Colin. I'm fine."

"If you feel like you're reaching your limit, I'll whisk you away from here, so be prepared, my honey."

<b>

While dodging the ice blocks and black spears that occasionally attacked the rear guard, Victor smiled at Jessica.

<b>

"Don't worry. It won't be long now."

"Indeed. I can feel my strength waning significantly."

<b>

Colin, with magical circles in his eyes, directed his gaze at the enemy and subtly indicated his agreement to Jessica.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Once again, Alicia, having received support magic from Willy, quietly steadied her breathing.

She lowered her waist, gathering "ki" from around her with strong, steady breaths, accumulating it in her lower abdomen.

Gradually, the air began to swirl quietly around Alicia.

Her half-open eyes calmly locked onto her target.

<b>

"Zero Flying Knee Kick!"

<b>

Alicia stomped down hard on the floor, launching herself straight through the hall like a cannonball.

The knee she thrust out, glowing with the "ki" and compressed ether, left a trail of light in its wake.

With a thunderous explosion resonating on the floor, her knee strike pierced Van's chest with the force of a cannonball.

<b>

Van's body was blown away by the explosive power, shattering the glass door facing the garden as he was propelled outside.

<b>

"I'm going after him!"

<b>

William and Arvin followed suit, heading outside.

<b>

In the courtyard, amidst the scattered glass, Van slowly rose to his feet on one knee.

At the same time, his caved-in chest began to swell with cracking sounds, becoming thicker than before.

His arms grew thicker, and his overall physique appeared larger.

<b>

The already tattered jacket and shirt were stripped away, revealing a bulging physique that bore no resemblance to his original slender body.

Beneath that skin, thick, vein-like tubes bulged, occasionally writhing grotesquely.

With pride in his undamaged body, Van stepped forward.

However, the wound on his side inflicted by Arvin still smoldered with white smoke, unhealed.

<b>

"Well, that's fine. It seems the harvest is already complete. It's about time to take my leave."

<b>

"Unfortunately, you won't be able to escape this barrier."

<b>

William stepped forward, crunching the glass scattered in the garden as he approached Van.

<b>

"Is that so?"

<b>

In response to William's words, Van wore a defiant smile and suddenly raised both hands upwards.

<b>

"I would have been happy to trample you... But if my business is done, it seems I should return. You should be grateful for my mercy."

"How shamelessly you make excuses for defeat!"

<b>

Just as Arvin shouted, William caught sight of something above Van.

He instinctively restrained Arvin, shielding himself with his shield.

<b>

At that moment, lightning struck Van, enveloping the area in a flash of light.

The thunderous roar split the air, shaking the surroundings, and Van barely managed to hold his ground against the shock.

<b>

"'Thunder God's Strike'?!"

<b>

As the shock subsided, William looked around in surprise.

<b>

"Did he just break through the barrier? To attack here...?"

<b>

William narrowed his eyes at the charred humanoid object rolling where Van had just been.

<b>

"Did he eliminate the evidence to cover his tracks?"

<b>

The smoking object was clearly once a person.

It had likely been carbonized in an instant by the recent thunder. This one was like that, but the one who used it treated others as disposable tools.

William couldn't hide his disgust at such a person's sensibility.

<b>

<b>

"That's not it. This one isn't him."

<b>

Alicia denied William's thoughts from behind.

<b>

"It's similar to Carla's decoy. He switched bodies. He managed to escape."

<b>

"Could it be that he used 'Target Exchange'? That's a living target?!"

"Strictly speaking, it's not alive; the target is a vampire... an 'undead.'"

<b>

Colin, who had come out from indoors, also shared his insight. "Target Exchange" is a spell that can swap two objects located at a certain distance from each other.

The target is strictly an object, and it's common knowledge that living beings cannot be moved.

Colin argued that this time, the target was not a "living being."

<b>

"I was definitely closing in on him... I never thought he could escape this barrier."

<b>

Jessica, who had emerged while holding onto Victor's arm, expressed her regret.

<b>

"I'm not strong enough... Not at all! I'm completely lacking in power!!!"

<b>

Arvin's frustrated shout echoed, filled with regret.

Jessica gently tapped Arvin's head with her fist.
