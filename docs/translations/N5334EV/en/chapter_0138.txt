# 126 Annie's Sword

Annie said, "I'll take care of it myself!" and it was soon to be two weeks.

<blank>

Initially, it caused quite a stir, but Annie was allowed to do so by getting some promises from her father, Philip.

<blank>

One, always work with the twins and never let them out of your sight.

One, work should be limited to one hour after school.

One, when the twins finish work, get them home safely. And when you do, be sure to have Irving accompany you.

<blank>

By keeping these promises, Annie was allowed to work in Toby's Diner with the twins.

<blank>

The job was to clean up the mess hall, which Annie was more than happy to do.

I sweep the floor with a broom and polish the table, remembering what Susie told me and what she taught me. Suzy's words, "If you use your body with a keen awareness of each and every one of your household chores, you will get a good workout.

And remembering Susie's lesson, "Keep your body in balance, relax, and put your strength where it needs to be," Annie could not help but look forward to the labor she would perform.

<blank>

Annie also taught the twins how to do what Suzy had taught them, "Do it as if you were doing a workout! and they work together, teaching them how to do it with a sense of pride.

<blank>

The presence of two young children who listened to her and adored her was a new joy for Annie.

<blank>

Eating fruit water and sweetmeats together with the three of us after work is also a truly enjoyable time.

<blank>

The past two weeks have been the most joyful and fulfilling time Annie has ever had.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And there was one more condition added by Philippe in sending and picking up the twins.

<blank>

That is, whenever you walk with your twin in the city, you must wear a bandage.

<blank>

From Philippe's point of view, this is like a talisman to protect his daughter.

<blank>

But this made Annie extraordinarily happy.

Whatever her father's intentions, it was nothing more than a reward for her willingness to work hard.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the past, when there was an aristocratic system, it was common practice for students of Miria Castel Eye to be allowed to wear a sword belt outside of the school.

The reason for this was to let others know that they were the children of nobles, and also because it was a symbol of power.

<blank>

<blank>

But today, with the abolition of the aristocratic system, students rarely wear a sword in the streets.

However, there are exceptions among them.

<blank>

In the case of ordinary students, when they are engaged in service activities called "off-campus training," they may be allowed to wear a sword belt for self-defense purposes.

<blank>

The other is those who are enrolled in the "knighthood" program or are confirmed to become knights. In other words, they are students who are required to serve as knight candidates.

<blank>

It is also the "proof" of those who protect others.

<blank>

<blank>

Therefore, Annie Cloud felt very proud that she was now allowed to be a belt holder.

<blank>

The sword at his waist has a sheath and handle that are made to look real, but the sword it holds is only a mock-up, a wooden sword with silver leaf on it.

<blank>

Still, Annie was proud.

Even if the object hanging from his waist was not real, the fact that he was allowed to wear a sword belt made him feel that he had come a little closer to the people he admired and loved.

<blank>

Today, he proudly walks with the twins after work to take them home, as if to protect them.

The eyes of the people in the city watching them are also mildly warm.

<blank>

<blank>

Come on." Dan! Nan! Let's go!"

Yes, Annie! Annie, baby girl!"

I'm going to go to the gym and try to get some sleep! Annie, baby girl!"

<blank>

Today, with the twins in tow, Annie is dashing to the orphanage where they live.

<blank>

The people of the city, who had become accustomed to seeing this scene over the past two weeks, watched the girls with a sense of relief.

Occasionally, "Good job! Ganbari na!" and the like. Annie cheerfully replies, and the twins are handed candy balls and other treats with the words, "Eat them later.

This was also becoming a standard exchange.

<blank>

<blank>

Irving, who followed close behind, was no stranger to this.

He was already recognized as a "knight candidate" and allowed to wear a sword belt in the city, despite the fact that he was only a freshman.

<blank>

The sword Irving now wears is not his beloved two-handed sword, but a short sword provided by the school.

Irving thought that although it was a little inadequate, it would be enough for the city.

<blank>

If it were against the magical beasts of the Amkamu Forest, it would be a rather unsafe weapon, but this is not the forest.

I put my hand on the handle, thinking that this easy-to-handle tool might be more convenient to use here.

<blank>

However, Philip had told me to be vigilant, even in the city. This was due to the recent spate of disturbing incidents.

<blank>

Philip suspects that the recent incidents are probably related to the "back door".

<blank>

Backdoor-related incidents had been reported for several years, but most of them had occurred in slums or surrounding towns.

This month, however, the number of such incidents has been visibly increasing, and finally, last week, several similar incidents began to be reported from the civic district.

<blank>

The civic street is the district that was called the commoner's street when there was an aristocratic system.

The south side of the city was once divided across the Maggalat River as the aristocratic district. The north side was divided into commoners.

<blank>

Today, there are ordinary, quiet residential areas with small and large homes and apartments, commercial areas with small and large stores, and industrial areas with factories and small and medium-sized industrial facilities.

This living area of the general public begins in the middle of the river at Ulub Island and extends to the north of the river.

<blank>

There are also many bars and other entertainment areas on both sides of the island where manual laborers come to relax after a hard day's work.

<blank>

Although the facility where the twins live is on the south bank of the Maguarat River, its entertainment district is just a stone's throw away. It is not a good environment for children to live in.

<blank>

However, it was unlikely that any mistakes would occur. However, Irving was strongly advised by Philip to be vigilant.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Eventually, the familiar destination, the facility where the twins live, came into view.

The building is a blue-purple gabled structure with a steeply pitched triangular roof like a peaked hat.

It is built downtown, so it is built in close proximity to other houses.

The cobblestone road, which can hardly be said to be in good condition, is barely wide enough for wagons to pass each other.

<blank>

Irving's brow furrowed slightly as he continued down the gently sloping, straight path that led to the facility.

<blank>

Annie, hold on a second. Hey, Dan, Nan. Are those the guys you know?"

<blank>

Irving stepped forward to the three and slightly opened his lowered right hand as if to say, "Wait. The twins looked at each other and immediately shook their heads, "I don't know" and "I've never seen it before.

<blank>

A man who did not appear to be a hardened man was standing with his body leaning against the wall next to the entrance of the building.

Irving also noticed that there were several men lurking at the corners of the street leading to the alley, as if they were watching him.

<blank>

<blank>

I see," Irving mutters as he rattles his neck in a kokiri kiri manner.

<blank>

This is the reason why Miss Koh came to me unusually yesterday and today, saying something like, "Have a safe trip. You mean that she had somehow caught on to my movements?

<blank>

Is it Annie you're after? Or the twins?

Oh well, we'll just have to hear it directly from them.

<blank>

I've been a little stressed lately.

<blank>

On campus, I came with more care and restraint than I should have.

And yet, Bibi and his friends are proudly talking about how they have beaten up the street thugs.

So this time, it's my turn, right?

<blank>

Thinking of this, Irving's mouth relaxed slightly and he stepped forward.
