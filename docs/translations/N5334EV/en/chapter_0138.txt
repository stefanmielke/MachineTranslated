# Chapter 126 Annie's Sword

It had been nearly two weeks since Annie declared, "Leave it to me!"

<b>

At first, it caused quite a stir, but Annie was allowed to take that action by securing several promises from her father, Philip.

<b>

One, she would always work alongside the twins, never taking her eyes off them and looking after them.

One, she would only work for one hour after school.

One, when the twins finished their work, she would safely escort them home, and at that time, she would always have Irvin accompany her.

<b>

By keeping these promises, Annie was permitted to work with the twins at Toby's diner.

<b>

The job was cleaning inside the diner, but Annie approached it with joy.

Remembering what Suzy had told her and taught her, she swept the floor with a broom and polished the tables. "If you consciously use your body for each movement of housework, it will be good training," Suzy's words echoed in her mind.

And the labor, performed while recalling Suzy's teachings of "balancing your body, relaxing unnecessary strength, and applying necessary strength where needed," was nothing but a pleasure for Annie.

<b>

Annie proudly taught the twins the methods she learned from Suzy, saying, "Do it as if you're training!" while working together.

<b>

The presence of the two young ones, who listened to her words and looked up to her, was a refreshing joy for Annie.

<b>

Sharing the fruit water and sweets served after work together was truly a delightful moment.

<b>

These two weeks had been a time filled with unprecedented joy and fulfillment for Annie.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

And as she escorted the twins, another condition was added by Philip.

<b>

That was, whenever walking through the city with the twins, she must always wear a sword.

<b>

From Philip's perspective, this was like a charm to protect his daughter.

<b>

However, this made Annie exceptionally happy.

Regardless of her father's intentions, it was nothing less than a reward that boosted her motivation.

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the past, when the noble system existed, students of Miria Castle Eye were commonly allowed to wear swords outside of school.

This was to signify that they were the children of nobles and was also a symbol of power.

<b>

<b>

However, in modern times, after the abolition of the noble system, it is rare for students to wear swords in the city.

Yet, there are exceptions.

<b>

For general students, wearing swords may be permitted during volunteer activities known as "off-campus training," which also serves a self-defense purpose.

<b>

Another exception is for those enrolled in the "Knight Course" or those confirmed to become knights. In other words, students required to fulfill duties as knight candidates.

<b>

This is also a "proof" of those who protect others.

<b>

<b>

Therefore, Annie Cloud felt a great sense of pride in being allowed to wear a sword.

<b>

However, what hung at her waist was not a real sword but a wooden sword with a silver foil covering, though the sheath and handle were made with a craftsmanship that resembled the real thing.

<b>

Even so, Annie felt proud.

The fact that she was allowed to wear a sword, even if it wasn't real, made her feel a little closer to the people she deeply admired.

<b>

Today, after finishing work, she proudly walked alongside the twins to escort them home.

The eyes of the townspeople watching them were warm and gentle.

<b>

<b>

"Alright! Dan! Nan! Let's go!"

"Yes! Annie big sister!"

"Okay! Annie big sister!"

<b>

Today too, Annie strides confidently towards the care facility where the twins live.

<b>

The townspeople, who had grown accustomed to this sight over the past two weeks, watched their figures with warmth.

Occasionally, they would call out, "Good job!" or "Keep it up!" to which Annie cheerfully replied, while the twins received candies and such with "Eat this later."

This too was becoming a standard exchange.

<b>

<b>

Irvin, who followed behind, was also accustomed to it.

Despite being a new first-year student who had just enrolled, he was already recognized as a "knight candidate" and permitted to wear a sword in the city.

<b>

The sword Irvin currently carried was not his beloved two-handed sword but a short sword provided by the academy.

Though he felt somewhat unsatisfied, he thought it would be sufficient for the city.

<b>

If he were facing the magical beasts of Amukam Forest, this weapon would feel a bit lacking, but this was not the forest.

Rather, he thought that this manageable sword might be more practical here, placing his hand on its grip.

<b>

However, Philip had advised him to remain vigilant even in the city, as there had been a series of unsettling incidents recently.

<b>

Philip suspected that the recent incidents were likely related to the so-called "Backdoor."

<b>

Reports of incidents related to the Backdoor had been coming in for several years, but most of them occurred in the slums or surrounding towns.

However, since this month, the number of such incidents had visibly increased, and finally, last week, similar reports began to emerge from the citizen's district.

<b>

The citizen's district was the area that was once referred to as the commoner's district during the time of the noble system.

In the past, the Maguarat River divided the southern side as the noble district and the northern side as the commoner district.

<b>

Currently, the area is lined with various sizes of houses and apartments, forming a quiet residential area, as well as commercial districts filled with shops of all sizes and industrial districts with small factories and facilities.

This area of ordinary citizens' living begins from Ulbu Island, which is a river island, and spreads to the north side of the river.

<b>

Moreover, entertainment districts such as taverns where manual laborers unwind after work are plentiful on both sides of Ulbu Island.

<b>

The facility where the twins live is located on the southern bank of the Maguarat River, but the entertainment district is very close by. It is not an ideal environment for children to live in.

<b>

That said, it shouldn't be too dangerous. However, Irvin had been strongly advised by Philip to remain vigilant.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Eventually, the familiar destination where the twins lived came into view.

The building had a sharply sloped triangular roof resembling a pointed hat, constructed in a blue-purple gable style.

Being a lower-class construction, it was tightly built next to other houses.

The cobbled road, which could hardly be called well-maintained, was just wide enough for a horse-drawn carriage to barely pass by.

<b>

As Irvin walked along the gently sloping straight road leading to the facility, he slightly furrowed his brow.

<b>

"Annie, wait a moment. Hey Dan, Nan. Do you know those people over there?"

<b>

Irvin stepped forward in front of the three and slightly opened his lowered right hand as if to signal them to stop. The twins looked at each other and immediately shook their heads, saying, "I don't know," "I've never seen them."

<b>

A man who did not appear to be a decent person was leaning against the wall next to the entrance of the building.

Irvin also noticed that several men were lurking at the corners of the alley, watching the situation.

<b>

<b>

Cracking his neck, Irvin muttered, "I see."

<b>

So that’s why the boss unusually said, "Be careful out there." Was she somehow picking up on the situation?

<b>

Are they targeting Annie? Or the twins?

Well, whatever, I can just ask them directly.

<b>

I've been a bit stressed out lately.

<b>

At school, I’ve been overly cautious and holding back.

Yet, Bibi and the others are boasting about beating up the thugs in the city.

So this time, I guess it's my turn, right?

<b>

Thinking this, Irvin slightly relaxed his mouth and stepped forward.
