# 36 Children of Amkam Part 1

Children side

Depressing development. There are some cruel descriptions. Please be careful if you do not like it.


----------------

<blank>

The 5 bells? Is everyone here? Is Fiorina back?"

He hasn't... come back yet.

<blank>

As the sound of the alarm bell reaches the school, Colin checks to see if there are any children inside.

But Fiorina is not ready yet, Eva Avans told Colin with concern.

<blank>

'So..., a little late? OK! Bibi, Mia, you two take everyone to the training hall. I'll pick up Fiorina from the classroom, please."

<blank>

<blank>

5 bells Type 3 alert.

It's the early stages of Amkam's magical beast alert.

Alarm bells are sounded when a magical beast enters the safe zone of the forest and there is a risk of magical beast damage.

Until the warning is lifted, we must remain vigilant.

<blank>

When the alarm bell is sounded, the children in the school are supposed to evacuate to the most solid building, the training hall.

In particular, children on lower floors, who have little or no fighting ability, must be evacuated as a priority.

<blank>

Colin left the children in the hands of the two higher-ranking staff members and ran to the classroom building to look for Fiorina, who was supposed to be still in the school.

<blank>

<blank>

Fiorina! She's not here? That's strange, it's a straight road... but you don't think she's in the school?

<blank>

Colin hurriedly left the classroom to look around the school again and turned his attention to his office in the same building.

I noticed something move out of the corner of my eye and looked in that direction.

<blank>

Fiorina? Are you there?"

<blank>

Colin called out fearfully.

Then, a figure wanders into view from the dark, sunless interior of the office. It is Fiorina.

<blank>

Don't startle me, Fiorina! What's the matter? What are you doing here?"

<blank>

Caught off guard by the sudden appearance of a figure, Colin momentarily chokes.

But when she realized it was Fiorina, she let out a breath of relief.

But there is something wrong with her. Why is she here? Her complexion is not good. Her expression is blank. Maybe she is not feeling well.

<blank>

What's wrong?" Fiorina. Are you sick? Are you okay? Can you walk by yourself?"

<blank>

<blank>

Come to think of it, the alarm bells went off when I was alone in an empty classroom.

There is no reason not to be discouraged.

<blank>

We're going to be okay, okay? Let's go back to the others, okay?"

<blank>

Colin holds out his hand to Fiorina.

But I suddenly noticed that her hand was holding something.

<blank>

(Hand? (Hand? A child's hand?)

<blank>

Fiorina is holding the hand of a child who looks younger than she is.

I continued to look around... and this time I made a small noise and my body tensed up.

In the shadows, the face of a white child was floating in the air.

<blank>

But upon closer inspection, it could be seen that Fiorina was holding the boy's hand and they were standing side by side.

<blank>

<blank>

I said, "Oh, my God! I told you not to scare me. Fiorina! Who is that girl? Where is she from?

He said, "You know, I was lost outside, so I brought you inside. So I brought him inside."

"Yeah, my sister let me in."

<blank>

The two of them explain to Colin, but he doesn't get the gist of it at this point.

<blank>

'Well... I wonder if she's a relative of someone? Did you come looking for someone?"

<blank>

Fiorina responded vaguely to Colin's question, "Oh, yes.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm not sure why you're here. We need to get back to the others as soon as possible!"

<blank>

I don't know what's going on, but now that the alarm has sounded, we can't stay here forever.

Colin decided to take them for now. But....

<blank>

I'm looking for something. It's important.

Yeah, I'm looking for something.

"Looking for something? Speaking of which, where's Eva's basket? You don't have it, do you? Are you looking for her basket? You didn't find it in the classroom?"

<blank>

Fiorina does not have the basket she was supposed to have come for.

Colin noticed this and asked, but at the same time the alarm bells rang again.

<blank>

4-2? Oh no, we have to join up with the others quickly! Hurry up, Fiorina!

<blank>

Colin takes Fiorina's hand and tries to pull her along, but she doesn't even twitch.

Colin is shocked that Fiorina, who is smaller than he is, does not move.

<blank>

What's wrong? Fiorina! We have to go quickly! Why aren't you moving?"

I'm looking for something. I have to find it."

Yeah, we need to find them."

What are you looking for? Not a basket? Fiorina! What the hell is wrong with you?

It's important. I have to find it."

<blank>

<blank>

This is not going to get us anywhere.

What in the world is wrong with Fiorina?

If you look closely, you will see that they are not looking at you when they talk to you.

His eyes are vacant. What happened?

The child she is with is also strange. Her complexion is just white.

I know she is dressed in black, but only her face seems to stand out in these shadows.

<blank>

And why is it so dark here?

Even though there is no sunlight and the shadows are deep, it is still too dark.

<blank>

It's as if...well, it's as if we have entered the darkness, not the shadows.

Colin felt a chill crawl up his spine and a cold sweat run down his back.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The children were assembled in the training hall.

The training hall is supposed to be large, but when all the students are there, it feels a certain density.

In the midst of all this, William was taking roll call of the children and checking the personnel.

<blank>

"4-2...hasn't it been a long time since a hexenbiest came through the safe zone?"

<blank>

Carl Giacobini muttered to no one in particular as he toyed with the tact in his hand.

<blank>

<blank>

'We're having a harvest festival next month, and I don't want them tearing up the harvest!

<blank>

For some reason, Alan Edgarra, hands on hips, sniffs roughly.

<blank>

Why are you being such a pompous ass? Alan, are you really that enthusiastic about the Harvest Festival?"

What are you talking about, Carl? The harvest festival is a big, exciting event! You're not a man if you don't put your back into it!

<blank>

I still don't think it's any of your business.

I've decided to compete this year! I've decided to play the game this year!"

No, well, whether you play the game or not, that's your business."

I'm going to invite Susie to the Harvest Festival this year! I'm taking Susie to the Harvest Festival!"

<blank>

A few pairs of ears twitched at that cryptic remark.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm like, "Oh, come on! You've got to be kidding me!"

I said, "Wait a minute, Alan. That's a careless remark."

"Hmm, Alan doesn't think too much..."

<blank>

Irving, Lombardo, and Belknap come up to Alan.　Carl looked up to the heavens and wondered if this was a pattern that would end in his being crushed before he could even get up the nerve to do anything about it.

<blank>

<blank>

I said, "So! Why do you guys keep breathing together like that!"

It's because you said something stupid! I won't allow you to do that!"

<blank>

Irving rolls in his breath and crowds Alan. The other two nodded yes.

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell? It's up to me who I invite! Besides! I don't need someone who already knows who I'm going with!

"Oh, you...what are you talking about?"

<blank>

Irving was instantly sniffling when Alan fired back.

<blank>

Damn it!" You're doing a good job! Irving's going to burn!

I'll tell you what," he said! That's stupid! I didn't do anything! I haven't even decided if I'm going with you this year!

<blank>

Irving, who has turned bright red, fumbles to deny it, but....

<blank>

<blank>

'Hmmm...I see! You haven't decided? !"

<blank>

Irving heard a voice from just behind him, and he jerked back reflexively.

A feeling of cold water being poured over my back.

<blank>

What?" ...Bibi? ...Yes, how long have you been there ......?"

'Hmph! I've been here all this time!"

<blank>

Lombardo, who senses the air of danger immediately, grabs Alain by the neck, takes Belknap and Karl with him, and moves away from the scene.

<blank>

<blank>

"No, no, no, no, I mean, I don't know, I mean..."

I don't care who Irving invites! Whoever Irving invites..., that's up to Irving! It's not like that ......, it's not like that, it's not like that, it's not like that, it's not like that, Sue or Mia! He can invite whoever he wants!"

No! Wait, Bibi! That's not what I meant..."

Don't! Don't touch me!"

<blank>

Irving reached for Beatrice's shoulder, but Beatrice brushed it off and stared up at Irving from below with moist eyes.

<blank>

"...... Bibi... you... so! I'm..."

<blank>

Just as Irving was about to tell Beatrice something, the sound of an alarm bell echoing violently from far away caused a commotion in the training hall.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

3-2? Everybody get your gear on immediately! Colin! Colin? Where's Colin?

Will, Colin isn't back yet.

<blank>

Mia tells William with concern.

<blank>

What? No way! Shit! ...Willie! Dana! This is the part where I ask you! Let the low-ranking kids get their gear! I'll go activate the warding device!"

<blank>

<blank>

The warding device is a magical tool installed in this school.

Now that a special alert has been issued, it must be activated quickly to set up protective wards and encircle the school.

But its activation cannot be done by the children.

William is the only one who has the authority to activate it here and now.

<blank>

I am concerned about Colin, who has yet to return, but the first thing to do is to activate the warding.

Leaving the situation to the two oldest men, William ran out of the training hall.

<blank>

<blank>

The office where the activation equipment is located is about 30 meters south of the training hall.

William ran, stopping to fasten the clasp on the breastplate of his equipment, which he had prepared when the first bell rang.

The boots are already on.

By the time I slipped the glove that was my cuirass through my arm, I had reached my office in the main building of the school.

<blank>

<blank>

William opened the door to his office with great force and jumped inside.

And immediately I realized that she was there.

<blank>

Colin! Why are you here? Is Fiorina with you?

Will?

<blank>

Colin was in the Oval Office.

In Colin's arms is Fiorina, whom she went looking for.

When William saw the way she was being held by Colin, bloodless, he decided that Colin was having difficulty getting her to go.

<blank>

Both of you, hurry up and get to the others!"

<blank>

William is relieved to see Colin, and heads for the shelf where the warding device is located.

<blank>

Will! No! Please be careful!

"Colin? I know. So I need you to hurry up and get your gear ready in the training hall."

<blank>

William instructs Colin to take immediate precautions and quickly holds his hand out to the double doors at the top of the shelves.

The door was unlocked by magic power and the activation device for the protective warding installed inside was taken out.

<blank>

<blank>

'What, that's where it was?'

<blank>

<blank>

Immediately after the unidentified voice was heard, a shadow with mass became a myriad of spears and struck William.

The shadow destroyed the north wall of the Oval Office, and William was knocked out of the building with no way to get out.

<blank>

Gah!"

<blank>

William's body was blown violently, bouncing off the ground several times before finally coming to a stop in the middle of the yard.

<blank>

Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Willooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！"

<blank>

Colin's screams echoed through the courtyard.

Colin, with Fiorina in his arms, ran through the destroyed wall toward William.

<blank>

<blank>

Both of these sisters said they didn't know where this was. I was in trouble.

<blank>

Something wrapped in a black shadow and taking the form of a boy emerged from the destroyed wall.

In his hand, he held the activation device that William had taken out and was playing with it in his hand as if it were a toy.

The hair on his head, which had been black, turned silver as he looked at it.

Although it was hard to tell from inside the room, the black clothes it was wearing were a butler's uniform.

<blank>

Either way, it looks like it had to be someone with authority to take it out, so thanks for the help, okay?"

<blank>

William puts his hands on the ground and strains to raise his body.

and when the force is applied to the pectoral muscles.

<blank>

Ka-ha!"

<blank>

He coughs up blood.

<blank>

(Damn! You've got a couple of ribs. Did you hurt your lungs?)

<blank>

William immediately passed his magic power through his breastplate and cast a restorative spell himself.

The equipment's magical markings react and begin to increase William's physical capabilities and assist in the healing of his wounds.

<blank>

Both their own recovery techniques and the assistance of their equipment are at the elementary end of the scale.

Wounds do not heal immediately.

But enough to move. Then Colin arrives, too.

<blank>

Will, Will! Are you okay? Can you move? Hold on! I need you to heal now!

It's okay, Colin. You take Fiorina and go join the others!"

Oh, no! Will, you're hurt! Quickly! We have to fix him!

This is not like this... this opponent is not so naive that he can get away with something like this! My, this is not an injury! Save your recovery. Don't use it for something like this! You stay in the rear and provide support!"

<blank>

<blank>

A look of bitterness comes over Colin's face.

Even she is aware of the current situation.

I don't think the person in front of me will miss the fact that I am consuming magic and time to recover here.

If that's the case, the right thing to do in this case is to get to everyone as quickly as possible while Will is still standing and defending himself.

That's what Will is saying.

<blank>

You use me as a shield, and you run away!　And.

<blank>

I know that.

Even if I knew that, there was no way I could leave Will behind as a shield!　Colin's face contorts in anguish.

<blank>

<blank>

Soon the children emerged from the training hall, aware of the sound of destruction in the school building and the unusual situation.

<blank>

No, guys! Get back! Enemy attack! Get the kids inside!

<blank>

As if determined, Colin stood up with Fiorina in his arms, headed straight for the training hall, and shouted as he ran.

<blank>

<blank>

I wish you'd leave that sister behind."

<blank>

As the boy said this, the shadow he was clad in undulated, rose sharply like a spear, and was thrust forward at high speed.

Several black spears pass by William, but he cannot react.

<blank>

The black spear pierced Korin's right shoulder and left tibia, and then sewn into the ground.

Immediately thereafter, the shadowy spear vanishes, as if dissolving and dissipating into water.

<blank>

Gee! Aaghiiiiiiiii!!!!"

<blank>

Colin's screams echoed around the area as he hit the ground.

Fiorina was separated from Colin and thrown to the ground.

Colin was on the spot, gasping in extreme pain as blood poured from his shoulder and shin.

<blank>

William felt his consciousness rising as he watched the blood stain Colin's shoulder.

Far off in the distance, you can barely make out two alarm bells ringing twice each.

<blank>

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you... ！！！！

<blank>

Instead of shielding himself, he allowed Colin to be hurt in front of him!

William turned to the boy and lunged at him, emitting a rage.

<blank>

The weapon in his hand is a short sword.

His original beloved longsword was not brought to Amcam this time.

It was borrowed by Howard for self-defense.

But even though the blade is somewhat small, the performance of the weapon is high.

<blank>

<blank>

The boy twisted his mouth in amusement and sent a shadow flying at William.

William rushes forward, quickly weaving in and out of the black spears that are thrust out at high speed from the front, but the spears snatch and gouge his arms, legs, cheeks, and unprotected parts.

Still, he closes the gap to himself and strikes down with a single sword.

However, the boy shakes like a mirage and falls backward.

<blank>

Moreover, the boy's hand was holding the arm of Fiorina, who was supposed to have moved backward with Colin.

It's like dragging a doll.

<blank>

When did this happen? When did you do that?

<blank>

William grits his teeth in anguish.

I can't help but feel angry at myself for not only allowing Colin to be harmed, but also for easily handing over to the hands of the enemy the girl who had taken refuge in her own body.

<blank>

<blank>

AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"

<blank>

Suddenly, from behind, someone rushes forward with a yell.

<blank>

<blank>

Will, get out of my way!!!!!!!"

<blank>

Dana passed William and went toward the boy.

<blank>

'How dare you! How dare you Colin oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

He thrusts a series of spears at the boy, but the black spears always return the favor.

<blank>

<blank>

Damn! You oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

Still increasing his speed further, Dana unleashes his spear.

The high pitched sound of Dana's spear shooting hard objects echoed around the area like a drum hitting a series of beats.

Sweat is sprinkled from Dana's face as she concentrates.

The boy who watched the scene looked as if he was enjoying himself, and his mouth hung up in a wicked V-shape.

<blank>

<blank>

"Yo, come on! Dana, get down!

<blank>

William also steps forward and dispels a series of black spears that are closing in on Dana.

But the boy's eyes narrowed, his mouth hung further, and the number of ascending black spears increased quickly.

William quickly slides himself in front of Dana's body and handles the black spear, but he is outnumbered.

Although the fatal blow was averted, Dana and the others were sent flying backward.

<blank>

Aah!

Goooh!"

<blank>

Dana and William were sent flying backward four to five meters and rolling on the ground.

<blank>

Aaah!

<blank>

William was shocked again and fainted in agony on top of the wounds he had just received.

However, as soon as he tries to raise his body to a fighting stance, he sees a black spear shot out after him.

<blank>

（I can't get to it in time!)

<blank>

At this rate, the spear will reach them before they can assume a defensive posture.

It is not good to eat that thing now! But I can't keep up with my body movements.

Out of the corner of my eye, I can also see that Dana is still unable to get up.

We are both going to be killed! Just when I thought that, a figure stood before me.

Immediately after, the sound of metal creaking and being struck echoes through the air.

<blank>

Lombard Blouk stood in front of them and held out his tower shield, a large shield, to prevent the black spear from reaching them.

Beside him, Irvin Haggard was slashing away with his longsword at the black spears that Lombardo had failed to cover.

<blank>

Stand up! Both of you! No time to sleep!

<blank>

Irving exclaims.

<blank>

Colin's fine! I stopped the bleeding!"

<blank>

Willie Hodgson, who was performing a healing technique on Colin, also shouted.

<blank>

Guys! Step back! Keep your distance!

<blank>

At Beatrice's instruction, the four began to retreat.

Colin, who has regained consciousness, also drops backwards with Mia supporting him...

<blank>

<blank>

Wait! Please wait! Take her... take Fiorina!

<blank>

Colin tried to call a halt while Mia was on his shoulder.

<blank>

Calm down, Colin! Think about getting yourself in shape now! Otherwise... we're all going to be overrun!"

"......!"

<blank>

Beatrice's harsh words make Colin shush.

<blank>

<blank>

What the hell is this guy?

<blank>

Dana glared at the boy and questioned him.

<blank>

It's the enemy! Some kind of demon... and a higher one at that!"

<blank>

William answered, again using the art of recovery on his own wounds.

<blank>

He's a vampire. Fiorina... she's unconscious because he took her blood!"

<blank>

Colin revealed the boy's identity with a sad face.

Everyone's eyes widened and buzzed in astonishment at Colin's words.

Willie muttered, "No wonder he never leaves the shade.

<blank>

What the hell is that? Why the hell is that guy here?

I couldn't care less about that right now!"

I know! So? What are you going to do about it, Will!"

<blank>

<blank>

...... for help."

<blank>

Colin broke away from Mia, who was borrowing his shoulder, and spoke the words.

Mia stopped me, telling me not to walk yet, but I smiled back, "I'm fine, thank you," and quietly walked away.

<blank>

We can't do anything about it, let alone Will. All we can do now is buy time.

<blank>

Colin's statement silences them all.

<blank>

But how? How do we call for help? The smoke bomb was supposed to be around the wall where I got blown away, right?"

<blank>

Mia expressed her doubts.

<blank>

<blank>

I'll ring the bell.

<blank>

Colin turned his gaze to the bell tower standing in the school building.

<blank>

'Let the bell ring and let the whole village know that the school is in danger. The rest of us will stay in the training hall to defend ourselves!"

<blank>

The walls of the training hall are solidly built to withstand the training for battle inside, and they also have a solid magical seal to serve as a shelter.

It is different from the construction of a school building which is just a wall.

<blank>

<blank>

It's not really a defensive strategy for me.

You must understand the difference between us and them! Reckless fighting is not what warriors do!"

"Shit! I know.

That's what I'm talking about! Think of it as training for a defensive fight, and you'll be fine!"

It's not about training. It's defensive warfare itself."

<blank>

<blank>

"Well? Who's going to the bell?"

<blank>

Irving asked, looking around at everyone.

<blank>

<blank>

I'll go.

<blank>

Suddenly, there was a voice answering from behind me.

<blank>

Stefan? When did you leave the training hall!"

No, you can't! This is a job for the higher ranks! The children of the lower and middle ranks should stay inside the training hall! Alan! Belknap! You can do this!

<blank>

Beatrice rejects Stefan's suggestion and instructs Alain, a scout apprentice, and Belknap, a skilled escort, from the 7th ranks in the rear.

Belknap and Alain replied with a wry smile, "Oh, leave it to us!　Belknap and Alan replied with a wry smile.

<blank>

<blank>

I'll go! Sue always praises me! She says I'm the best in school at making her feel uncomfortable! That's why it's best if I go!

<blank>

Still, Stefan persists, and William...

<blank>

Okay. Stefan, you go. Alan, Belknap. You will be Stefan's bodyguard and assistants.

Will? Are you out of your mind? Stefan is still in the middle!

<blank>

Beatrice's protests do not change William's decision.

<blank>

'This operation is best done by those who are quick and stealthy. Stefan, Alan and Belknap. Can you do it?"

One of us is enough. Two of us are slowing me down!"

Stefan! Stefan! I'm leaving you!

"No, it's okay. I'll protect you both."

The basic rule is that three people should work together on an operation. This is the same in the Protectorate. If you can't do it, you can't be a member of the group.

<blank>

William's words are followed by the three men's words of approval.

<blank>

<blank>

We have to be on the defensive while keeping the enemy in check! All we have to do is to keep the enemy in check while we defend ourselves."

<blank>

William informs the mission while receiving the kite shield given to Mary Frank.

<blank>

Willie, Colin, Beatrice. You guys are going to start the operation right away with a blindfold to check and defensive magic. After that, focus on healing. Lombard and I will shield here. Irving, Dana, you deal with what we can't handle. Don't go forward to attack! That shadow spear will disappear in the sun. But the number of moves is extraordinary! Don't get attached to one, prepare for the next one! Attack from a distance, Mia, use Carl's magic, Helena, use Mary's bow!

But what if the arrow hits Fiorina? She still has his hand on her..."

<blank>

Mary mentioned her concerns as she checked the bowstring she was using.

<blank>

We don't need to let the attack reach him. The purpose is to check and blind him. It is enough to aim at the oncoming black spear or drop it in front of him.

<blank>

The long-distance group nodded in agreement.

<blank>

<blank>

Everyone listened intently to William's words and turned their attention to what they needed to do.

<blank>

Stefan, Alan, Belknap! As soon as we start attacking, you head for the bell tower! Go around to the east magic building from the back of the training hall and be quick! Once you've rang the bells, you'll exit the school as quickly as possible! Tell the Protectorate about this situation as fast as you can!

<blank>

The three nodded together.

<blank>

Listen, there's a limit to how long you can stall for help. And the enemy is a vampire. Once the sun goes down, you have no chance. Remember, there is a time limit! Everyone ready?

<blank>

Oh!　and everyone replies back.

<blank>

<blank>

A silver-haired boy watched it with amusement.

<blank>

I think we've waited long enough. I think we've waited long enough. Can we get started?"

<blank>

The shadows around the boy wriggle and rise.

<blank>

Tch! It's coming! Begin defensive deployment!

<blank>

William and Lombardo stepped forward and held up their shields.

Behind them, Colin, Willie, and Beatrice began their own celebratory chanting.

<blank>

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Colin Saunders, daughter of Saunders of Amukam, appeals to Zilph, the leader of the great winds, to protect us from those who would avenge us through the power of the wind. By the power of the wind, protect us from the avenger.

<blank>

Defensive magic of the wind attribute.

It creates a layer of air to reduce the power of attack from the enemy, and distorts the atmosphere to shift sight and reduce hit rates.

<blank>

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Willy Hodgson, son of Hodgson of Amukam, seeks and appeals to Salamander, the Great Leader of the Fire. Give us the radiance of life with the flame of your life.

<blank>

Fire-attribute support magic.

It shares the life force of the flame with those around it, stimulating cellular activation and improving physical ability and resilience.

<blank>

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Beatrice Croqui, daughter of Croqui, who is connected to Amcam, seeks and appeals to the Gnomes, the custodians of the earth. 'Let there be a break between me and my enemies by the will of the rock! ≪The Rock Wall."

<blank>

Earth-based defensive magic.

He builds a wall of stone from the earth to create a barrier between himself and his enemies.

<blank>

A wall of stone, created by Beatrice's spirit magic, rose up one after another, surrounding and covering the boy.

<blank>

<blank>

Long range! Begin the attack!"

<blank>

Helena and Mary both shot arrows, and Mia and Carl chanted up the offensive celebration.

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Mia Mathisun, daughter of Mathisun, who is connected to Amukam, seeks and appeals to Nome, the leader of the great earth. Let the power of the earth strike down my enemies! ≪Sand Shot!"

<blank>

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Carl Giacobini, son of Giacobini, who is a member of the Amukamu, appeals to Salamander, the Great Fire Leader. Let the power of his fire consume our enemies! ≪FIRE SHOT!

<blank>

A magic circle was deployed in front of them as they chanted the celebratory words of spirit magic.

Pebbles from Mia's magic circle and small fireballs from Carl's were shot out one after another toward the boy.

A cloud of dust suddenly obscured the view of the area.

<blank>

<blank>

Now! Go!"

<blank>

At the same time, William sent instructions to the three men in the rear.

Stefan, Alan, and Belknap run to the back of the magic building on the left and disappear.

<blank>

<blank>

Here it comes." Hold on!"

<blank>

Almost simultaneously with William's cry, the stone wall shattered as if exploding, and countless black spears came surging through it.

The wall of wind penetrated through without any obstacle and approached William and his team.

William and Lombard prevented them with their shields, while Irving and Dana slashed and knocked them down with their spears and longswords.

<blank>

<blank>

However, the countless black spears that were unleashed were sure to injure the bodies of the vanguard.

<blank>

Gooooooooooooo!"

Aah! Gah!"

<blank>

Irving's cheeks are snatched and gouged out of his side, Dana's arms and thighs are snatched and gouged out of hers.

<blank>

<blank>

Mia stopped blinding the stone gravel and used one higher level of magic.

<blank>

"Crush! ≪Lock Block!"

<blank>

Basketball-sized chunks of rock rained down on the enemy one after another.

The black spears are either blocked, shifted out of their path, or crushed to reduce the number of consecutive blows.

<blank>

In the few margins that were created, Colin and Beatrice performed recovery techniques on Dana and Irvin.

<blank>

<blank>

And the black spear attack suddenly stopped.

<blank>

"How's it going? Is everything going as planned?"

<blank>

The boy asks, his mouth twisted in amusement.

<blank>

<blank>

Neither William nor Lombard, who holds the shield, is unscathed.

Willie held out his hand to William to help him recover, but he said he was fine and put Lombard first.

<blank>

Both Irvin and Dana have stopped bleeding but are breathing heavily.

<blank>

(This wear and tear after only around 10 minutes... how much longer can this hold up?)

<blank>

Looking behind them, Colin and Beatrice also understood the severity of the situation and their expressions were grim.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, yeah! I got this for a reason that I don't want it to be used! There's a reason I don't want them to use it."

<blank>

The boy began to talk while playing with the warding device he had taken from me, as if he were playing a trick with it.

<blank>

The first thing to do is to make sure that you have a good understanding of what you are doing and how to do it. But with my family, it's a little tougher.

<blank>

<blank>

William is horrified to hear the words of the vampire in the form of a boy.

You think those wards are OK? You've got to be kidding me! It's much stronger than the magical markings on the training hall behind us. If they can get through, the walls of the training hall are as good as paper!

William loses color at this fact.

<blank>

<blank>

So, you know, I've decided to call our boys!"

<blank>

With that, he brought his ringed fingers close to his mouth and whistled with a hiss.

<blank>

Well, I can't use warding, so I could have called you anytime I wanted to ha ha ha ha ha."

<blank>

<blank>

A feeling of discomfort ran down William's spine.

Something is coming from every direction to this place now!

<blank>

The others seem to sense the presence as well, alert and watchful of their surroundings.

The sound of many somethings kicking the ground comes from the earth, and the sign of breaking wind comes from the sky.

<blank>

<blank>

They suddenly appeared. They appeared from the shadows of the school building in front of us, from the side of the training hall behind us, and from the sky all at once, coming toward us.

<blank>

All of you! Stand firm against the wall! Do not split up! Vanguard! Hold the front at all costs!

<blank>

(Not good! Shadowdog and Brutal Butt! Five or six of these kids should barely be able to take on one of them. It's still too much for these kids right now!)

<blank>

<blank>

William impatiently shielded the first shadow dog that rushed in ahead of him and thrust his sword at it.

<blank>

But each thrust is shallow. It immediately bares its fangs and leaps at you.

When it was once again shielded, Dana drove a spear into its side and Irvin slammed a longsword into its neck, finally killing one of them.

<blank>

<blank>

"Block! ≪'Rock Wall'.

<blank>

Beatrice magically spawns a wall of stone again.

This time, they deployed themselves and a barricade around the training ground.

With the load of magic deployed over a wide area at once, Beatrice lets out a small moan and falls to her knees.

<blank>

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude. Gnomes of the earth as administrators. Nymphe of the waters. Strength to the children of the earth! Commandment to our enemies! ≪Barbudo cargó."

<blank>

Mia combined the power of the higher, earth and water spirits to control the plants.

<blank>

The ground is broken and countless thorns overflow.

They entangle themselves around the feet of the shadow dogs, robbing them of their mobility and damaging them.

<blank>

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude. Shoot through my enemies with the power of your flame! ≪Fire Bullet."

<blank>

Carl shot out a flaming bullet and shot into the bat.

Mary and Helena shot arrows at the bat, which was engulfed in flames, and shot it down.

<blank>

<blank>

'Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 

<blank>

At that moment, a bell swung vigorously from the bell tower began to echo its sound.

<blank>

(Okay! First of all, we've achieved our goal. Now I'll have them all holed up in the training hall. The three of you who struck the bell should quickly retreat outside the school as agreed. If he goes after them... me!)

<blank>

William looked around cautiously, his brow furrowed, as if to brace himself.

Then, he puts his hand on the "control bead" that shines in the center of his own breastplate.

<blank>

It's ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. It sounded good, didn't it? I wonder if this one echoed through the whole village? Right? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."

<blank>

<blank>

Hey!

<blank>

William is appalled by the vampire's words.

What is this guy talking about?

That is the perplexity of all who heard those words.

<blank>

What's with this guy? Why is he acting like he knew the bell was going to ring?

<blank>

Dana expressed the question that everyone had, with a hint of caution.

<blank>

Why? Because I made them ring. Even if you didn't ring, I would have.

<blank>

Why... why would you do that?"

<blank>

Colin asked, pale.

<blank>

What?" Why?" ? Ha-ha-ha-ha. That's because, if I don't ring the bell, the villagers won't notice that I'm being attacked. Ha-ha-ha. I'll be sorry if I'm late for dinner because I'm late for ...... noticing."

<blank>

The light tone of his tone changed, and he concluded the last sentence with a heavy tone that did not match his appearance.

<blank>

Then stop playing around and give it to me.

What the hell, it was pretty funny."

<blank>

Suddenly another girl in black appeared on the spot.

<blank>

The girl, who looked about 12 years old, was dressed in the same black butler's uniform as the boy and had silver hair.

Her long silver hair is tied up in twin-tails with a black hair string, and her eyes are still blue and cold.

And the girl has ...... in both hands.

<blank>

Alan! Belknap!

<blank>

Colin voiced his grief.

<blank>

Alan and Belknap were grabbed by the neck and dragged away in a cruel manner. Both were unconscious.

He must have wounds all over his body, and there are long trails of blood where he was covered in blood and dragged.

<blank>

One shadow dog follows behind it.

Furthermore, its mouth.

<blank>

Damn! ...Stefan!"

<blank>

William gritted his teeth in anguish.

<blank>

Shadowdog bites his fangs into Stefan's neck and drags his body.

The reddish drool dripped endlessly from Shadowdog's mouth, probably still bleeding from where his fangs had been pierced.

<blank>

<blank>

Stefan, Alan and Belknap ...... Oh my god."

<blank>

Colin puts his hand over his mouth as he loses color, and tears begin to spill out.

Not only was the operation I had designed dancing in the hands of the enemy, but it also cost me three children.

Colin was just sobbing with remorse.

<blank>

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Hey? Hey? Regretful? Sadness? Right? How do you feel? Right?  You're frustrated, right? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! It's just the shallow wisdom of a child! It can't be helped, can it? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, too much fun!

<blank>

Oh my God!

Screw you!"

<blank>

Irving and Dana were indignant, their hands gripping their weapons, their brows furrowed in a deep crease.

<blank>

Colin. Your judgment is not wrong in this present situation. It's not your fault! It's my fault! I made the decision to bring in Stefan. I'm in charge here. I am responsible for everything!

<blank>

William put his hand on Colin's shoulder and assured him that all the responsibility was his.

<blank>

Will, Will...but I...I.........

Colin! Regret and remorse will come later! They're still going to try something!

<blank>

<blank>

A silver-haired girl tossed Alan and Belknap to their feet and licked off their blood, which was wet on her hands, with an ecstatic expression.

As if not even a drop was left behind, she sucked, licked, and sucked each finger carefully and persistently, even the ones dripping on her instep and wrist.　She sucks and licks and sucks each and every finger with great care.

<blank>

Even after he had finished licking off most of the blood on his hand, he still licked and sucked the fingers of his left hand while holding out his right hand to the boy, as if he was regretting the name...

<blank>

Give me Doug. I'll finish with Tot."

"You're going to enclose it now? Well, I rang the bell, so that's a good sign, right?"

It's not good to keep people waiting too long. But you have to have the right timing.

Which one of you is playing? It doesn't matter.

<blank>

A boy called Doug handed the girl a warding device.

<blank>

Before I knew it, the shadowdogs were quietly waiting by the boy and the girl, as if they were waiting for them.

Brutalbutt also seems to be flying around the school building, waiting for instructions to be given.

<blank>

There are 13 shadowdocs and 9 brutal bats, for a total of more than 20.

William bit his lip, saying that this was too hard a number for them to handle right now.

<blank>

"Hey, Doug. They want to know what we're going to do. Why don't you tell them?"

<blank>

The girl fiddled with the warding device, prompting the boy she called Doug to explain.

<blank>

I see. I see! It's important to tell them about the future, right? Unh!"

<blank>

Nodding his head repeatedly in amusement, the boy called Doug began to tell his story.

<blank>

Then I'll teach you! I'm gonna teach you something! Now Eliza, oh, I mean her! What Eliza is doing is modifying the wards! The wards that were in place before were designed to keep out anything hostile, right? But you know what? But this time! The strength of the wards will remain the same, but they won't let anyone in or out without our permission! In other words! You can't get out of here! Of course! Even help can't get in! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Isn't he cool?

<blank>

<blank>

"......?

<blank>

William and his friends are immensely impressed.

<blank>

I can't help but think, "This is such a convenient thing to use for enclosure! There's no way we won't use it hahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"

<blank>

And the vampire called Doug laughs heartily and happily.

<blank>

<blank>

We're in trouble! If we don't do something, there's no point in even trying to buy time until help arrives!"

Let's fortify. Bibi, surround the training ground with your rock wall. I will deploy a flame wall on the outside with maximum firepower.

No, Willie! You'll run out of magic in no time! You'll run out of healing hands! It would be more efficient if I used my Barb'd Cargo in a row!

Your magic is the cornerstone of your attack. It is not efficient to consume magic to stall the attack.

<blank>

I'm going to shoot my way out.

Dana! What are you talking about? That number! You know what I'm talking about!

I know, Colin. But it's not in my nature to be on the defensive, scared to death, waiting for the end! It's not the way for a woman of AMCAM! I'm going to go out there and deliver as many blows as I can to the enemy!

I vote for Dana! A Haggard man never backs down in the face of the enemy!"

Irving... no! No, no, no, don't!

Don't worry Bibi, I'll protect you to the end!"

No, I don't want you to do that! I don't want you to do that!"

<blank>

As the children are determined, a small rodent's eye peeks out of Beatrice's shoulder.

He talks to Kiki Kiki Kiki and Beatrice constantly.

<blank>

What? What's wrong, Algernon! What? You want me to pick you up? The boy? You know where he is? I... what? You can pick up Sue?

<blank>

Algernon's sensory perception allows him to share his senses with the small animals in the village.

Using this ability, they are able to detect a wide range of movement within the village.

Now Algernon had identified Suzy, who was about to return to the village.

<blank>

　and happily running around Beatrice.

<blank>

"Is your sister Suzy at ......?"

<blank>

Helena Slater muttered with wide eyes.

<blank>

Algernon! Can you go? Can you bring Sue?

<blank>

Everyone in the room stared at Arjanon and gulped.

<blank>

Algernon stood on his hind legs on the spot, his tail up in the air, and proudly purred a single cry.

<blank>

All of them exhaled heavily at the sight of him.

<blank>

If Sue is coming..."

Yeah, stalling works!"

The only way to win is if no one dies! You know that, right? Irving! Dana!

"I know, I know. ......, haha."

"Algernon, you'll be there soon?"

xiqiu (2-stringed Chinese musical instrument played with a bow)

Yes! Hold on a second! ≪Air walk."

I'm Magma Vital.

Air Guard from me, too."

<blank>

Algernon receives auxiliary magic from the three, and his body is strengthened.

<blank>

Algernon! Bring that girl...Sue!"

<blank>

Algernon let out a single cry and immediately ran away like a gale.

<blank>

One of the shadowdogs notices the movement and starts running toward the direction in which Algernon ran off.

One Brutal Bat also glided in to follow.

<blank>

(Please! Algernon! Please be safe!)

<blank>

Irving gently placed his hand on Beatrice's shoulder as she placed her clenched hand on her forehead and meditated.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Algernon runs. Under the hope of the children.

<blank>

I can't make Beatrice any sadder.

<blank>

That girl who always speaks harshly is a kind girl who can think of others better than anyone else.

Everyone understands the shyness of his blunt attitude.

It is her beloved personality itself.

Whenever her friends around her are hurt, her heart is filled with cutting pain and lamentation.

My heart is still choked with sadness.

Algernon knows better than anyone that his heart is deeply tender.

I know this because I am a follower who is connected to the heart.

<blank>

I can't let Beatrice grieve and suffer any longer!

<blank>

<blank>

I know where she is now.

I have an idea where they might be headed.

Therefore, I just have to run toward it as fast as I can!

<blank>

Tail up, Algernon! Faster than the wind! Hurry up and get to Suzy!



<blank>

----------------

Hurry up! Algernon!

Next "Suzy Cloud Runs!"
