# Episode 36: The Children of Amukamu - Part 1

Children's Side

Depressing developments. There are cruel depictions. Please be cautious if you are sensitive to such content.

----------------

<b>

"Is the fifth bell ringing? Is everyone here? Has Fiorina returned?"

"Not yet... she hasn't come back."

<b>

As the alarm bells echoed throughout the school, Colin checked for the presence of the children inside the room.

However, when he heard that Fiorina was still absent, Eva Avans worriedly informed Colin.

<b>

"I see... Is she a bit late? Alright! Bibi, Mia, take everyone to the training grounds. I'll go to the classroom to fetch Fiorina, please."

<b>

<b>

The fifth bell indicates a Level 3 alert.

It is the initial stage of the Amukamu beast warning.

The alarm is sounded when magical beasts invade the safe zone in the forest, indicating a risk of beast-related damage.

We must remain vigilant until the alarm is lifted.

<b>

When the alarm sounds, the children in the school are to evacuate to the training grounds, the most secure building.

In particular, the lower-tier children, who possess almost no combat abilities, must be prioritized for evacuation.

<b>

Colin entrusted the children to the two higher-tier students and ran towards the building where the classrooms were, to search for Fiorina, who should still be inside the school.

<b>

<b>

"Fiorina! Are you not here? ...That's strange, it's a straight path... Could it be that she's not in the school?"

<b>

As Colin hurriedly stepped out of the classroom to look around the school again, he glanced towards the office in the same building.

Then, he noticed something moving at the edge of his vision and turned his gaze towards it.

<b>

"...Fiorina? Are you there?"

<b>

Colin called out cautiously.

Then, from the dark corner of the office, a figure emerged slowly. It was Fiorina.

<b>

"Don't scare me like that, Fiorina! What happened? Why were you here?"

<b>

Startled by the sudden appearance of the figure, Colin held his breath for a moment.

But realizing it was Fiorina, he let out a sigh of relief.

However, something was off about her. Why was she here? Her complexion was not good. Her expression seemed somewhat vacant. She might be unwell.

<b>

"What happened? Fiorina. Are you feeling sick? Are you okay? Can you walk by yourself?"

<b>

<b>

Thinking back, the alarm had sounded when she was alone in the empty classroom.

It was no wonder she felt anxious.

<b>

"You're okay now, right? Come on, let's go back to everyone?"

<b>

Colin extended his hand towards Fiorina.

However, he suddenly noticed that she was holding something in her hand.

<b>

(Is that a hand? A child's hand?)

<b>

Fiorina was holding the hand of a younger-looking child.

As he shifted his gaze... he let out a small voice and tensed up.

In the shadow, a pale child's face was floating.

<b>

But upon closer inspection, it was clear that Fiorina was holding the hand of a boy, standing side by side with him.

<b>

<b>

"Don't scare me like that! I told you not to! Fiorina! Who is that child? Where is he from?"

"Um, he was lost outside. So I brought him inside."

"Yeah, I was let in by the big sister."

<b>

The two explained to Colin, but he couldn't quite grasp the situation.

<b>

"Uh, is he a relative of someone? Did he come to look for someone?"

<b>

In response to Colin's question, Fiorina replied ambiguously, "Something like that."

<b>

<b>

"More importantly, why are you here? We need to hurry back to everyone!"

<b>

Although Colin didn't fully understand the situation, with the alarm ringing, they couldn't stay here any longer.

He decided to take the two with him. However...

<b>

"I have something I'm looking for. It's important."

"Right, you're looking for something."

"Something you're looking for? By the way, what about Eva's basket? You don't have it, do you? Are you looking for the basket? Wasn't it in the classroom?"

<b>

Fiorina didn't have the basket she was supposed to retrieve.

Noticing this, Colin asked, but at the same time, the alarm rang out again.

<b>

"4-2?! This is bad, we need to regroup quickly! Hurry, Fiorina!"

<b>

Colin took Fiorina's hand and tried to pull her along, but she didn't move an inch.

Colin was shocked that Fiorina, who was smaller than him, was not moving.

<b>

"W-What's wrong? Fiorina! We need to go quickly! Why aren't you moving?"

"I have something I'm looking for. I need to find it."

"Yeah, you have to find it."

"What are you looking for? It's not the basket, is it? Fiorina! What on earth is going on?!"

"It's something important. I have to find it."

<b>

<b>

This wasn't getting anywhere.

Something was wrong with Fiorina's behavior.

If he looked closely, even while talking, she wasn't looking at him.

Her eyes were vacant. What had happened to her?

The child she was holding was also strange. His complexion was extremely pale.

He was wearing black clothes, but in the shadows, only his face was illuminated.

<b>

And why was it so dark here?

Even though it was shaded and the shadows were deep, it was far too dark.

<b>

It was as if... yes, it was as if they had not entered the shadows, but had stepped into darkness itself.

Colin felt a chill crawling up his spine and cold sweat trickling down.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the training grounds, the children had gathered.

Although the training grounds were supposed to be spacious, it felt densely packed with all the students present.

Amidst this, William was taking attendance and checking the number of students.

<b>

"4-2... It's been quite a while since magical beasts have come through the safe zone, hasn't it?"

<b>

Karl Jacobi was fiddling with the baton in his hand, muttering to no one in particular.

<b>

<b>

"We have the harvest festival next month, so it would be a problem if the crops were ruined!"

<b>

For some reason, Alan Edgar was huffing with his hands on his hips.

<b>

"Why do you sound so important? Alan, have you ever been that enthusiastic about the harvest festival?"

"What are you talking about, Karl! The harvest festival is a thrilling big event! If we don't get pumped up here, we won't be real men!"

<b>

"It seems like it has nothing to do with you, though?"

"I've decided to make a move this year!"

"Well, whether you make a move or get crushed, that's your own business."

"This year! I'm inviting Suzy to the harvest festival!"

<b>

At that bold declaration, several pairs of ears twitched in response.

<b>

<b>

"Hey! Don't mess with me!"

"Wait a minute, Alan. That's a careless statement."

"Huh, Alan is too thoughtless..."

<b>

Irvin, Lombard, and Bernap approached Alan. Ah, this looks like a pattern where he gets crushed before causing trouble, Karl thought as he looked up to the sky.

<b>

<b>

"Why do you all synchronize like that?!"

"Because you started saying something stupid! I won't allow that!"

<b>

Irvin pressed in on Alan while huffing. The other two nodded in agreement.

<b>

<b>

"W-What the heck! It's my own business who I invite! Besides! I don't want to hear that from someone who already has a partner to go with!!"

"W-What are you... what are you saying?"

<b>

Receiving a counterattack from Alan, Irvin suddenly looked flustered.

<b>

"Damn it! You're acting all cool! Irvin, you can just disappear!!"

"Y-You're an idiot! I haven't done anything! Besides, I haven't decided who I'm going with this year either!"

<b>

Irvin, turning bright red, flailed in denial...

<b>

<b>

"Hmm... Is that so? You haven't decided, huh?!"

<b>

Irvin jumped at the voice that came from right behind him, his spine straightening reflexively.

A chill ran down his back as if he had been splashed with cold water.

<b>

"Eh?... Bibi? W-When did you... get there?"

"Hmph! I've been here the whole time!"

<b>

Sensing the dangerous atmosphere, Lombard grabbed Alan by the scruff of his neck and pulled Bernap and Karl away from the scene.

<b>

<b>

"N-No, um, what I meant by not having decided is, well..."

"That's fine! I don't care who Irvin invites... It's his freedom! He can invite... anyone he wants, whether it's Su or Mia!!"

"No! Wait, Bibi! That's not what I meant..."

"Stop it! Don't touch me!!"

<b>

As Irvin reached out to Beatrice, she swatted his hand away and glared up at him with tearful eyes.

<b>

"…Bibi… you… so I…"

<b>

Just as Irvin was about to say something to Beatrice, the sound of the alarm bell rang out sharply from afar, causing chaos in the training grounds.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"3-2? A special alert?! Everyone, put on your gear immediately! Colin!... Colin? Where's Colin?!"

"Will, Colin hasn't come back yet."

<b>

Mia worriedly informed William.

<b>

"What?! No way! Damn it!... Willy! Dana! I'm counting on you here! Get the low-tier kids geared up! I'm going to activate the barrier device!"

<b>

<b>

The barrier device is a magical tool installed in this school.

Now that a special alert has been issued, it must be activated quickly to create a protective barrier and envelop the school.

However, the activation cannot be done by the children.

Currently, only William has the authority to activate it.

<b>

Though he was concerned about Colin not returning, activating the barrier took precedence.

Leaving the situation to the two oldest students, William dashed out of the training grounds.

<b>

<b>

The activation device was located in the office, about 30 meters south of the training grounds.

William ran while fastening the clasps of the armor he had prepared when the first bell rang.

He was already wearing his boots.

By the time he slipped on the gauntlet gloves, he had reached the office in the main school building.

<b>

<b>

William burst through the office door and jumped inside.

And immediately, he noticed that she was there.

<b>

"Colin?! What are you doing here? Is Fiorina with you?"

"Will?!"

<b>

Colin was inside the office.

In Colin's arms was Fiorina, whom she had gone to look for.

Seeing Colin carrying her, pale and bloodless, William judged that Colin had been having a hard time bringing her along.

<b>

"Both of you, hurry to where everyone is!"

<b>

While feeling relieved to see Colin, William headed towards the shelf where the barrier device was located.

<b>

"Will! No! Please be careful!!"

"Colin? I know. So you hurry and gear up in the training grounds."

<b>

William quickly instructed Colin to take a defensive stance and swiftly reached for the double doors on the upper shelf.

He performed a magical unlocking to open the door and retrieved the activation device for the protective barrier that was installed inside.

<b>

<b>

"What? It was there?"

<b>

<b>

Just after hearing an unknown voice, a mass of shadows attacked William in the form of countless spears.

The shadows destroyed the north wall of the office, and William was thrust outside with no means to resist.

<b>

"Guahh!!"

<b>

William's body was violently blown away, bouncing off the ground multiple times before finally stopping in the middle of the garden.

<b>

"NOOOOOOOOOO!!! WIIIIILLLLLL!!!!"

<b>

Colin's scream echoed through the courtyard.

Colin, still holding Fiorina, ran through the broken wall towards William.

<b>

<b>

"You know, both of these big sisters are saying they don't know where this is. It's been troubling me."

<b>

Something wrapped in black shadows, resembling a boy, emerged from the broken wall.

In his hand was the activation device William had retrieved, playing with it as if it were a toy.

His black hair was turning silver before their eyes.

Although it hadn't been clear inside, it became evident that the black clothes he wore were butler attire.

<b>

"Either way, it seems like it couldn't be taken out unless it was someone with authority, so I was saved, right?"

<b>

William pressed his hands against the ground, trying to rise.

Just then, as he exerted force on his chest muscles...

<b>

"Khah!"

<b>

He coughed and spat out blood.

<b>

(Damn! A few ribs must be broken, did I injure my lung?!)

<b>

William quickly channeled magic into his breastplate and began to chant a recovery spell.

The magical sigils on his armor responded, enhancing William's physical abilities and starting to assist in healing his wounds.

<b>

His own recovery spell and the armor's support were both minimal and elementary.

It wouldn't heal his injuries immediately.

But it was enough to move. Just then, Colin arrived.

<b>

"Will, Will! Are you okay?! Can you move?! Wait! Let me heal you...!"

"I'm fine, Colin. You take Fiorina and hurry to where everyone is."

"That's not it! Will, you're injured! Hurry! We need to treat you!!"

"This is nothing... This is nothing compared to the opponent we're facing! My injuries are nothing! Save the healing for later! You focus on supporting from the back!"

<b>

<b>

A look of anguish appeared on Colin's face.

She understood the current situation.

She couldn't expect the opponent in front of them to overlook the fact that she was consuming magic and time for healing.

If that was the case, the correct answer was to reach everyone as quickly as possible and strengthen their defenses while Will stood in the way.

That's what Will was saying.

<b>

Use me as a shield, and you run away!

<b>

She understood that.

Even knowing that, she couldn't just leave Will behind as a shield!! Colin's expression twisted in agony.

<b>

<b>

Eventually, the sound of destruction and the commotion caught the attention of the children, who began to peek out from the training grounds.

<b>

"Everyone, no! Get back!! Enemy attack!!! Get the children inside!!!"

<b>

Colin, as if making a resolution, stood up with Fiorina in her arms and ran towards the training grounds while shouting.

<b>

<b>

"I want you to leave that big sister behind."

<b>

As the boy said this, the shadows surrounding him writhed, extending sharply like spears, and thrust forward at high speed.

Several black spears passed by William, and he couldn't react.

<b>

The black spears pierced through Colin's right shoulder and left calf, pinning her to the ground.

Immediately afterward, the shadow spears vanished as if dissolving in water.

<b>

"Ugh! Aghhh!!!"

<b>

Colin's scream echoed as she was struck to the ground.

Fiorina was thrown away from Colin and landed on the ground.

Colin, bleeding from her shoulder and calf, writhed in agony on the spot.

<b>

William watched as Colin's shoulder became stained with blood, feeling his consciousness spinning.

He could barely hear the alarm bells ringing twice in the distance.

<b>

"Y-You bastard!!!"

<b>

Not only had he failed to shield Colin, but he had also allowed her to be injured right in front of him!

William turned to the boy, charging forward with anger.

<b>

The weapon in his hand was a short sword.

His usual long sword had not been brought to Amukamu this time.

This was a weapon borrowed from Howard for self-defense.

However, even if the blade was somewhat smaller, the performance of this weapon was high.

<b>

<b>

The boy grinned maliciously, sending shadows flying at William.

William dashed forward, swiftly dodging the black spears that were thrusting at him from the front, but the spears grazed and gouged his arms, legs, and unprotected cheeks.

Even so, he closed the distance to strike down with a single blow.

However, the boy swayed like a mirage and retreated.

<b>

Moreover, in the boy's hand was the arm of Fiorina, who should have moved to the back with Colin.

He was dragging her carelessly, as if she were a doll.

<b>

"W-You bastard! When did you...?!"

<b>

William gritted his teeth in anguish.

Not only had he allowed Colin to be injured, but he had also easily handed over the girl who had evacuated herself to the enemy.

<b>

<b>

"Uwaaaaaaaaaah!!!"

<b>

Suddenly, someone charged in from behind, letting out a battle cry.

<b>

<b>

"Duck, Will!!!"

<b>

Dana rushed past William, heading towards the boy.

<b>

"How dare you! How dare you hurt Colin!!!"

<b>

She thrust her spear repeatedly at the boy, but all were deflected by the black spears.

<b>

<b>

"Ugh! You...!!!"

<b>

Even so, Dana accelerated further, launching her spear.

The sound of Dana's spear striking something hard echoed like a drumbeat, resonating in the area.

Sweat dripped from Dana's focused face.

Seeing this, the boy grinned wickedly, twisting his mouth into a devilish smile.

<b>

<b>

"Stop! Dana, get down!!"

<b>

William stepped forward, batting away the black spears that were approaching Dana one after another.

However, the boy narrowed his eyes, his mouth curling up further, and the number of black spears increased dramatically.

William quickly slid in front of Dana to block the black spears, but he was overwhelmed by their numbers.

Although he avoided a fatal blow, he was still knocked back along with Dana.

<b>

"Gyahh!!"

"Ugh!"

<b>

Dana and William were sent flying backward, rolling on the ground for about four to five meters.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

William felt another impact on top of the previous injury, writhing in agony.

But he quickly tried to rise to take a defensive stance, only to see the black spears launching a follow-up attack.

<b>

(This is bad! I won't make it in time!)

<b>

If this continued, the spears would reach him before he could take a defensive position.

Taking that hit now would be disastrous! But his body couldn't keep up.

He could see Dana still unable to get up.

Both of them would be done for! Just then, a figure stood in front of him.

Immediately, the sound of metal grinding echoed.

<b>

Lombard Block stood in front of the two, raising a large tower shield to block the black spears.

Beside him, Irvin Haggard was cutting down the black spears that Lombard couldn't cover with his long sword.

<b>

"Get up! Both of you! There's no time to be lying around!!"

<b>

Irvin shouted.

<b>

"Colin is fine! The bleeding has stopped!"

<b>

William heard Willy Hodgson, who was healing Colin, shout.

<b>

"Everyone! Fall back for now! Create some distance!"

<b>

At Beatrice's command, the four began to retreat.

Colin, regaining consciousness, also backed away with Mia's support, but...

<b>

<b>

"Wait! Please wait! That child... Fiorina!!"

<b>

While leaning on Mia, Colin tried to call for a stop.

<b>

"Calm down, Colin! Right now, focus on regrouping! Otherwise... everyone will be trampled!"

"......!"

<b>

Colin fell silent at Beatrice's harsh words.

<b>

<b>

"What the hell is that thing?!"

<b>

Dana glared at the boy, voicing her doubts.

<b>

"An enemy! A type of magical beast... and a high-tier one at that!"

<b>

William replied while using recovery magic on his wounds again.

<b>

"It's a vampire. Fiorina... that child has had her blood taken by him, and she won't regain consciousness!"

<b>

Colin revealed the boy's identity with a pained expression.

Everyone widened their eyes in shock at Colin's words.

Willy muttered, "No wonder it doesn't come out of the shadows."

<b>

"What the hell is that?! Why is someone like that here?!"

"Now is not the time to worry about that!"

"I know! So what are we going to do, Will?"

<b>

<b>

"Let's call for help."

<b>

Colin, having separated from Mia, spoke up.

Mia tried to stop her, saying, "You can't walk yet," but Colin smiled back, "I'm fine, thank you," and quietly stepped away.

<b>

"That thing is something we can't deal with, and neither can you, Will. All we can do now is buy time."

<b>

Everyone fell silent at Colin's statement.

<b>

"But how? How do we call for help? The smoke bombs should have been around the area where the wall was blown away!"

<b>

Mia voiced her doubts.

<b>

<b>

"…I'll ring the bell."

<b>

Colin looked towards the bell tower standing in the school.

<b>

"I'll ring the bell to alert the village of the school's crisis. After that, we'll hunker down in the training grounds for defense!"

<b>

The walls of the training grounds were built to withstand combat training, reinforced with strong magical sigils to also serve as a shelter.

They were not the same as the ordinary walls of the school building.

<b>

<b>

"This isn't really a defensive strategy that suits me."

"You need to understand the difference in our strengths! Reckless combat isn't what a warrior does!"

"Geez! I know!"

"That's right! If you think of it as training for a defense battle, it won't be a problem!"

"This isn't training at all. It's a defense battle itself."

<b>

<b>

"So? Who's going to the bell?"

<b>

Irvin asked while looking around at everyone.

<b>

<b>

"I'll go."

<b>

Suddenly, a voice answered from behind.

<b>

"Stefan?! When did you leave the training grounds?!"

"You can't! You're not high-tier! The mid-low tier kids need to stay in the training grounds! Alan! Bernap! You two can go, right?!"

<b>

Beatrice rejected Stefan's proposal and directed Alan, a scout trainee, and Bernap, who excelled in protection, from the back.

Both Bernap and Alan responded with confident smiles, "Leave it to us!"

<b>

<b>

"I'll go! I've always been praised by Su for being the best at hiding! So I'm the best choice to go!!"

<b>

Despite Stefan's insistence, William said...

<b>

"Alright. Stefan, you go. Alan, Bernap, you will be Stefan's escort and support."

"Will?! Are you serious?! Stefan is still mid-tier!"

<b>

Beatrice protested, but William's decision remained unchanged.

<b>

"This operation is best suited for those with high speed and stealth. Stefan, Alan, Bernap. You can do it, right?"

"I can handle it alone. You two would just be a hindrance!"

"Hey! Stefan! I'm leaving you behind!!"

"Yeah, it's fine. I'll protect you two."

"The basic principle of an operation is to work in groups of three. This is the same for the protection squad. Those who can't do that can't be members."

<b>

At William's words, the three each voiced their agreement.

<b>

<b>

"Alright! What we need to do is to keep the enemy at bay while focusing on defense."

<b>

William conveyed the plan while receiving the kite shield handed to him by Mary Frank.

<b>

"Willy, Colin, Beatrice. You three will cast a distraction spell and defensive magic right at the start of the operation. After that, focus on healing. Lombard and I will act as shields here. Irvin and Dana will deal with anything we can't handle. Don't move forward for an attack! Those shadow spears will disappear in the sunlight. But their numbers are extraordinary! Don't get fixated on one and be prepared for the next! Attack from a distance, Mia, Karl will use magic, and Helena and Mary will shoot arrows!"

"But what if the arrows hit Fiorina? That child is still being held by him..."

<b>

Mary voiced her concerns while checking the bowstring of her bow.

<b>

"We don't need to hit him with our attacks. The goal is simply to distract and confuse. Aim for the black spears coming at us or drop them in front of him; that will be enough."

<b>

With that, the long-range group nodded.

<b>

<b>

Everyone listened intently to William's words, focusing on what they needed to do.

<b>

"Stefan, Alan, Bernap! As soon as we start attacking, head straight for the bell tower! Circle around the back of the training grounds to the east magic building quickly! Once you ring the bell, get out of the school as fast as you can! You need to relay this situation to the protection squad in under a second!"

<b>

The three nodded together.

<b>

"Listen, even though we're just buying time until help arrives, there's a limit. Moreover, the enemy is a vampire. Once night falls, we have no chance. Don't forget that there's a time limit! Is everyone ready?!"

<b>

"Yeah!" everyone replied.

<b>

<b>

The silver-haired boy watched them with amusement.

<b>

"Is the strategy meeting almost over? I think I've waited long enough. Can we start now?"

<b>

The shadows around the boy writhed and began to rise.

<b>

"Ugh! Here they come! Start the defensive formation!!"

<b>

William and Lombard stepped forward and readied their shields.

Behind them, Colin, Willy, and Beatrice began to chant their spells.

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. Colin Saunders, daughter of Saunders connected to Amukamu, calls upon the great guiding wind, Jilf. Protect us from those who seek to harm us with the power of that wind! <<Air Wall>>"

<b>

A wind-based defensive magic.

It creates a layer of air to reduce the enemy's attack power and distorts the atmosphere to mislead visibility and decrease accuracy.

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. Willy Hodgson, son of Hodgson connected to Amukamu, calls upon the great guiding fire, Salamander. Grant us the brilliance of life with the flame of that life! <<Life Force of Fire>>"

<b>

A fire-based support magic.

It shares the vitality of flames with those around, promoting cellular activation and enhancing physical abilities and recovery.

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. Beatrice Kuroki, daughter of Kuroki connected to Amukamu, calls upon the earth's overseer, Gnome. Create a divide between me and my enemy with the will of the rock! <<Rock Wall>>"

<b>

A ground-based defensive magic.

It creates a stone wall from the earth, forming a barrier between oneself and the enemy.

<b>

The stone walls created by Beatrice's spirit magic rose one after another, surrounding and covering the boy.

<b>

<b>

"Long-range! Begin the attack!"

<b>

Helena and Mary shot arrows while Mia and Karl began to chant their attack spells.

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. Mia Mattison, daughter of Mattison connected to Amukamu, calls upon the great earth's guide, Gnome. Strike down our enemy with the power of the earth! <<Sand Shot>>"

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. Karl Jacobi, son of Jacobi connected to Amukamu, calls upon the great guiding fire, Salamander. Burn our enemy with the power of that fire! <<Fire Shot>>"

<b>

The two who chanted the spirit magic spells opened magic circles before them.

From the magic circle opened by Mia, small stones were shot out, while from Karl's, small fireballs were launched towards the boy.

The rising dust quickly obscured the surrounding visibility.

<b>

<b>

"Now! Go!!"

<b>

At the same time, William instructed the three in the back.

Stefan, Alan, and Bernap ran behind the training grounds toward the magic building.

<b>

<b>

"They're coming! Brace yourselves!!"

<b>

Almost simultaneously with William's shout, the stone wall exploded, shattering, and countless black spears surged forward.

The wind wall offered no resistance and pierced through, approaching William and the others.

William and Lombard defended with their shields, while Irvin and Dana slashed and knocked away the spears with their weapons.

<b>

<b>

However, the countless black spears were steadily injuring the frontline.

<b>

"Ughhh!!"

"Agh! Ugh!!"

<b>

Irvin's cheek and side were grazed, and Dana's upper arm and thigh were cut and gouged.

<b>

<b>

Mia stopped the dust cloud from the stones and cast a higher-tier spell.

<b>

"Crush them! <<Rock Block>>"

<b>

Boulders the size of basketballs rained down between them and the enemy.

The black spears were obstructed, their trajectories altered, and some were crushed, reducing the number of consecutive attacks.

<b>

In the brief moment of respite, Colin and Beatrice cast healing spells on Dana and Irvin.

<b>

<b>

Then, the attack of the black spears suddenly stopped.

<b>

"How's it going? Is the plan going smoothly?"

<b>

The boy asked with a twisted smile, as if he found it amusing.

<b>

<b>

Both William and Lombard were not unscathed.

Willy was about to heal William, but he prioritized Lombard instead, saying he was fine.

<b>

Irvin and Dana had stopped bleeding, but their breathing was ragged.

<b>

(Just around 10 minutes of this exhaustion... how much longer can we hold out?)

<b>

Looking back, Colin and Beatrice also understood the severity of the situation, their expressions grim.

<b>

<b>

"By the way, I got this! There's a reason why using it would be a problem."

<b>

As the boy said this, he began to play with the barrier device he had taken.

<b>

"Someone like us can easily pass through this level of barrier. But for our subordinates, it's a bit tough."

<b>

<b>

Hearing the words of the vampire in the boy's form, William was stunned.

That barrier is no joke! It's far more robust than the magical sigils engraved in the training grounds. If they could pass through it, the walls of the training grounds would be like paper!

William's face paled at that realization.

<b>

<b>

"So, I've decided to call my children here!"

<b>

Saying this, he brought his fingers to his mouth and whistled.

<b>

"Well, since we can't use the barrier, we could have called them at any time, you know? Ahahaha!"

<b>

<b>

A shiver of discomfort ran down William's spine.

Something was coming here from all directions!

<b>

It seemed that the others sensed it too, keeping a vigilant watch around them.

The sound of many creatures kicking the ground and the presence of wind cutting through the air reached them.

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, they appeared. From the shadows of the school building, from the side of the training grounds, and from the sky, they all revealed themselves and approached.

<b>

"Everyone! Form up against the wall! Don't scatter! Frontline! Hold them off at all costs!!"

<b>

(This is bad! Shadow Dogs and Brutal Bats?! It should take 5 or 6 of these kids to handle one of them. This is too much for these kids right now!!)

<b>

<b>

Feeling a sense of urgency, William defended against the first shadow dog that charged in, thrusting his sword into it.

<b>

But the thrust was shallow. It immediately bared its fangs and lunged at him.

As he defended with his shield again, Dana thrust her spear into its side, and Irvin slammed his long sword against its neck, finally taking one down.

<b>

<b>

"Block them! <<Rock Wall>>"

<b>

Beatrice cast magic to create another stone wall.

This time, she expanded it to form a barricade around themselves and the training grounds.

The strain of casting such a wide-ranging spell made Beatrice let out a small groan as she knelt down.

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. Great earth overseer Gnome. Water Nymph. Grant strength to the children of the earth! Bind our enemies! <<Barbed Cargo>>"

<b>

Mia fused the powers of the earth and water spirits to manipulate plants.

<b>

Countless thorns burst from the ground,

wrapping around the shadow dogs' feet, robbing them of mobility and dealing damage.

<b>

<b>

"Kelm Eigo Spero Eude. With the power of that flame, pierce our enemies! <<Fire Bullet>>"

<b>

Karl shot a fireball at a bat.

The flaming bat was shot down by arrows from Mary and Helena.

<b>

<b>

"Ahahahahahaha! Keep it up! Ahahahaha!"

<b>

At that moment, the bell tower rang out vigorously, echoing its sound.

<b>

(Good! The first objective has been achieved. Now everyone should hunker down in the training grounds. The three who rang the bell should retreat outside as quickly as possible. If the enemy pursues... I'll take care of it!)

<b>

William steeled himself, furrowing his brow as he scanned the surroundings without letting his guard down.

Then, he placed his hand on the "Control Orb" shining at the center of his breastplate.

<b>

"Ahahahaha! It rang beautifully, didn't it? I wonder if it resonated throughout the entire village? Huh? Ahahahahahaha!"

<b>

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

William was stunned by the vampire's words.

What is he talking about?

That was the confusion shared by everyone who heard those words.

<b>

"What the hell is this guy?! Why does it sound like he knew the bell would ring?!"

<b>

Dana openly expressed her suspicion, revealing everyone's doubts.

<b>

"Why? Because I orchestrated it, of course! Even if you didn't ring it, we would have done it ourselves! Ahahahahaha!"

<b>

"W-Why... why would you do that?"

<b>

Colin asked, pale-faced.

<b>

"Huh? Again with the 'why?' Ahahahaha! Well, if we don't ring it, the villagers won't realize that this place is under attack. Ahahaha... If they realize too late, it would be a shame to delay dinner."

<b>

His light-hearted tone shifted dramatically at the end, concluding with a heavy tone that didn't match his appearance.

<b>

"Then hurry up and stop playing around and hand it over."

"Why? I was having a lot of fun."

<b>

Suddenly, another girl in black clothing appeared in the scene.

<b>

The girl, looking about 12 years old, was also dressed in the same black butler attire and had silver hair.

Her long silver hair was tied into twin tails with black hair ties, and her eyes were also cold and blue.

And in her hands...

<b>

"Alan! Bernap!!"

<b>

Colin cried out in a painful voice.

<b>

Alan and Bernap were being dragged along by their necks, looking utterly miserable. Both were unconscious.

They were covered in wounds, and bloodstains trailed behind them where they had been dragged.

<b>

A shadow dog followed behind them.

And even in its mouth...

<b>

"Damn it!... Stefan!"

<b>

William gritted his teeth in anguish.

<b>

A shadow dog had sunk its fangs into Stefan's neck, dragging him along.

Blood was likely still flowing from the spot where the fangs had pierced, as red drool dripped endlessly from the shadow dog's mouth.

<b>

<b>

"Stefan, Alan, Bernap... what... what have they done?"

<b>

Colin, losing her color, covered her mouth with her hand, tears streaming down her face.

Her carefully planned strategy had not only been manipulated by the enemy but had also resulted in the sacrifice of three children.

Colin was overwhelmed with self-reproach, sobbing uncontrollably.

<b>

"Ahahahahahaha! See? See? Are you upset? Sad? Huh? How do you feel? Ahahahahahaha! It's so sad, isn't it? It's frustrating, isn't it? Ahahahahahaha! After all, it's just a child's shallow wisdom! There's nothing we can do about it! Ahahaha, it's just too much fun!!!"

<b>

"That bastard!!!"

"How dare you!!!"

<b>

Irvin and Dana were furious, tightening their grips on their weapons, deep furrows forming on their brows.

<b>

"Colin. Your judgment in this situation is not wrong. You are not to blame! The one at fault is me! I was the one who decided to send Stefan in. Right now, I'm the one responsible here. All responsibility lies with me!"

<b>

William placed his hand on Colin's shoulder, declaring that all responsibility lay with him.

<b>

"Will, Will... but, but I... I..."

"Colin! Regrets and reflections can come later! Those guys are still up to something!"

<b>

<b>

The silver-haired girl threw Alan and Bernap at their feet, licking the blood from her hands with a look of ecstasy.

She licked every drop as if not leaving a single trace, even meticulously sucking on the blood that dripped from her arms and wrists. It was a chillingly seductive display.

<b>

After nearly licking all the blood off her hands, she reluctantly licked her left fingers while extending her right hand towards the boy...

<b>

"Hand over Doug. Let's finish this quickly."

"Are we going to surround them already? Well, since the bell has rung, it seems like a good time, right?"

"We shouldn't keep them waiting too long. Timing is essential, after all♪"

"Who's playing around? But it's fine."

<b>

The boy, called Doug, handed the barrier device to the girl.

<b>

Before they knew it, the shadow dogs had quietly gathered around the boy and girl, waiting for orders.

Brutal bats also flew around the school, seemingly waiting for instructions.

<b>

There were 13 shadow dogs and 9 brutal bats. More than 20 in total.

William bit his lip, realizing that this was far too overwhelming for them right now.

<b>

"Hey Doug. It seems like those kids want to know what we're going to do next. Why don't you tell them?"

<b>

As the girl fiddled with the barrier device, she prompted Doug, who she called, to explain.

<b>

"Right. That's important! I'll tell them what comes next! Okay!"

<b>

Nodding enthusiastically, Doug began to speak.

<b>

"Let me tell you! So listen closely, okay? Right now, Eliza, oh, that's her, is modifying the barrier! The previous barrier was designed to prevent anything with ill intent from entering, right? But this time! The new barrier maintains its strength, but now you can't enter or exit without our permission! In other words, everyone will be trapped here! Of course, help can't get in either! Ahahahaha! How's that? Isn't it cool?!"

<b>

<b>

"W-What?!"

<b>

William and the others were left speechless.

<b>

"With something so convenient for surrounding them, we can't not use it! Ahahahaha!"

<b>

Doug, the boy vampire, laughed heartily, genuinely enjoying himself.

<b>

<b>

"This is bad! If this continues, even buying time until help arrives will be meaningless!"

"We need to strengthen our defenses. Bibi, use your Rock Wall to surround the training grounds. I'll deploy a Flame Wall with maximum firepower on the outside."

"No, Willy! If you do that, your magic will run out in no time! We need to save healing magic!"

"My magic is essential for the attack. It's not efficient to waste magic on slowing them down."

<b>

"I'll charge out."

"Dana! What are you saying?! With those numbers! Do you understand?!"

"I know, Colin. But I can't just sit here and wait for the end while we fortify our defenses! That's not my style! It's not the way of an Amukamu woman!! I'm going to charge out and deal as much damage as I can to the enemy!"

"I vote for Dana! Haggard men never back down in front of the enemy!"

"Dana, no! Don't do it!"

"Don't worry, Bibi. I'll protect you until the end!"

"That's not what I want!"

<b>

As the children made their desperate resolutions, a small face peeked out from Beatrice's shoulder.

Algernon, the rat familiar, was chattering away at Beatrice.

<b>

"What is it? What's wrong, Algernon? You want to go get that child? You know where she is? ...Eh? You can go get Su?!!"

<b>

Algernon had the ability to share senses with small animals in the village.

Using that ability, he could sense movements across a wide area in the village.

Now, Algernon had confirmed that Suzy was trying to return to the village.

<b>

Chirping happily, he ran around Beatrice, exclaiming, "That's right!"

<b>

"Sister Suzie… is coming?"

<b>

Helena Slater murmured, her eyes wide open.

<b>

"Algernon! Can you do it?! Can you bring Sue here?!"

<b>

Everyone present held their breath, staring at Algernon.

<b>

Algernon stood up proudly on his hind legs, tail raised, and let out a single triumphant squeak.

<b>

At that sight, everyone let out a big sigh of relief.

<b>

"If Suzy is coming..."

"Yeah, buying time will be effective!"

"The victory condition is that no one dies! Do you understand?! Irvin! Dana!"

"I know... haha."

"Algernon, you can go right away, right?"

Chirp.

"Yes! Just wait a moment! <<Air Walk>>"

"Then I'll use <<Magma Vital>>."

"I'll also use <<Air Guard>>."

<b>

Algernon received the support spells from the three, enhancing his abilities.

<b>

"Algernon! Go get that child... bring Su back!!"

<b>

Algernon let out a cry and immediately dashed away like the wind.

<b>

Noticing this, one of the shadow dogs began to run in the direction Algernon had taken.

A brutal bat also glided after it.

<b>

(Please! Algernon! Come back safely!!)

<b>

Beatrice placed her hand on her forehead, closing her eyes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Algernon runs. Towards the hope of the children.

<b>

He couldn't let Beatrice suffer any more.

<b>

That girl, who always spoke harshly, was kinder than anyone else.

Everyone understood that her aloof attitude was just a cover for her shyness.

It was her beloved personality.

Every time her friends were hurt, her heart was filled with pain and sorrow.

Even now, her heart felt like it was choking with sadness.

Algernon knew better than anyone that her heart held deep kindness.

Because they were connected as familiar.

<b>

He couldn't let Beatrice suffer and grieve any longer!

<b>

<b>

Now, he knew where that girl was.

He could guess where she was headed.

So he just had to run with all his might towards that place!

<b>

Lift your tail, Algernon! Faster than the wind! Hurry to Suzy's side!!!

<b>

----------------

Hurry, Algernon!

Next time: "Suzy Cloud Charges!"
