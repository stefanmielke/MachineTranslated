# Chapter 188: The Conclusion of My First Job

In the end, it turned out that not only was the stronghold of the bandit base gone, but more than half of the mountain had also disappeared.

But, the stronghold was still somewhat intact, right?

The most crucial and important evidence should have been in the warehouse, which seemed to be quite securely and sturdily built, and it felt like it was left intact (?). 

<b>

Was it something like a shelter? I was really lucky.

I panicked quite a bit and got scolded thoroughly by Bibi, but I was greatly relieved to have obtained the crucial evidence documents.

<b>

Well, since I didn't know where the warehouse was, I managed to find it by having the lucky survivors who had miraculously escaped unscathed... this was the trio that led me to the arena!

<b>

About three-quarters of the stronghold was blown away, and the rest was just rubble. I had them point out a location that seemed like it could be around here, and after blowing away the rubble there, I finally found it.

Wow, I was really anxious!

I was sweating bullets! But I felt like I had successfully completed my mission.

<b>

It took a lot of time to sort through the documents inside.

Although, I only worked on it until the morning...

Anyway, I found the documents with Lawrence Niven's name on them and finished the task of stuffing them into boxes by the afternoon of that day.

<b>

I was later told by Bibi, who had dark circles under her eyes, that I did even more sorting work in the carriage back to Dekkenbel. What a hassle.

<b>

Goul and the bandits were mostly unharmed.

Fortunately, the magical vines from the binding spell I used seemed to have acted as a barrier and protected them.

Since most of them were buried alive, by the time I detected my magic and dug them out, they were all in critical condition! But no problem.

<b>

Even though they were lucky to survive, what awaits them now is an interrogation that is worse than death.

Whether it was truly good luck for them is another story.

Well, it doesn't really matter!

<b>

Goul is said to be taken to Dekkenbel by Mr. Roderick, so it seems he will be dragged along in a carriage, wrapped up like a caterpillar by Mia's magic.

Hmm, Mia really has no mercy.

<b>

The "horse" of this carriage is said to be a special model that Marsh designed, capable of mode changes.

When I heard that the top speed after the mode change exceeds 80 kilometers per hour for a short time, I couldn't believe my ears.

The carriage is also specially designed to withstand that speed!

What the heck is that?!

<b>

Dragged along like that, I wonder if Goul will safely reach Dekkenbel?

Since he is undead to begin with, he probably won't die.

But the image of Mia laughing maniacally while dragging Goul in the carriage sent a shiver down my spine, which is a secret.

<b>

<b>

Yes! And then there were the mother and daughter in the basement!

Laria (mother) and Viola (daughter)!

I heard from Mr. Roderick after we regrouped that these two were "shipped out" as a deterrent to him.

In other words, everyone who was in that base in the city was taken out by the human trafficking organization from Hexagum.

<b>

Mr. Roderick sent personnel to rescue them, but he doesn't know where they are now, nor when they will catch up.

I thought, "What the hell!" and activated the marker I entrusted to Viola.

Since Mr. Roderick and Goul need to urgently escort Goul to Dekkenbel, I decided to handle the rescue alone.

<b>

I quickly asked Mr. Roderick, Bibi, Mia, and Mr. Rudori to take care of Goul while I pursued the marker alone. It was already an hour after sunrise.

<b>

<b>

Their carriage was on the mountain road about 20 kilometers east of Hexagum.

It seemed they were planning to enter another country directly from Gruusmil.

The group I caught up with consisted of about ten bandits. As expected, they were all "man-eating beasts."

At first, when they realized I was the only pursuer, they laughed at me, but of course, I took them out in an instant. I sliced them up neatly.

<b>

In the end, I couldn't just leave the people who had been kidnapped there, so I had to escort them back to Hexagum.

I finally managed to regroup with Mr. Roderick's escort team after 3 PM.

<b>

After leaving the rest to the escort team, I said goodbye to Viola and the others, and by then, the sun had already dipped quite low.

<b>

Annie's birthday party had already started long ago.

I was supposed to have Bibi send a message with a pigeon about my delay, but I realized I was feeling quite a bit of damage from not being able to see Annie's shining appearance.

<b>

I wanted to run home with all my might, but I had a strong feeling that doing so would cause irreparable damage to the road!!

But I wanted to get home as soon as possible!

<b>

Then, I suddenly thought of something.

It felt like a light bulb went off!

<b>

What if I used a "magical barrier" as a stepping stone? Wouldn't that prevent damage to the ground?

If I deployed them continuously at my feet, I could step on them and go?

With the attribute "anti-physical" and the characteristic "reflection," it should hold up well enough if directed towards myself?

<b>

That was the idea I came up with at that moment.

<b>

So, I immediately tried it, and it seemed like it might work.

I just needed to rhythmically deploy barriers under my feet while running.

I thought the timing for deploying the barriers would be critical, but surprisingly, it turned out to be manageable.

<b>

I started off lightly, like I was jogging, and gradually increased my pace.

Could this actually work?!

I thought, and when I got a bit carried away and tried to speed up, I ended up breaking through a barrier with a crunch and lost my balance, rolling about 20 meters down the road, which was quite a painful memory.

<b>

Is there a problem with the durability of the barriers...? Should I increase the strength? Or should I make them softer instead? Could I make them bounce back like a trampoline?

I should consult with either Professor Seiwashi or Professor Joseline when I get back.

<b>

While thinking about that, I searched for a speed that wouldn't break the barriers and ran towards Dekkenbel alone.

Even so, I think I was going pretty fast.

In the end, I probably reached a speed of about 100 kilometers per hour?

Like a six-million-dollar man?!

<b>

There are many challenges and plenty of room for improvement.

One day, I will run faster than the speed of sound! I made a secret vow towards the setting sun!

<b>

<b>

<b>

The sunset time during this season is early. By the time I arrived in Dekkenbel, it was already completely dark.

<b>

The undead that had attacked the town that day had mostly been dealt with by then.

Uncle Philip told me that Carla and the others handled it very efficiently.

As expected of the Amukam brothers and sisters.

<b>

The process of dealing with the undead seemed to involve Dana and Lombard gathering them, which Arrows then burned. 

They apparently produced humanoid ashes one after another.

Burning is the best way to cleanly deal with undead that don't stop moving from half-hearted attacks.

<b>

Of course, since it was in the city, controlling the flames was also crucial. In that sense, Arrows was the right person for the job.

<b>

However, it was a bit scary that Arrows seemed to be in a heightened state of excitement. His eyes were a bit wild too...

<b>

Usually, when Arrows gets angry, it's when Carla does something dangerous right in front of him.

He's usually a quiet, normal person, so when he gets angry, he's genuinely frightening.

His eyes sharpen, and he snaps his fingers while scattering flames, like some kind of alchemist colonel?!

<b>

Carla seemed to be aware of this, as she wasn't making eye contact with Arrows.

...She must have done something, that sister.

<b>

It seemed that Dekkenbel had unexpectedly turned into quite a commotion, but the Amukam group had been very active!

I thought, but for some reason, Will and the other brothers and sisters who were on defense duty at the consulate looked a bit down.

<b>

Especially Arvin seemed quite depressed.

Apparently, he had fallen behind the same opponent twice.

Hmm, let's work harder. Shall we train later?

<b>

Everyone seemed quite frustrated that they had let their target escape, even though they had cornered them.

Jessica sister said with genuine regret that Victor, Colin, and Willy had plenty of strength left, so they should have been able to take them down for sure.

<b>

I see, a vampire...

Niven's eldest son, huh.

Got it, I'll turn him to dust as soon as I find him.

<b>

Well, for me, the most important thing was that I could say "Happy Birthday" to Annie on the same day!
