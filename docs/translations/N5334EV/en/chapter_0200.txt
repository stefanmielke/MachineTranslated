# 188 The End of the First Job

After all, the mountain was cleanly more than half gone, not just the remains of the fortress of the bandit stronghold.

But the fort remained somewhat intact, you know?

The warehouse, which was supposed to contain the most important and crucial evidence, seemed to have been built very tightly and sturdily, and it seemed like the whole box (?) was left behind. It seems that the entire box (?) was left behind.

<blank>

Like a shelter? We were very lucky indeed.

I was quite pale and flustered, and Bibi was very angry with me, but I was very relieved when I got the key piece of evidence, a document.

<blank>

Well, I didn't know where the warehouse was, so I let the guys who happened to be lucky enough to survive unscathed (......), these were the three guys who took me to the arena! I managed to find them by having them guide me to the warehouse. ......

<blank>

About three-quarters of the fort ruins had been blown away, and the rest was just rubble. We let them get a good idea of where we thought it might be, and finally came out after blowing away the debris.

Well, I was in a hurry!

I was in a cold sweat! But you feel like you accomplished your mission?

<blank>

It took a lot of time to sort through the documents inside.

I only do it until the wee hours of the morning, though. ......

At any rate, it was late afternoon that day when the process of finding documents with Lawrence Niven's name on them and shoving them into a packing box from one side to the other was over.

<blank>

Bibi, who had dark circles under her eyes, told me later that she had done even more mind-numbing sorting in the carriage back to Dekenbel. Nammaida.

<blank>

Gohl and his bandit crew were mostly safe.

Luckily, the ivy from the restraining magic I used seemed to act as a barrier to protect it.

Most of them were buried alive, and most of them were dying when I detected my magic and dug them out! No problem.

<blank>

Even though they were lucky to survive, what awaits them from now on is an interrogation that will be worse than death.

Whether or not these guys were really lucky is another story.

Well, it doesn't really matter!

<blank>

I heard that Mr. Roderick is going to take Gohl to Dekenber, so Mia's magic will make him into a minnow wrapped in ivy and dragged away in a carriage.

Ummm...Mia is not relentless after all.

<blank>

The "horse" of this carriage is a special prototype made by Marsh that can change modes.

I couldn't believe my ears when I heard that the maximum speed after the mode change exceeded 80 km/h for a short time.

The carriages are also specially designed to withstand the speed!

What's that?

<blank>

Will Gohl make it to Dekenberu in one piece, dragged along by such a thing?

It's undead from the start, though, so it's not like it's Chinu.

But I don't tell you that I got a little shiver down my spine when I pictured Mia dragging Gohl in the carriage with a big smile on her face.

<blank>

<blank>

Yes! And the mother and daughter in the basement!

Laria (mother) and Viola (daughter)!

I was told by Mr. Roderick after he joined us that these two were 'shipped' to Mr. Roderick as a check against him.

In short, they say that all the people who were in that city base were taken out of Hexagom by the traffickers.

<blank>

Mr. Roderick said that he had sent out personnel to rescue them, but he did not know where they were now or when they would be able to catch up with him.

You've got to be kidding me! I thought, and activated the marker plover I left with Viola.

Roderick and his team needed to get Gohl back to Dekenberu as soon as possible, so I decided to do the rescue by myself.

<blank>

I hurriedly asked Roderick, Gohl, Bibi, Mia, and Rudri to help me, and I went after the plovers on my own. It was already an hour after sunrise.

<blank>

<blank>

Their wagon was on a road in the mountains about 20 kilometers east of Hexagom.

Apparently, they were planning to enter another country directly from Grouse Mill.

The ones who caught up with us were about 10 bandits. They were all "man-eaters and man-beasts.

At first, when he found out that I was the only one pursuing him, he scoffed at me, but as a matter of course, I killed him instantly. I sliced him up into a few pieces.

<blank>

After all, we could not leave the people who had been kidnapped on the spot, so we had to return to the street toward Hexagom in the form of their escort.

It was already around 3:00 in the afternoon when we finally met up with the people from Roderick's place's convoy.

<blank>

The sun was already well into the evening when I said goodbye to Viola and her friends, who were reluctant to leave the rest of the day's activities in the hands of the convoy.

<blank>

Annie's birthday party has already started long ago.

I was supposed to have Bibi tell me that he was going to be late using pigeons, but I realized that I was pretty damaged by not being able to see Annie's sunny disposition.

<blank>

I would like to run home as fast as I can, but I can only feel the certainty that if I do so, I will cause irreparable destruction to the street!

But I want to go home as soon as possible at any cost!

<blank>

Then it occurred to me.

A beacon! and a lamp lit up?

<blank>

If you use the "magic barrier" as a springboard, the damage won't reach the ground, will it?

If they are deployed at your feet in succession, you can step on them and go, can't you?

If you point it at your side with the attribute "anti-physical" and the characteristic "reflective", it should last long enough, right?

<blank>

And that's when it occurred to me.

<blank>

I tried it out right away, and I have a feeling that it will work.

Simply repeat the process rhythmically, stretching the barriers under your feet as you run.

I wondered if the timing for deploying barriers would be severe. I thought it might be severe, but it was surprisingly manageable.

<blank>

I started with a light run, as if I was going for a run, and then gradually increased the pace.

This is going to be good looking, isn't it?

I thought, "I've got to go faster," and I stepped on a barrier, and I lost my balance and fell down the street for about 20 meters.

<blank>

Is there a problem with the durability of the barrier? ...... More strength? Or soften it? Can't it be made to bounce back like a trampoline?

I'll talk to Dr. Seiwasi or Dr. Joseline when I get back in a bit.

<blank>

With these thoughts in mind, I ran toward Dekenbel alone, searching for a speed at which the barrier would not break.

Still, I think the speed was quite high.

In the end, we were probably going 100 kilometers per hour.

Six Million Dollar Man-like?

<blank>

There are many challenges and room for improvement.

I will eventually run faster than the speed of sound! he made a secret vow to the setting sun!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The sun sets early this time of year. By the time I arrived at De Kembel, the sun had already set.

<blank>

The undead that had attacked the city that day had already been largely dealt with.

Uncle Philip told me that Carla and her team took care of it in a very efficient manner.

They are the quintessential Amcam brothers and sisters.

<blank>

It seems that the undead were being dealt with by Dana, Lombardo and the others, and then the Arrows would burn them.

I heard that they started manufacturing human-shaped charcoal extinguishers from scratch.

Burning is the best way to cleanly dispose of the undead, who don't stop moving halfway through an attack.

<blank>

Of course, because it was in the city, the ability to control the flames was also tested. In that sense, Arrows was the right person for the job.

<blank>

However, it was a little bit scary that Arrows' tension was rising. His eyes looked a bit pissed off and it was bad. ......

<blank>

It's usually quoted that when Arrows gets mad, it's when Carla does something dangerous in front of him.

Normally, he is a quiet and normal person, but when he loses his temper, he is really scary.

His eyes become sharp, he snaps his fingers and spreads flames, like some alchemist colonel! I'm like, "Is he some kind of alchemist colonel?

<blank>

I'm not sure if Carla was aware of this, but she didn't make eye contact with Arrows either.

......I bet you did something, sis.

<blank>

It looks like DeKembel unintentionally caused a lot of trouble, but the AmCam team did a great job!

I was thinking of .......

For some reason, Will and the other brothers and sisters who had been assigned to defend the consulate seemed depressed.

<blank>

Irving in particular is quite depressed.

Something about falling behind twice to the same opponent.

Hmmm, let's be diligent. Do you want to train later?

<blank>

They were all quite frustrated that we had cornered them and they got away.

Jessica said with a look of real regret that Victor, Colin, and Willie had enough energy left on their side, so they should have been able to finish them off.

<blank>

Yeah, I see, vampires. ......

Niven's eldest son.

All right, let's dust them off as soon as we find them.

<blank>

Well, for me, the most important thing was that I could say "Happy Birthday" to Annie that day!
