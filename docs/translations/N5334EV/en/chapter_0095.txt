# Episode 83: Dekember Central Coach Station

As I passed through the large northern gate, the orange-tiled roofs that immediately caught my eye seemed to stretch endlessly in my view, and I couldn't help but let out a voice of amazement.

The walls of the colorful houses were all dyed in vibrant hues, resembling the pages of a richly illustrated picture book, and just looking at them filled me with excitement.

The neatly paved cobblestone road was very wide, and the sight of many carriages and people bustling about was truly a scene of urban life.

<b>

Even Irvin, Mia, and Vivi were captivated by the scenery outside the carriage window.

Everyone! Stop staring at the city with your mouths agape like country bumpkins, or you'll be thought of as such!

<b>

"Miss... your mouth..."

<b>

...Oh no! How could I let this happen!

Even though I had been here once during the exam, I still found myself overwhelmed by the size of this city?!

And the warm gazes from Mr. Roderick and Ms. Kuu Emel directed at us felt somewhat painful...

<b>

<b>

Eventually, the carriage arrived at the central coach station of Dekember, which was bustling with activity that was incomparable to Coop Town.

There were various sizes of carriages parked there.

Some carriages were slightly swaying as people boarded and disembarked.

Others seemed to be waiting for departure, with horses quietly standing by. The drivers, likely wearing tall hats, were taking breaks, puffing on cigars or engrossed in the newspapers they held.

Over there, small carriages were neatly lined up, waiting for their turn to enter the boarding area.

Indeed, everywhere I looked, there were crowds of people coming and going, bustling about busily.

The voices of those guiding the carriages. The sound of bells announcing departure times. It was reminiscent of the hustle and bustle I had seen at stations in the world I once knew.

The number of people here was something I had never seen in Amukam.

<b>

As the carriage came to a stop, when the door was opened and I was exposed to the outside air of the city, I was suddenly hit by a sensation akin to lightheadedness.

Anna Mary, who had taken my hand as I got off the carriage, seemed to notice my momentary change and sent me a worried glance, but it was just a fleeting feeling, so I smiled back at Anna Mary to reassure her, quickly stepped down the carriage steps, and landed on the cobblestones of Dekember.

<b>

The ground I stood on was certainly different from Amukam.

I thought the same when I came here before, but the air here felt completely different.

<b>

The smell of earth and greenery that was so familiar in Amukam. The air mixed with a slightly smoky scent wafting from some stove.

The wind that caressed my cheeks carried the presence of flowers blooming in each season.

<b>

But here, the wind carried the scent of stone instead of earth.

Surely, this was the warm air warmed by the sun on the cobblestones and the closely packed houses.

On a hot summer day in Coop Town... I think it smelled similar near Ms. Cecily's shop, where the buildings were densely packed.

But it was only similar; it was entirely different.

<b>

And the scents of the people passing by. The fragrant smell of tobacco and the perfume worn by women.

The mouthwatering aroma of meat being grilled wafting from some shopfront, or the sweet smell rising when bread is baked.

<b>

Just the air that wafted around was filled with so much information.

It's no wonder I felt dizzy just stepping out of the carriage.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"This journey has been the most fulfilling and meaningful experience of my life. I cannot express my gratitude for meeting you, Miss, with a million words. Please, if you have the opportunity, come visit our trading company. You will always be welcomed."

"Miss, please feel free to come anytime, okay? If there's anything I can do to help, I will do anything for you!"

"N-no! Thank you for taking care of me during the journey!"

<b>

As we finished our farewells with Mr. Roderick and Ms. Kuu Emel, who had gotten off the carriage behind us, I felt it was a bit too much praise for us, considering how much we had relied on them during the three and a half days of travel.

Since they held my hand and spoke to me with such serious expressions, I felt a bit flustered and could only respond with a cliché reply... but still, I was truly glad that both of them had returned without injury.

<b>

<b>

"Suzie nee-samaーーーー！！"

<b>

As I finished greeting Mr. Roderick and the others, a voice calling my name echoed through the noise and crowd of the station.

Dodging through the crowd, with her sandy blonde hair flowing in the wind and sparkling blue eyes, my adorable cousin Annie, who was about to turn eight and move up a grade this year, came running straight toward me.

<b>

"Annie?! It's been a while! Did you come to see me?!"

<b>

Annie dashed straight toward me, and I lowered myself a bit to match her height. I caught her beautifully in mid-air and spun around while holding her in my arms.

We then rubbed our cheeks together, sharing the joy of our reunion.

Annie seemed to be ticklish and giggled while shrugging her shoulders.

That gesture was just too cute!

<b>

Huh? Now that I think about it, I feel like I recently had a similar experience of being jumped on and hugged by a little girl?

Well, the younger kids at school often come running to hug me too!

For me, cute kids are always welcome. Cute is justice!!

<b>

Annie, who adores her older brother Will, who is more than ten years older than her, has sandy blonde hair and very beautiful blue eyes, though her hair is a bit browner than her brother's.

She has grown fond of me as her new older sister and becomes a clingy little bug every time she comes to Amukam.

<b>

"We're quite late from the expected arrival time, but I'm glad everyone is safe and sound."

"Thank you for your hard work, Suzie. The news has reached us. Thank you all for your efforts."

"I'm sorry for making you come all the way to greet us, Uncle Philip. Aunt Liliana."

"Don't worry about it, Suzie. How could we not come to greet our lovely niece?"

"That's right. Now, let me hug my adorable niece quickly?"

<b>

Following Annie, a little later came Uncle Philip, who is Howard Papa's brother living in Dekember, and his wife, Aunt Liliana.

In other words, they are Will and Annie's parents! They are my uncle and aunt.

Uncle and Aunt come to Amukam every year for the harvest festival. They are very kind and always treat me well whenever I meet them.

<b>

Uncle Philip is a slightly shorter version of Howard Papa, with gentle and kind eyes.

Aunt Liliana is a very elegant lady with a slender figure. The hair of Will and his siblings must have come from their aunt.

<b>

"Welcome, Su, Vivi, Mia, Irvin, Ron. It must have been a long journey, are you all tired?"

<b>

After greeting Aunt Liliana, another voice came from behind her, where another family member stood.

<b>

"Thank you, Colin. As you can see, everyone is well. Thank you for coming to greet us!"

"It's nothing. It's for the lovely Su and the others!"

<b>

With a smile as if it were only natural, Colin, who was wearing the same uniform as us, stood there.

Colin was wearing the same uniform as us, but her skirt was evergreen, and her ribbon tie was also the same evergreen color.

At Milia Castle Eye Boarding School, the uniforms change color depending on the grade.

<b>

"Colin nee-sama has been looking forward to your arrival, Suzie nee-sama?!"

<b>

Annie, having left my side, ran over to Colin and hugged her while saying that.

They then looked at each other and laughed together.

...Hmm, I knew that Annie seemed to get along well with Colin every time she came to Amukam, but... did Colin come here and their friendship deepen even more?

<b>

At the coach station, our luggage was starting to be unloaded, so I quickly went to receive it and transferred it to the Cloud family's carriage that Uncle had arrived in.

<b>

This coach station has both streetcarriages and shared carriages going to the boarding school, but Uncle prepared his own carriage just to take us to school.

<b>

Once we enter the dormitory, we won't be able to go outside without permission. So we won't be able to see each other as often. Since it's a special occasion, he wanted to greet us and let us see his face.

It seems that Howard Papa and Uncle offered this to us. I am truly grateful for this.

<b>

Irvin and Ron were also helping with the unloading. Hmm, Irvin is properly carrying Vivi's luggage to Uncle's carriage by himself.

Yes, he is indeed practicing lady first! Yes, yes! Make sure to stay close to Vivi like that! So that you don't activate any lucky pervert incidents toward me!!!

The lucky pervert incidents of the Haggard family don't discriminate by time, place, or person, so there's really no way to deal with it! Please stay close to Vivi as much as possible to avoid directing any attention toward me! Seriously!!

<b>

While the unloading was finishing up, Uncle Philip seemed to be exchanging a word or two with Mr. Roderick. I wonder if they know each other?

I hadn't heard anything about that during the carriage journey... but well, since they both live in Dekember, it wouldn't be strange if they were acquaintances.

<b>

Once most of the luggage had been transferred, I said my farewells to Mr. Roderick again and headed toward Uncle's carriage.

Then Annie slipped between Colin and me, holding our hands while beaming with a smile that seemed about to spill over.

<b>

"I'm so happy to be with my big sisters!!"

<b>

Annie held both my and Colin's hands, sandwiched between us, and radiated a very happy smile.

Of course, I was happy too!

But still, Annie's attachment to Colin is something else...

<b>

"W-what is it, Su..."

"...It's nothing, Colin nee-sama."

"...! W-wait, wait, wait!!"

<b>

Colin's face was turning red before my eyes.

It's rare to see Colin flustered like this.

When I couldn't help but burst out laughing, Colin's face turned even redder.

Annie looked up at us with a puzzled expression.

I smiled at Annie, assuring her that it was nothing, and we boarded the Cloud family's carriage that Uncle had prepared for us.

"How was it, Kuu Emel?"

"They were honest and good kids. All of them are promising for the future."

"Indeed. I wonder how beautiful that 'princess' will become in the future... I truly look forward to seeing her grow."

"But it seems that she is not very aware of how much attention she attracts. Despite stealing the gaze of so many wherever she goes... Even those ruffians seemed to hold their breath when she appeared from the carriage, yet she didn't notice at all. However, she seems to be quite curious and tries to poke her nose into everything... I wonder if those around her are quite anxious about it?"

"Haha, that's true! That maid seemed to be quite busy shooing away the many insects (men) trying to gather around her in the towns."

"Their parents must be quite worried as well. I can only imagine their feelings."

<b>

"Speaking of ruffians... They truly are the people of Amukam. Even though they are just children, they managed to subdue that many in no time! I am truly impressed."

"Yes. Honestly, I didn't expect them to be that capable. The chairman must have thought so too, which is why he rushed to put out the fire, right?"

"Well, yes, that's true. But in the end, I ended up being a hindrance. I feel ashamed."

"That's not true, Chairman. I'm just glad you weren't hurt. I apologize for not being of more help."

"No, no, that's not true, Kuu Emel. In fact, I believe you could have handled them all by yourself. If it weren't for that Arvin boy getting in your way, you might have taken them down yourself, right?"

"...Is that so? There were quite a few of them after all... Besides, I think it was the right decision to have him stop me."

<b>

"Oh? What do you mean by that?"

"...At that time, when I was trying to approach for a surprise attack, the man behind the leader noticed me and reacted. He seemed to panic and was about to throw something at me, but because I was stopped by him, he seemed to have hesitated."

"...I see."

"In the end, that guy was taken down first by him, so it all worked out... But after that, I became curious about what he had, and when I searched through his belongings, I found something..."

"Did something troublesome come out?"

"...I don't know. I couldn't tell what it was. It looked like a small egg, shining faintly silver. I suspect it might be some kind of magical tool. However..."

"But...?"

"...When I tried to probe into it a little by channeling some magic into it, I felt a chill run through my entire body. That thing is undoubtedly an incredibly dreadful item. It's not something a person should handle."

"Is it something that warrants such caution... What kind of thing is it that a mere band of robbers possesses?"

"I have no idea. But I made sure to ask Palus to handle it with strict sealing techniques and entrusted it to them."

"Hmm, if that's the case, we can rest easy for now. If it's something beyond our control, it's best to leave it to the authorities. Eventually, the route of acquisition for such a dangerous item will become clear."

"...Indeed. I never want to touch something like that again. I can't thank him enough for stopping me."

<b>

"However, hearing such stories only makes me more aware of their strength!"

"Yes... To be honest, I feel like the level of strength between me and those kids is two or three dimensions apart."

"Is it really that much?!"

"As for that young lady... I can't even imagine how far apart we are. The movement she displayed when she took down the leader... I couldn't even sense her presence."

"That's impressive... So those kids are that powerful?"

"Yes... They are said to be the 'Golden Generation.'"

"I see. The Consul General Cloud told me to 'take care of them,' but it seems we will be the ones receiving their care."

"Absolutely. The young ladies will be visiting our branch soon. I'm looking forward to it already."

"Alright! Then let's hurry back to the trading company. We might have information from Palus as well. Let's wrap up any troublesome matters quickly!"

"Chairman, if you always worked like that, I wouldn't have to be here as your supervisor..."

".................."

"Sigh... Please, okay?"
