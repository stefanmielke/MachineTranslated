# 83 Episode 83 De Kembel Central Carriage Station

As soon as I passed through the large north gate, I saw the orange tiled roof that filled my entire field of vision and went on forever, and I couldn't help but let my voice escape from my mouth.

The walls of the colorful houses are all so colorfully dyed that it is like opening the pages of a colorful picture book, exciting to behold.

The neatly laid stone-paved streets are very wide, and the many horse-drawn carriages and people coming and going on them are a true urban scene.

<blank>

Even Irving, Mia, and Bibi are enthralled by the scenery outside the car window.

Everyone! Stop staring at the city with your mouths hanging open like that. People will think you are countrymen.

<blank>

"Miss ...... your mouth."

<blank>

...... Huh! What did I do?

I had already been here once for an exam, but I was still overwhelmed by the size of this city, you say?

And the warm and friendly looks from Roderick and Cu Emel that they are pouring on us are painful to me. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Eventually, the carriages arrived at the central carriage depot in De Kembel, which was also much busier than Copetown.

Carriages of all sizes were parked there.

One of the carriages was shaking slightly as people were getting in and out of it, making the body of the carriage sink.

In one of the carriages, horses were waiting quietly, as if they were waiting for departure. Men in caps, who appeared to be the officials, were resting under the officials' seats, puffing on cigars, reading newspapers in their hands, and taking other breaks as they pleased.

On the other side of the road, there is a neat line of small carriages, perhaps tawny carriages waiting for their turn to enter the boarding area, all lined up side by side.

After all, everywhere I looked, there were many people coming and going and moving busily.

The sound of someone guiding a carriage. The sound of bells signaling departure time. It reminded me of the hustle and bustle of the train station in my old world.

First of all, it's the number of people you never see at Amcam.

<blank>

When the carriage doors were opened and I was exposed to the open air of the city, I felt a slight sensation of vertigo.

AnnaMarie, who had been holding my hand as I got out of the carriage, noticed my momentary change and gave me a concerned look, but the feeling was only temporary, so I smiled back at AnnaMarie and assured her that I was fine, and immediately stepped onto the carriage steps and went on my way. We landed on the cobblestones of De Kembel.

<blank>

The land where I put my feet on the ground is certainly a different land from Amkam.

I thought so when I came here before, but the air here is so different.

<blank>

The smell of earth, grass, and trees that was a natural part of Amkam. The air is laced with a slightly smoky aroma that comes from some cooking stove.

The wind that caressed my cheeks at any time carried the presence of seasonal flowers and grasses.

<blank>

But the wind in Coco carries the smell of stone, not earth.

This must be the air warmed by the sunlight from the paved cobblestones and the densely packed houses.

On a hot midsummer day, on a back street in Copetown ......, near Cecily's store, where the buildings are clustered, I think it smelled similar to this.

But they are very different, just similar.

<blank>

And the smell of people passing by. The smell of fragrant cigarettes and the scent of perfume worn by women.

The mouth-watering smells wafting from some storefront, like meat being grilled, or the sweet smell of baking bread.

<blank>

The air in the air alone is just so much information.

I don't think it can be helped if you just get out of the carriage and come back to Clari.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

This trip has been one of the most fulfilling and meaningful in my life. A million words cannot express how grateful I am to have met your daughter. Please, if you ever have the opportunity, come to our business. You are always welcome."

"Miss, you really are welcome to visit us anytime, aren't you? If there's anything I can do for you, anything at all?"

No, no! Thank you for everything you did for me during my trip!"

<blank>

Roderick and Cu Emer, who got off the carriage after us, politely said goodbye to us.

It's a shame to say that we were indebted to you during the three and a half days of our trip.

I was in such a hurry that I could only give a clich√©d response. ......, but even so, I am very glad that they were not injured in the end.

<blank>

<blank>

Sister Suzy, oh my gosh!"

<blank>

As I was greeting Roderick and the others, I heard a voice calling my name from among the hustle and bustle of the stop and the waves of people.

Running straight toward us, with her back-length sandy blonde hair swaying in the wind and a twinkle in her blue eyes, is my sweet cousin Annie, who will soon celebrate her 8th birthday and is moving up to the second grade this year.

<blank>

Annie? Long time no see! You came? !"

<blank>

Annie jumped in a straight line toward me, who was a little shorter to match her height. I caught it beautifully in mid-air and spun around in my arms.

As it was, we rubbed cheek to cheek and expressed our joy at seeing each other again.

Annie is ticklish, giggling and cowering her head to show it.

The gesture is also really cute!

<blank>

Huh? Come to think of it, I feel like I've been jumped on and hugged by a little girl like this just recently, haven't I?

Well, the younger kids at school also come to me for a hug as soon as things happen!

In my opinion, pretty girls are always welcome. Cute is justice, right?

<blank>

Annie is a big brother child who loves Will, who is more than 10 years older than her, and has sandy blonde hair much like Will's, and very beautiful blue eyes. But her hair is a little more brownish than her brother's.

She misses me as she has a new big sister, and she is a cute little girl who becomes a snuggler every time she comes to Amcam.

<blank>

We're long overdue for an arrival, but I'm glad everyone's OK."

Thanks for your help, Susie. The news has arrived. Thank you all for your hard work."

I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here to see me. Uncle Philip. Aunt Liliana.

I said, "Don't worry about it, Susie. Our lovely niece is coming and there's no reason why you can't pick her up."

Yes, I do. Now, let me quickly embrace my adorable niece?"

<blank>

Coming in a little later after Annie were Phillip and his wife, Liliana, who are brothers of Papa Howard, who live in DeKembel.

In other words, Will and Annie's parents! To me, they are my uncles and aunts.

My uncles always come to AMCAM every year during the harvest festival. They are very kind aunts and uncles who treat me well every time I see them.

<blank>

Uncle Philip looks a little like a slightly smaller version of Papa Howard, with a very calm and gentle look in his eyes.

Aunt Liliana is a very nice lady with a slender style. Will and his siblings must have inherited their hair from their aunt.

<blank>

Welcome, Sue, Bibi, Mia, Irving, and Ron. You must have had a long trip. Aren't you tired?"

<blank>

After greeting Aunt Liliana, I was approached by another person who was standing behind her as if she were a member of the family.

<blank>

Thank you Colin. As you can see, everyone is fine. And Colin, thanks for going out of your way to pick me up, too, huh?"

It's okay. It's for my sweet Sue and the kids!"

<blank>

Colin, wearing the same uniform as us, was standing there with a smile on his face as if to say, "Of course.

Colin wears the same uniform as we do, but his skirt is evergreen and his ribbon tie is the same evergreen color.

At the Milia Castellai boarding school, the uniforms are different colors for each grade level.

<blank>

Colin, you know how much she's been looking forward to having you and Susie here!"

<blank>

Annie said as she left my side and ran to Colin and hugged him.

As it is, he and Colin are staring at each other and laughing together.

......Hmmm, I knew from watching Annie that every time she came to Amcam, she and Colin seemed to get along well when they met. ...... I wonder if Colin's visit to Koch further increased the degree of their friendship?

<blank>

At the stagecoach, our luggage was being unloaded, so we went to pick it up immediately and had it transferred to the Cloud family's carriage in which my uncles were riding.

<blank>

There are horse-drawn wagons at this station, and there are also passenger carriages that go to the front of the boarding school, but my uncle made it a point to provide his own carriage to take us to the school.

<blank>

Once you are in the dormitory, you are not allowed to go outside unless you have permission to go out. Therefore, you can't always see them. I would like you to welcome me and let me see my face.

He said that his uncle offered to Howard Papa. I really appreciate this story.

<blank>

Both Irving and Ron are helping to unload. Irving is also carrying Bibi's luggage to his uncle's carriage by himself.

Yeah, you're really putting the ladies first! Mm-hmm! That's right! You should stay on Bibi's ass like that! Mainly so she doesn't trigger her lucky skate on me!

The Haggard family's lucky skating is so unpredictable that there is really no way to deal with it! Please stick with Bibi as much as possible and don't point the finger at us! Seriously!

<blank>

While we were unloading, Uncle Philip seemed to be exchanging a word or two with Mr. Roderick. I wondered if they knew each other.

I didn't ask that during the carriage trip, but ......, well, we both live in Dekenbel, so is it any wonder that we know each other?

<blank>

When we had roughly finished transshipping our luggage, we said goodbye to Roderick again and headed for his uncle's carriage.

Then Annie slipped in between me and Colin, holding our hands and smiling at us.

<blank>

I'm so happy to be with my sisters!"

<blank>

Annie had her hands clasped between mine and Colin's, and was wearing a very happy smile.

I'm happy, too, of course.

By the way, Annie's nostalgia for Colin is amazing. ......

<blank>

Hey, what?" Sue ......"

"It's ...... nothing, ...... sister Colin."

"......! Nah, nah!"

<blank>

Colin's face turns red as he watches.

It's rare to see a waddling colin.

When he blurts it out, Colin's face turns even redder.

Annie looked up at us curiously.

I smiled at Annie and said, "It's nothing," and we got into the Cloud family carriage that my uncle had prepared for us.

<blank>

How was it, Cu Emel?"

They were good, honest children. They are all looking forward to the future.

I agree. I wonder how beautiful she will become in the future. ...... Indeed, I am looking forward to seeing her in the future.

But he doesn't seem to have much awareness of how much he is attracting attention. He was so much in the limelight everywhere he went. ...... Even those outlaws were gasping for breath when he emerged from his carriage, but he didn't notice them at all. He was so curious himself that he tried to stick his face in everywhere. ...... People around him must be very irritated.

"Ha, indeed! That maid of honor seems to have been paying off a lot of insects (men) who were trying to gather around the town.

I'm sure your parents are not too happy about it. I can only imagine what they are going through.

<blank>

Speaking of "outlaws," you can find them at ....... They are the people of Amkam, aren't they? They are just children, and yet they were able to conquer that many people in no time at all! I am amazed.

I don't think so. To be honest, I didn't think it was that bad. The chairman must have thought so, too, and that's why he bought his way into the firefighting business."

No, ha, I know. I've ended up being a liability, haven't I? I'm sorry."

I don't think so, Mr. Chairman. I am glad you are not hurt. I am also sorry that I could not help you.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's not true, Cu Emel. In fact, I'm wondering if you could have managed them on your own? If he, Mr. Irving, had not prevented you, you would have beaten them, wouldn't you?"

I don't know about that."...... It was that many people in quicksand and ....... Besides, I think I did the right thing in getting him to stop."

<blank>

"Oh? What does that mean?"

When I approached ...... that time to force my way in. The guy behind that leader figure noticed me and reacted. He was about to throw something at me as quickly as he could, as if in a panic, but he seemed to have stopped for the moment when he saw that I had stopped him."

"...... method."

He ended up being the first one to kill the guy, so he got away with it. ...... After that, I was curious what the guy had on him, so I went through his belongings and found what I found: ......"

Did something nasty come up?"

I don't know "....... I could not tell what that thing was. It looked like a small egg, thin and shiny silver. I think it was probably some kind of magical tool. But ......"

Yes?"

When I put a little bit of magic power into it to explore the ...... inside, my whole body was furious. ......That thing is definitely a tremendously fearless object. It is not something that should be handled by humans."

"Is it such a ...... thing that you're that alarmed about it? Why would ...... such a thing be in the possession of one group of robbers?"

I don't know. But it is a palouse, and I have asked the head of the Guard to handle it with the strictest of sealing techniques.

Well, that's a relief for the time being, isn't it? If it is something that is beyond our control, it is definitely best to entrust it to a public institution. Eventually, we will be able to discover the route of acquisition of such a dangerous item.

"...... really. I don't ever want to touch that thing again. I can't thank him enough for stopping me."

<blank>

But hearing such stories makes me see more and more how good they are at what they do!

I know. ....... To be honest, I feel as if I and those girls have two or three different dimensions of strength.

Is that all there is to it?

"When it comes to that young lady,......, I can't even imagine how different she is anymore. That movement ...... when she slaughtered the man who was the leader. I couldn't even catch a glimpse of the young lady."

'That's great ....... You mean those kids are that good?"

Yes, ......, because I hear they're called the 'Golden Generation.'"

'I see. Consul General Cloud told me, 'Please take good care of me. ....... It looks like it's going to be us who will be taking care of you."

I'm sure you'll be able to find us soon. I'm sure the ladies will be visiting our branch soon. I'm looking forward to it.

Good! Then let's hurry back to the Chamber of Commerce, shall we? We may have received some information from Palouse. Let's get this mess over with!

I'm sure you'll be very pleased with the way I've been working with you. If you would always go about your business like that, I wouldn't have to be your chaperone. ......

".................."

"Huh. ....... Please?"
