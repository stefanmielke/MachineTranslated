# 206 Irving Haggard Strikes Hard!

In the forest at night, a continuous metallic sound echoes through the trees.

The blade of the two-handed sword, which is approaching with a sound that cuts through the wind, is deflected by a dagger-like black claw that echoes with a high-pitched sound.

<blank>

The blade of the two-handed sword was faintly clothed in a holy air, and several streaks of light were drawn around the area.

As if wary of its sanctimonious blade, the black dagger-like claw deals with it without care.

<blank>

"What's up?　You're pussyfooting around, aren't you?"

Nonsense!"

<blank>

Van, who raised his eyebrows abhorrently, grabbed the blade of the two-handed sword that was swung down the next moment with his left hand.

Van's left hand grabs the blade that is clothed in holy chi, and a white smoke rises from it.

<blank>

What the hell?

The lightweight sword is not worthy of our attention!"

<blank>

Van pulls the sword blade down forcefully outward with his gripped left hand. Irving's body opens outward with his grip on the two-handed sword.

Van thrust his sharp black claws into his chest with a force that split the atmosphere.

<blank>

!!!"

<blank>

Quickly, Irvin folded his left arm and took up guard to keep his chest down.

The magic mark on the equipment glows for a moment.

<blank>

The black claw was thrust with a force that could have gouged a rock, but it was unable to penetrate the guard and was played.

But Irving's left arm and sternum creak.

<blank>

Gooo ......!"

It's depressing!"

<blank>

Van immediately fires a kick to Irving's chest.

<blank>

Gah!

<blank>

Undeterred, Irving is flung backward.

Van steps forward to further drive home the point.

<blank>

But a shadow falls directly above it.

Lombard emerged from the mass of fog that still lingered around the area.

<blank>

"Rock Drop."

Lombardo's battleaxe looms over Van's head, scattering compressed magical light.

<blank>

Van quickly crossed his arms over his head to take guard, but the impact made his feet sink to the ground and both arms were shattered.

<blank>

Goh!　O-ore-i!"

Nooooo!

<blank>

Van, however, swung his shattered left arm around without a care, sending Lombardo's body flying violently.

His shattered arm was quickly repaired. However, white smoke was still rising from the palm of his left hand, which had been burned by the holy spirit.

<blank>

Is this one specially made?"

<blank>

Immediately thereafter, Mia's two outstretched fingertips touched Van's right breast.

What was produced there was a "grenade" that was one size larger than the previous one.

It shoots out at zero distance.

At the same time, Mia uses "Air Ride" for her feet.

Instantly, a flash of light envelops Van's upper body and a vicious explosion shakes the atmosphere.

Mia, pushed away by the blast she created, protects herself with both arms while deploying her shield, and retreats backward at high speed.

<blank>

<blank>

The explosion ripped the upper half of Van's body wide open.

His right arm is nearly shredded and barely hanging on at the shoulder joint.

The right half of his face is also blown off, and the right side of his chest is gouged wide open, with a slight peek of his beating heart.

After taking this much damage, he loses his footing and shakes his upper body on the spot.

However, even with such extensive damage, the flesh bubbles up as if bubbling, and the wounds are repaired as one watches.

<blank>

<blank>

Mia, on the other hand, had moved several dozen meters backward in this instant.

There is Irving, with the tip of his sword on the ground and a two-handed sword at his side.

<blank>

Irving sits back and takes a stance.

As you exhale thinly and quietly, concentrating deeply and profoundly, the magical markings on your equipment glow.

Irving's dark blonde hair sways and his eyes take on a faint golden tinge.

The two-handed sword in his hand is also dense with golden holy qi.

<blank>

Mia touched Irving's two-handed sword as they passed each other, activating the magic.

<blank>

Mass Increase

<blank>

The two-handed sword, with its increased weight, sinks into Irving's shoulders as he supports it.

<blank>

<blank>

The weight of this sword is not the same as the heavier blade-pulled sword that I usually use in training. It is definitely one order of magnitude heavier.

One of the maces used by Bert's brother was about this size, as I recall. If he swung it badly, it would do something to his shoulder.

But this is fine!

<blank>

Bibi and his team have prepared the path in front of us. All that remains is to use our skills in a straight line toward our goal!

As was the case with the last one, he gains strength every time he recovers from a major injury.

If we don't get this over with, there probably won't be much left to do.

I'll make a definite decision on this!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Van, who was repairing his body, caught an unusual presence and turned his eyes sharply in that direction.

The fog has not yet dissipated. But I can sense that there is something out there.

Suddenly, the fog lingering at my feet is swept away by the wind and the surface of the earth peeks out.

There was a stretch of road there that looked like it was paved.

<blank>

<blank>

It was not there earlier.

Is this 'bedrock road'? Did it develop out of the fog?

I found myself stuck to my feet, unable to move.

They do a clever little imitation!

But the repair of the body will also be finished immediately.

As soon as they recover, they will get out of this and all of them will be overrun this time!

<blank>

<blank>

Assault Dash."

<blank>

Through the fog, he suddenly appeared.

The whole body is clothed in a disastrous holy air, more dense than ever before.

This guy! Don't tell me you were backingwards to knead this?

He's moving ever so unusually fast!

<blank>

Power Smash."

The tip of the sword arcs right across at ultra-high speed.

The tip of a sword, coated in holy chi, looms in front of you.

Quickly, he put his right arm, which had been repaired, around the guard, but at that moment the blade bit into that arm.

<blank>

But his power will not cut off my arm! I have proven it time and again!

When the sword muscle stops, this time it will pierce its chest!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Power Smash" is a basic strong-hitting skill that Irving first learned from Suzy.

<blank>

The two-handed sword, greatly increased in weight by "Mass Increase," is moved at high speed by "Assault Dash" and struck with the powerful striking force of "Power Smash.

It is a mass weapon too heinous to be used by human hands.

<blank>

Its use also places an excessive burden on the user's body, which has been strengthened with magical equipment.

But the blow has the power to cut through even the strongest gravisteel alloy armor like paper.

<blank>

Van raised his right arm to guard, and contrary to his expectations, it was easily cut off like clay.

As it is, it cuts through the thick breastplate and carries the blade to its weak point.

<blank>

The moment Irving sensed that the blade of the two-handed sword had reached there, he poured in as much holy chi as he could muster.

<blank>

"ohohohoh -------- --！！！！！"

<blank>

With a yell from the depths of his belly, a torrent of golden holy qi sears the immortal's body from the inside out.

<blank>

Goboo!"

<blank>

Golden holiness rises as a flame and blasts from the eyes and from the mouth.

When Irving drew his two-handed sword, his body dropped to his knees as if he had lost all strength, and he fell to the ground with a thud.

The right arm that was cut off does not appear to regenerate.

<blank>

When Irving confirmed this, he sunk the tip of his two-handed sword into the earth and exhaled heavily, relaxing his shoulders.
