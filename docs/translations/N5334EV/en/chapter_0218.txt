# Chapter 206: Arvin Haggard's Fierce Assault!

In the night forest, a series of metallic sounds echoed between the trees.

With the sound of slicing through the wind, the blade of the two-handed sword approached, deflected by black claws that resonated with a high-pitched sound like a dagger.

<b>

The blade of the two-handed sword was faintly wrapped in holy energy, drawing multiple trails of light around it.

As if to be wary of that holy energy-laden blade, the black dagger-like claws deftly handled the blade without any carelessness.

<b>

"What's wrong? Are you backing down?"

"Don't be ridiculous!!"

<b>

With a scowl, Van furrowed his brows and, in the next moment, caught the descending blade of the two-handed sword with his left hand.

Van's left hand, gripping the blade wrapped in holy energy, emitted a hissing sound as white smoke rose.

<b>

"This?!"

"From the start, such a light sword technique isn't worth being cautious about!"

<b>

Van forcefully pulled the blade outward with his gripping left hand. Arvin's body opened up as he held onto the two-handed sword.

Van sharply extended his black claws toward Arvin's chest, thrusting with the force that split the air.

<b>

"!!"

<b>

In a split second, Arvin folded his left arm and took a guard position to protect his chest.

The magical seal on his equipment briefly shone with light.

<b>

Though the black claws thrust in with the power to gouge rock, they could not penetrate the guard and were deflected.

However, Arvin's left arm and sternum creaked under the pressure.

<b>

"Ugh...!"

"Annoying!"

<b>

Without hesitation, Van delivered a kick to Arvin's chest.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

Unable to bear it, Arvin was sent flying backward.

To deliver a follow-up attack, Van stepped forward.

<b>

But a shadow fell directly above him.

From the remaining mist in the area, Lombart appeared.

<b>

『Rock Drop』

Lombart's battle axe approached above Van's head, scattering the light of compressed magical power.

<b>

Van instinctively crossed his arms above his head to guard, but the impact sank his feet into the ground, shattering both arms.

<b>

"Ugh! You bastard!!"

"Ugh!!"

<b>

However, Van disregarded his shattered left arm and swung it around, violently striking Lombart's body away.

The shattered arm began to repair itself before one's eyes. However, white smoke still rose from the palm of his left hand, burned by holy energy.

<b>

"Is this one a special edition?"

<b>

Immediately after, Mia's two extended fingertips touched Van's right chest.

What was created there was a significantly larger "grenade" than the previous one.

It was fired at zero distance.

At the same time, Mia used "Air Ride" at her feet.

In an instant, a flash of light enveloped Van's upper body, and a vicious explosion shook the air.

Mia, as if being blown away by the blast she created, deployed a shield and protected herself with both arms, retreating rapidly backward.

<b>

<b>

The explosion tore Van's upper body apart.

His right arm was nearly severed, barely hanging by the shoulder joint.

The right half of his face was blown off, and the right side of his chest was deeply gouged, revealing a beating heart.

With such significant damage, he became unsteady on his feet, swaying in place.

However, even after sustaining such severe injuries, his flesh swelled and healed rapidly.

<b>

<b>

Meanwhile, Mia had moved several dozen meters back in that brief moment.

There stood Arvin, with the tip of his sword touching the ground, holding the two-handed sword at his side.

<b>

Arvin lowered his stance and took a position.

Exhaling quietly and deeply concentrating, the magical seal on his equipment emitted light.

Arvin's dark blonde hair swayed, and his eyes took on a faint golden hue.

And the two-handed sword he held also gathered dense golden holy energy.

<b>

As Mia passed by, she touched the two-handed sword that Arvin was holding, activating the magic.

<b>

『Mass Increase』

<b>

The two-handed sword, now increased in weight, caused Arvin's shoulders to sink heavily.

<b>

<b>

This weight was not comparable to the heavier practice sword he usually trained with. The weight was definitely one whole level higher.

One side of the mace that Bart used was about this much. If swung carelessly, his shoulder might be in trouble.

But this is good!

<b>

The path before him was prepared by Bibi and the others. All that was left was to use his skills in a straight line toward the target!

It was the same last time, but he grew stronger every time he recovered from significant damage.

If he didn't finish this here, there might not be another chance.

He would make sure to end it with this!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As Van repaired his body, he sensed an unusual presence and sharply turned his gaze toward it.

The mist had not completely dissipated yet. However, he could sense something beyond it.

Suddenly, the mist at his feet was blown away by the wind, revealing the ground.

There lay a paved road extending ahead.

<b>

<b>

It hadn't been there until just now.

Is this "Rock Road"? Did it unfold hidden in the mist?

Before he knew it, his feet were immobilized, solidified up to the ankles.

How cunning of them!

But the body’s repair was almost complete.

As soon as he recovered, he would break free from here and trample everyone this time for sure!

<b>

<b>

『Assault Dash』

<b>

Bursting through the mist, the enemy suddenly appeared.

Wrapped in ominous holy energy, more densely than ever before.

This guy! Did he retreat to prepare this?!

The enemy's movements were abnormally fast!

<b>

『Power Smash』

The tip of the sword drew an arc at super speed horizontally.

The energy-laden blade approached right before him.

Instinctively, he brought his repaired right arm up to guard, but at that moment, the blade sank into that arm.

<b>

But with the enemy's strength, he couldn't sever my arm! That had been proven time and again!

When the sword's trajectory stopped, this time it would surely pierce his chest!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Power Smash" was the basic skill of strong strikes that Arvin had first learned from Suzy.

<b>

Using "Mass Increase" to greatly increase the weight of the two-handed sword, moving it at high speed with "Assault Dash," and striking down with the powerful impact of "Power Smash."

It was far too vicious a mass weapon for human hands to wield.

<b>

Its use would also impose excessive strain on the user's body, enhanced by magical equipment.

However, that single strike possessed the power to slice through even the solid Graviton alloy armor like paper.

<b>

The right arm that Van raised to guard was, contrary to his expectations, easily severed like clay.

It sliced through his thick chest and carried the blade toward its weak point.

<b>

The moment Arvin felt the blade of the two-handed sword reach there, he poured holy energy into it with all his might.

<b>

"Whoaahhhhhh――――――――――――――――――――――――！！！"

<b>

With a roar rising from his gut, the golden holy energy transformed into a torrent, scorching the undead body from the inside.

<b>

"Ugh!"

<b>

The golden holy energy rose as flames, bursting from his eyes and mouth.

As Arvin pulled the two-handed sword out, his body dropped to its knees as if losing strength, collapsing heavily onto the ground.

There was no sign of his severed right arm regenerating.

<b>

Once Arvin confirmed that, he firmly sank the tip of the two-handed sword into the ground, exhaling deeply as he relaxed his shoulders.
