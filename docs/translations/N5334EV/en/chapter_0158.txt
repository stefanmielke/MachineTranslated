# Episode 146: Suzy Cloud's Concerns

"Eh? Karen was already here?"

"Yes, she came all the way to tell me that she wanted to take the day off."

<b>

Alma-san continued, "She could have just sent a message, but she's really a serious girl."

<b>

That's right, Karen is serious and a good girl.

I know that well myself.

<b>

Moreover, recently, she has started to show her smile more than when we first met.

I believe that something is gradually changing within Karen.

<b>

I want to think that reducing her contact with those second sons and inviting her to train with Amukamu, which helped her get closer to Alicia, has had a positive influence.

I also hear that Lady Cordelia is looking out for Karen in ways that I can't see.

<b>

Both Karen and her surrounding environment are changing now.

Isn't it natural to worry about Karen because of that?

<b>

I might be called overprotective by someone again, but I can't help but worry about what I care about!

After all, something like yesterday just happened, so it's even more understandable!

<b>

Of course, I did squash the source of that worry last night!

I made sure to threaten that guy, saying, "If I see you in front of Karen again, I'll rip your head offâ™ª" I think that was perfect!

<b>

However, thanks to that, I received a long and strict scolding from Bibi... ouch.

Today, she keeps looking at me with suspicious eyes.

<b>

You know, this is just the day after yesterday, right? Even I wouldn't do something reckless in quick succession!

I have a sense of decency too!

<b>

Huh? Did I just feel Bibi's glare intensify? Huh? Was that just my imagination?

<b>

<b>

Even so, I can't help but be concerned about Karen right now.

To be honest, I would like to accompany her for the entire day.

<b>

If we've come this far, I wanted to go with her to the facility.

<b>

Even though I know she has changed recently, I can't help but remember how she used to be, anxious and wandering her gaze around.

Thinking about that makes me worry even more.

<b>

While I was working, lost in such thoughts, my hands tended to be absent-minded.

While cleaning before opening, I started moving my hands again after being scolded by Bibi and Mia.

<b>

I guess they were watching me.

Alma-san sighed softly and called me over.

<b>

"Su-chan, could you run an errand for me?"

<b>

I thought I was going to be scolded, but unexpectedly, those words came from Alma-san.

<b>

"Actually, we didn't have enough herbs ordered, so I need you to go to the usual store and ask for an additional order."

<b>

The large front yard is located on the street one block west of Alfalfa Boulevard.

The store where we order tea leaves and such is further down the main road on the east side of Alfalfa Boulevard.

In other words, it's relatively close to the area where Karen's facility is located.

Alma-san is asking me to go there and place an additional order.

<b>

"Take your time. You can go slowly and just check on things while you're there."

<b>

For some reason, she said that while looking in a completely different direction, almost like a scripted line.

I wonder... did she worry about me? 

<b>

"Ah, um... Is that alright?"

"I'm asking you to run the errand, so there's no problem at all."

<b>

Alma-san's words are gradually sounding suspicious, but it can't be helped.

Bibi and Mia are looking at me with eyes that say, "It can't be helped..."

So, I think I'll just gratefully accept Alma-san's kindness.

<b>

"Then, I'll go right away!"

"Remember, take your time, okay?"

<b>

With that, I left the store, grateful for Alma-san's thoughtfulness.

However, I feel bad about leaving the shop open for too long during work hours, so I plan to check on Karen and come right back.

If I run across the rooftops, I can get back quickly!

<b>

<b>

But as I was making my way to Alfalfa Boulevard, something suddenly caught my detection.

It's something that shouldn't be felt in a place like this.

<b>

What is going on?

Why are magical beasts appearing in the city?

<b>

As I quickly expanded my search area, I was able to detect multiple magical beasts all around.

They weren't clustered in one spot; they were scattered here and there.

They're not particularly strong magical beasts, but there are quite a few of them.

<b>

Most of them are scattered between the main road with the carriage station and the Maguarat River, in what is roughly called the citizen district.

<b>

Focusing on the magical beasts within my search range, I could read their names.

"Fairiya Dog."

A dog-like magical beast, huh?

<b>

The nearest one is about 200 to 300 meters away.

I can reach it with just a single jump.

I kicked off the cobblestones and leaped over the rooftops to get a visual on it from above.

<b>

If I were to describe its appearance, it looked like a dark gray, extremely muscular Great Dane.

Its body is large, standing over a meter tall.

Its fangs and claws are abnormally developed, and its magical beast-specific red eyes gleam with a ferocious light.

<b>

In terms of threat level, I don't think it even reaches "1," but for an ordinary person without combat skills, it would be a desperate opponent.

Even the guards would find it a significant threat if they couldn't coordinate effectively, even against just one.

<b>

And now, one of them was approaching a young girl right in front of ordinary people in a narrow alley.

She looked to be about the same age as Annie. I couldn't see any adults nearby that seemed to be her parents.

The guards were also not close by. They seemed to have noticed the magical beast from a distance, but they won't make it in time!

I'm currently about 20 meters above the ground. With a free fall from this height, I wouldn't make it in time either.

<b>

So, I decided to use a little trick.

I quickly deployed a "Magic Barrier" diagonally above myself.

The barrier's property is "Reflection," fully focused on "Physical Defense."

Then, I struck the barrier with my right palm!

The barrier shattered and disappeared upon impact, but my body rode the shock and shot straight toward the target.

In that instant, I broke the sound barrier, shattering a wall of white air.

<b>

Go-Su-Ro-Ri-Maid Kick!!!!!

As intended, my kick hit the dog's body squarely in the center.

<b>

Furthermore, the force of the kick shattered the cobblestones along with the dog's body, creating a small crater!

Oh no! Did I go too far?!

<b>

The girl who was about to be attacked was now frozen in shock, wide-eyed as she sat on the ground.

Is this really bad? I feel like I've done something quite flashy!

<b>

In a panic, I thought, "Isn't it bad if my face gets revealed?" and pulled out an item from my inventory to equip.

<b>

"Party Mask"

It's one of the accessory items that adorn the head.

Wearing it, I transformed into a gothic lolita maid with a queen-like mask!

A masked maid!

<b>

I feel like my suspiciousness has unnecessarily increased, but I think if I worry about it, I'll lose! No! I won't!

<b>

More importantly, I need to check if the girl is unharmed, so I tried to approach her... but the dog was still moving!

<b>

The lower half of the dog was completely obliterated, yet it was still trying to flail around with its front legs.

Moreover, the wound was writhing and trying to regenerate!

This thing, despite being weak, has a high regeneration ability?

<b>

That's so gross!

So annoyingly gross!

<b>

It was so disgusting that I kicked it hard against the wall!

<b>

It slammed against the wall and became a stain on it.

At this point, it seems it can't regenerate anymore after being destroyed this much.

<b>

When I refocused my attention to my surroundings, I noticed the guards were coming this way.

Since it seems the girl is unharmed, it would be best to leave it to them.

<b>

Right now, I'm more concerned about other places.

I detected a total of 10 magical beasts.

I just took down one, so there are 9 left.

Most of them are scattered in different locations.

There are about three that are grouped together, but... Arvin is nearby.

It seems like it would be impossible for just the guards, but Arvin should be able to handle them without much trouble.

For now, I'll leave that to him.

<b>

After I clear the others, I'll hurry over.

After all, that place should be where Karen and the twins are.

<b>

I kicked off the ground and leaped over the rooftops to head to the next scene.

I need to keep my speed down to avoid damaging the town, so it's a bit cumbersome! Damn it!

<b>

Still, what is going on with magical beasts suddenly appearing in the city?

What on earth is happening right now?!
