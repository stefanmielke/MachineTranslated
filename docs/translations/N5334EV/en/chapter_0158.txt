# 146 Susie Cloud's Concerns

What? Karen was already here, huh?"

He came to me and said, "Yes, I'd like to take the rest of the day off."

<blank>

Alma continued, "You really are a serious girl, even though you could have used a word of advice.

<blank>

Yes, Karen is a good, serious girl.

I know that very well.

<blank>

And recently, they are smiling more often than when I first met them.

I am sure that something is slowly changing in Karen.

<blank>

I would like to think that the fact that I have minimized my contact with those second sons, as well as the fact that I have become friends with Alicia by inviting her to Amcam's training sessions, has had a positive impact.

I heard that Miss Cordelia is also concerned about Karen in some way that I cannot see much.

<blank>

Both Karen and the environment surrounding her are changing now.

Isn't that why we are right to be concerned about Karen?

<blank>

Someone might call me overprotective or a "mom" again, but I'm still worried about what I worry about!

In general, I think it's no wonder, since something like yesterday just happened!

<blank>

I did, however, destroy the source of my concern last night!

He even threatened to pull her head off if she ever showed her face in front of him again! I think it's perfect!

<blank>

However, thanks to that, I got a long, hard and severe complaint from Bibi. ......

Today, too, he is looking at me with a disturbing look in his eyes.

<blank>

Oh no, it was yesterday, right? Even I wouldn't do something like that in a row, would I?

I also have a sense of decency!

<blank>

Huh? Did you feel like Bibi's eyes just tightened up? Huh? Is it my imagination?

<blank>

<blank>

Still, I still can't help but wonder about Karen right now.

If it were true, I would have stayed with him for the rest of the day.

<blank>

If he had come all the way here, I would have liked to have accompanied him to the facility.

<blank>

Even though I know that things have changed recently, I still remember the way Karen used to look at me when I was wandering around, looking at her with a wandering gaze.

Then you are no longer worried about them.

<blank>

Because I was working with such thoughts in mind, my hands tended to stay at home.

While cleaning up before opening the restaurant, Bibi and Mia started to move their hands after being warned by Bibi and Mia.

<blank>

He must have seen me like that.

Alma gave a small sigh and called me over.

<blank>

"Sue, can you run a few errands for me?"

<blank>

I thought I was going to get a warning, but Alma's mouth came out with words I didn't expect.

<blank>

'Actually, you know, I didn't order enough herbs, so I need you to go down to your regular store and ask for more.

<blank>

The large vestibule is one street west of Alfalfa Boulevard.

The store where our store orders tea leaves and other items is further down the main street on the east side of Alfalfa Boulevard.

As I say, the store is located relatively close to the district where Karen's facility is located.

Alma says to go there and put in an additional order.

<blank>

I'll be happy if you go and visit me slowly. You can go and see how things are going.

<blank>

I was told, "I'm not sure why," in a kind of barbed speech, while looking in the direction of the day after tomorrow.

I guess I got ...... caught off guard on this one? I knew it.

<blank>

Oh, uh, uh, ....... Is that okay?"

I'm the one who sent him on an errand. No problem at all.

<blank>

I can't help but feel that Alma's words are starting to smell fishy.

Bibi and Mia also look at me like, "What a pity! and they look at me like that. ......

Here, I would like to honestly and gratefully accept Alma's kindness for taking care of me.

<blank>

Well, I'll be right there!

So just take your time, okay?

<blank>

And so I left the restaurant, grateful for Alma's thoughtfulness.

However, I feel bad about opening the store for too long during the workday, so I'll just check on Karen and come back soon.

And if you run on the roof, you can come right back!

<blank>

<blank>

But as we were proceeding to exit to Alfalfa Boulevard.

Suddenly, something appeared that caught my detection.

It is something that should not be felt in a place like this.

<blank>

What does this mean?

Why are there demonic beasts springing up all over town?

<blank>

I immediately expanded my search area and was able to capture a number of magical beasts all over the place.

They are not clumped in one place. They are scattered here and there.

They are not very strong magical beasts, but there are a few of them.

<blank>

Most of them are scattered around the area between the main street where the carriage station is located and the Maggalat River, the so called "civic district".

<blank>

If you turn your attention to the magical beast within the search area, you can read its name.

Feyreya Dog."

Maybe a dog-shaped magical beast.

<blank>

In the meantime, the distance to the nearest guy is about 2-300 meters.

It's just a hop and a jump away.

I kicked the cobblestones, jumped over the roof, and sighted this guy from above.

<blank>

If I were to compare its appearance to a Great Dane, it would be a dark gray, severely muscled Great Dane with dark gray all over.

His body is large, and he looks to be over a meter tall.

Its fangs and claws are also abnormally developed, and its red eyes, characteristic of magical beasts, are filled with a maniacal light.

<blank>

I don't think there is a '1' in terms of threat value, but it is still a hopeless opponent for the average person with no combat value.

Even the guards, even one of them, can be a sufficient threat if they don't work well together and don't get hit.

<blank>

And now the one below me was closing in on the public in a narrow alley.

The girl is still about Annie's age. There are no adults nearby who appear to be her parents.

The guards are not nearby either. It seems that he noticed the beast from a little distance away, but this is too late!

The current altitude is about 20 meters above the ground. I can't free fall from this height, either.

<blank>

So let me use a little trick.

The "magic barrier" is quickly deployed diagonally above you.

The barrier characteristic is "Reflection". The attribute is "anti-physical".

He then strikes the barrier as hard as he can with the bottom of his right palm!

The barrier I hit shattered and disappeared at the moment of impact, but my body rode the impact and plunged in a straight line toward the target.

For that split second, it had exceeded the speed of sound and was breaking through a wall of white air.

<blank>

Go-S-lo-lo-li-maid-ki-yick: ！！！！

The kick hits the middle of Inukoro's body, not on target.

<blank>

Furthermore, the force of the kick shattered the cobblestones along with the dog's body, even creating a small crater!

Oh no! Did I overdo it?

<blank>

The girl who was about to be attacked was also frozen with her eyes wide open as she fell on her buttocks.

Are we in trouble? I'm getting the feeling that I've done something pretty spectacular!

<blank>

Immediately, I thought to myself, "Isn't this a bad way to reveal my face?" I took the item out of my inventory and put it on.

<blank>

Party Masks."

It is one of the accessory items that adorn the head.

Put it on and you have a gothic lolita maid wearing a queenly mask!

It's a masked maid!

<blank>

I feel like my sense of being unnecessarily suspicious has gone up a gazillion notches, but I don't care because I feel like I'm losing if I care! Unh! I won't!

<blank>

I was wondering if the girl was hurt. I tried to approach her to see how she was doing, but she was still moving ......!

<blank>

From the doggy's chest down, it is completely obliterated and gone, yet it is trying to jiggle with only its paws.

In addition, even the scars are wriggling and even trying to regenerate!

This guy is weak, but has great regenerative ability?

<blank>

It's so gross!

It's grossly annoying!

<blank>

It was so gross that I kicked him as hard as I could against the wall!

<blank>

It hits the wall, and the sole becomes a stain on the wall as it is.

Once the stone is destroyed to this extent, it seems that it cannot be regenerated.

<blank>

I looked around me again and saw that the guards were coming toward me.

The girl does not seem to be injured, so it is better to leave her to it.

<blank>

Now I'm more concerned about other places.

There were a total of 10 magical beasts that were caught in their own detection.

One has just been destroyed, so there are nine left.

Everyone is in different places except for a few.

There are about three of them clustered together at ....... But there's an Irving nearby.

If it were just the guards, it would be an impossible task, but Irving can kill these guys without any difficulty.

Let's leave that to them for now.

<blank>

After clearing out the others, I'll be on my way as soon as I can.

After all, the place is supposed to be the facility where Karen and the twins are.

<blank>

I kicked the ground on the spot, jumped over the roof and went straight to the next site.

It's a little sluggish because we are trying to keep the speed down so as not to destroy the city! Damn you!

<blank>

But still, how could a magical beast suddenly appear in this town?

What in the world is going on right now?
