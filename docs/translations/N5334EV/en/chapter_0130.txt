# 118 Selected Classes

Starting this week's afternoon classes, electives will be added.

<blank>

For now, just think of it as a confirmation that it's a good fit for you.

<blank>

Dr. Ursula told me that in the first year, it was just a confirmation of my aptitude for the time being.

This is an important choice that will affect the kind of "class" I will acquire in the future.

<blank>

Even so, Colin said, for people like Amcam, for whom combat is not a daily occurrence, this is just another status.

<blank>

This is not surprising, since the country has been battle-free for the past 150 years, except for occasional disputes on the borders and rare domestic disputes.

<blank>

Still! I'm sure the Amcam crowd will be excited, though!

<blank>

And the elective subjects can be roughly divided into "physics" and "magic.

I think this goes without saying.

<blank>

Even within the "physical" category, there are subdivisions such as "vanguard," "rear guard," and "search-and-rescue.

Irving, for example, says he'd choose one of the knightly families in the vanguard as well.

I knew he wanted to follow the riders.

Well, with Irving's current abilities, I think he will skip a grade and quickly become a full knight, just like Ryder.

<blank>

As an "axe-fighter," Lombardo is primarily a heavy-weapon fighter.

I heard that this is a class to raise "Berserkers" who are related to "Hercules" like Aria and Mr. Conrad.

...... but what the heck, "raising berserkers" is pretty coy when you just look at the letter of the phrase.

<blank>

<blank>

Naturally, the "magic" is also divided into options, such as attacker, recovery, or support.

I am an enchanter by nature, so my choice is the support department!

I don't know what it is, but I don't know what it is, and I don't know what it is that makes teachers say "What? Why the support?" I don't know what it was, but the teachers looked at me like, "What? But it doesn't matter, does it?

For the most part, you're already a "bard", right?

<blank>

Bibi is in the same support department as me.

But in Bibi's case, his goal is to be a "Soul Lord" just like his father, Silence, so he's a "poet" separated from the ritual system.

I'm with Colin on this one.

Well, Colin is a senior, so he is already a "Witch Doctor", one above a "Poet".

<blank>

<blank>

And Mia is in the magic department, as she should be.

I'm already a "magician," which is the basic job title, so this is no surprise.

<blank>

It seems that magical professions that can unleash flashy magic are very popular, and there are a good number of people who go that way.

<blank>

However, in the end, handling magic involves a great deal of inborn sense, such as a sense of balance and a sense of smell in handling magic. So, even if you can become a "sorcerer" or "wizard," there are not that many people who can become a "sorceress" or "arc mage," which are higher level jobs.

Well, Mia doesn't have to worry about that.

<blank>

Oh, by the way, Karen also said she was going to choose the magic department. ......

But looking at what I saw this morning, I don't know what to think, I think it's the 'empty fist family'.

<blank>

I think Alicia thinks so too.

I am sure Alicia would be disappointed if she knew that Karen would not choose the empty fist department.

<blank>

When I say this to Karen, she looks a little sad, saying, "My little father recommended .......

<blank>

Hmmm... ......, I guess it's all up to you to decide what you want to do.

Well, we can always change our choices after this, so in the end, I hope Karen will choose something she has no regrets about.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So in the afternoon, Bibi and I went to the support department, where we will be taking care of ourselves.

<blank>

When I entered the classroom, I found a familiar face and greeted him with a big smile on my face.

<blank>

This is Mr. Casper, how do you do?

Well! Mr. Cloud! How do you do? ...... And, Mr. Kuroki, ...... G'day."

"...... G'day!"

<blank>

Hmmm, what is it? I knew these two were strangely awkward.

I would like to get closer to Miss Cordelia.

<blank>

The first impression was a strong one, but I don't think the person is such a bad thing, and above all, I would like to ask for Karen, who is in the same class with me.

If possible, this is someone I would like to be friends with in the future.

<blank>

Both of them are smiling, but their masked faces are clearly visible, which is a little bit scary!

Bibi says that Miss Cordelia just sees her as a one-sided rival. ...... I'm not sure if it's a good idea to be softer with Bibi, but I'm not sure how to deal with her.

<blank>

...... I wonder if they are surprisingly similar to each other?

At any rate, it's scary, so just don't bat around in front of me, okay?

<blank>

Yes, sir! Dear Cloud! The other day you sent our Catherine some herbal tea! Thanks to you, she said she slept very well and was relieved from fatigue. I would like to thank you on her behalf.

I am so glad to hear that! I know I was a little forward to you when I saw you, because you didn't look so good, but I'm glad you're happy.

<blank>

That big girl is called Catherine, apparently. She seems to be in good health.

I'm glad I asked AnnaMary before the holidays.

<blank>

And, as I thought, Miss Cordelia is here because she is trying to transition from "bard" to "tamer" via "summoner", not "tamer" via "ranger".

<blank>

A little embarrassed, he told me that.

Yeah, do you think we'll manage to get along?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, the teacher in charge of this support department came into the classroom.

<blank>

I am Keira Shandra, your support department supervisor.

<blank>

The doctor who came was a strangely aged woman dressed well in a pants suit.

Her black hair, tucked up on top of her head, spills a raspberry-colored shine in the light.

He is a very sexy teacher who wears black-butted glasses but has a dynamite body that is not hidden by his suit!

<blank>

The buffer is a class that can raise the power of the entire party. Like the healer, the buffer is an essential part of the party. The presence or absence of a buffer can greatly affect the success rate of a mission or the probability of survival. Please fully understand this and learn from it."

<blank>

This teacher knows what he is talking about!

<blank>

Yes, that's right! It makes all the difference in the difficulty of the hunt if it's buffed or not!

If the buff runs out in the middle of a hunt, you could be in danger of being wiped out!

Managing buffs well is also an important job for buffers!

<blank>

I couldn't help but agree with the doctor's story all the time, and I got so excited that I clenched my fists and nodded my head every time.

So, Bibi, please don't look at me with such a stern look.

<blank>

<blank>

"We hope that students will choose the class that best suits their aptitude, taking into consideration the wide variety of classes that can be derived from the Department of Support and Supervision."

<blank>

While looking over the materials handed out, we go through an explanation of the support department.

Since today was the first day, after a brief self-introduction, we were to be shown a demonstration by the teacher in the "magic testing hall".

<blank>

Self-introductions were quickly completed, as there were only seven of us, including myself, Bibi, and Miss Cordelia.

I had predicted that buffer jobs would not be very popular because they are not flashy.

Well, I'm sure there will be fluctuations in people in the future.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And so we all decided to head to the "Magic Testing Center".

<blank>

Oh, when I say 'magic testing ground', that's the thing, I mean the place, like a shooting range, where we practiced magic shields when we engraved the spirit seal.

<blank>

They are supposed to use the school for their magic trials.

<blank>

So I came to the entrance of the proving ground and found something noisy inside.

I imagined that the kids from the magic department had already arrived and were watching the demonstration. I thought that they were already there and watching a demonstration, but something seemed a little strange.

<blank>

Mock battle? Freshmen? !"

And three to one?

"Two new students in the Department of Magical Arts? You're gonna make me do it?

<blank>

Homu? I'm hearing some disturbing words?
