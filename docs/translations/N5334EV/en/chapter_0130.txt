# Chapter 118: Elective Classes

From this week's afternoon classes, elective subjects will be added.

<b>

"First of all, please think of it as a confirmation of whether it suits you or not!"

<b>

Professor Ursula mentioned that during the first year, it's primarily about confirming one's suitability.

This is an important choice that will relate to what kind of 'class' one will acquire in the future.

<b>

That said, Colin pointed out that for people who don't engage in combat as a daily routine, like those from Amukam, this is merely a status.

<b>

Excluding the occasional disputes that arise at the borders or the rare conflicts within the country, itâ€™s understandable that this is the case, as the nation has lived without combat for the past 150 years.

<b>

Even so! There's no doubt that the Amukam folks are getting excited!

<b>

The elective subjects can be broadly divided into 'Physical' and 'Magic'.

I think this goes without saying.

<b>

Furthermore, even within the 'Physical' category, it gets subdivided into frontline, backline, and reconnaissance, among other things.

It seems that Irvin has chosen to focus solely on the knight class, which is a frontline role.

He apparently wants to follow in the footsteps of the Rider.

Well, given Irvin's current abilities, he might just skip grades and become a full-fledged knight in no time.

<b>

Lombard, who is an 'Axe Fighter', is in the warrior class that mainly handles heavy weapons.

This is a class that cultivates 'Berserkers', which are connected to 'Hercules' like Aria and Conrad.

...But, I don't know, just looking at the phrase "cultivating Berserkers" seems quite scary.

<b>

<b>

'Magic' also has options divided into attackers, healers, and support roles.

I'm inherently an enchantment person, so my choice is solely the support class!

For some reason, the teachers looked at me as if to say, "Huh? Why support?" But isn't it fine?!

After all, I'm already a 'Bard', right?!

<b>

Vivi is also in the same support class as me.

However, in Vivi's case, she aims to be a 'Soul Lord' like her father, Sir Silence, so she has branched into the priest type and is becoming a 'Poet'.

This is the same as Colin.

Well, Colin is a senior, so he is already one step above 'Poet' as a 'Witch Doctor'.

<b>

<b>

And Mia is, of course, in the magic department.

Since she has already become a basic class 'Magician', this is only natural.

<b>

It seems that flashy magic jobs are quite popular, and many people tend to go that route.

<b>

However, handling magic ultimately involves a significant amount of balance and instinct related to handling magical power, so while one can become a general class 'Magician' or 'Mage', not many can reach advanced classes like 'Sorceress' or 'Archmage'.

Well, Mia doesn't need to worry about such things at all.

<b>

Speaking of which, Karen also said she would choose the magic department...

But from what I saw this morning, I can't help but think she should choose 'Empty-Handed Combat'.

<b>

I think Alicia feels the same way.

If she finds out that Karen didn't choose 'Empty-Handed Combat', she might be quite disappointed.

<b>

When I told Karen that, she replied, "Because my uncle recommended it..." looking a bit lonely.

<b>

Hmm... I think this is something she should decide on her own.

Well, since she can change her choice anytime after this, I hope Karen ultimately chooses something she won't regret.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

With that said, in the afternoon, Vivi and I headed to the support class we would be taking care of.

<b>

When we entered the classroom, I spotted a familiar face and greeted them with a big smile.

<b>

"Ah, Lord Caspar, good day!"

"Oh! Lord Cloud! Good day. ...And, Lord Kuroki... good day."

"......Good day!"

<b>

Hmm, I wonder? These two seem to be a bit awkward with each other.

Personally, I would like to get closer to Lady Cordelia.

<b>

Although my first impression was strong, I don't think her personality is that bad, and more than anything, I want to look after Karen, who is in the same class.

If possible, I hope to get along with her in the future.

<b>

Yet both of them are smiling, but their masks are clearly showing, which is a bit scary!

According to Vivi, Lady Cordelia is just unilaterally viewing her as a rival... If that's the case, Vivi should approach her with a more gentle attitude, but her response is rather cold.

<b>

...I wonder if these two are surprisingly similar?

For now, since it's scary, please refrain from battling in front of me, okay?

<b>

"Indeed! Lord Cloud! The herbal tea you sent to our Catherine the other day! Thanks to you, she said she was able to sleep very well and felt refreshed. I would like to express my gratitude on her behalf."

"Well, that's wonderful to hear! When I saw her, her complexion wasn't great, so I thought it might be presumptuous of me, but I'm glad she liked it."

<b>

That big girl seems to be named Catherine. It seems she has gotten better.

I'm glad I asked Anna Marie to help before the holidays.

<b>

And, just as I thought, Lady Cordelia is here not to transition from 'Ranger' to 'Tamer', but to aim for a transition from 'Bard' to 'Summoner' to 'Tamer'.

<b>

She shyly informed me of this.

Hmm, I think we might be able to get along somehow?

<b>

<b>

<b>

While we were chatting, the teacher in charge of the support class entered the classroom.

<b>

"I am Keira Chandra, and I will be in charge of the support class."

<b>

The teacher who entered was a woman of a certain age, stylishly dressed in a pantsuit.

Her black hair, tied up on her head, sparkled with a raspberry hue in the light.

She wears black-framed glasses, but her dynamite body, which the suit can't hide, makes her quite a sexy teacher!

<b>

"The buffer class is one that can enhance the overall power of the party. Like healers, they are an essential presence in a party. The presence or absence of a buffer can greatly change the success rate of missions or survival rates. Please understand this well and learn accordingly."

<b>

This teacher knows what she's talking about!

<b>

That's right, exactly! The difference between having buffs and not having them makes a huge difference in the difficulty of hunting!

If buffs wear off during a hunt, it could lead to a total wipeout!

Managing buffs properly is also an important job for a buffer!

<b>

I couldn't help but agree with the teacher's words, getting excited and nodding vigorously.

So please stop looking at me with such suspicious eyes, Vivi.

<b>

<b>

"Considering that there are many classes derived from the support management class, I would like you to choose a class that suits your aptitude."

<b>

As I went through the distributed materials, I received explanations about the support class.

Since today is the first day, after a brief self-introduction, we were scheduled to watch a demonstration by the teacher in the 'Magic Practice Arena'.

<b>

The self-introduction was quick, as there were only seven of us, including me, Vivi, and Lady Cordelia.

I had predicted that the buffer's job wouldn't be very popular since it lacks flashiness.

Well, I think there will be some changes in the number of people from now on.

<b>

<b>

<b>

With that, we all headed towards the 'Magic Practice Arena'.

<b>

Ah, the 'Magic Practice Arena' is that place, the shooting range where we practiced the magic shield when we engraved the spirit seals.

<b>

It seems that when conducting magic trials within the academy, we are supposed to use that place.

<b>

When we arrived at the entrance of the practice arena, it was quite noisy inside.

I imagined that the students from the magic department had already arrived and were watching a demonstration, but something seemed a bit off?

<b>

"Mock battle?! New students?!"

"And it's 3 against 1?!!"

"Are they letting new students from the magic department fight each other?!"

<b>

Hmm? I hear some unsettling words coming from inside?
