# Chapter 205: The Battle of Two

I realized that I hadn't posted anything in August at all orz

I apologize! <m(__)m>

"Boona! What the hell is going on?!"

"Dolton?! You really came?!"

"I rushed to get the special carriage moving without taking anything!"

"…You made everyone go through this again, didn't you?!"

"More importantly! What on earth happened?! This looks like a disaster situation!"

<b>

"…There's no time, I'll be brief! About an hour ago, a large-scale stampede was confirmed at the Rohan Nature Park! The physical barrier of the nature park has already been activated!"

"At the nature park?! What about the children?! Are they safe?!!"

"I've received reports that the evacuation of the children has been completed! The first unit of the county knights should be arriving at the scene soon!"

"There haven't been any casualties, right?! But Boona, are you planning to go out there too?"

"Of course! This is no ordinary stampede! It's been confirmed that thousands of powerful magical beasts are coming from the depths! The physical barrier has been activated, but we don't know how long it will hold! Although unconfirmed, there are reports that parts of the barrier have already started to collapse, and magical beasts are heading towards this city! I will lead the county knights to exterminate the magical beasts!"

<b>

"…Damn it! Of all times, it's when she's not here!"

"What do you mean?"

"Nothing, never mind. More importantly, Boona! I'm borrowing an emergency pigeon!"

"One that's high-speed?! I don't mind, but what are you planning to do?!"

"I'm calling in the A-rank team from Amukam that helped with the academy's defense today! They should be able to arrive here by midnight!"

"I see, that's reassuring!"

"And Boona! Lend me a full set of equipment! I'm heading to the scene too!"

"…Fine. I'll have the butler prepare it right away. Get ready in five minutes!"

"Thanks. I appreciate it, Boona."

"Likewise! Your magical abilities are top-notch! I’m counting on you."

"It's to protect the children! Use as much as you need!"

"Of course! Now hurry up, Dolton! We'll set out as soon as we're ready!"

<b>

"…Damn it, I can't shake this uneasy feeling!"

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

The atmosphere creaks.

A fist thrusts out at overwhelming speed, compressing the air.

At the same time, distortions occur in the surrounding atmosphere.

The instant the air is compressed, it emits high heat and, wrapped in 'ki,' collides with the target, destroying and piercing through it with a fist-sized impact.

<b>

"Impact Knuckle"

That was how Suzy called the technique.

<b>

Not long ago, Irvin had demonstrated a sword energy technique called "Impact" in front of the shelter.

Karen had consulted Suzy about whether she could use it too.

<b>

Seeing that Karen was already accustomed to handling 'ki,' Suzy decided to teach her the basic form.

<b>

As expected, Karen understood where to gather 'ki' and how to move it after Suzy explained it.

After proper instruction on the form, she demonstrated the necessary circulation of 'ki' for activating the technique.

<b>

Once she took the form, Suzy Ai captured the solid movement of 'internal ki' within Karen's body at that moment.

<b>

When she instructed her to actually use the technique, Karen successfully activated it on the first try.

Even Suzy and Irvin were left speechless.

<b>

Irvin, who took a week to be able to use the "Impact" skill, was grimacing, asking, "What the hell is going on?!"

<b>

Normally, it should take years of training to be able to use it, yet here was Karen, achieving this in just one hour of instruction.

It was needless to say that Suzy's eyes were spinning in disbelief.

<b>

This was the situation that had both of them scratching their heads about a week ago during their usual morning practice at Amukam.

<b>

Karen had now become adept at combat using 'ki,' just like the young warriors of Amukam.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…Amazing."

<b>

That was the word that had been escaping Cordelia's lips repeatedly.

Karen was overwhelming the enemy.

<b>

The body of the "humanoid" was large, and its strength was extraordinary.

Each strike easily shattered the thick stone pavement.

Its beast-like movements were something an ordinary human could hardly catch.

<b>

However, Karen's movements surpassed that even further.

When the "humanoid" swung its fist, a gust of wind blew up around them.

Yet Cordelia's supportive magic complemented her combat style perfectly.

Like leaves dancing in the wind, Karen rode the wind, effortlessly dodging the approaching fists.

As Karen unleashed a spinning kick imbued with red magical energy, the "humanoid's" thick leg was mercilessly shattered.

<b>

When the heel wrapped in red light fell from above the "humanoid," it crushed its sturdy skull.

<b>

The technique unleashed from her fist struck the abdomen, scattering chunks of flesh around and creating a large gash.

<b>

However, after a while, flesh began to swell from within, covering the wound and leaving no trace behind.

<b>

The same result occurred for any damage inflicted.

New flesh quickly swelled up, concealing the injuries.

<b>

The swelling mass of flesh sometimes formed a human face.

And it wasn't just one or two; nearly ten faces emerged.

Most appeared on the surface only to sink back into the flesh, but a few remained on the surface, staring blankly into the void with unfocused eyes.

<b>

Among those grotesque faces were those of the once notorious carriage robbers known as Masuka and their companions, but Karen and Cordelia had no way of knowing this.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, the appearance of the "humanoid" was beginning to change drastically.

With each time Karen crushed its body, new parts sprouted from the areas that were repaired.

<b>

However, what sprouted was not solely human.

The crushed arm swelled with flesh, covered in coarse hair, resembling an ape's arm more than a human's.

The skin on the fist was so thick it was hard to believe it belonged to a human, and the elongated claws were truly beast-like.

The legs, which kicked off the ground to close the distance instantly, did not resemble those of a bipedal creature at all; they looked like the hind legs of a wolf.

The destroyed back began to be covered with thick scales resembling those of a crocodile rather than skin.

<b>

Earlier, she had felt the impact of her knee strike crushing what looked like a face belonging to Fluke.

The nasal bone and upper jaw had shattered under her knee.

The face was crushed, so much so that it could no longer eat with its upper jaw, as it had sunk into the interior of the face.

<b>

But that was quickly repaired.

Moreover, a longer snout began to grow in place of the original.

As the snout extended, the teeth changed, and all the teeth in its mouth transformed into sharp fangs that grew wildly.

<b>

It looked like the face of a wolf or a baboon.

These creatures could no longer be called human. They were beyond the realm of being "humanoid."

<b>

With wolf-like hind legs and two pairs of ape-like arms, they growled as they charged forward.

To an ordinary human, just standing before them would cause one to lose their sanity due to their grotesque and horrifying form.

How many humans and magical beasts had they absorbed into their bodies?

They were nothing more than a failed "synthesis beast."

<b>

Yet, Karen boldly attacked the horrifying synthesis beast.

<b>

The magical beast swung its massive arms like tree trunks in an attempt to swat Karen away, creating gusts of wind.

<b>

The magical beast stood on all fours, using its wolf-like hind legs and ape-like forelegs extending from its sides.

The two arms of its upper body, with a wider range of motion, swung continuously, leaving no room for Karen to escape, whipping up winds like a violent storm.

Its massive body, exceeding three meters in length, moved with high mobility using its wolf-like hind legs.

And whenever there was an opening, the third and fourth powerful arms extending from its sides would strike at Karen.

<b>

As the synthesis beast pursued Karen, winds swirled around, creating small whirlwinds.

Before this gigantic monster, the fate of this girl seemed like a flickering flame.

From the outside, it probably looked that way.

<b>

However, the wicked claws of the magical beast never reached Karen.

No matter how violently the beast's arms swung to capture their prey, they couldn't even graze her.

Only the red light of magical energy could be seen spilling out, indicating where Karen had moved.

<b>

When the beast's arm came crashing down for the umpteenth time, Karen's figure suddenly vanished from the synthesis beast's sight.

In the next moment, a powerful red light surged from below, and a strong impact pierced through the beast's jaw.

<b>

Having slipped into the beast's embrace, Karen instantly sank her body down, placing both hands on the ground.

With her hands firmly planted, she unleashed a powerful kick reinforced with red magical energy.

It struck the beast's jaw as if a pile driver had been driven from below, penetrating it in one blow.

That strike shattered the synthesis beast's jaw to smithereens, lifting its heavy body high into the air.

And as the ground shook, the beast collapsed onto the earth.

<b>

Taking advantage of that opening, Karen performed a backflip to create distance from the beast and catch her breath.

At that moment, Cordelia rushed over and called out to her.

<b>

"Karen! Are you okay?!"

"This is getting endless. I think it's getting a bit serious…"

<b>

Cordelia then cast "Body Recovery" towards Karen.

Karen's ragged breathing gradually calmed down.

<b>

At this moment, Karen was indeed overwhelming the synthesis beast.

However, the situation was not looking good. In fact, it was definitely heading in a bad direction.

<b>

With each damage inflicted, the synthesis beast increased its mass.

Karen felt like she wasn't making any progress at all.

Though it had fallen, it would surely stand back up without a scratch.

At this rate, she would undoubtedly be at a disadvantage.

<b>

As the teachers had said, no matter how much she destroyed around it, it would just keep repairing itself.

Deep within its body, there was a collective of "linear magical life forms," like a nerve network.

The only way to deal with it was to crush that!

<b>

<b>

At that moment, Karen sensed multiple presences approaching the high ground.

They soon revealed themselves.

Terra Dogs.

Four of them rushed up from the cliff below, charging towards the two.

Noticing the magical beasts, Karen's body moved towards them in an instant.

<b>

Wrapped in 'ki,' she executed a powerful heel drop that shattered the spine of one Terra Dog in a single blow, simultaneously bursting the "linear magical life forms" within.

As she twisted her body to deliver a kick to the second Terra Dog, a shadow passed by the corner of Karen's eye.

<b>

"Watch out! Run, Cordy!"

<b>

One Terra Dog was circling around to avoid Karen and was heading towards Cordelia.

Karen shouted out, but Cordelia calmly replied.

<b>

"That's perfect."

<b>

Cordelia pulled out another iron fan and opened it with both hands.

<b>

"I've grown a bit too!"

<b>

As she chanted a short incantation while holding the iron fan open, the wind began to gather around her.

<b>

The iron fan Cordelia was equipped with was a magical weapon crafted by Amukam, sent by Suzy.

The attached magical gem was of high purity, greatly enhancing the power of the spells she could cast.

<b>

To the Terra Dogs, Cordelia's outline likely appeared slightly blurred.

Nevertheless, the magical beast lunged directly at Cordelia.

However, the Terra Dog passed right through Cordelia's body.

<b>

"Deceptive Wind"

It was a spell that slightly miscalibrated the attack's aim, and Cordelia skillfully used it to elegantly evade the magical beast.

Then, she struck the beast's back with the iron fan she held.

<b>

The iron fan swung by Cordelia, crafted by Amukam, increased in hardness and mass at the moment of impact, just like Annie's pouch.

<b>

The forceful strike easily shattered the Terra Dog's spine.

The beast's back bent into a "knee" shape as it let out a high-pitched cry, collapsing on the spot.

That power was no less than the heel drop Karen had demonstrated earlier.

<b>

However, Cordelia's eyes widened in surprise at the result that exceeded her expectations, and her movements became somewhat unsteady.

<b>

Karen felt the same surprise at the unexpected outcome.

But at that moment, the last remaining Terra Dog lunged at Cordelia.

<b>

"Cordy!!"

<b>

Karen shouted again.

However, the magical beast missed its target, and its fangs did not reach Cordelia.

Once more, the iron fan was swung gracefully, crushing the Terra Dog's snout, while the other fan struck down, shattering its spine.

<b>

"…I'm surprised."

"You can rely on me a little, you know?"

<b>

With a slight blush on her cheeks, Cordelia showed a triumphant expression to her dearest friend, and Karen's mouth naturally relaxed after defeating the last magical beast.

<b>

Until now, Karen had been careful in her movements to prevent the enemy's attacks from targeting Cordelia.

But now, Cordelia seemed capable of handling things on her own.

Then! She would trust her and go all out!

<b>

"I got it, Cordy. Can you lend me a bit more strength?"

"Of course!"

<b>

At that moment, the crushed jaw of the "synthesis beast" that had been blown away began to stand up again.

And as if unable to contain its rage, it let out a cry that seemed to pierce the heavens.

<b>

<b>

—No matter how tough the opponent, they are still living beings.

If you continue to inflict damage beyond their limits, most of the time, it will come to an end.

However, there are some that are truly insurmountable due to their vast magical power and stamina.

For those, you just need to break them from the inside.

Nerves and blood vessels are crucial organs for circulating magical energy and 'ki' within the body.

You have to smash this from the inside! —

<b>

<b>

When I learned this technique, passed down from my uncle, I didn't fully understand what it was.

At the time I learned it, I didn't even grasp the existence of 'ki,' let alone how to handle it.

But after learning to handle 'ki' from everyone at Amukam, I finally began to understand.

This technique involves circulating condensed 'ki' within the opponent's body and rapidly converging it to destroy them from the inside.

It is not something to be used recklessly against people. The deeper your understanding of 'ki,' the more you realize the horror of this technique.

<b>

Until a little while ago, I would have thought this technique was beyond me.

But now, I can do it! Against this magical beast, I can do it!

No! I will show that I can do it!!

<b>

"…Karen? You seem a bit excited?"

"Eh? Is that so?"

<b>

Indeed, I had been feeling a bit exhilarated for a while now.

Moving my body was truly enjoyable.

I certainly felt a thrill in this tension.

Above all, the sense of unity gained from being wrapped in Cordelia's magical power further heightened her excitement.

<b>

"Maybe it's because I'm with Cordy?"

"Eh?"

"I'm really happy to be able to fight alongside you like this!"

"――――!"

<b>

Perhaps due to the exhilaration, Cordelia's heart skipped a beat as she looked at Karen, whose cheeks were faintly flushed and eyes sparkling.

However, she quickly placed a hand on her chest, quietly exhaling to calm herself.

<b>

"Still, Karen. Please don't overdo it. …I have a bad feeling about this."

"I'm fine, Cordy! If we're together, we can do anything!"

<b>

She was so reliable. Yet for some reason, Cordelia's heart stirred slightly.

Even so, her desire to meet Karen's expectations was strong.

<b>

"Alright! Let's do this!! I’ll leave the back to you!"

"I understand! I will definitely support you, Karen!"

<b>

Encouraged by Cordelia's voice, Karen began to run towards the synthesis beast.

When the beast noticed Karen, it scowled with malice, baring its fangs.

Letting out a low growl as if to drum, the beast lunged at Karen.
