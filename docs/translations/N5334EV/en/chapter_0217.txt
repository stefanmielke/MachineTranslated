# 205 The Battle of the Two

I realized that I never posted anything in August ORZ

My apologies! <m(__)m>

Boner!　What's this all about!"

Dalton?　You're really here? !!!"

I drove the specially equipped wagon for all I could get my hands on!"

"...... you've been reckless around me again, haven't you?!"

I don't care about that!　What the hell happened?　This is just like a disaster, isn't it?

<blank>

'...... no time, I'll be brief!　A massive stampede was confirmed at Rohan Nature Park about an hour ago!　They have already activated the physical boundaries of the nature park!"

"A nature park?　What's going on with the kids?　Are they safe?

The report is that the evacuation of the children is complete!　The first wave of county knights should be arriving there shortly!"

No damage, huh?　But Bona, are you going to leave too?"

Of course not!　This is no ordinary stampede!　We've also confirmed that powerful monsters are coming up from the depths by the thousands!　The physical warding has been activated, but I don't know how long it will last!　There are unconfirmed reports that some of the wards have already begun to crumble and that the demonic beasts are heading towards this city!　From now on, I will lead the county knights to defeat the demonic beasts!"

<blank>

'...... shit!　This is the time of year when she's not here by choice!"

What?"

No, it's nothing. More importantly, Bona!　I need to borrow your emergency pigeon!"

"Is it the high speed version?　I don't mind, but what are you going to do about it?

I'll call up the A-rank team from AMCAM that was assigned to defend the school today!　They can be here after midnight!"

That's reassuring!

And Bona!　Lend me a set of gear, too!　I'm on my way!"

"...... fine, I'll have the butler get it ready right away, you have 5 minutes to get ready!"

It helps. Thank you, Bona."

I'm here to help you!　Your magic is first class!　I'll be counting on you."

It's for the protection of the children!　Spend as much as you want!"

Of course!　Now hurry up and get ready, Dalton!　We'll go out as soon as we're ready!"

<blank>

...... damn it, I can't get this off my chest anyhow!"

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

The atmosphere creaks.

Fists are thrust out with overwhelming speed and air is compressed.

At the same time, the surrounding atmosphere was distorted.

The instantaneously compressed air emitted high heat, and furthermore, it struck the target while clothed in Ki, destroying and penetrating the area to the size of a fist.

<blank>

Impact Knuckle."

That's what Suzy called the technique.

<blank>

Not long ago, in front of the shelter, Irving unleashed and showed off his "Impact-type" skill of flying his sword ki.

Karen asked Susie if she could use it for herself.

<blank>

Seeing that Karen was used to handling Ki, Susie decided to teach her the basic kata.

<blank>

Sure enough, Karen understood where to store "Ki" and how to move it after teaching.

After the proper kata instruction, I showed him how to perform a normal ki circulation, which is necessary to activate the technique.

<blank>

If we take a mold, Susie Eye was able to capture the movement of the solid "uchi ki" within Karen's body at that time.

<blank>

When I instructed him to actually use the technique, he succeeded in activating it successfully the first time.

Both Suzy and Irving were stunned.

<blank>

Irving, who had been able to use his 'impact-type' skills for at least a week, asked, "What the hell is this all about?!" He scrunched up his face.

<blank>

Usually, it takes years of training to be able to use it.

Even ignoring Irving's extraordinary skills, Suzy's eyeballs were still rolling in circles as she asked, "How is this possible after only an hour of teaching? Needless to say, Suzy's eyeballs were whirling around in a whirlpool.

<blank>

It was during the usual amcam morning practice about a week before now that the two of us had our heads in the sand like that.

<blank>

Karen was now as skilled in fighting with "Ki" as the young Amcam warriors.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"...... awesome."

<blank>

These are words that have spilled out of Cordelia's mouth many times since a few minutes ago.

Karen is dominating her opponents.

<blank>

The body of the "humanoid" is large, and its strength is unusual.

The blow easily shatters even thick cobblestone pavement.

Even the beastly movements cannot be caught by an ordinary human being.

<blank>

But Karen's moves were even more impressive.

When the "humanoid" raises his fist, a gust of wind blows up around the area as if a gust of wind blew.

However, Cordilia's auxiliary magic is compatible with her fighting style.

The wind carried Karen's body like leaves dancing in the wind, and she easily avoided the approaching fist.

The wind in the wind, Karen, with her momentum, unleashes a spinning kick that is tinged with red magic power, and the thick legs of the "humanoid" are crushed mercilessly.

<blank>

Its red glowing heels would shatter even the stout skull of a "humanoid" if dropped from above its head.

<blank>

The belly, where the technique from the fist had struck, was also heavily gouged, scattering pieces of flesh around the area.

<blank>

But after a while, the flesh rises from the inside, covering the wound to a large extent and leaving no trace of it.

<blank>

Wherever the damage is inflicted, the result is the same.

Immediately new flesh rises to cover the wound.

<blank>

Sometimes the rising mass of flesh forms the shape of a human face.

And it's not just one or two. They number nearly a dozen.

Most of them appear on the surface and then sink back into the flesh, but a few remain on the surface.

The faces that appeared did not look at Karen and the others, but simply stared into the void with unfocused, vacant eyes.

<blank>

Among these fearless faces, Karen and Cordelia have no way of knowing the faces of the carriage robbers, once known as the Muscats, and their friends.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now, the appearance of the "humanoid" was beginning to undergo a major transformation.

Every time a body is crushed by Karen, new parts grow in the area to be repaired.

<blank>

But it was not only human things that grew.

The crushed arm is covered in bristles as the flesh rises and looks more like the arm of an ape than a person.

The skin on his knuckles is too thick to be human, and his extended claws are truly those of a beast.

The legs that kick the ground and instantly close the gap between them are not those of a bipedal creature, no matter how you look at it. They are like the hind legs of a wolf.

The destroyed back was beginning to be covered with thick scales that looked more like crocodile than skin.

<blank>

I just crushed a Fluke-like face from the front with a knee kick.

He felt the response of the entire nasal bone and the maxilla shattered.

The face was crushed and reduced to the inside of the face to the point that it was impossible to eat anything coarsely with the upper jaw.

<blank>

But it quickly mends itself.

At the same time, there comes a longer snout than the original one extending out of it.

As the nasal surface grows, the teeth also grow in, and all the teeth in the mouth turn into sharp fangs that grow in a messy manner.

<blank>

He looks like a wolf or a baboon.

Their appearance cannot be called human any more. They are not even in the category of "human-like creatures.

<blank>

It snarls at the ground with its wolf-like hind legs and two pairs of ape-like forelegs.

It is a horribly fearless and distorted form that would make any normal human being lose his or her mind just by standing in front of it.

How many humans and magical beasts have you taken into your body?

It is a "synthesized beast" that is not even close to being ready yet.

<blank>

However, Karen boldly attacked the fearless synthetic magical beast.

<blank>

The magical beast swings its vicious arm like a log in a series of violent swings and winds up in order to strike Karen down.

<blank>

The magical beast stands on the earth like a four-legged beast with wolf-like hind legs and monkey-like front legs that extend from its flanks.

The two arms of her upper body, which have a wider range of motion, swing around in a continuous motion, as if they have no chance to escape, creating a storm-like wind around her.

The huge body, which is almost over three meters long, uses the hind legs of a wolf to move with high maneuverability.

And if there is an opening, a third or fourth stiff arm, extending from the side, will also attack to catch Karen.

<blank>

Every time the synthetic magical beast chases after Karen, a small whirlwind rises up, with the wind dancing around it.

In front of this huge monster, this girl's fate is a windfall.

It probably looks that way from the outside.

<blank>

But the claws of the vicious hexenbiest never reach Karen.

No matter how violently the arms of the magical beast moved to seize its prey, it was not even able to snatch it.

Only the red magic light can be seen spilling out and disappearing, as if to indicate after Karen had moved.

<blank>

When the arm of the hexenbiest is struck down for the umpteenth time, Karen's image suddenly disappears completely from the synthetic hexenbiest's view.

The next moment, a powerful red light rose from below, and a powerful impact pierced the jaws of the magical beast.

<blank>

Karen, who had entered the bosom of the magical beast, instantly sank her body down, and reached for the ground with both hands.

Karen, who placed her hands on the ground as if firmly pressing down on it, released a powerful kick with her legs, strengthened with red magic power.

It pierced the jaws of the demonic beast with a single blow, as if a pile-driver had been driven into it from below.

The blow shatters the jaws of the synthetic magical beast into tiny pieces and lifts its heavy body high into the air.

Then, shaking the area, the magical beast fell back to the earth.

<blank>

Karen takes the opportunity to distance herself from the magical beast, doing backflips to catch her breath.

Then Cordilia hurriedly approached and called out to him.

<blank>

Karen!　Are you okay?

I'm not sure how much of a quirk this one is. I still think it's a little bit tasteless. ......"

<blank>

As it was, Cordilia turned to Karen and chanted "Physical Recovery.

Karen's ragged breathing quietly regains its composure.

<blank>

Right now, Karen is indeed dominating the synthetic magical beasts.

However, the situation is not good. In fact, it is definitely going in the wrong direction.

<blank>

With each damage inflicted, the synthetic magical beast increases the mass of its body.

Karen doesn't feel like she is cutting at all.

Now he's down, but he'll be back on his feet soon with no damage.

If this continues, we are definitely losing ground.

<blank>

I knew it was as the teachers had said.

No matter how much you crush the surroundings, they repair one after another.

Deep within the body, there is a collection of "linear magical organisms" like a plexus.

We have to destroy it!

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, Karen felt multiple signs coming up toward this high ground.

Soon they will show themselves.

Terra Dog.

Four of them, one after another, ran up from the bottom of the cliff and ran toward the two of us.

Karen's body was aware of the magical beast, and the next moment she was moving toward it.

<blank>

The heel drop, which is clothed in "Ki" and performed in a large flexing motion, shatters the tera dog's spine with a single blow, and at the same time, the "linear magical life form" inside the body also flies off.

A shadow passed out of the corner of Karen's eye as she twisted her body to kick the second terra dog.

<blank>

No, you can't!　Run, Cody!"

<blank>

One of the terra dogs had circled around Karen to avoid her and was heading toward Cordillera.

Karen caught it and raised her voice, but Cordelia quietly returned her words.

<blank>

Just the way I like it.

<blank>

Cordilia, who took out another iron fan, opened it in both hands and showed it to the audience.

<blank>

I'm growing up a little too!"

<blank>

She chants a short prayer of congratulation with her iron fan outstretched, and the wind begins to gather around her.

<blank>

The "Iron Fan" that Cordelia is now equipped with is a magical armament sent by Suzy and made by AMCAM.

The magic beads attached are of high purity and greatly increase the power of the magic to be activated.

<blank>

To the eyes of the terra-dogs, Cordelia's outline must have appeared slightly blurred.

Regardless, the hexenbiest jumped head-on at Cordelia.

However, the terra dog slips through Cordelia's body.

<blank>

The Wind of Deception

Although the magic slightly misjudged the attack, Cordelia used it brilliantly and showed that she could easily avoid the magical beast.

Then, as it was, he slammed the iron fan in his hand against the back of the magical beast.

<blank>

The iron fan wielded by Cordelia, which is made of amcam, greatly increases in hardness and mass at the moment of impact, just like Annie's pochette.

<blank>

The deadly weapon struck down with such force that it easily shattered the spine of the terrier dog.

The magical beast has its spine snapped 'in the shape of a bow' and is screaming in a high-pitched voice, limping on all four legs on the spot.

The power of this technique is comparable to the heel drop that Karen showed earlier.

<blank>

However, Cordelia's eyes were wide open and her behavior became somewhat suspicious.

<blank>

Karen's eyes widened at the unexpected result, as did hers.

But then the last of the terra dogs was there, facing Cordilia and pouncing on her.

<blank>

Cody!

<blank>

Again Karen raises her voice.

However, the demonic beast still had the wrong target, and its fangs did not reach Cordelia.

And once more, the iron fan swung as if dancing crushed the nose of Terror Dog, and as a finishing blow, the other iron fan also shattered the spinal cord.

<blank>

...... surprised me."

You can count on me a little, can't you?"

<blank>

Karen's mouth naturally relaxes at the sight of her beloved friend, who has just slaughtered his last magical beast, his cheeks slightly upturned and his face smug.

<blank>

Until now, Karen had been fighting while taking care to stand her ground so that the enemy's attacks would not be directed at Cordelia.

But I think Cordelia can handle it on her own now.

If so!　Let's trust her and go at it with all our might!

<blank>

I understand, Cody. Can you help me just a little bit more?"

Of course!"

<blank>

At that moment, the "synthetic beast" with its shattered jaw repaired rises.

Then, as if his anger was unbearable, he let out a heaven-shattering cry on the spot.

<blank>

<blank>

--No matter how tough your opponent is, he or she is still a living creature.

If you keep doing damage beyond the limit, you usually get more.

But some of them are really out of bounds with their enormous magical and physical power.

Those who say so should be destroyed from the inside out.

Nerves and blood vessels are important organs for circulating magic power and Ki within the body.

We're going to smash this thing from the inside! --

<blank>

<blank>

When my uncle taught me that technique, which he called oral transmission, I didn't really understand what it was.

It is no wonder that when I was first taught this, I did not yet understand the existence of Ki, let alone how to handle it.

But after learning how to handle Ki from everyone at AMCAM, I finally began to understand.

This is a technique in which kneaded Ki is circulated inside the opponent's body and rapidly converges to destroy him from the inside.

It is not something that should be used without caution, not even against people. The more one understands about Ki, the more one understands the horror of this technique.

<blank>

Not long ago, I would have considered it a skill that was too much for me.

But if it's me now!　I can do it against this magical beast!

Nope!　I'll show you!

<blank>

"...... Karen?　Sounds like a little fun?"

What?　Really?"

<blank>

Indeed, I had felt a bit of an upsurge in feelings earlier.

Physical exercise is still fun.

I am sure that this tension is also something that excites me.

Above all, the sense of oneness she gained from being enveloped by Cordelia's magic power was even more exciting for her.

<blank>

Is it because I'm with Cody?"

Huh?"

I'm kind of happy to be fighting with Cody like this!"

"----!"

<blank>

Cordelia's heart beats involuntarily as she gazes at Karen, whose cheeks are slightly tinted with a hint of elation and her eyes sparkling.

But immediately he puts his hand on his chest and exhales quietly, trying to calm down.

<blank>

Still, Karen. Don't take it easy. I have a bad feeling about ...... something."

It's okay, Cody!　Together we can do anything!"

<blank>

She is so dependable. And yet, for some reason, Cordelia's heart is slightly in an uproar.

Still, the desire to live up to Karen's expectations is great.

<blank>

I'll do it! I'll try!　You take care of the back!"

I understand!　I will definitely support Karen and show her how it's done!"

<blank>

As if pushed by Cordelia's voice, Karen starts running toward the synthetic magical beast.

When the hexenbiest sees Karen, it wrinkles its brow in hatred and bares its fangs.

With a low, drumming roar, the beast leaped toward Karen.
