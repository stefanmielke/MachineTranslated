# Episode 55: The Cloud Family's Maid

Happy New Year!

<b>

This is the first update of the new year!

----------------

<b>

Currently, there are 41 housemaids working at Amukam House, also known as the "Northern Palace."

<b>

Their main job is to maintain the vast old estate of the former border lord.

Additionally, during events such as the harvest festival, it is not uncommon for important guests to visit this castle. Hosting these guests is one of their important duties.

These maids are always expected to maintain a high level of quality in their work.

One day, a shock ran through them.

<b>

Just the other day, it was said that the Cloud family was looking for a maid for their daughter.

The daughter of the Cloud family... in other words, Suzy Cloud.

<b>

<b>

It has been over 150 years since the abolition of the nobility system.

The existence of nobility has long since disappeared from society.

However, for those living in Amukam, the Cloud family remains the leader who unites the civil guard and leads Amukam.

<b>

For the people of Amukam, the daughter of the Cloud family is, in essence, their lord's "princess."

Furthermore, Suzy has many admirers due to her abilities.

Of course, most of the maids were among them.

<b>

Many maids stepped forward to apply for the position of maid.

The selection process was said to be extremely fierce...

But from among them, Anna Marie Bylos won the right to serve as Suzy's maid.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“...Um, I can do it by myself...”

“It's alright, my lady. Just leave everything to me.”

“N-no... that's not what I meant... huh? Ah? Huh? ...Eh?”

<b>

Dragged into the bathroom, Suzy protested that she could undress herself and bathe alone, but her words were in vain as Anna Marie skillfully removed her clothing one piece at a time with flowing movements.

<b>

“U-uh? W-wha?”

<b>

In the beautifully decorated bathroom, filled with tiles and adorned with intricate embroidery, Suzy now stood in just her panties on a bath mat that displayed vibrant geometric patterns.

From behind the screen made of reeds, white steam began to rise, attempting to envelop the bathroom in mist.

It was clear that a large tub filled with warm water awaited her on the other side of the screen.

<b>

Next to the bath mat, a large basket was quickly filling up with the clothes Suzy had just been wearing.

As she stood on the mat and glanced at the mirror in front of her, she was shocked to see her own reflection, wide-eyed and exposing her small but shapely breasts.

She felt her face heat up rapidly.

Suzy hurriedly tried to cover her chest with both hands and was about to protest to Anna Marie, but...

<b>

“Now, my lady, let’s put this in the basket too.”

<b>

Before she could react, Anna Marie swiftly stripped away the last piece of fabric that had been Suzy's final barrier.

Suzy felt the two soft mounds on her back bounce as they were suddenly exposed.

<b>

“...Nya?! N-no! What?!”

<b>

In a panic, she moved her right hand in front of her, but then realized that Anna Marie, who had crouched down to remove the last piece, was at the same height as her legs. Even though she hadn't even entered the bath yet, her face was turning redder by the second.

<b>

Anna Marie must have clearly seen that part, but she continued to act as if nothing had happened and tossed Suzy's small piece of fabric into the laundry basket.

<b>

Suzy momentarily regained her composure from the shock of Anna Marie's nonchalant actions and quickly grabbed a towel that was piled up in front of her, using it to cover her body.

Since it was a hand towel, it only covered the front, making her feel even more exposed, and her face continued to heat up uncontrollably.

<b>

“My lady, please go ahead and soak in the water.”

<b>

Anna Marie spoke to Suzy while still holding the laundry basket.

It seemed she intended to take the basket to the laundry area just like that.

<b>

Still covering her naked body with the hand towel, Suzy cautiously moved behind the screen.

<b>

“I'll clean up right away, so please enjoy the bath.”

<b>

With that, Anna Marie took the basket filled with Suzy's clothes and exited the bathroom.

Suzy glared at Anna Marie with narrowed eyes until she confirmed that she had left, then let out a big sigh and relaxed her shoulders.

<b>

Turning back to the entrance of the bathroom, she saw the familiar white porcelain bathtub of the Cloud family.

Inside the beautifully curved tub, plenty of steaming water awaited Suzy.

<b>

Though she felt a bit anxious about Anna Marie's actions, it was a rare opportunity for a bath. There was no option but to enter.

After all, she had spent a week only bathing in water. Her body craved a proper bath! Suzy obediently followed her heart's desire and dipped her white legs into the tub.

<b>

As she slowly sank her body into the water, the overflow splashed out of the bathtub, making a sound as it hit the tiled floor.

The sound of the water flowing echoed in the room, and the steam rising from the spilled water further obscured her vision.

<b>

“Ahhh~~...”

<b>

As she soaked in the water, a sigh-like sound escaped her lips.

<b>

“It feels so good~~”

<b>

Having the memory of living in the country of Hinomoto, it was only natural for her to let out a sound upon entering the water.

The phrase "Paradise, paradise" floated into her mind.

<b>

“This is just too nice~~”

<b>

It had been a week since her last bath. The comfort of the water seeped into every part of her body.

Without thinking, she stretched her body in the tub.

<b>

Ignoring the splashing water that spilled over the bathtub, she stretched widely. The sound of water splashing echoed in the bathroom.

When she looked down at her body submerged in the water, she noticed a shadow of the same color as her hair gently swaying below her abdomen.

Remembering that Anna Marie had said she would be back soon, she felt an inexplicable sense of embarrassment.

For the time being, she used the hand towel to cover her body in the water.

<b>

(Huh? Wait? Doesn’t this feel strangely erotic in a way?)

<b>

“My lady! I’m back!!”

“Ahh?!”

<b>

At that moment, Anna Marie opened the bathroom door, causing Suzy to let out an unexpected strange sound.

She jumped in the bathtub, splashing water everywhere.

<b>

“I apologize for keeping you waiting, my lady. I will attend to you right away.”

<b>

(I... no, I wasn’t waiting... and I’m fine with your help...)

<b>

Ignoring Suzy's inner thoughts, Anna Marie rolled up her sleeves and approached the bathtub.

With her face half-submerged in the water, bubbles rising, Suzy thought.

<b>

(When I first came here, I wasn't this embarrassed when Elrose washed me... Why am I so embarrassed with Anna Marie? Is it because she’s closer in age? Or is it because she’s an older sister figure? Either way, my sense of shame seems to be overly sensitive... Oh, is that it? My sense of shame?! It’s growing, isn’t it?! At first, I had a low awareness of shame! I didn’t mind being seen in my panties! Now, my sense of shame has grown properly! If Mia were to lift my skirt, I’d be frozen in place with embarrassment! This means I’m really growing up!! Yes!)

<b>

“Now, my lady, let me wash your hair.”

“Wha?!”

<b>

While Suzy was lost in her thoughts about her sense of shame, Anna Marie had rolled up her sleeves, finished preparing for the bath, and gently lifted Suzy's head from the water to the edge of the tub.

Suddenly grabbing her head, Suzy let out another funny sound.

<b>

“Ah, wait! I can do it by myself...”

“Please be quiet, my lady. Just close your eyes; it will sting otherwise.”

<b>

Without giving Suzy a chance to protest, Anna Marie turned on the shower and began to lather the shampoo in her hair.

<b>

“Relax and just enjoy.”

<b>

As she said this, Anna Marie gently washed Suzy's hair.

<b>

“You must have exposed your hair to the elements for a week, right? I will take good care of it, so please wait a moment.”

<b>

(Oh right, I haven’t taken care of my hair for a week... Anna Marie's hands feel so nice... Maybe I should just let her take care of it...)

<b>

“Um... please... take care of it...”

“Of course, leave it to me.”

<b>

As she lay back in the tub, with her hair and head resting on the edge, Anna Marie's hands massaging her were more pleasant than she had expected, and Suzy found herself surrendering to the sensation.

<b>

“Ahhh...”

<b>

The pleasure was so overwhelming that a sigh-like sound escaped her lips.

<b>

“Um, Anna Marie!”

<b>

Feeling embarrassed by the sound she had unintentionally made, Suzy spoke up to Anna Marie.

<b>

“My lady, it’s Anna Marie. There’s no need for honorifics. Just call me ‘Anna Marie’.”

“B-but it feels a bit strange to call someone older than me by their first name...”

<b>

“You're so kind, my lady... But didn’t the lady also call Elrose by her first name? It’s only natural for a master to call their servant by their first name. I am your servant!”

“...But I still feel a bit resistant... Besides, I’m not that important...”

<b>

“My lady... you don’t understand your own position... I see, then this is my request. As long as I am taking care of you, could you please call me ‘Anna Marie’ without honorifics?”

“Eh? Is that... a request?”

<b>

“Yes, it is a request. By being called by my first name by you, I can feel the connection of serving you and that it is a solid proof of it. I understand it may be presumptuous to ask, but... would you please consider it?”

“That’s... a bit too presumptuous... Um, Anna Marie...? It still feels a bit off...”

“Thank you, my lady. Please get used to it little by little.”

<b>

As they conversed, Suzy felt her wariness towards Anna Marie gradually melting away.

Well, it was originally a wariness stemming from being suddenly stripped of her clothes... but Anna Marie's massage was just too pleasant. For Suzy, feeling good was justice!

<b>

(After all, being naked together is important for bonding between people...)

<b>

She thought about that. Of course, she was the only one who was naked...

<b>

Eventually, after her head was washed, she received a facial wash and a cream massage around her face and neck, causing Suzy's pleasure levels to soar.

She had already lost any resistance to having her shoulders and arms massaged and washed, and before she knew it, even her body and delicate areas were being washed by Anna Marie's hands.

<b>

As a result, if a strange sound escaped her, it was only natural.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

****************************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Wrapped in a bath towel, Suzy sat in front of the mirror while Anna Marie dried her hair.

Suzy's cheeks reflected in the mirror were far too red for someone who had just come out of the bath.

<b>

(I... I made a strange sound, didn’t I? What should I do...? Did she think I’m a weird person? But... in that situation... like that... Ugh! Anna Marie didn’t change her expression at all, so maybe she’s just ignoring it? She’s so mature... Ugh, ugh!)

<b>

While Suzy was lost in her thoughts about the glossy sound she had made, Anna Marie continued brushing her hair.

As she surrendered to it, she felt so good that her consciousness began to melt away.

<b>

(This is bad... Anna Marie's massage... it might become an addiction... The brushing feels good too... At this rate, I really feel like a lady... This is troubling...)

<b>

<b>

<b>

Eventually, as her wet hair dried, Anna Marie tried to put underwear on her, but Suzy, determined to do it herself, tried to refuse. However, once again, her resistance was futile against Anna Marie’s skillful hands, and she ended up allowing Anna Marie to put on her underwear.

<b>

Suzy felt as if she had lost something important, but she couldn’t take her eyes off her reflection in the mirror.

<b>

“Th-this is!!”

<b>

It was 1.5 times larger than usual.

<b>

Suzy looked down at her chest, then at the mirror, then back at Anna Marie, repeating this several times...

<b>

“Whaaa! My cleavage! ...Well, I mean, I had cleavage before, but... these mountains are sticking out so much!”

<b>

It was the result of the push-up effect.

<b>

“People would call me a winner!!”

<b>

With this, I can win! Suzy thought.

What she was winning at was unclear.

<b>

However, the true winner was Anna Marie... but Suzy was captivated by her reflection in the mirror.

Changing poses, she was thoroughly pleased with her chest that was asserting itself like never before.

<b>

Anna Marie, watching her with warmth, also seemed satisfied.

<b>

“I will make sure to take care of you every day from now on.”

<b>

At those words, Suzy snapped back to attention and looked at Anna Marie.

Then, stepping forward while extending her hand...

<b>

“Um, Anna Marie...”

“Just Anna Marie, my lady.”

“Ah, Anna... Marie...”

<b>

Suzy took Anna Marie's hand...

<b>

“Please... take care of me... Anna Marie.”

“Thank you, my lady. I will take care of you.”

<b>

As Anna Marie squeezed Suzy's hand back with a truly lovely smile,

<b>

Suzy found herself completely charmed.

She had become quite the easy target.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Goodnight, Papa Howard, Mama Sonia.”

<b>

Suzy performed the customary “goodnight kiss” by pressing her cheeks against each of them in turn, then stepped back with a smile.

<b>

This was something Suzy had started doing since becoming their adopted daughter, as requested by Howard and Sonia...

<b>

At first, with the memories of being a Japanese man, she felt a strong resistance to it.

However, when she actually tried it, there was a slight embarrassment, but surprisingly, it became something she could do smoothly.

<b>

I wonder if it’s because of this body? she thought, but now it had completely become a habit, and it felt natural.

In fact, not doing it felt unsettling.

For the past week, the absence of the “goodnight kiss” had left both Suzy and the Cloud couple feeling a sense of loneliness.

<b>

Now, after a week, in this goodnight greeting, the three of them felt a gentle warmth.

<b>

<b>

<b>

During the day, Suzy had been clinging to Sonia from lunchtime until one in the afternoon.

She continued to talk about various trials and tribulations,

as if to say that what they discussed in the carriage on the way back was of no help at all.

Sonia listened to her with a happy expression throughout.

Occasionally, she would ask questions or interject, but she seemed genuinely happy to converse with Suzy.

<b>

After Howard returned, she clung to him as well.

During dinner, the conversation didn’t stop, and Howard nodded along with a smile.

After the meal, she settled down on the long sofa in the living room, nestled between the couple, continuing her chatter.

<b>

Suzy seemed to be trying to stay as close to Howard and Sonia as possible, and the couple’s affectionate and doting feelings were reaching their peak.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Thank you for your hard work today... no, this past week. Let me say it again, Suzy. It’s been a week since you’ve been home. Sleep well.”

“Goodnight, Suzy. We made the bed nice and fluffy for you. Make sure to rest well. Anna Marie, you can come up too. You must be tired from your first day, right? Please take Suzy to her room.”

“Yes, ma’am. Thank you very much, ma’am. Then I will take my leave first, sir.”

<b>

With Anna Marie holding a lamp leading the way, she escorted Suzy to her room.

Suzy felt a bit awkward having Anna Marie do everything, including opening and closing the door, but in the end, she was led to her bed and had the blanket tucked in for her.

<b>

“Goodnight, my lady.”

“Goodnight, Anna Marie... Thank you for today... Ah, and I look forward to tomorrow as well...”

“Yes, I look forward to it too, my lady. Sweet dreams.”

<b>

With that, Anna Marie gently closed the door and left the room.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Ah... my own bed, my own blanket, my own pillow... Mmm! This is it!”

<b>

Snuggling under the covers and hugging her pillow, she murmured happily.

<b>

“Anna Marie... I might accidentally call her ‘-san’ again if I’m not careful... I need to be mindful of that for a while. But really, she’s in training, even though she seems capable of doing everything...”

<b>

Suzy had heard the sound of dishes breaking in the kitchen while preparing lunch and dinner, followed by a sound like a slap, as if someone had been hit on the head with a paper fan, and then muffled groans from Anna Marie.

(Since Elrose is strict... I think Anna Marie makes delicious tea, but maybe she’s not good at kitchen work...)

<b>

Thinking about that, she recalled the image of the Cloud couple enjoying the tea that Anna Marie had brewed with satisfaction.

<b>

“Housemaids don’t usually handle cooking... But for a maid, do they need to be able to do everything? Watching Elrose, it feels like that might be the case... So she really came here for training... It seems tough, but I hope she does her best.”

<b>

She shifted positions in bed, reaffirming the feel of the cotton nightgown against her skin.

<b>

“Mmm, it feels so good... Why is it so comforting to rest in my own home, in my own bed, with my own pillow, and in my own nightgown...?”

<b>

She continued to move around under the covers.

<b>

“Ah, Anna Marie's... massage... it felt... too good... If it becomes an addiction...”

<b>

The feather duvet began to stir and sway. She thought she should be careful since Anna Marie's room was next door... but the movements of the duvet grew larger.

<b>

On the other side of the wall where Suzy's bed was placed was Anna Marie's room.

She knew that Anna Marie had returned to her room immediately after leaving Suzy’s room, changed, and went to bed because of the presence she felt.

Even though it was just a single wall, it was not a thin wall; it was solidly built and thick. Unless there was a very loud noise, sound wouldn’t leak through.

<b>

Understanding this, Suzy buried her face in her pillow to avoid making noise and suppress any sounds that might escape.

<b>

The stirring of the duvet became more intense and quick, and the mattress creaked and shook.

Breath that she was unaware of leaked quietly into the room.

<b>

<b>

****************************************

<b>

<b>

There was a figure listening intently against the wall.

<b>

Under normal circumstances, it would be a sound so faint that it wouldn’t be heard without using magic.

If magic had been used, Suzy would have noticed immediately.

<b>

However, this was purely her physical ability.

For someone with a high-ranking scout class like her, this level of obstacle was as thin as paper.

<b>

“O... my lady...! What a... what a lovely... sound...! It’s... it’s inspiring!! Someday... I will... I will... directly...! My lady!!”

<b>

There was another shadow moving vigorously on the other side of the wall...

<b>

At this moment, no one in the Cloud family noticed that a dangerous presence had settled under the same roof, just on the other side of the wall from Suzy!

<b>

“O... my lady!!!”

<b>

----------------

“...! An enemy? There’s an enemy!”

“What? What’s wrong, Mia?! Is there a magical beast nearby?!”

“No, it’s an enemy! It’s an enemy!!”

“What? It’s not a magical beast?! What is it? What’s there?!!”

“Dangerous! It’s dangerous!”

“What is it?! What is it, Mia?! What’s there?!!”

“Hmm... it’s dangerous... very dangerous!”

“What is it?! What is it?!”

<b>

Next time: “A Forewarning from Dekember”

Is it really okay to start the year with such an erotic story?

I can’t help but think that...

<b>

But I have no regrets whatsoever!!
