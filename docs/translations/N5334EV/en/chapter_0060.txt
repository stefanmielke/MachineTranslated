# 55 The Cloud Family Maid of Honor

Happy New Year!

<blank>

This is the first one in the new year!


----------------

<blank>

Amcam House, also known as "The Palace of the North," currently had 41 housemaids.

<blank>

Its main task is the upkeep of the vast former frontier count's mansion.

It is not uncommon for important people from the outside to visit the castle during harvest festivals and other events. It is one of their important jobs to host the guests.

These girls are expected to always be of a high level of quality as maids.

One day, these girls were shocked.

<blank>

It happened just the other day. The Cloud family was looking for a maid of honor for their daughter.

She is the daughter of the Cloud family...I mean Suzy Cloud.

<blank>

<blank>

More than 150 years had already passed since the aristocracy was abolished.

The aristocracy already does not exist in society.

However, for those who live in Amkam, the Cloud family is still the leader of Amkam, uniting the Protectorate and leading Amkam.

<blank>

For the people of Amkham, the daughter of the Cloud family is, in other words, the "princess" of their lord.

Moreover, Suzy has many admirers because of her ability.

Of course, most of the maids were among them.

<blank>

Many maids of honor came forward for the position of maid of honor.

The selection process was said to be extremely fierce....

But out of such a situation, she, Annemarie Bairos, won the right to take up her position as Suzy's maid of honor.

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I can do it by myself, you know?

It's all right, my lady. Leave everything to me."

No, no, it's not that. Huh? Huh? Huh? Huh?

<blank>

Suzy was dragged to the bathroom and resisted, saying that she could undress by herself and bathe by herself.

<blank>

Ugh? Ew? Yeah?"

<blank>

In the bathroom, where the floor and walls were covered with beautifully decorated tiles, Suzy was now in a pair of shorts on a bath mat used as a foot mat with a vivid geometric pattern in detailed embroidery.

White steam was rising from the other side of the reed screens, threatening to cover the bathroom with a haze.

It is clear that the bathtub on the other side of the impulse is filled with plenty of warm water.

<blank>

In a large basket next to the bath mat, the clothes Suzy has been wearing up until now are piled one after another.

Standing on the mat, I looked into the mirror in front of me and saw my own reflection, wide-eyed in surprise, with two small but well-shaped ridges exposed in all their glory.

I found my face rapidly heating up.

Suzy hurriedly covers her breasts with her hands and turns to AnnaMarie to protest...

<blank>

"Come on, miss. Let's put this one in the basket too."

<blank>

As soon as she said that, AnnaMarie also stripped off the thin cloth that had been Suruzy's last stronghold.

I felt the two piles of flesh on the back side of my body shake as if they were popping.

<blank>

Nyah? Nyaa! Nyaa?

<blank>

Quickly, she moves her right hand forward as well, but then realizes that AnnaMarie's eyes are at the same level as her own at the base of her legs as she crouches down to take down the last sheet, and even though she has not yet gotten into the water, her face is becoming redder as if she is boiling.

<blank>

AnnaMarie is sure to have seen this part of the cloth, but she removes it and puts it in the laundry basket as if nothing had happened.

<blank>

Suzy was so nonchalant about AnnaMarie that she came to her senses for a moment from her petit pani state, hurriedly picked up one of the towels piled in front of her, and covered herself with it.

Since she had picked up a hand towel, she had to cover only the front part of her body with a piece of cloth. The heat in Suzy's boiling face continued to rise without subsiding.

<blank>

Miss, please stay in the hot water.

<blank>

And AnnaMarie came over to talk to Susie, holding the laundry basket.

Apparently, she intends to take the basket to the laundry.

<blank>

Susie moved to the back side of the impulse with her naked body hidden by a hand towel, as if in a state of alertness.

<blank>

I will clean up right away, so please stay in the bathtub, miss."

<blank>

AnnaMarie then took the basket with Suzy's clothes piled in it and left the bathroom at once.

Susie peeked out from behind a screen and stared at AnnaMarie until she left the bathroom, but when she was sure she had left, she let out a deep breath and relaxed her shoulders.

<blank>

Turning his face from facing the bathroom entrance, he sees the familiar white ceramic bathtub of the Claudo family.

In the beautifully curved bathtub, plenty of hot water was waiting for Suzy, filled with steam.

<blank>

I am a little uneasy about AnnaMarie's behavior, but it was a good opportunity to take a bath. I have no choice but to take a bath.

After all, I've spent a week just bathing.　Her body needs a bath!　Susie obeyed her heart's call and put her white legs into the bathtub.

<blank>

As he sinks his body into the hot water, hot water overflowing from the bathtub spills noisily onto the tiled floor.

The sound of spilled hot water hitting the tiles and flowing echoed through the room, and the steam from the hot water spreading across the floor further obscured the view.

<blank>

Nn aaaa～～～～～～n...ahh."

<blank>

I soak in the hot water, and I can't help but let out a voice that sounds like an exhale.

<blank>

"Kimochiiiiiii～～～～nnn"

<blank>

As a former resident of the country of Hinomoto, it is inevitable that one's voice will be heard when immersed in hot water.

The phrase "extreme paradise" comes to mind unintentionally.

<blank>

This feels too good...～～～～～

<blank>

It's the first bath in a week. The comfort of the hot water seems to soak into every part of my body.

Unexpectedly, he stretches his body in the bathtub!　and stretch out.

<blank>

I stretched out wide, not caring that the hot water surged and spilled out of the bathtub. The sound of splashing hot water echoed in the bathroom.

Suddenly, I looked down at my body soaking in the bathtub and saw a shadow the same color as my own head of hair lolling under my lower belly.

I remembered that AnnaMarie had said she would be back soon, and for some reason I felt strangely embarrassed about that.

At any rate, I used a hand towel I had with me and covered my body in the hot water to hide it.

<blank>

（Huh? Huh? I feel like I've become a bit of an "Ero-ish"?)

<blank>

Miss! We have been waiting for you!"

"Aaahyan?

<blank>

AnnaMarie opened the bathroom door at that moment, and I couldn't help but make a funny sound.

It bounced up in the bathtub, splashing and splashing hot water.

<blank>

I'm sorry to keep you waiting, miss. We will take care of you right away."

<blank>

(No...no, I'm not waiting for you.... (No... no, I'm not waiting for you... and I'll take care of you too... ......)

<blank>

Aside from Suzy's heart, AnnaMarie approached the bathtub with her own sleeves rolled up.

Susie thinks with half-open eyes, her face half submerged in the bathtub, bubbling with bubbles.

<blank>

(I wasn't this embarrassed when Elrose washed my body when I first came here.... Why am I so embarrassed to AnnaMarie? Is it because we are close in age? Is it because she is my sister? Anyway, I think my sense of shame is overactive.... Oh, I see... shame? Is it because my sense of shame is growing? At first, my sense of shame was low! I was fine with people looking at my pants! Now my sense of shame is growing! My sense of shame has grown to the point that if Mia sexually harassed me and rolled up my skirt, I would not be able to move on the spot! This means that I'm growing up properly, right? Yes!)

<blank>

Come, my lady, let me wash your hair."

Fugyunyunyu?!"

<blank>

While Suzy was contemplating her shame, AnnaMarie rolled up her sleeves, finished preparing for the bathroom task, and quickly pulled Suzy's head out of the tub and over the edge of the bathtub.

Suzy suddenly grabs my head and makes another funny sound.

<blank>

Oh! Ah! I'm alone..."

I'm sorry, Miss," he said, "but you must be quiet. Close your eyes, my lady, or your eyes will sink in."

<blank>

AnnaMarie puts the shower on Suzy's head, which she tries to resist with or without, and lathers her with shampoo.

<blank>

Please relax and stay comfortable."

<blank>

Saying this, AnnaMarie washed Susie's hair in a gentle, laborious manner.

<blank>

You've been out in the field with your hair for a week, haven't you? I'll take good care of it, just a moment, okay?"

<blank>

(Come to think of it, I haven't taken care of my hair for a week... AnnaMarie's hands feel so good...) I think I'll just leave it to her...)

<blank>

I'm looking forward to working with you...please...take care of me..."

Hi, I'm at your service."

<blank>

From the bathtub lying on her back, AnnaMarie's hands massaging her hair and head on the edge of the tub were more comfortable than expected, and Susie unwittingly surrendered herself to them.

<blank>

Haaaaah ...... mmmm...."

<blank>

The feeling was so good that I even let out a voice that sounded like an exhale.

<blank>

Oh, that AnnaMarie!

<blank>

Suzy was talking to AnnaMarie as if to cover up the embarrassment of the tone of voice she had unintentionally produced.

<blank>

Dear lady, my name is AnnaMarie. You don't need to call me that. Just call me 'AnnaMarie.

But I don't like to call someone who is much older than me..."

<blank>

The young lady is very kind.... But, Mistress, you also call out to Master Elrose, don't you? It is natural for a master to address his squire. I am the squire of the Mistress!

But I still have some resistance. And a squire...I don't have such a high status.

<blank>

Miss..., you don't understand your position.... I understand, and this is my request to you. From now on, as long as you take care of my daughter, please call me 'AnnaMarie'.

What? Oh, please...?"

<blank>

Yes, please. By having Miss Susie address me as "Susie," I can feel the response and the proof that I am serving her. I know it's a very humble request to make of you, Miss, but will you hear me out?"

'Oh, no... you can't be so thick ....... Well, let's see... ...... a, AnnaMary...? I still feel a little uncomfortable..."

Thank you very much, Miss. Please get used to it little by little."

<blank>

As they talked, Susie felt her wariness toward AnnaMarie gradually dissolve.

Well, it was originally an alertness that came from being stripped of her clothes...but AnnaMarie's massage was too comfortable. For Susie, feeling good is justice! For Susie, a good massage is justice.

<blank>

(Naked relationships are very important for people to bond with each other...)

<blank>

I was thinking about it. But it is only Suzy who is naked....

<blank>

Suzy's pleasure quotient rose steadily as she was washed and massaged around her face and neck with cream, starting with the enforcement of the head massage.

Already her shoulders and arms were being massaged and washed, and before she knew it, her body and delicate parts were being washed by AnnaMarie's hands.

<blank>

If that raises some strange voices, that's just the way it is.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

****************************************

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Susie sat in front of the mirror, wrapped in a bath towel, while AnnaMarie blew her hair.

Suzy's cheeks in the mirror are too reddish to be after a bath.

<blank>

(Heh, I made a weird sound, I did...what should I do? ...... Did they think I was weird...or dangerous? But...that place...that way......... AnnaMary's expression hasn't changed and I wonder if she's going through with it? She's so ...... mature.... (ooohhhhh)

<blank>

While Suzy was still moping about the glazed voice she had just made, AnnaMarie's brushing continued.

It feels so good to surrender myself to it... and my consciousness almost melts away.

<blank>

(Oh man...AnnaMarie's massages...I'm going to get addicted to them.... (Oh my God... AnnaMarie's massages... I'm going to get addicted to them...) The brushing feels good too... I really feel like a young lady somewhere... I'm in trouble...)

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy's wet hair eventually dried, and when AnnaMarie tried to get her to put on underwear so that she could get ready, Suzy tried to show her firm refusal, saying that she could do it herself, but again, her resistance was in vain, and she allowed AnnaMarie to put on her underwear by herself.

<blank>

Suzy felt as if she had lost something important, but she could not help but open her eyes to her reflection in the mirror.

<blank>

This... this!"

<blank>

1.5 times more than our company's.

<blank>

Suzy drops her eyes to her chest, looks in the mirror, and looks at AnnaMarie. She repeats it several times....

<blank>

"Oh, wow! I have a valley! ...No, no, I've had valleys before... but not like this...!

<blank>

It is the result of pulling together and raising the bar.

<blank>

People call me a winner!

<blank>

I'm going to win with this!　Susie thought.

It is unclear what they will win.

<blank>

But the original winner is AnnaMarie... Suzy is fascinated by her reflection in the mirror.

She changes her pose in various ways and is more pleased than ever with the assertive white mound on her chest.

<blank>

AnnaMarie was also satisfied as she watched warmly.

<blank>

I'll set you up every day from now on."

<blank>

Susie looks at AnnaMarie as if to say "Hah! Suzy turns her eyes to AnnaMarie as if to say, "What the hell is this?

Then, he stepped forward, holding out his hand....

<blank>

"Oh, Anna-Marie..."

"AnnaMary, my lady."

Oh, Anna... Mary..."

<blank>

Suzy takes AnnaMarie's hand....

<blank>

Nice to meet you... please... AnnaMarie.

"Pleasure to meet you, miss."

<blank>

AnnaMarie answered with a really nice smile while squeezing Suzy's hand back.

<blank>

Thus, Susie was caged.

It's quite a choloine.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Howard Dad, Sonia Mom, good night."

<blank>

Suzy gave them both a "goodnight kiss" in turn, cheek to cheek, as is her custom, and then stepped back and smiled.

<blank>

This is something that Howard and Sonia have been asking me to do since Susie became their adopted daughter....

<blank>

Initially, as a person with memories of Japanese Osan, I was terribly resistant.

However, when I actually tried it, I found it surprisingly easy to do, despite some embarrassment.

<blank>

I wondered if it was my body's effect on me.　I used to wonder if it was my body's influence, but now it has become a habit, and I take it for granted.

I'd rather not, but it's more unsettling not to.

The lack of "goodnight kisses" over the past week has been heartbreaking for both Susie and Mr. and Mrs. Cloud.

<blank>

Now, for the first time in a week, the three of them felt a faint warmth in their goodnight greetings.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

During the day, Suzy is from lunchtime to one in the afternoon.

He stuck close to Sonia and kept talking about this and that during the ordeal.

He went on and on, as if to say that what we had talked about on the carriage ride home didn't add up to anything.

Sonia was happy to hear this from beginning to end.

She occasionally asks a question or makes a comment, but she seems happy, as if she truly enjoys exchanging words with Suzy.

<blank>

When Howard returned, he was clothed as well.

The conversation did not stop during dinner, and Howard nodded and listened happily.

After dinner, I settled down on the long sofa in the living room, sandwiched between the couple, to continue our conversation.

<blank>

The couple's fondness for their children nearly broke through the heavens when Suzy seemed to want to stay away from Howard and Sonia, even if only for a little while.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I just wanted to thank you again for your hard work this past day...well, this past week. Let me say it again, Susie. It's been a week since I've been home. Have a good rest."

Good night Suzy. The beds are all soft and fluffy. Rest well. AnnaMarie, you can go up too. You must be tired after the first day. Will you take Susie back to her room with you?"

Thank you, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. I'll leave you to it, sir."

<blank>

The hallway was preceded by AnnaMarie holding the lamp and taking Susie to her room.

Suzy was a bit nervous about having AnnaMarie open and close the door for her, but eventually she was led to the bed and covered with a comforter.

<blank>

Good night, miss."

Good night, AnnaMary... Well, thank you for today....oh, and I look forward to working with you tomorrow..."

Yes, it's nice to meet you too, Miss. Sweet dreams."

<blank>

With that, AnnaMarie socked the door shut and left the room.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ahh... my bed, my futon, my pillow...! Nmmm...! This is it after all.

<blank>

He pulled the covers over his head and pressed his face grimly against the pillow as he hugged it, muttering happily.

<blank>

AnnaMarie.... The most important thing to remember is that you can't just take a look at the website and say, "I'm not a professional. I'll be careful for a while...but you really are in training, you seem to be able to do everything like that..."

<blank>

Susie heard the sound of dishes breaking in the kitchen while preparing lunch and dinner, followed by a sparring noise that sounded like someone was beating her head with a hurricane, and the muffled moans of AnnaMarie.

(Elrose-san, you are so spartan.... AnnaMarie, I think you make a good cup of tea, but I'm not sure I'm good at kitchen work...)

<blank>

As I think about this, I remember the sight of Mr. and Mrs. Cloud enjoying the tea made by AnnaMarie with a sense of satisfaction.

<blank>

Housemaids are not in charge of cooking or anything like that. But I wonder if a maid of honor has to be able to do everything? I think so when I look at Elrose-san.... I know it sounds like a lot of work, but I wish you the best.

<blank>

Moso moseying around in bed, he changed his posture and once again checked the feel of the cotton nightgown he was wearing.

<blank>

I've never felt so good.... Why does it feel so safe to rest in my own house, in my own bed, on my own pillow, in my own nightgown...?

<blank>

Furthermore, the rustling continues.

<blank>

"Oh, AnnaMary's ...... masseuse ......, she feels ...... too good...you know. That's ...... not good ....... If you get into ...... the habit of doing it, you'll be ...... in trouble."

<blank>

The feather quilt on the floor began to wriggle and shake.　I have to be careful ...... because next door is AnnaMarie's room.　I thought to myself, but the movement of the quilt on which it was draped grew louder.

<blank>

The other side of the wall where Suzy's bed was placed was used as AnnaMarie's room.

I know from the signs that as soon as she left Susie's room, she went back to her room, changed her clothes, and went to bed.

Although it is a single wall, it is not a thin wall; it is solidly built and thick. No sound leaks out unless it is very loud.

<blank>

Suzy, who understands this, buries her face in the pillow and stifles the sound that leaks out, trying not to make any noise.

<blank>

The bedclothes stirred even more violently and quickly, and the bed mat squeaked and shook.

The breath that leaked out unconsciously echoed quietly in the room.

<blank>

<blank>

****************************************

<blank>

<blank>

There is a figure on the bed, facing the wall and listening.

<blank>

The sound is so faint that it would normally be inaudible without the use of magic.

If he had used magic, Susie would have noticed immediately.

<blank>

But this is purely her physical ability.

With her highly ranked class of scouts, this level of obstacle was as good as paper to her.

<blank>

Oh...Miss...! How...how...lovely...your...voice...! Hahahaha...progress! One day...one day...I...I...will...directly...! Miss!

<blank>

Another shadow moving violently across the wall...

<blank>

At this time, none of the Cloud family members were aware that the danger to Susie was now under one roof and behind one wall!

<blank>

Oh... oh, my lady!



<blank>

----------------

"...! Enemy? There's an enemy!

What? What? What's wrong Mia? Is there a hexenbiest nearby?

No, Bibi. He's the enemy! He's the enemy!

What? You're not a hexenbiest? What? What the hell is in there?

That's why they are the enemy! They are very dangerous! Oh, my God!

What? What is it? Mia! What's in there?

Mmmmmm..." It's dangerous... dangerous!"

What the hell? What's in there?

<blank>

Next "Harbinger from DeKembel."

＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿＿

<blank>

Is it okay to start the New Year with such a ludicrous story?

I can't help but think....

<blank>

I have no regrets at all!
