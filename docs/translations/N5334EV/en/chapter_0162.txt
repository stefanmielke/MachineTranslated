# 150 Annie, Take Up Your Sword

Annie noticed that Cordilia had beads of sweat on her forehead.

<blank>

Perhaps bringing a magical beast under control is putting a tremendous strain on Cordillera.

Intuiting that she can't hold it for long, Annie tightens her grip on the sword in her hand.

<blank>

You don't think you've won with that, do you? Don't tell me you think you've won with that? What?

<blank>

Fluke swung the cudgel in his hand horizontally.

<blank>

With the sound of a gust of wind, more magic light than ever before spilled out from the tip of the device! With the sound of the wind breaking, more magical light than ever before spilled from the tip and scattered.

<blank>

The moment Annie sees this, a bad feeling runs down her spine.

Quickly run your eyes to the left and right, looking for something you just felt.

She understands that it is nothing but folly to remove one's line of sight in the face of the enemy, but Annie's senses are telling her that there is something approaching here.

<blank>

The alley is only about 5 meters wide, just wide enough for a small wagon to pass by.

The men in front are on the east side. If you go 10 meters from there, you will come to the end of the road, where the road splits to the left and right, north and south.

Beyond the buildings at the end of the street, there is a dense row of tenement-like buildings. If you go 50 to 60 meters beyond this point, you are already at the edge of the Maguarat River.

<blank>

Behind us, the road still ends after about 10 meters, and this one turns to the right, north, where the road extends.

<blank>

This is a closed alley, no more than 30 meters long from east to west.

And now Annie felt something coming from the rear, this west side.

<blank>

Immediately after feeling it, those guys came into Annie's sight.

Two large dark gray masses.

One ran along the wall of an alleyway extending to the right and appeared from behind.

The other goes over the roof and comes from above.

<blank>

Annie immediately recognized them as two magical beasts.

<blank>

Lady Cordelia!

<blank>

By the time Annie raised a cry, the two magical beasts were already in the sky.

<blank>

It runs at 40 to 50 kilometers per hour and weighs just shy of 100 kilograms.

It's like a small motorcycle crashing into you.

<blank>

Moreover, the beasts are coming with their fangs in their teeth.

<blank>

The fangs, large in comparison to those of a dog, bit sharply into Catherine's flank and into Cordelia's right shoulder, gouging and tearing at the flesh.

<blank>

Their sad voices echoed around the area.

<blank>

"Co-cha-cha-chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!" Co-cha-coa-chaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!"

<blank>

In an instant, the magical beast ripped into my flesh, and the sheer mass of the beast sent me flying and smashed me into the cobblestone pavement. There was no way he could have survived.

<blank>

Annie could only stare in stunned amazement at the two who were being popped and rolling on the cobblestones. Seeing the two of them rolling on the cobblestones in their tragic state, the twins cried out unbearably and called out Cordelia's name.

<blank>

Gahahaha! I'm sorry, man! It's because you think you're so good just because you're Milia! Gahahahahahahaha!

You idiot! That's what happens when you kids lick and fuck! Bimbos like you should just crawl on the ground and keep your men in a good mood! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

<blank>

In contrast, two men are laughing hysterically at the situation.

<blank>

The moment she saw these men, something inside Annie made a mishri sound.

<blank>

The magical beast that Cordelia had been restraining was dizzy and shaking its head, as if its control had been broken by being away from her.

It is as if they are drunk.

<blank>

"Wow, if you leave my hand, your control over the hexenbiest will disappear. ......, Annie ......, get away from here ...... as soon as possible! ....... Take Dan and Nan with you and ...... oh, ...... hey. ......"

<blank>

<blank>

The other two, after playing off Cordilia and Catherine, came back on their heels to aim at the twins. Noticing this, Annie quickly stepped in front of the twins and swung her sword.

<blank>

Small and quick, the tip of his nose, his eyelids, his ears. Raise your chin, and I'll hit you in the throat with my sword, too.

Even if it is not a decisive blow, it is a quick and sure way to hit the spot that will frighten the opponent.

Even though the sword did not cut them, they were still unable to get close enough to Annie's precise strikes, and the magical beasts began to be wary.

<blank>

Dan. Nan. While I'm pulling you down, get out of the bathroom!"

<blank>

Annie wielded her sword and called out to the twins, keeping the magical beasts in check.

<blank>

But, but Kor-chan, Kor-chan and the others...

<blank>

The twins tearfully complain that they are worried about Cordelia and the others and don't want to leave them.

<blank>

Now is the time to defend yourself! Cordelia wouldn't want you two to get hurt here!"

<blank>

"...... Dan, Nan ....... You should run away ...... quickly. ......agh!"

<blank>

Cordilia urges the twins to listen to Annie and get out of there, even though her right shoulder has been ripped open and slammed into the cobblestones and she is in severe pain all over her body.

<blank>

Koacha! Co-tea!

<blank>

The twins, in tears, finally got up to leave Cordilia and head inside the facility.

<blank>

<blank>

Annie was looking around, adjusting her standing position to protect the twins from the magical beasts.

<blank>

The one I saw earlier is still shaking its head. Perhaps control has not yet returned.

The two men are watching the situation from a short distance away, grinning.

<blank>

I can't help but feel a sense of helpless indignation at the sight of them.

<blank>

I'd like to smash that distorted magical expression tool right now, but the distance to them is more than 5 meters.

<blank>

But if I use that technique that Irving taught me!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

If we destroy that thing, we should not be able to control the magical beast.

At the very least, control becomes unstable.

Annie thought again as she looked at the magical beast still shaking its head.

<blank>

That way, at least we can make time to let the twins escape into the facility.

<blank>

But even if we tried to advance to the men, we would surely be blocked by the magical beasts. They would not wait quietly for us.

<blank>

If that's the case, please contact us at ......!

<blank>

But I haven't been able to use it myself yet.

I don't know if it can be done. ......

<blank>

No, I don't! I don't know!

We have to do it. We have to do it now!

Remember. What did Irving say?

<blank>

Grab your target!

Draw a straight line in your head!

Don't think there is such a thing as distance!

I am already there!

<blank>

<blank>

Assault Dash."

It was the first skill Suzy used when she came to this world.

While not inherently offensive, this skill instantly closes the distance to the target, lowering its defense and providing a debuff effect that causes it to be stunned for a short period of time.

<blank>

<blank>

When Suzy taught this to Irving, he understood and digested it as a pure assault technique, and learned it as his own.

<blank>

Although not even debuffed, it was enough to leave Suzy's mouth hanging open as it bounced off every enemy in its path.

<blank>

Irving was teaching Annie this independently absorbed and acquired skill.

<blank>

Even Irving, who taught her, did not expect that Annie would really be able to use it. Of course, neither did Susie.

<blank>

But Annie learned. I've been able to use it.

<blank>

Annie played the two magical beasts that were between her and the target, and in an instant, she was in the pocket of her opponent, and the sword in her hand was driven into the target with all her might.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

The sword struck the center of the cudgel and smashed it with great skill.

It is destroyed from the middle and the whole club is cracked.

The function of manifesting magic is lost from it at the earliest stage.

Fluke was unable to react to the suddenness of the situation, and his mouth and eyes were wide open.

<blank>

<blank>

At the same time, however, the sword in Annie's grip is broken at its root.

In the time that seemed to have stopped, Annie was sure she heard the tip of the fallen sword strike the cobblestones at her feet, making a dry sound.
