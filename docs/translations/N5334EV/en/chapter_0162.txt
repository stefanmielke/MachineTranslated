# Episode 150: Annie, Take Up the Sword

Annie noticed that Cordelia had beads of sweat like pearls on her forehead.

<b>

Controlling the magical beasts was likely placing a tremendous burden on Cordelia.

Instinctively sensing that it couldn't last long, Annie tightened her grip on the sword in her hand.

<b>

"Hey, hey! You don't actually think you've won with that, do you?! Huh?!"

<b>

Fluke swung the club he held horizontally.

<b>

With a sound like a gust of wind, an even greater amount of magical light spilled from its tip than before.

<b>

The moment Annie saw that, an unpleasant sensation ran down her back.

Instinctively, she glanced left and right, searching for whatever she had just felt.

She understood that looking away from the enemy right in front of her was nothing short of foolishness, but her senses were telling her that something was approaching.

<b>

This alley was barely wide enough for a small cart to pass through, roughly 5 meters across.

The men in front were on the east side. If they advanced just 10 meters from there, they would reach a dead end, where the path split to the left and right, north and south.

Beyond that dead end, there were several buildings lined up closely together like row houses. If one went 50 to 60 meters further from here, they would reach the banks of the Maguarat River.

<b>

Behind them, there was also a dead end after about 10 meters, where the path turned right to the north.

<b>

This was a closed alley, not even 30 meters long from east to west.

And Annie was now feeling something coming from the west, behind her.

<b>

Immediately after sensing it, those things entered Annie's field of vision.

Two large, dark gray masses.

One ran along the wall of the alley extending to the right, revealing itself from behind.

The other came from above, over the rooftops.

<b>

Annie quickly realized that they were two magical beasts.

<b>

"Cordelia-sama!!"

<b>

By the time Annie shouted, the two magical beasts were already soaring through the air.

<b>

In terms of speed, they were running at 40 to 50 kilometers per hour, with a mass that could reach 100 kilograms.

A body slam from them would feel like being hit by a small motorcycle.

<b>

Moreover, the magical beasts were coming at them with their fangs bared.

<b>

The large fangs, incomparable to those of a dog, sank sharply into Catherine's side and Cordelia's right shoulder, tearing through flesh.

<b>

The two women's anguished voices echoed around them.

<b>

"Ko-cha, Ko-cha-aaa!!!" "Ko-cha-aaa!!!"

<b>

In an instant, their flesh was torn by the magical beasts, and they were flung away by their mass, crashing onto the cobblestones. There was no way they could remain unharmed.

<b>

Annie could only stare in shock as the two were flung away and rolled on the cobblestones. Seeing the two of them rolling in such a pitiful state, she couldn't help but let out a cry, calling out Cordelia's name.

<b>

"Gahaha! Serves you right! You thought you could get cocky just because you're a Miriara! Gahahahaha!"

"You fools! You brats are getting what you deserve for being so cocky! You little girls should just crawl on the ground and curry favor with the men!! Kuhahaha!"

<b>

In stark contrast, two men were laughing heartily and egging each other on in that situation.

<b>

The moment Annie saw those men, something inside her cracked.

<b>

The magical beasts that Cordelia had been controlling seemed to have lost their restraint now that they were away from her, shaking their heads unsteadily

as if they were drunk.

<b>

"W-When I’m away from them, the control over the magical beasts disappears... Annie... hurry and get away from here... P-Please take Dan and Nan... with you..."

<b>

<b>

After flinging Cordelia and Catherine away, the other two beasts turned around to target the twins. Realizing this, Annie quickly stepped in front of the twins and swung her sword.

<b>

Small, quick strikes to the snouts, eyelids, and ears. If they raised their chins, she would strike at their throats too.

Even if it didn't deal a fatal blow, she aimed to strike quickly and accurately at places to intimidate the opponent.

Even though her sword couldn't cut, the magical beasts found it difficult to approach due to Annie's precise strikes, and they began to grow wary.

<b>

"Dan. Nan. While I draw their attention, you two need to take refuge inside the facility!"

<b>

Annie called out to the twins while fending off the magical beasts with her sword.

<b>

"B-But Ko-cha..." "Ko-cha and the others..."

<b>

The twins, with tears in their voices, pleaded that they were worried about Cordelia and didn't want to leave.

<b>

"Now is the time to protect yourselves! If you two get into danger here, Cordelia-sama wouldn't want that either!"

<b>

"...Dan, Nan... H-Hurry, escape... Agh!"

<b>

Despite the intense pain coursing through her body from her right shoulder being torn and crashing onto the cobblestones, Cordelia urged the twins to listen to Annie and escape quickly.

<b>

"Ko-cha!" "Ko-cha!"

<b>

Finally, the twins, still crying, managed to pull away from Cordelia and stood up to head towards the facility.

<b>

<b>

Annie adjusted her position to shield the twins from the magical beasts while keeping an eye on her surroundings.

<b>

One of the beasts was still shaking its head. It was likely that its control hadn't fully returned yet.

The two men were watching from a short distance away, grinning as they observed the situation.

<b>

Annie felt an overwhelming anger at their presence.

<b>

She wanted nothing more than to smash that twisted magical apparatus right now, but the distance to them was over 5 meters.

<b>

However, if she used that technique she learned from Arvin!

<b>

<b>

<b>

If she destroyed that, she should be able to lose control over the magical beasts.

At the very least, their control would become unstable.

Annie looked at the magical beast still shaking its head and thought anew.

<b>

If she did that, she could at least buy time for the twins to escape into the facility.

<b>

But even if she tried to advance towards the men, she would undoubtedly be blocked by the magical beasts. There was no way those guys would just sit back and wait.

<b>

Then…!

<b>

But she had never used that before.

She didn't know if she could do it...

<b>

No! It's not that she didn't know!

She would do it. She had no choice but to do it now!!

Remember. What did Arvin say?

<b>

Grab the target!

Visualize a straight line!

Don't think about the distance!

You are already there!!

<b>

<b>

"Assault Dash"

It was the skill that Suzy first used when she came to this world.

Originally, it had no attacking power, but it closed the distance to the target in an instant, lowered their defense, and inflicted a short-term stun effect.

<b>

<b>

When Suzy taught this to Arvin, he understood and absorbed it as a pure charge technique, making it his own.

<b>

Even though it didn’t inflict a debuff, the sight of him knocking down every enemy in his path was enough to leave Suzy speechless.

<b>

Arvin had taught this uniquely acquired technique to Annie.

<b>

Arvin never thought that Annie would actually be able to use it. Of course, neither did Suzy.

<b>

But Annie remembered it. She was able to use it.

<b>

Annie knocked aside the two magical beasts that were between her and her target, instantly closing in on her opponent, and struck with all her might at the sword she held.

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

The sword struck the center of the club, shattering it beautifully.

It was destroyed from the very center, and cracks ran throughout the entire club.

The function to manifest magic was already lost from it.

Fluke couldn't react to the sudden event, only widening his mouth and eyes in shock.

<b>

<b>

However, at the same time, the sword that Annie held broke at its base.

In that moment of frozen time, Annie distinctly heard the tip of the fallen sword strike the cobblestones at her feet, making a dry sound.
