# Chapter 195: Unexpected Relationships

"That's why, you see, Kuu Emel-chan really doesn't pass on work very well. That girl takes after her mother and is surprisingly strict."

"Ah... I see."

<b>

While sitting side by side in the driver's seat of the carriage running through the mountains, Alma-san talked about various things.

Morris-sensei, at the moment of departure, spread out inspection tools inside the carriage and seemed to be checking and maintaining them.

<b>

Alma-san, who is currently holding the reins of the 'horse' next to me, seems to be a veteran who has been a member of the Bouncer Association for quite a long time.

I was a bit scared to ask how many years she had been a bouncer.

Once the topic of Kuu Emel-san's mother came up, my instincts warned me that this was a matter I shouldn't inquire about!

<b>

"Well, I know I'm also at fault for choosing my work, right? But it was the association that first told me not to sell myself short, you know?"

"That's a tricky situation, isn't it?"

"Oh, but since I've known the master for a long time, we understand each other well. Thankfully, he understands our circumstances, so it's quite easy for me. Of course, I like the work at the shop too! Everyone is really nice! Right?!"

"Ah, thank you very much?"

<b>

Alma-san's chatter was unending.

Come to think of it, she often talked a lot during breaks at the shop too, didn't she?

But was she always this quick to speak? Oh, is it because I'm the only one here? Is all her chatting energy focused on me?!

<b>

"Alma-neechan! You're talking too much! The princess is getting uncomfortable!"

"Oh my! Morris-chan. I don't think I've talked that much yet? But since it's been a while since I've been Morris-chan's bodyguard, I might be a little excited♪"

"A, Alma, neechan? Morris...chan?"

<b>

Morris-sensei poked her head out of the running carriage window and made a retort to Alma-san, but...

Huh? What? What? What did she just say? Did I mishear? Huh? What does that mean?

<b>

"Oh? Didn't I mention it? I've known Morris-chan since she was this little! She was so cute back then. This time, I'm really excited to be the bodyguard for such a cute Morris-chan!"

"Is that so? Whenever you make that face, there's always something behind it, isn't there?"

"That's not true at all! Oh! Speaking of which, this 'horse' and carriage were made by Marsh-chan, right?!"

"That's right! That's right! That's exactly it! Marsh-chan said it's still a prototype! Its performance is quite insane!!"

"That's amazing, Marsh-chan. You've become able to make things like this, huh?"

"Eh? Huh? M-Morris-sensei? Marsh...chan? What?"

"Eh? Didn't I mention it? Marsh-chan is my cousin's brother!"

"Wh-what?!"

<b>

What in the world is going on?!

An unexpected relationship suddenly revealed! What is that?!

This is a first-time hearing hour, such a connection!

<b>

"Really! Marsh-chan and Morris-chan were both much cuter than they are now!"

"How many decades do you plan to keep calling us cute, neechan?!"

"Umm... about 100 years?"

<b>

The conversation of the long-lived species is amazing...

I believe Marsh-san is in her 90s.

Seiwashi-sensei, who is also an elf, looks about twenty, but her actual age is the same as Nosori-sensei and Morris-sensei, 75 years old.

In contrast, Alma-san feels like she’s in her early 20s...

<b>

...I wonder what Alma-san's actual age is...

<b>

"Is something wrong, Su-chan?"

"No! It's nothing... at all?"

<b>

I know. It's incredibly rude to care about the actual age of someone who is eternally 17.

Yeah, so I won't worry about it. I won't pry.

So please stop that scary smile, Alma-san.

Before I knew it, the clouds had disappeared, and the blue sky was clear, allowing us to see far and wide.

The mountains towering before the high, expansive blue sky stood in gentle undulations.

The mountain range capped with white seemed to stretch endlessly into the distance.

<b>

<b>

Looking at the white smoke rising from the Rohan Volcano in the back left, the Munanotosu County's Coridona Mountain Range stretches like a wall from west to east.

The elevation of the mountain range is about 2,000 meters, with the main peak, Coridona Mountain, being 2,500 meters high.

<b>

Now, our carriage is heading east along the road extending from Magnumtor City, moving toward this Coridona Mountain Range.

The carriage is set to proceed straight along this road and then enter Munanotosu.

The road crosses the eastern mountains of Magnumtor that we can see now, flows over the Maguarat River in the valley, and continues beyond the mountain range ahead.

<b>

The Coridona Mountain Range, which runs like a wall on the north side of Munanotosu County, is said to have once been a long mountain range connected to the Rohan Mountains of Boltosnan County in ancient times.

It is believed that the current valley was formed due to tectonic movements and river erosion thousands of years ago.

<b>

However, in the local folklore, there is a story that when the goddess of Coridona struck the god of Rohan with a three-part split, she split the mountains in between.

The Rohan Mountain is the male god, and Coridona Mountain is the female goddess.

It seems that the goddess of Coridona grew tired of the Rohan Mountain, which would erupt in anger at any moment.

<b>

In ancient society, it is said that gods existed alongside humans in this world.

It may not be surprising if this valley was not a natural phenomenon but was actually created by powerful magic.

<b>

Our destination is a mine located just before the main peak of Coridona Mountain, across the valley where the Maguarat River flows.

The distance from Magnumtor City, where we currently are, to the mine site is said to be approximately 120 kilometers by road.

<b>

<b>

The southern road extending from Dekkenbel, which we traveled this morning, is much more neatly maintained compared to the northern side, so we were able to reach Magnumtor City, about 200 kilometers away, in just about 5 hours.

We departed at 5 AM, an hour before sunrise. The road was likely clear as well.

<b>

<b>

The performance of the 'horse' specially made by Marsh-san is said to be far superior to that of an ordinary one, and the durability of the carriage is also on another level.

It cannot even be compared to the academy's carriage. "If we drive without worrying about anything, we can arrive in an hour and a half!" Morris-sensei said.

...How incredible is that?

What on earth is Marsh-san aiming for?

<b>

Even so, on this road that passes through dangerous mountain paths and along the valley, we are supposed to proceed within a reasonable range. It seems it will still take about 4 to 5 hours to arrive.

It is said that personnel have already started preparation for measurements at the site, but it seems we will only be able to join them at the mine just before sunset.

<b>

As expected, it seems we should proceed safely without rushing on the way.
