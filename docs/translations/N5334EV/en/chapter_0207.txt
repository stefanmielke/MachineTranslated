# 195 An Unexpected Relationship

That's why Cu Emel is so reluctant to give me work. She's a bit like her mother, and she's a bit more uptight than you'd expect.

"Ha ......, I see."

<blank>

Alma told me many stories as we lined up in the coach's chariot that drove us through the mountains.

Dr. Morris seems to be spreading out the inspection equipment in the carriage as soon as it departs, and is performing inspections and maintenance.

<blank>

Alma, who is now holding the reins of "Uma" next to him, is apparently a veteran of the bouncer association who has been a member for a really long time.

I was a little too coy to ask him how long he had been a bouncer.

As soon as Cu Emel's mother was mentioned, my instincts warned me that this was a matter that I should not listen to!

<blank>

'Well, I know it's my own fault for picking the wrong job, okay? But the association was the first one to tell me not to sell cheap, remember?"

It's a difficult place, isn't it?

But I've known Master for a long time, so I know him well. Thankfully, he understands our situation, so it's a lot easier for us. Of course, I love working at the store. Everyone is so nice! Right?

Thank you very much.

<blank>

I can't stop talking about Alma.

Come to think of it, did we talk a lot during breaks at the store?

But was he such a rapid-fire talker? Oh, is it because I am the only one now? Is it because I am the only one with the power to talk?

<blank>

Alma, you talk too much! You talk too much in a hurry! You're upsetting the princess!"

Well! Morris-chan. Sister, I don't think you've talked that much yet. But it's been a while since I've escorted Morris-chan, so maybe I'm a little agitatedâ™ª"

'A, Alma, sis? Morris, ......-chan?"

<blank>

Dr. Morris stuck his head out of the window of a running carriage and came over to give Mr. Alma a tweak, but .............

What? What? What? What did you say? Did I mishear you? What? What do you mean?

<blank>

What?" Didn't I tell you? I've known you since you were this tiny. You were so cute back then. This time, I'm really excited to be working as a guard for such a cute little Morris!

"Isn't that so? Whenever you made a face like that in the past, there was always something behind it, wasn't there?"

"Oh, no, you don't, do you? Oh! Oh, by the way, this "horse" and carriage! I heard it was Marsh's creation!

Yes! Yes! That's right! Marsh, you said it was still a prototype! It's got some pretty crazy performance!

You're amazing, Marsh. You've learned how to make things like this.

What? Huh? Morris, Dr. Morris? Marsh ...... girl? What?"

"Hmm? Didn't I tell you? Marsh is my cousin's brother!"

"Arrrrrrrrrrr!"

<blank>

What a surprise!

Unexpected relationships suddenly revealed! What is that?

I've never heard of such a connection before!

<blank>

I was so cute! Marshy and Morris were so much cuter than they are now!"

How long do you think you're going to be calling us pretty for?

"What about the 'n----...... hundred years or so?"

<blank>

Long-lived species conversation sugee. ......

I believe Mr. Marsh was in his 90s.

The same elf, Dr. Seiwasi, looks about 20 years old, but his actual age is 75, the same as Dr. Nosoli and Dr. Morris.

Alma, on the other hand, is more like an older sister in her early 20s. ......

<blank>

What the heck is Alma's real age at ............?

<blank>

What's wrong? Sue?"

No, I don't have anything on ! Nothing ......, okay?"

<blank>

I know. I know that it's tactless to worry about the real age of a person who is eternally 17 years old.

Yeah, so don't worry about it. Don't probe.

So please stop that coy smile, Alma.

The blue sky, which had somehow lost its clouds, was so clear and high that one could see far and wide.

The mountains rising in front of the high blue sky stand in a line of gentle undulations.

A series of mountains covered with white stuff on their tops were overlapping each other in layers.

The figure with its white shades seems to go on for miles.

<blank>

<blank>

The Corridona mountain range in Munanotos County stretches from west to east like a wall on the north side, with the Rohan volcano rising in white smoke at the far left.

The mountain range is about 2,000 meters above sea level. The main peak, Mt. Coridona, is said to be 2,500 meters high.

<blank>

Our carriage is now proceeding eastward on the road that extends from the city of Magnumtor toward this Corridona mountain range.

The carriage will continue straight down this street and will enter Munanotos directly.

The road crosses the mountains east of the now visible Magnumtor, crosses the Magualat River flowing through the valley, and continues beyond the mountain range that lies beyond it.

<blank>

The Coridona mountain range, which runs along the northern side of Munanotos County like a wall, is said to have been a long chain of peaks that was once a part of the Rohan Mountains in Boltusunan County.

It is believed that crustal movement and erosion by large rivers tens of thousands of years ago created the valley as it is today.

<blank>

But in a local fairy tale, it is said that the goddess Coridona smashed the mountain range in between when she slapped the male god of Rohan with a three-and-a-half-stroke.

Mt. Rohan is the male goddess and Mt. Corydona is the female goddess.

The goddess of Corydona was disgusted by this mountain of Rohan, which immediately became angry and started to breathe fire.

<blank>

In ancient societies, God was with man in this world.

It would be no surprise if this canyon is not a natural phenomenon, but was actually created by a powerful magic.

<blank>

Our destination was a mine located far beyond the valley through which the Magualat River flows, just before Coridona, the main peak of this mountain range.

He said the distance from the city of Magnumtor, where he is now, to the mine site is about 120 kilometers by road.

<blank>

<blank>

The southern road from De Kembel, which we took this morning, is much better maintained than the northern one, and it took us only about five hours to reach Magnumtor City, which is about 200 kilometers away.

We left at 5 am, still an hour before sunrise. I suppose it was partly because the streets were empty.

<blank>

The performance of Mr. Marsh's special "Uma" that he is currently riding has a different horsepower than the average horse, and the durability of the carriage is also an order of magnitude higher.

It's nothing compared to the school's horse-drawn carriages. If you fly as fast as you can, you can get there in an hour and a half! said Dr. Morris.

...... How much?

Where exactly is Mr. Marsh aiming for?

<blank>

Still, they were to go as far as they could, as the road passes through treacherous mountainous terrain and canyons. It would still take four to five hours to reach the destination.

I heard that workers are already preparing to take measurements at the site, but it will probably be just before the sun sets when I will be able to join them at the mine.

<blank>

I guess we should be in a hurry and be safe on the road! I guess that's what I'm saying.
