Standing is important. People think they are standing normally, but they are not.

What? But doesn't that mean you're still standing?"

The very nature of the state itself changes depending on whether or not it is axed."

You know what I mean? The 'one-track mind' thing? Like, "I'm going to be a person with a strong, thick core?"

Well, the question is how that core should be. ......, you can't imagine a thick, hard core or anything like that, can you?"

What?" Doesn't that look stronger? Doesn't it look like the harder one won't break as easily?"

It's no good if it looks like it's going to break. Stronger, thinner, more supple, longer.

Long?

It's an image of a single connection from the center of the earth to the center of the heavens through me."

I can't imagine that! I can't even picture that!"

It depends on how clearly you can visualize the quality of the image! Good luck!"

I can't even tell how far away the center of the earth is, let alone the center of the universe!"

The longer and deeper you can visualize, the more clearly you can pass the silver ki through your axis. When that axis is firmly in place, nothing half-heartedly evil can come near you.

You're a hermit, aren't you? That's it!

Well, even if you can't go that far, I think it's important to know how you stand through the earth and Ki, don't you?"

Standing up, huh?"

It's a little different, but it also makes you aware of where you stand. I think you are beginning to realize where you stand now, aren't you?"

"Now... where do you stand... hey... hey? Can I ask you something?"

What is it? Again."

I've always wondered... are you really a junior?"

'Oh no, I'm me, okay? I'm definitely the junior of the senior of the senior of the senior of the senior of the senior of the senior. Even at ......."

But?"

But you... you're not like your seniors."

<blank>

Because I am me! Because I am me!

<blank>

I thrust my hands upward from the bed and gave him my best shot.

<blank>

I stretched and got out of bed, opened the window, and breathed in the morning air!　I stretched and got out of bed, opened the window and breathed in a lungful of morning air.

Oooh! I've never had such a pleasant awakening!

<blank>

<blank>

The mornings in early autumn are somewhat chilly, but the clear air is very pleasant.

When I returned from my run as usual, Howard Papa was still working out as usual.

With the other one.

<blank>

Will has decided to practice swordsmanship with Papa Howard every morning from now on.

He said that he had been training properly when he was here...but now, more than ever, he feels differently about his commitment to the sword.

He was still being mentored by Howard Papa and sweating with him.

<blank>

Mr. Howard was also happily practicing his sword as if he and his son were raising it together....

Don't tell me that made you a little jealous, though!

Still! My role of handing the towel to Papa Howard at the end of the workout is still alive and well!

<blank>

...but....

For some reason, before I knew it, Colin was next to me, handing Will a towel!

Why are you here, Colin? Why are you here, Colin?

<blank>

Is it somehow more mandarin duck-like?

Colin and Will also take breakfast together, and there is a great sense that both Howard's dad and Sonia's mom are looking after them in a heartwarming way.

Nuh? When did something happen?

<blank>

I feel like if I go to school, somehow Bibi and Irving are getting closer to each other.

NANICOLE?

<blank>

What's going on? What's going on in there? What's going on in Koch? Are they going to explode?

The hand that grabs the depraved meat is unintentionally strong!



Hiinyuuhuunyuuunyuu! That! That place! That place is no good! Nyuunnnnggg!

<blank>

Nowadays, Mia sometimes does a very dangerous Nagyuu (a kind of Japanese word meaning "a dangerous choo-choo") and goes to ..........

<blank>

<blank>

To get back on track, please visit .......

Currently, the school is in need of a lot of repairs, but it's not that they can't learn.

However, the training center is completely unusable, so they had to re-build it from scratch.

It seems that standing meetings will be outside for a while.

<blank>

Still, the classrooms are filled with the voices of children, as usual.

After all that happened, everyone is already normal.

The quintessential Amcam children! I guess that's what I'm saying?

We learned this time that the villagers of Amkam are really a fighting people.

<blank>

Once inside the classroom, everyone greeted me with joy.

Helena greets Mary happily.

Layla and Mabel also jumped on board.

Furthermore, this one crept up on me as usual, so I popped it on the forehead with a "friendly finger".

Stefan, who had been played off, returned a shy smile as he rubbed his forehead.

So, Alan is still going to go to the back?

Their smiles make me happy.

My cheeks naturally broke into a smile.

<blank>

<blank>

After entering the classroom, I told Bibi that I think I understood what Algernon said the other day....

<blank>

Algernon wants to tell you, and you want to tell me! "Algernon wants to tell you, and you are opening your heart to me...! I think you understand.

<blank>

For some reason, he told me, his eyes swimming and his cheeks tinted.

<blank>

Oh! Also, the other day! I've scolded him! I scolded him!

<blank>

Hmm? Annoying? What is it?

<blank>

And! And! That, that kind of lending..! I don't do that! That's... that's not what I mean! You... do... your... own... thing."

<blank>

What? Renting it out? Is that what you mean? By yourself?

Bear child turned red, and towards the end, she spoke in a whisper that was not like this child, as if she were fading away.

Hmm?

<blank>

Sh! My best friend! I'm not going to blabber ...... about those hobbies! Oh, don't worry!"

<blank>

Huh? A hobby?

Bearko is looking at my chest with her upper eyes while turning over with a bright red face.... Especially around the tip?

...Ah! The thought came to me and I held my chest!

<blank>

Algernon is Bibi's follower.

The two (?) are connected at heart.

If the channels are connected, Bibi can perceive what Algernon sees and feels. In other words, .......

<blank>

I can see his face turning red as he holds his chest.

In other words! I mean..! It means that Bibi knew about my perversion... ～～～～～ Aaaaahhhh...!

<blank>

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! Not... not..! No!

<blank>

He held his chest and appealed to Bibi, red to the neck.

You can see that he has a lot of heat from the chest up!

Bibi said, "It's okay." He was blushing, but he wouldn't look at me.

As I was flailing about, I felt a presence approaching behind me.

It gradually embraced me from behind and .......

<blank>

'Sue-chan...are you playing some kind of prank on me?'

<blank>

He whispered to me as he breathed into my ear!

<blank>

Mneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

I sounded weird with all my might!

Mia, Mia! Oh, my God! Why did you come back?

Colin was on the other side of the room, saying with a look of dismay, "You should moderate your behavior.

Colin doesn't get it! She's doing more than just moderation!

If it weren't so public, that's exactly what it would be...!

Dana is giggling. Bibi cowered and shook his head as if he had given up too!

<blank>

I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

My embarrassing voice echoed through the classroom.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Everyone at school is in high spirits, as usual.

<blank>

Ms. Daisy, showing no signs of fatigue, also participated in cleaning up the school building with the villagers.

At the temple where we stopped by on our way home from school, Dr. Henry was busily taking the lead in treating those who had been injured.

There was no trace of the pained look on his face that he showed us yesterday.

<blank>

As I was leaving the temple, I saw a rider coming out of the back.

The wrinkles between her eyebrows that had been there for a long time disappeared, and she looked very peaceful.

<blank>

<blank>

When I returned home, Gilberto was the first to welcome me home, as he always does.

If you enter the house, you will also find Mr. Elrose.

And of course, Sonia Mama's smile greets me, and Howard Papa's smile greets me.

<blank>

<blank>

I don't know where the God of this world is, but the village of Amkamu and the Cloud family are still without incident today! It's just the way it is.
