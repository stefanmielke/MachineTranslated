"Standing is important. Everyone thinks they are standing normally, but they are not."

"Huh? But isn't it still standing?"

"The essence of the state changes depending on whether the axis is aligned or not."

"Isn't that like 'keeping a straight line'? Like becoming a person with a solid core?"

"Well, the way that core exists is the problem... You shouldn't imagine it as thick and hard, okay?"

"Huh? Doesn't that sound stronger? It seems like a harder one wouldn't break easily?"

"If it breaks, that's no good. Stronger, thinner, more flexible, and longer."

"Longer?"

"An image of being connected from the center of the earth to the center of the heavens through yourself."

"Wow, cosmic scale?! I can't even imagine that!"

"The quality changes depending on how clearly you can visualize it! So do your best!"

"I can't even grasp the distance to the center of the earth, let alone the center of the universe!"

"However, the clearer your image can be, the more you can channel the silver energy through your axis. If that axis is firmly established, no half-hearted evil can approach you."

"That's... like the realm of a sage, right?!"

"Well, even if you can't reach that level, I think it's important to know your way of standing by channeling the earth and energy."

"Way of standing, huh."

"It's a bit of a different topic, but you can also become aware of your position. Don't you think you're starting to realize your current position, senpai?"

"Current... position... Hey, can I ask you something?"

"What is it? So formally."

"I've been thinking for a while... Are you really a junior?"

"Come on, I'm me, right? Without a doubt, I'm your junior... But..."

"...But?"

"But you're... different from the seniors."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Because! I am me!!"

<b>

I shot my hands up from the bed and declared it with all my might.

<b>

Then I stretched and got out of bed, opening the window and inhaling the morning air deeply.

Yes! It was an incredibly refreshing awakening like never before!

<b>

<b>

The autumn morning is somewhat chilly, but the clear air feels very nice.

After returning from my usual run, I found Howard Papa training as usual.

With another person.

<b>

Will seems to have decided to train with Howard Papa every morning from now on.

He said he had been training properly when he was here before, but... now, his attitude towards the sword is different from before.

Even now, he was sweating together under Howard Papa's guidance.

<b>

Howard was happily training as if he were elevating his swordsmanship with his son...

It's a little secret that I felt a bit jealous of that!

Still! My role of handing a towel to Howard Papa after training is still intact!

<b>

...But.

For some reason, Colin had somehow started handing towels to Will next to him!

Why?!! Why is Colin here?!

<b>

Does it feel like their couple-like vibe has increased?

Howard Papa and Sonia Mama seem to be watching Colin and Will with a warm feeling.

Hmm? Did something happen without me noticing?

<b>

When I went to school, it felt like the distance between Vivi and Arvin had somehow gotten closer.

What is this?

<b>

What's going on? Did something happen over there too? Is it going to explode?

I couldn't help but grip the meat in my hand tightly!

Mia was saying something, but I ignored her and started flailing my arms... only to be counterattacked!!

Hii nyuhuhuh! Th-that's! N-no, that's a bad spot!! Nyuannn!!!

<b>

Lately, Mia has been doing some very dangerous counterattacks...

<b>

<b>

Regaining my composure...

Currently, the school needs quite a bit of repair, but that doesn't mean we can't study.

However, it seems the training area is completely unusable, so it will need to be rebuilt from scratch.

It looks like we will have to hold matches outside for a while.

<b>

Even so, the classroom is overflowing with the voices of children as usual.

Despite what happened, everyone is already back to normal.

As expected of the children of Amukamu! I guess that's what it is?

I really understood this time that the villagers of Amukamu are true warriors.

<b>

When I entered the classroom, everyone welcomed me with happy faces.

Helena and Mary greeted me cheerfully.

Layla and Mabel jumped on me.

Furthermore, as usual, they crept up on me, so I flicked them on the forehead with my "Friendly Finger."

Stefan, who was flicked away, rubbed his forehead and returned a shy smile.

And Alan, as expected, went around to the back, huh?

These children's smiles truly make me happy.

My cheeks naturally broke into a smile.

<b>

<b>

After entering the classroom, I told Vivi that I thought I understood what Algernon meant the other day...

<b>

"Algernon wanted to convey something to you, and you also... opened your heart to me...! That's why I think you understood!"

<b>

For some reason, she said this while her eyes were swimming and her cheeks were flushed.

<b>

"Oh! And the other day! That kid seemed to have caused some trouble, so I properly scolded them!!"

<b>

Huh? Trouble? What is it?

<b>

"Y-yeah! And!! That kind of lending...! Isn't happening! So... that kind of thing... do it yourself... okay?"

<b>

Huh? Lending? Is that what it is? By myself...?

Bear-chan was blushing bright red, and by the end, she was talking in a small voice, almost disappearing.

Huh?

<b>

"I-I have no intention of blabbing about my best friend's... such hobbies! So, don't worry!"

<b>

Huh? Hobbies?

Bear-chan was looking up at my chest with a bright red face... especially around the tip?

...Ah!!! I involuntarily realized and covered my chest!

<b>

Algernon is Vivi's familiar.

The two (or?) are connected at heart.

If they connect their channels, Vivi can perceive what Algernon sees and feels. In other words...

<b>

I could feel my face turning bright red while covering my chest.

In other words! My embarrassing behavior was completely transparent to Vivi~~!!! Ahh ahh ahhh!

<b>

"N-no! That's not it! I-I didn't...!"

<b>

I pressed my chest and pleaded with Vivi, my face completely flushed!

I could feel the heat rising from my chest!

Vivi, while also blushing, wouldn't meet my gaze and said it was okay.

As I was flustered, I sensed someone approaching from behind.

That person gently hugged me from behind...

<b>

"Suu-chan... are you up to something?"

<b>

And whispered in my ear!

<b>

"Fuhnyauu nyan!!"

<b>

A weird voice escaped from me!

M-Mia! What are you doing?! Why are you here again?!

Colin over there said with an exasperated face, "Take it easy."

Colin doesn't understand! This girl is doing things that can't be taken easy!?

If there were no people around...!

Dana was laughing heartily. Vivi shrugged her shoulders as if she had given up!

<b>

"Nyahhh Aaaahhh!!"

<b>

My embarrassing voice echoed throughout the classroom.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Everyone at school is as lively as usual.

<b>

Teacher Daisy is also participating in cleaning the school building with the villagers without showing any signs of fatigue.

At the temple I stopped by on the way home from school, Teacher Henry was busy treating the injured, taking the lead.

There was no trace of the painful shadow he showed yesterday on his face.

<b>

When I was leaving the temple, I saw Rider coming out from the back.

The wrinkles that had been there on his forehead disappeared, and he looked very calm.

<b>

<b>

When I got home, as usual, Gilberto was the first to greet me.

When I entered the house, Elrose was there too.

And of course, Sonia Mama's smile and Howard Papa's grin welcomed me.

<b>

<b>

I don't know where the gods of this world are, but the village of Amukamu and the Cloud family are doing just fine today!
