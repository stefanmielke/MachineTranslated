# Chapter 201: Karen and Cordelia

Thank you for waiting! <(_ _)>

----------------

<b>

The shadow taking the shape of a person is cloaked in the loathsome filth of sludge, distorting its mouth as it spills words.

<b>

“...Once, I joined hands with a friend with whom I had a falling out, and we reaffirmed our friendship. How moving! Something hot has welled up in my parched heart!”

<b>

With theatrical movements, it seems to want to say it is overwhelmed, pressing a hand to its chest, but looking at its eyes, which look down on others, one quickly understands that it is merely a sarcastic contempt.

<b>

“Van Niven!!”

<b>

“Can you no longer call me ‘big brother’? How lonely that is, Karen?”

<b>

Once again, Karen raises her voice in caution with a sharp tone.

There is not a trace of the former timidity in her demeanor.

Seeing this, Van slightly squints his eyes.

However, he immediately opens them wide in a theatrical manner, placing a hand to his eyes as if to express sadness.

<b>

“...But, well, that’s fine.”

<b>

Facing the unclean being, Karen steps forward to protect Cordelia.

However, she does not take her gaze off Van Niven at all, quietly moving forward as if ready to act at any moment.

<b>

Van watches Karen’s movements with amusement, twisting the corners of his mouth as if trying to suppress laughter.

<b>

“You don’t need to be so wary. I’m here today to finalize things.”

<b>

“...Finalize? What on earth are you plotting this time?!”

<b>

“Plotting?!”

<b>

Van opens his eyes wide in genuine surprise.

<b>

“What a terrible thing to say! What could I possibly be plotting? Have I ever schemed anything against you until now?!”

<b>

He places a hand on his chest, furrowing his brow as if to say he is hurt.

<b>

“Every word that comes from your mouth is utterly untrustworthy!”

<b>

Hearing Karen’s words, Van covers his mouth with his hand as if he can no longer bear it.

<b>

“Good! Very good, Karen! That is your true self! Those brave, spirited, and justice-filled eyes! Truly wonderful!”

<b>

While hiding his face with his hand, Van shakes his shoulders slightly as if enduring something.

<b>

“However! The thought that that face will once again be crushed and painted over with despair and sorrow... makes me all the more tempted!!”

<b>

What is revealed when he removes his hand is a face filled only with malicious joy.

The corners of Van's mouth rise wickedly, grotesquely.

The white teeth visible from his mouth resemble sharp fangs of a carnivore, instilling terror deep within the hearts of those who see them.

<b>

“Don’t mess with me!”

<b>

But Cordelia, undaunted by that loathsome opponent, charged at him.

Her body heated with anger at Van’s words.

After all, the situation Karen had been in until now was orchestrated by the man before them!

This man is the root of all evil!

He took away Karen’s parents and subjected her to unfounded cruelty; it was all part of his scheme!

And yet, how dare he say he has not plotted anything?!

<b>

To top it all off, he is now claiming he will bring further despair to Karen!

How far does this man intend to toy with Karen?!

Suppressing her fear, Cordelia is driven by the anger rising from the depths of her being.

<b>

“How far do you intend to degrade Karen?!”

<b>

“Degrade? What are you talking about? I am praising her! Only such a person is worthy of a tribute!”

<b>

“A tribute...? What do you intend to do with Karen?!”

<b>

Just as Cordelia raised her voice sharply, a heavy sound like metal clashing echoed from afar.

The vibrations reached the high ground where they stood, causing the ground beneath them to tremble slightly.

<b>

“What, what is that?!”

“What is this sound? Could it be?!”

<b>

Karen stretched out her arm in front of Cordelia in a protective manner, but Cordelia spoke up as if realizing something.

<b>

“It’s the sound of a physical barrier being erected. It seems the barrier device has been activated.”

<b>

Karen and Cordelia placed their hands on the railing of the observation deck and looked down at the glowing barrier device.

The faint light began to shine brighter and brighter, and the pillars supporting the lanterns rose higher.

Then, thick walls began to rise one after another between the stone pillars, which were the barrier devices.

<b>

This large vibration is the sound resonating around as those thick walls rise.

<b>

“C-Cordelia, this is...”

<b>

“Something is likely approaching from deep within the forest. Don’t you feel an unpleasant presence coming from there?”

<b>

As they watched the thick walls rise one after another, Karen and Cordelia sensed ominous movements beyond them.

<b>

“Though it’s reduced by more than thirty percent due to the incompetence of the lowly carrion eaters... it should still be enough to ravage this place.”

<b>

Van muttered behind them, furrowing his brow in displeasure.

But then he dramatically spread his arms and placed a hand on his chest, bowing elegantly.

<b>

“Well then, let’s prepare for the feast.”

<b>

“Don’t tell me! You orchestrated this?!”

<b>

“Rest assured, Karen. After this, I will take the time to pluck your two lovely buds.”

<b>

As Van spoke, his eyes glimmered with an inhuman light, and his mouth curled even wider.

A sound like air escaping escaped from his throat, and he let out a chuckle.

<b>

In that moment, Karen’s fist sliced through the air.

<b>

The magical seals engraved on Karen’s magical armor glowed faintly, and in an instant, she closed the distance, delivering a strike infused with “ki” toward Van.

<b>

Van instantly caught the punch with just his right hand, but his fingers were crushed, and blood spurted out.

Without hesitation, Karen followed up with a left roundhouse kick. However, Van smoothly stepped back to evade it.

<b>

“This is wonderful. If I were to take that head-on, it seems I wouldn’t come out unscathed.”

<b>

Van opened his eyes in surprise, raising his right hand in front of his face. But there were already no wounds on that hand.

<b>

<b>

“I won’t let you lay a hand on those kids!”

<b>

With a fiery rage in her eyes, Karen glared at Van.

<b>

“Don’t worry, I have proper opponents prepared for you.”

<b>

But in response, Van coolly replied and snapped his fingers.

Then, from the shadow behind Van, something resembling a human figure emerged.

<b>

“I believe you’ll recognize this one...”

<b>

From the depths of the shadow emerged a large figure.

However, its size was far too great.

And its silhouette was strangely distorted.

Eventually, its head appeared from the shadow, illuminated by the light of the observation deck.

<b>

“Rodrigo... no, I believe it was Fluke...?”

<b>

This was the person they had encountered in front of the children’s facility not long ago.

Karen had called him Rodrigo at the time, but later learned from the director that his true name was Fluke.

<b>

However, that man had been captured in the Dekkenberg Defense Organization’s facility and had gone missing during the recent undead incident.

Why is he here?!

<b>

Moreover, the man’s appearance was somewhat strange.

His eyes were vacant, and it was unclear where he was looking. His mouth opened and closed as if he were a fish out of water.

And had that man been this tall?

He was undoubtedly much larger than the half-giants occasionally seen in town.

His body’s silhouette was also odd.

It wasn’t clear since he was not illuminated, but it looked as if he were wearing a distorted costume.

<b>

“This is the harvest from the other day. I believe it has matured quite well.”

<b>

As Van said this, he took a step back.

Shadows swirled around his body.

<b>

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

<b>

As Van began to disappear, Karen kicked the ground to close the distance once more.

But just before she could reach him, Fluke swiftly slipped in between them.

Caught off guard by his impossible reaction speed, Karen instinctively turned away.

A fist that had been swung down from above shattered the ground where Karen had just been standing.

<b>

“‘?!’”

<b>

Karen and Cordelia gasped at the sight of Fluke illuminated by the light.

What stood there was something resembling a human form.

<b>

Two fists were embedded in the ground.

They were arms that had merged into one from two shoulders.

The same was true for the legs. Two legs had also merged into one.

He wore ragged clothing resembling a shirt and pants, but from the bulge of that shirt, it appeared there might still be an arm around his side.

And beneath Fluke’s face, another face was attached near his shoulder.

<b>

“?! W-Wait! Parker?!”

<b>

That was the face of Parker, who had attacked Karen and the others alongside Fluke at that time.

His eyes were also vacant, and it was unclear where he was looking. His mouth moved as if he were breathing.

However, the way his mouth moved lacked the naturalness of a living being, sending chills down Karen’s spine.

Karen was at a loss for words at the sight of the familiar figure in such a state.

<b>

“There’s no need to worry. I’ve removed the yoke of ‘human’ from him. He is no longer a being that can be confined by such a thing. I take pride in this creation of mine.”

<b>

It was a grotesque and loathsome aberration.

It was as if multiple dismembered dolls had been combined and mixed together, a grotesque and tasteless failure of a doll play.

This was an unnatural body created from human flesh.

Van spoke of this blasphemous existence as if he were proud of his handiwork.

<b>

“What do you think you’re doing to people... to humans?!”

<b>

“Humans? They are truly insignificant beings. Their existence only gains meaning when they can serve our purpose. How fortunate they are.”

<b>

Cordelia, unable to suppress her nausea at such actions, raised her voice, denouncing the violation of human dignity.

However, such protests did not reach Van even to the extent of a mustard seed.

<b>

“Well then, I must go pay a little visit of gratitude. For a while, please entertain this in my stead.”

<b>

With that, Van placed a hand on his side and turned his gaze toward the barrier device glowing blue below.

Then he began to disappear into the darkness.

<b>

“W-Wait! You won’t get away—?!”

<b>

As Van melted into the darkness, Karen closed the distance in an instant.

But just before she could reach him, a gust of wind rushed in from the side.

<b>

A powerful arm flew toward Karen in a large arc.

Though it was a wide swing, its speed was extraordinary. Karen instinctively changed her trajectory to distance herself from the massive arm.

Moreover, unbelievably, the flying arm split into two midway.

One fist passed through the space where Karen had just been, while the other embedded itself in the ground where she had been standing.

<b>

“Cordelia! I’ll draw its attention! You escape now!”

<b>

“Old tree, sing in the wind. Play the song of joy, the song of victory, and dance together...”

<b>

“Cordelia?”

<b>

『Battle spirit rising!』

<b>

In response to Karen’s shout to escape, Cordelia began to chant her battle song.

The battle song raised Karen’s combat power.

Her reaction speed increased, and both her defense and attack power surged, overflowing with magical energy.

<b>

“I won’t leave you behind! No matter what! Absolutely!!”

<b>

“Cordelia...”

<b>

“I swear I won’t let Karen be alone! ...I will protect you!”

<b>

A massive left hand was swung.

Though it was a large arc, a tremendous speed hook flew toward Karen. With “Air Flow Acceleration,” the magic Cordelia cast created a layer of air around Karen’s arms.

As the enormous arm approached at high speed, it made contact with the rapidly rotating layer of air around Karen’s arm, slightly deflecting it and altering its trajectory.

Using the force of the deflected arm, Karen flowed with it, and the massive body, dragged by the arm, lost its balance and fell.

<b>

“I believe in Karen. So, Karen! Please... believe in me!”

<b>

Even if the opponent had fallen, it didn’t seem like any damage had been dealt.

Karen stepped lightly, gauging the distance.

At the same time, she was genuinely astonished by Cordelia’s supportive magic.

“This is so much easier to fight!”

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Sturgeon. You go to your friend.”

<b>

Cordelia called out to her familiar.

A small white fluffball that had run from somewhere climbed up to Cordelia’s shoulder in an instant. Its nose twitched as it made squeaky sounds, as if asking, “What’s going on?”

<b>

“And tell your master that the monsters are coming here.”

<b>

Surely they would handle it well. They would break through this situation... that monster. “Tell Catherine and Lucille to evacuate quickly.” She conveyed that too.

<b>

“So, here, Karen and I will hold on!”

<b>

Karen clenched her fists and shadow-boxed to the left and right.

Her body moved with an unexpected sharpness.

Turning to Cordelia, she nodded with a strong gaze.

<b>

“Got it, Cordelia. I’m counting on you!”

<b>

“Leave it to me!”

<b>

With a bright smile, Karen threw strong words at Cordelia.

In return, Cordelia smiled happily back at Karen.

<b>

In the next moment, Karen ran.

She infused her magical armor with magical power to crush the aberrant monster.

Wearing the wind magic filled with Cordelia’s heartfelt trust more than anyone else in this world.

To deliver a full-powered strike against the aberration.
