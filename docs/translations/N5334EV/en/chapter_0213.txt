# 201 Karen and Cody

Thank you for your patience! <(_ _)>


----------------

<blank>

The shadow that takes the form of a human being wears a sludge-like fearlessness about its body, and its mouth is twisted into a crooked line as it speaks.

<blank>

......To see friends who have fallen out of love and then to see them reunited again, it's truly touching! It's really moving! It made my parched heart hot!

<blank>

With a theatrical movement, he presses his hand to his chest, as if to say he is moved to tears, but when you look at the condescending look in his eyes, you immediately understand that it is just a sarcastic insult.

<blank>

Van Niven!!!!"

<blank>

I'm sorry you can't call me your brother anymore? ...... will miss you, Karen?"

<blank>

Once again, Karen's voice is sharp and alert.

There is not the slightest hint of her former timid demeanor in her voice.

Van's eyes narrow slightly at the sight.

Immediately, however, he opened his eyes with a theatrical movement and put his hand over them as if to say he was sad.

<blank>

It's ......, but that's okay."

<blank>

Facing the unholy thing, Karen steps in front of her as if to protect Cordelia.

However, he never takes his eyes off Van Niven, and quietly walks away, ready to move at a moment's notice.

<blank>

Van followed Karen's movements with his eyes, and his mouth was twisted into a smile, as if he was trying not to laugh.

<blank>

I'm here today to put the finishing touches on the project. We're here today to put the finishing touches on things."

<blank>

"...... finish? What the hell are you up to this time?

<blank>

Plot?

<blank>

Van's eyes widened again, as if he was truly surprised.

<blank>

What a terrible thing to say! What on earth could I possibly be up to? Have you ever known me to plot against you?

<blank>

He puts his hand on his chest and raises his eyebrows as if to say he is hurt.

<blank>

You can't possibly trust every word that comes out of your mouth!

<blank>

Hearing Karen's words, Van held his hand over his mouth as if he couldn't take it any longer.

<blank>

It's good! It's good, Karen! That is your true form, isn't it? Brave, strong, righteous eyes! It's wonderful!"

<blank>

Hiding his face with his hands, Van's shoulders shook slightly as if he was enduring something.

<blank>

"But! The thought of that face once again being painted with despair and sadness and devastated ......, is even more suggestive!

<blank>

The hand is removed, and what is revealed is only a look of pleasure and malice.

The corners of Van's mouth are wickedly and fearlessly lifted.

The white teeth that can be seen from the mouth are lined with sharp fangs reminiscent of those of a predator, and are a sight that shocks the viewer from the inside.

<blank>

Stop messing around!"

<blank>

Cordelia, however, was not intimidated by this fearless opponent and took the fight to him.

Van's mannerisms bring heat to her core.

<blank>

To begin with, the situation Karen has been in was orchestrated by the man in front of her!

It is this man who is the source of all this!

It was this man who took Karen's parents away from her and who treated her unjustly!

And yet, which one of you would say, in such a whitewashed manner, that you have never conspired?

<blank>

To top it all off, he says that it will bring further despair to Karen!

How far is this man willing to go to mess with Karen?

Fear is painted over, and anger from the depths of one's heart drives Cordelia.

<blank>

You! How far are you going to go to undermine Karen?

<blank>

'Undermine'? What are you saying? I am praising it. That's what makes it a fitting tribute!"

<blank>

You are ...... a dedicatee? You are ...... you! What the hell are you going to do with Karen?

<blank>

Just as Cordelia raised her voice sharply, a series of heavy sounds, like metal hitting metal, echoed from the distance.

The vibration was felt on the high ground where the girls were, and their feet trembled slightly.

<blank>

What?

What's that sound? No way!

<blank>

Karen extends her arm in front of Cordelia in alarm, but Cordelia's voice rises as if she can think of the sound.

<blank>

It's the sound of a physical barrier being erected. It seems that the warding device has been activated.

<blank>

Karen and Cordilia put their hands on the railing of the observation deck behind them and turned their attention to the lights of the warding device that was lit below.

The faint lights emitted a large amount of light one after another, and the pillar on which the lanterns that emitted the lights were mounted grew long and upward.

Then, between the stone pillars, which are warding devices, a thick wall rises one after another.

<blank>

This loud vibration is the sound that that thick wall makes around it as it rises.

<blank>

"Cody, this is ......."

<blank>

Something is probably coming from deep in the woods. Do you feel a bad vibe coming from deep in there?"

<blank>

As they watched the thick walls rise one after another, Karen and Cordelia sensed a disturbing movement behind them.

<blank>

"Due to the ineptitude of the lowly carrion-eaters, we are down over 30% from the number we had originally prepared ......, but there should be enough to overrun this place."

<blank>

Behind me, Van mutters, raising his eyebrows in discomfort.

But immediately, he spread his hands out in a grand gesture, and then he placed them on his chest and carefully folded them at the waist.

<blank>

Now then, let's get ready for the feast.

<blank>

No way! You think you're behind all this?

<blank>

Don't worry, Karen. I'll take the time and trouble to pluck your two lovely buds afterwards.

<blank>

As he spoke, Van's eyes took on the radiance of the inhuman, and his mouth turned up even wider.

The air leaks out, and a sneer escapes from the back of his throat.

<blank>

At that moment, Karen's fist ripped through the air.

<blank>

The magic mark on Karen's armor glowed faintly, and Karen's fist, instantly closing the gap between them, delivered a right-handed blow with Ki toward Van.

<blank>

Van instantly caught the fist with only his right hand, but the receiving fingers were shattered and spewed blood.

Cullen was transparent and landed a spinning left kick. But Van slips backwards and passes it by.

<blank>

This is wonderful. If I were to take it seriously, even I wouldn't be able to get away with it.

<blank>

Van opens his eyes and raises his right hand to his face, as if surprised. But there is already no scar on his hand.

<blank>

<blank>

I won't let you hurt those kids!"

<blank>

Karen stares at Van with a gush of anger in her eyes.

<blank>

You can rest assured that you will be well-matched.

<blank>

But Van, on the other hand, responds coolly and snaps his fingers.

Sledding, a human figure emerged from the shadows behind Van.

<blank>

I think I know who you're dealing with. ......

<blank>

The figure that emerged from the shadows in the back appeared to be a large person.

But the figure is too large.

And their silhouettes are strangely distorted as well.

Soon its head emerged from the shadows, illuminated by the lights of the observatory.

<blank>

"Rodrigo ...... no, I believe you said Fluke ......?"

<blank>

That is the counterpart I recently faced in front of a children's facility.

Karen called him Rodrigo at the time, but later learned from the board chairman that it was a pseudonym and that his real name was Fluke.

<blank>

However, the man was captured in the De Kembel Defense Organization's camp, and was later said to have disappeared during the recent undead riots.

Why is it here?

<blank>

Moreover, the man's behavior is more than a little strange.

His eyes are vacant and I can't tell where he is looking. Their mouths open and close like fish on land.

And was that man really this tall?

It is definitely much larger than the half-giant you occasionally see in town.

The silhouette of the body is also strange.

It is hard to tell for sure since it is not illuminated by lights, but it looks as if it is wearing a distorted costume.

<blank>

This is the product of the recent harvest. Well, I think it has matured reasonably well."

<blank>

Van steps back as he says this.

Shadows swirl around its body.

<blank>

Where are you going?

<blank>

Karen kicked the ground to close the gap again for Van, who was about to disappear.

But between the two, Fluke slips in quickly.

Karen winced at the impossible reaction time.

A fist comes down from above her head and shatters the ground where Karen was just a moment ago.

<blank>

?"

<blank>

Karen and Cordelia gulped when they saw Fluke's figure illuminated by the lights.

There was something there that looked like a human being.

<blank>

Two fists bite into the ground.

It was two arms extending from the shoulders and joining together to form a single arm.

The legs are the same. It is still a single leg, as if two legs were combined.

He was wearing a ragged-looking shirt and trousers, but the bulge in the shirt made it look like he still had arms around his sides.

And under the face of that fluke.

Another face was attached around the shoulder.

<blank>

? No way! Parker?

<blank>

That was Parker's face when he and Fluke attacked Karen and her friends that day.

His eyes are still vacant, and I can't tell where he is looking. His mouth is still moving as if he is breathing.

But the way they move their mouths is so unnatural and lifeless that it makes one cringe.

Karen is at a loss for words at the sight of someone she knows so well.

<blank>

I am not worried. I have since removed the yoke of 'person' from my life. I am no longer a person who can be contained by such a thing. I am proud to say that I have done a reasonable job.

<blank>

It is an eerie and fearless deformity.

It's like a grotesque, grotesque, bad-taste doll game of multiple dismembered dolls mixed into one.

This is a heterogeneous homologue made up of human bodies.

Van speaks of this blasphemous presence as if he were proud of his labor.

<blank>

"What in the world do you think people are ......! What the hell do you think people are!!!!"

<blank>

Humans? They are really insignificant, aren't they? Only by being of use to us in this way can they have a meaning to our existence, even though they are dust. I am happy for you.

<blank>

Cordilia, who can't help but feel nauseous at the deed, raises her voice at the act of trampling on human dignity.

Such protests, however, were no better than a mustard seed to Van.

<blank>

Now, I must return the favor a little while longer. Please play with this for a while instead of me.

<blank>

Van put his hand on his side and looked down toward the blue-lit warding device below.

And then it is about to disappear directly into the darkness.

<blank>

I'm not going to let you get away with this! You can't let him get away ----?

<blank>

Turning to Van, whose body dissolves into darkness, Cullen again instantly closes the gap.

But a moment before it reaches there, the wind rushes in from the side.

<blank>

A stiff arm flew toward Karen in a great trajectory.

It is a large reincarnation, but its speed is unusual. Karen quickly changes her own trajectory and distances herself from its large arm.

Furthermore, the arm that flew in was split into two in the middle.

One fist passed through the space where Karen had been a moment before, and one fist dug into the ground where she had also been.

<blank>

Cody! I'll draw him away! Get out of here while you still can!"

<blank>

'Sing to the wind, O old tree. Play a song of joy, a song of victory, and dance with us. ......"

<blank>

Cody?"

<blank>

"Wariness Rising!"

<blank>

What came back to Karen, who shouted at her to run away, was a war chant chanted by Cordelia, a support worker.

War chanting raises the level of Karen's fighting ability.

Reaction speed increases, both defensive and offensive capabilities increase, and magical power overflows.

<blank>

I won't leave again! No matter what! Never!

<blank>

Cody ............."

<blank>

He said, "I must make sure Karen is never left alone. I swore to ...... that I would protect her!"

<blank>

A huge left hand was wielded.

A large hook with a large trajectory but tremendous speed comes flying toward Karen. Next, Cordelia's magic sends a layer of air around Karen's arm.

The arm, which looks like a huge steel pillar approaching at high speed, is slightly bounced and its trajectory shifted when it comes into contact with the fast spinning air layer of Karen's arm.

Karen used the force of her flowing arm to shed it, and the huge body dragged by the arm lost its balance and fell down with the momentum.

<blank>

I believe in Karen. So does Karen! Trust me ......!"

<blank>

I don't think the damage has been done, even though the opponent has fallen.

Karen steps in place and tries to pause in time.

At the same time, he was truly amazed by Cordelia's support magic.

So much easier to fight!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Sturgeon. You head on over to your friend."

<blank>

Cordilia called out to her own followers.

A small white ball of fur came running from somewhere and instantly climbed up to Cordilia's shoulder. It moved the tip of its nose with a fine twitch and made a piquey sound. It was as if he was asking, "What do you mean?" Cordelia asked.

<blank>

And tell the Lord that demons are coming here.

<blank>

I am sure they will do well. They will defeat the ...... monster. 

<blank>

So, Karen and I will take care of this!

<blank>

Karen clenches her own fist and shadows to the right and left on the spot.

The body is more sharp than I imagined.

As it was, he looked back at Cordilia and nodded with strong eyes.

<blank>

I got it, Cody. I've got your back!"

<blank>

Yes, I'll take care of it! Leave it to me!"

<blank>

Spilling her white teeth, Karen throws a strong word to Cordelia.

Cordelia, who also received it, returned it to Karen with a happy smile.

<blank>

The next moment Karen runs.

Putting magical power on the magical armor to crush the deformed demons.

Wearing the magic of the wind with Cordelia's feelings, whom she trusts more than anyone else in this world.

To shoot a blow with all one's might at the deformity.
