# 125 Hidden Determination

I think I was only five or six when I first met her.

It is in a neighboring county, the residence of a man who claims to be a friend of your father's.

The rose garden in full bloom was so beautiful that I fell in love with the place at first sight.

<blank>

And the child was in that rose garden.

<blank>

The girl greeted me with a very pretty smile and a very happy laugh, saying that she had been waiting for you and looking forward to meeting you.

<blank>

The way she was smiling brightly and jumping around, surrounded by the fragrance of roses, was so unrealistic that I wondered if she was actually the spirit of roses. I still remember thinking at the time, "I wonder if this child is actually a rose spirit.

Even though I was very shy at the time, I quickly became friends with this girl and she became my best friend.

<blank>

Just being with her makes me smile naturally.

I will never forget the look in her eyes when I saw her for the first time, as if the light was about to spill out. The time I spent with her was more sparkling than any expensive jewelry, and she has become my treasure that can never be stored in a jewelry box.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

There was a time when we could not see each other for a while because of your father's schedule.

And at that time, he said, that boy's house was in a lot of trouble.

<blank>

The fathers were very sad and regretted it.

He said he couldn't do anything about his friend's importance.

<blank>

So he offered to at least let us reach out to that child and take care of him.

But he says the boy refused to do so.

<blank>

Why?

I could not understand her decision.

<blank>

If you would have accepted your father's offer, you could have spent much more time with me!

<blank>

That boy refused his father's invitation because he could not leave the land, his young brothers and his parents' remaining home.

<blank>

I can see now that I was probably only thinking of myself at the time.

Seeing that girl's tearful face for the first time was one of the reasons that disturbed me so much.

<blank>

His father must have asked me to persuade him, but he stubbornly refused to talk to me, and we ended up arguing with him.

...... likelihood, it's just that I was just unilaterally asking them to go with me, and it wasn't very persuasive, I wouldn't call it persuasion.

<blank>

In the end, "I don't know anymore!" I'll regret it! They finally broke up with each other, throwing out such words as "I don't know you anymore!

<blank>

But I was the one who regretted it.

I never meant to say those things.

I had no desire to pick a fight with that girl.

I never wanted that girl to look like that.

<blank>

I didn't see that girl again for many years after that.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

But when I heard that the girl was coming to Milia Castel Eye, my heart was shaken.

Just the pure thought of seeing that girl again made me happy.

<blank>

<blank>

I hadn't seen her in a few years, and she was like a different person.

Not even a shred of that bright smile remains. What in the world had happened before?

I was looking forward to seeing him, but I didn't even know how to talk to him.

<blank>

As the stories I heard came to my ears, my body began to shake with anger.

Why do you say that that girl should have to go through that?

<blank>

I wanted to say, "I'll go by your side right away, and I'll protect you from now on! I wanted to say.

But when I think back to a time when we had a fight once upon a time, the hand I tried to reach out stops, the foot that tried to go beside me stops.

I was too scared to speak to them, thinking that they would reject me again.

<blank>

I was so ashamed and frustrated that all I could do was watch her, that I couldn't look at her straight in the eyes anymore.

<blank>

But every time I see a decree that she was doing something terrible to that girl, I get angry.

Of course, it is not something that a daughter of a count's family can do as a daughter of a count's family, as she would not be able to fight with him head-on.

But every time I saw his face, I couldn't stop my mouth from opening.

<blank>

One morning, during an argument with the young lady in question, the young lady began to speak out of turn to the girl who happened to be there.

<blank>

I felt my mind going blank.

When confronted with strong words, the face becomes pale and the body becomes tense.

<blank>

That's not that girl.

<blank>

I could clearly see that her wings, which were as light as a rose fairy and shimmering like sunlight, had been cruelly picked off.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I wanted to stand in front of him and protect him, but I couldn't move my legs. I couldn't do anything.

I am sad and frustrated about that. ......

So, I could only thank her for protecting that girl, and although I thanked her, I don't know if she got the message. I was worried that I might have offended her.

<blank>

<blank>

But later, when we were able to open up in the same classroom, I was really relieved.

I was also relieved to find that she was a kinder person than I had expected.

<blank>

At the same time, I noticed a small jealousy rising in my head toward her for staying with him and protecting him.

I am very embarrassed about that.

<blank>

How shameless of you to be unilaterally jealous when you can't do anything yourself!

It is beyond absurd for such a person to want to protect that child!

I am ashamed of myself for whining that they don't depend on me.

<blank>

<blank>

This time I will not regret it!

This time I am .......

<blank>

I want to help that boy this time.

Such thoughts were coming up strongly from deep within my heart.
