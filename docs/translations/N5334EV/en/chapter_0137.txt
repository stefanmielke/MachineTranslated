# Chapter 125: Hidden Determination

I think the first time I met that child was when I was around five or six years old.

It was at the mansion of a friend of my father's, located in the neighboring county.

The rose garden in full bloom was so beautiful that I instantly fell in love with that place.

<b>

And that child was in that rose garden.

<b>

With a very cute smile, she welcomed me, saying, "I've been waiting for you" and "I was looking forward to meeting you," smiling happily.

<b>

Wrapped in the scent of roses, her bright laughter and joyful leaps felt so surreal that I thought at that moment, perhaps this child was a spirit of the roses. I still remember that thought.

Even though I had been very shy around strangers, I quickly became friends with her, and we became best friends.

<b>

Just being with her made me naturally smile.

I will surely never forget those eyes of hers, which seemed to overflow with light when I first saw her. The time I spent with her became my treasure, shining brighter than any expensive jewel, and it could never fit into a jewelry box.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Due to my father's circumstances, there was a period when we couldn't meet for a while.

During that time, I heard that something terrible had happened to her family.

<b>

My father and the others were deeply lamenting and regretting that they couldn't do anything for their friend.

<b>

So they said they wanted to at least extend a helping hand to her, to take care of her.

But I heard that she refused that offer.

<b>

Why?

I couldn't understand her judgment.

<b>

If she had accepted my father's offer, she could have been with me much longer!

<b>

She turned down my father's invitation because she couldn't leave that land, as she couldn't separate from her younger brothers and the home left by her parents.

<b>

Now I realize that at that time, I was only thinking about myself.

Seeing her face that seemed about to cry was one of the reasons that greatly disturbed my heart.

<b>

Even though my father had asked me to persuade her, I ended up arguing with her, who stubbornly refused to listen.

â€¦Of course, that was because I was one-sidedly insisting that we should go together, which couldn't really be called persuasion.

<b>

In the end, I threw out words like, "I don't care anymore!" and "You'll definitely regret this!" and we parted ways after a fight.

<b>

But it was I who regretted it.

I never intended to say such things.

I never wanted to fight with her.

I never wanted to see her make that face.

<b>

For many years after that, I couldn't meet her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

But when I heard that she was coming to Miriacastle, my heart was stirred.

Just the thought of being able to see her again filled me with joy.

<b>

<b>

The child I saw after several years looked like a completely different person.

There wasn't even a trace of that bright smile. What on earth had happened to her?

I had been looking forward to meeting her, but I didn't even know how to approach her.

<b>

When I heard the stories being told, my body trembled with anger.

Why did she have to go through such things?

<b>

I wanted to rush to her side and tell her that from now on, I would protect her!

But remembering the time we had fought, my outstretched hand and my feet that were about to approach her stopped.

The thought of being rejected again scared me, and I couldn't bring myself to speak.

<b>

Feeling helpless, frustrated, and restless, I eventually found it hard to look directly at her.

<b>

However, every time I saw the cruel things done to her, anger welled up inside me.

Of course, as the daughter of an earl, I couldn't act in a way that would lead to a direct confrontation.

But each time I saw that face, I couldn't stop my mouth from opening.

<b>

One morning, while I was arguing with that noble lady, she unexpectedly began to hurl insults at that child who happened to be present.

<b>

I felt my mind going completely blank.

Faced with harsh words, the child lost her color and tensed up.

<b>

That wasn't her.

<b>

I could clearly see that her wings, which had once been as light as a rose fairy and sparkled like sunlight, were being cruelly torn away.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I wanted to stand in front of her and protect her, but my feet wouldn't move. I couldn't do anything.

That was so sad and frustrating...

So, I could only feel gratitude towards the girl who had protected her, and I thanked her, but I didn't know if it was conveyed properly. Rather, I became anxious that I might have upset her.

<b>

<b>

But after that, when I was able to get along with her in the same classroom, I truly felt relieved.

I was also relieved to find out that she was kinder than I had expected.

<b>

At the same time, I realized that a small feeling of jealousy had arisen towards her, who was by that child's side and protecting her.

I felt very embarrassed about that.

<b>

How shameful it is to be jealous unilaterally when I can't do anything myself!

How ridiculous for someone like me to think I want to protect that child!

It was pathetic of me to complain that she didn't rely on me.

<b>

<b>

This time, I won't regret it!

This time, I will...

<b>

I want to be a strength to that child this time.

That thought was rising strongly from deep within my heart.
