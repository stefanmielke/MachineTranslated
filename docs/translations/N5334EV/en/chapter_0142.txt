# 130 Annie's Pochette

Irving told her that her work was done for the day, and Annie was sent directly to her own residence.

<blank>

I told Irving at the time that I would ask my father to send someone to guard him, but my father is not at the mansion right now. It was only half past 3:00 p.m., so it was only natural that he was at work.

So Annie got the butler of the house, told him the gist of what had happened, and asked him to tell her father to send someone to guard the house.

<blank>

<blank>

Annie no longer considers that young twin, who adores her, a stranger.

Irving had told her that 'the job was done,' but she had no intention of ending it herself.

<blank>

According to the other children who were at the facility, the caretaker would not be back until the evening. The twins' sister doesn't get off work until after dusk. So, are we supposed to stay at that place with just the children until then?

<blank>

There is no way I would allow such a thing.

I am sure that those children must be feeling lonely right now with only their children.

At the very least, he should stay with them until the security people that Father will arrange for him arrive!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

She returned to her room, picked up the necessary items, and turned her feet immediately to the kitchen of the mansion.

He then approached a young apprentice cook who was cleaning the kitchen.

<blank>

Nord! Do you have any snacks?"

"...... Miss. Don't be such a picky eater, okay?"

No, I'm not! I don't want to eat it! I want to take it to the children at the shelter!"

"Facility ......? Oh! Are you on your way there now?"

<blank>

Annie's father, Philip, couldn't help but mention his daughter's activities to those around him at every opportunity.

Thanks to his paternalism, those who work at the mansion naturally have the opportunity to hear the story over and over again.

<blank>

So it was only natural that this young apprentice knew that Annie went to the facility every day.

<blank>

I'd like to bring you a souvenir! I'd like to bring you something. ......, no?"

'It's just past tea time, you know. If it's something the young lady can carry with her, she'll be able to find it at ....... Ah! I have quite a few cookies that are misshapen and unattractive.

"Uneven?"

Yes! It tastes so good that everyone picks it up when they're feeling a little hungry."

<blank>

Annie nods her head at this young apprentice nord's story.

This is, after all, the place where the consulate's food is prepared. The head chef is kind to Annie, but is known to be strict in the kitchen.

Annie was uncomfortable with the fact that there were misshapen cookies in such a place.

<blank>

This is what Sari made."

Sari?

<blank>

Sari is also one of the maids working at the consulate, still young, in her mid-teens, and she and Annie know each other well.

Nord crouches down and pulls out a rather large can from storage and holds it out in front of Annie as he continues his story.

<blank>

'Whatever, I heard he baked it to give to someone. ...... Oh, I'll wrap it up in one of these napkins."

"Who is ...... somebody?"

I didn't ask him that much, but he was very enthusiastic. But he was making them with a lot of enthusiasm.

Heh. 〜〜〜〜."

<blank>

This is interesting information.

Sari is like a family member to Annie. Since they are close in age, it is her job to take care of Annie's personal needs.

Even this morning, when she set my hair and sent me off to school, she was the same as usual.

When did that happen? I never heard such an interesting story!

<blank>

Annie was a little tempted to ask Nord about it, but she knew better than to do so, so she restrained herself.

However, I made up my mind that when I returned from the twins' place today, I would ask Sari herself to tell me everything about what was going on.

<blank>

As I look at the table with this determination, I see some strangely shaped cookies going into a pile on a large table napkin.

<blank>

Long-legged cat.

"It's a horse, apparently."

"Lots of spikes, but stars?"

I think he said he was going to build ...... a castle."

"This is ...... trees, right?"

He said he was a ...... knight."

<blank>

Annie nodded in agreement at the pile of cookies. I have no idea what they are.

<blank>

After mass-producing a number of products whose shapes were unclear, they eventually settled on bland shapes such as circles and squares.

<blank>

If you take a bite to try one, the taste is not bad.

The buttery flavor of these cookies is a nice quality. It's a little like Sari, but it's not too much to say, "Why didn't they do that from the beginning?

<blank>

Thinking about this, Annie stuffs the cookies wrapped in a napkin into the pochette she brought from her room.

<blank>

This pochette is an amcam souvenir from Suzy and is covered with space compression magic.

Its capacity is approximately five times greater.

Three wrapped napkins fit in, each wrapped large enough to fit an adult's two extra hands, but there is still plenty of room to spare.

It is not very decorative and seems a little plain for a girl to carry, but it is very practical.

<blank>

This pochette has other tricks up its sleeve as a magical tool.

When Suzy taught her the trick, Annie jumped for joy, and the adults other than her parents ......, that is, Sari and the other servants, listened with a slight twitch in their cheeks.

It is indeed a gem that has been prepared in a way that is typical of AMCAM.

<blank>

<blank>

Annie slung the pochette over her shoulder, thanked Nord, the apprentice cook, and left the kitchen.

<blank>

Thinking about serving cookies to the children naturally makes my cheeks loose now.

Annie quickly made her way to the facility where the twins were once again.
