# Chapter 130: Annie's Pouch

Annie was informed by Irvin that "today's work is over," and she was taken straight to her mansion.

<b>

She had told Irvin at that time to ask for guards from her father, but her father was not in the mansion now. It was only just past 3 PM, so it was natural for him to be at work.

So, Annie caught the butler of the mansion and briefly explained the situation, asking him to convey her request for guards to her father.

<b>

<b>

Annie no longer thought of the young twins who adored her as strangers.

Although Irvin had said "work is over," she had no intention of ending things just yet.

<b>

According to the other children at the facility, the caretaker wouldn’t return until evening. The twins' older sister also finished work after evening. So, were they supposed to stay at that place alone until then?

<b>

There was absolutely no way she could allow that.

Surely, those children must be feeling lonely being left alone.

At the very least, she had to stay with them until the guards her father arranged arrived!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

She returned to her room to grab what she needed and immediately headed to the mansion's kitchen.

There, she called out to a young apprentice cook who was cleaning the kitchen.

<b>

"Nord! Do you have any sweets?"

"…Miss. You shouldn't be snacking like that, you know?"

"That's not it! I’m not eating them! I want to take some to the children at the facility!"

"The facility...? Oh! Are you heading there now?"

<b>

Annie's father, Philip, couldn’t help but talk about his daughter's activities every chance he got.

Thanks to his doting nature, those who worked in the mansion naturally had many opportunities to hear about it.

<b>

Thus, it was only natural that this young apprentice was aware that Annie visited the facility every day.

<b>

"That's right! I want to bring some souvenirs... is that not allowed?"

"Well, tea time has just passed. If it’s something you can carry... Ah! We do have some cookies that are irregularly shaped and not very presentable."

"Irregularly shaped?"

"Yes! The taste is decent, so everyone nibbles on them when they feel peckish."

<b>

Annie tilted her head at Nord's words.

This place, after all, was responsible for the consulate's cooking. The head chef was kind to Annie, but she had heard he was strict in the kitchen.

In such a place, she felt it was odd that there were irregularly shaped cookies.

<b>

"These were made by Sari."

"Sari?"

<b>

Sari was one of the maids working at the consulate, still young in her mid-teens, and well acquainted with Annie.

Nord squatted down and took out a rather large tin from the storage, continuing to speak as he placed it in front of Annie.

<b>

"Apparently, she baked them for someone... Oh, I’ll wrap them in this napkin."

"…Who is 'someone'?"

"I didn’t ask that far. But she was quite enthusiastic about making them."

"Really~~~~"

<b>

This was quite interesting information.

Sari was like family to Annie. Being close in age, it was Sari's job to take care of Annie.

Just this morning, she had styled Annie's hair and sent her off to school as usual.

When had that happened? She hadn’t heard any such interesting stories!!

<b>

Annie felt a strong urge to ask Nord about this matter in detail, but she also understood that now was not the time, so she restrained herself.

However, she resolved to ask Sari all about it when she returned from the twins’ place today.

<b>

As she made that decision and looked at the table, she saw cookies of various strange shapes piling up on a large table napkin.

<b>

"A cat with long legs."

"It looks like a horse."

"It has a lot of spikes, but is it a star?"

"…I think they said they were trying to make a castle."

"This is... supposed to be a tree, right?"

"…They said it was a knight."

<b>

Annie nodded at the piled cookies, realizing she had no idea what they were supposed to be.

After producing a large quantity of shapes that were hard to identify, they had ultimately settled on safe shapes like circles and squares.

<b>

When she tried one, the taste was not bad.

The rich flavor of butter spread across her mouth; it was a quality cookie. She couldn’t help but think, "They should have just done it this way from the start," but it was also very much like Sari.

<b>

While thinking about this, Annie packed the cookies wrapped in a napkin into the pouch she had brought from her room.

<b>

This pouch was a souvenir from Amukamu given to her by Suzy, enchanted with space-compression magic.

Its capacity was roughly five times larger.

Three napkins wrapped with cookies fit comfortably, and there was still plenty of room left.

It was a bit plain for a girl to carry, but its practicality was very high.

<b>

This pouch also had other magical mechanisms.

When Suzy explained these mechanisms to Annie, she jumped for joy, while the adults other than her parents… including Sari and the other servants, listened with slightly strained smiles.

It was indeed a product with a very Amukamu-like touch.

<b>

<b>

After slinging the pouch over her shoulder, Annie thanked the apprentice cook Nord and left the kitchen.

<b>

Thinking about treating the children to cookies made her cheeks naturally soften.

Annie hurriedly headed back to the facility where the twins were.
