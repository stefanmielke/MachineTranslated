# 74 Howard Cloud's resolve.

Sorry for keeping you waiting so long! (Sliding down on knees)

<blank>

I will post daily today and tomorrow!


----------------

<blank>

You're gonna be in here for a while.

<blank>

A shadowy man drops into his own shadow, holding hands with a vampire burned by the morning sun.

<blank>

You guys, too. You guys be good inside until the sun settles."

<blank>

The shadow at the man's feet grew so large that it swallowed the two remaining vampires in its embrace.

<blank>

"Hey, you're the Iron God, aren't you? Kuha!

<blank>

The man said this as he looked at Howard, carrying a huge shadow on his back.

And just like that, the shadow spread out like wings and landed on top of the wall in front of Howard.

<blank>

......That's right, these guys can't handle it. Kuhahaha!

<blank>

The man pulled out a huge sword strapped to his back, put it on his shoulder without holding it up, and tapped Howard on the shoulder with it with a tension-free face, as if he were making small talk.

<blank>

I hear you're pretty good at it. I know a rumor ...... that you are an "iron demon god who destroys even demons without leaving any ashes. Scary, scary, scary! Kuhahahaha!

Hmph! When did that happen? ......"

<blank>

Howard took a quick glance around, not distracting his attention from the man.

Immediately nearby, Conrad and Gilbert are on the ground.

<blank>

ï¼ˆGilbert is a "glass foot" with high speed but low durability. It is only natural that he would be unable to move if he received a big blow. It would be bad for him if he did not receive medical treatment soon.

Even though it was right after Conrad had released a large amount of magic power, it was hard to believe that he would be incapacitated by a single blow. (But there is no doubt that he is a formidable opponent!)

<blank>

Kyle, Tony, take the two of you and hurry back."

<blank>

Howard kept his eyes on the man and told the two young men so.

Kyle and Tony looked hesitant for a moment, but immediately followed Howard's lead and dragged them back.

<blank>

Sorry Kyle, Tony, thanks for the help ......"

<blank>

Howard muttered quietly.

<blank>

As if standing between Kyle and the man, Howard stepped forward, released his stance, and lowered his sword.

With his strength relaxed on the spot, he turns to the man and asks him a question.

<blank>

Are you the ringleader this time?

Aah?"

I ask if you are the master of these undead."

"Well, these women were mine to begin with, weren't they? And the bones are mine, too, so I guess I'm the boss of them. Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

"...... What is your aim? What is your purpose in controlling such a large army?"

"Oh? What's the purpose? We, at ......, are only preying on living people if they are there. That's all we are, for better or worse. Nothing more, nothing less. Am I right? Ha ha ha!

"............"

Oh, and that's the thing! It's even better if there's a nice girl. It would be a man's greatest pleasure to send her back to paradise, body and soul, wouldn't it? Right? Kuha-ha-ha! Kuhahahaha!

"......, not even going to start with the serious stuff.

Kuha! What are you talking about? We're talking like this, right? What's wrong with that? Right? Kuha! Huh? Oh, you haven't introduced yourself yet? I'm sorry about that! You can't have a conversation with someone who doesn't even tell you his name, can you? Kuhahahahaha!

<blank>

The man speaks to me in an aloof manner from start to finish.

They were like old acquaintances you meet by chance on the street or at a bar, and you hit it off with them.

<blank>

I'm Halbert. I'm Halbert East. Pleased to meet you! Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

The man smiled carefree, approached Howard with light steps, and held out his right hand as if he wanted to shake his hand.

Despite being covered by a black beard, his smile is like that of a boy with no evil intentions.

Most people would have been poisoned by that smile.

Howard switched the "Grand Divider" to his left hand and put out his right hand to match his opponent's hand.

<blank>

<blank>

---- that moment

<blank>

A huge blade was approaching close above Howard's head, with a force that could shatter even a huge rock.

<blank>

But at the same time, the magic seal on Howard's equipment glows.

He repelled the approaching deadly blade with the "Grand Divider" held with his left, which is caged in magic power.

A violent metallic sound echoed around them, and a gust of wind created by the sword pressure blew around them.

<blank>

'Hmph! That's a very obvious ...... move!"

Kuha! I'm still an inedible old man! Kuha ha ha ha!

<blank>

The vampire, who introduced himself as "Halbert," smeared his previous friendly demeanor, put a vicious glint in his eyes, bared his fangs like a predator, and struck with his supremacy.

Howard muttered to himself, "Well, that's a very typical character.

<blank>

Howard receives, ducks, and dispatches a barrage of sword blows that come at him in rapid succession.

Roaringly, each other's swords cut through the atmosphere, and a storm of fighting air swept around them.

<blank>

Kuhahaha! It's more than I imagined! It's more than I imagined, Iron Demon God! Kuhahahahaha!

<blank>

Wielding a sword larger than his own body with one hand, squinting his crimson eyes and dancing in the waves of violence, the vampire shouted loudly in amusement.

<blank>

The fearless blade, as if its blood had hardened and formed a shape, scatters a miasma around the area with each swing.

The blade, which looks like it is made up of some kind of bone, is martial and disastrous.

It's a weight that makes sense when you are told that it is made from the bones of that "Dark Skjeldanasor".

<blank>

When Howard's grand divider meets the deadly blade head-on, a heavy, bone-chilling shock falls to the core of his body.

Even just playing with the blade leaves a nasty numbness in the hand.

<blank>

The vampire danced with his dreadlocks, his dark skin dancing, and his sword swinging in all directions.

<blank>

As the sun rose, the shadow the vampire was carrying grew smaller.

Eventually, the shadow became smaller and smaller, as if absorbed into the back, and finally vanished.

<blank>

"Well, are we about to get down to business? Hey, Iron God? Kuha! Kuha ha ha ha!

<blank>

The vampire, the shadow on his back gone, laughs and swings his huge blade even more boldly.

Howard felt the bones in his body creak as he was hit by a sword fight that was shot with a weight he had never felt before.

<blank>

Apparently, we can't just let it go through.

<blank>

With a long, quiet exhale, Howard deeply imbues his equipment with magical power.

Magic power also passes through the magic seal engraved on the middle layer of the equipment, creating a double layer of radiance emitted by the equipment.

<blank>

Sprinkled with the glimmer of magic power that the magical costume wears, it instantly closes the gap between it and the vampire.

He pushed through the layer of air pressing down on the vampire's body and swung the Grand Divider, which was held to his left, at the vampire's neck.

<blank>

But the sword streak snatches the vampire and cuts through the air.

The next moment, a deadly blade slashed up from below Howard's left side. He swept his body to the right, but immediately afterward, the blade that had cut back fell.

He struck the vampire in the belly with the hilt of the returned grand divider, brushed it off, and, continuing in the same vein, swung the tip of the sword again toward the vampire's throat.

The vampire, however, turns his body away and lets it pass.

Bending down and raising his chin, the vampire looks at Howard, his fangs bared and the corners of his mouth raised.

Then, with his upper body turned, he glides into Howard's space and again brings down his vicious great sword.

Howard plays it off, and after a few more slashes, they both take a step back, and then move their legs at a certain distance to see how their opponents will react.

<blank>

To the average person, this whole exchange took place in the blink of an eye.

In fact, Kyle and Tony, who were watching the battle from a distance, could not see what was happening there.

<blank>

Howard's sword had indeed slashed the vampire's throat in the current strike.

But the wound has already been closed.

In contrast, Howard's cheek was gouged by a vampire's deadly blade and dripping with blood.

It should have been a slight wound, but I felt as if all my magic and strength had been taken away.

<blank>

So this is what caused Conrad and Gilbert to be unable to fight.

Howard can think of the weapon and its owner.

<blank>

Was it "The Immortal General," ......?"

How?"

<blank>

The vampire slung his greatsword back over his shoulder and raised his eyebrows as if to say, did you know?

<blank>

The vampire is a fearless "corpse generator" who brings the dead back to life and manipulates them. It is said that a vampire once led a great army of immortals to destroy a small southern kingdom in a single night. The Immortal General Halbert!

Cook. ......."

The weapon wielded by his hand is the Disappear Bringer, a magical sword that is said to feed on the souls of men.

'Kukkkkkk ...... kuhahaha! Kuhahahahaha! What a surprise! I didn't think there was anyone in this world who knew! Kuhahahahaha!"

<blank>

The vampire began to laugh, but in a very amused voice.

<blank>

I've been ...... reluctantly familiar with you guys. I thought that sword ...... was some kind of fairy tale."

Kuha! That's what I'm talking about! Those who are carved with this, their souls will be gouged out and eaten by me! Your lives taste good, Iron God! Kuhahahahaha!

<blank>

The vampire, with the magic sword slung over his shoulder, giggled and laughed, his red tongue sticking out and licking it.

<blank>

The last written record of you in the country is 400 years old. What are you doing raising an army in this age? Do you think you can take over the country?

"...... country-taking hey ....... What do you think? Kuha! It's not about that, it's ......! Tekkishin! I've been stuck for a while ....... Now that I'm finally able to move, my body is itching to get out of control! What? Hey! You're even more powerful than before, aren't you? Tetsukishin! You're ready to kill each other, aren't you? Huh? Let's do it! Don't bore me to death! Kuhahahahahahahaha!

<blank>

The vampire, with his sword slung over his shoulder, stares at Howard with glazed eyes and opens his legs to save his strength, and then he drops deeply into his waist.

<blank>

"Very well, vampire! Wield your power to your heart's content! But don't underestimate my old bones. I will not give my life so easily!

<blank>

Howard and the vampire began to kill each other, grinding each other's souls.

<blank>

<blank>

â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you Jacob. I'm okay now."

<blank>

Sonia Cloud smiled as she checked the aroma of the tea brewed by Jacob Evans, head butler of the Amscombe House.

The deep reddish tea color was sprinkled with small ripples of amber light.

<blank>

Where are Augustus and the others?

The first to arrive at their stations are those who are ready to go.

<blank>

After taking a sip of tea and letting out a deep, relaxing sigh, Sonia quietly asked Jacob, staring at the sparkle in the tea cup.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Shortly before now, the sound of a small piece of glass breaking echoed through the quiet lounge.

It was the sound of a picture frame on the mantelpiece striking the floor.

<blank>

Inside the lounge, Sonia Cloud, who had been receiving reports from the butlers, walked up to the mantelpiece and lost all color in her face when she saw the fallen picture frame.

Things that were not supposed to fall fell, and things that were not supposed to break broke.

Sonia's color faded as she looked at the portrait of Howard Cloud in the broken picture frame.

The vague, drifting, murky uneasiness that had existed before Howard left Amkam, was now strongly present in Sonia's mind as a certainty.

<blank>

When he told me that he had decided to go to Irosio, when I saw him off on his departure, and during the week of anxious waiting, the sense of anxiety was with me.

...... And when he received word that he had been attacked by a large army of immortals in the depths of Ilocio, he felt his chest tighten to the point that he could hardly breathe.

But even so, Howard would probably come back laughing as usual, right? There was certainly such hope.

But now, he felt as if that sliver of hope had been shattered into tiny pieces.

At this moment, something irreparable is happening to Howard.

It was undeniably a conviction that Sonia held.

<blank>

When Sonia was about to collapse, Jacob, the head butler, supported her and sat her down on the sofa about 30 minutes before now.

<blank>

Now, the pale blush had returned to his pale, bloodless complexion, and Jacob's eyes, which had been caring for Sonia, had taken on a calm hue of relief.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"I have heard that the patriarchs who have gone to their villages have been told by pigeon to remain on guard and not to return to Amkham.

Even if we hold Amkham, it will be meaningless if the rest of the army overflows. Even if they have an army of more than 10,000, they must not let even one of them pass through the forest.

You are absolutely right.

<blank>

After Sonia regained her composure, Jacob began to tell her the rest of the report he had been giving.

<blank>

So, where is the delegation leader now?

Yes, I just received word that you have left Copetown.

"...... Well, then, shall we have you wait around Masom down the road? We need you to fulfill your responsibility, Mr. Representative. ......"

Are the two suspicious persons in the custody of the Byros family?

Tell them, "Yes, I'll leave it to you. Tell them to do as they please. Also, there was a guy who managed to escape from the house, but you can find him at ....... He seems to be quite skilled, so make sure he is escorted by a group of 7th graders or older.

"Thank you."

<blank>

Sonia puts the tea cup back on the table and looks at Jacob as if to ask him more questions.

<blank>

How ready are Elrose and the others?

Yes, the preparations are progressing smoothly with the wives in the plaza in front of the I chopping room. The foodstuffs have just been dispatched from here as well.

Yes, thank you Jacob. I'll be on my way soon. I don't want to be too late for Melbert and Jane.

<blank>

With that said, Sonia shifted her gaze to the table as she stood up.

There, moved from the top of the mantelpiece, was a family photo laid out on a table.

Besides the broken Howard photo frame, some of my own, some of Susie's, and some of Lavinia's.

He stared softly at the table on which photos of the entire family were placed side by side.

<blank>

Sonia thinks ....... I think that no matter what the circumstances, Howard will always come back to you if he has a destiny to return.

However, if there is a decision to be made and Howard chooses to sink into it, then Sonia accepts it.

Whether you agree with it or not, you can't move that fact.

If that is the case, I will take it all in.

Because I am the woman of Amkam and the wife of Howard Cloud! And.

However, you can still visit .............

<blank>

"Ravi, protect your father ....... Suzy, please take care of Howard. ......!"

<blank>

Sonia clutched a picture of her two daughters to her chest and silently and powerfully prayed.

<blank>

<blank>

â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†â—†

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The metallic sound of heavy sword blows echoes through the forest like a ghost.

We've been at it for a few hours now.

<blank>

Armor, which even the fangs of a high-ranking demonic beast could not easily penetrate, was sliced in various directions.

His "Disappear Bringer", which is said to eat souls, was definitely doing a lot of damage to my armor.

<blank>

When you get this many wounds, it's hard to hide the fact that you are indeed worn out. Breathing heavily on my shoulder, there is no way to cover it up.

<blank>

Vampires, on the other hand, disappear in the blink of an eye, even with a few scratches.

I must have done some fatal damage, but the result is still the same. It will be back to normal soon.

It's not a good thing at all! I couldn't help but let out a giggle.

<blank>

At any rate, they are drained of physical and magical power. We are already running out of energy and magic power.

This guy is not so naive as to think that he can do anything about it by putting out all of his power.

Then there is only one path to take. We must challenge with all the strength we have!

They're going to make me eat my favorite food!

<blank>

<blank>

My armor, which has no control beads, can be used without suppressing the magic of the wearer.

For those unfamiliar with the technique, it will quickly deplete their magical power, but once they get the hang of it, the power can be freely channeled in and out.

<blank>

When wielding a large technique, he uses the magical power temporarily stored in his armor and releases it.

Otherwise, every time you perform a technique, it will consume an unlimited amount of the equipped person's magical power.

<blank>

The "Ichino Geki" and "Ninoh Geki" are techniques that use stored magic power.

However, the "three blows" do not stop at the stored magic power, but are a blow that greatly reduces the magic power of the equipped person.

<blank>

It is a double-edged sword that eats its own body and kills.

<blank>

<blank>

Huh, no way.

I never thought I would meet so many enemies at the end of my life. ......

Life is truly a strange thing.

However, when I think that there is someone I can entrust my successor to, I can go on ahead without worrying.

With that boy there, what would I have to worry about?

...... Sorry Sonia. I'm not sure I'm going to make it home this time.

<blank>

<blank>

The vampire, as usual, comes with fangs bared and the corners of his mouth raised, skillfully manipulating his magic sword.

While dealing with the sword, the eagle quietly raises its magical power and pours it into the armor.

<blank>

My armor, "Ultimate Ouroboros," is a three-layered magical armor made of layers of magical beast leather and magical steel.

Each of the three layers has a reinforced magic mark.

I'm currently trying to get to the second layer of magic seals with all my magic power, but it's still not enough against this guy.

However, if all three layers of magic seals are released, a dramatic increase in combat power can be expected, but at the cost of a much greater consumption of magic power.

Although it can be controlled by itself, this is almost the same as shattering the control beads of other people's armor.

<blank>

And this is a necessary process to compensate for the magical power to release the "three blows".

<blank>

Without hesitation, the eagle opens a path to the third magic mark.

The light of the magic seal, which was twofold, becomes threefold and shines more brightly.

He instantly stepped in front of the enemy and swung down a blow with all his might.

He quickly received it with his magic sword, but his feet could not bear the weight of the blow, and it pierced the earth, making the ground hollow.

He continues to strike with his sword, which he also deftly handles.

<blank>

With the sword I slashed up, I cut off his left second arm, which is instantly connected and repaired.

The next thing I know, his blade is biting into my side.

He kicked him in the gut, opening up the distance, but he quickly closed the gap with a crushing blow to the ground and struck a follow-up blow.

<blank>

After several more slashes, I flicked upward the blade that was swung down on me.

He steps into the slight opening in the chest with all his might.

Then, all of his condensed magic power is released all at once toward that one point.

<blank>

Eraser Brit."

Three lines of magical power extending from the shoulders of the equipment are momentarily converged into a grand divider, which is then explosively released.

<blank>

If this is released, the eagle will be nothing more than a mere squeeze piece.

If you remove it, that's it.

Even if you can endure it, there is no next time.

This is a blow to the backwaters.

<blank>

Farewell wife and daughter!"

<blank>

Take the last and greatest blow of my life!
