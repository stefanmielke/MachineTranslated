# Chapter 74: Howard Cloud's Resolve

I’m sorry for always keeping you waiting—! (sliding dogeza)

<b>

I will post continuously today and tomorrow!

----------------

<b>

“You’re going to stay in here for a while.”

<b>

A shadowy man placed his hand on the vampire scorched by the morning sun and began to pull him into his own shadow.

<b>

“You guys too. Be good in there until the sun settles down.”

<b>

The shadow at the man's feet stretched out, enveloping the remaining two vampires as if to embrace them.

<b>

“Hey, you’re the ‘Iron Demon God,’ right? Kuha!”

<b>

Carrying a massive shadow, the man turned his gaze to Howard and said that.

Then, spreading his shadow like wings, he descended from the wall right in front of Howard.

<b>

“...I see, these guys are definitely beyond my ability to handle. Kuha ha!”

<b>

The man drew out a gigantic sword strapped to his back, resting it on his shoulder without taking a stance, and casually began to chat with Howard as if they were having a casual conversation.

<b>

“You seem pretty capable, huh? I’ve heard the rumors... ‘The Iron Demon God who annihilates even demons without leaving ashes.’ Scary, huh? Scary, scary! Kuha ha ha!”

“Hmph! What era are you talking about...”

<b>

While not taking his eyes off the man, Howard quickly glanced around.

Nearby, Conrad and Gilbert were lying on the ground.

<b>

(Gilbert is a ‘Glassfoot’ with high speed but low endurance. It’s only natural that he would be incapacitated by a single heavy blow. I must get him treated quickly, or it will lead to a bad situation.

Even though Conrad released a massive amount of magical power just before, it’s hard to believe he was taken out in one hit. However, there’s no doubt that this guy is a dangerous opponent!)

<b>

“Kyle, Tony. Hurry and take the two of them back.”

<b>

Howard told the two young men without averting his gaze from the man.

Kyle and Tony hesitated for a moment, but quickly understood Howard's intent and dragged the two away.

<b>

“Sorry, Kyle, Tony, thanks for your help...”

<b>

Howard muttered quietly.

<b>

Standing between Kyle and the man, Howard took a step forward, relaxed his stance, and lowered his sword.

With his strength relaxed, he faced the man and asked.

<b>

“Are you the leader this time?”

“Ah?”

“I’m asking if you’re the boss of these undead.”

“Well, these women were originally mine, and the bones were summoned by me, so I guess you could say I’m the boss? Kuha ha!”

<b>

“...What’s your aim? What’s the purpose of commanding such a large army?”

“Ah? My purpose? Well... if there are living humans there, we just eat them. Good or bad, that’s all they are to us. Nothing more, nothing less. Isn’t that right? Kuha ha!”

“............”

“Ah, and also, if there are good women, that’s even better. Sending a good woman’s body and soul to paradise is a man’s greatest joy, isn’t it? Huh? Kuha! Kuha ha ha!”

“...Hmph, you never intended to have a serious conversation, did you?”

“Kuha! What are you talking about? We’re having a solid conversation right now, aren’t we? What’s there to be dissatisfied about? Huh? Kuha ha! Oh? Speaking of which, I forgot to introduce myself! My bad! It’s hard to have a conversation with someone who hasn’t even introduced themselves, right? Kuha ha ha ha!”

<b>

The man continued to speak with a carefree attitude.

As if he were an old acquaintance met by chance on the street, he smiled and spoke to Howard in a relaxed and friendly manner.

<b>

“I’m Halbert. I’m Halbert East. Nice to meet you! Kuha ha!”

<b>

The man approached Howard with an untroubled smile, extending his right hand as if to shake hands.

Despite being covered in a black beard, his smile resembled that of an innocent boy.

Most people would likely be disarmed by such a smile.

Howard switched the ‘Grand Divider’ to his left hand and extended his right hand to match the other’s.

<b>

<b>

――――In that instant

<b>

A massive, deadly blade approached Howard’s head with the force to shatter a boulder.

<b>

However, at the same time, the magical sigils on Howard's equipment began to glow.

He deflected the approaching deadly blade with the ‘Grand Divider’ in his left hand, infused with magical power.

A loud metallic sound echoed around them, and a gust of wind generated by the sword pressure swirled around the two.

<b>

“Hmph! Transparent... move!”

“Kuha! You really are an unappetizing old man! Kuha ha ha!”

<b>

The vampire, who introduced himself as Halbert, wiped away his previous friendly demeanor, his eyes filled with a vicious light, baring his fangs like a carnivorous beast.

Indeed, that’s his true nature, Howard muttered.

<b>

Howard received, dodged, and parried the rapid succession of wicked sword strikes.

The sound of their swords cutting through the air roared, and a storm of fighting spirit raged around them.

<b>

“Kuha ha ha! More than I imagined! More than I imagined, Iron Demon God!! Kuha ha ha ha!!”

<b>

Swinging a sword larger than himself with one hand, narrowing his eyes that glowed red, the vampire joyfully shouted as he danced in the waves of violent force.

The terrifying blade, as if formed from coagulated blood, scattered miasma with every swing.

The blade, resembling a combination of bones, was rugged and ominous.

One could believe it was made from the bones of the ‘Dark Scale Dinaso’ given its weight.

<b>

If Howard were to take that deadly blade head-on with the Grand Divider, a heavy shock would resonate deep within his bones.

Even just deflecting the blade left an unpleasant numbness in his hand.

<b>

The vampire, with his dreadlocks swaying, danced with his dark skin, swinging his sword in all directions.

<b>

As the sun rose, the shadow that the vampire had been carrying shrank.

Eventually, that shadow seemed to be absorbed into his back and disappeared completely.

<b>

“Well then, is it about time for the real show? Hey, Iron Demon God?! Kuha! Kuha ha ha!”

<b>

The vampire, now without the shadow he had been carrying, laughed as he swung his massive blade even more boldly.

Receiving the sword strikes that came down with unprecedented weight, Howard felt the bones in his body creak.

<b>

It seemed that he couldn’t just push through like this.

<b>

Taking a long, quiet breath, Howard deeply infused magical power into his equipment.

The magical sigils engraved in the layers of his equipment were filled with magical power, and the glow emitted by the equipment doubled.

<b>

The magical power enveloping the magical armor spread out, and in an instant, he closed the distance between himself and the vampire.

He pushed through the layer of air that pressed against him and swung the Grand Divider, which he held in his left hand, toward the vampire’s neck.

<b>

However, the sword missed the vampire and sliced through the air.

In the next moment, a deadly blade slashed upward from Howard's lower left. He dodged it by flowing his body to the right, but immediately afterward, a counterattack came down.

He struck the blade with the hilt of the Grand Divider he had pulled back, knocking it away, and in that flow, he swung the tip of the sword back toward the vampire’s throat.

But the vampire arched his body and evaded it.

With his chin raised and his body bent back, the vampire looked at Howard, baring his fangs and grinning.

Then, while still bent back, he smoothly entered Howard’s range and swung down the wicked great sword again.

Howard deflected it, and after exchanging several more strikes, they both took a step back, maintaining a certain distance to gauge each other's movements.

<b>

To an ordinary person, this exchange would have seemed like a mere blink of an eye.

In reality, from a distance, Kyle and Tony could not discern what was happening in the fight.

<b>

In that exchange, Howard's sword had indeed cut the vampire’s throat.

However, the wound had already closed.

In contrast, Howard's cheek had been gouged by the vampire's deadly blade, and blood was dripping down.

It was a minor wound, but it felt as if his magical power and stamina had been completely drained.

<b>

I see, so this is the true nature of what incapacitated Conrad and Gilbert.

Howard recalled the weapon and its wielder.

<b>

“The ‘Undead General’... was it?”

“Oh?”

The vampire adjusted the great sword on his shoulder and raised an eyebrow as if to say he knew.

<b>

“That’s the abominable ‘Corpse Creator’ that resurrects and controls the dead. It is said that he once led an army of the undead he created and destroyed a small southern kingdom in a single night. The ancient vampire, ‘Undead General Halbert’!”

“Ku ku ku...”

“The weapon he wields is the cursed sword ‘Despairbringer’ that devours human souls.”

“Ku ku ku ku... Kuha! Kuha ha ha ha!! I’m surprised! I didn’t think there would be someone in this age who knew about it! Kuha ha ha!”

<b>

The vampire began to laugh joyfully.

<b>

“...Reluctantly, I’ve come to know quite a bit about you. That sword... I thought it was just a fairy tale.”

“Kuha! That’s how it is! Those marked by it will have their souls gouged out and devoured by me! Your lives have a good flavor, Iron Demon God! Kuha ha ha ha!!”

<b>

The vampire, still shouldering the cursed sword, laughed heartily, sticking out his red tongue and licking it.

<b>

“The last record of you noted in the kingdom is from over 400 years ago. What do you intend to do by raising an army in this era?! Are you planning to conquer a kingdom?!!”

“...Conquer a kingdom, huh... I wonder about that? Kuha! More than that... Iron Demon God! I’ve been unable to move for a while... Now that I can finally move, my body is itching to rampage! Hey! You’ve gotten even stronger than before, haven’t you? Iron Demon God! You’re eager to fight, right?! Huh?! Let’s do this! Don’t you dare bore me!! Kuha ha ha ha ha ha!!!”

<b>

The vampire, still shouldering the cursed sword, glared at Howard with fierce eyes, spreading his legs and lowering his waist as if to gather strength.

<b>

“Very well, vampire! Feel free to unleash your power! But don’t underestimate this old bone! I won’t easily part with my life!”

<b>

The deadly duel, where both Howard and the vampire would chip away at each other's souls, began.

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Thank you, Jacob. I’m fine now.”

<b>

Sonia Cloud smiled as she savored the aroma of the tea brewed by Jacob Evans, the butler of Amkam House.

The deep reddish color of the tea spread small ripples, scattering amber light.

<b>

“Have August and the others returned?”

“Yes, those who have prepared are gathering at each outpost.”

<b>

After taking a sip of tea and letting out a deep, relaxed sigh, Sonia quietly asked Jacob while gazing at the glow in the teapot.

<b>

<b>

<b>

A little while ago, a small sound of glass breaking echoed through the quiet lounge.

It was the sound of a photo frame placed on the mantelpiece hitting the floor.

<b>

Sonia Cloud, who had been receiving reports from the butlers in the lounge, walked over to the mantelpiece and looked at the fallen photo frame, losing color in her face.

Something that shouldn’t have fallen had fallen, and something that shouldn’t have broken had broken.

As she looked at the portrait of Howard Cloud in the broken frame, Sonia’s complexion rapidly faded.

The vague, floating anxiety that had been present since Howard left Amkam now manifested strongly within her.

When she heard he had decided to go to Iroshio, when she saw him off, and during the week of restless days that followed, that anxiety had been there with her.

...And when she received the news that he had been attacked by a horde of undead in the depths of Iroshio, she felt a suffocating tightness in her chest.

However, even so, wouldn’t Howard return as usual, smiling? There had certainly been that hope.

But now, that slight hope felt as if it had been shattered into pieces.

In this moment, something irreparable was happening to Howard.

That was undoubtedly the certainty Sonia felt.

<b>

About 30 minutes ago, Jacob, the butler, supported Sonia, who was about to collapse, and helped her sit on the sofa.

<b>

Now, the color that had drained from her face had returned slightly, and Jacob’s eyes, which were caring for Sonia, showed a gentle hue of relief.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“It seems that the heads of the households who have gone to various villages have been informed via pigeon to remain on guard without returning to Amkam.”

“That’s right. Even if we secure Amkam, it would mean nothing if they overflow from elsewhere. Even if it’s an army of over ten thousand, not a single one must be allowed to pass through the forest.”

“Indeed, that’s correct.”

<b>

With Sonia regaining her composure, Jacob began to continue his report.

<b>

“So, where is the representative of the envoy now?”

“Yes, we just received word that they left Cooptown a short while ago.”

“...I see, then let’s wait for them around Masomu. The representative must fulfill their responsibility...”

“Should we keep the two suspicious individuals under the Bylos family’s custody?”

“Yes, I leave it to you. Please let them know they can use them as they see fit. Also, there was someone who managed to escape from the mansion... They seem to be quite skilled, so please assign companions of 7th rank or higher.”

“Understood.”

<b>

Sonia placed the teapot back on the table and turned her gaze toward Jacob as if to ask another question.

<b>

“How are Elrose and the others preparing?”

“Yes, it seems they are progressing smoothly with the ladies in the square in front of the first outpost. The ingredients were also sent from here just a while ago.”

“I see, thank you, Jacob. I should be heading there soon as well. It wouldn’t be right to keep Melber and Jane waiting too long.”

<b>

As she said this, Sonia stood up and shifted her gaze to the table.

There lay the family photos that had been moved from the mantelpiece to the table.

In addition to Howard's broken photo frame, there were her own, Suzy's, and Lavinia's.

All the family photos were lined up on the table, and she gazed at them with a soft expression.

<b>

Sonia thought... No matter what situation Howard finds himself in, if it is his fate to return, he will surely come back to her.

However, if there is a fate that leads him to sink into that, and if Howard chooses it, Sonia will accept it.

Whether she can come to terms with it or not, that fact cannot be changed.

If that’s the case, she will endure it all.

Because she is a woman of Amkam and the wife of Howard Cloud!

But even so...

<b>

“Lavi, please protect father... Suzy, I’m counting on you for Howard...!”

<b>

Sonia held the photos of her two daughters close to her chest, quietly and powerfully praying.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The heavy metallic sounds of sword strikes echoed through the forest like an echo.

It had been several hours since the battle with the vampire had begun.

<b>

The armor, which could easily withstand the fangs of high-level magical beasts, had been slashed in various places.

The ‘Despairbringer,’ said to devour souls, had certainly dealt significant damage to Howard's armor.

<b>

With this many wounds, he couldn’t hide his exhaustion. Breathing heavily, he could no longer pretend otherwise.

<b>

In contrast, the vampire, even with minor wounds, healed almost instantly.

Howard had likely dealt several fatal blows, but the result was the same. The vampire quickly returned to his original state.

It was truly a hopeless match! A bitter smile escaped him.

<b>

In any case, the depletion of his stamina and magical power was severe. There was no denying that he was in a dire situation.

This opponent was not someone he could handle by holding back.

The only path left was to unleash all his power and confront him!

Let him taste my trump card!

<b>

Without a control orb, Howard's armor could be used without suppressing the wearer’s magical power.

While an inexperienced user would quickly deplete their magical power, once he grasped the technique, he could freely control the flow of power.

<b>

When unleashing a large technique, he temporarily used the magical power stored in the armor.

Otherwise, every time he used a technique, it would endlessly consume the wearer's magical power.

<b>

‘First Strike’ and ‘Second Strike’ are techniques that use stored magical power.

However, ‘Third Strike’ is a blow that not only uses stored magical power but also greatly drains the wearer’s magical power.

<b>

It is a double-edged sword that consumes the user’s own life force.

<b>

Heh, I never expected...

To meet such an enemy at the end of my life...

Life is truly unpredictable.

But knowing there are those to carry on after me allows me to move forward without worry.

As long as that child is there, I have nothing to fear!

...I’m sorry, Sonia. It seems I won’t be able to return this time.

<b>

<b>

The vampire continued to bare his fangs and grin, skillfully manipulating the cursed sword.

As he parried the vampire's sword strikes, Howard quietly heightened his magical power and infused it into his armor.

<b>

His armor, ‘Ultimate Ouroboros,’ is a magical armor composed of three layers made from magical beast leather and magic steel.

Each of those three layers is inscribed with enhanced magical sigils.

Now, he was infusing magical power into the sigils of the first two layers, but it was still insufficient against this opponent.

However, if he were to unleash the sigils of all three layers, he could expect a significant increase in combat power, but the cost in magical power would be far greater than before.

Though he could control it himself, it would be almost equivalent to shattering the control orbs of the other armors.

<b>

And this was also a necessary process to supplement the magical power needed to unleash ‘Third Strike.’

<b>

Without hesitation, he opened the path to the third magical sigil.

The light of the double sigils transformed into a triple glow, increasing in brilliance.

In an instant, he stepped into the enemy's range and swung down with all his might.

The vampire instinctively received it with his cursed sword, but his feet couldn’t withstand the weight of the blow and sank into the ground, creating a dent.

Continuing with a series of sword strikes, the vampire skillfully parried them.

<b>

With a slash upward, Howard severed the vampire’s left forearm, but it instantly reattached and healed.

In the next moment, the vampire’s blade pierced Howard’s side.

Howard kicked the vampire’s abdomen, creating distance, but the vampire quickly closed the gap with a force that shattered the ground and delivered a follow-up strike.

<b>

After exchanging several more blows, Howard deflected the blade that was swung down at him upward.

In the brief opening in the vampire's guard, he poured all his spirit into a single strike.

And then, he unleashed all the condensed magical power toward that one point.

<b>

‘Erase Blade’

Three magical lines extending from the shoulder of his armor converged instantaneously into the Grand Divider and were explosively released.

<b>

Once this was unleashed, Howard would be reduced to nothing more than a husk.

If he missed, that would be it.

Even if he could endure it, there would be no next time.

This was truly a desperate strike.

<b>

“Farewell, my wife, my daughters!”

<b>

Receive my final and greatest strike in this lifetime!
