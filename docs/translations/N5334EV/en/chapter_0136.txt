Something quiet

Thank you for your service, Miss Byros.

<blank>

This is Mrs. Sheldon, thank you for your time.

<blank>

Work seems to be going well at ......."

<blank>

Yes, I think we're almost there.

<blank>

That's a big deal. Have you reported back to the chancellor?"

<blank>

We'll keep you posted."

<blank>

Thank you again for your efforts. It is a very sad fact for our traditional school, but it seems to have been worth your visit.

<blank>

Thank you.

<blank>

The chairman had hoped to have it all done by the end of the year, before the Kiwanis Festival in the sixth month of the lunar calendar, but it looks like it will be sooner than he expected.

<blank>

Yes, I think we can have it done by next month at the earliest.

<blank>

Quintessential AnnaMarie Byros."

<blank>

Thank you very much. Sometimes, I think it is related to the festival of the shimmering sun, but I see an unnatural trend here as well."

<blank>

"......, well, can you follow that too?"

<blank>

I know this is a separate line, but we are already working on it. If you could give us a few moments of your time."

<blank>

I understand. I'll be counting on you."

<blank>

It was a little surprising ...... to find out that the school had so many smoldering problems."

<blank>

The other side is that there are some aspects that can't be stopped. ......, well, it's a headache for the past chancellor. You know that, don't you?"

<blank>

I see. I certainly don't expect it to disappear anytime soon.

<blank>

But fortunately or unfortunately, you are here now. The chancellor seems to think that this is an opportunity to greatly reduce our power.

<blank>

Certainly, if your daughter were here today, small insects would be nothing more than a speck of dust.

<blank>

Please don't cause any trouble. Remember to keep it to a minimum."

<blank>

"I know what I'm doing, Mrs. Sheldon. You can count on me."

<blank>

I feel like I've seen you sulk and cause trouble a lot in the past, haven't I?"

<blank>

Don't worry, Mrs. Sheldon. I'll see to it right away by dedicating two letters to the name of 'resolution'."

<blank>

I miss ......." I heard that line a lot too. ...... haha."

<blank>

Are you tired, Mrs. Sheldon? Mrs. Sheldon."

<blank>

Yes, thanks somewhat to ....... Well, I'm going back. You, too, should go back to your room in the dormitory today. You will not get a good result if you are too hard-pressed."

<blank>

I will leave today when I have finished these papers."

<blank>

That would be good. Well, AnnaMary, have a good day."

<blank>

"Yes, good day, Mrs. Sheldon."

<blank>

<blank>

Well, you'd better hurry, I promised to give you your first massage in a long time today."

I need to finish cleaning up quickly and take the young lady to the spa room that I got permission to use last week."

It's been a long time since I've had a massage. I'm sure your daughter has been eagerly awaiting today's appointment."

Oh, miss. Please wait a moment. I, AnnaMarie, will heal you immediately with all my might! Oh, it's been so long! It's been so long! My Lady! Just thinking about how much pleasure I can give you today ...... makes me smile! ............
