# Chapter 124: Annemarie's Work

A brief interlude

----------------

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work, Miss Bylos."

<b>

"This is Mrs. Sheldon, thank you for your efforts."

<b>

"How is the work... going smoothly, it seems?"

<b>

"Yes, I believe we are generally on track."

<b>

"That's excellent. What about the report to the chairman?"

<b>

"I have been providing updates as necessary."

<b>

"Thank you again for your hard work. It is indeed a regrettable fact for our traditional academy, but it seems your presence has been worthwhile."

<b>

"I am honored."

<b>

"The chairman was hoping to have everything settled by the Kōyō Festival scheduled for the sixth of the Red Moon at the end of the year, but it seems we may finish sooner than expected."

<b>

"Yes, if all goes well, we should be able to wrap things up by next month."

<b>

"Impressive, Annemarie Bylos."

<b>

"Thank you. By the way, it seems there is an unnatural flow related to the Kōyō Festival here as well."

<b>

"...Is that so? Can you investigate that too?"

<b>

"It appears to be a separate matter, but we are already looking into it. If you could give us a little time..."

<b>

"Understood. I will leave it to you."

<b>

"Still, I was a bit surprised to find that the academy was harboring so many smoldering issues..."

<b>

"Some aspects are unavoidable, but... well, it's been a headache for past chairmen. You are aware of this, aren't you?"

<b>

"Ah, I see. I certainly don't expect them to disappear immediately."

<b>

"However, fortunately or unfortunately, you are here now. The chairman seems to think this is a good opportunity to significantly reduce the burden."

<b>

"Indeed, with the young lady present, even the smallest nuisances are nothing more than mere dust."

<b>

"Please ensure that no major incidents occur. Remember to keep everything within the minimum necessary range."

<b>

"I understand, Mrs. Sheldon. Please leave it to us."

<b>

"Ah... I feel like I've seen you cause problems and complicate matters despite saying that many times in the past."

<b>

"Rest assured, Mrs. Sheldon. I will soon present you with the two characters that mean 'solution.'"

<b>

"...How nostalgic. I've heard that line quite often... ah."

<b>

"Are you tired, Mrs. Sheldon?"

<b>

"Yes, thanks to you, a little... Now, I must return. You should also head back to your dorm room for the day. Overworking yourself won't yield good results."

<b>

"I will finish this paperwork and then take my leave for today."

<b>

"That would be best. Well then, Annemarie, take care."

<b>

"Yes, take care, Mrs. Sheldon."

<b>

<b>

"Now, I mustn't dawdle, as I promised to give you a massage for the first time in a while."

"I need to finish up quickly and take the young lady to the spa room, for which I obtained permission last week."

"It's been a long time since the last massage. The young lady must be eagerly awaiting our appointment today."

"Ah, young lady. Please wait just a moment. Soon, this Annemarie will wholeheartedly heal you! Ah! It has truly been a while! Young lady!! I wonder how much joy you will experience today... just thinking about it makes me! ...uh, heeheehee."
