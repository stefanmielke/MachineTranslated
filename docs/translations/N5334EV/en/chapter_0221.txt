# Chapter 209: The Harvester of Despair

"Arvin! Are you okay?!!"

"I'm pretty messed up... Gah!"

"Let me see! ...This is terrible, your elbow joint... and your shoulder?!"

"I had to forcefully stop the blade at a vital point. The recoil was really bad... Ugh! My spine... feels like it's messed up in places... Ugh!"

"! ...Don't push yourself, Arvin! Lombard! Give him a hand!"

<b>

Using skills in succession and swinging an ultra-heavy two-handed sword must have put a considerable strain on his body.

Moreover, hearing Arvin's words that he had put even greater stress on his body made Beatrice gasp.

<b>

"Sorry... Lombard."

"Don't worry about it."

"I can ease the pain a bit... but I can't heal you completely! We'll ask Sareina later, or we can have Su fix you up when she arrives!"

"Ah... I wonder if Su will scold me again?"

<b>

Arvin, still leaning on Lombard, looked down at his own body and forced a wry smile.

His condition was pretty bad. If he sat down now, he wasn't confident he could stand up again.

He had been told by Su to be aware of his body's condition and approach battles accordingly.

Just the other day, he had been fighting without realizing he was afflicted by a deadly poison and had just been scolded for it.

<b>

"Su really pushes us hard during training, but she gets furious when we do something reckless in battle."

<b>

Beatrice let out a big sigh at Arvin's grumbling.

<b>

"Ugh... Just accept it and get scolded! You really should start thinking about your own body, Arvin!"

"You won't start saying, 'For a while, train like this!' will you?"

"It'll be fine! That girl always says, 'Even if your head gets chopped off, as long as you're not dead, I'll definitely heal you!' She'll fix you up!"

"That's still a scary thing to say!"

<b>

Beatrice cast a healing spell on Arvin, who was being supported by Lombard.

The injuries themselves weren't fully repaired, but it seemed the pain had subsided enough for him to joke around.

<b>

<b>

With those three behind her, Mia was staring intently at a single point without letting her guard down.

At the object called Van, which was emitting white smoke like it was smoldering.

<b>

The once robust body had withered and darkened, looking almost like a mummy.

The severed right arm had already turned to dust, and there were no signs of the wound healing.

The eyeballs had melted away, leaving black sockets.

From the lipless, exposed teeth, blood was bubbling out like foam.

The blackened, skin-covered body twitched slightly, perhaps due to reflexes.

White smoke was continuously rising from all over. It was clear to anyone that its existence would soon vanish.

<b>

However, Mia did not take her eyes off the decaying monster.

<b>

Suddenly, she felt as if that withered left arm had lifted.

Mia noticed it and focused her consciousness there.

Before she knew it, something was clenched in that hand.

It was something shaped like a silver, shining egg.

If she looked closely, she could see that the silver egg was pulsating as if it were alive.

<b>

"!"

<b>

Mia instinctively stretched both arms forward. The magic gem in her glove emitted yellow light.

In an instant, the largest "Grenade" she had ever used was launched.

<b>

With a sound that shook the surroundings, it flew straight toward the silver egg and exploded with a loud noise upon impact.

Startled by the explosion, Beatrice and the others widened their eyes.

<b>

"Mia?!"

"Not yet!"

<b>

The smoke from the explosion quickly dispersed.

However, both the silver egg that should have been hit and the withered arm holding it remained unscathed.

<b>

"Tch!"

<b>

Magic power gathered in Mia's hand once more.

One after another, "Grenades" were generated around her outstretched arm.

They were fired in succession, and as they reached their target, they exploded one after another.

However, Mia noticed that the explosions were occurring before they reached their target.

Silver tentacles extended from the egg, swatting away the "Grenades."

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

The swatted "Grenades" exploded against the ground, quickly enveloping the area in dust.

<b>

In the meantime, the withered arm brought the silver egg to the torn chest.

Then, it pushed it into the opened chest cavity.

<b>

Now, the "Head of the Nightmare" raised its sickle-like head, swelling within the withered body.

In that moment, a horrifying magical power surged through the area.

<b>

"Ugh!"

"!!"

<b>

Lombard, leaving Arvin to Beatrice, jumped forward.

Mia deployed a shield and used Air Ride to retreat.

<b>

However, a shadow moved amidst the dust.

In an instant, it closed the distance and was right in front of Mia.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

A sound like air escaping escaped from Cordelia's mouth.

Karen couldn't comprehend the situation.

<b>

Cordelia's eyes widened, and her gaze shifted to her chest.

<b>

From the center of her chest, something resembling a blue stake protruded upward.

It looked like several thin skewers bundled together, about the thickness of a finger.

The skewers were soaked in red liquid, which began to seep into Cordelia's chest.

From the blue tip, red drops fell, one by one, onto the cobblestones below.

<b>

Karen's mind couldn't accept that it was blood red.

<b>

When Cordelia, who had turned her gaze back to Karen, opened her mouth as if to say something.

Suddenly, as if her support had been pulled away, her body crumpled to her knees.

At the same time, she lost consciousness, her eyes closed, and she fell limply onto the cobblestones.

<b>

The weight of Cordelia was conveyed to Karen's fingers, which were intertwined with hers.

Karen also crumbled as if all her strength had left her body, kneeling beside Cordelia.

<b>

"Eh? ...Cordy? Stop it, this is a joke... it's a joke, right?"

<b>

Blood gushed from Cordelia's mouth.

<b>

"Cordy! Huh? Why? This can't be real, right? Hey, Cordy... Cordy!!"

<b>

Before she knew it, blood was overflowing from the chest where the stake had disappeared.

It stained Cordelia's chest red, spreading outwards.

It also spread onto the cobblestones, and Karen could feel its warmth as she knelt.

<b>

"No!! No! This can't be happening!!"

<b>

Trying to stop the blood that was overflowing, Karen pressed her hand against Cordelia's chest, trying to hold it back.

<b>

"…Right! Su-chan's healing potion! If I use that…!"

<b>

Karen took a small pouch containing the healing potion from her belt and opened it upside down, spilling all the potions onto the ground.

There were a total of 12 bottles of healing potions in the small pouch that had been expanded in space.

One by one, she poured them over Cordelia's chest.

But even then, the blood wouldn't stop.

Empty bottles lay scattered around them, a testament to their futility.

<b>

"Why?! Why won't it heal?! ...But, but! It's still so warm... I have to stop it... if I can just stop the bleeding!"

<b>

She took out a white cloth for emergencies from one of the pouches and pressed it against Cordelia's chest, applying pressure with her hand on top of it.

The white cloth quickly became stained red.

However, Karen couldn't feel any pulse of life from Cordelia's body as she pressed down on her chest.

<b>

"I don't want this! No, no!! This can't be true!! It's okay! It's still okay!!"

<b>

With both hands on the center of Cordelia's chest, she leaned her weight down.

Rhythmically applying pressure as if to restore the heartbeat, but there was no response.

Only blood overflowed each time she pressed down.

<b>

"No, ah, it's overflowing... it's going to overflow... please! Cordy! Cordy!!!"

<b>

Unable to bear it, Karen lifted Cordelia's limp body.

As if trying to suppress the overflowing blood with her own body.

Cordelia's arms fell limply as she was raised.

<b>

"Ah... Ah, Cordy... No, no... Cordy! Why? Why?! Ugh... ah!"

<b>

By lifting Cordelia, Karen realized that there was no breath of life in her body.

<b>

"Ah! No... I don't want this! Cordy! Cordy!! Open your eyes! Open your eyes, Cordy!! Ah! Ugh! Ahhh! Ahhh—!! No! Noooooo—!!"

<b>

Karen's vision distorted greatly.

Her breathing became erratic, and tears flowed endlessly.

Not caring that she was getting covered in Cordelia's blood, she wrapped her arms around Cordelia's body, desperately pulling her close again and again.

Holding her head to prevent it from falling, she rubbed her cheek against Cordelia's face to check her temperature.

However, the closer she got, the more despair pierced through Karen's being.

<b>

A heart-wrenching cry, like her soul was being torn apart, erupted from the depths of Karen's throat.

<b>

"Ugh! Ah! Ahhh—! Noooooo! Ugh! Ah! Aaaaaahhh—!!"

<b>

Her chest felt as if it had been brutally sliced open.

Breathing was difficult, and her heart raced violently.

Her whole body was burning hot, yet she was trembling violently.

Her vision turned a deep red.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Karen's left ankle glowed a bright red.

It pulsed strongly, as if in sync with her heartbeat.

It was a sinister, poisonous red light.

<b>

With each heartbeat, the red light grew larger, and soon several thin strands extended from it.

Like veins surfacing, it pulsed and traveled up her leg from her ankle.

<b>

The vein-like red light quickly spread throughout her body.

Pulsating red-black veins extended to her arms and face.

As if applying a sinister makeup, red-black lines were etched into her cheeks and around her eyes.

It looked as if she were shedding blood tears without stopping.

Eventually, the ominous red-black light gathered at Karen's chest.

<b>

At her chest, there was a small, shining red object separate from the others.

It emitted a pure light, the opposite of the malevolent light that was trying to engulf her, protecting its bearer.

<b>

However, the poisonous red light began to converge around it.

As if to invade. To envelop.

The pure light intensified in resistance.

But the red-black light would not allow it, advancing its invasion like waves crashing in.

Even so, the small light blinked defiantly against the encroaching filth.

<b>

But finally, the small red flame was violated and sealed by the red-black light.

<b>

"Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh—!!"

<b>

Karen's chest surged violently, and her body arched backward.

A scream like a death throe burst forth from her throat.

<b>

As her body was engulfed in red-black light, it fell backward like a lifeless object.

<b>

However, just before her body slammed against the cobblestones, someone was there to support her back.

<b>

"Ugh... Finally, it has sprouted."

<b>

A blue woman emerged from the shadows, her mouth curling into a sinister smile as she whispered in a sultry voice.
