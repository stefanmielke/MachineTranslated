# 209 Episode 209 Harvesters of Despair

Irving!　Are you okay?

"Pretty bad. ....... Ggh!"

'Let me see!　...... terrible, my elbow joints are ...... terrible, and my shoulders too?!"

'Because I forced the blade to stop at the kryptonite position. The recoil was pretty bad. ......　The spine seems to be ...... coming apart in places too. ...... ouch!"

"!　...... Take it easy Irving!　Lombard!　Give me a hand!

<blank>

The physical burden of using the skill continuously and wielding a super-heavy two-handed sword must have been considerable.

And on top of that, Irving's words about putting an even greater load on the body made Beatrice gasp.

<blank>

"Woah, ......, Ron."

Don't worry about it."

I can help you with the pain, but I can't ...... cure you completely!　I'll ask Salaina to help you later or have Sue heal you when she gets here!"

"Oh--....... Do you think Suzy will be able to doyaship me?"

<blank>

Irving looked down at his own body with Lombardo on his shoulder and chuckled.

The condition is pretty much in shambles. If I sit down now, I am not confident I can get up again.

Suzy usually told me to know my physical condition and take on the battle.

Just the other day, I was scolded for fighting it without realizing that I was being raped by a deadly poison.

<blank>

Suzy, you make me do things in training that are too much for me, and then you get mad when I do something crazy in battle."

<blank>

Beatrice sighs heavily at Irving's blurting out.

<blank>

You can find out more at ....... You should be scolded!　Irving better start thinking about his own body for a change!"

"You're not going to say, 'Keep practicing like this for a while! You're not going to say, 'Keep practicing for a while!' are you?"

I'm sure she'll be fine!　She usually says, 'Even if you get your head blown off, if you're not dead, I'll heal you! She'll heal you if you're not dead!　She'll heal you!"

That's a scary thing to say, though!"

<blank>

Beatrice uses her healing magic on Irving, who is supported by Lombardo.

The injury itself is not repairable, but the pain seems to have subsided enough to allow light talk.

<blank>

<blank>

With the three of them at her back, Mia was alone, staring at a point without letting her guard down.

The object called a van, which emits white smoke as if smoldering.

<blank>

His body, which used to be strong and strong, has become so thin and black that it looks as if it were a mummy.

The right arm that was cut off has already turned to dust, and there is no sign that the wound will be repaired.

The eyeballs have melted away and the eye sockets are open like black holes.

Gobbing and gurgling blood bubbled out from between his bare, lipless teeth.

The blackened, skin-only body moves in a jittery, fine motion, perhaps as a reflex.

White smoke is rising incessantly from his entire body. It is obvious to anyone who sees it that it will soon cease to exist.

<blank>

Mia, however, does not avert her gaze from the decaying demon.

<blank>

Suddenly, I felt that dried-up left arm lifted.

Mia notices it and turns her attention to it.

Before I knew it, there was something in his hand.

It is a silvery egg-shaped object.

If you looked closely, you could see that the silver egg was pulsating like a living creature.

<blank>

!"

<blank>

Mia quickly stretched her arms out in front of her. The magic beads on her gloves spilled yellow light.

At that moment, a grenade, one of the largest grenades ever used, was shot out.

<blank>

With a bursting sound that shook the area, it flew straight for the silver egg and exploded with a loud bang as soon as it reached it.

The explosion startled Beatrice and the other three, and their eyes widened.

<blank>

Mia?

Not yet!"

<blank>

Immediately the burst of smoke dissipates and disappears.

However, the silver egg that should have hit the target and the dried-up arm holding it were still there, unharmed.

<blank>

Tsk!"

<blank>

Once again, magic gathers in Mia's hands.

Around the outstretched arm, "grenades" are generated one after another.

It is shot out in succession, and when it reaches its target, it causes a series of explosions.

However, Mia notices that the explosion occurs before the target is reached.

<blank>

Silver tentacles extended from the eggs, beating away the "grenades" one after the other.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

The "grenade" that had been knocked out exploded on the ground in the area, and suddenly the whole area was enveloped in a cloud of dust and smoke.

<blank>

Meanwhile, a dried-up arm carries a silver egg to a ripped chest.

He then pushed the sole into the cut open chest.

<blank>

Now the "head of the nightmare" is rising from its scythe and swelling up inside the dried up body.

At that moment, a fearless magical power blew around the area at once.

<blank>

Crap!"

""!!!""

<blank>

Immediately, Lombardo leaps forward, leaving Irving in the hands of Beatrice.

Mia deployed her shield and used the air ride to move backward.

<blank>

But a shadow moves among the clouds of dust.

It was in the distance in an instant and was right on Mia's doorstep.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

An airy sound escaped from Cordelia's mouth.

Karen does not understand the situation.

<blank>

Cordilia's eyes widen and her gaze shifts to her own chest.

<blank>

Something like a blue stake protruded from the center of its chest.

It looks like several finger-thin skewers.

The skewer is coated in a red liquid, which smears and spreads across Cordelia's chest.

One or two red drops fall from the blue tip and strike the cobblestone pavement underfoot.

<blank>

Karen's brain cannot accept that it is blood red.

<blank>

Cordelia, who had turned her attention back to Karen, was about to open her mouth to say something.

Suddenly, as if the support had been pulled out from under him, his body collapsed to the ground from the knees.

At the same time, he loses consciousness, his eyes close, and he collapses onto the cobblestone pavement as if thrown down without effort.

<blank>

The weight of Cordelia is felt in Karen's linked fingers.

Karen also crumpled, as if her entire body had been drained, and fell to her knees beside Cordelia's body.

<blank>

Yeah?"　...... Cody?　Stop, I'm joking ...... I'm joking ...... right?"

<blank>

Blood poured from Gobori and Cordilia's mouth.

<blank>

Cody!　What?　Why?　You're lying, right?　Hey, Cody ...... Cody!"

<blank>

Before long, the stake disappears from the chest, and the chest is flooded with blood later.

It makes Cordelia's chest turn red and big.

It spread across the cobblestones, and its warmth was felt by Karen as she kneeled.

<blank>

No!　No!　No, not like this!"

<blank>

To stop the blood from pouring out, Karen puts her hand on Cordelia's chest and holds it down to try to hold it back.

<blank>

...... Yes, that's right!　Sue's wound medicine!　Use that ...... that!"

<blank>

Karen removed the small pouch of wound medication from her waist belt, opened its mouth and turned it upside down, dumping all the pills inside onto the ground.

There were a total of 12 wound medicines in the small pouch in which the space expansion was used.

He pours it over Cordelia's chest one after the other.

But still the bleeding does not stop.

Several empty bottles roll around them, empty.

<blank>

Why?　Why can't I get better?　...... but!　It's still so warm....... We have to stop it,...... if we can stop the blood!"

<blank>

He also takes a first-aid white cloth from one of the pouches on his waist and presses it against Cordelia's chest to stop the bleeding, then presses his hand down further on top of it.

The white fabric is dyed red as you look at it.

But Karen's hands, which restrain her chest, cannot feel the pulse of life from Cordelia's body.

<blank>

No. No!　No, no, no!　No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!　It's okay!　I'm still okay!

<blank>

Put your hands on the center of Cordelia's chest and go with your weight with your arms outstretched.

I put my weight on it rhythmically, as if to get my heart beating again, but there is no response that comes back.

But every time I press on my chest, blood just flows out.

<blank>

"No, ah, overflowing ...... overflowing ....... No, no, no. ...... please!　Cody!　Cody!

<blank>

Cordelia was lying on her side, and Karen couldn't help but pick her up.

It was as if he was trying to contain the overflowing blood with his own body.

Cordelia's arms hang limply as her body is raised.

<blank>

Oh, ...... Oh, Cody ....... Oh, no, I don't want to ...... Cody!　Why?　Why?　Oh, ......, oh!

<blank>

By holding up Cordelia, Karen understands that there is no breath of the living in her body.

<blank>

Aa!　Iya ...... don't like it!　Cody!　Cody!　Eyes!　Open your eyes, Cody!　Aah!　Aaaaah!　Aaaaah! ----!　Yeeee!　Noaaaaaaaaaaa-------- --Aaahhh!

<blank>

Karen's vision is greatly distorted.

My breathing is very erratic and my tears flow uncontrollably.

He puts his arms around Cordilia, who is about to collapse on the cobblestones, and holds her back again and again in frustration, willing to be smeared with Cordilia's spilled blood.

I held his head as he tried to collapse and rubbed my cheek against his face as if to check his body heat.

But the closer they huddle, the more despair perforates Karen's body.

<blank>

Karen's throat is filled with a wailing, wrenching lamentation.

<blank>

Oh!　Ahh!　Aaah--!　Oh no!　Aaah!　Aaah!　Aaaaahhhh! -------- Aa--!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<blank>

My heart ached as if it had been cut open in a mess.

His breathing is ragged and his heart palpitations are so severe that they break his throat.

His whole body was burning hot, but his body was shaking badly.

The vision turns bright red.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Karen's left ankle glowed red.

It pulsates powerfully to match the beat of her heart.

It is a venomous red light with a hint of mischief in it.

<blank>

The red light grew with each beat, and soon several thin streaks of red light were seen growing out of it.

It pulsates loudly and climbs up through the ankle and down the leg, as if it were a floating blood vessel.

<blank>

The veiny red light spread throughout his body as he watched.

A pulsating reddish-black vein-like light extends to his arms and face.

As if to apply a disastrous makeup, reddish-black streaks are carved on the cheeks and around the eyes.

It seems as if it is shedding tears of blood without stopping.

Soon the disastrous reddish-black light gathered around Karen's chest.

<blank>

On Karen's chest was a small red shiny object separate from them.

It is a small radiance that protects those equipped with it, emitting a clean light that is the exact opposite of the disastrous light that now threatens to consume their entire body.

<blank>

However, the poisonous red converges to surround it.

As if encroaching. As if encompassing.

The clean shine intensified as if resisting it.

However, the reddish-black light does not allow it, and the erosion proceeds like a surging wave.

Still, a small light blinks and resists the approaching stain.

<blank>

But finally the little red light was raped and closed by a reddish-black light.

<blank>

'Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh -------- ------ggg！！！！"

<blank>

Karen's chest jumped violently, and her body was turned up wide.

A desperate cry gushes from the back of my throat.

<blank>

As it was, Karen's body, her entire body dyed reddish-black, fell right back like an ornament.

<blank>

However, just before its body slammed into the cobblestones, there was someone who put his hand on its back to support it.

<blank>

"Oof. ....... Finally, it sprouted."

<blank>

A blue woman appeared out of the shadows, her mouth agape with mischief, and she muttered in a glamorous voice.
