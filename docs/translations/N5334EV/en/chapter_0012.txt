# 12 Howard Cloud is very surprised.

A new chapter is starting. And finally, it's a human village ^^;


----------------

<blank>

Howard Cloud was depressed.

<blank>

<blank>

Now Howard is steering a one-horse cart pulled by a black horse, making his way home.

<blank>

He wears a black sun hat and jacket with a white shirt, gray head hair and mustache peeking out of the hat, and his posture as he steers the carriage is straight and unlevel.

His appearance and appearance alone seem to reveal that he is an honest man.

<blank>

Behind the dark eyebrows stand strong gray eyes.

But it is by no means intimidating.

It has a warmth that is rather familiar.

He is looking thoughtful with a slightly twisted mouth buried in his beard.

<blank>

Normally, this carriage would have carried my nephew Will, who was on his way back to our home in Amkham.

But what awaited Howard at the stagecoach stop was a letter handed to him by the governor.

<blank>

It was from my nephew, who was really unable to take time off due to a sudden exam.

It was filled with polite apologies for not keeping my promise and words of exertion for my aunt and uncle.

<blank>

<blank>

Will, the son of Howard's brother Philip, is a vivacious young man, 17 this year, a sophomore at a high school in DeKembel, one of the 12 cities.

<blank>

He comes to visit Amcam for a week each summer and spends time with the Cloud family.

<blank>

For the Claudes, who have no children, Will's visit is an event they look forward to every year.

After entering a boarding school, he was scheduled to come here at the beginning of the summer vacation.

<blank>

How could I comfort my wife Sonia? I was looking forward to it so much.

For a week, he and his maid, Elrose, had been happily preparing for the event.

I can see the disappointment in their eyes.

<blank>

Howard was sighing thoughtfully as he drove his carriage homeward.

<blank>

<blank>

The suddenness of the exam at this time of the year is also understandable.

Nine times out of ten, it is probably related to the anomaly in the Deipala Mountains.

<blank>

Sacred Daypara, where the gods are said to dwell.

It was two days ago that something unusual happened there.

<blank>

Some say the mountains shone.

Numerous witnesses claim to have seen the flashes.

Then the clouds scraped away and the atmosphere trembled.

Atmospheric vibrations are experienced by everyone in this village.

<blank>

And the mountains changed shape. Even the tops of Mother Dare had been carved away and greatly transformed.

<blank>

Some are calling this the wrath of the gods or the resurrection of the evil gods.

<blank>

In any case, the impact on various regions is immeasurable.

Perhaps a survey team will be formed.

The organization of personnel is an urgent task.

<blank>

Also, the mountain range of the gods has changed. There will be those who deceive people's minds, and there could be the activation of demonic beasts in various places.

Security against them also needs to be strengthened.

Inevitably, there will be a shortage of labor.

<blank>

Will is an excellent knight candidate student.

The on-the-job training, which is called an examination, will probably be conducted to fill the vacancies left by the allocated personnel.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard was thinking about this now as he passed by a side road in the Amcam forest.

<blank>

<blank>

Amcam Forest.

It is the end of this country that stretches to the north of the village of Amkam.

<blank>

The forest that bears the name of this village is actually a part of the southern edge of the Irosio Great Forest.

<blank>

If there was something wrong in the Deipala Mountains, it is not surprising that the Irosio Forest, which spreads out at the foot of the mountains, was also affected in some way.

For those who live in this village, the vigilance of the Amkamu forest is one of the most important matters as it is part of their daily life.

<blank>

Besides, there is no one in the country who knows this forest better than the people of this village.

<blank>

<blank>

(If a full-scale survey team heads for the Irosio Great Forest, we will have to allocate personnel from this village as well. (If a full-scale survey team heads for the Great Forest of Irosio, we will have to allocate personnel from this village. But we will still have to go as far as we can.)

<blank>

<blank>

Howard contemplates as he drives the carriage.

<blank>

Now Howard was moving westward on a side road with the Amcam forest to his right.

A protective fence made of thick logs is set up at the edge of the forest to enclose it.

The road was built along that fence.

Although it was not necessary to take this road, I wanted to check the current state of the forest.

<blank>

To tell you the truth, I chose to take the long way around when I thought about when I would tell my wife about Will....

<blank>

Suddenly, I felt something different in the forest to my right.

<blank>

The village is the guardian of the Amkam forest and also manages it.

There are no demonic beasts from the edge of the forest to about 2 to 300 meters deep, at first.

<blank>

This is because the villagers are always on the alert, and if a magical beast is discovered, it is quickly dealt with.

<blank>

A weak demonic beast that makes its home on the periphery of the forest can be dealt with by village children with no problem.

<blank>

Occasionally, there are more powerful demonic beasts that come up from the depths, but when that happens, the village's protectorate takes care of the matter.

<blank>

In terms of pure combat power alone, the Protectorate is no match for the Knights of the Royal City.

<blank>

Rather, those at the higher levels would even surpass the Knights.

<blank>

Now, an unusual presence was drifting in from the forest.

Since the Daypara anomaly, the village has raised the alert level of the forest.

<blank>

Even now, many villagers are patrolling in and out of the forest, keeping a watchful eye on things, and if there is anything out of the ordinary, an alarm should immediately sound in the village.

<blank>

<blank>

（Maybe something slipped through the net.)

<blank>

<blank>

Howard stopped the carriage in alarm.

Just before the fence breaks and the path extends into the woods at a crossroads.

He placed his sunshade hat on the seat and got out of the carriage with his beloved sword in hand.

<blank>

He tells the horses to stay where they are and stops the wheels of the carriage.

The horse, named Regulus, has been with us for more than 20 years now.

<blank>

He must be quite old for a person his age.

I think as I stroke the fine scratches on the scales of his paws.

<blank>

The horse, which had been with Howard for a long time and was exceptionally smart, made eye contact with Howard's words and began to graze on the grass at his feet.

<blank>

<blank>

(If I leave the wagon here, someone on patrol will soon find it and realize that I entered the forest from here. It would be quicker if August found me.)

<blank>

<blank>

With this in mind, Howard enters the forest with his beloved sword at his waist.

<blank>

This path leads into the forest for about 100 meters to a small clearing.

The villagers had cleared the area in a circle with a radius of about 10 meters.

<blank>

This is the relay point when they are on alert in the forest, or in some cases, as a battle point, battles with demonic beasts take place.

<blank>

These places are everywhere in the forest.

A road extended from here to the east and west, and a plaza similar to this place was built at the end of the road.

They are spread out in the forest like an ant's nest, every 500 meters to 1 kilometer.

<blank>

Howard stepped into the square.

<blank>

<blank>

（Well, thankfully they didn't attack me on the way here, but I guess that means they're watching us, too. Hmmm...3, or is there 4? No, there's something unusual about the presence. It's clearly different from that of a small fish...!)

<blank>

<blank>

It's almost noon, the sun is high and the sun is shining brightly.

But the forests of Amkam are deep.

There are many places where the sun does not reach even at this hour.

However, there is ample sunlight in this plaza.

<blank>

Therefore, the shadows of the trees make it even more difficult to see what is behind them.

<blank>

I know there is something moving, and there is also the sound of something heavy being dragged along.

Two pairs of red eyes glow.

Another pair nearby.

There is another pair a little further away, and another pair beside them.

<blank>

<blank>

(Noooo...four of them...no? No!)

<blank>

<blank>

One of them slowly emerges into the square.

It's a giant snake with red eyes.

The neck circumference is about 50 cm in diameter? It looks like it could swallow an adult as it is.

Another head with its thick neck. It is split off from the torso and protrudes.

Two Head Boa" is the name of this magical beast.

<blank>

The body supporting the two necks is thick and flat.

It is about two meters long, with a thin tail extending about one meter from its thick body.

At the tip of it protruded a venomous yellow thorn, clearly a poisonous needle.

<blank>

<blank>

（I'm out! This is not good. Two Head Boa" is a magical beast that lives deeper than the middle layer. It's too much for the young guys to handle in the shallow layer. Even I am in a bad situation with my current equipment. But if the kids run into one, we can't take back what we lost!)

<blank>

<blank>

He puts his hand on the sword at his waist.

It's a longsword that I've used for years.

We are confident that we can compete with our mid-tier opponents.

<blank>

But the "two-headed bore" is tricky.

Two heads with ravenous fangs attack separately in coordination.

If a human being is exposed to its poison, he or she will die in less than half an hour.

<blank>

And then there's the poisonous stinger in the tail, which attacks from the other direction when you're focused on the head.

The poison is not immediately lethal, but it causes paralysis and deprives the body of its freedom.

It is not something to be taken lightly.

<blank>

<blank>

In effect, the battle with the "two-headed boa" is the same as a three-on-one fight.

They are not so naive that they can be defeated without being attacked at all.

We need armor that can shrug off the poisonous fangs.

<blank>

That's two of them. This is like a six-on-one fight.

Essentially, the right thing to do in this situation would be to flee immediately.

A head-on battle is insane.

<blank>

But Howard took off his jacket and drew his longsword.

<blank>

<blank>

(It's not like they're going to let us go anyway...)

<blank>

<blank>

Another boa appeared a short distance away into the plaza.

The double-headed one spreads out to the left and right, blocking the way, and comes at you from both sides as if to pinch you.

<blank>

Then we must do it.

<blank>

and poised his longsword as if he were carrying it on his shoulder, and then he sat back down.

<blank>

Move before you get caught in the middle!

<blank>

Kick the ground and in one breath, enter the bore on the right side, in time for the first one to appear.

<blank>

The longsword was brought down vigorously right in front of the right neck and slashed directly to the left side.

The blade sharply slashed the left side of the neck at the throat.

<blank>

It was not severed, but the weight of the neck caused it to buckle backwards and nearly shredded it.

He continued to rotate his body and went around the back of the boa from the side of the shredded neck.

<blank>

Without killing the momentum, he swung his longsword and slammed it into the base of the poison needle.

The remaining head turns its head to the back side in pain and anger at having its tail severed.

<blank>

But Howard doesn't waste any time, swinging his longsword horizontally from the left side.

This time the boa's head fell clean off.

<blank>

The series of actions were fluidly executed in the blink of an eye.

<blank>

<blank>

The other boa followed immediately after Howard moved and tried to attack him from behind, but was unable to attack him because he was immediately behind the first one.

<blank>

Now he is alert and angry, opening his mouth to show his fangs and making menacing noises, keeping time with Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

(Well, I say we're even!)

<blank>

<blank>

Turn a desperate situation upside down.

It's really painful.

My mouth hangs open.

He measures the distance around the bore by turning the tip of his longsword with his right and left hand.

<blank>

And then something moved at the edge of my vision.

I saw something pop out from behind a tree to my left.

The Grey Wolf.

It is a large, dark-gray wolf monster with long spines on its back.

This guy is supposed to be in the middle tier or above.

<blank>

<blank>

(Oh, no! I misjudged the signs! I knew there were three of them!)

<blank>

<blank>

Gray Wolf jumped straight at Howard's neck.

Its body is over two meters long.

<blank>

Even a physical hit is fatal.

Howard quickly falls over and ducks, but his claws gouge his left bicep through the top of his shirt.

Gray wolf claws are also hard and vicious.

<blank>

He swung his longsword under Wolf's body as he fell over the body.

The blade slices straight across the wolf's belly, spilling its guts.

Just before my back touched the ground, I felt something close to my feet.

<blank>

I tried to duck, but I was too late, and I felt a gouge in the flesh above my left ankle.

<blank>

Ggh!"

<blank>

As soon as his body hit the ground, he rolled his body to distance himself from the boa and immediately raised himself up.

<blank>

The boa's poisonous needle had attacked Howard's left leg.

<blank>

<blank>

（What's even? You careless bastard! I'm on a roll!)

<blank>

<blank>

He reprimands himself for not being alert to his surroundings.

I already have no feeling from the left shin down.

<blank>

<blank>

(It's hard to say "while avoiding...". (It is difficult to say "while avoiding...", because the force of the blow may not be enough and it is impossible to avoid. Then let's give him a fatal blow. We can't let this thing go out unscathed!)

<blank>

<blank>

Howard sits down on the spot, holds his longsword to the left so that the tip of the longsword is on the ground, and gathers his strength.

I can hardly feel my left arm, and I sharpened all my nerves in order to swing the longsword with my body as it is.

<blank>

Now that the prey has stopped moving, the boa is ready to finish it off at once.

It opened its two-headed mouth and pointed it at Howard, closing the distance at once to thrust its venomous fangs into him.

<blank>

Howard's muscles creak, and he sinks deeper to measure the moment of release.

<blank>

However, he is dragged down by his left leg, which has lost all sensation, and his position is slightly disoriented.

<blank>

Boa leaped at him, but Howard was slow to make the initial move.

<blank>

<blank>

One step before the boa's fangs reach Howard.

Suddenly, a spear was thrust between them.

Boa was startled by something stuck in the tip of his nose and was momentarily frightened.

<blank>

<blank>

(Spear? No, a branch? This is a branch!)

<blank>

<blank>

Not missing that scare, Howard unleashes his power.

Aim for the bottom of the neck, where this guy's heart is.

The longsword is unleashed and powerfully cleaved horizontally.

<blank>

Both of the branches and the boa's torso were cut in two.

<blank>

The body, split in two, writhes and thrashes about in agony, but the heartless body soon stops moving.

<blank>

Howard ran out of strength and collapsed in place.

The love sword also left his hand and fell to the side as if lined up.

<blank>

<blank>

(Oh no, I have to comfort Sonia. I shouldn't be lying here... but I can't feel my lower half anymore...)

<blank>

<blank>

I was lying on my back, soaking up the sunlight, looking at the blue sky and thinking about that... but...

<blank>

Suddenly, I felt something move above my head.

I was momentarily alarmed that he was still there, but it appeared to be a person.

The person came up to Howard, kneeled down, brought his face close to Howard's, and called out to him.

<blank>

"Are you sure...?"

<blank>

Howard's breath caught for a moment as the figure entered his vision.

<blank>

For a moment, I thought I saw someone overlapping with that shadow looking up.

<blank>

(...! Oh no! Lavi? No way?)

<blank>

But I reminded myself that there is no such thing.

<blank>

The momentary illusion vanished and I saw the girl there.

A girl with bright, shiny red hair peeks out with cobalt green eyes that shimmer like crystal and asks anxiously, "What's going on?

<blank>

It's a clear, gentle, lovely voice.

<blank>

The girl's attire is something you don't see around here.

It is torn and stained here and there, as if it had wandered in the woods.

The same goes for his arms and legs, and his face is very dirty.

<blank>

<blank>

(A beautiful girl, poor thing, ruined... a stray?)

<blank>

<blank>

The girl then put her hand behind Howard's head.

<blank>

Hikage... I'm coming... now.

<blank>

Then he pulled his body closer.

<blank>

Howard panics when he realizes that he is about to hug himself.

<blank>

Wait a minute, you can't be alone..."

<blank>

Howard is 195 cm tall.

He is 62 this year, but he has never neglected his daily workout, and his body is still covered with muscles.

It is not something that a very small girl alone can lift.

<blank>

But Howard's concern is not taken into account, as the girl picks him up without hesitation.

Howard's eyes widen in surprise. He is speechless.

Noticing Howard's gaze, the girl tilts her head and looks back at him with a curious expression.

<blank>

Tottot and lightly carry Howard and lay him gently in the shade.

<blank>

Ken... I'll get it... now.

<blank>

With that, he left Howard and went back to where the sword was.

<blank>

Ma ......."

<blank>

There may still be hexenbiests around.

I tried to warn him so, but I couldn't speak.

Paralysis has come around quite a bit.

<blank>

A girl picks up a longsword and walks toward us.

Behind her, a mass of dark gray came rushing out of the shadowy forest toward the girl.

Gray Wolf.

<blank>

Oh, ......!"

<blank>

Immediately, Howard tried to scream, but his voice was muffled.

<blank>

<blank>

What the heck! I can't believe that my inexperience has caused me to involve even this total stranger's daughter, if only by myself!

<blank>

<blank>

What a blunder at the end of a life dedicated to the sword as a Protector.

He bites his lip in exasperation at himself.

At the very moment when it seemed that the fangs were about to reach the girl.

<blank>

Fluttering, the girl danced.

<blank>

Gray Wolf becomes two.

It is separated diagonally from the base of the front legs to the back, and falls forward through the girl's side with the momentum of the leap.

<blank>

<blank>

A shiver ran down the spine of my motionless body.

<blank>

What a beautiful sword.

The sword danced spontaneously, without any pretension or effort.

The sword blade enters the body as if it were being sucked in, and then slips out without any resistance.

Was my sword this sharp? No. It is obvious that it is the strength of the wielder.

It is a clear, unclouded movement.

How rough your sword is in comparison.

I will never forget the beautiful light of that flowing tip.

<blank>

<blank>

The hem of her skirt fluttered down as she shook her red hair and followed the fluffy girl's movements.

<blank>

"Last... this... is... fine."

<blank>

The girl mutters as she looks down at what used to be Gray Wolf with cool eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

The girl looks at Howard and huffs.

<blank>

I'm sorry... poison... afraid... to... find... out.

<blank>

He rushed over to Howard as if in a panic.

<blank>

<blank>

He kneeled on Howard's left side as he lay down and placed his right palm over the wound in his shin.

<blank>

I'll fix it... I'll fix it... now... wait.

<blank>

<blank>

(Did you just say you're going to fix me? What the hell is she doing? No way! You think you can use the art of detoxification at such a young age?)

<blank>

<blank>

Whatever the girl does, her motionless body can only watch over her.

I can't hear him clearly, but I know he is muttering something.

<blank>

Light gathers between the legs and palms.

Howard's eyes widened again in surprise.

<blank>

<blank>

(Oh! A healing glow? I didn't know it was really possible for a girl this young to use a light this warm?)

<blank>

<blank>

Warmth spreads to the left leg, which should have lost sensation.

The warmth of the warmth circulates through the entire body.

The soft warmth sinks into the area of my left arm that was gouged out by the Wolf, as well as the lips I just bit off.

I feel my whole body relaxing and my body becoming more at ease.

<blank>

Suddenly, the light disappeared and a sense of reality returned to my body.

<blank>

I... fixed... it... successfully.

The girl breathed a sigh of relief and turned a happy smile to Howard.

<blank>

"Oh, it moves, no scratches. Awesome."

<blank>

Howard raised himself up and confirmed that the paralysis was gone from his body and that he could move.

He touches his arms and legs and marvels at the fact that the scars are gone.

<blank>

Many children this age can use healing techniques to speed the healing of wounds and alleviate pain.

<blank>

However, only a well-trained priest could handle the healing techniques that completely heal wounds, detoxify them, and even allow them to move at a moment's notice.

Once again, I looked at the girl in amazement.

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you, you've been a big help."

<blank>

The girl is smiling happily.

<blank>

'And who are you, then? I don't think you are a simple man, with your swordsmanship and healing. Where in the world did you come from? No, you are not from this country, are you?

<blank>

The girl seems to have frozen in her smile.

<blank>

I'm sorry. I haven't even introduced myself yet, and you've been asking me a lot of questions in rapid succession. I'm Howard Cloud, and as you can see, I'm a rotting old geezer. I would like to thank you once again. Thank you, you saved my life."

<blank>

Howard stands up and thanks him while correcting his residency.

<blank>

I am Suzy... my name is Suzy... thank goodness... safe... peace of mind..."

<blank>

The girl also smiled again at Howard and handed him the longsword in her hand.

Howard thinks as he receives the longsword.

<blank>

<blank>

(Is the faltering language because he is from outside the country? Smuggling? In these light clothes? The way they are dressed now, it looks as if they spent a few days in the forest. Kidnapped outside the country and fled to this forest? But who could dredge up someone as skilled as this girl? No, if she was drugged... in any case, she would need to contact her family. This is not a place for her to be alone.)

<blank>

<blank>

One can only imagine the grief of the parents who suddenly lost their daughter.

And even more so when I look at this girl's hair.

<blank>

I asked my daughter about her country and she mentioned a name I had never heard before.

<blank>

This is a country called Aurora, do you understand?"

"A-rola? I don't know.

<blank>

I knew you were from out of the country....

<blank>

Do you know where you come from?"

<blank>

The girl then pointed fearfully toward the far end of the forest.

Was he really kidnapped? Nope! He could have been lost while traveling with his family.

<blank>

"Where's your family? Aren't your parents with you?"

<blank>

Unintentionally, I grabbed the girl by the shoulders.

<blank>

"Good news? No... no... since... since the first time.

<blank>

(What a thing to say...) "Did this girl really spend time alone in this forest? (What a surprise...) Did this girl really spend all her time alone in this forest?

<blank>

His brow wrinkles involuntarily and his expression becomes stern.

<blank>

<blank>

Then I heard a lovely sound coming from somewhere, Ku～～～～.

I look and the girl is bright red and holding her stomach.

Howard let go and looked down at the girl in surprise.

<blank>

Uh... um... sorry... sorry... um...

<blank>

The girl looks down and utters a flustered apology, reddening.

Howard felt the tension that had been there before slowly fade away.

As if poisoned, his facial expression collapses as he looks at the girl.

<blank>

<blank>

(It's already around noon. ......, Sonia should have lunch ready and waiting for you. I don't care about the details anymore. Now I want to entertain my benefactor, my daughter.)

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to go back to the house now for lunch, and I was wondering if you would like to join me. My wife is supposed to have prepared a large meal for the guests she was planning to bring home. It's too much for us to finish on our own. It would be very much appreciated if you could join us for dinner."

<blank>

Howard extended his hand wide and told the girl to welcome him.

<blank>

"Sho ... shokuji ... cuisine? ... food ... plenty ... of food?"

<blank>

The girl wiggled her eyes wide open with a wince, looked at Howard with a bright red face, and asked him back.

<blank>

'Yes! It's a tapas dish! Especially the herb-roasted chicken! I love that salty bird."

<blank>

Howard said happily as he recalled the bird that Sonia was prepping for cooking on the way out.

<blank>

Shio! Habu! Bird!

<blank>

His eyes widen even more and become intensely moist, as if they are about to burst into tears.

His mouth is also not closing, and it looks as if drool is about to spill out.

That's not nice for a pretty girl.

<blank>

"How about it? Would you accept my invitation?"

<blank>

"Are you sure you don't want any trouble? ... bother... you...?"

<blank>



<blank>

Howard is just broken up about it.

<blank>

Of course not! I'm not bothering or disturbing you. I just want to have lunch with you!"

<blank>

When he laughed and held out his right hand, the girl looked at it once, then looked at Howard's face, nodded repeatedly in delight, and then grabbed onto it with both hands in a hissing motion.

<blank>

I can't bring Will back, but today's guest is special.

Come on, let's go home soon.

I can see Sonia's surprised face.

I am sure they would be delighted.

<blank>

Howard took the girl and happily hurried home through the woods.
