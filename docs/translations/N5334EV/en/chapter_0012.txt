# Episode 12: Howard Cloud is Greatly Surprised

A new chapter begins. And finally, we are in the human settlement.＾＾；

----------------

<b>

Howard Cloud was feeling melancholic.

<b>

<b>

Currently, Howard was driving a one-horse carriage pulled by a black horse, making his way home.

<b>

Wearing a black sun hat and jacket with a white shirt, his gray hair and mustache peeking out from under the hat, he sat straight and composed while handling the carriage.

His appearance alone suggested that he was an honest man.

<b>

Behind his thick eyebrows, strong gray eyes were gazing.

However, there was nothing intimidating about it.

Rather, it exuded a friendly warmth.

At that moment, he slightly twisted his mouth, which was hidden by his beard, into a thoughtful expression.

<b>

Under normal circumstances, his nephew Will would have been riding in this carriage, and they would have been on their way back to their home in Amukam together.

However, what awaited Howard at the stagecoach stop was a letter handed to him by the driver.

<b>

It was from his nephew, apologizing for not being able to keep their promise due to an unexpected exam that left him no time.

The letter was filled with polite apologies for not being able to keep the promise and words of concern for his uncle and aunt.

<b>

<b>

Will, the son of Howard's brother Philip, was a lively 17-year-old young man in his second year at a high school in Dekkenbel, one of the twelve cities.

<b>

Every summer, he would come to Amukam for about a week and spend time with the Cloud family.

<b>

For the childless Cloud couple, Will's visits were an eagerly awaited event each year.

Since he entered the boarding high school, it had been arranged that he would come directly here at the start of the long summer vacation.

<b>

How to comfort his wife Sonia? She had been looking forward to it so much.

For over a week, she and the maid Elrose had been happily preparing, discussing this and that.

He could easily picture the disappointment on their faces.

<b>

As he sighed thoughtfully, Howard urged the carriage onward toward home.

<b>

<b>

At this time of year, an unexpected exam could be roughly guessed.

It was most likely related to the disturbances in the Deipara Mountains.

<b>

The sacred Deipara, said to be inhabited by gods.

The disturbances there occurred two days ago.

<b>

Some said the mountains shone.

Many witnesses claimed to have seen flashes of light.

Afterward, the clouds dissipated, and the atmosphere trembled.

The vibrations in the air were something anyone from this village would have experienced.

<b>

And the mountains changed shape. Even the peak of Mother Dear was significantly altered.

<b>

Some people were clamoring that this was the wrath of the gods or the revival of an evil deity.

<b>

In any case, the impact it had on various regions was immeasurable.

A survey team would likely be organized.

The staffing of personnel was urgent.

<b>

Moreover, with the disturbances in the gods' mountains, there would likely be those who would sow discord among the people, and the activation of magical beasts in various places was also possible.

Strengthening security against these threats was necessary.

Inevitably, there would be a shortage of manpower.

<b>

Will was an excellent candidate for knighthood.

As a supplementary force for the allocated personnel, a practical training exam would likely be conducted.

<b>

<b>

As Howard passed through a side road of the Amukam Forest, he was contemplating such matters.

<b>

<b>

The Amukam Forest.

This is the edge of the country that spreads to the north of the village of Amukam.

<b>

Though the forest bears the name of this village, it is actually part of the southern end of the Iroshio Great Forest.

<b>

If there were disturbances in the Deipara Mountains, it would not be surprising if there were some effects on the Iroshio Great Forest that spreads at its foot.

For the people living in this village, vigilance against the Amukam Forest is a part of their lives and one of the most important matters.

<b>

Moreover, there is no one in this country who knows this forest better than the villagers.

<b>

<b>

(If a full-fledged survey team heads to the Iroshio Great Forest, personnel will have to be allocated from this village as well. It is impossible to reach Deipara by passing through Iroshio. Still, we must advance as far as we can.)

<b>

<b>

As Howard drove the carriage, he was deep in thought.

<b>

Now, Howard was moving westward along the side road with the Amukam Forest to his right.

A thick log fence surrounded the edge of the forest.

The road was built along that fence.

It was a path that would not normally need to be taken, but he wanted to check the current state of the forest.

<b>

To be honest, thinking about how to tell his wife about Will made him choose a longer route.

<b>

Suddenly, he felt something unusual in the right side of the forest.

<b>

The Amukam Forest is managed by the villagers who act as its guardians.

Within 200 to 300 meters from the edge of the forest, magical beasts do not usually appear.

<b>

Villagers are always on guard, and if they spot a magical beast, they promptly deal with it.

Weak magical beasts that make their homes on the outskirts of the forest can be handled without issue even by village children.

<b>

Occasionally, more powerful magical beasts rise from deeper within, but in those cases, the village's civil protection group takes action.

<b>

In terms of pure combat power, the civil protection group's strength is not inferior to that of the knight order in the royal capital.

<b>

In fact, those of higher rank can even surpass the knight order.

<b>

Now, an unusual presence was wafting from within that forest.

Since the disturbances in Deipara, the village had raised the alert level for the forest.

<b>

Even now, many villagers were patrolling inside and outside the forest, keeping a watchful eye, and if there were any abnormalities, an alarm would immediately sound in the village.

<b>

<b>

(There may be something that has slipped through the security net.)

<b>

<b>

Howard, on guard, stopped the carriage.

He was just before a T-junction where the fence ended and the road extended into the forest.

He placed his sun hat on the seat, drew his beloved sword, and got off the carriage.

<b>

He instructed the horse to stay put and stopped the carriage's wheels.

This horse, named Regulus, had been with him for over 20 years.

<b>

In human years, it must be quite old.

As he stroked the fine scars on its front legs, he thought.

<b>

Having been together for so long, this exceptionally intelligent horse seemed to understand Howard's words, meeting his gaze and starting to nibble on the grass at its feet.

<b>

<b>

(If I leave the carriage here, someone on patrol will soon find it and realize that I have entered the forest from here. It would be quick if August found it.)

<b>

<b>

Thinking such things, Howard, with his sword at his waist, entered the forest.

<b>

This path leads about 100 meters into the forest and opens into a small clearing.

It was a place cleared by the villagers in a circular shape with a radius of about 10 meters.

<b>

This serves as a relay point for vigilance in the forest and, depending on the situation, battles with magical beasts may also take place here.

Such places are scattered throughout the forest.

From here, paths extend east and west, leading to similar clearings further ahead.

They are spread throughout the forest like an ant nest, every 500 meters to 1 kilometer apart.

<b>

Howard stepped into that clearing.

<b>

<b>

(There are indeed some... Thankfully, nothing attacked me on the way here... Are they watching me? Hmm... Three? No, there are four? This is bad; the presence is unusual. It's clearly different from that of weaklings...!)

<b>

<b>

It was nearing noon, and the sun was high, shining brightly.

However, the Amukam Forest is deep.

Even at this time, there are many places where sunlight does not reach.

Yet, this clearing received ample sunlight.

<b>

That is why the shadows of the trees made it even harder to see the figures lurking deeper within.

<b>

He could sense movement; he heard the sound of something heavy dragging.

Two pairs of red eyes glowed.

Another pair nearby.

Further away, another pair, and yet another pair close by.

<b>

<b>

(Hmm. Four creatures... No? That's not right!)

<b>

<b>

One of them slowly revealed itself in the clearing.

It was a giant snake with red eyes.

Its neck was about 50 centimeters in diameter. It looked like it could swallow an adult whole.

There was another head branching off from its thick neck.

This magical beast was called the "Two-Headed Boa."

<b>

The body supporting the two heads was thick and flat.

It was about 2 meters long, with a slender tail extending about 1 meter.

At the tip of that tail, a poisonous yellow thorn protruded, clearly identifiable as a venomous spike.

<b>

<b>

(I was careless! This is bad. The "Two-Headed Boa" is a magical beast found in deeper layers. It's too much for younglings who only deal with shallow layers. Even I am in a precarious situation with my current equipment. But if the children were to encounter this, it would be disastrous!)

<b>

<b>

He placed his hand on the sword at his waist.

It was a long sword he had used for many years.

He had enough confidence to face opponents from the middle layers.

<b>

However, the "Two-Headed Boa" was troublesome.

With two heads bearing venomous fangs, they would coordinate and attack separately.

If one were to be bitten by its poison, a human would not last half a moment before succumbing to death.

<b>

And then there were the poisonous spikes on its tail; while focusing on the heads, it could attack from another direction.

That poison would not lead to immediate death, but it would cause paralysis and rob the body of its freedom.

It was not to be underestimated.

<b>

<b>

In reality, fighting the "Two-Headed Boa" was like a 3-on-1 battle.

It was not an easy opponent that could be defeated without taking any damage.

Protective gear that could withstand its venomous fangs was necessary.

<b>

With two of them, it was like a 6-on-1 fight.

Under normal circumstances, the correct action would be to flee immediately.

Engaging in a frontal battle was madness.

<b>

But Howard discarded his jacket and drew his long sword.

<b>

<b>

(After all, it doesn't seem like they will let me escape...)

<b>

<b>

Another boa appeared from a slightly distant spot and entered the clearing.

It spread its two heads wide, blocking Howard's path, and approached him from both sides.

<b>

Then, he had no choice but to fight.

<b>

He shouldered his long sword and lowered his stance.

<b>

He had to move before they could surround him!

<b>

He kicked the ground and lunged toward the right boa, entering the range of the first one.

<b>

He swung the long sword down vigorously in front of the right head and then slashed upward to the left.

The blade sharply cut through the throat of the left head.

<b>

It did not sever it completely, but the weight of the head caused it to lean back, nearly tearing off.

Without losing momentum, he spun his body and circled around to the back of the boa, beside the nearly severed head.

<b>

Without losing his speed, he raised the long sword and struck down at the base of the poisonous tail.

The pain and anger from having its tail severed caused the remaining head to turn toward its back.

<b>

But Howard did not hesitate and swung the long sword horizontally from the left side.

This time, the boa's head was cleanly severed.

<b>

He executed the entire series of movements fluidly, all in the span of a brief moment.

<b>

The other boa, having followed Howard's movement, tried to attack him from behind, but it quickly lost its target as Howard hid behind the first one.

<b>

Now, it was showing its vigilance and anger, baring its fangs and making threatening sounds while gauging the distance to Howard.

<b>

<b>

(Well then, this makes it even!)

<b>

<b>

He turned the dire situation around.

It was truly exhilarating.

He couldn't help but grin.

He twirled the tip of his long sword, measuring the distance as he circled around the boa.

<b>

Then, something moved at the edge of his vision.

He saw something leap out from the shadows of the left trees.

It was a "Gray Wolf."

A large dark gray wolf-like magical beast with a long mane on its back.

It should also be found in the middle layers.

<b>

<b>

(I messed up! I misjudged the presence! There were indeed three creatures!)

<b>

<b>

The Gray Wolf lunged straight for Howard's neck.

Its body exceeded 2 meters in length.

<b>

Just being tackled would be fatal.

Howard instinctively dropped his body to evade, but its claws gouged into his left upper arm through his shirt.

The Gray Wolf's claws were hard and vicious.

<b>

As he fell, he swung his long sword beneath the wolf's body.

The blade sliced through the wolf's belly horizontally, spilling its entrails.

Just before his back hit the ground, he felt something approaching his feet.

<b>

He tried to dodge, but it was too late; he felt the flesh above his left ankle being gouged.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

As his body hit the ground, he rolled away from the boa to create distance and quickly got back on his feet.

<b>

The boa's poisonous spike was attacking Howard's left leg.

<b>

<b>

(What do you mean even? You fool! You got carried away!)

<b>

<b>

He scolded himself for neglecting to be vigilant.

He had already lost feeling in his left leg below the knee.

<b>

<b>

(Dodging... is difficult. My power isn't enough, and I can't evade completely. Then, I'll just have to deal a fatal blow right here. I can't let this thing escape unscathed!)

<b>

<b>

Howard crouched down, positioning the tip of his long sword on the ground to the left, gathering his strength.

He could hardly feel his left arm; he focused all his senses to swing the long sword.

<b>

As the prey stopped moving, the boa lunged at Howard.

Opening its double mouths, it rushed toward him to stab its venomous fangs.

<b>

Howard's muscles creaked as he sank deeper, timing the moment to unleash his attack.

<b>

However, he was dragged down by his left leg, slightly losing his balance.

<b>

The boa leaped at him, but Howard's initial movement was delayed.

<b>

Just before the boa's fangs reached Howard, a spear suddenly pierced the ground between them.

The boa flinched at the object that pierced its nose, momentarily stunned.

<b>

<b>

(A spear? No, a branch?! This is a tree branch!)

<b>

<b>

Seizing the opportunity of its momentary hesitation, Howard released his strength.

He aimed for the area beneath the neck where its heart was located.

The long sword was swung powerfully and horizontally.

<b>

Along with the piercing branch, he cleaved the boa's body in two.

<b>

The severed body writhed in agony, thrashing about, but without its heart, it soon ceased to move.

<b>

Howard exhausted his strength and collapsed to the ground.

His beloved sword slipped from his hand and fell beside him.

<b>

<b>

(This is bad; I need to comfort Sonia. I shouldn't be lying here like this... I can't feel my lower body anymore...)

<b>

<b>

Lying on his back, basking in the sunlight, he gazed at the blue sky and thought such things... when suddenly, he felt something move above his head.

He briefly felt alarmed, thinking it might still be there, but it seemed to be a person.

The figure knelt beside Howard, leaning in close and speaking to him.

<b>

"Are you... okay?"

<b>

When Howard saw the figure in his line of sight, his breath momentarily stopped.

In that instant, he felt as if he saw someone overlapping with the shadow looking down at him.

<b>

(...! No way! Ravi?! Could it be?!!)

<b>

But he quickly dismissed such thoughts.

<b>

The fleeting illusion vanished, revealing a girl before him.

A girl with brilliantly shining red hair, peering down with cobalt green eyes that sparkled like crystals, asking with concern.

<b>

Her voice was transparent, gentle, and lovely.

The girl's attire was unlike anything seen around here.

It looked as if she had wandered through the forest, with various rips and dirt all over.

Her arms and legs were similarly dirty, and her face was quite soiled.

<b>

<b>

(What a beautiful girl, but it's a shame she's in such a state... Is she a lost traveler?)

<b>

<b>

Then the girl reached her hand behind Howard's head.

<b>

"I'm going to... take you to the shade... now."

<b>

Saying this, she pulled him closer.

<b>

Realizing that she was trying to lift him, Howard panicked.

<b>

"Wait, you can't do this alone..."

<b>

Howard was 195 cm tall.

At 62 years old, he had never neglected his daily training, and his body was still covered in well-defined muscles.

There was no way a petite girl could lift him.

<b>

However, disregarding Howard's concerns, the girl lifted him without hesitation.

Howard's eyes widened in surprise, speechless.

Noticing Howard's gaze, the girl tilted her head slightly, looking back at him with a puzzled expression.

<b>

She effortlessly carried Howard, gently laying him down in the shade.

<b>

"I'll... bring the sword... now."

<b>

Saying this, she left to retrieve the sword.

<b>

"Wait..."

<b>

There might still be magical beasts around.

He tried to warn her, but no sound came out.

The paralysis had spread significantly.

The girl picked up the long sword and walked toward him.

From the shadows of the dense forest behind her, a dark gray mass leaped toward her.

It was the Gray Wolf.

<b>

"Oh...!"

<b>

Howard instinctively tried to shout, but no voice came out.

<b>

<b>

What a disaster! Due to his own incompetence, not only was he in danger, but now this unknown girl was involved too!!

<b>

<b>

What a disgrace for the life he had dedicated to serving as a civil protector.

He bit his lip in frustration at himself.

Just as the wolf's fangs seemed about to reach the girl.

<b>

The girl suddenly leaped gracefully.

<b>

The Gray Wolf was cleaved in two.

It was sliced diagonally from the base of its front legs to its back, and it fell forward, propelled by its own momentum, landing in front of the girl.

<b>

<b>

A shiver ran down Howard's spine as he lay motionless.

<b>

What a beautiful sword technique.

There was no strain or tension; the sword danced naturally.

The blade slid in as if drawn in, passing through without any resistance.

Was his sword truly this sharp? No, it was clearly the skill of the wielder.

It was a movement so clear and unclouded.

In comparison, his own swordsmanship felt so rough.

The glimmer of that flowing blade, that beautiful light, was something he would never forget.

<b>

<b>

The girl's red hair swayed, and her skirt fluttered down as if following her movements.

<b>

"This is... okay... now."

<b>

With a calm gaze, the girl looked down at what was once the Gray Wolf and murmured.

<b>

Then the girl suddenly noticed Howard and gasped.

<b>

"I'm sorry... the poison... took longer... to notice."

<b>

She hurriedly rushed over to Howard.

<b>

<b>

Kneeling beside Howard's left side, she placed her right palm over the wound on his shin.

<b>

"I'm going to... heal... it... right away... wait."

<b>

(Did she just say she's going to heal me? What is this girl planning to do? Could it be! Can she use detoxification techniques at such a young age?)

<b>

Whatever the girl intended to do, Howard could only watch in his immobile state.

He could faintly hear her mumbling something.

<b>

Light gathered between her hands and feet.

Howard's eyes widened in astonishment once more.

<b>

(Oh! Healing light?! She can truly use it... and with such warmth, this young girl?)

<b>

He felt warmth spreading through his left leg, which had lost sensation.

Slowly, he could feel that warmth circulating throughout his body.

The soft warmth seeped into the area where the wolf had bitten his left arm and even into the lip he had bitten earlier.

He felt all the tension leave his body, and he relaxed.

<b>

Suddenly, the light vanished, and reality returned to his senses.

<b>

"I was able to... heal it... successfully."

The girl sighed in relief, looking at Howard with a joyful smile.

<b>

"Oh, I can move, and the wounds... are gone. Amazing."

<b>

Howard sat up, confirming that the paralysis had lifted and he could move.

He touched his arms and legs, astonished to find that the wounds had disappeared.

While many children could use healing techniques to alleviate pain and speed up healing, few could completely heal wounds and detoxify, allowing someone to move immediately afterward without proper training as a priest.

He looked at the girl with renewed astonishment.

<b>

"Thank you; I owe my life to you."

<b>

The girl smiled happily.

<b>

"By the way, who are you? Your swordsmanship and healing abilities are far from ordinary. Where do you come from? No, you are not from this country, are you?"

<b>

The girl seemed to freeze, still smiling.

<b>

"Oh, I apologize. I shouldn't have bombarded you with questions without introducing myself first... I am Howard Cloud, a decrepit old man as you can see. I want to thank you again. Thanks to you, I have been saved."

<b>

Howard stood up, straightening himself as he expressed his gratitude.

<b>

"My name... is Suzy... I'm glad... you're safe... I was worried..."

<b>

The girl smiled at Howard again, handing him the long sword she had been holding.

As Howard accepted the long sword, he pondered.

<b>

(The way she speaks hesitantly indicates she is indeed from another country? An illegal immigrant? In this light attire? From her current appearance, it looks like she has spent several days in the forest. Did she get kidnapped abroad and escape into this forest? But is there anyone capable of abducting a girl as skilled as her? No, if drugs were used... In any case, I need to contact her family. This is no place for a girl to be alone.)

<b>

The sorrow of parents suddenly losing their daughter was not hard to imagine.

Especially when he looked at the girl's hair, it tightened his chest even more.

He asked the girl about her country, but she mentioned a name he had never heard before.

<b>

"This country is called Aurora; do you know it?"

"Aurora? ...I don't... know."

<b>

So she is indeed from another country...

<b>

"Do you know where you came from?"

<b>

When he asked, the girl hesitantly pointed toward the depths of the forest.

Had she truly been kidnapped? No! There was also the possibility that she got lost while traveling with her family.

<b>

"What about your family? Aren't your parents with you?"

<b>

He instinctively grabbed the girl's shoulder.

<b>

"Parents? ...I don't have... from the beginning..."

<b>

(What does this mean? This girl has truly been alone in this forest...)

<b>

He couldn't help but furrow his brow, his expression turning serious.

<b>

Then, from somewhere, he heard a cute sound, "Kuuuu~."

Looking, he saw the girl blushing and holding her stomach.

Howard, surprised, released his grip and looked down at her.

<b>

"Oh... I'm sorry... um... excuse me..."

<b>

The girl looked down, blushing, and hurriedly apologized.

Howard felt the tension that had been present dissipating slowly.

As if the poison had been drawn out, he found himself smiling at the girl.

<b>

(It's already past noon... Sonia must be preparing lunch and waiting for me. The details no longer matter. Right now, I want to treat this girl, my benefactor.)

<b>

"I was planning to return to the mansion for lunch; would you like to join me? My wife is likely preparing plenty of food for the guest she was expecting. It's more than we can handle alone. It would be a great help if you could share a meal with us."

<b>

Howard spread his arms wide, conveying his welcome to the girl.

<b>

"Meal... food? ...lunch... plenty?"

<b>

The girl looked wide-eyed, trembling slightly, her face turning bright red as she asked back.

<b>

"Yes! Plenty of food! Especially herb-roasted chicken! I love that salty chicken."

<b>

Howard recalled the chicken Sonia had been preparing just before he left, speaking happily.

<b>

"Salt!! Herb!! ...Chicken!"

<b>

Her eyes widened even more, and they began to glisten; she looked like she was about to cry.

Her mouth was agape, and it seemed like drool was about to spill from her.

What a cute girl; this was unacceptable.

<b>

"How about it? Will you accept my invitation?"

<b>

"Would it... be a bother? ...Would it be... an intrusion?"

<b>

The girl moved her hands nervously in front of her chest, her face turning bright red, looking as if she might burst into tears at any moment.

<b>

Howard couldn't help but break into a smile.

<b>

"Of course not! It's not a bother or an intrusion. I want to have lunch with you!"

<b>

Laughing, he extended his right hand, and after looking at his hand, the girl looked at Howard's face, nodded happily several times, and then tightly grasped his right hand with both of hers.

<b>

He couldn't bring Will back, but today's guest was special.

Now, let's hurry home.

He could already picture Sonia's surprised face.

She would surely be delighted.

<b>

Howard took the girl by the hand and hurriedly made his way through the forest, joyfully heading home.
