# Episode 76: The Crimson Annihilator

Thank you for your patience!

<b>

It's Suzi's unstoppable rampage!!

----------------

<b>

At first, I thought that since I had heard it was a group of undead, they would only consist of skeletons and zombies.

The footage I was shown also depicted those kinds, so I had assumed they were being led by an Elder Lich or something similar.

<b>

However, when they entered my exploration range, I realized it was not the case when I captured multiple vampires.

<b>

<b>

The first one I found was a white vampire.

Moreover, three people I knew, including one I recognized, were surrounded by them and in a near-death state.

<b>

The white vampire I spotted... there were a total of eight Lesser Vampires.

All of them were dressed in white maid-like outfits, on all fours with their limbs, extending long, red tongues from their mouths that were split up to their ears, giggling as they licked the blood of the fallen.

They maintain their victims in a state just shy of death, sipping their life’s blood!

What a truly horrifying bunch!!

<b>

When the Lesser Vampires noticed me, they bared their fangs and made beast-like hissing sounds as they attempted to leap at me, but I wasn't so idle as to wait for their attacks!

<b>

I gathered 'ki' in my left hand, which was hanging limply.

I imagined droplets of water gathering at my fingertips as I lowered my wet hand.

With that, I lightly swung my left hand toward them.

As if droplets were splashing from my fingertips, countless fine 'ki' pierced through the air at high speed toward the Lesser Vampires.

The vampires burst into white particles like soap bubbles, dissolving into the atmosphere.

<b>

With the filth cleaned up, only the three injured knights remained among the trees.

Perhaps because they were all bleeding profusely, their skin lacked color. But they were still alive!

<b>

And yes! There was Jimon!

Jimon, who had spent time in the village with Magritte and Lysa!!

That Jimon was severely injured. His shoulder was torn open, and the bleeding was severe. His lungs seemed to be damaged as well.

<b>

《Chain Regeneration》

This healing skill connects the target with a line of life force, restoring the HP of all beings on that line and continuously recovering life force for a short time.

<b>

While dashing with Regulus, I quickly cast this healing magic on Jimon.

Since this magic does not recover MP, he probably wouldn't be able to move yet, but everyone’s wounds are completely healed, so I’ll be moving on ahead, okay?

<b>

For now, it’s certain that my priority for annihilating vampires has risen even further at this moment.

<b>

<b>

As I passed Jimon and the others, undead began to appear one after another.

They were all just bones! Some even had the audacity to wear armor.

I crushed them one by one as they caught my eye!

With Regulus' hooves, I pierced and shattered my way forward.

The ones that were farther away were blown away and crushed by the pressure of my fist, which carried a small amount of 'ki'.

<b>

Then, I quickly encountered a gathering of bones.

<b>

They were swarming around a wall arranged in a circular shape, as if the ceiling of a dome had been cut off.

Wow, it looked like a swarm of insects, and it felt disgusting!!

The wall was crumbling in places, but it was about three to five meters high, I guess?

<b>

The overlapping undead sometimes spilled over into the inside of the wall, but it seemed they were being intercepted inside.

There were quite a few zombies with flesh on them, so it felt like a zombie movie, and it was terrifying!

Ugh! A pig! There’s even a pig zombie!!

The fear factor just increased by 50%!!!

<b>

I’ll clear them out quickly because they’re gross!

<b>

As I drew my silver sword with my right hand, I infused it with 'ki'.

I then slightly turned Regulus' direction to the left, positioning the right side toward the wall, and swung the sword in one go, unleashing a shockwave infused with 'ki'.

<b>

With a powerful gust, the undead were blown away and scattered into particles.

<b>

Alright! With that, I’ve cleared out the undead within my visible range! I think I took care of nearly a hundred? There are still many on the other side of the wall, but for now, I’ve removed the obstacles in my path!

<b>

I urged Regulus to charge straight ahead, leaping over the wall.

Regulus gained momentum and leaped into the air as if flying.

As a bonus, I blew away the undead visible from above with the shockwave from my left sword.

It seemed the knights guarding the northern gate were about to be overwhelmed, so I swept through there.

There were a few big ones, but they scattered along with the others, so I think we’re safe for a while.

<b>

While flying through the air, I spotted him! Papa Howard!

He was almost in the center of this wall!!

<b>

“Papa Howard!!”

<b>

As Regulus was still in the air, I leaped off his back and dove straight toward Papa Howard, clinging to his body.

<b>

“Papa! Papa! Papa Howard!!”

<b>

I knelt beside Papa Howard, placing my hand on his chest, calling his name.

He had terrible wounds all over his body, and his face was completely drained of color!

His face was in such a terrible state, as if it had been dragged by something.

How could this happen?!!!

Tears blurred my vision involuntarily.

But his eyelids moved slightly. He was responding to my voice!

<b>

“I’ll help you right away…!”

<b>

I couldn't help but speak with a tearful voice, but right after calling out, I used my healing magic.

<b>

《Vitality Release》

This skill instantly restores the HP and MP of allies around me, a divine healing skill of the Great Wise Man.

Nearby, Gilberto and Conrad were also lying down, wrapped in bandages, so I’ll heal them together!

<b>

A ripple of light spread throughout the wall, centered around me.

Of course, Papa Howard, Gilberto, and Conrad, and everyone inside the wall were enveloped in a pillar of light.

This will be fine! The wounds on their faces were disappearing before my eyes, and their color was returning.

And then, Papa Howard’s eyelids slowly lifted.

<b>

“Papa! Papa Howard! I’m so glad…”

“...Su...zi? ...Is that you, Suzi...?”

<b>

After finally opening his heavy eyelids, Papa Howard squinted and looked at me, as if he couldn't believe it.

<b>

<b>

“...Is this... not a dream... or an illusion?”

“It’s me! It’s Suzi! I’m real!!”

<b>

Papa Howard weakly lifted his hand to touch my cheek, murmuring such things.

I held his hand, assuring him that I was real.

Ah, that once strong hand is now so weak!

My eyes began to well up with tears again.

<b>

...But something is strange. Something feels off.

“Vitality Release” not only restores physical strength but also magical power.

Even if mana is depleted, it should recover as well.

So why is Papa Howard still so weak?

<b>

I checked Papa Howard's physical condition again.

It was indeed strange. His maximum health was fluctuating slightly.

<b>

“Vitality Release” continues to have a restorative effect for a short time even after it is used.

If the maximum health is fluctuating, it means the skill is continuously restoring the lost health.

The wounds are closed, yet health is decreasing?

Moreover, his magical power is also continuing to decrease!

Why?!

<b>

“...I never thought I would meet Suzi here...”

“I’m here! I’m right here!”

“...To be watched over by my daughter in the land where my friend sleeps... How fulfilled... my life must be... at this end...”

“No! ...I don’t want to hear you say it’s the end!”

<b>

After saying that, Papa Howard closed his eyes and lost consciousness.

<b>

“Papa? Papa Howard! ...I’ll save you! I will definitely save you!”

<b>

I held Papa Howard's hand, raising my voice without thinking.

Before I knew it, the effect of the continuous healing had worn off.

I could see Papa Howard's health rapidly declining. Conrad and Gilberto too!

<b>

I quickly used healing magic.

《Field Greater Heal》

A healing magic that restores health in an area centered on the selected target.

This also has a continuous healing effect.

<b>

The healing light spread, enveloping Conrad and Gilberto as well.

<b>

Their depleted health was fully restored, but the maximum health was still fluctuating.

Is this some kind of poison or status ailment?!

<b>

I decided to try casting “Greater Purify.”

This high-level purification magic can remove not only poison but also paralysis, petrification, and all physical status ailments.

A pure light enveloped Papa Howard and began to rise.

<b>

But it was no use! The fluctuation in maximum health didn’t stop!

What?! What is causing this?!

<b>

“Hm, I believe this is some kind of curse.”

<b>

Suddenly, a voice called out from behind me.

When I turned around, there was a long-haired, beautiful elf with long ears.

I think she was a professor of magical dynamics accompanying the research team.

The half-elf woman behind her was nodding vigorously.

<b>

A curse? If that’s the case, I used “Bright of Purge.”

This is also a skill of the Great Wise Man that can remove curses and all debuffs, the highest level of magic.

Several rings of light appeared around Papa Howard, rotating and converging, finally shattering with a sound like breaking glass.

<b>

But still nothing! Didn’t you say it was a curse?!!

Ignoring the tears that spilled from my eyes, I turned back to the professor.

<b>

“Hmm, I suspect that it’s affecting a very deep spiritual area. I don’t think you can see it unless you look deeper and reach the source.”

<b>

The professor spoke quickly.

...Deeper? Spiritual? ...Look deeper?

<b>

I focused my gaze back on Papa Howard.

Not with physical sight, but expanding my vision from within... 

Yes, not the information of the etheric body I usually read, but capturing the etheric body itself with my conscious vision. Deeper and wider...

<b>

As I captured the spiritual quality of Papa Howard, I noticed something strange.

<b>

The etheric bodies of Papa Howard and the others were thin.

How should I put it... they seemed to be unraveling?

<b>

Those unraveled ethers were extending from their bodies like threads, leading somewhere.

<b>

This was the case for all three of them.

<b>

The threads extending from them were all heading in the same direction.

Yes, north from here...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

―――――I see! That’s it!!!―――――

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Just as I found the destination of the ether threads, a part of the southern wall crumbled.

The people inside the wall seemed to be in a flurry, but I could see them, it was Aria and the others.

They had caught up.

<b>

It had been nearly 30 minutes since I started treating Papa Howard.

<b>

Aria and the others broke through the weakened part of the wall and entered.

There were no undead on the south side anymore.

<b>

Time was of the essence, so before welcoming Aria and the others, I decided to finish what I needed to do.

<b>

《Play of the Genie Drum》

Increases stamina and endurance by 50%.

Then, I used “Relaxing Concerto” to further increase the HP and MP of Papa Howard and the others, enhancing their recovery speed.

<b>

Additionally, I raised my hands toward the sky and snapped my fingers.

《Summon Yggdrasil》

A gigantic seed fell from the sky, and in an instant, a young world tree grew.

If they stay under this tree's shade, their health and magical recovery speed will increase.

<b>

《Summon Light Fairy》

The summoned fairy began to continuously heal the HP of the specified target at regular intervals.

The summoned fairy immediately started healing Papa Howard.

Alright! This should keep them safe for a while.

<b>

“Whoa?! Hey?!”

<b>

Aria was making some kind of ridiculous noise?

Well, whatever. For now, I’ll ask Anna Mary, who came nearby.

<b>

“Anna Mary... Could you please take care of Papa Howard?”

“Understood. ...What will you do, my lady?”

“I’m going to remove the source.”

<b>

When I turned my gaze north and spoke, Anna Mary smiled gently.

<b>

“Leave the matter of my husband to me. Please, unleash your power to your heart's content.”

<b>

She said that while bowing deeply.

I nodded slightly, moved away from Anna Mary, and reached for one of the weapons stacked nearby.

<b>

“I’ll borrow this, okay?”

“...Huh? Oh! Yes!”

<b>

Nearby, the maintenance chief Fred was present, so I politely informed him and took a spear.

The weapons here are spare ones gathered to be handed out to the knights fighting on the front lines.

<b>

I lightly swung the spear I had taken. It was about two meters long, I guess? Quite light.

As I spun it around my body, it sliced through the air nicely.

Its strength is about the lower end of rank D.

Well, this should be just right.

<b>

I held the spear and turned to the north, nodding to Anna Mary as if to say I was counting on her, then whispered to Papa Howard that I was going.

I had to act quickly. I took a couple of steps to build momentum and kicked off the ground, rushing outside the wall.

<b>

I might have jumped a bit too forcefully.

I felt a shockwave spread.

The wind blew my cloak open, and my hood fell off, loosening my hair.

But this wasn't the time to worry about that.

<b>

My cloak flapped in the wind with a rustling sound.

I soared over the trees around the wall, which were about 15 to 16 meters tall.

Then, from there, I spotted my target.

<b>

The distance from here was less than a kilometer. At most, about 700 to 800 meters?

There, a black wall stretched east and west, blocking the road to the north.

<b>

That’s it, that’s the “Black Rock.”

<b>

It looks like a horizontally long “Ayers Rock,” right?

Well, I’ve never seen the real Ayers Rock!

<b>

As soon as I spotted the black rock, my body, which had risen over the trees, was pulled down by gravity toward the ground.

As I looked around while descending, I saw the undead I had scattered beginning to gather again.

<b>

Among them, there were several vampires mixed in...

In addition to the white Lesser Vampires swarming, there were also several Elder Vampires.

But they wouldn’t stand a chance against Aria and the others now.

I only need to eliminate those in my path.

<b>

As soon as my feet touched the ground, I kicked off toward a vampire about 100 meters ahead.

This time, there were no people around, so I didn’t hold back when kicking off the ground.

Breaking through the sound barrier, I burst through the compressed air, creating a white cloud for an instant, and in 0.3 seconds, I closed in on it and kicked it away.

The pale-skinned vampire looked surprised for a moment, but the next moment, it burst like a soap bubble and disappeared into light particles.

<b>

I might not have needed to deal with it, but I kicked it because I felt annoyed the moment I saw it!

<b>

Before my feet touched the ground again, I infused a small amount of 'ki' into the spear I held.

Then, I carefully aimed and threw it as I landed.

<b>

I had to be careful not to hurt the person who was pinned down.

I threw it just right so that it would barely graze the target, then started running.

<b>

The spear I threw aimed at the point of impact, making a wide arc to the left.

I then drew my silver sword on the left and, weaving through the trees, ran faster than the thrown spear, scattering and obliterating the undead around me.

<b>

The trees in this area had thick trunks but were quite sparse, so I could blow away the undead without having to weave too intricately.

The spear reached the undead in its path and obliterated the target.

As the spear was about to fly past, I circled around in front of it and caught it with my right hand.

<b>

As I caught the spear, the vampire that had been blown away by it rolled and flew off a little ahead.

The spear had grazed its side, causing it to be blown away slightly off the line of fire.

The black dress it wore was torn, and the head of the Elder Vampire was blown away, causing its body to roll around in a spectacular manner.

...Does it only wear a dress?

Its dress was lifted, revealing various things, but... well, whatever!

More importantly, Kyle! Kyle, who had been pinned down by the vampire, was almost out of health!

<b>

As I hurried closer, I caught a glimpse of his body lying on the ground, so I immediately cast healing magic.

<b>

《Bright Heal》

A single-target healing magic that instantly restores health and magical power.

<b>

That was a close call, but now he’s fine.

As I breathed a sigh of relief and got closer to confirm his condition...!

<b>

“Wha-?!”

<b>

I turned my face away with all my might, realizing my face was flushed with blood!

What in the world is Kyle wearing?! Kyle!!!

Why is he so exposed like that...?!

Cough cough, cough!!

I certainly remember the familiar things that used to be there!! But now I’m a maiden!

That’s not something I should be looking at!!!

<b>

For now, I picked up a branch lying on the ground and used it to hook the edge of the cloak covering Kyle's body, trying not to directly look at it as I threw the cloak over his lower body to cover him!!

<b>

Immediately after that, the healed Kyle regained consciousness and suddenly tried to sit up, so I hurriedly used magic to put him back to sleep!!

What would I do if he woke up and the cloak I had just thrown over him fell off?!!

<b>

A strange tension that was different from before began to fade away.

<b>

<b>

Before I knew it, the vampire I had blown away was getting up and coming toward me.

I had been careful not to hurt Kyle, so it was still alive... even though I blew its head off, it had grown a new one, really persistent.

But the new face looked reptilian. Is it a snake woman?!

<b>

“It’s you! Is it your doing?! I won’t forgive you, little girl! I will make you disappear without a trace!!!”

<b>

Suddenly, it began to scream.

How annoying... Are all vampires this loud?

The snake woman raised her hands above her head and began to gather magical power in her palms directed upward.

It quickly transformed into a rapidly spinning flame.

The flames became fireballs and were shot at me in rapid succession.

<b>

I directed my left fist, infused with 'ki', toward the fireballs.

Then, I snapped my fingers as if to flick them away, sending the 'ki' forward.

The incoming fireballs extinguished in an instant like the flame of a blown-out match.

<b>

“Kelmu Eigo Espero Eude. I, Suzi Cloud, the daughter of the Cloud family, call upon the great fire guide Salamander. With that flame, grant me the power to strike down my enemies! 《Fire Bread》”

<b>

With my palm still facing the snake woman, I chanted the incantation and unleashed the magic.

The snake woman seemed surprised by the magical power converging in my palm, her eyes widening for a moment, but it was too late! The fired “Fire Bread” roared and instantly evaporated the snake woman, creating a wide path by carving through the surrounding trees and ground.

In the distance, I heard a sound as if something had been struck...

<b>

...Did I go too far?

No! As long as no one is around, it’s safe! Safe!!

Yes! If a shortcut has been made, then there’s no problem! No problem at all!

<b>

With that, I thought I would proceed down the newly created path, but leaving Kyle in this state would be too cruel!

So I decided to leave a guard behind.

<b>

《Summon Cat the Cat》

An initial magic summoning skill that calls forth a summoned beast to protect and heal the caster.

<b>

A magic circle glowed on the ground, and from it, a huge cat with a big head, about three heads tall and the height of a person, stood up on two legs.

It meowed as if to greet me.

What a cute little guy!

<b>

It wore big leather boots on its feet, a matching leather vest, and a pair of explorer goggles on its head.

And its hands were very large.

<b>

“Alright! I’m assigning Officer Nyantaro to guard Kyle!”

<b>

“Meow!” it saluted energetically in response.

Then, it dashed off toward the north.

And then, it delivered a massive paw punch to the undead that appeared from between the trees!

The undead that received the elegant jab burst apart as if it had exploded, turning into light particles along with the armor it was wearing, disappearing in an instant among the trees.

<b>

Good! No problems at all!

The difference in combat power is overwhelming. There are still undead scattered around, but with the cat here, there’s nothing to worry about.

The cat crossed its arms in front of its chest and then opened them powerfully, as if to say “Osu!” while saying “Meow!”

Oh my! How cute!

<b>

I was tempted to pet it, but this isn’t the time for that!

I must finish this as soon as possible!

Once it’s done, I’ll pet it to my heart’s content! I’ll pet it endlessly!!!

<b>

The undead in this area are no longer a problem.

There’s still one Elder Vampire a little distance away, but... yeah, Aria is heading that way. So it should be fine!

<b>

I entrusted the area to the cat and immediately started running toward my target.

<b>

My destination is the Black Rock.

I rushed toward the point where undead were overflowing from it, flying across the ground.

<b>

The undead that blocked my way were lightly blown away by my spear.

With a single swing of the spear, dozens of bones were blown away, resembling a pile of dead branches.

<b>

The target is right in front of me! I’ll finish this quickly!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was a place thick with the stench of death.

The surrounding black rocks had an unusual shape, as if made from the innards of living creatures, giving the sensation of being contained within the womb of a gigantic being, a surreal feeling.

<b>

When Magritte Goche regained her hazy consciousness, what spread before her eyes was that black, grotesque wall.

As her consciousness gradually surfaced from the realm of dreams and reality, she became aware that her body wouldn’t move, realizing that this bizarre sight was indeed reality.

<b>

“Hey! You awake now? Hahaha!”

<b>

At the sudden voice, Magritte’s consciousness rapidly awakened, but she couldn’t move her body.

She could feel her body, but it was as if she had forgotten how to use her muscles, unable to move.

She barely managed to move her neck and eyes, catching a glimpse of the source of the voice.

<b>

It was a man sitting in a black chair.

A throne set several steps higher than where Magritte lay.

The chair, constructed of black bones and shaped like the wall, seemed to be a black and grotesque throne.

<b>

The man with dark skin sat in that throne-like chair, resting one elbow on the armrest, his chin in his hand, lazily looking down at Magritte with his crimson eyes glimmering.

<b>

“...A vampire.”

<b>

Seeing the man’s eyes, Magritte murmured.

She was certain of it, sensing the chilling aura he exuded and seeing his glowing red eyes.

At the same time, Magritte began to focus on the situation she was in.

<b>

What happened after that? Where is this place? And who is this vampire?

<b>

“Having an unconscious woman is no fun, you know. Hahaha!”

<b>

The man said this as he stood up from the black chair and stepped down from the platform.

Magritte became acutely aware of her body.

<b>

At that time, she had received a deep wound to her abdomen in the battle with that black-haired vampire.

But now, while there was a dull ache in her abdomen, there was no significant pain.

As she tried to look at the wound she had supposedly received, she moved her neck as far down as it would go, only to discover that her chest armor had been stripped away, exposing her chest.

<b>

“What... what is...?!”

<b>

Words failed her in the face of such humiliation. She instinctively tried to move her arms to cover herself, but her arms wouldn’t budge.

Her cheeks flushed with anger, shame, and humiliation.

<b>

“Nice look you got there. Are you trying to entice me? Huh? Hahaha!”

<b>

The man’s laughter echoed above her head.

<b>

“...W-what are you doing? What do you intend to do...?! Ugh!!”

<b>

The man carelessly grabbed Magritte’s hair and lifted her up to his face level.

<b>

“What do I intend to do? Hahaha! I’m going to enjoy you, of course! I’ll savor you and have fun! Right? Hahahahaha!”

<b>

Lifted by one hand by the man, Magritte’s view rose, allowing her to see her surroundings again.

Right next to where Magritte lay, Lysa was also lying down.

<b>

Blood was smeared around her mouth, as if she had coughed it up, and her complexion was not good.

However, her chest was rising and falling slightly.

Magritte sensed that Lysa was still alive, feeling relieved.

What about Jimon? Where is he?! Is he nearby? Is he safe?!

<b>

Magritte hurriedly looked around to see if there were any other figures.

But what her gaze fell upon was...

<b>

“...Risa? No way... no way?!”

“Oh? I see, you recognize her! Hahaha! They wanted to enjoy themselves a bit more, but since it had been a while, I ended up devouring them all in one night! Hahaha!”

<b>

There, Magritte saw the figures of her four companions who had been taken away in chains late at night.

They were all stripped of their clothes, discarded as if they had been devoured, on the other side of the black chair.

<b>

“...This... this is...”

“However, I can still enjoy myself after this! Hah! I’ll have plenty of time to play with them later! Hahaha!”

<b>

The man looked at the discarded figures with lewd eyes, licking his tongue and laughing loudly.

<b>

“Y-you! You’ve done this to them, and now you intend to... to toy with them even more?! You can’t even respect the dead?!!”

“Oh?! What are you saying? Who do you think I am? There’s no one who loves the dead more than me! Right? Hah! Hahahahaha!”

<b>

The man lifted Magritte even higher, running his long, red, reptilian tongue along her neck.

<b>

“Are you going to entertain me? Huh? Show me some spirit and emotions, will you?”

“W-what?! Ugh...! Stop it!!”

<b>

The man watched Magritte squirm with interest, but then suddenly turned his gaze down to his feet.

<b>

“Hmph, I think I’ll take this one first... This one is still fresh! Hah! If I take it right in front of you, you’ll enjoy it a bit too, right? Hahaha!”

<b>

He looked down at Lysa, who was groaning softly, and casually tossed Magritte aside, reaching for Lysa.

Magritte hit the ground and let out a small cry of pain, but immediately turned her unresponsive body to glare at the man.

<b>

“What are you going to do to Lysa?! Stop! Stop it!! Ugh!”

“Hah! That’s right! Get angry! Hahaha!”

<b>

The man grabbed Lysa’s hair just like he had with Magritte, lifting her up and running his tongue along her neck.

<b>

“...Ugh! What...?! Ugh?! Ugh!”

“L-Lysa!”

“Hey! You awake now? Hah! Just in time, I’ll have plenty of fun with you! I got a bit carried away and exhausted myself, so I’m a little hungry! Hah! Hahahaha!”

“Stop! Lysa! Let her go! ...Damn it! Let her go! Let her go!!!”

<b>

Lysa, now conscious, noticed the man and fell into a slight panic.

The man laughed mockingly, enjoying Lysa’s screams as he continued to run his tongue along her neck.

<b>

Magritte struggled to move her body, but it wouldn’t respond to her wishes.

She could only gnash her teeth in frustration, tears welling up at her own helplessness as she couldn’t stop the brutal act unfolding before her.

<b>

Is it still impossible for me?

Can I not reach him yet?

Surely he wouldn’t allow such brutality!

No matter how dire the situation, he would never give up and would surely save the person in front of him.

I’m still not at his level...

His back feels so... far away!

<b>

<b>

“...Seriously, are all knights so noble? Can’t you struggle a bit more for your life? You’re all so boring!!”

<b>

As Magritte tried to steel herself with a bitter expression, the man spat out words that seemed to express his disappointment.

<b>

“Get angry enough to break through! Otherwise, it won’t be tasty, and more importantly, you won’t be able to come to me after I eat you! Only when your anger and hatred break through can you come to me! Huh?”

<b>

The man continued his tirade with irritation.

He placed his hand on Lysa’s neck, gradually digging his sharp claws into her throat.

The man grinned, satisfied, as he watched Lysa cry out in pain, sipping the dripping blood.

<b>

“I’ve had Joel for nearly a hundred years. I was hoping to catch a knight this time, so I had a bit of expectation, but... what a letdown!”

<b>

The man then plunged his fangs into Lysa’s white throat. At the same time, Lysa’s high-pitched scream echoed through the cave.

<b>

“Lysa—!!!”

<b>

Magritte’s scream resonated alongside Lysa’s cry.

The man raised his face from Lysa’s throat, showing his blood-stained fangs like a carnivorous beast, grinning at Magritte, and carelessly tossed Lysa aside.

The discarded Lysa trembled and groaned on the ground.

<b>

The man approached Magritte and reached for her body.

Sharp claws dug into Magritte’s chest, and a painful voice escaped her throat.

<b>

“So... at least! Entertain me to your heart’s content!! Hahaha!”

<b>

The man, Halbert East, with golden eyes shining, leaned in closer to Magritte’s face, grinning wickedly.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

Just as Halbert was about to sink his fangs into Magritte’s throat, he suddenly stopped.

<b>

“...Marina? What’s going on? What’s happening?”

<b>

Halbert looked up suspiciously, staring into the void.

He carelessly tossed Magritte aside and began walking toward the cave entrance.

However, he stopped mid-stride, furrowing his brow deeply once more.

<b>

“Electra? What’s going on? ...What is this? The soldiers have disappeared?”

<b>

He sensed that something was approaching, causing the soldiers to vanish.

Halbert instantly moved to the cave entrance and looked down.

<b>

He saw something that had invaded through the cracks of the Black Rock, blowing away the soldiers and approaching the center of the now-opened square below.

Halbert leaped into the air toward the approaching figure.

<b>

As he landed, his eyes glowed golden, fangs bared, and his magic sword drawn, he unleashed his aura upon the figure.

This must be the one who did something to Marina and Electra.

He wouldn’t let anyone who laid a hand on his women go unpunished!

<b>

However, the aura Halbert unleashed seemed to pass right through the figure as if it felt nothing.

Halbert focused his gaze on the figure and widened his eyes in surprise.

<b>

It was a young girl, not even of age.

Somehow, this girl was using some method to swing a spear and blow away the soldiers.

<b>

She was a girl with red hair.

The girl, with her hair shimmering like rubies in the light, noticed Halbert and grinned as if to say “I found you!” and charged straight toward him.

<b>

The girl, who bravely charged in, swung her spear at high speed toward Halbert.

The strike was sharp, unlike anything one would expect from a girl.

Halbert was momentarily taken aback, but it was the wrong opponent.

The one receiving the spear was the “Magic Sword Despairbringer.” There was no ordinary weapon that could match it.

<b>

Halbert thrust the magic sword he had been shouldering into the ground, meeting the swung spear head-on.

<b>

As expected, the spear shattered into pieces, unable to withstand the power of the magic sword.

The girl, who had swung her spear, opened her eyes wide in surprise as she spun in the air, watching the shattered spear.

<b>

Seeing this, Halbert smirked.

<b>

He could commend the girl for making it this far.

However, without a weapon, it was all over for her.

He could tell from her scent that she was still naive to the ways of men.

He could capture her like this and enjoy her along with the other two above...

<b>

But in the next moment, Halbert suddenly realized that the world had changed.

A pressure he had never experienced before, both physically and magically, assaulted him.

<b>

It felt like the claws of a giant dragon.

<b>

That power closing in on him was the last thing Halbert envisioned.

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

The spear shattered in an instant.

When I swung it, it had already fallen apart in my hands.

<b>

I messed up!

<b>

It was just like when I borrowed a sword from Papa Howard and accidentally broke it by infusing too much 'ki'!

In front of my target, I had put in more power than necessary.

<b>

The momentum from swinging the spear caused my body to spin in the air.

Right in front of me stood that loathsome being entangled with Papa Howard’s etheric body!

<b>

That’s right! At this point, I had no choice but to go all out!

I would crush this thing completely without leaving a single piece behind!

<b>

I released the remnants of the spear and took out my own weapon from my inventory.

The G-Zero weapon spear, “Nemesis Stormer.”

<b>

Its handle was thick and long, a rugged weapon.

Since it was the same type of weapon as my beloved Nemesis Dual Sword, the blade at the tip was thick and massive.

Once again, a pattern resembling the skull of a beast extended from the blade tip like veins.

The entire weapon was enveloped in a pale blue aura, crackling softly as the tip radiated lightning.

<b>

With this, I wouldn’t even need to use a skill.

There was no need to infuse 'ki' or magical power.

I just had to swing this with all my might!

<b>

As the Nemesis Stormer gripped in my hand spun in the air, I twisted my body further, compressing the air in an instant, creating a sound before I struck it down without hesitation against the loathsome sword embedded in the ground!

<b>

The compressed air turned into high temperature, striking the target like a massive hammer.

The superheated air turned into plasma, instantly blowing everything around me away!

<b>

The explosion of force spread around me, exceeding the speed of sound.

With this single strike, most of the undead on the northern side of the Black Rock turned to dust.

Of course, the loathsome sword was completely obliterated!

Now that I think about it, there was a vampire who held that sword...

Well! It was blown away along with the other bones, so it doesn’t matter!!

<b>

As I glanced around, the ground was gouged out, and the area around me for several dozen meters was hot, smoldering like charcoal.

<b>

<b>

...This is... did I go too far?!

N-no! There’s no problem!

The evil presence that had captured Papa Howard and the others is now completely gone!

I could sense that the condition of Papa Howard and the others stabilized as their etheric bodies were released!

Yes! There’s no problem at all!!

<b>

With a sigh of relief, the tension that had built up suddenly dissipated.

<b>

However! The matter is not completely resolved yet.

I hurried toward the two who were still emitting weak auras.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The two at the innermost part of the cave pierced by the Black Rock were still alive but in terrible condition.

<b>

I immediately treated them and restored their health, but I decided to leave them lying down, covering them with my cloak and putting them to sleep with magic for a while.

<b>

There was something else that caught my attention.

<b>

It was the large black chair that had been right next to Magritte and the others.

That grotesque object had something on it.

<b>

I stepped up to the platform and kicked the black chair, causing the grotesque object to shatter into tiny pieces.

Then, among the fragments, something fell.

<b>

At first glance, it looked like a staff, but it resembled some kind of creature.

It was a sinister object, with multiple snakes twisted together as if they had become one.

<b>

But it was definitely not a living creature. This reaction clearly indicated it was an object.

Moreover, it seemed to be a cursed item... yikes.

<b>

But I couldn’t just leave it here.

The malevolent energy it was emanating was extraordinary.

It was still smoldering, but it looked like it would soon overflow and cause a flood of miasma.

Either way, leaving it here would undoubtedly lead to something terrible.

<b>

I cautiously reached out and picked it up.

<b>

The dull silver body shone faintly, and its surface was indeed treated with fine scales resembling those of snakes or reptiles.

It seemed to have a high artistic value, making me think it might be worth something.

<b>

But the head part was unacceptable.

What was attached there were not snakes but multiple heads resembling the larval forms of some malevolent extraterrestrial creature, equipped with numerous needle-like fangs.

If I damage this, will it leak acidic bodily fluids and dissolve the floor like Styrofoam?!

<b>

While I was contemplating this, the staff (or whatever it was) suddenly began to move!

I had thought it might move, but it really did!

One of its mouths opened wide!

Ugh, how gross!!!

<b>

As it opened its mouth wide, it lunged at my hand holding the staff with incredible speed!

Other heads quickly joined in, and before I knew it, a large number of heads stretched out, piercing my entire body with fangs!

<b>

However, my body wouldn’t be pierced by those fangs!!

Even so, being gnawed at all over my body was definitely not a pleasant experience!

I grew increasingly irritated and, feeling like “You little brat!”, I unleashed my anger-fueled 'ki' from deep within my chest!

<b>

The mouths that had taken a serious hit from my 'ki' were blown away as if repelled from my body, shrinking as if the air had been let out, turning back into just a staff.

The miasma that had been leaking was mostly stopped.

Hmm? Did it get scared?

<b>

The overwhelming malevolence that had been overflowing just a moment ago seemed to have receded...

But how is it?

Even if it has receded, it’s still a dangerous item.

It was fine for me, but if it attacked an ordinary person like before, it would lead to something terrible.

I should definitely not leave this in a place where people can see it.

<b>

That said, I can’t store it in my inventory! It won’t fit!!

<b>

If only I could seal it... but I can’t do that!

This is something for Irta to handle.

<b>

I think it might be best to destroy it for peace of mind, but... In reality, this might be the only clue or evidence related to the root of this commotion.

<b>

The vampires who were likely the main culprits and the suspicious sword were already gone without a trace! Well! That can’t be helped! It can’t be helped!

So maybe I should leave this much behind...?

Well! If it comes down to it, I can pulverize it into tiny pieces!

For now, I’ll show it to Aria and Irta and seek their judgment.

<b>

<b>

...And there’s something else I need to ask Irta about here.

<b>

On the opposite side of the black chair where Magritte and the others were, four corpses had been discarded.

<b>

They were undoubtedly victims of the vampires.

Having been treated roughly, they were all stripped of their clothes, their faces pale and devoid of color.

<b>

Remembering the corpses I found in the pig village last year brought a pang of sadness.

Tears welled up from frustration.

I tried to cast resurrection magic, but there was no effect at all.

Death in this world is absolute.

<b>

<b>

I carefully arranged the four corpses and wrapped them in a blanket I took out from my inventory.

Please wait just a little longer.

I’ll bring Irta right away, and we’ll send you all off...

<b>

It’s impossible for me to carry all of them, including Magritte and Lysa, by myself in one go.

It’s best to have Aria and the others come here.

<b>

For that reason, I’ll clean up this area a bit more.

<b>

As I exited the cave, many undead were still writhing on this side of the Black Rock.

I had blown away a considerable number, yet there were still 2,000 to 3,000 left!

Seriously! Just how many were lurking here?!

<b>

I spun the spear above my head before taking my stance.

The weapon I currently held was a B-rank weapon, a spear called “Lancia,” which was red in color.

Since I couldn’t go overboard like with the G-Zero weapon, I would clean up with a weapon of a slightly lower rank!

<b>

Alright! Let’s quickly tidy this place up!

There are many of them, but compared to the time I dealt with nearly four digits with my bare hands, it’s much easier to blow them away with a spear!

<b>

I kicked off the ground, heading toward the horde of undead.

With a light swing of the spear, a red arc glowed, and dozens of bones shattered together.

Moreover, they were coming to me from the undead, so I didn’t have to worry about it!

<b>

As I cleaned up the black rocky ground devoid of trees, the red light blew away the standing undead one by one.

<b>

<b>

Just as I was finishing up, I sensed a powerful presence spreading on the other side of the Black Rock.

It was likely that Irta’s barrier device had been activated.

I could feel a very pure aura spreading deep and wide into the ground like clear water.

<b>

When I finished off the last undead, I saw the pure light rising on the other side of the black wall, and it was so, so beautiful.

<b>

Tomorrow, I will post the final episode.
