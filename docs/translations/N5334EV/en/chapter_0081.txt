# 76 The Red Eradicator

Thank you very much for your patience!

<blank>

Suzy Muso!


----------------

<blank>

At first, I had heard that it was a group of undead, so I thought all that was there were skeletons and zombies.

I had assumed that Elder Rich or someone like him was leading the group, because that's the kind of thing that was shown in the video I was shown.

<blank>

But when they entered my search area, I knew that was not the case because I caught a number of vampires.

<blank>

<blank>

The first one I found was a white vampire.

Moreover, three people, including one person I know, are dying from them.

<blank>

There are a total of 8 white vampires ...... Lesser Vampires that we saw.

All of them were dressed like white maids, on all fours with their limbs attached, with long red tongues extending from their mouths, which were slit up to their ears, licking off the blood of those who had fallen down with a giggle and a laugh.

That's how they keep their victims just barely alive and sipping their living blood!

They are truly fearless people!

<blank>

When the lesser vampire noticed me, it bared its fangs and made a threatening noise like a beast, trying to jump on me!

<blank>

Gathering "Ki" in the left hand that hangs down lazily.

The image is of a wet hand going down and water droplets collecting on the fingertips.

He swung his left hand lightly toward them.

As if drops of ki were flying from the fingertips, countless fine ki were shot at the Lesser Vampire at high speed.

The vampires dissolved into white particles and vanished into the atmosphere like soap bubbles popping.

<blank>

The mess has been cleaned up nicely, and now the only people in the wood are the three wounded Knights of the Order.

There is no blood on their skin, probably because they have all lost a lot of blood. But they are still alive!

<blank>

And yes! There he was, Mr. Djimon!

It's Mr. Djimon, who spent time in the village with Mr. Magritte and Raisa!

This Mr. Djimon is badly wounded. His shoulder is torn wide open, and he is bleeding badly from it. His lungs also seem to be damaged.

<blank>

《Chain Regeneration》

It is a healing skill that connects the target with a line of life force and restores the HP of all those on that line, and continues to restore life force for a short while in a sustained manner.

<blank>

While running through with Regulus, I unleashed this recovery magic on Mr. Djimon as fast as I could.

This magic doesn't recover up to MP, so you won't be able to move yet, but since everyone's wounds are fully healed, I'll let you go on, won't I?

<blank>

At this moment, I am sure that the priority of eradication against vampires has been raised one more notch.

<blank>

<blank>

As I went past Mr. Djimon and the others, the undead appeared in bits and pieces.

They are all bones, though! Some of them are cheekily wearing armor.

Crush it from the edges where you can see it!

With Regulus' hooves, he proceeded to pierce and crush it with his fangs.

The ones that were far away were blown away and crushed by my fist pressure with a small amount of Ki.

<blank>

Soon after, I came across a place where bones were gathered in a crowd.

<blank>

The walls are arranged in a circle, as if the ceiling of the dome had been cut away, and they are swarming.

Wow, it's kind of creepy, like a swarm of insects!

The wall is crumbling in places, but I'd say it's between 3 and 5 meters high.

<blank>

The overlapping undead are falling inside the walls, sometimes overflowing, but they seem to be intercepting them inside.

There are also a lot of zombie-like creatures with flesh on them, so it's like a zombie movie, which is scary!

Oooh! There's a pig! There are even pig zombies!

I'm 50% more scared, Kori haha!

<blank>

It's gross, and we're going to wipe it out!

<blank>

While drawing the silver sword backhandedly with his right, he puts "Ki" on the blade.

When Regulus' direction of travel is slightly to the left and his right side is facing the wall, he swings his sword at once and releases a shockwave with Ki on it.

<blank>

As if scattered by a gust of wind, the undead scatter and disappear into particles.

<blank>

Alright! We've now wiped out the undead as far as we can see! I'd say we've cleared nearly triple digits. There are more on the other side of the wall, but we've removed the obstacles in our path for now!

<blank>

Let Regulus run straight ahead and jump over the wall.

Regulus gained momentum and ran up into the sky as if he were flying.

As a side note, the undead in the area visible from the sky were also blown away by the shockwave from the left sword.

The knights guarding the north gate (?) looked like they were about to be breached. The knights guarding the north gate (?) looked like they were about to be breached, so I reaved them around there.

There were some big ones, but they scattered together, so I think we're safe for a while.

<blank>

While flying through the air, I found it! It's Papa Howard!

He was almost in the middle of this wall!

<blank>

Howard Dad!

<blank>

While Regulus was still in the air, I got off his back, jumped straight down toward Howard Papa, and clung to his body.

<blank>

Papa! Papa! Howard, Daddy!

<blank>

I kneel by the side of Howard Papa as he lies down, put my hand on his chest, and call his name.

He has terrible wounds all over his body and his face is completely bloodless!

His face was also in a terrible state, as if he had been dragged by something.

How could it be this bad?!!!!

My vision is unintentionally distorted by tears.

But my eye lids move slightly. He is responding to my voice!

<blank>

I'll help you right now at ......!

<blank>

I was in tears, but as soon as I called out to her, I used recovery magic.

<blank>

Vitality Release.

It is a skill of the divinized recovery job "Great Wiseman" that restores the HP and MP of all all allies around him at once.

Right beside me, Gilbert and Conrad were also lying down, wrapped in bandages, so we healed them together with this!

<blank>

Ripples of light spread all over the wall with me at the center.

Howard Papa, as well as Gilberto and Conrad, and everyone else inside the walls were enveloped in a pillar of light.

It's all right now! The scars on your face are disappearing as you look at them, and your blood color is returning.

And then Howard Papa's eye lids slowly went up.

<blank>

Dad! Howard Dad! Thank God. ......"

"............ Suzy ...... Ji? Is it ...... Suzy ...... or is it ......?"

<blank>

Howard finally opened his eye lids, squinted his eyes, looked at me, and said, "I can't believe it.

<blank>

<blank>

"In ............ dreams ...... are ...... illusions... ...is it not?"

I'm Suzy! It's Suzy! It's real!

<blank>

Papa Howard touched my cheek with a hand that he lifted without effort and murmured something like that to me.

I hold his hand and tell him it is real.

Oh, those strong hands are so weak!

My eyes were burning again.

<blank>

Even ...... is strange. Something is wrong.

Vitality Release" restores not only physical strength but also magical power.

Even if mana is depleted, it is also restored.

So why is Papa Howard still so frail?

<blank>

Once again, I checked the state of Howard Papa's fitness.

It is still strange. The upper limit of physical strength is fluctuating slightly.

<blank>

Vitality Release" is a short-lasting effect that lasts for a short period of time after it is used to restore strength.

The fact that the upper limit is fluctuating means that the skill continues to recover the reduced strength.

The wound is closed, but his strength is decreasing?

In addition, the magic power continues to decrease!

Why?

<blank>

"...... never thought I'd see ............ Susie here, ...... never thought I'd see ............ Susie here, ...... ...... I wasn't here. ......"

I am here! I'm here!

"...... my friend's resting place, my daughter will take care of me,...... or ............ my life will be ...... how fulfilling ...... will be my end. ......"

Oh no! I hate ......! It's the last time! Please don't say that!

<blank>

After Howard Papa said this, he closed his eyes and lost consciousness.

<blank>

Dad? Howard Dad! ...... will help you! I'll save you, I promise!"

<blank>

He was holding the hand of an unconscious Howard Papa, and he couldn't help but scream.

I noticed that the effects of sustained recovery had worn off.

I can see that Howard Papa's strength is dwindling rapidly. So are Mr. Conrad and Mr. Gilbert!

<blank>

Immediately use recovery magic.

《Field Greater Heel》

Healing magic that performs recovery at a range centered on the selected opponent.

This is another magic that has a sustained recovery effect.

<blank>

The spreading light of healing envelops both Conrad and Gilbert.

<blank>

The reduced physical strength has been fully recovered, but the upper limit is still fluctuating.

Is this a poison or some other condition?

<blank>

I chanted "Greater Purify" to try it out.

This is a high-level purification magic that removes all physical abnormal conditions, such as paralysis and petrification, not to mention poison.

A clean light rises up, enveloping Howard Papa.

<blank>

But no! The fluctuation of the upper limit of physical strength still cannot be cured!

What? What in the world is influencing you?

<blank>

"Hmm, I still think this is some kind of curse."

<blank>

Suddenly, I was approached from behind.

I turned around and there was an elf with long, beautiful blond hair and long ears.

I think it was a teacher of magical mechanics who was accompanying the survey team?

The half-elf sister behind her also nodded her head in agreement.

<blank>

Curse? If so, I used "Bright of Purge".

This is another skill of the "Great Wiseman" and is the highest level of magic that can remove all debuffs as well as curses.

Several rings of light appeared around Howard Papa, spinning and converging, and finally shattering and disappearing with a sound like shattering glass.

<blank>

But it's still no good, it won't change! You said it was a curse, Jean? !

I turned around and looked at the teacher again, not caring that the tears that had come to my eyes were splashing.

<blank>

"Hmmm, perhaps," he said. "Well, perhaps, but I feel that it is affecting a much deeper spiritual place. I don't think you can see it unless you look deeper and get to the source.

<blank>

The doctor said so quickly.

............ deeper? Spiritual? Turn to ...... eyes?

<blank>

I look at Howard Papa again.

Instead of seeing with your physical sight, try to expand your vision from deeper within yourself and see with your consciousness. ......

Yes, it's not the etheric body information you're always reading, but the etheric body itself in the field of consciousness. Go deeper and wider. ......

<blank>

When I looked at it that way, capturing the spiritual quality of Howard Papa, I noticed that there was something uncomfortable about it.

<blank>

The etheric bodies of the Howard Papas are thin.

What can I say, ...... is it solved?

<blank>

The unraveled ether runs from the body to the outside, like a thread, for a long time somewhere.

<blank>

It was the same for all three.

<blank>

The threads extending from all three are all heading in the same direction.

Yes, go north from here to .......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

----- I see! There it is! -----

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At about the same time that I discovered where the thread-like ether ended up, part of the southern wall collapsed.

<blank>

The people inside the walls seemed to be upset, but I could see them, the arias.

Aria and her friends caught up with them.

<blank>

It's been almost half an hour since you started treating Howard Papa.

<blank>

Aria and her team came inside the wall, breaking down the brittle part of the wall.

And there are no more undead on the south side.

<blank>

Since time is of the essence, I decide to finish what I have to do before welcoming Aria and her family.

<blank>

《Play of Genie Drum》

Increases strength and endurance by 50%.

The "Relishing Concerto" further increased the HP and MP of the Howard Papas, as well as their recovery speed.

<blank>

Furthermore, he raises his hand to the sky and snaps his fingers.

Samon Yggdrasil.

A huge seed falls from the sky above and instantly grows a young world tree.

If you stay in the shade of this tree, your strength and magic power will recover faster.

<blank>

"Summon Light Fairy.

The invoked fairy continues to heal the HP of the designated opponent at regular intervals.

The summoned fairy immediately began to heal Howard Papa.

Good! Now you're safe for a while.

<blank>

Ooooh? Oiii ............"

<blank>

Aria is sounding kind of crazy, isn't she?

Well, okay. I'll just ask AnnaMarie to come nearby for now.

<blank>

"AnnaMary ....... Can you help me with my dad, Howard?"

I'm so sorry. How is the ...... young lady?"

I'm going to go get rid of the source.

<blank>

I looked to the north and said a few words, and AnnaMarie smiled quietly.

<blank>

I will take care of the Master. As for the young lady, please use your power to your heart's content.

<blank>

And he said this while bowing deeply.

I gave a small nod and moved a little away from AnnaMarie and reached for one of the weapons that were stacked nearby.

<blank>

I'll borrow it, okay?"

"...... Oh, oh? Ah! Yes!"

<blank>

Nearby, Fred, the chief maintenance man, was there, so I said no and picked up one of the spears.

I heard that what you have here is a group of spare weapons that you have collected to give to the knights fighting on the front lines.

<blank>

I lightly shook the spear in my hand. It was about two meters long. It is quite light.

When I put it around my body, it feels good with the wind blowing through it.

Strength is about as low as D.

Well, this is about right.

<blank>

I held my spear, turned my head to the north, nodded my head to AnnaMarie, looked at Howard, and muttered, "I'm off.

Anyway, time was of the essence. I took a step or two, kicked the ground on the spot, jumped up, and hurried to the outside of the wall.

<blank>

The momentum of the jump up might have been a little strong.

I feel as if the impact of the "bang" was spreading.

The wind pressure ripped off his cloak, the hood came off, and his hair came undone.

But this is not the time to be concerned.

<blank>

The cloak flutters and makes a sound as it is rolled up by the wind.

My body was rising above the 15 to 6 meter high trees that grew wild around the wall.

And from there, he saw the target object.

<blank>

The distance from here is less than one kilometer. At best, it is 700 to 800 meters away.

There, a black wall stretches from east to west, blocking the road to the north.

<blank>

That's it, that's the "Black Rock".

<blank>

Like the long horizontal "Ayers Rock"?

Well, I've never seen Ayers Rock in person!

<blank>

As soon as I see the black rock, gravity pulls my body to the ground as I rise above the trees.

Looking around me as I descended, I saw that the undead, which I thought I had scattered, were beginning to gather again.

<blank>

I see several vampires mixed in among them. ......

In addition to the white lesser vampires that are ouzoing around, there are also several elder vampires.

But they can't be the enemy of Aria and her friends now.

Can we just eliminate the ones that are in the path of progress?

<blank>

As soon as his feet hit the ground, he kicked the ground toward the vampire about 100 meters away.

This time there is no one around, so I don't hesitate to kick the ground.

He broke through the sound barrier and the white cloud created by the compressed air, and in 0.3 seconds, he approached this guy and kicked him.

The pale-skinned guy looked surprised for a moment, but the next moment he exploded like a soap bubble and disappeared in a particle of light.

<blank>

I didn't need to bother with him, but the moment I saw him, I was so pissed off that I kicked him anyway!

<blank>

Before I could get my feet on the ground again, I put a small amount of "Ki" into the spear in my hand.

He then takes careful aim and releases the throw as soon as it lands.

<blank>

If we are not careful enough, we will even hurt that person who is being assembled.

To make sure not to make a mistake in addition to or subtraction, he throws a projectile so that it just barely grazes the target and starts running at the same time.

<blank>

The spear is aimed at the center of the target point and rotates to the left as if drawing a fan.

He pulls out his left silver sword and runs through the trees faster than he can throw his spear, kicking away and obliterating the undead around him.

<blank>

The trees in this area have thick trunks, but they grow quite sparsely, so I was able to blow away the undead in a big way without meandering so finely.

The spear reaches its target, crushing the undead in its path, and blows up the target.

As the spear was about to fly through, I went around in front of it and caught it with my right hand.

<blank>

When he catches the spear, the vampire who was blown away by it earlier rolls a bit forward and blows away.

The spear must have blown him away a little off the line of fire, because the spear snagged a little on the side of him.

The black dress she was wearing was torn off and her head was blown off. The Elder Vampire's body was sent flying with a thumping sound, rolling horizontally and vertically.

...... Is he only wearing a dress?

The dress is rolled up and all sorts of things are being dug out of it, but ...... well, I don't care!

More importantly, it's Kyle-sama! Master Kyle, who had been held back by the vampire, has little strength left!

<blank>

As I hurriedly approached, I caught a glimpse of your fallen figure on the ground, so I immediately released a recovery spell.

<blank>

《Bright Heel》

It is a recovery magic for a single person that instantly restores all physical magic power.

<blank>

It was a close call, but now we're all good to go.

I approached him further with a pat on the chest, and when I saw his figure again, ......!

<blank>

Hanyubyu?!!!!"

<blank>

I turned my face away from him as fast as I could and removed my gaze. I could see the blood flow rising to my face at a furious pace!

What the hell are you dressed like? Kyle-sama!!!!

Nyandesonnya koko skin kicked and moreover ............!

Gefun gefun gafun!

I remember that I used to have a familiar product, but! Now I am a maiden!

It's not good to see such a thing!

<blank>

At any rate, I picked up a fallen branch, hooked the edge of the cloak under Kyle-sama's body with it, and while trying not to look directly at the product, I quickly put the cloak over my lower body to hide it!

<blank>

Immediately after that, Master Kyle regained consciousness after his wounds were healed and suddenly tried to get up, so I hurriedly put him to sleep with magic!

What will you do if you get up and your cloak slips off?

<blank>

Psshhhhhhhhhhhh, a different kind of tension is released from the original one. ......

<blank>

<blank>

The next thing I knew, the vampire I had just blown up was getting up and coming to me.

I've added and subtracted so that it doesn't affect Kyle-sama. ...... I blew his head off and he's already grown a new one, he's really stubborn.

But the new face looks reptilian. Is it a snake woman?

<blank>

It's you! Was it you? I won't allow it, little girl! I won't let you! I'll wipe you off the face of the earth!

<blank>

Suddenly, they started screaming.

It's so noisy. ...... I wonder if all vampires are like this?

The snake woman raised her hands above her head as they were and began to converge her magical power in her upward-facing palms.

It soon became a fast-moving, spinning flame.

The flames became flaming bullets, and several were shot out in rapid succession.

<blank>

I point my left fist, which is filled with Ki, at the flaming bullet as if to thrust it out.

Then, with a snap, he opens his five fingers and sends his ki forward.

The numerous flaming bullets that came toward them were all instantly extinguished, like a match that has been blown out.

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Suzy Cloud, daughter of Cloud of Amukam, seeks and appeals to Salamander, the great fire guide. With his flame, strike down my enemies.

<blank>

With his open palm facing her, he chants a congratulatory prayer to the snake woman and releases his magic.

The snake woman, perhaps startled by the magical power converging in my palm, opened her eyes and flinched for a moment, but it was too late! The "Fire Bread" that I shot out roared out, vaporizing the snake woman in an instant! The "Fire Bread" that I shot out instantly vaporized the snake woman and created a thick path, chipping away at the surrounding trees and the ground.

In the distance, I could hear the sound of something being struck. ......

<blank>

..................Kuh, did you get laid too much ......?

YEAH! No one's here, so it's safe, right? Safe!

Yeah, I'm sure it's fine! No problem if you think you took a shortcut! No problem!

<blank>

<blank>

So, I thought I would just continue on my way, but it was too bad to leave Kyle in this state!

So I'll leave my escort behind.

<blank>

Sammon Cat-the-Cat.

It is a summoning skill of the initial magic profession, and the summoned summoner protects the magician and even heals him or her.

<blank>

A magic circle glowed on the ground, and a huge cat with a head as big as three heads and a body as tall as a human stood up on two legs.

They meow in greeting.

Ugly bastard!

<blank>

He wears big leather boots on his feet, a leather vest of the same color, and explorer-like goggles on his head.

And his hands are very big.

<blank>

'All right! I order the Nyantaro crew to escort Master Kyle!"

<blank>

Nyan! Cat responds with a vigorous salute.

Then it went on and started toddling off to the north.

Then, facing the undead that appear from among the trees, he hits them with a giant meatball punch!

The undead, hit with a brilliant jab, exploded and shattered as if they were exploding, and the armor they were wearing turned into particles of light that instantly disappeared among the trees.

<blank>

Mm-hmm! No problem at all!

The difference in combat power is overwhelming. There are still undead scattered around the area, but with Kat there is nothing to worry about.

Cat crosses her arms in front of her chest, then opens them tightly, as if to say, "Oshinushi!" and then opens them strongly, as if to say "Oshinushi!　and says, "Nyan-nyan!

Mmmmmm..! Isn't he cute? Koi tsume!

<blank>

I was tempted to mooch, but now is not the time!

We have to get this done as soon as possible!

Let's mofu as much as we want when the thing is over! Let's mooch all over it!

<blank>

This is not a problem for the undead in this neighborhood.

There's still one more Elder Vampire a short distance from here, but ............, yeah, Aria's on her way. Then you'll be fine!

<blank>

I left it to Cat and immediately started running toward my goal.

<blank>

The goal is black rock.

From there, we head for the point where the undead are overflowing like a wall, and push forward as if we were flying over the ground.

<blank>

The undead who blocked his way were lightly blown away by his spear.

A single swing of a spear can blow away a dozen bones, which are now nothing more than piles of dead branches.

<blank>

The target for elimination is already in front of us! I'll end this immediately!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was a place where the smell of death was thick.

The black rocks that surround the site have a bizarre shape, as if they were made of the organs of a living creature, giving the visitor an unrealistic sense of being contained within the womb of a gigantic organism.

<blank>

When Magritte Gauche came back to consciousness in a blur, what came into view was the black, ugly walls of the building.

Magritte's consciousness, which was gradually emerging from the space between dream and reality, perceived that this bizarre scene was real, without her body moving.

<blank>

Hey! You awake? Kuhaha!"

<blank>

Magritte's consciousness was quickly awakened by the sudden voice, and she tried to find the owner of the voice, but she could not move her body.

He feels his body, but he cannot move it, as if he has forgotten how to use his muscles.

I moved my head and eyes slightly and was barely able to catch the person in my field of vision.

<blank>

It was a man sitting in a black chair.

The throne is set on an ebony platform several steps higher than where Magritte lies.

The chair, constructed of black bones and formed of the same biological organs as the walls, was like a black, fearless throne.

<blank>

A dark-skinned man sat on a throne-like chair, resting one elbow on the armrest and resting his chin on his hand, looking down at Magritte with a hint of red in his eyes.

<blank>

............ vampire."

<blank>

Magritte, seeing the man's eyes, muttered.

I am convinced by the chilling presence the man wears and his red, insinuating eyes.

At the same time, Magritte finally began to become aware of the situation she was in.

<blank>

What has happened since then? Where are we? And who is this vampire?

<blank>

I'm not interested in getting a woman who's not conscious. Kuha!"

<blank>

The man then got up from his black chair and came stepping down from the ebony.

Magritte is once again aware of her body.

<blank>

He must have suffered a deep wound in his abdomen in the battle with that dark-haired vampire at that time.

But now there is a tingling in that abdomen, but no great pain.

When I turned my immobile head downward as best I could to see the wounds I thought I had sustained, I discovered that my chest armor had been removed, exposing my bosom.

<blank>

What? What is ......!

<blank>

The humiliation choked me for words. I tried to move my arms as quickly as I could to hide my chest, but the arms I relied on didn't even twitch.

The blood rises to my cheeks in anger, shame and humiliation.

<blank>

"Nice outfit, huh? Are you asking me out? Huh? Kuhahahahaha!"

<blank>

A man's laughter echoes from above my head.

<blank>

"......, you ...... what? What are you ...... doing? Aagh!

<blank>

The man grabbed Magritte's hair carelessly and lifted her to the height of his face at once.

<blank>

What am I going to do? Kuhaha! Of course we're going to eat it! We're going to take it and enjoy it! Huh? Kuhahahahahahahaha!

<blank>

The man grabs her by the hair with one hand and lifts her up, and Magritte's eyes, now with heightened vision, once again reflect her surroundings.

Raisa was lying right next to where Magritte was lying down.

<blank>

His mouth is covered with traces of blood, as if he had vomited blood, and his complexion is not good.

However, the chest is slightly up and down.

Magritte is relieved to see that Raisa is still alive.

Then where's Djimon? Where is he? Is he around here too? Is he safe?

<blank>

Magritte looks around in a panic to see if there are any other figures.

But what his gaze caught was .......

<blank>

You said, "...... Lisa? No way ...... no way?!"

Oh? I see, that's a face you know! Hahaha! They wanted to have more fun anyway, but it's been so long since I've seen them that I just ate them up in one night! Ha ha ha!

<blank>

There, Magritte saw four of his friends taken away in chains in the middle of the night.

On the other side of the black chair, they were all unclothed and discarded as if they had been eaten away.

<blank>

"...... like this ...... like this"

But we can still have fun after this! Kuha! We'll have a lot of fun later! Kuha! Kuha ha ha ha ha!

<blank>

A man looked fondly at the cast-offs, licking his tongue and laughing high.

<blank>

You are not satisfied with all this, and now you want to play with  even more? You have had enough of these girls, and now you want to ...... play with them even more? Can't you even respect the dead?

What are you talking about? What are you talking about? Who do you think I am? No one loves dead people as much as I do. Right? Kuha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Kuhahahahahahaha!

<blank>

The man lifted Magritte up further and crawled his long, red, reptilian tongue up her neck and licked it.

<blank>

What about you? You think you can entertain me? Huh? Show me some backbone, show me some emotion. Huh?

What? Ugh ......! Ugh ...... stop!

<blank>

The man, who had been watching Magritte writhing with amusement, suddenly turned his gaze to his feet.

<blank>

I'll take this one first: ....... This one is still new to me! Hahaha! If you get it right in front of you, you can enjoy it a little, can't you? Huh? Kuhahahahahaha!

<blank>

He looks down at Raisa, who is moaning softly at his feet, and then he throws Magritte down and reaches for Raisa.

Magritte, who was struck to the ground, let out a small cry of anguish, but immediately turned her stern gaze on the man with her body motionless.

<blank>

What are you doing to Lysa? You, stop! Stop it! Unh!

Ha." That's right! Let's make him indignant like that, don't you know! Kuhahaha!

<blank>

The man grabbed Raisa by the hair and lifted her up in the same way he did Magritte, and then went and crawled his red tongue around her neck.

<blank>

I'm like, "...... ugh! ...... What's ......? Agh? Aagh!"

La, Raisa!"

What's up? You awake? Oh, yeah! Just in time for a little fun, eh? I'm a little too worn out from all the fun I've been having. ...... I'm a little hungry! Kuha! Kuhahaha!

Stop! Raisa! Let go of Raisa! ...... Shit! Let go of me! Let go of me!

<blank>

Raisa regained consciousness and was in a mild state of panic when she recognized the man.

The man continues to tongue Raisa in a mocking manner, enjoying and toying with her screams.

<blank>

Magritte wriggles to move her body, but it does not respond to her wishes.

I can't stop the tyranny that is about to take place in front of my eyes, and I can only gnash my teeth and weep at my own inadequacy.

<blank>

Am I not ready for this?

Still can't reach him?

Surely he would not allow such tyranny!

No matter the predicament, he would never give up and would always save the people in front of him.

I haven't reached that guy yet. ......

That man's back is very ...... far away!

<blank>

<blank>

............, you knights are always so graceful, aren't you? You should be a little more dirty! They're so boring!

<blank>

As Magritte tried to make up her mind with a bitter look on her face, the man spat the words at her as if to say, "That's not funny.

<blank>

You should be so angry that you hate it so much that you break through it! Otherwise, it won't taste good, and most importantly, you won't be able to come back here after eating it! You can only come here when your anger and hatred break through and repeat! Ah?

<blank>

The man continued to speak in an exasperated manner.

His hand was placed on Raisa's neck, and his sharply outstretched claws gradually bit into her throat.

The man is sipping his dripping blood, while Raisa, his eyes narrowed in pain, laughs in satisfaction.

<blank>

It's been almost 100 years since I've owned Joel. I was hoping for something new this time when you said the Knights were your prey. ...... What a disappointment! Ha!

<blank>

The man slowly plunges his vicious fangs into Raisa's white throat. At the same time, Lysa's high-pitched screams echoed through the cave.

<blank>

RICER!!!!!!!"

<blank>

Magritte's screams echoed over Raisa's screams.

The man raised his face from Raisa's throat and smiled at Magritte, showing his fangs like a bloodstained predator, and threw Raisa to the ground.

Lysa, struck down, is moaning, her body shaking with the beating of her body.

<blank>

The man steps toward Magritte and reaches for her body.

Sharp nails dig into Magritte's chest, and a cry of pain is squeezed from her throat.

<blank>

So ...... at least! Let me have my fun! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

A man with golden eyes, ...... Halbert East, looked into Magritte's face and laughed fearlessly.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Halbert was about to sink his fangs into Magritte's throat when he snapped out of it.

<blank>

'...... Marina? What? What do you mean?"

<blank>

Halbert looks up quizzically and stares into the void.

Immediately, he threw away the magritte he was carrying in a messy manner and started walking toward the entrance of the cave.

But in mid-step, he stopped, and once more the crease between his brows furrowed deeply.

<blank>

Electra? What's going on? ...... What the hell is this? The soldiers are gone too?

<blank>

I can see that something is heading here, obliterating the soldiers.

Halbert instantly moves to the entrance of the cave and looks down below.

<blank>

There, something had entered through a gap in the black rock, blown away the soldiers, and could be seen looming in the center below, open like a plaza.

Halbert leapt into the air toward that thrusting something.

<blank>

As soon as he stepped on the ground, his eyes flashed gold, he bared his fangs, carried his own magic sword, and slammed his high energy into that something.

Perhaps this guy did something to Marina and Elektra.

I'm not going to let a guy who messes with my girl get away with it!

<blank>

However, he comes through Halbert's high spirits as if he feels nothing.

Halbert looked at his counterpart and his eyes widened.

<blank>

She is a little girl, not even a year old yet.

I don't know how she is doing it, but she is swinging her spear and blowing the soldiers away.

<blank>

It was a girl with red hair.

The girl, her hair shimmering like rubies in the light, spotted Halbert, her mouth turned up at the corners as if to say, "I found you!　She raised the corner of her mouth as if to say, "I've found it!

<blank>

The girl boldly jumped in and swung her spear at Halbert at high speed.

It was a sharp strike, not unlike that of a girl.

Halbert is momentarily blindsided, but not by the other party.

It is the "Magic Sword Despair Bringer" that receives the spear. It is not a weapon that can be used in a serious fight.

<blank>

Halbert thrusts the magic sword he carries on his shoulder into the ground and intercepts the spear as it is swung out.

<blank>

Sure enough, the spear that was struck could not withstand the power of the magic sword and shattered into pieces.

The girl who had swung the spear out of her hand spun around in the air with such force that her eyes widened at the sight of the shattered spear.

<blank>

When Halbert sees this, the corners of his mouth turn up in a grin.

<blank>

I commend you for having made it this far as a girl.

But without weapons, so much the better.

I can tell by the smell that she doesn't know any men yet.

I'm going to capture it as it is and have fun with the two above or .......

<blank>

But the next thing Halbert knows, the world has suddenly changed.

A pressure, both physical and magical, never before experienced, assails the body.

<blank>

It's like the claws of a giant dragon.

<blank>

The power that loomed over him was the last thing Halbert saw in his vision.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The spear shattered in an instant.

When he swung through, it was already falling apart from the hand.

<blank>

Failure!

<blank>

It was the same as when I broke the sword I borrowed from Howard Papa a while back by putting too much Ki into it!

With the target in front of me, I was just too focused on it.

<blank>

The momentum of the spear swinging through the air causes the body to spin in the air.

Even though there is an abominable presence thrust in front of us, entangling the etheric body of Howard Papa!

<blank>

Yes, I know! There was no way they could have chosen to go easy on me here!

This thing will be completely smashed here and now without a shred!

<blank>

I let go of the remaining spear fragment in my hand and pulled out my own weapon from my inventory.

It is a spear of the G Zero weapon, the "Nemesis Stormer".

<blank>

Its handle is thick, long, and martial.

It is the same quality weapon as the beloved Nemesis Dual Sword, so the blade at the tip of the spear is thick and huge in the same way.

A vein-like pattern extends from the relief like the skull of a beast to the tip of the blade.

The entire weapon is enveloped in a pale blue aura, and the tip of the ear is also clothed in lightning while making a small buzzing sound.

<blank>

This way you don't have to use your skills.

There is no need to put "Ki" or even magic power into it.

I just have to really swing this thing!

<blank>

The Nemesis Stormer, held in my hand while I was spinning in the air, compresses the atmosphere in an instant by my further twisting of my body, and strikes around without giving a sound to be heard.

Then, without hesitation, he slammed the sword into the ground with all his strength, which looked like it was made of weird-looking bones!

<blank>

In an instant, the compressed air becomes hot and becomes a huge hammer that strikes the target.

The superheat turned into plasma, which immediately blew up the entire area!

<blank>

The impact of the explosion spread around me, exceeding the speed of sound.

With this flash, most of the undead who were north of the black rock turned to dust.

Of course, there is not a shred of the disgusting great sword left!

Well, there was a vampire who had a kono big sword. ......

Well, I don't care! I don't really care, since it was obliterated along with the other bones!

<blank>

Looking around, I saw that the earth had been gouged out and the area around me, several tens of meters around me, was burning hot and smoldering like a charcoal fire.

<blank>

<blank>

............ this is ......, ya, did I overdo it?

No, no! No problem!

There is no trace of the evil entity that held the etheric bodies of the Howard Papas captive!

I can tell by the signs that the etheric body has been unleashed and the condition of the Howard Papas has stabilized!

Ummm...! There is nothing wrong!

<blank>

I feel as if the tension has been released all at once from a sense of security.

<blank>

However! Things are not all over yet.

I hurried to the two people I had been detecting, who were giving off a weak vibe.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The two men who were at the far end of the rocky outcrops drilled into the black rock were still safe, but in a terrible state.

<blank>

I healed it immediately and let it recover, but left it lying there, covered it with my cloak that I had removed, and put it to sleep for a while with magic.

<blank>

And there were some things there that I was interested in.

<blank>

It was a large black chair that was right next to where Mr. Magritte and his friends were.

Its sickeningly shaped, high backrest.

That guy is up there.

<blank>

He went up on the platform and carelessly kicked a black chair away, and the grotesque object suddenly scattered into tiny pieces.

Then, mixed in with the debris, it fell.

<blank>

At first glance, the object looked like a walking stick, but it also looked like some kind of creature.

It is an eerie creature, as if multiple snakes twisted and entwined into one.

<blank>

But definitely not a living thing. This reaction is clearly an object.

And it looks like a cursed item - yada yada yada.

<blank>

But I can't just leave this here.

The evil air, or rather, the air that is overflowing from this person, is unusual.

It was still smoldering, but it looked to me as if it would soon overflow and cause a flood of miasma.

Either way, there is no doubt that if we leave it as it is, it will not end well.

<blank>

With great care, I reached out and picked up the fallen object.

<blank>

The body, which shines dully in dull, light silver, has a surface treatment that looks like the fine scales of a snake or other reptile.

Is it possibly more valuable as a work of art? It is so precise that it makes you wonder.

<blank>

But the head part is not good enough.

The thing attached to it was not a snake, but a juvenile form of a vicious space creature, its head with numerous needle-like fangs intertwined with each other.

If you scratch this thing, it won't spill acid bodily fluids or something and melt the floor like styrofoam, will it?

<blank>

While I was thinking about this and observing the cane (?), it suddenly started to move! Then, it suddenly started to move!

I thought it was going to move, and it really did!

One of the mouths opened with a gasp!

Ooooh gross!!!!

<blank>

She opened her mouth wide and bit my hand holding the cane with tremendous force!

Other heads joined in, one after another, and I wanted to say, "Where was it? I wanted to say, "Where did it come from?

<blank>

But, well, I can't get those fangs through my body!

Still, it's never pleasant to have your body being shoved around!

I was getting more and more irritated!　I slammed the "Ki" of anger deep into his chest with all my might!

<blank>

The mouths of those who had taken a serious hit of "Ki" were blown out of my body and shrunk down to a mere walking stick, as if they had been sucked out of the air.

The miasma that was leaking has almost stopped.

Hmm? You scared?

<blank>

The overflowing sense of disaster that existed earlier seems to have receded, but I wonder if ...... is the answer?

Although it has gone into the shadows, it is still a bad product.

I'm glad it was me, but it would have been a big problem if I had attacked a normal person like I did earlier.

It is something that should not be left in public places.

<blank>

That doesn't mean I can't put it away in my inventory! This is it! And it won't fit!

<blank>

Maybe if I could do a sealed ...... thing, but I can't and .......

This is Iltar's domain.

<blank>

Is it peaceful to smash it? I guess. ....... In fact, this is the only thing I can find so far that might be a clue or evidence of the main source of the current disturbance.

<blank>

Because the vampires, who are probably the main culprits, and the dubious swords are the last remaining pieces of the puzzle! Duh! It can't be helped! It can't be helped! It can't be helped, can it?

So I guess I should leave this at least~? and .......

Well, I'll just have to crush them into tiny pieces when the time comes! If it comes to it, I'll just smash them into tiny pieces!

For now, I would like to show it to Aria and Ilta and ask for their judgment.

<blank>

<blank>

............ And there are other things that we need to ask for from Irta in Coco.

<blank>

Four bodies were dumped on the opposite side of the black chair from where Mr. Magritte and his family had been.

<blank>

There is no doubt that he was a victim of the vampire.

They must have been violently attacked, and they were all clad in white, with no blood on their faces.

<blank>

I am saddened to recall the time last year when we sent the body we found in the pig community.

I was so frustrated that I cried.

I tried chanting resuscitation, but the effect never appeared.

After all, death in this world is absolute.

<blank>

<blank>

I arranged the four bodies neatly and wrapped them in blankets taken from my inventory.

Please wait a little longer.

I will have Ilta send you all on your way immediately. ......

<blank>

As expected, I cannot carry all of you, including Mr. Magritte and Ms. Raisa, by myself at one time.

It is best to have Aria and her team come here.

<blank>

To that end, let's clean up this area a bit more.

<blank>

Leaving the cave, there are still many undead stirring on this side of the black rock.

I thought I had eliminated quite a few of them earlier, but there are still a couple of thousand of them!

Oh, my God! How many of them were springing up here?

<blank>

He spins his spear above his head and then takes a stance.

What he is holding now is a B-rank weapon, a red-colored spear named "Lancia".

You can't get too fucked with a quirky G-zero weapon, like you did earlier. ...... Clean up with a slightly lower ranked weapon!

<blank>

All right! Let's sass and clean up Coco!

There are a lot of them, but compared to the nearly four-digit number I had to deal with one by one with my bare hands before, I can blow them all up with a spear, so it's a pretty easy story!

<blank>

With my spear at the ready, I kicked the ground toward the horde of undead.

With a light swing of the spear, the red trail of the spear glistens as if a fan has been opened, and dozens of bones are shattered at once.

Moreover, they gather from the undead to the living, so there is no need for trouble!

<blank>

The red light blasts off, sweeping away the undead from one end to the other, as if cleaning up a land of black rocks with no trees.

<blank>

<blank>

When it was mostly clean, I felt a large spreading sign on the other side of the black rock.

Perhaps Mr. Irta's warding device was activated.

A very clean atmosphere, like the spreading of clear water, permeates the earth deeply and widely.

<blank>

The innocent light rising on the other side of the black wall that I saw when I finished clearing away the last of the undead was very, very beautiful.



<blank>

----------------

I will drop the final story tomorrow.

Next "Return of the Cloud"
