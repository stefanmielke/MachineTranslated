# Episode 08 Using Suzy Ki

I'm sorry, I was in a bad mood. I was thinking that maybe I could do the raid by myself since I was so cheat intense, even though it was just a dream. I thought I could do the raid by myself. I was on a roll! But I didn't know that it could be so powerful! It's beyond what a person can do! I think it's too much to destroy a mountain range even in a dream! Are you actually under a lot of stress to destroy something like this in a dream? Sure, there are many things that irritate me at work, but this much? Or is it frustration? I think I'm getting rid of a lot of my frustration here, but is it still not enough? Do you need more? Do you need more? If you tell me to do something, I will do it! Yes, because I like it! Because I like it! I'll do it more and more! I'm all for whoring around, bitch!

<blank>

Suzy seems confused.

<blank>

"All right, all right, all right!　Remember, this is a dream!　It's a dream!　It's supposed to be a dream!　So it's okay, I'm okay!　Don't worry, it's me!　Hang in there, me!

<blank>

They say they are trying to convince and come to terms with it anyway.

<blank>

<blank>

Now Susie was beginning her yukky-ukky descent.

For now, I thought I would walk around looking at the beautiful scenery to calm down ......, but it was not to be.

After all, the surrounding trees had all been reaped.

<blank>

My cheeks twitched involuntarily.

<blank>

Still, after a long period of mumbling to himself, he seems to have calmed down considerably.

Before I knew it, the surrounding area had become a forest with a decent stand of trees.

<blank>

The tree is standing.

I never realized that such a commonplace thing could be so reassuring.

<blank>

However, not all of the trees around the area are in good health.

Some trees have burned branches in places, and many have been bent and knocked down by flying rocks and trees.

<blank>

But such things are out of sight.

As long as you can't see it, the healing effects of forest bathing are perfect.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, we had come down to where there was no damage to the forest.

<blank>

Mobsters are beginning to pop up all around us, too.

The commotion must have involved a significant number of mobs, and their habitats must have changed.

But no matter what the situation, those who attack will attack.

<blank>

He shot down a huge bat that was still approaching.

The equipment has already been dropped to D, but it still blows up.

<blank>

As I looked at the Mob that went ballistic and the sword in my hand, I suddenly thought of something.

<blank>

(This impact system is flying "Ken-ki", right?　I've been doing it like when I'm playing a game, just putting in Ki without thinking, but now I can control it.　I've been doing it like when I'm playing a game, just putting in "Ki" without thinking, but ......, this can be controlled, can't it?　You can make it stronger or weaker. ...... (I know I can do that with the Ki I know, right?)

<blank>

I was thinking about this as I turned the sword in my right hand as if I was juggling with it.

<blank>

(I was taught that a long time ago. ......)

<blank>

And remembering the old days. ......

<blank>

...... to be sure."

<blank>

(Place the tip of the tongue at the base of the upper front teeth, relax and exhale slowly. (Put the tip of the tongue at the base of the upper front teeth, relax, and exhale long and thin like a thread.)

<blank>

I exhale and go quietly.

<blank>

(With this image in your mind, flow Ki into the sword you are holding, as if you were breathing out from your palm.)

<blank>

The arm hangs lazily and the sword is held with only a light grip and balance.

The weight of the arm and the weight of the sword are well understood.

<blank>

Warmth from deep in the chest flows down the arm, and it flows into the sword like a drip.

<blank>

He pauses for a long breath and lifts the sword in his hand to check its condition.

<blank>

White?　No, it's sparkling, so silver-white?　It's silver-white "Ki". It's like you're covered in syrup.

<blank>

The tip of the sword is pointed up and down, and you watch to see if it drips down, feeling the stickiness.

<blank>

Hmmm. Stable?"

<blank>

After confirming that it doesn't drip down, let your hands linger once again.

<blank>

Now we suck it in.

<blank>

Imagine that you are inhaling, as opposed to inhaling.

<blank>

The white silver that cloaked the sword gradually faded and finally withdrew cleanly and disappeared.

<blank>

"...... is ready."

<blank>

He muttered with satisfaction.

<blank>

I knew I could do it, but I didn't know I could do it this well. ...... and I could see Ki. I was impressed because I couldn't see it before!　Well, I guess it's not so much that you can see it with the naked eye, but that you know it's there, or that you recognize it.

<blank>

...... Well, you could have done it because it was a dream.

<blank>

I will not forget to add that.

<blank>

We then tried to manipulate the thickness, thinness, density and volume of the clothe.

How thin can you put it on? How much can you pour in? etc.

They changed weapon ranks and tried different things to make sure.

<blank>

The higher the rank, the easier it is to make precise adjustments, and the more cages you can put in, the higher the G. There's no ceiling on G. It's like you can put in as much as you want.

<blank>

Huh? I think of ...... by any chance.

<blank>

Can magic be done in a similar way?　It feels different from 'Ki', doesn't it?　...... When I use magic, I know that something is being drained. I'm not sure if it's possible to control the amount of magic used, either.

<blank>

I need to verify this too. ......, I think to myself.

<blank>

But let's try it out first. ......

<blank>

At first, I searched for mobs in the vicinity to test the control of "Ki".

<blank>

"I knew you wouldn't stay in the north direction, on top of the mountains. ...... We'll have to go south for now."

<blank>

A little further south from there, we found the giant bat we had encountered earlier.

Two to three meters above the ground, flying over a sparsely populated area with many fallen trees.

<blank>

'Senior Vampire Black Bat' - an old vampire bat, you say?　It looks nasty just by looking at the letters: ....... But, it's only 50 meters away?　That's out of their line of sight. Let's try to get a shot at it first. Let's aim first. ...... and release it like a sharp, thin needle!

<blank>

With the left leg pulled back and the right side facing forward, the right arm thrusts forward and the sword tip is aimed at the target.

A white line ran from the tip of the sword, piercing the target in an instant.

<blank>

"!　It didn't blow up!"

<blank>

I'm kind of glad.

<blank>

Check the condition of the bat that fell to the ground.

It is quite huge, with a body length of about 2 meters. Its wingspan is nearly 8 meters.

It looks a bit more like a pterosaur than a bat.

Because they are bloodsuckers, they have unusually large canine teeth and long noses, giving them a canine face.

<blank>

To use an analogy, he is a pig-nosed Doberman with bat wings.

In the center of her chest, a hole is pierced through which Suzy's head can easily pass.

<blank>

I knew it was a good thing that I learned to control it. I've been shooting at them in an uncontrolled manner! That's what I mean.

<blank>

and detected multiple beings approaching us.

<blank>

'Hmmm, I wonder if this move is another wolf type?　Is the number ......, 12......13?"

<blank>

They are gradually closing the distance to surround us.

<blank>

"Was he in a turf war with the bats?　Or maybe you smelled blood ......, or ...... you?"

<blank>

I winked, let my heart fly, and shook my index finger in my mouth as I said each word.

<blank>

It is a big miss!　It's a big miss "playing the new wife".

<blank>

He turns his head to the side, his cheeks a little tinted, as if aware that he has missed something.

There is nothing lonelier than a bokeh without a tskkomi, but it is a relief to know that no one is watching.

<blank>

I took off "The New Wife's Game," but that's the correct answer.

They were attracted by the smell of people.

<blank>

<blank>

After a while, ahead ......, we began to see a few wolves approaching from the west direction.

Four or five of them were approaching from the rear, but they were well hidden by trees and bushes.

<blank>

(I see... ......, if they intentionally show themselves and run away to the side where they are thin on the ground, they can ambush ......, or if they decide to go head-to-head, they can surprise and pincer the enemy...? ...?)

<blank>

I guess wolves think and hunt properly! He was always impressed with ...... and so on.

<blank>

The "Black Hellhound" - is it like a guard dog of hell?　About 3 meters long?　It's a lot smaller than the white one that was up there. ...... It's at least five ranks lower.

<blank>

Three meters in length is not small by any means. ...... There seems to be a slight discrepancy in the criteria for judging.

<blank>

Among the group, I found an individual that was one size larger than the others. There was no doubt that this was the boss.

Susie spotted him and started running toward him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The hellhounds, realizing that their prey was coming toward them, decided to intercept it.

The boss, who has increased his speed, leads the pack, leaving one body length of space in front and behind him, followed by the second and third horses on either side.

With three horses, they intend to attack in rapid succession.

<blank>

The distance between Suzy and me is closing as fast as I can see it.

The hellhound boss, who was in range, jumped on Suzy.

<blank>

He is going to aim for the throat, bite down on it, and push it down with all his weight on it.

Even if this move is lost, if a second or third move is made later and jumps on the posture that has been lost, the body can be dragged down as it is.

If we beat them, we win. The rest can be torn apart with many fangs.

The hellhound is pleased and confident of its prey's capture.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy was lurching just before contact with the hellhound.

Its body flexes as if its spine were made of flexible plate springs.

The right arm holding the sword was raised upward as if to open it from the chest, riding on its flexion.

<blank>

Now, the sword is clothed in a thin, thin layer of "Ki".

It is so thin that even those who can see it have to look very carefully to recognize it.

The edge of the blade was made to resemble a razor-sharp, thin blade.

<blank>

The blade passed through the hellhound's paws without any resistance and passed from the chin area to the back of the head.

<blank>

Huh?　I still have room to move. ...... I opened up my left arm in the same way.

This time, the blade passes from the base of the foot to the neck.

<blank>

You still can't move at all!　...... and raise your right arm again, which went around to the bottom as opposed to your left arm going up.

Further left, further right, left and right, left and right. ......

He swings his body as if he were doing a backstroke, alternating between his left and right arms and blades.

The light reflected off the edges of the building, forming streaks of light, enveloping Susie.

<blank>

<blank>

The thing that had been a hellhound jumped into the air with such force that it scattered the chopped-up flesh and blood all over the earth.

Suzy deftly avoids the splashes of blood as she chops the second and third hellhounds that come next in the same manner.

Yurari, yurari, as if dancing.

<blank>

<blank>

The remaining hellhounds do not understand what is happening.

The front runners are not in sight, something has scattered, but the prey is still standing.

Either way, the siege is done, it's a rat in the sack.

It's a good story if we can drive them away and hunt them down as they are.

<blank>

The remaining ten hellhounds closed the circle nicely and closed in on Suzy.

<blank>

A flash.

Suzy spun around on the spot and countless lines of light ran around her.

Just when it seemed that one more leap was all it took for the fangs to reach them, the hellhounds scattered into countless pieces of flesh.

<blank>

Wooooo ...... and exhale a little longer.

<blank>

I think I'm going to have to get used to the controls with the D equipment."

<blank>

By tying them down with less precise equipment, they are trying to increase their own control over themselves.

<blank>

　Yes, shields definitely have better protection. ......

<blank>

Thinking while touching different parts of my armor.

<blank>

I'd like to see how the amount of damage varies depending on the Ki that is applied to the body. ......　I just realized that I've never taken any damage so far!　Dumbass, huh?　Well, that said,......, it can't be helped that all the attacks haven't hit me!

<blank>

What should I do?　I crossed my arms and started thinking.

<blank>

The sun is already starting to set on ....... I've walked quite a bit. ...... I'll think about the damage assessment tomorrow. We need to find a place to settle down and prepare for encampment today!　For a safe and secure encampment, we need to clean up our surroundings!　To do it to the fullest!　It's better to be near a body of water where we can wash up quickly!　Let's find a place!　Let's find a place!　Let's find a place!　I'll quickly clean up and go straight into the blanketーーー!　Yee-hoooooooooooooo!

<blank>

For some reason, Suzy began to head south, jumping up and down with tension.

It seems that the policy after this has been decided. ...... Is it a quirk that there is no blurring in the decisions on the sitch side?
