# Episode 08: Suzie Uses Ki

"I'm sorry, I got carried away. Even if it's just a dream, the cheating is intense, so I was thinking maybe I could do a raid all by myself? I got carried away! But I didn't know it would be this powerful! It's beyond what a person can handle! I think it's too much to collapse mountains in a dream! If I'm causing this level of destruction in my dreams, am I actually quite stressed out? Sure, there are plenty of frustrating things at work, but is it to this extent? Or am I just feeling unfulfilled? I think I've been relieving some of that here, but is it still not enough? Do I need more? More?! If you tell me to do it, I'll do it! Yes! Because I love it! I'll keep doing it!! Hooray for lewd activities!!!"

<b>

Suzie seems to be in confusion.

<b>

"Alright! Remember, this is a dream! It's a dream! It has to be a dream! So it's okay! Relax, self! Hang in there, me!"

<b>

It seems she is trying to come to terms with the situation.

<b>

<b>

Suzie is now slowly beginning her descent down the mountain.

For now, she thinks about calming herself by walking while admiring the beautiful scenery, but that's not so easy.

After all, the trees around her have all been completely knocked down.

<b>

Her cheeks involuntarily twitch.

<b>

Still, as she continues to mumble meaningless soliloquies, it seems her feelings are gradually calming down.

Before she knew it, the surroundings had turned into a proper forest with trees standing tall.

<b>

The trees are upright.

Such an obvious thing was surprisingly reassuring.

<b>

Of course, not every tree around her is completely unharmed.

Some have burning branches, and many are bent or toppled over by flying rocks and trees.

<b>

However, such things do not enter her line of sight.

If they’re not visible, then the healing effects of forest bathing are perfect.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Before long, she had descended to a place in the forest that was undamaged.

<b>

Mobs have also started appearing around her sporadically.

With all that commotion, a considerable number of mobs must have been caught up in it, and their habitats have likely changed.

However, no matter what the situation is, those that attack will still attack.

<b>

She shot down a giant bat that approached her now.

Though she had already dropped her equipment to rank D, it still burst apart.

<b>

Looking at the burst mob and the sword in her hand, she suddenly thought of something.

<b>

(This impact type is sending out 'sword energy,' right? 'Sword energy' is that 'ki,' isn't it? Until now, I just did the 'ki' thing without thinking while playing games... but can’t I control this? Like make it stronger or adjust it... If it's the 'ki' I know, then I should be able to do it?)

<b>

While juggling the sword in her right hand, she pondered these thoughts.

<b>

(I was taught about this a long time ago...)

<b>

Recalling old memories...

<b>

"Let’s see..."

<b>

(Touch the base of my upper front teeth with my tongue, relax, and slowly exhale. Long and thin, like a thread...)

<b>

She exhaled quietly.

<b>

(Imagining it, I flow the 'ki' from my palm into the sword.)

<b>

Her arms droop limply, lightly gripping the sword just to hold its balance.

She feels the weight of her arm and the weight of the sword clearly.

<b>

Warmth flows from deep within her chest into her arms, dripping down into the sword.

<b>

She stopped her long breath and slowly lifted the sword in her hand to check its state.

<b>

"White? No, it's sparkling, so it's probably silver? It's 'ki' of silver. It feels like it's wrapped in water candy."

<b>

She raised the sword tip up and then down, checking to see if the viscous substance would drip.

<b>

"Hmm, seems stable."

<b>

Confirming that it didn’t drip, she let her hands drop down again.

<b>

"Now, I'll breathe in."

<b>

She took a deep breath, imagining it in reverse from earlier.

<b>

The silver wrapping around the sword gradually thinned, and finally, it completely vanished.

<b>

"...I did it."

<b>

She murmured with satisfaction.

<b>

"I thought I could do it, but I didn't expect to do it this well... I could even see the 'ki.' I couldn't see it before, so it's a bit moving! Well, in reality, it's more like I 'know it's there' or 'I'm aware of it' than actually seeing it, right?"

<b>

...Well, I suppose it could only happen because it's a dream.

<b>

She didn't forget to add that.

<b>

After that, she tried manipulating the thickness, thinness, density, and quantity of the 'ki' she wrapped around.

How thin can she wrap it? How much can she pour in? 

She changed the weapon rank and tested various things to confirm.

<b>

"The higher the rank, the easier it is to make precise adjustments, and I can put in more. Rank G seems limitless, as if I can pour in as much as I want."

<b>

Hmm? She thought of something.

<b>

"Can magical power also be done similarly? It feels different from 'ki,' but... When I use magic, I can tell something is being consumed. Can I also adjust the amount used?"

<b>

This also needs verification... she muttered to herself.

<b>

"But first, a test shot..."

<b>

To try controlling her 'ki,' she looked around to see if any mobs were nearby.

<b>

"Looks like there aren’t any in the northern direction, up on the mountain... For now, I have to head south."

<b>

After going a little south, she discovered the giant bat she had encountered earlier.

Flying at a height of 2 to 3 meters above ground, in a place where many fallen trees were sparse.

<b>

"A 'Senior Vampire Black Bat'? An old bloodsucker? Just looking at the name, it seems troublesome... But, the distance is about 50 meters? That's outside its detection range. Let's aim for it first... thin and sharp, like a needle... fire!"

<b>

She positioned herself by drawing back her left foot and pointing her right arm forward toward the target... and released the sword energy.

A white line shot from the sword tip, piercing through the target in an instant.

<b>

"Oh! It didn't burst!"

<b>

She felt a little happy.

<b>

She checked the state of the bat that fell to the ground.

Its body length was about 2 meters, quite huge. Its wingspan was close to 8 meters.

Rather than a bat, it resembled a small pterosaur.

Being a blood-sucking species, its canines were abnormally large, and it had a long snout, resembling a dog.

<b>

If she had to describe it, it would be a doberman with bat wings and a pig snout.

Right in the center of its chest, there was a hole large enough for Suzie's head to easily fit through.

<b>

"It penetrated beautifully; learning to control this was definitely the right choice. Just think of how disorderly I've been blasting away before!"

<b>

She sensed multiple presences approaching her.

<b>

"Hmm, this movement... is it another wolf type? The number is... 12... or 13?"

<b>

They were gradually closing in on her, surrounding her.

<b>

"Were they fighting for territory against the bats? Or did they catch the scent of blood... or perhaps... me?"

<b>

She winked and blew a heart, waving her index finger in front of her mouth while saying it.

<b>

That was a total miss! A big miss at 'newlywed play.'

<b>

Realizing she had missed, she blushed slightly and looked away.

There’s nothing lonelier than a joke without a comeback, but at least no one is watching, so that’s a relief.

<b>

Even though she missed with her 'newlywed play,' the truth is that.

They had gathered due to the scent of a person.

<b>

<b>

After a while, she began to see several wolves approaching from the front... from the west.

From behind, about four to five wolves were also approaching together, cleverly hiding themselves behind trees and bushes.

<b>

(I see... They intentionally revealed themselves and escaped to the less guarded side, preparing an ambush... Or if it came to fighting head-on, they would rush in from both sides... right?)

<b>

Wolves really do think about their hunting strategy... she was continually impressed.

<b>

"A 'Black Hellhound'? Feels like a hellish watchdog? Its body length is about 3 meters? Compared to that white one above, it's considerably smaller... Feels like it's five ranks lower."

<b>

Three meters in body length is by no means small.

<b>

It seems her judgment criteria have slightly skewed.

Among the pack, she spotted a larger individual than the rest. This one was definitely the boss.

<b>

<b>

<b>

With that in mind, she took off running toward it. The hellhounds, noticing that their prey was approaching, decided to take her on.

With the boss in front, they quickened their pace, maintaining a body-length gap between each other, while two others ran alongside.

The three of them intended to attack in rapid succession.

<b>

The distance between them and Suzie quickly closed.

The boss hellhound, now within range, lunged at Suzie.

<b>

Aiming for her throat, it intended to bite down and push her to the ground with its full weight.

Even if she dodged this, the second and third would jump in as soon as it lost its posture, easily dragging her down.

If they brought her down, it would be their victory. All they had to do after that was tear her apart with their many fangs.

The hellhounds were confident in their capture of their prey and felt delighted.

<b>

<b>

Just before contact with the hellhound, Suzie swayed gently.

Her spine bent as if it were made of flexible springs, making her body curve.

Using that sway, she raised her right arm holding the sword up toward her chest.

<b>

Right now, the sword was wrapped in a very thin layer of 'ki.'

Even someone who could see it would have to look very carefully to notice how thin it was.

And at its edge, she had wrapped it with the image of a razor-sharp blade, thin and sharp.

<b>

The blade passed effortlessly through the hellhound's front leg and through the area around its jaw to the back of its head.

<b>

Huh? There’s still some movement left... she thought as she raised her left arm similarly.

This time, the blade passed from near the root of its legs to its neck.

<b>

I can still move plenty! ...While thinking that, she lifted her right arm, which had been lowered.

Left, then right, left and right...

She swayed her body as if doing the backstroke, alternating her arms and the blades.

The light reflecting off the edges formed multiple lines that enveloped Suzie.

<b>

<b>

The thing that used to be a hellhound was scattered in a flurry of blood and flesh from the force of her attacks.

Suzie skillfully avoided the splatters of blood as she sliced through the second and third hellhounds that came next.

Swaying and dancing as she went.

<b>

<b>

The remaining hellhounds did not understand what was happening.

They couldn't see their fellows at the front, but it seemed something had splattered, yet their prey was still standing.

Regardless, they had surrounded her; she was like a trapped mouse.

All they had to do now was chase her down and capture her.

<b>

The remaining ten hellhounds neatly closed the circle around Suzie.

<b>

With a flash.

Suzie twirled around, and countless lines of light danced around her.

Just as it seemed the fangs would reach her with one more leap, the hellhounds scattered into countless pieces.

<b>

Huff... she exhaled a little longer.

<b>

"I can use this even better than I thought. Should I get used to controlling it with D rank equipment from now on?"

<b>

By putting herself under constraints with low-precision equipment, she intended to enhance her control abilities.

<b>

"Is the strength of my armor changed by adding 'ki' as well? Yes, the shield definitely increases defense..."

<b>

She thought while touching various parts of her armor.

<b>

"I want to verify how damage changes with the 'ki' I wrap around... Oh! Wait, I just realized that I haven't taken any damage so far!! Am I an idiot?! Well, given that none of the attacks hit me, it can't be helped!"

<b>

Hmm, what should she do? She crossed her arms and began to think.

<b>

"...The sun is already beginning to set. I’ve walked quite a bit... I’ll think about damage verification tomorrow. For now, I need to find a safe place and prepare to camp! I need to clean up the area for a safe and secure camp! I want to do it thoroughly!! It’s definitely better near water so I can wash up easily! Alright! Let’s find a place! Let's decide on a spot! Let's clean it up quickly and head straight into the blanketsーーーー! Yayーーー!!!"

<b>

For some reason, Suzie began heading south while bouncing with high energy.

It seems she has decided on her next course of action... but is there really no wavering in that decision?
