# 104 Noisy Dining Table

On the table is an onion soup that looks simple but is wrapped in an aroma of depth

The sweetness and flavor of the onion spreads throughout your mouth as you chew the soup.

It has a really deep flavor that clearly shows the careful work that has gone into it.

<blank>

And the main course of today's lunch is roast beef!

The meat is cut into thick slices, and the beautiful, shiny rosemary-colored cross section is dipped in a rich, red wine shaliapin sauce. It's a great dish to eat!

<blank>

Oh, the chef here is really doing a good job. Thank you ...... for this bliss.

<blank>

Gratitude, and yet it is .......

Oh, and yet, and yet!

<blank>

I keep calling you day in and day out, why won't you come? I've been calling you day in and day out, why won't you come?

<blank>

Even though we are having such a wonderful lunch, please visit .......

Even as I am chewing on this blissful moment, I'm still ....... This angry voice ......!

Do you want to be grilled on a griddle every day or something?

Tactless! It is indeed tactless!

<blank>

<blank>

You ignored my calls yesterday and the day before, you son of a bitch! Do you know what happens when you disobey me? You!

No? I have no idea?"

'F-fuck you! You son of a bitch! I'm the one who called you! You had every right to come!

No, I don't know. I don't have anything to do. I don't have time like you.

You! You son of a bitch!

If you have something to do, why don't you come to me first? Who would come to me without telling me what they want?

Te, te, te!

You are a member of the old aristocracy, aren't you? Then, first you ask, "When and where would you like to meet me for this and that? and only when you get a reply of approval, you can make an appointment, right? Isn't that the way of the aristocrats? And yet, they don't even ask. You don't even wait for a reply. I called him! They don't come to the place! You know how to get an appointment? Do you know how to make an appointment?"

"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You! Do you have any idea what you're up against?

What's your position? Position? I'm with you, right? I'm a first-year student.

<blank>

Wow, wow, wow. Irving, that Irving, is saying something right?

What's up Irving? What happened? Did you eat something weird?

The other party is about to snap out of his/her head! No, they've already snapped!

There's never been a trial where a good argument made the world happy, you know?

Who taught you such an advanced method of getting people to fight with you by arguing righteously?

Oh, Vivi.

<blank>

And the one with steam coming out of his head is the second son of an old baroness from the second group Grouse Mill, the Nantes of the Niven family. He is the little boy in question!

The second son is accompanied by two male students who seem to be his cronies, but these two are the same as the second son in that they are yapping and screaming, but they have not laid a hand on Irving.

<blank>

The dining room table we are sitting at now is a large one that seats eight on each side and can be used by sixteen people. It is made of a single thick piece of walnut wood, and its dark brownish-brown color makes it an atmospheric gem.

I am sitting almost in the middle, with Mia to my left and Bibi next to her. Karen is on my right, by the way. Lombardo is sitting over Bibi, and Irving is sitting next to Lombardo at the end of the table.

Surely the reason the cronies are with the second son and won't touch Irving is because Lombardo is sitting on the other side of Irving, whom the second son is holding on to.

Lombardo has a lot of pressure just sitting there!

<blank>

Hmm? If you look closely, you can see that Miss Lurie is also quite close by, watching this slapstick drama with her arms crossed.

He looks stern with his eyebrows raised, but even the quintessential Miss Lurie won't bite until Irving. ......

<blank>

When I looked at Karen, who was right next to me, she still looked worried, so I smiled at her and told her it was okay, but what came back was a weak smile.

I'm going to blow this second son out of the sky if he tries to mess with Karen in front of me.

<blank>

But still, I know he's all bloody in the head, but doesn't this guy realize the difference in power between himself and Irving at all?

He's been trying to grab Irving's shirt for a while now, and he wants to shake it up and wiggle it, but Irving's body hasn't twitched at all.

Rather, I found myself swaying every time I moved my arms.

Irving's body looks relatively slim, so he's licking his chops for looks?

This might not have been the case, though, if he had a body as big and thick as Lombard's next to him.

<blank>

Get up, you son of a bitch! Every time you get up and run away from me, you just keep on running away! Today is the day I'm going to show you the difference in power between you and me!

<blank>

Oh, I guess I can't. My head is so sorry.

<blank>

So, how long is Irving going to keep this charade going?

I'd rather enjoy my lunch in peace and quiet.

It is a bit frustrating to keep hearing such an unpleasant voice during a meal time.

The deliciousness of the roast beef is reduced by half!

<blank>

I know you're probably running around sneaking around because you're scared of me, but today is the day I'm not going to let you get away with it! I'm going to beat you right here and now and show you who's better!

"Oh, no, that's okay, you win, I lose. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

You, you, you, you, you, you! Don't fuck with me! Gorraaaaah!!!!"

I told him it was my fault. I'm sorry.

I'm not kidding, am I? You little bastard!

<blank>

Ooooh, this is no good.

Hey, Irving! I want this to be over as soon as possible!

What are you going to do, pouring kerosene all over the fire? You know it's going to be a hassle. Damn it! At all!

At mealtime, of all times! I can't believe you're making a scene at this table! Read the air a little! I want to say!

Again, I want to enjoy a leisurely lunch!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What's that ......? I feel like Mia sitting next to me, Bibi on the other side, and Kara and the others sitting in front of me are looking at me. ......, what is it?

Oh, before I knew it, I was unconsciously tapping the table with my fingers. I used three fingers and tapped, tapped, tapped, tapped. ......, is it because of this?

I'm sorry, that was a bit unbecoming of a lady, and I think I behaved in an unbecoming manner.

Oh, Lombardo and Irvin also saw Koch.

Ahem, cohon. I stopped tapping my hand for a second, brought it up to my mouth, and coughed lightly and cutely. ...... No?

<blank>

At ......, Carla, sitting in front of me, offered me her lunch dessert, a pear custard tart, saying, "Would you like some?" and offered it to me. Eh? Is it good?

<blank>

Oh, I'm sorry! I don't know what's going on here, so why don't we change places? If you want, we can go to the back of the school building, which is your favorite place. Let's go that way! That way! Hey!

"Hey, you! You! You're still trying to play with me, aren't you? You're going to sneak away like that again, aren't you? You son of a bitch!

I'm not going to run away! I'll go out with you! So let's get out of here for now, okay? Right?

You know, you're a ......! I know you'll run away again like that! That's not going to happen!

That's why I ain't running away! You still don't listen to me, do you?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oi! You guys! You're making a scene here again!"

"......ge."

Tsk!"

You guys are outrageous! You people are ...... outrageous!"

No, no! Sempai. I was just about to do something about it. ......"

Don't make excuses." Haggard! And Colin! You're you too! There's a disturbance happening right in front of you! As a member of the student council, don't you think you ought to try and contain it?

I'm sorry, Fritz. You're right. It is the duty of seniors to admonish the junior staff who go too far.

Do you really think ......?"

'I'm serious, okay? I'm serious about it. ...... But look at them. Don't you think it's too much for me, a frail girl, to deal with all these energetic boys on my own?"

"............"

I'm really glad you're here, Fritz," he said. Take care of me, Fritz.

"......, you're the one."

<blank>

The noise was so loud that it was sure to draw attention. Tall senior staff members with stern expressions came to our table.

Are these seniors Colin's colleagues? Are they on the same student council? Their shiny, thin glasses make them look like "strict seniors!

But what can I say, is it my imagination that it seems to exude a hard-working persona?

The senior called Fritz seems to be asking Colin why he is not admonishing him for this disturbance. ......

I know...I know...I know! Colin is ......, no, not just Colin, Kara, Alicia, and all the Amcam sisters in Coco are amused by this exchange!

It was troubling to see how Irving would respond, nimble as he was!

For the most part, Colin is a heavy load, but there are few at the table who really believe such words!

Furthermore, Fritz and Colin are shining their glasses at each other! It looks as if they are having some kind of magic battle with their glasses!

<blank>

Damn it, damn it, damn it! They're all fucking kidding me! They make fun of me! They're licking my chops! I'm so ...... much like you! Hey! Haggard!

Oh? What? You finally decided to move on from here?"

"Haggard! I challenge you to a duel! This is ...... what you promised me, right?

What are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about?

Oh?"

What? What a stupid thing to do!!!!"

It's a real fight between you and me! Don't run away from me! Haggard!

What are you talking about? What are you talking about?

<blank>

What's that little Niven family boy talking about? Is he saying something about a "duel"? Even Miss Lurie sounds surprised.

Is there such a thing as a "duel" nowadays? And on campus? Are students allowed to fight each other?

Dueling is just a leftover from the days when the aristocracy existed, isn't it?

I think it's a bit of an anachronism to pull something like that out nowadays.

<blank>

<blank>

Fritz, don't you think this is a place where these kids deserve some autonomy?"

What are you taking so long for, making such a big deal out of this? Hey! Haggard! You're not seriously going to accept a duel, are you?

No, I have no intention of doing that. ......

You bastard! You still want to run away at this point? You coward!

You know, Irving, I'm getting all these appeals. You're getting such an enthusiastic appeal. Why don't you go out with him a little?"

What? What are you talking about, even Kara!"

Edgarra senior! You, too, stop your funny provocations!"

I'm sorry, okay?"

<blank>

Jessica, sitting next to Kara, who is agitating in front of me, leans over here a little and tells me, "You need the school's permission to have a 'duel'," so it's not an easy thing to do.

I heard that it is necessary for both parties to agree to submit an application, which can be implemented once it is accepted and approved by the student council .......

It sounds like a very complicated government procedure. Even if my blood is boiling, it might cool down while I'm filling out the application form. In fact, that might be the aim.

<blank>

"Ha! I heard that your village is called a group of professionals in exterminating demonic beasts! Exterminating magical beasts is just vermin extermination! The actuality that you can be a professional group of monster exterminators is just a vermin exterminator! What?

What?"

Hey! Niven! You've had enough!"

"You're a vermin exterminator! I'm going to make you regret standing up to me! I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

<blank>

In order to duel, he says, both sides must first agree, so Irving has to say 'I accept.

However, Irving never said he would accept the offer.

So this second son is trying his best to provoke Irving to accept the duel.

<blank>

But still, "vermin control" hey .......

In a land without magical beasts, the Amkamu Protectorate must have such a reputation, I guess.

Well, it's just the way it is, isn't it? It's impossible to understand something that doesn't exist, and even more so if you don't even try to understand it.

It is also bothersome to explain in detail to such people. It is simply a waste of time.

So there is no one in Amkam who can handle this level of incitement. This is not even a provocation.

I mean, if you are going to get cut off by this kind of stunt, I think you need to be punished a little bit later on.

If Irving gets hot under the collar at this level of provocation, I will beat him mercilessly!

<blank>

"Hmm? What's up Haggard?"

Oh, no, no, a little chill? is ......"

<blank>

Reilly! That's enough ......"

<blank>

Miss Lurie approached the second man and stopped moving when she turned her attention to this table.

<blank>

Karen?" What are you doing here at ......? What are you doing at this table?"

"......!!!!"

<blank>

Damn! Oh, shoot. I had adjusted my sitting position so that Karen's figure would be in the second son's blind spot, but Miss Lurie, who came up to the table, caught her in her perfect view. I failed!

<blank>

"Karen? Karen? !"

"It's all your fault ......!

<blank>

"Karen! You're sneaking around, running away from me! You bastard! Don't play with me, you son of a bitch!

<blank>

The loud voice raised by the second son of the Niven family made Karen's body jump with a start.

<blank>

The next moment, a hammer swung down as hard as it could from the thick wood table in front of me, and a high pitched, hard sound, as if it had struck the hard core of the wood, roared through the area.

The sound spread to every corner of the cafeteria, and then the dining room fell silent as if it had been drowned.

The lingering sound slowly seeps into the high-ceilinged space.

<blank>

<blank>

In the quiet of the space, I sit in my chair, my right hand on the table from the elbow up, and turn my attention to the rowdies who have been fussing at the edge of the table.

The three fingers of my right hand on the table seem to fit oddly on the table, but it must be my imagination.

The eyes of the ladies sitting in front of me seem to widen and stare at the table where my fingers are placed, but I am sure this is just my imagination.

<blank>

I did not pay attention to such a trivial matter and said a few words to those who turned my attention to them.

<blank>

"Irving, I think it's time we put this whole mess behind us, don't you?"

<blank>

I quietly put a smile on my face so that my face would not be expressionless. It's called an archaic smile.

Irving turns his head toward us and nods silently.

<blank>

<blank>

"............ Oh, argh? What the hell? What are you? What the hell did you just side step me?

<blank>

I was stunned for a moment, but my second son noticed me right away and started shouting at me.

Then, two of her cronies and Miss Lurie came up to her in a panic and whispered something in her ear. Miss Lurie's eyes are very serious.

They whispered around and said, "What? Amcam's? This guy?" I don't mind the déjà vu of my second son mumbling, "What?

<blank>

As they look at me with a rude gaze, I say, "All right," and tilt my head a little.

<blank>

Ha! What? You mean the head of the vermin exterminators? That's where you've been hiding out with Karen! You're sneaking around with your head! Is it any wonder Haggard is on the run? Ha-ha-ha!

"............"

What the hell? I said I can't talk to you because Haggard is sneaking around! What are you going to do about it? What are you going to do? You're the head of this guy, aren't you?

<blank>

The second son turned to us and began to breathe.

It looked like it was about to come this way, but Lombardo moved his body slightly and interrupted its line of movement, so it couldn't make a move. Nice! Lombardo!

<blank>

I take my right hand off the table and place it on top of Karen's hand, keeping my eyes on my second son.

<blank>

Ha-ha-ha! If you want! You can take Haggard's place and play with me, you know? What? Hey!

<blank>

Heh~ ...... yeah?

<blank>

...... does that mean you want me to be your dueling partner?"

<blank>

At that moment, the air around the table at which we were sitting stirred loudly.

I feel like everyone's eyes are wide open.

Carla's eyes ask, "Are you serious?" I asked. I heard someone clearing their throat. I think I hear something like, "That's a quirky ...... thing," or "Worse than mincing ......?" I thought I heard something like, "We need to disinfect it," but I still didn't care.

<blank>

For the time being, I let such a surrounding atmosphere pass, stared at Irving again, and showed him a small tilt of the head.

<blank>

This duel is respectfully accepted by Irving Haggard, the third son of the old Baron Haggard, one of the Twelve Knights of Amkham.

<blank>

After Irving looked me straight in the eye, he stood directly in front of the second son and, like a knight, announced his acceptance of the duel in high spirits while placing his right hand on his chest.
