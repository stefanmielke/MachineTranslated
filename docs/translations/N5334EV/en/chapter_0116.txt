# Chapter 104: Noisy Dining Table

On the table is an onion soup that looks simple but is enveloped in a depth of aroma that suggests richness.

As I savor the soup, the sweetness and umami of the onions spread throughout my mouth.

It's clear that a careful job has been done; the flavor is truly profound.

<b>

And the main dish for today’s lunch is roast beef!

Thickly sliced, the glossy and beautiful rosemary-colored cross-section, when tossed into my mouth with the rich, red wine-infused Shariapin sauce, releases a fragrant aroma of roasted goodness along with the scent of vegetables and herbs, and with each chew, the abundant umami of the meat juices, which had been firmly sealed, bursts forth in my mouth!!

<b>

Ah, the chef here really does an excellent job. I am grateful for this blissful moment...

<b>

Even though I am grateful, still...

Ah, still, still!

<b>

“Why the hell are you not coming even though I've been calling you every single day?!!!”

<b>

Even though I am enjoying such a wonderful lunch...

Even though I am savoring this blissful moment... this angry voice...!

Does he want to be grilled on the iron plate every day?!

How uncouth! Truly uncouth!!

<b>

<b>

“You ignored my calls yesterday and the day before, you bastard!! Do you know what happens if you defy me?! You!!”

“No? Not at all, I don’t know?”

“Don’t mess with me! You!! I’m the one calling you! It’s only natural for you to come!!”

“No, I don’t know. I have no business with you. Besides, I’m not as free as you are.”

“You! You bastard...!”

“If you have business, then it’s only proper for you to come to me, right? Who would go without being told to come?”

“You, you, you...”

“Aren’t you a remnant of the old nobility? Then first you should say, ‘I have this and that business, so could you please come at this time and place?’ and only after getting a response can a promise be made, right? That’s how nobles do things, right? Yet you don’t even ask. You don’t wait for a response. You call me! And then you make a fuss when I don’t come! Do you even know how to make a promise?”

“You, you, you! Do you even understand your position?!!!”

“Ha? Position? I’m the same as you, right? Just another first-year student.”

<b>

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is Arvin, that Arvin, actually speaking some sense?!

What happened to Arvin?! What’s going on?! Did he eat something weird?!!

The other party looks like they’re about to blow smoke out of their head! No, have they already lost it?!

There’s never been a case where the world became happy from speaking sense, you know?!

Who taught him such high-level tactics of throwing out logic to provoke a fight?!!

Ah, it must be Bibi.

<b>

And the one whose head is steaming is the second son of the old baron Niven family from Group 2. That little brat!

The second son is accompanied by two male students who seem to be his followers, but while they’re making a racket along with him, they haven’t laid a hand on Arvin.

<b>

The large dining table where we are currently seated can accommodate 16 people, with 8 seats on each side. It’s made from a thick single slab of walnut, and its dark brown color is a piece of art.

I’m sitting almost in the middle, with Mia to my left, and further beside her is Bibi. By the way, Karen is sitting to my right. And across from Bibi is Lombard, with Arvin sitting at the very end of this table.

Surely, the reason the followers aren’t laying a hand on Arvin is that Lombard is sitting on the opposite side of Arvin, whom the second son is trying to grab.

Lombard exudes pressure just by sitting there!

<b>

Oh? Upon closer inspection, Miss Ruili is also quite nearby, watching this commotion with her arms crossed.

She has a stern expression on her face, but even Miss Ruili seems to refrain from confronting Arvin...

<b>

Looking at Karen to my right, she still seems anxious, so I smiled at her to reassure her, but the response I got back was a weak smile.

For now, if the second son tries to mess with Karen in front of me, I’ll send him flying.

<b>

That said, I can tell his blood is boiling, but does he really not realize the difference in strength between him and Arvin?

He seems to want to grab Arvin’s shirt and shake him, but Arvin’s body isn’t moving at all.

Rather, every time he moves his arms, he’s the one who’s shaking.

Arvin looks relatively slim, so is he underestimating him based on appearance?

If he had a body like Lombard next to him, maybe it wouldn’t have turned out this way.

<b>

“Stop whining and stand up, you bastard! You keep dodging and playing around! Today, I’ll make you realize the difference in strength between us!!”

<b>

Ah, I guess this isn’t going to end well; his head is too unfortunate.

<b>

So, how long does Arvin plan to keep this farce going?

I just want to enjoy my lunch in peace.

Listening to such unpleasant voices during meal time is bound to build up some frustration.

The deliciousness of the roast beef is already halved!

<b>

“You’re probably scared of me and sneaking around, but today, I won’t let you escape! I’ll beat you here and show you who’s on top!!”

“Ahh—no, it’s fine, you win, I lose, yep. I concede—sorry for messing with you—”

“Y-you!!! Don’t mess with me! Hey!!!”

“Look, I said I was sorry. I’m sorry for teasing you.”

“Y-you’re definitely teasing me! You bastard!!!”

<b>

Ugh, this is bad.

Hey, Arvin! I want this to end quickly!

What are you doing pouring oil on the fire?! You know it’s going to become a hassle. Seriously! 

Of all times, during meal time! I can’t believe you’re causing a ruckus at this table! I want to tell you to read the room a bit!!

I repeat, I want to enjoy my lunch slowly!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

...Huh? It seems like Mia sitting next to me, and Bibi across from me, as well as Carla, are all looking at me... what’s up?

Ah, I unconsciously started tapping my fingers on the table. Using three fingers, tap-tap-tap, like that... is that why?

Not good, that’s a rather unladylike and rude act.

Oh, Lombard and Arvin are looking this way too.

Ahem, cough. I stopped tapping my fingers and brought my hands to my mouth, lightly and cutely clearing my throat... Is that no good?

<b>

...Ah, Carla sitting across from me offered me her dessert, a pear custard tart, saying, “Want to eat?” Huh? Is it okay?

<b>

“Ah, ah, sorry! Since it’s here, why don’t we change locations? If you want, we can go behind the school building where you like. Let’s go there! Over there!”

“Y-you! Are you still trying to tease me?! You’re planning to sneak away again, aren’t you?! Damn it!!!”

“I’m not escaping! I’ll properly deal with you! So let’s just get out of here for now?! Okay?”

“Y-you...! I know you’re just going to sneak away again! That’s not happening!!”

“Because I’m not escaping! You really don’t listen to what people say, do you?!”

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Hey! You guys! Are you causing a ruckus here again?!”

“...Geh”

“Tch!!”

“To cause such a commotion again within a week! You guys are... utterly inexcusable!”

“No, no! Senpai, I was just about to do something about it...”

“Don’t make excuses! Haggard!! And Colin! You too! There’s a commotion happening right in front of you! As student council members, don’t you think you should try to settle it?!”

“Sorry, Fritz. Yes, you’re right. It’s the duty of seniors to admonish their unruly juniors.”

“...Do you really think that?”

“I do think so... But you see? Look at these energetic boys. It’s a bit too much for a weak girl like me to handle alone, don’t you think?”

“...”

“So, Fritz, I’m really glad you came. Please take care of this, Fritz.”

“...You are something else.”

<b>

Given how noisy it’s been, it’s no surprise that we’re drawing attention. The tall seniors with stern expressions have come over to our table.

Are these seniors Colin’s colleagues? They must be fellow student council members, right? The shiny, thin glasses give off a vibe of “strict senior”!

But, is it just me, or do they seem to exude a sense of being a hard worker?

The senior called Fritz seems to be questioning Colin about why he isn’t admonishing this ruckus...

But I know! Colin... no, not just Colin, but Carla, Alicia, and all the older girls here are enjoying this exchange!

They’re watching with glee to see how Arvin will respond!

Colin says it’s too much for him, but hardly anyone at this table believes that!

Furthermore, Fritz and Colin are sparkling their glasses at each other! It looks like they’re engaging in some kind of magical duel with their glasses!

<b>

“Damn it, damn it!! Everyone’s messing around! They’re making a fool of me!! They’re underestimating me!! How dare I... how dare I!! Hey!! Haggard!!”

“Oh? What’s this? Are you finally thinking of moving from here?”

“Haggard!! I challenge you to a duel!! With this, we can... we can make a promise, right?!”

“Huh?! What are you suddenly talking about?!”

“Oh really?”

“What?! What nonsense are you spouting?!”

“It’s a real one-on-one between you and me! Don’t run away, Haggard!!”

“Wait a minute, Rayleigh!! What are you saying?!”

<b>

It seems the Niven family’s brat has started saying something dangerous. “Duel”? Even Miss Ruili looks surprised.

Is there even such a thing as a “duel” these days? Especially within the academy? Is it allowed between students?

A duel is just a leftover from the era of the nobility, right?

To bring that up now is incredibly anachronistic.

<b>

<b>

“Fritz, isn’t this a place where we respect the autonomy of these children?”

“To make such a commotion to this extent, what leisurely thing are you saying! Hey! Haggard! You’re not seriously planning to accept a duel, are you?!”

“No, I have no intention of doing that at all...”

“Y-you! Are you still trying to escape at this point?! You coward!!!”

“Hey, Arvin. You’re getting such a passionate appeal. Why don’t you at least give him some attention?”

“Huh? What are you saying, even Carla?!”

“Edgarla-senpai! Please stop with the strange provocation!”

“Oops, sorry about that?”

<b>

Jessica, sitting next to Carla, leaned a bit forward and told me that “to have a ‘duel,’ you need the academy’s permission,” so it’s not something that can be done easily.

Apparently, both parties need to agree, submit an application, and only after it’s accepted and approved by the student council can it be carried out... such procedures are necessary.

It sounds like a bureaucratic process, and it seems tedious. Even if your blood is boiling, you might cool down while writing the application. That might actually be part of the intention.

<b>

“Ha! I heard your clan is known as a professional group for beast extermination?! Exterminating beasts is just pest control! You might act tough against beasts, but you’re probably scared stiff against humans, huh?!”

“What did you say?”

“Hey! Niven! You better cut it out!”

“Just a pest exterminator! I’ll make you regret defying me! I’ll teach you your place!!”

<b>

To duel, both parties must agree, so Arvin must say he’ll “accept” it.

But Arvin hasn’t said he’ll accept at all.

So this second son is desperately trying to provoke Arvin into accepting the duel.

<b>

That said, “pest extermination,” huh...

In a land without magical beasts, this is probably how the Amukam Protective Corps is evaluated, after all.

Well, there’s nothing that can be done about that. It’s impossible to understand something that doesn’t exist, and if they’re not even trying to understand, it’s even more so.

It’s bothersome to explain it carefully to such people. It’s just a waste of time.

So among the Amukam people, there’s no one who can be swayed by such trivial provocations. This is hardly even a provocation.

If Arvin gets heated over such a trivial taunt, then a little punishment will be necessary later.

If Arvin gets fired up over this level of provocation, I’ll knock him out without mercy!

<b>

“Hmm? What’s wrong, Haggard?”

“Ah, n-no, just a bit of a chill...”

<b>

“Rayleigh! Enough already...”

<b>

As Miss Ruili approached the second son, she stopped when she turned her gaze toward our table.

<b>

“Karen? ...What are you doing here? Why are you at this table?”

“...!!”

<b>

Damn! I was adjusting my position to keep Karen out of the second son’s line of sight, but it seems Miss Ruili caught her perfectly in view. I messed up!!

<b>

“Karen? Karen, you say?!”

“It’s all your fault... because of you!!”

<b>

“Karen! Y-you’re sneaking away from me too, you bastard! Don’t mess with me, you bastard!!”

<b>

The loud voice raised by the second son made Karen’s body jump in surprise.

<b>

In the next moment, a sound like a hammer striking the thick wooden table echoed loudly around, like a sharp, hard sound hitting the hard core of the wood.

That sound spread throughout the corners of the dining hall, and then the hall fell silent as if water had been poured over it.

The reverberation of the sound slowly permeated the space with its high ceiling.

<b>

<b>

In the now quiet space, I remained seated, resting my right hand, from the elbow down, on the table, directing my gaze toward the ruffians who had been making a fuss.

The three fingers of my right hand resting on the table seemed to fit oddly well, but it was probably just my imagination.

The older girls sitting across from me had their eyes wide open, and it seemed they were staring at the part of the table where my fingers were placed, but that too was probably just my imagination.

<b>

I ignored such trivial matters and called out to the ruffians I was looking at.

<b>

“Arvin, I think it’s about time to settle this ruckus, don’t you think?”

<b>

I quietly smiled, making sure not to lose my expression. It was an archaic smile.

Arvin turned his face toward me and nodded silently.

<b>

<b>

“...W-what the?! Who the hell are you?! Why are you butting in from the side?!!”

<b>

He seemed to have been dazed for a moment, but the second son quickly realized and raised his voice toward me.

At that moment, his two followers and Miss Ruili hurriedly approached and whispered something in his ear. Miss Ruili’s gaze toward me was fierce.

As they whispered around him, the second son muttered, “Huh? Amukam? This guy?” and grumbled something, but I didn’t mind.

<b>

He continued to direct his rude gaze toward me, so I tilted my head slightly while saying, “Please be gentle.”

<b>

“Ha! W-what? Are you saying you’re the head of the pest exterminators?! Hiding out with Karen like that! Is it any wonder Haggard is running away?! Haha!”

“...”

“W-what?! I’m saying Haggard is sneaking around, so it’s not worth talking about!! Huh?! What are you going to do about it?! You’re the head of this guy, right?!!”

<b>

The second son began to get worked up, directing his anger toward me.

He seemed like he was about to come over, but Lombard slightly moved his body and blocked his path, preventing him from moving. Nice one, Lombard!

<b>

I lowered my right hand from the table and placed it over Karen’s hand, gently applying pressure while keeping my gaze fixed on the second son.

<b>

“Ha! If you want, you can take Haggard’s place and face me instead! Huh? Hey!”

<b>

Oh, really... is that so?

<b>

“...So, that means you’re designating me as your opponent for the duel, right?”

<b>

In that moment, the air at our table stirred greatly.

Everyone seemed to have their eyes wide open.

Carla’s eyes seemed to ask, “Are you serious?” I heard someone swallow. “Surely... that’s...?” “Worse than minced meat...?” “Disinfection is necessary, right?” I thought I heard, but I didn’t care.

<b>

Ignoring the atmosphere around me, I looked at Arvin again and tilted my head slightly.

<b>

“This duel, I, Arvin Haggard, the third son of the old baron family, humbly accept.”

<b>

Arvin received my gaze straight on, then stood right in front of the second son, placing his right hand on his chest like a knight, and declared loudly that he would accept the duel.
