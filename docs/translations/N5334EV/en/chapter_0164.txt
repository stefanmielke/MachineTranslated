# 152 The Price of Red

The red glow jumps around like a cross, like a dancing ribbon.

Both the monsters and the men were simply at the mercy of the dancer in the red shoes.

<blank>

Haha." Ha ha ha ha ............"

<blank>

Karen laughs and kicks Parker and Fluke in the face.

The two men were dancing and one-sidedly tortured by the petite girl.

<blank>

The men's bodies had changed a lot since the beginning.

Pieces of discarded ampoules are scattered all around the alley.

Every time they were kicked to the curb, the men would drink up the pills. Of course, the men themselves had no idea how much they had taken.

But already the men's bodies were being repaired in a small amount of time without having to drink all the ampoules.

<blank>

Their physical appearance is also changing dramatically.

The muscles are bloated and thick blood vessels are visible all over the body. His skin is reddish-black, and his eyes are bloodshot and unfocused.

<blank>

When he swings his arm, it rips through the air, and when his fist hits the cobblestones, it shatters them into tiny pieces.

<blank>

GROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Gaaaadeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!"

<blank>

They could no longer even speak human language properly.

But still the hand does not reach Karen.

Dancing Karen continues to lay waste to them.

<blank>

<blank>

She looks as if she's having a good time with her cheeks uplifted.

It was like dancing, Cordilia thought as she watched.

If a canine magical beast approaches, a heavy blow is kicked into its jaws and head, without a trace of penetration.

When it sprinkled blood and hit the ground, Karen laughed even more happily.

<blank>

They dance with a carefree smile, as if they have regained their original brightness, as if in reaction to the depression they had been feeling.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Karen's kick shatters Parker's knee.

Karen's knee wrapped around his neck as he lost his balance and leaned forward.

He spun his body as if he were spinning on the spot, and the loud crack snapped Parker's neck! Parker's neck snaps with a loud "crack!

Karen dances around like a prima ballerina on a hoodie that is spewing blood and thrashing about.

<blank>

Ugh." Ha ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

<blank>

With each rise, the men's strength increases.

But Karen's power was always greater than that.

Intense and caustic, the red light-scattering shoes dance.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In her daze, Cordilia can barely follow Karen's movements with her eyes.

Still, from time to time, I can clearly see the expression on their faces.

The expression on Karen's face, smiling in a very joyful way and her cheeks stained with ecstasy.

<blank>

Every time the red shoe lays waste to an opponent, his face is stained with glee.

She is so beautiful that it is hard to believe she is a little girl, and she has a glamorous expression.

<blank>

That scared Cordelia.

I felt as if Karen was being painted over by something else.

<blank>

"............ no. Karen, ...... no."

<blank>

I don't know what makes me think that.

However, Cordelia feels a strong feeling rising from deep within her that she cannot go on like this.

<blank>

That's Karen, but it's not Karen.

For a moment now, I can finally feel as close as I used to, but if I don't, Karen will go away again.

If that happens, I am sure Karen will never come back.

Something will cover it up and paint it over, and it will become something different from Karen.

<blank>

Such thoughts swell up in Cordelia's chest.

It suddenly overflowed and spilled from her small chest, and a sense of uncontrollable frustration grew within Cordelia.

Rolling her body, which was not moving properly, Cordelia reached out her hand toward Karen. Then, with all the strength she could muster, she squeezed her voice as hard as she could.

<blank>

Kaleen! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

His voice was never strong or loud.

Even so, his voice resonates as he exerts his remaining strength. His voice, filled with his feelings, reaches her.

<blank>

?

<blank>

For that brief moment, Karen's movement stops with a snap.

<blank>

Cody?" ...... What? What?"

<blank>

Karen looked up with a start, as if she had been sleeping slightly when she was suddenly shaken awake.

The ecstatic expression that had been on her face disappeared, revealing the face of a bewildered girl of appropriate age.

<blank>

"......Why ......What?"

<blank>

A dog demon beast, which stood up, jumped on the Karen.

Karen quickly dodged, but her movements were not as sharp as before.

Before I knew it, the red light that had flooded my feet had disappeared.

I feel dizzy, as if the blood is draining from my head. My body feels very heavy.

<blank>

Damn!

<blank>

The hexenbiest, which had avoided it, jumped at Karen again.

Karen brushes it off and slams a roundhouse kick into the side of the hexenbiest's head. However, although the hexenbiest was blown away, this time its head was not split open.

The magical beast shakes its head at the point where it was played, then snarls low, looking for an opportunity to pounce once more.

<blank>

Karen's foot, which was trying to position itself against the magical beast, was suddenly caught by something and stopped.

Looking at his motionless feet, he sees that someone is holding his ankles.

<blank>

"Zu dima dima dima dima ......, gadeen."

Parker?" ...... ah?!"

<blank>

There he was, Parker, who had just been struck down.

Parker grabs Karen's right ankle as she falls and moves her neck, which is bent at an impossible angle, and the corners of her mouth turn up as her face contorts into a fearless shape.

<blank>

Parker stands up as if nothing happened, still holding Karen's ankle.

Karen falls down on her face as she is stood up with her ankles waiting.

As he stood, Parker shook his body, gurgled his neck loudly, and then put it back together.

<blank>

"I can't go to ...... any more. Gee hee hee hee hee."

Augh." Ha, let go of me, Parker. ...... Let go of me!"

<blank>

Karen kicked Parker in the wrist with her remaining left leg while holding her right leg.

Karen's heel crushed the base of Parker's thumb. The thumb was dislodged, but Karen's body was about to be lifted upside down, held in place by the remaining four fingers.

<blank>

Let go of me! I said!

<blank>

Karen used her hands on the cobblestones to raise her body in a bouncing motion, then swung her body with Parker's hand and turned it outward in a twisting motion.

Parker's wrist was gurgled loudly and unarticulated, but his fingers still held Karen's ankle.

<blank>

Vzuzeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

?

<blank>

With his wrists unhinged, Parker swung his arm and slammed Karen to the cobblestones.

Parker's wrist swung upward, causing Karen to slam into the cobblestone from behind.

<blank>

AUGHGHHHH!!!!"

<blank>

The impact of the slam hit his whole body.

Instantly, my vision burst into white, I lost all sense of up and down, and my consciousness flew away.

The air in my lungs is knocked out and I can't breathe.

But it helped that shortly thereafter, his lungs coughed for air and he regained his skipped consciousness.

He must have barely been able to catch himself, but the bones in his arms where he hit the cobblestones were in pretty bad shape.

<blank>

'...... ah, ah! Geehaw! Geehaw!"

<blank>

The body does not move properly.

More than the damage done by the beating, my whole body is tormented by a terrible laziness.

I was trying desperately to hold on to my consciousness, as if I would jump out of my skin if I let up.

<blank>

Looking down at the slow-moving Karen, Parker begins to laugh, his mouth twisted into a disgusted gibberish.

<blank>

"Gee ha ha ha ha! Oh, woe is me, ode no ougi ni zaze de e mooru goo."

Ugh. ......

<blank>

Karen tries to crawl away from Parker's hand, keeping her body on the cobblestone, but Parker's hand won't let her.

<blank>

"Do you want to go out? Gareen nn? Nbahahahaha!

Aww!"

<blank>

Parker's hand pulls back Karen's slightly advanced body. Then he starts to laugh out loud again, gibbering.

<blank>

"What? What the hell is wrong with you? No, I'm going to get you in a big fat hurry! Gee wha wha wha wha!

No, don't! Cody! Run, Cody!

<blank>

Parker holds Karen's ankle and turns toward Cordelia and the others.

Karen's voice is strained to tell him to run away, but Cordelia is already unconscious.

He repeatedly kicked Parker's finger with his left leg, but the forceless kick did no damage at all.

I clawed at the cobblestones as I was dragged along, trying to stop myself from going any further, but there was no resistance, and only my fingernails peeled off.

<blank>

"...... Cody ...... ugh! Cody!!!!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Don't get hit! Karen Marlin!"

<blank>

Suddenly, someone threw a sharp voice at Karen.

<blank>

Karen didn't know what she was talking about, but she was dragged along and quickly held her head protectively and curled up as best she could.

<blank>

A moment later, a shock ripped through the atmosphere.

It went straight for Parker as if sucking him in and severed his arm from the elbow.
