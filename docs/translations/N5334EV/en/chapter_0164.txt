# Episode 152: The Price of Red

As if crossing each other, ribbons dance, and red light bounces around.

Both the magical beasts and the men were merely toyed with by the dancer in the red shoes.

<b>

"Ah ha! Ah ha ha ha ha..."

<b>

Karen laughs as she kicks up the parka and Fluke.

The two men were being toyed with by her small frame, subjected to one-sided torment.

<b>

The men's bodies had changed significantly compared to how they were at the beginning.

The alley was littered with fragments of discarded ampoules.

Every time they were kicked away, the men had been downing that drug. They had no idea how much they had consumed.

However, their bodies had already reached a point where they could recover with just a little time, even without drinking the ampoules.

<b>

Their physiques were also changing greatly.

Muscles were bulging, and thick veins were visible all over their bodies. Their skin had turned a dark red, and their bloodshot eyes, unable to focus, seemed utterly unfocused.

<b>

When they swung their arms, they tore through the air, and when their fists struck the cobblestones, they shattered them to pieces.

<b>

"GROOOOAAAAAARRR!!!"

"GAADDEEEENNNN!!!"

<b>

They could no longer even speak coherently.

Yet, even so, their hands could not reach Karen.

Dancing, Karen continued to trample over them.

<b>

<b>

Her cheeks flushed, she looked as if she couldn't help but enjoy herself.

Cordelia, watching, thought it was as if she were dancing.

As a dog-like magical beast approached, a heavy strike was delivered to its jaw and head without hesitation.

Even as blood splattered and it writhed in pain, Karen let out an even more joyful laugh.

<b>

As if she had regained her original brightness, which had been suppressed until now, she danced with an untroubled smile.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Karen's kick shattered the parka's knee.

As it lost balance and tilted, Karen's knee wrapped around its neck.

Spinning her body on the spot, a loud crack echoed as the parka's neck was broken.

On top of the parka, which was spewing blood and writhing in agony, Karen danced like a prima ballerina.

<b>

"Ufufu! Ah ha! Ah ha ha ha ha ha!"

<b>

With each time they stood up, the men's strength increased.

However, Karen's power always surpassed theirs.

Fiercely and intensely, her red-light-emitting shoes danced.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Cordelia, in a daze, could barely keep up with Karen's movements.

Even so, occasionally, she clearly saw the expression on her face.

Karen's face, floating with a joyful smile, was flushed with ecstasy.

<b>

Each time the red shoes trampled over their opponents, her face was dyed with delight.

It was so beautiful that it made her heart skip a beat, showing a sensual expression that was hard to believe belonged to a girl.

<b>

That scared Cordelia.

It felt as if Karen was being covered and painted over by something else.

<b>

"……No. Karen... No."

<b>

She didn't know what made her feel that way.

However, Cordelia felt a strong urge rising from deep within her that this couldn't continue.

<b>

That was Karen, but it wasn't Karen.

For a moment, she felt as if she could finally feel her close again, but if this continued, Karen would surely disappear somewhere again.

If that happened, Karen would never come back.

Covered and painted over by something, she would become something different from Karen.

<b>

Such thoughts swelled within Cordelia's heart.

They quickly overflowed from her small chest, and an uncontrollable sense of urgency grew within her.

Rolling her barely moving body, Cordelia reached out her hand toward Karen. And with all her remaining strength, she squeezed out her voice.

<b>

"KAREEEN! NOOOOOO!"

<b>

That voice was neither strong nor loud.

Even so, that voice, strained with her remaining strength, resonated. The feelings carried by that voice reached her.

<b>

"?!"

<b>

In that instant, Karen's movements came to a sudden halt.

<b>

"Cordelia? ...Eh? What?"

<b>

As if suddenly jolted awake from a slumber, Karen looked up with a start.

The ecstatic expression that had been there vanished, revealing the face of a girl who was bewildered for her age.

<b>

"…Why... eh?"

<b>

At that moment, a standing dog-like magical beast lunged at Karen.

Karen instinctively dodged, but her movements lacked the sharpness they had before.

The red light that had been overflowing from her feet had disappeared without her noticing.

She felt a dizziness as if the blood had drained from her head. Her body felt extremely heavy.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

The dodged magical beast lunged at Karen again.

Karen evaded it and delivered a roundhouse kick to the beast's temple. However, although the beast was knocked back, this time its head did not split open.

After shaking its head where it had been knocked, the beast let out a low growl, looking for another opportunity to pounce.

<b>

As Karen tried to regain her stance against the beast, her foot suddenly got caught on something and stopped.

Looking down at her immobile feet, she saw someone gripping her ankle.

<b>

"Zugamae... da, gadeen."

"Parka? ...Ugh?!"

<b>

There was the parka she had just defeated.

Still on the ground, the parka gripped Karen's right ankle, twisting its neck at an impossible angle, distorting its face into a horrific grin.

<b>

Still holding Karen's ankle, the parka stood up as if nothing had happened.

Because her ankle was held, Karen was forced to fall face down.

While standing, the parka swayed its body, cracking its neck loudly, returning it to its original shape.

<b>

"Mo... nigazanee. Gehehhehe."

"Ugh! Let go of me, Parka... Let me go!"

<b>

While her right foot was held, Karen kicked at the parka's wrist with her remaining left leg.

Karen's heel crushed the base of the parka's thumb. Although the thumb was dislocated, the remaining four fingers still held her ankle, and Karen's body was being lifted upside down.

<b>

"LET GO! I TOLD YOU TO LET GO!!"

<b>

Using both hands that touched the cobblestones, Karen pushed herself up, shaking her body to break free from the parka's grip and twisting it outward.

With a loud crack, the parka's wrist was dislocated, but its fingers still held onto Karen's ankle.

<b>

"UZZZEEEEEEE!!!"

"?!"

<b>

With its wrist still dislocated, the parka swung its arm around and slammed Karen onto the cobblestones.

As the parka's wrist was facing up while being swung, Karen was slammed onto the ground on her back.

<b>

"AAAGGGHHH!!!"

<b>

The impact of being slammed hit her entire body.

In an instant, her vision burst white, and she lost her sense of up and down, her consciousness fading away.

Air was expelled from her lungs, and she couldn't breathe.

However, immediately after, her lungs gasped for air, and the returning consciousness was a relief.

She barely managed to take a fall, but the bones in her arms that hit the cobblestones were in a rather bad state.

<b>

"…Ah, ugh! Cough! Cough!"

<b>

Her body couldn't move properly.

More than the damage from being slammed, her whole body was tormented by a terrible fatigue.

If she relaxed even a little, her consciousness felt like it would slip away, and she desperately held on.

<b>

Looking down at the sluggishly moving Karen, the parka twisted its mouth into a sneer and began to laugh obnoxiously.

<b>

"Geha geha ha ha! Ovaehah, mou, ode no, ugin ni, zazedemoraugo!"

"Ugh, ...kuh."

<b>

Karen tried to escape from the parka's grip, moving as if crawling while still on the cobblestones, but the parka's hand wouldn't allow it.

<b>

"Doogoni, ikugidaa? Gareeen?! Nbahahaha!"

"Ugh!"

<b>

The parka's hand pulled Karen's body back slightly. Then it laughed loudly again.

<b>

"What is it? Where are you going? No, I'm going to do it! Gehyahyah!"

"Stop it! Cordy! Run away, Cordy!!"

<b>

Still holding Karen's ankle, the parka turned to face Cordelia and the others.

Karen strained her voice to tell Cordelia to run, but Cordelia was already unconscious.

Kicking at the parka's fingers with her left leg repeatedly, but the weak kicks did no damage at all.

Trying to stop herself from being dragged away, she clawed at the cobblestones, but it was no resistance at all, and many of her nails were ripped off.

<b>

"…Cordy... ugh! Cordy!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Don't hit her! Karen Merlin!"

<b>

Suddenly, someone shouted sharply at Karen.

<b>

She didn't know what it was about, but even while being dragged, Karen instinctively covered her head and curled her body as much as she could.

<b>

In an instant, a shockwave tore through the air.

It shot straight toward the parka, severing its arm at the elbow.
