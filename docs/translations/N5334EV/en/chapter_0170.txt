# Episode 158: Invitation from Annie

On that day, Annie was walking through a corridor that was not familiar to her usual elementary school surroundings, with a slightly nervous expression.

<b>

Even though it was the same school, it was rare for a young child like Annie to come to this place where secondary education was taking place.

When she entered after obtaining permission from the security guard at the entrance of the secondary building, she was offered to be accompanied, but Annie politely declined the offer.

She believed that there was meaning in accomplishing her goal by herself.

<b>

Since today was a weekend that ended in the morning, at this time, those people should be gathered at their intended place.

While being aware that she was being watched by the older students, Annie walked straight ahead.

<b>

<b>

Before long, she arrived at the secondary cafeteria, which was overflowing with students beyond her imagination.

――I must find Sister Sue somewhere in this crowd――

However, despite her determination to step inside, she felt intimidated by the sheer number of people.

<b>

She thought it might be safer to ask someone, but most of the students were too engrossed in satisfying their appetites to notice Annie, who was out of their line of sight.

<b>

It might be more reliable to check the tables one by one.

As she sighed softly and was about to take a step forward, someone called out to her.

<b>

“Oh? Are you perhaps from Amukamu?”

<b>

The one who spoke was a tall, slender girl with long blue hair.

At first, she looked down at Annie, but soon bent down to be at the same eye level and continued speaking.

<b>

“Indeed, you are the daughter of the Consul General of Amukamu, right? Don’t you remember? I was introduced to you by Senior Colin at the consulate party, and I’m Selkie Mau from Oceanos.”

<b>

“Oh!” Annie exclaimed.

That’s right. She was the person introduced to her by Sister Colin as someone from the ocean people of Oceanos.

Annie recognized the beautiful blue hair and translucent white skin.

<b>

“I remember you, Senior Selkie Mau. It’s been a long time.”

“Ehehe, I’m glad you remember me. So, what brings you to a cafeteria full of upperclassmen?”

“Um, actually…”

“Ehehe, it’s okay, I understand.”

“Huh?”

“The fact that an elementary student like you is here means you must have business with your cousin, right?”

“Yes! Actually, that’s it! But I don’t know where she is…”

“I thought so. I believe the Cloud family is at that table over there. Let me guide you. Let’s go together.”

“Ah, yes! Thank you very much!”

<b>

Annie happily took Selkie Mau’s outstretched hand, and the two of them proceeded deeper into the bustling cafeteria.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Annie! What’s wrong?”

“Ehehe, you were looking for your cousin at the entrance of the cafeteria and seemed lost.”

“Oh my! Selkie brought you here, didn’t she? Thank you very much!”

“No, I also know the person you’re looking for…”

“Right? Thank you, Senior Selkie!”

<b>

Annie and Selkie were laughing together, saying “Hey?” and “Ehehe.”

Hmm, what an unexpected friendship.

Should I say that Annie is indeed the daughter of Uncle Philip, the Consul General?

Or should I say that Selkie’s wide circle of acquaintances is impressive?

Perhaps it could be both.

<b>

Selkie waved goodbye to Annie with a smile, her blue hair swaying as she left the table.

She still has such graceful manners.

<b>

I sat Annie to my right and asked, “Have you eaten lunch?” to which she replied that she had hurriedly finished it.

<b>

“Well then, do you still want dessert? Shall we eat pudding together?”

<b>

When I asked, Annie nodded enthusiastically with a radiant smile.

She seems mature, but such reactions are adorably age-appropriate.

Before I knew it, Carla had brought fruit water and gently placed it in front of Annie, saying, “Drink up.”

Annie thanked Carla and held the glass with both hands, earnestly drinking from it, which was quite charming. It’s no wonder everyone watching her felt warm inside.

<b>

“By the way, Annie, what brings you all the way here?”

<b>

As Annie happily stuffed her cheeks with pumpkin cake, I asked again if she had any business, and she opened her eyes wide with the cake fork still in her mouth.

Annie quickly washed down the food with fruit water, covered her mouth with a napkin, then got off her chair, straightened her posture, and bowed to me.

<b>

“Today, I came to invite Sister Sue and the others.”

<b>

Saying this, Annie handed me an envelope.

<b>

“Next week, I will have my birthday party. I would be very happy if you could come.”

“Of course, Annie. I will definitely attend.”

<b>

Today is the 4th of the 5th month of the Red Moon.

I already knew that the next weekend, the 11th of the 5th month of the Red Moon, was Annie’s birthday.

<b>

However, I never expected to receive an invitation in this manner.

The way she shyly thrusts out the invitation! The cuteness of Annie in this gesture is simply irresistible!

<b>

But I also thought that if she only wanted to hand me the invitation, there was no need for her to come here today.

I had plans to stop by Uncle’s place today, and I thought she could have given it to me anytime…

<b>

As I was thinking about this while receiving the invitation, Annie trotted over to the other side of the table.

And then――.

<b>

“I also brought an invitation for Karen!”

“Eh? Annie-chan, for me too?!”

“Yes! Dan and Nan will also attend!”

“……I see.”

<b>

“And I would be very happy if Lady Cordelia could come along as well.”

“Oh my, Annie! Oh my! Oh my!! Annie!!”

<b>

I see, she wanted to hand invitations to these two as well.

Indeed, if the three of us are to gather, this timing seems to be the most certain.

<b>

Lady Cordelia was trembling with excitement, as if she were about to burst into tears, as she received the invitation with shaking hands.

<b>

“Is it really okay for me to be invited too?”

“Of course!”

<b>

She really is excited. Lady Cordelia’s eyes are watery.

Even Lady Lucille and Lady Catherine seem to be wiping their eyes? I think I heard Lady Catherine murmur, “Such a cute friend for the lonely lady…” 

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Thank you, Annie-chan, I’m so happy. But…”

<b>

On the other hand, Karen hesitated slightly, and Annie looked up at her anxiously.

<b>

“But I don’t have a dress to wear to the party anymore. It’s embarrassing, but I don’t have the means to make one…”

<b>

Karen expressed regret that she didn’t have an outfit suitable for such a big party.

<b>

“In that case! I will prepare a dress for you, Karen! If I tell my father, he will do something about it right away!”

“Cordy?! No, you can’t do that!! I can’t accept such a thing! I would feel bad for Uncle Caspar too!”

“What are you saying, Karen! If my father knows he can do something for you, he will be so happy!”

“Dan and Nan’s outfits have already been prepared.”

“Even that… Thank you, Annie-chan. I’m really grateful for how well you treat my brother and sister.”

Then, Karen continued, asking that at least the twins be allowed to enjoy themselves.

<b>

To that, both Cordelia and Annie insisted, “You don’t need to worry! I will make it for you!”

It seems that neither Lady Cordelia nor Annie has any intention of giving up on Karen.

<b>

From Karen now, I no longer sensed the initial impression of being timid and reserved.

Rather, her quiet demeanor as she declined the invitation seemed to reflect a strong will.

<b>

Is Karen quite stubborn?

<b>

Did she argue like this with Lady Cordelia in the past?

If that’s the case, I should probably intervene before it escalates too much, or it might turn into a big deal again.

<b>

Meanwhile, a shadow stood near the three of them, who were continuing their argument.

In fact, she had come to this table a little while ago, but the three of them, engrossed in their discussion, seemed unaware of her presence.

<b>

Then, she calmly spoke to the three of them.

<b>

“If that’s the case, it might be just the right timing.”

“Senior Colin!”

<b>

Colin had arrived, perhaps after finishing her student council duties.

Colin said something about it being “just right.”

<b>

“Well then, Karen Merlin. And Sue, Vivi, and Mia. Since we have guests, let’s go to the guest room together.”

““““Huh?””””

<b>

With that, she clapped her hands at her chest and, with a cheerful smile behind her large round glasses, Colin said that.
