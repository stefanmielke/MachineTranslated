# 158 Invitation from Annie

Annie was a little nervous that day as she made her way down a passageway that did not belong to the elementary school building she was accustomed to as usual.

<blank>

Even though they are in the same school, there are few young children like Annie who come to this place where secondary education is provided.

When she asked permission from the guard at the entrance to the middle school building to go inside, he suggested that she go with him, but Annie politely declined the offer.

Because Annie believed that it was meaningful to fulfill her purpose on her own.

<blank>

Today, on a weekend that ends in the morning, those people should be gathering at the desired location at this time.

Annie is aware that she is being looked away from by the older students, but she continues straight ahead.

<blank>

<blank>

The large cafeteria in the middle school building, which arrived shortly after, was filled with more students than Annie had imagined.

I have to find my sister Sue who is somewhere in all of this--I have to find my sister Sue who is somewhere in all of this--I have to find her.

However, I felt intimidated by the sheer number of people who had entered the place with no intention of leaving.

<blank>

I tried to talk to her, thinking it would be safer to ask someone first, but most of the students did not notice Annie out of their line of sight and were preoccupied with moving to satisfy their own appetites.

<blank>

It might be more reliable to look around the table from one end to the other.

With a small sigh, someone called out to Annie as she was about to step out.

<blank>

"Oh? Are you by any chance from Amcam?"

<blank>

It was a slender, tall female student with long blue hair who approached me.

At first she looked down at Annie, but soon she bent down and continued to speak when she was at the same eye level as Annie.

<blank>

I knew it. You are Consul General Amkham's daughter, aren't you? Don't you remember me? I am Selkie Mau of Oceanoos, who was invited to the Consulate's party by Mr. Colin, and I greeted her.

<blank>

Oh," Annie exclaims.

Yes, that's right. He is the one who was introduced to me by Sister Colin before as a mariner from Oceanoos.

I recognize this beautiful blue hair and clear white skin.

<blank>

I remember you, Mr. Selkie Mau. It has been a long time.

I'm so glad you remember me. So, how are you doing in a cafeteria full of upperclassmen like this?"

"...... Oh, actually, ......"

"Uh-huh. I understand.

Huh?"

You, from the elementary school, must have something to do with your cousin if you are coming to a place like this, right?"

Yes, yes, it is! Yes, I am! But I don't know where you are. ......"

I'm sure you're right. ...... I think Mr. Cloud and the others are at the table on the other side of the room. Let me show you. Let's come together.

Oh, hi! Thank you very much!"

<blank>

Annie happily took Selkie Mau's offered hand, and the two went straight to the back of the crowded dining room.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Annie! What's wrong?"

"Ummm, you were at a loss to find your cousin at the entrance of the dining room.

Oh, well! Mr. Selkie brought me all the way here, didn't he? Thank you very much."

No, I know the person you're talking about. ...... hey?"

Yes, sir! Thank you very much, Mr. Selkie!"

<blank>

Annie and Mr. Selkie say, "Hey?" They laugh at each other, "Uh-huh."

Hom, that's an unexpected friendship.

Annie is the daughter of Uncle Philip, the quintessential Consul General, I should say.

Or should I say that Mr. Selkie's wide face is quintessential.

Maybe it's both, I'm sure.

<blank>

Mr. Selkie smiled and waved to Annie as he went, shook his blue hair, and walked away from the table.

She is as beautiful in her manners as ever.

<blank>

I sat Annie down at the table right next to me and asked her if she had eaten lunch. I asked her if she had eaten lunch, to which she replied that she had finished in a hurry.

<blank>

So, are we ready for dessert yet? Shall we have pudding together?"

<blank>

Annie nodded her head broadly with a smile that seemed to spill out when I asked her that.

They seem firm and these reactions are cute and appropriate for their age.

Before I knew it, Carla had brought fruit water and gently placed it in front of Annie, saying, "Drink.

It was also adorable to see Annie, who thanked Carla and happily held the glass with both hands and drank hard. It's no wonder that everyone's eyes were so relieved to see her.

<blank>

By the way, Annie, what brings you all the way out here?

<blank>

When I asked Annie again if she had something to do, she opened her eyes with a cake fork in her mouth.

Annie immediately poured out her mouth with fruit water, covered her mouth with a napkin, got off her chair, looked at me, straightened her posture, and bowed.

<blank>

I am here to see you, my sisters.

<blank>

Annie then held out a sealed envelope to me.

<blank>

Next week, I am having a birthday party. I hope you will come.

Of course, Annie. I'll be there, I promise."

<blank>

Today is the fourth day of the fourth month of the red month of 5.

We already know that the next weekend, 5 Red Moon 11, is Annie's birthday.

<blank>

But I never thought it would be in this way that I would receive an invitation.

This gesture of holding out the invitation card while smiling! How Annie teases him! It's unbearable, isn't it?

<blank>

However, I don't think I would have had to come here now if all you had to do was to give me an invitation.

I had plans to stop by your uncle's today, and I think I could have given it to you at any time. ......

<blank>

As I was thinking about this while receiving the invitation, Annie walked to the other side of the table.

And then--.

<blank>

I have an invitation for you to come, Karen.

What? Annie, you got one for me?

Yes! Dan and Nan will be in attendance!"

"............ so."

<blank>

And I would be very happy if you would come with me, Miss Cordelia."

Well, Annie! Well! Well! Annie!

<blank>

I see, you wanted to hand the invitation to these two as well.

I am sure that this is the best time for the three of us to get together.

<blank>

Miss Cordelia received the invitation with trembling hands, as if to say she was overcome with emotion.

<blank>

Are you sure you don't mind if I join you?

Of course!"

<blank>

You're really impressed. Miss Cordelia is getting teary-eyed.

Even Mistress Lucille and Mistress Catherine are holding their eyes? I thought I heard Mistress Catherine mutter, ......, "The bossy young lady has such a lovely friend."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Thanks Annie, it's my pleasure. But ......"

<blank>

Annie, on the other hand, looks up anxiously at Karen, who is a little hesitant to say anything.

<blank>

But I don't have a dress that I can wear to a party anymore. I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I can't afford to make a dress ......"

<blank>

I don't have an outfit I can wear to such a big party, Karen says ruefully.

<blank>

I'll get you Karen's dress! I'll get you a dress, Karen! I'll tell your father and he'll take care of it right away!"

'Cody? No, you can't do that! I can't get you to go that far! And I feel bad for Uncle Casper!"

What are you talking about, Karen? Your father would be so pleased to know what I can do for you!"

We have already prepared the Dan and Nan isho for you."

Even that." ....... Thank you so much Annie. I really appreciate you treating my brother and sister so well."

And, Karen continues, at least let the twins have some fun.

<blank>

To Karen, he said, "I'm afraid I don't have your confidence! I will tailor it for you!" The two of them were determined to make the best of the situation.

Apparently, neither Miss Cordelia nor Annie have any intention of giving up on Karen.

<blank>

I get no sense from Karen now of the timid and withdrawn impression I first got from her.

Rather, his quiet, troubled refusal of the invitation is that of a person with a firm will.

<blank>

I mean, is Karen a stubborn girl?

<blank>

Did you have arguments like this with Miss Cordilia in the past?

If so, we need to stop him at a good point, or he might get too heated up and get into trouble again.

<blank>

And there is one figure standing beside the three who continue to argue with each other.

Actually, they had been at this table for a little while, but the three of us, engrossed in our argument, didn't seem to notice.

<blank>

Then, slowly, she approached the three of them.

<blank>

If that's what you mean, then maybe it was just as well."

Sister Colin!"

<blank>

Colin was here to see if the student council had finished their work.

What does this Colin mean, he says "just fine" or something like that.

<blank>

Okay, Karen Merlin," he said. And Sue, Bibi and Mia. Shall we go with you to the guest room?

「「「「 Yes? 」」」」

<blank>

Then he clapped his hands on his chest, smiled and squinted his tangerine eyes behind his large round glasses at us, and said, "I'm sorry, Colin.
