# 80 Guests from the Royal Capital

'How long has it been since I've seen your stern face? Reinwald Kleiner!

'That goes for both of us, Howard! You look as fierce as ever!"

<blank>

They arrived in the late afternoon and were said to be old friends of Papa Howard's who had come all the way from King's Landing.

It had been more than a decade since they had met in person.

Both of them looked very happy, tapping each other on the shoulder and rejoicing to see each other again.

<blank>

Mr. Reinwald's chiseled face is indeed as severe as Howard's, but his neatly trimmed mustache and white hair, which is slicked back in an all-back style, give him a very elegant and dignified appearance.

And his eyes, with their calm yet piercing light, remind me of a warrior who has fought many battles, just like Papa Howard.

The countless old scars on your face and hands are proof of this and the medals themselves.

<blank>

You must be Susie. I've heard a lot about you.

<blank>

After greeting Sonia and her mother, Mr. Reinwald turned to me and smiled kindly.

<blank>

Yes, I'm Susie. Pleased to meet you.

<blank>

When I also greeted the customer with a curtsey, Mr. Reinwald's eyes relaxed even more and he nodded.

Is it safe to say that it was done in the proper manner?

Elrose behind me and AnnaMarie don't look like they want to say anything, so it's okay, right?

I just can't get used to these things, and I'm always in a cold sweat. ......

But unusually, AnnaMarie is feeling nervous this time.

After all, today's client is a person of quite a high status? When I think so, I still get a little nervous. ......

<blank>

Reinwald! Smiling from above with a look like that only scares the hell out of them, don't you think? Sorry little lady, no offense to this man. I'll take care of you for a short time. I've known your father for a long time, and I'd be glad to have your company at ease."

<blank>

Pushing Mr. Reinwald aside, another customer spoke to us in a slightly playful, lighthearted manner.

I was a little nervous, but his smile was so warm that it seemed to relieve my nervousness.

<blank>

The man who introduced himself as "Arthur" was smaller than Papa Howard, but I guessed he was about 180 cm tall. He was smaller than Howard's father, but I guessed that he was about 180 cm tall.

She was in her mid-fifties. Her softly wavy flaxen hair and steeple-colored eyes filled with gentle light seemed to express her warm personality.

<blank>

Howard Papa and Sonia Mama told me only that the two guests were 'old friends,' but they did not tell me in what capacity they were.

Even so, their behavior was so refined that it was easy to imagine that they must be people who hold important positions in the central (royal) capital.

The atmosphere of the room is not at all inferior to that of the former high-ranking nobles who are welcomed at the Harvest Festival.

So, I was nervous that I could not be rude!　I was so nervous. As if anticipating my nervousness, Arthur-san gave me a kind smile.

From such a point of view, Arthur's nostalgia and kindness become slightly apparent.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Arthur and his family spend a few days every few years for a summer vacation in Amcam.

He said that this was his first visit to AMCAM in four years.

Mr. Arthur, who said he had not seen me in a long time and was very much looking forward to seeing me, drove away from Papa Howard and headed for the One's stuffing room as soon as he arrived at our house and greeted me.

<blank>

Huh? Didn't you prepare the tea? and Elrose, looking back at Mama Sonia, cowering her shoulders and shaking her head, smiling dismissively.

<blank>

Shall we start preparing dinner for now?"

<blank>

After saying this, Mama Sonia heads for the kitchen of the house.

<blank>

Since we have received a whole boa that is ready to eat, let's prepare a full course with it and surprise everyone! Hmph."

<blank>

Sonia Mama said so and happily started preparing the boa meat.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And with plenty of time and effort, Mama Sonia, with the help of Elrose and myself (of course, AnnaMarie put all her energy into serving the food ......), made the dinner.

The amacamboa full course that day was very well received by the guests.

<blank>

Arthur and Reinwald enjoyed not only Mom's specialty Amkam dishes, such as stewed Amkam boa tongue and stewed feet, but also my pancakes made from this year's harvest of potatoes.

He was looking forward to having Amkam's specialties like this here. It was a great pleasure for me to have such a specialty of Amkam.

<blank>

Both Howard Papa and Sonia Mama looked very happy at the table, which was livelier than usual.

I think this may be the first time I've ever seen Howard Papa smile with such boyish glee.

Seeing my dad like that, I end up enjoying myself as well. I am sure the same is true for Mom Sonia. When our eyes meet, we see each other's mouths are parted, and we can't help but laugh even more.

<blank>

After dinner, the men continued to savor their good times with a few drinks, while Mama Sonia and I enjoyed the tea that AnnaMarie had brewed for us.

It would eventually come to a quiet end with the arrival of Mr. Jacob, the chief butler from the Amcam House.

They seem to be special guests and are staying in the best guest room at the Amcam House.

Mr. Jacob came to pick them up in his carriage.

<blank>

Arthur and his family really wanted to stay at our house, but it didn't seem to work out that way.

Mr. Reinwald and Papa Howard promised to meet at the Amcam House forge in the early morning, and left our house with regretful farewells.

Tomorrow, Papa Howard said happily, I will show you both around the village.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

But somehow, the next day, it became my job to accompany Mr. Arthur.

Mr. Reinwald, who came with us (probably as an escort ......), has been sweating it out with Papa Howard at the Amakam House training facility all morning .......

<blank>

"I was wondering if you would be willing to take your father's place and show me around."

<blank>

Mr. Arthur, who was brought to the Cloud house in a horse-drawn carriage by Jacob, the chief butler, said with a laugh.

In fact, Howard's father was supposed to be their host during their stay, but Arthur said that he wanted them to cherish their friendship with an old friend they had not seen in decades.

Sonia-mama also laughed, as if she was troubled, and said she would ask me for a favor.

<blank>

Well, for my part, if I can make Howard Dad look so happy, I would be happy to give him a tour!

Besides, I am a little proud to think that this is also the role of a daughter of the Cloud family!

<blank>

I understand. Leave it to me!"

<blank>

I tapped my chest and accepted the unexpected role.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

First, Arthur wanted to see the Amkam harvest, so we decided to go around the farms from one end to the other.

<blank>

Even with this, Amkam is a village with abundant crops.

The wheat fields seem to go on forever, of course, and there are plenty of high-quality crops to be had.

<blank>

Amcam's corn is large-grained and very sweet.

Freshly harvested early in the morning is just like a sweet treat.

When the man in the field here sees me on my morning run, he often tosses me a freshly picked piece of rice as a greeting.

I told you how sweet it was then!

It's a little bit embarrassing to eat while running, but it's no use, my cheeks are about to melt!

<blank>

And then there are the Amkam potatoes! When steamed, they are rich in starch, so they make things very dusty!

The pancakes and galette I made last night were also made with these potatoes.

By doing so, they can be very tasty.

<blank>

There are also so many berries.

The bright red strawberries are large and the flesh is very sweet.

Even the raspberries are big and sweet, and if you eat them with gusto, your mouth will turn purple in no time.

<blank>

Arthur was very pleased with the freshly picked boiled corn, steamed potatoes, and freshly picked berries, all of which were delicious and tasty in his mouth.

<blank>

I, as well as everyone who shared their crops with me, couldn't help but feel proud and happy, and my eyes relaxed with pride and joy.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The vast wheat field, one of AMCAM's prized landscapes, was almost all neatly cut after the harvesting that began last week.

Ears of wheat are piled up, and people who are working on the harvesting of wheat greet me with a smile when they notice me here and there.

<blank>

Susie, my lady!

<blank>

In the midst of all this, I heard a lovely voice calling me from behind a heap of wheat that had been cut and piled up.

<blank>

Harvesting Amkam's vast wheat crop requires a lot of manpower.

This is the only time when the entire village is involved, but even so, more hands are still needed.

At such times, the people of Glassfoot, which has a settlement west of Amkam, are reliable.

<blank>

Howard Papa has taught me that it was the power of the Glassfoot people, who are called the "people of the soil," that made this land, which was originally barren of soil, so rich.

These people are experts in dealing with crops.

The hard-working grasshoppers dexterously harvested rice one after another and piled up the ears.

<blank>

A small fluttering mass flew from one of the piles.

It's a little girl running, shaking the large folds of her big apron dress and her hair, still tied in a big ponytail.

Her hair is warm, soft camel blonde and sways well in the wind.

<blank>

The child ran up to me at once and jumped into the water as if diving.

I use the volume of my skirt to stop the dive of the six-year-old girl.

<blank>

"Miss Susie, are you going somewhere? Are you going somewhere?"

<blank>

The name of this girl who is hugging me with sparkling eyes is Angelica Gamgee.

Yes, this is our Gilbert's grandson.

She is a spirited little girl who is now bracing herself to follow in the footsteps of her grandfather, Gilberto, and be my companion in the future! She is an energetic little girl who is now bracing herself to be my companion in the future.

<blank>

I'm showing our guests around the village. Are you helping your father or mother, Ange?"

<blank>

Ange-chan energetically, "Uh-huh. I nodded.

When I patted him on the head, he looked happy and his face broke into a kitten-like smile.

I'll be your guide," she said, leading us on a tour of the barley cutting!　She led us on a tour of wheat harvesting.

With a proud smile on her face, Ange-chan pulled me by the hand and walked away!

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, I stayed with Angel after observing the wheat harvesting.

It was the result of Angel's vehement request,...... and it was the result of my and your parents,...... that is, Gilberto's son and his wife, who approached us with fervor and tears in their eyes. It was the result of ...... breaking down, but .......

<blank>

But the road trip with Angel was fun, and I am very grateful to her parents for allowing me to take her!

Mr. Arthur, too, kept his eyes relaxed on this lovely companion.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Every time I come to Amcam, my heart trembles at the miracle of this place."

<blank>

At the end of the day, on the hill where I guided him, he leaned his body against the log railing with his back to the lake and looked over the amkamu, squinting his eyes.

<blank>

In front of the observatory, with a yellow field of "golden canes" blooming and swaying in the background, I spread out a lotus pink gingham-checked cloth and finished preparing for a small tea party.

The lotus pink crosses look great on the golden field shimmering in the wind.

In this picturesque color scheme, Angel sits on a cross, looking very lovely.

<blank>

I gave her a pancake with bacon and a piece of jasmine jam on top, and she was so happy to see me that she chewed it up.

I wiped Angel's jam-covered cheeks and listened to Arthur's story.

<blank>

People in this country should know better that the richness of this country is due to the existence of this furthest land. Every time I come here, I can't help but think that.

<blank>

In the past, this land was too harsh an environment for people to live in.

Forest erosion undermines human habitation and steadily increases its power.

If nothing is done, one day this forest will cover the entire continent.

The people living there had no other way to survive but to resist the forest.

<blank>

The forests are overflowing with magical beasts, and as far as the land is concerned, crops do not grow well.

For food that they could not obtain satisfactorily, they had no choice but to rely on aid from other sources.

<blank>

Nevertheless, people continued to cut through the forest, expanding the area of human habitation and resisting the erosion of the forest.

<blank>

The trees in the forest are strong. It takes more than ordinary strength to cut through them.

If the wood is used for protection, it can withstand the attacks of magical beasts that come out of the forest.

They can use the fangs, claws, and bones of the monsters they hunt to make weapons against them.

Leather can be tanned and made into strong armor to protect against demonic beasts.

Any weapon with fangs or claws can reach them.

In this way, little by little, over a mind-boggling period of time, the men of Amkamu acquired the power against the demonic beasts in the forest of Irosio, .......

<blank>

As I listened to Arthur's story, I was reminded of such Amcam history that I had been taught by Howard Papa and in school.

<blank>

The people of the area have purified this land full of miasma into a clean land and transformed it into a forest rich in blessings, even though it is a forest of demons inhabited by magical beasts. The miracle of ......, or rather, the proof of the efforts of our predecessors, is now appearing here as a solid form.

<blank>

Mr. Arthur looked out over the land of Amkam, which can be seen from here, and spoke quietly as if he was showing compassion for it.

<blank>

That is why the crops harvested here are truly wonderful.

With that, he smiled and sat down on the rug to join the tea party.

He grabbed a large plum from among the fruits shared in the village and bit into it!　It's delicious!

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The next day, Howard Papa was to be their host as planned.

From that day on, they will be able to visit not only Amkam, but also the neighboring villages of Argosi and Marvel, and other villages in the Amkam district.

Whenever he returned from each village, Arthur would say that the water in that village was good and the wine was excellent. The goat's milk we drank in that village had a very rich flavor.

They really seemed to be enjoying themselves.

<blank>

So after four days of stay, the day came when Mr. Arthur and Mr. Reinwald left Amkam.

<blank>

We will never forget what you did for us. We will repay this favor no matter what it takes. Please remember that."

<blank>

Mr. Reinwald said so with a strong hand in his last one, but I didn't do much this time, just guiding Mr. Arthur instead of my dad.

I knew he must have been really happy to have renewed his old friendship with Howard's dad, I'm sure.

<blank>

I hear you're going off to college after this summer?"

<blank>

Mr. Arthur said that as he said goodbye.

I replied that I would leave AMCAM the month after next.

<blank>

I'm sure you can't go anywhere without people looking at you."

I don't think so! Oh, I think!

<blank>

I wonder what Arthur-san is going to say to me? And what's more, he seems to be having a little fun!

I intend to live inconspicuously! I have no intention of doing anything to attract attention!

We have the proper training for this! It's a hell of a thing to attract attention, don't you think?

<blank>

"Oh, really? Well, I can understand your father's feelings as I have a daughter of my own.

Do you have a daughter?"

'Oh, I have a daughter close to your age. I was alone on this trip because of the schedule, but ......, yes, I will definitely bring my daughter with me next time I come. Please, can you be a good friend to her then?"

Oh, yes! By all means."

'Oh, I thought for sure you guys would make good friends.

<blank>

Mr. Arthur said he would introduce me to his new friend, overflowing with his usual kind smile.

If she looks like her father, I can imagine that she must be a kind and beautiful woman.

I can't wait to see you now.

<blank>

While leaving us with such a pleasure, Mr. Arthur and his family left Amkam.

<blank>

<blank>

It was the first of the last summers of my childhood spent in Amcam.

<blank>

That summer I spent with everyone in the village was so dazzling and fun, and I was so happy to spend that time with them that I wanted it to last forever.

But time is certainly ticking away, and the summer sun is gradually getting shorter and shorter, signaling its end.

<blank>

And the 27th of the Red Month of 4.

The day to leave this Amcam that I love so much, Sonia Mom, Howard Dad and the others, has finally arrived.
