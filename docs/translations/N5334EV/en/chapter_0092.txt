# Episode 80: Visitors from the Royal Capital

"How many years has it been since you showed that fierce face?! Reinbart Kreiner!!"

"That's mutual, Howard!! You still look as robust as ever!"

<b>

The guests who arrived in the early afternoon are said to be old friends of Howard Papa from the royal capital.

It seems that this is the first time they have met face to face in over a decade.

Both of them are happily patting each other on the shoulder, rejoicing in their reunion.

<b>

Reinbart's deeply chiseled features are indeed imposing, as Howard Papa said, but his neatly groomed mustache and slicked-back white hair exude elegance, creating a dignified presence.

And those eyes, which harbor a calm yet sharp light, remind one of seasoned warriors like Howard Papa.

The countless old scars on his face and hands are proof of that and serve as medals of honor.

<b>

"You're Suzy, right? I've heard about you."

<b>

After greeting Howard Papa, Reinbart turned to me and smiled gently.

<b>

"Yes, I'm Suzy. Nice to meet you."

<b>

As I greeted the guests with a courtesy, Reinbart further relaxed his eyes and nodded.

I hope that means I did it correctly according to etiquette?

Elrose and Anna Mary, who are behind me, don't seem to have any expressions that suggest they want to say something, so it should be fine, right?

I just can't get used to these situations, and it's always a bit nerve-wracking for me...

But unusually, Anna Mary seems a bit tense today.

I wonder if today's guests hold quite a high status? Thinking that way makes me a little nervous...

<b>

"Reinbart! Even if you smile down from above with that face, it just looks scary to the other party, you know? I'm sorry, Little Lady, this man means no harm. It's a short time, but I'll be in your care. He's an old acquaintance of your father, so I'd be glad if you could treat him casually."

<b>

Pushing Reinbart aside, another guest spoke lightly, as if joking.

He seemed to sense my slightly tense feelings and his warm smile helped ease them.

<b>

The man who introduced himself as Arthur is smaller than Howard Papa, but he must be around 180 cm tall? He has a sturdy build.

He appears to be in his mid-50s. His soft, wavy flaxen hair and gentle, tawny eyes seem to reflect his warm personality.

<b>

Howard Papa and Sonia Mama only mentioned that the two guests are "old friends," but they haven't told me what their positions are.

Even so, their refined demeanor makes it easy to imagine that they hold important positions in the central region (the royal capital).

The atmosphere they exude is not at all inferior to that of the high-ranking nobles we welcome during the harvest festival.

So, I must not be rude! I was quite nervous about that. However, as if anticipating my feelings, Arthur directed a gentle smile at me.

From that, I could faintly see his depth of character and kindness.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Arthur and the others reportedly spend a few days in Amukamu every few years during their summer vacation.

He mentioned that this was his first visit to Amukamu in four years.

Arthur, who seemed very much looking forward to this long-awaited visit, quickly chased Howard Papa away to the first supply station after greeting us.

<b>

"Huh? Didn't we prepare tea?" Elrose said, glancing back at Sonia Mama, who shrugged and shook her head, smiling in disbelief.

<b>

"Shall we go ahead and start preparing dinner?"

<b>

Sonia Mama said that as she headed towards the kitchen.

<b>

"We have a whole boar that’s just come in, so let’s prepare a full course and surprise everyone! Hehe."

<b>

Sonia Mama said that and began to joyfully prepare the boar meat.

<b>

<b>

<b>

With plenty of effort, Sonia Mama, Elrose, and I (of course, Anna Mary was fully focused on serving...) completed the dinner.

That day's Amukamu boar full course was very well received by our guests.

Arthur and Reinbart enjoyed not only Sonia Mama's specialty Amukamu dishes like the boiled tongue and leg stew but also the potato pancakes I made from this year's harvest.

Arthur, while savoring the food, said that such a meal is hard to come by even in the royal capital, and that enjoying Amukamu's specialties here is the greatest pleasure.

<b>

At the livelier dining table than usual, both Howard Papa and Sonia Mama looked very happy.

It might be the first time I've seen Howard Papa laugh so joyfully like a boy.

Watching him made me feel happy too. Sonia Mama probably felt the same way. When our eyes met, we confirmed that our mouths were both smiling, and laughter spilled out even more.

<b>

After the meal, the men enjoyed a little alcohol while Anna Mary and I sipped the tea that Anna Mary had brewed, savoring that cheerful time.

Eventually, it quietly came to an end with the appearance of Jacob, the head butler from Amukamu House.

It seems that the two of them are indeed special guests, as they are staying in the best guest room at Amukamu House.

Jacob had come to pick them up in a carriage.

<b>

Arthur and the others apparently wanted to stay at our house, but it seems that wasn't possible.

Reinbart and Howard Papa promised to meet early in the morning at the training ground of Amukamu House and reluctantly left our home.

Howard Papa said he was looking forward to showing the two of them around the village starting tomorrow.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

However, for some reason, the task of accompanying Arthur fell to me the next day.

Reinbart, who had come along (probably as a bodyguard...), was still sweating it out at the Amukamu House training ground with Howard Papa since morning...

<b>

"I would like to ask you to guide him in place of your father."

<b>

Arthur, who was brought to the Cloud family by Jacob, the head butler, said with a smile.

Originally, Howard Papa was supposed to host the two during their stay, but it seems Arthur suggested that he wanted to cherish the friendship with his old friend after decades.

Sonia Mama also smiled with a troubled expression and said she would ask me for help.

<b>

Well, if it means I can see Howard Papa's happy face, then guiding them is a piece of cake for me!

Moreover, thinking of it as part of my role as the daughter of the Cloud family makes me feel a bit proud!

<b>

"I understand. Leave it to me!"

<b>

I said that, thumping my chest, and surprisingly took on the role.

<b>

<b>

<b>

First, Arthur said he wanted to see the harvest of Amukamu, so we decided to visit the production farms one by one.

<b>

Amukamu is indeed a village rich in agricultural products.

Of course, there are endless fields of wheat, and they yield many high-quality crops.

<b>

Amukamu corn is large and very sweet.

Freshly harvested ones in the early morning are practically like desserts on their own.

The farmers in this area often throw freshly picked ones at me when they see me running in the morning.

The sweetness at that moment is incredible!!

While running and munching on it may seem a bit uncouth, I can't help it when it’s so sweet that my cheeks feel like they might melt!

<b>

And Amukamu potatoes! When steamed, they become incredibly fluffy due to their high starch content!

The pancakes and galettes I made last night also used these potatoes.

That made them very delicious.

<b>

There are also a lot of berries.

The bright red strawberries are large and have very sweet flesh.

Even the raspberries are big and sweet, so if you eat them eagerly, your mouth quickly turns purple.

<b>

Arthur, upon tasting the freshly boiled corn, steamed potatoes, and just-picked berries, opened his eyes wide and enjoyed them all, looking very satisfied.

<b>

Of course, everyone who shared the crops with us, including myself, couldn't help but smile with pride and joy at the sight.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

One of Amukamu's proud landscapes, the vast wheat fields, had almost all been beautifully harvested since the cutting began last week.

The cut wheat ears were stacked up, and as the workers diligently worked, they greeted me with smiles whenever they noticed me.

<b>

"Lady Suzy!!"

<b>

Amidst that, I heard a lovely voice calling me from beyond a mound of stacked wheat.

<b>

The vast wheat harvest in Amukamu requires many hands.

During this time, the entire village comes together, but even then, more help is needed.

At such times, the people from Grassfoot, who have a settlement to the west of Amukamu, are reliable.

<b>

Howard Papa taught me that it was thanks to the Grassfoot people, known as "the people of the soil," that this once barren land became so rich.

These people are experts in handling crops.

The hardworking Grassfoot people skillfully cut the rice and stack the ears one after another.

<b>

From one of the stacked mounds, a small figure fluttered towards me.

It was a small girl running with her large apron dress swaying and her big ponytail bouncing.

Her hair was a warm, soft camel blonde, swaying beautifully in the wind.

<b>

She dashed towards me and dove into my arms.

I caught the dive of the six-year-old girl using the volume of my skirt to gently cushion her.

<b>

"Lady Suzy! Are you going somewhere?"

<b>

With sparkling eyes, this girl who hugged me is Angelica Gamzy.

Yes, she is the granddaughter of our Gilbert.

Following her grandfather Gilbert, who accompanies Howard Papa, Angel is a spirited child who is already eager to accompany me in the future!

<b>

"I'm currently showing our guests around the village. Are you helping your dad and mom?"

<b>

Angel nodded vigorously.

When I praised her by patting her head, her cheeks flushed with joy, and she smiled like a little kitten.

That Angel led us to observe the wheat harvesting, declaring, "I will guide you!"

With a proud smile, Angel held my hand and walked, looking incredibly cute!!

<b>

<b>

In the end, I stayed with Angel even after we observed the wheat harvesting.

This was the result of Angel's fervent request... it was a passionate and tearful approach that led me and her parents... namely, Gilbert's son and daughter-in-law... to relent...

<b>

However, the time spent with Angel was enjoyable, and I am very grateful to her parents for allowing us to go together!

Arthur also couldn't help but smile at this adorable companion.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Every time I come to Amukamu, my heart trembles at the miracles of this land."

<b>

At the last place I guided him that day, Arthur leaned against the log railing with the lake behind him, gazing over Amukamu with narrowed eyes as he spoke.

<b>

In front of the observation platform, I was finishing the preparations for a small tea party, spreading a lotus pink gingham check cloth against the backdrop of a field swaying with "Golden Rod."

The lotus pink cloth stands out beautifully against the golden field swaying in the wind.

In that picturesque color scheme, Angel, sitting on the cloth, looked very adorable.

<b>

Unable to contain her excitement for this little picnic, Angel was delighted when I handed her a bacon pancake topped with lingonberry jam, and she happily munched on it.

As I wiped the jam-stained cheeks of Angel while listening to Arthur's story, he continued.

<b>

"The people of this country should recognize that the richness of this far-flung land is what makes this country thrive. Every time I come here, I can't help but think that."

<b>

Once, this land was too harsh an environment for people to live in.

The encroachment of the forest eroded the places where people could dwell, and its influence steadily expanded.

If nothing is done, someday this forest will cover the entire continent.

The people living there had no choice but to resist the forest to survive.

<b>

Monsters overflowed from the forest, and the miasma-filled land barely allowed crops to grow.

The inadequate food supply had to rely on aid from elsewhere.

<b>

Yet, the people cleared the forest, expanded the areas where humans could live, and continued to resist the encroachment of the forest.

<b>

The trees of the forest are strong. To clear them requires more than average strength.

With the timber used for protection, they could withstand the attacks of the monsters coming from the forest.

Weapons could be made using the fangs, claws, and bones of the hunted monsters to counter them.

Leather could be tanned and turned into sturdy armor to protect against the monsters.

Weapons made from fangs and claws could reach them.

Thus, the people of Amukamu gradually, over what felt like an eternity, acquired the power to confront the monsters in the Iroshio Forest.

<b>

Listening to Arthur's story, I recalled the history of Amukamu that I learned from Howard Papa and at school.

<b>

"Eventually, the people purified this miasma-laden land into a clean one, transforming the cursed forest inhabited by monsters into a bountiful forest. That miracle... no, the proof of the efforts of our predecessors is now manifesting here in a tangible form."

<b>

As Arthur quietly spoke while gazing over the land of Amukamu from this vantage point, he seemed to cherish it.

<b>

That is why the crops harvested here are truly wonderful.

Saying that with a smile, he sat down on the cloth to join the tea party.

Then, from the fruits we received in the village, he picked a large plum and bit into it, exclaiming, "Delicious!" with a joyful expression.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

From the next day, as planned, Howard Papa became the host for the two of them.

From that day on, they would tour not only Amukamu but also nearby villages like Argoshi and Malver, throughout the Amukamu district.

Arthur spoke very happily about how the water in that village was good, the wine was excellent, and the goat's milk he drank there was rich and flavorful whenever he returned from each village.

<b>

After their four-day stay, the day came for Arthur and Reinbart to leave Amukamu.

<b>

"We will never forget what you have done for us. No matter what, we intend to repay this kindness. Please remember that."

<b>

Reinbart said that while squeezing my hand firmly at the end, but I really haven't done anything significant, just guided Arthur in place of Papa.

I guess they were truly happy to rekindle their old friendship with Howard Papa.

<b>

"It seems you will be advancing to school after this summer, right?"

<b>

Arthur said that while saying goodbye.

I replied that I would be leaving Amukamu in the following month.

<b>

"You, wherever you go, will surely attract people's attention."

"Th-that's not true! I-I don't think so!!"

<b>

What on earth is Arthur saying all of a sudden?! And he seems a bit amused too!!

I plan to live without drawing attention! I have no intention of doing anything that would attract people's eyes!

I've been training for that purpose! It's absolutely impossible for me to gather attention?!

<b>

"Hehe, is that so? I can understand your father's feelings well, as I too have a daughter."

"Y-you have a daughter?"

"Yes, I have a daughter around your age. Unfortunately, she couldn't join me on this trip due to scheduling conflicts... but next time I come, I will definitely bring her along. Please befriend her then, okay?"

"Y-yes! Definitely!"

"Oh, I thought you two would surely become good friends."

<b>

Arthur said that with his usual gentle smile, as he introduced me to a new friend.

If she resembles her father, I can imagine she will be a kind and beautiful person.

I am already looking forward to meeting her.

<b>

Leaving me with such anticipation, Arthur and the others departed from Amukamu.

<b>

<b>

That was the first event of the last summer of my childhood spent in Amukamu.

<b>

That summer spent with everyone in the village was incredibly bright and joyful, and I wished that time would last forever.

However, time certainly moves forward, and the summer sun gradually shortens, signaling its end.

<b>

And on the 27th of the Fourth Month.

The day finally came when I had to part from beloved Amukamu and Sonia Mama and Howard Papa.
