# Chapter 160: Fluorite Silk

"Especially the young lady who is a candidate for the saint! Thanks to you, Judy has come out unscathed! I can't thank you enough! Please allow me to prepare a special item for you as well!"

"Huh?! M-me?!"

<b>

The lady stepped away from Karen and leaned closer to me, speaking rapidly.

No, no! I'm not a candidate for the saint, you know?!

<b>

"But we have brought dresses, so there's no need to rush for next week, right?"

"That's right! There's no need to hurry! I think it would be nice to take our time after that child!"

<b>

Mia and Vivi seem to be planning to accept the thanks without particularly declining.

Well, since we're making Karen accept the thanks, we can't refuse, right?

<b>

"That's true. But since Sue has the year-end event coming up, wouldn't it be better to have it properly tailored?"

"“I see!”"

<b>

Huh? What? What is Colin talking about?

What about the year-end event?

Even Vivi and Mia are making faces like "That's right!" What are they agreeing on?

<b>

"That's right! Sue-chan, you brought the Large Crawler's thread before leaving the village, didn't you? Why not use that?"

"That's right! The spinning should be done by now, and the fabric should be ready!"

"Oh, that sounds good, doesn't it? I think it's very suitable."

<b>

Indeed, during the end of summer vacation when I was in the village, I encountered a Large Crawler around the mid-layer of the forest and collected its thread.

The "Large Crawler" is, as the name suggests, a huge caterpillar.

It's a gigantic chocolate bread over 5 meters long!

<b>

So the thread it spits out becomes quite large when gathered.

It's already turned into a big ball that easily exceeds 1 meter.

When I brought it back, everyone was very surprised, but both Papa Howard and the villagers were happy that it was something rare.

<b>

They said it was a rare item at that time, but what do they mean by "suitable"?

<b>

"Wait, wait a moment. Did I just hear Large Crawler's thread...? Could it be... are you talking about 'Fluorite Silk'...?"

"Oh, you know about the Large Crawler. Impressive. Yes, that's right. The fabric spun from the Large Crawler's thread is commonly referred to as 'Fluorite Silk.'"

"…Oh! No way… no way!"

<b>

Colin answered Barbara's question.

<b>

Come to think of it, they did say that thread becomes 'Fluorite Silk' when made into fabric.

It takes quite a while to spin the thread because magic power is mixed in, but once it's done, it becomes beautiful and strong, as Mama Sonia told me.

The fabric woven from the spun thread is said to be very soft and has a beautiful, faint glow. "Once the fabric is ready, let's have Cecily make some underwear for you!" Mama said. Apparently, the texture is so good that once you use it, you can't let go of it.

<b>

But somehow, Barbara is reacting excessively to the term "Fluorite Silk."

She seems to be trembling with emotion, as if overwhelmed?

<b>

<b>

"‘Fluorite Silk’! Its unparalleled softness and dreamlike texture. The way it shimmers faintly and fleetingly due to the magic power it holds captivates many, making it a rare item! And it possesses an unexpected durability that matches its delicate and ephemeral quality due to its high magical retention! Currently, there are dresses made of Fluorite Silk that have existed for over 200 years in the royal capital, and their quality is said to be increasing in brilliance rather than diminishing! The fabric itself hasn't been on the market for over 50 years! The last time I was able to touch it directly was 20 years ago! How on earth did you come by such a thing?!!"

<b>

She just rushed through that all at once!

The value standards for fabric seem quite different from those in the village, don't they?!

And Barbara's pressure is intense! She's coming on really strong, isn't she?!

Could it be that these two are a couple of similar tastes?!

<b>

"They are from Amukamu, you see. More than anything, she, Miss Suzy Cloud, is the daughter of the current head of Amukamu and the next head as well."

"What?!"

<b>

The student council president, Lineburger, casually referred to me as the "next head" to the Barbara couple!!

Why is the brightness of her smile increasing even more?! Her face is sparkling even more brightly, isn't it?!

<b>

"This is the will of the gods! Oh, goddess of fate who spins threads, Moilna, I thank you for your guidance!"

<b>

Upon hearing that, the couple immediately turned back to me, uttering words of gratitude to the goddess.

Feeling even more pressure from their stance, I instinctively took a step back.

<b>

"Please, let us take care of this! I never expected to encounter such a rare material!"

"If we notify 'Hato' now, I think the actual item will arrive in about a week."

"Then! Then! I must compile the design ideas by then! After that, once I see the actual item! Inspiration will surely flow endlessly! Oh! I must tell Judy quickly! I can't stay like this! We must hurry to our shop! First, we need to take everyone's measurements!"

<b>

It feels like the conversation is progressing at a whirlwind pace, but is it just my imagination?!

It seems like only Karen and I are the ones going "Huh? Huh?" and can't keep up with the conversation, while everyone else is moving forward with "Come on, let's get this done quickly."

<b>

Amidst all this, Karen and I were just holding hands, feeling bewildered.

We were strangely intimidated by everyone's smiles.
