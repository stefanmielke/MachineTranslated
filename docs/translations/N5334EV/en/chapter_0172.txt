# 160 - Episode 160 - Florite Silk

Especially you, young lady candidate for sainthood! Thanks to you, Judy is without a scratch on her body! I can't thank you enough! Please allow me to make you a very special one!"

"Huh? It's me, isn't it?

<blank>

Mrs. Huang moved away from Karen and came closer to me, this time with her face close to mine, and started to roll up her hair.

No, no, no! I am not a candidate for sainthood!

<blank>

But we brought our dresses, so we don't have to make it next week.

I agree! There's no need to rush! I think it would be better if we could take our time and ask him after he's done!"

<blank>

Mia and Bibi did not particularly refuse, and seemed to be ready to accept the thank-you in the usual way.

Well, we can't say no to Karen if she is going to accept our gratitude.

<blank>

I guess so. But Sue has the end of the year coming up, so I think it would be better to have it tailored properly anyway, don't you?"

I see!"

<blank>

What? What? What is Colin talking about?

What's the end of the year thing?

Even Bibi and Mia look at each other like, "Yes! What are they convinced of?

<blank>

Yes, I did! Sue, before you left the village, you brought the thread of the Large Crawler. Why don't you ask him to use it?"

I know," he said! The yarn has been spun and should be ready to be used as fabric by now!

"Oh, that's good, isn't it? I think it's very appropriate."

<blank>

Indeed, at the end of the summer vacation when I was in the village, I met a large crawler just beyond the middle of the forest and collected its threads.

The "Large Crawler" is, as the name suggests, a large caterpillar.

It is a giant chocolate bread over 5 meters long!

<blank>

Therefore, the threads that it spits out are also quite large when put together.

It was already a large ball, lightly over a meter long.

When I brought it home, I was very surprised, but Howard's father and everyone in the village was happy to see that it was something that is rarely harvested.

<blank>

Even then I was told it was a rare item, but what is "appropriate"?

<blank>

Wait a minute. I just heard you say Large Crawler's Thread. ...... If I may ...... ask, are you talking about 'florite silk' ......?"

Oh my, did you know about Large Crawlers? It's quirky, isn't it? Yes, I have. The fabric spun from large crawler yarn is commonly called 'florite silk.

"...... Oh! Oh no ...... no way, no way!"

<blank>

Colin answered Barbara's question.

<blank>

Well, I remember you saying that that thread is called 'florite silk' or something like that when it is made into fabric.

Sonia-mama told me that it takes quite a long time to knead the magic power and spin the yarn, but when it is done, it is beautiful and strong.

The fabric woven with spun yarn is very soft and has a beautiful pale glow, she said. When the fabric is ready, we will have it made into underwear at Cecily's place! Mom said. The fabric is so soft to the touch that once you use it, you won't be able to put it down.

<blank>

But, Barbara, you seem to be responding to the word "florite silk".

You're pulling like you're in a state of shock, you know that?

<blank>

<blank>

Floralight Silk"! The unparalleled suppleness and dreamy feel of this exquisite silk. The way it is tinged with a pale, fleeting radiance when covered with magic power is a rare gem that attracts many people! The high magical power it retains gives it an enduring strength that is not matched by its supple, fragile texture! There is a dress made of florite silk that was made more than 200 years ago still exists in the capital, and its quality has not diminished, but is still shining brightly! The fabric itself has not been on the market for more than 50 years! It has been 20 years since I was able to touch it directly! How on earth did you manage to get your hands on such a thing?

<blank>

Something was wound up all at once!

I feel that the standard of value for dough is very far from that of the village?

And Barbara's pressure is incredible! He is coming so hard!

Are they a similar couple by any chance?

<blank>

They are from Amkham. "They are from Amkam," he said, "and above all, she, Miss Suzy Cloud, is the daughter of the current Amkam leader and the next head of the Amkam family.

What?

<blank>

I am so proud of you, Mr. President Rheinberger, for calling me "the next head of the school" in front of Barbara and her husband!

Why is your smile even fresher? Why is the shimmer around your face even more dazzling?

<blank>

'This is the will of the gods! O Moyluna, goddess of yarn-spinning destiny, we thank you for your guidance!"

<blank>

The couple turned to me as soon as they heard this and expressed their gratitude to the goddess.

I feel further pressure from the sight of them and back off a bit.

<blank>

I am sure you will be very pleased with my work! I never thought I would come across such a rare material!"

If you send a 'pigeon' now, you should receive the original in about a week."

Then! Then! I have to put together a design plan by then! I'll have to wait until I see the actual product! I'm sure that inspiration will flow out of you endlessly! Oh, I can't wait to tell Judy about it! I'll have to let Judy know soon! We can't afford to stay here! Let's hurry up and get to our store! We need to get you all measured first!"

<blank>

I feel like the story is moving at a furious pace, but is it my imagination?

Only Karen and I said, "What? What? but everyone else was like, "Come on, let's get on with it.

<blank>

Karen and I were holding hands and looking at each other in bewilderment.

It was me and Karen, who were strangely intimidated by the smiles on everyone's faces.
