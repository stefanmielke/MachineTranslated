# 51 - Millie Barrett's Report.

Yeah, all clear today, as usual!"

<blank>

I was talking to no one.

<blank>

'Well, I don't think there's anything to it now...'

<blank>

Ketty came back with an answer as she polished the magical bead attached to her glove.

<blank>

Surely, Ketty is not the only one who thinks so.

Of course, the same goes for me, Millie, Irta and Aria.

I am sure all of us in "Team Aria" feel the same way.

<blank>

Even if it is! Don't let your guard down! It's our job to get you home safely! We'll stay on our toes and finish the job!

<blank>

Oh!ã€€and all went to reply to Aria's proclamation.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Today is the sixth day that we, "Team Aria," have been escorting Suzy's daughter.

When tomorrow morning arrives, the young lady's ordeal will be successfully completed and we will be done with our work.

<blank>

As a matter of fact, the young lady has proceeded through this ordeal to date without any danger at all.

There have hardly been any children who have gone through the ordeal so smoothly, have there?

<blank>

Of course, there are always unconventional children.

The Haggard family siblings are at the top of the list, and our leader, Alia, is also a member of that group.

<blank>

However, they are the embodiment of what is called "wild children," who are the embodiment of physical strength, so they cannot be measured in terms of how well they are doing or how poorly they are doing.

<blank>

But in the case of this Suzy lady, doesn't she surpass even that?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

On the first day, when I walked out into the forest with a backpack far larger than my own body on my back, I was honestly worried.

<blank>

I know that he has extraordinary strength, but I still felt uneasy when I saw him carrying such a large baggage on his back.

<blank>

However, these concerns were soon replaced by astonishment.

Even with such a large baggage on her back, the young lady went through the forest at a tremendous speed!

<blank>

They weaved their way through the roadless trees as if they were walking on level ground!

<blank>

To be honest, I was in a hurry.

We almost lost them.

<blank>

I am also proud of my role as a scout for Team Aria.

No matter how substandard the young lady may be, it is unforgivable to lose sight of someone who is carrying a large load!

That was it, and I chased it as hard as I could!

<blank>

I was not the only one who thought so, and the other three seemed to be in a great hurry to be left behind...but at least I managed to save face....

<blank>

I think the young lady had been rummaging around for a while for a possible encampment.

<blank>

There were several places along the way that looked like they would be easy to camp, but the young lady did not like them...she finally chose a small hilltop in the bushes.

<blank>

At this time, I was still awestruck by the way he climbed up the bad footholds without a care in the world.

It is not something that can be easily ascended in such a place, even without luggage.

<blank>

<blank>

But the truly astonishing part came later.

In half a day, the young lady had transformed a dense hilltop into a campsite!

<blank>

It is a tremendous amount of magic!

Even though the space is not that large, the amount of work involved is extraordinary.

It must have taken the strength of five big men to finish in half a day.

<blank>

She even started making firewood after that, and just when you think she's finished, she goes hunting even though the sun is already setting! How hardworking is your daughter?

<blank>

Moreover, the hunt was an extraordinary one.

<blank>

As if he knew where the prey was hiding from the beginning, he ran down the mountain at an incredible speed in a straight line without hesitation and killed the rabbit with a knife throw from a long distance!

<blank>

Even I, a hunter, didn't realize that a horned rabbit was lurking around until the lady threw a knife.

<blank>

In just one day, I felt like I was once again shown how substandard your daughter is.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

...the substandardness of the young lady...yes, that was still fresh in my mind, last year's Sougetsu in 5.

That day when the village was flooded with magical beasts.

<blank>

A red trail that flies in all directions, kicking off shadow dogs and brute bats.

With one stroke of his brilliant swordsmanship, he obliterated several Brutal Bats, and the next moment he had cut both Shadow Dogs in half.

<blank>

The image of the young lady, with her two swords gleaming as if she were dancing and her young grass-colored skirt fluttering daintily around, is still burned in the back of my mind's eye.

<blank>

There are many people in the village who were enchanted by her appearance that day and became worshippers of the young lady.

Of course, I am one of them!

<blank>

<blank>

Even though I knew of his appearance, I was still amazed when I was shown his power once again!

<blank>

But! Such tears shown on the first day by such an outstandard young lady!

I am relieved to see her like that, as if it is appropriate for her age.

<blank>

Oh, God! Oh my God! I knew I should have just flown over and hugged him then!

'Stop it, Aria! You'll ruin your daughter's ordeal!"

I don't know about you, but I'm not going to let you do this! It's our duty to be there for you when you need us!

I don't think that was an 'emergency,' you know?"

Oh! If I could at least snuggle with him!"

Stop it, Aria, something smells criminal."

"Hi, isn't it awful? Millie?

Aria's lack of interest in men led her to girlie things."

"Keti, Keti?

<blank>

As usual, our team treats its leader roughly.

<blank>

I don't care about that, Millie! Are you going ahead with your report?"

We're doing everything right! We're doing everything right!"

I think you know what I mean! That report is the basis for the latest article in the Bulletin!"

Of course, Aria! I'm not going to let anything happen to you!

<blank>

I gave a big thumbs up back to Aria.

<blank>

There is no way I would have missed her move!

I go straight to putting on the goggle-type reading glasses on my forehead, and operate the dial to focus on the young lady.

These goggles are one of my favorites, which I asked Marie Belle of the Cauzbert workshop to sell me!

The price at the store was 25.00, but after much persistence, I got it for 15.00 per month!

It is the pride of the workshop with 16x magnification, night vision in the left eye and magic vision in the right eye!

This way, your daughter's movements are always perfectly captured!

<blank>

The other day, I was bathing in the water! Oh, oh, oh, oh, I saw your daughter! I made sure of it!

I knew that your daughter has a good style because I sized her up in the store....

Recently, the body has become more full-bodied and feminine lines have become more noticeable, but I never had a chance to see them in person... but I never thought it would be this far...

No way...oh, oh, oh...such a cute little ass! No, no, no! It's nothing!

<blank>

But! That was a close call, sir! If Aria had witnessed it by mistake...I can only see an unfortunate future!

<blank>

...but now, unfortunately...no, no! Now that the ivy is hanging down well and out of sight, we can rest assured! We make sure they are bathed safely every morning!

<blank>

And now! The distance from here to the top of the small mountain where the lady is located is about 70 meters in a straight line.

The elevation here is only 7 to 8 meters higher, so from this vantage point, we can look down and see the young lady.

You are now practicing swordsmanship, which has become a daily routine for you.

<blank>

I am sure that they will not be able to go hunting anymore.

Food should have been well-stocked.

Steam is still rising from the pot on the stove.

It's almost noon, and I might be getting a little hungry too...

<blank>

In fact, the smell of the young lady's cooking often wafts up to here...it's tough!

<blank>

Why do they cook so well? How can they cook so deliciously?

We have enough dried meat and dried bread for portable meals, so we don't have to worry about food... but there is definitely nothing here that looks that good!

You are having "ordeals" and your diet....it's funny, Miss?

<blank>

Why is the young lady also so high in girl power?

Strong, cute, and a great cook...it's a great foul!

<blank>

Aria, for example, has a hard time drooling when the smell of her daughter's cooking wafts in the air!

<blank>

You're the one who's always drooling, aren't you? Millie!

Hi-." People! Don't come into my monologue, Aria!"

I don't know what you're talking about!

I say your daughter's home-cooked food looks delicious!"

I have to admit, the smells wafting up here are appetizing.

Miss Susie will make a good bride, that's for sure."

Right? You think so too, don't you Ketty? You want her for your wife, don't you?

But when Aria says it, it smells so much like a crime, you'd better not."

Why?

<blank>

It seems that this MANZAI promise is already fixed.

<blank>

I wonder, Millie, if your daughter is working out right now?"

Ah! That's right, Ilta! I'm in sword training!"

I feel like I'm... using... magic... is it a sword?"

Oh, you know what I mean? The sword is being used to make a small amount of water. I can see a faint trace of magic power on the sword.

It's hard to tell because of the sheer amount of magic in the original, but I can tell he's using it in a haunting way."

"Wow, your daughter's magic is that great too, huh?"

It's amazing. It's like they're training me to control it now to keep it down... but it's still far bigger than I am now."

I'm like, "Wow, really? Even your magic is out of standard?"

It's not even close to standard! I'm holding back right now, but the potential is beyond 'AAA' and in the Exceeds class!"

'Uh-oh! Miss! How much is that?

I'm so proud of you, Susie! You're just the wife I've always wanted, aren't you?

Finally, Aria has made up her mind to commit a crime.

Ketty?" Are you still pulling that story?!!!!"

It's the same with Aria."

Ahh! But! What class will such a young lady choose after this "ordeal"? And what kind of class master will she become in the future? I get excited just imagining it!"

I'm a master of the sword, after all! It may be too late to say this, but from "Swordsman" we can go to "Swordmaster" via "Warrior" or "Vanguard", can't we? And then "Battlelord", right? Or else, you could follow in the footsteps of the Gasho and lead the group as a "Warlord"? What do you think?

<blank>

That is a wonderful...wonderful prediction of the future! The fierce men of the village led by the young lady! I can see it in my eyes! ...but!

<blank>

But you are also a good scout! You have the ability to spot prey in a wide area, and the dexterity to kill them quickly and quietly. All of these qualities are first class! And the young lady is a two-sword wielder! A good ranger at a high level uses two swords to open up the front line!

There are those who use two swords as a 'bird'. And I heard that the young lady also uses the summoning technique. Warlock' should also be an option. If you want to fight on the front line, you can change your class to 'battle mage.

Wait, you're already a high-level healer, remember? The growth of a good healer is necessary for the group and for everyone in the village.

<blank>

While having lunch prepared by Ilsa, before we knew it, we were all talking passionately about the class that the young lady was about to enter.

Of course, your daughter's future is for her to decide for herself, and what we are saying is just our own speculation.

Still, I can't help but get excited when I think of the young lady, the village, and the Protectorate ahead!

<blank>

Well, then, I'm going to take Millie's report and come back to the packing house. This is the last report on the way. Everyone, stay on your toes until the end!

I know, Alia! Leave it to me!

Be careful on the road, Aria."

Thank you, Ilta. I'll be back by evening, so take care of everyone."

Please don't commit any crimes.

Is that a promise already?

<blank>

After a somewhat noisy departure, Aria went to the I Tsumesho.

<blank>

Come on! Only a few more days left of the "ordeal"!

Let's do our best! Miss!



<blank>

----------------

Hey, Colin... maybe it's time to forgive him...?"

What are you talking about? Mia?"

"......"

So! It's Dana! Dana! It's been five days. Can't we just talk to each other?

'Well...Dana? ...I don't know her."

Yadaaaaayyyy! Yada yada yada! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Coreen! I won't do it again! I won't say it! Forgive me, Coreen! Please, please, please!

So! That's why! I told you to stop hugging me like that! God!

I'm going to say, "No, no, no, no, no! You have to forgive me! Oh, no, no, no, no, please! I'll do anything you say, please forgive me!

'Okay, okay, don't hang on! Oh, God! Will you listen to me? Are you going to study?"

I'll study...! I'll study...I'll study..."

I'm not going to let you do it! All right, all right, all right! I forgive you! Don't cry!"

"Hmmm, yeah! I'm sorry! Colleen sorry! Thank you! Aaaaannnnn!

I'm not going to let you do it! That's why! Don't squeeze me!
