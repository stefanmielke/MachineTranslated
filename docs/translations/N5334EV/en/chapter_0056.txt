# Chapter 51: Report of Millie Barrett

"Yeah, no abnormalities today, just like usual!"

<b>

I said this without directing it to anyone in particular.

<b>

"Well, I don't think anything will happen at this point..."

<b>

Katy replied while polishing the magic orb attached to her glove.

<b>

Surely, Katy isn't the only one thinking that way.

Of course, I, Millie, and Ilta and Aria feel the same.

All of us in 'Team Aria' must undoubtedly think so.

<b>

"Even so! Don't let your guard down?! Our job isn't done until we safely deliver her home! We’ll see it through to the end without being careless!"

<b>

"Yeah!" Everyone responded to Aria's rallying cry.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Today marks the sixth day since we, 'Team Aria', began our escort of Lady Suzy.

Once we welcome tomorrow morning, the lady's trial will be successfully concluded, and our job will be finished.

<b>

In reality, the lady has been progressing through this trial without any issues up to today.

Has there ever been a child who has navigated the trial this smoothly before?

<b>

Of course, there are always unconventional children.

The Haggard siblings are the prime example, and our leader Aria is one of them.

<b>

However, they embody a kind of wildness that can’t be measured by the scales of smoothness or roughness.

<b>

But in the case of Lady Suzy, isn't she surpassing even that?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

On the first day, when she set off into the forest with a backpack far larger than her own body, I was honestly just worried.

<b>

It's something that anyone from the village, including us, has done, and I know she possesses extraordinary strength, but seeing her with such a heavy load made me feel anxious.

<b>

However, that worry quickly turned into astonishment.

Despite carrying such a heavy load, the lady moved through the forest at an incredible speed!

<b>

She navigated through the trees as if she were walking on flat ground!

<b>

I was honestly flustered.

I almost lost sight of her.

<b>

I take pride in having served as the scout for Team Aria.

No matter how unconventional the lady is, losing sight of someone carrying a heavy load is unacceptable!

I ran as hard as I could to catch up!

<b>

Of course, I wasn't the only one thinking that way; the other three were also panicking as they were left behind... but at least I managed to maintain some dignity...

<b>

For a while, I think the lady was scouting for a suitable camping spot.

<b>

There were several places that seemed easy to camp, but perhaps they didn't meet the lady's standards... ultimately, she chose a small hill covered in bushes.

<b>

Even at that time, I was amazed by how she climbed up a difficult spot with ease.

Such places aren't easy to ascend even without a load.

<b>

<b>

However, what was truly astonishing came afterward.

In just half a day, the lady transformed the dense hilltop into a campsite!

<b>

What an incredible amount of magical power!

Even if the area isn't that large, the amount of work done is extraordinary.

To finish in half a day would require the strength of five grown men, wouldn't it?

<b>

Moreover, after starting to gather firewood, just when I thought she was done, she went hunting even as the sun was setting! How hardworking is the lady?!

<b>

And that hunt was something else.

<b>

As if she already knew where the prey was hiding, she dashed down the mountain at an incredible speed, throwing a knife from a distance to take down a horned rabbit!

<b>

Even as a hunter, I didn't realize the horned rabbit was hiding until the lady threw her knife.

<b>

In just one day, I was once again shown the lady's extraordinary abilities.

<b>

<b>

<b>

...The lady's extraordinary abilities... Yes, that memory is still fresh from last year's fifth blue moon.

The day when magical beasts flooded the village.

<b>

Flying around freely, scattering shadow dogs and brutal bats, a red streak.

With a single stroke of her elegant swordsmanship, she obliterated several brutal bats, and in the next moment, she cleaved a shadow dog in two.

<b>

Her figure, dazzling with two swords, twirling gracefully in her young grass-green skirt, is still etched in my mind.

<b>

On that day, many villagers were captivated by her and became her admirers.

Of course, I am one of them!!

<b>

<b>

Even knowing such a figure, I am still continuously astonished when I see her power again!

<b>

But still! The tears she showed on the first day!

Seeing her like that made me feel that she is indeed age-appropriate, and it warmed my heart.

<b>

"Ah! I should have just flown over and hugged her at that time!!"

"Stop it, Aria! That would ruin the lady's trial, right?!"

"Even so, Ilta! Isn't it our duty to be there for her in times of need?!"

"I don't think that was 'a time of need' though?"

"Ah! If only I could have at least slept beside her!"

"Please stop, Aria, it sounds kind of criminal."

"Isn't that harsh? Millie?!"

"Aria has turned to girly interests because no boys are approaching her."

"K-Katy?!"

<b>

As usual, our team treats the leader rather carelessly.

<b>

"More importantly, Millie! Are you making progress on the report?"

"You don't need to worry! I'm making good progress!"

"I know you understand, but that report is the basis for the latest article in the newsletter!"

"Of course, Aria! I won't let anything slip through the cracks!"

<b>

I gave Aria a firm thumbs up.

<b>

There's no way I would miss the lady's movements!

I immediately put on my goggle-type telescope and adjusted the dial to focus on the lady.

This goggle is my favorite item that I begged Marie Bell from the Cowzbart workshop to sell to me!

Originally priced at 25 Owls, I managed to negotiate it down to 15 Owls on a monthly payment plan!

With a magnification of 16 times, the left eye has night vision, and the right eye has magical sight—it's a proud piece of craftsmanship from the workshop!!

With this, I can always capture the lady's movements perfectly!!

<b>

Just the other day, I—while she was bathing! I—saw the lady! I confirmed it properly!!

I knew the lady had a good figure since I had fitted her at the store...

Recently, her curves have become more pronounced, and her feminine lines have become more noticeable, but I had never had the chance to see her directly... but I never expected it to be to this extent...

I mean, such a cute little bottom... ah, ah! No! It's nothing!

<b>

But! That was a close call! If Aria had happened to witness it, I can only imagine a regrettable future!

<b>

...But now, unfortunately... no, no! Right now, the vines are hanging down just right, obscuring the view, so I'm relieved! I confirm every morning that she bathes safely!

<b>

And now! The straight-line distance to the hilltop where the lady is located is about 70 meters.

Since this spot is slightly 7-8 meters higher in elevation, I can see the lady's condition from here.

Right now, it seems she is practicing her daily sword training.

<b>

I think she probably won't go hunting anymore.

She must have stored enough food by now.

Steam is rising from the pot over the fire.

It's almost lunchtime, so I might be getting a bit hungry...

<b>

In fact, the smell of the lady's cooking often drifts this far, but... it's quite intense!

<b>

During the 'trial', even though we're supposed to procure food locally, how can she cook something that smells so delicious?!

Our food consists of portable dried meat and hardtack, so we won't have trouble with meals... but such delicious food is definitely not here!

Even during the 'trial', the food situation... isn't it strange, Lady?!

<b>

Why is the lady so high in feminine charm?!

Strong, cute, and on top of that, good at cooking... it's quite an unfair advantage!

<b>

When the smell of the lady's cooking wafts over, Aria drools uncontrollably!

<b>

"Isn't it you who always drools? Millie!!"

"Yikes! Don't interrupt my monologue, Aria!"

"I don't understand what you're saying?!"

"I'm saying the lady's home-cooked meals look delicious!!"

"Indeed, the smell drifting this far is quite appetizing."

"Lady Suzy will definitely make a great wife, that's for sure."

"Right?! Katy thinks so too, right?! I definitely want her as my wife!"

"But when Aria says it, it sounds criminal, so you should stop."

"Why?!"

<b>

It seems this MANZAI routine has become fixed.

<b>

"More importantly, Millie, is the lady still training?"

"Ah! Yes, Ilta! She's training with her sword!"

"...It feels like she's using magic... but with a sword?"

"Ah, can you tell? It seems she's slightly infusing it with magic as she practices. I can faintly see traces of magical light along the sword's path."

"It's hard to tell because her original magical power is so immense, but I can sense she's using it faintly."

"Wow, the lady has such incredible magical power too, huh?"

"She does. It seems she's currently controlling it during training, but even so, it's far greater than mine."

"Wow, really? Her magical power is also extraordinary?"

"Extraordinary is an understatement! She's currently suppressing it, so it's only that much, but her potential exceeds 'AAA' and is in the exceed class!"

"Whoa! Lady! How much is that?!!"

"Of course, Suzy is worthy of becoming my wife!"

"It seems Aria has finally made up her mind to get involved in crime."

"Katy?! Are you still dragging that topic out?!!"

"That's the same for Aria."

"Ah! But! After this 'trial', what class will the lady choose? And what kind of class master will she become in the future?!! Just imagining it makes me excited!!"

"Well, considering she's such a master swordsman, it might be a bit late, but she'll probably go from 'Swordman' to 'Warrior' or 'Vanguard' and then to 'Swordmaster'! And then straight to 'Battle Road', right? Or maybe she'll succeed the chief and lead the members as a 'Warlord'? What do you think?!"

<b>

That is a wonderful... wonderful prediction for the future! Warriors of the village led by the lady! I can picture it vividly!!... But!

<b>

"However, the lady also has a high aptitude for the scout profession! Her ability to search for prey over a wide area and her skill in quietly and swiftly taking down prey are all top-notch! Plus, the lady is a dual-wielder! A high-level skilled 'Ranger' uses dual swords to carve a path on the front lines!"

"There are also those who use dual swords as 'Bards'. And I've heard the lady also uses summoning magic. 'Warlock' should also be an option. If she's going to fight on the front lines, class-changing to 'Battle Mage' is also a possibility."

"Wait, the lady is already a skilled user of high-level healing magic, right? The growth of an excellent healer is essential for the party and the village."

<b>

While enjoying the lunch prepared by Ilta, we somehow began to passionately discuss the class the lady would take in the future.

Of course, the lady's future is something she will decide for herself, and what we are saying is merely our own speculations.

Even so, just thinking about the lady's future, the village's future, and the militia's future makes me unable to contain my excitement!

<b>

"Well then, I will take this Millie's report and head back to the outpost now. This will be the last interim report. Everyone, don't let your guard down until the end!"

"I understand, Aria! Leave it to us!"

"Be careful on your way back too."

"Thanks, Ilta. I'll be back by evening, so please take care of everyone."

"Please don't get involved in any crime, okay?"

"Is that a promise now?!"

<b>

It was a somewhat noisy departure, but Aria headed towards the first outpost.

<b>

Now! The 'trial' is almost at its end!

Let's do our best, Lady!!

<b>

----------------

"Hey, Corin... isn't it time to forgive her... maybe?"

"What are you talking about, Mia?"

"……"

"That's right! It's Dana! Dana! It's been five days, right? Let's just talk to her already?"

"Now... Dana? I don't know that child."

"I don't want to—! I don't want to! I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Corin! I won't do it again! I won't say anything! Please forgive me, Corin!! Pleaseee!!"

"Stop! I told you to stop suddenly hugging me!! Enough already!"

"I don't want to! I don't want to! If you don't forgive me, I don't want to! Waaa, waaa, please! I'll do anything you say—please forgive meee!!"

"I-I get it, so stop clinging to me! Come on! Will you listen? Will you study properly?"

"Eh, w-what! I-I'll do it... I'll study..."

"Alright! I get it! I'll forgive you! So stop crying!"

"Y-yeah! I'm sorry—! Corin, I'm sorry—!! Thank you—! Aaaahhh!!"

"Stop! I told you! Don't squeeze meeeeee!!!"

Next time: "The Flood of Amukam Forest"
