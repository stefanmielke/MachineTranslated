# Interlude 3: Magic Extraction

Happy New Year!

This is the first post of the year.

<b>

An episode I was going to include in Chapter 73 but decided to discard.

----------------

<b>

Team Aria said they were going to investigate the pig nest they found during the recent rescue of Papa Howard, so I was allowed to join them.

Since all the orcs that were likely in that nest had probably been absorbed by the undead and turned into orc zombies, there shouldn't be any threat from the nest, but it seems we need to confirm if there are any victims.

<b>

<b>

To be honest, if even one of those guys is still alive, I plan to burn the nest to the ground! Hahaha!

Whether Aria knows my intentions or not, she firmly grabbed my shoulder and repeatedly warned me, "Listen! Don't do anything unnecessary?!"

<b>

I understand! I wouldn't just go around causing chaos!

I felt like Aria and Iltar-san looked at me with a bit of skepticism when I said it was fine, but I'm sure it was just my imagination!

<b>

<b>

And for some reason, Anna Merry is with us again this time.

Anna Merry insists that it's her duty to accompany me wherever I go!

Well, I already knew Anna Merry's abilities from the last time, so I wasn't worried about her joining us.

<b>

At the time of departure, Mia also tried to come along, but of course, she wasn't given permission and was held back by everyone.

I think what Dana did at that time wasn't just holding her back; she was grabbing her!

I must say... that was mine!! Kyaaa!

<b>

But when Mia, who was being held back, and Anna Merry's gazes crossed in mid-air, I felt like sparks were flying. I wonder why?

Mia's regretful voice afterward and Anna Merry's contrasting pure smile left a deep impression... What on earth happened between those two? It's a mystery!

<b>

<b>

Well, it's not like we're going on a long journey!

We're just going to investigate that place and come back, so it feels more like a short trip, staying 1-2 nights at most.

After all, it's Team Aria, which has a team rank of "A," right? Aria herself will be promoted to "A" next month too!

There's nothing to worry about!

<b>

The location is about 25-26 kilometers from the village.

Last time, we covered that distance in one go on horseback, but this time we'll be walking.

It's a journey that took the large knight order several days, but for the people of Amukam, who know the forest well, it shouldn't take more than a day on foot.

Even though the forest is heavily eroded, the path has been sufficiently established by the knight order's round trips.

There were some magical beasts along the way, but Team Aria dealt with them without any trouble.

<b>

<b>

And it appeared just before we arrived at our destination.

Well, I sensed its presence.

I didn't think this group would fall behind, and more importantly, Aria quickly noticed it and took a stance.

<b>

"Ugooo!!"

<b>

In an instant, Aria let out a groan that seemed to come from deep within her throat, and a sound like a gong echoed around us as she staggered, as if she had caught a cannonball with her two battle axes crossed in front of her.

<b>

The white mass that Aria deflected while bracing herself was sent flying into the trees and disappeared.

<b>

"Be careful! It's a Snuff Rabbit!!"

<b>

At Aria's shout, everyone braced themselves on the spot.

Iltar-san cast a spell, deployed a magical shield, and Keti-san summoned a spirit to grow plants to block the Snuff Rabbit's path.

However, the rabbit, with its natural speed, slipped through the obstacles and lunged at the team.

<b>

Hmm. I didn't feel that much of a threat when I encountered it before...

It seems like Aria and the others are feeling quite anxious?

Well, it's true that if I took a critical hit from this thing, my head would probably fly off in an instant.

<b>

And that white furball darted past Keti-san's obstacles, avoided Anna Merry's wire barrier, exploited Team Aria's blind spots, and charged straight at me!

<b>

"Young lady?!!"

<b>

As the white devil slipped through the encirclement of Team Rank A, Anna Merry caught sight of it and raised her voice.

Yes, it was coming straight for me.

<b>

In an instant, it closed the ten-meter distance, kicking off the ground.

With a loud thud, the white furball approached right in front of me! And I...

<b>

<b>

I grabbed it by the scruff of its neck.

<b>

Piggyyyyy! It let out a strange sound as if it was being crushed, probably because its own momentum was pulling its skin and tightening its throat!

As it squirmed in my hand, I flicked its forehead to stop it immediately.

This dangerous creature must be exterminated quickly! Yes!

<b>

"Y-You caught that...?"

"Young lady, you can see that...?"

"With just a fingertip... is that a kill?"

"......Astonishing."

"As expected of you, young lady! Truly impressive!!"

<b>

I feel like they're half amazed, but I'll set that aside for now...

It seems this thing is one of the troublesome magical beasts around here.

Its combat power isn't particularly high, but it's incredibly fast and difficult to catch.

One hit is heavy, but anyone with a rank that can reach this area should be able to endure it.

What we need to be wary of is its sharp fangs; if you're careless, your neck could be taken off... just as I expected!

<b>

But while it's a troublesome opponent, it seems it doesn't have much stamina, so if you focus on defense for a while, it will tire out and slow down, making it the right time to hunt it.

Yet, since I caught it before it could slow down, I guess that's why the waves of astonishment are coming my way?

I thought I heard Aria mutter something about how it's only natural since we can catch Bread Beetles...

<b>

Looking at the one I grabbed by the scruff, I recalled the time I wandered alone in the forest last year.

Back then, I had zero survival skills and couldn't even dismantle something like this.

Even if I could dismantle it, they say magical beasts are too tainted with miasma to eat.

Ugh, I'm starting to remember the taste of that rotten meat from back then... If only I could have done "Magic Extraction" back then...

Huh? "Magic Extraction," huh...

<b>

"......How do you do 'Magic Extraction'?"

"Uh, 'Magic Extraction,' you say?"

<b>

I casually asked Anna Merry.

It seems Anna Merry can't do it.

Aria told me that it's Iltar's domain.

<b>

"Do you want to learn 'Magic Extraction,' young lady?"

"......If I can."

"'Magic Extraction' is a technique that washes away miasma with magical power. You could say it's a form of purification."

<b>

So, it seems that only those with a holy class and the attribute of nothingness can do this.

<b>

This technique was created out of necessity in the past when Amukam was poor and struggling to find food. It was developed to make use of the magical beasts we hunted.

<b>

"Magical power flows along with the blood. It's effective to do it together with bloodletting."

<b>

Under Iltar-san's guidance, we hung the Snuff Rabbit on a tree and she taught me how to perform "Magic Extraction" while dismantling it.

We drained the blood from the hung rabbit, flowing the magical power along with the extracted blood to wash away the miasma.

<b>

"Imagine filling every cell with magical power, slowly pushing out the impurities... Replacing the original miasma with your magical power."

<b>

If I poured in magical power all at once, it felt like the rabbit's body would break, so I had to do it slowly and carefully.

This is similar to the training I did during the trials, passing "Qi" through branches.

Since I had a decent understanding of how to delicately flow "Qi" or "magical power" into the target, I was able to do it surprisingly smoothly.

Iltar-san praised me for being surprisingly skilled for a first-timer!

Anna Merry seemed to be excited, saying, "As expected of you!!"

<b>

<b>

After finishing the "Magic Extraction," we decided to try tasting the rabbit meat, and Aria and the others prepared a simple stove by stacking stones.

Normally, rabbit meat isn't very tasty unless it's aged for a few days, but this time it's just a test to see if we can eat it.

For now, the meat itself doesn't have that unpleasant rotten smell unique to miasma.

Iltar-san also said it should be fine.

<b>

We lightly rubbed salt all over it, and although it wasn't for insurance, we used the basil we had to lightly season it.

When Anna Merry reached out to help, she was stopped by Millie-san, who held her back.

Yes, please keep holding her; it's dangerous!

<b>

We're roasting the rabbit, and as it cooks, a savory aroma begins to waft around.

Thinking back to when I roasted a magical beast before, I was already teary-eyed by this point, so I can say this is a success!

Because! It looks so appetizing!!

<b>

Once it was nicely roasted, I cut it up and let everyone taste it.

I hope the "Magic Extraction" was done well...

Having had the painful experience of eating miasma-tainted magical beast meat in the past, I can't help but worry about whether it was done right.

But everyone accepted it happily without showing any signs of reluctance.

<b>

First, as the one who performed the "Magic Extraction" and took responsibility for the cooking, I took the first bite.

..........Hmm, there's no off-flavor.

It's quite juicy, and the saltiness is just right. If I had to say, the umami is a bit lacking.

Well, it's not like we can age it to mature, so it can't be helped...

But it's definitely edible! I think this is a passing grade!

<b>

After I took a bite, Aria and the others all dug into the meat, exclaiming how delicious it was.

Millie-san praised, "The saltiness is just perfect!!!" and Keti-san was silently devouring the meat around the ribs.

Anna Merry was nodding and, as usual, biting into it while saying, "As expected of you!"

<b>

"Very few people can achieve such a clean 'Magic Extraction.' As expected of you, young lady."

<b>

Even though "Magic Extraction" leaves some miasma smell depending on the caster's skill, it is said to only serve as a substitute when food is truly scarce.

In modern times, when food isn't a problem, it seems no one goes to the trouble of eating magical beast meat by doing "Magic Extraction" unless they're on a long expedition to Iroshio.

<b>

"Of course, Suzy! Come marry me!"

<b>

Aria, sitting next to me, grabbed my shoulder tightly and pulled me close, peering into my face, and once again said something like that!

Ahhh! W-What?! How can you say such a manly line?! My cheeks are heating up!

Huh? For a moment, I felt like Anna Merry's glasses were gleaming ominously...?

<b>

"With your magical power infused so densely, it's like we're sharing your magical power."

<b>

Iltar-san said something like that.

<b>

"That means we're enjoying you deliciously! Ufufu♪"

<b>

With that mischievous remark from Iltar-san, the atmosphere in the room suddenly froze.

<b>

"Oh?" Ariya murmured, grinning as she looked into my eyes and took a bite of the rabbit meat.

Is Anna-Mary breathing heavily? What's wrong?

Millie is mumbling "Awa awa awa" while still taking small bites of the meat.

Keti is saying, "This... will sell!!" as she puts the meat away! Where on earth is she planning to sell it?!

Iltar, on the other hand, seems indifferent and is elegantly enjoying her meat with a smile...

<b>

What is this chaos?

<b>

Thank you for reading!!

<b>

I want to write stories like this throughout the year. 

That's my hope for the beginning of the year.
