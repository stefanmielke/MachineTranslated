# Interlude 3 - Without Magic

Happy New Year!

This is my first post of the year.

<blank>

An episode that I was going to include in episode 73 but decided against it.


----------------

<blank>

Team Aria was going to investigate a pig's nest they found during the recent rescue of Howard's dad, and I was asked to go with them.

Probably all the orcs in the nest were taken by the undead and turned into orc zombies, so there should be no threat to the nest, but they have to make sure there are no victims.

<blank>

<blank>

I am, however, willing to burn down the entire nest site if even a single one of them survives! Huffing and puffing!

I was so excited that I was so surprised that I could not believe my eyes! Don't do anything unnecessary, okay?　She repeatedly reminded me not to do anything unnecessary.

<blank>

I understand! I wouldn't do such disorderly destructive activities either!

When I said I was fine, Aria and Iltar seemed to look at me with some stony eyes, but I'm sure it was just my imagination!

<blank>

<blank>

And this time, for some reason, AnnaMarie is with us.

AnnaMarie said, "Wherever I go, it is my duty to be with you! she says.

Well, I knew what AnnaMarie was capable of the last time around, so I'm not worried about accompanying her.

<blank>

When we left, Mia tried to come with us, but there was no way she would get permission, and everyone was holding her back.

I think that was Dana's at that time, it was not a hold, it was a grasp!

Let me dare to say it: ....... That's mine! WOW!

<blank>

But when Mia, who was being held, and AnnaMarie's gaze met in the hollow, I thought I saw sparks, but why?

Mia's frustrated voice afterwards and AnnaMarie's innocent smile in contrast made a deep impression. ...... What on earth happened between them? It's a mystery!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, it's not like I'm going on a long trip!

Since we are only going to investigate one place and come back, it is like a short trip to spend one or two nights in the area at the most.

It's "Team Aria" with a team rank of "A", for the most part, you know? And Aria's own grade will go up to A next month!

There's nothing to worry about!

<blank>

The location is approximately 25-6 km from the village.

Last time, the distance was ridden through all at once on horseback, but this time it will be on foot.

It took a large group of knights many days to get there, but it would not take more than a day on foot for the people of Amkham, who know the forest inside out.

And even though it's a heavily encroached forest, the path is well made by the Knights' round trip.

There were a fair number of magical beasts along the way, but Team Aria slaughtered them without a hitch.

<blank>

<blank>

And Sole showed up shortly before we arrived at our destination.

Well, I knew the signs!

It was hard to believe that this side would fall behind, and above all, Aria was the first to notice and take a stance in front of him.

<blank>

Ooooooh!"

<blank>

At that moment, Aria let out a moan as if squeezed from the back of her throat, and a gurgle sound, as if she had struck a copper wire, echoed through the area, and her body shook as if she had caught a shell with two battle axes stacked in front of her.

<blank>

The white mass, which Aria deflected a direct hit as she stopped, was bounced into the trees and disappeared.

<blank>

Watch out! It's a snuff-rabbit!"

<blank>

All of them braced themselves on the spot at Aria's shout.

Ms. Irta casts a spell, deploys a magic shield, and grows plants with the spirit invoked by Ms. Ketty to block the path of the snuff-rabbit.

Rabbit, however, uses his natural quickness to evade obstacles and leapfrog everyone on the team.

<blank>

Hmmm. I didn't feel so threatened when I encountered it before.

Aria and the others seem to be feeling pretty impatient?

Well, it is true that if this guy were to take a critical hit, you would feel a sense of dread that your head would be blown off in an instant.

<blank>

And that white ball of fur furiously snatches Mr. Ketty's obstacle, avoids AnnaMarie's wire warding, and comes straight at Aria and her friends, piercing their blind spot!

<blank>

Miss?

<blank>

AnnaMarie raised her voice as she caught a white devil-like fellow running through the space in her field of vision, dodging through the encirclement of Team Rank A.

Yes, he came at me.

<blank>

The distance was 10 meters, but he kicked the ground and closed the distance in an instant.

A white furball approached me with a booming sound like a bombardment! And I am ................

<blank>

<blank>

I grabbed Munz and that guy by the neck.

<blank>

I made a funny sound like I was being crushed!　I wonder if it was because the momentum of my flight pulled the skin of my neck and tightened my throat.

I put a pin in his forehead and quickly put an end to his fussing.

These dangerous creatures need to be exterminated as soon as possible, or they'll be in danger! Duh!

<blank>

"Oh, you grabbed that thing, ......?"

'Oh, lady, you're seeing that thing: ......'

"One fingertip stops ......?"

"...... astonished"

It's a quintessence, Miss! It's sasuga!"

<blank>

I feel like I'm being half-hearted, but let's leave it at that. ......

After all, this guy seems to be one of the most troublesome magical beasts around.

It does not have high combat power itself, but it is just so quick that it is difficult to catch.

The blow is heavy, but nothing the group can't withstand if they can get to this area.

Be wary of its sharp fangs, it can hunt you down by the neck if you're not careful. ...... I was right, he was just as I thought he would be!

<blank>

If they stay on the defensive for a while, they will run out of stamina and slow down their movements, so the theory is to hunt them.

But since I caught it before it slowed down, is there a wave of dismay in the air?

I thought I heard Aria muttering, "Of course you can catch a Bread Beetle." ......

<blank>

Seeing him holding her by the neck reminded me of the time when I was wandering alone in the forest last year.

I had zero survival skills at the time and couldn't even dismantle something like this!

Even if we could dismantle the beast, we are told that it smells of miasma and is inedible.

Aww, I'm going to remember the taste of that rotten meat again. ......, ugh, it would have been different if they had at least been able to "remove the evil spirits". ......

Hmm? The "Without Magic" or .......

<blank>

"......How do you do 'demon extraction'?"

"Well, is it without magic?"

<blank>

I asked AnnaMarie.

Apparently, AnnaMarie can't do it.

That's the territory of Irta, Aria told me.

<blank>

"Miss, do you want to learn to 'magic-remove'?"

"I can do ......, then."

The "magic extraction" is a technique to wash away the miasma with magic power. In other words, it is a form of purification.

<blank>

Therefore, this can only be done by those who have the attribute of nothingness, which is a holy position.

<blank>

This was a long time ago, when Amkam was still poor and had no food to eat. He said that this technology was created out of necessity, in order to somehow turn the hunted magical beasts into food.

<blank>

The magic flows in and out of the bloodstream. It works best when done in conjunction with bloodletting."

<blank>

With the guidance of Mr. Irta, we hung the snuff-rabbit from a tree and learned how to remove the demon while dismantling it.

The hanging rabbits are drained of blood, and the magic power is poured through them along with the blood that is drained to wash away the miasma.

<blank>

"Imagine slowly pushing out the dirt that is present so that the magic power fills all of your cells. ...... Replace the original miasma with your daughter's magic."

<blank>

If you pour in the magic power all at once, it seems as if the Rabbit's body itself will break down, so you do it as slowly and carefully as possible.

This may be similar to the way to pass Ki through a branch, which we were training for during the ordeal.

Since I knew how to delicately pour ki and magic power into the object, the process went surprisingly smoothly.

Even Irta was so skillful that I couldn't believe it was her first time. I was praised by her!

AnnaMarie is quintessential!　And for some reason, she is excited.

<blank>

<blank>

Aria and her team prepared a simple stove made of piled up stones for us to taste the meat of the Rabbit, which had been de-evilized.

With regular rabbit meat, you have to let it sit for a few days before it tastes that good, but this time it's a test to see if it's edible.

At any rate, the meat itself does not have that unpleasant rotten smell characteristic of the miasma.

Iltad-san also told me that this would be fine.

<blank>

I lightly rubbed the entire dish with salt and, not as an insurance policy, I also used some basil I had on hand to add a light aroma.

When AnnaMarie reached out to help, Millie grabbed her by the wings and stopped her.

Unh, please keep it down, it's dangerous!

<blank>

Rabbits are roasted whole, and as they are cooked, a fragrant aroma begins to waft around the area.

Considering that the last time I burned a magical beast, I was already in tears at this point, I guess this can be called a success, right?

Because! It's so appetizing!

<blank>

When it was baked well, I asked everyone to cut it into pieces and taste it.

I hope I've been able to 'magic out' properly and successfully. ......

As someone who once had the painful experience of eating a miasma-smelling hexenbiest meat, I can't help but worry if it wasn't well done.

But everyone showed no sign of displeasure and happily accepted the gift.

<blank>

First of all, as the person who did the "demon-removal" and was responsible for the cooking, I took the first bite myself.

............ Yeah, no smell.

It is juicy in its own way, and the saltiness is excellent. If I may say so, the flavor is a little lacking.

Well, I can't help it, because I can't let it sleep and age. ......

But it is edible enough! Is this an acceptable score?

<blank>

After I took a bite, all the arias were biting into the meat and enjoying it.

Millie-san praises me for the perfect amount of salt!　and Ketty is also sucking on the meat around the abdomen without saying a word.

AnnaMarie nodded, as she always does, and quipped, "Quintessence, sir.　and biting into it.

<blank>

I've never seen anyone who can do it so beautifully," he said. You're a master, young lady."

<blank>

Even if the magic is removed, the smell of the noxious gas remains, depending on the skill of the magician, so it can only be used as a substitute when there is really no food.

In this day and age, when there is no shortage of food, no one is forced to eat hexenbiest meat, except on long expeditions to Ilocio.

<blank>

I knew it, Susie! Come marry me!"

<blank>

Aria, sitting next to me, grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me into a hug!

Ahn! What? That's such a manly line! I can't help but feel my cheeks heat up!

Hmm? For a moment now, I thought I saw a swarthy glow from AnnaMarie's glasses. ......?

<blank>

When it's this dense with the young lady's magic, it's almost as if she's sharing her magic with us.

<blank>

Mr. Irta said something like that.

<blank>

"I'm eating your daughter up, that's what I'm saying! Mmmm..."

<blank>

The air in the room froze for some reason when Irta mischievously said this line.

<blank>

Huh? Aria looks me in the eye, grins, raises her mouth and bites into the rabbit meat.

Is AnnaMarie breathing hard? What is it? What's wrong?

Millie is still taking small bites of meat while saying, "Awww, awww, awww.

Mr. Ketty said, this will sell ......!　And then he put the meat away! Where on earth are you going to sell it!!!!

Mr. Irta is smiling and eating meat elegantly, as if he has no interest in us. ......

<blank>

What is it? This chaos.

Thank you for reading!

I hope to write stories like this one this year.

The beginning of the year I think.
