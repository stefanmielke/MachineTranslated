# 111 The Big Vestibule

I said, "That's why! I'm telling you what this is all about! Karen! Hey, hey, hey!

"At ......, so, that's..."

I told you it was your fault, didn't I? You're the one who said it's your fault! Are you crazy?

"So it's ...... impossible for such a thing to enter .........

I'm not going to let you do this to me! Karen! Aaahhh!

<blank>

What the hell is this guy?

Why are you making accusations against Karen by name?

<blank>

"I know Karen locally and she told me to call her, so I brought her here. ......

<blank>

It's not quite the right mood," senior Elise Schardt said, raising an eyebrow.

At the table is a couple who look like they are flirtatious.

Are they people? They seem to be fundamentally different from our clientele.

<blank>

The guy is a bad looking guy, with a lot of piercings in his ears and nose, as if he was trying to show off. What's with the nose ring? Is it a nose ring? Is he a cow?

The woman is also not very flattering. Their breasts are wide open and their makeup is heavy. Is she a gal? Is her pompous head like a cabaret girl? Were there gals in this world?

<blank>

The man shouts menacingly and the woman looks at Karen, who is shriveling up, with a smirk on her face and a disgusted smile on her face.

I don't like ...... anyhow.

<blank>

Why, Karen, are you being so wishy-washy with that guy?"

<blank>

It's true, Mia is right.

Karen is not the kind of girl who would be easily intimidated by people of that caliber.

That is evident in this morning's case.

The three of us this morning wore a much more dangerous vibe than the juniors there.

<blank>

She said she found a hair in the chiffon cake. And that it belonged to Karen."

<blank>

Huh? What are they talking about? There's no way that's in there! And it wasn't Karen who served it, by the way! That's just a false accusation!

The senior Alpha Moonves' explanation made a petit-bitty sound in my head.

As I was about to step forward with Yulali, Bibi put his hand on my shoulder and stopped me.

<blank>

Let's leave it to Mr. Alma."

<blank>

I looked, and before I knew it, Alma was in front of me, urging Karen to move back.

<blank>

Excuse me. I am the hall manager in charge of this area.



I heard you wanted to see me. How can I help you?"

<blank>

Mr. Alma looks at us while talking to the man and instructs us with his eyes to move Karen back.

I nodded and put my hand on Karen's shoulder, gently guiding her back.

<blank>

Oh, hey! Wait, Karen! What the hell are you doing backing out on your own?

<blank>

The man tried to call out to Karen as she stepped back, but I quickly hid her behind me and left her in the care of Ellis-senpai.

<blank>

Senior Ellis immediately takes Karen to the staff room and hides her completely from the man's eyes. When Alma confirmed this, she nodded with a small smile.

Then he quickly raises his right hand to the level of his face and snaps his fingers once.

<blank>

Oh? That's great. The magic unfolded in an instant.

As I recall, this is a field magic "sound absorbing wall" with a wind attribute that keeps sound from leaking out.

<blank>

AnnaMarie uses it in her room when she gives me oil massages.

When I inevitably get that massage, I end up speaking ...... more than I should! No, it's nothing, nothing!

<blank>

I mean, Alma's magic is much faster to deploy than what AnnaMarie uses. The magic density is also quite high. ...... great Alma.

<blank>

Now, an invisible sound-absorbing wall, which prevents sound from leaking out, surrounds the table with men and women, including Alma, from behind me.

No matter how much these guys yell, no sound leaks out to the surroundings.

<blank>

What the hell did you think you were doing? What the hell did you mean to pull Karen back? Aah!

What do you mean? is a line from our side of the table.

What the hell?

You seem to be making unjustified accusations about our products. ......

It's not an accusation! Look closely! There's a hair in there like this!

You think this belongs to one of our employees?

I told you so! How are you going to pay for this? Aah!

You also mentioned that this hair belonged to a certain lady's maid?"

Oh." That's Karen's! That's Karen's! It's Karen's hair! Heh heh! So, it makes sense to let her pay for it, right? Yeah?

"Well, that's not very plausible either. How could her hair get mixed in here?"

"Aah? I'm not going to say it! That's Karen's! I've been telling you for a while now that those are Karen's!

Can you tell us why, what is your rationale?"

He's a fucking idiot! Hey! We testified to that! Testimony!

How much evidence do you have to support your testimony? I say, "How much evidence do you have for your testimony?

You son of a bitch! You say you can't trust what your customers say? Aah?

Hey, you! We are your customers! Do you understand that? Do you understand?

Are you ......?"

<blank>

Alma-san put her hand over her mouth and let out a small giggle, and the color of the DQN couple's eyes blatantly changed.

<blank>

You! What the hell are you doing?

What are you laughing at? What the hell are you doing?

We call our customers those who have purchased our products and services for a satisfactory price.

What the hell are you talking about? What the hell are you talking about?

We don't call extortionists 'customers.

"Hey, man! You think we're playing hooky?

"Oh? Are you aware of that?"

I said, "......, you'd better get a grip. You'll get away with it if you keep licking my lips."

Now, what exactly do you mean by 'freebies'? Can you tell us exactly what you mean?"

<blank>

She puts her index finger on her chin, tilts her head and listens cutely, but ......, Alma, that's a lot of agitation, isn't it?

<blank>

That's why! I told you I can't get away with this!

I can't help it. Your statements are so abstract that I can't see anything concrete in them.

And to the store! And to the employees! ...... things can go wrong. ...... I'm telling you that."

<blank>

Oh, they are coming to me with threatening words.

Alma raised her eyebrows and put her hand over her mouth, looking distressed ......, but I saw a small twitch at the corner of her mouth?

<blank>

I'm having trouble with ......."

"Ha! If you get it, just listen to me ......"

'As usual, your statements lack specificity. Are you, by any chance, the kind of person who doesn't understand language? Are you the kind of person who doesn't understand language?"

Huh?

<blank>

Bwah!

<blank>

Oh, no, no, no. Alma's agitation almost made me burst out laughing.

Normal, normal. I am a cool waitress.

<blank>

You son of a bitch! I'm not going to let you get away with this anymore! Are you ready for this? Aaah!

<blank>

The man shouted at him and kicked the table, glaring at Mr. Alma as if he were intimidating him.

But our table is a thick one made of heavy rosewood.

It is not something that can be dealt with by a kick that is not even in the body of a person in the neighborhood.

After all, that's a lot of weight!

With the kick you just made, you made a little bit of noise, but a little bit of shaking? It was just a little bit of a jolt. That was more painful for the leg that kicked.

<blank>

Now, as I have been saying, what are you going to do? I would like to know what you intend to do.

Don't think you can do business with a store that offers products containing this kind of thing! I'm going to go out there and testify! I'm going to testify!

<blank>

I see. So you want to find out who owns this hair? If we can find out who the hair belongs to, we can find out who tried to discredit the product! I see... I see!

Oh, what? Oh, ......."

Let's go to the guardhouse and find out what really happened!"

Guard? Wait! Wait a minute! We're not ......"

<blank>

If the Guard Corps applies, a priest of the High Priest class will be dispatched from the Temple Authority immediately. If that person uses the "healing of regeneration," the hair will immediately return to its original body! It is clear and obvious whose body the hair came from, isn't it?

No, no, not that far. ......

Oh! It's okay, okay? If you use the "Regenerative Healing" on a regular Temple Authority High Priest, you'll need two or three medium gold coins at a time. ......"

"......!!!!"

We have some of the best students of Milia Castel Eye and candidates for saints in our store. We have excellent students and prospective saints from Milia Castel Eye. Above all, it will save you a lot of time!

<blank>

You don't call it saving money - Alma.

I feel like they are getting really pale.

Well, that's because the average person would freak out if they were told that they need two or three medium gold coins at 5a each.

That's 10,000-15,000c for a Kupru conversion! That's a different order of magnitude to handle!

We, the general public, don't have many opportunities to do business in the Alu.

<blank>

I don't think I'd go that far ......, say, no ......."

Oh, then what were you going to do?"

"............ chit!!!"

<blank>

Let's go home! Kuso!

"Oh? What about your hair?"

I don't know!"

I see. ....... Well, thank you very much. Your bill will be 310c."

What?

Please make your payment."

You son of a bitch! You put this stuff out there and now you want to take my money?

I haven't even put my mouth on it yet! I haven't even put my mouth on it yet!"

<blank>

Well, it's usually expensive, our store is.

A cup of tea 110c

A cut cake is 90c.

<blank>

A cup of coffee at a regular caf√© costs 40 cents, so our tea is more than double that.

Even this cake costs 480c if you buy it whole.

That's a ridiculous price for a daily wage of 250-280c for a day laborer!

It's really far removed from the way ordinary people like us feel. I understand how you feel.

<blank>

But, however! It was you who made such an expensive cake into such a thing.

You will be paid in full.

<blank>

Fuck you." Fuck! Get the fuck out of the way!

<blank>

The senior rose wildly from his seat, advanced toward me, and came swinging out his clenched right fist.

Well, it's not really a punch, it's more like a fist hammer, right? The one where you hit the little finger side of the clenched fist?

And then he swung his arm around, aiming at the tip of my shoulder, as if to shake me off. And he swung his arm around, aiming at the tip of my shoulder, as if to shake me off.

<blank>

The reason why he is doing this to me is because ...... I am standing in the middle of the aisle, blocking his way!

The only thing that stands out is the quiet and neat appearance of the building.

<blank>

That's why Alma left me here and used the sound-absorbing wall on me, to keep these people from escaping!

Alma, you're amazing! You're so thorough! She's the sister everyone can count on!

<blank>

This guy ...... is a pretty bad guy. He's really trying to hit the girl with his fist.

I think it would be pretty bad if it hit a normal girl or something.

Well, it doesn't hit me. I am very slow. Any Amcam girl can handle it.

<blank>

I swept my left hand up to my right side and caught the fist of the person approaching my shoulder with just my left finger.

Specifically, it's the index finger, middle finger, and thumb.

He wrapped his three fingers with friendly fingers, and gently cushioned them with cotton, using the joints of his fingers and wrists as well.

Otherwise, it would be scary to see fists shattering, fingers sticking into fists, and other splattering disasters spreading! Really!

<blank>

A pitter-patter! The fist stopped, and the seniors were surprised to see their eyes widen.

<blank>

If you refuse to pay and leave the restaurant, you will be charged with eating and drinking without paying.

I'm not kidding! You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

Alma's chilling voice is thrown at the backs of the seniors.

As he tried to yell back at Alma, I moved my fingertips on his fist slightly. My fingertip went through his wrist, elbow, and shoulder all at once.

The senior, sounding surprised, finally fell to his knees.

I don't think this guy has any idea what he's getting himself into. He just looks up at me with a surprised look on his face.

<blank>

I told you that we have a lot of excellent children from Milia Castel Eye. Naturally, they are all excellent not only in magic, but also in martial arts. Of course, it is not only the students of Milia, but other children are also very talented. They all have the ability to protect customers from thugs. If you think you can get by by yelling and screaming, I suggest you change your mind.

<blank>

That's right. All the waitresses at our restaurant are not just ordinary people.

I don't have to tell you that the members of Amkam are the best in the school, but I heard from Colin that senior members of the school, such as senior members of Ellis and Alpha, are the most talented in the school. (Colin's information). Even Mr. Selkie and Mr. Merle are more powerful than any of the rag-tag gangsters around here. The fact that Merle called Karen a "monster" is not surprising, as we saw in this morning's incident. ......

<blank>

That's right! All the waitresses here are "fighting waitresses! Generally speaking, they are told on their first day of work that they can "beat out any customer who comes in to cause trouble"!

<blank>

Alma continues to talk in a chilling tone with a quiet smile, "The girls are enough to deal with the outlaws who sometimes come to our house.

You can tell from the smile on her face that Alma, who is in charge of this "fighting waitress," is no ordinary person, yes?

<blank>

Eating and drinking without paying is a fine crime, so I'm going to report you to the Guard at this point, okay?"

I'm sure she'll pay for it! She's the one with the hair in her head!

If you really want to clarify where the blame lies, that's fine with us. If you insist on clarifying where the responsibility lies, that is fine with us.

<blank>

The girl who looks like a cabaret girl still tries to rub it in Karen's face. This guy ...... irritates even the mild-mannered me a little.

Originally, our restaurant is supposed to take cash when we bring your order.

But these guys want me to get Karen out when the item arrives. They said, "We know each other, so it's a good opportunity to see each other and pay Karen. They said that they knew her and they wanted to pay her face to face.

That's outrageous! From the very beginning, they must have wanted Karen to have the money to pay for it!

<blank>

But Alma coldly dismisses such remarks.

<blank>

Yes." Kare ...... Ngii! ...... ngiiiii!"

<blank>

Even more so, I put pressure on the fingertips that were touching just a little bit, because even my junior was about to rant and rave about making Karen pay. You shut up!

Then I kind of moaned louder than I thought I would. Was that too much pressure? Too much pressure? It's difficult to apply too much pressure. ......

Then, when I looked down at him, as soon as his eyes met mine, he started to jerk! And he started sweating and looking pale? Oh no, is something wrong with her?

<blank>

I said, "Okay, I get it. I'll pay you! I'll pay you, just let him go!"

<blank>

The cabaret girl then slammed two large silver coins on the table as if in a panic.

When Alma confirmed this, she turned to me and nodded.

I gave them a small nod in return, and quickly stepped away from them to make way for them.

<blank>

One moment, please.

What? You still have something? You paid for it!

<blank>

When Alma-san called out to Cavanaugh, who was helping her junior up, Cavanaugh raised his voice as if he was biting her.

<blank>

Here is your change. Please make sure you have it."

<blank>

Alma-san took the cabaret girl's hand and gently placed the silver and copper coins in change on her hand.

Alma then straightened her posture, kept her back straight, and bowed deeply to the DQN couple.

<blank>

When you come to visit us again, we will serve you with the utmost sincerity.

<blank>

The cabaret girl who heard Alma's words widened her eyes as if she was truly surprised, and then said, "Don't come here again! She then said, "I'll never come back!" and walked out of the store as if dragging her senpai along with her.

<blank>

Well, well, well...they were a very peculiar bunch, weren't they? There really are people like this, aren't there?

Alma once told me, "They spring up once in a while, but when they do, just smash them and wear them out..." or something light like that, as if G would handle it.

Well, there is absolutely no need to show mercy to people who come to other people's stores and say whatever they want!

<blank>

Sue, you were great!

Hagyu?

The silent 'pressure' was great! Your work exceeded my expectations!

"Oh, um..! Ah, Mr. Alma?"

She's such a strong, pretty, and talented girl! I'm going to get out of control, sis! Mmmmmm!

I'm sorry, I can't hear you! A, Alma-san? Alma-san! Why the hug? Why are you so rustly?

'Hmmm, I haven't solved the field magic yet, so a little reward in this one?

"What's your prize, Nanny?

<blank>

Almaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Don't touch Sue-chan!

<blank>

Suddenly, Alma hugged me and was about to do something to me when Mia's voice echoed around the area.

WOW! Field magic flew? Anti-Magic?

<blank>

"Whoooa? Mia? Why? I thought you were having some cognitive dissonance!

My Sue-chan sensor! That's not enough to alienate me!

This girl doesn't make any sense!

<blank>

I don't know what it is, but it's suddenly chaotic!
