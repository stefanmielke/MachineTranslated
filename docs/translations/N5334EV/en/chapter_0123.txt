# Chapter 111: The Large Front Yard

"That's why! What the hell is going on?! Karen!! Hey?!"

"…W-well, that's because…"

"I'm saying it's your screw-up, isn't it?! Huh?! Is it not?!!"

"That's why… s-such a thing shouldn't be… a-possible…"

"Enough already! Karen!! Aaaah?!!"

<b>

What the hell is this guy?

Why is he specifically targeting Karen?

<b>

"I brought her because I was told to call her since she's a local acquaintance of Karen…"

<b>

"It's not really the right atmosphere, is it?" said Senior Eris Shard, furrowing her brow.

The couple sitting at the table looks like a bunch of delinquents.

Are they thugs? They seem fundamentally different from the type of customers we usually have.

<b>

The man looks rough around the edges, sporting a lot of piercings on his ears and nose. What’s with that nose piercing? A ring? Is he a bull?

The woman isn’t exactly refined either. Her cleavage is prominently displayed, and her makeup is heavy. Is she a gal? Does her styled hair look like a hostess? Are there gals in this world too?!

<b>

The man is shouting aggressively, while the woman is leering at a shrinking Karen with a nasty grin.

…This is really annoying.

<b>

"Why is Karen acting so timid in front of those guys?"

<b>

That's really true, just like Mia said.

Karen is not the type to easily cower just because those kinds of people are intimidating her.

You can tell that from what happened this morning.

The three from this morning had a much more dangerous vibe than those thugs.

<b>

"They say there was a hair in the chiffon cake. And that it belongs to Karen."

<b>

Huh?! What are these guys talking about?! There's no way something like that could be in there! Besides, Karen wasn't the one serving it, right?! That's just a baseless accusation!!

The explanation from Senior Alpha Moonbes made my head feel like it was popping.

As I tried to step forward, Bibi placed a hand on my shoulder to stop me.

<b>

"Let's leave it to Alma-san."

<b>

Looking over, I noticed Alma-san had stepped forward and was urging Karen to step back.

<b>

"Excuse me. I am the hall manager in charge here."

"Ahhh?!!"

"I heard you have a complaint. What seems to be the problem?"

<b>

Alma-san sent a glance towards the man while talking to him, signaling with her eyes for Karen to step back.

I nodded, placed a hand on Karen's shoulder, and gently guided her back.

<b>

"Hey! Wait, Karen! What the hell do you think you're doing trying to back out?!!"

<b>

As Karen stepped back, the man raised his voice to call her, but I quickly hid Karen behind me and handed her over to Senior Eris.

<b>

Senior Eris immediately took Karen to the staff room, completely hiding her from the man's view. Alma-san smiled slightly and nodded in confirmation.

Then, she raised her right hand to face level and snapped her fingers once.

<b>

Oh? Amazing. The magic was deployed in an instant.

This is the soundproof field magic "Sound Absorbing Wall," right?

It's the one Anna Mary uses when she gives me an oil massage in the room.

When I get that massage, I tend to make more noise than necessary… Ahem! No, it's nothing, really!

<b>

By the way, Alma-san's magic is deployed much faster than what Anna Mary uses. The magic density is also quite high… Amazing, Alma-san.

<b>

Now, an invisible wall of sound absorption is surrounding the table with both men and women, including Alma-san, from behind me.

No matter how much these guys shout, not a single sound will leak out to the surroundings.

<b>

"Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing pulling Karen back?! Huh?!!"

"What do you mean by that? That's our line."

"What did you say?!!"

"Please refrain from making baseless accusations against our products…"

"That's not an accusation! Look closely! There's hair in it!!"

"Are you saying that this hair belongs to one of our employees?"

"That's what I've been saying! How are you going to take responsibility for this?! Huh?!!"

"You seem to be claiming that this hair belongs to a specific waitress, correct?"

"Yeah! That's right! It's Karen's! It's her hair!! Hehe! So, it's only right for her to take responsibility, right?! Huh?!"

"Ah, that seems to lack any basis. How did her hair come to be mixed in here?"

"Huh? I-I told you! It's Karen's hair, I've been saying that since earlier!!"

"Could you please provide the reason for that claim?"

"You're a real idiot! Hey! We're testifying that it is! Testifying!!"

"I'm asking how much basis there is for that testimony."

"Are you saying you can't trust what the customers say?! Huh?!!!"

"Excuse me! We are customers, you know?! Do you understand? Hey?!"

"Customers… you say?"

<b>

Alma-san placed her hand on her mouth and let out a small chuckle, causing the DQN couple's eyes to visibly change.

<b>

"What do you mean by that?!!"

"What are you laughing at?! Don't mess with me?!!"

"We refer to those who purchase our products and services with a satisfactory exchange as 'customers.'"

"Huh?! What kind of nonsense is that?!"

"We do not refer to those who attempt to extort as 'customers.'"

"Are you saying we're lying?!"

"Oh? Are you aware of that?"

"…Enough already? If you keep underestimating us, you won't get away with it."

"Now, what do you mean by 'not getting away with it'? Could you please enlighten me on what exactly that entails?"

<b>

With her index finger on her chin, she tilted her head cutely while asking, but… Alma-san, you're really provoking them, aren't you?

<b>

"That's why! I'm saying it won't end without consequences!!"

"That seems unacceptable. Your statements have been abstract, lacking any specificity."

"Something bad might happen to the store! To the employees! …I'm saying that."

<b>

Oh, the thug is throwing out threats now.

Alma-san furrowed her brow and placed her hand on her mouth, looking as if she was pondering… but the corners of her mouth twitched slightly, didn't they?

<b>

"…This is troubling."

"Hah! If you understand, then you should listen to what we have to say…"

"Your statements continue to lack specificity. Could it be that you are unable to comprehend language?"

"What?!!"

<b>

Bwah!

<b>

Oh no, I almost burst out laughing at Alma-san's provocation.

Calm down, calm down. I am a cool waitress.

<b>

"You're not getting away with this! Are you ready for the consequences?! Aaaah?!!"

<b>

As the man shouted angrily, he glared at Alma-san and kicked the table as if to intimidate her.

However, our table is made of thick, heavy rosewood.

It's not something that can be easily moved by a weak kick from some thug.

After all, it’s quite heavy.

The kick made a bit of noise and caused a slight shake, but that’s all. The foot that kicked it is probably the one that’s hurting.

<b>

"Now, as I mentioned earlier, what are you planning to do? Please tell me."

"Don't think a store that serves products with something like this can continue to operate! We'll take this to the authorities! I'll testify!!"

<b>

"I see, so you intend to identify the owner of this hair? If we can determine whose hair it is, we can also identify who tried to undermine the product's credibility!"

"Uh, yeah…"

"We'll head straight to the guards' station to clarify the truth of the matter!"

"Guards?! Wait! We don't want to do that…"

<b>

"If there is a request from the guards, a high priest-level priest from the temple should come immediately. If they use 'Restorative Healing,' the hair will return to its original body instantly! It will be clear as day whose body it came from, right?!"

"N-no, we didn't mean to go that far…"

"Oh, don't worry! Normally, having a high priest from the temple use 'Restorative Healing' would cost about 2 to 3 gold coins per use…"

"…!!!"

"Our store has excellent students from the Miria Castle Eye, including candidates for saintesses. It would be best to ask them. Above all, it would save time!"

<b>

Alma-san didn’t mention saving money, did she?

The expressions on the couple's faces seem to have turned extremely pale.

Well, if you tell a commoner that you need 2 to 3 gold coins, each worth 5 a, they would definitely be shocked.

That’s 10,000 to 15,000 c in Kupuru conversion! The scale of the transaction is completely different!

Besides, ordinary people like us rarely have the opportunity to engage in transactions at Owl.

<b>

"W-wait, we didn't mean to go that far…"

"Oh? Then what were you planning to do?"

"…Tch!!"

<b>

"We're leaving!! Damn it!!"

"Oh? What about the hair?"

"I don't care about that!!"

"I see… Then, thank you very much. Your total is 310 c."

"What?!!"

"Please make your payment."

"Are you serious?! You’re charging us for this?!"

"Yes! We haven't even touched it yet!!"

<b>

Well, our store is quite pricey.

A cup of tea is 110 c.

A slice of cake is 90 c.

<b>

In a regular café, a cup of coffee costs about 40 c, so our tea is more than double that.

This cake costs 480 c if you buy it whole.

Considering that a day laborer's daily wage is around 250 to 280 c, that’s an outrageous price!

It’s really far removed from the sensibilities of commoners like us. I understand their feelings, I really do.

<b>

However! It was you guys who turned such an expensive cake into this.

You will pay up properly.

<b>

"Get lost! Damn it!!"

<b>

As the thug stood up roughly and approached me, he swung his right fist at me.

Well, it wasn't exactly a punch, but more like a hammer fist? The kind where you hit with the side of your fist?

He swung his arm as if to brush me aside, aiming for my shoulder.

<b>

The reason he’s doing this to me is… because I’m blocking his way by standing in the middle of the aisle!

Well, I’m standing quietly and gracefully, at least.

<b>

Alma-san left me here and used the "Sound Absorbing Wall" to prevent these thugs from escaping!

Alma-san is amazing! She’s thorough! As expected of the reliable big sister everyone looks up to!!

<b>

But still, this guy… is really terrible. He’s seriously trying to hit a girl.

If this were to hit a normal girl, it would probably result in something pretty awful.

Well, it won’t hit me. His movements are really slow. Anyone from Amukamu could handle it.

<b>

I smoothly raised my left hand to my right side and perfectly caught the thug’s fist with just my left fingers.

Specifically, it was my index finger, middle finger, and thumb.

I wrapped those three fingers in a friendly finger momentarily and gently cushioned the impact, using the joints of my fingers and wrist flexibly to absorb it like a cushion.

If I didn’t do that, his fist would break, or his fingers would stab into his own fist, creating a splatter of carnage! That’s really scary!!

<b>

The fist came to a halt, and the thug’s eyes widened in surprise.

<b>

"If you refuse to pay and leave, it will be considered dining and dashing."

"Huh?! Are you kidding…?!!"

<b>

Alma-san's cold voice was thrown at the thug's back.

As the thug tried to yell back at Alma-san, I slightly moved my fingertips still touching his fist. My fingertips locked onto his wrist, then quickly moved up to his elbow and shoulder, bending them in reverse.

The thug let out a surprised sound and ended up kneeling.

He probably doesn’t even understand what’s happening to him. He’s just looking up at me with a surprised expression.

<b>

"I mentioned that our store has many excellent students from Miria Castle Eye. They are all skilled not only in magic but also in combat. Of course, it’s not just the Miria students; others are also very capable. They all have the ability to protect customers from thugs. If you think shouting loudly will somehow help, I suggest you reconsider."

<b>

That’s right. All the waitresses at our store are not ordinary.

I don’t need to mention the members of Amukamu, but even seniors like Eris and Alpha are said to be among the top in the academy (according to Colin). Selkie and Meruru also have enough skill to not be easily dealt with by those thugs. And Karen, who was called a "monster" by Meruru, is also quite capable, as seen from this morning's incident…

<b>

Yes! All the waitresses here are "fighting waitresses"! In fact, I was told on my first day that if a customer causes trouble, I can kick them out!

<b>

Alma-san, with a calm smile, continues to speak in a chilly tone, saying that even the lawbreakers who occasionally come to our store can be dealt with by the girls alone.

It’s clear from this smile that Alma-san, who manages these "fighting waitresses," is definitely not an ordinary person.

<b>

"Dining and dashing is a serious crime, so I will report this to the guards."

"Why not just make Karen pay for it?! I-it was her hair that was in there!!"

"Are you still insisting on going to the guards' station to file a complaint? If you really want to clarify where the responsibility lies, we don’t mind."

<b>

The girl who looks like a hostess is still trying to pin this on Karen. This girl… even I, who am usually mild-mannered, am starting to get a bit irritated.

Our store usually requires payment when the ordered items are brought to the table.

But these guys were saying they wanted to see Karen when the items arrived because they were acquaintances. They were clearly planning to make Karen pay from the start!

<b>

However, Alma-san coldly dismisses such statements.

<b>

"That's right! K-Karen… g-gah! …Ugh!"

<b>

As the thug was about to say something else, I applied a bit of pressure with the fingertips I was still touching him with. You should be quiet!

Then he let out a surprisingly loud groan. Wait, did I apply too much pressure? It’s hard to control my strength…

When I lowered my gaze, he flinched as soon as our eyes met, starting to sweat profusely and looking pale? Oh no, did he suddenly feel unwell?

<b>

"I-I get it! I get it! I’ll pay, so let me go!"

<b>

Saying that, the hostess hurriedly slammed two large silver coins onto the table.

Alma-san checked it and nodded at me.

I also nodded back slightly, moved away from the thug, and opened the way for them.

<b>

"Please wait a moment."

"W-what now?! Is there something else?! We paid, didn’t we?!"

<b>

As Alma-san called out to the hostess who was helping the thug up, she snapped back angrily.

<b>

"This is your change. Please check it."

<b>

Alma-san took the hostess's hand and gently placed the change of silver and copper coins on top of her hand.

Then, Alma-san straightened her posture and bowed deeply to the DQN couple.

<b>

"When you come again, may the elegance and nobility reside in your hearts, and we will serve you with all our sincerity."

<b>

After hearing Alma-san's words, the hostess opened her eyes wide in genuine surprise before spitting out, "I’ll never come back!" and dragged the thug out of the store.

<b>

Wow, they were really a troublesome bunch. It’s incredible that people like this actually exist!

Alma-san once said, "They occasionally show up, but when they do, just knock them out and throw them out," and she mentioned handling them lightly.

Well, there’s absolutely no need to show mercy to those who come to someone else's store and shout whatever they want!

<b>

"Suu-chan, you were amazing!!"

"Hagyu?!"

"You were the best with that silent 'pressure'! You exceeded my expectations!!"

"Um, A-Alma-san?"

"Such a strong, cute, and capable girl! I might just lose it!! Nnmmuu!!"

"Hanya?! A-Alma-san? Alma-san!! Why are you hugging me? Why are you touching me?!!"

"Nfufu, since the field magic is still active, how about a little reward in here?"

"W-what do you mean by reward?!!!"

<b>

"Alma-san! No touching Suu-chan allowed!!"

<b>

Just as I was suddenly hugged by Alma-san and was about to be subjected to something, Mia's voice echoed around us.

Whoa! Did the field magic just break? Is it anti-magic?!

<b>

"Fwoah?! Mia-chan?! W-why? It should have been under recognition obfuscation?!"

"My Suu-chan sensor can't be fooled by something like that!!"

"This girl doesn’t make any sense!!"

<b>

I don’t understand either, but this is suddenly chaotic!
