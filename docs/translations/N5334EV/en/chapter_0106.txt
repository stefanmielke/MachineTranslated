# Chapter 94: Northmilia Adventurers Guild

Finally, the first one of the year＾＾；

Belatedly, Happy New Year!

<b>

I’m sorry for making you wait!!

----------------

<b>

"Welcome to the Northmilia Adventurers Guild! Are you here to apply for registration?"

"Yes! I would like to register! Is this the right place for the procedure?!"

"Yes! I will assist you here!"

<b>

Across the counter of the adventurers' guild, the receptionist was smiling brightly, engaging in conversation with Bibi for the registration.

<b>

This is inside a building located on a corner of the main street of Dekember, called 'Alfalfa Boulevard,' where commercial facilities and offices are lined up.

The building was so magnificent that it looked like some kind of museum, and since it was only 50 meters away from the carriage stop, the location seemed quite good.

I couldn’t help but stare up at the building in awe, thinking how amazing the adventurers' guild is.

<b>

Well, speaking of amazing, the journey from getting off the carriage to arriving here was incredible too!!

<b>

It was supposed to be a short distance of less than 50 meters after getting off the carriage.

Yes, it was a short distance of less than 50 meters.

Yet, despite such a short distance… 

Why did I get tangled up so much?!

<b>

Just taking about five steps and some flashy characters approached! "Hey! Girl!" I learned today that creatures like that really exist in this world?!

Well, most of them would flee before they got close enough to reach out, succumbing to Lombard's "pressure"!

With a height close to 190 cm, broad shoulders, and a thick chest, Lombard's glare would scare off most people.

<b>

Still, there are some who dare to come past that pressure.

And those guys usually head towards Mia!

Of course! Even when approached, Mia elegantly ignores them.

But if someone persistently says, "Hey! Wait up!" and tries to touch Mia, the next moment, Mia, still smiling, delivers a body blow that deeply pierces their gut.

And thus, a writhing piece of filth is created. …Scary, isn’t it?

<b>

Well, there’s also the story of telling our guys to do something before it gets to Mia… But Arvin had turned into a dedicated protector for Bibi, and Lombard was mainly guarding Karen, who was holding my hand, so Mia naturally ended up solo.

That’s probably where those guys aimed, and generally, if you walk around shaking that much mass, they’re bound to come close!!

<b>

Still, the way those guys approached was really creepy! The way they swarmed reminded me of black pests!

The way they came crawling, making rustling sounds, was truly hair-raising?!!

<b>

And by the time Mia had completely turned into a "flirty boy magnet," we finally arrived here.

<b>

"Are you registering as a group of friends? We welcome groups of girls! Right now, if you register with four or more people, we’ll give you a congratulatory gift of 50C per person!"

"Oh—, we’re registering together, but it’s not just girls!"

"Oh, I see! My apologies! Then, these two are joining as well?"

"Yes! We came to register as this group of six today!"

"Understood! In any case, since there are more than four of you, you will receive the congratulatory gift, so please rest assured!"

"Oh! Is that so? Thank you!"

"Group registrations are always welcome!"

<b>

The receptionist and Bibi continued their conversation smoothly.

I realized again that Bibi is quite accustomed to these things, huh.

<b>

"Now, please fill out the necessary information on this form."

<b>

Bibi received the registration forms for the number of people and handed them out to everyone.

Hmm, surprisingly, the items to fill out are quite normal, aren’t they?

I thought there would be more questions like whether you specialize in swords or magic, or what skills you possess, but… is that not particularly necessary?

<b>

"Oh, and you all are students of 'Miliacastle Eye Boarding School,' right? You only need to fill in your names and hometowns on the form, and once you’re done, please show your student IDs together."

"Oh! That’s quite simple!"

"Since you are students of Miliacastle Eye, there’s no doubt about it."

<b>

The receptionist continued with a smile, "So, there’s no need for an admission review."

I see, indeed, the student ID is a form of identification.

Still, I can’t help but think that our school is quite reputable… as I reflect on it.

<b>

"Now, I will briefly explain about our adventurers' guild."

<b>

Once everyone filled out the forms and showed their student IDs, the receptionist invited us to sit in the chairs in front of the counter and began to speak after confirming that everyone was seated.

<b>

"First, our adventurers' guild has ranks, and all of you who just registered today will start at the initial rank of 'F Rank.'"

<b>

Oh! So it’s a rank system! Yes, yes! That’s a staple of adventurers' guilds! Hm? But they call adventurers 'members'? That’s a bit different.

<b>

"'F Rank' is a trial period. If you complete three jobs, you will be promoted to the next rank, 'E Rank.' However, please ensure that the jobs are completed within ten days of each other. Well, if you can do one job a week, that should be fine. If there’s a gap of more than ten days, you’ll have to start counting from the beginning again, so please be careful.

The next 'E Rank' is called the apprentice rank. If you complete a total of ten days of work within three months, you will be promoted to the general member rank of 'D Rank.' And――――"

<b>

The receptionist continued to explain in a calm manner. Everyone was listening attentively, nodding along.

Oh, I see, C is the title of "Team Leader." To move up to C, a recommendation from another "Team Leader" is needed. To become B, further approval from above is required, and as the ranks go up, the income increases as well. That’s only natural… But is there no S rank?

Hmm, but what is this feeling of discomfort?

It seems quite easy to move up ranks just by accepting jobs… Is there no exam when becoming an adventurer or when leveling up?

<b>

"――――Do you have any questions up to this point?"

"Um, is there no promotion exam when moving up ranks?"

"Yes? A promotion exam? For rank-ups, as long as you meet the specified conditions I just mentioned, there’s no particular exam set."

"I see… so that’s how it is… understood. Thank you."

"Is there anything else? If there are no further questions, I will conclude the explanation here for now. The details of what I just explained, as well as other guild regulations, are detailed in this booklet, so please be sure to read through it."

<b>

I thought the adventurers' promotion exam was a staple… It seems there’s no practical exam before entering either.

The receptionist gave me a somewhat troubled smile, as if to say, "I think I explained everything…"

After that, she took out a thin notebook the size of a paperback book and distributed one to each of us.

<b>

"Well then, this concludes our explanation. It will take a little time for your cards to be prepared, so please wait for a while on that sofa over there."

<b>

Holding onto a vague sense of unease, we all headed to the waiting sofa as instructed.

Yes, this waiting area was quite different from what I had imagined an adventurers' guild would be.

When I think of an adventurers' guild waiting area, I picture a shabby tavern where "rough men" gather, right?

It’s a staple for drunken veterans to hit on the kids who come to register, isn’t it?!!

However, this place was clean and organized, much like a bank.

Well, cleanliness is good! It’s definitely better than being dirty! Yes!

But what is this feeling that it’s not quite right?!

<b>

The people in the waiting room were quietly seated, looking at files or probably checking a bulletin board with job postings.

There were about twenty people in the room? Either way, everyone was well-behaved, quiet, and calm.

<b>

Oh, there are several students from our school here. Most of them seem to be upperclassmen? Oh? There are also some classmates over here...

As I was thinking that, two of those classmates approached us.

<b>

"Um, did you all come to register today?"

"Yes! We just finished the registration!"

<b>

With a friendly smile, one of the classmates who approached was Kuu Meruru, who is also a classmate.

<b>

"Then, you’re waiting for the card to be issued now?"

<b>

The other one, who spoke in a quiet manner, was Selki Mau, also a classmate.

<b>

"That’s right. Have you two already registered a while ago?"

"Yes, we completed our registration as soon as we entered the summer break."

<b>

With her light reddish-brown hair that had a soft wave, Kuu Meruru is a half-beast person from Dekember.

Selki Mau, with her beautiful long blue hair, is a sea person from Oceanos.

<b>

Both of them are what are called "internal students," having been in Miliacastle Eye since the elementary school.

In contrast, students like us, who entered from the junior high school through entrance exams, are referred to as "external students."

Since we just started school, there seems to be a subtle atmosphere between us external students and the internal students who have been studying at Miliacastle Eye for years, but these two were kind-hearted individuals who actively approached us external students who were still unfamiliar with the school.

<b>

Moreover, as you can tell from her name, Kuu Meruru is actually the younger sister of Kuu Emeru, who we traveled with on the way to Dekember!

I was truly surprised when I first met her in the classroom!

Furthermore, Selki Mau is also deeply connected to Amukamu, being from Oceanos.

Because of that, we had already become friends on the first day of school.

<b>

"What will you all do after registering?"

"I’m thinking of asking if there are any jobs available right away! If there’s a short job, I’d like to finish it quickly! I want to level up as soon as possible!"

"If that’s the case… how about the job we took? There should still be openings available… and it’s a job that takes about an hour to complete."

"Oh! That’s an attractive invitation! I might want to ask about it!"

"Then, I’ll accompany you to the reception to check it out."

<b>

Bibi and Selki headed to the reception together to check on the job.

It seems like the first job is about to be decided already.

<b>

"Um… is it really okay for me to join you?"

"Of course, Karen. I’m happy to be able to do my first job with you."

"Oh, thank you. Hearing you say that makes me…"

<b>

I took Karen’s hands, which were still somewhat hesitant, and held them reassuringly.

From what Karen had said before we got here, she wanted to register with the adventurers' guild as soon as possible.

I haven’t heard the details of why she wanted to register quickly, but since we’re in the same dorm and have become friends, it would be nice if we could start together!

Karen blushed slightly and returned my grip. It seems she felt reassured for now.

<b>

…Still! The way Karen shyly fidgets while holding my hand is just too cute, isn’t it?!

Would it be bad if I hugged her like this? Would it be bad?! I guess I should refrain from such actions here since there are other people around.

If it were Mia, she would probably go for it without caring about onlookers! Well, I have my sense of propriety! Yes! I’ll hold back!

But still, Karen is so adorable!

<b>

<b>

"Oh! It’s Cloud! Hello! What a coincidence to meet you here!"

<b>

Suddenly, someone interrupted the sweet moment between Karen and me without reading the air.

It was from another classmate who was in the waiting room.

<b>

Yes, I noticed you.

I never thought I would run into you here, really!

<b>

"Oh? Good day, Mr. Davis. It truly is a coincidence."

<b>

I responded as if I had just noticed the voice's owner.

The one I responded to was Daniel Davis, who was walking towards us with a carefree smile and a hand raised.

<b>

He is a boy from the fourth group who, on the day I entered the dorm, unleashed an angry corkscrew in the rose garden and flamboyantly got thrown away.

<b>

----------------

Thank you for always reading!

<b>

Finally, I could mention Daniel’s name...

It took too long, didn’t it?＾＾A
