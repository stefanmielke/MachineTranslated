# 94 Northmilia Adventurers' Guild

Finally, the first one this year;

A belated Happy New Year!

<blank>

Sorry for the wait!


----------------

<blank>

Welcome to the Northmilia Adventurers Guild! Are you applying for registration?"

Yeah! I'd like to register! Is this the right procedure?

Yes, I'll be right here! We'll be right here!"

<blank>

Over the counter at the Adventurers' Guild, the woman at the reception desk is exchanging information with Bibi for registration, with a smile that is almost spilling out of her face.

<blank>

This is in a building on one of De Kembel's main streets, called "Alfalfa Boulevard," which is lined with commercial buildings and offices.

The building looked like a museum or something. The location of the building is not more than 50 meters away from the carriage stop, so it seems to be in a very good location.

I looked up at the building in front of me as if I were dumbfounded.

<blank>

Speaking of amazing, it was amazing from the moment I got off the carriage to the moment I arrived at this place!

<blank>

It was supposed to be a short distance, less than 50 meters, once we got off the carriage.

Yes, it is a short distance, less than 50 meters.

It's such a short distance. ......

Why do I get tangled up like that?

<blank>

I only had to go about 5 steps and a charlatan came up to me! He said, "Hey! Hey, girlfriend!" I also learned for the first time today that there really are creatures in this world that call out to you, "Hey!

Most of them, however, succumbed to Lombardo's "pressure" and ran away before they could get within arm's reach!

After all, at nearly 190 tall, with broad shoulders and a thick chest plate, a glare from Lombardo would scare most guys away.

<blank>

Still, there are some people who will come over that pressure.

And those guys usually go by Mia!

Of course! Mia is gloriously through when approached.

Still persistent, he said, "Hey, wait! Wait!" If you try to touch Mia's body, the next thing you know, she's smiling as she delivers a body blow that pierces deep into your bosom.

And there you have it, one agonizing mess. ...... is a scary place to be.

<blank>

Well, do something about our guys before they reach out to Mia! I know, I know. ....... But Irving had become Bibi's personal machine? Lombardo was the main guard for Karen, who was holding hands with me, so Mia was a natural soloist.

I guess that's where they take advantage of the mass of the animals, and with two of them swinging and walking around, it's no wonder they come to you!

<blank>

Anyway, the way the men came close to me was really creepy! The way they came one after another reminded me of black pests!

I got goosebumps when he came up to me, rustling!

<blank>

And when Mia had become a "flirtatious guy whore," I finally found this place and here I am.

<blank>

Are you registering with a group of friends? Groups of girls are welcome! Right now, if you register 4 or more, we'll give you 50c for each one of you as a congratulatory gift!"

'Oh, we're registered together, though! It's not just the girls!"

Oh, is that so? I apologize. So these two are with you, then?"

I know! These six of us are here today to register!"

I'm sorry," he said, "but we are not going to give you a prize! In any case, since there are more than four of us, you can rest assured that we'll be paying out the congratulatory money!"

Oh," he said! Really? Thank you!"

Because you're welcome to register with us as a group, either way!"

<blank>

The receptionist's sister and Bibi were carrying on a stagnant conversation.

I knew you were scared, and I feel again that you are used to this kind of thing, un.

<blank>

Now, please fill out this form.

<blank>

Bibi receives a registration form from her sister for the number of people and hands it to everyone.

Hom, surprisingly the items you write are normal, huh?

If you are an adventurer's union, you should ask yourself more questions like, do you specialize in swords or magic? I thought that an adventurers' guild would be more like an application for "what skills do you possess? I thought that you would have to apply to ......, but I guess it's not necessary?

<blank>

Oh, and you are also students at the Milia Castel Eye Boarding School, right? Please fill out the form with just your name and hometown, and present your student ID card when you are finished.

Oh my! That was so easy!"

Because if you're a student at Milia Castel Eye, you're in good hands."

<blank>

The sister smiled and continued, 'So there is no need to screen for membership.

I see. It's true that the student ID card is an ID itself, isn't it?

But then again, I guess our school is pretty trustworthy. ......

<blank>

Now, let me give you a brief overview of the Adventurers' Association.

<blank>

After everyone had filled out the forms and shown their student ID cards, the receptionist offered us chairs in front of the counter and, after making sure we were all seated, began to talk with us.

<blank>

First of all, there are different grades for members of the Adventurers' Guild, and those of you who have just registered today will start with the first grade, 'F' rank.

<blank>

Oh! I knew it was a rank system! Mm-hmm! It's an iron plate of the Adventurers' Guild, isn't it? Hmm? But adventurers are called members? That's strange.

<blank>

The "F" rank is a probationary period; after three jobs, you will be promoted to the next "E" rank. However, please do not exceed 10 days between jobs. Well, you should do it once a week for sure. If there is more than 10 days between jobs, you will have to start counting from the beginning again.

The next rank, "E rank," is called Apprentice. If you work a total of 10 days within 3 months, you will be promoted to the next rank, "D rank", which is the next general membership. And ----"

<blank>

The receptionist continued her explanation in a casual manner. Everyone was listening attentively.

So, C is the title of "Team Leader"? So to move up to C, I need the recommendation of the same Team Leader, and to move up to B, I need approval from higher up, and the higher the rank, the more money I earn? That's obvious. ...... And there is no S rank?

Hmmm, but what is it? What is this strange feeling?

It's pretty easy to just take a job at first and go up in rank. ...... Isn't there some kind of test when you become an adventurer, or when you move up in rank?

<blank>

"---- any questions so far?"

Oh, um, when you move up in rank, is there a promotion exam or something?"

Yes? Is it a promotion test? We don't have a specific test for rank advancement, as long as you fulfill the predetermined conditions as I just mentioned?"

"I see. ......, yes, that's right. ......, I understand. Thank you very much."

Is there anything else? If there are no further questions, I will end my explanation here. Please be sure to read through this booklet, which contains detailed descriptions of what I have just explained, as well as other rules and regulations of the association.

<blank>

I thought the promotion exams for adventurers were also ironclad. ...... It seems there is no such thing as a competency test before entering.

I think I explained it to your sister, ......, and she gave me a troubled smile.

Afterwards, paperback-sized thin notebooks were brought out for the number of people and handed out to each one of them.

<blank>

Please wait a moment on the sofa over there. It will take some time before your cards are ready, so please wait a moment on the sofa over there.

<blank>

With a somewhat bewildered feeling, we all headed to the waiting couch as we had been told.

Yes, this waiting area is not what I expected from an adventurers' association.

When you think of an adventurers' guild waiting room, you imagine a barroom where a bunch of "sweltering bastards" hang out, right?

It's also ironic that a drunken veteran of poor quality gets involved with the kids who came to register there!

However, the waiting room and counter were clean and neat, just like those in a bank.

Well, clean is good! Clean is better than dirty, of course! Duh!

But what is this "not so" feeling?

<blank>

The people in the waiting room are also sitting quietly, looking at something like a file or maybe a bulletin board with jobs posted on it. They are looking at it.

I'd say there are less than 20 people in the room. Either way, everyone is well behaved, quiet and docile.

<blank>

Oh, there are a few students from our school. Mostly upperclassmen? Oh? There are some classmates over here: .......

Then, two of his classmates came up to me.

<blank>

Um, are you all here to register today?"

I just got registered! I just got registered!"

<blank>

The classmate who approached me with a smiling, friendly smile was Cu Merle, also a classmate.

<blank>

'So now you are waiting for your card to be issued?'

<blank>

The other person who spoke to me in a quiet manner was also a classmate, Selkie Mau.

<blank>

I'm sorry," he said. You two already registered a long time ago, right?"

Yes, we did as soon as we started our summer vacation.

<blank>

Cu Merle, with her lovely fluffy, lightly webbed auburn hair, is a half-breed from De Kembel here.

Selkie Mau, with her beautiful long blue hair, is a maritime person from Oceanoos.

<blank>

Both of you are so-called "insiders" who have been at Milia Castel Eye since the elementary school.

On the other hand, students like us who enter from the middle school through entrance examinations are called "outsider students.

It seems that there is still a delicate atmosphere between us outsiders and insiders who have been studying at Milia Castel Eye for a number of years, but these two were very kind people who proactively approached outsiders who were not yet familiar with the school and took care of them.

<blank>

And as you can see from her name, Cu Merle is actually the sister of Cu Emel, who was with us on the way to Dekenberu!

I was really surprised when I first met him in the classroom!

Furthermore, Selkie Mau is also from Oceanoos, which has close ties to Amcam.

Because of this, I had already become friends with these two on my first day of school.

<blank>

What are you all going to do when you're done registering?"

I'm going to ask around and see if there is a job I can do right away! If there is a job that only takes a short time, I'd like to get it done! I want to move up the ranks as quickly as possible!"

How about the job we got at ......? There should still be openings at ...... and the job should only take about an hour.

Oh my! That's a tempting offer! Let me ask you something!"

Then I will accompany you to the reception desk and we will check it out."

<blank>

Bibi and Mr. Selkie headed to the reception desk together to check on their work.

Something tells me that I'm going to get my first job as soon as possible.

<blank>

Oh, um, ......, are you sure you don't mind if I join you?"

Of course, Karen. I'm glad I got to work with you for the first time, okay?

Oh, thank you. It's nice to hear you say so. ......"

<blank>

I took Karen's hands, who was still reserved for some reason, and squeezed them for reassurance.

Karen told us that before coming here, she wanted to register with the Adventurers' Guild as soon as possible.

I haven't been able to ask her why she wanted to register so early, but ......, we shared the same dorm room and became friends, so it would be great if we could start together anyway!

Karen-san shook my hand with a slight blush on her cheek. She seemed relieved for the time being.

<blank>

......But still..! I think it's cute that Karen is holding my hand and bewildered!

Is it wrong if I hug you like this? Is it wrong? I guess I should refrain from such behavior because of the publicity of other people here in Quicksilver.

If it were Mia, I'm sure she would have gone through with it without being seen! Well, I have a sense of decency! Ummm..! I'll refrain!

But, after all, Karen-san is kawayusu!

<blank>

<blank>

Oh! It's Miss Cloud after all! Hello! What a coincidence to see you here!"

<blank>

In the sweet space between Karen and I, there was someone who suddenly approached us without even reading the air.

It came from another classmate who was in this waiting room.

<blank>

Yeah, I noticed that about you.

I really didn't expect to see you here, either!

<blank>

Oh? "Hello, Mr. Davis. It's a real coincidence, isn't it?

<blank>

He turned to the owner of the voice as if he had just noticed it for the first time.

In response, he raises one hand, smiles, and walks toward us.

<blank>

He is Daniel Davis, a student in the fourth group.

On the day I entered the dormitory, a male student shot out a corkscrew in anger in the rose garden and blew me up with a loud bang.



<blank>

----------------

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

Finally, I was able to mention Daniel's name...

Too much time has passed.
