# 181 Episode 181 Karen's Protector

After the afternoon tea, Annie's classmates and their children begin to leave the venue.

By the time the clock strikes five, the children's time is over and the party venue has moved on to the consulate.

<blank>

As the sun sets and the consulate lights begin to twinkle and illuminate the area, it signals the beginning of the night.

<blank>

As night falls, carriages arrive at the consulate one after another.

<blank>

Lawrence Niven and Van Niven.

The father and son were one such group of invited guests.

<blank>

As he was ushered into the venue, Van turned his attention to one corner, where he raised his eyebrows slightly.

<blank>

Out of the corner of his eye, Karen Merlin was laughing happily with the people around her.

<blank>

There is not a trace of melancholy in his heart, and his smile is carefree, reminiscent of the spring sunshine.

It was something he found hard to believe out of the blue.

<blank>

Karen suddenly turned to him, perhaps noticing Van's gaze. Her eyes widened in surprise, but her smile blossomed immediately and she walked over to him with light steps.

<blank>

'Little Father Niven! Brother Van, it's been a long time! I didn't know you two were here.

<blank>

"Karen, isn't it? What are you doing here?

<blank>

Lawrence Niven, who was standing alongside Van, was also surprised when he saw Karen coming.

<blank>

"We are pleased to accept your invitation to visit ....... Thank you for your courtesy."

<blank>

How?"

<blank>

Lawrence's eyes narrow slightly as he looks at Karen, who looks down and answers him with a sly smile.

<blank>

Karen. You seem to be doing very well. Are you enjoying school life?"

<blank>

'Yes, Brother Van! I've been all over the place. ......"

<blank>

Karen answers with a slight blush on her cheeks. Van looks down at her and sees a dark shadow in her eyes.

Karen, oblivious to Van's condition, happily talked about the new friends she had made.

<blank>

If he is working hard in his studies, it will be worth sending him to the academy."

<blank>

Yes, I am! I will always be grateful to the Little Father!"

<blank>

He says, "You say the nicest things. I'm going to go to ....... Oops, I think they're calling me over there. Excuse me for a moment."

<blank>

Handing the empty glass in his hand to a nearby waiter, Lawrence told Karen to go ahead and enjoy herself, then turned to the people who had approached him.

Van pulled his face slightly and whispered in Karen's ear, "These are my father's supporters," he said to these people. Karen nodded and said, "I see.

<blank>

Van turned to Karen again and moved his gaze from the top of her head to the tips of her shoes, as if he were pricing her out.

<blank>

I can tell that what Karen is wearing is tailored from very high quality fabrics. The shoes are not made in the USA.

Her elegantly coiffed hair was very shiny, indicating the high quality of the styling materials used.

Even the accessories adorning the hair, though small, are made of gemstones and pearls.

None of these items can be provided with this girl's personal funds.

<blank>

Suddenly, Van's attention was on her, and Karen felt uncomfortable and couldn't help but look at him.

<blank>

"Oh, uh, ......, uh, ......."

<blank>

It's a beautiful dress, Karen.

<blank>

'Thank you. It's my pleasure, Brother Van."

<blank>

I'm glad to hear you're having a good time."

<blank>

I am grateful to my father in Niven and my brother Van for sending me! I owe it all to Little Father Niven and Brother Van for sending me out."

<blank>

............ changed the mood a little bit?"

<blank>

...... Uh, is that right?"

<blank>

You weren't the kind of kid who would talk to someone with a twinkle in your eye like that."

<blank>

If ...... has changed, it's because of all of you."

<blank>

O obedient lamb who has never doubted, who has never disobeyed, who cannot resist my word.

<blank>

"...... Van ...... brother?"

<blank>

What has happened to the yarn I spun?"

<blank>

Um, ............ what are you talking about?"

<blank>

Karen felt uncomfortable and her gaze wandered around.

<blank>

At that moment, I heard a voice calling her from the back.

She looks in the direction of the voice, then turns to Van as if in a panic.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Brother Van! I've been called away."

<blank>

Karen then turns her back and walks away at a quick pace.

Van Niven quietly looked away from that small back with cold, light-filled eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

I don't see Mr. McGovern here.

<blank>

Maybe he wants to let people know that they don't need to attend a gathering of this magnitude to be assured of the seven-seat position."

<blank>

No, perhaps you have finally made up your mind to retire from the post of the seventh seat.

<blank>

The men are smiling, not exactly elegant, and chatting with each other while sipping from the glasses in their hands.

At the center of it all is Lawrence Niven.

<blank>

When Lawrence notices Van approaching them, he pulls a face and asks in a small voice.

<blank>

What's going on, Van!"

<blank>

Apparently, it's out of my hands.

<blank>

"You mean to tell me that ...... 'control' is unraveling?"

<blank>

Don't worry, Father. I can handle this much any way I want."

<blank>

Now the movement is uncertain. Don't let them do anything bad."

<blank>

I know what I'm doing.

<blank>

Worst case scenario, you get the key to the treasure.

<blank>

As you wish."

<blank>

Van Niven showed his head quietly bowed with an icy light in his eyes and an emotionless smile on his mouth.

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

Dalton, calling Karen over, asks her with a soft look in his eyes.

<blank>

What's wrong, Karen?"

<blank>

Ah! I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman! No, no, it's nothing. ......"

<blank>

"Well, that's a little too forward. I wish you'd call me Uncle Dollar like you used to."

<blank>

What? Well, that's a quirky thing to do now. ......"

<blank>

Oh?" Looks like Dalton is giving Karen a hard time."

<blank>

Oh, Father Bona! No, that's not what I meant. ......"

<blank>

"MU......"

<blank>

"What's the matter, Dalton? Do you envy me for calling you "Little Father"?"

<blank>

You look pretty comfortable, Borna.

<blank>

'It's your fault for being naughty and not telling me your name. Haven't you always been like that? The bill for your pranks always comes back to you."

<blank>

It really does upset me to hear you say that."

<blank>

<blank>

Your father is always so much fun ......"

<blank>

What?" Is that right ......?"

<blank>

<blank>

I'll tell you what, Karen. "Well, Karen, after the field trip next week, why don't you come to the mansion for the first time in a long time? Iriela would love to see you."

<blank>

Yes, Karen! Your mother is worried about you! And I'll show you around town for the first time in years! You'd be surprised how much has changed since then!

<blank>

Huh? Huh? And, but do we have time for that?"

<blank>

It's all right. "Hey, Dalton? You've got time for that, right?"

<blank>

Well, sure. After three days and two nights, there will be consecutive holidays. I'll have time to relax, so it won't be a problem. I'll be at ......, but yes, I'm sure I'll be there. Maybe I'll join you then.

<blank>

No, no, no, you're supposed to be dealing with the aftermath by now. You can't take the time to do that, can you?"

<blank>

I'm in a protective position now," she said. I'm her guardian now. I'm her guardian now, and I don't think she needs permission to stay out overnight if I'm with her, do you?"

<blank>

I don't think you should use her as an excuse to run away from your job, Dalton."

<blank>

They told me that Dalton was her guardian and I said, "What? Really?" Karen looks surprised.

Dalton sees this and smiles, "That's right.

He explained that when the twins were placed in the care of the school, Karen and her siblings signed a document stating that the school's chairman would be responsible for their protection.

Karen also reminds me of that again, "Speaking of which, .......

<blank>

So, you see," he said! It's my natural duty to follow you as your guardian!"

<blank>

Dalton Banjo pointed to the heavens and said, as if in a high declaration.

<blank>

"So you're going to tell the secretaries and Mrs. Sheldon, aren't you?"

<blank>

At Bona's calmly questioning words, Dalton Banjo quietly lowered his raised hand, and still quietly looked away.
