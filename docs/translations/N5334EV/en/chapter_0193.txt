# Chapter 181: Karen's Guardian

After the afternoon tea time, Annie's classmates and children begin to leave the venue.

By the time the clock hands pass 5 o'clock, the children's time is over, and the party venue shifts to the consulate.

<b>

As the sun sets and the lights of the consulate begin to shine brightly, illuminating the surroundings, it signals the start of the evening event.

<b>

As night falls, carriages arrive one after another at the consulate.

<b>

Lawrence Niven and Van Niven.

They were one of the invited guests.

<b>

Guided into the venue, Van's gaze turns to a certain corner, where he slightly furrows his brow.

<b>

In his line of sight, Karen Marlin was laughing joyfully with the people around her.

<b>

Her carefree smile, reminiscent of the spring sunshine, held not a trace of worry in her heart.

This was something he found hard to believe.

<b>

Noticing Van's gaze, Karen suddenly turned to look at him. She widened her eyes in surprise, but quickly broke into a smile and approached him with light steps.

<b>

"Uncle Niven! Van, it's been a while! I see you both are here too!"

<b>

"Is that you, Karen?! What brings you to a place like this?"

<b>

Lawrence Niven, standing alongside Van, also raised his voice in surprise upon confirming Karen's presence.

<b>

"I received an invitation... I accepted your kindness."

<b>

"Oh?"

<b>

Seeing Karen looking down shyly as she answered, Lawrence narrowed his eyes slightly.

<b>

"Karen. You seem to be doing very well. Are you enjoying school life?"

<b>

"Yes, Van! I'm always being taken care of by those around me..."

<b>

Karen replied, slightly blushing. In the depths of Van's gaze looking down at her, a faint shadow passed.

Unaware of Van's demeanor, Karen continued to cheerfully talk about her new friends.

<b>

"If you are working hard in your studies, it means sending you to school was worthwhile."

<b>

"Yes! I have always been grateful to Uncle Niven!"

<b>

"That's nice to hear. ...Oh, it seems I'm being called over there. Excuse me for a moment."

<b>

Handing his empty glass to a nearby waiter, Lawrence told Karen to "enjoy yourself" and headed towards the people who had called him.

Van leaned slightly closer to Karen's ear and whispered, "Those are my father's supporters." Karen nodded, saying, "I see."

<b>

Van turned back to Karen and moved his gaze from the top of her head down to her shoes as if appraising her.

<b>

He could tell that what Karen was wearing was made of quite high-quality fabric. Her shoes were likely not ordinary either.

Her elegantly styled hair was very lustrous, hinting at the high quality of the products used for styling.

Even the small accessories in her hair contained jewels and pearls.

None of these could be gathered from her own finances.

<b>

Feeling the sudden scrutiny from Van, Karen instinctively felt uncomfortable and began to avert her gaze.

<b>

"Um... well..."

<b>

"That's a lovely dress, Karen."

<b>

"Thank you. I'm happy to hear that, Van."

<b>

"It's good to see you thriving."

<b>

"Y-yes! This is all thanks to Uncle Niven and you, Van."

<b>

"........Has your atmosphere changed a bit?"

<b>

"Um, is that so?"

<b>

"You weren't the kind of child who spoke to someone with such sparkling eyes."

<b>

"If I've changed, I think it's thanks to everyone."

<b>

"You possess a docility that knows no doubt, a lamb that cannot resist my words, never opposing them."

<b>

"Um... Van...?"

<b>

"What has happened to the thread I spun?"

<b>

"Um... what do you mean?"

<b>

Feeling an indescribable discomfort, Karen instinctively began to wander her gaze.

<b>

At that moment, a voice called her from the back.

She turned her gaze toward the voice and then hurriedly turned back to Van.

<b>

"I'm sorry, Van! I've been called!"

<b>

With that, she bowed her head and quickly turned her back, leaving the spot.

Van Niven quietly watched her small back with eyes filled with cold light.

<b>

<b>

"Mr. McGavin is not here."

<b>

"He might want to show that he doesn’t need to attend such gatherings to secure the seventh seat."

<b>

"Or perhaps he has finally made up his mind to resign from the seventh position."

<b>

The men, wearing smiles that could hardly be called refined, chatted while tilting their glasses.

At the center of them was Lawrence Niven.

<b>

Noticing Van approaching them, Lawrence leaned in and quietly questioned him.

<b>

"What’s going on, Van?!"

<b>

"It seems she has slipped from my grasp."

<b>

"Are you saying the 'control' is unraveling?"

<b>

"Rest assured, Father. This is nothing I can't handle."

<b>

"Right now, the movements are unclear. Don't let her do anything foolish."

<b>

"I understand."

<b>

"At the very least, make sure to secure that key gem."

<b>

"As you command."

<b>

Van Niven's eyes held an icy light as he wore a smile devoid of emotion, quietly bowing his head.

<b>

<b>

Dalton, who had called Karen over, looked at her with soft eyes and asked,

<b>

"Is something wrong, Karen?"

<b>

"Oh! P-President! N-no, it's nothing..."

<b>

"You're being distant. I want you to call me Uncle Dol like before."

<b>

"Eh? W-well, that’s a bit..."

<b>

"Oh? It seems Dalton is bothering Karen."

<b>

"Ah, Uncle Bona! No, it's not like that..."

<b>

"What's wrong, Dalton? Are you envious of her calling me Uncle?"

<b>

"You seem quite relaxed, Bona."

<b>

"It’s your fault for not introducing yourself. You've always been like this, right? The consequences of your mischief always come back to you."

<b>

"It's truly outrageous to hear that from you."

<b>

<b>

"Father seems to be having more fun than usual..."

<b>

"Eh? Is that so...?"

<b>

<b>

"Yes, Karen. After next week's outdoor class, why don't you come to the mansion for the first time in a while? Illyra is eager to see you."

<b>

"That's right, Karen! Your mother is also worried about you! And I’ll show you around the town after several years! You’ll be surprised at how much it has changed since then?!"

<b>

"Eh? Eh? But, will there be time for that?"

<b>

"Don't worry. Right, Dalton? There should be enough time for that."

<b>

"Well, that's true. After a two-night, three-day schedule, there’s a holiday afterward. So there should be no problem taking it easy. ...But, well, I might join you then."

<b>

"No, no, by that time you should be busy with post-event processing, right? Isn't it impossible for you to take time off?"

<b>

"Even so, Bona. Right now, I'm in a guardian-like position for her. I don't think she needs permission to stay out if I'm with her."

<b>

"I think it's questionable to use her as an excuse to escape work, Dalton."

<b>

Karen, surprised by being told that Dalton was her guardian, exclaimed, "Eh? Is that so?"

Seeing this, Dalton smiled and said, "That's right."

When the twins were to be taken care of by the academy, they had signed a document stating that the academy's principal would be responsible for their guardianship, including Karen.

Karen also recalled, "Now that you mention it..."

<b>

"So, it’s my duty as a guardian to accompany you!"

<b>

Dalton Banjo pointed to the sky and declared loudly.

<b>

"Make sure to tell the secretaries and Mrs. Sheldon that, okay?"

<b>

In response to Bona's calm question, Dalton Banjo quietly lowered the hand he had raised and averted his gaze.
