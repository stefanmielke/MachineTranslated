# Chapter 116: The Indignation of RuuRii Diet

Just before the evening of that day, RuuRii Diet was waiting in a corner of the same café terrace as the day before, to hear the results of her request.

<b>

Her irritation was evident on her face, and her consistently sullen demeanor stood out.

She treated the staff with an arrogant attitude, demanding them to bring her a replacement for her tea.

<b>

Unlike yesterday, she was sitting alone at the café terrace today.

Of course, she had invited Reirii, but was coldly turned down with, "I don't feel like going," and "I'm not interested in the results."

This was the main reason for her current displeasure.

<b>

Every time she recalled Reirii's response at that time, RuuRii's irritation grew larger.

<b>

<b>

Before long, she noticed that the person she was waiting for was approaching.

Seeing that figure slowly making its way through the crowd, RuuRii let out a loud tongue click.

<b>

Why can't they come faster when someone is waiting for them?!

In reality, they were stumbling along, struggling to move forward, but she had no emotional room to notice such things.

<b>

However, as RuuRii observed the approaching figure, she furrowed her brows at the sight, which was different from usual.

<b>

Her hair, usually neatly styled without a strand out of place, was now partially disheveled and her outfit was in disarray, even looking somewhat dirty.

<b>

It was a state unimaginable for someone who claimed to always follow the latest fashion.

<b>

As the person finally arrived, RuuRii, not bothering to hide her irritation, raised her voice roughly.

<b>

"What are you dawdling for, Katia?! Are you alone?!"

"Don't mess with me! What about that magic power monster?!!"

<b>

Not expecting a rebellious response to her insults, RuuRii was momentarily at a loss for words.

<b>

"…Huh? Magic power monster?"

"What do you mean making us deal with something like that?!"

"What do you mean?! Katia, what happened?!"

"Shut up! Parker got captured…!"

"Captured? What did you guys do?!"

"Damn it! How can we deal with something like that?! You! Are you trying to get us killed?!"

"Wait a minute? I don't understand what you're saying?!"

"If you want to die, do it yourself! Don't drag us into this!!"

<b>

After saying her piece, Katia turned and left without looking back.

Even though she was a local senior, RuuRii felt a considerable shock from the outburst of someone she had never received complaints from before, leaving her momentarily dazed.

<b>

<b>

But soon, the anger at being insulted began to rise slowly from the depths of her stomach.

<b>

Magic power monster? Is she talking about that big one who supposedly has the highest magic power in the academy?

Was it with Karen today too?

That idiot Katia got scared by that massive magic power! Pathetic!!

She usually acts so composed, but when it comes down to it, she gets frightened?! How embarrassing!

<b>

What the hell is this!! I can't stand it!!!!

<b>

Reirii has also been strangely quiet since that duel incident! Damn it! It's their fault!!

<b>

<b>

Van told me to keep an eye on Karen! What are they doing!!

<b>

<b>

Karen! Getting close to those kinds of people! Damn it! I can't stand it!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

From the beginning, I never liked Karen!

What does she mean by being the heir of Munanotos?!

Her family is drowning in debt, and it's already decided they are going to fall from grace as an old viscount family!

Then she suddenly appears and claims to be Reirii's fiancée!

<b>

What I can't stand is that I can tell Reirii doesn't mind that at all!

Reirii gets obviously upset when Karen doesn't pay attention to her!

I really can't stand it!

<b>

Even the status of the family isn't what it used to be in the ancient days of the nobility!

Now, our family, which is the mayor of Notos City, the center of Gruusmil, is above that!

Yet, she keeps a straight face no matter what is said to her!

I can't stand it!

<b>

Why does someone like her come all the way to the Gruusmil school?!

She should just attend the poor Munanotos school!!

<b>

Since coming to Milia, she hasn't even shown her face here once!

Thanks to that, Reirii's mood has visibly worsened day by day!

I really can't stand it!!

<b>

<b>

And what about those guys?!

They suddenly appear and keep getting in my way!

Whenever I try to deal with Karen as usual, they suddenly step in and glare at me! What do they think they're doing?!

<b>

Hiding behind Karen and in the end, they even let Reirii get hurt! How ridiculous!

<b>

What is Amukamu?!

They're just a bunch of uncivilized country bumpkins from the northern edge!

And they act like they're some kind of celebrities! I seriously can't stand it!!

<b>

What is that red-haired girl?! Being called a northern princess, is she getting full of herself?! She's just a mountain monkey being praised because her surroundings are a little better! Give me a break!

<b>

What is a magic power monster?!

That person is just someone with a large amount of magic power!

I've heard that they always cause explosions when trying to use magic!

Isn't it true that they haven't been able to use magic properly even once?!

What is there to be scared of someone like that?!

<b>

Seriously, I can't stand any of them!!

<b>

I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! I can't stand it!! I can't stand it!! I can't stand it!! I can't stand it!! I can't stand it!! I can't stand it!!! I can't stand it!!! I can't stand it!!!

I can't stand it!!!!!!!!!

<b>

RuuRii Diet felt her emotions being overtaken by the growing indignation within her, to the point where her vision turned red.

She was no longer even aware that she could not think rationally.

<b>

She had no way of knowing where the original seed of that anger came from.

<b>

Feeling that the swelling indignation was about to burst in her head, she hurriedly made her way toward the academy through the approaching twilight of the city.
