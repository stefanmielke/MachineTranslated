# 116 Ruly Deet's Chagrin

Shortly before the evening of that day, Lurie Diet was waiting for the desired party to arrive at the same corner of the café terrace as the day before, to hear the results of his request.

<blank>

He does not try to hide the irritation that appears on his face, and he is conspicuous by his moody behavior from start to finish.

He was also arrogant to the waitress and made her bring him a tea refill.

<blank>

Today, unlike yesterday, I am sitting alone on this café terrace.

Of course, Reilly had invited him, but he had bluntly refused to go with him, saying that he did not feel like going and that he was not interested in the outcome.

It is the most important factor in the cause of her current moodiness.

<blank>

Every time he remembers, Reilly's response to that moment grows more irritating for Lurie.

<blank>

<blank>

Soon after, I noticed that the intended recipient was heading our way.

Ruly clucked his tongue loudly at the sight of the figure slogging through the crowd.

<blank>

Why can't they come more quickly when people go to the trouble of waiting and doing it?

In fact, she is barely moving forward with her legs tangled, but she doesn't have the presence of mind to notice such a thing.

<blank>

But the closer the other party got, the more Lurie raised his eyebrows at how different his appearance was from usual.

<blank>

Her hair, which is usually tightly coiled so as not to allow any disorder, is untied and disheveled in places, and her attire is disheveled and even looks dirty.

<blank>

It is unimaginable for a woman who professes to always follow the latest fashions.

<blank>

Facing the person he had finally reached, Lurie did not even try to hide his irritation and raised his voice wildly.

<blank>

What are you waiting for, Katia? Are you alone?

Don't be silly! What is it? What's with the magic wand?

<blank>

Ruly is momentarily at a loss for words, not expecting a word of defiance in response to the curses he hurled at her.

<blank>

"What about ......? Magic Obake?"

What the hell do you think you're doing letting them do that to you?

What do you mean? Katia, what's going on?"

Ugh! They got Parker too ......!"

"Caught? What did you guys do?

I don't know how to deal with that thing! I can't deal with that thing! You! Are you trying to kill us?

I don't know what you're talking about! I don't understand what you're saying!

If you want to die, go ahead and die on your own! Don't bring us into this!

<blank>

Katia said as much as she could and left without even looking behind her.

Ruly was shocked at the outrage from someone who had never complained about him before, even though he was a local senior, and he fell in love with the place for a while.

<blank>

<blank>

But soon, anger at the abuse came up from the bottom of my stomach.

<blank>

The magic wacko? You mean that big guy who claims to have the highest magic power in the school?

Was he with Karen today?

Katia was hit by a huge, stupid magic power, and she was scared! What a pity!

You usually act so relaxed, but when the time comes, you get scared? That's disgraceful!

<blank>

What the heck! I don't like it ！！！！

<blank>

Reilly has become strangely quiet since that dueling fiasco! Damn it! It's their fault!

<blank>

<blank>

Master Van told me to take care of Karen! What are you doing!

<blank>

<blank>

Karen's guy! He's in on it with those guys! I don't like it! I don't like it!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the first place, I didn't like Karen from the beginning!

What is heir to Munanotos?

The house is riddled with debt, and it's not the old barony that's already set to fall!

It came out of nowhere and suddenly said he was Reilly's fiancée or something like that!

<blank>

I don't like it because I know Reilly doesn't like that!

Reilly is in an overtly bad mood when Karen doesn't deal with him!

I really don't like it!

<blank>

Even family status is not the same as it was in the olden days when there was an aristocracy!

Now we are the mayor of Notos, the center of Grouse Mill, and we are better than them!

And yet, they look cool no matter what is said!

I don't like it!

<blank>

Why would a guy like that come all the way to Grouse Mill school?

You just have to go to school in poor Munanotos!

<blank>

Even since I came to Milia, I haven't even shown up at Koch once!

Thanks to this, Reilly's mood was visibly worsening day by day!

I really don't like it!

<blank>

<blank>

And what are they?

They show up out of nowhere and keep interrupting me!

I'm about to give Karen the usual shove when all of a sudden she intervenes and glares at me! What is he trying to do?

<blank>

You hide something about Karen behind her back, and to top it all off, you even hurt Reilly! You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

What's with the amcam?

You're just a country bumpkin from the far north, a barbarian upstart!

That's what you get for pretending to be a celebrity of one kind or another! I seriously don't like it!

<blank>

What's with that redhead? Isn't she just a little bit arrogant, being called the princess of the north? She's just a monkey who's being lifted up just because she's slightly superior to everyone else around her! You've got to be kidding me!

<blank>

What's a magical obake?

That thing is just a big magic power!

I hear that you're always trying to use magic, but always manage to blow it up!

You're still talking about not being able to use magic properly, not even once!

Where in the world does a guy like that need to be scared?

<blank>

I don't like any of them at all!

<blank>

I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it! I don't like it!

I don't like it: ！！！！！

<blank>

Ruly Deet felt his own emotions occupied that day by a resentment that continued to swell inside him, to the point that his vision turned red.

At the earliest opportunity, he is unable to even realize that he is no longer capable of serious thought.

<blank>

She has no way of knowing where that original seed of anger originally came from.

<blank>

With a swelling chagrin that felt as if it would burst in my head at any moment, I made my way toward the school at a wild, hurried pace through the city as dusk was approaching.
