# Chapter 142: Each Night, Part 2 (In the Case of Colette Bear)

What a completely outrageous young lady...

Colette Bear felt the tension release from her body, and she could feel herself relaxing.

<b>

What is this "Golden Generation"?

What is this "Precious Child"!

<b>

That’s not something so cute!

Philippe! You’ve gone too far with this!

<b>

Irvin and the others said that child is a shield to protect them.

That’s certainly not wrong.

However, the implication of that is completely the opposite of what the outsiders perceive.

<b>

<b>

After seeing the incredible strength of Irvin and the others.

—The princess they are protecting must surely lack the strength. While being protected by her peers of the same age from the "Golden Generation," she is probably planning to develop her inner abilities while staying here in Dekembel—

<b>

When I saw the strength of Irvin and the others with my own eyes, I thought that.

<b>

Anyone would think that. It’s obvious.

Even those from other territories think so.

<b>

The outsiders are still undecided on whether they should win over her, who is at the center, before they establish their own system in Dekembel, or if they should build strong connections with her.

Or perhaps, they are still struggling to decide whether to pull out the children of the "Golden Generation" around her.

<b>

It’s completely a different premise of the conversation.

<b>

Is she even someone who can be won over?

<b>

While thinking about such things, I recalled my earlier encounter with Suzy.

I felt my throat tighten, and I almost spat out the brandy I had in my mouth with a "Goff!"

There’s no way those timid folks could handle her!

<b>

Just standing there made my hands tremble.

The intimidation that child exuded at that time was something that wouldn’t even be a match for someone who boasts a bit of skill in the underworld. It was something else entirely.

If by some mistake someone were to challenge her head-on, they would surely be obliterated.

That much I was certain of.

<b>

<b>

Now, are my boys properly following that young lady?

I’ve told them to guide her if necessary, but who knows what will happen...

<b>

I don’t think they’ll be able to find their hideout, but that young lady might just do something.

If she can somehow move this deadlocked situation, that would be a huge win.

<b>

We can’t let those bastards run wild any longer. It’s about time I teach them that I’m not so lenient as to let them do as they please forever.

<b>

<b>

"Boss!!"

"What is it, Odds? So noisy!!"

<b>

As Colette gazed across the Maguarat River to the north bank, lost in thought, the door was roughly and rudely flung open.

<b>

"Their hideouts are being crushed one after another!"

"What?!"

"Baird said it’s already the fifth location! ...He came rolling back into the office with a pale face!!"

"Fifth...?! What’s that about?"

"I don’t know! But he says it’s still going on! That Fluke guy is being rolled around all bloodied and battered!"

"Wait a minute! I can’t follow what you’re saying?"

"I don’t get it either! Just ask Baird directly! I don’t know if he can talk properly or not!"

"With that tough face, what the hell happened to him?"

"That’s why you need to ask him directly and find out!"

<b>

Colette was led by the member of the trading company called Odds towards the office. There, a big bearded man was sitting small at the table, waiting for Colette to arrive.

<b>

The man called Baird hurriedly tried to stand up when he spotted Colette, but she restrained him with her hand and settled him back into his chair.

Then, prompted by Colette, he began to report what had happened.

<b>

"I chased after her right after you told me to, but I lost sight of the young lady in no time at all..."

"What?! What are you doing?! Seriously! So? How did you manage to find her again?"

"Well, I searched around for about 30 minutes, but couldn’t find her... But then I heard there was a commotion across the Drunken Bridge, so I thought maybe? and went to check it out."

"The Drunken Bridge? Towards the old town?"

"Yeah! So when I went to check out the commotion... I saw what I thought were their soldiers... several of them... bloodied and... lying there..."

"Bloodied?"

"There were probably more than ten of them! The entrance to the shop was... I mean, how could it be that destroyed?! It was a total wreck..."

"............"

"And then! Suddenly something flew out of the upper window!! I recognized it immediately as a person... Zack, who was with me, said it was that Fluke. But his arms and legs were bent in strange ways... And before I knew it, that young lady was standing in front of him! I had no idea when she appeared!!"

"............"

"And then that young lady suddenly kicked Fluke like a ball! That big body flew away like a rubber ball!"

"Here, drink this and calm down."

<b>

As Baird began to get excited, Colette offered him a glass of brandy she had brought in front of him to help him calm down.

Before long, members and workers who sensed Colette’s tense atmosphere gathered in the office.

<b>

Baird downed the drink in one go, thanked Colette with a word, and then resumed his story.

<b>

"And then, after kicking Fluke into a building across the street, more than ten men came pouring out from there... But when the young lady approached them, they all flew away one after another! Like... Snap! Snap!"

<b>

"Can humans really be blown away that easily?! What the hell is that?! Is that magic?! Can magic blow humans away that easily?! Can you do that repeatedly?!"

<b>

――――If judged just by the story, it seems she is using magic without incantation.

However, using magic without incantation requires considerable skill and experience.

Does that young lady possess such magical prowess?

Moreover, using it in quick succession? Is that even possible?

I seem to recall hearing that those in the Exceed class could do that... If that’s the case, does that mean she is at that level? No, no, there’s no way she could be doing something so ridiculous while still being a student...

But wait, it might not even be magic at all――――

<b>

As Colette Bear thought that far, she recalled the shattered window glass from the intimidation Suzy had unleashed in the office and felt a shiver run down her spine.

<b>

"What’s terrifying is that young lady doesn’t change her expression at all! Those guys are bloodied, with their faces smashed and limbs torn off, and the area is like a sea of blood! Yet that young lady walks around with a cool face as if she doesn’t see any of it!"

<b>

"What on earth is she?!!" Baird shouted, his face losing color by the second.

The people around him, watching his state, also held their breath in astonishment.

<b>

"Right now, Zack and the others are chasing after the young lady. I rushed back to report to you, Boss!"

<b>

Colette placed a hand on Baird’s shoulder and said, "You’ve done well."

<b>

"…So? Do you know what happened to Fluke afterward?"

"I... I don’t know! I don’t even know if he’s alive!"

<b>

"He has quite a number of girls kidnapped. Many from his own family! There are still some whose whereabouts we can’t grasp! If there’s a chance to secure him, we must seize it! Do you understand!!"

<b>

Excluding the pale-faced Baird, those present all raised their voices in unison, "Yes!" as if to say, of course.

<b>

"That said, this is a bit too heavy for us. Someone! Run to the Amkam Consulate and bring this! I’ll write a note. Deliver it to Consul General Philippe Cloud!!"

<b>

Colette then looked around and raised her voice.

<b>

"Listen up, everyone! Tonight, the situation is definitely moving! We can’t let this opportunity slip away! If we’re going to repay our debts, there’s no other chance but tonight!!"

<b>

Whether this is a good opportunity or the brink of danger is unknown.

However, the luckiest thing tonight is that we have learned about an opponent we must never confront.

And that connection is a friendly one. It is likely that this will continue in the future.

<b>

As Colette listened to the battle cries of the men responding to her rallying call, she savored the fortune of having gained this knowledge today more than the fact that the situation was moving.
