# 142 Episode 142: Those Nights, Part 2 (The Case of Colette Baehr)

You are a totally outrageous young lady. ......

Colette Bair felt her whole body relax as she was released from tension.

<blank>

What is this 'golden generation'?

What's with the "treasured" children?

<blank>

That's not such a cute thing!

Phillip! You're no better than a raccoon dog!

<blank>

Irving and the others said it was a shield to protect the boy.

It is certainly not wrong.

But the implications are quite the opposite of what the outside world perceives.

<blank>

<blank>

After Irving and his team had shown so much ability.

--The princess that she is protecting is probably not up to par. I guess she plans to be protected by children of her own age, the "Golden Generation," and to develop her abilities, including her inner self, while she is here in Dekenberu.

<blank>

That's what I thought when I saw with my own eyes what Irving and his team were capable of.

<blank>

Everyone thinks so. It's only natural.

Even those from other territories think so.

<blank>

Should the others nostalgize her at the center or build a thick connection before they have yet to establish themselves in Dekenbel?

I hear that many places are still trying to decide whether they should pull out the children of the "golden generation" around them or not.

<blank>

I would say that the premise of the story is completely different.

<blank>

In general, does he have the balls to win over the people?

<blank>

Thinking about this, I recall my earlier encounter with Suzy.

I choked, "Gulp!" I almost spewed the brandy in my mouth.

There's no way they can handle it if they don't have enough guts!

<blank>

My hands shook just confronting them.

The intimidation she exuded at that time could not be matched by a man who was just a backstreet businessman and boasted of his skills. It's that kind of thing.

If you make the mistake of challenging them head-on, you will be obliterated for sure.

That much I could be sure of.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, I wonder if our boys are following that young lady around properly?

In some cases, I've told them to give me directions, but we'll see what happens. ......

<blank>

I don't think we will find their hideout, but that young lady makes me think she might be able to do something about it.

It would be great if we could move this stalemate in a good way.

<blank>

It's time to do something about those bastards. It's time to show them that we're not so warm and fuzzy that we'll let them do whatever they want forever.

<blank>

<blank>

Miss!

What's up, Odds? What a racket!

<blank>

As Colette was pondering this while gazing at the north bank of the Maguarat River, which she could see from her office, the door was opened roughly and inarticulately.

<blank>

They're taking out places they don't want to go!

What?

The guy from Baird said he's already been to five places! He came rolling back into the office, blue in the face!"

"Five locations: ......? What's that?"

I don't know! But he says it's still going on! He also says that that son of a bitch Fluke is rolling around in shreds of blood!"

Wait a minute! Can't you see what I'm talking about?"

I don't know either! Ask Baird directly! I don't know if I can talk to him properly!"

"What's wrong with your stern face? What's wrong with him?

So ask them directly and see for yourself!"

<blank>

Collette was taken by a member of the Chamber of Commerce, called Odds, from his office to the filling room. There, a large, bearded man sat small at a table, waiting for Collette to arrive.

<blank>

The large man called Baird rushed to stand up when he found Collette, but Collette restrained him with her hand and once again settled him in his chair.

Then, at Colette's urging, he begins to report what happened.

<blank>

I went after her as soon as she told me, but I lost her in the blink of an eye. ......

Oh?" What are you doing? Totally! And? How did you find me again?

I looked around for about 30 minutes, but I couldn't find it, so I went to ....... But I heard there was a commotion on the other side of the drunken bridge, so I went over there to see what was going on. So I went over there to see what was going on.

"Drunken Bridge? The one in the old town?

Hey! So I went over to where the commotion was, and I saw ....... And then I went over to where there was a commotion, and I saw a bunch of guys I think were their soldiers, and they were lying on the ground, covered in blood ......... ..."

Bloody?"

There were probably more than 10 people there! The entrance to the restaurant was also ...... broken in such a way that I wondered how it could be broken like that! It was so broken ......!

"............"

Then..! Suddenly something jumped out of the upper window! I immediately recognized it as a person. ...... Zack, who was with me, said it was the Fluke. But the limbs were bent in a funny way. ...... When I looked up, the lady was standing in front of him! I had no idea when she showed up!

".................."

She kicked Fluke in the face like he was a ball! Her big body was flying off the floor like a rubber ball!"

Take a drink of this and relax."

<blank>

As Baird began to get excited, Colette offered him a glass of brandy that she had brought in front of him, as if to calm him down.

Before long, the constituents and laborers, sensing Colette's tense atmosphere, gathered at the packing house.

<blank>

Baird gulped it down in one gulp, thanked Colette in a few words, and began to continue the conversation again.

<blank>

Then I kicked Fluke into a building across the street and another dozen or more men came out of the building. ...... But when the young lady approached them, they were all blown away! Like this: ...... snap! Snap!

<blank>

Is it possible for a human being to blow up that easily? What is it? Is that magic? Is that magic? Can magic blow people up that easily? Can it be done in rapid succession like that?

<blank>

Judging by the ---- story alone, they are probably using magic without chanting.

However, it must take a great deal of ability and experience to use magic without chanting.

Are you saying that that young lady is that good at magic?

And continuous use without any interval? Is such a thing possible?

I remember hearing that the Exceeds class we hear about would do that much ....... So you're saying your daughter is at that level? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

But wait, maybe it's not even magic to begin with: ----

<blank>

Colette Bear thought about it so much that she felt a shiver run down her spine as she recalled the broken window pane from the intimidation Suzy had unleashed in her office.

<blank>

What's so scary is that she doesn't even change her expression! They were covered in blood, their faces smashed and their limbs nearly shredded, and the whole area looked like a sea of blood! She was walking around with a cool expression on her face, as if she couldn't even see them!

<blank>

What the hell is she? Who is that young lady? Baird's face lost color as he shouted, "What the hell is she?

The people around us who were looking at the scene also gulped.

<blank>

Zack and the others are chasing after the young lady right now. I came back as fast as I could to report to Miss.

<blank>

Colette put her hand on Baird's shoulder, "Thanks for your help.

<blank>

"...... And? Do you know what happened to Fluke after that?"

I don't know! I don't even know if you're alive!

<blank>

He's kidnapped quite a few of my daughters. "He has kidnapped many of my daughters, and many of my relatives! Some of them we still don't know where they are! If there's a chance to get him, I'm going to take it! You know what I mean!

<blank>

Except for Baird, who had lost his color, everyone in the room shouted "Hey! and "Hey!" were the only words that came out of their mouths.

<blank>

I'm sure we're a bit overloaded, though. "Somebody, please run down to the Amkham consulate! Someone go to the consulate in Amkham! I'll write a note. I'll write a note, and you deliver it to Consul General Philip Cloud!

<blank>

Furthermore, Colette looks around and raises her voice.

<blank>

"All right, boys! Things are definitely moving tonight! You don't want to miss this! There's no better way to make up for what we've done to you than tonight!

<blank>

Whether this is an opportunity or a gateway to peril is not known.

But the most fortunate thing about tonight was that I got to know someone I should never antagonize.

And we are on friendly terms with those involved. Perhaps that can continue in the future.

<blank>

As Colette listened to the men yell in response to her incitement, she was chewing deeply on her good fortune to have had it today, rather than the fact that things had moved on.
