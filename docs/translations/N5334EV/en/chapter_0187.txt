# Chapter 175: Conversation in the Car

"Well then, miss, we are off."

<b>

"…Where are we going from here?"

<b>

"Oh, just a drive."

<b>

"If that's the case, you could at least take off the things on my hands and feet, right?"

<b>

"I'm just a bit worried. I can't help but feel anxious that the borrowed carriage might get damaged."

<b>

"If you take this off, you would understand that it's just an unnecessary worry, wouldn't you?"

<b>

"If I take it off, wouldn't that mean you're planning to turn this carriage into scrap?"

<b>

"That's ridiculous. What could a mere commoner's daughter possibly do?"

<b>

"However, I think this number is far from common."

<b>

"…Number?"

<b>

<b>

"This. The reading from the magical power measuring device."

<b>

"Is that what you pointed at my forehead…? It's not the five-element plate, is it?"

<b>

"Such an expensive item can't be easily carried around. If you're thinking of the five-element plate when you hear 'magical power measuring device,' then you're no longer a commoner. It's not something a commoner can easily come across."

<b>

"…………"

<b>

"This is a 'simple magical power measuring device.' If the magical power is less than 10, it won't react. If someone can be measured with this, they can apply to the temple to officially use the five-element plate. Didn't you know that?"

<b>

"…………You seem a bit out of touch with the world."

<b>

"Well, that's fine. According to this, your magical power exceeds 50 easily. That's certainly not a value a commoner could produce."

<b>

"…Isn't that normal?"

<b>

"They say everyone has magical power, but most people only possess a tiny bit. Only a handful of people can be measured with the five-element plate."

<b>

<b>

"My perception might be a bit different from that."

<b>

"How one perceives oneself varies from person to person. It's rare for one's self-evaluation to align perfectly with others' evaluations."

<b>

"I am well aware of that. …By the way, where is this carriage headed?"

<b>

"That's something to enjoy upon arrival. However, it will take some time to reach our destination. Since we're here, let's enjoy some conversation."

<b>

"I've been wondering about this since earlier… The way you speak is so different from how you were underground, and this forced politeness feels quite uncomfortable. Are you mocking me?"

<b>

"Ha ha ha! My apologies. I intend to treat you with respect, after all."

<b>

<b>

"If you have respect, you could at least remove these handcuffs with sincerity, couldn't you?"

<b>

"I have confirmed through a body check that you are not carrying any weapons. However, my intuition is negative about freeing you."

<b>

"I recommend you discard that useless intuition immediately. …Body check? Are you referring to that sexual harassment act?"

<b>

"Is that how you took it?"

<b>

"There's no other way to see it! That guy's nose could have been ripped off, and I wouldn't have minded!"

<b>

"…Could it be that you did something?"

<b>

"I think it was just karma."

<b>

"Then, let's keep those handcuffs on."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"…By the way, are we heading west… or northwest from the city?"

<b>

"May I ask why you think that?"

<b>

"The light window in the basement was supposed to be on the north side. After exiting the basement, I went around the building, but the exit was on the south side. After that, I got into the carriage and started heading west. The carriage left the city heading west, right? I know we stopped once at the gatekeeper's place before leaving the city. We must have run a bit along the East Canal Road, right? But just now, we turned into a side road to the right. Is our destination one of the mountains northwest of Hexagom?"

<b>

"…Ha ha! What keen observation. To figure that out even with your eyes covered, you certainly don't seem like a commoner's daughter."

<b>

"Because my eyes are covered, I can perceive even more, can't I?"

<b>

"Let's leave it at that."

<b>

"Since the leader of a band of thieves is personally escorting me, I look forward to seeing what kind of place I will be invited to."

<b>

"I am not the leader of thieves, you know? Why on earth do you think that?"

<b>

<b>

"Because of your demeanor underground. The way the others treated you was clearly out of fear. Even when walking inside the building, the people around stepped back, didn't they?"

<b>

"I'm impressed that you can notice such things. But unfortunately, I am just a lowly underling being used. Just a subordinate."

<b>

"So there is another boss?"

<b>

"That's correct."

<b>

"If you're not the boss, then what exactly are you? It's very unnatural for a mere subordinate to be so composed, you know?"

<b>

"Well, how should I put it? I'm more like a consultant? You really do observe well."

<b>

"I just enjoy observing people, you know? But you were feared quite a bit for a 'consultant.'"

<b>

"Goodness, do I really seem that way? However, that's just a misunderstanding. I am not the leader of a band of thieves."

<b>

<b>

"…I see, so you're the 'coordinator' of the thieves. That makes sense."

<b>

"You really seem intent on making me the leader of the thieves. I think that makes no sense at all."

<b>

"But there are people using you, right? I wonder what kind of people they are. I'm curious."

<b>

"…What do you plan to do with such knowledge?"

<b>

"Are you a bit angry? Did I say something to offend you? I'm just a bit curious, you know?"

<b>

"You might want to learn to suppress that curiosity. Haven't you heard that curiosity killed the cat?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Speaking of curiosity, there's one more thing I'm curious about."

<b>

"What is it this time?"

<b>

"Is it because you like those gloves that expose your fingers?"

<b>

"…What are you talking about?"

<b>

"I have friends who like those kinds of things… At that age, it's not surprising, you know. Oh, don't worry! I pride myself on having a good understanding of such tastes."

<b>

"How generous of you, miss. The boys around you must be envious. However, this is not a hobby of mine. It's just a coincidence."

<b>

<b>

"Is that so? I thought there might be a reason for your fingers being so cold like a corpse, yet not covering them completely with gloves."

<b>

"…The sensation in my fingertips is important. I am just constantly sharpening that sense."

<b>

"I see. I thought you might like such things, or perhaps… you have something to hide in your hands."

<b>

"…You say interesting things, miss."

<b>

"I just asked because I was a bit curious, you know?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I see, speaking of curiosity, have you heard the recent rumor that 'Roderick McGavin is adopting a distant relative and trying to marry her into the Bradley family, the head of Carnaflemer'?"

<b>

"Well, that's quite a celebratory story, isn't it?"

<b>

"Besides that, there are rumors that the girl McGavin brought to Hexagom is 'actually a young mistress' or 'a hidden child.' The streets are buzzing with gossip."

<b>

"Oh my! Such scandalous stories are circulating, huh? I'm curious!"

<b>

"Why are you so excited, as if you are an outsider? It's all about you, the lady accompanying McGavin."

<b>

"Oh? Is that how it turns out?"

<b>

"People are curious about who you really are."

<b>

"People are quite idle, aren't they?"

<b>

<b>

"There's one more interesting piece of information. 'McGavin hired two groups of bouncers in Dekkenbel.' One group consists of three members and is rank 5. They are directly guarding McGavin himself. The other group is of lower rank but is also a guard. Is that your guard, perhaps? But here's the thing: the information says that this group should also consist of three members. Two are still in Hexagom. So where is the other one?"

<b>

"Perhaps they went to pick some flowers?"

<b>

"Your boldness in saying that without changing your expression is impressive."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I am quite out of touch with the world, you know? I often hear that from those around me."

<b>

"Isn't that just insensitivity? I imagine everyone around you must be having a hard time."

<b>

"How rude of you. …I hope that's not actually the case. But truly, I am unaware of the world. In fact, I've never been south of Nasantorka County, let alone outside of Karais State."

<b>

"If that's the case, you might have the chance to see the wider world from now on."

<b>

"I would be delighted if that were the case. I heard there was a dress exhibition in the city of Yanuaris in the neighboring Granati State last month. I definitely want to see such things!"

<b>

"To think you have an interest in such ordinary things is surprising."

<b>

"How rude! I am an ordinary commoner girl, you know? Besides, Yanuaris is said to be the center of information dissemination! It's only natural that I want to visit at least once."

<b>

"Well, that city is indeed a place where trading companies gather, so it's not lacking in people or goods. It certainly has a side that serves as a source of trends."

<b>

<b>

"You have been to that city, haven't you?"

<b>

"I didn't say I've been there. Knowing about that city is common knowledge."

<b>

"Is that so? I thought you might know it well."

<b>

"I only know it within the range that everyone knows."

<b>

"…I see. That's unfortunate. I wanted to ask you something if you knew."

<b>

"By the way, what did you want to know?"

<b>

"Actually, a relative of an acquaintance has been out of contact for quite a long time in that city. I thought I would ask if you knew anything…"

<b>

"How could I possibly know such a thing? It's a common story that people who fail in business in that city go missing. Why would you think I would know?"

<b>

<b>

"I see, you don't know. I asked in desperation."

<b>

"I don't know."

<b>

"Is that so? That's unfortunate. Then, as a side note, just one more thing."

<b>

"I can't promise to meet your expectations."

<b>

"Do you know a person named Murdock?"

<b>

"…That name seems quite common."

<b>

"Gol Murdock… you know him, right?"

<b>

<b>

"…………It seems you are misunderstanding something, so let me correct one last thing."

<b>

"？…What is it?"

<b>

"The choice is ours, not yours. Do not forget that."

<b>

"I will keep that in mind."

<b>

<b>

"Now, we are about to arrive. Our enjoyable conversation ends here. It has been a very fruitful journey."

<b>

"That's wonderful. I also learned a lot. Thank you very much."

<b>

"…………You are quite the intriguing young lady. However, I am very curious to see how long that composure will last… heh heh…"

<b>

<b>

"Oh? You laugh like a snake. What a lovely true nature you have."
