# 175 - Meeting in a Car

Well, miss, we're off.

<blank>

"...... which way now, to?"

<blank>

What? It's just a drive.

<blank>

Then you can take off whatever you're wearing on your hands and feet.

<blank>

I'm a worrier. I worry that the carriage I've rented might be damaged."

<blank>

"Take this off, and you'll see that it's just a groundless fear, okay?"

<blank>

If you remove it, you're just going to scrap the carriage, aren't you?"

<blank>

It's ridiculous. What is a commoner's daughter doing?

<blank>

But I think these numbers are way out of line with the average person."

<blank>

"...... numbers?"

<blank>

<blank>

This is it. The numbers on the magic meter."

<blank>

The thing you just hit me in the forehead with is ......? Not the five seminal plates?

<blank>

Such an expensive object is not easy to carry around. When you hear the word "magic measuring instrument" and the five spirit discs come up, you are no longer a commoner, aren't you? It is not an item that the average person would be able to find.

<blank>

"............"

<blank>

This is a 'simple magic measuring device.' If the amount of magic is weak, less than 10, it will not respond to this. When someone is able to measure with this, they can apply to the temple to have the five spirit discs officially used. Didn't you know that?"

<blank>

............ seems a little out of touch with the world."

<blank>

It's okay," he said. The amount of your magic power is over 50. It is not a value that the average person can produce.

<blank>

"...... not normal, huh?"

<blank>

They say that magic is for everyone, but most people have only a little dust. Only a handful of people are able to have their magic power measured by the five seminal plates.

<blank>

<blank>

It may be a little different than what you think.

<blank>

How we perceive ourselves is unique to each of us. It is rare that there is no discrepancy between how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you."

<blank>

I am very aware of that. Where is this carriage headed at ......?"

<blank>

That's something you'll have to wait for when you get there," he said. But it will take some time to get to the destination. We'll have a good time chatting with you.

<blank>

I have been wondering about ...... since a while ago. Unlike his tone of voice in the basement, his cliched honorifics are very creepy. Are you making fun of me?"

<blank>

"Kuh-kuh-kuh! That's rude. I'm trying to treat you with respect.

<blank>

<blank>

If you have respect, you can remove these shackles in good faith, okay?"

<blank>

I have had my body checked to make sure I am not carrying any weapons," he said. But my gut says no to letting your daughter go free.

<blank>

I suggest you discard such useless intuition immediately. ...... What body check? Are you referring to the sexual harassment, by any chance?"

<blank>

I'm sorry you took it that way.

<blank>

Nothing but that! His nose should have been torn off!"

<blank>

"......, no way, what have you done?"

<blank>

I think I'm just being punished.

<blank>

I still think we should keep those shackles on.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"At ...... time we are now moving west or ...... northwestward from the city,?"

<blank>

May I ask why you think so?

<blank>

The light window in the basement was on the north side of the building. After leaving the basement, we went around the building, but the exit was on the south side. We got into the carriage and started driving in the west direction. The carriage went in a westerly direction and left the city, right? I knew I had left the city because I stopped at the gatekeeper's place. It was running on the East Canal Street for a little while, right? But I took a side road to the right just now. Is your destination one of the mountains to the northwest of Hexagom?

<blank>

I'm sure you'll be able to find it at ......! You are very observant. To be able to see that much with your eyes closed, you are even more unlike a commoner's daughter."

<blank>

It's because your eyes are closed that you can perceive it better, isn't it?"

<blank>

Let's put it that way.

<blank>

Since the head of the bandits went to the trouble of sending me, I look forward to seeing what kind of place I will be invited to."

<blank>

'I am not the head bandit, sir? Why on earth would you think that?"

<blank>

<blank>

Because of the way you were in the basement. The others were clearly in awe of you. Even when you were walking around the building, the people around you took a step back, didn't they?"

<blank>

I'm afraid I don't know how to do that. But I am sorry. I am a servant. I'm just a lowly man.

<blank>

You think the boss is somewhere else?

<blank>

That is correct."

<blank>

If you're not the boss, then what are you? It's very unnatural for a mere low-ranking employee to be so imposing, isn't it?"

<blank>

Well, how should I put it, a consultant? "Well, I'm sort of a consultant. But still, you are really paying close attention.

<blank>

I just like to observe people, you know? But I was feared a lot for a 'counselor,' wasn't I?

<blank>

'Good grief, does it look that way to you? But that's just my imagination. I am not the head of a band of thieves."

<blank>

<blank>

I see........., you're the 'organizer' of the bandits, huh? That makes sense.

<blank>

I'm sure you'd like to make me the leader of a band of thieves. I don't think that makes any sense at all, does it?"

<blank>

But then there are those who are using you, right? What kind of person is he? I'm curious.

<blank>

"...... how would you know something like that?"

<blank>

Are you a little angry? Did I say something to offend you? I'm just a little curious, that's all.

<blank>

You'd do well to learn to control it at all costs. Have you ever heard that curiosity can kill a cat?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Speaking of curiosity, there's something else I'm curious about.

<blank>

What now?

<blank>

"You wear those gloves with your fingers sticking out because you like that kind of thing, huh?"

<blank>

"...... what?"

<blank>

I know there are kids around me who like that kind of thing, too," he said. I'm sure it's nothing to be ashamed of at that age, you know. I'm sure you'll be fine, okay? I'm proud to say that I have a good understanding of such hobbies.

<blank>

'That's another big-hearted young lady. I envy the boys around you. But this is not a hobby of mine. It just happens.

<blank>

<blank>

I was wondering if there was a reason why you didn't cover your fingers with gloves when your hands were as cold as a dead man's." I was wondering if there is a reason why you don't cover your fingertips with gloves when your hands are as cold as a dead man's."

<blank>

'......Fingertip sensation is important. I'm just constantly sharpening those senses."

<blank>

I was wondering if you like that kind of thing, or if you have something you want to hide in your  hands. I thought maybe you liked that kind of thing, or maybe you have something you want to hide ...... in your hand.

<blank>

......, you're a young lady with some interesting things to say."

<blank>

I'm just asking because I'm a little curious, okay?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I see. ...... Oh, and speaking of curious, did you know that recently there have been rumors circulating that 'Roderick McGovern has adopted a distant relative's daughter and is trying to get her into the Bradley family, the head of Carnafraemel. ?"

<blank>

Well, that's a great story, isn't it?"

<blank>

Besides that, the street is full of rumors that the girl McGovern is now bringing to Hexagom is "actually a young mistress" and "an illegitimate child."

<blank>

Well! There are some very scandalous stories floating around, aren't there? I'm curious!"

<blank>

What are you doing," he said. "What are you doing, playing your voice like you're an out-of-touch onlooker? It's all about you, isn't it? McGovern's companion, the young lady.

<blank>

Oh? That's what it comes down to, huh?"

<blank>

'Who the hell is your daughter? And the world is wondering."

<blank>

The world is a very slow place, you know.

<blank>

<blank>

'There's another interesting piece of information,' he said. McGovern hired two sets of bouncers in DeKenvell. One group was made up of three men, rank 5, and they were McGovern's personal bodyguards. The other group is not high in rank, but is also an escort. Are you saying that they are your escorts? But you know, it's not right. According to our information, the other group also consists of three people, and two of them are still in Hexagom. Then, where is the other one?

<blank>

"I think they're out picking flowers, sir?"

<blank>

You have the audacity to say that without changing color.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm not very good at keeping up with world affairs, you know. I'm often told that by those around me.

<blank>

"I think you're being insensitive. I'm sure everyone around you is having a hard time."

<blank>

I hope that's not the case, but.... ......I hope that's not true, but I really don't know the world. But I really don't know the world. I've never been outside of the state of Calais, let alone south of Nasantorca County.

<blank>

Then maybe you'll get a chance to see the wider world in the future."

<blank>

I'd be happy if it were," he said. I heard that in the neighboring city of Yanuaris, Granati, there was a dress fair last month. I'd love to see something like that!

<blank>

I'm surprised you're interested in such a normal girl thing.

<blank>

I am really rude, aren't I? I'm just an ordinary girl. Besides, you say that Yanuaris is the center of information dissemination, don't you? Isn't it natural that you would like to visit there?

<blank>

Well, it is true that the city is a gathering place for trading companies, so there is no shortage of people and things to gather there. It certainly has an aspect of being a source of trends.

<blank>

<blank>

You've been in that town before, haven't you?

<blank>

I never said I had been there. It's part of my general knowledge of that city."

<blank>

"Is that so? I thought you knew him very well.

<blank>

I only know as much as anyone can know."

<blank>

I see that "....... I'm sorry to hear that. I would have asked you if you knew.

<blank>

What did you want to know, by the way?

<blank>

I have an acquaintance who has a family member in that city who has been out of touch for quite some time. I was wondering if you knew of any ......."

<blank>

How was I supposed to know that? It is a common story in that town that people who have failed in business disappear. What makes you think I would know?

<blank>

<blank>

I see, you don't know. I asked you because I was clinging to a straw.

<blank>

I don't know.

<blank>

This is Walter Miller, a man who disappeared four years ago. ............ really don't know him, do you?"

<blank>

I don't know.

<blank>

I'm sorry to hear that, "...... I see. Well, just one more thing, then. Just one more thing, by the way."

<blank>

I won't be able to meet your expectations."

<blank>

The Murdoch man. You don't know who Murdoch is, do you?

<blank>

I see that ...... is a common name."

<blank>

Gol Murdoch ...... you know, right?"

<blank>

<blank>

Let me correct one last thing, since you seem to have misunderstood ..................."

<blank>

?" ...... what is it, ?"

<blank>

You have a choice. You don't. Please do not forget that."

<blank>

I'll keep that in mind, okay?"

<blank>

<blank>

Now, it's time for us to arrive. So much for our pleasant chat. It has been a very rewarding journey.

<blank>

I am very glad to hear that. It was very useful for me, too. Thank you very much.

<blank>

I'm really looking forward to ............ seeing how long she can afford it. But I'm really looking forward to ...... seeing how far she can afford to go. Kukku......"

<blank>

<blank>

Oh?" You make a sound like a snake and you laugh, don't you? It's a very lovely nature, isn't it?"
