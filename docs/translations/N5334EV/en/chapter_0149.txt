# Chapter 137: Fluke's Nightmare

Bang! Crash!! Heavy sounds echoed repeatedly in the room.

It was the sound of Fluke kicking his desk in frustration.

<b>

<b>

That brat is really pushing it!

I went out of my way to assign three people to him, and yet they all got caught by the guards again—what kind of joke is this?!

This is beyond useless!!

<b>

<b>

Fluke was exploding with unprecedented anger at Parker, who had returned home shamefully instead of achieving results.

He continued to kick the desk with all his might, letting his anger overflow.

<b>

The guide who left Masuka behind, and the people of this country are utterly untrustworthy!

I smashed that idiot Parker's face in and broke his arms and legs.

I called out his female companion and toyed with her, but that wasn't enough to quell my anger.

For now, I'll let my subordinates use her downstairs, but by tonight, I'll drug her and drown her in the red-light district with other women.

Even then, it won't come close to making up for the losses! What a damn poverty god!!

<b>

“Damn it!!”

<b>

The sound of him kicking the desk echoed loudly in the room.

The two bodyguards standing by the entrance flinched at the sound.

<b>

But it was that insufferable young master who first ordered to meddle with that facility and the girl.

If only I could make him cover the losses...

<b>

“...I suppose I'll kidnap her tonight.”

“Y-Yes?”

<b>

Originally, I had planned to enjoy that girl tonight. But thanks to that unexpected brat, those plans went completely awry.

In the end, that's where the trouble began.

<b>

Then it's best to reset everything. If I proceed as planned, the fortunes will return.

<b>

“Gather the soldiers! Gather at least 10... no! 20!”

“Understood!”

“With that many, no matter how skilled that brat is, I should be able to snatch at least one of the girls when the opportunity arises.”

<b>

That's right, I should have just targeted the girls from the start. Trying to kidnap that little brat was utterly pointless.

I don't want to see that insane brat again, but that girl is worth more than ten soldiers!

Reinforcements are a necessary expense. I've decided to stick it to the young master and make him pay.

<b>

“Listen! We must kidnap that girl from the facility tonight—”

<b>

<b>

At that moment, Fluke's desk suddenly split in half with a loud crash.

<b>

The thick tabletop was made of expensive mahogany and was quite heavy.

It was something that could not be lifted by one person, let alone broken.

Yet now, it lay shattered before him.

Fluke was thrown off his chair by the impact and landed on the floor.

<b>

“Are you Fluke?”

<b>

At the sudden sound of a woman's voice, his body jolted in response.

There shouldn't have been anyone there just moments ago, yet a woman stood right in the middle of the shattered desk, looking down at him.

<b>

“I'm glad I came tonight after all.”

<b>

The woman wore a dress-like outfit made of leather.

It was clear at a glance that it was of high quality.

The sheen and color of the leather, the craftsmanship of the stitching—none of it seemed like something an ordinary person could acquire.

It was a piece that would be nearly impossible to obtain unless one were a powerful member of the old aristocracy.

<b>

But what truly caught his eye was the woman's appearance.

<b>

Her features were sculpted like a statue.

Her skin was a flawless, lustrous white, like porcelain.

Her emerald green eyes sparkled with light, resembling a clear sea.

<b>

And her hair.

It shimmered like a jewel, with a red brilliance that scattered like rubies with the slightest movement.

<b>

It was impossible not to be captivated.

<b>

Is it even permissible for someone like her to exist?

Fluke found himself unable to tear his gaze away from her stunning figure.

<b>

Even for someone like him, who had been with many women, he had never encountered anyone like this.

<b>

Yet at the same time, Fluke felt an overwhelming chill from the woman before him.

<b>

He was now facing a situation that was anything but normal.

A desk that should not have broken had shattered, he was sitting on the floor, and he couldn't comprehend the sudden appearance of the woman, leaving his mind in chaos.

<b>

Despite the confusion, for some reason, his mouth began to curl into a smile.

Faced with a situation so incomprehensible, his brain abandoned rational judgment and was unconsciously laughing.

<b>

<b>

“Fluke!!”

<b>

The two guards at the entrance shouted.

After being momentarily stunned by the sudden loud noise and the vibrations shaking the room, they finally rushed towards Fluke.

<b>

“What the hell? Where did you come from—”

<b>

One of the men leaped over the massive sofa in the center of the room, reaching out to grab the woman by her shoulder.

The other attempted to tackle her from the side to restrain her.

But in the next moment, both men suddenly vanished from Fluke's sight.

<b>

<b>

Fluke felt as if the air in the room had expanded.

Without delay, a loud vibration spread throughout the room, as if something had slammed against the walls.

<b>

“Huh?”

<b>

The large painting hanging on the wall was blown away, and the display rack filled with expensive liquor was shattered to pieces.

The two men had somehow become plastered against the walls on either side, slowly sliding down while leaving red stains behind.

Both of their limbs were bent at unnatural angles.

They had likely lost consciousness, but occasionally they would let out a “gurgle” as something spilled from their mouths. They were barely alive, as evidenced by their faint groans.

<b>

“There’s only you left here now.”

“...Huh? W-What did you say?”

“The men who were doing terrible things to the girls downstairs. I crushed two or three of their legs. And those who attacked without question, the ones who said, ‘They’re your comrades.’ I took care of all of them around and inside this building. There weren’t thirty of them, though.”

<b>

What is this woman saying?

Is she claiming she took out all the soldiers downstairs?

That’s ridiculous... there’s no way—

<b>

“Impossible...”

<b>

Fluke muttered with a half-smile.

However, when he saw the two men stuck to the wall, an involuntary gulp escaped his throat.

<b>

“I have no intention of going easy on pigs wearing human skin, but I’ll try not to kill you. If you do die, just consider it bad luck and give up.”

<b>

The woman cast a cold, merciless gaze.

In that instant, Fluke's nightmare began to unfold.
