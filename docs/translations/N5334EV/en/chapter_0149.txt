# 137 Fluke's Nightmare

Gun! GUN! and a heavy sound echoes repeatedly in the room.

It was the sound of Fluke kicking his desk in frustration.

<blank>

<blank>

That brat is a joke!

What the hell is the joke, I put three of them on him and they were all caught by the guards again?

It's not even close to useless!

<blank>

<blank>

Fluke was more angry than ever at Parker, who had come back dazed and dazed, rather than accomplish anything.

I let my anger overflow and continued to kick the desk with all my might.

<blank>

The guide who left Masuka behind, and the people in this country are really not to be trusted!

Parker's fool caved in his face and broke his limbs as well.

I called up his companion and tortured her, but that wasn't enough to settle my stomach yet.

Right now, he's downstairs with his crew, but tonight he'll be drugged and drowned with the other women in the red-light district.

But it's still not enough to make up for it! What a god of poverty!

<blank>

Fuck you!

<blank>

The sound of a desk kicking loudly echoed through the room.

The two bodyguards standing on either side of the entrance door shudder and their shoulders shake at the sound.

<blank>

But it was the obnoxious sergeant who first ordered me to mess with the facility and his daughter.

If you can get him to make up the loss, you can do so at .......

<blank>

...... still want to kidnap him tonight."

Yes?"

<blank>

Originally, I had planned to have fun with that girl tonight. But it was blown clean out of the water when the brat showed up, which I hadn't planned on.

In the end, that's where the stinginess begins.

<blank>

Then it's best to start over. If things go on as planned, the chance will come back to you.

<blank>

"Gather the troops, ten ...... no, scrape up twenty!"

Ha!"

No matter how good that brat is, he could snatch at least one of my daughters if he saw an opening.

<blank>

Yes, they should have targeted only the daughter from the beginning. It was completely pointless to try to get the little kid kidnapped.

I would hate to see myself as that crazy brat again, but that girl is worth more than 10 soldiers!

Filling in personnel is a necessary expense. I decided to blow it to the sergeant and let him have his ass.

<blank>

Listen to me! Make sure you kidnap my daughter from that facility by the end of tonight. ----"

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, the desk on which Fluke was sitting suddenly cracked in half and shattered with a loud noise.

<blank>

The thick top panel is made of expensive mahogany wood and is quite heavy.

It is not something that can be lifted by one person's strength, nor is it something that can be broken by any means.

It is now cracked in half and crushed in front of my eyes.

The impact caused Fluke to fall out of his chair and onto his buttocks on the floor before he knew it.

<blank>

You're Fluke, right?"

<blank>

The sudden sound of a woman's voice made my body react with a jerk.

There should have been no one there until now, but a woman stands in the middle of the room as if she had stepped on a broken desk and is looking down at us from there.

<blank>

I knew it was the right thing to do tonight.

<blank>

She's a woman dressed in what looks like a leather dress.

You can tell at a glance that it is a high quality product.

The luster of the leather and its hue. The sewing technique that creates it. It is hard to imagine that the average person can afford any of these things.

Even now, unless you are a powerful, upper-class former noble, you know that it is an impossible item to obtain first.

<blank>

But what really caught the eye was the woman's appearance.

<blank>

Statuesque, well-defined eyes and nose.

The skin is as clear and shiny white as porcelain.

His emerald green eyes are like the clear ocean, always full of light.

<blank>

And that hair.

The red jade sparkles like a jewel, and with the slightest movement, it dissipates and disappears around the area.

<blank>

It would be crazy if it didn't catch your eye.

<blank>

Is this the kind of woman we should have?

Fluke was so mesmerized by the sight that he couldn't take his eyes off it.

<blank>

Even though I have had many women in my life, I have never met anyone like this.

<blank>

But at the same time, Fluke also felt a frightening chill from the person in front of him.

<blank>

Now I find myself in a not-so-serious situation.

The desk, which would not normally break, is broken, I am on my butt on the floor, and the sudden presence of the woman is confusing my mind.

<blank>

I should be confused, but for some reason, my mouth is twitching up.

Faced with a situation that is so beyond comprehension, the brain abandons normal judgment and laughs unknowingly.

<blank>

<blank>

Mr. Fluke!

<blank>

Two of the guards at the entrance raised their voices.

The sudden loud noise and vibrations that shook the room temporarily knocked him out of his wits, but he finally ran to Fluke.

<blank>

What the fuck, man? Where did you come in?

<blank>

One of the men jumps over the huge sofa that is positioned in the middle of the room and stretches his arm toward the woman's shoulder in an attempt to pull her down.

The other one also attacks the woman's body from the side in an attempt to suppress her opponent's movement.

But the next moment, the two men had suddenly been scratched out of Fluke's sight.

<blank>

<blank>

The air in the room seemed to swell up in the fluke in front of me.

Without a pause, a loud vibration spread through the room as if something had been struck against the walls on either side.

<blank>

What about?"

<blank>

A large painting hanging on the wall was blown away, and a display rack of fine liquors, which had also been installed, was shattered.

The two of them are heaving against the wall on either side of it before long, slowly slipping off the wall, leaving a red stain as they are adsorbed to the wall by the cheaters.

Both had joints of their limbs pointing in strange directions.

He may be unconscious at the moment, but he occasionally spits something out of his mouth with a "goporir" sound. He is also moaning slightly, so we know that he has not stopped his vital activities.

<blank>

You're the only one here now.

I said, "What about ......? What, what?"

"The guys were doing terrible things to the girls downstairs. I smashed a couple of their legs. And the other guy who attacked me without asking me. I said, 'They're your guys. So, all of them, I guess, around and inside this building, there weren't 30 of them, right?

<blank>

What are you talking about? Who is this woman?

Is this guy saying that he came here by crushing all the soldiers who were under him?

That's impossible. ...... There's no way--

<blank>

Oh, that ain't possible. ......

<blank>

Fluke muttered with a half-smile.

But when I see the two of them stuck to the wall, I involuntarily choke up.

<blank>

I don't want to go easy on a pig in human skin, but I'm going to try not to die. If he still dies, I'll just give up and say it was bad luck.

<blank>

The woman drops her cold gaze ruthlessly.

At that moment, Fluke's nightmare began.
