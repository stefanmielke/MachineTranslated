# Chapter 87: Millia Castlerai Boarding School

Just barely made it in August—

----------------

<b>

<b>

“……Um, um… Nice to… meet you… please…”

<b>

It seems she finally managed to voice her words. After saying just that in a barely audible voice, the girl turned bright red and looked down.

<b>

On the night we entered the dormitory, the girl that the dormitory supervisor brought to our room introduced herself as Karen Merlin.

She had been delayed due to carriage troubles, which made her arrival at the academy happen at such a late hour.

Normally, one wouldn’t be able to enter the dormitory after the main gate closes, but it seems the dormitory supervisor made special arrangements, as they couldn’t just leave someone out at such a time.

I thought to myself that Mrs. Sheldon, while very strict, is actually a very kind person… and I couldn’t help but smile.

<b>

“It’s almost lights out. Please prepare for bed quickly.”

<b>

With that, she quietly left the room.

Yeah, it’s a bit scary when she maintains that smile without changing her expression! It really made me straighten my back, you know?!

<b>

I immediately brought Karen to the center of the room and had her sit on my bed.

I brewed some fresh tea and offered it to Karen, and it seemed she finally relaxed a bit.

She must be quite tired from the long journey and carriage troubles, so I hope this helps her unwind and rest properly.

<b>

Karen had tawny hair and large gray eyes that, despite being downcast, were beautiful and made her look very cute.

The fact that she wouldn’t meet my gaze while looking down might be because she’s being shy since it’s our first meeting?

Her blushing cheeks and fidgety demeanor seem to suggest that.

<b>

The kids from Amkam are all fearless and assertive, so this is a refreshing reaction.

Well, maybe this is the norm outside of Amkam!

<b>

After having tea, we introduced ourselves again, and it seemed she was indeed nervous. I felt Karen’s smile relax a bit.

Once she got into bed, perhaps feeling safe, Karen quickly began to breathe peacefully.

When she arrived, she looked completely worn out, so I felt relieved.

<b>

Honestly, I was quite nervous myself about who I would be sharing a room with at first… But I wonder if I can get along well with this person?

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

The Millia Castlerai Boarding School, where we will be spending our time from now on, is a well-known boarding school nationwide, with sister schools in several major cities, including the royal capital.

<b>

It is said to have been founded over 500 years ago.

Originally, it seems to have been something akin to a “terakoya” (temple school) in old Japan, providing education to the children of the villages near Dekkenbel, but eventually became a boarding school for the children of nobles and the wealthy to learn manners and culture.

And about 200 years ago, magical education was also incorporated, and research in that field became quite active.

<b>

In addition to the middle school building where we currently are, Millia Castlerai also has an elementary school building for children aged 6 to 14.

This is not entirely a boarding school; most of the children here live in Dekkenbel, and only those who have difficulty commuting from far away are said to live in the dormitory.

Furthermore, in addition to the elementary and middle schools, Millia Castlerai also has a university facility adjacent to it.

The standards of the magical university are on par with the Royal Capital’s Magical University, and it is said to have one of the top magical research facilities in the country.

<b>

High-quality foundational education. A body that trains skills alongside the mind. Advanced magical knowledge and the techniques to handle it correctly.

The “Millia Castlerai Magical Academy” is known as an educational institution that produces many excellent individuals under the school philosophy of “correctly passing on the knowledge and skills of our predecessors, using the power given to us for others, and always striving for growth to contribute to the world through our actions.”

<b>

<b>

<b>

Then, the week passed, and finally, the day came when we would officially become students of the academy.

That morning, all the new students were gathered in the auditorium for the entrance ceremony.

<b>

It was a ceremony where a representative stepped forward to declare, “We will learn based on the academy’s philosophy,” and the other new students followed suit in a pledge.

The one chosen as the representative to make the pledge was Beatrice Croki! Yes! Our Bibi!!

Bibi’s clear voice resonated loudly in the auditorium, and her dignified presence made me feel incredibly proud as her friend!

After finishing the pledge, Bibi returned to the line and gave us a small thumbs up. Yeah! You were amazing, Bibi!

<b>

<b>

However, the entrance ceremony was surprisingly simple, wasn’t it?

After the pledge ceremony, we moved to our assigned classrooms.

Each class has about 25 students, and the total number of students in a grade is over 100, with four classes.

My class is Group 1. There are four other students from Amkam in my class as well.

It seems that the first-year classes are assigned based on the region of origin. This is a remnant from when it was a noble boarding school.

So, I’m in a different class from Karen. When we left the auditorium, we waved goodbye to each other.

<b>

The ceremony ended quickly, but everyone seemed to be buzzing with excitement from having enrolled, and the classroom was still lively.

<b>

“Everyone, please be quiet!”

<b>

A voice echoed through the classroom. But while the voice was heard, the speaker was nowhere to be seen… What? Is this some kind of concealment magic?!

<b>

“Congratulations on your enrollment, everyone! For the next three years, let’s spend fulfilling times together at Millia Castlerai!”

<b>

As I searched for the source of the voice, I spotted a bundle of hair bouncing up and down behind the teacher’s desk! Is something there behind the desk?!

Eventually, when the bouncing hair settled down, its owner appeared in front of the teacher’s desk.

<b>

“I will be your… homeroom teacher for Group 1, my name is Ursula Ruin!”

<b>

She was a little girl!! No way, she looks like a child, right?!! And she’s the homeroom teacher?!! She looks no older than 10… she looks almost the same age as Annie?!

The bundle of hair that had been bouncing behind the desk was a topknot made from hair styled into a pompadour! It’s still swaying on her head!!

<b>

“Ah! Despite how I look, I’m already an adult! Inquiries about my real age are strictly prohibited! I won’t answer even if you ask!! By the way, I’m obviously human! I’ll be teaching ‘Fundamentals of Magic’ so I think I’ll be interacting with you all quite a bit!”

<b>

A little girl claimed to be an adult and our teacher! The classroom was in an uproar!!

<b>

A legal loli! A legal loli teacher!! How could the homeroom teacher for the new students be a legal loli teacher?! What kind of classic trope is this?!!!

If it were a long-lived race like dwarves or elves, I might understand… but a pure human?!!

Being a teacher of “Magic Theory” means! Could it be the result of using some unknown magic?!

<b>

“Now then! Please settle down! First, I’ll distribute your student IDs and textbooks, so please come to the front when your name is called! The first person is… Arvin Haggard-kun!!”

<b>

The little teacher… Ms. Ursula raised her voice to be heard over the classroom’s chatter.

Her original voice probably isn’t very loud… so she’s really trying hard to project her voice… Thinking about that, I felt a bit of a flutter in my heart.

When Arvin’s name was called, he seemed to understand and quickly went to the front to receive his student ID and textbooks.

If the first person takes too long, the others might follow suit and start dragging their feet. That would be unfair to the teacher who’s trying so hard!

<b>

The distribution of student IDs progressed quickly, and when it was my turn to step forward, the teacher looked at my student ID and then at me…

<b>

“……Ah, you must be Ms. Cloud… Please be gentle with me, okay?”

<b>

With a troubled yet shy smile, the teacher spoke in a small voice.

Huh? What? What does that mean?! Did I do something at school already? Huh?!

<b>

After distributing all the student IDs, the teacher briefly went over some important points about school life, explained the schedule for the following days, and then said that today’s session was over, leaving the classroom.

We were technically allowed to leave, but not many students exited immediately. It seems Ms. Ursula’s impact was quite strong. The classroom chatter continued.

<b>

Looking around the classroom now that the teacher was gone, I realized that while there were a few kids from other villages in Amkam, most were from unfamiliar places.

<b>

I need to manage my new relationships well from now on, but as someone who’s shy, I can’t help but feel a bit anxious about it! Yeah!

<b>

“Who’s shy, huh?!”

<b>

Huh?! What’s up, Bibi?! Did you just read my mind? Huh?! Do you have some kind of mind-reading skill or something?! Huh?!

<b>

“Why are you making such a surprised face?! I can’t read minds or anything!”

“Eh? Really? Then, why? Why? Huh?”

“Because you were making that kind of face! You’re really easy to read!”

“Eh? Is that so? Am I… easy to understand?”

“……Well, we’ve been through a fair bit together! I can kind of… understand you!”

<b>

Bibi turned her head away and said that. Algernon on Bibi’s shoulder seemed to chirp in agreement, tilting its head.

…So, I’m easy to read, huh… damn it.

Honestly, there’s no way you’re shy… I could hear Bibi muttering while turning her face away… damn it.

<b>

Well, whatever. For now, there’s something I need to make clear to this group of newcomers to ensure things go smoothly from here on out!

It’s important to make a strong first impression! I need to set the tone right from the start!!

<b>

I straightened my posture and stepped forward with a resolute attitude towards a certain spot in the classroom.

My shoes clicked quietly on the floor as I walked through the classroom filled with chatter.

<b>

It wasn’t a very large classroom, and I quickly reached my destination.

I quietly raised both hands in front of me.

<b>

“Huh? Su-chan? What’s wrong?!”

<b>

I stood quietly behind Mia, who had just stood up from her chair, slipped my hands under her arms, and then suddenly stretched my arms out, burying my fingers deep into the two massive masses there!!

<b>

“Su! Su-chan… Mmmph! Wh-what… is this?!”

<b>

Hah… as always, they’re too big to fit in my hands! I savor the size, weight, and softness to my heart’s content!!

<b>

“Hyah! Su-chan… wait! …Ah, my!!”

<b>

Heh heh heh… I see you, boys! I know what you’re looking at!! You all had your eyes glued to Mia’s chest since this morning, didn’t you?! Huh?! Take that!

<b>

“Wh-what?!!”

<b>

I know exactly where you’ve been looking since this morning!

And I know exactly what you were thinking while looking at this! I see through everything! Take that!!

<b>

“Stop it! Mmmph! W-what…!”

<b>

How’s that?! Are you jealous?! Are you jealous?! Wahahaha!! Take that!!

<b>

“Mmm! N-no! Stop…!”

“Wahaha! Wahahaha! Hahaha!”

“Enough already!!”

“Ugh!”

<b>

As I laughed heartily, Bibi rolled up one of the textbooks we received today and smacked me on the back of the head with it, delivering a perfect retort!

Ah! I got too caught up in the pleasant sensation in my hands, didn’t I?!

<b>

“What are you thinking?! You’re going to freak everyone out on the first day of school!!”

“……Su-chan…”

“Wha?!”

<b>

Mia turned to look at me.

Huh? What? Mia? There’s a shadow on your face? Huh? Is this bad? Did I go too far? Is there going to be… a counterattack? A counterattack is… coming, isn’t it?

That smile approaching me is scary?!

Ah! My waist is being grabbed! I-I can’t escape?!

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Excuse me!!!”

<b>

At that moment, the classroom door burst open with a bang, and a girl entered the classroom with a sound effect!

Of course, the three of us froze in surprise, and so did our classmates who were watching the situation, all turning their gazes toward the girl.

<b>

“I was told this is the classroom…”

<b>

Without flinching at the collective gaze of the class, the girl casually brushed her long hair aside with one hand and surveyed the classroom.

Whoa?! Is that blonde hair in ringlets?! This is the first time I’ve seen such a thing since coming to this world!! Isn’t she a classic noble girl character?! Now that I think about it, she has two attendants standing beside her, and they’re glaring at everyone around her!! This is definitely a noble lady character!! Exciting!!

<b>

“Is Beatrice Croki here?”

<b>

At the noble girl’s words, the three of us widened our eyes and exchanged glances.

But soon, Bibi snorted and brushed her hair aside with one hand, standing tall at the entrance of the classroom to face the noble girl.

“I’m Beatrice Croki! And who might you be?!”

<b>

Bibi stood with her hands on her hips, facing the noble girl without backing down. Whoa… as expected of Bibi! So reliable!!

<b>

“……Is that you?”

<b>

The noble girl raised an eyebrow slightly and glared at Bibi.

Whoa! I feel like sparks are flying in the air as Bibi and the noble girl’s gazes clash!

<b>

“You! You’ve been called a genius born once every twenty years, haven’t you? You’re getting a bit too full of yourself, aren’t you?!”

“Excuse me?”

“Your top entrance exam score! It was just luck, wasn’t it?!”

<b>

With all her might, the noble girl pointed her finger directly at Bibi, leaning back slightly as she declared that!

<b>

“After all, it was just a fluke! A mere coincidence! You just happened to have good intuition, didn’t you?! Such luck won’t happen twice!! Don’t you dare forget that!!”

“……………”

“Such miracles won’t happen again! Yes! I won’t let that happen again!! Don’t expect to receive such honors as a representative again in the future! Prepare yourself!!”

<b>

The noble girl’s tension was through the roof! The two attendants beside her were nodding along, as if agreeing with her?!

<b>

“Today, I came to inform you of that!”

<b>

As if to say, “You should be grateful!” she snorted and flicked her hair aside once more.

<b>

Hmm, Bibi scored the top marks in the entrance exam based on a combination of written, physical, and magical ability tests! She was incredibly dignified during the pledge, and as her friend, I felt very proud, and as a member of Amkam, it was something to be proud of.

But it seems that this noble girl didn’t take too kindly to that?

<b>

“……So?”

“Eh?”

<b>

After saying what she wanted to say, the satisfied noble girl was met with a cold response from Bibi.

At Bibi’s attitude, the noble girl’s eyebrow twitched.

<b>

“Excuse me! But you haven’t answered my question about who you are?!”

<b>

At Bibi’s question, the noble girl opened her eyes wide for just a moment but quickly narrowed them, wearing a defiant smile.

<b>

“……Oh, I apologize for that. I am Cordelia Kaspar from Boltusnan. Please remember my name.”

<b>

The lady who introduced herself as Cordelia smiled lightly while hiding her mouth with a fan she took out.

Whoa! A fan! That’s so stylish! Isn’t it a must-have for noble ladies?! Where did she pull that from?!!

<b>

“Thank you for your polite greeting.”

<b>

Bibi lightly grasped her skirt and performed a curtsey in response to Cordelia.

The three facing her nodded in satisfaction at Bibi’s gesture.

<b>

“Cordelia, the daughter of the former count family of Boltusnan, has come all this way. We are truly honored.”

<b>

Whoa! A former count family, huh?!

Wait, she’s really a noble lady! A genuine countess! Amazing!!

Still, Bibi seems to know a lot. As expected, she’s always been involved in social gatherings. Her tone is different from her usual strong demeanor, adopting a quiet and modest attitude! That’s impressive too?!

Cordelia and her two attendants looked satisfied, as if to say they expected this. Hmm, that’s impressive.

<b>

“Cordelia-sama’s greeting seems to have particularly pleased our next head of Amkam. Thank you very much!”

<b>

Huh?! What? What are you saying, Bibi?!

<b>

As Bibi said that, she took a step back and stood next to me.

Mia also moved to my left side.

Both of them stood a step back, as if they were my attendants? And both of them had defiant smiles on their faces?!

<b>

“This is Suzy Cloud, the daughter of the former border count of Amkam, our next head!”

<b>

Whoa?! 

<b>

“Th-the next head…? But, but a mere border count…”

“C-Cordelia-sama! A border count is equivalent to a marquis. Especially the authority of the Amkam border count was said to be greater than that in the past…”

“!?…Ugh!…Huh!!”

<b>

Bibi was making some grand claims?! Thanks to that, the atmosphere became quite strange!!

And the girl beside Cordelia whispered something in a small voice, further thickening the air?!

I-I need to do something about this!!

For now, let’s at least greet her! Yeah! I should do that!!

<b>

With that in mind, I reached for my skirt to perform a curtsey like Bibi, but she stopped my hand!

Huh?! Why?

When I looked at Bibi, she was signaling me not to.

<b>

Ugh… I guess I have no choice! I’ll just smile and brush it off!

For now, I’ll tilt my head like usual and smile brightly!!

<b>

“I-I’m Suzy Cloud… Nice to meet you… okay?”

“Ah… uh… I-I’ll take my leave for today!!”

<b>

Cordelia’s face turned bright red with a rush, and her eyes were spinning?

Before I could even ask if she was okay, she and her two attendants dashed out of the classroom.

Just like when they entered, they left in a flashy manner.

<b>

“Alright! We won!”

<b>

Bibi clenched her fist as if to say Yes!

<b>

Why are you fighting?!

I’d rather not have this kind of battle!!

<b>

----------------

Thank you for always reading!

<b>

<b>

I thought it was unacceptable for the homeroom teacher not to show up on the first day of school, so I added this.
