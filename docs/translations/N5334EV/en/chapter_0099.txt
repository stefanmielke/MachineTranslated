Just in time for August!

"............ Oh, um, ....... Yo, yo ...... please ......, o-one, onegai ...... shimasu."

<blank>

I guess she finally got her voice out. After saying that much in a muffled voice, the girl turned bright red and turned her head down.

<blank>

On the night we entered the dormitory, the dorm supervisor brought her to the dorm room and she told us her name was Karen Merlin.

They were delayed due to carriage problems and arrived at the school at such an early hour.

Normally, students are not allowed to enter the dormitories after the main gate is closed, but it seems that the dorm supervisor has arranged for them to be locked out at this hour.

I couldn't help but smile at the thought that this Mrs. Sheldon is a very kind person, even though she is very harsh .......

<blank>

It will be lights out soon. Get ready for bed as soon as possible.

<blank>

After saying this, he quietly left the room.

Yeah, it's a little coy if you let your smile go through without changing your expression! I've grown a bit taller after all, haven't I?

<blank>

He immediately brought Ms. Cullen to the center of the room and had her sit on his bed.

I made a fresh pot of tea and offered it to Karen, who seemed to finally be able to catch her breath and calm down.

I hope they will be able to relax and take a good rest after the long trip and the carriage trouble.

<blank>

Karen was a very pretty person with beautiful steeple-colored hair and downcast but large gray eyes.

Is it because we have not yet met, or is it because he is still reserved?

I think his cheeks are tinted and his restless demeanor says otherwise.

<blank>

This is a bit of a new reaction, since the Amcam kids are all so fearless and headstrong.

Well, outside of Amcam, this is probably the norm!

<blank>

After tea, we introduced ourselves to each other again, and I knew she was nervous. Karen's smile seemed to have relaxed somewhat.

Perhaps relieved to be in bed, Karen immediately began to sleep soundly.

It's a relief, because when I came, I was feeling exhausted.

<blank>

To be honest, at first I was quite scared of the kind of person I would be sharing a room with. ...... But I thought, "I can get along with this person.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

The school where we will be staying, Milia Castel Eye Boarding School, is a boarding school with sister schools in several large cities, including King's Landing, and is well known throughout the country.

<blank>

Its founding is said to be over 500 years old.

Originally, it was a kind of "terakoya" in old Japan to educate the children of the villages in the vicinity of Dekenber, but it eventually became a boarding school for the children of aristocrats and wealthy families to learn etiquette and culture.

About 200 years ago, magical education was introduced, and research into this field began to flourish.

<blank>

In addition to the secondary school where we are now, Miria Castellai also has a primary school for children from 6 to 14 years old.

Most of the children live in De Kembel, but only those from far away who have difficulty attending school live in the dormitories.

Furthermore, in addition to these primary and secondary buildings, Miria Castel Eye also has a university facility adjacent to it.

The standard of the university is no less than that of the King's College of Magic, and it has facilities for magical research that are among the best or second best in the country.

<blank>

A high standard of basic education. A body that trains the mind and the body that trains the mind and the body. Advanced knowledge of magic and the skills to handle it correctly.

The "Milia Castel Eye Academy of Magic" is known as an educational institution that produces many talented individuals under the philosophy of "to pass on the knowledge and skills of our predecessors, to use the power we have been given to others, and to contribute to the world through our actions while always striving to grow. The school is now known as an educational institution that has produced a large number of excellent human resources.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The week opened, and finally the day came when we became official students of the school.

First thing that morning, all new students were gathered in the auditorium for the entrance ceremony.

<blank>

In the pledge ceremony, one representative steps forward and takes the oath of office, saying, "I will study based on the principles of the school," followed by the other new students.

Beatrice Kroki was chosen as the representative and took the oath of office in front of the crowd! That's right! It's our Bibi!

Bibi's clear voice rang out loud and clear in the auditorium, and his imposing presence made me proud of him, even though he is my friend!

Bibi gives us a small thumbs-up as she returns to the lineup after taking the oath of office. Yeah, that was great, Bibi! That was great, Bibi!

<blank>

<blank>

But was the entrance ceremony a lot less assorted than I thought it would be?

After the swearing-in ceremony, the students moved to their classified classrooms.

Each class has about 25 students, and the total number of students in a grade is about 100, with four classes.

My class is class 1. In my class, there are four other students from Amcam with me.

Apparently, in the first grade, classes are assigned by region of origin. This is said to be a remnant from the days when the school was a boarding school for aristocrats.

So Karen and I are in different classes. As we left the auditorium, we waved to each other, "See you later," and headed to our respective classrooms.

<blank>

The ceremony went off without a hitch, but the classroom was buzzing with excitement, as if everyone was elated to have been admitted to the school.

<blank>

Everyone, please be quiet!"

<blank>

Someone's voice echoed through the classroom. But although the voice is heard, the figure is not seen. ...... What is this? Is this some kind of cover-up magic?

<blank>

Congratulations on your enrollment! Congratulations on your enrollment! For the next three years! Let's make the most of the next three years here at Milia Castel Eye together!

<blank>

If you looked for the source of the voice, you could see a strand of hair flopping and flopping across the podium! Is there something behind the podium?

Eventually, when the bouncing strands of hair fell silent, as if they had given up, the main body appeared in front of the podium.

<blank>

My name is Ursula Lewin, and I will be your ...... homeroom teacher for this first class!

<blank>

It was a little girl! How could it be a little girl who came out of the room? And that's her homeroom teacher? No matter how you look at it, she looks no different from Annie, who is no more than 10 years old,......!

The strands of hair that were bouncing behind the podium were chompers made from hair that I had put together into a pompadour! It's still bobbing on my head!

<blank>

Oh, I'm an adult! I'm already an adult, you see! Prying about my actual age is included in the prohibited items! I can't answer even if you ask! By the way, of course, I am a human being! I'm in charge of [Basic Magical Doctrine], so I'm sure I'll be in contact with many of you!

<blank>

The little girl is a homeroom teacher and she told me she is an adult! The classroom is in an uproar!

<blank>

I'm a legit loli! It's a legit Lolita teacher! What an ironclad, legal Lolita teacher is the homeroom teacher for the new students!

I thought I could still understand if it was a long-lived species like dwarves or elves, but ...... pure human, oh?

A teacher of "magical doctrine"? Is it the result of using some unknown magic?

<blank>

Well..! It's time for you to quiet down! First of all, I'll be handing out student ID cards and textbooks quickly, so please come to the front to get them from the person whose name is called! The first person to get their name called will be ......, Mr. Irving Haggard!

<blank>

The young girl teacher ...... Ursula teacher was raising her voice to keep up with the buzz in the classroom.

I guess your voice was never that loud to begin with ......, that's why you're trying so hard to sound so loud ....... When I think about it, I feel a kind of squeaky thing.

Irving, who had been called by name, also recognized this and immediately stepped forward to receive his student ID card and textbooks.

If the first one is lazy, the ones who follow will be lazy too. It would be a pity for the teachers who are working so hard, wouldn't it?

<blank>

The distribution of student ID cards proceeded like that, and when it was my turn, I stepped forward and compared my name on my student ID card with mine. ......

<blank>

"...... Oh, you are Mr. Cloud? ....... Please be gentle with me, okay?"

<blank>

The doctor said in a small voice with a troubled, bashful smile on his face.

What? What? What do you mean? Did I already do something wrong at school? What?

<blank>

After handing out all the student ID cards, the teacher gave a brief reminder about school life, explained the schedule for tomorrow and thereafter, and said that today was the end of the day.

I was told that I could go home now, but not many students left the classroom immediately. I guess Mr. Ursula had a strong impact on them. The class was still in an uproar.

<blank>

Looking around the classroom without the teacher, I realize once again that although there are some children from other villages in Amkamu County, most of them are from places I don't know .......

<blank>

I have to get along with new people from now on, but as a shy person, I feel a little uneasy about it! I know!

<blank>

Who's shy?

<blank>

What? What's with you, Bibi? Did you just read someone's thoughts? Huh? You have mind-reading skills or something? What?

<blank>

Why do you look so surprised? I can't read your mind!"

What? Huh? Then, then, hey, why? Why? What?

Because you look like that! You're so obvious!"

"Oh? Oh, really? Am I... easy... to... understand?"

"...... Well, well, I've been there and done that! I can ...... understand that in its own way!"

<blank>

Bibi pouted and turned to the side and said something like that. Algernon squeaks and tilts his head at Bibi's shoulder, as if to say, "Yes.

......Well, I'm easy to understand. ......Chikuso.

In general, there is no reason for you to be shy,...... and I could hear Bibi muttering to himself as he turned away from me,.......

<blank>

Oh well. First of all, I have to let these first-timers know that I'm not going to let them down if we're going to get along!

The first time is the crucial time! You have to get it right the first time!

<blank>

I straightened my posture and stepped resolutely toward where the classroom was located.

In the noisy classroom full of chatter, my shoes click quietly on the floor.

<blank>

In the classroom, which was not very large, I was able to reach the desired location quickly.

I raise my hands silently in front of me.

<blank>

Huh? Sue? What's the matter with you?

<blank>

I stood quietly behind Mia, who had just risen from her chair, slipped my hands in behind her sides, and stretched my arms out at once, burying both of my fingers in the two huge masses there as deep as I could!

<blank>

Sue! Sue-chan ...... nmmu! Nah, na......yinnyunmuooooooo!"

<blank>

......, as usual, is too large to fit in my hand! I can fully enjoy its size, weight, and softness with my palms!

<blank>

I'm not sure what to say! Suu, Suu-chan, ...... wait a minute! It's ......! Aaamyu!

<blank>

Phew phew phew phew ...... you're looking at me, men! I know what I'm talking about! You guys! You've had your eyes glued to Mia's coco from the start today, right? Yeah? Urya!

<blank>

"Nneeaaaah?!!!!"

<blank>

It's completely obvious where you guys have been looking all morning!

What's more! I can see everything! I can see everything! Oh, my God!

<blank>

I'm like, "Chooo...... nnnn! Mooooooooooo!"

<blank>

But too bad! This is..! This treasure is mine! Oh, wow! 

<blank>

I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! I'm going to go to ......!

<blank>

What do you think? Are you jealous? Are you jealous? Wahahahaha! Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！

<blank>

Nnnn! Nnnn! I'm going to go to ......, mooooooooo! Nnnn!

Wahahahaha." Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

Enough!

"Oof!"

<blank>

I was laughing so hard that Bibi rolled up the textbook we had been handed out today and gave it to me with a clean slap, just like a HARISEN! I was so happy to see him!

Ha! Was I too absorbed in the comfort I felt in my palms?

<blank>

What are you thinking? The first day of school and everyone in the class is going to be so disappointed!"

"............ Sue-chan ......"

Huh?

<blank>

Mia turned here with a swaying look.

Oh, hey? Mia? You have a shadow on your face. Oh, that? Is it bad? Is it bad? Did I get too carried away? Counterattack? Counterattack is coming... ......?

The smiling faces that approach me are scary!

Ha! He held me by the waist! Can't I escape?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

We're sorry to disturb you!

<blank>

At that moment, the classroom door was opened vigorously and bam!　and a female student entered the classroom, as if carrying a sound effect.

The three of us, as well as our classmates who had been watching what was going on, froze at this sudden turn of events and involuntarily turned our attention to the female student.

<blank>

I was told it's a classroom here: ......

<blank>

Unafraid of the stares of the entire class, the girl shook off her long, frizzy hair with one hand and looked around the classroom.

Ooooh? Blonde hair in vertical rolls? I've never seen that before in this world! Isn't she a proper young lady? Come to think of it, there's one female student on each side of her, just like a chaperone! They're throwing menacing glances at the people around them! She's a courtesan! She's a daughter character! I'm going up!

<blank>

"Beatrice Croquis! Is she here?"

<blank>

The three of us looked at each other with wide-open eyes when the young lady said that.

But immediately, with a sniffle, Bibi also shook off her shoulder-length hair with one hand and turned her attention to the young lady standing at the entrance of the classroom.

<blank>

I am Beatrice Kuroki. Who are you?

<blank>

Bibi put her hands on her hips and faced the young lady in a nioi stance, seemingly not taking a step back from her opponent. I'm sure you can count on me! I'm not sure what to do with it, but I'm sure it will work!

<blank>

"...... is that you?"

<blank>

The young lady wiggled one eyebrow and glared at Bibi.

Oooh! I can feel sparks flying in the air as Bibi and Lady's gazes collide!

<blank>

You, you're the only one in 20 years who doesn't come out of the woodwork with a big heart!

Yes?"

"I was just lucky to get in! You were just lucky to get in!

<blank>

Dobishii! The young lady said to Bibi with her fingers extended as far as they would go, thrusting them as hard as she could in front of Bibi's face, her body almost bending over!

<blank>

It's just a fluke! It's just a coincidence of the stars! It's the result of a lucky guess, isn't it? Such coincidences don't happen twice! Please do not forget that!

".................."

'Such a miracle will never happen again! Yes! I will not let it happen! The honor of being a champion will never come again! Prepare yourself!

<blank>

The daughter is really excited! And the two on either side of her are nodding their heads in agreement!

<blank>

I'm here today to tell you about it!"

<blank>

Thank God for that! He sniffed and waved off the blonde roll again with one hand!　and swept the blonde roll away again with one hand in a flurry.

<blank>

Hm, Bibi passed the entrance exam with first place in the written, physical, and magic tests! He was so majestic when he took the oath, and as a friend, I was really proud of him, and as a fellow AMCAM member, I was also very proud of him.

But I guess that didn't sit too well with this young lady?

<blank>

"............, so?"

What about?"

<blank>

Bibi threw a cold remark at the satisfied young lady, who seemed to have said all she wanted to say.

Bibi's attitude causes the daughter's eyebrows to raise.

<blank>

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure who you're talking about! I asked you who you are! You have not answered my question!

<blank>

At Bibi's question, her eyes widened for a moment, but then she immediately narrowed them and smiled wryly.

<blank>

I am from Boltusnan and my name is Cordelia Casper. My name is Cordelia Casper and I am from Boltsunan. I am Cordelia Casper from Boltzunan and look forward to getting to know you.

<blank>

The person, who introduced herself as Ms. Cordelia, lightly bobbed her head and quickly hid her mouth, which had a small smile on it, with a fan she had taken out.

Oooooh! Fan! You have good taste, don't you? It's a must-have for a young lady character, isn't it! I mean, where did you get that from?

<blank>

This is a very polite greeting, and much appreciated.

<blank>

Bibi picked up her skirt a bit and returned the greeting to Miss Cordilia with a curtsey of lightly bent knees.

The three people facing him nodded in satisfaction at the sight of Bibi.

<blank>

"Boltzunan, the former Countess herself has graciously agreed to join us."

<blank>

Ho! You are an old countess?

I mean, she's really a princess, isn't she? A real countess! Amazing!

By the way, Bibi knows his stuff. I'm surprised that she always takes care of me at social gatherings. Her tone of voice is quiet and modest, unlike her usual strong one! Isn't this one amazing?

Miss Cordelia and her two attendants were nodding their heads in satisfaction, as if they should know. Wooom, I knew it was amazing.

<blank>

The next head of AMCAM seems exceptionally pleased with the greeting from Ms. Cordelia. Thank you, sir!

<blank>

What? What? What did you say? Bibi?

<blank>

Bibi says this and takes a step back and takes a standing position beside me.

Even Mia came up to my left side.

They are both standing one step back on either side of me, so it looks like they are my followers, right? I mean, are they both smiling with a wry smile on their mouths?

<blank>

This is Suzy Cloud, the daughter of the former Countess of Amkham, our next head of state.

<blank>

Oooooooooooooooooooooooo?

<blank>

Ji, the next head of ......? But! It's only a frontier count, etc. ......"

'Coco, Lady Cordelia! A frontier count is equal to a marquis. In particular, the authority of the Count of the Frontier of Amkham was said to be even more than that in the past. ......"

! ...... Blowfish! ...... mmm, mmm!!!"

<blank>

Bibi is blowing a lot of big words! It's making the atmosphere a little strange!

The air became even heavier when the girl by Miss Cordelia's side whispered in a low voice, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

This is something I have to do!

Let's just say hello for now! Yeah! Let's do it!

<blank>

So I reached for my skirt to do carte blanche like Bibi, but Bibi stopped me!

What? Why?

When he sees Bibi, he says no with his eyes.

<blank>

Oooooh yeah ...... I can't help it! Let's just laugh at this and fool ourselves!

At any rate, let's just tilt our heads and smile like we always do!

<blank>

"Su, Suzy Cloud, it's ....... Nice to meet you, please... right?"

Oh ...... oh ...... oh! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry for today!

<blank>

Miss Cordelia's face is turning red with vigor. ...... Are her eyeballs glazed over, too?

Are you all right? Before I had time to ask, the three of us ran out of the classroom in a flurry of butterflies.

He is just as flamboyant when he exits as he was when he arrived.

<blank>

I'm going to go to the gym and try to get some sleep! I won!"

<blank>

Bibi clenched his fist as if to say Yes!

<blank>

Why are you fighting?

I just don't want these fights!



<blank>

----------------

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

<blank>

I added this because I knew that homeroom teachers don't appear on the first day of school. ......
