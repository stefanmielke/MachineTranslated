# Chapter 143: Each Night, Part 3 (In the Case of Dalton Banjo)

"Chairman, excuse me."

<b>

Anna Mary Vailos stepped into the academy chairman's office, opening the thick door.

<b>

"I hear the investigation is going well. I'm glad you came. It's a big help."

"Thank you very much."

"So? I heard you have an urgent report?"

"Yes, just now, we received a report from our family and the Edgarla family's spies."

"Oh?"

"Just a moment ago, our young lady has! Decimated the enemy forces!!"

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"Our... my! Lady Suzy has single-handedly defeated approximately 220 enemy forces at Dekkenbel!!"

"Wait, can you hold on a second?"

"I was so eager to convey the young lady's great achievement as soon as possible!"

"Can we calm down a bit? Anna Mary Vailos."

"I rushed here without taking anything with me!"

"Yes, yes, I understand your loyalty to Lady Suzy."

"Of course! My feelings for my lady have already surpassed the heavens."

"That's wonderful. But can you let me organize the information a bit?"

"Yes, of course."

"First, the lady you hold in such high regard, Suzy Cloud."

"Yes!"

"She is currently, at this time, just past 10 PM, out of the dormitory... is that correct?"

"……Now, what are you talking about?"

"She was out, so her great achievement was accomplished, right?"

"I apologize. I don't quite understand what you mean."

"Oh—, yeah, I see. This is going to be a parallel line of conversation."

"I’m sorry again. I still can’t quite grasp what you’re saying."

"Okay, I get it. We can't move forward like this. Let's leave that for now."

"…………"

"Suzy Cloud is not out tonight... no, that's not right... She has permission to be out. It's late, but the gatekeeper will certainly testify that she has come and gone. I, Dalton Banjo, chairman of the Millia Castle Eye Academy, guarantee that. How about that?"

"I believe that is a wise judgment."

"That's good to hear. Now we can move forward with the conversation. So? What did she destroy?"

"She destroyed various small and large bases located in the citizen areas 5, 6, and 8, as well as the old city areas 12, 9, 7, and 6. Each of them had hidden rooms and safes, but they were all reportedly destroyed."

"Seven bases? That's quite a lot more than we were aware of... Did you guys from Amkam provide that information?"

"No, I believe it was based on the lady's own investigation."

"In just a little over an hour? If that's the case, that's incredible."

"Exactly! The lady is far beyond our common sense!!"

"Yeah, that's really true. So? There were safes in the hidden rooms as well?"

"Yes, the lady only destroyed the doors of the safes, so the contents remain untouched. Currently, members of the Edgarla family are collecting them, and members of the Vailos family are examining them."

"…So that means, the things we desire?"

"Perhaps they will be sufficiently gathered."

"Thank you. That was amazing information. …But how could she accomplish that in such a short time?"

"The lady simply advanced and brushed away the pests that approached her."

"I see, so she truly is extraordinary beyond measure, as the rumors say."

"Exactly."

"But thanks to that, it seems we can significantly accelerate our plans."

"Lord Philip thinks the same."

"I'll have you prioritize that examination as well. How long do you think it will take to wrap it up?"

"If we can muster all our strength, we would need about a week..."

"Okay, I see. Timing-wise, if we coordinate with Mr. McGavin from the North Milia Trading Company, we might be able to take another step."

"I believe that is possible."

"Also, I think we'll need to borrow Lady Suzy's hand again."

"The lady's success is something we also wish for."

"That was the stance of Amkam for the time being. So, I'll be counting on you then."

"Understood."

"That means the upcoming X-Day is likely to be set before mid-next month. But if that's the case, it might be unfortunate for Mr. Cloud's daughter..."

"No, rather, if she knows she has been excluded from such an event, the lady may sulk."

"Is that so? I wonder how that would go... But if possible, I might ask for it."

"Then I will also arrange that timetable."

"Please do. Now, I need to send a message to Bona."

"By pigeon, I presume?"

"Yes, he must be looking forward to it. It's sudden, but I think he can prepare to come here in about half a month."

"We will proceed in that direction as well."

"Thank you. Now we finally have a prospect. …I don't think avenging their enemies will be a form of atonement for her, but still, we have no intention of forgiving him. …We know this is just self-satisfaction for us, right?"

"I believe you should act as you see fit. For Amkam, enemies of our kin are still enemies."

"After being away from the path for over a hundred years, those are truly appreciated words. Can you convey my gratitude to the head?"

"Understood. Now, I will begin the examination of the information that has started to gather, so I will take my leave."

"Yes, please do. Also, please convey my regards to Lady Suzy, that I am grateful."

"Yes, I will do so subtly."

"Yes, subtly."

"Then, I will take my leave."

<b>

After Anna Mary exited, Dalton Banjo took out a pigeon and began to dictate a message to his friend.

<b>

As he spoke, he recalled the friends who were no longer present, and his eyes, which were slightly sleepy, softened gently.

He had intended to only include the schedule, but before he knew it, there was a gentle recounting of memories in his demeanor.
