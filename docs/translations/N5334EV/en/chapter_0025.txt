There are cruel depictions. Please be cautious if you are sensitive to such content.

It swayed its colorless white hair gently.

The cerulean blue eyes, reminiscent of the cold, looked down upon and mocked everything but itself.

With a mouth devoid of color, it twisted its lips and raised the corners.

<b>

It appeared to be around 10 years old.

Wearing a black outer garment and a white shirt.

On its chest, it adorned a frilled jabot typical of nobility, at the center of which a gem of the same color as its eyes emitted light.

Furthermore, colorful gems peeked out from around its neck through the gaps in the outer garment.

<b>

What looked like a still innocent boy was lifting a girl.

The girl appeared to be around 12 or 13 years old, somewhat larger than the boy, but he lifted her effortlessly, with only his left hand resting on her waist.

<b>

The girl, held by the waist, arched backward, her eyes wide open as she stared into the void, tears streaming down her face.

Her lips trembled, bloodless, as she repeatedly murmured words of forgiveness.

<b>

The white-haired boy looked down at the girl’s figure with delight.

As he whispered something in her ear, the girl widened her eyes further, attempting to scream, but no sound came out.

Even as she tried to escape, it was as if she were bound by an invisible restraint, unable to move even slightly.

<b>

The girl's eyes became stained with despair, her mouth opened and closed meaninglessly.

The boy took the girl’s left hand and brought it close to his mouth, gently kissing it.

<b>

Then, he slowly tightened his grip on the girl’s hand.

A crack echoed as her bones creaked.

The girl widened her eyes even more, mouthing "stop," but no words came out.

<b>

Eventually, a dull sound like multiple small branches breaking resonated through the room.

The girl overflowed with tears, trying to scream from the depths of her throat, but only the sound of air escaped.

Her pained voice did not emerge.

<b>

The boy tilted his head, observing the girl’s expression with delight, further distorting his mouth.

<b>

As if intermittently screaming, air was squeezed out of the girl’s mouth.

<b>

The boy held the girl’s hand and slowly twisted her arm in the opposite direction of the elbow joint.

A light crack echoed, and the girl’s arm bent in a direction it should not have.

<b>

<b>

The girl opened her throat further and screamed, but only a more forceful rush of air escaped than before.

The inability to produce sound intensified her suffering.

Tears flowed endlessly from her wide-open eyes, and her pupils trembled slightly.

<b>

Sensing that the girl was losing her sanity, the boy deepened his smile.

He released the girl’s arm and grabbed her forehead with his right hand.

<b>

<b>

The boy’s fingernails were sharp like those of a carnivorous beast.

He dug his nails into the girl’s temple, pulling her head down to expose her throat.

The girl’s eyes quivered with even more fear.

<b>

The boy slowly bit into the girl’s throat.

As if sinking his teeth into a prime fruit…

The girl’s body stiffened and convulsed with pain and fear unlike anything she had experienced before.

<b>

The boy’s eyes changed from a cold blue to a blood-like red, glowing ominously.

<b>

Before long, the color drained from the girl’s body, turning it waxy white.

Eventually, the vitality disappeared from her eyes, and her body lost its strength, losing its appearance as a living being.

<b>

The boy pulled his mouth away from the girl’s throat and discarded her body as if throwing away an empty drink can.

He moved his mouth, and from it, he extracted a gem the size of a pinky nail, placing it on his tongue, resembling a lump of blood.

<b>

“Hmm—, the color isn’t good, and there’s a lot of cloudiness.”

<b>

He returned it to his mouth once more, playing with it as if it were a candy.

<b>

“The taste is bland… Is the material not good? A brash country girl like this is about all I can expect.”

<b>

Something began to stir in the shadows of the room.

<b>

“Oh, it’s fine. Even if I leave it to its last breath, it’ll die soon enough. Just get rid of it quickly.”

<b>

<b>

As if waiting for those words, something leaped out from the shadows and clung to the girl’s body.

<b>

It had a human-like form, but its snout protruded, and its mouth was split wide open, filled with vicious fangs.

Several creatures, resembling a beast or a human with such a crocodilian head, attached themselves to the girl’s body and sank their fangs into her.

<b>

They bit into her arms, crushing the bones with their fangs.

They tore into the flesh of her thighs, gnawing at the exposed femur.

They sank their fangs into her abdomen, ripping it open and devouring the entrails within.

They bit through her throat, severing her head, crushing the skull, and slurping up the brain inside.

<b>

The girl, barely alive, was thus devoured by the beasts while still alive, used to satisfy their brutal desires.

<b>

“No matter how bad it tastes, one must not waste ingredients.”

<b>

The boy sat down in a chair, resting his elbows on the table.

He was still savoring the gem from earlier in his mouth like candy.

<b>

<b>

“Lord Orubetto, you have a visitor.”

<b>

From the shadow behind the chair where the boy sat, a young man appeared.

He seemed to be around 17 or 18 years old.

He was significantly older than the boy called Orubetto.

<b>

Dressed entirely in colorless black butler attire, his silver hair, slicked back, appeared violet in the light.

He lowered his long, narrow eyes, the same blue as the boy’s, as he announced the visitor.

<b>

<b>

From the shadow behind the silver butler, a woman also appeared silently, just like him.

<b>

Her appearance suggested she had reached adulthood, and she was coldly beautiful.

With porcelain skin and thick, blood-red lips.

Her sky-blue eyes displayed a thoughtful calmness.

Her platinum blonde hair, parted neatly in the center, flowed down to her chest, becoming more radiant as it extended.

The dress, which exposed her shoulders and had a deep neckline, generously showcased her ample bosom.

<b>

The dress enveloping her body was a deep garnet, redder than blood.

The hem and ribbons of the dress were adorned with black, accentuating the overall outfit.

The waistline of the skirt tapered downward to create a slimmer appearance, and the tiered skirt flared out, hiding her feet and making her slender waist appear even thinner.

<b>

“I apologize for interrupting your meal. Please forgive my rudeness for this uninvited visit.”

<b>

The woman quietly bowed her head, apologizing for the sudden visit.

<b>

“Absolutely. It’s completely uncouth. Well, it’s fine since I’m done anyway.”

<b>

Orubetto crushed what he had been toying with in his mouth.

<b>

“I am grateful for your generosity, Lord Orubetto.”

<b>

Without looking at Orubetto, the woman quietly bowed her head.

<b>

“Tch! So? What do you want all of a sudden? You, the errand girl Clarimond!”

“Yes, I have a message from Lord Rodulf.”

“I know that! You’re here! There’s nothing else, right?! This is why I dislike lustful women! I’m asking what you want from me!”

“Yes, I apologize. Lord Rodulf wishes for the delay of the Iroshio expedition by the knight order in the royal capital.”

<b>

Without changing her expression at Orubetto’s insult, the woman called Clarimond calmly conveyed her message.

<b>

“Isn’t dealing with those muscle-bound fools the job of their own brainless types?!”

“Halbart is currently executing a plan in the Great Forest…”

“Tch! Then they should just face them head-on, right?!”

“If we do that, it will cause delays in the plan. Therefore, we would like to ask for your assistance, Lord Orubetto.”

“Tch! You’re a hard taskmaster! So? What do you want me to do?!”

“Yes, the expedition team requires a guide to enter the Great Forest. We will arrange personnel and prepare in the village most familiar with the Great Forest.”

“Oh… So, is that village the one I’m thinking of?”

<b>

Orubetto, who had been leaning on the table with a frown, narrowed his eyes with interest.

<b>

<b>

“Yes, it is that village. We ask that you leave the village in a state where the expedition team cannot prepare.”

“Does that mean I can annihilate the village if I want?”

“They have entrusted it to you, Lord Orubetto.”

<b>

“Oh… that sounds good. I’ve been to that village before, and there were many lively kids there. Among them was a particularly exceptional star jewel collector… Although Rodulf used them last time! Well, if this is meant to make up for that… Hmm! You’re showing some consideration, aren’t you?”

“I appreciate it.”

<b>

“Fine! I’ll go!”

“Thank you. My lord will also be pleased.”

<b>

Orubetto spread his arms and cheerfully announced, and Clarimond quietly responded.

<b>

“What?! Does the king know about this?! I had no choice but to comply from the start! …Well, it’s fine!”

“I apologize. May I ask about your schedule?”

“Well, I just went to Iroshio not long ago. I sympathize with Halbart, who has to turn back… No, that necrophiliac probably doesn’t care! But I just settled here! Is it not a problem if I visit in the autumn?”

<b>

“No problem at all. I will convey that to Lord Rodulf.”

“Ah, thank you. By the way, it must be tough serving humans, huh? Oh, in your case, you enjoy it, right? Haha! Well, do your best!”

“I appreciate your concern. I pray that your duties will be fulfilled safely. I will take my leave now.”

<b>

Clarimond mechanically offered her farewell, bowed deeply, and then vanished into the shadows.

<b>

<b>

“Hmph! A lustful female rat shaking her tail at humans!”

<b>

He glared at the shadow where Clarimond had disappeared with disdain.

<b>

“Eihabu! I’m going out! The mansion is suffocating with the vulgar scent of lustful females! Clean it up!”

“Understood! Lord Orubetto, what shall we do with the others?”

“A hunting trip for a change! No one… No, I’ll take Doug and Eliza with me. Watching their hunt will be entertaining too.”

“Yes, I will prepare immediately.”

“Hmph! I don’t like it, but… the village of Tribune, huh? That’s one thing to look forward to.”

<b>

Orubetto twisted his mouth into an ugly grin and dissolved into the shadows as if melting into the water.
