# 25 The Pleasures of Orbet Mash

There are some cruel descriptions. Please be careful if you do not like it.


----------------

<blank>

Sole shook her colorless white hair in a flurry.

Their chilling cerulean blue eyes look down on and ridicule everyone but themselves.

The corners of his mouth turn up, distorting his thin, bloodless mouth.

<blank>

Looks about 10 years old.

Black outerwear and white shirt.

On his chest, he wore a jabot with many folds like those worn by the nobility, and at the center of the jabot was a jewel of the same color as his eyes.

Furthermore, colorful jewels adorned around the neck peeked out from the gaps in the outer garments.

<blank>

Sole, who still looks like an innocent boy, is now holding up a girl.

The girl is 12 or 3 years old, somewhat larger than the boy, but he is not bothered by this and lifts her up with only his left hand on her waist.

<blank>

The girl, held by the waist and bent over, stares into the void with eyes wide open and tears welling up in her eyes.

His lips quivered with blood, and he repeated small words of forgiveness.

<blank>

A white-haired boy looks down happily at the girl.

When the boy muttered something in her ear, the girl's eyes widened even more and she tried to scream, but her voice was inaudible.

Even if you try to escape, you can't move even slightly, as if you are locked in place by an invisible commandment.

<blank>

The girl's eyes were turning the color of despair, and her mouth opened and closed repeatedly in vain.

The boy takes the girl's left hand in front of him, brings it close to his own mouth, and kisses it tenderly.

<blank>

Then he goes on to slowly tighten his grip on the girl's hand.

My bones creaked with a mishri.

The girl's eyes widen even more and her mouth moves to stop, but no words come out.

<blank>

Soon, a dull sound, as if several twigs were being crushed, echoes through the room.

The girl bursts into tears and tries to scream from the back of her throat, but all that escapes is the sound of air.

No sad voices leaked out.

<blank>

The boy watches the girl's expression with a happy tilt of his head, and his mouth twists even more.

<blank>

Air is squeezed out of the girl's mouth as she screams intermittently.

<blank>

The boy grasped the girl's hand and with a yukkuri, twisted her arm in the opposite direction of her elbow joint.

The girl's arm bent in a direction it would not normally face.

<blank>

<blank>

The girl opens her throat further and screams, but all that comes out is air with more force than before.

The inability to speak made the girl's pain seem even greater.

Tears flowed unceasingly from her wide-open eyes, and her pupils trembled slightly.

<blank>

The boy's smile deepens with joy as he senses that the girl is losing her sanity.

He threw out the girl's arm and grabbed her forehead with his right hand.

<blank>

<blank>

The boy's fingernails are as sharp as those of a predator.

The boy dug his claws into the girl's temples and dragged her head down, exposing her throat.

The girl's eyes flicker with even more fear.

<blank>

The boy takes a yukuri at the girl's throat as it is.

It's like biting into the finest fruit....

The girl's body stiffens and twitches with pain and fear like never before.

<blank>

The boy's eyes changed from cold blue to blood red, glowing and shimmering suspiciously.

<blank>

As the girl's body becomes bloodless and white as wax.

Eventually, the animation disappears from his eyes, and his body loses its power, and he loses his semblance of being a living person.

<blank>

The boy removes his mouth from the girl's throat and throws her body down as if he were throwing a drink can.

The boy mopped his mouth and pulled a jewel the size of the tip of his pinky finger out of his mouth onto his tongue, which looked like a blood clot.

<blank>

"Hmm, the colors aren't good, and there's a lot of fog."

<blank>

Put it back in your mouth again and let it play in your mouth as if you were licking a candy ball.

<blank>



<blank>

Something began to stir in the shadowy part of the room.

<blank>

Oh, that's enough. Even if you leave it to die soon, it will die soon. Just get rid of it."

<blank>

<blank>

As if waiting for her words, something leaps out of the shadows and bites the girl's body.

<blank>

It had five human-like bodies, but the tip of its nose was protruding, its mouth was wide open, and its vicious fangs were in disorder.

A few of these crocodile-like creatures, neither human nor beast, attached themselves to the girl's body and bared their fangs.

<blank>

It bites into the arm and crushes and bites off the bone with its fangs.

He devoured the flesh of his thighs and munched on the exposed femur.

It set its fangs on its abdomen and tore into it, dragging out the organs in its belly and devouring them.

They bite off the throat, drop the head, crush the cranium and sip and eat the brain inside.

<blank>

The girl, dying but barely alive, was thus devoured alive by the beasts and used up to satisfy their brutal desires.

<blank>

No matter how bad the food tastes, it mustn't go to waste!"

<blank>

The boy slumped in his chair and put his elbows on the table.

In my mouth, I am still licking around the gem I just found like candy.

<blank>

<blank>

"Mr. Orbet, you have a visitor."

<blank>

Behind the chair in which the boy was sitting, a younger man suddenly appeared out of the shadows.

The age range is 17-8 years old.

He is much older than the boy called Orbet.

<blank>

Her entire body is wrapped in a colorless black butler's uniform, and her fine silver hair, brushed back in an all-back style, appears wisteria-colored in some lights.

He announced his visitor with his slitted, downcast eyes, the same blue as the boy's.

<blank>

<blank>

From the shadows behind the silver butler, a woman appeared, also like him, without a sound.

<blank>

His appearance, which would have been that of an adult, is chillingly beautiful.

White porcelain skin and thick, blood-red lips.

His sky-blue tinted eyes showed thoughtful composure.

Her platinum blonde hair, neatly parted in the middle and flowing down her chest on either side, becomes more luminous the further she goes.

The dress, with its shoulders exposed and chest wide open, overflowed with rich twin dunes that looked as if they were about to spill out without reserve.

<blank>

The dress that envelops her is a deep garnet that is even redder than blood.

The hem of the dress and the ribbon are decorated with black to tighten the entire outfit.

The skirt's seam at the waist was pointed downward to make her look slimmer, and the tiered skirt, which spread out in layers from there, concealed her legs and made her slender waist look thinner.

<blank>

Please excuse me for interrupting your meal. Forgive me for my impolite visit."

<blank>

The woman quietly bows her head and mouths an apology for the unexpected visit.

<blank>

It's totally tactless. It's totally tactless. Well, it's over now.

<blank>

Orbet bites down on what he had been toying with in his mouth.

<blank>

I cannot thank you enough for your generosity, Mr. Orbet. I cannot thank you enough for your generosity, Mr. Orbet.

<blank>

Without looking Orbet in the eye, the woman quietly bowed her head.

<blank>

Tsk! So? What do you want all of a sudden? I'm your errand boy, Clarimonde the rat!

Yes, Mr. Rodolphe has a message for you.

I know that! You're here! What else is there to say? That's why I don't like women in heat! I'm asking you what you want!

Yes, I beg your pardon. Sir Rodolphe wishes to delay the expedition of the Knights of King's Landing to Irosio."

<blank>

The woman called Clarimonde, who did not change her color at Orbet's insult, nonchalantly conveys her business.

<blank>

Isn't it the job of the brains over there to deal with those muscle dummies?

Mr. Hulbert is currently in the Great Forest carrying out his plans..."

"Damn it! Then why don't you just go ahead and intercept them?

That would have caused delays in our plans. That is why I am here to ask for your help.

Damn! You're a rough person! So? What do you want from me?

Yes, the expedition needs a guide to enter the Great Forest. We will coordinate and prepare the personnel in the villages that are most familiar with the Great Forest.

Heh,...... is that supposed to be that village?"

<blank>

Orbet's eyes, which until then had been resting on the table with his elbows on the table and his brow furrowed in a grimace, narrowed in interest.

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, in the village. I would like you to make sure that the village is not ready for the expedition.

Does that mean you don't mind if I destroy your village?"

He said he would leave the matter to Mr. Orbet."

<blank>

I've been to that village before. I've been to that village before, and there were many healthy kids there. Among them, there was a girl who got the best star beads...but Rodolphe used her the other day! Well, if you say you're trying to make up for that ...... That's a little more tactful."

Thank you.

<blank>

Okay, I'll go with you! I'll go with you.

Thank you. Mylord will be pleased."

<blank>

Orbet extends his hand and happily announces, and Clarimonde quietly replies.

<blank>

What? Does the king know about this? I didn't have veto power from the beginning! Well, that's all right!

I'm sorry. So, may I ask what your schedule is?"

I was just in Irosio a couple of days ago. Well, I feel sorry for Halbert who had to take it back. ...... No, he doesn't care about that necrophilia! But I'm just getting settled in here. Shouldn't I visit you in the fall?"

<blank>

No problem at all. I will inform Mr. Rodolphe accordingly.

"Oh, I'm looking forward to working with you. But then again, it's hard for you to work for a human, isn't it? Oh, in your case, you serve them because you like it, right? Ha ha! Well, good luck!

Thank you for your concern. Thank you very much for your concern. I hope you will be able to carry out your duties safely. Now, if you will excuse me.

<blank>

Clarimonde mechanically greeted his exit, bowed his head once more deeply, and disappeared directly into the shadows.

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmph! A rat in heat, shaking her ass at a human!"

<blank>

He stares at Clarimonde's vanished shadow with abhorrence.

<blank>

Ahab! I'm going out! The inside of the mansion is suffocating with the smell of vile rutting bitches! Keep it clean!"

"Ha, ha! Master Orbet, what shall we do with my companions?"

I'm hunting for a change of pace! Whoever ...... is going, let's take Doug and Eliza with us. It'll be fun to watch them hunt."

Yes, sir. We'll have everything ready for you right away.

I don't like it! I don't like it. ...... Tribune Village, now that's something to look forward to."

<blank>

Orbette's mouth twisted into an ugly smile and she swayed as she dissolved into the water and disappeared into the shadows.
