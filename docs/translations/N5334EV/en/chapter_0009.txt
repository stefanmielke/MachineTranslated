"How was it?　You were pretty okay, weren't you?"

I mean, I'm fine, but ......, that hurt, didn't it?"

But you took it in stride.

"I'd say I'm fine, or ...... painful, but not unbearable ......, at least?"

He hit me pretty hard, didn't he?　He put more force than a normal amateur would have been able to withstand."

"Oh, yeah?　Well, it hurt, didn't it?　I was pretty okay with it, but..."

That's what I call the "kata" effect.

"The one you just did, right? Was it 'santin'?"

Well, I'm not quite ready to master it completely, so it's just a confusing thing.

"I see... I see... I see..."

As I taught you earlier, if you close your fist from the little finger when you extend your hand, and if you are aware of Ki at this point on your arm, you can achieve that level of effect.

You know, the side of the arm from the elbow to the base of the little finger here?　It sure feels warmer here when I'm conscious of it."

In kata, it is a matter of course to perform the movements correctly, but it is also important to have the correct awareness of what you are doing so that the true power of the kata can come out.

What's that hard to say?"

When you bow with three fingers and raise your body, you can lift your body up with a stick from the middle of your chest, where the color imager is located. If you raise your body with the mindset of "I'm going to bow with my three fingers," you can raise your body without much effort. Even if you are being held down from above, if the weight is a little heavy, you will not feel much resistance and will be able to get up easily.

In fact, the theory that Yamato Nadeshiko is the strongest!"

Japanese manners and gestures are actually a form of efficient flow of ch'i. When you move chopsticks correctly, ch'i flows through them. If you move the chopsticks correctly, Ki (energy) will flow properly. Why don't you take this opportunity to learn proper etiquette?

But, you know, that 'sunchin' you just did?　If I could, I'd like to learn a technique that would make me stronger like that! That's what it is, right? If I can do it right, I won't even feel pain, right?"

No, I think pain is normal."

What?　Really?"

You say, "Look, pain is an important piece of information. Pain is an important piece of information. If you don't have pain, you don't know what kind of condition your body is in. If you don't have pain, you don't know how far you can go. We need to understand pain, not reject it.

<blank>

Yesterday we ended up back at the waterfall where we first camped.

I found the trail ...... when I headed north on the road ...... in the woods, and I figured if I wanted to find a place to encamp, it would be quicker to follow it.

<blank>

The reason for this was that he wanted to do the verification in a shallow area of the forest.

<blank>

"If you want to verify the damage, it would be better to try it first with lower defensive equipment or without armor!　With higher level equipment, you'll be sure to play it off when you get attacked by these mobs ......"

<blank>

If I am attacked in that state, I don't want to be attacked by wolf fangs or bear claws.

At least at first, it is an initial request for a more gentle partner .......

<blank>

I have been popped, chopped, and minced so many times that I am not sure what I am saying now. I've been popped, chopped up, and minced, so what am I saying now?

<blank>

<blank>

That is why I am now using the waterfall to bathe like a shower.

The reason why is because after all the things I've done.

<blank>

"If it's not cold enough to take an early morning dip like this, does that mean it's July or August now?"

<blank>

She is struck by the waterfall water and somehow mouthing it while shaking her shapely breasts.

Then, a rather lovely sound echoed around the area: k~~~~.......

<blank>

"...... hungry......"

<blank>

He muttered sadly as he put his hand on his stomach area.

So far, he had not taken a meal until his hunger had reached its limit.

Reason: .......

<blank>

'Another tasteless meal~! I'm ...... hungry, but I can't believe how depressing this meal is. ......"

<blank>

Literally, the food they have has almost no taste.

<blank>

Basha and naked, he left the waterfall and went up to the water's edge.

He took a towel out of his inventory, wrapped it around his body, opened his gut legs, and sat down on the nearest rock.

It is not an outfit that a daughter of a very young age can expose in public.

Well, the inside is different from your daughter!

<blank>

Once again, I take the stew out of my inventory, this time to sip.

It is always freshly made and hot.

But see .......

<blank>

...... not tasty~!"

<blank>

At any rate, I scraped it all down in one go, as if anything would do as long as I could get it into my stomach.

<blank>

"Hifuhohohohohohohohohohohoho ......"

<blank>

It's not something you talk about while putting it in your mouth.

<blank>

Susie forcefully swallows it all down in one gulp.

<blank>

I'm not sure what to do!　...... I still need to think about going out to the human village at Nalu early. I really think people need a tasty meal!

<blank>

When he finished his forced meal, he yodeled and stood up.

He took off his towel and put it in his inventory, and the next moment he was wrapped in D equipment.

<blank>

I thought to myself, "Wait a minute. Now that we can hunt without detonating the bomb, can we hunt food normally?　Can't we just go and hunt birds and stuff?"

<blank>

He looks up as if a thought has just occurred to him.

<blank>

I'm sure you can make it!　We can go, right?　Okay, let's go!　Let's pick up some food while we're at it!　Unh!　Let's do that!

<blank>

I chuckled to myself as I looked happily to the south.

<blank>

"Well, we'll just have to go south 5 to 60 kilometers, won't we?　I'm sure there will be a few cute ones as we get closer to human habitation!"

<blank>

After saying this, he quickly took off southward.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

As it turns out, ...... was scattered.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

There was a big boar-like mob.

He was like Nantokanushi.

<blank>

I thought, "I can eat this! I thought.

<blank>

For a start, I shot the initial flame magic.

Burned. Turned to charcoal.

All I could taste was charcoal.

<blank>

Next, he sliced the guy into rounds and then cut out the appropriate parts.

I didn't know what was where, so I muddled through and found the red meat, cut it out and grilled it.

<blank>

It smelled soooo beastly and rotten meat.

I thought maybe I needed some herbs or at least a smell masker.

I forced myself to take a sip and tears started to well up in my mouth on their own.

The strong taste I was looking for was Koretogau.

I cried egregiously.

<blank>

Maybe the Mob, i.e., monsters, are not suitable for foodstuffs? I thought so and tried to take birds as usual.

<blank>

There was a big eagle-like creature, so I picked up a pebble, covered it with Ki, and shot it out with my fingertip, a finger bullet.

It was an easy shot down.

<blank>

Okay, let's cook! I thought.

I don't know how to handle it.

At this time, I clearly realized that I had zero survival skills.

<blank>

I had no choice but to cook it over a fire as it was.

The feathers stuck to the skin and were very hard to eat, so I scraped off the skin and ate it.

It was kind of hard, stringy, and had a liver-like smell in my nose.

<blank>

was forced to eat.

I don't mind liver, but please don't give me this one.

<blank>

I still cried.

I want salt at least. I want pepper. I want soy sauce!

I can't cook wild food that makes the most of the flavors of the ingredients!

<blank>

I want to eat ramen. I want to eat ramen. I want a big bowl of Senke's green onion chashu pork!

Sick Sick Sick Sick .......

<blank>

<blank>

I am very frustrated that I can't handle or cook.

<blank>

At least a strategy site!　Please, Dream Cheat!　Easy demolition video prezooo!!!!"

<blank>

It was impossible.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'll get back on track and verify the damage to my main objective today!"

<blank>

I fell down on all fours, but forced myself to stand up, clenching my fists.

It was not a very humane meal, but it did fill me up.

My stomach is full and for some reason I am very sad.

So I decided to fulfill my original purpose today.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'N~~~......, how about that thing?　Forest Basilisk. Basilisk is just a big lizard that petrifies you and it wasn't a big deal, right?　I mean, it's big, but it doesn't look like it's more than 2 meters long. ...... There was a big lizard up there, but it was over 10 meters long. I think it was "Ice Lizard" and "White Basilisk". It's the size of a baby, so it should be fine.

<blank>

A two-meter lizard is a big deal, but the standard seems to be out of whack.

<blank>

<blank>

Its appearance is closer to that of a dinosaur than to that of a lizard.

Strong hind legs, small forelegs forward, but with powerful claws.

The neck supports a long, small head.

It looks like a small Raptor.

<blank>

Its entire body is covered with blue-green scales, and its head is covered with a pair of fins that resemble scallops.

The fins break off at the neck and spread wide again on the back.

Those golden eyes found Suzy and came straight at her.

<blank>

Suzy stows away her weapons and waits with only heavy equipment.

<blank>

He raised his head high as he ran about five meters away, his eyes glowing with a single bright flash, but nothing happened.

Basilisk showed a quizzical look for a moment, but then immediately increased its speed and came barreling in.

<blank>

Suzy easily resisted Basilisk's petrifying glare.

Many opponents resist petrification.

If we are afraid at every turn, we will be beaten.

<blank>

If petrification doesn't work, then stick them with fangs and claws that have a paralyzing poison.

The muscles of the hind legs are dilated and unleashed.

He closed the distance at once, aimed at the neck, and pounced.

<blank>

But the mouth is empty.

Then, it tries to pull the animal to the point of avoidance by hooking its sharp claws like sickles on its front legs.

But that, too, was avoided by a paper-thin margin.

<blank>

If this is the case, he tries to crush them with his weight by directly hitting them with his body, but they are no longer there.

He swishes his long tail without a peep.

I can regain my balance with this, but if I hit this guy who ran away, it will not be a free lunch.

<blank>

But its tail also cut through the air.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

(Huh?　I was wondering why I was getting hit so hard, but I thought I was subconsciously avoiding it.)

<blank>

It is like a willow swaying in the wind.

Suzy found herself avoiding the momentum of her opponent's attack without being particularly aware of it, as her body sensed it on its own.

<blank>

(This is level compensation, right?　(This is a level compensation!) It means there's a big difference in level between me and this guy, right?　(I might not be able to get hit unless I'm conscious of the attack. ......)

<blank>

After being repeatedly evaded, Basilisk, fed up with the situation, began to gather his strength and stooped low to unleash a powerful headbutt.

<blank>

Oh?　You coming?　All right!　Jump into the lady's chest!　Come on, come on, come on!

<blank>

Basilisk kicked the ground and rushed forward.

Susie opened her arms and assumed a welcoming position.

The moment the heads collide, he thrusts out his chest and catches it!　And the basilisk's head shattered and popped.

<blank>

'Whoopppp!　Pah-pah-pah!"

<blank>

I got a big brain plasma or something from my face.

<blank>

'Uh-oh!　Pepe!　Pepe!　Ugh~Pepe!　What the heck~?"

<blank>

Remove the jar of water from the inventory and rinse it off by covering your head with water.

<blank>

Ugh," he said!　Damn it, ......!　Oh ......, phew!　......, no way!　Pek!　...... Atashi's chest was a weapon!　You were the murder weapon!　Pee!"

<blank>

That's not what I meant!

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's that one or !　That or ...... Pek!　Because it was clothed in "Ki", pe!　It was filled with fighting spirit, pe!　I hit him with my fist, pe!　It's the same thing?　Pepe!"

<blank>

Rinse the mouth again and again with water.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm still smelling gross in my mouth... ...... I want to take a quick dip today ......!

<blank>

After several water bottle showers, I suddenly heard a small explosion and grabbed something that flew by at high speed.

<blank>

"Is this the guy you've been flying around earlier: ....... A 'bread beetle'?　Looks like a canary with a head full of spines. Wow!　This guy is so scary.

<blank>

With a flick of his fingertips, he sent the Beetle he was holding flying like a finger-bomb.

The second one that flew in next hit it and crushed it.

<blank>

<blank>

With a quick tilt of his head to the right, he ducked the third fish.

The third one, which was dodged, penetrated a tree that looked to be more than a hug behind Suzy and dug into a rock at the base of the tree.

<blank>

Wow, it really is like a bullet. There's some kind of wallah-wallah gathering at ....... Are they getting into our territory or something?"

<blank>

There's triple digits, right? ......, he muttered, looking disgusted.

He is wary of his surroundings as he stomps and crushes the Beetle, which has been reduced to the ground.

<blank>

Come on!

The fourth one is struck with the right square fist.

<blank>

Toriya!"

The fifth one was turned down with a left-handed sword.

<blank>

"Hoa!"

The sixth one is paid with the right back fist and crushed.

<blank>

TOOTSUO!!!"

The seventh fish is crushed by a left hook thrust.

<blank>

Woot woot!"

8th and 9th fish on the right and left.

<blank>

Tattoo."　Tee!　Hoa!　Hota!"

The Beetles come flying in one after another, emitting an explosive sound, and are struck down one after another with both fists.

<blank>

Oh, my God!"

<blank>

'Duh!　Where in the world is this lore!　Oh, my God, what a pain in the ass!

<blank>

Instantly, he equipped his sword and released sword chi forward.

<blank>

Shatter, shatter, shatter!

<blank>

≪Impact Storm≫.

The crowd of Beetles in front of us were blown away in one fell swoop.

In addition, the surrounding trees are quite extensive.

<blank>

"...... Ah."

<blank>

The crumbling tree breaks and falls down.

A little bit of déjà vu.

<blank>

I'm so lucky. ....... Tehepe-roo!"

<blank>

It's not a teppeppe-roku!
