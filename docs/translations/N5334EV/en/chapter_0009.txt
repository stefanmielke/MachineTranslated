# Episode 09: Suzy Searches for Food

"How was it? You were pretty okay, right?"

"Well, I mean, I was okay, but... it hurt, you know?"

"But you were taking it like a champ, weren't you?"

"It's not that I was okay... it hurt, but it wasn't unbearable, you know?"

"You were hit pretty hard just now, right? The kind of force that a normal amateur wouldn't be able to withstand."

"Is that so? Well, it did hurt, but I was definitely okay."

"That's the effect of 'kata', you see."

"That thing we did earlier, right? 'Sanchin', wasn't it?"

"Well, since you haven't fully mastered it yet, it's just a makeshift version."

"I see, that makes sense."

"As I mentioned earlier, when you spread your hands, if you close your fists starting from the pinky and focus your 'ki' in this part of your arm, you can achieve that level of effect."

"You're talking about the side of the arm from the elbow to the base of the pinky, right? I definitely felt warmth there when I focused."

"'Kata' is about performing the movements correctly, but on top of that, having the right awareness allows you to unleash your true power."

"You're starting to sound pretty complicated there."

"To put it simply, when you bow with three fingers down and rise, if you imagine lifting your body from the center of your chest, around where the collarbone is, using a stick or something, you can lift your body without much effort. Even if someone is pressing down from above, you can still rise without feeling much resistance."

"Is there a theory that the Yamato Nadeshiko is the strongest?"

"Actually, the manners and movements in Japanese culture are forms that allow 'ki' to flow efficiently. Even using chopsticks correctly allows 'ki' to flow properly. Why not take this opportunity to learn proper manners?"

"But, you know, that 'Sanchin' thing? I want to learn techniques that can make me strong like that! Once you can do it properly, you won't feel pain anymore, right?"

"No, I think pain will still be there."

"Huh? Is that so?"

"Listen. Pain is important information. If you don't feel pain, you won't know the state of your body. In such a state, you won't be able to tell how far you can push yourself, right? Pain isn't something to reject; it's something to understand."

<b>

<b>

In the end, I returned to the place by the waterfall where we first camped yesterday.

I found a path in the forest... it's the trail from when I headed north... so I thought it would be quicker to follow that if I was looking for a camping spot.

<b>

There was also a reason I wanted to do the testing in a shallow part of the forest.

<b>

"If I'm going to test damage, it's better to try it with low-defense gear or without armor at all! With higher-level gear, I would definitely block the attacks from the mobs around here..."

<b>

If I'm going to take hits in that state, I really don't want to face a wolf's fangs or a bear's claws right away.

At least at first, I'd prefer a gentler opponent... that's my naive wish.

<b>

I've already blown away, sliced, and minced so many creatures before, so what am I saying now? But there's no one here to point that out.

<b>

<b>

So, with that in mind, I'm currently using the waterfall to take a shower.

The reason for that is because I've just done something like that.

<b>

"Is it because it's early morning and I'm not cold taking a shower like this that it's July or August right now?"

<b>

As I let the waterfall hit me, my well-shaped breasts swaying, I muttered to myself.

Then, a cute sound echoed around me.

<b>

"...I'm hungry..."

<b>

I placed my hand on my stomach and murmured sadly.

So far, I had refrained from eating until my hunger reached its limit.

The reason is...

<b>

"Another tasteless meal... Even though I'm hungry, feeling this gloomy about food is just..."

<b>

Literally, the food I have on hand has almost no flavor.

<b>

I splashed out of the waterfall, still naked, and climbed up to the water's edge.

I pulled a towel from my inventory, wrapped it around my body, spread my legs wide, and sat down on a nearby rock.

It's not a position that a girl of my age should be showing in public.

Well, the insides are different from a regular girl, though!

<b>

I took out some stew from my inventory and slurped it down.

It's always piping hot and freshly made.

However...

<b>

"...It's not delicious~~~"

<b>

I gulped it down as if anything would do as long as it went into my stomach.

<b>

"Hyohuhouhihihouhuhahihihah..."

<b>

This is not how you should talk while eating.

<b>

Suzy forcefully swallowed it all at once.

<b>

"Kuhaaーーー! ...I really need to think about getting back to town soon. I seriously feel that people need meals with flavor!!"

<b>

After forcing down my meal, I stood up with a grunt.

I took off the towel and put it back in my inventory, and in the next moment, I was clad in D gear.

<b>

"Oh, wait. Since I can hunt without blowing things up now, can I hunt for food normally? I should be able to go for birds, right?"

<b>

I suddenly had a thought and looked up.

<b>

"That's right! I can do it! Alright! While I'm testing damage, I'll also gather food! Yes! Let's do that!!"

<b>

I muttered to myself happily while looking south.

<b>

"For now, I should head south for about 50 to 60 kilometers? As I get closer to human settlements, some cute creatures should start appearing!"

<b>

With that said, I quickly headed south.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

To put it bluntly... it was a disaster.

<b>

<b>

<b>

There was a huge mob that looked like a wild boar.

It was something like a 'Nan toka Nushi'.

<b>

I thought, "This is edible!"

<b>

So, I shot my initial fire-type magic.

It burned. It turned to charcoal.

It only tasted like charcoal.

<b>

Next, I sliced it into rounds and cut off some random parts.

I had no idea what was where, and while it was a mess, I picked out some red meat and grilled it.

<b>

It smelled incredibly gamey and like rotten meat.

I thought maybe I needed some herbs or something to mask the smell.

When I forced a bite into my mouth, tears started to flow uncontrollably.

This is not the rich flavor I was looking for.

I cried out in disgust.

<b>

Maybe mobs, or monsters, aren't suitable for food? I thought, so I tried to catch a regular bird.

<b>

I saw a big eagle, so I picked up a small stone, wrapped it in 'ki', and shot it with my fingertip, like a finger flick.

I easily shot it down.

<b>

Alright, time to cook! I thought.

But I had no idea how to process it.

At that moment, I clearly realized that I had zero survival skills.

<b>

With no other choice, I just threw it on the fire and tried to grill it.

The feathers stuck to the skin, making it really hard to eat, so I peeled the skin off and tried eating it.

It was tough, stringy, and had a liver-like smell that hit my nose.

<b>

But I forced myself to eat it.

I don't hate liver, but I wish I could skip this one.

<b>

I ended up crying again.

I at least wanted salt. I wanted pepper. I wanted soy sauce!

Wild cooking that brings out the flavor of the ingredients is impossible for me!!

<b>

"I want ramen. I want home-style ramen. I want a large serving of negi chashu from Senya!!"

Sniffle sniffle...

<b>

<b>

I feel so frustrated that I can't process or cook anything.

<b>

"I just want a攻略サイト! Please, dream cheat! Easy dismantling videos, please!!!"

<b>

It was impossible.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Alright, let's get back to today's main damage testing!"

<b>

I got down on all fours, feeling down, but I forced myself to clench my fists and stand up.

It was hard to call it a human-like meal, but my stomach was full.

Even though my stomach was full, I felt strangely sad.

So, I decided to fulfill my original purpose today.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ummm... how about that? 'Forest Basilisk'. The basilisk is just a big lizard that can petrify, and it wasn't a big deal, right? Even if it's big, it doesn't seem to be more than 2 meters... There were bigger lizards above, but they were over 10 meters. I think they were 'Ice Lizards' and 'White Basilisks'. This one seems to be about the size of a baby."

<b>

Even saying it's a 2-meter lizard is already a big deal, but it seems my standards are a bit skewed.

<b>

<b>

Its appearance is closer to a dinosaur than a lizard.

It has strong hind legs, and its front legs are small but have powerful claws.

Its neck is long, supporting a small head.

It resembles a small raptor.

<b>

Its entire body is covered in blue-green scales, and it has a crest-like fin on its head.

The fin that stops at the neck spreads out again on its back.

Its golden eyes spotted Suzy and headed straight toward her.

<b>

Suzy stored her weapon and waited in heavy armor.

<b>

At a distance of about 5 meters, it ran with its neck raised high, its eyes shining brightly, but nothing happened.

The basilisk showed a moment of suspicion but quickly increased its speed and charged.

<b>

Suzy easily resisted the basilisk's petrifying gaze.

There are not many who can resist petrification.

If I flinch every time, I'll be the one in trouble.

<b>

If petrification doesn't work, then I can just stab it with my fangs and claws that have paralysis poison.

I expanded the muscles in my hind legs and released them.

I closed the distance in an instant and leaped toward its neck.

<b>

But my mouth cut through empty air.

In that case, I tried to hook its front legs with my scythe-like sharp claws and pull it closer.

However, that too was narrowly avoided.

<b>

Then I tried to slam my body into it and crush it with my weight, but the opponent was no longer there.

I immediately swung my long tail.

I could regain my balance with that, but if it hit the one that escaped, it wouldn't end well.

<b>

But that tail also cut through the air.

<b>

<b>

<b>

(Huh? I was thinking, 'Why can't I hit anything?' and realized that I'm unconsciously dodging it myself?)

<b>

Like a willow swaying in the wind.

Suzy noticed that her body was sensing the opponent's attack and dodging it without her conscious awareness.

<b>

(Is this what they call level adjustment? It means there's quite a level difference between us, huh? If I don't consciously take the hits, I might not get hit at all...)

<b>

As the basilisk repeatedly missed its attacks, it became frustrated and lowered its body to prepare for a powerful headbutt, gathering its strength.

<b>

"Oh? Is it coming? Alright! Come on and dive into the lady's chest! Bring it on!!"

<b>

The basilisk kicked off the ground and charged.

Suzy opened her arms, ready to embrace it.

At the moment their heads collided, she thrust her chest forward to catch it! The basilisk's head shattered and burst apart.

<b>

"Uwa!? Parapapap!!"

<b>

She was splattered with brain matter and other things all over her face.

<b>

"Ugh! Peh peh! Puh! Ughhh, peh! Wh-why~~~?"

<b>

She took out a water-filled jar from her inventory and poured water over her head to wash it off.

<b>

"Ugh, peh! It stinks...! Ah... peh! ...No way! Peh! ...My chest was a weapon!?"

<b>

No, that's not it!

<b>

"Peh! Is it... peh! Because I was wrapped in 'ki', peh! It turned into the same thing as hitting with a fist filled with fighting spirit? Peh!"

<b>

She rinsed her mouth with water repeatedly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ugh, my mouth still feels gross and smells bad... I just want to take a shower quickly...!!!"

<b>

After taking several showers with the water jar, she suddenly heard a small explosion and grabbed something that flew at high speed.

<b>

"So that's what was flying around me earlier... 'Bread Beetle'? It looks like a cantharid with spikes all over its head. Whoa! This thing is tough."

<b>

She flicked it with her fingertip and sent the beetle flying like a projectile.

She hit the second one that flew at her next and smashed it.

<b>

<b>

She tilted her head to the right to dodge the third one.

The third beetle, which was dodged, pierced through a tree that was more than a hug in size behind Suzy and embedded itself into the rock at its base.

<b>

"Wow, it really is like a bullet. A bunch of them are gathering... Did I intrude on their territory?"

<b>

There must be at least three digits... she muttered with a sigh.

As she crushed the beetle embedded in the ground, she remained vigilant of her surroundings.

<b>

"Take that!"

She punched the fourth one with her right fist.

<b>

"Here I go!"

She sliced the fifth one with her left hand.

<b>

"Hoah!"

She smashed the sixth one with a backfist.

<b>

"Tsuo!"

She crushed the seventh one with a left hook.

<b>

"Whoa, whoa!"

She took down the eighth and ninth with her right and left fists.

<b>

"Ta! Ti! Hoah! Hoah!"

With explosive sounds, she knocked down the beetles that came flying one after another with her fists.

<b>

"Owww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww oww!"

<b>

"Ahhhhh!! Who the hell is this successor?! This is so annoying!!"

<b>

In an instant, she equipped her sword and unleashed sword energy forward.

<b>

"Shatter into pieces!!"

<b>

≪Impact Storm≫

She blew away the swarm of beetles in front of her all at once.

In the process, she also took down quite a few trees around her.

<b>

"...Ah."

<b>

The trees that were about to collapse creaked and fell.

Just a little bit of déjà vu.

<b>

"I got a bit carried away... Tehepero."

<b>

This is not a 'tehepero' moment!
