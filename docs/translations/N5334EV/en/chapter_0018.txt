# 18 Going Home to Suzy's House

The girl looked like a doll.

<blank>

White, translucent and beautiful skin.

Small, pointed nose.

Small, glossy pink lips.

Eyes that are big and green and sparkling like jewels that seem to suck you in.

<blank>

And hair that shines like rubies peeking out of a hat.

<blank>

<blank>

Such a girl comes running toward Koch.

<blank>

Who in the world is this? While I was frozen, the girl came to the wagon and looked into the back of the wagon...

<blank>

This... is... ts-he-do-boa?"

<blank>

He asked.

<blank>

<blank>

I nodded silently, but immediately....

<blank>

Who are you, ......? Where did you come from?

<blank>

I asked back.

Anita said that in a situation like this, you have to know who you are dealing with first.

<blank>

<blank>

Then the kid looked at Koch, tilting his head a little.

<blank>

I'm Suzy. Mr. Cloud... took me... to... here..."

<blank>

Oh, man! My heart just jumped!

The eyes looking at me are huge!

<blank>

I see! It's called Suzy! O-o-ole, Irving! Uh, Kuh, Mr. Cloud? Oh, yeah! You said you killed this one, didn't you, Mr. Cloud? You're here to see it with me?

<blank>

I kind of rambled on at once, but she nodded a small "yes.

<blank>

<blank>

What... do... you... do... with... this?"

<blank>

The girl, who identified herself as Suzy, asked while poking at the boa skin.

<blank>

What? This? You mean the boa?"

<blank>

He nodded cockily.

<blank>

"Oh, don't think we'll take it to the town hall now ...... and dismantle it right after that."

<blank>

I wonder if her words are a little faltering?

Are you from abroad? Are you a relative of Mr. Cloud?

<blank>

"Do you want to eat? Do you ... eat ... food?"

<blank>

Ah, I knew it was an out-of-country child.

People in this land wouldn't think of eating a hexenbiest!

<blank>

<blank>

I won't eat it! You can't eat a hexenbiest! Don't you know that?"

Can't... eat?

<blank>

He's wide-eyed and amazed.

He really didn't know.

<blank>

When you hunt a beast, you have to bleed it immediately, otherwise the meat loses its flavor, right? After a long time, the smell will come out. In the case of a hexenbiest, you have to do a further process called 'draining the demon'.

<blank>

Without...?

Yes, "without magic! A magical beast is a thing that is incarnated by the miasma in which magical power stagnates and hardens, right? So, if you don't drain out the magic right away, the miasma will continue to stagnate inside. So if you want to eat it, you have to drain the blood and the magic at the same time right away, or else it will stink and be inedible. But even if you can eat it, it's highly unlikely that anyone would try to eat a miasma monster that's made of miasma!

<blank>

When I explained this to him, he looked incredibly depressed.

<blank>

What the hell? Did you want to eat it by any chance? I asked if you were okay.

<blank>

It's okay... nothing... nothing.

<blank>

I returned a powerless smile, though.

<blank>

"Irving... you know... a lot... of... amazing... things."

<blank>

When he said that and smiled at me afterward, my heart jumped with all my might again!

<blank>

I don't think so...z......!

<blank>

Oh, I laughed again. That smile was not good!

<blank>

<blank>

That's why! After these guys are dismantled, the skin and bones can be used if processed, but the meat can't even be used as fertilizer, so we have no choice but to dispose of it!"

"I knew it... Irving... I know... it's... amazing, huh?"

"...... um, yeah. Thanks."

<blank>

<blank>

Oh man, I'm having so much fun! What should I do?

I asked her how old she was and she answered, a little shyly, that she was 13.

You're just like me! When I said that, Susie said...

<blank>

Really? I was surprised.

<blank>

<blank>

I wondered if we were somehow close in age. I thought so, but when I found out we were together, I was extraordinarily happy.

I'd like to talk more about all this, but Suzy is being called by Mr. Cloud.

<blank>

I'm sorry... I have to go... thanks... Irving.

Yeah! See you again!"

Yeah, I'll see you later! See you later!"

<blank>

Suzy went back to Mr. Cloud's place ...... but I feel a strange pressure from Mr. Cloud from earlier.

He has a great smile on his face....

<blank>

Ah! I've had this feeling before!

<blank>

I felt this kind of pressure from Bibi's dad when I went to his house to pick Bibi up during the harvest festival last year!

I remember being strangely scared.

<blank>

Now Mr. Cloud is smiling too, but he's soooo scary. ......

<blank>

But last night when my dad told me to go help Mr. Long early in the morning, I thought it wasn't my lucky day! I thought it wasn't my lucky day when Dad told me to go help Mr. Long early in the morning, but ...... I guess it was my very lucky day!

<blank>

Susie, huh...how long will you be in the village? Hope to see you again. ......

Oh, Fred is looking at Suzy like he's surprised.

Oh, I'm over here, you look like you want to hear something. ...... hehe I'll brag about it!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The Amkam village hall was a bit like a castle.

<blank>

It was originally the residence of a frontier count who ruled the area. Today it is used as it is and serves as the center of the county as well as the administration of the village."

<blank>

August told me as he showed me around the town hall.

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy was ushered into the office of the village chief.

<blank>

Howard was asked to wait here for a while because he had to go through procedures concerning the slaughtered monsters, and August was asked to wait here because he was leaving for a while to make arrangements for a carriage and personnel, so he is sitting alone on the sofa with a basket.

<blank>

I looked around the room with an exhale as I drank the tea made by a woman who said she was the secretary of the village head and said, "Oh....

<blank>

<blank>

It is very unlike the office of the village chief.

The room is of a very stately design and size.

<blank>

Well, it was once a nobleman's castle, so perhaps it is only natural. ...... The ceiling paintings, the intricate carvings on the walls and the hip boards, the gold leaf here and there, I thought, "Is this some kind of palace? I felt like I was sitting on my ass.

<blank>

A little restless like that, sipping a cup of tea, .......

<blank>

(I learned a lot from a kid I met a while ago named Irving... ...... I see...so you can't eat demonic beasts...'demon-less'....is it like eating miasma.... I'm not sure.... Oh, I'm starting to remember what it tastes like...... Oh, I feel like crying... ugh!

Well, then again, that boy said he was 13 years old too. ...... I see, I must look that young myself, so I'm treated like a child~~ .......

(Yes, when the village chief comes back, I should ask him if he has any live-in jobs. (I'm sure there's quite a few jobs like exterminating magical beasts or cleaning up after them, right?)

<blank>

Thinking of this, I continued to sit alone on the sofa in the spacious office.

<blank>

Eventually, Howard and August returned to the Oval Office together.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"I don't work... at a store...?"

Yes, basically, minors under the age of 15 are not allowed to work in this country. Temporary employment is possible, but it requires parental consent and permission."

<blank>

Is this world closer to modern Japan than I thought?

Is the administration solid? If so, is it tough to be on your own at 13?

<blank>

As soon as they returned to the office, Susie asked August if there were any jobs available here that she could work on.

<blank>

Why are you looking for a job?"

<blank>

When August asked back, Suzy glanced at Howard and then....

<blank>

I can't work... I can't... live... with... Mr. Cloud... forever... and ever... no!

<blank>

<blank>

'Susie, did you have that in mind?'

<blank>

Howard stared at Suzy, not even trying to hide his surprise.

<blank>

Cloud... Sonia... Elrose... kind... happy... but... not forever... annoying..."

<blank>

Susie also looks back into Howard's eyes and replies.

<blank>

Susie ...... yes, you were a solid kid...you were."

<blank>

Howard put one hand over his face and exhaled deeply.

<blank>

<blank>

Then August, who had been watching their exchange, opens his mouth.

<blank>

Suzy, in any case, you are now at an age where you need to be educated under the care of a guardian. If you don't have a guardian now, the local government, that is, this village, will be your guarantor. The village will guarantee your life until you reach adulthood, but to do so, you must be protected in the right place."

Is that... Kojiin... or...?"

<blank>

Suzy asked, her face hardening a bit.

<blank>

<blank>

The temple has a shelter for children without parents, although it is not used at this time because there are no such children in the village.

Shinden... Mr. Cloud... nearby.

<blank>

Suzy's expression softened as if relieved.

<blank>

<blank>

August then goes on to add more words.

<blank>

But that's only until ...... someone wants to take you in.

<blank>

and gave Susie a light wink, then smiled at Howard as if to say it was his cue.

<blank>

Suzy looks at August as if surprised.

<blank>

I talked it over with Sonia last night. If it's okay with you, ...... would you like to come live with us?"

<blank>

Suzy stares at Howard, her eyes wide with astonishment.

<blank>

Mr... Cloud?

<blank>

Of course I respect your decision. If you want to go to the city, I will support you. If you want to go to King's Landing, I will provide you with a letter of introduction. If you want to be on your own, I will do everything I can to help you. But if you can ...... stay with us in that house if you can."

"Mr. Cloud? Mr. Cloud! Mr. Cloud! What? What are you... what are you... what are you saying? What?

<blank>

Susie sat up and crowded Howard.

<blank>

Yesterday... I... just... found... it! Where? Who? Who is it? I don't know! And you live with him? No! Never!

<blank>

He blushes, his eyes moisten, and he appeals to Howard.

<blank>

"...... Suzy."

<blank>

<blank>

Howard smiles in annoyance....

<blank>

"Are you worried about us?"

It's obvious! ...anyone...but...I...think..! I don't know... who... my... partner... is... and... you... must... not... go... there... right... now!

<blank>

Susie clenches her fists and appeals to Howard, sniffling and snorting.

<blank>

Howard muttered, "Susie's not a stranger," but Susie glared at him.

<blank>

<blank>

August, who was watching the situation, asked with a slight tear in his eyes.

<blank>

'Susie you don't like the Howard's...the Cloud's?

<blank>

Suzy heard this and turned to Kurn and August, her eyes wide open, "What is this guy talking about?" and just like that....

<blank>

I don't... I don't... I don't..! I don't ... I don't ... I don't ... I don't ... I don't ... I don't like it! I do!

<blank>

<blank>

So you don't like it at the Cloud house?"

That's not ... that's not ... no!

<blank>

Susie placed her hand lightly on her chest, lowered her gaze, and quietly spun her words.

<blank>

Mr. Cloud... a little... cautious... a little... insufficient... I think..! I want more... attention... and I want you to... check... me... more... carefully...

<blank>

Ya, this hurts my ears..., Howard mutters in an amused tone as he scratches his right cheek with his index finger.

<blank>

<blank>

Unable to endure this exchange, August breaks down.

<blank>

Seeing this, Suzy said, "Mm? Why are you laughing? and her mouth curved into a smile.

<blank>

If that's the case, Susie, I'll stay with the Cloud family for a while longer. How about I stay with the Cloud family for a while longer? How about that?

<blank>

And August shows a suggestion.

<blank>

'You need time to think about the future, don't you? It's a time to listen to the opinions of those around you and decide what you want to do in the future. How about it?"

<blank>

Howard gets off the couch, gets down on one knee in front of Susie and looks her in the eye as he speaks.

<blank>

Susie, we don't want to force you to do anything. You can do what you want. We just want to help you do it. ...... that's all."

Mr. Cloud.

<blank>

The table is warm and pleasant with you, and above all, Sonia is very happy. It is our ego that makes us want to spend time with you, and we ask you to indulge us a little.

"I... am... inconvenienced...? ... am I ... disturbing ... you ...?"

<blank>

Suzy asks, looking down, her hands clutching her apron.

<blank>

<blank>

'I told you yesterday. We don't want to bother you, we don't want to be bothered! We want to spend time with you!"

<blank>

Howard responded generously and put his hands on Susie's small shoulders.

<blank>

Ah... Mr. Cloud! I'm... pleased to meet... you... please...

<blank>

Susie blushed and squeezed out the words as she looked at Howard with tear-filled eyes.

<blank>

I'm glad. We have reached an agreement. Then, let's get the paperwork done right away.

<blank>

When August said this, he was giving instructions to his secretary lady.

<blank>

...papers?"

I'm here today to prepare Susie's certificate of residence," Howard said. That's why Mr. Howard came here today.

<blank>

What? Really?　Suzy looks at Howard.

<blank>

Howard smiled back serenely.

<blank>

As of today, Susie's guardian will be Howard. Suzy, who has never had a family name, will now take the last name Cloud!

What? Mr. Cloud... Mr. Cloud?"

<blank>

I pointed to myself as I looked at Howard and asked him a question, and he nodded happily.

<blank>

Welcome! Ms. Suzy Cloud! The village of Amkham welcomes you!"

<blank>

August stands up and shakes Susie's hand, and Susie reflexively takes it...

<blank>

Ah... yes... it's nice to meet you..."

<blank>

He replied.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

While the paperwork was being prepared, the time was approaching noon.

Howard took me out to the garden and said, "Let's have lunch since the rest is taken care of by the staff and there is no problem.

<blank>

The garden extended one level down on the north side of the building.

There is a round flowerbed in the center, and paths lead to it from the east, west, south, and north.

<blank>

The roses were in full bloom until last month, but now they say the irises are in full bloom."

<blank>

Howard told me as we walked through the gardens.

Even though the best time to see the roses had passed, there were still many small roses in the rows, and Suzy was left to marvel at them.

<blank>

<blank>

At the east end, one step up from the garden, was a white gazebo (pavilion).

It was an octagonal building about 3 meters in size, with a common shape of a pillar and a hip roof, but the decoration was magnificent.

<blank>

The roof has another overhanging roof with arched breezeway windows.

The latticework also surrounds the waistboard, and the pillars are finely carved.

It even has ceiling paintings of angels flying around, making it look like a small temple.

Inside, there are benches along the walls and a good-sized table in the middle.

<blank>

Howard took me to have lunch here and we sat down on a bench inside.

<blank>

Looking out from the gazebo to the garden in front....

To the left was the village hall, a former count's mansion on the frontier; to the right was the Deipala Mountains; and in the rear was a panoramic view of the village, since the mansion itself was built on a higher hillside.

<blank>

Susie unfolded the basket and poured the soup she had received from Elrose into a cup and handed it to Howard.

<blank>

Please... Mr. Cloud.

...... Susie, you're a cloud too, okay?"

Oh...uh...Mr. Howard?"

<blank>

Nodding his head in satisfaction, Howard accepted the soup.

<blank>

The venison cutlets are tender and the sweet and spicy sauce is exquisite, making Suzy's cheeks loose and enthralled.

And another bacon vegetable sandwich....

<blank>

This is! Is that lettuce and tomatoes? It's a BLT!

<blank>

Oh! This sour dressing! It stimulates both sides of my tongue! I wonder how long I could go on eating it, alternating with a pork cutlet sandwich, with its crispy, crunchy, and dry texture!

<blank>

Howard looks lovingly at Suzy, who is happily eating two sandwiches...

<blank>

I have loved the view from here since I was a child. It is like my original landscape. The rice paddies that spread out around us were quiet, and the Deipala in the north always watched over us from a great distance.

<blank>

Susie holds a cutlet sandwich in both hands and chews it with a moxie, looking up at Howard and listening to his story.

<blank>

<blank>

But today's Deipala is not the heroic figure she once was! Its body has been gouged by cruel claw marks, and even Mother Dare is exposing herself in a disastrous manner.

The strange change in Daypara that happened three days ago. Was it the wrath of God? The descent of an evil god? Either way, the impact it will have on the world is too immeasurable.

The Great Forest of Irosio, which spreads out at the foot of the forest, will probably undergo some changes in the not-too-distant future. And of course, the world itself. We must be prepared for the threats that will eventually come.

<blank>

Howard spoke powerfully and quietly.

<blank>

Suzy heard this and....

<blank>

<blank>

His face is pale.

<blank>

ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ! and a grand blood curdling sound was heard!

<blank>

(Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

I am not a god! I'm not an evil god either! I didn't know this was going to happen! I didn't know it was going to be like this! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Please bear with me! Please forgive me... ！！！！ (Hee～～～～～～～～～～～～)

<blank>

He was shedding tears of blood like a waterfall on the inside, and was earnestly begging for forgiveness.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard noticed Suzy's pale face....

<blank>

'Ya, did I scare you with this? I'm sorry. You may have just gotten caught in the middle of all this but rest assured, your peace of mind while you're here is in good hands. Your peace of mind while you're here is guaranteed by us at ......! I guarantee it! You can go on with your life and not worry about anything. That's all that matters."

<blank>

Howard spoke softly to Suzy with eyes filled with compassion.

<blank>

(Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! It's me! I am the cause! I am the root of all evil!)

<blank>

Suzy, who was spoken to, is rolling around, full of guilt.

<blank>

<blank>

Despite being blamed for such guilt and heartache, both the BLT and the cutlet sandwich were nicely flattened.

<blank>

(Kuhhhhhhhh ...... my, my own healing is so mouth-watering.......!

Nope! This is Ms. Sonia's love! Ms. Sonia's love has brought healing to this desolate chasm in my heart! Thank you, Mama Sonia! You are my Bodhisattva!)

<blank>

With this kind of incomprehensible logic, I forced my consciousness back to reality.

<blank>

<blank>

After cleaning up the meal, we returned to the town hall and left the building after Howard and August had a brief meeting in the office.

<blank>

When I went outside, I saw that Frank and his friends had just entered the town hall grounds in a horse-drawn carriage loaded with boas and wolves.

<blank>

Howard approached the wagon and inspected Wolf's wreckage, then snorted loudly and shifted his gaze to Susie. Susie noticed Howard's gaze and again began to sweat down her back, but she opened her eyebrows in relief when Howard exchanged a word or two with Frank and the others and then sent the wagon with Wolf on its way.

<blank>

Irving was about to run to Suzy when another boy grabbed him by the neck and dragged him away, while Suzy looked on in wonder.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I arrived at the Cloud residence, Sonia was waiting for me at the entrance.

<blank>

Suzy, after being unloaded from the carriage, walks straight up to Sonia and greets her with a bashful smile as if she is about to return home.

<blank>

I'm home.

Welcome back, Susie.

<blank>

Sonia smiled and opened her arms to welcome Suzy.

Thank you for reading.

Another new development in the next issue! It must be a school story?
