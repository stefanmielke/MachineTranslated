# Chapter 18: Returning to the Suzy Family

The girl looked just like a doll.

<b>

Her skin was beautifully white and translucent.

A small, pointed nose.

Small, glossy pink lips.

Large, sparkling green eyes that looked like precious gems.

<b>

And hair that shone like rubies peeking out from under her hat.

<b>

<b>

That girl was running towards me.

<b>

Who on earth is she? While I was frozen in place, she reached the wagon and peered into the cargo...

<b>

"Is this... the two-headed boa?"

<b>

she asked.

<b>

<b>

I nodded silently, but immediately...

<b>

"Wait... who are you? Where did you come from...?"

<b>

I asked back.

My brother had said that you need to know who the other person is first in situations like this.

<b>

<b>

Then she looked at me, tilting her head slightly.

<b>

"I'm... Suzy. ...Cloud-san... brought... me... here..."

<b>

Oh no! My heart just jumped!

Her eyes looking at me are so huge!!

<b>

"R-really! Your name is Suzy!? I-I’m Arvin! Um, C-Cloud-san? Right! He said he caught this! You came to see it with him!?"

<b>

I blurted out all at once, but she nodded softly with a small "Mm."

<b>

<b>

"What... will you do... with this?"

<b>

The girl who introduced herself as Suzy asked while poking the boa's skin.

<b>

"Huh? Th-this? About the boa?"

<b>

She nodded.

<b>

"Ah, I think we’ll take it to the town hall... and then dismantle it right away."

<b>

Her words seemed a bit hesitant, didn’t they?

Did she come from a foreign country? A relative of Cloud-san?

<b>

"Dismantle? ...Will you... eat... it?"

<b>

Ah, she really is from abroad.

People from this land wouldn’t think about eating magical beasts!

<b>

<b>

"We won't eat it! Magical beasts can't be eaten! Didn't you know?"

"Can't... eat?"

<b>

Her eyes widened in surprise.

It seems she really didn't know.

<b>

"If you hunt normal beasts, you have to bleed them right away, or the meat loses its flavor, right? If you wait too long, it starts to smell. With magical beasts, you have to do something called 'magic extraction' right away."

<b>

"Ma...gic extraction?"

"Yes, 'magic extraction'! Magical beasts are formed from the solidified miasma of stagnant magical power, right? So if you don't extract the magic power immediately, the miasma will keep accumulating inside. So if you want to eat it, you have to bleed it and extract the magic at the same time, or it will smell so bad you can't eat it. Besides, even if it could be eaten, there are probably no humans who would try to eat a magical beast made of miasma!"

<b>

When I explained, her face looked incredibly downcast.

<b>

What’s wrong? Did she want to eat it? I asked if she was okay.

<b>

"Um... I'm fine... it's nothing..."

<b>

She replied with a weak smile.

<b>

"Arvin... you know a lot... that's amazing..."

<b>

When she said that with a smile, my heart jumped again!

<b>

"N-no, that's not true...!!!"

<b>

Oh, she smiled again. That smile is dangerous!

<b>

<b>

"So, after we dismantle these, we can use the skin and bones, but the meat can't even be used for fertilizer, so we have to dispose of it!"

"Really... Arvin... you know... that's amazing...?"

"Um, yeah. Th-thank you."

<b>

<b>

This is so much fun! What should I do?

When I asked her age, she shyly replied that she was 13.

That's the same as me!! When I said that, Suzy looked surprised.

<b>

"Really?" she said, surprised.

<b>

<b>

Is our age close? I thought, but knowing we’re the same age made me even happier.

Just as I was thinking I wanted to talk more, Suzy was called by Cloud-san.

<b>

"Sorry... I have to go... thank you... Arvin."

"Ah! Let’s meet again!"

"Yeah! ...See you!"

<b>

Suzy went back to Cloud-san... but I’ve been feeling a strange pressure from Cloud-san since a while ago.

His face is really cheerful, though...

<b>

Ah! This feeling, I’ve experienced it before!

<b>

Last year during the harvest festival, when I went to pick Vivi up, I felt this kind of pressure from Vivi's dad!

I remember it being really scary.

<b>

Now Cloud-san is smiling, but it’s super scary...

<b>

B-but last night my dad told me to help Long-san early in the morning! I thought I was unlucky, but... maybe I was really lucky!?

<b>

I wonder how long Suzy will stay in the village? I hope I can see her again...

Oh, Fred looks surprised as he watches Suzy.

Oh, he’s coming over, he seems to want to ask something... heh, I’ll show off!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The Amukam Village Town Hall looked like a small castle.

<b>

"This was originally the residence of the border lord who governed this land. It is currently used as not only the village administration but also serves as the center of the county."

<b>

I was told this by August as he guided me through the town hall.

<b>

<b>

Suzy was taken to the mayor's office.

<b>

Howard had some paperwork regarding the slain magical beast, and August said he would arrange the wagon and personnel, so he asked her to wait here for a while, leaving her alone with a basket on the sofa.

<b>

Drinking the tea that the mayor's secretary, a woman, had brewed, I looked around the room and sighed, "Wow..."

<b>

<b>

It didn’t look like a mayor's office at all.

It was a room with a very heavy and spacious design.

<b>

Well, since it was originally a noble's castle, that might be expected... The ceiling paintings, the intricate carvings on the walls and wainscoting, and gold leaf applied here and there made me think, "Is this a palace or something?" and it felt quite uncomfortable to sit.

<b>

While I was sipping my tea a bit nervously...

<b>

(I learned a lot from that boy Arvin earlier... So magical beasts can’t be eaten... "magic extraction"... it's like eating miasma... Ah, I think I’m starting to remember the taste... Oh, I feel like crying... ugh!

By the way, that boy said he was 13... I see, I must look that young too, no wonder I’m treated like a child...

Oh, when the mayor comes back, should I ask if there are any live-in jobs available? There seem to be quite a few jobs for hunting magical beasts and cleaning up, right?)

<b>

I continued to sit alone on the spacious office sofa, lost in thought.

<b>

Eventually, Howard and August returned to the office together.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Is it true... you can't work...?"

"That's right. Basically, in this country, minors under 15 years old cannot be employed. Temporary employment is possible, but it requires the consent and permission of a guardian."

<b>

Is this world surprisingly close to modern Japan?

Is the administration well-organized? If so, then becoming independent at 13 is tough?

<b>

As soon as the two returned to the office, Suzy asked August if there were any jobs she could do here.

<b>

"Why are you looking for a job?"

<b>

When August asked back, Suzy glanced at Howard before...

<b>

"I can't... live... without... working... I can't keep... relying... on Cloud-san!"

<b>

<b>

"Suzy, were you thinking about that?"

<b>

Howard looked at Suzy, unable to hide his surprise.

<b>

"Cloud-san... Sonia-san... Elrose-san... are kind... I'm happy... but... I can't keep... being a burden..."

<b>

Suzy looked back into Howard's eyes and answered.

<b>

"Suzy... that's right, you are a responsible child... indeed."

<b>

Howard placed a hand on his face and let out a deep sigh.

<b>

<b>

At that moment, August, who had been watching their exchange, spoke up.

<b>

"Suzy, in any case, you are at an age where you must receive education under a guardian. Since you currently have no guardian, the local administration, meaning this village, will become your custodian. Until you reach adulthood, your living will be guaranteed by this village, but for that, you must be protected in an appropriate place."

"Is that... like an orphanage?"

<b>

Suzy asked, her expression hardening slightly.

<b>

<b>

"There are currently no children in this village who fit that description, so it is not being used, but there is a facility in the temple to protect children without parents."

"The temple... is close to Cloud-san."

<b>

Suzy's expression softened as if relieved.

<b>

<b>

August continued to add more words.

<b>

"However, that is until someone appears who wants to take you in."

<b>

He winked at Suzy lightly and smiled at Howard as if to say, "It's your turn now."

<b>

Suzy looked at August in surprise.

<b>

"Suzy, I discussed this with Sonia last night. If you’re okay with it... would you like to live with us?"

<b>

Suzy's eyes widened in shock as she stared at Howard.

<b>

"...Cloud...san?"

<b>

"Of course, your will will be respected. If you want to go to the city, we will support you. If you wish to go to the royal capital, we will prepare a letter of introduction. If you wish to become independent, we want to help you as much as we can. But if possible... if you can, we would like you to stay with us in that house."

"Cloud-san? ...Cloud-san!? ...Cloud-san!!? ...What? ...What are you... saying?! ...?"

<b>

Suzy stood up and approached Howard.

<b>

"I just... met you... yesterday! ...Who? ...What? ...I don’t know you! ...Living together? ...No! ...Absolutely not!!"

<b>

Her face flushed, and her eyes glistened as she pleaded with Howard.

<b>

"Suzy..."

<b>

<b>

Howard smiled awkwardly...

<b>

"Are you worried about us?"

"Of course...! ...Anyone... would think so! ...I can’t trust... someone I don’t know... right away!!"

<b>

Suzy exclaimed, her breath heavy, fists clenched as she pleaded with Howard.

<b>

Howard murmured, "Suzy is not a stranger," but Suzy glared at him.

<b>

<b>

August, who was watching this scene, asked with a slight smile.

<b>

"Do you dislike Howard... or the Cloud family, Suzy?"

<b>

Hearing that, Suzy turned to August with wide eyes, as if to say, "What is this person talking about?"

<b>

"I don’t! ...I don’t dislike them...!!!"

<b>

<b>

"Then, you don’t dislike the Cloud family?"

"That’s not... what I meant!!"

<b>

Suzy placed her lightly clenched hand on her chest, lowered her gaze, and quietly spoke.

<b>

"I think... Cloud-san... is a bit... too hasty... I want to... be more certain... before... living together..."

<b>

Ouch, that stings... Howard scratched his right cheek with his index finger, mumbling apologetically.

<b>

<b>

Unable to bear this exchange, August broke into a smile.

<b>

Seeing that, Suzy pouted, "Huh? Why are you laughing?"

<b>

"If that's the case, Suzy. How about you stay with the Cloud family for a little longer as you are now?"

<b>

August suggested.

<b>

"You will need time to think about the future, right? You can listen to various opinions around you and decide what you want to do moving forward. How does that sound?"

<b>

Howard got off the sofa, knelt in front of Suzy to match her eye level, and spoke to her.

<b>

"Suzy, we don’t want to force you. You can do as you like. We just want to help you... that’s all."

"Cloud-san..."

<b>

"The dining table with you is fun and warm, and Sonia looks genuinely happy... Wanting to spend time with you is our selfish desire. Please indulge us just a little in that selfishness?"

"I... won’t be a burden... right? ...I won’t be in the way... right?"

<b>

Suzy asked, looking down, her hands gripping her apron tightly.

<b>

<b>

"I told you yesterday, right? You’re not a burden or in the way! We want to spend time with you!"

<b>

Howard replied cheerfully, placing both hands on Suzy's small shoulders.

<b>

"Ah... Cloud-san! ...I... I would like to... please take care of me!"

<b>

Suzy blushed, tears welling in her eyes as she squeezed out her words.

<b>

"Good. It seems we have reached an agreement. Now, let’s get the paperwork done right away."

<b>

Saying that, August instructed the secretary woman.

<b>

"...Paperwork?"

"Creating your resident registration, Suzy. Howard came here today for that purpose."

<b>

Huh? Is that so? Suzy looked at Howard.

<b>

Howard smiled back gently.

<b>

"From today, your guardian will be Howard. Since you didn’t have a family name, you will now take the surname Cloud!"

"…Huh? ...Cloud-san... Cloud-san?"

<b>

As she pointed at herself while looking at Howard, he nodded happily.

<b>

"Welcome! Suzy Cloud! Amukam Village welcomes you!"

<b>

August stood up and reached out for a handshake, and Suzy reflexively took his hand...

<b>

"Ah... yes... nice to meet you..."

<b>

she replied.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As the paperwork was being prepared, it was getting close to lunchtime.

Since there was no problem leaving it to the staff, Howard took me to the garden for lunch.

<b>

The garden was laid out in a slightly lower area on the north side of the building.

There was a round flower bed in the center, with paths leading to it from the east, west, south, and north.

<b>

"The roses were in full bloom until last month, but now the irises are in full bloom."

<b>

Howard told me as we walked through the garden.

Even though the roses had passed their peak, there were still plenty of small ones blooming, and Suzy was constantly exclaiming in admiration.

<b>

<b>

At the east end, there was a white gazebo raised one step above the garden.

It was an octagonal shape about three meters wide, with pillars and wainscoting supporting the roof, a common shape but beautifully decorated.

<b>

The roof had another layer with arched ventilation windows.

The wainscoting was lattice-like, surrounding it completely, and the pillars had intricate carvings.

There was even a ceiling painting of angels flying, making it look like a small temple.

Inside, benches were set along the walls, and there was a moderately sized table in the center.

<b>

We decided to have lunch here, and I sat down on one of the benches inside.

<b>

From the gazebo, looking out at the garden...

To the left was the former residence of the border lord, the village hall, to the right was the Deipara mountain range, and behind us, since this residence was built on a higher hill, we could see the entire village.

<b>

Suzy opened the basket, poured the soup she received from Elrose into a cup, and handed it to Howard.

<b>

"Here you go... Cloud-san."

"…Suzy, you’re also a Cloud now, you know?"

"Ah... um... H-Howard-san?"

<b>

Nodding contentedly, Howard accepted the soup.

<b>

The venison cutlet was tender, and the sweet and spicy sauce was exquisite, making Suzy's cheeks relax as she became engrossed in it.

And the other was a bacon vegetable sandwich...

<b>

Isn’t this lettuce and tomato!? This is a BLT!

<b>

Ah! This tangy dressing! It stimulates both sides of my tongue!! The crunchy, refreshing taste makes me feel like I could eat it forever, alternating with the cutlet sandwich!!

<b>

As I watched Suzy happily munching on both sandwiches, Howard said...

<b>

"Since I was a child, I’ve loved the view from here. It’s like my original scenery. The fields spreading around are peaceful, and the towering Deipara always watched over us from afar."

<b>

Suzy held the cutlet sandwich with both hands, munching away while looking up at Howard, listening to his story.

<b>

<b>

"But now, Deipara has lost its once majestic appearance! Its body is scarred with terrible wounds, and even Mother Dear is tragically exposed.

The disturbance in Deipara three days ago. Was it the wrath of the gods? The descent of an evil god? In any case, the impact it brings to the world is immeasurable.

There will soon be some change in the vast Iroshio Great Forest that spreads at its foot. Of course, it will affect the world itself. We must prepare for the threats that will eventually come."

<b>

Howard spoke strongly and quietly.

<b>

Listening to him, Suzy...

<b>

<b>

Looked pale.

<b>

I could hear the sound of blood draining away with a loud "Zuzazazaza!!!"

<b>

(I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!

I’m not a god! I’m not an evil god!! I didn’t know this would happen! I didn’t realize it would turn into such a fuss!!! I’m so sorry! Please forgive me! Please let me off the hook!!! Hiiiii~~~~~~~)

<b>

Inside, I was shedding tears of blood like a waterfall, desperately pleading for forgiveness.

<b>

<b>

Noticing Suzy's pale face, Howard...

<b>

"Did I scare you? I’m sorry. You might have just been caught up in this... but please rest assured. Your peace while you are here is something we... no! I will guarantee! You just need to live without worrying about anything. That’s all you need to do."

<b>

Howard spoke gently to Suzy with eyes full of compassion.

<b>

(Ah, ah, ah, ah! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! It’s my fault! I’m the root of all evil!!!)

<b>

Being spoken to, Suzy was beaten down by guilt, rolling around in her mind.

<b>

<b>

Despite being tormented by such guilt and pain, she managed to finish both the BLT and the cutlet sandwich.

<b>

(How frustrating... my own gluttony is infuriating!!

No! This is Sonia-san's love! Sonia-san's love has brought healing to this desolate heart! Thank you, Sonia-mama!! You are my bodhisattva!)

<b>

With such incomprehensible reasoning, I forcibly brought my consciousness back to reality.

<b>

<b>

After cleaning up the meal, we returned to the town hall, and after a brief meeting between Howard and August in the office, we left the building.

<b>

As we stepped outside, Frank and the others had just entered the town hall grounds with a wagon loaded with the boa and wolf.

<b>

Howard approached the wagon and examined the wolf's carcass, then let out a deep growl and shifted his gaze to Suzy. Noticing Howard's gaze, Suzy began to sweat again, but after Howard exchanged a word or two with Frank and the others, he let the wagon carrying the wolf go, and she sighed in relief.

<b>

Arvin, who had spotted Suzy, was trying to run over, but was grabbed by another boy and dragged away, which Suzy watched curiously, and then the two left the village hall.

<b>

<b>

<b>

When they arrived at the Cloud residence, Sonia was waiting at the entrance.

<b>

After being helped down from the wagon, Suzy walked straight up to Sonia and greeted her with a shy smile.

<b>

"...I’m home."

"Welcome back, Suzy."

<b>

Sonia smiled and opened her arms to welcome Suzy.

Thank you for reading.

Next time, a new development! It’s sure to be a school story?!
