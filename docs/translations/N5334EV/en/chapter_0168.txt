# Episode 156: Aftermath? Accident Handling?

It is a well-known story that the land of this academy was originally the site of a noble's mansion.

After the original noble owner was disinherited, the first to purchase this land was the temple office, and it was said to have been used as a temple facility for a while.

It is also a well-known fact that the school building currently used by the theology department was the great temple of that time.

Additionally, many of the lecture halls and facilities are said to be repurposed from the temple facilities that were once chapels.

<b>

Perhaps because of this, there are still priests coming and going within the academy, and some parts naturally retain their function as a temple.

This is also why theology classes can be taken at the academy.

<b>

There is one role of the temple that I have known for quite some time.

<b>

That is the role of protecting children without parents.

<b>

On that day, the two managers of the infamous Purple House never returned to the facility.

In the afternoon of that day, two bodies, a man and a woman, were found drowned in the Maguarat River.

Their faces were unrecognizable, but it was probably without a doubt the two managers in question.

Anna Mary said they were likely caught up in this unfortunate mess.

<b>

Because of this, the children from the facility were temporarily taken to the Amukam Consulate, arranged by Uncle Philip.

Once the administrative procedures are completed, they will be sent to a new facility in order.

This time, it is said to be a reliable facility managed by the Dekkenbel municipality.

<b>

The twins have been decided to be transferred to the nursery managed by the temple within the academy.

<b>

Originally, they were supposed to enter there from the beginning, but somehow they ended up going to an external private facility... 

Now, it seems that a little time is needed for the administrative procedures to return things to their rightful state.

During that time, the twins will continue to be cared for at the consulate.

<b>

Even so, Uncle Philip told me that they should be able to move into the academy's facility within this week.

<b>

Karen had received permission to stay overnight at the Amukam Consulate so that she could be with the twins until they moved to the academy.

It seems that the academy's director himself was considerate enough not to separate them from their only living relatives in such a situation.

He is quite a thoughtful person.

Although I haven't met him yet, it goes without saying that my favorability toward the director has skyrocketed.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Oh? Sue, how are you?"

"Lady Carrie! I-I’m well."

"You still look adorable as ever, Sue."

"…I-I’m honored."

"Are you not wearing your party mask today?"

"Ha-gyu!"

"That's right! My father asked me to apologize to you if I met you, Sue."

"Uhi-gi?!"

"I'm sorry, Sue. Men tend to value their appearance, so sometimes they insist on unreasonable things. I’ve told him firmly, so please let this one slide."

"S-Such! I-I am the one who has been terribly rude…!"

"Oh my! Thank you, Sue! You will forgive me?! I'm so happy!"

"Ha-myu-gyu!"

"Next time there’s a party mask event at the shop, please let me know. I will definitely attend."

"Ah, uh…"

<b>

<b>

"Why did you think wearing a mask would prevent you from being recognized?"

"U-gi!"

"After all, it was the shop's uniform, so I think it would be obvious who you are."

"Ha-gyu-gyu!"

<b>

Stop it already――! My mental life has long been at zero!!!

I couldn't help but hold my head in my hands, only able to writhe in shame.

On that day, my black history was born.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

On that day, at that time, in that place, after that...

<b>

As I was burning the waste, Arvin and Karen caught up with me.

<b>

However, they were not the only two who came.

The guards and knights from Dekkenbel also came in droves.

Well, it seems the smoke was rising like a signal fire, so that served as a landmark...

<b>

The knights also seemed to have sensed that magical beasts were gathering nearby and were investigating it.

<b>

Then, I informed them that "the one we are burning now is the last one, so there is no problem."

However, when they confirmed that this one was still alive, they insisted on handing it over.

What are these guys talking about? I thought, as I politely declined with, "Huh? No, thank you."

<b>

Of course, right?

We ended up in this situation because I let one go before; I won't make the same mistake again.

<b>

When Arvin looked at me as if to say, "How long are you going to keep burning it?" I nodded and said, "I will turn it to ash right away."

I’m not particularly clingy, nor do I have any intention of dragging this out.

<b>

Alright, let's turn it to ash! As I raised my magical power, a voice called out, "Please wait a moment!"

<b>

It was someone among the guards and knights surrounding us, who was clearly of the highest rank.

Their equipment was flashy.

They wore full-body armor adorned with silver gold and red gold lines on the gauntlets and shoulders. The way the lines were arranged seemed to indicate rank, and while flashy, it looked very cool. They could only be seen as a commander class.

<b>

This person said, "It is unprecedented for magical beasts to be unleashed in the city of Dekkenbel. We must capture the main culprit of this commotion at all costs. Interrogation is essential for clarifying the matter."

So, they asked me to hand over the living one.

<b>

Even if they said that, there was no way I would just hand over the one that had done that to Annie.

<b>

"I have already received reports that you have exterminated the magical beasts and saved the lives of the citizens and my subordinates. I would like to express my gratitude once again. With that said, would you please hand it over to us?"

"This will be dealt with here and now."

"You scoundrel! Your offer!!"

"What is it?"

"――――！！！！"

<b>

Naturally, when I coldly replied, "No, thank you," one of the knights started to act all tough.

So, when I gave them a glare, they started foaming at the mouth and fell over.

<b>

Then the surrounding guards and knights took a few steps back, but the commander did not move an inch and still said, "I beg you."

What a composed person... I thought, impressed, when Arvin tugged at my sleeve.

"What is it?" I looked over, and Arvin quietly said, "That is probably the head of the Dekkenbel Defense Organization."

<b>

How does Arvin know such a thing?

I didn’t quite understand, but when I asked with my eyes, "Cool your head. It’s not good to cause problems by pushing back here. It will inconvenience the consul general and embarrass your head," I was shocked to hear Arvin tell me to cool my head! From Arvin!

That was quite a shock, but more than that, I had no words to respond to such a statement.

I certainly couldn’t inconvenience Uncle Philip or even Papa Howard.

<b>

I relaxed my shoulders and let out a long, long sigh.

Reluctantly, I kicked the still smoldering thing toward the knights.

But I wouldn’t forget to say something.

<b>

"When that fire goes out, it will begin to regenerate. I think it will continue to burn for about a week, but after that, you will have to manage it yourselves. Oh, and if you touch it directly, it will catch fire on you as well, so it would be better to stab it with an iron skewer and carry it, okay?"

"Thank you! I appreciate your consideration!"

"…Please just promise me one thing. Do not ever release it from its cage."

<b>

If I sense its presence in the city, I will immediately turn it to dust without question.

The commander said, "I will certainly meet your expectations," and led the guards and knights away.

<b>

<b>

What a troublesome ending, I thought, pouting when Arvin dropped a bombshell from the side.

<b>

"That was Robert Randall Goldberg, the head of the Defense Organization. As Caroline's father, he was quite an imposing figure."

<b>

Haaah?!!

Lady Carrie’s father, you sayーーーー?!!!

Isn't that the former duke himselfーーーー?！！

I hadn’t heard such a thing?！！

<b>

"What? You didn’t know?"

<b>

Of course, I wouldn’t know!!

<b>

Seeing my eyes wide open, Arvin looked at me with an exasperated expression.

<b>

Ugh! For the second time, was I questioned about common sense by Arvin?!

What a humiliation!!

<b>

But! More than that, I was overwhelmed by the fact that I had just messed up.

The kindness of Karen, who gently placed her hand on my shoulder as I continued to groan in agony, strangely resonated with me.
