# 156 Episode 156 After-the-Fact Processing? Accidental Disposal?

It is well known that the land of this school was originally the site of a nobleman's mansion.

The Temple Authority was the first to purchase this land after the original owner, a nobleman, was disinherited, and it was used as a temple facility for a while.

It is also known that the school building now used by the theology department was the great temple of the time.

The other facilities, such as the auditorium, are said to have been reused from the chapel and other temple facilities of the time.

<blank>

Perhaps that is why priests still come and go in the school, and part of it still maintains its function as a temple, as it should.

That's why you can take theology classes at the school.

<blank>

There is one role of the temple that I have known for a long time.

<blank>

It's role is to protect children without parents.

<blank>

The two caretakers of the Purple House, for example, never returned to the facility that day.

The drowned bodies of two people, a man and a woman, were reportedly raised in the Maguarat River in the early afternoon of that day.

Although their faces were not in a condition to be recognized, there was no doubt that they were probably the two janitors.

I must have been unlucky to get caught up in this mess, AnnaMarie said.

<blank>

Because of this, the children at the institution were temporarily placed in the care of the Consulate of Amcam, arranged by Uncle Philip.

They will go to the new facility in the order in which the paperwork is completed.

This time it's a solid facility, managed by the municipality of De Kembel.

<blank>

It was decided that the twins would be transferred to an infant house managed by the school's temple.

<blank>

Originally, they were supposed to go in there, but somehow they ended up going to an outside private facility. ......

Right now, they need a little more time with the paperwork to get it back to the way it should be.

In the meantime, the twins will remain in the care of the consulate.

<blank>

Nevertheless, my uncle told me that I should be able to enter a facility within the school by the end of this week.

<blank>

Karen was given permission to stay outside at the Amcam consulate so that she could stay with the twins until they moved into the school.

It is said that the school's president himself made the decision not to separate the students from their only living relatives under such circumstances.

He is a man of great chic.

Needless to say, my liking for the chancellor has skyrocketed, even though I have yet to meet him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh? Sue, how are you?"

"Dear Carrie! Good day, sir."

"Lovely as ever, isn't she? Sue."

"...... Oh, I'm so sorry."

'Are you not going to wear your party mask today?'

Squeeze!"

'Yes, yes! Your father asked me to apologize to Sue when I see her."

"Ohhiggity?

I'm sorry, Sue. Men are always so concerned with appearances that they sometimes try to force their way through unreasonable things. I have given him a stern talking-to, so please let him off the hook this time.

Oh, no! Oh, I am in awe! I'm the one who's very rude, ......!"

Well! Thank you Sue! You forgive me, don't you? I'm so happy!"

HAMIMYU!"

I will definitely come again next time you have a party mask event at your restaurant. I'll be there for sure.

Aww, aww. ......"

<blank>

<blank>

What makes you think you can wear a mask and not be identified?"

"Oogie!"

I think they could easily figure out where I was from, since I was wearing a store uniform."

Hugs!"

<blank>

Stop it already! My mental life has already reached zero!

I can only hold my head up and writhe in shame.

That day, a black history was born in me.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

That day, that time, that place, that after. ......

<blank>

As they were burning the filth, Irving and Karen caught up with them.

<blank>

But they were not the only two who came there.

The guards and knights belonging to Dekenberu also came in droves.

Well, the smoke was rising like a wolfsbane, so they said it was a landmark. ......

<blank>

I heard that the knights had also sensed that demonic beasts were gathering near here, and they were searching for them.

<blank>

And I told him, "The one I'm burning now is the last one, so it's no longer a problem.

However, when they confirmed that this guy was still alive, they demanded that he hand it over to them.

What are they talking about? I thought to myself, "What? I don't want to do it. I politely declined.

<blank>

Isn't it obvious?

We missed it before and got into this mess, and we're not going to make the same mistake, okay?

<blank>

Irving looked at me like, "How long are you going to keep burning it?" I nodded my head and said, "I'll burn it right away.

I'm not a clingy person, and I have no intention of going on like this for too long.

<blank>

Now, let's turn them into ashes! I raised my magical power a little, and a voice said, "Wait a while! I heard a voice saying, "Hold on a moment!

<blank>

Among the guards and knights surrounding us, he was the one with the most distinguished appearance, which was obvious at a glance.

After all, the equipment was fancy.

It is a full-body gilded armor with silver-gold and red-gold lines on the gauntlets and shoulders. The lines seem to indicate rank, and although gaudy, they are very cool. It looks like nothing but a commanding officer.

<blank>

And the person said, "It is unprecedented that a magical beast is released in the city of Dekenberu. We want to find the main culprit of this disturbance at any cost. We need to interrogate him to find out what happened.

So, if he is alive, he wants us to hand him over.

<blank>

Even if they told me that, there was no way I would hand over this guy who did that to Annie.

<blank>

I have already received reports of your success in exterminating the monsters and saving the lives of citizens and my men. Let me thank you again. "I would like to thank you again, and ask you to hand them over to us.

I'll take care of it right here and now.

'You! Sir's offer!"

Yes?"

"----！！！！"

<blank>

Naturally, I said coldly, "I don't want to. I said coldly, "I don't want to," and one of the knightly men started to make a fuss about something.

So, I gave him a quick glare, and he blew bubbles and turned over.

<blank>

Then all the knights of the guard around us took a few steps back, but only the commander did not move a single step, still saying, "Please do me a favor.

I was impressed that he is a moderately determined person ......, and Irving comes tugging at my sleeve with his choy choy choy.

What? When I turned to look at him, Irving came to me in a whisper, "That's probably the general manager of the De Kembel Defense Organization.

<blank>

How would Irving know that?

I don't understand well, but so what? I asked him with my eyes, "Cool your head. It's not good to cause a problem by poking and prodding here. It will cause trouble for the consul general and it will not help your head of state. Irving told me to cool my head! Irving!

That was a huge shock, but more importantly, I was at a loss for words to return such a statement.

I can't be bothered with Uncle Philip or even Papa Howard.

<blank>

Shoulders relaxed, a long, long sigh escapes my mouth.

I kicked it, which was still covered with fire, in the direction of the knights.

But I'll remember to tell you.

<blank>

Once the fire is extinguished, it will begin to regenerate. It will continue to burn for about a week, but after that, you will have to take care of it yourselves. If you touch it directly, you will catch fire yourself, so it is better to carry it on an iron skewer, okay?

Thank you! I appreciate your concern!"

"...... promise me you won't let him out of his cage. I will never release him from his cage."

<blank>

I have expressed my intention to return her to the dust at that moment, without question, if I detect her presence in the city.

The commander stated, "I will certainly meet your expectations," and left with the guard knights in tow.

<blank>

<blank>

As I was thinking, "What an awkward end," my mouth was bent into a grimace, when Irving dropped a bomb from the side.

<blank>

That's Robert Randall Goldberg, the head of the defense establishment. He was a powerful man, just like Master Caroline's father.

<blank>

Huh?

He is Carrie's father?

Isn't that the old duke himself!

I never heard of such a thing, but?

<blank>

"What? You didn't get it?"

<blank>

I don't understand!

<blank>

Seeing me with my eyes peeled back, Irving looks at me with a look of dismay.

<blank>

Kuh! Not once, not even twice, has Irving questioned your common sense?

What a humiliation!

<blank>

But! More than anything else, that's not the point! I'm mindful of the fact that I've just done it.

Karen's kindness, as she gently placed her hand on my shoulder as I continued to moan in agony, was strangely poignant.
