# 53 The End of Suzy Cloud's Ritual

That day, I woke up at sunrise, had a quick breakfast, and cleared the encampment.

<blank>

I folded up the tent and put the dishes and tools I had brought in my backpack.

We won't forget the souvenir horned rabbit meat and Crowler's thread.

In the end, the thread ball ended up in three volumes in all!

You feel like I've squeezed you clean to the end? Hmph...

<blank>

After packing up our belongings, we need to organize this place we have made into an encampment.

Break the hearth and fill the hole that was dug.

The cut grass and trees won't grow back today or tomorrow, but they will be back to their original bushes soon, in less than a month.

<blank>

That is the Amcam forest.

If we are careless, it will encroach on human habitation...this is truly a forest of evil.

<blank>

It is not for the sake of preserving nature or anything like that, but for the sake of the children who will be tested in the future.

In other words, don't take advantage of the marks left by your predecessors and don't make it easy for them, show them what you can do! That's what I mean.

It's a very heavy Amkam village, isn't it?

<blank>

After cleaning up the remains of the encampment, we went downstairs and headed back toward the Tsumesho.

<blank>

We stopped at a place where the stakes were lined up in the safe zone where we had split off from Aria and her friends on the first day.

After a while, Aria and her friends arrived.

<blank>

Aria, who confirmed my presence, grinned at me and threw me a manly smile.

I smiled back at that, and Mr. Ketty raised his arm and shot out his magic.

The magic shot out makes a series of light popping sounds in the sky above.

It sounds like something out of a field day.

<blank>

This is a wolf signal that the ordeal is over, he said.

After looking up at the fireworks-like wolf smoke, I started walking back toward the station.

Aria and the others will follow me.

<blank>

When we eventually emerged onto the plaza north of the Tsumesho, we were greeted by Alphonse and several members of the group in front of the Tsumesho, just as he had greeted us when he saw us off.

<blank>

Welcome back, Miss Susie."

Susie Cloud, I'm back!

<blank>

When I returned the welcome, Mr. Alphonse nodded with a smile.

He led us directly into the Tsumesho, and we arrived at a small conference room with the same temple sign as the one we had been taken to before our departure.

<blank>

Just like a week ago, Mr. Alphonse stood in front of the temple's coat of arms and I faced him.

<blank>

Mr. Alphonse stepped in front of me, got down on one knee, and made eye contact with me.

<blank>

'Mr. Suzy, would you please take out your own tag and show it to me?'

<blank>

I pulled out the tag from my chest and held it out in front of Mr. Alphonse.

Mr. Alphonse holds it sotto voce and checks it.

Then he stood up as he was, and celebrated in high spirits.

<blank>

Now the infant has fulfilled his promise and returned safely to us! O Jenna! Bless this new compatriot with radiance!"

<blank>

When Mr. Alphonse's words of congratulation ended, the temple's coat of arms glowed faintly, and at the same time, I was enveloped in a pillar of light.

It fell on me softly like a hazy snowflake, and then quietly disappeared.

<blank>

This concludes the 'coming of age ceremony. Congratulations, Suzy."

<blank>

With a soft look in his eyes, Mr. Alphonse congratulated me.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Welcome back, Susie.

Welcome back...Susie."

<blank>

Howard Papa and Sonia Mama were all waiting for us in front of the Tsumesho!

<blank>

Howard Dad! Sonia Mom!"

<blank>

I threw out my luggage and jumped in with the two of them!

<blank>

Are you okay?" Suzy... Are you tired?"

<blank>

Sonia-mama asked me, gently patting my head as I clung to her.

<blank>

As I inhaled deeply while holding on to Mama Sonia, the nostalgic scent of Mama filled my chest.

When I was wrapped in Mom's scent, I was filled with a sense of security that I had come home. I wanted to bury my face deeper, so I put my hands around Mama Sonia's body.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Susie... are you feeling okay? Did you eat well?"

<blank>

Howard called out to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and gently pulled me into a hug.

He continues to reach out and cuddle with Howard Papa as well.

<blank>

I am sure that Howard remembers the first time he met me in the forest and is worried about me.

I know now that in Howard's eyes, I was a lost child who had not eaten enough and did not know where to go.

But it's okay, okay? Howard Papa.

I am no longer the same person I was then!

I could hunt and cook by myself, and I know I have a place to come home to!

<blank>

Howard Papa's large hands give a sense of calm and security, like the scent of Darjeeling.

The warmth of his hands seemed to tell me once again that this is a good place to come back to.

<blank>

Yes, I'm fine! I am fine, I am not tired! I have eaten well! I have some souvenirs for you, okay?

<blank>

I looked up with Howard Papa and Sonia Mama clinging to me and gave them back their answers to their questions.

<blank>

As I looked up at the two of them standing close together, holding each other with both hands and looking up from below, my face naturally broke out in tears.

The two men who saw this also narrowed their eyes and gave me a kind look in return.

I am so happy about it that my hands clinging to the two of them become even more powerful.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I was so immersed in the pleasant moment with the two of them that I realized too late... Mia and Bibi had also come to pick me up.

Irving and Lombardo, who were already the same age and had completed their ordeal, were also there.

And then there's Willie and Colin, who are one step above me on the 9th level...plus Dana, who is here today.

Everyone congratulated me individually.

<blank>

"Next month, when Bibi's ordeal is over, we will all be members of the Protectorate!"

<blank>

Irving said this happily.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

I was to return home with Sonia-mama.

Howard Papa will receive a report on the "ordeal" from "Team Aria" at the meeting room, and then he has a meeting with the patriarchs of Amkam, so he will be back in the evening.

<blank>

The carriage to the house was steered by Sonia-mama.

I told her I would do it, but she wouldn't let me take the reins and told me to rest quietly next to her.

<blank>

Along the way, we talked about the events during the "ordeal" as we went along.

<blank>

The building of an encampment on high ground. We hunted and processed horned rabbits for a meal. We were lucky to find rock salt. The spices we brought with us improved the quality of our cooking... And the sandwiches we had for lunch were very, very tasty... I just went on and on with my thoughts.

<blank>

Mom was smiling the whole time, and occasionally she would say, "Oh, really?　That's wonderful!　She was happy to hear my story.

<blank>

<blank>

The walk home was already a familiar scene for me.

<blank>

Hodgson's pond in the spring reflected the thicket in a turquoise glow.

The waves created by the waterfowl moving on the surface of the water shimmer in the thicket.

<blank>

The poplars along the tree-lined avenue in Kuroki were still leafless in March, but they were reaching skyward to show off their powerful branches.

<blank>

In March, the wheat fields were still just sprouting and most of the fields were showing the color of the earth.

But the view, with its earthy colors and young green stripes undulating like waves over the hills and going on forever, is still fragrant with the scent of spring.

<blank>

<blank>

This road and landscape is one I first saw last summer when Howard Papa took me there.

The season is different now, and the scenery I see is different from then, but I know that it has become a landscape that makes me feel nostalgic.

<blank>

Even though I was gone for only a week, I can't help but miss this road, that field, those trees, and everything else....

This is where I feel like I've come home.

<blank>

Just before we were about to arrive home, as the carriage was going up the hillside in front of the house, Sonia-mama reminded us....

<blank>

I'm sure you'll get along great with her! I'm sure you'll get along great!"

<blank>

He said so with a big smile on his face.

Hmm? Who is it? Do you have a customer?

<blank>

As we entered the premises, Gilberto arrived as if he had been waiting for us.

<blank>

"Thank you for your hard work, young lady. Congratulations!

<blank>

congratulated me and helped me unload the cargo from the back of the truck.

<blank>

Thank you, Mr. Gilbert! I have returned without incident.

<blank>

Gilberto's response to my question was, "As expected of a young lady! Mm! That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about!　She was smiling and nodding her head again and again, as if happy.

<blank>

I asked Gilberto to take my luggage and proceeded to the entrance, where Elrose was waiting for me.

Elrose also congratulated me and thanked me for my labor, and as I thanked him, I noticed another person standing behind him.

<blank>

Elrose-san noticed my eye contact and his smile deepened, and he pushed the person forward with a thud.

<blank>

That person in the maid's uniform who came forward, have we met somewhere? I think I've seen her before...

<blank>

She is shorter than Elrose and Sonia-mama. But she is the older sister who looks up to me a little.

Her shiny, beautiful dark blonde hair is pulled back and a small headdress is placed on top of it.

He looked very intelligent with his thin eyebrows, slanted eyes, turquoise eyes, and the small finch glasses on his high nose.

<blank>

The maid outfit she is wearing is a long dress in a calming midnight blue. The large white cuffs that are folded back are a point of interest....

<blank>

The collar is not a feather, but an elegant, high standing collar that hides the throat.

The little white buttons were neatly lined up in order from there down.

<blank>

The white apron she wears is also long and reaches the hem of her skirt.

The frills on the shoulder pads are cute, but I feel that the lack of breast pads emphasizes the large chest armor!

<blank>

The ankles, glimpsed through the long length of the dress, can be seen to be covered by black stockings.

On their feet are round toe shoes with rounded tips that are black and strap fastened.

<blank>

The maid lady stepped forward and introduced herself with a polite bow.

<blank>

I'm AnnaMarie Bairos and I've been asked to take care of your daughter. My name is Annemarie Bairos, and I have been asked to take care of your daughter.

<blank>

When he said that, he sent me a smile that looked like it was going to be a prodigal smile.



<blank>

----------------

I'll give you my best advice for Bibi, who's about to make her final preparations the month after next! I'll give you my best advice for Bibi, who's coming up last month!"

Eh?" Oh, thank you! Irving...!"

Listen, first of all, when you sleep in a tree cave on a rainy day, you have to be careful, because water will come in. You also have to make sure you know where the tree you're standing in is."

"I...what? I'll pitch my tent, so in a tree cave..."

I'm sleeping in a tree!"

What?" Dana's a tree-hugger?"

I know," he said! If you wear a cape and tie yourself to the trunk on a branch, you won't fall off, you won't get flooded, and most importantly, it's easier to find your prey!"

'Sure, but Bibi's a girl! But Bibi's a girl, so I think she should pick a place where she can guard her perimeter."

Oh, thanks...Irving...but, Ten..."

That's why we're up in the tree, isn't it?" Irving! You can't get attacked in a tree!

"Still, Bibi's a rear-guard girl. ......

...... Bibi, don't take anything these two say seriously, okay?"

I know...I know...I know...it's okay...I know...I know...I know...I know." Colin ....... I know! I know!"
