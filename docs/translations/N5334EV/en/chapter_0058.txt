# Episode 53 The End of Suzy Cloud's Ritual

That day, I woke up with the sunrise, had a simple breakfast, and then tidied up the campsite.

<b>

I folded the tent and packed the dishes and tools I had brought into my backpack.

I also made sure not to forget the meat of the horned rabbit and the crawler's thread.

In the end, I had a total of three spools of thread!

Did I manage to squeeze it all out nicely until the end? Hehe♪

<b>

After gathering my belongings, it was time to clean up this place that had been my campsite.

I broke down the stove and filled in the holes I had dug.

The grass and plants I had cut wouldn’t grow back immediately, but within a month, they would return to their original bushy state.

<b>

That’s the Amukamu Forest.

If you dawdle, it will quickly encroach upon human habitation… this is truly a forest of magic.

<b>

Leaving no trace of this campsite is not for the sake of nature conservation, but for the sake of the children who will face trials later.

In other words, it means to show your strength without taking advantage of the paths left by predecessors!

It’s truly heavy, just like the village of Amukamu!

<b>

Once I finished tidying up the campsite, I headed down to return to the station.

<b>

I stopped for a moment at the area within the safe zone where the stakes were lined up, where I had parted ways with Aria and the others on the first day.

After a while, Aria and the others arrived.

<b>

Upon confirming my presence, Aria flashed a handsome smile at me.

I returned the smile, and Ms. Keti raised her arm and cast a spell.

The magic shot into the sky, producing a series of light popping sounds.

It reminded me of the sounds of a sports day.

<b>

This is said to be a signal indicating the end of the trial.

After looking up at the firework-like signal, I began walking towards the station again.

Aria and the others followed behind me.

<b>

Eventually, when we reached the north plaza of the station, Mr. Alphonse welcomed us in front of the station, just like when he saw us off with several members.

<b>

“Welcome back, Suzy.”

“Suzy Cloud, I have returned!”

<b>

In response to the welcoming words, I replied with “I have returned,” and Mr. Alphonse nodded with a smile.

He then led me inside the station, and we arrived at a small meeting room displaying the emblem of the temple, just like before my departure.

<b>

Just like a week ago, Mr. Alphonse stood in front of the temple's emblem, and I faced him.

<b>

Mr. Alphonse stepped forward, knelt down, and met my gaze.

<b>

“Suzy, could you please take out your tag and show it to me?”

<b>

I followed his instructions and pulled out the tag from my chest, presenting it to Mr. Alphonse.

He gently took it and confirmed it.

Then he stood up and raised his voice in a grand proclamation.

<b>

“Now, the child has fulfilled the covenant and has safely returned to us! Oh, Yienna! Grant this new comrade a radiant blessing!”

<b>

As Mr. Alphonse's proclamation ended, the temple's emblem emitted a soft light, and at the same time, I was enveloped in a pillar of light.

It fell upon me like hazy snow, softly showering me, and eventually faded away quietly.

<b>

“With this, the ‘Rite of Passage’ is complete. Congratulations, Suzy.”

<b>

With a gentle gaze, Mr. Alphonse offered me his words of congratulations.

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Welcome back, Suzy.”

“Welcome back… Suzy.”

<b>

In front of the station, Papa Howard and Mama Sonia were waiting together!

<b>

“Papa Howard! Mama Sonia!!”

<b>

I dropped my luggage and jumped into their arms!

<b>

“Are you okay? Suzy… Are you tired?”

<b>

While gently stroking my head, Mama Sonia asked me.

<b>

Taking a deep breath while hugging Mama Sonia, the familiar scent of her filled my chest.

Wrapped in Mama's scent, I was filled with a sense of relief that I had come home. I wanted to bury my face deeper, and my hands around Mama Sonia tightened.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Suzy… were you feeling lonely? Did you eat properly?”

<b>

Papa Howard spoke to me with concern, placing his hand on my shoulder and gently pulling me closer.

I reached out to Papa Howard as well and clung tightly to him.

<b>

I’m sure Papa Howard is remembering the first time we met in the forest and is worried about me.

Now I understand… from Papa Howard's perspective, I must have been a lost child who couldn’t even eat properly and didn’t know where to go back then…

But it’s okay, Papa Howard.

I’m not the same as I was back then!

I can hunt and cook by myself now, and I know that I have a place to return to!!

<b>

Papa Howard's large hand provided a sense of calm and reassurance, like being enveloped in the scent of Darjeeling.

It was as if that warmth was teaching me again that this is a place I can come back to.

<b>

“Yes! I’m fine, I’m not tired! I ate properly! I even have souvenirs!”

<b>

Still clinging to Papa Howard and Mama Sonia, I looked up and answered their questions.

<b>

As I looked up at the two of them standing close together, I couldn’t help but smile.

Seeing that, both of them narrowed their eyes and returned my gentle gaze.

That made me happy, and I tightened my grip on them even more.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I was so immersed in the pleasant moment with them that I didn’t realize until later that Mia and Vivi had also come to welcome me.

Irvin and Lombard, who were the same age and had completed their trials, were there too.

Also, there were Willie and Colin, who were one rank above, and today, Dana was also present.

Everyone offered me their congratulations.

<b>

“When Vivi finishes her trial next month, we’ll all be members of the Civil Guard!”

<b>

Irvin said happily.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

I ended up going home with Mama Sonia.

Papa Howard would be receiving reports about the “Team Aria” from the station and then attending a meeting with the heads of Amukamu, so he would be home in the evening.

<b>

Mama Sonia drove the carriage home.

I offered to do it, but she insisted, “Suzy, just sit quietly beside me,” and wouldn’t let me take the reins.

<b>

On the way, we talked about various things that happened during the “trial.”

<b>

I mentioned how I set up the campsite on a high ground, how I hunted and prepared the horned rabbit for a meal, how lucky I was to find rock salt, and how the spices I brought improved the quality of the food… and how the sandwiches in my lunch were incredibly, incredibly delicious, just rambling on without any particular order.

<b>

Mama smiled the whole time, occasionally interjecting with “Is that so? I’m glad to hear that! That sounds wonderful!” and listened to me happily.

<b>

<b>

The way home was already a familiar sight to me.

<b>

The pond in Hodisun was shimmering turquoise, reflecting the thicket.

The waves created by waterfowl gliding across the surface rippled through the thicket.

<b>

The poplars lining the road were still bare in March, but they stretched their strong branches toward the sky.

<b>

The wheat fields in March had just sprouted, and most of the field showed the color of the earth.

However, the stripes of that earthy color and the young green rolled over the hills like waves, continuing endlessly, still carrying the scent of spring.

<b>

<b>

This road and scenery were the first I saw last summer when Papa Howard took me there.

Now, although the season is different and the scenes I see are different, I can tell that it has already become a nostalgic sight for me.

<b>

Even though I had only been away for a week, this road, that field, and those trees all felt unbearably nostalgic…

There is a place here that I can truly call home.

<b>

Eventually, just before we arrived home, as the carriage climbed the hill in front of our house, Mama Sonia suddenly remembered…

<b>

“Oh, by the way, when we get home, there’s someone I need to introduce you to! I think you’ll get along well!”

<b>

She said with a beaming smile.

Hmm? Who could it be? Is there a guest?

<b>

As we entered the premises, Mr. Gilberto came out as if he had been waiting.

<b>

“Miss, thank you for your hard work. Congratulations on your return!”

<b>

He offered his congratulations and helped me unload my luggage from the cart.

<b>

“Thank you, Mr. Gilberto! I returned without any incidents.”

<b>

In response to my answer, Mr. Gilberto repeatedly exclaimed, “As expected of the young lady! Yes! Just as expected!” and nodded happily as usual.

<b>

With Mr. Gilberto carrying my luggage, I moved toward the entrance, where Ms. Elrose was waiting for me.

Ms. Elrose also offered her congratulations and words of encouragement, and as I thanked her, I noticed someone else standing behind her.

<b>

Noticing my gaze, Ms. Elrose smiled wider and gently pushed that person forward.

<b>

The person who stepped forward in a maid outfit seemed familiar, as if I had seen her somewhere before…

<b>

She was shorter than Ms. Elrose and Mama Sonia, but I had to look up slightly at this older sister.

She had beautiful dark blonde hair tied back, with a small headpiece on top.

Her thin eyebrows and elongated eyes, sparkling turquoise eyes, and small finch glasses perched on her high nose made her look very intelligent.

<b>

The maid outfit she wore was a calm midnight blue long dress. The large white cuffs that were turned back seemed to be a point of interest.

<b>

The collar was not a flap but an elegant high standing collar that concealed her throat.

Small white buttons were neatly lined down from there.

<b>

The white apron she wore was also long, reaching the hem of her skirt.

The frills on the shoulder pads were cute, but since there was no chest piece, it seemed to emphasize her larger chest armor, which I guess is just because she’s an older sister?!

<b>

From the long dress, I could see her ankles peeking out, covered in black stockings.

On her feet were round-toed shoes, black with straps.

<b>

The maid stepped forward and introduced herself with a polite bow.

<b>

“Nice to meet you, Miss Suzy. I am Anna Marie Byros, and I have been entrusted with taking care of you.”

<b>

Saying that, she sent me a smile that seemed to melt.

<b>

----------------

“Alright! Next month, for Vivi, who has the last trial ahead, I’ll give you some special advice!”

“Eh?! Oh, thank you! Irvin…!”

“Listen, first, when you sleep in a tree hollow on a rainy day, you have to be careful or water will come in. You also need to check the position of the standing trees.”

“...Eh? I’ll be putting up a tent, so I won’t be in a tree hollow…”

“I sleep in the trees!”

“Oh? Dana is a tree sleeper?”

“That's right! If I wear a cloak and tie myself to the trunk on a branch, I won’t fall, and even if it floods, I’ll be fine, and most importantly, it’s easier to spot prey!”

“That’s true! But since Vivi is a girl, I think she should choose a place where she can guard her surroundings.”

“Ah, thank you… Irvin… but, tents…”

“That’s why it’s better to be in the trees, right? Irvin! If you’re in the trees, you won’t be suddenly attacked!”

“Even so, Vivi is a rear guard girl…”

“...Vivi, don’t take what these two say too seriously, okay?”

“I understand… I get it, so I’m fine! Colin… Yes! I understand!”

Next time, “The Amukamu Council”
