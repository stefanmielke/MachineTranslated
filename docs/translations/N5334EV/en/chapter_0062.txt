# 57 - The Envoy of Meridies

Thank you for your patience.

Starting today, I will be dropping daily for five consecutive days.

<blank>

Please keep in touch with us<(_ _)>.


----------------

<blank>

For our first lunch at the school in a week, we decided to have it at the gazebo on the west side of the training hall.

This was made from surplus materials from last year's restoration of the training center.

<blank>

It is a typical hexagonal gazebo about 6 meters long with a large table and bench in the center. There is room for seven to eight people to sit comfortably.

Including the benches on the surrounding walls, it is large enough to fit all the girls in the school.

<blank>

<blank>

But today it's just the kids on the higher floors.

<blank>

Colin, Dana, Mia, Bibi, and myself. And Mary and Helena, the seven of us.

It could be said that they are the usual men and women.

<blank>

<blank>

And somehow I was placed on Mia's lap.

It is a surreal (?) situation, eating on Mia's lap, with her back wrapped in the corrupt sofa. It is a surreal state of affairs.

<blank>

For some reason, Mia has been strangely reluctant to leave me since this morning.

What's going on?

'Danger is dangerous ......,' he says, and he's still holding it and cunking my head .......

It's a little embarrassing, so I'd appreciate it if you could hold off a little longer. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'So, Sue, did you level the high ground?'

She said, "It's amazing! Sister Suzy!"

As expected of Sis Sue!

<blank>

Mia is surprised when I tell her the story of how we built the encampment, and Helena and Mary, who are on either side of her, make a big fuss about how great it is.

<blank>

Helena, Mary, I think you know this, but normal people can't do this, okay?"

<blank>

Colin said something like I was not a normal person and admonished them for being so flirtatious.

Isn't that kind of rude?

<blank>

What? You cut a rock out of a rock block and made a table? Roughly! No one can make a table out of a block of rock big enough to make a table out of! No one can make a table out of a block of rock! And to cut it? What kind of a master are you?

<blank>

Even Bibi shot a series of words at me as if to say that I was insane.

<blank>

"You know what? I can't be of any use to you, can I?"

<blank>

Colin further nails Helena and Mary.

<blank>

Odd, I feel like the more I talk about it during the ordeal, the more I feel the air of dismay from everyone. ......

To top it all off, Bibi even labeled me a "brainiac" like Dana and Irving!

I can't figure it out!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

****************************************

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"So? What have you heard?

<blank>

While we were having after-dinner tea, Bibi asked me slowly.

<blank>

I only heard ...... that the pioneers arrived early this morning.

<blank>

Perhaps they are concerned about what the Knights are up to.

Unfortunately, I only know that Howard's father received word from the Amcam House early this morning.

<blank>

He said, "Well, ...... that's right! That just happened this morning!"

<blank>

Bibi exhaled to relax.

<blank>

And Father." I headed to the Amcam House early in the morning and ......! Looks like things are going to get kind of hectic!"

My dad also took my mom to Wando Village yesterday,...... and he said he won't be back for a month."

He hasn't been back for three months. My brother Pern has been gone for six months.

Really, ......, now is the time when none of the patriarchs of Group 12 are available. ......

It means there's a serious overflow! There's a manpower shortage everywhere!"

But Dad said there are enough teams in the 10th that we don't have to worry about the Knights, okay?"

I can't sit still! I can't sit still! Hey! The weekend after tomorrow! We're all going hunting the weekend after tomorrow!

<blank>

Everyone firmly understands that Amcam is in a tough spot right now.

Dana probably knows this, but I guess her body tries to move first.

<blank>

The children's application! It won't be approved in a day or two! Especially at a dangerous time when there's an overflow!"

Well, I don't think they'll accept your application, and since you can't leave the safe zone, there's no way you can fight the 'overflow' from the start.

I know...at least as strong as Sue."

I'm sure you're right. If we run into a bunch of red pongos or something, there's nothing we can do about it!"

I knew it, my sister is amazing!"

Ah! Sister Sue! Teach me how to throw a knife next time!"

<blank>

With Dana's shoulders slumped, Helena clapped her hands on her own chest, her loose wavy strawberry blonde hair, which looked pink in the right light, shook, and her innocent eyes gleamed a macallight green as she happily complimented me on my deed!

What? That innocent sparkle in your eyes?

Dazzling! It's dazzling, Helena!

<blank>

Mary, with her soft platinum blonde hair, which had a medium cut just like her brother Victor's, was beguiling me with a twinkle in her eye!

<blank>

I'm not going to do it!

Dazzle! It's dazzling!

Because the sparkle in those honest eyes is very, very dazzling! Ya-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma! Both of you!

<blank>

What? What? Mary ......na want to learn to throw knives?"

Un! That knife technique that crushes enemies at a distance with a single blow! I want to learn that for sure!"

Oh! Cheating Mary! I wish I could tell you how much I wish I could tell you, too! Oh, Sister Suzy!!!"

Huh?" Oh, uh, yeah. ...... yeah, right."

<blank>

I'm not sure if there is a way to do that with a spear," he said! Is there a technique with a spear where you can send something flying off the tip of the sword and hit the enemy like Sue is doing?"

What, uh, is there a ......?"

<blank>

I'm pretty sure the 'impact-based' skills could be used for anything other than knives and wands. ......

But I'm in trouble ......, everyone sees me use the "impact system", even though I was a bit out of it, was I too much of a jerk?

Well, it's too late to say that now!

I can teach them, but whether they can use it is another story.

<blank>

Really? Oh, yeah! I'm going to have to learn how to shoot!"

But that can only be done if the weapon is properly filled with sword ki. ...... So Dana, you should practice stable Ki first, okay?"

I see, that's it. So, that's the one where you swing your spear and reap the enemies around you! That doesn't work so well either. I can't seem to get that one to work either.

<blank>

I wonder if you are talking about Wind Blow. Dana, you wield it with so much force that you don't have the awareness to release your "Ki".

<blank>

You can't do that unless you have a firm grasp of swordsmanship, okay?

I guess it's as difficult to handle as magic power.

But unlike with magic, Dana has already grasped Ki, so all she has to do is train and get used to it, okay?"

<blank>

Sure! Good! Then you'll have to keep me company today, Sue!"

Oh! That's not fair, sister Dana! I'm learning to throw knives too!"

Yes, Dana, that's not fair! We were here first!"

<blank>

What? Oh, oh, well, that's sorry."

Okay, then we'll do it together. I'll watch the three of you and give you some advice, okay?"

I'll see you later! Well then! I guess we'll all be training in the training hall this afternoon!"

<blank>

Dana has made plans for the afternoon.

<blank>

'Well, let's have Colin and the others play Koch today, anyway!'

What? Us too?"

I haven't been there for a while! I haven't been to the Soc. for a while and ......! I have to go every once in a while or I'll get slow! I want to be fit for the trials now!"

I'll go if you go!"

Well, I guess I'll have to ask you to join me in a stand-up fight for the first time in a while."

<blank>

In the end, all the girls ended up training in the training hall that afternoon.

After all, it seems that everyone can't sit still.

<blank>

In case you are wondering - the kids in the magic group also do physical training on a regular basis.

The common sense that those who use magic do not use their bodies does not exist here in Amkam!

<blank>

For those who primarily use magic, increasing magical power is of paramount importance.

In order to increase the magical power, we need to work on our mental power.

The surest and quickest way to train the mind is to train the body!

<blank>

In Amkam, people in the magic profession do not neglect to train their bodies, based on the brainy idea that "the body is the most important part of the body," and that "the body is the most important part of the body.

Well, according to Dr. Henry, this is the "Amcam-specific" way, right? ......

<blank>

Still, it is said that the magic value of people from Amkam is generally high, so they are not wrong. But, after all, the idea of this area is quintessential Amkam! I wonder if it is ......?

<blank>

This is why Bibi and his friends are so strong that even with their bare hands, they are no match for the average ragamuffin.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

****************************************

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After we all worked up a good sweat like that, we left school a little earlier than usual.

They all want to go home early and find out what's going on with the Knights.

<blank>

But for some reason, when I left school, Mia grabbed me and took me straight to her home, the Matisons' house.

Mia says it's to replenish the "Sue-chan component" for the week. ......

<blank>

I can't tell you how ...... they were replenished, but I can tell you .......

Yes! I can't tell you that!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I came home from the Matthieson house, AnnaMarie was waiting for me in front of the house again today.

<blank>

"Um, ......, maybe you've been waiting outside the whole time?"

It is my duty to serve you, my lady.

<blank>

When I asked him about it, he told me that he had been waiting outside until I left.

Did I make you wait here for too long by any chance?

<blank>

Oh, um, sorry ...... for being so late."

No, sir. Waiting is part of serving.

<blank>

AnnaMarie's eyes, smiling as she said this, were a little scary for some reason.

<blank>

<blank>

That night, I went to ...... for a massage, which was supposed to be the next one in two weeks.

<blank>

Might as well get things a little more in order while we're at it."

<blank>

AnnaMarie urged me to do it, and I did.

<blank>

The extent of that treatment surpassed yesterday's, and I think ...... I couldn't keep my voice down.

Why 'I think' is ...... because I haven't been clear about my consciousness since the middle of the ......!

<blank>

I have a feeling that they did some pretty amazing things to some pretty tough places, but I'm not sure!

Oh, I'm going to be a tattle-tale! I'm getting so tart!

<blank>

This is really great, isn't it?

I can't tell you what's not good enough!

<blank>

......I don't think I've heard this kind of voice many times in one day. ......

<blank>

And ...... anyway! I fell into a deep sleep and woke up the next morning without even dreaming!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I came back from my run that morning, I found Papa Howard training his sword in the courtyard.

<blank>

Papa had returned quietly late last night when I was sleeping without dreaming, he said.

<blank>

After I sweat myself off, I grab a towel as usual and watch Howard work out.

<blank>

Howard Papa's swordsmanship is still cool.

Each movement is as supple and powerful as flowing water.

I've been seeing them every day for almost a year now, so I've memorized the patterns.

<blank>

Pull there, then step forward. The center of gravity is dropped forward so that it flows from just below the shinbone, and the sword is thrust in as it is. Inhale as you rotate the sword on your shoulder, and exhale as you shoot down in front of the opponent.

<blank>

I've already learned when to breathe, so I go along with my dad and breathe along with him.

<blank>

But I don't know why. ...... Today's dad is a little different from usual.

<blank>

He usually has a calm and composed appearance, but today his composure is even deeper than usual.

The aspect of the sword that Papa wields is deeper and heavier than ever.

<blank>

That heavy calmness makes something tingle inside me.

A small thumping sounded deep in my chest.

<blank>

I carry the towel to the place where Howard had finished his workout, as usual.

Then, after opening a breath, I boldly asked.

<blank>

Um, Howard, Dad. Was there anything ......, sir?"

<blank>

When I said this, Howard's hand, which was wiping his face with the towel he had received, stopped for a moment.

<blank>

What is it? What is it? Did you feel something in my sword?

"Yes, I felt that the sword line was more massive ...... than usual. It was as if ...... you were setting your mind on something, anything, ...... and I got that feeling."

<blank>

Upon hearing this, Howard's eyes widened for a moment, but then he immediately narrowed them and smiled happily.

<blank>

I see. ...... I see. The swordsmanship is something that can never be faked.

<blank>

Then he becomes caracara and funny.

<blank>

I wonder how easily Susie's eyes can catch the state of my heart! Ha ha ha ha! This is a return to yesterday's point, isn't it?"

What? No, no! That's not what ......!"

<blank>

Before I could continue, Howard's hand gently caressed my head.

<blank>

Thank you Susie, you're worried about me, aren't you? But ...... I'm fine, there's nothing to worry about."

<blank>

He then yanked down the hand he had placed on my head and cupped his hand around my cheek.

<blank>

It's true that AmCam is going through a difficult time," he said. But AmCam is not so soft that it can't handle something like this, okay?"

"...... Yes."

'Hmmm ......, yes. Yesterday I told you not to go out too much. ....... If we don't have enough help, could you lend us a hand?"

Ha, hi! Of course! If there's anything I can do to help, I'll do it!

<blank>

When I gave him my answer, he put his hand on my cheek and smiled happily.

<blank>

Well, that's a relief to hear. Please take care of the ...... village, Suzy. Protect them all. ......"

"...... yes, I'll take care of it. ...... please.

I promise. ...... please."

<blank>

I put my own small hand on top of the big, hard hand on my cheek, and nodded yukily as I looked into Papa Howard's eyes.

<blank>

Still, the small melancholy that was born deep in my heart never disappeared, and continued to smolder forever.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After breakfast, Papa Howard went straight to the Amcam House.

He said he would not return until the Knights arrived.

<blank>

Sonia-mama said she would be there before noon, so after lunch at the school, I decided to go straight to the Amcome House.

<blank>

When I told him about it when we got to the school, he said that Bibi and Mia were going with us.

<blank>

Bibi wants to go see his father, who has not yet returned home, and Mia says she is ...... my chaperone.

<blank>

After the morning's classroom lecture, I said no to the teacher, hurriedly finished my meal, and headed to the Amcam House.

The Amcome House is about a kilometer west of the school. It is a little off to the south from our way home.

<blank>

The Amcam House was right in the middle of the hustle and bustle when we arrived.

<blank>

Many large wagons came and went, blocking the road, attached to the buildings, waiting their turn to unload.

The person to whom the unloaded load is stacked, and who classifies the load, and who carries the classified load.

A person opens a package, checks its contents, and takes out the materials. Craftsmen begin to work with the materials.

<blank>

It was as if the area around the Amcam House had suddenly become a noisy construction site.

<blank>

Nah! What is this? This!

<blank>

Bibi is yelling at me, covering his ears with the palms of his hands.

<blank>

Quite right, this is a messy hustle and bustle that bears no resemblance to the long, quiet Amkam.

<blank>

<blank>

"Princess? Isn't that Princess Suzy of Amcam?

<blank>

A beautiful voice, which passed well in such a bustling place, came from behind, throwing words that made me blush.

<blank>

What? Nah! What?

<blank>

The people around me who are working are all looking at me!

I turned around, feeling my face heat up, and there she was, a lovely older sister.

<blank>

The person who came running toward us with a big smile on her face was Raisa, one of the knights who visited our house the other day.

<blank>

I knew it was Princess Susie! I'm so happy to see you again! We meet again!

What? ...... la, raisa, mr.?"

Yes, I am Raisa Ulunova, Your Highness! You remembered me! Thank you!

<blank>

I introduced Ms. Raisa to Bibi and Mia, who were looking quizzically at me with their hands over their ears, trying to keep the noise down.

I'm just saying hello, but I'm not sure if you're not aware that I've been called a "princess"!

<blank>

Sorry for the noise. ......

<blank>

Raisa-san put her hands behind her head and showed me an apologetic smirk as she looked around.

<blank>

We're going to have to do a rush job to get it done in time.

<blank>

I knew it was a construction site.

<blank>

Raisa-san told us that they are preparing temporary accommodations for the main body of the Knights and their support personnel who will come later.

<blank>

I'm so tired of it! Our envoys are too much like servants! He had to return all the way to Amkam without a day off! I thought I'd be able to rest once I got to Amkam, but my unit commander told me to supervise the construction of the dormitory! Ahh..! I'm sure I'll die of exhaustion without a boyfriend!

That's ......, that's a big deal. ......

<blank>

It seems that they have come to know the black working environment of the knighthood without realizing it.

Both Bibi and Mia look at Raisa with sympathy as she gazes up at the heavens and laments.

<blank>

Oh! I am sorry to keep you here! You came to see your father ......, didn't you, Your Highness?"

<blank>

Raisa clapped her hands as if she had just noticed.

When I told him that was the case, he told me that Howard and his family had left the office a little while ago to have a late lunch, so they should be in the Great Hall by now.

<blank>

Oh, I have to go back! If I don't go back now, I'll get a big kick in the butt from Captain Magritte......! Princess! I hope to see you again!

<blank>

After he told me, Mr. Raisa ran off in a great hurry, shouting that he was in a hurry. He was surprisingly hectic. ......

Bibi and Mia both look at me like I'm a dunce and I'm looking away.

<blank>

And so we made our way through the hustle and bustle to the hall where Howard's father and his family were staying.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The distance from De Kembel to Copetown is approximately 300 kilometers, connected by a paved and well-maintained road.

The path was sturdy, paved with 50-cm tortoise-shell shaped basalt.

The road is more than 5 meters wide and can easily be passed by horse-drawn carriages.

It straddles the center of this continent and is one of the arteries of the country connecting end to end.

<blank>

On that street, a group of several dozen horsemen and several wagons were now heading north and making their way along the road.

<blank>

Those on horseback carried backpacks, armored limbs, and wore cyan-blue glowing magical beads on their chests.

It is clear that the group, with its occasional glimmer of light, is no ordinary brigade.

<blank>

Among them, an ebony chariot, larger than the others and conspicuously conspicuous, was being escorted by the surrounding horsemen, led by a dozen or so horsemen in a neat line.

<blank>

There was a horseman approaching the carriage with only one rider.

It runs alongside the carriage, removes its own hood and knocks lightly on the carriage window several times.

<blank>

The face that emerged from the hood was that of a man in his late thirties with stern, piercing eyes.

His short black hair was brushed back and his mustache was tied tightly around his mouth. The scars on his cheeks showed that he was a man who had seen many battles.

<blank>

After a brief pause, the carriage windows began to open sideways with a yuk.

The man peeks out of the ornately decorated window and looks at those on horseback with an irreverent expression on his face.

<blank>

In the window, I saw a man with his face peeking out, holding a glass of champagne in his hand.

Further back, a woman can be seen holding a bottle of champagne poured into a glass.

We cannot see their faces, but we can see that they are wearing dresses with wide open bosoms. Perhaps they are people who make their living by drinking and conversing with others.

<blank>

However, the person on horseback omitted such a presence from his view and spoke to the owner of the carriage whose face peeked out.

<blank>

Representative Houllier. We are on schedule to arrive in Copetown on the 25th of the second month.

"Hmmm... ......, I wonder? "Hmmm...I wonder if seven days from Dekenbel to Amkam is a little too long a journey..."

<blank>

When the man on the horse announced that his travel schedule was not in order, the man in the carriage, called Fourier, let out a sigh of frustration from his large, distinctive nose and expressed his dissatisfaction with the schedule.

<blank>

The distance that would normally take more than 10 days to travel is being done with a minimum of rations. I am sure you understand that this is quite an arduous march.

"Mmm... but you know what? Do you know how long it has been since we left Meridies? It's already been two months! And we haven't even arrived there yet! What a disappointment! Can't you see that the people want results as soon as possible?

With all due respect, it's only been two months. Isn't it a great achievement to have brought this unit to this point in just two months?"

<blank>

The man on horseback explains the forcible nature of the itinerary and that he is fully ripe for it, but the one called Fourier still seems to be unconvinced.

Then, from the back of the carriage, a man with nervous eyes came to speak irritatingly to the man on horseback.

<blank>

Captain Meyer! Even though you are a knighthood, aren't you being too opinionated about your representative? You are the representative of this delegation!

...... Hmm, no problem, Mr. Clark. More importantly, was it Copetown? Is everything all right? It is a small rural town with a population of 2,000 at the most, isn't it? Is it possible to procure materials satisfactorily? Shouldn't you have gone to Dekenberger?"

<blank>

The man, with his sallow face contorted, gave the man on horseback a bitter look, to which Houllier admonished him and threw further complaints at the man on horseback, whom he called Meyer.

<blank>

Coppertown is the northernmost and last commercial center in our country, but it still sees more than 10,000 visitors a day. It is not a small place. I am sure it was the decision of the representative of the mission to hurry ahead and reduce the number of cargoes to avoid losing any more visitors.

I said, "...... hmmm. Is that right? So there's no problem getting materials locally then?"

Magritte, who preceded us, has already made contact with Amcam. She is now preparing to receive us."

'Hmmm, pigeon tidings. ....... Very well, I leave it to you. Cedric Meyer, commander of the 12th Motorized Heavy Knights, 1,000 men. Please hurry.

"At your service, Cameron Houllier, head of the research mission."

<blank>

Waving his hand as if to say he has nothing more to say, Cameron Fourier closes the window of the carriage.

In the back of the room, the man called Clark continued to stare at Cedric Meyer until the end when the window was shut.

<blank>

You're still coming in here saying all sorts of self-indulgent things. ......

Don't say that, Kyle. "Don't say that, Kyle. Don't feel bad if you think you're blasting us like that?"

<blank>

As Cedric pulled away from the carriage, the man called Kyle pulled his horse over.

Kyle's soft blonde hair flutters in the breeze, and his brow furrows as he speaks.

<blank>

'Well, if the battalion commander says so, good.

In fact, it is he who has brought this unit to this point in such a short period of time.

The real work is being done by us and our guys over there who are making the neighborhood, though, right?"

<blank>

With that, Kyle looked at the carriage positioned in the rear and the figure on horseback moving ahead of it.

Unlike the luxurious carriage in which Fourier was riding earlier, the carriage is a minimally constructed covered wagon with seats strapped together to accommodate 10 or more people.

<blank>

In the covered wagon, many people had shadows under their eyes and were busy checking and producing documents. More than half of them were unconscious while being rocked by the wagon.

All are clerks who manage the funds and schedules of this mission.

Meanwhile, the person on horseback, who was their boss, was checking the documents presented to him from the carriage one after another. He was alone on the horse, so he could not lose consciousness. His shadows were more deeply etched than anyone else's.

<blank>

Kyle looked at him and sobered silently.

<blank>

But still, a delegate is a delegate."

"It's also representative of the fact that they demand detailed rest stops, you know? And it's common for innkeepers to stop for two or three days. ......"

It's necessary to keep up the energy. That's what this schedule is all about."

They are excellent people. Why don't you pull them out of our office?"

<blank>

Once again, Kyle looks at those behind him. Is it my imagination, or do the eyes of the person on the horse seem to be more bloodshot than before?

As their boss, he is not allowed to sleep on the move, as he is unable to ride in a carriage and must proceed on a single horse due to differentiation.

Kyle again lowered his eyes and slowly shook his head.

<blank>

'We have some excellent clerical people in our corps, you know? In any case, after all is said and done, ....... We have to get to Amkam first."

<blank>

Kyle responds, "Yes, that's right," and closes his mouth.

<blank>

It will take three more days to get to Amkam.

I hope the road trip was uneventful and those clerks didn't lose any more nerves and sleep. ......

Kyle Irvine thought about this as he advanced his horse alongside Cedric Meyer.
