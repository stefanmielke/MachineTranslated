# Chapter 57: The Envoy from Meridies

Thank you for your patience.

I will be posting every day for five consecutive days starting today.

<b>

I look forward to your continued support <(_ _)>

----------------

<b>

For the first lunch back at school after a week, I decided to have it at the gazebo on the west side of the training ground.

This was made from surplus materials that came from the restoration of the training ground last year.

<b>

It's a typical hexagonal gazebo about 6 meters in size, with a large table and benches set in the center. It has enough space for 7 to 8 people to sit comfortably.

If you include the benches placed around the walls, it could accommodate all the girls in the school.

<b>

<b>

But today, it's just the higher-tier children.

<b>

Colin, Dana, Mia, Vivi, me, and then Mary and Helena—seven of us.

It's the usual crowd.

<b>

<b>

And for some reason, I found myself sitting on Mia's lap.

Eating while being enveloped by the soft sofa of her body, it was quite a surreal (?) situation.

<b>

For some reason, Mia has been unusually reluctant to leave my side since this morning.

Did something happen?

She keeps saying things like, "Danger is dangerous..." and is still sniffing my head while holding me... 

It's a bit embarrassing, so I would appreciate it if she could tone it down a little...

<b>

<b>

<b>

"So, Su-chan, did you level the high ground?"

"That's amazing! Sister Suzy!"

"Sister Su, as expected!!"

<b>

When I talked about the time we built the campsite, Mia was surprised, and Helena and Mary on either side of her started making a fuss about how incredible it was.

<b>

"Helena, Mary, I think you understand, but normal people can't do that, okay?"

<b>

Colin was admonishing the two who were getting overly excited, as if I were not a normal person.

Isn't that a bit rude?

<b>

"What?! You cut the rocks you got from the rock block and made a table?! In the first place! No one can create a rock big enough to make a table!! Let alone cut it?! What kind of master are you?!"

<b>

Even Vivi chimed in, seemingly trying to imply that I was unreasonable.

<b>

"You understand, right? You can't use this as a reference, okay?"

<b>

Colin further reinforced this point to Helena and Mary.

<b>

It's strange; the more I talk about the trials, the more I feel a sense of disbelief from everyone...

In the end, Vivi even labeled me as one of the "muscle-headed friends" like Dana and Irvin!

I don't get it!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

****************************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"So? Are you listening to anything?!"

<b>

While we were having tea after lunch, Vivi suddenly asked.

<b>

"I only heard that the advance party arrived this morning... nothing else."

<b>

She was probably concerned about the movements of the knight order.

Unfortunately, all I knew was that Papa Howard had received a message from Amkam House early this morning.

<b>

"I see... that makes sense! It just happened this morning!"

<b>

Vivi let out a sigh as if relieved.

<b>

"My father also went to Amkam House early this morning...! It seems like things are going to get busy!"

"My dad took Mom to Wand Village yesterday... he said he wouldn't be back for a month."

"My dad hasn't been back for three months already. Brother Parn hasn't been back for six months."

"Right... now, none of the heads of the 12th group are around..."

"The 'overflow' is serious! Everywhere is short-handed!"

"But Papa said the 10th team has enough people, so we don't need to worry about the knight order, right?"

"Ah! I can't just sit still! Hey! How about we all go hunting together this weekend?!"

<b>

Everyone understands that Amkam is in a tough situation right now.

Dana probably understands too, but her body seems to want to move first.

<b>

"The children's applications! They won't be approved in a day or two! Especially not when there's a risk of 'overflow'!"

"Yeah, I don't think they'll accept applications, and we can't leave the safe zone, so it's impossible to counter the 'overflow' from the start."

"That's right, at least we need to be as strong as Su-chan!"

"Ugh... that's true. If we encounter a horde of Red Pongos, we wouldn't be able to do anything!"

"After all, Sister is amazing!"

"Ah! Sister Su! Please teach me how to throw knives next time!"

<b>

While I glanced at Dana, who was slumping her shoulders, Helena clapped her hands in front of her chest, her strawberry blonde hair with soft waves shimmering in the light, her innocent eyes sparkling with a macalite green as she praised my achievements!

What? What is that sparkle in her innocent eyes?!

It's dazzling! It's so dazzling, Helena!!

<b>

Then Mary, with her soft platinum blonde hair cut in a medium style resembling her brother Victor, came over with sparkling eyes, asking for something too!

<b>

Stop it!

It's dazzling! It's too dazzling!!

That honest sparkle in their eyes is just too, too dazzling! Stop it—both of you!!

<b>

"Huh? Huh? Mary... do you want to learn how to throw knives too?"

"Yes! I absolutely want to learn that knife technique that crushes enemies from a distance in one shot!"

"Ah! That's unfair, Mary! I want to learn too! Sister Suzy!!"

"Huh? Ah, um... yeah, okay..."

<b>

"Hey, Su! Is there a technique where you can shoot something from the tip of a spear like you do?"

"Huh, um... maybe?"

<b>

I thought I could use 'impact-type' skills with things other than knives or staves...

But I'm in trouble... everyone has seen me use 'impact-type' skills, even if I was a bit over the top at times.

Well, it's too late to say anything now!

I can teach them, but whether they can actually use it is another story.

<b>

"Really? Yay! Hehe, I have to practice hard to be able to shoot!"

"But that requires the weapon to properly contain 'sword energy'... So Dana should first practice handling stable 'energy', okay?"

"I see, that's definitely the point. So, um, is it that thing where you swing the spear around and sweep away the enemies? I can't quite do that yet..."

<b>

Maybe she's talking about 'Wind Blow'? Dana tends to swing it around with brute force, so she's probably not focusing on releasing 'energy'.

<b>

"You can't do that unless you have a solid grasp of 'sword energy', okay?"

"After all, it's 'sword energy'... it's just as difficult to handle as magical power."

"But unlike with magical power, Dana has already grasped 'energy', so I think it's just a matter of training and getting used to handling it, okay?"

<b>

"That's true! Alright! Then let's practice together today, Su!"

"Ah! That's unfair, Dana! I'm going to learn how to throw knives too!"

"That's right, Dana, that's unfair! We were here first!"

<b>

"Huh? Ah, um, sorry about that."

"That's fine, let's do it together. I'll watch the three of you and give advice, okay?"

"Alright! Then let's train at the training ground this afternoon!!"

<b>

Dana decided the plans for the afternoon.

<b>

"Since we're at it, let's have Colin and the others join us here too!"

"Huh? Us too?"

"Yeah! We haven't been over there for a while...! We need to go sometimes, or we'll get rusty! I also want to prepare my stamina for the trials starting now!"

"I'll go if Su-chan is going!"

"Yeah, then I guess I'll join you for a sparring session after a long time."

<b>

In the end, that afternoon turned into a training session for all the girls at the training ground.

No matter how you look at it, it seems everyone just can't sit still.

<b>

By the way, the magic group kids also regularly engage in physical training.

The common belief that those who use magic don't use their bodies doesn't exist here in Amkam!

<b>

For those who primarily use magic, raising their magical power is of utmost importance.

To raise magical power, one must strengthen their mental strength.

The most reliable and quickest way to train the mind is to train the body!

<b>

Based on this rather muscle-headed idea, people in Amkam do not neglect to train their bodies even if they are magic users.

Well, according to Mr. Henry, this seems to be a method unique to Amkam...

<b>

Even so, it seems that the magical power values of those from Amkam tend to be quite high, so it's not incorrect. But still, this kind of thinking is truly characteristic of Amkam!

<b>

For that reason, Vivi and the others possess strength that makes them no match for mere thugs with their bare hands.

<b>

<b>

<b>

****************************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After all that, we all had a pleasant time sweating and left school a bit earlier than usual.

Everyone seems eager to return home and find out about the knight order's movements.

<b>

But for some reason, as soon as I left school, I was abducted by Mia and taken straight to the Matisson household.

According to Mia, it was to replenish a week's worth of "Su-chan essence"...

<b>

...I can't say how that replenishment went...

Yes! I definitely can't say that!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I returned home from the Matisson household, Anna Mary was waiting for me in front of the house again.

<b>

"Um... did you wait outside the whole time?"

"My duty is to serve you, my lady."

<b>

When I asked, it turned out she had indeed been waiting outside until I returned.

Did I keep her waiting for quite a while?

<b>

"Ah, I'm sorry for being late..."

"No, waiting is part of my service."

<b>

As she said that, Anna Mary smiled, but for some reason, her eyes looked a bit scary.

<b>

<b>

That night, I was prompted by Anna Mary to have a massage that was supposed to be in two weeks...

<b>

"It might be better to get a little more prepared while we can."

<b>

As she encouraged me, I ended up having it done.

<b>

The treatment surpassed yesterday's, and I couldn't hold back my voice... I think.

The reason I say "I think" is that... I wasn't fully conscious from a certain point onward!

<b>

I felt like they did something quite intense, but I'm not sure!

Ah! I'm going to turn into a puddle!

<b>

This is seriously insane, you know?!

What exactly is insane, I can't quite say!

<b>

...I can't believe I made such sounds multiple times in one day... *cough cough!*

<b>

In any case! That night, I fell into a deep sleep without dreaming and woke up refreshed the next morning!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

That morning, when I returned from my run, I found Papa Howard training with a sword in the courtyard.

<b>

Papa had quietly returned late last night while I was sleeping without even dreaming.

<b>

After I washed off my sweat, I took a towel and went to watch Papa Howard's training as usual.

<b>

Papa Howard's swordsmanship is still so cool.

Each movement is as fluid and powerful as flowing water.

Having watched him almost every day for nearly a year, I've memorized the forms.

<b>

I draw back and then step in. I drop my center of gravity forward, flowing down from directly beneath my shinbone, and thrust. I inhale while rotating the sword over my shoulder and exhale as I strike down in front of me.

<b>

I've memorized the timing of the breaths, so I end up breathing in sync with Papa.

<b>

But for some reason... today, Papa seems a bit different than usual.

<b>

He usually has a calm and composed demeanor, but today, his calmness seems deeper than ever.

The way he wields his sword feels heavier and more profound than usual.

<b>

That heavy calmness stirs something within me.

My chest gave a small throb.

<b>

I approached Papa Howard as he finished his training, bringing him the towel as usual.

After a moment's pause, I mustered the courage to ask.

<b>

"Um, Papa Howard. Is something... wrong?"

<b>

When I said that, Papa Howard's hand, which had been wiping his face with the towel, paused for a moment.

<b>

"Something? ...Do you feel something in my sword?"

"Um... yes, it feels heavier than usual... as if... as if you have set your mind on something..."

<b>

Upon hearing that, Papa Howard's eyes widened for a moment, but then he quickly narrowed them and smiled happily.

<b>

"I see... I see. The way of the sword truly cannot be deceived."

<b>

He chuckled heartily.

<b>

"My state of mind can be so easily perceived by Suzy's eyes! Hahaha! This is a response to the intent from yesterday, isn't it?"

"Eh? N-no! That's not...!"

<b>

Before I could continue, Papa Howard gently patted my head.

<b>

"Thank you, Suzy. You're worried about me, aren't you? But... it's okay, there's nothing to worry about."

<b>

Saying that, Papa Howard slowly lowered his hand from my head and cupped my cheek with it.

<b>

"Indeed, Amkam is going through a tough time right now. However, Amkam is not so soft that it can be easily shaken by this level of difficulty."

"…Yes."

"Hmm... that's right. I told you not to wander around too much yesterday... But if it seems like we are short-handed, could I ask for your help?"

"Y-yes! Of course! If there's anything I can do, I'll help as much as I can!"

<b>

When I quickly replied, Papa Howard smiled happily while still holding my cheek.

<b>

"I’m relieved to hear that. Please take care of the village... take care of everyone..."

"…Yes, I will do my best..."

"That's a promise... I'm counting on you."

<b>

I placed my small hand on top of Papa Howard's large, firm hand resting on my cheek, looking into his eyes as I slowly nodded.

<b>

Yet still, the small worry that had formed deep within my chest did not disappear, continuing to flicker and smolder within me.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing breakfast, Papa Howard headed to Amkam House.

He said he wouldn't be back until the knight order arrives.

<b>

Since Sonia Mama would also be leaving around noon, I decided to have lunch at school and then head to Amkam House.

<b>

When I mentioned this after arriving at school, Vivi and Mia said they would go with me.

<b>

Vivi wanted to see her father, who hadn't returned home yet, and Mia... said she was my escort.

<b>

After the morning classes ended, I told the teacher I would be leaving and hurriedly finished my meal before heading to Amkam House.

Amkam House is located just over a kilometer west from the school. It feels like it veers slightly south from our usual route home.

<b>

When we arrived at Amkam House, it was in the midst of chaos.

<b>

Many large horse-drawn carriages were blocking the road, waiting to unload their cargo at the building.

The unloaded goods were being stacked, with some sorting the cargo and others transporting the sorted goods.

Some were opening the transported goods to check their contents and extract materials. And there were craftsmen starting their work using those materials.

<b>

The area around Amkam House suddenly resembled a noisy construction site.

<b>

"What on earth is this?!"

<b>

Vivi shouted while covering her ears with her palms.

<b>

Indeed, this chaotic noise is not fitting for the peaceful Amkam.

<b>

<b>

"Princess?! Is that Princess Suzy from Amkam?!"

<b>

Amidst the noise, a clear voice called out from behind, throwing a word that made me blush.

<b>

"Wha?! Wh-what are you talking about?!!"

<b>

Everyone working around turned to look at us?!

Feeling my face heat up, I turned around to find a cute older girl approaching with a round smile.

<b>

It was Lysa, one of the knights who visited our house the other day, coming towards us in a hurry.

<b>

"It really is Princess Suzy! I'm so glad to see you again!"

"Eh?! ...L-Lysa?"

"Yes, I'm Lysa Ulunova, Princess! Thank you for remembering me!"

<b>

I introduced Lysa to Vivi and Mia, who were looking at her with puzzled expressions, trying to suppress the noise.

But aren't we just casually greeting each other? Why is no one addressing the fact that I was called "princess"?!

<b>

"I'm sorry for the noise..."

<b>

Lysa placed her hand behind her head and looked around with an apologetic smile.

<b>

"We're in a rush to finish construction; otherwise, we won't make it in time!"

<b>

So it really was a construction site.

<b>

According to Lysa, they were preparing temporary accommodations for the main knight order that would arrive later and their support staff.

<b>

"Honestly! Our representative is working us too hard!! It's a non-stop whirlwind! I thought I could rest once I arrived in Amkam, but our squad leader told me to supervise the construction of the accommodations! Ah! I'm definitely going to overwork myself and die without even getting a boyfriend!!"

"Th-that's... tough..."

<b>

I unintentionally learned about the knight order's harsh working conditions.

Vivi and Mia exchanged sympathetic glances with Lysa, who was looking up at the sky in despair.

<b>

"Ah! I'm sorry for stopping you! You came to see... the head, didn't you?"

<b>

Lysa suddenly clapped her hands as if she just realized something and said to me.

When I confirmed that I did, she told me that Papa Howard and the others had left the office a little while ago for a late lunch and should be in the great hall by now.

<b>

"Ah! I have to go back too, or I'll get scolded by Captain Magritte! Princess! Please meet again soon!!"

<b>

After telling me that, Lysa hurriedly ran off, surprisingly busy.

Vivi and Mia looked at her with exasperated expressions as they watched her go.

<b>

And so we headed through the chaos towards the great hall where Papa Howard and the others were.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The distance from Dekkenbel to Coop Town is approximately 300 kilometers, connected by a paved and well-maintained road.

The road is lined with hexagonal basalt stones about 50 centimeters in size, making it sturdy.

The width of the road exceeds 5 meters, allowing horse-drawn carriages to easily pass each other.

It serves as one of the arteries of the nation, spanning the center of the continent from end to end.

<b>

Now, on that road, a group consisting of dozens of horsemen and several carriages was heading north.

<b>

The riders were carrying backpacks, clad in armor on their arms and legs, and wore cyan-blue magical orbs on their chests.

The occasional glimmer of light from that group made it clear they were not an ordinary traveling party.

<b>

Leading the way were a dozen neatly lined-up horses, with a particularly large ebony carriage being escorted by the surrounding riders.

<b>

A single rider approached the carriage.

He ran alongside it, removed his hood, and lightly knocked on the carriage window a few times.

<b>

The face that appeared from under the hood belonged to a man in his late thirties with sharp, fierce eyes.

His short black hair was slicked back, and his mustached mouth was tightly closed. Several scars ran across his cheeks, indicating that he was someone who had seen many battlefields.

<b>

After a brief pause, the carriage window slowly began to slide open.

The man who peeked out from the luxuriously decorated window looked at the rider with a disdainful expression.

<b>

Inside the window, the man who had peeked out was seen holding a champagne glass.

Further inside, a woman could be seen holding a bottle of champagne that had been poured into the glass.

Though her face was not visible, it was clear she was wearing a dress with a large neckline. They were likely individuals whose profession involved serving drinks and engaging in conversation.

<b>

However, the rider ignored such presences and spoke directly to the master of the carriage.

<b>

"Representative Fourier. It seems we will arrive in Coop Town as scheduled on the 25th of the Second Moon."

"Hmm... I wonder if the seven-day journey from Dekkenbel to Amkam is taking a bit too long?"

<b>

When the rider reported that the travel schedule was going smoothly, the man called Fourier inside the carriage let out a sigh through his prominent nose, expressing dissatisfaction with the schedule.

<b>

"Under normal circumstances, it would take more than ten days to cover this distance with only the minimum supplies. You should understand that this is quite a forced march."

"Well... but how long do you think it has been since we left the royal capital of Meridies? It's already been two months! And we still haven't even arrived at the destination! How disgraceful! Don't you understand that the citizens are demanding results as soon as possible?!"

"With all due respect, it's only been two months. Don't you think it's an achievement to have brought this squad this far in just two months?"

<b>

While the rider explained the urgency of the journey and that they were well aware of it, the man called Fourier still seemed dissatisfied.

At that moment, a nervous-looking man from the back of the carriage threw words at the rider with irritation.

<b>

"Captain Meyer! Even if you are part of the knight order, isn't it a bit too much to speak so freely to the representative?! Mr. Fourier is, after all, the head of this mission!"

"…Hmph, I don't mind, Clark. More importantly, Coop Town, right? Is it really okay? It's just a small rural town with a population of about 2,000, isn't it? Can we really procure satisfactory materials there? Shouldn't we have taken care of that in Dekkenbel?"

<b>

The man grimaced as he criticized the rider, but Fourier admonished him and threw further dissatisfaction back at the man called Meyer.

<b>

"Coop Town is the northernmost and last commercial area of our country, with over ten thousand visitors per day. Its scale is certainly not small. Moreover, it was the representative's decision to minimize the load and hurry along."

"…Hmph. Is that so? Then there shouldn't be any issues with procuring materials on-site?"

"The advanced team, Magritte, has already made contact with Amkam. She is currently preparing for our reception."

"Hmm, a pigeon message... Very well, I leave it to you. Cedric Meyer, captain of the 12th Mobile Heavy Knight Brigade. Please hurry."

"I'll take care of it, representative Cameron Fourier."

<b>

With a wave of his hand, as if to indicate there was nothing more to discuss, Cameron Fourier closed the carriage window.

Inside, the man called Clark continued to glare at Cedric Meyer until the window was completely shut.

<b>

"He's still saying whatever he wants, as always..."

"Don't say that, Kyle. If you think of it as him spurring us on, it shouldn't feel too bad, right?"

<b>

As Cedric moved away from the carriage, the man called Kyle drew closer on his horse.

Kyle, with his soft blonde hair flowing in the breeze, furrowed his brows as he spoke.

<b>

"Well, if the captain says so, that's fine."

"The fact is, it was that gentleman who brought this squad this far in this time."

"However, it's us and those subordinates over there who are actually doing the work, right?"

<b>

As he said that, Kyle glanced back at the carriage and the rider ahead.

The carriage was a simple covered wagon with seats strapped in for over ten people, unlike the luxurious one Fourier had been in.

<b>

Inside that covered wagon, many people were busy confirming and producing documents, their eyes shadowed from lack of sleep. More than half of them were even unconscious from the swaying of the carriage.

All of them were the clerks managing the funds and schedule of this mission.

Meanwhile, their superior, the rider, was going through the documents presented from the carriage one after another. He couldn't afford to lose consciousness while riding. His shadows were deeper than anyone else's.

<b>

Kyle watched this scene and quietly lowered his gaze.

<b>

"Still, the representative is the representative."

"Isn't it also that representative who keeps demanding small breaks? It's normal to stay in a lodging town for two or three days..."

"Those are necessary to replenish our spirits. That was part of the schedule, after all."

"They're excellent personnel; it's a waste. Shouldn't we just recruit them for our office?"

<b>

Kyle looked back at the people behind him again. Did the rider's eyes seem more bloodshot than before, or was it just his imagination?

As their superior, he was not allowed to ride in a carriage and had to proceed on horseback alone, meaning he couldn't afford to sleep during the journey.

Kyle shook his head slowly again.

<b>

"Our office also has excellent personnel. In any case, that's something to discuss after everything is over... First and foremost, arriving at Amkam is the priority."

<b>

Kyle responded with "That's right" to Meyer's words and closed his mouth.

<b>

They would arrive at Amkam in three days.

He hoped that nothing would happen along the way and that those clerks wouldn't lose any more of their nerves or sleep.

Kyle Arvin thought about such things as he rode alongside Cedric Meyer.

<b>

----------------

"Suu! What is this all about?!"

"Nyaa! Dana?! Wha—what the heck?!"

"I'm asking you, when did this get so... 'impressive'?!"

"Nyaa… b-but don't just grab them... Dana, you have your own, so why don't you—nnya… just focus on them!"

"What's the fun in that?! It's because they're someone else's that it’s interesting! I'm a certified b**b enthusiast!"

"Nya?! Did you really just say that?!"

"Hmm? Uh… right, what is... oh, I see."

"D-don't… don't say it out loud!"

"...Oh, it's just a push-up."

"Wha—! Don’t give that away!!"

"So, Suu, you really wanted them to be bigger, huh? In that case, I'll give them a daily squeeze for you! Heh heh!"

"Huh? W-why does it come to that?"

"When I give 'em a good squeeze, they’re bound to grow! Just look at the results over here! Haha!"

"Wait, what?!"

"..."

"Eh? Colin? Mia?! What… what's happening?"

"Isn’t it proof enough? Here, check it out!"

"Nyah! R-really…? But… if that’s the case…"

"What? Did something happen?!"

"Uh?! Vivi?!"

"Look, Suu, there are some things I can help with… and some I can't."

"Uh…"

"W-what's with you all looking away like that?"

"Vivi… I-it’s really… nothing, you know?"

"…"

"Why are you all ignoring me? What's going on here?!"

"...Uh, um… Sorry… okay?"

"Everyone! Look this way—right now!"
