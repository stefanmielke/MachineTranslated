# Chapter 207: Karen's Strike

With legs like a wolf, it kicks the ground, and its massive body tears through the air.

A dreadful howl echoed from the jagged fangs lined up in its open mouth, trying to rip apart the small body of Karen.

<b>

But those fangs do not reach Karen.

The moment the vicious fangs cut through the air, a shock from below strikes the magic beast's right shoulder.

Karen, who dodged the fangs with a graceful motion, thrust her fist upward in a single blow.

<b>

The uppercut unleashed from her lower body, which seemed to be one with the earth, obliterated the magic beast's shoulder in an instant.

Having destroyed one of its four arms from the root, Karen swiftly spun around and slipped to the right side of the magic beast.

Then, placing both hands against the beast's side, she exhaled explosively and delivered a heavy blow from her palms.

<b>

Compared to the giant body of the composite magic beast, Karen's physique was far too small.

However, the strike unleashed by her petite body easily lifted that heavy bulk into the air.

As if the spot where Karen had touched exploded, the magic beast was sent flying, rolling its massive body onto the ground.

The side that Karen had touched was deeply indented, indicating it had received a strong impact.

<b>

The body of the blown-away composite magic beast rolled across the cobblestones.

At the end of its roll lay the Terra Dog that Karen had defeated.

<b>

The body of the Terra Dog, which had touched the composite magic beast, was being absorbed into it like water absorbed by a sponge.

In no time, the wounds on its shoulder and side that Karen had inflicted vanished.

<b>

Seeing that dreadful event, Karen frowned.

This is what the teachers had said: it is trying to absorb more parasites by devouring other individuals, thereby increasing its power.

If it absorbs even more magic beasts than this, it could become an even more troublesome existence.

I must defeat this thing here and now, no matter what!

<b>

<b>

A gentle wind enveloped Karen's body.

Cordelia's support magic slightly restored Karen's depleted magical power.

Placing her hand on her chest, Karen savored the magic of Cordelia that surrounded her.

<b>

That's right! I'm not alone right now. Cordelia is right behind me!

With that thought as her strength, Karen kicked the ground again towards the composite magic beast.

<b>

As Karen approached in a straight line, the composite magic beast swung down its massive arms like a giant baboon.

Even the mass that fell from above, like a log, was easily dodged by Karen's body, which slipped away like a willow leaf in the wind.

<b>

Karen grabbed onto its arm, twisting her body as if climbing a giant tree, and mounted its massive back.

Straddling the huge, distorted centaur-like back, Karen took a moment to catch her breath and then infused all her strength into her back with 'Ki'.

<b>

As if a whirlpool was forming, the back that received the 'Ki' caved in. The shock caused the giant body to sink into the ground.

After delivering the blow, Karen immediately jumped off the magic beast to create distance.

<b>

The composite magic beast let out a dreadful scream from the pain of its shattered back.

Its back bent at an angle, showing signs of flesh crumbling away.

<b>

However, the collapse of its flesh quickly stopped, and the meat began to swell and repair itself.

<b>

<b>

"…I guess I need to properly lower it and infuse 'Ki' on top of that. …There's just not enough time."

<b>

Karen, confirming that, muttered regretfully as she readied her stance.

<b>

"Do you need time?"

<b>

Cordelia, who had come close, asked Karen without taking her eyes off the composite magic beast.

<b>

"Yes! Just a little, at least 30 seconds… no, just 20 seconds would be enough to infuse 'Ki'!"

<b>

"If we can stop its movements during that time, that would be ideal."

<b>

"That's the plan, but…"

<b>

No matter how much damage is dealt, it recovers in just about five seconds.

The large wound on its back that was just inflicted is already trying to close. Even with such a big injury, it seems to take only about ten seconds to heal.

While there is enough of a gap to deliver consecutive strikes, if everything is healed afterward, it would be meaningless.

Continuously delivering half-hearted attacks would clearly favor the beast with its high recovery ability.

To win, she must land a decisive blow that can definitely take it down, but there is no time to infuse 'Ki' for that.

This could easily lead to a deadlock.

<b>

"In that case, I will manage somehow!"

"What? Cordy?! What are you saying?!"

"I said I would support Karen! Leave it to me!"

<b>

As Karen looked on in surprise, Cordelia wrapped her arms around her back and whispered, "Trust me."

She then distanced herself from Karen, quickly chanting a short incantation, and Cordelia's figure blended into the wind.

<b>

"Cordy!!"

<b>

As Karen called out to Cordelia, the healed composite magic beast let out a roar.

When its gaze swept around and locked onto Karen, it wrinkled its nose with hatred and let out a low growl that seemed to roll across the ground.

Immediately after, the composite magic beast lowered its body and kicked the ground with its wolf-like hind legs towards Karen again.

<b>

"Tch!!"

<b>

Karen barely dodged the beast that closed the distance in an instant.

As she passed by, Karen delivered a straight punch to the side of the composite magic beast's head.

In that moment, the beast's brain was jolted, causing it to slightly slip at its feet.

But that was only for a moment.

As the beast slid its body, it swung one of its upper arms down towards Karen, who was passing by.

In a split second, Karen placed her hand on the beast's fist, trying to use its momentum to change her position, but her eyes widened in shock.

The fist she touched transformed before her eyes into the face of a Terra Dog, opening wide to bite off Karen's hand with its fangs.

In an instant, Karen sank her body down, dodging the fangs, and kicked upward from below the Terra Dog's jaw.

<b>

Indeed, this thing is absorbing magic beasts and making them its own.

Cordelia is trying to do something, but I can't let it interfere!

I don't know what tricks it might use. Therefore, I will strike relentlessly to prevent it from doing anything!

<b>

Karen's foot, wrapped in magical power, radiated a particularly bright red light.

<b>

Sliding under the magic beast's belly, Karen placed her hands on the ground to support herself and unleashed a series of red kicks.

Using her supporting hand as an axis, Karen spun her body widely, delivering rapid strikes to the magic beast's belly, chest, arms, and jaw.

Red light swirled around.

Karen's spinning leg kicked the magic beast's body upward from below.

As the magic beast was kicked up by Karen, its upper body began to rise.

<b>

When it stood only on its wolf-like hind legs, the magic beast's demeanor changed.

The movements of its four arms, which had been swinging to swat away Karen, suddenly stopped.

<b>

"?!"

<b>

Karen also noticed the sudden change.

The magic beast stood on its two hind legs, spreading its four arms, facing forward while its ugly baboon-like face looked up.

As if enduring something, its entire body trembled slightly.

<b>

"Uaaah――――――aaah!!"

"Cordy?!"

<b>

At that moment, a scream-like cry echoed from Cordelia.

<b>

The composite magic beast stood only on its wolf-like hind legs.

Cordelia, who should have hidden away, was clinging to its right leg.

<b>

"Cordy? What are you doing?!!"

"K-Karen!! Now… while it's…!!――――――!!"

<b>

'Protection of the Familiar'

That is a unique skill possessed by Cordelia.

It allows her to place a magic beast she touches under her control for a certain period.

Now, Cordelia was using that skill to stop the movements of the composite magic beast.

However, to suppress the magic beast, both mental and physical burdens are extremely high.

Especially against such a large and powerful magic beast, the strain is even greater.

<b>

"Uaaah――――――!!"

"Cordy! No! Get away!!"

"I can… I-I’m fine!――――! I can hold it down for about 5 minutes!――! I-I can do it easily! So! Hurry! Hurry――!!"

<b>

The strength in Cordelia's eyes as she looked at Karen spoke volumes.

For Karen's sake, she could do this much! She could endure! She would show it!

Perhaps she might not last even a minute.

Even so, Cordelia shouted that she would hold it down for Karen.

If that’s the case, then it is my responsibility to accept her feelings!!

<b>

"!! I understand, Cordy! Just for a little while… please!"

"Leave it to me!――――――!!"

<b>

Seeing Cordelia desperately suppressing her cries, a clear determination surfaced in Karen's eyes.

Karen's fingers swiftly formed seals, and she began to chant incantations with half-closed eyes.

<b>

"Ametsukigami, I call upon the fire of the princess of the rain, Ametsumikami. I beseech the mountain gods who embrace the flames, Kagutsuchi, and the priestess of the flame, Koridona.

With the great whirlpool of that passion, I implore the eternal gods and the gods of this world to cleanse those who would harm my father, my mother, and my siblings!"

<b>

'Ki' filled Karen's lower abdomen, chest, and the area behind her forehead.

In response to the priestess's call, the divine energy of fire spiraled upward along that axis.

<b>

"Cordy, get back!!"

<b>

Karen stepped forward in one breath.

Her target was just below the chest, around the solar plexus.

Now that it was standing on its hind legs, that was right in front of Karen.

She could clearly see that something dreadful lay beyond it.

<b>

"Divine Blade Secret Technique! 'Tornado Breaker Palm'!"

<b>

Both palms pierced the solar plexus of the composite magic beast.

At the same time, a shockwave erupted from below, resonating throughout the area.

<b>

Cordelia, who had tried to distance herself from the spot at Karen's words, was caught off guard and let out a small voice as she stumbled.

<b>

The shockwave unleashed by the flame priestess caused the divine energy within the target to swirl.

The large vertical whirlpool of 'Ki' rapidly converged within the magic beast, greatly amplifying its destructive power.

The magic beast's body shook violently from the tempest raging within.

<b>

Then, the converged whirlpool exploded all at once.

The torrent imbued with divine energy destroyed the magic beast's body from the inside as it burst forth.

The composite magic beast was not given a moment to utter a dying cry, as it was gouged out of the 'linear magical life form' that resided deep within its solar plexus and shattered into pieces.

The beast's body split vertically from the center, its skull crushed along with its spine, and it collapsed onto the cobblestones, shaking them violently.

<b>

A massive amount of blood gushed from the wound, and chunks of flesh writhed grotesquely, but the healing process did not begin.

No flesh would rise from that large wound anymore.

The regenerative ability of the 'linear magical life form' was no longer present.

<b>

Confirming that, Karen slowly regulated her breathing and quietly released her residual energy.
