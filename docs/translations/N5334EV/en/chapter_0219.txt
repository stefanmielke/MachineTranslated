# 207 Karen's Blow

Kicking the ground with his wolf-like hind legs, his huge body rips through the atmosphere at once.

A fearless bark echoed from behind the messy fangs that lined its open mouth as it tried to tear apart the petite Karen's body.

<blank>

But its fangs do not reach Karen.

The moment the vicious fangs cut through the air, a downward impact exits the right shoulder of the magical beast.

Karen, who had dodged the fangs with a yurauri, then launched her fist up from below in a single blow.

<blank>

The uppercut released from the lower half of the body, which stomped as if it had become one with the earth, instantly exploded the shoulder of the demonic beast.

After destroying one of the four arms from the root, Karen turns her body on the spot and slides to the right side of the magical beast.

He then placed his hands on the sides of the magical beast, exhaled an explosive breath, and struck a heavy blow from his palms.

<blank>

Karen's body is much too small compared to the huge body of the synthetic magical beast.

However, the blow from his petite body easily lifted his huge, heavy frame into the air.

It was as if an explosion had occurred where Karen's palm had struck the beast, sending its huge body tumbling to the ground.

The side of the body that Karen touched was greatly reduced inward, as if to indicate that it had received a strong impact.

<blank>

The body of the blown synthetic magical beast rolls on the cobblestones with a rumble.

The rolling body came to a stop, and the terra dog that had been killed by Karen was lying on the ground.

<blank>

The body of a terra dog that touches a synthetic magical beast is absorbed by the synthetic magical beast like water absorbed by a sponge.

Before I see it, the wounds on my shoulder and side that I just received from Karen disappear.

<blank>

Karen raises her eyebrows when she sees the fearless event.

Does this mean that they are trying to absorb more parasites and gain more power by eating other individuals, as the doctors said?

If they take in more magical beasts than they have now, they could become even more troublesome.

After all, this guy must be defeated here and now, no matter what it takes!

<blank>

<blank>

A gentle wind wraps around Karen's body.

Cordelia's support magic slightly restores Karen's depleted magical energy.

Karen places her hand on her chest and bites down on the cordillerian magic she wears.

<blank>

That's right!　I am not alone now. Cordelia is behind me!

With the power of this thought, Karen again kicks the ground toward the synthetic magical beast.

<blank>

The synthetic hexenbiest strikes down its stiff arms like a giant baboon at Karen as she comes toward it in a straight line.

Karen's body easily avoids the log-like mass coming down from directly above it like a willow leaf in the wind.

<blank>

Karen grabbed onto the arm, turned her body, and climbed up the huge tree to reach the huge body.

Straddling the back of a huge, distorted human horse, Karen took a breath without pause, and then slammed her ki into its back with all her might.

<blank>

As if in a whirlpool, the back of the body is shot with "Ki" and sinks into the ground. The impact causes the huge body to sink to the ground.

After delivering the blow, Karen immediately jumps down and distances herself from the magical beast.

<blank>

The pain from the shattering of its back caused the synthetic magical beast to scream fearlessly.

The back of the fish is bent in the shape of a bow, and the flesh looks as if it is crumbling.

<blank>

However, the disintegration of the flesh stops immediately, and the flesh begins to rise and repair itself.

<blank>

<blank>

I think we need to unload the ...... and work on "Ki" on top of it. ......I just don't have enough time."

<blank>

After confirming this, Karen muttered quietly in frustration as she regained her stance.

<blank>

Do you need more time?"

<blank>

Cordelia, who has come to the side, asks Karen, keeping her eyes on the synthetic magical beast without letting her guard down.

<blank>

'Yeah!　Just a little bit, at least 30 seconds ...... no!　I just need 20 seconds to knead Ki."

<blank>

'So you just hope you can stop moving in the meantime.'

<blank>

Yes, but ......"

<blank>

No matter how much damage you do, he'll recover in a mere five seconds or so.

The wound on his back, which was gouged out just now, is about to be closed. Even with such a large wound, it takes about 10 seconds to repair.

The gap is enough to put in a series of shots, but it is useless if everything is recovered after it has been cut down.

<blank>

If you keep putting in a series of half-hearted attacks, it is clear that the more resilient side has the better of the two.

The only way to win is to strike a big blow that will surely slaughter the enemy, but we can't find enough time to develop the "Ki" to do so.

This is a dead end if done poorly.

<blank>

Then I'll take care of it!"

What?　Cody?　What are you talking about? !"

I said, "I will support Karen.　I'll take care of it."

<blank>

To Karen's surprise, Cordelia put her arm around her back and pulled her face close, murmuring quietly, "Please believe me.

She removes her body from Karen and continues with a short congratulatory chant, and Cordelia's figure is lost in the wind.

<blank>

Cody!

<blank>

As if to drown out Karen's voice calling for Cordelia, a synthetic magical beast, healed from its wounds, let out a cry.

When the eyes of the hexenbiest looking around catch sight of Karen, it wrinkles its nose in hatred and lets out a low growl as it rolls round and round on the ground.

Immediately thereafter, the lowered synthetic hexenbiest turned to face Karen and again kicked the ground with its wolf-like hind legs.

<blank>

Tsk!"

<blank>

In a split second, Karen ducks just in time to see the beast come between them.

As they pass each other, Karen slams a square fist into the side of the synthetic magical beast's head.

A moment later, the brain-plasma-shaken magical beast slid slightly off its feet.

But only temporarily.

The hexenbiest slides down the body and comes up to slam one of its upper arms into Karen as they try to pass each other.

Karen's eyes widened in surprise as she quickly put her hand on the fist of the magical beast and tried to use its momentum to change her own standing position.

The fist of the magical beast that held her hand turned into the face of a terra dog in the blink of an eye, and opened its mouth wide as if it wanted to bite Karen's hand off with its fangs.

Instantly, Karen sank her body, ducked its fangs, and kicked its teller-dog jaws from below.

<blank>

After all, this guy has taken a hexenbiest and made it his own.

Cordillera is trying to do something now, but we can't have a cumulative effect on it!

I don't know what kind of moves this guy is going to make. Then I'm going to beat him with a number of moves so that he doesn't have time to do anything!

<blank>

Karen's feet, clad in magic power, emit a distinctive red light.

<blank>

Karen slides under the belly of the magical beast, where she lands a hand on the ground to support her body and fires a series of red kicks.

Karen turns her body wide on the axis of her supporting hand, and with her centrifugal leg, she strikes down the demon beast's belly, chest, arm, and chin at high speed.

Red light swirls.

Karen's legs, spinning like a spinning top, kick up the body of the magical beast from below.

Kicked up by Karen, the upper body of the magical beast floats away.

<blank>

When it got into a standing posture with only its wolf-like hind legs, the demonic beast's appearance changed.

The four arms that had been swinging around to try to beat off Karen, who had been kicking from below, stopped moving.

<blank>

?

<blank>

Karen also notices this sudden change.

The magical beast stands on only two hind legs, its four arms outstretched, its upper body facing forward with its ugly, baboon-like beast face turned upward.

His whole body was trembling slightly, as if he was enduring something.

<blank>

Aaaaahhhh ------aaaahhh!"

Cody?

<blank>

There, Cordelia's scream-like cry echoed.

<blank>

A synthetic magical beast that stands on only its hind legs like a wolf.

Cordilia, who should have disappeared at some point, is clinging to its right leg.

<blank>

Cody?　What the hell are you doing?

I'll be back soon! While you're at ......!　I'm in ------!

<blank>

The Blessing of the Servant Devil."

It is a unique skill that Cordilleras possess.

It is a skill that allows the user to bring a magical beast that he touches under his control for a certain period of time.

Now Cordilia was using her skills to stop the synthetic magical beast from moving.

However, it takes a great deal of mental and physical strength to suppress the demonic beasts.

And even more so when dealing with such a large and powerful magical beast.

<blank>

Aaaaahhhh ------!!!"

Cody!　Get away from me!　Get off of me!

I'd go to ......, my husband is a great ...... husband!　I'd ----!　For about five minutes, you can go to ......!　--I can hold it down for about five minutes!　I'll show ...... that I can hold it down with room to spare!　I'll show you!　Quickly!　Quickly!

<blank>

Cordelia's eyes staring at Karen speak powerfully.

I can do this for Karen!　I can endure!　I'll show you!　I will do it!

Maybe it won't even last a minute.

Still, Cordelia shouts that she will show them that she will hold them back for Karen.

If that's the case, then it's your responsibility to accept her feelings!

<blank>

"!　All right, Cody!　Just ...... for a minute please!"

I'll take care of it."　------!!!!"

<blank>

Karen looks at Cordelia, who is doing her best to suppress her screams, and her eyes are clear and determined.

Karen's fingers made a quick, flowing sign, and then she turned her half-lidded eyes and began to recite a prayer.

<blank>

Ametsukikami, I appeal to Iniru, the fire goddess of Ametsumikami. Kagutsuchi, who presides over the flame-hugging mountains, and the priestess of the Flame Princess Corydona, beg for your favor.

I beg the gods of this world and the gods of the everlasting world to hear how I will use the maelstrom of my passion to purify those who seek to avenge my father, my mother, and my brother!

<blank>

Ki is enriched in Karen's lower abdomen, chest, and tanden in the back of her forehead.

At the miko's call, the divine energy of the flame spirals up its axis.

<blank>

Cody, get back!

<blank>

Karen steps in with one breath.

The target is a little below the breast. The area around the dove's tail in human terms.

Now that she is on her hind legs, it is right in front of Karen.

Karen can clearly see that there is something fearless behind it.

<blank>

The inner secrets of the Divine Blade Urakengen Style! "Clothing Vortex Rupture Palm!"

<blank>

Both palms puncture the synthetic magical beast's dove tail.

At the same time, a shock echoes around the area as if it is coming up from the ground.

<blank>

Cordilia, who was about to leave the place at Karen's words, was unexpectedly taken off her feet and rolled over with a small cry.

<blank>

The impact of the fire priestess's shot caused the divine ch'i to swirl inside the target.

The torrent of ki, which swirls in a large vertical arc, rapidly converges inside the magical beast, greatly increasing its destructive power.

The body of the magical beast shakes violently as the storm rages within its body.

<blank>

Then, the converged vortex exploded all at once.

The vertically swirling torrent of divine energy destroys the body of the demonic beast from the inside at the same time as the explosion dissipates.

The synthetic magical beast was not even given time to make a decisive cry, and the aggregate of the "linear magical life form" located deep inside the dove tail was gouged out, crushing it into tiny pieces.

The body of the magical beast is ripped vertically from the center, the entire spinal cord and cranium are crushed, and the beast falls down on its back, shaking the cobblestone pavement.

<blank>

A great deal of blood gushes from the wound, and pieces of flesh wriggle fearlessly, but the wound does not begin to heal.

The flesh no longer rises from that great scar.

The restorative power of the "linear magical life form" was no longer there.

<blank>

After confirming this, Karen slowly breathed in and then quietly released her zanshin.
