# Chapter 95: Melancholic Suzy

Daniel Davis is a male student seated in Group 4.

I've seen him a few times this week, so it's not like we're strangers.

Of course, that's partly because the impression from our first meeting was too vivid...

<b>

<b>

On that day, my twisted fist sharply struck his face, and it sent him flying beautifully.

I thought to myself, "Will he become a star?" as he flew!

<b>

But! Even though he said something quite rude, it was extremely reckless of me to lash out and turn one student into a star on the very day I entered the dorm—it's beyond crazy!

I should have lowered my strength to the minimum level, but I remember vividly how I snapped back to reality the moment I saw him flying, and how the blood drained from my face.

<b>

Fortunately, he landed right in the middle of some bushes, so it only resulted in a bit of a scrape.

I rushed over to him with tears in my eyes, and when I confirmed he was breathing, I felt such relief...

Ah! It feels like such a déjà vu!!

Of course! I immediately cast the single-target full recovery spell, "Bright Heal"!

<b>

When he regained consciousness right away, I was so relieved that I collapsed to the ground.

I apologized to him with the intensity of a deep bow, but it seemed he couldn't grasp the situation immediately. Well, that's understandable...

<b>

Once he understood the situation, Davis-kun, in turn, began to apologize profusely, saying it was very rude to a lady!

It seems he was present when the lucky accident happened at the school gate, and he had been staring wide-eyed behind Irvin...

He kept apologizing, saying he was very sorry for that too, and he even rubbed his head against the ground!

<b>

In the end, it was all Irvin's (the lucky accident's) fault! Feeling quite sorry myself, I rubbed my head against the ground too.

<b>

No, no! It’s me who should be apologizing! It’s all my fault!!

<b>

As we both refused to yield, our bowing session seemed like it would go on forever, when the gardener "big brother" stepped in, laughing in disbelief, and said, "For now, he seems to be fine, but to be safe, he should rest today. I'll stay with him, so you should head back to the dorm," and he intervened to stop our bowing battle.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Well, to put it simply, my first encounter with him was the worst.

I felt terribly sorry about it...

Still! Just from our brief interactions, I thought he was a very likable person!

Even after such a terrible first meeting, he forgave me smoothly!!

<b>

After that, we exchanged greetings right after the entrance ceremony, and I've seen him a few times elsewhere, but the more we talked, the more I realized what a good person he is.

Yes, he's a good guy. Truly a good guy!

<b>

Yet! I am wary of him and am trying to keep my distance!

The reason for that is...

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey! Wait a minute! Do you have business with our Suzy?"

"Ah... no, I just happened to see her and called out, but... was that bad?"

<b>

Irvin and Lombard stepped in front of Davis-kun as he approached us.

Even though he's wearing our uniform, it's normal to be somewhat cautious when a stranger approaches outside of school.

Yes, yes, my guys are doing their bodyguard job well! Good job, good job!

<b>

...Good job, but why? I have an uneasy feeling about this encounter between Irvin and Davis-kun...

Yes, it's unsettling. And incredibly anxious!! Why is that?!

<b>

"Sorry, but I can't let a stranger get close to our Suzy."

"Ah! I see, that's true! I should have introduced myself. I'm Daniel Davis from Group 4! Nice to meet you!"

"Oh? Oh! I'm Irvin Haggard from Group 1! This is Lombard Blough, also from Group 1."

"Irvin Haggard! So you're the one! You're the top of the martial arts exam! I've been wanting to talk to you! It's an honor to meet you!"

"...Oh, uh! Nice to meet you... Huh? Daniel... Davis? Davis? Ah... you! Could it be that you were the one who got sent flying by Suzy before the entrance ceremony?!!"

"...Ah, yes, embarrassingly enough, that recognition is probably correct... that's me."

"I see! It's you!! Wow—amazing!! That's quite something!!"

"...Eh?"

<b>

...Eh?

<b>

"To be alive after getting punched by Suzy! I never thought I'd meet someone like that outside of Amukam! You're incredible!!"

"Eh? Eh? Is that... really... so? I mean, I'm alive?"

"Wow—I wanted to meet you! You're amazing!! Right?! Lombard! You think so too, right!!"

<b>

What is Irvin saying?! I have no idea what he's talking about!!!

And Lombard is nodding along!

Wait! Even Mia looks impressed, nodding with her arms crossed?!

What is going on here?!

Hey everyone! Isn't your perception of me a bit too rude?!

<b>

Whoa! Irvin! Don't laugh and keep slapping Davis-kun's back! That's rude to someone you just met!

Ah! Now he's even putting his arm around him!! That's not how you maintain distance with someone you just met... wait? Why is Davis-kun also putting his arm around him and laughing happily?!

Why are these two hitting it off so well in such a short time?!

What are these guys?! Huh? Seriously!!

<b>

<b>

"Cloud-sama! Cloud-sama!! Do you know Davis-kun from Group 4?!"

"Eh?!"

<b>

While I was astonished by the communication skills of the two, Kuu Meruru clung to my back and asked excitedly.

I was a bit surprised by her unusually high energy.

<b>

"Wow, amazing! Not only Haggard-kun, but even Davis-kun is here!!"

"Eh? Eh?! What’s going on? Why is it suddenly so lively?"

"Because, because! Irvin Haggard from Group 1, Gordon Weiner from Group 3, and Daniel Davis from Group 4 are the top three most popular boys among this year's new students!!"

<b>

Huh? Is that so?

<b>

"Among the upperclassmen and the female students, these three are the top popular ones!! And now, to have two of them here together! Wow—what should I do!!"

"Eh? It's Irvin, right? Huh? Huh?"

"That's right! It's Haggard-kun! He's the most popular among the girls!!"

"Eh?!"

<b>

Huh? Where do I even start with this?!

I'm surprised that Meruru had a face like Mia and Haru's, but... what are the female students doing?!

More importantly, it's Irvin, right? Huh? Irvin is the most popular? What is that! It's Irvin!!

I don't get it... Ah, if I say this, Bibi might strangle me... but still, you know?

<b>

Well, it's true... it's true that the Haggard brothers are good-looking if you just look at their features.

Irvin, compared to Ryder, is a bit less, but he's still decent-looking...

But... you know? It's Irvin!!

Ah—this is bad! I don't understand the girls' feelings of squealing over Irvin!

Whoa, even Karen is slightly blushing, clenching her hands, and staring at the two-shot of Irvin and Davis-kun?!

<b>

And right, hmm, Davis-kun too...

It's true that Davis-kun has a sweet face that appeals to girls... and his personality isn't bad either.

So, I guess he’s popular with the girls...

<b>

Still! Watching those two guys hanging out, I can only feel a dreadful premonition! Why?!

<b>

<b>

"Wow! Look, Cloud-sama! The two of them are so close! Ah! Their faces are so close!! It's precious! It's too precious!!"

"Eh?!"

<b>

Wait a minute, Meruru?!

Are you perhaps a resident of the land of the corrupted sea?!

Did you see those two with that kind of perspective this whole time?!!

<b>

Oh no...! What is this?

Over there, the boys are getting more and more excited!

And behind me, my classmate with cat ears is bouncing happily, and my roommate has stars shining in her eyes!!

<b>

Am I the only one feeling chaos in this situation, almost losing my mind?! Huh!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Thus, when Bibi and Selkie returned from the reception, I was there, holding my head and groaning, while my companions were having a strange time of excitement!
