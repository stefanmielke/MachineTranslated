# 95 Melancholic Suzy

Daniel Davis is a male student seated in Class 4.

We have seen each other several times in the past week, so it is not that we are strangers.

Of course, that's partly because the first impression is too vivid. ......

<blank>

<blank>

That day, my twisted fist caught him sharply in the face and blew him clean off.

I was so excited that I wondered if I was going to become a star! It flew so well that I wondered if it would turn into a star!

<blank>

But! Even though he said too much to me, it's still too much of a bad thing that he instantly put his hand out and turned one of his students into a star on the very day he entered the dormitory!

I remember that I came to my senses in an instant when I saw him blow up, and my blood drained instantly, even though my power should have been reduced to the lowest level.

<blank>

Fortunately, the area he flew into was in the midst of vegetation, so he only barely managed to gouge out a portion of it.

I can't tell you how relieved I was to fly to him with tears in my eyes and see that he was breathing. ......

Ahh! It's kind of very déjà vu!

Of course! I quickly applied "Bright Heal," a single-person all-recovery magic!

<blank>

When he regained consciousness immediately, I was so relieved that I relaxed and sat there.

When he woke up, I apologized to him with the force of getting down on my knees, but he didn't seem to grasp the situation right away. Well, it's not too much to ask. ......

<blank>

When Mr. Davis understood the situation, he even began to get down on his knees, saying that he had been very rude to the woman!

Apparently, he was there at the school gate when the lucky break occurred and was poking his eyes out behind Irving's back. ......

He was very sorry about that as well!　and rubbed his head against the ground even more!

<blank>

After all, it was all Irving's (Lucky Skewer) fault, wasn't it? I rubbed my head and said, "I'm very sorry too.

<blank>

No, no! It's this way!　Oh, no! It's our fault!

<blank>

As we were about to bow down to each other endlessly, the gardener, the older man, laughed and said, "Well, he seems to be all right, but you should take care of him and rest today. I'll stay with him, so you should go back to the dormitory." He intervened between the two of us and admonished us against our battle on our knees.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, in a nutshell, my encounter with him was the worst thing like this.

We were very sorry about that. ......

Still! I thought his personality was very likeable, just from our brief correspondence!

And he easily forgave me after I put him through all that when we first met!

<blank>

We've exchanged greetings since then, right after the entrance ceremony, and we've seen each other several times elsewhere, but the more we talk, the more we learn about his personality.

Yes, he is a good guy. He is a really good guy!

<blank>

And yet! I am wary of him, and I am thinking of distancing myself from him!

That's why you should visit .............

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Hey! Wait a minute, you! What do you want with my Suzy?"

"Oh ......, no, I just happened to see you, so I called out to you ......, was that a bad idea?"

<blank>

Irving and Lombardo stood in front of Mr. Davis, who walked over here.

Even though they're wearing our quirky uniform, if a stranger approaches them outside of school, they're usually a little wary.

Oh, yeah, my guys are doing a great job as bodyguards! Good, good!

<blank>

......Elegant, but why? This encounter between Irving and Mr. Davis made me feel a certain, disturbing uneasiness. ......

Yeah, it's disturbing. And unsettling beyond belief! Why on earth?

<blank>

I'm sorry, but I can't let a stranger near my Suzy.

Oh." Yeah, that's true, too! I'm late to the party. I'm Daniel Davis from group 4! Nice to meet you!

Oh? Oh? I'm Irving Haggard of the first group! This is Lombard Brauk. Also from Group 1."

Irving Haggard! You're the one! The number one in the physical arts exam dunce! I've been meaning to talk to you! It's an honor to meet you!"

I'm at ....... Oh, hey! Nice to meet you ......? Daniel ...... Davis? Davis? Oh, ...... you! You're the guy that Suzy blew off before the entrance ceremony, by any chance?

"...... oh, yeah, I'm embarrassed to say that maybe that perception isn't wrong ......, I think that guy is me."

I see! You're the one! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! You're the man!

"...... what?"

<blank>

...... What?

<blank>

I can't believe he's still alive after being beaten up by Suzy! I didn't even think there was a guy like that outside of AMCAM! You're a great guy!

Huh? Huh? So, is that so ......? Is it ...... eh? Alive?"

No, I've always wanted to meet you! Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Hey, Ron! Ron! You'd like that, wouldn't you!

<blank>

What are you saying, Irving? I have no idea what you're talking about!

Don't nod your head and say, "Uh-huh," until Lombard!

Ha! Even Mia looked impressed and nodded her head while folding her arms?

What the heck?

Hey, guys! I think your perception of me is a little too rude, don't you?

<blank>

Oooh! Irving! Don't slap Mr. Davis on the back while he's laughing! That's rude to someone you just met!

Oh! This time, shoulder-to-shoulder! That's not how I feel when I meet someone for the first time at ......, huh? Why? Even Mr. Davis is rubbing shoulders with me and laughing like he's having a good time!

How did these two hit it off in such a short amount of time?

What are these guys? What? Seriously!

<blank>

<blank>

Cloud! Mr. Cloud! You know Mr. Davis from the fourth group?

Huh?

<blank>

I was astonished by the two communicators, and Cu Merle's voice bubbled up and she asked me about it.

I'm also a bit surprised by her strangely high tension.

<blank>

I was so excited to see not only Mr. Haggard, but also Mr. Davis! Not only is Mr. Haggard here, but I can't believe that Mr. Davis is here too!"

Huh? Eh? What's going on? You're getting excited all of a sudden, aren't you?"

Because, because." Mr. Irving Haggard of the first group. Mr. Gordon Weiner from class 3. And Mr. Daniel Davis from class 4 are the three most popular boys enrolled this year!

<blank>

Heh? Really?

<blank>

They're the top three among the girls in the inner school, including the upperclassmen! I can't believe that they're all together in a place like this right now! Oh my God, what am I going to do!"

What?" It's Irving, isn't it? Huh? Huh?"

Yes, sir! This is Mr. Haggard! He's the most popular among the girls!"

"Eeeeeeeeeeeee?

<blank>

What? Which of these should I start with?

I'm also surprised that Merle unexpectedly had a meek, haha side. ......, what are the internal student girls doing?

More importantly, it's Irving, right? Huh? Irving is the most popular? What's that? Because it's Irving, right?

I don't get it - ....... Oh, Bibi is going to choke me when I say this ......, because, hey?

<blank>

Well, sure, ......, I'm sure the Haggard brothers are good looking, if you just look at the modeling.

Irvin, too, is somewhat less than Ryder, but he's well put together, if you can call it that. ......

But ...... hey? It's Irving, right?

Oh, no! I don't know what it is about girls that makes them cackle at Irving!

Oooh, even Karen is looking at the two shots of Irving and Mr. Davis with her cheeks slightly upturned and her hands clasped!

<blank>

And, I see, ummm, Mr. Davis, too. ......

It's true that Mr. Davis has a sweet mask that girls like. ......, and he doesn't have a bad personality.

I see, it's very popular with girls. ......

<blank>

Still! When I see those two boys hanging out together, I can't help but have a fearful premonition! Why?

<blank>

<blank>

Wow! Look at them, Mr. Cloud! The two of you are so close together! Ah! Their faces are that close! So precious! Too precious!

"Uhhhhhhhh?"

<blank>

Wait a minute, Mr. Merle?

Are you by any chance a resident of the land of the rotting sea?

Could it be that I have been looking at you two that way since a while ago?

<blank>

Uhhhhhh ......! What the hell is this?

The boys over there are getting more and more excited on their own!

And then my nekomimi classmates, who are happily jumping up and down behind me, and my roommate, who is twinkling the stars in her eyes!

<blank>

Am I the only one? Am I the only one who feels the chaos in this place and is about to spill my brain juice all by myself? Haaaaah!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So when Bibi and Selkie came back from the reception, there I was, alone with my head in my hands, groaning, while the others were in a funny mood!
