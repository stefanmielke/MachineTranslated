# Chapter 196: Under the Red Moon

Around us, people in work clothes are bustling about.

These individuals are said to be university students who arrived on-site earlier. In other words, they are student part-timers.

These part-timers have been preparing the site in advance to facilitate the surveying.

<b>

Our carriage had arrived at the entrance of a sealed mine on the north side of the mountain.

The part-timers were setting up a base camp for this exploration in the spacious square in front of the mine.

<b>

They had been preparing for over a week, clearing paths to the surveying points at the mountain summit and leveling the surveying locations.

Thank you for your hard work.

<b>

By the way, the magic used to create the paths and level the ground is called "Rockbed Road."

It seems it was also frequently used in the restoration of Boltosnan.

The "Rock Wall" that our Bibi excels at and the act of pushing up cobblestones are derived from this magic.

<b>

Bibi said that with this magic, she could instantaneously create a path about 1 meter wide and 15 to 16 meters long. However, being able to do that at her age is apparently quite extraordinary.

It's a basic magic, but its applications for leveling muddy or uneven roads are very broad.

However, the finishing quality seems to vary significantly depending on the caster's skill.

<b>

Even so, I think setting up such a wide area of footing was quite a challenging task.

This time, including the total of 12 part-timers who did this work, our job will be to guard this surveying location.

<b>

<b>

And now, I find myself being assigned another role at this location, aside from being a guard.

According to Morris-sensei, this is actually the main job… What the heck is that!

<b>

"Now, this is the next cartridge."

<b>

I hand over the cylindrical object I had been holding to a part-timer and receive a new tube from Morris-sensei.

What I received is a metal tube about the thickness of a 500-milliliter PET bottle and approximately 70 centimeters long.

It seems to have a considerable weight.

<b>

The part-timer I handed it to is carrying it with another person, both straining to lift it.

But I don’t think they need to look at me with such horrified eyes while I hold it with one hand, do they?

Morris-sensei is holding it with one hand too, right?

<b>

Huh? Is it because Morris-sensei is a dwarf, so it's natural for him to have strength?

So what about that? I think that attitude towards a lady is rude!

<b>

According to Morris-sensei's explanation, this metal tube is a large custom-made magic power storage device that contains a special magic power battery.

To allow for a substantial amount of magic power to be stored, they used a lot of special materials, which made it quite heavy.

<b>

For a while now, I have been repeatedly performing the simple task of receiving this from the teacher, infusing it with magic power, and handing it to the part-timers.

<b>

<b>

"The 'Earth Awakening' was created based on this."

<b>

The cartridges infused with magic power that I handed over are being placed one after another into a square box resembling a four-tube rocket launcher.

That box is lined up on the ground and connected in parallel.

Morris-sensei said this while checking the connections between that box and other equipment laid out.

<b>

"This is used to investigate the presence of mineral veins sleeping deep underground. Well, using it effectively requires delicate magic power manipulation and ample experience."

<b>

Several cables extend from a stake-like sensor driven deep into the ground.

All those cables are connected to the equipment placed on the surface.

<b>

These stakes were driven in advance by the part-timers.

The surface equipment was brought by us in the carriage.

<b>

There are a dozen or so large carry cases, big enough for an adult to fit inside.

The cases are opened wide, displaying their contents neatly lined up in a row.

Inside, there are glass tubes, meters, dials, levers, and all sorts of mechanical items crammed in.

What they are used for… Honestly, I have no idea at all!

<b>

"And a tremendous amount of magic power! If we're to survey the entire mountain, the princess's extraordinary magic power is essential!!"

<b>

Once again, this teacher refers to people as non-human.

I really think these teachers have no consideration for me at all!

As Morris-sensei slides various equalizer-like switches on the device at hand, the gauge in front of him rises steadily.

<b>

"If you want to investigate this much area, normally, it would take one to two months for the survey! Yet, to prepare enough magic power to cover an entire mountain in just one day, or even in a little over an hour, is something only the princess can manage!"

<b>

Even if you say that…

<b>

Suddenly, I noticed that the world around us was starting to mix with a lot of red hues.

In this season, after 3 PM, evening comes quickly.

<b>

The carriage had arrived at the mine surprisingly early.

Initially, it was supposed to arrive after 4 PM, but in reality, we got there just after 2 PM.

<b>

Actually, after crossing the valley, we took a path through the mountain peaks, but Alma-san, who was holding the reins, was unusually excited and sped up tremendously… but I won't say anything about that now. What is safety, anyway…

<b>

Having unexpectedly gained some time, Morris-sensei said, "It looks like we can gather the mineral vein data from this mine before sunset," and immediately began working after our arrival.

<b>

<b>

This place, surrounded by mountains on all sides, will soon have the sun hiding behind the western mountain.

The sunset is approaching quickly. The mountains are gradually being set ablaze.

The village beyond the mountain to the east is said to be where Karen was born and raised.

I wonder if she used to see these burning mountains in the past.

<b>

The beautifully balanced, conical Koridona Mountain looms large, and along with the mountains at its base, they are all dyed red.

That sight is like a goddess quietly and sorrowfully spreading her burning arms, and it feels very divine.

Being here makes me feel as if I've stumbled into a hidden temple of the goddess of flames, evoking a strangely solemn feeling.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, the device began to emit a sound like "Vee, Vee," as if it were groaning.

It seems some time has passed while I was lost in thought about the surrounding mountains.

<b>

The part-timers are bustling around in a hurry.

Morris-sensei took a long strip of paper that was being ejected from the device, resembling tape.

The tape that keeps coming out has a series of tiny holes punched in it. It seems the teacher is reading the information measured by the device from the pattern of those holes.

<b>

After scanning the tape, the teacher looked up at us and said, "The results are in."

<b>

"Well, to put it bluntly… there are no mithril veins in this mountain. Not a single fragment!"

<b>

The teacher continued, "I had already figured that out."

<b>

"There are, of course, no gravisten veins either. Speaking only of this mountain, there is a 100% certainty that there are none. I can't say anything about the other mountains in Munanotos, but… at the very least, there is no mithril. That requires a special magic field. Unfortunately, even Seiwashi-kun's assessment indicated that there is no such flow of magic in Munanotos."

<b>

The gravisten vein was something Lawrence Niven believed to exist.

To obtain it, he brought up the non-existent mithril story… It's overly convoluted and completely nonsensical.

In any case, it seems such a rare mineral vein does not exist.

Originally, it was the former eldest son, Van Niven, who brought this story.

What on earth was his purpose in pulling such a stunt?

<b>

"Is there something you want to obtain from this place…?"

"Yes?"

<b>

"Nothing at all. More importantly, Su-chan, aren't you tired?"

"Oh, no, not particularly."

"What an utterly exasperating non-human demeanor."

"Morris-sensei? Could you please tone down the way you say that…"

<b>

"Listen! If you want to fill this magic cartridge completely, you'll need the magic power of fifty Seiwashi-kuns! What does that mean? A tube packed to the brink, about to burst, has already exceeded fifty! They're all on the verge of overflowing! And yet, the person using the magic still looks perfectly fine and claims not to be tired! What on earth is going on?! It's only natural to call that non-human, right?!"

"Ah—, ahaha—"

"Come on—Su-chan, you're such a tease♪"

<b>

Just as I was about to raise my voice in protest to Morris-sensei's constant "non-human" remarks, I was instead bombarded with a tremendous tirade.

I guess I can only laugh awkwardly to cover it up?!

Alma-san is poking my cheek as I awkwardly smile.

What is with this person—why do they look so happy—?!

<b>

In reality, my main job seems to have been to deliver the teacher to the mine and act as a sort of tank truck for infusing magic power into the cartridges.

Alma-san can handle the vigilance at the camp all by herself… Since I plan to return to the "field class" tomorrow.

Well, after the "field class" ends, I will rejoin here and take the teacher to Magnum Toru City.

Ah—, what a hectic time!

<b>

But I see. There are no expected mithril veins here.

Karen had hoped that mining would resume here someday.

That was the wish of her parents.

Karen wishes to carry on that will and revitalize Munanotos into the lively hometown it once was through mining.

<b>

The mithril mining project was a hope to fulfill that wish.

If the crucial mineral vein is absent, then the revival of the town is but a dream.

I wonder if the chairman had anticipated such results?

Thinking that I must convey this result to Karen makes me feel heavy-hearted.

<b>

"However, it seems this mountain has a strong reaction to 'tin.'"

"'Tin,' you say?"

"Yes. It is likely a tin ore deposit. The neighboring peaks probably have similar deposits as well. I can't say for certain without investigating, though!"

<b>

With that, Morris-sensei called out to the part-timers, "Starting tomorrow, we will investigate the southern mountain!"

<b>

"Tin is a relatively harmless and stable mineral. It's used as a bonding agent for certain divine tools and metals. Additionally, it's part of the materials for mana batteries as an alloy. Even in modern times, it is a mineral with sufficient demand."

"And so…"

"The development of this mine is possible. However, as you might understand, mineral resources are not infinite. I recommend establishing a long-term mining plan before starting."

<b>

With that, Morris-sensei turned his back to us to give instructions to the part-timers.

<b>

I couldn't help but let out a quiet sigh of relief.

Honestly, I had no idea what results this investigation would yield.

But it seems I can manage to give Karen a good report.

<b>

"That's great. Karen-chan will likely be pleased."

"Yes! Thank you very much, Alma-san."

<b>

Alma-san smiled gently and said that. It seems she cares quite a bit about Karen, which makes her happy.

<b>

<b>

For a while now, Alma-san has been sitting on a large carry case set on the ground. That case contains her own belongings.

While in that position, she reached into the pouch at her waist, took something out, and brought it close to her face, blowing a small breath on it.

Suddenly, the item in her palm was caught by the wind and floated up into the air.

<b>

"Speaking of which, Alma-san, you were scattering that around on the way here, weren't you?"

<b>

"What was it called again? 'Bohansen-sensor,' or something like that?"

<b>

As I said that, Alma-san blew another breath on one that remained in her hand. It floated gently on a slight breeze and reached me.

<b>

What reached me was a small medal made of a thin branch cut into a circle.

It had small feather-like tufts connected by thin threads, which danced in the air as they caught the wind.

<b>

"All of these are connected to me by magic power. If I scatter them over a wide area, they will immediately relay any happenings to me."

<b>

"Wow. How many have you scattered?"

"Well, I started scattering them after crossing the valley, so I think I've done about a hundred so far… After that, if I send them east and north-south from here, I believe I can cover a radius of 40 kilometers."

<b>

As she spoke, Alma-san reached into her pouch again and pulled out another handful of those items.

It seems her pouch is also spatially expanded. I wonder how large the expansion ratio is; it seems there’s still plenty inside.

Then she blew on them again, sending them back up into the sky.

<b>

Each of those items is infused with Alma-san's magic power, connected by magic lines, allowing for information sharing.

<b>

"I've only infused them with a weak magic power that will dissipate in two or three days."

<b>

Alma-san says that, but I think the detection range is quite impressive.

It easily surpasses my exploration range.

I can understand why she is called a master bouncer.

<b>

"If anything enters the range, you'll know immediately, right? Even if it's a dangerous opponent, you can respond through this, so you can rest easy."

<b>

"To grasp such a wide area and even respond… is that really possible?"

<b>

Alma-san says she can use magic on a target 40 kilometers away.

That’s far beyond the line of sight; it’s beyond the horizon. Is it really possible to manifest magic at such a distance?

I couldn't help but widen my eyes and ask about the scale of that extraordinary magic.

<b>

"If you can see what needs to be done, distance doesn't matter. That's what magic is about."

<b>

Alma-san says that as long as she can grasp the target, distance is irrelevant for using magic.

I understand that when using some kind of magic on a target, it’s necessary to firmly capture the other party in your consciousness.

However, when she says that distance doesn't matter, I can't help but tilt my head a bit.

Because magic has its effective range.

I can't think of any magic that can reach such long distances.

First of all, normally, you can't capture a target at such a long distance.

<b>

"It’s true that setting limits on phenomena makes it easier to grasp the image. But you see, once you fix the image, your world becomes fixed at that size. You can't go beyond that."

<b>

Saying that, Alma-san looked up.

<b>

Following her gaze, I looked up as well, and I noticed that the sun had already descended beyond the horizon, and the sky after sunset was dyed with a reddish hue, bordered by slender clouds.

The eastern side of the clouds was already tinged with dusk, and behind the scattered stars, the two overlapping moons appeared above the goddess's mountain.

The moonlight faintly illuminated its peak.

<b>

For a moment, I was captivated by the strangely divided sky.

As the twilight deepened and the stars twinkled brighter, the red moon became more prominent, hiding the blue moon behind it.

<b>

Alma-san, sitting on the carry case, reached out her hand as if to touch the distant red moon with her fingertips.

<b>

"As magic users, we can sit here like this and still touch that moon. Don't forget that."

<b>

What does it mean to touch the moon?

Is it about transcending distance and extending consciousness? To be able to influence something so far away…?

<b>

Before I knew it, I was also reaching my hand toward the moon. But what it means to touch it is still a bit unclear to me.

The edge of my hand, raised toward the sky, glimmered faintly with the moonlight hidden in my palm.

<b>

I noticed that Alma-san was gazing at me with a gentle smile, which made me feel a little embarrassed.

<b>

"Shall we start preparing dinner soon?"

<b>

Morris-sensei's voice could be heard from a distance, asking the part-timers, "Is the camp preparation finished?!"

The ingredients are said to be locally sourced from Munanotos, prepared by the part-timers at the camp.

Of course, I had also brought salt and herbs. I had intended to cook dinner myself from the beginning.

<b>

"Yes, I'll do my best."

"That sounds exciting♪"

<b>

The two of us descended from the mountain peak along the well-maintained path to the camp.

Tonight, I will do my best to make something delicious for Alma-san and the others.

When I meet Karen tomorrow, I hope to bring her a good story.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

The blue moon is overshadowed by the red moon.

The blue moon, now hidden, becomes even redder.

Waves of night winds carry thin clouds, flowing like waves across the red.

<b>

The moonlight shining brightly on the ground does not reach the darkness of the forest.

Shadows darker than the darkness reveal themselves cloaked in blue.

<b>

"…Now, let us raise a cup filled with despair."
