# 196 Under the Red Moon

People in work clothes were busily moving around us.

These people are said to be university students who had arrived at the site earlier. In short, they are student part-timers.

These part-timers had prepared the site in advance to facilitate surveying.

<blank>

Our wagon had arrived at the entrance to a sealed tunnel on the north side of the mine.

The part-timers were making a base camp for this exploration in the square in front of the tunnel, which is quite large.

<blank>

They had been preparing for a week, starting from this campsite, to clear the road to the survey point at the top of the mountain, and to clear the survey site.

I really appreciate your efforts.

<blank>

In case you are wondering, the magic used to create and clear this road was "bedrock road", which is an earth-based magic.

I heard it was used extensively in the reconstruction of Boltusunan.

My Bibi's specialty, "rock wall" or pushing up cobblestones, is a derivative of this magic.

<blank>

Bibi said that with this magic, she could make a path 15 to 6 meters wide, if it were instantaneous, and less than a meter wide. But at her age, it seems that she is not up to standard.

It is basic magic, but it has a very wide range of applications, such as leveling muddy or bumpy roads.

But the state of finish seems to vary a lot depending on the skill of the surgeon.

<blank>

Even so, I still think it was quite a difficult task to prepare such a large area of scaffolding.

This time, it will be my job to escort this survey site, including a total of 12 part-timers who have done this work for me.

<blank>

<blank>

And now I am being asked to play another role in my visit to this place, that is, to do something other than being an escort.

Dr. Morris says that this is actually his main job. ...... What the heck is that?

<blank>

That's the next cartridge.

<blank>

He hands the cylindrical object he has been holding in his hand to Mr. Byte and receives the next new cylinder from Dr. Morris.

What you are receiving is about the thickness of a 500-milliliter plastic bottle? It is a metal cylinder about 70 centimeters long.

The weight seems to be reasonable.

<blank>

The part-time worker who handed it to him was carrying it in a two-man team, yo-yo-yo-yo.

But I don't think you need to look at me with such horrified eyes, holding me with one hand.

Even Dr. Morris has one hand, right?

<blank>

Huh? Dr. Morris is a dwarf, so it's natural that he has strong arms?

That's why you're here. I think it's rude to behave that way toward a lady!

<blank>

Dr. Morris explained that this metal cylinder is a large special magic storage enclosure with a custom-made magic battery on it.

The weight of the device is said to be quite heavy because of the abundance of special materials used to fill it with a considerable amount of magical power.

<blank>

Since a while ago, I have been receiving these from the teacher, putting magic power into them, and handing them to the part-timer. I have been repeating this simple process dozens of times.

<blank>

<blank>

The "Earth Awakening" is based on this.

<blank>

The cartridges filled with magic power that I handed over to him were placed one after another in a square box that looked like a quadruple rocket launcher.

The boxes were placed side by side on the ground and connected in parallel.

Dr. Morris said this as he checked the connection between the box and the other equipment lined up.

<blank>

It is used to determine if there are veins of ore lying deep in the earth. It requires delicate manipulation of magic and more than enough experience to use it well.

<blank>

Several cords extend from a stake-like sensor driven deep into the ground.

All of those cords are connected to equipment placed on the ground.

<blank>

These stakes had been driven in by the bytes in advance.

The equipment on the ground was brought by us in horse-drawn wagons.

<blank>

There were more than a dozen large carrying case-like objects, each large enough to hold an adult.

The case is opened fully, and the contents are neatly laid out in a horizontal row.

The contents were all full of mechanical things, such as glass tubes, meters, dials, and levers! The contents were all filled with glass tubes, gauges, dials, levers, and other mechanical things.

I have no idea what it is used for ....... To be clear, I have no idea!

<blank>

And a huge amount of magic power! If this entire mountain is to be explored, the Princess must have a magical power beyond her own!

<blank>

Also, this teacher is calling people out of character.

I really don't think that these teachers have any reservations about me!

As Dr. Morris slides one after another the slide switches for the equalizers that line the device at hand, the gauges in front of him go up and down.

<blank>

If we were to use this equipment to investigate such a large area, it would normally take one to two months to complete the exploration! It would take only Hime-san to prepare enough magic power to cover a whole mountain in just an hour, let alone a day!

<blank>

That being said. ......

<blank>

Looking around, I noticed that the world was beginning to take on a very vermilion hue.

In this season, evening comes as soon as 3:00 p.m. rolls around.

<blank>

The wagons had arrived at the mine unexpectedly early.

Initially, we were supposed to arrive a little after 4:00 p.m., but in fact we arrived a little after 2:00 p.m.

<blank>

Actually, after crossing the canyon, we took the road through the peaks of the mountains, where Alma, who was holding the reins, was strangely agitated, thanks to the great speed she was going. ...... I won't say anything now. What is safety? ......

<blank>

With the unexpected extra time, Dr. Morris decided to begin work immediately after his arrival, saying, "I think I can get the vein data from this mine before nightfall.

<blank>

<blank>

Surrounded by mountains on all sides, the sun will hide behind the mountains to the west in not much longer.

The sun will soon be setting. The mountains are slowly burning.

We are told that the village beyond the mountains to the east is where Karen was born and raised.

I wonder if she too had seen these fiery mountains in the past.

<blank>

The beautifully balanced cone of Mt. Coridona rises high above the city, and the mountains at its foot are all tinged with red.

The figure is very divine, like a goddess quietly and wistfully spreading her burning arms.

Being here, one feels as if he or she has been transported into a temple of fire where the goddess is hidden, and one feels strangely austere.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suddenly, the device began to make some kind of roaring sound, like a "vee" or "vee" or "vee.

It seemed that a good amount of time had passed while I was thinking about the mountains around me.

<blank>

The part-timers rush around in a hurry.

Dr. Morris picked up a long, thin piece of paper that looked like tape being spit out of the device.

The tapes that come out one after another have regular holes drilled into them in fine detail. The teacher seems to be reading the information measured by the device by the pattern of the arrangement of the holes.

<blank>

The doctor must have gone through the tapes, and then he looked up at us and said, "The results are in.

<blank>

Well, let me conclude: ....... There is no vein of mithril in this mountain. Not a shred!"

<blank>

The doctor continued, "It was obvious, though.

<blank>

Of course there are no veins of gravistein. "Of course there are no veins of gravistene," he said, "and I'm 100 percent sure that there are none in this mountain alone. I can't say for sure about the other mountains in Munanotos until I check ......, but at least there's no mithril. That would require a special magic field. Unfortunately, even in your estimation, Sei Eagle said that there is no such a flow of magic in Munanotos."

<blank>

The gravistene vein is what Lawrence Niven thought he had.

To get it, he brought up a mithril story that doesn't exist. ...... It's a bit of a circle jerk and makes no sense at all.

Either way, it seems that such a rare vein does not exist.

He said that it was Van Niven, the former eldest son of the case, who originally brought this to his attention.

What in the world was he doing this for?

<blank>

"I wonder if there's something in this place you'd like to get your hands on: ......"

Yes?"

<blank>

Nothing. Anyway, Sue, are you tired?"

Uh, yes, not particularly.

He's a total fucking outcast."

Dr. Morris? Come on, just say it a little bit. ......"

<blank>

You know what? If you want to fill one of these magic cartridges to the brim, you'll need the magic power of fifty Seyashi-kuns! What does that mean? There are already more than fifty tubes filled to the brim, all of them on the verge of overflowing! They are all on the verge of overflowing! And yet, the person who used the magic power still looks unconcerned and says he is not tired! What in the world is going on here? No wonder they call me a crazy person like this!

"Ah--, ah, ah, ah ----"

"Oh, my God, Sue, you're so mischievous!"

<blank>

When I tried to protest to Dr. Morris that he should do something about the "outsider, outsider" comments, he was very forceful in his protests.

I had to laugh it off for the time being!

Alma-san poked me on the cheek as I forced myself to smile.

What is this guy - why does he look like he's having fun?

<blank>

I heard that really my rough job was mainly to deliver the doctor to the mine and to act like a tanker truck to fill the cartridges with magic power.

Alma is the only one who can do the vigil at the campsite, so please contact me at ....... Tomorrow I am going back to the "field class".

Well, after the "outdoor class" is over, we will already join here again and drive the teacher back to Magnumtor City.

Ahhhh, the rush!

<blank>

But I see. There is no expected vein of mithril here?

Karen hoped that eventually mining would resume here.

Because that's what your parents wanted.

Karen hopes to carry on that work and make Munanotos the mining and vibrant home it once was.

<blank>

The mithril mining business was the hope to fulfill that desire.

Without that vital vein of ore, the revival of the city is a pipe dream.

Did the Chancellor anticipate this kind of result?

It is sobering to think that I will have to tell Karen about these results.

<blank>

Still, there seems to be a strong reaction to the tin on this mountain."

"Tin, huh?"

Yes. It is probably a tin sand deposit. The neighboring peaks must be similar. I can't say for sure until I check it out!"

<blank>

As it was, Dr. Morris shouted to the bites around him, "Tomorrow we will survey the south side of the mountain!" he shouted to the part-timers around him.

<blank>

Tin is a relatively harmless and stable mineral. It is used in certain sacred objects and as a bonding agent between metals. It is also used as an alloy as part of the material for mana batteries. It is a mineral that is in great demand even today.

So...

I think it is possible to develop this mine. Although it is ......, as you know, mineral resources are not inexhaustible. I recommend that you start with a long-term mining plan.

<blank>

Mr. Morris turned his back on us to send instructions to the part-timers.

<blank>

I gently patted my chest.

To be honest, I had no idea what the results of this survey would be.

But now I will manage to give Karen a good report.

<blank>

I'm so happy for you. Karen will be very happy to hear that."

I see." Thank you, sir. Mr. Alma."

<blank>

Alma-san said so with a soft smile. Alma-san would be happy if she cared a lot about Karen.

<blank>

<blank>

From earlier, Alma is sitting on a large carrying case that she has propped up on the ground. That is the case containing his own luggage.

In that position, he reached into a pouch attached to his waist, took something out of it, put it in his palm, brought it close to his face, and blew on it with a small puff.

Suddenly, the object in the palm of his hand is swept up by the wind and rises into the sky like a flowing stream.

<blank>

I remember, on the way here, Alma was scattering it all over the place like that, right?"

<blank>

What was it called? Was it 'bo-bo han-sen-sa'? Something like that?"

<blank>

Alma then blew again on the one that remained in her hand. It was delivered to me with a slight breeze.

<blank>

It arrived as a small medal-like object made of a thin branch cut into a circle and a piece of wood.

It has small feathers like cotton wool connected to it by thin threads that catch the wind and make it fly in the air.

<blank>

All of this is connected to your sister by magic power. If you spread them out over a large area, if something happens, your sister will know immediately, okay?"

<blank>

"Wow. How much did you spray? How much did you spray, huh?"

Well, we started spreading them after we crossed the canyon, so we've only got about a hundred ...... so far. If we fly east, north and south from here, I think we can control a radius of 40 kilometers.

<blank>

With that said, Alma reached into a pouch attached to her waist and pulled out another handful of the item.

Alma's porch also seems to have been expanded in space after all. I wonder if the rate of expansion is quite large, or if it is still inside.

Then he breathes on it again and flies it up into the air again.

<blank>

Each one of them contains Alma's magic power, and they are connected to each other by a magic line, making it possible to share information.

<blank>

It's only got a little magic in it, though, enough to dissipate in a couple of days.

<blank>

Alma says so, but I think the search range itself is outrageous.

It is beyond my scope of search, isn't it?

No wonder he is called a great bouncer.

<blank>

I can tell as soon as something comes within range, okay? I can handle even dangerous opponents through this, so you don't have to worry about it."

<blank>

How is it possible for ...... to have such a broad grasp of the situation and respond to it?

<blank>

Alma says she will use her magic on targets as far as 40 kilometers away.

Not only is it completely out of sight, it is already beyond the horizon. How is it possible to manifest magic that far away?

I couldn't help but open my eyes and listen to the scale of the magic that was a bit out of that standard.

<blank>

If you know what you have to do, distance doesn't matter. That's what magic is all about, isn't it?"

<blank>

Alma says that as long as the target is captured, distance is not a factor in using magic.

Certainly, we know that when we use some kind of magic on a target, we need to first capture the person firmly in our consciousness.

But when people say it has nothing to do with distance, I tilt my head a bit.

Because even magic has a range.

I can't think of any magic that can fly that far away for a moment.

First of all, you can't capture such a distant object or something like that, usually.

<blank>

It is true that it is easier to grasp an image if you set a limit on the phenomenon, but once you fix the image, your world is fixed at that size. But if you fix an image, your world is fixed at that size. You can't go beyond that.

<blank>

Then Alma turned her face up.

<blank>

The sun had already set and the sky was bordered by long, thin clouds that seemed to block out the sky.

The eastern side of the clouds is already tinged with evening, and two overlapping moons reveal themselves above the mountain of the goddess, with the twinkling of scattered stars behind them.

The moonlight faintly illuminated its peak.

<blank>

For a while, I couldn't help but admire the mysterious sky that seemed to be split in two.

As the evening darkness increases and the stars shine more brightly, the blue moon lurks in the background and the red moon makes its presence known.

<blank>

Alma, sitting on the carrying case, reached out and made a gesture as if her fingertips were touching the red moon in that faraway sky.

<blank>

We who work magic can touch the moon even as we sit here. Don't forget that."

<blank>

What does it mean to touch the moon?

You mean flying consciousness over distance? That you can influence a place like that with ......?

<blank>

Before I knew it, I was reaching for the moon, too. But what it means to touch it is a little unclear to me now.

The edge of the hand held out to the sky was faintly lit by the light of the moon hidden in the palm.

<blank>

I noticed that Alma-san was smiling kindly and looking at me quietly. That makes me a little embarrassed.

<blank>

I think it's time to get ready for dinner."

<blank>

Dr. Morris asks the part-timers, "Are you finished getting ready for the encampment? and the voice they raise reaches here.

The food is said to be from the Munanotos region, prepared by the bytes, and is available at the campsite.

Of course, I had prepared salt and herbs. I had planned to cook dinner by myself from the beginning.

<blank>

Yes, sir, I'd like to show off my skills.

That's fun."

<blank>

The two of us descended from the top of the mountain to our campsite via a well-maintained road.

I'll do my best tonight and make something delicious for Alma and her family.

I will have a good souvenir to take with me when I meet with Karen tomorrow.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The blue moon is overlapped by the shade of the red moon.

The moon, filled with hidden blue, becomes more reddish.

The clouds, riding on the night wind, flow across the crimson like waves in the night breeze.

<blank>

The darkness of the forest is beyond the reach of the moonlight that shines brightly on the land.

Shadows darker than darkness appear clad in blue.

<blank>

......Then tonight, let us raise a cup filled with despair."
