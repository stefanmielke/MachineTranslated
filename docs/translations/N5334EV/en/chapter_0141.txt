# Chapter 129: How to Raise a Dull Lady

Cordelia Casper was troubled.

She was utterly at a loss about what to do next.

What troubled her was that she had no idea how to act from here on out.

<b>

This was a tea house called "The Big Front Yard," located in a shopping area just off Alfalfa Avenue, the main street of Dekkenbel.

<b>

"…Unplanned."

"Don't say that! Catherine!!"

"But, but! Just taking action like this is a tremendous progress, I think, Lady Cordelia."

"Is, is that so...? You're right, thank you, Lucille."

"Lucille, are you complimenting her?"

"！…L-Lucille?"

"N-No! That's not it?!"

<b>

The three of them were enjoying afternoon tea at "The Big Front Yard," with high-quality tea leaves and popular chiffon cake.

…Or so it seemed, but in reality, it was a bold plan by the young lady, who thought that since they were in the same class at the academy, they should be able to converse at work!

<b>

Normally, one would think that chatting during work would be out of the question.

However, the "Young Lady Quality" did not allow for such considerations.

Catherine, trying to point this out to Lucille, steered the conversation in a different direction, saying, "It's precious..."

<b>

In fact, every time Cordelia saw Karen Merlin, she would reach out to speak but would hesitate and pull her hand back, making a sorrowful expression, which Catherine quietly observed.

Watching this repeated scene, Catherine sipped her tea with a satisfied expression, murmuring "precious," while Lucille felt a slight headache coming on.

<b>

Lucille had recently been seriously considering that the young lady's clumsiness might largely be due to Catherine's steering of the situation.

<b>

<b>

That said, when Cordelia first opened the door to the shop with great enthusiasm, she was a bit taken aback to be greeted by Beatrice Croki.

<b>

The moment of slight silence that arose between the two truly felt like the air had solidified.

But soon, Miss Croki's dedication to customer service was commendable.

It would be nice if the young lady could possess this level of resilience as well.

<b>

Afterward, Miss Suzy Cloud happily welcomed the young lady, which was truly appreciated.

<b>

Miss Cloud then brought Karen Merlin over to introduce her, but the movements of the two were lacking.

Miss Cloud encouraged Karen Merlin to chat a bit more, but she quickly left the table, citing work.

Cordelia's expression immediately darkened, and Miss Cloud reassured her, "Once the customers settle down, I believe we'll have some time," and added, "I'll bring her back later," before returning to her duties.

Miss Cloud's consideration was genuinely appreciated by them at that moment.

<b>

Cordelia had likely completely lost sight of her original purpose by now.

Every time Karen Merlin passed by, her behavior showed no change, just a "…uh" or "um…" from the start, making it truly hopeless.

<b>

Do you understand, Lady Cordelia? Speaking up should be the initial step, right?

Lucille sighed softly as she recalled how Cordelia had spoken with a slight blush before arriving at the shop.

<b>

After chatting a bit and feeling that the distance had closed, you should promptly invite her to tea! Prepare plenty of her favorite tea and sweets, and enjoy chatting like old times!

<b>

Lucille was convinced that all those joyful plans Cordelia had been excitedly sharing had completely vanished from her mind now.

<b>

What on earth has happened?

She thought that her severe shyness had diminished compared to the past.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Excuse me. I will serve the tea."

<b>

The server who came was an elven waitress.

Seeing the beauty of the elf up close, Lucille couldn't help but take a small breath.

<b>

Of course, it wasn't her first time seeing an elf.

There were a few living in Boltsun, where they resided, so she had occasionally seen them.

Since coming to this city, she had seen them many times, as it was far more urban than her hometown.

There were elves among both students and teachers at the academy.

Elves generally have beautiful appearances, so they tend to catch the eye.

<b>

But this elven woman seemed particularly striking among them.

She couldn't articulate what exactly set her apart from other elves, but she was aware that her observational skills were still lacking, yet she couldn't take her eyes off her.

<b>

Pouring tea from the teapot into the cup, each of her casual movements struck Lucille as incredibly elegant and beautiful.

It felt as if particles of light were dancing only around her, evoking such a feeling.

<b>

Cordelia and Catherine must surely feel the same way.

Both of them were watching the elf serve with bated breath.

<b>

"Are you all friends of Suzy and Karen?"

<b>

The dreamy moment abruptly ended with her question.

Startled, they returned to their senses and somehow managed to respond.

<b>

"Y-Yes! That's right!"

"I see. I've had a few acquaintances of Suzy's visit, but it's my first time meeting friends of Karen's, so I couldn't help but feel delighted."

<b>

The waitress spoke with a slightly bashful smile, saying she wanted to see their faces up close while serving.

<b>

"Please be sure to get along with them. If there's ever a time when you need help, it would be reassuring to have your support."

"Of, of course! W-We are… f-friends after all!"

<b>

Seeing Cordelia respond strongly, albeit hesitantly, the waitress broke into a delighted smile and said, "Please take your time and enjoy yourselves," before gracefully leaving their table.
