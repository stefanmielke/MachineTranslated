# 129 How to Raise a Dull Lady

Cordilia Casper was in trouble.

I was utterly exhausted, wondering what to do from now on.

What is troubling me is that I have no idea what to do after this.

<blank>

This is a tea house named "Big Vestibule" located in a shopping area one street off Alfalfa Boulevard, the main street of De Kembel.

<blank>

"...... unplanned."

Don't say it! Catherine!

But..." "But..." "I think you are making great progress, Mr. Cordelia! I think you are making great progress just by taking action like this, Mr. Cordelia."

'So, so ......? Yes, that's right ......, thank you Lucille."

Lucille, is that a compliment?"

"! ...... Le, Lucille?"

It's different! No, sir!

<blank>

The three are now enjoying afternoon tea in the "big front yard" with fine tea leaves and popular chiffon cakes.

It looks like ......, but in fact, Karen Merlin, who is in the same class as me at the school but I can't have a proper conversation with her, would have a conversation with me at the office! The young lady's quick thinking led her to the idea that she would be able to talk to Karen Merlin at work.

<blank>

In the normal course of events, private conversation at work would be out of the question.

However, it is the "daughter quality" that fails to come to mind.

When Lucille tries to point this out, Catherine steers her in the direction of swimming by restraining her, saying, "Because you are precious .......

<blank>

In fact, every time she sees Karen Merlin, Catherine quietly watches Cordelia, who reaches out to speak to her but can't think of anything to say, and then returns her hand to make a wistful expression.

Lucille feels a light headache as she watches Catherine sip her tea with satisfaction, murmuring "precious" as she watches the situation repeated over and over again.

<blank>

I wonder if this clunkiness of the young lady is due in large part to Catherine's steering of the ship. Lucille has been thinking seriously about this recently.

<blank>

<blank>

Still, it was a little chilling to see that when Miss Cody first opened the door to the store with great enthusiasm, the person who greeted her was that Beatrice Kroki.

<blank>

The moment a slight silence arose between the two of them, I felt the air really harden.

Immediately, though, I thought it was quintessential that Miss Kuroki was committed to serving her customers.

I would like the young lady to have this level of strength.

<blank>

I was really thankful that Miss Susie Cloud was so happy to welcome the young lady afterwards.

<blank>

As it was, Miss Cloud had also brought Karen Merlin to greet us, but the key to the two of us was not moving.

Why don't we talk some more? Miss Cloud urged Karen Merlin, but she immediately left her seat because she was working.

When Miss Cody's expression suddenly sank, Miss Cloud said, "I think I can get some time off once the customers are done," and "I'll bring you back later," and went back to her work.

We really appreciate Miss Cloud who takes care of us now.

<blank>

At the earliest stage, Miss Cody must have lost sight of her original purpose in her mind.

I really can't help it, because every time Karen Merlin walks by, she says "......aa" or "that ......" and there is no change at all in her behavior from the beginning.

<blank>

Do you understand, Mr. Cordelia? Calling out to someone is the first step, isn't it?

With a small sigh, Lucille recalls Cordilia's arrival at the store, her cheeks slightly upturned as she spoke.

<blank>

When I feel that we have talked and become a little closer, I will invite her to a tea party! Then, I would prepare many of her favorite teas and sweets, and we would enjoy talking just like in the old days!

<blank>

Lucille is convinced that the events that she so gleefully talked about her plans are now clean out of Miss Cody's mind.

<blank>

What is going on at all?

These days, I thought I was no longer as terribly shy as I used to be.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Excuse me. Let me make you a cup of tea."

<blank>

The waiter was an elven waitress.

Seeing the beauty of the elf up close, Lucille couldn't help but take a small gasp.

<blank>

Of course, this is not the first time I have seen elves.

The girls had seen them from time to time, as they had settled in Boldsunan, where they lived, although only a small number of them lived there.

I have seen them many times in the city since I arrived here, probably because it is a much more urban area than my hometown.

There were elves in the academy, both students and teachers.

Originally, many elves are beautiful in appearance, so they are easy to spot.

<blank>

But this elf woman seems to stand out from the crowd of elves.

I can't put into words what makes them different from other elves, because I am aware that I am still a poor observer of people, but I can't take my eyes off of them.

<blank>

Pouring tea from the teapot into a cup. Lucille thought each casual gesture was very elegant and beautiful.

It is as if particles of light are dancing only there.

<blank>

I am sure Cordilia and Catherine feel the same way.

The two men also watched, breathless, as the elf served them.

<blank>

I wonder if you are friends with Sue and Karen?

<blank>

The dreamy moment comes to an abrupt end with a question from the person in question.

I rushed back to consciousness and managed to answer the question.

<blank>

Yes! Yes!"

I see. I know Sue and her friends have visited our store several times, but this was the first time Karen's friends had been here, so I was just happy to see them."

<blank>

The waitress told me with a slightly shy smile that she had come to serve me because she wanted to see my face up close.

<blank>

Please be a good friend to him. If you can help me in any way, that would be very reassuring."

Of course, of course! We are ...... friends!

<blank>

Seeing Cordelia's stuttering but strong reply, the waitress smiled happily, said, "Please make yourself at home," bowed neatly, and walked away from the three of them.
