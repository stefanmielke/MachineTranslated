# Chapter 186: Amukam Front

"Whoa!"

<b>

Burned by the heat of the flames, Irvin instinctively shielded his face with both arms.

But that heat wave was suddenly interrupted.

<b>

"Irvin! Are you okay?!"

<b>

William Cloud stood in front of Irvin, holding up his arm equipped with a round shield to block the encroaching heat of the flames.

<b>

"When slashing doesn't work, you just have to burn them!"

<b>

Karla, who had somehow appeared behind William and Irvin, casually remarked while watching the rising pillar of fire.

<b>

"You idiot Karla! This isn't Amukam! Didn't they say that was prohibited on the premises?! Have you forgotten how we broke the guardhouse during our sibling fight last summer and got scolded by Uncle and Aunt?!"

<b>

"No! Look, there's no building here!!"

<b>

"This is the consulate grounds, you idiot!!"

<b>

As Alicia and Karla were making a fuss, the pillar of fire that had been illuminating the surroundings gradually became thinner and lost its intensity.

However, when they recognized the figure standing within it, a sharp light ignited in the eyes of everyone present.

<b>

"Damn it! The fireproof barrier is no ordinary thing."

<b>

Ignoring Karla's frustrated mutter, the shadow that emerged from the pillar of flames coolly surveyed the area.

<b>

"Good grief... Do the people here fundamentally lack the concept of manners?"

<b>

Then, as if to brush off the soot on his shoulder, he lightly flicked his shoulder with his fingers.

<b>

"This place does not permit entry by outsiders. Shouldn't the one to be blamed be you, who intruded here without permission? Lord Van Niven."

<b>

"Oh? This is Lord William Cloud. How rude of you to say such a thing. I merely got lost, you know? This treatment towards a lost guestâ€”could this be the Amukam way?"

<b>

"What business did a lost person have in the office?"

<b>

"Well? Was I going there? But perhaps that was the result of getting lost."

<b>

"And as a result, you crushed the guards?"

<b>

"If sparks fall, one might have to defend themselves, right?"

<b>

While displaying a theatrical motion as if brushing off the soot clinging to his body, Van replied to Karla with a thin smile, "Just like now."

<b>

"But I won't let you forget about me. We just had fun playing earlier."

<b>

"I have no recollection of meeting anyone."

<b>

"Is it unfortunate that no one was there because you took care of everything? Too bad. The one you split in half earlier was a mere decoy. I'm still here, as you can see."

<b>

Karla had just fought with Van. And she spread her arms wide to show that she was completely unscathed.

<b>

"The guards have also been healed and revived by Jessica. I'm not the only witness who can confirm the intruder's presence."

<b>

"...It seems there is an unfortunate misunderstanding."

<b>

<b>

In response to Van, who continued to wear a calm expression despite the accusations, William stepped forward.

<b>

"I hope you understand that your excuses won't work. The ominous magical power emanating from you is certainly not human. Everyone here understands that."

<b>

"Good grief, even you treat me as a non-human? The people here are truly combative."

<b>

"Perhaps others might be able to deceive you, but unfortunately, this is Amukam. We have a certain connection to a kind of magical beast. No one here would overlook that."

<b>

Unbeknownst to them, on the wall behind Van, a figure holding a spear was poised like a large feline predator, gazing down at Van.

Additionally, a large man approached, wielding a massive battle axe in both hands, blocking the escape route.

And then, a sharp-eyed figure in a hood appeared from beyond the wall, playing with flames created in his hands.

<b>

"Everyone is gathering in response to the vile magical power you exude."

<b>

"Vile? That's quite an insult. The inability to understand this noble power only shows your limited perspective."

<b>

"These guys all seem to have inflated egos. That's quite typical."

<b>

Irvin snorted while keeping his sword pointed at Van.

And the person standing behind William infused his eyes behind his glasses with magical power, causing a tiny magic circle to appear there.

<b>

"'Early Vampire'... It seems you haven't been a vampire for long... But the distortion of this magical power is somewhat abnormal."

<b>

"What do you mean, Colin?"

<b>

"Spirit perception, huh... Quite presumptuous to spy. It's rather unpleasant."

<b>

"There's no doubt that you're low-tier as a magical beast. But..."

<b>

"I've already said it's unpleasant."

<b>

Van, who had been smiling faintly until then, frowned for the first time in displeasure and pointed his fingertip at Colin.

The nail at the tip of his finger turned into a black spear and lunged towards Colin.

However, William quickly deflected it with his round shield.

<b>

"You should stop your futile struggles. You won't escape easily from here. Besides, there was nothing you desired in the office from the start. You're already cornered."

<b>

"The office? Oh, that's fine. That was merely a performance."

<b>

"What do you mean?"

<b>

"It was a story that didn't matter from the beginning. ...More importantly, this place has an excellent view. I was looking for a location like this."

<b>

What is he talking about? William turned his gaze to where Van was looking.

<b>

This consulate, located in the old noble district, was built on the high ground of Dekember.

From the open courtyard, one could overlook the city, and the night view of Dekember was in full view.

<b>

Below, the gentle twinkling of streetlights spread as far as the eye could see.

But suddenly, a large light, different from the glow spilling from the windows, burst forth.

It was not just one, but two or three lights rising in succession.

<b>

"What the?! What is that?!!"

<b>

"It finally lit up."

<b>

With eyes that seemed to show joy at the long-awaited arrival, Van murmured, shaking his shoulders as if to suppress laughter.

<b>

"Could it be you?! What on earth did you do?!"

<b>

Hearing Van's murmur and seeing his demeanor, William glared at Van with sharp eyes, tightening his grip on his beloved longsword. He began to close the distance with a "creak" of his feet.

<b>

"Will!"

<b>

"What?! What's wrong, Karla?!"

<b>

William, not taking his eyes off Van, turned to Karla, who had suddenly called out.

<b>

"Undead are pouring out! They're overflowing from the graveyard one after another. The guards can't handle it anymore. It seems a request for the county knights has been made."

<b>

"What...?!"

<b>

As he instinctively looked towards Karla, a figure in black clothing was nearby.

So, it was someone from the Edgarra family. Their speed of information transmission was still astonishing.

<b>

"Was it your doing?! What on earth did you do?!!"

<b>

"Well?"

<b>

Despite William's strong questioning, Van maintained a thin smile and showed no signs of answering seriously.

<b>

"In any case, it seems I have nothing more to do here. Oh, by the way, I still have to clean up. I will take my leave now."

<b>

"I won't let you escape!!"

<b>

As Van politely bowed, Irvin closed the distance in one breath and swung his two-handed sword.

<b>

But suddenly, the shadow at Van's feet spread and erupted like an explosion.

<b>

"Ugh?!"

<b>

Just before Irvin was engulfed by the wave of shadows, he slashed it away with his two-handed sword.

<b>

"Axes Blow"

<b>

Further approaching shadows were struck down by Lombard, who activated the magical seal on his battle axe.

The shadow that received the magic-infused blow dissipated, vanishing as if melting into water.

<b>

"Shadow Ghoul?! Damn it! Even this?!"

<b>

William's shield, imbued with magical power, deflected multiple shadows that were closing in on Colin and William.

<b>

"Polearm Rapid Attack"

<b>

As the shadow ghouls were sent flying, Dana leaped from the top of the wall, launching a rapid series of thrusts with her spear.

The spear tip glowed with concentrated "Qi."

The body of the shadow ghoul struck by the light began to disappear as if a hole had opened where it was hit.

<b>

"High Slash Kick"

"Fire Release: Whirlwind Flame Slash"

<b>

Alicia blew away the shadow ghoul with a kick infused with "Qi."

Karla, with a short dagger held in reverse grip in both hands, surrounded it with flames and spun rapidly like a whirlwind, slashing the blown-away shadow ghoul.

<b>

Arrows created a magic circle in front of him and moved his hands to trace its edge.

<b>

"Small Flame Barrage"

<b>

Countless fireballs erupted with a loud noise, piercing through the shadow ghouls one after another.

The bodies hit by the fireballs were shredded like paper, and the shadows let out dying cries as they vanished.

<b>

On the cobblestone ground, the remnants of what had been shadow ghouls melted like flickering flames. Van's figure was nowhere to be found.

<b>

"Damn it! He escaped!!"

<b>

Irvin shouted regretfully as he slashed the remnants with his two-handed sword.

But he quickly closed his eyes and began to quietly sense the presence around him.

After a brief moment of meditation, he suddenly opened his eyes wide.

<b>

"Over there!"

<b>

Having found his target, Irvin immediately ran off in that direction.

<b>

"Wait, Irvin! Don't rush ahead alone!!"

<b>

"He probably headed to the hall. The distortion of magical power continues."

<b>

Colin floated a magic circle in his eyes and informed William of the direction of the distorted magical power.

<b>

"What will you do, Will? Should we all chase after him?"

<b>

Karla asked William.

She was inquiring whether to deal with the undead that had emerged in the city or to crush the likely source of it here.

<b>

"No, let's split into two groups. I'll leave the outside to Karla! Karla, use Edgarra's subordinates to deal with the undead."

<b>

William briefly contemplated and decided to assign Karla to handle the situation in the city.

Surely, those who are accurately grasping the situation happening in the city right now are not the guards or county knights, but the members of the Edgarra family.

Thus, it would be most efficient to have Karla, who serves as the command center, take charge on-site.

<b>

"Dana, you go too. Follow Karla's orders to stop and eliminate the undead."

<b>

"Honestly, I want to deal with that arrogant guy! But unfortunately, my weapon isn't suited for indoors. So, I guess I'll go out and cause a ruckus!"

<b>

"Arrows, Iâ€™ll leave the final processing of the undead to you. Can you handle it?"

<b>

"Undead... I'll turn them to ash from within!"

<b>

As Arrows snapped his fingers, numerous sparks of fire danced around his fingers, shining brightly for a moment before disappearing.

<b>

"Whew, that's scary..."

<b>

Karla instinctively took a step back at the density of the magical power contained in those tiny sparks.

<b>

"Lombard, you will guard Arrows. Of course, feel free to crush anything that comes into your sight."

<b>

"Leave it to me."

<b>

"Alicia, you will head to the hall with me. We're going to chase after Irvin!"

<b>

"Got it! This time, I'll blow his brains out for sure!"

<b>

Alicia clapped her gauntlets together with a "clap" and responded.

<b>

"The rest of you, to the hall. Colin, bring Jessica from the office. And Arrows, before heading to the city, call out to Victor and Willy in front and tell them to join us here."

<b>

Colin nodded, and Arrows followed suit, each showing their understanding of William's orders.

<b>

"Now! While it can't be denied that we've been a bit too lenient... Amukam is not that easy!"

<b>

At William's rallying cry, everyone echoed with a unified "Yeah!" 

And then, they all ran off in unison towards their respective destinations.
