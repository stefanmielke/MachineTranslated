# 186 Episode 186 The Amcam Front

Whoa!"

<blank>

Seared by the aftermath of the flames, Irving involuntarily shields his face with his arms.

But that heat wave was abruptly interrupted.

<blank>

Irving! Are you okay?

<blank>

William Cloud stood in front of Irving, holding up his round-shielded arm to block the heat of the onrushing flames.

<blank>

"If a slash doesn't work, you have to burn them!"

<blank>

Carla, who had been standing behind William and Irving before they knew it, looked out at the rising pillar of fire and blurted out something like that without a care in the world.

<blank>

'This, Obakara! This is not an amcam! You were told that those things are not allowed on the premises! Did you forget how your aunt and uncle beat you to a pulp last summer when you broke down the stuffing station in a fight?

<blank>

No, but there's no building here! But there's no building here!

<blank>

You're on consulate grounds! You idiot!

<blank>

While Alicia and Kara were fussing, the pillar of fire that had been shining brightly around them gradually thinned and lost its momentum.

But when they recognize a figure standing in the middle of it, a sharp light comes on again in the eyes of all those present.

<blank>

Damn! Fire barriers are not so bad."

<blank>

The shadow that emerged from the pillar of flame looked around coolly, taking aside Kara's regretful mutterings.

<blank>

Good grief ...... are these people fundamentally devoid of any concept of courtesy?"

<blank>

Then he lightly brushes the soot off his shoulders with his fingers, as if to remove it.

<blank>

This place does not allow outsiders to enter. The one who should be blamed is the one who entered this place without permission, isn't it? Mister Van Niven.

<blank>

Oh? This is William Cloud. You are being very rude again. I'm just lost, that's all. And this is how you treat a guest who is lost. Is this the Amkham way?

<blank>

What did the lost man have to do with the Oval Office?"

<blank>

Well?" Did he go to such a place? But I thought that was the result of being lost."

<blank>

"And then you destroyed the guards on guard duty as a result?"

<blank>

'If you're under fire, don't you sometimes have to defend yourself?'

<blank>

Just like now," Van, with a thin smile on his face, replies to Carla with an acting-like movement as if he is trying to get rid of soot that is clinging to his body.

<blank>

But don't tell me you've forgotten me. We had a good time together earlier.

<blank>

I don't remember seeing anyone?"

<blank>

"I've taken care of everything, so there's no one left that I've met? Too bad. That thing you just cut in half was a cicada. I'm still alive and well.

<blank>

Carla had just engaged in combat with Van. And she held out her hands to show that she was completely unharmed.

<blank>

The guards have been successfully revived by Jessica's healing. I'm not the only one who can identify the trespassers, am I?"

<blank>

...... Apparently, there's been an unfortunate miscommunication."

<blank>

<blank>

While Van still kept a cool face, saying he did not remember this, William took a step forward.

<blank>

I will not be able to get away with this. The evil magic that you radiate is not human in the least. Everyone here understands that.

<blank>

I am not a person," he said. These people really are belligerent.

<blank>

We may still be able to fool the others, but unfortunately, we are in Amkham. We have a bit of a history with certain demons. And there is no one here who would miss it.

<blank>

Before he knew it, on the wall behind Van, a spearman was poised like a large feline beast, looking at Van from above.

To further block his escape route, a large man approaches, holding a large battle-axe with both hands.

Then a sharp-eyed, hooded figure emerges from behind a wall, toying with the flames he has created in his hands.

<blank>

They are all gathered here in response to the fearless magic you wear.

<blank>

I'm sorry to hear that you are fearless. I think it shows the extent to which you are incapable of understanding this noble power.

<blank>

They all seem to be very self-conscious. That's a very typical thing to say."

<blank>

Irving sniffs as he says this, with the tip of his sword pointed at me.

And the person standing behind William had magic power in his eyes behind his glasses, making a tiny magic circle appear there.

<blank>

"'Arry Vampire' ............ doesn't look like he's been a vampire for very long ....... The way this magic is warped is a little freaky."

<blank>

What's going on, Colin?

<blank>

Is it a "spiritual quality view?" ....... You are very irreverent, peeping. I am more than a little uncomfortable."

<blank>

There's no question that I'm low on the demon scale. But ......"

<blank>

He said he finds every bit of it distasteful."

<blank>

Van, who had been smiling thinly, frowned uncomfortably for the first time and pointed his fingertips at Colin.

The fingertip claw becomes a black spear and closes in on Colin.

But William quickly played it off with his own round shield.

<blank>

You'd better stop trying to make a bad move," he said. You won't get out of here so easily. In the first place, there was nothing in the Oval Office that you wanted. It's already dead in the water.

<blank>

The Oval Office? Oh, that's okay. It was just a performance of sorts."

<blank>

What?"

<blank>

I'm just saying that it didn't really matter from the end." ...... more than that, this place has a really good view. This is the kind of place we were looking for."

<blank>

What are you talking about? and William turned to look at Van's eyes.

<blank>

This consulate, located in the old aristocratic district, was built on a hillside carved out of the De Kembel.

The view of the city from the open courtyard offered a panoramic view of De Kembel at night.

<blank>

Below, the gentle glimmer of city lights stretches as far as the eye can see.

However, as if to disturb the calm, a large light, different from the one leaking from the window, suddenly flashed.

Not one, but two or three, rose in rapid succession.

<blank>

What is it? What the hell is that?

<blank>

The light finally came on."

<blank>

His eyes showed joy, as if to say that what he had been waiting for had finally arrived, and Van muttered, shaking his shoulders as if trying to hold back laughter.

<blank>

"No way. You? What the hell did you do?

<blank>

William heard Van's muttering and saw it in his eyes. He glared at Van again with sharp eyes and put strength into his hand that gripped his beloved longsword. Then, he "zipped" his foot to close the gap between them.

<blank>

Will!"

<blank>

What? What's up, Kara?

<blank>

Without taking his eyes off the van, William asks what is going on when Kara suddenly calls out to him.

<blank>

The undead have sprung up! They're pouring out of the morgue one after another. The guards can't handle it anymore. The county knights have been called in.

<blank>

What ......?"

<blank>

I looked toward Kara and saw a black-clad man standing beside her.

So it is the hand of the Edgarra family. As usual, the speed of information transmission is tremendous.

<blank>

You did this to me? What the hell did you do?

<blank>

Well?"

<blank>

Even with William's strong question, Van does not seem to answer seriously with a thin smile on his face.

<blank>

Anyway, it looks like there's nothing more to do here. I haven't cleaned up the mess yet. I'll take my leave now.

<blank>

I'm not going to let you get away with that!"

<blank>

As Van condescendingly takes a bow, Irving closes the gap in a single breath and swings his two-handed sword.

<blank>

But the shadow at Van's feet suddenly widened and rose like an explosion.

<blank>

Gosh?

<blank>

Just before Irving is about to be swallowed by a wave of shadows, he slashes it away with his two-handed sword.

<blank>

Axe Blow."

<blank>

Lombardo, who had lit the magic marker on his equipment, struck the shadow that was further approaching Irving with his battleaxe.

The shadow, struck by a blow imbued with magical power, fizzles out and disappears as if dissolving in water.

<blank>

Shadow ghouls? Shit! All this stuff!"

<blank>

William's shield, cloaked in magic power, shot away several shadows that were closing in on Colin and William.

<blank>

Polearm Rapid Attack"

<blank>

As if to intercept the flying shadow ghoul, Dana leapt from the top of the wall and launched a series of high-speed spear thrusts.

The spear tip glows with converged "Ki".

The shadow ghoul's body, poked by the light, disappears as if a hole has opened from the area where it was poked.

<blank>

The High Thrash Kick.

Fugaku, Whirlwind Flame Slash

<blank>

Alicia blows away the shadow ghoul with a kick filled with Ki.

Cara, her dagger gripped in opposite hands with flames, spun around at high speed like a whirlwind and sliced through that blasted shadow ghoul.

<blank>

Arrows unfolds a magic circle in front of himself and moves his hand to trace its edges.

<blank>

The "Small Flame Rampant Bullet."

<blank>

Countless flaming bullets puncture the shadow ghouls one after another, making an explosive sound.

The body hit by the flame bullet is shredded like paper, and the shadow disappears with a final cry.

<blank>

The remnants of what used to be a shadow ghoul are melting, shimmering and twinkling on the cobblestones. Van is not there.

<blank>

He ran away! He's getting away!

<blank>

Irving shouted in frustration as he slashed away at the wreckage with his two-handed sword.

However, he immediately closes his eyes on the spot and quietly begins to search for signs of the area.

Then, after meditating slightly, he opened his eyes with a snap.

<blank>

Over there!

<blank>

Irving found his target and immediately ran from the scene.

<blank>

Wait, Irving, don't get ahead of yourself!

<blank>

"He's probably headed down the hall. There's a continuing distortion of the magic."

<blank>

Colin's eyes cast a magic circle and he tells William where the distorted magic is going.

<blank>

"What do we do, Will? Should we all go after him?"

<blank>

Kara asks William.

They are asking if we are going to deal with the undead that have sprung up all over the city, or if we are going to crush what we believe to be the source of the undead here.

<blank>

'No, let's split up. Kara will take the outside! Kara, use Edgarra's men and head over to deal with the undead."

<blank>

After a moment of thought, William decided to let Carla deal with the city center.

Perhaps it is not the guards or the group of knights who have an accurate grasp of what is happening in the city at the moment, in a wide area. It is the members of the Edgarra family.

If so, it is most efficient to have Kara, who is in charge of the command post, take the lead on site.

<blank>

Dana, you go, too. Kara's orders are to stall the undead and destroy them."

<blank>

If it were true, I'd like to take on that scruffy son of a bitch! I'm sorry, but my weapon is not suited for indoors. I'm going to have to go out there and get myself killed!"

<blank>

The Arrows will take care of the undead once and for all. Can you do it?"

<blank>

I'll turn the undead into ...... ashes from within their own bodies!"

<blank>

Arrows snaps his fingers, and several sparks of fire dance around his fingers, glowing white and fading away for a moment.

<blank>

Wow, ookane ......"

<blank>

The density of the magic contained in the small amount of fire dust is so intense that Kara is taken back by surprise.

<blank>

Lombardo is Arrows' bodyguard. Of course, feel free to smash anything you see.

<blank>

I got it.

<blank>

Alicia, you and I are going down the hall. We're going after Irving!"

<blank>

I'm going to blow his brains out this time! This time I'm gonna blow his brains out!"

<blank>

Alicia replied, "Gashiri!" and struck both cuirasses of her hands to answer back.

<blank>

The rest of you are in the hall. Colin, go get Jessica from the Oval Office. And Arrows. Before you go down into town, talk to Victor and Willie out front and tell them to join us.

<blank>

Colin's nod is followed by Arrows, each indicating their understanding of William's instructions.

<blank>

Come on! I can't deny that I'm getting a little too fond of ....... I'll show you that AmCam is not so naive!"

<blank>

Will's fiery voice echoed in unison, "Oh! and everyone's voices rang out in unison.

Then, they all started running toward their respective destinations at once.
