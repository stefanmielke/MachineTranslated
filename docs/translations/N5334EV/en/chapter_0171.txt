# Chapter 159: The Cute Firestarter (Mimi Shirex)

When Colin knocked on the door of the guest room and announced our arrival, a voice from inside urged us to enter.

<b>

"Please, come in!"

<b>

That distinctive voice must belong to Teacher Ursula.

Did she call for us? But why specifically to the guest room?

Moreover, Colin had said, "We have a guest."

<b>

As I pondered these things, the door opened from within.

To my surprise, it was none other than Anthony Reinberger, the student council president! I was taken aback!

The president greeted us with a refreshing smile, saying, "I've been waiting for you."

His dazzling aura as a handsome young man was blinding!

Wait, why is the student council president here too?!

<b>

The interior of the guest room resembled a salon.

The ceiling was divided into squares about a meter wide, each adorned with seasonal flowers.

The white wainscoting on the walls was intricately carved, and the carpet at our feet was richly colored, plush, and long-piled.

In the center was a large low table, and the long sofa placed there was spacious enough for all four of us to sit comfortably.

As always, the facilities at this academy are extravagantly luxurious!

<b>

On that long sofa sat a couple.

They appeared to be in their late thirties to forties, dressed in well-tailored clothes, exuding an air of refinement.

As we entered the room, the lady stood up energetically and spoke.

<b>

"Ah! There's no mistake! It's these people!"

"Anna, please calm down."

<b>

The man who stood up after the lady placed a hand on her shoulder, as if to soothe her.

<b>

"My wife has been rude. I am Joseph Barbara. We have come to express our gratitude for helping my wife."

<b>

Indeed, they were a couple.

The husband was Joseph Barbara.

His wife was Anna Barbara, who runs a boutique on Alfalfa Street.

It seems that their store, named "The Cute Firestarter," is a high-end shop that specializes in haute couture.

<b>

Upon hearing the store's name, Mia and Vivi exclaimed softly, "Oh!" Even Karen looked surprised, her eyes wide open. It's a famous store on Alfalfa Street that I've heard of as well.

<b>

The student council president was acquainted with the owners of that famous store, who also had dealings with his family, and had come to greet them as part of his guest duties.

Hmm, not only is he handsome, but he’s also a considerate man?

<b>

But, did we have any connection with such a famous store?

I've shopped in town a few times, but there's no way I could go to "The Cute Firestarter," a high-end store on Alfalfa Street, as a student.

<b>

What does "helped" even mean?

<b>

"This is the lady you all helped from an assailant in the alley last month."

<b>

Teacher Ursula, who was seated across from the couple, stood up and prompted us to sit on the sofa while explaining.

<b>

An assailant in the alley?

Ah! I remember that. When was it again?

Was it the day I first met the twins?

I ended up staying longer than I intended, and to take a shortcut to get to work, I entered the alley. There, I had repelled what seemed to be a street robbery...

<b>

"I wanted to come today to express my gratitude to all of you."

"Thanks to you, both Judy and I are safe and sound. Thank you so very much."

<b>

Judy is the sister who was knocked down by the assailant at that time. "I couldn't bring her today, but she is very grateful as well," Joseph said.

<b>

"Even though it was a terrible injury, she has completely recovered as if nothing happened, and she said it felt like all the fatigue from the all-nighter had vanished."

<b>

"The couple had been away from Deckenberg for a while, which delayed their confirmation of you."

<b>

Last month, there was a dress competition for next spring's collection in Granati, next to Karais.

In other words, it was a fashion show?

<b>

Mrs. Anna was busy finishing a dress for that show with seamstress Judy in a tailoring workshop in the city, working through the night.

After arranging to transport the dress from the workshop, she was attacked by robbers while heading to the store to prepare for departure.

<b>

Before their hurried departure, she informed the guards that she had been helped by students from Milia and asked the staff at the store to keep an eye out for her.

<b>

"I'm sorry it took so long to come and express my gratitude."

"No, it was the academy's circumstances that delayed the identification of you. I apologize for taking so long to arrange this meeting."

<b>

As Mr. Barbara bowed his head for the late gratitude, the student council president bowed his head to the couple, stating that the delay was due to the academy's circumstances.

The couple hurriedly urged him, "Please, lift your head."

I also stood up and said, "It’s not the president's fault!"

<b>

"Then, as a token of our gratitude, we would like to make dresses for all of you..."

<b>

As we both stood up, Mrs. Anna, who made eye contact with me, said that.

<b>

At those words, Vivi and I exchanged glances, then looked at Colin.

Colin was silently smiling.

I realized that this was what Colin had mentioned in the cafeteria, and exchanged another glance with Vivi.

<b>

"Just in time, we were in trouble because we didn't have a dress for this child for the party next week!"

"Oh my!"

<b>

When Vivi referred to Karen as "this child," Karen exclaimed, "Huh?!" in surprise, but I placed a hand on her shoulder, telling her to sit tight for now.

<b>

"Next weekend, huh... That’s fine! We have enough time to make it in time! Yes! Yes! Leave it to us! I believe Judy will be excited too. I take pride in saying she is the best seamstress in this country! If it's for the young lady, not only Judy but the entire staff will be mobilized to make it happen! Just leave it to us!"

<b>

I thought it might be a bit unreasonable to get it ready for the party next week.

I thought it would help if they could at least alter something ready-made, but the lady's enthusiasm was on another level.

<b>

Mr. Joseph, sitting next to her, nodded with a smile.

<b>

Haute couture dresses usually take more than a month to finish, right?

Wait, are they saying they can finish it in a week?

<b>

"Of course, we can't accept such an expensive thing!"

<b>

When Karen hurriedly raised her voice at the mention of haute couture being completed in such a short time, it was understandable given the high-end nature of the store.

However, the lady firmly insisted, "We will make it!"

<b>

"Indeed, we take pride in the quality of our products. They are not something we can sell cheaply. However, if it's a token of gratitude for helping my wife and Judy, that's a completely different matter. They could have lost their lives."

<b>

Mr. Barbara stated that the cost of tailoring was nothing compared to the lives of the two.

After such a statement, Karen hesitated a bit, but still shook her head, feeling it was beyond her means.

Well, it would indeed be quite an expensive item.

As a fellow commoner, I understood Karen's feelings well.

<b>

<b>

"Karen Merlin. Your humility is a virtue, and as a teacher at the academy, I feel proud of you. However, to simply disregard the goodwill directed towards you would mean rejecting their feelings as well, don’t you think?"

<b>

Teacher Ursula spoke to Karen with a smile, as if to advise her.

Though she looked like a young girl, she spoke with a nurturing warmth, carefully choosing her words.

At Teacher Ursula's words, Karen's expression softened slightly, as if she had realized something.

<b>

"What do you think? How about accepting the feelings of your counterpart?"

<b>

Perhaps something clicked for Karen at Teacher Ursula's words, as her previously stubborn expression softened a bit.

<b>

"Please, let us make it for you!"

<b>

The lady quickly took Karen's hand and squeezed it tightly.

She was quite assertive. Furthermore, she pressed on, "Please! Please!" while cornering Karen against the wall.

Karen, seemingly overwhelmed by the lady's passionate persuasion, leaned against the wall, her eyes wide open as she nodded involuntarily.

Yeah, it seemed a bit scary.

<b>

"Of course, we will also make dresses for all of you!"

<b>

The lady turned her face towards us, as if targeting her next prey (?). 

Oh, that’s a bit scary...
