# 159 Cute Flint (Mimi Silex)

When Colin knocked on the door of the guest room and announced that he had brought us, we heard a voice inside urging us to enter.

<blank>

Come in, come in.

<blank>

I wonder if this unique voice is Dr. Ursula.

Did the teacher call us? But why did he call us to the guest room?

And I believe Colin said he was "our guest".

<blank>

While I was thinking about this, the door was opened from inside.

The person who opened the door was, to my surprise, Anthony Reinberger, the student body president! I was surprised!

The student council president-sama comes to me with a cool smile and says, "I've been waiting for you.

Your fresh and handsome aura is dazzling, Konchikusho!

I mean, why even the student body president?

<blank>

The inside of the guest room was like a salon.

The ceiling is divided into squares of about one meter in size, and seasonal flowers are painted in these squares.

The white wall hips are finely carved, and the carpets underfoot are woven in colorful shades and are long and fluffy.

The low table placed in the center of the room is large, and the sofa set there is so large that there is still room for the four of us to sit side by side.

The school's facilities are as luxurious as ever!

<blank>

And on that horizontal sofa sat a pair of men and women.

They were in their late 30s or 40s. They were dressed in well-tailored clothes and looked like an elegant couple.

As we entered the room, the lady stood up and spoke.

<blank>

Oh! There is no doubt! It's these people!"

Anna, calm down."

<blank>

A man stands up after the lady and puts his hand on her shoulder as if he is trying to get her to accept him.

<blank>

'My wife begs your pardon. My name is Joseph Barbara. I am here to thank you for saving my wife."

<blank>

They were a couple, after all.

Her husband is Joseph Barbara.

His wife is Anna Barbara, who runs a boutique on Alfalfa Street.

I heard that it is a high-class store named "Cute Flint," where most of the items are tailored in haute couture.

<blank>

When Mia and Bibi heard the name of the restaurant, they said, "Oh! Mia and Bibi shouted in a small voice when they heard the name of the restaurant. Even Karen's eyes widened in surprise. Even I had heard of this famous store on Alfalfa Street.

<blank>

The student council president had met the owner and his wife of the famous restaurant, who also do business with his parents' family, and was greeting the guests as well.

Hmmm, a man who is not only handsome but also caring?

<blank>

But, have we ever had any connection with such a famous restaurant?

I've shopped in town a few times, but there is no way I could go to the "Cute Flint", an upscale store on Alfalfa Street, as a student with a quicksand.

<blank>

What's the big deal about 'helping'?

<blank>

This is the lady you rescued from the back alley thugs in the middle of last month.

<blank>

Dr. Ursula, who was sitting opposite the couple, stood up and motioned for us to sit on the couch.

<blank>

Back alley thugs?

Oh! I remember when that happened. When was that?

Is that it? The day you first met the twins?

I stayed longer than I thought I would and went into an alleyway to take a shortcut to work at the store. That's where I fought off what looked like a street robbery. ......

<blank>

I came here today to thank you all.

Thanks to you, Judy and I are safe and sound. Thank you so much.

<blank>

Judy is the sister who was beaten up by the thugs at that time. She couldn't be here today, but she is very grateful," Joseph said.

<blank>

He said, "I was badly injured, but I recovered as if nothing had happened, and even the all-night fatigue I had before seemed to have vanished cleanly."

<blank>

Mr. and Mrs. DeKembel were away from DeKembel for a while after that, so it took some time for us to confirm it was you guys."

<blank>

Last month, there was a dress fair in Granati, a neighboring province of Calais, for next spring's dresses.

In short, is it a fashion show?

<blank>

That day, Mrs. Anna had worked all night with her seamstress, Judy, at a tailoring workshop in the civic district, finishing a dress for that show.

Then, after making arrangements to transport the load from the workshop, he was on his way to the store to prepare for his departure when he was attacked by bandits.

<blank>

Before his hectic departure, he told the guard that he had been rescued by a student from Milia and asked the shopkeepers who were away to look for him.

<blank>

I am sorry it took me so long to come to you to thank you."

No, it was the school that took the trouble to identify these girls. We apologize for the time it took to identify them.

<blank>

When Mr. Barbara bowed his head to thank him for his delay, the student body president turned to the couple and said that it was only for the school's convenience that it took so long to identify them.

The couple hurriedly restrains him, saying, "Please lift up your heads.

I too stood up and said, "It is not the chairman's fault! and get up from my seat.

<blank>

So as a small token of our appreciation, we'd like to tailor a dress for you. ......

<blank>

We both stood up, and when our eyes met, Mrs. Anna said something like that.

<blank>

At these words, Bibi and I looked at each other and then at Colin.

Colin is silent and smiling.

I look at Bibi and the others again to see if this is what Colin was talking about in the cafeteria.

<blank>

I just had a party next week and was having trouble finding a dress for her!

Well!"

<blank>

When Bibi pointed out "this girl" by name, Karen was surprised and said, "What? Karen was surprised, but I put my hand on her shoulder and said, "Just sit down, okay? I put my hand on her shoulder.

<blank>

"Is it next weekend? ............. Yes, please! If you don't have time, we'll get it to you in time! Yes! Yes! Leave it to me! I'm sure Judy will be thrilled. She is the best seamstress in the country, I am proud to say! If it is for your daughter's sake, I will mobilize not only Judy but also all the staff in the store! Don and I are at your service!

<blank>

Is it reckless to make it in time for the quirky party next week? I thought so.

I think Bibi would have said it, thinking that it would be helpful if she could at least fix something that was ready-made, but Mrs. Koh's enthusiasm was far more vigorous than that.

<blank>

Her husband, Joseph, was standing next to her, smiling and nodding.

<blank>

Don't haute couture dresses take a month or more to finish?

Huh? You're saying you're going to finish that in a week?

<blank>

I can't take something that expensive!"

<blank>

Karen shouted in panic when she heard that haute couture was being finished, and in such a short period of time.

Well, you're right, haute couture in a high-end store is a bit of a scare.

But Mrs. Huang was adamant: "I'll tailor it for you! and she would not budge.

<blank>

We are proud to say that our products are of the highest quality. It's not something you can sell cheaply. But if it is in return for saving my wife and Judy, that is a different story altogether. If I had not, they would have lost their lives.

<blank>

Barbara said that the amount of money for tailoring is nothing compared to the lives of the two of you. The price of tailoring is nothing compared to the lives of these two people," she said.

Karen is a little hesitant to say so, but shakes her head and says that it is still appropriate for her.

Well, it must be a pretty expensive item.

As a fellow commoner, I understand Karen's feelings.

<blank>

<blank>

Karen Merlin. I am proud of your modesty, and as a teacher at the school, I am proud of you as well. But to simply reject the goodwill that is directed toward you, would you not also reject the feelings that are directed toward you?

<blank>

Dr. Ursula spoke to Karen smilingly and admonishing her.

She looks like a little girl, but she seems to have motherly feelings inside her and spells her words carefully.

Karen's face turns red as if something has just occurred to her.

<blank>

What do you think? How about you accept the other person's feelings?"

<blank>

Karen's stubborn face softened slightly, as if something in Ursula's words had occurred to her.

<blank>

Please, let me tailor it for you!"

<blank>

Mrs. Karen takes such a hand of Karen's and squeezes it quickly.

Mrs. Kohmoto was very pushy. She said, "By all means! By all means! and, holding her hand, she drove Karen up to the wall.

Karen, seemingly broken by the impassioned persuasion of Mrs. Cullen, nodded her head with her back against the wall and her hands clasped, her eyes wide open in an involuntary sort of way.

Oooh, you must have been scared somehow.

<blank>

Of course, we will tailor your dresses for you!"

<blank>

Mrs. Kosaka turned her head in our direction as if she was looking for her next prey (?) Mrs. Kosaka turned her head in a circle toward us as if she was looking for her next prey (?).

Oh, I knew it was a little coy. ......
