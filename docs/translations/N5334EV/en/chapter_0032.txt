# 32 Susie Cloud's First Time Running an errand

The life span of the dwarf was changed a bit.


----------------

<blank>

I'd like to run an errand for Susie tomorrow afternoon, how about ......?"

<blank>

Howard asked me for a favor while I was getting tea after dinner.

<blank>

Tomorrow? I have school, right?"

Henry said, "Well, this afternoon will be fine. I want you and Henry to go to Copetown.

With Dr. Henry, sir?"

Yes, Henry has an errand to the temple in Copetown. I want Susie to go with me to Copetown and pick up something for me.

<blank>

What is it? Does "together" mean that I'm accompanying the teacher?

<blank>

I would have given it to him myself,......, but tomorrow is a meeting I can't miss,....... But Marsh is leaving for King's Landing the day after tomorrow! I can't not receive it tomorrow!"

<blank>

Howard clenched his fists in frustration.

Sonia is giggling at that.

But I believe Mr. Marsh is the name of the blacksmith in Copetown. ......

Ah! I got a pinprick!

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's... a weapon, a sword was launched? My sword!

'Yes,' he said. Marsh says he's going to let the owner have it and adjust it for the final touches. We'll have to ask Susie to pick it up tomorrow."

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

<blank>

I was excited all at once!

<blank>

Equipped with leather armor that was made to order in the summer.

About a month ago, Mr. Howard asked a blacksmith in Copetown to make a counterpart to it.

The speed is unparalleled, with a normal order and delivery of two swords in one month!

<blank>

<blank>

Mr. Marsh is the head of the workshop that makes and maintains the weapons and armor used by the Amkamu Protectorate in Amkamu County.

The person who created the work was said to have done so by hand.

I must receive this in person and express my gratitude!

<blank>

"Well, go ahead ......, I'm sorry I wanted to hand it over to Susie myself ......!"

Oh, Howard, you don't have to repeat yourself so many times.

<blank>

Sonia is smiling colossally.

I got out of my chair and walked over to Howard's side and took his hand, looking up into his kind eyes as he looked at me. ......

<blank>

I'm so happy that Howard gave me a gift ... I'm a very lucky man.

<blank>

With that, I clasped Howard's large hand in both of mine and expressed my gratitude.

Mr. Howard said, "Really? He smiled and said, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

<blank>

I think this may be the first time ...... I've ever seen my uncle with such a loose look in the corner of his eyes."

<blank>

What are you talking about, Will?

Mr. Howard always answers with such a kind smile, you know? It's not unusual, you know?

<blank>

'Hmph, Howard can't help but think Suzy is adorable.

<blank>

Such embarrassing words from Sonia. It's quintessential Suzy .......　Will muttered.

Was that a compliment?

<blank>

So you're saying Susie can't come to the training center tomorrow?

"Yes, Will, take care of everyone, will you?"

I'll take care of it! Let's give Dana, in particular, some guidance like a top student ......, and keep it tight!"

<blank>

Will muttered the last part, squinting and looking a bit far away.

Oh, Dana, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure you got what you deserved.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Hello Suzy. Nice to meet you today."

Hello Dr. Henry. It's nice to meet you too.

<blank>

Shortly before lunchtime ended, Mr. Henry picked me up from school in his carriage.

Dr. Henry's carriage was completely different from ours, which was pitch black, pure white, and massive with fine gold work.

The quintessential temple chariot! Or something like that?

<blank>

According to Dr. Henry's story, it was a votive offering from some rich former nobleman.

To me, it feels like just an empty expense," says the doctor.

<blank>

It's a white horse that pulls it ...... white horse, or is it a horse? I still can't help but think it looks like a lizard.

Even though he looks like a lizard, our Regulus seems to have taken to me, and he's getting cuter and cuter these days. ......, well! White Horse, in.

<blank>

But wouldn't this white horse and white carriage be picturesque if used for a wedding or something?

I asked him about it and he said he has been using ...... for a long time! Sasuga desu!

<blank>

For some reason, I was a bit excited inside to be seated in such a white carriage used for weddings.

<blank>

I was wearing a young grass colored skirt today, but if it had been a white dress or something, I would have been more excited!

Then I will be allowed to spend the ride to Copetown, well-behaved, next to Dr. Henry, with my usual pigtails and white straw hat on my head.

<blank>

So, the teacher decided to continue with the magic lecture anyway.

<blank>

<blank>

This time he is talking about the next realm of "astral body" and "mental body".

<blank>

Zachary says that beyond the "mental body" is the realm of the "soul.

The soul is a vessel called a "Causal Body" that contains the "superconsciousness" or "superego," a realm that humans cannot perceive and do not understand.

<blank>

This "Causal Body" is called the "Thinking Body" or the "Causal Body," and it is said that the repeated memories of previous lives grow and grow like annual rings, indicating and determining the direction of a person's will.

<blank>

Therefore, the size of the "Causal Body" is the size of the "Soul" as it is.

The area that combines the "mental body" and the "Causal body" is called the "manas" or "psychic body," and the size of this "manas" is proportional to the size of the magical power.

It is said that ...... is a common practice in modern magical studies.

<blank>

<blank>

You're right, I don't know better when it comes to the story so far.

It doesn't ring a bell when people say "soul" or something like that!

<blank>

He also told me that I only needed to know a little bit about it.

He said that from this point on, it's already something to study at a university or something!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

But, you know, he also told me some things that I was curious about.

<blank>

It is said that there are also demonic beasts or "demons" that feed on people's emotions by inflaming them and making them grow larger.

<blank>

It's an 'emotion,' or 'astral body.

He said that the "astral body" is taken in by making the emotions bigger by fueling them with "pain", "fear", "anger", and so on.

<blank>

<blank>

"Vampires...you mean?"

<blank>

Dr. Henry jerked and said quietly, "Did you know about ......?

<blank>

Vampires are an abomination. They do not limit themselves to the astral body, but they also invade parts of the manas, taking it as part of their own magical power. Their victims are trapped in a part of their souls and will be out of the circle of reincarnation until the time of their destruction. ......

<blank>

When the manas is eroded and damaged, the connection between the physical body and the etheric body is weakened and severed, and the body eventually dies.

It is said that there is a "revival magic" that restores the connection between the body and the etheric body, but the success rate is extremely low, and as long as there are those who have eroded the "manas," it is meaningless.

<blank>

I felt a bit of a chill on the top of my head.

They are the ones who made Sonia Mama so sad!

If the doctor is right, Mr. Ravi still hasn't been saved!

In my mind, those guys became my top priority for eradication.

<blank>

<blank>

But ...... is bad.

It's a little peppier and darker. ......

Oh shit, this is awkward!

I'm sure people will think I'm a strange girl to suddenly smile here, so what can I do? ......

If you think about it.

<blank>

"Miss Susie, Daisy gave me something to take with me on the road.

<blank>

I reached into the back of the truck, picked it up, and opened it on my lap.

And then, out of the inside, what do you see? An apple pie like a rose came out from inside!

<blank>

Woohoo!"

<blank>

I couldn't help but exclaim in admiration!

<blank>

Thinly sliced apples are rolled up like rose petals and baked in a small cup-shaped dough!

It's so cute and beautiful!

<blank>

Daisy baked it this morning for Susie.

<blank>

Dr. Henry said with a smile.

Dr. Daisy, yeah! You are too nice!

<blank>

All at once, the heavy air that had been there earlier flew away!

We spent the rest of the road trip very happily, indulging in the luscious apple pie.

Thank you! Dr. Daisy!

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Copetown is a city spread out in a grid pattern with the stagecoach stop at the center and the street to Dekenbel as the main street ...... boulevard.

The workshop I am aiming for is located on a street just two streets back from the main road.

<blank>

The temple to which Dr. Henry is headed is on the other side of the main street.

He told me to wait at the workshop as his business would be finished in about an hour. He dropped me off on the main street and we went to our respective destinations.

<blank>

<blank>

The workshop was a brick building with an anvil and hammer openwork mounted above the entrance.

Duh! It's a blacksmith sign!

<blank>

You open the door and walk in, and immediately there is a counter with desks lined up in it, and a lady? A lady or a young lady? One of them, a young lady, was doing some office work.

I thought it was something like a post office or a bank counter.

<blank>

I told her my name and Howard's name, and told her how I wanted to see her. She asked me to wait a moment and then went through a door at the back of the room to the other side.

<blank>

When I opened the door, I could hear the smell of iron dust and burning steel, the sound of metal being pounded and metal being ground by a grinder.

Yeah, the counter looks like a bank, but the back is definitely a blacksmithing workshop.

<blank>

Soon after, the young lady from earlier returned, saying, "Sorry to keep you waiting.

Shortly thereafter, a red-faced, muscular old man with a stocky build and a long beard covering his face walked into the office.

<blank>

I'm Marsh Cowsbert, head of the workshop.

<blank>

He was introduced to the young lady.

As Grandpa left the counter and came out this side.

<blank>

I'm Susie Cloud. Nice to meet you.

<blank>

and ask for a handshake at .......

<blank>

"......mm"

<blank>

He responded to the handshake with a short word.

But even though they look me up and down like a stinker, they don't make eye contact with me.

Is he a difficult craftsman?

...... Huh? But could this person be ......?

<blank>

Mr. Dwarf, is it?"

<blank>

With a twitch, Mr. Marsh's eyebrows rose.

<blank>

What's the matter? Is this your first time seeing a dwarf, young lady?"

<blank>

The lady from behind the counter, propped up on her elbow and looking amused, asked me, "What are you doing here?

<blank>

"I knew it. You're a dwarf, aren't you? I've never met you before."

'Your daughter was from the village of Amkam, wasn't she? Is it too much to ask, since there are no dwarves in Amkam right now?"

<blank>

According to this young lady's story, no dwarves have lived in Amkam village for years.

Did they think I was a country bumpkin?

<blank>

I'm actually a dwarf myself. Do you understand?"

"Ho hee hee?

<blank>

I felt like I had a bit of a gap.

They appear to be 15-6 years old.

If this were a young girl, I might have been able to pin it on a set of grandpa dwarves. ......, I knew it was somewhat different from the dwarves I know.

<blank>

<blank>

Mr. Marsh told me to wait a little longer and went back inside the counter.

Then the lady behind the counter came over to talk to me about things.

When we spoke with her, she told us that this young lady is 28 years old and says she is Mariebelle, Marsh's daughter.

You were the sister, not the daughter. ......

<blank>

Dwarves are said to have a life expectancy of over 130 to 150 years, and Marsh is now 90 years old. Marsh is 90 years old now, and he is a very active dwarf.

And Mariebelle's 28 years old is still like a child, she says.

Dwarf women start growing beards around the age of 50, and by the time they reach 60, they have beards just like men, and are finally recognized as full-fledged, and from there they are of marriageable age. ......

<blank>

...... ah. I'm sorry about something.

For me, the story was a bit heavy on stimulation and a whirlwind of shocks. ......

It's still different!

It's not the world I know!

I'm so glad I'm a Dowa girl and not metastasized! I'm so glad she didn't metastasize. ......

<blank>

<blank>

While we were talking, Mr. Marsh took items from the safe-like shelves in the office and laid them out one after another on the counter.

The objects lined up were two swords in their sheaths and a sword belt.

<blank>

"I didn't think it belonged to such a petite girl. ...... The first time I saw it, I thought it would be a good idea to get a new one. I don't think I could handle two of them. ......

<blank>

He said this while wrinkling his brow and circling the counter.

When he came up to me, he took a sword in its scabbard on the counter and held it out to me.

<blank>

When I lightly accepted the sword, Marsh-san's eyes widened in surprise, as if she had not expected it to be so easy to hold.

<blank>

<blank>

Quickly pull it out and check the balance.

Oooh, it's a little light but feels good to hold.

<blank>

I gave it a little light shake.

Hu-huun, check how it swings with the wind.

Not bad.

I put it in the sheath like throwing it in.

Slip and fit is good. The sheath is nice.

<blank>

Pull it out again and stand the sword blade up in front of you and look at it closely.

I thought it was a beautiful, silvery white sword.

The double-edged blade is about 70 cm long. It is an easy-to-use length for me.

The blade width is about 7-8 cm.

There is not much decoration, but there is an Aurora inscription on the belly of the blade.

<blank>

Is it "Never hold a sword without reason, never wield a sword without virtue? Without virtue, you do not wield the sword."

"......Naturally, it's not what it looks like, as you say. ...... That's Mr. Howard's motto, I hear."

<blank>

Mr. Marsh, who had been wide-eyed and stunned, told me.

He pulled out another one and showed it to me, saying, "There is a carving on this one, too.

<blank>

It is Mr. Howard's wish that "My daughter with my pledge to her. Take it well."

<blank>

He said so and gave me a second bottle.

<blank>

...Yes... thank you... thank you...!"

<blank>

Howard says she's his daughter, too. ......

This is a surprise ...... cheat.

I can't help but feel choked up.

He held the two swords in their sheaths tightly to his chest.

<blank>

I'm sorry, sweetheart, did I get you all sentimental? Take some time to rest, get settled in, and we'll finish what we came here to do."

<blank>

I meditate and breathe, leaving only the warmth of Howard Papa to calm my mind.

<blank>

I'm sorry, I'm... I'm fine now. What are you going to do?"

<blank>

Mr. Marsh seemed impressed to see my immediate self-control.

<blank>

It's not difficult. All you have to do is to put your magic power into the sword. You've done it before, haven't you?

"Yes, how much should I cage?"

"Hmm? Well, you can cage me as much as you want, okay?"

All right, I'll... I'll start.

<blank>

I don't know how much magic power this sword can hold, so I'm going to try to put a little bit into it to see how it does.

<blank>

Hmm? Did you feel a little resistance when you first caged it?

But soon the resistance decreased little by little, as if the tube was expanding.

<blank>

I was afraid to go in there, so it might have taken a little longer.

After about a minute of pouring it in, it was like the sword was roughly full of magic.

<blank>

Hmmm, in terms of offensive power, it is mid-range of zero rank. It is about the same level as Mr. Howard's longsword.

But is the magic power near the top of the zero rank?

If anything, it is positioned as a magic weapon.

<blank>

Hey, hey, what the hell is ......!"

<blank>

Mr. Marsh is kind of peeling his eyes out...hmm?

<blank>

"Wait a minute, just keep it up! Can you hold it and wait?

Oh, yes, I'm fine, okay?"

<blank>

Mr. Marsh walked into the counter as if in a panic, retrieved some tools from a shelf, and returned.

<blank>

Stay that way for a minute."

<blank>

and goes to attach something to the handle head of the handle I am holding.

As it is, it seems to be adjusting something about the tool.

<blank>

I'm surprised. What's this? Is it beyond the measurement of the meter? Did this sword have this much magic power capacity?

<blank>

Mr. Marsh will accept the sword from me and send it to .......

<blank>

Wait here for a while, I'm going to put the "magic burn" right away!

<blank>

He then hurriedly entered the workshop.

<blank>

Sorry, I'll make you some tea now."

<blank>

Maribel said and came out from behind the counter.

<blank>

But it's amazing, I could tell from the other side. I've never seen a sword that can hold so much magic.

<blank>

Sitting across from me on the reception couch on this side of the counter, Mariebelle explained as we sipped tea.

<blank>

The sword is said to have mithril silver woven into it so that it can easily hold magic power.

It takes a lot of skill to keep the strength of the mithril alloy, and it is said to be a well-kept secret.

<blank>

The two dwarves were able to see the sword filled with magic power.

It is an eye that any blacksmith can see the condition of iron by looking at its burnt color, just as any dwarf who strikes weapons that handle magic power should have it.

<blank>

What Mr. Marsh is doing now is called "magic burning," in which the magic of the person using the sword is fixed in the sword, and the mithril inside the sword remembers the user's magic power.

This allows the user to use magic more efficiently when using the weapon.

<blank>

It is said that the user puts magic power into the "raw" mithril woven into the sword and uses a technique called "magic burning" in that state.

But that, too, is a "secret," he said!

<blank>

So, it seems that the magic power I just caged in has filled up a much larger amount than Mr. Marsh had expected.

Maribel said she was afraid that the water would overflow at any moment.

So Mr. Marsh rushed to the workshop with the sword.

<blank>

I bowed my head and said, "I'm sorry about that." He smiled and said, "It's nothing to worry about.

<blank>

<blank>

While we were talking about this, Mr. Marsh came back from the workshop.

<blank>

"Can you put the magic back into it again?"

<blank>

I took both swords and pulled them out of their sheaths, gripped them lightly, and held them so that they hung down on both sides.

As it is, try to pour magic power into both swords.

<blank>

Huh? I'm going in smoothly without any resistance like before.

Do you feel like there's more magic going into it?

This could have a magic attack value on par with a lower D-rank weapon.

<blank>

<blank>

What a magic caper ......, when did I ever build a high-grade product?

<blank>

Mr. Marsh is looking at us as if he is the most disgusted of all.

I was dripping a little sweat. ......

I really wanted to try injecting "Ki" into the ......, but I think I'd better not do that here.

<blank>

<blank>

I then put on the sword belt along with the sword.

After adjusting to the length around the waist, the buckle is simply snapped into place, making it easy to put on and take off.

<blank>

An o-ring is attached to the back waist area, from which four belts extend in an X shape.

The top two belts go around the waist.

The bottom two swords each have a sword holster to hold the sword in its scabbard.

The position and orientation of this holster is quite flexible, making it easy to use.

<blank>

I put on the sword belt, pulled out the sword as it was, swung it, and put it back in its scabbard several times to see how it felt to use it.

Duh! Something cool and pleasant!

<blank>

"......Hmmm, what about that flouncy skirt with the sword hanging from her waist ......? It's a little bit too much, don't you think?"

What?

<blank>

Does Marsh's assessment make you sweat a little?

I wonder if it means hashtanai? I wonder if it means "hashtanai"?

<blank>

Oh, my God! Dad, you're so hard-headed! That mismatch is cool! You're pretty in your own way, sweetheart!"

<blank>

Thank goodness! High praise for Maribel.

Marsh seemed unconvinced, but Mariebelle and I looked at each other and laughed.　But Mariebelle and I looked at each other and laughed.

The wind blows from the north.

Next "Late Afternoon at AMCAM
