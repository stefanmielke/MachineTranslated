# Episode 32: Suzy Cloud's First Errand

I slightly changed the lifespan of dwarves.

----------------

<b>

"Tomorrow during the day, I would like to ask Suzy to run an errand... what do you think?"

<b>

I was asked for a favor while having tea after dinner with Mr. Howard.

<b>

"Tomorrow, you say? But I have school, you know?"

"Yes, it will be fine in the afternoon. I want you to go with Henry to Cooptown."

"With Mr. Henry, you mean?"

"Yes, Henry has business at the temple in Cooptown. I want Suzy to accompany him and retrieve something."

<b>

I wonder what it could be? Does that mean I will be accompanying the teacher?

<b>

"…Originally, I wanted to hand it over myself, but… I have an unavoidable meeting tomorrow. However, Marsh is heading to the royal capital the day after tomorrow! I can't let it go unreceived tomorrow!"

<b>

Mr. Howard clenched his fist in frustration.

Sonia saw that and chuckled.

But Marsh's name was definitely that of the blacksmith in Cooptown...

Ah! It just clicked!!

<b>

"Could it be... that the weapon, the sword, has been completed?! For me!"

"Yes. Marsh said that for the final adjustments, it should be held by its owner. So, Suzy will have to go and receive it tomorrow."

<b>

<b>

"I'm going! I'm going! I will go!"

<b>

My excitement shot up instantly!

<b>

The leather armor I had tailored for summer.

About a month ago, Mr. Howard asked the blacksmith in Cooptown to make a pair of swords to match it.

Ordering normally, and having two swords delivered in a month is an incredible speed!

<b>

<b>

Mr. Marsh is the master of the workshop that handles the production and maintenance of weapons and armor for the Amkam Volunteer Corps in Amkam County.

He personally worked on the creation of these swords.

I absolutely must receive them directly and express my gratitude!

<b>

"Is that so? Will you go then...? I truly wished to hand it over to Suzy myself... it is quite regrettable!"

"Come on, Mr. Howard, you don't have to repeat that so many times."

<b>

Sonia laughed heartily.

I got down from my chair, went over to Mr. Howard, took his hand, and looked up at him with gentle eyes...

<b>

"I'm happy just to receive a gift from Mr. Howard... I am a lucky person."

<b>

Saying that, I tightly grasped Mr. Howard's large hand and conveyed my feelings of gratitude.

Mr. Howard smiled and nodded, pleased.

<b>

"…This may be the first time I've seen my uncle with such softened eyes..."

<b>

What are you talking about, Will?!

Mr. Howard always responds with such a kind smile, you know? It's not unusual!

<b>

"Hehehe, Howard can't help but find Suzy adorable."

<b>

At Sonia's embarrassing words, Will murmured, "As expected of Suzy..."

Was that a compliment?

<b>

"Then, it means Suzy won't be able to come to the training ground tomorrow, right?"

"Yes, Will, please take care of everyone, okay?"

"Ah, leave it to me! Especially for Dana, I will give her the best guidance... firmly!"

<b>

Will said the last part with narrowed eyes, looking a bit far away.

Ah, poor Dana. She brought it upon herself, though.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hello, Suzy. Thank you for today."

"Hello, Mr. Henry. Thank you for having me."

<b>

Just before the lunch break ended, Mr. Henry came to pick me up in a carriage.

Mr. Henry's carriage was completely different from our pitch-black one; it was pure white with intricate golden decorations, giving it a heavy appearance.

As expected of a temple carriage! 

<b>

According to Mr. Henry, it seems to be a donation from some wealthy former noble.

He said it feels like a mere waste to him.

<b>

It is drawn by a white horse... a white horse, right? It still looks like a lizard to me.

Even if it looks like a lizard, our Regulus seems to have warmed up to me, and has become quite cute recently... well! It's a white horse.

<b>

But this white horse and white carriage would look great for a wedding, wouldn't they?

When I asked about that... it turns out they have been used for that purpose long ago! Impressive!!

<b>

I couldn't help but feel a bit excited inside while seated in such a wedding carriage.

<b>

Today I wore a grass-green skirt, but I might have felt even more excited if I had worn a white dress!

And, with my usual pig tails and a white straw hat on my head, I thought I would behave well during the journey to Cooptown next to Mr. Henry.

<b>

Since we were on the road anyway, Mr. Henry decided to continue the magic lecture.

<b>

<b>

This time, it seems to be a discussion about the next realm after the "Astral Body" and "Mental Body."

<b>

To put it simply, the realm beyond the "Mental Body" is said to be the realm of the "Soul."

It seems that the "Causal Body" is a vessel that contains the "Soul" in a realm that humans cannot perceive, such as "Super Consciousness" or "Super Ego."

<b>

This "Causal Body" is also referred to as the "Thought Body" or "Karma Body," and the memories of past lives accumulate like tree rings, indicating and determining the direction of that person's will.

<b>

Therefore, the size of the "Causal Body" directly corresponds to the size of the "Soul."

The combined realm of the "Mental Body" and "Causal Body" is called "Manas" or "Mind Body," and the size of this "Manas" is proportional to the amount of magical power.

...This seems to be the common knowledge of modern magic studies.

<b>

<b>

When it comes to such discussions, it becomes hard to understand.

Even when they say "Soul," it doesn't resonate with me!

<b>

Mr. Henry also said it was fine to just have a rough understanding of it.

From this point onward, it is something that is studied in universities!

<b>

<b>

<b>

However, he did tell me something concerning.

<b>

There are magical beasts that incite and feed off human emotions, known as "monsters."

<b>

"Emotions," that is, the "Astral Body."

They incite emotions like "pain," "fear," and "anger" to grow larger and consume the "Astral Body."

<b>

<b>

"Like... vampires, perhaps?"

<b>

Mr. Henry reacted slightly, quietly saying, "Did you know about them...?"

<b>

"Vampires are abominable beings. They do not only remain at the 'Astral Body' level but also invade part of the 'Manas' and incorporate it as part of their own magical power. Those who become their victims are trapped even in part of their souls, and until they perish, they are removed from the cycle of reincarnation..."

<b>

When the "Manas" is invaded and harmed, the connection between the physical body and the etheric body becomes thin and eventually breaks, leading to the physical body facing death.

There is a "Resurrection Magic" that can repair this connection, but its success rate is extremely low, and as long as there are those who invade the "Manas," it becomes meaningless.

<b>

I felt a slight chill at the top of my head.

Those who made Sonia Mama so sad!

If what the teacher says is true, then Lavie is still not saved!!

In my mind, they became the top priority for extermination.

<b>

<b>

But... this is bad.

The atmosphere became a bit tense and dark...

Oh no, this is awkward!

If I suddenly smile here, they might think I'm strange, what should I do...?

As I was thinking about that.

<b>

"Suzy, I have something that Daisy asked me to bring along for you."

<b>

Mr. Henry said, opening a basket on the wagon, so I reached out to take it and opened it on my lap.

And from inside, what appeared was an apple pie shaped like a rose!!

<b>

"Whoa!!"

<b>

I couldn't help but exclaim in admiration!

Thinly sliced apple wrapped like rose petals, baked in a small cup-shaped crust!

So cute and beautiful!!

<b>

"Daisy baked this for you this morning."

<b>

Mr. Henry said with a smile.

Daisy-sensei!! This is too wonderful!!!

<b>

All the heavy atmosphere from before flew away in an instant!!

As I melted into the sweet apple pie, I was able to spend the rest of the journey very happily.

Thank you! Daisy-sensei!!

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

Cooptown is a city that spreads out in a grid pattern, centered around the station wagon stop, with the main street leading to Dekkenbell.

The workshop I am aiming for is located along a road about two blocks behind the main street.

<b>

The temple Mr. Henry is heading to is on the opposite side of the main street.

He told me that the business would be done in about an hour, so I was dropped off on the main street, and we each headed to our respective destinations.

<b>

<b>

The workshop is a brick building, with a relief of an anvil and hammer mounted above the entrance.

Yup! It's a blacksmith's sign!

<b>

When I opened the entrance door and stepped inside, there was immediately a counter with desks lined up, and a young lady, perhaps a bit older than me, seemed to be doing some office work.

It felt a bit like a post office or bank counter, I thought.

<b>

Noticing me, the young lady asked about my business, so I told her my name and Mr. Howard's name and conveyed my purpose. She then said, "Please wait a moment," and went through a door at the back.

<b>

When she opened the door, I could hear the smell of iron dust and burning metal, along with the sounds of metal being struck and ground.

Ah, while the counter felt bank-like, the back was undoubtedly a blacksmith's workshop.

<b>

Soon, the young lady returned and said, "Thank you for waiting."

Right after that, a stocky, red-faced, muscular old man with a long beard covering his face entered the office.

<b>

"I am Marsh Cowzbart, the master of the workshop."

<b>

He was introduced by the young lady.

As the old man stepped out from behind the counter and approached me.

<b>

"I am Suzy Cloud, nice to meet you."

<b>

I extended my hand for a handshake, and he responded with a short, "Hmm."

However, he looked me up and down suspiciously without making eye contact.

Is he a difficult craftsman?

...Wait? But could this person be...?

<b>

"Are you a dwarf?"

<b>

Marsh's eyebrows twitched slightly.

<b>

"Oh? Is this your first time seeing a dwarf, young lady?"

<b>

The young lady, leaning on the counter and looking at me with interest, asked.

<b>

"Yes, it is! It's my first time meeting a dwarf."

"You are from Amkam Village, right? There are no dwarves in Amkam anymore, so it's understandable."

<b>

According to this young lady, there haven't been any dwarves living in Amkam Village for several years.

Did she think I was a country bumpkin?

<b>

"Actually, I am also a dwarf, you know? Can you tell?"

"Whoa?!"

<b>

I felt a bit caught off guard.

She looked about 15 or 16 years old.

If she had been in a younger form, I might have connected the dots with the old dwarf, but... she seems somewhat different from the dwarves I know?

<b>

<b>

Marsh told me to wait a moment and returned to the counter.

Then the young lady started talking to me about various things.

From our conversation, I learned that this young lady is 28 years old, and her name is Maribel, Marsh's daughter.

Not a young lady, but an older sister...

<b>

Dwarves are said to live over 130 to 150 years, and Marsh is currently 90 years old. He is a dwarf in his prime.

And Maribel being 28 is still considered quite young.

Dwarven women start to grow beards around the age of 50, and by the time they turn 60, they grow beards like men and are finally recognized as adults, after which they reach marriageable age...

<b>

...Ah, I feel a bit sorry.

This was a rather heavy and shocking topic for me...

It really is different!

It's a world that is not what I know!!!

I'm really glad I didn't transfer as a dwarf girl!! I think to myself at this age...

<b>

<b>

While we were talking, Marsh took out some items from a safe-like shelf in the office and began to line them up on the counter.

The items laid out were two sheathed swords and a sword belt.

<b>

"I never thought these would belong to such a petite girl... even one of them has a considerable weight. I can't believe you can handle two..."

<b>

He said, frowning as he walked around the counter.

When he reached me, he took one of the swords from the counter and presented it to me.

<b>

When I easily accepted the sword, Marsh looked surprised, as if he hadn't expected me to lift it so easily.

<b>

I swiftly drew it to check the balance.

Hmm, it's a bit light, but it feels good in my grip.

<b>

I swung it lightly.

Whoosh, I cut through the air to test the swing.

Not bad.

Then, I sheathed it smoothly.

It slid in and fit well. The sheath feels good too.

<b>

I drew it again and held the blade upright in front of me to examine it closely.

It was a beautiful silver blade.

The double-edged blade is about 70 centimeters long, which is a comfortable length for me.

The blade width is about 7 to 8 centimeters.

There aren’t many decorations, but there are Aulora letters engraved on the belly of the blade.

<b>

"‘Without reason, do not grasp the sword. Without virtue, do not swing the sword,’ right?"

"…I see, so it’s not just about appearances… That is Mr. Howard's motto."

<b>

Marsh, who had been staring in astonishment, explained.

He showed me the other sword, which had the same engraving.

<b>

"‘With my daughter, along with my vow.’ This is Mr. Howard's sentiment. Make sure to accept it properly."

<b>

He handed me the second sword as well.

<b>

"…Yes… thank you… very much…!"

<b>

Mr. Howard also referred to me as his daughter...

This is a surprise... that's unfair.

I felt my chest tighten unexpectedly.

I hugged the two swords sheathed tightly to my chest.

<b>

"I'm sorry, young lady, did I make you sentimental? Please take a moment to calm down; we can proceed with the original purpose after you settle down."

<b>

I closed my eyes to steady my breathing, keeping only the warmth of Mr. Howard in my heart to calm myself.

<b>

"Ah, ...I'm sorry, I'm... okay now. What should I do?"

<b>

Marsh seemed impressed that I quickly regained my composure.

<b>

"Well, it's not difficult. You just need to imbue your magical power into that sword. You've done that before, right?"

"Yes, how much should I imbue?"

"Well? You can imbue as much as you can."

"I understand... I will begin."

<b>

Since I didn't know how much magical capacity this sword had, I decided to start slowly and observe.

<b>

Hmm? There was a slight resistance when I first imbued it.

But soon, the resistance decreased gradually, like a pipe widening.

<b>

Since I was cautious, it might have taken a bit longer.

After about a minute of pouring in, it felt like the sword was filled with magical power.

<b>

Hmm, in terms of attack power, it seems to be in the middle of the zero rank. Comparable to Mr. Howard's longsword.

However, the magical power seems to be close to the upper tier of the zero rank?

It feels more like a magical weapon.

<b>

"W-what the...?!"

<b>

Marsh's eyes widened in surprise... huh?

<b>

"Wait, can you maintain that state for a moment?!"

"Ah, yes, I can hold it!"

<b>

Marsh hurriedly went back behind the counter and returned with some kind of tool from the shelf.

<b>

"Just hold that for a moment."

<b>

He began attaching something to the pommel of the sword I was holding.

It seemed he was adjusting something on that tool.

<b>

"I'm amazed, what is this?! Is it exceeding the measurement values of the gauge? Did this sword have this much magical capacity?!!"

<b>

Marsh took the sword from me...

<b>

"Wait here for a moment; I will quickly perform a 'Magic Baking'!"

<b>

He hurriedly entered the workshop.

<b>

"Excuse me, I will make some tea now."

<b>

Maribel said, stepping out from behind the counter.

<b>

"But it's incredible; I could tell even from over there. I've never seen someone imbue that much magical power into a sword before."

<b>

While sitting across from the sofa on the counter, Maribel explained while sipping her tea.

It seems that the sword is woven with mithril silver to make it easier to imbue magical power.

To maintain the strength with a mithril alloy requires considerable skill, and it seems to be in the realm of secret techniques.

<b>

The sight of magical power being infused into the sword was clearly visible to both dwarves, as it is the same as how a blacksmith can understand the state of iron by observing its color when heated.

For dwarves who forge weapons that handle magical power, it is a natural ability.

What Marsh is doing now is called "Magic Baking," which fixes the wielder's magical power into the sword, allowing the mithril within the sword to remember the wielder's magical power.

This enables the wielder to use magic more efficiently when using that weapon.

It seems that the "raw" mithril woven into the sword is imbued with the wielder's magical power, and then the technique of "Magic Baking" is applied.

However, that too is considered a "secret technique"!

<b>

Now, it seems that the magical power I infused was much more than Marsh had anticipated.

Maribel said it looked like it was about to overflow.

That made Marsh hurry to the workshop with the sword.

<b>

I felt a bit guilty for causing such a situation, but when I bowed my head, Maribel smiled and said it was nothing to worry about.

<b>

<b>

As we were talking, Marsh returned from the workshop.

<b>

"Could you imbue magical power into it once more?"

<b>

He handed me the sword, so I took both swords, drew them from their sheaths, and held them lightly, letting them hang down on either side.

Then, I began to flow magical power into both swords.

<b>

Oh? This time, there was no resistance, and it flowed in smoothly.

Moreover, it felt like the amount of magical power I could infuse was increasing?

With this, it might reach the magical attack value of a lower D-rank weapon.

<b>

<b>

"What kind of magical capacity is this... when did I create such high-grade items?!!"

<b>

Marsh looked at me in disbelief.

A bit of sweat dripped down...

I actually wanted to try infusing "Qi" as well... but maybe it's better to hold off on that here?

<b>

<b>

Afterward, I also tried on the sword belt along with the swords.

After adjusting it to fit my waist, it was easy to put on and take off since I just had to buckle it.

<b>

There is an O-ring on the back of the waist, with four belts extending in an X shape from there.

The upper two are belts that wrap around the waist.

The lower two each have a sword holster attached, allowing the swords to be secured with their sheaths.

The position and orientation of these holsters can be adjusted quite freely, making them very convenient.

<b>

I put on the sword belt and practiced drawing and swinging the swords, then returning them to their sheaths several times to test the feel.

Hmm! It feels stylish and nice!!

<b>

"…Hmm, with that fluttering skirt, swinging swords at your waist... how does that work? Doesn't it seem a bit mismatched?"

"…Eh?"

<b>

I felt a bit of sweat at Marsh's evaluation.

Is it a bit shabby?! Or is it?!

<b>

"Come on! Dad, you're so rigid! That mismatch is what makes it stylish! It's quite cute, young lady!"

<b>

I'm glad! Maribel gave me a high rating.

Marsh seemed unconvinced, but Maribel and I exchanged smiles.

<b>

The wind blows from the north.

Next time: "Afternoon in Amkam"
