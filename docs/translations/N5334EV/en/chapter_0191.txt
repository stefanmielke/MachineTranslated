# 179 Episode 179 Dinosaur

Looks like there's a pretty big one under the ground.

It is vibrating like a continuous thrust from a moment ago, as if it is shaking itself and rampaging to get out.

The historic ruins on the ground are now on the verge of collapse as the piled stone walls crumble noisily.

<blank>

Most of the human bandits who were not cannibals or man-beasts in the arena were either crushed by the monsters or squeezed between the walls or stones on the floor, and are in serious trouble. Some of them are barely alive. They are just as stubborn as ever.

Are the knights and knight-errant types other than bandits a little better than them? Well, I guess their original physical condition is different.

However, I had kicked down the knight-like guys who had not been crushed by the monsters when I ran around downstairs earlier, so not a single one of them was still awake!

<blank>

But it seems that about half of the knights who were in this fort were not in this arena party because they were elsewhere.

However, he must have sensed something unusual in the overflow of magical beasts and looked around to see what was going on.

And now the earth is vibrating terribly, and an eerie sound like an earth tremor, like a roar, is echoing around the area from the bottom.

I guess it's the all-around alert. ...... No? Are they starting to prepare to pull out? You're quick to assess the situation.

<blank>

However, it is very slow because of the debuff I just applied to it. It is terribly slow.

I'll make these guys witnesses, too. I won't let them get away with it, okay?

<blank>

At that moment, there was a loud, downward thrust, causing the entire fort to shake and the sound of an explosion echoed around the area.

In the next instant, a wall of earth and sand rose up from the other side of the arena wall, as if it had erupted, and blew away the middle of the auditorium.

Something seems to have exploded from underground outside the arena.

There was a deep, large hole drilled into it.

<blank>

<blank>

The seats across from where Gohl and I are now rattled and collapsed, and the rim of a large hole extended into the arena.

The edge of that large hole can be seen from this location.

And there is also a sign of something huge stirring in the back of it.

<blank>

I've been on ...... for a while now. Is this your trump card?"

<blank>

When the situation got out of hand, he was going to release that thing and stomp out the hexagombs! It's the last, the real backstage trick! I don't care how much you do, you can't help that thing! Kukaka kuka kaka ...... gafu!

<blank>

It must have taken a lot of strain to call this out, and Gohl spurted blood from the back of his throat.

Well, you wouldn't do this to me. They are undead, after all!

I don't see a problem with letting this guy go for now.

<blank>

But let's keep it restrained, just in case: .......

<blank>

Mass Field Roots.

It is an enchanted channeler debuffing skill that puts multiple enemies around you in a hold state for a certain amount of time.

<blank>

The ivy of magic entangles every wriggling man-eater, man-beast, surviving bandit, knight-errant, and pseudo-knight in this fortress, including Gohl, and binds them to the spot.

<blank>

Gohl is ranting something about his body suddenly being trapped and restrained by the magical ivy, but there is no need to be concerned.

<blank>

But first, we have to deal with the "backdoor" thing in front of us.

I know it's a pretty big hexenbiest.

<blank>

First of all, I decided to jump toward the big hole to see it from the sky.

When I stepped out in the audience, the place collapsed and Gohl got caught up and rolled down to the bottom, but I don't care.

<blank>

<blank>

I jumped up and saw the back of the hole, and then I felt a rapid convergence of magic power coming from the back of it.

And from there, something was shot at me with great force.

<blank>

It was a block of rock.

A chunk of rock about three meters in diameter came flying in a straight line like a cannonball from the back of the hole.

In fact, explosions were heard that sounded like artillery fire.

<blank>

But I kicked the rock cannonball that was coming toward me as hard as I could in the air.

The rock exploded violently on the spot, scattering debris all around.

<blank>

The recoil from the kick and the force of the rock explosion swept me backward slightly and I landed on the edge of the hole.

<blank>

From there, we can visualize the inside of the hole. The hole itself is quite deep. It looks like the ceiling of a huge limestone cave collapsed and a huge cave entrance appeared.

<blank>

The edges of the hole are ragged and still crumbling and quite dangerous.

But it looks like it is possible to get in and out of the building from here, as the scaffolding is made of earth and sand where the ceiling was collapsed.

It is made of large and small boulders formed by the wreckage of the ceiling and would be a tough climbing route for people, but it may be enough for a huge magical beast to get in and out.

<blank>

<blank>

Then a presence approaches.

The vibrations that shake the area also become louder. It is the vibration of a huge object stepping on the earth.

Then this guy shook the area and emerged from the depths of the cave.

<blank>

The red twin eyes shimmer with a yuletide shimmer as they make a menacing sound that says Glororo .......

Two pairs of them. Four red eyes emerged from the depths of the jet-black cave into the starlight.

<blank>

It is a magical beast named "Dinosaur".

Its appearance is that of a Komodo dragon with two huge, long necks.

I'd say it's over 30 meters long.

<blank>

It is quite large, but this guy is not a "dragon species".

In a previous magical biology class, Dr. Nosoli taught us.

He said that the difference between dragon species and lizards and other reptiles can be distinguished by their skeletons.

The four legs of the dragon species are called "upright quadrupeds," which are attached vertically under the body, just like elephants and other mammals.

Lizards and crocodiles, on the other hand, are what are called "horizontal quadrupeds" that spread out horizontally under the body, he said.

Therefore, no matter how big their bodies are, "horizontal quadrupeds" are not dragons, but reptiles and lizards, he said with great force.

<blank>

The way the big thing in front of me now has legs is the latter.

In other words, this guy is a big lizard. A giant reptile.

<blank>

I looked at the guy.

It seems that he recognized me.

<blank>

His left neck extended toward us, and his mouth opened wide.

And there the magic converges again.

As you look at it, you can see the rocky mass taking shape in its open mouth.

Just as the rock had grown to a mouthful, another bombardment-like explosion echoed through the limestone caves.

This guy shot that rock out.

<blank>

The rock shells flying from below hit me at my feet, where they exploded in a huge explosion.

The ground where I was standing had been gouged out, and a large amount of earth and sand was being sent up.

The flying sediment is amazing. The amount of dust and dirt completely blocked my view.

<blank>

Well, I'm not there already.

He jumped to a rock that seemed to provide a foothold in the cave and was already descending into its interior.

<blank>

<blank>

This guy is using magic, but it's a little different from the intermediate level "rock cannonball" that sends rocks flying.

One head produces the basic magic "rock mass" and the other head shoots it out using the basic magic "air burst" also.

While one neck produces a block of rock, the other neck takes in air, compresses it inside the body, and shoots out the rock with the force of the explosion.

The two heads alternate in doing so.

So to speak, it is a giant air gun using a block of rock.

<blank>

I see, they used this artillery to shoot through the ceiling of the limestone caves.

<blank>

There is a slight pause in the pause, but its power is high enough.

It's a good example of how even basic magic can become a serious threat when used on such a large scale.

But how strong are your lungs if you're not afraid to let the air burst inside your body over and over again? Is it good because it's a hexenbiest?

<blank>

Looking up from below, you can see how big this guy is.

I think it's 5-6 meters tall.

From head to tail it looks to be about 40 meters long.

It is truly a monster.

<blank>

But compared to the real dragons I've seen in the past, is their presence ...... less dense?

It's just a big figure, but it gives the impression of being skimpy.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, now this guy seems to have lost me.

So I decided to kick a little chunk of rock that was nearby and hit the dinosaur.

<blank>

The size of the rock is about 5 meters.

The rock he kicked hit the target faster than the rock bullet this guy shot, but it shattered into pieces the moment it hit.

Perhaps this rock was part of the ceiling of a limestone cave. I bet it wasn't as dense as it could have been.

<blank>

Dinosaur seemed to stagger a bit when it hit, but it didn't seem to do much damage.

I knew it looks pretty sturdy.

<blank>

I see, I think this guy is not a formidable opponent even if there are 200 or 300 guards.

Once this guy is unleashed out there, the city of Hexagom is easily overrun.

<blank>

In terms of threat value, is it more than 30?

You would need a battle value of 6th or higher in the middle of the pack to take on Kore.

It is a little too much for Bibi and Mia.

<blank>

I know that Bibi and his friends are now at the foot of this mountain, as it is within my search area.

We cannot let this large magical beast out now.

Of course, I have no intention of putting it out!

So I will promptly take care of it here.

<blank>

The prey is a little too big, and it would be too much trouble if I had to use my sword to cut it down. I think I'll just use my skills and get it over with.

<blank>

Of course, I'm going to use my skills in a very hands-off way.

The weapons used are also D-ranked, so it shouldn't be that bad!

<blank>

<blank>

Nine Light Stars.

Divine proximity job dueling barbarian skills.

It is the most powerful skill in the melee range, drawing nine light trails at the speed of light and indiscriminately attacking enemies around you.

<blank>

Dinosaurs who discovered me resumed their bombardment and fired rockets at me in rapid succession, but I used my skills without regard to such attacks.

<blank>

The impact of the skill's activation envelops the area with intense light and roar.

<blank>

The fact that it travels through the atmosphere at the speed of light causes the atmosphere outside of its trajectory to compress momentarily.

The light trails that brought destruction painted in several caves were caused by ultra-high pressure plasma over a wide area.

<blank>

The body of the large demonic beast at the center of the super-high pressure was instantly reduced to atoms and annihilated without leaving a single bone fragment.

The stalactite caves exposed to the high-pressure plasma turned to dust from the inside and blew away the entire mountain.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Bibi and Mia, who had reached the foot of the mountain at that time, told me after we joined them that they "saw a tremendously thick pillar of light rise up as if the mountain had erupted" with a ground-shaking sound.

<blank>

Bibi's eyes at that time were very, very scary!
