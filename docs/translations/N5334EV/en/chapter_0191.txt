# Chapter 179: Dinosaur

It seems that something quite large is lurking underground.

Is it thrashing about, trying to break free? The vibrations have been continuous, resembling repeated upward thrusts.

The stone walls of the historical site above are creaking and on the verge of collapse.

<b>

The ordinary human thieves, not the man-eating beasts, have mostly been crushed by the magical beasts in this arena, or they are trapped and crushed by the stones of the walls or floor, resulting in a dire situation. There are a few who are barely alive. As expected, these thieves are tenacious.

The knights, or those who resemble knights, are somewhat better off than them? Well, their original physical condition must be different.

However, even those knights who weren't crushed by the magical beasts are not awake, as I kicked them down while running around below earlier!

<b>

But it seems that about half of the knights in this fortress were elsewhere and did not participate in this arena party.

However, they likely sensed the abnormality of the overflow of magical beasts and were observing the situation.

And now, the ground is violently shaking, and an eerie sound like a rumble is echoing from below.

Are they in a full alert state...? No? Are they starting to prepare for retreat? Their situational judgment is quick.

<b>

However, the debuff I cast earlier is effective, so their movements are very slow. They are incredibly sluggish.

I'll make them witnesses too. I won't let them escape!

<b>

At that moment, a particularly large upward thrust occurred, shaking the entire fortress and causing an explosion sound to echo around.

In the next moment, a wall of earth erupted from the other side of the arena, as if there had been an eruption, blowing debris into the middle of the audience area.

It seems something exploded from underground outside the arena.

A deep pit had been created there.

<b>

<b>

The audience seats directly across from where I am with Goul collapsed with a rumble, and the edge of the pit extended into the arena.

From this location, I can see the edge of that pit.

And I can also sense the presence of something massive writhing within.

<b>

“...I see. Is this your trump card?”

<b>

“When things become hopeless, I was planning to unleash that and crush Hexagum! The ultimate, genuine last resort! No matter how tough you are, there's no way to deal with that! Kukakakaka... Gah!!”

<b>

It seems summoning this took quite a toll on Goul, as he coughed up blood from deep in his throat.

Well, he probably won't be finished off by something like this. After all, he is originally undead!

For now, leaving him be shouldn't be a problem.

<b>

But I should bind him just in case...

<b>

『Mass Field Roots』

This is a debuff skill of the Enchant Channeler that traps multiple enemies around oneself in a hold state for a certain period.

<b>

Including Goul, the writhing man-eating beasts in this fortress, the surviving thieves, and the fallen knights are all ensnared and bound by the magical vines without exception.

<b>

Goul is shouting something as his body is suddenly ensnared by the magical vines, but there's no need to pay it any mind.

<b>

More importantly, I need to deal with the “last resort” right in front of me.

I can tell it’s a rather large magical beast.

<b>

First, I'll try to get a visual from above, so I decide to jump toward the pit.

When I pushed off from the audience seats, that spot collapsed, and it seems Goul got caught up and rolled down.

But I won't worry about that.

<b>

<b>

As I jumped up and caught sight of the depths of the pit, I felt a rapid convergence of magical power from within.

Then, something was shot toward me with great force from there.

<b>

It was a chunk of rock.

A rock about 3 meters in diameter flew straight at me from the depths of the pit like a cannonball.

In fact, I could hear an explosive sound as if it were being fired.

<b>

However, I kicked the incoming rock projectile with all my might in midair.

The rock exploded violently on impact, scattering fragments all around.

<b>

The recoil from my kick and the explosion of the rock caused me to be pushed slightly backward, landing at the edge of the pit.

<b>

From there, I try to observe the inside. The pit itself is quite deep. It feels like the ceiling of a massive limestone cave has collapsed, revealing the entrance to a gigantic cave.

<b>

The edge of the pit is still crumbling and is quite dangerous.

However, the debris from the collapsed ceiling has created a foothold, making it seem possible to enter and exit from here.

It's made up of large and small rock fragments from the ceiling, which would be a tough climbing route for a person, but it might be sufficient for a giant magical beast to enter and exit.

<b>

<b>

At that moment, a presence approaches.

The vibrations shaking the surroundings grow stronger. It's the tremor of a massive creature stepping on the ground.

And it shakes the area, revealing itself from the depths of the cave.

<b>

A threatening sound like “Grololo...” resonates, and two red eyes sway ominously.

Two pairs of red eyes emerge from the depths of the pitch-black cave, illuminated by starlight.

<b>

That is a magical beast known as “Dinosaur.”

Its form resembles a Komodo dragon with two long necks.

Its body length is over 30 meters, I would say.

<b>

It’s quite large, but this one is not a “dragon type.”

In a previous class on magical biology, Professor Nosori taught us.

The difference between dragon types and reptiles like lizards can be distinguished by their skeletal structure.

The four legs of dragon types are attached vertically under the body, similar to mammals like elephants, which is called “erect quadrupedal.”

On the other hand, lizards and crocodiles have legs that spread horizontally beneath their bodies, referred to as “sprawling quadrupedal.”

So no matter how large the body is, “sprawling quadrupedal” creatures are not dragons but reptiles and lizards, he emphasized.

<b>

The way the large creature in front of me stands on its legs is of the latter type.

In other words, this is a huge lizard. A gigantic reptile.

<b>

It locked eyes with me.

It seems it has noticed me.

<b>

The left neck of the creature stretches toward me, and its mouth opens wide.

Once again, magical power converges within.

I can see rocks forming rapidly inside its opened mouth.

When the rocks grow to fill its mouth, an explosive sound like cannon fire echoes through the limestone cave.

It shot out that rock.

<b>

The rock projectile that flew from below struck at my feet, exploding magnificently.

The ground where I had been standing was deeply gouged, sending a massive amount of earth flying.

The flying debris was incredible. It created a cloud of dust that completely obscured my vision.

<b>

Well, I’m not in that spot anymore.

I had already jumped to a rock that seemed like it could serve as a foothold within the cave and descended inside.

<b>

<b>

What it’s using is magic, but it’s somewhat different from the mid-level “Rock Cannonball” that shoots rocks.

One neck creates the basic magic “Rock,” while the other neck uses the basic magic “Air Burst” to shoot it out.

While one neck is creating the rock, the other neck is taking in air, compressing it inside its body, and then using that explosive force to shoot out the rock.

The two necks alternate in this process.

In other words, it’s a gigantic air gun using rocks.

<b>

I see, it used this cannon fire to pierce through the ceiling of the limestone cave.

<b>

There’s a slight pause, but its power is sufficiently high.

Even basic magic, when used on this scale, becomes a significant threat; it’s a good example of that.

But how durable must its lungs be to withstand multiple air bursts inside its body? Is it because it’s a magical beast?

<b>

Looking up from below, I can clearly see its size.

Its height is about 5 to 6 meters.

From head to tail, it seems to be around 40 meters long.

It truly is a monster.

<b>

However, compared to the real dragon I saw long ago, its presence... feels... less dense?

It gives the impression of being large in size but somewhat hollow.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, it seems this creature has lost sight of me.

So, I decided to kick a nearby rock fragment and hit the Dinosaur with it.

<b>

The rock was about 5 meters in size.

The kicked rock hit it faster than the rock projectile it shoots, but it shattered into pieces the moment it made contact.

I suppose this rock was part of the ceiling of the limestone cave. It probably didn’t have that much density.

<b>

The Dinosaur seemed to stagger slightly upon impact, but it didn’t appear to take much damage.

It seems quite sturdy after all.

<b>

I see, even if there were 200 or 300 guards, this creature would be far beyond their capability.

If it were released outside, the city of Hexagum would be easily trampled.

<b>

In terms of threat level, is it over 30?

To deal with this, a combat value of at least 6th in the mid-tier would be necessary.

It’s a bit too much for Vibi and Mia right now.

<b>

I also know that Vibi and the others have reached the foot of this mountain within my exploration range.

I cannot let this large magical beast out now.

Of course, I have no intention of letting it out!

So I plan to deal with it here quickly.

<b>

The prey is a bit too large, and using my sword to slice it would be a hassle. I think I’ll just use my skills to finish it off quickly.

<b>

Of course, I intend to use my skills with some restraint.

The weapon I’ll use is also of D-rank, so it shouldn’t be too terrible!

<b>

<b>

『Nine Light Stars』

A skill of the divine close-combat class Duel Barbarian.

It draws nine trails of light at the speed of light, attacking all enemies around me indiscriminately; it’s the highest damage skill in close range.

<b>

The Dinosaur, having spotted me, resumes its cannon fire, continuously shooting rock projectiles at me, but I disregard such attacks and activate my skill.

<b>

With the impact of the skill activation, intense light and a roaring sound envelop the area.

<b>

Due to moving at the speed of light through the atmosphere, the air outside the trail is instantaneously compressed.

The light trails drawn within the multiple caves brought forth destruction, generating super-high-pressure plasma over a wide area.

<b>

The body of the large magical beast, which was at the center of that super-high pressure, was instantly reduced to atoms, disappearing without leaving a trace of bone.

Furthermore, the limestone cave, exposed to the high-pressure plasma, turned to dust from the inside and was blown away along with the mountain.

<b>

<b>

<b>

At that time, Vibi and Mia, who had reached the foot of the mountain, later told me that they saw “a tremendously thick pillar of light rising as if the mountain had erupted, accompanied by a rumble.”

<b>

Vibi's eyes at that moment were incredibly, incredibly scary!
