All modern people have stiff bodies, but seniors are even firmer.

'Mm-hmm, is that right?'

Look at these legs!　You're shaking it like this, but your ankle doesn't shake at all.　It's frozen in place."

Aren't they all like this?"

Usually they move more or less."

Mmmm."

If you are stiff, it means that you are unconsciously exerting yourself continuously. You should start by becoming aware of how much energy you are wasting on a daily basis.

I'm not aware of that at all!"

Well, it's the result of continuing to do unreasonable movements in an unnatural posture. If you are not aware of your bad habits, there is no way to correct them.

I don't know if I've been in an unnatural posture or not.　I've been living a normal life..."

That's because people today have already begun to harden in childhood. When they enter elementary school, they are taught to 'be careful' and 'get in front of the class,' and that's the worst. That's the worst. They get into the habit of standing with a lot of strength.

Ue!　Really?　Everybody did it!"

That's why all people today are so stiff. My teacher said, 'Almost no one today can stand or walk properly. Few people today can stand or walk properly.

"Ugh... what does the world look like from a guru's point of view?"

So, let's start with this foot massage.

"Ugh...looks like we have a long way to go. ......"

<blank>

...I had some kind of nostalgic dream....

<blank>

About 7 years ago, I was a year junior on the same team at work.

We got along with each other in some way and often hung out after the project was over.

<blank>

He seemed to be an apprentice of some great old martial arts teacher, and he often told me martial arts-related stories.

I was taken to performances by various martial arts instructors, and we often spent time together outside of work.

<blank>

In the slumber of dawn, I was remembering such things. .........

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

We ended up spending the night that day on the riverbank at that waterfall basin.

<blank>

What on earth were they doing with the time they had from mid-afternoon on? I don't have to tell you.

<blank>

Their physical strength and resilience beyond human knowledge may have been the key to opening new doors.

<blank>

Even so, it is not recommended to spend your first night in the wild in a strange place without clothes.

At dawn, he would get up and bathe in shame, but when he returned to his tent, he wriggled around and bathed again and again, so I guess he was not too sorry.

<blank>

The items I had with me were useful for the encampment.

It's a quest item in your inventory.

It was not possible to take it out at the time of the game, but now it seems to be possible to take it out and use it.

<blank>

Last night, I took a "simple tent for one person," a "villager's blanket," and animal pelts from the query items and used them.

The meal was "Mam's Salmon Stew", a recovery item I had (e.g. to recover a small amount of HP), so I ate that. ......

<blank>

They say it's 'very tasteless.

Anyway, the taste is thin and almost nonexistent.

<blank>

There are various other recovery items that could be food, but they all have little or no flavor.

<blank>

It's not that I can't eat it, but it's not something I want to reach out and eat myself.

<blank>

It was Suzy who thought, "Let's hold off on eating until our hunger pangs reach their limit .......

<blank>

<blank>

Equipment was also taken from the guild warehouse at a lower level.

<blank>

In the game, equipment was ranked in 11 basic levels.

<blank>

Zero Rank" used by beginners level who have just started the game and before they have a job.

D and C ranks," which can be used by taking the first job.

After that, "B and A ranks" that can be equipped after advancing to professional positions.

Further beyond that, "S and SS ranks" that can be used after evolving into specialized types.

And "G Zero, G1, G2, and G3 ranks" that can be used by those who have transcended man and become deities to the divine realm.

<blank>

Suzy was equipped with a G Zero higher level, the Nemesis Dual Sword and Oracle Heavy Armor.

<blank>

But that, too, is small fry equipment in the game, to be sure.

<blank>

Still, it seems to be quite over-specified for this location.

<blank>

Now Susie was wearing A-rated equipment.

Jet-black plate armor, two swords shining white and silver, no cloak.

The sword is wide and martial, though finely decorated on the belly of the blade.

<blank>

I guess we'll see how it goes.　Let's try without enchantment. If it looks dangerous, I'll just put the equipment back on!

<blank>

Originally, the guild warehouse stored a set of equipment for each rank and occupation, as well as for sub-character training.

This time, they found and took out equipment that was neither too high nor too low.

<blank>

<blank>

The mobs that were scattered around yesterday have come back today.

<blank>

Use the search to see what's going on around you right now.

Then, immediately, he turned his head to the right upward.

The flying mob could be seen moving from right to left direction.

<blank>

I didn't see any flying mobs or ...... 'grey wyverns' yesterday. I'd say it's about 90 meters away.

<blank>

HAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! and with a kiai, he puts his "chi" into the weapon.

<blank>

I knew this would be the first shot at long range!　In the game, the range was 15 meters at best, but here I feel like I can reach something!

<blank>

As he said this, he thrust out his left arm and sat back with his right hand at face level.

He points the tip of his two swords at the target and shouts.

<blank>

I'm gonna shoot you!

<blank>

≪Impact Blaster≫.

It sends out a pool of sword chi to attack enemies at a distance.

It is the skill of the proximity attacker "Duel Barbarian".

<blank>

The impact, visible from the tip of the sword, exceeds the speed of sound and heads toward the target, emitting a white light.

<blank>

Target and white light intersect.

A moment later, it exploded and scattered.

<blank>

A beat later, a dull popping sound like something heavy popping is heard.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"..............., you filthy fireworks."

<blank>

I said it.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Conclusion!　Mob's around here are small fry!"

<blank>

He concluded.

<blank>

A streak or two, sweat dripping down my cheeks.

<blank>

I knew I had to find someone a little stronger!"

<blank>

I put my hands over my eyes and posed as if I were scurrying to look into the distance.

<blank>

"All I see when I look at this stuff is trees. ...... Is there some higher ground somewhere?　If we go that way, there might be something much stronger than here.

<blank>

I looked at the white wall of snowy mountains to the north and thought to myself.

<blank>

I wonder how high it is?　Is it as high as Mount Everest?　I've never been there, so I don't know!　Is it 8,000 meters or something?　It would be nice to look down on the world from up there.

<blank>

With his left hand on his hip and his right hand scratching his temple with his pollyanna .......

<blank>

"......, why don't we just jump?"

<blank>

He muttered something like he had an idea.

<blank>

I don't have a jump point, but I feel like I could at least jump up normally."

<blank>

In the game, the character who has been "divinized" has a means of transportation that allows him to jump up from a predetermined jump point and then fly across to any location. ......, but there is no jump point here.

<blank>

'But you can just jump up, right?　Jump as fast as you can, and I haven't done it yet. ...... I'll try anything I think I can do!　That's the key to enjoying the game!

<blank>

He said this and bent down to save his strength.

<blank>



<blank>

At the moment he kicked the earth, the land caved in significantly.

<blank>

Pulled by their roots by the gouging ground, the surrounding trees tried to fall down, but the spread of the shock wave that occurred next caused them to be reaped outward with great force.

The one who kicked the earth with a roaring sound was already far above the ground.

<blank>

"Woo hot ......, isn't this thing high, like 4 to 50 meters up?"

<blank>

In the sky where the wind blows and connects, he looks around and is amazed at his own leaping ability.

<blank>

'I was hoping to fly a couple of meters, but ...... this?　Did you go about 60?　This is the view from a tower apartment or something, right?　I've never been up there!

<blank>

Eventually, I reached the point of the leap and could see with my own eyes beyond the horizon.

<blank>

"Aaaaah!　The forest extends all the way to the horizon except for the mountain range in the north!　This forest must be the size of the Kanto Plain!　It's a sea of trees, or rather, it's a deep sea of trees!　But the forest is a bit thin in the south. ......?

<blank>

Eventually, its body began to yukkuri its descent.

<blank>

Oh?　Oh?　Oh!　Falling down!　but!　BUT!　It's ......, right?　It's Yumu, right?　Whoo-hoo-hoo!

<blank>

As it was, it landed with a heavy vibration on the ground, sending up a cloud of dust.

<blank>

I was so surprised!　I was fine!　That's just like a dream!　I was so scared!　Thank God it was a dream!

<blank>

He landed cleanly on both legs while making a crater.

He then poked his hands at Petali, got down on all fours, and let out a shrill cry.

<blank>

<blank>

Now that we know more about our surroundings than we thought we did, let's go to ...... and see what we can do."

<blank>

However, I immediately stood up as if I had regained my composure and looked around with my hands on my hips.

<blank>

'I had a feeling that there might be people beyond the south: ....... The theory is that if you want to advance in the game, you should go down to the human village and gather information, but there's obviously nothing stronger than here in the south. ...... However, I have a feeling that there is something in those mountains. ......, but only vaguely. We will have to make a base in a human village sooner or later, so we have to figure out how to route it .......

<blank>

<blank>

I thought about it as I folded my fingers.

<blank>

"Once down in the village, we'll get ready and head for the mountains, then return to the village after our exploration."

<blank>

We're going to head up into the mountains to explore, and then we're going to head for the human village."

<blank>

"We're going to cut through the forest and build a place to live here: ......

<blank>

Crossing my arms, I look at the mountains and think.

<blank>

If you're going to the mountains, what do you need to prepare?　Equipment and food to get through the forest and into the mountains?　I think we can get by with what we have on hand for gear. Food is also ...... if you don't want to be extravagant. I'm getting pretty sick of the thought of leaving the forest and then going back and forth to this deep sea of trees again. ......?

<blank>

He looked up toward the mountain range.

<blank>

I'm going to go to the store and buy a new one!　I've made up my mind!"

<blank>

It moves itself in the north direction.

<blank>

First we'll explore the mountains!　Then we head south."

<blank>

He holds up his index finger to his mouth and seems to be thinking about something.

<blank>

We should at least take some water with us. Go to the watering hole, fetch water and get ...... ready. ...... and ...... and then ...... and then ......?　...... hey?"

<blank>

Toto, for some reason with a faint blush on his cheeks, made a short run to the water.

<blank>

"Well, I'll start with ......, and then I'll go to ......."

<blank>

They are going to do something before they leave.
