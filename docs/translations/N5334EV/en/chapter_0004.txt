"That's why, modern people are all stiff, but you, senpai, are even stiffer."

"Is that so?"

"Look at this leg! Even though I'm shaking it, my ankle isn't moving at all, right? It's completely stiff."

"Isn't everyone like this?"

"Normally, it moves to some extent."

"Hmm."

"Being stiff means you're unconsciously tensing up. You need to start by realizing how much unnecessary energy you're wasting every day."

"I have no such awareness at all!"

"Well, it's the result of maintaining unnatural postures and forcing movements. You can't fix bad habits unless you recognize them."

"Did I really maintain such unnatural postures? I thought I lived normally..."

"That's the thing, modern people start to stiffen up from childhood. The 'attention' and 'stand at ease' postures they do in elementary school are the worst. They develop a habit of tensing up while standing."

"Ugh! Is that so? Everyone did that!"

"That's why modern people are all stiff. My master said, 'There are hardly any modern people who can stand or walk properly.'"

"Wow... How does a master see the world?"

"So, senpai, let's start by loosening up this leg."

"Ugh... This seems like a long road ahead..."

<b>

...I had a nostalgic dream...

<b>

About seven years ago, a junior who joined the same team at work a year after me.

We got along well and hung out often even after the project ended.

<b>

It seems he was a disciple of an amazing teacher of ancient martial arts, and he often taught me about martial arts.

I was taken to various martial arts demonstrations, and we spent a lot of time together outside of work.

<b>

In the early morning haze, I was reminiscing about those times...

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, I spent the night by that waterfall.

<b>

What did I even do with my time after noon? It's needless to say.

<b>

The extraordinary stamina and recovery might have been the key to opening a new door.

<b>

Still, spending the first night camping in an unfamiliar place without clothes is not something to be recommended.

I woke up in the early morning, feeling embarrassed, and took a bath, but when I returned to the tent, I was fidgeting and repeatedly bathing, so I probably didn't reflect much.

<b>

The items I brought for camping came in handy.

They were quest items in my inventory.

I couldn't take them out during the game, but now it seems I can take them out and use them.

<b>

Last night, I used the 'one-person simple tent' and 'villager's blanket' from the quest items, along with some animal fur.

For food, I had a recovery item called 'Mom's salmon stew' that recovers a small amount of HP, so I tried eating it... but.

<b>

"It seems very unappetizing."

The taste was extremely bland and almost nonexistent.

<b>

There were other recovery items that looked like they could be food, but they all had little to no flavor.

<b>

It's not that they were inedible, but they weren't something I wanted to reach for and eat.

<b>

I thought I would hold off on eating until my hunger reached its limit... Suzy thought.

<b>

I also took out low-level equipment from the guild storage.

<b>

In the game, equipment was basically categorized into 11 ranks.

<b>

At the very beginning, before taking on a job, you could use 'Zero Rank' equipment.

Once you took on your first job, you could use 'D and C Rank' equipment.

After that, you could equip 'B and A Rank' equipment after advancing to a specialized job.

Further on, you could use 'S and SS Rank' equipment after evolving into a specialized type.

And finally, those who transcended humanity and became divine could use 'G Zero, G1, G2, and G3 Rank' equipment.

<b>

Suzy was equipped with the upper tier of G Zero, the Nemesis Dual Sword and Oracle Heavy Armor.

<b>

However, to be frank, that was considered low-tier equipment in the game.

<b>

Even so, it seemed quite over-spec in this land.

<b>

Right now, Suzy was wearing A Rank equipment.

A jet-black plate armor with silver shining dual swords, and no cape.

The swords were broad, with fine decorations on the blade, but they were rugged.

<b>

"Okay, let's just observe for now! I'll go without enchantments. If it looks dangerous, I can switch back to my old gear!"

<b>

Originally, the guild storage had equipment for each rank and each job, stored in sets for sub-character development.

This time, I picked out equipment that wasn't too high or too low.

<b>

<b>

"The mobs that were scattered yesterday have returned quite a bit today."

<b>

Using exploration, I checked the current situation around me.

Then, I quickly looked up to the upper right.

I could see a flying mob moving from the right to the left.

<b>

"Is that a flying mob I didn't see yesterday...? A 'Gray Wyvern.' The distance is about 90 meters, I guess?"

<b>

Haaah!! With a shout, I concentrated my 'ki' into my weapon.

<b>

"After all, the first strike at long range is this! In the game, the range was only about 15 meters, but here, it feels like I can reach something!"

<b>

Saying that, I extended my left arm, raised my right hand to face level, and lowered my waist.

I aimed the tips of my dual swords at the target and shouted.

<b>

"I'm going to take aim!!!"

<b>

≪Impact Blaster≫

I unleashed the gathered sword energy to attack the distant enemy.

A skill of the close-combat attacker 'Duel Barbarian.'

<b>

The shockwave released from the sword tip became visible, exceeding the speed of sound and shining white as it headed toward the target.

<b>

The target and the white light intersected.

A moment later, it exploded and scattered.

<b>

A beat later, a dull explosion sound echoed, like something heavy bursting.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"...........What a dirty firework."

<b>

I said it.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Conclusion! The mobs around here are weak!!"

<b>

I concluded.

<b>

With a few beads of sweat trickling down my cheeks.

<b>

"After all, I need to look for a stronger opponent!"

<b>

I placed my hand above my eyes and struck a pose as if looking around the distance.

<b>

"Even if I look at this, all I see are trees... Is there a higher ground somewhere? If I could get up there, I'm sure there would be much stronger ones than here."

<b>

I gazed at the snow-capped mountains rising to the north, resembling white walls.

<b>

"I wonder how high they are? Is it like Everest? I've never been there, so I don't know! Is it around 8000 meters? Looking down at the world from up there would be nice."

<b>

With my left hand on my hip, I scratched my temple with my right hand...

<b>

"Should I just jump?"

<b>

I muttered as if I had thought of something.

<b>

"There's no jump point, but I feel like I could jump normally."

<b>

In the game, characters who had undergone 'divinization' could jump from designated jump points to travel to any location... but there were no jump points here.

<b>

"But I can probably just jump up, right? I haven't tried jumping with all my strength yet... Trying out what I can do is the key to enjoying the game!"

<b>

Saying that, I crouched down, gathering strength.

<b>

"Here I go!!!"

<b>

The moment I kicked off the ground, the earth caved in dramatically.

<b>

The ground was uprooted, and the surrounding trees began to topple, but the next shockwave spread out and forcefully knocked them down.

The roar echoed around as I kicked the ground, and I was already far above in the sky.

<b>

"Whoa, this is high, right? I'm at least 40 to 50 meters up!"

<b>

As the wind blew, I looked around, astonished by my own jumping ability.

<b>

"I thought I could jump 2 to 3 meters... but what is this?! Did I go 60 meters?! This is like the view from a tower mansion! I've never climbed one, though!!!"

<b>

Eventually, I reached the apex of my jump and could see the horizon.

<b>

"Whoa! Except for the northern mountains, the horizon is covered in forest! This forest is about the size of the Kanto Plain, right? It's like a sea of trees, or rather, this is a tree deep sea! But the south seems a bit less dense... maybe?"

<b>

Gradually, I began to descend slowly.

<b>

"Oh? Oh? Oh! I'm falling! But! But! It's okay, right?! It's a dream, so it's fine! Whoa!!!"

<b>

I landed heavily on the ground, creating a crater and kicking up dust.

<b>

"I-I was surprised! I was fine! As expected of a dream! Ah, I was so scared! I'm glad it was a dream!!!"

<b>

Even while creating a crater, I landed perfectly on both legs.

After that, I put my hands down and got on all fours, letting out a pained scream.

<b>

<b>

"Now, I've grasped the situation around me better than I thought... what should I do now?"

<b>

But I quickly stood up as if I had regained my composure and looked around with my hands on my hips.

<b>

"I somehow felt that there might be people to the south... In the game, the theory is to go down to a human settlement for information gathering, but clearly, there are no stronger ones than here. However, I have a feeling there might be something in that mountain... just a feeling. Eventually, I must make a human settlement my base, but how to route there... hmm."

<b>

I pondered while counting on my fingers.

<b>

"First, go down to the human settlement, prepare, then head to the mountain and return to the settlement after exploring."

<b>

"Go straight to the mountain, explore, then aim for the human settlement."

<b>

"Clear the forest and create a living space here... No way."

<b>

I crossed my arms and thought while looking at the mountain.

<b>

"What kind of preparations do I need to head to the mountain? Equipment and food to pass through the forest and enter the mountain? I think I can manage with my current equipment. As for food... as long as I don't ask for luxury... I guess. Exiting the forest and then going back and forth through this tree deep sea seems quite exhausting when I think about it..."

<b>

I looked up towards the mountain range.

<b>

"Alright! I've decided!"

<b>

I moved towards the north.

<b>

"First, I'll explore the mountain! Then head south."

<b>

I raised my index finger to my mouth, as if deep in thought.

<b>

"I should at least take some water with me. I'll go to the water source, fill up, and... prepare. ...Various things... and then... maybe? ...Right?"

<b>

With a slight blush on my cheeks for some reason, I jogged towards the water source.

<b>

"Okay, first... then... right?"

<b>

It seems like I would do something before departing.
