“So, you see, modern people are all stiff, but seniors are even more so.”

"Is that so?”

“Look at my feet! Even though I'm shaking them like this, my ankles don't move at all, do they? They're still stiff.“

”Isn't everyone like this?“

”Normally, they move to some extent.“

”Hmm...”

“The fact that you're stiff means you're unconsciously continuing to put in effort. You need to start by becoming aware of how much energy you're wasting on a daily basis.“

”I'm not aware of that at all!“

”Well, it's the result of continuing to make unnatural movements in an unnatural posture. If you're not aware of your bad habits, there's no way you can fix them.”

“I wonder if I've been doing things like that with an unnatural posture? I thought I'd been living normally...“

”That's it, modern people start to stiffen up when they're still children. The 'attention' and 'front, please' they do when they start elementary school are the worst. That's when they get into the habit of standing with their backs stiff.“

”Eeek, is that so? Everyone did that!”

“That's why everyone today is so stiff. My master said, 'There are hardly any modern people who can stand properly or walk properly'.“

”Wow... how does the world look from the perspective of a master?“

”So let's start with loosening up these legs.“

”Ugh... it looks like it's going to take a while...”

<blank>

...I had a dream that felt familiar...

<blank>

A year junior to me, we were in the same team at work about seven years ago.

We got along well and hung out a lot even after the project was over.

<blank>

It seems that he was a disciple of a great master of ancient martial arts, and I often learned about martial arts from him.

I was often taken to see performances by various martial arts masters, and we spent a lot of time together outside of work.

<blank>

I was remembering these things as I dozed off in the early morning...

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, I spent the night on the riverbed by the waterfall.

<blank>

What did I do with the time after midday? It goes without saying.

<blank>

Perhaps my strength and resilience, which exceeded human understanding, were the key to opening a new door.

<blank>

Even so, spending the first night of camping in a strange place without any clothes on is not an advisable thing to do.

He woke up at dawn, as if ashamed of himself, and took a bath, but when he returned to the tent, he fidgeted around and took another bath, so he probably didn't feel too bad about it.

<blank>

The items I had with me for camping came in handy.

They were quest items in my inventory.

I wasn't able to take them out during the game, but now I can take them out and use them.

<blank>

Last night, I took out the 'one-person tent' and 'villager's blanket' that were in my inventory, as well as some animal fur, and used them.

For dinner, I tried eating the 'Mum's Salmon Stew' that I had with me, which is a recovery item (that restores a small amount of HP, etc.)... but.

<blank>

'It's really bad tasting', it seems.

Anyway, it's so bland that there's hardly any taste at all.

<blank>

There are other recovery items that look like they could be eaten, but they all have almost no taste.

<blank>

It's not that they're inedible, but they're not something you'd want to reach out and eat.

<blank>

Suzy thought she'd hold off on eating until she felt really hungry.

<blank>

<blank>

She also took some low-level equipment out of the guild warehouse.

<blank>

In the game, equipment was divided into 11 basic ranks.

<blank>

'Zero Rank' for beginners who have just started the game and have not yet chosen a job

'D/C Rank' which can be used after choosing your first job

'B/A Rank' which can be used after advancing to a specialized job

'S/SS Rank' which can be used after further advancing to a specialized type

And then there are the 'G Zero, G1, G2, G3 Ranks', which can be used by those who have transcended humanity and become divine.

<blank>

Suzie was equipped with the Nemesis Dual Sword and Oracle Heavy Armor, which are both higher-level G Zero equipment.

<blank>

But even that is, to be frank, low-level equipment in the game.

<blank>

Even so, it seems to be quite over-specced for this area.

<blank>

Suzie was now wearing A-rank equipment.

She was wearing jet-black plate armor, two swords that shone with silver, and no cape.

The swords were wide, and although they had fine decorations on the blade's belly, they were rather plain.

<blank>

“Let's see how it goes with this. Let's try it without enchantments. If it looks dangerous, we can always put the equipment back!"

<blank>

Originally, the guild warehouse stored equipment for each rank and job, in sets for use in raising sub-characters.

This time, we picked out equipment that wasn't too expensive or too cheap.

<blank>

<blank>

“The mobs that were scattered around yesterday have come back in droves today."

<blank>

I used search to check the current situation around me.

I immediately looked up to the right.

I could see a flying mob moving from the right to the left.

<blank>

“A flying mob I didn't see yesterday... a 'Gray Wyvern'. I'd estimate the distance to be about 90 meters."

<blank>

With a whoosh of spirit, he channels his ‘ki’ into his weapon.

<blank>

“This is the first shot for long-range, right? In the game, the maximum range was about 15 meters, but here I feel like I can reach it!“

<blank>

With that, he thrust out his left arm, lowered his right hand to face level, and crouched down.

He pointed the tips of his two swords at the target and shouted.

<blank>

”I'm going to take a shot at it!”

<blank>

Impact Blaster

The swordsman releases his accumulated ki and attacks a distant enemy.

This is a skill of the close-range attacker 'Duel Barbarian'.

<blank>

The shock released from the tip of the sword becomes visible, and it heads towards the target at a speed faster than sound, emitting a white light.

<blank>

The target and the white light intersect.

A moment later, it explodes and scatters.

<blank>

A dull explosion sound like something heavy bursting echoes a beat later.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

“……………Dirty fireworks.”

<blank>

I said it.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

“Conclusion! The mobs around here are weak!”

<blank>

I came to this conclusion.

<blank>

With a few beads of sweat trickling down my cheeks.

<blank>

“I guess I'll have to find a stronger opponent!“

<blank>

He put his hand over his eyes and looked around, as if searching for something in the distance.

<blank>

”All I can see is trees... Is there any higher ground around here? If I go up there, I'm sure I'll find something stronger than this...”

<blank>

He looked at the snowy mountain range that rose up to the north like a white wall and muttered to himself.

<blank>

"I wonder how high it is? Is it as high as Everest? I've never been there, so I don't know! Is it 8000 meters high? It would be nice to look down on the world from up there.”

<blank>

He put his left hand on his hip and scratched his temple with his right hand.

<blank>

“……Why don't I just jump?”

<blank>

He muttered to himself as if he had just thought of something.

<blank>

“There's no jump point, but I think I can jump up normally.”

<blank>

In the game, characters who have been 'divine' have a way of moving that allows them to fly to any location by jumping from a predetermined jump point... but there are no jump points here.

<blank>

“But you can jump, right? I haven't tried jumping with all my might yet...! The trick to enjoying games is to try things that look like they might work!“

<blank>

He bent down as if to gather strength.

<blank>

“Dooooo-seeeeee!”

<blank>

At the moment he kicked the ground, the ground caved in.

<blank>

The roots of the trees around him were pulled out of the ground, and the trees tried to fall over, but the next shock wave spread out and knocked them over forcefully.

The person who kicked up the earth with a roar was already far up in the sky.

<blank>

“Whoa, this is high, isn't it? I think I've gone up 40 or 50 meters, right?”

<blank>

In the sky, where the wind was blowing and the clouds were drifting, he looked around and was surprised at his own jumping ability.

<blank>

“I thought I'd be able to jump a couple of meters, but... what is this? Have I gone 60 meters up? This is the view from a high-rise apartment building, right? I've never climbed one before!

<blank>

Eventually, he reached the highest point of his jump and was able to see the horizon with his own eyes.

<blank>

“Wow, there's a forest all the way to the horizon except for the northern mountain range! This forest is as big as the Kanto Plain, isn't it? It's not a sea of trees, it's a sea of trees and forests! And the forest is a little thin in the south... I think?

<blank>

Eventually, his body began to descend slowly.

<blank>

“Oh? Oh? I'm falling! But! But! I'm fine, right? It's a dream, so it's fine, right? Whoa!

<blank>

She landed with a heavy thud, sending up a cloud of dust.

<blank>

“I was so surprised! I'm fine! As I thought, it was a dream! I was so scared! I'm so glad it was a dream!"

<blank>

He landed on his feet, creating a crater in the process.

After that, he got down on all fours and put his hands on the ground, and let out a heart-wrenching cry.

<blank>

<blank>

“Well, I've got a better idea of the situation around me than I thought, but what should I do now?”

<blank>

But he quickly got himself together and stood up, looking around while putting his hands on his hips.

<blank>

“I had a feeling that there were people living in the south. The theory is that if you want to progress in the game, you have to go down to the village and gather information, but there's no one stronger than me in the south. But I have a feeling that there's something in that mountain... I don't know why, but I have a feeling. Anyway, it's essential that I make the village my base, so I need to think about how I'm going to get there..."

<blank>

<blank>

I tried to think about it while folding my fingers.

<blank>

“Once we get down to the village, we'll get ready and then head for the mountains, and after exploring, we'll head back to the village.”

<blank>

“We'll head for the mountains as they are, and after exploring, we'll head for the village.”

<blank>

"Clearing the forest to create a place to live... there isn't any.”

<blank>

He crosses his arms and thinks while looking at the mountains.

<blank>

"If I'm going to the mountains, what do I need to prepare? Equipment and food to get through the forest and into the mountains? I think I can manage with the equipment I already have. As for food... if I don't go overboard... I think it would be pretty tiring to leave the forest, then go back and forth through this Juken Sea... wouldn't it?”

<blank>

He looked up towards the mountains.

<blank>

“All right, I've decided!”

<blank>

He started to move towards the north.

<blank>

“First I'll explore the mountains, then head south.”

<blank>

He put his index finger to his mouth and seemed to be thinking about something.

<blank>

“I guess I should take some water with me. I'll go to the water source and get some water... and get ready... and do a lot of things... and then... right?

<blank>

For some reason, he was slightly flushed in the cheeks as he ran off to the water source.

<blank>

"Yeah, I guess I should do that first...”

<blank>

It seems like they're going to do something first before setting off.
