# Chapter 97: The Truth of the Adventurer's Guild

To be honest, I don't remember much of what happened afterward.

I was hurriedly taken to the changing room by Meruru-san, and after finally getting my equipment ready, I went out to the street and thought I had properly finished distributing the flyers.

Well, I vaguely remember distributing the flyers. It felt like I was doing it mechanically...

According to Meruru-san, I was able to do my job properly with a smile... but my eyes lacked luster, and it was very scary to watch. Apparently...

<b>

When Bibi and Mia returned after finishing the flyer distribution, they seemed to notice that something was off with me.

They asked if something had happened, and while I omitted the details, after I spoke, both of them seemed to have their expressions fade, so they seemed to understand the gist of it.

It's mostly Arvin's fault!

After all, everyone seems to have the same perception of such cases.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Also, after that, Arvin and Davis-kun showed up at the scene with their faces all swollen, which greatly surprised the person in charge.

Well, that's only natural since it was the result of me delivering a series of rapid slaps. In other words, a back-and-forth slap!

<b>

Oh, speaking of which, I heard that Arvin invited Davis-kun to training at Amukamu...

I see, I guess I have to properly supervise them during that time. Together... heh, hehehe, ufufufu...

<b>

<b>

<b>

When everyone gathered and reported to the owner that the work was finished, we could get a signature for something called a 'Work Confirmation Certificate.'

Once we took this signed 'Confirmation Certificate' back to the Adventurer's Guild and submitted it, we would receive the payment for that work.

<b>

The owner, who signed for us, asked if we could help with flyer distribution again tomorrow, Sunday, twice in the morning and afternoon. He said he would like to have the same members if possible.

According to Selkie-san, if we complete those two shifts tomorrow, combined with today’s, it would reach the three needed for promotion, so Bibi accepted without hesitation!

Well, as long as nothing like today happens, I don't really have a reason to refuse.

<b>

By the way, the shop is a tea house called 'The Big Front Yard,' and this week they are holding an event for their 10th anniversary, so the flyer distribution is for that promotion.

I only learned that the owner's name is Donald Seamack when I got the signature.

He seemed so busy that he even forgot to introduce himself when I greeted him before work, and I thought it was great that I could help out in this way.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finally finishing the work, when I returned to the Adventurer's Guild, I was greatly surprised to be welcomed by an unexpected person.

<b>

"Thank you for your hard work. It's nice to see you again, Lady Cloud. How was your first job?"

"Ah! Onee-chan! Uh, I'm back now."

<b>

As soon as Meruru-san saw that person's face, she exclaimed "Onee-chan."

That's right, the person there was Ku Emel-san, Meruru-san's older sister, who had taken care of us during the carriage trip from Amukamu!!

<b>

But I was sure she had said she was the manager of Roderick-san's trading company...

Why is she here, behind the reception counter of the Adventurer's Guild? 

<b>

"Ku Emel-san?! What are you doing here?!!"

"Hehe, well, I am the manager here, so it's only natural for me to be present..."

"Eh? But you're the manager at Roderick-san's place, right? ...This is the Adventurer's Guild, right?"

"That's right. This 'Northmiliya Adventurer's Guild' is one of the branches of our 'Northmiliya Trading Group.'"

"Huh?"

<b>

I answered with a strange voice... but wait? A branch of a trading company? Huh? Did I mishear?

<b>

"Eh? ...So the trading company arranges jobs for adventurers...?"

"Yes, that's correct. We refer to them as our members."

"Um, um, the 'Adventurer's Guild' is supposed to introduce jobs to adventurers seeking work, right?"

"That's right. We introduce suitable jobs to our members seeking work."

<b>

Huh? Wait? Is that really still the Adventurer's Guild...? It can't be... right? I'm not mistaken, am I? 

<b>

"Eh? Ah, um, so, at first, beginners start with gathering herbs or collecting materials, right?"

"Gathering materials...? It depends on the items, but jobs requiring specialized knowledge would be difficult for amateurs..."

"Uh, um, um, and then, once they level up a bit, they would be adventurers who hunt wolves that trouble the village, right?"

"Yes? Pest control? No, no! Dealing with such dangerous creatures is absolutely impossible for amateurs! ...That would be a case for specialists!"

<b>

As expected, they are not from Amukamu... and I was told such things!

Huh? Why does it feel like I'm being told something extremely obvious?

Ku Emel-san is responding to my inquiries with a troubled look on her face...

Huh? It feels like our conversation is really not aligning at all?!

<b>

I felt a subtle misunderstanding in our communication, but Ku Emel-san continued speaking.

<b>

"Our 'Northmiliya Adventurer's Guild' is a staffing company that connects those seeking work with those looking for talent."

<b>

Staffing? Did she just say staffing? Why is a term I feel like I've heard in my original world coming up here?!

Why?! Huh?! But they are adventurers, right? They are saying it's the Adventurer's Guild, right?!!

Seeing my confusion, Ku Emel-san patiently explained various things to me.

<b>

"First of all, there is no profession called 'adventurer' as you describe. The name 'adventurer' in our company name was given when we were founded."

"When it was founded, huh?"

"Yes, actually, our headquarters, 'Northmiliya Trading Company,' is a long-established company approaching its 200th anniversary..."

"Two hundred years...? That's amazing..."

"I appreciate it. And it is said that this 'Northmiliya Adventurer's Guild' was established around the same time. It seems that our relationship with your academy dates back to that period."

"Is that so?"

"Yes, as it continues today, students have been doing selected jobs from our company since then, learning the value of labor while contributing to society with their own abilities."

<b>

I see, the reason Colin was able to get the outing permission that normally takes time to approve is because of this.

Working at the Adventurer's Guild is recognized by the academy as part of social studies and volunteer activities.

This means that the Adventurer's Guild introduces jobs that have been vetted in advance, ensuring there are no issues for students. On the company side, a trust relationship has been established over the years, allowing them to obtain reliable and earnest workers.

<b>

"Perhaps the founder wanted the students to explore and learn about the world outside the academy with a sense of adventure, which is why the name 'adventurer' was chosen?"

<b>

Ku Emel-san concluded her explanation like that.

Ah, I just realized something!

This is definitely the work of the hero! There's no doubt that the hero is involved behind the scenes!!

Is this some kind of trap set up by the hero?!

Naming it 'Adventurer's Guild' feels rather calculated, doesn't it?!

<b>

I thought it was the classic 'Adventurer's Guild' from another world, but it turns out to be a company that introduces day labor jobs from my previous world!!

No! I feel like there’s no difference in the system, though!

I was the only one who misunderstood this!

Well, I guess I'm the only one who would do that!

Ah! What is this frustration and embarrassment with nowhere to go?!

<b>

And! I feel this overwhelming fatigue throughout my body...

<b>

"..........I'm tired. I feel especially exhausted today..."

<b>

My shoulders drooped visibly to those around me.

And then, Bibi gently placed her hand on my fallen shoulder.

When I turned to look at Bibi, she nodded kindly as if to say, "Good job."

Ugh, right now, that small kindness really touches my heart... ah!

<b>

Seeing my dejected state, Ku Emel-san asked, "Is something wrong?" and Bibi quickly explained the chaos at the job site.

After hearing Bibi's story, Ku Emel-san glared at Meruru-san with a fierce look. At that moment, if I wasn't imagining things, I felt like I saw an onomatopoeic sound effect of "Gogogogo..." behind her!

And at that moment, Meruru-san's cat ears flattened down, and her fur stood on end, clearly visible to those around her.

<b>

"Meruru? I asked you to take good care of the 'young lady,' didn't I?"

"Uh, um, no, it's not like that, Emel Onee-chan! It was an accident..."

"Enough, come here for a moment... Young lady, I sincerely apologize. I will take my leave now. Please continue to associate with us in the future."

<b>

Saying that, Ku Emel-san bowed deeply and then grabbed Meruru-san by the scruff of her neck, quietly disappearing into the back office.

Meruru-san, being taken away like that, had tears in her eyes and looked at me as if seeking help... but I won't feel sorry for her, okay?

<b>

As Selkie-san watched Meruru-san leave, she said with a refreshing smile, "Make sure to get a proper scolding."

Could it be that Meruru-san is usually like this? If that's the case, I might need to reconsider how to interact with her in the future...

Mainly in terms of physical distance!!

<b>

In the end, on the following Sunday, I finished distributing flyers in the morning with Mia and in the afternoon with Karen-san.

After completing the two shifts of flyer distribution, the owner, Seamack-san, asked if we could continue working as servers.

He seemed to be quite pleased with us and insisted on it.

Indeed, Mia's customer attraction rate is high. Even while distributing flyers, the guys were really interested in her!

However, I had never worked as a waitress before, and I wasn't confident I could do it well. Even when I tried to decline, he insisted that there would be no problem as he would provide thorough guidance.

<b>

However, Selkie-san reminded me that the condition for promotion to D rank is "10 days of work within three months," which means I need to work a total of 80 hours, or 8 hours a day for 10 days.

<b>

"So, if I work a full day on weekends and 2 hours on weekdays, I can meet the conditions in as little as a month, or at least two months."

<b>

Bibi immediately jumped at that explanation and decided to accept the job right away.

Well, we are new students, and we still don't know how the class schedule will go, so it might be impossible to work every day, but if it's just on the days we can...

Even so, Seamack-san was overjoyed.

<b>

"It's a stroke of luck to be able to get promoted in less than two months!"

<b>

Bibi seemed satisfied.

Indeed, having work confirmed in advance is helpful.

Karen-san also said, "Being able to work every day is a great help!" which was a bit surprising, but if everyone is satisfied, then that's good.

<b>

And so, we were able to successfully promote to E rank that day.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

And then came Monday, the start of the new week.

In our dorm room, we checked each other's uniforms for any disarray.

<b>

"Well then, shall we go, Karen..."

"Yeah, Su...chan."

<b>

We both noticed that we were still a bit hesitant in calling each other by our names, and when our eyes met, we couldn't help but giggle together.

I took her hand and opened the door with the other hand, stepping outside together.

<b>

After working together yesterday, I felt that our distance had shortened quite a bit, and after finishing work, I had asked her to call me by my name.

At first, Karen-san seemed a bit flustered by my suggestion, but in the end, she nodded with a blush, as if shy.

<b>

With that, even though it took a week, I finally felt like I had gotten closer to Karen, and I was able to welcome the start of the week with a good feeling.

<b>

<b>

We had breakfast together in the cafeteria, and while enjoying coffee afterward, Bibi and Mia arrived a bit late.

I could have waited for them, but since Bibi said it was fine for me to go ahead, I decided to head to the main school building with Karen first, leaving the two behind.

<b>

As we walked down the hallway, I talked with Karen about the restaurant from yesterday. We had talked about it last night, but we still had more to say!

The interior of the restaurant, which I saw later, was even prettier and cuter than I had imagined. The chiffon cake we tasted after work was truly exquisite, just as Meruru-san had said, and everyone became a fan after just one bite. There were so many topics to discuss.

Most importantly, I was just so happy to have common topics with Karen like this.

<b>

The long hallway leading to the classroom turned into a really enjoyable time.

I hope Karen feels the same way and is enjoying this time with me...

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was supposed to be such a fun time.

Yet, for some reason, just before we arrived at the classroom, a tense atmosphere began to drift in.

<b>

There were two groups of girls facing off against each other, each consisting of three members glaring at each other... or so it seemed?

The surrounding students were also clearly watching the two groups with bated breath.

<b>

I recognized the three girls who had their backs to us. They were from the third group that barged into our class on the day of the entrance ceremony.

Those blonde ringlets were unmistakable from behind! It was Lady Cordelia Casper and her two attendants.

<b>

As for the other group... I think I've seen that girl in the center before? She was the one who said she was close to the second son of the Nivun family, whom I saw in the cafeteria over the weekend.

The name Anna Marie told me back then was, if I remember correctly, Ruuri Dito-san... right?

<b>

Now, it seemed like sparks were flying between those two groups.

Ugh, this feels ominous.

It was supposed to be a pleasant start to the week... I really want this atmosphere to go away.
