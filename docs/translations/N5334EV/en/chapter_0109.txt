# 97 The Truth About the Adventurers' Union

What happened after that I actually don't remember very well.

Merle hurriedly took me to the changing room, and this time, after I was fully equipped, I went out to the street out front, and I think I finished handing out the flyers in a crisp and solid manner.

Well, I vaguely remember them handing out flyers. I feel like I was handing them out mechanically. ......

Merle told me that he was smiling and doing his job properly...... but there was no luster in his eyes and he was very scary to look at. It seems that .......

<blank>

Bibi and Mia also seemed to notice that I was acting strangely when they came back from distributing flyers.

They asked me what was wrong, and I left out the details, but after I told them, both of their expressions disappeared, so they generally seemed to understand.

Mostly Irving's fault!

After all, everyone has the same perception of these cases.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Also, Irving and Mr. Davis arrived at the scene afterwards with their faces swollen to the max, much to the surprise of those in charge.

Well, that's because I gave him a series of high-speed slaps, in other words, a back-and-forth slap! I slapped him back and forth, so it was only natural that I did!

<blank>

Oh, by the way, Irving told me that he invited Mr. Davis to train at Amcam. ......

Oh well, I guess I'll have to attend to them properly and politely then, the two of us together ...... ugh, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm .............

Once everyone is together and reports to the owner that the work has been completed, he will sign a "business confirmation".

Once you have this signed "certificate of confirmation," you take it back to the Adventurers' Guild and submit it, and you will be paid for the work you did.

<blank>

The owner who signed up for the event has asked us to hand out flyers twice tomorrow Sunday, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He asked if we could have the same members again tomorrow, if possible. He asked me.

According to Mr. Selkie, if he completed the two sessions tomorrow, he would have three sessions for promotion, including today's. Bibi didn't hesitate! So, Bibi did not need to hesitate!

Well, it's okay with me, too, because I wouldn't have any particular reason to refuse if it weren't for what happened today.

<blank>

The store is a tea house called "Big Vestibule," and this week they are holding an event to celebrate their 10th anniversary, and the flyers they are passing out are for advertising purposes.

I also learned for the first time that the owner's name is Donald Siemack when I received his autograph.

When I greeted him before work, he seemed so busy that he forgot to say his name, and I was more than happy to help him with something like this.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I finally finished my work and returned to the Adventurers' Guild, I was surprised to be greeted by an unexpected person.

<blank>

'Thanks for your time. Nice to see you again, Miss Cloud. How was your first job?"

Oh! Sis! Ah, ...... I'm back."

<blank>

When Merle saw the person's face, he said, 'Sis.

Yes, there she was, Cu Emel, Merle's sister who is with us now and who helped us on the carriage trip from Amkam!

<blank>

But I believe you said you were the manager of Mr. Roderick's trading company. ......

Is that person somehow now on the other side of the reception counter at the Adventurers' Guild?

<blank>

"Mr. Cu Emel? What are you doing here?

'Hmm, because I'm the manager here, so it's only natural that I'm here. ......

Huh?" But I'm the manager at Roderick's place, right? ...... is the Adventurers' Guild, right?"

Yes, that's right. The Northmiriya Adventurers' Guild is a member of the Northmiriya Chamber of Commerce Group.

Huh?"

<blank>

I answered in a kind of funny voice: ...... but, what? Is it part of the Chamber of Commerce? Hm? Did I mishear you?

<blank>

What? ......, the Chamber of Commerce is a job placement agency for adventurers, and you are ......?"

?" Yes, that's right. You are an adventurer, or rather, a member of our company."

"Well, uh, we're the Adventurers' Guild, and we introduce jobs to adventurers who are looking for work, right?"

Yes, we are a company that introduces our members who are seeking work to jobs that are right for them."

<blank>

Hmm? Hm? Huh? That's still the Adventurers' Union, right ......? Huh? It's not ......, right? It's not wrong, right? Huh?

<blank>

What? Uh, well, you are an adventurer who starts out by gathering medicinal herbs and other materials, right?

Are you a material collector ......? I guess it depends on the thing, but I think it's hard for amateurs to do work that requires expertise. ......"

"Oh, you know, uh, when you get a little higher level, you'll be an adventurer who kills wolves and stuff that bothers the village, right?"

Yes? Vermin extermination? No, no, no! It is impossible for an amateur to deal with such dangerous creatures! ......That's exactly the kind of thing we leave to the experts, isn't it?"

<blank>

They are indeed not the Amcam people and ...... and that's what they told me!

Huh? What's that, something blindingly obvious?

Cu Emel is also responding to my questions, lowering his eyebrows as if he were troubled, and .......

Huh? I'm starting to feel like we're not really on the same page here, you know?

<blank>

I feel a slight miscommunication in communication. ......, Cu Emel also said, and was able to continue his words.

<blank>

We, the Northmiriya Adventurers Guild, are a staffing agency that connects people who are looking for work with people who are looking for talent.

<blank>

Dispatch? Did you say staffing? Why is there such a noun here that I've heard of in the original world?

Why? What? Because we are adventurers, right? You say you're an adventurer's union, right?

Perhaps seeing my confusion, Cu Emel politely and patiently explained everything to me.

<blank>

First of all, there is no such thing as an "adventurer" as you call it. The name 'adventurer' in the company's trade name was given to the company when it was founded.

At the time of the founding?"

Yes, in fact, our head office, "North Military Trading Company," is a long-established company that is approaching its 200th year in business. ......

"Two, two hundred and one hundred years......200 years...that's ...... amazing!"

I am sorry. It is said that the North Military Adventurers Association was founded at about the same time as your academy. It is said that the association was founded around the same time as the founding of your academy, and that the relationship between the two associations dates back to that time.

Was it?"

Yes, as it continues to this day, our students have been working in our selected jobs since then, learning the value of work and using their abilities to contribute to society.

<blank>

I see, this is the reason why Colin was able to get a permit right away, even though it would have normally taken a long time for the application to be approved.

Working for the Adventurers' Guild is part of my social studies and service, and it's recognized by the academy.

From the school's side, the Adventurers' Guild scrutinizes the work in advance and introduces students to projects that are safe for them to work on. From the company's side, there is a long-established relationship of trust that ensures we get people who are sure of their identities and who will be sincerely engaged in their work.

<blank>

Perhaps the founders named their students "adventurers" to encourage them to explore and learn about the world outside the academy.

<blank>

Cu Emel was able to strangle the story in such a way.

Oh, that's it!

It's the work of a brave man again! It's definitely the one with a brave man behind it!

Is this some kind of trap set by a brave man?

Isn't it kind of a mockery that they went to the trouble of naming it "The Adventurers' Guild" or something like that?

<blank>

I thought it was the "Adventurers' Guild" of the otherworldly world, but it turned out to be a company that introduced daily-paid part-time jobs, which also existed in the previous world!

No, I don't think there is any difference in the system! I don't think there is any difference in the system!

I was the one who misunderstood!

I'm the only one who would do it!

Oh! What's this feeling of unaccountable indignation and shame!

<blank>

And! This general feeling of fatigue that I feel so intensely .......

<blank>

"............ tired, something I'm terribly tired of today ......"

<blank>

My shoulder falls with a jerk that is obvious even to the casual observer.

Then, Bibi gently put his hand on his fallen shoulder from the side.

I turned my head and looked at Bibi, who nodded kindly as if to say, 'Good work.

Ugh, that little kindness is so wearing on me right now. ...... Aww!

<blank>

When Cu Emel saw how dented I was, he asked, "What's wrong? Bibi gave me a brief explanation of what had been going on at work.

When Mr. Cu Emel heard Bibi's story, Ginulo! and glared at Mr. Merle. At that time, if I'm not imagining it, I thought I saw a sound effect-like drawing of the words 'gogogo ......' behind him, you know?

At that moment, Meruru-san's bed hair closed up, and the hairs stood up in a way that even the casual observer could see! The hairs stood up in the air.

<blank>

'Merle? I asked you to 'take good care of the young lady,' didn't I?"

Oh, um, no, sister Emel! This was an accident. ......"

Come here for a minute. ......Madam, I am very sorry, I must leave you for today. I hope that you will continue to stay with me in the future."

<blank>

After saying this, Cu Emelu bowed deeply, picked Merle up by the neck, and quietly disappeared into the back of the office.

Merle, who was being donated to the hospital, had quite teary eyes and looked at me as if he was asking for help. ...... I don't feel sorry for him, you know?

<blank>

Mr. Selkie, who was seeing Mr. Merle off, said with a fresh smile, "You should go and get scolded properly.

Is Merle, by any chance, the kind of person who is usually like this? If so, I may have to think a little bit about the distance between us going out in the future. ......

Mainly, in physical distance!

I ended up working with Mia in the morning and Karen in the afternoon to finish the flyer distribution the following Sunday.

After the two flyers had been handed out, the owner, Seamac, asked me if I would like to continue all of them and serve as a waiter as well. He asked me.

They seemed to like it very much and asked for it by all means.

It's true that Mia attracts a lot of customers! When I was handing out flyers, the guys were really into it!

But I've never waitressed before and I'm not sure I can do it well. I tried to refuse, but she insisted that there would be no problem because she would give me detailed instructions! They still insist that they will guide me carefully.

<blank>

However, Mr. Selkie told me again that the condition for promotion to rank D, "10 days of work within 3 months," can be met by working 8 hours a day for 10 days, or 80 hours in total.

<blank>

So, if you work every day of the week at a rate of two hours a day, with a full day off, you'll have conditions in place in as early as a month, or at least two months."

<blank>

Bibi bit on that explanation and decided to take the job as soon as possible.

Well, we are new students, and we don't know how school classes are going to progress yet, so I'm not sure we'll be able to do it every day, but just on the days we can get out, ......, that's the deal.

Still, Mr. Cimac was overjoyed.

<blank>

It's fortuitous that it takes less than two months to get promoted!"

<blank>

And Bibi is satisfied.

Certainly it helps to have the job confirmed in advance.

Karen also said, "It's very helpful to be allowed to work every day!" It was a little surprising that she was so enthusiastic about it, but I guess it was good if everyone was satisfied.

<blank>

And so we were successfully promoted to the rank of "E" that day.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Then, the week began on Monday.

In my room at the dormitory, we check each other's uniforms to make sure they are in order.

<blank>

Let's go then, Karen. ......

Yeah, Sue ......-chan."

<blank>

I noticed that we were still calling each other's names a little, reservedly, and when our eyes met, we both giggled unintentionally.

I took her hand in mine, opened the door with my other hand, and we stepped out of the room together.

<blank>

Yesterday, I had asked her to call me by my name after work, as I felt that we had grown closer to each other through our work together.

At first Karen seemed puzzled by my suggestion, but in the end she shook her head, her cheeks tinted with a hint of embarrassment.

<blank>

It took me a week, but now that I finally feel comfortable with Karen, I feel good about the beginning of the week.

<blank>

<blank>

While they were having breakfast and after-dinner coffee in the dining hall, Bibi and Mia arrived late.

I could have waited, but Bibi said I could go ahead, so I decided to leave them and go with Karen first to the main school building where the classrooms were located.

<blank>

As we walked down the hallway, Karen and I talked about yesterday's store. We had talked about it last night, but neither of us had talked about it yet!

I was later shown the store, which was even more beautiful and prettier than I had expected. After work, we were allowed to sample the chiffon cake, which, as Merle said, was truly exquisite, and we all became fans after just one bite. Anyway, there are plenty of stories to tell.

And most of all, I was just happy to have something in common with Karen like this.

<blank>

The long hallway to the classroom was really a fun time.

I hope Karen is enjoying this time as much as I am. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was supposed to be such a fun time.

And yet, for some reason, just before arriving at the classroom, an unusually tense atmosphere was brewing.

<blank>

There they were, two sets of girls facing each other. Three of each, staring at each other.......?

I could clearly see that the students around me were also watching the two groups with bated breath.

<blank>

I remember the three who are showing their backs to us. They are the three from Class 3 who came to our class on the day of the entrance ceremony.

There is no mistaking that gold pa vertical roll from behind! It's Miss Cordilia Casper and her two attendants.

<blank>

The other pair to that is ...... have you seen the kid in the center of that one? I saw her at the diner on the weekend, the one who said she was close to the second son of the Niven family, you know.

I think the name that AnnaMarie gave me at that time was Lurie Diet, ......?

<blank>

Now, it was as if sparks were flying between the two groups! It was as if sparks were flying between the two groups.

Hmmm, something is disturbing.

It was a nice way to start the week, but ......, I don't want this airing out.
