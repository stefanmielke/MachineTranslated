# 91 First Weekend

Today is the first weekend since we entered Milia Castel Eye.

<blank>

In this country, as in the original world, there are seven days in a week and days of the week.

The days of the week correspond to each of the seven goddesses of this world.

<blank>

I'm told that this defining thing of the day of the week was created about 200 years ago, so this is definitely a "heroic act"!

<blank>

Today is Saturday in the original world, the day of "Umr of Shadows".

Since there is no weekly holiday in this country, everyone is working except on the day of the "yang terir," which is the first day off of the week.

The world is not closed on the weekend of "Umr of Shadows," but school classes end in the morning.

In short, it is what used to be called "han-don" in the original world!

<blank>

So after the morning classes were over, we all went to the school's main cafeteria for lunch.

This large dining hall is located between the school building and the dormitories and is one of the most important facilities that feeds the stomachs of the entire school!

It is easy to imagine that the inside of the kitchen must be a veritable battlefield, as 300 young teenagers are confronted with their appetites at mealtime.

After all, this diner has an extensive menu!

The menu ranges from light breakfast items such as toast, coffee, and fruit to full-course dinners that look like they belong to a noble family! The menu ranges from light breakfast items such as toast, coffee, and fruit, to a full course dinner that would make any aristocrat proud!

And ......, no matter how you look at it, "Donburi" ....... Beef bowl, pork cutlet bowl, tempura bowl, seafood bowl! There are even things like that, obviously there is a brave man behind this as well!

Well, I'm happy for me!

<blank>

We all had lunch together in such a cafeteria.

By "everyone," I mean the men of AMCAM.

In addition to the five of us freshmen, there are sophomores Colin, Dana, and Willie, and juniors Kara, Alicia, Jessica, and Arrows. And then there are the third-year students, Kara, Alicia, Jessica, and Arrows.

Victor is the only one who is not there. He says he is very busy at lunch time. Ummm, I won't ask too deeply.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Today we're going to the Adventurers' Guild!"

Hohi?"

<blank>

And so it was when I was getting chocolate bavarois for dessert after lunch.

As I was enjoying the lingering sweetness of the rich milk chocolate melting in my mouth with my hand on my cheek with the spoon still in my mouth, Bibi suddenly said something like that.

I think it's understandable if I answered in a funny voice, don't you?

<blank>

......Because it's the Adventurers Guild! ...... Adventurers' Guild!

There are adventurers in this world? There are adventurers in this world! There was an adventurers' union? I had no idea!

<blank>

You know what I'm talking about, right? Adventurers" are the ones who defeat monsters and have ranks, and they are a staple of otherworldly stories!

I had always thought that was the position of the AMCAM Protectorate!

<blank>

So there was! There is an Adventurers' Union separate from AMCAM!

I'm getting excited!

<blank>

Is that what I think it is? The one where you go to register, and some old, bad-behaved person starts a row with you, and you quickly get rid of him, and then you pass the registration exam by a landslide, and the atmosphere is like, "He's not a normal guy. ......

I wonder if this is the same story that I've been promised? I wonder if it is? Hmmm!

<blank>

No, ............ no no no no! Chill out, yourself! What are you doing standing out!

Have you forgotten how you've been so discreet and quiet all this time?

No, no, no! Adventurers' Union Kiken! Adventurers are in trouble! I have a strong feeling that our risk index is about to reach dangerous territory!

<blank>

Ahhhhhh ......, but hey, I'd love to visit the Adventurers Guild....

It's a speciality of another world! It's not much of a choice if you don't even go to see it!

Besides, you still want to register anyway, don't you?

Hmmm, I wonder what we can do about it. ......

<blank>

"Well, that's good, isn't it? It's not a bad idea to go when you can and register early."

Come to think of it, we went on our first vacation, too.

All the AmCam people sign up early."

<blank>

Colin, Carla, and Jessica are saying that.

Hmmm, I see that ...... and all AmCam people are registered .......

I guess I can't just refrain from doing that, can I? ......

<blank>

...... No! Yes, let's do it this way! Let's have Irving take care of all these promises!

After all, the Haggards are heroes, aren't they? I'm sure they'll recover these flags, right?

I should just stand back and watch from the back and say, "My child is so strong, isn't she? I think it would be better if I just watch over them from behind with a guardian's stance, saying, "My child is so strong!

Yes, that's it! That's exactly the position I want to be in! Just watch from the side! I can enjoy these things because it's someone else's business! Right?

All right, all right! Let's make sure Irving does his job as a hero!

Hang in there for me Irving! Uhi!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Is Mia okay?

I'm totally fine with it! I'm totally fine, right?"

If it looks too tough, we can go another time, okay?"

"Unh? I'm fine, Bibi."

...... Well, good then!"

<blank>

Mia used a spoon gracefully with her bandaged hand to scoop up a scoop of milk bavarois, which she then brought to her mouth, and answered Bibi's question with a smile that seemed to melt in her mouth.

Bibi is also concerned about Mia, but if she says there is no problem, he is not going to say anything more.

<blank>

Today is the fifth day since I carved my spiritual seal and learned magic directly for the first time.

The outburst of magic leaves burn-like damage to a person's skin.

Mia seems to have been training every day since then to control her magic, but the bandages on her hands were increasing every day.

When we ask her if she can help us in any way, she smiles and dismisses our offer. When we asked Mia if she could help us in any way, she would simply dismiss our offer, smiling and laughing every day.

<blank>

Bibi and I could only look at each other and shrug our shoulders.

Nothing you can say to Mia at a time like this is good enough. The only thing to do is to let her do it until she is satisfied.

<blank>

'Well, we're all heading to the Adventurers' Guild later today! Okay?

I'll get you your furlough.

'Wait Arrows, I'll go with you. I had to go to the student council office anyway. ....... I can be there in less than half an hour to bring it in, and you can all have your tea here until then.

Thank you, Arrows, Colin. I'll get another ...... of the bavarois then anyway, I guess?"

It's Bavarois Day, so we have all kinds of different styles of Bavarois! Here you go! Don't you just love this strawberry bavarois with all this pulp on it, Sue? Here, here, here! Mmmm, mmm, mmm!"

<blank>

I was about to get up from my seat with a smile on my face to have another bavarois when Carla scooped up a bavarois with strawberries on it with a spoon and held it out in front of me.

For a moment, just a moment, I hesitated.

I mean, she's a lady now, right? It's not a very vulgar thing for a little girl to bite into a spoon that is held out in front of her with her mouth wide open, is it?

I guess Kara thinks I'll just bite right into the good stuff now like I did back in the day at Amcam! It doesn't work that way! It's not going to happen!

But I don't hesitate ...... to think about it, the jelly shining like rubies shaking in front of my eyes, the lovely piece of strawberry that seems to be waiting for me in it, and the bavarois body swaying on the plump light cherry blossom as a base to support it! Oh, ...... I resent the colorful glamour of it all.

......Yes, the hesitation was momentary!

Because! Because the next thing I knew, I was snapping at the spoon that Carla had offered me!

<blank>

The bavarois immediately melted in your mouth, and the flavor of the strawberries kneaded into the bavarois overflowed. The jelly on top of the bavarois crumbles when your teeth hit it, and the juice filled with the gentle sourness of the strawberries along with the pulp inside spreads all over your mouth!

Ah, the enchanting strawberry bavarois. ......

<blank>

I put my hands on my cheeks and let myself fall into this blissful moment, shaking my face.

<blank>

How's it taste? Tasty, isn't it? Sue?"

"...... and ...... are the best...ever."

<blank>

I finally answered Kara's question with just that.

And what follows is a raging spoon attack!

<blank>

Sue! I'll raise mine! Here! Make me cum."

"Before I go get my ...... permit, I might as well go up and ....... Here you go, Sue, this orange bavarois is delicious, too, don't you think?"

"Soo, Soo! This milk bavarois is the best, right? Yes, I do! Ahhh!"

Atashi's too, Sue! Ahhhh, ahhh!"

<blank>

Jessica, Colin, Mia, Alicia, and Alicia all stick out their spoons one after the other.

And in my mouth, happiness exploded one after another.

The flavor of marron! The orange jam! The richness of milk! The freshness of lemon!

Ahh! Bliss! Bliss! Bliss!

I will go squishy with my hands on my cheeks!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh? Speaking of which! Where did Irving go?

Irving would have gone out for a nap as soon as he finished his meal.

'Hah ......, God damn it! I can't help it!"

<blank>

Bibi, who had been watching me being fed by everyone with a sideways glance of dismay, suddenly noticed Irving's absence and spoke up.

<blank>

Yeah, Irving shoveled down his lunch of "soupy beef bowl" with great gusto and left the cafeteria in a hurry. ......

Also, Dana used to leave with her tots when she finished eating.

I remember Dana went out happily, saying that she had an appointment to meet him with a spear.

Well, Dana is not going to the "Adventurers' Guild" with us, so that's fine!

<blank>

What are you going to do? Do we leave Irving alone? Or should I apply for a furlough for him, just in case?"

I should have told you in advance, ......! My mistake!"

<blank>

Well, even Bibi wouldn't expect Irving to disappear so quickly right after lunch.

Bibi is down in the dumps, so I'm going to go look for him.

You don't think you're flagging Nampa ...... or something in this short amount of time, do you? It's just a stone, isn't it ......?

Seriously! The Haggards are heroes, and we want them to be very careful and self-aware! It's not uncommon for unexpected actions to get you in trouble!

<blank>

"............ Huh? Irving, are you on your way to Koch?"

What? Really? Sue! Where are you?

We're already there. We'll be at the entrance to the cafeteria soon.

<blank>

What happened to napping? Did he stop? I can't believe he's coming back so soon. ...... Hmmm, what's going on?

I mean, ...... what is that? Are they walking together? Does that mean Irving is bringing her?

Why? Huh? What?

<blank>

Eventually, they passed through the entrance and Irving returned to the dining room in a shillelagh-like manner.

He immediately saw that we were there and walked straight to us.

And his companion followed him, picking at the sleeves of Irving's shirt and looking around, as if he were hiding behind Irving's back.

<blank>

Everyone who saw it, ......, froze.

"You've done it, you son of a bitch."

I am sure everyone's hearts must have been in beautiful unison with these lines!

I'm a little too scared to see what Bibi looks like now. ......

I can tell that a highly concentrated aura of anger is leaking out and overflowing.

That's why it's so scary!

<blank>

"Susie, I need you to do a little favor for this girl, okay?"

<blank>

Irving, without reading the tense atmosphere, approached me.

Karen Merlin, who is also my roommate, looked out from behind Irving's back and bowed deeply to me with a blush on her cheeks.
