# Chapter 91: The First Weekend

Today marks the first weekend since we enrolled in Miria Castle Eye.

<b>

Just like in the original world, this country has a week consisting of seven days and names for those days.

It is said that the days correspond to the seven pillar goddesses of this world.

<b>

The definition of these days was supposedly established about 200 years ago, so this is undoubtedly the work of the "Hero"!

<b>

So today is the day that corresponds to Saturday in the original world, "Shadow Umuru."

This country does not have a two-day weekend, so everyone works on all days except for the weekly holiday, "Sunshine Teriru."

Even though "Shadow Umuru," the weekend, is not a holiday for society, school classes end in the morning.

In other words, it's like the "half-day" that was used in the original world!

<b>

With that said, after the morning classes ended, we all had lunch together in the school's large cafeteria.

By "everyone," I mean the members of Amukamu.

In addition to the five of us new students, there are second-year students Colin, Dana, and Willy. Then there are third-year students Carla, Alicia, Jessica, and Arrows.

Only Victor is absent. Apparently, he is very busy during lunchtime. Hmm, I won't pry further.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Today, we're going to the Adventurers' Guild!"

"Huh?"

<b>

So, while I was enjoying chocolate Bavarian cream for dessert after lunch, I absentmindedly placed my hand on my cheek with a spoon in my mouth, savoring the lingering sweetness of rich milk chocolate when Bibi suddenly said that.

I think it's understandable that I responded with a strange voice, right?!

<b>

...Because, it's the Adventurers' Guild, right? ...The Adventurers' Guild!

Are there adventurers in this world too? Is there an Adventurers' Guild?! I had no idea at all?! 

<b>

You know? When you say "adventurer," it usually involves defeating monsters and having ranks, and it's a staple in otherworldly stories!!

I thought for sure that the Amukamu Protection Corps held that position?!

<b>

So it exists! An Adventurers' Guild separate from Amukamu!!

I can feel my excitement gradually rising!

<b>

Is it going to be like this? You go to register and get picked on by some troublesome veterans, and then you quickly deal with that, and ace the registration exam, creating an atmosphere of "this person is no ordinary individual"?!

Is this the flow where such a classic trope unfolds? I wonder?! Hehe!

<b>

No, ...no, no, no! Calm down, self! What good does it do to stand out?!!

Have you forgotten how you've managed to live quietly without drawing attention until now?!!

No, no! The Adventurers' Guild is dangerous! Adventurers are risky!! I have a strong feeling that my propensity for trouble is about to reach a dangerous level!!

<b>

Ahhh... but still, I want to see the Adventurers' Guild.

It's a famous feature of this other world! Not going to see it would be too much!

And if possible, I want to register, right?

Hmm... I wonder if there's a way to make that happen...

<b>

"Well, I think it's a good idea. It wouldn't be bad to go while we can and register early."

"Speaking of which, we went during our first break too."

"Everyone from Amukamu registers early."

<b>

Colin, Carla, and Jessica said that.

Hmm, is that so...? Everyone from Amukamu registers...

Then I can't just hold back, can I?

<b>

...No! That's it! I'll have Arvin take care of all these obligations!!

After all, the Haggard family members are heroes, right? They will definitely handle such flags properly, right?

I can just watch from behind, thinking, "My child is strong, isn't he? Hohohoho," right?!

That's it! That's the position I want! I can just watch from the sidelines! I can enjoy this because it's someone else's affair! Right?!

Alright! I’ll make sure Arvin does his job as a hero!

Do your best for me, Arvin!! Hehe!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Are you okay, Mia?!"

"Yeah! I'm totally fine!"

"If it seems tough, we can always go next time."

"Uh-huh? I'm fine, Bibi-chan."

"…Well, that's good!"

<b>

Mia elegantly used her spoon with her bandaged hand, bringing the milk Bavarian cream she scooped up to her mouth, answering Bibi's question with a melting smile.

Bibi is concerned about Mia, but since she says she's fine, it seems she has no intention of saying anything more.

<b>

Today marks the fifth day since I engraved the spirit seal and learned magic directly for the first time.

The explosive release of magical power leaves burn-like damage on human skin.

It seems Mia has been training daily for magic control since then, but the bandages on her hands have been increasing day by day.

Whenever I ask if there's anything I can help with, Mia always cheerfully smiles and gently declines our offers, saying she's fine.

<b>

Bibi and I could only exchange glances and shrug our shoulders.

There's no point in saying anything to Mia at times like this. We can only let her do it until she's satisfied.

<b>

"Alright, everyone, we're heading to the Adventurers' Guild after this! Got it?!"

"Then I'll go get the permission slip."

"Wait, Arrows, I'm going too. I had business in the student council room anyway... It’ll be quicker to handle the paperwork if I'm there, right? I can bring it back in less than 30 minutes, so everyone can just have tea here until then."

"Thanks, Arrows, Colin. ...Then since we're at it, I think I'll get a second helping of Bavarian cream... maybe?"

"Today is Bavarian cream day, so there are all kinds of styles and flavors! Look! This strawberry Bavarian cream with chunks of fruit on top, don't you love it, Sue? Come on, open wide, ahhh!"

<b>

As I stood up, grinning to get another Bavarian cream, Carla scooped up the strawberry Bavarian cream with her spoon and held it out in front of me.

For a brief moment, I hesitated.

After all, I’m already a proper lady, right? Isn’t it rather unbecoming to open my mouth wide and bite into a spoon held out like that by a little child?!

Carla probably thinks I’ll immediately dive into delicious food like I used to in Amukamu! But that won’t work?! It won’t work at all!!

However, such hesitation... was only for a moment!

Because the next instant, I had bitten into the spoon that Carla held out!!

<b>

The Bavarian cream melted in my mouth immediately, releasing the flavor of the blended strawberries. The jelly that was on top of the Bavarian cream crumbled with just a touch of my teeth, spreading the gentle acidity of the strawberry juice filled with fruit into my mouth!!

Ah, the enchanting strawberry Bavarian cream...!

<b>

I placed both hands on my cheeks, shaking my face in delight as I surrendered to this blissful moment.

<b>

"How is it? Delicious, right? Sue?"

"…Mm, …it's the best...!"

<b>

I finally managed to respond to Carla's question with just that.

And then came the onslaught of spoons!!

<b>

"Sue! I’ll give you some too! Here! Open wide!"

"…Should I give you some before I go get the permission slip...? Here, Sue, this orange Bavarian cream is delicious too!"

"Sue-chan! This milk Bavarian cream is the best?! Here! Ahhh!"

"This one too, Sue! Ahh, ahhh!"

<b>

Jessica, Colin, Mia, Alicia, one after another, they all thrust their spoons toward me.

And happiness kept bursting in my mouth one after another.

The flavor of chestnut! The orange jam! The richness of milk! The refreshing taste of lemon!

Ah! Bliss! Bliss!! Bliss!!!

I remained with my hands on my cheeks, becoming all mushy!

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Oh? Speaking of which! Where did Arvin go?!"

"If it's Arvin, he finished his meal and went out for a nap right away."

"Ugh... come on! What a pain!"

<b>

While Bibi looked at me being fed by everyone with a mix of exasperation, she suddenly realized that Arvin was missing and spoke up.

<b>

Yeah, Arvin quickly devoured his "soup-drenched beef bowl" and dashed out of the cafeteria...

Dana also left quickly after finishing her meal.

Dana happily went out saying she had an appointment to spar with a spear.

Well, it's fine since Dana isn't going to the "Adventurers' Guild" with us!

<b>

"What should we do? Should we wait for Arvin? Or should we apply for his outing permission just in case?"

"Ugh... I should have said something beforehand! That's my mistake!"

<b>

Well, even Bibi wouldn't expect Arvin to disappear right after lunch.

Now then, since Bibi seems down, should I go look for him and see where he is?

He wouldn't be trying to flirt... no, he wouldn't be setting up any flags in such a short time, right?! Surely not...?

Seriously! The Haggard family has a hero complex, so I want him to be careful and hold back! Unexpected actions can often hit those around him too!!

<b>

"…Huh? Is Arvin coming this way?"

"Eh?! Really?! Sue! Where is he now?!"

"He's almost there, he should be at the entrance of the cafeteria soon."

<b>

I wonder what happened to his nap? Did he give up on it? Coming back so soon... hmm, I wonder if something happened?

Wait, ...huh? Is he walking with someone? Is he bringing someone with him?

Why? Huh? Huh?!

<b>

Eventually, Arvin passed through the entrance, returning to the cafeteria with a nonchalant attitude.

As soon as he spotted us, he walked straight over.

And the person accompanying him was timidly following behind him, clutching the sleeve of Arvin's shirt and glancing around nervously as if trying to hide in his shadow.

<b>

Seeing that, everyone was... frozen.

"This guy really messed up."

Surely everyone's inner thoughts were beautifully unison in lines like this!

I can't bear to look at Bibi's face right now... it's a bit scary.

I can sense a strong aura of anger slowly leaking out.

That's why it's so frightening!!

<b>

"Suzie, I’d like to ask you about this child for a moment, is that okay?"

<b>

Ignoring the tense atmosphere, Arvin called out to me.

The girl referred to as "this child"... my roommate, Karen Marlin, timidly peeked out from behind Arvin, blushing as she deeply bowed her head toward me.
