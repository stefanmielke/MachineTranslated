# Chapter 140: Beyond the Conspiracy

It was a room that was truly simple and devoid of embellishments. That said, it wasn't filthy either.

In the room, there was a sufficiently sized desk and a larger sofa set.

And a cabinet lined with a small amount of alcohol and glasses.

There were two doors, but there wasn't even a window in this room.

The magical lamp on the ceiling had a low brightness, and shadows lingered in the corners of the room.

It was a room that visibly reflected the rationalism of its owner, who only kept necessary items.

<b>

"It's still a dark and unrefined room."

"Ah? As long as I have what I need, that's enough. There's no point in decorating it."

<b>

An elderly man sitting in the center of the sofa flipped through the documents in his hand with difficulty, muttering irritably.

The man sitting opposite him, also on the sofa, buried his massive body into the sofa and replied indifferently.

He then tossed more documents onto the table.

<b>

"This is from the homeland as well."

"What is it? What else could there be besides this quarter's financial statement?"

<b>

The elderly man reached out suspiciously towards the discarded documents.

<b>

Three figures could be seen in that room.

<b>

In addition to the two who just exchanged words, there was a slender man standing behind the elderly man on the sofa.

Both the elderly man and the slender man wore inconspicuous, plain lead-colored robes. However, it was clear that they were wearing high-quality clothing underneath the drab robes.

<b>

"What does this mean?! There should be more than ten years until the deadline!"

<b>

After confirming the newly thrown documents, the elderly man threw strong words at the large man sitting across from him.

<b>

"How would I know? They must have had their own circumstances."

"Show results in a year?! If you can't do that, you want us to hand over the mine?! Do you really think such lawlessness can go unchallenged?!!"

"If you can't do it, we'll withdraw from you, that's all."

"……You!!"

"You call it lawlessness, but isn't that what you've been doing all along?"

"Who do you think has allowed you to be here now!"

"Just take your rights back quickly, right? You're dragging your feet, and that's why the higher-ups are getting impatient, isn't it?"

"If we take forceful measures there, unnecessary inspections might come in. We're proceeding cautiously to ensure we secure it!"

"Is that something we should be concerned about? The results presented are everything. Isn't that right?"

"You promised not to interfere with my methods."

"I won't interfere with your methods."

"…………I expect you to arrange for personnel."

"It's just the right time for us to make a replenishment. I'll submit a large request. Just make sure to charge a hefty transportation fee."

"What a detestable bunch!"

"Haha! That's thanks to you, isn't it? Lawrence Niven! Hahaha!"

"Don't forget that the reason you can boast is because I allow it! Stearpike!!"

"Hahaha! It's good to see you're lively. If you have the means, I recommend acting quickly."

"What a bold thug you are!"

"Things have been quite suspicious lately. I don't mind if you burn yourself, but it's a nuisance if the flames spread."

"Then all the more reason to be cautious! Truly, the nation of Anatris is a selfish one!"

"Thanks to that, you are where you are now. Isn't that right? Huh? Lawrence Niven? Hahahaha!"

"Damn it!"

<b>

Lawrence Niven, the elderly man, tightened his grip on the documents in his hand. Frowning in irritation, he glared at the large man sitting across from him.

<b>

The man called Stearpike was a giant, towering over two meters tall.

His bald head, devoid of any body hair, bore a scar that looked as if it had been split open, extending deep into his face.

Stearpike's eyes always gleamed with the ferocity of a violent embodiment, constantly intimidating those who faced him.

It was unclear whether he had vision in his milky left eye, but those skilled in magic would know that a sinister magical power lurked deep within that white pupil.

<b>

Most people would shrink back when glared at by such a fierce giant.

They would feel as if they were exposing their lives defenselessly right in front of their opponent's nose.

<b>

However, Lawrence showed no signs of flinching in response to the intimidating glare.

This man also harbored a ferocity that belied his appearance deep within him.

<b>

――To demand the mine at this point is utterly ridiculous! It's a rare Gravisten vein. If the country learns of it, it will quickly turn into a national project. If that happens, there will be no turning back. The reason I approached the United Nations of Anatris was to completely seize control of the area around that mine before it escalated to that point.

Stearpike says things are suspicious here, but the truly unsettling situation is around Anatris.

<b>

The fact that they are bringing this up at this time is likely related to last year's destruction of the prized navy. As a result, pressure from neighboring countries has increased, forcing a rapid military buildup.

This means they need to procure materials for that purpose.

Having taken the time to come this far, I won't allow them to snatch it away from the side now!――

<b>

"……Is it first to obtain the gem…"

<b>

After a moment of thought, Lawrence Niven squinted slightly and murmured softly.

<b>

"Father."

<b>

At that moment, the slender man standing behind him leaned down and called out softly.

<b>

"……What is it?"

<b>

Just as Lawrence's eyes widened at what the man said, there was a loud knock on the door of the room.

<b>

"What is it?!"

"I-I apologize! It's an urgent message!"

<b>

Stearpike shouted in an irritated voice at the voice from beyond the door. Immediately, a tense voice responded.

Upon granting entry, a pale-faced man hurriedly approached Stearpike.

However, he opened his mouth to report but hesitated as his gaze darted towards Lawrence and the others.

<b>

"Go ahead. Report."

"Yes! Currently, multiple urban bases have been seized by enemy forces!"

<b>

The man's appearance resembled that of a street thug, but his movements were those of a trained soldier.

Lawrence and the others seemed unconcerned by this imbalance.

<b>

"Seized? What happened to the troops at the bases?"

"There are no remaining forces at the bases!"

"There was no prior information from the guard squad. But does this mean they had that many pieces hidden…? What about enemy forces?"

"Currently under verification!"

"What is Fluke doing?"

"Reportedly, he has been secured by opposing forces."

"Tch! That useless brat!"

"Could it be that classified information has leaked?! Stearpike! How do you intend to take responsibility for this?!"

<b>

"Is this what you just gathered? Lawrence… That earring, is it a long-distance magical tool? Quite a convenient item."

"This is a product that can only be used in a place like this, but it's quite useful for issuing business instructions."

<b>

In response to Stearpike's question, the slender man placed his hand on his chest and answered politely while shaking his thin silver hair.

<b>

"Van! I must hurry back to the consulate!"

"I understand, Father."

<b>

The man called Van stood up and followed Lawrence towards the exit, but stopped a few steps ahead.

<b>

"Stearpike, if you don't mind, shall we secure that lot ourselves?"

<b>

Turning to face Stearpike, he said this with a quiet smile.

<b>

"Oh?"

"No, we cannot welcome any further information leaks."

"Just as expected from the next head of the Afritrina Trading Company! Reliable! In that case, I will ask for your assistance."

"Understood. Then, by tonight."

"Van! We must hurry!!"

<b>

"Then, I regret to say goodbye, but I will take my leave now."

<b>

Ignoring the irritated voice of Lawrence as he left the room, the slender man called Van bowed deeply as if paying homage to a subordinate.

However, his gaze did not seem to capture Stearpike.

It was as if he had a master to serve in the darkness behind him, and after bowing respectfully, he closed the door behind him, following Lawrence.

<b>

<b>

After the two left the room, Stearpike issued instructions to his subordinates.

<b>

"Tomorrow morning, head west. Prepare for a swift withdrawal. When he brings Fluke, bring him here. Until then, no one is to enter. Also, prepare the 'dog.' Let him use it."

<b>

After dismissing his subordinates, Stearpike sank into the sofa alone.

Then, he spoke to the empty space around him.

<b>

"Hmph! Lawrence is quite anxious. So? What does he desire?"

<b>

"The red gem… if I recall correctly?"

<b>

There was a response to that.

In a room that should have been empty, a shadow moved in a corner where light did not reach, taking on a human form.

<b>

"It can't just be a gem, can it?"

<b>

Stearpike continued speaking to the shadow as if it had been there from the beginning.

The shadow that had taken on a human shape gradually revealed a blue dress and brown skin.

<b>

"Well, if I had to say, it's more like… the key to the treasury, I suppose? Hehe."

"The treasury, huh? That's good."

<b>

The brown-skinned woman moved silently, flowing towards Stearpike as if moving through water.

<b>

"Is he already aware that the fire is spreading to him?"

"Who knows? What do you think?"

"If he's going to be overwhelmed, let's put it to good use ourselves."

"Hehe… If we can, that would be nice."

<b>

The woman who had settled at the edge of the sofa leaned closer to Stearpike and affectionately stroked his chin.

<b>

"Are you sure it's fine to leave the young master alone?"

"The fun is best saved for later."

"Hmph! Then I'll enjoy myself until the time comes."

"Yes. Let's savor the brilliance of life to the fullest. Hehe, hehehe, hehehehe…"

<b>

The dimly lit room was further engulfed in deeper darkness.

The man's ferocious chuckle leaked out.

In harmony with it, the alluring and seductive laughter of the woman echoed quietly throughout the corners of the room.
