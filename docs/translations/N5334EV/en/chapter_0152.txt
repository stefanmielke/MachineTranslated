# 140 The Other Side of the Plot

It is a very simple room without any decorations. But it is not dirty.

The room is furnished with a large enough office desk and a set of large sofas.

And a cabinet with just a few drinks and glasses.

There are two doors, but this room does not even have a window.

The magic lamps on the ceiling have a low luminous intensity, and darkness stands in the corners of the room.

The rationalism of the room's owner was visible in the room, where only necessary items were placed.

<blank>

The room is as dimly lit and tacky as ever."

Oh?" It's enough if you have what you need. There's no point in being fancy."

<blank>

A first-year man sitting in the center of the sofa muttered evasively as he rolled up his papers in his hand, looking painfully at them.

A man sitting across from him on the sofa buried his huge body in the sofa and replied as if he didn't care what he said.

Then he threw more papers on the table as it was.

<blank>

It's from home, too.

What is it? What else is there to say besides this quarter's financial statements?"

<blank>

The first elderly man reaches for the papers thrown out quizzically.

<blank>

Three figures could be seen in the room.

<blank>

In addition to the two men who have just exchanged words, a slender man stands behind the sofa where the elderly man sits, as if following him.

The two men, one elderly and the other slender, were dressed in unobtrusive, plain, lead-colored robes. However, within peeking out from the plain robes, one could see that both were wearing high quality clothing.

<blank>

What do you mean? There must be more than 10 years until the deadline!"

<blank>

The first man who checked the new documents that had been thrown out threw strong words at the large man sitting in front of him.

<blank>

I don't know. I guess they had their reasons."

Show us what you've accomplished in a year! And if you can't do that, you want us to hand over the mine? Do you really think you can get away with such lawlessness?

If you don't, we'll leave you alone, that's all."

"...... you!

"You talk about lawlessness, but haven't you done that a million times before?"

Who do you think got us here in the first place?

Why don't you just take away their rights? You've been stalling for so long that your superiors have grown weary of you."

If we take aggressive measures there, we may be subject to unnecessary inspections. We are proceeding with caution to make sure we get it!

Is that something we should take into consideration? The result is all that matters. Is it not?"

You promised not to tell me how to do my job.

I'm not going to tell you how to do your thing.

I'll have ............ man it for you."

It's just the time of year when we need to replenish. I'll put in a large application. We can charge as much as we can for shipping."

What a bunch of loathsome bastards!"

"Huh! You're the only one who can do it, aren't you? Lawrence Niven! Ha-ha-ha!

Don't forget that the only reason you can talk so big is because I allow you to! Steerpike!

I'm glad to hear you're doing well! I'm glad to see you're doing well. If you have a hand, I suggest you strike early."

"How dare these fools talk to me!"

I can't help it," he said, "I've been having a bad smell lately. I don't mind if you start your own flames, but I don't like it when they spread.

If this is the case, we need to be even more cautious! The country of Anatolius is a selfish thing!

It's what got you where you are today. Right? Right? Lawrence Niven? Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

Son of a bitch!

<blank>

The hand holding the papers in the hand of the elderly man known as Lawrence Niven was filled with strength. His brow wrinkled abominably and he glared at the large man sitting in front of him.

<blank>

The man called Steerpike is a big man, over two meters tall.

The head of the skinhead, without a single hair on his body, bears a deep scar that connects to his face, as if he had been head-only cracked open.

Steerpike's eyes are always filled with the light of a ferocious embodiment of violence, always intimidating those who confront him.

The left eyeball, which is so clouded that it is difficult to tell whether it has eyesight or not, is so white that a person skilled in magic would know that there is a disastrous magical power stagnating behind its white pupil.

<blank>

Most people would cower in fear if they were stared at by such a huge, ferocious man.

Because it makes you realize that you are exposing your life unprotected, right under their noses.

<blank>

However, Lawrence did not seem intimidated at all by the man's intimidating glare.

This man, too, has a ferociousness deep in his gut that does not match his appearance.

<blank>

--The mine is a rare gravistein mine! It is a vein of rare gravistein. If the country gets wind of it, it will suddenly become a national project. If that happens, we have no choice. The reason I approached the Anatolian Confederacy was to take complete control of the area around the mine before that happens.

Steerpike says this place smells fishy, but what is really disturbing is the area around Anatolis.

<blank>

The fact that they are making this announcement at this time probably has something to do with the destruction of their navy last year, which was a treasure trove of naval power. As a result, pressure from neighboring countries has increased, forcing an immediate buildup of military power.

It would be necessary to procure materials for this purpose.

We took our time to come this far. I can't stand to have it snatched from the side now! --

<blank>

"...... get the treasure first or ......"

<blank>

Lawrence Niven thought instantly, then squinted slightly and muttered quietly.

<blank>

Father.

<blank>

A slender man standing behind him bent down and called out in a whisper into Lawrence's ear.

<blank>

"...... what?"

<blank>

Almost as soon as Lawrence's eyes widened at what the man had just said, the door to the room slammed violently.

<blank>

What's going on?

I'm sorry, sir! This is an urgent message!

<blank>

Steerpike sends a sullen voice through the door. Then a nervous voice came back without transparency.

Once he is allowed to enter, a man with a pale face hurries up to Steerpike.

However, he is about to open his mouth to make a report, but hesitates, his eyes darting toward Lawrence and the others.

<blank>

I don't care. Report up.

Haha! Several citywide bases have now been seized by enemy forces!"

<blank>

The man looks and dresses like a street thug, but acts like a trained military man.

Lawrence and the others did not seem to be bothered by the imbalance, as if they did not feel any sense of discomfort.

<blank>

"Seized? What happened to the men at the base?"

There are no troops remaining in the base at this time!

I didn't even get any advance info from the Guard. But you still had that many pieces hidden away. ...... What about enemy forces?"

We're checking in now!"

What is Fluke doing?"

Reports are that it has been secured by opposing forces."

He was like, "Damn! You are such a useless boy."

'Wasn't there a security leak? Steerpike! How are you going to take responsibility for this!"

<blank>

'Is this the same one you just stocked? Lawrence. ...... those earrings, the magic tool of far-fetched tales? That's handy stuff."

It's a product that can only be used around town, but it's very useful for giving business instructions."

<blank>

To Steerpike's question, a slender man puts his hand on his chest and shows a condescending answer, shaking his thin silver-white hair.

<blank>

Van! I'm rushing back to the consulate!"

Yes, Father.

<blank>

The man called Van got up and followed Lawrence toward the exit, but stopped after a few steps.

<blank>

Mr. Steerpike, if you don't mind, we'd like to secure the handler for you. If you don't mind, I'd like to secure the handler for you."

<blank>

He turns to Steerpike on the spot and quietly raises the corners of his mouth as he says so.

<blank>

How?"

No, we do not welcome any further information leaks.

The next head of the Grand Chamber of Commerce of Aphitrina! I can count on you! In that case, I shall ask for your help."

I understand. I will see you tonight."

Van! We've got to hurry!

<blank>

Then I am very sorry to leave you, but I must take my leave."

<blank>

While Lawrence, who had left the room with an exasperated voice, was standing by the slender man called Van, who bent at the waist and bowed deeply, deeply, deeply, as if he were bowing to a retainer.

But his eyes do not seem to catch the steer pike.

He hung his head graciously, as if there was someone to serve in the darkness behind him, and then closed the door to the room after Lawrence.

<blank>

<blank>

After the two men leave the room, Steerpike directs them toward his men.

<blank>

Tomorrow morning we head west. "We'll head west tomorrow morning and be ready to move out quickly. When he brings Fluke, bring him here. Until then, don't let anyone in. And get the dog ready. He'll use it."

<blank>

After his men leave the room, Steerpike sinks down on the couch alone.

And then, he spoke the words directly into the empty space.

<blank>

"Hmmm, Lawrence! Lawrence, you are in a great hurry. What does he want? What does he want?

<blank>

Red Jewel ......, was it?"

<blank>

Some respond to it.

Inside a room where no one is supposed to be. A shadow in the corner where no light shines moves and takes on the form of a person.

<blank>

It's not just jewelry, is it?"

<blank>

Steerpike turned to the shadow and continued speaking as if it had been there from the beginning.

The shadows that take on human form reveal their azure dresses and brown skin as you watch.

<blank>

"Well, I guess you could call it the key to the ...... treasury. Hmm."

Treasury. That's good."

<blank>

The brown woman moves to Steerpike's side without making a sound, as if she were moving through the water, as if she were flowing.

<blank>

Does he realize the fire is already turning on him?"

"Well? What do you think?"

If we can't have it all, we'll make good use of it."

'Hmmm... ....... If you can, that would be great too."

<blank>

A woman slumped on the edge of the sofa, leaning over Steerpike and lovingly stroking his chin up.

<blank>

I'm going to use the 'something special' you brought for the kid to dazzle him during the retreat."

"Oh, you're going to use that thing. I'm looking forward to it."

I hope they go out with a bang."

<blank>

Steerpike put his hands around the woman's waist and held her body forcefully.

The woman presses her ample bosom against the man as if to rub it up against him.

<blank>

Can we leave the sergeant alone?"

I'm one to save the fun for later.

Hmph! Then I'll entertain you until it's time to go."

I agree. Let's enjoy life to the fullest. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. ......"

<blank>

The dimly lit room is invaded by an even deeper darkness.

The man's ferocious chuckle leaks out.

Overlapping it, a bewitching and glamorous woman's laughter secretly echoed to every corner of the room.
