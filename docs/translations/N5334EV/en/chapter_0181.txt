# 169 Episode 169 Jules Nard's Notion

What the hell, Jules Nard? You're drinking very well, aren't you? If you're doing so well, why don't you buy me a drink too!"

Shut up! I'm drinking with the weight of my life! There's not a drop of it left for you to drink!"

<blank>

The man who put his hand on Jules Nard's shoulder and called out to him as he was drinking at a familiar counter, laughed at his swordsmanship and left the place, saying, "This is so funny.

Then he moved straight to the table behind me and started laughing and stirring drinks with the guys there as if the conversation had never happened.

<blank>

Jules Nard glanced off to the side, lifted the glass in his hand, and sipped its contents slightly.

He slowly rolled it around in his mouth as if to check the taste of the mellow liquid, and eventually dropped it down the back of his throat with reluctance.

Then he let out a deep, deep, grand exhale.

<blank>

<blank>

How did this happen?

Jules Nard no longer knows.

If you look around you, you can see the strong iron bars surrounding you.

But the spacing between those steel poles is so scanty that I can get in and out with plenty of time to spare. ...... and.

I understand that in a sense, this is something that protects me.

But for Jules Nard, who has always lived as he pleases ever since he can remember, this situation is nothing short of bewildering.

<blank>

You mean you've become a lapdog. ......

I put my hand on his neck and rubbed it, but of course there was no way I could feel his collar.

<blank>

Those bars are quite a distance away from me.

The closer you walk, the further away the grate will be.

A steel fence that surrounds you without sticking to you.

<blank>

Once again, I exhale loudly.

Are you saying you're being watched 24/7?

Still, I felt no watchful glances or signs of surveillance from my surroundings.

If you don't dare to turn your attention toward it, you won't be able to feel the cage that surrounds you.

<blank>

I guess we'll just have to change our minds here. ......

<blank>

This is a job. It's a contract.

Any job, if you take it, has its own restrictions.

This job is, in essence, "If the lady wants information on a whim, you do everything you can to meet it.

That way, I get paid for information on each job, and I get paid for the amount of people I keep throughout the year.

...... It's not bad for the conditions. It's rather unbeatable.

<blank>

<blank>

In other words, as long as you are under the protection of that young lady, you are guaranteed safety.

In a way, there is no safer place on earth.

<blank>

There is no guarantee that he will be able to survive as well as he has in the future. Jules Nard is well aware of this.

Then I decided that this was a good opportunity to make up my mind.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Have you ever heard of "Gor the Blue Snake?"

<blank>

The young lady came, as usual, from outside Jules Nard's perception.

<blank>

Calm afternoon.

As soon as his buttocks settled on a familiar stool at his favorite bar, Jules Nard knew he had lost his escape.

The question was asked from behind me, as I was holding the glass I had lifted to sip it, rigidly, forgetting to breathe.

<blank>

It is a question that Jules Nard asks with the understanding that he recognizes himself from the end.

I don't believe that they are unaware of me, not even for a millimeter. He knows everything about us.

<blank>

A man named Gohl the Blue Snake. Do you know where he is now?"

<blank>

Huh? Did you not catch that? As if to say, "Did you not catch that?" the owner of the voice repeated the question at a closer distance than before.

<blank>

Jules Nard looked fearfully in the direction of the voice, holding his cheek, which was about to twitch, as best he could.

Sure enough, there they are, large emerald green eyes asking, "How is it?" and peeking at me, asking, "How are you doing?

<blank>

"To ......, ah......ia."

<blank>

I finally speak up, but it is not in words.

<blank>

"What, you don't know?"

"Yes, yes! I know!

<blank>

The discouraged sound in his voice made me cling to the words as if I were clinging to him.

<blank>

...... That's a nasty son of a bitch that drifted in from Anatolis."

<blank>

The name of the guy asked was the name of a guy who was in a bad way off the charts.

Not many people on our side know his name.

I never thought it would come out of the mouth of this young lady who I don't believe is involved with the backstage ....... This is completely out of the realm of the expected.

It is a name that no one living in a normal, sunny place will have to deal with for the rest of his or her life.

<blank>

It is said that she is called by that name because of a long, thin, blue bruise that wraps around her left wrist and the back of her hand.

Since he usually hides his left hand with a glove, it is said that few people have actually seen it.

<blank>

He is not a person you can talk to so easily because he is the kind of guy who carefully erases evidence.

There is no one who probes him or indicates that he has information about him here in the State of Calais, ...... especially on the eastern side.

There are rumors circulating that if you carelessly stick your head in, you will be bound and dragged to an unknown hole in the ground.

I don't know what's really going on, but I guess it means that he's the kind of guy who's going to target us. It seems that he is living in the deepest, darkest part of the state of Calais.

<blank>

It's a messy story. I definitely don't want to get involved with them.

<blank>

He's a smooth talker and a con man, but he's also a very skilled man, and now he's in charge of all the bandits in the Hexagom area.

<blank>

However, I found that my mouth was spewing out information about him as if I were winding him up all at once.

<blank>

Because!

The level of danger of his information is a different dimension of existence compared to the young lady in front of you. I responded with a spinal reflex without any room to think.

Upon hearing the reply, the young lady turned behind her and said, "I knew it!" She is sounding happy and agitated.

<blank>

It was only then that Jules Nard realized that the young lady was not alone today, but that she was with her tureen.

<blank>

I thought he would know! I figured if I asked this guy, he'd know!"

<blank>

The young lady is in a good mood and starts an ah-ha conversation with the three people she brought with her.

I brought three people.

They are about the same age as your daughter, one is big and one is small.

The other is somewhat older than the young lady. She is wearing a maid's uniform, so she is probably a maid of honor who takes care of the young lady.

<blank>

However, the killing spirit that the maid wears is unusual.

By the time I got here, Jules Nard somehow understood that this maid must have been sending a lot of killing spirits around and checking all the insects approaching her daughters .......

<blank>

The Blue Viper is an organization headed by him. I hear they're pretty dangerous.

<blank>

They are presenting information that was not asked for, one after another.

It's an unusual situation, but it's the other side. Reluctance to pay out is tantamount to strangling your own neck.

<blank>

Thank you Jules Nard. "Thank you, Jules Nard! You're the best."

No, no! It's not a damn thing!"

<blank>

Sensing that the other party was satisfied, Jules Nard's shoulders relax.

<blank>

<blank>

"Well, no matter how bad they are, they're like aphids compared to Miss ......

"............ a-ne-go?"

Heh?" ...... heh, heh. Miss Suzy's ......"

"Arrah? Who's Miss?"

Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ！！！！"

<blank>

Wow! Wow! Sue, my face!

"Wow ......, I've never seen Sue's face like this before."

<blank>

Jules Nard's face turns the color of paper as his reassuringly lighthearted remark is returned with more intimidation than he could have imagined.

When Suzy said, "Don't call me that again," feeling the pressure of being crushed, Jules Nard moved his head up and down again and again like a broken doll.

<blank>

But if you can locate the place, it would be ideal to wipe it out!"

I knew it.

'Sue, I don't know what you're talking about, but you might want to have a few plovers and markers.

<blank>

She turns to Jules Nard and sniffs, "Huns! After sniffling, he looks at Suzy, who has started a conversation with the tureens, and his whole body relaxes again, thinking that this place has been forgiven for now.

As Jules Nard was about to slip off his stool, something was placed in front of him in the middle of the table with a heavy thud.

<blank>

I quickly regrouped my scattered consciousness and looked at what was placed on the table and realized, belatedly, that the expressionless maid had placed a leather bag on the table.

<blank>

Somehow, the Lady seems to have taken a liking to you. As long as you are able to meet the Lady's expectations, know that you are under the protection of Amkam."

"...... this."

<blank>

For some reason, the maid, exuding a hint of grumpiness, urged him to check the bag with her eyes behind the pinch glasses on her nose.

<blank>

If you are still here safe and sound at the end of the year, I will give you the same amount again."

Is this so ......?"

<blank>

Inside were nearly ten large gold coins.

I hear that the annual income of a regular knight is about 450A.

This is clearly a comparable amount. I gulp unintentionally.

<blank>

If your daughter wanted to, she could generate this level of revenue in less than 10 days. It is not your concern. In addition to this, you will be paid for every job you do. So, please be mindful of this.

<blank>

The cold-eyed maid's terms were truly unbeatable.

<blank>

At least we had information that blue snakes were lurking in the vicinity of Hexagom. We are very reluctant to do so, but I would say that we have met our goal. ......

<blank>

This guy is some kind of monster,......, Jules Nard is convinced, as he looks into the eyes of the maid, who makes no attempt to hide her displeasure.

The maid continued to say things like, "If we had a little more time, we could have located them too .......

<blank>

"Serve with sincerity."

<blank>

Jules Nard nodded silently at the last word and look that confronted him.

<blank>

<blank>

That was just a day ago.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I wonder if the young lady is having an elegant dinner at the Hexagom Inn right now?

No, there's no such lofty place in that city. ......

Well, I guess they are trying to find out.

<blank>

Either way, by the end of today or tomorrow, it will be a much more airy city.

<blank>

I'm sorry to hear that you've been singled out by such an unreasonable party, but in light of what they've done, I can't say I have any sympathy for them.

...... heh! What the heck are you talking about? I'm just saying.

<blank>

<blank>

Jules Nard fumbled in his jacket pocket, pulled out a coin from inside, and rolled it on the table.

The maid gave me three medium gold coins as the last payment for the information.

<blank>

After toying with them on the table for a while, he picks up one of them.

As it is, he calls out to the bartender behind the counter and slowly flips that gold coin.

<blank>

He then told the man who had just tangled with him ...... to bring a bottle of liquor identical to his own to the table of the man he had just probed.

<blank>

<blank>

Trust is more important than anything else. Trust is! Duh!

If the story you have provided turns out to be a lie, the only one who will be wiped out in an instant is yourself.

There is no better way to increase the accuracy of the mouth from which information can be obtained.

At this point, I'll work harder than ever to build relationships!

Bonding? It's necessary, isn't it? Mm-hmm.

<blank>

<blank>

Jules Nahl decided on the heart of the matter.
