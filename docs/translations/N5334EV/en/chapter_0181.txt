# Chapter 169: The Concept of Jules Narl

"What's up, Jules Narl! You're drinking some good liquor, huh? If you're doing well, treat me too!"

"Shut up! I'm drinking based on the weight of your life! There's not a single drop for you to drink!!"

<b>

The man who casually put his hand on Jules Narl's shoulder and spoke to him at the familiar counter laughed, saying, "That's scary," and left the scene.

He then moved to a table behind, laughing with the men there as if the previous conversation had never happened.

<b>

Jules Narl, who watched this with a sidelong glance, lifted his glass and took a small sip of its contents.

He rolled the viscous liquid in his mouth as if to savor its flavor, and eventually swallowed it down with a reluctant expression.

Then he exhaled deeply and grandly.

<b>

<b>

How did it come to this?

Even Jules Narl no longer understands.

Looking around, he can visualize himself surrounded by sturdy iron bars.

Though the spacing of those iron bars is wide enough for him to enter and exit with ease...

In a way, he understands that this is something that protects him.

However, for Jules Narl, who has always lived freely since he became aware of the world, this situation is nothing but bewildering.

<b>

So, I've become a pet dog, huh...?

Thinking this, he placed his hand on his neck and rubbed it, but of course, there was no sensation of a collar.

<b>

Those iron bars are quite a distance away from him.

If he walks closer, the iron bars also seem to move away.

They are set up around him, neither too close nor too far.

<b>

He takes a deep breath again.

Am I being monitored 24/7?

Even so, he feels no gaze or presence that suggests he is being watched.

If he deliberately does not focus on it, he can no longer perceive the cage that surrounds him.

<b>

Perhaps I should change my way of thinking about this...

<b>

This is a job. A contract.

No matter what job it is, there are always some constraints involved.

This job essentially means, "If the young lady whimsically wants information, respond to it with all your might."

If he does that, he will receive a fee for each piece of information, and throughout the year, he will also be compensated for keeping him around.

...The conditions aren't bad. In fact, they are exceptional.

<b>

<b>

In a way, as long as he is under the protection of that young lady, his safety is guaranteed.

There is no place on the ground that is safer than this.

<b>

There is no guarantee that he will be able to survive as he has until now. Jules Narl is fully aware of that.

So, he decided to think of this situation as a good opportunity to make a firm resolution.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Do you know 'The Blue Snake Goul'?"

<b>

That young lady, as always, appeared from outside Jules Narl's awareness.

<b>

In the calm afternoon.

As soon as he settled into his familiar stool at the bar, Jules Narl understood that he had lost his escape route.

He was frozen in place, forgetting to breathe, with the glass he had lifted to his lips still in hand when the previous question was asked from behind him.

<b>

It was a question posed with the understanding that Jules Narl recognized her.

She did not think for a moment that he was unaware of her presence. She could see through him completely.

<b>

"Do you know where 'The Blue Snake Goul' is now?"

<b>

Huh? Didn't catch that? As if to say that, the voice's owner repeated the question from a closer distance than before.

<b>

Jules Narl, desperately suppressing the twitching of his cheeks, cautiously turned his gaze toward the source of the voice.

As expected, there were large emerald-green eyes peering at him, asking, "What about it?"

<b>

"...Uh, y-yeah"

<b>

He finally managed to utter a sound, but it did not form into words.

<b>

"What? You don't know?"

"I-I do! I know!"

<b>

The words spilled out as if he were clinging to her, in response to her disappointed tone.

<b>

"...Well, he's a troublesome guy who came from Anatoris."

<b>

The name he was asked about belonged to an extremely dangerous individual.

Even on this side, there are hardly any who know his name.

To hear it come from the mouth of this young lady, who he could never have imagined being involved with the underworld... This was completely beyond his expectations.

For someone living in the light, it was a name they would never encounter in their lifetime.

<b>

He is said to be called that due to a long, blue bruise wrapping around his left wrist and hand.

Since he usually hides his left hand with a glove, very few have actually seen it.

<b>

He is someone who meticulously erases evidence, so he is not someone to speak of lightly.

Those who seek information about him or show they possess such information are... especially in the eastern part of the Kalais region, almost nonexistent.

If one carelessly pokes their head in, rumors say they would be immediately bound and dragged into some unknown hole.

The truth of the matter is unclear, but it seems that he is targeted by those in his employ. Apparently, he has settled into a rather deep, dark part of the Kalais region.

<b>

It's a troublesome story. Definitely someone I want to avoid.

<b>

"He was a smooth talker, pulling off shady tricks here and there, but he's also quite capable, and now he's said to be gathering and leading the thieves around Hexagum."

<b>

But before he knew it, his mouth was rapidly spilling out information about that guy.

<b>

Why, you ask!

The danger level of his information is on a completely different dimension compared to the young lady in front of him. Without a moment's thought, he responded in a reflexive manner.

Hearing his response, the young lady exclaimed behind him, "I knew you would know!" and her voice was filled with delight.

<b>

It was then that Jules Narl first realized that this young lady was not alone today; she had companions with her.

<b>

"See?! I thought if I asked this guy, he would definitely know!"

<b>

The young lady cheerfully began conversing with the three she had brought along.

There were three of them.

Two were around the same age as the young lady, one tall and one small.

The other was somewhat older than the young lady. Dressed in a maid's outfit, she seemed to be a servant taking care of the young lady.

<b>

However, the murderous intent emanating from that maid was extraordinary.

Jules Narl vaguely understood that this maid had been radiating her killing intent to deter any insects that approached the girls until they arrived here.

<b>

"'Blue Viper' is the organization he leads. They say they're quite dangerous."

<b>

He was presenting information that had not even been asked for, one after another.

It was something that would normally be impossible, but given who he was dealing with, withholding information would be tantamount to tightening the noose around his own neck.

<b>

"Thank you, Jules Narl. You really helped me! As expected of you!"

"N-no! Not at all!!"

<b>

Feeling that the other party was satisfied, Jules Narl relaxed his shoulders.

<b>

<b>

"Well, even if they are dangerous, compared to the boss, they're like aphids..."

"…………A-boss?"

"Huh? ...Y-yeah. Suzy's boss..."

"Ah?? Who's the boss?"

"Yikes!!!"

<b>

"Whoa! Scary! Suzy, your face is scary!!"

"Wow... I've never seen Suzy look so displeased before."

<b>

Jules Narl's face turned pale in response to the unexpected intimidation from the light-hearted banter born from a sense of security.

Feeling the overwhelming pressure, he nodded repeatedly like a broken doll at Suzy, who said, "Never call me that again."

<b>

"But if we can pinpoint their location, it would be ideal to wipe them out!"

"Are we really going to use the Trojan Horse?"

"I don't really understand what Suzy is saying, but it might be better to have several Chidori and markers."

<b>

After snorting toward Jules Narl, Suzy began conversing with her companions, and he felt that he had been temporarily forgiven, allowing him to relax once more.

Just as he was about to slip off the stool, something heavy was placed in the middle of the table with a thud.

<b>

Gathering his scattered thoughts, he looked at the object that had been placed, realizing that the expressionless maid had set down a leather pouch.

<b>

"For some reason, it seems the young lady has taken a liking to you. As long as you can meet her expectations, know that you are under the protection of Amukam."

"…What is this?"

<b>

With an air of displeasure, the maid urged him to check the contents of the pouch with her eyes behind her pince-nez glasses.

<b>

"If you are still here safely when the new year arrives, I will give you the same amount again."

"W-wait, this much...?"

<b>

There were nearly ten gold coins inside.

He had heard that a knight's annual salary was around 450a.

This was clearly an amount that matched that. He swallowed hard.

<b>

"If the young lady sets her mind to it, she can generate this level of revenue in less than ten days. It's not something for you to worry about. Additionally, separately from this, you will receive compensation commensurate with the content of each job. Be sure to accept it with care."

<b>

The conditions presented by the cold-eyed maid were indeed exceptional.

<b>

"At the very least, we were aware that the Blue Snake was lurking around Hexagum. While it is quite regrettable, we can say that we have met the passing mark..."

<b>

Looking into the maid's eyes, which showed no intention of hiding her displeasure, Jules Narl became convinced that she was also a type of monster.

The maid continued, "If we had a little more time, we could have pinpointed their location..."

<b>

"Serve with all your heart."

<b>

At the last words and the maid's piercing gaze, Jules Narl silently nodded.

<b>

<b>

That was just a day ago.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I wonder if the young lady is now enjoying a luxurious dinner at an inn in Hexagum?

No, there aren't any such high-end places in that town...

Well, she must be gathering information.

<b>

In any case, it is certain that the town will become quite open within today or tomorrow.

It's unfortunate to be targeted by an incredibly unreasonable opponent, but considering that they have come, there is no room for sympathy.

...Heh! What a thing to say, right?

<b>

<b>

Jules Narl rummaged through his jacket pocket and took out a coin, rolling it on the table.

It was three silver coins he had received from the maid as payment for this round of information.

<b>

After toying with them on the table for a while, he picked one up.

He then called out to the bartender on the other side of the counter and casually flicked the coin.

<b>

He instructed the bartender to take the same drink as his to the man who had just approached him... the man who had been probing him.

<b>

<b>

Trust is the most important thing. Trust! Yes!

If the information he provided turns out to be a false lead, it would be his own neck on the line.

It is better to enhance the accuracy of the sources from which he can gather information.

In this case, he should work even harder on building relationships than before!

Bonds, huh? They are necessary! Yes, yes.

<b>

<b>

Jules Narl made up his mind.
