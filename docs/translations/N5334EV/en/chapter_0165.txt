# Chapter 153: Impatience

“Ughhyaaaahhh!!!”

<b>

As Karen turned her eyes towards Parker's scream, she saw him leaning back and falling, leaving only his right arm gripping his ankle.

Not understanding what had happened, she pried his fingers off her ankle and immediately rolled away to create distance.

<b>

“Hey, can you move?”

“Eh?! Haggard-kun?! Why are you here?!”

<b>

There was Irvin Haggard.

Irvin helped Karen to her feet and stepped forward to shield her. In his hand, he held a knight sword with a chipped tip.

<b>

“W-what was that just now? Why are you here?”

“That was... well, it's one of my tricks. I was in the back until just now... It was a bit noisy, so I came to check it out.”

“Back? Wait! There's blood!”

“Ah? Oh, it's fine. I stopped it after resting a bit.”

“That's... resting...”

<b>

Karen couldn't hide her surprise at the suddenly appearing Irvin.

He was covered in blood, yet he casually dismissed it as nothing.

The amount of blood clearly seemed like it required immediate treatment.

Yet he said it with a calm face, claiming it was fine because he had rested.

<b>

“More importantly, are you okay? Your legs seem pretty unsteady.”

<b>

Indeed, Karen's condition was not normal either.

Her back hurt severely from the impact. Breathing was a struggle. Moreover, her left radius was likely broken.

And her legs felt unusually heavy, as if they had turned to stone.

<b>

“Dameeeeee! I found you, Gagii!”

<b>

Fluke spotted Irvin and shouted.

His face twisted in rage as he recalled the humiliation from yesterday, turning a copper color.

It was a visage that hardly seemed human.

<b>

“I'll take you down, Gagii!!”

“What the hell is that? Who is it? Are these guys even human?”

“That’s probably Rodrigo, the moneylender... I think.”

“Hmm? That’s Roriringo...?”

<b>

Karen, who didn’t know Fluke’s name, blurted out the alias.

Irvin had heard from Philip that it was Fluke’s alias.

However, he narrowed his eyes, wondering if the creature before him was the same one he had seen yesterday.

<b>

<b>

“Guuoooohhh!!!”

<b>

Parker picked up his severed arm and pressed the wound against it, and the flesh began to squirm and attempt to reconnect.

<b>

“Ugh!”

“Ugh! That’s disgusting! Isn’t he not human after all?!”

<b>

Karen covered her mouth at the grotesque sight.

Irvin simply stopped recognizing it as a human.

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, Irvin placed a hand on Karen's upper arm, pulling her body as he lightly swung the knight sword he held.

A magical beast rolled right in front of Karen.

Irvin swung the knight sword and severed the left front leg of the magical beast that had jumped at them.

<b>

The magical beast thrashed about on the ground. Irvin kicked it away from Karen.

<b>

“Gagii! I’m not done yet!!!”

<b>

Fluke slammed the club he held onto the ground, shattering the cobblestones.

<b>

“Bara! I’ll crush you all!!!”

“Ah? I can’t understand what you’re saying. More importantly... Did you do this to Annie and the others?”

<b>

Irvin questioned Fluke, who was shouting angrily, swaying his body.

<b>

“Ah?! Those Mezugagi bastards, they were just messing around! Geha geha ha ha!!”

“You’ve been having your fun while I was taking a little nap...”

<b>

Irvin glared at Fluke, whose laughter made his eyes narrow slightly, a dangerous light igniting within.

<b>

“Ugh! You bastard! I’ll kill you right now!!!”

<b>

“Ugoaaahhh!!!”

“Haggard-kun!!!”

<b>

As Fluke shouted, Parker lunged at Irvin from the side.

Seeing this, Karen instinctively shouted.

But Irvin didn’t even glance at him and smoothly dodged, bringing down the knight sword he held with no effort.

In an instant, the blade of the knight sword sliced through the middle of Parker's upper arm.

<b>

“Gagyu! Guugyaaahhh!!!”

“I told you, didn’t I...?”

<b>

Ignoring Parker, who rolled away after losing his arm, Irvin turned his gaze to Fluke.

<b>

“The next time I see your face—”

“Ah?!”

<b>

Irvin pointed the knight sword at Fluke and stepped forward.

<b>

“I’ll take your head off in an instant—”

<b>

“Ka-huh?!”

<b>

No one present could follow Irvin's movement.

By the time they noticed, Fluke's head was tilted.

<b>

“Damn... that was too shallow.”

<b>

Irvin stood behind Fluke, muttering regretfully.

Karen could only stare in shock at how quickly Irvin had moved.

<b>

“Gah! Bogebob! Gobobob!”

<b>

Fluke's neck was slashed sideways but hadn’t fallen off.

It was still connected by a thin layer of skin.

Fluke pressed it back into place with his own hands, and the wound began to close up, bubbling.

<b>

“...You’re definitely not human, are you?”

<b>

The knight sword Irvin held broke off halfway and fell.

Irvin clicked his tongue softly at the piece of the knight sword that fell to his feet.

<b>

Suddenly, Irvin pressed his mouth shut.

<b>

“Ugh!”

<b>

Dark blood dripped from between his fingers that pressed against his mouth.

Blood began to pool at his feet, dripping from his pants.

<b>

“Haggard-kun?!”

<b>

Seeing this, Karen shouted.

Karen had collapsed onto the cobblestones. She no longer had the strength to stand.

Even so, she tried to crawl closer to Irvin, scratching the cobblestones with her fingers.

<b>

“It’s fine. Just a little cut opened up.”

“That's not just a little...!”

<b>

Irvin lightly raised his left hand towards Karen, signaling “it’s fine.”

Then he spat out a clot of blood that remained in his mouth.

<b>

<b>

—What the hell is he? An undead? No, is he alive?

If he’s undead, then the zombie soldiers that spawn in shallow layers are much worse.

They’re faster and stronger. Generally, even if you chop off their heads, they don’t stop moving.

Compared to that, these guys just seem tough.

I guess I have to crush their heads and hearts to finish them off...

And with the knight sword like this, I have to be willing to destroy my own arm to do it.

...Still, something feels nauseating in my chest. I’ve been feeling dizzy for a while now...

Have I lost too much blood?

Well, I can’t afford to hold back here. It’s looking dangerous, and I need to finish this quickly before it gets serious—

<b>

“I’m going to end this now.”

<b>

Irvin lightly thrust his left hand forward, taking a stance with the knight sword, which was broken in the middle, resting on his shoulder.

<b>

“Gehyabyahya! You’re all going to regret this! You can’t escape from me! I’ll make you pay for this!! Gya gya gya gya!”

<b>

“Is that so? I think if you push yourself a little, you can manage.”

“Geba gyagya! You’re wrong!”

<b>

Fluke swung the club he held.

From it, a magical light spilled out, and one of the dog-like magical beasts turned and ran towards Karen.

<b>

“?! You bastard!”

<b>

Irvin immediately redirected his focus to the magical beast.

Then, in an instant, he swung the knight sword, infused with the “ki” he had gathered.

<b>

“Slash Impact!”

<b>

Irvin shouted the name of the technique, and shockwaves were released from the knight sword.

<b>

It was a skill known as “Impact,” used to shoot sword energy, which Suzy employed.

Irvin had become quite proficient in it long ago.

Though it lacked power, he had managed to unleash it in less than a month since being taught.

The story of Suzy rolling her eyes and her jaw dropping for a while is a thing of the past.

<b>

<b>

The released shockwave caught up to the magical beast in an instant, slicing through its waist.

The screaming magical beast rolled in front of Karen, thrashing about.

<b>

At the same time, a small piece of the knight sword fell to Irvin's feet.

<b>

“Tch!!”

<b>

A club from Fluke came crashing down above Irvin.

Irvin slashed at the arm as he dodged, but he couldn’t sever it completely.

The wound that gushed blood quickly began to heal.

<b>

“You bastard, wasting time like this...”

“Gegya gyagya! What do you think! You can’t escape from me! You’re all going to regret this!!”

“This idiot! I’m not saying this for your sake, just let me handle it! There’s no time left!”

“Don’t you dare say that! I won’t let you do it!!”

<b>

<b>

This damn brat is panicking because he thinks he’s going to lose.

With this body and power, I can definitely kill this kid, no matter what kind of fighter he is.

For some reason, he already looks like he’s falling apart.

He should run out of stamina soon and be unable to move.

On top of that, his weapon is broken halfway. There’s no way that’s usable.

It’s just a matter of time.

<b>

On the other hand, the longer this goes on, the more power surges through my body. I don’t feel like I can lose at all.

The sense of omnipotence is extraordinary. There’s no one who can match me right now.

<b>

Once I crush this brat, the next target will be that girl.

I’ll take the stone and repay her for the trouble she caused earlier.

I’ll toy with her until her body is torn apart!

<b>

“Gegya byahya gya gya! I’ll crush you all!! Gegya gya gya gya gya!”

<b>

Fluke continued to laugh wickedly, imagining the rampage he was about to unleash.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

At that moment, the ground shook heavily.

<b>

It felt like some massive object had fallen, sending shockwaves through the air and causing the ground to tremble.

<b>

“Ah... time’s up.”

<b>

Irvin muttered softly, as if resigned.
