# 153 Episode 153 Impatience.

Aaaaahhhh!"

<blank>

When Karen turned to see what was going on at the sound of Parker's cry, she saw Parker sprawled on his back, leaving his right arm clutching his ankle.

Not knowing what had happened, I yanked off the fingers gripping my ankle and quickly rolled away from it.

<blank>

Hey, can you move?"

What? Mr. Haggard? Why?

<blank>

Irving Haggard was there.

Irving helped Karen to her feet and took a step forward as if to protect her. In his hand, he holds a nightsword with a chipped tip.

<blank>

"Hey, what was that? How did you get in here?"

That was ......, well, one of the ones I took. I was in the back a while ago, ....... It was bothering me a little bit, so I came over.

"Back to ......, wait! Blood!"

Oh?" Yeah, no problem, I got some sleep and it stopped."

"Such ...... sleeping ......"

<blank>

Karen cannot hide her surprise at Irving's sudden appearance.

He has blood stained his clothes badly, yet he makes light of it and says it is nothing.

The amount of blood loss was enough to require immediate medical treatment.

They look unconcerned and say that there is no problem because they have gone to bed.

<blank>

"Are you all right? You look a little unsteady on your feet.

<blank>

Certainly Karen's condition is not decent.

My back hurts terribly from the impact of the slam. I can barely breathe. And the radius of my left arm is probably broken.

And my legs were unusually heavy, as if they were turned to stone.

<blank>

De-gee-da-eee! Gogo no gagi! I'm gonna get you, you little gurgi!"

<blank>

Fluke found Irving and yelled at him.

His face is contorted in rage, remembering yesterday's humiliation and turning reddish-bronze.

It looks very un-human.

<blank>

Gi no reference gari oo gaeji dey!"

What the hell is that? Who are they? Are they even human, like that guy?"

That's probably Mr. Rodrigo the moneylender, ...... thinks."

"Yeah? That's the one, Lori Lingo, ......?"

<blank>

Karen, who does not know Fluke's name, tells him her alias as it is.

Irving had heard from Philip that it was an alias for Fluke.

However, I narrowed my eyes and wondered if the thing in front of me now was the same person I saw yesterday.

<blank>

<blank>

Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

When Parker picked up his severed arm and addressed the wound, the oozing flesh began to wriggle and try to connect.

<blank>

Ugh!"

Wow! That's disgusting! You're not even human, are you?

<blank>

Karen holds her mouth shut at the fearless sight.

Irving honestly stopped recognizing Sole as a person.

<blank>

<blank>

Suddenly, Irving put his hand on Karen's second arm, pulled her body as it was, and lightly swung the nightsword in his hand as if to dispel it on the spot.

The magical beast continues to roll in front of Karen's eyes.

Irving swung his nightsword and chopped off the left foreleg of a magical beast that had jumped in.

<blank>

The magical beast was jittering and scratching algae on the spot. Irving kicked it away from Karen.

<blank>

Gagi ga ah! Giggityaahhhh!"

<blank>

Fluke abominably slams the cudgel he is holding at his feet, shattering the cobblestones in its place.

<blank>

"Oh, "ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! I'm gonna get you in a heap!"

Oh? I don't know what you're talking about. I don't care what you're talking about. ...... You're the ones who did this to Annie and the kids?"

<blank>

Irving, who is facing Fulk and shaking his body, asks him a question.

<blank>

 I'll be damned if I'm going to let them get away with that! Gee ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

You've done a lot while I've been sleeping. ......

<blank>

Irving's eyes narrow slightly and a swarthy light comes on as he glares at Fluke, who laughs.

<blank>

I'm in a foul mood! I'm a five-horned gurgi! I'm going to kill you! I'm gonna beat the shit out of you!

<blank>

Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！"

Mr. Haggard!!!!"

<blank>

At the same time Fluke yelled at him, Parker jumped on Irving from right beside him.

Karen saw this and shouted as soon as she saw it.

Irving, however, does not even take a glance at his opponent, but instead just ducks, and without any effort, he brings down the nightsword in his upraised arm.

A moment later, the blade of the nightsword sliced through the middle of Parker's second arm.

<blank>

Giggle! 

I told you, didn't I ......?"

<blank>

Not looking at Parker, who rolls around with his arm cut off, Irving turns to Fluke.

<blank>

Next time I see that face--"

Aaah!

<blank>

Irving points his nightsword at Fluke and steps out.

<blank>

"I'm going to lose my head as fast as I can."

<blank>

Ka-hyuh?

<blank>

No one present could follow Irving's movements.

I noticed that Fluke's head was tilted back.

<blank>

Damn ......, I knew I was shallow."

<blank>

Irving, standing behind Fluke, mutters in frustration.

Karen just stared wide-eyed in amazement at Irving, who had moved that far in just a few moments.

<blank>

The "! Bogebobo! Gobobobo!"

<blank>

Fluke's head was cut right across, but did not fall.

They are connected by a single layer of skin.

Fluke held it in his own hand and put it back in place, and the wounds connected like bubbles.

<blank>

"...... you're not human after all, are you?"

<blank>

The nightsword that Irving was holding broke off halfway through and fell off.

Irving gives a small click of his tongue when he sees the piece of the nightsword that fell noisily at his feet.

<blank>

This Irving suddenly clamped down on his mouth.

<blank>

"Oooooh!"

<blank>

A dribble of black blood dripped from between the fingers that had been placed over his mouth.

Blood dripping from his pants is beginning to form a pool at his feet.

<blank>

Mr. Haggard?

<blank>

When Karen saw this, she screamed.

Karen is sitting on the cobblestones on the spot. She has no strength left to stand.

Still, Karen's mind raced to get as close to Irving as possible, and she scratched the cobblestones with her fingers.

<blank>

No problem. It's just a little open wound."

Oh no! What a little ......!"

<blank>

Irvin turns to Karen and lightly raises his left hand to tell her, "No problem.

And just like that, he spat out the remaining clots of blood in his mouth.

<blank>

<blank>

--What is this guy? What is it? Is it undead? No, he's alive.

If it's the undead, the zombie soldiers that spring up in the shallow layers are much worse quality.

They are much faster and stronger. A simple slash to the head is not enough to stop them.

These guys are just tough by comparison.

I knew I had to crush your head and heart to finish. ......

You have to be willing to crush even one of your own arms because the nightsword is like this.

I've been feeling a bit queasy around the chest. ...... My eyes have been rolling around since a while ago, and it hasn't gone away. ......

Did I bleed too much?

Well, we can't cut corners here. It's about to get bad. ...... We've got to get this over with before it becomes a big problem.

<blank>

Let's get this over with."

<blank>

Irving lightly thrust his left hand forward and took a stance as if to carry his nightsword, which was broken in the middle of its body, on his shoulder.

<blank>

Gahya bhaiya bhaiya! But it's a boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle boodle! Dame dey yagoda odeba doe yagoda! Ode ga gode yadzagigiga de yagudo! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

<blank>

"Really? I think if you push yourself a little bit, you can get by, don't you?"

Geba-gya-gya! Elephant!"

<blank>

Fluke swings the cudgel in his hand.

As the magical light spilled from it, one of the canine magical beasts turned and ran toward Karen.

<blank>

? You!"

<blank>

Irving quickly turns his attention back to the running magical beast.

Then, he swung his nightsword, which carried the "Ki" he had momentarily accumulated.

<blank>

Slash Impact!"

<blank>

Irving shouts the name of the technique, and a shock is released from the nightsword.

<blank>

It is a skill called "Impact-type" that sends the sword ki flying, which Suzy uses.

Irving had long since become proficient in its use.

Although it was not powerful, Irving had released it less than a month after he was taught.

The incident in the past, when Suzy saw this, her eyes turned white and her jaw, which had been open for a while, would not close.

<blank>

<blank>

The impact released caught up with the magical beast in an instant and sliced through its waist.

The screaming magical beast rolled up to Karen's doorstep, jittery and writhing.

<blank>

At the same time, a small piece of the nightsword falls at Irving's feet.

<blank>

Tsk!"

<blank>

Fluke's cudgel falls on Irving's head.

Irving slashes at the arm as he dodges, but not before dropping the arm.

The wound that spurts out blood is repaired in a matter of seconds.

<blank>

"You bastard, stalling for time with your boring ......"

Gee whiz! What's wrong? I'm not going to let you get away with this! I can't get out of your face!

"You asshole! I'm not going to hurt you, so let me do it! I don't have time for this!

"Don't you dare! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

<blank>

<blank>

This fucking brat is in a hurry because he's about to get himself beat up.

With this body and power, I can surely kill this kid no matter what kind of user he is.

Somehow, it seems like your body is already falling apart.

In less than a few days, he should run out of stamina and be unable to move.

Moreover, his sword was broken in the middle. There was no way he could use it.

It's only a matter of time now.

<blank>

On the other hand, the more time passes, the more power floods into my body. I have no intention of losing at all.

The sense of omnipotence that pervades me is extraordinary. There is no one who can compete with me now.

<blank>

If I twist this brat to death, that woman is next.

I take the stone and tap back a thank you for doing whatever I wanted earlier.

I will torture you to the fullest until your body is ripped open!

<blank>

Geegabya-bye hiya-gyagyagyagya! Zaah! Buchidoji de yangyago! Gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee!

<blank>

He continues to laugh fearlessly as he contemplates the play of violation that Fluke is about to perform.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, the earth shook.

<blank>

I felt the impact of some huge object falling on my feet and in the air, and my body shook.

<blank>

Oh, ......, time's up."

<blank>

Irving muttered quietly, as if he had given up.
