# 135 Susie Cloud is Very Angry

I'm thinking, "What about ......? What about ............? ... Huh? Haaaaaa～～～～～?

<blank>

I can't believe it! I can't believe this guy!

<blank>

What are you talking about, Irving? Did you just let him go? Did you release it? Did you release it? I don't know what you mean! I don't know what you mean!

<blank>

I'm not going to let you do that! Calm down first!"

<blank>

'Calm down, will you? Don't you have to explain first? Why don't you do your duty of explanation? Alright! Clench your teeth! I'll hit you first!

<blank>

Mia!!!!"

Sue! Calm down!

Hahaha mupyu! Myu-myu-nu!!!!"

<blank>

I'm going to give Irving a stroke," he said as he stepped forward! Just before he was about to step out, he was quickly caught in a bad meat hold and his movements were blocked!

Oh my God, Irving! You obviously look relieved!

You saved my life!

<blank>

I give up on moving my feet forward for now, but I will open my mouth!

Yes, I'm not moving from this spot! I'm not moving from this spot, though! Mwah!

<blank>

If you had just caught him there, the whole thing would have been over!

<blank>

Mmmmmm.

<blank>

I said, "No, you can't, it's too much to catch him there!"

What's so sensible about Irving's behavior? Nyumu!"

That's terrible, isn't it?

<blank>

Irving's habit of looking shocked.

But I know that it is a performance! I know that it is a performance!

I don't even think about it, but I know that Bibi has instructed me to keep up appearances just for the sake of appearances! Mmmmmm!

<blank>

At first I was going to catch him and make him tell me everything. But he blabbered on and on and on. Why should I hold on to him?

<blank>

Mmm, mmm, mmm.

<blank>

I also remembered that Miss Koh had apparently been keeping tabs on their movements. I wondered if it would be better to let them swim? I thought, "Well, since it's Miss Kohara, what do you think she's going to do about it? I'm sure she's got a background on them anyway.

Nyum?"

I went to the consul general immediately afterward to report the incident, and he promptly sent out the security guards he had prepared."

<blank>

It means we were ready!"

Bibi?"

<blank>

I am very sorry for the delay in informing you, Miss!"

To AnnaMarie?"

<blank>

According to AnnaMarie, not only her uncle, but also the Guard, the Knights of Honor, and even the Dekenberu city defense organization are working on it or something.

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ......?

<blank>

"In short, you need the back books and client lists they're involved with, so you're keeping them swimming ...... to get the backstory?"

<blank>

I am sure you know what I am talking about, my lady. And where are the secrets hidden in the multiple hideouts? We must find out.

<blank>

When I blurted out, "Why don't you just crush that thing from one side ......? AnnaMarie answered with a straight face, "We don't have the manpower.

Well, you have to go around the city licking the streets, that's true!

<blank>

In short, this incident was within the expected range, so there was no need for me to be concerned about it. I should be quiet and still.

Fumyu. .......

<blank>

"So ............, yes, I see. I understand."

<blank>

I slowly left Mia ...... and went to ......, although I really missed her. I turned toward the exit of the lounge.

<blank>

Well, I'm off for the night.

I'm going to go to ............ Anta. Did you really figure that out?

I understand, okay? Well, good night."

""............""

<blank>

For some reason, everyone was looking at me with a suspicious look, but I didn't care and hurried to my room.

<blank>

Well, just because I know what I'm doing doesn't mean I'm not going to do anything about it! Ummm!

<blank>

I see what you mean. So your uncle is also moving.

I should say that it is not surprising, since it is cumulative to Annie. ......

Then shall we visit your uncle directly here?

<blank>

But I know that I can't visit your mansion at this hour of the night.

It is almost 9:00 p.m.

If I go outside now, I'm totally breaking curfew.

It's long past curfew, and if I do that, they will think I've snuck out of the dorm.

<blank>

I'm actually getting out of it!

<blank>

This would cause unnecessary concern.

That's something I'd like to avoid if at all possible. ...... At least for now! Mm!

<blank>

Then I'm not going to wait that long for ...... tomorrow in the morning!

That's too late, because I'm planning to move tonight!

<blank>

What if, by any chance, they attack us in the middle of the night?

I don't think the security arranged by your uncle would be a setback, but still! There is no need for such a thing.

Above all, I can't let Karen and the twins be scared any more than they already are.

No matter what anyone says, we should turn down our sorrows tonight!

We have to use our strength! That's what they say! So to speak!

<blank>

I'm not sure what the problem is, but I don't have any information on the other party....

If we were to search in the dark in the downtown area or near a slum, I don't think we'd find what we're looking for tonight.

I'd like to clear the area like I thought before, but that's not going to happen, is it? Bibi's cold eyes are a vision.

I know, I won't do it. I won't do that!

<blank>

Well, I don't know what to do. ...... Speaking of which, Irving said that it sounded like you know, "Miss" was in possession of some information? ...... Hmmm.

Oh, and could that thing be useful by any chance? I'll give it a shot.

<blank>

<blank>

Now that we've decided on a night out, let's get ready for a little bit.

As expected, I can't just wander around in uniform, can I?

<blank>

The things I brought from the village stand out in their own way, too.

It's impossible to walk around downtown or slums in a flouncy skirt and not be noticed.

But other than that, all the hunting equipment and such is in AnnaMarie's care. ......

<blank>

............No wonder, it's been a while since I've pulled equipment from my inventory. What do you think would be good?

<blank>

I guess this is a safe bet. ...... zero rank light equipment "Hard Leather Armor"

I think this would be, well, less conspicuous.

It is made like a mini-skirted one-piece, and the color is an austere moss green, so it is relatively subdued. The thick brick-colored leather belt around the waist is a little point.

Two toggle buttons fasten the front.

It is attached in three places, which is quite cute.

The feet are short boots with ankle-high lacing. The color is chocolate and the heel is about 5 cm.

And charcoal gray over-knee socks. The absolute area is just a little bit wider.

<blank>

<blank>

With this leather equipment, it would not be too noticeable.

I'm sure you'll see it around the young lady hunters, won't you?

I'm sure they won't think I'm a student of the quintessential lady's school, Milia. Duh!

<blank>

Well then! I guess I'll start my nightly cleaning!

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Gone!"

'Vivi! You're really gone!"

Mia! Let's hurry up and head to our rooms!"

Yes!"

<blank>

<blank>

I knew he wasn't here! ...... through the window!"

But it's amazing how quickly you can lose your presence.

The head minister was right! Suzy is completely obliterated!"

I'm not going to find this one on my way out, am I?"

I knew there was something fishy about the way he pulled up from the lounge so quickly!"

"I hope I don't do anything, ....... Impossible?"

I'm sure you've already done it!"

<blank>

I'll go to bed in place of Sue-chan to deceive the dormitory supervisor's eyes! I have no choice but to get into bed in place of Sue-chan and fool the dormitory supervisor's eyes!

What are you talking about? You're too tall for me! I'll stay here and you can make your own bed!"

"Oh? Oh, no ......, an opportunity to enjoy Sue's bed ......"

When I come back, I'll have a word or two or three or four! I'll give you a good talking to!"

"Oooooo ......, Sue's warmth oooo ......"
