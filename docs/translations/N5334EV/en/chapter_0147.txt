# Chapter 135: Suzy Cloud is Very Angry

「……What?…………What?! ...Huh?!! Haaaah～～～～～?！！！！」

<b>

I can't believe it! I can't believe this guy!!

<b>

「What are you saying, Arvin?! You just let them go? Released them?! What does that even mean?! I don’t get it, okay?!」

<b>

「W-wait, Suzy! First, calm down!」

<b>

「Calm down?! Shouldn't you explain first?! Fulfill your duty to clarify?! Alright! Grit your teeth! For now, I'm going to punch you once!!」

<b>

「Mia!!」

「Su-chan! Calm down!!」

「Hanyumupyu! Myumyunuu!!」

<b>

Just as I was about to give Arvin a good swipe, I was suddenly caught in a deadlock hold, immobilizing me!

You scoundrel, Arvin! You clearly look relieved!!

You just barely escaped with your life!

<b>

For now, I’ll give up on moving my feet, but I will speak!

Yes! I won’t move from this spot! Munyuu!

<b>

「If you had caught them there, everything would have been resolved, right!!」

<b>

Mumunyu.

<b>

「It’s impossible! Catching them there was just too much!」

「What are you saying, Arvin? Since when do you talk about common sense? Nyu!」

「Isn't that harsh?!」

<b>

Arvin, of all people, looks shocked.

But I know! I know that it’s just an act!

He doesn’t really feel anything, but he’s trying to maintain appearances, as he learned from Vivi!! Mumumunyu!

<b>

「At first, I thought I’d catch them and make them spill everything. But they started talking freely. There was no reason to keep them captured, right?」

<b>

Nyu, munyunyuu.

<b>

「And then, I remembered that it seems the boss had a grasp on their movements. I thought maybe it would be better to let them swim free? Since the boss probably has everything checked out anyway」

「Nyu?」

「Right after that, when I went to report to the consul general, they immediately sent out the prepared guards.」

<b>

「So, they were ready!」

「Vivi?」

<b>

「I sincerely apologize for the delayed report, young lady!」

「Even Anna Mary?」

<b>

According to Anna Mary, not only my uncle but also the guard team, the knights, and the Dekkenberg city defense organization are all mobilizing.

Hmm, hmm, nyum, hmm……?

<b>

「In other words, they’re letting them swim free to gather the under-the-table accounts and customer lists they’re involved with…?」

<b>

「You are correct, young lady. Furthermore, we must also investigate where the secrets are hidden among the multiple hideouts.」

<b>

I muttered, “They should just crush them all…” and Anna Mary replied with a serious face, “We simply don’t have enough personnel.”

Well, we have to search the entire city, so that makes sense!

<b>

In short, this incident was within the predicted range from the start, so I don’t need to worry. It seems I should just stay quiet and behave.

Fumyu…….

<b>

「So…… that’s how it is. I understand now.」

<b>

I slowly pulled away from Mia…… and though it’s quite regrettable…… I headed toward the exit of the lounge.

<b>

「Well then, I’ll be taking the night off.」

「…………Did you really understand?!」

「I got it, okay? Well then, good night!」

「「「…………」」」

<b>

For some reason, everyone is looking at me suspiciously, but I hurriedly made my way to my room without caring.

<b>

Well, just because I understand what’s going on doesn’t mean I won’t do anything! Um!!

<b>

I see, my uncle is also on the move.

Since it’s affecting Annie as well, it’s only natural, but…….

Should I ask my uncle directly?

<b>

But I know I can’t just drop by the mansion at this hour.

It’s already around 9 PM.

If I go out now, it would completely break curfew.

Even though curfew has long passed, if I do that, I would be thought to have snuck out of the dorm.

<b>

I am actually going to sneak out though!

<b>

If that happens, it would cause unnecessary worry.

I’d like to avoid that…… at least for now! Um!

<b>

Then I’ll wait until tomorrow morning…… but I don’t have the luxury to wait like that!

It would be too late, so I plan to act tonight!

<b>

What if, by any chance, there’s an attack in the middle of the night?

I don’t think the security arranged by my uncle would be late, but still! It’s better if there’s nothing at all.

More than anything, I can’t let Karen and the twins feel scared any more than they already have.

No matter what anyone says, I should eliminate any worries tonight!

It’s all about taking action! That’s the way to go!!

<b>

But the problem is that I have no information about the enemyーー.

Even if I search the downtown area or the slums aimlessly, I don’t think I’ll find what I’m looking for tonight.

I’d rather just flatten that area like I thought before, but of course, I can’t do that. I can almost see Vivi’s cold gaze in my mind.

I know, I won’t do such a thing!

<b>

Now then, what should I do…… Speaking of which, according to Arvin, it seems that the “boss” had some information?…… Hmm.

Oh, and could that also be useful? I think I’ll give it a shot.

<b>

<b>

Now that I’ve decided on the plan for tonight’s outing, I should get ready.

I can’t just wander around in my uniform!

<b>

The things I brought from the village are also quite conspicuous.

Walking around downtown or the slums in a frilly skirt is just asking for attention.

But all my other hunting gear is with Anna Mary……

<b>

……Well, I guess I’ll have to pull out some gear from my inventory for the first time in a while. What would be good?

<b>

I guess this is the safest choice…… Zero-rank light armor “Hard Leather Armor.”

With this, I don’t think I’ll stand out too much.

It’s made like a mini-skirt dress, and the color is a subdued moss green, so I think it’s relatively plain. The thick brick-colored leather belt that cinches the waist is a nice touch.

The front is secured with two toggle buttons.

There are three of them, and they’re quite cute.

On my feet, I’ll wear short lace-up boots that cover my ankles. The color is chocolate, and the heel is about 5 centimeters?

And charcoal gray over-the-knee socks. The absolute territory is a little wider.

<b>

<b>

With this leather gear, I shouldn’t stand out too much.

I think a young female hunter might notice me?

There’s no way I’d be mistaken for a student of Millia’s elite school. Yup!

<b>

Alright! Then I’ll get ready for tonight’s cleaning adventure!

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

「She’s gone!」

「Vivi-chan! She really disappeared!?」

「Mia! Let’s hurry to the room!」

「Okay!」

<b>

<b>

「She’s really not here!…… Did she go out the window?」

「But it’s surprising, she really disappears without a trace.」

「Just as the boss said! “Suzy completely erases her presence!”」

「If she’s escaped, we won’t be able to find her.」

「I thought it was suspicious how easily she pulled away from the lounge!」

「As long as she doesn’t do anything reckless, it should be fine…… but that’s impossible.」

「I’m sure she’ll do something reckless!」

<b>

「Then! I guess I’ll have to get into bed in Suzy’s place and fool the dorm supervisor!」

「What are you saying! You’ll be found out because of your height! I’ll stay, so you take care of my bed!」

「Wha?! N-no way…… I finally have a chance to enjoy Suzy’s bed……」

「When you come back, I’ll give you a lecture or two or three or four! You’ll hear plenty!」

「Ugh…… Suzy’s warmth……」
