# Chapter 01: Suzy Awakens in the Forest

I have always been a reader, but this is my first time posting! Writing a novel and crafting long sentences is a completely new experience for me. My writing may be clumsy, but I would be happy if you could look at it with warm eyes!

I have written from the prologue to the first chapter, so I have scheduled to release one episode every day at 8 PM. I would be grateful if you could join me if you have the time.

<b>

Fluffy white cumulus clouds reminiscent of early summer rise up, and beyond them, a clear sky blue stretches endlessly.

And right beneath it, a deep green forest continues to spread just like the sky.

Behind the forest, white mountains tower, shrouded in purple smoke, lined up like a wall.

<b>

It was a scene where waves of deep trees reached the horizon, resembling a vast sea of green.

<b>

In this sea of trees, a gentle breeze blew, causing the deep green waves to sway, and there was a place where the trees had been swept away.

A wide space, devoid of grass, where rocks and clumps of earth were exposed like a wasteland.

In this open area, there was a single elevated spot that rose, overlooking the space.

On top of that elevated spot, partially covered by vegetation, stood a solitary figure quietly and secretly.

<b>

<b>

A still figure that exuded an unassuming presence.

The short bob of red hair, spreading out as if bouncing outward, shimmered like rubies when the sunlight filtered through, standing out even more in the deep green.

The bangs flowing from right to left swayed in the wind, gently brushing against the left eyelid.

<b>

Both eyes were closed, but the slender eyebrows hinted at the strength of the person's will.

A small but well-shaped nose with a defined bridge.

The lightly closed small lips were a pale pink, glistening with light.

The rounded lines of the cheeks, retaining a hint of youth, continued down to a small chin.

It was the face of a beautiful woman with doll-like features.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Her graceful form was wrapped in sturdy plate armor.

<b>

The body, based on a dark green color, shone with a jade hue in the light.

Multiple silver lines intertwined in straight and curved patterns, decorating the surface as if thorns and vines were entwined.

It was supposed to be solid armor, yet there were many exposed areas.

The upper arms and thighs revealed white skin to the outside.

The chest area was also wide open, and the well-shaped white valley of her bosom was hard to ignore.

<b>

The belt-like waist armor curved loosely to expose the lower abdomen, revealing the area around the navel.

From there, the skirt-like armor hung down, hiding the inner thighs but also showcasing the outer thighs in a manner reminiscent of a dancer's costume with large slits.

<b>

<b>

<b>

A pale pink mantle fluttered in the wind behind her.

<b>

The shoulder of the mantle was adorned with decorations resembling overlapping feathers in gold and silver.

On the back, sharp, blade-like feather patterns were depicted in deep crimson, and the edges of the fabric were embroidered with designs of entwined vines in gold and silver threads.

<b>

<b>

<b>

And in her hands were weapons that seemed too rugged for a woman to wield.

<b>

The blade, about 70 to 80 centimeters long, shone in a dull brass color and appeared thick enough to easily cut through beast bones.

The width of the blade gradually increased from the tip towards the hilt.

About a third of the way from the hilt, thorn-like protrusions began to emerge, leading to a sword guard with sharp, lightning-like ridges resembling bat wings.

In the center of the sword guard, a deep red gem was embedded, and from there, a relief resembling a beast's skull was carved towards the tip of the blade.

From there, ruby-red reliefs resembling veins spread towards the thorny parts.

<b>

The grip was a 30-centimeter-long cone, wrapped with reddish-brown fibers for a non-slip grip.

The pommel was decorated with designs reminiscent of a halo, centered around a gem.

Furthermore, the blade was surrounded by a blue aura, crackling and emitting light.

<b>

Two such ominous-looking swords were gripped, one in each hand.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now, in her stillness, a quiet movement was about to begin.

<b>

Her cheeks were gently caressed by the wind, contracting adorably and slightly.

Her chest rose significantly as she took a slow, deep breath.

Her eyelids twitched, and slowly, her eyes opened.

As her eyes opened, a pale green light reflected like the shimmering surface of water.

With her eyelids raised halfway, it became clear that the reflection was from cobalt green eyes, reminiscent of the clear seas of the South Seas.

As her eyes fully opened, it was as if she had awakened from a long dream, and her pupils slowly focused, eventually beginning to light up.

Though slightly slanted, her large eyes, spilling with light, gradually filled with reason.

<b>

Then, slowly turning her head to look around, her brows furrowed in suspicion as her lips moved.

Her lips slowly parted, and words escaped.

<b>

"Eh? What is this??"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Eh? What is this??"

<b>

She repeated once more.

<b>

(Where is this? And is that my voice right now??)

<b>

(What’s in my hands... I’m holding the Neme sword... And I’m wearing armor... right?)

<b>

(And, um... this is... my chest, right??)

<b>

Thinking such things, she poked at her chest with her fingertips, confirming the soft sensation.

<b>

"I want a mirror! I demand a mirror!!!"

<b>

She shouted into the void, but her voice faded among the trees.

<b>

(...Okay, calm down! First, remember!!)

<b>

Furrowing her brows, she closed her eyes and placed her fingers on her forehead. For now, she would trace back her memories from what was clear.

<b>

(After returning from work, I ate, took a shower, turned on the PC, and logged into the game as usual...)

<b>

<b>

It was an MMORPG that she had been playing for over ten years.

She started when she was 19, so it was already her 13th year.

Over the course of ten years, she had taken numerous breaks and returned, and now she was still casually continuing her routine.

Rather than leveling up a specific character, she enjoyed raising the levels of multiple characters evenly, so her characters were generally low in skill.

While the game's max level was 150, her highest character level was below 100.

<b>

To top players, she was an ordinary person, a weak character.

<b>

Using such weak characters, she completed daily quests and chatted casually with friends, enjoying a laid-back playstyle.

<b>

In her last memory, after hunting with friends and completing daily quests, she had a day off the next day and was chatting excitedly with her friends...

<b>

"I must have dozed off..."

<b>

She clapped her hands in realization.

<b>

"This is a dream!"

<b>

She concluded.

<b>

(In other words, I’m actually in the character I was using in the game! ...Is this a dream!!)

<b>

"Got it! So this is what they call a lucid dream~~. ...I read about it a lot online, but it’s this clear! Amazing!!!"

<b>

The Enchant Channeler "Suzy"

A female human mage character, that was the character she had last used.

<b>

The "Enchant Channeler" is a support class.

Her main job is to use enchant skills to enhance party members.

She can also heal to some extent and can equip heavy armor, so she can manage frontline roles and can even solo if she pushes herself.

Thus, she found it convenient and used it as her main character.

<b>

"But still, being in Suzy's body..."

<b>

Looking down at her body, she twirled around.

<b>

"I guess I have some pent-up desires...?"

(I should go to Isezaki-cho soon.)

<b>

Thinking while enjoying the sensation of touching the white valley of her chest peeking out from the armor.

<b>

"But hey! Since it’s a dream, playing as a woman is fine!"

<b>

She seemed to have accepted it.

<b>

<b>

"So, where is this? What forest is this? The map... isn’t showing up?"

<b>

In the game, she could pull up a map to know her current location, but now, no map or window appeared.

Looking around, it seemed she was right in the middle of a deep forest.

The place she was standing was higher than others, offering a good view, but she couldn’t see the end of the surrounding forest.

<b>

Right in front of this elevated spot, the trees had been cleared, creating a space like a plaza.

It was about the size of an athletic field.

In this space, no grass grew, and the ground was exposed, with rocks of various sizes scattered about like a wasteland.

<b>

(Is this a deserted campsite? Or some kind of event space?)

<b>

"But it feels strangely realistic... It would be nice if at least a window would pop up. The radar... oh, does that mean it’s available? I can tell where the mobs are."

<b>

The radar wasn’t displayed on her screen, but it was a function that showed nearby mobs as dots, allowing her to recognize their locations.

<b>

"Mobs" is short for Moving Objects.

Generally, it means crowds (mobs), but in the game Suzy was in, it referred to NPCs that acted hostile, like monsters.

<b>

(Is it more like I "know" rather than "see"? If I could think of it like GPS, it would be easier to understand... It really feels like I "know" intuitively. It’s a strange sensation♪ ...But there are quite a few of them...)

<b>

Trying to see if she could gather more information, she focused on one she recognized.

<b>

(I can sense the distance and strength... Everyone has a blue image, though!)

<b>

In the game, opponents with a level difference were displayed in different colors.

"Blue" indicates a weak opponent that is more than 25 levels lower than her.

Right now, she couldn’t see the colors; she just "knew" it.

<b>

(The closest one is about 25 to 26 meters to the right and behind me from this elevated spot, huh?)

<b>

"For now, let’s play it safe and go for it♪"

<b>

The back of this elevated spot sloped steeply.

She dashed down from the elevated spot towards the nearest target...

<b>

(What about skills... oh, this one. Like this?!)

<b>

"I’m drawing it out!"

<b>

《Assault Dash》

A skill of the Enchant Channeler.

It allows her to rush towards an enemy at high speed, stunning them for a short time.

It’s a standard first move for a Channeler.

<b>

<b>

She lowered her posture, pointing the two blades she held towards the enemy and kicked off the ground.

<b>

In that moment, her body transformed into an embodiment of destruction, surpassing the speed of sound.

<b>

With a thunderous roar that shattered the sound barrier, she crushed the trees in her path and closed the distance of about 20 meters in an instant, reaching her target.

<b>

"Did it explode!!??"

<b>

What had appeared to be a massive beast, which should have been an ominous presence, burst apart at that moment.

<b>

To slow down, she dug her feet into the ground, scraping the earth as she continued for another 10 meters before coming to a stop.

Leaving behind vicious claw marks on the ground.

<b>

"…That was a bit of an overkill."
