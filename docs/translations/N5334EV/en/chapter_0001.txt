# 01: Suzy Awakens in the Forest

I've only ever read stories before, but this is my first time posting anything! It's also my first time writing a novel or writing a long story. My writing is probably not very good, but I'd be happy if you could read it with a warm heart!

I've written the first chapter, so I've made a reservation to publish one chapter every day at 8pm. I'd be happy if you could take the time to read it.


----------------

<blank>

The white cumulus clouds that remind you of early summer stretch up high, and beyond them, the clear, sky-blue sky stretches out endlessly.

And directly below that, a deep green forest stretches out endlessly, just like the sky.

Behind the forest, the white mountains rise up, shrouded in a haze of smoke and stretching out like a wall.

<blank>

It was like a vast ocean of green, with waves of deep trees stretching as far as the eye could see, reaching to the very edge of the horizon.

<blank>

Amidst the deep green waves of the forest sea, where the wind blew and the trees swayed, there was a place where the trees had been cleared away.

It was a wide space, bare of plants and shrubs, with rocks and clods of earth exposed like a wasteland.

There is a single hill that rises up above this open space, as if looking down on it.

A single figure was standing quietly and secretly on top of this hill, which was covered in plants but also revealed patches of bare rock.

<blank>

<blank>

A quiet presence that stands still, without making a big impression.

Her short bob of red hair, which seemed to be bouncing around outside, fluttered in the wind and, as it caught the sunlight, it scattered light like a ruby, standing out even more brilliantly against the deep green.

The bangs, which flowed from right to left, swayed in the wind and gently brushed her left eyelid.

<blank>

Her eyes are closed, but her thin eyebrows seem to hint at the strength of her will.

Her nose is small but well-shaped.

Her lightly closed lips are a light pink tinged with light.

The rounded lines of her cheeks, which still retain a hint of childishness, lead down to her small chin.

It was the face of a beautiful woman with a doll-like, well-proportioned appearance.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Her supple body was clad in sturdy plate armor.

<blank>

The body, which was based on a dark green color, shined with a jade green color in the light.

The surface is decorated with a combination of straight and curved lines, and with thorns and ivy clinging to it.

It is supposed to be a solid piece of equipment, but there are also many exposed parts.

Her upper arms and thighs were also exposed, revealing her white skin.

Her chest was also wide open, and the white valley between her well-shaped breasts was impossible to ignore.

<blank>

The waistband-like belt curved loosely to show off her lower abdomen, revealing her navel.

The grass skirt that hangs down from there, while concealing the inner thighs, also reveals the outside of the thighs, like the costume of a dancer with a large slit, and is also white and attractive.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The pale pink cloak is fluttering in the wind at the back.

<blank>

The shoulders of the cloak are decorated with layers of gold and silver feathers.

The reverse side also has a pattern of sharp-angled feathers, like blades, painted in a deep reddish purple, and the edges of the fabric are embroidered with ivy entwined in gold and silver thread.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And in her hand is a weapon that is too rough for a woman to hold.

<blank>

The blade, which is 70 to 80 centimeters long, is a dull brass color and is so thick that it seems to be able to easily cut through even animal bones.

The blade gradually becomes wider as it goes from the tip to the handle.

From about one-third of the way from the hilt, spines-like protrusions began to appear, leading to the sword guard, which had sharp, uneven edges like a lightning bolt, with the wings of a bat spread out behind it.

In the center of the sword guard, a deep red gemstone was embedded, and from there, a relief carving of a beast's skull was also carved, leading to the tip of the blade.

From there, a relief of ruby-red veins spread out towards the spine.

<blank>

The handle is a conical shape about 30 cm long, and the grip is wrapped in a reddish-bronze fiber to prevent slipping.

The pommel is decorated with a design reminiscent of a halo, also centered on a jade stone.

Furthermore, the blade was surrounded by a blue aura and was emitting a crackling electric discharge.

<blank>

Two swords with such a menacing appearance were held in each hand.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now, as it stood still without moving, a quiet movement was about to occur.

<blank>

The cheeks were caressed gently by the wind, and they contracted into an adorable little shape.

The chest rose up high, and she breathed in deeply.

The eyes twitched, and the eyelids opened quietly.

In the eyes that open, a light green light reflects like the surface of the water shimmering.

With the eyelids halfway up, you can tell that it's the reflection of cobalt green eyes, like the clear southern sea.

The eyes, which have opened wide, slowly come into focus as if waking from a long dream, and the light begins to shine.

Her eyes, which are a little long and narrow, gradually become filled with reason as they open wide.

<blank>

Then, as she slowly turns her head to look around, her eyebrows furrow in confusion and her mouth moves.

Her lips slowly part and a word escapes.

<blank>

“What?!”

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

“Eh? Are you serious?”

<blank>

He repeated it again.

<blank>

(Where am I? Or rather, is that my voice?

<blank>

(In his hand... he's holding the Neme sword... And he's wearing a heavy coat...)

<blank>

(And... is this... his chest...?

<blank>

While thinking about such things, I poked my chest with my fingertips and checked the softness of the skin.

<blank>

“A mirror! I demand a mirror!"

<blank>

She shouts to no one in particular, but her voice fades away into the trees.

<blank>

(...let's calm down! First, remember! )

<blank>

She furrows her brows, closes her eyes, and places her fingers on her forehead. For now, let's try to remember from the parts that are clear.

<blank>

(After I get home from work, I eat dinner, take a shower, turn on my PC, and then I log into the game as usual...)

<blank>

<blank>

It's an MMORPG that I've been playing for over 10 years now.

I started when I was 19, so it's been 13 years now.

During the ten years, I've repeatedly stopped and started playing, and it's become a routine that I continue to play in a lazy way.

<blank>

Rather than raising a specific character to a high level, I enjoy playing by raising the levels of multiple characters evenly, so the level of my characters is generally low.

While the maximum level in the game is 150, the highest level of my characters is below 100.

<blank>

From the perspective of top players, he was just an ordinary player with a low-level character.

<blank>

He enjoyed playing the game in a relaxed way, using these low-level characters to complete daily quests and chatting with his friends.

<blank>

<blank>

Even in my last memories, after hunting with my friends and completing the daily quests, I was chatting with my friends and having a good time because the next day was a holiday...

<blank>

“I must have fallen asleep...”

<blank>

I clapped my hands in agreement.

<blank>

“Is this a dream?”

<blank>

I concluded.

<blank>

(In other words, I'm playing the game as the character I was using! ...or was it a dream?!)

<blank>

“I see, so this is what they call a lucid dream... I've read a lot about it online, but it's so clear! This is amazing!”

<blank>

Suzie, the Enchant Channeler

A female human mage character, that was the last character he used.

<blank>

'Enchant Channeler' is a support role.

Its main job is to use enchantment skills to strengthen party members.

It can also heal to a certain extent, and it can equip heavy equipment, so it can handle the front line to a certain extent, and if pushed, it can even solo.

So, I used it mainly because it was easy to use.

<blank>

“Even so, it's just like Suzy...”

<blank>

I looked down at my body and spun around.

<blank>

“I've got quite a lot of pent-up desire... I think?”

(Let's go to Isezakicho sometime soon)

<blank>

I thought, while enjoying the feeling of touching the white valley between my breasts that was visible through my armor.

<blank>

“But, well, it's just a dream, so it's okay to play with the female body!”

<blank>

It seems that I've come to terms with it.

<blank>

<blank>

“So, where am I? What kind of forest is this? Is there a map...?

<blank>

In the game, you could bring up a map to find out where you were, but now there's no map or window.

Looking around, it seems that I'm in the middle of a deep forest.

The place where I am standing is higher than the rest and has a good view, but I can't see the end of the surrounding forest.

<blank>

Right in front of this high ground, the trees have been cleared away to make a kind of open space.

I wonder if it's as big as an athletics stadium.

In this space, there are no plants or trees, and the bare earth is exposed, with large and small rocks lying around like a wasteland.

<blank>

(Is this the remains of a disused campsite? Or is it some kind of event space?)

<blank>

“But it's strangely realistic... It would be nice if there was at least a window. And the radar... oh, is that a good thing? I can see where the mobs are.”

<blank>

The radar is a function that displays nearby mobs as dots on the screen, allowing you to recognize their location, even though they are not displayed on the screen you are looking at.

<blank>

'Mob' is an abbreviation for 'Moving Object'.

It is generally used to mean a crowd, but in the game where Suzy was, it referred to NPCs such as monsters that acted in a hostile manner.

<blank>

(It's not like you can 'see' it, but you can 'understand' it, right? It would be easier to understand if you could imagine it like GPS... It's really a feeling of 'understanding' it. It's a strange feeling... but there are quite a few of them...)

<blank>

I tried to focus on one of the things I recognized to see if I could get some more information.

<blank>

(I can tell how far away they are and how strong they are...? Everyone's image is blue though!

<blank>

In games, opponents with a level difference are displayed in different colors.

'Blue' is a weak opponent who is at least 25 levels below you.

I can't see the colors right now, I just 'know' that's the case.

<blank>

(The nearest one is probably about 25 to 60 meters to the right and behind me, right?

<blank>

“Well, I'll just try it as a safety margin for now♪”

<blank>

The rear of this high ground is a steep slope.

I head towards the nearest target and run down from the high ground...

<blank>

(My skill is... ah, this. Is it like this?!)

<blank>

“I'll get you!”

<blank>

《Assault Dash》

Enchanted Channeler's skill

Rushes at the enemy at high speed, stunning them for a short time.

A standard skill for channelers to use first.

<blank>

<blank>

He pointed the two blades in his hands at the enemy and lowered his posture, kicking the ground.

<blank>

At that moment, his body, which had become the personification of destruction, exceeded the speed of sound.

<blank>

The roar of the sound breaking through the sound barrier roared around him, and in an instant he had reached his target, crushing the trees in his path and covering the 20-meter distance in an instant.

<blank>

“It's exploded!?”

<blank>

The thing that had looked like a huge beast, which must have been a malevolent existence, exploded in that instant.

<blank>

In order to apply the brakes, it dug its feet in and advanced another 10 meters or so, scraping the earth as it went.

Leaving a vicious claw mark in its wake.

<blank>

"……There's such a thing as overkill.”
