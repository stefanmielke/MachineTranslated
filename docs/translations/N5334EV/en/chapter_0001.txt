# 01 Waking up in the Suzy Forest

I have been a reader for a long time, but this is my first post! This is my first experience writing a novel or spelling out a long sentence. I hope you will warmly accept my poor writing!

I have written a chapter from the introduction to the first chapter, so I have reserved a story to be published at 8:00 p.m. every day. I would appreciate it if you could spare some time to read it.

<blank>

White cumulus clouds reminiscent of early summer are rising, and beyond them, the clear sky blue sky stretches endlessly.

And directly below, a large forest of deep green stretches out as far as the sky.

Behind the continuous forest, towering white mountains were lined up like a wall in a haze of purple smoke.

<blank>

It was like an ocean of green, with waves of deep trees reaching as far as the eye could see to the end of the horizon.

<blank>

In such a sea of trees, the wind was blowing and the waves of deep green were rolling, but there was only one place where the trees seemed to have been reaped.

It is a large space with no vegetation and bare rocks and dirt like a wasteland.

There is a raised plateau overlooking the plaza-like space.

A figure stood quietly and quietly on top of the rocky hill, which was covered with vegetation.

<blank>

<blank>

It stands quietly, without a sense of presence.

Her short bob of red hair, which bounces outward in the wind and shimmers like rubies in the sunlight, stands out even more prominently in the deep green surroundings.

Her bangs, flowing from right to left, swayed in the wind and gently brushed her left eyelid.

<blank>

Both eyes are closed, but the thin, flowing eyebrows suggest the strength of the person's will.

Small but well-shaped and well-striped nose.

The little lips, lightly closed, are light pink with light.

The rounded cheek line, which remained juvenile, led to a small chin.

It was the face of a beautiful woman with a doll-like appearance.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The graceful body is wrapped in a robust plate armor.

<blank>

The dark green base of the body glowed jade green in the light.

The surface is decorated with many lines of silver and white, combining straight and curved lines, like thorns and ivy.

It is supposed to be a solid piece of equipment, but there are many exposed areas of it.

The arms and thighs were also exposed to the outside, exposing their white skin.

The bosom is also wide open, and the white cleavage of the well-shaped twin hills cannot help but catch the eye.

<blank>

The belt-like waistband curves gently to show off the lower abdomen, exposing the navel area.

The grass skirt hanging back and forth from it, like a dancer's costume with a large slit that hides the inner thighs, also makes the outside of the thighs white and attractive.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A light red cloak fluttered in the wind at his back.

<blank>

The shoulders of the cloak are decorated with layers of gold and silver feathers.

On the back of the dress, too, a pattern of sharp-edged feathers like blades is painted in dark purple-red, and embroidery designed to look like tangled ivy is sewn into the edges of the fabric with gold and silver threads.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And in his hand is a weapon that is too heavy-duty for a woman to hold.

<blank>

The dull brass-colored blade is so thick that it could easily cut through the bones of a beast.

The blade width was gradually widened as one moved from the tip of the blade to the hand.

From about one-third of the way down, a spine-like projection begins to emerge, leading to a sword-like section with sharp, lightning-like bumps that resemble a bat with its wings spread backward.

In the center of the sword is a deep red boulder, from which is carved a relief that looks like the skull of a beast toward the tip of the blade.

From there, a vein-like ruby-red relief spread toward the spine.

<blank>

The grip is a cone about 30 cm long with a woven handle scroll made of reddish copper fiber to prevent slipping.

The handle head is decorated with a decoration reminiscent of rinko, also centered on a boulder.

In addition, the blade of the sword was covered with a blue aura and emitted a bee stinging discharge of light.

<blank>

Two swords, one in each hand, were held in the left and right hands, showing such an ominous aspect.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now, the way it had been standing there, not even moving, was about to quietly move.

<blank>

Her cheeks are gently caressed by the wind and contracted in lovely little circles.

His chest heaved heavily, and he breathed in deeply with uttaris.

The eyes twitch and their lids open silently.

The light green light reflects in the open eyes like the shimmering surface of the water.

The half-lidded eyelids rise to reveal the reflection of cobalt-green eyes, like those of the clear South Seas.

Eyes firmly open, they slowly came into focus as if awakening from a long dream, and eventually began to light up.

The eyes, slightly slanted but big enough to be spilling out, are gradually filled with reason.

<blank>

Then, slowly turning his head and looking around, he raised his eyebrows quizzically and his mouth moved.

Lips yukked open and words leaked out.

<blank>

Huh?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What? Huh?"

<blank>

I repeated it again.

<blank>

（Where am I? I mean, was that my voice?)

<blank>

(You have ...... in your hand and a neme sword. ...... (In your hand you have a neme sword ...... and in your hand you have a neme sword ...... and in your hand you are wearing an orajyu)

<blank>

(So, is this ......, or is this ...... chest, or ......?)

<blank>

Thinking of this, he poked his own chest with his fingertips and checked its soft texture.

<blank>

Mirror! I demand a mirror!!!!"

<blank>

He shouts to no one, but his voice fades into the trees.

<blank>

(...... Well, calm down! Remember first!!!!)

<blank>

I raise my eyebrows, meditate, and place my finger on my brow. Let's start from what is clear to remember.

<blank>

(After returning home from work, I ate dinner, took a shower, turned on my PC, and as usual, I turned on the game (......).

<blank>

<blank>

It's an MMORPG that has been going on for over a decade now.

I started when I was 19, so it's been 13 years now.

It is a routine that has been suspended and returned to many times over the past 10 years and continues to linger.

<blank>

The character skill level is generally low, as I play more for the enjoyment of raising and developing multiple characters to an even level, rather than raising a specific character to a higher level.

His character's highest level is below 100, whereas the game's canted level is 150.

<blank>

In the eyes of the top players, they are ordinary people, small fry characters.

<blank>

Using these small fry characters, I enjoyed playing warmly day after day, completing their daily queries and chatting idly with my friends.

<blank>

<blank>

Even in my last memory, after hunting with my friends and completing daily quests, I went goofed off and chatted with my friends ...... because the next day was a holiday.

<blank>

"You fell asleep. ......"

<blank>

Narhodo! and clap your hands.

<blank>

This is a dream!"

<blank>

He concluded.

<blank>

(In other words, I'm playing the game as the very character I used to use! ...... is a dream!!!)

<blank>

'Nahhhh, this is what lucid dreaming is all about! I've read a lot about it on the internet at ......, but it's so clear! Amazing!"

<blank>

Suzy," an enchantment channeler.

Human Mage female character, that was the last character he used.

<blank>

The "enchantment channeler" is a support position.

Their main job is to use enchantment skills to strengthen party members.

He can also heal to a certain extent, and can equip heavy equipment, so he can also perform a good amount of vanguard work and can solo if he has to.

So, I used it as my main source of ease of use in my opinion.

<blank>

And yet, I didn't realize that Suzy's still ......"

<blank>

I look down at my body and spin around and look at it.

<blank>

"I'm pretty craving ......, huh?"

(Let's go to Isezakicho one of these days...)

<blank>

I thought to myself, as I felt the white cleavage of her breasts peeking out from her armor and enjoyed the sensation of her breasts.

<blank>

But, hey, it's just a dream! It's a dream, so there's female body play!"

<blank>

They seem to have broken it down.

<blank>

<blank>

So, where are we? What forest is this? The map is at ......, why don't you answer it?"

<blank>

In the game, I could bring up a map and know my current location, but now there is no map or window.

Looking around, it seems that we are in the middle of a deep forest.

The spot where I am standing now has a higher vantage point than the others, but I can't see the end of the surrounding forest.

<blank>

Just in front of this elevation, trees have been cut down to form a square.

It is about the size of an athletic field.

Only in this space there was no grass or trees, and the surface of the ground was exposed, with rocks of various sizes lying around like a wasteland.

<blank>

(Ruins of an abandoned campground? Some kind of event space?)

<blank>

"But it's a strangely realistic spec. ....... It would be nice to at least have a window. Radar is ......, is it correct to say that there is radar?

<blank>

Radar is a function that displays dots of mobs that are not on the screen you are looking at, but are nearby and recognizes their location.

<blank>

Mob" stands for Moving Object.

It is generally used to mean a crowd (mob), but in the game Suzy was in, it referred to NPCs who acted hostilely, such as monsters.

<blank>

（It would be easier to understand if I could imagine a GPS-like image. ...... It's really a sensory "understanding". It's a strange feeling. ...... but there are quite a few of them. ......)

<blank>

I tried to deepen my concentration on one that I recognized to see if I could see any more information.

<blank>

(Do you know the distance and the strength of ......? I know they all look so blue!)

<blank>

In the game, opponents with different levels are indicated by color coding.

Blue" is a weak opponent who is at least minus 25 levels away from you.

I don't see the color now, I just "know" that it is so.

<blank>

(The closest he is to me is about 25-6 meters to the right rear, off this ledge.)

<blank>

Let's just call it a safety margin for now..."

<blank>

Behind this elevation is a steep slope.

Head to that target closest to you, running down from the high ground, .......

<blank>

(Skills can be found at ...... Ah, here. This is it?)

<blank>

I'll pull it out!

<blank>

Assault Dash.

Enchantment Channeler Skills

It rushes toward the enemy at high speed and stuns him for a short period of time.

It's a standard skill for a channeler's first move.

<blank>

<blank>

He pointed the two blades in his hands at the enemy, lowered his posture, and kicked the ground.

<blank>

At that moment, its body, which had become a destructive force, exceeded the speed of sound.

<blank>

The moment when the target is reached, smashing the trees in the line of fire and instantly closing the distance of about 20 meters, with a roar that breaks through the sound barrier and roars around it.

<blank>

The bomb!

<blank>

The thing that looked like a huge beast, which should have been an ominous presence, exploded at that moment.

<blank>

In order to brake, he drills his foot and moves forward another 10 meters, scraping the earth, and stops.

Leaving a vicious claw mark on the land.

<blank>

It's not even close to ...... overkill."
