# 198 A Sacred Vow

Thank you very much for your patience!

Shortly before the clock was about to point to the middle of 20:00.

The camp was all set up, most of the students had finished preparing their own meals, and the cleanup was complete.

Now it's time for a little free time.

The students were spending their time freely, some preparing for bedtime, some enjoying this time with like-minded people, and some preparing for tomorrow.

<blank>

There is a little elevation to the south of that campground.

It is a lookout point with a view of the Rohan volcano and the deep forest at its base.

During the daytime, it is one of the most popular viewing spots for tourists, but at night, when it is only faintly illuminated by a few lights, it is not as popular as it should be.

But now two figures can be seen moving quietly in that unpopular place.

<blank>

Look! Cody! The sky over there is so red even at this hour."

It's the reflection from the fissure eruption at the base of the mountain. The brightness of the lava is shifting into the gas flowing above.

<blank>

Karen Merlin and Cordilia Casper leaned over the railing of the observation deck and looked out at the northern sky, which reflected a fiery red color.

Below, a vast dark forest spreads out, surrounded by dappled pale blue lights, and from there, to the left, to the west, the lights of a bustling daytime town can be seen in the distance.

<blank>

Gas from the sulfur springs?"

It was scary at the time,......, but now it's one of our tourist attractions."

"............"

It's like a dream come true to be able to see those lights in peace with Karen like this. ......

...... Cody.

I remember when we were both here when we were much, much younger. Do you remember Karen?"

'Of course, Cody! I remember! That time you said, 'Maybe I'll see the light of a white vane flying through the woods,' and we both left the camp and came up together."

Yes, sir." Yes!"

<blank>

Shortly before they started getting ready for bed, they had left camp. Now they are reminiscing with each other over the view from the lookout.

<blank>

At first, Cordilia was understandably hesitant about the offense of leaving the camp.

However, when Cordilia muttered that she wanted to visit the place of memories, Lucille and Catherine, who were in the same group, pushed her out of the way to take over the cover-up.

<blank>

Despite this, it was another story of Lucille choking Catherine, who followed to take a peek at the precious pair and tried to throw off the cover-up.

<blank>

<blank>

But all I could see were the pale lights of the boundary posts dotting the forest, and when I said, 'That's really the gate to the land of the dead! I said, 'That's really the gate to the land of the dead!' ...... and Cody got really scared.

Karen?

I'm scared! I remember you crying and clinging to me! I remember it so well!

That's not because Karen said things in a very scary way! I was really, really, really, really scared!

Haha, sorry, sorry! Cody sorry! So don't hit me."

Oh my God!"

<blank>

Cordelia's mouth was aggravated for a moment, but then she let out a sigh as if she had given up. Still, her mouth relaxes a little, as if she is happy.

Now he turned to the west and looked at the lights of the city in the distance.

<blank>

Do you remember the honey bread from that store down the street?"

I remember! It was so good!"

I know, right? Karen always ate with powdered sugar all over her face!"

I'm not sure how to describe it! Oh, it's so good, I eat it like crazy. ......"

What about that jelly store at the end of the street where that bakery is located?"

Oh, remember?"

You used to take a loaf of bread from the bakery and have a scoop of coconut jam on it, didn't you?"

Yeah, right.

I knew it!" he said, "I knew it! Cuscus."

I'm just so delicious that I get carried away!"

I used to wipe your face with my handkerchief.

"...... thank you for your help in that regard."

Oh, yeah! And that ice cream store across the street!"

There it is: ......."

Karen loves the raspberry ice cream over there. ......

"...... something, I feel like all I do is eat ......"

Karen was such a great eater! Karen was such a fussy eater!"

"I don't think it was that bad. ...... I don't think it was that bad. ......?"

<blank>

As they reminisce about their childhood memories of playing together, the emotions of those days come back to them.

The city of Magnumtor, where the Casper family's mansion is located, was also a place of memories for the girls.

In the past, the Merlins used to visit the Casper family in Boltsunan every year.

Just as the parents were confirming their friendship, so were the children, who often played together in the streets.

<blank>

How are you, Uncle Baker?"

We still have freshly baked bread lined up early in the morning."

Is the old lady at the jelly store still running the store?"

Yes, I hear you are doing well.

What about the sister at the ice cream parlor?"

She got married last year and runs the store with her husband.

...... everyone is doing fine."

The town has changed drastically, but now everyone is opening stores just like they used to."

I see. ......, good."

<blank>

As Karen recounts her memories, her eyes narrow as she reminisces about those days.

As Cordelia gazes at his profile, something hot wells up from deep within her chest.

Karen cherishes her memories of that town as much as I do. I now know that she cherishes that town as much as I do.

I can't believe how happy that makes me feel. ......

<blank>

Cordilia looked up and placed her hand quietly on her chest, trying to control what was about to overflow from her eyes.

Then, after meditating slightly, he straightened his posture and turned his body toward Karen as if he had made up his mind.

<blank>

I took a deep breath to utter the first word, but for some reason I couldn't speak properly after that.

I had always wished to talk with Karen, and now we were able to talk so normally.

Just as I was about to say the most important thing, I felt a hardening sensation in the back of my throat.

His hands are shaking in a small way.

<blank>

This is something I have to say. It's something I've been meaning to say for a long time, but when the time comes to say it, I can't believe how painful it is to say it.

What if I say it and then get rejected for it ......?

Even though I know Karen would never do such a thing, as soon as the thought of such a thing occurs to me, I am afraid of it.

...... but still!

<blank>

"............ Oh, um! ...... Karen!"

<blank>

Still, I closed my eyes, squeezed out my voice, and called her name with all my heart and soul.

I finally found my voice.

But his voice is very faint, trembling and gravelly.

Karen turned her eyes in surprise at the sound of Cordelia's voice.

<blank>

Sorry about ........................."

<blank>

Karen's eyes widen even more when Cordelia apologizes to her as if she is pondering.

<blank>

You said, "...... Oh, I said things at the time that hurt you. I was only thinking of myself at that time. I didn't care about your feelings at all. I only pushed my own feelings and said terrible words. I wanted to apologize for that ...... for a long, long time. So,...... well,...... so really,............ really,I'm sorry."

<blank>

As if driven by something, Cordelia's words spilled out of her mouth one after another.

His voice was still trembling slightly as if he was trying to squeeze it out of him.

After the words flooded in, Cordelia looked down and would not look up.

The hand that was put down was tightly clenched and shaking slightly.

<blank>

Karen's eyes moisten as she looks at Cordelia.

<blank>

"Cody...... Cody!"

<blank>

Karen found herself reaching for her trembling hand as she called Cordilia's name.

<blank>

Sorry! I'm sorry, Cody! I'm sorry too!

Karen?

<blank>

Karen takes Cordelia's hand and looks her squarely in the eye.

<blank>

I wanted to apologize too! I was just being stubborn! I wasn't even honest with Cody!"

<blank>

Cody was scared. Cody was always hiding behind me. Now he is gathering up his courage.

<blank>

If you have a friend who can reach out to you, please take his or her hand. I'm sure that hand was extended with all the courage you could muster. But I am sure that you also need courage to take that hand. But please face the other person's courage.

<blank>

Dalton Banjo's words at that time passed through Karen's mind.

I'm the one who didn't have the courage! I told you long ago that we would always be together! I promised to protect you!

<blank>

The hand that held it was filled with strength. He then pulled Cordelia's hand to his chest.

At the same time, he takes a step forward with his foot.

<blank>

I was the one who was running away! I couldn't face Cody! I couldn't see his face! I wanted to talk to you like this, like we used to! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Cody!

<blank>

With each word, the distance between us grows closer.

Before I knew it, the two were staring at each other so closely that the tips of their noses were touching.

<blank>

"...... Karen! Karen!"

<blank>

Cordelia's heart choked up when Karen told her that she wanted to talk to him, saying that she couldn't face it as well as she did.

As it is, their foreheads touch softly, and they look at each other with tear-filled eyes.

<blank>

I'm sorry Cody! We'll always, always be together!"

Of course, of course, Karen! I'll always be with you!"

<blank>

They held each other's hands tightly. They gently touch each other's foreheads, but they still fidget with each other with their hearts.

<blank>

At some point, the tears that had been building up in their eyes overflowed, and at the same time, smiles appeared on their faces, as if they couldn't hold it in any longer.

<blank>

Tears and laughter escape their mouths.

The two shared the sensation of a lump in their chests that was slowly melting away.

In the depths of each other's eyes, they saw the same old connection.

<blank>

Cordelia took a quiet breath and adjusted her spilt smile.

And once again, he takes Karen's hand in a deep, gentle grip.

Their faces are still so close together that the tips of their noses are touching.

Cordelia quietly closed her eyes and spun out words as if she were intoning a solemn poem.

<blank>

"As Long as the Sun and the Moon: ......"

<blank>

Karen responded to Cordelia's words with a happy smile on her face, then immediately closed her eyes and followed Cordelia's words in a calm tone.

<blank>

To my eternal friend, Cordelia Casper: ......

"Staying True to Karen Merlin: ......"

<blank>

As if calling to each other's words, they weave their words together as if they are gently handing each other their thoughts and feelings on the other's name.

<blank>

"I solemnly swear."

<blank>

Finally, they both join their voices together to pledge themselves to each other.

<blank>

It was a vow of friendship made in the garden of the Merlin family when they were children.

The words are a pledge of friendship together, using a passage from a story the two young people saw together.

With the feelings of that time in mind, the two now exchange vows once again.

<blank>

I promise you, Karen! I will never leave you alone again!"

Yes! We'll be together forever and ever!"

This time, I will protect you no matter what, just like I promised!"

It's my job to protect Cody!"

<blank>

The two laugh like children and rub their foreheads against each other.

The warmth of the other person's body felt in our clasped hands makes me smile again with uncontrollable joy.

<blank>

I love Cody ......!"

"I love ...... me too! Karen!"

<blank>

The small lights of the observatory gently illuminated the joyful couple.

As if to make up for lost time, Karen's and Cordelia's hearts are filled with warmth.

And they both understood that they had regained an irreplaceable piece of themselves that they had lost within themselves.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The wind blew.

A small light stationed on the observation deck twinkles feebly.

From the shadows of the trees, where the lights did not reach, blew a line of wind that brought a chill.

Like a sticky filth, the shadows behind it slither and move.

<blank>

It's wonderful! It's really great!"

<blank>

Suddenly, Sole appeared from the shadows, clapping her hands.

Shadows taking human form clap their hands in the guise of being impressed as they applaud the play.

<blank>

It was wonderful! Very inspiring, Karen!"

<blank>

The wind carries clouds, covers the moon and blocks the stars.

<blank>

"............ Van Niven? Why are you here?

<blank>

The thing called Van Niven by Karen Merlin appeared before the girls without hiding its mocking eyes.
