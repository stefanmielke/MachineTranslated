# Chapter 198: Solemn Oath

Thank you for your patience!

----------------

<b>

Just before the clock hands point to half past eight.

The camp setup was all finished, and most of the students had already eaten the meals they prepared themselves and cleaned up afterwards.

Now, there was a little bit of free time.

The students were spending their time freely, some preparing for bed, some enjoying this time with friends, and others busy with preparations for tomorrow.

<b>

To the south of the campsite, there is a small hill.

It is an observation point overlooking the Rohan Volcano and the deep forest spreading at its foot.

During the day, it is one of the scenic spots frequently visited by tourists, but at this time of night, faintly illuminated, it is naturally devoid of visitors.

However, now, two figures can be seen quietly moving in this deserted place.

<b>

“Look! Cody! The sky over there is so red even at this hour!”

“It’s the reflection from the fissure eruption at the foot of the mountain. They say the brightness of the lava is reflecting onto the gas flowing above.”

<b>

Karen Merlin and Cordelia Casper were leaning over the railing of the observation deck, gazing at the northern sky reflecting a fiery red color.

Below them, a vast dark forest surrounded by scattered pale blue lights spread out, and to the left in the west, the lights of the town that had been bustling during the day could be seen in the distance.

<b>

“Is it gas from the sulfur springs?”

“At that time, I felt a sense of terror, but… now it has become one of the tourist attractions.”

“…………”

“To think that I could peacefully watch that light with Karen like this, it feels like a dream…”

“...Cody.”

“I remember when we were much younger and came here together. Do you remember, Karen?”

“Of course I do, Cody! I remember! Back then, we snuck out of camp thinking, ‘Maybe we can see the light of the Shirobean flying around in the forest!’”

“Yes! That’s right!”

<b>

A little before they began preparing for bed, the two had snuck out of camp. Now, they were reminiscing about the scenery from the observation deck.

<b>

Initially, Cordelia had shown hesitation about the act of sneaking out of camp, which was obviously against the rules.

However, when Cordelia murmured that she wanted to visit the place of their memories, Lucille and Catherine, from the same group, pushed her to go with their cover-up plan.

<b>

Nevertheless, it was another story that Lucille was seen strangling Catherine, who was trying to abandon the cover-up plan while sneaking a peek at the precious duo.

<b>

<b>

“But what we saw was only the pale blue lights of the barrier pillars surrounding the forest, and when I said, ‘That’s actually the gate to the land of the dead!’… you got so scared, Cody… Pff.”

“K-Karen?!”

“You were crying, saying ‘Scary! Scary!’ while clinging to me, and I remember it clearly!”

“T-That’s because Karen said it in a really scary way! I-I was really, really scared at that time!!”

“Ahaha, I’m sorry, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to scare you, Cody! So don’t hit me!”

“Geez!”

<b>

Cordelia pouted as if she was angry for a while, but eventually sighed in resignation. Still, her mouth loosened a bit with a hint of happiness.

Then she turned westward, looking at the distant lights of the town.

<b>

“Do you remember the honey bread from the shop on that street?”

“I remember! It was so delicious!”

“Right? You always ended up with powdered sugar all over your face when you ate it!”

“T-That’s because it was so good that I just got carried away and ate it…”

“What about the jelly shop at the end of the street where the bakery was?”

“I-I remember!”

“You used to take the bread you bought at the bakery and have them put a scoop of lingonberry jam on it, right?”

“Y-Yeah, that’s right.”

“You always ended up with jam all over your face! Hehe.”

“B-Because it was so good that I just got carried away!”

“I always wiped your face with a handkerchief, didn’t I?”

“...I appreciate that.”

“Right! And what about the ice cream shop across from that?”

“Oh, I remember…”

“You loved the raspberry ice cream there, didn’t you, Karen?”

“...I feel like I was the one eating all the time…”

“Because you were such a big foodie, Karen!”

“...I don’t think I was that much of one…”

<b>

As they talked about the memories of playing together in their childhood, the feelings from that time began to resurface for both of them.

Magnumtor City, where the Casper family’s mansion is located, was also a place of memories for them.

In the past, the Merlin family used to visit the Casper family in Boltsun every year.

Just as their parents confirmed their friendship, the children often played together around the town.

<b>

“I wonder if the baker is doing well?”

“He’s still putting out freshly baked bread early in the morning.”

“Is the old lady at the jelly shop still running her shop?”

“Yes, she’s still actively running her shop.”

“What about the lady at the ice cream parlor?”

“She got married last year and is running the shop with her husband.”

“...Everyone is doing well.”

“Although the town has changed completely, everyone is still running their shops like before.”

“Really… that’s great.”

<b>

As Karen reminisced, her eyes narrowed nostalgically.

From deep within Cordelia’s heart, something warm began to swell.

Karen, just like her, cherished the memories of that town. She realized that Karen still held that town dear, just as she did.

The joy of this realization was overwhelming…

<b>

Cordelia looked up to hold back the tears that were about to overflow and quietly placed her hand on her chest.

After a slight moment of closing her eyes, she straightened her posture as if she had made up her mind and turned her body towards Karen.

<b>

She took a deep breath to say the first word, but for some reason, her voice wouldn’t come out smoothly afterward.

She had longed for this moment to talk with Karen, and now they were talking so normally.

But as soon as she tried to say something important, a sensation like her throat tightening overwhelmed her.

Her hands trembled slightly.

<b>

This is something I must say. It’s a word I’ve wanted to say for a long time, yet when I try to say it, my chest feels so tight.

What if, after saying it, I get rejected because of it…?

Even though she knew Karen would never do such a thing, the moment that thought crossed her mind, it was terrifying.

…But still!

<b>

“...Um, um!… Karen!”

<b>

Even so, she closed her eyes and squeezed out her voice, calling her name with all her might.

Finally, she managed to speak.

However, her voice was very thin, trembling, and hoarse.

Karen, surprised by Cordelia’s voice, turned her gaze towards her.

<b>

“...I’m sorry.”

<b>

Cordelia, who seemed to be in distress as she apologized, made Karen widen her eyes even more.

<b>

“...I said something that hurt you back then. I was only thinking about myself at that time. I didn’t even consider your feelings at all. I just imposed my feelings on you and said terrible things. I’ve wanted to apologize for that… for so long. So… um… so really… I’m truly sorry.”

<b>

As if being driven by something, words spilled out of Cordelia’s mouth one after another.

Her voice, strained as it was, still trembled faintly.

After the words overflowed, Cordelia kept her head down and didn’t lift her face.

Her hands, which were lowered, were tightly clenched and trembling slightly.

<b>

Seeing Cordelia like this, Karen’s eyes began to well up.

<b>

“Cody… Cody!”

<b>

Before she knew it, Karen was reaching out her hand to Cordelia’s trembling hand while calling her name.

<b>

“I’m sorry! I’m sorry, Cody! I’m the one who should apologize!!”

“K-Karen?!”

<b>

Karen took Cordelia’s hand and looked directly into her eyes.

<b>

“I’ve wanted to apologize for so long! That was just me being stubborn! I also didn’t face Cordelia properly!”

<b>

The timid Cody, who always hid behind her. That Cody was now mustering her courage.

<b>

“If there’s a friend who reaches out their hand, please take that hand. Surely that hand is stretched out with all the courage they can muster. But surely, you too need courage to take that hand. However, please face that courage of the other person.”

<b>

The words of Dalton Banjo from that time passed through Karen’s mind.

It was her who lacked courage! Even though she had said they would always be together! She had promised to protect her!

<b>

Strength gathered in the hand she held. And she pulled Cordelia’s hand closer to her chest.

At the same time, she took a step forward.

<b>

“I was the one who was running away! I couldn’t face you! I couldn’t look at your face!! I wanted to talk like this again, just like before! I’m sorry! I’m so sorry, Cody!!”

<b>

With each word, the distance between them shrank.

Before they knew it, they were staring at each other so closely that their noses almost touched.

<b>

“...Karen! Karen!”

<b>

Hearing Karen speak about not being able to face each other and wanting to talk, Cordelia’s heart tightened.

Their foreheads gently touched, and they gazed into each other’s tear-filled eyes.

<b>

“I’m sorry, Cody! From now on, we’ll always be together!”

“Of course, of course, Karen! We’ll always be together!”

<b>

The two strongly held each other’s hands. And they gently, yet meaningfully, pressed their foreheads together.

<b>

Before they knew it, the tears they had been holding back overflowed, and at the same time, smiles burst forth as if they couldn’t hold back any longer.

As they shed tears, laughter spilled from both of their mouths.

The two shared a feeling as if the lump that had been deep within them was slowly melting away.

They found an unchanging connection in each other’s eyes.

<b>

Cordelia quietly took a breath and composed her smile that had spilled out.

Then, she deeply and gently grasped Karen’s hand once more.

Their faces were still close enough that their noses almost touched.

With that, Cordelia quietly closed her eyes and began to weave words as if reciting a solemn poem.

<b>

“As long as the sun and moon exist…”

<b>

Reacting to Cordelia’s words, Karen smiled happily and immediately closed her eyes, continuing in the same solemn tone after Cordelia.

<b>

“To my eternal friend, Cordelia Casper…”

“To Karen Merlin, I pledge my loyalty…”

<b>

As if calling out to each other’s words, they gently passed their thoughts to each other, weaving their words together.

<b>

“‘We solemnly swear’”

<b>

Finally, the two voiced their oath to each other in unison.

<b>

It was the same friendship oath they had exchanged in the garden of the Merlin family when they were young.

Using a passage from the story they had seen together as children, they pledged their friendship to each other.

With those feelings in their hearts, they once again exchanged their vows.

<b>

“I promise, Karen! I will never leave you alone again!”

“Yeah! Let’s always, always be together!”

“This time, I will protect you no matter what, just as I promised!”

“Protecting Cody is my role!”

<b>

The two laughed like children, rubbing their foreheads together.

Feeling the warmth of each other’s body in their clasped hands, they couldn’t help but feel overwhelming joy and laughed again.

<b>

“Cody… I love you!”

“I love you too… I love you, Karen!”

<b>

The small light at the observation deck gently illuminated the two filled with joy.

As if to make up for the lost time, something warm filled the hearts of Karen and Cordelia.

And they understood that they had regained the irreplaceable pieces they had lost within themselves.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The wind blew.

The small light set on the observation deck flickered weakly.

From the shadows of the trees where the light couldn’t reach, a chilling wind blew through.

Like a sticky piece of filth, a shadow moved slickly from within.

<b>

“Wonderful! Truly wonderful!”

<b>

Suddenly, it appeared, clapping its hands as it emerged from the shadows.

The shadow, taking on a human form, clapped with an overwhelmed expression as if applauding a performance.

<b>

“Wonderful! It was so moving, Karen!”

<b>

The wind carried clouds, covering the moon and blocking the stars.

<b>

“...Van Nibun? What are you doing here?!”

<b>

The figure that Karen Merlin called Van Nibun revealed itself before the girls, hiding its mocking eyes.
