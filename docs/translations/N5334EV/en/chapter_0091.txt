“…………What is this, what is going on?! What have you made me do?! What have you made me do?!! Answer me, Baldermonte!!”

“It is the extermination of the demon race. You have destroyed a clan of demons that posed a threat to the kingdom.”

“Don’t joke with me!! What do you mean ‘demon race’?! These people are just ‘humans’!! They were just living their ordinary lives! Men and women! Children and the elderly! They were just living normally!!”

“The demon race is evil in its very existence; their tainted presence is always a threat and an obstacle to the kingdom. No matter how small the opponent may be, it is necessary to eradicate them without mercy.”

“What threat?! Eradication?! Aren’t the opponents mostly women and children who have no fighting power?!! There’s no need to burn down such a small village!!!”

“With this, we have been able to destroy one of the demon race's strongholds. This is a significant victory.”

“Don’t you dare joke with me!! This… this is just mass murder! Killing villagers who can’t even resist!!”

“War is indeed a dreadful thing. We must eradicate all demons as soon as possible and create a world where my people are not trampled upon by them.”

“Y-You!!”

“Stop it, Suzu!! It’s useless to argue with him!”

“But, but Thor-kun! This is… this is wrong!! They said it would be for the sake of my father and the others… they said if we defeat the Demon King, we might be able to go home… But! That’s definitely a lie!!”

“Yeah, I know, I know. You can’t trust that council.”

“I don’t want this anymore! I want to go home… Let’s go home, Thor-kun! I want to go home!!”

“…………Suzu”

“……Dad, Mom, big brother.…… I miss you! Please take me back… Take me back to big brother!!”

“Suzu! It’s okay, we will definitely be able to go home someday! Until then, I’ll be here with you! I’ll always be here!!”

“Thor-kun… Thor-kun!!”

I had a dream for the first time in a while.

What memory is this from?

<b>

No, perhaps it’s not even my memory.

Thinking back, the memories from before I came here seem to be fading more and more with time.

Now, I can hardly remember the faces of the people who were around me, let alone my own face from back then.

Even the memories of daily life are vague.

<b>

Yet, the knowledge of this body and skills, as well as knowledge of games and modern times, remain clear, which is strange.

However, sometimes I vividly recall small episodes.

<b>

Honestly, I have no idea what has happened to my memories.

<b>

Normally, if I had such vague memories, I might feel uneasy about my own existence, but for some reason, I feel no concern about this matter.

<b>

So, whether the dream I just had was a memory of mine or something that came from elsewhere, I couldn’t really tell, and I felt quite indifferent about it.

<b>

Who was that brown-haired girl who was crying?

Who was the handsome man I was arguing with?

Who was the boy gently holding the girl?

I feel like I know them well, yet it also feels like I’m seeing them for the first time.

<b>

In the drowsiness of waking up, I was absentmindedly thinking about such things, but as my mind awakened, the memories of the dream melted away like waves crashing against a sandcastle.

<b>

<b>

I got out of bed to wake up my sleepy head, poured water from the pitcher into the basin, and washed my face with it. Then, after drying my face with the clean towel provided, I was fully awake.

I opened the curtains and flung open the window, letting the warm summer breeze flow into the room along with the morning sunlight.

<b>

<b>

Today is the 28th of the Red Moon, 3rd month.

Yesterday, we graduated from the village school.

As long as we had the necessary credits before graduation, there was no need to attend school anymore, and we could freely spend our time preparing for further education or helping the younger students, making the last part quite free.

Even the day before the long vacation, all the graduates came to school, received encouragement from Teacher Daisy, who said, “Do your best at Dekkenbel,” and then we went home as usual.

In this way, I successfully completed my basic education yesterday and was about to welcome my last summer in the village.

<b>

In the next month, I will be advancing to a boarding school at Dekkenbel.

Thinking about starting preparations for that departure makes me feel a bit heavy.

The thought of leaving Amukamu makes my mood sink more and more…….

But…… that’s why! I will enjoy this long summer vacation starting today…… I will have a blast with Vivi, Mia, and of course, Helena and Mary!

<b>

I sat at the dresser, carefully brushed my hair, then slipped into my favorite sky-blue dress and twirled in front of the mirror.

The hem of the skirt danced gracefully, creating a beautiful arc as it fell.

My hair swayed and flowed, shimmering in the light.

<b>

Now my hair has grown long enough to reach just above my shoulder blades.

I can’t style it in pigtails anymore, but I can enjoy various hairstyles.

However, most of the time, Sonia Mama happily braids it for me.

<b>

I’ve also grown 5 centimeters since then.

My limbs have become slender, and I think I’ve grown into a more feminine figure.

Of course, the important parts have also developed properly!!

<b>

But recently, I feel like I’m the one most affected by the lucky pervert incidents caused by the Haggard brothers, Arvin and Ryder, which I find a bit unacceptable.

I thought this kind of flirtatious role was Mia’s job! Is it not?! 

<b>

Moreover, sometimes I find myself on the receiving end of their antics, and it’s a bit annoying when Karl, with his wide eyes, looks at me excitedly and seems to want more.

……Well, I get it, I really do. It’s just how adolescent boys are!

But still! I think it would be better if they blushed a bit like Lombard and looked away to raise their likability a little, right?!

Karl’s staring and his subsequent soul-crushing cries for more are just too much already?!

Next time, I’ll have Carla scold them thoroughly!

<b>

However, I also find myself understanding that this is just how boys are.

Having memories of being a boy, I can relate to these feelings…….

But if I don’t consciously think about it, I don’t even remember that I used to be like that, and I realize how much I’ve fully adapted to this body now.

<b>

Well? Just because I understand how boys feel doesn’t mean I’ll forgive them; that’s a separate issue!!

<b>

<b>

Now, the first day of my last summer vacation is about to begin.

Today, Papa Howard said he would have guests over.

I need to finish getting ready quickly and prepare to welcome the guests.

It looks like it will be another hot day.

Thank you for reading!

<b>

I wanted to start Chapter 3 before the holiday, but it hasn’t been progressing as I hoped, and the updates are delayed (>_<)

For now, I will be posting three chapters consecutively.

<b>

<b>

The world is in a difficult situation, but I hope you can enjoy this chaotic writing even a little bit <(_ _)>
