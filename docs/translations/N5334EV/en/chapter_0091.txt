I'm going to go to ............ and I'm going to say, "What is this all about? What did you make me do? What did you make me do? Answer me, Valdemonte!

You have defeated the demon tribe. You have destroyed the demon tribe that has avenged the kingdom.

Don't be silly! What are you talking about, 'demons'? These people are just 'people'! They were just living a normal life! Men and women! Children and old people! They just lived normal lives!

The demons are evil in their very existence, and their unclean presence is a constant threat and obstacle to the kingdom. They must be destroyed without mercy, no matter how small the opponent.

What's the threat? They're all women and children who don't have the strength to fight! Aren't they just women and children who don't have the strength to fight? There is no need to burn this little village!

We have now destroyed one stronghold of the demon tribe. This is a great victory.

'F**k you! This ...... is nothing but a mass murder! This is nothing but mass murder, killing helpless villagers!

War is a fearful thing. We must destroy all the demons as soon as possible and create a world where my people will not be overrun by them.

Ko! You!

Don't! Tin! You can't talk to him!

But, but, Thor! This is not like this, this is not like this! Because it's for your father-in-law and the others, ...... and because you said you might be able to go home if you defeat the Demon King, ....... But! That's an absolute lie!

"Yes, I know, I know. Don't trust that senate.

I can't take it anymore! I don't want to! I want to go home...... Let's go home, Thor! I want to go home! I wanna go home!

"............ tin"

"...... dad, mom, and big brother. I want to ...... see you! Let me go home,...... and let me go back to my brother's place!"

Tin! Don't worry, you'll be able to come home someday! I'll be here until then! I'll always be here!

Thor-kun ...... Thor-kun!"

I had a dream for the first time in a long time.

What time is this a memory?

<blank>

No, maybe it is not my memory.

Thinking back, my memories of the time before I came here seem to be getting more hazy with each passing moment.

Now I can hardly remember my face, let alone the people who were around me.

Even the memory of what happened on a daily basis is vague.

<blank>

And yet, the kono body and skills. It's funny because the game and modern knowledge remains clean.

But sometimes I vividly recall small episodes.

<blank>

I honestly have no idea what is going on with my memory.

<blank>

Normally, if I had vague memories like this, I might even feel uneasy about my own existence, but for some reason, I do not feel any concern about this.

<blank>

Therefore, I am not sure if the dream I just had was a memory I had or something that came from somewhere else, and I felt objectively that it was relatively unimportant.

<blank>

Who was that crying brown-haired girl?

What about the beautiful boy who was arguing with you?

What about the boy who was gently holding the girl?

I feel like I know them well, and I feel like I'm seeing them for the first time.

<blank>

In the slumber of waking up from sleep, I thought about this in a daze, but as my head awoke, the memory of the dream melted and drifted away, like a castle made of sand being crumbled by a wave of water.

<blank>

<blank>

I get out of bed to wake up my head from sleep, pour water from the pitcher into the washbasin, and wash my face with it. Then, I wipe the water off my face with a clean towel provided, and I am already wide awake.

The curtains are open, the windows are flung open, and a warm summer breeze spills into the room along with the morning sun.

Today is the 28th day of the red month of 3.

Yesterday we graduated from the village school.

The last one was quite free, as long as the required credits were earned, there was no need to go to school any further until graduation, and students were free to spend their time preparing for higher education or to come to school to take care of their underclassmen.

Yesterday, which was also the day before the long vacation, all the graduates went to school and received a pep talk from Ms. Daisy, who said, 'Good luck at Dekenbel,' and then left the school normally and that was it.

And so, yesterday, I successfully completed my basic education, and I am now entering my last summer in the village.

<blank>

The month after next, he will also be going to boarding school in De Kembel.

I am a little daunted by the thought that I have to start preparing for its departure as well.

The thought of leaving Amcam makes me feel like I'm going to be depressed with a bang. ......

But ......, that's why! I'm going to ...... for a long summer break starting today, and I'm going to enjoy this last summer to the fullest, not only with Bibi and Mia, but also with Helena and Mary!

<blank>

I sit down at the dresser, brush my hair carefully, slip on my favorite sky-blue dress, and spin around in front of my dresser.

The hem of the fluttery skirt descends in a beautiful arc like a dance.

The hair, too, swayed and flowed, seeding the light.

<blank>

By now her hair had grown to just above her shoulder blades on her back.

I can no longer wear my hair in a picktail, but I can now enjoy a variety of hairstyles.

Most of the time, though, Sonia-mama enjoys braiding them for me.

<blank>

My height has also grown five centimeters since then.

Her arms and legs have become slimmer and more feminine.

Naturally, the important parts are also growing well!

<blank>

But lately, I'm not quite convinced that I feel like I've met more victims of the lucky schemes invoked by the Haggard brothers, Irving and Ryder, than anyone else.

I thought it was Mia's job to be in charge of this kind of sexiness! I wonder if it's not? I wonder if it is?

<blank>

And sometimes, when I would be accompanied by Carl, he would peel his eyes off and look at me happily. One of the things that pisses me off a little bit is when Carl comes over to my place and looks at me with his eyes peeled back in a happy manner.

......Well, I understand, though, that's what happens to adolescent boys!

But you know what? I think a little cheek tinting and averted gazes like Lombardt would make him a little more likable, don't you think?

I think Carl's gurning and that soulful cry for a refill immediately afterwards is a good bit too much, don't you?

I'll have Carla put it all together next time and scold me with a tap!

<blank>

However, there is also a part of me that understands that boys are like this.

As someone who remembers being a man, I know how this feels. ......

However, I am reminded once again that I am so familiar with it now that I would not even remember that I used to be like that if I did not pay attention to it in this way.

<blank>

Well? Just because I know how such boys feel, whether I forgive them or not is another matter!

<blank>

<blank>

Now it's time to start the first day of the last summer vacation.

He said that Howard Papa's guests would be coming today.

We must get ready quickly and be ready to greet our guests.

It will be another hot day.

Thank you for reading!

I had hoped to start the third chapter before the holidays, but things haven't been going as smoothly as I had hoped, and I'm behind on updates (>_<).

For now, we will drop only three episodes in a row.

<blank>

<blank>

The world is in a terrible state of affairs, and I hope you enjoy my ramblings a little <(_ _)>.
