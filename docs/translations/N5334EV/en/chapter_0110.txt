# Chapter 98: Corridor Front

"How about you start acting with a bit of decorum?"

"Huh?! What are you talking about? We just want to walk down the corridor!"

"I'm speaking of your awareness as a lady, you know? Do you not understand?"

"I still don't get it?! Does awareness even matter?!"

"That's why I'm saying that spreading out in the middle of the corridor is not visually pleasing, you see? We simply want to enter the classroom..."

"Oh? Go ahead and enter, if you like! Look, right here! You can pass through from the side!"

"Ugh, you really lack comprehension, don't you? If I were to yield the way, it would mean that I am conceding. That wouldn't be beneficial for you, would it?"

"Huh?! What are you saying?! Just step aside! Enough with the yielding already! Clear the way!!"

"That's why I'm saying this for your sake. It is only reasonable that those in a lower position yield the way, isn't it?"

"Wha?! Are you telling us to step aside?! Are we beneath you?!!"

"I have been asking you to act with decorum since earlier."

"Are you talking about the now non-existent aristocracy?! It's ridiculous to cling to a fossil like that!"

"If you do not know common sense, the one who will be embarrassed is you, you know?"

"What does a poor noble have to be so arrogant about!"

"...Are you not afraid of being scorned for being so base-born?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

This is serious! This is really a serious fight!! Scary~~, scary, the fight between women is scary~~.

Wow, I really don't want to get involved in that. I totally understand why everyone is watching from a distance. There's no way I'd want to get caught up in that! I definitely don't want to! No way!!

<b>

<b>

"I'm saying that one should have the necessary common sense in their actions within the academy. It seems that your behavior has been quite reckless, and your words and actions are undoubtedly outside of that."

"...But that has nothing to do with you, does it?!"

"I'm saying that we are not the only ones watching!"

"Tch!!"

<b>

Wow, did that girl just click her tongue?!

RuuRii Diet is not only tough in appearance but also in personality. Her face looks like it's about to crack with tension!

Is Lady Cordelia okay? She's picking a fight with someone like that?

Well, Lady Cordelia seems to have a pretty strong personality too. I guess someone like her wouldn't think twice about going head-to-head with a girl like that.

I want to keep my distance!

<b>

"...Hey, is that Amukamu's..."

"Oh, the largest faction's..."

"Wow, they're boldly walking in this atmosphere..."

"Whoa! The three strong ones are all here."

<b>

Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on! What is that?! Who are they?! Who do they think they are, saying whatever they want?!!

Don't mention the largest faction!

Besides! I can't stand this atmosphere! They aren't acting boldly! They aren't just walking in here!!

And don't try to drag me into this! Don't group us together!!

Look! Those two just glared at us!!

<b>

<b>

Ugh! Both of them fell silent and are sending glances our way! I really want them to stop that.

Lady RuuRii looks at me like I'm some suspicious thing.

And Lady Cordelia... huh? Is she looking at me with some kind of expectation?

And this isn't just from the two of them; I'm feeling probing gazes from everyone around us, like "What will she do?"! I really want this to stop?!!

What do they want me to do?!

Aaaaaaaaaah, enough already!!

<b>

"...Is something the matter, everyone?"

<b>

I asked with a smile, completely ignoring the atmosphere!!

Whatever happens, happens!!

<b>

"...Good day to you, Lord Cloud."

<b>

Oh, Lady Cordelia turned to me and greeted me with a lovely smile.

The tense atmosphere she had been exuding until now vanished in an instant!

<b>

"Good day to you, Lady Caspar."

<b>

I also returned her greeting with my best smile.

<b>

"Well! You remembered my name?! Lord Cloud!"

"Of course, Lady Caspar. So... is something the matter?"

"No, it's nothing that would concern Lord Cloud. It's just a trivial matter."

"Is that so? I was worried because the corridor leading to the classroom was blocked, so I thought something might have happened."

"Well! If that's the case, Lord Cloud, please feel free to pass through here."

<b>

Saying that, Lady Cordelia and her two attendants stepped back to clear the way.

<b>

What is this...?

<b>

I was taken aback by how smoothly the conversation between the young ladies was flowing.

What on earth is this high-society demeanor of mine?

I wonder if this facade I put on will peel off at some point? Internally, I'm sweating bullets...

<b>

For now, it seems the facade hasn't peeled off yet.

Well, it was Bibi and Anna Marie who taught me these things rigorously, but if it were that easy to peel off, I wouldn't be able to face them.

And if it were to peel off, just imagining the looks on their faces afterward makes it too scary to even think about!

<b>

Despite my internal conflict, I was prepared to join the fray... but Lady Cordelia seemed to be responding to me more favorably than I expected?

<b>

"Hey! What is the meaning of this?! You didn't yield to us at all! Why are you yielding so easily to her?!!"

"I have been teaching you about 'reason' since earlier. This is what I mean."

"I don't understand what you're saying!!"

<b>

Lady RuuRii is throwing more fuel onto the fire with her aggressive attitude!

And that fuel is me!! No way!!

Lady RuuRii is really furious!

I totally understand why she feels that way since my treatment is a complete 180 from how she treated herself! I can't blame her feelings!

But that doesn't mean I want her to glare at me like that!!

<b>

What is wrong with her?! While thinking that, Lady RuuRii glared at me fiercely, and one of her followers seemed to whisper something in her ear.

<b>

"Huh? Amukamu? ...The largest faction?"

"...Cloud? Is this her?"

<b>

Lady RuuRii was whispering to her follower while looking at me, muttering something to confirm.

So, I'd appreciate it if you could stop looking at me with such suspicious eyes.

I am indeed Cloud from Amukamu, but I'm not part of the largest faction or anything!

<b>

By the way, this girl looks a bit flashy, doesn't she...? Is she wearing light makeup? Her collar is a bit loose, isn't it? And isn't her skirt a bit short?!

I can see why Lady Cordelia would say something to her. She's a bit edgy for a student of this school...

But if the dorm supervisor saw her, she'd definitely be in trouble, right? Maybe she does this after leaving the dorm?

If that's the case, maybe she's working hard in secret, but still...?

<b>

Well, how should I put it, is this girl a bit of a "gal"? I don't even know if there are "gals" in this world!

<b>

"...Karen?"

"!!"

<b>

Lady RuuRii, who had been glaring at me, spotted Karen behind me and exclaimed in surprise.

Karen also flinched at the sound of her voice.

Huh? It seems like Lady RuuRii and Karen know each other.

<b>

"Hey! Why are you hiding there?! Huh?!!"

"......"

<b>

Huh?

<b>

"I'm asking why you're hiding there?!"

"!...……"

<b>

Huh?

<b>

"Hey! You can hear me, right?! Answer me, Karen!!"

<b>

Hey, hey...

<b>

For some reason, this girl is intimidating our Karen.

At this point, I can't just overlook this.

<b>

I quickly stepped between Karen and Lady RuuRii, hiding Karen from her view.

Lady RuuRii looked at me in surprise, but I made sure to keep my smile intact and quietly stared back at Lady RuuRii.

<b>

"W-What do you want?"

<b>

As I was about to step toward Karen, I moved, causing Lady RuuRii to lose her momentum and stumble.

Lady RuuRii glared at me, but fortunately, she didn't try to step forward any further.

<b>

Now, if she would just back down, that would be great, but I guess that's not going to happen... She's still glaring at me.

I don't want things to escalate too much... what should I do?

<b>

"Hey, Karen! Do you think you can just hide like this and not face any consequences?!!"

<b>

Oh? What is this girl doing?

Even at this point, she's still trying to intimidate Karen? How rude...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Excuse me, Lady Suzy, is there something going on here?"

<b>

At that moment, someone suddenly spoke from behind.

It was Bibi, also known as Beatrice.

Then, she stood beside me with a composed expression, as if to say, "Sorry to keep you waiting."

Mia also came along and stood on my right side.

<b>

I had sensed that the two of them were nearby, but I wish they had come out a bit earlier!

Why did they choose such a perfectly timed moment to show up? Ugh!

<b>

But now, Lady RuuRii won't be able to see Karen anymore. This is a solid Amukamu guard!

<b>

Still, being called "Lady Suzy" by Bibi is so ticklish!

This quick switch to a formal demeanor is impressive.

<b>

I had been instructed by Colin beforehand that "it's fine to speak casually among family, but when in front of other students, you should use proper language." 

So, Bibi and Mia generally refer to me with "Lady" outside of places where only family is present. It's quite amusing!

Conversely, I call my seniors Colin and Dana with "Lady" as well.

It's still okay to call Colin "Lady," but calling Dana or Carla "Lady" feels incredibly awkward.

Hearing Arvin, who was nearby, burst out laughing at that moment, I couldn't blame him. He ended up getting beaten up by Dana and Carla afterward!

<b>

With the two of them standing beside me, Lady RuuRii, who had been bristling, seemed to have been somewhat intimidated and fell silent.

The follower next to her whispered something to her.

<b>

"This is bad, RuuRii, that one is the top student."

"They said the other big one has the highest magical power in the grade."

"...Tch."

<b>

Wow, she clicked her tongue again! I told her to stop doing that in public; she's a girl!

And it seems that her followers knew about Bibi and Mia. They must be quite well-informed!

By the way, what does "big" refer to? I kind of want to ask!

<b>

"Fine, I don't particularly want to pass through there anyway! ...I'm going back to the classroom!"

<b>

Saying that, she turned her back and walked away with her two followers.

Now that I think about it, their classroom is also further down this corridor, but were they headed somewhere else? Well, it doesn't matter now.

...But the sharp glare she shot at Karen as she left was unacceptable. Yeah, that was unacceptable.

The surrounding students, who had been silent until then, began to murmur among themselves.

I feel like they're talking about me, but I think it's best to ignore it! Yeah, just ignore it!

<b>

Right now, I'm more worried about Karen's mental state. She must have been quite shaken.

<b>

"Lady Karen... are you alright?"

"…Ah, I'm sorry for causing you concern."

<b>

Since there are other students around, both of us are using formal language.

<b>

I reached out to Karen, asking if she was okay, but she averted her gaze and hasn't looked at me since earlier.

For some reason, she avoided my outstretched hand.

Just as I was about to say something more, a voice suddenly came from the side.

<b>

"Karen Merlin! How long are you going to be dazed?! Hurry and get into the classroom!"

"Y-Yes, Lady Caspar."

"Lady Karen, I'll see you after school. I'll be waiting for you."

"Y-Yes, Lady Suzy. ...Excuse me."

<b>

At Lady Cordelia's words, Karen started moving, bowing to us as she entered the classroom.

As I watched Karen enter the classroom, I suddenly felt a gaze directed at me.

When I turned to look, I saw Lady Cordelia staring at me, standing upright.

She then bowed her head toward me.

<b>

"Thank you for protecting our classmate."

"No, Lady Karen is my roommate. It's only natural."

"Even so, thank you, Lord Cloud."

<b>

After saying that, she bowed her head elegantly once more and then entered her classroom.

<b>

In this short time this morning, my impression of Lady Cordelia has changed quite a bit. When I first met her, I thought she was strong-willed and proud, but perhaps she's just honest and a bit clumsy...

I'm concerned about Karen, but I feel that Lady Cordelia won't treat her badly.

I hope she can calm down a bit before we meet after school...

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Seriously! I was worried about what would happen!!"

<b>

As soon as we entered the classroom, Bibi exclaimed with wide eyes.

Huh? Did I get scolded? Wait, did I not handle things well? Everything ended without any issues, right?

Was it really something to be scolded about?

<b>

"Huh? Did I manage to act like a lady? Right?!"

"That's not it!! You can't let that kind of intense killing intent leak out, even as a joke!!"

<b>

Huh? Killing intent? Isn't that about acting like a lady?

What even is killing intent? There's no way I would let something like that out!

<b>

"...That face, it's the face of someone who is unaware?!"

"I'm not unaware; I didn't let anything out!"

"Hah... well, it was just a slight leak, but still!"

"That's right, it felt like 'Oh, I unlocked the door,' you know?"

<b>

Mia even nodded along, affirming what Bibi said.

Eh? Is that so? Did something leak out?

It's true that I was a bit annoyed, but... did it really come out?

<b>

"Well! If it was at that level, normal kids wouldn't notice! But! If someone is sensitive, they might catch on!"

"Suzy's intimidation is no joke."

<b>

In a duel, overcoming that is the first step! Arvin, who was listening nearby, chimed in.

Eh? I didn't set such a high hurdle in a duel!

<b>

"No! But this isn't a duel, so I wouldn't intimidate anyone, right?"

"If you genuinely intimidate someone, it won't end well! That's why I'm telling you to be careful!"

"That's right, what Bibi said is true! If Suzy normally intimidates someone, they could easily have a heart attack!"

<b>

Wow! How rude!

Arvin just said something incredibly rude!!

There's no way it would go that far, right?! Right?!!

<b>

...Huh? Wait? Why is everyone looking at me like that?

Not just Arvin and Bibi, but why are Mia and Ronbart also smiling faintly and looking off into the distance?

Huh? Why? Huh? ...Is that so? Is that really the case?

<b>

"Anyway! You were about to leak intimidation, so I was in a panic!"

<b>

Bibi said that she had been observing me from the shadows, waiting to see how I would handle things as a lady.

She said she was watching to see if I had grown enough to handle things on my own.

But when she sensed that things were getting serious, she rushed over to my side.

<b>

"Sure, I told you to smile, but I never expected you to smile while exuding such intense killing intent!"

"I-I wasn't exuding anything?! But... um, I'm sorry for the trouble?"

"Honestly... you didn't need to deal with such small fry properly! To be honest, I wanted to say, 'You're just a pathetic little thing, aren't you?!'"

"Y-Stop! That's a bad idea! It would definitely lead to war!! Please don't say that!!"

"That's why I didn't say it!"

<b>

Ugh, I can easily imagine Bibi picking a fight and having a verbal battle with Lady RuuRii...

<b>

"Well! Those little ones are not only foolish but also seem quite dull, so they probably didn't notice your leaking intimidation at all!"

"Still, I think some people caught on. There were a few who changed their expressions around us."

"Well, that's true! Since they're in this school, it would be strange if there weren't any!"

<b>

In response to Mia's words, Bibi nodded thoughtfully before answering.

<b>

"Anyway! You should wear whatever you can while you can! It's only a matter of time anyway!"

<b>

Bibi is saying something harsh.

I thought, "Is it really that bad?" and looked around, finding that Mia, Arvin, and Ronbart were all nodding in agreement.

Everyone is being so harsh! Sob, sob...

<b>

Well, I do realize that I can't keep pretending to be someone I'm not forever! Hmph!

<b>

More importantly, I'm worried about Karen.

I'm concerned about Lady RuuRii's attitude towards Karen.

...I think I should do a bit of research on the Nivun family's second son, including about Gruusmil.

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What should we do?! Was she angry? She looked angry, right?!"

"Calm down, Lady Cordelia! It's okay, she wasn't directing her anger at you!"

"But, but! I did something so pushy..."

"It's fine! She probably doesn't care about that! ...Probably."

"Ah! Really?! Really?!"

<b>

Since entering the classroom, Lucille has been trying to calm down the agitated Cordelia.

The clash with the girls from Group 2 in the corridor had led to Lady Cloud from Group 1 taking the brunt of it, and the anger she had emitted had left Cordelia feeling like they had been reminded of their sheltered upbringing.

It's no wonder that Cordelia is losing her composure.

<b>

Did the girls from Group 2, RuuRii Diet and her friends, not feel that wave of anger at all?

Or do they have such a high tolerance that that level of anger doesn't even register?

...No, that can't be the case.

Looking at Cordelia, who is desperately trying to suppress her agitation, Lucille shakes her head while glancing at her cousin beside her, who is also in a state of distress.

It’s hard to believe that they could feel nothing, especially after being so close to it.

They must be incredibly dull... there's no doubt about it! Lucille Moore concluded.

<b>

Looking at her cousin, Catherine Moore, standing next to her, it was clear that they were indeed the epitome of dullness.

<b>

Catherine was desperately trying to maintain her usual cool expression while tears welled up in her eyes, her whole body trembling slightly.

How shaken can she be! Lucille felt the urge to point that out, but... it can't be helped.

Despite her demeanor, Catherine has a surprisingly sharp sensitivity. Lucille has always thought that she possesses a sharper sense than anyone else in this class.

To see her in such a state...

<b>

"Are you okay, Catherine? Should I accompany you to the infirmary?"

"I-I-I-I-I'm fine, Lucille."

"Oh, you don't need to talk. You don't have to force yourself to speak."

<b>

Catherine tightly pressed her lips together and nodded slightly.

It's understandable that they would be shaken after being so close to that anger, Lucille thought.

In fact, she herself had been momentarily paralyzed by that intensity.

<b>

It seems that a few others also sensed that presence, but it was clear from looking at the girls from Group 2 that not everyone did.

Whether it's a good thing or a bad thing to be able to sense such things, Lucille couldn't say.

But she felt as if she was being told, "If you can't even sense this, you don't deserve to stand before me."

Thinking that this might be a glimpse of the power of the Amukamu princess made her break out in a light sweat.

<b>

And there was one more person on her mind... the girl who had been at the center of that incident.

She had been restless the whole time, but at least now she seemed relatively calm.

<b>

"She must not be at peace either..."

"……"

<b>

In response to Lucille's mutter, Cordelia furrowed her brows and sent a pained glance toward her.

And Lucille Moore quietly gazed at Cordelia's profile as she looked at Karen Merlin, trying to gauge her inner feelings.
