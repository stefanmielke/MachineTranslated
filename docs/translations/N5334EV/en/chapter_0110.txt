# 98 The Corridor Front

How about a little moderation in your behavior?

What are you talking about? What are you talking about? We just want to go down the hallway.

"We are talking about being a lady, you know? Don't you understand?"

I don't understand what you mean by "more and more"? Doesn't it matter if I'm aware of it or not?

The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're looking for. We just want to get into the classroom, anyway. ......

Oh?" Come on in, you can come in, okay? Here, here! Why don't you come through the side here?"

I am sure you have a very limited comprehension of what I am talking about. I've given way to you. How can that be good for you?"

What? What are you talking about? Why don't you just back away? Give way! Get out of the way!

I am saying this for your sake. It is only logical to give way to those who are lower on the ladder, isn't it?"

What? Are you telling us to retreat? You think we're lower than you?

I've already told you to mind your manners.

You're talking about an aristocracy that doesn't exist anymore? It's ridiculous that you're clinging to a fossil!"

If you don't know decency, you will be the one to be humiliated?"

What a bunch of poor aristocrats you are!"

"Are you willing to be slandered as shallow, etc., as ...... upstarts are?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It's a real fight! It's a real fight! I'm scared~~, I'm scared, I'm scared of women's fights~~.

Wow, I don't want to go in there. I can see why everyone is looking at me from a distance. I definitely don't want to go in there and get involved! I don't either! Absolutely not!

<blank>

<blank>

I am saying that you should have the necessary decency in your behavior in the school. Your behavior is definitely out of line.

"Just because it's ...... doesn't mean it's any of Soc.'s business!"

I'm telling you we're not the only ones watching!"

Tsk!"

<blank>

Wow, this girl got tongue-tied, didn't she?

This girl Ruly Deet looks like she has a hard personality as well as looks. I can almost hear her face twitching, can't you?

Miss Cordelia, are you all right? Selling a fight to a girl like that?

Well, Miss Cordelia seems to be quite feisty, too. I don't think I'd want to be stiff with a girl like that unless she was someone like that.

I would like to refrain from doing so to the best of my ability!

<blank>

"...... Hey, that thing is the ...... of AMCAM."

Ah, ............ of the largest faction."

'Awesome, I'm going in with a bang in the air here ......'

"Wow! Three in a Row!"

<blank>

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is that? Who is it? Who is it? Who are you to say what you want?

Don't say the largest faction!

Roughly! I don't endure this kind of air? I didn't go in there! I didn't go in there!

Don't try to drag me into this! Don't align with me!

Look at the two of them staring at us!

<blank>

<blank>

They were both silent and glanced at me! Please stop that kind of thing.

Miss Lurie was like looking at a stinker. She looks like she is looking at a stinky thing.

So, Miss Cordelia is ...... hmm? Are these the eyes you're expecting to see?

And this is not only from the two of them, but from everyone around me, who are looking at me like "How do you want to play this? I'm getting probing looks from not only the two of them, but also from everyone around me, asking me how to move! I want you to stop this too!

What do you want me to do?

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

<blank>

"...... how can I help you all?"

<blank>

I smiled and listened with a body that didn't even read the air!

I don't care what you do!

<blank>

"...... this is, Good day, Mr. Cloud."

<blank>

Miss Cordelia turned her body to me and greeted me in the morning with a nice smile.

The swarthy atmosphere he had been exuding up to this point was a breath of fresh air!

<blank>

Good day, Mr. Casper.

<blank>

Not to be outdone, I try to return the greeting with a ready-made smile.

<blank>

Oh, my! You remember my name? Mr. Cloud!

Of course, Mr. Casper. So, ......, how can I help you?"

No, it's nothing to be concerned about, Mr. Cloud. It's just a trivial matter.

I was worried that something had happened to me. The corridor leading to the classrooms was filled with people, and I was worried that something had happened to them.

Well! In that case, Mr. Cloud, please come through here."

<blank>

With that, Miss Cordilia and her two attendants stepped back to clear the way.

<blank>

What the heck is that? .......

<blank>

I can't help but be amazed at how fluent the young ladies are in conversation with each other.

How am I behaving like a totally sophisticated young lady?

I wondered if the skin I had put on on the spur of the moment would ever come off. I'm actually sweating profusely on the inside. ......

<blank>

At any rate, the skin doesn't seem to have peeled off yet.

Well, Bibi and AnnaMarie were the ones who strictly trained me in this area, but if I peeled off that easily, I wouldn't be able to face them.

I mean, I'm afraid to imagine the faces of the two of them afterwards if it comes off, but I'm too scared to easily peel it off!

<blank>

With such conflicts in mind, I was prepared to participate in the event. ......, but Miss Cordelia responded more favorably to me than I thought she would.

<blank>

Hey, what's going on? What do you mean? You didn't give it to us at all! Why did you give it to him so easily?

I have been teaching you the word 'reason' for a while now. I have been telling you about 'reason' for a while now, and what I mean by that is this.

I don't know what you're talking about!

<blank>

This guy is throwing more fuel on Miss Lurie who came to bite him!

And that fuel is me! Yeeeeeaaaahhh!

Miss Lurie, you're all cut up!

Of course, his attitude toward me is 180 degrees opposite to the way he has treated himself up to now! I don't know how you feel, though!

But I don't want you to stare at me like that!

<blank>

What is this guy? One of her cronies seemed to mutter a few words or two into Miss Ruly's ear as she glared at me, as if to say, "What the hell is this guy?

<blank>

What's the word? Amcam? ...... largest faction?"

I'm thinking, "...... cloud? This guy?"

<blank>

Miss Lurie was listening to her cronies, looking at me and mumbling back and forth as if to confirm something.

So, please don't look at people with that kind of stern look in your eyes if you can help it.

I am certainly a cloud of Amcam, but I am not the largest faction or anything!

<blank>

But still, is this girl a bit gaudy when you look at her closely? It's ....... Is she wearing light makeup? Is her collar a little loose too? Is her skirt a little short too?

Surely, I can't help but wonder what Miss Cordelia would have to say about that? She's a bit sharp for a kid from this school. ......

But if the dorm supervisor finds out I'm doing this, I'm sure I'm out, right? Do they do this after they leave the dorm?

If so, I can't help but wonder if they're doing a good job of hiding, but I'm not sure... but ...... hey?

<blank>

Well, what can I say, this girl is kind of gal-ish? I don't know if there is such a thing as a "gal" in this world! I don't know if there is such a thing as a "gyaru" in this world!

<blank>

"...... Karen?"

!!!"

<blank>

Miss Lurie, who had been staring at me, spotted Karen behind me and shouted in surprise.

Karen also heard the voice and felt a small jump in her body.

Hm? I knew that this Miss Lurie and Karen seem to know each other.

<blank>

"Hey! Why are you in there? Hey!

"......"

<blank>

Hmm?

<blank>

Why are you hiding in there?

"! ......"

<blank>

Hmm?

<blank>

Hey! I know you can hear me! Answer me! Karen!

<blank>

Hey woi. .......

<blank>

For some reason, this girl is trying to intimidate my Karen.

I can't just overlook it.

<blank>

I quickly inserted myself between Karen and Miss Lurie, hiding Karen from her eyes.

Miss Lurie looks at me surprised, but I try not to lose my smile and look at her quietly.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

I moved just as she was about to step out to face Karen, and Miss Lurie was caught off guard and looked like she was playing a trick.

Miss Lurie glared at me, but fortunately, she did not try to move forward any further.

<blank>

Now, I'd be happy if it would just pull back, but I guess that's not going to happen. ...... I'm still staring at Koch.

I don't want to make things too much worse, but ......, I don't know what's going on.

<blank>

I'll tell you what, Karen! You think you can get away with this sneaking around for free?

<blank>

"Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh? What's this guy?

At this stage of the game, are you still trying to intimidate Karen even more? You are a liar. ............

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

This is Mr. Suzy, what's going on here?"

<blank>

And then, suddenly, someone called out to me from behind.

This is Beatrice, aka Bibi.

Then, he comes to stand by my left side with a composed look on his face, as if to say, "Sorry to keep you waiting.

Mia came with me and stood to my right.

<blank>

I knew the two of them had been watching me nearby earlier because I had a feeling they were there, but if they were going to come out, they should have come a little sooner!

Why do they come out at such a targeted time? Already!

<blank>

But now Miss Lurie will no longer see Karen. That's an ironclad amcam guard development!

<blank>

Still, I was still tickled when Bibi called me "Suzy-sama!

I think this switch to external development is quintessential.

<blank>

Colin had instructed me in advance that it was fine to talk with other students in private, but I had to use proper language when other students were watching.

Therefore, both Bibi and Mia call me by "sir" when we are not in the classroom, lounge, or other places where only their relatives are present. This really tickles me!

On the other hand, when I call Colin and Dana, who are my seniors, I call them with a "sama" (like "sir").

<blank>

It's still fine to add "Sama" to Colin, but when it comes to Dana and Kara, it's a very uncomfortable feeling to add "Sama" to their work.

I couldn't blame Irving for this one time, as he was listening to it from the side and gushing unbearably. Afterwards, though, Dana and Carla taco-knocked him over the head!

<blank>

<blank>

The two of them stood on either side of me, and even Miss Lurie, who was breathing hard, was somewhat intimidated and kept her mouth shut.

The crony kid next to me is overhearing something there.

<blank>

"Oh, no, Lurie, he's the head of the class."

The other big one said he had the most magic power in his grade.

"...... tch."

<blank>

Ugh, I got a big tongue lashing again, this girl! I told her to stop that kind of thing in public, she's a girl!

So, it seems that the kids around me knew about Bibi and Mia. Are they pretty well-informed?

But what do you mean by "big"? I'd like to ask him!

<blank>

'Fine, I don't really want to force my way through there! I'm going back to ...... classroom!"

<blank>

With that, he turned around and walked away with his two cronies.

Come to think of it, their classroom is just down the road, too, and I wonder where they were headed? Well, it doesn't really matter now.

I don't like the way he glanced sharply at Karen as he was leaving, even if it was ....... Yeah, that was not good.

The room had been quiet and still, and a murmur began to spread from the students who had been watching from the sidelines around them.

I feel like they are talking about me, but I think I'm losing if I pay attention to them, so I'll just let them pass! I'll just let it pass!

<blank>

I'm more worried about Karen's mental health than about that right now. Karen must have been very upset.

<blank>

Dear Karen ......, is everything alright?"

"......, ha, yes, I'm sorry for your concern."

<blank>

They are both using their own language now because of the eyes of the other students.

<blank>

I reached out to her and asked her if she was okay, but she kept her eyes down and wouldn't look at me.

I reached out my hand, but for some reason, he avoided my hand.

I was about to say a few more words when a voice came flying in from the side.

<blank>

Karen Marlin! How long are you going to stand there like a fool? Get in the classroom!

"Co, ......, yes, Mr. Casper."

Dear Karen, see you after school. I will be waiting for you."

I'm sorry. Please excuse us at ......."

<blank>

At Miss Cordelia's words, Karen moved, bowed to us, and went straight into the classroom.

As I followed Karen into the classroom with my eyes, I suddenly felt a gaze directed toward me.

I looked in that direction and saw Miss Cordilia standing there, staring at me, her posture straightened.

She bowed her head toward me.

<blank>

Thank you for defending our classmates.

No, Miss Cullen is my roommate, too. It's only natural."

Still, thank you very much, Mr. Cloud."

<blank>

With that, she bowed her head in a beautiful posture again and went into their classroom as well.

<blank>

In this short time this morning, my impression of Miss Cordelia has changed a lot. When I first met her, I thought she was a strong-willed, prideful girl, but this girl is honest and maybe just clumsy. ......

I am concerned about Karen, but I have a feeling that Miss Cordilia would not make it look bad.

I hope things have calmed down a bit by the time I see you after school. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I thought, "Oh my God! I was afraid of what was going to happen!

<blank>

As soon as I entered the classroom, Bibi peeled her eyes and came to me like that.

Huh? Did he scold you? Huh? Didn't I behave pretty well? Everything ended without incident, right?

Was it worth being scolded with such vigor?

<blank>

What? What? I was doing it like a lady, wasn't I? Right?

'That's not what I meant! There's no way you could have leaked that thick kill, even in jest!"

<blank>

Huh? What do you mean by "kill"? Don't you mean "ladylike stand-up"?

What do you mean, "deadly"? There's no way they would release such a thing!

<blank>

"......, that's the face of unawareness, isn't it?"

I didn't even put it out there!"

Hah ......, well it was only a slight ooze, but hey!"

'Yeah, how do you say, like, "Oh, I know I've unlocked the door?"'

<blank>

Even Mia nodded her head and affirmed what Bibi said.

Oh, yeah? Really? Did something ooze out of you?

Sure, I was a little peeved, but did you see ............?

<blank>

Well! If it was that big, normal kids wouldn't even notice! But! I'm sure a sensitive person would be able to detect it!"

Because Suzy's intimidation is no joke."

<blank>

When you're in a stand-up fight, conquering it is the first step, right? And even Irving, who was listening by my side, interrupted me.

What? I didn't put up such a hurdle in my presence!

<blank>

I'm not intimidated in the hallway! But I'm not going to intimidate you in the hallway, because we're not in a standoff, okay?"

If you really intimidate me, you'll get away with a lot! That's why I told you to be careful!

Yes, Bibi is right! If Suzy were to intimidate a normal person, she could easily give that person a heart attack, right?"

<blank>

Oops! Excuse me!

Irving was so rude to me!

It's not that far, is it? Right?

<blank>

............ Huh? Huh? Why? Why are you all looking at me like that?

Why do not only Irving and Bibi, but even Mia and Lombardo smile thinly and look far away?

What? Why? What? ............ Is that so? Is that right?

<blank>

I was in a panic because you were about to unleash your intimidation! I was in a panic because you were about to unleash your intimidation!"

<blank>

Bibi was apparently trying to observe my handling of the young lady from the shadows until I let out a kill shot.

Bibi said he was watching to see if I had matured enough to handle the situation on my own.

You don't have to watch over that thing, just come in and help us right away!

However, he thought that the clouds were getting darker, so he hurried out to my side.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a good idea to be smiling or not, but it's good to be smiling! I didn't think you would try to kill me so hard while smiling!

I'm not pretending! But, but, I'm ...... sorry to bother you?"

In general, ......, there's no need for you to be straight with that little guy, you know! Frankly speaking! I wanted to say to him, 'You're a small, stupid, little thing who knows where he's coming from! I wanted to say something like that!

Stop it! Don't do that! It'll definitely turn into a war! Don't do that, okay?

I didn't tell you that!"

<blank>

Oooh, what the heck, I can easily imagine Bibi putting up a fight and a verbal battle with Miss Lurie. ......

<blank>

Well," he said, "not only were those little guys stupid, but they also seemed pretty slow! Those little guys were not only stupid, but they were so slow that they could not have understood the intimidation you let out!

But I think the kids who knew what they were talking about understood it. There were a couple of kids around me who had a different complexion, you know?"

I'm sure you're right," he said! You're in this school, you'd be crazy not to be here!"

<blank>

And Bibi, in response to Mia's words, pretended to think, "Hmmm," before answering.

<blank>

Anyway...! Put on what you can while you can! It's only a matter of time!"

<blank>

Bibi is saying terrible things.

Is that all there is to it? I looked around and saw Mia, Irving, and Lombardo all nodding their heads in agreement.

Everyone is still shid! Sic sic sic sic .......

<blank>

Well, I am aware of the fact that I can't keep wearing a cat's mask forever, though! Hmmm!

<blank>

It's not about that, it's about Karen now.

I am concerned about Miss Lurie's attitude toward Karen.

...... I should still do a little research on Grouse Mill, including the second son of the Niven family.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What should I do? Were you angry? You were angry, weren't you?

I'm sure you'll be able to relax, Miss Cordilia! Don't worry, I wasn't directing my anger at you."

But, but! I've done such a pushy thing and ......"

It's all right! We are not here to worry about such things! ...... maybe."

I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!

<blank>

Lucille had been trying her best to admonish Cordelia, who had been losing her composure ever since she entered the classroom.

The first group's Miss Cloud took care of the clash with the second group of girls in the hallway, and the angry atmosphere she let out at that time led to this mess.

Indeed, the angry tone she emitted made us feel as if we had been hit and reminded of the fact that we had been raised in a greenhouse.

No wonder Cordelia was a bit restless.

<blank>

Did Miss Lurie Diet and her friends of the second group feel nothing of that surge of anger?

Or is it that they have such a high tolerance for that level of anger that it doesn't matter?

...... No, that's as good as it gets.

Apart from Cordelia, who is trying hard to suppress her agitation, he looks sideways at his cousin, the other valet beside him, and shakes his head, "I don't think so.

In general, how is it possible that I didn't feel anything when it was uttered so close to me?

I'm sure they are tremendously insensitive ...... no doubt! and Lucille Moore concluded on this matter.

<blank>

If you look at my cousin Catherine Moore standing beside me, you can easily see that they are the epitome of insensitivity.

<blank>

Catherine didn't say a word beside Lucille, struggling to maintain her usual cool expressionless face, but her eyes were filled with tears, and her whole body kept shaking and shaking in small increments.

How upset are you? Lucille wanted to rush in, but ...... couldn't help it.

And yet, Catherine has a moderately keen sensibility. Lucille had always thought that she probably had the sharpest sensibility of anyone in this class.

I didn't realize it would be in this state. ......

<blank>

Are you all right, Catherine? Would you like me to escort you to the infirmary?"



I said, "Oh, you don't have to talk. You don't have to talk.

<blank>

Catherine purses her lips and gives a small shake of her head.

It's not surprising, Lucille thinks, since they themselves were angered by the rage quite up close and personal.

In fact, I was stuck for that moment, though not as stuck as Catherine.

<blank>

There were a few others who felt that presence, but it was clear from the second group of children that it was not all of them.

Lucille did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing that she could detect it.

But I also felt as if they were saying, 'If you can't perceive this level of detail, you are not qualified to stand in front of me.

I can feel a thin sheen of sweat on my back as I wonder if that was part of the power of the princess of Amkam.

<blank>

And there is one more person that I am concerned about. That girl who was at the center of ...... that event.

He seemed restless throughout, but at least now he seems relatively calm.

<blank>

I'm sure she's not at peace with it either. ......

"............"

<blank>

As if in response to Lucille's muttering, Cordelia raises her eyebrows and looks at her with a pained expression.

And Lucille Moore was quietly staring at the profile of Cordilia, who was staring at her ...... Karen Merlin, as if trying to figure out what was in her heart.
