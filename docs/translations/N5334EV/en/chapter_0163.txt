# 151 Karen's Red Shoes

"Oh, ......, oh, ......!"

<blank>

Annie drops the grip of the sword in her hand and lets out a cry of anguish.

His arms and legs tremble, he cannot stand and goes straight to his knees.

<blank>

I have no strength in my body. I seem to be rapidly losing energy and strength.

Pain runs through my entire body, and tears flow freely.

This is what Irving and Sis Sue were talking about. The reason they were saying that was because their bodies were not yet ready.

<blank>

You have told me so many times that it is important to do basic bodybuilding first. ...... Sorry Sis Sue.

<blank>

Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

Unable to endure the intense pain that racked her body, Annie crouched down on the spot with a cry of pain.

<blank>

You little shit!

<blank>

Fluke kicked Annie as hard as he could from right beside her.

<blank>

AUGH!!!!"

<blank>

Annie is kicked off and sent flying to the wall of the building, where she is struck hard.

<blank>

A, Annie ............!"

<blank>

Cordelia sees this and weakly shouts and tries to reach out her hand to Annie, but her body is too sore to move.

<blank>

I'll kill you, you little shit! I'll fucking kill you!

<blank>

Fluke, unable to contain his anger, threw away the piece of the cudgel that had been a magical tool in his hand and stepped toward Annie, who was crouching on the cobblestones with a horrified look on her face.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What? What? ...... this."

<blank>

Behind them, someone let out a bewildered sound.

<blank>

Karen Merlin stands stunned at the corner of the alley.

<blank>

"...... What is this? What does it mean? ...... Why?

I said, "Ka......Kare......n. Don't come ...... away ......."

Cody!

<blank>

Karen runs over to find Cordilia lying face down on the cobblestones. She kneels down beside her and reaches out to help her up, but is surprised to find that she is bleeding from her shoulder.

<blank>

Why? This ...... terrible!"

I'm sorry ...... Karen. I couldn't protect ...... you. ......"

What are you talking about, Cody? What am I going to do? So much blood! How did this happen? ......"

<blank>

That's because you're a ....... That's because it's all your fault, Karen."

<blank>

Parker approaches Karen with a grin and a twisted mouth.

<blank>

'It's my fault? ...... what, ...... what are you talking about? Parker."

<blank>

Karen takes out her own handkerchief and presses it against her bleeding shoulder, hoping to at least stop the bleeding, but Cordelia makes a small noise.

<blank>

In the first place! If you had listened to me from the beginning, none of this would have happened!

<blank>

I don't understand what you're saying, Parker. Why should Cody and the others have to go through all this if I don't do what you say?"

<blank>

Karen asks him without looking at Parker as she continues to administer first aid to Cordelia.

<blank>

Because he was against us. You naive young ladies have learned your lesson!"

<blank>

Gahaha," Parker said with a disgusted laugh, as Fluke approached from behind him, holding Annie's hair and dragging her body with a slurp.

<blank>

Annie?

<blank>

Karen, who was trying to get Cordilia, who was moaning in pain, to lean against the wall to make her feel as comfortable as possible, noticed Annie's appearance and shouted.

<blank>

What did you do? What the hell did you do to that girl?

<blank>

Karen spoke to them in the strongest terms she had ever heard.

Parker sniffs at the reaction, which is unexpected from those who know the normal Karen.

<blank>

"Hmph! Because that kid was trying to bite us. What's the best way to teach an undisciplined kid? Ha-ha-ha.

Karen Marlin. Let's get the rocks out."

<blank>

Suddenly, Karen asks what he is talking about.

<blank>

What are you talking about?" What are you talking about? I don't care what you're talking about, just let go of little Annie right now!"

'If you want me to let you go, give me the rock. We know you have it!"

"Ishi? What the hell have you been talking about all this time? What the hell are you talking about?"

Don't play dumb with me! I know you have it, you know! The red stone! Give me the red stone you carry so close to your chest!

I'm going to ask you, "...... Why, why? You know about this?"

I don't care what you think! I want it now!

<blank>

He said so, and threw Annie in his hand carelessly and roughly forward.

Slammed against the cobblestones, Annie lets out a little cry as if she's about to vomit, then rolls like a doll to a stop at Parker's feet.

When Karen sees this, her eyes widen and she involuntarily holds her mouth shut.

<blank>

What ...... what are you doing!!!!"

<blank>

Your two kids just ran into the house. ......, well, let's start with the little bitch.

<blank>

Parker then grabbed Annie's hair, which was lying at her feet, carelessly and lifted it up as if to show it to Karen.

<blank>

Give me what you've got, Karen, or I'll strangle the kid first. If you don't, I'll strangle the kid first."

"What are you talking about ...... Parker? Are you ...... insane?"

 You should have just shut up and listened to us! If you hadn't disobeyed us in the first place, none of this would have happened!"

"From my defiant ......? My ...... fault?"

Oh." That's right! It's you! It's all your fault! You set up those crazy people in that store. ......

<blank>

Parker's face goes red as Fluke gives Karen a probing look.

<blank>

It's all your fault! You're a big boy, you know that? You'd better grow up and do what we tell you! Or you'll be next in line for this kid, and then the little ones who ran inside the house!"

"Parker_...... you."

And if that's not enough, there you go, you chic ladies crawling miserably on your knees!"

"............"

You don't know your place, so that's what you're going to have to do! But don't worry! I'm going to use you at Mr. Fluke's store after this! You can learn how to flirt with men there!

<blank>

Parker laughs a sneering laugh at Cordelia and the others.

<blank>

"...... oooh ...... ka, kare ...... n ...... run away... Run... away."

<blank>

Karen's ears barely pick up the sound of Cordelia's voice as she mutters to Karen to run away, as if she is trying to shake her head.

Karen cowered in the hand that was supporting Cordelia and held her in place.

<blank>

Cody ............."

I'm sorry ...... Karen. Protect ...... and give ...... and it didn't happen. Protect ...... me and I'll protect ...... you."

No, Cody. It's ...... me who should apologize. Sorry, sorry Cody ......!"

<blank>

Karen's hand gently strokes Cordelia's hair.

<blank>

So, first of all, you need to be a big boy and do what I tell you to do!"

'If I do what you say, will you promise not to touch these kids?

<blank>

With her back to the men and holding Cordilia, Karen asks them a question.

<blank>

What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? You don't deserve it! Don't you get it yet? Yeah? They were trying to protect you! Huh! You got what you deserved!

<blank>

Karen looked at Parker with Cordilia in her arms.

Parker does not notice that the expression on his face has disappeared.

<blank>

'You take it for granted that I will do what you tell me to do?'

"Ah? That's a given, right? You're not allowed to disobey us from the start! I told you to know your place!

<blank>

Karen let Cordelia lean gently against the wall again, and then she stood up and faced them quietly.

<blank>

I don't care how much you people despise me."

<blank>

The color of fear that had been in Karen Merlin's eyes was now gone.

<blank>

That's my own decision."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, I made my own decision.

<blank>

When I decided to attend a school in Groudsmill, I was told by Niven's father, "There may be a backlash from the children because I decided to do this by force. However, I hope that the children will get along well with each other," Niven's father had told him.

At the time, I vaguely wondered if such a thing could happen. But the hit from Ruly was unexpectedly severe from the beginning.

She doesn't like that I'm being "singled out," she says.

I never thought I was being singled out.

So when I told her that was not the case, it only served to upset her feelings.

I remember having such an exchange several times, but at some point I gave up trying to understand her.

<blank>

If you argue when you see each other, just keep your distance.

Unnecessary conflict should not be.

<blank>

Your uncle also said. Your power is stronger than you think. Never do anything rash to wield your power."

<blank>

So I tried to stay away from them as much as possible. But it is difficult to do so in a small school.

<blank>

At some point, a small harassment began.

Before I knew it, things were missing, clothes were dirty, and water was sprayed on me from somewhere.

When the basket was destroyed, I knew I was losing my patience.

But then Brother Van shows up and asks me to endure.

I managed to put up with it at the time, but when they realized I wasn't saying anything, the number of harassments increased.

When he was about to lose his patience again, he was again admonished by his brother Van, and he relented.

As I repeated such things over and over again, a feeling of resignation grew up inside me.

<blank>

Somewhere along the way, all the kids at school had come to think that they could do whatever they wanted to me, as Parker just said.

<blank>

Yes, it was my choice.

I thought it could happen.

<blank>

But these kids are different.

<blank>

My uncle's words come back to me clearly now. Protect those you need to protect when you need to protect them! Your power is for that purpose," he said firmly, looking me in the eye.

<blank>

Why had I forgotten about it until now?

<blank>

"But ......, that doesn't make Dan or Nan, or Annie-chan, ......."

<blank>

Why was I so frightened and all I could think about was running away?

<blank>

"Get Cody to ...... my dear friend."

<blank>

I promised a long, long time ago that I would protect Dan, Nan, and ...... Cody. ......

<blank>

I'm not going to let this ...... get away with it."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Karen Merlin muttered quietly.

<blank>

<blank>

His eyes are not the weak ones they were just a few moments ago.

The eyes are filled with serenity, yet strong with power.

<blank>

Parker does not even notice this change in Karen.

A moment later, I lost sight of Karen, who should have been right in front of me.

<blank>

A moment later, without even a pause for doubt, the elbow of Parker's left arm receives an unexpected jolt.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

Parker definitely heard his left elbow make a funny sound at that moment.

He didn't even notice that Annie's hair, which he was holding in his left hand, had left his fingers.

<blank>

Parker received a further thrusting impact to the chest when his body moved slightly to the right due to that impact, which was received from the left.

<blank>

Karen Merlin sank down to just above the ground in front of Parker, spread the fingers of both hands as wide as she could to catch the ground, and then thrust upward with a kick using all her body's rhizomes on that axis.

The first blow to the elbow was also Karen's spinning kick, fired from a low position.

<blank>

Parker takes that kick from Cullen and is blown backward, rolling right in front of Fluke.

<blank>

Tekkyo ......."

<blank>

Fluke picked up the cudgel, a magic tool dropped by Parker, with veins appearing on his forehead and muttering hatefully.

<blank>

Don't fuck with me, you piece of shit! Don't fall asleep right now! Wake up! Parker!

<blank>

Fluke shakes the magic tool in his hand vigorously to the side, and magical light spills from it.

As it was, he poisoned Parker, who was moaning on the side, and kicked it hard.

<blank>

Drink what I gave you! You idiot!

"......a, ga. . is."

<blank>

Parker, lying on the cobblestone, realizes for the first time here that his left elbow is out of joint and tries to speak up, but the damage to his chest prevents him from doing so because he can't breathe.

Fluke kicked him out of the way, and as his body bounced, the ampoule spilled out of his pocket and scattered. Parker hurriedly picked one up with his right hand and poured its contents into his mouth at once.

<blank>

Karen meanwhile picked Annie up and sat her quietly beside Cordelia.

But then three canine monsters rush toward Karen.

<blank>

As if to indicate that control over the magical beasts has been restored, a glow of magical power overflows from the magical tool wielded by Fluke.

<blank>

Karen slid from her legs just off the ground to face the lone hexenbiest running toward her.

He then kicked the demonic beast in the jaw from below as it was.

The magical beast is crushed in the jaw, spurts blood from its mouth, and spins vertically as if it had been shot.

<blank>

From that position, Karen puts her hands on the ground and, using them as a pivot point, slams her heels, with centrifugal force, into the nose of the second magical beast from a low position.

The beast was smashed across the nose, and the force of the blow sent it flying toward the side.

<blank>

Karen instantly shrinks back her stretched body and immediately kicks off the cobblestones toward the third one.

The toe of Karen's loafer bites into the upper jaw of the hexenbiest, which opened its mouth to fang it at her.

The magical beast cannot close its mouth as it is.

Karen hooked her left heel on the head of the demonic beast as it was, and spun itself around while supporting its body with her hand. The body of the demonic beast was swung around by the momentum and slammed directly into the cobblestone pavement.

From the mouth of the hexenbiest, whose upper jaw is shattered and many teeth scattered, Karen's bloodstained shoes emerge.

<blank>

<blank>

Kareenaan! Kooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

Parker came at me angrily, raising his fist and punching me.

My left elbow, which I should have broken earlier, is also moving normally.

Karen scowled for a moment, but ducked Parker's fist to the side as he came at her and slammed his knee into Parker's stomach on the spot.

<blank>

I'm going to go to  and see if I can find the "Oh? is ......"

<blank>

The knee bites into the dove tail, and the pain is so intense that Parker's body bends over.

Karen kicked that gaping, thrust-out Parker's chin up from below.

With her legs swung up in a Y-shape, Karen's heel crushes Parker's jaw, causing her body to float upward.

Parker's body flutters in the air as broken teeth and blood flood from his mouth.

<blank>

Don't fuck with me!

<blank>

Behind him, Fluke came swinging his club.

Fluke's cudgel winds up with a gulp and comes right at Karen's head without hesitation.

However, Karen shifted her body slightly and handled it with her right hand in a casual movement. In the next instant, Karen's left elbow was buried in Fluke's right side.

<blank>

?" Goh!"

<blank>

Karen's heel swung down without a pause on the back of Fluke's head as he bent over, holding his side.

<blank>

Gobble!"

<blank>

He plunges face-first into the cobblestones, and Fluke rolls away with his nose and front teeth knocked out.

<blank>

From behind Karen, who was looking down at it, one of the demonic beasts that she had just slaughtered jumped at her.

<blank>

Karen quickly twisted her body around to avoid it and slammed her elbow into the side of its stomach where it was in contact with her own body.

No sooner had the hexenbiest been blown away by the elbow strike than it was able to position itself beyond it, when Karen put her hands on the ground and slammed a powerful kick from a low stance into its snout. Karen's leg felt the sensation of shattering bone.

<blank>

Normally, this would have been enough to slaughter the beast, but the beast was still moving at the point where it was blown away.

I notice that other magical beasts are also reviving and coming toward us.

<blank>

Karen remains poised, rhythmically stepping and breathing.

<blank>

<blank>

Come to think of it, my uncle once told me about it.

There are tough demonic beasts in the world.

<blank>

A guy who has several ---- heads is not afraid to come at you if you crush one of them.

On the contrary, they are really stubborn, repairing and growing back as soon as we see them.

But even these people are, after all, living creatures. There is a limit to their recovery.

Then just keep on damaging them until they reach their limits! ----

<blank>

I remember how excited I was to hear such a story from my uncle.

I also recall your mother laughing happily and saying, "Baat really is a brainiac.

<blank>

Karen's mouth was naturally turned up.

<blank>

With a slight movement, he ducks the magical beast coming toward him, swaying, striking it with his elbow as if dancing, and striking it with his centrifugal footsword. Then, as if stepping violently, he crushes its skull with his heel.

<blank>

Gogo no oh! Gareenooooo!"

Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

I feel that the power of the parkers, who keep getting up and coming back, is getting somewhat stronger.

The limbs are one size larger.

I saw a swinging fist shatter the cobblestones.

<blank>

He reduces his fist to the ground and slams another frontal kick into his downward-facing face.

This time, a crushed jaw does not stop the movement. Has toughness gone up?

<blank>

But! Then all you have to do is to go up a gear.

<blank>

If you clothe yourself in magic, the anklet you wear on your left ankle will emit a faint red light.

The body is very light. The sharpness of the body feels amazingly good.

<blank>

The demonic beasts and men who jump at you all at once from all around you are reaped from a low position with legs turned like frames in a wide area.

<blank>

How long has it been since I've had so much fun being physically active?

<blank>

Karen jumps after Parker, one of the attackers, who was reamed and literally bounced off the ground.

<blank>

When he catches up to you, he slams his heel into your face as if to shower you with it.

The nasal bone is crushed, several front teeth fly off, and gobbled up blood.

<blank>

Before long, Karen's shoes were stained red with the blood of crushed magical beasts and men.

The red magic from the anklet cloaks it, and every time Karen moves, the red light overflows and scatters.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Without pause, they continue to make magical beasts and men covered in blood. Despite the gruesome scene they are creating, they look as if they are dancing with joy.

<blank>

In her vague consciousness, Cordelia remembered Karen dancing happily as a child.

I feel like Karen is back to those days.

I thought Karen looked so beautiful, smiling and dancing now.

At the same time, however, I vaguely realized that this was causing a small tremor deep within me.

<blank>

<blank>

With shoes that sprinkle red light, Karen steps rhythmically. Every time she dances, every time she swings her legs, the magical beasts and men scatter blood.

<blank>

I feel my mood lift and lift.

I truly want to dance more and more.

<blank>

Every time she steps on the ground, every time she shatters, joy overflows in Karen's heart.

<blank>

Ah-ha♪"

<blank>

Her cheeks rose, and Karen Merlin let out a small squeal of pleasure.

<blank>

<blank>



<blank>

<blank>

It is a deep place where no light can reach.

<blank>

Ahhhh ......, finally sprouted."

<blank>

A shadow taking human form looked up at the void, let out a troubled exhale, squinted with amusement, and muttered quietly.
