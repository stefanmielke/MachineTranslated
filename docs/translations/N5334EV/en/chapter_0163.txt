# Chapter 151: Karen's Red Shoes

"Ah... u, ... ah!"

<b>

Annie dropped the grip of the sword she was holding and let out a groan of agony.

Her limbs trembled, and she couldn't stand, collapsing to her knees.

<b>

She felt powerless. It seemed like her will and stamina were rapidly fading away.

Pain coursed through her body, and tears began to flow uncontrollably.

What Irvin and Sister Sue had said was true. "It's still too early." "Even if you feel you can do it, you can't do it alone." The two had said that because her body was not yet fully developed.

<b>

They had taught her many times that it was important to first build a solid foundation for her body... I'm sorry, Sister Sue.

<b>

"Uaaahhh!!"

<b>

Unable to endure the excruciating pain, Annie crouched down while screaming.

<b>

"You little brat!!"

<b>

Fluke kicked Annie hard from the side.

<b>

"Aggh!!"

<b>

Kicked away, Annie was sent crashing into the wall of the building.

<b>

"A-Annie...!"

<b>

Seeing this, Cordelia weakly called out and tried to reach out to Annie, but her body wouldn't move due to the pain.

<b>

"You little brat! I'll kill you!!"

<b>

Fluke, still furious, threw away the broken piece of the magical tool he had in his hand and stepped forward with a terrifying expression towards Annie, who was curled up on the cobblestones.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What? What is this...?"

<b>

From behind them, someone let out a bewildered voice.

<b>

Karen Merlin stood there, dumbfounded, at the corner of the alley.

<b>

"What... what is this? What's happening? ... Why?!"

"Ka... Karen. Don't come here... run... away."

"Cordy!!"

<b>

Karen, seeing Cordelia lying on the cobblestones, instinctively ran over. She knelt beside her and reached out to help her up, but she was startled to notice the blood oozing from Cordelia's shoulder.

<b>

"Why?! This is... terrible!"

"I'm... sorry... Karen. I couldn't... protect you..."

"What are you saying, Cordy! What should I do? There's so much blood! How did this happen...?"

<b>

"That's because it's all your fault, Karen."

<b>

Parker approached Karen with a smirk on his face.

<b>

"My fault? ... What are you... what are you talking about, Parker?"

<b>

Karen took out her handkerchief to at least stop the bleeding and pressed it against Cordelia's shoulder, but Cordelia let out a small cry.

<b>

"To begin with! If you had listened to me from the start, this wouldn't have happened!!"

<b>

"I don't understand what you're saying, Parker. Why should I have listened to you for Cordy and the others to not end up like this?"

<b>

While continuing to administer first aid to Cordelia, Karen asked Parker without looking at him.

<b>

"It's because she defied us. That sheltered little lady learned her place, didn't she?!"

<b>

Parker laughed mockingly, and from behind him, Fluke grabbed Annie by the hair and dragged her closer.

<b>

"Annie?!"

<b>

Karen, who was trying to support Cordelia and make her more comfortable against the wall, noticed Annie's condition and exclaimed.

<b>

"What did you do?! What did you all do to her?!!"

<b>

Karen spoke to them with a strength she had never shown before.

Those who knew the usual Karen were taken aback by her unexpected reaction, and Parker snorted.

<b>

"Hmph! That brat came at us. It's best to teach a spoiled kid a lesson with their body, right? Hahaha!"

"Karen Merlin. Hand over the stone."

<b>

At Fluke's sudden words, Karen asked back, confused.

<b>

"What are you talking about? What do you mean? More importantly, let Annie go right now!"

"If you want her released, hand over the stone. We know you have it!"

"Stone? What are you talking about? What on earth are you referring to?"

"Don't play dumb!! We know you have it! The red stone! Hand over the red stone that you keep close to your chest!"

"... Why, why? This thing?"

"That has nothing to do with you! Just hand it over right now!!"

<b>

While threatening her, he carelessly threw Annie forward.

Annie hit the cobblestones and let out a small voice as she rolled like a doll, coming to a stop at Parker's feet.

Seeing this, Karen's eyes widened, and she instinctively covered her mouth.

<b>

"What are... what are you doing?!!"

<b>

"Your two brats have already run into the house, but... for now, we'll start with this little girl."

<b>

Saying this, Parker carelessly grabbed Annie's hair and lifted her up to show Karen.

<b>

"Hand over what you have, Karen. If you don't, I'll start by choking this girl to death."

"... What are you saying, Parker? Are you... out of your mind?"

"Ah?! Just shut up and do as you're told! If you hadn't defied us, it wouldn't have come to this!"

"I defied you... because? It's my... fault?"

"Yes! That's right! It's all your fault!! You stirred up those weirdos at that shop..."

<b>

Fluke glared at Karen with a probing gaze, and Parker's face grew red with anger.

<b>

"It's all your fault! Damn it!! Just quietly do as we say! Otherwise, after this girl, the little ones who ran into the house will be next!"

"Parker... you..."

"If that's not enough, then those spoiled ladies who are crawling around in misery over there!"

"............"

"You don't know your place, so this is what happens! But don't worry! After this, you'll be taught how to please men at Fluke's shop!"

<b>

Parker laughed derisively, mocking Cordelia and the others.

<b>

"... Ugh... Ka, Ka... ren... run... away."

<b>

Amidst this, Cordelia strained to whisper for Karen to escape, and Karen barely caught her words.

Karen tightened her grip on the hand supporting Cordelia and embraced her.

<b>

"Cordy..."

"I'm sorry... Karen. I couldn't... protect you... I wanted to... protect you..."

"No, Cordy. I'm the one who should apologize. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, Cordy...!"

<b>

Karen gently stroked Cordelia's hair.

<b>

"So first, you just quietly hand over what you have!"

"If I do what you say, will you promise not to harm these kids?"

<b>

Turning her back to the men while still holding Cordelia, Karen questioned them.

<b>

"Ah?! What gives you the right to make demands?! You have no qualifications for that! Don't you get it? They tried to protect you! Hah! It's your own fault!"

<b>

Karen, still holding Cordelia, turned her gaze towards Parker.

She noticed that the expression on Parker's face had vanished.

<b>

"You think it's natural for me to listen to you?"

"Yeah?! Of course it is!! You have no right to defy us from the start!! Know your place!!!"

<b>

Karen gently leaned Cordelia against the wall again, then stood up and faced them quietly.

<b>

"It doesn't matter how much you look down on me."

<b>

At that moment, the fear that had been in Karen Merlin's eyes vanished.

<b>

"That's because it's something I've decided for myself."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

That's right, it was my own decision.

<b>

When I decided to attend the school in Grusmil, Uncle Nivun had told me, "Since I pushed through with my decision, the children might resist. But please let the children figure it out among themselves."

At that time, I thought vaguely, "Is that how things are sometimes?" But the treatment from RuuRii was unexpectedly harsh from the very beginning.

She said, "I don't like being treated specially."

I didn't think I was being treated specially.

So even when I conveyed that, it only served to further provoke her feelings.

I remembered having such exchanges several times, but at some point, I had given up trying to gain her understanding.

<b>

If meeting face-to-face would lead to arguments, then I should keep my distance.

Unnecessary conflicts should be avoided.

<b>

Uncle also said, "Your strength is greater than you think. Never use your power recklessly."

<b>

So I intended to keep my distance from them as much as possible. But in a small school, that was difficult.

<b>

Before I knew it, small annoyances began.

Things would go missing, clothes would get dirty, and I would be splashed with water from somewhere.

When the basketball was broken, I thought that was the limit of my patience.

But at that moment, Brother Van appeared and asked me to endure.

I managed to hold on then, but when I didn't say anything, the number of annoyances increased.

Whenever I felt like I was reaching my limit again, Brother Van would admonish me and I would sheath my sword.

After repeating this many times, a feeling of resignation grew within me.

<b>

Before I knew it, all the children at school thought they could do anything to me, just like Parker said.

<b>

That's right, it was my choice.

I thought it would be fine for it to be that way.

<b>

But these kids are different.

<b>

Uncle's words now clearly resounded in my mind. "When it's time for you to protect, protect those you must protect! Your strength is meant for that." He said this to me while looking into my eyes, with great conviction.

<b>

Why had I forgotten this until now?

<b>

"But... even so, I can't let Dan and Nan, or Annie..."

<b>

Why had I only been thinking about fleeing in fear?

<b>

"Cordy... my precious friend..."

<b>

I had promised long ago to protect Dan, Nan, and... Cordy!

<b>

"I won't allow such terrible things... to happen."

<b>

<b>

<b>

Karen Merlin quietly murmured.

<b>

<b>

Her eyes were no longer the weak ones they had been just moments ago.

They were filled with a strong power, even as they held a sense of calm.

<b>

Parker didn't even notice Karen's change.

In the next instant, he lost sight of Karen, who had been right in front of him.

<b>

In a moment, without even a chance to feel puzzled, Parker's left elbow received an unexpected shock.

<b>

"---?!!"

<b>

At that moment, Parker distinctly heard a strange sound from his left elbow.

He didn't even realize that the hair he had been holding with his left hand had slipped from his fingers.

<b>

As his body slightly moved to the right from the shock he received from the left, Parker felt a further upward jolt to his chest.

<b>

Karen Merlin had crouched down to the ground just inches away, spreading her fingers wide to grip the earth, and using her entire body’s spring to launch a kick upward.

The first strike to his elbow was a roundhouse kick from Karen, delivered from a low position.

<b>

Parker, struck by Karen's kick, was sent flying backward, rolling right in front of Fluke.

<b>

"You...!"

<b>

Fluke's veins bulged on his forehead as he muttered angrily, picking up the magical tool that Parker had dropped.

<b>

"Don't underestimate me, you bastard! You better not be sleeping soon! Get up, Parker!!"

<b>

Fluke swung the magical tool he held fiercely to the side, causing magical energy to scatter everywhere.

He kicked Parker, who was groaning beside him, with great force.

<b>

"Swallow what you were told to take, you idiot!!"

"Ah, ugh. Gah."

<b>

Parker, rolling on the cobblestones, finally realized that his left elbow joint was dislocated, and he tried to scream, but the damage to his chest prevented him from taking a breath.

As he was kicked by Fluke, his body bounced, and an ampoule fell from his pocket, scattering on the ground. Parker hurriedly picked one up with his right hand and gulped down its contents.

<b>

In the meantime, Karen lifted Annie and quietly sat her down next to Cordelia.

But then, three dog-like magical beasts charged at Karen.

<b>

As if to indicate that he had regained control over the magical beasts, Fluke's magical tool overflowed with magical energy.

<b>

Karen slid to the ground, just inches away from one of the magical beasts charging at her.

Then, she kicked the beast's jaw from below.

The beast's jaw shattered, blood spewed from its mouth, and it spun around as if it had been struck.

<b>

From that position, Karen placed her hands on the ground and pivoted, delivering a powerful heel strike to the second magical beast's snout with centrifugal force.

The beast's snout was smashed, and it was sent flying sideways with that momentum.

<b>

Karen instantly retracted her body and immediately kicked off the cobblestones towards the third beast.

As the beast opened its mouth to bare its fangs at her, Karen's loafer's toe dug into its upper jaw.

The beast couldn't close its mouth.

Karen hooked her left heel onto the beast's head, supporting her body with her hands, and spun around. The beast's body was swung around with that force and slammed into the cobblestones.

Its upper jaw shattered, and many teeth scattered as Karen's blood-stained shoe appeared from the beast's mouth.

<b>

<b>

"KAREEEEN! You bastard!!!"

<b>

Parker shouted angrily, raising his fist to strike.

His left elbow, which should have been broken, moved normally.

Karen frowned for a moment, but then dodged Parker's punch and drove her knee into his abdomen.

<b>

"Ah? Gah..."

<b>

Parker's body bent in half from the pain of Karen's knee digging into his solar plexus.

Karen kicked upward from below, striking Parker's exposed jaw.

With her leg raised in a Y-shape, Karen's heel shattered Parker's jaw, lifting his body into the air.

Blood and broken teeth spilled from Parker's mouth as his body floated in the air.

<b>

"Don't underestimate me!!"

<b>

From behind, Fluke swung down his club.

Fluke's club cut through the air with a whoosh, approaching Karen's head without hesitation.

However, Karen slightly shifted her body and deflected it with a casual movement of her right hand. In the next moment, Karen's left elbow buried itself into Fluke's right side.

<b>

"?! Gah!!"

<b>

As Fluke doubled over, clutching his side, Karen's heel came crashing down on the back of his head without hesitation.

<b>

"Ugh!"

<b>

Fluke's face slammed into the cobblestones, breaking his nose and front teeth as he rolled over.

<b>

As Karen looked down at him, a magical beast that she thought she had defeated leaped at her from behind.

<b>

Karen instinctively twisted her body to dodge and struck her elbow into the side of the beast that was close to her.

The beast, blown away by the elbow strike, was met with Karen's powerful kick to its snout before it could regain its footing. Karen felt the sensation of bones breaking in her foot.

<b>

Normally, that would have been enough to take it down, but the beast was still moving as it flew away.

Before she knew it, the other magical beasts had revived and were charging toward her.

<b>

Karen maintained her stance, rhythmically stepping and regulating her breathing.

<b>

Now that I think about it, I remember hearing from Uncle that there are some incredibly tough magical beasts out there.

<b>

--- Some of them have multiple heads and can keep coming at you even if you crush one of them.

Not only that, but they can quickly regenerate or grow back, making them quite tenacious.

But even those creatures, in the end, are still living beings. There are limits to their recovery.

So all I need to do is keep dealing damage until they reach their limit! ---

<b>

I recalled how excited I was to hear Uncle's story.

I also remembered how my mother laughed cheerfully, saying, "Baat is really a musclehead."

<b>

A smile naturally crept onto Karen's lips.

<b>

She dodged a magical beast coming at her with a slight movement, swaying and dancing as she struck with her elbow, then delivered a centrifugal kick. Finally, she stomped down with her heel, crushing its skull.

<b>

"Go to hell! Garreeeen!!"

"Ughh!!"

<b>

It felt like the strength of Parker and the others, who kept getting back up, was somewhat increasing.

Their limbs seemed to have grown larger.

I saw their fists shatter the cobblestones as they swung down.

<b>

I buried my fist into the ground and kicked up at their downturned faces again.

This time, breaking their jaws didn't stop them. Were they getting tougher?

<b>

But! If that's the case, then I just need to shift up a gear.

<b>

As I wrapped my magical energy around me, the anklet on my left ankle emitted a faint red light.

My body felt incredibly light. The sharpness of my movements felt surprisingly good.

<b>

I swept away the magical beasts and men charging at me from all sides with wide, low kicks.

<b>

How long has it been since moving like this has been so enjoyable?

<b>

As I swept them away, literally sending them flying, I jumped after Parker, who had been knocked back.

<b>

As I caught up, I slammed my heel into his face.

His nasal bone crumbled, several front teeth flew out, and he spat blood.

<b>

Before I knew it, Karen's shoes were stained red with the blood of the shattered magical beasts and men.

The red magical energy from the anklet clung to it, and every time Karen moved, red light burst forth and scattered.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Continuously staining the magical beasts and men with blood, despite the gruesome scene it created, her figure looked as if she were joyfully dancing.

<b>

Cordelia, in a hazy state of consciousness, recalled the time when Karen had danced happily as a child.

It felt like the Karen from back then had returned.

Now, the smiling and dancing Karen looked incredibly beautiful.

Yet at the same time, she vaguely realized that this was causing a small tremor deep within her heart.

<b>

<b>

With shoes that scattered red light, Karen rhythmically stepped. With every dance, every kick, the magical beasts and men spilled blood.

<b>

She felt her spirits rising higher and higher.

She truly wanted to dance more, more than anything.

<b>

With every step she took, every thing she crushed, joy overflowed in Karen's heart.

<b>

"Ahh♪"

<b>

With flushed cheeks, Karen Merlin let out a small voice of delight.

<b>

<b>

◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇

<b>

It was a deep place where light could not reach.

<b>

"Ahh... finally sprouted."

<b>

A shadow taking the shape of a person looked up at the void, letting out a troubled sigh, and murmured softly with narrowed eyes in delight.
