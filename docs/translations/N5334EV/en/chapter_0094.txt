“...Is the adjustment... about this much? ...How is it? Is it showing properly?”

“Wow! Amazing, Thor-kun!! What is this?! A video phone?! How did you do it?!!”

“Yeah, well, it's a kind of magical communication. I got technical cooperation from various places, and it finally took shape.”

“Amazing... If this becomes widespread, the world will become so much closer, Thor-kun!!”

“No, I won't let this become widespread.”

“Eh?! Why not? It's such a convenient thing! Why?!”

“This kind of technology is still too early for this world. People's knowledge and consciousness haven't caught up to that level. You understand that, right, Suzu?”

“...”

“Even so, if we expand the world with something like this, the balance will be greatly disturbed. Technology should progress in accordance with the needs of the people.”

“...Yeah, that's true. Maybe you're right. If you've decided that, then that's fine.”

“This world only has knowledge and morals from the medieval period. Suddenly jumping ahead with technology will only bring about an unfortunate future. I think it's better not to have such things. For long-distance communication, the carrier pigeons we have now are enough.”

“...That's true. Hehe, but for that, you did make things like hair dryers, right? Is that okay?”

“Ah, that’s different. That’s that, and this is this...”

“Hehehe, sorry, sorry! I'm really grateful for it! Thank you! It's really helpful. ...But, I was thinking I might be able to see my father and mother-in-law's faces...”

“Sorry, that's impossible. This magical tool is exclusive to the two of us. Our magic symbols are engraved on each activation crystal, so it can't be used by anyone else.”

“...I see... Well, it can't be helped. Besides, Thor-kun, you don't plan to make any more of the same thing, right?”

“Yeah, I won't make any more. This is a system exclusive to me and Suzu.”

“Hehehe, being told it's something just for the two of us makes me a little happy♪”

“...Your father and mother-in-law have been wanting to see Suzu too. They've been worried about whether you're doing well.”

“...Yeah, ...I want to see them. I want to see them too...”

“But both of them can't leave here.”

“I can't go over there past the royal capital right now either...”

“...Just a little... just a little, wait for me.”

“...Thor-kun?”

“I will definitely come over there... to Suzu's place!”

“Really?! Can you come? Will you come?! Thor-kun!!”

“Yeah! I will definitely go!”

“It's a promise... a promise! Absolutely! Thor-kun!”

“I promise you, Suzu. Absolutely!”

“...Yeah, Thor-kun. I believe you! I'll be waiting... forever.”

“I will definitely come... definitely!”

“Yeah, Thor-kun... yeah!”

<b>

<b>

－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－

<b>

<b>

The first to notice was Bibi and Algernon. As expected.

Algernon let out a cry, and Bibi sat up from where she had been leaning on the cushion, sharply directing her gaze toward the direction the carriage was moving.

<b>

Next was Annemarie. Then Irvin, Lombard, and finally Mia.

<b>

“...Are there quite a few? How many do you think?”

“Seventeen... right! What should we do? They seem really eager!”

“I was just wanting to move my body. I'll handle it.”

“Do you need backup?”

“Hmm? Well, it should be fine. Ron, just stay with the carriage guard for now.”

“Leave it to me.”

<b>

Irvin took out his two-handed sword that he had stored under the seat and began to wrap the hilt and sheath with leather straps.

He probably intends to hit with it so it doesn’t come out... It might not cut, but getting hit with a metal rod is still pretty bad.

<b>

“Is something the matter?”

“Ah! No! It's nothing serious! I apologize if I offended you! My people are all rough country folk...!”

“No! Not at all! If there's anything you need, we would be happy to help, you know? Ha ha ha.”

<b>

The carriage we are riding in, which left Cooptown three days ago, is scheduled to arrive in Dekkenbel by noon today. The person I’m currently talking to, Bibi, is a fellow passenger named Roderick, who came to Amukam for business.

During our three-day journey by carriage, many passengers have come and gone, but we have been together from the beginning to the end of the journey, so we have become friendly.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

The stagecoach we are riding in is about the size of a one-box car on the outside, but the inside is large and spacious.

It has two sets of three-person seats facing each other, accommodating twelve people.

<b>

However, it’s not that twelve people are crammed into a small space.

For example, even if the large-bodied Lombard's family... Lombard, Aria, and Conrad sit side by side, there is enough room to sit comfortably.

Since the seats are so spacious, the three of us girls have more than enough room to sit.

So, at first, Bibi, who was sitting across from Irvin, has somehow moved over to this side.

If it can seat four girls comfortably like this, just how big is it?

Well, you could think of it as about the length of the back seat of a “microbus,” right?

<b>

But the distance between the facing seats is not cramped like in a “bus” where your legs are squished together.

You can stretch your legs enough to swing them freely while sitting.

If you stretch your legs while sitting, your toes can reach the opposite seat.

<b>

The reason it is so spacious compared to its appearance is that the carriage body has undergone spatial expansion through magical technology, allowing for about 1.5 times the actual capacity to be utilized, which is why it is so spacious. It truly lives up to its name as a “first-class express carriage.”

Thanks to that, this three-and-a-half-day carriage journey has been incredibly comfortable, and I am truly grateful for that.

<b>

<b>

Roderick is a person who has been good to us during this carriage journey.

<b>

After we departed from Masom on the first day, Roderick called out to me when I settled down. We exchanged greetings as fellow travelers.

<b>

Roderick McGavin's North Milia Trading Company is one of the largest buildings on the main street of Cooptown.

It seems they mainly deal in fabrics and leather, and they are one of Amukam's important clients.

Roderick and his companions finished their procurement arrangements in Amukam and said they were returning to their main store in Dekkenbel ahead of the cargo wagon with this express carriage.

<b>

“What a stroke of luck?! To think I would meet the princess of Amukam, known as the beautiful princess, during the annual procurement meeting!!”

<b>

After introducing himself, Roderick excitedly praised me, perhaps a bit too exaggeratedly.

<b>

“N-no! I’m not that great...!”

“No, no! That humble attitude is just as I heard! Truly impressive!!”

“Um, that’s not what I meant, I’m just a...”

“No! Even so, your beauty is as rumored! Truly deserving of being called the ‘Northern Treasure’!! What a feast for the eyes!”

“Eh? W-what? Wh-what?!”

<b>

I felt my face burning as I flustered while trying to respond to Roderick.

Bibi and the others were watching me with amused expressions.

Bibi had been telling me that I needed to have some awareness as the next village representative, but... there's no way I could do that!!

But in the end, seeing me getting teary-eyed and flustered from Roderick's flattery, Bibi shrugged as if to say, “Good grief,” and was about to step in between me and Roderick.

<b>

“Chairman, please ease up a bit. This young lady has been quite troubled since a while ago, you know? I know you like cute girls, but if you bombard someone you just met with flowery compliments, this old man will come off as suspicious!”

<b>

Before Bibi could lower her feet from the seat, a slender hand reached out and grabbed Roderick's elbow, pulling him back down into his seat.

<b>

“Ah, I see? ...I understand, Kuu Emel.”

“I apologize, young lady. Our chairman is quite rude. But he’s not a bad person, you know?”

<b>

A beautiful voice like a ringing bell came from the person next to Roderick.

She removed her deeply hooded cloak and bowed deeply to me.

<b>

“Please forgive my rudeness while seated. I am Kuu Emel, the manager of the North Milia Trading Company. I hope to be acquainted with you from now on.”

<b>

From under the hood flowed soft, reddish-brown hair.

The bangs reached down to her eyes, and the hair that brushed her cheeks resembled a long-haired Persian cat.

Her beautiful jade-green eyes sparkled like jewels, gazing at me with a smile.

A stunning beauty has just appeared!!

<b>

Feeling embarrassed for being called a beautiful princess and a treasure just moments ago, I felt even more flustered.

I feel like I understand Roderick's character now!!

<b>

But the biggest surprise was the triangular shape wrapped in chestnut hair on her head!

Those two ears that twitched slightly!!

Cat ears have arrived!!!

<b>

“Is this your first time seeing a demi-human?”

<b>

Kuu Emel said with a cheerful laugh as she noticed us staring wide-eyed at her adorable cat ears.

<b>

“W-well, I’ve seen someone from a distance in Cooptown, but... I’m sorry.”

“I apologize! We have such rude people!”

“Oh, I see. There aren’t many demi-humans in Amukam County, are there?”

<b>

Feeling my face heat up from having thrown an unreserved gaze, I apologized together with Bibi.

Kuu Emel smiled lightly, brushing off our rudeness, but... I guess Amukam might be seen as a rural area. Ugh, how embarrassing...

Huh? Wait? But I feel like I’ve had a similar exchange a long time ago? Where was it?

<b>

“I would be very pleased if we could get along during our journey and after we arrive in Dekkenbel.”

“Ah, yes! Likewise... I-I look forward to it!”

<b>

Kuu Emel smiled gently at us as she said that.

<b>

Thus, we became friendly with Roderick and Kuu Emel during this carriage journey.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

The distance from the town of Inmedio, where we departed this morning, to Dekkenbel is about 50 kilometers.

After taking a break in a town along the way, we plan to continue non-stop and arrive in Dekkenbel by noon.

Just as we were about to reach the small town of Palus, the rest stop, Bibi and the others sensed something.

<b>

And soon after, the carriage came to a stop.

Roderick opened the small window connecting to the driver's seat and asked the driver what was going on, and it seemed that a cargo wagon was blocking the road.

The carriage had been running through the wilderness until just a moment ago, but now we were close to town, with more trees around, having just entered a thicket.

In the middle of a path surrounded by trees, there was no way to detour.

<b>

“...How straightforward.”

“It’s quite a cliché development, isn’t it?”

<b>

Irvin and Bibi muttered in exasperation.

It’s really straightforward to block the road as soon as you enter a single road. Bibi let out a big sigh.

<b>

“Is something the matter?”

<b>

Roderick reacted to their words.

<b>

“No, they’re probably bandits, right?”

“!! What?! How do you know that...?”

“Well, it’s just... there’s an overwhelming killing intent. There’s a presence surrounding us that doesn’t even try to hide.”

“What?!”

<b>

Roderick looked out the window in surprise at Irvin's words, then turned back to the carriage, looking at Kuu Emel as if to ask.

Kuu Emel nodded silently in response.

I see... Kuu Emel seems to sense presences too.

I wonder if demi-humans have sharper senses than ordinary people?

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Can I take care of this?”

<b>

After speaking with the drivers through the window connecting to the driver's seat, Roderick turned to us and said that he would handle the situation.

<b>

“Those who commit robbery around here are usually desperate people.”

<b>

We are already very close to Dekkenbel.

According to Roderick, while the security in this area cannot be said to be perfect, it is rare for outlaws to attack an express carriage near a town.

If a report of a bandit group comes in from this distance, the knight order or the guard will move immediately.

Even if such foolish people existed, they would be dealt with before they could gather into a group of ten or twenty.

While it’s not common, if someone were to attack a carriage here, they would be nothing but those who have been expelled from the slums of Dekkenbel and have nowhere to go.

<b>

“They don’t want to cause unnecessary trouble either. If they can settle things peacefully without doing something irreversible, that would be best.”

<b>

I was somewhat shocked by Roderick's mention of “slums.”

So, there is a gap between the rich and poor in this world too... I realized something so obvious only now.

Thinking about how blessed I was during my time in Amukam, I can’t thank Papa Howard and Mama Sonia enough.

Roderick said he wants to prevent those people from becoming criminals.

He also said that negotiating well to resolve things without escalating the situation is a skill.

<b>

“Also, giving those with nowhere to go something to do is part of my work.”

<b>

I wonder if Roderick is involved in some charity work?

But, the presence surrounding us doesn’t seem like it can be resolved with such peaceful negotiations...

<b>

Ignoring Kuu Emel and our concerns, Roderick raised his hand to indicate he was fine and got off the carriage.

He then told the two sitting in the driver's seat to stay as they were and stepped forward, calling out for a representative.

<b>

The vehicle blocking the road was a medium-sized covered wagon.

It was certainly not something that could be described as clean, with various scratches and damages visible all over, making it look quite old.

However, it was clear that the damage was not due to wear and tear from use, but rather that all the scratches were relatively new, indicating that the user was handling it carelessly.

Several people had already dismounted from the covered wagon and were moving around restlessly, peering at us.

<b>

Roderick stopped about halfway between our carriage and the covered wagon, seemingly waiting for a response to his call.

Irvin also got off and stood behind him, holding his two-handed sword and watching the situation.

Lombard also got off the carriage and stood in front of Irvin.

This is quite intimidating.

Just Lombard standing there makes the people coming from the front back off.

<b>

As expected, the people in front of the thicket split to the left and right, most of them moving to surround Roderick and Irvin from both sides.

A few others were moving toward our carriage, keeping a bit of distance among the trees.

Of course, Bibi and the others from Amukam noticed that too.

<b>

Then, one person stepped forward from the back of the group.

Tilting his head, he patted his shoulder with the short sword he held and walked over, swaying his body.

He walked in a strangely bow-legged manner... Doesn’t that make it hard to walk? He had a creepy grin on his face.

<b>

Looking closely, the others began to reveal themselves from behind the trees.

They all looked to be around twenty years old. While they were all armed, the weapons they held looked quite shabby. I wonder if they even maintain them? They all seemed rusty.

Their gear was mismatched too. Some wore makeshift leather armor, while others had half a breastplate... Why do they dress so sloppily?

The materials looked like thin leather from the horses or cows around, and the iron plates were so dented that they looked like they were made of paper.

How can they look so relaxed with such equipment?

<b>

“Hey! Old man! Do you have something to say to us?!”

<b>

The one who stepped forward grinned widely and shouted at Roderick in a loud, threatening voice.

He had red and blue highlights in his hair, and wore multiple piercings not only in his ears but also in his nose and lips.

He wore thin, colored glasses on his nose, and his chest was wide open, revealing several jangling gold chains.

He looks so flashy!!

He certainly doesn’t look like someone who has been expelled from the slums and is desperate!

You could say he’s a “punk.”

That loud voice was probably meant to intimidate.

<b>

Roderick seemed to realize this too, as his face twitched slightly.

It wasn’t because he was scared of the shout, but because he realized he had misjudged the situation.

<b>

“Could you move the wagon blocking the road? If you’re having trouble moving it, we can help.”

“Ah?! Trouble?! Yeah, that’s right! It’s a hassle! Ain’t it?!”

<b>

Saying that, he turned to his companions and burst into laughter. The others joined in, laughing foolishly.

It’s clear they’re not very bright! Just from this exchange, it’s obvious these guys are low-quality punks!

<b>

“If you need anything, just let me know. I can help if it’s within my means.”

<b>

Roderick, undeterred by these guys, continued to negotiate.

He’s braver than I expected.

He’s not just a smooth-talking old man. I’ve gained a bit of respect for him.

<b>

“Need something? Yeah! To pass through here, we need a toll! Right?! Hey?!”

“If it can be settled with money, I can pay. If it’s not enough, I can prepare it in town.”

“Ah?! What are you saying? There’s no way we’re letting you go to town! You pay here! Right here!!”

<b>

“Hey! Masuka! These guys are wearing the uniforms of the school in the upper district of Dekkenbel! They must be former noble brats!”

“If you threaten their parents for money, you can get as much as you want, right?!”

<b>

It seems some of them noticed the uniform Irvin was wearing.

But... threatening Harry-san for money? 

Wow... even if they don’t know, they’re really reckless...

Bibi and Mia are looking at me with exasperated expressions.

<b>

“Eh? Threaten their parents?! You idiots!! I can’t be bothered with that! It’s a hassle!! Besides, what’s with this kid? He’s carrying a big sword! Hey! Are you really going to do something with that?! Can you even draw it?!”

<b>

The flashy guy, probably the leader named Masuka, shouted at Irvin.

He seems restless and loud.

In contrast, Irvin hasn’t moved a muscle!

<b>

“If you try to draw that sword, I’ll stab you, old man! Gahaha!”

<b>

The flashy guy tapped Roderick’s shoulder with the belly of his short sword.

Roderick tensed for a moment, but Irvin remained still with his arms crossed.

Because! This is within Irvin’s range.

<b>

If Irvin wanted to, he could move the moment that guy tried to hurt Roderick and take him down.

<b>

“Hey! Hey! There’s something amazing in the carriage!!”

<b>

At that moment, the rear door of the carriage was roughly opened.

The door next to where we were sitting opened, and one of the punks peered in, his eyes widening with delight as he shouted.

<b>

“Whoa! What a catch!!”

<b>

The opposite door was opened, and two more punks peeked in.

The punks grabbed Bibi and Mia by the arms and roughly dragged us out of the carriage.

Bibi let out a “Kyaa” as she tried to act delicate, but it seemed a bit forced, didn’t it?

When I shot a slight glare at Bibi, she turned her gaze elsewhere.

<b>

“Whoa! This is amazing!”

“Can I touch her?! Let me have a feel!”

“Hey! Stop it!”

<b>

The guys were glued to Mia’s chest.

I can understand their feelings, but that’s mine!! Are they ready to face the consequences?!! Grrr!!

<b>

By the way, the weapons these guys have are really terrible!

The knife that the guy pulling Mia out of the carriage had was all chipped and damaged.

Do they even sharpen it? Can it even cut?

With such a knife, they couldn’t even scratch the fabric made from the threads of the Brown Crawler we’re wearing, right?

Well, where I’m wearing it is a maiden's secret!!

<b>

“Stop! Don’t lay a hand on them!”

<b>

Roderick noticed the commotion in the back and called out to us.

<b>

“Ah?! Shut up, old man! Don’t move!!”

<b>

The punk named Masuka suddenly raised his voice, grabbing Roderick’s chest and pressing the blade of his short sword against his neck.

<b>

“Ugh! Ugh!”

“C-Chairman!!”

<b>

Kuu Emel, who had also been dragged outside and was being restrained by two punks, saw Roderick about to be harmed and slipped out of the grip of the two holding her, quickly running forward.

Her movements were just like a feline.

<b>

“If anything happens to them, you won’t get away with it!!”

<b>

Without flinching at the blade pressed against his neck, Roderick shouted loudly at the lawless punks.

He’s really brave! Yes! I’ve gained even more respect for Roderick!

<b>

As Kuu Emel ran toward Roderick, Irvin stepped in to protect her, indicating it was too dangerous.

Huh? Isn’t that a knightly move to protect a woman?

I could see Bibi’s displeasure rising sharply for a moment...

<b>

“Hey?! Don’t give me orders!! You bastard!!! Shut up, old man!!!!”

<b>

Masuka tightened his grip on Roderick’s collar while pulling the short sword back to stab him.

Ah, this guy is the type who doesn’t care about human life at all.

He’s about to take a life just because he doesn’t like Roderick’s attitude toward him!

It’s clear from his actions that he’s someone who has taken lives without a second thought, treating it like plucking flowers.

<b>

Irvin was delayed in his initial movement because he was holding Kuu Emel back. At this rate, he wouldn’t make it in time to stop the blade from reaching Roderick.

While it wouldn’t reach the point of life-threatening danger, it was unavoidable that Roderick would be harmed.

<b>

However, I absolutely refuse to allow even a scratch to be inflicted on Roderick.

<b>

In that moment, a sharp crack echoed through the area.

<b>

That was the sound of Masuka, the punk, being blown away and reduced to a pile of rags.

<b>

I had moved in an instant to deliver a light backfist to his face... or rather, a precise back flick of my fingers? I just tapped him lightly with my fingertips...

<b>

If it were the village kids... like Stefan or Irvin, they would be rolling around screaming, “Ouch! Ouch!!”...

But it doesn’t work that way with outsiders.

I feel like Annemarie is giving me a side-eye again.

<b>

The guy who was blown away seemed to have his face caved in and all his front teeth shattered.

He was thrown against trees and rocks, and it looked like he was in terrible shape, but... ugh! He’s still alive.

He’s bent and broken all over, but somehow he’s still alive.

<b>

And as if that was a signal, the others from Amukam began to take action.

<b>

Mia punched the body of the guy who was holding her with a twisting blow.

The impact must have penetrated his body; he probably broke his spine... the punk who took the hit was spitting out something like liver from his mouth and twitching.

<b>

Bibi was even more ruthless.

She slipped into the blind spot of the guy holding her and delivered a kick to his nape, breaking it.

The guy hit the ground, foaming at the mouth and twitching.

For a moment, his neck must have been at a strange angle... but how is he still alive...?

<b>

Annemarie struck the throat of the one who was holding her and the one who was entangled with Mia with a knife hand, taking them down.

The faces of the two, whose airways were completely crushed, had already turned purple, and they were writhing in agony.

<b>

All three of them are clearly going for the kill, aren’t they...?

Even if they’re minors, the women of Amukam are really scary...

<b>

In contrast, Irvin and Lombard’s opponents were in strange positions, but they didn’t seem to be in any life-threatening danger.

Irvin, the moment I moved, jumped toward the six guys on his right, swinging his two-handed sword in quick succession, taking them down in an instant.

He then jumped to the opposite side of the carriage and took down the four there just as quickly.

<b>

Lombard, having lost sight of Kuu Emel, swatted away the two punks who were trying to chase after her with his thick arms, sending them flying.

<b>

The ones blown away by Irvin and Lombard were all slammed against trees and rocks, places where they would definitely take damage.

None of them landed gently on bushes or grass.

So, almost all of them had their limbs pointing in strange directions.

This is pretty bad too! But I have no sympathy for them!!

<b>

“...W-what is this...?”

<b>

Roderick seemed unable to hide his surprise at how quickly the situation had resolved.

<b>

“So this is... this is the power of Amukam... I see... I see!”

<b>

Supported by Kuu Emel, Roderick stood up, nodding as he spoke.

I felt a bit guilty since Roderick got rolled over when I blew away the punk.

<b>

“What should we do with these guys?! If we leave them like this, they’ll die...! Su! Can you heal them properly?!”

<b>

Just as I was about to turn my body to help Roderick, Bibi called out to me.

<b>

“Eh? I can heal them... but they’ll all be back to full health, right? I can’t do something like healing them moderately.”

“Ah! Right! ...Fine! It’s a hassle, but I’ll do it! Mia! You bind them one by one! ...Wait! What’s wrong, Su?!”

<b>

Then I remembered someone I was concerned about and went back to the carriage to retrieve my silver sword, pulling out one of the blades and spinning it in my hand, pointing the tip slightly northeast.

<b>

“...Hmm... there’s one person escaping, but... what should we do?”

“Someone escaped from here?!”

“No, earlier. Before they blocked the road with the carriage.”

<b>

That’s right, long before Bibi and the others noticed, I had detected them within my range.

I had sensed that one person had separated from the group before they started blocking the road.

Since they had been moving together until they separated, I assumed they were probably a comrade...

I was a bit unsure whether I should secure this person as well.

<b>

“Hmm! So, can you incapacitate them and hold them up?!”

“Umm, they’re about a kilometer away now... I can’t hold back, so if I explode, I think it’ll be a problem, right?”

“Eek! It sounds like I won’t be able to eat hamburgers for a while, so let’s skip it!”

“Okay, understood.”

“For now, they don’t seem to have any ill intentions, right?!”

“Yeah, for now. But I’ve sensed their presence, so if anything happens, I can catch them.”

“Please do! For now, let’s deal with the ones in front of us!”

<b>

Bibi treated only those who seemed to be in danger, while Mia used the vines she summoned with magic to bind the gasping punks.

After that, Irvin and Lombard piled them up in the covered wagon, and that was the end of it.

<b>

These guys will be taken to the guards in Palus, pulling this covered wagon along.

We can’t leave them here, so it’s an extra hassle, but it can’t be helped.

<b>

I wonder if the one who escaped had a falling out with these guys?

I feel like I’ve met them somewhere before... where was it again?

Well, it’s fine for now. I’ve at least “seen” their name, so if anything happens, I’ll respond immediately.

<b>

“Jules Nahl,” I’ll make sure not to forget that.

<b>

<b>

<b>

In the end, that day, we ended up passing through the northern gate of Dekkenbel over two hours later than planned.

<b>

Thank you for reading!

<b>

Next time, we will finally arrive at the main stage of Chapter 3, Dekkenbel! 

<b>

I missed the timing to insert the dream scene...＾＾；

There might be more additions in the future, so please bear with me. 

Thank you for your understanding m(_ _)m
