"...... adjustments are ...... like this? How's ......? Is it working?"

I'm soooo proud of you! That's great, Thor-kun! What is this? A videophone? How did you do that?

"Yeah, well, I guess you could say it's a magical communication. I got technical assistance from a lot of places, and it finally took shape.

"Great ....... When this becomes widespread, the world will be a whole lot closer, Mr. Thor!"

No, we won't spread this."

What? Why? Why? Why?

This kind of technology is not ready for this world. People's knowledge and awareness have not caught up to that level. Tin knows that, doesn't he?"

"............"

And yet, if you expand the world with something like this, the balance will be greatly upset." Technology should just go along with what people want."

I'm sure you're right. Thor, if that's what you decide, so be it."

The world has only medieval knowledge and moral values. Suddenly advanced technology will bring only an unhappy future. I don't think we need such a thing. For long-distance communication, the pigeons we have now are sufficient.

You said, "...... I guess so. Hmmm, but you made me a hair dryer or something for that matter. Is that thing any good?"

"Oh, that's that, that's that, that's that, that's that. That's that one, that's that one. ......"

I'm sorry! I'm grateful for your help! Thank you! You've been a big help. ...... but I thought, well, maybe I'll get to see my father-in-law and mother-in-law's faces ......."

Sorry, I can't do that. This grimoire is for the two of us. Each activation crystal has our magic crest engraved on it, so no one else can use it.

I see ......, that can't be helped. Besides, Thor, you're not going to make any more of the same, are you?"

"No, I won't make it. This is a system for me and Tin.

"Hmmm...I'm kind of happy to be told that it's just the two of us..."

"............Dad-in-law and mother-in-law miss Tin, too. I keep wondering how they are doing."

"......Yes, ...... I miss you. I miss you too. ......

But we can't both leave.

I can't go beyond King's Landing to you right now either. ......

"...... just a little bit, ...... just a little bit, just hold on."

"...... Thor you?"

I'll be there ...... and I'll be at Tin's!"

Really? Can you come? Can you come? Thor!

Oh, I'll be there! I'll be there!"

'Promise ......, promise! Never! Mr. Thor!"

I promise you, Tin. I promise!"

I'm going to go to "...... Yeah, Thor, I know. I believe you! I'll be waiting for you. ...... all the way."

I'll be there ...... I'll be there!"

"Unh, Thor, ...... yeah!"

<blank>

<blank>

-*** --****--****--****--****--****--****--****--****--****-

<blank>

<blank>

It was Bibi and Algernon who noticed it first. It was quintessential.

Algernon squeaks a single time, and Bibi raises her body, which had been resting on the cushion, and looks sharply in the direction of the carriage's travel.

<blank>

Next is AnnaMary. Then Irving, followed by Lombardo, and finally Mia.

<blank>

"Are there a lot of ......? How many do you think?"

You're 17 ......! What do you think? You seem to be in the mood for it!"

I just wanted to get moving. I'll do it."

Do you need a follow-up?"

Hmm?" Well, it'll be all right. Ron, just stay with the carriage guard in case."

I got it.

<blank>

Irving took out his own two-handed sword, which he had tucked under his seat, and began to wrap the sword-bar and scabbard with leather straps, tightening them around each other.

I guess they're going to make sure the sheath doesn't fall out and hit you with that thing: ....... It won't cut you, but it's the same as being hit with an iron bar, so this would be pretty bad.

<blank>

Can I help you?"

Oh! No, it's not a big problem! It's not a big problem! I'm sorry if I offended you! We're just a bunch of crass country folk. ......!"

No, sir! No, sir! If you need something, we can help you. I was wondering if we could help you. ...... Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

The carriage in which we are riding, which left Copetown three days ago, is scheduled to arrive in Dekenbel before noon today. The person talking with Bibi now is Roderick, another passenger who had come to Amkamu on a business trip.

During the three days of the carriage ride, many passengers got on and off, but these people have become good friends with me because they have been with me from the beginning to the end of the trip.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The stagecoach we are riding in looks about the size of a one-box car, but it is large and spacious inside.

It seats 12 passengers, with two sets of three seats facing each other.

<blank>

But it's not like 12 people are crammed into a small space.

For example, if Lombardo's large family ......, Lombardo, Aria, and Mr. Conrad sit side by side, there is enough room for them to sit comfortably.

The seats are so spacious that there is plenty of room for the three of us girls to sit down.

So, Bibi, who initially sat across from Irving alongside him, moved to a seat on this side of the room before he knew it.

It is big enough for four girls to sit on it like this. I'm talking about how big it is.

Well, think of it as about the length of the back seat of a "microbus".

<blank>

But the distance between the seats facing each other is not so narrow that one's legs are held down like in a "bus".

You can stretch your legs out enough and even swing them around from the knees down while sitting in the seat.

If you extend your legs while sitting down, your toes will reach the seat across from you.

<blank>

The reason why it is so spacious compared to its appearance is that the carriage's body has been magically expanded to use 1.5 times more space than its actual capacity, which is why it is so spacious. It is a "special express carriage," as they call it.

Thanks to this, I was able to spend this three-and-a-half-day carriage ride in comfort and ease, and I am very grateful for that.

<blank>

<blank>

Mr. Roderick is a fellow coach traveler and a good friend.

<blank>

After leaving Masom on the first day, Roderick approached me just as I was getting settled. We greeted each other as fellow travelers.

<blank>

Roderick McGovern's Northmilia Trading Company was one of the two largest buildings among those lining the main street in Copetown.

They mainly purchase cloth and leather goods, and are one of AMCAM's most important customers.

Roderick and his staff told us that they had made arrangements to stock up in Amkamu and would be returning to Dekenbel, where the main store is located, in this express wagon, one step ahead of the wagons.

<blank>

What a fortuitous event! I never thought I'd get to meet the Princess of Amkam, renowned for her beauty, at my annual stocking stand!"

<blank>

After we introduced ourselves, Roderick looked excited and asked me if I was overreacting. He lifted me up in his arms and asked me if I was being a bit dramatic.

<blank>

No, no. I'm not that big of a deal! I'm not such a big deal. ......!"

'No, no! That humble attitude is just as I've heard! It's just as I've heard!"

"Oh, well, that's not what I meant, I'm just ......

No," she said! Still, it is as beautiful as the rumors say! It deserves to be called the 'Treasure of the North'! It's a real treat for the eyes!"

What? Huh? Na, na, na, what? Shih-ho?"

<blank>

I was feeling my face burning, and I was trying to keep Mr. Roderick company, but no matter how I tried, I just couldn't get him to do anything.

Bibi and his friends are determined to watch over me with a smirk on their faces.

Bibi told me that I should be aware of the fact that I am the next head of the village!　She said something like that, but ......, that's absolutely impossible!

But in the end, Bibi, who couldn't bear to see me floundering with tears in my eyes at Roderick's lifting, cowered his shoulders as if to say, "Oh, dear," and tried to get out of his seat to get between me and Roderick.

<blank>

Chairman, please leave her alone. This young lady has been troubled by you since a moment ago. I know you like pretty girls, but if you keep bombarding your new acquaintance with all kinds of beautiful words and phrases, she's going to think that you're a suspicious old man! I'm sure he'll think you're a stinky old man.

<blank>

Before Bibi could get her feet down from the seat, a slender hand reached out and grabbed Roderick by the elbow, pulling him halfway to his feet and pulling him back into the chair.

<blank>

Oh, yeah?" ...... Okay, okay, Cu Emel."

I am sorry, Miss. Our chairman was rude. Even this is not a bad person, you know?"

<blank>

A beautiful voice, like rolling bells, echoed gently from the person beside Mr. Roderick.

He took off his hood and bowed deeply to me.

<blank>

Forgive me for sitting here. My name is Cu Emel and I am the manager of the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce. Please do not hesitate to get to know me.

<blank>

Flowing out from under the hood was a soft reddish chestnut brown hair.

The loosely webbed bangs reaching down to her eyes and the hair overflowing to tickle her cheeks reminded me of a long-tailed Persian cat.

Her beautiful jade green eyes sparkle like jewels as she stares at us smiling.

A very beautiful woman jumped out at me!

<blank>

I am embarrassed to have been called a beauty and a treasure until now.

I feel like I know who Roderick is!

<blank>

But the biggest surprise is the triangle wrapped in chestnut hair on top of that head of hers!

Those two twitching ears!

Cat ears are here!

<blank>

Is this your first time seeing the Half-Breed?"

<blank>

We couldn't help but open our eyes and look at the adorable cat ears that suddenly appeared in front of us, and Cu Emel laughed and said something like that.

<blank>

'Well, you know, I've seen some of you in Copetown who are far away, but ...... Smithsonian.'

I am sorry! They were all so impolite!"

"Oh, yes, there aren't many half-breeds in Amkham County, are there?

<blank>

I apologized with Bibi, feeling my face burn at the thought of having cast an unkind glance at him.

Cu Emel lightly brushed off our rudeness with a smile, ......, but I think he might have thought that Amkam was a countryside. U~~, I'm embarrassed .......

Hmm? Huh? But I think we've had an exchange similar to this one a long time ago? Where was it?

<blank>

I would be very happy if you would remain friends with me during my trip and after I arrive in De Kembel."

Oh, yes! It's ...... too, thank you very much!

<blank>

Cu Emel said this to us with a gentle smile.

<blank>

Thus, we and Roderick and Cu Emel became friends during this carriage ride.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The distance from the town we left this morning, Immedio, to De Kembel is about 50 kilometers.

After a stop at a town along the way, the coach will continue nonstop, arriving at De Kembel before noon.

Just as they were about to reach the small town of Palouse, their rest stop, with only 10 minutes left on the wagon, Bibi and the others sensed the presence of a man who was about to arrive.

<blank>

And the carriage stopped in less than a few moments.

Roderick-san opened a small window leading to the governor's seat and asked the governor what was going on, and it seemed that a wagon was blocking the road.

The wagon had been driving through the wilderness earlier, but now the town was nearing and the trees were growing, and it had just entered a wooded area.

It is impossible to go around a single road surrounded by trees, even if it is a wilderness with nothing around.

<blank>

"...... is easy to understand, oi."

This is getting pretty sticky!"

<blank>

Irving and Bibi muttered dismissively.

It's really easy to understand, like blocking the road as soon as you get to one street. Bibi is also letting out a big sigh.

<blank>

Can I help you?"

<blank>

Mr. Roderick responded to their words.

<blank>

"No, they're probably just pickpockets, right?"

! How did you know that? How do you know that ......?"

What a ...... leaking murderous atmosphere. There's a sense of not even trying to hide it, and it's surrounding us."

What?

<blank>

At Irving's mention, Roderick looked out the window at the outside of the carriage as if surprised, then turned his attention back to the inside of the carriage and looked at Cu Emel as if to ask him.

Cu Emel nodded silently at that.

I see... ......, Cu Emel seems to be able to tell if there's a sign or not.

Do half-breeds have sharper senses than normal people?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I think I can handle this part."

<blank>

Roderick-san spoke with some of the ministers at the window leading from the carriage to the ministers' table, and then turned to us and said, "I am very happy to be here.

Mr. Roderick said he would take care of those guys.

<blank>

There's no one around here who would be willing to pick up a few things, except for the very well-to-do.

<blank>

This place is already right under Dekenbel's nose.

According to Mr. Roderick, the area is certainly not that safe, but there are not many outlaws who would attack a special carriage on a street near a town like this.

If reports of banditry were to come in at such a distance, the knights and guards would suddenly be on the move.

Even if there were such fools, they would have been defeated before they could be grouped into groups of 10 or 20.

It is not often, but if anyone would attack a carriage in a place like this, it would be someone who has been removed from the Dekenberu slum and has nowhere else to go.

<blank>

They don't want to do anything rash," he said. It would be better if we could get things done peacefully without provoking them before they do something irreversible.

<blank>

I was more than a little shocked to hear Roderick's story of 'slumming it.

Well, there is a gap between the rich and the poor in this world too. ...... I just realized such an obvious thing.

When I think about how blessed I was to spend my time at Amcam, I can't thank Papa Howard and Mama Sonia enough.

Roderick says he wants to prevent such people from becoming criminals.

He also said that the art of negotiation is to settle things well without making things difficult.

<blank>

Besides, it's part of my business to give those who have nowhere else to go something to do.

<blank>

Does Mr. Roderick also do some kind of charity work?

But, you know, the people who are surrounding us right now are not giving any indication at all that such a gentle negotiation is going to be possible. ......

<blank>

Roderick got out of the carriage, raising his hand and assuring us that he was fine, regardless of the concerns of Cu Emel and the rest of us.

He then asked the two people sitting in the chairs to remain seated, and stepped forward and shouted loudly for a representative to come forward.

<blank>

The road was blocked by a medium-sized covered wagon.

It was not very clean, and as if it was old, there were scratches and chips here and there, large and small.

However, it does not look as if the scratches were caused by use, but all the scratches are relatively new, and it is clear that they are the result of the user's careless handling.

Around the wagon, several people had already alighted and were moving restlessly as if they were watching us.

<blank>

Roderick stopped halfway between our carriage and the wagon, waiting for us to answer his call.

Irving got off with him and was one step behind him, carrying a two-handed sword and looking at him with his hands crossed.

Lombardo also got out of the carriage and is standing behind Irving and the others, in front of the carriage.

This is intimidating.

Just having a big-bodied Lombardo standing there will keep the guys from coming straight at you - right?

<blank>

As expected, the people in the front in the woods split to the left and right, and most of them were moving to surround Roderick and Irving from the left and right in the distance.

I can see a few more of them moving a short distance away among the trees toward our carriage.

Of course, Bibi, Irving and the rest of Amcam are aware of this.

<blank>

Then, one guy from the back of the group came forward to the center of the group.

He tilts his head, taps his shoulder with the short sword in his hand, and walks over, shaking his body.

He's strangely crabby. ......, isn't that hard to walk in? He's grinning and smiling soooo disgustingly.

<blank>

As I looked, others began to emerge from the surrounding trees.

All of them are around 20 years old. They are all armed to a point, but the weapons in their hands are really poor. Are they taking good care of their weapons? All of them have noticeable rust on them.

The equipment they are wearing is also all a bit odd. Some were wearing leather armor, others only half breastplates (?). or half breast plate (?). ...... Why do they wear such a dowdy outfit?

The material seems to be made of thin leather from horses or cows, and the steel plate has bumps and dents here and there. The steel plate also has bumps and dents here and there, and looks as thin as paper.

How can he look so comfortable with that kind of equipment?

<blank>

Oh! Hey, old man! What do you want to talk to us about?

<blank>

The guy who came forward, grinning and contorting his face, asked Mr. Roderick in a loud, angry voice.

He has red and blue mesh in his hair and several piercings in his nose and lips as well as in his ears.

On top of his nose, he wore thin, tinted glasses and his chest was wide open, with several jingling gold chains peeking out from it.

It's really flirtatious!

It doesn't look very much like 'people who have been played out of the slums, who have been deprived of food!

A 'thug' if you will.

The angry shouts he made earlier must have been intended to intimidate them to the utmost.

<blank>

Roderick's face seemed to twitch somewhat as if he too had noticed this.

I don't think it was that he was frightened by the angry shouts, but rather that he realized that he was wrong about his prospects.

<blank>

"Gentlemen, would you be so kind as to remove the wagon that is blocking the road? If you are having trouble moving it, we can help you.

"Aaah? What the hell? Oh, yes! It's Nangi! Nangi desu he? Huh?

<blank>

The guy then turns to his friends and starts laughing. The people around him started to laugh in response.

They look soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo stupid! Just from the exchange I just had, I could tell that these guys are thugs of poor quality!

<blank>

If you need anything at all, just let me know. I'll help you in any way I can."

<blank>

Mr. Roderick is not intimidated by these people and is still trying to continue negotiations.

He is more ballsy than I thought he would be.

He wasn't just a well adjusted uncle. I'm starting to rethink him a little.

<blank>

"Need something? Yeah! I need something to get through here! We need to pay the toll, don't we? What? Hey!

If it's just money, I'll pay for it. If it's not enough, go to town and I'll get it for you."

Oh? What are you talking about? I'm not going to let you go into town! I'm gonna pay you here! Here! Aah!

<blank>

Hey! Masuka! These guys are wearing uniforms from Dekenberger's Yamanote school! They must be ex-noble lads!"

If you threaten your parents with money, you can get as much as you want!"

<blank>

Apparently, some of them noticed the uniform Irving was wearing.

But ......, threatening Mr. Harry?

Wow ......, even though it's something you don't know, daredevilry is at its height here ....... Bibi and Mia both look appalled.

<blank>

"Oh? Threatening my parents? That's stupid! I can't keep doing that every time! What a pain in the ass! What's with this kid? He's carrying a big-ass sword! What's the matter with you? You want to do it with that, little boy? Can you pull it off? You can't pull it out? What? Can't you pull it out? Hey!

<blank>

The charlatan called Masuka, probably the leader of the group, is unleashing a loud threat against Irving.

He's kind of restless and noisy.

Irving, by contrast, hasn't moved a single eyebrow, though!

<blank>

"More than that! If you try to pull that sword out, I'll stabb this old man! Ha ha ha!

<blank>

The charlatan taps Mr. Roderick's shoulder in front of him with the belly of the shortsword he is holding.

Mr. Roderick's body tensed up for a moment, but Irving remained motionless with his arms folded.

Because! Because that's where Irving is in between.

<blank>

Irving would be able to move and knock down that guy the moment he tries to hurt Mr. Roderick.

<blank>

"Hey, hey, hey! There's a great guy in the wagon!"

<blank>

At that moment, the rear door of the carriage was violently opened.

The door next to where we were sitting was opened, and one of the hoodlums looked at us with wide, happy eyes and screamed.

<blank>

"Wuh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! That's a real top ball!"

<blank>

The door on the other side was also opened and two more goons peeked in.

The goons took Bibi and Mia by the arm and roughly dragged us off the wagon.

Bibi was pretending to be cute by saying "caw," but wasn't that a little too deliberate?

I gave Bibi a little jit eye and he turned his gaze in the direction of the day after tomorrow.

<blank>

"Oh my gosh, this guy is amazing! This guy is awesome!"

I'm allowed to touch you, right? Let me rub it!"

Hey! Stop it!"

<blank>

The bastards are glued to Mia's chest.

I don't know how you feel, but it's mine! I hope you're ready to be a Buddha! Kwuwa!

<blank>

But still, the weapons these guys have in their hands are really bad!

The knife held by the guy who pulled Mia out of the wagon has a broken blade here and there.

Are you sharpening it properly? Is it sharp enough?

A knife like this can't even scratch the fabric we're wearing underneath, which is made of brown crawler thread.

Well, it is a maiden's secret where she wears it!

<blank>

Don't! Leave them alone!"

<blank>

Mr. Roderick noticed the commotion in the rear and raised his voice toward us.

<blank>

"Oh? Shut up, Dad! Don't you fucking move!

<blank>

When Mr. Roderick suddenly shouted loudly, a thug named Muska grabbed him by the chest and put the blade of his shortsword against his neck, cajoling his strength.

<blank>

Ugh? Ugh!"

Chi! Chairman!

<blank>

Cu Emel, who had also been taken outside and was being restrained from both sides by two hoodlums, saw that Roderick was about to be roughed up, slipped out of their hands that were restraining him and quickly ran forward.

The ripeness of its body is truly that of an animal of the cat family.

<blank>

If anything should happen to them, you will not get away with it! You're not going to get away with this!

<blank>

Not intimidated by the blade against his own neck, Mr. Roderick shouts loudly and angrily at the lawless hoodlums.

Very manly indeed! Yeah! I knew I had to review you, Roderick!

<blank>

Cu Emel runs toward Roderick, but Irving, as if to protect him, holds him back, as if it were too dangerous to go any further.

Hmm? This one is also moving like a manly knight protecting a woman, right?

I could see Bibi's grumpiness quotient go up a giggle for a second. ......

<blank>

"Aaaaahn? Don't tell me what to do! Damn you, old man! You shut the fuck up already! ！！！！"

<blank>

A guy named Masuka grabbed Mr. Roderick by the chest and pulled out a shortsword, trying to stab him in the throat.

Oh, this guy is the kind of scum that has no regard for human life.

He is trying to take Mr. Roderick's life easily just because he doesn't like his attitude toward him or something!

This behavior clearly shows that these people have been taking people's lives with impunity, as if they were plucking flowers.

<blank>

Irving's initial response was delayed a beat by the fact that he had to restrain Mr. Cu Emel. This would not be in time to handle the situation before the blade reached him.

It is inevitable that Mr. Roderick will be hurt, although it will not be life-threatening at this point.

<blank>

But for my part, I have absolutely no intention of allowing Mr. Roderick to get even a hair's breadth of injury.

<blank>

At that moment, a dry burst of sound echoed through the area.

<blank>

That's the sound of a thug called Masuka or whatever he was called, blown to bits.

<blank>

I moved over there in an instant and lightly back-fisted ...... him on the nose, or more accurately, back-decouped him?　I turned my wrist and hit him with the tip of my finger. ......

<blank>

If you're a village kid, you can go to ......, if you're Stefan or Irving, ouch! Ouch!　and they'd just roll around screaming. ......

That's not how it works for people out there!

I feel like AnnaMarie is giving me the stink-eye again.

<blank>

The guy who got blown up seemed to have his face caved in and all his front teeth shattered.

I'm sure I'm going to be in a bad way when I get blown away by trees and rocks. ...... He's alive.

It is in a very bad shape with bends here and there, but it seems to be barely keeping its vital activity.

<blank>

And as if on cue, everyone in Amcam was also taking action.

<blank>

Mia had slammed her twisted fist into the body of the guy who was holding her arm.

The impact pierced through his body, and that one's spine is gone too ......, and the goon who got eaten is twitching and wriggling, with a lump like a liver coming out of his mouth.

<blank>

Bibi is even more egregious.

He slipped into the blind spot of the guy who was holding him down and went for a shower kick to break the guy's medulla oblongata.

The guy who took the bite also fell to the ground, foaming at the mouth and jerking! Pikkum! He is also down on the ground, foaming at the mouth and twitching.

For a moment, his neck must have been at a funny angle. ...... I don't know how he survived that. ......

<blank>

AnnaMarie had slaughtered the other person who had been entangled with Mia and the throat of the other person who had been holding her down with a handheld sword.

Their faces were already purple and twitching as their airways were completely crushed.

<blank>

All three of you are totally going to kill it. ......?

Even if you're underage, AmCam women are really coy. ......

<blank>

In contrast, Irving and Lombardo's counterpart still looks lifeless, although his limbs are pointing in strange directions.

The moment I moved, Irving dove toward the six men on my right side and swung his two-handed sword in a flash or two, knocking down the goons in the blink of an eye.

He jumped straight to the other side of the carriage, and the four people there were struck off in the same instant.

<blank>

Lombardo had escaped from Mr. Cu Emel, and had reared up and blown away the two goons who were trying to chase him down with his buxom arms straight from the front.

<blank>

Without exception, those who were blown away by Irving and Lombardo were slammed into trees, rocks, and other places that would surely track damage if they hit them.

Not a single one of them was able to land gently on the bushes or grass.

So, for the most part, everyone's arms and legs are pointing in funny directions.

This is just as bad, though! Well, I have no sympathy for you!

<blank>

"...... or ...... this, ...... that?"

<blank>

Roderick could not hide his surprise that the situation was under control in the blink of an eye.

<blank>

"So this is ......, this is what you call the power of AMCAM ....... I see. ...... I see!"

<blank>

Roderick, supported by Cu Emel, stood up and nodded his head and said something like that.

Mr. Roderick was a bit apologetic because when I blew up the thug, I got caught up in the momentum and rolled him over.

<blank>

What's going to happen to these guys? I'm going to catch my breath if I don't. ...... Sue! Can't you just fix it?

<blank>

I was about to turn my body toward Mr. Roderick to lend him a hand when Bibi called out to me.

<blank>

What?" I can heal them, but they're all going to make a full recovery at ......, right? I can't do anything dexterous like moderately healing them, can I?"

Aaaaah." I see! ...... is good! It's a pain in the ass, but I'll do it! Mia! You go and restrain them all! ......! What's going on? Sue?

<blank>

He returned to the carriage, retrieved his silver and white sword from under the seat, pulled out one of the swords, spun it around in his hand, and pointed the tip of the sword in a slightly northerly, easterly direction.

<blank>

"......n...... there's one guy on the run, what are you going to do about ......?"

Did someone escape from here?

No, it was a long time ago. We split before these guys blocked the road with their wagon."

<blank>

Yes, they were in my detection range long before Bibi and the others noticed.

I had sensed that one person was away from the group before these guys made a move to block the road.

We were working together until we left, so we're probably buddies. ......

I was wondering if I should keep this one as well.

<blank>

Hmmm! So, what do you think? Can you neutralize and stall them?

"Ummm, I'm about another mile away, so I think ...... I'm going to go easy on you, and you're going to blow up, okay?"

I'm afraid I won't be able to eat hamburgers for a while! I feel like I won't be able to eat hamburgers or anything for a while, so quit it!"

Mm-hmm. Okay.

At any rate, you mean no harm, right?

I'll get you if anything happens, okay? But I've got your attention now, so if anything goes wrong, I can catch you, okay?"

"So be it! Now let's deal with these guys right in front of us!"

<blank>

As it was, Bibi treated only those whose lives seemed to be in danger, and Mia used the ivy she had magically produced to restrain the insect-breathing hoodlums.

After that, Irving and Lombardo would load them up in a wagon and be done with it.
