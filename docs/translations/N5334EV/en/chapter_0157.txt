# Episode 145: Encounter with Arvin Haggard!

"Hey, what brings you here at this hour and in this place?"

<b>

Arvin stepped away from the wall he had been leaning against and cautiously advanced. He then slightly lowered his waist and, without hesitation, unleashed an intimidating presence towards the figure lurking in the shadow of the alley a few meters ahead.

<b>

A tall man clad in a lead-colored robe emerged from the corner of the alley, his hem swaying as if stirred by a slight breeze, revealing his silhouette like a shadow.

However, his face was obscured by a deep lead-colored hood, making it impossible to identify him.

<b>

"Looks like you're not flinching at all."

<b>

Arvin lowered his stance further and placed his hand on his knight sword.

<b>

"This place is off-limits today, you know? Especially for someone trying to sneak in through a back entrance."

<b>

Though the hood concealed his expression, Arvin sensed that the man was grinning widely beneath it.

<b>

Isn't that just great!

<b>

You think showing off your confidence is going to intimidate me?

But there's no denying that this guy is pretty dangerous. I can feel that clearly.

An unpleasant smell is wafting through the air.

That said, there's no way I'm backing down here!

<b>

"I thought I saw a couple of guards around the corner. Have you seen them?"

<b>

Arvin's inquiry was met with an even broader smile from the face hidden beneath the hood, which he sensed with keen awareness. The unpleasant smell intensified.

<b>

Furthermore, Arvin's nose picked up another scent. "Ah, that's definitely the smell of blood," he confirmed, swiftly and quietly drawing his knight sword.

He took a stance, pointing the tip of the sword at the opponent before him.

<b>

His instincts screamed that this was not an opponent he could afford to underestimate.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Yesterday, when I went to report to the consulate, Consul Philip Cloud asked me to provide security for the facility today.

He said it was a precaution for emergencies, and I've been fighting off sleep since early morning to be here.

Until just a moment ago, I was stifling yawns, but now, there's not a trace of drowsiness left.

<b>

I can feel that the person in front of me is not someone I can let my guard down around. Yet, I can't stop the corners of my mouth from lifting.

<b>

Since leaving Amukam, I haven't encountered anyone radiating this kind of lethal intent.

…Of course, Suzy is a different case…

<b>

It's morning, yet this back alley is devoid of sunlight. I can feel the tension in the air tightening around me.

<b>

Suddenly, the air shifted.

Arvin recognized that a sharp thrust had been aimed at his chest.

It was an extraordinary speed.

There was no way an ordinary person could evade it.

In that instant, he understood that the one launching the thrust was no ordinary opponent.

<b>

But!

<b>

The speed and weight of the opponents I usually face are nothing compared to this!

<b>

With a quick flick of his wrist, Arvin deflected the thrust with his knight sword.

The sound of metal clashing echoed, and the opponent instantly leaped backward.

Though his face remained unseen, Arvin could somehow sense the surprise emanating from beneath the hood.

<b>

<b>

"…I see, with that level of dullness, he wouldn't stand a chance."

"What? …What did you say?"

<b>

A mocking murmur slipped from the depths of the hood, but Arvin couldn't quite catch the words.

<b>

However, in the next moment, a metallic sound rang out as he deflected a thrust aimed at him from close range with his left side.

Following the momentum, he swung his knight sword back at the opponent, but the blade only sliced through the air.

Without pause, another thrust came from the opposite side.

Arvin quickly retracted his arm and used the hilt of his knight sword to knock away the incoming attack.

<b>

He repeatedly deflected a series of attacks coming from his blind spots.

At the same time, he aimed to land a fatal blow on the enemy, slashing upward with his knight sword, continuing to swing at high speed.

<b>

The tip of the knight sword occasionally grazed the robe, tearing it, but it was still far from reaching the body beneath.

On the other hand, the enemy's attacks grazed Arvin, tearing his shirt and causing blood to seep from various wounds.

<b>

<b>

Damn it! This gear is like paper!

I feel like this knight sword won't hold up if I put any more strength into it.

With the equipment from Amukam, I could handle someone of this level without any issues. Damn it!

<b>

But I know my brothers could easily scatter someone like this even unarmed.

Shit! I’m not strong enough at all!

<b>

The number of attacks grazing Arvin increased.

He could somehow sense that the man beneath the hood was smirking.

<b>

Damn! This guy thinks he's got the upper hand!

Then, I guess it's time to pull out my trump card!

Hold on! Knight sword!

<b>

Arvin stopped his own attacks and began to focus solely on defending.

Seeing Arvin's movements start to lack their usual sharpness, the hooded man smirked, lifting the corners of his mouth.

<b>

However, while swaying his core to evade attacks, Arvin gathered his "ki" and concentrated it in his chest.

Then, as he deflected yet another attack, he channeled that power into his knight sword and released it all at once.

"Power Slash"!

<b>

One of the initial skills taught to him by Suzy.

<b>

Arvin instantly lowered his stance and unleashed it from a low position.

With speed and weight unlike anything before, the strike infused with "ki" landed.

<b>

"What?!!"

<b>

The hooded man couldn't fully respond to the strike, barely managing to avoid having his weapon severed, and in the next moment, he leaped backward again.

<b>

"This is... surprising."

"Shit! Was that too shallow?"

<b>

Arvin quickly returned to a ready stance, but he also noticed a sense of unease at the tip of his knight sword.

<b>

The two maintained their distance, cautiously circling each other.

But suddenly, the hooded man relaxed his stance, dissipating the lethal intent he had been radiating until now.

<b>

"Hmm, I suppose time's up. It can't be helped."

"What…?"

<b>

Arvin felt puzzled by the man's behavior, but he had no intention of lowering his guard yet.

<b>

"I stopped by to check on her while delivering some goods, but it seems she's not home right now. However, I unexpectedly had a delightful time. It was a good way to pass the time."

"What…? What are you talking about?"

<b>

The man muttered something from beneath his hood, but Arvin couldn't make it out.

The man wasn't addressing Arvin; it was merely a soliloquy.

<b>

"Even without her here, I considered greeting the children inside... But if I were to lay eyes on them here, I wouldn't have the confidence to restrain myself. Heh! Hehehe..."

<b>

Arvin furrowed his brow at the sight of the man seemingly shaking with laughter.

<b>

"…Ah, I can't wait for the day when I can indulge freely, with your permission."

<b>

Leaving behind a small murmur, the wind swirled around the area.

At the same time, the tense atmosphere that had been present began to dissipate gently.

<b>

With the sudden disappearance of the presence around him, Arvin finally lowered his sword.

He then let out a deep breath and leaned his body against the wall behind him.

<b>

"Did he back off? …What the hell was that guy?"

<b>

Still leaning against the wall, Arvin raised the tip of his sword before him.

<b>

"Looks like this won't hold up… damn it."

<b>

The tip of the sword had chipped, and cracks were visible along the blade.

Arvin let his right hand, which was gripping the knight sword, drop limply, while still leaning against the wall, gradually sliding down to sit on the ground.

<b>

"I'm not strong enough at all… damn it."

<b>

Sitting against the wall, he pressed his left hand against his side.

Blood dripped between his fingers, staining his pants.

Blood was oozing from the wound on Arvin's side, where he had been stabbed.

His left hand pressed against it, trying to stem the bleeding.

<b>

"I can already hear Suzy scolding me for lacking concentration..."

<b>

With a sigh, Arvin's body relaxed, and he completely leaned against the wall.

<b>

"…Crap, I'm really sleepy. If I fall asleep here… will Vivi get mad at me?"

<b>

From somewhere far away, he could hear some commotion, but Arvin's consciousness quietly faded, unresponsive to it.

Now, there was no one left here who could respond to the shouts coming from the front of the building.
