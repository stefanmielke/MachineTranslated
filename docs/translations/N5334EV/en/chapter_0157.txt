# 145 Irving Haggard Meets the Enemy!

"Hey, what brings you to this place at this hour?"

<blank>

Irving stepped carefully away from the wall where his back was resting. Then, he lowered his back slightly and, without hesitation, unleashed his intimidation on his opponent, who was lurking in the shadows of an alley a few meters away.

<blank>

A tall man in a lead-colored robe appeared from the corner of the alley, his hem swaying as if caught in a slight breeze, like a shadow.

However, their faces are unrecognizable due to the lead-colored hoods deeply covering their heads.

<blank>

I knew it. You're not even scared.

<blank>

Irving sits back further and puts his hand on his nightsword.

<blank>

This place is off-limits today, okay? Especially not someone trying to get in through the back door like this."

<blank>

The hood was too deep for Irving to see the expression on his face, but he felt it was as if he had a big mouth.

<blank>

That's great!

<blank>

You think you're showing some kind of leeway by laughing at me?

But this guy is definitely in a lot of trouble. I can see that.

A bad smell is wafting through the air.

That said, there's no way I'm going to back out here!

<blank>

There were supposed to be a couple of guards around the corner. Have you seen them?"

<blank>

Irving sensed that the face behind the hood smiled even wider at Irving's question. The unpleasant smell became stronger and louder.

<blank>

Irving's nose also detects a certain smell. He quickly and quietly pulls out his nightsword, convinced that it is mixed with the moving air.

He took up his stance and pointed the tip of his sword at the opponent in front of him.

<blank>

Irving's senses are telling him with all their might that this is not someone he should show any openings to.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I went to report to the consulate yesterday, the consul general, Philip Cloud, asked me to escort him around the facility for the rest of the day.

I was told to be prepared in case of emergency, and here I am early in the morning, sleepy as a clam.

I had been choking back a sigh of relief earlier, but there was not the slightest hint of drowsiness.

<blank>

I know firsthand that the guy in front of me is not someone I should let my guard down. But I can't stop my mouth from going up.

<blank>

I have not seen such a skin-piercing killer since I left AMCAM.

...... of course, Suzy is a different story: ......

<blank>

It's morning and there is no sunlight in the back alley. I can feel the air tense up.

<blank>

Suddenly the air moved.

Irving recognized a sharp thrust aimed at his chest.

It's uncommonly fast.

It's impossible for an ordinary person to avoid it.

A moment later, you realize that the person you are thrusting at is no ordinary being.

<blank>

But!

<blank>

The speed and weight of the opponents I face on a daily basis are nothing compared to this!

<blank>

The nightsword, paid with a quick returned wrist, knocked the thrust away.

A high metallic sound is heard, and the opponent instantly jumps backward.

I still can't see his face, but I can somehow sense his surprise from behind his hood.

<blank>

<blank>

I see."...... Well, this won't be much of a challenge to deal with with that foolishness."

?" What is ......?"

<blank>

A mocking murmur escaped from behind the hood, but Irving couldn't quite make out the words.

<blank>

The next moment, however, a clank! A metallic sound echoed to the left. It was the sound of Irving popping a stab that had been launched at him from close range.

With the flow of the bullet, he switches back to the nightsword and swings it at his opponent, but the blade cuts through the air on the spot.

Without a pause, the next thrust comes from the opposite side.

Irving quickly pulled back the arm he had paid for and struck away at the sole that was closing in on him with the hilt of his nightsword.

<blank>

Irving repeatedly surpasses and beats back a series of attacks launched from a blind spot.

At the same time, he continues to dispel, slash, and swing his nightsword at high speed in order to strike a fatal blow to the enemy.

<blank>

The tip of the nightsword occasionally reaches the robe and cuts through it, but it is still far from reaching the main body.

On the other side, Irving is snatched by an enemy attack, tearing his shirt and smearing blood everywhere.

<blank>

<blank>

Damn it! The equipment is paper!

I have a feeling that this nightsword won't last if I put any more power into it.

With Amcam's equipment, I have a feeling that I can handle a guy of this caliber with no problem. Son of a bitch!

<blank>

But I also know that my brothers can lightly kick the crap out of an opponent like this, even if they are unarmed.

Kusso! It's not strong enough at all!

<blank>

The number of the opponent's attacks that snatch Irving increases.

Somehow, Irving understood that this guy was gloating behind his hood.

<blank>

Shit! This guy thinks he's pushing it!

Then I'll use the one I got for you!

Keep it! Night Sword!

<blank>

Irving stopped trying to strike himself and began to concentrate on being attacked.

The hooded man looks over to see that Irving's movements are beginning to lose their vigor, and he proceeds to fish out the ends of his mouth.

<blank>

However, Irving, who attacks while swaying his torso, kneads Ki to match his movements and gathers it to his chest.

Then, when the attack is over for the second time, the power is transferred to the nightsword and unleashed all at once.

Power Slash."

<blank>

One of the initial skills taught by Suzy.

<blank>

Irving instantly sinks down and shoots it now from a low position.

With a speed and weight that had never been seen before, a strike with "Ki" on it was struck.

<blank>

?

<blank>

The man in the hood was unable to respond to the blow, but barely managed to cut off his weapon, and in the next instant, he jumped backward again.

<blank>

This one, ......, took me by surprise."

Chi! You're shallow!"

<blank>

Irving also returned to his stance to connect immediately to the next step, but he also noticed that the tip of his nightsword had become uneasy.

<blank>

They continued to trade spacing and the two men jiggled their feet.

Suddenly, however, the hooded man released his posture, and the deadly atmosphere he had just been wearing dissipated.

<blank>

I guess we're out of time. It can't be helped.

"......?"

<blank>

Although he questions the man's behavior, Irving has no intention of unpacking his stance yet.

<blank>

I stopped by to check on her for the first time in a while, but she seemed to be out of town. But instead, I had an unexpectedly pleasant time with her. It was a good way to pass the time."

"...... what? What?"

<blank>

The man mutters behind his hood, but Irving cannot hear it.

The man is not speaking to Irving. He is just talking to himself.

<blank>

'Even if she wasn't here, I thought about saying hello to the kids inside ....... But now, once I see them here, I'm not sure I'll be able to discipline myself. Kuhuhuhu! Hmph. ......"

<blank>

Irving raises his eyebrows at the sight of his partner, who seems to be shaking his shoulders and laughing.

<blank>

I can't wait for the time when I will be allowed to ...... and prize them as I see fit."

<blank>

The wind danced on the spot, leaving a small murmur.

At the same time, the tense atmosphere that had existed up to that point gently fizzled out.

<blank>

The sudden disappearance of any sign of life in the area caused Irving to finally lower his sword.

Then he exhaled heavily as he was, and leaned his body against the wall behind him.

<blank>

'They retreated? ...... What was that? That son of a bitch.

<blank>

Leaning against the wall, Irving lifts the tip of his sword to his eye.

<blank>

I knew this wouldn't hold. ......, damn it."

<blank>

The sword was chipped at the cutting edge and cracks were visible on the blade.

Irving then lowers his right hand, which is still holding the nightsword, and goes slouching down, keeping his weight against the wall.

<blank>

"I ain't got all that much power. ...... damn it."

<blank>

He sat down on the ground, leaning against the wall on the spot.

Then, hold the flank with the left hand.

Blood dripped from between his fingers and even stained his pants.

Irving's side is flooded with blood from a stabbed and pierced wound.

His left hand is holding it down, trying to control the bleeding.

<blank>

Susie is going to yell at me for not concentrating enough. ......

<blank>

Suddenly, Irving's strength drained from his body and he completely rested his body against the wall.

<blank>

I'm so sleepy, I can't ...... sleep here. I wonder if Bibi will be ...... mad at me if I sleep here?"

<blank>

Somewhere in the distance, he hears a bustle, but Irving's consciousness falls silent and he does not react to it.

There was no one here who could answer the shouts coming from the front of the building.
