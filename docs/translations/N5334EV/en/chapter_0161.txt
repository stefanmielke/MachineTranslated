# 149 The Blessing of the Devil

The dagger that Lucille just used was made to be carried in the city, with the blade smashed to reduce its killing power.

But it is still a piece of steel.

<blank>

He swung with all his might to strike it into the dove-tail as hard as he could.

If he had been hit with a live hand, it would have been enough to break a finger bone.

<blank>

In fact, Lucille, who was angry with Parker for unleashing his magic on Catherine, swung away with the intention of getting him to be prepared for some of the ribs.

<blank>

But this man is even smiling wanly as if nothing had happened.

Moreover, the dagger in his grasp did not even flinch.

A nasty sweat broke out on Lucille's back.

<blank>

Fluke then lifted Lucille's arm, which she held in her left hand, further and swung the club in her right hand.

Quickly, Lucille removed her hand from the dagger and kicked the ground to get away from the scene.

<blank>

Don't you dare chomp down on me!"

<blank>

Fluke's swing hits her with more velocity than Lucille could have imagined.

Lucille jumped back and protected her head with both arms, but the vicious striking part of the club caught her accurately.

<blank>

!"

<blank>

Lucille's body was hit by a direct blow with her arm, and she was sent flying backward.

Furthermore, the shock of being hit through the guard causes Lucille to skip consciousness.

After being blown away more than five meters, he rolls down the cobblestone pavement, unprotected.

<blank>

"Le, Lucille?

<blank>

Catherine, who rarely expresses her emotions, sounded upset and rushed to Lucille's side as quickly as she could.

<blank>

However, a large dog attacks Catherine.

Cordilia was the first to notice this and quickly released her followers.

<blank>

Sturgeon! Please!!!!"

<blank>

Cordelia instructed her followers to keep the big dog in check and, if possible, to dissuade him. The idea was to use the opportunity to draw them back.

However, the large dog effortlessly catches the swiftly moving small follower with its fangs.

<blank>

Oh! Sturgeon!!!!"

<blank>

Fangs sunk into his body and a high-pitched whine echoed from the large dog's mouth.

Cordelia sees this and screams.

<blank>

But a heavy blow bit into the side of the big dog.

Annie swung her own pochette.

<blank>

Undeterred, the big dog overflows and drops the follower in his mouth.

Without pausing, Annie stepped forward to give chase to the large dog, which jumped back.

Then, to make it a fatal blow, he strikes a vigorous swing between its eyebrows.

<blank>

But the blow was effortlessly caught by the large dog's fangs, and the pochette's belt was easily bitten off.

<blank>

This time Annie quickly jumps back to distance herself from the large dog.

He threw off the belt of the pochette, which remained in his hand, and quickly drew the sword at his waist.

<blank>

Cordelia," he said! Quickly, both of you!

<blank>

Cordilia nodded with tears in her eyes at the sound of Annie's voice, picked up the bloody squire, and she and Catherine dragged Lucille back to the house.

<blank>

Lucille seems to have a concussion and does not regain consciousness when I call to her.

For the moment, there was no significant trauma to the head. But the arms he used to guard them were different. They were already beginning to swell purple, and even an amateur eye like Cordelia's could see that it was bad.

<blank>

The follower, on the other hand, has several fang holes in his body and is bleeding badly and gasping for breath.

<blank>

Oh, ...... Sturgeon, Sturgeon."

"I'm sorry, Mr. Cordelia, I can't ...... go any further."

"...... Oh no!"

<blank>

Catherine, who gives healing to her followers, told them with a sad face that she was only able to keep them alive with her strength, and that she did not know how long she could keep them alive.

<blank>

Annie keeps an ear to the ground for the Cordilleras in the rear while keeping a wary eye on the two and one in the front.

<blank>

Lucille, the only vanguard, is comatose, and Catherine is committed to Sturgeon's treatment. The twins cling to Cordilia.

I am the only one who can move properly now.

<blank>

At least let the twins and Cordelia escape from here.

I don't know how these guys are controlling these big dogs that seem to be magical beasts, but I'll show them how I'm going to deal with this one.

<blank>

The sword I am holding now is not real. I know very well that it is an imitation.

Still, it must be done.

He decided to protect the twins who adore him and help Cordelia.

<blank>

I don't know how far this sword will go against this magical beast.

But Sis Sue also said that there is a way to do it with whatever you get.

Then I'll show you!

I am also a daughter of AMCAM! I can't face my sisters if I'm frightened by this!

Annie is so determined that she stares at the magical beast ahead of her.

<blank>

The magical beast immediately began to move.

Annie leans back slightly, keeping the tip of her sword pointed at the magical beast, and takes a stance.

However, as if seeing through Annie's resolve, the beast leapt aside right in front of her and changed course behind her to avoid her.

<blank>

!"

<blank>

In just a breath, the hexenbiest kicked the ground to jump from Annie's side to the twins.

Caught off guard, Annie turns around in a panic, but the magical beast is already right in front of the twins.

<blank>

But as quickly as she could, Cordilia protected the twins and stood in the path of the magical beast, catching the assault with her own body.

<blank>

Cordelia!

<blank>

Catherine couldn't help but shout.

Cordilia is held down by the magical beast, scratching algae under its large body. But her screams do not rise.

<blank>

"It's ......, it's okay ......!"

"Co-cha!!!"

<blank>

Cordelia's voice came from under the magical beast.

<blank>

While everyone in the room widens their eyes in surprise, Cordelia slowly stands up, holding the head of the magical beast.

<blank>

I have this 'blessing' at .......

<blank>

It's a unique skill called "the blessing of a follower," Cordelia says.

<blank>

It's something that allows you to follow magical beasts under certain conditions. This is why I wanted to become a tamer.

<blank>

Then Cordilia looked at Sturgeon in Catherine's hand and bit her own lip painfully.

<blank>

......My Lady Cordelia, wow."

<blank>

Annie's voice overflowed with admiration.

<blank>

Shit! What the hell? Why won't you listen to me?

<blank>

Fluke, on the other hand, swings his club in his hand abhorrently.

The magic stone at its tip lights up slightly each time the cudgel is swung, but its effect is not apparent.

<blank>

Are you having a heart-to-heart with Mahu?"

It's not such a ...... big deal, Annie."

<blank>

Cordilleras step forward together, holding the head of the hexenbiest. The beast continues to growl low throughout.

<blank>

"We are just forcing them to control their behavior ....... What we are doing is no ...... different than what they are doing."

<blank>

Cordelia continued her words with a bitter scowl on her face.

<blank>

"Even ......, the will of this magical beast is transmitted and comes ....... It is so chaotic and swirling that it cannot be called ...... will, but ......."

<blank>

Sweat beads on Cordelia's forehead as she holds the magical beast by its neck to restrain it.

<blank>

"The ...... demonic beasts, without exception,...... will come to kill against ...... people, but from now on, they will be unstoppable, frightened, angry, and hateful. ......, overflowing ...... with hatred at the mercy of force."

<blank>

"Crap! Why didn't you attack him? You..! You!

<blank>

Fluke swings his cudgel in frustration.

Each time it did, the magic stone attached to the tip of it would flicker and overflow with light.

<blank>

Annie's eyes narrow as she watches.

I wondered if he was controlling this magical beast with that magical tool, after all.

<blank>

What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Your trump card is already in our hands.

<blank>

Beside Annie, Cordilia Casper raised her voice powerfully.
