# Chapter 149: The Protection of the Familiar

The dagger that Lucille just used was designed to be carried in the city, with a dulled blade to reduce its lethality.

However, it was still a solid piece of iron.

<b>

With all her might, she swung it down towards the solar plexus.

If it were to be received by a bare hand, it wouldn't be surprising if a finger bone broke.

<b>

In fact, Lucille was so enraged at Parker, who had cast magic towards Catherine, that she intended to break a few of his ribs with that swing.

<b>

Yet this man wore a faint smile as if nothing had happened.

Moreover, the dagger he had grasped didn’t budge at all.

A cold sweat trickled down Lucille's back.

<b>

Then Fluke lifted Lucille's arm, which he held with his left hand, and raised his club with his right.

In a split second, Lucille released her grip on the dagger and kicked off the ground to distance herself.

<b>

"Stop darting around!!"

<b>

Fluke's swing came at Lucille with a speed beyond her imagination.

As Lucille jumped back, she raised her arms to shield her head, but the brutal striking part of the club accurately caught her.

<b>

"Ah!!"

<b>

Lucille's body was sent flying backward, hit directly by the blow to her arm.

Furthermore, the impact she received through her guard caused her to lose consciousness.

She was blown away more than five meters, rolling helplessly on the cobblestones.

<b>

"Lu, Lucille?!!"

<b>

Catherine, who usually showed little emotion, raised her voice in distress and rushed towards Lucille.

<b>

But a large dog lunged at Catherine.

Noticing this quickly, Cordelia swiftly released her familiar.

<b>

"Sturgeon! Please!!"

<b>

Cordelia instructed her familiar to hold the large dog at bay and, if possible, to confuse it. She thought to pull the two back during that moment.

However, the large dog easily caught the swiftly moving small familiar in its jaws.

<b>

"Ah! Sturgeon!!"

<b>

The fangs sank into its body, and a high-pitched cry echoed from the large dog's mouth.

Seeing this, Cordelia screamed.

<b>

But then, a heavy blow struck the side of the large dog.

Annie had swung her pouch at it.

<b>

Unable to withstand it, the large dog dropped the familiar it had in its mouth.

Without hesitation, Annie stepped forward to pursue the retreating large dog.

And to deliver a fatal blow, she aimed a powerful strike at its forehead.

<b>

However, that strike was easily caught by the large dog's fangs, and the belt of the pouch was easily torn apart.

<b>

Now, Annie quickly jumped back to distance herself from the large dog.

She discarded the remaining belt of the pouch in her hand and swiftly drew the sword hanging at her waist.

<b>

"Cordelia! Quickly, both of you!!"

<b>

Cordelia nodded with tear-filled eyes at Annie's voice, picked up the bloodied familiar, and, along with Catherine, dragged Lucille back.

<b>

Lucille seemed to be suffering from a concussion, not regaining consciousness even when spoken to.

For the time being, there were no visible major injuries to her head. However, her arms, which she had used for defense, were another story. They were already beginning to swell purple, looking terrible even to an amateur like Cordelia.

<b>

On the other hand, the familiar had multiple bite wounds on its body, bleeding profusely and barely hanging on.

<b>

"Ah... Sturgeon, Sturgeon"

"I'm sorry, Lady Cordelia, but I can't do any more than this..."

"…No!"

<b>

Catherine, who was providing healing to the familiar, said with a pained expression that with her abilities, she could only keep it alive for now, and she didn't know how long that would last.

<b>

Annie kept her ears tuned to the situation of Cordelia and the others while being wary of the two and the large dog in front.

<b>

The only frontline fighter, Lucille, had collapsed, and Catherine was focused on healing Sturgeon. The twins were clinging to Cordelia.

Right now, she was the only one who could move properly.

<b>

At the very least, she had to get the twins and Cordelia out of here.

She didn't know how they had managed to control this magical beast, the large dog, but she would take it on herself.

<b>

She knew that the sword she currently held was not real. It was a replica.

Even so, she had to do it.

She had decided to protect the twins who looked up to her and to support Cordelia.

<b>

She didn’t know how effective this sword would be against the magical beast.

But Sister Su had also said that no matter what weapon you had, you could find a way to use it.

Then she would show them!

She was the daughter of Amukam too! If she backed down now, she wouldn't be able to face her sisters!

Annie steeled herself and glared at the magical beast ahead.

<b>

The magical beast moved immediately.

Annie lowered her stance slightly, keeping the tip of her sword aimed at the beast.

However, as if seeing through Annie's resolve, the beast jumped sideways right in front of her, avoiding her and changing its course to move behind her.

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

In a split second, the beast kicked off the ground to leap at the twins from the side.

Caught off guard, Annie hurriedly turned around, but the beast was already in front of the twins.

<b>

However, Cordelia instinctively shielded the twins, standing in the beast's path and taking the charge with her own body.

<b>

"C-Cordelia!!"

<b>

Catherine involuntarily cried out.

Cordelia was pinned down by the beast, struggling beneath its large body. Yet, she did not scream.

<b>

"…I-I'm fine…!"

"“Coo-chan!!”"

<b>

Cordelia called out from beneath the beast.

<b>

As everyone present widened their eyes in shock, Cordelia slowly stood up while holding the beast's neck.

<b>

"I have... this 'protection.'"

<b>

She said it was a unique skill called "Protection of the Familiar."

<b>

"It allows me to control a magical beast under specific conditions. That's why I aimed to become a tamer."

<b>

Saying this, Cordelia glanced at Sturgeon in Catherine's hands and bit her lip in distress.

<b>

"…Lady Cordelia, that's amazing."

<b>

Annie couldn't help but let out a voice of admiration.

<b>

"Damn it! What the hell?! Why won't it listen?!"

<b>

On the other hand, Fluke swung the club he held with irritation.

The magic stone at its tip glimmered faintly every time the club was swung, but its effect was not apparent.

<b>

"Are you communicating with the magical beast?"

"Not at all... It's not something so grand, Annie."

<b>

Cordelia, still holding the beast's neck, stepped forward together. The beast continued to growl lowly.

<b>

"I'm just forcing it to act... That's all. What I'm doing is no different from what they do..."

<b>

Cordelia continued, her face contorted in pain.

<b>

"…But, I can feel the beast's will... It's swirling in chaos... It's not something you could call intention..."

<b>

As she held the beast's neck down, sweat began to bead on Cordelia's forehead.

<b>

"…The beast, without exception... directs its murderous intent towards humans... but now, it is overflowing with unending fear, anger, and hatred... a blind rage..."

<b>

"Damn it! Why isn't it attacking?! This! This!!"

<b>

Fluke swung the club in frustration.

Each time, the magic stone at its tip flickered with light.

<b>

Watching this, Annie narrowed her eyes.

So they were indeed controlling this magical beast with that magical tool.

<b>

"Now! What are you planning to do? Your trump card is already in our hands, you know?!"

<b>

Cordelia Casper raised her voice strongly beside Annie.
