It's been quite a while since I started, so my body is getting pretty good.

"Really? Come to think of it, I've been doing this for about two years now."

Even in casual, everyday movements, your performance has improved considerably. It's easy on the body, isn't it?"

I'm not afraid of walking anymore," he said. It's like I'm a teenager again.

Well, my goal is to have the resilience of a five-year-old, so I'm not there yet."

What's that?"

But your current body is already in the realm of a master.

What?" Really? I don't feel stronger at all?"

I don't think you can get stronger if you haven't trained to get stronger! It means that the base has been established. From there, you can train in different specialties. If it is baseball, it is baseball. If it is tennis, it is tennis. If it is martial arts, you have a base to become a martial arts expert. And that means you have entered a neutral state to become a master.

Really?" What's that? Then should I do something? Aiki or iai?"

I think you should do it if you want to. Do you want to do some kind of martial arts?"

I wish I had something that would make me feel better."

Well, why don't you wait until you have something you want to do? Besides, I think it's possible to become an expert in everyday life.

The most beautiful thing is to live a simple, everyday life. To live one day at a time is what life is all about.

You sound like an old man."

I'm already an old man.

Yes, the mind changes along with the body.

What is it? Are you trying to tell me that I stink of old age, both physically and mentally?"

No, I mean, your body is performing better, so you should start to feel more relaxed mentally as well.

"Really? I don't know how to have a heart. Is there even room for it?"

Well, then, let's think of the state of mind in terms of water.

Water?

It is water. It is a container of water. If you have a small or narrow mind, it is only as big as a cup or basin. If it is somewhat larger, it may be the size of a bathtub or a pond, but it is still not big at all. ...... If the water surface is shaken or the wind blows, the surface of the water will soon rise to the surface and a cup or washbowl will quickly spill out. If you throw a stone the size of your fist into the water, the cup will break and the basin will almost completely overflow, won't it? Even a bathtub would overflow if it were a stone the size of your hand, and even a pond would have trouble with waves. A swimming pool, however, would not overflow.

You're talking about wind and stones and all that stuff about outside stimuli and attacks?"

'Yes, it's the external influences on the mind.'

If you keep taking those kinds of psychological attacks, they get tougher and tougher, and they become less effective, don't they? You know, there are fences and walls and things like that, right?"

It's just a paralyzed mind," he said. If you put up a fence or a wall, it will repel everything except attacks. As I think I have said before, pain is an important piece of information. Strength is the ability to accept and endure it. Not feeling pain is not strength. However, I am not saying that you should accept a shock that you can't handle. The important thing is to create a nurturing environment that can take it. Even if a rock like a car or a dump truck jumps into the water, if it is a deep lake, the surface will calm down immediately. There will be no waves on the other side of the shore. Even if a stormy wind blows, if the lake is as wide as the ocean, the surface may be rough in one place, but in another place there will be a calm surface with not a single wave. Even with a slight wind, small waves may appear, but the surface of the water will soon regain its mirror-like appearance. That is the ultimate goal.

Oh! That's what you call a clear and bright light!"

As our physical abilities change, so too does the depths of our hearts. Even if you don't notice it on the surface, the depth and breadth of your mind will gradually change, as well as your way of being.

May I? Mind and body are one thing. Don't forget that."

<blank>

<blank>

"...... another dream or ......"

<blank>

I woke up and there was a strange ceiling...was that the prologue to something?

<blank>

The ceiling is high and white.

A wooden frame about one meter square was set in a grid pattern across the ceiling.

The latticework was intricately decorated with circular, plant motif designs that added a touch of luxury.

The wooden frame of the latticework is also massive and finely carved in relief, and just by looking at the ceiling, one can see the prestige of this room.

<blank>

Now he is in bed, looking up at the ceiling.

The beds are softly wrapped around the body and covered with clean covers and sheets.

<blank>

(This is the first time I've slept in a bed since I came here... If it feels this good, I'm sure I'll be fast asleep. Last night I went to ...... and fell asleep in the middle of dinner. But still, how can I say ...... I'm becoming a toddler here, aren't I? (Myself!)

<blank>

<blank>

Yesterday, I couldn't stop crying, and a panicked Howard held me up and took me home.

<blank>

When Suzy told Howard that she was moved by the sunset, Howard was distraught, and Sonia remonstrated with him, saying that sometimes girls do things like that.

<blank>

After dinner, Suzy was again sobbing with tears of joy at the delicious taste of deer steaks and deer tongue stew, and fell asleep.

<blank>

(I feel like the two of you are always looking at my embarrassing tokos. Just remembering it makes me feel ashamed. ......)

<blank>

Outside, the sun has not yet risen, but the sky is beginning to turn white.

<blank>

Thinking back, I got out of bed thinking, "Since I came here, I've been living a very natural lifestyle, going to bed after the sun goes down and getting up when the sun comes up. ......

<blank>

It seems he was made to change into his nightgown before being put into bed.

Is it a light blue cotton weave? Light and pleasant to the touch.

<blank>

(He falls asleep while eating, is made to change into his nightgown, and is carried to bed. ...... I'm really serious, I'm a toddler. ......)

<blank>

He turns over and thinks to himself, his cheeks twitching a little.

<blank>

On the wall in front of him was a small desk with a view of his appearance propped up next to it.

On the desk, a change of clothes is neatly folded and placed.

<blank>

The figure is carved with a lovely relief in a pink-dyed wooden frame.

There is even a ribbon carved into the top, which doesn't really fit the furnishings of the room.

<blank>

I am sure Elrose was thoughtful enough to leave it there for me to change clothes? I guess so.

<blank>

She took off her nightgown and stood in front of the mirror in just a pair of shorts.

<blank>

"Hmmm, this is the first time I've seen it in a mirror properly ......, after all, this body is ...... erotic to say I'm 13 years old."

<blank>

I guess it's not surprising that she's 153 tall, even though she's about 20 years old,....... The first time I saw her, she was a little nervous, but she was not.

<blank>

<blank>

She has a narrow neck, small shoulders, and a well-shaped, bowl-shaped bust that is not small at all! The breasts are well shaped and bowl-shaped.

The tight, narrow waist, slightly long and narrow belly button.

Small but cute, three-dimensional buttocks that protrude slightly posteriorly.

The line that extends from the thin ankle to the calf, curving inward and going up from the knee to the inner thigh, is very erotic and lovely.

<blank>

Duh! Cute and sexy, good style!

<blank>

<blank>

Her hair, when you look at it properly like this... it's beautiful. I'd say it's red. ......, it looks like rubies when the light shines through it."

<blank>

Move your head left and right, shake your hair and watch.

Hair that bounced outward sprinkled red light.

The beautiful angel ring further enhances its crimson color.

<blank>

Her face is also ...... so well arranged that she looks like a doll. Even though ......, I do wonder if she looks a bit young. I'm not sure if it's possible to say that she looks like a little girl. But, yes! She's a beautiful woman with rounded eyes! ......So beautiful, Susie. ............

<blank>

I put my hand on the mirror and say with a determined look on my face.

<blank>

"N! ...... Well."

<blank>

With a slight tinge in his cheeks, he coughed lightly and took a step down.

He was slightly embarrassed.

<blank>

<blank>

Face the mirror again, legs shoulder-width apart with inner thighs, hips lightly thrust to the left, right shoulder up and left shoulder down.

The right arm should be extended down along the body, palm facing backward and fingers open in a warped manner.

Left arm closed at the side, bent under the chest, hand in front of the face, back of the hand facing forward, fingers open, index finger aligned with the bridge of the nose, looking straight ahead.

<blank>

The fragrant pose is complete.

<blank>

It is the so-called level 1 joho stand.

<blank>

<blank>

Staring in the mirror while in that pose. ......

<blank>

"...... since when did you realize this wasn't a dream!"

<blank>

He turned to the mirror and asked the question.

<blank>

Baa-baaaan!" and the letters drawn on his back are also carried on his back.

<blank>

<blank>

Tot-tot-tot, he backed up to the bed and fell straight onto his back.

<blank>

"It's been a long time ago~~~......"

<blank>

It shriveled up like a pshrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr~~~...... and the air went out.

<blank>

"After all, when you come in contact with another person, you realize you're not dreaming... ......"

<blank>

He rolled over and slumped over and began to moan.

<blank>

How am I supposed to handle something like this? With a female video game character? Cutting down mountain ranges with unbelievable power? Fighting against monsters? Is this okay? Is it okay to be human? Can I stay here? Am I allowed to live?

<blank>

Unnhhhhh～～～～ and flapping his arms and legs on the bed.

<blank>

But now, this is alive. I want to live as long as I'm alive. Howard is kind and Sonia's food is delicious. Good food is justice! Good food pleases the body. The body craves delicious food and life! Then think about living! Live properly!

<blank>

I know it's kind of obvious, but think .......

<blank>

But people have to convince themselves first, no matter how cryptic they may be, you know?

<blank>

It's so annoying~~ ....... Phewhhhhh, I rolled over again, turned onto my back and exhaled grandly.

<blank>

<blank>

*****◇*****◇*****◇*****

<blank>

<blank>

So if this is not a dream, what is it?

<blank>

In the game? In the game? No, that's exactly what I don't have.

If you had said you were playing a VRMMO, a virtual experience game like the ones in anime and novels, I might still have seen such a possibility, but what I was playing was a regular PC MMO.

It would be absurd and impossible to say that we have suddenly come to a real and virtual game world!

It is still more convincing to be told that it is a dream.

I guess there is no such thing as being in a different game.

<blank>

The game elements are generally thin, aren't they?

Well, sure, I can use my skills and I have an inventory at ......, but I don't get a window or anything, and I don't know what my status is.

The upper and lower limits of ability can change depending on how much Ki or power is put in. ......

I don't suppose you have any numerical data on their abilities? I'm not sure.

<blank>

After all, is it a good idea to transfer to another world like some skeletal Guilmouth or a programmer who was summoned while taking a nap, like a novel?

In fact, I was falling asleep myself and ............ probably.

Oh, and did I mention that the players are all characters and go to another world?

<blank>

Either way, I'm now in ...... an unknown world, with no friends or acquaintances, and thrown out alone in the form of a play character, a novel-like otherworldly transition .......

Is that FA?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

So, if you are going to live in such a different world, there are a few things you need to think about. ......

<blank>

The first absolutely critical case is ....... How do we live? In other words, how do we live? It is.

<blank>

When I say I have money, it's game currency.

I don't think that one can be used as it is.

It looks like a gold coin, but I don't know the value of gold here.

Is it really money in general? If they say it's money for a toy or something, you can't even look at it.

<blank>

You could sell your belongings for money, but you should refrain from selling weapons and armor because they seem to come with all sorts of dangers.

<blank>

Would you be okay with something bland like fur or a jar?

The main problem is that I don't know where to sell them. ......

<blank>

Objectively speaking, I am now an out-of-town kid who doesn't speak the language well and doesn't know the world.

The right choice for a child suddenly thrown out in the middle of nowhere, with no one he or she knows, is to take .......

<blank>

Rely on trusted adults! This is the only way.

<blank>

<blank>

In modern Japan, we should be able to rely on the police force, but I don't know if there is one here.

<blank>

There is an order of knights, and I have heard glimpses of a similar organization, but they don't seem to be in this village.

<blank>

But fortunately, from what I saw in the temple, Mr. Cloud seems to have a certain status and trust in this village, so it is right to consult with him.

<blank>

We can't stay here forever, can we?

If we do well, we may be able to get them a place to live or a job.

<blank>

Oooh, I think we can expect that much.

I'll get him to talk to you earlier today when he has time!

<blank>

As for the living infrastructure, I'd start with that and then go to .......

<blank>

<blank>

...So.

There are some things we need to know. The first of these is the issue of bravery.

<blank>

That and otherworldly transplants.

<blank>

I only know from what I heard from Henry at the Temple. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Two hundred years ago, a person from another world with great power appeared in this world.

He saved this country from something 200 years ago, brought the country together and laid the foundation for the modern era.

<blank>

I seem to ...... think it's something. ...... something.

This brave man was a ...... contemporary, wasn't he?

<blank>

No, I think the evidence is thin, but ...... what can I say, the progress of civilization in this world is ...... something of a chink in the armor.

<blank>

The only transportation was horse-drawn carriages, and apparently no internal combustion engines existed.

<blank>

I think it's about 18th-19th century as far as lifestyle is concerned. ......

In our world, the Industrial Revolution would have occurred, steam engines would have been developed, and trains would have been running, but apparently that is not the case.

<blank>

There is no lifeline.

There was no running water, it was a well, and in the kitchen they used a rowing pump to get water out.

Naturally, there is no electricity or gas. The ovens are wood-fired, and the lights are lamps and candles.

Even so, you can even use the shower in a warm bath.

There was even a cordless hair dryer.

<blank>

What surprised me was the washlet! Why is there one?

<blank>

I was so surprised! I was suddenly pushed up by the warm water!

This is a very serious situation from a maiden's point of view! I made a weird noise and Elrose was surprised and laughed at me! I made a strange voice and Elrose was surprised and laughed at me. ......

Aah! I'm getting embarrassed just remembering it!

<blank>

Absolutely ridiculous! It's crazy to think that the standard of living is on par with modern times when there is not even a foundation of infrastructure! It looks like they just inserted some technology or knowledge from the side.

What the hell did you do? Brave man!

<blank>

<blank>

There may or may not have been other watchers besides the brave men and their attendants. ......

Well, I have no idea about this area at this stage.

<blank>

But if they were there, I don't think it's wrong to track their whereabouts.

<blank>

Where did the brave men come from, what did they do and where did they go?

Is this the place to start looking?

If they were able to return to where they came from. ...... if they had the means to return.

<blank>

I have to go home too. ......... what? From ...... where? ...... where? ...... where? .......

<blank>

Let's not, it's a coy thought.

Well, "Chasing the Legend of the Brave" is a definite.

<blank>

<blank>

Another matter of the greatest concern.

Was the brave man a game player?

If the brave ones are, so are their attendants?

Were there others?

Are you still there?

Will there be more to come?

<blank>

<blank>

I'm a small fry player in the game, though I came to this world and became a warrioress.

I am confident that if a high level player were there, he would be killed instantly.

When the PKer comes, there is not a single pool.

<blank>

<blank>

If by now, those who have crossed over to this world ...... who are to come were high level, I would be a small fry commoner.

It is quite possible that the brave man was a high level player.

<blank>

At least I don't think of myself as a brave man.

I'm aware of the common people.

<blank>

What would you do if you were born a man and you didn't want to be a man? I know there are some people who think like ......, but I don't.

I'm the type of person who thinks, "Please do your best in a place that has nothing to do with me. ......

<blank>

It is impossible for me to take care of the majority of people other than myself!

At best, they will be busy taking care of their family, friends, relatives, and others around them!

I'm a team leader with a few people!

<blank>

<blank>

I have to be careful and alert in advance to avoid mistakes, but when mistakes occur, I follow up with them, listen to their complaints, comfort them, and scold them. When the boss told me that it was impossible to adjust the schedule, I would say, "That's impossible! I would say, "That's impossible! Even with the team's help, I managed to make it on time, but they looked at me like I deserved it! But I couldn't say anything. Still, the drinks at the party were delicious, and I was glad to be a part of this team. ......

<blank>

I am such a commoner!

<blank>

<blank>

Mr. President? It's hard work, isn't it? You're responsible for the lives of so many people, so please do your best!

I can't do it! Just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach!

Dream big? Under the sun? I don't know! You can look at it on your own!

I don't want to smoke brandy and watch the night view from a high floor of the Hills.

I like to be on the ground! I like to drink hoppy drinks while eating yakitori at a keg table at a standing bar in Noge!

<blank>

Oh! I want to eat shirokoro!

<blank>

<blank>

...... Oops, my bad. That was some personal bitching. ...... Well, in short, I wanted to strongly assert that I am a commoner from the bottom up! I wanted to strongly insist that I am a commoner from the bottom of my heart.

<blank>

You'll have to be prepared for a lot of things. ......

<blank>

To be honest, I wonder if an irregular being like myself is allowed to be in this world. I also think about it. ......

Therefore, they should not act in a conspicuous manner.

If this is true, perhaps they should just hunker down somewhere.

If you can't do that, at least build a modest life as a commoner.

<blank>

Yes, let's try to integrate ourselves into this world as common people.

<blank>

If there are high-level players, it could be an END at that point if you stand out badly and are noticed by them.

Bright commoners who are rooted in the community without being conspicuous or showing off! That's what we are aiming for!

<blank>

Know thyself, and seek to live within your means, without being extravagant!

<blank>

<blank>

*****◇*****◇*****◇*****

<blank>

<blank>

"...... know thyself and ......?"

<blank>

He rolls over on his back on the bed and mutters to himself as he looks at his right hand raised above him.

<blank>

You can find it at .......

<blank>

Keep your right hand raised and clench your fist. ......

<blank>

A beautiful girl in body, but an old man in brain! The brain is an old man!

<blank>

<blank>

With a slap, he drops his hand forcefully onto his forehead and .......

<blank>

'If ......, then what's in your heart? What's ...... the heart ......?"

<blank>

There is no one anywhere to answer that question.
