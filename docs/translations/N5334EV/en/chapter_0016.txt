"It's been quite a while since we started, and your body has really come together."

"Is that so? Now that you mention it, it's been about two years."

"Even in the most mundane daily movements, your performance has significantly improved. Your body must feel great, right?"

"Yeah, walking has become completely fine. I can recover from fatigue just by sleeping, it feels like I've gone back to my teenage years."

"Well, the goal is to achieve the recovery ability of a five-year-old, so there's still a long way to go."

"What the heck does that mean!?"

"But your current physical state has already reached the level of a master."

"Huh? Really? I don't feel any stronger at all."

"You can't expect to get stronger without training to become stronger! What you've built is a foundation. From there, by doing specialized training in each area, like baseball, tennis, or martial arts, you've created a base to reach mastery. It means you're entering a neutral state towards becoming a master."

"Is that so? Then should I do something? Like Aikido or Iaido?"

"If you want to try it, I think you should! Do you want to do something martial arts-related?"

"Well, not particularly... I just wish something would catch my interest."

"Well, it's fine to wait until you find something you want to do. Also, becoming a master in daily life is also an option."

"The mundane daily life is the ultimate. Living each day with care is what life is all about."

"That sounds quite old-fashioned."

"Well, I'm already in the old man territory."

"That's right, the state of your body will also change the state of your mind."

"What are you saying? Are you implying that both my body and mind are old-fashioned?"

"Not at all, it's just that as your physical performance improves, your mind should naturally start to feel more relaxed."

"Is that so? I don't really understand what the state of my mind is... Do I even have any relaxation?"

"Well then, let's think of the state of your mind as water."

"Water?"

"Yes, water. A container of water. People with a narrow or small mind only have the size of a cup or a basin. If it's a bit wider, it might be a bathtub or a pond, but it's still quite small. If there's a shake or a gust of wind, the water surface will ripple, and in a cup or basin, it will spill out in no time. If you throw a fist-sized stone into a cup, it will break, and even in a basin, it will almost overflow, right? If it's a stone you have to hold, it would overflow even in a bathtub, and a pond would be disturbed. A pool might manage not to overflow, though."

"Are those winds and stones referring to external stimuli or attacks?"

"That's right, it's the influence your mind receives from the outside."

"Don't you think that if you keep receiving those kinds of mental attacks, you gradually become tougher and they stop affecting you? Like building walls or fences for protection?"

"That's just your mind becoming numb. If you build walls or fences, you'll end up blocking out more than just attacks. As I mentioned before, pain is important information. The strength lies in accepting it and being able to endure it. Not feeling pain is not the same as being strong. That said, I won't tell you to endure impacts you can't handle. The key is to develop the ability to withstand them. Even if a rock the size of a car or a dump truck comes flying in, if it's a deep lake, the water surface will eventually settle down. On the opposite shore, there won't be any waves. Even if a storm-like wind blows, if it's as wide as the sea, the water surface in that spot may be rough, but in another place, there will be a calm surface without a single wave. Even a gentle breeze will create small waves, but it will quickly regain a mirror-like surface. That's the ultimate goal."

"Oh! That's the state of 'clear mirror and still water,' isn't it!?"

"When physical abilities change, changes will also come to the depths of your mind accordingly. Even if you don't notice it on the surface, the depth, breadth, or even the state of your mind will gradually change.

Do you understand? The mind and body are one. Don't forget that."

<b>

"......Another dream..."

<b>

When I woke up, there was an unfamiliar ceiling above me... Wasn't that part of some prologue?

<b>

The ceiling is high and white.

A wooden frame is arranged in a grid pattern, about one meter square, across the entire ceiling.

Within that grid, a complex design featuring circular plant motifs is intricately drawn, creating a sense of luxury.

The wooden frame of the grid is also heavy and finely carved, and just looking at this ceiling gives an impression of the room's high status.

<b>

Right now, I'm lying in bed, looking up at the ceiling.

The bed is soft and envelops my body, covered with a clean cover and sheets.

<b>

(It's the first time I've slept in a bed since coming here... With how comfortable this is, it's no wonder I slept so soundly. Last night... Oh right, I fell asleep during dinner. But still, how should I put it... Am I becoming more childlike since coming here? Myself!)

<b>

<b>

Yesterday, I was taken home by a flustered Howard while I was still crying.

When Suzy expressed her amazement at the sunset, Sonia, slightly exasperated with Howard's panic, said, "Girls can have those moments too," in a reprimanding tone.

<b>

Later at dinner, Suzy again filled her stomach with delicious dishes like deer steak and deer tongue stew, while shedding tears of joy, and apparently fell asleep.

<b>

(I feel like I've been seen in nothing but embarrassing moments by those two. Just recalling it makes me feel ashamed...)

<b>

It's still dark outside, but the sky is starting to brighten.

<b>

Thinking back, since coming here, I've been going to bed after sunset and waking up at sunrise, leading to a rather natural lifestyle... I thought as I got out of bed.

<b>

It seems I was changed into sleepwear before being put to bed.

Is this a light sky-blue cotton fabric? It's light and feels good against the skin.

<b>

(Falling asleep during a meal, being changed into sleepwear, and carried to bed... This is seriously like being a toddler...)

<b>

I looked down, self-deprecatingly, and my cheeks twitched slightly.

<b>

In front of me, a small desk was placed, and next to it, a full-length mirror was propped up.

On the desk, neatly folded clothes were placed.

<b>

The mirror has a pink wooden frame with cute relief carvings.

At the top, there's even a carved ribbon, which doesn't quite match the decor of this room.

<b>

I guessed that Elrose-san had thoughtfully placed it there for when she needed to change.

<b>

I discarded my sleepwear and stood in front of the mirror in just my underwear.

<b>

"Hmm, this is the first time I'm really looking in the mirror... This body, to say it's 13 years old... is quite... sexy, isn't it?"

<b>

Being 153 cm tall is not unusual for someone around twenty... I thought as I touched various parts of my body... my chest, waist, and hips... and my thoughts slipped out.

<b>

<b>

A slender neck, small shoulders, and a beautifully shaped bust that is definitely not small! 

A slim waist that looks like it could snap, with a slightly elongated and small navel.

A small but slightly protruding, three-dimensional, and cute bottom.

The line that expands from my thin ankles to my calves, curving inward and rising from my knees to my inner thighs, creates a very sexy and cute leg line.

<b>

Yep! What a cute and sexy figure!

<b>

<b>

"My hair, when I look at it properly... is beautiful. It's red, or rather... when light passes through it, it looks like ruby."

<b>

I moved my head left and right, shaking my hair.

The hair that bounced outward scattered a red light.

A beautiful halo enhances that red color even more.

<b>

"My face... is so well-proportioned, it looks just like a doll. ...But, there is definitely some childishness, isn't there? If I say 'middle schooler,' it might not be entirely wrong? But, yep! I've got big, beautiful eyes! ...I'm pretty, Suzy..."

<b>

I placed my hand on the mirror and said with a determined expression.

<b>

"Okay! ...Now then."

<b>

With slightly flushed cheeks, I cleared my throat lightly and took a step back.

I seemed to have become a bit embarrassed.

<b>

<b>

Facing the mirror again, I opened my legs shoulder-width apart and slightly thrust my hips to the left, raising my right shoulder and lowering my left shoulder.

My right arm extended down along my body, palm facing backward, fingers spread apart.

My left arm was bent at the elbow, closed against my side, with my hand in front of my face, palm facing forward, fingers spread, with my index finger aligned with my nose, gazing straight ahead.

<b>

The pose is complete.

<b>

It's the so-called Level 1 JoJo pose.

<b>

<b>

Staring at the mirror in that pose...

<b>

"......When did I realize this wasn't a dream!?"

<b>

I hurled the question at the mirror.

<b>

『BANG!』 The words were emblazoned on my back.

<b>

I took a few steps back to the bed and fell back onto it.

<b>

"It's been quite a while now..."

<b>

With a sound like air escaping, I deflated.

<b>

"Once I make contact with someone else, I realize it's not a dream..."

<b>

I rolled over onto my stomach and began to groan.

<b>

"What am I supposed to do with this? As a female character in a game? Am I supposed to carve mountains with impossible powers? Or dominate monsters? Is this okay? Is it alright to be human? Can I stay here? Is it okay to live?"

<b>

Ughhhhhh~~ I flailed my arms and legs on the bed.

<b>

"But right now, this is living. As long as I'm alive, I want to keep living. Howard is kind, and Sonia's cooking is delicious. Delicious is justice! Delicious makes my body happy. My body craves deliciousness and life! Then I will think about living! I will live properly!!"

<b>

It's something so obvious, yet... I thought.

<b>

"But even so, as a human, I have to convince myself first, no matter how unreasonable it may be."

<b>

It's troublesome, isn't it... I rolled over once more and lay on my back, exhaling dramatically.

<b>

<b>

*****◇*****◇*****

<b>

So, if this is not a dream, then what is it?

<b>

Is it a game? Am I inside a game? No, that can't be it.

Is it a VRMMO like those in anime or light novels? If I were playing a virtual reality game, I might feel some possibility, but what I was playing was a regular PC MMO.

Suddenly being thrown into a real, virtual game world is just absurd and impossible!

Saying it's a dream is still more convincing.

The idea of being in a different game is definitely out of the question.

<b>

In general, the game-like elements are quite thin, right?

Sure, I can use skills and have an inventory... but there are no windows popping up, and I can't see any stats.

The limits of my abilities can change based on how I put in my "ki" or "power"...

I can't help but think there are no numerical data for abilities.

<b>

Is it more like a light novel scenario where some skeleton guild master or a programmer summoned during a nap is involved in this world transfer?

In reality, I did fall asleep... probably.

Oh, there was also a story about players being transported as characters to another world, right?

<b>

Either way... being thrown into an unknown world without any companions or acquaintances, in the form of a player character, is a light novel-like world transfer... that's the current situation.

So, that's probably the conclusion, right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

If I'm going to live in such a different world, there are a few things I need to consider...

<b>

The absolutely critical issue is... how to live? In other words, how to sustain myself?

<b>

Even if I have money, it's game currency.

I can't imagine that it can be used as it is.

It looks like gold coins, but I have no idea what the value of gold is here.

Is it really gold? If someone said it's toy money, that would be a disaster.

<b>

Selling my belongings for money is an option, but weapons and armor seem to come with various dangers, so it might be better to avoid that.

<b>

Furs or pots might be safe enough, but the biggest problem is... I have no idea where to sell them...

<b>

Objectively speaking, I am a foreign child who can't speak well and knows nothing about the world.

The correct choice for a child suddenly thrown into an unknown place without any acquaintances is...

<b>

To rely on a trustworthy adult! That's the only option.

<b>

In modern Japan, I would rely on the police, but I have no idea if they exist here.

<b>

I heard that there is a knight order that seems to be a similar organization, but it doesn't seem to be in this village.

<b>

However, fortunately, from what I saw at the temple, Cloud seems to hold a certain position and trust in this village, so consulting with Cloud is the right move.

<b>

I can't stay here forever, after all.

If things go well, I might be able to get help finding a place to live or a job.

<b>

Yeah, that seems like a reasonable expectation.

I should talk to him as soon as possible if I have time today!

<b>

As for establishing a living foundation, that should come first...

<b>

<b>

...And then.

There are things I need to know. The most important of which is the hero issue.

<b>

And the issue of world travelers.

<b>

I only know what I heard from Henry at the temple...

<b>

<b>

Two hundred years ago, a powerful being from another world appeared in this world.

Two hundred years ago, they saved this country from something, united the nation, and laid the foundation for the present.

<b>

That's what I've heard, but... I can't help but feel... just a hunch.

This hero... might have been a modern person, right?

<b>

I know the reasoning is weak, but... somehow, the level of civilization in this world feels... a bit disjointed.

<b>

The only means of transportation seems to be horse-drawn carriages, and it appears that internal combustion engines don't exist.

<b>

From what I can see of the lifestyle, it seems to be around the 18th to 19th century...

In our world, that would be the time of the industrial revolution, when steam engines were developed and trains were running, but it seems that doesn't exist here.

<b>

There are no lifelines either.

There are no water pipes, just wells, and in the kitchen, water is drawn with a hand pump.

Of course, there is no electricity or gas. Ovens are wood-fired, and lighting is provided by lamps and candles.

Yet, somehow, there are warm baths and even showers.

There are even hair dryers without cords.

<b>

What surprised me was the washlet! Why is that here!?

<b>

I was so shocked! Suddenly being hit with warm water was a big deal!

For a girl, this is a serious situation, right!? Ughhh! I made a strange sound and Elrose-san was surprised and laughed at me...

Ah! Just recalling it makes me feel embarrassed!

<b>

This is definitely strange! How can the standard of living be on par with modern times without even the foundation of infrastructure? It looks like some technology or knowledge was inserted from the side.

What did you do!? Hero!

<b>

<b>

There may have been other world travelers besides the hero and their companions, or there may not have been...

Well, I have no idea about that at this stage.

<b>

But if there were, I don't think it's wrong to pursue their whereabouts.

<b>

Where did the heroes come from, what did they do, and where did they go?

That's probably the first thing to investigate.

If they were able to return to their original place... if there is a means to return.

<b>

Can I also return... what is... where from? ...Where is it? ...Where to? ...What...?

<b>

Let's stop, these thoughts are getting scary.

Well, "pursuing the hero legend" is a confirmed matter.

<b>

<b>

Another major concern.

Was the hero a game player?

If the hero was, were their companions as well?

Were there others besides them?

Are there still others now?

Will more come in the future?

<b>

<b>

So far, I've come to this world and been invincible, but in the game, I was a weak player.

If there are high-level players, I have no confidence that I wouldn't be instantly killed.

If a PKer comes, I wouldn't stand a chance.

<b>

If there have been people who have crossed over to this world... if high-level players come in the future, I would be just a weak commoner.

It's entirely plausible that the hero was a high-level player.

<b>

At the very least, I have no intention of becoming a hero.

I have the awareness of being a commoner.

<b>

Some people might think, "If you're born a man, why not aim for the world?" but that's not how I think.

I’m the type who thinks, "Please do your best in places unrelated to me."

<b>

I can't take care of the majority of people other than myself!

I can barely manage to take care of family, friends, and those around me!

I'm just a team leader for a few people!!

<b>

<b>

While being cautious and alert to avoid mistakes, if mistakes happen, I support them, listen to their complaints, comfort them, and scold them. When upper management gives unreasonable scheduling demands, I say, "That's impossible!!" and they say the same. Even if I somehow manage to meet the team's needs, it’s received as if it’s expected, and I want to say, "At least give me some praise!" but I can't.

Yet, the drinks at the celebration are delicious, and I can't help but think how glad I am to be on this team...

<b>

That's the kind of commoner I am!!

<b>

<b>

The boss? That's tough, right? You're carrying the responsibility for many lives, so do your best!

I can't do that! Just thinking about it gives me a stomach ache!

Dream big? The world? I don't know!! Just keep dreaming!!!

I don't even want to look at the night view from a high floor in Hills while sipping brandy.

I love the ground! Eating yakitori at a standing bar in Noge while drinking hoppy is the best!!

<b>

Ah! I want to eat shirokoro!!!

<b>

<b>

...Oops, my apologies. I let out some personal gripes there... Well, in short, I wanted to strongly assert that I am fundamentally a commoner!

<b>

There are various things I need to prepare for...

<b>

Honestly, I wonder if it's okay for an irregular existence like mine to be in this world?

That's why I shouldn't take actions that stand out.

Ideally, I should probably hide away somewhere quietly.

If I can't do that, then at least I should strive to build a modest life as a commoner.

<b>

Yes, I will make an effort to blend into this world as a commoner.

<b>

If there are high-level players, standing out and attracting their attention could lead to an end for me.

I aim to be a bright commoner rooted in the community without standing out!

<b>

Know yourself, avoid arrogance, and seek a lifestyle that suits your means!

<b>

<b>

*****◇*****◇*****

<b>

"......Know thyself..."

<b>

I lay on my back on the bed, looking at my raised right hand and murmured.

<b>

"The mind and body are one... huh."

<b>

I raised my hand and clenched my fist...

<b>

"My body is a beautiful girl! My mind is an old man!!"

<b>

I let my hand fall weakly onto my forehead...

<b>

"......Then, what about my heart? ...What is my heart...?"

<b>

No one is there to answer that question.
