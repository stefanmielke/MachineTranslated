# Episode 33: An Afternoon in Amukamu

「……I want to see Suzy's panties」

「Buhou!!」

<b>

Alan Edgarra's strained murmur made Lombard Blouk spit out the turkey sandwich he had in his mouth.

<b>

<b>

「You... never learn, huh? I respect you in a way」

<b>

Karl Jacobini looked at Alan with cold eyes, as if in disbelief.

<b>

「Yeah, as expected of Alan」

<b>

Bernap Long agreed with that.

<b>

「Thanks for the heartfelt compliment!」

<b>

Alan replied while blowing up his black bangs that looked just like his sister's.

<b>

<b>

「You know, things like that shouldn't be said out loud, even if you think them」

「I see. So, it’s clear that Irvin always wants to see them!」

「N-No! You idiot! That's not what I meant!!」

<b>

Irvin blushed and huffed.

<b>

「You don't want to see them?」

「…………」

<b>

「You guys, is this really a topic for mealtime?」

<b>

Willie Hodgson admonished Alan, looking exasperated...

<b>

「No, even if you're a senior trying to act mature, Willie is still with us, right?」

「…………」

<b>

「...You want to see them, right?」

「「…………」」

<b>

「...Suzy's butt was cute, wasn't it?」

「「「「…………」」」」

<b>

「Haa~~... are we a group of criminals here?」

「No! Wait, Karl! Don't make statements that could be misunderstood!」

<b>

Willie hurriedly asked Karl to correct himself.

<b>

<b>

「Misunderstandings aside... what are we talking about while eating? If we're not criminals, then we're a group of perverts, right? They're pretty much the same thing!」

「What are you doing, acting all moralistic by yourself? Karl! You're a guy too, right?! Don't you have any interest?! In Suzy's panties!!!」

<b>

「I-It's not that! The topic we're discussing isn't suitable for mealtime, and it's against public morals! Do you have no sense of reason?! Alan! Are you a beast or something?!」

「But, you know... before summer vacation, Suzy was pretty much defenseless, with her skirt blowing up in the wind and all. But after summer vacation, she became like an iron wall. What does that even mean?!」

<b>

Alan shouted that he had seen her two or three times a day. Wow, he was a stalker, thought Karl.

<b>

<b>

「During summer vacation, she probably became aware of herself as a lady, right? That's a good thing, isn't it?」

「That was my only source of healing! Give me back the Suzy from back then!!」

「So we really are a group of perverts.」

「Wait, Karl! It's understandable that Alan is a pervert, but don't lump us all together!」

<b>

「Give me back my Suzy!!!」

「She's not yours!!」

「Ah, she's not yours either.」

「Yeah, she's not Alan's either.」

「Y-You guys, don't suddenly synchronize your breaths like that!」

<b>

「By the way, you! Didn't you say you wanted to drown in Mia's chest just the other day?!」

「That chest is still mine!」

<b>

「No! Mia isn't yours either!」

<b>

Willie adjusted his small glasses and declared.

<b>

「Has this guy lost all restraint since his sister disappeared?」

<b>

Irvin muttered in disbelief.

<b>

「I just want to dive into Mia's chest and stick my nose into Suzy's panties!!」

「Uwah! No way! This guy is a complete pervert and criminal!」

「...We really need to do something about this guy.」

<b>

Alan shouted that his wishes were completely natural! Karl declared him a pervert, and Lombard stood up slowly.

<b>

The boys' lunch break passed in a peaceful (?) manner.

<b>

<b>

「Well then, I'll leave the rest to you, Will」

<b>

Daisy Jameson said to William from atop the carriage.

<b>

「Leave it to me. Though, I can only do so much...」

「Hehe, that's fine. Just having you here gives the children a sense of security.」

「If that's the case, then I'm glad... Please take care of yourself too, Daisy.」

「Thank you, Will. Well then, I’ll be counting on you.」

<b>

William watched Daisy leave the school grounds before turning back towards the school building.

<b>

<b>

At the entrance of the school, Colin was waiting to greet William.

<b>

「Did Daisy-sensei go to the temple?」

「Yeah, she just left.」

「Huh? Is something wrong with the teacher?」

<b>

From behind Colin, Dana asked in a carefree tone.

<b>

「Dana, didn't you hear? The head priest Henry is going out this afternoon, so Daisy-sensei is taking care of the temple while he's away, remember?」

<b>

Colin pushed up his glasses and explained to Dana with an exasperated look.

<b>

「Is that so? But why is Daisy-sensei watching over the temple? What about the priests?」

「Apparently, they’re either sick or have overlapping business trips to various villages, so they said they were short-handed.」

「Hmm, so the temple is short on staff too.」

「I think it was just a coincidence. So, it just so happens that I'm here at school, and I was entrusted with this task.」

「I see~~. Well, I’ll be counting on you! The knight candidate Will, acting as the teacher!」

<b>

Dana cheerfully patted William on the back.

<b>

「Yeah! Leave it to me, Dana! Now then! Shall we head to the training grounds? Let's train plenty!!」

「Huh? Wait, what?」

<b>

Dana was pulled by the collar and let out a confused voice.

<b>

「Hehe, do your best, Dana! Make sure to listen to what Teacher William says, okay?」

「Huh? What? Huhhh?!」

<b>

Colin waved cheerfully at the two as they left.

Dana floated several question marks around her head as she was dragged off to the training grounds by William.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

「David!! The arrows haven't been restocked! What's going on?!」

「Y-Yes! They are scheduled to arrive this afternoon, so it should be coming soon.」

「It's already past noon! Is Gary in charge this month?! I need to have a word with him!」

<b>

Howard frowned at the inventory sheet in the warehouse.

<b>

Around the Amukamu forest, several outposts have been built at regular intervals.

These are small fortresses with watchtowers set up to monitor the forest, as well as warehouses for weapons and other supplies.

<b>

In Amukamu village, every three months, four times a year, a regular meeting is held to report on the state of the forest, along with maintenance of weapons and equipment, involving the group leader for that three-month period and the village head.

<b>

However, the formal meetings are only strict at the beginning; after that, they turn into a banquet for relaxation...

For this reason, many who do not need to participate in the meeting gather at the first outpost on this day.

<b>

And to participate in the banquet, it is an unspoken requirement to clean and tidy up inside and outside the outpost before and during the meeting.

<b>

<b>

「...Somehow, the head today seems even more fired up than usual.」

「Yeah, how should I put it... his eyes are scarier than ever... Is the 'Gray Iron Demon God' still active?」

「It can't be helped; he's in a particularly bad mood today.」

「What’s up? Do you know something, Kenneth?」

「...Well, you see, today’s regular meeting, including the village chief, the three families went to Deckenberg and can’t attend, right?」

「Yeah, I heard it was some urgent summons.」

「Also, most of the heads of the groups who were supposed to attend today can’t make it either.」

「Oh, I heard there was a request from the villages of Argoshi and Uard.」

「So the head has no choice but to attend today.」

<b>

「So, he’s in a bad mood because of the poor attendance of the dignitaries? Still, it’s just a matter of timing, isn’t it?」

「It’s not that. The head was planning to go to Corptown today if nothing came up.」

「Huh? That’s... not like the head to be so selfish... no, wait... so he’s in a bad mood because he can’t go to Corptown?」

<b>

「Well, to put it plainly, that’s it... Do you guys know Suzy from the head’s family?」

「Oh, that cute red-haired girl? I’ve seen her a few times. Right, Rufino?」

「Randolph, don’t you remember? At the beginning of summer, the head caught a boa, and we went to retrieve it together, right?」

「Oh, I remember that. It was quite a hassle to carry it, right?」

「That’s right. You didn’t know that Suzy was the one who took down most of the wolves that day? You saw it from a distance, right? Don’t you remember?」

「Is that so? Now that you mention it, I think I heard Long say something like that. Well, I’ve definitely heard that Suzy from the head’s family is quite skilled.」

<b>

「It seems like both Rufino and Randolph don’t quite understand Suzy’s abilities, huh?」

「No, I thought it was amazing that she took down a wolf by herself, but if she’s connected to the Cloud family, I can accept that... Is that all? Well, I know she’s cute! Right, Randolph?」

「Yeah, I know that!」

<b>

「You guys... this is ridiculous! So, do you know about the Red Death Stalker that appeared at the beginning of last month?」

「Oh, I know. It was when the kids were hunting and ran into it, right? They were supposed to be hunting in a safe zone, but somehow it got mixed in.」

「Yeah, I’m surprised they made it out safely. It would be impossible for just the kids to take down that giant scorpion. Was there an adult with them? If there are three low-ranked ones, they can manage to take down one.」

<b>

「There were no adults. And the ones that attacked were five Red Death Stalkers.」

「W-What?! That’s impossible! With three low-ranked ones, there’s no way to handle five! That hard exoskeleton! If you don’t hit the joints properly, what can you do? With three, you can barely manage to take down one, right? Five all at once... it’s impossible unless you have high-ranking... at least mid-ranking or higher!」

<b>

「That’s the thing... they were taken down in an instant.」

「「Huh?」」

「They cut through that hard exoskeleton and took down all five in an instant. I saw the prey, and the cuts were incredibly clean! I can say for sure... that girl has the strength to cut through a lump of iron!」

「W-Wait! Are you saying... she did it all by herself?」

「Yeah? Who else could it be?」

「T-That way of speaking makes it sound like she took them all down by herself!」

「That’s exactly what I’m saying!」

<b>

「「N-No way!!」」

「And apparently, the sword she was using at that time broke. So the head immediately placed an order at the workshop in Corptown, and it was supposed to be delivered today.」

「...So, that means the head was supposed to receive it personally and hand it over to her?」

「Exactly! Do you understand now?!」

<b>

「I get it, I understand Suzy’s abilities and the head’s feelings. But... why do you know so much about this, Kenneth?」

「Yeah, and why do you seem so happy when talking about Suzy? ...Are you a stalker? That’s a bit creepy.」

<b>

「Huh? Idiot! Of course, I know because I have a membership card!」

「Huh? No! What are you talking about? What membership card?」

「The membership card for the 'Suzy Cloud Fan Club'!!!」

「「What the heck is thatーーーーっ?！！」」

「What are you all doingーーーーーーーっっっ?！！！」

<b>

Howard's thunder struck. It was a rumble of thunder.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

「Rider... am I protecting her?」

<b>

Clutching his chest, Rider muttered to the gravestone.

<b>

Rider Haggard was now kneeling alone in the cemetery behind the temple.

The well-maintained white gravestone, adorned with a bouquet of flowers, bore the name 'Ravinia Cloud'.

Rider's gaze was gentle as he stared at it.

<b>

<b>

Rider joined the royal capital knight order six years ago after going through the knight candidate course in high school.

He spent two years on the western frontier, fighting against demons and magical beasts on the front lines.

<b>

Recognized for his achievements during that time, he was assigned to the royal capital's protection mission in just two years.

During his time in the capital, he was treated well, and training among capable individuals provided a sufficient environment for him to strengthen his abilities.

<b>

However, as he was recognized for his skills and moved closer to the center, he found himself distancing from the front lines.

This made Rider feel anxious.

<b>

<b>

There are not a few people from Amukamu who join the knight order.

However, very few manage to serve until retirement.

Most seek the front lines and return to Amukamu again.

<b>

The knight order also values maintaining connections with those from Amukamu.

There’s the benefit of being able to entrust reliable individuals from Amukamu with frontline responses in case of emergencies, so they always welcome new recruits from Amukamu.

<b>

<b>

Following in the footsteps of those predecessors, Rider decided to return to Amukamu in his fifth year of service.

Above all, he wanted to protect as many people as he could within his reach... fulfilling a promise made with a girl he once knew.

<b>

<b>

「If I keep asking you about this, you’ll get mad at me again.」

<b>

Rider stood up with a wry smile.

<b>

(Still, when I see that girl, I can’t help but remember you... your words.)

<b>

「I’ll come again... Ravinia. I have to go now, or your father will scold me.」

<b>

With a smile directed at the white gravestone, Rider left the cemetery.

As he exited the temple grounds, he happened to run into Daisy's carriage, which had just returned.

<b>

<b>

「Oh? I was wondering whose horse this was... Good day, Rider. Were you visiting a grave?」

「Yes, hello, Daisy-sensei. I just finished. I need to head to the first outpost now.」

「Ah, today is the regular meeting that happens every three months. Thank you for your hard work.」

「Thank you. By the way, what brings you here at this time? I noticed there were no head priests or priests in the temple...」

「Well, you see, everyone’s timing got a bit off... and the temple ended up being empty. So today, I’m watching over it.」

<b>

「...So, Henry isn’t there either? Then who’s at the school?」

「Henry went to the temple in Corptown for the 'spiritual communion'. Originally, the head priest was supposed to go, but... he seems to have fallen ill... So, Henry had to go with Suzy. Right now, Will is watching over the children at school.」

「I see, having her with him must be reassuring for Henry. Will is reliable, so there shouldn’t be any problems.」

<b>

「Oh? Rider, have you already sparred with Suzy?」

「Yes, I had a match with her the other day. It’s a bit embarrassing to admit, but I was easily thrown around.」

「Really! Even you, Rider?!」

「Yes, she’s beyond the norm.」

<b>

Rider smiled shyly, and Daisy responded with a cheerful "Oh my!".

<b>

<b>

「Oh dear! I’ve kept you too long with our conversation! I’m sorry for holding you up.」

「No, more importantly, are you okay on your own? Should I send someone to help you?」

「Oh, I know how to protect myself, you know?」

<b>

She placed her hand on her chest and smiled.

<b>

「That’s right, Daisy-sensei has the rank of 'Barrier User - Supplement'. I apologize for the unnecessary suggestion.」

「No, no, thank you for your concern. But you should hurry, it’s already past 1 PM. It’s not something I should say since I was the one who held you up.」

「That’s true, I’ll head over before Howard’s thunder strikes. Thank you for the chat. See you!」

<b>

Rider quickly mounted his horse, bid farewell to Daisy, and galloped away.

Daisy waved goodbye with a smile as she watched him go.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

「Elrose! The wind has picked up! Please close the second-floor window!」

<b>

Sonia Cloud called out to Elrose from her wheelchair in the garden.

Sonia moved her wheelchair to bring in the laundry.

<b>

Usually, Sonia doesn’t use the wheelchair much inside the house.

Especially since Suzy started living with her, she hardly used it at home.

<b>

However, this morning was a bit different.

Perhaps it was the change of seasons, but her knees were acting up strangely.

Her experience told her that it was better not to force herself to walk during such times.

<b>

Before leaving, Suzy had worried about her, but Sonia had smiled and reassured her that it was nothing serious.

<b>

<b>

「It’s already tea time... I wonder if she left a while ago...」

<b>

Sonia murmured as she brought in the laundry.

She loosened the laundry line and, without standing up from her wheelchair, placed the laundry into the basket she held on her lap one by one.

As she was doing this, she noticed Gilberto walking towards her.

<b>

「Oh? Gilberto, what happened to that bird?」

「Well, I caught a bird that’s rarely seen and thought it would please the young lady.」

<b>

He was holding two decapitated birds upside down in his right hand.

It seemed the blood had already been drained. The brown-bodied bird with a white collar was something not often seen around here.

However, it has no peculiar taste and is quite delicious, so it is appreciated by those who know it.

<b>

「I’m so happy! That child loves birds, so she’ll surely be delighted. Gilberto, please stay for dinner today; Howard will enjoy himself with everyone anyway.」

<b>

Gilberto smiled happily, saying, "I appreciate it." It seemed he decided to enjoy the feast.

He then took the birds to the kitchen through the northern back door.

<b>

<b>

「In about an hour, she should be back...」

<b>

Sonia said, looking towards the southern road... the road leading to Corptown.

At that moment, the wind blew from the north... from the Amukamu forest.

<b>

「...Has the wind picked up a bit?」

<b>

Sonia placed her hand on her hair to keep it from being blown around and murmured that it wasn’t a very pleasant wind...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Rustle... rustle, shadows swayed in the forest.

<b>

<b>

<b>

「Eihab. I came as promised, but... is it okay to start? The knight order has postponed their departure, right?」

<b>

From behind, a figure in a butler's outfit emerged and silently knelt.

<b>

「Yes, I have been instructed by Lord Clarimond to proceed as planned.」

<b>

Orbet's mouth twisted into a wide grin.

<b>

「I see, then let’s begin! Eihab, is everything prepared?」

「Yes, everything is ready.」

<b>

「Good, Lawrence!」

「Yes!」

<b>

From the shadows, a boy about 14 years old in a butler's outfit appeared and knelt.

<b>

<b>

「Laila!」

「Yes.」

<b>

A girl of similar age also appeared in a butler's outfit.

<b>

<b>

「Barney!」

「Yes!」

<b>

A slightly older boy emerged from behind.

<b>

<b>

「Putora!」

「Over here...」

<b>

The oldest girl followed from further back.

<b>

<b>

All of them were silver-haired, blue-eyed boys and girls.

They were all dressed in butler outfits, kneeling and bowing their heads around Orbet.

<b>

「Eliza and Doug are waiting at the designated location.」

<b>

The oldest boy, called Eihab, informed Orbet.

<b>

<b>

Orbet looked at the satisfied kneeling figures and spoke.

<b>

「Now then! Let’s begin the feast! It’s simple! Just surround, drive, trample, and clean up! ...Easy, right?」

<b>

He raised one finger, closed one eye, and playfully winked.

<b>

「Now! Everyone! It’s time for the banquet!」

<b>

Orbet dramatically spread his arms.

His dark, joyful voice echoed through the dimly lit trees of the forest and was absorbed into its depths.

<b>

<b>

One of the masters of the night, the True Vampire, who has existed for 300 years.

Orbet Mash, the 'Child Eater'.

<b>

Now, in the depths of Amukamu forest, that darkness began to move silently and cunningly.
