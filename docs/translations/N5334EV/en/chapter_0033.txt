# 33 - Late Afternoon in Amkam

"I wanna see ...... Suzy's pants."

Bwah!"

<blank>

At the sound of Alan Edgarra's mumbling, Lombard Blouk blew out the turkey sandwich he was holding in his mouth.

<blank>

<blank>

You ...... never learn, I respect you in a way."

<blank>

Carl Jacobini gives Alan a cold look in disgust.

<blank>

Hmmm, that's Alan."

<blank>

Belknap Long agrees.

<blank>

Thanks for the mindless compliment!"

<blank>

Alan blew up his black bangs, which looked just like his sister's, over his eyes with a whoosh as he replied.

<blank>

<blank>

You know, if you think it, don't say it.

I see. I understand now that Irving is always willing to look!"

Chi! Chi! You idiot! That's not what I said!

<blank>

Irving blushes and rolls his breath.

<blank>

Don't you want to see it?"

"............"

<blank>

"Hey, you guys, is this a mealtime topic?"

<blank>

Willie Hodgson notes Alan in disgust. ......

<blank>

No, I'm not going to pretend to be the most senior adult, because Willie's with us, right?"

"............"

<blank>

You want to see ......?"

"............"

<blank>

...... Suzy's butt, wasn't it adorable?"

「「「「............」」」」

<blank>

'Hah~..., a group of criminals? Here."

No! Wait, Carl! Refrain from making misleading statements!"

<blank>

Willie looked flustered and asked Carl to correct him.

<blank>

<blank>

'Misunderstanding or not, ......, what are you talking about over dinner? If they're not criminals, are they a bunch of perverts? They're both similar, aren't they?"

What are you doing being so serious with your moral opinions all by yourself? Carl! You're a man, too! Don't you give a shit about Susie's underpants? In Susie's pants!

<blank>

I'm not going to be a part of this! What you are talking about is not something to do at a meal time, and it is against public order and morals! Don't you have any sense of reason? Alan! Are you like The Beast?

Because, you know. Before the summer vacation, they were totally unprotected, even when Stephan was not rolling them up, they were rolled up by the wind or looked indifferent. What do you mean, it's ironclad after the summer break?

<blank>

I used to see him two or three times a day!　I was a stalker, Carl said.

<blank>

<blank>

"You've become more of a lady during your summer vacation, haven't you? That's a good thing."

"My..! She was the only thing that could heal me! I want my Suzy back!

I knew we were a bunch of perverts.

Wait, Karl! I don't blame Alan for being a pervert, but don't lump him in with the rest of us!"

<blank>

I want my Suzy back!

It's not yours!

Yeah, that's not yours."

No, it's not Alan's.

Oh, you guys don't suddenly start breathing together!"

<blank>

You were the one who wanted to drown yourself in Mia's breasts! The other day you kept saying you wanted to drown yourself in Mia's breasts!"

That breast is still mine!"

<blank>

No! Because Mia doesn't belong to you either!"

<blank>

Willie says as he pushes up his smaller glasses.

<blank>

"Is this guy losing his grip now that his sister's gone?"

<blank>

Irving muttered dismissively.

<blank>

I just want to jump on Mia's chest and stick my nose in Susie's pants! I just want to jump into Mia's chest and stick my nose in Susie's pants!

'Whoa! No good, this guy! He's a total pervert and a criminal."

...... let's do something about this guy."

<blank>

What I want is perfectly natural!　Carl declared Alan a pervert, and Lombardo stood up with a yelp.

<blank>

The boys' lunch break passed by in a long and quiet (?) The boys' lunch break passed by in a long, quiet (?) manner.

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Then I'll leave the rest to you, Will."

<blank>

Daisy Jameson says a few words to William from the carriage.

<blank>

I'll leave it to you. But there's only so much I can do. ......"

"Don't worry, you're here to reassure the children.

I hope so, ......, and Miss Daisy take care."

Thank you Will, I will take good care of you then."

<blank>

William watched Daisy until she left the school grounds and then turned on his heel directly into the school building.

<blank>

<blank>

At the entrance to the school building, Colin was waiting to greet William.

<blank>

'Did Dr. Daisy go to the temple?'

Yeah, he's on his way.

What? What's wrong with you, doctor?"

<blank>

From behind Colin, Dana asked in an easygoing tone.

<blank>

Dana, didn't you hear? Didn't you tell me that Temple Superintendent Henry was going out with Sue this afternoon and that Miss Daisy was going to take care of the temple?"

<blank>

Colin pushes up his glasses and explains to Dana with an upturned, dumbfounded look in his eyes.

<blank>

'Oh, I don't know. But why is Miss Daisy on temple duty? What's up with all the priests?"

He said he had been ill and had to travel to various villages, so he had just run out of manpower.

"Hmmm, I guess temples are shorthanded too."

"I think it was just a coincidence, you know? And it just so happens that I'm at school, and I'm in charge of this place."

I see. Well, I'll be counting on you! Will, the candidate for substitute teacher knight!"

<blank>

Dana happily bangs William on the back.

<blank>

Oh! I got it, Dana! Come on! Shall we go to the training grounds now? Let's go to the training grounds and work out!

What? Huh? Huh?"

<blank>

Dana screams in confusion as William grabs her by the collar.

<blank>

I'm sure you'll do great, Dana! And listen to Dr. William, okay?"

What? That thing? Eh~?"

<blank>

Colin happily waved them off.

Dana's head was filled with question marks as William dragged her into the training hall.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

David! You're not making up for the arrows! What's going on?

He said, "Ha, hi! It's supposed to arrive this afternoon, so I thought it should be here by now."

Already round for lunch! Is Gary in charge this month? I'm going to have to insist!"

<blank>

Howard was facing the inventory sheets in the warehouse, his brow wrinkled.

<blank>

Several chokepoints are built at regular intervals around the amkam forest.

It is a small fort with a watchtower to monitor the forest and a warehouse for weapons and other supplies.

<blank>

In Amkam village, a regular meeting is held once every three months, four times a year. A regular meeting is held four times a year, once every three months, to report on forest trends, as well as to maintain weapons and weapons, with the leader of the group in charge of the three-month period and the village manager.

<blank>

However, the formal meeting is only at the beginning, followed by a banquet for consolation. ......

For this reason, many people who do not need to attend meetings gather at the One's office on these days.

<blank>

The implicit condition for attending the banquet is to clean up and tidy up the inside and outside of the Tsumesho before and during the meeting.

<blank>

<blank>

......, you seem to be more enthusiastic than ever today."

"Oh, what can I say, ...... your eyes are even more glazed over than usual ....... I think it's good that 'Gray Iron God' is still active, don't you?"

I can't help it, he's in a very bad mood today."

What? You know something? Kenneth."

...... Well, you see, the three families, including the village head, are in Dekenber, and won't be able to attend today's regular meeting, will they?"

Mm, you said something about an urgent call."

And most of the leaders of the various groups who were scheduled to attend will not be able to attend today.

Yeah, I heard there was a request from the villages of Argosi and Ouadh.

So today, the head of the church cannot avoid being there by any means necessary."

<blank>

You mean you're in a bad mood because of the poor attendance of your personal historians? I can only say it's a matter of timing.

No, he didn't. He was going to go to Copetown if there was nothing there today. The head of the church was going to go to Copetown today if nothing else."

What? That's another ...... not-so-heady egomaniacal ......, no, bad ......, so you're in a bad mood because you can't go to Copetown?"

<blank>

Well, technically speaking, yes, but ...... do you guys know Suzy at the Gozu Head's place?"

'Oh, that pretty little red-haired girl, isn't she? I've seen you a few times. Hey, Ruffino."

Randolph, don't you remember? "Don't you remember the time your head took down a boa earlier in the summer? Didn't we go with him to retrieve it?"

'Oh, didn't we have one of those? When there was quite a bit of Wolf and it was hard to carry him, right?"

'Yeah, don't you know that it was a girl named Suzy who took out most of the Wolves back then? You saw her from a distance, didn't you? Don't you remember?"

'Was that so? I wonder if that's what Team Leader Long said. Well, I've heard that Suzy at the head's place is a very skilled woman.

<blank>

Neither Ruffino nor Randolph seem to have the slightest idea what Suzy is capable of, do they?"

I thought it was great that he slaughtered the Wolf all by himself, but it also made sense that he would be related to the Cloud family. ...... isn't that all? Well, I know enough to say that she's pretty! Hey, Randolph! Randolph!

Yeah, I know that one!"

<blank>

"You guys, ......, can't help it! So, did you know that early last month the Red Death Stalker came out?"

"Yeah, I know. You said you were hunting with a group of kids and you came across one. I heard they were supposed to be hunting in a safe zone, but they got mixed up in there somewhere.

I don't know how you survived. It would have been impossible for a child alone to have gotten that big scorpion. Were there any adults with you? Even with a low group, three of us could manage to kill one of them.

<blank>

There were no adults. And the attackers were five Red Death Stalkers."

What the hell? There's no way you can do that! Three low-ranking guys can't handle five bodies! The exoskeleton is so hard! Three of us can barely control one of them at a time, and five of them at a time is absolutely impossible unless ...... you're in a high ...... or even a medium or higher rank!

<blank>

That's why ...... said it was a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment."

Huh?"

He said, "He cut through their hard exoskeletons and took out five of them in an instant. I've seen his kills, and they were really clean cuts! I assure you ......, that boy has arms that can cut down even a block of steel!"

Wait a minute! That girl is ...... no way?"

Yeah?" That's right. Who else is here?"

"Well, that makes it sound like she killed them all by herself, doesn't it?"

That's what I'm telling you!"

<blank>

Nah!"

The sword he was using at the time was broken. The head of the company immediately ordered it from a workshop in Copetown, and it was supposed to be delivered today.

......, you mean to say that he would have received it himself and handed it to her?"

That's right! Do you understand me?

<blank>

I understand what Suzy is capable of, and I understand the feelings of your head of state. I understand, but how do you know so much about ......? Kenneth.

And why do you sound so happy when you're talking about Suzy? Are you a ...... stalker? That's a little offensive, don't you think?"

<blank>

What? Idiot! What are you talking about? Of course it's because I have a membership card!"

No? Nope! What are you talking about? What's with the membership card?"

Of course it's a membership card for the Suzy Crowd Fun Club!

"What the hell is that?

You guys! What in the world are you doingooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo?

<blank>

Howard's lightning struck. It was a roaring thunder.

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ravi ......, am I protected?"

<blank>

Clutching his own chest, Ryder muttered to the gravestone.

<blank>

Ryder Haggard was now standing alone on his knees in the cemetery behind the temple.

The name "Lavinia Cloud" is engraved on a white headstone that has been well cared for and on which a bouquet of flowers has been placed.

The rider's eyes are calm as he gazes at it.

<blank>

<blank>

It was six years ago that Ryder went through the knight candidate course at the high school and joined the regular Order of the King's Guardians.

For two years, he was on the front lines of battles against demons and magical beasts in the western frontier.

<blank>

In recognition of his achievements, he was assigned to the royal guard in just two years.

While in office in King's Landing, he was treated well, and training in an environment full of talented people was sufficient for him to develop his own strength.

<blank>

However, as he was recognized for his abilities and moved to the center, he moved away from the field and the front lines.

This made the rider feel impatient.

<blank>

<blank>

Not a few people from Amcam join the knighthood.

However, few of them serve until they retire from the military.

Most of them return to AMCAM again, seeking the front line.

<blank>

The knighthood is also to be able to maintain such a connection with them and Amcam.

The company always welcomed new members from Amkam because of the advantage of being able to entrust the front line response in times of emergency to trusted Amkam personnel.

<blank>

<blank>

Ryder was one of those who decided to follow in the footsteps of his predecessors and return to Amcam in his fifth year with the company.

Above all, he wanted to protect. He wanted to protect as many people as he could ...... and the promise he made to a girl he had once made.

<blank>

<blank>

If I had to ask you every time, you'd get mad at me again."

<blank>

Ryder stood up with a wry smile on his face.

<blank>

(Still, I can't help but think of you ...... and your words when I look at her.)

<blank>

I'll be back. ...... Ravi. I have to go now, or your father will throttle me."

<blank>

Smiling at the white headstone, Ryder left the cemetery.

As we were exiting the temple grounds, we came face to face with Daisy's carriage, which had just returned.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh?" I was wondering whose horse it was. ......, good day, Mr. Rider. Were you visiting a grave?"

Yes, hello Dr. Daisy. I just finished up. I have to go to the One's office now.

Oh, today was our regular March meeting, wasn't it? Thank you for your hard work."

Thank you very much. But what are you doing here at this hour? There didn't seem to be any temple directors or priests in the temple. ......"

But then everyone got a little off on their timings and there was no one at the ...... temple. So I'm going to be taking care of things today.

<blank>

"...... That is, Mr. Henry is not here either? Then is he at school now?"

Henry went to the temple in Copetown for a "stipend. Originally, the head priest was supposed to go, but he got sick ...... and Henry decided to go with Susie on short notice. Will is looking after the children at the school now."

I see, Master Henry is reassured that she will be with him. Will is also very strong, so there should be no problem."

<blank>

"Oh? Did you and Suzy already have an arrangement, Mr. Ryder?"

Yes, I had the pleasure of witnessing it the other day. I am embarrassed to say that I too was easily rolled."

'Well! Even Mr. Ryder? !"

Yes, because she's substandard, substandard."

<blank>

Ryder smiles shyly and Daisy replies with a smile, "Oh my gosh.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm so sorry," he said! I'm sorry for interrupting your long conversation! I'm so sorry I held you up."

No, I'm sorry, but are you sure you're okay on your own? Shall I send someone who is available?"

Oh, I do know how to defend myself, don't you?"

<blank>

He puts his hand on his own chest and smiles.

<blank>

I know, I know, Dr. Daisy has the rank of 'warder/supplement'. I apologize for the unnecessary suggestion."

Thank you for your concern. But hurry up, it's already around 1:00 p.m. I've been holding you back. It's not my place to tell you this, but..."

Yes, I'll be on my way before Commander Howard's thunder strikes. Thank you for sharing your story. Bye!

<blank>

The rider quickly mounted his horse, said goodbye to Daisy, and rode on.

Daisy was still smiling and waving her hands off.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Elle Rose! The wind's picking up! Close the upstairs windows, please!"

<blank>

Sonia Cloud called out to Elrose in the house as she sat in her wheelchair in the yard.

Sonia sits in her wheelchair and goes to move it to get the laundry in.

<blank>

Sonia usually does not use her wheelchair much in the house.

Especially after Suzy came to live with us, she rarely used it at home.

<blank>

This morning, however, was a little different.

Perhaps it is the change of season, but my knees are tingling strangely.

Her experience told her not to force herself to walk in these situations.

<blank>

Suzy was worried about me before I left, but I sent her off with a smile and told her it was no big deal.

<blank>

<blank>

"It's time for tea ......, I think she's leaving the other side ......"

<blank>

Sonia takes in the laundry while muttering something like that.

He loosens the clothesline and, without getting up from his wheelchair, puts one load of laundry after another into the laundry basket held in his lap.

As I was taking in the laundry, I noticed Gilberto walking toward me.

<blank>

Gilbert, what's wrong with the bird? Gilbert, what happened to that bird?"

"Hey, I caught a bird that I rarely see and thought it would be a nice present for the young lady."

<blank>

Two birds, head down, are lowered upside down in the right hand.

It looks like it has already been drained of blood. A bird with a brown body and a white collar is a rare sight around here.

But the meat has no habits and tastes good, so it is a bird that is appreciated by those who know it.

<blank>

Gilbert, you're welcome to join us for dinner tonight. Gilbert, you are welcome to join us for dinner tonight, I'm sure Howard will have fun with everyone.

<blank>

Gilberto's cheeks relaxed happily as he said, "Thank you very much for that. It seems that he has decided to treat us.

He carried the bird straight to the kitchen through the north kitchen door.

<blank>

<blank>

I wonder if she'll be back in another hour. ......

<blank>

With that said, he turned his attention to the road leading south to ......, which leads to Copetown.

At that moment, the wind zaaaaa and blows across from the north ......, from the forest of Amkam.

<blank>

......, I think the wind has picked up a little bit."

<blank>

Sonia, placing her hand on her hair to keep it out of the wind, muttered something like, "It's not a very nice wind, but ...... it's not a very nice wind.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Zawari......Zawari, several shadows sway in the forest.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Ahab. I'm here as promised, but I'm not sure if ...... is a good place to start. The Knights have not left, have they?"

<blank>

With a swoosh, a figure in a butler's uniform appeared from the shadows behind him and knelt down without a sound.

<blank>

Yes, Mr. Clarimonde has instructed me to proceed as planned.

<blank>

Orbet's mouth twists wide.

<blank>

'Well, then, let me just get started! Ahab! How's it going?

Yes, everything is done.

<blank>

All right, Lawrence!

Yes!"

<blank>

Again from the shadows, this time a boy about 14 years old in a butler's uniform appears and kneels down.

<blank>

<blank>

Laila!"

Yes."

<blank>

A girl about the same age showed up, also in a butler's uniform.

<blank>

<blank>

Bernie!"

Ha!"

<blank>

A somewhat older boy also emerges from behind him.

<blank>

<blank>

Ptola!"

"Here's ......."

<blank>

A girl, who appears to be the oldest, follows further behind.

<blank>

<blank>

They are all silver-haired, blue-eyed boys and girls.

Equally dressed in butler's uniform, he is kneeling on one knee and hanging his head around the orbette.

<blank>

Eliza and Doug are waiting in place.

<blank>

The oldest boy in the group, called Ahab, told Orbet.

<blank>

<blank>

Orbet looks at those who hang their heads in satisfaction and speaks out.

<blank>

'Well! Let's start preparing for the feast! What? What we have to do is simple! Just surround them, drive them out, lay waste to them, and clean up the mess! It's ...... easy, isn't it?"

<blank>

He held up one finger, meditated on one eye, and let a wink fly happily.

<blank>

Come on! Gentlemen! It's time to feast!

<blank>

Orbet theatrically spreads his hands.

Its darkly amused voice echoes through the dimly lit forest trees and is sucked deep into them.

<blank>

<blank>

True Vampire, one of the Lords of the Dark Night, who has existed for 300 years.

Orbet Mash, a.k.a. "The Child Eater."

<blank>

Now, in the forest of Amkam, that darkness began to move silently and cunningly, without a sound.
