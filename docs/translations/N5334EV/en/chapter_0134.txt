# 122 Mia is the Merciless Queen of Thorns

Lo, Rose Whip?

Mia, what a thing you're bringing out!

This is really pissed off, isn't it? This is bad, isn't it?

<blank>

"...... Karen. What happened between the girls and Mia before the mock battle?"

"Well, um,...... they went inside to get ready first, but Lurie and the others didn't come out of the locker room until ...... later."

<blank>

I asked Karen again if anything more had happened before we got here. I asked her if there had been any more incidents before we got here, and she told me that there had been a bit of a scuffle in front of the locker room.

<blank>

Also, when I went into the locker room after Miss Lurie and her friends, I found that Mia's robe, which had been provided for her, was soaked with water, and the cane for Mia had been broken and thrown away. ......

<blank>

Wow, you're doing quite a bit for us, Miss Lurie.

But you can also visit .......

<blank>

...... Do you think that's enough to make me lose my temper, Mia?"

Hmmm?"

<blank>

Bibi and I both tilt our heads.

From a general point of view, I think it's a very bad thing, but I wonder if Mia would get that mad.

That girl's boiling point is way out of the common sense frame of reference.

<blank>

I would have dried off the wet robe with a light "dry".

For Mia, who specializes in manipulating water, harassing people with water has no effect on her.

I am sure that he had no intention of using the cane from the beginning.

<blank>

However, Karen said that before entering the locker room, after the question and answer with Miss Lurie and the others, she felt that Mia's behavior had changed a little.

Hmmm, what kind of exchange did they have?

<blank>

"......, but it's ...... that got the hate."

What? What, huh? Karen."

I'm not sure what to say! Uh ...... I was more surprised that Mia could use magic so easily. ......"

Yes, that's right! I have heard that you have been out of control in training every day since your spiritual seal was carved!

<blank>

Not only Karen and Miss Cordelia, but also a few of the students around us are questioning this.

Mia's outburst was probably well-known in its own right to students of magic.

<blank>

I'm sure he did it on purpose! Of course they did it on purpose!"

Huh?"

She was carving a deep groove in the spirit by deliberately causing it to explode!"

'Oh, no. ...... such a reckless thing! If the spirit groove is broken, there's no way out!"

She's crazy enough to push it right to the edge!"

<blank>

Bibi was telling them why Mia was having the outburst, and they both looked speechless and incredulous.

<blank>

No wonder. It's an unbelievable way to do things, considering common sense.

Normally, one would slowly continue to pass magic through the spiritual groove and deepen the state of that groove.

<blank>

Certainly, if magic were to go out of control, the psychic groove used at that time would be imprinted more deeply into the body and mind than usual, but it would also cause irreparable damage to the body and etheric body, making it a very dangerous act.

<blank>

The teacher does not recommend this approach. Rather, they usually stop.

<blank>

Mia, however, was not normal.

<blank>

<blank>

In case you are wondering, I consider Bibi of Amcam to be a truly excellent human being, even though he is my friend.

She never stops trying.

His constant upward movement and earnest, steady progress is truly worthy of respect.

I am proud of my friend.

Since entering the academy, Koch feels it is no surprise that he is known as one of the best students in 20 years.

<blank>

But Mia, another proud friend of mine, is definitely a one-in-a-hundred-year ...... or even one-in-two-hundred-year genius.

<blank>

She is fundamentally different from Bibi.

<blank>

I don't mean to imply that Mia is a lazy person, contrary to Bibi.

She is also a person with an inquisitive mind, and her pursuit of things is unrivaled.

The degree of concentration once you get into it is extraordinary.

<blank>

Mia is an extremely unique magical genius who understands magic intuitively and uses her senses alone to exercise it beyond human capacity, which is outside the bounds of common sense.

<blank>

<blank>

I want you to imagine.

If a hard-working, inquisitive, 1-in-200 year old genius were to go and immerse himself in one thing, he would go to .......

I am not sure how absurd the results of this would be.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

This outburst training was done at Mia's strong request, under the supervision of her teachers ...... Ursula and Joseline, though they are both teachers .......

The teachers who were supervising Mia's performance were pale from start to finish at her impossible sense of magical balance and her audacity to attack until she was on the verge of breaking.

<blank>

<blank>

Furthermore, according to Mia, within the first week, she was able to deploy basic and elementary magic with the snap of a finger.

And in the week that followed, he said, he was able to use most of the wood-based magic he was good at. I thought I could do it in about ten days, but it took me two weeks. Mia declared.

<blank>

I thought it was understandable that the teachers, who witnessed such an unbelievably unorthodox rate of growth in Mia, were very much preoccupied, and had to pull themselves together several times in a grand gesture.

Well, this is a truly sympathetic incident.

<blank>

And now, the Lurie girls are dealing with such an insane being, who could be called an outsider.

Although they had it coming, we still cannot help but feel sympathy for them.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, the sound of something sharply hitting the ground echoed around the area. and the sound of something being sharply struck echoed around the area.

Mia hit the ground with a Rose Whip.

<blank>

He further brings his face close to Miss Lurie and mumbles something to her.

<blank>

Oi oi oi, Miss Lurie, who was told something by Mia, made a little scream with her face scrunched up, right?

<blank>

The ivy is tightening up on the limbs, but that thing, is it okay? If you do it any more, it's going to break, isn't it? Miss Lurie's eyes are teary!

Wow! Ivy started wrapping around my face as well, like it was covering my mouth, you know?

Hey! You girls don't look so good in public anymore, do you? Are you sure you're okay?

<blank>

<blank>

Are you okay?" But I want you to rest assured. Even I can use a little healing, so even if it breaks, I can fix it right here and now.

?

But I can't put it back together as neatly as Sue did, so if I bent it and spliced it, I'm ...... sorry?"

!!!!"

Oh! But then I'd have to fold it again, and then have it healed nicely afterwards? Ne? Mmmmmmmmmm."

Nnoooo! Nnooooo!!!!"

<blank>

COWACK! What a mia cawwah!

I'm kind of caught in the middle of this coy conversation by Susie Year!

...... Well, when I say "Susie Ear," I just mean listening with the "sound collection" of wind magic. ......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Mia waves her arm, and a powerful burst of sound echoes around the area from her feet.

It's the sound of Rose Whip hitting the ground.

<blank>

Like the whip of a beast of prey, every time the Rose Whip is wielded, the thorny ivy wriggles and clamps down on its prey at the command of the Lord.

<blank>

The Rose Whip is clothed in Mia's blue magic and draws a faint trail in space.

It is very beautiful and cannot help but attract people's eyes, but at the same time, it is a very scary suggestion.

<blank>

Whenever the sound of whips being struck echoes, not only Miss Lurie and her friends, but also some of the students around them jump up and down.

<blank>

Then Mia deepened the mouth of her thin smile even more and was about to give it one of her biggest whips when .......

<blank>

"Alright, that's it! That's it! It's a game!

<blank>

At that moment, Dr. Keira Shandra loudly signaled the end of the mock battle.

<blank>

Before I knew it, Ms. Shandra, the teacher in charge of the support department, had replaced the unreliable assistant teacher as the judge.

<blank>

In general, Mr. Joslin, you have been absorbed in the commentary and watching the game all the time! Do your job, teacher!

<blank>

<blank>

With the voice of the end, Mia released the bodies of Miss Lurie and the others from the thorns with an assortment of thorns. She then turned her gaze to the audience.

Mia immediately spotted us, smiled a very, very nice smile and waved at us.

<blank>

In response, I waved my hand back with a slight twitch in my cheek.

<blank>

Waving her hand, Mia came trotting toward us immediately.

Bibi greets it with her hands on her hips.

<blank>

You! You're so amateurish, aren't you? You're so out of character!"

<blank>

As it was, Bibi asked Mia what was wrong with her when she snapped. He threw the word "I'm sorry," with the implication that it was a good idea.

<blank>

That's the thing! Listen, Bibi! She's got nothing better to do than to say that she's going to make Su-chan her concubine!

Huh?"

<blank>

Unintentionally, Bibi and I both made dumb noises. Huh? What in the world is Dare? Whose? Who?

<blank>

I said something like, "I'm going to surround you with that second son of mine, number two or three or four, and you should be thankful. I'm going to surround you with the second son, or the third son, or the fourth son, so you should be thankful.

<blank>

What are you talking about, Miss Lurie?

How can you come up with such a story?

It's full of twists and turns!

<blank>

I see what you mean: "......! I see what you mean! I'm going to go tear the little bastard apart!"

Yeah! You got it!"

Hey! Hey! Choo-choo! Hey!

<blank>

What are you talking about, Bibi? Why are you even saying radical things?

In general, what are you going to tear off?

<blank>

What? The neck?

Was it more radical?

Ready?" Sue! This is a clear, unequivocal declaration of war on AMCAM!"

"Oh? That's such an exaggeration!

What do you think would happen if these AmCam people found out about this?

What? What do you mean, what's going on? ......"

"What's more! On the day that you get in the head minister's ear! I can only see the future of an all-out war!

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

"And that's the last thing I want to happen! Grouse Mill will turn into a wasteland with not a penny of grass left!

"！！！！"

<blank>

Oh, hey, what is it, surely you now have a vision of Howard Papa running ahead of you in his black equipment?

<blank>

Do you understand? This is the most solid way to prevent that from happening! Luckily for Lurie, Mia broke his spirit to bits, so there's no more problems!"

<blank>

I'm sure I was crying like an eggling child when they put a blanket over my head and took me away to be held by the teachers. I hope he didn't regress. ......

<blank>

All that's left to do is to deal with the late son of a bitch! Everything will be all right!"

I don't think it's going to stop at all.

<blank>

Bibi's story leaps so far that my eyeballs are glued to the floor!

Why is this such a big deal? I'm not sure I'm following you from the beginning!

<blank>

Oh, I can see that Karen and Miss Cordelia are pulling back as hard as they can! I can see that Karen and Miss Cordelia, who are watching us, are pulling back as hard as they can!

I'm just kidding. Don't take it seriously!

This is a thing, right? It's called an am-cam joke, right?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, a call went out to each class to assemble.

<blank>

I'll be fine. I will protect you as I promised.

I said, "...... uh, yeah. Oh, thank you ......."

<blank>

Mia and Karen took off with us and said, "Bye," and walked away from us.

Bibi and I look away.

<blank>

And for some reason, Miss Cordelia looks at them with a slightly sad face.

<blank>

"......I knew you wouldn't rely on me. ......

<blank>

I thought I heard Miss Cordelia muttering something like that in a small voice amidst the noise and commotion around her.
