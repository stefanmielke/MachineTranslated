# Chapter 122: Mia, the Merciless Queen of Thorns

Ro, Rose Whip?!

What on earth is Mia bringing out?!

Is she seriously getting angry? This is bad, right?!

<b>

“...Karen. Before the mock battle, what happened between her and Mia?”

“Um, well... Rulii and the others said they would get ready first and went inside, but they didn’t come out of the locker room for a while…”

<b>

When I asked Karen again if there was anything else before we got to this point, it seems they had a bit of a confrontation in front of the locker room as well.

<b>

Also, when I entered the locker room after Rulii and the others, Mia’s robe was soaked, and her wand was broken and thrown away…

<b>

Wow, Rulii really did quite a number, didn’t she?

But...

<b>

“...I wonder if Mia would get angry over something like that?”

“Hmmmm?”

<b>

Bibi and I tilted our heads in confusion.

From a general perspective, it seems like a pretty terrible thing, but would Mia really get angry over that?

Her boiling point is quite outside the realm of common sense.

<b>

After all, a wet robe should have been easily dried with ‘Dry’.

For Mia, who excels at manipulating water, using water as a form of harassment would have no effect at all.

I’m sure she had no intention of using the wand from the start.

<b>

However, according to Karen, before entering the locker room, after the exchange with Rulii and the others, Mia’s demeanor seemed to change a bit.

Hmm, I wonder what kind of interaction they had?

<b>

“...But, the fact that she was disliked...”

“Eh? What do you mean, Karen?”

“Oh, no! Um... more than that, I was surprised that Mia-chan can use magic so easily…”

“Y-yes! I’ve heard that she has been having outbursts during training every day since she engraved the spirit seal!”

<b>

Not just Karen and Cordelia, but some of the students around were also expressing their doubts about this.

Mia’s outbursts must have been somewhat famous among the students learning magic.

<b>

“Such a thing! She must have been doing it on purpose!”

““Huh?””

“That girl was deepening her spirit channel by intentionally causing outbursts!”

“W-wait, that’s... that’s reckless! If the spirit channel breaks, there’s no going back!!”

“Attacking that limit is what makes her so insane!”

<b>

Bibi was explaining to the two why Mia was causing outbursts. The two were left speechless, looking incredulous.

<b>

It’s no wonder; from a common-sense perspective, it’s an impossible method.

Normally, one would slowly channel magical power through the spirit channel, deepening its state.

<b>

Indeed, if magic were to explode, the spirit channel used at that time would be engraved deeper into the mind and body than usual, but at the same time, it could inflict irreparable damage to one’s physical and etheric body, making it a very dangerous act.

<b>

Such a method is not recommended by teachers. Rather, they would normally stop it.

<b>

However, Mia was different from the norm.

<b>

<b>

By the way, I think Bibi from Amukam is truly an excellent person, even as my friend.

She does not neglect her efforts.

Her constant pursuit of improvement and her sincere, steady progress are truly admirable.

She is my proud friend.

Since entering the academy, I feel it’s only natural that she is said to be a genius once every twenty years.

<b>

But, my other proud friend, Mia, is undoubtedly a genius once every hundred... no, once every two hundred years.

<b>

She fundamentally differs from Bibi.

<b>

I’m not saying that Mia is a lazy person, unlike Bibi.

This girl is also filled with curiosity, and her attitude toward pursuing things is unmatched by others.

The degree of concentration she shows when she becomes engrossed is extraordinary.

<b>

Mia understands magic intuitively and can wield it beyond the average with just her senses, making her an extremely unique magical genius who exists outside the realm of common sense.

<b>

<b>

Imagine this.

What kind of absurd results would arise if a genius who is diligent and filled with curiosity, one in two hundred years, were to immerse herself in a single pursuit...?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

This explosive training was at Mia’s strong request, under the supervision of our teachers... specifically, Ms. Ursula and Ms. Joslyn.

The supervising teachers were reportedly pale-faced the entire time due to Mia’s unbelievable balance of magical power and her boldness in pushing the limits to the brink of breaking.

<b>

<b>

Furthermore, according to Mia, within the first week, she was able to deploy basic and beginner-level magic with just a snap of her fingers.

And in the following week, she was able to use most of the wood-type magic she was good at. “But I thought I could do it in about ten days, so taking two weeks was a bit too long, huh?” Mia said.

<b>

It’s no wonder the teachers, witnessing Mia’s unbelievably out-of-the-norm growth rate, were greatly troubled and repeatedly flabbergasted.

Indeed, it’s an event that one cannot help but sympathize with.

<b>

And now, the Rulii and the others are facing such an absurdly unreasonable existence.

Though it’s their own doing, I can’t help but feel sympathy.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

At that moment, a sharp sound of something striking echoed around.

Mia slammed the Rose Whip onto the ground.

<b>

She then leaned closer to Rulii and whispered something to her.

<b>

Hey, hey, Rulii’s face twisted and she let out a small scream after being told something by Mia, right?

<b>

The vines are tightening around her limbs, but is she okay? If it goes any tighter, she might break, right? Rulii looks like she’s about to cry!

Whoa! Vines are starting to wrap around her face, covering her mouth?!

Hey! A girl shouldn’t be making such a face in front of others?! Is she really okay?!

<b>

<b>

“Are you okay? But I want you to rest assured. I can use a little healing too, so if you break, I can fix you right here!”

“?!”

“But I can’t make it look perfect like Su-chan, so if it ends up crooked... I’m sorry, okay?”

“!!!”

“Oh! But then I can just break it again and have it fixed nicely afterward, right? Right? Ufufufufu.”

“Uuu! Uuuuuuuuu!!!”

<b>

Scary! Mia is really scary!!

It seems like this scary conversation was overheard by Suziya!

...Well, even if I say “Suziya,” she’s just eavesdropping with the wind magic “Sound Gathering”...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As Mia swung her arm, a powerful explosion sound echoed from her feet.

The sound of the Rose Whip striking the ground.

<b>

Like a beast tamer’s whip, every time the Rose Whip was swung, the thorny vines writhed in obedience to their master’s command, tightening around their prey.

<b>

The Rose Whip, wrapped in Mia’s blue magical power, traced a faint trajectory in the air.

It was very beautiful, captivating the eyes of those who beheld it, but at the same time, it was a very frightening glow.

<b>

With each sound of the whip striking, not only Rulii and the others but also some of the students around flinched in their bodies.

<b>

And just as Mia deepened her thin smile and prepared to swing the whip even larger...

<b>

“Alright! That’s enough!! The match is over!!!”

<b>

At that moment, Ms. Keira Shandra loudly announced the end of the mock battle.

<b>

Before I knew it, Ms. Shandra, in charge of the support department, had taken over as the judge, replacing the unreliable assistant teacher.

<b>

After all, Ms. Joslyn had been completely engrossed in explaining and watching here! Do your job, teacher in charge!!

<b>

<b>

With the announcement of the end, Mia easily released Rulii and the others from the thorns. She then turned her gaze toward the audience.

As soon as she spotted us, Mia showed a very, very nice smile and waved her hand.

<b>

In response, I waved back with a slight twitch of my cheeks.

<b>

While waving, Mia quickly made her way toward us with a light jog.

Bibi welcomed her with her hands on her hips.

<b>

“You! You were pretty rough against amateurs! Isn’t that unlike you?!”

<b>

Bibi then threw words at Mia, asking what was up with her being angry.

<b>

“Well, you see! Listen, Bibi-chan! That girl went so far as to say she’d make Su-chan her mistress?!”

““Huh?””

<b>

We both let out a dumbfounded voice. Huh? Who on earth? Whose? What about?

<b>

“She said something like, ‘I’ll surround that second son or third son or fourth son, so be grateful!’ so of course... right?”

<b>

Hey, hey, hey, what are you talking about, Rulii?!

How on earth did such a story come up?!

There are so many things to question!!

<b>

“...I see! I understand the story! Then I’ll go tear that little brat apart!”

“Okay! I’m counting on you!”

“Wait?! Wait! Wait! Wait a minute!!”

<b>

What are you saying, Bibi?! Why are you saying such extreme things too?!

What on earth do you plan to tear apart?!

<b>

“Tear apart? The neck, of course?!”

“Was that more extreme?!!”

“Listen, Su! This is a clear declaration of war against Amukam!”

“Wha?! That’s way too exaggerated!!”

“What do you think will happen if the people from Amukam find out about this?!”

“Eh? W-what will happen...”

“Furthermore! If it reaches the ears of the head, there’s only a future of full-scale war ahead!!”

“Whaaaaaaaat?!!”

“If that happens, the land of Gruusmil will turn into a wasteland with not a single blade of grass left!!”

“!!!!!!”

Ah, what is this? I can definitely envision Howard Papa, clad in black armor, leading the charge right now?!

<b>

“Do you understand?! To prevent that, this is the most solid way to go about it!! Fortunately, Rulii has already been completely broken mentally by Mia, so there’s no problem now!”

<b>

Indeed, when she was covered with a blanket and carried away by the teachers, she was crying like a child. I hope she hasn’t regressed to infancy...

<b>

“After that, if we deal with that brat, everything will be settled!!”

“I don’t feel like it’ll settle at all?!!”

<b>

Bibi’s leap in logic made my eyes spin!

Why is it becoming such a big deal?! I haven’t been able to keep up since the part about the mistress?!

<b>

Ah! I can see Karen and Cordelia, who are watching us, pulling back in shock!!

I’m joking, okay? Don’t take it seriously!

This is just... an Amukam joke, you know?!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

While we were doing that, a voice called for us to gather in our respective classes.

<b>

“Don’t worry. I’ll definitely protect you as promised.”

“...Ah, um, okay. Th-thank you…”

<b>

Mia and Karen walked away from us, saying, “See you later.”

We watched them leave, me and Bibi.

<b>

And for some reason, Cordelia was watching them leave with a slightly sad expression.

<b>

“...After all, you won’t rely on me, will you...”

<b>

Amidst the buzzing noise around us, I felt like I heard Cordelia’s small murmur.
