# Episode 93: The Grumpy Beatrice

“Hmmmm, hmmmm, soooooo……”

<b>

Vivi's voice, devoid of emotion, echoed coldly around.

<b>

Arvin...? Arvin...? Arvin!!

This person has really done it!!

Just one week into school, and he’s already raised a flag!!

And the other party is Karen, my roommate!!

<b>

Karen, with her cheeks slightly flushed, looks down and occasionally glances at Arvin with eyes that are slightly heated.

When her eyes meet Arvin's, she hurriedly looks away, fidgeting and moving her hands restlessly as her gaze wanders.

<b>

This creature is so damn cute! Damn it!!

<b>

Of all people, to raise a flag with my precious roommate! I never imagined this would happen!!

<b>

As for Arvin, he is being made to explain himself while sitting upright in front of Vivi.

He seems to have no idea why he’s being made to sit like that!

<b>

“...So! After that! You brought him along because you couldn't leave him alone, right?!”

“Isn't that right? He's Suzy's friend, so we're involved, right? We can't just leave him!”

“...That's right! Arvin is that kind of person! Because he’s Arvin, after all!!”

“What the hell is that?!!”

<b>

Everyone (mainly the girls!) lets out a big sigh.

The more I hear, the more it sounds like the Haggard family! Seriously!!

But...

<b>

“Rainy... Blue or Devil or something... who is that?”

“It's Rayleigh Niven, my lady. He’s not someone you need to concern yourself with...”

<b>

Anna-Marie told me, but that doesn’t explain anything, does it?!

<b>

“Rayleigh Niven. I believe he was the second son of the former Baron Gruce Mill!”

<b>

Vivi answered in place of me. She really knows her noble information well.

Hmm, I see, so he’s also from an old noble family.

From what I hear about Arvin, he seems like quite the cocky guy, but... huh? But a baron isn’t exactly a high rank, right? For that, he sure acts pretty grand.

<b>

“Um, Karen... was it Merlin?”

“Ah,... y-yes! I’m Karen Merlin.”

“If it's not too much trouble... could you tell me what your relationship is with that second son of the Niven family?”

<b>

Colin asked Karen, something everyone was curious about. As expected of Colin!

<b>

“Ah,... um, well, Rayleigh is... technically... my... fiancé...”

“““““““！！！！”””””””

<b>

Everyone's eyes went wide! A sudden bombshell just dropped!!

<b>

“...A-Arvin!! What are you doingーーーーっ!!!!”

“Oops~~”

“‘Oops’ is not the right response!!”

<b>

Vivi is furious. Well, I can’t blame her!

In contrast, Arvin is making a light sound as if he’s thinking, ‘Did I mess up?’!!

Yeah, I’m not Vivi, but I’m feeling a little irritated! Next time we train, I’ll poke him a bit harder...!

<b>

“B-but, that being said, it’s just something that our parents decided... so for me, it’s...”

<b>

Karen is saying it’s okay... like, it’s a common story, right? But I don’t think it’s that simple!

Everyone is yelling at Arvin, but he’s dodging it lightly, and Karen is flustered watching.

It’s quite chaotic.

<b>

At that moment, Colin clapped his hands to calm everyone down and raised his voice.

<b>

“Alright, I’ll look into that properly. Right now, I do think it’s better not to leave that child alone, as Arvin said... Merlin-san.”

“Y-yes?!”

“We’re planning to register at the Adventurers’ Guild from now on. If you don’t mind, would you like to come along?”

“Eh? M-me too...?”

“Yes, if you don’t dislike it... what do you think?”

“I-I want to go! I want to go too!! Please let me join!!”

“...Understood. I’ll get your permission slip. Please wait a moment. Let’s go to the student council.”

<b>

Oh? Karen’s enthusiasm is quite surprising... This is a bit unexpected.

She didn’t seem like the type to come forward much, but I feel like I’m seeing a new side of her.

<b>

With that, Colin and Arvin went to the student council room to apply for the permission slips.

In less than 15 minutes, Arvin returned with permission slips for six people, including Karen, but Colin was apparently caught up with a colleague in the student council room and was being asked questions.

Arvin sighed and told us that it seemed like Colin wouldn’t be freed for a while.

Upon hearing that, everyone’s gaze immediately turned to Arvin, but he was acting oblivious.

Hmm, I guess I’ll have to poke him a bit more during the next match!

<b>

<b>

In the end, we left the academy and boarded the shared carriage well after 1 PM.

<b>

The shared carriage can be boarded from the stop in front of the academy’s main gate.

This is a service that circulates a fixed route within the city of Dekkenbel, similar to a bus in the original world.

It’s about the size of a microbus, and it doesn’t have any spatial compression magic applied, so it’s exactly as big as it looks.

The fare is 20 copper coins per person. There’s a conductor inside the carriage, and you hand over two 10-copper coins to him.

At that time, you’ll be asked for your destination, so you need to tell him where you’re getting off.

The seats inside are arranged facing each other, accommodating about seven to eight people on one side. The seats are upholstered, but they’re not cushioned. They’re better than wooden chairs, but it seems tough for long distances.

<b>

For now, it seems we’ll reach our destination in about 20 minutes with this shared carriage.

I was planning to ask Karen more about various things during the ride. I had already grilled Arvin enough in the cafeteria!

I wanted to hear more details about her relationship with the second son of the Niven family, but all that came out of her mouth were words of gratitude and thanks towards Arvin.

Well, this was probably her way of caring for Arvin, who had been grilled by everyone...

<b>

“Still, I was really happy that you defended me like that...”

<b>

Karen looked down slightly, her cheeks slightly flushed, continuing to express her gratitude towards Arvin.

Along with that, her heated gaze was occasionally directed at Arvin. ...Hey, hey, is she really falling for him?

Is Arvin aware that he’s being sent such a heated gaze? What a troublesome situation! Vivi’s grumpiness is rising steadily in response to this! Seriously!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

I heard that the head of the Niven family, that idiot’s father, is Karen’s guardian.

Moreover, not only that, but he is also providing support for Karen to attend this school.

Karen said, “My uncle has been very helpful to me, and I can’t express my gratitude in words.”

However, just from hearing Arvin’s story, the way this second son treats Karen is not how one would treat a fiancé.

Is this guy just a foolish son who uses his parents' influence to do whatever he wants?!

<b>

In the cafeteria, Anna-Marie quietly informed me that this second son seems to be quite close with a girl from the same hometown.

At that time, among the group of girls who were glancing at us, who were quite noticeable in the cafeteria, that girl was apparently one of them.

She seemed a bit flashy, and her gaze directed mainly at Karen didn’t seem very pleasant.

<b>

Despite Karen being his fiancé, the second son often hangs out with this girl’s friend (?), and he hasn’t treated Karen seriously at all.

Just hearing that made me quite angry! What the hell is that?!

Furthermore, when I asked Karen if she had been treated badly by anyone else, she just smiled awkwardly and said, “It seems it was decided by our parents...”

<b>

As I listened more, the true nature of that Niven brat became clearer and clearer.

<b>

“...Should I crush him?”

“W-wait a minute! This isn’t such a simple matter!”

<b>

Vivi, who had caught my low murmur, opened her mouth in a panic.

I could tell that Vivi, who had been sulking just a moment ago, was gradually directing her anger towards that Niven guy as she listened to Karen’s story.

Even so, it seemed my murmur couldn’t be ignored.

<b>

Suddenly, I looked at the two boys sitting across from me, and for some reason, they were looking at me with terrified expressions.

What’s that about? And why are they sitting with their legs crossed...? Huh!?

W-wait! I didn’t mean it that way!!

How cruel that would be! ...I’m starting to forget what that feels like, but... I understand it as knowledge!!

So! I won’t do such a horrible and vulgar thing!! ...Probably!!!

<b>

<b>

“That's why! I can’t forgive him even more!”

<b>

Since we boarded the carriage, Arvin, who hadn’t said a word, joined the conversation.

<b>

“If she’s your fiancée, isn’t she someone you have to protect?!”

<b>

Oh, Arvin is getting passionate too!

I guess just like me, the more he hears, the more his anger rises!

<b>

“I... if it’s a girl I’ve decided to protect! No matter what happens, I will definitely protect her!!”

<b>

A sigh that sounded like a mix of admiration and awe filled the carriage.

Arvin, who said such a line, looked like he wanted to say that’s why he can’t forgive that guy! He pouted and crossed his arms, glaring straight ahead. I could almost see the words “Kiri!” floating behind him!

Sitting directly across from him, receiving that passionate line head-on, was Vivi, aka Beatrice Croki... who was blushing bright red and flustered, her eyes darting around.

Why is she losing her composure like that?!

<b>

“Y-yeah! Y-you’re right! I-I-I can’t forgive him! N-no way!!”

<b>

Where did your usual calm and collected self go...?

The boldness to say such a youthful and naive line, and the pure heart to accept it head-on!

<b>

“I feel like I just saw the red captain fly away!!”

<b>

Vivi, who is receiving Arvin’s “I will protect you” gaze head-on, looks up at him, her face getting redder and redder.

The space between the two of them seems to be dyed in a gentle color... Is something warm passing between them?!

What is this lovely space?!! I can’t handle this sudden sweet romantic comedy development!!

<b>

Arvin! Just because Vivi’s grumpiness isn’t settling down at all, you’re using such a powerful move...

Even Karen is blushing and looking at Arvin with sparkling eyes! Oh no! Don’t be deceived!!

Mia, Lombard, and I have been spewing sugar from our mouths this whole time!!

<b>

Seriously! Where did the calm and grumpy Vivi from earlier go?!

You little flirty girl!!
