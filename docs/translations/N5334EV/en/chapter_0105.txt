# 93 Beatrice the Grouch

Heeeeeeee, hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ......"

<blank>

Bibi's emotionless voice echoed coldly around the area.

<blank>

Irving ......? Irving ....... Irving!

He's done it, this guy!

After only a week of enrollment, they flagged me right off the bat!

And it was Karen, my roommate!

<blank>

Karen's cheeks are slightly tinted and she looks down at Irving with a slight heat in her eyes, as if she is stealing a glance at him from time to time.

When his eyes meet Irving's, he hurriedly averts his gaze and restlessly moves his hands in a fidgety, sobbing manner, making his gaze swim.

<blank>

Kuso cute, this creature! Konchikushooooo!

<blank>

I never imagined that I would be flagged by my precious roommate on the very first day of school! I never imagined it!

<blank>

Irving is forced to explain after the fact while sitting on his haunches in front of Bibi.

He doesn't seem to understand why he is made to sit on his hands, though!

<blank>

"At ......! You mean you brought him along because you couldn't leave him alone?

"Because, you know, we're related! We're related because we're friends of Susie's. You can't leave us alone! We can't just leave him there, can we?

I know, I know, I know. "...... That's what Irving says! Because he's Irving!

"What the hell? That?

<blank>

Hah~ ...... and everyone (mainly girls!) exhale loudly in a big breath.

The more I hear about it, the more I think it's the Haggard family! Totally!

You can also visit .......

<blank>

"Lainey ...... who's ...... Bouru or Debiru?"

I'm Reilly Niven, Miss. I'm not particularly the kind of person you should be concerned about, miss. ......"

<blank>

And AnnaMary told me, but that doesn't explain it at all, does it?

<blank>

Reilly Niven. I believe he was the second son of the old baronet of Grouse Mill!"

<blank>

Bibi answered instead. You still know a lot of aristocratic information.

Hom, so he is an old aristocrat too.

From what I've heard of Irving, he sounds like a pretty cool guy. ...... Yeah? But a baron is not a very high rank, is it? I'm not sure how he's going to behave.

<blank>

Let's see, Karen ......, am I right, Mr. Marlin?"

"Oh, ......, yes! I'm Karen Marlin."

If you don't mind, I was wondering if you could ...... tell me what your relationship is with the second son of the Niven family?"

<blank>

Colin asked Karen about something that was just on my mind. I think everyone wanted to hear it. That's Colin for you!

<blank>

"Oh, ......, uh, well, Reilly is ............, ......, in case you're wondering, my... ...... and she's my ...... wife and she's ...... and she's ......... I'm so happy to meet you."

「「「「「「「！！！！」」」」」」」

<blank>

Everyone's eyeballs were pulled together! The bomb dropped out of the blue!

<blank>

I'm going to go to ...... and see what Irving is doing! What are you doing? ！！！！"

Ah~~!"

It's not an 'aha' moment!"

<blank>

Bibi is getting furious. Well, that's not too much to ask!

Irving, on the other hand, is saying, "Did I miss it~? He sounds like a lightweight!

Yeah, I'm not Bibi, but I'm a little 'annoyed'! Next time you work out, you can poke me a little harder: ......!

<blank>

"Oh, oh, that's right, but, you know, the parents decided ...... that, you know, it was just a matter of ...... me, you know, that ......"

<blank>

Karen, it's okay ...... and it's a common story, right? but I don't think it's that simple!

Everyone was yelling and screaming at Irving, but Irving was ducking and dodging, and Karen was wincing at the sight of him.

It's pretty chaotic.

<blank>

Then Colin clapped his hands to calm everyone down and raised his voice.

<blank>

'Good, I'll do some neat research on that as well. Right now, I certainly think Irving is right that we shouldn't leave that child alone. ...... Mr. Merlin."

Yes?

Sue and her friends are going to the Adventurers' Guild to register. I was wondering if you would like to go with us.

What? Wow, am I also ......?"

I'm at ......, if you don't mind. What do you think?"

I want to go! I want to go too! I'd love to go with you!

I'll go to ...... and get your furlough. Wait here for a minute. Shall we go to the Arrows?"

<blank>

Hmm? Karen's bite is much better. ...... This is a bit surprising.

I have always found her to be shy and not the type to come forward, but I have seen a new side to her.

<blank>

So Colin and Arrows went to the student council office to apply for permission to go out.

In less than 15 minutes, Arrows came to me with permission slips for six people, including Ms. Cullen, but Colin was caught by a colleague in the student council office and was being interviewed.

It's not going to be released for a while, Arrows told me with a sigh.

Everyone's eyes immediately fell on Irving, but he seemed unconcerned.

Hmmm, after all, I will poke him more in the next stand-up fight!

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

In the end, it was well after 1:00 p.m. when we left the school and boarded a horse-drawn carriage.

<blank>

The horse-drawn carriages can be ridden from the stop in front of the school's main gate.

This is like a transit bus in the original world, which circulates along a fixed route within the city of De Kembel.

In size, it's like a microbus? There is no space compression magic on this one, as one would expect, so it is as big as it looks.

The fare is 20 cents per person, and there is a conductor in the carriage to whom you give two 10-kuple copper coins.

At that time, you will be asked where you want to go, so tell them where you want to get off.

The seats inside are facing each other, with seating for seven to eight people on each side. The seats are upholstered with cloth and not well cushioned. It is better than wooden chairs, but it would be hard to travel long distances in this way.

<blank>

At any rate, this passenger carriage will get us to our destination in about 20 minutes.

On the carriage ride, I was going to ask Karen for more stories. And I hung up on Irving a lot in the cafeteria!

I wanted to ask Karen a little more about her story with the second son of the Niven family, but all that came out of her mouth were words of gratitude and thanks to Irving.

Well, I'm sure this was out of concern for Irving, who was hung up on by everyone. ......

<blank>

Still, it was really nice of you to cover for me like that. ......

<blank>

Ms. Cullen turns her head slightly over, her cheeks slightly tinted, and continues to express her gratitude to Irving.

With it, a glimmer and a feverish eye directed at Irving. ...... oui oui oui, this is not really a fall, right?

I wonder if Irving realizes he's being sent this hot look? It's a problem, isn't it? Even though Bibi's grumpiness quotient is rising with a bang accordingly! Oh, God!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I heard that the head of the Niven family, that is, the father of the idiot in question, is Ms. Cullen's guardian.

Moreover, she says that Karen is even helping her to go to this school.

Karen says, 'My uncle has been very good to me, and I can't express how grateful I am to him.

But just listening to Irving's story, this second son's treatment of Ms. Cullen is not what he does to his forgiving wife.

Is this guy the son of a fool who borrows the authority of his parents and does as he pleases?

<blank>

In the cafeteria, AnnaMarie quietly told me that this second son gets along quite well with the girls from his hometown.

It seems that the girl was one of a group of girls who were glancing at us who were conspicuous in the cafeteria at that time.

He was a bit of a showy kid, and the look he was giving to Ms. Karen, here ...... mainly, was not a very nice one.

<blank>

The second son, even though Karen is his daughter-in-law, often hangs out with this girl's friends (?) and has never had any serious relationship with her. The second son often hangs out with this girl's friends (?) and has never been a serious partner of Karen's.

I was pretty pissed off just hearing that! What's that? I thought!

Furthermore, when I asked Karen if she had done anything else terrible to me, she just laughed in annoyance and said, 'I heard that my parents decided to do this to each other .......'

<blank>

The more I listen to the story, the more I see the nonsense that is the Nantucket boy of the Niven family.

<blank>

I'm going to destroy ............."

Wait a minute! This is not that simple!

<blank>

Hearing my low murmur, Bibi opened her mouth as if in a panic.

Bibi, who had been grumpy and miffed earlier, knew that as she listened to Karen's story, her anger was slowly beginning to turn toward Niven's. She knew that he was the one who had been the one to blame.

Still, it seems that my mutterings were not unheard of.

<blank>

Suddenly, I looked at the two boys sitting across from me, and for some reason they were looking at me with fearful faces.

Why not? And why the inner thighs ...... ha!

I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it like that!

What an outrageous thing that would be! I'm starting to forget a bit about ...... sensibly, even though I'm ............! I understand it in terms of knowledge!

So! I will not do such a terrible and vulgar thing! I mean that I don't do such a terrible vulgar thing! ...... maybe!

<blank>

<blank>

That's why! You can't even forgive me!

<blank>

Irving, who had not spoken a word since the carriage ride, entered the conversation.

<blank>

"If he's your fiancée, isn't that who you're supposed to be protecting?

<blank>

Oh, Irving is kind of hot too!

I wonder if he was as angry as I was the more I listened to him.

<blank>

'I would ......, I would! If it's a girl I've decided to protect! I'll protect you no matter what!

<blank>

A sigh of admiration, like a sigh, like a ...... filled the car.

Irving let loose with such a line, and that's why he can't tolerate him! He looked like he was about to say, "I'm not going to let him get away with it! He was staring straight ahead with his mouth agape and his arms crossed. Behind Irvin's back, there is a drawing of "Snap! behind Irvin's back!

Who sat directly in front of them and received their passionate lines head on.

Beatrice Croquis, aka Bibi, was in the seat in front of ......, her face boiling red and her eyes wandering this way and that.

Why are you so restless?

<blank>

I know! Yes, I know! Yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...! Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't! No, no, no, no, no!

<blank>

Where's your normal, calm and collected antics? ......

The strength to spit out this line, and the purity of heart to accept it head-on!

<blank>

I thought I saw the red captain blow away, saying, "This is youth. ......

<blank>

Bibi, who is directly in front of Irving's "I will protect you" gaze, is looking him up and down and his face is getting redder and redder.

The space between two people staring at each other seems to be tinted with a light color. ...... I think there is something warm and fuzzy going on between the two of them!

What is this lovely space? I can't do this, what is it? This sudden development of a very sweet romantic comedy!

<blank>

Irving! Just because Bibi's moods won't go away, we're going to have to use this kind of forceful blow .......

Even Karen is staring at Irving with her cheeks tinted and eyes sparkling! Oh, no! Don't be fooled!

Me, Mia and Lombardo have been spitting sugar out of our mouths for a while now!

<blank>

I don't get it! Where the hell is that calm and grumpy Bibi who was here just a few minutes ago!

Oh, no! Choroine!
