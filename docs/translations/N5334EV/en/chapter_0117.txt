# 105 Duel at Noon

The second sons of the Niven family look quite surprised at Irving's declaration, don't they? Did they really not expect Irving to accept the duel?

No, that's not true, after all that agitation.

Well, Irving didn't accept the duel because the second son encouraged him to do so! It was because I intimidated him!

<blank>

Irving ......, don't pull any punches, get things done quickly, and don't add or subtract too much."

"............ is really raising the bar, isn't it?"

<blank>

I'm going to put some pressure on you anyway, just to make sure you don't get the best of me! Well, since you're going to fight, show them your full strength!

If the content was half-baked, the women of AMCAM would not allow it, right?

<blank>

Is this the right venue for the event?"

<blank>

As I was putting pressure on Irving like that, I heard a joyful voice that sounded like a bell rolling.

The mass of people who had gathered around this table as onlookers pulled to the left and right as if the sea were breaking, opening the way.

Then, there was a person coming toward us with a group of people around him, carrying a full-blown rose on his back, making the petals of the flower dance around the area with every step he took.

It was Caroline Goldberg, the former duchess herself.

<blank>

Caroline-sama approaches us on the flower aisle opened by the students, wearing a glamorous and elegant aura.

Every time I move my legs forward, it seems as if sparkling and shimmering particles of light are flying through the air with the petals. Of course, this is an illusion!

<blank>

"Oh, hi, Carrie, how are you?"

Colin says, "Have a nice day, too. So? Has the gala started yet?"

Already! You came down from the salon to the dining room, which is unusual, so I wondered what was going on. ......"

I couldn't stand still when I heard the event was about to start!

'What are you talking about, Miss Goldberg? You can't come in here with such a playful attitude. ......"

Oh, Fritz and Nancy! It's lunchtime. Thanks again and good luck."

"......! Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Caroline."

"Oh, oh, I appreciate your concern ......, no, no! That's not what I meant!"

<blank>

There was someone who casually approached Caroline. It was our Miss Colin.

And, after all, this bespectacled senior is the hardworking one.

I can tell from their current exchange alone that they are usually pushed around by Caroline-sama.

Well, I don't think there are many people who can control him!

<blank>

I see Irvin is also a bit taken back when he sees the two senior bespectacled guys getting tougher and tougher.

Hmm? Are you surprised to see the second son seeing the older girl with the smaller glasses? They were there from the beginning. You didn't even know they were there?

Well, you're a small person, so it would be rude to say .......

<blank>

"How have you been the other day, Sue? How are you?"

<blank>

Looking at Irving, whose face was twitching, with a sideways glance of amusement, Caroline turned her feet toward me and called out.

I will leave immediately and greet you with a curtsey.

As I got up from my seat, Bibi, Mia, and Karen stood up and bowed their heads after me.

<blank>

"Good day, Mr. Goldberg. ......

<blank>

Before I could finish my greeting, however, Caroline stepped forward and brought her face close to the tip of my nose.

<blank>

It's Carrie! Carrie! You promised you'd call me that. Sue!

Ah, so, but here it is: ......"

Carrie, right?"

"Oh, uh, Caroline, it's Caroline. ......"

Carrie."

Carrie, Carrie, .......

<blank>

Awww, you're so close to my face! Too close! There's no way I can resist if I'm approached with such pressure!

Caroline sa ...... not you, Master Carrie! is still a dangerous sister!

<blank>

"...... heh, good girl Sue."

"Fugimyu?!"

"Really? When did you become so friendly with my Sue?"

'Mmmmmm, yes? We're friends now!"

<blank>

I was hugged by Master Carrie, and I made a funny sound! and Carrie-sama hugged me, and a strange voice came out!

Kara, who saw this, squinted her eyes a little and asked Carrie-sama about it, but Carrie-sama was not intimidated by this and smiled happily.

Not only Kara, but also Jessica, Alicia, and even Mia are emitting frozen vibrations!

I am amazed at Carrie-sama's boldness in defying them! Even the sisters that Master Carey brought along are all rolling their eyes, you know?

<blank>

Oh, God! Carrie? I wish you'd stop making fun of us so much."

I didn't mean it that way. So, Colin's running the process?"

<blank>

Colin, flapping the papers in his hand, called out to Carrie as if to admonish her.

When Carrie sees this, she turns away from me with her hand on my cheek and walks around the table to get closer to Colin.

<blank>

The reaction of those who have seen Master Carey's behavior up to this point has been mixed.

They seem to have a variety of thoughts and feelings inside, creating a complex human pattern.

I can see the tremendous presence of Carrie-sama. I wonder how much influence he has in this school. ......

Carrie, on the other hand, looks very happy and smiling as she heads toward Colin with her companions in tow.

<blank>

For now, we have confirmed that both sides are willing to fight the duel. Now all that remains is for both parties to submit their applications, and if the committee approves, we can begin immediately.

Well! Lovely!"

"I hope the motive for the 'duel' is 'to protect each other's pride'?"

I think it's a good idea. It's a terribly silly reason, but it's a classic motivation for a 'duel'."

"You're okay with that, aren't you? That's what motives are for, isn't it?"

<blank>

Harsh! Both Master Carrie and Colin are very harsh indeed!

While filling out the forms that Colin had with him, he exchanges this kind of conversation with Mr. Carey.

Kara and the others who were listening to this smiled bitterly, the second son's face twitched, and Irving let out a sigh as if he had given up.

The second son, who had been rough from start to finish, was not rough with Colin, Carrie and the other seniors.

I guess these misbehaving people know about Carrie-sama. Even Miss Lurie, when Mr. Carey approaches, grabs the second son by the sleeve and looks somewhat pale.

<blank>

<blank>

Hey, Haggard, are you seriously going to accept this duel? Are you seriously going to take this duel?"

I'm not serious. I've already declared it.

"I can't believe you'd take a stunt like that seriously ......"

No, I don't really care about that stuff."

Then why did you take it?

If I had to guess, I'd say ...... saves lives? Is that it?"

What's that?"

<blank>

<blank>

Now we have to get the signatures of both parties. Yes, both of you, fill in your names here."

<blank>

When Colin finishes arranging the paperwork, he puts it in front of Irving and his second son, asking them to sign here.

The second son took the document as if snatching it and signed it roughly.

Irving signs, reluctantly but resignedly.

<blank>

You say, "...... Yes, good. All I need to do now is get approval. Carrie, can you do that for me?"

Of course. ...... yes, is that okay?"

Thank you, Carrie. Now all we need is the Chairman's signature and we're done."

<blank>

...... aren't you two working too fast?"

Oh, Anthony! Just in time."

Well, Mr. Chairman! What a coincidence."

You both know what you're talking about, don't you? You're sure of it, aren't you?"

I don't know what you're talking about, Anthony."

Not at all, Mr. Chairman. We're just going about our business as usual, you know?"

<blank>

As they were putting away their papers, they were approached by Mr. Anthony Reinberger, the student body president.

The girls around me who noticed Mr. Leinberger suddenly became very colorful.

That's right. After all, he is the most popular chairman among girls!

<blank>

But still, this whole area has gone up a notch in face value.

Of course, Carrie, who is the most beautiful girl in the school, is at the center of it all, but the ladies who accompany her are all beautiful as well.

Four seniors and two maids. These maids are the ones who were in the salon at the tea party the other day. Like our AnnaMarie, I guess they must be the attendants of Carrie-sama.

I knew there must be a duke's family, and they must have two exclusive maids. These maids are naturally beautiful!

<blank>

Furthermore, the student council, led by Mr. Rheinberger, are all beautifully dressed! It's as if a pillar of light is rising all around here!

<blank>

Mr. Rheinberger looked at the two men who were processing the documents as if they were flowing, but the two men were being passed around without a care in the world.

But still, Colin and Lady Carrie, I knew they were friends, I had a feeling that they were friends, because they were breathing so well together.

Oh! But Mr. Leinberger! Was he a hard worker too?

I mean, not only Master Carrie, but also Colin is on the wielding side?

<blank>

Chairman! I apologize! We are here and we have mismanaged the situation!"

I'm fine. Don't worry about it, Fritz and Nancy did a great job."

I am! It is my own fault that I let this happen!"

They've been great with me. They're always taking care of me. I really appreciate it.

'What a waste of words, sir! Mr. Chairman!

<blank>

Why is it that the "boss working with his subordinate" looks like "two victims comforting each other" when it is supposed to be "a picture of a boss working with his subordinate"?

<blank>

Anthony! Can you please sign your name in the book as soon as possible?"

<blank>

Not paying any attention to the student council's interactions, Mr. Carey presented the documents to Mr. Rheinberger.

<blank>

I don't mind ......, but it looks like the others haven't been approved yet. But it looks like the others haven't been approved yet?"

I'm the chairman of the council. The others can review it later.

I see, that's true. So, do you know where you're going to duel?

The third hall should be open at this time. I have already prepared an application for its use.

...... hmmm, but wouldn't that eat into my afternoon classes if I started now?"

"Oh, Anthony! If we don't start now, when will we start? Right? Hey, honey, it won't take long, will it? It won't take long, will it?

"! ...... yes... I thought you didn't need 5 minutes."

<blank>

When Carrie-sama suddenly asked him a question, Irving was a bit jumpy for a moment, but he didn't show any sign of being so, and answered with a shrug, putting his hand on his chest.

<blank>

What's with the knightly behavior? You're Irving! You're not that kind of character!

<blank>

Some of the girls onlookers who were watching the event were sighing and saying, "Oh, .......

Don't be fooled! This is Irving, remember?

<blank>

"Hey, fuck you ......, fuck you ......."

<blank>

My second son, who was watching this, was twitching with even more blue streaks on his face.

I know, right? Irving told me I had five minutes to finish.

But hey, don't do it, okay? Keep it down, okay?

If you get out of line in front of Carrie and Goldberg, you'll really get yourself into trouble, won't you?

The senior bespectacled man thought so, too, putting his hand on the second son's shoulder and whispering something softly in his ear.

Then the second son shook his shoulders and looked as if he were biting down on a bitter bug.

<blank>

"Good for you. You're very promising."

"...... thank you."

<blank>

Who is this guy? This guy.

It doesn't look like Irving at all! Is this the result of Bibi's training after all?

Well, it is true that I would be annoyed if he talks to Carrie in his usual manner!

<blank>

Then, Mr. Rheinberger quietly walked up to Irving and his second son, who was spilling his murderous guts.

<blank>

We can talk about it another day, but ......, are you sure you want to do this?"

No problem.

I'll beat you right here and now!"

"...... Okay, all right! Then we'll take care of the rest. Miss Cloud, would you be okay with that?"

Huh?" Oh, ha, hi! Thank you very much for your time. Mr. Leinberger."

<blank>

After confirming their intentions, Mr. Rheinberger asked me to confirm them as well.

Well, it is true that Irving is from Amcam!

As the daughter of the Cloud family, I have no choice but to ask you for your cooperation, since those of us at AMCAM are causing trouble for you!

<blank>

'Now this duel is officially accepted! The Student Council Executive Board will take charge from here on out! Nancy, please prepare the third auditorium for use."

Yes, sir.

The permission to use the auditorium was already taken care of by the excellent secretary of the student council."

Thank you, Mr. Chairman."

"I would like Fritz to be the facilitator and referee, can you do that?"

Leave it to me!"

We need to get the emergency personnel ready as well. Hurry up and contact the theology department at ......."

I'm here, Anthony."

Oh, Jessica. You're here. Can you help me out here?"

I'll take care of it. It's just the right opportunity, I'll use it for my sophomore practicum. Theology Department! Gather the students from the medical team! It's an emergency exercise!

"Hmmm...excellent. That's Jessica Karloff, the 'Saint of the Iron Claw'."

"...... a bit?"

Oh, sorry. ......."

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Then they left the cafeteria accompanied by Fritz-senpai, a big senior with glasses from the executive committee.

<blank>

After that, it was already a big move by the students! The students began to move to the third auditorium. ' was the only unvoiced voice that echoed through the cafeteria as the students began to move to the third auditorium.

I wonder if the students at the school are hungry for entertainment? The excitement is almost enough to make us want to pull out of our seats.

<blank>

The third hall is a multi-purpose hall located on the north side of the school building, as you exit the west exit of the cafeteria and proceed toward the main school building.

It is an old, massive stone structure, one of those built in the old days when the Temple Authority administered this land.

<blank>

The hall on the first floor of the auditorium, which is used for various events and gatherings, has been cleared of all seating, revealing a polished, mirror-like finish on the marble floor.

There is also seating upstairs, Colin told me, with three rows of seats that can accommodate more than 100 people.

The building is long from east to west, about 15 meters wide and about twice as long, or about 30 meters. It is about the size of an elementary school gymnasium.

The main difference from the gymnasium is the interior decoration. As the building was formerly related to a temple, it has a solemn yet calm structure.

The ceiling had a large round skylight that flooded the hall with warm noon light.

<blank>

As students rushed into the auditorium one after another, the two protagonists of this duel also appeared in the center of the hall.

They were wearing something over their uniforms.

Is it a leather armor, like a thick, short vest for the body?

He wears gloves on his hands, boots on his legs, and elbow pads and knee pads.

On his head, he wore what looked like the headgear worn by white-colored boxers.

And in each of their hands is a wooden sword like a broadsword. Does this mean they are fully equipped?

There are people, probably from the student council, who are checking the state of their equipment.

<blank>

But still, the noise from the students who have come to watch the game is amazing. The student council seemed to be asking them if there was anything wrong with their equipment, but I could hardly hear them. How excited are they?

<blank>

This time I'm going to show you what I can do! Prepare yourself!

......, I'll do my best."

Kettle on!"

<blank>

Okay?" Guys, we're going to go over this one last time."

<blank>

After getting ready, Irving and his second son stood facing the center of the room, while Fritz senior faced them and called out to them.

<blank>

This is a "duel. There are no rules like a match, such as a decision, a first-pass, or a time limit. You can continue until your opponent admits defeat or becomes incapacitated. Do you understand?

<blank>

I guess this is why Fritz senior stopped me from having a duel. I think he wants to say that unlike a match or something, you can get seriously injured. Yes, he looks strict, but I guess he is quite gentle.

<blank>

Of course, if the duel is deemed too dangerous to continue, it will be stopped immediately. In that case, we will decide who wins. Is that clear?"

Yeah, I don't care! I don't care."

Roger that.

'Well, Reilly Niven! Irving Haggard! The duel between the two will be witnessed here by Fritz Rheinbard, the executive director of the student council! Both sides, ready yourselves!

<blank>

In the center of the hall, two people standing about five meters apart take their positions at the voice of their senpai.

The second son held his sword with both hands straight up and held it at his right side. That's one of the basic stances of swordsmanship.

Irving, on the other hand, held his right sword as if he carried it on his shoulder and thrust his left hand forward. Hmmm...he's going to say, "Leave my head.

<blank>

Are you ready for this?" ............Hajime!"

Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

<blank>

At Fritz senior's signal to begin, the second son starts running briskly, sword drawn and screaming.

I guess he's going to keep up the momentum and slam the swinging wooden sword into Irving ......, that's what he's going to do.

<blank>

You're already so far beyond screwed up.

His hips are not falling, his leg carry is uneven, his body axis is shaky, and above all, his legs are slow! Why are you taking so long for a distance of only 5 meters? I can almost hear the sound of thudding footsteps, can't you?

<blank>

Irving, on the other hand, is waiting for his second son to approach, not moving an inch.

The left hand, lightly held open, is thrust forward and not moving a twitch.

<blank>

The second son finally arrived at his own spacing, where he swung his wooden sword further ......, and from there, jumped up?

Why did you jump? Why did you jump up to stop your momentum of running there, kicking the floor with a dadaunce?

The first time I saw him, he was a little bit nervous, but he was still able to swing his wooden sword down at Irving.

I mean, isn't there a lot of room for maneuver? Aim for the body! I'm going to be told, "Aim for the body, the body!

Furthermore, the sword stripes that were swung down were so slow and sluggish that even an insect seemed to be stuck on them.

<blank>

Why is it so bad? On the contrary, I'm impressed! How can an academy admit people like this?

Sure, we are constantly told to not compare ourselves to the people of AMCAM! This is ......, isn't it? Not too much, is it?

<blank>

For the most part, Irving is already a "Sword Fighter," which is his basic job title.

In contrast, new students are, at best, "Novice," so the difference is obvious.

The combat value of an ordinary "Novice" is around 0.5 at best. If you are not even a Novice, 0.2 is good enough.

And even though Irvin and his colleagues are called basic occupations, their combat values are not within the standard values!

How can you challenge Irving with such confidence?

<blank>

<blank>

The second man's wooden sword aims at Irving's shoulder, probably intending to swing it in an exaggerated manner. The wooden sword closes in, but Irving does not move an inch.

The second son's wooden sword, aimed at Irving, swung down at Irving's neck.

<blank>

At that moment, Irving's left hand, which had not moved slightly before, moved slightly inward.

Then, in the space of a breath, that left hand is vigorously turned outward, swung, and opened.

A clank! sounded as if a hard object had been slammed into the area.

<blank>

That was the sound of Irving's left back fist flicking loudly off the belly of a wooden sword swung by his second son.

<blank>

The second son's wooden sword is suddenly flung outward in an unusual trajectory, and even his own body is pulled by the momentum and swept to the right.

I don't think my second son's eyes widened, but I don't think he even understood what was going on. In fact, the fact that he was able to react at this point by just opening his eyes is probably something to be praised.

<blank>

Irving turned his body to match the movement of his open left hand and swung the wooden sword in his right hand toward his second son's left side.

After the sound of the wind whistling in the wind was heard, a dull impact sound echoed around the area.

That's the sound of Irving putting the belly of his sword into the second son's side.

<blank>

Ka-kaaaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii?

<blank>

He spits out a strange sound from his mouth that I'm not quite sure how he got it out, and his second son blasts off toward the wall.

After flying about 4 to 5 meters, twisting and turning in mid-air, he landed on his face, then spun around and rolled again, slamming into a wall and finally coming to a stop.

<blank>

Oh, this is the one I often give Irving when he comes in with a sloppy strike during a stand-up fight.

When I do this, I strike out with the hilt of the sword I hold in my left hand at Irving's sword belly as he swings down, then turn my wrist and slam my sword belly into Irving's side.

Irvin then blew up 14 to 5 meters and slammed into a wall and said, "Ow! Ow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and rolls around screaming. ......

What about people outside the village? I told you to adjust it properly, and well, you wouldn't do it to ......, would you?

<blank>

Oh, my leg jerked. At least he's alive.

<blank>

That's it! Irving Haggard, the winner!"

<blank>

As the senior referee declared victory, a roar of cheers from the students echoed through the auditorium, which had been quiet and still.

Yeah, so far, about 6 seconds from the start.

It's a 'second kill', Irving!

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Reilly! Reilly! Are you okay? Hey? Reilly! Come on, Reilly!

Get away from me, freshman! Hurry up and take off your protective gear! Check his condition at the same time!

<blank>

Bruising around the right orbit. Unconscious, but breathing is stable. Pulse, one, two, three. ......"

Crack fractures are observed on the left eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs!"

<blank>

No damage to the orbit, zygomatic or nasal bones? There's no hemorrhaging inside the skull either.

Let's go, seniors! Karloff senior! Right hand to ......"

'Oh my gosh, the force of the bullet must have dislodged it. ...... We need to realign the carpals. I don't see anything wrong with your radius or ulna, do you? There is damage to the ligaments, so be aware of that as well when you do the 'healing.'"

Yes!"

You should graft the ribs," he said. There is no misalignment of the bones, so just apply the 'healing' of the graft and you should be fine.

Yes.

And you have 'healing' on your face. There is no major damage to the skull, but there is some damage to the orbital area and cheekbones, so be aware of that.

Yes."

Come on! I'm going to put you on a gurney and take you to the infirmary. As quietly as possible."

""Yes!""

<blank>

"............"

You don't have to cry either. ...... Well, I think you'll have a bruise or two for a couple of days. Go on, follow him."

"...... Yes."

<blank>

<blank>

'Cracked bones but no damage to internal organs,' or ....... No bones cracked, no organs damaged. ...... quite a touch, Irving?"
