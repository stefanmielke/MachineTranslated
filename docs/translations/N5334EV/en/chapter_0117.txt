# Chapter 105: Duel at Noon

Upon hearing Irvin's declaration, the second sons of the Niven family look quite surprised, don't they? Did they really not think Irvin would take the duel seriously?

No, that can't be the case, right? After all, they provoked him to that extent.

Well, it's not like Irvin accepted the duel because he was provoked by the second son! It was because I intimidated him!

<b>

"Irvin... do not hold back at all, finish it swiftly, and on top of that, make sure you do not misjudge the level of your strength."

"........... Aren't you raising the bar a bit high?"

<b>

Since we're at it, I'll pressure him a bit more! Yes, if we're going to fight, show your full strength!

If it's something half-hearted, the women of Amukam won't forgive you, you know?!

<b>

"Is this venue for the event alright?"

<b>

While I was putting pressure on Irvin like that, a cheerful voice like a rolling bell reached my ears.

The crowd of onlookers gathered around this table parted as if the sea were splitting, creating a path.

There, a lady carrying a full bloom of roses on her back stepped forward, and with every step she took, the petals danced and scattered around her, creating a vision of beauty as she approached us, accompanied by several attendants.

It was none other than Lady Caroline Goldberg, the former duchess's daughter.

<b>

As Lady Caroline approached, she radiated a glamorous and elegant aura, walking down the flower path created by the students.

With each step she took, sparkling particles of light seemed to dance in the air along with the petals. Of course, it was an illusion!

<b>

"Oh, Carrie, good day to you!"

"Colin, good day to you too. So? Has the event not started yet?"

"Well! I thought it was unusual for you to come down from the salon to the dining hall, so I was wondering what was going on..."

"Well, I heard the event was about to start, and I just couldn't sit still anymore!"

"What are you saying, Miss Goldberg! You can't just come here half-heartedly..."

"Oh, Fritz and Nancy! It's quite a lot of work for you, even though it's lunchtime. Thank you as always, and keep up the good work!"

"......! I-I am honored, Lady Caroline."

"Ah, ah, I appreciate your concern... n-no! That's not what I meant!!"

<b>

Someone casually called out to Lady Caroline. It was our Colin sister.

And indeed, this bespectacled senior seems to be quite the hard worker.

Just from this exchange, one can tell that she is usually being tossed around by Lady Caroline.

Well, normally, I can't imagine many people being able to handle her!

<b>

Irvin, too, seems a bit taken aback as he watches the two bespectacled seniors struggling.

Huh? Is the second son surprised to see the smaller bespectacled senior? She was here from the beginning, though. Did he not notice her presence?

Well, she is quite petite... but saying that might be rude.

<b>

"It's been a while, Sue. How have you been?"

<b>

While watching Irvin's face twitch in amusement, Lady Caroline turned her feet toward me and called out.

I immediately stood up and greeted her with a courtesy.

As I stood up, Bibi, Mia, and Karen also rose and bowed their heads in sequence.

<b>

"I am delighted to see you, Lady Goldberg..."

<b>

However, before I could finish my greeting, Lady Caroline stepped forward and brought her face close to mine.

<b>

"Call me Carrie! Carrie! We promised to call each other that, right, Sue?"

"Uh, but, here..."

"Carrie, right?"

"Ah, um, Ca-Caroline..."

"Carrie."

"Ca-Carri... e, ma'am."

<b>

Ahh, her face is so close! Too close! With this kind of pressure, I can't possibly resist!

Lady Caroline... no, Carrie! is definitely a dangerous woman!

<b>

"... Hehe, good girl, Sue."

"Fugyumyuu?!"

"Oh? You've become quite friendly with our Sue, haven't you?"

"Hehe, yes! We became friends!"

<b>

Squeezed tight! Carrie hugged me, and a strange sound escaped my mouth!

Seeing this, Carla narrowed her eyes slightly and questioned Carrie, but Carrie just laughed happily without flinching.

Not just Carla, but Jessica, Alicia, and even Mia were emitting a freezing aura!

Carrie's composure in the face of that is impressive! The ladies she brought with her are all wide-eyed too?!

<b>

"Come on! Carrie? I wish you'd stop teasing everyone so much."

"Oh, Colin, I didn't mean to do that! So, are you the one handling the procedures?"

<b>

Colin waved the documents in her hand while admonishing Carrie.

Upon seeing that, Carrie placed her hand on my cheek, stepped away from me, and moved closer to Colin around the table.

<b>

The reactions of those watching Carrie's actions varied.

It seemed various emotions and thoughts were swirling within them, creating a complex tapestry of human feelings.

You could sense the incredible presence of Carrie. Just how much influence does she hold in this academy...?

Meanwhile, Carrie was approaching Colin with a genuinely cheerful smile, accompanied by her entourage.

<b>

"For now, we have confirmed both parties' willingness to duel. All that remains is for the individuals to submit their application forms, and once the committee approves, we can start right away."

"Oh my! How wonderful!"

"Is the motive for the 'duel' to 'protect each other's pride' alright?"

"That should be fine, I suppose? It's a rather trivial reason, but it's a classic motive for a 'duel'."

"Is that alright with you two? The motive is just that, isn't it?"

<b>

How harsh! Both Carrie and Colin are incredibly harsh!!

As Colin filled out the documents, they engaged in this kind of conversation.

Carla and the others exchanged wry smiles, the second son's face twitched, and Irvin sighed as if resigned.

Even the second son, who had been rough throughout, was not acting coarse around Colin and Carrie.

Even these ruffians seem to know who Carrie is. Even that Ruri girl, when Carrie approached, grabbed the second son's sleeve and looked a bit pale.

<b>

<b>

"Hey, Haggard. Are you seriously going to accept this duel?"

"Seriously or not, I declared it."

"I can't believe you took that provocation seriously..."

"No, I didn't really care about that."

"Then why did you accept?!"

"If I had to say... to save a life? I guess?"

"What does that even mean?"

<b>

<b>

"Next, we need to get their signatures. Alright, both of you, please sign here."

<b>

After finishing the paperwork, Colin thrust the document in front of Irvin and the second son, asking them to sign.

The second son snatched the document and signed it roughly.

Irvin signed it reluctantly, as if resigned.

<b>

"... Alright, that's good. All that's left is to get approval. Carrie, can I ask you to handle that?"

"Of course. ... Is this alright?"

"Thank you, Carrie. Once we have the chairman's signature, it will be complete."

<b>

"... You two are working too fast, aren't you?"

"Oh, Anthony! Just at the right time."

"Well, chairman! What a coincidence."

"You both know what you're doing, right? You're being deliberate, aren't you?"

"I don't really understand what you're saying, Anthony."

"Not at all, chairman. We're just doing our jobs, you know?"

<b>

The one who spoke to the two of them, who were quickly tidying up the documents, was the student council president, Anthony Reinberger.

The surrounding girls, noticing Reinberger, immediately became excited.

Of course, that's to be expected. After all, he is the most popular chairman among the girls!

<b>

Still, the attractiveness level in this area just skyrocketed.

Of course, Lady Carrie, who boasts the academy's most beautiful looks, is at the center, but her accompanying ladies are all beauties too.

Four seniors and two maids. These maids were the ones who were in the salon during the tea party the other day. They are likely also attendants of Lady Carrie, just like our Anna Mary.

As expected of a ducal family, they have two dedicated maids. These maids are certainly beautiful too!

<b>

Moreover, led by Reinberger, the members of the student council are all good-looking too! It's like a pillar of light has risen in this area!

<b>

Reinberger cast a suspicious glance at the two who were processing the documents fluidly, but the two simply brushed it off.

By the way, Colin and Carrie were indeed friends; they seemed to have a great rapport, which made me feel that way.

Ah! But Reinberger! Was this person also someone who had to struggle?!

Wait, is Carrie not the only one who is the one doing the tossing around? 

<b>

"Chairman! I apologize! While we were here, such a blunder occurred!"

"That's alright. Don't worry about it. Fritz and Nancy did well."

"But! It was my lack of virtue that caused this situation!"

"That's not true. You two have been doing well. You've always been dealing with troublesome matters for me. I truly appreciate it."

"Such kind words! Chairman!"

<b>

Why is it, even though it should be the scene of 'a boss rewarding their subordinates', it somehow looks like 'victims comforting each other'?

<b>

"Anthony! Could you please sign quickly?"

<b>

Ignoring the exchanges among the student council members, Carrie thrust the document at Reinberger.

<b>

"... I don't mind. But it seems the approval from the others is still pending?"

"I'm the chairperson of the review committee. The others can approve later without any problem."

"I see, that makes sense. So, have you decided on the location for the duel?"

"The third lecture hall should be available at this time. The application form has already been prepared."

"... Hmm, but if we start now, won't it cut into the afternoon classes?"

"Oh, Anthony! If we don't start now, when will we? Right? Hey, you. It shouldn't take long, right?"

"! ... Yes. I don't think it will take more than five minutes."

<b>

Irvin, who was suddenly put on the spot by Carrie, seemed startled for a moment, but he didn't show it and calmly placed his hand on his chest as he answered.

<b>

What kind of knightly behavior is that? For Irvin! You're not that kind of character!

<b>

Among the onlookers, there were girls who sighed in admiration, as if they were taken in by him.

Don't be fooled! This is Irvin, you know?!

<b>

"Y-you... don't mess with me..."

<b>

The second son, who was watching, was twitching even more, his face turning blue.

Well, that's to be expected. Irvin just said he would finish it in five minutes.

But hey, stop it, okay? Keep it in check!

Maybe the bespectacled senior thought the same, as she placed her hand on the second son's shoulder and whispered something in his ear.

At that, the second son trembled and made a face as if he had bitten into a bitter bug.

<b>

"Alright, you. I think I can expect a lot from you."

"...... I am honored."

<b>

Who is this? 

This is not Irvin at all! Is this the result of Bibi's training?!

Well, it’s true that it would be troublesome if he spoke to Carrie with his usual attitude!

<b>

Then, quietly approaching Irvin and the second son, who were both exuding killing intent, was Reinberger.

<b>

"We could postpone it to another day, but... are you both okay with this?"

"No problem."

"I'll smash you right here and now!!"

"...... Alright, understood! Then we'll leave the rest to us. Miss Cloud, is that okay with you?"

"Eh? Ah, y-yes! I apologize for the trouble, but please take care of it, Chairman."

<b>

After confirming the intentions of the two, Reinberger, for some reason, turned to me and asked for my confirmation.

Well, it's true that Irvin is from Amukam!

Since the people of Amukam are causing trouble for everyone, as the daughter of the Cloud family, I have no choice but to ask for your understanding, right?!

<b>

"This duel is now officially accepted! From here on, the student council executive will take charge! Nancy, please prepare for the use of the third lecture hall."

"Understood."

"The permission for the use of the lecture hall has already been processed by our excellent secretary."

"Thank you, Chairman."

"I'd like to ask Fritz to handle the proceedings and judging. Can I count on you?"

"Leave it to me!"

"We also need to prepare emergency personnel. Quickly contact the theology department..."

"I'll handle it, Anthony."

"Oh, Jessica. You were here. Can I count on you for this?"

"Leave it to me. This is a good opportunity, so I'll use it for the second-year practicals. Theology department! Gather the medical team students! Emergency practicals!!"

"Hmm, wonderful. As expected of the 'Holy Woman of the Iron Claw', Jessica Karoff."

"... Excuse me?"

"Oh, my apologies..."

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

After that, the two were led out of the dining hall by the large bespectacled senior, Fritz.

<b>

What followed was a massive movement of students! A soundless cheer echoed in the dining hall as the students began to move towards the third lecture hall.

Are the academy students really starving for entertainment? Their level of excitement is almost overwhelming.

<b>

The third lecture hall is located to the north of the main building, accessible by exiting the dining hall's west entrance and heading towards the main building.

It is an old, solid stone building, one of those built when the temple office managed this land long ago.

This hall, which is used for various events and gatherings, has had all its seats removed and polished, revealing a marble floor that shines like a mirror.

There are seats on the second floor, and Colin told me that the three rows can accommodate over 100 people.

The building is long from east to west, with an interior width of about 15 meters and a length of roughly double that, about 30 meters? It's about the size of an elementary school gym.

The main difference from a gym is the internal decoration. Being a former temple-related building, it has a majestic yet calming design.

There is a large round skylight in the ceiling, allowing warm light to flood the hall.

<b>

As students pressed into the hall one after another, the two main characters of this duel also appeared in the center of the hall.

They were wearing something over their uniforms.

It looked like thick, short leather armor, like a vest.

They wore gloves on their hands, boots on their legs, and had elbow and knee pads.

On their heads, they wore something resembling the headgear that boxers wear, in white.

And in their hands, each held a wooden sword resembling a broadsword. Is this what they call being fully equipped?

Probably the student council members, there were people checking their equipment.

<b>

Still, the noise from the students watching is incredible. It seems that a member of the student council is asking them if there are any issues with their equipment, but I can hardly hear anything. Just how excited are they?!

<b>

"This time, I'll show you the power of me, the great one! Be prepared!!"

"...... Ah, I'll do my best."

"Ha!!"

<b>

"Alright, you two, I'll confirm one last time."

<b>

Having finished their preparations, Irvin and the second son stood in the center as senior Fritz addressed them.

<b>

"This is a 'duel'. There are no rules like judging, first to score, or time limits. It will continue until one side admits defeat or becomes unable to fight. Do you understand?"

<b>

This must be why senior Fritz was stopping them from having a duel. He probably wanted to warn them that unlike a match, serious injuries could occur. He seems strict in appearance, but he must be quite kind.

<b>

"Of course, if it is judged to be too dangerous, the duel will be stopped immediately. In that case, we will determine the outcome. Understood?"

"Ah! I don't mind."

"Understood."

"Then, Reilly Niven! Irvin Haggard! The student council executive, Fritz Reinbard, will witness your duel here! Both of you, take your positions!!"

<b>

The two, standing about five meters apart in the center of the hall, took their stances at the senior's command.

The second son held his sword straight up with both hands on the right side. It's one of the basic stances in swordsmanship.

In contrast, Irvin held his right sword over his shoulder and extended his left hand forward. Hmm, it looks like he's about to say something like "leave your neck exposed."

<b>

"Are you ready?.......... Begin!!"

"Uraaaaaaahhhhhh!!"

<b>

With senior Fritz's signal to start, the second son swung his sword overhead and shouted as he charged forward with great momentum.

With that momentum, he intended to bring down the wooden sword on Irvin...

<b>

This is just too much.

His waist is too low, his footwork is all over the place, his body axis is wobbling, and above all, his feet are slow! Why is he taking so long to cover just five meters? You can almost hear the thudding footsteps!

<b>

In contrast, Irvin stood still, waiting for the second son to approach.

His left hand, slightly open, was extended forward without moving an inch.

<b>

Finally, when the second son reached his range, he swung his wooden sword overhead again... and then, did he jump?

Why did he jump?! Why did he stop the momentum he had built up to kick off the ground like that?!

And then, he swung the raised wooden sword down toward Irvin.

What can I say, isn't he wide open? Someone might say to aim for the body!

Moreover, the downward sword strike was so weak and slow that it seemed like a bug could land on it.

<b>

How can it be this bad? I'm honestly impressed! Is it really possible to get into the academy with this level of skill?!

Sure, I've been told countless times that you can't compare with the people of Amukam! But this is... come on, isn't it a bit much?

<b>

For starters, Irvin has already become a basic class 'Sword Fighter'.

In contrast, the new students are at best 'Novices', so the difference is evident.

The combat value of a typical 'Novice' is usually around 0.5. If they haven't even reached that, having 0.2 is considered good.

Moreover, even though Irvin and the others are basic classes, their combat values are above the standard!

How can he come at Irvin with such confidence?!

<b>

<b>

The second son's wooden sword aimed at Irvin's shoulder, intending to swing diagonally. As the wooden sword approached, Irvin remained completely still.

The wooden sword swung down toward Irvin's neck.

<b>

At that moment, Irvin's left hand, which had been completely still, moved slightly inward.

Then, in a single motion, his left hand swung outward, striking and opening.

With a loud crack, a sound echoed as if something hard had been struck.

<b>

That was the sound of Irvin powerfully deflecting the second son's wooden sword with his left backhand.

<b>

The second son's wooden sword was suddenly deflected outward at an unusual angle, and he was pulled along by the momentum, flowing to the right.

The second son seemed to widen his eyes, but he probably couldn't comprehend what was happening. In fact, the fact that he was able to react with widened eyes at this point might be something to commend.

<b>

As Irvin turned his body in sync with the movement of his left hand, he swung the wooden sword in his right hand toward the second son's left side.

A whooshing sound followed by a dull impact echoed around.

That was the sound of Irvin slamming the sword's belly into the second son's side.

<b>

"Ka-yaaaahhh?!"

<b>

The second son let out a strange sound that I couldn't quite understand and was sent flying toward the wall.

Twisting and rotating in the air, he flew about 4 to 5 meters before landing face-first, rolling over, and finally crashing against the wall, coming to a stop.

<b>

Ah, this is the move I often use when Irvin makes a half-hearted strike during our duels.

When I do it, I deflect Irvin's sword with the hilt of my sword held in my left hand, then flip my wrist and slam my sword's belly into Irvin's side.

After that, Irvin would fly about 14 to 15 meters, crash into the wall, and roll around shouting, "It hurts! It hurts so much!!"...

But what about the people outside the village? I told them to be careful, so... they shouldn't be hurt too badly, right?

<b>

Ah, his legs twitched. At least he's still alive.

<b>

"Th-that's enough! The winner is Irvin Haggard!!"

<b>

With the senior's declaration of victory, the hall, which had been silent, erupted with the cheers of the students.

Well, that took roughly six seconds from the start, right?

A 'one-hit kill', Irvin!

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

"Reilly! Reilly!! Are you okay?! Hey?! Reilly!! Respond to me, Reilly!!"

"Get away, new student! Hurry and remove the armor! At the same time, check his condition!!"

<b>

"Bruising around the right eye socket. He is unconscious, but his breathing is stable. Pulse, one, two, three..."

"Cracks in the left 8th, 9th, and 10th ribs are observed!"

<b>

"No damage to the eye socket, cheekbone, or nasal bone? No internal bleeding in the skull... none, huh?"

"Se-senpai! Karoff-senpai! His right hand..."

"Oh dear, it must have dislocated from the impact... We need to realign the carpal bones. The radius and ulna are fine, right? There is ligament damage, so be mindful of that when using 'Healing'."

"Yes!"

"You take care of the ribs. There is no displacement, so just apply 'Healing' for the fractures, and he should be fine."

"Y-yes."

"And you, focus on his face with 'Healing'. There shouldn't be any major damage to the skull, but there will be some damage around the eye socket and cheekbone, so be mindful of that."

"Yes."

"Now! Let's get him on a stretcher and take him to the infirmary. Be as quiet as possible."

"Yes, yes, yes!"

<b>

"............"

"You don't have to cry... well, I think there will be some bruising for 2 to 3 days. Now, go on and follow them."

"...... Yes."

<b>

"Even if there are cracks in the bones, there are no internal injuries, huh... 'Not holding back at all, and sufficient moderation', huh? ... Quite the skill, Irvin?"

<b>

Thank you for always reading!
