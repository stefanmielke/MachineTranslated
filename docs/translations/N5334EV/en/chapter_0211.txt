# 199 Preparing to Intercept

"The clouds are coming, aren't they ....... Should I get my rain gear ready?"

<blank>

The storm glass the doctor has doesn't show clouds but rain, so you have nothing to worry about!"

<blank>

Looking up at the clouds above, Selkie Mau put her hand on her cheek and murmured worriedly, to which Beatrice Kuroki replied that there was nothing to worry about.

But more than that, with her hands on her hips, Beatrice turns to Irving Haggard.

<blank>

Irving! You don't have to teach me to sleep in a tree anymore!"

<blank>

What?" Why? It's the best position to camp! And it's super easy!"

<blank>

Irving is the only one who thinks so! The teachers have begged me to keep it to myself!"

<blank>

I'd say I'm pretty comfortable with it, or I wouldn't say I'm particularly inconvenienced by it. ......

<blank>

Merle should keep his mouth shut.

<blank>

Selkie Mau grabs Cu Merle by the sleeve and pulls him back to her side, as he tries to step forward energetically for some reason.

His face is quietly smiling, but I can't help but feel the pressure there, and Cu Merle involuntarily puts down the triangular ears on his own head.

<blank>

It's usually tough to get up in the morning on top of a tree."

<blank>

Especially! Stop instructing the girls!"

<blank>

When Mia smiles at the selkie as if in sympathy, Beatrice tells Irving without a pause.

<blank>

Why? Why not? I can't believe Dana. ......"

<blank>

Stop it!

<blank>

I understand. ............"

<blank>

At Beatrice's strong words, Irving understood that he was the one who should not argue with her and quietly retracted his opinion.

Selkie Mau, who was watching the situation, patted her chest in relief.

Beatrice and Mia smiled apologetically at the selkie.

<blank>

<blank>

After arriving at this campsite, the AMCAM staff members were advising the students on how to set up camp, as originally planned.

How to set up a tent, manage a fire, how to cook a simple boil, etc.

<blank>

Basically, it is something that students have to do on their own, so I stop at the bare minimum of advice. ...... It seems that there was a person among them who gave slightly oblique advice.

Irving's it is advice from his own experience at Amcam, which is so insane to the average person.

Beatrice, Mia, and Lombard were taking care of the situation, but Irving was oblivious to it.

<blank>

Selkie Mau and Cu Merle had come to Beatrice and her colleagues to ask if they could do something about that instruction by Irving. They had come to Beatrice and her colleagues for advice on how to deal with Irving's teaching.

As for the girls who take advice, I am not stingy to receive guidance from Irving.

However, sleeping in the trees is not a quicksand.

I knew he had no bad intentions, so I could not be indifferent, and I was in a terrible bind, but Bibi's blackmail brought the conversation to a conclusion.

<blank>

Selkie felt her shoulders relax all at once, having done a great job.

Seeing his friend's relaxed state, Merle also quickly put up his prone ears and nodded to himself, saying, "It was good, it was good.

<blank>

As Selkie looked at her friend sideways, she wondered, "Does he really know what he's talking about? But Selkie knows that it is better not to say anything.

<blank>

Well, it's always the same ...... and it was Selkie Mau who smiled back at Beatrice and Mia, who giggled.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suddenly, a small white animal at Beatrice's shoulder made a small "kikyu" sound and looked up into the depths of the forest.

<blank>

Algernon?"

<blank>

When Beatrice asks, Algernon moves his nose finely while facing the forest, and again makes a small voice.

<blank>

Go! Go!"

<blank>

With a short cry in reply, Algernon leaps over her shoulder, through the trees, and disappears into the depths of the forest.

<blank>

"What's up? Bibi?"

<blank>

Irving approached Beatrice's side with his hand on the two-handed sword he carried on his back.

<blank>

I'm checking on you right now!"

<blank>

Beatrice answered quietly, looking behind the trees where Algernon had disappeared.

Its eyes are directed toward the darkness deep in the forest.

And suddenly, those Beatrice eyes widened.

<blank>

Dear Selkie! Merle-sama! May I have a message for the teachers?

<blank>

Without pausing, Beatrice turned around and addressed the selkies.

<blank>

Do you have a "Yes? Yes, that's fine. ....... Can I help you?"

<blank>

No, it's no big deal! It's not a big deal! It's just like a regular report!"

<blank>

Perhaps concerned by the series of Beatrice's behavior, Selkie asks back if something is wrong.

Beatrice, however, gave her a soft smile.

<blank>

"Tell Dr. Ursula, 'Observe five evening stars. Please tell him 'Wind to the west'!"

<blank>

"Yes, sir? Five evening stars, winds in the west?"

<blank>

Yes! That explains it! Please expedite this process for me!"

<blank>

"I understand ............. I certainly understand.

<blank>

Thank you, sir! We will now make our rounds and prepare to take our turn at the sleepless night!"

<blank>

I see. Please take care not to overdo it."

<blank>

Silky stared Beatrice squarely in the eye, then bowed his head in a clean gesture and walked away from the place with Merle at a quick pace.

After silently watching them off, Beatrice turns and shouts to her companions just as they pass through the trees and out of sight.

<blank>

All hands on alert!

<blank>

'Bibi, was that a code?

<blank>

Yes, I did! I had decided in advance with the teachers! Dawn star' is clear! Evening star' is an emergency alert! The number of stars is the level! Five stars is the highest alert! West is the direction of Magnumtor City! That means we've been advised to evacuate to the city center!

<blank>

Is the enemy in the forest? Direction and numbers?

<blank>

At Beatrice's side, Irving draws a two-handed sword from his back.

<blank>

In the woods! From all directions! The count is no less than a hundred so far! It's a bit of a stampede!"

<blank>

Surprisingly early for you."

<blank>

I thought you'd be here later! I thought it would be later if you were coming."

<blank>

The time now is a little before 9:00 p.m., still in the early evening.

Students are getting ready for bedtime, but there is still some time before lights out.

If there was going to be an attack here, it would be after midnight. That was the general view.

<blank>

A white mass ran back from the trees.

With a fluid motion, the white mass of Algernon runs all the way up to Beatrice's shoulder.

Beatrice gently stroked Algernon's small head with her fingertips, saying, "Thanks for your help.

<blank>

However, he immediately pulls a small note from his chest and holds it out in front of Algernon.

Algernon gave a small whimper, sucked the note into his mouth, ran down from his shoulder, and disappeared, this time running toward the back of Beatrice and the others.

<blank>

I've asked Algernon to take a message to Mr. Rudri's team! From there, he should be able to reach the rest of the bouncer team!"

<blank>

The bouncer team had come to this campsite with their students.

The students are surrounded by guards on the west, east, and south sides of the camp, to be in line with the Amkham forces on the north side of the camp.

<blank>

The camp leaders have been informed in advance that there may be an emergency evacuation drill somewhere today or tomorrow! The teachers will be notified and will give evacuation instructions to the students, but I don't think there will be any panic!"

<blank>

Bouncers escort the students who are evacuating to prevent the demonic beasts from approaching.

The formation has been discussed in advance. Evacuation arrangements will be no problem.

<blank>

Now they see a sparsely planted forest of trees.

The trees become denser as you go deeper into the area, which is known as the "Silobane Forest," extending approximately four to five kilometers from there.

<blank>

Further on, the area became a volcanic zone with bare bedrock, and a vast expanse of geysers that erupted once every hour or two, brightly colored hydrothermal springs, and gas-guzzling sulfur springs.

The Rohan Nature Park is an 85,000-hectare area that stretches about 25 kilometers from north to south and 35 kilometers from east to west, centered on the Rohan Volcano, a caldera.

<blank>

<blank>

Now, in front of Beatriz and her friends, stone pillars 50 centimeters thick and about two meters high stand roughly 50 meters apart.

On top of the stone pillar was a lantern-like object that emitted a pale blue magical light.

This is the vast number of warding devices that surround this vast natural park.

<blank>

The lead of the enemy is now in the woods about two kilometers from this warding device! They are approaching from small objects! We'll be ready to intercept them here in 5 minutes!"

<blank>

Beatrice quickly cast an auxiliary magic for the night battle.

Visible Light Amplification

It is a magic that literally amplifies visible light to augment vision in the dark.

It is an indispensable auxiliary magic when fighting in the forest at night, when light is scarce. Each of their eyes is lit by a faint glow of magic power.

<blank>

You know what I mean! Don't look at the bonfire until the magic has adjusted! You won't be able to see for a while!"

<blank>

Irving steps out, looking only ahead so as not to see the light of the bonfire burning behind him.

<blank>

Mia, while I cast support spells on everyone! Take care of the walls!

I got it!"

<blank>

Beatrice chants "Chant of War" and casts a strengthening spell on each of them.

Then Mia stepped forward from everyone else.

The magic beads that were inlaid into the glove flooded the area with a light green light. Mia crouched down on the spot, placed her palm on the ground as it was, and started chanting magic while meditating.

<blank>

Praise the silent breath of the forest, and give thanks for the clear waters and the generous earth. Thriving briars, be a wall against my enemies! Briars as a barrier!

<blank>

When Mia chanted the magic name, the glove's magic beads glowed with a singularly large light.

At the same time, the briars split the ground on both sides of the mia and grew up one after another, forming a series of walls in front of the stone pillars.

<blank>

"It's not like we can reach all of the nature parks from here or anything, you know?"

I know! Just get the rest here as much as possible! Lombard!

Oh!"

<blank>

The two-meter-high walls of thorns stretched about 100 meters from each side of the mia, east to west.

Far less to enclose the entire natural park, but enough to cover the campground.

Mia, standing up, steps back as if to retreat from the wall of thorns that has been created.

Then Lombardo stepped forward to swap places with Mia and lead everyone.

<blank>

The teachers are supposed to send this alert to the park office as well! As soon as the office confirms the stampede, the physical warding will be deployed! We'll do everything we can to hold them off until then!"

<blank>

It will probably take about 15 minutes for the office to be contacted and the warding deployed.

Until then, we will defend this place at all costs with this lineup!

<blank>

It's coming! It's from a small magical beast! It's not intimidated by the 'fear forging' that the warding pillar is unleashing! Is this ...... 'frenzy'?

<blank>

Multiple pairs of red lights loom from among the trees in the forest.

It is the violent glint in the eyes of the demonic beast.

<blank>

A high pitched cry came from above, and one of the demonic beasts jumped at it.

It is a 40-centimeter-long ape-like magical beast called a "Grim Macaque.

They act in groups, are devious, and their nature is ferocious.

<blank>

The beast leapt from the branches of the tree, catching many of its companions on the ground by surprise.

However, its body is cut in two with a hollow assailant.

The moment it leaped into action, Irving flashed it with his two-handed sword.

<blank>

As soon as the two separate bodies fell to the ground, Lombardo, holding his battle-axe in front of him, howled up.

The Hate Howl.

Lombard's cry shakes the atmosphere and focuses the magical beasts' attention on him.

More than a dozen magical beasts, hatred in their eyes, leapt toward Lombardt at once.

<blank>

Fine Root Needle"

But then, countless tree roots that have turned into needles grow up from the ground and skewer the magical beasts one after another.

The magic Mia had invoked had penetrated most of the magical beasts that had leapt at Lombardt.

<blank>

Those who were lucky enough to escape its vicious roots were cut in two one moment, and the next, they fell to the ground from one end of the body to the other.

<blank>

Now, let's do some light preparation.

<blank>

Waving his two-handed sword with one hand and shaking off the demon beast's blood glue, Irving turns his fearless eyes toward the depths of the forest and says, "I'm not sure I can do this.
