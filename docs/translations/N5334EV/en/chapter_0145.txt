# Chapter 133: Cordelia Casper's Challenge

"Let's go inside the building soon. I brought cookies for everyone today. Dan, Nan, could you help set the table with everyone inside?"

<b>

Annie called out to the twins, slightly stepping away from the position where the three were embracing, turning her back to the street.

<b>

She had requested security personnel at the mansion, but even though she had asked them to hurry, she thought it would still take about an hour for them to arrive. Until then, she had to protect this place herself.

<b>

Annie was thinking about this as she directed her gaze towards the corner of the row of houses ahead.

<b>

<b>

"Wow! Cookies?!"

<b>

Cordelia reacted to Annie's words, standing up with a loud voice.

<b>

"I haven't prepared anything! ...Cake! That's it! If I go buy a chiffon cake from that shop right now..."

"Please calm down, Lady Cordelia. It would be inappropriate to prepare items from that shop when she is about to return."

"But..."

"I will go buy items from a different shop. Lady Cordelia, please wait inside with the children. I believe it will allow for a more natural conversation when she arrives."

"Is that so...? Perhaps you're right!"

"Then I will be off. I think I can return in less than 30 minutes. Catherine, please take care of things. Make sure not to confuse Lady Cordelia with any strange behavior! ...Please, do be careful!!"

"Leave it to me. There's no need for unnecessary worry, Lucille."

<b>

Lucille, after giving Catherine a suspicious glance, said, "I truly appreciate it," and quickly left the scene.

<b>

<b>

Meanwhile, the twins were excitedly watching as packages of cookies came out one after another from Annie's pouch.

<b>

"I'll open these cookies, so we need to set the plates on the table. I'll also brew some tea, so let's boil some water. We need to prepare cups for everyone. How many people are here right now?"

"Hmm, four?"

"If you include me and Dan, that's six!"

"Yeah, there are always three people sitting at the table!"

<b>

"…Six? I thought there were a few more… Huh?"

<b>

Annie tilted her head and instructed the twins to go inside the facility while waiting for the cookies. Cordelia watched them with a smile, but inside, she was desperately trying to calm her heart, which was pounding like a drum.

<b>

<b>

I can finally have a proper conversation with that child here!

In this place, there are no students from the academy around, and with Dan and Nan here, that child should be able to respond without hesitation!!

Finally, finally, we can talk like we used to...

<b>

"Please wait inside, Senior Casper."

<b>

Just as Cordelia was about to immerse herself in her fantasies, she was jolted back to reality by Annie's voice.

<b>

"...Huh? A-am I allowed to join as well?"

"Of course. Dan and Nan are here as well."

"I-is that so...? Then I shall excuse myself..."

<b>

At Annie's words, Cordelia relaxed her slightly tense face and began to move forward as invited.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey! Is this the right place? Gahaha!"

"Yeah, this is it! This shabby building with the purple roof."

<b>

Suddenly, coarse male voices echoed nearby.

The voices came from around four to five meters away, from the corner where Cordelia and the others were currently located.

The direction Annie had been looking at earlier.

<b>

The owners of the voices soon began to reveal themselves.

<b>

Four men dressed in flashy shirts and jackets, looking very much like thugs, were walking straight towards Cordelia and the others.

<b>

Annie clicked her tongue softly as she watched them.

<b>

"What’s this? There are women in front of the entrance. Parker, are you hearing anything?"

"I... I’m not hearing anything."

<b>

Exposed to the crude behavior of the men and their unreserved gazes, Cordelia and Catherine's eyes widened.

<b>

Annie tightened her mouth, feeling bitter about the delay in hiding Cordelia and the others inside the facility.

<b>

She had sensed an unpleasant presence approaching for some time now.

It wasn't something she could perceive as hostility like with Irvin and the others, nor did she have the precision to grasp a clear location or distance like Suzy.

<b>

It was merely a feeling of "something unpleasant is nearby."

<b>

For those living in Amukam, sensing hostility is like a wild instinct that increases survival chances.

<b>

Even though she had lived in a city far from the forest, Annie, at her age, could certainly be said to be of Amukam's... Cloud's bloodline.

<b>

And now, the source of that "unpleasant feeling" was approaching right in front of her.

<b>

"Probably this is the right place. Once we get inside, we’ll know."

<b>

One of the men glanced sideways at Annie, avoiding her as he stepped forward to reach for the door. But Annie smoothly moved to block his path, inserting herself between the man and the door.

<b>

"We do not welcome those who have no business with this facility."

<b>

The man suddenly halted as Annie blocked his way, and he looked down at her with a glare filled with irritation.

<b>

"What the hell, kid?!"

"If you have no business here, please leave."

"I came all the way here because I have business! Move aside, kid!!"

<b>

The man swung his hand roughly to shove Annie aside.

However, Annie dodged it effortlessly by leaning back.

The man, taken aback, glared at Annie again.

<b>

"You're messing with me, kid!!"

"If you continue to act violently, I will call the guards."

"Hah! If you can, go ahead and call them!"

"Don't worry. I have already called them, and they will arrive shortly."

"What?! H-Hey!!"

"I-I didn’t hear that!"

<b>

In a panic, the man stepped back from Annie and looked around nervously with his companions.

<b>

"What do we do now? If the guards come, we're in trouble."

"You idiot! If we go back like this, Fluke will kill us!"

"For now, we take the two kids! Taking the kids is Fluke's order!!"

"Tch! The guards are just a bluff! You kids! If you don't want to get hurt, move aside!!"

<b>

The earlier man pulled out a black object from his pants pocket and gripped it.

The object was a lump made of black leather.

It was about 15 centimeters long from the grip, not thick, but it flexed well when moved.

<b>

It resembled holding a balloon that inflated to about five centimeters in diameter with one hand.

It was a sap, a blunt weapon.

It was made by stuffing sand, iron balls, or lead into a leather pouch and used for striking. It made little noise upon impact and did not cause bleeding, making it a weapon often used by those with ulterior motives.

<b>

The man pointed the tip of it at Annie, thrusting it forward as if to tell her to get out of the way.

Other companions also pulled out similar weapons, displaying them with lewd smiles on their faces.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"You! What are you doing to such a small girl! Aren't you ashamed as men?!!"

<b>

Suddenly, a strong voice was thrown from behind Annie, as if to restrain the movements of the men.

<b>

"Such an act of violence! This is Cordelia Casper! I cannot overlook it!"

<b>

Cordelia, holding a fan she had taken out from somewhere, thrust it towards the men and glared at them fiercely.

<b>

"Hey, hey, hey! What’s this? Now even the young lady is here?!"

"Do you not understand the situation? These young ladies!"

"Surrounded by four men, do you think you can do anything about it?! Instead, we might do something to you?! Gahaha!"

<b>

"Hey! You guys! If you're going to play around, finish Fluke's job first!"

"Shut up, Parker! Don't give orders!"

"I know! You’re aiming for the students of Millia who come here, right? Huh?"

"Tch!"

"I heard you got hurt? You never learn, do you? Gahaha! Should I take this young lady with me instead? Gahahaha!"

"Shut up! Karen is my prey! I'll take care of it, I’ll do it! You think you can mess with me?! I’ll make sure to teach you a lesson! This time, I’ll completely wreck you!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

Four young men with rough appearances were throwing lewd glances at them.

For Cordelia, who had never been subjected to such feelings from men, it was an experience that sent shivers down her spine.

<b>

<b>

But more than that, these guys had said something that could not be overlooked.

<b>

"What... did you just say about Karen?"

<b>

A voice, colder than anyone would expect from her usual demeanor, slipped from her small mouth.

<b>

"I understand very well what you meant by coming here."

<b>

Cordelia smoothly returned the fan she had thrust forward to her mouth.

<b>

"However! This is not a place where filthy beings like you are allowed to linger! I strongly recommend you retreat to your dwelling before you are exterminated."

<b>

Then, as if she could not bear the stench emanating from them, she half-opened the fan to cover her mouth and spat venom at the men.

<b>

"You little... You dare treat us like pests? You’ve got some nerve, huh?!"

<b>

"Oh? So you understood the meaning of my words? That was unexpected. Should I commend you for that?"

<b>

Hiding her mouth with the fan, Cordelia giggled softly.

<b>

"You've got some nerve! I’ll make sure to mess you up along with Karen, just as you wish!!"

<b>

Parker, with veins bulging on his forehead and his face darkened with rage, approached with his companions, taking rough strides.

<b>

<b>

"I’m not so soft as to fall behind someone like you!"

<b>

Cordelia snapped the fan shut and slightly raised the corners of her mouth, challenging the men.

<b>

Then Annie, as if to protect Cordelia, tried to step forward.

However, Cordelia gently placed her hand on her shoulder to stop her.

<b>

"Cloud, I have witnessed your courage."

"It’s Annie, Lady Casper."

"I’m fine with calling you Cordelia, Annie."

"Thank you, Lady Cordelia."

<b>

"Now, Annie, please step back a little. The front line here is my job. May I count on you to support me?"

"Of course, Lady Cordelia."

<b>

Annie met Cordelia's gaze, smiled back as if understanding her intent, and stepped back to her side.

<b>

"Catherine. Please lend me a bit of your courage to protect these children."

"As you wish."

<b>

By the time Cordelia spoke, Catherine had already drawn her wand from the holster at her waist.

And immediately after responding, she began to chant a protective spell.

<b>

――――This person is usually quite clumsy, but once something triggers her, she suddenly starts acting like a real hero.

That’s why both Lucille and I can’t take our eyes off you.

Now, since I’m entrusted with Lucille's safety, I won’t let anything happen while she’s not here. I will protect you with all my might.――――

<b>

The priest's force field enveloped them, and a soft glow filled the area.

<b>

"Now! Uninvited guests! Come forth from those who fear crawling on the ground!"

<b>

Cordelia Casper thrust her fan powerfully towards the men and declared loudly.
