# 133 Cordelia Casper's Dare

It's time to get inside the mane," he said. I brought cookies for everyone. Dan, Nan, will you help me set the table for everyone inside?"

<blank>

Annie called out to the twins as she turned her back to the street, slightly out of the position of the three embracing each other.

<blank>

I've asked for security personnel at the mansion, and although I told them to hurry, I don't think they will be here for another hour or so. Until then, I have to protect this place.

<blank>

Annie was thinking about this as she turned her gaze to the corner of the row of tenement houses that lined the street.

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, my God! Cookies?

<blank>

Cordilia responded to Annie's words and stood up, shouting loudly.

<blank>

I didn't prepare anything! ...... cake! That's right! If I go to that store now and buy a chiffon cake ......"

I'm sure you'll understand," he said, "but please calm down, Miss Cordelia. She's coming back, and I don't think it's right to go to the trouble of preparing items from that store."

So, but ......"

I'll go to a different store to buy some items for this occasion. I will go to a different store to buy some items. That way, when she arrives, we can have a natural conversation.

"Well, I guess so. ...... Yes, I guess so!"

I will be back in less than half an hour. I'll be back in less than half an hour. Please do not mislead Ms. Cordelia with your strange behavior! ...... please!

I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it, Lucille.

<blank>

Lucille gave Kathryn one last, huffy look before announcing, "I'm really asking for it," and strode away from the scene.

<blank>

<blank>

The twins, on the other hand, are pleased to see a package of cookies coming out of Annie's pochette, one after the other.

<blank>

I'm going to open these cookies, so we need to set the plates on the table. We also need to boil water to make tea. We also need to make cups for the number of people. How many people are here now?

Uh, four?

If you count me and Dan, there are six of us!

Yes, we always sit three at a table!"

<blank>

I thought there were a few more ......6 people?" I thought there were a few more. ...... that?"

<blank>

Annie tilts her head and tells the twins to go inside the facility, leaving Cookie waiting.

Cordelia looks at her smilingly, but inside she is struggling to hold back her heart, which is starting to beat like a fast bell.

<blank>

<blank>

I can talk to her right here!

This place is out of sight of the students at the school, and with Dan and Nan around, I'm sure she would feel free to answer my questions!

Finally, finally, we can talk like we used to. ......

<blank>

Casper, please wait inside.

<blank>

Just as Cordelia was about to enter into her delusion, Annie called out to her and she came to her senses.

<blank>

"......? Oh, me too, yes, is that okay?"

Of course. Dan and Nan are here.

I see. ......." Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to ......."

<blank>

At Annie's words, Cordelia's slightly stiffened face relaxed and she tried to follow her invitation to step forward.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sure that's where it is! Are you sure you're in the right place? Gahaha!"

"Ah, here it is, here it is! It's this dirty little building with a purple roof.

<blank>

There, suddenly, the voices of crude men echoed.

The voice came from around the corner, four or five meters from where Cordilia and her friends were now.

That's the direction Annie was looking in earlier.

<blank>

The owners of the voices begin to show themselves immediately.

<blank>

There were four guys dressed in flashy shirts and jackets, looking like hoodlums. They walk straight toward Cordelia and the others.

<blank>

Annie, looking at it, gave a small tongue-twister.

<blank>

What? There's a woman in front of the entrance. Parker, you hear anything?"

"...... I ain't heard nothing."

<blank>

Cordilia and Catherine's eyes widen as they are exposed to the coarse men's words and actions and their unreserved stares.

<blank>

Annie's mouth tightened and she felt bitter about the delay in hiding Cordelia and the others in the facility.

<blank>

She had sensed an unpleasant feeling approaching earlier.

It is not enough to sense hostility like Irvin's group, and of course it is not accurate enough to grasp the clear position and distance like Suzy's group.

<blank>

It was just to the extent that I felt that there were things nearby that I didn't like.

<blank>

For those living in Amkam, sensing hostility is like a wild intuition that increases the probability of survival.

<blank>

Even though she has lived in the city, far from the forest, we can say that Annie, who has that sense at her age, is also certainly of Amkam's ...... Cloud bloodline.

<blank>

And now, the person who had been giving Annie such a 'bad feeling' was right in front of her.

<blank>

"Maybe this is the right place. You'll know when you get inside."

<blank>

One of the men, looking sideways at Annie, avoided her and tried to step out to reach the door. But Annie blocked the man's way with a fluid motion and put herself between him and the door.

<blank>

We do not accept visitors who have no business at this establishment."

<blank>

The man stops dead in his tracks when Annie suddenly blocks his way.

He looked down at Annie with an irritated look in his eyes.

<blank>

What the hell, you little brat!"

If you have no further business, please leave."

You came all the way here because you have something to do! Get out of my way! You little shit!

<blank>

The man roughly swept his hand to the side to brush Annie off.

However, Annie ducks it without a hitch with a swerve back to the upper body.

The man, who had stepped on Tatara without a second thought, glared at Annie again.

<blank>

You're such a jerk! You little shit!

If you are going to do something naughty, I'll call my Eishi."

"Ha! If you can call them, they can call us!"

Don't worry. We have already called for you, and you will be on your way shortly.

What? Oh, hey!

No, no! I didn't hear you!"

<blank>

Quickly, the man moved away from Annie and looked around restlessly with his friends.

<blank>

What are we going to do? If the guards come, we're in trouble!"

I said, "You idiot! Mr. Fluke will kill you if you leave like this!"

I'll take the two kids for now! I'm taking the kids! This is an order from Mr. Fluke!

I'll tell you what," he said, "I'll go to the guard! The guards are just fools! You little brat! Get out of my way unless you want to get hurt!

<blank>

The man from earlier pulls a black mass from his pants pocket and grabs it.

At the end of his grip is a lump made of black leather.

It is about 15 cm long from the hand that holds it to the end, and although it is not thick, it flexes well when the hand is moved.

<blank>

It is like holding a stick balloon, inflated to about 5 cm, in one hand.

It was a bludgeoning weapon called a sap.

The skin is made in the shape of a sack and stuffed with sand, iron balls, lead, or other materials. Since the sound of the blows is low and there is no bloodshed, this weapon is often used by those with a sinister purpose.

<blank>

The man pointed the tip of it at Annie and stuck it out as if to say retreat there.

The other members of the group took out similar weapons and showed them off, putting a sickening smile on their faces.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What have you done to this little girl? What a thing to do to such a little girl! Are you not ashamed of yourselves as men?

<blank>

As if to control the movement of the men, strong words were suddenly thrown from behind Annie.

<blank>

Such outrage! This Cordelia Casper! I will not overlook this!"

<blank>

Cordelia holds a fan in her hand, which she has retrieved from somewhere, and thrusts it at the men, who stare at her with great strength.

<blank>

What's the matter? What, now you're gonna do the same thing to the young lady?

"You don't understand the situation, do you? You ladies don't know what's going on!

You think you can handle being surrounded by four guys? You think you can handle it with four men around you? Gah!

<blank>

Hey! You guys! If you're going to play, finish Mr. Fluke's work first!"

"Shut up, Parker! Don't tell me what to do!

I know! You're the one who's trying to get the students from Milia to come here, aren't you? Huh?"

Tsk!"

"I heard they gave you a hard time, huh? That's not good, is it? Gahaha! I'll take it with the little girl instead? Ha-ha-ha!

Shut up! Karen is mine! I'll get her, I'll get her! I'm gonna get her. I'm gonna get her! I'm gonna make him pay for this! This time I'm going to destroy you!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Four young men with a rough appearance cast a nasty look at us as if they were trying to judge us.

For Cordelia, who had never had this kind of emotion directed at her from a man, this was something that made her shudder and feel fearless.

<blank>

<blank>

But before that, these people said something that I couldn't hear.

<blank>

<blank>

What did you just say about ...... Karen?

<blank>

<blank>

A cold voice, unimaginable from her usual self, was leaking from her small mouth.

<blank>

I understand exactly what you are doing here.

<blank>

Cordelia quickly returns her fan, which she had thrust forward, to her hand and brings it to her mouth.

<blank>

"But, sir! This is not a place for lowly beings such as yourselves to spring up. I strongly recommend that you leave for your homes as soon as possible, before you are exterminated.

<blank>

Then, as if unable to stand the stench in the air, he spreads his fan halfway open to cover his mouth and spits venom at the men.

<blank>

You son of a bitch. ....... You have the nerve to treat us like vermin, don't you? Hey!

<blank>

"Oh? You understood the meaning of the word, didn't you? I didn't expect you to. Should I give you a compliment?"

<blank>

Covering her mouth with a fan, Cordelia laughs, "Hohoho," she says with a colossal smile.

<blank>

You've got some nerve! You! I'm gonna mess you and Karen up, just like you wanted!"

<blank>

Parker, with veins floating on his forehead and his face stained black with blood, comes between the two with his companions with rough steps.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm not warm enough to keep up with you people, am I?"

<blank>

Closing her fan with a snap, Cordelia tells the men, the corners of her mouth slightly turned up in a challenging manner.

<blank>

Then Annie tries to move her foot forward as if to protect Cordelia.

But as if to stop her, Cordelia gently placed her hand on her shoulder.

<blank>

I have seen your courage, Mr. Cloud. I have seen your courage.

Annie, Mr. Casper.

I'm fine with Cordelia too, Annie."

Thank you, Miss Cordelia."

<blank>

Then, Annie, please step back a little. It's my job to be the vanguard here. Can I count on you to do the same?"

Of course, Miss Cordelia.

<blank>

Annie looked back into Cordelia's eyes, smiled as if she understood her intention, and lowered herself to her side.

<blank>

Catherine. Please share a little of your courage with me to protect these children?"

As you wish."

<blank>

Catherine was already holding her own wand, which she had pulled out of the wand holster attached to her waist, when Cordelia spoke the words.

And as soon as he returns the words, he recites a prayer of protection.

<blank>

<blank>

----This man is usually a clunker, but once something flips his switch, he instantly starts doing manly things.

That's why Lucille and I can't take our eyes off of you.

Well, Lucille is in charge. I will not let anything important happen while she is away. I will do my best to protect you. ----

<blank>

<blank>

The priest's force field enveloped the girls and a pale glow flooded the area and fell.

<blank>

<blank>

Come on! Uninvited, ladies and gentlemen! Let those of you who are not afraid to crawl on the ground take the first step!"

<blank>

Cordelia Casper thrusts a fan in her hand powerfully at the men and says in a loud voice.
