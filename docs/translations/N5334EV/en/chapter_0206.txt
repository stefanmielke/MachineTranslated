# Chapter 194: The Bouncers

In fact, this time, Vivi, Mia, Arvin, and Lombard have also received a request for protection.

Of course, this is for the protection of the students participating in this "field trip."

The students do not know that everyone from Amukamu is acting as their "bodyguards."

This is because the chairman wishes for them to be present as advisors, without unnecessarily causing anxiety among the students, as in previous years.

And this time, the protective layer for the "field trip" is surprisingly thick.

<b>

This is because the whereabouts of the former first son of the Niven family, who is suspected to be the black figure behind it all, remain unknown.

It seems that he had clearly shown malicious intent towards Karen and her younger brother and sister.

For this reason, the chairman is greatly increasing vigilance.

<b>

This is naturally the case around the academy, and not only the older brothers and sisters of Amukamu within the academy, but I have also heard that an A-rank team has been called from Amukamu.

Since it was Lombard who told me this, it is surely that sister's team that is heading here.

<b>

<b>

Lord Goldberg, who is Carrie’s father, is also cooperating with the academy's security with the authority of the head of the defense agency, which is even more reassuring.

<b>

In fact, after that, Lord Goldberg secretly visited the dormitory and bowed his head to me.

It was such a sudden occurrence that I panicked, and Vivi and Colin looked at me with suspicious eyes, wondering, "What has happened this time?!", which was truly quite a situation!

<b>

Well, in the end, the reason for his apology was for not being able to keep the agreement with me...

<b>

On the day the undead rampaged in the city.

It seems that the underground detention center, which housed dangerous criminals adjacent to the guard post, was also attacked by the undead.

Strictly speaking, the prisoners held there transformed one after another into violent undead, attacking and rampaging against the living, regardless of the guards inside.

There were quite a number of habitual users of illegal drugs among the detainees, it seems.

<b>

As a result, the two beings, one being Fluke and the other a human-like creature, who were sealed in the heavily secured lowest level of the prison, were also attacked.

It is said that the heads of the two, who were in a state of a Daruma doll with neither lower body nor arms due to the injuries I inflicted, were bitten off.

What remained were two mangled pieces of flesh from the chest down to the abdomen, carelessly rolling around.

<b>

Lord Goldberg said, "I insisted on conducting an investigation! I am truly sorry that it has come to this after forcing you to hand them over!" and bowed his head.

<b>

No, no, no! Isn't that just like the aftermath of a disaster?!

I believe that you and the guards of Dekkenbel have done your jobs sufficiently, don't you?

I have heard that there were quite a number of injured guards as well!

Moreover, I have been told that Lord Goldberg had instructed for a strict and solid defense from the very beginning, with excessive security measures! Please raise your head!!

<b>

In that way, while flustered, I finally got Lord Goldberg to lift his head.

Phew~~. Having someone like the top person of Dekkenbel bow to me is truly a heart-stopping event for a commoner!

<b>

If, hypothetically, Fluke and the others had really escaped, I would definitely find them and turn them to dust.

However, he has not been caught by my detection.

Perhaps he has already... left the detection range from Dekkenbel, or has he truly been eaten and absorbed by other undead...?

<b>

I have heard that the number of undead that were ultimately dealt with was less than half the number of corpses in the morgue.

Perhaps, as Professor Nosori said, many were cannibalizing each other to increase their strength.

It is entirely possible that those who were once Fluke became food for other undead.

<b>

<b>

With that said! We received a promise from Lord Goldberg that he would provide us with "full support."

Not only for the protection of the academy, but he also requested the Bouncer Association to send bodyguards for our "field trip."

It is indeed a very grateful story.

<b>

So now, there are several high-ranking bouncers in Magnumtor City.

One of those teams is that of Mr. Rudori.

I just finished greeting them a little while ago.

If it’s these people, their skills are reliable, and since I know them, I feel at ease.

<b>

I heard from Mr. Rudori that, to assist me, another high-ranking veteran bouncer will accompany us to Munanotos.

Since Mr. Rudori is high-ranking and a veteran, he must be quite a skilled person.

<b>

<b>

After parting with Vivi and the others to meet that veteran, Professor Morris and I arrived at the carriage stop in Magnumtor City.

At the stop, there are various carriages, both large and small, parked in a row.

<b>

As I was wondering which carriage we would use, Professor Morris started walking, saying, "You'll know when you see it."

It seems that the professor knows which carriage we will be using.

<b>

Soon, Professor Morris stopped in front of a carriage, saying, "This one."

It was clearly different from the others, a particularly robust and large carriage. The "horse" was also evidently larger than the others.

<b>

"Wow! Su-chan! I've been waiting for you!"

<b>

From the driver's seat of that carriage, someone called out to me with a cheerful voice.

<b>

"Huh? Alma-san? Why?!"

<b>

It was Alma Malma, who is also the head waitress of the "Large Front Yard."

<b>

"Thank you for today! Hehe♪"

<b>

Alma jumped lightly down from the driver's seat and stood in front of me, showing a dazzling smile.

Her appearance, clad in sturdy exploration gear, was a stark contrast to the cute uniform she usually wore at the shop.

<b>

She wore a leather cape over her shoulders, a leather corset fastened with several buckles as decoration, and a fish-tail bustle skirt that revealed her legs!

Moreover, those long legs were covered with incredibly stylish lace-up knee-high boots!!

<b>

All of them were well-used and showed a great deal of wear.

They were completely different from the brand-new gear that the students were wearing, which seemed to have been assembled just yesterday or today.

Just by wearing them, it was evident that she was a veteran.

<b>

"I’m so excited! It’s been a while since I’ve had a job, so I’ll do my best!"

"Huh? A veteran bouncer is here... Wait, Alma-san, is it you? Huh?!"

<b>

"I’ll do my best to support you, Su-chan!"

"Huh?"

<b>

Unable to fully grasp the situation, I was suddenly hugged tightly by Alma!

Eh―――?! What on earth does this mean?!

Alma-san was also a bouncer?!

This is way too surprising and sudden―――!!
