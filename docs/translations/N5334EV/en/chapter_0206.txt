# 194 The Bouncers

In fact, Bibi, Mia, Irving, and Lombardo have also been asked to escort them this time.

Of course, this is an escort for the students participating in this "outdoor class.

The students don't know that everyone at Amcam is 'escorting' them, though.

We want you to stay as an advisor to the students as you have in previous years, without unnecessarily causing them anxiety. The reason for this is that the president of the board of directors wants to be there as an advisor to the students as in the past.

And the escort layer for this "outdoor class" is thick to say the least.

This is because the whereabouts of the eldest son of the former Niven family, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the incident, are still unknown.

He had clearly shown his intent to harm Karen, her brother, and her sisters.

For this reason, the chancellor is greatly alarmed.

<blank>

That is naturally true around the school, and I heard that not only Kara and the other Amcam brothers and sisters in the school, but also the A-ranked team from Amcam were called in.

Since it was Lombardo who told me this story, I am sure it is that sister's team that is on its way.

<blank>

<blank>

It is even more reassuring to know that Mr. Carey's father, Lord Goldberg, is also cooperating in the security of the school with the authority of the head of the Defense Agency.

<blank>

In fact, afterwards, Lord Goldberg secretly visited me at my dormitory and bowed to me.

It was a sudden and unexpected thing that made my head spin, and Bibi and Colin were looking at me with a confused look, like, "What the hell did you do this time? and Bibi and Colin would look at me with a suspicious look on their faces!

<blank>

The reason for his apology was that he could not keep his promise to me. ......

<blank>

The day that the undead went on the rampage in the city.

The underground detention center for violent criminals, which was adjacent to the guard station, was also attacked by the undead.

Technically speaking, the prisoners who were housed there were transformed one by one into rabid undead, attacking and rampaging through the living one after another, regardless of the prisoner-guards inside.

It must mean that a good number of the inmates are addicts to the illegal drugs.

<blank>

As a result, Fluke and another human-like creature, who had been sealed up in a high security prison at the lowest level, were also attacked.

The wounds inflicted by me had not yet been repaired, and only the heads of the two bodies, which had no lower bodies or arms, had been eaten off.

All that was left were two pieces of flesh from the chest down to the belly area. They were lying in a random heap.

<blank>

Lord Goldberg said, "I am very sorry for what has happened! I am truly sorry that it turned out like this! I am truly sorry for the outcome!

<blank>

No, no, no! That's like the damage of a disaster!

I think Sir and the Dekenberu guards have done their job well enough, don't you?

I heard that there are quite a few injured guards as well!

Besides, I am told that Lord Goldberg had instructed us from the beginning to fortify the place with a heavy and solid defense, and to guard it to excess! Please raise your face!

<blank>

I was so flustered that Lord Goldberg finally raised his head.

Whew~y. Being bowed down to by the chief executive of Dekenberger is a truly heartbreaking event for the average person!

<blank>

If they are. If Fulk and the others are really running away, I will definitely find them and turn them to dust.

But he has not been caught by my detection.

It may be because it has already gone out of my search range from Dekenbel ......, or it may be because it was really eaten and taken in by other undead .......

<blank>

We were also told that the number of objects that were undead that were eventually processed was less than half the number of bodies in the morgue.

Perhaps, as Dr. Nosoli said, many were trying to increase their power by cannibalizing each other.

It is quite possible that those who were the fluke also became food for the other undead.

<blank>

<blank>

That is why! Lord Goldberg has promised to give us his "full support".

Lord Goldberg asked the Bouncer Association to send an escort not only to protect the school, but also for our "outdoor class".

It's a very gratifying story, isn't it?

<blank>

So now there are several pairs of highly ranked bouncers coming to Magnumtor City.

One of the pairs was that Rudri's team.

I have just finished greeting them.

These guys are good at what they do and I know them, so I'm comfortable with them because I know them.

<blank>

Rudri told me that another high-ranked veteran bouncer would accompany me to Munanotos to assist me.

Since Mr. Rudri says he is highly ranked and a veteran, he must be a very skilled person.

<blank>

<blank>

After leaving Bibi and the others, Dr. Morris and I came to the coach stop in Magnumtor City to meet up with the veteran.

More than a dozen carriages of various sizes are parked at the stop.

<blank>

I wondered which carriage we would be using. As I watched, Dr. Morris said, "I know it when I see it," and started to walk away.

Apparently the teacher knows the carriage to use.

<blank>

Immediately, Dr. Morris stopped in front of one of the carriages, saying, "Here we are.

It is clearly different from the others, being a much lumbering and larger carriage. The "horse" is also clearly a size larger than the others.

<blank>

Well! Sue! I've been waiting for you!"

<blank>

From the coach's driver's seat, there was a person who was happy to talk to me.

<blank>

What? Mr. Alma? Why?

<blank>

It was Alma Marma, who is also the head waitress at "The Big Vestibule.

<blank>

I'm so happy to see you today! Uhuâ™ª"

<blank>

Alma-san jumped down lightly from her seat and stood in front of me, spilling out a dazzling smile.

Her appearance is a far cry from the cute uniform she usually wears at the store, and she is clad in solid search gear.

<blank>

She wears a leather cape over her shoulders, a leather corset with decorative clasps, and a fishtail bustle skirt that reveals her legs!

Furthermore, the laced-up knee-high boots that cover her long legs are very cool!

<blank>

They are all very well used and show their age.

It is a far cry from the brand new equipment that the students are wearing now, which seems to have been put together yesterday and today.

It was an outfit that showed that he was a veteran just by the way he wore it.

<blank>

I'm going to work hard, sister! It's been a long time since I've worked, so I'm going to do my best, sis!"

Heh?" I heard there's a veteran bouncer. ...... What? Mr. Alma, huh? Yikes!

<blank>

I'll do my best to support Sue-chan!"

Honyu-myu."

<blank>

Alma hugged me tightly as I was unable to understand the situation and my eyes were black and white!

What the...? What in the world does this mean?

Alma was a bouncer, too?

It's too unexpected and too sudden!
