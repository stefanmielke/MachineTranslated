# Episode 192 To Boltsunan...

Look at this one, Karen! She looks just like Sturgeon!"

Wow, it's true! Wow, what is this? ...... Hone?"

What? I wonder if it's a skeleton ......?"

<blank>

Miss Cordelia plucked the string extending from his head with her fingertips and shook it lightly, causing Hone's body to sway.

Oh, wow! Isn't that just the classic souvenir shop honeysuckle keychain?

If you look around carefully, you will see triangular pieces of cloth pasted here and there on the walls and, further down the wall, a ...... wooden sword, or is it a wooden sword? I'm not sure if it's a wooden sword or not, but there are a lot of them sticking out of the wall.

<blank>

No matter how you look at it, this is a souvenir shop at a tourist attraction!

Yes, that's right! We are literally in a souvenir shop in a hot spring resort! We are at .......

<blank>

I don't know what it is, but I have this unsettling feeling of being screwed up. ......

It's a different world, but it's a souvenir shop ............ in a hot spring resort. Is this HAK0NE? Or is it AT0MI? Or is it KUS0TSU?

Too bad! It is different from everywhere else!

This is a tourist attraction called Magnumtor, located in Boltsunan County!

It is a hot spring resort with hot springs that are so popular that the hot water is rising everywhere.

<blank>

But the story goes that this place was originally a thriving geothermal agricultural area until about 200 years ago.

Of course, there were hot springs, but they were not as tourist-oriented as they are now.

Somewhere along the line, a hot spring resort like this was built and became a tourist attraction. ......

<blank>

Is it my imagination that I feel a certain influence of the brave group?

<blank>

There's even a souvenir shop in Oceano's, in the spa town.

That was definitely not the Jurassic's fault b......! It was the work of a brave man.

<blank>

Somehow, there is a hint of that here, too.

Especially this souvenir shop!

...... Well, okay.

<blank>

The reason why we are in such a touristy place is because the "outdoor class" is to be held at a campsite down the road.

<blank>

We left the school early this morning on a string of horse-drawn wagons and arrived here after a five-hour journey. We are now taking a short rest in Magnumtor, a tourist town at the foot of the campground.

As soon as the break is over, everyone will enter the campsite from here.

<blank>

Well, I will be the only one who will be separated for the next day or so. ......

<blank>

That is why today's students are not in their usual uniforms.

Each of them is dressed in his or her own outdoor attire.

Karen, for example, wears a leather vest and matching pants.

What's the big deal, this is a magical beast material, right?

Apparently, it was sent half-way by the chairman of the board of trustees.

That person also seems moderately overprotective.

<blank>

We, the AMCAM team, were in our usual search gear as a matter of course.

I'm armed to the teeth in some way, so I might have been drawn to some of the students I saw?

<blank>

The second son of the Niven family also looked a little flustered when he saw Irving's two-handed sword.

Well, armed people usually don't get a chance to see them that close up, so what can we do?

<blank>

And speaking of the Niven family, you can visit .......

<blank>

After that event, Lawrence Niven was forced to leave the Niven family in Grouse Mill and was thrown out of his home.

What he did was treasonous and could have destroyed Grouse Mill itself.

The Niven family's decision was swift and precise, the chancellor said.

<blank>

The Niven family, which was about to be dismantled, will be led by Mrs. Niven, who is undergoing medical treatment, and her brother will assist her in putting things together.

Van Niven, the eldest son, like Lawrence, has had his name erased and is considered to have never existed in the Niven family.

So she had the family's son, Reilly Niven, officially take over the reigns when he comes of age.

<blank>

No, it's a mess and it's hard work. A noble family, albeit a former one!

I'm a commoner, so I'm glad that I don't have to deal with the sordid world of the old aristocratic heirs!

<blank>

Kunimoto has been in a lot of trouble since the incident, but his second son, Reilly, looks a little more normal now that he has gotten rid of his charlatanisma. At the time of the incident, his face was quite tense.

It would be nice if this "outdoor class" could change the mood a bit.

Miss Lurie has also become much more mature.

I heard that his father, the mayor, resigned after the incident, so things must be tough here.

<blank>

However, the change in their attitude may not be due solely to troubles at home.

<blank>

Deeply involved in this matter was the vampire who was also the eldest son.

Vampires, who are mixed in with people, can bewitch the minds of those around them and dominate them in a deep and silent way.

said sister Jessica, who is also a priestess.

<blank>

It is very possible that they may have been under some influence as well.

Now, like Karen, she may be trying to break free of that control and regain her true self.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

This would look great on Cody.

What? Well, is that right?"

Yeah! Hola!"

<blank>

Karen picked up one of the hair ornaments on the counter and decorated Miss Cordilia's hair.

The motif of the hair ornament is lilac? It is engraved with a relief of small flowers of four petals clustered together.

The relief seems to have some variation of white, purple, or some other color.

Karen chose a white flower hair ornament.

<blank>

I'm sure Cody will look great in white! I knew Cody would look good in white."

"Does ...... look good on ......?"

You're so cute."

"...... already, Karen Teba ......"

<blank>

Oh, man!

What is it, this lovely creature in red? Miss Cordelia?

Nanny that crisp, masculine girl! Karen?

What a bunch of nonsense!

<blank>

While I was thinking about last week's incident, Karen and Miss Cordelia were creating their own world!

Well, I think it is thanks to Miss Cordilia's support for Karen, who tends to sink, that she is thus regaining her brightness.

I think!

<blank>

Gosh!"

<blank>

Oops, Miss Catherine, who was watching it, just vomited blood!

I know what you're thinking.

I look up at the sky, hold my mouth, and gently hand a handkerchief to Miss Catherine, who also spills a tear along with a single streak of blood.

<blank>

Bibi's looking at that Miss Catherine with a scowl, isn't he?

I think Bibi has been looking at this Mistress Catherine harder than Mistress Cordilia lately. ...... Give him a break, Mistress Lucille is apologizing flat out.

<blank>

I see a lot of these flower motifs. Is it a fad?"

<blank>

Mia said this while picking at her earrings, which were still hanging on the counter.

Yes, I was thinking that too. I see these flowers all over the city.

That is exactly what these flowers are inscribed on streetlights and even on cobblestones.

Is it a flower in the image of this city?

<blank>

These are the flowers of the spirit Syrovane.

<blank>

Lucille, who came forward to hide Miss Catherine, who is taller than she is, behind her own body, explained the situation to me.

It is a fairy tale that people in Boltzunan have heard since childhood.

<blank>

<blank>

This is the story of a village girl who devotes herself to quelling the angry, fire-spewing volcano Rohan, and her best friend, a small forest spirit named Sirobane.

<blank>

In order to heal the forest that his father, the god Rohan, had burned down, Silobane and a girl he had made friends with in the forest planted flowers and nurtured them in the burned earth.

At one point, however, the villagers come under the further recrimination of the god of Rohan.

The Rohan volcano was erupting with more fire than ever before, and people could do nothing but fight in fear.

The villagers thought that an unblemished sacrifice was necessary to appease such great anger.

The village girl was chosen.

The daughter and the spirit Silobane proceed together toward the crater.

They vowed to always be together, and together they threw themselves into the crater.

<blank>

The god of Rohan was greatly grieved that he had burned his own daughter, the spirit Silobane, along with his sacrificial daughter.

In order to mourn them, God covered the foot of the mountain, which had been burned and devastated by a volcanic eruption, with the flowers they loved and regenerated the forest.

<blank>

Since then, the flower has become a symbol of 'rebirth' and 'bonding' in the villages at the foot of the mountain. Nowadays, it is a custom for friends and lovers to send them to each other to reaffirm their connection and to pledge their love.

<blank>

Well, this is a story that shows that this is a land of volcanic beliefs. Sacrificing to a raging volcano is something I have heard of in the original world.

<blank>

I remember that the forest at the back of the camp site was called "Silobane Forest" or something like that.

<blank>

I think Karen would look great in this one. See, you liked red, didn't you?"

"...... yeah."

It looks good on you, Karen.

Yeah? Thank you, Cody."

<blank>

Now Miss Cordilia is putting a red hairpiece on Karen.

Karen takes it very, very happily.

What is it with these two? Are they more in love than I thought?

Let's just go out already!

<blank>

White means 'purity' and red means 'love! And they send it to each other? Isn't this already the same as proposing to each other?

<blank>

Bwhooo ----! and Miss Catherine collapses, vomiting blood.

<blank>

I'm like, "Whoa! Is this guy okay?

<blank>

Even more, Bibi is looking down at the fallen Miss Catherine with a twitch in her eye.

Miss Lucille dragged that Miss Catherine out of the souvenir store, repeating, "Suimasen suimasen," as she exited the store.
