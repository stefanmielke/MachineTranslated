# Chapter 192: To Boltosnan...

"Look at this, Karen! It looks just like a sturgeon!"

"Wow, you're right! What is this? ...A bone?"

"Eh? Is it a skeleton...?"

<b>

Miss Cordelia pinches the string extending from its head with her fingertips and gives it a light shake, causing the bony body to rattle.

Oh! This is precisely the classic souvenir, a bone keychain, isn't it?

Looking around again, I see triangular pieces of cloth stuck to the walls, and further down by the wall... is that a wooden sword? There are several of them sticking out.

<b>

This is clearly a souvenir shop in a tourist area!

Yes! If we were to say where we are right now, it would literally be a souvenir shop in a hot spring town!

<b>

What is this unbearable feeling of it being ruined...?

Even though it's another world, a souvenir shop in a hot spring town... Is this HAK〇NE? Or AT〇MI?! Or perhaps KUS〇TSU?

Unfortunately! It's not like any of those!

This is a tourist spot called Magnumtor in Boltosnan County!!

With the popularity of hot springs, it's a hot spring town with steam rising up everywhere.

<b>

But originally, this place was said to be a land where geothermal agriculture thrived about 200 years ago.

Of course, there were hot springs, but there weren't as many facilities for tourism as there are now.

At some point, a hot spring town like this was created and it became a tourist attraction...

<b>

Is it just my imagination that I feel some influence from the hero's party?

<b>

Even in Oceanos, there are souvenir shops in hot spring towns.

That was undoubtedly due to the Jurassic period... no, it was the work of the hero.

<b>

Here too, there's a similar vibe in the air.

Especially in this souvenir shop!

...Well, it's fine.

<b>

So, why are we in such a tourist spot? Because the aforementioned "outdoor class" is going to be held at the campsite ahead.

<b>

Early this morning, we departed from the academy in a line of carriages and took about five hours to arrive here. Right now, we are taking a short break in this tourist city of Magnumtor, at the foot of the campsite.

As soon as the break is over, everyone will head from here to the campsite.

<b>

Well, I will be taking a separate action for about a day after this...

<b>

For that reason, today's students are not in their usual uniforms.

Each of them is dressed in outdoor-appropriate attire.

Karen, for instance, is in a leather vest and matching pants.

Isn't this made from monster materials?

It seems that the chairman sent it to her somewhat forcefully.

That person seems quite overprotective.

<b>

We, the Amukamu group, are naturally in our usual exploration gear.

Since we are somewhat armed, some of the students who saw us might have been taken aback?

<b>

That girl, Miss Ruu, made a face when she saw the two swords hanging from my waist, and the second son of the Nivun family seemed a bit taken aback when he saw Arvin's two-handed sword.

Well, it's not common to see armed people up close, so I guess it's understandable?

<b>

And speaking of the Nivun family...

<b>

After that, Lawrence Nivun was expelled from the Nivun family of Gruusmil and cast out from his home.

What he did was considered treason and could have destroyed Gruusmil itself.

The Nivun family's judgment was swift and accurate, as the chairman said.

<b>

The Nivun family, which was on the verge of being dismantled, will be led by the younger brother, who will assist the ailing lady.

The eldest son, Van Nivun, has also had his name erased, and he is considered to no longer exist in the Nivun family.

Thus, the family head will be officially succeeded by the lady's son, Rayleigh Nivun, once he comes of age.

<b>

It's tough, isn't it? Even if they were once nobles!

I'm a commoner, so I'm glad I have nothing to do with the messy world of noble succession disputes!

<b>

After that incident, the situation back home has become quite serious, but the second son, Rayleigh, seems to have become somewhat more sensible, shedding his frivolous demeanor. He was quite tense at the time of the incident.

I hope this "outdoor class" can help change his mood a bit.

Miss Ruu has also become quite subdued.

It seems that her father, the mayor, resigned following the incident, so she must be going through a lot too.

<b>

However, the change in attitude of the two is likely not solely due to the troubles at home.

<b>

The one deeply involved in this matter was the aforementioned vampire, who was also the eldest son.

A vampire hidden among humans can confuse the hearts of those around them and quietly control people.

As Sister Jessica, who is also a priestess, said.

<b>

Perhaps they were also under some influence.

Now, like Karen, they might be trying to break free from that control and regain their true selves.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"This would look good on Cody."

"Huh? D-Do you think so?"

"Yeah! Look!"

<b>

Karen picks up one of the hair ornaments displayed on the counter and decorates Miss Cordelia's hair with it.

The motif of the hair ornament seems to be lilac? It has a relief of a small flower with four petals gathered together.

It seems there are variations in colors like white and purple.

The one Karen chose is a white flower hair ornament.

<b>

"Yeah! White really suits Cody."

"...Does it really suit me...?"

"You look super cute."

"...Geez, Karen..."

<b>

So cute!

What is this adorable creature turning red?! Miss Cordelia?!

What’s with that sharp, handsome girl! Karen?!

This is just too cute!!

<b>

While I was lost in thought about last week's incident, Karen and Miss Cordelia were creating their own world!

Well, I think it's thanks to Miss Cordelia supporting Karen, who was feeling down, that she's regaining her brightness.

I think so!

<b>

"Guh!"

<b>

Oh no, Miss Catherine, who was watching that, just spat blood!

I understand her feelings.

I quietly hand a handkerchief to Miss Catherine, who looks up at the sky, covering her mouth, with a single tear falling along with the blood.

<b>

Bibi is looking at Miss Catherine with suspicious eyes.

Recently, Bibi seems to be looking at Miss Catherine more sternly than Miss Cordelia... Please give her a break; Miss Lucille is apologizing profusely.

<b>

"Speaking of which, there are a lot of these flower motifs. Is it a trend?"

<b>

Mia said while pinching one of the earrings hanging from the counter.

Yeah, I was thinking the same. I see this flower everywhere in the town.

It's even carved into streetlights and cobblestones.

Is this the image flower of this town?

<b>

"This is the flower of the spirit Shirobeen."

<b>

Miss Lucille stepped forward to hide herself behind the taller Miss Catherine and explained.

Apparently, it's a fairy tale that the people of Boltosnan have been familiar with since childhood.

<b>

<b>

To calm the raging Rohan volcano, a village girl who sacrificed herself and her small spirit friend Shirobeen from the forest.

<b>

Shirobeen, to heal the forest burned by her father, the god Rohan, was planting flowers with the girl who became her friend in the forest.

But one day, the villagers angered the god Rohan even more.

The people could only tremble in fear of the Rohan volcano, which spewed fire more than ever before.

To calm such great anger, the villagers thought a pure sacrifice was necessary.

The chosen one was that village girl.

The girl and the spirit Shirobeen proceeded together toward the crater.

The two, who had sworn to always be together, threw themselves into the crater together.

<b>

The god Rohan greatly mourned the fact that he had burned not only the sacrificial girl but also the spirit Shirobeen, who was also his daughter.

To mourn them, the god filled the foot of the mountain, which had been burned and devastated by the volcanic eruption, with the flowers loved by the two and restored the forest.

<b>

"Since then, that flower has become a symbol of 'regeneration' and 'bond' in the village at the foot of the mountain. Nowadays, it has become a custom for friends and lovers to send each other these flowers to affirm their connections and make promises."

<b>

I see, this story makes it clear that this is a land with volcanic worship. Offering sacrifices to the raging volcano is something I've heard of even in my original world.

<b>

Speaking of which, the forest behind the campsite was called "Shirobeen Forest."

<b>

"I think this would suit Karen. Look, you liked red, right?"

"...Yeah."

"It looks good on you, Karen."

"Really? Thank you, Cody."

<b>

Now Miss Cordelia is putting a red hair ornament on Karen.

Karen receives it with a very happy expression.

What is with these two? Are they more lovey-dovey than I thought?

Why not just start dating already!!

<b>

"White represents 'purity,' and red signifies 'affection'! Sending these to each other?! Isn't this already equivalent to a proposal?!!"

<b>

Miss Catherine collapses while spewing blood.

<b>

"Whoa! Is she okay?!"

<b>

Bibi is looking down at the collapsed Miss Catherine with a twitching expression.

Miss Lucille keeps repeating "I'm sorry, I'm sorry," as she drags Miss Catherine out of the souvenir shop.
