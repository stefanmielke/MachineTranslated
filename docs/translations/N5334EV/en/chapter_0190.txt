# Chapter 178: The Blue Snake Goul

"What’s going on?! That should have been able to suppress up to 300 magic power! Could it be that it wasn’t functioning? …No! I definitely confirmed it was activated. The weight had certainly increased… Could it be exceeding that?! Am I being misled…?"

<b>

The Goul on the platform is mumbling something. It seems displeased that the shackles weren’t functioning properly, but what can I say to that?

Speaking of which, there are still shackles on my ankles. They’re annoying, so I’ll just take them off too.

One foot at a time, I place the heel of one foot on the ankle shackle and crush it.

Crack! Crack! It seems the material was fragile, as it broke easily.

<b>

"While I was kept waiting, it seems quite a few have gathered, huh?"

<b>

"What did you say?"

<b>

"I was planning to gather the main forces and lie in wait for Rodrick and the others, you know?"

<b>

"…………"

<b>

"But there are still several groups lurking on the highway, right? There are quite a few in the city too. And there are still several hideouts like this fortress, right?"

<b>

"You! How do you know that?!"

<b>

"Oh? Was I right? Thanks for confirming."

<b>

"Bagat! Don’t say unnecessary things!"

<b>

"Ugh."

<b>

"Currently, the total number exceeds 300, huh… And more than two-thirds of them are not human."

<b>

"ッ――――――――！！"

<b>

At that moment, the Goul raised its voice.

<b>

It was a very low sound, in a frequency below human hearing. The back of my head felt a slight discomfort.

At the same time, a vibration that seemed to shake the ground came from the floor.

Then, the door of the arena wall burst open.

<b>

What appeared were countless magical beasts.

The magical beasts broke through not only the door but also the walls, and even burst through the floor of the audience seats.

There were several thieves who were blown away and crushed by the magical beasts, but the one who summoned the beasts didn’t seem to care at all.

<b>

"Giant Lizard," "Little Basilisk," "Giant Poisonous Snake," "Featherless Serpent," "Heavy Gator," and so on...

The magical beasts that appeared were mostly large snakes, lizards, or crocodiles, all reptilian creatures.

Is it a reptilian army?

<b>

The total number of reptiles is around 150 to 160. They are already overflowing into the arena.

Among the thieves in the audience, some were crushed by the magical beasts or trying to escape, while others were taking a fighting stance against me.

<b>

"With this many in front of you, if you can still act all relaxed, then go ahead and try it!!"

<b>

"Is this number enough? I recommend not holding back, you know? Gradual deployment of forces is a foolish strategy, right?"

<b>

"…! Keep talking!"

<b>

It seems this guy has stopped using that uncomfortable, forced polite language.

<b>

At the Goul's words as a signal, the reptiles surged toward me in the center of the arena.

They crawled, breaking the moss-covered stone walls and scraping the floor stones, raising clouds of dust all around.

<b>

"Uh, this might be a bit bad."

<b>

"Ha! It’s too late to be scared now! Get wrecked!!"

<b>

This is bad, really bad… This might be quite serious.

<b>

At this rate… my one-piece is going to get dirty!

<b>

If I get caught up in those guys who are kicking up so much dust, I’ll definitely get covered in dirt!

And more than anything, their stinky smell!

The thought of that seeping into the fabric of this one-piece is unbearable!

<b>

So I decided to change quickly!

<b>

I swiftly select my equipment from the inventory.

I chose the "Hard Leather Armor," which I had just worn not long ago.

Well, against these guys, this zero-rank equipment is more than enough.

<b>

I also take out a weapon.

This one is a D-rank "Generation Sword." I hold one in each hand.

For this level of opponent, zero-rank weapons would be more than sufficient, but unfortunately, there’s no dual-wielding option for zero equipment.

It might be a bit overkill for these guys, but since it’s about the same strength as the standard equipment of the knight order, and if I hold back my own power, it shouldn’t lead to meaningless destruction! Yes!

<b>

<b>

The moment I selected my equipment, it changed without any special light, just a simple switch on the screen.

I was now in a moss green mini-skirt one-piece light leather armor, with short boots and over-the-knee socks. In both hands, I wielded two thick-bladed swords.

Oh, it seems the wig I was wearing was recognized as equipment too, and it came off on its own.

My natural hair was exposed, but… since there’s no longer any meaning in disguising myself, it’s fine, right?

<b>

I waited in the center of the arena as the magical beasts surged toward me. Crawling creatures can be surprisingly fast.

They covered about 10 meters in less than 2 seconds.

<b>

The first magical beast to approach me was right in front of me, and just as its claws were about to touch me.

I stood on my toes for just a moment, then dropped my waist down, stomping the ground with my heel.

<b>

"Power Eruption"

A range skill of the Duel Barbarian.

By releasing the power I’ve built up, it attacks surrounding enemies and knocks them down, applying a debuff that temporarily reduces their mobility.

<b>

A heavy bass sound echoed from the floor, and the ground warped around me, rippling outwards.

The magical beasts within 5 meters of me were blown away like water balloons bursting, scattering their remains everywhere.

Those outside that range were also blown away and crashed into the walls of the arena. Some even rolled up into the audience seats due to the momentum.

<b>

After activating the skill, I immediately ran toward the wall.

I passed the blown-away creatures and reached the edge of the arena, then ran around the wall in a circle.

While running, I slashed at the reptiles coming toward me from the direction of the wall with both swords.

In no time, the floor of the arena was covered in the blood and flesh of the magical beasts.

Yeah, changing was definitely the right choice!

<b>

Still, these magical beasts, I thought they were similar to those from Dekenbel, but… they don’t have that creepy regeneration ability.

If I chop them up this much, they seem unable to recover.

I think they come from the same source, but… maybe they have fewer squirming things inside their bodies?

Well, it’s not the time to observe them closely, so I’ll look into it later.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ugh! What is this?!"

<b>

"Damn it! I can’t stand up!!"

<b>

"What the hell is this… what’s happening?!"

<b>

<b>

"I’m reducing your mobility with a skill, you see. Doesn’t your body feel heavy?"

<b>

"You! When did you…!!"

<b>

"I’m not planning to let anyone escape. I used a radius of about 100 meters? I made it so that the entire fortress is within the range."

<b>

"…………What are you talking about?"

<b>

Having dealt with the initial wave, I approached the Goul and his companions who were flailing around in the upper audience seats.

I also explained the skill I just used to them.

If I had used it without thinking, I probably would have blown away not only the magical beasts around me but the entire fortress as well.

It’s quite difficult to contain the destructive power to just my immediate vicinity while extending the debuff effect over a wide area, you know?!

<b>

"You… are you a bouncer from McGavern?! What’s with that outfit? That hair?! Where did you pull out those weapons from?!!"

<b>

"Umm… Transformation?"

<b>

"Don’t mess with me!!!"

<b>

The bearded Bagat, who shouted, suddenly had his entire face covered. The momentum didn’t just stop at his face but enveloped his whole body.

His body grew one or two sizes larger, exceeding three meters in height. His fur-covered arms became thick like logs, and he brandished knife-like claws toward me.

<b>

The bear-like guy turned into a real bear!

<b>

Well, essentially, it’s called a "Werebear."

This means he’s a "man-eating beast."

<b>

But of course, his attacks couldn’t hit me, and I slipped past the claws that were swung down and sliced through his torso from the navel with my left-hand sword.

Bagat’s upper body rolled down with a strange sound.

<b>

Then, from the right, someone approached with a "Shah" sound, whether it was a voice or a noise.

It was an old man named Garey.

His face was flat, covered in scales, and his neck was unnaturally long. He was approaching while flicking his forked tongue in and out, making "Shah" sounds.

Yeah, it’s a snake man. Apparently, it’s called a "Worsnake."

<b>

But, even though it’s a snake, it has arms and legs.

Is it a skink? Or is it actually a lizard man? If so, then it would be a lizardman.

But lizardmen aren’t man-eating beasts.

When they completely transform, do they lose their arms and legs? Or do they turn into something like a lamia?

Well, whatever. Either way, it’s creepy, so I’ll just slice it.

<b>

Before the snake’s tongue could fully extend, I swiftly slashed with my right-hand sword. The sword cleaved the snake man from the chest, and he too rolled down into the audience seats with a strange sound.

<b>

"You took down these skilled ones… so easily? What the hell are you… who the hell are you?!!"

<b>

Haven’t you seen what I did in the arena below?

Compared to those magical beasts, these two don’t even count. Of course, I can take them down in an instant. Do you understand that?

<b>

"I held back, you know? Otherwise, I would have had to exterminate you."

<b>

"Wha?! Y-you… you are…"

<b>

"Man-eating beasts are vicious monsters that are targets for extermination upon sight. Normally, I would eliminate you immediately, but I have to gather testimony, so I’m being considerate."

<b>

"…You monster!"

<b>

How rude!

Down below, there are quite a number of man-eating beasts mixed in with the reptilian army, and they were all undergoing beastification. Most of the thieves were monsters, right? You’re the real monsters?!

<b>

They have high regeneration abilities, and if I just cut off their arms and legs, if they’re healthy, they’ll grow back immediately.

However, if I slash them with a sword enveloped in "Qi," they won’t regenerate from that. Moreover, it seems to hurt quite a bit.

<b>

Besides the two I just cut, there are many more writhing in the arena below like fish flopping on land, those man-eating beasts.

There are quite a variety of types. The standard werewolf, werebat, wereboar. Were-rat, were-tiger, were-cat, were-lion, were-panther… There are a lot of cat types! Cat people?!

<b>

"It’s like a showcase of man-eating beasts in this band of thieves, huh? …So? You’re just a lackey, and you’re not the boss of these guys, right?"

<b>

"So what if I am?!"

<b>

"Could it be that the real boss is a vampire?! What a twist!"

<b>

"Damn it!!!"

<b>

I was going to continue with something like that… but…

Hey… seriously?

The Goul charged at me in a rage!

<b>

Huh? Isn’t his boss Lawrence Niven from the "Afitorina Trading Company"?

Wait? But I heard Lawrence is just an ordinary human, right? That’s what I heard, right?

Hmm――――――――？

<b>

The Goul’s fingers glowed ominously, and he pointed them toward me.

That glow isn’t something brought by magical power. It’s probably some kind of curse that consumes souls.

In other words, it’s a type of magic that affects the opponent’s soul. Speaking of which, I heard he was a fallen necromancer.

The tips of the Goul’s fingers emitted a dreadful wave.

<b>

Well, those hands won’t reach me! They’re disappointingly too slow to move.

<b>

I lightly twirled my swords in both hands and severed his limbs.

The impact of being cut and the pressure of my sword sent the Goul flying, scraping the floor of the audience seats until he slammed into the back wall.

<b>

"Ughh!!!"

<b>

"You didn’t need your limbs, did you?"

<b>

"Necromancers" sometimes strip the skin from the dead and use it as a medium for spells or curses.

I’ve heard there’s a particularly gruesome "necromancy" where they peel the skin from a dead person’s face and wear it to take that person’s face.

The Goul’s face was revealed as it embedded into the wall, the skin covering it peeling away to reveal a face devoid of skin hidden beneath.

This is how he has been walking around, wearing the faces of others one after another. That’s why it was difficult to grasp his true identity.

The wrist, which was supposed to have a mark that served as proof of identity, also flew away with the arm, but since he can wear skin as much as he wants, it’s questionable whether he still has it. That story might have been a decoy.

Well, for me, I could see from the beginning that he was a "Goul," so there’s no problem!

<b>

"Ugh… that hair…"

<b>

"Huh?"

<b>

"That… red hair… Are you the Red-Haired Devil?!"

<b>

What did you say?!

<b>

"In a single night… you incapacitated over 200 soldiers… I thought it was just a tall tale… but… it’s no joke!"

<b>

Calling such a cute girl a "monster" or "devil," that’s quite a statement, isn’t it?!

<b>

…But, "Red-Haired Devil"…?

It sounds kind of cool, like "White-Haired Devil"? …Maybe? …I might not be wrong about that? Anko-sensei!

No, no, no! What am I saying?!

<b>

But well, it’s true. I was told to disguise myself, and it wasn’t a mistake.

If I hadn’t, I might have been on guard from the start and wouldn’t have been able to sneak into their hideout so smoothly.

I’m really impressed again with Bibi for suggesting that.

<b>

For now, that’s that, but first, I need to deal with this guy.

<b>

"Goul Marduk. A fallen necromancer from Anatris. It seems you’ve been causing quite a bit of trouble since you drifted into this country… A necromancer turned ghoul, impersonating others one after another. Isn’t that a bit too much of a joke?"

<b>

"W-what?! How do you know that?!!"

<b>

"When did you become a ghoul? It’s rare to find a low-level undead with intelligence, you know. I want to learn a lot about your master too."

<b>

"Y-you say I’m low-level?! Y-you… you bastard! Who would open their mouth to you!!"

<b>

"You don’t need to open your mouth, you know."

<b>

"What do you mean?!"

<b>

"This is a band of man-eating beasts led by ghouls on this scale. This is a matter for the temple authorities, you know?"

<b>

"The temple… you say."

<b>

"Do you know what 'spiritual investigation' is?"

<b>

The spiritual investigation device reads the ether information of the target.

When conducting a spiritual investigation, the subject must open their heart to the operator. If they remain stubbornly closed off, the investigation will be rejected, and honest readings cannot be obtained. If done forcibly, it will harm the etheric body connected to the heart and soul.

Accessing the etheric body, which is the outermost layer of the soul, must be done delicately and carefully.

<b>

If one were to forcibly and indiscriminately rummage through the etheric body, it could affect the astral body and mental body beyond that, potentially harming the soul’s realm, the consciousness body.

If done poorly, it could even consume the subject’s very soul.

The spiritual investigation device is a technology that relates to the core of the soul, so its usage rights are controlled by the temple authorities.

<b>

The temple authorities, in principle, do not allow for forced interrogation through spiritual investigation, regardless of how heinous the criminal may be.

<b>

However, if the opponent is a monster, the situation changes.

In cases like this, where monsters have organized collective actions, it can be conducted to investigate the behavioral principles of the monsters.

<b>

Especially in the case of someone like him, who has transformed from a human into a monster.

The priests believe that by purifying the tainted soul shell, the core soul nucleus can be saved.

They say that beyond the purification of the soul’s impurities lies the fundamental salvation of the soul.

<b>

"They say they’ll strip the soul away… It’s a terrifying story, isn’t it?"

<b>

When I explained to the Goul how I would extract information, his eyes widened, and he began to flap his mouth like a fish out of water.

He probably would have turned pale if he had skin, but unfortunately, since he has none, his complexion is unreadable!

<b>

"D-don’t mess with me! I didn’t hear about such a thing… Is that bastard Valgar trying to set me up?!"

<b>

I think "Valgar" refers to a low-level vampire?

So it seems there’s something like that behind him?

<b>

"GohhGahhh――――――――――ッッッ！！！！！"

<b>

Suddenly, the Goul twisted his immobile body embedded in the wall and trembled his throat, letting out a scream.

Immediately after, a heavy vibration echoed from below. It seems the magical beasts that had remained underground have started to move.

<b>

"Damn it! This is my last hidden card!"

<b>

The Goul shouted with bloodshot eyes from his skinless face.
