# 178 - Gor the Blue Snake

What's going on? That thing is supposed to be able to hold down the magic amount to 300! You don't think it wasn't working? ...... No! We definitely confirmed the activation. The weight was definitely increased ............. No way, is it over that? They misidentified it and ...... it?"

<blank>

Gohl, on the dais, is mumbling something. He doesn't seem to like the fact that the shackles weren't working properly.

Well, there are still shackles on my ankles. It's depressing, so let's take these off too.

One foot at a time, step down with the other heel on the ankle fetters.

Bakin! Bakin, this too was easily cracked and removed, perhaps because the material was brittle.

<blank>

It looks like you've had quite a turnout while I've been waiting, huh?"

<blank>

What?"

<blank>

"Were they going to gather the main force and wait for Mr. Roderick and the others?"

<blank>

"............"

<blank>

But there are still a few lurking on the streets, aren't there? There are still a lot of them in the city. And there are still many hideouts like this fort, right?

<blank>

You! How did you know that?

<blank>

"Oh? Did I get it right? Thanks for the answer.

<blank>

Bagad! Don't answer me with unnecessary questions!"

<blank>

"Crap."

<blank>

Now the total number is over 300, huh? ...... and more than two thirds of them are not people.

<blank>

--------!!!"

<blank>

That's when Gohl raised his voice.

<blank>

It is very, very low, a very low frequency that is not in the human audible range. The lower part of the back of my head is a bit mushy.

At the same time, an earth-shaking vibration was transmitted from the floor.

And immediately the doors on the arena walls popped open.

<blank>

Countless magical beasts showed themselves.

The magical beast broke through not only the door, but also the wall, and even smashed through the floor of the auditorium.

There were a number of bandits who were blown away and crushed by the magical beast that jumped out, but the person who summoned the magical beast did not seem to care about such things.

<blank>

The Giant Lizard, Little Basilisk, Giant Poisonous Snake, Featherless Serpent, Heavy Gator, etc. .......

Most of the monsters that appeared were large snakes, lizards, crocodiles, and other scaly crawling creatures.

Is it a reptile army?

<blank>

The total number of reptiles is between 150 and 160. The arena is already overflowing.

The bandits in the audience were not only those who were crushed by the monsters or those who were trying to escape from the place, but also those who were firmly prepared to fight against us.

<blank>

If you can still make a big face in front of this many people, go for it!"

<blank>

"This is how many you have? I recommend that you be sparing, okay? It's foolish to send in forces one after another, isn't it?

<blank>

"......! Keep saying it!"

<blank>

This guy seems to have quit using the clichéd and unpleasant honorifics that don't suit him anymore.

<blank>

Gohl's words were the signal for the reptiles to rush toward me in the center of the arena.

It comes at you, crumbling mossy stone walls, crawling over floor stones as if to scrape them off, and raising dust all over the area.

<blank>

"Hmm, this is a bit of a bad idea."

<blank>

Ha! It's too late to be scared now! Go fuck yourself, you piece of shit!

<blank>

This is bad, this is bad. ...... This could be very bad.

<blank>

I'm going to get ............ this dress dirty if I don't...!

<blank>

If you get caught in the middle of those guys spreading dirt and dust like that, you will definitely be covered in dirt and grime!

And above all, their fishy smell!

I hate to think that such a thing would soak into the fabric of this dress!

<blank>

So I decided to change quickly!

<blank>

Quickly select equipment from the inventory.

I chose the "Hard Leather Armor" that I wore just the other day.

Well, against these guys, this equipment of zero rank is enough.

<blank>

In addition, take out the weapon.

This one is a D-rank "Generation Sword. I hold one of them in each hand.

There is more than enough zero-ranked weapons for this level of opponent, but unfortunately, there is no two-blade specification for zero equipment.

It's a bit too much of a weapon for these guys, but it's as strong as the standard equipment of the Knights, and if you keep your own strength in check, it won't be so pointlessly destructive! Duh!

<blank>

<blank>

At the moment the equipment is selected, there is no particular reason for the light to flood the screen, but the equipment changes as if it were switched on the screen with a simple click.

<blank>

Moss green mini-skirted one-piece light leather equipment, short boots and over-knee. And two swords with thick blades in each hand.

Oops, the wig I was wearing was also recognized as equipment, or it came off on its own.

My natural hair is now exposed, but you can still see it at ....... I guess it doesn't matter now that I'm no longer in disguise!

<blank>

We wait for a while in the center of the arena for the monsters and beasts to come in. Crawling things move surprisingly fast, don't they?

It came in less than two seconds, about 10 meters away.

<blank>

The moment the beast approached me and its claws were about to touch me.

Stand on your tiptoes for a moment, and then stomp the ground with your heels as if you were going to drop down with your hips.

<blank>

Power Irruption."

Duel Barbarian range skills.

It is a ranged attack skill that attacks surrounding enemies by releasing accumulated power, causing them to fall on the spot and adding a debuff that lowers their mobility for a while.

<blank>

A heavy bass sound echoed from the floor! The floor stone distorts around me, and ripples spread over a wide area like waves.

The first impact popped the monsters within five meters of me like a water balloon exploding, scattering their fragments all over the area.

The ones on the outside were blown away without exception and hit the arena wall. Some of them were so powerful that they rolled up the bleachers.

<blank>

After activating my skill, I immediately start running toward the wall.

After passing those who had been sent away and reaching the edge of the arena, he ran around the wall.

While running, he uses his two swords to cut down all the reptiles in his path as they fly toward the wall.

Suddenly the floor inside the arena is covered with the flesh and blood of the magical beast.

Yeah, I knew I was right to change my clothes!

<blank>

Still, I thought these magical beasts were the same kind that appeared in Dekenber, but they don't have the same kind of creepy regenerative power that ...... has.

It seems that if it is cut into so many pieces, it can no longer be repaired.

I think the source is the same. ...... Are there less undulations in the body?

Well, now is not the time for a close observation, I'll check it out later.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

What? What is it?

<blank>

I can't stand up! I can't get up!

<blank>

What the hell is this ......?"

<blank>

<blank>

"Because you're using your skills to reduce your mobility, you know? You feel heavier, don't you?"

<blank>

You! When did you do this?

<blank>

Because I'm not going to let anyone get away with it." About a 100-meter radius? I'm not going to let you get away.

<blank>

"............ what the hell are you talking about?"

<blank>

With everything taken care of, I came over to Gohl and the others who were jittery at the top of the auditorium.

In addition, I explained to him the skills I just used.

If I had used it normally without thinking, I probably would have blown not only the magical beasts around me, but this whole fortress clean off, you know.

It's pretty hard to do this, keeping the destructive power only in your immediate vicinity and making only the debuffing effect extend over a wide area, right?

<blank>

'Are you ...... McGovern's bouncer? What are you wearing? What's with the hair? Where did you get that weapon from?

<blank>

"N----...... change?"

<blank>

Screw you!"

<blank>

The bearded face of the screaming bagad suddenly covers the entire face. The force of the scream is not confined to his face, but covers his entire body.

It had grown one or two times larger and was over three meters tall. His fur-covered arms were as thick as logs, and he bared claws like knives, which he swung down at me.

<blank>

The one that looks like a bear became a real bear!

<blank>

Well, in short, it's called "War Bear.

This guy, in other words, is a "man-eater man-beast.

<blank>

But of course, this thing's attack couldn't possibly hit me, and I slipped through its claws as it swung down at me, slicing its torso in half from the navel with my left sword.

As it is, Bagat's upper body rolls downwards, making funny noises.

<blank>

Then, this time, someone came grabbing at me from the right side, emitting a "shhhh" sound.

It was an old man named Garey.

Her face is flattened and covered with scales, and her neck is long as an arrow. It comes at you with its forked tongue, slithering in and out, and shrieking.

Yeah, it's the snake man. He says it's called "Worth Snake".

<blank>

But it's a snake, but it has arms and legs.

Is it a canary snake? Is it really a lizardman? Then is it a lizardman?

But Lizardmen are not cannibals.

Will it lose its limbs when fully transformed? Or will it be like a lamia?

Well, whatever. Either way, it's gross, so let's cut it down.

<blank>

Faster than the tip of the snake's tongue can extend, it flashes its right-hand sword. The sword sliced the snake man in two from the chest. He, too, rolled away down the audience seats, making a funny sound.

<blank>

"You beat these guys with such ease ...... that they are so skilled? What are you ......? What the hell are you?

<blank>

Did you not see what I did in the arena below?

Compared to those magical beasts, these two are nothing. Of course they would kill them in the blink of an eye. Do you understand?

<blank>

I went easy on you, okay? Otherwise, I'd have to take you down, you know."

<blank>

You know?" Oh, you ...... you ............"

<blank>

The "man-eating 'man-eating man-beast' is a vicious monster that is to be killed as soon as it is found, you know. Normally, they would be destroyed immediately, but we have to take their testimonies, so we have to be careful.

<blank>

"...... you, you, monster!"

<blank>

You're a pompous jerk, Oi!

There were quite a few "man-eaters" down there, mixed in with the reptilian army, and they were causing the beastman phenomenon from one side to the other. Most of the bandits were demons. You guys are the monsters, aren't you?

<blank>

They are very resilient, and if you cut off a limb or two, a new one will grow right back if it's healthy enough.

But when I cut them with my sword, which is covered with Ki, they don't regenerate. And I hear it hurts a lot.

<blank>

In addition to the two I just cut down, there are other cannibals wriggling around like fish on land in the arena below.

There are quite a few different types. The classic warwolves, warbats, and warbores. There are a lot of warrats, war tigers, warcats, war lions, war panthers...... cat people! Catpeople?

<blank>

'They look like a bunch of bandits at a cannibalistic man-beast fair, huh? ...... So? You're just a low-level guy, not the boss of these guys, right?"

<blank>

"So that's why it's ......?!"

<blank>

"No way, the big boss is actually a vampire! What a surprise!"

<blank>

Damn--gah!

<blank>

Nahhhh! Pukkuskus! And I was going to continue, but then I went to .......

Oi ...... really?

Gohl came at me in a rage!

<blank>

Huh? This guy's boss is Lawrence Niven of "The Great Aphitrina Trading Company," right?

Huh? But we're talking about Lawrence being a normal human being, right? Right?

Nn--------?

<blank>

Gohl's five fingers are suspiciously glowing, and he thrusts them toward us.

That glow is not brought about by magic. It is probably a kind of magic that consumes the soul.

In other words, the kind of art that affects the soul of the opponent. I remember that this guy is a necromancer.

Gohl's fingertips emitted fearless vibrations.

<blank>

Well, that hand never reaches me! Unfortunately, it moves too slowly.

<blank>

I lightly swing both swords around and slice off his limbs.

The impact of the cut and the pressure of the sword blew Gohl's body apart, sending him flying to the rearmost wall and crashing into it, scraping the floor stones of the auditorium.

<blank>

Gbogogooooooo!!!!"

<blank>

You didn't need limbs, did you?"

<blank>

A "necromancer" may take the skin of the dead and use it as a medium for magic or curses.

I hear that there is also a fearless "necromancy" that involves removing the skin from the face of a dead person and wearing it to take the person's face away.

Gohl's face had been peeled back from the wall, exposing the skinless face that had been hidden beneath it.

He has been walking around wearing other people's faces one after another in this way. That's why I couldn't figure out who he was.

<blank>

The wrist, which was supposed to have a bruise that was said to be evidence of identification, flew away with the arm, but it is doubtful if it is still there on this guy, who can re-cover his skin as much as he wants. It is also possible that the story itself was a decoy.

Well, I had no problem because I could see that this guy was "Goru" from the very beginning!

<blank>

"Guh ...... ugh ...... that hair ......"

<blank>

Yeah?"

<blank>

'That, uh, red hair ............. Are you the red-haired devil?!"

<blank>

What the hell?

<blank>

"Single-handedly ...... put over 200 troops out of ...... action in just one night. I wondered what ...... the hell you were giving me. That ............ ain't no joke!"

<blank>

You really have a lot of nerve calling such a cute girl a "monster" or a "demon" when you catch her, don't you?

<blank>

...... but "Red Haired Devil" ......?

Is it cool like "What Haired Devil" or is it ......? Do you think ...... is or is not cool? Dr. Yasu!

No, no, no, no! What are you talking about?

<blank>

But, well, that's the thing. They told me to put on a disguise, and I did, which means it wasn't a mistake.

If they were not so good, it is possible that they would have been warned from the beginning and would not have been able to sneak into the hideout in such a good manner.

It's quintessential, and I'm impressed once again with Bibi for suggesting it.

<blank>

Anyway, that's it, we have to deal with this guy first.

<blank>

Ghol Marduk. He is a former necromancer of Anatolis. He has done a lot of mischief in many places since he arrived in this country. ...... Necromancer has now become a necromancer and is pretending to be someone else one after another. Isn't that too punny?"

<blank>

Why are you doing that? How did you know that?

<blank>

When did you become a necrophiliac? It's rare to find a low ranking undead with any intelligence left, you know. I'm going to learn a lot about you, including about your master."

<blank>

"Oh, you think I'm low ......? Oh, oh, no! I'm ...... oo! Who's talking to you? Who's going to talk to you?

<blank>

You don't have to open your mouth.

<blank>

What?

<blank>

This is a group of cannibalistic bandits led by a cannibalistic demon of this size, you know. This is a Temple Authority matter, okay?"

<blank>

"Temple ......," he said.

<blank>

Do you know what a 'psychic examination' is?"

<blank>

<blank>

The Reisai device is a device that reads the etheric information of the subject.

When conducting a psychic examination, the subject must be open to the operator. If the subject's mind is stubbornly closed, scrutiny will be blocked and an honest reading will not be possible. If this is done forcefully, the etheric body, which is connected to the mind and soul, will be damaged.

Access to the etheric body, the surface layer of the soul, must be done delicately and with care.

<blank>

If we were to forcefully and carelessly stir up the etheric body, it would affect the astral and mental bodies beyond it, and could even damage the consciousness, the realm of the soul.

If done poorly, it can even consume the soul of the subject itself.

The Temple Authority is in charge of the use of the Reassay Device, since it is a technology that is related to the very foundation of the soul.

<blank>

As a rule, the Temple Authority does not permit the forced interrogation of any criminal, no matter how heinous the crime.

<blank>

However, if the opponent is a demon, it is a different story.

When demons act in an organized group, as in this case, it is sometimes done to investigate the principles of their behavior.

<blank>

This is especially true if the opponent has changed from a human to a demon, like this guy.

The priests believe that by purifying the defiled soul shell, the fundamental soul nucleus can be saved.

They say that beyond misogi, the purification of the soul to remove its impurities, there is the essential salvation of the soul.

<blank>

They're going to cut out your soul, you know? ...... It's a horrifying story, you know."

<blank>

When I showed Gohl how to get the information out of him, he opened his eyes and started puckering his mouth like a launched carp.

I'm sure that normally they would be blue in complexion, but unfortunately I can't tell their complexion because of the lack of skin!

<blank>

'F**k you! I didn't know this guy was here. ...... I didn't hear this story! Damn that Vargaa! You set me up?

<blank>

I believe "Vargaa" refers to a low class vampire?

Are you saying there's someone like that behind this guy?

<blank>

Googaaaaaaa-------- --！！！！！"

<blank>

Suddenly, Gohl shrank back into the wall and twisted his immobile body, his throat shaking and he let out a cry.

Immediately thereafter, a heavy vibration echoed from underground. It seemed that the demonic beasts still remaining underground had begun to move.

<blank>

Damn it! This is the last and final hidden gem!"

<blank>

Gohl raised his voice, his eyes bloodshot with a skinless face.
