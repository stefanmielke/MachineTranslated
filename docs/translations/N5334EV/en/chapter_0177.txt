# Chapter 165: Report from Annemarie

Mr. Walter Miller.

He is a college friend of Mr. Cain Merlin and has been a business partner with him for a year after graduation at a trading company in Granati.

He is the third son of an old baronial family and was said to have pursued his studies with the aim of starting a business.

Mr. Cain, who had a student marriage, seems to have interacted with Mr. Walter along with his wife, Lady Leela, at that time.

<b>

Eventually, in 2405, the year their eldest daughter, Karen, was born, they returned to Munanotos, and at the same time, the then head of the family retired, and Mr. Cain became the new head.

The retired former head… that is, Lady Leela's father, passed away five years later in 2410.

<b>

<b>

The Munanotos territory, surrounded by mountains, once thrived as a mining area.

However, since about 70 years ago, the extraction of the main ores has decreased, leading to a series of mine closures, and the area has not enjoyed the same prosperity as before.

Even so, it seems that there were still some revenues from mining, albeit modestly.

Therefore, it is believed that the county's management was not in a state of crisis at that time.

<b>

In 2416, when Mr. Cain was 34 years old, Mr. Walter Miller visited Munanotos.

This was the year after the birth of Karen, who was 11 years old, and her twin siblings.

The purpose of his visit was to invite Mr. Cain to be a co-investor in a new business venture and to offer support.

The investment amount was about 100a, so Mr. Cain readily accepted it.

He was also listed as a co-business partner.

<b>

However, a year later, that business failed.

Mr. Walter also went missing afterward, and his whereabouts have remained unknown until now.

<b>

As he was a guarantor as a co-manager of the business and the head of Munanotos, the county administration was also targeted for compensation claims.

There were moments when several mines were on the verge of being seized, but thanks to his wife's management, it seems they managed to hold onto the mountains. However, the debt was enormous, and it was said that the county's management was on the brink of collapse.

At that time, in 2418, an earthquake occurred, causing severe damage that crushed several mines in the Munanotos mountains.

<b>

The cause was volcanic activity from the Rohan volcano.

At that time, neighboring Boltosnan, which also had the Rohan volcano, suffered significant damage.

Boltosnan, which relied heavily on hot springs and tourism revenue, took two years to recover from the damage.

However, it was only through the unwavering commitment and strenuous efforts of the head of Boltosnan that the city of Magnumtor, which was on the verge of destruction within just two years, could be revitalized.

<b>

The mountains and peaks connected to the Rohan volcano in Munanotos suffered the collapse of several mines due to the earthquake's impact.

With the loss of income from the unusable mines, it seemed that funds for recovery were becoming scarce, and just when it appeared that the finances were about to collapse, a proposal for financing and an offer for mine redevelopment came in.

<b>

The counterpart was Mr. Lawrence Niven from Grusmil.

Mr. Niven suggested the possibility of a mithril vein in one of the mines in Munanotos.

<b>

He proposed permission for a large-scale survey of the ore vein and expressed his desire to be listed as a co-developer upon its discovery. Furthermore, he requested to be fully entrusted with the sales channels, and he approached Mr. Cain with a contract.

<b>

Mr. Cain accepted the proposal, and the contract was soon concluded.

<b>

Eventually, large-scale mining was to begin upon the discovery of the mithril vein.

However, before the mining commenced, when Mr. Cain and his wife, Lady Leela, visited the mining site for an inspection, an unfortunate collapse accident occurred, and the couple became lost to the world.

<b>

Currently, the business has been taken over by Mr. Niven, but it seems that there is no prospect of starting the mining operations yet.

<b>

I closed the thin bundle of reports I had in hand and let out a long, quiet sigh.

This report, prepared by Annemarie, was handed to me when I returned to the academy from the Bouncer Association, and although it was not the first time I was reading it, I couldn't help but sigh after going through it.

<b>

<b>

Now we have been waiting for nearly an hour at the county border checkpoint to obtain permission for our carriage to pass.

<b>

At the county border, such checkpoints are usually established.

The town of Masom in Amukam is also a checkpoint.

However, due to the peculiarities of Masom, it is far more stringent than here.

Compared to that, this checkpoint only requires a document check, so I have no complaints.

<b>

But this report, I picked it up thinking I had some time to spare, but I realize again that it's not something to look at just to kill time.

<b>

<b>

This report also contained various details about Mr. Lawrence Niven.

<b>

The Niven family was originally one of the vassals that inherited a fallen earldom.

Grusmil, which had no particularly notable local products, was a land that sustained its economy through trade with foreign countries.

<b>

Amidst this, Mr. Lawrence was brought into the Niven family due to his business acumen.

However, shortly after he was registered, the then head couple died together in a maritime accident, and Mr. Lawrence inherited the position of head.

<b>

Immediately after becoming the head, Mr. Lawrence reorganized the existing trading company and established what is now known as the "Afitrina Trading Company."

The trading company steadily increased its performance and expanded its scale several times within a few years.

His eldest son was born around that time. However, his ailing wife passed away at the same time as the birth of their son.

A few years later, he remarried a cousin of his late wife. This woman is said to be the mother of the second son.

However, this woman is also in poor health and is currently recuperating in a sanatorium.

<b>

<b>

Mr. Lawrence is reportedly known for his rather aggressive business practices.

Transactions that are close to intimidation and forceful mergers are commonplace, and he is said to be a person who is constantly surrounded by dark rumors.

When an incident occurred where the family of a rival trading company was attacked by robbers, resulting in the entire family being wiped out, it was whispered that Mr. Lawrence was pulling the strings behind the scenes...

In the end, the perpetrators were caught and punished, but there was no evidence to prove a connection to Mr. Lawrence, so it remained merely in the realm of "rumor."

<b>

<b>

Indeed, the more I investigate Mr. Lawrence, the more suspicious he seems.

It feels like there are an unusually high number of accidental deaths and illnesses around him.

Several owners of rival trading companies also died of illness around the time they were involved with Mr. Lawrence.

Afterward, those trading companies were all absorbed into the Afitrina Trading Company.

<b>

The icing on the cake is that the accident involving Karen's family coincided with a sharp rise in the performance of the Afitrina Trading Company.

Normally, if they were co-managing or providing financial assistance, wouldn't there be some losses if that business stagnated?

<b>

Are all these just coincidences?

<b>

<b>

When we arrived at the checkpoint, we lined up at the end of a long queue, but before we knew it, we were almost at the front.

A carriage displaying a unique emblem passed by our carriage.

It depicted a grotesque figure with the upper body of a woman and the lower body of eight arms.

This represented one of the sea goddesses Afitrina, known for capturing and devouring the ships of the disrespectful with her eight arms.

<b>

That carriage was coming from Karnaflemer. It seemed to be heading toward Dekkenbel, in the opposite direction of us.

From what I could see, it looked like they were passing through the checkpoint without any document checks, as if they had a free pass.

<b>

I leaned my elbow on the carriage window, watching the passing carriage, and unconsciously let out a small sigh.
