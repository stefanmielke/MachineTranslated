# 165 - AnnaMarie's Report.

Mr. Walter Miller.

Mr. Kane Marlin was a college friend of ours, and after graduation, we spent a year together studying business management at a trading company in Granati State.

He is the third son of an old baronet and was pursuing his studies with the goal of establishing a business.

Mr. Kane, who was married to a student, and his wife, Leela, had been in contact with Mr. Walter at that time.

<blank>

He returned to Munanotos in 2405 when his eldest daughter, Karen, was born, and at the same time, the then head of the family retired, leaving Kane as head of the family.

The retired former head ......, or Leela's father, passed away five years later, in 2410.

<blank>

<blank>

Surrounded by mountains, Munanotos was once a prosperous mining area.

However, the mining of the main ore began to decline about 70 years ago, and the country no longer enjoyed the economic boom it had enjoyed until then due to a series of mine closures.

Nevertheless, there was still some revenue from mining, albeit in a small way.

Therefore, it is unlikely that the county's management was at a standstill at that time.

<blank>

In 2416, the year Kane was 34 years old, Walter Miller came to visit him in Munanotos.

Karen was 11 years old the year after the birth of her twin siblings.

The purpose is to invite you to be a co-investor in the launch of a new business and to offer your support.

The investment itself was about 100A, so Mr. Kane readily agreed.

He was also named as a co-owner.

<blank>

A year later, however, the business failed.

Mr. Walter has since disappeared, and his whereabouts are unknown to this day.

<blank>

As a co-owner of the business and the head of Munanotos, I was a guarantor, and the collection of compensation was directed to the county administration.

He was on the verge of having some of his mines foreclosed, but thanks to his wife's leadership, he managed to avoid giving up the mountains. However, the amount of debt was so large that the county was on the verge of going out of business.

Then, in 2418, an earthquake struck the mountains of Munanotos, crushing several of the mines.

<blank>

The cause is volcanic activity at Rohan Volcano.

At that time, Bortosnan, a neighbor of Munanotos, which has the Rohan volcano, was also severely damaged.

It took two years for Bortosnán, which was located in the vicinity of the volcano and had a major source of income from hot springs and tourism revenue, to recover from the damage at this time.

However, I believe that the fact that the city of Magnumtor, which was on the verge of destruction, was able to be rebuilt in just two years is due to the extraordinary passion and blood-soaked efforts of the head of Boltzunan for its recovery.

<blank>

Several mines in Munanotos, a stretch of mountains and peaks connected to the Rohan volcano, were crushed by the earthquake.

The company was unable to allocate funds for reconstruction due to the loss of revenue from the mine, and just when it appeared that the company's finances would finally come to a standstill, a loan proposal and an offer to redevelop the mine were made.

<blank>

The person with whom he was speaking was Mr. Lawrence Niven of Grouse Mill.

Niven suggested that one of the mines in Munanotos may contain a vein of mithril.

<blank>

He wanted permission to survey a large vein of ore and to be named as a co-developer once it was discovered. Furthermore, he offered Mr. Kane a contract on the condition that he would be fully entrusted with the sales channels.

<blank>

Kane accepted and the contract was signed shortly after.

<blank>

Eventually, a vein of mithril was claimed to have been discovered, and large-scale mining operations were set to begin.

However, when Mr. Kane and his wife, Leela, visited the mining site to inspect the site before mining began, there was an unfortunate cave-in accident, and the couple were involved in the accident and did not return home.

<blank>

Mr. Niven has now taken over the business, but there is still no timetable for the start of mining.

He closes the thin bundle of reports in his hand and exhales a long, quiet breath.

This report, prepared by AnnaMarie, was given to me when I returned to the school from the bouncer association, and although this is not the first time I have read it, I can't help but let out a sigh after reading through it.

<blank>

<blank>

Now we have been waiting for nearly an hour at the county border to get permission for this carriage.

<blank>

Most county borders have a barrier like this.

The town of Masom in Amkam is also a barrier.

Masom, however, is much more secure than here due to the special nature of Amkam.

Compared to that, the customs here have nothing to complain about, as they can pass through with a mere paperwork check.

<blank>

But I picked up this report just because I had time, and I think again that it is not something to look at just to kill time.

<blank>

<blank>

The report also included a lot about Lawrence Niven, the man in question.

<blank>

The Niven family was originally one of the parishioners who took over a fallen countship.

Grouse Mill, which had no outstanding local products, was a land that was managed by earning profits from trade with foreign countries.

<blank>

Mr. Lawrence is the son-in-law of the Niven family because of his management skills.

However, as the then head and his wife died suddenly in a shipping accident soon after they were registered, Mr. Lawrence succeeded him as head of the company.

<blank>

Immediately after becoming head of the company, Lawrence reorganized the trading companies that had existed until then and established the "Grand Chamber of Commerce of Aphitrina" as it exists today.

The trading company performed steadily and increased its size many times over in a few years.

It was around that time that their first son was born. However, his wife, who was often ill, died at the same time as the birth of their first son.

Years later, he remarried to a cousin of his former wife. This person is the mother of the second son.

But he is also prone to illness and is now resting in a convalescent home.

<blank>

<blank>

It is said that Mr. Lawrence's business practices are famous for being quite aggressive.

Threatening deals and forced mergers and acquisitions are commonplace. He is said to be a man who is constantly the subject of black rumors.

I heard that when the house of the business rival of the Grand Chamber of Commerce of Aphitrina was attacked by a gang of robbers and the entire family was wiped out, there were whisperings that Mr. Lawrence was pulling the strings behind the scenes. ......

The perpetrator was eventually caught and punished, but his connection to Mr. Lawrence was never proven, and since there was no evidence, the case never left the realm of "rumor.

<blank>

<blank>

The more I look into this Mr. Lawrence, the more I can smell the stench of something fishy about him.

I feel like there are so many accidental deaths and illnesses around me.

Several owners of former rival trading houses also died of illness at the same time they became involved with Mr. Lawrence.

After that, all of their business associations were absorbed by the Grand Chamber of Commerce of Aphitrina.

<blank>

To top it all off, around the time of the accident at Karen's parents' house, the business performance of the Aphitrina Grand Chamber of Commerce has skyrocketed.

Normally, if you were jointly managing or funding a business, wouldn't there be a certain amount of loss if that business stalled?

<blank>

Are these all coincidences?

<blank>

<blank>

When we arrived at the gate, we were at the end of a long line, but before we knew it, it was almost our turn.

A carriage with a unique coat of arms passed by our carriage.

A deformed figure with a female upper body and an eight-armed lower body.

It is a manifestation of one of the pillars of the sea goddess Aphitrina, who has a terrible legend that she seizes and devours with her eight arms any ship in which an ungodly person rides.

<blank>

That carriage is the one that leaves from Karnaframel. It seems to be going to Dekenberu in the opposite direction from us.

As far as I could see, there was no sign of document screening at the barrier, and it looked like they came out with a face-pass.

<blank>

I leaned my elbow on the carriage window and let out a small sigh as I looked out at the passing carriage.
