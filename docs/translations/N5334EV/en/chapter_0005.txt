"How do you like it?　Can you stand up like this?"

No, I can't!　I can't!　What is this?　I can't get any power into it!

Oh, don't try to force it, or you'll mess it up."

Oh, oh, really?　Well..."

Now that you've released unnecessary tension by massaging around the spine, keep it that way... like this... and this... and this... and this!　And, how is it?　You can stand up, can't you?"

I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it!　Amazing!　You're standing up with no effort..."

Now you are standing on your skeletal balance alone. Remember this sensation."

I'm feeling a swooshy sensation in my core like I've been coated in mentum...is this what you call an axis?"

Yes, that's it. It's a sensation you can feel if the muscles around you are not under unnecessary tension. Remember that."

I can't get this feeling just by reading books. I can't get it unless I learn it directly from you. But I feel like I've known this feeling for a long time...I should have known it, but why did I forget it until now? I don't know why I forgot about it until now.

When I was a toddler, everyone had this feeling of standing on balance alone. Once you get into the habit of standing on your muscles, you lose it.

I see...you mean people just forget."

If you grow up and start sports with that sense of balance, you will be able to perform at a high level. If you keep that sense of balance and grow up and start playing sports, you will be able to perform at a high level. It's the dividing line between a genius and an ordinary person.

I'm not sure!　So if I start training like this, can I still aim for a medal or something?"

I don't know.　I think it depends on the way you hit it.　More importantly, that condition will return to normal in another half hour or so?"

What?　What?　Are you serious?

It's only temporary! There's no way you can get rid of the physical habits you've developed over the years so easily.

I see~~ I know..."

Don't forget that feeling. Take time to correct your habits and rebuild your body.

<blank>

Early the next morning, we left our encampment at the watering hole.

<blank>

The "merchant's pot" from the query item was useful for securing water.

<blank>

There were over 100 of these items, so I dutifully pumped water into about 50 of them and re-stored them in my inventory.

<blank>

One jar held more than 10 liters.

Since it is said that a person uses 3 liters of water per day for daily use, we thought it was too much, but we should prepare it when we can, so we stored it as it was.

<blank>

From the time we left the water station to the foot of the mountain range, we realized that we had traveled what we thought was 100 kilometers in less than an hour.

During that time, I ran, jumped, and ran around.

<blank>

Normally, in a dream, running is slow and you don't make as much progress as you'd like, but in this dream, it was the opposite!　It's a lucid dream!　This dream is amazing!

<blank>

I realized once again the cheat of my physical ability or the unreasonableness of my dream, and kept running, shouting as if I was moved.

<blank>

When Suzy runs as fast as she can, the trees around her are reaped by the shockwave, and when she jumps, the ground she steps on and the point where she lands take heavy damage. She is a running crater maker at the best of times.

<blank>

If we see a mob on the way, we try out our skills and destroy it, so we can clearly see the path to this point.

<blank>

Now I don't have to worry about getting lost anymore!　Yeah, yeah!

<blank>

Is that the issue?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now we were already out of the forest and walking through the open plateau area.

<blank>

The elevation had increased considerably, and the forested area where we had been until this morning could be seen behind us.

The forest can be seen stretching far and wide.

<blank>

Now, a slope that is by no means gentle rises up in front of us.

The meadow, rocky in places, rose up like a wall, and the white mountains still rose beyond it.

<blank>

To the left, to the west, was a coniferous forest, and white clouds drifted just above our heads.

<blank>

What is this place?　Is it a castle in the sky?　A swing!　I demand a giant swing!　I'm already feeling like an Alps girl!

<blank>

As it was, he did not stop to admire the surrounding landscape, but climbed the slope in front of him in one breath.

<blank>

I think it's about 2,000 meters above sea level.　I can also head straight north to ......!　How do you know the elevation and direction?　Am I a bird?　I'm a migratory bird!　I'm a migratory bird!

<blank>

There seems to be some kind of strange tension.

<blank>

<blank>

As we crested the grade, a huge lake spread out before us.

<blank>

From the left, the coniferous forest continues from below, from the right, the green peaks overflow with greenery, and in front of the mountain range rises a far white mountain range still deep in snow like a wall.

<blank>

Against the backdrop of a sky-blue sky with no trace of paint poured directly into it, the lake was full of water, its surface reflecting the sunlight and shimmering like it was covered with jewels.

<blank>

A mass of clouds drifted low and close to the surface of the water. All the scenery in sight was reflected in the mirror-like surface of the lake.

All of this was now in full view in front of Susie's eyes.

<blank>

"............ what's this?　This is ......."

<blank>

Climbing all the way up at once, the view in front of you will overwhelm you and take your breath away.

<blank>

"Such a ...... dreamy view that you only see on such a ...... monitor like this ....... It's really there...... no!　It's just a dream!"

<blank>

Sighing deeply with a "ho......", he muttered to no one in particular.

<blank>

I had a lot of thoughts about it, but after seeing this, it doesn't matter anymore. But after seeing this, it doesn't matter anymore...... ...... I'm going to leave it here for today. Yeah, I like it here!　Let's camp here!　I'm going to camp here!　Let's ...... camp here!

<blank>

What are you going to do?

<blank>

In the meantime, I sensed a hostile reaction gathering around me.

<blank>

Aaaaaaahhhh ...... you're still here! I need to clean up for safe encampment, right?　We have to do it right!　We have to do it right!　We have to do it right so that we can be at peace!

<blank>

So what are you going to do?

<blank>

"There's quite a few of them here. ...... I don't want to pollute the waterside, so let's get out of here, shall we?"

<blank>

When he said this, he bounced a ton ton ton ton and moved a few dozen meters away from the lakeshore.

<blank>

Following Suzy, the group of mobs moved again and followed.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the process of going through the deep-sea forest this time, I found out some things through battles with various mobs.

<blank>

If they find you here, they will attack you without question.

<blank>

If we don't touch them, they will go away without a hitch.

<blank>

The basic "active" is a carnivore.

'Non-active' is considered herbivorous.

<blank>

Even the most herbivorous individuals are territorial and will attack if they enter their territory.

So I can't judge it by looks alone. ......

<blank>

For now, I will try not to touch "non-ac" as much as possible.

We would crush the "active" who recognized us as bait and attacked us! This was our policy.

<blank>

The mobs that are gathering now are "active" and look carnivorous, so I'm going to grind them down!

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmm, I bet there's two or three hundred of them.　"Highland Gremlins. ......"

<blank>

A black mass wriggles and crawls around Suzy.

<blank>

<blank>

The Highland Gremlin is a black ogre only 4 to 50 centimeters tall.

<blank>

They have short crab legs, long arms and long, sharp, dirty claws on their hands and feet.

His face is flat like a frog, and his ears, which are more than half of his face, are long and pointed.

Its mouth was ripped open to the ears, and yellowing fangs peeking out of its mouth were lined up in a messy row and protruding.

The eyes are long and narrow and yellow, and the pupils are like vertical lines that keep scurrying around busily.

From its forehead to the back of its head, small horns grew in a row like a crest, and its skin was covered with black scales and had a slimy, shiny sheen.

<blank>

<blank>

Hundreds of them gathered around Susie, creating a space about five meters in diameter and a black wall that was closing in on her.

<blank>

<blank>

Zawari and countless yellow eyes glow.

One of them, who was at the very front of the group, screamed as if he couldn't wait any longer and jumped out vigorously with drool spilling out of his mouth.

<blank>

But that guy jumped up and almost at the same time, he popped off.

<blank>

As if on cue, the kobolds began jumping on them like a dam.

But all of them pop up in the air.

One after another, countless kobolds explode like water balloons.

<blank>

The kobolds exploded and disappeared, unable to reach Suzy, as if there was an invisible wall there.

<blank>

<blank>

Yo! Ha! Get off! Bastard! Hey!

<blank>

Suzy strikes down one kobold after another as they fly by, one after the other, with her sword.

<blank>

Konya! Blood! Count! One! A lot! Big! Dropping! Oh, my God!

<blank>

The kobolds pop off one after another, to the right, to the left, diagonally, and upward.

The edge of the sword becomes an afterimage, a line of light.

<blank>

Nyoho! Nyoo-hoo! Meow! Ho ho ho! Myoo! Nyahyah!

<blank>

Soon the flesh and blood of the kobolds that kept pouncing on them piled up like coal tar, creating a black wall.

<blank>

No! Unh! Unh! Raw! Gag! Fuck!

<blank>

Suzy wrinkled her nose but continued to beat the kobold.

<blank>

Mwah! Unh! Mene! Do it! Ow! Ow! I don't care! One! Put it on! Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

<blank>

He stopped his sword for a moment, and then dropped to his haunches as if to gather strength.

<blank>

Blow up, Real!

<blank>

≪Extensive shocks.

Enchanted channeler ranged attack skills.

This skill releases a shockwave centered on the surgeon, and has a debuff effect that lowers defense and evasion along with the damage.

<blank>

<blank>

A huge explosion sounded, and the impact, centered on Suzy, spread out over a radius of more than ten meters and blew away all the surviving kobolds into tiny pieces, along with the wall of flesh and blood.

<blank>

Phew!　It's cleaned up ah!　Even for ......!　I've been moving around for such a long time and I haven't lost my breath. ......, this is something that only dreams can do.

<blank>

<blank>

Looking around, black flesh and blood was splattered over a fairly large area.

It is a horrific site spread out in the midst of a healing wilderness.

<blank>

The sight of blood and flesh scattered all over the place is quite gruesome, isn't it?　It's like a nightmare at 2,000 meters above sea level!　And I'm not talking about on a passenger plane!

<blank>

It's a tough story.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I stretched one more time!　I stretched out one more time.

<blank>

I'm done!　Let's take a bath!　We've got to get rid of that funny smell!

<blank>

Stow the equipment in your inventory as you drive out toward the lake.

He took off his underwear at the lakeshore and ran straight into the water.

<blank>

I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　It feels even better than I thought it would!　I feel soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo liberated!"

<blank>

Soon, the unmistakable sound of their charming voices echoed across the highland lakes.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In a tent, wrapped in a fur-lined blanket, it wriggled and wriggled and wriggled and wriggled and wriggled to stay warm.

<blank>

I can't get out of this comfort after all! Even in my dreams, the warmth of the blanket does me justice!"

<blank>

And then he pulled his face and shoulders out of the blanket, raised his right hand directly above his head, and looked at that hand. ......

<blank>

"This is a dream, right ......?　Don't tell me this isn't a story about you and a woman switching consciousnesses in a dream,......?"

<blank>

I raised my left hand as well and thrust both hands upward.

<blank>

If that were the case, I'd die in agony if it were known that I'd repeatedly committed such lewd acts.

<blank>

With a pat, he lowered his hands without effort.

<blank>

I knew it!　I knew it! I've already slept for two nights and it's still like this. First of all, this is a game character. ...... It's too unrealistic to think that such a cheat body exists in real life.

<blank>

I put my arms inside the blanket, hugged my shoulders and laid my body down.

<blank>

"Sleeping in a dream and even dreaming ...... or it's surreal, but I guess it's lucid dreaming so it's possible ....... I don't know when I'm going to wake up, but it's ...... nice to watch ...... a little more ............ ...or...."

<blank>

Soon, they began to make little sleeping sounds in their tents.

<blank>

<blank>

The sky is full of stars that seem to be falling outside.

<blank>

A blue-tinted moon gently peeks out from behind a small red-tinted moon.

The moons reflected in the mirror-like surface of the highland lake, facing each other and illuminating together the small tents set up on the lakeshore.
