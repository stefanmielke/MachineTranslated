# Episode 05 - Enjoying Lake Suzi Plateau

“How is it? Can you stand like this?”

“No, I can't! What is this? I can't put any strength into it at all!”

"Oh, please don't try to force yourself. It will ruin it.”

“Oh, is that so? I see...“

”Now that you've had the unnecessary tension taken away by the massage around your spine, while maintaining that state... like this... like this! How is it? You can stand, right?“

”Whoa! That's amazing! I'm standing without putting any effort in...”

“You're standing right now just by balancing your skeletal structure. Please don't forget this feeling.“

”I feel like I've got some kind of momentum running through the core of my body... Is this what you mean by 'axis'?

"Yes, that's it. You can feel it if the muscles around you aren't tensing up unnecessarily. Please don't forget that feeling.”

“You can't learn something like this just by reading books, you have to be taught directly. But somehow, it feels like I've known this feeling for a long time... I'm sure I knew it, but why did I forget about it until now?

"Everyone had this feeling when they were young and standing on their own balance. Once you get into the habit of standing on your muscles, you lose this feeling.”

“I see, so it's just that everyone has forgotten about it.“

”If you grow up and start playing sports while retaining that sense, you'll be able to achieve high performance. Your sense of balance is different from everyone else's. I guess you could say it's the dividing line between genius and ordinary people.“

”Wow, so if I start training now, I could even aim for a medal?”

“I don't know about that. It depends on how you hit the ball, I think. But more importantly, that condition will return to normal in about half an hour.“

”What? Are you serious?!“

”It's only temporary! You can't just get rid of the physical habits you've developed over the years that easily.“

”I see... that's right...”

“Don't forget that feeling. Take your time to correct your habits and rebuild your body."

<blank>

The next morning, we left the campsite by the water.

<blank>

Securing water was made easy by the 'Merchant's Jar' item I found in the quest item.

<blank>

Since I had over 100 of these items, I collected about 50 of them and stored them in my inventory.

<blank>

Each jar held over 10 liters.

It is said that the amount of water people use in a day is 3 liters, so it was a lot, but I thought I should prepare it when I could, so I stored it as it was.

<blank>

From the water source to the foot of the mountain range, I had thought the journey would be 100 kilometers, but I had covered it in less than an hour.

During that time, I ran, jumped, and ran around.

<blank>

“Normally, when you're running in a dream, you move slowly and can't progress as you want, but this dream is the opposite! As expected of a lucid dream! It's unbelievable!”

<blank>

He was running, shouting in amazement as he realized once again how cheat his physical abilities were, and how unreasonable dreams were.

<blank>

When Suzy ran at full speed, the trees around her were knocked over by the shockwave, and when she jumped, the ground she stepped on and the landing spot took a lot of damage. She was now a crater-making machine on the run.

<blank>

If she saw a mob on the way, she would test out her skills and annihilate them, and she had definitely carved out a gruesome path, so she could clearly see the path she had taken up to this point.

<blank>

“Now you won't get lost! Yeah yeah!”

<blank>

Is that the problem?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

We had already left the forest and were now walking through a wide, open plateau.

<blank>

The altitude had risen considerably, and we could see the forest area where we had been until this morning in the distance.

You can see that the forest stretches far into the distance.

<blank>

Now, a slope that is by no means gentle is stretching up before you.

The grassland, with rocks sticking out here and there, rises up like a wall, and beyond that, the still white mountains tower.

<blank>

To the left, which was to the west, a coniferous forest spread out, and white clouds drifted right above my head.

<blank>

"What is this place? Is it a castle in the sky? I demand a giant swing! I feel like a girl from the Alps!

<blank>

Without stopping to admire the scenery around him, he climbed the slope in front of him in one breath.

<blank>

“I think it's about 2,000 meters above sea level. I can head straight north too... Wait, how do I know the altitude and direction? Am I a bird? A migratory bird? A pixie?!"

<blank>

He seems to be in some kind of strange mood.

<blank>

<blank>

After climbing the slope, a huge lake stretched out before me.

<blank>

From the left, a coniferous forest continued from below, from the right, green-filled peaks rose up, and in front of me, a distant range of white mountains, still deep in snow, towered up like a wall.

<blank>

Against a sky of pure sky blue, as if the paint had been poured in as it was, the lake was full to the brim with water, and the surface of the water reflected the sunlight, glittering like it was covered in jewels.

<blank>

A mass of clouds was floating low near the surface of the water. All the scenery that spread out in front of her eyes was reflected in the surface of the lake, which was like a mirror.

Right now, everything was spread out before Susie's eyes.

<blank>

“What is this...?”

<blank>

She climbed to the top in one go, and was so overwhelmed by the scenery before her that she gasped involuntarily.

<blank>

“This... This is like a dream-like landscape that you only see on a monitor... It really exists... No, it's a dream!"

<blank>

I muttered to myself as I let out a deep sigh.

<blank>

“I had a lot of things on my mind, but... now that I've seen this, it doesn't matter anymore... I don't care anymore... I'm going to camp here for today... Yeah, this is a good place! Let's camp here! Yeah, let's... let's do it here!"

<blank>

What are they going to do?

<blank>

While they were doing this, they sensed that hostile reactions were gathering around them.

<blank>

“Ahh...As I thought, they're here. In order to camp in peace, we need to clean up, right? We need to do it properly, so that we can relax!

<blank>

So what are you going to do?

<blank>

“There's quite a few of them gathering... I don't want to get the water dirty, so let's move away a bit, okay?”

<blank>

With that, he jumped up and down a few times and moved a few dozen meters away from the lakeshore.

<blank>

Following Susie's lead, the Mob group also moved again and started to chase after him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In order to get through the deep sea forest this time, I learned a few things from fighting various mobs.

<blank>

The 'active' type will attack without question if they spot you.

<blank>

The 'non-active' type will pass by without incident if you don't attack them.

<blank>

Basically, the 'active' type are carnivores.

The 'non-active' type are thought to be herbivores.

<blank>

Even herbivores with a strong sense of territory will attack if you enter their territory.

So you can't judge them just by looking at them...

<blank>

For now, I'll avoid the 'non-active' ones as much as possible.

I've been following the policy of crushing the 'active' ones that recognize me as food and attack me!

<blank>

The mobs that are gathering now are 'active' and look like they're carnivorous, so I'll crush them all!

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmm, there must be 200 or 300 of them. ‘Highland Gremlins’...”

<blank>

A black mass wriggles and crawls around Suzy.

<blank>

<blank>

'Highland Gremlins' are black little demons that are only about 40 to 50 centimeters tall.

<blank>

It has short, bowlegged legs, long arms, and long, sharp fingernails.

Its face is flat like a frog's, and its ears, which are longer than half its face, are long and pointy.

Its mouth splits all the way to its ears, and yellow fangs poke out of its mouth in a messy line.

Its eyes were long and narrow, and its pupils looked like lines running vertically, which it kept moving restlessly.

From its forehead to the back of its head, small horns grew in a row like a crest, and its skin was covered in black scales and had a shiny, slippery sheen.

<blank>

<blank>

Hundreds of them gathered around Suzy, leaving a space of about 5 meters in diameter, and came rushing towards her, forming a black wall.

<blank>

<blank>

A rustling sound could be heard as countless yellow eyes glowed.

The one in the front let out a cry as if it couldn't wait any longer, and it jumped out vigorously, drooling from its mouth.

<blank>

However, it burst apart almost as soon as it jumped up.

<blank>

As if on cue, the imps began to jump at it like a dam bursting.

However, all of them burst apart in mid-air.

One after another, countless imps burst apart like water balloons.

<blank>

The little demons disappeared without reaching Suzy, as if there was an invisible wall there.

<blank>

<blank>

“Yoh!”, “Hah!”, “Torya!”, “Kon!”, “Tii!

<blank>

Suzy beats the goblins flying at her one after another with her sword.

<blank>

“Konda!”, “Ketsu!”, “Satsu!”, “Itt!”, “Rutto!”, “Daii!”, “Sogashi!”, “Danna!

<blank>

The little demons fly off one after another, to the right, to the left, diagonally, and upwards.

The edge of the sword leaves a trail of light.

<blank>

“Hoh!”, “Nyohoh!”, “Konya!”, “Hoh!”, “Myoh!”, “Nyunya!

<blank>

Eventually, the blood and flesh of the little demons, who continued to jump at each other endlessly, piled up like coal tar, creating a dark, murky wall.

<blank>

“Nuh!”, “Uuh!”, “Nuh!”, “Ii!”, “Guu!”, “Sassaii!

<blank>

Suzy continued to hit the little demons, even as she wrinkled her nose.

<blank>

“Moooo!”, “Uuu!”, “Men!”, “Doo!”, “Daaaa!”, “Ii!”, “Ki ni!”, “Kata!”, “Tsuke!”, “Ruruuuuu!!!”

<blank>

He stopped his sword for a moment and lowered his hips as if to gather strength.

<blank>

“Explode, reality!”

<blank>

≪Extensive Shock≫

An area-of-effect skill of the Enchanted Channeler.

It is a skill that releases a shockwave centered on the user, and has a debuff effect that lowers defense and evasion along with the damage.

<blank>

<blank>

A huge explosion echoed out, and the shock wave that spread out from Suzy's body over a radius of several dozen meters blew away all the remaining goblins, along with the walls of flesh and blood, reducing them to dust.

<blank>

“Puha! It's all over! ...Even so, though! After moving around like that for so long, not even a hint of breathlessness... This is only a dream, isn't it?"

<blank>

<blank>

Looking around, I see that the black blood and flesh has scattered over a fairly wide area.

It's a gruesome scene spread out in the healing wilderness.

<blank>

“Hmm, the sight of blood and flesh scattered about is pretty gruesome! It's like a nightmare at 2,000 meters above sea level! It's not on a passenger plane though!"

<blank>

It's a difficult topic.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

He stretched out.

<blank>

“Alright, it's all done! Let's go for a bath! I need to wash off that weird smell!”

<blank>

As he started running towards the lake, he stored his equipment in his inventory.

He took off his underwear at the lakeshore and ran straight into the water.

<blank>

“Hmm...!! It feels even better than I thought! The sense of freedom is amazing!”

<blank>

Before long, the sound of their unrestrained laughter echoes across the highland lake.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Inside the tent, he was lying on a blanket covered in fur, wriggling around and warming himself up.

<blank>

“I can't get over how comfortable this is. Even in my dreams, the warmth of a blanket is justice!”

<blank>

He poked his face and shoulders out from under the blanket, raised his right hand straight up, and stared at it...

<blank>

“This is a dream, right? It's not like I'm dreaming that I've switched bodies with a girl, is it?“

<blank>

I raised my left hand too and stuck both hands out above my head.

<blank>

”If that's the case, I'd die in agony if they found out I'd been doing this kind of indecent thing so many times."

<blank>

I let my hands fall limply.

<blank>

“No way! That's not going to happen. I've been sleeping for two nights now, and it's still like this. Besides, this is a game character... There's no way a body like this could exist in real life. It's too unrealistic.”

<blank>

I put my arms under the blanket and laid down, hugging my shoulders.

<blank>

“I'm sleeping in a dream, and even dreaming... It's surreal, but I guess it's okay because it's a lucid dream... I don't know when I'll wake up, but... can I... keep watching for a little while longer...?”

<blank>

Before long, he began to make small snoring sounds inside the tent.

<blank>

<blank>

Outside, the sky was full of stars that looked like they might fall down at any moment.

<blank>

A bluish moon gently peeks its face out from behind the reddish little moon.

The moons are reflected in the mirror-like surface of the highland lake, facing each other and illuminating the small tent placed by the lakeside.
