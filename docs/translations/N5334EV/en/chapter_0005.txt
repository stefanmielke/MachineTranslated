# Episode 05: Enjoying the Suzi Highlands Lake

"How is it? Can you stand in this state?"

"N-no! It's impossible! What is this? I can't put any strength into it at all!?"

"Oh, please don't try to force it; it'll ruin everything."

"O-oh, is that so? I see..."

"Right now, thanks to the massage around your spine, unnecessary tension has been released, so maintain that state... like this... and then, like this! How about it? You can stand, right?"

"Whoa! Amazing! I'm standing without using any strength..."

"You're standing purely based on skeletal balance right now. Please don't forget this sensation."

"I feel like there's a cool, menthol-like sensation in the core of my body... is this what they call an axis?"

"Yes, that's it. It's a sensation you can recognize when the surrounding muscles aren't tense unnecessarily. Don't forget that."

"I could never do something like this just by reading about it in books; it's a feeling you can only understand by being taught directly like this. But, somehow, it feels like I've known this sensation for a long time... like I should know it, but I don't know why I forgot until now?"

"That's a sensation everyone had when they were toddlers standing purely on balance. Once you develop the habit of standing with your muscles, you lose that awareness."

"I see~ So everyone just forgets it, huh?"

"If you grow up while maintaining that sensation and start doing sports, you'll achieve high performance. Your sense of balance will be different from others. It's the dividing line between genius and ordinary people."

"Whoa! So if I start some training like this, can I aim for medals too?"

"Well, I wonder? It depends on how you practice, I suppose? More importantly, that state will revert back to normal in about 30 minutes."

"W-what!? Seriously!?"

"It's just temporary! The habits your body has developed over many years won't just disappear that easily."

"I see~~ You're right..."

"Make sure you don't forget that sensation. Take your time to correct your habits and rebuild your body."

<b>

<b>

The next morning, I set off from the campsite near the water.

<b>

The 'Merchant's Jar' from the quest items proved useful for securing water.

<b>

Since I had over 100 of these items, I filled about 50 with water and stored them in my inventory.

<b>

Each jar held over 10 liters.

It's said that a person uses about 3 liters of water for daily living, so it's an excessive amount, but I thought it would be best to prepare it while I could, so I stored it as is.

<b>

After departing from the water source, I realized I had covered the distance to the foot of the mountain range, which I estimated to be about 100 kilometers, in just under an hour.

During that time, I ran, jumped, and dashed around relentlessly.

<b>

"Usually, in dreams, running is slow and you can't progress as you wish, but this dream is the opposite! As expected of a lucid dream!! It's incredibleーーー!!"

<b>

I continued running while shouting in amazement, realizing once again the cheat-like nature of my physical abilities or the absurdity of the dream.

<b>

When Suzi ran at full speed, the surrounding trees were knocked down by shockwaves, and when I jumped, the ground I stepped on and the landing spot took significant damage. I was practically a crater-making machine.

<b>

Whenever I spotted a mob along the way, I tested my skills and annihilated them, clearly marking the path I had taken.

<b>

"Now I don't have to worry about getting lost! Yes, yes!"

<b>

Is that really the issue?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Now I had already exited the forest and was walking through a vast plateau area.

<b>

The altitude had risen significantly, and I could see the forested area I had been in earlier far below.

I could tell that the forest stretched far into the distance.

<b>

Before me, a steep slope rose sharply.

Grasslands with protruding rocks jutted up like walls, and beyond them, the still snow-covered distant mountains towered.

<b>

To the left, which was west, coniferous forests spread out, and white clouds flowed just above my head.

<b>

"What is this place!!? Is it a castle in the sky!? I demand a swing! A giant swing! I feel like a girl from the Alps now?!!!"

<b>

While I was captivated by the surrounding scenery, I didn't stop my feet and climbed the slope in one breath.

<b>

"Is this about 2,000 meters above sea level? I can head straight north too... wait! How do I know the altitude and direction? Am I a bird!? A migratory bird!? I'm pitchy, right?!!"

<b>

I seemed to be in a strange mood.

<b>

<b>

After reaching the top of the slope, a gigantic lake spread out before me.

<b>

From the left, the coniferous forest continued from below, from the right, green peaks overflowed, and directly ahead, the distant white mountain ranges still deep in snow loomed like walls.

<b>

Against a sky blue background that looked like paint poured directly, the lake brimmed with water, and its surface sparkled like jewels reflecting sunlight.

<b>

A mass of clouds drifted low near the water's surface. Every scene in my view was mirrored on the lake's surface like a mirror.

Now, everything was spread out before Suzi's eyes.

<b>

"........What is this...?"

<b>

Having reached the top in one go, I was overwhelmed by the scenery before me and couldn't help but gasp.

<b>

"...This... this is a dream-like scenery that you only see on a monitor... It really exists... No! It's a dream, though!!"

<b>

I let out a deep sigh, murmuring to no one in particular.

<b>

"Well, I had a lot of thoughts, but after seeing this, I don't care anymore... I'm fine here today... Yes, this is good! Let's camp here!! Yes! Let's do it... here, let's do it!!"

<b>

What will I do?

<b>

While I was thinking this, I sensed hostile reactions gathering around me.

<b>

"Ahhh... I knew they were here... To camp peacefully, I need to clean up! Yes!! I have to do it properly! So I can do it without worry!!!"

<b>

So what am I planning to do?

<b>

"A considerable number are gathering... I don't want the waterside to get dirty, so let's move a little away?"

<b>

Saying that, I hopped away from the lakeshore, taking a distance of several dozen meters.

<b>

Following Suzi's lead, the mob also moved again to chase after me.

<b>

<b>

<b>

While passing through the deep sea forest this time, I learned a few things from battling various mobs.

<b>

If they spot me, they will attack without question; that's the 'active' type.

If I don't engage, they will pass by without doing anything; that's the 'non-active' type.

<b>

Basically, 'active' types are carnivorous.

'Non-active' types are presumed to be herbivorous.

<b>

However, even among herbivores, individuals with a strong territorial instinct will attack if I enter their territory.

So, I can't judge solely by appearance...

<b>

For now, I decided not to engage with the 'non-active' types.

I would crush the 'active' types that recognize me as prey!

<b>

The mobs gathering now are 'active' and clearly carnivorous, so I will crush them thoroughly!

<b>

<b>

"Hmm, there are probably 200 to 300 of them? 'Highland Gremlins'..."

<b>

A mass of black figures swarmed around Suzi, rustling and wriggling as they approached.

<b>

'Highland Gremlins' are small black goblins only about 40 to 50 centimeters tall.

<b>

They have short, crab-like legs and long arms, with dirty, sharp claws.

Their faces are flat like a frog, and their long, pointed ears make up more than half of their faces.

Their mouths are split up to their ears, revealing yellowed teeth that protrude haphazardly.

Their eyes are long and yellow, with pupils that look like vertical lines, constantly darting around.

From their foreheads to the back of their heads, small horns grow like a crest, and their skin is covered in black scales, glistening with a slimy sheen.

<b>

<b>

Hundreds of them gathered around Suzi, creating a black wall as they approached, leaving a space of about 5 meters in diameter.

<b>

<b>

Countless yellow eyes glimmered ominously.

One of them at the front, unable to wait any longer, let out a scream and lunged forward, drooling from its mouth.

<b>

However, it burst apart almost simultaneously with its jump.

<b>

As if that was a signal, the little goblins began to leap at me like a dam breaking.

But all of them exploded in mid-air.

One after another, countless little goblins burst like water balloons.

<b>

The little goblins couldn't reach Suzi, as if there was an invisible wall, and they burst and disappeared.

<b>

"Yo! Ha! Toriya!! This! Ti!"

<b>

Suzi swung her sword, knocking back the little goblins one after another.

<b>

"Kon da! Ke! Su! I! Ru to!! Ooi! Sogashi! Da na!!"

<b>

They exploded in all directions—right, left, diagonally, and upward.

The edge of the sword left afterimages, drawing lines of light.

<b>

"Hoh! Nyoho! Koniya! Hoh! Myo! Nyunya!!"

<b>

Eventually, the blood and flesh of the endlessly leaping little goblins piled up like coal tar, forming a dark wall.

<b>

"Nu! Uu! Nu! Nama! Gu! Ssai!!!"

<b>

Suzi continued to strike down the little goblins, wrinkling her nose.

<b>

"Mo! U! Men! Dou! Da!! I! Ki ni! Kata! Tsuke! Ruru!!!"

<b>

For a moment, she stopped her sword and crouched down as if gathering strength.

<b>

"Explode, real!!"

<b>

≪Extensive Shock≫

An area attack skill of the Enchant Channeler.

It releases shockwaves centered on the caster, inflicting damage and applying a debuff effect that lowers defense and evasion.

<b>

<b>

With a massive explosion, the shockwave spread out from Suzi, destroying everything within a radius of several meters, including the wall of blood and flesh, and obliterating all the surviving little goblins.

<b>

"Phew! It's all cleaned up! ...But seriously! After moving around for so long, I haven't even broken a sweat... This is definitely a dream thing."

<b>

Looking around, I saw black blood and flesh scattered over a wide area.

It was a gruesome scene spread out in the healing embrace of nature.

<b>

"Ugh, it's pretty gruesome to have blood and flesh scattered around! It's like a 'nightmare at 2,000 meters above sea level'! Not that I'm on a passenger plane or anything!!"

<b>

That's a tough joke.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Hmm! I stretched out.

<b>

"Alright! It's all cleaned up!! Time for a bath! I need to wash off this weird smell!!"

<b>

As I ran toward the lake, I stored my gear back in my inventory.

I stripped off my underwear at the lakeshore and ran straight into the water.

<b>

"Ahhh! It's even better than I expected!! The feeling of liberation is amazing!!"

<b>

Eventually, my ecstatic voice echoed across the highland lake.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Inside the tent, I was wrapped in fur and blankets, squirming and warming up.

<b>

"This comfort is just irresistible~. Even in a dream, the warmth of a blanket is justice!"

<b>

I poked my face and shoulder out from the blanket, raised my right hand above my head, and stared at it...

<b>

"This is a dream, right...? There's no way I'm switching consciousness with a girl in a dream... right?"

<b>

I raised my left hand too, stretching both hands up.

<b>

"If that's the case, if it gets out that I've been doing all this lewd stuff, I'd die from embarrassment."

<b>

I let my arms drop weakly.

<b>

"That's impossible! There's no way that's happening. I've been sleeping for two nights, and I'm still like this. Besides, this is a game character... There's no way such a cheat-like body exists in reality; it's too unrealistic."

<b>

I tucked my arms into the blanket, turned on my side.

<b>

"Sleeping in a dream and dreaming... it's surreal, but since it's a lucid dream, I guess it's okay... I don't know when I'll wake up, but... maybe a little longer... I can keep watching... is that okay...?"

<b>

Eventually, I began to breathe softly in the tent.

<b>

<b>

Outside, the sky was filled with stars that seemed ready to fall.

<b>

A small reddish moon peeked out from behind a bluish moon.

The moons reflected on the lake's mirror-like surface, facing each other, illuminating the small tent placed by the lakeshore.
