# 110 - Holiday Invitation

Posting earlier than usual... (`...)


----------------

Mild sunshine heralds autumn before noon on a holiday.

The three uncles came to the "big vestibule" as I had told them the day before.

And that was at the same time the store opened!

He's the first customer of the day!

<blank>

Hi, Susie. I see you've gotten used to this place by now."

Really. And the uniform, it looks great on you."

"Sister Sue, you're adorable. ......"

<blank>

Welcome Uncle Liliana, Aunt Liliana, and Annie. Welcome to ......"

<blank>

I knew this because I was told that everyone would show up yesterday, but it is quite embarrassing for my relatives to see me working like this, or in my uniform at the store.

But...! I think it is professional to deal with them as a shopkeeper! I think!

Then he bent firmly at the waist and welcomed his uncles.

<blank>

Of course I am happy that my uncles praise me verbally, but this is also quite embarrassing!

I was so embarrassed that Bibi and Mia were looking at me with their eyes, which added more pressure to my shame! Damn!

My face is so hot! What are you going to do?

<blank>

Still, I think I did a good job of serving.

I feel this way when I see my uncle drinking tea with satisfaction and Annie and my aunt eating chiffon cake with relish.

Well, it's no use being shy forever. We are professionals now, after all! A professional!

<blank>

<blank>

Still, it was a really close call this morning.

We were almost late, you know!

<blank>

Well, there is no time card in this world, so time is surprisingly quite lax.

But but.......! My dear!

Something inside me screams! It's a basic rule to arrive at work 10 minutes before the start of the workday! If you are the one who receives the job, it is a matter of course! That's the way it should be!

<blank>

However..! When I told the ladies I saved from the thugs that I had to leave, it was already five minutes before the start of the workday!

I was in a hurry.

I was in a great hurry!

As I was developing my professionalism, this was an event that should not have been overlooked.

<blank>

The distance from the site to the store is about one kilometer in a straight line! If we had followed the road as usual, we would never have made it in time.

The moment I made that decision, I was carrying Mia on my back and Bibi and Karen on either side of me.

Karen was very surprised when I suddenly took her in my arms, but Bibi sighed in resignation and told her, "It's dangerous, so close your eyes tightly and clench your teeth.

I called out to the three of them, "Let's go," and kicked off the cobblestones, leaped up to the roof of a nearby building, and ran toward the store.

Mia on my back hugged me tightly, but on my chest it was a cushion, which was a very happy sensation for me!

Bibi, held to the right, had her eyes squeezed shut and her body in a defensive position.

Karen on the left seemed to make a weird sound when she jumped up, like "Hahyuu? when she jumped up, but I guess she's OK.

<blank>

Well, it took me less than a minute to get to the restaurant from there, so there was no problem! Hahahaha!

I thought it was .......

I told Bibi, "This is not an emergency! I don't want any more of these things!" He was breathlessly stuffing his face.

Mia said, "It was a miracle I didn't get blown away. ...... I'll have to ask my teacher if there's any windproof magic next time," she said.

Karen said, "Huh? The ground? Huh? Alive ......, that?" And then she mouthed something funny.

<blank>

What? What went wrong?

I don't think there's anything wrong with it, since you were safe and didn't arrive late. ...... hey?

<blank>

<blank>

Well, since today is a special occasion, I thought I would introduce my lovely roommate to my uncles.

<blank>

"Nice to meet you ....... My name is Karen Marlin."

Nice to meet you, I'm Suzy's uncle, Philip Cloud. I've heard a lot about you.

<blank>

When I brought Karen to the house, she greeted her uncle politely, although she looked a little nervous.

In response, my uncle responded with a smile, and my aunt and Annie also responded with smiles.

I dare say Annie's smile is priceless!

Karen's eyes also relax when she sees this. I know exactly how you feel! I know that Karen has a weakness for little girls, too!

<blank>

I guess it must be some kind of a coincidence that Suzy is sharing a room with the daughter of the old baroness of Munanotos."

<blank>

That's what my uncle said as he looked at Karen.

Huh? I thought I had mentioned my roommate but not Karen. ......

But what's the vibe, Uncle, that you know about Karen? Why is that?

<blank>

I wonder, now that we've gotten to know each other, would you be willing to come visit me and Susie at the mansion sometime? I wonder if you and Suzy could come visit me at the mansion sometime?"

<blank>

Oh, Uncle, you're so peculiar! I'm so excited to see you at .......

It's good, isn't it? It's good, isn't it?

<blank>

Uncle! Are you sure you want me to take Karen with me?"

Oh, we'd love to have you. Wouldn't that be nice? Annie."

Yes! Of course! Please come!

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, um, ......, I'm glad you invited me, but I try to spend my days off with my little brother and sister, who are still young. ......

Uncle, Karen has your brother and sister in an institution.

"In the ...... facility? Is it ......, the relatives of the students of Milia, outside ......?"

Uncle?"

<blank>

What's that? Uncle, you've been thinking too much, haven't you?

Is there something about Karen's younger sibling's facility?

Well, the facility in question is certainly not entirely free of problems. ......

<blank>

Hm, if you don't mind my asking, ......, was that facility referred by someone else?"

"...... ah, ha, yes, I was referred to ...... by Niven's little father."

Niven ...... Lawrence Niven. As I recall, Grouse Mill's ...... hmm."

Do you know the Little Father?"

Hmm?" Oh, yes. Mr. Niven is also the head of Grouse Mill and a representative of the Chamber of Commerce. As Consul General of Amkham, I have had some dealings with him."

<blank>

Oh ......, so you're telling me that my uncle is actually acquainted with the father of the second son of that short horse ......?

Kori is an unexpected connection, or maybe the world is small, or maybe Karen and I do have some kind of connection!

While I was thinking this, Bibi came up behind me and said in a quiet voice, "Since you are the next head of AMCAM, I think we will see each other sooner or later!

Guhiiiii? The other party is the current head. And I'm the next head?

Iiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaia! I'm talking about the next head of state, Bibi's fukashi, right? Isn't that right?

I looked at Bibi as if I was clinging to him! He looked at Bibi with a clinging look, and she looked back at him with a stern look that said, "You've got to make up your mind!

<blank>

...... Well, I'll see what I can do about that at some point, umm."

<blank>

After Karen's answer, her uncle blurted out something like that, and then he was thinking about something.

What does your uncle say he is going to do? Is it something to do with the Niven family? Is it a "don't mess with the Cullens so much" kind of thing?

Hmmm...but my uncle is not the type to talk too much about what his children do. Another thing?

<blank>

I hope you will come to my house when you can find the time. If you can find the time, we'd love to have you at our house."

<blank>

Finally, the uncle told Karen that.

<blank>

After that, customers began to trickle in, and after watching us work with satisfaction, my uncles left the store.

When it was time to leave, Donald, the owner, and Alma Marma came out to see us off.

My uncle, the quintessential uncle, has a broad face.

<blank>

By the way, your uncle and Alma knew each other, didn't they?

Should I say, "Quite a veteran here, Sister Alma!" I wonder if I should say.

<blank>

The uncles said they would go shopping and eating on Alfalfa Boulevard afterwards, and then go to check on Irvin and his family in the afternoon.

I heard that it also serves as a greeting to the "sister" in the example.

I would love to meet your "sister" one of these days.

Soon, in a moderately busy time, the morning hours had passed, the hustle and bustle of lunchtime had been weathered, and the clock on the white wall was ticking away the afternoon hours peacefully.

<blank>

Then, as tea time was approaching and I was thinking that the peak of the busyness was about to arrive, a loud voice came from one of the tables.

<blank>

I said, "That's why! I told you to call the person in charge!"

<blank>

Hello? Is something wrong?
