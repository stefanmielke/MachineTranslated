# Chapter 110: Invitation for a Day Off

An earlier post than usual... (`・ω・´)

----------------

A calm sunlight announces autumn on a holiday just before noon.

Three uncles arrived at the "large front yard," as discussed the previous day.

And they arrived right at opening time!

They are the first customers today!

<b>

"Hey, Suzy. You seem to have gotten quite used to this place."

"Really. The uniform suits you very well."

"Sue-nee, you're cute..."

<b>

"Welcome, Uncle, Aunt Liliana, Annie. Thank you for coming..."

<b>

I knew they would show up since they mentioned it yesterday, but it’s quite embarrassing to be seen by family while working and in my uniform like this.

However! I thought that properly serving them as a staff member is what being a professional is all about! So I bent at the waist and welcomed my uncles.

<b>

Of course, I was happy that my uncles praised me, but it was also incredibly embarrassing!!

Seeing me embarrassed, Vivi and Mia were giggling behind me, which only spurred my feelings of shame even more!! Damn it!

My face is super hot! What are you going to do about it—?!

<b>

Still, I think I managed to serve them properly.

Seeing my uncles enjoying their tea and Annie and Aunt Liliana eating the chiffon cake happily made me feel that way.

Well, there's no point in being embarrassed forever. After all, I’m a professional now! A professional!

<b>

<b>

That said, this morning was really close.

I almost ended up being late!

<b>

Well, in this world, there isn’t really a time card system, so the timing is surprisingly quite relaxed.

But still! My inner self screams! It’s basic to arrive at work 10 minutes before starting time! If you’re taking on a job, that’s just common sense!!

<b>

However! By the time I said goodbye to the ladies I helped from the assailant, it was already 5 minutes before starting time!

I panicked.

I panicked a lot!

For someone like me, who has developed a sense of professionalism, this was an event I could not overlook.

<b>

The distance from that scene to the shop is roughly 1 kilometer in a straight line! If I were to go the normal route, I definitely wouldn’t make it in time.

I made that judgment, and in the next moment, I was carrying Mia on my back and had Vivi and Karen tucked under each arm.

Karen was really surprised when I suddenly picked her up, but Vivi sighed as if resigned and told Karen, "Close your eyes tightly and brace yourself because it’s dangerous."

I called out to the three of them, "Let’s go," kicked off the cobblestones, jumped onto the roof of a nearby building, and dashed towards the shop from there.

Mia clung tightly to my back, but that was like a cushion for me, so I felt really happy!

Vivi, on my right, closed her eyes tightly and stiffened her body, getting into a defensive posture.

On the left, Karen made a strange sound like "Hahyu?!" when I jumped, but I thought she would be fine.

<b>

Well, it took less than a minute to reach the shop, so there was no problem at all! Hahaha!

...Or so I thought.

Vivi confronted me, saying, "It’s not even an emergency! I’m never doing this again!!"

Mia said, "It was a miracle that we weren’t blown away... Next time, I’ll have to ask the teacher if there’s a wind protection spell."

Karen was mumbling something strange like, "Huh? The ground? Huh? I’m alive... huh?"

<b>

Huh? What went wrong??

I think there’s no problem since I didn’t end up being late...

<b>

<b>

Well, more than that, since it’s a rare opportunity today, I thought I would introduce my cute roommate to my uncles.

<b>

"…N-Nice to meet you. I’m Karen Merlin."

"Nice to meet you, I’m Philip Cloud, Suzy’s uncle. I’ve heard about you."

<b>

When I brought Karen over, she looked a bit nervous but gave a polite greeting to my uncle.

In response, my uncle smiled back, and Aunt Liliana and Annie also greeted her with smiles.

I must say, Annie’s smile is worth its weight in gold!

Seeing that made Karen’s expression soften as well. I totally understand that feeling! I know Karen is weak against cute girls, just like I am!!

<b>

"It seems like it’s some kind of fate that the daughter of the former viscount of Munanotosu ended up rooming with Suzy."

<b>

My uncle said that while looking at Karen.

Huh? I thought I had talked about my roommate, but I don’t think I mentioned Karen...

But somehow, my uncle seems to know about Karen? I wonder why?

<b>

"How about it? Since we’ve become acquainted, why don’t you come visit the mansion with Suzy next time?"

<b>

Whoa, my uncle is being sudden! But...

Isn’t that good? Isn’t it nice?

<b>

"Uncle! Is it alright to take Karen with me?"

"Ah, please do invite her. Isn’t that right, Annie?"

"Yes! Of course! Please do come!"

<b>

<b>

"Um... I’m happy about the invitation, but I usually spend my days off with my younger siblings..."

"Uncle, Karen has placed her younger siblings in a facility."

"…A facility? That means... the relatives of Milia’s students are outside...?"

"Uncle?"

<b>

Huh? My uncle suddenly seems deep in thought?

Is there something about the facility where Karen’s siblings are?

Well, it’s true that the facility in question isn’t without its issues...

<b>

"Hmm, if it’s not too rude, may I ask who introduced you to that facility?"

"…Ah, yes, it was introduced by Uncle Nivun..."

"Nivun... Lawrence Nivun. He’s from Grusmil, isn’t he? Hmm."

"Do you know Uncle?"

"Yeah, I do. Mr. Nivun is the head of Grusmil and the representative of the trading group. As the consul general of Amukam, I have some dealings with him."

<b>

Oh, wow... So my uncle actually knows that straightforward horse... ahem, ahem, that second son’s father?

What a surprising connection, or maybe the world is small, or maybe there’s some kind of bond between Karen and me!

While I was thinking that, Vivi whispered from behind, "Since you’re the next head of Amukam, I think you’ll eventually meet him."

Guh?! The other party is the current head. And I’m the next head?!

No, no, no! Vivi saying I’m the next head is just her exaggeration, right?! Right?!

Right?! When I glanced at Vivi, pleading, she looked back at me with a deadpan stare, as if to say, "Get serious already."

<b>

"…Yeah, I’ll try to handle that matter eventually."

<b>

After Karen replied with a slightly surprised expression, "I see," my uncle muttered that and seemed to be deep in thought.

I wonder what my uncle is thinking? Is it something related to the Nivun family? Something like "Don’t bother Karen too much"?

Hmm, but my uncle isn’t the type to meddle in what kids do. It might be something else?

<b>

"Feel free to come visit when you can manage your time."

<b>

In the end, my uncle said that to Karen.

<b>

After that, customers started to trickle in, and after watching us work with satisfaction, my uncles left the shop.

When they were leaving, the owner, Donald, and Alma Maruma came out to see them off.

As expected of my uncle, he knows a lot of people.

<b>

By the way, my uncle also knew Alma.

Should I say, "As expected of the veteran, Sister Alma!"?

<b>

My uncles said they would go shopping and have a meal on Alfalfa Boulevard, and then visit Arvin and the others in the afternoon.

It seems they are also going to greet that "big sister."

I would love to meet that "big sister" someday.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Eventually, the morning passed with just the right amount of busyness, and after we got through the lunchtime hustle, the white wall clock gently ticked into the afternoon.

<b>

Then, as tea time approached, I thought the peak of busyness was coming, and at that moment, a loud voice echoed from one of the tables.

<b>

"That’s why! I’m telling you to call the person in charge!!"

<b>

Oh? Is there some trouble?
