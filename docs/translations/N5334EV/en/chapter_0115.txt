# Chapter 103: Suzy's Intentions

－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－

"The people that Suzu sent out have really settled in well here."

"Really? That's great! In the central region, they tend to be harsh towards anyone who isn't human..."

"Hmph! Those guys are really bad with their central supremacy. As long as the nobles and the Senate exist as they are now... there's nothing we can do."

"…That's true. I just can't forgive them for easily turning people into criminals or slaves over trivial matters..."

"Here, everyone is relaxed. The Grassfoot, who have started to settle in the plains west of Amukam, are helping with the cultivation of various crops, and the elves are coming up with various ideas to disperse the miasma in the forest. Most of the dwarves are holed up in the Ward mines."

"The Ward mines? Were there really veins of ore there that the dwarves would stay holed up?"

"Yeah, apparently the Ward village mines yield rare mithril, gravisten, and even manadium. They've been going at it with their eyes shining as they dig in the mountains."

"Ahaha! That's amazing! It really was the right decision to send them out."

"Yeah, the minerals we get are sent to the blacksmithing area in Corptown, where they make equipment for us."

"Oh, could this be strengthening the village's fighting power?"

"Absolutely! The magical efficiency of the equipment is completely different! Apparently, the magical properties of the ores mined in Amukam are on a whole different level compared to those from other places!"

"Really?! I had no idea!"

"Right now, even the magical beasts in the shallow layers are no problem for the adults in the village."

"Wow! That's incredible!"

"We're also able to obtain a lot more materials from magical beasts than before. The performance of the equipment made with those materials can be improved much more efficiently than before."

"Indeed, the skills of the dwarves are amazing."

"Well, that might be more due to the techniques of the elves and half-elves. Their ability to imbue special effects onto magical beast materials is impressive."

"I see! Since they're natural materials, it makes sense that it would be the elves."

"That seems to be the case. Combined with the traditional material processing techniques that have existed in Amukam for a long time, it's really become something amazing."

"Oh, now I'm curious about what exactly that something amazing is."

"Right now, I'm having Suzu's exclusive equipment, 'Hero's Exclusive Equipment,' made! Once you wear it, you'll definitely understand."

"Wait, wait! Can you please stop calling me 'Hero'...?"

"Since the half-elves have started a business selling processed materials in Corptown, they've also set up a trading company to distribute it."

"Corptown? The little settlement that was used as a waiting area for carriages?"

"That's right. It's becoming a fine little town, even if it's still small."

"Wow, I'm learning so much today... So, is that trading company going to run smoothly?"

"…The distribution in Karais is controlled by the Alconnen Marquis family."

"Yeah, that makes sense... as expected."

"But now... with the dwarves' help, we can build powerful ships. If we do that, we can cooperate with Oceanos and open new trade routes."

"Huh? Do the dwarves also have shipbuilding skills?"

"No, shipbuilding is Oceanos' expertise. We're providing them with strong materials."

"I see! The wood from the Amukam forest, right? To make a large ship's hull, we need to cut down trees from deeper inside... where the stronger magical beasts are. But with our current fighting power..."

"The wood cut from the Amukam forest is sturdier than flimsy iron plates. We also have the technology to process that wood."

"I see what you're getting at, Thor. You plan to use that to create maritime trade routes, right?"

"Exactly! And then I'll turn the tables on those who are sitting pretty! I won't let Amukam continue to be a meal for Alconnen and the central region!"

"…Thor, please don't do anything reckless, okay? Those people won't just sit back and watch."

"Don't worry, Suzu, I won't do anything reckless. By the time they notice, I'll already have a knife at their throats! So... I'll proceed carefully."

"Thor! I'm telling you I don't want you to do anything dangerous! Do you understand?!!"

"I'm fine, I'm fine! Don't be angry, Suzu! Really, I won't do anything reckless! I promise, Suzu!"

"Really? You really mean it? You absolutely can't do anything dangerous, okay?"

"I won't, I won't! I promise I won't do anything dangerous. I really won't."

"You're serious, right? It's a promise, okay? I don't want you to do anything dangerous, okay? It's a promise!"

"Yeah, I understand. I promise. I won't do anything, so don't be angry, Suzu."

"…Okay, if you understand, Thor..."

"That's right! Once the ship is ready and the trade route is operational, I'll come to deliver Suzu's equipment!"

"Huh?!"

"It'll take a long way around the continent by sea, but I will definitely come!"

"Is that really possible?!"

"Absolutely! I will definitely reach you within a year!"

"…A year."

"Wait for me, Suzu! This time, I will definitely see you again!"

"This time... really? Really?!!"

"Yes! I promise!"

"…A promise?"

"I'll prove that I will keep my promise to you! So wait for a year, Suzu!"

"…………Okay. I'll wait, I'll wait for you, Thor! You must come!"

"Yeah, it's a promise!"

"……Yeah, a promise… Thor."

<b>

Since this week began, we who turned 14 in the village and had acquired our 'initial class' have been able to level up to what is called a 'basic job' after enrolling in the academy and having our spiritual seals inscribed.

As planned, I became a 'Bard' from 'Diviner.'

<b>

Everyone from Amukam has also completed their class upgrades to their respective higher classes.

<b>

"Now, there's no problem if we become D-rank at any time."

<b>

As I looked around at us who had completed our class upgrades, Colin quietly nodded and said that.

Vivi was puffing up her chest and declaring, "There's nothing to worry about!" but...

D-rank refers to the adventurer guild's rank, right? I wonder if there's any relation between leveling up our 'jobs' and the guild's rank? I don't really understand.

<b>

Also, the 'Novice' that Lady Cordelia mentioned refers to the stage before becoming an initial class.

Vivi said that she received Algernon from her father when she was little. It's only natural that she's still before novice.

And Beatrice has no intention of becoming a tamer at all.

<b>

The summoner class can be advanced from 'Bard' or 'Magician,' or by choosing 'Tamer,' which branches from 'Ranger.' Vivi has publicly declared that she aims to become a 'Soul Lord,' the highest class of her healing job, just like her father, Sir Silence. So she has no intention of progressing into the summoner class.

<b>

I wonder what Lady Cordelia will do for her basic job?

The 'Beastmaster' she aims for is a direct master class from 'Tamer,' so normally, it would be logical to first aim for 'Ranger.'

But, to be honest, she doesn't seem very good at physical activities. So I wonder if she'll enter from the magical classes instead?

<b>

Starting next week, elective classes that match the 'jobs' we hope for will begin, so we might end up in the same class after all.

Well, if that happens, it could be fun!

<b>

Oh, by the way, it's said that becoming a 'basic job' this early after enrollment is something only those from Amukam can do!

Most kids are considered fast if they become 'Novice' upon enrollment.

Originally, students are supposed to carefully assess their suitability after entering the academy and explore the path that suits them best.

The first year is essentially for that purpose, as Ms. Ursula also said.

It's certainly the path I should take! I want them to think carefully and come up with an answer!

<b>

But then again, if you take it easy in Amukam, you won't survive.

First of all, all the children in Amukam are eagerly waiting for the day they can receive their tags and become part of the civil protection group as 1st class!

Children from towns who have never seen magical beasts and children from villages where the threat of magical beasts is constant cannot share the same values.

This discrepancy is probably unavoidable.

<b>

<b>

Speaking of which, Karen said she still hasn't become a novice.

She mentioned that she has aptitude for two attributes and intends to pursue a magical job, but Karen seems more suited for physical activities...

Well, these things are ultimately up to the individual, so I can only offer advice at best. But I hope Karen makes a choice she won't regret.

<b>

Speaking of Karen, after returning to the dorm, I asked her a little about Lady Ruri, but it seems she doesn't want to talk about it much, and she became very tight-lipped. I realized I shouldn't pry into it.

Even so, I could sense Karen's feelings of not wanting to face Lady Ruri, so at least in places where I can see, like the dining hall or dormitory, I plan to keep a solid guard!

However, since we are in different classes, I wanted to ask Lady Cordelia for help... But it seems she's still concerned about the previous incident, and when I try to approach her to talk, she and her friends avoid me as if fleeing.

<b>

I don't mind, though.

<b>

Oh, of course, the small animals are a different story! I'm very concerned about them!!

Since that incident, they have been running away in the forest within the academy grounds, not responding to their master's calls.

Algernon, I will definitely catch you and hand you over to Vivi!!

<b>

Since things are like this, I plan to ask Lady Cordelia indirectly.

I'll ask that tall attendant who looked pale, to have Anna Marie deliver some herbal tea.

If she can convey the message card I wrote, stating that I don't mind and asking about Karen, that would be great...

Of course, the best way would be to ask Karen directly, but for now, she won't meet my eyes.

So, I plan to ask Anna Marie to be my messenger.

<b>

But Anna Marie has been busy lately, not only with dormitory work but also helping with the academy's administrative tasks, so she seems quite busy.

But if I don't ask her to run this personal errand of mine, she might get angry and say something like, "Taking care of the young lady is my true job, so why wasn't I called?!" 

Well, maybe she can deliver it during her free time?

<b>

First, I need to build a wall to guard Karen from Lady Ruri and the Niven family's son.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Hey! You! What do you think you're doing?!!"

<b>

"?"

<b>

Amidst these thoughts, I felt that our school life was starting to get on track during the lunch break in the middle of the week.

At one end of the large table where we were eating, one of the Niven family members was raising his voice.

<b>

Looking over there, I saw that the aforementioned Niven family member was grabbing the collar of Arvin's shirt, who was about to shovel in a large bowl of beef bowl with plenty of sauce.

Arvin, on the other hand, was deliberately letting out an exaggerated sigh without even making eye contact with him.

Naturally, the other guy's forehead was already bulging with veins.

<b>

Hey, Arvin, what did you do this time?

Thank you for always reading!
