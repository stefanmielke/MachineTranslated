The people Tin sent out, they're doing well and taking root here.

Really? That's good. In the center, it's hard to hit non-humans, so ......"

They're very centrist! They have a terrible central supremacy. If the nobles and the senate remain as they are, there's nothing we can do about it as long as ...... they exist."

I think it's ...... right. I can't forgive them for trying to make us into criminals and slaves over things that don't matter. ......

We're all very excited to be here," he says. The grasshoppers, who have begun to make their home on the plains west of Amkham, are helping to grow various crops, and the elves are devising ways to dissipate the miasma in the forest. The dwarves are mostly holed up in the mines of the woad.

The mines of Woad? There was a vein of ore there that the dwarves were holed up in?"

The mines in the village of Woerd are said to be able to extract rare mithril, gravistein, and even manadium, and they are holed up in the mountains with their eyes wide open.

Haha! That's great! I knew I was right to send you out."

Yes, we send the minerals we get to Copetown, where we built a blacksmith shop, and they make equipment for us.

"Wow. Is this helping to strengthen the village by any chance?"

'Oh! The magical efficiency of the equipment is totally different! I heard that the ore from Amkham has a different magic than the ore from other places in the world!

Heh heh heh! I had no idea! I had no idea!"

Right now, the adults in the village can handle shallow demonic beasts with no trouble.

Oh, that's great!" That's awesome!"

The materials for the monsters are now more plentiful than ever before. "We can now get more materials from magical beasts, and we can use them to improve the performance of our equipment more efficiently.

I knew it, the dwarves have great skills.

No, I think it's the technology of the elves and half-elves in that area. They have great technology to give special effects to magical beast materials.

I see! Only natural materials, after all, are there elves there..."

I guess so. Combined with the material processing techniques that have been around in AMCAM for a long time, now it's going to be great."

"Ho-ho-ho, I'm kind of curious to see what's going on."

I'm having Tin's special equipment, the "Yusha-sama's special equipment," made! I'm having a special equipment made for Tin! You'll understand when you wear it.

"Hey, hey, I need you to stop calling me 'Mr. Brave'. ......"

The half-elves have started a business in Copetown selling their processed goods, and we've set up a trading company to distribute them.

"Copetown? You know, that little hamlet that used to wait for horse-drawn carriages?"

Yes, it is. Now we're becoming a small but respectable town."

'Wow, I'm kind of impressed with all the things I'm seeing today. ...... So, is that business association going to run well?"

...... because the Marquises of Alconnen control the distribution of the province of Carise in the middle."

Yes, that's right. ...... I knew it."

But now ......, with the help of the dwarves, we can build a powerful ship. Then, in cooperation with Oceanus, we can open up new routes.

What? Dwarves have shipbuilding skills too?"

No, shipbuilding is Oceano's technology. From here, we provide the powerful materials."

'I see! That's the wood from the Amkam forest, right? To make a big hull, we need to cut down the trees in the back ......, where there are strong magical beasts. But with our current strength, we can ......"

Wood cut from the forests of Amkamu is stronger than poor steel plates. We have the technology to cut and process that wood.

I'm beginning to see your point, Thor. You're going to use that to create a route for marine commerce and industry, aren't you?"

Yes, I will! I'm going to turn over the feet of those who are sitting on their dodgy feet! I will not let Amkham continue to be a prey for Alconnen and the center!"

"...... Mr. Thor. Please don't do anything rash? There is no way those people would stand by and watch you do that."

It's all right, Tin, I never do anything rash. When they find out, I already have the tip of the knife at their throats, or else! So ......, proceed with caution."

Thor, I don't want you to do anything dangerous! I'm telling you I don't want you to do anything dangerous! Do you understand?

'It's all right, it's all right! Don't get angry, Tin! It's okay, I won't do anything reckless! I won't do anything dangerous! I'm telling you the truth, Tin!

Really? Really? You really don't want me to do anything dangerous, do you?"

'I don't, I won't, so I won't do anything dangerous.' I really don't."

I promise, okay? I promise, okay? I don't want you to do anything dangerous. Promise?"

'Un, okay, I promise. I won't, so don't get mad at me again, Tin."

"...... Yeah, Thor, if you understand ......"

I'll deliver Tin's equipment when the boat is ready and the shipping lanes are open! When the ship is built and the shipping lanes are available, I'll deliver Tin's equipment!"

What?

We'll have to use the ocean to go around the continent, but we'll be there!"

Oh, no, you can't do that!

'Oh! I'll get to you in a year, I promise!"

"......1 year."

Wait for me, Tin, I'll see you this time!"

'This time, ......, really? Really?

Oh," he said! I promise! You have my word!"

"...... promise?"

I'll prove to you that I will keep my promise to you! So wait a year, Tin!"

"............ Okay, I'll wait. I'll wait, I'll wait for you, Thor! Be sure to come!"

Oh, I promise!"

"...... yeah, promise ...... Thor you."

After this week, we, who had acquired the "initial class" of "jobs" when we turned 14 years old in the village, were able to move up in class to what is known as "basic jobs" after entering the academy and having our spiritual seals engraved.

I went from being a "soothsayer" to a "bard" as originally planned.

<blank>

Everyone in AMCAM has also completed their own class upgrade to a class above their own.

<blank>

Now it doesn't matter when I get a D."

<blank>

Colin nodded quietly as he looked around at us after we had finished our class-up.

Bibi said, "I'm not going to miss a thing!" she said, puffing out her chest. ......

D rank means rank in the adventurers' union, right? What does raising the class of a "job" have to do with raising the rank of the union? I'm not sure.

<blank>

And when Miss Cordilia said 'Novice', she was referring to the stage before the initial class.

Bibi said that Algernon was given to him by his father when he was a little boy. It's no wonder it's pre-Novice.

And yet, Beatrice has no intention of becoming a tamer.

<blank>

The follower system is from "Summoner" proceeding from "Bard" or "Magician".

I can become a "tamer," which is a derivative of "ranger," or I can become a "tamer," which is a derivative of "ranger. Bibi has publicly stated that he is aiming to become a "Soul Lord," the highest level of the "Poet," the recovery profession he has advanced to this time, the same as his father, Silence-san. She has no intention of going on to become a follower.

<blank>

What would Miss Cordelia do for a basic job?

The "Phantom Beastmaster" that you say you are aiming for is a direct master job from "tamer," so the normal way to go about it is to become a "ranger" first.

But, sorry to say, she doesn't look like she's very good at being physically active. So I guess I'd have to start with the magic profession after all?

<blank>

Next week, I'm also starting an elective class that fits the 'job' I want, and surprisingly, she and I may be together there.

Well, that would be fun, wouldn't it?

<blank>

Oh, and by the way, the only people who get "basic jobs" at this early stage of enrollment are those from AMCAM!

Most children are quicker if they are 'Novice' when they enter school.

Normally, after entering the school, students would take their time to determine their aptitude and seek the most suitable path for themselves.

Dr. Ursula said that this is what the first year is all about.

It is certainly the path you should take! I hope you will think about it carefully and come up with an answer!

<blank>

Well, having said that, you can't live in Amcam if you are that laid-back.

All of the 1st Amcam kids are eagerly awaiting the day when they will be placed in the "initial class" as soon as they get their tag and become part of the Protectorate as 1sts!

There is no way that children in a town who have never seen a magical beast and children in a village where there is a constant threat of magical beasts have the same values.

This discrepancy may be unavoidable, after all.

<blank>

<blank>

Karen also said that, come to think of it, you haven't become a Novice yet.

She said she was going to go into magic because she has an aptitude for both attributes, but Karen seems more suited to physical work. ......

Well, I can only offer advice, since these things are for you to decide for yourself. But I hope that Karen will make a choice that she has no regrets about.

<blank>

Speaking of Karen, after returning to the dormitory, I asked her a little about what had happened with Miss Lurie, but she didn't seem to want to talk about it much and became very heavy-mouthed. I felt again that I shouldn't force her to talk about it.

Even so, I was able to read Karen's desire not to face Miss Lurie, so at least in the cafeteria and in the dormitory, where I could see her, I was going to wear a tight blindfold to guard her!

However, since we are in different classes on campus, I was hoping to ask Miss Cordelia, who is in the same class with me, to help me out. ...... The first time I went to the school, I saw the girls in the same class as me, and I thought, "I'm going to ask them to go to the same class as me.

<blank>

I don't mind it.

<blank>

Oh, except for the little animals, of course! I care enough about them!

Since that time, they have been running around in the woods on the school grounds, not answering their master's calls.

Damn you Algernon, I'll be sure to catch you and hand you over to Bibi!

<blank>

I'm going to ask Miss Cordilia to do this indirectly, since that's not how it works.

That big, pale, tall one with the attendant, that girl, I would ask AnnaMarie to deliver herbal tea to her.

I am thinking of ...... if I could have Miss Cordilia tell her with herbal tea and a message card stating that I don't mind and that I am asking her to take care of Karen.

Of course, it would be best to ask for Karen in person, but so far she hasn't been able to meet me face to face!

That is why I am asking AnnaMary to be the messenger instead of me.

<blank>

However, AnnaMarie has been busy not only with dormitory work but also with administrative work at the school, which seems surprisingly busy.

But if I didn't ask her to run a personal errand for me, she would probably say, "Since taking care of your daughter is what I am supposed to do, why don't you ask me? I'm sure they would get angry with me.

Well, why don't you just have it delivered a little bit at a time when you're free?

<blank>

The first thing we need to do is to build a wall to guard Karen from Miss Lurie and the late son of the Niven family.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Hey! What the hell are you doing? What the hell are you doing?

<blank>

?"

<blank>

It was a mid-week lunch break when I was thinking that my school life was starting to take off.

At the end of the large table where we were eating, a group of people were shouting.

<blank>

When I looked over there, I saw a member of the Niven family grabbing Irving by the collar of his shirt as he was just about to wolf down a large bowl of beef with soup and egg on it.

Speaking of Irving, he doesn't make eye contact with this guy and lets out a big, deliberate sigh.

As a matter of course, the other party's forehead was covered with blue streaks! and a blue streak appears on his forehead.

<blank>

Hey Irving, what the hell did you do this time?
