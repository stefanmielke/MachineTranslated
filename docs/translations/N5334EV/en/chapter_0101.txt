# Episode 89: A Chat on Exam Day

Chronologically, this is a story about the exam day, about 4 to 5 months before enrollment.

----------------

<b>

At the entrance exam for Miria Castle Eye, candidates are tested not only on academics but also on physical strength and magical power.

Last year, it was a good memory (?), when Dana couldn't show her magical power and Colin was in a panic.

<b>

The physical test was something like measuring basic physical strength.

What we did were time trials for long and short-distance running, and a match format sparring.

<b>

The long-distance run measured the time taken to complete a distance of 5 kilometers, and I just followed Mia closely, finishing right after her at the goal.

The short-distance run was a 50-meter dash time measurement.

I finished just a step behind the other kids running with me. The kid I ran with was fairly fast, so I think my time wasn't that bad.

<b>

The sparring was conducted in a one-round (3 minutes) match format, and the opponents were the junior knights who had come from the knight training school.

<b>

Normally, standing for even 30 seconds would be enough to pass, but all the muscle-bound Amukamu folks managed to win.

Even though we were facing junior knights, is this really okay?

Well, it was only natural that Irvin and Lombard finished them off quickly since we were giving off a "give it your all" aura from behind!

Amukamu men are not allowed to hold back, you know?

But how is it that even Bibi and Mia ended up winning? The junior knights looked like they were about to cry!

<b>

Well, I was told not to stand out, so I tried to endure for the full 3 minutes!

But just before the 3 minutes were up, Bibi, who was watching my sparring, clenched her fist as if to say "yes!" so I returned the gesture, and it seemed that my wooden sword hit the opponent in a good spot, and before I knew it, the junior knight was rolling on the ground.

The junior knight, who was knocked down, looked surprised with wide-open eyes, but I was surprised too! But since I used up all my time, I thought it was fine!

Well, it's not a problem, right? It's safe, right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

The morning ended with just the physical test, and until the afternoon magic test began, it was lunchtime.

For lunch, we were told we could eat wherever we liked, whether in the classroom, the auditorium where we had the sparring, or the schoolyard. The weather was nice, so I had Anna Mary spread a cross on the sunny grass at the edge of the schoolyard to prepare lunch.

There, I spread out the contents of a large basket that Aunt Liliana had given me for lunch. It was packed full of various types of sandwiches.

The roast beef sandwich had layers of soft and juicy roast beef and lettuce, and its cross-section looked just like a roast beef mille-feuille!

The sandwich made with this baguette was overflowing with sliced, heavily seasoned smoked beef and plenty of camembert cheese, definitely hearty!

The egg sandwich had boiled eggs spilling out, and the yolks shone like jewels!

These were all homemade by Aunt Liliana, who is a great cook. They were all bound to be delicious!

The two boys immediately started devouring the lined-up sandwiches as soon as they sat down.

<b>

As expected, Irvin, who was eating in a hurry, began to choke on a sandwich.

Bibi rubbed his back and offered him a cup of soup, asking, "Why are you in such a rush?"

As Irvin said, "Sorry," while reaching for the soup cup, their hands touched, and both of them blushed in surprise...

What is this, a picture-perfect moment?

<b>

"Ah! Irvin, you've got sauce on the side of your mouth again!"

"Huh? I-it's fine! Just get it yourself... ah!"

"Geez! You should eat more calmly... Here! Got it! ...Hmm."

"Ah, y-you idiot! Why are you licking the sauce off your finger?!"

"Huh?! Ah! ...Sorry... uh..."

"…No… uh..."

"「「「…………」」」"

<b>

Next to their little world, Lombard, who had turned into air, was silently chewing on a chicken sandwich.

Mia and I quietly bit into our egg sandwiches, watching their romantic comedy with eyes devoid of highlights.

What is with this couple... Just get married already!

<b>

Well, putting the silly couple aside, I looked around again and realized there were quite a few examinees. It felt like there were nearly 100 people just at a glance.

The exam is conducted over two days.

The written exam and interviews were held the day before. Today, the second day, is for the physical and magical tests, but because of the large number of candidates, Anna Mary told me it would be divided into three sessions.

In other words, the total number of examinees is three times the number of people currently here. About 300 people? But I heard that only about 50 people pass, right?

Huh? Isn't this quite a high competition rate?

Since all the seniors from Amukamu passed, I had been thinking more casually about it... but isn't this place not just for anyone to pass? Is Miria Castle Eye actually a pretty elite school? Huh...?

I realized there was a discrepancy in my understanding, and I felt a trickle of sweat running down my back during lunch.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The afternoon magical test involved confirming the aptitude attributes using the five spirit plates, measuring magical power, and then conducting a test for activating spirit magic.

<b>

The five spirit plates used in the entrance exam were much more elaborate than those at the village school.

In front of the stone tablet where you place your hands, there are five pipes about a meter long, seemingly made of crystal.

When magical power is channeled into the stone tablet, the pipes respond according to their respective attributes, and light rises from them.

Additionally, the pipes are marked with scales that react to the light of the magical power that rises, allowing for the measurement of the magical power in numerical form after a set time of channeling.

Receiving an explanation about the device that raises the scales when magical power is channeled, I was reminded of a lung capacity test I did long ago. But since it’s not about expelling all my magical power, it might be a bit different.

<b>

Normally, it is said that the total of these scales should reach 10 to 20 to pass. For examinees, it is said that a high score would be around 50 to 60.

However, Bibi showed an extraordinary performance by lighting up the magical power in all five attribute pipes, with a total exceeding 200.

Furthermore, Mia also lit up the four attributes except for "Void," surpassing Bibi with a total exceeding 250, which is also an extraordinary number.

Thanks to the two of them, the exam venue became quite chaotic.

Isn't it annoying when people can't hold back!

On the other hand, I managed to successfully control my magical power, which I had restrained as much as possible, and although I got reactions from all five attributes, my total score was a very ordinary 50! Yes! This is the result of my daily control training, right?!!

<b>

<b>

The magic activation test that followed was a place similar to the magic training ground at the village school.

In other words, it was a spacious area with a "target" placed at a distance, surrounded by sturdy stone walls, like an archery range or shooting range.

<b>

Here, successfully activating the spirit magic that one can use is the passing standard for the test.

Huh? Success in activation?

Everyone in the village uses it normally, right? I often saw magic misfiring (I did it too!), but did anyone ever fail to activate it?

Thinking this while tilting my head and watching the test, I noticed that there were indeed some kids who were failing.

Hmm... Is this the norm?

At this moment, I began to feel a slight doubt about the difference in common sense between Amukamu and the outside world.

<b>

<b>

There were up to three attempts allowed, and the number of tries was also limited. Is this like a track and field event?!

<b>

There was a child who aimed at the target and shot water.

A little stream of water arced and fell about a meter ahead. Is this water art?!! But the child who finished looked somewhat satisfied.

I think Mia's "Water Cutter" would slice through that target easily at this distance!

<b>

There was a child who swung a baton and shot a fireball.

A small fireball, about the size of a match head, flew and hit the target, bursting and disappearing. The child looked quite proud.

I think Carl's "Fire Bread" would smash that target and create a big hole in the earthen wall behind it, big enough for an orc to fit through!

<b>

All the kids who activated their magic were happily congratulating each other, saying they did well! Good job! That's enough! ...Is this... huh? Is this really normal? Is everyone from Amukamu strange? Is this the truth of the world? Huh? My common sense wasn't common at all?! My head was spinning.

<b>

While I was lost in thought, Bibi stepped forward. As usual, she confidently placed her hands on her hips, grinning with one corner of her mouth raised, standing proudly in the middle of the testing ground.

<b>

Bibi squatted down on the spot, placed her hands on the ground, and activated her spirit magic.

《Stone Wall》

Boom! Bang! Rumble!! A thick stone wall rose up, spreading out like a fan from Bibi.

The walls standing about ten meters away from Bibi were greatly deforming the ground of the testing area.

The venue was in an uproar. The exam supervisor was gaping.

...Ah, I recognize that gaping expression. I often made Bibi and Colin make that face...

Now it's a good memory... heh.

<b>

While I was lost in those memories, Bibi looked at the supervisor as if to ask if that was good. The supervisor nodded vigorously several times.

Seeing that, Bibi, looking satisfied, placed her hands back on the ground, and the wall that had risen sank back down, quickly returning the ground to its flat state. The venue was once again in an uproar.

With a sense of accomplishment, Bibi flicked her hair over her shoulder and left the testing ground with a brisk stride.

That was incredibly flashy! Does the word "self-restraint" even exist in her dictionary?! Yes!

<b>

Then, as if to replace Bibi, Mia entered the venue.

Mia had her finger on her mouth, looking a bit thoughtful, but soon clapped her hands as if she had an idea and activated her spirit magic.

《Restraining Thorn》

Immediately, the ground at the target's feet cracked, and thorns began to rise up from there.

The targets in the testing area were made of logs, a type known as "wooden men." They were simple structures with no limbs, just a thick torso topped with a small log resembling a head. About five of them stood at equal intervals.

The thorns Mia summoned rose up from the feet of all five targets, completely enveloping them.

The sound of the logs creaking and cracking as they were squeezed by the thorns echoed throughout the testing area.

The sight of the thorns extending like tentacles and constricting the wooden men was quite gruesome, I thought.

Many of the onlookers were grimacing, and some even swallowed hard.

But the one who did it was innocently delighted to receive a passing mark from the supervisor. Naturally, the venue was once again in an uproar...

This is bad, isn't it? Amukamu quality...

<b>

Next was my turn. After Mia, I stood in the center of the testing ground.

Since I was following two flashy performances, I thought I wouldn't stand out too much with just a little something.

That said, I had no intention of doing anything flashy!

I planned to do something inconspicuous and plain.

《Air Block》

This is a magic that collects air in a designated location to create a compressed mass of air, which looks like nothing is happening.

It's similar to creating an air cushion under your butt when skiing on grass.

To the onlookers, it might not be clear what I was doing, but the supervisor would definitely see that the magic was activated, so there was no problem!

<b>

"Spirit magic" is about ordering spirits to perform magic by providing your own magical power, which allows the spirits to manifest the magic in return. The scale and power of the manifested magic depend on the size and quality of the provided magical power.

Expanding the magical range and thinning the density... or perhaps making the magical range smaller and increasing the density...

Such adjustments of magical power make this magic easy to visualize, and it is often used in magical control training.

So, I thought it would be sufficient to create a mass of air about the size of a tennis ball with this basic magic if all I had to do was activate it.

<b>

...I thought so! But why is so much wind gathering?! I had no intention of compressing the air more than necessary! It feels like the air is gathering with great force! Is the spirit working too hard?!!

I might have slightly focused on compressing the air, but... I should have restrained my magical power enough?! But the air gathering... the wind blowing towards my hands is overwhelming!! Is this bad?! The compressed air won't generate heat and become plasma, right?! I'm not thinking "compression! compression!" or anything like that, okay?! Bibi and Mia are looking at me with "she messed up!" expressions! Damn it—!

If I continue like this, it feels like something really bad is going to happen, so I decided to cancel the activation of the magic!

For now, the supervisor should have confirmed the activation of "spirit magic," so it should be fine... yes! It's fine!!

<b>

So I canceled the magic there...

<b>

Normally, after completing the magic, the gathered mass of air would be dispersed softly around or released like deflating a balloon. But what happens when the state is suddenly released while converging...

The mass of air that had gathered from all over the testing area. If the inward pulling force suddenly disappears, the force will inevitably move outward. Moreover, it was released after being sufficiently compressed. The air was released at supersonic speed.

A massive explosion.

It made a tremendous sound as it burst.

I imagine it would feel like a huge balloon that had been inflated to its limit, about 10 meters in diameter, bursting all at once.

That massive explosion happened right in my palm.

The supervisor, who was nearby, was blown away by the wind pressure and rolled away, and those who had been watching outside the testing area were also blown back by the wind pressure, causing quite a commotion. Thankfully, no one was injured. ...I'm really glad. As long as no one is hurt, it's safe, right?

The test was also cleared with the confirmation of "the activation of magic!" All in all, it was safe, safe!!

<b>

Just as I was feeling happy about that, Bibi and Mia came over. They rushed over to share in this joy, and as I smiled and hurried towards them, Bibi firmly grabbed my shoulder.

<b>

"What were you doing when you were told not to stand out?! We were doing flashy things instead, so it became meaningless! You should have shown some restraint!!"

<b>

She whispered in a low voice, bringing her face close! Mia nodded in agreement!

Huh?! Why?! I was safe, right?! Yet I'm being told to show restraint by someone who didn't?!

<b>

When I muttered that, Bibi, who caught it with her keen ears, glared at me fiercely, saying it was "out, out!"... sob, sob, sob.

<b>

Thank you for always reading!
