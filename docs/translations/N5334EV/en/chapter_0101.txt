# 89 - Examination Day Quiet Talk

Chronologically, this was on the day of the exam, about 4-5 months before admission.

The entrance examination at Milia Castel Eye tests physical magic as well as classroom learning.

I have a good memory (?) of Colin's impatience last year when Dana couldn't produce the magic value. I'm sure it was a good memory (?).

<blank>

The physical fitness test was like a test of basic physical fitness.

What we did was to time the long and short distance runs and to stand match style.

<blank>

The long-distance race was a timed five-kilometer run, in which I ran behind Mia and then finished behind her.

The short distance was a timed 50-meter run.

I finished one step behind the girl I was running with. The girl I was running with was fairly fast, so I don't think my time was that bad.

<blank>

The match was a one-round (three-minute) match, and the opponents were semi-knights from a knight's training school.

<blank>

Normally, he said, standing still for 30 seconds is enough to pass the test, but everyone in the brainy Amcam team won.

How is this possible when we are dealing with a quasi-knight?

Well, Irving and Lombardo killed them instantly because we were giving them an "all-out effort" aura from behind as they were talking about how dull the fight was, so it was a foregone conclusion!

No cutting corners with the AmCam guy, okay?

But how was it that Bibi and Mia even won? The semi-knights were in tears, weren't they?

<blank>

Well, I had been told not to stand out, so I decided to stick around for the full three minutes!

But just before the three minutes were up, Bibi, who had been watching me in a standoff, clenched his fist as if to say, "Okay, I'll do it! I clenched my fist, and when I returned it, the wooden sword I was using seemed to have landed in a good spot on my opponent's side, and when I came to, the semi-knight was rolling.

I was also surprised, although the semi-knight who was rolled was wide-eyed with surprise! But I had used up all the time I had, so I thought, "Well, that's OK. I was surprised.

Well, it's all good, right? It's safe, right?

<blank>

The morning session ends with just a physical test, and it's time for lunch before the magic test begins in the afternoon.

We were told that we could take lunch wherever we wanted, in the school classrooms, in the auditorium where we were present, or in the schoolyard. The weather was beautiful, and since it was a good opportunity, I asked AnnaMarie to spread a cross on the sunny grass at the edge of the schoolyard to prepare for lunch.

There, I spread out the contents of a large basket that Aunt Liliana had given me for lunch. It was filled to the brim with sandwiches of all kinds.

The roast beef sandwich is made with layers of tender, juicy roast beef and lettuce, and its cross section looks like a mille-feuille of roast beef!

The sandwich made with this bucket is still very filling, overflowing with sliced spicy smoked beef and tasty Camembert cheese!

The egg sandwich was overflowing with boiled eggs, the yolks shining like jewels!

Aunt Liliana is an excellent cook. All of them must be delicious!

The two boys gobbled up the sandwiches from the moment they sat down, reducing them from one end of the lineup to the other.

<blank>

Sure enough, Irving, in his haste to eat, choked on his sandwich and began to choke.

Bibi patted his back and said, "What are you in such a hurry? and held out a cup of soup.

Irving says, "I'm sorry," and their hands touch each other to accept the cup of soup, and their cheeks are stained with surprise. ......

What is it? What is this picture-perfect flow?

<blank>

Oh! Irving, put sauce on the side of my mouth again!"

What? No, it's okay! Take it yourself. ......, ah!"

Already! You should eat more calmly. ...... Hi! I got it! ......n"

Oh, ba, idiot! Why are you licking the sauce off your fingers?

What?" Ah, ah! ......Gomen ......, hey ......"

"...... no ............ un ......"

""............""

<blank>

Next to the two world-builders, an airborne Lombardo chews silently on a chicken sandwich.

Mia and I watch the romantic comedy with cold eyes that have lost their highlights, and quietly bite into our egg sandwiches.

What a couple ....... Get married already!

<blank>

Well, leaving aside the bakas, I looked around again and noticed once again that there were quite a few examinees. I think there are close to 100 people even at a glance.

The exam will be held on two separate days.

On the previous day, a written test and an interview were held. AnnaMarie told me that today, the second day, was the test on physical and magical strength, and that due to the large number of people taking the test, it was divided into three sessions.

That means the total number of examinees will be three times the number of people here now, or about 300? But I thought you said there would be only 50 or so who would pass the test?

What's that? Isn't this a pretty good ratio?

I thought it was more easy-going because all the older Amcam students had been accepted, but I thought ...... wasn't a place where anyone could get in if they took the entrance exam? Is Milia Castel Eye boarding school actually a very elite school? Oh, no. ......?

It was lunchtime when I realized that there was a gap in my perception and felt sweat dripping down my back.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The afternoon magic test is to check the aptitude attributes and measure the amount of magic using the five spirit boards. The rest is a test to activate spirit magic.

<blank>

The Gosei board used in the entrance examination was much larger than the one used in the village school.

In front of the stone slab to which one's hand is attached, there are five one-meter-long pipes that look like they are made of crystal.

When magic power is poured into the stone slab, the pipes along each attribute react and light rises and falls.

In addition, each pipe has a scale on it that reacts to the light of the rising magic power, so that the amount of magic power can be measured numerically by pouring magic power into the pipe for a specified period of time.

The explanation of the device, which scales up as you pour it in, reminded me somewhat of a lung capacity test I did a long time ago. But I guess it's a little different because it doesn't spit out all the magic power it can.

<blank>

Normally, I was told, a total of 10 to 20 on this scale is enough to pass the test. I was also told that at the level of a student, a number of 50 to 60 is good enough at best.

Bibi, however, launched a magical light into the pipes of all five attributes, totaling more than 200, which was out of the norm.

Mia also launched four other attributes of light besides "nothing," and the total exceeded 250, which was also out of the norm, surpassing Bibi's total.

Thanks to the two of them, the exam room was a riot of its own.

I hate people who can't pull their own weight!

On the other hand, I was able to successfully control the magic power that I had suppressed to the best of my ability, and even though I had reactions to all five attributes, I succeeded in obtaining a total value of about 50, which is a very normal result! Ummm! This is the result of my daily control training, isn't it?

<blank>

<blank>

The testing site for magic activation that followed was also a place similar to the magic forge at the village school.

In short, it is a spacious space with a "target" at a distance and surrounded by a solid stone structure, like an archery range or a shooting range.

<blank>

The criteria for passing the test here is to successfully activate the spirit magic available to you.

Yeah? - Yeah. Successfully triggered?

I always thought everyone in the village used it normally, didn't I? I mean, I've seen magic go off in weird outbursts all the time (and it did!), but... Did it ever fail to activate itself?

As I twisted my head and looked at the test, I realized that there were a few who had failed.

Hmmm... ......, is that how it usually is?

Only now, after all this time, was there the slightest doubt about the difference in common sense between Amcam and the rest of the world.

<blank>

<blank>

The number of attempts was also determined, such as up to three attempts. Is this athletics?

<blank>

Some children pointed their tact at the target and let the water fly.

 Was it a water trick? But the kid who finished it looked satisfied.

I think Mia's "water cutter" would tear through that target at this distance like a scone, don't you?

<blank>

There was a child waving a tact and sending fireballs flying.

A small fireball, about the size of the tip of a ...... match, flew out and hit the target, bounced off and disappeared. The kid who did it was very proud of himself.

I think Carl's shot of "Fire Bread" would shatter that target and drill a hole in the mud wall behind it big enough to hold a whole orc.

<blank>

All the kids who invoked the magic did well! Well done! Enough is enough! And they are happy with each other. ............ Is this ......are? Is this normal? Is everyone in AMCAM crazy? Is this the truth of the world? Are you? My common sense is not common sense? My head is spinning in circles.

<blank>

In the meantime, Bibi came forward. As usual, he stood confidently with his hands on his hips and the corner of his mouth turned up in a grin, standing in the middle of the shooting range.

<blank>

Bibi squatted down on the spot and put his hand on the earth to activate the spirit magic.

《Stone Wall》

Dong! Dogon! Gogogong! and a thick wall of stone rises up, fanning out around Bibi.

The wall, which stood about 10 meters away from Bibi, had deformed the ground of the test site considerably.

The place was in an uproar. The exam supervisor had a big mouth.

...... Oh, that picture face with the big mouth open looks familiar. I used to make Bibi and Colin look like that. ......

Now that's a good memory. ...... Phew.

<blank>

While I was immersed in these memories, Bibi was looking at that supervisor to say, "Is this okay? He looked at that supervisor as if to say, "Is this okay? The supervisor nodded broadly and repeatedly.

Bibi, seeing this, put his hand on the ground again with a look of satisfaction, and the wall that had been standing up sank into the ground, suddenly changing to flat ground as if nothing had happened. Once again, the place was abuzz.

Bibi was full of energy, and she was so full of accomplishment that she just brushed her hair off her shoulders and walked briskly out of the examination room! and brushed her hair off her shoulders, and left the testing site with a dashing gait.

She was so fancy! I wonder if she doesn't have the two words 'dead weight' in her dictionary? Ummm..!

<blank>

Then, Mia entered the place to replace Bibi.

Mia put her finger to her mouth a little thoughtfully, but then she immediately thought of something! She clapped her hands as if to say, "I've got an idea!

《Restling Thorn》.

Immediately, the foot of the target cracked and thorns grew up from it.

The target placed at the test site is made of logs and is what is called a "wooden man. It is a simple object with a thick body without parts that resemble arms and legs, on top of which is a small log that resembles a head. There are about five of them standing side by side at equal intervals.

The thorns that Mia produced grew up from the feet of all five of them and swallowed the entire target cleanly.

The creaking and crackling of the logs echoed through the testing area as they were wrapped and constricted by the thorns.

I think it is a very gruesome picture of thorns growing up like tentacles and clamping down on a tree man.

A number of people watching around me were twitching and scrunching their faces. Some of them even gulped and swallowed raw saliva.

But the person who did it is innocently happy that the supervisor gave him a pass. Naturally, the place is in an uproar here, too. ......

Yuck, huh? Amcam quality: .......

<blank>

After Mia, it was my turn. I stood in the center of the testing room in place of Mia.

After the two flashy performances, a few things wouldn't stand out.

That said, I have no intention of doing anything flashy either!

I'm going to have to play the low-profile, unassuming guy here.

《Air block》.

This is a simple magic that gathers air at an arbitrary location and creates a mass of compressed air, which looks like it does not know what it is doing.

The air cushion under the buttocks when lawn skiing is a kind of application of this.

To the casual observer, they won't know what they're doing, but to the supervisor, they'll know the magic is in effect, so no problem!

<blank>

The "spirit magic" is a kind of magic in which you order a spirit to perform magic for you, and by offering your own magic power, the spirit will perform the magic for you. The scale and power of the magic will vary depending on the size and quality of the magical power offered.

Do you want to increase the magic range and decrease the density ......? Or, a smaller magic range and more density. ......

It is one of the most common magic used in magic control training, as it is easy to visualize the adjustment of such magic.

So I thought that if I just needed to activate the magic, this basic magic would be enough to create a mass of air about the size of a tennis ball.

<blank>

I was thinking ......! Why is the wind coming together so much? I didn't mean to compress the air any more than necessary at all! I feel like the air is coming together at an alarming rate! What's with the genie?

The air is a little bit more solid, but I'm sure I've controlled the magic enough,......! But the wind that blows the gathered air ...... to my hand is not half as strong as it should be! Is this bad? The compressed air doesn't heat up and create plasma, does it? I'm going to compress! I'm not thinking, "Oh, compressed air! I don't think so, do you? Bibi and Mia are looking at me like, "Oh shit! Bibi and Mia are looking at me with eyes that say, "You got me! Damn!

I had a feeling that it would be very bad if I continued, so I decided to cancel the activation of the magic!

At any rate, the supervisor should have confirmed the activation of the "spirit magic", so there should be no problem. ......, ungh! No problem!

<blank>

So I cancelled the magic there. ......

<blank>

Normally, after completing the magic, the gathered air mass would be softly dispersed into the surroundings or released outward like a balloon being deflated. But what happens to a mass of air that is suddenly released during convergence? ......

It is a mass of air that has gathered from the entire test site as if the wind were blowing all around it. If the force that attracts it inward suddenly disappears, the force will inevitably move outward. Moreover, the air was compressed more than enough and then released. The air was released beyond the speed of sound.

It's a huge explosion.

It burst with a great noise.

If a huge balloon, inflated to about 10 meters in diameter with air pushed to its limit, were to burst all at once, it would look something like this, wouldn't it?

It was such a big explosion that happened right in my hands.

The supervisor who was watching nearby was blown away by the wind pressure and rolled away, and the people who were looking at the situation outside the test center were also nearly blown off their feet by the wind pressure. Still, no one was hurt, so that's good. ......I'm really glad. No one was hurt, so it's safe, right?

The test was also clear as well, as "magic activation was confirmed"! At any rate, overall, it's safe, safe!

<blank>

While I was rejoicing, Bibi and Mia came close to me. I rushed to their side with a smile to share this joy with them, but Bibi caught me with her shoulders clenched tightly.

<blank>

What are you doing when you were told not to show off so much? We're doing all these fancy things instead, and it's not worth it! You need to lighten up a little!

<blank>

And then he pulled me close to his face and whispered in a small, dusky voice! Even Mia is nodding her head!

Oh, yeah? Why? I'm safe, right? And now I'm being told by someone who doesn't weigh in to weigh in?

<blank>

I muttered something like, "I'm out, I'm out, I'm out," to which Bibi, who picked up on my muttering, gave me a hard stare! He said to me, "You're out, you're out!" ......
