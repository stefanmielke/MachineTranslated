# Episode 50: Suzy Cloud's Survival Part 2

There are some cruel expressions.

Especially for those who love rabbits, please be careful!

----------------

<b>

<b>

The small hill I chose as my campsite isn't very high.

There are several higher hills around, making it look buried from the surroundings.

<b>

If I go down the hill to the north, that’s where the safe zone ends.

I can see that Aria and the others are stationed on that northern hill.

<b>

I think they are guarding this area to be cautious of anything outside the safe zone.

<b>

<b>

The sun is now directly overhead, and it's already noon.

<b>

I've finished setting up the tent, and the camping preparations are mostly complete.

I was delayed a bit by the "Brown Crawler," but thanks to that, the work has gone quite smoothly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

I set up the tent by stretching a rope between two trees and hanging a triangular tent from it.

It looks like a triangle prism laid on its side.

I stretched the rope between the trees to the east and made the east side the entrance.

I also set up a small stove next to it.

<b>

I also… made a toilet.

It would be best to make it on the north side where the sun doesn't shine, but there are hills where Aria and the others are.

I would definitely be seen!! No way!!

But the sunny south side feels different; I can't say such things!

So, I decided to dig a hole on the south side and surround it with stakes made from cut trees.

It seems like it should only be a temporary setup for a week, but has it turned into something a bit more serious?

<b>

When I was camping before, I didn't even think about the toilet.

<b>

I was always near water, so I just went there.

More than anything, I was doing quite embarrassing things while saying, "The female body is so interesting!!"

Looking back now, it's outrageous! That was just perverted!! I can feel my face heating up just remembering it.

How could I do something like that?! Ahhh, I don't want to think about it!

<b>

But at that time, I thought it was a dream at first, so I was holding back until I couldn't anymore, thinking, "If I do it, my bedding will be a mess! Bedwetting at my age is no joke!" 

But after I exceeded my limit and did it, I also "let loose."

That being said, that was terrible! Am I an idiot?! I can't believe it!!

<b>

<b>

Sigh… But looking back, that camping trip was a cheat camping experience where I used items like crazy.

I could set up and take down the tent in an instant, and it was hassle-free.

<b>

But this time, I'm going to do everything properly with my own hands! I’ve grown up! Yes!

After all, I can now dismantle prey! I can!

<b>

Who puts a bird into the fire without plucking its feathers?! Are you an idiot?

You have to properly skin the bird first! Right?

<b>

<b>

While thinking about such things, I started boiling water over the stove I made from piled stones and began preparing my meal.

My stomach has been growling for a while now.

Since no one is around to hear it, it’s a good thing… what a lack of patience!

<b>

That said… is this camping trip also a cheat? More than anything, this magic is so convenient!

<b>

The water in the pot was summoned using water attribute magic.

Isn't it impressive that I can summon just the right amount?

I'm not the same person who summoned a water sphere the size of a light car!

<b>

Well, it might be a cheat camping experience precisely because I can make such fine adjustments… but it’s still convenient.

<b>

Digging a hole is also done in an instant with earth attribute magic.

This might be because I possess all attributes, making me a convenient existence like a ten-special knife.

<b>

For now, I decided to make some tea and open my lunch for my meal.

<b>

This is the only food I was allowed to bring from home.

I’m allowed to carry salt, pepper, and some herbs, but food is basically foraged locally, so this will be my first and last regular meal during the trial.

<b>

It was the lunch that Sonia Mama gave me, saying, "Eat it carefully, okay?"

When I opened the lid of the small basket, what appeared was a deer meat cutlet sandwich and a BLT.

It was the first lunch Sonia Mama made for me.

<b>

Taking a bite, the sweet and spicy sauce flavor spread in my mouth.

<b>

Ah, it really tastes the same as back then.

<b>

As I felt joy, my vision suddenly distorted.

<b>

"Ugh… ugh… eh, ugh…"

<b>

I couldn't help but sob.

Tears started to flow continuously.

The taste of memories brought something overflowing.

<b>

I won't be able to eat Sonia Mama's home-cooked meals for a while.

I won't be able to see Sonia Mama or Howard Papa until the trial is over.

<b>

Thinking that made tears flow uncontrollably.

<b>

It's only been a week, but why can I cry so easily?

Just thinking that I won't see them makes me cry…

<b>

I thought the same thing during dinner that day, but I really feel like a little child.

Is the spirit of my new body that immature?

<b>

Feeling like my heart might tear from loneliness, I took a bite of my lunch.

I chewed each bite, swallowing it along with my tears.

<b>

<b>

By the time I had my after-meal tea, my heart had calmed down.

<b>

No matter how disturbed my heart is, I think it's amazing that I can quickly regain my composure.

<b>

It's not that I become emotionless.

While I properly encompass the waves my heart feels, my spirit remains calm… that’s how it feels.

Could this mean that the surface of my spirit has become deeper and wider?

<b>

<b>

That said… I was careless.

I was careless enough to cry over just a cutlet sandwich… It’s only been a few hours since Howard Papa worried about me before I left; what a thing to happen.

I can't let Howard Papa find out! I must keep this a secret!!

<b>

Hah! But wait! This is within the line of sight of Aria and the others!

It might be inconvenient for them if they can't see me at all, so I trimmed the bushes and trees to make sure I was just barely visible.

This spot where I'm eating should be clear from Aria and the others' view!

<b>

Crap! They might have seen me crying while eating!

Eep! Aria! Please keep this a secret from Papa! He'll definitely worry so much!!

<b>

<b>

…Sigh, but I can't stay down forever; I have things to do.

Still, I finished setting up camp in half a day.

Normally, preparing the campsite from the ground up would take a whole day, but… magic really is a cheat.

<b>

I've just finished eating, but I need to think about gathering food soon.

The food I brought is finished with the lunch I just ate.

I'm not allowed to carry any more, so for the remaining week, I have to forage for food locally.

<b>

<b>

For now, I think I'll tidy up here a bit before heading out to hunt.

<b>

First, I'll turn the leftover wood from the toilet area into firewood.

But this might not be enough for a week, so I think I'll cut down a few more suitable trees.

<b>

Since it's meant for firewood, I chose trees about 20 centimeters in diameter to cut down.

This time, I focused my energy on my bush knife and tried cutting.

I can't concentrate as much energy as with a sword, but it cuts quite easily.

<b>

Maybe if I channel energy into a stick, it might cut just as easily.

Should I give it a try?

<b>

I picked a suitable twig from the small branches lying around.

As I focused my energy on it, it became enveloped in a buzzing sensation.

I felt an image of a thin film of light surrounding the twig.

It feels like a lightsaber!

When I swing it, it makes a buzzing sound, and I'm super excited?!!

<b>

With that, I swung the twig to cut down a nearby trunk.

<b>

With a loud crash, the trunk shattered.

It didn’t cut; it felt like it was broken.

The twig I was holding also shattered into pieces.

It felt like it exploded from the inside.

The tree was also forcibly broken, and it’s in a state that can’t be said to be neatly cut.

<b>

Hmm, what does this mean?

If I judge by the situation, it means the twig I was holding didn't have the sharpness to cut anything?

Since I just wrapped it in energy, it just became a "sturdy twig"…?

And since I channeled enough energy to break the tree, the twig couldn't withstand it…

…Is that how it is?

<b>

Hmm, this broken twig seemed like it could break just by channeling a bit more energy.

<b>

After all, channeling energy into a twig to use it as a weapon might be a difficult task.

<b>

Maybe it can at most increase its strength? But if I channel too much, it might break?

But for pinpoint enhancement, maybe I don't need to channel that much energy?

If I make just the tip as strong as iron? If I make it like a weight, could it be used like a mace?

<b>

No, no, no! No! I'm not making a mace! I'm trying to cut down a tree!

Then, I should create a high-strength part with a thin line.

<b>

If I wrap a razor-thin, sharp, and strong blade around the twig… could I do it?

<b>

<b>

Let’s give it a try…

<b>

I held the newly picked twig and crouched in front of a tree.

The tip of the twig… or rather, the end of the twig.

I held it down to the right and prepared it.

Is this called a side stance?

<b>

While exhaling gently, I began to channel "energy" into the twig.

Anyway, I’ll make it thin like a razor with a small amount.

<b>

Ah, this is really difficult?! There’s a lot of unevenness inside the twig, and it feels all jumbled up?!

It’s easy for the "energy" to flow, but it feels extremely uneven?

<b>

If I compare it, if a sword is a paved road, this is a wasteland.

The absorption is good, but it bumps here and there and is unstable.

If I force it through, it might snap.

Fine adjustments are really hard?!

<b>

It seems like I need quite a bit of training to channel it smoothly.

Hmm, have I found something to do during this trial?

<b>

Well, setting that aside, I’ll take care of the task in front of me.

<b>

Still crouching, I exhaled sharply and swung the twig.

<b>

In an instant.

<b>

The trunk I swung the twig at slid down and fell to the ground.

I felt the vibration of the tree falling at my feet.

<b>

Hmm, I think I managed to do it?

The tree was cut, but the twig I was holding is all battered.

This needs practice.

<b>

But if I can master this, it would be pretty good, right?

Picking up a twig from the ground and taking down enemies with it would feel so cool and masterful, right?

Hehe, I’ll practice hard♪

<b>

<b>

After that, I cut the fallen trees into suitable lengths.

Since they need to fit in the stove, about 30 to 40 centimeters long, I think?

<b>

I practiced channeling energy into the twigs as I cut them.

It took surprisingly long, with some going well and others not.

<b>

I stacked the cut wood and used magic.

Combining fire, wind, and water attributes, I used the spell "Dry."

It’s a magic that extracts water from the wood and dries it with hot wind.

<b>

It’s amazing how fresh wood turns into firewood in an instant; magic really is a cheat.

<b>

<b>

After tidying up the thicket and the pile of firewood, the campsite feels settled now.

<b>

Making firewood while training took surprisingly long.

It’s already past 4 o'clock.

<b>

The spring days are still short.

The sun will set soon.

<b>

Normally, on the first day, it seems good enough to secure a camping spot…

<b>

But since I’m here, I might as well hunt!

I know there are prey within my detection range!

I’ll quickly go catch something♪

<b>

Actually, I could see that there was prey about 100 meters east from here.

<b>

I put my sword back into its holster and equipped myself.

Then, I swiftly headed towards the prey.

<b>

Ah, but I won't move at a ridiculous speed, okay? Just a fast movement within the bounds of common sense?

I can be considerate since there are eyes around, you know?

<b>

I made sure to make no sound as I approached that spot.

It was a small valley, with water flowing, making it a little stream.

From behind a rock by the brook, it peeked out, twitching its nose.

It was a horned rabbit.

Was it coming to drink water while being cautious of its surroundings?

<b>

The distance is about 20 meters.

<b>

It seems to be sniffing around cautiously? But from its perspective, I’m downwind.

It hasn’t noticed me yet.

I’m not using any stealth skills or anything.

I’m just approaching while holding my breath.

<b>

Well, that alone might make my presence disappear, creating a "rock mimic" state.

<b>

I pulled out a slow-throw knife from the sheath hanging at my waist and held it in my right hand.

Without any delay, I threw the knife with an underhand throw.

The knife flew towards the prey, spinning rapidly as it skimmed the ground.

<b>

For a moment, the horned rabbit seemed to notice the sound cutting through the air, but the next moment, the knife struck its forehead with a thud.

The horned rabbit's head jerked back from the impact and then became still.

<b>

Yes! I got it!

<b>

It's quite big, about a meter long? Maybe the size of a Shiba Inu?

This should be enough food for several days.

<b>

Since this is a water source, I think I’ll dismantle it right here.

<b>

I took a thin rope from one of the pouches attached to my belt, quickly tied it to the hind legs of the horned rabbit, and secured it to a nearby branch.

<b>

Then, I began to skin it.

I used the sheath knife tied to its legs for the dismantling.

<b>

This method of cutting open the body while leaving the legs intact is quite gruesome visually.

<b>

But when I was first taught how to do it, I was a bit taken aback… but I got used to it quickly.

I guess my resistance to gore has significantly increased since coming here.

I don’t think I’ve become insensitive…

I guess my mental capacity has grown larger?

<b>

I pulled the skin down smoothly.

It peeled off cleanly, like taking off a shirt.

<b>

Once I cut off the horns and ears and removed the fur, it looked like just meat.

I quickly took it down from the branch and carried it to the riverbank, opening its belly to remove and wash the intestines.

<b>

While washing the blood away in the river's flow, I carefully cleaned the intestines.

<b>

I can eat the meat tonight, but it won’t taste very good unless it’s aged for 2-3 days.

So tonight, it’s a hormone party!

<b>

Fresh horned rabbit intestines are quite delicious!

<b>

Drooling! Oh no, I shouldn’t be like this… how uncouth of me.

<b>

<b>

<b>

As the sun dipped behind the mountains, the valley where this stream is became dim.

Here, it gets dark quickly.

I need to finish up quickly and return to camp.

<b>

<b>

I took the cleaned intestines and pulled out a bag from another pouch to put them in.

I also wrapped the meat in cloth.

Additionally, there were edible wild plants in this stream, so I decided to gather some.

I wrapped those in another cloth and quickly left the stream to return to the campsite.

<b>

When I returned to the campsite, it was at a slightly higher elevation than the stream, so I could still see the sun in the western sky.

However, in about 30 minutes, the sun will likely set behind the mountains.

<b>

I should start a fire in the stove while I can.

I grabbed a handful of twigs and a thick log and put them in the stove, chanting "Fire."

The twigs ignited immediately, and the flames spread to the log.

<b>

Hmm, magic really is a cheat.

<b>

I spread out the materials from the prey I caught.

In about an hour, I’ve made quite a harvest, huh, heh♪

<b>

I’d like to store the rabbit meat for two to three days to let it age.

Maybe I should put it in a stone-walled room I made underground?

<b>

Ah, but I’ll use the ribs today.

<b>

First, I’ll use the rock salt I brought to scrub and wash them thoroughly!

I’ll use plenty of crushed rock salt to wash it.

<b>

After rubbing the salt all over the meat, I cut off the ribs and stored the rest in the stone chamber.

<b>

<b>

The stone chamber I made is also quite a cheat.

I used earth attribute "Rock Block" to create the rock, which I then cut into boards with the silver sword and assembled.

The stone table I’m using as a cutting board is also made from cut rock.

<b>

Well, normally, you can’t cut rock… can you?… Hmm.

But that’s because Marsh-san is skilled!

I think it’s because this sword made by Marsh-san is amazing! Yes! That’s it! Thanks to that, I’m getting to enjoy myself! Hahaha!

<b>

<b>

More importantly! …I put the cut ribs into a pot with water and put it on the fire.

I might as well throw in some of the intestines too.

<b>

Ah, I really want root vegetables…

I could make a delicious stew with just root vegetables and intestines… Oh, right! I should hunt another 1-2 tomorrow and make "motsunabe"! Since it’s fresh, it should taste good even in a hot pot.

<b>

<b>

I’ll throw in the wild plants I gathered too.

<b>

This is a wild plant called "Nobiru." It looks like a cluster of thin green onions.

Since it grows in clusters, it just looks like a weed.

<b>

When you pull it out, the base forms a round bulb.

It’s not as big as an onion, but about the size of a shallot? It tastes spicy like ginger.

The roots of this Nobiru are much larger than the ones I know.

If I chop this and add it, it should help remove the gamey smell.

<b>

There was also "Fuki."

This is also much thicker than the ones I know.

The "Fuki" in this area has a bitterness like celery, but it’s addictive.

If I put it in the soup, it will add a good flavor, so I’ll add this too!

<b>

I blanched the Fuki in a small separate pot, removed the fibers, and cut it into bite-sized pieces to add to the soup.

<b>

As I simmered it carefully, skimming off the scum, it started to look good.

I adjusted the flavor with salt and pepper and added a pinch of the spices I brought.

Whoa! It suddenly became spicy?!

I’ll taste a spoonful… Hmm, the soup seems about right?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suddenly realizing that the sun had completely set, the surroundings were now pitch dark.

In the forest with no lights, only the fire from the stove illuminated the darkness.

The brightness of the fire transformed the area into an orange world.

<b>

I might have gotten a bit too absorbed in the pot.

<b>

I transferred the fire from the stove to a lantern and placed the small light on the table.

Now, shall we start dinner?

<b>

I served the soup into a bowl and replaced the grill on the stove.

I’ll enjoy it while grilling the intestines on top.

The intestines have been rubbed with the salt I brought after washing off the rock salt.

<b>

While waiting for them to grill, I sipped the soup.

<b>

Hmm, the flavor of the horned rabbit broth is really coming through.

I wonder if it would taste deeper with root vegetables?

But this is delicious as it is.

It has a wonderfully wild flavor.

<b>

Eventually, the intestines finished grilling.

Ah, the aroma rising is irresistible!!

<b>

I quickly tossed a piece of the white, curled meat into my mouth.

As I chewed, the fat spread in my mouth.

<b>

"Ah… so good! Shirokoro, so delicious!!"

<b>

It’s different from what I used to eat, but I’d say it’s even better!

Ahhh… the fat, the fat is really delicious!

The heart is also so crunchy!

The liver, eaten with salt, is also! Is it because it’s fresh that it tastes this good?!

<b>

I want beer! I want beer! Please give me beer! Beer!!

<b>

…Oops, excuse me, that was just a cry of my soul… it’s that delicious!

<b>

<b>

Well, at 14 years old, drinking alcohol is OUT.

I really want to drink beer with intestines when I’m old enough!

In this place, drinking is only allowed at twenty, so it really is a law-abiding country!

<b>

But I know that beer exists in this world!

Howard Papa doesn’t drink much beer, but he seems to like malt whiskey and often enjoys it alone.

I hope that someday I can join him for a drink.

<b>

<b>

Before I knew it, I had completely finished the prepared intestines.

I plan to have the soup for breakfast tomorrow, so I still have some left.

<b>

After washing the dishes and tidying up, I should quickly prepare for bed.

It was an early morning today, and staying up late in the night forest feels a bit off.

<b>

Well, during my previous camping trip, I spent most of the time… doing that…

I-I’ll do it again tonight… you know.

Yeah, there’s nothing else to do… so I’ll just get into the tent quickly.

<b>

So, I tidied up the surroundings, threw some magic beast repellent incense wood into the stove, and entered the tent.

The smoke from this incense wood is said to keep weak magical beasts, like those in the safe zone, away.

So if I throw a piece into the fire, I can spend the night safely in the safe zone.

<b>

<b>

As soon as I entered the tent, I took off my gear and slipped into my sleeping bag in just my underwear.

I would have preferred a blanket, but it’s a bit bulky.

It’s only a week, so I went with a small, foldable sleeping bag.

But it’s warm enough.

<b>

Now, the nights in the forest are long.

I’ll be spending a week like this, so I should enjoy it fully♪

<b>

Ah, I have to be careful with my voice!

In the forest, I’ve unconsciously promised myself that it’s okay to speak loudly! I need to be careful!

I think it should be fine, but if Aria and the others notice, it would be a big deal!!

<b>

Oh right! Tomorrow morning… when I wake up, I should… take a bath in the stream… yeah…

<b>

----------------

"I'm really glad there's a stream nearby. Being able to wash my body right after waking up is such a relief, especially since I got so dirty yesterday!"

"Should I wash my underwear too? It feels so liberating to bathe naked during the day♪ Hehe?"

"What?! A gaze!!! No way! Where? Where from?! Above?! ...Ah, Millie-san? Oh no! This is within the visibility area of Aria's camp?! Did I get seen?! Did they see my butt?! Ugh, Millie-san… my butt…"

Next time: "Millie Barrett's Report"
