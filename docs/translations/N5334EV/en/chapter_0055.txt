# 50 Survival of Suzy Cloud, Part 2

Some scenes may be cruel.

Especially rabbit lovers, please beware!


----------------

<blank>

<blank>

The small mountain I chose for my campsite is not that high.

There are several hills around it that are higher than this one, and it is buried from the surroundings.

<blank>

If you go down the hillside to the north, that is where the safe zone ends.

On the hillside to the north of them, you can see that Aria and her group are camped out.

<blank>

I think they are guarding us to keep us outside the safe zone.

<blank>

<blank>

The sun is directly overhead now, and it is already noon.

<blank>

The tents have been set up and most of the preparations for encampment are in place.

I think it's thanks to the fact that the work went pretty smoothly, except for the time taken to deal with the "Brown Crawler".

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The tents were pitched on ropes between trees, and the triangular tents were pitched so that they could be hooked onto the ropes.

It's like a triangular pillar turned on its side.

Ropes were set up between the trees on the east and west sides, so the east side was used as the entrance and exit.

A small cooking stove is also set up beside it.

<blank>

And the toilet...made.

It would be best to build it on the north side where it is hard to get sunlight, but there is a hillside to the north where Aria and her family are.

You will definitely see it! Zettaiada!

But I think the south side where the sun shines is different, but I can't say that!

So we decided to dig a hole on the south side and surround it with stakes made of felled trees.

It was only supposed to be temporary for a week, but it turned out to be something a little more serious, didn't it?

<blank>

When I was in the field before, I didn't even worry about the bathroom.

<blank>

It was always by the water, so I used to do my business there.

Above all, 'A woman's body is so interesting! and doing some pretty embarrassing things.

Now that I think about it, it's outrageous! That was just perverted! I can feel my face burning just remembering it.

How could I have done that? Aaahhhh, no more yada yada yada!

<blank>

But at first I thought it was a dream, and if I did it, the futon would be in big trouble! I was too old to be wetting the bed! I was holding back to the limit.

But I've been over the limit, and I've been 'haha' since I've done it.

But that doesn't mean that that thing is terrible! Am I an idiot? I can't believe it!

<blank>

<blank>

Haha...but now that I think about it, I was a cheat camp using a lot of items during that field trip.

The tents were in and out in an instant, and it was hassle-free.

<blank>

But this time I'm doing it from scratch with my own hands! I've grown up, you know! Yeah!

After all, I can dismantle my prey! I am!

<blank>

What kind of a bimbo puts a bird in the fire without even picking its feathers? Are you crazy?

I'll strip the bird naked and take it apart! Okay?

<blank>

<blank>

With these thoughts in mind, I began to prepare for the meal by boiling water in a hearth made of piled stones.

My stomach has been cooing since a while ago.

It's a good thing there's no one else listening... you no patience!

<blank>

But still... is this encampment a cheat after all? Above all, this magic is useful, isn't it?

<blank>

The water in the pot was also invoked by water-based magic.

It's great that you're getting out just the right amount, isn't it?

We are no longer the same person as the guy who was suddenly serving water polo as big as a light car!

<blank>

Well, this kind of fine-tuning may be the reason for the cheat encampment...but it's still useful.

<blank>

And digging a hole is just a matter of seconds with the earth attribute.

This may be due in part to the fact that I have all attributes, which makes me a useful person like a special knife.

<blank>

Anyway, I made some tea and opened my lunch box for lunch.

<blank>

This is the only food and meal that you are allowed to bring from home.

They are allowed to carry salt, pepper, and a few herbs, but food is basically procured locally, so this will be their first and last daily meal during the ordeal.

<blank>

Sonia's mother gave me this lunch box and told me to take good care of it.　It is a lunch box given to me by Sonia's mother.

When I opened the lid of the small basket, what appeared was a venison cutlet sandwich and a BLT.

It was the first lunch Sonia Mama made for me.

<blank>

The flavor of the sweet and spicy sauce spreads in your mouth as you take a bite.

<blank>

Oh, it still tastes the same as it did then.

<blank>

I felt happy and at the same time, my vision was distorted with a gnawing feeling.

<blank>

"Ee...ee...ee...ee..."

<blank>

Sobs break out on their own.

Tears spill over later and later.

The taste of memories came flooding in something.

<blank>

Now I won't be able to eat Sonia Mama's home-cooked food for a while.

I can't see Sonia Mama or Howard Papa until the ordeal is over.

<blank>

When I thought of that, I started to cry on my own.

<blank>

It's only been a week, how can I cry so easily?

I can't believe I'm crying just at the thought of not seeing you two....

<blank>

I thought the same thing at dinner that night, but I really feel like a little kid.

Is the spirit of this new body of mine that immature?

<blank>

I sipped my lunch, feeling my heart shredding with loneliness.

Chew each bite and swallow with tears.

<blank>

<blank>

By the time I sipped my after-dinner tea, my mind had regained its composure.

<blank>

No matter how disturbed my mind is, I am amazed that I can regain my composure immediately.

<blank>

It is not that I am unsympathetic.

While properly encompassing the waves my heart felt, my spirit is calm...that's how I feel.

Does this mean that the surface of the water, which we call the spirit, is getting deeper and wider?

<blank>

<blank>

But still...it was bypassed.

I had no idea that a single pork cutlet sandwich could make her cry so much... How could I have said that when it had only been a few hours since Howard's father had worried about her on the way out?

I can't let Howard Papa know about this! This has to be kept a strictly confidential matter!

<blank>

Ha! But wait! This is within sight of Aria and the others!

Would it be inconvenient for them to be completely out of sight of Aria and the others who were escorting them? I trimmed the bushes and trees appropriately and made them just barely visible.

This place where we are eating should have a clear view from Aria and the others!

<blank>

Kuh! Maybe they saw me crying while eating!

Hi~! Aria! Please don't tell my dad! I'm sure he'll be worried to death!

<blank>

<blank>

Still, I can't stay depressed forever, and I have to do what I have to do.

Still, it only took me half a day to prepare the encampment.

If it were true, it would have taken a whole day to prepare the groundwork for the encampment...but magic is a cheat, isn't it?

<blank>

We just finished eating, but we need to think about getting some food early.

The food we brought with us ended up in the lunch we just ate.

They are not allowed to have more than that, so they have to get food locally for the rest of the week.

<blank>

<blank>

I think I'll go out hunting after cleaning up a little more of this place for now.

<blank>

First, let's use the leftover wood from the toilet surround as firewood.

But this seems a little short for a week's worth, so I'm going to cut down a few more suitable trees.

<blank>

Since the trees are supposed to be used as firewood, we selected trees with a diameter of about 20 cm and cut them down.

This time I saw a bush knife clad in Ki and cut.

It can't hold as much as a sword, but it cuts with a snap quite easily.

<blank>

Maybe if I run Ki through a piece of stick, it will snap off in the same way.

Let's give it a try, shall we?

<blank>

I selected a suitable one from among the twigs I paid from the branches that had fallen around there.

I let the ki flow through me, and with a "whomp" the twig was covered in ki.

The image feels as if a thin film of light is covering the area around the twigs.

It's kind of like a lai0-saver!

When I swing it around, it feels like it's making a buzzing sound, and I get really agitated!

<blank>

As it was, he swung the twig in his grip to cut down a nearby trunk.

<blank>

Gasgoggons! and the trunk was pulverized.

It's not like it snapped, it's like it snapped.

The branch he was holding was also shattered into pieces.

It already feels like it's been blasted and ripped apart from the inside.

The tree was also forcibly broken and is not in a very clean cut.

<blank>

Hmmm, what does this mean?

Judging by the circumstances alone, I'd say the branch you were holding wasn't sharp enough to cut things?

It's just a "strong branch" because it's just clothed with Ki...?

I was so strong that I could break the tree, and the branch couldn't stand it.

I wonder if it's like...?

<blank>

Hmmm, this shattered branch would have shattered by itself if I had put a little more Ki into it...

<blank>

I guess it is difficult to put Ki into a branch and use it as a weapon.

<blank>

Can we at best increase the strength of the cage? If you increase the amount of cage too much, will it shatter?

But if it's a pinpoint reinforcement, do you have to put so much Ki into it?

Why don't you just make the tip like iron? If we make it look like a weight, can we use it like a mace?

<blank>

No, no, no! No, no, no! We're not making mace! We're trying to cut down a tree!

Then, do you pinpoint and make a strong area with thin lines?

<blank>

If we could clothe the branches with a razor-thin, sharp, strong blade...could we do that?

<blank>

<blank>

Let's give it a try....

<blank>

He sat down in front of one of the trees with a newly picked up branch.

The tip of the cut...or the tip of the branch.

I held it with the tip of the branch down to the lower right.

Was it something called a "side stance"?

<blank>

Then, while exhaling thinly, I put "Ki" into the branch.

In any case, use a small amount and thinly and thinly like a razor blade.

<blank>

Oh, is this very difficult? Is there a very bumpy, jumbled feeling in the branches?

If I say "Ki" is easy to pass through, it is easy to pass through, but it is very uneven.

<blank>

By analogy, if the sword is a paved road, this is a wasteland.

The suction is good, but it's not stable because it's all over the place.

If you force it through, it might snap off.

How hard is it to make fine adjustments?

<blank>

It takes a lot of practice to get this through cleanly.

Ummm, did I find something to do during this ordeal?

<blank>

Well, that's that, but for now, let's get the job done.

<blank>

He sits back, lets out a short breath, and shakes out the twig in his hand.

<blank>

Blink of an eye.

<blank>

The trunk, which had been swung out of the twig, slid down and fell straight to the ground.

The vibration of the tree falling is felt underfoot.

<blank>

Hm, did we manage it?

The tree is cut, but the branch I'm holding is also in shreds.

This is something I need to practice!

<blank>

But it would be nice to be able to use this thing, wouldn't it?

Isn't it cool to pick up a fallen branch and beat the enemy to a pulp, like an expert?

Uhi, let's practice a little harder.

<blank>

<blank>

The cut down trees were then cut down from one end to the appropriate length.

It's long enough to fit in the hearth, so I'd say 3 to 40 cm.

<blank>

I let the branches be covered with "Ki" and cut them to practice.

It went well and poorly, and took a surprisingly long time.

<blank>

The cut trees are stacked and used for magic.

Dry" combines the three attributes of fire, wind, and water.

The magic is that water is sucked out of the wood from the inside and dried by hot air.

<blank>

I knew magic was a cheat, turning raw wood into firewood in an instant.

<blank>

<blank>

I wonder if the encampment is feeling settled after clearing out the cleared bushes and woodpiles.

<blank>

It took a surprisingly long time to make firewood for my training.

It's already around 4:00.

<blank>

Daytime in early spring is still short.

The sun will soon set.

<blank>

If true, it sounds like the first day would be good if we could find a place to encamp....

<blank>

Let's do some hunting anyway!

We know our prey has been in range for a while now!

Let's go catch a quick one...

<blank>

In fact, I had a vision of my prey about 100 meters east of here.

<blank>

At one point, he puts his sword back in his sword holster and adjusts his equipment.

As it is, it promptly heads for its prey.

<blank>

Oh, but not at ridiculous speeds, okay? I'm just moving fast within the bounds of common sense, okay?

I can do that much consideration because I have human eyes, you know?

<blank>

I head for the place, careful not to make a sound with my footsteps.

It is a small valley, with water running through it and a little stream.

He was peeking out from behind a rock in the stream, his nose twitching.

Horned rabbit.

Did they come for a drink of water while keeping a wary eye on their surroundings?

<blank>

The distance is a little over 20 meters.

<blank>

He's looking around like he's on alert, isn't he? But this is downwind from him.

We have not noticed this one yet.

It's not like he's using some kind of hide-and-seek skill.

I just approach them normally, breathlessly.

<blank>

Well, that alone might be a sign that the sign is gone, and it might be in a 'rock monster' kind of state.

<blank>

I pulled a throw-in knife from the knife sheath hanging at my waist and placed it in my right hand.

Without pausing, he underthrows and throws the knife away.

The knife is rotated vertically at high speed, crawling on the ground toward the prey.

<blank>

For a moment, Kakuusagi seemed to notice the sound of a knife slicing through the air, but the next moment, a knife was thrust between his eyes.

Kakusagi's head was thrown back by the force of the action, and he remained motionless.

<blank>

All right! I got him!

<blank>

It's pretty big, about a meter long? About the size of a Shiba Inu?

This should be enough food for a few days.

<blank>

At any rate, this is a watering hole, and I think I'll just dismantle it.

<blank>

He took a thin rope from one of the pouches attached to his belt, quickly tied it to Kakusagi's hind legs, and then tied it to a nearby tree branch.

<blank>

The rest of the skin is peeled off as it is.

Dismantling is done with a sheath knife strapped to the leg.

<blank>

I think this cutting open with a blade in the crotch, leaving the legs, is moderately egregious on the screen.

<blank>

But when I first learned how to do it, I was pretty taken back...but I got used to it pretty quickly.

I have a much higher tolerance for grotesqueries since I came here.

I don't think it's being insensitive...

I knew it. I wonder if it means that my mental capacity is getting bigger?

<blank>

Drag the skin downwards and off with a slurp.

It peels off cleanly like taking off a shirt.

<blank>

As it is, if you cut off the horns and ears and remove the fur, it looks like meat now.

Immediately, the fish is taken down from the tree and brought to the edge of the river, where its belly is opened, its internal organs removed, and washed.

<blank>

The blood is washed away with the running water of the river, and the entrails are carefully washed away as well.

<blank>

The meat can be eaten tonight, but it needs to be aged for a couple of days before it tastes ammalicious!

So tonight is a hormone party!

<blank>

The guts of fresh horned rabbits are quite tasty!

<blank>

Oh, no, I'm drooling! Oops, I drooled... I shouldn't have done that.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The sun was shining in the shadow of the mountain, and this stream, a valley, was already getting dim.

It will be dark in a few more days here.

Let's make it quick and head back to camp.

<blank>

<blank>

The cleaned offal is taken out of a bag from another pouch and placed in it.

The body of the horned rabbit was also wrapped in cloth.

There were also some edible wildflowers in the stream, so we decided to pick some.

We wrapped this in another piece of cloth and immediately left the stream and headed back to the encampment.

<blank>

Returning to the campsite, the sun was still visible in the western sky because it was a little higher than the stream.

But the sun will set between the mountains in less than half an hour.

<blank>

While we're at it, we'll fire up the hearth.

He brought a handful of twigs and a thick piece of firewood, put it in the hearth, and chanted 《Fire》.

Immediately the twigs catch fire and the fire goes around the wood.

<blank>

Ummm, I knew it, magic cheat.

<blank>

Spread the material of the catch.

That's quite an accomplishment in an hour.

<blank>

I'd keep the rabbit meat for a couple of days to let it mature.

Can I put this in a stone walled room I built in the dirt?

<blank>

Oh, but I'll only use the abdomen area today.

<blank>

First, the guts are rubbed with rock salt that was picked up from the market!

They wash with a generous amount of crushed rock salt.

<blank>

After rubbing the meat with the salt I had brought with me, I cut off the abdomen and put the rest in the stone chamber.

<blank>

<blank>

It's a good cheat to have built this stone room.

It's a piece of rock that was put out by the "rock block" of the earth attribute, cut out with a silvery white sword, and assembled into a board.

The stone table that I am now using as a cutting board is also cut from a rock.

<blank>

Umm...usually, rocks can't be cut...right? ...un.

But that's because of Marsh's skill!

Don't think that means this sword that Mr. Marsh struck is awesome! Yeah! That's what I'm saying! I guess that means you're making things easier for me! Ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

<blank>

It doesn't matter! ...Put the cut out abalone area in a pot with water and put it on the fire.

I think I'll just bung the offal in at the end as well.

<blank>

Oh, I still want root vegetables....

I could make a delicious stew with just root vegetables and offal...Oh, yes! I think I'll hunt down another chicken or two tomorrow and make a "motsu nabe". Since they're fresh, they'll probably taste good enough to be cooked in mizutaki.

<blank>

<blank>

Let's also include the wild vegetables we picked.

<blank>

This is a wildflower called "nobile. It is a wildflower that grows in clusters and looks like a thin leek.

They look like weeds because they grow in clusters.

<blank>

This is a round bulb at the base when pulled out.

Not as big as an onion, but about the size of a rakkyo. Tastes like root ginger and has a delicious spiciness.

The roots of this nobile are much larger than the ones I know.

Chopping this up and putting it in would help remove the smell.

<blank>

There was also "Butterbur".

It is also much thicker than what I know.

The "butterbur" of this land has a bitter taste like celery, but it's habit-forming.

It gives a good flavor if you put it in the soup, so let's put this one in too!

<blank>

Once the butterbur was boiled in a small separate pot, the surrounding strands were removed, cut into bite-sized pieces, and added to the soup.

<blank>

The lye was carefully removed and boiled down to a good consistency.

I seasoned it with salt and pepper and added a pinch of the spices I had brought.

Oh, no! It suddenly smells spicy, doesn't it?

I'll take a sip and taste it...hmmm, is this what the soup is like?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suddenly I realized that the sun had set and it was already dark around me.

In the forest without a single light, only the fire of the hearth opens up the darkness.

The brightness of the fire had turned the vicinity into an orange world.

<blank>

Did I get a little too carried away with the pot?

<blank>

Transfer the fire from the hearth to the lantern and add that little light to the table.

Well, let's get dinner started.

<blank>

I served the soup on a plate and replaced the net on the stove.

The hormone is grilled and served on top of this.

The hormone is washed off with rock salt and then rubbed with the salt and pepper I brought.

<blank>

Sip the soup until it is cooked.

<blank>

Yes, the soup stock from the horned rabbit is amazing.

I still wonder if the root vegetables would add more depth of flavor?

But this is delicious.

What a wild flavor, I think.

<blank>

Eventually, the hormones came to be grilled.

Oh, the smell that rises is unbearable!

<blank>

The white, rounded meat is immediately thrown into the mouth.

When you bite into it, the fat spreads in your mouth.

<blank>

Oh...ugh! Shirokoro, ugh!"

<blank>

It's not what I used to eat often, but I can tell you that it's even better!

Ahhh...the fat, the fat is really delicious!

The hearty pork is also very tender!

The liver served with salt is also delicious! It's so tasty because it's fresh!

<blank>

I want beer! I want beer! Beer, please! Beer, please!

<blank>

I'm sorry, I just had a cry of my soul .........that's how good hormones are!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, as I said, drinking is OUT at 14 nowadays.

When I'm old enough to drink, I really want to go out for beer with hormones!

Since drinking is only allowed at the age of 20, this is a real law-abiding country, isn't it?

<blank>

But I know there is beer in this world!

Howard doesn't drink much beer, but he seems to like malt whisky, which he often sips by himself.

I hope to be able to accompany you someday, though.

<blank>

<blank>

Before I knew it, the hormones I had prepared had been neatly devoured.

The soup is still left over, though, because I plan to have it for breakfast tomorrow morning.

<blank>

After washing and cleaning up the dishes, we should promptly get ready for bed.

It was early this morning, and I'm not sure what it would be like to stay up late in the woods at night.

<blank>

Well, we had been there most of the time when we were camping before......so....

Tonight...I'll do it again...but...you know.

Well, I don't have anything else to do...so I'll just get into my tent and...do it.

<blank>

So, I cleaned up around the tent, threw some aromatic wood into the stove to ward off evil beasts, and went into the tent.

The smoke from the fragrant wood is said to keep even weak magical beasts in the safe zone away.

So if you put a piece of it on the fire, he said, you can stay safe in the safe zone until morning.

<blank>

<blank>

Once inside the tent, I immediately removed my gear and crawled into my shrug, wearing only my underwear.

I really wanted to use a blanket, but it's a bit bulky.

It was only a week, and he decided on a shrug that could be folded into a smaller size.

But it's warm enough.

<blank>

Now, the night in the forest is long.

We're going to spend the rest of the week like this, and we're going to have a lot of fun.

<blank>

Oh, I have to be careful with my voice!

In the forest, I have made a promise to myself that it is okay to be loud! You have to be careful, don't you?

I'm sure it will be fine indeed, but it would be a disaster if Aria and the others found out!

<blank>

Yes, I know! Tomorrow morning...when I wake up, I'll have to take a ...... dip in the stream below...............................hmmm.



<blank>

----------------

I'm so glad there was a stream nearby. It's great to be able to wash up right after getting up in the morning, since I got so dirty yesterday!

"Let's wash our underwear together.......bathing naked in the daytime feels so liberating......hehe?"

What? Nani? Look at me! Oh, no! Where? Where? Up there? ...Oh, Millie? Oh, shit! Was this place within visual range of Aria's campsite? Did they see us? Did they see you? Did they see my butt? Ugh, Millie... my butt..."

Next "Millie Barrett Reports."
