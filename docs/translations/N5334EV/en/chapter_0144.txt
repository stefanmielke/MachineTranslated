# Chapter 132: The Blonde-Rolled Saint

When Cordelia and the others turned around, they locked eyes with a gaze looking up at them from somewhat below their line of sight.

<b>

The owner of that gaze was watching them with a cautious yet unwavering stare.

Dressed in the same design of uniform as them, with a small shoulder bag, she even had a sword belt, albeit a small one.

And those eyes, though still young, conveyed a strong will.

<b>

"Oh! W-we're waiting for a friend here!"

<b>

As soon as she understood that the girl was her junior, Cordelia immediately reacted.

Her clumsiness was quite significant, but because of that, her ability to respond to others was top-notch.

<b>

"Are you from the elementary school? Good day. I am Cordelia Casper, a first-year student from the middle school."

"Oh, I am Annie Cloud, attending the elementary school from this year. I humbly ask for your kindness."

<b>

Catherine murmured, "As expected," at Cordelia's condescending tone.

Lucille looked at Annie, who responded firmly to Cordelia, with admiration.

<b>

While watching that cute curtsy, Lucille wondered if perhaps...?

<b>

"Good day, Miss Cloud. I am Lucille Moore. Are you perhaps a relative of Lady Suzy Cloud?"

"Do you know my sister Suzy?"

"Yes, I do."

"Really?! Then you must be Lady Cloud's younger sister? You certainly have a similar aura..."

"N-no, I am Lady Suzy's cousin... But! She always treats me very kindly!!"

<b>

With the mention of a mutual acquaintance, the slight tension between them began to ease.

<b>

Cordelia, having encountered such a lovely junior in a place like this, thought, "I might be able to get closer to Lady Cloud," and looked at Annie with slightly flushed cheeks.

<b>

On the other hand, Annie, while making a rather calm judgment, thought, "For a friend of Lady Suzy, she seems a bit different..."

<b>

"Is the friend you are waiting for Lady Suzy?"

"…Ah, no, I'm waiting for another friend… She's a classmate..."

<b>

Annie looked up at Cordelia's face, which was hesitating to speak.

<b>

But at that moment, the sound of a door being flung open from inside the building drew everyone's attention.

<b>

Looking towards the building, two small shadows were just about to burst out from the opened door.

<b>

"Annie big sister!"

"Big sister!"

<b>

"Dan! Nan! What’s wrong? You shouldn’t be outside!"

"We saw Annie big sister."

"And, there were other people too..."

<b>

The twins clung to Annie.

They had noticed Annie was outside and hurriedly rushed out, fearing there might be suspicious people around.

<b>

"…Did you just say Dan? And Nan?"

<b>

As soon as Cordelia heard the names of the two, her eyes widened, and she placed her hand over her mouth.

<b>

They were really here! And they had grown so much!!

<b>

The last time Cordelia saw the two was three years ago.

She was sure they were still three years old at that time.

Though she was anxious about whether they remembered her, Cordelia had known them since they were babies.

<b>

The newborn twin babies were incredibly cute, and she recalled how she and Karen would cling to the crib, getting excited whenever the sleeping babies moved even a little.

<b>

"Dan! Nan! Don’t you remember? It’s Cordelia! It’s me, Codi!"

<b>

Cordelia called out to the twins with overwhelming emotion, but the two just looked up at her with puzzled faces, still clinging to Annie.

<b>

"Do you know her?"

"Umm…?"

"Codi??"

<b>

Even in response to Annie's question, the twins looked at Cordelia with a puzzled expression.

<b>

"…Don’t you remember? Whenever I came to play at your mansion, you always welcomed me?"

<b>

To meet the twins' gaze, Cordelia knelt down and spread her arms wide.

Seeing her, the twins slowly released Annie and moved toward Cordelia.

Then, they began to intently stare at Cordelia's beautifully curled blonde hair, their little eyes wide open.

<b>

As Annie and the others watched, the twins gently touched Cordelia's hair with their small hands, as if to confirm it, intertwining their fingers in the curled blonde locks. And then...

<b>

"Ouch!!"

<b>

The two began to mercilessly tug at Cordelia's blonde curls with the strength of toddlers.

<b>

"Codi?"

"Codi!"

"Yes, yes! It’s Codi! I’m Codi! Ouch, it hurts! That hurts!"

<b>

The twins clung to Cordelia, each pulling her hair from either side while showing cheerful smiles.

<b>

"Ouch! Stop it already! You always pull my hair like this every time we meet... Ouch! Ouch! I’ll tell Karen on you!!"

<b>

Though Cordelia's words sounded angry, her face was filled with joy. She wrapped her arms around the twins, who were calling out "Codi! Codi!" and pulled them close.

<b>

"…I’m so glad. You’ve really grown so much... Are you eating well? Is your bed not too hard? Are you not feeling cold?"

"…We’re fine, Codi."

"Everyone is kind, so we’re okay."

<b>

As Cordelia hugged the twins, she gently rubbed her cheeks against their faces, quietly speaking to them.

<b>

"…If something difficult happens, make sure to tell me, okay?"

"We're fine. Big sister Karen comes to see us every week."

"Big sister Annie is with us every day."

<b>

The twins earnestly explained the current situation to Cordelia. Throughout, Cordelia nodded along, saying, "Yes, yes, I see? Yes," while listening intently to their clumsy words.

<b>

<b>

Kneeling down with tears in her eyes, Cordelia embraced the two toddlers, sharing gentle smiles and words.

<b>

Catherine watched this scene, as if a beam of light from above was shining down on them, covering her face with her hands as she peeked through.

Then, trembling slightly, she muttered, "Gah! So precious! Cordelia is truly a saint?! Are we witnessing a miracle right now?!" as if she were about to cough up blood.

<b>

No, she was actually about to cough up blood, Lucille thought, casting a cold glance at her cousin. And while thinking, "If you’re going to revere her, at least tone it down a bit in your everyday behavior," she also recalled, "Ah, now that I think about it, teasing her and then revering her is this child's enjoyment," and decided to ignore her strange behavior once again.
