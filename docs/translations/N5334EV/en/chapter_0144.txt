# 132 - The Saint of Blonde Rolls

When Cordelia and the others turned around, they were confronted by a gaze that looked up at them from somewhat lower than their own eyes.

<blank>

The owner of the gaze seems to be peeking at them, but he is watching them without caution.

They were dressed in uniforms of the same design as their own, with pochettes slung over their shoulders and even a small but obi sword.

And his eyes, while still young, show a strong will.

<blank>

Oh, my! We're waiting for our friends here!"

<blank>

It was Cordelia who immediately reacted as soon as she realized that they were her juniors.

Her pomposity is considerable, but so is her skill at mending in response to the public eye.

<blank>

I wonder if you are from the Elementary School? Hi, how are you? I'm Cordelia Casper, a first-year student in the secondary school.

My name is Annie Cloud and I am attending the elementary school this year. I would like to ask for your kind cooperation.

<blank>

Catherine mutters, "It's quintessential," to Cordelia, who quickly makes a supercilious remark.

Lucille stares in admiration at Annie, who responds to Cordelia in a firm manner.

<blank>

Staring at the pretty curtesy, Lucille wonders if? I think.

<blank>

Good day to you, Mr. Cloud. I am Lucille Moore. Are you, by any chance, a relative of Miss Suzy Cloud?"

Do you know my sister Susie?"

Yes, I am aware of that.

Really? So you are Mr. Cloud's sister? You certainly seem to have the same air about you. ......"

Yes, no, I am your sister Suzy's cousin. ...... I am! She's always been very sweet to me!"

<blank>

The mention of the name of a mutual acquaintance on both sides loosens the slight tension that existed between them.

<blank>

Cordelia stares at Annie with a slight upturn in her cheeks, "Maybe I can get closer to Master Cloud," having met a lovely junior in such a place.

<blank>

Annie, on the other hand, asked with a moderately calm judgment, "For a friend of your sister Suzy's, she might be a little different type .......

<blank>

When you say your friend is waiting for you, do you mean your sister Suzy?

"...... Oh, no, it's your other friend who is waiting for you ....... I'm a classmate of yours. ......"

<blank>

Annie looks up curiously at Cordelia's stuttering face.

<blank>

But then, the door to the building was opened with a loud bang from inside, and everyone's attention was drawn in that direction.

<blank>

I looked toward the building and saw two small shadows coming out of the open door.

<blank>

Annie, baby girl!

Hey, girl!

<blank>

Dan! Nan! What's wrong? You have to be inside!"

"Because I saw Annie, the little girl."

Also, others can be found at ......."

<blank>

The twins together cling to Annie.

They said that Annie noticed that they were outside and rushed out to see if there was anyone suspicious again.

<blank>

...... did you just say Dan?" What did you say?"

<blank>

As soon as Cordilia heard their names, her eyes widened and she put her hand over her mouth.

<blank>

There really were those two! And they are so big!

<blank>

The last time Cordilia saw them was three years ago.

I believe it was only three at the time.

Although she is unsure if she remembers herself, Cordelia has known them since they were babies.

<blank>

The newborn twins were so adorable that Karen and I remember holding onto their cribs, both of us agitated by the slightest movement of the sleeping babies.

<blank>

Dan! Nan! Don't you remember me? I'm Cordelia! Me! It's Cody!"

<blank>

Cordelia shouts at the twins as if she were impressed, but they just look up at her with a scowling face as they hold on to Annie.

<blank>

Do you know him?"

Hmm?

"Ko-dee?"

<blank>

When Annie asked, the twins still stared at Cordelia curiously.

<blank>

"Don't you remember ......? Whenever I went to visit you at your mansion, the two of you always welcomed me with open arms?"

<blank>

Cordelia kneels on the spot and spreads her arms out to make eye contact with the twins.

Seeing Cordelia, the twins slowly move away from Annie and toward Cordelia.

Then she began to stare hard at the neatly curled blonde hair that hung down the sides of Cordilia's face, her little eyes wide.

<blank>

As Annie and the others watched, the twins now gently touched Cordelia's hair with their tiny hands, twirling their fingers in the curly blonde locks as if to caress and check. And then .......

<blank>

Aaagh!

<blank>

Together, they began ruthlessly pulling at Cordilia's blonde rolls with all the force of an infant.

<blank>

Kocha?"

Koacha!"

Yes, yes! I'm Ko-chan! I'm Kochan, you know! Ouch, ouch! It hurts!"

<blank>

The twins clung to Cordelia, each pulling her hair from side to side and smiling happily.

<blank>

Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You guys! Stop pulling my hair like that every time you see me. ...... Ouch! Oh, God! I'll tell Karen again!

<blank>

Cordelia's words sound angry, but her face is happy. She puts her arms around the twins, who are close to her, calling out, "Koacha, Koacha! She turns her arms around the twins, who call out "Koacha!" and bring their faces together, and hugs them as they are.

<blank>

I'm glad to see ...... that it's so big. It's really grown up so much. ...... Are you eating well? Is your bed not too hard? Are you cold?"

"...... are you okay, Koacha?"

Everyone is nice to me, so I don't mind."

<blank>

Cordilia hugs the twins, gently rubbing her cheek against their faces and quietly speaking to them.

<blank>

"............ I see. If you're having a hard time, just tell me, okay?"

I'm fine. Karen, my big girl, is coming every week."

Annie and I are together every day.

<blank>

The two do their best to explain the current situation to Cordilia. Cordilia was listening hard to their poor words as they began and ended with "Yes, yes, yes, is that so? Yes," and listened hard to their poor words.

<blank>

<blank>

Kneeling down, eyes moistening, Cordilia hugs the two toddlers and talks to them with a gentle smile.

<blank>

Catherine peeked at the scene, dazzlingly covering her face with her hands, as if there was a light from the heavens shining only there.

Then he pulled his body and gave a small tremble and said, "Gosh! Toutoku! You're so precious! Cordelia-sama, are you really a saint? We are now! Did we just witness a miracle? She is muttering to herself, coughing as if she were vomiting blood.

<blank>

No, this is actually vomiting blood. Lucille looks at her cousin sideways with cold eyes. And then she thinks, "If she's going to be so respectful, why doesn't she just be a little less rude?" But then she thinks, "Oh, by the way, it's her pleasure to play with me and then respect me," and decides to pretend once again that she doesn't see the odd behavior.
