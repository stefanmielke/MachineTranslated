# Chapter 185: The Rematch with Arvin Haggard!

A little before Lawrence unleashed his wicked magic indoors.

<b>

<b>

In the courtyard, Arvin unleashed his fighting spirit towards the swaying shadow at the corner of the surrounding wall without hesitation.

However, the opponent seemed to absorb it as if it were merely a breeze, showing no sign of movement.

<b>

This reaction was familiar. No doubt about it.

<b>

Arvin flicked the snap buckle on his chest with his left hand and unfastened the belt holding his two-handed sword at his back.

He caught the grip of the two-handed sword as it was about to fall from his back with his right hand, and with his left hand, which he quickly moved behind him, he drew the sword from its sheath and discarded it onto the cobblestone ground.

Then, as if to confirm the weight of the sword, he swung the tip widely to the right, stopped it aimed at his opponent, and quietly lowered his stance.

<b>

"Well, we meet again."

<b>

Holding the two-handed sword with both hands, Arvin spoke while provocatively rotating the tip of the blade.

<b>

"Now then? Have we met somewhere before?"

<b>

The figure that formed from the shadow stepped forward to respond.

<b>

"Don't play dumb. This awful smell is not something you easily forget."

<b>

"Smell... you say? Unfortunately, I have no recollection of acquaintances like dogs or cats."

<b>

"The stench is worse than before, isn't it? Even if it's not a dog or cat, it could make anyone's nose curl."

<b>

"That's troubling... Are you saying that conversation is impossible with someone who knows nothing of manners?"

<b>

"That's a conversation for humans, right? It's unnecessary with lowly monsters, isn't it?"

<b>

"That's quite revealing of your background. To call a stranger a non-human on a first meeting... How barbaric you must be to come down from the mountains."

<b>

"We're not strangers, and I'm not human. Are you stalling for time with this pointless conversation? I won't let you escape like last time."

<b>

"Well, I don't recall escaping..."

<b>

Before that sentence could finish, Arvin's body crumbled forward as if he were gently collapsing. He immediately closed the distance and swiftly slashed upward from the right with his two-handed sword.

However, the opponent merely leaned slightly and effortlessly dodged the blade's trajectory.

<b>

Arvin closed the distance further and brought the sword down after reversing its direction above.

Once again, the opponent shifted their body to the side and easily avoided the attack.

<b>

"What's the matter? Is your sword too big? If you're being swung around by it, you won't hit your opponent at all."

<b>

"Shut up!"

<b>

As Arvin continued to unleash a series of slashes, the opponent sneered and threw words back at him.

<b>

But suddenly, the shadow's body was blown sideways.

<b>

"Arvin! What are you dawdling for!"

"Ugh! Alicia?!"

<b>

Alicia hit the side of the shadow with a silent flying kick.

<b>

"Good grief, it seems there are only rude people here."

<b>

The opponent, who should have been blown away, spoke from behind Alicia.

Without turning to the direction of the voice, Alicia instantly delivered a spinning kick to where the head should be.

However, the shadow merely tilted its neck and lightly dodged.

Yet, as Alicia was turning her body, in the next moment, she struck the opponent's temple with her other leg.

<b>

Even a basic kick has the power to easily send a small ogre flying.

Moreover, the leg delivering the kick was equipped with combat boots covered in iron plates. The soles were metallic, and the knee and heel parts had thick, sharp spikes, making the boots themselves a deadly weapon.

Even so, the opponent's body did not budge. It felt as if she had kicked a thick log.

<b>

Alicia, as if this was within her expectations, continued to twist her body and deliver more kicks.

<b>

However, the series of kicks she was delivering suddenly stopped right in front of the shadow.

<b>

The shadow had raised its hand to about its face level.

The fingertips of its claws extended like a dagger, reflecting black light, blocking Alicia's kick.

<b>

With a light flick of its hand, the shadow deflected Alicia's leg, sending it flying backward with great force.

<b>

Alicia placed her hands on the ground and extended her legs, spinning like a top while dissipating the momentum from being deflected.

<b>

<b>

As Alicia was sent flying, Arvin swung his two-handed sword horizontally towards the shadow.

The shadow caught it with its claws.

A sharp metallic sound echoed as metal clashed.

<b>

Arvin then wrapped the claws with his sword and flicked them upward, immediately bringing the tip of his sword down towards the opponent's neck.

However, once again, a metallic sound rang out as the two-handed sword was deflected by the other claw.

<b>

"Hmm, you could afford to increase your speed a bit more."

<b>

"Is that so?"

<b>

A smirk appeared on Arvin's lips, and the control gem on his leather armor faintly glowed.

The magical sigils engraved on his equipment filled with magical power and shone, as the amber wolf eyes glimmered with a golden light.

<b>

The shadow could not see Arvin's advance.

The flash of the sword raced through the shadow, as if to tear it apart.

<b>

By the time it noticed, the right arm it had used for defense was gone.

The arm, severed precisely between the wrist and elbow, spun in the air.

<b>

"This is surprising. That was truly impressive."

<b>

The shadow opened its eyes wide in genuine surprise, praising Arvin.

At the same time, several streams of blood dripped from the severed arm's wound, rising like a snake raising its head, connecting with the wound of the severed arm.

<b>

The streams of blood pulsed like a living creature, drawing the severed arm closer, and the wounds merged together.

The combined wound swelled as if bubbling, and in no time, it returned to its original single arm.

<b>

"â€¦So, you're definitely not human."

<b>

Arvin muttered to himself, still holding his stance, recalling that he had seen something like this recently.

<b>

"Arvin, get back!"

<b>

Alicia's sudden shout echoed from behind.

<b>

The moment Alicia's voice rang out, Arvin sensed a murderous intent descending from directly above him.

Almost simultaneously with the shout, Arvin kicked the ground and reflexively leaped backward.

<b>

Just after Arvin jumped, a black figure fell from above, precisely where he had been standing.

<b>

It was cloaked in black, showing a feral grin with teeth like a carnivorous beast.

It plunged the dagger it held straight into the ground with both hands and shouted.

<b>

"Take this! 'Dust Technique'!!"

<b>

In an instant, magical power surged as if the ground beneath its feet were splitting.

<b>

"Ugh! Carla! You idiot!!"

<b>

Alicia's panicked shout was drowned out as, like there was gunpowder buried underground, thick pillars of fire erupted in succession with a loud bang.

<b>

The pillars of flame roared and shook the ground, engulfing the area along with the black-clad Carla Edgarla and the shadow.
