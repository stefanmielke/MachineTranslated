# 185 - Irving Haggard Rematches!

Shortly before Lawrence unleashed his vicious magic indoors.

<blank>

<blank>

Irving, who was in the courtyard, unceremoniously slammed his fighting spirit against the shadows that swayed at the corners of the wall that surrounded it.

However, the opponent may have perceived it as a slight breeze, and did not show the slightest movement.

<blank>

I remember this reaction. No doubt.

<blank>

Irving flicks the snap buckle on his chest with the fingers of his left hand and unbuckles the belt of his two-handed sword that was strapped to his back.

He caught the grip of the two-handed sword as it was about to fall from his back with his right hand, unsheathed it with his left hand that was immediately behind his back, and then launched it directly onto the cobblestones.

He then turned the tip of the sword wide on the right side as if to check the weight of the sword, stopped it facing the opponent, and quietly sat back down.

<blank>

Hey, good to see you again."

<blank>

Irving points his two-handed sword and turns its tip in a provocative manner.

<blank>

"Well? Have I seen you anywhere?"

<blank>

The one who showed himself as a shadow takes shape steps forward and answers.

<blank>

Don't be silly. This stench is not something you can forget.

<blank>

Is it the stinkin' ......? I'm sorry, but I don't recall knowing anyone like a cat or dog?"

<blank>

I can't believe the smell is worse than it was the last time. Even if it wasn't a cat or a dog, my nose would still be turned.

<blank>

I'm at a loss. ...... You mean to tell me you can't even have a conversation with someone who doesn't know the concept of courtesy?"

<blank>

"That's for humans, isn't it? What's the need for a lowly demon?"

<blank>

It's called "knowing your country," isn't it? How can you call someone you've never met a person before an outsider? ...... How barbaric did you come down from the mountain?"

<blank>

It's not our first meeting, it's not a person. Are you wasting time with me or something? I'm not running away from you today like I did the other day."

<blank>

Now, I don't remember running away. ......

<blank>

Before he could finish his words, Irving's body collapsed forward as if he were falling down with a yuri. He then moved in for a pause with a single breath, and instantly slashed up with his two-handed sword from the lower right corner.

The opponent, however, turns his body slightly, and the sword is easily avoided.

<blank>

Irving slashed down with the tip of his sword, which he cut back upward, while closing the gap further.

The opponent also shifted his body by half a body length and avoided it without difficulty.

<blank>

What's wrong? You are using too big a sword, aren't you? If you are swinging your sword around, you will never be able to hit your opponent.

<blank>

Get out of here!"

<blank>

Irving, who repeatedly slashes without pause, throws words at his opponent as if sneering at him.

<blank>

But the shadow's body was suddenly blown sideways.

<blank>

Irving! What the hell are you doing?

'Oooh! Alicia?

<blank>

Alicia hit a flying kick soundlessly to the side of that shadow.

<blank>

Goodness gracious, it seems we have a bunch of people with no manners here.

<blank>

The other person, who was supposed to be blown away, speaks from behind Alicia.

Alicia didn't even look in the direction of the voice, but instantly sent a backward kick to where its head was.

The shadow, however, lightly ducks it by turning its head.

However, Alicia, who was turning her body, next moment slammed a kick into her opponent's side of the head with her other leg.

<blank>

Even a simple kick has the power to lightly blow away a small ogre.

The leg that kicks is equipped with armored combat boots covered with steel plates. The soles of the boots are made of metal, and the knees and heels have thick, sharp spikes.

Yet, the opponent's body did not even twitch. It was as if he had kicked a very thick log.

<blank>

Alicia never stopped moving, as if she knew this was coming, and continued to twist her body around and kick.

<blank>

However, the kick, which had been continuously slammed into him, stopped just in front of the shadow.

<blank>

A shadow raised its hand up to its own face area.

The fingertip claws extended long like daggers, reflecting black light and blocking Alicia's kick.

<blank>

As it was, the shadow lightly brushed off the hand, and Alicia's leg was played, sending her flying backward with great force.

<blank>

Alicia puts her hands on the ground, stretches out her legs, and spins around like a spinning top to kill the momentum of the bullet.

<blank>

<blank>

As soon as Alicia was played, Irving swung his two-handed sword sideways at the shadow.

The shadow catches it too with its own claws.

The high pitched sound of metal striking metal echoed around the area.

<blank>

Irving wraps his claws around his sword, leaps upward, and drops the tip of his sword into his opponent's neck.

But again, with a metallic clang, the two-handed sword was bounced off the other claw.

<blank>

Hm, I could speed things up a bit."

<blank>

"The meeting."

<blank>

Irving's mouth rises gruffly, and the control beads on the leather armor he wears light up faintly.

The magic seal engraved on the equipment was filled with magic power and emitted light, and the umber Wolf Eyes were tinged with a golden light.

<blank>

The shadow could not see Irving's steps.

A flash of swordlight runs instantly to split the shadows.

<blank>

I noticed that my right arm, which I was using to guard myself, was flying.

The arm, severed exactly midway between the wrist and elbow, spins in the air.

<blank>

This is amazing. Now that is really impressive."

<blank>

The shadow praised Irving with eyes wide open, as if genuinely surprised.

At the same time, several drops of blood dripped from the wounds on the cut arm, and like a serpent flailing its sickle, it grew up and connected with the wounds on the arms that had been sent flying.

<blank>

As the streaks of blood pulsed like a living creature, the flying arms were drawn together, their wounds meeting each other.

The combined wounds rose like bubbles, and before I could see them, they had reverted back to a single arm.

<blank>

"I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.

<blank>

Well, I just saw this guy recently ....... I've seen this guy recently," Irving, still unprepared, muses to himself.

<blank>

Irving, get back!"

<blank>

Alicia's cry sounded abruptly from behind her.

<blank>

The moment Alicia's voice rang out, Irving sensed a deadly force that seemed to thrust itself directly above him.

Irving kicked the ground almost as soon as his voice was raised and reflexively jumped backward.

<blank>

Immediately after Irving flew, a black figure fell from above to the exact spot where he had just been standing.

<blank>

It is dressed in black and smiles ferociously, showing its teeth like a predator.

He thrust the dagger in his hand straight down to the ground with both hands and shouted.

<blank>

I'll give you that! The Art of the Minutiae!"

<blank>

A moment later, the magic runs as if its feet are ripped apart.

<blank>

Oh wow! Kara! You idiot!

<blank>

Alicia's impatient cries were drowned out, and as if gunpowder had been planted in the ground, a thick column of fire rose up on the spot in rapid succession, making an explosive sound.

<blank>

The pillar of flame roared and shook the ground, enveloping the entire area, along with the black-clad Cara Edgarra and her shadow.
