# 119 A small commotion in the magic class

"Oh, Princess of AMCAM! We've been waiting for you.

<blank>

As I entered the magic testing hall, a voice without such a trace of tension stopped me.

Dr. Joseline Joslan.

<blank>

This half-elven teacher was in charge of the magic department we had just come from.

But they said they were waiting for something or other.

<blank>

No, more importantly, I heard something about freshmen having a mock battle, is that okay? I asked him. He said, "There are one or two sharp kids a year. The teacher says it's like a regular event in a way, so there should be no problem .......

<blank>

"Well...the professors said that even if something happens...if you throw the princess of AMCAM at her...she'll take care of it..."

<blank>

What are you saying to me, those three demo doctors and this goofy assistant teacher?

What in the world is their perception of me?

I feel like questioning them for a little more than an hour!

<blank>

I'm suddenly feeling a disturbing cloud over me! Is a mock battle really that serious?

<blank>

"No, I'm a new student, and I can't use such a big thing..."

<blank>

Dr. Joseline says that at the freshman level, it won't be a big deal, since they are only able to shoot out basic magic.

The magic that was unleashed by the students at the time of the entrance examinations keeps coming to my mind.

<blank>

Narwhal, if it's just like that, there's nothing to worry about. ......

Either way, I was going to let them do something close to that and get an idea of what I'm capable of now, so it's just as well or something. ......

<blank>

But I heard something about a mock battle being 3 to 1. ...... That's still disturbing, isn't it?

<blank>

<blank>

While I was worrying like this on my own, students who were going to have a mock battle soon entered the center of the testing hall in a hurry.

<blank>

It was Miss Lurie Diet and her cronies who came.

<blank>

Miss Lurie and her friends wear loose-fitting hooded robes over their uniforms.

It may be a piece of equipment for students of the Department of Magical Arts, as there are magical letters sewn into the cuffs and other parts of the cuffs with gold thread.

<blank>

But the teacher said something about a "sharp girl", so I guess it was as I thought, or how should I say it, it was Miss Lurie after all. ......

<blank>

So, I don't think the opponent is .......

<blank>

No way, Karen. ......

<blank>

Next to me, Ms. Cordelia uttered a small murmur. Her voice was so small that it would normally be inaudible.

Cordelia must be somewhat aware of the situation of her classmates, Karen and Ruly, as well.

<blank>

But seeing Miss Cordelia worried about Karen like this reminds me once again that I was not mistaken in my judgment that this girl is actually a kind girl.

<blank>

However, Miss Cordilia's concerns are unwarranted.

<blank>

"...... Su, Su-chan!"

<blank>

I was in the middle of a crowd of students who had gathered to watch a mock battle, and Karen had spotted me and was coming toward me.

Miss Cordelia noticed this, and although her eyes widened for a moment, she immediately let out a small sigh of relief.

<blank>

I'm sorry, Sue! I, I, it's my fault. ......"

Calm down, Karen. What's going on, huh?"

<blank>

Karen reached for my arms as if clinging to me and said something like that to me quickly.

Karen looks flustered, and I put my hand on her back to help her calm down a little.

For now, let's just ask her to tell us what happened. If we choose our words slowly, Karen will calm down soon.

<blank>

<blank>

Just then, a small commotion was heard from the students who had gathered to watch the mock battle.

Miss Lurie and her opponents had entered the proving ground.

<blank>

The opponent advances through the field with a calm, unruffled gait and steps out in front of his opponents.

<blank>

There was our Mia, standing quietly.

<blank>

A sigh of "oh" escapes the students who have gathered to watch the event.

Mainly from boys!

<blank>

Well, I don't know about that! Mia's sole is filled with dreams! Even though it is covered by a thick robe, its overwhelming mass is still there! Even though it is covered by a thick robe, its overwhelming mass asserts its presence!

But men! I will not allow you to look at it any more rudely than you have to! Huw!

<blank>

Mia is tall and stylish from the start, and in a situation like this on stage, her magnificent figure stands out even more.

<blank>

In fact, it is not only the boys who are watching. A number of female students seem to be letting out an involuntary sigh.

As for the robes she wears, I can't shake the feeling that Miss Lurie and the others are made to wear them, but Mia wears them well and is very good looking. She has long arms and legs, after all.

<blank>

<blank>

But Karen's hand gripping my clothes tightens, as if she still feels uneasy at the sight of Mia with such a presence.

<blank>

According to Karen, she had the misfortune to run into Miss Lurie and her friends as she was entering the magic department's classroom.

Miss Lurie started cursing Karen as if she was venting her frustration, and then Mia intervened.

<blank>

There was some questioning and answering, but it was interrupted when the assistant teacher in charge of the magic department came to the classroom.

However, after the teacher finished explaining the class in the classroom, Miss Lurie asked the teacher for permission to have a mock battle with Mia.

<blank>

What is she doing, Miss Lurie?

The teacher who allows it is also a teacher! Totally.

<blank>

When I was giving Dr. Joseline the eye, she turned around and smiled at me.

<blank>

Then... if there's anything I can do to help... please do..."

Wait!

<blank>

With such a dismissive remark, the teacher waded through the students and proceeded with light steps to the center of the testing hall.

Woohoo! What a person!

<blank>

Now that we are both ready to go, let's get started.

<blank>

The time is 3 minutes. During that time, if your magic power runs out, or if you can no longer use magic, it will be over.

<blank>

Please tell me if you want to give up early. There is also a referee's stoppage.

<blank>

The assistant teacher explains the precautions of the mock battle in a voice that is still tension-free.

I wonder if he will continue to serve as a referee as well.

<blank>

The robes worn by Mia and Miss Lurie are said to have anti-magic properties. It is said that it is given to suppress the power of the received magic.

The doctor says this will reduce the magic damage a lot.

<blank>

If you look closely, you can see that each of Miss Lurie and her friends is holding a cane about 30 centimeters long in their hands.

It is somewhat thicker and more ornate than the one I used when I first tried activating the magic barrier here on the day I carved the spirit seal. According to the teacher, this is a piece of equipment for the students of the magic department.

<blank>

Mistress Lurie glared at Mia and flicked her cane against one palm as if she were handling a teaching stick.

<blank>

But vs. Mia, I'm empty-handed. How's that for a handicap ......?

<blank>

Hey Sue. Mia, that's ......."

Uh-huh.

<blank>

Bibi poked me gently and whispered anxiously in a hushed voice, "I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this.

Yeah, I know. I'm a little worried too, you know?

<blank>

Now... let's begin... please...

<blank>

Our worries were not taken into consideration as Dr. Joseline announced in a loud voice that the mock battle was about to begin.
