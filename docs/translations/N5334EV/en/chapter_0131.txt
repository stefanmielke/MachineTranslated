# Chapter 119: A Little Commotion in the Magic Class

“Heyyy, Princess Amukamu! We’ve been waiting for youuu!”

<b>

As I entered the magic training ground, a voice devoid of any tension called out to me.

It was Professor Joslyn Joslan.

<b>

This half-elf teacher is said to be in charge of the magic department we have just arrived at.

But what did she mean by saying she was waiting for me? 

<b>

No, more importantly, I heard something about new students having mock battles. Is that really okay? When I asked, the professor said that every year there are one or two sharp kids. It’s somewhat of a tradition, so there shouldn’t be any problems… 

<b>

“Well, even if something happens, if we just throw it at Princess Amukamu, the professors said she would somehow handle it.”

<b>

Whaaaat are those outrageous three professors and this scatterbrained assistant teacher saying about me?!!

What on earth is their perception of me?!

I feel like I want to interrogate them for about an hour!

<b>

By the way, I suddenly sensed an ominous atmosphere! Are mock battles really that serious?!

<b>

“No, new students can’t use anything that grand.”

<b>

According to Professor Joslyn, at the new student level, casting basic magic is about the extent of it, so it shouldn’t be a big deal.

The magic the examinees cast during the entrance exam flashes through my mind.

<b>

I see, if it’s at that level, there’s no need to worry…

In any case, I was planning to let them do something similar to gauge their current abilities, so it’s just right or something…

<b>

But I heard something about a 3-on-1 mock battle… Isn’t that still ominous?

<b>

<b>

As I was worrying about this, soon enough, the students who were going to have the mock battle started to trickle into the center of the training ground.

<b>

The ones who arrived were Lady RuuRii Diet and her entourage.

<b>

Lady RuuRii and her friends were wearing loose-fitting hooded robes over their uniforms.

The cuffs and such were embroidered with golden threads and magical letters, so they might be student equipment for the magic department.

<b>

But since the professor referred to them as “sharp kids,” it seems I was right; it really is Lady RuuRii…

<b>

Does that mean the opponent is…?

<b>

“Could it be, Karen…”

<b>

Lady Cordelia, next to me, murmured softly. It was such a quiet voice that it would normally be inaudible.

It seems Lady Cordelia is somewhat aware of the situation between her classmate Karen and Lady RuuRii.

<b>

However, seeing Lady Cordelia worry about Karen like this makes me reaffirm that my judgment that she is actually a kind person was not wrong.

<b>

But Lady Cordelia’s worries are unfounded.

<b>

“...S-Suu-chan!”

<b>

Because Karen, having pushed her way through the students gathered to watch the mock battle, was coming toward me.

Noticing this, Lady Cordelia widened her eyes for a moment but soon sighed softly in relief.

<b>

“I-I’m sorry, Suu-chan! It’s all my fault…”

“Calm down, Karen. What happened?”

<b>

Reaching out to cling to my arms, Karen spoke rapidly.

I placed a hand on her back to help her calm down a bit.

For now, let’s just find out what happened. If I take my time choosing my words, Karen should settle down soon.

<b>

<b>

Just then, the students gathered to watch the mock battle began to murmur softly.

The opponents of Lady RuuRii had entered the training ground.

<b>

The opponent walked in with a calm, unhurried gait and stepped forward in front of the contestants.

<b>

There stood our Mia, quietly waiting.

<b>

A sigh of admiration escaped from the students gathered to watch, primarily from the boys!

<b>

Well, I can’t blame them! Mia is filled with dreams! Even covered by a thick robe, her overwhelming presence asserts itself!

But boys! I won’t allow any disrespectful gazes toward her! No way!!

<b>

Mia is tall and has a good figure, so in a situation like this, her splendid appearance stands out even more.

<b>

In fact, it’s not just the boys who are captivated. Several girls seem to be letting out sighs without realizing it.

While Lady RuuRii and her friends seem to wear their robes with a sense of being dressed up, Mia wears hers stylishly and looks cool. Her long limbs certainly help.

<b>

<b>

However, even seeing Mia’s impressive presence, Karen seems to still feel anxious, gripping my clothes tightly.

<b>

According to Karen, she happened to run into Lady RuuRii and her friends just as she was entering the magic classroom.

It seems Lady RuuRii started to insult Karen as if to vent her frustrations, but then Mia intervened.

<b>

There was some back-and-forth, but it was temporarily interrupted when the assistant teacher in charge of the magic department arrived in the classroom.

However, after the class explanation from the teacher was over, Lady RuuRii asked the teacher for permission to have a mock battle with Mia.

<b>

What on earth is Lady RuuRii doing?

The teacher who granted permission is also something else! Seriously.

<b>

As I shot a sidelong glance at Professor Joslyn, she turned to me and smiled.

<b>

“Well then, if anything happens, please take care of it.”

“Whaat?!!”

<b>

Leaving that parting remark, the professor made her way through the students toward the center of the training ground with a light step.

Oh my gosh! What a person!!

<b>

“Alright then, it seems both sides are ready, so let’s get started!”

<b>

“The time limit is three minutes. If your magic runs out or you can’t use magic during that time, it will be over.”

<b>

“Please call out for a surrender early. There will also be a referee stop.”

<b>

With her usual nonchalant voice, the assistant teacher explained the rules of the mock battle.

I guess she’ll also serve as the referee.

<b>

Hmm, it seems the robes that Mia and Lady RuuRii are wearing have anti-magic effects. They are said to suppress the power of the magic received.

The professor mentioned that this would significantly reduce magical damage.

<b>

Upon closer inspection, Lady RuuRii and her friends each held wands about 30 centimeters long.

They seem thicker and somewhat more decorated than the ones used when I first tried to activate a magic barrier here on the day of the spirit seal. According to the professor, these are student supplies for the magic department.

<b>

Lady RuuRii glared at Mia while tapping her wand against her palm like a teacher wielding a pointer.

<b>

But Mia is empty-handed. How does that handicap work…?

<b>

“Hey, Suu. Mia is…”

“Y-Yeah.”

<b>

Bibi gently nudged me and whispered anxiously.

Yeah, I get it. I’m a bit worried too.

<b>

“Well then, let’s get started!”

<b>

Ignoring our worries, Professor Joslyn announced the start of the mock battle in a loud voice.
