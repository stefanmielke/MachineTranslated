# 172 - The Afternoon of an Abduction Day

Ceilings are not very high.

The walls are made of musty stone. The humidity is great.

Surrounded on all sides by moss-covered stone walls, it is devoid of any decoration or furniture.

The size is like 3 meters by 3 meters. It's about the size of a four-and-a-half tatami mat.

The one door is made of iron without even a peephole and is badly rusted red.

Everything around it has deteriorated so badly over time that it seems to have been built before the Middle Ages.

And on the floor, there is only a single dull blanket, which is a mercy.

It's not very big, but it's not big enough to squeeze more than one person in.

<blank>

Where is this place? It's a dingy basement somewhere.

<blank>

Well, it was in the basement of a building right next to the hotel where we were staying.

The fact that the attackers easily broke into the hotel last night, and that there is a bandit hideout so close to the hotel, one would think that someone on the hotel side must be in on it. I can't help but wonder if someone on the hotel side is in on it.

Well, Rudri and his team fought them off quickly and easily.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The room is now surprisingly bright.

The light is coming in through a light window that touches the ceiling.

<blank>

............ lighted windows?

<blank>

That's actually a vent under the floor or something, isn't it?

It also has thin steel grating.

<blank>

A small gray animal peeks out from it and makes a "choo-choo" sound.

I bet that lower frame area is the same height as the ground, right?

I can even see what looks like a weed growing in little patches.

The stain-like growths on the stone wall that hang down from both sides of the frame, is it moss?

<blank>

After all, water comes in here, right?

No wonder it's damp and moldy.

<blank>

On the floor below the wall is a trench about a brick wide.

This trench seems to continue beyond the walls on both sides.

Is this a drain?

<blank>

There is churning water in the ditch, and the wall surface in the water can be seen to be severely slick.

And it smells very doughy.

<blank>

This is connected to the sewage system, after all.

<blank>

With such narrow gutters, can they handle it if it rains or something?

<blank>

Well, this area is not a rainy area, and there are no big rivers nearby.

I wonder if they don't get flooded that often?

<blank>

However, upon closer inspection of the surrounding walls, there appears to be a single horizontal line at a height about my height.

The color of the wall appears to be slightly different at the top and bottom after this point. ......

Could this possibly be the trace of water that has accumulated up to this point?

<blank>

Sewer water overflows to this point? Stop it, it's horrifying.

<blank>

<blank>

So, why am I here?

This is because I am currently being kidnapped!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Let's take the story back a bit to last night's dinner.

<blank>

After restraining all those who were running riot in the bar, Mr. Roderick gave the owner of the bar a rather large amount of money for food and drink and a tip, and told him to hand them over to the guards, and then left the bar.

<blank>

At the inn, we gathered in Roderick's room to discuss the future.

Algernon, who had been chasing the guy who threw the dagger, was back there, too, and he shared the information he had acquired.

<blank>

<blank>

-- was still a rank 5 bouncer--.

--You can't take on this army in a small room...

--Then just attack them as they're leaving town.

--There are several places to raid as far as Lien Canal. Send word to the guys on standby.

--What do you do when you attack a small group of five or ten people? You saw the bar. We're going to get them back.

--Then let the soldiers pack up and attack--

--And yet, the people on the street are not enough at all.

--And I'm informed that he will be leading a convoy tomorrow. Even if we hit them properly, the men on the street right now will be wiped out.

--Gather the troops.

--The only way we can do better than this is if we have a lot more strength than this by the end of the night. It will take all of tomorrow to get this thing up and running.

-- "After all, isn't it best to strike while you're in town? --

And they failed to do so--and they failed to do so--and they failed to do so.

--How about holding the daughter you have with you hostage--

--I don't see anything about him having a daughter.

-with a dedicated escort. There is no doubt that they are related--

--The information has not been corroborated, but there is information that seems to be circulating...

--You can be sure what kind of people are involved when you get them--you can be sure of that when you get them.

<blank>

<blank>

Well, it seems that an exchange like this was said at some hideout of the attackers.

It seems that it was actually the rats inhabiting the hideout who heard this story, and Bibi, who is connected to Algernon, who sympathizes with them, interpreted it and told it to them.

<blank>

This is the conversation Bibi picked up from Algernon after Algernon tracked the assailant I found and the conversation at what appeared to be his hideout.

Like ...... translations of translations of translations anymore?

<blank>

As soon as Algernon arrived in Hexagom, he was running all over the place and sympathizing with all the small animals in town.

To be frank, in a city like this, if Bibi and Algernon were so inclined, the secret information would be completely under glass!

<blank>

Nope! Same level as the diary in my brother's room!

I can expose everything with one hand! said sister Carla of the Edgarra family before with a high laugh.

I'm sorry for your loss, Alan. But I don't feel sorry for you. The dark book of black history that accumulates perverted words and actions on a daily basis should be purified under the clean sun!

<blank>

...... Oops, I went off on a completely unrelated tangent. Let's get back on track.

<blank>

It looks like things are going pretty much the way we want them to! Bibi said.

<blank>

They can be summarized at .......

I would like to do something about Mr. Roderick during this trip, but his escort is too strong!

Then why don't you kidnap the daughter-like girl you have with you and take her hostage?

It seems that tomorrow they will leave their daughter in this city and head to Lien Canal, so take her while they are there.

Even if it's not the real girl, that could be useful, so there's no harm in kidnapping her, right?

<blank>

The conversation seemed to have settled into something like this.

It seems like a very haphazard plan, but I guess Mr. Rudri is right, they are really short-sighted.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And the next morning.

As planned, Roderick led the convoy to Lien Canal.

The convoy numbered approximately 20 people!

<blank>

Whatever they are, they are personnel from a security company affiliated with the Northmilia Chamber of Commerce.

They had long been unhappy with the delay in applications for increased security in the Karnafraemer group and had been sending them to Hexagom, little by little.

The reason Roderick went to the branch as soon as he arrived in town yesterday was to check on these personnel.

<blank>

I heard that these guards are very well equipped and are as skilled as knights, not just guards.

That's why the thieves can't take any chances, can they?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After seeing them off, we decided to wander around the city.

I know I'm being followed, so I'm talking about creating an opening here.

<blank>

He makes a pretense of peeking into the storefront and wanders that way and that way. They are always looking for a way out.

<blank>

After having lunch at a suitable restaurant, I went to the back of the crowd to get away from Bibi and Mia, who were my guards.

Then, they wander off and into an alleyway, as if they were lost.

<blank>

Where are they? And where did they go?

The lines should not be barbed!

<blank>

Then, several suspicious figures attacked!

<blank>

Who are you people? What are you doing?

One of the daughters is quickly stuffed into a bag and carried away!

<blank>

And so the mission is complete.

<blank>

<blank>

But this is really the wacky one that got stuck in the Zuda bag!

It was extremely smelly and dusty, and I had a hard time holding in my sneezes!

Well, from the beginning? I'm in the role of bait, so I know I'm going to be treated roughly. ......

<blank>

But ......, the yarrow who stroked my dainty hips as he carried me around .......

I'm not going to let you get away with it. ...... I'm not going to let you get away with it!

<blank>

Originally, we had made a promise that we would not have to put up with them if they pressed us for something disreputable.

Still! I want you to praise me for putting up with it!

I guess I've grown up too. No, really!
