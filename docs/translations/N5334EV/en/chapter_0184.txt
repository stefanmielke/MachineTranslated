# Chapter 172: An Afternoon of Abduction

The ceiling isn't very high.

The walls are made of moldy stone. The humidity is intense.

Surrounded by moss-covered stone walls, there are no decorations or furniture at all.

It feels about 3 meters by 3 meters in size. Maybe around the size of a four-and-a-half tatami mat?

The only door is made of iron, rusted terribly, and has no peephole.

The aging around it is so severe that it seems to have been made before the Middle Ages.

And on the floor, there is just a single dull blanket laid out as a token gesture.

There's no way this space could accommodate multiple people.

<b>

If you’re wondering where this is, it’s a filthy underground room somewhere.

<b>

Well, it’s actually the basement of a building just a stone's throw from the hotel we were staying at.

Given that the attackers easily infiltrated the hotel last night, one can't help but suspect that someone on the hotel side is aware of the thieves' hideout being so close by.

Well, those guys were swiftly repelled by Mr. Rodrick, though.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The room is surprisingly bright right now.

Light is coming in through a window that is almost at the ceiling.

<b>

……Is that a light window?

<b>

Isn't it actually a ventilation opening under the floor?

It has a thin iron grate too.

<b>

A gray small animal peeks its face out from there, making a "chuu chuu" sound.

That lower frame is surely at the same height as the ground, right?

I can see something like weeds growing there too.

The stains that hang down from both sides of that frame extending to the stone wall—could they be moss?

<b>

This place must be letting water in, right?

It's only natural that it's damp and smells musty.

<b>

On the floor below the wall, there’s a groove about the width of a single brick.

This groove seems to continue beyond the walls on both sides.

Is this a drainage ditch?

<b>

Water is trickling through the groove, and I can tell that the wall surface in that water is terribly slimy.

And it smells very much like a sewer.

<b>

This is definitely connected to the sewage system.

<b>

Can such a narrow gutter handle rain if it falls?

<b>

Well, this area isn't particularly known for heavy rain, and there aren't any large rivers nearby.

So it probably doesn't suffer from flooding often?

<b>

However, upon closely observing the surrounding walls, it looks like there’s a horizontal line at about my height.

The color of the wall seems slightly different above and below this line...

Could this be a mark showing how high the water has risen?

<b>

Sewage overflowing to this level? Please, that’s chilling.

<b>

<b>

So, why am I in a place like this, you ask?

That’s because right now, I’m in the midst of being abducted!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Let’s rewind a bit to last night’s dinner.

<b>

After restraining all the ruffians causing trouble at the tavern, Mr. Rodrick handed over quite a hefty sum for food and tips to the tavern owner, instructing him to pass the ruffians to the guards before we left the tavern.

<b>

At the inn, we gathered in Mr. Rodrick’s room to discuss our future plans.

Algernon, who had been chasing after the one who threw the dagger, had also returned and shared the information he had gathered.

<b>

<b>

――It was indeed a Rank 5 bouncer――

――In a cramped room, our soldiers wouldn’t stand a chance――

――Then we should ambush them just outside the city――

――There are several ambush spots up to the Rien Canal. Let’s notify those waiting――

――What good is it to attack with just five or ten people? Did you see how the tavern turned out? They’d be counter-attacked――

――Then let’s gather the soldiers and attack all at once――

――Even so, the soldiers on the road aren’t nearly enough――

――Especially since tomorrow, we have information that they’ll be leading the escort. If we clash head-on, the soldiers on the road will be wiped out――

――Gather the soldiers――

――It’s impossible to surpass this fighting force tonight. No matter how you look at it, it’ll take all day tomorrow――

――Isn’t it best to attack while we’re still in the city?――

――That’s what we failed to do――

――What if we take the girl with him hostage?――

――There’s no information that he has a daughter――

――He has a dedicated escort. It’s certain he’s connected――

――We haven’t verified it, but there’s information that suggests so――

――We can find out what kind of connection it is after we abduct her――

<b>

<b>

So, this kind of exchange was apparently being discussed somewhere in the attackers' hideout.

The reason I say "apparently" is that the only ones who actually heard this conversation were the rats living in that hideout, and it was translated for us by Vibi, who empathized with Algernon.

<b>

This is the conversation that Algernon tracked down after I found the attackers, and Vibi picked it up from Algernon at what seemed to be their hideout.

It’s like a translation of a translation of a translation…?

<b>

As soon as Algernon arrived at Hexagom, he was running around everywhere, empathizing with the small animals in the city.

To be honest, in a city like this, if Vibi and Algernon decided to, they could make all hidden information completely transparent!

<b>

No! It’s on the same level as my brother’s diary!

I could expose everything with one hand! As Carla from the Edgarra family once laughed while saying.

Sorry, Alan. But I won’t sympathize with you. Your dark history of perverted actions accumulated over time should be purified under the clear sun!!

<b>

……Oops, I completely veered off topic. Let’s get back to it.

<b>

“Things seem to be progressing mostly as we hoped!” Vibi said.

<b>

To summarize their conversation…

They want to do something about Mr. Rodrick during this journey, but the escort is too strong and it’s dangerous!

So, wouldn’t it be good to kidnap the girl who seems to be with him and take her hostage?

Tomorrow, she’ll be left in this city while heading to the Rien Canal, so they should abduct her then.

Even if she’s not the real daughter, it could still be useful, so it wouldn’t hurt to kidnap her.

<b>

It seems the conversation settled down like that.

It feels like a rather haphazard plan, but as Mr. Rodrick said, they really are quite shortsighted.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Then the next morning.

As planned, Mr. Rodrick led the escort to the Rien Canal.

The number of escorts was about 20!

<b>

Apparently, they are personnel from a security company under the Northmilia Trading Company.

They had been gradually sending people to Hexagom, frustrated by the delays in the security reinforcement application for the Karnaflemer region.

Mr. Rodrick headed straight to the branch as soon as he arrived in the city yesterday to confirm this personnel.

<b>

These security personnel are quite well-equipped and boast a level of skill comparable to that of a knight order, not just guards.

No wonder the thieves wouldn’t dare to act recklessly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After seeing them off, we decided to wander around the city.

Knowing we were being followed, we thought we’d create an opening for them.

<b>

Feigning to peek into shop fronts, we strolled this way and that, showing a vulnerable appearance.

<b>

After having lunch at a random shop, I made my way deeper into the crowd, trying to separate myself from the escorts, Vibi and Mia.

Then, straying away, I entered an alley as if I were lost.

<b>

Where am I? Where did they go? I didn’t forget to show a worried expression.

My lines shouldn’t sound wooden!

<b>

Then, multiple suspicious figures approached!

<b>

Who are you?! What are you doing?!

I shouted, but in no time at all, one lady was stuffed into a bag and carried away!

<b>

And that’s how the mission was completed.

<b>

<b>

But really, I was shoved into a sack!

It was terribly smelly and dusty, and holding back a sneeze was quite a challenge!

Well, from the start? I knew I’d be treated roughly since I was meant to be bait…

<b>

But… the guy who groped my delicate little bottom while carrying me… 

I won’t forgive you… absolutely not!

<b>

Originally, I had a promise that I wouldn’t have to endure anything inappropriate.

Even so! I want to be praised for enduring it properly!

I think I’ve grown up. No, really!
