# Episode 139: Nighttime Cleanup

"Shut up, stop talking, you smell."

"Go-besh!!"

<b>

I opened my mouth, and as I was about to let out another stinky breath, I kicked him away.

His body flew through the air and shattered the door of the building he collided with.

Oh, he's moving. It's okay, he's still alive.

<b>

From the broken door, a swarm of filth came pouring out.

I launched a perfectly timed flick of my finger imbued with 'ki' towards them.

The shockwave wrapped in ki released from my fingertip blew away the filth one after another.

<b>

This is the seventh hideout.

It seems to be a place where there are girls too.

There aren't any girls as badly off as the ones at the first location, but for some reason, there are several who are in a 'cursed' state.

Hmm, just as planned, let's cleanly crush every one of these men here without letting a single one escape.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

The first place I stormed into was truly the worst kind of place.

It seemed that this establishment, which was not an ordinary brothel, primarily catered to special fetishes, and the horrific scenes were unbearable to witness.

<b>

A girl whose face was so swollen that her original features were unrecognizable.

A girl whose limbs were not in a normal shape.

A girl who continued to scream in a state of utter madness.

It was a place where acts that a normally living human would never need to know about or get involved in were being carried out, accompanied by the sounds of vulgar laughter.

I cannot understand even a micron of a fetish that gets aroused by the pitiful cries of a girl being squeezed out.

<b>

It's utterly disgusting.

<b>

Here, my recognition and evaluation of these guys were confirmed.

<b>

In short, these guys are pigs.

The moment I understood that, any intention to hold back completely vanished.

<b>

Including the perverts who seemed to be customers, I decided to crush all the filthy beasts one after another.

<b>

For the girls who were in dire situations, I used 'Bright Heal' and 'Greater Purify', and in some cases, 'Bright of Purge' as well.

Their wounds healed cleanly, and the state of addiction caused by drugs was purified, restoring the luster to their battered skin.

I used 'Bright of Purge' because there were several girls who had reached a 'cursed' state.

What the hell is going on here? What is this place!

<b>

Crush, heal, and crush again.

It took less than two minutes for the thin screams that had been echoing to be replaced by deep, filthy screams.

Two minutes might have been too long for exterminating the vermin.

<b>

Having mostly cleaned up, I headed to the third-floor office mentioned in Jules-Nahl's information.

I used 'Invisible Move' to conceal my presence and slipped into the room.

I had a faint hope of possibly securing useful information... like the contract that was said to have been exchanged with Karen.

<b>

But as I listened to this guy's words, I thought, why should I search for something passively like this!

Basically, I just need to make him produce it, right? Right?

<b>

So first, I smashed the desk he was sitting at.

The guy who was flipped over looked up at me with a foolish expression.

As two men approached sluggishly, I reached out my hand and snapped my fingers in front of their noses. The small shockwave generated blew the men away. They ended up getting well acquainted with the wall.

<b>

<b>

I told Fluke that he was the last one left, but he seemed too dim-witted to understand.

Even when I told him to shut up and hand over the contract, he just kept spewing foul language without making any progress.

<b>

It was utterly unpleasant to hear human words coming from a pig's mouth, so I rolled him around a few times until he finally stopped talking.

<b>

I asked again where Karen's contract was, and he looked at the remnants of what used to be a desk with his eyes trembling slightly, so I pried open the crushed drawer in the direction his gaze was directed.

A thick bundle of papers came out. Flipping through them, I found a familiar piece of paper written in Karen's handwriting on the first page.

It was written in Karen's hand, something like, "If I cannot keep my promise, I promise to do everything I can."

<b>

This is quite a one-sided demand.

All the other papers were handwritten and contained similar content.

Could it be that the girls below were all forced into such one-sided agreements and brought here against their will?

<b>

<b>

<b>

What the hell is this...?

<b>

<b>

<b>

Oh no, I just broke the window again with pressure.

This time, not just a crack, but it shattered completely.

Fluke was rolling his eyes and starting to twitch!

And he's leaking something! Gross!!

<b>

For now, ignoring the filth, I activated 'Fire' on the bundle of papers I just found and turned it to ash.

<b>

...Come to think of it, he had reacted to the word "contract," glancing at the wall several times.

<b>

Kicking the wall where he was looking, a hidden door burst open, revealing another hidden room!

Hmm, just like something out of a story!

Inside was a storage area? A small warehouse? The walls were filled with filing cabinets and medicine shelves. It was cramped.

Oh? There's a safe too.

Speaking of which, isn't he the one in charge of the safe?

<b>

The door of the safe was surprisingly easy to tear off with a bit of force.

Is it quite fragile?

I think it would be better to maintain it properly?

<b>

Inside, of course, there was money, along with what seemed to be contracts? And ledgers? Perhaps the hidden ledgers Anna-Mary mentioned? They were stuffed full.

Well, I don't really know, but it probably isn't anything good.

<b>

I could scatter the money to the girls below... but for now, I'll just leave it as is.

I think the people searching around this building will take care of it appropriately.

<b>

With that, I kicked Fluke out the window to head to the next location.

The reason for this was to have him guide me to another hideout.

<b>

The boss said there were three candidate hideouts.

Jules-Nahl said there were five.

But he also mentioned, "There might be a few others as well."

If there are more girls like those, I have no intention of leaving them be.

<b>

Then I can just have him guide me to all the other hideouts.

Since I've come this far, I will do everything I can!

<b>

<b>

Identifying the hideouts turned out to be surprisingly easy.

As I kicked Fluke along to the area marked on the map, groups of what seemed to be his comrades began to appear.

I would search the building they came out of, and by tossing Fluke into any active floors or rooms, the people inside would tell me whether it was a hideout or not.

After that, I would crush and subdue them, and if there were any hidden rooms or safes, I would destroy those too and call it a day.

<b>

<b>

Even though it was a back alley, as I kicked men through the bustling streets, quite a few eyes were drawn to us.

Unlike a soccer ball, every time I kicked, it made weird sounds like "gebyo!" or "gagyo!" and with a burly man rolling around while spewing blood, it certainly attracted attention.

<b>

I myself was suppressing my presence as much as possible except when I was kicking, so I probably wasn't noticed by the general public without needing to use 'Invisible Move'... probably!

<b>

<b>

Still, there were several groups watching us from a distance.

One of them is probably from the boss's place. Their presence is leaking everywhere, so they don't seem like professional scouts.

The others all seem to be moving in a coordinated, professional manner.

<b>

But one of those groups is probably related to Amukam. Maybe Anna-Mary's subordinates?

No, it might be someone from the Edgarla family, not the Bylos family.

They're moving in a three-dimensional manner across roofs and walls, and above all, they're dressed in black! Black outfits!!

<b>

Well, after I finish wrecking the hideouts, I can just leave the cleanup to these people! Yes!

<b>

So, I will crush all of Fluke's hideouts tonight.

So far, I think the number of subordinates I've taken down has exceeded three digits. Well, it doesn't really matter.

<b>

Even though the night is long, the time I can use is limited.

The nighttime cleanup is just beginning!

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

After sneaking out for about two hours, I was able to return to the dorm.

Feeling satisfied with a job well done, I returned to my room, only to find a scary-faced Bibi on my bed.

Huh? Why? Before I could voice my疑問, I was made to sit on the floor in seiza.

And then I received a lecture from Bibi.

<b>

Why? What for? I don't understand??

<b>

As my inner疑問 swelled, Bibi's eyes, which were already slightly raised, began to rise even more.

<b>

Furthermore, the strength and intensity of Bibi's scolding continued to rain down on me for nearly an hour.

Ughhhhhh――――.
