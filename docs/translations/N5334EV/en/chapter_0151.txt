# 139 - The Night Sweep.

"Shut up, shut up, shut up, you stink."

Gobesh!"

<blank>

I opened my mouth and kicked him away as he tried to dribble out another stinky breath.

The body flies through the air and shatters the door of the building it hits.

Oh, it moved. It's okay, you're still alive.

<blank>

The filth came out of the broken door, wallowing in the filth.

I fire a decoupin with exquisite "Ki" at them.

The Ki-infused shockwave released from the fingertips blasts the filth away from one side to the other.

<blank>

This is the seventh hideout.

It looks like a store with girls here.

No girl is in as bad a shape as the first place, but for some reason there are a number of girls in a 'cursed' state.

Well, let's destroy all the men here cleanly as planned without missing a single one.

<blank>

<blank>



<blank>

<blank>

The first place we raided was indeed the worst place to be.

This was no ordinary brothel, but rather a place that primarily catered to the needs of those with special sexual proclivities, and there was unbearable squalor to be found everywhere.

<blank>

A child whose face is so swollen that its original shape is unrecognizable.

A child whose limbs have not retained their proper shape.

A child who just keeps screaming insanely.

It was a place where acts that most normal people would not need to know about or be involved in during their lifetime were carried out with the sound of vulgar laughter.

I do not understand even a single micron of the girl's crying, her agitated sexuality, and so on.

<blank>

This is the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

<blank>

This is where my perception and evaluation of them was confirmed.

<blank>

In short, these people are pigs.

The moment they understand this, their desire to weigh themselves disappears cleanly.

<blank>

We decided to crush all the animals, including the perverts who seemed to be our customers.

<blank>

For the girls who were having a hard time, I used "Bright Heel" and "Greater Purify" and in some cases "Bright of Purge" as well.

Their wounds heal beautifully, their drug addiction is purified, and their battered skin regains its luster.

I used "Bright of Purge" because I had a number of children who were even in a "cursed" state.

What is this place? What is this place?

<blank>

Crush, crush, heal and crush.

It took less than two minutes for the thin screams that had been echoing up to that point to be replaced by thick, dirty screams.

Two minutes may have been too much time for a garbage bug extermination.

<blank>

Roughly cleaned up, I headed to the third floor office that Jules Nard had informed me about.

At one point, I used "Invisible Move" to remove any sign of him and entered the room.

Maybe some useful information ...... contract that you say you signed with Karen? I had a faint hope that I might be able to secure some useful information.

<blank>

But as I listened to what he had to say, I thought to myself, "I can't be so passive in my search! I thought.

In general, why don't you just let this guy take it out? Right?

<blank>

So first, I smashed the desk on which this guy was sitting.

The guy who was turned over by the momentum is looking up at us with a dumb face.

Two men came up to me and I reached up to their noses and gave them a finger-pounding motion. A small shockwave from this blasted the men away, and they continued to make friends with the wall with their whole bodies.

<blank>

<blank>

He tells Fluke that you are the only one left, but he doesn't seem to understand much, perhaps because he is not very smart.

Even if I told them to just shut up and give me a written contract, all they would do was string together a bunch of foul-mouthed words and get nowhere.

<blank>

It must be unpleasant to hear human words coming out of a pig's mouth, so I rolled it around a few times and it finally stopped spitting out words.

<blank>

Where is Karen's contract? I looked at the wreckage of what used to be a desk with a twitch in my eye, so I pried open the crushed drawer where my eyes were directed.

A thick bundle of papers came out from inside. As I flipped through it, I noticed a sheet of paper with a familiar script written on it.

Karen's character.

In Karen's handwriting, it read something like, 'If you can't keep your promise, I promise I will do everything I can to help you.

<blank>

This is a very one-sided demand.

The other papers are all handwritten and similar in content.

Could it be that all the children who were downstairs were forced into such a one-sided promise and brought in by force?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Screw you, asshole. .......

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oops, I broke the window again with pressure.

This time it wasn't just a crack, it was all cracked, palimpsest and all.

Fluke looks at the whites of his eyes, jiggles, and starts to convulse! and she's starting to convulse.

And they're dripping something! I'm so excited!

<blank>

For the time being, I let go of the filth and turned the bundle of papers I had just found into ashes by activating "Fire" in my hand.

<blank>

...... Well, he looked at the wall a few times, as if responding to the word "contract".

<blank>

I kicked the wall around the area I was looking at, and a hidden door blew open to reveal more hidden rooms!

Ummm, that's a picture-perfect development!

Is it a storage room inside? Maybe a little warehouse? The walls are filled with filing cabinets and medicine cabinets. It's very cramped.

Oh? There's also a safe.

Oh, by the way, is this guy a safecracker?

<blank>

The safe door could be torn off surprisingly easily with a little force.

Is it pretty fragile?

I think we should get the maintenance right, don't you?

<blank>

Inside, of course, there is money, but also contracts? And a ledger? The kind of back books that AnnaMarie was talking about? There were such things stuffed inside.

Well, I don't know, but as far as I'm concerned, it's a bonus.

<blank>

We can spread the money around to the girls downstairs at ....... Well, let's keep it open.

And I'm sure the people exploring around this building will take care of it just fine.

<blank>

That's why I kicked Fluke out the window to go to the next location.

The reason for all this is to get this guy to show me another hideout.

<blank>

Miss. said that there are three potential locations for the hideout.

Jules Nard said there are five places.

But, he also said, "there may be a few others."

If there are other girls like that, I'm not going to let it go.

<blank>

Then let him guide you to all the other hideouts.

I've come this far, so I'm going to go as far as I can!

<blank>

<blank>

Identifying the hideout was surprisingly easy.

I kicked and rolled Fluke to the area marked on the map, and what appeared to be a group of friends came fluttering out.

If you search the building they came out of and throw Fluke into a moving floor or room, the people inside will tell you if it's a hideout or not.

After that, we crush and subdue them, and if there are hidden rooms or safes, we destroy them as well, and that's the end of it.

<blank>

<blank>

Kicking a man through the downtown area, albeit on a back street, will attract a certain amount of attention.

Unlike a soccer ball, every time you kick it, you will hear "Gebyo! or "Gagyoggghh! and if a big guy is rolling around with blood spurting out of his mouth, that's bound to draw attention.

<blank>

I myself suppress my presence as much as I can except when I kick up, so the public probably doesn't notice me even if I don't use "invisible move" ......!

<blank>

<blank>

Even so, there are several groups of people who are watching us from afar.

Maybe one is the people at Miss. I don't feel like a professional reconnaissance person because the signs are so dodgy.

Everyone else is moving in a professional, controlled manner.

<blank>

But one of them is probably related to Amcam. Maybe under AnnaMarie's command?

No, not the Bairos family, but the hand of the Edgaras.

They're maneuvering three-dimensionally around roofs and walls and, most importantly, they're dressed in black! Black-armored!

<blank>

Well, we can do something drastic if we think we can just throw everyone to these people to clean up after destroying their hideout! Yeah!

<blank>

That is why we will destroy all of Fluke's hideouts from one side to the other by the end of tonight.

So far, I think the number of minions we've crushed has exceeded three digits. Well, whatever.

<blank>

Even though the night is long, there is only so much time available.

Night cleaning is just the beginning!

<blank>

<blank>



<blank>

<blank>

After about two hours of being out of the house, I was able to come back to the dormitory.

I had done a good job! When I returned to my room with a pleasant sense of accomplishment, I found Bibi with a scary face on my bed for some reason.

What? Why? I was made to sit on the floor, without even a moment to ask the question, "Why?

And just like that, Bibi gave me a sermon.

<blank>

Why? Why? I don't understand.

<blank>

As if sensing the swelling of my inner doubts, the corners of Bibi's eyes, which were already rising, began to rise.

<blank>

Furthermore, the thunderbolt of Bibi's words, which were filled with strength and vigor, continued to be fired at me for the next hour.

Ooohiiiiiiiii ----.
