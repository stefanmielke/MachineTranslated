# Episode 13: Howard Cloud Enjoys a Meal

From Cloud's perspective.

----------------

<b>

As we left the forest and approached the carriage, the girl was astonished by the horse.

She asked, "Is this what a 'horse' is?" When I confirmed, she touched its mane and scales with curiosity, repeatedly expressing her admiration and surprise.

<b>

Could it be that there were no horses in this girl's country? How did they travel or transport goods? My curiosity knows no bounds.

<b>

<b>

On the way to the mansion, I talked with the girl about various things.

She must be from a foreign land. It seems she understands the language I speak, but she is not used to speaking it herself, struggling to form words despite her earnest efforts.

<b>

This girl truly does not know how she ended up in the forest.

She says she found herself there without realizing how, but what on earth happened?

That forest is not a place where such a girl could be alone.

<b>

Certainly, there is no doubt about her ability to fell a wolf, but it is not a place where one could stay alone for days.

Especially now, when the situation is abnormal.

<b>

When I explained this to her carefully.

<b>

"That sounds... terrible..."

<b>

She replied with a slightly stiff expression, and I believe she understood how dangerous my situation had been.

<b>

<b>

Even so, she seemed to thoroughly enjoy the scenery of the village along the way.

<b>

The wheat fields stretching endlessly over the undulating hills.

Hodgson's pond, brimming with water, reflecting the clouds and thickets like a mirror, sparkling in the sunlight.

The poplars standing majestically, lining the endless black poplar avenue.

She gazed at each one with shining eyes.

It is truly delightful to think that she likes the village where I live.

<b>

<b>

Crossing the avenue and heading south down the road ahead, my home on the hill comes into view.

Since we are approaching from the north, only the roof of the mansion surrounded by windbreaks and the white outer walls can be seen, but we will arrive in just five minutes.

<b>

As we climb this gentle slope from the south, it seems that Sonia can see the carriage coming up from the living room.

It seems that Sonia can tell I am back from this point.

<b>

After guiding the carriage onto the property and stopping in front of the mansion, Sonia was already at the entrance.

Noticing that the person I brought was not Will, she looked puzzled.

<b>

As I helped the girl down from the carriage, I could see Sonia gasp.

<b>

"Ravi...?"

<b>

Sonia's murmur reminded me of the pain deep in my chest.

<b>

"Howard... Where is Will? And who is this child...?"

<b>

Sonia asked, not taking her eyes off the girl, as if she had just remembered something.

<b>

"Suzy... nice... to... meet... you."

<b>

The girl greeted while bowing her head, and Sonia responded with a smile, introducing herself in return.

<b>

"I saved her from the forest... or rather, she is my lifesaver."

<b>

At the words "lifesaver," Sonia's eyes widened.

It seems she noticed the girl's clothes and the dirt and damage on my shirt.

<b>

"What happened?! Are you hurt?! Are you both alright?!!"

<b>

Sonia's face stiffened, and she rushed over in a fluster, but...

<b>

<b>

Gurugyurururururururururururururu

<b>

<b>

It made a grand sound again.

<b>

It seems that she reacted to the delicious aroma wafting from the house.

This is undoubtedly the smell of herb-roasted chicken from the oven.

It is truly appetizing!

There is no way this hungry girl’s stomach would not react.

<b>

Hearing that sound, Sonia, who was about to rush over, froze.

In contrast, the girl turned bright red and looked down at the ground.

<b>

"Bufu!"

<b>

Seeing that, I couldn't help but burst out laughing.

The girl, trembling and holding back tears, looked up at me with a resentful red face.

<b>

No! I’m sorry.

But you see, your stomach made a sound at just the right moment.

Look, the tension that was there with Sonia just a moment ago has completely disappeared.

Your stomach is definitely reading the room, right? No doubt about it.

<b>

"Howard! It's rude to laugh at a girl! Poor thing, she's so red..."

"Ah, I apologize. But you see, I want to eat before we talk. I’ll leave the carriage, so could you prepare the meal?"

"…Yes, yes! That sounds good! Let’s eat while we talk! …But first… Elrose! Elrose, please!!"

<b>

Sonia came to the girl, bent down to her eye level, and while wiping the dirt from her face with her apron, called for Elrose from inside the house.

<b>

"Elrose, I want to give this child a bath and clean her up. Please hurry and prepare. I’ll get some clothes ready."

<b>

Elrose, peeking out from the mansion, looked surprised as she glanced between the girl and Sonia, then lightly bowed and quickly returned inside.

<b>

"Be a good girl and just hold on a little longer, okay? Once you're clean, we’ll eat right away?"

<b>

Following behind, Sonia led the girl into the mansion.

<b>

Now, I need to hurry and feed Regulus and get inside the mansion.

Thanks to the smell of the herb chicken or the influence of that girl’s stomach, mine has been growling non-stop since earlier.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

As I waited at the table set for the meal, Sonia brought the girl… Suzy, who entered the dining room awkwardly, saying, "I’m sorry to keep you waiting."

<b>

She looked transformed.

Once cleaned up, she had the neat features I had expected.

Her red hair was tied back, and she wore a light blue nightgown.

<b>

Ah, the size fits just right... it matches her hair color well.

<b>

Suzy seemed a bit shy and restless.

Once Elrose seated her, she stared intently at the dishes on the table.

She was practically leaning forward.

Now, now, you mustn't drool!

<b>

"Alright, we've kept you waiting long enough, haven't we? Please eat without hesitation."

<b>

Sonia and I smiled as we encouraged Suzy to eat, and Elrose served the herb chicken.

<b>

At first, she hesitated, bringing the chicken skewered on her fork close to her mouth, looking to see if it was okay to eat.

When I laughed and nodded vigorously, she seemed to gather her resolve and took a big bite.

It truly sounded like a "crunch."

<b>

The moment the chicken touched her mouth, Suzy's expression melted away.

She looked incredibly happy.

<b>

With the fork still in her left hand, she pressed her cheek with her right hand, tilting her face slightly to the right as she swayed it gently.

<b>

"Mmnnnn... Mmmmmm!!!"

<b>

Suzy's expression lit up.

Did it really seem like a light turned on? Or was it just my imagination?

<b>

From there, she couldn't stop.

The meal prepared in abundance for the big eater Will was disappearing one after another.

<b>

"Delicious! ...So delicious! ...So yummy... Oh! So good... Ugh... Hic... So good... Ugh... So delicious..."

<b>

Without stopping her hands, she chewed the food, praising the taste with tears in her eyes as she continued to eat.

...No, she is actually crying.

<b>

"Hey, a girl shouldn't eat while crying. The food isn't going anywhere, so calm down and eat properly, okay?"

"Y-yes... Hehe... So good..."

<b>

Sonia, while managing her own meal, diligently wiped Suzy's tears, cleaned her mouth, and brought the dishes closer to her, taking care of her.

Elrose also served food, exchanged plates, and refilled the soup, so in the end, the two of them were taking care of her.

<b>

It was as if they were looking after a small child, but even though she is a girl, she isn't that young, is she? Both of them.

Even so, watching the two of them happily take care of her made me smile.

Where on earth did all that food go in this petite body?

<b>

Eventually, the meal came to an end, and after savoring a sip of the tea Elrose brewed...

<b>

"Ahhh... the tea is... delicious..."

<b>

Suzy sighed deeply, murmuring with a blissful expression that melted my and Sonia's faces.

<b>

After that, while drinking the post-meal tea, I told Sonia about what had happened today.

<b>

<b>

That Will could not come.

<b>

That I encountered a two-headed boar and a gray wolf in the forest.

<b>

When I told her that Suzy had defeated one of the wolves and detoxified me...

<b>

"This young lady did that...?"

<b>

Elrose exclaimed in surprise.

Sonia's eyes widened in astonishment as well.

<b>

"I plan to take her to Henry's place afterward..."

<b>

After conveying everything, I sipped my tea and told Sonia.

<b>

"What do you intend to do with this child afterward?"

<b>

Sonia set down her teacup and quietly asked, keeping her eyes downcast.

<b>

"A consultation is necessary. We must at least know where she came from to return her to her family. That is what the temple is for."

"…Yes, that is true... How worried her parents must be..."

<b>

"Um... am I... going somewhere...?"

<b>

Suzy asked with a slight furrow in her brow.

<b>

"Well! I’m sorry. It must make you anxious, right? But don’t worry! You can come back here right away. Right? Isn’t that so, Howard?"

"Of course! Once the business is done, I’ll bring you back. You are my lifesaver, after all, so you must relax in the mansion tonight!"

"Then, sir, is it alright to prepare dinner as planned?"

"Ah, please do. I’ll certainly be back by dinner. If I remember correctly, we were using deer, right?"

"Yes, the deer we received is just right for eating, and since it was Will's favorite, we had planned a full course with venison for tonight."

"...Deer... full course... meat?"

"Oh? Suzy-chan reacted to that. Hehe, even though you just ate so much, you really are a glutton."

<b>

Sonia laughed heartily.

As Suzy turned red and looked down, Elrose smiled and comforted her, saying that’s just how growing kids are.

<b>

How many years has it been since I’ve had such a joyful dining table?

How long has it been since Sonia has laughed so happily?

<b>

If only I could wish for such days to return once more.
