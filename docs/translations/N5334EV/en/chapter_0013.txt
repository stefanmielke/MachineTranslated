# 13 Howard Cloud Enjoying a meal

This is Mr. Cloud's perspective.


----------------

<blank>

When I led her out of the forest and into the carriage, she was surprised to see the horse.

Is this what you call a horse? When I told him that it was, he touched its mane and scales with curiosity, and was impressed and surprised at the same time.

<blank>

Were there no horses in this girl's country? What kind of means of transportation and transport did they use? My curiosity is boundless.

<blank>

<blank>

On the way to the mansion, I talked with the girl about many things.

She must be from outside of Japan, after all. The girl seemed to understand what we were saying, but she was not used to speaking.

<blank>

This girl really doesn't know how she got to the forest.

You say you found yourself in the woods, but what the hell happened?

That forest is no place for such a girl to be alone.

<blank>

There is no doubt that he is capable of defeating Wolf, but he cannot stay alone for days at a time.

And now, moreover, we are in an unusual situation.

<blank>

I'll explain that in detail.

<blank>

It's... difficult... for... you.

<blank>

I think he understood how dangerous he was in the situation, because he answered with a slightly stiffened face.

<blank>

<blank>

Still, they seemed to enjoy the scenery of the village to the fullest along the way.

<blank>

Across the undulations, wheat fields continue to spread to the horizon.

Hodgson's Pond is filled to the brim with water, reflecting the clouds and thickets like a mirror surface, and sparkling in the sunlight.

The avenues of poplars that stand tall and majestic are lined with endless avenues of blackberry trees.

She looked at them all with a twinkle in her eye.

It is a joy to hear that people like the village where you live.

<blank>

<blank>

If you cross the tree-lined street and go south down the road beyond, you will see our house on the hillside.

Since we are going around from the north, we can only see the roof of the mansion surrounded by a windbreak and a few white exterior walls, but in another five minutes we will be there.

<blank>

They say that just as you walk up this gentle slope on the south side, you can see the carriage coming up from the living room.

Sonia said she could tell when I was coming back from this area.

<blank>

When we pulled the carriage into the grounds and attached it to the front of the mansion, Sonia was already at the front door.

He realizes that the person who brought him here is not Will and looks quizzical.

<blank>

I could see Sonia gasp as she helped the girl get out of the carriage.

<blank>

Ravi ......?"

<blank>

Sonia's murmur reminds me of the pain deep in my chest.

<blank>

"Howard ....... What happened to Will? Who is the boy ............?"

<blank>

Sonia asked as if she remembered, without taking her eyes off the girl.

<blank>

"Suzy... nice... to... meet... you."

<blank>

The girl bowed her head in greeting, and Sonia responded by smiling and introducing herself.

<blank>

I protected ...... in the woods, or rather, saved my life."

<blank>

Sonia's eyes widened at the words "saved my life.

Apparently, he noticed dirt and damage to the girl's clothes and the eagle's shirt.

<blank>

What happened? Are you hurt? Are you two all right?

<blank>

Sonia's face was tense and she rushed to me as if in a panic. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Gurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.

<blank>

<blank>

It rang grandly again.

<blank>

Apparently, they were reacting to the savory smells wafting from the house.

This is definitely the smell of an herb bird roasting in the oven.

It is truly appetizing!

There is no reason not to stimulate this hungry girl's stomach.

<blank>

Hearing the sound, Sonia, who was about to run over, froze.

In contrast, the girl turned bright red and turned over on the spot.

<blank>

Bufo!"

<blank>

I can't help but blow up unbearably at the sight of them.

The girl pulled and held back tears and looked up at me with a red face and a bitter look on her face.

<blank>

Nope! I am sorry.

But you know, your tummy rumbles at just the right time.

See, the tension that existed earlier has cleanly disappeared from Sonia.

Your tummy is definitely reading the air, isn't it? I'm sure of it.

<blank>

Howard! It's rude to laugh at a girl! Poor thing, she's so red ......"

I'm sorry. But I'd like to eat before we talk. I'll leave the carriage here. Can you prepare it for me?"

I'm going to go to ......, yeah, yeah! Yes, I do! Let's do that! Let's talk over dinner! ...... But first, ......, Elrose! Elrose please!

<blank>

When Sonia came to the girl, she bent down to the girl's eye level and called for Elrose in the house, using her own apron to clean the dirt off her face.

<blank>

Elle Rose, I need to bathe her and clean her up. Please hurry up and get ready. I'll go get you a change of clothes."

<blank>

Elrose, who had just emerged from the mansion, looked at the girl and Sonia alternately in surprise, then bowed lightly and immediately returned to the mansion.

<blank>

"You're a good girl, just be patient a little bit longer, okay? Let's have dinner right after I get you cleaned up, okay?"

<blank>

Sonia follows the girl into the mansion.

<blank>

Now, I must quickly give Regulus a fodder and go into the mansion myself.

Whether it's the smell of the herb bird or the effects of her stomach bug, my stomach has been rumbling for some time now.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

While waiting at a table lined with food, a girl ...... Susie, accompanied by Sonia, entered the dining room, saying with a faltering, "Sorry to keep you waiting.

<blank>

It looks different.

When polished up nicely, it had a well-defined face, just as I had expected.

Her red hair is tucked back and she wears a pale blue loungewear.

<blank>

Oh, and the size is just right, ......, it matches her hair color well.

<blank>

Suzy is a little embarrassed and restless.

When Elrose seats her, she stares at the food on the table as if devouring it.

That's exactly what I'm leaning forward to do.

Kore Kore Kore, don't make me drool, okay?

<blank>

Now, I've left you with a lot of food, haven't I? Eat as much as you like.

<blank>

Vashi and Sonia, smiling, offered Suzy a meal, and Elrose served her with a share of the herb bird.

<blank>

At first he was reserved and asked me with his eyes if he could eat the bird, holding it close to his mouth, which was stuck in the fork in his hand.

Laughing and nodding broadly, he bit down at once, as if determined to do so.

That's what it sounded like, like a real 'crackling' sound.

<blank>

Once the bird is in his mouth, Suzy's expression melts away.

It looks so happy.

<blank>

With a fork in his left hand in his mouth, he holds his cheek with his right hand, his face tilted lightly to the right, shaking it lily-white.

<blank>

Nnnnnn...mmmm...mmmm!!!!"

<blank>

Suzy's face lit up.

Is it my imagination that it really looked like a light went on?

<blank>

It didn't stop there.

<blank>

The food that had been prepared in large portions for Will, who is a glutton, disappears one after another.

<blank>

Oh, Oishii! It's ・・・・ Oishii! ・・・・Ooh, oishi! Oihi・・・・ ugh... hiccup... Oihi・・・・ ugh・・・・ oihi...!"

<blank>

He chews his food without stopping, and continues to eat, praising the flavors as if he were about to cry.

...... No, you're actually crying.

<blank>

You girls shouldn't eat with tears in your eyes. The dishes aren't going anywhere, so calm down and eat properly, okay? Okay?"

"Ha-hi... yes... hi-hi... hi-hi... hi-hi..."

<blank>

Sonia takes care of Suzy's meals, wiping her tears, her mouth, and the food.

Elrose also shares the food, replaces plates and refills the soup, and in the end the two of them take care of her.

<blank>

You look as if you're taking care of a little girl's food, but you're not that young to be a little girl, are you? Both of you.

Still, seeing the two of them happily taking care of her makes my cheeks relax.

<blank>

Where did that much food disappear into this petite body?

<blank>

Eventually, the meal was over, and I tasted a sip of after-dinner tea made by Elrose. ......

<blank>

Haaaa...ocha...yummy..."

<blank>

Suzy muttered with a face that looked as happy as if she were debauched, while letting out a loud exhale.

The expression on their faces causes Eagle's and Sonia's faces to become prodigal.

<blank>

Later, over after-dinner tea, I told Sonia about what had happened today.

<blank>

<blank>

That Will is no longer able to come.

<blank>

Encountering a two-headed boa and a gray wolf in the forest.

<blank>

Suzy told him that she had defeated one of the wolves and detoxified the eagle's poison.

<blank>

Is this the young lady? ......?"

<blank>

Elrose said in surprise.

Sonia is also wide-eyed and surprised.

<blank>

I'm going to take you to Henry's after this ......"

<blank>

After he finished telling her the whole story, he told Sonia as he sipped his tea.

<blank>

What are you planning to do with her?

<blank>

Sonia puts down her tea cup and quietly asks with her eyes downcast.

<blank>

We need to talk to them. If we don't know where they came from, we can't deliver them to their families. That's what the temple is for."

"...... yes, that's right. ............ I can't imagine how concerned the parents are about ........."

<blank>

Do you want me to go somewhere?

<blank>

Susie raised her eyebrows a little and asked.

<blank>

<blank>

Well! I'm sorry. I know it makes you anxious, doesn't it? But don't worry! We'll be right back here. Right, Howard? Right, Howard?

Of course! I'll be back when I'm done. You are my benefactor, and I must ask you to stay in the house tonight!

'Well then, sir, are you sure you want to prepare dinner as planned?

Oh, for God's sake. I'll be back in time for dinner, of course. We'll be back in time for dinner, of course.

Yes, the deer we got is just about ready to eat, it was Will's favorite, and we were going to have a full course of venison tonight."

"...shi-shika... fu-furukosu... o-niku?"

Oh? Susie-chan reacted. I just ate so much food, but you really are a glutton.

<blank>

Sonia laughs colossally.

When Suzy turns red and looks down, Elrose consoles her with a smile, saying, "That's how it is when you're in the middle of eating.

<blank>

I haven't had such a pleasant dining experience in years.

When was the last time I saw Sonia smile so happily?

<blank>

I can't help but wish that if it were possible, days like this would come again.
