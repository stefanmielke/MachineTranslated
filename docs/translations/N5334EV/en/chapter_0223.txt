# 211 Terrill's Blessing

The giant beast slowly stepped out.

The cobblestones swayed.

A terra dog with a destroyed spinal cord lay at the end of his steps.

This is the individual whose "linear magical life form" was crushed by Karen.

When the Giant Beast steps on the motionless carcass, the Terror Dog's body is suddenly absorbed by the Giant Beast.

<blank>

In addition, there are two more individuals still moving ahead of the Giant Beast.

Those are the magical beasts whose spines were broken by Cordilleras.

These are not damaged to the "linear magical life form" inside the body. They are still active, but their bodies are in the process of repairing themselves and they are still unable to move properly.

<blank>

The tip of the hind leg of one of the stuck monsters touched the leg of the giant beast that was walking forward.

When their feet touched, the terra dog's lower body was suddenly absorbed by the giant beast.

Only the upper half of his body, which was still barely able to move, was flailing around like a jittery algae scratch.

But little by little, it was absorbed by the legs of the giant beast and finally swallowed cleanly.

<blank>

The giant beast did not seem to pay any attention to such things, and continued to move forward with its feet.

The other beast ahead of him was also flapping its limbs and struggling to stand up.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Another thing is the body of Cordelia, who is left lying there without a word.

Now, a light quietly lights up in its bosom.

<blank>

It is a golden clean shine.

The light, which was small at first, enveloped Cordelia's entire body as she watched.

The golden light that enveloped his entire body shone brightly.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

And the giant beast noticed it.

No, the girl's body stretches out from the neck of the giant beast, and her face, with its reddish-black lines etched like tears, is filled with surprise.

At the same time, a distressed cry echoed around the area.

<blank>

The girl scratches at the algae in an attempt to change the destination of the giant beast, but the giant does not listen to her as she expected.

Still trying to force the person to turn around, he twisted the person's body repeatedly, his face contorting in pain.

Finally, I was able to tilt the body of the giant beast to change the direction of travel.

However, the leaning behemoth loses its balance and drifts sideways.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Cordelia's bosom jumped up significantly.

At the same time, the sound of something shattering makes a small echo in my chest.

Immediately after, Cordilia coughed violently.

He bends his body to the side in a crouching position and tries to expel the foreign body stuck in his bronchial tubes in a painful manner.

<blank>

He calmed down somewhat and tried to put strength in his arms to raise his body, breathing heavily. He opened his eyes, but thanks to the coughing, tears were pooling and his vision was distorted, so he could not see much around him.

My body needs oxygen, and my rough breathing is not calming down.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The giant beast had moved directly to the edge of the observatory.

The girl's face is as if she is relieved, and the tension has melted from her face.

Immediately, however, his face is distorted with sadness.

With its gaze still poured on the place to which it had just turned.

<blank>

Suddenly, the body of the giant beast shook on the spot.

The rim of the observatory could not support its massive body, and it began to crumble underfoot.

Slowly, the foothold collapses and the body of the giant beast sinks down the cliff along with the earth and stones.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Cordilleras barely half-raised himself with his strength-less arms, wiped away tears, looked around and checked his surroundings.

<blank>

Then came the vibrations of the earth and the sound of what sounded like a landslide.

I looked toward the sound and caught sight of a huge beast about to fall from the edge of the observatory.

And somehow, I saw Karen's face there, too.

Am I looking at this wrong?

To Cordelia's eyes, it looked as if Karen was buried in the body of the giant beast.

<blank>

Ka, karen ...... gosh gosh gosh!　Karen?　Gosh!

<blank>

He suddenly tries to speak and coughs again.

But what I saw was definitely Karen. Why on earth would she do that?

<blank>

<blank>

When the vibrations from the giant beast's fall had subsided.

The last terra dog was finally standing up. It took a step forward on its paw, as if to make sure its legs would work.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was there that Cordelia first came to realize her current situation.

The taste of blood lingers in the mouth.

If you wipe your mouth with your hand, blood will stick to the back of your hand.

<blank>

Then I remembered what happened just before I lost consciousness.

I'm talking about the strong shock I received from my back to my chest.

I put my hand on my chest without thinking. The garment is ripped and my hand touches my skin.

The ripped clothing is still smeared with a large amount of blood.

<blank>

I was struck with intense vertigo as I tried to raise my body. My body was shaking.

I put my hand on my forehead and began to vaguely remember what had happened to me.

I thought I heard Karen's terrible crying voice very far away.

It overlaps with Karen's face that I saw earlier.

<blank>

But why am I still in one piece?　I put my hand on my chest where the wound should have been.

Then, something in his breast pocket made a clinking sound.

<blank>

--I'm sure there's a brooch in here that your father gave me--

<blank>

Cordilia reached into her breast pocket and fingered what was in there.

<blank>

From his pocket, he pulled out a few broken pieces of stone.

The golden stone inlaid in the brooch had been shattered and dislodged.

The stone, which should have emitted a golden glow, has lost its color and luster.

<blank>

<blank>

It is one of the relics called "Terrill's Blessing".

It is a miracle of the world god that contains the power to heal and save the life of the wearer only once when he or she receives a fatal wound.

However, the probability of success is just under 20%.

<blank>

<blank>

Cordilia had no way of knowing the benefits this relic would bring, but she had heard somewhere that there was a magical tool that had such an effect.

The miracle shown by Jessica Karloff at the Consulate of Amkam comes to mind.

<blank>

--The teachers who saw this - they said. This brooch is protecting me--I am a good person.

<blank>

Cordilia placed the shard of shattered stone in her hand and held it to her chest, gripping it so tightly that her hand turned white.

<blank>

Thank you for ......." Father."

<blank>

And as it was, he said thank you in a small but strong and forceful way.

<blank>

I remember my father's kind eyes when he handed me the brooch.

The thought of his father fills his heart and makes the back of his eyes burn.

<blank>

<blank>

But Cordelia immediately looks up.

Then he turned his strong gaze to where the giant beast had fallen.

<blank>

He tried to stand up as he was, but his body was not strong enough.

I try my best to muster up the energy, but my limbs are just shaking.

Her body had lost so much blood that she was unable to stand.

<blank>

<blank>

Then the footsteps of a rushing beast approach.

It's the sound of the only remaining terra dog running.

<blank>

By the time Cordelia realized what was happening, the fangs of the magical beast were almost upon her.

But Cordilleras did not try to avoid it, but instead waited for the monster beast to charge head-on.

<blank>

Cordelia puts her open hands out in front of her to protect herself from the fangs of the terra dog that is aiming for her neck.

The skin of the fingertip that snagged the fang ripped open and blood gushed from it.

However, he was able to avoid having his fangs poked into his neck.

He put his arms around the neck of the beast that was leaning on him and held it as tight as he could.

<blank>

The magical beast violently flails about trying to shake it loose.

However, the movement of the magical beast became slower and slower, and eventually it became docile and sat down on the spot.

<blank>

After confirming that the movement is under control, Cordelia raises herself up, using Terradog's neck as a support.

Then, using his arms with little strength, he finally managed to cling to the back of it.

<blank>

<blank>

You will manipulate this terra doc to go after Karen.

The thought of sitting here and waiting for rescue never crossed Cordelia's mind.

I don't know what I can do now.

But I can't leave Karen like this.

<blank>

I can still see Karen's face as she fell off the cliff.

There was no way I could leave Karen alone with such a sad face!

<blank>

I'll be right there! I'm coming by right now!"

<blank>

Cordilia ran the terra dog with both arms clinging to its neck.

To go to the one and only, irreplaceable partner.
