# Chapter 211: The Blessing of Teril

The giant beast slowly took a step forward.

The stone pavement shook heavily.

Ahead lay a Terradog with its spine shattered.

It was the individual crushed by Karen's "Linear Magical Lifeform."

As the giant beast stepped on the unmoving corpse, the body of the Terradog was instantly absorbed by the giant beast.

<b>

Further ahead, there were still two moving individuals.

These were magical beasts with their spines broken by Cordelia.

They had not sustained damage to the "Linear Magical Lifeform" inside them. While they were capable of activity, their bodies were in the process of repair and could not move properly yet.

<b>

The hind foot of one immobile magical beast touched the leg of the advancing giant beast.

The Terradog that was touched by the foot had its lower body instantly absorbed by the giant beast.

Only the upper body, which was still barely able to move, thrashed around in a desperate struggle.

However, it was gradually absorbed by the giant beast's leg and was eventually completely swallowed.

<b>

Unconcerned by such events, the giant beast continued to move forward.

The other magical beast, still present, was flailing its limbs in an attempt to stand.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

And then there was another, the silent body of Cordelia lying in this place.

At that moment, a light quietly illuminated her chest.

<b>

It was a pure golden glow.

Initially small, the light quickly enveloped Cordelia's entire body.

The golden light wrapping around her shone particularly brightly.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The giant beast noticed it.

No, it was the girl’s body extending from the giant beast's neck that noticed, her face marked with red-black lines like tears, filled with surprise.

At the same time, a painful scream echoed around.

<b>

The girl struggled to change the direction of the giant beast's advance, but the massive body did not obey her will.

Still, she desperately twisted her human form, grimacing in pain, trying to force a change in direction.

Finally, she managed to tilt the giant beast's body to change its course.

However, the tilted giant body lost its balance and began to sway sideways.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Cordelia's chest heaved upward.

At the same time, a sound of something breaking echoed softly around her chest.

Immediately after, Cordelia coughed violently.

She bent her body sideways, trying to expel the foreign object lodged in her bronchial tubes.

<b>

Having somewhat calmed down, she tried to gather strength in her arms to sit up. She opened her eyes, but tears from coughing blurred her vision, making it hard to see her surroundings.

Her body seemed to need oxygen, and her rough breathing would not settle down.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The giant beast had moved all the way to the edge of the observation deck.

The girl's face relaxed, as if relieved.

However, it quickly twisted into a sorrowful expression.

Her gaze remained fixed on the place she had just looked at.

<b>

Suddenly, the giant beast's body swayed in place.

The edge of the observation deck could no longer support its massive form, and the ground beneath began to crumble.

Slowly, the footing gave way, and along with the earth and stones, the giant beast began to fall down the cliff.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Cordelia, with her weak arms, managed to prop herself up and wiped her tears, looking around to assess her surroundings.

<b>

At that moment, the ground trembled, and a sound like a landslide echoed.

Turning her gaze toward the sound, she caught sight of the giant beast about to fall from the edge of the observation deck.

And for some reason, she also saw Karen's face there.

Was this a misperception?

To Cordelia's eyes, it looked as if Karen was buried within the body of the giant beast.

<b>

“Ka, Ka… cough cough! Karen? Cough!”

<b>

She tried to call out suddenly but was seized by another fit of coughing.

Yet what she saw was indeed Karen. Why was this happening?

<b>

<b>

When the vibrations from the giant beast's fall subsided.

The last Terradog finally stood up. It stepped forward with its front leg, as if confirming its ability to move.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Cordelia finally realized her current situation.

There was a metallic taste of blood in her mouth.

When she wiped her mouth with her hand, blood smeared onto the back of her hand.

<b>

Then she recalled what had happened just before she lost consciousness.

The strong impact she received from her back to her chest.

She instinctively placed her hand on her chest. Her clothing was torn, and her skin was touched by her hand.

The torn clothing was indeed soaked with a large amount of blood.

<b>

As she tried to sit up, a severe dizziness struck her. Her body swayed unsteadily.

She placed her hand on her forehead, trying to vaguely remember what had happened to her.

Karen's anguished cries seemed to echo from very far away.

That image overlapped with the face of Karen she had just seen.

<b>

Yet why was she still safe now? She placed her hand on her chest, where she knew there had been wounds.

Then, something in her chest pocket clinked.

<b>

――There should be the brooch I received from my father in here――

<b>

Cordelia reached into her chest pocket and touched the item inside.

<b>

What she pulled out from her pocket were several shattered fragments of stone.

The golden stone that had been set in the brooch had broken and fallen out.

The stone that had once emitted a golden glow now lost both its color and brilliance.

<b>

<b>

That was one of the holy relics known as "The Blessing of Teril."

It contained the miracle of the world god, which could heal a fatal wound and provide life-saving treatment once when the bearer received a mortal injury.

However, the success rate was merely a little under twenty percent.

<b>

<b>

Cordelia had no way of knowing the blessings this holy relic brought, but she had heard somewhere that there were magical tools with such effects.

The miracle Jessica Caroff had shown at the Amkam Consulate floated in her mind.

<b>

――The teachers who saw this said that this brooch is protecting me――

<b>

Cordelia held the shattered stone fragments in her hand against her chest, gripping them tightly until her hand turned white.

<b>

“...Thank you. Father.”

<b>

And then, she expressed her gratitude softly but with strength.

The gentle eyes of her father when he had given her the brooch came to mind.

Her father's feelings welled up in her chest, and her eyes began to heat up.

<b>

<b>

But Cordelia quickly lifted her face.

And she directed her strong gaze toward where the giant beast had fallen.

<b>

She tried to stand up but found she could not muster any strength in her body.

Desperately, she tried to summon her willpower, but her limbs only trembled.

Having lost too much blood, her body was no longer able to stand.

<b>

<b>

The sound of beastly footsteps approached.

It was the sound of the only remaining Terradog running.

<b>

By the time Cordelia noticed, the magical beast's fangs were already close.

However, Cordelia did not try to evade it; instead, she awaited the magical beast's charge head-on.

<b>

Cordelia extended her open hands forward to shield herself from the fangs of the Terradog aiming for her neck.

The skin on her fingertips was torn, and blood spurted out from there.

However, she managed to avoid having the fangs pierce her neck.

With that, she wrapped her arms around the neck of the magical beast and embraced it tightly.

<b>

The magical beast thrashed violently, trying to shake her off.

But its movements gradually slowed, and eventually, it calmed down and sat down in place.

<b>

Confirming that it had stopped moving, Cordelia used the Terradog's neck to prop herself up.

With all her might, she clung to its back.

<b>

She would control this Terradog and chase after Karen.

The thought of staying here and waiting for rescue never crossed Cordelia's mind.

She did not know what she could do now.

But she could not leave Karen like this.

<b>

Karen's face as she fell from the cliff was burned into her memory.

There was no way she could abandon Karen, who looked so sorrowful!

<b>

“Wait for me, Karen. I will come to you right now!”

<b>

Cordelia clung to the Terradog's neck with both arms and urged it to run.

To head toward the one and only irreplaceable companion.
