# Chapter 68: The Fierce Battle of the Mobile Heavy Knight

A year has passed since the publication began.

Thank you to everyone who has accompanied me this far.

<b>

I want to somehow write it all the way to the end without letting it go stagnant, so I would be happy if you could stay with me until the end!

<b>

I haven't written much yet, but... I thought it might be a good stopping point? So I'm posting a chapter.

----------------

<b>

On the 4th of the Red Moon, Year 2, 18:40 PM

<b>

"Solid Squad! Cornell!! Stop them at all costs! Activate full phalanx intermittently! You must hold them back!!"

<b>

As the sun set and the dim light approached through the trees, Cedric Meyer, having cleaved the skull knight's head with its chipped longsword, raised his voice to issue commands.

<b>

"Fred! Hurry and secure the materials! Medical team! Lisa! Maintain the range of the sanctum! If the injured are not severely wounded, let them use the medical patches we have! Know that the magic power of the medical team is our lifeline!!"

<b>

The slain skull knight turned into particles of light and vanished.

Cedric continued to issue commands to the squad, smashing the skulls of the undead that surged forth again.

<b>

There were six members of the Solid Squad, who held large tower shields. They lined up in a row, building a wall.

There was more than a two-meter gap between the knights holding the shields, but a powerful magical barrier was stretched between them.

<b>

"Protective Formation"

A sturdy barrier used by shield bearers.

A magical shield is deployed around the shield bearer, extending approximately two meters in radius.

<b>

The parallel-activated magical walls deployed side by side are called "Full Phalanx," providing even stronger resistance to magic and physical attacks.

It pushed back the waves of undead that surged like rough seas in an instant.

<b>

Inside that wall, the main knight squad stood by, surrounded by the sanctum created by the holy classes to protect them.

The undead avoided the holy barrier, concentrating their assault on the front phalanx.

<b>

The Solid Squad raised their voices, timing their movements, and repeated the parallel activation.

Many undead rushed in during the gaps created by the intermittent full phalanx.

A massive figure with horns on its forehead stretched its half-decayed arm through the momentarily weakened barrier, trying to drag down the shield bearer.

A pig-faced mass of flesh bared its cloudy white eyes, bubbling in its throat, and twisted its head in a silent scream.

The main knight squad positioned behind the Solid Squad processed the overflowing undead one after another.

<b>

Some thrust with spear axes. Others smashed with longswords and battle axes.

Those who used magic shot fireballs and arrows of light.

Everyone resisted the relentless tide of undead with their respective weapons.

<b>

"They're coming! One large one in front! Two special types!!"

<b>

Leading the Solid Squad at the forefront, Cornell Warlich, the squad leader, shouted, announcing the approach of the unusual enemies with a voice that cut through the battlefield's chaos.

<b>

From between the conifer trees, a giant skull with dark eye sockets glared at them, lit with vengeful flames.

A large skeleton stepped forward leisurely.

<b>

Behind it, two white, band-like objects crossed each other alternately, also advancing toward them.

<b>

"Skull Centipede"

Its length is approximately 20 meters. A large centipede-like body made of white bones, with the upper body of a giant skeleton. Its scythe-like claws, resembling those of a mantis, mercilessly shred their prey.

It is a terrifying large undead with a threat level of 110.

<b>

In response to Cornell's shout, Howard stepped forward.

<b>

"Kyle! I'll leave the Great Skull to you! Show us what you can do!! Gilbert! Take care of the surrounding riffraff!! Conrad! Don't slack off!!!"

"Yes!!"

"Leave it to me."

"Ha! Don't fall behind, Howard!"

<b>

The members of the Solid Squad synchronized their movements to push open the mass of undead surging like a white tsunami, and four of them jumped into the white murky flow.

<b>

The undead immediately swarmed around them, but in the next moment, as the wave crashed against the rocky surface, the white bones of the undead and the bloodless rotten flesh shattered and scattered.

Just like grass being cut in a meadow, the undead crumbled and sank, scattering away.

The paths they carved through the white mass twisted like a snake, creating a way through the densely packed white swarm.

<b>

Gilbert, running low, swiftly wielded his longsword in his right hand and dagger in his left, cutting down the undead one after another.

Before him, the mass of undead was no different from a thicket of grass that reached his height.

<b>

The eye patch covering Gilbert's left eye, the magical symbols etched into his leather armor, and the longsword and dagger emitted an ice-green light.

The pale green trails etched paths through the white, swaying waves of undead.

<b>

Two shadows charged through that path like cannonballs, further widening the way.

<b>

Anything in the direct line of those shadows was knocked aside and shattered, expanding the space around them.

<b>

One of the shadows easily reached its target and let out a roar.

<b>

"Hercules' Howl"

<b>

Conrad Blauk's roar, infused with magic, temporarily boosted the strength of himself and his allies in the area, enhancing their concentration.

Furthermore, the magic power carried by the roar created a large ripple, temporarily hindering the movements of those struck by it.

If the target moved with magic, the effect was particularly pronounced.

The undead, moving with magic, momentarily halted at Conrad's shout.

<b>

Conrad would not miss that opportunity.

Showing his teeth in a ferocious grin, he leaped forward to reap his prey.

Twisting his body, he pulled back his massive battle axe to the right, gathering strength, and charged toward his target.

<b>

The Skull Centipede's paralysis was brief. It immediately raised its massive scythe-like hands toward the approaching Conrad.

<b>

However, that moment was enough for Conrad. He had already slipped into the embrace of the massive creature and unleashed a deadly strike.

<b>

"Limit Axe Blow"

<b>

The magical symbols on his equipment shone vermilion, and the furious crimson energy smashed through the giant enemy without hesitation.

His raised arm shattered the exposed midsection, where the centipede's body connected to the upper body of the skeleton, causing it to explode.

<b>

The upper body, now devoid of support and resembling a white, hard, distorted fence, twisted in mid-air and fell to the ground.

The centipede's body also shattered into a third of its length due to the impact.

The eye sockets of the skull, which should have no means to open, widened in disbelief at what had just happened.

<b>

As the falling body vibrated against the ground, Conrad delivered a follow-up strike.

<b>

"Meteor Fall"

<b>

A strike, burning red like the wrath of a god, resonated with tremendous impact against the earth, shattering the giant skull that resembled a human form.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

The two large scythes of the Skull Centipede swung down toward Howard Cloud with great force from above.

Howard opened his gray eyes, glowing with light, and glared at the grotesque object made of human bones... the white blades approaching him.

<b>

As he watched the hard white blades descend, Howard, with a shout of determination, swung his black greatsword with both hands.

The black greatsword "Grand Divider" glowed with a faintly pure blue hue, illuminating the darkening forest space.

<b>

The blue line drawn by the Grand Divider intersected with the two large scythes of the Skull Centipede.

In that moment, the scythes shattered as if made of candy or ice, scattering into pieces.

<b>

Suddenly realizing it had lost its weapon, the dark flames of vengeance flickered in the Skull Centipede's silent eye sockets.

At the same time, it let out an angry roar, shaking its skull at the audacious little creature that dared to oppose it.

<b>

The furious wail of the dead shook the air, robbing the living of their sanity. However, it did not reach Howard.

The Skull Centipede, now without its arms, opened its massive jaws and twisted its long body, lunging toward its target.

<b>

Howard positioned the greatsword beside his face, aiming its tip at the enemy, lowered his stance, twisted his body, and gathered strength like drawing a bow.

The moment the giant jaws were about to bite Howard, the magical symbols on his equipment shone brightly.

From the shoulder pads resembling flames, a blue glow formed a line, flowing through his arm and into the greatsword, concentrating a vast amount of magical power.

<b>

"Impact Blitz"

<b>

With a thunderous roar, the blue shockwave from the greatsword pierced and shattered the approaching giant skull.

The impact nearly penetrated the centipede-like main body as well.

The grotesque object made of white bones crumbled noisily before Howard.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

"You seem to have managed to take it down well... Kyle?"

"I successfully defeated it, sir."

"Haah! ...Haah! ...Haah! ...Thanks to Mr. Gilbert... I... I couldn't have done it without him...!"

<b>

Howard asked Kyle Urban, who had removed his helmet and collapsed on the ground, panting heavily.

At first, Kyle had been bewildered by the Great Skull's speed and overwhelming durability.

However, with Gilbert's support, he managed to shatter the Great Skull's tibia, causing it to lose balance and fall, allowing him to smash its head and barely secure the kill.

The magic power storage device of the heavy mobile magical armor was completely empty, including the reserves.

For Kyle, this was a hard-won victory, having exhausted both his stamina and magic power.

<b>

"The head of the Great Skull is incredibly hard. You managed to crack it while getting help! Impressive!"

<b>

Conrad praised Kyle's achievement while quenching his thirst with a water bottle he received from the logistics team.

<b>

"Thank you, Lord Cloud! Lord Conrad! And Mr. Gilbert too! Kyle as well! You all did well!!"

<b>

Cedric Meyer approached the four and expressed his gratitude.

The reason the frontline is still holding is because of these three.

Thanks to their efforts in repelling the large undead, the pressure from the enemy has significantly weakened.

If they hadn't been with them, what would have happened... just thinking about it makes cold sweat break out.

<b>

"Well, they're fast and have high attack power, but they're fragile when struck. We can handle them."

<b>

As Conrad said this, glancing sideways at Howard, Howard shrugged in agreement.

Watching this, Kyle thought to himself that it was because Lord Cloud and the others could say such things... and he smiled wryly, rising to his feet.

<b>

"Captain! The enemy is retreating!"

<b>

Cornell's voice echoed from the front lines.

<b>

"Tch! ...They're playing with us."

<b>

Conrad spat out his words with annoyance.

Meyer made a grim face, as if to agree with Conrad's sentiment.

<b>

In reality, their attack patterns thus far hardly seemed like they were trying to annihilate them.

<b>

While a few non-combatants had fallen victim during the initial chaotic battle, after regaining their formation, they had maintained a nearly equal state since then.

<b>

"When they show signs of pulling back, they surround us from the sides, but when we prepare to meet them head-on, they charge straight at us from the front...”

<b>

They're definitely playing with us! Conrad spat out his words again, throwing the water bottle he had been drinking toward Howard.

Howard caught it with one hand and quenched his own thirst.

<b>

The sun had already set, and as the dim light spread, several purifying glows rose around the deployed camp, surrounding it.

It was the "Sanctum Barrier" created by the holy classes within the knight squad.

<b>

The sanctum deployed by the holy priests was originally meant to repel the unclean undead and provide a divine glow that was effective against them.

However, it was hard to expect much effect against such a large horde of undead.

What good would it do to throw a bucket of water on a raging inferno? It was like pouring water on a burning stone.

<b>

<b>

Even so, if the enemy was beginning to retreat now, reducing the pressure, it might provide some breathing room.

At the very least, the Solid Squad holding the front phalanx needed to be relieved for rest.

Fred was currently preparing to establish a defensive position, and once that was done, a temporary break would be possible.

This was undoubtedly a war of attrition. Preserving stamina was the key to everything.

A war of attrition against a horde of undead was one of the most unfavorable situations imaginable...

Meyer grimaced self-deprecatingly before issuing orders to the squad to prepare for the next assault.

<b>

<b>

"...Has Casey... successfully reached Amkam?"

<b>

Tony Easton, sitting beside Conrad, asked while trying to catch his breath.

His helmet was removed from the back of his head, as if it was hindering his breathing.

<b>

"Of course... if it's him, he will."

<b>

Howard replied, gazing at the undead still surging like rough waves, albeit in reduced numbers.

<b>

"But! To return alone along the path we've taken?! It's hard to believe he could get through without incident...!"

"Well, the magical beasts will probably attack him as expected..."

<b>

Conrad answered as if it were obvious to Tony's words.

<b>

"If you know that...! Then we should have sent at least two more... no! A whole team with him!"

"Do you think we could have sent a whole team through in that situation? Remember!"

"Regulus knows the forest inside and out... and he will definitely make it back to the village."

"That's what I'm saying! Or are you saying you don't trust Casey, the one you sent alone?"

"That's not it! He's one of the mobile heavy knights! There's no way he could easily fall behind the magical beasts!"

"Then it's fine, isn't it?"

"But!"

"Have faith... either way, all you can do now is that, right?"

<b>

Conrad's words silenced Tony.

<b>

"Calm down, Tony... you’re injured, aren't you? Show me your side."

"What? Ah... is that so?"

<b>

A member of the medical team approached and knelt beside the seated Tony.

<b>

"You have two broken ribs, you know? Didn't you notice?"

"Oh... I see."

"It can't be helped... Alright, you're fine now, I've already patched you up."

"...Ah, I'm sorry, Lisa. Thanks for that."

<b>

"…Hmm, that's impressive."

"Lisa is our excellent high priestess."

<b>

As they admired the soft glow of healing light, Howard praised, and Meyer responded proudly.

<b>

Lisa Tuttle, the squad leader of the medical team, was one of the four holy classes in this battalion.

Her attire as a holy class was somewhat different from that of the other knights who took on the front lines.

<b>

The equipment for magic users is generally composed of robes based on high magical efficiency.

Over the robe, there are breastplates, shoulder guards, and waist guards.

<b>

Lisa's robe was not a plain, rugged garment.

From the long robe with slits, feminine, supple thighs peeked out.

The fabric covering her legs was a purifying blue velvet, and the edges and insides of the fabric were intricately embroidered with mithril gold and silver threads.

As a result, the magical efficiency and the resistance to magic and physical attacks gained from wrapping oneself in magic power were far superior to poorly made magical gear made from magical beast leather.

<b>

Like many priests, she was equipped with a round shield and a mace.

Now, like Kyle and Tony, she had removed her helmet, her left hand's shield secured to her arm, and her mace stored in a holster at her waist, freeing her hands to provide healing to those in need.

<b>

Many, like Tony now, were so caught up in the exhilaration of battle that they were unaware of their injuries.

If they resumed fighting like that, it could lead to irreparable consequences.

Now that the battle situation was stabilizing, she was looking around for such individuals to perform maintenance on them.

<b>

After finishing Tony's treatment, Lisa turned to Kyle, shaking her short black bob slightly...

<b>

"You seem... to be alright, Lieutenant. As expected."

"It's a shame I can't receive your love on this body..."

<b>

Kyle Urban stood up gracefully and smiled at Lisa as he said this.

Lisa blinked her large black eyes in surprise at Kyle's words...

<b>

"Oh? It's not my love you're receiving, but the love of the gods, you know? When did Kyle become so devout?"

<b>

She said in surprise, bursting into laughter.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"It was quite a task to remove the fallen trees, so I just reinforced it and set up the tent."

<b>

Fred Rolling, the logistics team maintenance chief, said nonchalantly.

<b>

The place Howard was guided to resembled a small fortress rather than a defensive position.

It seemed they had also used the fallen trees from the initial battle, but Howard was impressed by how quickly the logistics team had put this together in just about an hour.

<b>

The horde of undead that had surged like rough waves had now retreated like a receding tide, and the earlier chaos seemed like a lie as the area calmed down.

Even so, a dozen or so undead still peeked at them, ready to attack at any moment, leading to sporadic skirmishes.

<b>

Using the fallen trees around the tent, they had built a fence, and inside that, they had constructed a wall about two meters high.

It was said to be made of the earth attribute "Earth Wall."

The logistics team's skill in construction was high, and the wall was surprisingly thick and sturdy.

<b>

By incorporating the "sanctified" medals engraved with the temple's emblem, the holy classes aimed to turn it into a "holy object" to prevent the undead from invading.

Indeed, with this, even low-tier undead would be purified just by touching it, let alone approaching.

<b>

However, if a large horde like the previous assault surged, it would be quickly overwhelmed like a tidal wave, rendering it meaningless.

...Even so, it would be sufficient for a temporary reprieve.

For a temporary reprieve... Cedric Meyer deepened the furrow in his brow.

<b>

"Captain, the reconnaissance team has returned."

<b>

Norman Lance, the squad leader of the 4th squad, opened the tent flap while still holding his spear axe and called out.

<b>

More than an hour had passed since Howard and the others had driven away the large undead.

The depths of the forest, where even the stars were not visible, were already shrouded in darkness, with only the glow of the "Sanctum Barrier" illuminating the area, making it stand out against the pitch-black surroundings.

<b>

What Norman reported was that the reconnaissance team had returned just as the undead assaults began to show signs of settling down.

<b>

Inside the tent that had been set up, the main figures of the expedition team had gathered in the largest one.

The four squad leaders of the knight squad, Howard and Conrad as observers from Amkam, the three doctors, and the expedition leader Connor Clark.

<b>

At the table placed in the center of the tent were Captain Cedric Meyer and Lieutenant Kyle Urban, surrounded by the 3rd squad leader Tony Easton, the 5th squad leader Lisa Tuttle, and the 6th squad leader Cornell Warlich. Norman Lance, the 4th squad leader, entered to announce the arrival of the reconnaissance team.

<b>

"Thank you for waiting, Captain. We have just returned."

<b>

Following Norman, Magritte Gauche, the leader of the reconnaissance team, along with 1st squad leader Simon Reitzman and 2nd squad leader Lysa Ulunova, came in.

<b>

Originally, the 1st and 2nd squads, which had served as the advance units, were composed of members with high scouting abilities.

The reconnaissance was conducted by selecting five from among them, along with the two squad leaders and the team leader Magritte, splitting into two groups to head east and west.

<b>

"As Lord Cloud mentioned, the 'Black Rock' is located approximately 700 meters north of here, stretching east and west."

<b>

Once Magritte confirmed that everyone was gathered around the table, he began his report while running his finger over the map of Iloshio spread out on it.

<b>

"What's strange is that even after advancing 200 to 300 meters to the west or east from here, we haven't encountered any magical beasts at all."

"As we approach the 'Black Rock,' the vegetation visibly decreases. The area within a radius of about 100 meters from the 'Black Rock' is completely devoid of plant life. It's a black wasteland."

<b>

When Lysa reported that they had not encountered any magical beasts in this area, Simon reported the abnormalities surrounding the Black Rock.

<b>

"In conclusion, the enemy is coming from the 'Black Rock.' There are cracks like fissures in the 'Black Rock,' and they are emerging from there. The main force is likely on the other side. Currently, there are approximately 6,000 enemies on this side..."

"What the hell is that?! Where did the 2,000 go?!"

"Probably, they are continuously pouring out from the other side of the Black Rock..."

<b>

Magritte's report caused Tony to exclaim in surprise, to which Lysa responded.

<b>

"The width of the fissure is believed to be over 5 meters. We have successfully visually confirmed the appearance of large undead emerging from there."

<b>

At Simon's report, the tent buzzed for a moment.

<b>

"This time, we refrained from climbing the exposed 'Black Rock' due to the lack of bushes, as it would compromise our stealth. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm what lies beyond the 'Black Rock.' I apologize for that."

"No, Magritte, that's sufficient. You returned safely without any losses, which is a great achievement."

<b>

As Magritte bowed his head, Cedric praised the three for their sufficient results.

<b>

"Climbing the bare rock face of the 'Black Rock' without any bushes? That's a joke, right? And there were no fissures in the 'Black Rock' before!"

<b>

Conrad voiced his doubts at that.

The "Black Rock" Conrad knew had sparse vegetation but was firmly rooted.

At the very least, it was not a bald mountain with exposed rock faces. Howard nodded in agreement.

<b>

<b>

"That's because the crust has shifted."

"Dr. Morris?"

"This 'Black Rock' is... a vein of manulite, isn't it?"

<b>

Morris Balthasar, a structural geologist, raised his voice.

Everyone turned their gaze to Morris in unison.

<b>

"I mentioned earlier that there has been a noticeable presence of black rock in the geology around here for some time. I said today afternoon that it was a geology containing manulite."

"That's right! So, I'm not at fault!!"

"Calm down, Deputy Clark. No one is saying that you are at fault."

"Well, it’s true that when I mentioned that the refined high-purity material is more expensive than gold of the same weight, their eyes changed color!"

"Morris, please!"

"Then what's wrong with that?! If one knows there is a national benefit, it is only natural for those serving the country to seek it!!"

<b>

As Clark raised his voice, looking around in agitation, Cedric Meyer admonished him.

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was just under 2 kilometers to the 'Black Rock,' and it was around 3 PM.

Initially, the plan was to set up camp on that hill and establish a supply base.

However, just as they were about to begin setting up the base, Clark became interested in Morris's words regarding the geology of the land.

<b>

Morris stated that the black geology seen in this area contains "manulite."

"Manulite" is a mineral with high magical properties, and if it is refined and purified, it is more valuable than gold of the same weight.

Given the flow of magic, it is highly likely that this area contains a lot of "manulite," and the "Black Rock" they are aiming for is undoubtedly a vein of "manulite" exposed on the surface.

From that hill, the "Black Rock," which stretches east and west about 2 kilometers away, could be seen through the trees. Morris had been measuring it with his goggles as he spoke.

<b>

Upon hearing this, Clark became excited.

If they established a supply base here, he would be relieved of his duties and could return from here.

While it was a long-awaited moment for him, it was also an unbearable fact.

How could he leave when there was a mountain of treasure right in front of him?

If they could set up a supply base at the vein and arrange for mining from there, how much honor could he gain?

If he could achieve that, all his past hardships would be rewarded...

For Connor Clark, there was no option to turn back here.

<b>

Clark halted the knights who were beginning to set up the supply base. He immediately insisted on heading toward the "Black Rock."

<b>

Captain Cedric Meyer and logistics chief Fred Rolling attempted to persuade him that it was a reckless act.

While it might be slightly faster to march down the gentle slope from here to the "Black Rock," they knew that in another two hours, the sun would begin to set. After that, setting up camp would be difficult, let alone advancing. Clark should know how dangerous that was in this area.

They carefully explained the advantages of establishing a supply base at this elevated location and tried to persuade him to reconsider the advance.

<b>

However, Clark stubbornly refused, and the advance continued, resulting in an encounter with the undead.

<b>

"Deputy Clark, please calm down. You understand, don't you?"

"That's right. Sooner or later, we would have clashed with them. It's no one's fault."

"But we were attacked after ignoring the planned camping site and advancing significantly. Both horses and men were already exhausted."

"...Conrad!"

"I... am not at fault! ...I am...!"

<b>

When Howard said that it was unavoidable, Conrad mocked him.

Clark's voice gradually grew quieter, and there was no one in his line of sight.

<b>

<b>

"So, Dr. Morris, is there any connection between the fissures in the 'Black Rock' and the current situation?"

"There were already several signs of geological shifts before we arrived... due to the impact of the great disturbance, there may have been movements in the crust, or perhaps both."

<b>

Cedric asked Morris again, as if to reset the discussion.

Morris responded and continued his analysis.

<b>

"Manulite is a mineral with high magical absorption and fluidity. If there are large-scale veins connected, it would explain the rapid flow of magic in this area, wouldn't it? The recent great disturbance likely exposed the veins to a sudden torrent of magic, causing the 'Black Rock' fissures."

"Hmm, so we can infer that the fissures have released a vast amount of magic, creating a large reservoir of magical energy."

"Dr. Seiwashi..."

<b>

Seiwashi Melchio, a magical dynamics researcher, began to speak, continuing Morris's analysis.

<b>

"Hmm, a large reservoir of magical energy is prone to transform into miasma. The death of the vegetation around the 'Black Rock' indicates the emergence of miasma."

<b>

However... he continued speaking.

<b>

"Hmm, but it's hard to believe that it could naturally turn into miasma in such a short period..."

"Then is there some other factor at play?"

<b>

At Cedric's question, Seiwashi looked at Nosori.

<b>

"There are a few characteristics of naturally occurring undead."

<b>

Instead of Seiwashi, now Nosori Kasbar, a magical biology expert, took over.

<b>

"When they first emerge, they cannot move from that spot. This is because the 'memory' of that place shapes them, which is only natural."

"And there's another thing: they are manifestations of astral energies like grudges and emotions that have taken on physical form. So, they can be considered a type of magical life form, but since undead are technically dead, they are not living beings!"

<b>

This is outside my expertise! Uhyahyahya! he laughed with a strange voice, and Morris smacked him on the back of the head.

<b>

"Guoohhh! Guo! Morris! Are you trying to kill me?!"

<b>

"Well, that's fine! The manifested undead are formed from ether and astral energy... In other words, they create a core from magic, and if you scatter that, the undead can be defeated, which I believe everyone here understands?"

<b>

"Undead that have taken time to manifest will remain in the physical world for a while, even if their cores are scattered."

<b>

As Nosori exaggeratedly gestured while explaining, Morris remarked that he looked like he was on a roll! His blood vessels looked like they might burst!

"Shut up!" Nosori retorted, continuing his explanation.

<b>

"However! The enemies you are currently fighting will dissipate and return to the ether without delay when defeated! This is a characteristic of summoned undead!"

<b>

"Hmm, so we can deduce that someone is using the magical reservoir to create miasma and summon the undead."

<b>

A murmur spread through the tent at Seiwashi's words.

<b>

"Does that mean the enemy is a necromancer?!"

"That's absurd! Controlling this many undead exceeds human capabilities!"

"No, it doesn't have to be human. There could be a high-ranking undead among them."

<b>

Norman, Tony, Cornell, and the squad leaders voiced their doubts one after another.

Lisa placed her hand over her mouth and fell silent, contemplating the possibility of an undead summoner.

<b>

"In any case, it is certain that there are those who harbor hostile intentions toward us."

"...Lord Cloud."

"And... the 'Black Rock' is not a place where such beings should exist."

"Don't get too worked up, Conrad."

"I know, Howard. But if it comes down to it..."

"Ah, of course."

<b>

Howard and Conrad exchanged glances, confirming their intentions toward the enemy.

<b>

"We haven't visually confirmed the main enemy force, but I believe there are likely more of them than there are on our side..."

"How do you know that without seeing them?"

"When they gather in groups, I can see a faint phosphorescent glow. The one emitted from beyond the 'Black Rock' is incomparable to the ones here. There are definitely several times more."

<b>

At Lysa's words, Tony questioned her, but the basis of her statement caused a stir in the room.

<b>

"...That's impossible! Are you saying the enemy exceeds ten thousand?!"

<b>

Cornell of the Solid Squad blurted out.

<b>

"The strategy has been decided. We will retreat."

"But if we try to withdraw, they will encircle us. They won't let us escape easily."

"Don't worry, Conrad and I will hold them back. A thousand or two thousand weaklings are nothing to us."

"Haha! That's right! Leave it to us!"

"What are you saying?!"

"That's absurd!!"

"Lord Cloud!!"

<b>

As Howard and Conrad declared they would serve as a wall for the expedition team to retreat, Kyle, Tony, and Cedric raised their voices.

<b>

"You all should escape with them. Lord Meyer, fulfill your duty."

"Then I'll stay too."

"I will as well! Lord Conrad!"

<b>

Pointing at the three doctors and Clark, Howard stated that it was the knight's duty to protect those who could not fight.

However, Kyle and Tony stepped forward as well.

<b>

"Ah, I have a proposal regarding that matter..."

<b>

As they exchanged words, Morris raised his hand and stepped forward with a confident smile.

Thank you for reading!

<b>

I've been quite busy with real-life work lately, and my health hasn't been great, making it difficult to write as I would like~ (；Д；)

At this rate, will it take me about three months to accumulate five chapters?! That's what I've been thinking lately＠＠

<b>

I mentioned last time that there were about five chapters left, but it seems it will be about double that (confirmed)... oh dear.

<b>

So, for Chapter 2, I plan to change my posting style from now on and will not be uploading daily after accumulating chapters, but rather posting them in the order they are completed.

<b>

I appreciate your continued support even with this change in posting style.

I think I can post the next chapter sometime this week.

Thank you very much in advanceー<m(__)m>

<b>

Next time: "The Three Doctors of the North"
