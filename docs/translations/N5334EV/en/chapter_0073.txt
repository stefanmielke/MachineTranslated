# 68 Fierce Battle of the Mobile Heavy Knights

It has been a year since we started publishing.

Thank you all for your patience up to this point.

<blank>

I would like to continue to write until the end without any errors, so I would be very happy if you could bear with me until the end!

<blank>

I haven't finished writing at all yet, but I'm going to drop a story at ....... I'm going to drop a story here.

2 Red Moon 4, 18:40 PM

<blank>

The Solidarity Squad! Cornell! Block at all costs! Full phalanx intermittently activated! Hold them off!

<blank>

In the trees, as the sun was about to set and darkness was approaching, Cedric Meyer, who had just slashed the skull of a skull knight with his sword, through a gap in the hard line, and who had come down with a longsword with a chipped blade, raised his voice and sent out an instruction.

<blank>

Fred! Hurry up with the materials! Medic unit! Lisa! Maintain sanctuary deployment range! Let the wounded use the medical patches we have on hand to treat them, unless they're seriously injured! Know that the medic squad's magic is our lifeline!

<blank>

The slaughtered skull knight becomes a particle of light on the spot and disappears.

Cedric then sent out instructions to his troops, one after the other, and smashed the cranium of the undead that had once again overflowed.

<blank>

There were six of them holding large tower shields, known as "solidarity squads. They lined up side by side and built a wall.

There is an opening of more than two meters between the knight and the knight holding the shield, but a strong magical barrier is stretched between them.

<blank>

"Protectorate."

It is a strong barrier used by shield-equipped people.

A shield of magical power is deployed in a radius of approximately two meters around the shield held by the equipped person.

<blank>

A wall of magic deployed side by side in parallel activation is called a "full phalanx" and is more powerfully resistant to magic and physics.

It was momentarily pushing back even the hordes of undead that were surging in like wild waves.

<blank>

The main body of the knighthood is inside the wall, and the sanctuary of the Holy Order surrounds them as if to protect them.

The undead were avoiding that holy barrier, and the wave of attacks was concentrated on the phalanx in front of them.

<blank>

The solidarity team voices, timing, and repeats the parallel activation.

Many undead rush in at the breaks in the full phalanx, which is created in between the parallel activation and is like a breath-hold.

A hulking figure with horns on its forehead reaches out with half-rotted arms to drag the shield-bearer down through a gap in the momentarily thinning barrier.

The pig-faced lump of flesh peels its cloudy white eyes, gurgles and bubbles in the back of its throat, and twists its head in with a silent scream.

The main body of the knightly order, which is positioned in the rear of the solid column, disposes of the overflowing undead one after another.

<blank>

Some thrust with a spear-axe. Others strike with long swords and smash with battle-axes.

If he is a magician, he shoots flame bullets and arrows of light.

With their respective weapons, they were all fighting against the unceasing flow of immortal earth and stones.

<blank>

"Here they come! Large one in front, extra large two!"

<blank>

Cornell Wallich, the leader of Team 6, who was leading a solid formation in the front line and deploying a "protective formation," announced the approach of a peculiar enemy and shouted in a voice that was clear enough to be heard over the din of the battlefield.

<blank>

A huge skull stares at us from among the conifers, a grudge lit in the depths of its dark eye sockets.

A large skeleton steps forward with ease.

<blank>

From behind it, two white, band-like objects, alternately intersecting each other, also move toward this direction.

<blank>

Skull Sentipede."

It is approximately 20 meters long. Its body resembles a large, white-boned centipede, and its upper body is that of a giant skeleton. The vicious scythes in its hands, like mantis-like scythes, slice through its prey cruelly.

It is a fearless large undead with a threat value of 110.

<blank>

Howard steps forward to answer Cornell's cry.

<blank>

Kyle! The Great Skull is yours! Show them! Gilbert! Clear out the mooks around you! Conrad! Don't let him out of your sight!

Hi!"

I'll take care of it.

Haha! Don't be late! Howard!"

<blank>

The mass of undead surged like a white tsunami, and the soliders timed their movements to push open the mass, and the four jumped into the white muddy stream.

<blank>

Suddenly, the undead swarmed around them, but the next moment, the white bones and bloodless carrion of the undead broke off and scattered, just as a wave crashes against a rock face and turns into a white spray.

The undead are scattered and sink, as if they are being cut off from the grass on the prairie.

The mowing trails meander left and right, making their way through a forest of grass-like, white clumps.

<blank>

Gilberto, running through the streets, is quickly striking with his right-hand longsword and left-hand dagger, mowing down the undead one after the other.

In his presence, the hordes of the undead are no different than a grassy knoll as tall as he is.

<blank>

The eyepatch covering Gilbert's left eye, the magical markings on his leather armor, and his longsword and dagger glow ice green.

Pale green trails carved a path one after the other through the crowd of undead like waves of shimmering white.

<blank>

Two shadows pierce that path like cannonballs, widening it further.

<blank>

Anything in the straight line along which the shadows are moving will be hit by the shadows, shattering and scattering, and spreading out further into the space around them.

<blank>

One of the shadows effortlessly made it to the front of the target and roared at it.

<blank>

Hercules Howl.

<blank>

Conrad Burok's yell, which is filled with magical power, temporarily raises the muscle strength of his allies present, including himself, and also increases their concentration.

Furthermore, the magical power carried by the roar becomes a large ripple, and the opponent hit by the wave of magical power is temporarily inhibited from moving.

If it is a magic-powered opponent, the effect is remarkable.

The undead, powered by magic, stop moving for a moment at Conrad's cry.

<blank>

It is not Conrad who overlooks the gap.

Teeth bared, a ferocious grin on his face, he leapt to reap his prey.

Twisting himself, he squeezes his huge battle-axe to the right side, gathers his strength, and sprints toward his prey.

<blank>

Skull Sentipede's rigidity is instantaneous. It immediately raises both hands like a giant reaper's scythe toward the approaching Conrad.

<blank>

But for Conrad, that moment was enough. He was already in the bosom of his huge prey and fired the killing blow.

<blank>

Limit Axe Brow."

<blank>

The magic seal of the equipment shines in vermilion, and the extreme rage, dyed in the vermilion of rage, crushes huge enemies without hesitation.

The arms were raised and the rattled torso, the connection between the hundred-legged body and the skeleton's upper body, shattered and exploded.

<blank>

The white, rigid, distorted, fence-like upper body, which has lost its support, twists in the air and falls to the ground with the momentum of the shattering.

One-third of the hundred-foot body was also shattered by the impact.

As if in disbelief of what had happened to me, the eye sockets of the skull, which should have had no way to open, widened their darkness as if they were wide open.

<blank>

As soon as the falling body vibrates on the ground, Conrad strikes a follow-up blow.

<blank>

Meteofall."

<blank>

A red-hot blow, like the wrath of God, echoed through the earth with an immense impact, shattering a huge skull that resembled the figure of a man.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

The two scythes of the Skull Sentipede swung down from above toward Howard Cloud with great force.

Howard's light gray eyes snapped open and he stared at the distorted object formed of human bones ...... and its white blade that loomed before him.

<blank>

Howard, looking at the hard white blade as it swung down, swung the black greatsword in both hands with a "nun" spirit! with a "Nnnn!" spirit, Howard swung his black sword through the air, both hands gripping it.

The black great sword "Grand Divider" shines in the darkening space of the great forest, dyeing its huge black blade a pale, clean azure color.

<blank>

The blue lines drawn by the Grand Divider's swordstripe intersect with the two scythes of the Skull Sentipede as it is lowered.

At that moment, the scythe shattered and scattered as if it were made of candy or ice.

<blank>

The sudden loss of his own weapon caused the dark, supposedly mute fire within Skull Sentipede's eye socket to flicker with resentment.

At the same time, he roared in anger, shaking his skull at the puny little being who stood against him.

<blank>

The screams of the dead, the rage so palpable that the atmosphere shakes with them, are enough to rob the living of their sanity. But it does not reach Howard.

The skull-scentipede replaced its lost hands and opened its massive jaws to devour its prey, undulating its long body and plunging into its target.

<blank>

Howard held his greatsword next to his face so that he could point the tip at the enemy, and then he dropped to his haunches and twisted his body, saving his strength so that he could draw his bow.

Just as the huge jaws were about to bite Howard, the magic mark on Howard's equipment shone brightly.

From the shoulder strap, which looks like a flame, a blue radiance forms a line and flows through the arm to the great sword, where a large amount of magical power converges.

<blank>

Impact Brit."

<blank>

A roar echoed around the area, and the blow of the great sword, which became a blue shock, pierced and shattered the huge skull that was approaching.

The impact also penetrated most of the hundred-foot-like main body.

The object, fearlessly shaped with white bones, crumbled and scattered noisily in front of Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Looks like you took it down well too ...... Kyle?"

"I am safely vanquished, sir. Master."

Hah!" ...... hah! ...... hah! ...... Ji, Gilberto's ...... Oh, thanks ......!"

<blank>

Howard was questioning his neck as Kyle Irvine removed the helmet covering his head and collapsed in a heap, breathing hard.

<blank>

At first, Kyle was at the mercy of the Great Skull's speed and overwhelming durability, which belied its massive size.

However, with Gilbert's support, the Great Skull's tibia was destroyed, and when it lost its balance and fell, he cracked its head open and barely managed to finish it off.

The heavy-mobility magic armored storage device is completely empty, including its reserve.

For Kyle, this was a hard-fought victory that squeezed every ounce of strength and magic out of him.

<blank>

The Great Skull's head is awfully hard," he said. I cracked it open with some help! That's quite a feat!"

<blank>

Conrad was praising Kyle's success, quenching his thirst with a canteen he had received from a logistics corpsman.

<blank>

Thank you, Sir Cloud! Sir Conrad! And Gilbert! And Kyle, too! You did a great job!

<blank>

Cedric Meyer approached the four and thanked them.

It is because of the three of them that we are able to maintain the front line now.

Even now, thanks to the fact that we were able to repel the large undead, the pressure of the enemy's push has weakened considerably.

I wonder what would have happened if they had not accompanied me to ......, and just thinking about it makes me soak up a disgusting sweat.

<blank>

They're fast and aggressive, but fragile when you hit them. They can be anything.

<blank>

Hey, you know what?　Conrad said, looking at Howard with a sideways glance, and Howard cowered his shoulders.

Kyle, looking at it, could say so because it's Sir Cloud and his friends ...... and he smiled bitterly and muttered in a small voice as he raised his body.

<blank>

Battalion Chief! The enemy is retreating!"

<blank>

From the front came the cries of Cornell.

<blank>

'Tsk! They're playing with ......."

<blank>

Conrad spat the words abominably.

Meyer made a reluctant face as if to concur with Conrad's words.

<blank>

In fact, the way they have attacked us so far, it is hard to believe that they are trying to annihilate us.

<blank>

Although a few non-combatants were killed in the initial fierce melee, the battle remained mostly competitive after the formation was regrouped.

<blank>

If you show them that you are going to pull back, they will surround you to cover you, but if you are ready to meet them head on, they will just charge at you from the front. ......

<blank>

He's playing with me after all," Conrad said abhorrently again and threw his water bottle at Howard! Conrad spit out the word abhorrently again and threw the water bottle he was drinking at Howard.

Howard accepts it with one hand and clears his own throat.

<blank>

The sun was already setting and darkness was spreading.

It is a "sanctuary boundary" that depends on those who hold the holy office within the Order of the Knights.

<blank>

The sanctuary deployed by the priests is essentially a divine splendor that repels the unholy undead and gives them a special effect.

However, it is hard to imagine that the effect would be as great as left against such a large group of immortals.

How much good will a bucket of water do in the face of the onrushing fire? It is just water on a hot stone.

<blank>

<blank>

Still, if the enemy is now beginning to retreat and reduce the pressure that is pressing in, it will help to breathe somewhat.

At the very least, we need to give the hardened troops who put up phalanxes on the front lines a break from taking turns.

Fred is now preparing to build a defensive position, and once that is done, a temporary break will be possible.

This is definitely an endurance battle. Preservation of physical strength is the key that makes all the difference.

There is no such thing as an endurance battle against a horde of undead, though. ......

Meyer twisted his mouth in self-mockery, and then flew instructions to his troops to prepare for the next attack.

<blank>

<blank>

"Did ...... Casey, the ...... messenger, make it safely ...... to Amcam?"

<blank>

Tony Easton was sitting next to Conrad, catching his disordered breath and asking questions.

His helmet is off to the back of his head, perhaps in the way of catching his breath.

<blank>

Of course ......, he'd make sure of it."

<blank>

Howard answered, looking at the undead, who were fewer in number than before but still surging toward him like a wild wave.

<blank>

But! You're alone, retracing the path you've come so far? I can't ......, very ......, think I can get out of here without incident!"

Well, I guess the beasts will attack in that order. ......

<blank>

Conrad replies to Tony's words as if it were a matter of course.

<blank>

"If you know that, then you should have sent ......! You should have sent just one person ......, or at least two more ......, or even one team!"

'Could we have gotten one team out of that situation? Remember!"

Regulus knows his way around the forest. ...... and he will make it back to the village."

That's what I'm saying! Or what? You don't trust this Casey guy you let go alone?

No, he's not! He is one of the mobile heavy knights! He will not fall behind a hexenbiest so easily!

Well, that's good.

I'm at ......!"

Trust me, ......, either way, that's all you can do right now, right?"

<blank>

Tony shushed at Conrad's words.

<blank>

"Calm down Tony ......, you're hurt, aren't you? Let me see your side."

Huh?" Oh ...... is that so?"

<blank>

One of the medics approached Tony, who was sitting on his face, and got down on one knee.

<blank>

You have two broken ribs. Didn't you notice?"

Oh ......, yeah, right."

I can't help it. ......, hi, it's okay, I've already taken over."

I said, "...... Oh, smh, smh, Lisa. Thank God."

<blank>

...... Mm, it's stunning."

Lisa is our battalion's outstanding High Priestess."

<blank>

Meyer proudly responded to Howard's praise, which he announced while gazing at the pale, healing glow.

<blank>

Lisa Tuttle, the head of Team 5, who is also the head of the medical team, is one of only four people in this battalion with the rank of saint.

The attire of the Holy Orders differed somewhat from that of the other knights in charge of the vanguard.

<blank>

In general, the equipment of the magic profession consists of robes based on high magical efficiency.

It is in the form of a robe to which a breastplate, shoulder pads, waist pads, etc. are attached.

<blank>

The robes of Lisa's equipment are not ornate and martial.

Her long, slit robe peeks out from her feminine, supple thighs.

The robe covering her legs was a velvet of clean azure, with three-dimensional magical marks embroidered on the edges and inside of the fabric in mithril gold and silver thread.

Therefore, the high magic efficiency and the resistance to magic and physical power gained by being clothed in magic boasted much higher performance than magic equipment made from the leather of a poor magical beast.

<blank>

She, like many priests, is equipped with a round shield and mace.

Now she, like Kyle and Tony, had removed her helmet, her left shield was secured to the side of her arm, her mace was tucked into a holster at her waist, and both hands were free to heal those who needed it.

<blank>

Many, like Tony now, are so elated in the midst of battle that they are unaware that they are injured.

If the battle resumes as it is, it could be irreversible.

Now that the war is settling down, she is patrolling such men and maintaining them.

<blank>

After treating Tony, Lisa turned to Kyle with a small swing of her short black bob and .......

<blank>

You seem to be ...... all right, XO. That's what I'm talking about."

"I'm sorry I can't take your love in my body, though. ......

<blank>

Kyle Irvine tells Lisa as he stands up quickly and smiles at her.

Lisa's big black eyes fluttered for a moment at Kyle's words. ......

<blank>

Oh? It's not my love that you receive, but the love of the gods? When did Kyle become so religious?"

<blank>

He said in a surprised manner and started laughing colossally.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was too hard to remove the fallen trees, so we just reinforced them and put up the tent."

<blank>

Fred Loring, chief of maintenance for the logistics unit, said casually, "I'm not sure what you're talking about.

<blank>

Howard was led to a place where a fort-like structure, rather than a defensive position, had been built.

The trees that had been destroyed in the initial battle were also used, and Howard was amazed at the skill of the logistics team in completing this much in just an hour or so.

<blank>

The hordes of undead that had been surging in like wild waves have now receded like an undertow, and the area has calmed down as if the clamor that had just broken out had been a lie.

Still, sporadic fighting was taking place as a dozen or so undead peeked out at us and attacked at every opportunity.

<blank>

A fence was built around the tent using fallen trees, and a two-meter-high wall was also built inside the fence to enclose it.

It means that it was made by "earth wall" of earth attribute.

The logistics unit they had created was highly skilled, and the walls were surprisingly thick and sturdy.

<blank>

The priests would then incorporate a "consecrated" medallion with the temple's emblem engraved on it, making it a "holy artifact" that would prevent the undead from entering.

Certainly this would be so effective that a low-ranked undead would be purified just by touching it, let alone approaching it.

<blank>

However, if a swarm as large as the one that attacked earlier were to come in, it would quickly be swallowed up by the wave and turned into something meaningless.

...... Still, it is a good temporary respite.

Cedric Meyer's brow wrinkles deepened as he said, "I'm not sure I'd ...... be able to do that for a while.

<blank>

Battalion Chief, the reconnaissance team has returned.

<blank>

Norman Lance, leader of Team 4, opened the entrance to the tent with his spear axe and called out to us.

<blank>

More than an hour had already passed since Howard and his team had destroyed the large undead.

The abyss of the forest, where not even a star could be seen, was already enveloped in darkness, and only the radiance of the "sanctuary ward" made the camp appear as if it were cut out of the jet-black gloom.

<blank>

Norman reported that the unit he had entrusted to scout the area had returned just as the undead attacks were beginning to subside.

<blank>

The main members of the expedition were gathered in the largest of the tents that had just been set up.

They are the four squad leaders of the main body of the Order, the two and three doctors Howard and Conrad of Amcam as observers, and Connor Clark, the head of the expedition.

<blank>

At a table in the center of the tent, Battalion Commander Cedric Meyer and XO Kyle Irvine were surrounded by Squad 3 Commander Tony Easton, Squad 5 Commander Lisa Tuttle, and Squad 6 Commander Cornell Wallich. Then, Norman Lance, head of Team 4, announces the arrival of the reconnaissance team and enters the room.

<blank>

Sorry to keep you waiting, Battalion Chief. I'm back now."

<blank>

Norman was followed by Magritte Gauche with a scouting party, Djimon Rietzmann, head of Team 1, and Raisa Urnova, head of Team 2.

<blank>

Teams 1 and 2, which originally served as the advance units, are the teams with the best search-and-rescue capabilities.

The reconnaissance was carried out by dividing the eight men, five selected from among them, two squad leaders, and the unit leader, Magritte, into two groups, heading east and west.

<blank>

As Sir Cloud and others have said, the Black Rock is about 700 meters north of here, running east to west.

<blank>

After confirming that everyone was present around the table, Magritte began his report, running his fingers over the map of Irosio spread out on it.

<blank>

The strange thing is that even though we have gone two to three hundred meters west and east from here, no magical beasts have appeared at all.

The closer one gets to the "Black Rock," the more the vegetation is visibly decreasing. The space within a 100-meter radius of the Black Rock is completely devoid of vegetation. It is a black wasteland.

<blank>

Raisa told him that she had not encountered any magical beasts in the area, and Djimon reported anomalies around the black rocks.

<blank>

The bottom line is that the enemy is coming from the Black Rock. There is a crack in the black rock and they are coming out of it. The main force is probably on the other side of it. The enemy currently on this side of the black rock is ...... enemy is ............ about 6,000 ......"

Where are the 2,000? Where are those 2,000 numbers?

Maybe it's just coming from the other side of the black rock, more and more endlessly. ......

<blank>

Tony sounded surprised at Magritte's report, to which Raisa responded.

<blank>

We believe the rift is more than five meters wide. We have succeeded in visualizing a large undead creature emerging from the rift.

<blank>

Djimon's report caused a momentary stir in the tent.

<blank>

We did not climb all the way up Black Rock, which is a bare rock face with no bushes, in order to maintain secrecy. Unfortunately, we were not able to see the other side of the black rock. My apologies.

No, Magritte, that's enough. He came back well, without overdoing it."

<blank>

As Magritte bowed her head, Cedric congratulated the three of them for their labor, saying that it was a sufficient achievement with no losses.

<blank>

'Hard to ascend with no bushings? Are you kidding? Besides, there were no cracks in the Black Rock back in the day, were there?"

<blank>

Then Conrad raised a question.

The "Black Rock" that Conrad knew was sparsely populated, but the vegetation was still firmly rooted.

At least it wasn't just a bare rocky bald mountain. Howard nodded in agreement.

<blank>

<blank>

That's because the earth's crust has moved.

Dr. Morris?"

This 'black rock' is a vein of ...... manulite, right?"

<blank>

Morris Baltasar, a structural geologist, spoke up.

They all look at Morris at once.

<blank>

I told you this afternoon that the geology here contains manulite. I told you this afternoon that this geology contains manulite.

I'll tell you what," he said! So, that's why I'm! ...... I'm not a bad guy!

Calm down, Deputy Clark. No one is saying it's your fault.

Well, I bet your eyes changed color as soon as I told you that refined, high-purity gold is more expensive than gold of the same weight!

"Dr. Morris, ......!"

'Yes, so what's wrong with that? It's only natural for those who serve their country to see that there is a national interest and seek it!!!"

<blank>

Upset, Connor Clark shouted loudly while looking around at those around him. Cedric Meyer rebuked him.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It was less than two kilometers to "Kuroiwa" and the time was around 15:00.

The original plan was to set up a camp on that hill and use it as a supply base.

But just as they were about to begin setting up the base, Morris, who had been studying the geology of the land, ate into Clark's words.

<blank>

The black geology found here, Morris says, contains "manulite.

Manulite" is a mineral with high magical properties, and a high-quality product that has been refined and stripped of impurities is more expensive than gold of the same weight.

From the flow of magic power, there is a high possibility that this place contains a lot of "manulite," and the "black rock" that we are now aiming for is definitely a vein of "manulite" exposed on the surface of the earth.

Two kilometers from that hill, the "Black Rocks," which run east to west, could be seen through the trees. This was what Morris was telling us as he surveyed the area with his own goggles.

<blank>

Hearing this, Clark was colorful.

If I build a supply base here now, I'll be out of a job and will have to turn around and go back.

It was a time that I had been waiting for, but at the same time, it was a fact that I could not endure.

You have a mountain of treasure right in front of you, and you want me to walk away with my fingers in my mouth?

If we could build a supply base in the vein ahead and create a mining arrangement from there, how much honor would that bring?

If we get it, all this hard work will be worth it. ......

For Conor Clark, turning back was not an option.

<blank>

Clark waited for the Knights to begin setting up a supply base. He insisted that they leave immediately for "Black Rock.

<blank>

Battalion commander Cedric Meyer, logistics unit chief Fred Loring, and others tried to convince him that it was a reckless act.

From here to Kuroiwa, the march may be somewhat faster than before because of the gradual descent, but in another two hours the sun will begin to hide. Then it would be difficult to set up camp, let alone march. Even Clark knew how dangerous it would be in this area.

He carefully explained the advantages of setting up a supply base on this elevated site, and tried to persuade them not to march forward.

<blank>

However, Clark stubbornly refused to comply, and the march continued, resulting in a close encounter with the undead.

<blank>

Acting Clark, I know what you're doing, so please remain calm.

He said, "You're right. Sooner or later, we would have run into them. It's nobody's fault."

"But we were attacked so far ahead of the planned encampment that the horses and people were getting pretty beat up.

"...... Conrad!"

I'm ...... not ...... bad! ............ I am ......!"

<blank>

When Howard says it was inevitable, Conrad makes fun of it.

Clark's voice grew quieter and his gaze reflected no one.

<blank>

<blank>

So, Dr. Morris, what is the connection between the cracks in the 'Black Rock' and the current situation?"

We could see a number of strata shifts before we got here ......, either due to a cataclysmic event or crustal movement such as an earthquake ......, or perhaps both."

<blank>

Cedric asked Morris again, as if to reiterate.

Morris responded and continued his consideration.

<blank>

Manulite is a mineral with high absorbency and fluidity of magic power. If there is a series of large veins of manulite, it would explain the torrent-like flow of magic power in this area, wouldn't it? The veins exposed to the sudden torrent of magic power caused distortion, and the cracks in the black rock must be the result of the rupture.

"Well, I suppose that the rupture caused a massive outpouring of magical power, creating a large pool of magical energy.

Dr. Seiwasi, ......."

<blank>

Seiwashi Melchio of Magic Mechanics began to speak, as if to follow Morris's musings.

<blank>

"Well, large pools of magical power can easily turn into a miasma," he said. I think the death of plants around the black rock indicates the occurrence of a miasma.

<blank>

The likelihood is that ...... will continue the conversation.

<blank>

Hm, though it's hard to imagine a natural noxious agent turning into a noxious agent in such a short period of time. ......

So what other factors are at play?"

<blank>

What about Cedric's question? Seywash looks at Nosoli.

<blank>

The naturally occurring undead have a few characteristics.

<blank>

He was replaced by Seiwasi, who in turn was succeeded by Nosoli Kasbal, this time a magical biologist.

<blank>

It is said that you can't move from a place when it has just been hit. This is a matter of course, since it is formed by the 'memory' of the place.

There is one more thing. They are astral objects, such as grudges and passions, that have taken on ethereal bodies and materialized, so you could say that they are a form of magic-generating organisms.

<blank>

This is not my specialty! Nosoli laughs and yelps with laughter, but Morris punches him in the back of the head with his head!　Morris punches Nosoli in the back of the head with all his might.

<blank>

Gooooooooooooo! Goooh! Mr. Morris! You're going to kill me after all, aren't you?

<blank>

Well, that's all right! The embodied undead are ethereal and astral ......, that is, they form a nucleus with magical power, and I'm sure everyone here understands that dispersing this will destroy the undead, don't you?"

<blank>

Wreckage that materializes over time remains in this world for a while after the nucleus disperses.

<blank>

Morris seems to be on board as he watches Nosoli explain with exaggerated body language and hand gestures! I think I'm going to break a blood vessel, Mr. Nosoli!　I'm about to break a blood vessel, Mr. Nosoli!

You are so noisy," Nosoli replies!　Nosoli replied, and went on with his story.

<blank>

But..." "But..! The opponent you are fighting now, when defeated, will dissipate and return to the ether in no time! This is a characteristic of the summoned undead!

"Hm, so we can infer that something used a pool of magic to create a miasma, and then used it to summon the undead. That's the inference we can draw.

<blank>

At Seywasi's words, a stir spread through the tent.

<blank>

"You mean to tell me that the enemy is a necromancer?

Ridiculous! Controlling this many undead is beyond the realm of humans!"

No, it can't be human. Maybe there are higher-level undead out there."

Norman, Tony, Cornell, and the squad leaders all voice their doubts one after another.

Lisa put her hand over her mouth and pressed it shut, considering the possibility of an undead summoner.

<blank>

In any case, there is no doubt that there are people out there who are willing to turn against us.

...... cloud-sir."

Besides, ......, Black Rock is no place for them.

Don't do it, Conrad."

I know, Howard. But when push comes to shove, ......"

Yeah, of course.

<blank>

Howard and Conrad looked into each other's eyes to confirm their intentions toward the enemy.

<blank>

We haven't been able to see the main enemy force, but there are probably more of them than are on our side. ......

How do you know that if you don't have visibility?"

When they are in a group, you can see a slight phosphorescence. The light emitted from the other side of the black rock is incomparable to the light emitted by those on our side. It was definitely several times stronger.

Tony questioned Raisa's words, but the place was abuzz with the rationale she was describing.

<blank>

"...... idiot! Are you saying that the enemy is more than ten thousand?!"

<blank>

Cornell, a member of the solidarity squad, spills the beans.

<blank>

We've got a plan. We're going to make a run for it."

But if you try to retreat, they will come around you. They won't let you off the hook so easily."

No, I and Conrad will hold them back. We can handle a thousand or two thousand pieces of wood.

Haha! That's right! Well, I got it!"

What will they say?

Nonsense!

Sir Cloud!

Kyle, Tony, and Cedric spoke up to Howard and Conrad, who said they would be the wall for the survey team's withdrawal.

<blank>

You will take them and run while you are at it. Do your duty, Lord Meyer.

Then I'll stay, too."

I am, too! Mister Conrad!"

<blank>

Pointing with his eyes at the three doctors and Clark, Howard says it is the knight's duty to protect those who cannot fight.

But then Kyle and Tony step forward.

<blank>

Uh, I have a suggestion about that: ......."

<blank>

Morris, who had been watching the exchange, raised his hand and came forward with a wry smile on his face.

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

I've been very busy with real work lately, and my health has not been good, so I have not been able to write as much as I would like to.

I'm thinking that at this rate, it will take me about 3 months to finish writing 5 episodes! I think @@@@!

<blank>

I said last time that there would be about 5 more episodes, but it looks like it will be double that (to be confirmed). ......

<blank>

So, from now on, I will upload the two chapters in the order in which they were written, rather than writing them up and uploading them every day.

<blank>

I will be changing my posting style a bit, but I would be grateful if you could keep up with me.

I think I can drop the next episode this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.
