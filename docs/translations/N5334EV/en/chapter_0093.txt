# 81 On the Day of Departure

The red month of 4 is the time of year that corresponds to August in the original world. Although it is the end of August, the days are still hot.

The sky, which seems to have been dyed an azure blue, is endlessly wide, and the strong sunlight makes the colors of the world stand out even more.

<blank>

If you look to the east in the sky, you can see a large cumulonimbus cloud rising from far offshore of Oceanus, even here in Copetown, as if it is rising with several large shaved heads poking together.

<blank>

Under such a summer sky, the wind that gently caresses your cheeks brings the bustle of the town along with the smell of summer warmed by the sunlight.

The sound of horses' hooves pounding on the cobblestones, wheels turning, and carriages creaking echoed everywhere.

<blank>

This is the stagecoach boarding area, placed at the north end of Main Street in Copetown.

<blank>

The boarding area was a step higher than the cobblestone road surface, where a single wooden bench was placed for those waiting for the carriage.

There is a bit of a crowd in front of that bench right now to see off those who are leaving for Dekenbel.

Perhaps never before had the boarding area been as noisy as it was that day.

<blank>

The five children are headed to De Kembel.

There were three girls, myself, Mia, and Bibi, and two boys, Irving and Lombardo.

<blank>

All five are dressed in brand new uniforms from the Milia Castel Eye boarding school.

<blank>

Our girls' uniform skirts are tartan carmine with high-waisted corset skirts that go all the way down to the chest. The six brass buttons on the front are the key to the look.

The large ribbon tie around the neck is also cute, in a matching red color with the skirt.

The powder pink blouse that matches that cute tie is summer wear, so it has short sleeves, but the shoulders are puffy, and there is a ruffle at the bust, which is also very lovely.

In winter, they will match this with a cape benning.

Since it's summer now, I only have a Polar Hat on my head, which has a lovely rounded shape.

<blank>

The boys were wearing slacks and white shirts with string ties in the same color as ours. As one would expect, the boys' uniforms are much less decorative than the girls', but the shirts are made of a lot of fabric and are tucked in a lot.

Lombard looks 10% more dignified just because he's wearing a uniform, and Irving looks kind of cool, too, you know? Even though he is Irving!

A little Bibi! I'm not glancing at you with such a passionate eye! If you're going to start a romantic comedy, do it in a public place, okay?

<blank>

<blank>

Now, at this stop, families are gathering to see us off on our journey.

Richard and Nora of the Matthieson family. Ms. Silence and Mr. Jane of the Kroki family. Harry and Erma of the Haggard family. Mr. Harrison and Ms. Stella of the Brooke family. Aria, Lombardo's sister, and Ryder, Irving's brother, are not here because they have to work. I don't think of them as thin-skinned or anything, though, not really!

...... and of course, Howard and Sonia are here.

Everyone is saying goodbye to their respective families and receiving their blessings for their departure.

<blank>

Many of the underclassmen who had spent time together at school had also gathered to see us off.

I hugged Helena and Mary, the underclassmen, and said goodbye to them, holding back the tears that threatened to seep out. Then, before getting into the carriage, I turned to Howard Papa and Sonia Mama again to greet them for their departure. ......

<blank>

As I stared at the faces of the two men, something suddenly surged up inside me, and in an instant, my rationality was violently shattered!

Pulling and quivering my lips, the emotions that overflowed in the form of large tears and sobs burst out of me.

<blank>

I'm going to ......, after all! I still don't want to go to ......!

<blank>

I hugged Mama Sonia and burst into tears right then and there, and began to weep profusely.

Yes, the "unprecedented commotion" at the train station was caused by me crying so hard!

Seeing me crying, Mary and the other younger girls started crying loudly as if they were being dragged along, which made the adults cringe.

AnnaMarie later told me that Howard Papa seemed terribly upset.

<blank>

"Susie ....... You said last night that you're okay now."

But ......, but oh!"

I'm thinking, "...... no, no! If we just quit going, we'll just go to ......!"

Howard!

<blank>

Sonia-mama strokes my hair and speaks kindly to me.

Mom snapped back at Dad Howard, who interrupted her from the side.

<blank>

Suzy ......, it's okay Suzy. You're okay."

"mama...... mamaaa......"

Because you are our pride and joy!"

Ma, mama ......!"

We are family. We're always connected, everywhere. ...... Right? Susie."

<blank>

Mama Sonia is holding me close and gently stroking my hair.

Then, while hugging me tightly, he said in my ear, calmly, powerfully, and lovingly.

Mom's words quietly melted away the stuff in my chest.

I let out a tearful exhale as I hugged Sonia back tightly.

After rubbing our cheeks together and placing a gentle kiss on it, Sonia slowly moved away from my body and entrusted my body to AnnaMarie, who stood behind me with an entrusting look.

<blank>

AnnaMary. Please take care of Susie for me at ......, okay?"

You can count on me, ma'am.

<blank>

AnnaMarie, who was entrusted with me by SoniaMama, answered strongly while placing her hand on my shoulder.

Yes, besides the five of us, AnnaMarie will also go with us to the boarding school!

<blank>

The school was originally a high-class boarding school for the sons of aristocrats.

Even after the dismantling of the aristocratic system, some of the customs of those days remained, and it is said that when the children of former high-ranking aristocrats enter the school, they are required to be accompanied by someone to take care of their personal belongings.

I don't know what it is, but I am thankful for it.

The security of having AnnaMarie, my "family," with me barely fills my anxiety about being away from "home.

<blank>

...... soniamamaa."

Now, go on, Suzy. You're going to be just like you are over there.

............ mom."

<blank>

Sonia-mama looked at me with a quiet, resolute face. I met her gaze and nodded slowly.

<blank>

......, yes. I'm going...I'm coming! ......Howard Dad, Sonia Mom. ............ please ...... take care of yourself, please ...... take care of yourself!

<blank>

I straightened my posture, held back the tears that were welling up in my eyes, and finally spun out a few words to greet Howard and Sonia.

But the tears just kept pouring down my cheeks.

My vision is distorted with tears and my surroundings are blurred and I can't see straight.

<blank>

"......Kooo! Suzy!

<blank>

Howard's squeezed-out voice was the only thing that remained in my ears.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, Annameri, AnnaMarie! AnnaMary! Ah-an! Aaan! AnnaMerie!

It's all right, miss. I am here. I'll be with you in a moment."

Sue," she said! I'm here too ...... I'm here! It's okay!

A! Annamelliiiiiiiii!"

He's not listening to ......!"

"...... fu"

Damn it!"

<blank>

I clung to AnnaMarie in the carriage, burying my face in her lap and sobbing.

AnnaMarie is gently patting my head on her lap as if she is working on it, and talking to me to reassure me.

I thought I heard a sigh of regret from Mia, who was sitting between me and AnnaMarie. ...... was it my imagination?

<blank>

But it's surprising, isn't it? I didn't expect Susie to cry so much. I thought she would be more unconcerned."

...... Yeah, I can't imagine that from the usual Susie."

<blank>

Shut up boys!

What did Irving and Lombardo think of me? They have some kind of selfish evaluation of me.

I am very delicate! That's what crass men don't understand!

<blank>

I thought I'd seen it all coming! It was pretty much as I expected! I knew it was going to be like that from the very beginning! I knew she was going to cry a lot!

<blank>

Kuh! That's what I'm talking about, Bibi! I'll just say it here!

<blank>

You said, "...... I know, right? You ...... knew that, didn't you? I knew it, and I had plenty of handkerchiefs ready to ...... you!"

It's all right. I will take care of everything. There is no need for you to bother me, Mia-sama.

GnuNuNu......"

<blank>

I still think I hear Mia moaning, you know?

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Dekenbel, where we are now heading, is located about 1,200 kilometers north of the royal city of Meridies, and is the largest regional city in the north with a population of over 200,000 people.

It is approximately 300 kilometers in a straight line from Copetown, which is also the gateway to Amcom County.

In fact, it is said that the journey is more than 350 kilometers, as it avoids mountains and valleys along the way.

<blank>

He said that when the Knights came to Amcam last year, they came that way in seven days.

Since it was a large group of more than 100 people, the distance that would normally have taken 10 days to cover was done in about seven days, so it must have been quite a strenuous march.

<blank>

But this stagecoach we are using now is much more light on its feet.

I was told that this carriage is a "special express train".

I'm assuming you mean "express"? I feel like it's something a little different from what I know. ......

So they say it is much faster than a regular stagecoach.

However, the distance they can travel in a day is only about 100 kilometers, as they stop at towns along the way.

We would travel by horse-drawn carriage for three and a half days to De Kembel.

<blank>

<blank>

The streets are paved with paving stones, so the carriage ride is not bad.

However, there are still many unpaved roads away from the city and into the wilderness.

Still, they do not need to worry that much about the comfort of the ride because of the good performance of this carriage itself.

<blank>

The carriage in which we ride is a big one with a capacity of 12 passengers.

The horses are four-horse team, with the gyoji and his two assistants seated in the gyoji's seat.

The entire exterior is black and decorated in places, but it is said to be built robustly to withstand long-distance travel.

Our luggage is strapped to the roof of the vehicle, and anything large enough to be handheld is placed under the seats.

The interior is made of ebony and the decor is soothing.

The chairs are upholstered in red leather and are reasonably resilient, and the vibrations do not affect me as much as I had expected, but if I sit in them for long periods of time, my buttocks are sure to accumulate damage.

However, it is said that there are several soft cushions in the car for such people.

<blank>

We spent three and a half days traveling in this carriage (......), and of course there were other passengers on board besides the six of us.

When we were leaving Copetown, and even now, I realized that I was making an ugly scene in the carriage as we approached a mountain pass just before Masom, and I hurriedly adjusted my appearance, but I was well aware that it would all be over later!

I can't help it now that I've come this far under the warm and fuzzy gaze of the other guests, you know?

<blank>

<blank>

The pass before Masom is a time-consuming climb with many turns and turns.

The distance between Copetown and Masom is about six kilometers in a straight line, but it takes nearly an hour to cross this pass.

Howard Papa had told me before that this 200-meter-high mountain pass has a long east-west stretch of peaks that form a natural fortress wall.

It is obvious to those who live in Amkam what the pass is a barrier against.

The people of Amkham have spent a long time believing that the overflow of Irosio should never be allowed to exceed it.

<blank>

<blank>

After climbing the pass and arriving at its summit, we found ourselves in a small clearing.

It is said to be a resting place for horses that have climbed the mountain pass and are exhausted.

A horse trough filled with water was placed there, and the water, drawn from somewhere, made a cool, refreshing sound.

<blank>

The small resting place also served as a lookout point for the pass, and when I opened the window from my parked carriage, I could see far into the distance the road we had climbed, undulating through the fresh greenery, and the land that stretched out beyond.

The large walled town a short distance ahead is Copetown, which we had just left a short while ago.

It stretches 4 to 5 kilometers across from east to west and provides a good view of the wall that surrounds the town.

The main street running through the center of town and the large spire standing to the left of it are also clearly visible.

The white-roofed temple bell tower is the largest building in the city.

On the other side of the street should be Marsh's workshop and further back should be Cecily's "Late Afternoon".

As one would expect, you can't even see the store from here.

But even from here, it is easy to see the many stores of all sizes lining the boulevard and the many people passing through the streets.

<blank>

If you raise your gaze a little from there, the land further to the north expands and stretches, and your eyes naturally see the landscape beyond.

With the white deipara in the far distance in the haze behind it, at the foot of it, the land has been cleared to encompass the deep forest that stretches out from the horizon.

That is our village, Amkam.

<blank>

I can feel something rising in my chest again, thinking that just a couple of hours ago, I was still in that place.

Even from this distance, the Amcam House makes its presence felt and stands proudly in the center of the village, reminding us once again that this is indeed the pride of the village.

The school is located in a green area a little to the right of the Amcam House.

You can't see it because it's hollowed out, but there should be a small bridge in that area between the school and the Amcam House where we all used to cool off and chase the little fish.

And, beyond the Amcam House, you can see a little overlap, but I'm pretty sure that's that old tree on the high ground over there.

And between that old tree and the AMCAM house is Bibi's home, the Kuroki mansion, and from there, facing west, is the "Kuroki Boulevard," a row of poplar trees that now stand tall and stately with lush foliage.

And ...... and if you go south down the road at the end of that row of trees, you'll see ....... Yes, it must be that windbreak, there ......, oh, you can see the green roof! Small, faint, though! A beautiful green gable! There's ...... there!

<blank>

"...... ah, ah, ............ ah, ah!"

<blank>

That was the limit there.

The faces of Mom Sonia and Dad Howard came to mind, and that alone brought tears to my eyes and distorted my vision.

<blank>

'Hi, ah, ah, ah , ah! ...... Oooh, ah, ah, ah ......, ah! ............ ah-bwoon?!"

<blank>

Just when my lacrimal gland was about to break down and tears were about to overflow like a flood. ......

<blank>

He turned his body in a circle and his face was covered with soft objects.

It was so soft that one could almost hear the onomatopoeic sound of "pohuhn♪," an incredibly comforting sensation.

<blank>

"Puh-puh! Puha......, hummm? Ng, ami nyu myu myu ............"

"Sue-chan, ......, if you want to cry, you can always go to ...... and cry here, okay? See? ......nn"

<blank>

Immediately, I lifted my hands to the height of the object that buried my face, and pulled the soft mass up repeatedly so that it was between my face and the object.

With a puff-puff-puff♪ sound, the face is enveloped and buried in marshmallow-like softness.

<blank>

It was Mia!

......No, I knew that. ......

I was now being held up by Mia's overwhelming chest strength!

<blank>

The force has continued to grow since we first met, and as of now, we have been informed that it has finally reached "H". And they are still growing. ...... I'm amazed!

In addition, Mia's mother and grandmother were not of ordinary strength. This is a blood or thoroughbred kind of thing. ...... Oh, I'm afraid!

Moreover, neither of you even seems to have succumbed to gravity!

I heard that there is something about a secret or secret technique of the Mathisons, or something like that. ...... Fear not! The Mathisons!

<blank>

In addition, the uniform we are wearing now is high-waisted and goes down to the chest. Therefore, our chests are emphasized even if we don't want them to be.

This is a horrible thing that no matter how small Bibi's chest is, it will be visible in its own way. ......

...... Did you just feel a piercing look in the back of your head? ...... You're a man with good instincts!

This is why! Wearing this uniform, Mia has become more evil than ever!

<blank>

There was no way I was going to be safe and sound when I was pushed there. ......

It is not unreasonable to just rub it in and go bury it!

<blank>

"......Munyu, Myu......nmu, NyumyuNyumyu............"

'♡nf......n. ......ffffff."

Nu......ck!"

<blank>

I can hear Mia's happy voice as she strokes my buried head.

I thought I heard a frustrated moan from behind me, this time from AnnaMarie, but ...... I wondered why?

<blank>

I also thought I heard Irving and Lombardo coughing shyly out of the corner of my eye and Bibi sighing loudly in exasperation from the seat across from me, but I paid no mind to any of that!

<blank>

Soon the carriage began to move, and a pleasant vibration was felt in the seat.

We should be in Masom in less than another half hour, but until then, let's stay buried like this: .......

There is nothing that can resist this sinking feeling! This is the spoiled meat that ruins people!

I was absorbed in the feeling of the cat's paws on the soft cushions and other soft objects.

The anxiety that had been present until just before the event was enveloped in marshmallow healing, as if it had never happened.

<blank>

"myu...... mufu♪ufu...... nyu nyu nyu nyu ......"

<blank>

The time of prodigal bliss was far from over!
