# Chapter 81: On the Day of Departure

The fourth month of the red moon corresponds to August in the original world. Although it's the end of the month, hot days continue.

The sky, dyed in deep azure, stretches wide, and the strong sunlight accentuates the colors of the world even more.

<b>

Shifting my gaze to the east of the sky, I can see towering cumulonimbus clouds, resembling large monk heads, rising far offshore from the Oceano, visible even from here in Coop Town.

<b>

Under such a summer sky, the wind gently caresses my cheeks, bringing with it the scent of summer warmed by the sunlight, along with the hustle and bustle of the town.

The sound of horse hooves striking the cobblestones and the creaking of wheels from carriages echoes everywhere.

<b>

This is the boarding area for the stagecoach located at the northern end of Coop Town's main street.

<b>

The boarding area is elevated one step above the cobblestone surface, with a wooden bench placed there for those waiting for the carriage.

In front of that bench, a small crowd has gathered to see off those departing for Dekkenbel.

Perhaps there has never been a day as noisy as this at the boarding area?

<b>

Heading to Dekkenbel are five children.

Me, Mia, and Vivi, the three girls, along with two boys, Arvin and Lombard.

<b>

All five of us are dressed in brand new uniforms from the Miriacastle Eye boarding school.

<b>

Our girls' uniforms feature a high-waisted corset skirt in tartan check carmine, reaching just below the chest. The six brass buttons on the front are a nice touch, right?

The large ribbon tie at the neck is also a cute matching red color.

The powder pink blouse that pairs with that cute tie has short sleeves since it's summer, but the shoulders puff out gently, and there's frill at the chest, making it very adorable.

In winter, we will wear a Cape Benning with this.

Since it's summer now, I only have a cute rounded polar hat on my head.

<b>

The boys wear slacks and white shirts, with ties in the same color as ours. Compared to the girls' uniforms, the boys' uniforms are much less decorative, but the shirts use plenty of fabric and have many tucks, making them somewhat cool?

Just wearing the uniform makes Lombard look a bit more gallant, and Arvin seems to look cool too! Even though he's Arvin!!

Hey, Vivi! Don't give me those heated glances! If you're going to create some rom-com situation, do it where no one can see, okay?!!

<b>

<b>

Now at this station, each of our families has gathered to see us off on our journey.

Richard and Nora from the Mathison family. Silence and Jane from the Croki family. Harry and Elma from the Haggard family. Harrison and Stella from the Blouck family. Lombard's older sister Aria and Arvin's older brother Ryder are not here because they have work. Not that I think they're heartless or anything!

...And of course, Papa Howard and Mama Sonia are here.

Everyone is cherishing their farewells with their families and blessing our departure.

<b>

Many younger students who spent time with us at school have also gathered to see us off.

I held back tears as I hugged Helena and the younger students, bidding them farewell. Before boarding the carriage, I turned to face Papa Howard and Mama Sonia to say goodbye...

<b>

As I stared intently at their faces, trying to imprint them in my memory, something surged up within me, and in an instant, it overwhelmed my reason!

Trembling lips released a flood of emotions in the form of large tears and sobs.

<b>

“...I-I really...! I really don’t want to go...!!!”

<b>

I clung to Mama Sonia, bursting into tears right there.

Yes, the “unprecedented noise” at the station was caused by my loud crying!!

Seeing me cry, the younger girls like Mary also began to cry loudly, causing the adults to panic.

Papa Howard seemed terribly flustered, as Anna Mary later told me.

<b>

“Suzy... You said you were okay last night, didn’t you?”

“But... but!!”

“...N-No! Why don’t you just give up on going altogether...!”

“Howard!!”

<b>

While gently stroking my hair, Mama Sonia spoke softly to me.

Papa Howard tried to interject, but Mama firmly silenced him.

<b>

“Suzy... It’s okay, Suzy. You’ll be okay.”

“Mom... Mom...”

“Because you are our pride and joy!”

“Mom...!”

“We are family. We are always connected, no matter when or where... right? Suzy?”

<b>

Mama Sonia held me close and gently stroked my hair.

Then, while embracing me tightly, she spoke softly and lovingly in my ear.

Her words quietly melted away what was building up in my chest.

With a tearful sigh, I hugged Mama Sonia back tightly.

After rubbing my cheek against hers and receiving a gentle kiss, Mama Sonia slowly released me and entrusted me to Anna Mary, who stood behind her with a look of care.

<b>

“Anna Mary. Please take care of Suzy, okay?”

“Leave it to me, ma’am.”

<b>

Anna Mary, entrusted with me by Mama Sonia, answered firmly while placing a hand on my shoulder.

Yes, along with the five of us, Anna Mary will also be going to the boarding school!

<b>

Apparently, the Miriacastle Eye boarding school was originally a prestigious school for noble sons.

Even after the dismantling of the nobility system, some customs from that time remain, and it seems there is a rule that when a child of a former high-ranking noble enrolls, they must bring someone to take care of them.

It’s a somewhat unclear rule, but I’m grateful for it now.

The presence of “family” like Anna Mary is just enough to fill the anxiety of leaving “home.”

<b>

“...Mama Sonia.”

“Now, go on, Suzy. Be yourself and do your best over there.”

“...Mama.”

<b>

Mama Sonia gazed at me with a calm, resolute expression. I met her gaze and slowly nodded.

<b>

“...Y-Yes. I will... go! ...Papa Howard, Mama Sonia. ...Please... please take care of yourselves!!”

<b>

I straightened my posture, held back the tears that were overflowing, and finally managed to say those words firmly to Papa Howard and Mama Sonia.

But tears continued to flow freely, wetting my cheeks.

My vision blurred with tears, making it hard to see around me.

<b>

“...Ugh! S-Suzy!!”

<b>

Only Papa Howard’s strained voice remained in my ears.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Ah, Anna Mary! Anna Mary! A-An! Aah! Anna Maryyy!!”

“It’s okay, my lady. I’m here. Just for a moment.”

“Su-chan! I’m here too... I’m here! It’s okay!!”

“A! Anna Maryyy!!”

“...It seems she’s not listening!”

“...Hmph.”

“Ugh!”

<b>

I clung to Anna Mary in the carriage, burying my face in her lap and sobbing.

Anna Mary gently stroked my head, comforting me with her voice.

I thought I heard a somewhat resentful groan from Mia, who was sitting beside me, but... was it just my imagination?

<b>

“Still, it’s surprising. I didn’t think Suzy would cry this much. I thought she’d be more composed.”

“...Yeah, I can’t imagine it from the usual Suzy.”

<b>

Annoying boys!

What did Arvin and Lombard think of me? They were making some arbitrary evaluations.

I am extremely delicate! They just don’t understand that!!

<b>

“Really? I knew this would happen! It was obvious from the start! I expected you to cry!”

<b>

Ugh! As expected of Vivi! I’ll say that here!

<b>

“...Yeah, that’s right. ...I knew it. That’s why I prepared so many handkerchiefs... but...!”

“Don’t worry. Just leave everything to me. You don’t need to trouble yourself, Mia.”

“Grrr...”

<b>

I definitely heard Mia groaning again, right?

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

Now, we are heading to Dekkenbel, located about 1200 kilometers north of the royal capital Meridies, the largest northern city with a population exceeding 200,000.

From Coop Town, the gateway to Amukam County, it’s roughly 300 kilometers in a straight line.

However, due to the mountains and valleys along the way, the actual distance is said to exceed 350 kilometers.

<b>

Last year, when the knight order came to Amukam, they traveled that distance in seven days.

Since it was a large group of over 100 people, it would normally take ten days to cover that distance, so it must have been quite a forced march.

<b>

However, the stagecoach we are using now is much more agile.

Apparently, this carriage is a “special express.”

Is that what “express” means? It feels a bit different from what I know...

Well, anyway, it seems to be much faster than a regular stagecoach.

That said, since we will stop at towns along the way, the distance we can cover in a day is said to be about 100 kilometers.

We will take three and a half days to reach Dekkenbel by this carriage.

<b>

<b>

The road is paved with stones, so the ride in the carriage is not bad.

However, as we move away from the town and enter the wilderness, there are still many unpaved roads.

Even so, the performance of this carriage is good, so there’s no need to worry too much about the ride.

<b>

The carriage we are riding is a large one that can hold 12 people.

It is pulled by four horses, and there are two people sitting in the driver's seat, a driver and an assistant.

The exterior is black with some decorations, but it is built sturdy to endure long-distance travel.

Our luggage is tied to the roof of the carriage, and smaller items are placed under the seats.

The interior is made of ebony and has a calm decoration.

The seats are covered in red leather, which has some elasticity, and the vibrations are not as jarring as I expected, but sitting for a long time will definitely accumulate damage to my backside.

However, there are many soft cushions provided in the carriage for such occasions.

<b>

We will spend three and a half days on this journey, but of course, there are other passengers besides the six of us.

When we departed from Coop Town, I realized I was making a scene in the carriage just before we reached the pass just before Masom, and I hurriedly tried to compose myself, but I knew it was too late!

Having been watched by the warm gazes of the other passengers, we’ve come this far, so there’s no helping it, right?!

<b>

<b>

The pass before Masom winds up with many curves, taking time to ascend.

The distance between Coop Town and Masom is about 6 kilometers in a straight line, but it takes nearly an hour to cross this pass.

This pass, at an elevation of about 200 meters, stretches long from east to west, and these peaks serve as natural walls, as Papa Howard had taught me before.

Those living in Amukam know full well what this pass is a barrier against.

The people of Amukam have spent a long time ensuring that nothing from Iloshio crosses over this pass.

<b>

<b>

After reaching the top of the pass, we arrived at a small square.

This place serves as a resting spot for weary horses after climbing the pass.

There is a water trough for horses filled with water, and water flowing from somewhere creates a refreshing sound.

<b>

This small resting area also serves as an observation point for the pass. If you open the window of the stopped carriage, you can see the winding road that has been carved through the fresh greenery and the vast land stretching out ahead.

The large walled town a little ahead is Coop Town, from which we just came.

Stretching about 4 to 5 kilometers from east to west, the wall surrounding the town is clearly visible.

You can also see the main street running through the center of the town and a large spire on the left side.

The bell tower of the temple with a white roof is the tallest building in this town.

On the opposite side of the street is Marsh’s workshop, and further behind it should be Cecily’s “Afternoon.”

From here, I can’t see the shops, though.

But even from here, I can clearly see the various shops lined up along the main street and the many people coming and going.

<b>

If I raise my gaze a little higher, the northern land stretches out, and the scenery beyond naturally comes into view.

Against the distant haze of the white Deipara, land cleared to seal off the deep forests spreading from the horizon lies below.

That is our village, Amukam.

<b>

Thinking that just two or three hours ago, I was still in that place, I feel something welling up in my chest again.

Even from this distance, the presence of Amukam House, standing proudly at the center of the village, reminds me once more that it is indeed the pride of the village.

To the right of Amukam House, there is a green area where the school must be located.

I can’t see it because it’s in a dip, but there should be a small bridge where we always chased small fish while cooling off between the school and Amukam House.

Also, slightly overlapping with Amukam House, there should be that ancient tree on the high ground.

And between that ancient tree and Amukam House, there’s the Croki mansion, Vivi’s home, and from there heading west, the poplar-lined path, “Croki’s Avenue,” with its lush green leaves stands proudly.

And... and if I go south down that path... Yes, that must be the windbreak forest, there... Ah, I can see a green roof! Small, but faintly! A beautiful green gable! That’s... that’s there!!

<b>

“...Ah, ah... ah, ah, aah!”

<b>

That was my breaking point.

The faces of Mama Sonia and Papa Howard floated to my mind, and just that made tears well up and my vision blur again.

<b>

“Hyuu! ...Ugh, ah, ah... uaaah! ...Abun?!”

<b>

Just as my tear ducts were about to burst, flooding with tears...

<b>

I was suddenly turned around, and my face was enveloped in something soft.

It was so soft that I could almost hear a “pofun♪” sound, and it was an incredibly soothing sensation.

<b>

“Ah, phew!? Puhah... Hamun? Un, amiyunyum...”

“Su-chan... If you feel like crying... you can cry here anytime, okay? ...Nn.”

<b>

I immediately lifted my hands to confirm the identity of the soft sensation enveloping my face, raising them to the height of the object my face was buried in, and repeatedly pressed my face against that soft mass.

With a puff-puff sound, my face was enveloped in a marshmallow-like softness.

<b>

It was Mia!

...No, I knew that already...

I was now being enveloped by Mia’s overwhelmingly powerful chest!

<b>

That power had continued to grow since the first time we met, and I had been informed that it had finally reached “H.” And it’s still growing... How terrifying!

By the way, Mia’s mother and grandmother also had formidable strength. This must be some kind of bloodline or thoroughbred... How terrifying!

Moreover, neither of them seemed to have succumbed to gravity!

Apparently, there are some secret techniques or traditions of the Mathison family... How terrifying! The Mathison family!!

<b>

By the way, the uniform we are wearing now is high-waisted, reaching just below the chest. Because of this, the chest area is inevitably emphasized.

With this, even Vivi, who has a small chest, looks somewhat presentable, which is a terrifying thing... cough cough cough!

...Just now, I felt a piercing gaze at the back of my head? ...What a perceptive one!

So! With Mia wearing this uniform, she has become an even more formidable presence!

<b>

Being pressed against her, there’s no way I could remain unscathed...

It’s only natural that I would end up groping and getting buried in it!!

<b>

“...Munyum, myu... Nn, nyumiyunyum...”

“Mm♡ Nn... Hehe.”

“Ugh... Ugh!”

<b>

As Mia stroked my head while I was buried, I heard her happy voice.

From the back, I thought I heard Anna Mary’s somewhat regretful groan... but why?

<b>

Also, from the opposite seat, I thought I heard Arvin and Lombard clearing their throats in embarrassment and Vivi’s exasperated sigh, but I didn’t care about any of that!

<b>

Eventually, the carriage started moving, and a pleasant vibration transmitted through the seats.

We should arrive at Masom in less than 30 minutes, but until then, I’ll stay like this...

There’s nothing that can resist this sinking feeling! This is the kind of soft flesh that makes a person lazy!!

I became completely absorbed in that sensation, like a cat kneading a soft cushion with its front paws.

The anxiety I had just moments ago vanished as I was enveloped in the marshmallow-like comfort.

<b>

“...Myu... Mufu♪ Ah... nyunyunyum...”

<b>

This blissful time of swaying would continue for a while longer!!
