# Episode 47: The Tale of Aurorora

Once upon a time, the world was about to be covered in great darkness.

<b>

Wars raged across the world, the Demon King appeared, and many monsters rampaged throughout the land.

<b>

The earth cracked, mountains collapsed, and forests were lost.

<b>

The gods lamented such a world and sent forth their messengers, the saviors.

<b>

The messengers of the gods were called heroes, wielding great power to defeat the evil.

<b>

To gain even greater strength, the hero ventured to the abode of the gods.

<b>

There, they underwent the trials of the gods and obtained the holy sword.

<b>

The power of the holy sword was immense, defeating all who stood against it.

<b>

It emitted a rainbow of light, cutting through mountains with a single swing, annihilating the horde of demons.

<b>

That strike even cleaved the evil dragon along with the clouds in the sky.

<b>

The hero said to the Demon King: If you continue your tyranny, I will cut down your land with the holy sword.

<b>

The hero and the Demon King glared at each other on the highland, trying to force the Demon King to declare defeat.

<b>

The Demon King was cornered.

<b>

In a last-ditch effort, the Demon King sought to unleash the evil god sealed by the gods.

<b>

If the evil god were to be released, the world, along with the five goddesses that are its foundation, would perish.

<b>

After a fierce battle, the hero defeated the Demon King and confronted the emerging evil god.

<b>

With the power of the seven world gods, the hero fought, using all the strength of the holy sword to repel the evil god.

<b>

The battle lasted for seven days and seven nights.

<b>

When the seventh night dawned, the hero appeared before the people, hair flowing and feet firmly planted on the ground.

<b>

With deep, dark eyes like the night sky, the hero declared.

<b>

The evil god has been sealed.

<b>

Bathed in the light of the rising sun, the people looked up at the figure dyed in the colors of dawn and called that person.

<b>

"The Hero of Dawn."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

-------------------------------------------------------------

<b>

<b>

<b>

The content of picture books related to heroes seen in the village is mostly like this.

<b>

"The Hero of Dawn" is pretty cool, right?

If I were to be called that, I would be so embarrassed I’d roll around and die from shame.

<b>

As a story, I don’t think it’s particularly unusual.

A hero defeats the Demon King and wins peace; it’s a classic? A commonplace? Fairy tale... maybe?

<b>

To put it bluntly, it wouldn’t be strange to find this kind of story in old light novels or web novels.

I might have read a story like this somewhere... such a commonplace tale.

<b>

However, this fairy tale isn’t entirely a work of fiction, but it’s hard to judge how much of it is historical fact.

This battle against the demons likely refers to the Great Continental War that ended in the year 2203 of the Dragon Star Calendar, which I studied in Aurorora history.

It’s truly a history from over 200 years ago.

<b>

In addition to picture books, the hero research book I borrowed from Mr. Henry also matches this timeline.

<b>

The phrase "a strike that cuts mountains" was written in the research book as an exaggerated expression or some kind of metaphor... but considering what I did... it’s hard to say it’s a complete lie. Yeah, it’s a past I want to forget...

It’s possible that the hero was a former high-level player.

Well, I can’t definitively conclude that from just this.

<b>

<b>

The holy sword is also intriguing.

If the hero was a former player, there’s a possibility it’s a game item.

If I could see it directly, it would help determine whether it’s an item or not, but of course, I have no idea where it is...

<b>

Honestly, I don’t know the hero’s name or gender at this stage.

The research book doesn’t mention a name, and the only glimpse of their appearance is in the illustrations of the picture books.

In several picture books, the hero has long hair that looks feminine.

But I can’t be certain.

There are long-haired men too...

The illustrations themselves are drawn androgynously, and the hair color varies from book to book...

The only commonality is that the eyes are black, right?

<b>

The mystery only deepens, doesn’t it?! Ta-da!!

<b>

<b>

When I return the research book to the teacher next time, I’ll ask a bit more in detail.

<b>

"Tomorrow is the trial! You should just relax at home and prepare or rest your body!"

"Well, I’ve already finished preparing."

<b>

As I closed the book and took a breath, Vivi, who had been reading the national literature textbook beside me, spoke up.

<b>

"…'Hero’s Tale'? I wondered what you were reading, coming all the way to school for this!"

<b>

Vivi looked at the book's title and sighed again in exasperation.

<b>

"…Are you interested in 'heroes'?"

<b>

Vivi asked with a slightly suspicious look, furrowing her brows.

Oh, huh? Did she think I was a "hero otaku"? Is being interested in "heroes" that kind of thing?!

<b>

"Ah... well, you see, it just came up in the kingdom history textbook about events from 200 years ago... so I was wondering if there are any related examples?"

<b>

Was that a bit forced? Maybe?

Even Algernon tilted his head on Vivi's shoulder, saying "Kikyuu?"!

<b>

"Do you... admire 'heroes'... or something? Is that the kind of story...?"

<b>

Oh, oh, Vivi is looking at me with a suspicious face! Could it be that following 'heroes' at this age makes me an otaku? Is that embarrassing?

<b>

"N-no! That's not it?! I-I’m not particularly admiring heroes! Not at all!"

<b>

Being thought of as an embarrassing person is something I’d like to avoid for now!

If I pile up any more black history on myself, it’ll be self-damage...!

Mainly, to prevent my heart from being disturbed any further!!

<b>

...Ah, but if my heart is disturbed, as long as it’s a different kind of disturbance that maintains balance... would that be better?

That would be good... maybe? Ah! No, no! That’s not the kind of conversation we’re having right now!

Well... but for tonight, for now... yeah... I know... a lot... I know.

<b>

"…Is that so? Well, if you’re not interested, then... that’s fine!"

<b>

Whoa! I was almost losing focus there! That was close!

For now, did I clear the suspicion of being a "hero otaku"?

<b>

"But! If you just want to know about that era normally...!"

<b>

Vivi looked behind me and suggested I should ask together with them over there.

<b>

"If it’s before and after the Great War, Dana is struggling with it right now!"

<b>

Prompted by Vivi, I peeked at the back seat, where Dana was holding her head, and beside her, Colin was adjusting his glasses and weaving words to advise her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"So, this is an important part of medieval kingdom history, so you can’t just ignore it, right?"

"Even if you say that, I can’t remember names of people I’ve never seen!"

"What are you saying now! The exam is next month, you know? We finally got a handle on the magic power practical, but if you fail the written test, that’s a problem!"

<b>

There were the figures of a "muscle-headed girl" and the "glasses-wearing class representative" taking care of her.

<b>

"By the way, this General Balbal?"

"General Baldermonte!! You only got the first two letters right!"

"Come on, two letters are enough to call it correct..."

"Listen... anyway! You need to be able to write down General Baldermonte’s name! This will definitely come up!"

"That name is complicated! Just call him Balbal!"

"That’s not a name! That’s some kind of groan!"

<b>

It seems Dana was saying something about a visitor.

I could feel Colin’s struggles clearly.

<b>

"Okay? General Baldermonte was a general who was active in the Great Continental War, commanding the operation to retake the Altum Plateau on the 1st of the Red Moon in 2203. He was a key figure leading to the end of the war on the 4th of the Red Moon that year. This year will come up, you know? Do you remember?"

"Ugh, remembering numbers... can I get a pass?"

"I can’t give you a pass! After the peace treaty was concluded this year, cultural exchanges with other countries became active. What was the most active exchange that took place here?"

"Food culture! Diversification of food!"

"Correct. You remember things like this properly..."

"Leave it to me!!"

"Don’t puff out your chest!"

"Come on, can’t you praise me a little to encourage me?"

"Alright, alright, but only after you remember the year!"

"Ugh, numbers... numbers..."

<b>

What the heck is going on with the Demon King?!

<b>

"Well, at least I want to manage the names of the people involved..."

"Please don’t make it hard to remember!"

"Dana, you’re being too selfish! This is for your own good, you know?! I’m not going to help you anymore!"

"Ah! I’m sorry, Colin! Don’t be mad!!"

"Come on! You think you can just hug me and everything will be fine?!"

"Please! Don’t abandon me!!"

"Stop snuggling! Come on! You have to remember properly, okay?"

"Yay, thank you! That’s why I like you, Colin!"

<b>

Oh wow, what a yuri moment... so precious...

<b>

"Alright! Um... after this, there was also a lot of exchange in magical technology, leading to the personalization of magical tools, and at the same time, the democratization movement grew significantly, but who would be the central figure in that?"

"Huh? What was it? Who?"

"Baron Kanoe! Don’t you know? He’s famous, right?"

"Ah! I know, I know! Baron Kanoe! That’s the one, 'The Hero of Dawn'!"

<b>

Oh? Did the name just suddenly get revealed?

<b>

----------------

"Hey, Dana, how long are you going to keep hugging? Do you really have the will to study?"

"Hmm? Hmm... hmm?"

"What? What’s wrong?"

"Hmm? Huh? ...Hmm..."

"So what’s wrong? Hey! Dana!"

"…The arms around me... have become... distant...?"

"!!! What?!... No!!"
