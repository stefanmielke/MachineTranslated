# 47 Aurora's Fairy Tale

Once upon a time, the world was about to be covered by a great darkness.

<blank>

Around the world, warfare was constant, demon kings appeared, and many demons also ran rampant throughout the country.

<blank>

The earth is rent asunder, mountains crumble, and forests are lost.

<blank>

The gods lamented such a world and sent messengers of the gods as saviors.

<blank>

The messengers of the gods were called heroes, wielded great power, and defeated demons.

<blank>

The heroes went to the dwelling place of the gods to receive further power.

<blank>

There he was tested by God and obtained the holy sword.

<blank>

The power of the holy sword was so mighty that it struck down all who stood against it.

<blank>

It emitted a seven-colored light and with a single swing slashed through the mountains, destroying every demon tribe that swarmed around it.

<blank>

That blow cut off even the evil dragon along with the clouds in the sky.

<blank>

The hero told the Demon King that if he continued his tyranny any longer, he would slay the entire land of the demon tribe with his holy sword. If he continued his tyranny any longer, he would slay the entire land of the demon tribe with the holy sword.

<blank>

The heroes glared at the demon king and the highland land and tried to make him declare the defeat of the demon tribe.

<blank>

The demon king was cornered.

<blank>

The demon king appealed to last resort. He wanted to release the evil gods that the gods had sealed away.

<blank>

If the evil gods are released, the world will be destroyed, along with the five goddesses that are the foundation of the world.

<blank>

The heroes defeated the Demon King after a fierce battle and confronted the evil god who was about to appear.

<blank>

He also borrowed the power of the seven world gods and used all the power of the holy sword to fight off the evil gods.

<blank>

The battle lasted seven days and seven nights.

<blank>

At the dawn of the seventh night, a brave man appeared before the people, his long hair flowing and his feet stamping on the earth.

<blank>

Then, with eyes as black and deep as the night sky, he turned to the people and proclaimed.

<blank>

He said that the evil gods were sealed.

<blank>

The people who looked up at him in the dawn colors of the rising sun called him

<blank>

With "The Hero of the Dawn.

<blank>

<blank>

-------------------------------------------------------------

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The contents of the picture books related to the heroes seen in the village are generally all like this.

<blank>

The "Dawn of the Brave" or it's cool, ehn.

If I were called, I would be so embarrassed that I would roll over and die in agony.

<blank>

As a story, I don't think it is that unusual.

The heroes conquer the Demon King and win the peace, orthodox? The conventional? Is it a fairy tale ......?

<blank>

In other words, it's the kind of plot that could be found in an old-fashioned novel or web novel.

I may have read a story like this somewhere before: ...... such a conventional story.

<blank>

However, it is not that this fairy tale is a complete creation, but it is difficult to judge how much of it is historical fact.

This battle with the demons probably refers to the continental war that ended in the year 2203 of the Cinnabar history, which we studied in the history of Aurora.

It really is more than 200 years old now.

<blank>

In addition to the picture book, the chronology is consistent with the book on the study of heroism that I borrowed from Dr. Henry.

<blank>

I know that the book says that "a blow to the mountain" is an exaggeration or a metaphor, but in light of what I did ......, it's hard to say that it's a lie. Umm, it's a past I'd like to forget. ......

After all, it is conceivable that the brave man could be a former high level player.

Well, I can't make a determination based on this alone.

<blank>

<blank>

I'm also curious about the "holy sword".

If the brave man was a former player, it could be a game item.

If I could see it in person, it would help me decide if it is an item or not, but of course I don't know where it is. ......

<blank>

To be honest, we don't know for sure at this stage the name or gender of the brave man.

His name does not appear in any research books, and his appearance is barely discernible in illustrations for picture books.

The heroes in some of the picture books have long, girlish hair.

But it can't be confirmed - can it?

Some men have long hair. ......

The illustrations themselves are drawn neutrally, and the hair color varies from book to book. ......

The only thing they have in common is that they have black eyes.

<blank>

The mystery only deepens, doesn't it? Boom!

<blank>

<blank>

Next time I return a research book to the professor, I'll ask him for more details.

<blank>

Tomorrow is the trial! Why don't you just go home and get ready or rest your body?

But I've already done the preparations."

<blank>

As I closed my book and took a break, Bibi, who was looking over a Japanese literature textbook next to me, called out to me.

<blank>

"...... 'Telling the Brave'? What the heck are you reading, coming all the way to school to read this!"

<blank>

Bibi looked at the title of the book and sighed in disgust once again.

<blank>

"...... Anta, are you interested in ...... being 'brave'?"

<blank>

Bibi raised his eyebrows and asked me, a bit suspiciously.

Oh, what? Did you think I was like a "brave otaku"? Is that what it's like to be interested in "brave" people?

<blank>

"Oh, ......, well, I was just reading about something that happened 200 years ago in a textbook on the history of the Kingdom, so I was wondering if ...... there were any related cases?"

<blank>

Was it a little bit painful? I don't know.

Even Algernon, tilting his head at Bibi's shoulder, kikk?　He says!

<blank>

"You're a 'brave' guy, like ......? Or is that what ...... is for?"

<blank>

Oh, oh, Bibi is asking me with a quizzical look! Is it possible that you are an otaku at your age, chasing after stories about "heroes"? Is he a nerd?

<blank>

No, no! No! I don't have any aspirations to be a hero! No?

<blank>

I have to ask you to give me a break from being thought of as an "itty bitty person" for now!

Currently, if I build up any more black history on myself, the self-damage is ......!

Mainly so that I don't disturb myself any more!

<blank>

......Ah, but if you can keep your mind disturbed and evened out with different disturbances, ......that's better?

Is that a good ......? Ah! No, no! That's not what I'm talking about now!

I'm still ......, but I'm going to try ...... tonight, but I'm going to try ...... to ......, but I'm going to try ...... to ......, and lots of it! I'll be at .......

<blank>

You say, "...... so? Well, if you're not interested, that's ...... fine!"

<blank>

Oops! I was about to come in the wrong direction! That was close!

At any rate, has the suspicion of being a "brave wotaku" been cleared?

<blank>

Even! If you just want to know about that era in general, go to ......!"

<blank>

Bibi looked behind me and said, "Why don't you come over there and listen with me?　I said, "Why don't you come over there and listen to it with me?

<blank>

If it was before or after the war, Dana would be suffering right now!"

<blank>

Bibi urged me on.　I peeked into the back seat and saw Dana holding her head in her hands and Colin next to her, lifting his glasses and spinning words of admonishment.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'So, you see, this is an important part of medieval kingdom history, and you can't afford not to know about it, can you?'

I can't remember the name of someone I've never seen before!"

What are you talking about now? The exam is next month. I'm finally on track to pass the practical exam, but if I fail the written exam, what's the point?"

<blank>

There was a "brain-muscle physical strength girl" and a "glasses good-looking character" who took care of her.

<blank>

"In general, this General Barbar?"

General Valdemonte! You only got the first two letters right!"

"Well, you've already got the two letters right, so why not just say the right answer: ......"

'You know, ...... anyway! You should be able to write General Valdemonte's name! Because this is definitely going to come up!"

I told you, the name is too complicated! Why don't you just call it Barbaru-Baru already!"

It's not a name anymore! It's a roar of some kind!"

<blank>

It sounds like Dana is going to be a visitor of some kind.

I could feel Colin's hard work.

<blank>

May I?" General Valdemonte was an active general in the Continental War, who commanded the operation to retake the Altum Plateau in the 1st Red Moon of 2203. He was instrumental in bringing the war to an end in the 4th Red Moon of that year. You'll get this year, okay? Remember?"

'Awww, can you spare me the ...... to memorize the numbers too?'

I can't lose," he said! After the war's end agreement was signed that year, cultural exchanges with other countries became very active. What was the most active exchange here?"

'Food Culture! Food Diversification!"

You're right. I remember all these things I said. ......"

I'll take care of it!

Don't get it off your chest!"

'Mmmm, let's give him a little praise and stretch him a little.'

"Hi-hi, when I remember the year!"

"Un numeral ...... numeral ......"

<blank>

Daimaou somehow!

<blank>

I wish I could at least manage to get the person's name right.

I don't want to be hard to remember!"

Dana, you are too selfish! You're doing this for your own good, aren't you? I don't know you anymore!"

Aww! I'm sorry, Colin! Don't be mad at me!

Oh my God! You think you can just hug me like that and get away with it?

Please! Don't abandon me!

Don't slurp! I can't help it! I can't help it, so ...... remember to do it right, okay?"

He said, "Thanks! That's why I like Colin!"

<blank>

Wow, what a lily-livered ......, precious .......

<blank>

Oh my God! Let's see... ...... After this, there was a lot of exchange of magical technology as well as food culture, the personalization of magical tools, and the growing movement for democratization, and who would you say was a key figure in this movement?"

What? What was that? Who?"

Baron Canoe! Don't you know him? Isn't he famous?"

Ahh! I know, I know! Baron Kanoe! That's him, isn't it, the "Brave Dawn"!"

<blank>

Oh, yeah? Did you just get the name of the person you're talking about?



<blank>

----------------

Hey Dana, how long are you going to hold on to me? Are you really going to study?"

Hmm? Nn...... nn?"

"What? What? What's wrong?"

Hmm? Huh? ...... hmmm."

What's wrong with you? Hey! Dana!"

"...... around the ...... arms, far away ...... became ......?"

What? What? ......!
