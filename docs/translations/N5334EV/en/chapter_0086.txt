# Interlude 2: The Craving of the Dead

Episode #2, which I intended to include in the last episode but left out due to disconnection.

<blank>

Too much volume is taken.

I was going to put it in the last episode together with the previous one.


----------------

<blank>

The horse that had been used when leaving Ilocio was pushed forward with little or no rest.

It is not far from Amkam village to Copetown. No matter how hard they ran through Irosio from early in the morning, they should not be crushed so easily yet!

<blank>

In Amkam, I was told that the Houlihan representative had already left the village and headed for Copetown.

Then we must join them as soon as possible!

You will return to King's Landing and have your reputation enhanced by this achievement!

I would not stay in a place like this for even one second longer!

<blank>

However, when Connor Clark arrived in Copetown, he learned that Fourier had long since left the area.

<blank>

What a surprise! Wasn't Mr. Houllier waiting for me to achieve something?

I risked my life to acquire a treasure that could rival a national treasure, but where the hell did he go?

<blank>

Clark had just left the hotel where Fourier was staying and was brooding in the central square of Copetown when he saw it.

Perhaps it was accidental.

Clark stopped a man who was passing by there in a loud voice.

<blank>

Oi! You! It's you! You're one of Master Fourier's guards, aren't you?

Geez!"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I just turned my eyes casually and our eyes met. It was hard to get away with it.

Jules Nard clucked his tongue vigorously at the in-betweenness.

How could this guy recognize me when I was dressed in a sooty rust-colored poncho coat and wearing a wide-brimmed ten-gallon hat of the same color?

<blank>

Where is the Fourier? Where is Master Fourier? Where the hell is he?

<blank>

Clark wound up clinging to Jules Nard.

<blank>

What the hell is this guy? Are you looking for that employer?

As I recall, this guy was one of the ones who joined Irosio. ......

It's good to be back, but you're in a hurry because you don't have an employer?

<blank>

...... Hmmm, lucky in reverse?

<blank>

I'm sure you're in Masom, Mr. Fourier. I can show you around if you like."

'Hey, Masom, is that ......? And, of course! Quick, take me to Master Fourier!

I'll take care of it. I will be responsible for delivering it to Mr. Fourier.

<blank>

To be honest, Jules Nard was fed up with being stuck over here since he came to Copetown.

Probably a pursuer from Amcam.

They are keeping their distance and keeping an eye on Jules Nard.

<blank>

He used to be Fourier's personal bodyguard. Even though he had no identification, he followed Fourier from city to city.

However, as a person who has escaped from an escort, that privilege is of least use.

Any pretense of leaving town without going through the proper procedures will quickly close that surveillance distance.

It would be nice if it were someone I could do something about, but the looming presence is the kind of monster I don't think I can handle on my own.

<blank>

Just when I was wondering what to do, this guy came along.

It was my lucky day after all. My mouth loosened involuntarily.

<blank>

For now," he said, "let's get a stagecoach. Stagecoaches take a long time, so you should definitely ask for a charter service. It will take only two hours to get to Masom. If you want to meet up with us as soon as possible, you should choose a chartered flight.

<blank>

Jules Nard made a good-natured smile and spoke to Clark.

It's a bit pricey," Jules Nard continues.

<blank>

I'm not sure how long it will take to get there, since the stagecoach runs every three hours. I hope there is just the right flight now, but if it is not good, the arrival will be at night. By that time, Mr. Fourier will have left Masom. It is quite possible that Mr. Fourier will have left Masom by then.

<blank>

A look of impatience comes over Clark's face.

We must get to Fourier's as soon as possible, and to be stranded in a place like this is no joke.

<blank>

"Ki, you! Do something! You must get me to Master Fourier as quickly as possible, no matter what it takes!

I understand. Then please prepare as much money as possible. This is an urgent charter. I would recommend you to be as tight with your money as possible.

What? Are you trying to get me to pay for this?

Unfortunately, I am not in a position to be entrusted with a wallet. If you don't provide it yourself, I can't help you.

<blank>

Then Jules Nard cowered and showed his shoulders.

<blank>

"...... Damn, damn!"

"Oh, and by the way, I'd like to mention ......

What is it? What's more? !"

From here on, you will be passing through a wasteland that is also infested with wild thieves. If something goes wrong, you'd better have enough to pay them, right?"

What? You're the one who's supposed to be protecting them, aren't you? Isn't it your job to take care of that?

Of course I'll escort you, and if there are two or three of you, I'll definitely take care of them. But if there are 10 or 20 people, it's a different story. With the Knights protecting you, there would be no fools to mess with you, but a single chartered vehicle going through the wasteland would be a real boon, wouldn't it?

<blank>

The color was clearly draining from Clark's face and falling away. Watching this with narrowed eyes, Jules Nard continued his story.

<blank>

But they are not that stupid to take a life at any cost. If you keep doing that, you'll be targeted by the scary gangs around here. That's why they are asking us to negotiate so that there will be no loss for either of us.

<blank>

Hearing that his life is not in danger of being taken, Clark's face, which had been hardening, relaxes slightly.

<blank>

Don't worry, I'll take care of the negotiations. I'll take care of the negotiations, so don't worry. Well, it's insurance. Think of it as the price of your life.

Damn! Shit! Shit!"

<blank>

Jules Nard chuckles quietly as he watches Clark swear.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

The carriage was arranged unexpectedly quickly.

If all goes well, we will reach Masom in the afternoon, not too late.

<blank>

Leaving Copetown was also uneventful.

Clark's official identification card was the face of the effect.

Sure enough, the escort, Jules Nard, also gets a free pass.

It was a lie that I had been so chilled out of my liver, unable to get out of the city.

This guy really helped me out.

<blank>

Jules Nard was stretching his body as much as he could in the chartered carriage, as if to release the tension that had existed until then.

<blank>

Clark, by contrast, paid no attention to Jules Nard, carrying his own luggage for posterity and mumbling something to himself with bloodshot eyes.

The object Clark holds is just under two meters long.

It looked like some kind of spear or staff, wrapped in a mess of dirty cloth.

The dirty cloth covering the outside of the room was wrapped so crudely that a few things inside were peeking through the cracks.

Unlike the filthy outer object, the inner object seems to be covered with a clean fabric.

And yet, the overflowing atmosphere is truly disastrous.

Jules Nard does not like that gap.

<blank>

<blank>

(Why is this guy carrying around such a scary thing like it's so important?

You have such a thing, and your future is cleanly shredded. ...... It's a blessing that you can't see it at all.

(Yeah, but is your mind already being fucked with a lot of chiis?)

<blank>

<blank>

Jules Nard was a man who lived his life by making godlike choices to avoid the path he should not have taken, .......

But sometimes he sees that the path ahead, even if it belongs to someone else other than himself, is a path with no end in sight.

He used to sift through the people he hung out with in that way.

<blank>

<blank>

(This guy has no future in sight.

Well, the long object he is carrying is very suspicious, but if you don't go near it anyway, there will be no problem.

It's a cursed treasure of sorts. It's like a cursed treasure, even though it's "God forbid I should touch it. Scary, scary, scary.

But still, this guy's eyes are going a bit wide.

(This is unexpected ......)

<blank>

...... you kill people, don't you?"

What? What is it all of a sudden? What is your evidence for such delusions!

I don't know, your face, your behavior, ...... you look like a murderer ...... who is not used to killing people. Or was it an accident or something?"

I'm not the one who did it! That was not my fault! Oh, that time! Because that thing attacked me ......, ah, because he was right in front of me!

<blank>

(haha, did you push him away and take his place? But ......)

<blank>

But he's not alone, is he?

"Nah. ......? Oh, that's him! That's ...... him! I killed him because he said I killed him! He said that if I returned to King's Landing, he would hold me accountable,......! He said he would hold me responsible if I returned to King's Landing! I will not allow such a thing! I am ...... the one!

<blank>

（I see. So you got rid of him too?

But how dare you blabber on and on about things you haven't heard ......, you must have had a lot on your mind.)

<blank>

Well, it doesn't change the fact that I've got you either way. Congratulations, you're on our side now."

I am ......, I am ............."

<blank>

Jules Nard, who seemed to have lost all interest in the matter, put his hat on deeply and stretched his legs out on the carriage seat and began to sleep.

It was as if he couldn't hear Clark's mumbling.

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

Masom is the ostensible gateway to the former Amkam territory, now Amkam County.

Merchants and travelers say that, as a gateway to the city, customs has its own set of regulations and procedures that are quite cumbersome to follow in order to get through the city.

But that's for those who live in the front, regular society.

For those who live on the other side of society, this checkpoint was full of holes. There are many ways out.

<blank>

In comparison, the security in Copetown is tight!

Furthermore, the strength of the magical barriers surrounding the city is extraordinary.

<blank>

No normal person can ever get out of something like that!

What in the world were you on the lookout for? ...... Oh, you're dealing with a hexenbiest. ...... Well, if the hexenbiests come out of Irosio, that's the last place they'll be.

If the country is overrun with Iroshio's magical beasts, it will be the end of the country.

<blank>

Jules Nard was in a good mood as he compared the security surrounding the city, and he took Clark down the main street, which is only a few hundred meters long, without getting lost.

I'm sure where he is, because I've got it from my informant.

After getting off the carriage and walking for about five minutes, I found a brick structure.

The three-story red brick building is not what one would call luxurious.

But it is the oldest and most exclusive hotel in town, so the story goes.

<blank>

This way, sir, on the top floor of the hotel, in a very special room, is Mr. Fourier."

<blank>

Jules Nard, with a big smile on his face, bent at the waist and extended his hands in a grand gesture of condescension and pointed Clark to the hotel.

<blank>

"...... this is the place? Are you sure this is the right place?

It is the best hotel in town. I can't imagine Mr. Fourier staying anywhere else.

I see... ...... sure!"

<blank>

Clark looks up at the hotel and looks satisfied, and Jules Nard, still smiling, nods broadly and takes a step closer to Clark.

Then he slowly reached into Clark's pocket and pulled out the desired object.

Feeling the weight of his suddenly lost bosom, Clarke's eyes widened in astonishment as he angrily crowded Jules Nahl.

<blank>

You, you! That's my wallet! What the hell are you doing? Give it back!

<blank>

Jules Nahl grinned and lifted the corner of his mouth as he smoothly avoided Clark's hand that was about to grab him.

<blank>

What do you mean? This is a fair reward. I brought you here, didn't I?"

What? You are hired by Mr. Fourier, aren't you! You should be paid by Mr. Fourier! The amount of money is outrageous!

"! It's a replacement, a replacement! And ...... severance!"

I'm not going to let you do that! Charge that thing ...... to Mr. Fourier!"

Shut the fuck up. You go to your boss with Totto!

<blank>

Jules Nahl, who had been yuri yuri yuri dodging Clark's grasp, came up behind Clark and kicked him in the back.

Clark jumped in just as a hotel staff member opened the door, thinking the person making noise in front of the entrance was suspicious.

Clarke rolled around grandly, the sound of his bumping around echoing through the halls.

Of course, it was not an accidental dive, but the result of Jules Nard kicking in just as the door was about to open.

<blank>

I can hear the abuse emitted by Clark from inside, but it no longer concerns Jules Nard.

He left the scene among the onlookers who had gathered to hear the commotion.

<blank>

As he moves, he takes out a jarringly heavy leather bag, unties the leather strap, opens the bag, and opens the contents, the fruits of his labor, into his palm to check them.

<blank>

"Hitofutomi ...... and five medium gold coins and twelve small gold coins. The rest is a jumble of kupr silver coins of various sizes and ......2,000 kupr or so?"

<blank>

Hah~~~.......

Don't be a wading fish, senior civil servants! What the hell, it's not even 40A in total! You said it was the price of your life!

<blank>

But, well, ......, is this how it's supposed to be?"

<blank>

Jules Nard muttered to himself as he put on his ten-gallon hat and left the place.

I will never have anything to do with these people again.

This will get rid of the bad guys. ...... He turned to the north, where Amcam is located, and shrugged his shoulders.

Jules Nard disappeared into the crowd as if melting away.

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Cameron Fourier was terribly frustrated.

<blank>

He wanted to leave Amkham as soon as possible and head for the royal capital, but he had been stranded in this city for more than a day now.

Do these officials understand who they are talking to when they say they need confirmation, procedures, etc.?

His unflappable attitude when I showed him my ID was truly infuriating!

What are you going to do if the forest is overflowing with monsters and they are closing in on me even as I am doing this?

<blank>

Fourier, who was indoors kicking furniture around irritably with his two guards, heard a commotion outside.

<blank>

"It's noisy. What is it? What's going on?

<blank>

Fourier swore as he headed out of the room, despite the fact that the sound he was making inside was clearly louder than the one outside.

Then, suddenly, the door of the room is slammed violently.

At the sound, Fourier is startled and instantly loses his color and backs away, indicating that his escort is on the lookout.

<blank>

Dear Fourier! It's me! It's Clark! It's Connor Clarke!

<blank>

From outside the door came a voice that sounded familiar to Fourier, along with what appeared to be a hotel employee trying to restrain someone.

<blank>

'Clark'? You made it back? How did you find me?

<blank>

Fourier's eyes widen as he realizes the identity of the voice's owner, and a murmur escapes him in surprise.

The sound of more banging and arguing brought Fourier to his senses, and he had his two guards open the door and invite Clark inside.

<blank>

Mr. Clark! I'm so glad you're back! I'm glad to be back."

"Mr. Fourier! What is the meaning of this? Why did you leave me?

<blank>

Clark grabbed onto Fourier's chest faster than he could enter the room, came up to bite him in the face, and launched into a grandiose rant of resentment.

Even when the two guards pulled Clark away, his momentum was unstoppable.

<blank>

Fourier, choked by the tightening of his throat, barely manages to catch his breath.

<blank>

Oh, dear! You Clark! You're going to kill me, the man I owe you! What do you think you're saying? You fucking idiot!

I'll tell you what I'm going to say! Why did you leave AMCAM and stay here?

It is none of your business what I do! Why are you here? You didn't run away from Irosio without any success, did you?

What a thing to say! I risked my life to find a national treasure and now ......!

"What? A national treasure?"

I don't need you! I don't depend on you! I will take this to King's Landing myself!

Wait! Mr. Clark! What do you mean by 'national treasure'? I didn't ask you."

I risked my life to get it! It's none of your business! This is mine!

I say, "Wait, Mr. Clark! That's more than you can handle! Let me see it first."

'Hmph! I will not be deceived! That's how you're going to rob me! That's not how it's going to go! In the first place! You have abandoned your duty! You will pay for that!

You know," he said! What are you talking about, Clark? Are you crazy?

I am serious! You are the one who is not serious! The folly of what you have done during your journey! Did you think I was unaware of it? You will be taken to the proper place and disposed of! Be prepared!

You! You! Clark!

<blank>

Fourier's complexion changes at Clark's unstoppable momentum.

<blank>

I'm not sure I'd have done it if I hadn't! I was more or less giving him a good look at ....... After all, scum are scum no matter where they go!"

Hey! What?

Enough of this useless junk! Put them away!

<blank>

At Fourier's words, two of his escorts stepped forward and between Fourier and Clark.

<blank>

What the hell? What are you doing? What are you trying to do? Get away from me!

'Mr. Clark, I'm sorry to hear that. I had hoped for just a little ...... bit more from you, you know? I never thought it would come to this. ......"

<blank>

Fourier cowered his shoulders exaggeratedly and shook his head in an acting manner.

The two guards pull out longswords from inside their black cloaks and slowly close the distance between them, holding them out so that Clark can see their blades.

Clark quickly stepped back to escape, but one of the guards circled around to block his path.

<blank>

It was neither a stand-up fight nor a getaway drama, but rather a daring end.

I noticed a white sword blade sticking out of Clark's chest.

Red blood was running down the blood groove on the blade.

Clark was just staring at it as if he were looking at something strange.

<blank>

"Hey, why ...... am I ............?"

<blank>

Before Clark could finish his words, which seemed to be barely uttered, another of the guards behind him thrust a longsword behind him.

With a coughing moan from the back of his throat, Clark fell to the floor and remained motionless.

<blank>

'Humph! You fool! If you had listened to me, you could have seen some good! Scum are still scum!

<blank>

Houllier approached the prone Clark, kicked him in the head, and venomed abominably.

<blank>

"This? This is a national treasure? If only you had shown it to us honestly from the beginning. ...... No? It is stained with dirty blood, isn't it? It's filthy! It's filthy!

<blank>

Fourier forced open his fingers and yanked the long object, which Clark was holding with all his strength to the last, out of his hands and roughly stripped the cloth that had been wrapped around it.

A clean piece of fabric peeks out from under the dirty outer wrapping. Fourier's eyes narrowed slightly as he recognized it as an item of high quality.

But the fabric is stained red with the blood that Clark shed.

Fourier, who confirmed this, cursed at Clark, who did not move again.

<blank>

Immediately after removing the clean cloth from the inside, an object reminiscent of a finely carved white silver artifact peeked out from under the cloth.

Fourier's eyes narrowed at the meticulous surface treatment that appeared.

Even the untrained eye can see that it is finely crafted, but .......

As the tightly wrapped cloth is peeled away, the whole picture comes into view.

<blank>

It's like a tangled snake itself.

Sure, it's as good as the real thing, but is it worth the price of a national treasure? Clark, you may have overstated the value of the work just for the sake of recognition.

<blank>

It happened as Houlihan was thinking about this, peeling off the remaining fabric and sifting through the items.

I felt a thump and a pulsation in my grip.

<blank>

"AHHHHHH?!!!!"

<blank>

Houlihan quickly tossed the sole.

It was as if he was holding a real snake.

<blank>

What? What is it? What was that?

<blank>

Fourier, who had thrown it out, paled, slumped down on the spot, and tried to retreat, but somehow he lost his balance and fell down.

<blank>

What? What?"

<blank>

He tries to raise his body, which has fallen to the left side, but for some reason it doesn't work.

Sensation in left arm is strange.

I fell down and barely raised my left arm. ......

From the left elbow to the tip of the elbow is cleanly gone, and blood is spurting from the shredded veins in time with the pulsation of the heart.

<blank>

'Uhhhhh? Hihhhhhhhh!!!"

<blank>

Fourier's high-pitched scream echoes through the room.

The two guards took up a stance with longswords in their hands at that moment, but a moment later, they disappeared from the neck up and collapsed on the spot, spewing blood.

<blank>

'Oooh hiiiii? Hiiiiiiiiii!!!!"

<blank>

Fourier, who had caught it in his vision, further

Raising his voice high, he tries to get away from the spot, but without his left arm, he cannot move properly and rolls over there to hit the ground.

<blank>

I heard a wet sound as if something was opening its mouth.

Fourier, who felt an impossible fear at the sound, gasped for breath, rolled on the floor, and looked fearfully in the direction.

<blank>

There, a hungry spirit, with a neck like a snake and countless fangs as sharp and thin as needles, was approaching with its mouth wide open, facing Fourier.

<blank>

Hiiii! Hiiiiiiiiii!"

<blank>

Raising his voice even higher than before, Fourier scrambles to get out of the way.

But the mouth was not one of them.

Several mouths attacked the two guards who fell first, devouring their bodies.

Its mouth extended from the long object that Fourier had thrown out.

It looks like a mythical creature that has crawled out from the depths of the earth.

I noticed that Clark's body, which had fallen earlier, had also been devoured and was hardly in its original state.

<blank>

With a thud, I suddenly felt a shock in my abdomen.

Fourier, who had almost skipped consciousness in fear, looked reflexively at the spot where he felt the impact, his eyes moistened by shallow breathing.

The abdomen, where the flesh had been rising, had been gouged out cleanly, as if a lump of clay had been scraped off with a fingertip.

<blank>

I'm so excited! Igya! Higyaaaaaaaa!!!"

<blank>

As blood gushed from the wound like a horizontal gash, a searing pain surged through me.

Houlihan was in pain, whimpering and flailing his arms and legs in an attempt to escape, but the mouths heard his cries and attacked him at once, their vicious fangs flashing.

The mouths gradually remove the flesh so that Fourier does not die immediately.

As you simultaneously taste the fear that overflows from it, little by little, .......

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

A shadow moves in the room where the pulse of life has ceased.

Someone stepped out of the shadows into the place where the smell of flesh and blood filled the air.

She had translucent white porcelain skin, a garnet dress that was redder than blood that enveloped it, and shining platinum blonde hair that flowed beautifully from side to side from the top of her head and down to her ample bosom.

<blank>

The woman quietly reached out and touched it with her fingertips, and it suddenly turned inorganic and fell to the floor, still wriggling as if searching for prey.

<blank>

"To the dead, I feed on their bitterness; to the living, I feed on their flesh and their souls."

<blank>

Picking up the cane, which had become nothing more than a walking stick, a sweet, quiet, bell-rolling voice muttered, "I'm going to go to the beach and see if I can find a place for you.

<blank>

The ancient and fearless magical relic "The Craving of the Dead," which endlessly stores the power it has taken as magical energy.

<blank>

The white fingertips of the fearless cane in his hand gently crawl over the shape of the cane as if to check its form.

<blank>

"Regardless of the nobility of your soul, power is power ....... Be of service at best."

<blank>

The woman gives a quiet smile, quietly places the cane she was holding on the table, and steps back without a sound.

<blank>

Continue on your regular path and return to your rightful Lord. ......

<blank>

The woman, Clarimonde, quietly says a few words to the cane and then disappears into the shadows as if melting.

There was nothing to move afterwards, and a ledger of silence filled the room where the tragedy had occurred.
