# Interlude 2: The Thirst of the Dead

I intended to include this in the final chapter, but it was omitted during my decluttering process, episode 2.

<b>

It's too much volume.

I was trying to combine it with the previous chapter for the final chapter, so what am I...

----------------

<b>

I urged the horse I had been using when leaving Iroshio to push forward without giving it much rest.

It's not far from Amukam village to Coop Town. Even though I had galloped through the harsh Iroshio since early morning, it shouldn't give out so easily!

<b>

In Amukam, I heard that Representative Fourier had already left the village and was heading to Coop Town.

Then I must join up as quickly as possible!

I will return to the royal capital and use this achievement to raise my own evaluation!

I can't stay in a place like this for even a second longer!

<b>

However, when Connor Clark arrived in Coop Town, he learned that Fourier had long since left the area.

<b>

What is the meaning of this?! Wasn't Representative Fourier waiting for me to achieve results?

Even though I have risked my life to obtain a treasure that rivals a national treasure, where on earth has that person gone?!

<b>

As Clark left the hotel where Fourier had been staying and stood in the central square of Coop Town, he was lost in thought when something caught his eye.

It was probably just a coincidence.

Clark called out loudly to a man passing by.

<b>

"Hey! You! It's you!! You're one of Fourier's guards, aren't you?!"

"Ugh!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

I had just glanced over casually, and our eyes met. There was no escaping this.

Jules Narl clicked his tongue in frustration at the bad timing.

Dressed in a soot-stained rusty-colored poncho coat and wearing a wide-brimmed ten-gallon hat of the same color pulled low, how could this guy notice me?!

<b>

"Where is Fourier?! Where is Fourier?!! Where could he possibly be?!!"

<b>

Clark pressed on, clinging to Jules Narl.

<b>

What’s with this guy? Is he looking for that employer?

Surely, he was one of those who entered Iroshio...

He returned, but now he's panicking because his employer is missing?

<b>

...Hmph, is this a stroke of luck for me?

<b>

"Fourier is currently in the city of Masom. Would you like me to guide you there?"

"Masom...? Of course! Hurry and take me to Fourier!!"

"Leave it to me. I will ensure you reach Fourier safely."

<b>

To be honest, since coming to Coop Town, Jules Narl had been feeling stuck and annoyed.

It was probably the pursuers from Amukam.

They were keeping a close watch on him, maintaining a distance that was neither too close nor too far.

<b>

Originally, he had been Fourier's personal guard. He had traveled between cities without needing identification while following Fourier.

However, as someone who had escaped from the guard, he could no longer use that privilege.

If he showed any signs of leaving town without proper procedures, the distance of their surveillance would close in rapidly.

It would be fine if he could manage that, but the approaching presence felt like a monster he couldn't handle alone.

<b>

Just when he was wondering what to do, this guy showed up.

This really is luck. I couldn't help but smile.

<b>

"First, let's arrange for a carriage. Using a stagecoach will take too long, so it's best to request a charter service. That way, we can reach Masom in about two hours. If you want to join up as soon as possible, a charter is the only option."

<b>

Jules Narl put on a friendly smile and spoke to Clark.

It's a bit pricey, but he continued.

<b>

"The stagecoach runs every three hours. If we’re lucky, there might be a good connection now, but if things go poorly, we might not arrive until night. By then, Fourier could have already left Masom. That’s a very real possibility."

<b>

An anxious look appeared on Clark's face.

He had to reach Fourier as soon as possible, and being held up here was no joke.

<b>

"You! Do something! Get me to Fourier as quickly as possible, no matter what!!"

"I understand. Then please prepare as much funding as you can. This is a sudden charter, after all. I recommend not worrying about the cost."

"What?! Are you trying to make me pay?!!"

"Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to hold onto a wallet. If you don't prepare it yourself, there's nothing I can do."

<b>

Saying this, Jules Narl shrugged.

<b>

"…Damn!!"

"Oh, and just to mention..."

"What?! Is there something else?!"

"From here on, we will be passing through a wild area where bandits may appear. It would be wise to prepare an amount you can pay them, just in case."

"What?! Aren't you supposed to be my guard?! Isn't it your job to handle that?!!"

"Of course, I will guard you. I can handle two or three without a doubt. However, if it’s ten or twenty, that’s a different story. If you’re protected by the knight order, those fools won’t dare to approach, but a charter service passing through the wild is a prime target."

<b>

Clark's face visibly drained of color. Watching him with narrowed eyes, Jules Narl continued speaking.

<b>

"However, those bandits aren't so foolish as to kill for no reason. If they did that repeatedly, they would attract the attention of the scary civil defense groups around here. So, they will negotiate to avoid mutual loss."

<b>

Hearing that there was no danger of losing his life, Clark's expression relaxed slightly.

<b>

"I'll handle the negotiations, so don’t worry. It’s best if we don’t run into them at all, but consider it insurance. Think of it as the price of your life."

"Damn! Damn!!"

<b>

As Clark cursed, Jules Narl quietly smirked.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

The carriage was arranged surprisingly quickly.

If things continued this smoothly, they would likely arrive in Masom by the afternoon, not too late.

<b>

When leaving Coop Town, everything went without a hitch.

Clark's official document was remarkably effective.

As expected, the guard Jules Narl also had a free pass.

It felt like a lie that he had been so anxious about leaving the city.

Thanks to this guy, he was truly relieved.

<b>

Jules Narl relaxed his tense body in the private carriage, stretching out comfortably.

<b>

In contrast, Clark, ignoring Jules Narl, clutched his belongings tightly, his eyes bloodshot as he muttered to himself.

What Clark was holding was a long object just under two meters.

Wrapped in filthy cloth in a haphazard manner, it resembled a spear or a staff.

The dirty cloth covering it was so carelessly wrapped that the object inside peeked out through the gaps.

Unlike the filthy exterior, the object inside seemed to be covered in clean fabric.

Yet, it exuded an ominous presence.

Jules Narl was not fond of that disparity.

<b>

<b>

(Why is this guy holding something so terrifying so carefully?

Carrying something like that, his future is clearly cut off... Truly, being blind to it is a real blessing.

Ah, but is his mind already a bit messed up?)

<b>

<b>

Jules Narl was a person who had lived by dodging paths he shouldn't take through almost divine choices.

However, sometimes he recognized that others, too, had paths that led nowhere.

He was good at filtering the people he associated with.

<b>

<b>

(This guy has no future at all.

Well, that long object he’s holding is definitely suspicious, but as long as I don’t get close, it should be fine.

That looks like a cursed treasure. "Don't touch the god" or whatever... Scary, oh so scary.

By the way, this guy’s eyes are a bit off.

This is unexpectedly...)

<b>

"…You’ve killed someone, haven’t you?"

"What?! What are you suddenly saying?! What evidence do you have for such nonsense?!"

"No, it’s just that your face, your behavior... it looks like someone who has killed for the first time. Or was it an accident or something?"

"Y-yes! I had no fault in that!! At that time! Something attacked me... that person was right in front of me!!"

<b>

(Oh, so you pushed them away and used them as a substitute? But...)

<b>

"However, it wasn’t just that one person, was it?"

"Wha...?! That was! ...That was because they said I killed them!! They said they would pursue responsibility once we returned to the royal capital...! At me!! Such a thing cannot be allowed!!! I... I!!"

<b>

(I see, so you took care of that one too?

But still, you’re spilling all this without being asked... you must have been holding it in for quite a while.)

<b>

"Well, either way, it doesn’t change the fact that you’ve taken a life, does it? Congratulations, you’re now officially on this side."

"I... I..."

<b>

Jules Narl, as if losing interest, pulled his hat down deeply and stretched out his legs on the carriage seat, beginning to doze off.

Clark continued to mutter to himself, but it seemed as if Jules Narl couldn't hear him at all.

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

Masom is the official gateway to the former Amukam territory, now Amukam County.

As a customs checkpoint at the gateway, there are various regulations and procedures to pass through the town, which merchants and travelers find quite bothersome.

However, that is a story for those living in the official society.

For those who dwell in the underbelly of society, the checkpoints here are full of holes. There are countless ways to slip through.

<b>

In comparison, the security of Coop Town is extremely strict!

Moreover, the strength of the magical barrier surrounding the town is extraordinary.

<b>

No ordinary person could possibly get through that!

What were they on guard against... oh, against magical beasts... Well, if magical beasts were to escape from Iroshio, that would be the last bastion.

If magical beasts from Iroshio overflowed, this country would be doomed.

<b>

While comparing the security systems surrounding the towns, Jules Narl cheerfully led Clark, moving confidently down the main street just a few hundred meters in this town.

He had the location from an informant, so there was no mistake.

After about five minutes of walking from the carriage, they arrived at a brick building.

This three-story structure made of red bricks was not what one would call luxurious.

However, it was said to be the oldest and most prestigious hotel in the town.

<b>

"This way, the top suite of this hotel is where Fourier is staying."

<b>

With a broad smile, Jules Narl exaggeratedly bent at the waist and gestured politely to Clark, indicating the hotel.

<b>

"…Is this really it? There's no mistake, right?!!"

"This is the best hotel in town. I can't imagine Fourier staying anywhere else."

"I see... Indeed!"

<b>

As Clark looked up at the hotel, appearing convinced, Jules Narl nodded enthusiastically, stepping closer to Clark.

Then, he slowly reached into Clark's pocket and pulled out the desired item.

Realizing the sudden lightness in his chest, Clark's eyes widened in shock, and he approached Jules Narl with an angry expression.

<b>

"You! That’s my wallet!! What do you think you’re doing?! Give it back!!!"

<b>

Easily dodging Clark's grasp, Jules Narl smirked.

<b>

"What am I doing? This is a legitimate reward. I brought you all the way here, didn’t I?"

"What?! You’re supposed to be employed by Fourier!! It’s only right to receive a reward from Fourier! Besides, just for guiding me, that amount is outrageous!!"

"Hah! It’s an advance! And... a severance pay!"

"Y-you must be kidding!! Such a thing... demand it from Fourier!!"

"Enough already, shut up and hurry to your boss!!"

<b>

Jules Narl, dodging Clark's attempts to grab him, circled behind Clark and kicked him in the back.

The hotel staff, suspicious of someone causing a commotion at the entrance, opened the door just as Clark stumbled in.

Clark tumbled dramatically, causing a loud crash as he collided with the surroundings inside the hall.

Of course, it wasn’t a coincidence; it was a result of Jules Narl kicking him at the moment the door opened.

<b>

Inside, Clark's curses could be heard, but it was no longer of concern to Jules Narl.

He blended into the crowd of onlookers who had gathered to see the commotion and slipped away from the scene.

<b>

As he moved, he pulled out a heavy leather pouch, untied the leather string, opened the bag, and checked the contents he had obtained.

<b>

"Just a glance... five medium gold coins and twelve small gold coins. Then there are mixed silver coins, probably around 2,000 Kupuru?"

<b>

Haaahhh...

What a mess, upper-level public servant! Even if you add it all up, it doesn’t even come to 40a! Didn’t I say that was the price of your life?!

<b>

"Well, I suppose... this is about it?"

<b>

Muttering to himself, Jules Narl pulled his ten-gallon hat down low and left the scene.

He would never get involved with these people again.

With this, he could cut ties with the dangerous crowd... He shrugged, facing north where Amukam lay.

Then, Jules Narl melted into the crowd, disappearing.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Cameron Fourier was feeling a terrible irritation.

<b>

He wanted to leave Amukam and head to the royal capital as soon as possible, yet he had been stuck in this town for over a day.

Do these officials understand who they are speaking to when they say they need confirmation and procedures?

Their attitude, unshaken even when I show my identification, is infuriating!

While I sit here, monsters could overflow from the forest and come for me! What do they plan to do then?!!

<b>

With two guards accompanying him, Fourier was kicking furniture in frustration when he heard the commotion outside.

<b>

"What's all this noise?! What’s going on?!"

<b>

Despite the fact that the noise he was making inside was clearly louder than what was happening outside, Fourier cursed at the door.

Then, suddenly, there was a loud banging on the door.

Startled by the sound, Fourier lost his color and took a step back, while his guards showed signs of alertness.

<b>

"Fourier-sama! It’s me! Clark! Connor Clark!!"

<b>

From outside the door came a voice that seemed to belong to a hotel employee trying to stop someone, along with a voice Fourier recognized.

<b>

"Clark? You made it back?! How did you find this place?!!"

<b>

Realizing the identity of the voice, Fourier's eyes widened in surprise.

As the banging on the door continued, and the argument ensued, Fourier snapped back to reality, instructing his two guards to open the door and let Clark in.

<b>

"Clark! I’m so glad you returned! I’m happy!"

"Fourier-sama!! What is the meaning of this?!! Why did you leave me behind?!!"

<b>

Before even entering the room, Clark lunged at Fourier, grabbing his chest and leaning in close, ready to unleash a torrent of complaints.

Even when the guards tried to pull Clark away, his momentum did not stop.

<b>

With his throat constricted and struggling to breathe, Fourier finally managed to gasp for air.

<b>

"Y-you! You dare to threaten me, Clark?! Are you trying to kill me, the one who has done you a favor?!! What do you mean by this?! You fool!!"

"What do you mean by this? Why did you leave Amukam and end up in a place like this?!"

"No matter what actions I take, it’s none of your concern! What about you? Are you back here without achieving any results, fleeing from Iroshio?!"

"Wha-what are you saying?! I risked my life to discover a treasure worthy of a national treasure!!"

"What? A treasure worthy of a national treasure?"

"I-I don’t need you! I’ll take this to the royal capital myself!!"

"Wait! Clark! What do you mean by a treasure worthy of a national treasure? I haven’t heard anything about it!"

"I obtained it at the risk of my life! It has nothing to do with you! This is mine!!!"

"Wait, Clark! That’s something beyond your capability! First, show it to me!"

"Hmph! I won’t be deceived! You’re trying to take it from me, aren’t you?! Not a chance!! Besides! You abandoned your responsibilities! You must face the consequences!"

"What?! What are you talking about, Clark?! Have you lost your mind?!"

"I’m serious! You’re the one who isn’t! The foolish actions you took during the journey! Did you think I wouldn’t notice?! I will report this to the appropriate authorities and have you dealt with! Be prepared!!!"

"Y-you! Clark!!"

<b>

As Clark's momentum continued, Fourier's complexion changed.

<b>

"How foolish! I had given you a chance to see some good! In the end, trash is trash, no matter how far it goes!"

"What?! What do you mean?!!"

"Enough! Useless trash is just an eyesore! Dispose of him!!"

<b>

At Fourier's command, the two guards stepped forward, positioning themselves between Fourier and Clark.

<b>

"Wha-what are you doing?! Stay away from me!!"

"Clark, I’m disappointed. I had a little... just a tiny bit of hope for you. I never expected it to come to this..."

<b>

Fourier dramatically shrugged and shook his head in a theatrical manner.

The two guards drew long swords from inside their black cloaks, brandishing them menacingly as they slowly closed in on Clark.

Clark instinctively tried to back away, but one of the guards circled around to block his escape.

<b>

It was a tragically anticlimactic ending, neither a struggle nor a chase.

Before he knew it, a white blade was thrust into Clark's chest.

Red blood flowed from the wound, tracing the blade's groove.

Clark stared at it, as if witnessing something unbelievable.

<b>

"Wha-why... am I...?"

<b>

Before Clark could finish his halting words, the other guard behind him thrust a long sword into his back.

With a choked gasp, Clark fell to the floor, motionless.

<b>

"Hmph! What a fool! If you had just listened, you might have seen some good fortune! In the end, trash is still trash!!"

<b>

Fourier approached the fallen Clark, kicked his head, and cursed him with disdain.

<b>

"Is this it? This is what you call a national treasure? If you had shown it to me honestly from the start... Huh? It’s dirty with blood! Ugh! Disgusting!!"

<b>

Fourier forcibly pried open Clark's fingers, which were still gripping the long object, and roughly tore away the cloth that had been wrapped around it.

Beneath the filthy outer cloth, a clean fabric emerged. Fourier quickly assessed it as a high-quality item, slightly softening his expression.

However, that fabric was stained red with Clark's blood.

Confirming this, Fourier hurled more insults at the now motionless Clark.

<b>

Immediately, he peeled away the inner clean cloth, revealing an intricately carved silver artifact.

Fourier squinted at the meticulously crafted surface.

Even to an amateur's eye, it was evident that it was finely made... 

As he continued to unwrap the tightly bound cloth, the overall shape began to emerge.

<b>

It resembled a snake entwined upon itself.

It certainly looked genuine, but did it truly have the value of a national treasure? Was Clark exaggerating just to gain recognition?

<b>

While Fourier pondered such thoughts and continued to unwrap the remaining cloth, it happened.

The object he was holding pulsed as if it had a heartbeat.

<b>

"Ugh?!"

<b>

Fourier instinctively threw it away.

It felt as if he were holding a real snake.

<b>

"Wha?! What was that just now?!!"

<b>

Having thrown it away, Fourier's face turned pale, and he crumpled to the ground, trying to back away but somehow losing his balance and tumbling over.

<b>

"Huh? What is this?"

<b>

As he tried to rise from the left side, for some reason, he couldn't do it well.

His left arm felt strange.

Struggling to lift his left arm, he finally saw...

His left forearm had completely vanished, blood gushing from the severed artery in time with his heartbeat.

<b>

"Ugh?! Ahhh!!!"

<b>

Fourier's high-pitched scream echoed through the room.

At that moment, the two guards, gripping their long swords, took a defensive stance, but in an instant, their heads vanished, collapsing to the ground, blood spraying.

<b>

"Ugh?! Ahhh!!!"

<b>

Fourier, witnessing this,

screamed even louder, trying to escape, but without his left arm, he couldn't move well, rolling around in panic.

<b>

He heard a wet sound, like something opening wide.

Feeling an unimaginable terror from that sound, Fourier gasped for breath, trembling as he cautiously turned his gaze toward it.

<b>

There, a ghastly spirit with a snake-like body, adorned with countless needle-like fangs, was looming toward Fourier, its mouth wide open.

<b>

"Ahh! Ahhh!!!"

<b>

Screaming louder than before, Fourier struggled to escape from it.

However, that was not the only mouth.

Many mouths attacked the two guards who had fallen earlier, devouring their bodies.

Those mouths extended from the long object Fourier had thrown away.

The creature, stretching out multiple necks, resembled a mythical monster crawling out from the depths of the earth.

Before he knew it, Clark's body, which had fallen first, was also being devoured, leaving almost no trace of its original form.

<b>

Suddenly, Fourier felt a jolt to his abdomen.

On the verge of losing consciousness from fear, Fourier glanced down at the spot where he felt the impact.

His abdomen, once bulging with flesh, had been cleanly gouged out, as if clay had been scraped away with a fingertip.

<b>

"Ughhh?! Ahhh! Nooooo!!!"

<b>

As blood gushed from the horizontal wound, a burning pain surged through him.

Fourier writhed in agony, crying out as he flailed his limbs, trying to escape, but the mouths, hearing his cries, all gleamed with ferocious fangs and lunged at him.

The mouths took their time, tearing away at Fourier's flesh, ensuring he wouldn't die immediately.

Simultaneously, they savored the fear spilling from him, bit by bit, piece by piece...

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

In the room where the pulse of life had ceased, a shadow moved.

In that place, thick with the scent of blood and flesh, someone stepped out from the shadow.

With skin as translucent as white porcelain, a dress redder than blood enveloped her, and her shining platinum blonde hair flowed beautifully from the crown of her head, cascading down to her ample bosom.

<b>

As she reached out her hand to touch the writhing creature, it instantly turned into an inanimate object, rolling to the floor.

<b>

"To the dead, I devour their resentment; to the living, I consume their flesh and soul."

<b>

Picking up the now inert object, her voice was like sweet, quiet bells.

<b>

"I will continue to accumulate the power I consume as magic without limit, the ancient and abhorrent magical relic 'The Thirst of the Dead.'"

<b>

Gently tracing the shape of the horrid staff with her white fingertips, she continued.

<b>

"Regardless of the value of souls, power is power... May you be of use."

<b>

The woman smiled softly, quietly placed the staff on the table, and silently stepped back.

<b>

"Follow the proper path and return to your rightful master..."

<b>

The woman, Clarimond, quietly spoke to the staff before melting away into the shadows.

In her wake, nothing moved, and a curtain of silence filled the room, the scene of the tragedy.

<b>

Thank you for reading!!

I'm a bit delayed due to the chaos of moving... Moving at the end of the year is a bad idea!! ＞＜

I will post another chapter after the New Year.
