# 28 Summer Vacation in Amkam, Part 2

There is a yuri flavor. Please be careful if you do not like it.


----------------

<blank>

So, it's a summer afternoon, and I'm usually kidnapped by Mia, who arrives when I've finished cleaning up for lunch.

<blank>

On sunny days, he takes me outside as a matter of course, but even on rainy days, we spend time together in my room, so there really isn't a day that goes by that I don't see him.

<blank>

My mom Sonia and dad Howard seem to be really happy that I get along with the village kids, and they always make Mia feel very welcome.

<blank>

During the first half of such a summer vacation, I was often taken around by Mia while being further abducted by Kara and her sisters.

<blank>

I wonder if they know where Mia and I are going? They usually catch us where we're going!

<blank>

<blank>

Bibi is always with me when he shows me around the village.

<blank>

She is very dependable, greeting villagers wherever she goes and explaining the facilities to them. I probably trust her the most.

<blank>

Mia, by the way, is the most healing point for me.

<blank>

Even if I have a light panic, I can calm down easily with this girl. Especially the chest, breasts, and corrupted flesh...my inner Osan goes into a joyful state!

<blank>

<blank>

The first time I was abducted by Carla and her friends, they took me straight to someone's home.

<blank>

And so begins the dress-up game.

<blank>

At first, when they took off my clothes and made me wear only my underwear, I was so embarrassed that I shrank back with tears in my eyes.

Well, even in such a situation, Mia's chest would help me get back on my feet right away!

<blank>

<blank>

I feel that my sense of shame and girlishness has grown since I came here.

If I had been a man, I wouldn't have gotten all teary-eyed and shrunken, even if I had been embarrassed.

<blank>

After they are eventually stripped of their clothes, they are changed one by one into costumes brought by the three of us.

<blank>

From the normal cute to the boyish, from the teal to the funky.

The ladies were cackling with delight and laughing hysterically. If I had a smart phone, I'm sure I'd be snapping pictures all over the place!

<blank>

Especially Alicia! I don't know if she likes this kind of thing or not, but she always comes up with things that make me want to say, "Where did you get that from? I was so impressed with her, I wanted to say, "Where did you get that from?

<blank>

Gothic Lolita-ish is still good.

Punk-like leather with lots of belts is also good because it's cool, even though it smells like the kitchen, right?

But even if it is the same leather, where did you get this outfit that is torn off here and there and almost reveals the important parts of the body, whether it is bondage or end-of-the-century champions!

<blank>

But one thing I do know.

A tiered skirt with big ribbons attached and layers of layers of big bulges.

This is the biggest outfit I've ever worn with lots of frills.

<blank>

Yes, the princess in the story or the Takarazuka! When I was made to dress like a princess in a story or a Takarazuka!

I was so excited that I knew it myself!

<blank>

I realized that I like this kind of thing!　I realized.

<blank>

I couldn't help but review my reflection in the mirror over and over again from various angles.

I enjoyed watching the skirt of light cherry fabric reflect the light as it spun around and spread out, scattering beautiful rose pink light in a flutter. ...... I posed by myself as I spun around and around in front of the mirror over and over again.

<blank>

Before I knew it, the sisters were thrashing around like they were about to die in agony.

It was a little scary to see Mia with a red face, huffing and puffing and calling my name over and over... even Bibi, who came with me that day, blushed and pulled a face.

<blank>

I came to my senses and felt extremely embarrassed, and since I was at Jessica's house that day, I crawled into her bed with a yelp!　I screamed and dove into her bed.

<blank>

Immediately after that, I was forcibly dragged out of bed, and my sisters and Mia were making a mess of me to the hilt.

<blank>

My eyeballs are rolling around in my head as I'm being sandwiched between the elasticity of various types of soft flesh, and I'm touching various parts of my body in this state... including the very hardest parts! The hand that is touching all over my body in this state! It's Mia's hand, isn't it? I just noticed it recently! Oh my God!

...... Well, I can't complain because I'm also a sucker for depraved meat...

<blank>

The first half of the summer vacation passed with these fornicating days.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the latter half of the summer vacation, Kara and her family had to prepare for their higher education, so they were not able to see each other as often as before.

<blank>

Still, we all went swimming in the early part of the month, and when the time was right, we did some standing and hunting.

<blank>

About halfway through the month, Kara suggested that we all go for a picnic to the high ground northwest of the village, as it was probably the last time we would all go together.

<blank>

There is a small lake with a spring, and the lakeside is supposed to be a flower garden this time of year, with colorful flowers in full bloom. It is Carla's wish that we all go there at the end of the trip, as it offers a panoramic view of the village.

<blank>

I would love to go there because it is my first time there, too! I took Carla's suggestion.

Mia, Dana and Colin too, as a matter of course. I can't help it! and Bibi, too.

<blank>

In the end, all eight girls decided to participate, so the temple was also excused on that day, and we all met at my house around 9:00 a.m. to depart together.

<blank>

<blank>

The distance is about 5 km from our house, and the elevation difference is about 200 meters.

We would walk there at a leisurely pace and have lunch while looking at the lakeside flower garden.

<blank>

I was excited from the very beginning.

<blank>

I was like, "Oh, by the way, is this the first time you've all been together for a picnic? Oh, my God!

'Yes, this is the first and last time Sue and I will have a picnic like this.

<blank>

Carla says something that makes me a little sad.

<blank>

Not the last! Things! Things I'll do again!"

<blank>

When I denied that I wanted him to say such a thing, he said, "I don't want you to say such a thing.

<blank>

I can't stop loving Sue! Sue's cuteness just won't stop~!"

<blank>

and Alicia comes over to hug me.

<blank>

"Fumigism."

Aaaaahhh! No hugging alone~!"

<blank>

and Jessica also had her hands around my waist from behind and hugged me.

<blank>

"Aahhhh! Jae, Jessica! I've been gagged... I've been gagged...!"

<blank>

Everyone enjoyed the hiking trip with such stable and pet-like treatment as usual.

<blank>

<blank>

Today's hat is a large straw hat.

<blank>

The ribbons, wrapped thickly around the head and spread out like large roses on the side of the head, dazzle white in the sunlight.

Today, the hair style is pigtail, which has been completely registered as a favorite.

<blank>

The sleeveless, amorpha-colored dress is very cool with the white of the ruffles.

The fabric is light and the skirt is above the knee, so one must be careful of the wind on high ground coming up from below.

<blank>

Once when a strong wind blew up, it was a close call!

I held my hat with my right hand and my skirt with the other hand to prevent it from being blown away, but the wind was whipping it up to my thighs, nearly exposing the fabric inside!

<blank>

Until recently, I didn't think anything of being skirted up and having my underwear seen, so what's the big deal now? You may think, "What's the big deal?



It seems that the shameful things are growing bigger and bigger!

It is as if they are saying, "Hurry up and grow up into something appropriate for your age! rapidly, as if to say, "Hurry up and grow up!

<blank>

So! Now I am absolutely defending my underwear!

Skirt flipping! No, no, no, no! No!

This story is not meant to affirm or promote molestation or sexual harassment!

<blank>

<blank>

On the way up, we took a short break to dip our feet in the water at a small waterfall and stream.

The water in the stream felt so good on our bodies, which were burning from the strong sun, that we all sat side by side and kicked up the water to play with it.

<blank>

When the water kicked up by the children comes on their bodies, the water splashing starts without anyone's knowledge!

Countless droplets of water dance in the air by the water's edge, echoing with cackling yellow voices.

<blank>

After playing for a while, we left the waterfront.

The high lake is just around the corner, he said.

Everyone's clothes were a little wet and see-through in various places, but they would dry quickly as long as they walked in this sunshine.

<blank>

<blank>

As we proceeded along the mountain path, which was flanked by hardwood trees and made of log stairs in long spans, we saw a break in the trees a little further ahead and a space opened up.

<blank>

You see? Over there? Is there a lake up there?

<blank>

I pointed ahead and asked Kara.

<blank>

Yes! It's just over there. If you go that way, you will see the lake soon!"

Yay! Isogo! Let's go quickly! Mia! Bibi! Come on!

<blank>

With that said, he grabs their hands and pulls them along.

<blank>

Oh! Wait, Sue! Don't be rash! I'm not going to jump! Sue-chan, you're fast! You're fast!

Wait for me! Sue! You're fast! I'm fast! You're fast! Wait for me!

<blank>

He took hold of their hands and half-heartedly dragged them up the mountain path, asking them to stop.

I'm fine, okay? I'm watching your balance so you don't fall down! Mmm-hmm...

<blank>

<blank>

I'm feeling it from around the break in the trees. The scent is wafting all the way up here!

<blank>

As I walked through the trees and out into the open space, the sight before me took my breath away.

The yellow flowers spread out all over the area swayed and waved like the surface of the water.

I jumped into the midst of it, and my whole body was enveloped in the intoxicating scent of flowers.

<blank>

The yellow flowers that fill the area are up to my waist in height.

Some of them extend close to the face!

Each flower was small and numerous, like an upside-down bunch of grapes at the end of a single stem.

When you walk into the crowd, it is as if you are in the middle of a yellow wave!

<blank>

I think it's a picture plane of the "konjiki no ino ori tatsubeshi" style!

Ah! What you're wearing is also light but blue!

<blank>

I couldn't help but run through the yellow clumps with my arms outstretched!

I was having some fun, and before I knew it, laughter was escaping from my mouth.

<blank>

After running around for a while, I went back to everyone and the sisters looked like they were about to die in agony again.

Huh? And Dana? Mia is... oh, this is normal, I've recently found out. Duh.

<blank>

So, one approached me, Colin.

<blank>

It has anti-inflammatory properties, so it can be used as a wound remedy, and if you boil it, it can be used as a cold remedy. So the dried herb tea has a nice aroma and is also good for preventing colds. I'll pick some up for you later as a souvenir.

<blank>

Smiling, he told me about this flower.

Colin is indeed an honor student who knows things! It's always nice to be able to rely on someone who can calmly and dispassionately look around and analyze situations, isn't it?

But what? Are your tangerine eyes a little droopier than usual?

Your glasses are slipping down a little. Your mouth is also a little bit clammy, like you're trying to hold something back...hmmm?

<blank>

Come to think of it, what happened to the other one, Bibi, who is always supposed to be calm? I looked for her with my eyes and found her beside Mia.

When our eyes met, he turned his head the day after tomorrow! Why? I thought her face was red, but... why did she look away, Bear? I don't get it!

<blank>

'Oh, Sue's been a steady angel today, too ......, but she's skipping too far! Aah!"

<blank>

I think I heard Alicia muttering to herself.

<blank>

<blank>

Beyond the cluster of "golden canes" stretched the surface of the water.

It is much smaller than the highland lakes seen before.

But it is bigger than Hodgson's pond and the clarity of the water is just amazing.

The water is emerald green in color, as if gems were laid out on the bottom of the lake!

<blank>

Coniferous trees growing in the sky, clustered in places in the green area around the lake.

In addition to the yellow flowers on Coco, the lakeside was filled with colorful white, red and purple flowers.

<blank>

Several kinds of waterfowl are drifting on the surface of the water.

There are fish that occasionally leap up from the surface of the water, and I wonder if that's what they're after.

A pleasant breeze blew by as I stood by the lakeside and watched the lake.

The wind chilled by the lake gently caresses her cheeks and the hem of her skirt flutters.

<blank>

As I was relaxing in the comfort of the wind, Kara came up behind me.

<blank>

"Sue, come here and take a look. This is the best place to see it."

<blank>

As Carla led me by the hand, we came to a place where the view toward the village widened.

The railing is attached with logs.

Beyond the railing, there are few trees, and a gentle slope leads downward.

There were rocks jutting out in places on the slope, but almost the entire area was covered with small flowers like blue-purple grass cherry blossoms.

<blank>

A sigh escaped me.

Carpet. A blue-purple carpet spread all the way to the village.

It looked that way.

<blank>

He takes off his hat, holds it by his chest, and gazes at the landscape below.

You can see the whole village from here....

<blank>

<blank>

The wheat fields, which I was so impressed to see on the day I first came to Amkam, are now neatly hunted and striped with a dead color, and straw rolls can be seen lying in some places.

<blank>

On the left hand side, is it to the east when viewed from here? You can see our house, though it is small.

The glimmering white stuff must be the washed sheets that I couldn't help Mr. Elrose with this morning.

I'll take it in when I get back, so wait for me.

<blank>

To its right is the temple, a white building.

<blank>

The village hall of Amkam is also well understood.

This is indeed the former residence of the Amkham frontier count! You can see its majesty even from here.

The slate roof is clearly visible shining in black.

<blank>

<blank>

Much farther to the east is probably the ocean where we all went last month, although it is not visible from here.

<blank>

The Amkam forest stretches to the north, and the Deipala Mountains are supposed to rise beyond it, but ...... I can't see anything!

Mainly for my own mental health!

<blank>

<blank>

What do you think? Isn't this a great location? I wanted to come here with you guys before I left the village."

Yeah! It's great, Kara! I'm so glad I got to come with you guys!"

Thank you Sue. Don't forget about us when you say goodbye. I don't want you to forget us.

<blank>

I can feel the strength in Kara's gripped hand.

<blank>

I won't forget! I'm not going to forget! I don't want to say goodbye.

<blank>

I grabbed Kara's hand back with both hands and screamed, as she said something that made my teary eyes go loose.

<blank>

<blank>

Then another hand now held his shoulder from behind, and in his ear.

<blank>

Thank you, I'll never forget you. My sweet baby."

<blank>

My hair stood up on end and Kara's corkscrews were diminishing at about the same time.

<blank>

The "Soretto" was sent flying backward with a sound like something being crushed.

<blank>

Where did you come from...how did you come from? Where... how did you come from?

<blank>

Kara takes a stance and asks "Sole" with a sharp look in her eyes.

They are fully prepared for battle.

<blank>

<blank>

Sole coolly brushed her beautiful platinum blonde hair as if nothing had happened.

<blank>

Oyoyoshiyoko, distance and place are irrelevant to us, as we are in love. Where are you from? What kind of meaningless question is that?

<blank>

You're talking about imitative things with your eyes down in a huff, but your nose is bleeding like a pig.

<blank>

Hearing the commotion, everyone gathered around.

<blank>

"Victor! How did you get here?

What do you mean? Why are you here?

<blank>

Victor is like answering Alicia and Jessica's question....

<blank>

You don't need a reason to go see someone you love, okay? The time you don't see them nurtures your love. Lil' girl."

<blank>

I think I've heard that line somewhere before...but it came back to me from behind Dana's back.

<blank>

I was close to Dana's back and gently held her left wrist with my left hand, and then I put my right hand around her waist from behind as if I was crawling on her back... and then I put my chin on her right shoulder and blew in her ear.

<blank>

Miiigyaaaaahhhh!"

<blank>

Oh, I could clearly see that Dana was also grossly overstuffed.

<blank>

Immediately afterward, Dana swung down a stick-shaped object that she had taken out of somewhere with great force.

It slid out like a folding baton and became a short spear! It slid and extended like a folding baton and became a short spear!

<blank>

Dana turned his short spear quickly and swung it into Victor's side, striking him in the side.

<blank>

Mekyobakki!

<blank>

The sound of something shattering or breaking is heard, and Victor's body bends into a "ku" shape and is blown away.

The large tree ahead of the bush made a sound as if something had hit it, and it shook greatly.

<blank>

Everybody brace yourselves! This thing is not over!"

<blank>

Jessica calls out to everyone and flies instructions.

<blank>

Dana! Stay alert on the north side where the thing flew away! Kara! Kara, take the south at that spot! Alicia! You take the west! Colin, you take Dana! Bibi for Alicia! I'll take Kara! Auxiliary and alert, respectively! Mia! You stay close to Sue! It's definitely aiming for Sue!

<blank>

I mean, the level of enthusiasm, the sense of tension, the teamwork, etc., is more focused than when we all went hunting in the shallow layer of the forest at the beginning of the month, isn't it?

You all have scary eyes, don't you?

<blank>

<blank>

What's going on? I don't understand why you're suddenly popping up in a place like this, ......!

<blank>

Dana mutters to herself, wary of her surroundings....

<blank>

Well, it was just a coincidence, really. I came here to make memories of my sisters after a short break, and there they are all together. Don't you think it's fate? Don't you think? My Lil' Girl."

<blank>

Victor spoke up as he held Dana by the waist.

Dana looks at Victor with a surprised look in her eyes.

Ahh! Now Victor's hand caressed Dana's ass!

<blank>

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ！！！！！！"

<blank>

Wow! A rare girlish scream came out of Dana's mouth!

<blank>

Dana gets teary-eyed and swings her short spear out at high speed, but the spear cuts through the air in vain.

Victor is already not there.

<blank>

What we need is not to fight. We need to love each other. Don't you think so? My darling.

<blank>

She grabs Alicia's arm as she runs to Dana to check on Victor, and as she pulls him into a hug, Victor mutters something like some love warriors.

<blank>

What you need is rigorous and direct physical and verbal pedagogical instruction!

<blank>

Alicia puts her elbow on Victor's neck and pulls him straight down to the right.

At the same time, the legs are paid outward and Victor's body is turned around and toppled to the right.

<blank>

But before his body reaches the ground, Victor is already gone.

<blank>

As if sensing something, Carla climbed up to the top of a nearby tall coniferous tree, twirling around the trunk and branches.

He's on a branch about 15 meters off the ground, looking around on the ground, alert.

<blank>

'If we're going to speak the same words, let's speak words of love as we put those lovely lips together. My Sweetheart."

<blank>

Victor holds Carla from behind and talks further in her sleep with his mouth on her lips!

<blank>

Kara slips out of Viktor's arms and goes behind him, hugging his arms and restraining him.

Then, as if doing a suplex, he fell headfirst to the ground!

<blank>

Aah! That, that's the Ninpo I rope drop! Kara! That technique is not something you do with a skirt!

<blank>

You and the earth are on the same lips!

<blank>

Just before Victor's head made contact with the ground, Kara broke away from Victor and spun several times in the air before landing on the ground.

<blank>

At about the same time, Victor's head hit the ground with a resounding thud.

<blank>

But! The figure is nowhere to be found, leaving a gouge in the ground!

Who is this guy? This man is a god and an immortal! Is he really human?

<blank>

If we're going to kiss, don't you think it's the duty of a boy to teach these pretty lips the sweetness of love? My baby."

<blank>

Before I knew it, Victor had his right hand on my left cheek and was whispering to me as he brought his face close to mine.

<blank>

Oh... my face... a man's face is so close, his breath is on my cheek... why? Why can't I move my body?

Aah... my breath touched my nose... my thoughts... stop. ......

<blank>

Mekyomikkibbakikkiyot!

<blank>

A funny sound was heard and a beautiful leg was reduced to Victor's face as he spun around.

His neck is also twisted and buried in the body as if it were crushed.

<blank>

Alicia's cone rubbing kick explodes into Victor's face and blows him away! A real swastika kick!

<blank>

I let out a grand exhale of breath as I was released from Victor.

Apparently, he forgot to breathe.

The palpitations in my chest...my heart was pulsating at a tremendous rate.

I can feel my heart beating behind my ears.

<blank>

I lost all my strength and almost collapsed to my knees.

<blank>

"Suu, Suu-chan, are you okay? Su-chan!

<blank>

Mia held me up.

Mia looks into my face with concern and calls my name repeatedly.

<blank>

Why didn't I notice his approach? It's not like I couldn't detect his approach if I was aware of his actions....

<blank>

Oh, by the way...I remember a junior once telling me about this: .......

<blank>

I heard that even a master who looks like a monster can receive an unexpected blow. Well, from a child, that is. He said that his two-year-old nephew was swinging a toy and it hit the head of the master who was sitting on the floor! hit the head of the master who was sitting down. I don't care if it is a person who has the consciousness to attack or act. But the blow from a pure and innocent child with no evil intentions was too much for even the master to detect.

<blank>

If that's the case, then his actions were pure and innocent, without any ill feelings or evil intentions....

<blank>

What is that? I'm afraid of the opposite!

<blank>

Is it the kind of thing that is pure instinct and reflex of desire impulse indiscriminate?

Oh no! It's really creepy-crawly!

I held myself by the shoulders and shivered with a burr.

<blank>

"Were you so scared, Sue? It's okay, okay? It's going to be okay, okay?

<blank>

Then Mia hugged me.

Aha, this warmth and the comfort of softly wrapped corrupt flesh calms me.

Let's not think about anything now, let's just embrace and bury ourselves in this blissful fat scraping.

<blank>

"Soo, Soo-chan... um, you know... did I... touch your lips? Did you...?"

<blank>

I couldn't help but twitch and look up at Mia.

<blank>

Oh! I'm sorry! I remembered, didn't I? I'm sorry!

No, it's not! No, it's not! I didn't touch you! It's okay, he didn't touch me! I'm fine!

Really? Really? I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad... Sue's first time... it was OK, wasn't it? I'm so glad.

<blank>

Mia hugged me and said so.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Behind me, I can feel the angry fighting spirit brewing.

<blank>

Sisters.

Although I could not see it directly because I was hugging Mia, I could see that the fighting spirit was blowing out at a tremendous rate.

<blank>

 You're ready... aren't you!

I'm going to crush you for real today, okay? I'm going to crush you, I'm going to crush you, I'm going to crush you!

Oh." He even stroked my ass! And on top of that, even Sue, oh, my God, she did that to me!"

<blank>

Colin, Bibi. You two go find Mary and Shelly. I'm sure that idiot has left his sisters behind. Oh, and bring them as far away from here as possible so they don't see what happens next, okay?"

<blank>

DODDDONG! DODDONG! and a terrific impact sound began to echo.

The sound of strong blows and destruction roared through the air intermittently.

<blank>

<blank>

I think about it as I stare at Mia.

<blank>

Even though she remembers being a man, she now has the body of a girl and the mind of a daughter.

If she continues to grow, she may at some point become aware of men as the opposite sex and engage in such behavior.

<blank>

But that's still hard to do now!

I am too young to accept a man as a member of the opposite sex, and for me the hurdle is too high.

<blank>

You have to be fully prepared!

I thought so, I thought so... and yet my body tensed up just by seeing a man's face so close... It's true that Victor is so beautiful that it makes me nervous just to look at his face....

Is it because my physical body reacts on its own that my heart palpitates faster just by the proximity of my mouth?

<blank>

Am I the type of person who can't refuse someone who pushes me too hard?

Will that time come sooner than I think?

You literally can't prepare your mind, okay?

<blank>

At least if your lips are as soft as this Mia's... I wish such a gentle mouth could touch my lips... such... such a beautiful .......

<blank>

...... Sue?"

<blank>

I huffed.

Did you notice my eyes? Did I look like I wanted something?

Unable to stay, I buried my face in Mia's chest and tried to hide my embarrassment.

<blank>

"...Hey, Sue. Can I see your face?"

<blank>

I shake my head, burying my face in Mia's chest.

I know what I look like now.

I can't let Mia see this face!

<blank>

Please, Sue...I want to see."

<blank>

Mia's hands spread out to encircle my cheeks, and her fingertips brush the nape of my neck.

<blank>

Hi ahn! Nnnn!

<blank>

Ah..! If you touch me like that on that spot..!

The body jumped up with a jerk and his face went up.

As it is, Mia wraps her cheeks around him and turns her face toward him.

<blank>

He's breathing hard... I can see his cheeks are stained and his eyes are moist.

I'm sure I'm looking very gauche right now.

<blank>

Sue-chan...ah, Sue-chan! I've never seen Su-chan with such a pretty face..."

Hi.

<blank>

Embarrassing!

I was so embarrassed and wanted to hide my face, but Mia looked into my face...

Her cheeks blush even more with shame and her heart beats louder in her chest.

I am sure Mia can feel my heart beating in her chest.

<blank>

I almost collapse from my knees, and I put my arms around Mia's back and cling to her.

Then Mia's face comes closer...

If I keep this up...no, I can't take my eyes off Mia's lips anymore.

My lips open thinly, as if in anticipation of something, regardless of my will.

<blank>

"Suu...cha......n."

<blank>

A soft touch on the lips for a brief moment.

<blank>

It is so warm and enveloping that I feel like I am melting.

<blank>

But it is only for a moment, and the feeling is soon lost.

<blank>

More...even though I'd like to stay that way. ......

<blank>

Ah.

<blank>

A sad voice escapes my lips as the object leaves my lips.

<blank>

My eyes are now following Mia's lips as they move away from me very greedily.

<blank>

Mia, with both palms wrapped around my face, smiled very kindly and ......

<blank>

Is this Sue's... first time...?"

<blank>

He asked me that happily.

<blank>

...hmm.

<blank>

I'm so embarrassed that I take my eyes off Mia.

<blank>

I'm not sure if you don't like me...? Did ...... you hate me...?"

<blank>

Mia took her hand away from my cheek and said sadly, "I'm sorry.

I turned my face vigorously to Mia.

<blank>

I don't want to! I don't hate it! I don't hate it! I love you... ah..."

<blank>

I was so desperate that I denied it, but if I said, 'I don't dislike it, I don't hate it,' they would take it as a sign that I wanted more.

<blank>

And I've said I like it!

Too embarrassing! I looked down, knowing my face was turning red again.

<blank>

Thank you, Sue. I love you too.

<blank>

He then cupped my cheeks in his palms once more, gently rubbed forehead to forehead, nose to nose, gently kissed the tip of my nose, and finally hugged me tightly.

<blank>

Uh-uh.

<blank>

Oh, you're not going to lip-synch me now?

I couldn't help but let out a gasp.

<blank>

Did I look greedy?

Mia had a happy smile on her face that I had never seen before.

<blank>

Those eyes, the first time I saw Mia's eyes, were terribly fascinating and I couldn't look straight at her.

I feel as if I'm being watched, and I can't help but feel uncomfortable, as if I'm being watched for my own shallow lust.

<blank>

But I would like to see more.

I want to be seen.

<blank>

Mia's hand was cupping my cheek, and I laid my hand on Mia's and rubbed my cheek against her hand.

Mia's eyes narrow even more happily.

<blank>

Oh, I love those eyes....

<blank>

I no longer care about Victor or my future with men, which had occupied my mind until a moment ago.

<blank>

In the distance, the earth still echoed continuously.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After this, the restrained Victor finally settled down as he was wrapped in a bamboo screen wrapped around a rope and hung upside down on a high tree branch with an inverted minnow.

<blank>

Mary and Shelly joined us, and we enjoyed a lunch of 10 people at the waterfront and a short time in the waterfront garden before returning to the village.

<blank>

I remembered that I had left Victor hanging after returning to the village, but oh well, it's him, so it's all good.

And I immediately delit from my head.

<blank>

My perception of him seems to have finally aligned with everyone else.

<blank>

I had a hard time sleeping that night.

My mind was whirling with thoughts, fantasies, and desires, and I kept doing various things more times than usual.

<blank>

Aha, where am I headed?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

On this day, with only three days left of summer vacation, Carla and her friends head to the high school dormitory in DeKembel.

<blank>

We went to the stagecoach stop in Copetown to see them off.

<blank>

Kara, Alicia, and Jessica took turns hugging each other and saying goodbye.

I also shook hands with Arrows. Victor may have been there, but I don't know because he was out of sight.

<blank>

As we were about to leave, I said goodbye to the three of them once more, and when Carla said good-bye, something suddenly came over me and I said, "I don't want to say good-bye," and tears started to stream down my face.

<blank>

After that, I couldn't see much because of the haze of tears, and I was clinging to Mia, so I didn't understand much.

<blank>

The three sisters started crying too. I still won't go!　I'll take Sue with me!　I won't let go of you!　They were all in an uproar.

<blank>

<blank>

The stagecoach departed on time, and we saw them off with tears in our eyes as they leaned out the window and waved back at Kara and her friends.

<blank>

<blank>

That day, in an attempt to comfort me a little after I had been so heartbroken by the adults around me, a sleepover event was planned and carried out at the home of Mia, who was my closest friend.

<blank>

Indeed, the loneliness was soothed and the sleepover was too stimulating to be terribly comforting....

I can't tell you what kind of comfort they gave me...but...I can't tell you!

<blank>

Thus passed my first summer in AMCAM with a little growth in me.

<blank>

Eventually, the months changed and the new school year began at the end of the first week of the 5 Ao month.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Then, three days after the new semester began.

He came to the village in the middle of that week.
