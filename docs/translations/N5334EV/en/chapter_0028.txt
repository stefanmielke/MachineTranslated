# Episode 28: Amukamu's Summer Vacation Part 2

There is a yuri flavor. Please be cautious if you are not fond of it.

----------------

<b>

So, on a summer afternoon, I get abducted by Mia around the time I finish cleaning up after lunch.

<b>

On sunny days, I am naturally taken outside, but even on rainy days, we spend time together in my room, so there really isn't a day we don't meet.

<b>

My Sonia Mama and Howard Papa seem really happy that I get along with the village kids, and they always welcome Mia very warmly.

<b>

During the first half of summer vacation, I was often taken around by Mia, but I was also frequently abducted by Carla and the older girls.

<b>

I wonder if those people know where Mia and I are going? We usually get caught at our destination!

<b>

<b>

Whenever they guide me around the village, Bibi is always with us.

<b>

She properly greets the villagers and explains the facilities, making her very reliable. I probably trust her the most.

<b>

By the way, Mia is my number one source of comfort.

<b>

Even if I lightly panic, I calm down immediately when she's around. Especially her chest... my inner self revels in joy!

<b>

<b>

At first, when I was abducted by Carla and the others, I was taken straight to someone's house.

<b>

And then the dress-up game begins.

<b>

At first, when I was stripped down to just my underwear, I felt so embarrassed that I shrank back with teary eyes.

Well, even at such times, if I have Mia's chest, I can recover quickly!

<b>

<b>

I feel like my sense of shame and girlish feelings have grown significantly since coming here.

If I were a boy, I wouldn't have shrunk back with teary eyes, even if I felt embarrassed.

<b>

In the end, after being stripped of my clothes, I was dressed up in outfits that the three of them brought one after another.

<b>

From cute outfits to boyish ones, silly ones, and funky ones.

The older girls were delighted and laughed a lot. If we had smartphones, they would definitely be taking tons of pictures!

<b>

Especially Alicia! I want to ask where she gets all those things she brings that are so fitting for this kind of situation.

<b>

The goth-loli style is still fine.

The punk style with lots of belts is a bit cringy but looks cool, right?!

But the same leather... where did she get that bondage outfit that looks like it's been ripped apart and is almost exposing important parts!?

<b>

But I've realized one thing.

With a big ribbon attached, the tiered skirt that is layered and puffed out.

The outfit with the biggest and most frills I've ever worn.

<b>

Yes, when I was dressed up like a princess or a Takarazuka performer.

I could feel my excitement skyrocketing!

<b>

Ah, I've realized I like this kind of thing!

<b>

I couldn't help but check myself in the mirror from various angles.

When I twirled around, the light pink skirt reflected the light, spreading beautiful rose-pink light as it fluttered, and I enjoyed spinning in front of the mirror, posing alone...

<b>

Before I knew it, the older girls were rolling around, looking like they were about to faint.

It was a bit scary when Mia was calling my name repeatedly with a red face... but that day, even Bibi, who came with us, was blushing and trembling.

<b>

Suddenly, I snapped back to reality and felt extremely embarrassed, and since that day we were at Jessica's house, I dove into her bed while shouting "Uunyahhh!!"

<b>

Right after that, I was forcibly dragged out of bed and thoroughly messed around by the older girls and Mia.

<b>

I was surrounded by various soft, bouncy bodies, and my eyes were spinning, but those hands were touching various parts of my body... including some very sensitive areas! Those were Mia's hands, right?! I just realized that recently! No way!!

...Well, I can't complain since I'm also groping soft flesh...

<b>

Those noisy days passed, and the first half of summer vacation went by.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As summer vacation entered its second half, on the 4th of the Red Moon, Carla and the others had various preparations for advancing to the next grade, so we couldn't meet as often as before.

<b>

Still, in the early part of the month, we all went to the beach, and when we had time, we also did some hunting.

<b>

Around the middle of that month, Carla suggested that since this might be our last chance, we should all go on a picnic to a high place northwest of the village.

<b>

There is a spring there, and a small lake, and at this time of year, colorful flowers should be blooming all around, turning it into a flower field. Since we can see the whole village from there, Carla wanted to go one last time together.

<b>

Since it was my first time going to that place, I eagerly agreed to Carla's suggestion!

Naturally, Mia, Dana, and Colin also joined. Bibi said, "I can't help it!"

<b>

In the end, all eight girls participated, so on the day of the picnic, we took a break from the temple and gathered at my house around 9 o'clock to set off together.

<b>

<b>

The distance is about 5 kilometers from my house, with an elevation difference of about 200 meters.

We would walk leisurely, having lunch while looking at the flower fields by the lakeside.

<b>

I felt excited right from the start, and I was already in a good mood.

<b>

"By the way, is this the first time we're all together for a picnic? ...It is!"

"That's right, this is the first and last time I'll be having a picnic with Sue like this."

<b>

Carla said something a bit sentimental.

<b>

"It's not the last! We'll do it again...!"

<b>

When I denied it, not wanting her to say such things.

<b>

"Ugh! Sue's cuteness is unstoppable!!"

<b>

Alicia hugged me.

<b>

"Fumigyu!"

"Ahhh! No hugging alone!!"

<b>

Jessica also wrapped her arms around my waist from behind and hugged me.

<b>

"Ahh! Je-Jessica! That's ticklish...!"

<b>

With such stable treatment as a beloved pet, we all enjoyed the hiking trail together.

<b>

<b>

Today's hat is a large straw hat.

<b>

It has a thick wrap around the head, and a big ribbon braided like a rose on the side shines white in the sunlight.

Today, my hairstyle is a pig tail that has been completely registered as my favorite.

<b>

The sleeveless forget-me-not colored dress is very refreshing, especially with the white frills.

The fabric is light, and the skirt is above the knee, so I need to be careful of the wind coming up from below at the high place.

<b>

When a strong wind blew up, it was dangerous!

I pressed my hat down with my right hand and held my skirt down with the other, but the wind lifted it up to my thighs, almost exposing the fabric underneath!

<b>

Not long ago, I wouldn't have thought anything of my skirt being lifted and my underwear being seen, but now... I might be thought of as someone who is suddenly shy!

Um, how should I put it... since I became aware that I am a "pubescent girl"?

My sense of modesty seems to be growing rapidly!

As if to say, "Hurry up and grow up to something appropriate for your age!"

<b>

So!! Right now, I absolutely must protect my underwear!

No lifting skirts! No way! Absolutely!!

This story does not condone or promote sexual harassment or indecent acts!!

<b>

<b>

On the way up, we took a short break by dipping our feet in a small waterfall and stream.

The cool water felt great on our sun-heated bodies, and we all sat in a line, splashing water and playing.

<b>

As the splashed water hit our bodies, a water fight began without anyone saying anything!

We squealed and laughed, and countless droplets danced in the air by the water's edge.

<b>

After playing for a while, we left the water's edge.

The lake on the high ground should be just ahead.

Although everyone's clothes were a bit wet and some parts were see-through, they would dry quickly while walking in this sunlight.

<b>

<b>

As we walked along the mountain path, which was made with logs in a long span between broadleaf trees, we saw a clearing ahead where the trees parted.

<b>

"Hey? Over there? Beyond that, is there a lake...?"

<b>

I pointed ahead and asked Carla.

<b>

"Yes! It's just beyond there. If we go there, we'll see the lake right away!"

"Yay! Let's hurry! Mia! Bibi! Hurry up!!"

<b>

Saying that, I grabbed both of their hands and pulled them along.

<b>

"Ah! Wait, Sue-chan! Be careful! Don't fall! Sue-chan is fast! So fast!!"

"Wait up! Sue! You're too fast! Slow down!!"

<b>

I held the hands of the two who were asking me to stop and half-dragged them up the mountain path.

Don't worry! I'm making sure not to trip! Heheâ™ª

<b>

<b>

I could feel it from the moment I saw the gap in the trees. The fragrance was wafting all the way here!

<b>

As we passed through the trees and entered the open space, I gasped at the sight before me.

A sea of yellow flowers swayed and danced, rippling like the surface of water.

Without thinking, I jumped right into the middle of it, and the overwhelming scent of flowers enveloped me.

<b>

The yellow flowers surrounding us were taller than my waist.

Some even reached close to my face!

Each flower was small, with many blooms resembling a bunch of grapes hanging upside down at the end of a single stem.

As I entered the cluster, it felt like I was in the middle of a yellow wave!

<b>

It was like a scene from a painting that says, "This is where the golden fragrance descends!"

Oh! And my clothes are light blue!

<b>

I couldn't help but spread my arms and run around in the sea of yellow flowers!

I felt so happy that laughter escaped my lips without me realizing it.

<b>

After running around for a while, when I returned to everyone, the older girls had looks on their faces as if they were about to faint.

Huh? Dana too? Mia... oh, this is just her usual self, I realized recently. Yup.

<b>

Then, Colin approached me.

<b>

"This flower is called 'Golden Staff.' It has anti-inflammatory properties, so it can be used as a wound remedy, and if you boil it down, it can also be used as a cold medicine. So dried herbal tea made from it smells good and helps prevent colds. Let's pick some for souvenirs later."

<b>

She smiled and told me about the flower.

As expected of the knowledgeable honor student Colin! It's so reassuring to have someone who can calmly analyze the situation!

But wait? Is her expression a bit droopy compared to usual?

Her glasses are slightly slipping down! And her mouth seems to be twitching as if she's trying to hold something back... huh?

<b>

Speaking of which, where's Bibi, who is usually so calm? When I looked around, she was next to Mia.

When our eyes met, she turned away, looking in a completely different direction! Why!? I thought I saw her face turn red... but why is she avoiding my gaze, Bear-chan!? I don't understand!!

<b>

"Ah, Sue looks like a stable angel today... but you're going overboard! Hah!"

<b>

I think I heard Alicia muttering that.

<b>

<b>

At the end of the cluster of 'Golden Staff' flowers, the surface of the water spread out.

Compared to the highland lake I saw before, it was much smaller.

But it's bigger than Hodgeson's Pond, and the clarity of the water is incredible.

The water is emerald green, as if jewels are strewn across the lakebed!

<b>

Around the lake, there are patches of greenery, with coniferous trees reaching up to the sky in places.

Besides the yellow flowers blooming here, there are also various flowers in white and red-purple colors blooming all around.

<b>

Various water birds drifted on the surface of the water.

Occasionally, fish jumped out of the water, perhaps aiming for them?

Standing by the lakeside and watching the scene, a pleasant breeze blew by.

The wind, cooled by the lake, gently caressed my cheeks, and the hem of my skirt fluttered.

<b>

As I surrendered to the pleasantness of the wind, Carla came up from behind.

<b>

"Sue, come here and look. This is the best view here."

<b>

As Carla led me, we arrived at a spot where the view opened up towards the village.

There was a railing made of logs.

Beyond the railing, there were almost no trees, and a gentle slope led downwards.

On that slope, there were rocks protruding here and there, but mostly it was covered with small blue-purple flowers like phlox.

<b>

A sigh escaped my lips.

It looked like a carpet. A blue-purple carpet spread out all the way to the village.

That's how it appeared.

<b>

I took off my hat, holding it against my chest, and gazed at the scenery below.

From here, I could see the entire village...

<b>

<b>

I could see the wheat fields that had moved me when I first came to Amukamu, now beautifully harvested, with brown stripes spreading out and straw rolls scattered here and there.

<b>

To my left, which would be east from this viewpoint, I could see my house, small but visible.

The white things I see are probably the sheets that I couldn't help Elrose with this morning.

I'll take them in when I get back, so please wait for me.

<b>

To the right, there is the white building of the temple.

<b>

I can also see the Amukamu village office clearly.

As expected of the former Amukamu border lord's castle! Even from here, I can see its grandeur.

I can clearly see the slate roof shining black.

<b>

<b>

Further east, although I can't see it from here, there should be the sea we all went to last month.

<b>

To the north, the Amukamu forest spreads out, and beyond that, the Deipara mountain range should be towering... but... I can't see anything!

Mainly due to my mental health issues!!

<b>

<b>

"How is it? It's a great location, right? I wanted to come here with everyone before leaving the village."

"Yeah! It's amazing, Carla! I'm really glad to be here with everyone!"

"Thank you, Sue. Even after we part, please don't forget about us. I don't want you to forget."

<b>

I could feel Carla's grip tightening on my hand.

<b>

"I won't forget! There's no way I could forget...! I don't want to... say goodbye!"

<b>

I shouted back, holding her hand tightly as she started to say something that would loosen her tear ducts.

<b>

<b>

Then, suddenly, another hand came from behind, wrapped around my shoulder, and whispered in my ear.

<b>

"Thank you, I will never forget either. My cute little baby."

<b>

I felt my hair stand on end, and Carla's corkscrew curls seemed to shrink at the same time.

<b>

With a squelching sound, something was crushed, and "it" was sent flying backward.

<b>

"Who are you?! Where did you come from?!!"

<b>

Carla took a stance and glared at "it" with sharp eyes.

She was completely in battle mode.

<b>

<b>

"It" casually brushed back its beautiful platinum blonde hair as if nothing had happened.

<b>

"Come on, distance or location doesn't matter for us who love each other. Asking where I'm from is a meaningless question, don't you think?"

<b>

While looking down, "it" spoke nonsensical words, but there was a steady flow of nosebleed coming out!

<b>

Hearing the commotion, everyone gathered around.

<b>

"Victor!? What are you doing here!?"

"What do you mean!? Why are you here?!"

<b>

Victor answered Alicia and Jessica's questions.

<b>

"There's no need for a reason to meet the one I love. The time apart nurtures love. My little girl."

<b>

I feel like I've heard that line somewhere before... but he returned it from behind Dana.

<b>

He pressed himself against Dana's back, gently holding her left wrist with his left hand, and slid his right hand around her waist from behind... then rested his chin on Dana's right shoulder while blowing softly into her ear.

<b>

"Meegyaaaahhh!!!"

<b>

Oh, I could clearly see Dana's hair standing on end.

<b>

Immediately after, Dana swung down a stick-like object she had taken out from somewhere with great force.

It slid out like a folding baton and became a short spear!

<b>

Dana quickly spun the spear and struck it into Victor's side.

<b>

Crunch, crack!!

<b>

With a cracking sound, something broke or crumbled, and Victor's body bent into a "k" shape and was sent flying.

He crashed into the nearby bushes, and something hit a large tree, making a loud noise and shaking it.

<b>

"Everyone, stay alert! That wasn't the end of it!"

<b>

Jessica called out to everyone, giving instructions.

<b>

"Dana! Keep an eye on the north where it flew off! Carla! You watch the south from that spot! Alicia! You take the west! Colin, stick with Dana! Bibi, stick with Alicia! I'll be with Carla! Each of you provide support and watch! Mia! Don't leave Sue's side! Its target is definitely Sue!!!"

<b>

W-What is this intense focus and tension, like a team working together? It's more intense than when we all went hunting in the forest at the beginning of the month!

Everyone's eyes are scary!

<b>

<b>

"What the hell! Why did it suddenly show up here... I don't get it!"

<b>

Dana muttered while keeping an eye on the surroundings...

<b>

"Well, it really was a coincidence. I came here to make memories with my sisters before parting, and then I found my honey gathered together. Don't you think that's fate? Hey? My little girl."

<b>

Victor began to speak while hugging Dana's waist.

Dana's eyes widened in surprise as she looked at Victor.

Oh no! I just saw Victor's hand stroke Dana's bottom!

<b>

"Yaaaahhh!!!"

<b>

Wow! For once, a girlish scream came from Dana's mouth!!

<b>

Dana's eyes filled with tears as she swung the short spear rapidly, but the spear cut through the air uselessly.

Victor was already gone.

<b>

"What we need is not to fight, but to love each other. Don't you think so, my darling?"

<b>

While confirming Victor's whereabouts, he pulled Alicia's arm from behind, hugging her as he whispered something like a love warrior.

<b>

"What you need is a direct and educational guidance through physical language!!!"

<b>

Alicia hooked her elbow around Victor's neck and pulled him down to the right.

At the same time, she swept his legs out from under him, flipping him over to the right.

<b>

However, before his body hit the ground, Victor was already gone.

<b>

Carla seemed to sense something and climbed up the tall coniferous tree nearby, twisting around the trunk and branches.

She stood on a branch about 15 meters above the ground, carefully scanning the area below.

<b>

"If you're going to speak the same words, let's share those lovely lips while speaking words of love. My sweet heart."

<b>

Victor hugged Carla from behind, leaning his mouth closer to hers while continuing to speak nonsense!

<b>

Carla slipped out of Victor's arms, circled around behind him, and wrapped her arms around him to restrain him.

Then, in a suplex-like manner, she dropped him headfirst toward the ground!!

<b>

Ahhh! No, that's the Ninja Technique "I-Tsunagi Drop!" Carla! That technique shouldn't be used while wearing a skirt!!!

<b>

"You should be kissing the ground instead!!!"

<b>

Just before Victor's head made contact with the ground, Carla released him and spun in mid-air before landing on the ground.

<b>

At almost the same time, Victor's head hit the ground with a thud.

<b>

However! His figure left a dent in the earth but then vanished!

What is this person!? This disappearing act and immortality! Are they really human!?

<b>

"If we're going to exchange kisses, it's a man's duty to teach the sweetness of love to these lovely lips, don't you think? My baby."

<b>

Before I knew it, Victor had come close to my left cheek, placing his right hand on my face and leaning in.

<b>

Ah... his face... a man's face is so close, his breath is hitting my cheek... why? Why can't I move my body?

Ahh... his breath touched my nose... my thoughts... are stopping...

<b>

Mekyomikibakikyo!!!

<b>

With a strange sound, a beautiful leg rotated into Victor's face.

Then, his neck was twisted, and he was buried into his own body.

<b>

Alicia's spinning kick exploded into Victor's face, sending him flying! Seriously, that kick is amazing!!

<b>

I was freed from Victor and let out a huge breath.

It seems I had forgotten to breathe.

My heart was racing... my heart was pounding at an incredible speed.

I could hear the beating in my ears.

<b>

I instinctively felt weak and almost collapsed to my knees.

<b>

"S-Sue-chan, are you okay?! Sue-chan!!"

<b>

Mia caught me.

Mia looked worriedly into my face, calling my name repeatedly.

<b>

Why didn't I notice his approach? Normally, if I had awareness of my actions, I shouldn't have missed it...

<b>

Speaking of which... I remember a junior saying once...

<b>

"I heard that even a monster-like teacher can get hit by a surprise attack. Well, it seems to be from a child. Apparently, a two-year-old nephew's toy hit the sitting teacher's head. If someone has awareness of attack or action, they can sense it. But a pure and innocent child's strike is something even the teacher couldn't detect."

<b>

If that's the case, then his actions are pure and innocent, without any ulterior motives...

<b>

What is that? It's even scarier!

<b>

Is it like acting purely on primal instincts and reflexes without any desire or malice?

No! That's really creepy and scary!!

I instinctively hugged my shoulders and shivered.

<b>

"Were you that scared, Sue-chan? It's okay now, okay?"

<b>

Mia said as she hugged me tightly.

Ah, this warmth and the pleasant softness of her flesh calmed me down.

For now, I won't think about anything and just bury myself in this blissful fat.

<b>

"S-Sue-chan... um, um, did we... touch lips...?"

<b>

I involuntarily reacted and looked up at Mia.

<b>

"Ah! S-Sorry! Did I remind you? I'm sorry!"

"No, it's not that! We didn't touch! So it's okay!"

"Really?! Really?... I'm glad, I'm really glad... Sue-chan's first time... was okay, right? I'm glad..."

<b>

Mia hugged me again as she said that.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

I could feel the angry fighting spirit raging behind me.

<b>

It was the older girls.

Since I was hugging Mia, I couldn't see directly, but I could sense the tremendous fighting spirit erupting.

<b>

"VICTOR!!! Are you prepared...?!"

"Today, I'm going to crush you for real? ...I'll grind you to dust!!!"

"Y-You even touched her bottom!! And on top of that, you did that to Sue!!!"

<b>

"Colin, Bibi. You two go find Mary and Shelly. That idiot must have left his sisters behind. Oh, and try to take a long way to avoid showing them what happens next."

<b>

Boom! Boom! Boom!!! A tremendous sound of impact began to echo.

Intense sounds of strikes and destruction reverberated continuously.

<b>

<b>

I stared at Mia while thinking.

<b>

Even though I have memories of being a boy, I am now in a girl's body, and my girlish feelings are growing.

If I continue to grow like this, I might eventually start to perceive men as the opposite sex and engage in such acts.

<b>

But right now, that's too much!

It's too soon to accept men as the opposite sex, and the hurdle is too high for me.

<b>

I need to prepare my heart thoroughly before I can do that!

I think that, yet... just having a man's face come so close makes my body tense up... it's true that Victor is handsome enough to make my heart race just by looking at his face...

Just having his mouth come closer makes my heart race faster, and is my body reacting on its own?

<b>

Could it be that I'm the type who can't resist when pressured?

Is the time for that coming sooner than I thought?

I can't prepare my heart in a literal sense!

<b>

If only I could have soft lips like Mia's... if only such a gentle mouth would touch my lips... such a beautiful...

<b>

"...Sue-chan?"

<b>

I snapped back to reality.

Did she notice my gaze? Did I have a greedy look on my face?

Feeling restless, I buried my face in Mia's chest to hide my embarrassment.

<b>

"...Hey, Sue-chan. Show me your face?"

<b>

I shook my head while burying my face in Mia's chest.

I know what kind of expression I'm making right now.

I can't show Mia this face!

<b>

"Please, Sue-chan... I want to see it."

<b>

Mia's hands spread to cradle my cheeks, and her fingertips gently caressed the nape of my neck.

<b>

"Hyahh! Nn!"

<b>

Ah! If you touch me there like that...!

My body jumped up, and my face was lifted toward Mia.

Mia cupped my cheeks, turning my face toward her.

<b>

My breath is quickening... my cheeks are flushed, and I can feel my eyes glistening.

Right now, I must look incredibly lewd.

<b>

"Sue-chan... ah, Sue-chan! I've never seen such a cute face on you..."

"â€¦N-No!"

<b>

So embarrassing!

I'm so embarrassed that I want to hide my face, but Mia is peering into my face...

My shame makes my cheeks redden even more, and my heart beats faster.

Surely, Mia can feel my heartbeat too.

<b>

I felt my knees weaken and almost collapse, so I wrapped my arms around Mia's back and clung to her.

Then Mia's face came even closer...

At this rate... no, I can't help but stare at Mia's lips.

My own lips began to part slightly, as if expecting something against my will.

<b>

"Sue... cha... n..."

<b>

For a brief moment, I felt a soft touch on my lips.

<b>

It was warm and felt like it enveloped me, and I felt like I might melt away.

<b>

But it was only for a moment, and that sensation quickly faded away.

<b>

I wanted to stay like that... just a little longer...

<b>

"â€¦Ah."

<b>

As something pulled away from my lips, I let out a wistful sound.

<b>

Right now, my eyes are following Mia's lips as they drift away.

<b>

Mia, who cupped my face with both hands, smiled gently...

<b>

"Is this... Sue-chan's first time...?"

<b>

She asked happily.

<b>

"â€¦Nn."

<b>

I looked away from Mia, feeling too embarrassed.

<b>

"â€¦Could it be that... you didn't like it...? Did you... come to dislike me...?"

<b>

Mia pulled her hands away from my cheeks, saying that sadly.

I quickly turned to face Mia.

<b>

"I don't! I don't dislike you! I like you...!"

<b>

I denied it vehemently, but if I say I don't dislike or hate her, it feels like I would want more or that it would be taken away.

<b>

Moreover, I just said I like her!

It's too embarrassing! I could feel my face turning red and looked down.

<b>

"Thank you, Sue-chan. I love you too..."

<b>

Saying that, she cupped my cheeks again, gently rubbed our foreheads together, and kissed the tip of our noses, then hugged me tightly.

<b>

"â€¦Nn."

<b>

Ah, won't she kiss me again?

I let out a breath without thinking.

<b>

Did I have a greedy look on my face?

Mia had a smile on her face that I had never seen before, one that was filled with joy.

<b>

Her eyes, the first time I saw them, were so enchanting that I couldn't meet her gaze.

It felt like she could see through the base desires within me, making me feel restless.

<b>

But I wanted to see more.

I wanted to be seen.

<b>

I placed my hands on top of Mia's hands that were cradling my face and rubbed my cheek against her hands.

Mia's eyes narrowed even more with happiness.

<b>

Ah, I love this look...

<b>

The thoughts that had occupied my mind about Victor and my future with men faded away.

<b>

In the distance, the rumbling continued to echo.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Afterward, Victor, who was restrained, was wrapped up in ropes and hung upside down from a high branch like a caterpillar, finally calming down.

<b>

After reuniting with Mary and Shelly, we enjoyed lunch by the water with a total of ten people and had a great time in the flower garden by the water before returning to the village.

<b>

After returning to the village, I remembered that we had left Victor hanging, but well, it's fine since it's him.

I immediately deleted that thought from my mind.

<b>

My perception of him finally aligned with everyone else's.

<b>

That night, I couldn't fall asleep for a long time.

I thought about various things, and my fantasies or wishes swirled around in my head, leading me to do various things more than usual.

<b>

Ah, what am I... where am I trying to go?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

With only three days left of summer vacation, that day, Carla and the others headed to the Dekkenbell High School dormitory.

<b>

We went to see them off at the stagecoach stop in Coop Town.

<b>

I hugged Carla, Alicia, and Jessica in turn, bidding them farewell.

I also shook hands with the Arrows. Victor might have been there too, but I couldn't see him.

<b>

Just before their departure, when I said goodbye to the three of them again, Carla suddenly said, "Well then, goodbye," and something welled up inside me, and I blurted out that I didn't want to say goodbye, tears streaming down my face.

<b>

After that, my vision blurred with tears, and since I clung to Mia, I didn't quite understand what was happening.

<b>

It seems the three older girls also started crying, saying things like, "I won't go!" and "I'm taking Sue with me!" and "I won't let go!" causing quite a commotion.

<b>

<b>

Even so, the stagecoach departed on time, and I waved back at Carla and the others, tears overflowing as I said goodbye.

<b>

<b>

That day, the adults around us planned an overnight event at Mia's house to comfort me, who was heartbroken.

<b>

Indeed, my loneliness was healed, and it turned into an incredibly stimulating overnight stay...

I can't say how I was comforted... there's no way I could say!!!

<b>

Thus, my first summer in Amukamu passed, making me grow just a little.

<b>

Eventually, the month changed, and the new school year began on the first week of the 5th Blue Moon.

<b>

<b>

<b>

And three days after the new semester began.

In the middle of that week, he came to the village.

The story begins to move.

Next time: "The Guest of the Cloud Family"
