# 35 Howard Cloud's Roar

1 choke point*15:30

<blank>

Howard Cloud was not alone in sensing something at that moment.

Several people rattled off their chairs and got up from the table.

<blank>

At about the same time, alarm bells rang.

It is sounded from the watchtower of this tsumesho.

The sound is played five times each.

<blank>

5 bells..., Marcel! Get another man up to see what's going on! Gary, get the men below to gear up. The ones who are ready will be on perimeter watch! Don't let him go alone! Always have at least three men on the ground!

<blank>

Howard stood up and let the instructions fly.

<blank>

Gokouzu! This..., this can't be 5 bells!"

<blank>

Ryder approached Howard and warned him in a hushed voice.

<blank>

I know. Rider, get your gear ready. Marcel! Tell Monomi to look around the village, not just in the woods! Gary! How many men are in the cell now?

<blank>

Howard gives instructions while he himself, with the help of those around him, puts on his equipment.

He wears boot-like shin guards over his slacks, a breastplate that covers the left half of his chest over a cut shirt, and an armplate that is integrated into his left arm up to the shoulder pads, through which his arm is secured to the breastplate. On the right arm, he wears an armplate that extends to the elbow and a cuirass.

<blank>

All of them are light and solid leather armor made of layers and layers of leather from magical beasts.

In addition, steel studs and plates are fitted to make it more robust.

Everywhere on the leather armor, there were many layers of magical symbols, like solemn decorations.

<blank>

By channeling magic power into this magic seal, the wearer's basic abilities are improved, and the defenses of the leather armor are also greatly increased.

If I had run into a boa with this equipment at the beginning of the summer, I would have beaten him straight to the punch without hesitation.

<blank>

And the weapon in his hand is a large sword, Zweihender.

He carries it on his dorsal side and his favorite longsword hangs from his waist.

<blank>

<blank>

As soon as Howard and Ryder were equipped, the alarm bells were sounded again.

The bells are struck several times, four times and twice separately.

<blank>

'Report! Confirmed hostiles! Shadow Dock swarms totaling approximately 30!

<blank>

Using the magic tool of voice transmission, a voice reaching from the thing-watch echoed in the room.

<blank>

<blank>

4-2 bells, 30? Gary! Bring up all the fence protection you can find! Rider! Take the lead! Marcel! Get them out of the way! I'll see to it!

<blank>

After sending out a flurry of instructions, Howard ran out and climbed up the ladder of the watchtower in one bound.

The watchtower was about three meters square, and the three young men in it were startled by Howard's sudden appearance and their eyes widened.

<blank>

Give it to me! I'll check it out."

<blank>

With that, he pushed away those who were there and placed his right hand on the stone slab attached to the tower.

This is a stone tablet with 'search magic' in it.

It is a magical tool that allows the operator to communicate the situation captured by the "magical tools of exploration" placed throughout the forest through this tool.

In the watchtower, he always monitors the movement of the forest by using his eyesight and this "search-and-rescue board".

Now Howard was focusing his attention and examining the information the grimoire was sending him.

<blank>

Eventually, Howard, who had been half-blind, opened his eyes with a start.

<blank>

'You fools! What's 30? It's not less than a hundred! And more are coming from the sky!

<blank>

The person who was handling the "search-and-destroy board" suddenly lost his color and began to tremble.

The other two men paled in the same way.

Perhaps the sheer number of opponents could not keep up with the processing of exploration magic by this young group of people.

This is due to inexperience.

Knowing this, Howard does not pursue the matter further. He places his hand on the trembling young man's shoulder.

<blank>

Now focus. Don't panic, okay? You're the one who has to concentrate and keep track of what's going on in the forest. And report back to Marcel. Marcel will not entrust this place to someone who can't do it! Can you do it?

<blank>

In a calm voice, he looks the young man in the eye and speaks to him as if telling him.

<blank>

The young man who was tapped on the shoulder nodded his head vigorously and said, "I'll do it!　He shouted, "I'll do it!

Howard nodded back, to the other two.

<blank>

'They're coming from the sky. It's coming here, too! You guys have to protect him, even if you can't see him!"

<blank>

Both of them reply at the same time, "Hi!　at the same time.

<blank>

'MARSALES! They come from the sky! Three more! Get them up there with bows and arrows! And don't forget the spears! The rest of the archers, deploy east and west! Get all the javelins you can out there! Raise the smoke signal! Three red! Type 3 Special Alert! Ring the bells!

<blank>

<blank>

Howard shouted out a series of instructions again, put his hand on the handrail of the tower, and fluttered out of the building.

The three remaining men on the watch shouted, "Ah!　Howard descends the five-meter high wall of the turret and lands on the roof of the choke point.

<blank>

He used all of his body's firing power to cushion the impact, and with the momentum he carried, he ran down the roof and jumped further to the first-floor eaves.

Then they descended directly to the ground. The three men on top of the watch stood frozen, their eyes wide open.

<blank>

Gary! Bring the Javelin!!!!"

<blank>

<blank>

Howard stood staring into the forest with his back against the jammed house.

The area between the Tsumesho and the forest was approximately 20 meters square, and in front of the Tsumesho, a 5-meter wide path was opened and extended into the forest.

<blank>

On both sides of the road, the edge of the forest is lined with an endless series of defensive fences made of thick logs hammered into the ground to block the trees.

Behind the Tsumesho, a similar, though much older, defensive fence runs parallel to the forest.

<blank>

The distance between these fences is the area that the villagers have gained by clearing the forest in roughly the last half century.

<blank>

<blank>

The Amkam forest is the end of a magical landmass where the Irosio Great Forest is constantly eroding.

If the forest is not constantly cultivated and the magical beasts are not exterminated, the villages adjacent to the forest will eventually be encroached upon by this great forest.

<blank>

If there is no one to hold back the forest, this place could easily be buried under it.

<blank>

<blank>

Fifty years ago, the Amcam forest was up to where the protective fence was behind us.

I have no intention of letting the demonic beasts that are now approaching from the forest easily push back the territory that I have gained over the past 50 years.

<blank>

Howard stood with his arms crossed and a stern look on his face, staring deep into the forest as javelins were thrust around him.

<blank>

<blank>

A mature man in full leather armor and a black beard approached Howard.

<blank>

The strength of the group is 21 low-ranking members, 10 medium-ranking members, and 7 high-ranking members, including myself and the head of the group, for a total of 38 members. More than half are of low rank.

<blank>

and Gary Meyers reports the number of group members with a serious look in his eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

"Hmmm! Almost half of the upper-middle ranks?"

<blank>

Howard sniffs absentmindedly.

At that moment, a voice came through the magical device of voice transmission.

<blank>

Report! Shadowdog 120, Brutal Butt 70! Shadowdog approaching from the forest road in front, about 60, and 30 each in the woods to the east and west! 30 Brutal Butt in front and 20 in the east and west!

<blank>

Good job! Well done! Good job!

<blank>

Howard raised his fist in the air and flew into a fury at the report of the objectivity.

Thank you very much from the top of the tower!　comes a happy voice.

And then the rider approached as well.

<blank>

<blank>

"Your Highness, this number..."

How do you see it?" Ryder, Gary. Do you think this is some sort of hexenbiest run amok or stampede?"

I don't believe it! Such a controlled movement?"

<blank>

Gary denies that it's possible.

<blank>

If there were multiple species of magical beasts running amok, that would be understandable. But this group is clearly operating under a single will."

<blank>

Ryder replies as he looks out into the forest.

<blank>

<blank>

I think so, too. There is definitely someone's will. The timing of the attack was very convenient, as most of the mainstays of the village were gone. Henry is not in the village either. The priest's prayer at the altar cannot create a large scale protective shield. Is this a coincidence? What do you think? What do you think they're after?

"Eradication of the village ......, is it?"

<blank>

Gary, with hostility evident in his eyes, asks back.

<blank>

I suppose that's true in the end. However, it is too much to ask for the extermination of a village with this level of force! The purpose of these people who are on their way here now is probably to stop us in our tracks. Which means... there they are, the main force!

<blank>

Gary and Ryder's expressions became even harsher at Howard's words.

<blank>

I doubt this is all there are of these dogs, but what we have to do now is to exterminate the oncoming enemies as quickly as possible. But with such a large area, it will be impossible to stop all of them.

<blank>

Then Howard cowered his shoulders.

<blank>

So leave the loose ends alone. Leave them to the villagers. We are not chasing after the ones that have slipped out, but to slaughter as many as possible that are coming toward us.

Is that what the special alert is for?"

Yes, that's right! If anyone underestimates the people of the village of Amkam, let them know that this village is not so easy!

<blank>

Howard fishes out his beard-filled mouth and speaks with a fierce smile.

Gary and Ryder, seeing this, smiled as if caught in the act.

<blank>

<blank>

The "little boys of low rank may be too much for them, but for those of middle and high rank, killing one each is nothing to worry about, right? What, twenty kills a man will be enough to make up the difference.

<blank>

Can you afford it?　Howard asked smilingly.

<blank>

Your Highness is as strict as ever.

<blank>

Oh no, Gary laughs and scratches his head.

<blank>

<blank>

What, 20 is too much? I can clean up half of them if you want. Hmm?

I'm not going to let that happen, head of the church! Half of them are mine!"

<blank>

Ryder smiles at Howard's playful suggestion.

<blank>

<blank>

'Hmph, then you're the mainstay, Ryder. Slaughter them in the front line! I will shoot through the air from here until the javelins run out! After that, I'm going to play. Gary, make sure the lower ranks are in groups of three! Make sure the dogs are stalled and killed! They're coming. Go! As soon as the battle commences, sound the first alarm, and ring two bells!

<blank>

Ha," they bowed, and Gary and Ryder ran to their stations!　Gary and Ryder bow and run off to their posts.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Howard drew the Zweihender he carried on his back and thrust the tip of his sword into the ground.

He pulls out the nearest javelin and plays with it in his hand once or twice to check its weight and balance.

Then he slowly turned his chest and swung his javelin.

Nuh-uh!　The muscles of the entire body exploded for that split second, and like a cannonball being shot out, the javelin was thrown forward and diagonally upward into the sky.

<blank>

Javelin jumps straight ahead in a straight line.

Just as it was about to strike the forest, a Brutal Bat suddenly appeared out of the trees, easily piercing and shooting down the body of the Brutal Bat.

<blank>

<blank>

Brutal bat, a huge bat, about one meter long, with a wingspan of almost five meters.

It has a black body color and long, sharp fangs in its mouth with an elongated nasal surface.

It is ferocious in nature, one of those vicious demonic beasts that pounces on any prey it catches sight of and sticks its fangs into it.

<blank>

The great black bat falls to the ground, emitting a high-pitched, strangled sound, and dies.

As if on cue, the beasts came running out of the forest one after another.

<blank>

<blank>

Shadowdogs, as their name suggests, are shadowy black, long-furred mountain dogs.

The ferocious demonic beasts, which attack their prey in packs, now come running through the forest of Amkamu in large groups, their red eyes shining and their fangs bared.

<blank>

<blank>

The forest road was quickly covered with shadow docks.

However, the rider cuts down the shadowdogs approaching in front of him one after another with a single stroke of his sword.

Others followed suit, striking the shadow dock as it tried to get through the forest road.

The bats passing overhead were pierced one by one by Howard's javelin and shot down with arrows by those equipped with bows.

<blank>

The space in front of the Tsumesho was suddenly enveloped in a clamor and turned into a battlefield with blood splattering.

In the midst of the battlefield, alarm bells were struck violently, twice each, and rang out into the village.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"Do not neglect the search for the enemy! Keep your eyes on all directions! Don't miss anything!

<blank>

Howard heads to the sight and raises his voice, and a reply of understanding comes from the top of the turret.

After throwing all 20 or so javelins he had, Howard pulled out a Zweighender that had been propped up and ran straight to the front line.

He is a true demon as he easily maneuvers his large sword, which is as tall as he is and as heavy as he is, through his physique to cut down both shadowdogs one after another.

<blank>

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw one low-ranked person fall.

Then, without a second thought, three shadowdogs pounced on them and tried to poke their fangs into the ground.

Howard draws a longsword from his waist, throws it at one of the tusked animals, and thrusts the longsword into its flank.

Running at the same time as he threw the longsword, he swung the zweihender with one right hand, cutting the torso of the second head in two.

He continued to swing his left fist down and shattered the spinal cord of the third animal.

<blank>

The armor of the upper and middle ranks will not pass through the fangs of a shadow dock.

But at low ranks, the magic power that can be kneaded into the armor is poor.

It is not expected to be that strong.

<blank>

No need to push forward! Make sure you're on the defensive, and make sure you kill them one by one with your buddies!"

<blank>

Howard took one look at the fallen low-ranked man being helped up by his companions, said a few words as he retrieved his longsword, and went on to his next prey.

<blank>

<blank>

Rider Haggard continues to wield his knight's sword, which he has loved since his days as a knight.

The blood-bleeding grooves along the blade are decorated with magical marks, and as long as the user continues to apply magical power to the blade, it can be clothed in holy chi, strengthened, and wielded without losing its cutting ability.

<blank>

After all, they are four-legged beasts.

Simply slashing off the front legs can take away mobility.

It has no solid armor, and if you put a blade through it, you can inflict a fatal wound.

The only thing left is how to slay them efficiently.

Violence in numbers? Such things are irrelevant.

<blank>

A Haggard man does not back down once he has faced the enemy!

<blank>

He told Howard with a big mouth that half of them were his prey.

At the very least, it will cut down all the black waves that are approaching in front of you!

If that is not enough, I will have to go after the rest of the shadow dogs scattered to the left and right.

The men of Haggard are not warm enough to be intimidated by a pack of beasts of this size," said the rider, baring his teeth in a ferocious grin and sending blood splattering from one end to the other! and the rider bared his teeth in a ferocious grin and went splattering blood from one end to the other.

<blank>

<blank>

'Smoke rounds confirmed! Black and yellow! It's the second jam!

<blank>

The voice from the magical tool of voice transmission echoes through the air.

<blank>

Noooo, I knew it!

<blank>

As Howard slashed down the shadow dog, he turned his eyes to the eastern sky.

I saw a column of black and yellow smoke rising in the sky beyond.

The black and yellow wolfsbane means that the magical beast has breached the protective fence of the Tsumesho.

<blank>

(It's been a half hour since the battle started....)

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, Zawari and Howard felt something running down their spines.

Immediately, he glances sharply at the end of the forest road.

<blank>

Raidaaaaahhh! Get down!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

He slashes away at the shadow dogs in front of him, trying to get to the front lines while warning the riders loudly.

At the same time, a rider was sent flying to the entrance of the forest road as if something had hit him.

The rider quickly used the belly of his nightsword as a shield to catch the impact and jumped backward.

Although he was thrown backward, the rider caught the ground with both legs, stepped on the brakes, and immediately regained his fighting stance.

<blank>

<blank>

Zawari, a shadow seemed to overflow from the forest road.

<blank>

I'm surprised. I'm surprised that anyone can stand this. I'm surprised.

<blank>

The shadow spoke the words.

Eventually, as the shadows began to take on human form, the air in the battlefield changed dramatically.

A heavy, nauseating stench of rottenness, a different dimension from the fresh smell of splattered flesh and blood that had pervaded the battlefield until now, enveloped the area, suffocating the people.

<blank>

<blank>

Lawrence, don't get ahead of yourself.

<blank>

Another shadow takes human form.

<blank>

Yes, Lawrence is always the first to make a move! It's not fair!

<blank>

Another shadow has been added.

<blank>

I mean, these dogs are almost wiped out! I knew it! The demographics here are pretty thick, you know?"

'Indeed, it would have been a good time for our intervention, wouldn't it?

Still, who gets first dibs is another story, don't you think?" Bernie has a soft spot for Lawrence."

<blank>

<blank>

The more shadows there are, the thicker the presence of evil thoughts becomes.

There are five figures in all, equally dressed in similar butler's uniforms and with silver hair.

They look like boys and girls who have taken on a beautiful form, but their presence is as poisonous as an impurity.

<blank>

The herd of demonic beasts had already been nearly destroyed.

The morale of the group was up and it looked like a winning battle.

<blank>

But the situation took a turn.

The low-ranking members of the group were engulfed by the presence and were unable to move.

Some of the middle ranks are also lacking in movement.

The surviving magical beasts, albeit only a few, made their way to the village.

The higher-ups are on high alert, looking for an opening to make a move.

<blank>

What is this? You've been depressing me for a while now!"

<blank>

The silver-haired butler's suit, which appears to be the last girl to appear, moves as if to brush away her own long hair.

<blank>

And then a cry went up from the top of the watch, as if it had been played.

<blank>

No! Get him away from the search board!

<blank>

It seems that a member of the group who was searching for a spot on the object fell into a coma.

The top management informed us that he was safe, though unconscious for the time being.

<blank>

<blank>

Marcel. "Marcel, there's no need to search anymore. Send the low-ranked men in pursuit of the hexenbiest."

<blank>

At Howard's direction, the low-ranking members of the group try to head for the village together....

<blank>

I'm not going to let you go.

<blank>

The first person to appear, a butler's outfit called Lawrence, waves his hand.

Then, the shadow at their feet lurched like a serpent, swiftly stretching out, piercing the shoulders and legs of the group members who were about to advance, and then the shadow disappeared as if dissolving in water.

Those whose bodies were pierced fell down on the spot and fainted in agony.

<blank>

Well, it disappears as soon as it hits the sun.

<blank>

The butler looked at the fallen with a wan smile and cowered his shoulders.

<blank>

"Lawrence, you know what I'm talking about. Don't let him die just yet."

I know, Ahab. I know what I'm doing.

<blank>

You!

<blank>

Howard makes no attempt to hide his anger, baring his teeth in a glare.

<blank>

Come on! Gentlemen, the starters are done! We'll take it from here!"

<blank>

The butler-suited man called Lawrence held out his hands and announced to those present, in a theatrical tone of voice.

The five butlers spread out in a line, and the shadows at their feet wiggle and writhe like ghosts.

Tension ran high among the group members. They regained their weapons and readied themselves seamlessly.

<blank>

<blank>

However, there was only one person among them who did not move and just kept staring at the silver-haired man called Lawrence with a furious expression on his face.

Ryder Haggard.

<blank>

It's you, ......, I won't forget you...I won't forget you!"

What's up? Rider."

<blank>

Howard, keeping his eyes on the butlers, puts his hand on Ryder's shoulder as he squeezes his voice and asks him a question.

<blank>

Goto ......, no, Mr. Cloud. It's him, I'm sure of it! I'm sure it's him!

Rider?"

Ten years ago! He was the one holding me back! This face, this voice! I'll never forget it!

<blank>

<blank>

It revives in the mind of the rider.

The scenes, the emotions, the taste of blood in my mouth.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In a thunderous roar, the altar of the temple was destroyed, and the head of the temple was blown to pieces and under rubble.

Many children were sacrificed in front of my eyes, and the members of the group who were supposed to be my bodyguards were all beaten to death in an attempt to stop them.

Myself and Ravi were also angered and stood up to them, but they were easily overpowered.

<blank>

You..! Get off me! Let go of me, you son of a bitch!

"Shut up, it's going to be your turn soon, so just be a big boy and wait."

<blank>

The rider's restrained head is pushed further to the floor and he bites the sand.

<blank>

Damn! Lavie! Lavie!

What? Do you care about her that much? Then why don't you watch? It won't take long, okay?"

<blank>

The rider was stomped on his back, grabbed by the hair while he was unable to move, and forced to raise his head.

A moan escaped.

I was made to look up, and there was Lavinia Cloud.

<blank>

Lavinia seemed to be floating in mid-air, her body turned up in the air.

But an arm was inserted into its waist, and it was supported by that single arm.

Lavinia's body is motionless, as if held in place by an invisible force.

<blank>

Droplets of blood were dripping onto the floor, creating a pool of blood.

Lavinia's right arm was twisted in a strange direction and hung down without power.

Blood was dripping down his arm in multiple streaks, as if the bone had broken through the skin from there.

<blank>

Despite such a serious injury, she had not lost the power of her eyes.

He was looking at the rider with powerful eyes.

<blank>

Ravi...damn it! Lavi! Ravi!

"Rider ......"

Ravi." Damn it! I'll save you now! Hold on, Ravi! Damn it! Let go of me! Let go of me, damn it! Ravi! God damn it. ！！！！"

<blank>

The leg that is stomping on the rider presses him to the floor with even more force.

<blank>

Ha-ha-ha! You idiot, there's no way I can help you! Watch where you're going!"

Fuck." Damn! Fuck! ......!"

<blank>

Tears well up in Ryder's eyes and his vision is distorted.

I grit my teeth and press my face against the floor, spilling out tears of frustration as I go.

<blank>

Ravi ......! Damn... oh."

Rider!

<blank>

Lavinia's voice, with its power and warmth, causes the rider to look at her.

<blank>

"Rider ...... please, please... don't give up! Protect... everyone, please! Rider...ahhhhh! Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh! ！！！！！！"

<blank>

The ringleader of this scourge thrust his fangs into Lavinia's throat.

Her voice continues to resonate as if squeezed out forever.

Eventually, his voice trailed off and his skin turned as white as wax, as if he had lost his blood.

<blank>

Lavinia's body was thrown to the floor.

The one who had stuck his fangs into her mouth moved his mouth around, and soon a beautiful red ball, the size of a pinky finger, was placed on the tip of his blood-red tongue.

I pick it up with my fingertips and look into it as if I could see through the light.

<blank>

I've never seen such a beautiful star pearl before! I have never seen such a beautiful star pearl! Such pure clarity and ...... magic power, so fine and rich...perfect! I've never seen anything like it! It's amazing! I can't believe I got such a bargain! This village is the best! Hahaha! Hahahaha!

<blank>

Orbet Mash. True Vampire who eats children and gains star beads.

He is the ringleader of this tragedy.

<blank>

The "Star Pearl" is a mass of magical power and life force that seals and solidifies the astral body and manas, and contains the radiance of the person's soul.

<blank>

Orbet is now excitedly extolling the virtues of the best of the best it has got.

<blank>

Congratulations! Mr. Orbet."

Thank you, Laurence. This is the best day of my life."

<blank>

At the feet of Lawrence, who congratulates him, Ryder scrambles to his feet.

<blank>

'Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ！！！！ La villa villa villa villa! Chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick-chick! You, you, you, you, you! I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you, you ah! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! God damn it! Lavi! Lavilavieeeeeeeeee! ！！！！"

<blank>

Looking down at the rider who continues to struggle to his feet on the floor, Orbet...

<blank>

What? This one is boiling down nicely, too! It's good! I have high expectations for today! It's going to be a really great day.

<blank>

The rider stares at Orbet and continues to grumble.

I could feel my head turning red with anger.

However, this was shortly followed by the sight of the wall behind Orbette bursting open with a white light.

<blank>

The next time he regained consciousness was a week after the tragedy.

Lavinia had already never returned.

<blank>

Ryder continued to cry aloud in front of her gravestone....

With a final promise to her.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

"What is it? Lawrence, do I know you?"

You know what? It was a long time ago, wasn't it? I don't remember everything. I don't know."

'That's true. It's more unusual for me to remember."

<blank>

The silver butlers continue their conversation in a languid manner.

As the rider watches, a deep, intense crease is carved into his brow.

The teeth are bound together so tightly that they almost make a gurgling sound.

<blank>

<blank>

"Rider...no way, no way this guy is ......?"

<blank>

Just as Howard was about to ask the rider, the sound of bells rang out from within the village.

It is not a heavy sound like the alarm bells that are rung by the bell tower, but a clear and resonant bell.

However, despite its clear tone, the bell was rung again and again with such vigor that it sounded as if there was not a moment to spare.

<blank>

This bell...no way! Is it a school?

<blank>

Gary Meyers expressed surprise.

<blank>

"Well... if that's what these guys are... they're after the kids!"

<blank>

Howard stares at the butlers with a look of indignation.

And at the same time, an even deeper darkness flooded from the depths of it.

<blank>

It's really good timing, isn't it? Eliza and her team did a great job.

<blank>

A thick darkness takes shape.

Colorless white hair.

Cerulean blue eyes that seem to chill.

Black outerwear and white shirt.

On his chest, he wore a jabot with many folds like that of a nobleman, and in the center of it shone a jewel the same color as his eyes.

<blank>

The moment it appeared, the evil thoughts of the place grew deeper and denser, engulfing those who were there.

The low ranks lost their color and could not even move. Even those in the middle ranks could not stop sweating.

<blank>

In the midst of all this, a lone rider cries out.

<blank>

You! You! I will not forget! I will not forget! You! You!

<blank>

He becomes even more enraged and squeezes out his anger as if he were spitting blood from the bottom of his heart.

He grips his nightsword and goes low, ready to pounce at any moment.

<blank>

You're so rude out of the blue. Can I kill him? Lady Orbette?

<blank>

The butler's uniform, which takes the form of a girl with silver hair in a medium bob and a black ribbon wrapped around her head, grimly asks for permission.

<blank>

"Well, wait a minute, Lila. But it's funny... someone else knows me?"

<blank>

Orbet looked at the rider with amusement as he touched the jewel on his chest

<blank>

'Huh, well... this guy... this is the one, isn't it? Rider ......"

<blank>

Howard quietly asks Ryder.

<blank>

Yes, Mr. Cloud! This is the guy! This is the one! He's the one who took Ravi!

<blank>

Ryder also responds to Howard with a glare at Orbet.

<blank>

"Kuk, so kuk...kuk, kuk ......, so...so...finally, finally......... kuk."

<blank>

<blank>

What is this old man doing? He started laughing all of a sudden. Is this one of your acquaintances?

So I don't know!"
