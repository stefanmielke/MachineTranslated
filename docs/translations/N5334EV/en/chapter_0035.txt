# Episode 35: The Roar of Howard Cloud

The First Station * 15:30

<b>

At that moment, it wasn't just Howard Cloud who sensed something.

Several people pushed their chairs back with a clatter and stood up from the table.

<b>

Almost simultaneously, the alarm bells rang out.

They were being sounded from the watchtower of this station.

The bells rang five times in quick succession.

<b>

"Five bells... Marcel! Send another person up to the watch! Gary, have the others prepare their equipment. Those who are ready, take up perimeter watch! Don't let anyone go alone! Always have three or more act together!!"

<b>

Howard continued to issue commands.

<b>

"Chief! This... five bells means something different!"

<b>

Rider approached Howard and warned him in a hushed voice.

<b>

"I know. Rider, you prepare your equipment too. Marcel! Tell the watch to survey not just the forest but the entire village! Gary! How many members are currently at the station?"

<b>

As Howard issued commands, he also began to equip himself with the help of those around him.

He put on shin guards resembling boots over his slacks, attached a chest plate that covered the left half of his torso over his cut shirt, and slipped his arm into an arm guard that was integrated with a shoulder guard, securing it to the chest plate. On his right arm, he wore an elbow-length arm guard and gauntlets.

<b>

All of these were lightweight yet sturdy leather armor made from multiple layers of beast hide.

Additionally, iron studs and plates were embedded, making it even more robust.

And all over the leather armor, intricate magical seals were engraved, layered upon one another like majestic decorations.

<b>

By channeling magical power into these seals, the wearer's basic abilities were enhanced, and the defensive power of the leather armor was significantly increased.

If he had encountered a Boar in this gear at the beginning of summer, he would have knocked it down without hesitation.

<b>

The weapon he wielded was a large sword known as a Zweihänder.

He slung it across his back and hung his beloved longsword at his waist.

<b>

<b>

As Howard and Rider finished equipping themselves, the alarm bells rang out once more.

The bells were struck repeatedly, four times followed by two.

<b>

"Report! Enemy confirmed! Approximately 30 Shadow Dogs in total!"

<b>

The voice carried through the room using a voice transmission magical tool, echoing from the watch.

<b>

<b>

"Four-two bells? Thirty?! Gary! Bring out all the barricades! Rider! Take command at the front! Marcel! Clear the way! I want to see directly!"

<b>

Howard rapidly issued commands and dashed up the ladder of the watchtower in one go.

The watchtower was about three meters square, and the three young people there were startled by Howard's sudden arrival, their eyes wide open.

<b>

"Let me see! I'll confirm."

<b>

Saying this, he pushed aside those present and placed his right hand on the stone plate attached to the tower.

This was a stone plate imbued with "Detection Magic."

It allowed the operator to receive information captured by "Exploration Magical Tools" installed in various parts of the forest.

In the watchtower, they constantly monitored the movements in the forest using both visual observation and this "Detection Plate."

Now, Howard concentrated, scrutinizing the information sent by the magical tool.

<b>

Eventually, Howard, who had been half-lidded, suddenly opened his eyes wide.

<b>

"These fools! What do you mean thirty?! It's at least a hundred! And more are coming from above!!"

<b>

The person handling the "Detection Plate" instantly lost color and began to tremble.

The other two also turned pale in a similar manner.

It seemed that the sheer number of enemies overwhelmed the young member's ability to process the detection magic.

This was due to their lack of experience.

Understanding this, Howard did not press further. He placed a hand on the trembling young man's shoulder.

<b>

"Focus now. Don't panic. Just concentrate on grasping the movements in the forest. And report to Marcel as needed. If you can't do it, Marcel won't leave this place to you! Can you do it?"

<b>

Speaking in a calm voice while looking into the young man's eyes, he encouraged him.

<b>

The young man, having been patted on the shoulder, nodded vigorously and shouted, "I'll do my best!"

Howard nodded back and addressed the other two.

<b>

"They're coming from above too. They're coming here! You two keep an eye out while protecting him!"

<b>

The two replied simultaneously, "Yes!"

<b>

"Marcel!! They're coming from above! Bring up three more! Don't forget the spears! The remaining bows should be deployed east and west! Get all the javelins out! Launch smoke bombs! Three red ones!! This is a third-class special alert! Ring the bells—!!!"

<b>

<b>

Howard shouted out commands in rapid succession and then placed his hand on the railing of the tower, leaping out.

The three left in the watch tower exclaimed, "Ah!" but Howard descended the five-meter wall of the tower and landed on the roof of the station.

<b>

Using the springs in his body to cushion the impact, he carried that momentum down the roof and leaped down to the awning of the first floor.

Then he continued to descend to the ground. The three above the watch tower were wide-eyed and frozen.

<b>

"Gary! Bring the javelins!!"

<b>

<b>

Howard stood with his back to the station, glaring at the forest.

Between the station and the forest stretched an area of about twenty square meters, and in front of the station was a five-meter-wide path that extended into the woods.

<b>

On both sides of the path, thick logs had been driven in to form a defensive barricade, stretching endlessly.

Behind the station, there was a similarly aged barricade running parallel to the forest.

<b>

The distance between these barricades was an area gained by the villagers over the past half-century by clearing the forest.

<b>

<b>

The Amukam Forest is the edge of the magical realm, constantly being encroached upon by the Iroshio Great Forest.

Villages adjacent to the forest must continuously clear it and drive out magical beasts; otherwise, they will eventually be consumed by this great forest.

<b>

If no one remains to hold back the forest, it could easily be buried.

<b>

<b>

Fifty years ago, the Amukam Forest extended only to where the rear barricade now stands.

Now, facing the magical beasts approaching from the forest, he had no intention of letting them push back the territory gained over these fifty years.

<b>

As javelins were being planted around Howard, he stood with his arms crossed, glaring sternly into the depths of the forest.

<b>

<b>

Approaching Howard was a middle-aged man, also clad in leather armor, with a black beard.

<b>

"Chief, our forces consist of 21 low-ranked members, 10 mid-ranked members, and 7 high-ranked members including myself and you, totaling 38. More than half are low-ranked."

<b>

Gary Meyers reported the number of members with a serious expression.

<b>

<b>

"Hmph! There are nearly half high and mid-ranked members, aren't there?"

<b>

Howard snorted casually.

At that moment, a voice came from the voice transmission magical tool.

<b>

"Report! Enemies: 120 Shadow Dogs! 70 Brutal Bats! Approximately 60 approaching from the main forest path, with 30 each from the east and west forests arriving late! 30 Brutal Bats are approaching directly in front, with about 20 each from the east and west!"

<b>

"Alright! Well done! You assessed the situation well!!"

<b>

Howard raised his fist in response to the report from the watch.

From above the tower, a cheerful voice echoed, "Thank you very much!"

Just then, Rider also approached.

<b>

<b>

"Chief, this number..."

"What do you think, Rider, Gary? Do you think this is a rampage or a stampede of magical beasts?"

"Impossible! Such coordinated movements?"

<b>

Gary denied it, saying it was inconceivable.

<b>

"If multiple types of magical beasts were rampaging indiscriminately, I could understand. But this group is clearly moving under a single will."

<b>

Rider replied while gazing into the forest.

<b>

<b>

"Yes, I think so too. There is undoubtedly some will behind this. It's quite convenient that most of the village's main force is absent at this timing. Henry is also not in the village. We can't deploy a large-scale protective barrier through the priest's prayers at the altar. Is this a coincidence? Ha! What do you think their aim is?"

"The annihilation of the village...?"

<b>

Gary, showing hostility in his eyes, questioned back.

<b>

"Ultimately, that may be the case. However, to annihilate the village with this level of force is utterly absurd! The purpose of these creatures heading here is likely to delay us. Which means... the main force is here!"

<b>

Gary and Rider's expressions grew even more serious at Howard's words.

<b>

"It may be questionable whether these dogs are all there are, but what we must do now is to eliminate as many of the approaching enemies as quickly as possible. That said, with such a wide area, it would be impossible to stop them all."

<b>

Saying this, Howard shrugged.

<b>

"So let the ones that slip through be left alone. We'll leave those to the villagers. Our task is not to chase the ones that slip through but to slay as many of the ones coming at us as possible."

"Is that why there's a special alert?"

"Exactly! If there are those who underestimate the people of Amukam village, we should make them realize that this village is not easily dealt with!"

<b>

Howard's mouth curled into a fierce smile, and he revealed his teeth.

Seeing this, Gary and Rider couldn't help but smile in response.

<b>

<b>

"It might be a bit much for the low-ranked kids, but for the mid and high-ranked members, one kill each shouldn't be too much to ask, right? If each takes down twenty, we'll be fine."

<b>

Howard asked cheerfully, "Isn't that right?"

<b>

"The chief is as strict as ever."

<b>

Gary laughed while scratching his head.

<b>

<b>

"What? Is twenty too strict? If you want, I can take care of half of them myself, you know? Hmm?"

"That's not going to happen, Chief! Half of them are my prey!"

<b>

Rider playfully suggested, but Howard smiled and restrained him.

<b>

<b>

"Hmph, then you be the main force, Rider. Cut them down in the front row! I'll shoot at the sky with javelins until I run out! After that, I'll switch to skirmishing. Gary, make sure the low-ranked members act in groups of three! Have them hold back the dogs and ensure they take them down! They're coming soon. Go! Sound the first-class special alert! Ring the second bell!!"

<b>

With a "Yes!" Gary and Rider bowed and ran off to their respective positions.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Howard drew the Zweihänder slung across his back and thrust its tip into the ground.

He then pulled out a nearby javelin, weighing and balancing it in his hand a couple of times.

Then, with a deep breath, he arched his chest and raised the javelin overhead.

With a powerful explosion of muscle, the javelin was hurled diagonally upward.

<b>

The javelin flew straight ahead.

Just as it seemed it would embed itself among the branches of the forest, it suddenly pierced through the body of a Brutal Bat that had emerged from between the trees.

<b>

The Brutal Bat, about one meter in body length and nearly five meters in wingspan, was a massive bat.

With a black body and long, sharp fangs protruding from its elongated snout, it was a ferocious magical beast that attacked any prey in sight without discrimination.

<b>

The black giant bat let out a high-pitched scream as it fell to the ground, lifeless.

As if signaled by this, beasts began to leap out of the forest one after another.

<b>

The Shadow Dogs, as their name suggests, were dark as shadows and had long-haired mountain dog appearances.

A ferocious group of magical beasts was now charging through the Amukam Forest, their red eyes shining and fangs bared.

<b>

In no time, the forest path was completely covered by Shadow Dogs.

However, Rider cut down the approaching Shadow Dogs one after another with swift strikes.

The others followed suit, attacking the Shadow Dogs trying to break through the forest path.

The bats flying overhead were pierced one after another by Howard's javelins and shot down by archers.

<b>

The area in front of the station quickly became a cacophony, transforming into a battlefield splattered with blood.

In the midst of this battlefield, the alarm bells rang fiercely, striking twice in succession, echoing into the village.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Don't neglect detection! Keep visual observation in all directions! Never let anything slip by!"

<b>

Howard shouted towards the watch, and a reply of understanding came back from above.

Having thrown all the javelins, Howard drew the Zweihänder he had thrust into the ground and dashed toward the front line.

He wielded the large sword, which was comparable to his height and weight, with ease, cleaving through the Shadow Dogs one after another like a demon.

<b>

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a low-ranked member trip.

Three Shadow Dogs immediately pounced on him, aiming to sink their fangs into him.

Howard drew his longsword from his waist, threw it at one of the dogs aiming to bite, and thrust it into its side.

Simultaneously, he ran forward and swung the Zweihänder with one hand, cleaving through the second dog's body.

He then brought down his left fist, crushing the spine of the third dog.

<b>

With mid and high-ranked armor, the fangs of the Shadow Dogs would not penetrate.

But the low-ranked members lacked the magical power to reinforce their armor.

They couldn't expect that level of durability.

<b>

"There’s no need to push forward recklessly! Defend properly, and take down one dog at a time with your comrades!"

<b>

Howard glanced at the low-ranked member who had fallen, now being helped up by his comrades, and said this while retrieving his longsword, moving on to the next target.

<b>

<b>

Rider Haggard continued to wield his knight's sword, which he had cherished since his days in the knight order.

The blood grooves carved along the blade were adorned with magical seals, allowing the wielder to imbue it with magical power, enveloping it in holy energy, enhancing its strength, and maintaining its sharpness.

<b>

After all, the opponent was a four-legged beast.

By simply severing its front legs, its mobility could be taken away.

Without sturdy armor, a blade could deliver a fatal blow.

The only question was how efficiently to cut them down.

The violence of numbers? That was irrelevant.

<b>

Once Haggard faced an enemy, he would not retreat!

<b>

He had boasted that half of the kills were his prey.

At the very least, he would cut down every last one of the black wave approaching him!

If that wasn't enough, he would have to chase down the remaining shadow dogs scattered to the sides, he thought.

He was not the type to falter before such a group of beasts! With a fierce grin, Rider bared his teeth and splattered blood as he cut them down one by one.

<b>

<b>

"Smoke bomb confirmed! Black and yellow! Second station!"

<b>

The voice from the voice transmission magical tool echoed.

<b>

"Ugh, they broke through after all!"

<b>

Howard, while cutting down the shadow dogs, turned his gaze to the eastern sky.

He confirmed the rising columns of black and yellow smoke in the distance.

The black and yellow smoke indicated that the magical beasts had breached the station's defensive barricade.

<b>

(It's been about thirty minutes since the battle started... they held out well.)

<b>

At that moment, Howard felt a chill run down his spine.

He instinctively glared sharply into the depths of the forest.

<b>

"Rider!! Get down!!!"

<b>

As he warned Rider loudly, he slashed through the shadow dogs in front of him.

Almost simultaneously, Rider was flung back as if repelled to the entrance of the forest path.

Rider instinctively used the belly of his knight's sword as a shield, absorbing the impact and leaping backward.

Though he had been thrown back, Rider planted his feet firmly on the ground, bracing himself and quickly readjusting into a combat stance.

<b>

<b>

A shadow seemed to overflow from the forest path.

<b>

"Well, this is surprising. There's someone who can withstand this? I'm shocked."

<b>

The shadow spoke.

As the shadow began to take on a human form, the atmosphere of the battlefield changed dramatically.

The previously pungent smell of blood and flesh was replaced by a heavy, nauseating stench of decay, suffocating the air around them.

<b>

<b>

"Lawrence, don't rush ahead."

<b>

Another shadow took on a human form.

<b>

"That's right, Lawrence always jumps in first! It's unfair!"

<b>

Another shadow appeared.

<b>

"Because these dogs are on the verge of extinction! This layer here is surprisingly thick, isn't it?"

"Indeed, it seems like a good timing for our intervention."

"Still, who gets to make the first move is a different story, isn't it? Barney is too lenient with Lawrence."

<b>

<b>

With each new shadow, the malevolent aura thickened.

There were a total of five figures, all dressed similarly in butler attire, with silver hair.

They appeared as beautiful boys and girls, but their presence was toxic, like unclean entities.

<b>

The magical beast group had already been nearly annihilated.

The morale of the members had risen, showing signs of a victorious battle.

<b>

But the situation took a turn.

The low-ranked members were overwhelmed by the aura and could not move.

Even some mid-ranked members were lacking in vitality.

Though only a few remained, the surviving magical beasts had headed toward the village.

The high-ranked members heightened their vigilance, looking for openings in the movements.

<b>

"This is really annoying!"

<b>

The last to appear, a girl who looked like a silver-haired butler, brushed her long hair aside.

<b>

At that moment, a panicked shout came from above the watch.

<b>

"Not good! Get away from the 'Detection Plate'!!"

<b>

It seemed the member who had been monitoring from the watch had collapsed.

For now, it was confirmed that they had lost consciousness but were safe.

<b>

"Marcel. We no longer need detection. Send the low-ranked members to pursue the magical beasts."

<b>

At Howard's command, the low-ranked members began to gather and head toward the village, but...

<b>

"There's no way I'm letting them go."

<b>

The first shadow, called Lawrence, waved his hand.

Then, shadows at their feet writhed like snakes, quickly extending and piercing the shoulders and legs of the members trying to advance, causing them to collapse on the spot in agony.

<b>

"Well, they disappear quickly when exposed to sunlight."

<b>

The butler chuckled as he watched the fallen members, shrugging his shoulders.

<b>

"Lawrence, you know what to do, but don't let them die yet."

"I know, Ahab. I have a good sense of moderation."

<b>

"You bastards!!"

<b>

Howard glared at them, showing no sign of hiding his anger.

<b>

"Now, everyone, the prelude is over! From here on out, we will be your opponents!"

<b>

The butler called Lawrence spread his arms wide and declared theatrically to those present.

The five butlers lined up, and the shadows at their feet swayed like phantoms.

A wave of tension ran through the members. They gripped their weapons tightly and braced themselves.

<b>

<b>

But among them, one person stood still, glaring at the silver-haired Lawrence with an expression of fury.

It was Rider Haggard.

<b>

"You... I won't forget you... I won't forget you!!"

"What's wrong, Rider?"

<b>

As Howard kept his eyes on the butlers, he placed a hand on Rider's shoulder, asking.

<b>

"Chief... no, Cloud-san. It's him, no doubt about it! I won't forget him!!"

"Rider?"

"Ten years ago! It was him who held me down! This face, this voice! I won't forget!!!"

<b>

The scene from that time resurfaced in Rider's mind.

The emotions, the taste of blood in his mouth.

<b>

<b>

Amidst the thunder, the altar of the temple was destroyed, and the high priest was blown away, buried under rubble.

Many children fell victim right before his eyes, and the members who were supposed to protect them were all defeated.

He and Lavinia had also charged in anger but were easily subdued.

<b>

"You bastard! Let me go! Let me go, you beast!!!"

"Shut up, you'll be next, just wait patiently."

<b>

Rider's head was pressed further into the floor, making him taste the sand.

<b>

"Damn it! Lavinia! Lavinia!!"

"What? Are you that worried about that child? Then watch closely! It'll be over soon."

<b>

Rider was pinned down, unable to move, with his hair gripped, forcing him to look up.

A groan escaped his lips.

When he raised his head, there was Lavinia Cloud.

<b>

Lavinia appeared to be suspended in mid-air, her body arched back.

But an arm was thrust into her waist, supporting her weight.

Lavinia's body seemed to be held down by an invisible force, remaining completely motionless.

<b>

Blood dripped onto the floor, forming a pool.

Looking closely, Lavinia's right arm was twisted in an unnatural direction, hanging limply.

From there, bones seemed to be breaking through the skin, blood creating multiple lines down her arm, dripping down.

<b>

Despite such a severe injury, the strength in her eyes had not faded.

She looked at Rider with powerful eyes.

<b>

"Lavi... damn it! Lavi! Lavi!!"

"Rider..."

"Lavi! Damn it! I'm coming to save you! Wait for me, Lavi! Damn it! Let me go! Let me go, damn it!! Lavi—! Damn it—!!!"

<b>

The leg pressing down on Rider increased its strength, pushing him further into the floor.

<b>

"Haha! You're foolish to think you can be saved! Just watch closely!"

"Damn it! Damn it! Damn it—!!"

<b>

Tears welled up in Rider's eyes, distorting his vision.

Grinding his teeth, he pressed his face into the floor, shedding tears of frustration.

<b>

"Lavi... damn it..."

"Rider...!"

<b>

Hearing Lavinia's strong and warm voice, Rider instinctively turned his gaze toward her.

<b>

"Rider... please, please don't give up! Protect everyone... please! Rider... ahhh! Aaaahhh—!!"

<b>

The mastermind behind this tragedy sank its fangs into Lavinia's throat.

Her voice echoed, strained and lingering.

Eventually, that voice grew faint, her skin lost its color, turning pale like wax.

<b>

With a thud, Lavinia's body was thrown to the floor.

The one who had bitten her began to move its mouth, and soon, on its tongue, it placed a beautiful red gem the size of a pinky nail, as red as blood.

It picked it up with its fingers and peered at it as if to see it in the light.

<b>

"Incredible...! I've never seen such a beautiful star gem! So pure and clear... and the magical power is so high-quality and dense... perfect! I've never seen anything like this! Amazing! This village is the best! Hahaha! Ahahaha!!"

<b>

Orbet Mash. A true vampire who devours children to obtain star gems.

The mastermind behind this tragedy.

<b>

"Star gem," a mass of magical power and life force, sealing the brilliance of one's soul.

Orbet was now excitedly praising the finest item he had obtained.

<b>

"Congratulations! Lord Orbet."

"Thank you, Lawrence. Today is the best day ever."

<b>

As Lawrence congratulated him, Rider struggled on the floor.

<b>

"Uaaahhhhhhh! Lavi! Lavi! Lavi! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!!! You! You! You! You! You! I won't forgive you! I won't forgive you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Damn it! Damn it! Lavi! Lavi! Lavi—!!!"

<b>

Looking down at Rider, who continued to struggle on the floor, Orbet said...

<b>

"Oh? This one's boiling nicely too! Good! I can expect great things! Today is truly going to be the best day!"

<b>

Rider glared at Orbet, continuously pouring out his resentment.

He felt his head turning red with rage.

But that feeling was cut off when the wall behind Orbet suddenly burst open with a flash of white light.

<b>

The next time he regained consciousness was a week after the tragedy.

Lavinia was already gone, never to return.

<b>

Rider cried out before her gravestone...

Holding onto the last promise he made with her.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"What? Lawrence, do you know him?"

"Who knows? It was a long time ago, right? I don't remember that sort of thing. I don't know."

"That's true. It's rare to remember such things."

<b>

The silver butlers continued their lethargic conversation.

Rider's brow furrowed deeply, etched with intense lines.

His teeth were gritted so tightly that they seemed about to crack.

<b>

<b>

"Rider... could it be, could this guy be...?"

<b>

Just as Howard was about to ask Rider, the sound of bells rang out from within the village.

It wasn't the heavy sound of the alarm bells from the station but a clear, ringing sound.

However, despite the clear tone, the bells were being rung repeatedly with urgency, sounding as if there was no time to spare.

<b>

"This bell... could it be! The school?!"

<b>

Gary Meyers exclaimed in surprise.

<b>

"That's it... if they're after the children!!"

<b>

Howard glared at the butlers with a furious expression.

And at that moment, from deeper within, an even darker shadow began to seep out.

<b>

"Ah, what a perfect timing! Eliza and the others did a great job!"

<b>

The thick darkness took shape.

Colorless white hair.

Chilling cerulean blue eyes.

A black outer coat with a white shirt.

Around the chest, a noble-looking jabot with many pleats, at the center of which a gem of the same color as the eyes shone.

<b>

The moment it appeared, the malevolence in the area deepened and thickened, engulfing those present.

The low-ranked members had already lost their color and could not move. Even the mid-ranked members were sweating profusely.

<b>

Amidst this, only Rider shouted.

<b>

"You! It's you! I won't forget! I won't forget you!!"

<b>

Deepening his anger, he squeezed out his rage as if he were spitting blood from his gut.

Gripping his knight's sword tightly, he lowered his stance, ready to pounce.

<b>

"How rude of you to interrupt. Can I kill this one? Lord Orbet?"

<b>

The butler, taking the form of a girl with silver hair styled in a medium bob and a black ribbon, asked for permission with an annoyed expression.

<b>

"Well, wait a moment, Lawrence. But it's interesting that someone knows me?"

<b>

Orbet, touching the gem at his chest, looked at Rider with amusement.

<b>

"Ah, so it's you... so this is the one? Rider..."

<b>

Howard quietly asked Rider.

<b>

"Yes, Cloud-san! It's him! It's him! He took Lavinia from me!!!"

<b>

Rider replied, glaring at Orbet while answering Howard.

<b>

"Ku, I see, ku ku... ku, ku ku... so, finally, finally... ku ku ku."

<b>

<b>

"What? This old man suddenly starts laughing. It's creepy. Is this also your acquaintance?"

"I told you, I don't know!"

<b>

Lawrence, the butler, shot an annoyed glance at the butler named Lawrence.

<b>

"Marcel—!! Chant the battle song!! Raise the fighting spirit—!!!"

<b>

Howard thrust the Zweihänder into the ground with force and raised his voice.

<b>

<b>

"Ha, ha ha... ha ha ha! I've missed you! I've missed you, Child! Come at me without reservation! I will personally—!!! Now is the time! I will personally annihilate you!!!"

<b>

With his teeth bared, a fierce smile on his face, Howard Cloud roared.

<b>

----------------

The defense battle for the children.

Next time: "The Children of Amukam, Part 1"
