# 30 Episode Sonia Cloud's Tales from the Past

Mother! Father wants you to tell him the carriage is ready!"

What? You're early. I'm all packed up, but I'm still way ahead of schedule at ......."

I've been thinking about you," he said. "Father, you were kind of tense, so I went to ....... Even now, he's asking me if my mother is ready yet! He says to me, "Mother's not ready yet?

Well," he said, "I'm sorry. But, I'll ask you to wait a little. We need to get ready, don't we?"

"Mother? Didn't you say you just finished getting ready at ......?"

It's not mine. It's yours! Ravi!

<blank>

Me? I don't need to get ready, okay? It's your father and mother who are going out, remember?"

Oh, my God! Come on, come here! You're making such a mess of your hair ......, sit here while I comb it for you."

What?" This is after a workout, ......, and it's always ......, no problem. Unh! No problem!"

I'm sure you'll be seeing me in the temple after this! You're really going to ...... see all of us in the temple after this, aren't you? You'd better start dressing a little better, or your favorite lord will be disappointed."

I'm not there! There is no such thing!

<blank>

Oh? Is that so? I wonder if any of the kids are still coming to pick me up for the Harvest Festival?"

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know! I don't know!

'Well, ...... is that so? I thought the second son of the Haggard family was supposed to come and get you. ......"

Nah! Nah, why is the rider coming out there!"

<blank>

"Oh? You guys have been good friends since you were little."

"......, or was it ......, or was it ............?"

Yes - hold hands together wherever you go ......"

Was I right?

<blank>

'Hmmm... So? Ryder, aren't you coming to pick me up?"

La, the rider is ...... not him!"

What? What's wrong? What's wrong?"

Because he's just too good to give up!"

Oh my, ......."

Even in a hand-to-hand combat, if I roll the ball, he immediately says, "I'm defeated! I'm not going to let you go. At least be a little more persistent!"

Oh dear, well, as men, we must persevere and never give up. ......?"

Yes, it is! If you give up easily, ......, you're in trouble ...... and ....... And anyway! You'll have to learn to beat me first, rider!

<blank>

'Hmm, that's a lot of work, Ryder. ...... Yes, it's done. Hey Ravi? You always wear one pigtail, why not two? I think it's adorable."

'Thank you, Mother! Well, two is too childish! Besides, it's easier to move around with one. ...... But if you'll do it for me, Mother, I'll do it for you. ...... Oh! Oh, yes! Souvenir! A hair tie is good! I like ribbons or hair ties! Tie it at this part of the sash!

I'll go to Cecily's and see what I can find before I leave. I'll try to find a color that suits you.

Yes, I'm looking forward to it! I'm looking forward to it! Ah! Father wants to see you! Let's go, Mother.

"Hmm, I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Welcome aboard. Father! Mother!"

I'm off. Take care and don't get hurt."

Oh, God! Father! What are you worried about? It's your mother and father who are going out, it's the two of you who need to be careful.

'Mm, yeah, right. Mm."

Mooo!

I'm sure you'll be fine, Howard. Ravi is solid. Ravi, I'll be back before noon tomorrow. Take care of him, okay?"

I'll take care of it, Mother! Ah! That's right! I'll get lunch ready for you! Herb bird! What do you think?

Oh, that'll be fun! That's exciting! When did you learn to make them so perfectly?"

"Ugh ...... perfect for ...... eh ......"

If in doubt, ask Melbert.

'Wow, okay, I'll let the Long's aunt tell you about it. ...... And! Anyway! I'll take care of the house!"

I'm looking forward to the herb bird. I'm looking forward to the herb bird."

I'm off, Ravi. Be strong."

"Have a good day. Father! Mother! Take care!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

That was the last time I talked to Ravi. ......

<blank>

Sonia was speaking quietly, as if looking into the distance.

<blank>

'The next time I saw her, she was in bed. That night, I got word that the village had been attacked, and Howard rushed to ....... Several of the village's children were killed. Ravi fought to protect them and was unable to do so. ...... I was never told who attacked or how. But I was told that Ravi fought proudly to protect the children until the very end.

<blank>

Sonia's mouth was tightly knit and her hands were tightly clasped, shaking slightly.

<blank>

Sonia.

<blank>

Susie looked up at Sonia with concern, her hand clasped in hers.

<blank>

Sonia put one hand on Susie's head and gently stroked it, replying with her eyes, "Thank you.

<blank>

He didn't tell me what he had fought with, but I could imagine what he had seen in Ravi's condition. His skin had lost its blood and turned to wax. Two horrific scars on his throat. Vampire. A high ranking vampire. The Child Eater, an abominable vampire that only likes to attack children. Perhaps that's the one that attacked this village and stole ...... Lavi!

<blank>

Sonia told him the name of the person he should hate, as if spitting it out.

<blank>

Ms. Sonia...

Three days later. Three days later, the light of Ravi's life, which had barely held him together, was extinguished. Even with the help of Temple Chief Henry, who had just arrived in the village at that time, the physical wounds could be healed, but the fountain of life that had been lost could not be ...... restored."

<blank>

Sonia said quietly, then looked up to the heavens and meditated.

Several drops spill from the corners of his eyes.

<blank>

Sonia... Sonia! I'm sorry! I didn't want to make you talk about such a painful thing! I didn't want to remind you! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

If we see her and she reminds us of Ravi,...... and gives us a hard time, then I'll go where I can't be seen. She is a ...... girl who thinks that way."

Oh no, you're just a 13 year old kid."

'Hmmm, yes, he's still a kid on the outside. But I told you. That boy is intelligent and thoughtful. Will. He's got a much calmer mind than most kids. He says he wishes I was a little more firm.

<blank>

'Oh, really? Uncle ...... sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it?"

'Hmmm, I'm having fun. I'm glad I'm having fun. The light of this house that had been extinguished was lit again when that child came. That's why we don't want to lose her. That's why we hesitated to talk about Ravi.

"............"

I don't think we can remain undisturbed when we talk about Ravi," he said. What would Suzy think when she saw that? If my presence reminds her of Ravi and brings back painful memories for us ......, she will try to keep her image away from us, won't she? That's what I and Sonia thought."

".................."

It's something we'll have to talk about at some point," he said. This is just a postponement of the problem. We know that. We know, but we didn't have the courage. We can't stand the thought of losing her again ......."

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

I'm sorry, Sonia, if my fault makes you cry, if it makes you bitter! I can't stay here! I can't stay in this house! I'm sorry!

Susie! Please! Don't say that! Please, Suzy! Calm down! Please!

<blank>

When Suzy complained with tears welling up in her eyes, Sonia hugged her with all her might and tried to calm her down.

And whisper softly.

<blank>

"Susie, listen to me. I'm so glad you came. Your hair and mannerisms remind me of Ravi's for some reason. Your hair and mannerisms remind me of Ravi's for some reason ......, but you know, I enjoyed combing your hair."

Sonia?

<blank>

I was so happy that you enjoyed the food so much. It is so much fun for us to pick out clothes together and match the outfits. I am very happy to cook and do needlework with you every day.

"...so...soni...a-san?"

Howard told me about your background the night you returned from the temple. You had no parents, were raised by your grandfather, and were already living on your own. You had been raised by your grandfather and were already living on your own, and then you came to a world you didn't know.

!

<blank>

She has no parents, and I don't know if she will ever be able to go home. Such a child is in front of me now, all alone. I thought to myself, "I want to be with her. I wanted to be with her. I want to be her family.

<blank>

Sonia's arms around Suzy are tightening.

<blank>

..."

<blank>

Sonia continues to speak softly with Suzy in her arms.

<blank>

'Yes, we want to be a family. Ravi is gone ...... and I can't change that. It still crushes me when I remember it. But that doesn't mean it's harder because you're here. It's because you're here. It is because you are family. You are our new daughter, just like Ravi. ......

Family? ...the same as ... as ... as ... as Mr. Ravi's? Ravi's... me... daughter?

Yes. "Yes. ...... Yes! Yes! Ravi is your sister! You are Ravi's sister! You are our family!

"Sister? ...family... my..."

<blank>

<blank>

Suzy's story of being raised by her grandfather without parents is a story in a game.

It is a role-play that consists of your own characters within the same account and is set up as a family.

However, the Reisai apparatus recognized it as a fact.

<blank>

<blank>

And in fact, his real-life environment was similar.

His parents separated soon after he was born, and his mother raised him as a single mother.

His mother worked day and night, so he does not remember eating much of her cooking.

<blank>

In effect, it was his grandparents who took care of him.

Before he went to high school, his mother remarried, and his new father invited him to come live with them.

However, the year before, his grandmother had passed away, and he found it difficult to leave his grandfather, who would be left alone. He chose to live with his grandfather, wanting his two parents to spend their new life together.

<blank>

His grandfather also passed away while still in college.

He was invited by his parents to stay with them this time at his grandfather's funeral, but he thought it would be wrong for a man over 20 years old to be spoiled by his parents. He continued to live alone until he was 32 years old.

<blank>

He has not seen his mother for more than 10 years, but she seems to be as healthy as ever.

<blank>

I never thought I was particularly unhappy or in a unique environment.

Because that was the norm.

My grandparents were kind, but I never really understood what people called family.

<blank>

The reason I don't feel the urge to return to my original world may be due to the fact that I don't have a family.

<blank>

<blank>

But now, when Sonia threw the word "family" at her, Susie felt herself being shaken.

<blank>

The memory of not having that family is not of this world.

It is not of this body, nor of this mind.

It is just a 'memory' that has nothing to do with this world.

<blank>

And this "body" is not of this world either.

The original would have been nothing more than data from the game world.

But it has flesh, and it has become a thing that exists in reality.

<blank>

Where does this body belong?

That's what I can't figure out.

<blank>

I have had this question since the day I realized that this was not a dream. I have had this question since the day I realized that this was not a dream.

<blank>

It grew the more I liked the people of the Cloud family, the more I became friends with the children of the village, and the more I fell in love with this village.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

---But Sonia says I'm family...

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Family? Sonia, Howard and family?"

You are my second daughter. You are my second daughter. So, we will always be together! Shall we live together?"

Family, daughter, Sonia's ... in this house ... together?

"Yes, we'll be together in this house. This is your home."

"Can I stay in my house? Can I stay here?

Of course. We are family, okay? This is your home. This is your home. Of course you can stay.

My home. A home to come home to. Home to stay... home.

<blank>

Susie said the words over and over again, as if she were checking each word.

Sonia patiently repeats the affirmation over and over again as if to build on the words.

<blank>

Sonia felt the strength leave Suzy's stiffened body.

Susie puts her hands around Sonia's body, clings to her and leans her body against it, and then buries her face in it as well.

<blank>

My home... where I belong.

<blank>

Sonia gently pats Suzy on the back and speaks quietly to her, as if she is gently soothing a young child in her arms.

<blank>

It's okay to stay here. This is your home. Wherever you are, from wherever you are, you can come back here.

I... my...

<blank>

Suzy buries her face further and shivers a little.

<blank>

Sonia gently pats Susie's head.

The head of that child who sobs and cries with a muffled voice, just gently and forever and ever.
