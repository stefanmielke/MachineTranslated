# Episode 30: Sonia Cloud's Tale of Old

"Mother! Father is calling, saying the carriage is ready!"

"Oh? That was quick, wasn't it? I'm all set, but... it's still quite early compared to the scheduled time."

"Father seemed really eager... Even now, he keeps asking me if you're ready!"

"Well then. Shall we make him wait a little longer? We need to finish our preparations too, right?"

"Mother? Didn't you just say you were ready?"

"Not me. You! Ravy!"

<b>

"Me? I don't need to get ready! It's Father and Mother who are going out!"

"Come on! Just come here! Your hair is such a mess... I'll help you fix it, so sit down here."

"Eh? Th-this is after training... It's always like this... It's fine. Yup! It's fine!"

"Just sit down! Honestly... You're going to meet everyone at the temple later, right? If you don't pay a little attention to your appearance, your favorite gentleman will be disappointed!"

"N-no! There's no one like that!!"

<b>

"Oh? Is that so? Is there no one coming to pick you up for the harvest festival?"

"Th-th-that's not it... There are circumstances on their side... I don't know! I don't know!!"

"Well... is that so? I thought for sure that the second son of the Haggard family would come to pick you up..."

"W-w-w-why are we talking about Ryder here?!"

<b>

"Oh? But you two have been close friends since you were little, haven't you?"

"…Is that so…?"

"Yes, you used to hold hands wherever you went..."

"Did we?!"

<b>

"Hehehe, so? Is Ryder not coming to pick you up?"

"R-Ryder is... not an option!"

"Oh? Why not? Did something happen?"

"Because he gives up way too easily!"

"Oh dear..."

"When we spar, as soon as I throw him, he says 'I give up!'? At least try to hold on a little longer!"

"Oh dear, yes, boys should persist and challenge without giving up... right?"

"Y-yes! If he gives up so easily... it would be a problem... So, anyway! Ryder needs to win against me first before we talk about anything else!!"

<b>

"Hehe, that sounds tough for Ryder... Alright, it's done. Hey Ravy? You always have one braid, but why not two? I think it would look cute!"

"Thank you, Mother! Well, two braids look childish! Plus, one is easier to move with... But if you do it for me... Oh! That's right! Souvenirs! Hair accessories would be great! A ribbon or hair tie would be nice! To tie this part of the braid!"

"Alright, then let's see if we can find something suitable at Cecily's shop before we head back. I'll look for a color that suits you."

"Yay! I'm looking forward to it! Oh! Father is calling! Let's go, Mother!"

"Hehe, I guess we've kept them waiting too long."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Take care. Father! Mother!"

"Yes, I'm off. Be careful not to get hurt."

"Honestly! Father! What are you worrying about?! It's you and Mother who are going out, so you should be the ones being careful?!"

"Ah, yes, that's right. Hmm."

"Geez!"

"Hehe, it's alright Howard. Ravy is very reliable. Ravy, you'll be back before noon tomorrow, right? Please take care of the house while we're gone?"

"Leave it to me, Mother! Oh! That's right! I'll prepare lunch! Herb chicken! How about that?!"

"Oh! I'm looking forward to it! When did you become able to make it perfectly?"

"Uh... Perfectly... well... um..."

"Hehehe, if you're unsure, just ask Aunt Melvale."

"I-I understand, I'll ask Aunt Long... So! Anyway! Leave the house to me!!"

"Ah, thank you, Ravy. I'm looking forward to the herb chicken."

"Off I go, Ravy. Be good."

"Take care! Father! Mother! Be safe!!"

<b>

<b>

<b>

"That was the last time I spoke with Ravy..."

<b>

Sonia spoke quietly, as if looking far away.

<b>

"The next time I saw her, she was in bed. That night, I received news that the village had been attacked, and Howard rushed there... Many of the village children fell victim. Ravy fought to protect them but was unable to... I was never told who attacked or how. But I heard that Ravy fought proudly until the end to protect the children."

<b>

Sonia's lips were tightly pressed together, and her hands were clenched tightly, trembling slightly.

<b>

"...Sonia-san."

<b>

Suzie, placing her hand over Sonia's, looked up at her with concern.

<b>

Sonia gently placed one hand on Suzie's head, responding with a silent thank you.

<b>

"I wasn't told what she fought against, but seeing Ravy's condition, I could imagine. Her skin was waxen, drained of color. Two dreadful wounds remained on her throat. A vampire. A high-ranking one. The abominable vampire 'Child Eater' that prefers to prey on children. That must have attacked this village... and taken Ravy away!"

<b>

Sonia spat out the name of the loathsome enemy.

<b>

"Sonia-san..."

"Three days later, the flicker of Ravy's life, which had barely been held onto, was extinguished. Even with the power of the newly arrived High Priest Henry, who had just come to this village, he could heal the physical wounds, but he could not restore the wellspring of lost life..."

<b>

Sonia said this quietly, looking up at the sky with closed eyes.

Tears streamed down from the corners of her eyes.

<b>

"Sonia-san... Sonia-san! I'm sorry! I didn't want to make you talk about such painful things! I didn't want to remind you! I'm sorry! So! So... I!!"

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

"If we see that child and remember Ravy... if it causes us pain, then I will go somewhere out of sight. ...That's how that child thinks."

"That's still a child of only 13 years old, isn't it?"

"Hehe, yes, they still look like a child. But I told you, didn't I? That child is wise and thoughtful. Will. That child has a far more composed mindset than the other children around. I think I should be more reliable in their eyes too."

<b>

"Is that so? Uncle... you seem to be having fun?"

"Hehehe, it's fun. I'm happy. That child came, and the light that had vanished from this house has been rekindled. That's why we don't want to lose that child. That's why we hesitated to talk about Ravy."

"…………"

"If we talk about Ravy, we cannot remain calm even now. What would Suzie think if she saw that? If her existence reminds us of Ravy and brings back painful memories... wouldn't she try to distance herself from us? That's what Sonia and I thought."

"………………"

"One day, we will have to talk about it. It's just postponing the problem. I understand that. I know, but we didn't have the courage to do it. We can't bear to lose that child again..."

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

"If my presence makes Sonia-san cry, if it makes her sad, I'm sorry! I shouldn't be here! I shouldn't be in this house! I'm sorry!"

"Suzie! Please! Don't say that! Please, Suzie! Calm down! Please!!"

<b>

Sonia tried to calm Suzie, who was overflowing with tears, by holding her tightly.

And she whispered gently.

<b>

"Suzie, listen? I was happy you came. Your hair and demeanor somehow remind me of Ravy... But you know, I enjoyed combing your hair."

"...Sonia-san?"

<b>

"I was really happy to see you eat delicious food. Choosing clothes together and matching outfits is so much fun. Every day, cooking and sewing with you makes me very happy."

"...S-Sonia, san?"

"On the night you returned from the temple, Howard told me about your situation. You have no parents, raised by your grandfather, and you were already living independently. Then you ended up in this unknown world."

"!!?"

<b>

"You have no parents, and you don't know if you can go back. That child is here all alone in front of me. I thought, I want to be with this child. I want to be her family."

<b>

Sonia tightened her embrace around Suzie.

<b>

"…"

<b>

Sonia continued to speak gently while holding Suzie.

<b>

"Yes, I want to be family. Ravy is no longer here... that cannot be changed. Even now, remembering it crushes my heart. But that doesn't mean your presence makes it painful, you know? Rather, your presence eases that pain. Because you are family. Another new daughter of ours, just like Ravy..."

"...Family? ...Like Ravy-san? ...I am... the same... daughter of Ravy-san?"

"Yes... that's right! Yes! Ravy is your older sister! You are Ravy's younger sister! You are our family!"

"Younger sister? ...Family... my..."

<b>

<b>

Suzie's story of being raised by her grandfather without parents was a tale from within the game.

It was a roleplay set up with characters from the same account, creating a family setting.

However, the spirit-sensing device recognized it as fact.

<b>

<b>

And in reality, his environment was somewhat similar.

His parents separated shortly after he was born, and his mother raised him as a single mother.

Since his mother worked day and night, he hardly remembered eating her home-cooked meals.

<b>

In essence, it was his grandparents who took care of him.

Before he entered high school, his mother remarried, and at that time, she invited him to live with them.

However, thinking of his grandfather, who had lost his grandmother the previous year and was now alone, he found it hard to leave, wanting his parents to start their new life together, so he chose to live with his grandfather.

<b>

That grandfather also passed away while he was in college.

At the funeral, his parents invited him again to come live with them, but he thought it would be inappropriate for a man over twenty to rely on his parents. So, he continued living alone until now at the age of 32.

<b>

He hadn't seen his mother in over ten years, but she seemed to be doing well.

<b>

He never thought of himself as unhappy or in a special environment.

It was just the way things were.

His grandparents were kind, but the concept of family as society defined it never quite resonated with him.

<b>

Coming to this world, his lack of desire to return to his original world might also stem from the absence of family.

<b>

<b>

But now, as Suzie was confronted with the word family from Sonia, she felt her heart wavering.

<b>

The memories of not having a family were not from this world.

They did not belong to this body or this heart.

They were merely 'memories' that had no connection to this world.

<b>

And this 'body' was not of this world either.

It had originally been nothing more than data from the game world.

Yet, it had taken on flesh and existed in reality.

<b>

To which belonging does this flesh belong?

That was something she did not understand.

<b>

Did she have the right to be here? This question had been on her mind since the day she realized this was not a dream.

<b>

It had grown larger as she grew to like the people of the Cloud family and became closer to the village children.

<b>

<b>

<b>

---But Sonia-san says I am family---

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Family? ...Sonia-san, with Howard-san, family?"

"Yes, family. You are my second daughter. So, we'll always be together! Let's live together, okay?"

"Family, daughter, Sonia-san's... in this house... together?"

"Yes, together in this house? This is your home."

"My home... Is it okay for me to stay? Is it alright for me to be here?"

"Of course. We are family, right? This is your home. This is the place you can always come back to. It's definitely okay for you to be here."

"My home. The place I can return to. It's okay... to be home."

<b>

Suzie repeated each word as if confirming them.

Sonia patiently affirmed those words over and over.

<b>

Sonia felt the tension leave Suzie's body.

Suzie wrapped her arms around Sonia, clinging to her and burying her face in her.

<b>

"My place to return... it's okay, the place..."

<b>

Sonia gently patted Suzie's back as if soothing a young child, quietly speaking to her.

<b>

"It's okay to be here. This is your home. No matter where you are, from anywhere, you can always come back here."

"I... my..."

<b>

Suzie buried her face deeper and trembled slightly.

<b>

Sonia gently stroked Suzie's head.

She continued to tenderly caress the head of the child who was sobbing quietly, suppressing her voice.
