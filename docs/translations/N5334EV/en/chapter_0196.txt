# Chapter 184: The Downfall of Lawrence Niven

"Are you aware that a criminal organization was recently dismantled?"

<b>

Philip quietly interjects, cutting off Lawrence's explanation.

<b>

"It would be more accurate to say it was annihilated rather than dismantled... It's absurd to think it happened 'just by chance.'"

<b>

"...What do you mean? What are you talking about?"

<b>

Lawrence furrows his brow at Philip's words, which are tinged with a wry smile.

<b>

"Roderick McGavin will arrive at the East Gate shortly, in less than an hour. He is said to have captured the leader of the bandits and is bringing him in."

<b>

After Lawrence, Dalton Banjo called out.

Startled, Lawrence turned around, replaying the meaning of those words in his mind.

<b>

--- McGavin is safe? He captured the leader? Goul?! Ridiculous!

His stronghold couldn't be taken down by even a single squad of knights.

But there had been no information about such forces being mobilized!

Is it a bluff?!

<b>

"What does that have to do with me?"

<b>

"Mr. McGavin reportedly seized a large amount of evidence of crimes at the bandits' stronghold."

<b>

Bona Raven Casper continued alongside Dalton.

<b>

"So what?! I have nothing to do with that!"

<b>

"It seems that the leader of the bandit group, which has numerous monsters, is suggesting a connection to you."

<b>

"What?! Sir Codeweiner?! That's fabricated! This is a conspiracy to slander me!!"

<b>

Furthermore, Codeweiner Lineburger, the head of the information bureau, aligned himself with Bona.

Codeweiner's usually soft gaze was replaced with a cold light in his eyes.

<b>

Lawrence gasped momentarily at the unexpected words from an unexpected opponent, but quickly dismissed it as a conspiracy.

<b>

"Lawrence Niven. The Temple Bureau has decided to subject you to a spiritual inquiry."

<b>

"Even Lord Goldberg?! This... this is nonsense!!"

<b>

Lawrence's feet involuntarily retreated at Robert Landel Goldberg's words, which felt like a follow-up.

<b>

--- What on earth is going on?!

The Fluke has collapsed, but I have erased anything that could connect directly to me. There shouldn't be any conclusive evidence.

Could it be that Goul was really captured? No! That is simply impossible!

There is no way that any force could manage that in just a few days!

There shouldn't be any situation where I am cornered like this!

What on earth happened?! ---

<b>

Unpleasant sweat began to bead on his forehead.

His hand pressed against his chest tightened, crumpling the shirt he held.

<b>

"An inquiry?! If you just investigate, you'll see immediately that I have nothing to do with any of this! I have no connection to that criminal organization whatsoever!!"

<b>

--- But at worst, even if I am detained here, I have connections in the upper echelons of the guards. Also within the administration.

Even if some evidence were to emerge, I have already arranged to eliminate it in advance.

It's the same as always; there's no need to panic.

I was surprised that the top two, Lineburger and Goldberg, intervened, but there won't be any evidence that connects to me.

If no evidence emerges, I can create a favor with these two.

And I can let Cloud, Banjo, and Casper take the responsibility for it ---

<b>

<b>

"If you were thinking of having the senior guards or the Dekkenbel officials do something, they have already been dismissed."

<b>

"Huh? W-What?!"

<b>

Codeweiner Lineburger looked up at the sky and sighed heavily as he continued.

<b>

"Honestly, as of now, two senior squad leaders and three officials from the bureau have been dismissed. And more are coming out in a chain reaction. Now I have to fill those gaps. I wonder how much strain this will put on the related parties... It's truly a headache."

<b>

"W-What are you talking about...?"

<b>

"Lord Lineburger has stated that you no longer have any forces left."

<b>

"F-Foolishness!!"

<b>

Lawrence shouted at Dalton's words.

Out of the corner of his eye, Lawrence caught sight of the guards by the entrance door approaching him.

<b>

"You are also suspected of treason. I advise you to submit to the inquiry and prove your innocence."

<b>

"N-No, that's... that's absurd!"

<b>

Lawrence's complexion drained at Goldberg's words.

Whether it was possible or not, he realized that his escape route had been cut off.

An intense feeling of anxiety, unlike anything he had ever experienced, began to seep into him from the ground up.

<b>

<b>

<b>

At that moment, the floor was jolted by a heavy vibration.

A delayed explosion sound resonated from outside, causing the glass doors facing outside to rattle violently.

Many people in the hall instinctively crouched down, and small screams erupted from the women.

<b>

"Where did that come from?!"

<b>

Philip stood protectively in front of Annie and shouted for the guards to check the explosion site.

<b>

<b>

Feeling the eyes around him divert from himself, Lawrence slid his hand from his chest into the depths of his coat.

He quickly pulled something out from within.

What fit in his hand was something resembling a pocket watch.

<b>

<b>

Karen was watching Lawrence's movements from the stage.

<b>

The object in Lawrence's hand was slightly larger than a pocket watch.

A protrusion resembling a lever jutted out from the part that would touch the base of his thumb.

Something like a winding crown extended from between his middle and ring fingers.

It was a bit large for a crown.

It also looked like some sort of tube.

<b>

That was something dangerous, Karen's instincts warned strongly.

<b>

The arm that was about to commit that heinous act was aimed at Dalton, Bona, and Cordelia.

<b>

In an instant, Karen's feet were enveloped in red light. At the same time, her body moved.

Without any room for linguistic thought, her body reacted instantaneously.

<b>

To Karen's left, Lawrence thrust out his right hand.

Lawrence's open body was in front of Karen.

Sliding down from the stage, Karen swiftly reached Lawrence in the blink of an eye, tracing a low red arc.

<b>

And the moment Lawrence clenched the lever in his palm, she kicked his right hand upward with all her might from below.

<b>

Red magical light burst around, and Lawrence's wrist was shattered as it was thrust upward.

<b>

Lawrence's agonized voice echoed around, and simultaneously, the gadget in his hand drew a magic circle in the air to indicate activation.

<b>

『Palm-sized Magic Device』

It was a small magical manifestation device filled with an extremely small magical accumulation container.

<b>

The magic that had been loaded above the palm-sized magic device manifested.

With a small explosion near the ceiling, a thin mist spread.

<b>

The mist touched the white plastered ceiling, and the golden chains suspending the chandelier began to change color and warp before their eyes.

<b>

"'Corrosive Mist'? What the hell?!"

<b>

Philip shouted upon witnessing it.

<b>

It was a magic that manifested at a point and spread over a small area.

If it were outdoors, it would be a low-level magic with little effect due to air movement.

However, if it manifested indoors, in a sealed space, it was a different story.

That strong acid, which could corrode gold immediately, would rot human skin on contact, blind the eyes, and burn the lungs if inhaled.

Lawrence had used it indoors, among a crowd of people.

<b>

As Lawrence groaned and tried to escape the scene, Bona twisted his arm and pressed him to the floor.

The gadget rolled out of Lawrence's hand.

Karen instinctively pulled Cordelia close, wrapping her arms around her back.

<b>

『Air Wall!』

Dalton created a wall of wind directed at the ceiling.

It spread thinly and widely across the ceiling, creating a gentle airflow that began to gather the corrosive mist.

<b>

"Open the glass doors!"

<b>

At Dalton's shout, the servants by the windows hurriedly opened the large glass doors that reached the ceiling one after another.

<b>

『Water Droplet Creation』

Dalton cast another spell to match the air wall.

<b>

He gathered the dispersing corrosive mist and created countless small water droplets to mix in.

Once it was condensed to the size of a basketball, the servants released it out through the windows they had opened.

<b>

"You’re still as skillful as ever."

<b>

"And you’re still as efficient as ever."

<b>

Bona spoke to Dalton, who had skillfully pushed the corrosive mist outside.

Dalton replied to Bona, who had efficiently pinned down Lawrence.

<b>

<b>

"…D-Don't think you can get away with this to me!"

<b>

Lawrence, handed over to the approaching guards, shouted at Bona and Dalton.

<b>

"Don't you dare joke around, Karen! What do you think you're doing to me, someone who has done you favors?! After all I've done for you, you treat me like this! You ingrate!!"

<b>

While grimacing in pain from his shattered wrist, Lawrence yelled at Karen.

Karen gasped at Lawrence's outburst, freezing momentarily.

But remembering what this man had done, she felt she had no obligation to listen to him. Her hand trembled unconsciously.

<b>

"You're the one who's joking around!!"

<b>

Before Karen could speak, Cordelia burst out from her arms.

<b>

"What you did was simply take something precious from Karen! What you gave her was nothing but sadness and pain! You, who call Karen an ingrate, are undoubtedly the shameful one!!"

<b>

<b>

"You little girl! Don’t speak as if you know everything!!"

<b>

Lawrence spat out words filled with hatred towards Cordelia.

This time, Karen shielded Cordelia, hiding her behind her shoulder.

<b>

"Uncle Niven... no, Mr. Niven. I will never forget what you did. And I will not allow you to hurt anyone close to me any longer."

<b>

"What will you do if you don’t forgive me?! What can a powerless little girl like you do?!! All you can do is cry, kneel, and beg for my forgiveness!!"

<b>

"Y-You...!"

<b>

"That's enough, Cordelia."

<b>

Bona stepped in front of Cordelia and Karen, as if to say that they no longer needed to see this filth.

<b>

"Take him away!"

<b>

From the stage, Philip called out to the two guards who were restraining Lawrence to take him away.

As the two guards responded to the call and tried to drag Lawrence, who continued to curse and resist...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

--- A gust of wind blew into the room.

<b>

<b>

Many people shielded their eyes from the wind.

The opened glass doors shook violently, making a loud noise.

<b>

And a low male scream echoed through the hall.

The two guards who had secured Lawrence were rolling on the floor, crying out in pain.

Those two guards had lost both arms above the elbows.

<b>

Lawrence sat on the spot, still holding onto the guards' hands.

<b>

And standing beside him, as if he had appeared out of nowhere, was a slender man.

<b>

"Van... brother?"

<b>

Silver hair, free of any peculiarities, spilled over his face.

Van Niven. Karen cast a wary glance at the man who had suddenly appeared.

<b>

"Hmm, have you regained your memory in such a short time? ...I see, you set up a farce to unlock the lid on your memory by yourself... Indeed, if forced open from the outside, it wouldn't be surprising if some distortion appeared in your mind."

<b>

Van noticed Karen's gaze and looked back at her with narrowed eyes, as if to say he found it interesting.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"That's why I said I wouldn't let you escape!!"

<b>

Another person jumped into the scene.

From the garden side, where the glass doors were opened, someone rushed into the room, pointing the tip of a two-handed sword at Van and shouting energetically.

<b>

"Calm down, Arvin! This guy is not to be underestimated!"

<b>

Another person followed, clinging to Arvin and opening their arms to block his path.

<b>

"Arvin?! Brother!"

<b>

Annie, sheltered by Philip, shouted as she recognized Arvin and Will on the stage.

<b>

"I completely agree that we shouldn't let him escape!"

<b>

With a loud clap of his gauntlets, a figure with a mischievous smile followed behind.

<b>

"Senior Alicia!"

<b>

Karen called out upon seeing her.

Noticing Karen, Alicia tossed her ponytail and winked at her with a grin.

For some reason, Cordelia's grip on Karen's arm tightened.

<b>

<b>

Van brushed off the guards' hands still attached to Lawrence's arms and placed his right hand on Lawrence's back to support him, helping him to stand.

<b>

"Van! Do something about this situation! At the very least, take that girl's stone! The gem that will be the key to the hidden temple! And somehow return to Grusmil and regroup! We still have supplies and troops..."

<b>

"Father, that is a futile struggle."

<b>

"What?!"

<b>

"You no longer have any forces. That foolish flesh-eater has made a blunder. Moreover, that is something beyond your control."

<b>

"What do you mean?! What on earth is going on?!!"

<b>

"Your role has come to an end, Father."

<b>

"!!...W-What? What are you...?"

<b>

In the next moment, several thin spear-like objects shot out from Lawrence's chest as if they had suddenly sprouted from there.

Lawrence looked down at them in disbelief, questioning Van, who stood behind him.

<b>

"You once cursed the misery of being exploited, gained power, and turned from being acted upon to acting. You wielded power as a predator, growing more and more greedy for strength and abundance."

<b>

Without answering that monologue, the blood drained from Lawrence's face as he weakly knelt at Van's feet.

With a slick motion, Van's fingers were withdrawn from Lawrence's back. Lawrence's body thudded to the floor.

Van's fingertips were long and sharp like daggers, stained with Lawrence's blood.

<b>

"It’s just that the roles have simply reversed. It’s something that happens often in this world."

<b>

Van flicked his fingers as if to shake off the filth from his fingertips.

With a sound like the wind cutting through, droplets of blood splattered onto the floor.

<b>

"That person has said that you are no longer needed."

<b>

Van Niven's mouth twisted into a cruel smile.

His thin, sharp eyes glimmered with a coal-like red hue.
