# 184 The Ruin of Lawrence Niven

Did you know that one criminal organization was recently dismantled?"

<blank>

As if interrupting Lawrence's defense, Philip quietly drops his words.

<blank>

"It's more accurate to say that it was annihilated than dismantled in effect. ...... It's appalling that they say it 'just happened'."

<blank>

"...... what? What are you talking about?"

<blank>

Lawrence raises his eyebrows at Philip's wry smile.

<blank>

Mr. Roderick McGovern will be arriving at the east gate in less than an hour. He has captured the bandit leader and is bringing him in.

<blank>

After Lawrence, Dalton Banjo called out to him.

Lawrence turns around in surprise and ruminates on the meaning of those words in his mind.

<blank>

--McGovern is safe? You think McGovern's okay? Gohl? That's ridiculous!

His stronghold is not something that can be dropped without a squadron of knights.

But there was no information that such forces had moved!

Is he bluffing?

<blank>

What does that have to do with me?"

<blank>

McGovern said he seized a large amount of evidence of the crime at the bandit's stronghold.

<blank>

Bona Raven Casper continues her words alongside Dalton.

<blank>

'So what's the matter? I say I had nothing to do with it!"

<blank>

The head of the bandit group, who has a number of demons in his ranks, suggests a relationship with you.

<blank>

What? Sir Leinberger? That's exactly what it is, a fabrication! It's a conspiracy to undermine me!

<blank>

In addition, Cordwainer Reinberger, head of the Intelligence Directorate, will line up with Bona.

Cordwainer's soft gaze, which he usually shows, was hidden, and a cold light dwelled in his eyes.

<blank>

Lawrence gulps for a moment at the unexpected words from the other party, but then he quickly accuses it of being a conspiracy.

<blank>

Lawrence Niven. The Temple Authority has decided to bring you in for a Spiritual Examination."

<blank>

'Even Lord Goldberg? Such ...... such nonsense!"

<blank>

Lawrence's feet drop unknowingly as Robert Randall Goldberg follows up.

<blank>

--What the heck does this mean?

Fluke was crushed, but anything directly connected to him was erased. There is no way anything definitive will come out.

Did they really catch Gohl? Nope! That's just not possible!

There is no way that we will have the strength to deal with that thing in just a few days!

There was no way they could have been driven to this point!

What the hell happened? --

<blank>

Disgusting perspiration comes gushing out.

The hand on Lawrence's chest tightens, and the shirt in his grasp begins to wrinkle in a big way.

<blank>

Inquiry? You don't have to do that, you can find out right away! I have nothing to do with them! I have nothing to do with those criminal organizations!

<blank>

-But worst case scenario, even if he is taken into custody here, he has contacts in the upper echelons of the Guard. Even within the administration.

Even in the unlikely event that some kind of physical evidence is found, arrangements are in place to destroy it in advance.

Same as always, no need to panic.

I was surprised that the two-tops, Rheinberger and Goldberg, interrupted me, but there was no evidence that would lead back to me.

If no evidence is produced, we will be able to make a debt to these two gentlemen.

And let Cloud, Banjo, and Casper take the blame for that.

<blank>

<blank>

If they were thinking of letting the senior guards or the officials of the DeKembel government offices do something about it, they've already been removed from office."

<blank>

What? What?

<blank>

Cordwainer Leinberger looks up to the heavens and continues with a grand sigh.

<blank>

I've got two senior company commanders and three government department heads, I think. And from there, it's just starting to trickle out. Now we have to fill in the gaps. I wonder how many wrinkles are going to fall on all the parties concerned. It's a real headache from now on. ......

<blank>

Hey, what are you saying ......?"

<blank>

Lord Rheinberger has told me that there is nothing left for you to fight for."

<blank>

Huh." Screw you!"

<blank>

Dalton's words elicited a shout from Lawrence.

Out of the corner of his eye, Lawrence saw the guards by the entrance door coming toward him.

<blank>

You are also suspected of treason. I recommend that you go through the hearing and prove your innocence.

<blank>

Oh, no, ...... that's ridiculous!"

<blank>

Lawrence's color fades at Goldberg's words.

I realized that my way out was now cut off, whether it was possible or not.

A sense of urgency, never before experienced, invades the body from the feet up.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, the floor was thrust up into a heavy vibration.

A little later, a popping sound echoes from the outdoors, echoing in the underbelly, and the glass door facing outside rattles violently with vibration.

Many in the hall bent down as quickly as they could, and small screams rose one after another from the women.

<blank>

From where?

<blank>

Philip stood to protect Annie and shouted to the guards to check the location of the explosion.

<blank>

<blank>

Sensing that the eyes around him had turned away from him, Lawrence slid his hand, which had been resting on his chest, deeper into his jacket.

Quickly take something out from behind it.

It fits in your hand like a pocket watch.

<blank>

<blank>

Karen followed Lawrence's behavior with her eyes from the podium.

<blank>

The object in Lawrence's hand is a bit large for a pocket watch.

A protrusion resembling a lever protrudes from the body at the base of the thumb.

An object like the crown of a watch extended from between the middle and ring fingers of the grip.

A little big for a crown.

It appears to be a tube of some kind.

<blank>

A strong warning rings in Karen's mind that that was something dangerous.

<blank>

The arm that is about to do the deed is facing Dalton, Bona, and Cordilia. And Cordelia.

<blank>

A moment later, Karen's feet are covered with red light. At the same time, her body moves.

There was no room for linguistic thought, and the body reacted instantaneously.

<blank>

To the left, as seen from Karen, Lawrence held out his own right hand.

Lawrence's open body is in front of Karen.

Karen moved herself as if gliding from the platform, and in a blink of an eye, she had reached Lawrence's proximity in a low red trajectory.

<blank>

Then, the moment Lawrence grips the lever in his palm, he kicks his right hand as hard as he can from below.

<blank>

Red magical light flashed around the area, and Lawrence's wrist leapt upward, shattering.

<blank>

Lawrence's anguished voice echoes around the area, and at the same time, the gadget in his hand draws a magic circle in space to indicate its activation.

<blank>

"The Magic Hand"

It is a small magic manifestation device loaded with an extremely small magic storage casing.

<blank>

The magic loaded in the palm of the hand is manifested above where the magic device is pointed.

A thin haze spread with a small burst of sound that occurred near the ceiling.

<blank>

The white plastered ceiling that the haze touches, and the gold chains that hang the chandeliers, discolor and distort their shapes as you look at them.

<blank>

"Strong acid fog? What a thing!

<blank>

Philip, seeing this, exclaimed.

<blank>

It is a magic that manifests at a point and spreads over a small area.

If outdoors, it is a low-level magic that can hardly be expected to be effective due to atmospheric movement.

However, it is a different story if it is manifested in an indoor, enclosed space.

Its strong acidity, which corrodes gold instantly, causes sores on people's skin, blinds them, and burns their lungs when they breathe.

Lawrence used it indoors, in a crowded place.

<blank>

Lawrence grunted and tried to get out of the way, but Bona twisted his arm and pushed him to the floor.

The gadget rolls out of Lawrence's hand.

Karen quickly pulls Cordelia into a hug and puts her hands behind her back as if to protect her.

<blank>

Air wall!"

Dalton created a wall of wind toward the ceiling.

It spreads thinly and widely on the ceiling, creating a loose air current that collects the strong acid fog as it goes.

<blank>

Open the glass door!"

<blank>

At Dalton's cry, the servants at the window rush to open the large glass doors, which reach the ceiling, one after another.

<blank>

Water Drop Refining

Dalton unleashes another spell to match the air wall.

<blank>

The strong acid mist that was about to disperse is brought together and mixed by creating countless small droplets of water there.

When the servants had gathered them up into a ball about the size of a basketball, they released it out through the open window.

<blank>

You're as dexterous as ever."

<blank>

You're just as adept as ever."

<blank>

Bona calls out to Dalton, who dismisses the strong acid fog outward in a lean and flowing manner.

Dalton also had a few words to say back to Bona, who had assembled Lawrence with deftness.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... this to me! Don't think you can get away with this!"

<blank>

Lawrence, who was handed over to the guards who rushed to the scene, barked up to Bona and Dalton.

<blank>

I'm owed a favor by you, Karen! How dare you do this to me, to whom I owe so much? I told you how much I owe you, and you treat me like this! You ungrateful bastard!

<blank>

Lawrence yells at Karen as well, his face contorted with the pain of his shattered right wrist.

Karen gasps for a moment at Lawrence's exclamation, and then stiffens herself.

But remembering what this man had come to me for, I had no right to say such a thing. My hand trembled involuntarily.

<blank>

You've got to be kidding me!"

<blank>

Before Karen could even open her mouth, Cordilia jumped out of her arms and screamed.

<blank>

All you did was take something precious from her! All you have given her is sorrow and pain! And you, who call her ungrateful, are nothing but a disgrace!

<blank>

<blank>

You little bitch! You talk like you know what you're doing!

<blank>

Lawrence spits the words hatefully and roughly at Cordelia.

This time, Karen hid her at the shoulder to protect Cordelia.

<blank>

Uncle Niven's ...... No, Mr. Niven. I will never forget what you did. And I will not allow you to hurt anyone close to me any more.

<blank>

If you don't forgive me, what can you do? What can a helpless little girl do? All you can do is to kneel down and cry and beg my forgiveness!

<blank>

"Oh, your name is ......!"

<blank>

"That's enough, Cody."

<blank>

Bona stood in front of the Cordilleras, who tried to bite down further.

As if to tell his two daughters that they don't need to see any more filth, he interrupted Lawrence and his daughters.

<blank>

Take him away!"

<blank>

From the platform, Philip shouted to the two guards capturing Lawrence to take him away.

When the two guards responded to his voice and tried to draw Lawrence out of his foul-mouthed cursing while he continued to resist. ............

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

A gust of wind blew indoors at ----.

<blank>

<blank>

Many take shelter from the wind and shelter their eyes.

The open glass door was shaken by the wind and made a violent noise.

<blank>

Then a low man's scream echoes through the hall.

<blank>

The two guards who had secured Lawrence rolled on the floor, screaming in pain and rolling around.

The two guards had lost both arms from the elbows up.

<blank>

Lawrence sat there with both arms clasped in what had been the guard's hands.

<blank>

And a slender man standing by his side, wondering when he appeared.

<blank>

"Van ...... brother ...... sir?"

<blank>

His face spilled silvery white hair that was silky and habit-free.

Van Niven. Karen gives a guarded look to the man who has been standing there for some time.

<blank>

Hmmm... in this short period of time, you have even regained your memory? ......Well, you have made a farce of it in order to get him to lift the lid of his memory on his own. ...... It's true that if you pry it open from the outside, any part of the psyche can be distorted.

<blank>

Van notices Karen's gaze and looks back into her cold, squinty eyes, as if to say, interesting.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I told you I wouldn't let you get away with it!"

<blank>

There were more who jumped into the scene.

He rushes into the room from the garden side, where the glass door is open, and faces Van, pointing the tip of his two-handed sword at him and shouting with authority.

<blank>

He's not going to let up, Irving! This guy is tricky!"

<blank>

Then another. He clings to Irving and opens his arms to block his way.

<blank>

Irving? Brother!"

<blank>

Annie exclaimed as she checked on Irving and Will on the platform while being sheltered by Philip.

<blank>

I totally and completely agree with you about not letting them get away with it!"

<blank>

A guttural clap of both cuirasses and an inappropriate smile follows.

<blank>

Alicia senior!"

<blank>

When Karen saw him, she raised her voice.

Alicia noticed Karen and came over with a grin and a wink, shaking her ponytail.

For some reason, Cordelia's hand grips Karen's arm, and the strength in her hand is strong.

<blank>

<blank>

Van brushed off the guard's hand still attached to Lawrence's arm, put his right hand on his back for support, and helped him to his feet.

<blank>

Van! Do something about this place! At least take the girl's stone! The jewel that holds the key to the hidden temple! And we will return to Grouse Mill at all costs and rebuild! We still have supplies and troops ......"

<blank>

Father, it is a futile attempt."

<blank>

What?

<blank>

You have no more troops. That shallow meat eater has blundered. And that thing is more than you can handle.

<blank>

What the hell? What the hell is going on?

<blank>

"Your work here is done, Father."

<blank>

I'm going to go to the "What! ............? What the ......, you ......, what the ............... ..."

<blank>

The next moment, several thin spear-shaped objects sprang out from Lawrence's chest as if they had suddenly sprung from there.

Lawrence looked down at it as if he could not believe what he was seeing, and asked Van, standing behind him, why in the world?

<blank>

You once cursed the misery of being exploited, and you became empowered, turning from being the victim to being the doer. You wielded your power as a predator, longing for more and more and stronger.

<blank>

Without responding to the narrative, a bloodthirsty Lawrence kneels weakly at Van's feet.

The five fingers of the van were pulled out of his back. With a thud, Lawrence's body collapsed to the floor.

Van's fingernails were long and extended, sharp as daggers and smeared with Lawrence's blood.

<blank>

It's just that now the role has changed. It happens all the time.

<blank>

Van shakes his finger as if to brush the filth off his fingertips.

With a sound that cut the wind, drops of blood splattered on the floor.

<blank>

He says he doesn't need you anymore.

<blank>

Van Niven's mouth hangs brutally.

His eyes, narrow and sharp, were flickeringly red like a charcoal fire.
