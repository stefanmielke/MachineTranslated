# 106 Red Memory

My memories have always had the color red.

<blank>

A small red stone pendant given to me by my mother in celebration of my seventh.

Mother smiled kindly and put it around my neck, saying, "This will protect you.

I felt like a lot of things were said to me at that time, but now I hardly remember any of them.

The red stone in the center was not very big, but the red color was so beautiful that I was fascinated by it.

I am sure this is when I fell in love with the color red.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The bright red rose garden in the mansion.

A good friend of mine who used to come to the mansion when the arch of roses turned red.

The two of us would chase dragonflies in the garden of the mansion, and we would put woven garlands of flowers on each other's heads, oblivious to the time.

She was a dangerous child who often fell down, so I always held her hand. She had a dazzling happy smile, and I thought we would always be together.

I think I was seven or eight when we held hands in the roses, saying we were going to be friends forever.

The smiling face of the girl with the bright red roses on her back and her beautiful blonde hair shaking, still comes to my eyelids when I close my eyes.

<blank>

My favorite uncle, who always came to me in a bright red cape.

His uncle, who traveled around the world, came to the mansion once every few years, saying he was returning to his hometown.

I loved listening to stories about different countries on my uncle's big lap.

I remember hearing with surprise and great excitement that he was always working out because his body was his capital, and that he would fight even demonic beasts with just one body.

I remember once I adored that story of my uncle, and I clung to him to teach me how to fight, and I cried so hard that I greatly annoyed not only him, but also my father and mother.

I managed to get permission from my father and mother, and after my uncle taught me the kata and gave me a brief demonstration, he said, "You have good muscle," and patted me on the head with his large, martial palm, which made me very, very happy.

After telling him that if he continued to do what he had taught him until the next time he came back, he would train him to be stronger, my uncle set off again on his journey.

When he came back a year later, I showed him the results of my continuous efforts. He looked into my eyes and said, "You really have a good streak," and patted me on the head with a happy smile.

Then my uncle started to take my training seriously every time he came. I was eight years old.

That uncle has not been seen for more than five years.

A summer sunset seen by a family of five.

I saw the sunset with my brother on my right and my sister on my left, holding hands with my brother on my right and my sister on my left, my brother holding hands with my mother and my sister holding hands with my father, the five of us standing side by side.

The mountains and the houses were all red, and it was as if the whole world was on fire.

My brother and sister were so excited to see the bright red color of each other's faces that they untied themselves from our hands and hung to the edge of the balcony, where they had a great time comparing each other's faces to the reddened mountains.

I was worried that my brothers might fall off the balcony, so I positioned myself by the balcony railing with them.

Looking behind me as it was, I saw Father and Mother smiling quietly at me.

They were very quiet and cuddled up together, watching us. For some reason, I remember feeling very peaceful and very happy.

And that was the last sunset the family saw together.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

That day three years ago.

Even at this late hour, several large bonfires were lit to dig out the collapsed rocks, and the mountain seen from the house was illuminated with red lights, as if it were burning in a forest fire. I watched the red scene, which was different from the sunset, with my two younger brothers and sisters in my arms, without saying a word.

<blank>

<blank>

And that time when I arrived at the dormitory.

After spending a moment wandering around in a dream.

<blank>

Behind the door that the matron opened, a girl with hair shining like rubies was waiting.

It was as if there was lighting only there.

The surroundings are illuminated, sprinkled with sparkles like jewels.

My dim and colorless world seemed to regain its color.

Her ruby red hair was so dazzling that I couldn't take my eyes off her for a while.

And she greeted me with a kind smile.

The beautiful red light sprinkled around me gives me a sense of warmth.

The tea she brewed was also warm and seemed to slowly warm me to a much deeper level.

I felt safe beside her, as if something was unraveling in my chest.

After a few cups of tea, I was out of it and pleasantly sleepy.

The person, who identified herself as Lady Suzy Cloud, ......, led me to my bed and gently pulled the covers over me.

Oh, how long has it been since I have been able to go to bed so peacefully?

It had been years since I had fallen asleep so peacefully.

<blank>

It was as if something had been lifted, and from that day on I was able to laugh again, as I should have.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

I had heard that the redevelopment of the mine, which was an attempt to revive the business amidst the difficult management situation at Munanotos, was a vital part of my father's plan.

It was a fall that occurred when the mine began to operate successfully and Father and Mother went to inspect it.

<blank>

It was Uncle Lawrence of Grouse Mill who reached out to us just before a mining accident put Munanotos out of business in earnest.

My uncle had helped my father finance his mining business, and after the accident, he became our family's guarantor and backer.

I don't know what I would be doing now if it weren't for my uncle. I believe it is thanks to my uncle that I am still able to see my two younger siblings.

<blank>

Reilly is a little rough around the edges, but Uncle is kind enough to say a few words.

It is the same with his eldest brother, Van, who is the heir apparent.

I'm sorry Reilly is causing you so much trouble, Karen. I don't think he's a bad person at heart, but I think we've spoiled him too much. ...... I'm going to be very strict and ask you to give it some time."

That's what brother Van told me.

When I was attending school in Grouse Mill, I had a hard time many times with Reilly's hard hits. But when my patience was about to run out, Brother Van would always show up and comfort me with a gentle tone of voice.

Fortunately, thanks to Suzy, we are now in a position to keep our distance from Reilly and the others.

I guess that since he is now learning in Milia, he will no longer be able to be as selfish as a child.

I think that is what your brother Van is talking about when he says, 'look at the time'.

<blank>

Tables 3 and 5 have been cleared.

Table #6 will have the orange chiffon and Earl Grey, and table #7 will have the white Mont Blanc and triple honey pancakes! White Mont Blanc and three-tier honey pancakes are at table 7, so make no mistake!

""Yes!

<blank>

Alma Marma, who organizes the store's waitresses, is the one who is flying instructions to us.

He is a very experienced person who has been here since the store opened.

She looks around 20 years old, but her real age is different because she is an elf.

She is everyone's "trusty big sister.

<blank>

There are apparently more than 20 waitresses in this restaurant in total.

Including myself and Suzy and others, there are more than 10 members from our school.

Suzy and her family are absent today because they have to go to their consulate.

Cu Merle and Selkie Mau are also not here, so I am the only freshman.

<blank>

Karen seems to have gotten used to it by now.

Yeah, the danger is pretty much gone."

<blank>

In between running around in the halls, I took a moment to catch my breath, and was greeted by sophomore Elise Schard, a senior. She is a very beautiful person with striking purple hair and good style.

Another senior, Alpha Moonves, also a sophomore, is shorter and smaller than I am, but he is a very fast and reliable senior.

<blank>

Karen is very helpful because she notices the smallest of details.

Oh, thank you." If I can be of any help at all, ......"

No, really. You can tell right away if there is a stain on the curtains that you don't notice, or if the entrance mat is out of place. You can tell when a guest is about to call out to you, can't you?"

"......Eh, well, yes, ....... We do care about our clients' movements, so ......."

That's the way it is! That's the way it is, Alfa!"

I'm always thinking about how I can finish the work in front of me efficiently and connect it to the next one. Atashi, I am devoting my life to how efficiently I can finish the work in front of me and connect it to the next one!

So! Mr. Alma says calm down and do your job, okay? Alpha."

I am the woman who dies when I stop.

Shark!"

No, I'm often called a tuna. ......

Stop it! What are you making my junior listen to? I'm sorry, Karen. You don't have to listen to that lunatic's crap, so just forget it, okay?"

Yes?" ......, yes."

<blank>

For some reason, Ellis-senpai turned bright red, and Alpha-senpai muttered, "I'm just kidding. ......" as he turned toward the day after tomorrow.

I was a bit confused as to what kind of joke that was, so I had to nod vaguely.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Karen, that anklet of yours is so pretty and beautiful. And that red stone looks great on you.

Oh, thank you."

"It's a beautiful stone, isn't it? Is it a ruby?"

No, no, this is a magical device, it's not jewelry. ......

<blank>

Today's work was over, and as I was changing in the locker room, Alma complimented me on the anklet I was wearing on my ankle.

I wear them on a regular basis, but they are not visible to the outside eye because I always wear half boots at school.

But the store uniform is loafers, so the ankles are visible and these anklets are also out.

Alma had noticed it before and wanted to ask about the stone.

<blank>

"Oh, so it's a magic stone? A small calvatestone, perhaps?"

I'm not sure. I've heard it has a magical effect on support."

"Hmmm...I see...the stone is red, so I guess it's fire?"

So, I guess that means I can use Lifeforce or Vital?"

"Hmmm...you two are really good students of Milia, aren't you?"

<blank>

Ellis-senpai and Alpha-senpai, who noticed the stone, guessed its identity and effects.

Alma-san looked at the two seniors and nodded her head in admiration.

<blank>

<blank>

You're coming directly to the store tomorrow, right?"

Yes, I have permission to stay out tonight. ......

Take care on your way, and give my regards to your brother and sister. Did you bring them anything?"

"Yes, right here. Now if you'll excuse me."

<blank>

The two seniors saw me off and left the "big front yard".

Immediately, I put on the hood of my robe, which I borrowed from Suzy, to hide my face.

This robe has a weak but perceptual alienation effect.

<blank>

As I recall, he said, "When I went into the woods, I had a younger boy who was not yet used to hunting use it.

If they are equipped with this device, they will not be recognized if they are in a shallow area.

I didn't know what a 'shallow place' was, but I heard that it was good to be undetected by the dangerous beasts of the forest.

So even on the street, if you are equipped with this, you won't get tangled up with strange people, Suzy said.

<blank>

Then, he runs through the crowd by passing magic power through his anklet.

This magical equipment should raise the level of your own physical abilities. Maybe even improve your reflexes and make you feel very light.

Here, with the magic of riding the wind, you can run through people at incredible speeds.

<blank>

If you kick the cobblestone pavement, it will reach the roof of the building as if it were dancing in the wind.

It's still amazing! It's as if I don't feel any weight on my body!

The car can easily run on the roof and fly through the city, which is beginning to dim, towards its destination.

<blank>

Running like this reminds me of the days when I used to go to school in Grouse Mill every day.

It was a 20-kilometer uphill and downhill mountain road to the school, but running with the "Air Walk" made me feel good with the wind in my face.

No matter what was happening on the way to the destination, running was like playing with the wind, a time to forget everything.

<blank>

I was more of a physical person.

However, since she has such a high aptitude for magic that she has two attributes, she should pursue a career in magic, as Uncle Lawrence recommended. I think my current choice to study magic is not a mistake since Uncle Lawrence recommended that I should pursue a career in magic.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Soon, you will see the place you are aiming for. It is a blue-purple colored, slightly high pointed roof.

I am thankful for this anklet because I get there so quickly. It's a big shortcut from a path that would have taken us 20 minutes to get there on a normal walk.

I cannot thank the lender enough.

When I see you again someday when I return the favor, I will thank you to the best of my ability.

<blank>

About five minutes after leaving the store, I was able to knock on the front door of the facility where Dan and Nan were staying.

This is a private children's home called "Purple House". They are now being taken care of here.

With a subdued metallic clang, the knocker announces the arrival of a visitor to those behind the not-so-thick door.

Immediately, I heard a flapping sound of running inside the room.

<blank>

"Sister!"

Here you go, Dan. Nan.

<blank>

Both Dan and Nan's voices jumped on me at the same time as they shouted in unison about me.

Dan is a boy, Nan is a girl, and they are fraternal twins, both six years old this year. They are my twin brother and sister.

<blank>

It has been almost three years since their father and mother were killed in a cave-in accident. They were three years old at the time, but they have grown up to be so big and healthy.

Right now, being with these two is the only thing that brings me joy.

Tonight I have permission to stay out overnight, so I can sleep with them.

They are both very excited to have me over for the first time in a while.

See, the other kids are looking at you with surprised faces? Let's both calm down a little.

<blank>

Suzy and her friends were also going to stay overnight at the consulate tonight, and we had agreed to meet up with them tomorrow morning and go to work at the restaurant together.

After I told her that I have a twin brother and sister, Suzy had been asking me to introduce them to her and when we decided on this sleepover, she said happily, "Then I'll pick you up tomorrow morning and we can meet then! I'll pick you up tomorrow morning and we'll meet then!

Since we are taking them to see Susie tomorrow morning, we need to make sure they don't get too excited tonight and oversleep tomorrow.

<blank>

<blank>

As I was admonishing them, a first-aged man and woman came out from the back.

They are husband and wife, Boras and Vanilla, who run this facility together.

When Mr. Borras checked me out, he turned to me with a good-natured smile and greeted me politely.

<blank>

Oh, Mr. Boras and Vanilla. Thank you both for always taking care of us! I know it's not much, but please take this to buy something for everyone."

Thank you for your continued concern, Master Merlin. You are both so wise, and you are always a great help to us.

"Well, if it's not too much trouble for you, ......, oh, here's a cake I got from the store. I brought it for everyone to eat."

Oh my goodness, thank you for that. Let's all thank Dan-kun and Nan-chan's sister for their hospitality. Now, we all need to get our plates ready."

<blank>

I handed the money I earned in the union to Mr. Borras.

I have heard that these facilities depend on support and donations, so I always give the money I receive from my work to them, hoping to help in any way I can.

I am so grateful to Susie for taking me to the union with her. Thanks to her, I was able to help the facility so quickly.

Everyone except Dan and Nan replied cheerfully and began to prepare the plates. Let's be careful not to break the plates in our haste, shall we?

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, the sound of the front door being slammed echoed throughout the entire building.

It's a very messy beat at this hour.

<blank>

I think it's "...... Oh, oh, I think it's a town contact. It must be your neighbor Rodrigo. When that man gets drunk, he can be a little vague about the force of ......"

<blank>

Mr. Borras said it was okay, smiled annoyed, and headed for the front door.

I don't think it's very sensible behavior to come to a facility with children after drinking at this hour, even if it's just to contact them. ......

I still don't like drunk people.

<blank>

Sister!

What's wrong? Sister?"

Nothing, Dan, Nan. Come on, I'll cut you a chiffon cake. Open the middle of the table so everyone can see!"

Yes!"

<blank>

Let's not think about anything else today.

Because I want to spend more and more time with Dan and Nan at this limited time.
