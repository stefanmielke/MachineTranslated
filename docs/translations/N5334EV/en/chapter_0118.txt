# Chapter 106: Red Memories

Karen's Side

----------------

<b>

In my memories, there was always a red color.

<b>

A small red stone pendant I received from my mother for my seventh birthday.

My mother gently smiled and put it around my neck, saying, "This will protect you."

I feel like I was told many things at that time, but now I hardly remember any of it.

The design was not ornate, and the red stone set in the center was not large, but the color red was so beautiful that I became captivated by it.

Surely, it was at this time that I came to love the color red.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The bright red rose garden at the mansion.

Friends who often came to play at the mansion during the time when the rose arches were blooming red.

We chased dragonflies in the garden and forgot the time while weaving flower crowns, placing them on each other's heads.

I was a clumsy child who often nearly fell, so we always held hands. She had a dazzling smile, and I thought we would be together forever.

I believe it was around the age of seven or eight when we vowed to be eternal friends, holding hands among the roses.

Her smile, swaying her beautiful blonde hair against the backdrop of the bright red roses, still comes to mind when I close my eyes.

<b>

<b>

<b>

My beloved uncle, who always came wearing a bright red cloak.

He traveled around the world and would visit the mansion every few years, saying he was coming home.

I loved listening to the stories of various countries while sitting on my uncle's big lap.

I remember being amazed and excited as he told tales of how he trained his body, saying he fought magical beasts with just his physical strength.

I admired those stories so much that I clung to him, crying and begging him to teach me how to fight, which caused great trouble for him, as well as for my father and mother.

After somehow getting my parents' permission, I learned some techniques from my uncle and had a simple spar with him. When he said, "You have good potential," and patted my head with his large, rough hand, I was incredibly happy.

He left me with the promise that if I continued practicing what he taught me until his next visit, he would train me to become even stronger.

When he returned a year later and I showed him the results of my training, he opened his eyes wide and said, "You really have good potential," while happily patting my head.

From then on, every time my uncle visited, he would seriously watch my training. This was when I was eight years old.

I haven't seen that uncle for over five years now.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The summer sunset we watched as a family of five.

With my younger brother on my right and my younger sister on my left, we held hands and watched the sunset together, my brother with my mother and my sister with my father.

The mountains and the mansion were dyed bright red, as if the whole world was on fire.

My brother and sister, excited to see each other's faces turning bright red, broke free from our hands and ran to the edge of the balcony, comparing their red faces with the red mountains, laughing joyfully.

I was worried they might fall off the balcony, so I stayed close to the railing with them.

When I looked back, I saw my father and mother quietly smiling at us.

They were gently leaning against each other, watching us, and for some reason, I felt very peaceful and happy.

And that was the last sunset we watched together as a family.

<b>

<b>

<b>

That day three years ago.

Even late at night, several large bonfires were lit to dig up the fallen rocks, and the mountains seen from the mansion were illuminated in bright red, as if they were on fire like a wildfire. I stood there silently, holding my younger brother and sister, gazing at the scene that was different from the sunset.

<b>

<b>

And then, when we arrived at the dormitory.

After spending a moment that felt like wandering in a dream.

<b>

Behind the door opened by the dormitory supervisor, a girl with hair shining like rubies was waiting.

It was as if the light was shining only on her.

She scattered a jewel-like sparkle that illuminated the surroundings.

My dim and colorless world seemed to regain its vibrancy.

Her ruby-like shining red hair was so dazzling that I couldn't take my eyes off it for a while.

And she welcomed me with a gentle smile.

The beautiful red light surrounding her made me feel warmth.

The tea she brewed was warm and seemed to slowly warm me deep inside.

I felt a sense of security beside her, as if something was melting within me.

Before long, I felt drowsy and comfortable after sipping the tea.

She, who introduced herself as Suzy Cloud, led me to the bed and gently covered me with a blanket.

Ah, how long had it been since I could get into bed so peacefully?

How many years had it been since I fell asleep so calmly?

<b>

It was as if something had melted away, and from that day on, I could smile again as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

As the management of Munanotos became increasingly difficult, I heard that the reopening of the mine, aimed at revitalizing the business, was a project my father was particularly invested in.

It was during the inspection visit by my father and mother that the mine, which had just started operating safely, experienced a collapse.

<b>

Just before the mine accident made the management of Munanotos truly untenable, it was my Uncle Lawrence from Grusmil who extended a helping hand.

Since my uncle had provided financial assistance for the mine's management, he became our guarantor after the accident and supported us.

I can't imagine what would have happened if my uncle hadn't been there. I believe that I can still meet my younger siblings today thanks to him.

<b>

Rayleigh can be a bit rough, but my uncle speaks kindly.

The same goes for my older brother Van, the heir.

"It seems Rayleigh is causing trouble, Karen. I don't think he's a bad person at heart, but perhaps we've spoiled him too much... I'll have a serious talk with him, so could you give it some time?"

That's what my brother Van said.

When I was attending Grusmil's school, I often had a hard time with Rayleigh's harsh treatment. But whenever my patience was about to reach its limit, my brother Van would always appear, comforting me with his gentle tone.

Fortunately, thanks to Suzy, I have been able to maintain some distance from Rayleigh and the others.

After all, I am now a student at Miria, so I should no longer have to deal with childish whims.

I think what my brother Van means by "give it some time" is just that.

<b>

<b>

"I've finished cleaning tables three and five!"

"Please take water and take orders at table one. The orange chiffon and Earl Grey go to table six! The white Mont Blanc and three-tier honey pancakes are for table seven, so don't get them mixed up!!"

"Yes!!"

<b>

The one giving us instructions is Alma Malma, who oversees the waitresses at this establishment.

She has been here since the shop opened and is said to be a super veteran.

She looks to be in her twenties, but since she is an elf, her actual age is different.

She is everyone's "reliable older sister."

<b>

There are reportedly more than 20 waitresses at this shop.

Including myself and Suzy, more than ten of us belong to this establishment from our academy.

Today, Suzy and the others are taking a day off because they have to go to their own consulate.

Since Kuu Meruru and Selkie Mau are also absent, I am the only first-year student here.

<b>

"It seems you've gotten quite used to things, Karen-chan."

"Yeah, I've become much less clumsy."

<b>

During a brief moment to catch my breath while running around the hall, it was the second-year student, Elris Shard, who spoke to me. She is a very beautiful person with striking purple hair and a great figure.

And another second-year student, Alpha Moonbes, is shorter and petite but moves with great agility and reliability.

<b>

"Karen-chan, you notice the little details, which is really helpful."

"Ah, thank you. If I can be of any help at all..."

"No, really! You quickly fix things like unnoticed curtain stains or misaligned doormats. You can also sense when a customer is about to call out, right?"

"…Uh, y-yeah… I do pay attention to the customers' movements…"

"That's the spirit! That's exactly it, Alpha-chan!"

"Ah, y-yes, yes. I'm focused on how to finish the tasks in front of me as efficiently as possible and connect to the next one!"

"That's why Alma is telling you to stay calm while working, right? Alpha."

"I'll die if I stop."

"A shark?!"

"No, I'm often called a tuna…"

"Stop it!!! What do you think you're making the juniors listen to?! I'm sorry, Karen. You don't have to listen to the ramblings of a madwoman; just forget what you just heard, okay?"

"Huh?… Y-yes."

<b>

For some reason, Elris-senpai turned bright red, and Alpha-senpai muttered, "It was just a joke…" while looking away.

I didn't quite understand what kind of joke that was, so I could only nod ambiguously.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"That anklet of yours, Karen-chan, is cute and beautiful. That red stone really suits you."

"Ah, thank you."

"It's a beautiful stone. Is it a ruby?"

"N-no, this is a magical item, so it's not a gemstone…"

<b>

After finishing today's work and changing in the locker room, Alma-san complimented the anklet on my ankle.

I usually wear it, but since I always wear half boots at school, it isn't visible.

However, the shop's uniform has loafers, so my ankle is visible, and this anklet is also out in the open.

Alma-san had noticed it before and wanted to ask about the stone.

<b>

"Oh, so it's a magic stone? Is it a small Calvastone?"

"I-I'm not sure. I was told it has the effect of support magic."

"Hmm, I see. Since the stone is red, it must be fire attribute, right?"

"Then it can probably be used for Life Force or Vitality, I guess?"

"Hehe, both of you are truly students of Miria, aren't you?"

<b>

Elris-senpai and Alpha-senpai, who noticed the stone, began to speculate about its identity and effects.

Alma-san watched the two of them with an impressed nod.

<b>

<b>

"You're coming directly to the shop tomorrow, right?"

"Yes, I have permission to stay out tonight…"

"Be careful on your way back, and say hello to your younger brother and sister for me. Did you bring a souvenir?"

"Yes, it's right here. Well then, excuse me."

<b>

After being seen off by the two senpai, I left the "Large Front Yard."

Then, I immediately pulled the hood of the robe I borrowed from Suzy down deeply to hide my face.

This robe is said to have a weak but effective recognition obfuscation effect.

<b>

I remember hearing that it was used for younger juniors who weren't yet accustomed to hunting when entering the forest.

If I wear this, I can avoid being recognized by opponents in shallow areas.

I wasn't sure what "shallow areas" meant, but it seemed good enough to avoid being found by dangerous beasts in the forest.

So, Suzy said that if I wore this even in the city, I wouldn't be bothered by strange people.

<b>

Then, I channeled magic through the anklet and dashed through the crowd.

This magical item boosts my physical abilities. Probably, my reflexes have improved, and my body feels very light.

If I use wind magic while wearing this, I can run through the crowd at an unbelievable speed.

<b>

With a light kick against the cobblestones, I could reach the rooftops as if dancing in the wind.

This is amazing! I don't feel any weight on my body!

I can easily run across the rooftops and fly toward my destination in the city, which is beginning to be enveloped in twilight.

<b>

Running like this reminds me of the days when I used to commute to Grusmil's school every day.

The road to school was a steep mountain path of about 20 kilometers, but when I ran using "Air Walk," I felt like I was playing with the wind, and it was refreshing.

No matter what awaited me at my destination, while running, it felt like I could forget everything and just enjoy the moment.

<b>

I have always preferred physical activities.

However, since I have a high magical aptitude, possessing two attributes, and was encouraged by Uncle Lawrence to pursue a path in magic, my current choice to enter the magic department is probably not a mistake.

<b>

<b>

<b>

And soon, I could see my destination. It was a slightly elevated building with a blue-purple pointed roof.

Since I arrived so quickly, I am grateful for this anklet. Normally, it would take about 20 minutes to walk this distance, but I arrived much faster.

I can't thank the person who lent it to me enough.

When we meet again someday, I will express my utmost gratitude.

<b>

After about five minutes of leaving the shop, I knocked on the door of the facility where Dan and Nan are.

This is a private children's care facility called "Purple House." The two of them are being taken care of here.

With a modest metallic sound, I knocked, announcing my arrival to those on the other side of the not-so-thick door.

And soon, I heard the sound of footsteps running from inside.

<b>

"Big sister!"

"Sorry to keep you waiting, Dan, Nan."

<b>

As Dan and Nan called out my name in unison, they jumped at me.

Dan is a boy, and Nan is a girl; they are fraternal twins who are both six years old this year. They are my younger twin siblings.

<b>

It has been almost three years since our father and mother passed away in the collapse accident. The two who were three years old at that time have grown so big and healthy now.

Being with these two is my only joy now.

Since I have permission to stay out tonight, I can sleep with them.

Both of them are very excited about my long-awaited stay.

Look, the other kids are watching with surprised faces, right? Let's calm down a bit, you two.

<b>

Tonight, Suzy and the others are also staying at the consulate, and we planned to meet in the morning and go to the shop together.

Since I mentioned that I have younger twin siblings, Suzy has been asking to meet them, and when the plan for my overnight stay was decided, she happily said, "Then I'll come to pick you up in the morning, and I'll meet them then!"

Since I will be introducing the two to Suzy tomorrow morning, I need to make sure they don't get too excited tonight and oversleep.

<b>

<b>

As I was calming them down, an elderly couple appeared from the back.

They are Mr. Boras and Mrs. Vanilla, who run this facility together.

When Mr. Boras saw me, he greeted me with a warm smile and a polite bow.

<b>

"Ah, Mr. Boras, Mrs. Vanilla. Thank you for always taking care of the two! It's not much, but please use this to buy something for everyone."

"Oh my, thank you for your thoughtfulness, Miss Marlin. Both of them are very clever, and we are always grateful for their presence."

"Is that so? If they are not causing any trouble… Ah, this is a cake I brought from the shop. I thought everyone could have some."

"Oh my, thank you very much. Everyone, let's thank Miss Dan and Nan's big sister! Now, we need to prepare some plates together."

<b>

I handed the money I earned from the union to Mr. Boras.

I heard that facilities like this operate on donations and support funds, so I always give them the money I earn from my work, hoping to help in any way I can.

I am truly grateful to Suzy for taking me to the union. Thanks to her, I was able to contribute to the facility so quickly.

Everyone, including Dan and Nan, responded cheerfully and began preparing the plates. Hehe, let's be careful not to break any plates in our haste, okay?

<b>

<b>

At that moment, a loud knocking sound echoed throughout the building.

Even at this hour, it was quite a rough knocking.

<b>

"…Ah, I think it's a neighborhood notification. It must be Mr. Rodrigo from next door. When he drinks, he tends to lose his sense of strength a bit…"

<b>

Mr. Boras smiled helplessly as he assured us everything was fine and headed toward the entrance.

Even if it's for a notification, I don't think it's very sensible to come to a facility with children at this hour after drinking…

I really don't like drunk people.

<b>

"Big sister!"

"What is it? Big sister?"

"It's nothing, Dan, Nan. Now, let's cut the chiffon cake. Let's open up the middle of the table so everyone can see while we cut it!"

"Yes!!"

<b>

For now, I'll stop thinking about unnecessary things.

During this limited time, I want to cherish every moment with Dan and Nan.
