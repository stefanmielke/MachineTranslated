# 19 Susie Cloud's First Day of School

Come on! The number of characters will be bumped up from here! (Explosion)


----------------

<blank>

'Susie, would you be interested in going to school to see?'

<blank>

It was two days after I became Suzy Cloud that Henry told me this.

<blank>

It was sudden, and I was just getting a raspberry tart, so I tilted my head with my fork in my mouth, a little embarrassed.

<blank>

"In about two weeks, this term will be over. ......

'Hmmm, I was thinking that school would eventually... but is it okay if I go before the end of this semester?'

Yes, after this period we will be on a long vacation, and the beginning of the school year is two months away. Wouldn't it be better for you to spend two months of summer with friends your own age instead of spending it alone? I think it would be better for you to spend two months of summer with friends your own age rather than spending it alone.

'Indeed! That's for sure! Let's get ready as soon as possible! Henry, can you take care of the formalities?"

I'll leave it to you. I have already talked to Daisy about this. It is her opinion that I should go to school this term."

<blank>

Who is Ms. Daisy? I asked.

<blank>

Daisy is my wife who made this tart, and she is also a school teacher in the village of Amkham."

<blank>

He told me.

I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I understand! By the way, you mentioned that Daisy made the cherry pie the other day!

There's something wonderful about a teacher who is good at baking!

<blank>

But I think the development is too sudden. ......?

<blank>

Does Susie not like going to school?"

No, I'd like to, but I'm a little nervous.

<blank>

Isn't it difficult for an unidentified person, who doesn't even know where he/she came from, to suddenly fit in at a school? Normally, people would be wary, right?

When I tell them that.　I said, "That's not true!　I said,

<blank>

Mr. Howard told me that the village of Amkamu values the strong, and that if I could get Mr. Howard's approval and also show that I had defeated Wolf, the people of the village would accept me without any problems.

<blank>

What's that? A gymnastic hamlet? I'm a little taken back.

<blank>

Well, I thought there would be no problem, so I decided to go to the school from the beginning of the week.

<blank>

I was thinking at ...... that when our Howard Dad decides to do something like this, he has a tremendous ability to follow through.

They quickly make arrangements and get things done in no time at all.

<blank>

Is this what you call a managerial personality? Well, if Mr. Shacho is like this, we can all go along with him without any worries!

I'm a little proud of myself.

<blank>

<blank>

When I went home and told her about the school, it seemed to turn off something in Sonia.

Is your nose breathing strangely? What, are you putting more effort into it than you should?

The next day, Sonia and I decided to go to town to get a few things for me.

<blank>

The first time is the crucial time, so you have to be well equipped! says Sonia-mama.

Is the equipment....let's see, is there a battle? It's a school, right?

<blank>

<blank>

Sonia's legs are not strong to begin with, and although she has no problem moving around the house, she is unable to stand for long periods of time or walk long distances.

He said that when he goes away, he uses a wheelchair as well as a horse-drawn carriage.

<blank>

Even in the house, he leaves the heavy lifting to Elrose, as it is hard on his legs to carry too many heavy things.

<blank>

This is! I must properly support Sonia-mama! Physically! Mentally!

<blank>

On the way to town, the carriage was steered by Sonia.

I admire you even more that you are not just a ...... classy lady to be able to do this.

<blank>

But I have to learn to steer the car too, to reduce the burden on Sonia-mama! I made a mental note to do so.

<blank>

On the road, it was just the two of us with Sonia, and I was strangely excited about something, so we talked a lot again about a lot of unimportant things.

<blank>

But the secret is that it was mostly about food!

He also promised to teach me how to cook a little from now on.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The road leading to the town ...... Copetown is made of red earth, which contrasts with the translucent green of the grass and trees around the road, making it easy on the eyes.

Wheat fields spread out peacefully, and woods and forests with clusters of trees appear in places.

Although not as high as Deipala, the peaks of the mountains in a light purple haze can be seen in the distance to the south.

Such a view was pleasing to my eyes from the carriage.

<blank>

The sky was a dazzling, piercing deep sky blue, and a mass of white clouds without height were being swept away by the wind.

<blank>

Holding my hat in the wind, I inhale the breeze with all my might, and the smell of wheat, greenery, and sky fills my chest, making me feel very good.

<blank>

Sonia looked at me with loving eyes as I did so.

<blank>

I was embarrassed when our eyes met, but for some reason that made me very happy.

<blank>

<blank>

We used a horse-drawn carriage to get to town, but Sonia's hand was always taken as we walked to the stores.

<blank>

I laugh and say, "Don't worry so much, I'll be fine.　I laugh and say, but I'm ...... worried! I won't let go of your hand!

<blank>

A fashion show was held at the store!

Audience, Sonia Mama. Model, Susie Cloud.

<blank>

Well, in short, a dress-up doll? They are dressed this way and that way, and Sonia-mama chooses the clothes and goes .......

<blank>

There are also hats, shoes, new baskets, stationery, and finally underwear.

<blank>

I was a little embarrassed to wear underwear, but Sonia was in high spirits, and she chose a wide range of underwear, from cute little ones to slightly more adult-like ones.

But what about silk string pants and quirky 13 year olds? I thought so. ......

<blank>

It's what you don't see that counts when it comes to a woman's personal appearance!　I can't say anything if you say with a straight face.

<blank>

After all the shopping was done, I asked the shopkeeper to carry my bags to the carriage and load them, and a pile was formed on the back of the ...... cart.

I couldn't help but look at Sonia-mama and laugh at each other.

<blank>

We need Howard to do his best," said Sonia with a dazzling smile.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The morning of the day of school was difficult.

No, actually, it was hard from the day before when I was choosing what to wear. ...... What to wear? Sonia and Elrose argued and argued over what to wear.......

<blank>

In the end, it became a pinafore to wear.

Well, it's called an apron dress.

This is the one that is not a jumper skirt.

It has huge ruffles on the shoulders like feathers, and the ribbons at the back are huge.

<blank>

The dress worn under the apron is apple green.

The skirt is also voluminous with many pleats.

The ruffles at the hem are large, and the collar is also large and ruffled.

The sleeves are fluffy and long buff.

<blank>

On her feet are ruby red lace-up boots in a color similar to her hair.

Rounded tips and thick soles.

It's strung from the instep to the end of the tube with a thin black cord.

<blank>

Her hair is in a pigtail, not a twin-tail, with a zigzag parting in the back and tied up on both sides.

The hair is tied up with a vivid light blue hair string to form a large bowknot.

...... is kind of an overabundance of cute ingredients in this whole thing!

<blank>

I feel like a princess somewhere, don't I?

I said to Sonia, shyly and jokingly, "Oh, what? Suzy is a princess, right?　I was told with a straight face again.

<blank>

What do you want me to do?

You will die of shame!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The school is located about 5 km in a straight line from the Cloud residence.

<blank>

Surrounded by a windbreak of evergreen trees, it was a church-like building with white exterior walls and a blue gable roof.

Bells can be seen hanging from a tower extending from the building.

<blank>

Since it was Susie's first day at school, she rode to school in a carriage driven by Howard.

<blank>

<blank>

In the office in the school building, I was greeted by Mrs. Jameson, Daisy Jameson.

<blank>

He is in his mid-thirties.

Her dark brown hair is braided and pulled back into a bun.

Overall, her hair is very shiny with no trailing hair and is carefully groomed.

The grayish-brown eyes, which exude intelligence, and the small glasses that hang over them.

And she had a friendly smile.

<blank>

Oh, she's an office worker who can do her job. And she seems to be in a responsible position!　is Suzy's inner voice.

<blank>

She was dressed in a loose-fitting white blouse and a cold-colored, subdued-patterned scarf wrapped around her like a necktie, giving her an overall clean look.

The tight skirt above the knee and black stockings really give her a female teacher look.

<blank>

<blank>

Once there, Susie was taken by Daisy and escorted to the classroom.

However, when she and Howard had to go through paperwork, Daisy called for one of the girls in the classroom, who left Susie in charge and went back to the office.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

My name is Beatrice Croquis! My father has told me all about you!

<blank>

The girl had back-curled, loosely wavy, tobiko hair that was slicked back with a catsuit, exposing her ample, broad forehead.

Her fine, tight eyebrows and large amber eyes, which looked golden in some lights, both reflected the child's intelligence.

The corners of her mouth turned up fearlessly, and her moderately scattered freckles seemed to show her strong spirit.

<blank>

She is somewhat smaller than Susie.

The line of sight drops a little.

It was the first time I met someone smaller than myself when I first came here. I'm a little happy.

<blank>

Susie Cloud...it's...nice to meet you...sir!

I'm Bee, Tris, or whatever you want to call me! You can call me Bee, Tris, or whatever you want!"

So... Bear child?"

I said, "Wait a minute! Why? I don't know, but I don't like the sound of ......!

...hmm...so...bayan?"

What?" No. ...... No! What is it? Something even worse than the last one! I don't know what it is!

Mmm?"

Hmm, hmm! Well, okay! Let's just get along! Let me introduce you to my girl! Mia!

I said, "Oh, um, my name is ...... Mia Mathieson. Nice to meet you."

I'm going to go to "・・・・・・・ eh? ... Oh... Oh, Suzy... Is it a cloud ・・・・・・・・? ... is ・・・・・・ desu."

I'm going to go to "...... What? Huh? Huh?"

<blank>

The girl who introduced herself to Beatrice and somewhat flustered introduced herself as Mia was much taller than Suzy.

He looks to be 160 centimeters tall.

<blank>

Her hair is ash blonde with a slight bluish tinge, and her bangs are naturally slicked back at the level of her eyebrows.

Her long, almost waist-length back hair was braided into a loose braid and dropped forward over her right shoulder.

The blue eyes of the ultramarine, like a cluster of blues, are very calm and reassuring to the viewer.

And ..........

<blank>

All three of us are the same age!"

<blank>

What?　Suzy, whose eyes widened, looked back at Beatrice.

I know," Beatrice says, putting her hands on her hips and raising her eyebrows with half-open eyes!　Beatrice says, putting her hands on her hips and raising her eyebrows with half-lidded eyes.

<blank>

Suzy looks back at Mia again.

Its gaze goes from its neck down to .......

Dear fallen meat who sits there majestically!

<blank>

Damn!

<blank>

I couldn't help but scream in anguish.

<blank>

What? Huh? Huh?"

<blank>

Mia is puzzled as to what is wrong, and Beatrice shakes her head yare-yare.

<blank>

(Hey, what the heck! What the hell is this suicup? I guess it's an F! G shock! ...... She's 13 years old? What a thing to say! ......

I'm sorry! I called myself a Toisy Rose! I was conceited! I was conceited! The real one is here!

Duh! But what is this! My eyes are happy and my heart is filled with a sense of defeat! If I'm not careful, my knees will shatter and I'll end up with my hands on my knees! Agh!)

<blank>

Kuh! And when I look away, Beatrice is there.

Ah, yes, this is what age looks like. A sense of relief enveloped Suzy.

<blank>

What did you just see that made you feel safe? Where did you just look for reassurance?

What?

<blank>

Susie looks further into the day after tomorrow.

<blank>

I'll tell you something! I'm in the growth phase! I'm growing up!

I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm..! I... am... a... growth... fan!"

You know what I'm talking about!"

<blank>

Hm! and the two girls sniffle, hold hands, and nod to each other.

We seem to understand each other.

<blank>

Oh, what? Let's see... ...... Nice to meet you, okay? Susie-chan."

<blank>

One person was Mia, who was not keeping up with the situation.

<blank>

<blank>

What's up? You look like you're having a lot of fun!

<blank>

When Suzy turned around to hear a voice behind her, she saw a tall girl standing there.

<blank>

She is only slightly shorter than Mia, but her confident appearance makes her appear larger than the others.

Her brunette hair, long and tied back, shone cherry red in the light, and her cat-like eyes sparkled like aquamarines.

<blank>

I just finished introducing myself! Susie, let me introduce you! The big one over here is Dana. The little one is Colin. They're both one level above us!

Ha-ha-ha! By the way... how nice of you, isn't it? I'm Dana McCain. I'm Dana McKane and you're the girl I've heard so much about. ...... It's nice to meet you! Nice to meet you!

'Tiny ...... is terrible. I'm not that different from Bibi and I'm ......, sorry for all the fuss, okay? I'm Colin Saunders. Nice to meet you Susie."

Susie Cloud...it's nice to meet you...please...come in..."

<blank>

There was another girl in Dana's shadow.

The petite girl who gave her name as Colin was not much taller than Beatrice.

She is an elegant girl with calm dirty blonde hair that is later braided down in a fishbone.

Behind his large round glasses, his bluish-gray eyes softly look out at everyone.

<blank>

Wow, cat-eyed and tangerine-eyed sisters," Suzy said to herself.

<blank>

Rumor?

It's a rumor, u-wa-sa. A beautiful girl with great skills appears! I mean, ......!"

Bwhooooo!"

<blank>

Susie blew it.

<blank>

"Soooooo...? ... huh?"

<blank>

Mia and Colin, who shouted, "Oh?　Mia and Colin say

<blank>

I'm all for strongmen in this village," he said! Especially when they are this cute!"

<blank>

Suddenly, he hugs me on the shoulder and slides his cheek against me.

<blank>

Oh! Dana, it's not fair! Me too, me too!"

"Fubue hehehe...?"

<blank>

On the other cheek, Colin was in close contact with me, and my cheek was sandwiched and rubbed together by the two of them, causing me to make funny noises.

Oh, my God! You look like a doll!　Colin said! It's as soft and fluffy as a baby's!　Dana cheered.

Mia was second-guessing whether to go or go back around it.

They want to cuddle together.

<blank>

Beatrice sighs in frustration.

<blank>

Oh, my gosh, even the smell is so cute! Even the smell is cute! Hehe! Kara and her friends are going to be so disappointed!

Kara is the most senior student, one level above Dana and her friends! There are two more, Jessica and Alicia! All three of them graduate next week, so they only come here once in a while!"

<blank>

Beatrice explained, but Suzy was having none of it.

<blank>

<blank>

The two of them are squirming around, and before long they are joined by Mia, who is hugging them behind their backs, making things very difficult.

For what it's worth, both upperclassmen have more magnificent chests than Suzy.

Both arms and backs are swallowed by waves of rich flesh.

<blank>

It is like a small boat being swallowed and tossed about by the surging waves against the stormy sea.

<blank>

 Is this heaven? My back! My arms! I'm wrapped in a happy sensation!

I'm so glad I'm alive! (Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ！！！！)

<blank>

Aaahh...! Hyahhhh..! Huff!

<blank>

There was Suzy, swung up and down, a whirling, whirling eyeball.

<blank>

<blank>

It's getting kind of noisy!"

<blank>

Beatrice mutters in dismay as the younger children look on in the distance.

<blank>

And then someone came along to add even more noise.

<blank>

Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh? Isn't that Suzy? Why? Why are you in the classroom? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

<blank>

As soon as they came flapping into the classroom, they started shouting and making a lot of noise.

<blank>

Oh... Huh? Irving? ...Hello?

What's the matter, Susie? What are you doing here? Ah! Is Susie going to school too? Are you going to be with us from now on? Yay!!! ！！！！"

<blank>

Irving was about to hug Suzy when Beatrice entered the room and blocked his way.

<blank>

Hey, Irving, what are you talking about? Irving, what are you talking about? How do you know about this girl?

Ugh." Bibi! Nothing! It doesn't matter!

<blank>

Mmm! and Beatrice raises her eyebrows.

<blank>

I met you the other day in the woods when we were collecting the two-headed bore, didn't I? Furey said you were sloppily stretching your nose!

""Of! I didn't stretch it!

'Hmmm...... I see! ...... Irving is still so fast, isn't he? ...hmmm, I see!

No, no! Bibi! No! That's not what I meant!

<blank>

Under the nose? Did it grow?　Suzy tilted her head....

<blank>

"Brother Frey?"

<blank>

Who's that? asked Dana.

<blank>

Fred McCain. I was with Irving the other day collecting a bore, don't you remember? He has the same hair and eye color as me. ......"

<blank>

Hmm~? Was there such a person?　Susie thinks, tilting her head once again.

<blank>

"Oh... I'm so sorry for your loss, Frey. ......"

<blank>

Sadly, Dana shook her head.

<blank>

<blank>

Another boy approached Suzy in the midst of such chaos.

<blank>

She is much shorter than Suzy, with curly reddish-brown hair, a freckled face, and denim overalls with the sleeves of the shirt she wears inside rolled up sloppily.

<blank>

I'll be damned! He is the picture of a mischievous little boy.

<blank>

And as Suzy looks at him with half admiration, the child also looks up at Suzy with his sparkling blue eyes wide open in curiosity.

<blank>

The girl came right up to Susie and suddenly, without any preamble, rolled up her skirt.

<blank>

The fabric of the skirt, rolled up, spreads wide.

The light blue silk string panties, which had just been unloaded that day, were exposed to the public in all their glory.

<blank>

For a moment, it was as if time had stopped.

<blank>

Suddenly, the surrounding girls stopped moving, their eyes wide with astonishment, while the boys close to their age who were witnessing the event throbbed with joy.

<blank>

Damn! You badass Stefan! Shit! Hold on!

<blank>

Dana was the first to react, but the boy called Stefan fled like a gust of wind.

<blank>

I'm so proud of you! Stefan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Irving?

'Yes, sir! Boys! You shouldn't stare so much.

"Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...oh..! I've never... been... ripped... off... before!"

"Oh, ...... Suzy? I don't think you're supposed to be impressed there, I think you're supposed to be angry."

<blank>

Entropy in the classroom further increased.



<blank>

----------------

Finally...yay! I was able to get the lucky guy to show up! ...... was a long time(+_+)
