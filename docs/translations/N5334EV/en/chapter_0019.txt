# Chapter 19: Suzy Cloud's First Day at School

Alright! From here on, the characters are going to increase rapidly! (LOL)

----------------

<b>

"Ms. Suzy, would you be interested in attending school?"

<b>

It was two days after I became Suzy Cloud when Mr. Henry said that to me.

<b>

It was sudden, and I was just enjoying a raspberry tart, so I tilted my head slightly with a fork still in my mouth, feeling a bit embarrassed.

<b>

"There's only about two weeks left in this term, though..."

"Hmm, I was considering school eventually... but is it alright to go within this term?"

"Yes, after this term, there will be a long vacation, and the new school year starts in two months. Wouldn't it be better to spend those two months with friends around the same age rather than alone? That's what I think."

"Indeed! That's absolutely right! Let's get ready right away! Henry, can you handle the procedures?"

"Leave it to me. I've already discussed this with Daisy. In fact, it was her suggestion to go to school within this term."

<b>

Who is Ms. Daisy? I asked.

<b>

"Daisy is my wife who made this tart and is also a teacher at the school in Amukam village."

<b>

He told me.

Oh! Speaking of which, you mentioned that Ms. Daisy made the cherry pie the other day!

A teacher who is good at baking is quite wonderful!!

<b>

But, it feels like the development is a bit too sudden... doesn't it?

<b>

"Does Suzy dislike going to school?"

"No... I want to... go... but... I'm a little... worried?"

<b>

Isn't it difficult for an unknown person whose background is unclear to suddenly blend into a school? Normally, wouldn't they be cautious?

When I conveyed such thoughts, Mr. Howard said, "That's not the case!"

<b>

According to Mr. Howard, in Amukam village, there is a trend of valuing the strong, and with Mr. Howard's endorsement and the achievement of defeating a wolf, the villagers would accept me without any problem...

<b>

What is that? An athletic village? That's a bit off-putting.

<b>

Well, that’s why it was decided that I would start attending school from the beginning of the week without any issues.

<b>

...I thought about it, but once my dad Howard decides on something, his follow-through is incredible.

He quickly makes arrangements and moves things along rapidly.

<b>

Is that what they call an entrepreneurial spirit? Well, with a president like him, everyone can feel secure following along!

Hehe, I felt a bit proud.

<b>

<b>

Then, when I got home and told my family about school, it seemed like something switched on in Sonia.

She was unusually excited? W-wait, isn't she putting in a bit too much effort?

The next day, Sonia and I decided to go to town together to gather various things for me.

<b>

Since the first impression is important, Sonia said we must prepare properly! 

Equipment? Is there... combat involved?! This is school, right?!

<b>

<b>

It was only then that I learned that Sonia originally had weak legs. While she had no problem moving around the house, she couldn't stand for long periods or walk long distances.

She mentioned that when going on long trips, she also used a wheelchair besides a carriage.

<b>

Even at home, if she carries something too heavy, it puts a strain on her legs, so she leaves the heavy work to Elrose.

<b>

This is it! I have to support Sonia properly! Physically! Mentally!!

<b>

On the way to town, Sonia handled the carriage.

I was even more impressed to find out she could do such things... she’s not just a refined lady.

<b>

But to reduce Sonia's burden, I also need to learn to handle the carriage! I etched that into my heart.

<b>

During the journey, it was just Sonia and me, and we were unusually high-spirited, chatting about all sorts of things.

<b>

But it was a secret that most of the conversation was about food!

We also promised to gradually teach each other cooking.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The road to the town... to Coop Town was packed with red soil, and the contrast with the transparent green of the surrounding grass and trees was easy on the eyes.

The tranquil expanse of wheat fields and the clusters of trees peeking out here and there.

Though not as tall as the Dipaura, the peaks of the faintly purple mountains visible in the distance to the south.

Such scenery was delighting my eyes from atop the carriage.

<b>

The sky was a dazzling deep sky blue, with low, white clouds drifting in the wind.

<b>

As I held onto my hat against the wind and took a deep breath, the scents of wheat, greenery, and sky filled my chest, making me feel very good.

<b>

Sonia was watching me with affectionate eyes.

<b>

I felt embarrassed when our eyes met, but for some reason, it made me very happy.

<b>

<b>

We used the carriage to get to town, but we walked to the shop, so I held Sonia's hand the whole time.

<b>

"You don't have to worry so much, it's fine!" she said with a smile... but I'm worried! I won't let go of your hand!!

<b>

At the shop, a fashion show was held!

Audience: Sonia. Model: Suzy Cloud.

<b>

In short, it was like a dress-up doll? I was dressed in various outfits, with Sonia choosing them... 

<b>

There were also hats, shoes, a new basket, stationery, and finally, underwear.

<b>

Underwear was a bit of a high hurdle and embarrassing, but Sonia was in high spirits, choosing a wide range from cute to slightly adult-like items.

However, I wondered if something like silk string panties was really appropriate for a 13-year-old... 

<b>

When she said, "The unseen aspects of a woman's grooming are important!" with a serious face, I couldn't say anything.

<b>

After finishing all the shopping and having the clerk carry and load our things onto the carriage... a mountain of items had formed in the back.

Sonia and I exchanged glances and burst into laughter.

<b>

"We need to make sure Howard helps out too," Sonia said with a dazzling smile.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The morning of the day I was to go to school was hectic.

Actually, it had been hectic since the day before when we were choosing what to wear... What should I wear? Sonia and Elrose were arguing back and forth...

<b>

In the end, I decided to wear a pinafore.

Well, it's an apron dress, I guess.

Not a jumper skirt.

It had big frills on the shoulders like wings, and the ribbon in the back was also quite large.

<b>

The dress I wore under the apron was apple green.

It also had many pleats in the skirt, making it voluminous.

The hem frills were large, and the collar was big with frills.

The sleeves were long and puffed out.

<b>

On my feet were ruby red lace-up boots that matched my hair color.

The tips were rounded, and the soles were thick.

They were tightened with black thin laces from the instep to the toe.

<b>

My hair was styled in pig tails, with a zigzag parting in the back and tied on both sides.

The ties were vivid blue hair ribbons, making large bows.

...Isn't this a bit too cute overall!?

<b>

I feel like a princess from somewhere, right?

When I jokingly said this to Sonia, she replied seriously, "Oh? Suzy is a princess, you know?"

<b>

What am I supposed to do about that!?

I'm going to die of embarrassment!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The school is located about 5 kilometers in a straight line from the Cloud residence.

<b>

It was surrounded by a windbreak of evergreen trees and looked like a church with white walls and a blue gabled roof.

I could see a bell hanging in the tower extending from the building.

<b>

Since it was Suzy's first day, she rode to school in the carriage driven by Howard.

<b>

<b>

Inside the school office, she was welcomed by Mrs. Jameson, also known as Daisy Jameson.

<b>

She appeared to be in her mid-thirties.

Her dark brown hair was braided and gathered into a bun at the back.

Overall, her hair was neatly styled with no stray hairs and had a beautiful sheen.

Her grayish-brown eyes conveyed intelligence, and she wore small glasses.

She was a woman with a friendly smile that left a strong impression.

<b>

Ah, she seems like a capable office worker. Moreover, she looks like she holds a responsible position! thought Suzy's inner voice.

<b>

Her outfit consisted of a loose white blouse, a scarf with a calm pattern wrapped like a tie, giving an overall clean impression.

The knee-length tight skirt and black stockings gave her a very teacher-like appearance.

<b>

<b>

For a moment, Suzy was led by Daisy to the classroom.

However, since Howard had paperwork to handle, Daisy called over a girl who was in the classroom and entrusted Suzy to her before returning to the office.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I’m Beatrice Kuroki! I've heard about you from my father!"

<b>

The girl had wavy hair that reached her back, held back with a headband, exposing her broad forehead.

Her finely shaped eyebrows and large amber eyes, which sometimes appeared golden in the light, reflected her intelligence.

With a confident smirk and a sprinkle of freckles, she seemed to embody a strong spirit.

<b>

She was slightly shorter than Suzy.

Her gaze was a bit lower.

This was the first time Suzy met someone shorter than her since coming here. It made her a little happy.

<b>

"...I'm Suzy Cloud... nice to meet you!"

"Nice to meet you! You can call me Bea or Tris, however you like!"

"...Then... Bea-chan?"

"Wait a minute! Why? I don't really get it, but... I don't like that sound very much!"

"...Hmm... then... Bea-yan?"

"Huh? No... no! What is it? It sounds even worse than the previous one! I don't really understand it, though!!"

"...Muu?"

"Y-yeah! Well, that's fine! For now, let's get along! Oh, let me introduce this girl too! Mia!"

"Ah, um... I'm Mia Mathison. Nice to meet you."

".........Eh? ...Ah... I'm Suzy... Cloud... ...yes? ...yes... ...yes."

"......Eh? Um? Huh?"

<b>

Introduced by Beatrice, Mia, who seemed a bit flustered, was significantly taller than Suzy.

She looked to be about 160 centimeters tall.

<b>

Her hair was an ash blonde with a slight bluish tint, naturally flowing at eyebrow height.

Her long hair reached her waist, loosely braided, and fell over her right shoulder.

Her ultra-marine blue eyes gathered like a cluster of blue, giving a gentle and reassuring feeling.

And.........

<b>

"We're all the same age!"

<b>

What?! Suzy's eyes widened as she turned to Beatrice.

That's right! Beatrice said, placing her hands on her hips and raising an eyebrow.

<b>

Suzy looked back at Mia.

Her gaze traveled down from her neck...

And there, proudly sitting, was the embodiment of voluptuousness!!

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

I couldn't help but let out a groan.

<b>

"Eh? What? Huh?"

<b>

Mia looked confused, and Beatrice shook her head in exasperation.

<b>

(What the heck is this!!! What is this watermelon cup!? Estimated F! No! G!? The shock of G! ...Is this really 13 years old?! What is this... ugh!

I'm sorry!! I was so arrogant to call myself Toyshi Rose! I was so conceited! The real deal is right here!!!

Ugh! But what is this!? My eyes are filled with joy, yet this overwhelming sense of defeat wells up from the depths of my heart!! If I let my guard down, my knees might buckle, and I might end up on the ground!!! Ahhh!)

<b>

Ugh! When I averted my gaze, there was Beatrice.

Ah, that's right, this is what is appropriate for my age. A sense of relief enveloped Suzy.

<b>

"Hey! Where were you looking to feel relieved?!"

"…Eh?"

<b>

Suzy turned her gaze further away.

<b>

"I'll have you know! I'm in my growth period! G-R-O-W-T-H P-E-R-I-O-D!!"

"Well! I... I'm in my growth... period too!!"

"I knew you understood!"

<b>

With a huff, the two girls clasped their hands and nodded at each other.

It seemed they understood each other.

<b>

"Ah, um... nice to meet you, Suzy-chan."

<b>

One girl was still trying to catch up with the situation.

<b>

<b>

"What’s going on? You all seem to be having a lot of fun, huh?!"

<b>

Suzy turned around at the voice from behind and saw a tall girl standing there.

<b>

She was only slightly shorter than Mia, but her confident demeanor made her appear larger.

Her long brunette hair, tied back, shimmered cherry red in the light, and her cat-like eyes sparkled like aquamarine.

<b>

"I just finished introducing myself! Suzy, let me introduce you! This tall one is Dana, and the small one is Colin. They're both a year older than us!"

"Ha ha! 'On the side' is quite a statement! I'm Dana McCain. So you're the rumored girl... I'm glad to meet you! Looking forward to it from now on!!"

"Calling me 'small' is rude. I don't look that different from Bea... Sorry for being so loud! I'm Colin Saunders. Nice to meet you, Suzy."

"Suzy Cloud... nice to meet you... please take care of me..."

<b>

Behind Dana, there was another girl.

Colin, who introduced herself, was not much shorter than Beatrice.

She had dirty blonde hair tied back in a fishbone braid, giving her an elegant appearance.

Her large round glasses framed soft grayish-blue eyes that gently surveyed everyone.

<b>

Wow, they look like cat-eyed and tangerine-eyed older sisters, Suzy thought to herself.

<b>

"Uh, rumor... what?"

"That's right, it's a rumor. The legendary beautiful girl appears! ...and so on!!"

"Bufoh!"

<b>

Suzy burst out laughing.

<b>

"Su... super? ...Huh?"

<b>

"Oh?!" Mia and Colin exclaimed.

<b>

"In this village, the strong are very welcome! And if they're this cute, even more so!!"

<b>

Suddenly, I was pulled in, and my cheeks were rubbed against theirs.

<b>

"Ah! Dana, that's unfair! Me too, me too!"

"Fubueh!?"

<b>

On the other side, Colin was pressed against my cheek, and I was sandwiched between the two, causing me to make strange sounds.

"You're like a doll!" Colin exclaimed, while Dana shouted, "Wow! You're so soft like a baby!"

Mia seemed to hesitate, wondering whether to join or step back.

It seemed she wanted to join the hug.

<b>

Seeing this, Beatrice sighed, "Oh dear."

<b>

"Wow! You even smell cute! Hehe! Carla will be so jealous!!"

"Carla is a senior, one year older than Dana and the others! There are two more, Jessica and Alicia! All three will graduate next week, so they won't be coming around much anymore!"

<b>

Beatrice explained, but Suzy was too overwhelmed to focus.

<b>

<b>

I was being hugged by the two, and before I knew it, Mia had joined from behind, making it a chaotic situation.

Unintentionally, both upperclassmen had more prominent chests than Suzy.

My arms and back were engulfed in waves of soft flesh.

<b>

It felt like a small boat being tossed around in turbulent waves.

<b>

(What in the world is this situation?! Is this heaven?! My back! My arms! I'm enveloped in a blissful sensation!!

I'm so glad to be alive! Ahhhhhhhhhh!)

<b>

"Ah! Huh...! Hah!"

<b>

There was Suzy, spinning around and getting dizzy.

<b>

<b>

"It seems like things are getting lively!"

<b>

As the younger kids watched from a distance, Beatrice muttered in exasperation.

<b>

Then, someone else appeared, adding to the chaos.

<b>

"Ahhhhhhhhhh?! Is that Suzy?! Why?! Why are you in the classroom?! Eeeeeh?!"

<b>

As soon as he burst into the classroom, he shouted loudly and began to cause a commotion.

<b>

"Uh... huh? ...Arvin? ...Hello?"

"What’s going on, Suzy?! Why are you here?! Oh! Could it be that Suzy is going to school too? We'll be together from now on?! Yayyyyyyyyyyy!!!!"

<b>

Arvin approached Suzy as if he were about to hug her, but Beatrice quickly stepped in his way.

<b>

"Wait a minute! Arvin, what’s going on?! How do you know this girl?!"

"Uh! Bibi?! W-well, it doesn't matter!"

<b>

Beatrice frowned, furrowing her brow.

<b>

"You met her when you were out collecting two-headed boars in the forest, right? Fred said you were slacking off and drooling over her!"

"I-I wasn't drooling!!"

"Hmm... I see! ...So Arvin is quick on the draw, huh? ...I see, I see!!"

"N-no! Bibi! That's not it!!"

<b>

Was I drooling? Suzy tilted her head in confusion...

<b>

"…Fred?"

<b>

Who is that? I asked Dana.

<b>

"Fred McCain. He was out collecting boars with Arvin the other day, but you don't remember him? He has the same hair and eye color as me..."

<b>

Hmm? Was there someone like that?? Suzy tilted her head again, thinking.

<b>

"Ah... Fred, my condolences..."

<b>

Dana shook her head sadly.

<b>

<b>

Amidst the chaos, another boy approached Suzy.

<b>

He was much shorter than Suzy, with curly red-brown hair, a freckled face, and wearing denim overalls with his shirt sleeves rolled up carelessly.

<b>

Wow! He looked like a mischievous little rascal.

<b>

As Suzy half-admired him, he looked up at her with sparkling blue eyes full of curiosity.

<b>

When he got right in front of Suzy, he suddenly lifted her skirt without any preamble.

<b>

The fabric of the lifted skirt spread wide.

The light blue silk string panties that had just been put on that day were fully exposed to everyone.

<b>

For a moment, time seemed to stop.

<b>

The surrounding girls widened their eyes in shock, and the nearby boys erupted in cheers.

<b>

"Ugh! That little brat, Stefan!! Tch! Wait!!!"

<b>

The first to react was Dana, but before she could catch him, the boy called Stefan had already escaped like the wind.

<b>

"Well done, Stefan!!!"

"Arvin?!!!"

"Hey! Boys!? That's not something to stare at, you know?!"

"Whoa! ...she just got... her skirt... lifted... for the first time!"

"Oh... Suzy-chan? I think that's not the part to admire, but to get angry about?"

<b>

The entropy in the classroom increased even further.

<b>

----------------

Finally... finally! The role of the comic relief has been introduced!! ...It took a long time (+_+)
