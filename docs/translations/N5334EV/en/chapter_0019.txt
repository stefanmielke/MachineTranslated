# Chapter 19: Suzy Cloud's First Day at School

Alright! From here on, the characters will increase rapidly! (LOL)

----------------

<b>

"Suzy, do you have any interest in attending school?"

<b>

It was two days after I became Suzy Cloud that Henry asked me this.

<b>

It was sudden, and I happened to be enjoying a raspberry tart at the time, so it was a bit embarrassing, but I tilted my head slightly with a fork still in my mouth.

<b>

"The term will end in about two weeks, but..."

"Hmm, I was considering school eventually... but is it really okay to go this term?"

"Yes, after this term, there will be a long vacation, and the new school year starts in two months. I think it would be better for you to spend those two months with friends of the same age rather than alone," I suggested.

"Indeed! That's absolutely right! Let's get ready right away! Henry, can you handle the paperwork?"

"Leave it to me. I've already discussed this with Daisy. In fact, it was her idea to go to school this term."

<b>

I asked, "Who is Daisy?"

<b>

"Daisy is my wife who made this tart, and she is also a teacher at the school in Amukam village," he explained.

<b>

Oh! Now that you mention it, you said Daisy made the cherry pie the other day too!

A teacher who is good at baking is quite wonderful!!

<b>

But it feels like the developments are happening too suddenly... right?

<b>

"Is Suzy against going to school?"

"No... I... want to... try... but... I'm a little... worried?"

<b>

Isn't it difficult for an unknown person whose origins are unclear to suddenly blend into a school? Normally, people would be cautious, right?

When I conveyed such thoughts, Howard said, "That's not the case! In Amukam village, there is a trend of valuing the strong, and with my endorsement and the fact that you have defeated a wolf, the villagers will accept you without any issues..."

<b>

What is that? A sports-oriented village? That's a bit off-putting.

<b>

Well, that’s why there shouldn’t be any problems, and it was quickly decided that I would start attending school from the beginning of the week.

<b>

...I thought about it, but once my dad Howard decides on something, his subsequent actions are incredibly swift.

He quickly organizes everything and moves things along rapidly.

<b>

Is this what they call a business-minded personality? Well, with a president like this, everyone can feel secure following him!

Hehe, I felt a bit proud.

<b>

<b>

When I returned home and told them about school, it seemed that something in Sonia switched on.

She was unusually excited? W-What’s with all this extra energy?

The next day, Sonia and I went to town together to gather various things for me.

<b>

Since the first impression is important, Sonia said we must properly prepare the equipment! 

Equipment? Is there going to be... combat?! This is a school, right?!

<b>

<b>

At this point, I learned for the first time that Sonia originally had weak legs, and while she had no problem moving around the house, she couldn't stand for long periods or walk long distances.

She mentioned that when going on long trips, she also uses a wheelchair besides a carriage.

<b>

Even at home, if she carries something heavy, it puts a strain on her legs, so she leaves the heavy work to Elrose.

<b>

This means! I must properly support Sonia! Physically! Mentally!!

<b>

On the way to town, Sonia drove the carriage.

I was further impressed to see that she could do something like this... she is not just a refined lady.

<b>

But to reduce Sonia's burden, I need to learn how to drive the carriage too! I etched that in my heart.

<b>

During the journey, it was just the two of us, and we were unusually high-spirited, chatting about various things.

<b>

But it was a secret that most of the conversation was about food!

We also promised to gradually teach each other cooking.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The road to the town... to Coop Town was packed with red soil, and the contrast with the transparent green of the surrounding grass and trees was easy on the eyes.

The gently sprawling wheat fields and the clusters of trees peeking out here and there.

Though not as high as the Dipaara, the peaks of the pale purple mountains visible in the distance to the south.

Such scenery was delighting my eyes from atop the carriage.

<b>

The sky was a dazzling deep sky blue, with low, fluffy white clouds drifting in the wind.

<b>

Holding down my hat against the wind and taking a deep breath, the scents of wheat, greenery, and sky filled my chest, making me feel very good.

<b>

Sonia was watching me with affectionate eyes.

<b>

When our eyes met, I felt embarrassed, but for some reason, it made me very happy.

<b>

We used the carriage to get to town, but we walked to the shops, so I held Sonia's hand the whole time.

<b>

"You don't need to worry so much, it's fine!" she said with a smile... but I'm worried! I won't let go of your hand!!

<b>

At the shop, a fashion show took place!

Audience: Sonia. Model: Suzy Cloud.

<b>

In short, it was like a dress-up doll? I was dressed in various outfits as Sonia picked them out... 

<b>

There were also hats, shoes, new baskets, stationery, and finally, underwear.

<b>

Underwear was a bit of a high hurdle and embarrassing, but Sonia was in high spirits, choosing a wide range from cute to slightly adult-like.

But I thought, isn’t a silk thong a bit much for a 13-year-old?...

<b>

The unseen aspects of a woman's grooming are what truly matter! she said seriously, leaving me speechless.

<b>

After finishing all the shopping, we had the shop staff carry the bags to the carriage... and a mountain was formed in the back.

We exchanged glances and burst into laughter.

<b>

"We need to make sure Howard helps out too," Sonia said with a dazzling smile.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The morning of the day I was to go to school was hectic.

Well, actually, it had been hectic since the day before when we were choosing what to wear... What should I wear? Sonia and Elrose were debating fiercely...

<b>

In the end, I decided to wear a pinafore.

Well, it's an apron dress, I suppose.

Not a jumper skirt.

It has big frills on the shoulders like wings, and the bow at the back is also large.

<b>

The dress worn under the apron is apple green.

This one also has many pleats in the skirt, making it voluminous.

The frills at the hem are large, and the collar is big with frills too.

The sleeves are long and puffy.

<b>

On my feet are ruby red lace-up boots that match my hair.

They have rounded toes and thick soles.

They are tightened with black laces from the instep to the toe.

<b>

My hair is styled in pigtails, with a zigzag parting at the back, tied on both sides.

The ties are vivid blue hair ribbons, making big bows.

...Isn't this a bit too cute overall!?

<b>

I feel like a princess from somewhere, right?

When I jokingly said this to Sonia, she replied with a serious face, "Oh? Suzy is a princess, you know?"

<b>

What am I supposed to do about that!?

I could die from embarrassment!!

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

The school is located about 5 kilometers in a straight line from the Cloud residence.

<b>

It was a church-like building surrounded by a windbreak of evergreen trees, with white walls and a blue gabled roof.

I could see a bell hanging from the tower extending from the building.

<b>

Since it was my first day, I took the carriage driven by Howard to school.

<b>

Inside the school office, I was welcomed by Mrs. Jameson, also known as Daisy Jameson.

<b>

She appeared to be in her mid-30s.

Her dark brown hair was braided and gathered into a bun at the back.

Her hair was very glossy, neatly arranged without any stray hairs.

She had grayish-brown eyes that exuded intelligence, and she wore small glasses.

Her friendly smile left a strong impression.

<b>

Ah, she seems like a capable office worker. Moreover, she looks like she has a responsible position! was Suzy's inner voice.

<b>

Her attire was a loose white blouse, with a cool-toned, calm-patterned scarf wrapped like a tie, giving an overall clean appearance.

The knee-length tight skirt and black stockings were very much in line with a female teacher's style.

<b>

<b>

For a moment, Suzy was led by Daisy to the classroom.

However, as Daisy had paperwork to handle with Howard, she called over a girl who was in the classroom and entrusted Suzy to her before returning to the office.

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I'm Beatrice Croki! I've heard about you from my father!"

<b>

The girl had wavy, chestnut-colored hair that reached her back, held back with a headband, revealing her broad forehead.

Her slender, well-defined eyebrows and large amber eyes, which sometimes appeared golden in the light, reflected her intelligence.

The mischievous smirk on her lips and the freckles scattered across her face seemed to express her strong-willed nature.

<b>

She was slightly shorter than Suzy.

Her gaze was a bit lower.

This was the first time I met someone shorter than me since coming here. I felt a bit happy.

<b>

"...I'm Suzy Cloud... nice to meet you!"

"Nice to meet you! You can call me Bea or Tris, whichever you like!"

"...Then... Bea-chan?"

"Wait a minute! Why? I don't really get it, but... I don't like that sound very much!"

"...Hmm... then... Bea-yan?"

"Huh? No... no! What is it? It sounds even worse than the previous one! I don't really understand, but!!"

"...Muu?"

"Y-Yeah! Well, it's fine! For now, let's get along! Oh, let me introduce this girl too! Mia!"

"Oh, um, I'm Mia Mathison. Nice to meet you."

"...........Huh? ...Ah... I'm Suzy... Cloud... ...yes? ...yes... ...yes."

"......Huh? Uh... what?"

<b>

Introduced by Beatrice, the girl named Mia appeared to be quite a bit taller than Suzy.

She seemed to be around 160 centimeters tall.

<b>

Her hair was a slightly bluish ash blonde, with bangs naturally flowing at eyebrow height.

Her long hair, which reached her waist, was loosely braided and fell over her right shoulder.

Her ultra-marine blue eyes, like a gathering of blue, were very gentle and gave a sense of reassurance.

And.........

<b>

"We're all the same age!"

<b>

W-What?! Suzy's eyes widened as she turned to Beatrice.

That's right! Beatrice said, placing her hands on her hips and raising an eyebrow.

<b>

Suzy looked back at Mia.

Her gaze traveled down to her neck...

And there, proudly sat her voluptuous figure!!

<b>

"Ugh!!"

<b>

I couldn't help but let out a groan.

<b>

"Huh? What? Huh?"

<b>

Mia looked puzzled, while Beatrice shook her head in exasperation.

<b>

(What in the world is this situation?! Is this heaven?! My back! My arms! I'm enveloped in a blissful sensation!!

I'm so glad to be alive! Ahhhhhhhhhh!!!)

<b>

"Ah! Huh...! Huh?!"

<b>

There was Suzy, being tossed around and becoming dizzy.

<b>

"Things are getting quite lively, aren't they?"

<b>

As the younger children watched from a distance, Beatrice muttered in exasperation.

<b>

And then, someone else appeared, adding to the commotion.

<b>

"Ahhhhhhhhhhh??!!! Is that you, Suzy?! What are you doing here?! Huh?! Why are you in the classroom?!"

<b>

As soon as he burst into the classroom, he shouted loudly.

<b>

"Ah... Huh? ...Arvin? ...Hello?"

"What’s going on, Suzy?! Why are you here?! Oh! Could it be that you're going to school too? We'll be together from now on?! Yayyyyyyyyyyy!!!!"

<b>

Arvin approached Suzy as if he were about to hug her, but Beatrice quickly stepped in to block his path.

<b>

"Wait a minute! Arvin, what’s going on?! How do you know this girl?!"

"U! Bibi?! I-I don't know! It doesn't matter, does it?!"

<b>

Beatrice frowned, narrowing her eyes.

<b>

"You met her when you were out collecting two-headed boars in the forest, right? Fred said you were slack-jawed and drooling!"

"No! I wasn't drooling!!"

"Oh, really? So, Arvin, you really are quick on the uptake, huh? ...Oh, I see!!"

"I-I’m not! Bibi! That's not what I meant!!"

<b>

Drooling? Was I? Suzy tilted her head in confusion...

<b>

"...Fred?"

<b>

Who is that? she asked Beatrice.

<b>

"Fred McKein. He was out collecting boars with Arvin the other day, don't you remember? He has the same hair and eye color as me..."

<b>

Hmm? Was there such a person?? Suzy tilted her head again, thinking.

<b>

"Ah... Fred, my condolences..."

<b>

Beatrice shook her head sadly.

<b>

<b>

Amidst this chaos, another boy approached Suzy.

<b>

He was much shorter than Suzy, with curly red-brown hair, a freckled face, and denim overalls with the sleeves of his shirt rolled up carelessly.

<b>

Oh! He looked just like a mischievous little boy.

<b>

As Suzy half-admiringly watched him, he opened his big blue eyes with curiosity and looked up at her.

<b>

When he reached Suzy, he suddenly lifted her skirt without any preamble.

<b>

The fabric of the lifted skirt flared out widely.

The thin light blue silk thong that had just been put on that day was fully exposed to everyone.

<b>

For a moment, time seemed to stop.

<b>

The surrounding girls widened their eyes in shock, and the nearby boys erupted in cheers of joy.

<b>

"Ugh! That little brat, Stefan!! Damn it! Wait!!!"

<b>

The first to react was Beatrice, but before she could catch him, the boy called Stefan fled like the wind.

<b>

"Well done, Stefan!!!"

"Arvin?!!!"

"Hey! Boys!? That's not something to stare at?!"

"Whoa! ...I just got... my skirt... lifted... for the first time!"

"Ah... Suzy-chan? I think that's not the part to admire, but to get angry about?"

<b>

The entropy in the classroom increased even further.

<b>

Finally... finally! The comic relief character has made an appearance!! ...It took a long time (+_+)
