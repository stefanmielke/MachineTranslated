# 193 The Hot Springs Resort and the Doctors

The sky is a clear sky blue with streaky clouds flowing through it like a vigorous paintbrush.

Against this backdrop, a series of yellowish-orange roofs stand in a row between the rising white steam.

Is it the quality of the stone of the land that the stone walls of the buildings are mostly dark brown or reddish-brown? Or is it the effect of the hot spring ingredients?

Even so, the colors of the cityscape are very soothing, and even nostalgic, creating a gentle atmosphere.

<blank>

The streets are not flat, but have steps here and there, which tells us that this is a town built on an undulating terrain.

He said that three years ago, during the disaster, they were on the verge of destruction, but now he doesn't feel a whiff of that.

<blank>

The scenery of the town is very serene and makes one feel that it is the result of the hard work of Miss Cordilia's father, the head of Boltsunan, Mr. Bona Raven Casper, and the residents, although it is probably due to magical technology.

<blank>

Yes, very calm.

You say it's calm. ......

<blank>

Good luck, Mr. Morris! Good luck with that!

"Hmmm, we'll take care of this one, no problem."

"Senseiーー! Please don't give Mr. Cloud any trouble!

I know what I'm talking about! You know what I'm talking about! What do you want me to do, Mr. Nosori and Mr. Seiwashi? You're just going to relax and enjoy the hot-spring cure, aren't you?

Of course, I'm not going to leave the spa for a week! I'm not going to get out of the hot springs for a week!"

"Well, Joseline, you'll be leading the students, so I hope you'll do well.

What? Eeeeeeeee? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee?!"

<blank>

And yet, the teachers are noisy.

It is noisy in every way. Especially Dr. Joseline is noisy.

Why is this assistant teacher acting like "I didn't hear you! Why is this assistant teacher saying things like "I didn't hear you!

<blank>

"You want the same treatment as us! You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.

Why is that? It's good, isn't it? I want to relax in a hot spring too!

"Joseline, you know you can't stay here because you're leading the students. You know that you cannot stay here because you are in charge of the students.

Oh no! Even Mr. Norman!

The guard is right! What are you talking about now?

'Hmmm, I'm sure they just want to come here and play and make a bad move anyway.'

<blank>

Dr. Joseline looks like "I'm desperate!" but as Norman said, she's here on business, right?

There is no way I can relax in a hot spring.

<blank>

Well..! It's almost time to leave!"

"Hahhhh! Ursula first!

Now..! I'm going to go Kirikiri!"

Kuhi-hi-hoa! Kuhihihi-uhi-ohooooo! Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-hi-ho-hoa!"

<blank>

Dr. Ursula, smiling, hooks her finger in Dr. Joseline's side entrance and pulls it out.

The doctor is relentless in what he does with his cheerful smile. ...... You're a wuss.

<blank>

<blank>

We are now in front of one of the most luxurious spa hotels in Magnumtor.

<blank>

Well, rather than an inn, this is by all accounts a luxury hotel in appearance!

The building is said to be one of the five oldest in the city. The massive stone structure, reminiscent of rounded Baroque architecture, was safe and sound during the recent disaster. Perhaps it was thanks to the careful magical treatment.

This story also gives us a good idea of the level of luxury of this hotel.

<blank>

I think Dr. Joseline was taken aback by the grandeur of the hotel, because as soon as she saw it, she froze with her eyes wide open.

I was supposed to have been escorted here by the teachers, but for some reason they wanted to go into the hotel with me!

<blank>

I feel no sympathy for that figure being dragged down by Dr. Ursula.

The reason why I am here is because I am accompanying Dr. Nosori and Mr. Seiwashi on their way to the hotel, and Dr. Morris.

<blank>

Yes, it is this Dr. Morris Baltasar whom I am escorting this time.

Dr. Morris was directly commissioned by the school president to investigate the mine in Munanotos, and I was assigned by the president to escort him.

<blank>

However, in this hot spring, only two people, Dr. Nosori and Dr. Seiwashi, except for Dr. Morris, enjoy the hot spring cure.

The two teachers and their escort, Mr. Norman, walk toward the hotel entrance, leaving Dr. Morris behind.

Oh, Mr. Norman turned to me once and said, "Dr. Morris, please! in a loud voice and then bowed his head deeply.

Yeah, he's still a sissy.

<blank>

Is it okay if I'm the only one who can't go to the hot springs?

Well, this is kind of a reward for the analytical work you two have done.

You weren't involved in the drug analysis, were you?

Yes, it's almost a two-man job.

I didn't know they could do drug analysis.

The original drug analysis was done by the university's alchemy department.

Was it, sir?"

They were able to analyze the drug itself, but were unable to analyze the vital biological fragment.

So you're going to bowl over the teachers?

That's what I mean! Well, I'm only providing a magic insulator."

<blank>

The doctor laughed and said, "It was a tag-team victory! He laughed.

<blank>

I'm going to take a long soak in the hot springs after I get back from my research!"

<blank>

When I listen to the teachers, I get the feeling that these teachers respect each other, even though they argue about what they are doing.

You are still very close.

<blank>

Then, while enjoying the hot springs, I'll see them off before their vacation is over! I can just picture the two of them leaving with frustrated looks on their faces! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

<blank>

Let's see, are we close ......?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The reconstruction of the city is almost complete with the use of earth attribute magic such as Earthwall! If you have the earth attribute, I think it will be a good learning experience for you to visit the site of land clearing in the city!"

<blank>

As I watched them disappear into the hotel with Dr. Morris, who was raising a high laugh, I heard Dr. Ursula raise her voice from the plaza behind me.

<blank>

Even so, there are still places at the foot of the mountain where fissure eruptions have occurred, and even now, toxic gases are occasionally detected in the sulfur spring known as "Rohan's Sigh"! However, the nature park is well protected by strong wards, so it is safe! So please be careful not to go outside the boundaries!

<blank>

The doctor is now talking about the damage and recovery that the city of Magnumtor suffered as a result of the volcanic activity that occurred three years ago in 2418.

Most of the area has been rebuilt and is safe now, but there are still some dangerous areas and people are advised to stay out of them.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to go. I'm going. Bibi will take care of the rest, Mia, okay?

<blank>

Under the teacher's command, I prepare to leave for the campsite as I see everyone else getting ready to leave.

<blank>

I'll take care of the Kochs," he said! ...... but you, too! You, too, be sure to keep your moderation!

I know, shhh?

<blank>

I don't know. I feel like Bibi's trust in me has gone down to the bottom of the barrel. I wish Mia wouldn't nod again and again with her arms crossed.

<blank>

"Sue, ....... Please take care of me."

I will serve you to the best of my ability.

<blank>

Karen turned to me with a serious look on her face and said.

The reopening of the mine in Munanotos is also Karen's wish. We hope to bring good results back to her.

<blank>

Ku, Kla. ....... Sue, Sue ...... and Ji-san ....... Take care ......."

<blank>

Oooh! Miss Cordilia called me by name!

For a while now, I've been saying, "You can call me 'Sue' just like Karen calls me," but she's been calling me by my family name for a long time, as if she was embarrassed. ......

I feel like you've made up your mind to come here? I've turned bright red, and it's so cool, right?

Then, so am I!

<blank>

Thank you Cody! Take care of Karen, okay?"

Ha ha hiiiii!"

<blank>

Oh! Boo-hoo! and then boiled and octopused some more!

Isn't he cute when he bites himself?

<blank>

BUGGOT!"

<blank>

Oops! Miss Catherine is vomiting blood behind me again!

And Bibi's eyes are still below freezing.
