# Chapter 193: The Hot Spring Town and the Scholars

The sky is a clear sky blue, with streaks of clouds flowing like brush strokes.

Against this backdrop, numerous yellowish-orange roofs are lined up, interspersed with rising white steam.

The stone walls of the buildings are predominantly dark brown and reddish-brown; is it due to the quality of the stone in this land? Or perhaps the influence of the hot spring minerals?

Even so, the color scheme of the town is very calming, and it creates a gentle atmosphere that can evoke a sense of nostalgia.

<b>

The streets are certainly not flat, with steps here and there, teaching us that this town was built in a hilly area.

During the disaster three years ago, it was said to have come close to devastation, but now there is not a trace of that feeling.

<b>

It must be thanks to magical technology, but it feels like a very peaceful town, a product of the hard work of Mr. Bōna Raven Kaspar, the head of this Boltsunan, who is the father of Lady Cordelia, and the residents.

<b>

Yes, it is very peaceful.

Even though it is peaceful...

<b>

"Well then, Morris-kun! Do your best!"

"Hmm, you can leave it to us without any worries."

"Teacherーーー! Please, please don'tーーー cause any trouble forーーー Mr. Cloudーーー!"

"I know, I know! You silly assistant! What do you mean by 'leave it to us'?! You two are just eager to enjoy the hot springs, aren't you?!!"

"Of course! I'm planning to stay in the hot springs for a week!"

"Hmm, I think Joseline-kun should do her best since she is in charge of the students."

"Eh?! Eeehーーー?! Eeeeeーーーーーーーーっっ!! Ueeeeeーーーー?!"

<b>

Yet, the teachers are noisy.

Anyway, they are noisy. Especially Joseline-sensei is loud.

Why has this assistant teacher become so much like "I didn't hear thatーー!!"?

<b>

"To wish for the same treatment as us! How utterly unaware of your own standing you are!"

"Why notーーーー! It's fineーーーー! I also want toーー relaxーー in the hot springsーー!"

"Joseline-san. You are in charge of the students, so you know you can't stay here."

"That'sーーー! Even Lord Normanーーー"

"Just like the guard said! What are you saying now?!"

"Hmm, you probably just want to play here and are making a futile struggle."

<b>

Joseline-sensei looks like she's "despairing!", but as Norman-san said, she is here for work, right?

There’s no way she can relax in the hot springs.

<b>

"Well then! It's almost time to depart!"

"Huhーー! Are you going ahead, Ashuraーーー?!"

"Alright! Let's hurry up!"

"Kuhihaーー! Kuhihihuhhoーー! Hihhararaireeーー!"

<b>

Ashura-sensei, smiling brightly, hooks her finger into Joseline-sensei's mouth and drags her along.

The teacher, with a cheerful smile, shows no mercy in what she does... How terrifying.

<b>

<b>

Right now, we are in front of one of the finest hot spring inns in Magnumtor City.

<b>

Well, rather than an inn, it looks more like a luxury hotel!

This place is said to be one of the top five long-established inns in the city, and the heavy stone building reminiscent of rounded Baroque architecture reportedly survived the recent disaster intact. It is likely due to the thorough magical treatment it received.

From that story, one can easily gauge the luxury of this hotel.

<b>

When Joseline-sensei saw the hotel, her eyes widened and she froze, so I think she was taken aback by its grandeur.

Even though she should have come this far with the teachers, for some reason, she tried to enter the hotel together!

<b>

I feel no sympathy for her being dragged along by Ashura-sensei.

And the reason I am here is that I am accompanying Mr. Nosori and Mr. Seiwashi, who are heading to the hotel, along with Mr. Morris.

<b>

Yes, this time I am tasked with protecting Mr. Morris Baltasar.

Mr. Morris was directly asked by the academy's director to investigate the Munanotos mine, and I took on the task of protecting him, also from the director.

<b>

However, it seems that at this hot spring, only Mr. Nosori and Mr. Seiwashi will enjoy the hot springs, excluding Mr. Morris.

The two teachers and their guard, Mr. Norman, walk towards the hotel entrance, leaving Mr. Morris behind.

Ah, Mr. Norman turned around once and said loudly, "Please take care of Mr. Morris!" before bowing deeply.

Yeah, he really is a reliable person.

<b>

"Is it alright that only the teacher can't enter the hot spring?"

"Well, this is more like a reward for the analysis work the two did."

"Did you not participate in the drug analysis, teacher?"

"That's right, it was mostly their achievement."

"I didn't know that you teachers could even handle drug analysis."

"The original drug analysis was done by the university's alchemy department."

"Is that so?"

"Those guys could analyze the drug itself, but they were at a loss when it came to the crucial biological samples."

"And that's why it fell to the teachers?"

"That's how it is! Well, I only provided the magical insulator."

<b>

The teacher laughed heartily, saying, "It's a victory for the two's tag team!"

<b>

"I'll take my time soaking in the hot springs after I return from the investigation!"

<b>

Listening to the teacher's story, despite the bickering, I feel that these teachers respect each other.

They really do get along well.

<b>

"And then, while enjoying the hot springs, I'll see off the two whose vacation ends first! I can already picture the two of them leaving with regretful faces! Dahaha!"

<b>

Um, are they really that close...?

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Thanks to earth attribute magic like Earth Wall, the recovery is almost complete now! I think it would be a good learning experience for those with earth attributes to observe the leveling work around the town!"

<b>

As I watch Mr. Morris laughing heartily and disappearing into the hotel with the two, I hear Ashura-sensei's voice coming from the square behind us.

<b>

"However, there are still places at the foot of the mountain where fissure eruptions are occurring, and at the sulfur spring known as 'Rohan's Sigh,' toxic gas is still occasionally detected! However, the national park is well protected by a strong barrier, so it is safe! So please be careful not to go outside the barrier!"

<b>

The teacher is currently talking about the damage and recovery situation of Magnumtor City caused by the volcanic activity that occurred three years ago in 2418.

Now, most of the recovery is complete and it is safe, but there are still dangerous areas in some places, so it is a warning not to enter them.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Well then, I'm off. Please take care of the rest, Vivi and Mia!"

<b>

Under the teacher's command, I prepare to depart for the campsite while watching everyone start their preparations.

<b>

"Leave this to me! ...More importantly, you! Make sure to maintain your decorum!!"

"I-I understand, okay?!"

<b>

What is it? I feel like Vivi's trust in me has dropped to a terrible low. I wish Mia would stop nodding repeatedly with her arms crossed.

<b>

"Su-chan... Please take care of yourself."

"I will do my best."

<b>

Karen faced me with a serious expression and spoke.

The reopening of the Munanotos mine is also Karen's wish. I want to bring back good results.

<b>

"Cl-Claud... Su... Suu... Please... be careful."

<b>

Whoa! Lady Cordelia just called me by my name!

Not long ago, I had said, "You can call me 'Suu' just like Karen does," but for some reason, she had always called me by my family name... 

Did she finally muster the courage to do it? She's blushing and looking incredibly cute?!

Then, I will too!

<b>

"Thank you, Cordelia! Please take care of Karen!"

"Y-Yes!"

<b>

Oh! Wow! She’s even more flustered now!

The way she stumbles over her words is cute too!

<b>

"Bu-goh!"

<b>

Oops! Lady Catherine is spitting blood again behind me!

And Vivi's gaze is still icy.
