# 71 Vampires at Dawn Part 1

Thank you very much for your patience.

This is a long story, so I'm going to split it into two stories.

<blank>

I'm working hard on "No.2" (@_@@;)


----------------

<blank>

"............ is coming!"

<blank>

Cornel Wallich, the solid leader, uttered a few short words, shield held up in front of him, and then he sat back and prepared for the coming impact.

<blank>

The solidarity of the team blocked the hordes of undead that surged through the gaps in the walls like a mountain tsunami.

The earth and atmosphere resound with an impact as if hit by a huge hammer, and the "Full Phalanx" catches it.

<blank>

It's a shock that I will continue to take repeatedly for over an hour now.

The things overflowing from the phalanx continue to be slaughtered as much as possible by those who are responsible for the attack, but there is no sign of any interruption at all.

<blank>

Outside the phalanx, in the front, five men, three from AMCAM, Kyle Irvine, the second-in-command, and Tony Easton, the leader of Team 3, continued to slaughter the avalanche of undead as if they were reaping the benefits of their actions.

<blank>

The occasional large or special type of undead is also defeated, just like the rest of the rabble.

For the three Amcam members, whether it's just a skeleton or a disaster class that could destroy an entire city with a single skeleton, it probably makes no difference. ......, Cornell thought as he watched Conrad blow away the Great Skull with a single swing of his axe from behind. I'm not sure what to do with it, but I'm sure it's a disaster class that could destroy a city.

<blank>

The undead that Cornell and his team are now receiving with their phalanxes are not an unusual number, even though they are being taken down by the vanguard of Howard and his team.

Currently, there are only three firms, including Cornell, that deploy full phalanxes.

Half of them, three of them, were disabled in the recent vampire attack. Although they survived, they are in no condition to participate in the battle.

<blank>

The walls surrounding the defensive positions built by the logistics forces were also destroyed by the attack, and large holes were drilled in them.

The Knights retreated from the debris and re-barricaded themselves.

The wall itself is still alive with the effects of the "sacrament" that the priests have applied to it.

The undead do not want to touch it.

<blank>

The same is true for the silvery-white wall that largely surrounds the "Black Rock".

The undead are avoiding the wall that is the "sanctified object" and are overflowing through a large hole in it.

<blank>

Thanks to this, the unit is barely holding on by being vigilant only at the exits.

This would have been out of control if the attack had come from all directions.

In the event of a melee, those who could not move would be the ones who would be defeated.

<blank>

The undead rush toward the "hole" in the camp's wall, which is blocked by the three soliders.

Cornell, the center of the three, was boosting the power of the "Full Phalanx" by increasing the magical power contained in the phalanx and boosting it.

With a shout, they catch and push back the white muddy water that rushes in.

Immediately after the "Full Phalanx" converged, Zushiri and Cornell felt a weight stretch over their bodies.

Due to the continuous supply of excessive magic power to the phalanx, the heavy-mobility magic armor's magical power storage device ran out, and Cornell's own magic power was directly allocated to maintain the activation of the magic armor.

<blank>

At that moment, there was someone running toward Cornell and the others from behind, keeping low and alert.

It was from the logistics unit, carrying a large backpack on its shoulder.

Seeing an opening in the battle, the logistics team member who had taken up position directly behind Cornell quickly removed the large box attached to Cornell's waist with a practiced hand and pulled out its contents.

He took out an object of the same shape as the one he had removed from his backpack and inserted it in the same way in the place where he had removed it.

He then put back the box he had removed and immediately left Cornell's back.

<blank>

This is the last of the fully charged magical storage devices. Please bear with me!"

<blank>

The logistics men called out to Cornell and immediately went over to the other two soliders to replace the batteries as well.

<blank>

In a couple of hours, it will be dawn! We'll make it through until then!"

<blank>

Cornell shouts and the full phalanx catches the wave of immortals like a muddy stream.

<blank>

The time was already well past 3:00 a.m. The sun should begin to rise before 6:00.

In fact, it would be another two and a half hours before dawn.

When morning comes, undead activity will be limited.

Even low-level objects will disappear in the morning sun, and even high-level objects will not be left alone.

<blank>

Behind him, Cedric's voice was flying, inspiring the members of the group. Even now, he is probably evacuating the wounded while slaughtering the spilled out enemies himself.

<blank>

This is where we have to step up to the plate.

Cornell removed the loaded magazine of the magic storage casing from his hip pouch, replaced it with the emptied one attached to the tower sild, and sat back down again.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The major difference between the "magic armor" used by Howard and others from Amkam and the "heavy mobile magic armor" equipped by their knights is its versatility.

<blank>

The "magical armor" used by Amkamu's people changes its performance greatly depending on the user's magical power value.

In addition, items that have been adjusted and created to match the user's magical power are those that further dramatically increase the ability of the wearer.

Purely the ability of the individual user determines the combat value. That is the "Magic Armor" of AMCAM.

<blank>

On the other hand, the "Heavy Mobile Magic Armor" used by the Knights can hit a high level of combat value regardless of the ability of the equipped person.

The reason for this is that the magic value supplied to the equipment can be strengthened by using a magical power storage device.

This enabled the equipped person to play a certain combat value above a certain level, regardless of the person's magical value.

If the magic power supplied by this magic storage device is added to the magic power of the wearer, further enhancement can be hoped for.

However, this will require the equipped person to have the ability to control the magic power accordingly. ......

<blank>

In addition, by using the various cartridges in the "magic manifestation device" installed in each piece of equipment, the wearer can activate magic such as reinforcement, assistance, attack, and recovery without consuming his or her own magic power, regardless of the magic attribute of the equipped person.

This allows them to use more situational cartridges to gain an edge in the battle.

<blank>

The high combat value that could not be reached without a high level of physical ability and advanced magic control skills.

The stability that allows all wearers to produce its high combat value. And the option to use different cartridges for different magic depending on the situation.

This versatility is the most important characteristic of "heavy mobile magic armor.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Now again, Cornell's huge frame stomped on the ground, pushing back the rough waves of immortals that were lapping at us.

The "Magic Accumulation Chassis," which has used up its "Phalanx," flies out of the tower silo in a cloud of white smoke.

<blank>

At that moment, Cornell caught a glimpse of something shining beyond the hordes of undead that were rushing in front of him.

Cornell's intuition instantly alerts him.

Immediately, he fully opened the pathway of the newly loaded storage device and dropped magic power into the activated "Full Phalanx" at once.

The next moment, with an explosion-like vibration, a torrent of intense flames engulfed Cornell and the surrounding undead.

<blank>

The skin burns and the hair burns. In the high heat that deprived us of oxygen, we could not even breathe. Even if I had breathed in, my lungs would have been burned in no time.

Even with the "Full Phalanx" activated at high output, this much heat would have been generated. What would have happened if there had been even the slightest delay in response?

Cornell clenched his back teeth and felt the hairs on his back stand on end under the pressure of the blast flame.

<blank>

The flames that had roared and licked the area subsided, and Cornell yukked his eyes open.

The surrounding area was extensively burned, and the few bushes and grasses that had grown on the ground surface had burned away, exposing a black rocky terrain.

Trees within the blast range were not allowed to burn and came crashing down, charred in the process.

<blank>

The barricades surrounding the defensive position were all burned down, and the surrounding walls were charred to their mid-thickness. It is unlikely that the walls can be expected to be as strong as before.

<blank>

Most of the undead that covered the area have been reduced to ashes, and those that can still move even though they have lost parts of their bodies are struggling and turning their vindictiveness toward the living.

<blank>

And Howard and his team, who were wielding swords in front of Cornell and his team, can be found at .......

It certainly stood there in the burnt wasteland.

<blank>

Conrad stomps the earth with both feet.

He was holding a huge battle-axe protruding forward like a shield with both hands, and white smoke was billowing from his body.

Howard and Gilbert put their hands on Conrad's back from both sides as if to support him.

Behind them, Kyle was down on one knee, his two-handed sword clutched in both hands, and Tony was holding his knight's sword with one hand and his kite shield with the other hand to guard himself against the blast.

<blank>

<blank>

Axfort."

It is a defensive technique similar to the "phalanx" of Cornell and his knights.

The raised battle-axe is filled with magic power and serves as a shield for party members as a magic shield with high resistance to physical and magic.

Howard and Gilbert were supporting Conrad's technique by boosting his performance by putting their palms on his back and pouring magic power into him.

The three of them quickly formed this formation and survived the blast.

<blank>

The reason why the heat on Cornell and the rest of the solid force was reduced and did not affect those in the rear of the unit was because they were greatly reduced in strength here.

<blank>

<blank>

"Oh, no? You're going to survive all this, aren't you?"

<blank>

A startled woman's voice was heard in the forest, which had been quiet except for the sound of crackling and exploding fire.

<blank>

I apologize for the long wait. It's ......, but it looks like the party room is warming up enough, right?"

<blank>

As if she had decided on a funny joke, a woman in a black nightdress ...... named Electra appeared from the depths of the forest, beyond the collapsed wall, as if she were emerging from the darkness.

<blank>

"Did you try to burn us down with all your men? ....... You are very bold, aren't you, to use up so many of them? Vampires!

Oh?" Didn't you like the view?"

<blank>

Howard glared at her, and Electra tilted her head and laughed even funnier.

<blank>

I'm not going to let you do this to me. ......!

<blank>

Conrad smiles ferociously, and a vein of chirpiness appears on his forehead.

But Howard did not pause and immediately moved on.

Moving as if sliding on the ground, he caught Elektra in time for the Grand Divider and reaped her horizontally with the blade held to his left.

<blank>

But the blade sparks with a fierce sound.

<blank>

"......!"

"Ugggghh ......! Nu!!!!"

<blank>

Howard's sword line was blocked by a huge machete-like sword held by a brown-skinned woman who suddenly appeared as if blurring out of the darkness. In that brief moment, she sent Elektra fleeing backward.

The brown woman ...... Joel caught Howard's sword rage with a grunt.

<blank>

At that moment, Conrad raised his huge battle-axe above his head and swung it vigorously sideways, calmly, toward the earth.

One flash, two flashes, three flashes. One after another, they tore through the earth, carving deep claw-like cracks in the earth one after another.

Then, through the cracks, several droplets of blood sprayed up, as if the earth had been wounded.

<blank>

At the same time, Gilberto ran into the woods.

As it is, it faces the darkness from a low position and runs a light green sword flash sharply.

<blank>

Tsk!"

<blank>

From there, too, a pale blue-skinned woman ...... Marina appeared to seep out of the darkness in which she had been lurking, her body blurring as she avoided Gilbert's sword flash, moving further backward in an instant.

<blank>

"You want to draw attention with a big-ass firework and then use the opportunity to get the chains into the ground and target the people in the back? And the black hair is a guard and a diversion? It doesn't matter as long as they know what they're doing! Don't think you can pull off the same trick over and over again! You're a lickspittle!

<blank>

Conrad barked up at the women.

<blank>

"......fun"

<blank>

Elektra kept her hand over her mouth and gave a small sniff.

<blank>

So how can I help you, ......?"

<blank>

Three women stood in a row, leaning against each other.

Electra tells Howard and the others as she languidly brushes her hair back over her ears.

<blank>

"The situation hasn't changed one iota at ......, has it?"

'...... enough already, Elektra. I wanted to see the funny looks on these guys' faces when they hung up their prey again. ...... Oh well, I can't help it."

<blank>

Marina, leaning with her left hand on Elektra's shoulder, puts her right index finger to her mouth and raises her eyebrows in disappointment.

The three women huddle together and giggle.

<blank>

"............"

Fuck you, ......!"

<blank>

Howard and Conrad gritted their back teeth at the sight of these women.

<blank>

It's a party, so let's make sure we're in good company, shall we?"

Oh?" I'm finally allowed to play for real? Yes!"

Oh, Joel? Don't be too hard on yourself, okay?"

<blank>

Elektra stepped forward and made a theatrical move, fluttering her palms in front of her bosom, which was just spilling out from her own wide V-shaped dress.

Then a small leather bag appeared, large enough to fit in his hand.

Elektra smiles, as if to say that the show magic has succeeded, puts her hands on her hips and raises the bag to her chest to show it off.

He then put his hand inside the leather bag he had taken out and grabbed something out of the jalousie.

It is the fang of something sharply pointed, about two to three centimeters in size.

Electra grabbed a handful of fangs out of her pouch and scattered them among the girls and Howard and the others as if they were sowing seeds.

<blank>

Come on, everyone! The party is back on! Tonight, let's dance till morning!

<blank>

Elektra spread her arms out in a grandiose gesture and raised her voice in a high, sing-song-like manner, and the ground where the fangs were scattered rose and fell.

From there, one after another, knights of skulls crawled out wearing stout equipment.

<blank>

Cadmus Night."

A higher body of skull warriors said to be born from the fangs of a dragon.

Its threat value is "55". This is comparable to the Jodan rank.

<blank>

That's Walla Walla and more than two dozen of them.

In no time at all, they emerged from the ground and began running to avoid Howard and the others at once, heading for the expeditionary force in their rear.

<blank>

What the hell?

"Nuh! You're going after the weakest!

I must ask you to refrain from being a wallflower! Everyone is the star of the show tonight! I'm done playing with the masses! These people will not bore you to death!

<blank>

Elektra says that "Kadmos Night" is different from the undead that we have seen so far.

Immediately, Howard and his team shined the magic mark on their leather armor and crushed the skull warriors who tried to pass through the side with their hard armor, but were suddenly blocked by a black wall rising up from under their feet.

<blank>

Shit! Not these guys again!

<blank>

Conrad exclaimed evasively.

It was the three large black undead that we had seen earlier. It once again blocked the way of Howard and his friends.

<blank>

You can play with us a little longer.

<blank>

Marina tells Howard and the others as she stands atop a giant black skull, yipping and swaying her chains in the sky.

Howard, Conrad, Gilbert, and five others, including Kyle and Tony, were split off from the main group and isolated on the front lines.

<blank>

Chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! Tony! Kyle! Stay strong! Stay with me!

<blank>

Conrad shouted as he caught the rush of the black behemoth with his battle axe.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Raisa!

<blank>

Magritte Gauche, who had just nipped a Kadmos Knight's strike with her nightsword, raised her voice to make the next move to Raisa Ulunova.

Just as the kadmos knight swung down his longsword, Raisa appeared behind him and released the power she had accumulated by twisting her body, striking the tip of a large dagger that carried momentum.

<blank>

Attack Boost."

The dagger's blade is ridden with magical power, increasing its speed and weight.

The cartridge, having used up its boosting magic, was rejected from the chamber of the cuirass Raisa was wearing and fell through the air and to the ground in a cloud of white smoke.

The dagger bites deep into the back armor of the cadmos knight to the hand, and the weight of the blow sends the cadmos knight flying through the air.

Raisa continued to cast more magic into her dagger to stop the Kadmos Knight before its body hit the ground.

<blank>

The Sacred Flame.

The lines engraved on the arms of Raisa's light armor glow. A cartridge was rejected from the shoulder of the light armor.

As it is, the clean indigo glow that lights up the lines of the armor goes down toward the dagger. And then, with a thud, the Cadmos Knight was enveloped in a blue flame!　With a sound, the kadmos knight was enveloped in a blue flame and immediately collapsed without power.

<blank>

<blank>

The "magic storage cabinet" is used up every time, it's too strong! It's not funny!

'No time to whine, Raisa! Next!

<blank>

As Raisa breathed on his shoulder with tears in his eyes, Djimon Rietzmann shouted out with the round shield in his left hand, popping the longsword thrust that the next Cadmus Knight put in.

Raisa let out an "ooohhhhh" as she slid her body between the cadmos knight and the zimon and thrust her dagger into their chests.

But the cadmos knight repelled the dagger thrust with his own shield.

The fire in Kadmos Knight's supposedly emotionless eyes flickered as if he were smiling. He quickly drew back his longsword and pointed it at Raisa.

In the next instant, the skull of the cadmosite was crushed and shattered, along with the helmet that covered it.

Magritte smashed it from behind with her nightsword, which was clothed in blue magic.

<blank>

Magritte readjusted her nightsword, exhaling one slow breath, and kept her guard up, searching for signs of her surroundings.

I had been feeling a presence clinging to me since a few minutes ago, and a cold feeling was running down my spine.

<blank>

Geez!!!!"

<blank>

Raisa's short scream echoed in the place, along with the sudden, violent metallic sound and the sparks that lit up the area.

Magritte and Djimon point their blades at the sudden movement.

<blank>

"Well, that's a good response, isn't it?"

<blank>

There stood a brown-skinned woman, grinning and raising the corners of her mouth in the form of a large, machete-like sword.

<blank>

Raisa had taken the slash from the great sword with her dagger, and had mitigated the impact by jumping backward as quickly as she could.

She twisted her body in mid-air as it was and barely landed now with all four limbs.

<blank>

"Hic ......, te, hand, numb ......"

Raisa! Get back on your feet!!!!"

<blank>

Djimon held up a round shield and put his body in front of Raisa as if to protect her.

<blank>

You guys have a little fun?"

<blank>

The brown woman ...... Joel holds a large sword in his hand and turns it around his body in a figure eight motion.

<blank>

Both of you! Put your holy chi in your weapons!

<blank>

At the same time Magritte shouted, he activated the reinforcing magic equipped on the "Heavy Mobile Magic Armor".

<blank>

Boost Up."

The magical markings on the armor Magritte wears all light up at once and glide toward their target with explosive force.

<blank>

But at the same time Magritte shouted, Joel was also in time and instantly in Zimon's sights.

Joel swings his greatsword into a sideways calm and flips Zimon and the entire round shield he was holding up.

As he was about to raise his great sword above his head and shoot down at Lysa, Magritte's nightsword, imbued with a pale blue holiness, plunged into Joel's heart from behind him.

<blank>

But the nightsword pierces the sky, and Joel's figure disappears from the scene.

Magritte immediately turns her nightsword to her dorsal side as if she were carrying it.

A moment later, with a violent sound, a large, machete-like sword struck the nightsword on Magritte's back.

Joel's eyes widen slightly for a moment.

<blank>

Magritte twisted her body while catching the greatsword behind her, twirled the nightsword, flicked the greatsword upward, and slammed the nightsword into Joel's open side.

Joel's brown skin rips open and fresh blood spurts out with vigor.

<blank>

Kihi!"

<blank>

Joel's cheeks turn slightly and the corners of his mouth turn up happily as he goes.

<blank>

You mean you know how to deal with us? Hee-hee!

<blank>

Joel came down with the great sword as it was raised.

Magritte held her nightsword at an angle so as to lower the tip of the sword, deflected the swordstrike of the great sword that was struck down to her side, and slashed the sword up as it was, further cutting Joel's skin.

<blank>

Aahi! Is the holy chi in there? The wound is intact! Yihi!

<blank>

Joel cleaves with his great sword, and Magritte catches it, flings it back, and slashes at him. Joel also catches it, plays with it, and slashes at it.

The two swords cross each other's swords again and again at a tremendous speed, and Joel's bare skin is covered in blood and open wounds.

Magritte's armor was also dented and gouged in several places by the destructive force of the great sword, and blood seeped out from various places.

<blank>

Oh, yeah! Good, good! ...... ugh! Yihi, yihi!"

<blank>

The more Joel hurts himself, the more his cheeks turn red, his eyes get moist, and the more he gets excited.

<blank>

He was so happy that he turned his great sword as if he were dancing.

A spray of blood surrounded Joel's brown skin.

<blank>

"......, but yours is just 'know.'"

<blank>

As if suddenly regaining his composure, Joel's eyes lost the light of enthusiasm that had been there just a moment before.

<blank>

Joel disappeared from Magritte's sight with a "bang.

Magritte quickly holds her nightsword as if she were carrying it on her shoulder, and at the same time, she focuses her attention to search the air around her.

Immediately afterward, he sensed a presence behind him, and he twisted his body so that his knight's sword was behind his back, guarding his heart.

<blank>

With a "zakurikku", I felt a shock on my left thigh.

The body shakes and cannot maintain its posture. The left leg refuses to support the body and leans to the left.

In my slanting vision, Joel's face emerged from the darkness, and I looked at Magritte.

<blank>

Yours is just a regular ......, and it might get through to those idiots who just rely on force, but it's a ......!"

<blank>

With a thud, Magritte's abdomen was smashed!　was delivered to Magritte's abdomen.

<blank>

Gah!

<blank>

Joel's sword swung out like a full swing and bit into Magritte's abdomen, sending her body flying with the force of the swing.

Magritte was struck in the back by a large tree behind her and crumpled to the ground.

Without moving his feet, Joel moved in front of Magritte in an instant, as if swaying, and stomped on Magritte's shoulder, who was leaning helplessly against a tree.

<blank>

Gah!

<blank>

Joel's wounds, which should have been inflicted by Magritte, had already disappeared cleanly.

Joel looks down at Magritte, who is screaming, blood flying from her mouth, her hands on her waist, her mouth empty of wounds, as she stomps and looks down at him.

<blank>

Joel holds Magritte down with his legs as it is, puts his hand on the chest of its armor, and tries to pull off the armor plates with force.

The armor creaked and crackled, and the sound of something shattering spread.

<blank>

Ugh! Gghh ......, omg ......!"

<blank>

Magritte grunts so much that Joel's hands are caked with power.

Soon, with a loud metallic clang, the stripped armor pieces were thrown away.

<blank>

Aaaaah!!!!"

"Hmmm, would that please Master Halbert?"

<blank>

Looking down at Magritte's face, which was losing blood, and her bare chest, Joel muttered with a cold gaze.

<blank>

Bubu, Captain!

Kuk! Damn it!

<blank>

Djimon and Raisa, who had recovered from the damage, also activated their enhanced magic and ran to pin Joel.

While moving, Raisa stuck out her left fist and continued to activate her attack magic.

<blank>

The Magic Bolt.

A magic bullet with destructive power was shot out toward the target.

Multiple light bullets are shot out of the ricer, and at the same time, a series of cartridges are rejected from the cuirass.

<blank>

Several light bullets land on Joel as if sucked into his body, but as soon as they reach his body, they scatter into sparks and disappear.

<blank>

Tsk!"

<blank>

Five light bullets could be fired per cartridge.

The undead that had attacked us earlier would have been slaughtered with a single hit, but the vampire's resistance to magic is quite high.

Raisa stopped firing a barrage of "Magic Bolts," activated the "Quickstep" that was planted in her boots, and closed the gap between her and Joel at once.

<blank>

At the same time Raisa stops shooting the "Magic Bolt," Djimon now releases his magic.

<blank>

The Magic Cage.

Cartridge is rejected from the round shield.

The activated magic made a pentagonal magic circle appear at Joel's feet.

The magic circle unfolded and assembled in succession, creating a dodecahedral cage.

The cage surrounds Joel's entire body, but when he swings his great sword as if to say that he is in the way, the magic circle dissipates and disappears.

<blank>

It only took a moment for Joel to stop moving.

But in that split second, Raisa closes in on Joel.

<blank>

Raisa closed the distance with her activated "Quick Step," zigzagging her trajectory and twisting her body to the left and right as if she were dancing.

<blank>

Cross Blow

As if rising from a low position, a barrage of daggers held in opposite hands is delivered from both sides in rapid succession.

Gaga Gaga ...... and the uninterrupted metallic sound echoes through the forest.

<blank>

"Get ...... away from the troop leader!

You guys aren't good enough. Hee-hee.

Coo! You!

<blank>

Joel grinned and raised the corner of his mouth, his eyes narrowed in amusement as he continued to deal with Raisa's barrage of blows with his great sword.

Then, Djimon, who had thrown away his shield and swung his nightsword with both hands, struck down with a single sword filled with all his strength.

<blank>

A knightsword, clad in a pale blue sanctity, runs its blade across Joel's brown shoulder as if it were being sucked in.

<blank>

With a thud, the nightsword pierced the earth.

<blank>

Djimon stared down at his nightsword, which had eaten into the earth, and his eyes widened.

I looked up to follow the line of the sword, which I felt no response from, and saw a band of something black swirling around Joel's body along the path of the nightsword.

The black something goes directly over the right half of Joel's body.

No, it is changing.

Joel's body turns into a black mist and he is transformed into an insubstantial being.

But its left half of its body was still present, and it continued to handle Raisa's dagger with its left hand, which held a large sword.

<blank>

Joel looks over his shoulder at Djimon, red lips lifted, white fangs peeking out, and smirks.

Bwari and Joel's entire body turned into a black mist and disappeared from the scene.

<blank>

Suddenly losing his target, Dagger slashed through the air, Raisa's eyes widened, and he stepped on the tatara.

<blank>

Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!"

<blank>

The next moment, a large sword like a machete was deeply embedded in Djimon's right shoulder.

Behind Djimon, Joel is standing with his greatsword raised in the air, his mouth agape with laughter.

<blank>

When Joel pulled the great sword from Djimon's shoulder, Djimon coughed up blood and collapsed in place.

Furthermore, Joel kicked Djimon out of the way and slammed him into the trees in the forest.

<blank>

Mr. Djimon!

<blank>

Raisa shouts, and at the same time, she notices that Joel has disappeared from sight again, and she goes to search for signs of Joel, holding her dagger and keeping an eye on her surroundings.

<blank>

Only the sound of my own breathing seemed to echo unnecessarily around me. The sound of my feet shifting slightly, the sound of my feet stepping on the earth was strangely audible.

I could hear Djimon moaning behind the trees. Thank God, he is still alive.

Raisa felt relief that Djimon was alive, but then she felt a chilling presence rise up from her left side.

<blank>

Raisa did not hesitate to slash with her dagger toward the tip of the sign.

But the dagger just slashes through the sky.

At the same time, a powerful shock burst on Raisa's right side.

Raisa heard her equipment creak and her right humerus make an impossible sound.

<blank>

Aggghh! Geeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

Blown away by Joel's powerful spinning kick, Raisa bounced and rolled repeatedly on the ground, screaming in pain.

Raisa is rolled over the rock face, bounced by trees, and finally stops rolling, lying on the ground, moaning faintly.

<blank>

Joel approached Raisa, who was lying on the ground, grabbed her by the shoulder and lifted her up, then slammed a knee kick into her dove tail.

The armor of the torso was caved in, and Joel's knees were deeply reduced to Raisa's body.

Several ribs would have been broken and several internal organs damaged. Raisa bent her body into a crouch and spit out blood along with its contents with a squeezing grunt.

Whatever little consciousness Raisa had retained was completely let go of there.

<blank>

Joel grabbed the unconscious Raisa by her short honey blonde hair and lifted her up to his face level.

I looked around at Raisa's face, which was lifted without effort, as if to inspect it carefully, and then I put my nose close to it and sniffed it. ......

<blank>

"Hmmm! This one is also for Mr. Halbert. ...... will be enough for your enjoyment."

<blank>

After saying this, he unceremoniously threw Raisa's body away.

<blank>

As Joel waved one hand in the air, the shadows at his feet widened, and from the shadows came a group of maid-like figures, all dressed in white, with their heads hanging down, rising out of the shadows.

<blank>

Treat him well enough so he doesn't die."

<blank>

Bowing their heads again to follow Joel's words, the white maids sink back into the shadows and disappear, leaving Magritte and Raisa's bodies trailing behind them.

Eventually, they disappeared as if melting into the shadows of the forest.
