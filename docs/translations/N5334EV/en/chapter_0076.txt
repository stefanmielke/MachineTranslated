# Chapter 71: The Vampire at Dawn Part 1

Thank you for your patience<m(__)m>

It has become lengthy, so I will split it into two parts.

<b>

"Part 2" is currently in production (＠_＠;)

----------------

<b>

“……They’re coming!”

<b>

Captain Cornell Walrich of the Solid Squad spoke briefly, positioning his shield in front of him, lowering his stance, and preparing for the impending impact.

<b>

The Solid Squad held back the horde of undead surging like a mountain tsunami through the gaps in the walls.

The impact resonated as if the earth and atmosphere were struck by a giant hammer, and the "Full Phalanx" absorbed it.

<b>

It had been over an hour of continuously absorbing the shock.

The attackers, overflowing from the phalanx, were being slaughtered by those responsible for the offense as much as possible, but there was no sign of it stopping at all.

<b>

Outside the phalanx, in front, the three members of Amukamu, along with Vice Captain Kyle Urban and Team Leader Tony Easton, continued to cut down the undead like a snow avalanche.

<b>

Occasionally appearing large or special types of undead were also being defeated just like the others.

For the three members of Amukamu, it might not matter whether it was just a skeleton or a disaster-class being capable of destroying an entire city with a single one... Cornell thought as he watched Conrad blow away a great skull with a swing of his axe from the back.

<b>

The undead that Cornell and the others were currently holding back with the phalanx were indeed the oversights of Howard and the others at the front line, but even so, they were not a normal number.

Currently, the Solid Squad, deploying the Full Phalanx, consisted of only three members, including Cornell.

In the previous vampire attack, three of them had fallen into a state of combat incapacity. They had survived, but were not in a condition to participate in battle.

<b>

The defensive fortifications built by the logistics unit were also destroyed during the attack, leaving large holes.

The knights removed the rubble and rebuilt the barricades.

The wall itself still retained the effects of the "Holy Artifacts" applied by the holy class members.

The undead did not attempt to touch it.

<b>

The same was true for the silver wall that surrounded "Kuroiwa."

The undead avoided the wall, which was a "Holy Artifact," and overflowed through the large hole that had opened there.

<b>

Thanks to this, the unit was barely holding out by only being wary of the exit.

If they were attacked from all directions, it would have been impossible to manage.

In a chaotic battle, those who could not move would be taken down first.

<b>

The undead surged toward the "hole" in the fortifications blocked by the three members of the Solid Squad.

Cornell, at the center of the three, raised the magical power contained in the phalanx and boosted it, increasing the power of the "Full Phalanx."

With a shout, they absorbed and pushed back the white murky tide that surged forth.

Just after the "Full Phalanx" converged, Cornell felt a heavy weight pressing down on his body.

Due to the continuous excessive magical power supply to the phalanx, the magic power storage device of the heavy mobile magical armor was depleted, and Cornell's own magical power was directly used to maintain the activation of the magical armor.

<b>

At that moment, someone was running towards Cornell and the others from behind, keeping low and vigilant.

It was a member of the logistics unit, carrying a large backpack on their shoulder.

Taking advantage of a gap in the battle, the logistics member attached themselves right behind Cornell and quickly removed the large box attached to his waist with practiced hands, pulling out its contents.

Then, from the backpack, they took out an item of the same shape as the one they had removed and inserted it back into the same place.

After that, they quickly returned the removed box and distanced themselves from Cornell.

<b>

“This is the last fully charged magic power storage device. May you have good fortune in battle!”

<b>

The logistics member said this to Cornell and then immediately went to the other two members of the Solid Squad to perform the same battery exchange.

<b>

“It will be dawn in just two hours! Until then, we will hold out!!”

<b>

Cornell raised his voice, and the Full Phalanx absorbed the murky wave of undead.

<b>

It was already well past 3 AM. The sun should begin to rise before 6 AM.

In reality, there were about two and a half hours left until dawn.

Once morning arrived, the activity of the undead would be restricted.

If exposed to the morning sun, even lower-tier undead would likely disintegrate, and even higher-tier ones would not escape unscathed.

<b>

In the back, Cedric was rallying the members. Even now, he was likely slaying the spilled enemies while evacuating the injured.

<b>

This was the critical moment.

Cornell took a magazine filled with magic accumulation units from his waist pouch, replaced the empty one attached to the Tower Shield, and lowered his stance again.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The significant difference between the "magical armor" used by Howard and the others of Amukamu and the "heavy mobile magical armor" equipped by the knights lies in its versatility.

<b>

The "magical armor" used by Amukamu changes its performance greatly depending on the user's magical power level.

Moreover, the items adjusted and crafted according to the user's magical power further enhance the abilities of the wearer.

The combat value is purely determined by the individual's ability. That is Amukamu's "magical armor."

<b>

On the other hand, the "heavy mobile magical armor" used by the knights can deliver a high combat value regardless of the wearer's abilities.

This is because it can be enhanced by supplying magical power from the magic power storage device.

As a result, the wearer can achieve a combat value above a certain threshold, regardless of their magical power level.

If the wearer's magical power is added to the magical power supplied from the storage device, further enhancement can also be expected.

Of course, for that, the wearer needs to have a corresponding level of magical power control ability...

<b>

Additionally, by using various cartridges installed in the "magical manifestation devices" throughout the equipment, they can activate magic for enhancement, support, attack, recovery, etc., without consuming their own magical power, regardless of the wearer's magical attributes.

This allows them to gain an advantage in combat by using cartridges suited to the situation.

<b>

Originally, a high combat value that could not be reached without high physical abilities and advanced magical power control skills.

The stability that allows all wearers to achieve that high combat value. And the options to use different magic with cartridges according to the situation.

This versatility is the greatest feature of the "heavy mobile magical armor."

<b>

<b>

<b>

Once again, Cornell's massive body stomped the ground, pushing back the raging waves of undead.

The magic power storage device that had exhausted the "Phalanx" flew out from the Tower Shield, enveloped in white smoke.

<b>

At that moment, Cornell caught sight of something glowing ahead in the horde of undead rushing toward him.

Cornell's intuition instantly triggered an alarm.

In a hurry, he fully opened the pathway of the newly loaded magic power storage device and poured magical power into the activated "Full Phalanx."

In the next moment, a vibration like an explosion roared, and a torrent of fierce flames engulfed Cornell and the others along with the surrounding undead.

<b>

The skin sizzled and fine hairs burned. In the high heat that stole the oxygen, breathing was impossible. Even if one tried to inhale, their lungs would have been scorched in an instant.

Even activating the "Full Phalanx" at high output brought such heat. What would have happened if there had been even a slight delay in response?

Cornell gritted his teeth, feeling the hair on his body stand on end as he endured the pressure of the explosive flames.

<b>

As the flames that had ravaged the surroundings subsided, Cornell slowly opened his eyes.

The area was charred over a wide range, the few shrubs and grasses that had grown on the surface were burned away, exposing the black rocky ground.

The trees within the range of the explosion were not even allowed to catch fire, instead, they carbonized and crumbled halfway.

<b>

The barricades surrounding the defensive fortifications were completely burned down, and the surrounding walls were charred nearly halfway through their thickness. It seemed that the strength they had previously possessed could no longer be expected.

<b>

The undead that had filled the area were mostly turned to ash, and those that could still move, having lost parts of their bodies, writhed and directed their resentment toward the living.

<b>

And in front of Cornell and the others, Howard and the others wielding their swords were...

Standing firmly in the scorched wasteland.

<b>

Conrad, with both legs planted firmly on the ground.

He supported the massive battle axe thrust out in front of him like a shield with both hands, emitting white smoke from all over his body.

Howard and Gilbert were supporting Conrad from either side, placing their hands on his back.

Behind those three, Kyle was kneeling, gripping his two-handed sword buried in the ground with both hands, while Tony had his knight sword also thrust into the ground, using his kite shield with one hand to guard himself, enduring the explosive flames.

<b>

<b>

“Ax Fort”

A defensive technique similar to the "Phalanx" of Cornell and the knights.

By channeling magical power into the raised battle axe, it becomes a magical shield with high physical and magical resistance, serving as a shield for the party members.

Howard and Gilbert supported this technique by placing their palms on Conrad's back, channeling magical power to boost its performance.

The three had quickly formed this formation to withstand the explosive flames.

<b>

It also significantly reduced the heat directed at the Solid Squad and prevented it from affecting the members behind them.

<b>

<b>

“Oh? You managed to endure this too?”

<b>

Aside from the sound of crackling flames, a surprised female voice was heard in the now quiet forest.

<b>

“I apologize for keeping you waiting. …However, it seems the party venue is sufficiently warmed up, doesn’t it?”

<b>

Dressed in a black night dress, a woman named Electra appeared from beyond the crumbled wall, emerging from the depths of the forest like a shadow.

<b>

“Did you try to burn us along with your minions...? Using this many, you must be quite extravagant, Vampire!!”

“Oh? Did you not like the view?”

<b>

Electra tilted her head, grinning mischievously at Howard, who glared at her.

<b>

“Damn that woman...!”

<b>

Conrad, with a fierce grin, felt a vein bulge on his forehead.

However, Howard immediately moved without hesitation.

Sliding across the ground, he entered the range of the Grand Divider, aiming to catch Electra and swung his blade horizontally to the left.

<b>

But the blade sparked violently as it clashed.

<b>

“...!”

“Ugh...! No!!”

<b>

Howard’s sword was blocked by a massive sword resembling a large machete held by a brown-skinned woman who had suddenly emerged from the darkness. In that brief moment, Electra managed to escape to the back.

The brown-skinned woman... Joel groaned as she received Howard's sword strike.

<b>

At that moment, Conrad swung his massive battle axe overhead and forcefully slashed down toward the ground.

One slash, two slashes, three slashes. He continued to slice through the ground, carving deep gashes into it like claw marks.

Then, from those gashes, as if the earth had been wounded, blood splattered up in multiple jets.

<b>

At the same time, Gilbert dashed into the forest.

From a low position, he directed a pale green sword flash toward the darkness.

<b>

“Damn it!”

<b>

From there, a woman with pale blue skin... Marina emerged from the lurking darkness, dodging Gilbert's sword flash as her body swayed and she swiftly moved further back.

<b>

“Drawing attention with that massive firework and then trying to sneak chains into the ground to target the ones behind? And that black hair is for protection and diversion, huh? Once the trick is revealed, it’s all over! Don’t underestimate us!!”

<b>

Conrad roared at the women.

<b>

“...Hmph”

<b>

Electra, with her hand still at her mouth, let out a small snort.

<b>

“So... what seems to be the problem?”

<b>

The three women stood close together.

As she casually brushed her hair behind her ear, Electra addressed Howard and the others.

<b>

“Nothing has changed in the situation, has it...?”

“...That’s enough, Electra. I wanted to see the look on their faces when they were caught, but... well, it can’t be helped.”

<b>

Marina, draping her left hand over Electra's shoulder, placed her right index finger at her mouth, looking disappointed as she furrowed her brows.

The three women huddled together, giggling.

<b>

“...”

“...You bastards!”

<b>

Howard and Conrad gritted their teeth at the sight of the women.

<b>

“Since it’s a party, let’s make sure to entertain properly, shall we?”

“Oh? Can we finally play seriously? I’m all for it!”

“Now, Joel? Be moderate, will you?”

<b>

Electra stepped forward, adding a theatrical flair to her movements, and with her dress opened in a large V shape, she waved her palms in front of her chest.

Then, a small leather pouch appeared in her hands, just the right size to fit.

Electra smiled as if the show magic had succeeded, placing her hands on her hips and lifting the pouch to her chest.

Then, she reached into the leather pouch she had pulled out, her hand emerging with a rattling grasp on something inside.

It was a sharp, pointed fang, about 2 to 3 centimeters in length.

Grasping the fangs, Electra scattered them like seeds between herself and Howard and the others.

<b>

“Now everyone! The party resumes! Dance and revel until morning!!”

<b>

Electra spread her arms dramatically and raised her voice in a singing manner, as the ground where the fangs were scattered began to swell.

From there, numerous skeletal knights clad in sturdy armor crawled out.

<b>

“Cadmos Knights”

High-tier skeletal warriors said to be born from dragon fangs.

Their threat level is “55.” This is comparable to upper-tier beings.

<b>

There were about twenty of them, writhing and moving all together.

In an instant, they emerged from the ground, swiftly avoiding Howard and his group as they began to charge toward the expedition team positioned behind them.

<b>

“What the hell?!!”

“Ugh! Are they targeting the weak?!”

“Don’t think you can become wall decorations! Tonight, all of you are the main characters! No more dealing with the riffraff! These ones will ensure you won’t be bored!!”

<b>

Electra declared that the “Cadmos Knights” were different from the undead they had faced before.

Immediately, Howard and the others activated the magical seals on their leather armor, crushing the skeletal warriors trying to slip past them along with their hard armor, but they were suddenly blocked by a rising black wall from below.

<b>

“Damn it! These guys again!!”

<b>

Conrad shouted in frustration.

It was the three large black undead they had seen earlier. They once again blocked Howard and the others' path.

<b>

“You all should play here a little longer♪”

<b>

Marina stood atop a massive black skull, swaying the chains in the air as she addressed Howard and the others.

Howard, Conrad, Gilbert, and the two others, Kyle and Tony, were cut off from their main force and isolated at the front line.

<b>

“Damn it! Tony!! Kyle!! Hold on!! Don’t die on me!!!”

<b>

Conrad shouted as he received the charge of the black giant with his battle axe.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“Lysa!!”

<b>

Marguerite Goche deflected the attack of a Cadmos Knight with her knight sword and called out to Lysa Ulunova to follow up.

As the Cadmos Knight swung down its longsword, Lysa appeared behind it, twisting her body to unleash the power she had stored, driving the tip of her large dagger into it.

<b>

“Attack Boost”

The magical power surged onto the dagger's blade, enhancing its speed and weight.

The cartridge used for the boost magic was ejected from the chamber of the gauntlet Lysa was wearing, swirling in white smoke as it flew through the air and fell to the ground.

The dagger sank deeply into the armor of the Cadmos Knight, and with the weight of that strike, the Cadmos Knight was sent flying.

Lysa then prepared to deliver the finishing blow before the Cadmos Knight hit the ground, channeling more magic into her dagger.

<b>

“Holy Flame”

The lines etched on Lysa's light armor glowed. A cartridge was ejected from the shoulder of the light armor.

The pure blue light that lit up the armor's lines descended toward the dagger. Then, with a sound, the Cadmos Knight was enveloped in blue flames and quickly collapsed powerless.

<b>

<b>

“Using the magic power storage device with every attack is too tough! This isn’t a joke!!”

“Now’s not the time to complain, Lysa! Next!!”

<b>

With tears in her eyes and panting heavily, Lysa slid between the Cadmos Knight and Jimon Reitzman, who was holding a round shield in his left hand, deflecting the thrust of the next Cadmos Knight's longsword.

Lysa let out a small whimper as she slipped in, stabbing her dagger into the knight's chest.

However, the Cadmos Knight deflected the dagger's thrust with its own shield.

The emotionless eyes of the Cadmos Knight flickered as if it had smirked. The Cadmos Knight quickly pulled back the deflected longsword and aimed its blade at Lysa.

In the next moment, the skull of the Cadmos Knight was shattered along with the helmet covering it, scattering into pieces.

Marguerite had smashed it with her knight sword, enveloped in blue magical power from behind.

<b>

Marguerite then readied her knight sword again, slowly exhaling as she remained vigilant, sensing a presence lurking around her.

Since earlier, she had felt a presence that seemed to cling to her, sending a chill down her spine.

<b>

“Gyuuh!!”

<b>

Suddenly, a loud metallic sound echoed, accompanied by sparks illuminating the area, as Lysa's short scream rang out.

Marguerite and Jimon turned their blades toward the sudden movement.

<b>

“Hey, you have good reflexes, don’t you?”

<b>

There stood a brown-skinned woman, grinning with her large sword raised as if she had just swung it.

<b>

Lysa received the slash from the large sword with her dagger, and by jumping back instinctively, she managed to mitigate the impact.

She twisted her body in mid-air and barely landed on her feet.

<b>

“Ugh... my hands... are numb...”

“Lysa! Get back on your feet!!”

<b>

Jimon raised his round shield, stepping in front of Lysa to protect her.

<b>

“Do you think you can have a little fun?”

<b>

The brown-skinned woman... Joel swung her large sword in a figure-eight motion around her body.

<b>

“Both of you! Channel holy energy into your weapons!!”

<b>

Marguerite shouted as she activated the enhancement magic equipped in her heavy mobile magical armor.

<b>

“Boost Up”

The magical seals on Marguerite's armor glowed simultaneously, shooting toward the target with explosive momentum.

<b>

However, at the same time Marguerite shouted, Joel closed the distance and instantly appeared right in front of Jimon.

Joel swung her large sword horizontally, knocking Jimon and his round shield away.

As she swung her large sword overhead, aiming to bring it down on Lysa, Marguerite’s pale blue knight sword, imbued with holy energy, was thrust toward Joel's heart from behind.

<b>

However, the knight sword pierced the air, and Joel's figure vanished from the spot.

Marguerite quickly swung her knight sword behind her.

In an instant, with a loud noise, Joel’s large sword struck Marguerite's knight sword from behind.

Joel’s eyes widened slightly for a moment.

<b>

While Marguerite held back the large sword behind her, she twisted her body, entangling the knight sword to deflect the large sword upward, and thrust the knight sword into Joel's exposed side.

Joel's brown skin split open, and fresh blood gushed out violently.

<b>

“Guh!”

<b>

Joel's cheek flushed slightly as she grinned, looking pleased.

<b>

“Looks like you know a little about how to fight us, huh? Hehe!”

<b>

Joel brought her raised large sword down toward Marguerite.

Marguerite angled the tip of her knight sword downward and diagonally, deflecting the descending large sword's trajectory to the side, and slashed upward with her sword, further cutting into Joel's skin.

<b>

“Ah! Is it imbued with holy energy? The wound remains! Hehe!!”

<b>

Joel swung her large sword, and Marguerite received it, deflecting and slashing back. Joel also received it and countered.

At an incredible speed, their swords crossed repeatedly, opening multiple wounds on Joel's exposed skin, soaking her in blood.

Marguerite's armor was also dented and gouged in several places by the destructive power of the large sword, oozing blood from various spots.

<b>

“Ah! This is good, good! ...Ugh! Hehe, hehe!”

<b>

As Joel's wounds increased, her cheeks flushed, and her eyes glistened with excitement.

<b>

She swayed her black hair, seemingly thrilled, as she danced and twirled her large sword.

Blood splattered around her, enveloping Joel's brown skin.

<b>

“...But you only 'know' how to fight.”

<b>

Suddenly regaining her composure, the heated light in Joel's eyes vanished.

<b>

In that instant, Joel vanished in a blur from Marguerite's sight.

Marguerite instinctively readied her knight sword on her shoulder, concentrating her senses to detect the surrounding air.

Moments later, sensing a presence from behind, she twisted her body to guard her heart with the knight sword.

<b>

With a sharp impact, she felt a jolt in her left thigh.

Her body shook, and she lost her balance. Her left leg refused to support her, tilting her to the left.

In her tilting vision, Joel's face emerged from the darkness, peering down at Marguerite.

<b>

“Your kind might work against ordinary... just stupid ones who rely on brute strength!”

<b>

With a powerful swing, Joel's large sword struck Marguerite's abdomen.

<b>

“Gah!!”

<b>

With a full swing, Joel's large sword sank into Marguerite's abdomen, sending her flying with its momentum.

Marguerite slammed against a large tree from behind, collapsing to the ground.

Joel didn’t even move his legs; in an instant, he swayed forward, appearing right in front of Magritte. As Magritte leaned weakly against a tree, Joel forcefully stomped down on his shoulder.

<b>

“Gahhh!!”

<b>

The wounds Joel had received from Marguerite had already healed completely.

Looking down at Marguerite, who was bleeding from her mouth and gasping, Joel grinned coldly.

<b>

Joel continued to hold Magritte down with his foot, gripping the chest plate of his armor with one hand and attempting to rip it off with sheer force.

The armor groaned and creaked under the strain, accompanied by sharp cracking sounds as parts of it began to splinter and break apart.

<b> 

"Ugh! Gah… ugh…"

<b>

The more strength Joel put into his grip, the more strained groans escaped from Magritte.

Finally, with a resounding metallic clank, a large piece of armor was torn off and discarded, crashing to the ground.

<b>

"Ahhh!!!"

“Hmm, I wonder if Lord Halbert would be pleased with this?”

<b>

As Marguerite's face lost color and her chest was exposed, Joel muttered while looking down at her.

<b>

“Captain!!”

“Damn it!!”

<b>

Jimon and Lysa, who had regained their footing from the damage, activated their enhancement magic and rushed in to sandwich Joel.

As they moved, Lysa thrust her left fist forward, activating an attack magic simultaneously.

<b>

“Magic Bolt”

A projectile of magical power imbued with destructive force was fired toward the target.

Multiple light projectiles were shot from Lysa, and simultaneously, cartridges were ejected from her gauntlet in succession.

<b>

Many light projectiles struck Joel, seeming to be absorbed into her body, but upon reaching her, they exploded into sparks and vanished.

<b>

“Damn it!!”

<b>

Each cartridge could fire five light projectiles.

If it had been the undead that had attacked them earlier, one hit would have surely taken them down, but this vampire's magical resistance was exceptionally high.

Lysa stopped the barrage of "Magic Bolts," activating "Quick Step" embedded in her boots, closing the distance to Joel in one go.

<b>

As Lysa ceased firing "Magic Bolts," Jimon unleashed his magic.

<b>

“Magic Cage”

A cartridge was ejected from the round shield.

The activated magic created a pentagonal magic circle that floated beneath Joel's feet.

The magic circle continued to expand and assemble, forming a dodecahedron cage.

The cage surrounded Joel completely, but with a dismissive swing of her large sword, Joel shattered the magic circle, scattering it and causing it to disappear.

<b>

Joel was only momentarily halted.

However, in that instant, Lysa closed in on Joel.

<b>

Using "Quick Step," Lysa zigzagged her way forward, twisting her body as she danced right and left, closing the distance. Just as the "Magic Cage" shattered, she channeled magical power into the large daggers equipped in both her hands, launching an attack.

<b>

“Cross Blow”

A series of reverse-handed dagger strikes surged upward from a low position, coming in rapid succession from both sides.

The sound of metal clashing echoed through the forest.

<b>

“Get away from the captain!!”

“You all aren’t enough to handle me. Hehe!”

“Damn it!!”

<b>

Joel smirked, narrowing her eyes in delight as she continued to parry Lysa's flurry of strikes with her large sword.

At that moment, Jimon, discarding his shield, raised his knight sword with both hands and swung down with all his might.

<b>

The knight sword, enveloped in pale blue holy energy, sliced toward Joel's brown shoulder, seemingly absorbing the blade's impact.

<b>

With a thud, the knight sword pierced the ground.

<b>

Jimon stared at his knight sword embedded in the earth, his eyes wide open.

He felt no resistance from the strike, and as he raised his gaze, he saw a swirling black mist wrapping around Joel's body where the knight sword had struck.

That black mist gradually enveloped Joel's right side.

No, it was changing.

Joel's body transformed into a black mist, becoming an incorporeal entity.

Yet her left side remained intact, continuing to parry Lysa's dagger strikes with her left hand.

<b>

Joel glanced back at Jimon over her shoulder, her red lips curling into a smile as she revealed her white fangs.

With a whoosh, Joel's entire body turned into black mist and vanished from the spot.

<b>

Suddenly losing her target, Lysa's daggers sliced through the air, and she stumbled back, wide-eyed.

<b>

“Gahhh!!”

<b>

In the next moment, Joel's large sword sank deeply into Jimon's right shoulder.

Behind Jimon, Joel stood, grinning as she pulled the sword back.

<b>

As Joel withdrew the large sword from Jimon's shoulder, he coughed up blood and collapsed to the ground.

Joel then kicked Jimon aside as if he were an obstacle, sending him crashing into the trees.

<b>

“Jimon!!!”

<b>

Lysa shouted, realizing at the same time that Joel had vanished from sight again. She stood ready with her daggers, searching for Joel's presence.

<b>

It felt as if only her own breathing echoed unnecessarily around her. Just shifting her stance made the sound of her feet on the ground seem oddly pronounced.

She could hear Jimon groaning from behind the trees. Good, he was still alive.

Lysa felt relief at Jimon's survival, but at that moment, she sensed a chilling presence rising from her left side.

<b>

Without hesitation, Lysa slashed toward the source of the presence with her dagger.

However, the dagger merely sliced through the air.

At the same time, a violent shockwave erupted from her right side.

Lysa heard her armor creak, and her right humerus made an impossible sound.

<b>

“Ugh! Gyaaah!!”

<b>

Blown away by Joel's powerful roundhouse kick, Lysa cried out in pain as she rolled and bounced across the ground.

She tumbled over rocky surfaces and was knocked against trees, finally coming to a stop on the ground, groaning weakly.

<b>

As Joel approached Lysa, who was lying on the ground, she grabbed her shoulder and lifted her up, delivering a knee strike to her solar plexus.

The armor around Lysa's torso crumpled, and Joel's knee sank deeply into her body.

Several ribs must have broken, and some internal organs were likely damaged. Lysa bent over, letting out a strained groan as she coughed up blood.

The consciousness Lysa had barely maintained slipped away completely.

<b>

Joel grabbed Lysa's short honey-blonde hair, lifting her face to her eye level.

Examining Lysa's face closely, she leaned in to sniff her, then...

<b>

“Hmm! This one is also for Lord Halbert. ...I can have plenty of fun with her.”

<b>

With that, she carelessly tossed Lysa's body aside.

<b>

As Joel waved her hand dismissively, shadows spread at her feet, and figures dressed entirely in white, resembling maids, emerged from the shadows, bowing their heads as they rose.

<b>

“Treat them without letting them die.”

<b>

Following Joel's command, the white maids bowed again and began dragging Marguerite and Lysa's bodies back into the shadows.

<b>

Once the maids disappeared into the shadows, Joel turned her gaze toward the north, where Howard and the others were still engaged in battle, sensing the fluctuation of magical power.

<b>

“The sky is starting to brighten... It should be about an hour until sunrise? There’s still some time left, huh? After all, I want to have a little fun with that old man... I’ve secured some souvenirs, so it’s no problem to play a bit more, right? ...Ah, heh, hehe!”

<b>

Joel wrapped her arms around herself, caressing her body, her eyes glistening as she let out a sultry sigh.

Then, she melted away into the shadows of the forest.

<b>

Next time: "The Vampire at Dawn Part 2"

<b>

The protagonist will finally appear in the following story (≡ω≡;)
