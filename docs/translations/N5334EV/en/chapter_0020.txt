# Chapter 20: Suzy Cloud and the School Lunch Break

The textbooks were divided into nine levels, and the children were learning with textbooks corresponding to their respective levels.

<b>

From the first level, where they learned to count and write letters, to the highest level, the ninth, children aged 7 to 15 were learning in the same classroom.

<b>

Level 1: 2 boys, 2 girls.

Level 2: 3 boys, 1 girl.

Level 3: 2 boys, 2 girls.

Level 4: 1 boy, 2 girls.

Level 5: 2 boys, 1 girl.

Level 6: 3 boys, 2 girls.

Level 7: 2 boys, 2 girls.

Level 8: 1 boy, 2 girls.

Level 9: 2 boys, 3 girls.

<b>

There were 18 boys and 17 girls, making a total of 35 students in the school.

<b>

"Since you're joining, there will be 18 girls, making a total of 36!"

<b>

Beatrice told me.

<b>

<b>

The children were studying by grouping their desks according to their levels.

<b>

It seemed that the teachers provided direct instruction according to the curriculum, but when they didn't understand something, they would learn from nearby upperclassmen, indicating that the system was fundamentally one of self-directed learning.

<b>

(I only know from the news, but is it somewhat like Japan's free schools?)

<b>

For now, Suzy, who had to start by learning letters, would study near the 7-year-olds in the first level.

<b>

Receiving instructions from Mrs. Jameson to copy letters, she began transcribing from the textbook, but soon noticed the gazes of the surrounding children.

<b>

The girl sitting right in front of her was glancing at Suzy's hair and completely neglecting her work.

The child sitting next to her was the same.

<b>

It seemed that these kids were so curious about Suzy that they couldn't focus on their studies.

<b>

"Do you... want to touch it?"

<b>

The girl who was asked suddenly blushed and looked down.

<b>

"Can I... touch it?"

<b>

When Suzy asked again, the girl looked up, surprised, as if to say, "Really?"

<b>

It's fine, Suzy replied, tilting her head so that the ends of her gathered hair pointed towards the girl.

She intentionally kept a little distance.

<b>

Tentatively trying to reach out, the girl leaned closer, and just as her head got close... Suzy shook her head, tickling the girl's nose with the tips of her hair.

<b>

"Kyahhh!" The girl's delighted voice echoed.

Suzy and the girl laughed together, their faces close.

<b>

"I want to too! I want to too!" another girl chimed in, so Suzy brought her face closer and tickled her with the tips of her hair, making her shrug her shoulders and squeal, "Yayyy!"

<b>

Two boys were watching enviously, so Suzy tickled them in the same way.

<b>

The children completely warmed up to her, and both girls ended up sitting closely beside Suzy.

<b>

"I've never seen such beautiful red hair before!"

<b>

As the girls touched her hair, sparkling with excitement,

<b>

"How do you write 'red'...?"

<b>

Suzy asked, and they eagerly began to teach her.

While learning how to write and read the characters the children understood, Suzy read the math problems to them, explaining how to solve them.

<b>

(What can I say, I've always been popular with kids and beasts... Is it the same even if our bodies and worlds are different? Huh? But did Mrs. Jameson predict that this situation would happen...?)

<b>

As she looked at Mrs. Jameson smiling at her from the other end of the classroom, she couldn't help but think so. After all, she was quite a capable office worker...

<b>

Suzy thought to herself.

<b>

"That girl seems to be good with kids!"

"Suzy-chan looks kind."

"It's helpful that she takes care of the little ones."

"The amazing beautiful girl isn't just about strength, huh? Haha, that seems like a high hurdle... Huh? When did that person get over there?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

Feeling a strong presence targeting her from behind.

It was clear that there was no hesitation, and the hands were ready to grab her pigtails firmly.

<b>

Suzy smoothly dodged the outstretched hand aimed at her.

<b>

The hand grasped at the air for a moment, but then quickly glared and tried to grab her again.

Again, three times in a row, the hand was dodged, and the child kept trying to grab her repeatedly.

The surrounding children noticed the commotion and widened their eyes in surprise.

<b>

"...W-what...?!"

<b>

Finally, Stefan was out of breath, panting heavily.

<b>

"...What?"

<b>

Suzy tilted her head and asked back.

<b>

"W-why! Your hair... is so red!?"

<b>

He shouted at Suzy, his cheeks flushed.

<b>

Suzy gently cupped Stefan's face with both hands and brought her face closer.

He let out a small grunt.

Bringing their noses so close they almost touched, Suzy said,

<b>

"Why... is that?"

<b>

tilting her head and giving him a smile that seemed about to spill over.

<b>

With a pop, Stefan turned bright red and shouted, "Waaah!" as he shook off Suzy's hands and ran out of the classroom.

<b>

"Ah, ahahaha?" Suzy placed her hand on the back of her head and smiled shyly.

<b>

<b>

"Did you see that just now!?"

"Wow! Suzy-chan easily handled Stefan!"

"Oh my, did he... fall for her...?"

"She really is good with kids! ...Or rather, with boys??!"

"That's not it! That movement!! What was that!?"

"Huh? Movement? I don't think she moved that much?"

"That's right! It felt like she was swaying!"

"That's what makes it amazing! Dodging all that with just that is something normal people can't do! And her lower half didn't even budge from the chair! That's the realm of a master!!"

"Hmm... As expected of a martial artist, our perspectives are different."

"Uh, so... it's like she has eyes in the back of her head? Something like that?"

"Even if she could see behind her, she couldn't do that!! Look! Even Irvin is frozen with his eyes wide open. Ah! I'm getting goosebumps!"

"Hmph! I think Irvin is frozen for a different reason!"

"Ahh, I was jealous... wasn't I?"

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Lunch was eaten together on the grass on the south side of the school building.

<b>

Suzy was monopolized by the two younger students who had warmed up to her since the morning.

Layla Carter and Mabel Beaumont.

Both of them kept clinging to her, calling her "Suu-chan, Suu-chan."

<b>

"Can I call you Suu-chan too?"

<b>

Mia asked, and when Suzy replied, "Sure," everyone ended up calling her Suu.

<b>

During the meal, Suzy noticed a small animal on Beatrice's shoulder.

<b>

(Huh? Is that a pet mouse? It seems too big... maybe a hamster? A white hamster? But it has such a long tail.)

<b>

Its body was about 12 to 13 centimeters long, and with its tail, it could be around 30 centimeters.

The white mouse was receiving food from Beatrice on her shoulder and eating together with her.

Suzy asked Beatrice what it was.

<b>

"Huh? This little one? This is Algernon! My familiar! He's super smart!"

"He gets kicked out of the classroom during tests because he's too smart!"

"He's smarter than Bibi, so he answers in his place."

"Come on! That's not true!"

<b>

Understanding their conversation, Algernon looked at Suzy and twitched his nose.

It was as if he was saying, "I know about you."

Suddenly, Algernon slipped off Beatrice's shoulder and headed straight for Suzy.

Without hesitation, he climbed up to her shoulder and began sniffing around her ear.

<b>

"Ugh!"

<b>

Suzy involuntarily shrank back from the ticklish sensation.

After circling around her shoulder a few times, Algernon let out a "Kikyu!" and returned to Beatrice.

<b>

"Oh! Did he come to say hello? It seems he likes you!"

<b>

It seemed that even beasts could warm up to her.

<b>

"In the afternoon, we'll split into practical training with swords and spears and a magic study group. What will you do?"

<b>

Beatrice asked Suzy as everyone finished their meals.

<b>

"Either is fine! Everyone is doing what they're good at! Some switch it up depending on the day! What you do is up to you!"

<b>

(Hoh, it feels somewhat like club activities? Participation is basically voluntary. I guess there aren't any kids who skip. The people in this village, including the children, said they value strength. Well, living next to a dangerous forest means that weakness equals a life-threatening situation, so it's only natural to protect oneself...)

What should I do? The sword training seems fun since everyone is energetic, but for now, maybe magic? It would be great to learn about how magic works here.)

<b>

"I want to... learn... magic!"

"Ehーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーーー!?"

<b>

Dana, who had been looking at Suzy with sparkling eyes, voiced her dissatisfaction.

<b>

"Why!? Someone who can move like that shouldn't do magic! That's such a waste! Let's spar together, Suu!"

<b>

Suzy instinctively recoiled. She felt a bit overwhelmed by Dana, who was pressing closer with her hands.

<b>

"Dana. I understand you're disappointed, but you can't trouble Suu, okay?"

<b>

Colin warned Dana, adjusting his glasses with a finger.

<b>

"Ugh! I didn't mean to trouble her... but..."

"Suu-chan can handle a sword too?"

"I can... use it...!"

"But, you won't practice sword training?"

"I want to... learn magic... and when I settle down... I want to... practice sword training... too!"

"Really!? I thought you were only going for magic class! So, once you finish studying magic, you'll come for training, right?"

<b>

"Y-yeah," Suzy nodded, somewhat pushed by Dana's enthusiasm.

<b>

"I'm glad! It's a shame we can't spar today, but we'll be able to do it together soon, right!?"

"Y-yes... I'll do my best!"

<b>

Suzy showed her clenched fists, saying she would work hard on her magic studies and then go to sword training while looking at Dana.

<b>

"Thank you! I'm so happy, Suu!!"

<b>

Dana suddenly hugged Suzy tightly. Her face was buried in Dana's chest, and for a moment, she couldn't breathe.

<b>

"Ahhh! Come on! Suu is so cute! Youuu!!"

<b>

Dana continued to squeeze her even more.

<b>

"Ugh!!"

"Ah! Come on, Dana! It's unfair to hog her all to yourself!!"

<b>

Colin rushed in to rescue Suzy from Dana, but the two younger girls also clung to Suzy, saying, "Me too! Me too!"

<b>

Though Colin managed to free Suzy from Dana, the two extra girls came along, and he was crushed under their combined weight.

<b>

Dana reclaimed Suzy and spun around with all three of them.

Layla and Mabel were giggling with joy, while Suzy's eyes were spinning in circles.

<b>

Watching that, Mia murmured, "I'll hug her a lot later," and Beatrice steeled herself, thinking, "I have to hold my ground!"

<b>

The peaceful lunch hour passed by.
