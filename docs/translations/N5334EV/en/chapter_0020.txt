# 20 - School Lunch Break with Suzy Cloud

The textbooks were divided into nine levels, and each child studied in his or her own level textbook.

<blank>

Children from 7 to 15 years old, from the 1st level, where they learn to count and read and write, to the 9th level, the highest level taught in this school, are learning in one classroom.

<blank>

1 dan, 2 boys and 2 girls.

2dan, 3 boys and 1 girl.

3dan, 2 boys and 2 girls.

4-dan, 1 male and 2 female.

5-dan, 2 boys and 1 girl.

6th dan, 3 boys and 2 girls.

7 dan level, 2 boys and 2 girls.

8-dan, 1 male and 2 female.

9 dan level, 2 boys and 3 girls.

<blank>

There are 18 boys and 17 girls. In total, there are 35 students in the entire school.

<blank>

That's where Anta comes in, so that makes 18 girls, for a total of 36!"

<blank>

and Beatrice taught me.

<blank>

<blank>

The children are studying at their desks, which are pulled together by their respective ranks.

<blank>

The curriculum seems to be based on a system in which students learn on their own initiative, with teachers giving direct instruction, but when they don't understand something, they ask a nearby senior student to help them out.

<blank>

(I only know about it from the news or something, but is it like a free school in Japan?)

<blank>

For now, Suzy has to start by learning to read, so she will be studying near the seven-year-olds in the first level.

<blank>

Mrs. Jameson gave me instructions on how to write the letters, and I began to transcribe from the book, but within a few minutes I noticed the stares of the children around me.

<blank>

The girl sitting in front of me is glancing at Suzy's hair and her hands are completely absent.

The same goes for the child sitting next to him.

<blank>

Apparently, these kids are too busy studying to worry about Suzy.

<blank>

Does that bother you?

<blank>

The girl who was asked the question huffed and turned her head down, her face reddening as she looked at it.

<blank>

Do you want to... touch it?"

<blank>

I asked him again. What? Are you sure?　He looks up and asks, "What?

<blank>

I put my face to the side so that the ends of my hair are facing the girl.

Deliberately take a little distance.

<blank>

Fearfully trying to touch her, I sat up and when my face was close to hers, I shook ...... her head and tickled the tip of the girl's nose with the tip of my hair.

<blank>

Kyaaaan!　the girl's excited voice echoed.

Suzy and the girl laugh at each other again.

<blank>

Me too! Me too!　I brought her face close to mine and tickled her with the tips of my hair!　she said, shrugging her shoulders.

<blank>

The two boys looked at me enviously, so I tickled them the same way.

<blank>

The children missed her so much that both girls sat closely on either side of Susie.

<blank>

I've never seen such beautiful red hair!"

<blank>

Sparkling, and to the girls who touch their hair.

<blank>

"Red... how... do... you... write?"

<blank>

Suzy asks, "What do you want to do?

After that, while the children were taught how to write and read the letters they could understand, Suzy taught them how to solve the numerology problems by having them read the problems to her.

<blank>

(What can I say, I've always missed the giraffes and beasts so much. ...... Is it the same with different bodies and different worlds? Huh? But Mrs. Jameson, did you ever read about this kind of situation...?)

<blank>

I can see Mrs. smiling at me from the other end of the classroom.　She's still the bossy office worker who can do it. ......

<blank>

That's what Suzy thought.

<blank>

She's really good with kids!"

Susie seems so sweet."

It's nice to have someone to take care of the little ones."

A beautiful girl with great skills is more than just an armchair. I'm not sure. Haha, that sounds like a high hurdle. ...... Oh? When did she go over there?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I feel the presence of someone aiming at me from behind.

Without hesitation or anything, I can clearly see that he is ready to grab both pigtails tightly with both hands.

<blank>

He quickly lost his hand, which was extended with a bold aim.

<blank>

He grabs the sky and seems stunned for a moment, but then he glares at you and grabs you again.

Again, three times, one after the other, they were ducked, turned around, and grabbed again and again.

The children around me noticed the scene and their eyes widened in surprise.

<blank>

"Why ......, ......, .........!"

<blank>

Finally, Stefan is out of breath and breathing on his shoulders.

<blank>

What... what?"

<blank>

Suzy tilts her head and asks back.

<blank>

"Oh, my God, why? So, so much! My hair ......... is bright red!"

<blank>

He yelled at Suzy with red cheeks.

<blank>

Susie gently cupped Stefan's face ...... cheeks between her hands and brought her face close to his.

Stefan groans.

Susie after bringing them so close together that their noses almost touch.

<blank>

Why...?"

<blank>

He tilted his head and turned a spilling smile to Stefan.

<blank>

Boom! Stefan, who turned so red he thought he heard a pop!　He shook Susie's hand and ran out of the classroom.

<blank>

Oh, ha-ha-ha?　and Suzy puts her hand on the back of her head and smiles shyly.

<blank>

<blank>

......Yes, did you see that?"

I was so impressed! Susie, you just took Stefan in stride!"

"Oh my, is that ......, or is that ...... that fell off?"

I knew you were used to dealing with children! Or should I say, boys?

I said, "No, it's not like that! That movement! What the hell was that?

Hmm?" Movement? I don't think he moved that much?"

I know! It felt like it was fluttering around!"

That's what's so great about it," he said! He said, "That's amazing! And his lower body on the chair didn't even move! That's the realm of a master!

"Hmmm...you're a martial artist, you see things differently than we do."

'Yeah, and ...... there's eyes in the back too... like? Like?"

You can't do that even if you could see behind you! Look at him! Even Irving's eyes are wide open and frozen. Look at him! I'm getting goosebumps!

'Hmmm! I think Irving is hardened about something different!"

'Oh, I was so jealous of ......, wasn't I?'

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Lunch was served together on the lawn on the south side of the school building.

<blank>

Both sides of Suzy were dominated by two underclassmen who had missed her all morning.

Leila Carter and Mabel Beaumont.

The two of them were all over each other, "Sue-chan, Sue-chan, Sue-chan.

<blank>

Can I call you Sue too?"

<blank>

Mia asked me if I was okay, and I said, "Sure! I'm in! I was fixed with "Sue" by all of them.

<blank>

While eating, I suddenly noticed a small animal riding on Beatrice's shoulder.

<blank>

(Huh? A house mouse? Is it a big one for a ...... hamster? A white hamster? But it's got a big tail.)

<blank>

They are about 12 to 3 centimeters long, and if you include their tails, they can be as long as 30 centimeters.

That white rat is on Beatrice's shoulder, getting food from her and eating with her.

I asked Beatrice what that was.

<blank>

Hmm? This girl? His name is Algernon! He's my follower! He's very smart!

Too smart to be put out of the classroom for an exam, though!"

He's smarter than Bibi, so he'll answer for him."

I'm not! That's not true!"

<blank>

Algernon, perhaps understanding such a conversation, looks at Suzy and twitches his nose.

It's as if he's saying, "I know who you are.

Suddenly, Algernon slid off Beatrice's shoulder and came straight toward Suzy.

He climbs up to her shoulder without hesitation and sniffs her ear.

<blank>

"Ooohhhhh."

<blank>

I cringed and shrank back in surprise.

Algernon circled around his shoulder several times, then squeaked over his shoulder at Suzy and went straight back to Beatrice.

<blank>

Oh," he said! You came to say hi? I think this girl likes you!"

<blank>

After all, it seems that even the beasts miss him.

<blank>

In the afternoon, we're splitting up into practical training with swords and spears and a study group on magic.

<blank>

Beatrice asked me when everyone had finished eating.

<blank>

It doesn't matter which one you do, okay? Everyone does what they're good at! Some kids switch it up depending on the day! It's up to you to decide what you want to do!"

<blank>

(Hoho, is it similar to a club or club activities? Voluntary participation? I bet there are no kids who skip school. I heard that people in this village value strength, including children. Well, since they live by the side of a dangerous forest, weakness is a life-threatening situation, so it's only natural for them to protect themselves. ......

What should I do? (Sword training seems like fun since everyone is so energetic, but for now, maybe magic? (It would be nice to know how magic works here.)

<blank>

I want to know... magic... shiri-shiri-itai...!

Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

<blank>

Dana, who had been staring at Suzy with sparkling eyes, voiced her dissatisfaction.

<blank>

Why? Someone who can move so well is magic! That's a waste of time! Let's have a meeting together, Sue!

<blank>

Ugh!　My body is pulled back. I was a little overwhelmed by Dana coming at me with her hands.

<blank>

Dana, I know you're disappointed, but don't embarrass Sue. I know you're disappointed, but don't embarrass Sue, okay?"

<blank>

Colin looks up and alerts Dana with a quick lift of his finger on his glasses.

<blank>

"Ugh! I don't mean to embarrass you, but ......

"Sue, can you handle a sword or something?"

I'll... use... it?

But you don't practice swordsmanship?"

I want to learn... magic... how... to... calm... down... and... do... training... for... the... right... thing...!"

Really? I thought I would have to choose the magic class. So you'll come to me for training when you have a break in your magic studies, right?"

<blank>

I nodded my head in agreement with Dana.

<blank>

I'm sorry we can't meet today, but we'll be able to do it together soon, right?"

I'll do my best!

<blank>

I'll do my best to study magic and go for sword training," he said!　and he showed both fists clenched in a tight grip as he looked at Dana.

<blank>

Thanks! I'm so glad! Sue!!!"

<blank>

With a gabbaa, Dana hugged me. My face was buried in her chest and for a moment I couldn't breathe.

<blank>

Aaaaahhhh! Already! I knew Sue was cute! You're sooooooo cute!

<blank>

Dana gives me a hug with more wassailing.

<blank>

Abiyab!!!"

Oh, God! Oh, Dana! You can't have it all to yourself!

<blank>

Colin is going to get Susie back from Dana, and I'm going to get Susie, too! I'm in!　and the two younger children also clung to Suzy.

<blank>

Colin was able to take Suzy from Dana, but the two omakes came with him, and he was crushed under the weight of the three of them.

<blank>

Dana takes Suzy back again and the three of them swing her around together.

Layla and Mabel both cackle with delight, and Suzy's eyes are whirling around in circles.

<blank>

Mia, watching, muttered to herself, "I'm going to hug her a lot later!　Beatrice is fired up.

<blank>

A long, quiet lunchtime passes by.
