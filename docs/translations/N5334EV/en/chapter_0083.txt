# Chapter 78 Epilogue: Suzy Cloud's Delivery

This is the second post of the day.

If you haven't read the previous final chapter, please start there~

----------------

As we pass the early days of the second month of the red moon, the weather becomes quite warm.

In just two months, it will be a year since I came to this world, which feels a bit nostalgic.

I wonder if I will start to feel the arrival of summer by then?

<b>

The last time I came to Coop Town, I wore a thick coat, but today it is warm enough that I don't need a jacket.

Next week, Colin and Dana will have their entrance exams.

I really hope they do their best. Especially Dana! Yes!

I am reminded once again that time flies no matter where you are.

<b>

Papa Howard's health still doesn't seem to be returning anytime soon.

I think it will take a while for his etheric body to stabilize as it once was.

Until then, Papa needs to rest well and focus on his recovery.

<b>

He has already made Sonia Mama worry so much!

Of course, work is strictly prohibited!

At the very least, please let Sonia Mama take care of him for a month!!

<b>

For that reason, I have come to Coop Town in place of Papa Howard.

He really wanted to deliver it himself, but since he can't move right now, it can't be helped.

Still, with the desire to hand it over as soon as possible, I ended up delivering it on his behalf.

<b>

I have already delivered it to Marsh's workshop.

What I delivered was a mithril magic wand. It is about the length of a hand-held baton.

It is slightly larger than the type used in the school's magic research club.

It looks a bit scratched and slightly dented, and it seems to be slightly bent in places.

<b>

Marsh, upon receiving it, widened his eyes in surprise.

<b>

"......I see............ so this was here... I see............"

<b>

Saying that, he continued to gaze at it, placed on the desk, for a long time.

<b>

This wand, it seems, was something Marsh made himself when he had just become a full-fledged magician, using materials he prepared himself.

<b>

I quietly left the workshop, asking Marie Bell to take care of the silent Marsh.

<b>

<b>

Yes, on that day, several items were recovered from Kuroiwa.

I was asked to deliver them to those in need.

<b>

Indeed, items imbued with feelings should be returned to those who poured their feelings into them...

<b>

<b>

Speaking of items!

It seems that cursed item has turned into quite a situation.

<b>

Before Irta brought that cursed object to the temple, there was a brief moment when he arrived in the village and reported to August. During that time, Clark from the administrative side, I think? That person took it out alone and left the village.

Apparently, he said that delivering it to the royal capital as soon as possible was his duty or something...

That kind of dangerous object shouldn't be touched by amateurs...

<b>

In the end, it seems it was discovered in a very unfortunate manner in a town called Masomu, which is located beyond Coop Town. Masomu was once a post town for entering the old Amukam territory and still serves as a customs-like role when entering and exiting the Amukam region.

...There, it was found in a very unfortunate state.

<b>

There, it seems that, probably... it seems that the representative of the Fourier delegation was also present.

The reason I say probably is that... only the remains were found.

<b>

...Well, if that thing started moving, it would end up like that...

It's a very unfortunate result, but fortunately, it seems that the tragedy was contained to the room where the Fourier representatives were.

After that, the cursed object was quickly recovered and is said to be under strict sealing and management by the temple office.

<b>

It's unfortunate for the Fourier representatives and Clark, but I'm really glad that the situation didn't escalate further.

<b>

<b>

In the meantime, I arrived at another destination.

<b>

Peeking inside from the storefront, I could immediately see someone organizing the products.

Then, that person quickly noticed me and smiled.

<b>

"Oh? Miss Cloud! Welcome! What brings you here today? Alone?"

"Yes. I came to deliver something today."

"Oh? For me? What could it be?"

<b>

With her usual charming smile, Cecily, the shopkeeper with beautiful brunette hair that reaches her waist, walked over to me.

Yes, the person I am delivering to is Cecily.

<b>

When I offered her the small package, Cecily looked a bit puzzled but quickly accepted it.

Then, she opened the cloth that was wrapped around it and widened her eyes at what was revealed.

<b>

"That is, what Howard said would be best for you to have."

<b>

What came out from the cloth was an old bangle.

<b>

"...........So, the head has... no, Howard has returned? Conrad and Gilbert too?"

<b>

With a slightly trembling voice, Cecily asked while keeping her gaze down on the bangle.

<b>

"Yes, everyone is safe."

<b>

Cecily was also one of those who had formed a party with Papa Howard in the past.

<b>

"Those guys... they said they couldn't show me his figure, right? ...How foolish, isn't it?"

<b>

That bangle was something Cecily had given to Roland long ago.

I know what it means for a woman to give a bangle to a man in Amukam.

Cecily tightly grasped the bangle in her hand and looked up.

<b>

"Really... men are really all fools..."

<b>

Still looking up, Cecily murmured that.

<b>

"Thank you, Miss Cloud... for delivering it... and for bringing him back..."

<b>

I deeply bowed to Cecily, who said that, and quietly left the shop.

<b>

The sunlight was warm, and the gentle breeze carried a soothing calm through the town.

Spring is already in full swing.

Thank you for always reading!

This concludes Chapter 2.

<b>

After this, I will gradually post interludes and then take some time before starting Chapter 3.

<b>

Chapter 3 will be the academy arc!

I want to make it a fun school story!! (>Ï‰<)

I will expand the stage beyond just Amukam.

I will introduce various races!

And there will be no battles in Chapter 3! Not in Chapter 3!!

<b>

Ah, but is a school battle a theory?!

The theory is god!!

<b>

<b>

Thank you very much for your bookmarks and evaluations!

They definitely give me energy!!

<b>

Please continue to accompany Suzy from now on!!!

<b>

I will also post "Chapter 2 Characters" after this~
