# 78 Episode Epilogue Suzy Cloud's Delivery

This is the second post of the day.

If you haven't read the previous last episode, please start there~!

After the beginning of the red month of 2, the weather becomes much warmer.

It is a bit emotional to think that in two months, I will have been in this world for a year.

Will we begin to feel the arrival of summer by then?

<blank>

The last time I came to Copetown, I wore a heavy coat, but today it is warm enough that I don't need a jacket.

Next week we already have entrance exams for Colin and Dana.

I hope you two will please try your best to take on this challenge. Especially Dana! Duh!

I am reminded once again that time flies by, no matter where I am.

<blank>

Howard Papa's health is not likely to return for some time yet.

I think it will take a while for the etheric body to settle down like it did before.

Until then, Dad needs to rest and recuperate properly.

<blank>

You made Sonia-mama worry so much!

Work, etc. is naturally prohibited!

Please have Sonia-mama take care of them for at least a month!

<blank>

So now I am coming to Copetown on behalf of Howard's dad.

He really wanted to deliver it with his own hands, but he is stuck now, so he has no choice.

Even so, I wanted to deliver it as soon as possible, so I decided to deliver it on their behalf.

<blank>

I have already delivered them to Mr. Marsh's workshop.

What we delivered was a magic wand made by Mithril. The size of the wand is about the length of a hand-held tact.

They are a little larger than the type used in magic study groups at school.

It appears to be slightly dented or slightly bent due to scratches here and there.

<blank>

When Mr. Marsh received it, his eyes widened.

<blank>

"...... so ............, there was this ...... so ............"

<blank>

He said so and kept looking at it on his desk for a long time.

<blank>

This wand was made by Marsh when he was just starting out on his own, and he prepared the materials himself.

<blank>

I asked Mariebelle to take care of Marsh, who had fallen silent, and quietly left the workshop.

<blank>

<blank>

Yes, several items were recovered at Black Rock that day.

I was asked to deliver them to those in need.

<blank>

After all, an item that is filled with thought should be returned to the person who put the thought into it. ......

<blank>

<blank>

Speaking of items!

I heard that that cursed item was in serious trouble.

<blank>

Before Mr. Irta brought that cursed object to the temple, in the short time before he arrived in the village and raised his report to Mr. August, the clerk who returned with him, Mr. Clark ......, I think it was? He said that that person took it out alone and left the village.

He said that it was his duty to deliver them to the royal capital as soon as possible, or something like that. ......

That's not a dangerous thing for an amateur to touch. ......

<blank>

The town was once a gateway to the former Amkham territory and still serves as a customs post for people entering and leaving the Amkham region.

He was found there ...... in a very unfortunate way.

<blank>

I heard that the representative of the Fourier Mission was also there, probably ......, it seems.

The reason I say probably is that only the wreckage of ...... has been found.

<blank>

......Well, that's what happens when that thing starts moving. ......

A very unfortunate outcome, but fortunately, the tragedy was said to be limited to the room where the Houlihan representatives were located.

The story goes that the Temple Authority is in charge of the strict sealing and management of the cursed objects, which were promptly recovered afterwards.

<blank>

I'm sorry for Representative Houllier and Mr. Clark, but I'm very glad things didn't get any bigger than they were.

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, we arrived at another destination.

<blank>

When I peeked inside from the front of the store, I could immediately see the merchandise being organized.

Then Atira noticed me immediately and smiled at me.

<blank>

'Oh? Miss Cloud! Welcome! What's the matter with you today? Are you alone?"

"Yes, sir. I'm here today to deliver something.

"Oh? Me? What is it?"

<blank>

Cecily, the manager of "Late Afternoon," walked up to us with her charming smile as usual and shaking her beautiful brunette hair that reached her waist.

Yes, the person who will be delivering this to you is Cecily.

<blank>

When I presented the small package, Cecily looked a little puzzled, but immediately accepted it.

Then, he opened the cloth that had been wrapped around him, and his eyes widened when he saw the sole that had emerged from the cloth.

<blank>

Papa Howard said that it would be best if Cecily brought it with her.

<blank>

Out of the cloth came an old bangle.

<blank>

"............ so your head is ...... no, Howard's back, right? And Conrad and Gilbert?"

<blank>

With a slight tremor in her voice, Cecily asked me with her eyes down at her hand.

<blank>

Yes, everyone is safe.

<blank>

Cecily is one of the people who once partnered with Howard's father and his family.

<blank>

"They ...... said they couldn't let me see him, you know? ...... sounds stupid, doesn't it?"

<blank>

The bangle was a gift from Cecily to Roland a long time ago.

I know what it means for a woman to give a bangle to a man in Amkam.

Mr. Cecily squeezed the bangle in his hand and looked up!

<blank>

"Really ......, men are really all idiots ......."

<blank>

Cecily muttered as she looked up.

<blank>

"Thank you, Miss Cloud, for ....... Thank you ...... for delivering it and thank you ............ for sending it home."

<blank>

I bowed deeply to Cecily and quietly left the restaurant.

<blank>

The sunlight is warm and the wind carries a gentle calmness through the city.

Spring is already in full swing.

Thank you for reading!

This concludes Chapter 2.

<blank>

After this, I will drop the interval in bits and pieces, and after some time, I would like to start chapter 3.

<blank>

Chapter 3 is the school chapter!

I already want them to cackle at school stuff! (>Ï‰<)

<blank>

The stage on which only AMCAM has appeared up to now will be expanded outward.

We will produce a variety of species!

There are no battles in chapter 3, in chapter 3!

<blank>

Ah, but the school battle is the theory?

Theory is God, so!

<blank>

<blank>

Thank you so much for your buzz and rating!

We are definitely energized!

<blank>

Please stay with Suzy after this yet!

I'll also drop "Chapter 2 Characters" after this~!
