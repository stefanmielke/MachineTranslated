# Interlude 5 Flow, my tears, said Suzy.

Huh? That's funny. ...... You're over 10,000 words again? @@@


----------------

<blank>

This is the last summer that Colin and Dana will spend with Dana and her family in Amcam before they graduate from the village school and head to boarding school in Dekenbel.

That day, we were all out hunting in the woods.

<blank>

The members are Dana and Colin, as usual, and me, Bibi and Mia. Me, Bibi, Mia, and two underclassmen, Helena and Mary. And we added two underclassmen, Helena and Mary, for a total of seven upper-class girls.

<blank>

When the girls hunt together, we usually pair Dana and Colin, Helena and Bibi, and Mia and Mary at long range with me as their escort.

<blank>

The basic hunting setup is as follows: Algernon and Bibi scout a wide area, then strike the first shot at the prey they find to catch the enemy's eye, cut it down with a long-range attack, and finally finish it off with a big blow. ...... That's how they do it.

<blank>

Even now, Helena was ahead of Algernon, heading toward the prey he had spotted.

Helena, an excellent scout, quickly closed the distance between them without being noticed by her prey.

Her lovely strawberry blonde side-tail, bunched to her right, sways as Helena lowers herself and runs through the forest grass.

After Helena ran through, the grass shook finely as if a gentle breeze was blowing.

<blank>

Approaching her prey in a few moments, Helena does not hesitate to strike a dagger blow to its side and immediately backsteps away from it.

Piggy!　and a high-pitched cry echoed through the forest, and the prey, startled by the sudden pain, shook and shook its huge body, glaring with eight angry eyes at the little being ...... Helena who had caused it pain, moving the tentacle arm around its mouth in a menacing manner, while the jaws of its large mouth He rattled and clattered.

To keep Helena from taking evasive action, he quickly moves his eight long folded legs and turns around to cut off her retreat.

<blank>

The monster, a giant spider "Giant Spider," raised its voice and leaped toward Helena.

Its long, slender legs and huge abdomen are beautifully patterned in black and yellow.

It is truly a giant female spider. The bristly hair that fills its entire body adds to its exasperation! Gross! Quite gross!

<blank>

The Giant Spider pursues Helena with an agility that does not match its over 2-meter frame.

Helena went about her position exquisitely, skillfully handling the attacks of the demonic beasts.

<blank>

Just as the target's back was turned to us, arrows were fired in rapid succession from Mary's drawn bow.

The sound of several arrow blades cutting the wind as they run toward the giant spider is immediately followed by a dull thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud, thud.

<blank>

Mary's arrows were released one after another, piercing the thin legs of the giant spider. Her accuracy in hitting the target is still amazing!

The spider monster screamed on the spot, unable to stand properly and struck the earth.

The giant spider managed to lift its body up and clawed at the ground, but was immediately pierced by a number of spear-like tree roots rising up from the earth.

<blank>

At the same time that the tree roots lifted her body halfway up, Dana kicked the ground and sprinted toward the tree roots.

The Ki converged at the tip of the spear in Dana's hand emits a pale light.

The glow of "Ki" drew a trail of light, and Dana quickly closed the gap and drove her spear deep into the Giant Spider's chest.

<blank>

The body of the beast, pierced by Dana's spear, exploded from the inside, leaving a huge hole in its torso, and it collapsed without power on the spot.

<blank>

Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"

She said, "It's amazing! Sister Dana!"

Now that was some good, well-coordinated work, just like the pattern."

<blank>

Dana and Helena clapped their hands together in joy, and Colin praised everyone's standing.

<blank>

How's it going?" "What do you think, Sue? That move went in beautifully, didn't it?

Yeah, I think it was good, okay?"

<blank>

Dana beat her chest and asked me how well I was doing with my current technique.

To which I respond with a nod of my head.

<blank>

Dana just used a "power smash" type of hard-hitting skill.

In the past few months of training, Dana had acquired the skill of using "Ki".

Although there is still some unevenness in the way Ki is applied, its effectiveness in actual battle is lying right in front of us.

<blank>

Hee-hee! This won't get me into Irving any more!"

<blank>

Yes, Irving has already mastered the use of Ki.

For what it's worth, Irving has a good memory for things. He has a great sense of combat.

It seems that everyone in the Haggard family is like that. I guess that means they are not considered the heroic family of Amkam.

It seems to me that they have some heroic attributes, those brothers over there!

<blank>

Irving says that he is already experimenting with his own way of using it in actual battle.

But a little while ago I heard someone yell, "Irving Strasse! I heard him yelling, 'Irving Strassu!

I was pretty embarrassed just hearing about it, though, like putting my name in the technique! I can't help but be amused! I can't help but tsk tsk!

...... Well, my actual age is middle school age!

<blank>

I heard that you and Ryder are training in another part of the forest today, ......, and you're not calling out the name of some weird technique, are you?

You can be sure that it will be black history that will haunt you for years to come. Mr. Ryder, you better make sure you don't do that, okay?

<blank>

I sincerely hope Dana doesn't give the technique a funny name or anything like that. ......

<blank>

I'll name this technique 'Dana Dynamic'! Let's name this technique 'Dana Dynamic'!"

'It's so cool! Sister Dana!!!!"

<blank>

It was too late for ............. ......

Space cop? I'd like to say something like that!

Oh, but Colin is looking at Dana coldly. I'll leave Dana to Colin.

<blank>

And so everyone has learned to handle Ki in their own way.

Helena and Mary are also learning how to control Ki, although they are still unstable.

Recently, even the children of Bibi, Mia, and Korin's magic team have become able to handle Ki.

Maybe that's the effect, but it seems that everyone's aptitude attributes are increasing. ...... Well, I guess it's a good thing that everyone is going stronger! Duh!

<blank>

I want to be as cool and proficient as my sisters! I can't wait to be able to use my skills as coolly as my sisters!

Don't worry! Helena will be able to do it soon! Right? Sue!

Yes, hey ......!

<blank>

I nodded to Dana and Helena, pulled my throw-in knife from the knife sheath hanging from my waist, and threw it with great force at a mossy rock the size of a light car behind Mary at the end of the line.

<blank>

Algernon seemed to know something was lurking, but he couldn't place it. He was busy sniffing and sniffing.

Bibi noticed this and looked around without letting her guard down.

<blank>

With a "gurung! With a sound that cut through the atmosphere, the throw-in knife passed through Mary's side and cracked the large rock behind her in half with a dull thud.

The knife cuts through the rock as well as the beast that had attached itself to it and mimicked it.

<blank>

The one that was cut in half along with the rock was a magical beast called a "roegrail" with a grayish-white human brain marrow, a large black beak like a bird, and more than a dozen thin tentacles that seemed to split off from the extended spinal cord.

The threat value of this faceless demon is 5.

Yes, this guy is not like the magical beasts that inhabit the safe zone with a threat value of 1 or less.

The Giant Spider that Dana and his team just killed has a threat value of 3. It is not a safe-zone magical beast after all.

<blank>

This is outside the safe zone, about two kilometers from the village, in a forest called the "shallow layer.

<blank>

Normally, Helena and Mary, who are not in the class, as well as those of us who just finished the "ordeal" and became class members, would not be allowed to enter this place yet.

Dana and Colin will be enrolled in DeKembel's boarding school the month after next and will have their spiritual seal engraved early.

Only then will they gain the strength to fight, be recognized as the 1st in the Protectorate, and finally be able to challenge the "shallow layer". ......

<blank>

Apparently, the village children who have learned the skills using "Ki" that I teach are showing great power even before they are engraved with the spirit seal, and they are very upsetting the village council. ......

One day at dinner, Howard's dad told me about it with a big smile on his face and a great sense of enjoyment.

I was sweating profusely on my back the whole time I was listening to him!

Are you doing something wrong? Myself? And!

<blank>

Well, before I knew it, I had made an unspoken promise that even children without classes could enter the shallow layer of the forest to explore if they were under my supervision. This was an unspoken promise.

Apparently, they want me to train more and more children. ......

If you put it on me, you can expect further growth. ......

<blank>

Well, I don't use insane levels of power in front of everyone!

I'm in the battle along with everyone else, so I'm fully willing to be helpful!

<blank>

<blank>

I think I've improved a lot over the past year or so in limiting my ...... power.

I've been working on my own training in the woods at night! Duh! For a lot of things! Unh! Many things!

<blank>

It is a way to control the output, like turning a volume down or up, rather than turning a power switch on and off.

You can drop the level to 1 or 2 or whatever you can, and when you want to use it, you can increase the output as much as you want at once. ......

<blank>

But even if you think you've become able to do it through independent training, it's only subjective to you.

By hunting with others in this way, we can check the balance of power and get a bird's eye view of the state of control, and I think it will be possible to use the power that has been reduced to a level that is not noticeable to others!

It is for my own benefit and I am grateful to be able to work together with others deep in the forest!

I think this is an essential skill to have in order to someday be able to associate with people outside of Amcam! Duh!

<blank>

Even now, it's a knife thrower with the combined strength of all of us.

I think I had a good hold on my power, myself! Unh, unh!

<blank>

Helena will be able to do this, right?

<blank>

I turned to Helena and smiled at her with the biggest smile I had ever seen.

............ Huh? Helena's not responding very well, is she?

<blank>

"...... you know, you can't take that thing for granted, okay? It's not a person's domain, okay?"

<blank>

Hmm? What's Colin saying to Dana and Helena with a serious look on his face?

Dana and Helena are shaking their heads furiously, aren't they? Why on earth?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After that, we tried several ways of working together to defeat the demonic beasts.

Today, the sun is almost at the top of the sky, even though we were in the woods early this morning.

When we took a break a little while ago, everyone started complaining that they were hungry, even though they had neatly eaten the fruit sandwiches I had made for them.

Mainly Dana, though. ......

It felt like a picnic, even though we were in the shallow layer of the forest. It's a good time to pull out, isn't it?

<blank>

The hunt was going better than expected, so everyone is a little excited.

But that's when you have to be on your toes. It's a search until you get home!

<blank>

As expected, some people were caught flat-footed.

...... Well, it wasn't so much scooped up as it was stepped over. ......

<blank>

It was almost at the boundary of the safe zone, just a few more steps before the village, when we were almost at the border of the safe zone.

What appeared was an insect-type magical beast called "Little Mantillas.

<blank>

It is a large mantis-like beast with a very spiny appearance and large, yellow eyes.

It's about 1.5 meters long, so about the size of a large dog.

<blank>

The guy rattles his mouth and raises both scythes to threaten us.

Its threat value is 0.9.

<blank>

If a normal person meets him, he's sure to get stuck there.

The movement to capture prey is quick, like an insect.

If you were to get hit by such a big sickle, you'd be in big trouble.

Once you meet them, you can't run away from them and they can easily cut your body in half. They will probably chop you in half in an instant.

<blank>

But the people here now are not ordinary people. They are the children of AMCAM.

<blank>

Leave it to me."

<blank>

Helena was moving the moment she sighted the demonic beast.

By the time Little Mantillas began to threaten, he was already behind it and about to swing his knife.

The knife held in the opposite hand drew a beautiful trajectory, and the light seemed to be absorbed into the neck of the magical beast.

<blank>

Did Little Mantillas notice Helena at that time?

His face twitched, but his triangular head was airborne the next moment. It was a head chopper!

<blank>

I did it! Sister! It's a blow!

<blank>

Helena is shouting happily at me.

The current blow was well ridden with "Ki" and the "Blow" type skill that is performed with a knife was also activated.

The "Blow" system is a powerful skill with a single blow, but it often fails even if it is triggered.

If it fails, it will not do much damage, but if it decides, it can end the game with a single shot, as it is doing now.

It's a skill that has an exponential nature, but I'm happy when it's decided.

Helena was also happy, jumping up and down on the spot, her hair bouncing and swaying.

<blank>

However, they are a little quick to rejoice!

Insectivores are still able to move their bodies, even to the point of flying off their heads.

Little Mantillas' scythe extends to Helena in a straight line to reap her own enemies.

Helena quickly readied her knife and was able to guard it in time, but her momentum was unstoppable and she was sent flying strongly backward.

Little Mantillas continues to extend his scythe to Helena as if he can see her, despite the fact that she has lost her appearance.

<blank>

But there, Dana speared Little Mantillas from above.

Little Mantillas' body is sewn to the ground with a spear, like an insect specimen.

Furthermore, Mia's magic "Roots Needle," which she finished chanting late, caused several tree roots to grow up from the ground, piercing through the body of Little Mantis, this time putting an end to it.

<blank>

Helena, who had been shot off, twisted and turned her body as an evasive maneuver, mitigating the impact of the bullet and keeping her distance from the demonic beast.

The sharpness of their movements is so brilliant that it is like watching a floor exercise performance.

Brilliant, but that landing is not good. Not only that, but it is a place where you should not land!

At that time, I had already left everyone who was going to challenge the beast and was running toward Helena.

<blank>

My spotting showed me what was there!

Even though I was pushing myself to the minimum, I could still make it at this distance.

<blank>

Helena's foot, which she thought had reached the ground, stepped through the grass and sank into the ground as if it were a pit or something.

Helena's eyes widened as she did not feel the impact of the landing and even more so as her body fell into the ground.

<blank>

My hand reaches Helena's waist.

He held Helena's body as it was, but the two gained momentum and ended up plunging through a large hole in the ground.

The surface of the earth was gouged out, exposing a cavity that had been hidden underground.

<blank>

It was a small hollow.

It is only two to three meters in diameter and less than one meter deep.

If they fall, they won't get hurt.

But the guy in the middle of it is the problem.

<blank>

Red Wings.

Among the soft-bodied magical beasts of the ooze family, this species has relatively strong dissolving power.

<blank>

Ooze often clump together in one place and form colonies that nurture themselves, taking in decaying leaves, plants, insects, and small animals around them.

They are called "ooze pools" and are rarely seen in valleys and depressions, but this time, it seems that they were formed underground.

They were dissolving the roots of soil, plants, and trees underground, creating colonies as they expanded their cavities there.

And at the bottom of that hole is a pond of red ooze!

<blank>

The dissolving power of the lower ooze species is not a threat to humans. However, "red oozes" can cause a certain amount of damage to human skin.

If you drop it in such a puddle, it will burn Helena's ball skin!

I was going to leave the place with Helena in my arms, but I stepped over the ground!

<blank>

In short, we had too much momentum!

<blank>

I took Helena in my arms and slipped straight into the ooze colony.

Yes, I landed butt-first in the Pond of Ooze! I landed on the pond of ooze, butt first!

<blank>

Immediately, the sticky texture of the ooze was felt on my buttocks, and then the feeling of the ooze wriggling around was spreading from my buttocks to my inner thighs!



<blank>

Pinyamiaaaaahhhh!"

"Oh, sissy mia mia mia?!"

<blank>

With all the hairs on my body standing on end, I screamed inaudibly, and with Helena in my arms, I leaped from there to about 20 meters up in the air at once.

And just like that, without thinking, he shoots down his magic towards the pond of ooze.

<blank>

《Fire Strike》

It is not spirit magic learned in this land, but our own magic that does not require celebration.

Even though it was initial magic with its own control level reduced, its power was nothing compared to spirit magic.

The small mass of flame that was shot out shot through the ooze colony, exceeding the speed of sound.

The swarms of oozes evaporate instantaneously, and the flaming bullets that pierce deep into the depressions dissolve the soil and quickly bring the earth to a boil.

<blank>

Nah! What the hell?

"Sue-chan? What? Sue-chan?

Bibi! The wall! Come on!

Ro, Rock Wall!!!!"

<blank>

Bibi and the others were in a bit of a panic when they saw lava erupting from the ground, albeit only slightly, less than 10 meters away.

Dana, who was in the lead, was blown away by the hot wind that suddenly erupted from the depression, and immediately, Colin sent an instruction to Bibi to create a barrier to deflect the hot wind.

<blank>

By the time Mary ran up to Dana, who had been rolled by the rumbling hot wind, I had already descended from the sky to the ground.

However, even though I was holding Helena carefully, I could not bear the ozozoic sensation that clung to my lower body, and I just kept sobbing on my knees there and then.

<blank>

What? Sue? Eh? Ooze? Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute! I'll wash you right away!

<blank>

Mia noticed me landing immediately and the ooze clinging to my lower body and used "water" to wash it all away clean.

Helena, whom I was holding, was unable to withstand the G-force when I jumped up into the sky in an instant, and seemed to have blacked out as it was.

<blank>

Colin was holding Helena, and Dana was holding me as I continued to raise my voice, and they all headed for the One's stuffing station at once.

<blank>

I'm going to say, "Aanya. ...... Inya! Inyaaaaaa! Hiinyaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"

<blank>

Yes! I had lost all human language at that time, because of the ouzo sensation that struck this maiden!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh my gosh, this is terrible. ......"

<blank>

Colin picked up the rag-like piece and muttered with a sigh.

<blank>

Uh-uh ......, uh-uh ...... uh-uh ......."

'Oh, it's okay, Sue! I'm already coming clean!"

I'm going to get some new towels!"

I'll be there! I'm coming too! I'm going to get another tub of clean water!

<blank>

Helena and Mary opened the door and left the room in a great hurry, slamming it shut.

<blank>

This is the first meeting room of the One's stuffing room.

Dana carried me to Coco, where everyone was removing some of my clothes that had been torn to shreds by the ooze.

Helena, who had been unconscious, has recovered and is already feeling better, as you can see.

<blank>

I have regained some of my composure, but I still can't get rid of that ozo feeling. ...... It's more than that, it's this current situation...

I was on the table in the conference room, shaking and shaking a little, while Colin and Mia removed the debris from around my buttocks.

Bibi exhaled as if to say, "Oh dear," and wrung out several towels.

Algernon runs from one foot to the other.

Don't look up at my feet, little animal ...... I'll trample you down, won't I?

<blank>

Why are we doing this in the conference room? .......

There was actually a women's locker room in this Tsumesho, but the wall was torn down for some reason the other day, and it is currently under repair and not in working condition.

Until repairs are completed, this room is used as the women's changing room, and when it is used, a "Women in use" tag is hung on the conference room doorknob for the women to use when they change their clothes.

There are a lot of men in the stuffing room, but they are all pure gentlemen at heart, so there are no suicidal people who would open the door where this tag is hanging.

Amcam women are so scary!

<blank>

So, what Colin, Mia and Bibi are removing now is, in essence, the ...... end result of my underwear. ......

<blank>

The red ooze I jumped into has strong dissolving power, but not enough to do anything to human skin in an instant.

And there was no way they could melt equipment made from the leather of a magical beast.

So the black leather mini and over-the-knee boots made of Hexenbiest's leather were taken care of, but not so with the si-high socks and underwear and underwear, which are made of just fabric ...... and are raggedy to look at.

So now I am sitting at the table with my hands on the table, my bare feet with my boots off and my butt sticking out, while everyone else is picking up the remnants of the cloth!

Ahhhhhh ......, what an outfit! Siksik .......

What? You think a vigorous stream of water will wash it away?

Because the melted fibers are stuck to the skin! Colin said that peeling them off one by one by hand is faster and cleaner than running water and scrubbing! That's why I'm getting my butt out of my ass and having everyone else take them off for me! Shikshikshikshikku .......

I burned up all the pieces that digested and absorbed my underwear in a clean incineration! I did it, though!

<blank>

AnnaMarie, who had been waiting for our return at the packing house, immediately went back to her house to get a change of underwear as soon as she learned of my condition.

Helena and Mary left the room to wipe off the wreckage, which was still quite sticky and looked like dirt, and to take good care of the rest of it.

I finally started to feel a little more relaxed enough to realize that I must be worrying them both to leave in such a big hurry .......

<blank>

"Oh, oh, I'm blushing, aren't I?"

<blank>

As soon as I calmed down, I couldn't help but wonder about that. Like a monkey's butt, I guess. Like .......

<blank>

'Don't worry, Sue! You look lovely as always!"

<blank>

Mia told me this as she dropped the rags around me that were still left.

And gradually, the realization that I am in a state of considerable embarrassment grows louder and louder.

There are quite a few people on the other side of the door, and I wonder how I am dressed!

<blank>

"Ta, towel ...... yet? Still?"

<blank>

As I reached out with one hand to pull down the hem of my very rolled-up mini, I saw out of the corner of my eye that a nimble-looking Dana was coming up to me.

But more than that, I couldn't help but feel a shiver as I noticed a presence heading this way.

Huh? Eh? Isn't he heading straight for this room as usual while talking?

This room is on the north side of Tsumesho, at the end of a straight corridor.

This room is the only one at the end of that corridor!

No, but there's a "in use" tag on it! But it's tagged "in use", right? You wouldn't open the door, would you? It usually stops, doesn't it?

<blank>

"Which one? Is this the cute one?"

<blank>

Dana, who had a really nice smile on her face, approached me and reached between Colin and Mia, who were taking the rags off their hips and thighs, and easily rolled up the whole mini into a neat perorinpulungu!

Dana's heinous act and the sound of the two men talking could be heard directly in the room at the exact same time!

<blank>

So! Is Irving blind to his surroundings, ...... et ......?"

'Wait a minute bro! Was that a little more ......? ......are?"

<blank>

He opened the door!

<blank>

And time stops. ！！！！

<blank>

At that time, I think I looked like a haniwa (clay figurine) doing Munch's cry!

As he inhaled, he said, "Heeeeeeeee!!!!" He shouted! Is it a pull scream?

<blank>

Colin, who was at my side, turned toward the door with a startled look on his face and open mouth, instantly lowering the hem of his mini as if to shut it down with no look.

<blank>

Wait a minute! I'm sorry! This is a mistake, this is a mistake, I don't see anything, I don't see anything, it's okay! It's a white mo......!

<blank>

It was a moment.

For a moment, Mr. Ryder was spouting long-winded excuses in less than three seconds, and Irving was staring at him with his eyes peeled back, not saying a word.

At the moment my brain was overheating and about to erupt steam from my ears with great force!

<blank>

A gurgling ...... and winded corkscrew shot into the middle of Mr. Ryder's face. The parts of his face, which had been dignified and well-defined, swirled around his fist and dug into the back of it.

Mia's left fist was launched in this instant, and it successfully shot the Devagame rider in the face!

By that time, Bibi's right fist was already in Devagame's brother's face as well.

<blank>

Don't be gun-shy ！！！！！."

<blank>

The cries of Mia and Bibi echoed around the area.

The two men were shot with fists, and together they rolled grandly down the long corridor, breaking through the wall at the end of the corridor and blasting outward.

<blank>

Damn it! I underestimated those brothers!

This is why the Haggards are heroes!

I never thought I would fall prey to a lucky scheme!

I should have been more alert when I noticed those two approaching here!

<blank>

Afterwards, I was the one who raised an inarticulate cry that echoed throughout the stuffy room!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The tag that was hanging on the door apparently came off and fell down when Helena and Mary rushed out.

Along with the ooze, Helena cried and clung to me and apologized, but ......, no, it's not Helena's fault, it's not her fault, okay?

Then I gently stroked Helena's head.

<blank>

The bad guys are the Ooze and, you know, ...... those Devagame brothers!

Also, ...... Dana!

I glanced Dana up and down with that and she turned her head to the side and started whistling a whistle that didn't sound!

Showa! Does this guy know what Showa taste is? It's too goofy!

<blank>

Either way, I won't talk to you!　I turned my head to the side and showed Koch, and Dana clung to me and apologized, crying too.

And even more, they were squishy and snuggly in various places!

Oh, oh, you're not going to apologize, are you? Dana! You're just fulfilling your own desires, aren't you!

Shortly thereafter, Dana was being knocked over the back of her head by Colin with great force. Well, of course!

<blank>

<blank>

I heard that Howard's father went out somewhere that night wearing Ultimate equipment, but I had no knowledge of it!

<blank>

In addition, ...... that summer, whenever ooze was found in the forest of Amkamu, a pillar of fire somehow started to rise in that area. ...... is a totally unnecessary afterthought!



<blank>

----------------

Thank you for reading!

<blank>

I just wanted to write a lucky story.
