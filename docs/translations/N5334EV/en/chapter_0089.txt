# Interlude 5: "Flow, My Tears," Said Suzy

Huh? That's strange... It's over 10,000 characters again? @@

----------------

<b>

Colin and Dana are graduating from the village school and spending their last summer with the Amukam before heading to Dekember's boarding school.

On that day, we all went hunting in the forest together.

<b>

The members were the usual Dana and Colin, me, Vivi, and Mia. And we added two underclassmen, Helena and Mary, making it seven upperclassmen girls.

<b>

When the girls go hunting, we usually pair Dana and Colin, Helena and Vivi, while I act as a guard for the long-range attackers, Mia and Mary.

<b>

The basic hunting procedure involves Algernon and Vivi scouting a wide area, striking the prey first to draw its attention, then chipping away at it with ranged attacks, and finally delivering a finishing blow with a powerful strike... That's how we usually do it.

<b>

Even now, Helena was advancing towards the prey spotted by Algernon.

Helena, an excellent scout, closed the distance without alerting the prey.

With her lovely strawberry-blonde side tail swaying to the right, Helena ran low through the grass of the forest.

The underbrush that Helena passed through swayed gently, as if a breeze had blown through.

<b>

In no time, Helena approached the prey and, without hesitation, struck it with a dagger to its side, immediately taking a back step to create distance.

With a high-pitched scream that echoed through the forest, the prey was startled by the sudden pain, shaking its massive body and glaring at the small creature that inflicted the pain... Helena, with its eight eyes filled with anger, glared at her, moving its mouthparts in a threatening manner while snapping its large jaws.

To prevent Helena from escaping, it quickly moved its folded long legs to cut off her retreat.

<b>

The magical beast, a giant spider known as "Giant Spider," let out an even louder scream and lunged at Helena.

Its long, slender legs and massive abdomen were beautifully patterned in black and yellow.

It was truly a giant tarantula. The coarse hairs covering its body only added to its grotesqueness! Gross! Really gross!!

<b>

The Giant Spider pursued Helena with surprising agility, despite its body exceeding two meters.

Helena skillfully dodged the beast's attacks while positioning herself perfectly.

<b>

Just as the target turned its back to us, arrows were released in rapid succession from Mary's drawn bow.

The sound of multiple arrow fletchings slicing through the air raced towards the giant spider, followed by a dull thud as they struck something.

<b>

Mary's arrows pierced the giant spider's thin legs one after another. Her accuracy was as impressive as ever!

The spider let out a scream and could no longer stand, collapsing to the ground.

The giant spider struggled to lift its body, but was immediately pierced by several spear-like roots that shot up from the ground.

<b>

With its massive body half suspended by the roots, Dana kicked off the ground and charged towards it.

The "ki" converged at the tip of Dana's spear, emitting a faint glow.

The light of the "ki" traced a path as Dana closed the distance and thrust her spear deep into the giant spider's chest.

<b>

The body of the magical beast pierced by Dana's spear burst apart as if it had exploded from within, creating a large hole in its torso, and it crumpled to the ground lifelessly.

<b>

"Yessss!!!"

"That was amazing, Dana-neechan!!"

"That was a perfectly coordinated attack!"

<b>

Dana and Helena high-fived in joy, while Colin praised everyone's performance.

<b>

"How was that, Su? That technique was beautifully executed, right?!"

"Yeah, I think it was good, right?"

<b>

Dana puffed out her chest and asked for feedback on her technique.

I nodded in agreement.

<b>

What Dana just used was a powerful strike skill from the "Power Smash" category.

Over the past few months of training, Dana had learned to use "ki."

Although her control over "ki" still had some inconsistencies, its effectiveness in battle was evident.

<b>

"Hehe! With this, I won't lose to Arvin anymore!"

<b>

That's right, Arvin had already mastered the use of "ki."

Despite everything, Arvin has a good memory. His combat sense is exceptional.

It seems that everyone from the Haggard family is like that. They aren't called the heroic family of Amukam for nothing.

They probably have some hero attributes too, those siblings!

<b>

Arvin seems to be experimenting with his own methods in actual combat already.

But not long ago, I overheard him shouting "Arvin Strash!" or something!

Just hearing him put his name into a technique made me feel incredibly embarrassed! Seriously, is he in his second year of middle school or what?! I couldn't help but retort!

...Well, his actual age is middle school level, though!!

<b>

I heard he's training with Rider in another part of the forest today, but... I hope he's not shouting out weird technique names?

In a few years, I can guarantee he'll be rolling around in embarrassment over that black history, right? Rider, please make sure to stop him!

<b>

I sincerely hope Dana doesn't give any weird names to her techniques...

<b>

"Alright! Let's name this technique 'Dana Dynamic'!"

"That's cool, Dana-neechan!!"

<b>

...It was too late...

Is she a space cop or something?! I just want to retort!

Oh, but Colin is giving Dana a cold look. Yeah, I'll leave Dana to Colin.

<b>

And so, everyone has been learning to handle "ki" to some extent.

Helena and Mary are still a bit unstable, but they're starting to grasp how to control "ki."

Recently, even Vivi, Mia, and Colin's magic group have started to learn how to handle "ki."

Perhaps as a result, everyone's affinity attributes seem to be increasing... Well, I think it's a good thing that everyone is getting stronger! Yes!

<b>

"Ah! I want to use techniques as cool as you all do, soon!!"

"Don't worry! Helena will be able to do it in no time! Right, Su?"

"Yeah, that's right...!!"

<b>

I nodded at Dana and Helena while pulling out a throwing knife from the sheath at my waist and throwing it with force towards a moss-covered rock the size of a small car behind Mary, who was at the back of the line.

<b>

Algernon seemed to sense something lurking but couldn't pinpoint its location, sniffing around busily.

Noticing this, Vivi kept her guard up, scanning the surroundings.

<b>

With a whoosh that sliced through the air, the throwing knife zipped past Mary's side and struck the large rock with a dull thud, splitting it in two.

The knife sliced through the magical beast that had been camouflaged alongside the rock.

<b>

The creature that was split with the rock was called "Rogue Rail," a magical beast with a grayish-white human brain, a bird-like large black beak, and several thin tentacles branching from its elongated spinal cord.

This faceless demon has a threat level of 5.

Yes, this is different from the magical beasts that inhabit the safe zone, which have a threat level below 1.

Earlier, the Giant Spider that Dana and the others took down also had a threat level of 3. It is indeed not a magical beast from the safe zone.

<b>

This is outside the safe zone, about 2 kilometers from the village, in a forest known as the "Shallow Layer."

<b>

Under normal circumstances, neither Helena nor Mary, who are without a class, nor us, who have just completed our "trial" and obtained classes, would be allowed to enter this area.

Dana and Colin will be entering Dekember's boarding school next month and will soon have their spirit seals engraved.

Only then will they gain the power to fight, be recognized as 1st class in the civil guard, and finally be able to challenge the "Shallow Layer"...

<b>

However, it seems that the village children who learned the skills using "ki" that I taught them are demonstrating significant power even before having their spirit seals engraved, which has greatly shaken the village council...

One evening during dinner, Papa Howard told me this with great amusement while laughing heartily.

I was sweating profusely while listening to that story!

Am I causing trouble?! Myself?!

<b>

Well, somehow, an unspoken agreement has been established that even children without classes can explore the shallow layer of the forest under my supervision.

It seems they want me to train the children even more...

They believe that if they leave it to me, further growth can be expected...

<b>

Well, I assure you, I haven't been using an unreasonable level of power in front of everyone!

I've been participating in battles at a level that suits everyone, so it's perfectly fine for them to use me as a reference!!

<b>

<b>

...I think I've improved quite a bit at controlling my power over the past year.

I've been diligently training in the forest at night! Yes! Various things! Yes! Various things!!

<b>

It's not about turning the power switch on and off, but rather controlling the output by adjusting the volume.

I can drop my level to 1 or 2, as low as possible, and then ramp up the output as I wish when I want to use it... That's the idea.

<b>

But even if I think I've gotten good at it through self-training, it's still just my subjective view.

By hunting with everyone like this, I can check the balance of my power and observe my control from a broader perspective, allowing me to use a level of power that doesn't stand out to others!

Acting together in the depths of the forest is beneficial for me as well, and I'm grateful for it!

I believe this is an essential skill for interacting with people outside of Amukam someday! Yes!!

<b>

Even now, I'm throwing knives with a power that matches everyone.

I think I managed to keep my power in check quite well! Yes, yes!

<b>

"Helena can do this much too, right?"

<b>

I turned to Helena and smiled brightly.

...Huh? Helena's reaction seems a bit lacking?

<b>

"...I think you understand, but you shouldn't take that as the norm, okay? That's not within the realm of humans, you know?"

<b>

Hmm? Colin is saying something serious to Dana and Helena?

Dana and Helena are nodding vigorously. What on earth is going on?

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

After that, we defeated several magical beasts while trying out various coordinated attacks.

Even though we had entered the forest early in the morning, the sun was already nearing its zenith.

When we took a break a little while ago, we had polished off the fruit sandwiches I made, and now everyone was starting to complain about being hungry.

Mainly Dana, though...

Even though we were in the shallow layer of the forest, it felt like a complete picnic. Is it a good time to head back?

<b>

The hunting had gone better than expected, so everyone was a bit hyped up.

But it’s precisely at such times that we need to stay alert. The exploration isn't over until we return!

<b>

As expected, someone tripped.

...Well, it was more like they stepped wrong...

<b>

Just as we were about to reach the boundary of the safe zone, a little before we got back to the village, a magical beast appeared called "Little Mantis."

<b>

It looked like a large mantis with a lot of spikes all over its body, yellow with big eyes standing out.

Its body length was about 1.5 meters, so it was roughly the size of a large dog.

<b>

It clicked its mandibles and raised its scythes to threaten us.

Its threat level is 0.9.

<b>

If an ordinary person encountered it, it would be a guaranteed loss.

Its movements to capture prey are quick, just like an insect.

If you got hit by those huge scythes, you wouldn't stand a chance.

Once you meet it, there's no escape, and your body would be easily sliced in half. You'd probably lose your head in an instant.

<b>

But the ones here now are not ordinary people. They are the children of Amukam.

<b>

"Leave it to me."

<b>

Helena was already in motion the moment she spotted the magical beast.

By the time the Little Mantis began its intimidation, she had already circled behind it and was swinging her knife.

The knife held in her reverse grip traced a beautiful arc as it headed towards the beast's neck, the light seemingly being absorbed into it.

<b>

Did the Little Mantis notice Helena at that moment?

It twitched its triangular head, but the next moment, its head was flying through the air. Decapitated!

<b>

"I did it! One hit, Onee-sama!!"

<b>

Helena exclaimed happily towards me.

Her strike was perfectly infused with "ki," activating the "Blow" skill with her knife.

The "Blow" skill is powerful, but it often fails to activate.

If it fails, it won't deal much damage, but if it succeeds, it can end the fight in one blow like just now.

It's a gamble of a skill, but it's exhilarating when it works.

Helena was bouncing with joy, shaking her hair.

<b>

However, it was a bit premature to celebrate!

Insect-type creatures can still move even after their heads are cut off.

The Little Mantis's scythe lunged straight towards Helena, trying to reap its enemy.

Helena managed to prepare her knife in time to guard, but the force was too strong, and she was violently knocked back.

Even without a face, the Little Mantis continued to extend its scythe towards Helena as if it could still see her.

<b>

But then, Dana thrust her spear down from above into the Little Mantis.

The Little Mantis's body was pinned to the ground as if it were an insect specimen.

Furthermore, Mia's magic, "Root Needle," which she had just finished chanting, caused several roots to shoot up from the ground, piercing through the Little Mantis's body and finally finishing it off.

<b>

Helena, who had been knocked back, twisted her body to perform an evasive maneuver, rotating to mitigate the impact and distancing herself from the magical beast.

Her fluid movements were reminiscent of a floor exercise, making it look very graceful.

It was graceful, but her landing was not acceptable. More like, that was not a place to land!

At that moment, I had already leaped towards Helena, leaving everyone else to face the magical beast.

<b>

My scouting had revealed the creature lurking in that spot!

Even though I had minimized my power, I was still able to reach her in time at this distance.

<b>

Helena's feet, which she thought had landed, instead sank into the ground as if she had stepped into a pitfall.

She didn't feel the impact of landing and widened her eyes in shock as her body sank into the ground.

<b>

My hand reached Helena's waist.

I grabbed her and, with the momentum, we both plunged into the ground, creating a large hole.

The surface was dramatically gouged out, revealing a cavity hidden underground.

<b>

It was a small cavity.

It was about 2 to 3 meters in diameter and less than a meter deep.

Falling in wouldn't cause any injury.

However, the problem was what was inside.

<b>

"Red Ooze"

Among the ooze-type magical beasts, it is a species with relatively strong dissolving power.

<b>

Ooze types often gather in one place, incorporating surrounding leaf litter, plants, insects, and small animals to form a colony.

This is known as an "ooze pool," which can occasionally be found in valleys or depressions, but in this case, it seems one had formed underground.

It was dissolving soil and plant roots underground, expanding the cavity while creating a colony.

And at the bottom of that hole was a pool of Red Ooze!

<b>

The dissolving power of low-level ooze types does not pose a threat to humans. However, "Red Ooze" can inflict considerable damage to human skin.

If Helena fell into such a pool, it would burn her delicate skin!

Thinking this, I intended to carry Helena away from the spot, but I accidentally stepped through the ground!

<b>

In other words, I got carried away!

<b>

I ended up sliding into the ooze colony while holding Helena.

Yes! I landed in the ooze pool on my behind!

<b>

Immediately, the ooze's slimy texture seeped into my backside, and I felt the ooze squirming, spreading from my buttocks to my inner thighs!

Goosebumps shot up my body like an electric shock!!

<b>

"Pinyamyaaahhh!!!"

"Wh-what's wrong, Onee-shamiya?!"

<b>

With all the hair on my body standing on end, I let out a voiceless scream and jumped about 20 meters into the air while still holding Helena.

Then, without thinking, I shot magic down towards the ooze pool.

<b>

《Fire Strike》

It was not a spirit magic I learned here, but my own magic that doesn't require incantation.

Even though it was an initial magic with reduced control level, its power was incomparable to spirit magic.

The small fireball shot out, exceeding the speed of sound, piercing through the ooze colony.

The mass of ooze evaporated instantly, and the flame bullet that deeply penetrated the depression melted the soil, causing the ground to boil.

<b>

"What the hell?!"

"Su-chan? Huh?! Su-chan?!!"

"Vivi! The wall! Quickly!!"

"R-Rock Wall!!"

<b>

Witnessing the ground erupting with lava just under 10 meters away, Vivi and the others were thrown into a bit of a panic.

Dana, at the front, was blown away by the sudden hot wind, and Colin quickly instructed Vivi to create a barrier to deflect the hot wind.

<b>

By the time Mary rushed to Dana, who was rolling around in the hot wind, I had already landed back on the ground.

However, while carefully holding Helena, I couldn't endure the slimy sensation wrapping around my lower body, and I knelt down, sobbing uncontrollably.

<b>

"Eh? Su-chan?! Wait! I'll wash it off right away!!"

<b>

Mia immediately noticed me, who had just landed, and the ooze clinging to my lower body, and used "Water" to wash it all away.

Helena, whom I was holding, seemed to have blacked out from the G-force when I jumped up so suddenly.

<b>

Colin carried Helena, while Dana held me, who was still sobbing without making a sound, and everyone hurried towards the first outpost.

<b>

"Anyaa... inyaa! I-inyaaahhh! Hiiinyaaahhh!!!"

<b>

Yes! At that moment, I completely lost my ability to speak due to the overwhelming oozy sensation attacking this maiden!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Ah, this is terrible..."

<b>

Colin picked up a piece that looked like a rag and sighed.

<b>

"Uuuhh... uuhhh... wehh..."

"Don't worry, Su-chan! It's already getting clean!"

"I-I'll go get a new towel!"

"Oh! I'll go too! I'll fetch another bucket of clean water!!"

<b>

Helena and Mary hurriedly dashed out of the room, flinging the door open.

<b>

This is the first conference room of the first outpost.

I was carried in by Dana, and here, everyone was helping me remove the tattered remnants of my clothing that had been ruined by the ooze.

Helena, who had lost consciousness, had already recovered and was visibly back to her energetic self.

<b>

I had regained some composure, but the lingering sensation of that ooze was still present... More than that, this situation is just...

I leaned my hands on the conference table, trembling slightly as Colin and Mia helped me remove the remnants stuck around my backside.

Vivi was squeezing several towels while letting out a sigh that seemed to say, "Good grief."

Algernon was running around our feet, darting here and there.

Don't look up at my feet, little creature... I might step on you!

<b>

The reason we were doing this in the conference room is that...

Originally, there was a girls' changing room in this outpost, but it was destroyed the other day for some reason, and it's currently under repair and unusable.

Until the repairs are completed, this room is being used as a girls' changing room, and when in use, a sign saying "Girls' Use" is hung on the conference room doorknob to indicate it's being utilized for changing.

There are many men in the outpost, but they are all genuinely pure gentlemen, so there are no suicidal individuals who would open a door with that sign hanging.

Women of Amukam are scary!

<b>

So, what Colin, Mia, and Vivi are currently helping me with is essentially... the remnants of my underwear...

<b>

Even though the Red Ooze I fell into has strong dissolving power, it doesn't have the ability to instantly harm human skin.

Moreover, it couldn't possibly dissolve equipment made of magical beast leather.

So, while my black leather mini skirt and knee-high boots made from magical beast leather were unharmed, my thigh-high socks and underwear made of regular fabric were not so fortunate... They were utterly ruined.

So now, I am leaning on the table, sticking my bare feet out while my boots are off, having everyone help me remove the remnants of fabric!

Ahh, what a predicament?! Sob...

What? You think I should just wash it off with a strong water flow?

But the melted fibers are stuck to my skin! It would be quicker and cleaner to peel them off one by one by hand than to wash them or scrub them! That's what Colin said!! So I'm sticking my backside out for everyone to help me!! Sob sob...

I burned all the pieces of the individual that digested my underwear, completely incinerating them! I did it!!

<b>

Anna Mary, who was waiting for our return at the outpost, immediately went home to fetch a spare pair of underwear when she learned of my condition.

Seeing that there were still quite a few remnants stuck to me, Helena and Mary left the room to clean me up properly.

I realized that they were worried about me as they rushed out so hurriedly... and I finally began to calm down a little.

<b>

"Ah, ah, I'm not red, am I?"

<b>

As I started to calm down, I became increasingly concerned about that. I wondered if I looked like a monkey's backside... or something.

<b>

"You're fine, Su-chan! You're as cute as always!"

<b>

Mia said while still removing the remnants around me.

And gradually, I became more and more aware of how embarrassingly exposed I was.

There are quite a few people on the other side of the door, and what on earth am I wearing right now?!

<b>

"Is the towel... still not here? Is it still coming?"

<b>

As I reached out to lower the hem of my mini skirt, I caught a glimpse of Dana grinning at me from the corner of my eye.

But more than that, I couldn't help but feel a shiver as I sensed someone approaching us.

Huh? Huh?! Are they coming straight into this room while talking normally?

This room is located on the north side of the outpost, at the end of a straight hallway.

There's only this room at the end of that hallway!

No! But the "In Use" sign is hanging, right? They wouldn't open the door, would they? Normally, they would stop, right?!

<b>

"Let's see... Is the cute one here?"

<b>

Ignoring my panic, Dana approached with a big smile and reached between Colin and Mia, who were removing the remnants from my backside, and effortlessly pulled up my mini skirt completely!

The moment Dana's outrageous act occurred, I could hear the voices of the two of them at the same time!

<b>

"That's why! Arvin isn't aware of his surroundings...!"

"Wait a minute, bro! That was just a little bit... was it? ...Huh?"

<b>

They opened the door!

<b>

And time stopped!! 

<b>

At that moment, I think I had a face like a clay figurine screaming like Munch!

I inhaled sharply and let out a scream, "Hiiiii!!!" Was it a scream of despair?!!

Colin, who was beside me, opened his mouth in shock, facing the door, and without looking, he quickly pulled down the hem of my mini skirt.

<b>

"W-wait! I'm sorry! This is a mistake! I didn't see anything! It's all good! That white...!!!"

<b>

It was a fleeting moment.

In less than three seconds, Rider spewed out a long excuse, while Arvin stared wide-eyed, speechless.

At that moment, my brain was overheating, and I felt steam about to burst from my ears!!

<b>

With a whoosh, a corkscrew punch landed squarely on Rider's face. The well-structured features of his face twisted and sunk in as the fist spiraled inward.

Mia's left fist had perfectly struck the face of the debagame Rider in that instant!!

By that time, Vivi's right fist also pierced into the face of the debagame brother.

<b>

"Don't you dare stare at us!!!!"

<b>

Mia and Vivi's battle cries echoed around us.

Both of them, having taken punches, rolled down the long hallway and crashed through the wall at the end, flying outside.

<b>

Damn it!! I underestimated those brothers!!

This is why the Haggard family has hero attributes!!

I never thought I would become a victim of a lucky accident!

Once I realized those two were approaching, I should have been more vigilant!!

<b>

After that, I was the one who was screaming voicelessly throughout the outpost!

<b>

<b>

<b>

The sign hanging on the door had apparently fallen off when Helena and Mary rushed outside.

Helena cried and clung to me, apologizing for the ooze incident... but no, Helena isn't to blame, it's not her fault!

I gently patted Helena's head, reassuring her.

<b>

The ones at fault are the ooze and those... those debagame brothers!!!

And... Dana!!

When I glared at Dana, she turned away and began to whistle silently!

Is she from the Showa era?! Does she know Showa taste?! That's way too cliché!!

<b>

In any case, I won't speak to her! When I turned away, Dana also clung to me, crying and apologizing.

Moreover, she was squeezing and groping various parts of me!!

Ah, ah, she doesn't have any intention of apologizing, does she?! Dana! You're just satisfying your own desires, aren't you?!!

Soon after, Dana was met with a powerful smack to the back of her head from Colin. Well, that's only natural!!

<b>

<b>

And that night, Papa Howard apparently went out somewhere in his ultimate gear, but I have no idea about that!

<b>

By the way... after that summer, whenever ooze types were found in the Amukam forest, for some reason, columns of fire would erupt in those locations... which is a completely unnecessary afterstory!!

Thank you for reading!

I just wanted to write a story about a lucky accident (・`ω´・)
