# 43 - The Minutiae of Copetown

Come in, miss.

<blank>

Mariebelle put a cup of tea on the table. The aroma of Earl Grey tickled my nostrils.

<blank>

I hear you had a pretty spectacular turnout."

I didn't do anything, okay?

<blank>

That's what Marie Belle, looking amused and with a big smile on her face, leaned forward and asked me.

I answered Mariebelle with a slightly upturned stare, holding the cup close to my mouth with both hands and enjoying the aroma of the tea rising from it.

<blank>

In fact, they didn't do much of anything.

The men lurking in the alleyway came barreling in with a suspicious presence, and we just choloed and ducked.

I did it by shifting their awareness of their actions a bit when I ducked, so they just rolled off on their own, tangled up with both of us.

Well, I smashed a lot of liquor bottles and stuff, so I made a loud noise and a lot of people came.

<blank>

And the two guys are upside down, too, with their faces in each other's crotches...ugh.

I can't stay here when I think of it! Who's the good guy in this picture? You feel like that?

It was pathetic to be exposed to so many people, but one of them flew off his face and face-slid on the cobblestones, so it's a bit horrifying to imagine what happened to his face....

<blank>

<blank>

The two men the young lady seized were the remnants of a gang of robbers who had escaped from De Kembel.

<blank>

I didn't seize you, okay? I didn't touch you!

<blank>

Mr. Roland told us that as well."

'Ah, the chief of the guard came personally to secure the bandits.

<blank>

Mr. Roland is the head of the guard who organizes the guards in Copetown.

I have met him several times because he once came to the Cloud house.

So I know your face.

<blank>

I heard that you broke into Cecily's store, so, well, I guess it's only natural!"

<blank>

Maribel-san said, "The chief of guards is all over Cecily-san, you know..." and sipped her tea.

<blank>

Cecily's store, at? Where's your store? Are you all hurt?

I'm fine. I heard that Cecily ended up as a warriors as a matter of course."

<blank>

I almost sat up, but was relieved to hear that everyone was safe.

<blank>

Well, if you think about it calmly, there is no way that a robbery in the neighborhood could do anything to Mr. Cecily.

Cecily is a half-elf who owns a boutique in Copetown.

He looks around 20 years old, but he is a former top-ranked and powerful person.

Half-elves are the same as elves in that their appearance does not change after they reach adulthood, so if you underestimate them because of their young appearance, you will be in for a world of pain.

And the waitstaff are all active members of the group.

It means they were dead in the water when they went after Cecily's store.

<blank>

<blank>

Afterwards, over tea, Mariebelle told me what had happened.

<blank>

Originally, they were a gang of thugs who were active in the city of "Fabrice" in the east.

However, he lost his power in an altercation with another group and was chased out of Fabrice, so he drifted to Dekenbel, but as soon as he arrived, he caused some kind of commotion.

That was about a week ago now.

And that the remnants of that party showed up at Cecily's store today.

<blank>

There are many admirers of Cecily's among the guards, including the chief of the guard. They were all looking for the bandit with their eyes. And you...you just snatched them away so easily!

<blank>

I was just passing by!　I wanted to tsk tsk, but I swallowed it down and took a sip of tea in a refined manner.

<blank>

In general, I just came to Copetown today to deliver and pick up a package from your workshop. We are not here to exterminate bandits.

<blank>

The gift is a pile of wild vegetables from Amkamu, as requested by Sonia-mama.

I came to share a basket full of wild vegetables. All by himself!

Yes, I have 'learned to steer'! I have "learned to steer"! Hmph!

<blank>

Is it because dwarves are called "people of the earth"? They love wild vegetables.

Living in a town like this, it is difficult to pick them on a daily basis, so when I bring them to them when I have a lot, they are very happy to see me.

Well, most of it will be consumed with alcoholic beverages...

<blank>

Hey, Cloud's girl, thanks for waiting.

<blank>

While we were talking about this, Mr. Marsh appeared from the workshop in the back.

In his hands he holds two swords in sheaths.

It's my favorite silver sword.

<blank>

Next week will be your big day! I've taken good care of you!"

<blank>

Mr. Marsh said happily and handed me the sword.

I will pull it out of its sheath and take a look at it immediately.

Not a scratch, not even a cloud! The face is reflected in the blade of the sword like a mirror.

Isn't it about 20% more brilliant?

<blank>

The leather armor has been adjusted with magical steel and left at Cecily's. You can go there later and have it fine-tuned. You can go there later and have it fine-tuned for size."

Thank you for everything."

Nani! I know it's a little late to tell you to hang in there missy... but get a grip!"

<blank>

I thanked Mr. Marsh again, received the sword, and left the workshop.

We headed directly to Cecily's restaurant, "Late Afternoon.

<blank>

There were still a couple of guards in the store, but Millie, a waitress, spotted me and came out to the front of the store.

It's a welcome with beautiful turquoise eyes shining and a smile that spills over.

<blank>

Miss Susie! Welcome!

Hello, Millie. Are you all right, sir? I heard you had a rough day."

"Oh, ha-ha-ha... did you hear already? No, it was nothing serious. The manager was almost always...oh! I'm sorry! I'll get the manager right away!

<blank>

Millie-san is heading to the back of the store. Tencho! Tenchoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!　and calling for Cecily-san.

He is as energetic as ever. The guard next to you suddenly shouted at you, and you look surprised, right?

<blank>

Oh my God! You're making too much noise, Millie!"

<blank>

A graceful, beautiful woman with long, flowing hair came out from the back of the store and walked to the front of the store.

Her healthy, brown legs peek boldly out from the slit of her long, tight skirt.

She has a slender figure, but she has a lot of body, which is very stimulating.

However, it is not an inflammatory thing at all, and it wears a classy style.

She has brunette hair that reaches her waist and amber eyes.

It's a look that can't help but catch one's eye.

<blank>

A brightly colored scarf is folded over the head like a turban, tied back and hanging down.

It is hard to tell because the scarf hides the tops of his ears, but he is a half-elf.

I didn't get it at first...

If her ears were large and extended outward like the elves I know, a scarf like this would not cover them, so there would be no way to make a mistake, but Cecily's ears are much smaller.

That's what makes them so inconspicuous, as they are only about the size and tongues of the big, illogical okappa aliens of the universe.

<blank>

'Oh my! Miss Cloud! Welcome."

<blank>

Cecily-san came out to the storefront with a smile and a word of encouragement to the guards.

When he noticed me, he came very close to me.

<blank>

Hello Cecily. I hear you have been very active."

<blank>

I greet Cecily with a smile.

<blank>

'That's right! Miss! The manager literally killed the sweltering bastards one after another in an instant!"

It wasn't Millie who laid a hand on me first!"

I just reaped my consciousness promptly! But, sir, isn't that over-defense?"

What? You tried to touch our little Millie, didn't you? It's a foregone conclusion, isn't it?"

I'm sorry to hear you say that, but...well..."

And I had heard about them from Mr. Lo. I knew right away that they were the remnants of a band of thieves. I was not going to take it easy on them at all! But it was frustrating to let them go.

<blank>

Cecily smiles happily as she talks, and Millie answers with a shy look on her cheeks.

By the way, "Ro-kun" seems to refer to the head of the Roland guard.

The head of the guard is also out of shape when it comes to Cecily....

I think it's pretty great that Millie has Cecily's approval, don't you?

<blank>

I knew you were in the middle of the pack, Millie. It's a quintessence!"

Oh, no! I'm in the middle of the pack, but I've only just made it to the 4th level last year! I'm not even close! Not even close!

<blank>

Millie is turning bright red, extending her hands toward me and waving them in a disapproving manner.

Naniyada this guy is so cute!

I don't think you need to be so modest.

Millie, I think you said you're 19 now? I think it's great to be 4th at that age!

<blank>

Oh, 4th is a rank in the Protectorate, similar to "Dan" in Japanese Judo and Karate, I guess.

The first group rank that hits the first level is the 1st.

And then 2nd 3rd, and from the 4th it's called the middle rank.

<blank>

In other words, at just 19 years of age, Millie-san is a skilled judo and karate player with the rank of "Yondan" (4th dan)!

Isn't this awesome? Isn't it great? Millie, I think you should be more proud of yourself, don't you?

<blank>

I don't even have a tag yet. I don't even have a tag yet! You should be more proud of yourself, right?

"Oh, to be proud in front of a young lady! You're a disgrace!

<blank>

Millie turned bright red and began to waddle.

Cecily, who was watching, clapped her hands and shouted as if she remembered.

<blank>

Oh." Tag! Oh, no, I'm so bad! You're here for sizing, right? Miss."

Yes, sir! Mr. Marsh told me he delivered it to you."

I'm sorry, I've been so busy...it's next week, isn't it? It won't take long, so let's get it together right away!

Yes! I look forward to working with you."

It's literally a growth spurt...it's going to need some TLC."

<blank>

Cecily-san then moved her gaze up and down my body and looked intently at one point.

Ha! Growth spurt? Is that chest circumference-wise? Bust-wise? Bust-wise? I wonder if it is? I wonder if it is?

I wonder if this is the result of the daily and nightly rubbing and massaging? Is this what it means to be rewarded for your daily efforts?

Well, actually, it's what I like to do....

But, nmmm! I'll have to start rubbing and massaging them thoroughly tonight! Mmmm!

<blank>

I let Cecily guide me to the back of the store and proceeded onward, putting aside my delusions...or rather, my determination.

In the storefront, I overheard Millie talking to the guards and answering their questions.

<blank>

Yes, you are the daughter of the Cloud family. Yes, I will be celebrating my 'coming of age' ceremony next week..."

<blank>

Yes, it's my birthday next week! Next week is my birthday and the "Coming of Age Ceremony" will be held.

I am already looking forward to it!
