# Episode 43: Details of Cooptown

"Please, miss."

<b>

As she said this, Marie Bell placed the teacup on the table. The comforting aroma of Earl Grey tickled my nostrils.

<b>

"It seems you had quite a flashy encounter, didn't you?"

"I didn't do anything, you know?"

<b>

With a smile that radiated interest, Marie Bell leaned in and asked.

I brought the cup closer to my mouth with both hands, enjoying the scent of the tea rising from it, and replied to Marie Bell with a slightly upward glance.

<b>

In reality, I hadn't done anything significant.

The men lurking in the alley had come charging in, exuding a suspicious aura, and I simply dodged them.

When I dodged, I slightly shifted their awareness, causing them to entangle with each other and roll away.

Well, they did make a loud noise when they smashed a bottle of alcohol, which attracted a lot of people.

<b>

Moreover, the two men ended up tangled upside down, with their faces buried in each other's groins... Ugh.

It's unbearable to think about! What a ridiculous sight?! 

They were pitifully exposed to so many eyes, but one of them had face-planted and slid across the cobblestones, so imagining what his face looked like is a bit horror-like...

<b>

<b>

"I heard that the two you apprehended were remnants of a gang of robbers who escaped from Dekkenbel."

<b>

I didn't apprehend anyone, okay? I didn't lay a hand on them!

<b>

"I heard that from Roland as well."

"Oh, so the captain of the guards came personally to secure the bandits."

<b>

Roland is the captain who oversees the guards in Cooptown.

I've met him several times since he has visited the Cloud family.

So I know his face.

<b>

"It seems they broke into Cecily's shop, so it's only natural!"

<b>

Marie Bell said that the captain is quite infatuated with Cecily... and sipped her tea.

<b>

"Cecily's shop, you say?! Is everyone alright?! Did anyone get hurt?!"

"They're fine. Apparently, Cecily single-handedly dealt with them."

<b>

I almost stood up in shock, but I sighed in relief knowing everyone was safe.

<b>

Well, if I think about it calmly, there's no way a mere gang of robbers could do anything to Cecily.

Cecily is a half-elf who runs a boutique in Cooptown.

She looks to be in her twenties, but she is a powerful individual with a former high-ranking status.

Half-elves, like elves, do not change in appearance after reaching adulthood, so underestimating her because of her youthful looks could lead to painful consequences.

Moreover, her staff consists of active members of the guild.

The moment they targeted Cecily's shop, they were doomed.

<b>

<b>

While enjoying tea, Marie Bell told me the details of the incident.

<b>

Originally, those guys were a gang of thugs that had been running rampant in the eastern city of "Fablis."

However, they lost power due to disputes with other groups and were driven out of Fablis, flowing into Dekkenbel. But as soon as they arrived, they caused some commotion, and coincidentally, a large or small detachment of the Order of Knights was stationed in Dekkenbel, and most of their group, including their leader, was defeated.

That happened about a week ago.

And today, the remnants showed up at Cecily's shop.

<b>

"Many of the guards, including the captain, are fans of Cecily. It seems they were all searching for the bandits with bloodshot eyes. And you... you just casually swooped in and took care of it!"

<b>

I wanted to retort that I just happened to pass by, but I swallowed it down and elegantly took a sip of tea.

<b>

After all, I had only come to Cooptown today to deliver and pick up something for the workshop. I wasn't here to hunt down thieves.

<b>

The delivery was a mountain of wild vegetables harvested from Amukam, requested by Sonia Mama.

I had come to share a basket full of wild vegetables. All by myself!

Yes! I have "learned how to manage the cargo"! Hoo-hooâ™ª

<b>

I wonder if it's because the dwarves are called "the people of the earth"? They apparently love wild vegetables.

Since it's difficult to gather them while living in town, they are very pleased when I bring a lot when I can.

Well, they probably get consumed mostly as snacks for drinking...

<b>

"Cloud's girl, sorry to keep you waiting."

<b>

As I was talking, Marsh appeared from the workshop in the back.

He was holding two sheathed swords in his hands.

My beloved silver sword.

<b>

"Next week is your big day! I've taken great care of it!"

<b>

Marsh said happily as he handed me the sword.

I immediately drew it from the sheath to take a look.

Not a single scratch, not even a smudge! My face is reflected in the blade like a mirror.

Has it gained about twenty percent more shine?!

<b>

"I've finished adjusting the leather armor and left it with Cecily. You should go later to have it resized."

"Thank you for everything."

"Don't mention it! It's too late to say 'good luck' to you now... Just do your best!"

<b>

I thanked Marsh again, took the sword, and left the workshop.

I headed straight to Cecily's shop, "Afternoon."

<b>

There were still a couple of guards outside, but the shop assistant, Millie, spotted me and came out to greet me.

Her beautiful turquoise blue eyes sparkled as she welcomed me with a radiant smile.

<b>

"Lady Suzy! Welcome!!"

"Hello, Millie. Are you alright? I heard it was quite a situation."

"Oh, haha... Have you already heard? No, it wasn't a big deal at all! Mostly, the manager... Ah! Excuse me! I'll go get the manager right away!"

<b>

Millie called out to Cecily from the back of the shop, shouting, "Manager! Manager!"

As always, she's a lively person. The guard next to her looked surprised by her sudden shout.

<b>

"Enough! You're too noisy, Millie!"

<b>

From the back of the shop, a graceful beauty with long hair came out.

Her healthy, tanned legs boldly peeked from the slit of her tight long skirt.

She has a slender figure, but her curves are quite stimulating.

However, it is not at all provocative; she carries an elegant demeanor.

Her brunette hair reaches her waist, and her amber eyes are captivating.

It's impossible not to be drawn to her appearance.

<b>

She wore a colorful scarf wrapped around her head like a turban, tied at the back.

It's hard to tell because the scarf covers above her ears, but she is a half-elf.

I didn't realize it at first...

If her ears were as large and protruding as the elves I know, they wouldn't be hidden by just a scarf, but Cecily's ears are much smaller.

They're so small that they could be mistaken for the pointy ears of a non-logical alien from a space opera.

<b>

"Oh! Cloud's girl! Welcome!"

<b>

Cecily came out to the front of the shop, smiling and offering words of encouragement to the guards.

When she noticed me, she walked over.

<b>

"Hello, Cecily. I heard you were quite active."

<b>

I returned her smile with a greeting.

<b>

"That's right! Lady! The manager took down those brutish fellows one after another in a literal instant!"

"Wasn't it Millie who first laid a hand on them?"

"I just swiftly took their consciousness! But the manager's actions... were they not excessive self-defense?"

"Well, they were trying to lay a hand on our adorable Millie, right?! Isn't that a natural consequence?"

"W-well, if you put it that way, um..."

"And I had heard from Roland too. I immediately recognized them as remnants of the bandit gang. I had no intention of holding back! But I was frustrated that I let two escape."

<b>

Cecily spoke with a cheerful smile, while Millie blushed and replied shyly.

By the way, "Roland" refers to Captain Roland.

The captain is completely powerless when it comes to Cecily...

I think it's quite impressive that Millie is acknowledged by someone like Cecily.

<b>

"Indeed, Millie is already at the mid-rank. Impressive!"

"N-no! Even though I'm at mid-rank, I just barely moved up to 4th last year! I'm still far from being anything special! Still so far!!"

<b>

Millie turned bright red, extending her hands towards me and shaking her head in denial.

What is this? This person is so cute!!

I don't think she needs to be so humble.

Millie mentioned she is 19 years old, right? I think it's amazing that she has reached 4th at that age!

<b>

Oh, 4th refers to the rank in the civil guard, which is somewhat similar to the "dan" ranks in Japanese judo or karate.

The first rank, equivalent to the first dan, is called 1st.

Then it continues with 2nd and 3rd, and from 4th onwards, it is referred to as mid-rank.

<b>

In other words, Millie is a capable individual holding the rank equivalent to "4th dan" in judo or karate at the young age of 19!

Isn't that impressive? It's amazing, right?! I think Millie should be more proud of herself!

<b>

"I'm still without a tag. Millie, you're amazing! I think you should be more proud!"

"W-who am I to boast in front of you, Lady?! N-no way!!"

<b>

Millie turned bright red and started flustering.

Seeing this, Cecily clapped her hands and suddenly remembered something.

<b>

"Oh! The tag!! How could I forget! You came for the size adjustment, right, dear?"

"Yes! I heard from Marsh that it was delivered here."

"I'm so sorry for the commotion... It's already next week, isn't it? Let's get it done right away!"

"Yes! Thank you very much."

"You're in a growth period, after all... It seems some adjustments will be necessary."

<b>

Cecily said as she moved her gaze over my body from top to bottom, fixating on one point.

Huh! Growth period?! Is that about my chest? My bust?! Is that what it is?!!

Could this be the result of my daily and nightly... massage sessions?! Is this what they mean when they say hard work pays off?!

...Well, to be honest, I do enjoy doing it...

But, hmm! From tonight on, I must continue to massage thoroughly! Hmm!

<b>

While I was lost in my thoughts... no, my determination, Cecily guided me to the back of the shop.

I could hear Millie talking to the guards outside, responding to them.

<b>

"Yes, she is the daughter of the Cloud family. That's right, she will be celebrating her 'Coming of Age' next week..."

<b>

That's right! Next week is my birthday, and the "Coming of Age" ceremony will be held.

I can't wait for it!
