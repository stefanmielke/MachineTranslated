# Episode 49: Suzy Cloud's Survival Part 1

"We can only guide you this far. From here on, you have to move on your own."

<b>

Aria pointed deeper into the forest.

This is a place nearly 1 kilometer inside from the forest entrance. It's almost at the edge of the safe zone.

<b>

"Just a little further from here is still the safe zone. The thick stake we marked earlier is the boundary where you have been hunting until now. And from here on, it's basically a no-entry zone for children."

<b>

I nodded in response to Aria's explanation.

<b>

"You will camp in this area from the stake over here."

<b>

Aria pointed her finger back in the direction we came from, then turned it back to face me as she said this.

<b>

"Our team will watch over you from a distance, so do your best!"

"Good luck, Lady Suzy."

"Please be careful not to get hurt, Miss."

"You'll be just fine, Lady! We're watching over you with confidence!"

"Thank you, Irta, Keti, and Millie. I appreciate it, Aria."

<b>

After expressing my gratitude to the four who offered words of encouragement, I began to walk deeper into the forest.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"Well then, I need to find a camping spot."

<b>

After parting ways with Aria and the others, I walked for a while, looking around as I spoke to myself.

It hasn't been long since the sun rose, and my breath is still white.

<b>

Sunlight peeked through the leaves of the trees to the east, dazzling my eyes.

It seems that the theory for the first day is to start looking for a camping spot and begin establishing a base at this time.

<b>

Darna and Arvin didn't follow that rule, though!

<b>

I'm just an ordinary commoner, so I will stick to the basics. Yes, because I'm a commoner!!

It's important, so I repeated it, okay?!

<b>

For now, I should look for a place with good drainage and some wind protection.

<b>

<b>

The Amukam Forest is not flat land.

As you can see from the village, it has rolling hills and is rich in undulations.

While the paths in the well-maintained village are fine, the undulating areas are overgrown with grass and trees, and there are cliffs and rocky mountains.

For someone used to hiking on unmarked trails, it might be fine, but for an ordinary person, I think it's quite a hard journey.

<b>

Well, for the children of Amukam, this is still just an extension of their playground!

<b>

After wandering around for about an hour, I looked for a good spot.

Near a small stream flowing through a slight valley.

I also found a place where the rocky mountain was eroded and hollowed out, showing signs that someone had camped there in the past.

<b>

I also found some rock salt from the exposed rock face of a cliff.

So, rock salt can be obtained from around here.

<b>

In the Amukam Forest, rock salt is often found, but it’s not of very good quality or taste, so it’s not actively mined.

Good quality salt normally comes from the eastern New Noxport, so they don’t bother digging up the inferior stuff here.

<b>

However, it’s not so bad that it’s poisonous, so it can be used in emergencies.

So, since I’m currently in a "just in case" situation during my survival, I’ll take a piece with me.

Now that I know where to get rock salt, I can come back here to collect it if needed!

Salt will be plentiful during this survival!

<b>

Now, as for the camping spot… I’d prefer a place that hasn’t been touched by anyone else.

So, I think I’ll climb up this slope in front of me and check out the little hill.

<b>

I climbed up while avoiding the trees and protruding rocks growing on the slope.

The trees around here are thick, but they are still only as big as I can hug with both arms.

I can move pretty easily.

If I go deeper into the forest, there are huge trees with trunks as big as a house!

<b>

I feel like there was a time when I used to knock down such big trees and fly around… but now is not the time to reminisce! Let’s forget about it! Yes, let’s forget!!

<b>

<b>

When I reached the top of the slope, there was a relatively flat area.

It’s about 10 square meters, I think? Of course, it’s not perfectly flat, and the grass and trees are well overgrown.

<b>

But the bushes are also nicely thick, so if I trim them as needed, they should provide good wind protection.

It might be a good idea to cover the area around the tent with plants like Mia does!

<b>

For now, I’ll just do some grass cutting to secure a living space.

I set my backpack down next to a nearby tree, took my sword out of the holster along with its sheath, and leaned it against my backpack.

Yeah, this sword belt is great because it allows for easy handling!

<b>

Now that I’m lighter, I pulled out the bush knife attached to the side of my backpack.

By the way, I also have a throwing knife around my waist and a sheath knife strapped to my right leg.

Yes! I’m a knife girl!

<b>

The bush knife is a small one with a blade length of about 30 centimeters.

Even so, I can easily chop off small branches and bushes with a satisfying sound.

With this, I could clear this area quickly, but it would still take about 2 to 3 hours if I wanted to cut as much as I need.

<b>

So! I’ll use magic as well.

<b>

"Kelmu Eigo Spero Eude. Suzy Cloud, daughter of Cloud connected to Amukam, calls upon the great wind guide, Jilfu. Let the blade dwell in my weapon! <<Wind Edge>>"

<b>

The wind swirled rapidly along the blade of the bush knife.

When I swung the bush knife, it cut through the bushes without any resistance.

Yes, this is good!

Next, I’ll create an image of the blade extending a bit longer and swing it.

<b>

With a swoosh, the wind blade extended to about my height, neatly cutting through the grass.

<b>

Awesome! Awesome!! It feels great!!

Of course, it’s easy to cut through, but more importantly, the power is well controlled!

<b>

Just a little while ago, I would have surely gouged not just this little hill but the surrounding hills with a single swing!

But now, it’s perfectly controlled to the power I imagined!!

<b>

This must be the effect of reducing my "ki," right?!

Surely, to others, I would only appear to have the magical power of someone like Mia or Vivi!

Yay! Now I’m normal! Ordinary… Hooray! Hehe!!

<b>

What a delightful cutting experience, isn’t it?!

It’s nice to be conventional! Being an ordinary person is the best, right?!! Ahaha!

<b>

"Ah ha! Ahahahahahahaha!"

"Mufu!"

"Uhi! Uhehehehehe!"

"Ah ha, ah ha! Ahhahahahahaha!!"

<b>

Huh!?

<b>

Oh no! I got so carried away with joy that I lost myself in the moment?!

Was I acting like a dangerous person just now?!!

<b>

The bushes… have been quite cleared.

I don’t think even five minutes have passed, but I’ve probably cleared about 6 to 7 square meters…?

That was close! I might have really turned this into a bald hill if I had gone a bit further!!

For now, there are still enough bushes around that can be used for wind protection.

<b>

That was close… As I felt relieved in the center of the cleared area, I heard rustling sounds coming from around me.

Well, I knew this would happen when I came here.

Magical beasts.

It’s a small insect magical beast called "Brown Crawler."

<b>

As the name suggests, it’s a brown caterpillar magical beast.

I can’t see them yet, but I can tell that about three caterpillars the size of puppies are crawling toward me.

Their threat level is 0.2, and even a child can handle one of them alone.

<b>

The three of them approached me from three sides, surrounding me.

I quickly cut a suitable branch from a nearby tree with the bush knife, trimmed it down to make a stick about the size of a cooking chopstick.

I embedded the bush knife into the trunk of a tree and moved to the center where the three were crawling.

<b>

One by one, the three crawlers emerged from the bushes into the clearing I had opened up.

As always, they looked like round chocolate cornet pastries and seemed delicious.

Of course, I won’t eat them!!

<b>

The chocolate cornet crawlers closed in while making squeaky sounds.

When they were about three meters away from me, they paused for a moment, raised their heads, and sprayed white stuff at me!

<b>

That was the white thread that the Brown Crawlers spit out.

<b>

This thread is sticky and entangles its prey.

Once ensnared in the thread, the prey is eventually wrapped up like a large cocoon and becomes unable to move.

The crawlers then wait for the prey inside the cocoon to weaken and stop moving before devouring it.

<b>

However, I dodged the threads that the crawlers spat out from three sides.

And while the threads were flying around, I raised the stick I had just made high, waving it like a conductor leading an orchestra, and gathered the crawler's threads onto the stick.

<b>

I spun it around, almost like making cotton candy!

<b>

This feels somewhat nostalgic.

<b>

<b>

<b>

When I was a kid, there was a big supermarket nearby with a game corner on the second floor, and they had a cotton candy machine there.

<b>

I used to make cotton candy there often.

I remember it was when I was about three or four years old.

I made it every time I was taken there, I think.

I can’t even remember who I went with anymore…

<b>

<b>

<b>

I spun the stick and wrapped the threads around it.

Since I wrapped it tightly, it didn’t turn into something fluffy like cotton candy.

It’s already bigger than the fists I made with both hands.

But the crawlers still didn’t stop spitting out threads.

<b>

By the way, these guys are caterpillars in appearance, but they eventually become adults.

They become a magical beast called "Green Moth," which has a threat level of 0.6.

<b>

It’s a name that makes you want to tie it to driftwood, but their attacks are quite vicious as they sprinkle scales from above.

Oh, and just to clarify, the "threat level" I’ve been talking about.

<b>

This is a measure of the strength of magical beasts set by the civil defense corps, and a "1" means "equal to one 1st person."

So, a "threat level of 2" means two people.

A "threat level of 3" means it has the fighting power to match three 1st people.

<b>

Even if it’s said to be "equal to one 1st person," there are differences in individual strength.

There are front-line fighters and support roles, so it’s just an average guideline.

<b>

So even if it’s a "threat level of 3," there are times when three people challenge it and lose, and times when they win.

If you want to ensure victory, they say to bring one more person.

<b>

<b>

With that said, the threads I’ve gathered have already grown to the size of a basketball.

The crawlers have stopped spitting out threads.

It seems they’ve run out.

<b>

These guys produce threads by synthesizing bodily fluids inside them and spit them out.

They don’t have something like a "thread pouch" inside their bodies!

So, right now, they’ve exhausted all the bodily fluids they had aimed at me!

I feel like I’ve squeezed out every last drop from them!

<b>

Having lost their means of attack, the crawlers are now hesitating and fidgeting, unsure of what to do.

They look a bit cute.

However! I have no use for you now that you’ve exhausted your resources!

I kicked the crawlers away with a pop-pop-pop.

<b>

Since I held back to avoid defeating them, all three of them flew over the hill and disappeared into the sky.

<b>

They’ll accumulate bodily fluids again in a few days.

After all, the village buys this thread.

This is also one of the ways for the village children to earn pocket money.

Now is the time to harvest the threads from the crawlers that winter as eggs and hatch when it gets warm!

So I chased them away instead of defeating them.

I’m sure I’ll encounter them one or two more times during this trial.

Hehehe, they can come anytime to become my sustenance!

Once they’ve stored up plenty of white threads, they’ll come back to spit them out again! I’ll squeeze as much as I want from them! Hehe♪

<b>

<b>

<b>

Well then, I ended up spending extra time when I was supposed to be setting up the campsite.

I should hurry up and pitch the tent.

There’s still a lot to do!
