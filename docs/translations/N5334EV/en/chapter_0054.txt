# 49 Survival of Suzy Cloud Part 1

That's as far as we can take you. From here on, you're on your own."

<blank>

Aria pointed toward the back of the forest.

This place is almost a kilometer from the entrance to the forest. It is at the very edge of the safe zone.

<blank>

The safe zone is a little bit further from here. The thick stakes that were just driven in are the boundary line where you guys have been hunting so far. From there on, it's basically off-limits to children.

<blank>

He nodded back at Aria's explanation.

<blank>

You will camp from the stake to this area here.

<blank>

Aria said as she pointed her outstretched fingertips in the direction from which she had just come and turned them once more in a circle in front of her.

<blank>

Our team will be watching over you from a distance from now on! Be safe!"

Good luck, Miss Susie."

Be careful, young lady, don't hurt yourself."

I have no problem with your daughter! I'll watch over her with peace of mind!"

Thank you, Irta, Ketty and Millie. Best regards, Alia."

<blank>

After thanking the four men for their words of encouragement, he walked deeper into the forest.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, at least we'll have to find a place to camp.

<blank>

After leaving Aria and the others, I continued on for a while, looking around and talking to myself.

It hasn't been that long since the sun rose, and my breath is white.

<blank>

The sun's rays glint through the shadows of the leaves in the trees to the east, dazzling the eye.

It is said that the theory of the first day is to start looking for a campsite and building a base of operations at this time.

<blank>

Dana and Irvin were not limited to that, I hear!

<blank>

I am a commoner, so I will follow the rules. Yes, I am a commoner!

I repeated it because it's important, okay?

<blank>

Let's find a place with good drainage and shelter from the wind.

<blank>

<blank>

The Amkam forest is not flat land.

As you can see from the village, the land is rich in undulations.

Aside from the well-maintained village roads, the undulations are overgrown with grass and trees, and there are even cliffs and rocky mountains.

If you are accustomed to hiking in the mountains on pathless trails, however, it is a very hard route for ordinary people.

<blank>

Well, for the children of AMCAM, this level is still an extension of the playground!

<blank>

I walked around for an hour or so, looking for a place that looked good.

Or beside a small stream that flows into a small valley.

I also found some gouged and hollowed areas on the rocky hillside and other traces of where someone might have camped in the past.

<blank>

In addition, we found pieces of rock salt on the exposed rock face of the cliff.

You can get rock salt from this area too.

<blank>

Rock salt is often found in the Amkamu forest, but it is not of good quality or taste, so it is not actively dug out.

Salt is usually distributed from New Knoxport in the east, so they don't bother to dig out poor quality salt here.

<blank>

However, the quality is not so bad that it is poisonous, so it is sometimes used when the need arises.

I'm in the middle of a survival situation! I'm in the midst of a survival situation, so I'm going to take a piece of it with me.

I now know where I can get rock salt!

Salt was in plentiful supply during the survival period!

<blank>

Now, the important thing is the place to camp... I'd prefer an untouched place anyway, not after someone else.

So now I will climb up the slope that rises in front of me and see what this little mountain looks like.

<blank>

We climbed up, avoiding trees growing on the slope and rocks jutting out.

The trees around here are thick, but still only enough for me to hold in both hands.

It proceeds in quite a heap.

If you go deeper into the forest, you will find large trees with trunks the size of houses!

<blank>

There was a time when I was flying through the air, reaping such a big tree...but now is not the time to dwell on memories! Now is not the time to dwell on memories! Let's forget about it!

<blank>

<blank>

Climbing up the slope to the top of the small mountain, the land was somewhat flat.

It's about 10 square meters, maybe. Of course, it is not flat, and there is a lot of vegetation.

<blank>

But the bushes are also nice and thick, so it would be a good windbreak if this is trimmed as much as needed.

Maybe we could imitate Mia and cover the area around the tent with plants!

<blank>

At any rate, let's mow the grass appropriately to secure living space.

He lowered the backpack he was carrying to the side of a nearby tree, unsheathed his sword from the sword holster, and leaned it against his backpack.

Duh, these sword belts are good because they are so easy to handle in this kind of way!

<blank>

Once he was light, he pulled out a bush knife, a blade that was attached to the side of his backpack.

In addition, there is a throw-in knife around the waist and a sheath knife strapped to the right leg.

Duh! It's the blade girl!

<blank>

The bush knife is a small one with a blade of about 30 cm.

Still, it is quite easy to slash off twigs and bushes with a zap.

This would cut through this area right away, but it would still take a couple of hours if I wanted to mow as much as I needed to.

<blank>

So! I'll use magic as well.

<blank>

Kelm eigo spero eude." Suzy Cloud, daughter of Cloud, who is a member of Amukam, seeks and appeals to Zyrf, the leader of the great winds. Let my blade be in my grievance! â‰ªThe Wind Edge!"

<blank>

The wind spins at high speed along the blade of the bush knife.

As it is, the bush knife is swung, and the bush is mowed away without a crunch and without feeling any resistance.

Oooh, that's good!

Next, I will create an image of a sword with a slightly longer blade and swing it.

<blank>

The blade of the wind, which has grown as tall as I am, neatly cuts the grass.

<blank>

Iijan! That's good! It's so good!

Of course, the ease of use that can be reaped without difficulty is also good.

Above all, the fact that the power is kept to a minimum is a good thing!

<blank>

Just a few years ago, I'm sure I would have gouged not only this knoll but also the surrounding hills with a single swing!

But it's held back by the power of the image!

<blank>

This is still the effect of reducing "Ki", right?

I am sure that people would only perceive me as having the same amount of magic power as Mia and Bibi and the others!

We did it! Now you're as good as humanly possible! Ordinary pa...banzai! Whoo-hoo!

<blank>

It's a nice mowing, isn't it?

It's good, isn't it? It's great to be an ordinary person, isn't it? Hahaha!

<blank>

'Aha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

Mwah!"

Uhhi." Uh-hihihihihihihihihihihi!"

'Ah-ha-ha-ha! A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

<blank>

Ha!

<blank>

Oh, no! Did I get too carried away with my joy?

Did I just become a dangerous person? Me?

<blank>

The bushes...they're pretty much mowed down!

I don't think it's been more than 5 minutes and I've mowed 6-7 square meters...?

Was it bad? I almost turned it into a bald mountain!

At any rate, there are still enough bushes around to provide shelter from the wind.

<blank>

It was so close... I was relieved to be in the center of the clearing when I heard rustling and something crawling around me.

Well, I knew that when I came here.

Hexenbiest.

It's a "Brown Crawler," a small, mushy magical beast.

<blank>

It is, as its name suggests, a brown caterpillar hexenbiest.

I cannot see them yet, but I can see three caterpillars the size of puppies crawling toward me.

Its threat value is 0.2. Even a child, one on one, is enough of an opponent to put one away.

<blank>

Three of them approach me from three sides, as if surrounding me.

With my bush knife, which had stopped working its magic, I quickly cut off a suitable branch from a tree close at hand and cut off the smallest branches and leaves to create a wooden stick the size of a pair of vegetable chopsticks.

The bush knife bites into the trunk of the tree in place, removes his hand, and moves to the center where the three animals are crawling with the stick in their hands.

<blank>

One after another, three of them emerged from the bushes into the open space I had carved out.

They still look delicious, like round chocolate coronets.

Of course I won't eat it though!

<blank>

Squeaking and squeaking, the chocolate coronet comes in time.

The crawlers stopped when they were about 3 meters away from me, raised their heads, and sprayed me with white stuff!

<blank>

It is the white thread that brown crawlers spit out.

<blank>

Its threads are sticky and entangle prey.

The prey, entangled in the threads, is soon frozen like a large cocoon, unable to move even a muscle.

They are said to wait until the contents of the cocoon become too weak to move, and then devour them.

<blank>

But I was able to avoid the strings that the crawlers were spitting out from three directions.

And amidst the wildly flying Crowler's threads, I raised the chopsticks I had just made high, waved them like a conductor in a symphony orchestra, and then gathered the Crowler's threads into the chopsticks.

<blank>

Twirl, twirl, twirl, just like making cotton candy!

<blank>

I miss something about this.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

There used to be a game corner on the second floor of a large supermarket in my neighborhood when I was a kid, and they had a cotton candy machine there.

<blank>

I used to make cotton candy with it.

It was when "I" was still a kid of three or four.

Every time they took me there, I made it, he said.

I can't even remember who I was going with anymore...

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The rod is spun around and the threads are entangled.

The rolls are tightly wound, so they do not become fluffy like cotton candy.

It is already bigger than a fist made with both hands.

But the crawlers still haven't stopped spitting out their threads.

<blank>

In case you are wondering, these guys are larvae, as they appear, and eventually become adults.

It is a moth magical beast called "Green Moth" and its threat value goes up to 0.6.

<blank>

The name makes me want to tie it to a piece of driftwood, but its attacks are quite vicious, and it will spray scales at you from the sky.

Oh, it's not a powder that makes you sleepy, okay? But it is a paralyzing poison.

This is a muscle relaxant, and if inhaled properly, it is a dangerous one that can cause respiratory failure and death.

It is said to be a very troublesome opponent when attacked from upwind.

<blank>

Oh, and that "threat value" you've been talking about.

<blank>

This is the standard for the strength of demonic beasts established by the Protectorate, and it is said that "1" means "equal to the 1st one".

So, if you have a 'threat value of 2', you have two.

He said that a "threat value of 3" is a competitive strength with 3 1st people.

<blank>

There is a difference in individual strength when we say 'equal to the 1st one'.

Some people are in the vanguard and some are in support positions, so they say that is just an average guideline.

<blank>

So even with a "threat value of 3", three people can take on a challenge and lose or possibly win.

He said that if you want to be sure of winning, you have to take another person with you.

<blank>

<blank>

The threads that were wound in such a way have already grown to the size of a basketball.

Crowlers have also stopped spitting threads.

It appears that we've come to the end of the line.

<blank>

They synthesize body fluids inside their bodies to make threads, which they then spit out.

It's not like there's a 'bag of yarn' or anything in the body!

So, now they have drained all their bodily fluids to me, right?

I guess I squeezed every last drop out of them, too!

<blank>

The crawlers, who have lost their means of attack, are also maddeningly bewildered and bewildered about what to do.

A little bit cute.

But, you know what? I have no use for you now that you've already given us everything you've got!

I kicked the crawlers away with a pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop.

<blank>

I took it easy so as not to defeat them, so all three of them flew over the small mountain and disappeared into the light of the sky.

<blank>

They, too, will accumulate fluids again in a few days.

After all, the village will buy this yarn as well.

After all, this is also a way for village children to earn pocket money.

Now is the best time to make money, as they overwinter in eggs and can squeeze out the threads from the crawlers that hatch when the weather warms up!

So we got rid of them without defeating them.

I am sure we will see him one or two more times during this ordeal.

You can come anytime to be my food!

When you have accumulated a lot of white stuff, come back and spit it out again! I'll squeeze it out of you as much as I can! Hmph...

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Well, we were supposed to set up camp, but we ended up spending a lot of extra time.

Let's get the tent up quickly.

There is still much to do!



<blank>
