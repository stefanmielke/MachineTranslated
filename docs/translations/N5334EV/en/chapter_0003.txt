'Mmmmmmmmmm!　What am I going to do!"

<blank>

He raised his eyebrows, bent his mouth into a grimace, and muttered in annoyance.

<blank>

Now it sits on a large rock by the water's edge.

<blank>

Gut wide open on the rock, left hand on the base of the left thigh, elbow taut.

He had his right elbow on his right knee and his chin on his palm.

It smells like an old man for an appearance that a daughter of her age would make.

Well, the guy inside is a 32 year old man.

<blank>

"I'd say try a skill combo, but it wouldn't last because they'd all blow up first. ......

<blank>

As I was testing my skills, I found out something.

They can use not only the skills of their current enchanter job, but also their sub jobs, and even the skills of another character created on the same account.

<blank>

This is too cheat!"

<blank>

In other words, it is self-reinforcing and has the hardness and durability of a tanker, but also the attack power of an attacker, a magical turret, and can recover on its own.

<blank>

Ma-sa-ni!　Dream specifications!　Well, it's just a dream! ！！！！"

<blank>

In case you are wondering, the forest is in a terrible state in a wide area as a result of getting carried away and trying out a lot of skills.

<blank>

Trees were reaped and shattered, and the ground was paved with holes, hollows, rises, burns, and melts. The ground was paved with holes, dips, rises, burns, and melts.

It is a very destructive act of nature.

<blank>

Radar also proved to be able to determine a radius of approximately 10 kilometers.

As of now, there is no Mob response in the 5 km square. It is completely dead. It is a death zone.

<blank>

In contrast to the hellish state of the back of the house, what spreads out before one's eyes is a very quiet and relaxing space.

<blank>

Only there, in the dense forest, the sound of water echoed as if from another world.

<blank>

A waterfall falls in a place that seems to be cut off from its surroundings.

The waterfall has a drop of about 10 meters and a width of about 20 meters. Because the water falls from a rock that juts out several meters, there is a space behind the waterfall.

<blank>

The falling water is like a silk curtain.

The space behind the waterfall is large enough for people to pass through.

<blank>

The waterfall itself seems to emit a pale light due to the diffused reflection of sunlight shining through the leaves of the broadleaf trees above the waterfall, hitting the waterfall from both the surface and the back of the waterfall.

<blank>

The waterfall basin, where the curtain of water fell, was bubbling and splashing white.

<blank>

Perhaps because the water volume is not as great as it is on the left, the depth is just above a person's knees.

Still, the water was emerald green and shimmering, as if lighting had been applied to the bottom of the water.

<blank>

The waterbody spread out in 20 meter squares, and the river slowly flowed downstream, narrowing in width as it did so.

The sound of the waterfall, the murmur of the river, the rustle of leaves in the wind, and the occasional bird call.

It is a healing space of negative ion heaven.

<blank>

Suzy looks at the cool, sparkling, twinkling and shimmering surface of the water. ......

<blank>

I know that "Passive Skills" works too. ...... for all jobs! I can't see the status screen, but I wonder what it's like. It's a bit scary, even if it's just a dream. ......

<blank>

A bead of sweat drips down.

<blank>

I wish I could do something about being splattered by a single blow, maybe some spare equipment would help ......? Oh, I could use an inventory. ......

<blank>

As I became more aware, the possessions in my inventory began to emerge as an image.

<blank>

Wow, is that a lot?　That's a lot!　This is also for all the characters. ......, I wonder if I had any spare equipment. ...... Huh? Warehouse? Can we use the warehouse too?　Well, I don't think there are any warehouse NPCs around, but ...... is that okay?　Oh, and guild warehouses?　Oh, I see, Suzy is a Guilmouth. But still, I can't get enough of this dream cheat!

<blank>

It turns out that there is even a privately run guild for warehousing to increase storage in the warehouse.

<blank>

"If we can use the guild warehouse, we can pull out the equipment for training. ......"

<blank>

I'm like, "Hm?　I have to move it to my inventory to equip it. ......　Swimsuit!

<blank>

With a happy little cry, he got up from the rock, jumped down to the water's edge, and looked down at his reflection in the water mirror.

Armed in full armor, she was instantly dressed in a white one-piece bathing suit, as if the screen had been switched to a crisp.

The cleavage is emphasized, the back is exposed, and the angle of the V-zone is moderately sharp.

<blank>

I knew it!　I knew it was possible to change clothes in an instant!　It's a quintessential convenient dream specification!　......But then again, this is a very nice ......"

<blank>

She put her hands on her hips, twisted her body from side to side, and let out a sigh of excitement at the sight of her reflection in the water mirror.

<blank>

"Mmm-hmm!　Now, how about this one?"

<blank>

Then the one-piece bathing suit changed, still instantly, to a white micro bikini.

<blank>

'Oh!　That's pretty heinous too!"

<blank>

And then I would happily try various gravure-like poses, such as crossing my arms under my chest and putting my hands behind my head.

<blank>

I think this is the best thing about using female characters!　I can dress them up in whatever outfits I want and make them look the way I want them to!　Thanks for the dream!

<blank>

He seems to be very satisfied.

<blank>

'Aaah!　Could it be!"

<blank>

He looked up as if he had noticed something.

<blank>

"Does this mean that ...... is going to work by any chance?

<blank>

Suddenly, her swimsuit disappeared and she was in her underwear, just her bra and panties.

<blank>

"After all, if you take off all the equipment, you'll be in your underwear. ......, the question is, ......, where do you start?"

<blank>

I gulped and swallowed my spit.

<blank>

She wears a sports-type bra that looks like a tank top.

She rolled up her bra in one motion to remove her shirt, revealing a pair of shapely white twin dunes.

Place the removed bra on the grass nearby.

<blank>

I've taken it off!　I took it off!　I got it off!

<blank>

It's all-out jubilation.

<blank>

No - it's like a dream - I'm glad it was a dream - thanks for the dream!"

<blank>

With a voice full of emotion, he wrapped his two palms around the two bulges that could do anything.

This is what is known as a "hand bra.

<blank>

'Mmmm, there's at least ......B, right?　......C minus, or something?　...... No!　C!　Let's make it a C!　Estimated C cup!

<blank>

I mumbled to myself as if I were trying to convince myself, as I moved my hands around two or three times.

<blank>

I'm so glad I didn't choose a character that was so "nasty." I'm really glad I didn't! I'm really glad!"

<blank>

Something seems to be on the verge of overflowing.

<blank>

"...... one, ...... the next, ...... finally the last bastion ......"

<blank>

He put his fingers on his shorts and took a deep breath in! Then, as if determined, he took off the last fortress with a mighty slurp!　And then, as if determined, he took off the last fortress with a mighty "slurp!

<blank>

After taking off her clothes, she takes a serious look at the sole in her hand, inside out and out.

But then he came to himself and wondered what he was doing.　I put it down on the grass and walked to the water's edge again, my cheeks slightly stained.

<blank>

When I was ankle-deep in the water, I looked down at my feet and checked my reflection in the water mirror.

<blank>

I'd say she's around 20 years old.　I feel like a college girl. ......?"

<blank>

I muttered to myself as I looked again at my body, which was now unobstructed by anything.

<blank>

Twisting left and right to explore the lines of the body, he reflected his own body on the surface of the water and confirmed that it was his own body.

<blank>

In time, the consciousness naturally turns downward.

He gulped and spit, and his cheeks seemed to be slightly upturned.

<blank>

"...... Well, this is an area a man can't help but explore ....... We can't just pass by and pretend we didn't see it!"

<blank>

The hand that had tended to hesitate moves as if determined to do so, and .......

<blank>

......　Nm!　Nmhpahhhhhhhhh?

<blank>

The murmuring of the clear stream and the gentle calls of wild birds echoed through the area.

<blank>

Suzy was lying weakly on the grass by the water's edge, breathing very heavily, as if she had just run as fast as she could.

His cheeks are flushed and his whole body is terribly sweaty.

<blank>

I'm going to go to "............ Yabbeh!　This is yabba, isn't it?　...... woman yabba ......"

<blank>

His breathing is disorganized and he tries to turn his body sideways to get up, but his arms are not strong enough.

I gave up and decided to lie on my back and wait for my breathing to regulate.

<blank>

He placed his right hand over his heart as if to check for a heartbeat, then got up on his right knee and looked up at the sky.

<blank>

"...... women are awesome. ......"

<blank>

He muttered something that sounded like he was deeply moved. I can't tell you what's so great about it.

Eventually, his breathing calmed down and his chest, which had been moving up and down, became slower and calmer.

<blank>

"....................."

<blank>

As I come to calm down, my attention is diverted again to something else.

When I turned toward it, it started moseying around again and then went to .............

The sun was already over the top and the afternoon sun was shining.

"..............."

"......, oh no, ......, let's not go too far... it'll be endless. ......, oh no, ...... ......, let's ...... moderate ...... it ............"

<blank>

They say they do it in moderation.

It seems to have settled down somewhat after various modifications;
