# Episode 03: Susie begins her investigation

There is some (?!) erotic content. Please be careful if you are not comfortable with this.

<blank>

“Hmmmm... what should I do?!”

<blank>

She furrowed her brows, pursed her lips into a pout, and muttered to herself in a troubled voice.

<blank>

I'm sitting on a large rock by the water's edge.

<blank>

I'm sitting with my legs spread wide apart on the rock, and my left hand is resting on the base of my left thigh with my elbow straight.

My right elbow is resting on my right knee, and my chin is resting on my palm.

It's a pose that a girl of my age would do, but it looks like an old man.

Well, the person inside is a 32-year-old man.

<blank>

“Even if I say I'm going to try out skill combos, I can't keep doing it because they all blow up at the start...”

<blank>

While I was trying out skills, I realized something.

Not only can I use the skills of my current Enchanter job, but I can also use the skills of my sub-jobs and even the skills of other characters I've made with the same account.

<blank>

“This is too much of a cheat!”

<blank>

In other words, it means that you can strengthen yourself, and while retaining the toughness and durability of a tanker, you can also become an attacker with attack power and a magic turret, and you can also recover on your own.

<blank>

“It's exactly what I've been dreaming of! Well, it's just a dream, though!”

<blank>

Incidentally, as a result of repeatedly testing out the skills while getting carried away, the forest has been badly damaged over a wide area.

<blank>

The trees have been knocked down and smashed, and there are large holes all over the ground, with some areas sinking in, others rising up, and others burning or melting.

It's a terrible act of destruction to nature.

<blank>

It was also discovered that the radar could detect an area with a radius of about 10 kilometers.

At the moment, there is no Mob activity within a 5-kilometer radius. It is completely dead. It is a death zone.

<blank>

In contrast to the hellish state of affairs in the rear, what spreads out before us is a very peaceful and healing space.

<blank>

Amidst the dense forest, the sound of water echoed as if it were a different world.

<blank>

In a place that seems to have been cut off from the surrounding area, a waterfall is falling.

The drop is about 10 meters, and the width of the waterfall is about 20 meters, but because the water is falling from a rock that sticks out a few meters, there is a space behind the waterfall.

<blank>

The water falling looks like a silk curtain.

The space behind the waterfall is large enough for a person to walk through.

<blank>

The sunlight shining through the leaves of the broad-leaved trees above the waterfall, and the diffuse reflection of the light hitting the surface and back of the waterfall, makes it look as if the water itself is emitting a pale light.

<blank>

The basin at the bottom of the waterfall, where the curtain of water falls, was white with bubbles and spray.

<blank>

Perhaps because the volume of water was not that great, the depth was only up to the knees.

Even so, the water sparkled with an emerald green sheen, as if it had been lit from below.

<blank>

The water spread out over an area of 20 meters square, and then slowly flowed downstream as the river narrowed.

The sound of the waterfall, the babbling of the river, the rustling of the leaves swaying in the wind, and the occasional call of a wild bird.

It was a healing space of negative ions.

<blank>

Suzy watches the sparkling, shimmering, rippling surface of the water...

<blank>

“I know that my ‘passive skills’ are working... for all my jobs! I can't see the status screen, but I wonder what's going on? Even though it's just a dream, it's a little scary...”

<blank>

A single bead of sweat drips down.

<blank>

“I'd like to do something about the fact that I get scattered to pieces with a single hit... If I had some spare equipment... Oh, I can use the inventory...”

<blank>

When I became aware of it, the items in my inventory appeared as images.

<blank>

“Whoa, is that a lot? ! Is that for all the characters...? I wonder if there's any spare equipment... Wait, a warehouse? Can I use the warehouse too? Well, I don't think there's a warehouse NPC around... Is that okay? Oh, there's also a guild warehouse? I see, Susie was the guildmaster. Even so, this is a dream cheat!

<blank>

I found out that there is even a personal guild warehouse for increasing the storage capacity of the warehouse.

<blank>

“If I can use the guild warehouse, I can pull out the equipment for training...”

<blank>

"Hmm? I have to move it to my inventory first to use it...! I want to wear a swimsuit!”

<blank>

She shouted happily, then stood up from the rock and jumped into the water, looking down at her reflection in the water's surface.

In an instant, she was wearing a white one-piece swimsuit, as if her appearance in full armor had switched over to the screen with a click.

The cleavage was emphasized, her back was exposed, and the angle of the V-zone was quite revealing.

<blank>

“Wow, she can change her clothes in an instant after all! As expected of the convenient dream specification! ...But still, this is quite something...”

<blank>

She put her hands on her hips and, twisting her body from side to side, she let out a sigh of admiration as she gazed at her reflection in the water mirror.

<blank>

“Hmm, let's see how this one works...”

<blank>

And just like that, the one-piece swimsuit changed into a white micro bikini.

<blank>

"Wow, this one's pretty badass too!

<blank>

She looks happy, and tries out various poses like crossing her arms under her breasts or putting her hands behind her head, like a gravure model.

<blank>

“This is what it's like to use a female character! I can dress her up in whatever I like and make her look however I like! Thank you for this dream!“

<blank>

She looks very satisfied.

<blank>

”Ahhh! Could it be?"

<blank>

She looks up as if she has suddenly realized something.

<blank>

“Could this mean... that I can do it?!“

<blank>

Suddenly, her swimsuit disappeared and she was left in just her bra and panties.

<blank>

”As I thought, taking off all my equipment leaves me in my underwear... the problem is... starting from here."

<blank>

She swallowed hard.

<blank>

The bra she was wearing was a sports-type bra that looked like a tank top.

She quickly rolled up the bra as if she was taking off a shirt, and her well-shaped white breasts popped out.

She placed the bra she had removed on the grass nearby.

<blank>

"Yay! I've taken it off! I've taken it off!

<blank>

It's a cry of joy with all her might.

<blank>

“No way, it's like a dream, I'm so glad it's a dream, thank you for the dream!”

<blank>

While letting out a voice full of emotion, she wrapped her two palms around the two bulges that could do anything.

It's called a “hand bra”.

<blank>

“Hmm... I think they're about B-cup, right? Or maybe C-minus? No, they're definitely C-cup! Let's say C-cup! Estimated C-cup!“

<blank>

She muttered to herself, moving her hands back and forth, as if trying to convince herself.

<blank>

”I'm so glad I didn't choose the H-cup character. I'm so glad!”

<blank>

It seems like something is about to overflow.

<blank>

“Next time... finally the last bastion...”

<blank>

While saying this, he put his fingers on his shorts, took a deep breath, and then, with his eyes wide open, he made up his mind and quickly pulled down his last bastion.

<blank>

After taking it off, he stared at it in his hands, examining the underside.

But then he snapped out of it and asked himself, “What am I doing?”, blushing slightly as he put it down on the grass and walked to the water's edge.

<blank>

I dipped my feet into the water up to my ankles, and looked down at my feet to check my reflection in the water.

<blank>

“I guess I'm around twenty years old? I look like a college girl, don't I?”

<blank>

I muttered to myself as I looked at my body again, which was now unobstructed.

<blank>

As if exploring the lines of her body, she twisted her body from side to side, reflecting her body in the water and confirming that it was her own body.

<blank>

Before long, her consciousness naturally turned downward.

She gulped involuntarily and her cheeks seemed to be flushed a little.

<blank>

“Well, this is a place that no man can pass without exploring... I can't just pretend I didn't see it and walk on!“

<blank>

His hesitant hand starts to move as if he has made up his mind, and...

<blank>

”Hmm? Nn! Nmuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh

<blank>

The sound of a gentle bird and the babbling of a clear stream can be heard in the distance.

<blank>

Suzy lies helplessly on the grass by the water's edge, breathing very heavily as if she had just run as fast as she could.

Her cheeks were flushed and her whole body was covered in sweat.

<blank>

“Oh no! This is bad, isn't it? This woman is bad...”

<blank>

Her breathing was still erratic, and she tried to turn over onto her side and get up, but she couldn't muster the strength in her arms.

She gave up and rolled over onto her back and waited for her breathing to return to normal.

<blank>

I placed my right hand on my heart to check my pulse, and then raised my right knee and looked up at the sky.

<blank>

“Women are amazing...”

<blank>

I muttered to myself, as if I was trying to express my deep and heartfelt feelings. I can't say exactly what was so amazing.

Eventually, her breathing calmed down and the movement of her chest, which had been rising and falling, slowly became gentle.

<blank>

“…………………”

<blank>

As she calmed down, her consciousness began to drift towards that place again.

As she turned towards that place, she began to squirm again, and then...

<blank>

The sun has already passed the peak and is now shining in the afternoon.

"……………”

“It's bad... we have to stop... it'll go on forever... it's bad... let's stop...

<blank>

It seems like they're going to stop.



<blank>

I've made various corrections, and I think it's calmed down a little ^^;
