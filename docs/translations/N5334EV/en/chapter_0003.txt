# Episode 03: Starting the Suzy Verification

There are some slightly (?) erotic descriptions. Please be cautious if you are not comfortable with that.

"Umm, umm, umm! What should I do!?"

<b>

Furrowing her brow, she muttered with a frown, deep in thought.

<b>

Right now, she is sitting on a large rock by the water.

<b>

Sitting with her legs spread wide on the rock, her left hand rests on her left thigh, elbow bent.

Her right elbow is resting on her right knee, with her chin resting on her palm.

For a girl of her age, her posture is quite manly.

Well, the person inside is a 32-year-old man.

<b>

"Even if I say I want to try a skill combo, it all just blows up at the start, so it doesn't last..."

<b>

While testing her skills, she realized something.

Not only can she use the skills of her current Enchanter class, but she can also use the skills from her sub-classes and even from other characters created on the same account.

<b>

"This is way too much of a cheat!"

<b>

In other words, she can self-buff while maintaining the toughness and durability of a tank, have the attack power of an attacker, act as a magical artillery, and even recover health by herself.

<b>

"Exactly! A dream specification!! Well, it is a dream after all!!!!"

<b>

By the way, as a result of getting carried away with testing her skills, the forest has turned into a terrible state over a wide area.

<b>

Trees have been knocked down and shattered, the ground has large holes, and it is sunken, raised, burned, and melted in various places, making it look like a battlefield.

It is a significant act of environmental destruction.

<b>

She also found out that the radar can grasp a range of about 10 kilometers in radius.

Currently, there are no Mob responses within a 5-kilometer square area. It is completely barren. A death zone.

<b>

In stark contrast to the hellish scene behind her, what spreads out before her is a very tranquil healing space.

<b>

In the dense forest, the sound of water echoed as if it were a different world.

<b>

In that place, which seemed cut off from the surroundings, a waterfall was cascading down.

The drop is about 10 meters, and the width of the waterfall is about 20 meters. Water is falling from a rock that juts out a few meters, creating a space behind the waterfall.

<b>

The falling water looks like a silk curtain.

The space behind the waterfall is spacious enough for a person to pass through.

<b>

Sunlight filtering through the leaves of the broadleaf trees above the waterfall creates a dazzling reflection on the surface and behind the waterfall, making the water itself appear to emit a soft light.

<b>

The pool where the water falls is white and foamy, splashing everywhere.

<b>

Perhaps because the water volume is not that great, the depth is about knee-high for a person.

Even so, the water sparkles in emerald green, as if the bottom is illuminated, shimmering brightly.

<b>

The water area spreads over a 20-meter square, gradually narrowing as it flows downstream.

The sound of the waterfall, the babbling of the river, the rustling of leaves swaying in the wind, and the occasional calls of wild birds.

It is a healing space filled with negative ions.

<b>

Suzy, while looking at the refreshing, sparkling, and swaying surface of the water...

<b>

"I can tell that the 'Passive Skills' are working... for all classes! I can't see the status screen, but I wonder what it's like? Even though it's a dream, it's a bit scary..."

<b>

A single bead of sweat drips down.

<b>

"I want to do something about getting blown away in one hit; if I had some spare equipment... Oh, I can use the inventory..."

<b>

As she focused, the items in her inventory appeared in her mind's eye.

<b>

"Whoa! So many?!! Is this for all characters... Did I have spare equipment...? Huh? A warehouse? I can use the warehouse too?! Well, I don't think there's a warehouse NPC around here... Is that okay? Oh, there's a guild warehouse too? Right, Suzy is the guild master. Still, this dream cheat is insane!"

<b>

She realized that there was even storage for a personal-operated guild to increase the storage of the warehouse.

<b>

"If I can use the guild warehouse, I can pull out equipment for leveling up..."

<b>

"Hmm? I have to move it to the inventory before I can equip it... Whoa!! I can wear a swimsuit!!"

<b>

She exclaimed joyfully in a small voice, then stood up from the rock, jumped into the water, and looked down at her reflection in the water mirror.

Her fully armored appearance changed in an instant to a white one-piece swimsuit.

Her cleavage was emphasized, her back was largely exposed, and the angle of the V-zone was quite daring.

<b>

"Whoa! I can really change outfits in an instant! Truly a convenient dream specification! ...But still, this is quite..."

<b>

Placing her hands on her hips, she twisted her body left and right while letting out a sigh of admiration at her reflection in the water mirror.

<b>

"Hmm, hmm! Now, how about this one?"

<b>

Then, the one-piece swimsuit instantly transformed into a white micro bikini.

<b>

"Oh wow! This one is also quite deadly!"

<b>

She happily posed various ways, crossing her arms under her chest and putting her hands behind her head in a gravure-like manner.

<b>

"This is the benefit of using a female character! I can dress her in outfits I like and make her pose however I want! Thank you for this dream!!"

<b>

She seemed very satisfied.

<b>

"Ahh! Could it be!?"

<b>

She suddenly looked up as if realizing something.

<b>

"Could this mean... I can go further?!!"

<b>

Suddenly, the swimsuit vanished, leaving her in just a bra and panties.

<b>

"So if I remove all the equipment, I end up in my underwear... The question is... from here on out."

<b>

She gulped.

<b>

What she was wearing was a sports-type bra, like a tank top.

As she pulled the bra up like taking off a shirt, her nicely shaped white breasts were revealed.

She placed the removed bra on the nearby grass.

<b>

"Yes!! I did it! I took it off!!!"

<b>

It was a voice of pure joy.

<b>

"Wow, it feels like a dream—I'm glad it's a dream—thank you, dream!!"

<b>

Overwhelmed with emotion, she cupped her hands around her two ample curves.

This is what is commonly referred to as "hand bra."

<b>

"Hmm... I think I have about a B cup, right? ...C minus, maybe? ...No! It's a C! Let's say it's a C cup!!"

<b>

While moving her hands a couple of times, she murmured to herself as if convincing herself.

<b>

"I'm really glad I didn't choose a flat character. I'm really glad!"

<b>

It seems something is about to overflow.

<b>

"…N-next is... finally the last fortress..."

<b>

Saying this, she placed her fingers on her panties, took a deep breath, and with determination, she swiftly pulled down that last fortress.

<b>

After removing it, she stared intently at it, flipping it over in her hands.

But soon, she snapped back to reality, slightly blushing, thinking, "What am I doing?" and placed it on the grass before moving her feet toward the water's edge.

<b>

When she stepped into the water up to her ankles, she looked down at her feet and checked her reflection in the water mirror.

<b>

"Maybe around twenty years old? Feels like a college girl... maybe?"

<b>

She murmured while gazing at her body, now unobstructed.

<b>

As if exploring the lines of her body, she twisted left and right, reflecting herself on the water's surface, confirming that it was indeed her own body.

<b>

Gradually, her awareness naturally shifted downward.

She gulped involuntarily, and her cheeks seemed to be slightly flushed.

<b>

"…Hmm, this is a realm that a man cannot help but explore... I can't just pass by pretending I didn't see it!"

<b>

Her hesitant hands moved as if making a decision, and then...

<b>

"…Huh, hmm? Huh! Huhmuhpahhーーーーーー?!"

<b>

<b>

The sound of the clear stream and the gentle calls of wild birds echoed.

<b>

Suzy lay weakly on the grass by the water, breathing heavily as if she had just sprinted with all her might.

Her cheeks were flushed, and her whole body was drenched in sweat.

<b>

"…Yikes! This is bad, right? ...Women are intense..."

<b>

Still breathing heavily, she tried to turn her body sideways to get up, but her arms lacked strength.

Giving up, she decided to lie on her back and wait for her breathing to stabilize.

<b>

Placing her right hand over her heart to check her pulse, she bent her right knee and looked up at the sky.

<b>

"…Women are amazing..."

<b>

She murmured as if wanting to express some deep feelings. She couldn't specify what was amazing.

Eventually, her breathing calmed down, and the movement of her chest, which had been rising and falling, began to slow and become gentle.

<b>

"…………………"

<b>

As she settled down, her awareness began to drift back in that direction.

As she focused there, she began to move restlessly again, and then...

The sun had already passed its peak and was beginning to shine in the afternoon.

<b>

"……………"

"…This is bad... I need to be moderate... or it might become endless... This is bad... I need to be moderate..."

<b>

It seems she intends to do it moderately.

I think I've made various corrections and calmed down a bit＾＾；；
