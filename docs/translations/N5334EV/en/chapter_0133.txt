# 121 Episode Ruly Deet's Miscalculation

Why is this happening?

Lurie Deet was unable to catch up with his understanding of the current situation.

<blank>

<blank>

Why?

This guy should not have been able to use magic.

<blank>

In fact, I have seen this guy fail at magic several times with my own eyes.

They were the talk of the town, saying that they had the most magic power among the new students, but it is meaningless if they can't use the magic that is important to them.

<blank>

It's just a big wooden thing.

<blank>

<blank>

I thought every time I saw him sitting there with his magic outbursts day after day that it was a good feeling.

I, who can use magic well, should definitely be in a better position than this guy.

<blank>

How did it come to this?

<blank>

<blank>

Why does this guy have magic?

Moreover, he showed them how to use the magic barrier without holding a wand and without chanting.

On the contrary, it is so powerful that it cleanly drowns out the magic they unleash.

<blank>

I was told that the barrier I use is good if it halves the power of magic, but how can this be?

Furthermore, this guy is still not chanting and is even using wood magic, which is a composite attribute!

<blank>

What the hell is going on?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Lurie Deet was screaming inaudibly as her whole body was constricted by thorns.

In front of Lurie's eyes, Mia Mathieson stands with a quiet smile on her face as she steps forward.

<blank>

This guy is something different.

This guy is in a different place than what I know to be the norm.

<blank>

Lurie couldn't help but feel a chill at the sight of Mia, a presence she couldn't even begin to understand.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Just after noon that day.

Ruly Deet, with two of his cronies in tow, came to the magic department classroom to take an elective class.

<blank>

At the time of the entrance exam, Ruly, who had scored '35' in the fire attribute, thought it was a natural choice for him to choose the magic department.

The magic power of "35" is something to be proud of, considering that the average magic power of the average examinee is 20.

I'm talking about "within the general range.

<blank>

<blank>

And now, in front of that classroom, Lurie Diet felt a dusky black emotion welling up inside her.

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Karen!!!!

............ lurie."

<blank>

With all the strength he could muster, he glared at Karen Merlin, who was standing right in front of him.

<blank>

How dare you show your face in front of me like that!

Oh no! Lurie I am ......"

'Shut up and shut up! This is all your fault!

<blank>

Every bad thing that has happened since I arrived at the academy is because of Karen Merlin, who is now in front of me.

Ruly Deet is convinced of this from the bottom of his stomach.

This guy has to pay the price for that.

<blank>

It's like you've completely forgotten your place in the world!

"...... Oh, no."

I'll tell you what," he said, "you need to be educated from the very beginning! Right?

<blank>

In their grade level classes, they were in different classrooms, so they were unable to make contact with each other. Fortunately, in this elective class, they seem to have chosen the same class.

I'm going to teach its guts the difference between the two positions here, just like in the old days!

<blank>

As Ruly Deet was thinking these thoughts and smiling insinuatingly, a voice suddenly called out to him from behind.

<blank>

I think it's time for me to get into the classroom, okay?"

What? Oh, you!

<blank>

While most of the students were looking at us from a distance in front of the classroom, the other student approached us without any qualms.

Ruly's eyes widen at the sight of his opponent.

I'm sure of it! This guy is one of the cronies of the redhead!

And he's the one who made Katia call him a "magic wacko"!

When Ruly realized this, he stared at the person as hard as he could.

<blank>

"Yes? What can I do for you?"

You! What have you done to Katia?

What?" Who are you talking about?"

Don't play dumb with me! I know what you did to Katia!

'Hmmm, I don't know what you're talking about. ...... I think you have the wrong person."

This! Are you playing with me?

I'm not sure if I should go into the classroom either way. Either way, would it bother people if I didn't go into the classroom?"

"...... this guy!"

<blank>

There is no doubt that this guy did something to Katia.

And yet, the way they blithely ignore the questioning, even when I strongly questioned them about their words, makes me think that they are fooling themselves.

These red-headed fellows irritate me to the core!

<blank>

<blank>

Hmph! You're that red-headed pussy anyway, aren't you?

"Hmph, Sue and I are always together!"

<blank>

Tch!" Just as well! I'm going to remind you guys of the difference in degree!"

I'm not sure if you're familiar with ......."

Yeah?"

How can you say such sterile things so matter-of-factly?"

What?

'Normally you wouldn't be so smart to say something so stupid, would you?'

<blank>

What? You! You've got to be kidding me!

At first I thought you were just messing with me?"

You've got to be kidding me with your hubris!"

"Well, I guess we can't be too arrogant."

Don't talk nonsense!

<blank>

Mia spins her words in a fond tone from beginning to end, and Karen loses her color.

Ruly, on the other hand, is about to grab onto Mia at any moment.

<blank>

Eventually, the teacher in charge arrived shortly afterwards and the meeting had to be dismissed.

However, after the orientation, he obtained permission from the Josran teacher to have a mock fight with Mia.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

If I used magic in the mock battle, I would be able to show her, who cannot use magic, that I am what I am.

<blank>

In the locker room, where I went in first to get ready, I soaked his robe in water and smashed his cane.

<blank>

And yet! They put on their robes as if nothing had happened, and on top of that, they use magic without a wand!

<blank>

Why not?

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

Was it "position ......?"

<blank>

Mia whispers softly in Lurie's ear as her smile deepens.

<blank>

"Oh, you! You've always been outbursting your magic! How could this happen? ......"

<blank>

Ruly shouts hoarsely, as if he is not satisfied.

Mia, however, does not take it up, but squints her eyes and 'snaps' her right fingertip again as she lowers it.

<blank>

As if in response to the sound, thorny ivy grows up from the foot of the tree to Mia's palm.

The ivy then wove itself into one long rope in Mia's hands.

<blank>

Mia waved her wrist in a familiar fashion, and the long, woven ivy split the air and hit the ground with a high pitched thud.

Ruly's body reacts to the sound, and she jumps for a moment.

<blank>

I'll let you ...... understand a little bit about that 'position'."

<blank>

A ruthless light was implied in Mia's eyes.
