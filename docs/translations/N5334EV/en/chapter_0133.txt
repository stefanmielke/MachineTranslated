# Chapter 121: Rulii Deet's Miscalculation

Why has it come to this?

Rulii Deet was struggling to understand the current situation.

<b>

<b>

Why?

This guy shouldn't have been able to use magic.

<b>

In fact, I have seen him fail at magic multiple times with my own eyes.

He seemed to have been a topic of conversation among the new students for having the highest magical power, but if he can't use magic, it means nothing.

<b>

He's just a big wooden doll.

<b>

<b>

Every time I saw him sitting down after causing a magical explosion, I thought it served him right.

I should definitely be in a higher position than him, as I can use magic properly.

<b>

So how did it come to this?

<b>

<b>

Why can he use magic?

Moreover, he showed a magical barrier without holding a staff or chanting.

Not only that, but he had enough power to completely nullify the magic we cast.

<b>

I was told that if I could reduce the power of my barrier by half, it would be a success, yet how can something like this happen?

Furthermore, he is using wood attribute magic, which is a composite attribute, without chanting!

<b>

What in the world is going on?!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

Rulii Deet was letting out a silent scream as thorns constricted around his entire body.

In front of Rulii stood Mia Mathison, who approached with a quiet smile.

<b>

This guy is different.

This guy is in a realm that defies my understanding.

<b>

Rulii felt a chilling sensation at the sight of Mia, this existence beyond his comprehension.

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

That day, just after noon.

Rulii Deet arrived at the classroom of the magic department to take an elective course, accompanied by his two followers.

<b>

During the entrance exam, Rulii had recorded a score of "35" in fire attribute magic, so he thought it was only natural to choose the magic department.

A score of "35" in magical power is something to be proud of, considering that the average score for general examinees is around 20.

It's all within the "general range," though.

<b>

<b>

And now, in front of that classroom, Rulii felt a dark emotion rising from within him.

<b>

<b>

“……Karen!!!”

“…………Rulii”

<b>

With all his might, he glared at Karen Merlin standing before him.

<b>

“How dare you show your face in front of me like that!!”

“Wait! Rulii, I…”

“Shut up! It's all your fault!!!”

<b>

Every unpleasant event since coming to the academy was because of Karen Merlin, who stood right in front of him.

Rulii Deet was convinced of this from the bottom of his heart.

She had to pay for what she had done.

<b>

“Looks like you've completely forgotten your place, huh?!”

“……N-no…”

“Looks like you need a lesson on your position from the very beginning, right?! Hey?!”

<b>

Since they were in different classes, they hadn't been able to interact, but fortunately, it seemed they had chosen the same elective class.

Here, I will teach her the difference in our standings, just like before!

<b>

As Rulii entertained such thoughts and wore a dark smile, he was suddenly addressed from behind.

<b>

“Is it okay if we go into the classroom soon?”

“What?! Y-you!!”

<b>

Among the students mostly watching them from a distance in front of the classroom, the person who spoke did so without any hesitation.

Upon seeing that person, Rulii's eyes widened.

No doubt about it! This is one of the red-haired followers!

And the one who made Katia say "magic monster"!!

Realizing this, Rulii glared fiercely at the person.

<b>

“What? Do you need something from me?”

“You! What did you do to Katia?!!”

“Eh? Who are you talking about?”

“Don't play dumb! I know you did something to Katia!!”

“Umm, I don't really understand what you're saying... Maybe you're mistaking me for someone else?”

“Damn it! Are you trying to play dumb?!”

“Well, even if you say that... Either way, I have to go into the classroom, or it will be a nuisance to everyone around us, right?”

“……This guy!”

<b>

There's no doubt that this guy did something to Katia.

Yet, despite my strong questioning, he acts nonchalant, which makes me feel like he’s looking down on me.

These red-haired companions truly irritate me to no end!

<b>

<b>

“Hmph! You're just a lackey of that red-haired guy, aren't you?!”

“Hehe, I'm always with Sue-chan!”

<b>

“Tch!! Just perfect! I’ll show you the difference in levels!”

“……Honestly, I really don’t understand…”

“Oh?”

“Why you can say such futile things so easily?”

“Huh?!!”

“Normally, you wouldn’t be able to say something that sounds so stupid, right?”

<b>

“What?! You’re kidding me!!”

“At first, I thought you were the one joking around, you know?”

“Don’t get too full of yourself!!”

“Ummm, we can’t really afford to get too full of ourselves, you know?”

“I don’t get what you’re saying!!”

<b>

Mia spoke in a dazed tone, causing Karen to lose her color.

In contrast, Rulii looked ready to pounce on Mia at any moment.

<b>

In the end, shortly after, the supervising teacher arrived, and they were dispersed.

However, after the orientation, Rulii obtained permission from Teacher Joslan to have a mock battle with Mia.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

If I show my magic in the mock battle, I should be able to engrave my position into this guy who can't use magic.

<b>

In the locker room, I soaked his robe and even broke his staff.

<b>

And yet! He comes in wearing the robe as if nothing happened, and on top of that, he uses magic without a staff!

<b>

Why?!!

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“Position… was it?”

<b>

Mia whispered softly into Rulii's ear, deepening her smile.

<b>

“Y-you! You always caused magical explosions! W-why is this happening...”

<b>

Rulii shouted, his voice filled with disbelief.

However, Mia did not respond to that, narrowing her eyes and snapping her right fingers again.

<b>

In response to that sound, thorns began to rise from the ground toward Mia's palm.

The vines then wove together in her hand, forming a long rope-like structure.

<b>

Mia, with practiced ease, flicked her wrist, and the woven, elongated vine sliced through the air, striking the ground with a loud sound.

Rulii's body reacted to that sound, and he flinched for a moment.

<b>

“Let’s see if you can understand that 'position' a little…”

<b>

A merciless light flickered in Mia's eyes.
