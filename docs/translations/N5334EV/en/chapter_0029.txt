# Episode 29: A Guest of the Cloud Family

“Suzy Onee-sama! You’re going to the training ground today, right?”

<b>

Now that she has advanced to the 7th rank this month, Helena Slater, who has entered the higher tier, asked Suzy.

<b>

“Yeah, I’m going today. I’m looking forward to seeing how much everyone has improved during summer vacation…”

“What? Sister Suzy is coming!? Yay!!”

<b>

The one exclaiming this is Mary Frank, one of Victor's sisters, who is also at the 7th rank, just like Helena.

Mary then ran up and hugged Suzy.

<b>

“Hey! Why do you immediately hug like that?! That’s not fair!”

<b>

Saying that, Helena tightly hugged Suzy as well.

<b>

At first, Helena had shown a negative reaction towards Suzy when she enrolled, but after the last practice of the semester, she completely transformed into a devoted admirer of Suzy.

<b>

This must be the essence of the Amkam villagers who "respect the strong"… Suzy thought, smiling helplessly while placing her hands on the two.

<b>

“If Suzy is going, then I’ll go too…”

“No way, Mia! You need to teach the underclassmen!”

<b>

Colin, with his arms crossed over his chest, adjusted his glasses and coldly told Mia.

<b>

<b>

“But Colin and Vibi are here too…”

“You’re the only one in the higher tier who excels at offense since Arrows graduated! Both Vibi and I specialize in defense. We need to help Carl in a higher tier today!”

“But, but that means I can’t be with Suzy…”

“Do your best, Mia! If you’re kind and teach them, everyone will do their best too!”

<b>

Suzy said this encouragingly, wrapping her hands around Mia's.

<b>

“When we’re done, let’s go home together, okay?”

<b>

While tightly holding Mia's hands, Suzy gazed into her eyes.

<b>

“! Suzy… okay, I understand. I’ll do my best to teach everyone, so please wait for me, okay?”

“Mm!”

<b>

Suzy and Mia nodded at each other with smiles.

Watching them, Beatrice and Colin exchanged words with a look of exasperation.

<b>

“Sometimes the roles of guardians get reversed, huh?”

“Well, Suzy is basically more mature than us, so it can’t be helped.”

“W-what are you saying?! Suzy can’t function without me! No way!”

“Ah, yes yes, that’s right. Now let’s go, everyone’s waiting.”

“Ugh, come on!”

“See you, Suzy! Take care of things at the training ground! We’ll see you later!”

<b>

A rodent was about to squeak at Suzy from Beatrice's shoulder.

<b>

As Suzy waved goodbye to the three and one rodent, Helena grabbed her hand.

<b>

“Older sister! Let’s go quickly!”

<b>

And she was led by Helena towards the training ground.

<b>

<b>

At the training ground, the eldest, Lombard Blough, was overseeing the training of the underclassmen.

Normally, the top students, Dana and his classmate Irvin, were not here.

<b>

The two were currently running as much as possible every day at Suzy's suggestion.

<b>

<b>

This all started when Suzy pointed out that Dana and Irvin's "ki" was weaker compared to the two graduates during the last practice before summer break.

<b>

This still stems from the fact that the two have not been able to control magic properly yet…

<b>

Magic control is an essential skill even for front-line occupations.

By imbuing magic into equipment, they can enhance its performance and strengthen themselves.

Even the clone that Carla used was a result of magic control.

<b>

<b>

Dana has avoided practicing magic control until now due to his aversion to meditation.

But now, he is already a top student.

Being able to control magic is a prerequisite for entering the Dekkenbell High School next year.

If things continue like this, he won't be able to advance to the next school.

There is no turning back now.

<b>

Irvin is not an exception either.

These two are the only ones who cannot control magic at a high rank.

<b>

“Well, even if you say that… If you don’t meditate, you can’t progress, right? But when I meditate, I end up falling asleep…”

“Exactly! I fall asleep too! I really can’t stand being still…”

“In that case, I think it’s fine to do it while moving…”

"Eh?"

<b>

The two inadvertently responded in unison to Suzy's words.

<b>

“While running, focus your awareness inside your body without thinking about anything… The transfer of weight. The position of your center of gravity. Where in your body the strength is being applied. Where the strength is released. While feeling this, run. It’s fine to do it while walking too…”

“Is that really… okay?”

<b>

Irvin asked, his eyes wide with surprise.

<b>

“What’s important is not to think about unnecessary things. Just observe your own body without thinking about anything…”

“I’m great at running without thinking about anything! Is it really okay?! Alright! I’m going for a run!!”

“Wait up, Dana! I’m going too!!”

<b>

The two ran outside in delight as if scales had fallen from their eyes.

<b>

“Just as expected… The idea of doing it while running wouldn’t come from us, huh?”

“Well, I used to train extensively by walking or standing while focusing on my body. It’s important to be aware of this regularly!”

<b>

This exchange occurred on the first day of the new semester.

Since then, the two have continued their running practice every day.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Ah, Suzy. Are you here today?”

<b>

Lombard, who was handling the kids, noticed Suzy entering the training ground and called out to her.

<b>

“Mm! Lombard, thank you for your hard work!”

<b>

Suzy responded with a smile, tilting her head slightly at Lombard.

<b>

“Ah, yeah, hurry up and change. Since you’re here, I’d like to spar with you today.”

<b>

Lombard blushed at Suzy’s smile and, looking away, offered to spar with her.

<b>

“Sure, just a moment, okay?”

“...Yeah, there’s no need to rush…”

<b>

Lombard's face turned red at Suzy's additional smile.

<b>

<b>

Lombard Blough, who is the same age as Suzy and Irvin, is a tall boy already over 170 centimeters at the age of 13.

His muscular arms grip a rugged battle axe.

He is a power fighter, just as he appears.

<b>

His carrot-orange hair, which is cut wildly to shoulder length, and his deep-set blue eyes give him a kind expression.

<b>

This kind-hearted big guy, like something out of a picture, made Suzy think he was quite cute when he was embarrassed.

<b>

Covering her mouth with a chuckle, Suzy tried to suppress her laughter, while Helena looked up at her, tilting her head in suspicion.

<b>

<b>

“Ah! Suzy Onee!!”

<b>

In the training ground, a breathless Stefan collapsed, noticing Suzy and quickly getting back on his feet.

<b>

“Suzy! Are we doing it here? Then I want to fight! Quickly! Change!”

“Hey, hey, Stefan. You just said you couldn’t do it, didn’t you?”

“I-I didn’t say that! I can totally do it!! Suzy! Ron is lying! I’m perfectly fine!!”

<b>

While Lombard placed his hand on his forehead with a sigh...

<b>

“...You really like Suzy too much…”

<b>

He muttered.

<b>

“W-what?! That’s not it!! I wouldn’t do something like that! No way!!”

<b>

Stefan turned bright red and snapped at Lombard.

Suzy couldn't help but let out a chuckle.

<b>

“I understand, Stefan. I’ll make sure to take care of you, okay? So just wait a little…”

<b>

As she playfully winked and tilted her head with a smile.

<b>

Stefan froze on the spot, blushing, saying, “Ugh!”

<b>

“Suzy… you’re teasing me too much.”

<b>

Lombard said, shaking his head as if he had a headache.

<b>

“Ahaha♪ Sorry about that, okay?”

<b>

Suzy replied with a playful grin.

<b>

“Stop it! Suzy Onee-sama is going to be my partner! You two can wait!”

<b>

Helena declared while clinging to Suzy and glaring around threateningly.

That got Stefan fired up again.

<b>

“Helena can’t last more than five seconds! We always train together!”

“Then you won’t last even a second!”

<b>

Helena said, placing her hands on her hips and glaring at Stefan.

<b>

“I-I can last! I can totally last!!”

<b>

“Now, Suzy, let’s get changed quickly?”

<b>

Mary urged, pulling Suzy towards the changing room.

As they moved, Suzy glanced around the training ground to check on the kids inside.

<b>

She saw Lombard looking exasperatedly at the arguing Helena and Stefan.

<b>

Clark and Ashton, the twins who were rolling around with Stefan, also got up.

<b>

Irma Atlee and Janice Karoff, who have both advanced to the 4th rank this term, noticed Suzy and joyfully squealed.

<b>

David Blake and Charles Beaumont, the two boys who sat with Leila and Mabel on the first day of school, were being taught sword techniques by Frank Zilight, who was one grade up, and all three looked pleased to see her.

<b>

At the entrance, Bernap Long and Alan Edgar, Carla’s younger brother, who have also moved up to a higher tier this term, brought along Beatrice's brother Edward Croki and the fraternal twins Eva and Valet Avans.

All three looked excited.

<b>

In front of the changing room, Phoebe Kites, who was in the 3rd rank, and Dennis Hawtry, who was in the 4th rank and had been with her in a study group yesterday, also noticed that they were in the training ground.

Both were running towards the changing room.

<b>

“Wait? You two are here today?”

“Yeah, we heard Suzy Onee-chan was here, so we came over!”

<b>

As Phoebe said this, Dennis nodded silently.

<b>

“Okay, then let’s hurry and change!”

<b>

Suzy stroked both their heads and headed into the changing room. Being surrounded by lively children makes her feel genuinely happy.

Suzy felt a modest happiness.

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

When she got home, she saw a figure leading Regulus to the stable.

<b>

(It's Gilberto. Howard used the carriage today. I didn’t hear anything special, but he must have gone out.)

<b>

Gilberto is a part-time servant of the Cloud family, mainly responsible for taking care of the horses and handling outside chores.

<b>

He is a small, elderly man in his 70s with an eyepatch over his right eye, yet he is spry and quite lively.

He often calls Suzy “Miss” and frequently gives her candies when he sees her.

<b>

Noticing Suzy's return, Gilberto waved happily as she said “I’m home.”

<b>

Waving back, she entered the house and heard voices from the living room.

In addition to Howard and Sonia, there was a young man's voice she had never heard before.

She sensed a strong, youthful, gentle presence.

The atmosphere in the living room seemed very cheerful.

<b>

“...I’m back.”

<b>

Suzy peeked into the living room to greet them upon her return, and immediately heard “Ah, welcome back, Suzy,” and similar greetings from the adults.

<b>

Then, another person, who had been laughing with Howard and Sonia while facing away, turned slowly to look at Suzy.

<b>

“!… L-Lavi-nee! What?! Why?! Lavi… oh.”

<b>

As soon as she saw Suzy, he opened his eyes wide, stood up, and exclaimed in surprise.

However, he quickly realized that the person before him was different from the one he had just named and lowered his gaze.

<b>

“A-actually, I’m Suzy. Nice to meet you…”

“Ah… I’m sorry. Nice to meet you, I’m William Cloud. I’ve heard about you from the two. I apologize for being rude and sudden.”

“...Please, don’t worry about it.”

<b>

Howard and Sonia looked at Suzy with pained expressions.

<b>

(Oh, I don’t want to see those faces from the two… not at all.)

<b>

“Um, I’m going to change in my room. Excuse me.”

“Ah…”

<b>

William opened his mouth to try to stop her, but Suzy quickly went upstairs.

<b>

“Will, I’ll talk to her. You stay here with Howard.”

“Yes, Aunt, I’m sorry. My shallow words have caused discomfort to everyone.”

<b>

William bowed deeply to the two.

Sonia smiled and told him, “It’s alright,” as she left the living room.

Following her, Howard spoke to William.

<b>

“Don’t worry about it, Will. This was our fault for being cowardly. We should have talked with her sooner after she decided to live here with us. This is a good opportunity.”

“However, Uncle…”

“Sit down, Will. Let’s leave the rest to Sonia. Elrose, could you get me another cup of tea?”

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

******************************

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

“Ughhh… that was a bit rude, wasn’t it?”

<b>

Now Suzy was dressed in light indoor clothing, having changed and slipped into indoor slippers, and had collapsed onto the bed on her back.

<b>

(After escaping so abruptly, I wonder if the guest took offense?)

<b>

She felt a bit down.

<b>

(But I couldn’t leave them with those expressions…)

<b>

The name “Lavi” came up again.

If seeing me reminds them of that person, I need to keep my face hidden for now, she thought, and immediately went upstairs.

<b>

“Maybe I was too cold? …I could have said something better…”

<b>

She reflected on this.

After taking some time to gather her thoughts, she decided to go downstairs once the two had calmed down.

<b>

Just then, a light knock echoed on the door.

<b>

(Is that Elrose? I wonder what it is? An urgent matter?)

<b>

“Okay, I’m coming!” (But that presence?)

<b>

Saying this, she put on an apron, walked to the door, placed her hand on the doorknob, and slowly opened it.

<b>

“! Sonia?!”

<b>

Sonia stood at the door.

<b>

“What?! Sonia? Why did you come upstairs?”

<b>

Suzy stretched her hand out towards Sonia in a panic.

<b>

“Don’t worry, Suzy. I’m fine with this.”

“But your leg! You’re out of breath! Sonia, you’re tired!”

<b>

Sonia was slightly out of breath and had a hint of redness in her cheeks.

<b>

“Is that so? Then let me sit for a bit.”

“Of course!”

<b>

Restraining Suzy, Sonia wished to sit on the bed.

<b>

Suzy handed Sonia a glass of water from the pitcher, and Sonia slowly quenched her thirst.

Confirming that Sonia had calmed down, Suzy also relaxed.

<b>

After Sonia returned the glass to Suzy, she patted the left side of her own body and urged Suzy to sit next to her.

<b>

"Sonia, why something like this...?"

“I wanted to talk to you, Suzy… Is that okay?”

<b>

Sonia gently interrupted Suzy’s question with her soft gaze, expressing her wishes.

<b>

“No, it’s fine. I also want to hear what you have to say, Sonia.”

<b>

Seeing the calm yet determined spirit in Sonia's eyes, Suzy nodded quietly.

<b>

“Actually, I should have talked to you much earlier. When you decided to live in this house with us, I should have properly discussed it with you.”

“...Sonia.”

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“...We were afraid. When we learned about Lavi, we worried that she might leave this house. Would she drift away from us? …That kind of thing.”

“...Uncle, is she really the type of girl who would do something so unfeeling?”

“No! That’s not it. …It’s not like that, Will. She’s very intelligent, thoughtful, and above all, kind-hearted.”

<b>

“Then why would she do something that seems like abandoning you?”

“She probably already knows about Lavi.”

“Does that mean someone told her about it?”

“No, I don’t think so. It’s just that people who have seen her, just like you did earlier, have mentioned Lavi’s name in front of her. A few have done so.”

<b>

“...I’m really sorry for that…”

“Don’t worry about it. It shows that we loved her... Lavi that much.”

“...”

<b>

“So far, the only person who has asked Suzy about Lavi is Rider Haggard. He was asked by Suzy and couldn’t answer... He came all the way to apologize for mentioning Lavi in front of Suzy without thinking.”

“That... I understand how Rider feels. I’m really sorry.”

“That’s fine, really. You and Rider are both honest men, huh? Maybe everyone connected to the knight order is like that, ha ha.”

“Uh, well, I’m not sure about that…”

<b>

“Suzy has only asked once about Lavi and hasn’t asked anyone else. She must have noticed how everyone looks pained when Lavi’s name is mentioned.”

<b>

<b>

◇

<b>

<b>

“...Suzy knows about Lavi, doesn’t she?”

<b>

Sonia's eyes wavered slightly.

Noticing this, Suzy placed her hand over Sonia's hand, which she was gripping on her lap.

<b>

“Thank you, Suzy... You really know, don’t you?”

<b>

Suzy nodded while looking into Sonia's eyes.

<b>

“Perhaps, she was someone who lived in this house long ago… I think.”

“Why do you think that?”

“When I first came to this house, the clothes you gave me, the underwear, and the small items. I wondered if there was a girl my age… but she hasn’t been around for many years.”

“I see... that makes sense.”

<b>

“Sometimes, people confuse me with her and call me by her name. Do I... look like her?”

<b>

“Hmm, yes, I think she was about your height. She always wore her red hair in a single braid that hung down her back. Her eyes were the same greenish hue as mine, sometimes sparkling like emeralds. She was self-conscious about her wide forehead, but I liked it. She was always lively and running around outside, not losing to the boys.”

<b>

As she spoke joyfully, tears began to well up in Sonia's eyes.

<b>

“Don’t cry, Sonia! I’m sorry. It’s okay now… please don’t cry!”

“No, it’s not that; I’m fine, okay? Thank you, Suzy. I didn’t expect to talk about Lavi so happily… I’m so glad.”

“...Sonia.”

“So please listen to me until the end, okay?”

“...Yes.”

<b>

“Lavi, Lavinia Cloud, is our daughter. She passed away at the age of 14, ten years ago. She was our beloved only child, loved by Howard and me.”
