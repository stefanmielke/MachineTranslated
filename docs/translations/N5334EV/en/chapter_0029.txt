# 29 The Rare Guests of the Cloud Family

"Sister Suzy, you're at the training center today, aren't you? I know you're in the training hall today."

<blank>

Helena Slater, who has been promoted to the 7th dan this month and has entered the higher ranks, asked Susie.

<blank>

I'll be there today. I can't wait to see how strong you guys have gotten over the summer vacation, okay?"

What? Sister Sue is coming! YATTER!!!!"

<blank>

So cheered Mary Frank, one of Victor's sisters and a 7th dan like Helena.

Mary came straight to Susie in a hug.

<blank>

Why do you hug me like that? Why do you hug me right away like that? It's not fair!"

<blank>

Helena also hugged Suzy in a tight embrace.

<blank>

Helena, who had shown rejection of Suzy when she first joined the school, was now completely transformed into an admirer of Suzy's after the final meeting of the semester.

<blank>

Is this the essence of the villagers of Amkam, who 'respect the strong' ......? The two were laughing and putting their hands together.

<blank>

If Sue is going, so am I. ......

No Mia, you have to teach the underclassmen! You have to teach the underclassmen!"

<blank>

Colin tells Mia with his arms crossed over his chest and a quick lift of his glasses and a cold look in his eyes.

<blank>

<blank>

That's not true, even though Colin and Bibi are both there. ......

You're the only one in the higher ranks who's good at offense now that the Arrows have graduated, right?" Both Bibi and I specialize in defense. Especially for Karl, who has been in the higher ranks since this semester, today is the day I have to teach him!"

But then Sue and ......

Mia, good luck! If Mia can teach us kindly, I think we can all do our best!

<blank>

Suzy wraps Mia's hands in hers and speaks encouragingly to her.

<blank>

When you're done, we'll go home together, okay?"

<blank>

And Suzy stares into Mia's eyes as she squeezes Mia's hand that was wrapped around hers.

<blank>

I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not! Sue-chan ...... Umm, I understand. I'll do my best to teach you guys, just wait for me, okay?"

Nope!"

<blank>

Suzy and Mia smiled and nodded to each other.

Beatrice and Colin exchange a few words as they look on in amazement.

<blank>

Sometimes the guardians turn the tables!"

Well, basically, Sue has a higher mental age than I do. It can't be helped."

What are you talking about? Sue-chan is no good without me! No!

"Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Let's go then, we're all waiting for you."

Mooooooooo!"

See you later, Sue! Take care of the training ground! See you later!"

<blank>

From Beatrice's shoulder, the rodent's eyes also squeak to Suzy.

<blank>

As I fluttered my hands and waved them off, three of them and one of them, Helena grabbed my hand.

<blank>

Sister! Let's go quickly!"

<blank>

and proceeded by hand to the training hall.

<blank>

<blank>

In the training hall, Lombard Burok, the oldest man here, is now taking care of the training of the underclassmen.

Dana, who is essentially the most senior student, and Irvin, who is a classmate of Dana's, are not here.

<blank>

They are now doing as much running as possible every day for as long as they can at Suzy's suggestion.

<blank>

<blank>

It originally started when Suzy pointed out that Dana and Irving's kiatsu was weaker than that of the two graduates during a hand-me-down before the summer vacation.

<blank>

This still stems from the fact that the two of them are still not able to manipulate magic properly. ......

<blank>

Magic manipulation is an important and essential skill, even in the vanguard position.

By putting magic power into their equipment, they can raise the performance of the equipment and strengthen themselves.

The alter ego used by Kara is also the result of magical manipulation.

<blank>

<blank>

Dana has always avoided training in magical manipulation because of her dislike of meditation.

But now they are the most senior students.

The ability to manipulate magic is a prerequisite for admission to De Kembel's high school, which is coming up next year.

If this is not done, they will not be able to go on to higher education.

There is no more time left.

<blank>

Irving is no stranger to this.

They are the only ones who cannot manipulate magic at higher ranks.

<blank>

I don't get it. You can't go on without meditating, right? I fall asleep when I meditate. ......"

I'm going to sleep too! I fall asleep too! I'm not good at sitting still for some reason. ......"

Then I think it's better if we do it while we're moving ...

Huh?"

<blank>

Suzy's words made both of them listen back together.

<blank>

"Don't think about anything, just run and be aware of your body.... The shift of weight. The position of the center of gravity. Where in your body is your strength? Where is the strength in the body being relaxed? Feel while you run. You can do it while walking, too... right?

Is that how you want to ...... it?"

<blank>

Irving rolls his eyes and asks.

<blank>

The important thing is not to think about anything else. The important thing is not to think about anything else, but to just observe your body.

I'm great at running without thinking! That's how you do it! I'm going for a run! I'm going for a run!

Oh! Wait, Dana! I'm coming with you!

<blank>

The two of them are so delighted that they run out of the house.

<blank>

I'm impressed with the idea of running ...... while running. We never thought of that before.

Once upon a time, I used to train myself to be aware of the inside of my body while walking and standing. It is important to be aware of this on a daily basis.

<blank>

The first day of the new school year was the first day of the exchange.

Since then, they have been running together every day.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Oh, Susie. You're in Koch today?"

<blank>

Lombardo, who was working with the children, noticed Suzy coming into the training hall and came over to speak to her.

<blank>

Ng! Lombard, good job!"

<blank>

To Lombardo, Susie smiles and replies with a tilt of her head.

<blank>

I'm going to ask you to go and get dressed. I want you to make a move with me today."

<blank>

Suzy's smile hit me, and I shifted my gaze, scratched my cheek with my fingertips, and offered to meet for a handshake.

<blank>

"Huh, okay? Just wait here for a minute, okay?"

"......Yeah, don't panic, it's ...... fine."

<blank>

Lombard blushes at Suzy's further smile.

<blank>

<blank>

Lombard Blouk is the same age as Suzy and Irvin, but at 13 years old, he is already a large boy, over 170 centimeters tall.

A muscular arm grips a martial battle axe.

He is as much a power fighter as he looks.

<blank>

Her shoulder-length, carrot-orange, cropped hair is wild, and her deep, nasal digs are a gentle, clear blue.

<blank>

Suzy thought it was cute how he looked like the picture of a big man with a kind heart, and how he was so bashful.

<blank>

Helena looked up from the side, tilting her head quizzically at Suzy, who was holding her mouth and trying to hold back a smile.

<blank>

<blank>

Ah! Sister Sue!

<blank>

Stefan, who had fallen down in the kneading area, breathing hard, noticed Suzy and got up with a gulp and shouted.

<blank>

Sue," she said! You want to do it over here? Then you're going to do it with me! With me! Hurry up and get dressed! Get dressed!

"Oh, come on, Stefan. Didn't you just say you're screwed?"

I didn't say that! I didn't say that! I can do it! Sue! Ron, you're lying! I'm fine!

<blank>

Lombardo puts his right hand on his forehead and exhales a sigh. ......

<blank>

"...... you like Suzy too much ......"

<blank>

He muttered.

<blank>

I'm not going to be able to do it! It's not like that! It's not like that! That's enough! Ron! Get out of the way! Sue's coming, get out of the way!

<blank>

Stefan turns red and takes a bite out of Lombardo.

Suzy couldn't help but let out a giggle.

<blank>

I'll take good care of you, okay, Stefan? I'll take good care of you, okay? Just give me a minute, okay?"

<blank>

Suzy winked at the prankster, tilted her head and smiled.

<blank>

Stefan turned red and stiffened on the spot!　and turned bright red and stiffened on the spot.

<blank>

Susie ...... teases too much."

<blank>

Then Lombardo puts his hand on his forehead and shakes his head, as if his head hurts.

<blank>

"Hahaha...sorry, huh?"

<blank>

Suzy is a very nice person.

<blank>

Oh my God! Susie will deal with me, and I will deal with you afterwards! I'll deal with you afterwards!"

<blank>

Helena declared as she clung to Suzy and looked menacingly around her.

Stefan receives it and restarts it.

<blank>

He/she can't even last five seconds! We'll always be together!

You wouldn't last a second, would you?"

<blank>

Helena puts her hands on her hips and glares at Stefan.

<blank>

And "too! I'll hold it! I'll totally hold it!

<blank>

Right? Sis Sue, let's change quickly, shall we?"

<blank>

Mary urged me to go to the changing rooms and led me by the hand.

As she proceeds, Suzy takes a quick look around the training hall and checks on the children inside.

<blank>

Lombardo looks at Helena and Stefan, who are arguing with each other, as if he is disgusted.

<blank>

The twins, Clark and Ashton, who had been lying with Stefan, also woke up.

<blank>

Irma Utley, who noticed Suzy and has moved up to the fourth level this term, and Janice Karloff are cackling with delight.

<blank>

On the first day of school, Leila, Mabel, and the two boys who shared a desk with them, David Blake and Charles Beaumant, were being taught swordsmanship by Frank Gieright, one of the older students, and all three looked happy to see us.

<blank>

At the entrance, Belknap Long and Carla's brother Alan Edgarra, who, like Helena and her friends, had moved up to a higher rank this term, brought Beatrice's brother, Edward Kroki, who had just been admitted, and her two identical twin sisters, Eva and Valette Avans.

All three look excited.

<blank>

In front of the entrance to the locker room, I noticed that Phoebe Kaitz, a 3rd dan, and Dennis Whatley, a 4th dan, who had been in the study group with me yesterday, were also in the training hall.

They both come running toward the locker room.

<blank>

"Huh? Are you two, uh, kochi today?"

I heard Suzy was going this way, so I came this way!"

<blank>

Phoebe said, and Dennis nodded silently.

<blank>

Okay, well, let's get dressed, shall we?"

<blank>

I pat them on the head and walk into the changing room.　I knew they were all so cute and energetic. Being surrounded by lively children makes me happy in itself.

Suzy felt a small happiness.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

When I returned home, I saw a figure taking Regulus to the stables.

<blank>

(It's Mr. Gilbert. Howard, you used the carriage today. I didn't hear anything special about it, but you were out.)

<blank>

Gilberto is the Cloud family's go-to servant who mainly takes care of the horses and does outside work. Gilberto is a commuter servant of the Cloud family who mainly takes care of the horses and does outside work.

<blank>

He is a small, lanky old man with one eye and an eyepatch over his right eye, but he is hale and hearty, and truly a vivacious person.

She calls Susie "Miss, Miss, Miss" and often gives her candy bars when she sees her.

<blank>

Gilberto also seemed to notice Suzy's return, so I waved to him and he waved back happily.

<blank>

Waving his hand, he enters the house and hears talking from the living room.

Besides Howard and Sonia, there was one other voice I had never heard before, a young male voice.

A search for signs reveals a strong, youthful, calm temperament.

The atmosphere in the living room is very joyful.

<blank>

I'm home. I'm home.

<blank>

When Susie came into the living room to greet her return home, the adults immediately returned the greeting, "Welcome home, Susie, welcome home, Miss, welcome home.

<blank>

Another young man, who was chatting with Howard and Sonia with his back to us, also noticed Suzy and turned around with a yukkuri.

<blank>

"! ...... La, sister Ravi! Why! Why? LaVey, I'm ...... ah."

<blank>

The moment he saw Suzy, he stood up with his eyes wide open, and he was astonished.

However, he immediately realizes that the person in front of him is a different person from the one who just called his name and drops his eyes.

<blank>

Oh, um, I'm Suzy. Nice to meet you..."

Oh ...... sorry. Nice to meet you, I am William Cloud. I've heard about you from both of you. I apologize for my abruptness and rudeness."

Don't worry about it.

<blank>

Howard and Sonia look at Suzy with pained expressions.

<blank>

(Oh, also these eyes ....... I don't really want to see you two like this ......)

<blank>

Uh, I'm going to go to my room and change, if you'll excuse me."

Oh, ......."

<blank>

William opened his mouth to stall her, but Suzy was gone upstairs before he could.

<blank>

Will, I'll go talk to him. You stay here with Howard, okay?"

I am sorry, Aunt. My shallow remarks made you all feel uncomfortable."

<blank>

William bows deeply to them.

Sonia smiled, said she was fine, and left the living room.

Howard spoke to William to take over.

<blank>

Don't be alarmed, Will. This is our fault for being timid. We should have talked to him earlier. This is a good opportunity.

But, Uncle. I..."

Sit down, Will. Let Sonia take care of the rest. Elrose, can I have some more tea?"

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

******************************

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

'Ummm...that was a bit rude, wasn't it?'

<blank>

Now Susie has changed into light-fabric indoor clothes, removed her boots, and is lying on her back on the bed with her feet in her indoor shoes.

<blank>

(I hope you weren't offended by my leaving earlier.)

<blank>

I am a little depressed thinking about it.

<blank>

(But I couldn't leave them both with that look on their faces. ......)

<blank>

The name 'Ravi' has come up again.

I went upstairs immediately, thinking that I had to pull my face back if I was going to be associated with that person when he saw me. ......

<blank>

"A little too blunt? I could have said it a little better, you know..."

<blank>

He reflected on the situation.

Let's give it some time and try to get down there when you two have calmed down. ...... I was just thinking about it.

<blank>

Then there was a light knock on the door.

<blank>

(Huh? Is that Mr. Elrose? What is it? Something urgent?)

<blank>

Yes, I'll open it now." (Huh?) But this sign?)

<blank>

With that said, he walked to the door, putting on his apron, put his hand on the doorknob, and yukked the door open.

<blank>

"! Ms. Sonia!

<blank>

Sonia was standing in front of the door.

<blank>

Why? Sonia? Up the stairs?

<blank>

Susie hurriedly reaches out to Sonia.

<blank>

I'm fine, Susie. I'm fine.

But my legs! I'm out of breath! Ms. Sonia, you're tired!"

<blank>

Sonia was breathing a little unevenly, and her cheeks had a pleasant reddish tinge.

<blank>

"Yeah? Well, I guess I'll just have to sit down for a minute, then."

Of course!"

<blank>

She wanted to sit on the bed.

<blank>

She hands Sonia a glass of water from the pitcher as she sits on the bed, and Sonia quenches her thirst with it.

After confirming that Sonia had calmed down, Susie also got comfortable.

<blank>

Sonia handed the cup back to Suzy and patted her left side, encouraging Suzy to sit beside her.

<blank>

Sonia, how could you do this to me?

I wanted to talk to Susie. Do you think ...... is a bad idea?"

<blank>

Sonia controls Suzy's questioning and conveys her own hopes with a soft look in her eyes.

<blank>

I want to hear your story, too. I want to hear your story, too.

<blank>

Suzy saw the calm but firm will in Sonia's eyes and nodded quietly in return.

<blank>

I really should have spoken to you earlier. I should have told you when you decided to come and live with me in this house.

Sonia...

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

We were scared. We were afraid that when she found out about Ravi, she would leave this house. "We were afraid that when he found out about Ravi, he would leave the house. Would she leave us? We were afraid that she would leave us. ......

"Uncle ......, is she the kind of daughter who would do such a ......, such a heartless thing?"

No, it's not! It's not. It's ...... different, Will. That boy is very intelligent, thoughtful, and just plain kind."

<blank>

Then why would you do something like abandon your uncles?

Perhaps the boy is already aware of Ravi.

Is that what you're saying, that someone told her?"

No, I didn't tell you. Sonia and others who saw her, like you just now, mentioned Lavi's name at the first sight. There are only a few of them.

<blank>

Well, I'm sorry to return that ......"

I'm not worried about it. It just shows that you loved her ...... and Ravi that much."

"............"

<blank>

He was asked by Suzy about Ravi, but only one person, Ryder Haggard, ever asked him. He was asked by Suzy and couldn't answer ....... He came all the way to my house to apologize to me for calling Ravi's name in front of Suzy.

"I know how you feel, ...... and I know how you feel too, Mr. Ryder. I am truly sorry."

So you say it's good, but pfft. You and your rider are both honest men, aren't you? Maybe everyone involved in the Order is like that.

No, no, it's ......, how about, how about...?"

<blank>

Suzy only asked Ryder once and no one else about Ravi. She must have noticed how everyone who mentioned Ravi's name seemed to give her a hard time.

<blank>

<blank>

◇ ◇

<blank>

<blank>

"...... Suzy must know about ...... Ravi, right?"

<blank>

Sonia's eyes shook slightly.

Suzy notices this and lays her hand on Sonia's hand, which she holds in her lap.

<blank>

"Thanks Susie ....... I knew you knew that, didn't I?"

<blank>

Suzy looked Sonia in the eye and nodded.

<blank>

I think it might be someone who used to live here.

What makes you say that?"

'The clothes you put out for me when I first came to your house. The underwear, the accessories. There was a girl about the same age...? But she's been gone for years."

So ......, yes."

<blank>

Sometimes people mistake me for that person and call me. Do I ... look like him?

<blank>

I was about the same height as you are now. She always wore her red hair in a single braid down her back. Her eyes were an ashy green like mine, but sometimes they glittered like emeralds. She had a wide forehead, which bothered her, but I liked it. She was always running around outside with so much energy, even the boys would get to her."

<blank>

Tears well up in Sonia's eyes as she speaks happily.

<blank>

Sonia, Sonia! Don't cry! I'm sorry. That's enough ... I'm sorry, don't cry!"

No, no, no, it's okay. Thank you Susie. I'm not sad. I'm not sad, okay? I'm just happy ...... to be able to talk about Ravi in such a fun way."

Sonia...

So just hear me out, okay?"

Yes.

<blank>

Lavi, Lavinia Cloud is our daughter, the one and only beloved daughter that Howard and I loved when she passed away 10 years ago at the age of 14."
