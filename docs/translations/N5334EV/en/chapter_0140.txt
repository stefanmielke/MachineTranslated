# Chapter 128: Fluke's Tantrum

“Damn it!! Damn it!!!”

<b>

Fluke kicked the large desk repeatedly, his well-groomed face contorting as he cursed. The thick, lavishly decorated desk shook and made noise each time.

<b>

“Don’t mess with me!! You damn brat!!!”

<b>

What the hell is that dangerous brat doing here!?

What is he!?

If I had drawn my knife, I would have definitely been done for.

That bastard was provoking me to draw my knife from the very beginning!

This isn’t a joke! Damn it!!

<b>

“Don’t let yourselves get taken down so easily, you worthless scum!”

“Y-yes! I’m sorry!”

<b>

Grabbing a glass from the desk, he threw it at the men who were bowing around the desk in irritation.

The thick glass hit one man on the head, scattering amber liquid and larger ice cubes around, staining the long-haired carpet.

<b>

“What’s going on with that manager over there?! Why isn’t he here?!!”

“W-well, I heard there was a shipment last week…”

“I thought he might be hanging around the racetrack…”

“You scum! Damn it!! I don’t care who! Bring that old man or woman here!!! Right now! Go!! You bastard!!!”

<b>

With Fluke’s shouting, the four men who had been bowing on the floor rushed to the door, their footsteps echoing in a hurry as they left.

<b>

“Parker!!”

“Y-yes!!!”

<b>

A young man standing pale-faced next to the door, startled by Fluke’s outburst, jumped and straightened his posture at the sudden call.

<b>

“Parker, you bring those twin brats from the facility here.”

“W-what? Me?”

“This damn thing!! Of course it’s you?! Don’t you understand what I’m saying?!! Huh?!!”

“Yikes! I-I’m so sorry!!!”

<b>

Kicking the desk hard, the heavy desk moved slightly with a loud noise.

At that sound, Parker instinctively flinched and covered his head.

<b>

This was the first time Parker had seen Fluke show such rage.

He was used to seeing Fluke in nice clothes surrounded by women, acting like a generous older brother.

Even so, he used women for business and casually discarded them for money. Parker had seen many women disappear like that. To Fluke, women were nothing more than tools.

He understood that Fluke was someone dangerous when angered.

Just remembering how he had violently dealt with the man who had tried to take a woman away made him shiver.

In the end, he hadn’t heard what happened to those two afterward, but it was easy to imagine it wasn’t anything good.

<b>

Now, the terrifying Fluke’s anger was directed at him, something he couldn’t have imagined just a little while ago.

<b>

“Listen up! Do you have any idea how much it cost to get you and the soldiers I lent out of the detention center because of your screw-up? Huh?!!”

“I-I’m sorry!”

“I told you we’re short on manpower!! You made me spend unnecessary time and money! You damn thing!! Be a little useful! You worthless piece of trash!!”

“I-I’m so sorry!!”

“I’ll send 2 or 3 guys who are free. Listen, you must bring them back before sunset! Got it?! Before sunset!!”

“Y-yes!”

“If you understand, then get the hell out of here! You slowpoke!!!”

“Y-yes!!!”

<b>

Parker hurriedly left the room, tripping over the carpet.

Fluke clicked his tongue loudly, glaring at the thick door the men had rushed out of, cursing under his breath to no one in particular.

<b>

It was truly frustrating.

Originally, he had planned to forcibly take that girl away today and enjoy himself to the fullest.

What the hell is this mess?!

It felt like a lie that he had been daydreaming about tonight’s pleasures and celebrating with his subordinates during the day.

All of this was because of that brat!!

<b>

In anger, he stomped hard on the floor.

The thud reverberated around him.

<b>

To be able to play with a student from Miria was something that was normally unthinkable.

Even the people from Dekkenberg's red-light district said they had never dealt with them.

In fact, they seemed to avoid getting involved with Miria’s students altogether.

Yet, that girl had come rolling into his lap.

For Fluke, there was no reason not to take action.

<b>

And just when he was finally about to get his hands on her, that brat had to show up!!

<b>

Stomping again, the heavy vibrations echoed around.

<b>

However, he also understood that he was trembling at the memory of that gaze.

That made him even more frustrated.

<b>

Damn it! Damn it!! Fluke continued to stomp on the floor with all his might.

<b>

<b>

Downstairs, Parker was gathering people according to Fluke’s orders, looking up at the heavy sounds echoing above him, his face drained of color.
