# 128 Fluke's Clog

Fuck! Fuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

<blank>

The large desk is kicked repeatedly, and Fluke swears, his well-toned face contorted. The thick, ornately decorated office desk shakes and clatters several times each time.

<blank>

Don't fuck with me! You fucking brat!

<blank>

Why is there a brat like that?

What the hell is that guy?

If Koch had pulled out a knife, he would have been absolutely killed.

That son of a bitch was trying to get me to pull the knife out from the beginning!

You gotta be kidding me! You son of a bitch!

<blank>

Don't let them get to you so easily, you scum! You scum!"

Hi! I'm sorry."

<blank>

He grabbed a glass on the desk and threw it at the men lying flat around the desk in an irritated manner.

A thick glass hit one man on the head, scattering amber liquid and sizable ice cubes around the area and creating a stain on the long-haired carpet.

<blank>

What's going on with the janitor over there? Why isn't he there?

I was, maybe, because you said you had a shipment last week ......"

I thought you'd be in and out of the racetrack by now ......"

"Rubbish! Kuso! I don't care who it is! Get that old hag out of here! Now! Go! You motherfucker!

<blank>

With a yell from Fluke, the four men who had been lying flat on the floor went to the door in their own rush and left with a flurry of footsteps.

<blank>

Parker!

Hey, hey!

<blank>

The young man standing by the door, his face paling from Fluke's sword fight, suddenly shakes and straightens his posture at the call.

<blank>

"Hey, Parker, go get the twin kids from the shelter."

What? Oh, me?"

You son of a bitch! Don't you get it? Don't you understand what I'm saying? Do you not understand what I'm saying?

Hiccup! I'm so sorry!

<blank>

He kicks the desk as hard as he can, and the heavy desk moves slightly with a violent noise.

At the sound, Parker was startled and quickly turned his head.

<blank>

Parker had never seen Fluke express so much anger.

Parker was a familiar face to him, always dressed in good clothes, surrounded by women, and surrounded by his generous brother.

Still, he used women for business and used them up with impunity and turned them into money. Parker, too, had seen many women disappear in this way. To Fluke, women are nothing more than tools.

I also knew that he was a bad person if I made him angry.

I shudder just to think of the woman who tried to escape and the rampage that ensued when she directly shagged the man who took her out.

In the end, Parker was never told what happened to the two after that, but as far as he was concerned, it was easy to imagine that it was not a good thing.

<blank>

Now, I could not have imagined a moment ago that the wrath of that terrible fluke would be directed at me in this way.

<blank>

You know what? Do you know how much it cost me to get you and your loaned soldiers out of jail because of your mismanagement? Aah!

I'm sorry!

I told you we're short on staff! You're making me spend extra time and money! You son of a bitch! Help yourself! You rag and scrap!

Also! I'm sorry!

I'll put two or three guys on you who are available. Listen, make sure you bring them in before the sun goes down! You understand? Before the sun goes down!

Yes!

"If you know what you're doing, get out of here! You're a fucking retard!

Is! Yes!!!!"

<blank>

Parker left the room in a great hurry, his feet caught in the carpet.

Staring at the thick door through which the men had left in a great hurry, Fluke clicked his tongue loudly and swore at no one.

<blank>

It's really frustrating.

Originally, I had planned to forcefully take her away today and enjoy myself as much as possible.

So what is this?

It was as if I had been having fun with my minions during the day, envisioning the pleasures of the night.

It's all because of that brat!

<blank>

In a fit of rage, he stomped the floor as hard as he could.

Thud! and a vibration is felt in the area.

<blank>

Being able to play with the girls in Milia is something that would not normally be possible.

The story goes that even the colorful street people in Dekenberger have never taken them on.

In fact, they are even evasive about messing with Milia's students.

It came tumbling down from the other side.

For Fluke, there is no reason to stay out of it.

<blank>

And just when I was finally going to get that today, that brat!

<blank>

A heavy vibration echoes around the area again as it is trampled on.

<blank>

But I also understand that there is a part of me that is frightened when I remember those eyes.

That is even more annoying.

<blank>

Shit! Fuck! and Fluke continues to stomp the floor with all his might, over and over again.

<blank>

<blank>

Downstairs, Parker, following Fluke's instructions to gather people, looked up, his face colorless, at the top of his head, which continued to echo with a heavy sound.
