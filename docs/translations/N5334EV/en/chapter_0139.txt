# Chapter 127: Arvin Haggard Probes

"Hey, you can come out now, you know?"

<b>

With a painful groan, four men are rolling on the cobblestones.

Arvin, looking down at them, called out to a figure hiding in the shadow of the building.

<b>

Up to this point, Arvin had not drawn his sword.

At first, when he called out to a man standing by the entrance of the facility, the man suddenly grabbed him by the collar, so Arvin immediately twisted his arm and delivered a light blow to his side, causing him to roll onto the ground.

Seeing this, the other men, who seemed to be his companions, came out one after another, shouting, and with the same light blow, all of them ended up rolling as well.

<b>

Now, Arvin had just called out to the one person who had not yet come out.

<b>

In response to Arvin, a man adorned with flashy accessories stepped out from the shadow of the building, making a clattering noise.

The fabric of his clothing looked expensive, but it was clear he was not an ordinary person.

The man twisted his well-formed face and glared at Arvin.

<b>

"You're quite the spirited guy, huh? Don't you think this is a bit much for an innocent civilian? Aren't you supposed to be a knight candidate?"

<b>

The man pointed at the shining knight's badge on Arvin's collar and the short sword hanging at his waist.

<b>

"Absolutely. Attacking someone out of nowhere like that. It's terrifying, isn't it?"

<b>

Arvin replied nonchalantly, adding, "I just got a little scared and lashed out," while lightly flicking his wrinkled collar with his fingertips, showing no sign of remorse.

<b>

"Do you know what excessive defense is?"

"I know! But look, everyone is fine, right?"

"Just because they're lying on the ground doesn't mean they're fine!!"

<b>

The man showed no signs of fear or caution. He clicked his tongue loudly and glared at Arvin with annoyance, maintaining his nonchalant demeanor.

<b>

"You're quite the stickler for details, huh? They're alive and well, so what's the problem?"

"Tch! You crazy kid!"

<b>

Frowning, the man cautiously measured the distance between himself and Arvin.

He kept his hand close to the knife hidden at his waist.

<b>

Arvin could see clearly what the man was holding behind his back, but he faced him without losing his lighthearted tone.

<b>

"You, a wannabe knight, shouldn't be threatening innocent civilians with that fancy thing hanging at your waist."

"Huh? What are you talking about? I wouldn't pull this out against someone weaker than me."

"Hey, you bastard!!"

<b>

The man cursed Arvin, who had openly called him weak.

<b>

This was not good at all. He thought that if he provoked him a little, the man would quickly show a weakness, but the result was completely the opposite.

The more they talked, the more blood rushed to Arvin's head.

What a troublesome brat!

<b>

"T-this person... um, um, it's Rororingo!"

"What did you say?"

"Big sister, we have to give this person money!"

"......Hmm."

<b>

One of the twins, Dan, stretched out his finger and awkwardly announced the man's name.

The other twin, Nan, revealed that their sister was having a hard time because of this man.

<b>

The man, pointed at by the twins, glared at them, but they quickly hid behind Annie's small shadow.

<b>

"Brats, stay inside."

"But, but!"

"Isn't it your job to protect the two little ones?"

"......Okay."

<b>

Arvin moved to position himself between the children and the man, waving his lowered right hand to signal Annie to step back.

His left hand was tracing the strap of the sword belt.

Despite maintaining a light tone, the man was watching Arvin's movements with a wary gaze, unable to make a bold move.

<b>

"......So? Uh, Rororingo? You're the one shaking down girls for money, right?"

<b>

"Hah! Don't be stupid! I'm just trying to get back the money I lent! She insisted, so I kindly lent it to her! What kind of treatment is this for that person?! You better cover the medical expenses, got it?! Huh?!"

<b>

"I want to ask one thing, who borrowed that money?"

"What?! Of course, it's the manager here, right?!"

"Then it's none of my business. You guys are terrible! Did you suddenly attack an unrelated person?!"

"You bastard!!"

<b>

"Should we just go to the guard station right away?"

"No, wait, wait! It's not unrelated!"

"What do you mean?"

"You know those kids, right?"

"......And?"

"The original repayment deadline has passed. Their sister asked me to wait, so I kindly decided to give her some leeway!"

"......"

<b>

"The promise to wait is until tomorrow. We just came to confirm if we would make it in time."

"Hmm. So, if the person who borrowed the money can't pay it back, what happens?"

"Well, you! They'll have to leave this place. Poor things, they'll lose their home."

<b>

The man grinned, distorting his mouth in a nasty way.

<b>

"I'm not doing this as a charity. More than anything, it's only natural for a person to return what they borrowed, right?! Right?!"

"Sure, I get that. But why does their sister have to pay?"

"Of course! I'm giving her a break! It's only natural for her to pay the interest!"

"You haven't even received cash, though?"

"Shut up, you brat!! There are complicated circumstances that kids like you wouldn't understand!! Their sister is fine with it too!! She even signed a promissory note!!!"

"I see."

<b>

Arvin squinted at the piece of paper the man brandished and swayed his body slightly.

The man tensed up at that movement.

<b>

"I can clearly see that you're trying to deceive their sister."

"That's what I've been saying, isn't it?!"

"But that's dangerous."

"What do you mean?!"

"If you're waving around such fabricated material, it's like you're advertising that you're a fraud!"

"What?!"

"Huh? You seriously don't get it? No way?! People with low IQ are amazing!"

"What?! You little...!"

<b>

Veins bulged on the man's forehead, and his face quickly turned red.

<b>

"Oh, right, I almost forgot."

"What now?!"

"Speaking of which, I was told by my senior not to provoke those who don't know their place! Sorry about that!"

"!!!!!!!"

<b>

The man momentarily crouched down, ready to leap at Arvin, pulling out his knife from his waist.

At the same time, Arvin untied the strap of his sword belt and drew the short sword into his hand.

<b>

But at that moment, the men who had been lying on the ground began to groan and rise.

<b>

The man caught sight of this from the corner of his eye, released his grip on the knife, and lowered both hands to his sides, raising his voice.

<b>

"Get up, you worthless scum!! We're leaving!!"

<b>

As the man roughly announced to those he had brought along to leave, his gaze never left Arvin.

It looked as if he wanted to kill him right then and there.

<b>

"I'll remember your face, you brat."

"I'll remember too. The next time I see that face, I'll chop off your head immediately."

"Ugh! You little brat!!!"

<b>

The man understood that Arvin was serious.

That's why he couldn't step forward any further.

<b>

He had been throwing light banter, but his gaze and movements reminded him of the dangerous people he knew.

This kid was the same. He had the eyes of someone who had no hesitation in taking a life.

<b>

What the hell is a messed-up kid like this doing in a place like this?

No joke, this is someone I shouldn't get involved with!

<b>

The men glared at Arvin as they quietly left the scene.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Arvin watched them leave without letting his guard down and returned the short sword to its sheath on his sword belt.

<b>

"Arvin, are you okay?"

"Yeah, I'm fine now. Annie, you can go back. I'll have the guards come by to patrol this place."

"But, but... okay, I understand. I'll ask Father to send some guards."

"Yeah, that's good. You little ones! You stay inside the building and behave... Huh? Where's the manager?"

<b>

He noticed that the manager of the facility, who had not shown up during this commotion, was missing.

Normally, they would at least peek out. Especially since Dan and Nan had hurried inside. How could a manager not be curious about what was happening?

<b>

"He's not here right now."

"He hasn't been here since this morning."

"What the hell...?"

<b>

Arvin had never trusted the manager of this place, whom he occasionally saw. Their behavior always seemed suspicious.

From the earlier exchange with those men, it was clear that the manager was in debt.

<b>

<b>

It's possible that the management here is short on funds and in debt... but he doesn't seem like the type to be so virtuous.

He really seems suspicious.

<b>

Still, that guy ran away.

Is he surprisingly calm?

He didn't react much when I messed with his name, so that must be a fake name too.

But I thought he would lash out like the first guy if I provoked him that much... things don't always go as planned.

<b>

But this is troublesome. A relative of Karen Merlin...

If Suzy finds out I let him escape, she'll probably get furious. This is bad...

But I can't catch him anyway.

Ah, this is really bad. What should I do...?

<b>

<b>

Arvin pressed his temples, frowning as he imagined Suzy's angry face.
