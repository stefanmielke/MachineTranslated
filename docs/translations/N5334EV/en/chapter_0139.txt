# 127 Episode 127 Irving Haggard Probe.

Hey, you can come out now, okay?"

<blank>

He lets out a pained moan and four men are lying on the stone tatami mats.

Irving, who was looking down on them, called out to a figure in the shadows of the building.

<blank>

So far, Irving has yet to draw his sword.

When I first approached the man next to the entrance of the facility, he suddenly grabbed me by the chest and rolled me to the ground after I landed a light blow to the side of my arm.

The men who seemed to be his friends who were watching came out, one after the other, screaming, and a light blow that I put in the same way only made them all roll over.

<blank>

Now Irving has just called out to one who has not yet come out.

<blank>

As if in response to Irving, a man emerged from the shadows of the building, jingling his gaudy ornaments.

The fabrics of the clothes he wears look luxurious, but it is clear that he is not a stiff.

The man contorts his well-formed face and stares at Irving.

<blank>

You're a very bossy brother, aren't you? Don't you think this is a bit much for an innocent civilian? Aren't you a candidate for knighthood?

<blank>

The man said this while looking at the badge indicating the Order that glowed on Irving's lapel and the short sword at his waist.

<blank>

He said, "Not at all. "I mean, he just came out of nowhere and attacked me. It's scary, isn't it?"

<blank>

Irving responded to the man's words without seeming to take offense, lightly flicking his own wrinkled collar with his fingertips as he added, "I got a little freaked out.

<blank>

You know what overdefense is?

"I know, right? But, hey, we're all safe, right?"

When you're lying in the street, you ain't safe!

<blank>

He doesn't seem to be afraid of us at all, nor does he seem to be on the lookout for us. The man clicks his tongue and glares at Irving again, who does not change his lighthearted demeanor.

<blank>

"You're a detail-oriented guy, aren't you? You're alive and in one piece, so what's the problem?"

"Damn it! Crazy kid!"

<blank>

With a scowl on his face, the man jiggles and measures the distance between him and Irving.

He does not take his hand away from the knife tucked into his dorsal hip.

<blank>

Irving can see what his right hand behind his back is holding, but he confronts the man without losing his light tone.

<blank>

You, a would-be knight, shouldn't be threatening civilians with that big-ass thing hanging from your waist.

What? What are you talking about? I'm not going to pull out something like this against someone weaker than me.

"! You son of a bitch!

<blank>

The man is as venomous as can be with Irving, who comes in blatantly calling him weak.

<blank>

It's not looking good. I thought that if I gave him a bit of a nudge, he would show an opening right away, but the result was quite the opposite.

The more we talk, the more blood rises in my head.

What a hard guy to get into the habit of being a kid!

<blank>

"This guy here ......, er, er, Rorigo!"

What?"

'Sis, I have to give this man money!

"...... hmmm."

<blank>

One of the twins, Dan, extended his fingertips and told the man's name with a lisp.

Nan, also a twin, reveals that her sister is in a lot of trouble because of this man.

<blank>

The man who is pointed at glares at the twins, but the twins immediately hide behind Annie's little shadow.

<blank>

You little bastards, get inside.

But!"

It's your job to protect the two little guys, right?"

"...... got it."

<blank>

Irving moves to get between the children and the man and waves his lowered right hand, urging Annie to step back.

And his left hand was crawling with his fingertips on the sheath cord of his sword belt.

The man is unable to make any drastic moves when Irving, who is in the habit of keeping a light tone, follows his movements with a watchful eye.

<blank>

At ......?" Uh, Mr. Rollo Ringo? Anta, are you sure you're the one who's mugging girls?"

<blank>

"! Don't be ridiculous! I'm just trying to get you to pay back the money you loaned me. You asked for it, so I kindly lent it to you! How dare you treat me like this! He's not going to pay for my treatment, is he? What?

<blank>

I have one question: who owes you that money?"

"Ah? That's the manager of this place, of course!

I knew it was none of my business. You guys are terrible people, aren't you? You attacked an innocent person out of the blue!

Crap!

<blank>

"Shall we go quickly to the guard station?"

Wait, wait, wait, wait! I don't care what you think!

Where's what?"

"You know those kids, don't you?"

"......, so?"

The original due date had already passed. The kids' sister asked us to wait, so we warmly obliged, didn't we?

"......"

<blank>

You promised to wait until tomorrow. We just want to make sure we're going to make it. We're just here to make sure we're on time.

"Hmmm. And what happens if the borrower can't pay back the money?"

"That's you! You're going to have to get out of here. Poor kids, they'll have nowhere to live."

<blank>

Grinning, the man twisted his mouth disgustedly.

<blank>

I'm not doing this for charity either. What's more, it's natural for people to return what they borrowed, isn't it? Right?

I understand, but... So? Why do you care about their sister?"

<blank>

You know what? I'll explain it in a way that even a kid like you can understand! As I've been saying, if we lose this place, there will be no place for the kids to live, right? That's why my sister came crying to me! That's why I've been waiting for her to come and collect the money! Do you understand?

<blank>

'So, why is my sister paying for it?'

I'm waiting for you! I'm waiting for you! You're supposed to pay me the interest on it!

And you didn't even receive the cash?"

You're a fucking brat! There are complicated circumstances that kids don't understand! Their sister is fine with it, too! I even signed the deed like this!

I see.

<blank>

Irving squinted at the piece of paper the man took out and waved around, his eyes running over its surface. Then he shook his body with a yelp.

The man jerked and stiffened at the movement.

<blank>

I know you're trying to screw with their sister.

I told you I'm convinced!"

But that's a bad idea.

What?

If you're waving around made-up material like that, it's like advertising that you're a swindler! I'm a fraud!

What?

You don't think I know that? You don't understand? Seriously? You stupid people are awesome!"

What? This, this ......!"

<blank>

The man's forehead is covered with veins, and his face turns reddish as he looks at it.

<blank>

Oh, yes, yes, yes.

What now?

I remember a while ago, a senior told me not to stir up the wimps! Sorry!

"！！！！！"

<blank>

The man pulled out the knife at his waist and sank down for a moment to pounce on him.

At the same time, Irving also untied his sword belt and placed the entire sheath and short sword in his hand.

<blank>

But then the men who had fallen began to raise their bodies, moaning and groaning.

<blank>

Catching it out of the corner of his eye, the man removes his hand from the knife at his waist, drops his hands to his sides as he glares at Irving, and speaks up.

<blank>

Stand up tot..! You scum! I'm not pulling you out!"

<blank>

The man does not take his eyes off Irving as he wildly tells those he has brought with him that he is pulling out.

He looks at me as if he wants to kill me right now.

<blank>

I know your face! You little brat!

"I learned that one the hard way. The next time I see that face, I'm going to chop your head off."

Damn! Kuso brat!"

<blank>

The man understands that Irving is serious.

So I can't step forward any further.

<blank>

He kept talking lightly, but his eyes and his feet reminded me of the bad guys I knew.

It's the same with this guy. He has the eyes of a man who is not afraid to reap the rewards of life.

<blank>

What the hell is this crazy kid doing here?

I'm not kidding, he's the kind of guy you shouldn't get involved with!

<blank>

The men glared at Irving and quietly walked away from the scene.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Irving looked off guard as he returned the sheath of his shortsword to the sword belt at his waist.

<blank>

Irving, are you all right?"

Oh, don't worry about it. Annie can go back now. I'll tell the guards to patrol this place."

'So, but ......, yeah, okay. I'll ask your father to send someone to guard you."

'Oh, that's better. Little guys! You guys go inside the building and stay quiet ......, hmm? What's up with the janitor?"

<blank>

I noticed that there was no caretaker of the facility who had not been present for all this commotion.

Normally, they would have at least let you peek in their faces. And yet, Dan and Nan were in a hurry to get inside this facility. What kind of administrator wouldn't wonder what was going on?

<blank>

He's not here.

I haven't seen you since this morning.

What the hell is that? ......"

<blank>

Irving didn't trust the administrator of this place, whom he had seen from time to time before. His behavior was suspiciously suspicious.

I could see from the exchange I had with the guys earlier that the management of this place is in debt.

<blank>

<blank>

It may be possible that the company is short of money to run the place and has to borrow ......, but it doesn't seem like such an auspicious move to me.

It's a real stinker.

<blank>

But still, that guy got away with it.

Is he a surprisingly calm guy?

I played with the name and the response was not good, so that thing must be a fake name too.

But after all that agitation, I thought he'd try his hand like the first guy. ......, doesn't always work, does it?

<blank>

But I'm baffled. You're one of Karen Merlin's people. ......

Susie, I wonder if she'll get mad when she finds out we let her go. Oh man, .......

But, you know, there's no way to catch them.

Oh, it's really bad, what should I do? ......

<blank>

<blank>

Irving thought of Suzy's angry face and held his temples with a scowl.
