# Interlude 2 Let's go hunting!

This is a story about when I went hunting with everyone during the summer vacation after the new equipment was ready.


----------------

<blank>

The finished equipment was, in my opinion, quite cool and cute, and the tension was soaring.

<blank>

She wears an under vest type corset, gloves up to her elbows, long boots up to her knees, shoulder pads, and a cape over that.

And the skirt is a tight black leather mini!

Around her waist, she has a butt leather made of wolf fur wrapped around her waist and hanging down. This is that thing, it's like a JK with a jacket around her waist!

The corset is also short and has an inverted V-shaped opening at the lower front, so the navel is peeking out.

With the sigh-high socks extending from the long boots and the absolute area between the skirts, isn't it very dazzling? I wonder if it's not?

<blank>

Leather gloves and boots are made of layers of leather, and they serve as cuirasses and shin guards.

The corset, after all, made of layers of leather, is no longer a correction device, but rather a magnificent piece of protective gear.

By tightening the many belts attached, the size can be finely adjusted.

As a growing person, this is a nice feature!

The cami she wears under the corset is also cute, with lots of gathers around the bust! It looks as if it could fit two sizes larger.

Nothing! I'm not saying that the current contents are small!

<blank>

<blank>

When I was at home, wearing the equipment I had received, Bibi and Mia, who were at home with me at the time, asked me if I wanted to go hunting with them to show off my new equipment.　I was so happy to see them.

<blank>

I was already in a high mood, so I said yes with two words!

<blank>

Well, even so, we had to get permission and go through various procedures before we could go hunting in the woods with just the kids...but since Howard's dad took care of all the arrangements and procedures, we decided to go hunting two days later.

It was short notice, but all eight of the usual girls were in attendance.

<blank>

<blank>

Then, on the day of the hunt, we met in front of the I Tsumesho.

It's my first hunt and I'm showing off my equipment to everyone!

<blank>

I knew that. ......

To some extent, I had predicted this would happen.

As I thought, or as I expected, or as I thought, or as I expected, ...... was trumped up! By the sisters!

My eyeballs are rolling again!

That's right, I think it's the first time I've ever seen her bare legs in a mini-skirt!

Oh, Kara! Don't rub your inner thighs!

Jessica, don't be a dick!

Oh, is that Colin's? Is that Alicia's?

Uniiiinnn! Dana! No grabbing! Look! You're scaring the members of the group in the jammed house! Ah! Mia! You were watching at home! Why are you hugging me again? Meow! Don't put your hand in there ........! I'm not going to let you do that!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Tsk, I'm tired... I'm tired!

What's this about breathing being disrupted before you even go out hunting or what?

I'm currently slumped down on the bench in front of the Tsumesho! My eyes must be like leprosy eyes without any luster now!

But, as usual, it is what it always is!

But is it my imagination, or was today's event even more intense than usual?

Is it the mini? Is it the mini-skirts? !

At any rate, everyone seemed satisfied after stroking them all around, and they are calm now, but....

What is my position in life? Is it a lapdog?

<blank>

<blank>

I was sitting on a bench, taking a break, and looking around at everyone's outfits.

And this is the first time I've seen everyone's hunting gear.

<blank>

Kara is dressed in the same black ninja costume (?) that she wore the last time we met in hand-to-hand combat. The same black ninja costume (?) as when we met in the previous meeting.

But he still wears armored gloves and boots.

And a corset around the torso.

It's a corset, but it looks like an obi because of the Japanese-inspired costume!

<blank>

As expected, Alicia's limb equipment is heavily armored.

It looks like the limbs are made of a larger piece of metal.

There are vicious-looking metal spikes on the elbows and knees as well.

It would be painful to be hit with this.

<blank>

Dana is based on an ao dai, which is still a corset, shoulder pads, gloves, and boots.

<blank>

Yeah, I think, is this a basic set?

<blank>

The children in the rear guard also have the same corset, gloves, and boots.

I wondered if this was basic equipment, even though there are differences in size and shape. I asked...

<blank>

I heard that this series of corsets is all the rage right now!

So some people are equipped with breastplates and so on, and if you're a knightly man, it's a full plate set.

I'm talking about, like, bikini armor!

What a surprise! I wouldn't wear it, though!

<blank>

The rear guard all wear dress-like outfits to match.

It could be a tiered skirt with layers of ruffles or a bustle skirt with a long back.

Yeah, I knew the dress sense was 19th century!

Bibi, for example, wears a polar hat on his hair.

Colin's head also has a small silk hat on it.

Is it a dress armor?

<blank>

Still, what stands out most is Mia's outfit.

The undercorset is the same as mine, so the torso is constricted and the chest area is pressed out!

What an outrageous corruption!

Her white blouse is stretched out as if it were about to fall out of her corset!

I'll rub it all over you as much as I can later! I'm going to squeeze you as much as I want later!

That's it already, gniggnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnimnim! Gghh!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, in case you are wondering - none of the kids in the rear guard have a cane.

Instead, a "magic pearl" is adorned on the glove of the dominant hand, along with clay accessories.

This is the medium for activating the magic.

In other words, it's a cane substitute.

I heard that there are people who normally carry a wand, but this style of empty-handed magic use is the current trend!

<blank>

<blank>

But, I'm going hunting in the woods from now on, and I don't know if it's okay to wear a skirt like this or not. I think so, too...

Whatever it is, the fabric of this skirt is made of silver thread with mithril, and the lining is also finely embroidered with a magical seal!

It increases the rate of circulation of magic power within the equipment, thereby increasing its effectiveness in increasing magic power and aiding in the recovery of magic power.

For women in the rear guard positions, a skirt with ample pleats is an indispensable piece of equipment!

<blank>

But what about men? I ask....

Men are said to use robes, coats, capes and cloaks, which are similarly treated to increase the circulation of magic.

For women, he says, many choose the dress type for its practicality and appearance!

It's like girls are still girls!

<blank>

Well, and even though it is a dress type, it is not so long that it drags the hem on the ground.

Bibi and Mia in tiered skirts are also above the knee in length, and Colin and Jessica in bustle skirts show off their dazzling thighs.

<blank>

I thought I had seen a set of 19th century costumes and leather armors before, but that's it! It's the fashion of the "steampunk" world!

<blank>

In a world without internal combustion engines, let alone steam engines, "steampunk" is a funny thing to say!

<blank>

Steampunk" refers to an IF world where steam engines have developed instead of internal combustion engines, right?

So this world where there is no internal combustion engine and magical technology has developed is a "magic punk" world, right?

No. Is it 'etherpunk' because of the development of ether theory and technology?

<blank>

<blank>

So, dressed in our "etherpunk" gear, we entered the safe zone in the forest.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

The children's hunting is basically supposed to be done in the safe zone of the forest.

A safe zone does not mean that it is completely free from danger.

There are beasts that normally inhabit the forest, and relatively weak magical beasts spring up.

<blank>

In all likelihood, regular members of the group can hunt the magical beasts that spring up in such a shallow layer as if they were mowing the grass with one hand, and even children can handle them well.

So for the children, hunting in the safe zone is a well used opportunity to gain real-world experience.

<blank>

<blank>

Everyone's hunt is basically conducted in pairs, with the vanguard and the rear guard.

In this case, it is in the form of four pairs of people working together.

<blank>

The vanguard is Kara, Alicia and Dana.

The rear guard and magic defense are Jessica, Colin, and Bibi.

And then there's Mia, the magic offense.

<blank>

Kara and Jessica. Dana and Colin. Alicia and Bibi.

And I and Mia are each a pair.

<blank>

The three groups, except for us, formed a triangular formation, with the top of the formation at the head of the triangular formation, and searched the forest on three different sides, keeping a watchful eye.

Once the battle begins, the rear guard concentrates only on damage control for his partner, so even inexperienced children are less likely to lose a great deal of magical power.

<blank>

Mia and I are positioned in the center of the triangle.

Mia, a magic attacker, is positioned as a ranger, and she launches her magic according to the combat situation of the vanguard.

I'm like an escort.

<blank>

The search in the forest is where Kara, who is normally a scout, would be active first. ......

This party has Bibi's Algernon.

Algernon has the ability to share his senses with a wide range of small animals.

They can use this ability to detect things that exist around them like radar.

Bibi shares this sensation by channeling Algernon, who then passes this information on to everyone else.

The accuracy, even from my point of view, was quite impressive.

Kara's mouth was agape and she was boo-hooing in a boring way.

<blank>

The first such magical beast we came across was called "Sturgillat.

Looking like a cross between a bat and a flying squirrel, it glided in from the tree tops.

It is a bloodsucking species about the size of a cat, with almost no body hair and sharp claws and fangs.

Five of them attacked us, one after another.

The first to react was Kara.

As if to relieve the sorrow of not being able to play an active role in the search, he quickly threw something at the first one that came toward him.

Three blades were thrown at Sturgillat, and he shot them down.

It's the bitter nothings that threw me.

Well, I knew it. You are a ninja, aren't you?

<blank>

Dana was next on the hook for the kill.

The gains are long.

Holding the end of the spear in one hand, he took aim, stretched out, and pierced the stargillat.

The way they leapt up with their spears out of the air, they looked like little missiles!

<blank>

Furthermore, Alicia jumped up.

Kicking tree trunks one after another, they rose into the air like a triangle jump.

The stargill rat flies about 3-4 meters above the ground.

He kicked down his prey in the air from further above it.

I'm already a total aerial kill! Can't I just wear a black and yellow mask?

<blank>

The other two were dropped by Mia asari.

≪Branch Spire.

It is an attack magic that manipulates plants, in which several branches of trees grow up like spears and pierce the enemy.

Mia has earth and water attributes.

He says he specializes in magic that fuses the two and affects plants.

I like dealing with thorns the best," Mia says.

Mia's eyes narrowed as she said this.

Hey, what is it? Looking into those eyes, I felt a tingle run down my spine, you know?

<blank>

<blank>

After that, there was still the "Bone Spider," a low-grade undid that looked like a spider made of bones.

This guy was easily defeated by crushing the buttocks of the skull-like spider.

The movement was really like a spider, and it was really creepy!

<blank>

Another is "Soilcap," a hairless orangutan-like hexenbiest with an insect-like face and claws.

This was a bit of a formidable foe, and we all worked together to get around it.

Alicia tanked and took on the attack, and Dana and Kara took the damage and defeated her.

<blank>

In this way, they hunted down the magical beasts in the forest in a moderately smooth manner.

He said that with this number of people, a magical beast of this strength can be hunted in a stable manner.

<blank>

However, I feel that the strength of the magical beasts are all very blue, so I am not sure how strong or weak any of them are.

<blank>

To be honest, I borrowed two short swords from Howard Papa, but I haven't had a chance to use them, so I don't have them on hand. ......

Still, well! It's good that everyone is able to hunt with a safe margin!

<blank>

<blank>

But that guy came out of nowhere.

When the guy showed up, everyone's tension instantly tensed up.

We know that the opponent is stronger than the ones we have seen so far.

It is a large scorpion about two meters long.

I could recognize "Red Death Stalker" when I tagged it.

The name sounds kind of clingy and bad!

<blank>

Alicia was blown away before I could see it!

Apparently, it has more power than we thought.

He also played Dana's spear.

He is also attacking with Kara's movements. Is she also moving fast?

Mia's magic doesn't seem to be working at all.

Carla's face grew urgent, as if she were ready to go.

What's that? Is this the bad guy? I don't want to see Kara's face like that!

<blank>

The tail section of the giant scorpion, with its venomous stinger, closes in on Cara.

Oh, can't we lose this? That's not good!

He immediately jumped out and slashed up his right sword, slashing at its tail.

He then pulls out his left sword and slices the torso in half, head first.

<blank>

As soon as we slaughtered it, the other individuals around us gathered around it.

Are they sensing that their friends have been hit? Four more scorpions came into view.

<blank>

The faces of Karla and the others are tense.

I knew these guys were too much for Kara and her team. ......

I knew they were there from the beginning, but I had high hopes that the mobs that appeared around here would be no problem.

<blank>

This is a case for reflection.

It's all very blue, so it's hard to distinguish the strength... This is not the time to say that!

<blank>

We need to measure our opponents more carefully!

<blank>

We need to explore the magnitude of the signs, the strength of the magic contained within, and other details so that we can fully grasp the differences in strength.

I'm going to make many more mistakes like this after this!

<blank>

With this in mind, I quickly dealt with the remaining four.

<blank>

I did the processing, though!

<blank>

Just as I was about to cut down the last one...!

The sword is broken ahhhhhh!

<blank>

Geez! I borrowed this from Howard's dad! I borrowed it from Howard Papa, but I couldn't help it!

Both bottles are pocked oooh!

<blank>

I put too much "Ki" into it!

The sword itself could not withstand the pressure of the high density of Ki because it was caged far beyond its capacity!

<blank>

<blank>

 he shouted, flopped down on the spot, picked up the broken sword and started to cry egregiously.

<blank>

As I was auauing, Jessica came up to me.

<blank>

'Hey, are you all right Sue? Are you hurt? Does it hurt anywhere?"

"Oh, Jessica... my sword is broken..."

What? The sword? Um... where does it hurt?"

"It's not here... my sword... I borrowed it... ah..."

Oh...yeah, right? I'm not hurt ......."

"You're up against the Red Death Stalker, you're going to break your sword."

<blank>

Dana came to me and said.

<blank>

But it's my fault!

<blank>

Their exoskeletons are minerals.　I can't help it," Kara said, tapping the scorpion's shell with Dana.

I was muttering something about not being able to cut it normally....

<blank>

If everyone's okay, let's just go back to the campsite and report the Red Death Stalker's presence. I also have to report that the Red Death Stalker has appeared. ......"

<blank>

So Colin suggested, looking around at everyone.

Jessica agrees that yes, that would be nice.

Alicia, who was blown away, has already recovered from the damage and is on her feet.

So we went back to the station and reported the killing of the giant scorpion.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

After reporting back to the Tsumesho, there was a bit of a commotion.

The people in the group who identified the remains of the scorpion asked for more information, and people from the village hall were also brought in to retrieve it.

After a while, Howard Papa came too.

<blank>

Ha, Mr. Howard, I'm sorry."

"What's the matter, Susie? What are you apologizing for?"

I'm sorry I broke the sword I borrowed from you.

Suzy, you don't have to apologize. You did what you had to do."

But, but it's my fault..."

I must apologize to you, Suzy.... I gave you a sword that didn't match your strength. I'm sorry you couldn't wield it to your full potential.

I'm not sorry, Mr. Howard! Howard, you should not be apologizing! It was my fault!

No, this is my fault for not giving Suzy the sword she deserved. This is not something for Suzy to worry about.

<blank>

We were arguing like that, and someone came to help us out! I was repeating, "I'll take care of it!

<blank>

Why don't you take this opportunity to forge a sword worthy of Suzy?"

<blank>

He was the mayor of the village of August Dulles.

Augusto came to the stuffing station to check on us, along with an Amcam House employee who had come to collect the scorpions.

<blank>

The exoskeleton of the Red Death Stalker can be used to make a strong enough sword if it is refined. How about using it to make a new sword for Suzy and have Howard give it to her as a gift?

Mm-hmm! That's good! That's a great idea! Quintessential! That's August!

<blank>

Mr. Howard tapped Mr. August's shoulder repeatedly with a bang, his face tearing up with joy and laughter.

<blank>

Oh, Mr. August's big body is shaking so much every time Mr. Howard hits it, isn't it?

Is it my imagination or is my smile a little twitchy?

<blank>

My sword?

Yes," she said! Suzy! Your sword! Let's make it a sword that matches your equipment! What do you think?"

Why would you do that for me?

Don't be shy, okay? It's good for the village that Suzy has a strong weapon. I want to send you one. Will you take it?

Oh... yes, yes! Thank you very much! I'm so happy...!"

<blank>

Mr. Howard, I see! Mm! Mm-hmm!　He nodded his head again and again and again, as if he was happy.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Your head?

You say, "My eyes are down at ......?"

This loosened up face... seriously?"

<blank>

The members of the group took a step or two back, looking at me as if they couldn't believe what they were seeing.

<blank>

"Is this... the Mr. Cloud in his parent-jerk mode we've heard so much about? Oh no!"

<blank>

Kara muttered something strange.

<blank>

But I see it all the time at Sue's house, so it's not that unusual, you know? Right? Bibi?

Shush." Mia! You're talking too loud!"

<blank>

What? What? What do you mean, Bear Boy?

<blank>

What's with the strange atmosphere? Huh?

<blank>

But...well, good. No one is hurt today.

Mr. Howard looks very happy! I'm happy as long as it makes him happy!

<blank>

It was a fun day, despite everything.

I was able to hunt with everyone with my first equipment and even promised to have a new sword struck at the end!

<blank>

When the sword is ready and I show it to you wearing it with this set of equipment, do you think Howard Papa will be pleased?

Duh! I bet they'd be happy to hear that!

I'm really looking forward to it!



<blank>

----------------

In the next issue, we will talk about the end of a chapter.

Interlude 3: Let's Go to the Harvest Festival!

<blank>

It will be dropped next week on the 31st at 20:00.
