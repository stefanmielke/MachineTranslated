# Interlude 2 Let's Go Hunting!

This is a story about when I went hunting with everyone during summer vacation after my new equipment was completed.

----------------

<b>

The completed equipment was, in my opinion, quite stylish and cute, and it was something that really boosted my spirits.

<b>

A corset in a vest style, gloves that reach up to the elbows, long boots that go up to the knees, shoulder guards, and a cape draped over it all.

And the skirt is a tight mini made of black leather!

Around my waist, I have a wolf fur butt flap hanging down. This is like how high school girls wrap their jackets around their waists!

The corset is short, with the front lower part opening in an inverted V shape, so my belly button is peeking out.

With the thigh-high socks extending from the long boots and the absolute territory between the skirt, it must be very dazzling, don’t you think? Don’t you think?!!

<b>

The leather gloves and boots are layered with multiple layers of leather, serving as both gauntlets and shin guards.

Indeed, the corset, layered with leather, is no longer just a shaping garment but a proper piece of armor.

By tightening the many belts, fine size adjustments are also possible.

As someone in their growth spurt, this is a delightful feature!

The camisole worn under the corset has plenty of gathers at the chest, making it cute! It looks like it could fit even if it were about two sizes larger.

I-I’m not saying my current size is small or anything!!

<b>

<b>

While I was at home wearing the delivered equipment and getting excited, Bibi and Mia, who were with me at the time, suggested that since we had new equipment, why not go hunting together?

<b>

I was already in a great mood, so I readily agreed!

<b>

Well, that said, there are various permissions and procedures needed for the kids to go hunting in the forest… but since Howard Papa took care of all those arrangements, it was decided that we would go hunting two days later.

Despite the suddenness, all eight of the usual girls are participating.

<b>

<b>

And on the day of the hunt, we met in front of the first outpost.

It was my first hunt, and I was going to show off my equipment to everyone!

<b>

Well, I knew this would happen to some extent...

I had predicted that it would turn out this way, yes.

As expected, or rather, as predicted, or rather, it was just as I thought... I was thoroughly teased by the older girls!!

My eyes were spinning around again!

I mean, I think it’s the first time I’ve shown my bare legs in a mini skirt!

Karla! D-Don’t touch my inner thigh!

J-Jessica, don’t sniff me!

W-What is this pressing against me? Is it Colin’s?! Or Alicia’s?

Ugh! D-Dana! No grabbing! Look! The members at the outpost are surprised!! Ah! Mia! You were watching at home! Why are you hugging me again... Ugh! Nyaaa! There... your hand is going in...! Nnnyahhh!!!

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

I’m tired... I’m really tired!

What is this? My breathing is already ragged before going hunting?!

Right now, I’m slumped on the bench in front of the outpost, and I’m sure my eyes look like those of a zombie with no sparkle!!

But, well, it’s the usual thing!

However, today felt particularly intense, or is it just my imagination?

Is it because of the mini skirt?! 

Anyway, everyone seems satisfied after having their fill of touching, and now they’re calm...

What on earth is my position?! Is it really some sort of plaything?!!

<b>

<b>

So, while sitting on the bench and catching my breath, I looked around at everyone’s outfits again.

This is my first time seeing everyone’s hunting gear.

<b>

Karla’s outfit is the same black ninja outfit (?). 

However, she is wearing armored gloves and boots.

And she also has a corset around her waist.

It’s a corset, but since it has a Japanese-style outfit, it looks like an obi!

<b>

Alicia, as expected, has bulky armor on her arms and legs.

It seems her arms and legs are fitted with larger metal armor.

There are vicious-looking metal spikes on her elbows and knees.

That would hurt if hit.

<b>

Dana is based on an ao dai, and she also has a corset, shoulder guards, gloves, and boots.

<b>

Hmm, I wonder if this is the basic set?

<b>

The backline girls also have corsets, gloves, and boots that are the same.

Although there are differences in size and shape, I wonder if this is the basic equipment? When I asked...

<b>

I heard that this corset series is currently in fashion!!

So, there are people wearing chest plates and those in knight-style full plate sets.

I even heard there are bikini armors!!

What a thing! I-I won’t wear that!!

<b>

The backline girls are all wearing dress-like outfits.

They have tiered skirts with frills layered on top of each other, or bustle skirts that are longer in the back.

Yeah, it really feels like 19th-century dress sense!

Bibi has her hair styled up with a polar hat on top.

Colin has a small silk hat on his head.

Is this what they call dress armor?

<b>

But the one that stands out the most is Mia’s outfit.

Since she has the same under corset as me, her waist is cinched, and her chest is more pronounced!

What a scandalous display of flesh!

Her white blouse is stretched to the limit, and it looks like it’s about to spill out from the corset, bouncing around!

You’ll pay for this! I’ll squeeze and knead you later!

Just you wait, I’ll be all over you!! Guh!

<b>

<b>

By the way, the backline girls are all not carrying staffs.

Instead, their dominant hand gloves are adorned with “magic beads” along with clay accessories.

These serve as a medium for activating magic.

In other words, they act as substitutes for staffs.

I’ve heard that some people do carry staffs, but this hands-free style of casting magic is currently in fashion!

<b>

<b>

But I wonder if it’s okay to go hunting in a skirt like this in the forest...?

Apparently, the fabric of this skirt uses silver threads made from mithril, and the lining is intricately embroidered with magic seals!

Because of this, it increases the circulation rate of magic within the equipment, enhancing magical power and aiding in magic recovery.

So for the women in backline roles, this skirt with plenty of pleats is essential equipment!

<b>

But what about the men? When I asked...

It seems men wear robes, coats, capes, or cloaks, similarly treated to enhance magic circulation.

For women, it seems many choose dress types for practicality and appearance!

Girls really are girls, aren’t they?

<b>

Well, even though they say dress types, they’re not so long that they drag on the ground.

Bibi and Mia’s tiered skirts are knee-length, and Colin and Jessica’s bustle skirts reveal their dazzling thighs.

<b>

This is it! I felt like I had seen a set of leather armor with costumes from the 19th century somewhere, but yes! It’s the fashion of a “steampunk” world!

<b>

It’s a funny story that there’s no internal combustion engine or even steam engines in this world, but still “steampunk”!

<b>

“Steampunk” refers to a world where steam engines developed instead of internal combustion engines, right?

So, in this world where there are no internal combustion engines and magic technology has developed, can we call it “magic punk”?

No, since ether theory and technology have developed, is it “ether punk”?

<b>

<b>

So, we, clad in such “ether punk” equipment, entered the safe zone in the forest.

<b>

<b>

<b>

The children’s hunting is basically done in the safe zones of the forest.

Even though it’s called a safe zone, it doesn’t mean there are no dangers at all.

There are ordinary beasts living in the forest, and relatively weak magical beasts can spawn.

<b>

However, magical beasts that spawn in such shallow layers can be hunted easily by regular members as if they were just trimming grass, and the children can handle them just fine.

Thus, for the children, hunting in the safe zone serves as a valuable opportunity to gain practical experience.

<b>

<b>

Everyone’s hunting is basically done in pairs of frontliners and backliners.

In this case, we are acting in four pairs.

<b>

The frontliners are Karla, Alicia, and Dana.

The backliners, with magical defense, are Jessica, Colin, and Bibi.

And Mia is the magical offense.

<b>

Karla and Jessica. Dana and Colin. Alicia and Bibi.

And I am paired with Mia.

<b>

The other three pairs are taking triangular formations, with the apex at the front, exploring the forest while keeping watch in three directions.

Once combat begins, the backliners focus solely on damage control for their partner, allowing even inexperienced children to avoid significant magical power loss.

<b>

Mia and I are positioned at the center of that triangle.

As a magical attacker, Mia takes a skirmisher role, casting spells according to the frontliners’ combat situation.

I’m in a protective role, like a bodyguard.

<b>

In the forest, the scout role is usually where Karla shines...

But in this party, there’s Bibi’s Algernon.

Algernon has the ability to share senses with a wide range of small animals.

Using this ability, it can detect things around like a radar.

Bibi channels with Algernon to share those senses and conveys that information to everyone.

The accuracy of this was quite impressive from my perspective.

Karla was pouting and grumbling in boredom.

<b>

In the midst of that, the first magical beast we encountered was called a “Star Rat.”

It had a bat and flying squirrel-like appearance and glided down from the trees.

About the size of a cat, it had almost no body hair and possessed sharp claws and fangs, being a bloodsucking species.

Five of them attacked one after another.

The first to react was Karla.

To relieve her frustration from not being able to scout, she quickly threw something at the first one coming toward her.

Three thrown blades struck the Star Rat and shot it down.

What she threw were shurikens.

Well, I knew that. She’s a ninja after all!

<b>

Next to take it down was Dana.

Her weapon is long.

Holding the spear with one hand, she aimed and lunged to impale the Star Rat.

The way she jumped up with her spear was like a small missile!

<b>

Then Alicia jumped up.

Kicking off the tree trunks, she ascended into the air like a triangular jump.

The Star Rats were flying about 3 to 4 meters above the ground.

From even higher up, she kicked down the prey in the air.

It was completely an aerial combat style! Shouldn’t she be wearing a black and yellow mask?

<b>

Mia easily took down the remaining two.

≪Branch Spear≫

Branches from the trees extend like spears, controlling plants to pierce the enemy.

Mia has earth and water attributes.

She excels in magic that influences plants by fusing these two.

She says she loves handling thorns the most.

As she said this, Mia’s eyes narrowed.

W-What’s that? Looking at those eyes sent a shiver down my spine?!

<b>

<b>

After that, we encountered a low-level undead called “Bone Spider.”

It was easily defeated by smashing its skull-like rear end.

Its movements were really spider-like and super creepy!

<b>

There was also a magical beast called “Soil Cap,” which had an insect-like face and claws, resembling a hairless orangutan.

This one seemed to be a bit of a tough opponent, and we coordinated to take it down.

Alicia took on the role of tank, absorbing attacks, while Dana and Karla dealt damage to defeat it.

<b>

In this way, we were able to hunt magical beasts in the forest quite smoothly.

With this number of people, it seems we can reliably hunt beasts of this strength.

<b>

However, I personally feel that all the magical beasts are equally terrifying, so I can’t really tell which ones are strong or weak.

<b>

To be honest, I borrowed two short swords from Howard Papa, but I haven’t had the chance to use them, so I’m feeling a bit idle...

Even so, well! It’s good that everyone is hunting safely!

<b>

<b>

But then it suddenly came.

When it appeared, everyone’s tension instantly heightened.

I could tell it was a somewhat stronger opponent than the ones we had faced so far.

It was a giant scorpion about two meters long.

When targeted, it was recognized as a “Red Death Stalker.”

What a bothersome and unpleasant name!

<b>

In the blink of an eye, Alicia was blown away!

It seems it has more power than we expected.

Dana’s spear was deflected.

It was also attacking in sync with Karla’s movements. Is it fast too?

Mia’s magic didn’t seem to have much effect either.

Karla’s expression turned serious, as if she had made up her mind.

Uh-oh? Is this a dangerous one? I don’t want to see Karla’s face like that!!

<b>

The giant scorpion’s tail, equipped with a poisonous stinger, approached Karla.

Ah, can’t she dodge this? This is bad!!

I immediately jumped out, slashing upward with my right sword to cut off its tail.

Then I drew my left sword and sliced its body in half from head to tail.

<b>

As I defeated it, the other individuals nearby gathered around.

Did they sense that their companion was defeated? Four more scorpions came into view.

<b>

Karla and the others’ faces stiffened.

As I thought, these guys might be too much for Karla and the others...

I had known they were here from the beginning, but I thought they wouldn’t be a problem since they were mobs that appeared around here.

<b>

This is a matter for reflection.

I can’t distinguish their strengths because everything looks equally terrifying... I can’t afford to think like that!

<b>

I need to be more careful in measuring the opponent’s strength!

I need to be able to grasp the differences in strength by examining the size of their presence, the strength of the magic they contain, and more.

If I don’t, I’ll keep making mistakes like this!

<b>

Thinking this, I quickly dealt with the remaining four.

<b>

I managed to take them down, but!!!

<b>

Just as I slashed the last one...!

The sword broke!!!

<b>

Ugh! I borrowed this from Howard Papa!! I finally borrowed it, and now it’s broken!!!

Both of them snapped in half!!!

<b>

I put too much “ki” into it!

I ended up exceeding its capacity significantly, and the sword itself couldn’t withstand the high-density pressure of “ki”!

<b>

Ughhh! I screamed and sat down on the spot, picking up the broken sword and starting to cry.

<b>

As I was wailing, Jessica came over.

<b>

“Are you okay, Su? Did you get hurt? Is there anywhere that hurts?”

“Ah, Jessica... my sword... it broke...”

“Eh? The sword? Um... is there anywhere that hurts?”

“None... it’s just that the sword... I borrowed it...”

“Ah... I see, so you’re not hurt...”

“It was against a Red Death Stalker, so the sword would break.”

<b>

Dana chimed in.

<b>

“But it’s my fault...!”

<b>

Their exoskeletons are made of minerals, so it can’t be helped. Karla said, tapping the scorpion’s shell along with Dana.

They were also muttering that it normally wouldn’t be cut...

<b>

“Um... for now, if everyone is okay, let’s head back to the outpost? We need to report that a Red Death Stalker appeared...”

<b>

Colin suggested while looking around at everyone.

Jessica agreed, saying, “Yes, that sounds good.”

Alicia, who had been blown away, was already standing up, having recovered from the damage.

So, we headed back to the outpost to report the defeat of the giant scorpion.

<b>

<b>

<b>

After finishing the report at the outpost, it caused a bit of a commotion.

The members who confirmed the scorpion’s remains sought detailed information, and people from the village office were gathered to retrieve it.

After a while, Howard Papa also arrived.

<b>

“Howard, I’m sorry.”

“What happened, Suzy? Why are you apologizing?”

“I broke the sword I borrowed... I’m so sorry.”

“Suzy, there’s no need to apologize. You just did what you had to do.”

“But, but it’s because of me...”

“The one who should apologize is me, Suzy... I gave you a sword that didn’t match your strength. You couldn’t exert your full power, I’m sorry.”

“N-No, that’s not something you should apologize for, Howard! It was my carelessness...!”

“No, it was my fault for not giving you a sword that suited you. You don’t need to worry about it, Suzy.”

<b>

As the two of them continued to go back and forth in a water-throwing argument, someone stepped in to help.

<b>

“How about taking this opportunity to forge a sword suitable for Suzy?”

<b>

It was Mayor August Dales.

Mr. August came to check on the situation at the outpost along with the staff from Amukam House who came to retrieve the scorpion.

<b>

“The exoskeleton of this ‘Red Death Stalker’ can be refined into a strong sword material. How about using this to forge a new sword for Suzy, as a gift from Howard?”

“Hmm! That’s good! That’s a wonderful idea! As expected! Well done, August!!”

<b>

Howard was repeatedly patting August on the shoulder, looking delighted and laughing.

<b>

Ah, Mr. August’s large body shook significantly every time Howard patted him.

Is it just my imagination, or is his smile a bit strained?

<b>

“My sword...?”

“Yes! Suzy! It’s your sword! Let’s make it a sword that matches your equipment! What do you think?”

“Really, for me?”

“Don’t hold back! Having a strong weapon is also for the village’s benefit. More than anything, I want to give it to you. Will you accept it?”

“Ah... yes, yes! Thank you very much! I’m so happy!”

<b>

Howard was nodding repeatedly, looking very pleased.

<b>

<b>

<b>

“W-What’s this?”

“Is his eyelids drooping...?”

“This relaxed face... is this real?”

<b>

It seems the members were taking a step back, looking at him as if they couldn’t believe their eyes.

<b>

“Is this... the parent mode of Cloud that I heard about? This is crazy!”

<b>

Karla muttered something strange.

<b>

“But you can see that at Su-chan’s house all the time, so it’s not that rare, right? Right? Bibi-chan?”

“Shh! Mia! Keep your voice down!”

<b>

Huh? What? What does that mean, Bear-chan?

<b>

There’s a strange atmosphere, isn’t there? Huh?

<b>

But... well, it’s fine. No one got hurt today.

Howard looks really happy! As long as Howard Papa is happy, that’s what matters to me!

<b>

There were various things, but it was a fun day.

I was able to hunt with everyone in my first equipment, and in the end, I even made a promise to have a new sword forged!!

<b>

When the sword is ready, I wonder if Howard Papa will be happy when I show it to him along with this equipment?

Yeah! I’m sure he’ll be delighted!!

I’m really looking forward to it!

Next time, it will be a story after the first chapter ends.

“Interlude 3 Let’s Go to the Harvest Festival!”

I will post it on the 31st at 8 PM next week.
