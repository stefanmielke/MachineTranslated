# Chapter 212: The Pursuer

Swallowed by light, the place that appeared once again was somewhere in the mountains.

In front of the woman stood a towering white rock wall.

From the texture of the rock and the state of the surrounding trees, it was clear that this place was distinctly different from the land she had just been in.

<b>

"……As I thought."

<b>

The woman, having looked around, deepened the smile on her lips as if she had come to a realization.

She raised the still glowing Holy Grail towards the wall-like rock face before her, and a line of light ran sharply across the surface as if it were splitting.

A single beam of light quickly widened and spread out broadly to the sides.

It was as if a gigantic double door was slowly opening, the light expanding grandly to the left and right.

<b>

Before she knew it, the wall had been adorned with decorations resembling majestic gateposts.

It looked like the solemn and austere gate of a temple.

The rock face on either side had also been unexpectedly designed like doors.

Now, that splendid door was slowly opening before the woman.

<b>

"Clariemond! You are connected to my shadow, aren't you?"

<b>

The woman, having witnessed the hidden gate open, called out towards somewhere.

In response, her shadow expanded greatly.

<b>

"Has it opened? Lual Na Lubre."

<b>

From within that shadow, a woman clad in a garnet dress, redder than blood, emerged.

Her porcelain skin and elongated, sky-blue eyes were cold, and her thick lips were as red as blood.

Her platinum blonde hair, beautifully parted in the middle, flowed down to her chest and seemed to gain more radiance as it extended.

The woman in the red dress, who had emerged from the shadow, glided silently to stand beside the woman in the blue dress.

<b>

"I have fulfilled my promise. Take the Holy Grail, Clariemond. The rest is your job."

<b>

"Thank you, Lual Na Lubre."

<b>

"Make sure to remember your debt, Clariemond."

<b>

With a terribly calm gaze, Lual offered Clariemond the Holy Grail, filled to the brim with blood.

Clariemond received the offered Holy Grail with reverence.

<b>

"The proof to reach the Abyss is five and three. Obtain forgiveness and lamentation, create the wind, unite the earth, and gain the golden key at the end of the rainbow. Only those who possess the golden key may open the door." Words said to have been left by the gods of antiquity... It seems the five stones are being collected smoothly, Clariemond."

<b>

"Thanks to you, Lual Na Lubre. I already know where they are."

<b>

"That's good to hear, Clariemond. Congratulations. With this, one of the keys to the golden key can finally be obtained."

<b>

Without responding to Lual's words, Clariemond disappeared into the light gate, holding the Holy Grail.

Lual quietly watched her leave with a gaze devoid of warmth.

<b>

As Clariemond vanished into the gate, the light gate also dissipated, returning to the original rock face.

Around Lual Na Lubre, a gentle wind began to swirl.

<b>

As if weightless, Lual's body floated up with the wind.

Once she rose to a height where she could look down at the towering rock wall before her, she began to slowly turn her body, surveying the surroundings.

<b>

"Indeed, there was no mistake in this mountain. I wonder if it’s just behind the entrance to the mine on the other side? Hehe, I must commend that child for pinpointing this place just from the literature."

<b>

Chuckling softly, Lual twirled in the air.

<b>

With her left hand, she danced her fingers as if to caress the sky.

Then, a fist-sized red mass appeared in her hand.

It pulsed slightly, dripping red droplets.

Before long, Lual's left hand became soaked in red.

<b>

"Ahhh... it really has a wonderful scent..."

<b>

Lual pressed her nose against the pulsing red mass and took a deep, large breath.

<b>

"Having obtained something like this, I wonder if it was worth lending a hand?"

<b>

The red mass in her hand occasionally contracted and expanded.

Each time, red liquid overflowed from Lual's hand.

Bringing her mouth close to it, Lual slowly licked it, intertwining her long tongue with the red mass to savor it directly.

<b>

"Ahhh... the taste of a delightful young heart... Hehe, hehehe."

<b>

<b>

At that moment, a rumble echoed from the depths of the earth.

The mountain trembled, and the trees began to sway violently.

A part of the rock face where she had just been showed slight signs of collapse, and several rocks fell far below.

<b>

"It seems the crystal has been obtained without incident. It feels as if the fire temple is lamenting."

<b>

Suspended in the air, Lual lovingly kissed the red mass in her hand and murmured as she looked down at the earth.

<b>

"With this, it’s the second one along with the water that Hazard obtained three years ago. During the water incident, the lamentation called forth a storm... What about fire? Will the mountains spew forth flames? Hehehe."

<b>

Lual gently pressed her lips against the object in her hand, sinking her fangs into it as if biting into a juicy fruit.

Instantly, red liquid gushed out.

As it stained her mouth red, she eagerly sucked it up.

<b>

"This is the best... Such a flavorful item is hard to come by."

<b>

Lual's eyes glistened, her cheeks flushed, and she began to show an expression of ecstasy.

Her hands and mouth were smeared with red blood, and her eyes glowed with a golden, alluring light.

There stood the horrifying figure of a vampire reveling in bliss.

<b>

"While gazing at the goddess's lament, I'll savor you slowly, Karen? Hehe! Hehehehehe."

<b>

Her wicked laughter echoed through the mountains, as Lual Na Lubre danced in the air.

Holding aloft the young girl's heart, dripping with fresh blood, she twirled and swayed with a lascivious smile.

The sound of her laughter reverberated off the rock face, sinister and horrifying.

It possessed a resonance that chilled the hearts of those who heard it, dissolving into the trees.

<b>

Lual Na Lubre held the young heart high, savoring the sweet bliss of ecstasy.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Suddenly, a pillar of light extended from the ground.

In an instant, it enveloped Lual's left wrist and pierced through it.

A thunderous sound split the air, shaking the surroundings.

<b>

"?!!"

<b>

In an instant, Lual's left hand and everything beyond it vanished.

Including the young heart she had been holding.

<b>

"W-what is happening!!! You! Who is it... who is it?!"

<b>

The disappearance of the heart she had been holding just moments ago transformed Lual's expression into one of fury.

<b>

"You still have that grotesque taste."

<b>

"You?!"

<b>

Startled by a voice from directly behind her, Lual widened her eyes and turned around.

Upon confirming the presence of someone else hovering in the air like herself, Lual's hair stood on end, and her eyes gleamed like embers.

<b>

"'The Servant of the Tower of Dust', 'The Flame that Runs the Earth', 'The Brilliant Alchemist', 'The One Who Recites in the Moonlit Forest'... and the dreadful 'Heart Eater'! Lual Na Lubre, it's been a while."

<b>

"You! Alma Malma!!!"

<b>

Lual's eyes bulged like a demon's, glaring at her opponent with intense hatred.

Her left hand, which should have been blown away, had already returned to its original state.

However, what had been in that hand was still lost.

<b>

To confirm this anew, she clenched her left hand tightly, furrowing her brow deeply.

<b>

"Indeed! ...How many hundreds of years has it been since I last saw you?!"

<b>

Her words were calm, but the intense hatred in her eyes could not be concealed.

A fierce tone seeped through the rhythm of her speech.

<b>

"It has been about 150 years since you taught that child about the seal."

<b>

"Oh? He seems to be pleased. I have no recollection of being glared at with such resentful eyes. By the way, you found this place quite well, Alma Malma?"

<b>

Winds swirled between the two women.

The density of magical power distorted the atmosphere significantly.

<b>

Lual's hair swayed wildly.

The magical power, swollen to the point of being uncontrollable, sparked with pops and crackles at its edges.

Around the two, the concentration of magical power rose to the point where it directly affected the material world.

<b>

"That anklet. No matter how cleverly hidden, I quickly noticed the remnants of your filthy magical power. If you're involved, it’s only natural to investigate the surroundings, isn’t it?"

<b>

Alma chuckled softly, shrugging her shoulders as if to say it was obvious.

<b>

"You are quite something yourself, Alma Malma! Pretending to be a guardian while treating that girl as bait!"

<b>

"Which mouth is saying that, Lual Na Lubre? Or do you feel uneasy unless you utter a sarcastic remark?"

<b>

"Such arrogance!"

<b>

With the force to crush the person before her, Lual's magical power swelled dramatically.

For an ordinary person, the pressure of that magical power would be enough to crush them.

<b>

But Alma's magical power easily pushed it back.

Her lips curled in a smirk, as if to say, 'Did I do something?'

<b>

"You need not worry; today I will thoroughly annihilate you, Lual Na Lubre."

<b>

"Go ahead and try, Alma Malma! You detestable high elf!!"

<b>

The two intensifying magical powers clashed, swirling around each other.

The atmosphere screamed, and a storm-like wind raged around them.
