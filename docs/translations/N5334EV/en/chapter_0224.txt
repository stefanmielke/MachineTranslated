# 212 Episode 212 The Tracker

Swallowed by the light, it reappeared somewhere in the mountains.

A white rock wall rises before the woman's eyes.

The quality of the rock surface and the surrounding trees clearly indicate that this is a different place from the land we had just been in.

<blank>

"............ after all."

<blank>

The woman looked around, and the smile on her face deepened, as if she had just gotten the point.

When the chalice, which still emits light, is held up to the rock face that rises like a wall in front of us, a line of light breaks through the wall surface.

A single streak of light becomes wider and wider as you look at it, and then spreads wide and sideways.

As if a huge double-opening door was opening, the light slowly and widely extends to the left and right.

<blank>

I noticed that its walls were unknowingly carved with decorations that looked like majestic gateposts.

It looks like a solemn and solemn temple gate.

The rock face, which opens to the left and right, has also been designed to look like a doorway at some point.

Now, slowly, its magnificent doors opened before the woman.

<blank>

'Clarimonde!　You are connected to my shadow, aren't you?"

<blank>

The woman, seeing that the hidden gate had been opened, raised her voice toward somewhere.

Then, as if in answer, the woman's shadow spreads wide.

<blank>

Did you open it?　Rual na lubre."

<blank>

Oozing out of the shadows, a woman wearing a garnet dress redder than blood appeared.

His white porcelain skin, long slits, sky-blue eyes are cold, and his thick lips are as red as blood.

The platinum blonde hair, neatly parted in the middle and flowing down to the chest on either side, becomes more luminous the further it goes.

The woman in the red dress emerged from the shadows and glided soundlessly to stand beside the woman in the blue dress.

<blank>

I have fulfilled my promise. Take the chalice, Clarimonde. The rest is your business.

<blank>

Thank you, luar na lubre."

<blank>

Let us be indebted to you at all costs, Clarimonde."

<blank>

With a look of extreme quietness in his eyes, Rual offered Clarimonde a chalice filled to the brim with blood.

Clarimonde reverently accepts the chalice offered to her.

<blank>

"'The proofs that lead to the chasm are five and three. With forgiveness and lamentation, create the winds and join the earth to obtain the golden key at the end of the rainbow. Only he who has the golden key will open the door." These words are said to have been left by the gods in prehistoric times. ...... The five stones seem to be coming together nicely, Clarimonde."

<blank>

Thanks to you, Lual na Lubre. I know where to find you.

<blank>

That's great news, Clarimonde. Congratulations. Now you finally have the one thing that will lead you to the Golden Key.

<blank>

Without responding to Rual's words, Clarimonde, chalice in hand, disappeared into the gate of light.

Rual quietly looks away with a temperatureless gaze.

<blank>

As soon as Clarimonde disappeared into the gate, the light gate was scratched away and returned to its original rock face.

The wind begins to quietly curl around Lual na Lubre as he looks away from it.

<blank>

With the wind, Ruar's body floats as if it has no weight.

From there, he climbed to a height where he could look down at the rock wall that rose before him, and his body slowly began to turn in place as he continued to look around.

<blank>

I knew it was the right mountain. It is just behind the entrance to the mine on that side, right?　I have to give him credit for identifying this place from the literature alone.

<blank>

Lual spins around as if dancing in the air, giggling.

<blank>

As it was, with his left hand, he danced his fingers as if he were caressing the sky.

Then a fist-sized red mass appeared in his hand.

It pulsated with a small, jittery pulse and dripped with red drops.

As I look at Ruar's left hand, it becomes red, wet, and wrinkled.

<blank>

"Oh ......, it still smells so good ......"

<blank>

Rual put the tip of his nose against the pulsating red mass and took a deep, deep breath.

<blank>

I hope it was worth it, because I got all this stuff."

<blank>

The red mass in my hand was twitching and contracting from time to time.

Each time he does, the red liquid comes flooding into Rual's hands.

She then licks up the red mass with her long tongue, as if she were tasting it directly.

<blank>

"Ahhhh ......, the taste of a nice young heart ....... Ugh, ugh, ugh."

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, the earth rumbled from the depths of the earth.

The mountains begin to vibrate and the trees begin to sway loudly.

A part of the rock face that had just been there showed a slight collapse, and some rocks fell far below.

<blank>

It looks like you got the crystal without a hitch. It's as if the Temple of Fire is mourning.

<blank>

Rual, who remained in the air, kissed the red mass in his hand affectionately and looked down at the earth, murmuring.

<blank>

This is the second one, along with the water Hazord got three years ago. With water, the lamentation was a storm, but ....... What about fire?　I wonder if the mountains will spew fire?　Mmmmmmmm."

<blank>

Ruar gently placed his mouth over the object in his hand, and then stuck his fangs into it as if he were biting into a lush fruit.

Suddenly, red liquid overflows from within.

He sucks it up enthusiastically with a reddish tint around his mouth.

<blank>

I've never seen anything like it. ....... You don't get this kind of flavorful product very often."

<blank>

Ruar's eyes began to moisten and his cheeks to show signs of ecstasy.

His hands and mouth are covered in red blood, and his eyes have a bewitching golden glow.

There was the fearless vampire, blissfully happy.

<blank>

Let me savor you while I watch the goddess lament, Karen?　Ummm!　Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."

<blank>

The luar na lubre spins in the air, its ugly laughter filled with evil glee echoing through the mountains.

He holds up the heart of a young girl, dripping fresh blood, and with a lewd smile on his face, he dances as if he were dancing.

The sneer on the rock surface was hideous and fearless.

It melts away among the trees with an echo that chills the listener's heart.

<blank>

Rual na Lubre held high the young heart held in her left hand, enjoying the joy of sweet bliss.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Suddenly, a pillar of light extends from the ground.

It instantly wrapped around Rual's left wrist and shot through it.

A roar ripping through the air shook the area as if it were following.

<blank>

?

<blank>

In an instant, Rual's left wrist and beyond disappeared.

Along with the young heart in his hand.

<blank>

Oh, my God!　Oh, my God!　Who's ...... who?

<blank>

Rual's expression changes to one of rage as the heart that was in his hand a moment ago disappears.

<blank>

You still have the same hideous taste."

<blank>

"Oh, you?

<blank>

A voice calls out to him from right behind, and Ruar looks back with wide eyes.

When he saw someone standing there in the air like himself, Rual's hair stood on end and his eyes took on a coal-fire glow.

<blank>

The "Boku of the Tower of Dust," "The Flame that Runs Through the Earth," "The Brilliant Medicine Man of Alchemy," "The One Who Writes in the Moonlit Forest." ...... and the fearless "Heart Eater"!　Luar na rubre, it's been a long time."

<blank>

You!　Alma Marma!

<blank>

Ruar's eyes were flickered like those of a demi-god, and he glared at his opponent with hatred.

The left hand, which should have been blown off, is already back in place.

But what was in their hands remains lost.

<blank>

As if to confirm this again, he clenched his left hand and wrinkled his brow.

<blank>

I know!　I haven't seen you at ...... in hundreds of years!"

<blank>

His words are quiet, but he cannot hide the intense hatred in his eyes.

A ferocious sound seeps out of every word he utters.

<blank>

It's been about 150 years since you taught her about sealing.

<blank>

Oh?"　He's happy to see me, okay?　I don't remember you looking at me with such resentment. But how did you know where to find me, Alma Marma?"

<blank>

The wind swirls among the women.

The magic power that increased in density distorted the atmosphere greatly.

<blank>

Rual's hair swells and sways wildly.

As if the internal pressure was uncontrollable and the swelling magic power had leaked out, a flash of light exploded at every corner!　Sparks explode.

The concentration of magical power around the two had increased to the point that it directly affected even matter.

<blank>

That anklet. No matter how cleverly you hid it, I noticed the residue of your filthy magic right away. If you're involved, it's only natural that we'd look around it, right?"

<blank>

Alma gives a small laugh under her nose and gives a big shrug, as if to say that she doesn't need to think about it.

<blank>

You're not so bad yourself, Alma Marma!　You pretend to be the protector of the people, but you treat her like bait!

<blank>

"What do you think you're talking about, l'arbre na l'arbre?　Or do you have to say something sarcastic to calm down?"

<blank>

It's hubris at its finest!"

<blank>

Ruar's magical power swelled up with great force, crushing the person in front of him.

The wave is so large that an ordinary person would be crushed by its magical pressure alone.

<blank>

But Alma's magic easily pushes it back.

What did I do?　Alma's mouth rises gruffly, as if to say, "What did I do?

<blank>

"Don't panic, we'll destroy you nicely today, ruar na lubre."

<blank>

'Try if you can, Alma Marma!　You damned High Elves!

<blank>

The two densified magical powers collide with each other in a swirling vortex.

The atmosphere screamed and a stormy wind blew around the area.
