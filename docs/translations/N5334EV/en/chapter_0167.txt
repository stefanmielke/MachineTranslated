# 155 The Smile of Rual na Ruble

It was a closed space, partitioned off by blue velvet, with no sense of air movement.

A faint reddish moonlight was shining through a small opening in the light.

A large bed set up in the center of the room is covered by a baby blue canopy that reveals through it a writhing figure.

On the bed, a brown-skinned woman spread her long evening-blue hair to envelop herself.

<blank>

It's too bad ...... thought you were finally budding."

<blank>

The brown woman muttered on the bed where she lay, exhaling in distress.

<blank>

The harder and harder they are pushed, the stronger the buds that emerge from them.

<blank>

Long, slender fingers slowly comb through the white hair of the person lying beside the woman.

<blank>

"I wonder how much of a bloom it will ...... show. I've been looking forward to it for a long time. ......, huh?"

<blank>

I also run my fingers along her skin, which is now as white as her hair, as if to check its texture.

<blank>

"I spent a lot of time getting it right, and then I went to ....... Isn't that too bad for you?"

<blank>

He looked into the lifeless eyes of the one lying at his side with his own emerald eyes and continued to speak to it with a thin smile.

<blank>

But I can't help it. Let's prepare the next one. There are so many ways to do it. You're still useful, aren't you?

<blank>

The woman's thin red mouth is stretched long.

He brought his lips to the neck of the white skin lying there and pressed them against the wound there as if to peck at it.

<blank>

Well, ......, maybe next time you should just pick it right in front of you."

<blank>

The woman stretches out her long red tongue and pushes the tip of her tongue into the wound, moving it around as if it were another creature crawling around.

<blank>

I wonder what kind of flowers will bloom then? I'm sure they will dance more beautifully than anything else.

<blank>

And ......, and when it dissipates. I wonder if we will hear a lovely tone rising from the roots of its soul? Hey? Mmmmmmmmmmmm. Mmmmmmmmmmmm... ......."

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

It's good to see you enjoying yourself so much, Lual na Lubre."

"Oh? You don't like it? Clarimonde."

<blank>

There was a woman there, wearing a garnet dress redder than blood.

In the midst of this intimate space, he appeared beside the bed as if he were oozing out of the shadows without even a breeze.

Skin as white as porcelain and thick lips with the redness of blood.

Her sky-blue eyes have a subtle glow, and her platinum blonde hair flows down from her forehead and over her shoulders.

<blank>

Not surprised by the sudden appearance of the woman in the red dress, the brown woman continued to speak naturally.

<blank>

Don't worry, the cup will definitely be handed to you. Clarimonde."

If you don't put your enjoyment first, that's fine. Lual na lubre."

Of course I am amused. Because that's what Lord wants. You know what I mean? Clarimonde.

We don't have any interest in that kind of thing.

I know, Clarimonde," he said, "I know. You have no interest in anything else except being the only one for you."

"............"

"A woman who seeks only one and only one love: ....... How ironic, given our eternal existence."

It's none of your business. Lual na lubre."

You're right, it's none of my business. I'm not interested. I'm with you, Clarimonde.

<blank>

The brown woman called Luar gets up and gets off the bed, and stands in front of Clarimonde in a state of undress.

As it is, the two women close the distance until each other's chests are distorted, and quietly the two women do not remove their eyes from each other's gaze.

Sky-blue eyes with white skin and emerald eyes with brown skin exchange a look into each other's depths.

<blank>

Our true King is especially pleased with the people's aspirations to great heights. The people need trials, Clarimonde.

Your methods are not to our taste, but if that is what the true king wants, I will not interrupt you, luar na lubre.

Then just sit tight and wait. The things you entrusted me with are also proving useful. It's been a long time since I've been able to make an interesting concoction, and I'm enjoying it. I am grateful to you, you know. Clarimonde."

Yes, I think so. We are seeing a lot of strength building up.

In a little while, we'll collect the ones that have grown up," he said. If we can get the flowers to bloom then, we'll have what we want.

Well, I'll be back around that time, l'ar-na-lubre."

We are waiting for you, Clarimonde. Blessed be our founder king, Master Ars Alf."

Blessed be the King of the Founders. ......

<blank>

As it is, the woman in the red dress called Clarimonde disappears as if melting into the shadows.

The brown woman called Lual looks at Clarimonde with a thin smile at the melting darkness.

Then he climbed into bed again and embraced what lay there to his own ample bosom.

<blank>

I'll let you play a little now. I'll have to ask you to collect again. Mm-hmm. ......"

<blank>

The bed, wrapped in oriental blue, sinks and the damp sound echoes obscenely in the blue space.

A chuckle tinged with pleasure and a satisfied woman's breath fill the place.

<blank>

The red moonlight that had been shining in through the transom was now hidden by clouds and gone.
