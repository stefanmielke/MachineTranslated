# Chapter 155: The Smile of Rual Na Rubure

It was a closed space, partitioned by blue velvet, where one could not feel the movement of the air.

From a small gap meant for light, the reddish light of the moon faintly penetrated.

<b>

In the center of the room stood a large bed, covered with a baby blue canopy, revealing a writhing figure above it.

On that bed lay a woman with brown skin, her long hair spreading around her like the darkness of the night.

<b>

"I thought it had finally sprouted... What a pity."

<b>

The brown-skinned woman murmured with a sigh of distress as she lay on the bed.

<b>

"The stronger and harder the push, the more vigorous the sprout that emerges from it."

<b>

Her long, slender fingers gently stroked the white hair of the one lying beside her.

<b>

"I wonder how many flowers it will show me... I had been looking forward to it... haven’t I?"

<b>

She traced the feeling of the skin, as white as that hair, with the pads of her fingers.

<b>

"What a shame, after all that time spent solidifying... You must be disappointed too, right?"

<b>

Peering into the lifeless eyes of the one lying beside her with her emerald gaze, she continued to speak with a faint smile.

<b>

"But it can't be helped. Let's prepare the next one. There are countless ways to do it. You can still be of use, can't you?"

<b>

The woman's lightly red lips stretched into a long line.

She brought her lips closer to the neck of the white-skinned figure, pressing them against the wound there as if to peck at it.

<b>

"Perhaps... this time, it might be good to pluck it right in front of you."

<b>

The woman extended her red tongue, inserting the tip into the wound, moving it as if another creature were crawling around.

<b>

"I wonder what kind of flower you will bloom then? Surely, it will dance more beautifully than anything else."

<b>

"And then... when it scatters. Will I be able to hear a wonderful sound rising from the very source of that soul? Hey? Uh-huh, hee-hee-hee. Uhehehehe..."

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I'm glad to see you're having fun, Rual Na Rubure."

"Oh? Don't you like it, Clarimond?"

<b>

There stood a woman clad in a dress of garnet red, redder than blood.

In that secretive space, she appeared beside the bed, seeping out from the shadows without causing a stir.

Her skin was as white as porcelain, with thick lips that held the redness of blood.

Her sky-blue eyes glimmered faintly, and her platinum blonde hair flowed down her shoulders.

<b>

Without being surprised by the sudden appearance of the woman in the red dress, the brown-skinned woman naturally continued her words.

<b>

"Don't worry, the cup will definitely be handed to you, Clarimond."

"If you are not prioritizing your enjoyment, then that is fine. Rual Na Rubure."

"Of course, I am enjoying myself, you know? Because that is also what the Lord desires. You understand, right? Clarimond."

"Such tastes are not something we have any connection with."

"That's right, Clarimond. You have no interest in anything other than your one and only."

"…………"

"A woman who seeks only a unique love... It's quite ironic, isn't it, being an eternal existence?"

"It has nothing to do with you, Rual Na Rubure."

"That's right, it has nothing to do with me. I have no interest. Just like you, Clarimond."

<b>

Rual, the brown-skinned woman, rose and stood before Clarimond, completely unclothed.

They closed the distance until their chests almost touched, quietly maintaining eye contact.

The sky-blue eyes of the white-skinned woman and the emerald eyes of the brown-skinned woman exchanged glances as if peering into each other's depths.

<b>

"Our true king is particularly pleased when the people aim for greater heights. Trials are necessary for the common folk, Clarimond."

"Your methods are not to our taste, but if they align with the true king's wishes, I have no intention of interjecting, Rual Na Rubure."

"Then, just watch and wait. The things I received from you are also proving useful. I'm having fun with an interesting concoction after a long time. I am grateful to you, you know? Clarimond."

"Indeed. I have confirmed that quite a bit of power has been accumulated."

"Soon, we shall also collect the grown ones. If we bloom the flowers in time, we can obtain what we desire."

"Then, I will visit you again around that time, Rual Na Rubure."

"I'll be waiting for you, Clarimond. May the blessings of our founding king, Alz Alfu, be with you."

"The blessings of the founding king..."

<b>

The woman in the red dress, called Clarimond, melted away into the shadows.

The brown-skinned woman, Rual, sent her gaze toward the darkness where Clarimond had dissolved, wearing a faint smile.

Then she climbed back onto the bed, pulling the one lying there close to her ample bosom.

<b>

"Let's play with you just a little longer. I will need to ask you for another collection. Uhehehe..."

<b>

The bed wrapped in oriental blue sank, and a damp sound echoed lewdly in the blue space.

A sound of delight and the satisfied sighs of the woman filled the air.

<b>

The reddish moonlight that had been streaming in from the light gap until just a moment ago was now hidden by clouds and had vanished.
