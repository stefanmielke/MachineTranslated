# Chapter 120: Magic Simulation Battle

With the teacher's signal to start, the three ladies, including Ruuri, raised their wands toward Mia and began their incantations.

<b>

"Hmm, hmm— the magic formula's— deployment is— smooth, isn't it? The flow into the— magic pathways— doesn't seem to be— obstructed either—"

<b>

At the same time the signal was given, Teacher Joseline returned to the center of the student crowd surrounding the training ground, which served as the audience seats, and began to mutter some explanatory comments in front of me.

<b>

"The slow— deployment speed is— because they are— new students, you see. This is— to be expected. Well— they are— quite excellent— indeed."

"Teacher, are they truly excellent?"

"Of course— they are. If they weren't— they wouldn't be here— right now."

<b>

Thinking about it, that's true. They passed the challenging Milia Castle Eye entrance exam, so there's no way they aren't excellent.

<b>

"However! From the very first move— they are completely off—. This is— just not right— at all!"

"Yes?"

"Do you not understand— why I had the three of you— team up? There is no meaning— in a three-man cell— like this!"

"Ah—"

<b>

Without thinking, Bibi and I nodded in agreement.

That's right, this is unacceptable.

<b>

"Huh? W-what does that mean?"

<b>

Cordelia, who was listening from the side, asked, not understanding the meaning.

Karen, who was next to her, also seemed puzzled.

<b>

"Because! Even though there are three of you, to all enter an attack stance together is just impossible!"

<b>

In other words, it's about properly considering the division of roles.

<b>

"Against an opponent whose— moves you can't predict— this is— nothing but a bad move— for your first action—"

<b>

For those from Amukam, this is common sense, but do people from elsewhere not think about such things?

<b>

Teacher Joseline had properly informed the three before the mock battle to "think about the reason for challenging as a team."

<b>

That's absolutely correct.

The opponent is not a stationary target. It's natural to be cautious against an opponent whose actions are unknown.

<b>

There is a distance of about 20 meters between the two sides due to the magic simulation battle, but if this were a non-magic duel, Mia would surely close the distance in an instant and finish it with Kelna Ghul.

There would be no time to leisurely chant spells as a trio.

<b>

But today, Mia does not move.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Finally, Ruuri released a fire attribute spell, "Fireball."

Her two companions cast "Waterball" and "Airsphere," respectively.

<b>

It's a very basic and exemplary activation of initial magic.

However, the fireball, waterball, and airsphere that appeared were only about the size of ping pong balls.

Even so, according to the teacher, they are considered quite good.

<b>

Ruuri seemed satisfied with the magic she cast, raising the corners of her mouth significantly.

But the speed of the magic projectiles is definitely not fast.

If it were in Amukam... I think someone like Stefan would easily dodge them without a second thought.

<b>

<b>

Mia still shows no signs of movement.

She remains completely still, a smile quietly gracing her lips.

It’s as if she’s waiting for the spells to reach her.

<b>

Convinced that the magic would hit Mia, Ruuri's smile deepened further.

<b>

At that moment, Mia lightly flicked her fingers at her chest.

<b>

With a snap, as Mia's fingertips made a light sound, all the incoming magic dissipated.

The fireball, waterball, and airsphere all abruptly extinguished as if blocked by an invisible wall.

<b>

Well, in reality, they were indeed blocked by an invisible wall!

<b>

"The speed of the— magic barrier's deployment is— astonishingly— fast, isn't it?!"

<b>

Could it be faster than mine? Teacher Joseline said, her cheeks twitching slightly.

<b>

"Moreover, the barrier's— attribute allocation is— shockingly— heavily weighted— towards counter-magic, isn't it?"

<b>

The teacher continued, her mouth twitching as she spoke.

<b>

The caster of a magic barrier can allocate its attributes according to the situation.

Broadly speaking, these attributes are divided into "physical" and "anti-magic," but for "physical," one must also consider how to allocate resistance values against "heat" and "impact."

<b>

Furthermore, the nature of the barrier must be decided at the time of magic activation, whether it will be "resistance" or "reflection."

<b>

In basic settings, the nature is "resistance." The attributes are allocated about 35% to "heat" and 35% to "impact" in the "physical" category.

Then, around 30% of the magical energy is allocated to the "anti-magic" category.

<b>

The user must adjust this allocation according to the circumstances at that time.

The "magic barrier" that we new students were first taught is easy to use, but it requires accurate situational judgment and skilled technique, making it a very profound magic.

<b>

Naturally, it would be impossible for new students who have just learned magic to perform such detailed feats as allocating magical energy values.

<b>

However, Mia is effortlessly executing what should be impossible for a newcomer, to the extent of matching a seasoned expert, which leaves Teacher Joseline utterly astonished.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

With the magic being nullified, Ruuri lost her smile and widened her eyes in shock.

But she quickly aimed her wand at Mia again and began chanting the next spell.

<b>

Once the incantation was complete, the magic flew toward Mia again, but once more, it extinguished right before her.

They repeated this three or four times, but the result was the same.

There was no longer a trace of composure on their faces.

As Mia stepped slightly forward, they even began to show signs of fear and took a small step back.

<b>

"W-what are you?! You shouldn't be able to use magic?! You’ve been misfiring every day, there's no way you can use it...!!"

"Well, is that so?"

<b>

Mia stepped forward with a small smile still on her face. Ruuri was clearly starting to lose her color.

<b>

Ugh, that’s scary. Really scary!

<b>

<b>

Mia quietly extended her right hand forward and snapped her fingers again.

At the same time, the ground beneath Ruuri and her companions cracked slightly, and something rapidly rose from it.

<b>

What rose up wrapped around their ankles, quickly immobilizing them.

<b>

"Wha—?!"

<b>

A voice of shock, almost a scream, escaped from their throats as it continued to rise and bind their bodies.

<b>

The thing that bound Ruuri and her companions was a thorny vine controlled by Mia.

Compared to the one that had tightened the target during the entrance exam, this one seemed much thinner and more restrained, but perhaps she was holding back...?

<b>

"…That’s definitely angry, isn’t it?"

<b>

Bibi quietly sought my agreement.

In response, I nodded silently over and over again.

<b>

No doubt about it. That thin smile is a sign that Mia has flipped a switch inside her.

<b>

Mia slowly walked toward the three of them.

Meanwhile, the thorny vines continued to rise and tighten around Ruuri and her companions.

<b>

It feels like this is not a suitable situation for a young lady to be in, but... is it really okay?

<b>

Finally, when Mia reached right in front of Ruuri, she leaned in closer and deepened her smile.
