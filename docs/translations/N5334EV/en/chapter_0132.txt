# 120 Magic Mock Battle

At the teacher's signal, Miss Lurie and the three others held out their wands toward Mia and began chanting.

<blank>

"Hmmm... the development of the magic formula is smooth. The inflow of magic power into the pathway does not seem to be slowing down.

<blank>

As soon as he gave the signal to begin, Joseline returned to the midst of the group of students who surrounded the testing room and were now spectators, and began to mumble something explanatory in front of me.

<blank>

The speed of development is slow because I'm a new student. It's like this.... Well...enough...excellent...excellent..."

"Sir, are they good, or what?"

I know, I know... or I wouldn't be here right now..."

<blank>

If you ask me, you're right. I've passed the difficult Milia Castel Eye test, so there's no reason why I can't be good at it.

<blank>

"But..! From the very first move - it's no good! Mooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!"

Yes?"

You don't know what the three of us are working together for! There is no meaning to the three man cell...!

Ahhh."

<blank>

I couldn't help but agree with Bibi and the two of us together.

Yes, that's right, there isn't one.

<blank>

What? What does that mean?"

<blank>

Miss Cordelia, who was listening to this on the side, asked me if I understood what it meant.

Karen next to me seems to be wondering the same thing.

<blank>

There are three of us, and there's no way we're all going to go on the offensive together!"

<blank>

In other words, I'm talking about thinking about the proper division of roles.

<blank>

You never know what kind of moves your opponent is going to make, and this is a bad first move.

<blank>

I know it's a normal thing for people in AmCam, but I still wonder if people elsewhere don't think that way.

<blank>

Joseline told the three of them to think about why they were taking on the challenge as a team before the simulation.

<blank>

You're absolutely right.

The opponent is not an immobile target. It is natural to be wary of someone you don't know what they will do.

<blank>

Although there is a distance of about 20 meters between the two, since it is a magic simulation, if this were not a magic-only match, Mia would surely close the gap at once and decide with kernaghl.

The three of them would not have the time to chant at their leisure.

<blank>

But today Mia is not moving.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Finally, Miss Lurie released a fireball, a "fireball" of the fire attribute.

The two accompanying men are "Water Ball" and "Air Sphere" respectively.

<blank>

It is a very basic and exemplary initial magical invocation.

But the fireballs and water balls that have been expressed are all only about the size of a ping pong ball.

Still, according to the teacher, it is a good enough category.

<blank>

Miss Lurie raised the corners of her mouth as if she was satisfied with the magic she had unleashed.

But magic bullets are never fast enough, are they?

I think that would be a good idea for Amcam, ......, and Stefan would be able to avoid it with ease.

<blank>

<blank>

Mia still does not make a move.

He is not moving slightly, but quietly smiling with a smile on his mouth.

It is as if they are waiting for Sole's arrival.

<blank>

Miss Lurie's smile deepened even more as she was convinced that the magic that was shot out would hit Mia.

<blank>

At that moment, Mia lightly plays her fingers on her own chest.

<blank>

With a snap, Mia's fingertips sent a light sound flying, and at the same time, all the magic that had been flying around dissipated.

Fireballs, waterballs, and airspheres all abruptly stood and disappeared, as if blocked by an invisible wall.

<blank>

In fact, we were blocked by an invisible wall!

<blank>

"Isn't the speed at which the magic barrier is deployed terribly, terribly, terribly fast?

<blank>

I wonder if he might be faster than I am? said Dr. Joseline with a slight twitch in her cheeks.

<blank>

But even so, the adaptive attribute of the barrier is being allocated to anti-magic to such an extent that it is almost unbelievable.

<blank>

The teacher further continued his words in such a way that his mouth was also twitching.

<blank>

The magic barrier operator can assign its attributes according to the situation.

The attributes can be broadly divided into "anti-physical" and "anti-magical," but in the case of "anti-physical," it is also necessary to consider how much resistance to "heat" and "shock" should be allocated to which of the two.

<blank>

Furthermore, whether the barrier's characteristics are "resistance" or "reflection" is determined at the time of magic activation.

<blank>

<blank>

In the basic setting, the characteristic is "Resistance". Attributes are about 35% for "Heat" and 35% for "Shock" in the "Anti-Physical" frame.

The "anti-magic" quota is set at about 30% of the magic value.

<blank>

The employer must adjust this allocation according to the situation at any given time.

This magic, called "magic barrier," which we newcomers were first taught, is easy to use, but it is a very deep magic that requires accurate judgment of the situation and skill.

<blank>

Of course, a new student who has just learned magic cannot possibly be capable of such a detailed art as assigning magic values.

<blank>

However, Mia has done such an impossible task as easily as an expert, while Dr. Joseline is completely taken aback.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

With the magic cancelled out, Miss Lurie's smile faded from her face and her eyes widened.

But he immediately points his wand at Mia again and starts chanting the next spell.

<blank>

The chanting ended and the magic flew to Mia again, but again it disappeared in the same way, right in front of her.

Three or four times, but the result is the same.

There is not a shred of leeway on their faces.

When Mia stepped forward a little, she finally backed up slightly, even looking frightened.

<blank>

What the hell? You! You're not supposed to be able to use magic! You can't use magic when you're firing it off every day. ......!

Hmmm...is that right?"

<blank>

Mia steps further forward with a small smile on her face. Miss Lurie is clearly beginning to lose her color.

<blank>

Hmmm...that thing is scary. It's scary!

<blank>

<blank>

Mia slowly and quietly moved her right hand forward on the spot, and there she snapped her fingertips again.

At the same time, the feet of Miss Lurie and her friends broke into small pieces, and what rapidly grew up from them.

<blank>

The sole that has grown up wraps around the ankles of the girls and immediately blocks their movement.

<blank>

Huh?

<blank>

The girls' screams of surprise escape from the back of their throats, but the sole continues to grow and restrain their bodies.

<blank>

The thorns that bind Miss Lurie and her friends are thorny vines controlled by Mia.

Compared to the guy who was tightening up the target at the entrance exam, it seems much thinner and more modest, but is it somewhat less or more ......?

<blank>

...... thing, you're still mad, aren't you?"

<blank>

Bibi came to me in a small voice, asking for my agreement.

In response, I nodded silently over and over again.

<blank>

No doubt. That woozy smile is evidence of a switch inside Mia.

<blank>

Mia slowly steps toward the three of them.

Meanwhile, the thorny ivy is growing even more and tightening around Miss Lurie and her friends.

<blank>

I'm feeling a little bit like it's no longer appropriate for your daughter to dress like that. ...... is it okay?

<blank>

Finally, Mia came up to Miss Lurie and her friends and brought her face close to theirs, making her smile deepen even more.
