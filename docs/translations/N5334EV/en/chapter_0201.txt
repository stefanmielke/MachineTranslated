# Chapter 189: A Summons from the Chairman

－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－

<b>

"I've safely welcomed the birth."

"What? What did you just say?"

"At around thirty, I've become a grandparent..."

"What?! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!! It's been a year since we last contacted each other, and you just drop this bomb?! I mean, sure, we became parents in our teens, but still?!"

"First, calm down."

"Why are you so calm?!"

"I've already passed that stage."

"Haahhh... So, that's why you haven't contacted me until now?"

"No, that's not the only reason, but..."

"Who's the other party?"

"Ahhh, it's the second son of the Haggard family."

"Haggard, huh?! So it really is the Haggard family!!"

"...He got married last week."

"What did your in-laws say?"

"They were surprised at first, but overall they are happy. They think a good heir has been born..."

"...I see. Haahhh... That's right! In this world? Country? It's not uncommon for kids to become parents at 15 or 16!"

"Well... that's true. It is, but..."

"But, that's a lack of supervision."

<b>

"I have no words to say... or rather, there's another report to make!"

"You're trying to change the subject."

"No, no! This was something I planned to report from the start! A school! I started a school!"

"Suddenly... but then again, we have talked about it before."

"I found a good location. It's currently under the jurisdiction of the temple, but with our funding, they became enthusiastic about creating a proper educational institution."

"You really persuaded them well."

"We decided to invest in the facilities so that priest training could also be conducted. They need both funds and manpower for successor training. Plus, they originally had an interest in education for the public."

"Where is it located?"

"It's in a small village called Dekkenbel, which has less than 50 households. It's located south of the Alconnen territory. It was the site of the viscount's mansion, who was a bastard child of the Alconnen family."

"How's the location? Isn't that area mostly wilderness?"

"We plan to develop a road that runs north and south, centered around there. More importantly, the Maguarat River flows at the foot of the mountain. It can become a center for distribution using the river."

"I see, so you have a plan in place."

<b>

"One more thing. A little while ago, we destroyed a major stronghold of the noble faction, and something came up..."

"Wait! Are you still taking risks on your own?!"

"N-no! That's not it?! I properly considered risk hedging and gathered personnel, and the plan was carried out cautiously!"

"...You haven't been injured, right?"

"Nope!"

"...Then that's good. Just be sure not to get involved in dangerous things on your own! Understood?"

"...........Understood."

"..............Haah, well, that's fine. So, what came up?"

"Various things came up, but first, this. I had a high elf translate it. Please let me know your thoughts."

"Just tell me."

"'To those who seek the void, if you possess wisdom, raise victory with mercy. Its glory shall become a beautiful ring, surrounding a cup filled with forgiveness and lament. Fire and water give birth to the void, and together with the earth, obtain the rainbow. Only those who hold the golden key at the end of the rainbow shall have that door opened.' Do you understand?"

"I thought you suddenly started reciting poetry! What the heck is that?!"

"It seems to be a copy of an inscription written in Batin language on an ancient Bastium stone tablet that was excavated about a hundred years ago."

"What is the high elf's opinion?"

"I believe it relates to the creation god, but they don't know what it signifies."

"I wonder if it includes discussions about attributes? That's what I vaguely think."

"Either way, the current situation is that we don't know anything for sure. More importantly, the items we seized here are dangerous."

"What now? Please don't say it's the egg of an evil god or something!"

"It's a high-purity mana crystal. The structure of the crystal was not normal. Moreover, the magic contained within is not ordinary either. That is pure divine power. Without a doubt, it's a 'divine treasure.' There are five types in total, and they were stored securely."

"Wait, wait, what is that? What does it mean?"

"We can't handle it here, so we decided to entrust it to the temple. After all, it's a divine treasure belonging to the five goddesses. It might have been taken from some ancient temple ruins."

"Yes, that would be the right thing to do. By the way, what are they after?"

"The main culprits are no longer around. Either way, the high elf suspects it might be related to the inscription."

"I don't have a good feeling about this. Don't push yourself too hard, Thor."

"Yeah, you be careful too. The remaining members of the noble faction are still scheming."

"I understand. We both have more to protect now!"

"That's right. ...We both do."

"......Well, good luck, grandpa."

"Wait! If you say that, then you—"

"What?! What did you say?!"

"...........Nothing... at all..."

－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－－＊＊－－＊－

<b>

<b>

That morning, I suddenly received a summons.

Moreover, it was said to be directly from the chairman of the academy.

<b>

What is that?! It's like a bolt from the blue!

It's just too sudden, and I'm freaking out from the morning!

<b>

On the first morning of the week, when the dormitory supervisor came to my room and told me to go to the chairman's office before class, of course, I was scared!

Karen, who shares a room with me, smiled at my panic and said, "He's a kind person, so it'll be fine."

What? Does Karen know the chairman?

<b>

Karen pushed my back, urging me to leave the room quickly.

Well, if Karen says it'll be fine, then it probably is, but... the problem is why I was called here.

I have no idea.

<b>

.........Wait, is that really true? Do I have no idea at all?

Did I do anything wrong?

<b>

Now that I think about it, just the day before yesterday, did I destroy a valuable historical site? ...I feel like I did.

A little while ago, did I create a crater in the cobblestones of the town while dressed as a maid? ...I feel like I did.

And right after that! Did I turn a corner of the town into rubble? ...I feel like I did!

And just a bit before that, did I sneak out and play human soccer? ...I feel like I did?!

<b>

Oh no!!

This isn't just "I messed up," is it?!

Hey! What am I doing?!

<b>

Could this be some kind of judgment event?!

Yikes!!

I wish Bibi would come with me!

Huh? Go alone, you say?

Ughhhh...

<b>

For now, I panicked all by myself.

Even so, I came to the building called "The Mansion," which is separate from the main school building, where the chairman's office is located...

<b>

This place is literally a remodeled mansion of a former noble.

It's a stone two-story mansion, and while I can tell it's quite an extravagant building, I don't have the luxury to appreciate its heavy architectural style at this moment.

<b>

<b>

Nervously, I approached the heavy front door, and a dandy gentleman with romance-gray hair, resembling a butler, was waiting. The butler confirmed my name and opened the door, guiding me inside.

As I stepped through the door, I found myself in a large entrance hall that looked like something out of a painting.

Is this also a pressure-inducing setup for me?!

<b>

As I followed the butler deeper inside, I arrived at a heavy door that looked like the office of the mansion's master.

The butler knocked on the door and said, "You may enter," and a voice echoed from within, saying, "Let her in."

The tension at this point was off the charts!

<b>

When the butler opened the door and led me inside, it was indeed an office that looked like it belonged to a noble!

<b>

"Ah, I'm glad you came. I've been waiting for you."

<b>

A voice came from behind a large, imposing desk, filled with presence.

There was a large window behind the desk, and I could see the silhouette of the person sitting there, but I couldn't see their face due to the backlight.

<b>

"I am Suzy Cloud, here at your summons. It is an honor to meet you."

<b>

I bowed deeply and greeted, and I sensed the person behind the desk standing up.

Oh no! Are they going to announce some kind of punishment here?!

Yikes! My tension is skyrocketing! I can't lift my face!

<b>

"You still look lively as ever. It's good to see you haven't shown signs of fatigue from work."

"Th-thank you?"

<b>

Huh? Did they just express concern for me?

Wait, did they say "as ever"? Have we met somewhere before?

And this voice... it feels familiar...

As I was lost in thought, light footsteps approached.

With each step, more question marks popped up in my mind.

<b>

"First, please raise your head and come over here."

"Ah, thank you?"

<b>

When I lifted my head, the person was standing next to a sofa in the office, beckoning me to come over.

As I sat on the sofa as invited, the butler asked the master of the room, "What would you like to drink?"

The person replied, "I'll have coffee. Is milk tea alright for her?" I responded, "Yes, please."

<b>

As I sat on the sofa facing them, I could tell the chairman was still quite young. When I think of the word "chairman," I imagine someone with a white beard who has aged a bit, like Howard's dad!

But that wasn't the case; they were probably still in their thirties?

<b>

They had neatly styled chestnut hair and were wearing a high-quality suit.

Their slightly droopy gray eyes looked very gentle...

...Huh? Those eyes?

<b>

"Well, you must have been tired the day before yesterday. We were quite surprised by the results, which exceeded our expectations."

<b>

The chairman took a sip from the cup placed in front of them and started the conversation like that.

<b>

"Oh, was it?"

"Of course! No one could have imagined not only the recovery of numerous significant evidence but also the capture of the leader, Goul. Moreover, the complete destruction of that organization was beyond anyone's imagination."

<b>

Hmm, I definitely recognize those eyes.

And this voice too...

Where have I seen or heard this before?

<b>

All the tension I had felt earlier seemed to vanish.

As I desperately tried to dig through my buried memories, I suddenly noticed a vase placed on the table.

I became aware of the fragrance of the flowers wafting through the air.

<b>

Roses.

The vase held cute white and pink roses.

<b>

"Beautiful, aren't they?"

"Roses at this time of year?"

"They were grown in a greenhouse. Compared to the ones in the garden, I think they are just as good."

<b>

The chairman noticed my gaze and said that.

That's right; it's not the season for the rose garden now. If there are any, they would have to be grown in a greenhouse.

So, roses... a rose garden...

Huh? A rose garden?

<b>

"The gardener of the rose garden, 'big brother'!!"

"Oh? You didn't notice?"

<b>

Upon closer inspection, it was indeed the "big brother" who was the gardener of the rose garden! This person!!

What are they doing here, this "big brother"?!

Huh? The chairman?!

<b>

"Well, Karen noticed right away. I thought you would figure it out quickly too... Ahahaha! But it seems that wasn't the case!"

<b>

Grrr... I feel a bit frustrated that I didn't notice right away, but their cheerful laughter is oddly annoying!

But! When I first came here! I was so nervous about being judged that I didn't have the luxury to check their face... I mean, I couldn't!

Are they laughing too much?

<b>

Ugh... The butler also has a face that says, "What a hassle."

Could it be that I'm being toyed with?

<b>

"Now, let's move on from the playful banter to the main topic."

<b>

I was definitely being toyed with!

<b>

"Actually, I would like to ask you for a bodyguard request."

<b>

After taking a sip of coffee, the chairman started the conversation like that.
