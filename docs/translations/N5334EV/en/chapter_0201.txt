I had a safe delivery."

What? What did you just say?"

"Alaska and having grandchildren: ............"

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I haven't heard from you in a year! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! It's true that we became parents when we were teenagers, but...? We did?

First, calm down."

Why are you so calm?

We've already been down that road."

"Ahhhhhh ～～～～............. So, this is why you haven't heard from me?"

No, it's not just ......, but .......

Who's on the other side?

Ahhhhh, Mr. Henry and this ...... second son."

Haggard! So it's the Haggards after all!

...... I had him groomed last week."

What did your fathers say?

'He was surprised at first, but generally pleased. We have a good heir ......."

I'm going to go to ...... so. Huh. ～～～～～....... That's right! Koch world? Country? Then it's not uncommon for kids to become parents at the age of 15-6!"

'Well, ......, yes. I know."

But, it's unsupervised."

<blank>

No, I have nothing more to say back to you ......, I have one more thing to report!"

He's trying to change the subject.

No, no! This is another thing I was going to report from the beginning! Schools! We built a school!"

"Not icky ...... again? Surely you've talked about that before."

We found a good place. We found a good place, and the temple has agreed to fund a full-fledged educational institution, which is now under the jurisdiction of the temple government.

You did a good job of convincing him.

We have decided to invest in equipment so that we can train priests as well. They need money and manpower to train their successors. Besides, we have always had a desire to educate the general public.

Where is it?"

It is a small village of less than 50 households called "De Kembel Village. It is located in the south of the Alconnen territory. It used to be the home of a viscount who was the bastard son of the Alconnen family.

What about the location? There's nothing but wilderness around there, is there?"

We plan to build a north-south road around it. Above all, the Maguarat River flows at the foot of the city. We can make it a distribution center using the river.

Well, I guess that means we're on our way.

<blank>

One more thing. This is something that came out of a big aristocratic stronghold we took down a while ago. ......"

I'm sorry! Are you still taking the initiative to do something dangerous?

No, no! That's not true, okay? We've hedged our bets, we've got the right people on board, and we've planned this carefully!"

...... you weren't hurt, were you?"

I didn't!"

I'm good with ......." Just don't get yourself involved in anything dangerous! Understood?"

"............ got it."

'.................. Huh, well, okay. So what did you come up with?"

I've got a lot of things to talk about, but here's the first one. I asked the High Elf who accompanied me to translate it. Let me hear what Tin has to say."

Tell me anyway."

He said, "O thou who art about to enter the chasm, if thou art wise, lift up thy victory in mercy. The glory of the world is a beautiful circle around a cup filled with forgiveness and lamentation. Fire and water give birth to emptiness, and with the earth a rainbow. Only he who holds the golden key at the end of the rainbow shall have the door opened to him.

I thought you were going to start talking about poetry out of the blue! What the heck is this? What the hell is this?

They say it is a copy of an inscription written in Batin on an ancient Bastium stone monument excavated about 100 years ago."

What is your view, Mr. High Elf?"

He said, "I think it's a description of something to do with the Creator God, but he doesn't even know what it indicates."

'I wonder if there's an attribution in there? I kind of think so."

We don't know for sure either way," he said. But more importantly, the stuff we've confiscated here is in bad shape."

What now? Don't tell me it's an evil egg?"

It was a high-purity mana crystal. The structure of the crystalline body was not an ordinary one. What's more, what is caged in it is no ordinary magic power. That is pure divine power. It is definitely a 'divine treasure. There are five of them in all. They were stored with great care."

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that? What does that mean?"

I decided to leave it with the Temple Authority. I decided to entrust it to the Temple Office. After all, it is a sacred treasure belonging to the five goddesses. It may have been taken from the ruins of some old temple.

Yes, that would be the right thing to do. But what are they after, anyway?

'Cause the main culprits are no longer with us. "The main culprits are no longer with us," he said. "Either way, it has to do with the inscription. That's what the High Elves think.

I don't feel so good. Take it easy, Thor."

'Oh, and you watch out, too. The survivors of the aristocratic faction of those ...... are still plotting."

I know. We have more things to protect each other!"

That's what I'm talking about. ...... each other."

...... well, ganbare grandpa."

"Wait a minute! If you say that, I'll--"

What? What?

.................. no, it's nothing, it's ......."

That morning, I was called out of the blue.

It is also said to have come directly from the school's chairman, Mr. Chancellor.

<blank>

What is that? It was a complete surprise to me!

It's a little too sudden, and I'm a bit jumpy from this morning!

<blank>

If the dorm supervisor came to your dorm room first thing in the morning on the first day of the week and told you to go to the chancellor's office before class, that would normally freak you out, right?

Karen, my roommate, smiled at my shivering and said, "Don't worry, she's a sweet person.

What is it? Does Karen know about the chancellor?

<blank>

Karen pushed me out of the room with a questioning look on her face.

Well, if Karen says it's okay, I guess there's nothing to worry about. ......, the question is why were you called?

I have no idea.

<blank>

............ No. Really? Not at all?

Have I done anything wrong?

<blank>

Thinking back, just the day before yesterday, are we destroying valuable historical sites? I also feel .......

Did you make a crater in the cobblestones of the city with your maid cos a while back? I also feel .......

And right after that! A section of the city reduced to rubble? I also feel ......!

And just before that, he went AWOL and played human soccer or something? ...... also seems to be a good place to start!

<blank>

YABBA!

It's not like he's "doing it", is it?

Hey, hey! What are you doing?

<blank>

This is not some kind of absolution event, is it?

Wheeee!

I wonder if Bibi or anyone else would like to go with me!

What, go alone?

Oooh yaaaah~~~.............

<blank>

I was scared to death by myself.

Nevertheless, we came to a building called "Onyashiki," which is separate from the main school building, where the Chancellor's office is located. ......

<blank>

This place is literally a former nobleman's mansion that has been renovated.

It is a two-story stone mansion, and I understand that it is a rather grand building, but I don't have the luxury to appreciate its massive architecture at the moment.

<blank>

<blank>

I fearfully went in front of the heavy front door, where I found a butler-like, romance-gray, dandy uncle waiting for me. After confirming my name, the butler opened the door and led me inside.

When you go through the door, you will find yourself in the entrance hall of a large, picturesque mansion.

Again, is this a stunt to put pressure on me?

<blank>

As we were led further in, we found ourselves in front of a massive door that looked like the office of the owner of the building.

The butler knocked on the door and said, "You have arrived," and a voice echoed from inside, "Please come in.

There is already a lot of tension at this point!

<blank>

Once again, the butler opened the door and led us inside, and as you could see, it was a nobleman's office!

<blank>

'Hi, I'm glad you're here. We've been waiting for you."

<blank>

I was told by the large, stately office desk in front of me that I was in charge of the office.

There is a large window behind the desk, and although I could make out a figure sitting there, the backlight did not allow me to see the face clearly.

<blank>

I'm Susie Cloud, at your service. It is an honor to meet you.

<blank>

As I greeted him with a deep bow, I felt the person sitting at the desk get up from his chair.

I'm going to get some kind of punishment here! Will they give me some kind of punishment here?

Oh no! I'm getting even more nervous! I can't look up!

<blank>

You look as good as ever. I'm glad to see you're not tired from your work."

"Oh, I'm sorry?"

<blank>

Hmm? Did you get a workout unexpectedly?

Huh? Did I say "as usual"? Did I meet you somewhere?

I mean, I've heard that ...... voice somewhere? I think I've heard it somewhere before.

While I was thinking about that, I heard light footsteps approaching.

Every time that sound gets closer, the question mark increases in my head.

<blank>

Just look up and come this way, please."

Thank you very much.

<blank>

When I looked up, the person was standing by the sofa in the office, beckoning me to come over here.

As I sat down on the sofa as invited, the butler was asking the master of this room, "What would you like to drink?

The person said, "I'll have a coffee, please. Would you have preferred milk tea ...... for her?" I replied, "Please, sir," in response to the question.

<blank>

When I sat down on the sofa and faced him, I could tell that he was still young. The word "Chancellor" conjures up images of a man with a white beard and a certain amount of age on his face. Like Howard's dad!

But it wasn't, and he was probably still in his 30s?

<blank>

His chestnut-colored hair is neatly coiffed with a hairdressing product, and he wears a suit of good quality.

Her slightly droopy gray eyes are very gentle and .......

......? Those eyes?

<blank>

No, I want to thank you for your hard work the day before yesterday. We were very surprised by the results, which exceeded our expectations."

<blank>

The Chancellor sipped from the cup served before him and then cut him off like that.

<blank>

"Oh, I'm right, aren't I?"

Of course. "Of course," he said, "not only did we recover a lot of important evidence, but we also captured Ghol, the leader of the organization, and even destroyed it, which no one could have imagined. "It was an accomplishment that no one could have imagined, not only the recovery of numerous pieces of serious evidence, but also the capture of the leader, Ghol, and even the destruction of his organization.

<blank>

Hmmm...I still recognize these eyes.

And this voice is also available at .......

Where? Where was it?

<blank>

The tension that had existed up to that point was nowhere to be found.

As I was eagerly trying to turn over my buried memories, I suddenly noticed a vase of flowers on the table.

I was aware of the fragrance of the flowers that wafted over me.

<blank>

Roses.

In that vase were lovely white and pink roses.

<blank>

Nice work, huh?"

Roses this time of year?

They were grown in the green house. I don't think they compare at all to the ones in my garden."

<blank>

The chairman of the board noticed where I was looking and came to me and said so.

Yes, I know, now is not the time for a garden rose garden. If there is, it will be something grown in a greenhouse.

Oh yeah, roses. ...... A rose garden. .......

Hm? The rose garden?

<blank>

The 'old man' in the rose garden!"

'Oh? Didn't you notice?"

<blank>

If you look closely again, that's right! It's the "big guy" who is the gardener in the rose garden, isn't it? This guy!

Why are you here, this "big guy"?

What? The chairman of the board?

<blank>

'Oh no, I recognized Karen at first glance. I thought you would recognize me right away too. ............ Ha-ha-ha! I guess it didn't work out that way!"

<blank>

Gunnnnnnnnn......I certainly am unworthy of myself for not noticing it right away, but the sight of you smiling happily is strangely frustrating!

But! When I first came here, I was so scared that I was going to be condemned! I was so nervous about being condemned that I didn't have time to check your face. ......

Aren't you laughing a little too much?

<blank>

Nuh ....... The butler also looked like he was having a good time.

Could it be that I'm being played?

<blank>

Now, enough of the shenanigans, let's get down to business.

<blank>

I knew I was being played!

<blank>

In fact, I'd like to ask you to escort me."

<blank>

The Chancellor, after taking a sip of coffee, cut him off like that.
