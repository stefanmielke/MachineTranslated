# 63 The Rise of the Knights of Aurora

This is the first update of the "2021" series!


----------------

<blank>

The efficiency of the magic is better than it was 20 years ago! I wasn't lying when I said I'd put you back in service, was I?"

<blank>

Oh! That's quintessential Marsh! This is good...good enough!"

<blank>

Papa Howard was "breaking in" at the training center, dressed in his own special equipment.

<blank>

I had come to the training hall to observe the presentation of the serious equipment that Papa Howard was going to show us before the departure of the knighthood the next day.

<blank>

Equipped almost entirely in black, he lightly wields a black-bladed two-handed sword.

And, ahead of us, Kyle-sama, who was also equipped with heavy equipment, was blown away.

<blank>

It looks like white smoke is rising from the body of Kyle-sama, who is being pulled down...?

Is everything okay? Is that one of the ......'s that are alive?

<blank>

...... Oh, it worked.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

Howard Papa is equipped with leather armor made to fit his entire body.

<blank>

The muscles of the entire body are sculpted in relief, and the shoulders are shaped like a flame rising up.

The figure, reminiscent of the armor worn by statues of the Four Heavenly Kings such as Jikkoten and Tamonten, was truly reminiscent of a demon god who would trample down even demons.

The black and dark gray color of the face of the "Gray Iron Demigod" is aptly named.

<blank>

The leather of the equipment is said to have high purity magical steel sandwiched between the leather.

<blank>

The term "magical steel" refers to metal processed from mithril, orichalcone, and other minerals with high conductivity of magical power.

<blank>

He said that the leather material for this equipment was made from a high-threat value magical beast that Howard Papa had defeated with his friends when he was young.

<blank>

The name of the equipment is "Ultimate Ouroboros".

<blank>

From the name, you can clearly feel the atmosphere that we have defeated a very bad guy....

<blank>

<blank>

And in his hand is a great black sword.

From Coco's point of view, it is longer than Howard Papa's height, which is 190 centimeters. Maybe over two meters long.

<blank>

It has a long handle, probably 50 cm long.

The handle head is decorated with a slim anchor-like ornament, and a small magical bead embedded in the center of the handle emits a pale blue light.

<blank>

The thick tsuba is curved like an inverted bow, and its edge protrudes like a sharp nail toward the blade.

It too was delicately decorated with an ornate magical seal.

<blank>

The sword width is also thick. Perhaps nearly 1.5 times that of a typical longsword?

Still, the sword itself is long, so it does not feel martial.

The blade itself is also thick, so the sword as a whole is quite heavy.

<blank>

This is a sword called the "Grand Divider" that has been handed down in the Cloud family for centuries.

I would say its strength is about the middle of D equipment by my game's standards.

I wonder if the weapons that Battalion Chief and Master Kyle have are the strongest weapons I have seen since I came here, as they are about the lower end of the D range.

<blank>

<blank>

At the base of the blade, where the blade is not attached, called ricasso, a magical mark is engraved and glows blue.

As it was, the entire sword blade was also enveloped in a pale light.

<blank>

The magical markings carved into the leather armor in a series of pathways also became lines of light that illuminated Howard Papa's body.

<blank>

Every time Howard Papa swung his sword, a line of clear blue light filled the place.

<blank>

<blank>

Howard Papa is....too cool...!

Normally, I would be quite excited, but today I am a bit calm.

<blank>

<blank>

Coowww .........."

<blank>

Howard Papa goes on a long, quiet exhale.

<blank>

The fighting spirit that had been rising from Howard Papa's body became smaller, and the faint glow of his sword and leather armor faded away as if melting into the atmosphere.

<blank>

Marsh! You pushed me too hard! Thank God!"

I'm glad you liked it, Mr. Cloud! It's the most rewarding job I've had in a long time."

<blank>

Howard Papa sat down on a bench at the edge of the training ground, and Mr. Marsh came around behind him and moved his hand to work around Howard Papa's shoulder as they conversed.

Then, with a bash, the leather armor cracked back and forth, and Mr. Marsh's hands removed the equipment, exposing the upper half of Howard's body.

<blank>

Yeah, I'm not surprised by these gimmicks anymore. ...After they showed us that magic armored deployment, you know?

<blank>

In the other direction, I saw Master Kyle being dragged out of the training hall by the other knights.

Are you okay? I don't think you are hurt....

But that thing? Is it my imagination? I don't think I've seen Kyle-sama standing straight up hardly ever since the night of the party... why is that?

<blank>

Thinking of this, I handed the towel to Howard Papa as usual. Howard Papa accepted it with a smile and a "thank you" as usual.

<blank>

"...... you're serious, aren't you? Sir."

<blank>

Mr. Marsh was inspecting the leather armor that he had removed and muttering to Papa Howard.

<blank>

"...... oh."

<blank>

Howard Papa answered while wiping himself with the towel I had given him.

<blank>

"...you're supposed to be retired, remember?"

"........."

...... Loran's Black Rock?"

I've got to get it back, don't I?"

...... Gilberto too?"

Yeah, and Conrad, too."

...... I see."

Don't worry about it, Marsh. You've still got a lot to do here."

"........."

Sorry, Marsh. ......."

Be sure to come back to ......."

"......... oh."

<blank>

After that, the two men fell silent.

<blank>

<blank>

As you both just mentioned, Mr. Gilbert is also going with Papa Howard.

<blank>

Yesterday, Mr. Gilberto came to the place where I was organizing Howard Papa's luggage with Sonia Mama, and he told me that if Howard Papa was going, it was only natural that he was going too, and told Sonia Mama that he was not available.

We then packed up our belongings together and Mr. Gilberto was to take them with him.

<blank>

Another person whose name has just been mentioned. Mr. Conrad is the grandfather of Lombard and Aria, the former head of the Burok family and the retired head of the family.

I have met him many times, and he is a very energetic old man who still chops down trees every morning.

The Blouk family naturally stopped Mr. Konrad when he announced that he would go as well, but he stubbornly refused to listen to them.

<blank>

I didn't ask for more details, but apparently, Howard Papa, Gilberto, and Conrad used to be a team.

<blank>

Now that I hear the conversation between the two of you, I wonder if Marsh might have been part of the team?

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

In the meantime, it will soon be time for afternoon tea.

<blank>

I am sure Elrose and AnnaMarie are preparing tea for us right now.

It is my role now to bring the two of you together.

<blank>

We need to get Howard Papa dressed as soon as possible and take him with us when Marsh is done cleaning up..............................

<blank>

Tonight is the pep rally before the departure, so we can only relax while we still can.

As much as possible, I would like to make time for Howard Dad and Sonia Mom to be together.

<blank>

Soon after, while I was helping Howard get dressed, AnnaMarie came to call us. Tea was ready.

We took them straight to the tea room with us.

<blank>

Tomorrow we are leaving, and I hope that Howard Papa will be able to spend his time at leisure today.

<blank>

<blank>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<blank>

<blank>

Even though it will be the red month of 2 in a few days, the mornings in Amkam are still cold.

The sun had just risen, and it was just after six in the morning.

Today, the sky is covered with clouds, there is no hope of sunshine, and my breath is white.

<blank>

Even so, the plaza in front of the One's Tsumesho seems to be heated up by the number of people here.

<blank>

In another 30 minutes, it will be time for the survey team to leave.

I, Sonia's mother, Elrose and AnnaMarie had come here to see her off.

In addition to us, the three families of August and other people from the village were there to see us off.

<blank>

The knights who had finished their preparations were gathering one after another in this plaza.

Looking again at the knights who are wearing deployed equipment, it seems that they are not all wearing the same heavy armor.

<blank>

Some of them are as light as light armor.

Some of them have two-handed swords, some have spears, some have large tower shields as if they specialize in defense, and some have wands that look like tin canes. Some of them have a tin can-like staff.

He is very varied.

<blank>

The departing participants were divided into their respective teams and began to form up.

<blank>

The Knights form a group of five people. That is said there are 10 groups, starting with the first group and going in order.

<blank>

The first two advance teams were the first and second teams. The first and second teams were the advance team, and with the addition of the unit leader, Mr. Magritte, there were eleven members.

By the way, the leader of the first group is Mr. Djimon. The leader of the second group is Mr. Raisa!

...Are you okay? I'm sure it's all right... Nope! I'm not worried! Only a little!

<blank>

The main group of 20 consisted of four groups, from Group 3 to Group 6.

There they are joined by Battalion Commander Cedric Meyer and his second-in-command, Master Kyle.

<blank>

And furthermore....

<blank>

Please wait, sensei. You're early, Mr. Seiwashi.

'Hmmm, what are you doing, Joseline? You are taking forever to eat! Time is not waiting for you!

The staff is too fast. The food here is usually too good.

<blank>

Mr. Seiwashi and his assistant are in a hurry as usual. Can't you calm down a bit?

You are too calm, Mr. Nosoli. Have you started to become an old geezer?"

Morris, you're the one who keeps saying your back is hurting, aren't you? Your body is not keeping up.

I've been in a narrow mine lately! Age has nothing to do with it!"

<blank>

The ones who just passed noisily in front of me were teachers who came from a university in the royal capital for academic research.

<blank>

Magic Mechanics, Dr. Seiwasi Melchio.

Structural Geology, Dr. Morris Baltasar.

Magical Biology, Dr. Nosoli Kasbal.

And Ms. Joseline Joslin, Dr. Mercio's assistant.

<blank>

These three doctors and one student will be the academic survey team.

<blank>

So, this Dr. Kasbal is human...that means he is with us...and Dr. Baltasar is a dwarf.

And then, and then, oh my! Dr. Melchio is a pure-blood elf! We finally got to meet you, Mr. Elf!

<blank>

So, there are several species of elves, and Dr. Kato says that they are called Sun Elves.

She looked like the elves I knew, with long ears and beautiful blond hair.

He looks like a 20 something year old man, but his actual age is 75! That's amazing what a long-lived species can do!

<blank>

In case you were wondering, the other two, Dr. Baltasar and Dr. Kasbal, are the same age and three co-graduates!

It is interesting that they call each other "Mr. Seiwashi," "Mr. Morris," and "Mr. Nosori," even though they look completely different.

<blank>

Oh, and her assistant, Joseline, is a half-elf, who also looks like a 15-6 year old minor, but is a full-fledged 25 year old adult.

Apparently, this person came with us as an escort from the university to take care of these three doctors.

<blank>

<blank>

And one more group. The supervisory personnel from the King's Landing Research Mission.

Mr. Connor Clark, who serves as the deputy emissary. And two clerks to assist him.

I don't know about the office staff going into the big forest....

They are told that they must record the itinerary of their search and convey it to the royal capital, the most important task of the mission.

<blank>

Since their main job is not to use their bodies, I would like them to go with care and avoid injury.

<blank>

And 15 logistics unit members, including Fred, the chief maintenance officer.

<blank>

These 22 non-combatants, 33 members of the Knights, and three members of AMCAM, including Papa Howard, make a total of 55 members of the Irosio survey team.

<blank>

However, the number of people in the forest is not always this high, as base camps are set up every 10 or 15 kilometers and personnel are rotated between them.

<blank>

Today, the first day, they are leaving with 10 members of the group to pack up and make their first base camp at "The Hill of Sorrows".

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

All hands! Prepare to depart!

<blank>

In the distance, the battalion commander, Mr. Meyer, was shouting from his horse.

<blank>

When it was time to depart, the sky was still overcast, with thick, low clouds continuing forever, and not a ray of sunlight shining on the ground.

Even Dipala, which rises in the north, is now obscured by clouds.

<blank>

I guess it helps that the air is not humid and it doesn't look like it will rain.

<blank>

In any case, the sky is covered with thick clouds with a thin grayish tinge, and it is impossible to peek at the blue sky that should be spreading beyond it at the moment.

<blank>

The pattern on the top of its head, which looks like a blotched pattern of pale, thin black ink, looks like some kind of creature when you look at it closely.

There is even a mass in the eastern sky that looks like a curled up cat.

<blank>

<blank>

I remember there used to be a gray cat like that, though it was a bit darker....

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

He was a male cat with a beautiful gray color all over, white from the tip of his nose to his belly, and the tips of his feet were white, like he was wearing white shoes.

<blank>

He would come to our house at a certain time in the morning and rub his body against the block wall or the steel frame that supported the balcony.

When I put out a dish, he would come close to me and pour milk prepared by my grandmother into it, and he would immediately start licking it. While she was licking the milk, she would let me pet her body silently, so I petted her every day.

When he finishes licking the milk clean, he immediately goes back to rubbing his body against the fence or wall of the neighbor's house.

<blank>

According to my grandmother, this is the morning rounds. A man has seven enemies when he goes out, it's tough. I remember my grandmother smiling as she cleared away the milk dishes.

<blank>

Years later, when I was in junior high school, the cat suddenly stopped coming.

One morning a few months later, as I was idly fiddling with the cat dish I had always prepared for her, my grandmother murmured, "Maybe she won't come anymore. I don't know if he'll ever come back.

<blank>

Boys are the ones who travel, you know. And....

<blank>

Or maybe it was ...... lifetime. My grandmother continued.

<blank>

I do believe that the cat was very imposing and dignified.

Once there was an injury where the hair was gouged out around the waist and the flesh was visible.

Although it looked like it was in a lot of pain, the cat didn't seem to mind and continued with its routine as usual.

<blank>

That cat is the boss around here. There are a lot of things that happen when you protect your territory for a long time. My grandfather also said.

<blank>

The wounds had disappeared nicely before I knew it, but I thought at the time that the world of cats is a tough place....

<blank>

My grandmother said that the cat may have had its last days. It must have been very old....

<blank>

When cats realize they are dying, they hide in plain sight....

<blank>

When I heard about such a cat, I thought it was 'cool' for no reason.

He said, "It's cool that he is quietly dying without showing his death to others, although he feels lonely.

I remember feeling a lonely tingle and a little touched that that was how a man died.

In hindsight, I think that was literally a very kitchen feeling indeed.

<blank>

Then again some years later, when I was in high school. I happened to pass by a house and saw a cat standing inside the sash window.

<blank>

It was a familiar gray and white, reminding me of a gray cat that used to come to our house every morning.

But it was a pleasantly smaller cat than I remembered, and its behavior did not seem as calm as that old male cat's.

As I watched the cat disappear into the back of the house, I could feel the sadness I had felt in the past melt away from my heart.

<blank>

I had no proof, but I thought that the male cat was the cat of the house.

<blank>

I am sure that he did not die alone and unnoticed, but quietly closed his life under the watchful eye of the family in this house.

For some reason, it just seemed that way at the time.

<blank>

The "cool" feeling I had at that time was no longer there.

<blank>

There was only a sense of relief.

At that moment, something that had always been stuck in my mind melted away, though it may have been my own selfish assumption, without any real reason.

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

For some reason, the memory of that time comes back to me now...

<blank>

Why am I remembering such things now?

Why am I now enduring something that is rising in my throat?

<blank>

The sky is still gray, and gray clouds cover the sky as far as the eye can see, like a ceiling blocking the azure sky.

<blank>

<blank>

Under the gray clouds, Howard Papa, clad in a dark red cloak, strides forward on Regulus.

Regulus was saddled and Howard Papa's luggage was fixed around his waist.

The reins are held and pulled by Gilberto, who is carrying a large backpack.

Next to Regulus was the lanky Mr. Conrad, also carrying a large battle axe on his shoulder, walking side by side.

<blank>

Howard Papa noticed us and came up to me and Sonia Mama.

When he came up to us, he got off the Regulus and stood in front of Sonia who was standing with me.

<blank>

The two of them faced each other for a while, talking to each other with their eyes alone, without speaking a word.

Soon, quietly, Howard Papa put his hand around Sonia Mama's back and wrapped her in a soppy hug.

<blank>

I'm off to ......."

<blank>

The whispered words in Mama Sonia's ear reached my ears as well.

<blank>

"...Howard ......"

<blank>

I felt Sonia's mom's hand tighten around Howard's back.

<blank>

Please... have good luck.

"...... mmm, you too..., good luck with your breathing ......"

<blank>

The two of them, who had been embracing each other, yukked away from each other.

They put their hands on each other's arms and quietly move away from each other, as if they wanted to touch each other forever, as if they wanted to leave each other behind.

<blank>

Howard gently wrapped his hands around Mom's and turned his attention to me.

<blank>

When his eyes met mine, he shook his dark red cloak, stepped forward, and came up to me.

And then, he put his big hands on both my shoulders....

<blank>

"...... Suzy, take care of the rest..."

Ha..., hai ......"

<blank>

All I could do at the time was to reply.

In fact, I hope you are not hurt. Please be safe. Please come back to us. I had so many things I wanted to say, but I couldn't put any of them into words.

<blank>

Soon I heard Mr. Meyer's order to depart.

<blank>

Papa Howard straddles Regulus and heads toward the center of the troop, reined in by Mr. Gilbert.

<blank>

We held hands and watched it quietly go by.

<blank>

Soon the battalion begins to move.

Slowly, the large creature begins to move as if in a quiet and solemn ritual.

<blank>

Sonia and I were just staring at it.

<blank>

The columns of troops pass through one after another under the open and stubborn gate next to the Tsumesho building.

<blank>

Before I knew it, I was on tiptoe to follow with my eyes Howard Papa, who had disappeared from sight as he was buried in the ranks.

<blank>

Soniamama and I stayed there and watched as the tail end of the group entered the gate and disappeared deeper into the forest.
