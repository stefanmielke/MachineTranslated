# Chapter 63: The Departure of the Auroral Knights

This is the first update of the "Reiwa" era!

----------------

<b>

"How about this! The magical efficiency has increased compared to 20 years ago! It wasn't a lie that I would return to active duty, was it?"

<b>

"Ah! As expected of Marsh! This is good... it's sufficient!"

<b>

Papa Howard was clad in his personal gear, undergoing a "break-in" at the training ground.

<b>

I had come to observe as Papa Howard showcased his serious equipment before the knights' departure scheduled for the next day.

<b>

He wielded a nearly all-black outfit, effortlessly swinging a black-bladed two-handed sword.

Then, in front of him, Sir Kyle, also equipped in heavy armor, was sent flying.

<b>

It looked like white smoke was rising from Sir Kyle's body as he lay overturned...?

Is he okay? Is he still alive...?

<b>

...Ah, he moved.

<b>

<b>

<b>

Papa Howard was wearing a leather armor crafted to fit his entire body.

<b>

The design accentuated every muscle, with shoulder pieces shaped like rising flames.

The appearance reminiscent of the armor worn by the Four Heavenly Kings, such as Shōkōten and Tamonten, evoked the image of a demon god capable of crushing even demons.

The combination of black and dark gray was truly worthy of the name "Gray Iron Demon God."

<b>

Between the layers of leather, high-purity magic steel was said to be embedded.

<b>

Magic steel refers to metals processed from highly magical conductive minerals like mithril and orichalcum, and by compressing them with magical beast leather, one can further enhance strength and magical efficiency.

<b>

He mentioned that the leather material for this armor was sourced from a high-threat magical beast that he and his companions had defeated when he was younger.

<b>

The name of this armor is "Ultimate Ouroboros."

<b>

From the name, it conveys the atmosphere of having defeated something quite formidable...

<b>

<b>

And in his hand, the black great sword.

Even from here, it was longer than Papa Howard's height of 190 centimeters. It probably exceeds 2 meters in length.

<b>

The grip is also long, probably around 50 centimeters.

The pommel features a decoration resembling a slim anchor, with a small magic orb embedded in the center, emitting a faint blue light.

<b>

The thick guard is curved like an inverted bow, with its ends jutting out toward the blade like sharp claws.

It was also intricately adorned with magical symbols resembling decorations.

<b>

The blade itself is wide. It's likely about 1.5 times the width of a typical longsword, right?

Even so, the length of the blade itself prevents it from feeling clunky.

The blade is thick, so I imagine the overall weight of the sword is quite significant.

<b>

This is an heirloom of the Cloud family, known as the "Grand Divider."

<b>

Based on its strength, I would say it's in the mid-range of D-tier equipment according to my gaming standards.

The weapons held by the squad leader and Sir Kyle are around the lower D-tier, so among the weapons I've seen since coming here, this one seems the strongest.

<b>

<b>

On the ricasso, the unsharpened part of the blade, magical symbols were engraved, glowing blue.

The entire blade was enveloped in a faint light.

<b>

The magical symbols engraved along the leather armor, resembling pathways, also formed lines of light illuminating Papa Howard's body.

<b>

Every time Papa Howard swung the sword, azure, clear lines of light filled the area.

<b>

<b>

Papa Howard... is too cool...!

Normally, I would be quite excited, but today I feel a bit more composed.

<b>

<b>

"CoOOOOOOOOO..."

<b>

Papa Howard exhaled a long, quiet breath.

<b>

As he did, the fighting spirit rising from his body diminished, and the blade and leather armor, which had been glowing faintly, began to lose their light as if dissolving into the atmosphere.

<b>

"Marsh! I pushed you too hard! Thank you!"

"No, I'm just glad you liked it, Mr. Cloud! It was quite a rewarding job for me after a long time."

<b>

As Papa Howard sat down on a bench at the edge of the training ground, Marsh moved around behind him, engaging in conversation while working on Papa Howard's shoulder area.

Then, with a whoosh, the leather armor split front and back, and Marsh began to remove the equipment, revealing Papa Howard's upper body.

<b>

Yeah, I'm not surprised by such gimmicks anymore. After seeing that magical armor deployment!

<b>

Over there, I caught sight of Sir Kyle being dragged away by other knights, leaving the training ground.

Is he okay? I don't think he's injured...

But wait? Is it just my imagination? Since that party's evening, I feel like I haven't seen Sir Kyle standing properly... I wonder why?

<b>

While pondering such things, I handed Papa Howard a towel as usual. He smiled and accepted it, saying thank you, just like always.

<b>

"…You're serious about this, aren't you? Sir."

<b>

Marsh murmured as he inspected the removed leather armor, questioning Papa Howard.

<b>

"…Yeah."

<b>

Papa Howard replied while wiping his body with the towel I handed him.

<b>

"…You were supposed to be retired, weren't you?"

"………"

"…Is it Roland's Kuroiwa?"

"…I must reclaim it sooner or later, right?"

"…Is Gilberto going too?"

"Yeah, Conrad too."

"…I see."

"Don't worry, Marsh. You still have things to do here."

"………"

"I'm sorry, Marsh..."

"Make sure... to come back."

"………Yeah."

<b>

After that, the two fell silent.

<b>

<b>

As mentioned in their conversation, Gilberto is also going with Papa Howard.

<b>

Yesterday, Gilberto came while I was sorting Papa Howard's belongings with Mama Sonia, saying that if Papa Howard was going, it was only natural for him to go too, and he was given leave by Mama Sonia.

After that, they packed the belongings together, and it was decided that Gilberto would take them.

<b>

The other person mentioned is Conrad, who is Lombard and Aria's grandfather, and the former head of the Blouk family.

I've met him several times, and he's a very energetic old man who still says he cuts down trees every day.

The Blouk family tried to stop Conrad from saying he would go too, but he stubbornly refused to listen.

<b>

I haven't heard the detailed story, but it seems that Papa Howard, Gilberto, and Conrad were once a team.

<b>

Listening to the two's conversation, I wondered if Marsh was also a member of that team.

<b>

<b>

<b>

While I was thinking about that, it was almost time for afternoon tea.

<b>

Now, Elrose and Annemarie should be preparing the tea.

It's my duty to bring them along.

<b>

I need to help Papa Howard change quickly, and once Marsh is done tidying up, I need to take them.

<b>

Tonight, there will be a farewell party before the departure, so this is the only time we can relax.

I want to create as much time as possible for Papa Howard and Mama Sonia to be together.

<b>

Eventually, while helping Papa Howard change, Annemarie came to call us. It seems the tea is ready.

I took the two of them and headed to the tea gathering.

<b>

Tomorrow is already the departure, so I want Papa Howard to enjoy his time today.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

Even though it will soon be the second month of the red moon, the mornings in Amukam are still quite chilly.

The sun has just risen, and it's just past 6 in the morning.

Today, the sky is covered with clouds, and the sunlight is nowhere to be seen, making our breaths visible.

<b>

Still, here in front of the first outpost, the square seems to be heating up with the number of people.

<b>

In another 30 minutes, it will be time for the expedition team to depart.

Mama Sonia, Elrose, Annemarie, and I have come here to see them off.

Along with us, members of the August family and village officials are also present for the send-off.

<b>

The knights, who have completed their preparations, were gathering in this square one after another.

Upon looking at the knights wearing their gear, it seems they are not all in the same heavy armor.

<b>

Some are wearing lighter armor, resembling light armor.

Among them are those wielding two-handed swords, some with spears, and others carrying large tower shields, seemingly specialized in defense, while some appear to be magic specialists, holding staffs resembling tin rods.

There is quite a variety among them.

<b>

The departing members began to form lines, dividing into their respective teams.

<b>

The knights form a squad of five. It seems there are ten squads in total, starting from the first squad.

<b>

The advance units are the first and second squads. Along with them is the squad leader, Magritte, making a total of 11 members.

By the way, the leader of the first squad is Simon, and the leader of the second squad is Lysa!

...Is it going to be okay? It should be fine, right...? No! I'm not worried! Just a little!!

<b>

The main force consists of 20 members from the third to the sixth squads, which are four squads.

Cedric Meyer, the squad leader, and Sir Kyle, the vice leader, will join them.

<b>

And furthermore...

<b>

"Sensei, wait for me! You're too fast, Seiwashi-sensei!"

"Well, what are you doing, Joseline? You take too long to eat! Time won't wait for you!"

"You're too fast, Sensei! Besides, the food here is just too delicious!"

<b>

"Still the same, Seiwashi and his assistant are so hasty. Can't you calm down a bit?"

"Nosori, you're too calm, aren't you? Have you started to get senile?"

"Morris, you've been complaining about back pain lately, haven't you? Your body can't keep up."

"This is because I've been stuck in narrow tunnels lately! It has nothing to do with age!"

<b>

The noisy group passing in front of me consists of professors who came from the royal capital's university for academic research.

<b>

Magical Dynamics, Dr. Seiwashi Melchio.

Structural Geology, Dr. Morris Balthasar.

Magical Biology, Dr. Nosori Kasubar.

And Dr. Melchio's assistant, Joseline Joslan.

<b>

These three professors and one student will form the academic research team.

<b>

It turns out that Dr. Kasubar is a human... in other words, one of us... while Dr. Balthasar is a dwarf.

And surprisingly! Dr. Melchio is a pure-blooded elf! Finally, I've met an elf!!

<b>

It seems there are several kinds of elves, and the professor belongs to a race called the Sun Elf.

He has long ears and beautiful blonde hair, just like the elves I know.

He looks like a young man in his twenties, but his actual age is 75! Amazing, these long-lived races!

<b>

By the way, the other two, Dr. Balthasar and Dr. Kasubar, are the same age and were classmates together!

Despite their completely different appearances, they call each other Seiwashi, Morris, and Nosori, which is quite amusing.

<b>

Also, Joseline, the assistant, is a half-elf, and she looks like a minor around 15 or 16 years old, but she's actually a solid 25-year-old adult.

It seems she was brought along as an attendant to take care of these three professors from the university.

<b>

<b>

And another group. Supervisors from the royal capital's expeditionary delegation.

Connor Clark serves as the deputy officer, along with two clerks as assistants.

I wonder if it's wise for clerks to enter the Great Forest...

They are supposed to record the exploration's progress and communicate it back to the royal capital, which is the most crucial task of the expedition.

<b>

I hope these non-combatants take care not to get injured while they go.

<b>

And the logistics team, consisting of 15 members, including the chief mechanic, Fred.

<b>

This makes a total of 55 members for the Ilosio expedition team, combining these 22 non-combatants, the 33 knights, and the three from Amukam, including Papa Howard.

<b>

However, it seems that within the Great Forest, they will establish base camps every 10 to 15 kilometers and rotate personnel, so this number won't be constant.

On the first day, they will set off with ten additional members and establish the first base camp at "The Weeping Hill."

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

"All personnel! Prepare to depart!!"

<b>

From a distance, Squad Leader Meyer shouted from atop his horse.

<b>

Even at the time of departure, the cloudy sky remained thick with low clouds stretching endlessly, and not a single ray of sunlight pierced the ground.

Even the towering Dipara to the north was hidden from view by the clouds.

<b>

The lack of humidity in the air is a relief, as it seems unlikely to rain.

<b>

In any case, the sky is covered with thick clouds that have a grayish tint, preventing us from peering at the blue sky that should be beyond.

<b>

The patterns spread above, resembling faint, blurred ink, almost appear like some living creature if you stare at them.

In the eastern sky, there is even a shape that looks like a curled-up cat.

<b>

<b>

Speaking of which, I remember a gray cat from long ago that was a bit darker in color...

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

It was a beautiful gray cat with a white snout and belly, and white paws that looked like it was wearing shoes.

<b>

It would come to our house at a specific time every morning, rubbing its body against the block wall and the iron beams supporting the balcony.

With its fearless golden eyes, it would stare at me, and when I put out a dish, it would come close, and as soon as I poured the milk prepared by my grandmother, it would start licking it up.

As long as it was licking the milk, it would let me pet it quietly every day.

Once it finished licking the milk clean, it would immediately go back to rubbing against the walls and fences of the neighboring house.

<b>

According to my grandmother, this was its morning patrol. Because when a boy goes outside, there are seven enemies, so it’s tough. I remember my grandmother smiling as she cleaned up the milk dish.

<b>

A few years later, when I became a middle school student, that cat suddenly stopped coming.

Months later, one morning, while I was fiddling with the cat dish I had prepared, my grandmother casually remarked that it might not come anymore.

<b>

Boys tend to go on journeys, she said. 

<b>

Or perhaps... it was its time to pass away, my grandmother continued.

<b>

That cat was indeed quite dignified and had a presence.

Once, it had a wound on its back that exposed flesh, and even though it looked incredibly painful, the cat continued its daily routine without a care.

<b>

That cat was the boss around here. It’s tough to maintain a territory for so long. My grandfather also said that.

<b>

The wound eventually healed without me noticing, but at that moment, I thought the cat's world must be a tough one...

<b>

My grandmother said that cat might have been nearing the end of its life. It must have been quite old...

<b>

When cats sense their time is near, they tend to hide away without anyone knowing...

<b>

When I heard that story about the cat, I thought it was "cool" for no particular reason.

The idea of not showing oneself in death and quietly decaying alone felt sad, yet that sadness included a sense of "coolness."

I wondered if that was the way of a man's death, and I remember feeling a bittersweet ache while being somewhat moved.

Looking back now, I realize that was a truly "chuunibyou" way of feeling.

<b>

A few more years later, when I became a high school student, I happened to see a cat standing inside the sash window of a house I passed by.

<b>

It was a familiar gray and white cat that reminded me of the one that used to come to our house every morning.

But this one was smaller than the one I remembered, and it lacked the calmness of that elderly tomcat.

Eventually, I watched as that cat slowly disappeared into the house.

As I did, I realized the melancholic feelings I once had were melting away from deep within my chest.

<b>

I had no basis for it, but I thought that tomcat must have belonged to that house.

<b>

It surely didn't meet its end alone, but rather quietly closed its life while being watched over by the family of that house.

For some reason, I couldn't shake that thought.

<b>

No longer did I feel the "coolness" I had sensed back then.

<b>

All that remained was a sense of reassurance.

At that moment, for no reason at all, it felt like something that had been stuck in me was finally melting away.

<b>

<b>

<b>

<b>

For some reason, that memory is resurfacing now...

<b>

Why am I recalling such things now?

Why am I holding back something that rises in my throat?

<b>

The sky is still gray, with gray clouds covering the blue sky like a ceiling.

<b>

<b>

Under those gray clouds, Papa Howard, clad in a crimson cloak, rides Regulus and approaches.

Regulus is saddled, and Papa Howard's belongings are secured around his waist.

The reins are being held and pulled by Gilberto, who carries a large backpack.

Beside Regulus walks the large Conrad, also shouldering a massive battle axe.

<b>

Noticing us, Papa Howard approached us, coming close to Mama Sonia and me.

When he reached us, he dismounted from Regulus and stood before Mama Sonia, who was standing next to me.

<b>

The two faced each other for a while, speaking without words, as if communicating only with their eyes.

Eventually, Papa Howard gently wrapped his hand around Mama Sonia's back and embraced her softly.

<b>

"……I'm off."

<b>

The words whispered in Mama Sonia's ear reached my ears as well.

<b>

"…Howard…"

<b>

I could see Mama Sonia tightening her grip on the hand she had wrapped around Papa Howard's back.

<b>

"…Please... be safe."

"……Yeah, you too... stay well..."

<b>

The two who had been embracing slowly parted.

Reluctantly, as if they wanted to remain touching for as long as possible, they placed their hands on each other's arms and gently created distance.

<b>

Then, Papa Howard gently held Mama Sonia's hand and turned his gaze toward me.

<b>

When our eyes met, Papa Howard swayed his crimson cloak and took a step forward, standing before me.

And then, he softly placed his large hand on both of my shoulders...

<b>

"……Suzie, I'm counting on you for what comes next..."

"Y-yes..."

<b>

At that moment, I could only respond with a reply.

In truth, I had so much I wanted to say, like "Please don't get hurt," "I hope you return safely," and "Make sure to come back," but I couldn't put any of those words into speech.

<b>

Soon, I heard Meyer’s command to depart.

<b>

Papa Howard mounted Regulus, and with Gilberto pulling the reins, he headed toward the center of the formation.

<b>

Mama Sonia and I held hands and quietly watched them off.

<b>

Eventually, the battalion began to move.

Like a large living creature performing a solemn ritual, it began to stir slowly.

<b>

Mama Sonia and I simply stared at it.

<b>

The line of troops passed through the strong open gate beside the outpost building one after another.

<b>

I stood on my tiptoes, trying to catch a glimpse of Papa Howard, who had seemingly vanished into the ranks.

<b>

Mama Sonia and I continued to watch until the last of the troops disappeared into the gate and into the depths of the forest.

Next time: "The Sanctuary of Amukam"
