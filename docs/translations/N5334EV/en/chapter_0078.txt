# Chapter 73: Suzy Cloud's Unease

Thank you for your patience!

It's finally the protagonist's turn!!

<b>

But it's still 14,000 words...

It's really long. I've vowed to make the next chapter shorter!

----------------

<b>

The wind spirit summoned by Katie slices through the necks of the magical beasts gathered ahead one after another with its magic.

<b>

Millie shoots at the feet of the magical beasts with a rapid-fire crossbow attached to her arm, pinning them to the ground and immobilizing them.

It's an incredibly precise shot, especially considering she's shooting from a running horse.

<b>

Aria, still mounted, charges into the group of magical beasts with tomahawks in both hands, also slicing off their necks one after another.

<b>

"Wow, amazing..."

<b>

Casey murmurs in surprise.

<b>

What Aria and the others are facing now are magical beasts known as "Mitsu-Mata."

Their threat level is 30.

They have a large bulbous body about one meter in size, topped with a pitcher plant-like head, which captures and consumes prey with vines that can extend 2 to 3 meters.

Though they usually don't move, they react to the breathing, heat, and sounds of living beings, using three thick root-like appendages at the bottom of their bodies to crawl along the ground.

It seems they can move at a speed comparable to a human's walking pace, making them quite formidable.

Their surface is covered in hard, scaly armor resembling palm tree bark, reportedly as tough as full plate armor.

<b>

If you cut off the bulbous body from the pitcher plant-like head of a Mitsu-Mata... in other words, this is the "neck"... it will stop functioning. In other words, it can be taken down.

Well, since its surface is said to be as strong as full plate armor, it's probably not something an ordinary person can do easily...

But Aria is slicing through them effortlessly, proving she's indeed a 10th-level warrior!

Katie's summoning ability, which allows her to do the same, is, of course, impressive too!

<b>

"She can cut through those vines so easily..."

<b>

I heard that Casey was heavily struck by those vines while returning to the village last night.

<b>

Regulus, moving through the forest, noticed the group of Mitsu-Mata and tried to circumvent them, but was blocked by several and was attacked by the vines.

It seems the knight's "magical armor" served its purpose, but the impact was quite strong, and Casey almost lost consciousness several times.

<b>

Thanks to that prior information, Aria and the others were able to take the initiative.

<b>

<b>

Aria, without raising her gaze, continues to slice through the Mitsu-Mata vines flying at her from all directions with incredible speed, as if clearing a path through bushes.

The strikes from the vines are reportedly quite heavy, as Casey mentioned.

With just one hit, five of the 2nd-level warriors would be easily knocked away, according to Annemarie!

Moreover, the vines have sharp thorns that contain powerful poison, and if a human were to be struck by one, they would stand no chance.

<b>

But Millie is shooting the moving vines one after another with her crossbow, pinning them against the surrounding trees and immobilizing them.

I think Millie's shooting ability is also incredibly impressive. She's truly an A-class team hunter.

<b>

<b>

"The enemies seem to have been exterminated. Well done, milady."

<b>

As Aria slices off the last Mitsu-Mata's neck with a thrown tomahawk, Annemarie rides closer and says this.

Even if I'm told "well done," I haven't really done anything! Right!

For now, I nod in acknowledgment from beneath my hood.

<b>

"Let's take a break here for a moment."

<b>

Aria approaches me while still on her horse and suggests this.

From my perspective, I have no problem continuing on as we are.

In fact, my true feelings are that I want to move forward quickly!

<b>

Since entering the forest, the lump in my chest has been growing larger day by day.

With Howard and the others being attacked, it's only natural to worry even more.

Ideally, I would want to dash off on my own, but...

<b>

"The horses need a break too. At this pace, they won't last."

<b>

Perhaps sensing my feelings, Annemarie speaks up.

Indeed, Regulus is quite out of breath.

It's clear we need to let him rest for a bit.

<b>

It's been about two hours since we left the Hill of Lamentation, and we've probably covered around 20 kilometers.

I might be able to catch them if I move just a little further into my exploration range, and I might be feeling a bit impatient...

<b>

"Thereâ€™s a place where we camped the night before just a little ahead!"

<b>

Casey informs us.

Apparently, that spot was planned as a relay base, so it has been cleared to some extent.

<b>

The place we arrived at, guided by Casey, was indeed a wide-open area.

It was cleared enough to set up a small gymnasium, and there were traces of tents and a stone oven, confirming that people had once been there.

<b>

Without a doubt, Howard was here last night.

Thinking about that makes my chest tighten, and I instinctively place my hand over my heart.

<b>

Noticing my reaction, Annemarie dismounts and comes over, encouraging me to get off Regulus, and she gently takes my hand to help me down.

<b>

Everyone else also dismounts from their horses.

Millie takes out a foldable feed bucket from her belongings, and Katie fills it with water using her water magic.

The horses eagerly dip their faces into the bucket, quenching their thirst as if they were devouring it.

<b>

Seeing that, I realize how much I had pushed the horses.

I'm sorry, Regulus, I'm so sorry...

I gently stroke Regulus's body as he drinks water eagerly.

<b>

"We'll take a break too. While we're at it, let's decide on the arrangements for the local area."

<b>

Aria gathers everyone and says this.

By that time, Annemarie had already started boiling water in a kettle over the stove. ...Impressive.

Well, there aren't any particularly strong magical beasts around here, so it's definitely more efficient to take a break.

As long as I keep my guard up and pay attention to my surroundings, I should be fine.

While thinking about this, I follow Annemarie and sit down on a log placed near the fire.

<b>

"Do you all know how to deal with the undead?"

<b>

Iltar asks, looking around at everyone once they are seated.

In response, everyone nods in agreement.

<b>

Undead are manifestations of emotions like resentment and grudges... in other words, stagnant astral energy that has coalesced into a physical form.

In other words, they are the physical embodiment of residual thoughts.

<b>

To maintain and activate that physical body, there exists a spiritual core made of the original astral energy within them.

That core is usually located in the head or chest, and if you crush it with a magically charged attack, the undead can no longer exist in the physical world.

<b>

"The only silver lining is that our current opponents are a group of undead."

<b>

Iltar continues, looking over everyone.

<b>

"The leader of the knights' priests is Lisa Tuttle, right?"

"Do you know Lisa? Yes, she is an excellent high priestess of our knight order."

"I've met her a few times in the royal capital... Yes, she is an excellent priestess. As you know, the main deity of the royal capital's temple is the sun goddess Soel. Soel, one of the seven world gods, governs the sun. Those who dwell in shadows cannot present themselves before her. If the priests serving that goddess set up a barrier, the undead should not be able to approach easily..."

"Oh! So everyone is still safe then?!"

"Don't rush, Luke! Iltar is discussing possibilities."

"...That's true, but as long as we haven't encountered the overflowing undead, I believe it's highly likely they are being contained by her barrier."

<b>

Annemarie hands me a mug of tea.

She continues to distribute tea to everyone in turn.

<b>

"And the main deity of the Amukam temple we serve is the earth goddess Teril. Like Soel, Teril is one of the seven pillars and governs all of the earth."

<b>

Iltar takes the core of the barrier device from her backpack and places it on her lap as she continues to speak.

<b>

"The earth mother goddess 'Yenna of the Earth' and her sister goddess 'Kishurna of the Underworld' are also mothers of Teril, who governs life, death, and rebirth. The barrier imbued with Teril's divine energy will forcibly pull the dead back to the underworld."

<b>

As she places the core on her lap, Iltar's white chest is prominently displayed, exuding an overwhelming presence.

She's an adult... adult items!!

At that moment, I noticed Luke and Casey's gazes landing on her at the same time!

Seriously! Even while having a serious discussion, these guys are like this!!

Well, of course, I haven't taken my eyes off that overwhelming adult item from beneath my hood either! What of it?

<b>

"Therefore, I want you all to draw the enemies in and gather them as much as possible. If we can synchronize this core with the ley lines and activate it, we can deploy a barrier over a wide area, not just within a one-kilometer radius."

<b>

Iltar places her hand on the core resting on her lap and slowly begins to infuse it with magical energy.

She is charging the magical power needed for activation in advance.

The crystal set at the center of the core begins to emit a faint light.

<b>

"If that happens, I will surely subdue all enemies within the barrier."

<b>

As Iltar confirms that the crystals around the board are lighting up one by one, she says this with determination.

<b>

"The enemies are organized. Right?"

"Y-yes! They clearly moved in an organized manner and repeatedly launched wave attacks!"

<b>

In response to Aria's sudden question, Casey answers in a fluster.

<b>

"In fact, the mere presence of this many undead emerging in a place like Iroshio is unnatural. Let alone that this large army is moving..."

"Undead typically cannot move far from the land where they originated. Certainly, over time, some may cross to different lands, but... even then, they cannot move within a year or two."

<b>

That reminds me of a place where there was a group of undead before.

If I recall correctly, it was quite snowy, so it must have been this year.

It was an area about 30 kilometers northwest of the water source we are using as a base, so it's nearly 100 kilometers away from where we are now.

That place was a barren land with no vegetation over an area of 500 meters square, where just over 100 undead were gathered, if I remember correctly!

What was it called... I think it was "Anger Rich"? That was the head, and a bunch of ghost types and various skeletons were gathered, and I thought to myself, "Is this a winter ghost story?!!" I made that comment to myself... Well, that's not important right now!

<b>

Those guys also didn't come out of the barren land.

In the end, I wiped them out with "Judgment Heaven" (an area attack effective against undead).

That was quite a spectacle.

Each one was enveloped in pillars of light, and there were over 100 of them at once, making it incredibly flashy...

<b>

"It was like a Christmas treeâ™ª"

I remember saying something silly like that back then, but this time, it can't be like that...

For now, I'll consider such flashy magic as insurance for emergencies, but I've been told not to draw attention, so I need to avoid using it as much as possible.

<b>

<b>

"In other words, 'there are those who lead the enemy group.' That is the judgment made by Amukam."

"Our team, Team Aria, will protect Iltar while she activates the barrier, and as soon as we identify the relevant forces, we will move to exterminate them. I want you two to gather the non-combatants, including the injured, around Iltar and inform the main knight order to assist in the protection of those who can fight."

<b>

While I was sipping tea from my mug and lost in thought, Aria was conveying the strategy to the two knights.

<b>

"Of course, coordinating with the main force is essential. Leave it to us. But wait. Isn't it reckless to challenge an unknown enemy with just the two of you?"

"That's precisely why, Luke! It's also our job to ascertain the enemy's identity. Of course, it would be convenient if the knight order already had a grasp on the enemy's identity..."

<b>

While Aria was saying this to the two knights, she sent a glance my way.

I understand. In other words, it's my job to strike down that unidentified enemy.

As I nodded to Aria while still sipping from my mug, she nodded back.

<b>

"I'll mention one more thing about the undead..."

<b>

Iltar continues quietly.

<b>

"Magical beasts are still manageable. But the victims of the 'impure ones' also have their souls tainted... You understand that, right?"

<b>

Iltar asks with a serious expression, though her tone is calm.

<b>

The "impure ones" that Iltar refers to are the filthy corpses like zombies.

In other words, the victims of zombies become zombies themselves.

Yeah, it's just like a zombie movie!

"Iroshio of the Living Dead," right?!

<b>

<b>

Well, if weâ€™re being serious...

<b>

When a person dies, their spirit or soul separates from their body.

The spiritual body, which is the information body of matter, returns to the ether flow over time, but the soul, which is the outer shell known as the Manas, detaches from the core and begins preparations for the next stage.

<b>

...I learned about this in school as part of my magic studies, but I don't really understand the details!

After all, it's a discussion about the realm of souls and the unknown world!

Such matters are the specialty of priests like Iltar or Henry-sensei!

We were told that as long as we know the outline, that's sufficient.

<b>

Now, the victims of the "impure ones" are captured by the tainted astral energy, which is the outer shell of the soul's core, the Manas.

The same goes for the victims of vampires; the core of the soul captured by the Manas cannot progress to the next stage or the afterlife and remains stuck in place.

The hands of the soul's clock stop.

<b>

To move that hand forward, one must destroy the temporary body that captures the Manas and eliminate the tainted astral energy to free the Manas.

<b>

<b>

"You must not hesitate, even if your comrades or friends appear before you as victims. Destroying them will save their souls..."

<b>

With a strong will behind her sad eyes, Iltar tells the two knights.

After that, Iltar slowly turns her gaze toward me as well.

Is she implying that if Howard were to...

<b>

Realizing the meaning behind Iltar's gaze, I felt a chill descend deep within me.

Did Annemarie notice that? She gently placed her soft hand on my shoulder.

<b>

<b>

"â€¦Aria."

<b>

Katie, who had been meditating with her eyes closed, suddenly spoke up to Aria.

<b>

"I found a nest. It's about a kilometer southeast from here. It's a bit larger, probably belonging to orcs. This one says it smells 'porky.'"

<b>

Katie's report caused a stir in the area.

<b>

Katie had been scouting the vicinity with a wind spirit called "Green Wing."

It can survey the surroundings from above, similar to using a drone for an aerial view.

<b>

However, since it can only see from above, she said she couldn't determine the exact number of enemies.

So, Millie would go as a scout to gather accurate enemy information, which is the usual method for Team Aria.

<b>

"What do you think, Aria? Should we confirm it?"

"A kilometer? No way! There was no sign of it when we camped last night!!"

"If it's an orc's nest, we definitely want to take it out... but we don't have time right now. However, we should at least gauge their numbers."

"If it's just an orc's nest, we can take it out anytime, right? Can't we just leave it for now?"

<b>

In response to Aria's unusual hesitation, Luke's words drew reactions from the women.

Luke took a step back at the piercing cold gazes directed at him.

Doesn't he understand the women's aversion to pigs?! Seriously!

<b>

"Luke. You might think of them as the orcs outside, but the orcs in Iroshio are a bit different."

"What do you mean, different?"

"The threat level of a typical orc is '1.' This means even a rookie 1st-level warrior can easily defeat one in a one-on-one fight."

<b>

Aria turns to Luke once more, speaking with a strong gaze.

<b>

"However, there's definitely a king in the orc's nest."

"What?!"

"The presence of a king significantly increases the strength of individual orcs. They have high leadership and always operate in teams. The overall threat level of one team is definitely between 20 and 30. If you underestimate them, you'll end up in serious trouble."

"If there's a king, the group will exceed three digits!"

"That's right. If that happens, we'll have to form a subjugation team. If we leave them alone, multiple lords will be born. It's our job as the protectorate to quickly exterminate the orc's nest once we confirm it."

<b>

Moreover, they are enemies of women! Aria's strong words made everyone except the two knights nod vigorously.

<b>

I learned well in school that they are truly the enemies of women!

Pigs use women as breeding grounds to increase their numbers.

They don't stop even while the women are alive, violating them as long as they have a body... 

They continue to humiliate women even in death, making them the lowest existence in this world!

I'm really glad I burned that nest down last time!! "Pig instant kill" is definitely the way to go!!!

<b>

"Wait... something's off. There's no sign of movement... The nest is... empty?"

"Empty? No movement? It's strange that they haven't caught our scent, considering we're this close."

<b>

Indeed, I don't sense any orc presence either. There are other magical beasts around, though.

<b>

I've heard that orcs have an incredible sense of smell, capable of detecting the scent of women from two kilometers away.

Ugh, I just remembered the time they appeared between the trees. It sent chills down my spine! Zowawawawa!!

<b>

Noticing my unease, Annemarie peered into my hood with concern.

Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you for worrying.

I smiled at Annemarie, and she returned my smile, looking relieved.

<b>

"I just went down to the nest, and it really is empty. The inside has been disturbed."

"Could it have been attacked by other magical beasts?"

"â€¦That's certainly not uncommon, but... Alright! Millie! Even if there are no pigs, use the insect repellent just in case!"

"Leave it to me! I've already lit it!"

<b>

Millie distributed small baskets filled with aromatic wood to everyone.

After receiving it, everyone in Team Aria covered their bodies with their cloaks and adjusted their hoods.

Iltar also securely covered her chest... Tch!

You two there!! Don't look so disappointed!!!

<b>

"Once you've received that, cover your bodies with your cloaks and make sure to hide that shiny armor."

"What? What do you mean, Aria?"

<b>

Luke and Casey, who were told this by Aria, looked confused and asked her for clarification.

<b>

"I'm saying that shiny getup is dangerous here! If you stayed here last night, didn't my grandfather say anything to you?!"

"N-no! Not a thing? But... this aromatic wood... it smells similar to what Lord Gilbert always uses for insect repellent..."

"I see! As expected of old man Gilbert! It's a 'stick to prevent falling' kind of thing. He's as thorough as ever!!"

<b>

Indeed, Luke and Casey's knight armor, the "Heavy Mobile Magical Armor," shines brightly in the forest, making it quite conspicuous. Since it's polished all over, it can't be helped!

<b>

Well, we've come deep into the forest, so there are some dirt and dullness, but it's still white.

Right now, their armor is mostly visible, as their shoulders are exposed from their cloaks.

<b>

"Anyway, put your hoods on quickly...!"

<b>

As Aria hurried the two, I suddenly sensed something like an explosion ahead.

<b>

It shot straight towards Casey, breaking through the atmosphere as it flew.

However, before it reached Casey, I instinctively stretched out my right hand and caught it in mid-air with my fingertips. My positioning was perfect, so my body didn't move at all.

But at that moment, a loud bursting sound echoed through the area, like a towel being whipped.

<b>

The shock that occurred almost right in front of me caused Casey and Luke, who was behind her, to widen their eyes.

Casey was hit by the expanding shockwave, causing her skin to ripple.

A moment later, a familiar dry bursting sound echoed from somewhere.

<b>

Eventually, the layer of air displaced by the object that flew at sonic speed reached us late, creating a small gust of wind.

I carefully checked what I had caught with my right hand, ensuring my hood wouldn't blow off in the wind.

<b>

What I had pinched between my fingertips, squirming and trying to escape, was indeed that thing: the "Bread Beetle."

Seeing that nostalgic creature I didn't want to see again brought back memories I didn't want to recall, and I was about to crush it with my fingertips when...

<b>

"Wait! Don't crush it!!"

<b>

Aria intervened.

<b>

Why? I tilted my head in confusion beneath my hood, and Millie, called by Aria, hurried over and handed me a glass vial.

She wanted me to put the Bread Beetle inside, so I pushed it in, and then Millie added a piece of lit aromatic wood and sealed it tightly with a cork.

<b>

"That should do it!"

<b>

Millie said, relaxing her shoulders and letting out a sigh of relief.

<b>

"This 'Bread Beetle' is a troublesome creature."

<b>

Aria began to explain to me, who was puzzled, and the two knights who were taken aback.

<b>

"It flies faster than sound and pierces its target with its steel-like shell. It can easily penetrate your armor, so depending on where it hits, it could lead to irreparable damage."

"Wait, wait! You mean to say that such a dangerous magical beast... this girl just caught it with her bare hands?!"

<b>

Luke pointed at me with wide eyes, unable to hide his astonishment!

Katie looked at me with a face that seemed to say, "What did she just do...," and I wanted to scream, "Stop looking at me like that!!"

<b>

I don't know. I can't hear you. I don't understand.

Besides, it's rude to point at a girl like that!!

<b>

Then Annemarie stepped in, saying, "This girl has a special ability," and shielded me with her body, blocking Luke's gaze.

<b>

"These creatures feed on pigs, so they are usually found near their nests. If you keep wandering around in white or shiny outfits near the nest, you'll be attacked by them, thinking you're a pig!"

<b>

Aria said this as a warning to distract Luke, and the two knights hurriedly pulled their cloaks around them, covering themselves.

That's right! Don't worry about me! Just focus on your own safety!

<b>

...Wait? But something feels off? ...Hmm? White outfit? Wandering near the nest? ...Hmm?

<b>

"Moreover, these creatures emit pheromones... or rather, a scent that attracts their companions. If you crush even one, the scent will spread, and a large swarm will come rushing in. Even if you manage to escape, the scent won't wash off easily, so you'll be chased for two to three days."

<b>

The smoke from the aromatic wood we're burning repels the Bread Beetles, so when we find an orc's nest, we use it as insect repellent.

This aromatic wood also has the effect of masking the pheromones emitted by the Bread Beetles, so when we catch one, we can put it in a bottle with the wood to eliminate the scent and smoke it out, which is not a problem. ...Aria continued to explain...

But.

<b>

What the hell!!!!!!!

I was shocked!

That was close!!

It would have been a nightmare again!!

...And everyone would have been in danger too?!!

<b>

Also! I just remembered that the D gear I was wearing back then was a white half-plate armor!

That was made like a dress armor, so it must have stood out in the forest!

<b>

The Bread Beetle was targeting me in my white outfit.

And since I crushed so many of them back then, the scent must have clung to my body, leading to that tragedy the next day... Hah!!

<b>

Realizing this shocking fact, I felt myself sinking into despair.

Millie, Aria, and Annemarie hurriedly tried to comfort me.

<b>

It's okay! I didn't crush it, so the scent hasn't leaked out!!

I handled it properly, so there's no problem! There's nothing for you to worry about! Yes! Absolutely nothing at all!!

If I hadn't caught that bug back then, he would have been in big trouble, so your judgment was correct, milady. Rather, it was a divine act that only you could accomplish!

You should be proud of what you did! In fact, I was so moved by witnessing your divine act up close! Ah! Milady! Milady!! Milady!!!

<b>

The three of them kept comforting and encouraging me...

But wait, isn't Annemarie acting strange? Was she always this energetic?

<b>

In any case, this isn't the time to be feeling down! I need to pull myself together and move forward!

I'm a woman who doesn't look back at the past!!

I slapped my cheeks and lifted my face.

<b>

"Oh?"

"Milady... are you alright?"

"â€¦Milady."

<b>

I nodded briefly from beneath my hood in response to the worried looks from Aria, Annemarie, and Millie.

<b>

Just then, Iltar stood up, indicating that her magical charge was complete.

Seeing that, Aria nodded and called for us to depart.

Annemarie began to clean up the stove, Millie put away the feed bucket, and everyone mounted their horses.

I also climbed onto Regulus and stroked his mane, saying, "Just a little further."

<b>

<b>

At that moment, a sharp pain shot through my chest.

It gradually spread.

<b>

What is this?

<b>

As I felt a sensation I had never experienced before, I lined up with the moving column and urged Regulus to run.

As we progressed, the pain grew heavier and wider.

<b>

I also felt as if something was trickling out from within me, making it hard to breathe.

Unable to bear it, I pressed my hand against my chest, and Annemarie noticed, riding closer.

<b>

"Milady, is something wrong?"

<b>

I smiled from beneath my hood at the worried Annemarie, intending to reassure her that I was fine.

But I could tell that Annemarie gasped as she looked closely at me.

What kind of expression am I making right now?

<b>

"If we keep this pace, we might arrive in about an hour!"

<b>

Meanwhile, Casey cheerfully called out, seemingly oblivious to my condition.

From here on, there are no obstacles like cliffs, and the terrain consists of gentle ups and downs, making it relatively easy for the horses to run.

As long as we pay attention to the magical beasts along the way, Casey said we should be able to progress smoothly.

Luke responded in a spirited voice.

<b>

While the two of them were raising morale, I was being engulfed by a sense of anxiety that felt like a muddy swamp up to my ankles.

The feeling of loss trickling out from my chest was growing larger and larger within me.

Am I about to lose something irretrievable at this very moment? That anxiety was overflowing within me.

Regulus seemed to sense something as well, breathing heavily and restlessly.

<b>

Suddenly, something caught my attention within my exploration range.

I could tell it was a multitude of beings that were not alive.

And I recognized the reactions of the living people surrounded by them.

However, the number of people I sensed was fewer than the total number of the investigation team that departed from the village, and many of them were losing vitality.

Among them, there were several who seemed on the verge of losing their lives.

<b>

I could see one of those flickering lights of life diminishing rapidly. That was... a light I knew well...

<b>

"Howard Papa!!!"

<b>

I turned my gaze into the depths of the forest and couldn't help but shout loudly.

Yes, that's Howard! There's no doubt that Howard is there!!

That once strong and vibrant breath of life is now so faint!

<b>

"Milady?!"

"What happened?!!"

<b>

As I half stood up and shouted, Annemarie and Aria rode closer, asking what was going on, but I couldn't respond; I just kept calling Howard's name.

<b>

"Did you find the head of the group?!"

"I don't know! ...I don't know, but if it's milady..."

<b>

Regulus, sensing something, gathered strength in his legs and increased his speed.

He overtook Casey and Luke, leading the group and further accelerating.

But it's no good! At this pace, no matter how fast we go, it will take nearly an hour to get there!

<b>

"Regulus, I'm sorry, but..."

<b>

I was about to say, "I'll go ahead," but Regulus, disregarding the pace, ran like a racehorse, further increasing his speed.

I was taken aback by the intensity of his run.

<b>

...That's right, Regulus. You want to return to Papa too, don't you? I see, ...yeah, I understand now.

<b>

Luke shouted in surprise, asking what had happened, but instead of answering, I drew two silver swords from the sword holster at my waist, raised them above my head, and slowly swayed them as if dancing.

Then, I whispered the incantation.

<b>

ã€ŠThe Spirit's Playã€‹

This is the support magic of my original class, "Enchant Channeler."

Little fairies holding various instruments like harps, drums, and guitars play music, raising the basic stats of party members by 50-60%.

<b>

Furthermore, I play "three concertos."

<b>

ã€ŠBattle Concertoã€‹ increases physical attack power by 50%, magical attack power by 80%, and raises the critical hit rate and damage by 40%.

ã€ŠMove Concertoã€‹ increases the attack speed of both magic and physical attacks by 80%, evasion rate by 70%, and doubles movement speed.

ã€ŠRelaxing Concertoã€‹ increases vitality by 70%, magical power by 60%, speeds up recovery by 60%, and significantly boosts resistance to mental and physical abnormalities, completely nullifying lower-level ones.

<b>

It's been a long time since I did a full enchant!

<b>

I could feel Regulus's surprise as his running speed and stamina surged.

But I can't let him be satisfied with just that.

<b>

"W-wait! There are still powerful magical beasts ahead!!"

<b>

Casey shouted from behind, warning that danger lay ahead, but I had already seen that from the beginning.

<b>

I decided to use an item that had been sleeping in my inventory for a long time.

Then, Regulus's body was instantly enveloped in bronze armor.

There were even decorations resembling fangs protruding from his face.

Well, this is just a weapon as it looks.

<b>

Originally, this was equipment meant for a riding dragon in the game...

But could this really be used? I thought as I pulled it out from my inventory, and it actually worked!

Does that mean that "horses" in this world are a kind of dragon?

<b>

<b>

Then, a magical beast appeared from between the trees, blocking our path.

It was a "Forest Giant."

A giant over five meters tall, resembling a tree, swung its thick, log-like arm down at Regulus.

<b>

The threat level of the Forest Giant is 44.

Normally, it wouldn't be a match for anyone below a higher rank.

Last night, Casey and Regulus were attacked by these creatures on their way back to the village and suffered significant damage while navigating through the night forest.

Regulus had just faced a painful encounter with them, but now is not the time to hesitate! Regulus!

<b>

"Smash through it, Regulus!"

<b>

Regulus charged forward without losing momentum, shattering the log-like arm and sinking his fangs into the giant's massive body.

The Forest Giant was pierced through by Regulus, and with an explosive sound that shook the surroundings, its giant body exploded and scattered.

<b>

Yes, with Regulus's current strength, he could easily crush it!

The attack power of this equipment is even stronger than the weapons used by the knights.

And the enchantment is fully active!

Thereâ€™s no way he could fall behind against such an opponent!!

<b>

Understanding his current power, I spoke to Regulus.

<b>

"Regulus, weâ€™ll arrive in five minutes. If you can't make it... I'll leave you behind."

<b>

Regulus let out a powerful snort, as if to say, "Leave it to me."

<b>

"Is that so? ...Alright."

<b>

I stood up on the saddle, aligning my feet together.

With a swift motion, I threw my cloak open and drew the silver sword I had just sheathed.

Holding the sword in reverse grip, I twirled it in my hand, extending my arm and aligning the blade horizontally, pointing the tip forward.

Then, I unleashed my skill.

<b>

ã€ŠImpulse Burstã€‹

This is a close-range area attack skill of the "Duel Barbarian" class.

Originally, it is used against enemies in close proximity, affecting those around them, but thanks to my training in skill control, I can adjust the skill's effective range and power quite freely.

<b>

With a "thud!" the sword's tip sliced through the air, unleashing the skill.

The shockwave that was born shot forward at the speed of sound.

The shockwave tore through the air with a thunderous roar, cutting through the forest ahead where dozens of Forest Giants had been hiding.

In an instant, the skill cleared a path through the forest, creating a road over 100 meters long in front of us.

<b>

I quickly sheathed my sword again and tightened my grip on Regulus's reins. Then, I used another skill.

<b>

ã€ŠRiding Accelerationã€‹

This skill temporarily increases the speed of the mount I'm riding by 200%.

<b>

"Go, Regulus!"

<b>

Regulus kicked up a wind and dashed straight through the forest.

<b>

Howard Papa, please wait just a little longer.

I'm coming right now!

<b>

"Damn it! I knew this would happen!"

"Lady Aria, we knew this would happen from the start. That's why we're here, right? Right now, we should be thinking about how to catch up to milady as quickly as possible."

"â€¦Ah, you're right! Absolutely correct!! Iltar! Katie! Let's hurry!! Millie! Stop messing around and come quickly!!"

<b>

In front of the two knights, milady instantly sliced through the forest and magical beasts, causing Lady Aria to hold her head in frustration.

However, it was clear from the beginning that milady would do something.

We are here to support her, so it's too late to be frustrated.

<b>

Nonetheless, everyone seems quite surprised at the increase in power due to milady's support magic.

Of course, I am too!

Ah! The power of milady is overflowing within me... What bliss!!!

<b>

Millie Barrett is gleefully celebrating having crushed a magical beast with a single shot from her crossbow.

While her exuberance is adorable, we must hurry ahead!

<b>

"W-what is this... Did that girl really do this? And this overwhelming power! This is not something a beginner class could wield!!"

<b>

Hmm, it seems Luke has noticed milady's power. It's only natural, but... should I step in to handle this?

<b>

"Hey Luke! What are you doing? Hurry up!!"

<b>

Lady Aria gestured for me to wait and approached Luke.

<b>

"Aria! Is that girl really a beginner class 'Seer'? This looks more like a 'Lyricist'... no, a class that surpasses 'Advanced Poet' level support magic!"

"Of course! That girl is undoubtedly our 'Seer'!"

"That's impossible! There's no way she could be an ordinary 'Seer'!"

"Of course not! There's no way an ordinary 'Seer' could join our team!!"

"What?!"

"Look at Millie! You must have seen her high scouting ability and attack power! Even though she's just a newly minted 4th-level hunter, do you think her skills are insufficient to be a member of an A-class team?!"

"N-no, her skills are indeed significantly higher compared to ordinary hunters..."

<b>

Being compared to me, I pointed at myself with a puzzled expression, and I must admit, it was adorable, but I think it would be better if Millie Barrett tightened her expression a bit more right now...

<b>

"Iltar is the same! Is there anyone in the knight order who can use 'Healing' as well as she can?!"

"N-no... there shouldn't be anyone with her level of skill in the royal capital's main force..."

"An ordinary skill wouldn't allow someone to join an A-class team! Stop underestimating that girl just because she's a 'Seer' class!!"

"N-no! I'm not underestimating her!! It's just that the effects of the magic she used are far too..."

"That girl has always... from the beginning, had a high magical power value. Compared to other children her age, she was outstanding."

"Is that so?!"

"Yes! It would be troublesome to compare the outside folks with the people of Amukam. That girl was already out of the ordinary... And, you know, girls have days when their magical power temporarily increases... Oh, but I think it's inappropriate for a knight and a man to delve further into this topic, Luke Trevor!"

"â€¦Ah, well, um, I-I apologize for the offense... uh, please forgive me..."

<b>

As Lady Aria smiled with a raised corner of her mouth, Luke's face turned red, and he began to fumble with his gaze.

<b>

As expected! Lady Aria!! She forcefully and overpoweringly crushed Luke's doubts! What a complete display of strength!!

Good for you, Luke, for being a ch... cough cough! A sincere person...

<b>

Now, we must hurry, or we will be left behind by milady!

I'm sure milady noticed her father's condition and chose to move forward with all her might.

Then we have no time to dawdle!

<b>

"Alright! Let's go!! This is the path that girl has opened for us!! Don't waste a single second!! Charge forward!!!"

<b>

Lady Aria issued the command, spurring her horse to increase speed dramatically.

The horse is moving at an incredible speed!

It's astonishing that she can make the horse run this fast! Milady, you're amazing!! You're too amazing!!!

Now, we must reach the knight order's main camp as quickly as possible, so milady can use her power without any reservations!

Ah! Milady! I'm coming right now!!!

Chapter 2 should have three more parts! ...Probably three parts... If you include the epilogue, maybe four? Five? ...Perhaps?

<b>

...Probably.

I added a discussion about the "impure ones" by Iltar.
