# 73 Suzy Cloud's Chest Thumping

Thank you for your patience!

It is properly the protagonist times!

<blank>

But still 14,000 words...

I knew it was too long. I promised myself to make each story shorter from the next chapter!


----------------

<blank>

The magic sent by the spirit of wind summoned by Ms. Ketty slashes the necks of the magical beasts grouped in front of her one after another.

<blank>

Millie shoots at the feet of the beast with a small bowgun attached to her arm that can fire a volley of shots, sewing it to the ground and blocking its movement.

It's hard to believe he's shooting from atop a running horse; it's a highly accurate shot.

<blank>

Aria, astride her horse and carrying a tomahawk in each hand, plunged into the crowd of demonic beasts and cut off their heads one by one.

<blank>

Soooo, awesome ......."

<blank>

Mr. Casey muttered in surprise.

<blank>

The plant-type magical beast that Aria and her colleagues are now dealing with is called "Mitsu Mata.

Threat value is 30

It is a carnivorous plant that catches and feeds on its prey with ivy that grows 2-3 meters from its jar, on top of a huge bulbous-like body of about 1 meter. It is a carnivorous plant that catches and preys on its prey with ivy that grows 2-3 meters from inside the jar.

Although they do not normally move, in response to the creature's breathing, heat, or sound, they start to move, using three stout, root-like organs in the lower part of their torso.

It is said to be as fast as a person can walk, so it is not to be underestimated.

The surface is hard scaly like a palm tree and is said to be as hard as full plate armor.

<blank>

The honey bee has a bulb-like body and a head that looks like a vase of eelgrass? When you detach the bulbous body from the head, ...... in essence, this is the "head" ......, and it stops working. In other words, you can kill it.

Well, they say the surface is as strong as a full plate, so it's not something that an average person could easily do. ......

Aria is indeed the 10th in the series!

Mr. Ketty's summons to do the same thing is, of course, amazing!

<blank>

"Oh, that ivy attack, so easily ......

<blank>

Mr. Casey was reportedly struck by this ivy on his way back to the village last night.

<blank>

Regulus, who was moving through the forest, noticed this group of honey mata and tried to bypass them just before, but was blocked by several of them and attacked by ivy.

He said that the "magic armor" of the knighthood did its job well enough, but the impact was quite large and he almost lost consciousness several times.

<blank>

With that kind of information in advance, Aria and her team were able to make a preemptive move.

<blank>

<blank>

Aria cut down the ivy of mitsumata that flew in from all around her at a great speed, without even raising her eyes, as if she were clearing a bush.

The ivy blows are apparently quite heavy, as Casey said.

With that one swing, AnnaMarie said, about five people in the second group would be blown away without a hitch!

The ivy has sharp thorns that contain a powerful poison, and it is said that if poison were to be poured into the ivy with a single blow, no human would be able to survive.

<blank>

But Millie shot every one of those moving ivies with her bow gun, striking the surrounding trees and blocking their movement.

I think Millie's shooting ability is also great, good and great. She is a quintessential Class A team hunter.

<blank>

<blank>

The enemy seems to have been exterminated. Thank you for your hard work, young lady."

<blank>

AnnaMarie pulled up her horse and said so, just as Aria slashed away the neck of the last Mitsu Mata with a tomahawk she had thrown.

I'm not really doing anything, though! Duh!

For now, I'll just nod behind the hood.

<blank>

Let's take a break here.

<blank>

Aria came to me on horseback and made this suggestion.

From my point of view, I have no problem if they go ahead with it.

I'd rather move on quickly! I really want to move on!

<blank>

Since I entered the forest, the lump-like thing on my chest that had been there for a few days was getting bigger and bigger.

It is only natural to be concerned because Howard Papa and his family are being attacked.

If it were true, I'd like to fly there by myself. ......

<blank>

The horse needs a break. At this pace, the horses will not last.

<blank>

AnnaMarie, perhaps sensing my feelings, spoke to me.

Indeed, Regulus is also very much out of breath.

There is no doubt that he needs to give it a rest.

<blank>

It has been about two hours since we left the hill of sorrows, and we must have run about 20 kilometers already.

I may be a little impatient, thinking that if I make a little more progress, I may be able to capture it within my search area. ......

<blank>

Just a little further down the road is the spot where we camped the night before!"

<blank>

Mr. Casey told me so.

The area had been the site of a planned relay station, so the land had been cleared to some extent.

<blank>

The place where we arrived, led by Mr. Casey, was indeed a widely paved area.

The site, which had been cleared to the point where a small gymnasium could be erected, was covered with the remains of tents and hearths piled with stones, and it was certain that the warmth of human presence remained there.

<blank>

Without a doubt, Howard Papa was here last night.

When I thought of that, I felt my chest tightening and I brought my hand to my chest unintentionally.

<blank>

Perhaps noticing me, AnnaMarie dismounted from her horse and came to my side, urging me to dismount from Regulus, and then took my hand and let me down.

<blank>

Everyone was getting off their horses.

Millie took a folding manger out of her luggage and spread it out, into which Ketty filled it full of water with the magic of Water.

In a tub the size of a kiddie pool, the horses plunge their faces in and satisfy their thirst for food.

<blank>

Seeing them made me realize how much I had pushed the horses too hard.

Sorry Regulus, sorry .......

I patted Regulus' body as he drank water absorbedly.

<blank>

We'll take a short break too. We'll also decide on the arrangements to be made at the site.

<blank>

Aria said and gathered everyone together.

AnnaMarie had already started to heat the kettle on the stove and boil water by that time. ......Susuga.

Well, there are not so powerful magical beasts around here, and a little break would definitely improve efficiency.

All I have to do is keep my guard up and be aware of my surroundings.

With these thoughts in mind, AnnaMarie took me to sit down on a log placed by the fire.

<blank>

You know how to deal with the undead, don't you?"

<blank>

Mr. Irta asked me to confirm this when we were all seated.

In response, everyone nodded their heads in agreement.

<blank>

Undead are dull emotions such as passions and grudges ......, in other words, stagnant astral that has been caught up in the ether and materialized.

It is, so to speak, the materialization of a residual thought.

<blank>

And in order to maintain and activate the materialized body, there is a spiritual core made of the original astral in its body.

They are usually found in the head or chest, and if they are destroyed by a magical attack, the undead will not be able to exist in this world.

<blank>

The only saving grace is that this time we're dealing with a bunch of undead.

<blank>

Mr. Irta continues to go on, looking around at everyone.

<blank>

The leader of the Order's priests was Lissa Tuttle, wasn't it?"

You know Lisa?" Yes, I do. She is an excellent High Priestess of our Order."

"I've seen her a few times in King's Landing ....... Yes, she is an excellent chief priestess. As you know, the chief deity of the Royal City Temple is Soel the Sun. Soel, one of the seven world gods, is the goddess of the sun. Those who dwell in the shadows cannot appear before her. If they, the priestesses who serve the goddess, put up a ward, the undead will not be able to approach so easily. ......

Oh, so everyone is still safe? So everyone is still safe?

Don't be hasty, Luke! Iltá is talking about possibilities."

...... Well, it's a bit of a guess, but ...... I think it's more likely that they're holding them back with wards, since they haven't encountered the overflow of the undead yet."

<blank>

AnnaMarie handed me a mug of tea.

AnnaMarie then continues to distribute tea to everyone in turn.

<blank>

And the chief deity of the Temple of Amukam, which we serve, is Terrill of the earth. Teriru, who is also one of the seven pillars, presides over all the earth.

<blank>

Mr. Irta took the core of the warding device out of his sack and placed it on his lap as he continued his story.

<blank>

She is the mother goddess of Jenna of the Earth, the earth mother goddess of Amukam, and her sister goddess Kishruna of the Underworld, the great goddess of life, death, and rebirth. Teril's divinely charged wards will inevitably draw the dead back to the underworld.

<blank>

As we placed the core on our knees, Irta's white bosom was thrust in front of us with an overwhelming presence, as if spilling out from her bare cloak.

Adults. ....... It's an adult item!

At this time, I observed that both Luke's and Casey's eyes caught it at the same time!

I'm in the middle of a serious conversation, and this is what I get from men! I was in the middle of a serious conversation, and this is what I get from men!

Well, of course, I too have not taken my eyes off the overwhelming adult possessions from behind the hood! What is it?

<blank>

So, I want you all to draw the enemy as close as you can and keep them close. If we can synchronize this core with the earth's veins and activate it properly, we can deploy wards over a wider area than a one-kilometer radius.

<blank>

Irta-san places his hand on the core on his lap and slowly cages in the magic power.

They are to fill it with the magic power needed for activation while they are at it.

The crystal set in the center of the core began to glow with a pale light.

<blank>

If that happens, I will surely subdue all the enemies within the boundaries."

<blank>

Irta said emphatically as she checked that the crystals around the board were also lit up, one by one, in turn.

<blank>

This time the enemy is in control. Isn't that right?"

Yes, sir! It was clearly a controlled movement, and the attack was repeated in waves!"

<blank>

Casey answered Aria's abrupt question in a flustered manner.

<blank>

In fact, it's unnatural for so many undead to spring up in a place like this in Ilocio. And moreover, for such a large army of them to be on the move. ......"

The undead can't move very far from where they originated," he said. It's true that over time they can cross over to different places, ......, but even so, they can't move in a year or two.

<blank>

I remember a place where there was a group of undead before.

As I recall, there was quite a bit of snow on the ground, so I'm not sure if it was just this year.

<blank>

It was a wasteland about 30 kilometers northwest of our watering hole, which is almost 100 kilometers from where we are now.

It was a wasteland with no vegetation in a 500-meter square area, where a little more than 100 undead were hanging out, as I recall!

<blank>

What was it ......, I think it was 'Anger Rich'? That was the head, and there were all kinds of ghosts and skeletons of all sizes, and I thought to myself, "Is this a winter ghost story? I remember I was alone in the room and said to myself, "This is a winter ghost story. ....... Well, that doesn't matter now!

<blank>

They didn't come out of the wasteland that time, either, as I recall.

I ended up wiping them out with "Judgment Heaven" (an undead special ranged attack).

That was fancy, wasn't it?

Each body was surrounded by a pillar of light, and it was so flashy, more than 100 at a time. ......

<blank>

It's like a Christmas tree.

I said something like that in my sleep at the time, but I can't say that this time. ......

For now, I'll consider that kind of flashy magic as an insurance policy in case something happens, but I've been told not to do anything conspicuous, so I should try not to use it as much as possible.

<blank>

<blank>

"So, 'there are people who are leading the enemy group. That's what Amkam did.

The two of you are to gather the non-combatants, including the wounded, around Iltar and inform the main body of the Order that those who are able to fight are to escort him. I want you two to tell the main body of the Order to gather the non-combatants, including the wounded, around Irta and to escort those who are able to fight with them.

<blank>

While I was sipping from my mug and thinking, Aria was informing the two members of the knightly order about the local strategy.

<blank>

It's only natural that I should coordinate with the main group, leave it to you." But wait. Isn't it reckless to suddenly take on an unknown enemy by yourselves?

That's why! Luke! It's our job to find out who the enemy is. But if the Knights already know who the enemy is, there will be no trouble. ......

<blank>

Aria was saying such things to two of the knights, but they were coming to look at me.

I understand. In short, it is my role to strike that unidentified enemy.

I nodded to Aria with my mouth on the mug, and she nodded back.

<blank>

I have one more thing to say about the undead: ......

<blank>

Mr. Irta continued to speak quietly.

<blank>

'If it's a hexenbiest, that's still fine. But the victims of the 'impure ones' also have their souls defiled ....... You know that, don't you?"

<blank>

Irta-san asks with a quiet but stern look on his face.

<blank>

The "unclean ones" that Mr. Irta refers to are zombies and other unclean corpses.

That is to say, zombie victims become zombies.

Yes, a zombie movie indeed!

Iroshio of the Living Dead!

<blank>

<blank>

Well, in all seriousness, you can go to .......

<blank>

When a person dies, the spirit or soul leaves his or her body.

The spirit, the informational body of matter, returns to the etheric current with the passage of time, but the soul, with its core separated from its outer shell, manas, begins to prepare for the next stage.

<blank>

...... I'm learning about this stuff in school as part of my magic studies, but I don't really know the details myself!

It's usually about the realm of the soul or the unknown!

This is the specialty of priests such as Irta and Dr. Henry!

We are told that all we need is a general overview.

<blank>

So, the victims of these "impure ones" are said to be caught in the dirty astral, the outer shell of the soul, the manas, from which the core has been separated.

As is the case with vampire victims, the core of souls captured by manas will remain in place, unable to move on to the next stage or to the next life.

The clock of the soul stops ticking.

<blank>

The only way to advance that needle is to destroy the temporary body that holds Manas captive and the tainted astral and release Manas.

<blank>

<blank>

When your friends and associates appear before you as victims, don't hesitate. To destroy them is to save their souls. ......"

<blank>

With eyes filled with sorrow but also with a strong will, Ms. Irta told the two members of the knightly order.

Then, slowly, Iltar-san came to me with the same gaze.

Is that what you would like to say, if Howard Papa is ......, or ......?

<blank>

I felt a coldness descend to my core as I realized what Irta's eyes were telling me.

Did she notice that? AnnaMarie gently and softly placed her hand on my shoulder.

<blank>

<blank>

...... aria."

<blank>

Ms. Ketty, whose eyelids had been closed as if she were meditating, slowly approached Alia.

<blank>

I found a nest. It's about a kilometer or less southeast of here. It's a little big, probably an oak. This one says it smells like a pig."

<blank>

Ketty's report caused the place to turn colorful.

<blank>

Ms. Ketty was using summoning magic to patrol the area.

It is a wind spirit called "Green Wing" that can see its surroundings from above.

It seems to be just like using a drone to get a bird's eye view of your surroundings.

<blank>

But he said that since he was only looking at it from above, he couldn't get a detailed count of the opponents or anything.

So, Millie went to the scouts to get accurate information about the enemy, which is what Team Aria always does, he said.

<blank>

What do you say, Alia? Do you want me to check?"

Less than a kilo? Oh no! There was no sign or report of such when we encamped last night!"

"If it's a hog's nest, I want to make sure it gets squashed, ......, but right now I don't have time. But we do need to have an idea of the numbers."

I'm sure we could crush a nest of orcs any time we wanted to. Why don't we just leave it alone for now?"

<blank>

The women responded to Luke's words to Aria, who was unusually distressed.

Mr. Luke takes a step back at the cold stare that unexpectedly pierced his eyes.

I wonder if men don't understand women's aversion to pigs? Not at all!

<blank>

Luke. You may think they are the same as the orcs outside, but the orcs in Irosio are a little different."

"Out there? What's the difference?"

The threat value of a normal orc is '1'. This is an opponent that a 1st generation chick could easily take down in a tussle."

<blank>

Aria turned to Mr. Luke again and began to speak with a strong gaze.

<blank>

But in Irosio's nest of orcs, there is definitely a king."

What?

The presence of the king also boosts the strength of the orcs on their own. The threat value of a single team is definitely between 20 and 30. If you underestimate them, you will be in for a world of pain."

"Ki, if the King is here, the herd will eventually exceed three digits!"

He said, "Yes, that's right. If that happens, we'll have to form a strike force. If left unchecked, loads and loads of them will be born. It is the job of the Protection Squad to quickly exterminate the pigs' nests as soon as they are identified.

<blank>

And above all, they are the enemy of women!　Aria's strong words made all but two of the knights nod their heads in agreement.

<blank>

I was taught well in school before, but they really are the natural enemy of women!

Pigs use women as a nursery to increase their mate.

They say they don't stay with the women while they are alive, but continue to rape them and use them as nurseries as long as they have bodies. ......

He is the lowest being on earth who continues to humiliate women even in death!

I'm so glad I left the whole hive burned clean that time! I knew "Pigs Quickly Cut" was the way to go!

<blank>

Wait," he said. ....... Funny, no sign of anything moving. Is the ...... nest ...... empty?"

"Kara? No movement? It's funny how we're at this distance and they're not even sniffing us out."

<blank>

Indeed, I have not felt any sign of orcs either. There are signs of other magical beasts, though.

<blank>

The sense of smell of orcs is so great that they can smell a woman two kilometers away.

Oh man, I remember when those guys came out of the trees. I got the creeps! I got the creeps!

<blank>

AnnaMarie noticed my appearance and peeked inside my hood with concern.

Unh, I'm fine. Thanks for worrying about me.

I smiled at AnnaMarie, and she smiled back, as if relieved.

<blank>

I just went down to the nest and it's still empty. The nest has been ransacked."

'You weren't attacked by another hexenbiest, were you?'

"...... It's certainly not uncommon for that to happen, though. ...... OK! Millie! There may be no pigs here, but just in case, use the bug repellent!"

Leave it to me! It's already burning!"

<blank>

Millie handed out small baskets of burned incense wood to each of us.

Upon receiving it, everyone on Team Aria covered their bodies with their cloaks and put their hoods back on.

Ilta also hid her chest in a sissy ...... tch!

You two there! Don't look so disappointed!

<blank>

When you receive it, cover yourselves with your cloaks and hide your shiny armor well.

What? What do you mean, Alia?

<blank>

When Aria told them this, Luke and Casey looked unsure and asked Aria again.

<blank>

I'm telling you, your sparkly outfit is not safe here! If you stayed here yesterday, did our old man say anything to you?

No, no! Nothing? But ......, is this fragrant wood ......? This fragrance is similar to the one that Gilbert used to burn to repel insects. ......

I see! That's Gilbert's old man! I see what you mean by 'a cane before you fall'. As usual, he's always on top of things!

<blank>

Indeed, the knight's armor "Heavy Mobile Magic Armor" that Mr. Luke and Ms. Casey are equipped with is shiny and quite conspicuous when you look at it again in the forest. It's a polished armor all over, so it can't be helped if I say it can't be helped!

<blank>

Well, it has been going deeper into the forest, so some dirt and dullness has appeared, but it is still white.

It is even more noticeable now that his shoulders are out from his cloak and his entire body of armor is almost visible on the outside.

<blank>

Just get your hood on quick ......!"

<blank>

Aria was rushing the two of us. At that moment, I caught a sign of something exploding ahead of us.

<blank>

It flew in a straight line toward Mr. Casey, piercing the atmosphere.

However, before reaching Mr. Casey, I momentarily extend only my right hand and catch it in mid-air with my fingertips. Since I am perfectly positioned, my body is not moving at all, just my right hand.

But at that moment, I let out a loud popping sound, like the sound you make when you shake off your towel, and it echoed through the place in a grand way.

<blank>

Casey and Luke, who was behind her, opened their eyes at the shock that occurred almost in front of them.

Ms. Casey's face skin shook and rippled as she took the brunt of the spreading shock.

A beat later came a dry popping sound that I remembered hearing somewhere.

<blank>

Soon, the layer of air pushed away by the object flying at the speed of sound reached our location with a delay, creating a small wind.

I checked what I had grabbed with my right hand, being careful not to let the wind blow my hood up.

<blank>

Pinched at the tip of the finger, wriggling around trying to escape from it is this guy, "Bread Beetle" after all.

For the first time in a long time, I saw an old partner that I didn't want to see, and the past that I didn't want to remember came back to me, so I tried to put pressure on my fingertips to crush him as it were. ......

<blank>

Wait! Don't crush it!

<blank>

And Aria came in to stop me.

<blank>

Why?　When I tilted my head in my hood dubiously, Millie, who had been called by Aria, came running to me in a panic and held out a glass vial.

He told me to put a Bread Beetle in it, so I shoved it inside, and Millie put a piece of lit incense wood in it as well, and corked it tightly with a cork.

<blank>

That's good!"

<blank>

With that, Millie relaxed her shoulders and exhaled, as if relieved.

<blank>

This 'Bread Beetle' is a nasty one.

<blank>

As if to explain to me, who had a dubious look on my face, and the two knights who were dumbfounded, Aria began to talk.

<blank>

It flies faster than it sounds, and its steel-hard shell can punch through a target. It can penetrate your armor so easily, depending on where it hits, you could be in deep trouble.

Wait a minute! You're telling me that you've caught ...... such an extraordinary magical beast, and now this kid has caught ...... it with his bare hands?

<blank>

Mr. Luke came pointing at me with wide-open eyes, making no attempt to hide his surprise!

Ketty, don't look at me like I've done it ......!

<blank>

I don't know. I can't hear. I don't know.

Besides, it's rude to point at a girl like that!

<blank>

Then AnnaMarie told me that she had special eyes and shielded me behind her body to shield me from Luke's gaze.

<blank>

They feed on pigs, so you can usually find them near their nests. If you keep hanging around near their nests looking white and shiny like that, you will be attacked by these guys who recognize you as a pig!

<blank>

When Aria uttered a threatening remark to distract Mr. Luke, the two of them pulled the cloak off their backs and wrapped it inside, as if in a panic.

Yes, yes, yes! Don't worry about the Kochs, just take care of your own safety!

<blank>

...... Huh? But it's stuck on Nanka? ...... Hmm? In a white outfit? Hanging around near the nest? ...... hmm?

<blank>

And these guys, they emit pheromones? ......, or rather, they emit a smell that attracts them. If you destroy even one of them, the smell will overflow the area, and a swarm will immediately come in. Even if you manage to escape, you will be chased around for two or three days because the scent doesn't come off easily, even if you wash it off with water.

<blank>

<blank>

The smoke from the incense wood he is burning now is not liked by Bledbeetle, so when he finds a nest of oaks, he uses this as an insect repellent.

This fragrant wood also has the effect of eliminating the pheromones produced by breadbeetles, so when you catch them like this, you can bottle them together to eliminate the smell and smother them to death, no problem. ...... and Aria went on to tell me about ......, though.

<blank>

What the heck: ！！！！！

I was shocked!

It was a dangerous place!

The nightmare again! It will be!

......, or I would have put you all in danger!

<blank>

Besides, I remembered that the D equipment I was wearing at that time was white half-plate armor! I remembered that the D equipment I was wearing at that time was white half-plate armor!

That was made like dress armor, so it should have been white and floated in the forest anyway!

<blank>

Bread Beetle was attacking me in my white form.

And because I crushed it so much at the time, the smell seeped into my body, leading to that tragedy the next day ............ hah!

<blank>

I was so depressed after the shocking revelation that I sank to the ground! I was so depressed that I sank to the ground, and Millie, Aria, and AnnaMarie comforted me in a panicked manner.

<blank>

It's okay! We haven't crushed it, so no odor has leaked out!

I've taken care of it, there's nothing wrong with it! There's nowhere for you to worry about! Unh! Nowhere at all at all!

If he had not caught the bug at that time, he would have been in serious trouble, so the young lady's judgment was right. Rather, it is because it was the young lady that she was able to do this divine work!

The young lady has just done something she should be proud of! In fact, I am even moved by the shock of being able to see her divine work up close! Ah! My Lady! Miss! Miss ah!

<blank>

The three of us were constantly comforting and encouraging us. ......

I mean, what's wrong with AnnaMary? I wonder if she was such a tension ......?

<blank>

Anyway, this is no time to be depressed here! Now I have to get my head out of my ass and move on!

I am a woman who does not look back!

I slapped both cheeks and looked up.

<blank>

Oh?"

Miss ......, are you all right?"

...... miss."

<blank>

I nodded briefly behind my hood and said, "Yes!　and nodded briefly behind her hood.

<blank>

Just then, Mr. Irta stood up to say that he was finished charging his magic.

Aria sees this and nods, "Let's go!　and gave the order.

AnnaMarie puts away the stove, Millie puts away the manger, and everyone goes astride their horses.

I climbed on top of Regulus and stroked his mane, saying, "We're almost there.

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, I felt a sensation similar to a prickling pain in my chest.

It spreads out in a jiffy.

<blank>

What the hell is this?

<blank>

Although puzzled by the sensation, which he had never felt before, he lined up with the moving ranks and drove Regulus.

The further you go, the wider and heavier the pain becomes.

<blank>

I felt as if something was falling out of me, and my chest began to feel suffocated.

When I pressed my chest unbearably, AnnaMarie noticed it and pulled her horse closer to me.

<blank>

Miss, can I help you?"

<blank>

I thought I smiled from behind my hood at AnnaMarie, who was worried about me, and told her I was fine.

But I could see AnnaMarie gasp as she peeked in.

What do I look like now?

<blank>

At this rate, we could be there in another hour or so!"

<blank>

Casey-san was shouting happily, while I was not.

From this point on, there are no cliffs or other obstacles, and the trail continues to ascend and descend gently, making it relatively easy for horses to run.

As long as you are careful of the monsters along the way, Casey said, you should be able to proceed with ease.

To which Mr. Luke answered in a taut voice.

<blank>

In contrast to the two of you, whose morale is on the rise, I am engulfed in an anxious, ankle-deep muddy feeling.

The sense of loss that is falling out of my heart is getting bigger and bigger inside me.

Am I about to lose something irretrievable at this very moment? Such anxieties were overflowing inside me.

Regulus, too, may have sensed something, and his breathing has been restless and labored since a while ago.

<blank>

<blank>

At that moment, something suddenly appeared that caught my search range.

It turns out that it is a myriad of living, non-being things.

And I could recognize the reactions of the living people who were surrounded by it.

But the number of people sensing it was smaller than the total number of survey teams that left the village. Besides, many of them had reduced vitality.

Some of them, several of them, seem to be overflowing with drops of life at any moment.

<blank>

I can see the loss of one of the lights of life in it. It is ......, and the light I know so well is .......

<blank>

Howard Dad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<blank>

I looked deep into the forest and shouted out loud.

Yes, this is Howard Papa! Definitely Howard Papa is there!

That powerful, blazing breath of Papa's life has become so thin!

<blank>

Miss?

What's wrong? What's going on!!!!"

<blank>

I sat up halfway and screamed, and AnnaMarie and Aria pulled their horses up to me and asked what was going on, but I couldn't answer them.

<blank>

Did you find the head?

I don't know." I don't ...... know, but your daughter would ......"

<blank>

Regulus, too, seemed to know what was going on, and his legs became stronger and his running speed increased.

Regulus passed Casey and Luke, who were ahead of him, to take the lead of the pack and continued to increase his speed.

But no! At this pace, no matter how fast we go, it will take almost an hour to get there!

<blank>

Regulus, sorry but ......"

<blank>

I was about to say, "I'll go first," but Regulus, running like a racehorse with no regard for pacing, increased his speed even faster.

I couldn't help but look at him with wide eyes as he ran with such spirit.

<blank>

...... Yes, Regulus. You wanted to get back to your dad too, right? Well, ...... yeah, I got it.

<blank>

Mr. Luke was surprised that we had passed him and asked what was going on, but instead of answering him, I pulled two silver and white swords from the sword holster at my waist, raised them above my head, and slowly shook them as if dancing while mounted on Regulus.

Then he uttered "Sho" as if in a whisper.

<blank>

"The Play of the Spirits.

It is a support magic for my original job as an "enchant channeler.

Small fairies with harps, drums, guitars, and other instruments of their choice play music, increasing the basic status of party members by 50 to 60%.

<blank>

Furthermore, he plays "Three Concertos".

<blank>

The "Battle Concerto" increases physical and magical attack power by 50% and 80%, respectively, and increases the rate of critical attacks and the damage when they occur by 40%.

《Move Concerto》 increases magical and physical attack speed by 80%, evasion rate by 70%, and doubles movement speed.

The "Relaxing Concerto" increases vitality by 70% and magical power by 60%, speeds up its recovery rate by 60%, greatly increases resistance to mental and physical abnormalities, and completely nullifies lower-level objects.

<blank>

It's been a while since I've had a full encha!

<blank>

<blank>

I could feel Regulus' surprise at the sensation of his increased running speed and jump in strength.

But I don't want you to be satisfied with this.

<blank>

'Well, wait a minute! There are still powerful demonic beasts ahead!"

<blank>

Mr. Casey is yelling from behind me that it is dangerous ahead, but I can see that from the beginning.

<blank>

I used items that had been sitting in my inventory for a long time.

Then Regulus' body is instantly enveloped in bronze-colored equipment.

The face even has a fang-like ornament protruding forward.

Well, this is a weapon as you see it.

<blank>

Originally this was equipment that was exclusively for mounted dragons in the game. ......

Could I possibly use this?　I pulled it out of my inventory and found that I could indeed use it!

I guess the "horse" in this world is a companion of the dragon? Is it possible that the "horse" in this world is a member of the dragon?

<blank>

<blank>

Then, as if to block our way, a magical beast appeared from among the trees.

Forest Giant."

A tree-like giant, over five meters tall, swung its thick, log-like arms down toward Regulus.

<blank>

Forest Giant has a threat value of 44.

Normally, you can't deal with them unless you are of the upper Dan rank.

Last night, Casey and Regulus were attacked by these guys on their way back to the village and came through the forest at night with severe damage.

Regulus has just had a painful experience, but now is not the time to be frightened! Regulus!

<blank>

Break it down, Regulus!

<blank>

Regulus didn't lose his momentum and plunged forward at his speed, shattering his log-like arms and sinking his fangs into the massive torso.

The Forest Giant was thrust through its body by Regulus and scattered, its huge body exploding with an explosion that shook the area.

<blank>

Yes, now Regulus would be a touch of armor!

The attack power of this equipment is still stronger than the weapons used by the Knights.

Enchantment, too, is in full effect!

There is no way that we can be behind this level of opponent!

<blank>

I say these words to Regulus, who understands his current power.

<blank>

Regulus, you're five minutes away. If you can't make it, I'll leave you at ......."

<blank>

Regulus sniffed once, as if to say, "I'll take care of it.

<blank>

Yeah?" ...... superior."

<blank>

I stood up quickly with my feet together on the saddle.

He rolled up his cloak with great vigor and drew his silver sword again, which he had just put back in its scabbard.

He pulled out his silver sword and spun it around in his hand, extending his arm out and aligning it horizontally up and down so that the tip of the sword was facing forward.

Then he releases the skill as it is.

<blank>

"Impulse burst.

It is a melee ranged attack skill of "Duel Barbarian".

Originally, it is a skill that is used on enemies in close proximity to you and engulfs the surrounding enemies, but thanks to the skill control training, you can now adjust the area of effect and power of the skill at your will, pretty much as you like.

<blank>

Ahead, "Gah!　and a skill is released from the tip of the sword, which opens as if cutting through space.

A shockwave born in front of the front of the building is propelled forward at the speed of sound in a straight line.

The shockwave sent a roar that tore through the air, slicing through the forest in front of us, along with dozens of forest giants that had been hiding in the trees.

In an instant, the forest was cleared by skill, and a single path of more than 100 meters was formed in front of us.

<blank>

I threw my sword back into the scabbard at my waist and re-gripped Regulus' reins. Then I use one more skill.

<blank>

《Riding Acceleration》

It is a skill that increases the speed of one's boarding vehicle by 200% for a short period of time.

<blank>

Go Regulus!"

<blank>

Regulus winds up and runs in a straight line through the forest.

<blank>

Howard Dad, just a few more moments please.

I'll be right with you!

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

◇◇◇◇◇

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

<blank>

I'm going to go to ...... and say, "Damn! I knew you'd fuck it up!"

We knew this was going to happen from the beginning. That's what we're here for, isn't it? Now, please think about going after your daughter as soon as possible.

'...... Yeah, you're right! You're absolutely right! Irta! Katie! Let's hurry up! Millie! Stop your huffing and puffing and get your ass over here!

<blank>

In front of the two knights, the young lady cut down the forest and the magical beast in an instant, and Lady Aria held her head in her hands.

However, I knew from the beginning that the young lady was going to do something.

We are here to follow up with them, so it's a little late for us to get our heads out of our asses.

<blank>

Still, everyone seemed quite surprised to see that the daughter's support magic had increased her power.

Me too, of course!

Ahh! Your daughter's power is flooding my body so much ....... What bliss!

<blank>

They are happy to see that they have smashed monsters such as Millie Barrett with a single blow from their bowguns.

That frolicking is adorable, but now we just have to move on!

<blank>

What the hell is this ......? You mean to tell me she did this? And this overflow of power! This is not the kind of magic an early class of people can use!

<blank>

Hmmm, I see that Master Luke has noticed your daughter's power. It is quite natural. ...... Would it be proper for us to take care of it here ......?

<blank>

Hey Luke! What are you doing? We've got to hurry!

<blank>

Master Aria stopped me with her hand as if to say, "Wait," and then she approached Master Luke.

<blank>

Aria! Is that girl really an early class 'diviner'? This is like a 'lyric poet'...... No, it's support magic that goes beyond the 'upper poet' class!"

Of course! She's definitely our 'soothsayer'!"

'Nonsense! It can't be a normal 'seer' by any stretch of the imagination!"

Of course not! No ordinary soothsayer can be on our team!

What?

Look at Millie! You've seen how good she is at spotting and attacking! Do you really think that a young hunter who has only just become a 4th grader is not a good enough member of a Class A team?

Yes, no, she is certainly much more capable ...... than the hunters in the field."

<blank>

I?　and pointing to yourself and making a scowling face is adorable, but I think you might want to pull a little tighter now, don't you? Millie Barrett .......

<blank>

I don't know if there is anyone in the Order who is as good at healing as I am! Is there a High Priest in the Order who is as good a healer as this guy?

No, no,......, there is no one. There are not many people as good as she is, even in the main body of the royal capital. ......

She is not a "Class A" team with the same level of ability! Don't underestimate her just because she's a "soothsayer"!

No, no! I do not underestimate her! It's just that the magic she used was too ......"

"That kid was always a ...... from the get-go, he's always had a high magic value. Compared to other kids her age, she was a dunce."

Is that so?

Yeah! I don't want to be compared to the people out there and the people at Amcam, though. That girl was out of the norm from the get go. And besides, women have days when their magic is temporarily boosted. ......, oops, I don't think it's knightly or manly of me to get any further into this conversation, do you? Luke Trevor!"

"...... ah, no, umm, this, this is ......, I'm very sorry ...... ah, umm, forgive me... ..."

<blank>

When Aria-sama gazes at him with her manly pout, Luke-sama's face turns red, his gaze swims, and he becomes sullen.

<blank>

Sasuga! Aria-sama! He ended Master Luke's doubts by forcefully and powerfully twisting them away! It is a complete show of force!

Good for you. Master Luke is a chor......gehngehngehngehngehngehngehngehngehn! He is an honest man. ......

<blank>

Now, if you don't hurry, your daughter will pull away from you with a bang in distance!

I am sure that the young lady noticed your husband's condition and chose to go all out.

Then it is not the time for us to be fretting!

<blank>

Come on." Let's go! That boy paved the way for us! Don't waste a minute, don't waste a second! Keep going!

<blank>

Lady Aria gave the order and whipped the horse to speed up quickly.

The horses are running at an unbelievable speed!

I am amazed that you can make a horse go this fast! Oh, Miss! It's wonderful! It's too nice!

Now, we must get to the main camp of the knighthood as soon as possible and help the lady to use her power to the fullest without worrying about the rear!

Ahh! Miss! I'll catch up with you right now!
