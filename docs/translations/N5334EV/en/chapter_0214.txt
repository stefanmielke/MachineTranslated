# Chapter 202: The Niven Brothers

I had understood from a young age that I was a special being.

<b>

While the other children desperately chased the insects dancing in the sky, I could simply reach out my hand lightly and catch them in my grasp.

I couldn't comprehend why they were so frantic over something so simple.

I felt nothing in particular when I squeezed my hand tightly and they abruptly ceased their activity.

I also couldn't understand the commotion of the other children watching me.

<b>

Before I had a clear understanding of the world, I must have wanted my parents' love like any other child, but that feeling had vanished without a trace at a rather early stage.

When I heard that my mother had passed away, I vaguely understood that it was related to the existence called father.

<b>

The father figure was neither someone to seek affection from nor a being to seek protection from.

Conversely, what he sought from me was simply, "Is it useful or not?" I had understood this quite early on.

<b>

However, that did not mean I particularly feared my father.

What this man sought was easy to understand. I merely had to constantly provide that, making him an incredibly easy being to deal with.

There was a time when I was severely struck with a cane, but it did not change my evaluation of this man in any significant way; I simply felt that it was just how things were. I had understood long ago that his true nature was a vile one.

<b>

For him, the world was easily flat and incredibly dull.

Yet, at one point, I realized that the reaction I displayed when disassembling small winged insects by tearing off their wings and legs gave me a slight stir of emotions.

It did not take long for me to recognize that this was 'joy' or 'pleasure.'

<b>

The moments I indulged in that pleasure were the only times I felt the world had any color.

The fact that the subjects of my interest gradually grew larger was a natural progression for me.

<b>

Still, the world remained as dull as ever.

<b>

The impulse smoldering within me, urging me to crush anything that opposed me with all my might, was likely something inherited from my father.

That nature was also evident in my younger brother, who was several years my junior.

However, unlike these two relatives, I recognized that such impulses were trivial.

I could easily suppress that impulse.

<b>

Every time I witnessed the two of them, who were prone to giving in to their impulses, it reminded me of their immaturity.

Especially my brother's behavior was no different from that of a toddler throwing a tantrum. I always saw it as proof of his stunted growth.

<b>

Observing them taught me just how foolish and vile the essence of humanity is.

<b>

Due to their half-hearted intelligence, humans are indeed a difficult existence to save.

Their narrow-mindedness, which can only measure things from their own perspective.

Their arrogance in believing their own sense of reason encompasses everything in this world.

Their inability to comprehend their own pettiness is simply beyond absurd.

<b>

The fact that I share kinship with such a despicable existence was utterly intolerable.

<b>

<b>

It was around this time that I felt a sense of despair at the constricting nature of that society.

I felt no allure in the world, only a void enveloping me.

<b>

Occasionally, I would crush people, organizations, or insects in a playful manner, merely to pass the time and alleviate my boredom.

For me, the world remained, as always, colorless and flat.

<b>

<b>

But one day, my world changed completely.

The moment I encountered him, I was captivated by his overwhelming presence.

For the first time in my life, witnessing such beauty and existence made me unknowingly kneel, my cheeks wet with tears.

At that moment, I realized just how small I truly was.

I understood that I was no better than those shameful beings.

<b>

However, the bliss I felt while kneeling before him.

For the first time in my life, I expressed gratitude for the guidance of the gods that led me to this being.

<b>

No! This being is the messenger of the gods. I have been discovered by him!

I was born to meet this being!

When I was convinced of this, I felt no hesitation in offering my soul to him.

<b>

And just the other day, I was finally permitted to ascend the stage.

Until now, I had only been granted a mere fraction of his precious power.

Even so, it was overwhelming joy, but now I had finally been allowed to go further.

<b>

That corpse-eating creature had crossed the boundary of humanity years before me, and arrogantly seemed to hold a sense of superiority over me.

However, when he realized that the favor of that being was heavily leaning towards me, he unnecessarily amplified his competitive spirit.

In the end, it was merely a foolish tale that showcased his lowly origins.

<b>

But now, I had finally become a being beyond the realm of humanity.

This joy and gratitude cannot be expressed in words.

I made a vow to demonstrate my commitment to this being through my actions by dedicating my entire self.

<b>

<b>

However, I cannot let the small insect that harmed this body go unpunished.

I know where it is.

I will head there now, and delivering an appropriate reward for its actions will be the first testament of my loyalty to that being.

<b>

◇◇◇◇◇

<b>

<b>

<b>

"I feel something ominous... Ruuiri, let's hurry."

"What?! Don't make me run in a place like this! Besides, Emma and Zoe aren't here!"

<b>

Reilly Niven, holding a long sword in his right hand, grasped Ruuiri Diet's hand with his left and ran down the path in the forest towards the campsite office.

<b>

Tonight, there might be an evacuation drill during the camp... Woodley and Ben had brought up such a discussion.

That information had been conveyed to the respective group leaders, so it was likely to be carried out without a doubt.

While I don't know when it will happen, the actions taken during that time would be added to individual scores, so it would be better to be prepared.

<b>

When I heard that, I purely thought, "How trivial."

Even so, this is a school with a proud tradition. It's only natural to value discipline.

At the same time, I also thought that I couldn't afford to tarnish the family name any further.

Just the other day, I had been under house arrest due to my father's crimes.

<b>

I heard that my father committed treason against the state. Honestly, I don't know what will happen next.

My father will likely not escape the death penalty. It’s a crime for which the entire family could be punished.

However, the family managed to avoid disaster by cutting ties with my father and brother.

<b>

After that, my maternal uncle told me, "You will be the one to inherit." 

He said that he and the others would assist me until I became independent.

To save my sickly mother, I had no choice.

But more than that, I was grateful.

<b>

I had been trembling in fear alone, thinking that we might also face severe punishment without understanding why.

But to receive such kindness... to know that my uncles were running around for that reason made me shed tears of gratitude.

<b>

<b>

"When the signal for assembly came, Emma twisted her ankle in a panic. Woodley and Ben are taking her to the medical tent. Zoe is accompanying them."

"Tch! Why now of all times! ...Useless!"

"We need to hurry too. We're quite behind the others."

"What?! Are you saying it's my fault?!"

"I'm not saying that. Just hurry up."

"Wait! Don't leave me behind! I'll run properly, so wait!"

<b>

Ruuiri Diet was still spewing curses, but her grip on Reilly's hand was firm, and her eyes never strayed from him.

The two of them silently held hands and hurried along the forest path illuminated by the bonfire.

<b>

Suddenly, a shadow loomed over them.

Tonight, the moon was hidden behind clouds, making it a night without moonlight.

In the depths of the forest, the pale blue light of the barrier device could be seen, but the only light source here was the bonfires placed here and there to illuminate the path.

The abnormality of a shadow falling from above made the two of them instinctively stop in their tracks.

<b>

"I didn't expect to find you here. I'm a bit surprised."

<b>

At the suddenly chilling voice, Reilly involuntarily widened his eyes.

<b>

"Ah! Brother?! Is that you, brother? Why... are you here?"

<b>

Reilly exclaimed in surprise.

The voice that suddenly echoed from the darkness was unmistakably that of his brother, the one who had driven them into a corner.

<b>

"However, depending on how you look at it, this might be convenient."

<b>

The face that emerged from the darkness was indeed that of Reilly's familiar brother.

<b>

"Just right. Shall we clean this up nicely here?"

<b>

But those eyes glowed red like embers, and the expression he wore while looking at Reilly was not one of kinship.

It was simply cold, devoid of any emotion.

<b>

"Why... why, brother! Why did you do such a thing?!"

"Such a thing?"

"I heard you harmed our father! And secretly brought in the military forces of another country! Such... such betrayal against our nation!!"

"Ha ha ha, what are you talking about... how trivial."

"Trivial?"

"The crossing of the Anatoris knights was indeed orchestrated by me, but it was that man's wicked heart that sought to bring them in. However, he couldn't even make proper use of that power. It merely reflects his incompetence. Moreover, the military forces of such a person were of no concern to me from the start."

<b>

"I... I have always... always looked up to you, brother! And yet... and yet...!!"

<b>

For Reilly, his older brother, acknowledged by everyone as exceptional, had been an object of admiration and a goal since childhood.

As he grew, he came to realize that it was something he could never reach.

In his frustration, he often lashed out at those around him.

<b>

Even so, he would be elated or disheartened by the words occasionally spoken by Van.

Even understanding that his brother was out of reach, his feelings remained unchanged.

<b>

Someday, he wanted to be recognized by his brother.

Someday, he wanted to become someone who could help his brother.

<b>

That was the thought he had held in his heart since long ago.

<b>

"That is precisely the proof that you do not understand your own limitations. The very thought of you reaching out is absurd."

"Th-that's..."

<b>

"Van! That is far too cruel! Reilly has worked hard all this time, looking up to you! Even knowing it was out of reach... still!!"

"So what? What does it matter that he made such a meaningless effort? What will it achieve? It is all futile from the start. Just a waste of time. And you want me to acknowledge that? Do you intend to waste my time as well?"

"…brother?"

"What?! What are you... what are you saying?!"

<b>

At Van's words, Reilly felt his strength drain from his body, and he was about to kneel on the spot.

Ruuiri wrapped her arms around his body, supporting the weakened Reilly, and involuntarily raised her voice.

However, Ruuiri's eyes widened in disbelief at the words that continued to spill from Van's mouth.

<b>

"Despite having arranged everything, you all failed to achieve any results, proving your own incompetence."

"W-what are you talking about...?"

"About Karen. I suppressed her will and directed your consciousness to crush her heart..."

"W-what...?"

"In the end, Karen's heart never broke. It must be due to the difference in their original dispositions. The strength of her will and the pitiful nature of yours. Truly pathetic."

<b>

"Were we... doing something... to her? ...Ugh!"

<b>

Ruuiri pressed her mouth to her throat as a wave of nausea surged up.

<b>

Indeed, Karen was an unpleasant person to her. She understood the reason.

She also understood that her own personality was hard to control.

She knew very well that she would quickly lose her temper and let her blood rush to her head without needing anyone to tell her.

<b>

However, her feelings toward Karen became even harder to suppress than usual.

The dark rage that surged toward Karen was something she never felt elsewhere.

It swelled easily, turning her vision red.

A sensation of losing herself. Yet, she found it strange.

<b>

But was that something imposed from the outside?

The thought that her heart was being eroded by something made Ruuiri Diet feel nauseous.

<b>

"Only able to rely on the power of your family, lacking in intelligence and courage. You are nothing but spoiled fools."

<b>

Van coldly delivered his words to the pale-faced Ruuiri.

<b>

"The very fact that you still exist is tantamount to frivolously diminishing my value."

<b>

Van raised his hand and lightly flicked his fingers, producing a dry sound.

As that sound echoed, Reilly and Ruuiri were still unaware that multiple presences were moving from the darkness behind Van.

<b>

"Meet your miserable end here, torn apart."

<b>

"He is your brother?! He is... just a brother who admired you, isn't he?! And yet! And yet!!"

<b>

Ruuiri raised a pained voice while still holding onto Reilly's body in response to Van's cold words.

Unknowingly, her arms tightened around him as if to protect him.

<b>

"That hand that has clung to me since long ago has been quite bothersome."

<b>

With a cold gaze, Van uttered those words just as something leaped from the shadows behind him toward the two.

<b>

As its form was illuminated by the bonfire, Ruuiri finally caught sight of its vicious appearance.

A four-legged beast with red eyes.

Its mouth, growling, was filled with sharp fangs arranged haphazardly.

<b>

For a moment, Ruuiri was astonished, not understanding what was happening.

But she quickly realized that it was bearing its fangs with malice toward them, and she instinctively tensed her arms, tightly closing her eyes.

<b>

She could feel the beast's growl closing in on her ears.

As she braced herself for its vicious fangs to sink into her, she felt her body tense even more.

<b>

What entered her ears was a high-pitched scream, like a wail from the beast.

<b>

What had happened? Ruuiri thought as she slowly opened her eyes, and what she saw was several mountain dogs frozen mid-leap, pierced by multiple thorns sprouting from the ground.

The magical beasts known as "Terra Dogs" were skewered, blood pouring from their mouths and eyes, dying on the spot.

<b>

"Yikes?!"

<b>

Ruuiri let out a scream at the gruesome sight.

<b>

"Huh?!"

<b>

Van instantly extended the claws of his right hand like a dagger and swung his arm vigorously to slash through the darkness behind him.

Immediately, a sharp metallic sound echoed around, and sparks flew.

<b>

"I didn't know my night vision was this good. Indeed, it's like dogs and cats."

<b>

The massive blade of a two-handed sword emerged, illuminated by the sparks.

Though it was held back by Van's claw-like dagger, it did not yield, grinding against it with a grating sound.

<b>

"Let's wrap this up already."

<b>

With a ferocious grin, Arvin Haggard declared challengingly.
